Text: "In the summer of 2018 i went to Brazil looking for a lady. She had brown hair\
  \ and blue eyes, as far as i remember. A few days before the trip this lady appeared\
  \ on my dreams sitting by a gorgeous blue lake. She asked me my name and said: it\
  \ doesn't matter because you will return to this place. And then i woke up. I can't\
  \ explain the feeling. I never felt like that in my entire life. It was like i could\
  \ bring something from the dream to reality because she was the element connecting\
  \ both worlds. Blue lake, blue lake, i kept repeating to myself. I tried to paint\
  \ it but it didn't do any good, i couldn't see it, it wasn't the same blue. Actually\
  \ i couldn't even find the right blue in the shop, it was like something or someome\
  \ inside my subconscious had created this blue just for my dream's scenario. A few\
  \ days after the dream, i went to bed a little bit frustrated because i couldn't\
  \ figure how to find this blue lake, this unique place. I watched a bad movie and\
  \ i felt asleep. And there she was, the lady, the lake, and the stanning blue. She\
  \ didn't speak to me that time. She sang, a lot and very, very low. Like she was\
  \ singing a lullaby. Was she trying to make me sleep in my dream?  I tried to get\
  \ what the song was about but i couldn't understand the words except for one: Brazil.\
  \ \nNext morning i bought the first (and the cheapest)  flight ticket i found. I\
  \ had no clue how to start looking. Once or twice i stopped, looked myself on the\
  \ mirror and thinked: am i insane? Have i totally lost it? Maybe i was, maybe i\
  \ had. But i was so sure, it was so real to me. How can i turn my back to a feeling\
  \ like that? \nSo i did it. Two weeks later i was walking on the beach in Arraial\
  \ d'ajuda, thinking about how crazy that was. I thought I was losing my mind when\
  \ a few meters ahead me i saw a lady all alone sitting by a lake. I walked to her.\
  \ I couldn't feel my feet. Was she real? Was i real? \"Yes, i'm real\", i said outloud.\
  \ So what was she?. There she was, the lady of my dreams, with brown hair and blue\
  \ eyes. And there was the lake beautifully blue. She looked my straight in the eyes\
  \ and said: you are finally here."
