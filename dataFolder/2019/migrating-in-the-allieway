Text: "Have you ever found yourself nearing a fork in the road? The past is chasing\
  \ you like an apocalyptic avanlache while the future is a tall tree. Where do you\
  \ go next? Do you climb the tree or allow yourself to get trampled? \nFour years\
  \ ago, my husband and I separated. My job and home life seemed to become a carousel\
  \ of late night benders & random hook ups. I was desperate to shake things up! Within\
  \ a month I sold my life for cheap and packed all my favorite items into a Scion\
  \ XB. Off I went on the PCH with no direction in sight just the sun. \nThere were\
  \ only three items on the itinerary; explore, eat and be fearless. Of course before\
  \ you jet set on any road trip, it is imperative you bring along a trusty map! One\
  \ that has cute pictures of all the weird attractions in the United States. (World\u2019\
  s Largest Chicken wing anyone?) There I was heading East, when all of a sudden I\
  \ hear a rumble. The one last warning your stomach gives you before it\u2019s too\
  \ late! With not a toilet in sight, I had to pull over in the hot desert where a\
  \ hole held all of my dignity. It was not my finest moment but it made me feel more\
  \ RAW, like a true indigenous American! (Don\u2019t worry I wiped myself) \nFew\
  \ hours after my \u201CI am Woman, See me Poop\u201D I followed a complete stranger\
  \ to what I thought was a secret corn maze but instead it was the beginning of what\
  \ would have a missing persons! Thank goodness I caught on early enough to double\
  \ back and keep heading forward! \nMy dad got wind of this story, (he was tracking\
  \ me) bought a ticket to meet me. Mind you I had only been on my own for 48 hours\
  \ and it had been the best 48 hours of my life. I hiked the Grand Canyon, pooped\
  \ in the desert, almost got kidnapped, jumped nude in a public hot spring & got\
  \ caught in the coolest Colorado storm I had ever seen! \nBy the time I picked up\
  \ my father at the airport, I felt like a world traveler ( I had only driven through\
  \ three states) My father was on a mission to get me back home and I was on a mission\
  \ to never go back. But I did! \nThe trip went from escaping reality to facing it.\
  \ My father and I had never spent more than a day together and now we were on an\
  \ endless road trip. The best way I thought to open up the relationship was through\
  \ edibles. We spent the whole night laughing about tacos! It was quite beautiful.\
  \ It really put our relationship on the map! (Get it!) As we traveled through various\
  \ states he really started to open up. We talked about our relationship, learned\
  \ about where I came from and we sang every Journey song that ever existed. We built\
  \ a bond that I forgot about my agenda. I was focused on rebuilding. He really opened\
  \ my eyes to what I was running away from. Life! \nNo matter where you are, or who\
  \ you are with it\u2019s you that needs the fixing. It\u2019s you who has to open\
  \ your eyes to the sun and allow for it to awaken you! I had no idea packing my\
  \ car and driving back East would bring me closer to my dad which then brought me\
  \ back to my husband. My past was rolling behind me but it was I who chose to snowboard\
  \ it down the hill."
