Text: "\u201CPeople labeled you as unfazed,\u201D my friend Emily says as we sit in\
  \ a solar powered hot tub in Guatemala. The power is out everywhere. We are speaking\
  \ to each other in the dim light of candles and cellphone flashlights. \u201CWhat\
  \ are your thoughts on that?\u201D \n\tI didn\u2019t think I was completely desensitized\
  \ to chaos. I suppose when a fire the size of a full-grown human ignites a small\
  \ shack at a yoga retreat center on Lake Atitlan, one should probably freak out.\
  \ Everyone else did, but not me. \n\tMy fellow white women love to worry in foreign\
  \ places. We\u2019d been in Guatemala for only three days and so far I\u2019ve had\
  \ to talk them away from panic several times. \n\t\u201CIs my suitcase going to\
  \ fall off the top of the boat?\u201D \n\t\u201CAre you sure I can brush my teeth\
  \ with the tap water?\u201D \n\t\u201CWhy isn\u2019t there any toilet paper in the\
  \ bathroom?\u201D\n\tMy favorite part was when they would complain about the beautiful\
  \ things they purchased for themselves back in America not being perfect enough.\
  \ \n\t\u201CMy skyline bungalow is 70 steps uphill, don\u2019t you think that\u2019\
  s a bit much? Should I  switch rooms?\u201D \n\t\u201CCost Rica had so many pretty\
  \ birds, why doesn\u2019t Guatemala have as many pretty birds?\u201D \n\tI\u2019\
  d held the hands of women twice my age giving them assurance that we won\u2019t\
  \ die if we don\u2019t have toilet paper. So when the dinner conversation shifted\
  \ from their adult children to the burning smell in the air for twenty minutes,\
  \ I assured Connie, Deb, Rosanne, and Beverly that we will not die in a fire at\
  \ a yoga retreat in Guatemala. That was until I saw six foot tall flames out the\
  \ window of the dining room. \n\tAt first I thought it was a purposeful fire, possibly\
  \ an unexpected Mayan Fire Ceremony. Then I saw the fire belonged to a small shack\
  \ containing pool equipment and propane tanks. Americans were being Americans about\
  \ it. They tried to follow a procedure they learned in grade school that doesn\u2019\
  t apply to fire procedures in Guatemala. They wanted to call 911, but that didn\u2019\
  t exist. They wanted to find a fire extinguisher. They wanted to find the quickest\
  \ and most efficient solution. The Guatemalan people at the hotel did not run towards\
  \ the fire to immediately put it out. They grabbed all the buckets they could and\
  \ filled them with water. The Americans ran all over the hotel in search of a fire\
  \ extinguisher, and were successful in finding one in the kitchen.\n\tDuring this\
  \ small moment of chaos, lasting five minutes in total, the Guatemalan people threw\
  \ buckets of water onto the roof of the shack. One American put another American\
  \ onto their shoulders. Together they sprayed down the top of the hut, and the fire\
  \ was gone. \n\tFive minutes of panic and the fire was over, but the panic remained.\
  \ The older generations sat at a table to analyze the moment over and over. They\
  \ discussed their heroic efforts. \n\t\u201CThat was so scary, right? I mean, the\
  \ workers in the kitchen didn\u2019t even notice it. What if we never said anything?\u201D\
  \n\tI rolled my eyes to these comments. After a few more minutes on the subject\
  \ of the American\u2019s great defeat of the fire, I went to my room to put on my\
  \ swim suit and sit in the hot tub alone. So yes, I was unfazed. Yes I didn\u2019\
  t get worked up. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019ve had my life in the hands of foreigners.\
  \ Maybe it\u2019s because I trusted their process, and knew we would all be okay.\
  \ \n\tInstead of saying all of this to Emily and Beverly who was always tight-lipped\
  \ and loved to talk about her failed Tinder dates, I told them I had way crazier\
  \ shit happen to me. I\u2019ve lost my phone, wallet, and glasses in the ocean in\
  \ Bali, I\u2019ve had bedbugs three times in Vietnam, I\u2019ve almost died on several\
  \ boats. I\u2019ve used the Thai medical system. \n\tIn America, I have the option\
  \ to be particular. I have the option to complain. When I\u2019m in an unknown place,\
  \ I trust the locals. I become unfazed."
