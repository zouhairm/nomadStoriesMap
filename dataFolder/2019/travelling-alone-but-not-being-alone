Text: "\u2018You know what\u2019s funny?\u2019 he chuckled. \u2018We\u2019ll have\
  \ been together longer whilst travelling compared to our whole relationship so far.\u2019\
  \ \n\nI groaned. Finally, I have this amazing guy in my life\u2026and of course,\
  \ I won\u2019t be seeing him for the next 4 months. \n\nIt was the inevitable pressure\
  \ that lingered since we first met. Our upcoming adventures were going to be life-changing\
  \ experiences. Would we still be together by the time we both left? Did we want\
  \ to be single whilst travelling? Would we be devastated and heartbroken if we pulled\
  \ the plug just before we left and completely tamper our trips with a sense of melancholy?\
  \ \n\nIt was on the day that I packed my suitcase for the first of many times that\
  \ I think we both realised we really wanted to be in a relationship, even if it\
  \ was long distance. \u2018Want\u2019 may actually be a strong word, because it\u2019\
  s not the most ideal relationship you\u2019d want with anyone, be that with friends,\
  \ family or lovers. \n\nLuckily, we\u2019re both quite independent people. Alone\
  \ time is something we both value. We both have our goals and ideal sense of how\
  \ we want our lives to be. For me, that meant spending every dollar I\u2019ve ever\
  \ earned on the stereotypical white girl Europe trip with my best friend. For my\
  \ partner, that meant working in the US and travelling solo. \n\nSo how do you deal\
  \ with this? You can read plenty of the inspirational tips and wanky quotes like\
  \ \u2018love has no distance\u2019 and whatnot, but the truth is, it\u2019s not\
  \ that simple and it really sucks. \n\nYou\u2019re in different time zones. Some\
  \ days you won\u2019t even reach Wi-Fi. Calling will be difficult and if you\u2019\
  re lucky enough to Facetime, you\u2019ll be pressed for time. It will be overwhelming\
  \ some days. It\u2019ll be depressing when they\u2019re not there to chat with you\
  \ on a bad day. You won\u2019t want to tell them about the bad days in case they\
  \ worry and you ruin their fun. Texts can be so easily misunderstood and misread.\
  \ You might clash and struggle to communicate properly, and in the end when you\
  \ finally apologise, you can\u2019t show them the sincerity in your eyes or hug\
  \ to accept forgiveness. \n\nIt\u2019s hard being in an early relationship and being\
  \ long distance because you\u2019re still figuring each other out: what jokes are\
  \ appropriate, how to bring up sensitive information, what even are the rules in\
  \ your relationship? Do you have expectations of each other? \n\nIn saying that\u2026\
  \n\nYou realise how much you value your significant other. I\u2019m so excited when\
  \ my phone buzzes from him. I gleam with warmth when he tells me how much fun he\u2019\
  s having doing things he never thought he\u2019d ever do. I\u2019m so proud of the\
  \ work he\u2019s doing, as well as how far he\u2019s pushing himself out of his\
  \ previously closed comfort zone. I don\u2019t mope and get frustrated that he can\
  \ be this happy without me \u2013 because he\u2019s still with me. Sharing his experiences\
  \ is so inviting and thrilling that I do feel part of it also. I can feel him growing\
  \ as a person with every message and it\u2019s such a unique feeling to say how\
  \ impressed I am because of that. It\u2019s odd to put it into writing, which proves\
  \ it\u2019s something I\u2019ve rarely ever felt for a person before. \n\nWhen you\u2019\
  re both travelling, you get to boast about the wild days you\u2019ve had. At some\
  \ points you\u2019ll have no idea where each other is exactly and it\u2019s so engaging\
  \ to share your adventures. Hearing from each other is not an expectation as much\
  \ as it is a privilege. \n\nIn the end, every relationship is completely unique,\
  \ so this is completely biased. It may or may not work out and that\u2019s just\
  \ the way things pan out sometimes. \n\nMore than anything, I\u2019m just fixated\
  \ on the fantasy of when I\u2019ll see him for the first time again, and if being\
  \ happy to see each other isn\u2019t what your relationship is all about than maybe\
  \ you need to give travelling a go too."
