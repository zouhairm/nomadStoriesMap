Text: "For many, Latin America seems like this big cluster in which everybody speaks\
  \ Spanish, dances salsa and eats spicy. As a Venezuelan, I can tell you that's not\
  \ the case. My salsa skills are still doubtful and I cannot eat a jalape\xF1o without\
  \ crying. \n\nHowever, that's not the case for Ar\xF3n, my partner, a pure \"chilango\"\
  \ born and raised in Mexico City. Now one year into the relationship, he invited\
  \ me to spend some time with him in the capital, promising me he wouldn't hide chiles\
  \ in my food and protect me from my naivet\xE9. I booked my plane ticket and landed\
  \ at midnight. There he was, waiting for me with his shiny black shoes, a white\
  \ shirt tucked into his pants, gel in his hair and roses in his hands. \"Bienvenida,\
  \ amor\", were his words. \"Do you want to go for tacos?\"\n\nOf course I said yes!\
  \ \n\nThe next days were close to perfection. He made me discover the streets through\
  \ his eyes, frowning upon all touristic attractions. He took me to the outskirts\
  \ of the city and told me \"Taste this, amor\" to then laugh \"That was cow tongue\
  \ you just ate\". I also added grasshoppers called chapulines into my regular diet\
  \ and drank pulque, an ancestral drink previously reserved to royalty only. \"Come\
  \ dance with me\", he said. I probably stepped on his foot between two turns, but\
  \ he never said a word. \n\nTime went by and, on a Sunday night, a woman was assaulted\
  \ right in front of me. We were in the car, driving back home, when two men on a\
  \ moto slammed her onto the pavement and took her purse. On another occasion, when\
  \ we went to the city centre, Ar\xF3n whispered to my ear \"We're being followed...\
  \ On the count of three, run as hard as you can\". \n\nSometimes, I felt how my\
  \ mind went numb. When children asked me for money, I never knew what to say. \"\
  Don't give a single peso to them\", would say my partner, \"It's not okay for parents\
  \ to keep their kids from going to school\". But on the other side, would the child\
  \ get punished if he or she came back empty handed? These were hard decisions to\
  \ make considering the poverty rates of the country and the quantity of children\
  \ that did not graduate. It was even harder when they would come to me while I was\
  \ eating at a restaurant or shopping. How could I tell them that I had no money\
  \ on me? That was the epitome of privilege.\n\nNights were cold in Mexico City.\
  \ The kind of cold that chilled my bones and turned our breaths visible. When my\
  \ partner and I couldn't handle it, we would go for a warm caf\xE9 de olla and cuddle\
  \ under the think blanket of his bed. Life was simple back then. But, one day, I\
  \ woke up and it was March already. That meant that I would have to go back home\
  \ soon, but I no longer knew where was home anymore. With him? Back with my parents?\
  \ The traffic of the city had become so normal to me and so was the oily Mexican\
  \ diet that lacked a few vegetables. I still didn't get used to the smog that hid\
  \ the stars or the smelly garbage in the streets, but did that really matter?\n\n\
  The day I left, we went for tacos one last time and hugged until he told me \"Enough,\
  \ amor, it's time\". I remember crossing the security border and turning back one\
  \ last time. There he was. With all of our memories in his eyes and a hand on his\
  \ heart. \n\nIn the background, I could hear Christian Nodal's song, \"Adi\xF3s\
  \ Amor\". Goodbye my love..."
