Text: "A Russian and an Egyptian girl went to see a beautiful waterfall in northern\
  \ Morocco, we didn\u2019t know that we would end up hiking for 5 hours, the time\
  \ now is 2 PM, the sun will set while we\u2019re still hiking! \u201CWe started\
  \ something we should finish it!\u201D - said the Russian girl.\nWe didn\u2019t\
  \ have a lighter or food to eat after reaching the waterfall!\n\u201CI have a small\
  \ water bottle and 2 biscuits, the mobile has a fair flash!\u201D -said the Egyptian\
  \ girl\nWe didn\u2019t have any gear but a curious soul and idiot brain. We\nStarted\
  \ walking, meeting the people who completed their journey and going back before\
  \ nightfall. Walking, walking and walking, 4 hours gone by in an instant! We started\
  \ to get tired and feel hungry and the weather is so hot. we lied on a rock, it\
  \ was so cold! The weather was cold, but we didn't it feel because of the adrenaline\
  \ rush, we stayed in the comfort zone for 10 minutes and the monkeys came as if\
  \ to almost say - keep going there is no much time to sleep here!\nAfter one more\
  \ hour of walking among nature, only nature was around us, mountains, waterfalls,\
  \ birds\u2019 singing, and two curious souls\nFinally, we reached the biggest waterfall\
  \ in northern Morocco \u201CAkshor\u201D or as they called it \u201Cthe paradise\
  \ of Morocco\u201D\nWas the name just a coincidence? Is it because it\u2019s beautiful\
  \ or because the way to it takes time, energy and patience like the actual Paradise!\n\
  \ It was the first question that came into my idiot brain that we didn\u2019t research\
  \ about the place before getting to it.\nAfter 15 minutes of getting some comfort,\
  \ we headed to the same road to go back.\nWe were stopped by the sound of a hungry\
  \ cat, we have only 2 biscuits, we ate one and gave her the other one, it\u2019\
  s an idiot like us so we\u2019re 3 idiots now!\nThe road at night was so different,\
  \ the lesson now is different, be brave and take care of your companion and don\u2019\
  t be selfish.\nOur steps were so fast but the time wasn\u2019t flying as it\u2019\
  s used to be while traveling\nNo sounds, lights, food. Avoid your nervousness and\
  \ continue to your main goal (reaching the transportation point to go home)\nAfter\
  \ many miles and too much negative thinking inside each one\u2019s brain, we\u2019\
  ve finally reached the point but there\u2019s no people or transportation.\nJust\
  \ strangers, nomads with long hair and an old backpack,\nthey helped us to reach\
  \ a transportation point and get home after 2 hours.\nI felt I grew up one year\
  \ in just 1 day, my idiot brain has matured a little.\nI became more kind, curious\
  \ about life and appreciate for the friendship"
