Text: "It\u2019s July in Tehran, and the sunlight bounces off marble buildings with\
  \ fierce ripples of arid heat. In the spring, when the city blooms with flowers,\
  \ the irrigation canals that flank every street swell with swift currents of cool\
  \ mountain water rushing into the valleys of lower Tehran. Well-heeled girls deftly\
  \ maneuver the metal crosswalks that punctuate them, scarves fluttering behind them.\
  \ Now, the canals run dry. As dusk settles in, the streets of north Tehran will\
  \ come to life. A bustling lipstick lot will park their cars in hordes and eat ice\
  \ cream and cakes adorned with chocolate curls at coffee shops in Velenjak or Elahiye,\
  \ with boys who wear skinny jeans and sport bluetooth earbuds. For now, the streets\
  \ are sparse, spare a flagging few who go about their business.\n\nYet if you follow\
  \ the wave of cars that weaves southward like a mighty python, you\u2019ll find\
  \ a city that heaves. Girls whose headscarves fall back behind dyed hair piled high\
  \ push through the crowded pavements of Khayyam Street, past swathes of \u201Cchadoris,\u201D\
  \ women who grip the long black capes pulled taut around their heads tightly in\
  \ their teeth, past sweaty men in collared shirts and colorful plastic slippers,\
  \ and past children whose mothers drag them swiftly by street vendors sitting on\
  \ cardboard selling gum. Turn right, and you fall eastward into a swell of dome-topped\
  \ towering passageways, the expansive labyrinth known to all as \u201CBazaar Tehran.\u201D\
  \ Motorbikes whiz through the narrow causeways, towing colossal piles of goods that\
  \ will knock you sideways unless you step out of the way. Shopkeepers sit in corners\
  \ of their dens sipping tea, or stand grinning and joking about the costs of their\
  \ wares.\n\nSome come for carpets, some for gold, some for appliances, some merely\
  \ for socks. Everyone comes for the \u201Cchelo kabab.\u201D My favorite can be\
  \ found at Sharaf-ol-Eslami restaurant, a few steps beneath an unassuming sign among\
  \ the silver merchants. \n\nThere is no need to know its name\u2014ask anyone in\
  \ this section of the bazaar where to eat and they\u2019ll send you there.\n\nInside\
  \ Sharaf-ol-Eslami, the aroma of saffron fills the air. Crowds clamor to order piles\
  \ of steaming rice and sword-skewered kababs, served on plastic trays with foil-topped\
  \ containers of yoghurt or salad, alongside cups of soda, or a sour minty yoghurt\
  \ drink called \u201Cdoogh.\u201D It sounds like an exaggeration to say so, but\
  \ violent outbursts among ravenous patrons are not unheard of here. Iranians take\
  \ their food seriously. I once saw two distinguished-looking men knock each other\
  \ over to grab a seat. If I\u2019ve ever thrown shade with any competence in my\
  \ life, it was here, over a table that a swifter, more wily woman stole from under\
  \ my nose.\n\nChelo kabab\u2013buttered, saffron-flavored steamed rice and fire-grilled\
  \ kababs of \u201Ckoobideh\u201D (minced lamb), \u201Cbarg\u201D (lamb steak), or\
  \ \u201Cjoojeh\u201D (Cornish hen), served with grilled tomatoes, and sometimes\
  \ a raw egg cracked on top, all doused in powdered sumac\u2013is Iran\u2019s most\
  \ abundant traditional restaurant food. In homes, tables run over with aromatic\
  \ stews that are by turns fruity, tart and sour, and rice dotted with berries, lentils\
  \ or herbs. But outside, city dwellers from all corners of Tehran pile into bazaar\
  \ basements, or sit cross-legged on Persian rugs under fruit trees in the orchards\
  \ of Darake, Farahzad, or Kan Sologhon. They smoke hookah, sip tea, and eat chelo\
  \ kabab, which is just as satisfying on a scorching summer night as in snowy winter,\
  \ when the city\u2019s irrigation canals run fast with icy water, and affluent youths\
  \ from northern neighborhoods wake at dawn to race up the mountains surrounding\
  \ Tehran, snowboards strapped to the roofs of their cars.\n\nThey often stop for\
  \ hot breakfast bowls of haleem, a salty wheat and shredded turkey porridge, on\
  \ their way to the slopes of Dizin or Darbandsar. They share highways with the five-to-a-motorbike\
  \ families of Tehran\u2019s southern neighborhoods, speeding along with children\
  \ balanced precariously on their handlebars. \n\nLikely some will cross paths again\
  \ later, pausing alike in the twilight hours for a steaming plate of chelo kabab\
  \ on their way back down into the dense metropolis."
