Text: 'There is no denying that every trip changes a little bit from us. It is impossible
  to travel to a different place, to experience new things, to live incredible adventures
  and then to return to the routine as if nothing had happened. March 5, 2017 I made
  my first plane trip to Sao Paulo-Brazil, it was an unforgettable trip, I met incredible
  people, including other nationalities, to know new cultures was something transformative
  and magical. I met famous places like: Oscar Freire, Ibirapuera Park, Batman Alley,
  Tomie Ohtake Institute, Avenina Paulista among others. It was incredible to know
  the MASP the permanent collection has no walls and is composed of several works
  of national and international authors organized chronologically. In the middle of
  them, beautiful works by Van Gogh, Picasso, Di Cavalcanti and Tarsila do Amaral!
  Travel opens our horizons and our perspectives on the world. When we mix with the
  crowd we feel we are just a drop in the ocean. Prospects widen. There is a renovation.
  And the distance you take is not what matters. It could be a trip to Finland, Salvador,
  Beijing, or that town close to home. Traveling is not simply going from one place
  to another. It means much more than that. It is looking at life from other angles.
  It is to experience the new, the unusual, the different. Break paradigms, overturn
  prejudices, dive into new concepts. To travel is to change the clothes of the soul.
  It is to be enchanted by the world.

  As the great writer Miguel de Cervantes used to say, "Walking through distant lands
  and talking to many people makes men considerate."'
