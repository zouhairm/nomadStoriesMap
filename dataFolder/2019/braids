Text: "We cycled along at an increasingly slower pace. The traffic barely moved to\
  \ our left. It was dusty. Just the day before were easily rolling along quiet, smooth\
  \ pavement, Vietnam\u2019s deep greens saturating our peripheral vision, a spare\
  \ motorbike rolling past now and again, its driver grinning and waving. Today, our\
  \ bums were sore, our legs ached, this awful traffic, the persistent horns that\
  \ were not going to get anyone, anywhere, the dust.\n\nAs we crept over the crest\
  \ of a small hill, we began to see the culprit of the backup of vehicles already\
  \ too big for that stretch of The Ho Chi Minh Highway, a stretch which was plagued\
  \ by construction that surely wouldn\u2019t be finished for years to come. It was\
  \ a gathering of people surrounding, undoubtedly, a motorbike accident. After nine\
  \ months living in Ho Chi Minh City we\u2019d seen enough of them and knew there\
  \ was nothing to be done but to shake our heads at the lack of helmets and what\
  \ we deemed common-sense safety, and move on. But as the slim tires of the road\
  \ bike beneath me kept moving me forward, our kit came into focus.\n\nWe were on\
  \ our fifth day out of Hanoi, there were 19 of us all together. We\u2019d each hit\
  \ our personal strides, found our individual tempos. We sometimes rode in pairs,\
  \ but often rode alone, and though we were not an hour into that day, we\u2019d\
  \ spread out, our matching blue and white H2H kits bobbing along at various speeds\
  \ down the highway.\n\nFirst it was our kit that came into focus, then it was the\
  \ braids. Two long, blonde, pigtail braids. That\u2019s how she\u2019d done her\
  \ hair that morning. It was a constant struggle to simultaneously keep our hair\
  \ from knotting in the wind, off our sweaty back and necks, and not interfering\
  \ with our helmets. Hers was longer than mine, so she could braid it. She was my\
  \ person. And she was in the middle of a group of Vietnamese people on the side\
  \ of the highway five days of cycling south of Hanoi.\n\nFirst it was our kit that\
  \ came into focus, then it was the braids, then it was her leg. By the time I\u2019\
  d identified her as my person my bike had been gone from underneath me, tossed away\
  \ from the traffic, off the shoulder, the black earbud cord which, each morning,\
  \ I carefully threaded through my helmet straps and plugged into my iPod swung back\
  \ and forth in front of me, pulled without thought, abruptly pausing the playlist\
  \ which blasted into my ears each day, it now in the ditch alongside my bike. I\
  \ was running.\n\nHer leg. My dismount had been quick and I was getting closer to\
  \ her, I could really see it now and I stopped, mid stride, and I screamed. A scream\
  \ that had no source, no precedent in my calm, easy keeled demeanor, but came from\
  \ every fiber of my being. I looked at the woman I\u2019d been riding with, just\
  \ behind me, her eyes somehow told me to calm down. And I did. We both did.\n\n\
  I reached the cluster, I skirted around the back of her blue and white kit sat there\
  \ on the pavement, I pushed away the circle of Vietnamese who were doing nothing\
  \ to help my person, and I crouched down on her right side, I put my hand on her\
  \ shoulder. She looked at me like I imagine a child might look at its mother. I\
  \ was there and somehow, I was going to make things alright for her. I was her person.\n\
  \nI think my ankles broken, she said to me. \n\nHer left calf had been separated\
  \ from her body, it was still attached, but just barely. The ribbons of her muscles,\
  \ the whites of her ligaments, her tibia, it was all visible. Bits of her flesh\
  \ were stuck in the treads of the tire which had run her over. A tire which belonged\
  \ to a 12-wheeler. There was blood on the ground, on her shoes, on her socks. \n\
  \nI think it might be, I admitted to her.\n\nI haven\u2019t looked, her voice trembled.\n\
  \nDon\u2019t, I replied."
