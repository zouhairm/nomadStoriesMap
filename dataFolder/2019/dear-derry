Text: "Over the course of the festive season, I travelled to from a sunny and warm\
  \ South Africa to your city walls and frosty shores with no expectations other than\
  \ cold, wet and windy conditions and that the city I was entering is the subject\
  \ of U2\u2019s hit, \u201CSunday Bloody Sunday\u201D.\n\nAfter a quick pop into\
  \ a local pub upon arrival, I made my way Guildhall to meet my city walking tour\
  \ guide, Ronan. By a mile, Ronan is one of the most fascinating characters I have\
  \ ever had the privilege of coming across. In his own definition, he is a Buddhist-\
  \ Irishman living amongst a Catholic and Protestant community- an unfathomable notion\
  \ in Derry thirty years ago. Ronan came highly recommended, famed for his storytelling\
  \ and ability to entrench you into the heart of Derry. Part of my reasoning for\
  \ visiting this corner of the globe was that I come from a mixed Catholic and Protestant\
  \ family and given the history between the two over the years in Northern Ireland,\
  \ I was curious to see how times had changed. I was not disappointed.\n\nWe made\
  \ our way through the streets at dusk with the soft-spoken Ronan giving us an overview\
  \ of the history of Derry right from the sole monastery to the times of the Troubles.\
  \ Standing underneath the streetlights in Bogside, our guide\u2019s tales served\
  \ as a narrative as we took in our surroundings and allowed our imaginations to\
  \ bring his words to life. As he spoke, my gaze was fixated on the Nelson Mandela\
  \ and Bobby Sands mural- as a South African, Tata Madiba is a hero to most of us\
  \ and we are well aware of his impact on citizens all around the world. It is always\
  \ a pleasant surprise to see a local idol\u2019s appreciation, particularly half\
  \ a world away. This particular part of Derry is famed for the wrong reasons, most\
  \ well-known, the massacre that occurred on January 30th, 1972- Bloody Sunday. To\
  \ the younger generation, 1972 seems like a lifetime ago but to the vast majority\
  \ of the people still living in the city, it is an integral moment within their\
  \ lifetime. It\u2019s an odd feeling to stand there- you are aware of the pain endured\
  \ but it\u2019s almost a whisper that comes from the wall to tell you not to linger\
  \ in the past but to move on. \n\nI found you, Derry, to also be a landmark for\
  \ the modern world with an incredible and rich culture. Music, dance and comedy\
  \ is a trademark of Northern Ireland and the heart of which can be found within\
  \ this city. It may not be the Paris, the London or the New York of the world but\
  \ Derry has a sense of enigma that immediately draws you in. From the street art\
  \ all around you to the busker on the corner singing the soundtrack to your adventure,\
  \ Derry is full of hidden surprises and is an equal amongst the global \u201Cbig\
  \ player\u201D cities when it comes to enriching your soul.\n\nIt's a combination\
  \ of the heartache and resilience in moving on that drew me to you. You were an\
  \ inspiration in the shape of a tour guide to remind one never to forget the past\
  \ but always move towards the future. You were a lesson that no matter how diverse\
  \ our cultures can be, anywhere across the globe, we can be empathetic and reminded\
  \ that together, we can overcome troubles. You were a look into the future that\
  \ by sharing the little  things we enjoy, culturally, we can become one.\n\nDearest\
  \ Derry, overall you were a treat and my wish is for everyone to experience your\
  \ delight.\nYours sincerely,\nA fellow global citizen."
