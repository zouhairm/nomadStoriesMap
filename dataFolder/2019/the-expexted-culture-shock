Text: "A unique blend of folk-like Polynesisan and of Melanesian and rhythms danced\
  \ on our eardrums. As we turned the corner towards Visa and Immigration, we saw\
  \ three Fijian men in boldly coloured, floral printed shirts playing a sweet, dull\
  \ melody on a ukulele and guitars. We clapped, smiled and danced along to their\
  \ melody, copying their soft sways. \n\n\u201CTwo Lyca Sim Cards, for 2 Fijian Dollar\u201D\
  , a man hollered as we left the airport. Bizarrely, the smell of fried coconut,\
  \ boiling yam and leaking petrol made me feel at home.   \n\nThere was no more time\
  \ to be gallivanting on the city streets, I and the other volunteers had a purpose:\
  \ to empower young Fijian children to believe in themselves and their abilities.\
  \ Aboard a rickety minibus, we travelled 90 miles south of the capital city to The\
  \ Village of Noko Noko.  \n\"Bula, bula!\" the villagers frantically called at us.\
  \ Evidently, eagerly expecting our arrival. Trying to get a glimpse of us through\
  \ the brown tinted windows of the minibus. For all of them, it was their first time\
  \ encountering a Cavalangi (foreign person), there was excitement and anticipation\
  \ brimming in their eyes. They were waving palms and bearing gifts for us. A royal\
  \ reception. The villagers placed garlands of crimson Tagimoucia flowers around\
  \ our necks.                        \n                                         \
  \                                           \n20 brightly coloured tin homes were\
  \ scattered across the village on a backdrop of colossal cliffs and pretty palm\
  \ trees. The aroma of sweet fried dumplings filled the air. Despite the quirky and\
  \ inviting appearance of the Noko Noko, the village had a lot of wear and tear from\
  \ the category 5 tropical cyclone Winston, the Church stood windowless and the once\
  \ proud standing Community Hall, almost flattened. \n\nWe were ushered into the\
  \ chief\u2019s home, where we were invited to a drinking ceremony, Grog.  The tranquillizing,\
  \ non-alcoholic grog-fluid numbed the lips and tickled the tongue. An acquired taste,\
  \ that I was not sure I could ever get used too, made from the residue of the Piper\
  \ methysticum plant. The sharing of the Grog was to help bind the community together\
  \ and that is exactly what it did.\n\nIt was at Nawngwavesi Primary School that\
  \ the journey really began, I had the privilege of meeting the most precious Fijian\
  \ students, Apatia, Mele, Salabogi and Tanoa. The teacher pointed them out to be\
  \ the \u2018weaker\u2019 members of the class. The children and I worked together\
  \ to find alternative methods to help them grapple with the curriculum content.\
  \ Over the weeks, these children grew in confidence and ability, it was almost miraculous\
  \ to witness. Mele, who initially struggled to recognise some letters of the alphabet\
  \ at the beginning of the project was able to read the guided reading book fluently\
  \ by the end of the project. There were children in the class group who initially\
  \ could not add, however at the end of the placement, they were dividing numbers\
  \ up to 30. The Fijian children\u2019s strength, dedication and unrelenting perseverance\
  \ to learn were so inspiring to see. \n\nUpon departure, we were ushered into the\
  \ chief\u2019s home, for our final Grog drinking ceremony.  Once again, the numbing\
  \ feeling of the lips and tickling sensation on the tongue the taste of Grog I had\
  \ become accustomed to and even began to enjoy was never to be tasted again."
