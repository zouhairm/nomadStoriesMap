Text: "This is about my first visit to Bhutan in 2010. Previously I knew nothing about\
  \ this place at the foot of Himalaya. Then I met a Bhutanese during an event in\
  \ Nara, Japan, who gave me information about a seminar to be held in Thimphu, the\
  \ capital city of Bhutan. That was the first time I heard about it. But when I at\
  \ last visited it  for the first time, it was an unforgettable experience. Bhutan\
  \ is a small, peaceful, and tranquil country. Buddhism, which is the religion of\
  \ 99 percent of its people, might have been one of the causes. \nThere is no direct\
  \ flight to Bhutan from Indonesia. I had to transit in Bangkok or Kathmandu, and\
  \ I chose Bangkok. I had to spend the night in Bangkok because the flight to Bhutan\
  \ was at eight in the morning. The Internatinal Airport of Bhutan is in Paro, about\
  \ one hour from Thimphu. It is one of the airports with the most dangerous runway\
  \ because it is surrounded by high Himalayan Mountains. Only pilots with special\
  \ certificates that can fly airplanes from and to Paro. \nThe participants stayed\
  \ for one night in Paro. The next day we visited the Tiger Nest Monastery on the\
  \ cliff of the upper Paro Valley. The monastery, which is the cultural icon of Bhutan,\
  \ is located 10 kilometres to the north Paro and hangs on a precarious cliff at\
  \ 3,120 metres, about 900 metres above the\_Paro valley. The slopes are very steep\
  \ (almost vertical) and the monastery buildings are built into the rock face. Near\
  \ the beginning of the trail is a water-powered prayer wheel, set in motion by a\
  \ flowing stream.\nThe participants went through a pine forest to the monastery.\
  \ Fighting against cold, high altitude, and narrow path, I tried to follow. A tour\
  \ guide helped me, who was breathless due to thin and freezing air. However, my\
  \ fright of height made me gives up, which was of course very unfortunate. It was\
  \ December, the winter season, with a temperature of 10o \u2013 14o Celcius and\
  \ can drop to 1o Celcius at night, which was harsh for me who live in the tropics.\
  \ Once I forgot to wear the inner warmer when we went to a caf\xE9 with bad heater.\
  \ So I shivered all night. But winter makes the sky bright and clear. At night the\
  \ stars shine with no shade of pollution, and during the day the sky is blue with\
  \ no cloud. But winter also makes the plants leafless and the Mountains are brown\
  \ instead of green.\nThere are many interesting things here. First, tobacco is not\
  \ allowed to enter Bhutan. My friend had to surrender his cigarettes at the Paro\
  \ customs. The use of plastic is also very limited. At a store, I was given a cloth\
  \ bag. Although it is a small country, Bhutan is modern in important things. \n\
  Bhutan is a monarch with a king as its ruler and a prime minister to head the government.\
  \ King Jigme Singhye Wangchuk, the previous king, issued the Gross National Happiness\
  \ (GNH), which is interesting. While many developing countries focused on economic\
  \ progress, Bhutan is focused on its people\u2019s happiness.  GNH is valuing collective\
  \ happiness as the goal of governance, by emphasizing harmony with nature and traditional\
  \ values as expressed in the 4 pillars of GNH.The four pillars of GNH's are: 1)\_\
  sustainable\_and\_equitable\_socio-economic development; 2)\_environmental conservation;\
  \ 3) preservation and promotion of culture; and 4) good governance. Limiting the\
  \ use of plastic and tobacco are among the implementations of GNH in daily life.\
  \ \nMy first experience in Bhutan really impressed me, because it was like being\
  \ in a place that I have never imagined before, with geographical features, climate,\
  \ and people that are different from my own country. Bhutan also has a unique policy\
  \ that makes it special compared to the other countries that I visited thus far.\
  \ I felt like I have visited the Shangri-la at the foot of the Himalayas."
