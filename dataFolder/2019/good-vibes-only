Text: "Delayed flight \u2013 probably the last thing you need when you are about to\
  \ start the first leg of your solo backpacking journey through Europe but looking\
  \ back on this moment now, if I hadn\u2019t gone through what I went through that\
  \ night then this story wouldn\u2019t be half as interesting. \nAs I waved goodbye\
  \ to my best friend at Heathrow Airport (and after waiting patiently for my delayed\
  \ flight), I couldn\u2019t help but feel anxious about jumping on a plane to an\
  \ unknown country.  There were so many questions that were going through my head\
  \ like: \n\u2022\tHow am I going to get from San Sebastian Airport to my hostel?\
  \  \n\u2022\tDo the locals speak English?  \n\u2022\tShould I buy some data so I\
  \ can use my Google Maps just in case I get lost?  \nAll of these were very important\
  \ questions and unfortunately, the answers weren\u2019t quite what I thought I would\
  \ have wanted to hear.  \nAs I landed in Madrid Airport (with what I thought was\
  \ only an hour to get from the incoming flight to Madrid to the connecting flight\
  \ to San Sebastian) my jaw dropped, my eyes started to water and somehow, steam\
  \ started blowing from my ears when I realised my connecting flight too was being\
  \ delayed another hour.  Would an extra 2 hours being added to my journey really\
  \ be that much of an issue on a Sunday night?  The answer is yes. \nThe plane finally\
  \ lands in San Sebastian at 9.30pm and I go to the baggage claim area and collect\
  \ my backpack which is a 70L Kathmandu bag weighing at about 15kgs.  I start heading\
  \ towards the taxi stand only to realise, there are no taxis at this time of night\
  \ and Sundays in Spain (and other parts of Europe) are not usually worked by the\
  \ locals.  Thankfully there was two American guys who happened to speak English\
  \ and tell me that apparently there is only 1 bus working that takes passengers\
  \ from the Airport to other parts of San Sebastian which is totally cool, but I\
  \ had no idea where I was going, just the name of my hostel. \nI decide to jump\
  \ on the bandwagon (or I guess in this case, the bus wagon) and take the journey\
  \ into the unknown city of San Sebastian in Spain.  Looking out the window I notice\
  \ nothing at all is open and no cars are driving around.  I can\u2019t seem to spot\
  \ any taxis either and for all I knew, I could have been going the complete opposite\
  \ way to where the hostel was based.  \nI sat on the bus for about 40 minutes and\
  \ got off when the two Americans jumped off.  I kindly asked them if their Google\
  \ Maps or data worked so that I could find where the hostel was but unfortunately,\
  \ they too didn\u2019t have data.  The only thing left to do was walk. \nI want\
  \ you to take this moment to use your imagination.  I am a short, 5 ft 2 girl with\
  \ a 70L backpack (which is about over half my size), roaming the streets of San\
  \ Sebastian after 10.00pm on a Sunday night with zero solo-traveller experience.\
  \  Anxiety levels at this point are reaching an all-time high and breathing techniques\
  \ being used to an absolute maximum.  \nLuckily, after about 20 minutes of walking,\
  \ I finally see a taxi dropping someone off.  I ran across the road and knocked\
  \ on his window, using both my hands to beg him, hoping the international hand gesture\
  \ would not be mistaken for anything other than \u201Cplease\u201D.  He looks at\
  \ his watch and then looks back at my me and nods to say \u201Cyes\u201D.  I am\
  \ so happy I could cry!\nBoth of us not knowing each other\u2019s language, I show\
  \ him the name of my hostel (which I had printed on a schedule I made for myself)\
  \ and he starts driving me only which only felt like 10 minutes down the road. \
  \ I pay and thank him in Spanish.  I walk in the door of my hostel and look up to\
  \ a sign on the wall which said \u201CGood Vibes Only\u201D and I knew I needed\
  \ to leave my attitude at the door."
