Text: "During my life I have never been in the mountains. And I never flew on airplanes,\
  \ until one day the fate threw me into Bulgaria.\nIt was the fall, the very end\
  \ of September. The weather in my hometown could not please the sun, and my girlfriend\
  \ and I wanted to go to the sea. We spent the summer separately: I was in Belgium,\
  \ she was in the south of Russia, and therefore, without a doubt, we took the opportunity\
  \ to book cheap flights from Riga to Burgas.\nOnce came to the town, we rented a\
  \ car to explore the coast. The beauty of the coastal town that opened from the\
  \ height of the serpentine was fascinating, and the blue of the endless sea was\
  \ enveloped in a thin salty blanket brought by the wind to the top of little-known\
  \ capes. We liked being near sea waves and sandy beaches, but we wanted to see the\
  \ Rila Lakes. We left at dawn on the first day of the weekend. A small blue car\
  \ on a diesel engine accelerated to 180 kilometers per hour without any problems,\
  \ so we quickly got to the desired lake complex.\nWe arrived at rush hour, as the\
  \ rows of cars, closely parked on both sides of the road leading to the lift, spoke\
  \ about. The movement was regulated by a special worker in a yellow uniform. We\
  \ left the car in the shade and climbed to the lowest point of the complex, where\
  \ there was a small gray brick building with an \u201CInformation\u201D badge and\
  \ a point of tickets sale. Lifting up we surely did photos but only a couple - it\
  \ was unforgivable to miss such a scene!\nThe lift took us to a height of 2115 meters.\
  \ There were several hours in stock, the sun was shining brightly. Having looked\
  \ at the map, we began to climb the hill to the right instead of descending into\
  \ the valley of the bush that loomed ahead. The first 100 meters were not easy -\
  \ it was terribly hot going under the sun and the prospect of finding a drop of\
  \ shade was nowhere. However, the torment quickly gave way to delight when we saw\
  \ the first three lakes of the seven. One of them was far below us, from the other\
  \ one could only see a puddle, and the third was like a shamrock. Checked the height\
  \ - 2220 meters.\nLater we came across a lake in the shape of a kidney with rather\
  \ steep shores, twin-lake with two identical halves divided by a strait, and a lake\
  \ in the shape of an eye (as viewed from above). With each new discovery, we climbed\
  \ higher and higher until we finally reached the last point - 2640 meters. From\
  \ the edge of the mountain one could see absolutely everything - the lakes down\
  \ below, the hotel near the ski lift, the ways on horseback in the distance. The\
  \ bright blue horizon was eroding, it was so far visible.\nOn the other side, just\
  \ a few meters below, the waters of the Lake Tear sparkled in the sun. \u201CThey\
  \ tell the water in it is so clean that at every point you can see the bottom,\u201D\
  \ my girlfriend told me. I wanted to check whether this is true, and therefore I\
  \ threw a pebble into the water. It quickly went to the bottom, and it seemed to\
  \ me that the depth of the lake was no more than a meter.\nBut I was wrong. The\
  \ average depth of Tears is 4.5 meters, and my pebble plunged to a depth of about\
  \ three. I was fascinated by how clear the ice water is.\nI lost in thought. I wondered\
  \ when these lakes appeared, whether they were connected to each other and who opened\
  \ them first. I think I was close to a solution when suddenly a loud voice came\
  \ to my mind: \u201CWe have an hour before the lift closes, it's time to go!\u201D\
  \nWe returned with jackets in hand. I got into the car and went down the serpentine\
  \ against my own desires. The light fog began to fall on the road hiding behind\
  \ the secret of the Rila Lakes."
