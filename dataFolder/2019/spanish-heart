Text: "Late July to September in Europe is usually when the locals travel elsewhere,\
  \ but it\u2019s also the time when elsewhere arrives in Europe. \n\tI\u2019d just\
  \ come from Madrid, and it was beautiful, but Barcelona had this\u2013 familiarity\
  \ of a past life mixed with the complexity of modern civilization. I fell instantly\
  \ in love with Barcelona. A unique city where you can relax in your scenic surroundings,\
  \ or fling yourself instantly into a vibrant crowd of people and roam free. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find myself naturally engaging with the people and culture. Though it\u2019\
  s no surprise, since it\u2019s a city where human interaction and common curtesy\
  \ is not a lost concept\u2026 except maybe with the taxi drivers. I spent my limited\
  \ days on foot, up and down the cobblestoned streets, which was easily a cake-walk\
  \ in my Birkenstocks. Downtown, in the heart of Barcelona, there is a famous street\
  \ called \u201CLas Ramblas.\u201D There were street vendors, many selling common\
  \ tourist trinkets, but nonetheless, treasures to bring back home to gaze and reminisce.\
  \ Suddenly, I noticed a crowd pushed to the side of the building behind a peddler's\
  \ tent. The music drawing them in as it did to me. The closest I can compare the\
  \ sound to was a combination of salsa, cumbia, and folk music. The musicians launched\
  \ the tempo, but the people joined in, swaying their hips, until one older woman\
  \ \u2013 a professional dancer in her youth I suspect, stole the show. \n\tIf you\
  \ ever visit Barcelona, you will be in awe of numerous things, but above all its\
  \ agriculture. Antoni Gaudi contributed his artistic vision for the construction\
  \ of this colorful city. His legacy lives in the Parque G\xFCill, and the unfinished\
  \ notorious Sagrada Fam\xEDlia. Walking through this beautiful sanctuary is a once\
  \ in a lifetime experience alone. Pictures simply do not capture the entirety of\
  \ these moments. \n\tIn the evening [and their evenings are, in fact, practically\
  \ bedtime hours], I found myself at the beach. A glistening seashore guarded by\
  \ powdery sand right up against the banked sidewalk. On the right side was a straight\
  \ row of nightclubs only a few kilometers away from the beach, forming a path to\
  \ the hotels and towers. Facing the ocean on the left side was a market of restaurants,\
  \ and bars. They all advertised their individual seafood paella to tourists, which\
  \ is what Barcelona is known for, like the Spanish are known for their \u201CSangria.\u201D\
  \ The Sangria was the perfect balance of fruit and alcohol; either a refreshing\
  \ beverage, or a complementary cocktail for a meal. Locals don\u2019t drink sangria\
  \ often though, tourists do, so it begs the question if their culturally known cuisine\
  \ is even a part of their weekly meals. Spaniards, like Mexicans, would not eat\
  \ an entire course meal like Paella for dinner because they believe it wouldn\u2019\
  t digest well. All that rice during those late hours. However, superstitious beliefs\
  \ do not pertain to visitors, a.k.a me. \u201CLa Fonda Del Port Olimpic\u201D was\
  \ the restaurant where I settled and ate; salad topped with fresh tuna, soft bread,\
  \ fried potatoes, seasoned claims, and the last, most delicious part, seafood paella.\
  \ I devoured everything contentedly with the help of bottomless sangrias.  \n \t\
  In the darkness, I\u2019d never seen so many lights, even for a city; lamp-posts\
  \ towering over one another as if they were competing for the honor to light the\
  \ streets. I had no reason not to wander around. You don\u2019t need to find reasons\
  \ to stroll the sidewalks, within the day or the evening, because you\u2019ll enjoy\
  \ every hidden corner Barcelona has to offer. I never expected anything from this\
  \ city, but it showed me everything. Barcelona really is an amazing city for any\
  \ traveler to immerse themselves into."
