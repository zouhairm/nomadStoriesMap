Text: "Lunches in our university in Ha Noi invariably occur in one place. It is a\
  \ small, gray alley, that twists and turns, and where the sunlight is hardly ever\
  \ present. As you walk into the alley, countless shops meander amid darkness, packed\
  \ with all sorts of trinkets and objects aging away in their dusty shelves, overlooking\
  \ an always busy world full of hot dishes and customers who live and leave in a\
  \ hurry. The landscape is governed by the ubiquitous plastic tables and chairs,\
  \ graciously colorful and of the size you would find in a kindergarten, where students\
  \ settle in a precarious balance with the backpack on one side and a deep bowl of\
  \ steaming rice in their hands, eating with speed to return to class. The pace in\
  \ the alley is frantic, the smoke rises thickly from the fires on the sidewalk,\
  \ where huge pots of chicken broth and other concoctions are heated. This is our\
  \ lunch spot, and we love it. \nAmong the simplest gastronomic options is the noble\
  \ bao. The bao is a kind of dough pocket, spongier than an empanada or a pasha borek,\
  \ and steamed. It can contain pork, chicken, mushrooms. It is eaten at all times,\
  \ and there is even a version to eat at breakfast: it comes without filling and\
  \ is swallowed in one brave gulp with a bit of soy sauce. The lady who sells our\
  \ daily baos laughs every time we try to say \"mot bao chung\" (\"a vegetarian bao\"\
  ). While she spins her baos with a pair of rusty metal tweezers demonstrating an\
  \ agility and fine motor skills that her fragile figure wouldn\u2019t allow to suspect,\
  \ she yells and smiles, displaying her very black teeth. Not so long ago, women\
  \ in Viet Nam dyed their teeth black to indicate that they were entering adulthood.\
  \ In rural areas the great majority of older women have their teeth stained completely\
  \ black, and this ritual of passage was and is absolutely central. In the cities\
  \ of today, the custom no longer thrives among the young, and the Hanoians in particular\
  \ might be considered traditional but they have also grown up in the shadow of Colgate\
  \ advertisements and prefer a rather pearly smile. Since \u0110\u1ED5i M\u1EDBi,\
  \ the great opening of 1986 that connected this socialist republic with the global\
  \ market, the big brands and their advertisements dominate part of the Vietnamese\
  \ aspirational imaginary.\nThe \u0110\u1ED5i M\u1EDBi literally means \"renewal\"\
  \ or \"reconstruction\", and it is an economic philosophy that Vietnam adopted in\
  \ recent times. Like other Asian nations, Vietnam has a communist past: the government\
  \ directly controlled the country's economy, even regulating private companies legally\
  \ and economically. This resulted in very limited trade with foreign countries,\
  \ and production within Vietnam - from big companies to farms - was often inefficiently\
  \ controlled by the government through a grisly bureaucracy. The \u0110\u1ED5i M\u1EDB\
  i, as conceived and presented by the Vietnamese, was simply intended to sustain\
  \ the existence of the communist nation. However, it also aims to make the nation's\
  \ economy a part of the global market and introduce what they call \"the pleasant\
  \ parts of capitalism.\" This approach is similar to that adopted in China and other\
  \ ex-communist nations, but Vietnam has been busy building the \u0110\u1ED5i M\u1EDB\
  i on its own terms. Today the Vietnamese say that the country is \"socialist with\
  \ some capitalism\", which is visible in the Gucci or Dr. Martens stores that coexist\
  \ without apparent contradiction amongst street vendors, traditional markets, and\
  \ communist paraphernalia.\nChewing through a bao that I pay for with a 10,000 VND\
  \ bill where the face of Ho Chi Minh shines serenely, I think of the places where\
  \ we can see how history is interwoven with the present. I wonder what Uncle Ho\
  \ would say about the Lays fries that are now sold in combo with the purchase of\
  \ two baos and a Coca Cola in this gray alley of Hanoi. The bell rings, the old\
  \ lady tilts her head up anticipating the chaos: the bowls are abruptly dropped,\
  \ several chopsticks fall to the floor. With a symphony of screaming and dragging\
  \ of plastic chairs the student horde of the alley leaves, leaving a dusty cloud\
  \ of silence floating in the air."
