Text: "The last thing I expected to find myself doing in Hong Kong was going snorkelling.\
  \ \n\nA friend of mine from Vancouver was visiting Hong Kong as well. We were trying\
  \ to figure out what to do, and we recently learnt that Hong Kong has beautiful\
  \ nature landscapes when we went on a hike at Dragon's Back. I stumbled upon Hoi\
  \ Ha on an internet search, a quaint sea-side village. It was known for its pristine,\
  \ undisturbed natural scenery and for also being a snorkelling hub. I messaged a\
  \ bunch of my local friends to inquire about it, and not only had they never heard\
  \ of Hoi Ha, but they thought we were crazy for wanting to snorkel in Hong Kong.\
  \ Crazy or not, we thought we'd go scout it out. \n\nTwo hours on transit and we\
  \ finally arrived, only to find ourselves stuck in a downpour of rain. We were soaked\
  \ without even entering the water. Jennifer and I decided to wait it out so we could\
  \ experience what it's like snorkelling in Hong Kong, and we ended up making a few\
  \ friends who were waiting to go in for a dive as well. We all waited under a bunch\
  \ of umbrella's near a small shop, which sold diving equipment. The shop-owner's\
  \ grandson kept teasing us when we complained about the rain, but he nonetheless\
  \ helped us translate whenever we needed any supplies from his grandparents. \n\n\
  The rain finally cleared after an hour of waiting. We gathered our supplies, and\
  \ headed into the water. The area was largely uncrowded, and those who were there\
  \ ranged from experienced divers to first-time snorkelers (like my friend). First\
  \ glance into the water and it was beautiful - filled with tropical, colourful fish.\
  \ The water was a bit murky because of the rain. I almost swam into what I believe\
  \ was a lion's mane jellyfish because of that, and thankfully I saw it just in time\
  \ to stop. We snorkelled for about an hour before it started to rain again, and\
  \ we had to head back to the shore. Jennifer and I thought we'd wait it out a bit\
  \ more to see if the rain stopped, but it didn't. \n\nNonetheless, we had an amazing\
  \ time exploring the natural beauty that Hong Kong had to offer. The long trek to\
  \ Hoi Ha was worth it, because not only did we unearth a hidden gem, we also made\
  \ connections that lasted us throughout the rest of our trip. Hong Kong is a multi-faceted\
  \ part of the world where urban, non-urban, and natural spaces coexist with one\
  \ another. Jennifer and I both to this day talk about returning to explore it once\
  \ more."
