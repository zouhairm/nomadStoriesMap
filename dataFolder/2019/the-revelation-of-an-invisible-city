Text: "I was there, in the middle of the sea, a boat was protecting me from sinking\
  \ in the water. It was all fog around me, no visible figures, no blue sky, no sounds,\
  \ my senses were all shutted down by my surroundings. I felt threatened by the feeling\
  \ of lonelyness that penetrated my body. Suddenly, as I was there in the middle\
  \ of nowhere looking at the horizon something started to appear, I was able to distinguish\
  \ different shapes: a tower, a dome, rooftops and all together drew the horizon\
  \ of the place to be discovered.\n\n\"We have arrived to Venezzia\", said the navigator\
  \ of the boat. I stepped out of the boat and in the deck of the island. I was no\
  \ longer in constant motion as I was for so long in the boat, finally I was responsible\
  \ for my movements again. I was directed to a place were they sold souveniers from\
  \ the country and the city. I glanced at those objects and noticed their singularity.\
  \ Italy, the third country I visited on that trip after being amazed by the Eiffel\
  \ Tower, in France and the Swiss Alps in Switzerland, had a bigger challenge in\
  \ making me impress. \n\nAfter traveling in a boat surrounded by fog in total silence,\
  \ the voices of the people surrounding me became much more noticeable. Although\
  \ I tried to understand their languaje, their gestures and tone made me feel like\
  \ an outsider,  like a person who enters a museum full of pieces of art and is only\
  \ meant to observe and appreciate the color, the message, the tecnique.\n\nMy sense\
  \ of sight intensified as I entered \"Piazza San Marco\", the proportions of this\
  \ place were overwhelming. An empty place where only a tall brick tower raises as\
  \ a symbol of importance. In front of it, San Marcos Church. A great architectural\
  \ piece where the depth and colors of the facade make you wonder about its inside.\
  \ \n\nI understood the purpose of the boat traveling. The city was kilometers away,\
  \ in that distance the visitor had the necessary time to shut down his senses to\
  \ listen to his heart beat and prepare his eyes for the surprise gathered in one\
  \ island.  Cities nowadays tend to overwhelm us with big lighted posters, \nVenice,\
  \ changes the whole perspective. Its identity becomes the lighthouse of the city\
  \ making it a place from which you are unable to leave without wanting to come back"
