Text: "A string of cruel and vindictive cold sores sweeps across my lower lip, threatening\
  \ to split open with the slightest of smiles. They are deeply inconvenient to my\
  \ arrival in a foreign land. My instinctual need to smile is strong, almost pathological,\
  \ it is my way of showing how grateful and joyous I am to be here. I'm trapped between\
  \ the physical pain if I do smile, and excruciating cognitive pain if I don\u2019\
  t. \n\nFrom this mist of horror the form of Ivana appears; the women who will become\
  \ my local insider, my cultural guide to the Czech Republic. As an Australian doing\
  \ things at the last minute, I\u2019d put a message on the internet looking for\
  \ a flat to rent in Prague (like, from this weekend if possible?). Ivana had ventured\
  \ a reply, having lived in Australia for a while she had a fondness for Aussies.\n\
  \nOver hot chocolate in a Swiss themed pub our chatter weaved through the realms\
  \ of our odd cultural overlap. She asked why Australians love small talk so much,\
  \ but I couldn\u2019t pluck an answer from my thoughts. I asked why trying to order\
  \ tap water at cafes kept getting me strange looks and expensive bottled water.\
  \ It turns out this is a trigger for a lot of locals, and her heated reply included\
  \ the possibility of a Water Lobby that intimidates restaurants. Soon Ivana had\
  \ me reeling off what I\u2019d learnt of the Czech language, jabbering away I quickly\
  \ got to the classic phrase every English speaker translates into their new language\
  \ - how are you? In Czech - jak se mas \u030C?  Quiet a serious look took hold of\
  \ her face, \u2018that\u2019s a very private question is Czech\u2019. \n\nI was\
  \ baffled, her expression told me this concept was too distant from Australian small\
  \ talk for me to comprehend straight away. She explained that it\u2019s answered\
  \ in honesty, and at length, with a list of at least five things going badly in\
  \ one\u2019s life. The literal translation between the languages had seemed so routine,\
  \ but culturally they were unrecognisable. Ivana told me when she\u2019d arrived\
  \ in Australia, she\u2019d been overwhelmed by the kindness of people asking her\
  \ so often, how are you? But slowly it grew into a cage of frustration, she wanted\
  \ to list her five current woes but discovered in Australia this was not how the\
  \ conversation worked. People would even say \u2018how are you?\u2019 then walk\
  \ off or keep talking without even allowing a space to reply. She said this was\
  \ particularly devastating. My soul shriveled and hid, I did this exact thing all\
  \ the time back home. \n\nMy position was clearly dire: no smiling or asking \u2018\
  how are you?\u2019. My go-to tools for making a good first impression now total\
  \ duds. I needed to shift my idea of polite behaviour and it was going to be wildly\
  \ uncomfortable. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me I\u2019d need to learn my own culture\
  \ before I could engage with a new one, and it rolled out ahead of me as a gauntlet,\
  \ demanding I pick myself apart and rebuild my habits, my sense of self. \n\nPublic\
  \ politeness in any culture often feels aligned, on some level, with acting like\
  \ everything is ok. In Australia, I began to realise, there\u2019s an expectation\
  \ to be polite by actively acting out your ok-ness. But for the Czech\u2019s, politeness\
  \ is more reserved, more aligned with being not un-ok. The cold sores forced me\
  \ to depress my smile and its symbol of overt Aussie ok-ness, reforming into a gentler,\
  \ not un-ok expression. The phrase \u2018how are you?\u2019, a keystone of polite\
  \ ok-ness and small talk back home, shifted into a powerful counterpart to public\
  \ politeness, a Czech portal into personal space where honesty and lists of grievances\
  \ could run free. \n\nWith Ivana as my cultural guide, and the behavioural conditioning\
  \ being dealt out by my cold sores, the edges of my own cultural behaviour were\
  \ starting to reveal themselves, making it possible to melt them and merge with\
  \ this new Czech world. Ivana had given me a footing from which I could start reforming,\
  \ and a strange new pigeon language in cultural fluency was beginning to taking\
  \ shape."
