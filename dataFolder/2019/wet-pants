Text: "The tension is becoming unbearable. Painful even. I am walking in one of the\
  \ back streets of Lisbon's Baixa Chiado. Camera in hand, eyes wide open and i have\
  \ to pee. Badly. Using a wall or a tree is not really my thing and besides that,\
  \ I am also looking for a place to have lunch. Where else than in Baixa? With so\
  \ many restaurantes, tascas and tascinhas, it should be easy to find a spot. No.\
  \ It's lunch hour in tourist season and finding a free table is simply impossible.\
  \ A detail on the wall of an eighteenth century building draws my attention and\
  \ I point my camera. Focus, lower ISO and up the F-stops. Click. The moment I'm\
  \ done taking the shot, I feel my bladder again. It's screaming.\n\nA small restaurant\
  \ on the right side of the street. Noisy glasses, cutlery and plates mixing with\
  \ the sound of people talking and laughing. A waiter, probably the owner, is running\
  \ back and forth between the kitchen, the bar and the tables. Smiling seriously.\
  \ These are days that the money is rolling in. It will be over sooner than he wants.\n\
  \nI try to get his attention. A table is what I want and to use the toilet. He makes\
  \ a gesture that seems to be a mix between `just wait\xB4 and `go away, don't bother\
  \ me\xB4 and I can no longer hold it.\n\nWith all the muscles in my abdomen tensed\
  \ to the max, I walk into his tiny restaurant. In the back a small door leads to\
  \ a broken toilet. Broken, because most of Portugal's toilets are. I enter and,\
  \ while one hand frantically tries to open my zipper I lean against the door. Before\
  \ I can take out my penis, I hear loud voices behind me. Someone is pushing against\
  \ the door. At that time, I'm trying very hard to not pee my knickers while protecting\
  \ my camera against the assault.\n\nShouting, `customers only\xB4 ... banging, pushing,\
  \ a hand reaching into the stall and grabbing my shoulder. How can I explain that\
  \ I want to be his customer and I will gladly pay for more than he has to offer?\
  \ I do speak his language, but he hates the mouths he feeds and does not want to\
  \ hear. I try to explain, but it's useles. I give up.\n\nUnder the eyes of the mostly\
  \ Portuguese clientele, the owner and his wife push me out of the restaurant. What\
  \ else can I do than laugh?\n\nFor a few moments my body seems to have forgotten\
  \ its urge to relieve. I shake my head, ignore the looks of people passing and move\
  \ away from the restaurant. Behind me the owner shouts something about stupid foreigners.\
  \ Successfully, I fight the urge to raise my finger. Twenty meters in front of me,\
  \ a man covered in plastic is digging in a rubbish container. One of the many homeless\
  \ that roam the streets of this successful tourist attraction called Lisbon. I freeze.\
  \ Suddenly, a calm sadness falls over me as I create the frame in my mind. Without\
  \ thinking, I raise the camera and focus.\n\nWhile my finger presses the button,\
  \ I feel the warm pee flow down my left leg. And it is of no consequence, because\
  \ I know that I have just made the best photo of the day."
