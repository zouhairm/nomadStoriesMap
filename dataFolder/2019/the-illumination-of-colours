Text: "Does life have as many colours as You can notice?\nWhen I approached the side\
  \ of the bridge, a chilly March air coming from Seine pinched my face. There I was\
  \ finally in my ideal Paris. You can say that statement is a clich\xE9 but that\u2019\
  s a thing about classical places \u2013 they remain their beauty and elegance as\
  \ they are somewhere above the ordinary life, creating some majestic sphere for\
  \ those who understand it\u2019s spirit. I have always a feeling that I would find\
  \ myself in that city rather than just worshipping it from afar. And so I did. \n\
  At least, cold breeze was keeping me awake after a sleepless night on the road.\
  \ I was ready to walk the streets and let parisian townhouses surround me. They\
  \ were proudly revealing their dignity while I was passing them. Actually, I almost\
  \ felt ashamed with a simple scarf wrapped around my neck and a random jacket on.\
  \ I wished I had matched them more.\nMy first encounter with Paris happened around\
  \ the \xCEle de la Cit\xE9 - facing the monuments that I had already known so well.\
  \ I was prepared for those meetings. It was more about finding out if they would\
  \ live up to my expectations as I wanted them to. \nThe trip was pre-organised and\
  \ consisted of a complex scheadule with little free time for exploration. After\
  \ hours of checking off planned points, I had to choose between having some personal\
  \ time or going for additional payed trip to the Sainte-Chapelle. As a matter of\
  \ fact I hadn\u2019t heard about that one before. I decided to go despite my fatique.\
  \ Anywhere I go I always have a feeling that I want to take advantage of every single\
  \ minute in order not to regret wasting my time in that place I had travelled to.\
  \ Most of my companions had chosen shopping and eating, so I went forward with only\
  \ a small group of people.\nThe space we entered remainded me of a crypt \u2013\
  \ it was really small, cold and dark. I was walking around with disappointment as\
  \ I didn\u2019t find anything special about this place in opposition to how highly\
  \ was it recommended to me. I even started doubting if I had made a right decision,\
  \ when I realised that there was another floor. I followed others to the steep stairs\
  \ and began to climb. \nWhen I reached the last step, I lifted up my head and faltered,\
  \ almost falling backwords down the stairs. In that moment the sun released itself\
  \ entirely from the clouds and entered the chapel from every direction. I was surrounded\
  \ by panorama of enormous windows. They were made of stained glass in all the colours\
  \ I could think of. The distinguished one was blue which particular tint I had never\
  \ seen before. I was lost for words \u2013 standing overwhelmed and moving my eyes\
  \ slowly alongside them. Somewhere above me, golden edges of windows ended as arches\
  \ and created a night sky on a ceiling which was covered with hundreds of stars\
  \ painted on it. For the first time I was in thoughtless state of mind with only\
  \ pure admiration, calmness and relief left in my head. \nEvery time when ordinary\
  \ life bothers me, I would close my eyes and stand there back again \u2013 illuminated\
  \ by colours. Blinded with our expectations and trite schemes we can\u2019t see\
  \ them where we are not encouraged to do so. But they are here \u2013 around every\
  \ corner, waiting to be found. The only thing is to abandon your  stereotypes and\
  \ open your willing eyes."
