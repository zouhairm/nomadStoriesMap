Text: "I was at the end of yet another trip throughout India. The monsoon rains had\
  \ arrived in Rishikesh at the base of the Himalayan mountains and rivers rushed\
  \ down the tiny cobbled streets. It was only a one-day bus ride into New Delhi to\
  \ catch the next flight. Long bus rides are usually the downfall of backpacking,\
  \ so I\u2019d pre-booked an AC bus at my hostel and set out at dawn in a rickshaw\
  \ to the major bus hub. \n\nI was greeted by a lot of thirty odd buses and a swarm\
  \ of people. The rains were relentless, I could barely see two metres in front of\
  \ me. I\u2019d spent enough time in India to know that nothing is organised easily,\
  \ there would be no help desk or obvious bus with the correct company name on it,\
  \ so I pulled my ticket out and made my way through the rain, determined to show\
  \ whoever I could my ticket until someone could direct me to the right bus. \n\n\
  Before I had the chance, a young man ran across the lot with an umbrella and asked\
  \ to see my ticket, he turned and yelled something in Hindi I could not understand\
  \ to his friends and they directed me to stand under the tiny flooded shelter and\
  \ wait for a green bus. There I stood with water up to my ankles, shoulder to shoulder\
  \ with locals. While I worried about my laptop and cameras staying dry, I started\
  \ to feel guilty at the size of my bags and the precious space they were taking\
  \ up in the crowded shelter.\n\nMy departure time passed but I wasn\u2019t worried,\
  \ nothing runs on time in India. The shelter began to empty, and I took a seat next\
  \ to a young mother. She gestured for my ticket and in return handed me her baby,\
  \ who stared quietly up at me with a gentle curiosity. Her husband informed us that\
  \ the bus had broken down, it was not coming, we would need to find another way\
  \ into Delhi. \n\nA spark lit in my chest, no longer would this be a simple or easy\
  \ day, it would be a day for adventure. I sat in the rain smiling back at the baby\
  \ in my arms and felt a familiar feeling, one of community. The language barrier\
  \ meant that my new friends and I could only mutter a few words together but none\
  \ of that mattered. An old local bus pulled up in front of us, a steel cage with\
  \ smoke billowing from every crevasse. The men picked up my bags and took them on\
  \ board, the woman took my hand with a smile and led me to the front of bus while\
  \ the men moved to the back as is custom. \n\nThe bus was flooded, and the rains\
  \ were leaking in from almost every window and it would be another twelve hours\
  \ before I reached my destination. I hoped to sleep but the whirlwind of travellers\
  \ jumping on and off the bus captivated me. The local bus held host to families,\
  \ locals moving produce from market to market and the eccentric pilgrims dressed\
  \ only in orange heading towards the holy Ganga River. I had a seat at every table\
  \ when we ate at roadside shacks and I tested my limited knowledge of Hindi whilst\
  \ the word Australia was yelled across meals. \n\nI started the day alone in the\
  \ rain, stranded dreading my long journey but as we drove out of the monsoon and\
  \ into the sprawling metropolis of Delhi, I felt warmth but also a creeping uneasiness\
  \ at returning to Australia, to a place where people are all too consumed in their\
  \ schedules and mobiles. I hugged my friends goodbye and whispered Dhanyavaad the\
  \ Hindi word for thank you and wondered if they would ever know how grateful I was\
  \ for their friendship. As I sat in the terminal at Old Delhi Station under the\
  \ pink sunset, with all my belongings wet, sure that I smelt terrible and a rat\
  \ ran across my feet I smiled at the knowledge that my experience wasn\u2019t extraordinary\
  \ or unique it simply was...India."
