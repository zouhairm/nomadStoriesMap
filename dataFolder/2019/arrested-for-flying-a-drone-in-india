Text: "\u201CCan I come?\u201D I asked the police who looked like a younger Tom Selleck.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHusband?\u201D he asked.\n\n\u201CNo.\u201D\n\n\u201CNo-husband. Okay,\
  \ stay here.\u201D\n\n5 hours ago, at 7:00 am Delhi time, no-husband woke me up\
  \ and said, \u201CTrish, the police is here.\u201D\n\nI immediately dressed up without\
  \ even washing my face to see what\u2019s happening. I hurried because for some\
  \ reasons, I have a feeling that I can solve things with the police but in reality,\
  \ I am that hysterical no-wife.\n\nNo-husband and I stood there, not understanding\
  \ anything while Tom Selleck, two other policemen in light khaki outfits, and our\
  \ 20-something hotel receptionist were arguing. We didn\u2019t understand a thing\
  \ but we knew shit is about to go down.\n\nAll over the hotel, there were signs\
  \ saying \u201Cdroning is not allowed.\u201D The signs were at least two inches\
  \ apart from each other it looked like a wall full of electoral campaign posters\
  \ on top of each other.\n\nOkay, we get it. Droning is not allowed. At least I did.\n\
  \nI don\u2019t talk about no-husband a lot but let me tell you this person is not\
  \ hard-headed but is someone whom you can\u2019t stop if he wants to do something.\
  \ One moment he\u2019s into surfing, another he\u2019s into photography, another\
  \ moment he\u2019s into Interior Designing \u2013 and I GET THAT. I truly do. And\
  \ I honestly love this about him. I have never met a man in my life who\u2019s as\
  \ tenacious as no-husband. Nothing and no one will ever stop him. Not even me. Most\
  \ of the people I know who have this attitude are women.\n\nI was torn between his\
  \ love for what he does and with all measures, to do everything to achieve what\
  \ he wants and his conscious efforts in breaking the rules. I didn\u2019t know what\
  \ to feel. I was feeling bad and proud at the same time.\n\nAll I was thinking was\
  \ no-husband being in an Indian prison. I\u2019m sure you get the picture. I was\
  \ also thinking about teaching him a lesson by not calling my Indian contacts to\
  \ help. I can definitely leave him there a few nights without claiming him because\
  \ no matter what happens, I knew he will get out. I just didn\u2019t know what it\
  \ will cost us. Either way, the only solution I am seeing is money: if they confiscate\
  \ the drone, it\u2019s money for buying a new drone. If they want a bribe, it\u2019\
  s money, too. I don\u2019t know any way out of this but money.\n\nWhile all these\
  \ things are running in my head, they continued to argue. I looked at our 20-something\
  \ receptionist scratching his head. Although I had no idea what he was saying, I\
  \ am sure he was apologizing on no-husband\u2019s behalf. If you didn\u2019t know\
  \ what happened and you look at this scene, you will see that the receptionist looks\
  \ like the culprit \u2013 like he was claiming this was all his fault.\n\nBut clearly,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t. The signs are all over the hotel and it was pretty obvious that\
  \ no-husband was to blame. This made me want to smack no-husband\u2019s head more.\
  \ Someone is being blamed for his wrongdoings and I am not all for that. \n\nTom\
  \ Selleck, his crew, no-husband and 20-something receptionist left for the police\
  \ station and I sat there alone, still thinking of the worst case scenarios there\
  \ is. I called my childhood bestfriend from the Philippines who has contacts in\
  \ India just in case something bad really happens. I am very sure no-husband will\
  \ sit at the police station defenseless because he didn\u2019t speak the language.\
  \ Nobody\u2019s even talking to him because the receptionist takes all the blame.\
  \ My decision to not claim him in case he goes into an Indian cell was still there\
  \ but I still want to know my options.\n\nI waited and waited until I received a\
  \ text from no-husband: \u201CI feel very bad because they are kind of blaming the\
  \ receptionist.\u201D\n\nI felt sadness that slowly turned into horror. Apparently,\
  \ no-husband is sitting there comfortably and drinking chai. I always had the fascination\
  \ with India\u2019s caste system, and through the years, even without planned visits\
  \ to India, I was drawn to read about it."
