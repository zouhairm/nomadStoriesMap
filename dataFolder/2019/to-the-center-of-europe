Text: "It was a one-night decision to seize the opportunity of having our first road\
  \ trip. Christmas, 2017.\nI\u2019d usually spend this particular holiday with my\
  \ parents, but not this time.\nOur starting point is Athens, the capital of Greece.\
  \ The final destination is Prague, the capital of\nCzech Republic.\nWe prepared\
  \ the essential luggage, grabbed our passports and put on our biggest smile. Let\
  \ the\nadventure begin!\n\nTwenty-two people were the companions in our journey,\
  \ plus our guide and the bus driver of\ncourse. One bus, many personalities!\nOne\
  \ group, strangers among strangers at first, but as the time passed, we formed a\
  \ coordinate\nbond. One could argue that this small bus community represents the\
  \ society; a group of\ndifferent ages, habits and opinions.\nThe high average of\
  \ ages was remarkable! Congrats to them! Retired couples with high levels\nof strength\
  \ and durability, like teenagers.\nIt was surprising to see two older women without\
  \ company. An eighty-two-year-old psychologist\nand a middle-aged doctor.\nI genuinely\
  \ admired their courage and spunk to take this trip alone! Despite the (possibly)\
  \ many\ndifferences between us all, everyone shared the will to make it happen.\n\
  Surely our group was not so homogeneous, but this trip connected us. A 4331 km trip\
  \ had just\nbegun.\n\nAs kilometers passed by, we feasted our eyes on one city after\
  \ the other. Road trips give you\nthis unique opportunity to enjoy and discover\
  \ the morphology of every country.\nYou can orientate yourself and have a better\
  \ view of the countries. Unlike a flight, that you can\nprobably compare with more\
  \ of a teleport.\nAs we go through the borders of every country, we notice that\
  \ the landscape alternates; rivers,\nmountains, plains, snowy, foggy, sunny.\nEvery\
  \ country leaves a different taste, memories and feelings. It\u2019s like taking\
  \ an instant photo of\nevery country and keeping those snapshots in our minds. Oh,\
  \ how outstanding that would be.\nYou know what, I will give it a try, briefly.\n\
  At first, FYROM. A black and white photo of Axios river flowing slowly next to the\
  \ main road.\nSerbia; sepia foggy scenery with tiny houses with those incredibly\
  \ snowy triangular roofs.\nA nightlife scene for Budapest, the capital of Hungary.\
  \ Imagine a travel cruise crossing Danube\nwhile listening to Mozart and making\
  \ a wish when passing underneath a bridge.\nIt\u2019s now the turn of Austria, and\
  \ the exceptional Vienna. That was definitely a golden photo of\none of the many\
  \ imposing monumental buildings.\nFinally, a sunset at the Charles Bridge with those\
  \ baroque statues waving goodbye at the sun.\nThat would be a perfect memory from\
  \ Czech Republic's Prague.\n\nFulfilling your dreams is definitely much better than\
  \ dreaming. A dream, maybe a life\u2019s dream,\ncame to the end!\nPromises were\
  \ made among us travelers for a possible next trip. Something we know that will\n\
  never happen, but our enthusiasm and joy were so intense that these words came straight\
  \ from\nour hearts.\nWhile travelling you can see the real face of everyone, so\
  \ it feels like we knew each other for\nyears. 9 days, 26 people, 6 towns, 4331\
  \ km and memories!! Every minute was totally worth it!"
