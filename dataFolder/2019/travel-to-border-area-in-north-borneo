Text: "This trip was started by an introductory study in April-July 2012 through my\
  \ participation in the 2012 Equatorial Expedition activities. This activity allowed\
  \ me to make preliminary observations in Nunukan Regency which at that time was\
  \ still included in the East Kalimantan Province (now officially becoming North\
  \ Kalimantan ) In the activity which lasted for approximately four months, I had\
  \ time to visit the Simanggaris area, Tulin Onsoi, Sebatik, Sebuku, and Lumbis Induk.\
  \ I began to be interested in seeing irregularities that occurred at the border\
  \ while visiting Lumbis Induk. While in the village of Mansalong, I got a lot of\
  \ information about the interaction activities of people at the border. I was curious,\
  \ but unfortunately I had not had the opportunity to arrive at the border zone,\
  \ namely Labang village.\n\_\_\_\_\_Even though I haven't arrived in Labang village,\
  \ I have visited several areas that have cultural activities similar to those in\
  \ the village. These areas are villages in Tulin Onsoi, Sebuku, and Lumbis Induk.\
  \ When I interviewed local residents, they claimed to be 'the local Dayak tribe'\
  \ who used to live in the forests and still wear clothing from finished bark. Men\
  \ form the lead wood to be used as loincloths (gabag) while women form it like a\
  \ skirt. When I asked about the name of this group, some said \u2018Agabag\u2019\
  \ some called menyebut Tegalan \u2019. Generally those who call \u2018Agabag\u2019\
  \ have a position as a local elite.\n\_\_\_\_\_On the second trip, I began to focus\
  \ on discussing the phenomenon of human movement on the country's borders. Labang\
  \ is the main location of my research because the area is closest to the national\
  \ border. I lived in Labang for approximately 2.5 months. When I was in Labang,\
  \ I did not do a lot of in-depth interviews but were more involved in Labang's population\
  \ activities. I only did in-depth interviews with a number of residents such as\
  \ girls, mothers (who certainly could speak a little Indonesian), traditional leaders,\
  \ village heads, and a local elite who lived in Mansalong.\n\_\_\_\_\_I filled the\
  \ days while in Labang by playing in the Sedalir River, watching volleyball, elementary\
  \ school children (SD), playing to the post, taking part in the fields, and taking\
  \ part in searching for durian. Every now and then I also go down to Mansalong to\
  \ buy some daily necessities. During my time at the research location, there have\
  \ been seven traditional rituals. Of the seven rituals, only three rites were completely\
  \ followed. One rite was held in Labang and two rites were in another village namely\
  \ Panas and Sumentobol. In the field, I feel as an outsider who is trapped in the\
  \ lives of natives. To be able to survive in that place while diving into the lives\
  \ of the people, I always try to narrow the distance with the informants. We build\
  \ mutual communication across cultures or in Geertz (in Pirous 2009: 239), like\
  \ weaving webs of meaning without end.\n\_\_\_\_\_For two weeks, it was difficult\
  \ for me to build relationships with some Labang residents who were very suspicious\
  \ of my presence. My presence is considered odd for reasons as a student who will\
  \ conduct field research. Not only residents, even soldiers at border posts also\
  \ do the same. I was stressed and confused about this condition. But, over time,\
  \ I can build the trust of local residents. About the third week, all local residents\
  \ trusted me as a student.\n\_\_\_\_\_Actually, I'm not afraid of myself. However,\
  \ the unavailability of sufficient electricity at the research site has made me\
  \ often run out of cell phone and leptop power. As a result, the two tools can no\
  \ longer help me to document and record data in the field. Not to mention, the condition\
  \ of my leptop is leaking and can only last a maximum of 30 minutes. Finally, I\
  \ chose to record all events in a day in a diary. In addition, when he found several\
  \ field findings."
