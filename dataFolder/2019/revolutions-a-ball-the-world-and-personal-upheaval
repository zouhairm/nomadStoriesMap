Text: "I'm fast. However, it's nothing in comparison to the speed with which I throw\
  \ a football. It travels at such a rate and spins so dervishly, that it actually\
  \ whistles. For me, this was always normal. I had thrown every single pass with\
  \ all the power my body could muster since I first touched a football in the dark\
  \ days beyond the reach of my memory. This ability, combined with a rebellious,\
  \ gypsy soul, landed me a gig playing American football in Germany. The team gave\
  \ me a time frame of two days to accept or deny the contract. It was a single offer\
  \ made a handful of weeks before the beginning of the season. It was the only option\
  \ to get my career back on track after an eight year absence from football due to\
  \ injury, transfer regulations, and that previously mentioned rebellious, gypsy\
  \ soul. \nI landed in Langenfeld, Germany, a town of roughly 40,000 half way between\
  \ Dusseldorf and Cologne. The team only practiced twice a week. My flatmate, a German\
  \ of a particularly revolting disposition, worked long hours and played on the B\
  \ team. The other American on the team lived in another town. When  you can't hold\
  \ conversations with anyone else, the inner dialogue intensifies. I read roughly\
  \ thirty books in five months. I grew accustomed to being near a person without\
  \ saying a word to them. A far cry from the unique warmth of Florida which crosses\
  \ bumpkin with surfer in the most pleasing of ways. I discovered that within Germany\
  \ the delineation between city and countryside could be sudden and efficient. As\
  \ always, the clever German engineering allowed many old footpaths between the small\
  \ villages between the metropolises of Dusseldorf and Cologne to remain intact.\
  \ My heart would quicken, rushing blood around my body, as I entered the wooded\
  \ borderlands of Langenfeld, not knowing which path I would choose at each fork.\
  \ \nI learned to enjoy silence and solitude. I learned to enjoy the presence of\
  \ an old building. I learned how to catch a train and navigate cities of a different\
  \ country on my own. I learned the frustration of playing sports in a country other\
  \ than the US, which is to say many degrees cooler than hell bent, the average temperature\
  \ for an American athlete of any merit. Then, I learned how to set aside my pride\
  \ and make an earnest effort at learning something as difficult as the German language.\
  \ I made quick progress, which was graciously appreciated by all, but I had started\
  \ too late. I was already back in the states and working the door at a local Irish\
  \ pub. Fast forward 17 months, and a rock band, and I'm back in Germany. Luebeck,\
  \ which lies 40k north of Hamburg, this time. \nI hit the ground running with my\
  \ German this time. I soon spoke it well enough to work as a rock climbing instructor\
  \ as a side gig to playing and coaching football. I delighted at the walkability\
  \ of European cities. I discovered that I grew to love the differences between European\
  \ and American life, rather than laugh uncomprehendingly at them. An Aussie teammate\
  \ lead me to Perth. Time away from music lead to a novel. A need for new challenges\
  \ lead to Brasil. The humility gained from my German and Australian experiences\
  \ created a new version of myself perfectly tuned to harmonize with Brasilian culture.\
  \ I needed less than four months to complete interviews in Portuguese. I fell in\
  \ love with all things Brasilian as I accepted rather than judged. I learned to\
  \ recognize how thought patterns and world views could be dictated by the limitations\
  \ of language, especially within colloquial usage. Also, how everyday slang carries\
  \ an emotional value lost amongst technical jargon. The world is but a reflection\
  \ of our inner selves, an opportunity to learn via experience. Without experience,\
  \ all knowledge is theoretical only. And, amongst the ennead of instructing gods,\
  \ travel is wisdom endowed master from beyond to whom all divinity gratefully inclines\
  \ its head."
