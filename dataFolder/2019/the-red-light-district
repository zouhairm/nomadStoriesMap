Text: "I knew it was my time. As my feet touched ground, the anticipation for adventure\
  \ left replaced by the ability to place one foot in front of the other into a world\
  \ of the unknown. There is unequivocally nothing more stimulating than taking your\
  \ senses through a foreign expedition. There was a familiarity in the wood-fire\
  \ smell that hung in the thick tropical air, but the tone and nuance of French in\
  \ the background were new to me. Bienvenue au Vanuatu, Welcome. \n\nNow there is\
  \ only some much time a holiday should be spent on following the paths of others,\
  \ whether guided by tour or by pamphlets; after that, I think it is down to a little\
  \ creativity and ingenuity, common to us New Zealanders. So after a vibrate melting\
  \ pot of island drumming and French crepe on a backdrops of glistening sea and sand,\
  \ it occurred to me that perhaps it may be time to adventure (off-the-grid style).\
  \ \n\nSpeaking with a Chef at the hotel, I has heard of Club Houses were the men\
  \ of the Island would often drink Karva, smoke, play games and tattoo one-another\
  \ - my ears were spiked to tell you the least. Turns out that there is a bustling\
  \ Red Light District in Vanuatu. I found my Club House after being yelled at from\
  \ a small shack on the side of a dusty road. Entering, I found friends that I would\
  \ like to keep with me for life, though for the first ten minutes or so I was painfully\
  \ aware that I was a small, young white girl in a room of well-built islander men,\
  \ with nothing but a un-covered mattress, a few broken chairs and a language barrier\
  \ between us. \n\nBeing led by unwavering curiosity and unquestionable confidence\
  \ in myself (and my ability to recognize a unsafe situation), I received two invites:\
  \ one to go \"on the town\" in the Vanuatu Red Light District, visiting all of the\
  \ local Karva Bars with the safety of my chaperons and the other from a driver who\
  \ offered to take me on a tour of the island. Both opportunities are rich with stories\
  \ within themselves and the connections I made were absolutely unforgettable; leaving\
  \ me with the lesson, let your feet lead you."
