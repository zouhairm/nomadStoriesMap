Text: "She Is A Princess Long Dead\n\nShe smiles far away at the horizon,\nThe setting\
  \ sun her dazzling diamond!\nBeware of the secret siren,\nThe darkness loves her\
  \ and so does the creepy silence!\n\nIt is always a beautiful site to watch the\
  \ setting sun.An orange sky, many stories, different interpretations. My little\
  \ niece humming a sweet song perched on top of a tiny rock by her mother\u2019s\
  \ side, chewing on her strawberries,a speciality of the region in between.\n\n It\
  \ was an all girls trip. My mother, we sisters and my niece. The evening breeze\
  \ seemed pleasant in an otherwise cold day of January  at  Mahabaleshwar a hill\
  \ station in the Sahyadri mountain ranges in the state of Maharashtra in India .\n\
  \nThis plateau is an amalgamation of enduring springs, picturesque waterfalls and\
  \ a pleasant climate .No wonder  the British selected it as the summer capital of\
  \ Bombay Province during the British Raj. \n\nA tap on my shoulder made me turn\
  \ around and look towards a middle aged lady. \u2018Ah, these random tourists,\u2019\
  \ I thought. The man with those drooping eyes was probably her husband..\n\nArthur\u2019\
  s point also known as Arthur\u2019s seat was the most favoured spot for photography.What\
  \ with the magnificient views of the Savitri Valley on the left and the Brahma-Arayana\
  \ Valley on the right.\u2019Could you please click a picture of us\u2019, said the\
  \ lady.\n\nMy mother calling out on me was what broke the spell or whatever it was.\
  \ A picture translated into many and the strange couple did not even wait for a\
  \ second for us once their showtime was over.\nSunsets can be gloomy too. The tourists\
  \ were nowhere to be seen now. All the strawberry baskets and local vendors seemed\
  \ to have vanished somewhere. The five of us left in our carriage with a coachman\
  \ and his two aides.\nOnce the sun starts to set far away in the west ,what is left\
  \ is only stillness all around. We were the last ones to leave the point on a tonga(\
  \ carriage). The road from this point ,to our hotel in the heart of the city was\
  \ full of rocky roads ,total darkness and unknown men whom we were meeting for the\
  \ first time in our lives.Some emergency lights to guide the carriage were the only\
  \ saving grace.\n Probably to lift up our spirits or to disturb the pregnant pause\
  \  my mother started talking about some Marjorie who would come out of nowhere and\
  \ startle us.Legend has it that Arthur\u2019s point is named after a British officer\
  \ named Arthur Malet who had lost his wife and a month old daughter in an unfortunate\
  \ ferry accident in the Savitri river.\n Since then he would sit staring at the\
  \ river and wish for their coming back to life. A local guide was telling something\
  \ and  what caught our fancy with this name is still unknown.Though he did not mention\
  \ any names.\n\nI looked at my watch it was nine . Dinner was a simple affair. We\
  \ called it a day and tucked ourselves in our comforters.  Small talks and a few\
  \ laughs were our goody bags for the night.\n\n\u2018Let me call the hotel people\
  \ ,ah yes Hello, was the cottage we were staying in have a secret door or what!\
  \ My daughters say something was not quite right yesterday night!\u2019 My mother\
  \ would not let us pass it on as hallucination or a bad dream the next morning.\n\
  \nDressed in green ,beautiful as an emerald was she standing there in the corner\
  \ of our room. Staring! The three of us could sense her. My mother and the niece\
  \ knew nothing about it. \n\nThe hotel staff laughed it off \u2026\u2019Oh, madam,\
  \ how is it possible ?We have already conducted some rituals to ward off such souls\
  \ . Why did they need to perform such rituals in a busy hotel in a crowded area\
  \ ? So they knew something was not right and it was haunted.\n\nWas it Marjorie?\
  \ She had come looking out for the little child? The child\u2019s mother was the\
  \ only one whom she had tried to communicate with. Fingerprints on my sister\u2019\
  s left hand were a testimony to this.\n\nShe indeed had come.\n\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\
