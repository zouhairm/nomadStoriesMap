Text: "Sound had accompanied me through every single step I had taken in Rome: in\
  \ the Colosseum, the Pantheon, the Forum, the Vatican square\u2026 cheerful echoes\
  \ of people who stood right where I was, reluctant to remain silent. In a way I\
  \ found myself running away from it, getting lost in narrow streets guarded by ancient\
  \ statues and Renaissance frescoes. My feet seemed sure about where we were going,\
  \ and I had learned to trust them more than any map that always ended buried in\
  \ the depths of my backpacks. Without realizing the labyrinthine streets ended,\
  \ leaving my fingers with no stone left to follow.\nThe scenery around me outlined\
  \ itself in the golden sky, playing with the shadow of the setting sun to imprint\
  \ its silhouette in the summer air. The hills reflected themselves in the water,\
  \ flowing with its calm waves as I crossed the bridge over the Tiber, searching\
  \ for other stone paths to lose myself in. It was the same stone, but the buildings\
  \ offering me shelter from the open air were different, with its fading colours\
  \ and wooden shutters. Not that I cared. I entered that labyrinth, with cascading\
  \ vines and hidden shrines, the geraniums\u2019 scent matching so well with the\
  \ quietude of a little world that, for an instant, felt only mine. \nI smiled to\
  \ that thought, stretching my hands to a sky that seemed far from the perspective\
  \ of the floor. The cobblestones felt warm against my bare feet; my sandals long\
  \ forgotten on its soft surface as  I nestled in the threshold of a forgotten house.\
  \ Rocked by the murmur of the people passing by, their chatting around the fountain\
  \ of a piazza, echoing in the mosaic walls of a church that seemed to be fighting\
  \ with all its will to stand above everything. I remember the palm trees drawn on\
  \ its surface; its soft earthy colours that even the black stoned floor seemed to\
  \ imitate\u2026\nThen it started to become darker, taking my attention to the little\
  \ drops falling from the sky, as a golden shower make of sunlight. They felt warm\
  \ against my skin, drenching the curls of a messy bun they ended undoing, soaking\
  \ into my very being. I stood there, between the raindrops, my gazed fixed in the\
  \ pouring rain. \nIt felt as if every second in history overlapped around me, as\
  \ if every person who had stood where I was, was there too. From the Rome of legends,\
  \ of gladiators, of empires, of haunting ruins, of Byzantine mosaics, of baroque\
  \ facades, of medieval piazzas\u2026 We were standing under the same sky and walking\
  \ the same earth; we were, in that instant, alive together, and dancing, dancing\
  \ in the rain."
