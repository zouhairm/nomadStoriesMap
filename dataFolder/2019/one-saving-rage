Text: "\xABTake off your glasses. I want to see your eyes.\xBB \nWhen Sal asks you\
  \ to do something, you do it. The fact that he\u2019s a six-foot-seven-something\
  \ homeless guy with the chest of a bull and the thickest, wildest beard you\u2019\
  ve ever seen might have played a part in my acquiescence, at the time, but  I\u2019\
  m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t the reason. Neither was the brightly red cornea of\
  \ his right eye, flooded with arterial blood, or the fact that he had just told\
  \ me he did time for violent crimes. \nNo. Personally, I did it because he was looking\
  \ at me with a tenderness I would have thought impossible for the harsh-looking,\
  \ leather-wearing giant that just a minute prior was shouting \u201Cfuck the police\u201D\
  \ to the passing foot patrol. It felt\u2026unfit. Weird, but in a pleasant way.\n\
  So I took my sunglasses off.\n\nHis eyes were slightly veiled by the clear liquor\
  \ he kept in a water bottle by his side. He wasn\u2019t drunk, not even tipsy, carefully\
  \ sticking to a composed policy of sips small and far apart, just to keep the buzz\
  \ on \u2014a policy he extended to the booze consumption of everybody to whom he\
  \ passed the bottle\u2014.\n\xABTwo sips to give you the inspiration, but not more.\
  \ You don\u2019t wanna get bashed\xBB he told Simon, the youngest in the group,\
  \ before he left to hustle some money singing in the station. \nHe silently made\
  \ sure that anybody didn\u2019t overdo anything; kindness, you see, sometimes has\
  \ the face of benign hinderance.\nHe sweetly reprimanded Toasty (the Irishest Irishman\
  \ to ever walk the streets of Coney Island) when his juggling with a bunch of onions\
  \ started becoming annoying to everyone, checked a bunch of times on Dave, sleeping\
  \ maybe a bit too soundly, and when a couple of friends joined the party he was\
  \ the one to make the necessary introductions and explain who this Italian hanging\
  \ with them was.\n\xABThat guy looks thin, but he\u2019s strong as fuck. I mean\
  \ it, he will fuck you, me or anyone else up in a fight, one hundred percent.\xBB\
  \ He said at one point nodding towards Adam, tangled with Toasty in a playful brawl.\n\
  \xABHe\u2019s a good kid.\xBB He added, with a half-smile. \nWeird.\nKindness, you\
  \ see, in that particular moment seemed to mean rolling on the curb, gripped in\
  \ a deadlock.\n\nIt\u2019s alway the easy words that betray you. Always.\nYou learn\
  \ them as a child and stick a meaning on them, an unequivocal label, hence robbing\
  \ them of their depths, complexities, nuances. You flatten them, create expectations.\n\
  So pain is always bad, love always good. \nAnd kindness, kindness is always gentle.\
  \ \nIs it, though?\nWhere do you draw the line between the need for a dictionary\
  \ and the virtually endless complexity of reality? What\u2019s the acceptable amount\
  \ of roughness in an act of love, before it turns into violence?\n\nMy phone chimed:\
  \ there were trains to be taken, clothes to be changed and dates with cute waitresses\
  \ to be attended - a story for another time. \nI got up and explained my situation.\n\
  Toasty raised his tattooed fist to bump mine, a sour grin on his Irish face. So\
  \ did Dave, Simon and all the others, in the Coney Island version of a fond goodbye.\
  \ \nI finally raised my hand towards Sal. He slowly shook his head.\n\xABThis\xBB\
  \ he bumped his own fists together and making them bounce far apart \xABI don\u2019\
  t like it. This drives people away. Come here.\xBB He waited as I kneeled to get\
  \ to his level and slowly raised his arm, solemn and tipsy and deeply unserious\
  \ at the same time.\nHe grabbed my forearm and looked me in the eye, nodding. Then\
  \ he pulled me in a leathery,  bottom-shelf-booze-scented hug.\nAnd that\u2019s\
  \ it. This is how it ends. No moral to the story (unless we want to go into cheesy\
  \ 90\u2019s movies philosophy), no closure, no follow-up.\nJust the train home.\n\
  \nAs for Sal\u2019s words, I fear I still have to process them properly.\nI guess\
  \ sometimes kindness is just a militant form of anger."
