Text: "Siem Reap airport is small and anonymous. An old-fashioned farmhouse in the\
  \ middle of the Cambodian countryside that stands out only for its fake gold decorations\
  \ in pure Southeast Asian style. Even from the outside you would not be able to\
  \ tell that it hosts an international airport. Not even from the inside, for the\
  \ matter. Everything that we could see was an old-style, somewhat empty hall, but\
  \ maybe it only depended on the time of the day.\n\nIt's past 9 pm and we have just\
  \ landed here after three weeks wandering around Thailand. Cambodia was not planned.\
  \ We simply said to ourselves \"why not? We have time and it\u2019s close\". We\
  \ booked the first and cheapest AirAsia flight we could find and packed our things.\
  \ Without knowing anything about this somewhat secluded country, without having\
  \ much interest in it.\n\nBut Cambodia is not Thailand, Cambodia is different and\
  \ it has been a leap into the unknown starting from that small non-airport in the\
  \ middle of nowhere, where a long desk packed of Khmer employees checked our passports,\
  \ each with their own specific task. One inscrutable man in a blue suit looked at\
  \ the passport picture, then passed it to the following one who wrote down our names,\
  \ onto the next who put a stamp on it and so on. In what seemed to us a never-ending\
  \ assembly line. But in fact it ended and Cambodia welcome us into its streets.\
  \ That was just a little anticipation of what Cambodia would have been for us. We\
  \ wandered through its temples, ate its food, talked to its people and tried to\
  \ immerse ourselves in its history and culture so different from ours. But there\
  \ was always something that we missed. A detail that we would not understand, a\
  \ nuance, an inflection of the voice that never allowed us to fully grasp the meaning\
  \ of this small but yet big country, still torn and anonymous to most of the west\
  \ world. Weird and incredibly fascinating."
