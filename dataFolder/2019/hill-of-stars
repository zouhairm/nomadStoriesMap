Text: "The prayer call had just ended. The dark still enveloped this little village\
  \ in Gombong quietly. Maybe pulling the blankets closer to our chest sounded nice,\
  \ but not that day. On Saturday July 7th 2018, my family and I were up to go to\
  \ Dieng Plateau in Wonosobo, Central Java.\nWe got up early that morning, took wudhu\
  \ from the freezing water to pray before showers. My cousins and I were so excited\
  \ to go to Dieng that day. We had to skip breakfast because we needed to depart\
  \ as early as possible in order to reach Wonosobo before traffic. We departed around\
  \ 5 a.m. It was still dark outside, but we had met villagers walking from the mosque\
  \ and vehicles brought fresh vegetables to the market. We drove through the pine\
  \ forest on the hill, took an alternative route through Banjar Negara. The road\
  \ was quiet, even it was still foggy at some points. It brought us climbing up the\
  \ hill, before going down and taking directions towards Wonosobo.\nAs our car climbed\
  \ up the hill, the sky got lighter. The fog began to fade, so the sight got clearer.\
  \ We reached the top of the hill, administratively located in the district of Karang\
  \ Sambung, Banjar Negara, and saw its beauty. The pine forest surrounding us was\
  \ painted in dark green, with white thin fog covering like a cotton blanket. The\
  \ sky was coloured in pastel combination of purple, pink and yellow, welcoming the\
  \ sunrise. And a valley was right next to us, green with plantations. From the height,\
  \ we could see villages and small town around the hill. My cousin, Danar, said that\
  \ this hill was called the Hill of Stars. He told us that people usually come here\
  \ to enjoy the view from its height, mostly at night on weekends or holidays. This\
  \ place, he added, was quiet famous among youth there. Also, there is a tourism\
  \ spot nearby.\nWe settled for a while and watch that wonderful view of the paramount.\
  \ My dad turned off the car\u2019s engine and opened the window, letting the fresh\
  \ morning air circulated in our car. After some moments at the hill, he turned on\
  \ the engine and we moved on to our destination. This story might be short, but\
  \ this short story was my personal discovery of a new place. I had never heard about\
  \ this hill before and never expected to come here coincidently. It was kind of\
  \ surprising for me to find it while having trip with my family. And I promised\
  \ myself to come back to the hill of stars one day."
