Text: "I have always loved travelling \u2013 the smell of a train station or just\
  \ the thought of going somewhere new and exciting gives me a special vibe and I\u2019\
  m afraid I already infected also my children with it.\n \nMore than simply travelling\
  \ I like the touch of everyday life and simplicity of local people\u2019s life in\
  \ a new place. It is not always possible to get this feeling, but it always brings\
  \ me joy and fulfillment. \n\nOne of those enjoyable periods happened while I was\
  \ visiting Nepal back in 2005. I went there as a volunteer and quite quickly settled\
  \ in a small town called Panauti some 30 km from the capital city Kathmandu. A house\
  \ in town called Peace Home was both my home and my working place and became the\
  \ center of my life there.\n\nSome of my tasks as a volunteer were related to teaching\
  \ English to groups of local youth \u2013 a new experience for me which turned out\
  \ to be enjoyable and inspirational. I don\u2019t have a common language with the\
  \ Nepalese, so I had to involve a lot of drawing or acting or talking each time\
  \ I was explaining the meaning of a new word. Those classes became the foundation\
  \ of many other things that happened during my month in Nepal \u2013 starting with\
  \ a joint nail polishing session through some cooking and eating together and then\
  \ also some of my pupils teenage-girls got very enthusiastic about helping me get\
  \ appropriately dressed up as a local and brought me shopping for fabric and then\
  \ to the tailors\u2019. This showed the place in quite a different light to me \u2013\
  \ while I was perceived as merely another tourist while going around town on my\
  \ own, the attitude of shop-owners changed a lot when they would see me within the\
  \ bunch of local girls. So, I still owe a gorgeous tailor-made red sari to remind\
  \ me of this period \u2013 I just got married before travelling to Nepal and therefore\
  \ I was allowed to wear red (as the \u201Creserved\u201D colour for married women).\
  \ \n\nOf course it could not go without some goofy situations either \u2013 during\
  \ one of the visits to the capital city I was tempted at one of the markets and\
  \ bought a wonderful pair of trousers that I call now the \u201Ctrap for tourists\u201D\
  \ because I don\u2019t actually think this is something traditional even if with\
  \ beautiful traditional design. It is basically a piece of fabric that one binds\
  \ around the waist in front and on the back and it forms something like the trouser\
  \ legs with the tiny little detail that it opens on the side up to the top. Soon\
  \ after that I was travelling again to Kathmandu for some meetings with other organisations\
  \ and I decided to put on the new pair of trousers. What I did not think of was\
  \ the fact that while in Kathmandu I was given a ride by a local colleague on his\
  \ motorbike. So, I had to sit behind him on the motorbike for a few rides on that\
  \ day and each time the dilemma was whether I prefer to remain on the bike and hold\
  \ to the driver or to hold my open trouser legs. Since I survived all the rides\
  \ you can guess correctly that my thighs was seen a lot in the city at this day\
  \ because my arms were stuck to the guy riding the motor in a frenetic trial to\
  \ not fall at one of the turns or so."
