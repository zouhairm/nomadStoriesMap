Text: "It has been 8 years now, but this memory is something which will stay with\
  \ me forever. \nBack to the way of my home, my mother told me \u201Cwe are going\
  \ home tomorrow\".\n\nHome: that has always been a single room with 3 more people\
  \ around me, it wasn't the same this time. It was something which I didn't expect\
  \ in the 14 years of my life at that time.\n\nIt was the first time when we were\
  \ going to our hometown 'Nepal' to meet our family. My father never discussed them\
  \ with us, it was my mother only who stood with him every time and encouraged him\
  \ to forget about past and start a new journey. We left our house around 4 in the\
  \ morning and sat in the bus around 6 am.\n\nWhere I was too excited to meet the\
  \ family of which I have never even heard about, I was also kind of nervous to go\
  \ to that place where everything was so different. I didn't even know the basic\
  \ local language to communicate.\n'It is a long way around 3 days minimum' my father\
  \ said.  He was happy & restless, and I could see that on his face.  As I woke up\
  \ so early I slept in the bus and then directly woke up at the place where everyone\
  \ had to get down, because that was the end for that bus. Nepal was not much developed\
  \ at that time hence, there was no direct commuting mean to go ahead. So we started\
  \ walking.\n It was somewhere around five in the evening when something amazing\
  \ happened. There was something special about that evening. Maybe it was the place,\
  \ Yes it surely was the place! there were huge mountains adjacent to clean black\
  \ empty road on one side, with the golden glaze like shine of the big beautiful\
  \ drowning Orange sun on it. Where on the other side it was a beautiful deep valley.\
  \ Birds were going to their nest and their chirping was like the most beautiful\
  \ song on the earth and the sun was so big that you would have felt like standing\
  \ in the middle of a spotlight. \n\nAlthough, it was windy cold the warmth of watching\
  \ the beautiful sunset for the first time was mesmerizing. There were small houses\
  \ made of mud with no sign of electricity and people there were still happy. They\
  \ were happy in the small world of them with their family and day to day work. Just\
  \ by seeing them you could have felt their friendly nature and obvious excitement\
  \ to see the outsiders specially a girl (Me) wearing shorts. The smiley faces and\
  \ kind attitude of all the people there was the another beauty of that place. \n\
  After walking for around 20 minutes more we saw a guest house and booked 2 rooms\
  \ for us. As it was a long and tiring day everybody slept by the minute they laid\
  \ on bed where I was thinking about the whole day and slept in the last.\n\nI didn't\
  \ expect, that walk would be so memorable that it had actually made me see not just\
  \ the beauty, it made me feel the peace of home too. \n\nAfter the exact three days\
  \ of journey I reached my home.  Home, that waited for us for a long time. I saw\
  \ a woman there old and thin, with Grey hair and beautiful Green eyes. She was my\
  \ grandmother. I couldn't recognize her, but she did. She knew who I was like she\
  \ knows me. She was happy and crying."
