Text: "The Start\n\nI guess I\u2019ve been waiting my whole life for this. Sitting\
  \ in an airport, waiting to board a flight to Stockholm, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019\
  ve ever had a feeling like this. Maybe I have and the medication made me forget\
  \ as it often does so.\n\nI wish I could say I\u2019m doing this because I\u2019\
  ve had this huge revelation after coming of age like Holden Caulfield did. But my\
  \ life, life in general is made up of moments over years. Why can\u2019t we all\
  \ walk around New York City alone for three days or spend a summer falling in love\
  \ with the wrong person to come-of-age? Instead we sit here through little moments\
  \ where we have little revelations that are supposed to add up to some big hooray\
  \ or something. What do I know though? I\u2019m 19 and I still haven\u2019t figured\
  \ this shit out. Or maybe I did and I just forgot.\n\nWhat I do know is that all\
  \ those little revelations are what led me here, not specifically today, but the\
  \ day I bought these tickets and booked this flight. Right after that night last\
  \ summer when I was curled up, hyperventilating on my kitchen floor and realized\
  \ I could die any second and it was now or never to get up and go.\n\n***\n\nThe\
  \ Daze\n\nHow do you explain to someone the feeling of being in a daze when you\
  \ land in another continent in the middle of the night? There\u2019s anxiety of\
  \ tiptoeing through a hostel room trying to make sure the lock on your backpack\
  \ isn\u2019t jingling and waking up your new short term roommates. There\u2019s\
  \ the toll that three layovers without sleeping have taken on your still young body.\
  \ The heaviness in your mind and muscles sinks you into the depths of the worn down\
  \ mattress and for the first time in a long time you fall asleep in a minute.\n\n\
  ***\n\nThe Relief\n\nYour roommates aren\u2019t so kind at 7 AM, but it\u2019s ok\
  \ that the noise woke you up. There\u2019s no more daze. There\u2019s a horrifying\
  \ amount of excitement when you realize you\u2019re not home and you don\u2019t\
  \ know exactly where you are. Suddenly you rise up and turn around to look through\
  \ the small window in this fourth floor walk up hostel. You\u2019re no longer in\
  \ a daze. Everything is crystal clear. It\u2019s spring in Stockholm and the ocean\
  \ is as blue as the they are in postcards. The boat docked right in front of your\
  \ hostel is showing off a massive Swedish flag that flows in the breeze. Behind\
  \ it, across the inlet, is what you can only imagine is a palace. The regal stone\
  \ work and statues must have inspired a thousand fairy tales because nothing has\
  \ ever looked so perfect in your life. It\u2019s a reality pulled from dreams.\n\
  \n***\n\nThe Delayed Revelation\n\nPeople always say that travelling changes them.\
  \ I guess in a way it does. That morning when I woke up and looked out the window\
  \ I started a 10 week trip that shaped who I am. I learnt of independence and friendship.\
  \ I experienced heartbreak and connected to feelings that I didn\u2019t even know\
  \ existed within me. I gathered courage to be comfortable on my own and I also realized\
  \ that no matter how far you go you\u2019ll always find someone who reminds you\
  \ of home. I don\u2019t like to think that travelling changed me, I like to think\
  \ that travelling just bought out the best of me. It made me more myself than I\
  \ ever imagined I could be. Years later when I returned to that window and looked\
  \ out to see the same boat, same flag, and same palace I realized I\u2019m the person\
  \ I\u2019ve always dreamt of being. It isn\u2019t always perfect, but I know I\u2019\
  ve never cried on my kitchen floor since.\n\n\"So I hold two fingers up to yesterday\n\
  Light a cigarette and smoke it all away\nI got out, I got out, I'm alive and I'm\
  \ here to stay\"\nTwo Fingers by Jake Bugg"
