  \ friends!\nI assure you that our world will have been in joy and bliss forever.\
  \ You can hear silence\u2019s last breaths, wind\u2019s feet are gone; it cannot\
  \ knock any one\u2019s door to convey a lover\u2019s message; for this we should\
  \ thankful of our friend; he pointed to a person in crowd; he threw the wind out\
  \ of his window and finished this harbinger of lovers forever. All trees hate it\

  \ cap on neck with cut head, short and fat with sword in hands to cut new comers\u2019\
  \ heads. I tried to stop myself from going toward him but failed and suddenly his\
  \ sword comedown on my neck. I jumped from my bed to outside where my little sister\
  \ was waiting for me with a small lovely gift\u2026..."
