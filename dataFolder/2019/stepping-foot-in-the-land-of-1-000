Text: "Though I tried to keep calm throughout the morning, I was a ball of nerves\
  \ when I arrived in Phuket at 11:30am. I had only a tourist visa and a one-way ticket\
  \ to Thailand. With no firm plans and a hiccup with my departure from Switzerland,\
  \ I was preparing my mind for being sent back to the US.\n\nI got in.\n\nMy arrival\
  \ in Phuket was hardly the end of my journey. I was promptly taken by overpriced\
  \ cab to a bus stop.  There I waited for 2.5 hours in the Thai summer heat for a\
  \ bus which took 4-5 hours to arrive in Nakhon Si Thammmarat. It was muggy and smelled\
  \ like beans that were beginning to spoil. I sat in the very back corner of the\
  \ back row, squeezed in with a man on the far side and  between us a woman and her\
  \ two small children. At one point she just popped out her breast to feed her baby.\
  \ I was surprised a bit, given how full the van was, the presence of the man sitting\
  \ right next to her, as well as the Muslim couple just in front of us. However,\
  \ it makes sense! Her baby is hungry and that is nature\u2019s way! My Western eyes\
  \ are used to breasts being shown only in relation to sex, which is completely acceptable\
  \ in the Western world, whereas breastfeeeding is ironically shocking. What is wrong\
  \ with us?\n\nThe bus ride was bumpy and he sped dangerously around motorbikes and\
  \ sharp turns in the road. However, I was so exhausted that I began to fall asleep\
  \ anyway, waking every time my head hit the knob above the window. The ride just\
  \ kept dragging on: someone getting off, someone getting on, always filling whatever\
  \ seat had been vacated. My eagerness got the best of me and I almost hopped out\
  \ at a couple of stops, hoping I had arrived. By the time I had actually arrived\
  \ the sun had set and I had given up asking. The driver opened the door and announced\
  \ \u201CNakhon Si Thammarat\u201D. I was there.\n\nI meandered down the road with\
  \ my luggage, hoping to spot my hotel. It was a busy street and I had been told\
  \ that it was close by. I was stopped after about a block by a Thai woman at a food\
  \ stand who was hoping that I would be hungry. I told her that I was looking for\
  \ a hotel and made a gesture with my hands to indicate my head resting on a pillow.\
  \ She seemed to understand and began speaking to two younger women in Thai. They\
  \ inquired in English about my hotel, trying to help me find it. We looked for a\
  \ number but I only had an address. She then called a cab, which never came. Finally,\
  \ eager to not leave me abandoned, she suggested that she call her \u201Cbrother\u201D\
  \ who came to pick me up and take me. He loaded my bags into his new compact Toyota\
  \ and found my hotel: the bright pink Teeny House. After helping me up to my room,\
  \ the group invited me to dinner."
