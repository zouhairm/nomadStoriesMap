Text: "I had never seen a storm like that. Rain was coming down in sheets, in buckets;\
  \ like a dam had just burst and we were the unlucky fish swimming below it. We huddled\
  \ together under our makeshift hut of bamboo and palm leaves, water dripping down\
  \ the gaps on the roof, soaking us to our core, and waited. That\u2019s all we could\
  \ do - wait.\n\nA few days earlier, as our volunteering project in a remote Fijian\
  \ island drew to a close, three of us had decided that maybe the island wasn\u2019\
  t quite remote enough - after all, we had a roof above our heads every night, and\
  \ every morning we would wake up to the sizzling sounds of our Fijian host mums\
  \ making delicious breakfast buns over the fire. We craved a different feeling,\
  \ a reminder that we were in fact stranded on a rock the size of a small town in\
  \ the middle of the Pacific Ocean; a connection that, in our minds, even a few solar\
  \ powered lights and wooden buildings were hindering.\n\nWith this desire in mind,\
  \ we set off for our destination: a sandy islet across the bay, barely bigger than\
  \ a football field and covered in palm trees. We waded water up to our hips at low\
  \ tide, carrying nothing but a few knives and a homemade fishing rod, and determined\
  \ to stay the night. We wasted no time: by dusk, we were gathered around a fire,\
  \ an array of small fish cooking over it, next to a bamboo frame covered with braided\
  \ palm leaves and a pile of coconuts for drinking water and a tasty treat. It was\
  \ perfect: just us and this lush nature and a blanket of a million stars like our\
  \ home European skies haven\u2019t seen in our lifetimes. That is, until the storm\
  \ started.\n\nWhile the rain poured down and the waves roared, so close that I thought\
  \ one would come and sweep us away, I couldn\u2019t help but think of another storm.\
  \ A few months earlier, when I was home in Spain, I had heard the story of a boat\
  \ that set off from Morocco, carrying a few hundred African immigrants across the\
  \ Strait of Gibraltar and trying to reach the Spanish coast. Halfway through, the\
  \ boat was caught in a storm that threw dozens of people overboard and left the\
  \ rest adrift for days. Waiting for the storm to pass, just like we were. But they,\
  \ unlike us, were also waiting on a different storm: waiting for the sun to shine\
  \ again in times so desperate that they would risk crossing the ocean on a small\
  \ floating piece of rubber with the hopes of finding something better on the other\
  \ side.\n\nReflecting upon the storm the next night, a roof over my head and a hot\
  \ cup of tea on my lap, my thoughts kept drifting to the boat. I felt grateful,\
  \ but also disheartened. Grateful that I in a position to call our adventure just\
  \ that - an adventure. That all we had to do, as wet, cold and miserable as it seemed\
  \ at the moment, was wait for the rain to subside and the tide to recede to make\
  \ our way back to a cozy house and familiar faces. Disheartened that not everyone\u2019\
  s storms are like ours, that those migrants were lost to the sea or sent back across\
  \ it, lost to the desert they had come from. All gone with the storm. In the midst\
  \ of a refugee crisis and rise of nationalism in Europe, with many so eager to pinpoint\
  \ immigrants as the cause of everything wrong with our economies and societies,\
  \ all I could think was: What would we do if we hadn\u2019t been so lucky? What\
  \ would we do if this storm we got caught in didn\u2019t last a night but a decade?\
  \ Would we keep waiting, or would we try to cross an ocean to get away from it?"
