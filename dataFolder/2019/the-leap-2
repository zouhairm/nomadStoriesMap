Text: "After missing early morning flight for my graduate school orientation I find\
  \ myself tear stained, aggravated for missing my alarm at the ticket counter, re\
  \ booking the flight at a random date because I would have missed the orientation\
  \ anyway if I we're to fly on the next flight out. There I was on an Uber going\
  \ home, catching my breathe with a flight schedule in the middle of February. Who\
  \ travels the country on February? No one. Everyone is still recuperating from our\
  \ very much extended Philippine holidays. \n\nThe date came and cram my backpack\
  \ with a weeks worth of clothes. plane and bus printed tickets on hand and my camera.\
  \ My anxiety wasn't kind at me that night but I just needed to find a way to get\
  \ on that flight and it would rev the engine my travel solo game to a different\
  \ level. I landed and found my way to the overnight bus terminal, ready for my 8-\
  \ 10 hour trip to Baguio, I then transfer to a regular bus for  5 hour trip to Bontoc\
  \ and 1 hour jeepney ride to the mountain area called Maligcong where there is a\
  \ good view of the rice terraces and a sea of clouds. The trip was uneventfully\
  \ but absolutely beautiful, it was 180 degree views of the rice terraces, fresh\
  \ breeze and friendly people. The home stay was warm and absolutely vacant, because\
  \ I was right no one travels on February. I got fever upon arriving on the mountain\
  \ province but decided to pursue the trek up the mountain early the next day. Boy,\
  \ was that a bad idea. I was trudging my feet, light minded from the fever but managed\
  \ to climb at least 1/4 of the trail until I fainted and my mountain guide refused\
  \ to take me anywhere but back to the homestay. Back at the home stay the kindest\
  \ homestay owner was so nice to set me up a good meal and (I  swear to God) the\
  \ best coffee I have ever tasted. When leaving, she walked me to the jeepney stop\
  \ and as I was riding some people where asking me If I was the lady who fainted\
  \ up the hill earlier. \"Why, yes, I was!\" I answered, playfully embarrassed to\
  \ be recognize as such. Word goes around these small town. They did invite me to\
  \ get better and stay longer so I can actually rest before I climb again. I've taken\
  \ the offer up and as soon as I finish my graduate thesis I am going back.\n\nI\
  \ have been to lots of solo travel since then. I have absolutely no fear in travelling\
  \ alone now since my circumstances when I do travel alone, have proven to me time\
  \ and time again that people are naturally kind and approachable beings. I knew\
  \ as soon as I paid for the overpriced re book that that was my leap to solo travel."
