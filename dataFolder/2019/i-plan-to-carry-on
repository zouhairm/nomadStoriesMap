Text: "I\u2019ve  Plan to Carry-on\n\nOn March 23 @ 10 AM I was marched out of my\
  \ job of 13 years into a future I had not expected; I was 61 and fired. I went through\
  \ all five phases of mourning; denial and isolation; anger; bargaining; depression;\
  \ and acceptance. My coping mechanism was sleep, I slept for about a month and than\
  \ I woke-up, literally and figuratively. \n\nSince I had no job, or immediate plans\
  \ and I was flying solo through life; I decided I needed to get a life more than\
  \ I needed to get another corporate cubicle to decorate. I wanted to see beyond\
  \ my present-day borders; this meant updating my passport, which I did immediately.\
  \ F__k waiting until I lost 20 pounds to take my passport photo, this curvy lady\
  \ fit just fine into those itty-bitty airline seats. \n  \nSo with a brand new passport,\
  \ I started watching the airfares, my first destination was going to be on sale.\
  \ Lucky me, it turned out to be ITALY! I got a round trip ticket to Italy for $363.00.\
  \ Yes, I have to get to Newark; Yes, I have a 19-hour layover in Chicago; Yes, it\
  \ will take me 2-days to make a trip that should take 10 hours. I've got the time.\n\
  \nI never imagined that half the fun of traveling was learning how to travel. After\
  \ booking my ticket, I made the momentous decision to do 15-days of travel with\
  \ only a carry-on and a personal bag. I watched hundreds of YouTube videos on traveling\
  \ light. Should I get a hardcover suitcase or a backpack? Why are all the YouTube\
  \ demonstrators\u2019 size six? If you wear a size 12 or 14, do you have to take\
  \ fewer clothes? Who can fit their makeup into a baggie? These are all things I\
  \ was learning from travelers who went before me. I was not going to play pack mule\
  \ on a trip where I would be challenged by cobblestone street and step. I went with\
  \ the hardcover suitcase and visited my sister in Vancouver, WA for 7-days, I didn\u2019\
  t get to use my new passport, but I did use my new carry-on. I actually over packed.\
  \ \n\nNow that I had a ticket, destination and the knowledge of packing like a pro.\
  \ I needed an itinerary. I decided to explore Rome, Tuscany, Florence, Venice and\
  \ the beaches of Lido. Three days in each city, by way of Airbnb\u2019s. I loved\
  \ picking out the perfect Airbnb to fit my new wanderlust. Everyplace I chose was\
  \ available, my timing was impeccable just a few weeks before the high season. Airbnb\u2019\
  s also gave me an extra level of security, my host would be my concierge and friend.\
  \ But I don\u2019t plan to hide out in my room, I started booking tours. I booked\
  \ so many tours I duplicated a few and left other off by accident. I was being a\
  \ glutton for food tours. A geek for art. And stalker of architecture and hillsides.\
  \ I planned my vacation like I had the energy of a 21-year-old instead of the second-wind\
  \ of a 61 years old. Eh. Who cares? \n\nI found booking adventures through Airbnb,\
  \ TakeWalks.com, and RomaEats were my best options for this excursion. These companies\
  \ welcomed the single traveler with open arms, and I was able to reach out and message\
  \ my tour guide direct while making my plans. I tried not to book every moment and\
  \ left myself the Beaches of Lido to unwind before boarding a trip home.\n\nFinally,\
  \ not able to throw all caution to the wind, I bought flight insurance, trip insurance,\
  \ an airplane pillow, a VPN, a RFID blocking travel bag, universal plugs, a whistle,\
  \ and extra toilet paper. These were items mentioned as must have when traveling.\
  \ I don\u2019t want to be caught stranded. \n\nI know I will make lots of travel\
  \ mistakes on this trip, but I will do better on the next trip, and the one after\
  \ that; because I now have a plan . . . to see the world."
