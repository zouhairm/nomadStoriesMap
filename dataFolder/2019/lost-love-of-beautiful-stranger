Text: "one time I went to a place called Bandung or often called Paris Van Java, also\
  \ called the flower city. It has been a long time since this foot has not stepped\
  \ up to find cool natural beauty and also the requirements for customary and cultural\
  \ charms. Saturday, March 31, 2018, I went on vacation and traveled on a motorbike\
  \ to the Ciwidey area of \u200B\u200BBandung, along the way I was presented with\
  \ beautiful scenery and cool air so I had to wear a jacket, besides the weather\
  \ was raining, coupled with a mountainous area. In the charm of nature that I am\
  \ enjoying in the midst of solitude, I see a girl who is beautiful and also sweet,\
  \ the figure of a girl who looks simple with a traditional dress with her friends,\
  \ I can see the sweet smile emanating from the girl's face will not be forgotten\
  \ . Especially when the beautiful girl glanced with a smile and blushed while occasionally\
  \ joking with her friend, not even if this eye blinked at the cute girl, I would\
  \ like to go closer and say hello to the girl in my heart. But just a few minutes\
  \ I walked towards the girl to go with her friends to leave the place. Soon my cellphone\
  \ rang and when I received the call, I decided to go home because there was a need\
  \ for parents. But the next day I decided to go back to the area, this time I intended\
  \ to take a selfie, on Sunday morning I was driving again, this time I was accompanied\
  \ by a friend who was also a lover of natural beauty. Hamdan and I departed at 6am\
  \ towards Ciwidey Bandung. With a little preparation and provision for the trip,\
  \ we both feel confident we will get good and interesting photos. But it implied\
  \ in my small heart that I might meet again with the sweet girl who was there yesterday,\
  \ we were so excited that we ignored the weather and the cold air that covered the\
  \ area. When we arrived there, only the fog covered the whole area, we also took\
  \ a break to just eat and drink the supplies we brought. Some sandwiches and a cup\
  \ of warm coffee. In that drizzle I suddenly heard the sound of the beautiful girl,\
  \ soon I was looking for the source of the sound. Sure enough the girl I saw yesterday\
  \ was having a joke, but this time accompanied by a man who was quite handsome.\
  \ There was a feeling of happiness but also a little sad, because the rain didn't\
  \ stop, finally we decided to leave the place. With a sense of disappointment at\
  \ not having had the chance to take a selfie with the girl, and haven't had the\
  \ chance to meet the sweet girl. There was the girl's nickname, Asih, so they called\
  \ his name. I do not know who exactly the girl's name, which is definitely a sweet\
  \ smile always imagined when daydreaming alone. That is the short story that I have\
  \ experienced, hopefully it is good and I thank you."
