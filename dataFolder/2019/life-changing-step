Text: "Hi, my name is Michael. And I want to tell you my story. \nAfter my friend's\
  \ suicide, a turning point came in my life. At that moment, I realized that something\
  \ needs to be changed or I will end up just like him: I will die from loneliness\
  \ in a small room filled with an irritable atmosphere. Before I have never communicated\
  \ with other people. I had about 2-3 friends with whom I didn\u2019t go anywhere.\
  \ I spent all the time at home and every time when I left the house and started\
  \ talking to someone, I was panicked and I suddenly stopped talking. I believed\
  \ that the life of the algorithms is correct and any spontaneous situation can destroy\
  \ me. \nEverything changed at one moment when I asked my friend Julia to do something\
  \ that would turn my life upside down. I collected those things that she told me\
  \ to take with me and we met at the morning near my house. I was scared to death\
  \ when a taxi brought us to the airport. When I asked her for a favor, I meant that\
  \ such as walking near the house or going to the movies, but definitely not this!\
  \ Now we are already flying to Miami ... All the time I spent at the airport and\
  \ at the plane was very nervous, I was shaking like a leaf and thought: \u201CWhy?\
  \ Why did I want a change?\u201D After arriving at the hotel on Miami-Beach, I still\
  \ couldn't believe that I was so far from home. In the evening we went to the balcony\
  \ where there were large soft sofas, we enjoyed cocktails and Julia tried to make\
  \ me talk. Actually, she did it! After two glasses of a delicious local drink, I\
  \ began to suggest topics for conversation myself. This evening was awesome! We\
  \ talked, laughed and looked at the boundless ocean. \nThe morning of the second\
  \ day began with a swim and it really made me scared. I never swam and absolutely\
  \ couldn't swim. Julia immediately dived into the water and swam like a mermaid.\
  \ I stood on the coast... \nI was very ashamed to admit to Julia that I was afraid\
  \ even of water. Soon, I slowly began to come in the water. It took me 15 minutes\
  \ to my knees get down under water. Julia looked at me very strangely and I decided\
  \ to pretend that everything was going according to plan. I moved my legs from side\
  \ to side and tried to dive into the water. I don't know what I was thinking, but\
  \ I began to breathe underwater and oddly enough, I began to drown. Julia quickly\
  \ realized what was happening and pulled me out of the water. I have never been\
  \ so ashamed before... \nShe calmed me down, took my hand and we went into the water\
  \ together. She showed me movements with her arms and legs, and I repeated them.\
  \ And after a while, I was able to stay on the water. I CAN SWIM! I screamed for\
  \ joy and she smiled sweetly. \nWe still did many things, even went to a party in\
  \ the evening and I was able to talk with other people. All this made me very happy,\
  \ but 5 days passed quickly. \nOn the evening of the last day, we went to a restaurant\
  \ on the beach. Then I first time tried oysters, which it tastes like snot ... At\
  \ some point, I felt absolute happiness and realized that without Julia, I couldn't\
  \ do it. I hugged her and thought a minute ... kissed her ... Only then I realized\
  \ what I did, because we're just friends! What am I doing? She looked at me and\
  \ smiled. I thought: \u201Cwhy are you smiling?\u201D \nShe just kissed me back\
  \ and we continued our dinner. We're back home. Then she became my girlfriend...\
  \ \nI used to think that any step into the unknown would kill me. However, I made\
  \ the jump. In addition, it gave me a new life. A leap into the unknown made me\
  \ understand that not everything that is unknown is bad."
