Text: "Had I made a difference I thought to myself as I watched it sink. Helpless.\
  \ He had won. Again.\n\nMarch, 2018. An ordinary month. Until the water stopped.\
  \ Sending the city into a frenzy, supermarket shelves emptied with no news of further\
  \ deliveries. I, like many, was becoming frustrated by the tupperware showers I\
  \ was enduring with no end in sight. Water was no longer a commodity, despite being\
  \ able to see the ocean beyond the cliff just a few of blocks away. \n\nSeveral\
  \ days passed by.\n\nAssured it was safer now, I apprehensively agreed to join the\
  \ efforts to support those in greater need. My motivation torn between charity and\
  \ insight.\n\nAfter a long bus journey, leaving behind the thick, relentless traffic\
  \ that surrounds Lima, we arrived at our destination. Choisica. Upon a first glance,\
  \ all seemed ordinary for a suburban town; dusty and rough around the edges. \n\n\
  Then reality hit. The roads were filled with sand bags, glued together haphazardly\
  \ with a gooey brown substance. It covered walls up to waist high, oozed from windows\
  \ and doors. There has been no escaping its wrath.\n\nMy jaw dropped lower as we\
  \ reached the void in the wall. The entrance to a once basic residence, lacking\
  \ necessities, four short walls, no roof, no door. The home of Diego, Diego and\
  \ three other families, was now submerged in mud. The unfortunate gift bestowed\
  \ by torrential rains from the Andes. The huaicos created had filled the homes of\
  \ the already impoverished.\n\nOur mission was clear, to free the abode and salvage\
  \ the meagre collection of furniture that lied beneath. We gathered our tools of\
  \ choice; whatever was to hand: half a shovel, a broken bucket.\n\nAfter several\
  \ hours, the edges of furniture had begun to reveal themselves. A brief glimpse\
  \ of the life once lived here. We focused on liberating a single mattress. Mud had\
  \ penetrated every inch of its being. Moving it became impossible, its weight too\
  \ much for our remaining strength. We gave up, disheartened, defeated by nature.\n\
  \nAlthough exhausted, we agreed to return with more labour. We hoped our photos\
  \ and stories would inspire support from others.\n\nAs we made our exit, I noticed\
  \ Diego's daughter, Maria, just 4 years old, staring into the muddy abyss. Her doll\
  \ was floating in a far corner. Without thinking, I waded forwards, hoping to bring\
  \ a glimpse of familiarity to her. Six steps, seven steps, eig... My leg disappeared.\
  \ Deeper, my body sank; the mud's appetite still yearned. Uncountable arms and spade\
  \ handles surround me clambered at my dusty mud covered skin and clothes. I was\
  \ freed. I was lucky.\n\nI watched, over my shoulder as the mud engulfed my boot\
  \ entirely. \n\nHe had won. Again. El Ni\xF1o."
