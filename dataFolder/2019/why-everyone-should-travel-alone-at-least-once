Text: "When traveling alone in Spain this past summer, I found myself on the back\
  \ of a new friend\u2019s motorcycle, zooming down the coast of Catalu\xF1a. We traced\
  \ the edges of emerald mountains, zooming past laughing children and white and blue\
  \ houses, as we chased the technicolored setting sun. As I examined the incomprehensible\
  \ beauty around me, I was finally able to feel my own humanness\u2014 my own mortality\
  \ \u2014 for the first time. But rather than feel overwhelmed by this sensation,\
  \ I felt exhilarated; aware of my ephemerality and incredibly thankful for this\
  \ time.\n\nAlthough I had traveled alone many times, I had not felt this immense\
  \ sense of relief in my own impermanence before. This kind of reflection is one\
  \ that I doubt I would have been able to make had I not been solo traveling.  Being\
  \ alone in foreign countries, disconnected from my day-to-day life, has not only\
  \ empowered me as a woman, but also given me the space and time to reflect on who\
  \ I am and who I want to be, independent of friends, family, and work.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve noticed that when I travel alone, my brain seems to function in a completely\
  \ different way than when I\u2019m back at home. New landscapes and environments\
  \ become hyper-saturated and imprinted within my memory like a 3D map, forcing me\
  \ to stay present constantly. As a solo female traveler, it is vital for me to stay\
  \ mindful of my surroundings at all times. However, I never feel burdened by this\
  \ need for ceaseless awareness\u2013 in fact, I feel thankful for it \u2014 it keeps\
  \ me present. In this way, solo traveling has acted as my own form of meditation.\n\
  \nBut of course, one of the greatest parts of traveling alone is meeting new people.\
  \ I have been so inspired by the people I\u2019ve met throughout my travels. Despite\
  \ the horror stories we hear on the news, I\u2019ve discovered that most people\
  \ around the world are truly good and many are unbelievably compassionate. Whether\
  \ in Peru, Myanmar, or Spain, people across the globe have taught me their language,\
  \ shown me their cities, and welcomed me into their homes without expecting anything\
  \ in return.   \n\nThe other day, I was telling a friend of a mine a story from\
  \ my travels. He looked at me with huge eyes and laughed, \u201COh Gillian, only\
  \ you could do that! You\u2019re so brave.\u201D But the truth is, I\u2019m actually\
  \ not that brave-- Crazy, maybe, but not brave. The most courageous part about traveling\
  \ alone for the first time is working up the guts to buy a ticket to a foreign place\
  \ where you know no one. After landing, bravery seems to a play a very little role\
  \ in traveling. The more research you do on a destination beforehand, the better\
  \ prepared you\u2019ll be to handle whatever comes your way. And even if you dive\
  \ right in without investigating, moving beyond your comfort zone and into unknown\
  \ territory will build your sense of confidence to take on new experiences with\
  \ open arms.\n\nWhen looking back at our past, we often have the strongest memories\
  \ of milestones or important events. But it\u2019s the moments where we are in solitude\
  \ \u2014 the times when we have the chance to reflect honestly and independently\
  \ \u2014 that shape us into who we are. There is no better or more meaningful time\
  \ to reflect than when traveling alone.\n\nEach time that I travel, I become more\
  \ and more confident and comfortable with myself. Learning how to be alone has been\
  \ an intrinsic part of my life, and I will take these lessons wherever I go. While\
  \ I believe that I have become more brave while traveling, I did not need bravery\
  \ to begin my journey.\n\nTraveling alone goes so far beyond seeing a different\
  \ culture; you will inevitably see a different side of yourself that would have\
  \ never been revealed to you otherwise. It is an investment in yourself: an opportunity\
  \ to learn what books cannot teach you, what pictures cannot show you, and what\
  \ friends and family cannot give you\u2013 and that is far too valuable to pass\
  \ up."
