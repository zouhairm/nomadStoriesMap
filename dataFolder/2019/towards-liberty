Text: "Growing up in urban area Dar es salaam,a coastal city found in the Eastern\
  \ of Tanzania,a little did i know of what rural life is.Hence it was in the nearing\
  \ the half of 2016,I had to travel to the village called Songambele found in the\
  \ Northern Eastern of Tanzania a region called Kigoma  for the first time  in my\
  \ teenhood.The very first time was when i was three,i went to meet my grandmother.\
  \ It was a great pleasure for me to go back to where my ancestors belong. My personal\
  \ desires were to know where we originates,who were my great great great grandparents,how\
  \ they looked like,how they lived,what did they do for living,how many kids they\
  \ had etc.\n                      The calculated flying distance from Dar es salaam\
  \ to Kigoma is equal to 1088km,and the driving distance is 1374.37km. Folks couldn't\
  \ afford to book for me a flight hence i boarded a bus which took me three days\
  \ to arrive to my destination.On my way there were much to see,the mountains,plataeus,plains,waterbodies\
  \ and the native people of each region that we passedby.\n                    On\
  \ my arrival to the village,being warmly welcomed by neighbours and my grandmother\
  \ herself,it was such  a prestige.As per custom when a guest come,the hosts slaught\
  \ an animal for the guest.I did not want much,so i requested only  hen.After all\
  \ the welcoming and stuff,I was tired and hence I needed  rest.And kept to my to\
  \ do list that i will do the exploring the following days.\n                   The\
  \ following day i stayed with my grandmother asking her about my ancestors,when\
  \ did her husband die and other questions of similar kind.The life here was not\
  \ that pleasing!People lived in poverty,no electrictity in majority  number of households,only\
  \ some that they were somehow good financially managed to afford solar panels atleast\
  \ to light up the night.The water was not 24/7 available and was not safe either.\
  \ Many kids dropped out of school because of distance,hunger,uncomfortable school\
  \ environment for them to learn that is they seated down on the dusty floor,the\
  \ blackboard as not in good condition,some even learned under the trees.In other\
  \ words poverty played a major part in school drop out,parents could not fford to\
  \ buy the kids uniform and shoes,some didn't go to school at all,some went with\
  \ the torn one shoeless,with brothers and sisters escaping to urban and the parents\
  \ weak and old,the kids needed to do the farm work to afford food for the family.\n\
  \                 With those mentioned above problems and a lot other more that\
  \ i did not expect to find,I found my purpose in life that  i didn't have before\
  \ and i did not expect to find it there.So came  a thought of TOWARDS LIBERTY, a\
  \ non-governmental organization that aims to free people from poverty,bringing them\
  \ into liberation,free from ignorance,diseases and poverty.\n                  Despite\
  \ all i enjoyed the  hospitility of the natives and my grandmother's old tales.\
  \ After a week i went back home to parents with alot of gifts from grandmother to\
  \ them. Promising my self that i will study hard and finally mke my dream come true."
