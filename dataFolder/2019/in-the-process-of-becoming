Text: 'Travel for me is not just seeing happier places and appreciating beauty but
  rather a journey of my own growing, understanding and becoming free and letting
  things go.To all the places I have been, have taught me something new which I will
  cherish all through my life.The one thing I have learnt while traveling is when
  you travel itself, there will be a lot of blocks for you to go further and things
  will never work out the way you have planned. It''s always about what you have got
  in present and making the best out of it with what you have got and not to forget
  to enjoy all those moments which could never come back to you again.Life is exactly
  the same.The only difference is that this journey will never end until you die.

  I have travelled places with my family, friends, gone on trio,duo and solo trips.Each
  trip has been a different experience for me.My solo trips has been the most enlightening
  ones. One could get amazed as to how your senses work when you travel alone.You
  tend to notice every minute details around you and appreciate the smallest of smallest
  things.The people around the world can be so homely and helpful that they will give
  you new hopes in your life.

  Traveling is also about opening up and going out of your comfort zone. It''s about
  taking risks and giving a chance to yourself. There''s never a right time to take
  off for your peace of mind.The whole process creates and builds a personality. I
  keep growing everyday. I learn something everyday. I not only help myself but I
  help others in their becoming.

  That''s my travel story.'
