Text: "Sunrise and Sunset had always appeared serene from any angle but never have\
  \ I ever observed both so red and divine. Colli di Fontanelle is a town located\
  \ on top of Sorrento peninsula whose name is derived from the dozens of water springs\
  \ that were once there in ancient times. \n    From my childhood I have always been\
  \ attracted to the natural beauty and originality of everything that surrounds us,\
  \ so my brother on our last trip in Italy brought us to Sorrento \u2013 a present\
  \ for my twenty-first birthday. We reached Sorrento by ferry since it takes way\
  \ too long by trains from Napoli. As we got down at the port of Sorrento, I got\
  \ to see the beautiful town from outside. It already became my favourite destination\
  \ as soon as I laid my eyes upon it. As we took the bus, the adventure through the\
  \ unknown town began. It was my first time away from India and in India we are not\
  \ allowed to go alone to unknown places, especially if we are girls. It felt good\
  \ as we were going up and up to the top of the town. Still the best part of any\
  \ tour is finding the way to the destination and while doing so, connecting with\
  \ the local people and the locality; it suddenly makes us feel that we are part\
  \ of it. The people were so kind and helpful that in no time we found our way to\
  \ the extreme end of Colli di Fontanelle and also the grocery shop and restaurants\
  \ close-by. \nThe apartment was situated on top of a cliff and at the edge of Colli\
  \ di Fontanelle. It was actually the last apartment in that locality after which\
  \ it was a steep fall. It felt like someone picked me up from crowded busy road\
  \ with horns of cars, buses and trains and the usual cacophony of everyday life\
  \ and hid me at the extreme end where none of those white noises can cause a head-ache.\
  \ \n                            \nI tried to capture as much serenity as possible\
  \ through the lens of the camera but it wasn\u2019t enough. It\u2019s never enough\
  \ capturing nature through camera; moments does seem more than enough and makes\
  \ us feel nostalgic at times but nature is best captured through eyes- the smell,\
  \ the sound of the surrounding and the breeze together with it makes places all\
  \ the way more memorable. \nWe stayed there for three nights and two days and during\
  \ the time span, it kind of felt like home- maybe mainly because we were cooking\
  \ for ourselves and going out for strolls anytime we wanted. We even tried to find\
  \ every kind of spices we Indians need- to survive(:-D) and we were almost successful\
  \ at that but we couldn\u2019t find turmeric(:-( ).\nThe tours from Sorrento to\
  \ Pompeii and Capri were wonderful in different ways and I did feel at the top of\
  \ the world just standing at the top edge of the cruise as we sailed to Capri. Every\
  \ time there was a wave, I felt like flying and it was the best experience I have\
  \ so far. Surrounded by clear blue water and the briny, damped smell of the sea\
  \ filling my lungs \u2013 it was like every inch of my body was finally alive. Pompeii\
  \ on the other hand made me feel sad and shocked with the history. The volcanic\
  \ eruption in 79 A.D. was itself so spine-chilling and after visiting Pompeii, when\
  \ I learnt that it wasn\u2019t the first time Pompeii was covered under ash and\
  \ molten lava and that only twenty-five percent of the mysteries have been solved,\
  \ I felt both thrilled and devastated. Still when we came to our apartment from\
  \ the long exciting tours, those silent moments sitting at top of a cliff with comfy\
  \ clothes and watching sunset with family was as relaxing to eyes as to the mind.\
  \ It was hard waking up early mornings just to enjoy the sunrise but the tranquility\
  \ was always worth it."
