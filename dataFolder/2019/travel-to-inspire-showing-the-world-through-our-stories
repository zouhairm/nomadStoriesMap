Text: "My name is Yenifer Mu\xF1oz, law student and Colombian traveler. I started\
  \ traveling alone when I turned eighteen and since that day I have not been able\
  \ to stop.\nBe a young woman travelling alone has taught me many perspectives of\
  \ the world and life, I always remember the longing that I felt the first time I\
  \ crossed the international borders of my country and embarked me on unknown paths\
  \ and cultures, that experience showed me what freedom is and made me experiment\
  \ an inspiring sensation, then I decided that I would travel with a purpose, which\
  \ over the years I have been building and strengthening through my writing. I want\
  \ to teach women that traveling alone is possible, that our soul is capable of fighting\
  \ against the dangers of the world and that nobody can stop us from reaching our\
  \ goals more than ourselves. \nI want to demonstrate that it's possible travel and\
  \ have a successful career and family relationship, it doesn\u2019t exist only one\
  \ way to carry out our life plans, all woman has to know that being brave we can\
  \ lead success and live in our way. I have learned that travel is possible having\
  \ a career and a family through the many wonderful people I have met in my travels\
  \ and who have shown me that no matter what culture or religion we have, if we are\
  \ alone or accompanied, our personal plans don\u2019t have to be separated to discover\
  \ the world.\nOthers must know that regardless our origin, the world is made for\
  \ everyone and even more today, when we have the opportunity to be so connected.\
  \ All of us should have the chance to know new places, know the stories of people\
  \ and write our experiences, because that could make us build a better world in\
  \ which we forget the differences that have divided us and learnt that no matter\
  \ where, our feelings are the same, young, old, women or men all have the same desires\
  \ and sometimes the same fears, but them cannot make us stop.\nAnd at the end the\
  \ memories that we make in each trip are the most precious, for me the most beautiful\
  \ thing I have are those memories running between the majestic constructions of\
  \ the historic center of Mexico City with wet soil and hair in the wind; the memories\
  \ walking among the cobblestone labyrinths of the streets in Cuzco while I saw the\
  \ lights of the city that at the distance told me the history of the Inca culture;\
  \ the memories of my first arrival in Europe and the excitement I felt speaking\
  \ a new language or not recognizing any one while I was at the airport; the memories\
  \ walking through the beautiful streets of Porto while winter hugged me and my heart\
  \ asked a lot of questions, which were answered every step of the way, showing me\
  \ how beautiful life is, how wonderful the world is and how transformative a travel\
  \ could be for the people.\nThat is why traveling with a purpose is even more exciting,\
  \ is and adventure that becomes in a career in which cultures come together under\
  \ a single message, we must discover who we are and enjoy life, because it goes\
  \ away and does not return, but it lasts in each travel and in each person we can\
  \ inspire."
