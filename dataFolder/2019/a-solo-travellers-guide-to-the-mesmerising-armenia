Text: "I sat on the window side of airarabia flight  petrified wondering what the\
  \ country had for a solo traveller and how safe it was or how the people were and\
  \ how my first ever solo trip was going to be bla..bla.. bla.\nMy head just didn't\
  \ seem to stop thinking.\n\nThe flight landed and first hit of cold chilling wind\
  \ on my face was one of the warmest welcome.\n\nI realised I was going to be frozen\
  \ for next few days and thats exactly what I was looking forward to as the temperatures\
  \ were reaching -7 during the season.\n\nAirport was just 15 minutes road trip to\
  \ my hotel at the capital city Yerevan .\nThe capital has many historical attractions\
  \ ,Republic square and museums,has beautiful tiny cafes and flea market for cheap\
  \ bargains of souvenirs.\n\nDay 2, I explored the town of tsakadzor, the beautiful\
  \ tsakadzor ski resort is the ideal spot for snow sports lovers just half an hour\
  \ from yerevan\n\nDay 3, visited the beautiful lake Sevan ,one of the most picturesque\
  \ location in armenia.\nMust try the fresh water fish cooked in auhenitic armenian\
  \ style , \nNext wad thr Garni temple , it is a pagan temple and one of the oldest\
  \ temples.\n\nDay 4 : visited the world's oldest winery and the khor virap church.which\

  \ history , interesting facts to explore and beautiful weather to chill .\n\nVALUE\
  \ FOR MONEY : it's a very economical country for budget travellers . \n1 USD is\

  \ in yerevan and Shirak international airport in Gyumri\nBy Train , a 10 hour train\
  \ ride is available from Georgia \nBy bus , there are many buses running from Iran\
  \ and Georgia to Yerevan\n\nVISA : it's on arrival/No visa to most countries. On\
