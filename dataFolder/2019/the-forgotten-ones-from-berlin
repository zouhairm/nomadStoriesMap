Text: "This is my first time ever traveling just by myself somewhere outside of my\
  \ country. I decided to visit as many cities of Germany as possible, and I had such\
  \ an incredible time drinking gluhwein and visiting the Christmas Markets. However,\
  \ after a couple of weeks there I felt that something has been missing.\nI had the\
  \ pleasant surprise of finding out that one of my friends also happened to be in\
  \ Germany, and was going to spend a couple of nights in Berlin. I took the earliest\
  \ train on the next day and went looking for adventure. \nBerlin looks just as beautiful\
  \ as it does in the pictures: many tourists around, beautiful landmarks that reflect\
  \ the history of this place, fancy restaurants, luxury hotels and malls, everything\
  \ that a big metropolis such as this one could ever possibly have. \nWe went to\
  \ a Christmas Market, as I told my friend he needed to go. I made him try their\
  \ famous sausages, currywurst, pretzels covered in cheese, we drank so much gluhwein\
  \ and tried pretty much everything we could find. We discovered that there is a\
  \ Volkswagen Caf\xE9 and a Microsoft Caf\xE9, we were absolutely spoiled. \nAfter\
  \ 9 hours walking and only taking small breaks, we started to feel a little bit\
  \ tired. Especially since we had the purpose of never using the tram or the train\
  \ unless it was absolutely necessary so we can get to know EVERYTHING. \nEven though\
  \ we were tired, we wanted to enjoy the nightlife of Berlin: to go clubbing, drinking\
  \ and meeting new people in a foreign country sounded like something we really needed\
  \ to do.\nBut then, my friend had the best idea. He told me we should walk all the\
  \ way back to the hostel but not through the famous and busy streets, this time\
  \ we will get to know the actual and real Berlin. \nAt this time, we did not have\
  \ much money left and all of our stuff was safe back at the hostel, so we though\
  \ \u201Cyeah, why not?\u201D. I will never regret this decision. \nWithout even\
  \ noticing we were already in the ghetto of Berlin, we looked around and everything\
  \ was so different. There were no lights anymore, no more Christmas Markets, not\
  \ any Gucci stores and not a living soul around. There was one sex worker standing\
  \ every five steps, I looked at their heels and they seemed worn-out, and their\
  \ tight clothes could never be useful at a -10\xB0 C weather. \nSex shops were already\
  \ closed, that\u2019s pretty much everything there was. We could clearly hear drunken\
  \ males yelling five blocks away. As we kept walking, we noticed that people started\
  \ staring and looking directly to us in the eye. A male wearing a hoodie started\
  \ following us, so we walked fast until we got someplace else. \nWhen we reached\
  \ back to the lights, we discovered we were only a block away from the touristic\
  \ area. \nThis reminded me of my trip to Las Vegas with my dad. Pictures on Instagram\
  \ portray an incredible nightlife, casinos, fancy stores, luxury hotels, everything.\
  \ However, outside of those four or five blocks covered by those ridiculously big\
  \ hotels, you can find the forgotten ones from Las Vegas. \nI love sharing this\
  \ kind of stories because it gave me a whole new perspective on life. I truly believe\
  \ everyone needs to experience this. Sometimes to make a difference in this world,\
  \ we need a little push and experience the problem firsthand. I will never leave\
  \ behind the forgotten ones from Berlin."
