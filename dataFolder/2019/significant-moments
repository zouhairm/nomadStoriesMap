Text: "I stopped walking as soon as I saw two elderly ladies dramatically waving at\
  \ me from a distance. Babushka, I thought. It meant 'old lady' in the Russian language\
  \ and was one of the few Russian words I had painstakingly memorized just recently.\
  \ Standing in the renowned Palace Square of St. Petersburg, a city born out of the\
  \ vision of Peter the Great in early 18th century, surrounded by grand monuments\
  \ that stood as glorious reflections of history, made one feel like a tiny speck\
  \ in a city that seemed to be an unmatched reflection of imperial might. The bronze\
  \ colored Alexander Column that I was standing next to, stood tall as a powerful\
  \ symbol of military strength that was made after the Russian victory against Napoleon's\
  \ France. On its pedestal were various depictions of military power and victory.\
  \ My thought process, which influenced by present surroundings contained existentialist\
  \ notions of inevitable insignificance, was interrupted by these two elderly women\
  \ who were walking towards me with an unapologetic display of enthusiasm, conveyed\
  \ by their warm smiles and hand gestures, coupled with certain sentences in Russian,\
  \ of which I didn\u2019t understand a word. I assumed they needed directions, and\
  \ humored myself at the thought that in all of St. Petersburg they had approached\
  \ the one person who was incapable of giving proper directions even in her own city,\
  \ let alone a foreign city she had reached the previous afternoon.\n\nThe women\
  \ had wrinkles that formed on the side of their eyes. They were wearing gown-like\
  \ dresses, almost alike in style, carrying colorful umbrellas in one hand and their\
  \ bags in the other. One of them had a faded scarf around her neck and walked with\
  \ a slight stoop. What was most noticeable, however, was their sheer excitement.\
  \ All of a sudden, after uttering a few phrases in fluent Russian, one of them said\
  \ a sentence in Hindi. No, she sang it. It was a line from an old Hindi song that\
  \ was still widely popular in India \u2013 a song that not only my generation back\
  \ home in India knew, but also two generations immediately before us, at the very\
  \ least. The line in the song, \u2018sarr pe laal topi Rusi\u2019, meaning \u2018\
  the red hat on my head is Russian\u2019 was often interpreted as a cultural reflection\
  \ of Indo-Soviet ties, till a few decades back. As children we had all sung it without\
  \ a care in the world, and somehow, standing on the cobblestones of Palace Square,\
  \ I was reminded of this song again, by none other than two elderly Russian ladies.\
  \ Although they couldn\u2019t speak a word in English, and I had clearly failed\
  \ at speaking a sentence in Russian that made sense to them, all three of us made\
  \ an attempt to communicate. I knew what they were trying to tell me, more through\
  \ their gestures than sentences. Their kind smiles while attempting to sing the\
  \ song to me, swaying a little with the beat, were heartwarming. The warmth in their\
  \ eyes probably hid years of experience and history, of learning and unlearning.\
  \ In that moment, I wanted to ask them how they knew this song and why it was evidently\
  \ so special to them that they would wave to me, a stranger. But I didn\u2019t.\
  \ If someone had told me on the afternoon I reached St. Petersburg that two women\
  \ would sing to me a song from my childhood, in the middle of Palace Square, I would\
  \ have laughed at the absurdity of the statement. Instead, now I was laughing with\
  \ them at the joy, as also the randomness, of this meeting. \n\nThis chance encounter\
  \ barely lasted two minutes, but definitely made a lasting impression. As I discovered\
  \ on that journey, St. Petersburg has many beautiful sights to its credit. However,\
  \ now I also know that somewhere in the city are two lovely ladies who take pride\
  \ in remembering a shared cultural history that connects them to somebody like me,\
  \ miles away. Maybe this was the purpose of travel after all. Maybe it was supposed\
  \ to surprise you and show you the significance of moments otherwise deemed insignificant."
