Text: "Catching a cab is a game. It begins with two players bound to travel together.\
  \ Locked in a war of words, the only way to win is to zip your lips.\n\nA world\
  \ of silence snarled in the cab. Two strangers, with nothing in common apart from\
  \ a raging ocean of hunger to reach the destination, looked in opposite directions.\n\
  \n\u201CI don\u2019t see the red light you are seeing, Bhaiya,\u201D I joked only\
  \ to find my cab driver going slower than before. Running late to places is a skill\
  \ I excel at, but what good could it do while rushing to catch a flight?\n\nIt is\
  \ no mystery that he was milking the fare, and in Delhi, this meant a lost fortune\
  \ which could have been spent on a good dinner. My thoughts were interrupted by\
  \ his odour that mostly reeked of cheap beer. \n\n\u201CCan you drive faster? I\
  \ need to reach in three minutes or you\u2019re paying for my missed flight,\u201D\
  \ I angrily blurted out.\n\nGlancing back, he abruptly stopped the car. \u201CMadam,\
  \ a girl is only good as long as she keeps her mouth shut and skirt open,\u201D\
  \ he remarked. It felt as if his eyes had scanned every inch of my body in that\
  \ split second.\n\nA stroke of panic hit me right in the chest. I took out three\
  \ crisp notes from my purse and told him to drive ahead. His eyes rolled between\
  \ my face and the money in my hand. He moved his fingers and my knees trembled.\
  \ Grasping my hand, he snatched the money and finally got behind the steering wheel.\n\
  \nI never dared to book another cab alone. Sadly, I could not enjoy that luxury\
  \ for long.\n\nFinding myself alone on a journey in Shillong, I hesitantly peeped\
  \ in one of the cabs and asked the frail man sitting inside if he would take me\
  \ to Dawki. His solitary face brightened up. \n\nThe post-trauma clenched my throat.\
  \ I mumbled words in fear of losing a hefty sum of money and my peace of mind. To\
  \ my surprise, he asked only half the amount I had in mind. \u201CDid he even get\
  \ the exact destination we would be headed to?\u201D I thought to myself and smiled.\n\
  \nThe next morning, a long drive dunked in silence began. My hopes were crushed\
  \ when he introduced himself as Krishna. \u201CI moved from Nepal to North East\
  \ India about 15 years ago,\u201D he started telling me. Scared to make conversation,\
  \ I buttoned up my mouth.\n\nI leaned onto the passenger seat and was rescued by\
  \ the magical world swaddled with sundry shades of skies and floating clouds. After\
  \ a three-hour drive, the little town came into sight. Colourful, crooked huts stood\
  \ at almost every meandering turn, welcoming passers-by with a whiff of warmth.\n\
  \nThe sun soon sailed downwards and I told him to rush to the Umngot River. \u201C\
  My wife really loves the fish pickle they sell near the border. I really wanted\
  \ to get it. Do you mind?\u201D he asked. \u201COf course not,\u201D I said.\n\n\
  The saffron flare burst into purple and pink, reflecting in the stretches of water.\
  \ The boatman took us afar and instantly diverted the direction from where the river\
  \ flowed into Bangladesh. \u201CDid people ask the river before slicing it up into\
  \ two?\u201D I wondered. As he rowed back, I rollicked away like a paper boat sailing\
  \ with the stream while the town immersed in darkness. \n\n\u201CIt is already dusk.\
  \ I won\u2019t be able to surprise her.\u201D Krishna said as soon as I got back.\
  \ \u201CBut, she understands\u2026 Women understand,\u201D he sighed.\n\n\u201C\
  Being a girl is a blessing here, do you know? If the father dies, it is the daughters\
  \ who inherit his property, not the sons. And the boys have to live with the girl\u2019\
  s family after marriage.\u201D\n\nI shot him a glance.\n\n\u201CI want to be a girl\
  \ in my next birth,\u201D he chuckled.\n\nI said nothing.\n\nMy heart caught the\
  \ beat of silence again. His words healed the horror of the recent past. I wanted\
  \ to break away from the noise of no words. For the first time, I felt I could win\
  \ the game with unzipped lips."
