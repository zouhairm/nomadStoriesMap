Text: "People have many many reasons to visit Portugal, whether it is to get to  know\
  \ the history, taste the astonishing  food and outrageous wines or understand the\
  \ culture. But besides all those amazing things I've just described, I think that\
  \ the reason that makes Portugal a unique place in the whole world, is the outcomes\
  \ that it has, and it reduces to the reason why I embrace the will to be able to\
  \ know Portugal. Portugal is a country full of contradictions, the old and new are\
  \ living side by side. The country has beautiful and old and new buildings.The old\
  \ buildings and the massive castles host curiosity on a explorer's eyes and mind,\
  \ more than 400 castles present at the country tell about its history  on a different\
  \ way, starting from  religion to politics, for example. Portugal also has, at the\
  \ same time, such a new live environment and constructions that follow the world's\
  \ trends on renewing and innovating without losing its cultural worth. Furthermore,\
  \ let's acknowledge that the best views out there are not only at the top of both\
  \ new and old buildings, as long as we're capable of finding the right sights to\
  \ aim amongst everything else presented by the world, and at along the coast line\
  \ of the country, specially on the south part, like Algarve, you can  find the most\
  \ amazing views even money cannot buy. On the other hand, the country doesn't hold\
  \ contradictions on its own, people do carry them too. Most of the Portuguese population\
  \ is old and Christian (mostly are a part of Catholicism), and although the youth\
  \ do not represent the most of their faith, there are still people ( especially\
  \ the elderly ) who maintain the tradition of  going to church every single Sunday\
  \ and you still see  in the same country youngsters who are willing to conquer the\
  \ world, having fun and living the most out of it, whether  it is attending big\
  \ concerts of world wide international artists like Bruno Mars on arenas or being\
  \ lucky enough to have a coffee at the same place as Madonna,  or even  win the\
  \ lottery to actually bump into football stars like Cristiano Ronald. \nTo end,\
  \  I will add up the fact that although  Portugal is a small country, its beauty\
  \ can not just been seen by bare eyes, we need to let our soul embrace everything\
  \ that comes along that beautiful place, starting from the old buildings of Lisbon\
  \ going to the north on the old city of Braga, finding your way to the oldest European\
  \ university in Coimbra, not forgetting the vineyards through Douro river in Porto\
  \ and ending in the beautiful rock and rich beaches in Algarve."
