Text: "For years I din't have holidays. I was working with theater company, earning\
  \ very small money. To pay my rent I used to have one or two jobs more. So, after\
  \ leaving Warsaw and quitting my company I discovered...holidays. In the age of\
  \ 27! And I got addicted easily. Finding a flight, booking, quick research about\
  \ the place you fly to, writing to do list, then flying, landing and meeting unexpected\
  \ with your to do list in your pocket (break the rules!).\nIn January 2019 I went\
  \ to Sicily, Catania. A city of a big elephant sculpture, spectacular churches,\
  \ black rocks, dangerous and mesmerizing Etna volcano. And my couch. The man who\
  \ shared with me one of the most fascinating stories I've ever heard. Earth is empty\
  \ inside and there is a civilization living there. I was even asked if I want to\
  \ try to get inside. I am not easy with commitments though ;)\nCatania with its\
  \ beauty, good food (*Sicilian food deserves a chapeaux bas in this moment: pizza\
  \ with pistachio and arancini! <3 ), friendly people and amazing caves which are\
  \ so easy to access was a bit depressing. That's why decided to open the map and\
  \ choose a place not far from Catania but far enough to be not 'Catania-like'. Siracusa!\
  \ Here I am. I found the place on the map which will make be being the closest to\
  \ Africa ever.\nAnd I decided to walk exactly there. Such a different experience.\
  \ From very first moment I experienced something so strong and alive. Sunday was\
  \ a risky choice because of amount of tourists there all going with the big wave\
  \ to Isola di Ortigia - place, where all the treasures of Siracusa are placed next\
  \ to each other. Thanks to small and charming streets I was able to avoid crowds\
  \ and walk a bit more calmly. From the very moment I fell in love with magical and\
  \ old spirit of Sircausa. Apollo's Temple, Diana's fountain, palace of Archimedes,\
  \ old puppet theater. You literally walk on the history which you learned in primary\
  \ school. What is amazing is also the mixture of things - cultural, religious and\
  \ historical.  You can visit ancient Greek theater, ruins of Apollo's temple and\
  \ incredible beauty of architecture. I was also surprised how much this place is\
  \ open for tourists and there was no problem with communicating in English. After\
  \ inhaling history I rested on a small 'beach' which I found under city's wall.\
  \ Looking and Mediterranian Sea playful waves, shamelessly blue sky, sitting there\
  \ with t-shirt without shoes in the middle of January (such a surprise for Polish\
  \ person ;) ) I literally felt Africa just a few steps from me. I don't know if\
  \ it's true that I have never been so close to Africa. But this day I was closest\
  \ to my internal explorer than ever. \nAfter eating my last (vegan!) arancino and\
  \ having last glass of Sicilian red wine I came back to airport. For the goodbye\
  \ Etna showed herself. Massive, beautiful and proud. \nTo really taste Sicily you\
  \ must travel all around and spend much more time there. This place has some sort\
  \ of magic.\nPizza with pistachio, can you imagine?!"
