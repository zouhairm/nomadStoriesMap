Text: "I put my bags down in an empty room and walked out the door into the streets\
  \ of Balham, looked left, looked right, and walked. I didn\u2019t take much in,\
  \ but I was certainly moving. This, moving without purpose, would be an on-going\
  \ theme throughout my time in the city, as I became desperate to fill the days .\
  \ Before London, I had enough acquaintances to distract me from the fact that I\
  \ had no real friends.  But now I wanted them. I wanted people to worry about, and\
  \ to celebrate. I knew I wouldn\u2019t meet them sitting at home, so I made a rule\
  \ to leave the house by 9am and not return until midnight. But I grew bored of looking\
  \ at exhibitions without seeing them, of being surrounded by innovation but taking\
  \ no notice of it. Of climbing the stairs in every Zara, which must boast a ratio\
  \ of one-store-per-person, without purpose. \n\nI joined a Leisure Centre and booked\
  \ myself into a spin class, an activity that is essentially cycling for the insane.\
  \  \n\nA loud, six-foot, Caribbean-born instructor named Patrick stood out in this\
  \ city of people with lowered heads. His insistence on being poured into lycra,\
  \ despite the protestations of his physique was a poor advertisement for spin. He\
  \ also sported an exceptional pair of lungs, which he saw fit to employ far more\
  \ than his legs; other instructors peddled hard alongside their class. Patrick,\
  \ however, stood beside the sound-system singing along to his Urban remixes.  I\
  \ found this infuriating. Except when I felt okay about myself. \n\nI was angry\
  \ with him for starting late and finishing early. I was apoplectic at his habit\
  \ of asking me questions so that he could answer them. But I didn\u2019t let my\
  \ frustration at his poor work ethic or self-absorption effect the way I spoke to\
  \ him: I remained curious about his life, concerned for his wellbeing.  I became\
  \ a spin obsessive. Unofficially, I had my own bike, and on the occasion an unknowing\
  \ fool would take my spot, Patrick would cheekily suggest the infidel try a different\
  \ cycle.  I suppose was a friend to this ball of energy wrapped in unforgiving lycra.\
  \ \n\nPatrick was one of many forced out of their homes after the Grenfell Tower\
  \ fire. He did not wait long to be re-housed, but the accommodation was a distance\
  \ from the gym, which rendered him later than usual to classes. He lamented his\
  \ job, bureaucracy, politics etc but gone was his former sassy pride at being the\
  \ subject of complaints, at being misunderstood.  He was now going through the motions.\
  \ He was climbing the stairs of Zara. He sang less. He was grumpy. He sat on the\
  \ bike as though he couldn\u2019t even be bothered standing anymore. He barked instructions\
  \ and singled-out people to chide. His change was understandable, although he would\
  \ never consider it was due to the trauma of being rehoused. It was simply \u2018\
  Leisure Centre management\u2019.  \n\nEventually, he received more accessible accommodation.\
  \ He began laughing again, mainly about the paperwork he\u2019d handed in late.\
  \   He asked how I was, and told me about his day before I could respond.  I managed\
  \ to interject that I was on edge, as it was likely id be booted out of the country\
  \ soon. He said he\u2019d marry me so I could get a visa. I laughed as though that\
  \ wasn\u2019t the joke everyone made. There was no point truly venting. It was clear\
  \ that, once again, he wasn\u2019t hearing me. But he was happy. And I was happy\
  \ that he was himself again. \n\nWhen I left London, he was his old self, and I\
  \ would gladly be tucked into bed by 10pm without feeling a failure.  Patrick never\
  \ learned to listen, too concerned with singing loudly over the sweating, hard-working\
  \ cyclists, but there was something about his well-meaning narcissism that was actually\
  \ helpful, and of great comfort to me.  I\u2019m still not sure what he represented,\
  \ but perhaps having his ear, however superficial, was enough. It was certainly\
  \ a step in the right direction."
