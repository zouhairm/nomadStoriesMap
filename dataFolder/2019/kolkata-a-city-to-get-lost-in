Text: "The paan shops dominated the street corners, perched with cigarette packets,\
  \ kulhars (clay cups) which they suggest are nothing like the kulhars of the north\
  \ since the soil of Calcutta is different, a sip into the tea and you can't help\
  \ but believe them. Those hand pulled rickshaws still roaming on the streets like\
  \ nothing has changed in last 30 years. Those yellow taxis or 'Ambi' as it is fondly\
  \ called was the first thing that greeted me to Calcutta. I made it a point to ride\
  \ in it all the way. It is cheap and a testament to everything this city is, fighting\
  \ against the time, as if holding on to a thread from the days of the past. This\
  \ thread through, is as real as what they say about this city. \n\nWhen I was a\
  \ kid my mom told me about Trams, a rail vehicle that runs along the street on a\
  \ track and she showed me a picture of it. I was so wonderstruck by the description\
  \ of them, I could not believe they were real, the first time my mother took me\
  \ to Delhi I asked her if there were Trams here too, I don't know if she remembers.\
  \ One should have seen the childish joy with which the 26 year old me almost jumped\
  \ out of the taxi when I finally saw the Tram for the first time on my way to Esplande.\
  \ Which is supposed to be the posh side of the town, where the english resided at\
  \ one time in history. \"They're still running these trams, it is nuisance\" the\
  \ driver says and in the moment I wish I could tell him how it's been years since\
  \ I jumped out of joy like that.\n\nI don't understand Bengali but somehow while\
  \ writing, I end up listening to Rabindra Sangeet. I feel language when spoken is\
  \ nothing but the vibrations of the words, the melody of them. At Jorasanko in Rabindranath\
  \ Tagores home, Tagore was the greatest, nobel prize winning Indian poet. I made\
  \ sure I touched everything he might once have touched, his chair, those railings,\
  \ that floor as his songs played in the background. In the end I just ended up sitting\
  \ cross legged on the floor to absorb everything. I wanted to cry my hearts out\
  \ I did cry a little. It is an eerie thing to admit, the crying bit. I don't know\
  \ why I let those tears out, maybe it was out of the desire, wanting everything\
  \ he had, this poet, this writer, this god. Maybe I cried knowing I might never\
  \ have this, yet I get to experience what it might have been like for a bit.  It\
  \ was so surreal, those vast open hallways, those airy rooms, those nooks and corners.\
  \ Now that I am back I still can't believe I was there. I felt what I felt.\n\n\
  I remember while growing up I used to look at Delhi like someplace I could get lost\
  \ in. A comforting feeling for someone from a small town. I remember that feeling\
  \ like I remember to sleep. I never feel like that anymore, it's been years since\
  \ I have been living in Delhi. Kind of how I don't feel butterflies of love in my\
  \ stomach anymore. \n\nBut after years I felt the same way about a city. I found\
  \ something I didn't expect to find, a feeling that I could get lost somewhere.\
  \ Maybe I still can get lost in the hustle of a city, maybe I still can feel those\
  \ butterflies in my stomach. She asks me why did you click the city devoid of colours.\
  \ I tell her, that's how this city seemed to me, devoid of colours. Like you imagine\
  \ history in your mind. Calcutta is history fighting for its place in the modern\
  \ world.\n\nI want to spend a summer in Calcutta, maybe I will."
