Text: "My first travel experience can be summed up in two words terrifyingly wonderful.\
  \ I was 16 years old and it was the first time traveling without my parents. A high\
  \ school teacher was taking a group of students to the small country of Belize.\
  \ The overview of the trip stated \"pack light, be ready for a new experience and\
  \ be ready to immerse yourself into local culture.\" I'm used to being a tourist\
  \ on my vacations not being part of the culture. I didn't know what to expect, where\
  \ we going to be with local people, are they dangerous, will they hurt us, what\
  \ happens if we walk in the wrong neighborhood, will the local cops try to shake\
  \ us down. Every bad thought you hear from other people and tv ran through my mind.\
  \ Nothing could have been further from the truth.\n  Our first hotel was two hours\
  \ outside Belize City only 45 minutes of that were on paved roads. We drove through\
  \ shallow rivers up and down narrow dirt roads and even stopped and helped a family\
  \ change their tire. We arrived at the hotel after dark they gave us our room assignments\
  \ girls in one guys in the other. I walked into the thatched roof three bed room\
  \ home with each bed with a mosquito net. The bed I picked happened to have a scorpion\
  \ on the inside of the net it took three people and two glass jars to capture the\
  \ scorpion. That night I didn't sleep well thinking what else could be in the bed\
  \ and I was for sure I felt 100 bugs crawling on my body all night long, needless\
  \ to say I was not feeling good about my choice coming on the trip. \n  The next\
  \ morning I woke up, checking my entire body for bugs that will kill me with one\
  \ bite. I was the first person up so I walked over to the cub house for breakfast.\
  \ Looking behind the clubhouse I saw why my teacher had picked this hotel. 125 feet\
  \ down there was a natural pool with about six 25 foot cliffs where five rivers\
  \ converge into one pool that tired a flowed into three smaller pools then flowed\
  \ into a bigger natural pool. The resort was called Five Sisters Belize. I have\
  \ never seen anything so wonderfully beautiful in my life and I realized if I would\
  \ have gone the way of the typical tourist I would have never seen something so\
  \ beautiful. That was the start of a trip I will never forget. As a group we had\
  \ a local guide for the week he showed us around Belize including shopping in the\
  \ market, several Mayan ruins including canoeing into a cave where the Mayan performed\
  \ sacrifices, and a howler monkey sanctuary. \n The trip I took when I was 16 changed\
  \ the way I have traveled the rest of my life. I wanted to immerse myself into every\
  \ culture I went to visit that could be traveling over seas or even right here in\
  \ my own country. I firmly believe that's the best way to learn something new. It\
  \ might be scary and it might become uncomfortable at times but you will feel better\
  \ about yourself and you will learn something about yourself and another culture\
  \ if you open your mind when traveling. That first step can be the scariest but\
  \ if you open your mind I guarantee the last step back on the plane will be the\
  \ hardest because you will not want to go back home."
