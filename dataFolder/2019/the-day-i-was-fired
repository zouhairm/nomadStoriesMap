Text: "22nd Jan 2019, the day all my dreams shattered. All I remember was being called\
  \ into a cabin and being told that I was fired. I wanted to come out gracefully.\
  \ I thanked the person who shared such heart breaking news to me, deleted my information\
  \ from the laptop, handed over the laptop to the exit team and walked out of office\
  \ with elegance. The moment I stepped out, I saw my boyfriend who was waiting to\
  \ take me home. I said nothing, what can I say? I was in the state of shock, I'm\
  \ a 30 year old looking for stability in life and in India we believe that it's\
  \ the age where all the girls will be settled with a loving family and kids, I know\
  \ a handful of my friends who've been in that state. Through out the way, I said\
  \ nothing, I was in the state of shock where after 2.5 years of flawless service,\
  \ the organization asked me to leave, just like that! \n\nI burst into tears once\
  \ I reached home, cried my lungs out. Then, suddenly I didn't know what to do. My\
  \ partner asked me if I want to travel, this time I didn't have a reason to say\
  \ 'no'. We booked the tickets, packed our bags and in the next two hours we were\
  \ on our way to Goa. Since the time I was a teenager, I wanted to visit Goa, but\
  \ then my parents were against it and once I started working I never had a chance\
  \ to take a break and travel for pleasure. \n\nThrough out the night I couldn't\
  \ sleep, the horror of joblessness haunted me big time. Around 9 AM, we reached\
  \ arambul beach, I felt nothing, all I was doing was to blindly follow my partner\
  \ reluctantly. Suddenly, I realized the slipping cold sand under my feet, the gentle\
  \ sea breeze that touched my waves to the rhythm of the sea waves I was listening.\
  \ I saw the ocean, for the first time in my life, so close that I cried out of joy.\
  \ We've stayed there for 5 days, hired a bike, had too many cheese naans (cheese\
  \ flat breads), toured throughout the place with a short and a tee (I'm sure I'd\
  \ not have done it anywhere else), played with the sea water that cleansed my body,\
  \ watched the incredible sunsets on the beach that purified my soul, of course,\
  \ had ample amount of wine that cleansed my palate and slept on the beach under\
  \ the moon, looking at the sky and gazing at the stars that illuminated like a zillion\
  \ diamonds in the vast universe! \n\nThrough out my stay in Goa, I found something\
  \ that I didn't expect to find, I found the girl who had gone through ups and downs\
  \ in her life, I found the girl who was fearless, I found the girl who fought like\
  \ a Valkyrie, I found the girl who made mistakes and learned through them, I found\
  \ the girl who evolved into the woman she is today, I found ME! \n\nGoa is not just\
  \ sand, wine or beaches, it's the people who embraced their land with pride, welcomed\
  \ the tourists from various parts of the world without any hesitation. The beautiful\
  \ well-maintained beaches, the small basic restaurants, the well-constructed roads,\
  \ the cute little ferries, the tourist-friendly locals, the wonderful shopping and\
  \ not to mention the night life, the parties and the fun.\n\nTraveling gives us\
  \ an opportunity to fill our lives with memories that enlighten us with invaluable\
  \ experiences."
