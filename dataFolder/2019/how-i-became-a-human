Text: "I was 18 years old when I got the chance to go to Berlin for an internship.\
  \ It was the first time traveling alone to a different country. A Brazilian girl\
  \ from a small family, only a mother and sister. I have had lost my father 4 years\
  \ before. My family never had too much money, I studied in public schools my entire\
  \ life, the eductaion was very poor, but somehow I always wanted to study. I started\
  \ studying very hard and preparing myself to get in a good UNI. But still I knew\
  \ something was wrong with me until the day I moved to Berlin. I was there to study.\
  \ I was living in a house with a german woman who used to work to the government.\
  \ She was very kind and beautiful. One day,  she told me that the government was\
  \ making a project to help Syrian refugees, in the moment she said this, I don\u2019\
  t know why, I screamed asking if I could help. She got very surprised and told me\
  \ that she would ask to her boss if I was allowed to help as a volunteer. I was\
  \ so excited and scared. I didn't know what I was going to do. I didn't know exactly\
  \ what was about to happen, I just felt in my heart I had to go. When I got in the\
  \ place, 6 kids were waiting for me in a room. I was completely shocked. Not even\
  \ knew how to talk to them. One of the kids, a small girl with dark hair came in\
  \ my direction and holded my hand, trying to make me play with her. I started trying\
  \ to communicate with them moving my hands to do the things I was trying to say.\
  \ I played with them for hours, tried to teach a few words in Portuguese and German\
  \ (the ones I knew) and tried to learn with them some Arabic. I spent a few days\
  \ doing this. One day, one of the kids started playing that he was hidding a gun.\
  \ I didn't know how to react so I tried to talk to him. He was between 5 or 6. So\
  \ he came to me pretending that he was shooting me, stopped for a bit and took a\
  \ a plastic naify and tried to \u201Ccut\u201D my leg. Like if he was beheading\
  \ me. I holded him, looked into his eyes and gave him a strong hug. The little boy\
  \ started crying while he was holding me very strong. He didn't want to leave my\
  \ embrace. This moment I could hear his heart next to mine. I asked to all the kids\
  \ around if they wanted to have a hug, all them came to me and we stopped for a\
  \ few minutes hugging each other. After this day my life completely changed. I knew\
  \ they were Syrian refugees and I knew some of them have had lost their families.\
  \ But I didn't realize how it was serious, cause I was too concentraced about doing\
  \ something to MYSELF, traveling, meeting people and thinking that the fact I have\
  \ had lost my father, being a poor girl from Brazil was too much already. I didn't\
  \ want to give \u201Cspace\u201D to know that other people were suffering and having\
  \ really difficult times. Even worse than mine. I knew what this little boy did\
  \ to me was a reproduction of the war he was daily living. Can you imagine being\
  \ six, loosing your family, your home, your friends, in a war, having to leave your\
  \ country with no clothes or food, going to a completely different place? I couldn't\
  \ imagine cause I was there to \u201Cstudy\u201D, how privileged I was? The last\
  \ day I came to see them, a woman told me that the german police took all the kids\
  \ and they didn't know anything about them anymore. I didn't have a chance to say\
  \ goodbye. I didn't know what happened to them, if they were alive. Nothing. I couple\
  \ days after I traveled back to Brazil, without answers, but with a heart full of\
  \ compassion and love. They taught me the true love in life."
