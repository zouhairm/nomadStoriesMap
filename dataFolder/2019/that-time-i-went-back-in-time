Text: "I stepped off the twelve-seat prop plane and onto the tarmac in Wamena, West\
  \ Papua, without a plan. Burdened with only my bag, camera, and no small amount\
  \ of disquiet, I had arrived at one of the world\u2019s few remaining primitive\
  \ frontiers. Inspired by a worn-ragged copy of Carl Hoffman\u2019s Savage Harvest,\
  \ his gripping first-hand account retracing the steps of Michael Rockefeller\u2019\
  s ill-fated journey here in the 1960\u2019s, I had booked my flight from Denpasar\
  \ on a whim. With just a few months left on my year-long journey around the world,\
  \ I was determined to test my travel mettle, and to discover for myself a place\
  \ that few knew about \u2013 and certainly no one that I knew did. \n\nAbove the\
  \ jut of Australia\u2019s Cape York in the Arafura Sea sits West Papua on New Guinea,\
  \ the second-largest island on earth. With its long and bloody history of Dutch\
  \ colonization, warring tribes, ritualistic cannibalism, and primitive subsistence,\
  \ West Papua is a land frozen in time; a modern-day visage of the Stone Age.\n\n\
  Discovered from an airplane in 1938, the Dani were once considered the most-dreaded\
  \ warriors on the island. Known for their fierce defense of the fertile lands of\
  \ the Baliem Valley, they are now a peaceful agrarian culture, far removed from\
  \ the more hostile tribes that inhabit West Papua\u2019s southern reaches where\
  \ Rockefeller vanished. \n\nEventually securing meager, but clean accommodations,\
  \ helpful locals I\u2019d encountered introduced me to Khasperd, a Yali tribesman\
  \ who took on odd jobs around town. What followed made West Papua, New Guinea, the\
  \ most interesting place I have ever been.\n\nWe met at dawn, sketched a back-of-the-napkin\
  \ itinerary, steadied our gear and ourselves into the truck bed of an abused Toyota\
  \ Hilux, driving a serpentine dirt road leading out of town until it dissolved at\
  \ a trailhead along a hulking bend of the Baliem River. From here, the next week\
  \ would be on foot.\n\nAfter traversing a seemingly endless span of the valley,\
  \ faint signs of rural life in the distance soon became broad, beaming smiles, awkwardly\
  \ long handshakes and attendant bashful greetings of \u2018wa-wa-wa\u2019, passing\
  \ through several highland villages - stopping to say hello, share the local gossip\
  \ from below, and to rest and refuel each night.  \n\nThe Dani bear a careworn,\
  \ gaunt appearance and sustain on a diet of mostly rice, sweet potatoes, or the\
  \ occasional swine - their only discernible source of protein. With no refrigeration,\
  \ electricity, running water, or basic transportation, they live on the edge. Everything\
  \ beyond what they grow arrives on someone\u2019s narrow shoulders and rationed\
  \ with wartime efficiency. \n\nWith no use for clocks or calendars, they rely on\
  \ seasonal rains to plant and harvest. Passing a village chieftain who did not even\
  \ know how old he was, Khasperd said the man\u2019s uncle remembered the first time\
  \ he saw metal, and that I was the first American he\u2019d ever met. The men wear\
  \ no clothing or covering, save decorative penis gourds, or \u2018kotekas\u2019\
  ; and what would be a week for most modern climbers, they can clamber the brutal\
  \ high passes of the Central Range, the snow-capped mountain spine that cracks New\
  \ Guinea lengthwise, in just a few days.\n\nThe Dani are a proud, warm, and welcoming\
  \ people. They opened up their lives to share of themselves and what little they\
  \ had with me with uncommon grace and generosity, making the Dani of West Papua,\
  \ to me, some of the most hospitable people I\u2019ve ever encountered.  \n\nI suspect\
  \ that for those who travel extensively, deciding upon which destination is the\
  \ most interesting when asked is a difficult and complex question to answer. Count\
  \ me among them. \n\nYet,  travel for me has always been about more than just the\
  \ utter joy of being adrift somewhere new, capturing its essence in photographs.\
  \ It\u2019s also about the people you meet and the bonds you forge along the way,\
  \ often in the unlikeliest of places. They sculpt the feelings and memories of a\
  \ place in rich and vivid detail that lasts a lifetime. \n\nSome say those connections\
  \ are travel\u2019s greatest reward; pursue the memory, not the photo, they say.\
  \ You can\u2019t truly experience a place through a viewfinder. I would agree with\
  \ that. \n\nBut still pack your camera."
