Text: "\"Travel, it\xB4s the best school in life, make your soul grow\". That was\
  \ the moment I realized that being there was the best decision I ever made, I never\
  \ felt more identified with something, it was a message meant for me to hear, I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find such wise words.\nThis was my first trip by myself,\
  \ I still had two months ahead of me of adventures through Europe, but things weren\xB4\
  t going as I planned at all. In a matter of two weeks I had lost a plane, almost\
  \ got robbed and ended up at the hospital with the highest fever of my life. I was\
  \ only Eighteen, I was scared, I was lost, I was really considering changing my\
  \ flight and going back home. \nThis was when a friend that lived in Madrid asked\
  \ to join her in the \"Camino de Santiago\", the Santiago path. I had no idea what\
  \ that was, but I had nothing to lose so thought I\xB4d give my travel a second\
  \ chance, the opportunity to start over. \nFor those of you who don\xB4t know the\
  \ \u201CCamino\u201D are several paths through Europe, all of which end up in Santiago\
  \ de Compostela, the idea is to walk during days, weeks, or even months until you\
  \ get there. Something that started as a catholic tradition is now open to people\
  \ all over the world as an invitation to make an introspection, explore Spain\u2019\
  s beautiful countryside, cleanse your soul from negative thoughts and meet people\
  \ from around the globe.\nAs I was saying, I had no idea what I was getting into,\
  \ and so we started our walk. At first it was the typical trekking, amazing views,\
  \ long talks and even longer trails, we felt pretty good after walking for several\
  \ hours, it wasn\xB4t until the next morning that we realized what we had gotten\
  \ ourselves into. Waking up at 5am for a hike is already a really hard thing, at\
  \ least for me, waking up at 5am after having walked all day before was beyond impossible\
  \ for me and my friend. With a superhuman effort we got out of bed and started a\
  \ new day on the Camino, probably the hardest of them all. As our first day we began\
  \ the path together, but with every step I felt my legs screaming for help, I just\
  \ wasn\u2019t physically prepared for a challenge like this, or so I thought. \n\
  I got to a point where my legs started walking by themselves and had to stop. As\
  \ I sat in the middle of nowhere all my fears and worries came back, making me ask\
  \ myself for the last time if I was made for traveling alone and whether should\
  \ I keep going or just pack my bags and head back home. I have no idea how much\
  \ time went by, or even if I was conscious during the whole thing, when suddenly\
  \ I felt someone sitting right next to me. At first I thought it was Ale, my friend,\
  \ but when I looked to my side I saw an old man admiring Spain\xB4s marvelous country\
  \ side. He handed me a bottle of water and a peach and said: \u201Cwe all need a\
  \ break sometimes, just take your time.\u201D And so we had one of those conversations\
  \ that you remember for the rest of your life, and when I was ready we began our\
  \ path again, together. It was a connection I never felt with anyone before, he\
  \ made me feel so safe and convinced that I was at the place I was supposed to be,\
  \ I had made the right decision by adventuring into this trip, he gave me the strength\
  \ I needed to carry on. \nI enjoyed Joaquin\xB4s company for the rest of the \u201C\
  camino\u201D, getting to learn from his amazing knowledge until the very last minute\
  \ together. \"Travel, it\xB4s the best school in life, make your soul grow\". I\
  \ felt my soul slowly beginning to grow that week, helping me conquer my lifelong\
  \ dream of traveling, making me open my eyes to the mysterious world I still have\
  \ to explore, falling in love of \u201CThe Best School in Life\u201D."
