Text: 'Two Double-O One Six, the year of the fable

  Kid lives in England, laptop on the table

  He''s working and hurting, tabling knights are so long,

  His dreams smell like Africa, just wants to be gone


  He jumps on that WiFi, downloads a new life,

  Then he uploads a profile to impress his new wife,

  No skills and no lies, escape, and let''s thrive

  My old life is dying, I killed it, no knives


  Namibia wants him; Nambians want him right now

  Get here by the weekend, we''ll see you, brown cow

  Three planes and 4 taxis, a bus and a bow

  Kongola you beauty, I''m all yours, pink sow


  Kid digs like a badger, he sweats and he burns

  Sleeps under the stars, ignoring world turns

  Hurts melts into droplets, pain fades to mirage

  Each strike of the shovel, steps away from Farage


  No Brexit, no Trump, nothing more, just the sun

  The Nambians love him, he loves them like sons

  They bend it like Beckham, like termites they build

  This new life emerges, his old world is healed


  The son keeps on shining, he knows that he''s write

  Each word is like therapy, revealing his light

  The flame keeps on burning

  All the way through the night


  The Lions are roaring like hyenas at rest,

  His second best words are enough for the best,

  Whilst tracking the leopard, he knows there''s no test

  In the land of Madiba, each mound is a breast


  These people are ready, they know that they are

  Their hearts are so pained, got no time to yell Klaar

  The voortrek is over, the fighting is done

  We emerge from the shadows with the spirit of Jah


  Yahweh, we recede, just to impede your stampede

  Our denial denies your impulse to proceed

  Your seed is like zygotes, so goatly honey mede

  Heaven sent pied crow pecking carrion to suck seed


  These verses are sprawling like the ants that are crawling

  Doctor Zeus of this rhyme game, so tame pain, so falling

  Gonna chill now, no rushing, no stalling

  You Russians are so icy, Americans ballin


  Let''s wrap this rap up like palindromes reversing

  These verses just a rehearsal for hurting

  MCs stuck in the lunch line till crunch time they squirting

  A pig in a dress, just a flirty inverting'
