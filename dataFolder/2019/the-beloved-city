Text: "The Beloved City\n\nCities build their identity from the way we relate to them.\
  \ As observers or as intervenors, we weave a mesh of attributes and connections\
  \ that define what they are. Just like people do.\nIn an expanded view of the theme,\
  \ it is possible to recognize in cities a level of consciousness to which we feel\
  \ integrated in different intensities. Therefore, it is understandable to identify\
  \ with some of them in the same way that we identify with certain people.\nThere\
  \ are those who attract at once: send subliminal messages that escape from reason\
  \ and understanding. When the instant sensation is of connection, explanations are\
  \ dispensable. There's a chemistry \u2013 that's enough. For some adventurers this\
  \ can be tough to accept. They close off, impose a certain distance. Others surrender\
  \ to the charms of the city and are not afraid to admit: they are in love.\nIn the\
  \ first encounters, everything is enchanting. When we give in to seduction, details\
  \ that many others see, but do not perceive, seem to us absolutely fascinating \u2013\
  \ worthy to be captured from various angles of our eyes and lenses and transformed\
  \ into objects of contemplation.\nThe look on the muse city is always photographic:\
  \ the sharp senses seek new representations of beauty, a trace of genius or anything\
  \ unexpected. And like every good lover, it knows that novelty keeps us attentive\
  \ and delivered \u2013 and therefore always has surprises to offer.\nLike in any\
  \ passion, it is difficult to perceive flaws and the first ones that appear seem\
  \ acceptable and almost charming. After all, perfection intimidates, puts the object\
  \ of admiration in an untouchable position. Now, knowing the weaknesses of the city,\
  \ we can show that we accept them and thus we become even more intimate.\nThe fascination\
  \ for the novel never disappears, but the anxiety that it generates begins to demand\
  \ comfort, and it is gained in interaction. The eagerness to know more and to be\
  \ surprises matures into a familiarity that brings a certain peace. It causes a\
  \ sense of belonging \u2013 as in the arms of the loved one. The city now understands\
  \ and integrates us. We have the feeling of being at home after living among strangers.\
  \ Then we find ourselves in a relationship of love.\nAs in every love, we reinforce\
  \ similarities by combining individual traits into a set of preferences that come\
  \ to be of both: our hidden path, our food, our fado music, our park bench, our\
  \ Saturday afternoon walks along the river, our coffee shop near the lighthouse,\
  \ our favorite spot on the bridge. We create small comforting rituals while we are\
  \ together.\nWe can share these moments and places, socialize from time to time.\
  \ The beloved city is welcoming by nature, does not like exclusivity. But it is\
  \ in moments of silence and solitude that we reach more intimacy. It is in observation\
  \ and contemplation that we learn to know ourselves.\nThe city \u2013 my beloved\
  \ Porto \u2013 appeals to the most engaging forms of communication to offer its\
  \ charms and the chance to love this world and its endless expressions; And I, always\
  \ among the lovers, promise to pay attention."
