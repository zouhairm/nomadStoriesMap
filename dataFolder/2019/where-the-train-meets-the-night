Text: "The man strode quietly toward me through the well-lit, wide train carriage.\
  \ We had just arrived at Nakseongdae station where my friends were getting off.\
  \ They stood from the empty platform and waved excessively through the train window,\
  \ blowing kisses and calling my name, clearly enjoying teasing me so publicly. I\
  \ motioned to them to leave, laughing at their silly expressions. We had just returned\
  \ from an all-day music festival and I suppose the excitement of it all hadn\u2019\
  t worn down. \nThe man grinned as he took his seat beside me, the corners of his\
  \ narrow eyes creasing as he tried, and failed, to suppress a chuckle on the silent\
  \ train. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly what was so funny until I saw his phone in his\
  \ hand. Maybe he\u2019s watching a video or talking to a friend, I thought. He chuckled\
  \ again, turning toward me, he started,\n\u2018Your friends are funny\u2019\nAh,\
  \ so he was laughing at us.\n\u2018They\u2019re idiots\u2019, I said smiling, half-surprised\
  \ but just as amused that he was acknowledging complete strangers. His face was\
  \ youthful, and he seemed kind as he beamed back at me.\n\u2018Are you living here\
  \ in South Korea?\u2019 His face was filled with curiosity and I could take a guess\
  \ why. From the short month that I had stayed here, I hadn\u2019t tallied many people\
  \ that looked like me: tanned skin, a short but full figure and wearing a hijab.\
  \ Many interactions I had had with locals always involved a plethora of personal\
  \ questions: where was I from, what was I wearing on my head, what was my purpose\
  \ in this country and what drew me to it in the first place. My answers were always\
  \ the same brief response.\n\u2018I\u2019m studying at SNU\u2019s summer school.\u2019\
  \n\u2018Seoul National University?\u2019 his eyes widened a little, seemingly impressed.\
  \ Apparently, SNU was the \u2018Harvard\u2019 of South Korea. It was the pride of\
  \ any Korean parent to send their child there, or so I heard. Of course, it\u2019\
  s much easier to get into the summer program and I explained this. I guess it came\
  \ across as modest instead of truthful because he laughed again. \nMany of the people\
  \ I had met in South Korea were always delighted to hear me and my friends attempt\
  \ speaking in Korean. They were also eager to practice their English and I\u2019\
  d be equally as delighted by their level of fluency. As the train continued towards\
  \ our destination and as Jun Hyun continued to converse with me, I became increasingly\
  \ impressed with how well he spoke. On our short journey we seemed to cover every\
  \ topic which surprisingly included the weather, politics and religion. \nIt was\
  \ the rainy season here. It had rained consecutively for the past week, but coming\
  \ from London, rain was the only thing that felt familiar in this new corner of\
  \ the world. Jun Hyun told me that when he wasn\u2019t working as a business intern,\
  \ he would play basketball with his local team. Since it was raining a lot, he hadn\u2019\
  t been for a while and played Foosball with his friends instead, which was where\
  \ he was going now. I asked what his work was like, did he enjoy it? It seemed the\
  \ working environment was stressful, and the hours were long. This was common for\
  \ many corporate jobs in South Korea, Jun Hyun explained, but a perk of his job\
  \ was that he got to travel to many different countries like Australia and America.\
  \ \n\u2018It\u2019s how I improved my English\u2019 \nI explained that I was staying\
  \ in the Mapo-Gu district (leaving out any specifics) which was known to be a popular\
  \ area for South Korean youth. The drinking and clubbing culture there was huge,\
  \ so Jun Hyun couldn\u2019t understand how I\u2019d never drank alcohol before.\
  \ \n\u2018Would you ever consider it? Your parents wouldn\u2019t know!\u2019 Jun\
  \ Hyun joked.\n\u2018Ah, but God would\u2019, I replied, laughing. \nWe must have\
  \ passed about 20 stops. I\u2019d dreaded the journey home alone but was grateful\
  \ for Jun Hyun\u2019s company. When we finally reached Hongik University Station,\
  \ he stood up.\n\u2018You\u2019re getting off here too?\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019,\
  \ I replied.\n\u2018Would you like to join me at the arcade?\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019\
  d love to.\u2019"
