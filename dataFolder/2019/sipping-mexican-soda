Text: "\u201CI think I lived here in a past life\u201D Sidney said looking out on\
  \ to the canal. She was sitting on an orange wicker chair with her feet up, left\
  \ arm leaning out the side of the boat, hair pulled back in a beautiful braid, with\
  \ sun beating down on half her face. I looked at her soaking in the moment, sipping\
  \ on the soda that she claims is much better in Mexico than in Canada. \n\nAnd for\
  \ a moment I forgot. It's easy sometimes to forget that she is sick. \n\nShe doesn\u2019\
  t look sick now that she has stopped the treatment. She doesn't act sick as she\
  \ plunges off cliffs into the ocean, or hikes up hills with more speed and grace\
  \ than I can. She definitely doesn\u2019t ever talk about being sick. \n\nSidney\
  \ was told she might only have a year to live.\n \nThe first thing I said was, \u201C\
  So where do you want to go?\u201D, and to my surprise she chose Mexico City. \n\n\
  I never would've gone to Mexico if anyone else had asked. I knew I was probably\
  \ being narrow-minded for fearing the country based on its controversial reputation.\
  \ Yet as each person`s eyes widened when I said we would be staying at a local`s\
  \ home in Mexico city, I became more and more fearful of the trip ahead. \n\nBut\
  \ here, drifting down the canals of Xochimilco, I've never been more at peace. The\
  \ truth is Mexico is vastly misrepresented. On these canals, in one of the large,\
  \ brightly coloured, wooden boats called trajineras, its true spirit shows though.\
  \ \n\nTo our left, laughter roars from a family gathered around the center table\
  \ of their trajineras. The grandmother is standing at the head of the table, filling\
  \ plates with piles of food. I can`t understand the Spanish exchanges they are having,\
  \ but the back and forth banter between family is recognizable in any language.\
  \ \n\nTo our right, a man in a row boat has a pot of boiling water and a small grill\
  \ tied to it. I watch in awe as he takes a cob of corn from the water, chars it\
  \ on the grill, and then rolls it in spices. \u201CElote?\u201D the man asks, holding\
  \ the cob in the air. I bite into the perfectly cooked corn, tasting the sweetness\
  \ at first followed by the lingering heat of cayenne and paprika in the back of\
  \ my throat. I can\u2019t believe something so delicious was made on a row boat\
  \ in the middle of the canal. \n\nA trajineras filled with a full mariachi band\
  \ wearing matching white suits and sombreros floats by us, their music filling the\
  \ whole canal. The family next to us begins to clap and sing along. I pretend to\
  \ know the words as I bob to the upbeat tempo. \n\nAll these things are what I wish\
  \ the world thought of when they think of Mexico. I wish they could see the bright\
  \ colours that adorn each trajineras. I wish they could taste the bold flavours\
  \ of Mexican specialties like chiccarron - crispy fried pork belly, and conchas\
  \ - flavoured sweet Mexican bread buns. I wish they could hear the laughter of a\
  \ family as they gather around a table sharing stories. I wish they could feel the\
  \ energy of the bustling canal, as everyone sways to the lively music. I wish they\
  \ could know the pride of the people here, who would never ask for handouts but\
  \ work hard all day selling snacks or trinkets instead. This is the Mexico that\
  \ I never expected, but this is the Mexico that I fell in love with. \n\nSidney\
  \ half smiles and says \u201CI'm glad we came here, we might not have another opportunity.\
  \ They say these canals are drying up and might not be here for long\u201D. I hold\
  \ back tears because I know she means that she might not be here for long. I am\
  \ also glad we came, because I'll always remember her like this \u2013 with her\
  \ feet up, hair pulled back in a beautiful braid, sun beating down on half her face,\
  \ looking perfectly at ease as she sips her Mexican soda."
