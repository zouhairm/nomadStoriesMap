Text: "It was the second last paper of our 10th board exams. Loosened ties, messy\
  \ hair, scorching heat and tensed discussions, a very usual scene prior to any paper.\
  \ But not for me. I secretly smiled in my head, fully aware that the board examinations\
  \ were nearing it's end, and my much awaited trip to the United States was just\
  \ around the corner. \n\nCame the last day of the examination. I hadn't seen more\
  \ excitement and happiness around in the entire month. Everybody had a reason to\
  \ rejoice, but I had TWO.\n\nBack then, my parents thought that I was old and wise\
  \ enough to travel all by myself. Little did they know that they were about to give\
  \ me the best experience of my life. It was my first solo international trip. I\
  \ was packing, mindlessly though. Half my heart in the glamorous streets of Manhattan\
  \ and political lanes of Washington DC. Even 24 hours seemed a light year away.\
  \ \n\nThe big day finally arrived. As repeatedly instructed by my father, I kept\
  \ all the important documents in my side sling, for easy access. Like every Indian\
  \ mother, mine too had packed a box full of ladoos and Indian snacks for my cousins.\
  \ With another two bags full of love, I departed for the most awaited dream vacation\
  \ of mine. \n\nI had a direct flight from Mumbai to New York and then a connecting\
  \ flight to Washington. I had travelled international before, so I was pretty confident\
  \ about managing myself and my luggage. After 16 hours of covering 7796 miles, we\
  \ finally landed at John F Kennedy International Airport. I did pretty well for\
  \ the first leg of the journey, or at least I thought I did.\n\nThe airport was\
  \ humongous, like no other airport ever seen before. Must say, it was pretty intimidating.\
  \ Not very difficult for an individual to get lost in its awe. \n\nLike every other\
  \ passenger, I moved towards the luggage belt. Everybody seemed in a hurry, but\
  \ I stood there appreciating the little details, until I realised that the last\
  \ lot of luggage was taken and I was standing in front of an empty luggage belt.\
  \ I suddenly panicked. I didn\u2019t know what to do, since I hadn\u2019t handled\
  \ a situation like this before. After speaking to a couple of people, most of whose\
  \ accent I didn\u2019t understand, I decided to go approach the lady at the counter.\
  \ After trying to explain my situation, she immediately checked and told me that\
  \ my luggage was checked in for the entire journey and I had to directly collect\
  \ it at Washington. After all the negative thoughts about my lost luggage, this\
  \ was a relief. I was happy that I handled it well, not knowing that I had another\
  \ situation coming my way.\n\nI left for the train to get to another terminal for\
  \ my flight to Washington. The American accent being different from the Indian one,\
  \ communication seemed a problem. After multiple stops, and spending an hour in\
  \ the train, I still hadn\u2019t reached my terminal. In the fear of missing my\
  \ flight, I got down at one of the terminals and started crying. Understanding directions\
  \ in that accent still posed a problem. A couple who saw me crying, came and approached\
  \ me. After making me comfortable, they gave me exact directions like nobody else\
  \ had. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to them. After following their directions,\
  \ I settled in and waited to reach my terminal. Amidst all this, I hadn\u2019t realised\
  \ that I had left my ticket with the lady at the counter. Another wave of panic\
  \ struck me. That\u2019s when I remembered of the multiple ticket prints that I\
  \ had carried. I fetched that and felt a sense of calm. \n\nI reached the terminal\
  \ and boarded my flight just in time. I learnt how not to panic in any situation\
  \ since there\u2019s a solution to everything. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful\
  \ to my parents for believing in me. \n\nThe journey taught me a lot and helped\
  \ me grow as a person. The rest of the trip was even more beautiful, all memories\
  \ captured in pictures!\n\nIndeed, I got lost, only to find myself!"
