Text: I live in Indonesia a country where 5 religion is acknowledge by the government.
  During my time i witness the change of perception of my country about religion view
  especially with the political year is coming. A lot of friends become enemy just
  because of different point of view. It's really hard to find out that the famous
  Indonesia culture that being friendly, lot of smiles, is turning into more radical.
  But it really surprised me that in some area the religion view and political view
  doesn't affect the people. They still do their tradition regardless of what happened
  out there. Neighbors still help each other like the way used to be. There's no white
  and black, Christian and Moslem in the village we are all the same the child of
  God. And even we are not relatives by blood but we are relatives by humanity. I
  hope that the rest of the world could be better but i know it's hard to change the
  world. What we can do is to change ourself give example like the village in my story
  in lombok west nusa tenggara. The people still live in harmony to each other no
  matter what happened. We could take that as an example and show it to rest of the
  world that we are actually brothers and sisters in humanity no matter what we are
  or from where we are.
