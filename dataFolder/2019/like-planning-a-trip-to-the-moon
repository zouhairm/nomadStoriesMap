Text: "It is 2 a.m. in San Francisco when I board the bus in Reykjavik, or 9 a.m.\
  \ local time. It is my third day in Iceland, and I am going to spend the month of\
  \ March at an artist residency located in a small fishing village in the Westfjords\
  \ called Skagastr\xF6nd.  I note that the town's entire population could fit inside\
  \ a lecture hall at my old art school. \n\nIt is the first of three residencies\
  \ I will be attending over the next five months. I have put all my belongings in\
  \ storage and have rented out my car.  I have no apartment to go back to, no pets,\
  \ no partner in waiting, only an art studio that I am subletting to a friend and\
  \ a job I can do anywhere. \n\nThese thoughts swirl around my head as I look out\
  \ the bus window where hills covered in patches of snow and dry grass go speeding\
  \ by.  I doze off only to awake an hour later to see the landscape transformed into\
  \ pure white. The ground rises into majestic peaks on either side of the Ring Road\
  \ as we climb north. \n\nBefore I leave for Iceland, I feel like I am planning a\
  \ trip to the moon. Between the promise of rural isolation, the beautiful but difficult-to-learn\
  \ language, and the many unknowns about the culture- it all feels very alien. This\
  \ is precisely what I want, and yet.  \n\nI wonder why I am choosing to slingshot\
  \ myself across the globe to an island whose name literally means land of frozen\
  \ water when 15 years earlier I fled the sub-zero winters of my hometown in Minnesota\
  \ for the friendlier climate of San Francisco. \n\nI ask myself this question as\
  \ I purchase waterproof hiking boots and long underwear, while I stuff an ankle-length\
  \ down jacket into my suitcase, and especially when I read about the strap-on metal\
  \ spikes that are recommended for navigating the snowy terrain by foot.  While the\
  \ technical answer is to make art and write, the personal answer is less clear.\
  \ \n\nAround 1:30 p.m. we arrive in Skagastr\xF6nd.  The driver drops three of us\
  \ off in front of a metal-sided warehouse located on the edge of H\xFAnafl\xF3i\
  \ Bay. There are mountains to the south and north, farmland to the east, and to\
  \ the west an austere coastline lined with snow-covered fjords fading into blue\
  \ on the horizon. \n\nOver the next few days I am surprised to find that, among\
  \ the many challenges of getting settled in this small town situated a mere 60 kilometers\
  \ south of the arctic circle, the cold is not the worst of them.   After centuries\
  \ of roughing the sharp winds off the Atlantic, the Icelandic people have figured\
  \ out how to heat their homes until they are warm and dry like a piece of toast.\
  \  (You can't say the same for Bay Area landlords).  \n\nWhat is hard is adjusting\
  \ to the slower pace of life, and feeling settled in the community.  While I enjoy\
  \ meeting the other artists, it is getting to know the locals that makes me feel\
  \ most connected to the town.  After a week of daily trips to the heated swimming\
  \ pool, known in Iceland as a hot pot, I begin to chat with some of the regulars\
  \ and learn about their lives.  \n\nOn my first weekend there, I find myself at\
  \ the only bar in town during the only two hours that it's open, Saturday from 11\
  \ p.m. - 1 a.m.  A farmer, a chef, a fisherman, and three artists spend a night\
  \ drinking, gossiping and playing cards.  It's like the set-up for an old, corny\
  \ joke, except for it's real, and fun, and somehow life-affirming.  \n\nI leave\
  \ around 2 a.m. with a slight buzz from my two white wines and in my purse a vacuum-sealed\
  \ steak of frozen K\xE6stur h\xE1karl, or fermented shark, from the chef. \n\nAs\
  \ I write this, I am still on my journey far from home.  I am no closer to knowing\
  \ what I will do when it's all over, but after a successful landing in Iceland,\
  \ I feel ready to travel further into the void."
