Text: "Hong Kong is one of the most densely populated city in Asia. More than 7 thousand\
  \ people live in 426 sq mi. As a special administration region of China, Hong Kong\
  \ grow up rapidly and be an international city with so many people of the world\
  \ visit Hong Kong, including Indonesians, one of countries in Southeast Asia. For\
  \ Indonesian, we don't have to apply visa for visit Hong Kong. \n\nNow, let's start\
  \ the journey. I start from Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. Departed from\
  \ Soekarno-Hatta International Airport Terminal 2. We have 2 choices, direct flight\
  \ to Hongkong from Jakarta or transit flight via Kuala Lumpur Malaysia or Changi\
  \ Airport Singapore that have cheaper cost. For this time, we board the flight to\
  \ Kuala Lumpur, transit for a day and the next day, we go to Hong Kong.\n\nFlight\
  \ from Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur only took 2 hours. Everything was good. I landed\
  \ at KLIA safely. Spending about 15 hours in KL before next flight, we can do many\
  \ things here. Trying malaysian food or indian food is a good idea. A spices of\
  \ food delights the palate of people the world over. 'Nasi briyani' is one of the\
  \ most favorite malaysian food. Rice cooked with spices was added with vegetables\
  \ or meat or chicken. \n\nIn the next day, early morning, I go to the KLIA Airport\
  \ and ready to go to Hong Kong. The departure time schedule of my flight was 7.35\
  \ a.m. Take the airport train (KLIA express) to the airport that only takes 33 minutes.\
  \ I just arrive at the airport on 5.33 a.m. I go to the check in area. I got surprise.\
  \ The airlines staff inform me that my flight was cancelled, Oh My God! \"I'm so\
  \ sorry, sir. There was a tropical storm that caused all flights from and into Hong\
  \ Kong this morning were cancelled\" the airlines staff said. \n\nThey offer 2 solutions.\
  \ One, they switched my flight to the afternoon flight. But even that can't be certain\
  \ to fly. Wonder how the weather will be in Hong Kong that afternoon. Two, they\
  \ refund 100% of my ticket. It's a hard choices. But, cause I already here and the\
  \ hotel in Hong Kong have booked, so I choose to switch my flight to the afternoon\
  \ flight. Hope the weather's better. \n\n\"OK sir, we'll process your new flight\"\
  . Waiting for a moment and.. tadaa, I got my new boarding pass. \"This is your new\
  \ boarding pass, sir. Your flight would be depart at 16.40 in the afternoon from\
  \ gate Q13. Any questions ?\" the airlines staff said. \"No, thank you\" I said.\
  \ The time is now 6.50 a.m. I have about 10 hours more until my flight departs.\
  \ Because I left the hotel early moning, I haven't had breakfast. So, now it's time\
  \ to searching for some foods.\n\nThe nearest and quiet place was kfc. I go there\
  \ and order some breakfast menu with a cup of ice coffee. About an hour in kfc.\
  \ What's next ? I don't have any idea to kill the long time I waited. Just go around\
  \ this super big airport. \"Aha, I know!\" I go to the viewing deck and do spotted\
  \ the aircraft. Only an hour here and I got bored. I walk away from that place and\
  \ searching for a quiet place. I got it! A place near the departure gate, in the\
  \ upstairs. It's time to close my eyes for awhile.\n\nAbout 2 hours fall asleep.\
  \ I have 4 hours more until my flight departs. I decide to have lunch. Find a malaysian\
  \ restaurant in KLIA shopping mall. I choose laksa for lunch today. After that,\
  \ go to the mosque to pray Dhuhr. Then, coffee time! Probably about an hour in that\
  \ coffee shop. About 2 hours before flight, I go to the departure gate, clear the\
  \ immigration and custom, and go to the boarding gate. Waiting about 30 minutes\
  \ and Yaa! Boarding time! Oh God, I didn't think I'd make it through this long waiting.\n\
  \nI'm coming Hong Kong !"
