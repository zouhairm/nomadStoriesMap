Text: "The shop assistant approached me for the third time. \"Necesitas algo?\" (Do\
  \ you need something?) I'd been standing in the aisle for an eternity, not causing\
  \ trouble, but not buying anything either. He took a step forward and tried again,\
  \ a little louder. \"Necesitas algo?\"\_\n\n(Crap. What's 'no' in Spanish? Wait,\
  \ it's the same as English. Is it?)\n\nIt was either a panic attack or a stroke.\
  \ I couldn't tell. I turned to the shop assistant and attempted to say something,\
  \ ANYTHING. This was the first person who had spoken to me all day, all week, but\
  \ again I found myself mute, just when it mattered. I squeaked, dropped the jar\
  \ of olives I'd been fondling, sending glass in all directions, and sprinted out\
  \ of the shop faster than I've ever sprinted anywhere. Team GB would have been proud.\
  \ Of the running, not the olives.\n\nI always thought of myself as well-traveled.\
  \ By this , I don't mean that I spent a parent-funded gap year exploring South-East\
  \ Asia with a million others, returning with questionable dreadlocks and a penchant\
  \ for hallucinogenics. I've journeyed across Europe with hardly any Euros in my\
  \ pocket. Without any pockets, actually. I've wandered across the Great Wall. I've\
  \ almost been arrested in Marrakesh. I've (accidentally) partied with gang members\
  \ in Beijing.\_I was chased by a demigod in New Mexico. God I sound pretentious.\
  \ But nothing could have prepared me for exchanging vacations for a permanent move\
  \ overseas.\n\n(It's Spain, for eff's sake, get yourself together) I thought, creeping\
  \ miserably across the street to my apartment. (It's hardly Mongolia, is it?)\n\n\
  I was two hours from Madrid, in a beautiful, ancient city known for it's unique\
  \ architecture, sizable student population and ham shops. I'd quit the London rat\
  \ race and relocated, after years of procrastinating, to learn the language and\
  \ do something with my life that went beyond a desk. I wanted this. So what was\
  \ wrong?\n\nTo say this was a leap into the unknown was an understatement. I spoke\
  \ two words of Spanish, on a good day. I had no local friends. I was fighting with\
  \ the impossible bureaucracy system. I was depressed. I'd left behind a well-paid\
  \ job, a decent apartment, family, friends. What's more, the UK had just voted to\
  \ leave the EU, so I lived in constant uncertainty as to whether or not I would\
  \ be deported.\n\nI was 27 and I had no idea what I was doing.\n\nThat evening,\
  \ I barricaded myself in my room, refusing to talk to anyone. The evening turned\
  \ into a weekend, turned into a week.\n\nGradually, things began to improve in the\
  \ weeks following the olive debacle. I learned a little Spanish. I adjusted to my\
  \ work. I even made a friend, a local boy with better English than mine, who promised\
  \ to show me the city in its glory. Before he dragged me out one night to some local\
  \ bars, I reluctantly slapped on makeup, changed the pajamas I'd been wearing for\
  \ two days, and pondered the price of a gin. (You can do this) I told myself. (Even\
  \ if it goes wrong. Just try).\n\nWe ended up in a small underground club with a\
  \ group of Italians. I couldn't understand any of them, but they were nice, and\
  \ the club was something else. It was packed, and it was the first time I'd heard\
  \ 90s hip hop in months. Everyone was happy. Suddenly, the uncertainty and false\
  \ starts of the previous weeks didn't matter. The outside world still existed, and,\
  \ despite the unfamiliarity, was it really so different to what I'd left behind?\
  \ (I can do this), I thought, as the crowd belted out the words to California Love,\
  \ nword unfortunately included.\n\nFast forward one year and I'm now a DJ in that\
  \ club. After that night, fueled by gin and 2Pac, I decided to get my life together.\
  \ I navigated the bureaucracy, got a raise, learned Spanish and even made friends.\
  \ I found a therapist. That helped too.\n\nIt was the hardest thing I've ever done,\
  \ but I made it.\n\nAnd the next time I went into that shop for a jar of olives,\
  \ I didn't break a single thing."
