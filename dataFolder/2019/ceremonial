Text: "Curls of white smoke drifting over me, licking my skin, evaporating into a\
  \ faint cloud above me. Picking up any negative energy I held, consciously or subconsciously,\
  \ taking it from my mind and body, releasing it, so it was no longer mine. The warm,\
  \ woody smell of Nag champa floating through the room, setting a meditative vibe,\
  \ the ever so slight aroma of magnolia, this smell has always been a favourite of\
  \ mine. Glowing light poured in through the large bay window, a prism of colours\
  \ dancing magically through the stained glass. A repetitive bold drum beat sent\
  \ an energetic yet calming vibration through the room.\n\nA knotted feeling in the\
  \ pit of my stomach, anxiety, and nerves eagerly muddled with excitement. I watch\
  \ the healer; she sat at the altar, feathers hanging in her hair, tickling her cheeks,\
  \ as she held a piece of bark in her hand, a small, sharp, hand carved knife in\
  \ the other, on the bark were translucent globs of what looked like hard jelly.\n\
  \nAll the makings of a ceremonial ritual and that it is. I am here for Kambo. I\
  \ always thought my first plant medicine experience would be 'authentic', in the\
  \ jungle, with a shaman who didn't speak English, sitting in a hut, probably monkeys\
  \ watching on. It seems though, authentic can be unexpected. Sometimes these extraordinary\
  \ experiences come to us in strange formats. \n\nNot religious in the slightest\
  \ but a fan of cheap rent, I found my sanctuary in the form of a bedsit in an old\
  \ Evangelical Church, my room overlooked their courtyard and at this very given\
  \ moment, while I took part in my ceremony, they- the church members- took part\
  \ in their own. It was time for choir practice. Breathing in my shamanic experience\
  \ I felt gratitude for the added energy of 50 angelic voices singing to their God...\
  \ the harmonies weaving through the walls, mixing uniquely with the drums of my\
  \ Shaman.\n\nI'm in central London; Hoxton to be exact. Who would find this experience\
  \ here? Me. I would. And here I sat, brave and ready to dive into the unknown. My\
  \ arm is wiped clean and a small stick is set alight, the flame blown out then pressed\
  \ into my flesh, a slight sting, a nice sting. Breathing through pain brings a strange\
  \ sense of pleasure. I am to receive five dots in total; the knife picks up the\
  \ dollops of Kambo, my healer positions each ball on the separate burns; the raw\
  \ flesh allows it to stick nicely.\n\nMy healer, sat back, the sage still burning,\
  \ it began feeling claustrophobic. The smoke felt thicker like it was chasing my\
  \ breath. Maybe the sage saw the negative energy inside me and needed to reach in\
  \ and yank it out my body. \"Breath,\" she told me as she picked up her drum, a\
  \ slow steady beat drowned out the faint preaching of the choir. A little giggle\
  \ in the back of my mind at the strangeness of the moment. You would never think\
  \ on the other side of the courtyard gate below my window was a strict Church and\
  \ beyond that, busy central London, the tube just a block away, people rushing about\
  \ in the typical dreary London weather.\n\nHeat took over my body; it was so hot.\
  \ My heartbeat was loud; it vibrated through my entire body, pumping, I could almost\
  \ hear the blood pumping through my veins. Why was I doing this? Suddenly I felt\
  \ the energy move from my core, up, up into my throat and pour out my mouth into\
  \ the bucket I was cradling between my legs. My body was heavy, hot and heavy, and\
  \ an invisible weight I felt on my shoulders, it was weighing me down, I couldn't\
  \ hold my self up, slumping to the ground, 'Cerise, I know its hard but you need\
  \ to keep your body upright, the Kambo, she needs to flow', and flow she did, from\
  \ the depths of my soul, the unwanted energy escaping.\n\n\nI'm left exhausted.\
  \ Empty but full. Sad. Tears flow. And what came next changed my life. Repressed\
  \ memories from my childhood."
