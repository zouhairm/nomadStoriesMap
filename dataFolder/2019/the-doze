  \ in his personal and professional life.\nHis brain turns out to be seriously injured\
  \ but he fells totally fine so the doctor give him an advice: Do not go home immediately,\
  \ during a flight anytime soon your brain veins may explode and you will be permanently\
  \ affected or even die.\nLife puts him in this unexpected circumstances that may\
  \ be his last days and he decides to not be patient. Signs out of the hospital and\

  \ \"Zola, I'll be here for you untill I pass away in this very bed and devote my\
  \ life to children here\".\nThey pray in zulu very softly, Zola says and Diego repeats.\
  \ \nDiego is finally happy for once."
