Text: "While narrating my travel adventures, I credit my Sister and her employment\
  \ with Emirates Airlines for turning my travel dreams into reality. Although we\
  \ have signed up for membership at the Association of Bizarre Airport Events ever\
  \ since, it is a fact that my family and I are privileged to fly with discounted\
  \ air tickets. \n\nAs an active member of this fictional union, I believe my departure\
  \ back home to Dubai with Mom from Hyderabad\u2019s Rajiv Gandhi International Airport\
  \ tops my list of crazy episodes in an airport. \n\nThe next morning was the First\
  \ of September, 2014 - My freshman day at University. After five long months of\
  \ being absolutely unproductive, it was one of the two days I looked forward to\
  \ in that year. The other day being my Eighteenth Birthday, falling five days later.\
  \  \n\n5:40PM: We arrived at check-in for our 8:45PM departing flight, and were\
  \ greeted by a fully booked flight and standby boarding passes. \n\n7:00PM: Fourteen\
  \ economy boarding passes were yet to be printed. If at least two passengers did\
  \ not show up on time, Mom and I would fly. I have found myself in a dilemma ever\
  \ since I began traveling on staff tickets. In a full flight, a no-show passenger\
  \ implied that I could fly. But were my prayers translating to a tragedy for a passenger\
  \ to miss their flight? Was it unethical to claim a full-fare passengers seat? Was\
  \ my intend to attend first day of college a strong enough reason to be given priority?\n\
  \n7:40PM: Within forty minutes of self scrutiny, two caramel macchiatos and three\
  \ washroom trips, twelve new faces showed up with their passports. To free myself\
  \ from the guilt of hoping the remaining passengers would lose their way, I compared\
  \ it to the classic situation when fellow passengers appealed for switching aircraft\
  \ seats with them. As not giving up my aisle or window seat is not deemed unethical,\
  \ I convinced myself that wishing to fly to choose my courses the next day was not\
  \ unethical either. \n\nWith the sight of a new check-in passenger, my inner debate\
  \ came to a full-stop. The painful truth then appeared clearly. Even if we caught\
  \ the next flight after sunrise, I would still be over the Arabian Sea while freshers\
  \ were welcomed into University. \n\nAt the departures exit, an armed guard was\
  \ convinced I was bluffing. \u201CA passengers entry into an aircraft is their only\
  \ way to exit the airport\u201D, he said. Unable to comprehend my staff-being-denied-seats-when-a-flight-is-full\
  \ theory, he demanded to hear the real story from real Emirates staff. \n\nAfter\
  \ my short sprint back to the check-in counter, a staff member asks with a puzzled\
  \ look, \u201CAre you Sripriya Reddy? Where is the other passenger who is traveling\
  \ with you?\u201D \n\nIs there a procedure to exit this airport? Do we have to fill\
  \ some sort of forms now?, I wanted to ask. \n\n\u201CYes, that\u2019s me. We were\
  \ trying to exit. What happened?\u201D. I asked instead. \n\n\u201CHow many bags\
  \ for check-in? Can I see your passports?\u201D, she said, ignoring my question.\
  \ \n\nIt was 8:20PM. I was sure she was kidding. \u201CBut I was told that there\
  \ were no seats and the flight is full\u201D, I stated, still confused. \n\n\u201C\
  Yes! Economy class was filled. We upgraded two Platinum members to Business class.\
  \ There are two vacant seats now\u201D, she replied. \n\nWith my latest discovery,\
  \ I charged towards the exit with and screamed with excitement, \u201CMommm! We\
  \ are going home! On the same flight! Hurryyyyy!\u201D\n\nThanks to the delay we\
  \ caused, our flight departed at 9:15PM. \n\nI wondered if the attention grabbing\
  \ display of my high pitch voice made the exit guard think my theory was indeed\
  \ a bogus. But did I care? No! I got the attend college."
