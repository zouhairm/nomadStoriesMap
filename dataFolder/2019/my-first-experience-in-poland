Text: "The first semester examinations that year were hectic. After my last paper,\
  \ I decided to travel to Poland for two weeks. Before booking my flight, I had to\
  \ call my friend Ozele if he would be ready to provide accommodation for me. He\
  \ willingly accepted without hesitation. Two hours before my flight, I was already\
  \ at the Fiumicino Airport Rome. I checked my luggage and got my boarding pass at\
  \ the check-in counter.\n\nIn less than 3hrs, the plane touched down at Chopin Airport.\
  \ Ozele was already at the entrance of the airport waiting for me. We greeted each\
  \ other warmly and drove to his house. The next day during breakfast, I asked him\
  \ if the bread we were eating was imported. I said, \u201CNo. It is a product of\
  \ Poland here in Radom.\u201D I was surprised. I never expected to see such quality\
  \ of bread in Poland. The bread was soft, moist, well baked and tangy. So far, that\
  \ was the best bread I had tasted in my life. Looking at me, he said, \u201CPoland\
  \ is the best bread producer in the world.\u201D I laughed and continued eating,\
  \ knowing full well that it was not true. In all the stories I had heard and read\
  \ from books about Poland, I was only captivated by the devastating effects of war\
  \ (World War II) to the country. I was expecting to see some remnants of war items\
  \ along the streets, dark soil or sand, burnt houses at the periphery of the town,\
  \ and poor infrastructure just like my first visit to the Republic Democratic of\
  \ Congo. But it was the contrary. \n\nThe weather was harsh and I had not bargained\
  \ for such a dramatic change. Deciding to brave the weather, I put on two winter\
  \ jackets and went out with Ozele. Radom, a small city found in the east-central\
  \ part of Poland, is a sprawling city, with many historical places and archaeological\
  \ monuments like the Cathedral of Virgin Mary, St. Wenceslaus Church, Bernadine\
  \ Church and Monastery, etc. The city was filled with straight streets that could\
  \ enable one to find his or her easily. The environment was clean. I liked the city\
  \ for its lively atmosphere, especially at night. Our means of transportation was\
  \ with public buses. They were comfortable just like in Rome. But the only difference\
  \ was that in Radom, you don\u2019t have to worry about traffic jams. They were\
  \ no street crime where one has to be conscious in public buses and looked out for\
  \ pickpockets.   \nI was opportune attend my first Sunday Mass at St. Wenceslaus\
  \ Church. A church that was built in the 13th century with wood, in a place which\
  \ was initially called \u201CThe Radom\u2019s Old Town Square.\u201D Its restoration\
  \ was made in the 1970s. This Church was like a single-nave building. But now, with\
  \ its gable roof and a neo-gothic turret with a steeple, stained glass windows with\
  \ religious and patriotic images, and a groin vault on the nave had given the church\
  \ a new look. All thanks to the designing works of Prof. Zin for the interior decoration\
  \ of the church.\n\nThe Jacek Malczewski Museum was another interesting place we\
  \ visited. An edifice founded in 1983 with four mighty pillars in front of its entrance.\
  \ All historic items there were perfectly in place with descriptions that were clear\
  \ to understand. Historical objects like weapons that were used in the World War\
  \ could be found also. Its fine arts collections were really something to write\
  \ home about. I really fell in love with most of the paintings.  \nThere were a\
  \ few places in Radom were one could find tasty local food at a cheaper price. Although,\
  \ some restaurants that were closed to archaeological places were overpriced. It\
  \ was really a dream come true for me, for I least expected what I saw at Radom,\
  \ in Poland."
