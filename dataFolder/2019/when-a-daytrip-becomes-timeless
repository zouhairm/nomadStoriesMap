Text: "I could never forget my trip to the Ecuadorian rainforest. I have been to Ecuador\
  \ twice, a colorful country where you can travel through the Andes to the sea level\
  \ in a few hours, but fortunately, altitude sickness can be relieved easily by sipping\
  \ coca tea. I have enjoyed the modern and historical beauties of Quito, touched\
  \ butterflies in Mindo, swum in the warm sea in Casablanca, climbed above 4,000\
  \ meters high in Cotopaxi National Park and bought the best tapestry in Otavalo.\
  \ So I believed I had known all about this country until I set off into the Amazonia.\n\
  I had spent some days at my brother\u2019s when my sister-in-law and I decided to\
  \ go on a low-cost trip to Ba\xF1os de Agua Santa, or simply, Ba\xF1os. We had heard\
  \ it was a touristic town in the heart of the country next to an intimidating active\
  \ volcano. We packed some summer clothes and took a bus. As soon as we arrived,\
  \ the night fell and it became unexpectedly cold. We went to bed longing for better\
  \ weather conditions the next day. \nIt was a rainy morning but we were so eager\
  \ to explore the place that we went hiking after a giant typical breakfast. While\
  \ sightseeing, a friendly Ecuadorian offered us a tour to the rainforest. Curiously,\
  \ we were always addressed in English even if we are also South American. We listened\
  \ to the agent carefully and, picturing the tour in our minds, we found ourselves\
  \ paying US$40 for a daytrip right away. \nThe following morning, we took a van\
  \ with some other tourists but we had the amusing privilege of sitting next to the\
  \ driver, who covered part of the journey with local stories and an improvised course\
  \ on slang and idioms. After about an hour and a half, we arrived to Puyo anxious\
  \ to undertake this low-budget-first approach to the jungle. Two tour guides welcomed\
  \ us. They were wearing camouflaged vests and shorts, looking rather far from the\
  \ version we had of Rambo or Tarzan, but they seemed to know that place like the\
  \ back of their hands. First stop: a monkey rescue center where hundreds of apes\
  \ were hanging around, playing and screaming. Some of them were caged, though. After\
  \ that, we visited a small native community and bought some of their colorful handcraft\
  \ made of feathers and seeds. From a small dock, we went canoeing down the river,\
  \ and we felt like traveling five hundred years backwards through time, with only\
  \ nature and heat around us.  \nAfter the ride, we headed to a huge Finca, a place\
  \ with a strange cave, a modest restaurant and some comfortable hammocks on top\
  \ of a hill. We enjoyed a breathtaking view of the Ecuadorian Amazonia, speechless.\
  \ Some risk takers got a chance at the swing to the sky, but there was no time for\
  \ everybody to experience this uncertain opportunity to fly. Ready for lunch, we\
  \ tasted typical food such as beans, rice \u2013rice is always present here, crunchy\
  \ fried bananas called Patacones, and some meat. We could not move easily after\
  \ that huge serving. Anyway, off we went to finish our excursion. This time we stepped\
  \ into the rainforest to learn more about its mysteries. We walked across several\
  \ tall but hollowed trees that served as telephones of the jungle. When the guide\
  \ hit the trunk, the sound could be heard miles away and that blew our urban minds!\
  \ We made some stops to see or smell healing leaves, and we even ate some insects.\
  \ At the end of the path, we did not expect to find a high, magnificent waterfall.\
  \ Relaxing underwater, we reflected on how life could be so different near the Equator,\
  \ and we wished this daytrip to become endless."
