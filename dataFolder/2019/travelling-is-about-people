Text: "In 2016 a friend and I decided to go on a trip together and chose India as\
  \ our main destination. After googling which cities to visit and buying all the\
  \ plane tickets we were good to go. Hotels, transportation? We decided to check\
  \ these things as soon we get to each city. In the worst case scenario, there is\
  \ always a bus station, airport or somewhere we could sleep for a night.\n\nJanuary\
  \ 1st, 2017. Happy New Year!! Fireworks and... 4am we were leaving Chopinzinho (a\
  \ small countryside city south Brazil). After a long car ride, first flight to S\xE3\
  o Paulo, airport swap, second flight to Abu Dhabi, third flight to New Delhi and,\
  \ finally, fourth flight to Leh.\n\nWe arrived in Leh on January 3rd at 3pm at one\
  \ of the smallest airports I ever crossed in my life. The temperature was around\
  \ -15\xBAC. The \"Tourist Information Counter\" was closed. It was low \"no\" season.\n\
  \nWell, we picked a \"cab\" and headed to down town in order to get more infos and\
  \ have a decent lunch. Stumbling around the only and main road we found out that\
  \ low season in Leh means that everything is closed. Although there are a dozen\
  \ of guest houses, they are all shut (abandoned), but we were able to find one open...\
  \ and completely booked.\n\nWhile walking back and looking for a restaurant in order\
  \ to sit down and decide our next move, a guy from one of the shops we stopped by,\
  \ called us back in, gave us two mugs of hot tea and asked if we succeeded in our\
  \ quest for a place to stay and if not, we were welcome to stay at his house with\
  \ his 6 cousins, if we didn't minded of it being very simple.\n\nHe seemed to be\
  \ a very nice guy, had a good \"energy\" and so we decided to accept the invitation.\
  \ It was already 6pm and getting very dark, so Ahmed closed the store and we stared\
  \ to go his place. While walking thru narrow passages, he was telling us that his\
  \ whole family is Kashmiri and makes pashminas, that are sold by them in this shop\
  \ in Leh and another one in Goa.\n\nAfter about 10 min we got to a two story straw\
  \ clay house, indeed simples, but not different then the others. We entered the\
  \ house and were happily greeted by two of Ahmed's cousins, which took our backpacks\
  \ and asked us to wash-up for dinner and go upstairs to the living room.\n\nThe\
  \ living room had only one shelf with some photos, a TV and some pillows on the\
  \ floor. Ahmed was there and told us to sit down, while he opened a table towel\
  \ onto the floor and his cousins bringing in plates and the pans with the food.\n\
  \nHe explained us what each food was and told us that they didn't have cutlery as\
  \ they are used to eat with their hands. The food was delicious!\n\nAfter dinner,\
  \ while Ahmed's cousins were taking out all the dishes, he brought us two \"ponchos\"\
  \ in order for us to be able to use them along with a coal pan and keep us warm\
  \ while watching TV.\n\nWe stayed there talking, laughing and having a delightful\
  \ night for a couple hours, still sleepiness was knocking us out.\n\nAhmed gave\
  \ us the his room, which already had two beds set-up. The beds were made of couple\
  \ blankets piled up and an electric on on top. He showed us how to use the blankets\
  \ and wished us a good night.\n\nWe are all still friends!"
