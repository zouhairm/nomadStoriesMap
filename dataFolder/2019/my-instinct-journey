Text: "Prior to my stay at the Happynest Hostel in Chiang Rai, I had been traveling\
  \ the islands and Chiang Mai with my husband and 6 other friends.\n\nNeedless to\
  \ say, we were rolling deep, which is a rare concept considering we\u2019re all\
  \ American and it\u2019s hard to get that many people together to head overseas,\
  \ let alone a weekend in Vegas!\n\nSo it came without saying, that when everyone\
  \ headed home to LAX.\n\nI stayed behind to trek Thailand solo for a week, I felt\
  \ alone and depressed.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, I was ecstatic to continue my\
  \ travels, but the thought of being alone after being so accompanied by, felt like\
  \ a shock in the weirdest way possible.\n\nThe 3-hour bus ride from Chiang Mai to\
  \ Chiang Rai was painful, even though I tried mercilessly to take my mind off it\
  \ by gazing out the window watching the beautiful Thai countryside pass me by.\n\
  \nI kept telling myself.\n\nA few breathing exercises and a short nap later, I arrived\
  \ in Chiang Rai. I got off the bus, dazed and confused, and it hit me. I snapped\
  \ out of the \u201Cpoor Chloe\u201D mode and into fight or flight more as I have\
  \ landed in a new city, unsure of where to go, and with no taxis in sight.\n\n \n\
  I\u2019m sure the look of worry showed on my face because before I know it, a police\
  \ officer that spoke broken English, was helping me locate a taxi.\n\nA smile came\
  \ across my face at the kindness of this sweet stranger and as I climbed into my\
  \ taxi, the young driver offered to drive me for free considering that Happynest\
  \ was right around the corner.\n\nA tear rolled down my cheek as I was thinking\
  \ about how silly I was for feeling down and my heart began to open up to the experience\
  \ of solo travels.\n\n\nWhen I arrived at Happynest, I was greeted with happy faces\
  \ and beautiful smiles at check-in (it\u2019s amazing what a smile can do!).\n\n\
  After checking into my amazing room, I went downstairs to grab a beer and peruse\
  \ the bookshelves for something .\n \nI picked up a Lonely Planet Thailand Travel\
  \ Guide book to help me plan for the remainder my trip.\n\nI cracked open the first\
  \ page and there it was, a forward written by three female travelers who had once\
  \ stayed at Happynest.\n\nThe forward struck me and I suddenly felt connected to\
  \ these women, even though we have never met, it was as if our paths had crossed\
  \ in one way or another.\n\n \nAnd there it was at the bottom of the note; one of\
  \ the travelers names was Chloe \u2013 like me.\n\nAt that moment, sitting alone\
  \ in my room, I suddenly didn\u2019t feel so alone.\n\nI felt as this was a sign\
  \ that I had made the right decision to travel solo.\n\nIt made me realize that\
  \ while the familiarities of home were over 6,000 miles away, that I could do this.\n\
  \nSo I got a good rest, started off the next morning with a pep in my step and kept\
  \ a smile on my face for the remainder of my trip"
