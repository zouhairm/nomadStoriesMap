Text: "No trip to Kyrgyzstan is complete without a trek through Aksu gorge, I was\
  \ told. And so, we, a group of 6 young men and women, decided to embark upon this\
  \ adventure, with nothing more than a backpack, a light jacket and a bottle of water.\
  \ As someone who had never climbed a mountain (or even a hill) at this point, this\
  \ hike was, by far, the greatest test of my physical endurance. Just 30 minutes\
  \ in, we were coughing and wheezing, and ready to give up!! I have never felt my\
  \ lungs strain against my chest that bad, never heard my heart beat that fast. My\
  \ body and my mind screamed bloody murder!\n\nThere was a constant screaming in\
  \ my head, telling me this was insane, this should stop, and that I can't do this\
  \ any longer. The cold air felt like a dagger as it pierced my chest. The rocks\
  \ and the boulders we had to climb were massive and it was unimaginable that such\
  \ a feat was even possible. Every now and then we would stop, and as we stopped,\
  \ we would take in the sight of beautiful wild horses, grazing, sunbathing and galloping\
  \ down the hill. Brown horses against the backdrop of green mountains. Oh, my heart!\
  \ \n\nThis gave me the strength. We treaded on, but the voices in my head grew louder.\
  \ The chatter \u2013 telling me that it was time to turn around, was persistent.\
  \ I was almost ready to give up, when suddenly, the noise was silenced. Suddenly,\
  \ it all vanished. Because suddenly, before my very eyes, lay paradise! \n\nWe came\
  \ upon the most unbelievable alpine lake I have ever set my eyes on - lake Suttu-Bulak.\
  \ \n\nNever have I seen such hues of green. Lakes were supposed to be blue, I thought.\
  \ But this was the most gorgeous shade of green I had ever laid my eyes on. A stunning\
  \ lake surrounded by mountains covered in my favorite tree \u2013 the conifer. Or\
  \ as I like to call it \u2013 the Christmas tree! Thousands and thousands of trees\
  \ surrounding this slice of untouched beauty. The silence, the serenity, the absolute\
  \ magic of God\u2019s creation.  \n\nIt's true, what they say, the greatest view\
  \ comes after the hardest climb!\n\nThe funny thing is, the moment we were done,\
  \ not one of us could remember how it felt climbing up. The pain and the trauma\
  \ were completely erased from our minds. The only memory I have, is of the beauty\
  \ of that moment! \n\nWe sat there, all spread out, listening to the sound of a\
  \ waterfall, lost deep in our thoughts. Lost in our own world of magic. \n\nA short\
  \ while later, rejuvenated, blissful and absolutely content, we were certain that\
  \ our adventure was through, and we headed back down; only to find ourselves in\
  \ the face of a full-blown hailstorm! My first ever hail, and I witness it while\
  \ we're out in the wilderness! Brilliant! \n\nCovered in nothing but a thin jacket,\
  \ we stood there, 6 young men and women, huddled under a tree, shaking with the\
  \ failing ice, the roaring thunder and striking lightning! Someone remembered that\
  \ we shouldn\u2019t stand under a tree in lightning, and so we had to get off from\
  \ under our protection and run back to safety. We ran back to the safety of our\
  \ yurt (a traditional Kyrgyz tent) - drenched, broken and frozen... and yet higher\
  \ than we've ever been.\n\nSomeone once told me that trekking is like childbirth.\
  \ The moment you\u2019re done, you forget the pain and you absolutely can\u2019\
  t wait to do it all over again! This moment was my first childbirth. This moment\
  \ gave me the strength to go on and, 2 months later, conquer Mt. Kilimanjaro! \n\
  \nMy doctor had told me that with lungs that function at just 63% capacity, if I\
  \ attempted to climb a mountain, I would die. I refused to believe him. \n\nI went.\
  \ I climbed. I lived. \n\nI truly believe that there is magic in every step of every\
  \ way. It is up to us to go forth and seek it!"
