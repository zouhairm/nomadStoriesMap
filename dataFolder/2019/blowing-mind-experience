Text: "I moved to Colombia in 2007. I first settled in Bogota, where it rained everyday\
  \ and I really did not enjoy it. However, I was working with Bomba Est\xE9reo, a\
  \ pretty famous band and I was the personal assistant for Liliana, the lead singer.\
  \ I told her how much I had dreamt about coconuts and palm trees and how the bad\
  \ weather from Bogota discouraged me. That\u2019s when she recommended me to go\
  \ to Barranquilla, in the Atlantic coast. That\u2019s when all the magic started!!\
  \ I arrived to Barranquilla after a long bus trip to discover a wonderful beach\
  \ under the most shining sun. I got to Salgar, a coast town where I always had a\
  \ coconut for breakfast. I was hired to be the producer for La Puntica No M\xE1\
  , a group of artists who make the greatest and craziest performance on the 40th\
  \ road for carnival every year. I believe this was the happiest time in life ever!!\
  \ To be part of these bunch of people and to be able to march in the parade with\
  \ them, you have to create your own character based on a theme they propose. I remember\
  \ the first time I worked with the theme was \u201Cstardust\u201D. So baring this\
  \ in mind, you have to charactize this idea and produce your own costume and mask.\
  \ You even have to perform your creation. You suggest an idea and they provide you\
  \ feedback. There are workshops organized, African music played in every meeting,\
  \ champetta being danced.  I was surrounded by feathers, glitter, happiness. You\
  \ can smell the carnival in the air. There is a rueda de cumbia in every neighborhood.\
  \ It\u2019s just an amazing experience. It renews your soul, energies and fills\
  \ you with joy and love. There\u2019s a saying in Barranquilla \u201Cquien lo vive,\
  \ es quien lo goza\u201D. It means: \u201Cyou need to experience the carnival to\
  \ completely understand\u201D and I couldn\u2019t agree more."
