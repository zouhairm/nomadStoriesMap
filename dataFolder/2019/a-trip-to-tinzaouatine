Text: "I was in  Tamanraseet, the  largest  state in Algeria.There is 2000 kilometer\
  \ far from the capital Algiers. My plan : travel to the municipality  Tinzaouatine.\
  \ It is located  at  border between Algeria and Mali. There is 360 kilometer ,separated\
  \ Tamanraseet.\nEarly in the morning, i went  to the station of cars,  a kind of\
  \ bare ground , except a tins of gasoline as plate of indication. The clandestine\
  \  drivers carry a persons to Tinzaouatine.I found three men dressed in bazin,a\
  \ tradicional cloth of Touaregue, wich are desert people ,ancient human race,nomadic,that\
  \ we can found them until Burkinafaso.Their nickname, is \xAB blue man \xBB ,by\
  \ means of the blue  color of bazin.\nMany Touaregue like this color.I asked the\
  \ man ,who was seated in the middle : \xABHello sir,when did the first transporter,go\
  \ to Tinzaouatine \xBB\nThe targui answred : \xAB this afternoon,it remains two\
  \ empty places only  \xBB.\nThere is a manner wich manage the transportation, the\
  \ driver wait to the full of places of vehicle,many are old Toyota ,those ones carry\
  \ 06 places , 02 in the front and 04 in behind.\nOften, the places take at least\
  \ ,one day or two days.After,a call of the man of station, i arrived with my backpack,i\
  \ took a place fortunately near the driver,and the men beside me was puny.The other\
  \ persons, were refugees.A trip started.A bad odour knock my nose,wich was a mixture\
  \ of gasoline and sweet of men.The music of Tinariween band ,famous in sahara,tickled\
  \ my ears.Some kilometer rossed,a gendarm made sigin in order to stop,and asked\
  \ the automobilist for officials papers.\nIn order to prevent,the shakedone, the\
  \ driver slipped two papers of money such as a bribe.The result : officer let us\
  \ gone consecuently.\xB2\nLater,after we crossed 80 kilometer on paved road, the\
  \ diver took the no tarred one.It was inferno .Different color of stones : gray,brown\
  \ ,even black. Diverse size and form :small,big,pointed,pealed. Gully of sand form\
  \ grooves,wich make car tremble and vibrate.In a car ,you must held your self :to\
  \ any thing ,or else you was beaten, like a ball of tennis.\nWe lost around 03 hours,due\
  \ to the out break of wheels,and the sandblasting,and we must give hand.sometimes.we\
  \ were in the violent sand storm and far and far we beheld a military ,they struggle\
  \  differents : groups,terrorists,smugglers,bandits, and we were happy ,they had\
  \ not check us.\nThe sahara of Algeria , become a teater of traffics : drugs,arms,gasoline,foodstuffs.The\
  \ people are between the fire of army and the anvil of criminals.The time of peace\
  \ and love is over.\nOn the other hand,immensity of desert ,greatness of mountains,beaty\
  \ of oasis,diversity of animals species : gazells,fennacs,hares\u2026.took your\
  \ mind in another dimension.All that ,procure happinessand joy. A world a part,it\
  \ conquers your soul.\nIn the sunset, we took rest.The transporter prepared the\
  \ dinner.Every one took a bottle of water, and went to the natural toilet.After\
  \ we had finished a prayer,we sat in order to eat.The feast consisted of camel meat,vegetable\
  \ broth and pie.The last one ,was cooked in hole of sand,and covered with coals.The\
  \ name of this repats is Tagella, a targui food.We finished with a hot cup of green\
  \ tea.\nLater in the naight,we arrived at Tinzaouatine,it was asleep.The trip was\
  \ finished.One proverb says :\nEach begining has a end and this end is the begining\
  \ of smething else.Goodbye.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n."
