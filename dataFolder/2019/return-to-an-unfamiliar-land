Text: "So many things were foreign about the scene around me. For starters, we were\
  \ pre-drinking from liquor bottles in the middle of a public square, right outside\
  \ the National Theatre in Prague. An activity both illegal and impossible to do\
  \ at home. I was surrounded by smoke, laughter, and conversations that I couldn\u2019\
  t understand - yet at the same time, the rhythm of the Czech language echoed childhood\
  \ memories of my Baba and D\u011Bda back in Canada.\n\nIt was my first time visiting\
  \ Prague: the city of my grandparents, where my mother was born. Her family had\
  \ fled the Czech Republic during the Prague Spring in 1968 and settled as immigrants\
  \ in Canada soon after. The Czech Republic was only one stop of many in my multi-month,\
  \ solo European backpacking trip. Even so, I was intensely aware of the significance\
  \ of returning to a place that forms such an integral part of my family\u2019s history.\n\
  \nIn general, travelling alone as an introvert is incredibly rewarding, but I was\
  \ nervous when I arrived in Prague. Armed only with generic travel blog advice and\
  \ the vague, decades old recollections of my mother, I wasn\u2019t sure how to make\
  \ the most of my time there, even though I desperately needed to connect with the\
  \ city. \n\nThen by luck, or by fate, I was randomly assigned a hostel room with\
  \ an exceptionally friendly roommate. Not only did she enthusiastically befriend\
  \ me within minutes of meeting, earlier that day she had also connected with a local\
  \ university student who invited her to an architecture and design showcase. We\
  \ headed out together that evening. \n\nI quickly realized that the showcase would\
  \ be a crash course on nightlife and culture in Prague. It was a whirlwind of music,\
  \ drinks, dancefloors and art. Never before or after that night have I been to a\
  \ school event with students presenting their coursework to professors just steps\
  \ away from beer stands and DJ\u2019s. It was shockingly different from the conservative\
  \ professional settings I was familiar with, but incredible to experience from within\
  \ how boldly different two cultures can be.\n\nOf course the night didn\u2019t end\
  \ there. We moved on to the National Theatre: a 150 year old cultural centerpoint\
  \ in Prague, a monument to a rich artistic tradition, which had been rented and\
  \ converted into a nightclub to host the after party for the showcase. So I found\
  \ myself part of a large group of people, enjoying the night in the presence a Czech\
  \ national landmark. I realized that my grandparents hadn\u2019t been much older\
  \ than I was when they left Prague, and felt just how close they were in the voices\
  \ of the Czech natives surrounding me."
