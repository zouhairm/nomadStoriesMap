Text: "Travelling was like a forbidden fruit for me, belonging to a conservative family\
  \ I had always been just a part of solo trips. Until in Octobed 2017 I travelled\
  \ to a place called bir billing in himachal Pradesh, a state in India. \n\nWell\
  \ to start with the story begins in a very cliche manner where I was in college\
  \ and all my friends use to plan trips but those trips never really came into action\
  \ just like the thunder lightening it used to come and go. But I was really dwelling\
  \ into the fact about the hidden things undiscovered, ofcourse by me which I personally\
  \ have not seen, I am not possibly going to discover a hidden sea route in India;)\
  \ \nSo I was determined that I will bring the last cancelled plan into action even\
  \ if it means going alone. I tried very hard to convince my parents that they allow\
  \ me to go forward with the trip. In the end I did get that over-rated permission\
  \ from them and I went on the trip not knowing anyone and anything about travelling,\
  \ like I mean literally I did not know the ABC of travelling.\nStill I wanted to\
  \ experience the best of the places so I booked up a group travel plan, these where\
  \ you pay the money and travel with a group. The means of transportation was a bus\
  \ so I went to the bus station and waited for the trip organiser and wanted to greet\
  \ him. In that very simple way I had met four people by then and we were exchanging\
  \ jokes.\nOn our way in the bus there was a session where everyone was introducing\
  \ themselves and hobbies, the general stuff. We had a gala time singing making fun\
  \ and everything. By then I knew this trip will be fun. We took a stop for dinner\
  \ at a local restaurant and we all sat together and ate. We reached in the morning\
  \ to the place we were supposed to stay for the next two days. \nAnd the amazing\
  \ part was that our stay was on tents and yes I love tents specially that part was\
  \ which excited me. We freshener up and went on a 12 km trek to the top of the hill,\
  \ and ohh trust me it was so slippery and foggy as it has just rained, the weather\
  \ was so beautiful. I was specially talling to four people, you can call that my\
  \ travel group. So we shared our stories and by the time we came back it was night\
  \ and we were drinking and playing truth and dare in the tents, with all the intresting\
  \ questions. The pesk part of these trips is the bonfire isn't it, we were dancing\
  \ around the bonfire to music. Then we slept for the next big day being the paragliding\
  \ over the mountain valley. Well yes that is what the place Bir Billing famous for.\
  \ A girl had already gotten hurt before my chance which made my heart race. But\
  \ i still gathered the courage to do it and trust me the view that I had seen was\
  \ worth it, for the first time in my life I had experienced something like that.\n\
  \nWell yes that was it, that was that so called life changing short trip I had.\
  \ But I guess it was really powerful in my life, since that trip I have done many\
  \ solo trips and this time even with my friends from my first trip. I had learnt\
  \ si many things I mean it might sound stupid but I learnt about how should you\
  \ trek, about how the bonfire stays longer, how to keep yourself warm, how to communicate,\
  \ how to explore. \nNow I can go everywhere alone and people ask me how, I say I\
  \ learnt it myself and gave myself a whole new outlook of seeing things and that\
  \ they should also do it.\nDon't we all learn from the smll things."
