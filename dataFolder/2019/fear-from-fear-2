Text: "As the clouds surfaced across, it paced us towards this beautiful land - Ooty.\
  \ Ooty is one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. This place has\
  \ always been an iconic part of the Bollywood films in the era of 1990s. A serene\
  \ destination with an exquisite weather was a quite a relief from the hot summers\
  \ we had to suffer down in Hyderabad. An intriguing ride into the forests of Mudumalai\
  \ made us relive the flora and fauna the country has. We crossed the border of Karnataka\
  \ and entered the Tamil Nadu border. \n\nThe Tamil Nadu border welcomed us into\
  \ the state with its fresh smell of eucalyptus and many other herbal plants from\
  \ its living range of hills, the Nilgiris. The Nilgiris, being a home to innumerable\
  \ variants of roses, trees and herbs mesmerized us with its beauty in a way like\
  \ no other. The most interesting part for all of my friends and I was the homemade\
  \ chocolates the localities made. The chocolates were delicious and we could not\
  \ stop pampering ourselves with the variants available. \n\nOn our way to Ooty,\
  \ the driver took us through the hilly roads which made my little ghost come out\
  \ of me only to haunt for the next 2-3 days of our stay. Yes, that is what you have\
  \ exactly read- a ghost. Being an acrophobic since a child, I always feared of climbing\
  \ heights as I always dreamt of falling from great heights.\n\nThe actual day when\
  \ my fear was put to test was when we had to trek to visit Doddabetta- the highest\
  \ peak of the Nilgiris at an elevation of 2,637 metres. The point was also famously\
  \ acclaimed as the \u2018Suicide point\u2019. Hearing about the number of suicide\
  \ cases occurred at this point made me all the more nervous. Everyone was quite\
  \ excited about it but I wasn\u2018t, my head started feeling dizzy and all of a\
  \ sudden I felt very uncomfortable. The thought of climbing up to one of the dangerous\
  \ points made me itself of giving me certain psychological impressions and in a\
  \ few minutes I was asking myself \u2018What if I fell down?\u2019 I was somewhere\
  \ doubtful of my dreams of myself falling would come true and I sat like as if I\
  \ froze. Seeing my condition going pathetic, my friends indulged in asking me for\
  \ my condition, to which I had to disclose this petty secret of mine which I had\
  \ never revealed to anyone. Hearing this, my friends burst into laughter and I felt\
  \ a little disgraced and was fuming for taking out my phobia so lightly. That\u2019\
  s when our driver told us that we had reached our destination and from then on we\
  \ had to trek. \nInitially, reluctant because of my phobia, I was not willing and\
  \ wanted to stay back. That\u2019s when my friend had asked me one question which\
  \ changed the way I perceived my fear as- The only thing she asked me was sternly,\
  \ \u201CTill when?\u201D This question made me go deep inside myself; I took a moment\
  \ to ask me \u201CWhether I need to suffer from this phobia every time?\u201D, \u201C\
  When would I could overcome my fear?, All these questions in my mind motivated me\
  \ to overcome my fear as this was probably the chance I got. I lifted my pace and\
  \ walked along with my friends. As we kept going higher, I had to face my fear and\
  \ my confidence hand in hand. Throughout the way, I kept saying \u201CJust go for\
  \ it and conquer it\u201D.  We trekked for around 20 minutes and the paths got narrower.\
  \ I could realize that I was at a great height making me even more anxious and finally\
  \ we reached the spot. \nFor a moment, the breathtaking view of Ooty made me forget\
  \ all my anxieties. It surprised me that I had conquered the fear that confided\
  \ in me all these years. The voice which I could finally hear was \u2018The ability\
  \ to overcome our fear is only possible with the force within us\u201D. It is only\
  \ when you stand up bravely, your fear from your fear vanishes and your fear remains\
  \ no more as your fear."
