Text: I love to travel and explore the different types of cultures and wilderness
  and how much they revive one another. I am passionate about the entire world and
  everyone in it. I also have a passion for explore the different types of religion
  and spiritual growth in each culture of the world and how there governed. I am passionate
  about tasting the different foods from different cultures. I am passionate about
  the preservation of the animals and there domain. I am passionate about how different
  types of cultures and ethnicity protect there land and resources and how they live
  "green" I just overall love exploring life and where it takes me. I am from the
  United States of America and have explored most of the western part of the country
  and want to experience the world in a way that will not harm the culture or land
  in it. I am a huge animal lover so I'm passionate about keeping there domain clean
  and natural. This world we live in is so beautiful the only way to show it is to
  film it and document it and preserve the land unexplored and keep it natural as
  it was before exploring it. I'm thankful for all the blessings of the Lord's love
  and the sacrifices he gave us. we must return the same values to the Lord and everything
  the Lord created.
