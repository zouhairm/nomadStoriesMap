Text: "Hello I am Farhan Ali, a graduate from Shah Abdul Latif University Khairpur.\
  \ I live in Sukkur which is the 3rd big city of Sindh province.\nSukkur is known\
  \ as a city of saints & River Indus. River Indus is one of the longest river in\
  \ Asia. Before starting my untold story & unexpected story let me take you to the\
  \ dream that is very important. I belong from Militant family background; my father\
  \ has served the nation for 39 years of his life. My all brothers are serving in\
  \ Pakistan Army, Navy & Airforce, So that my whole family wanted me to serve the\
  \ nation as well rather this it was also my dream to serve the nation to protect\
  \ my beloved homeland Pakistan. When, I was 16 years old, I was very much ready\
  \ for my career's first test for GDP (General Duty Pilot) in Airforce. I remembered\
  \ that they when i was supposed to leave the home for the test my Ami (Mama) kissed\
  \ on my forehead & said (Allah Pak Tumhain Kamiyabi Dey) May God Bless you with\
  \ Success & gave me a hug. My father, who was retired from Pakistan Army wished\
  \ me good luck and accompanied me to the Airforce recruitment Center. Somehow, I\
  \ was very much excited for the test & was bit nervous because it was my first time\
  \ that i was recruiting for General Duty Pilot in Pakistan Airforce. However I entered\
  \ in the recruitment center, as i entered a security guard checked me and allowed\
  \ me to proceed for further formalities. Than further i proceeded to the clerk for\
  \ document verification, after verification I proceeded to test hall.\nMy excitement\
  \ turned into nervousness. After a lot of wait now it was my turn to get in the\
  \ test hall. I remember as i was instructed to bring a black marker and a piece\
  \ of paper for rough work & a recruitment slip, I has followed the instructions.\
  \ I get in the test hall; I allotted a computer PC because it was online based test.\
  \ I put my file bag on the desk; I opened it and took my recruitment slip & marker.\
  \ It was very important day for me. The time started for the test all the candidates\
  \ were nervous as i saw them, But everyone has faith in God. By the name of Allah\
  \ (God) I initiated test the first part was of Intelligence. It was very easy for\
  \ me because i as mentioned above i was totally ready for this test. After 45 minutes\
  \ i cleared first round of my test & initiated 2nd portion that was of English Alhamdulillah\
  \ (thanking God) I cleared both rounds but now it was turn of the tough one the\
  \ third was of Physics as i was not good at Physics. Unfortunately I couldn't qualify\
  \ the 3rd round and was knocked-out from test hall. I got really very much disappoint\
  \ from myself & cried. Where my Mom my father were just expecting me & believing\
  \ me that I\u2019ll clear the test but i couldn't fulfill their wish.\nBut I didn't\
  \ lost hope, I worked hard, I studied hard, I waited for 2 years to get more & more\
  \ ready for the next test. I struggled to improve my all subjects, & on only just\
  \ mentally, I improved myself as physical. I use to jog for 2 times morning & evening;\
  \ I boosted my stamina and was fully ready for next test.\nNow this was the time\
  \ to enjoy the victory and make my parents proud on me.\nI was just waiting for\
  \ the recruitment for Pakistan Navy & yes this was the time that i was waiting for;\
  \ this time my parents & all my fellows wished me. I was fully confident. I went\
  \ for the recruitment completed all the requirements went in the test hall & this\
  \ time all the questions that i attempted were very easy. After 20 days result announced\
  \ on the Pakistan Navy Official Website & this time I passed my test got cleared\
  \ from all tests. My whole family & my fellow cheered this time & congratulate me!\
  \ In this way joined Pakistan Navy & fulfilled the dream of my parents to serve\
  \ the nation.\nNo struggle can ever succeed without women participating side by\
  \ side with men"
