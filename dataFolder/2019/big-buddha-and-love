Text: "I was the only girl on this tour and Sloan was our tour guide. To say the least\
  \ I am happy to find out going to sleep was a better idea. Seems Blair was not the\
  \ only one that had a wild night, Sholeh told me about his night, he decided to\
  \ check out the ping pong show. Thankfully he\u2019s one of my favorite people on\
  \ this trip so I gave him a hard time . The conversations that we\u2019re had on\
  \ this ride to go see the were quite interesting!!! Since majority of my friends\
  \ back home are men, so i can handle the conversation. We pull up to the grounds!\
  \ It is surrounded in the middle of lush beautiful foliage, tropical plants and\
  \ huge trees. Before you enter the grounds there are giant brass gongs you rub for\
  \ good luck they say if you make music when you rub it fast enough the higher the\
  \ luck. He is perched on a hill between kata and chalong. The sight of him is absolutely\
  \ breathtaking he is 45 Meters High which mean that is 147 ft tall he\u2019s made\
  \ of reinforced cement and overlaid with Burmese white Jade marble. Regardless of\
  \ how many tourists it is absolutely magical and very peaceful. The viewpoint overlooks\
  \ the town and chalong Bay it is absolutely magnificent. You climb quite a bit of\
  \ stairs and once you get closer to the top there are other smaller Buddhas made\
  \ of brass. I get lost in a Wonderland of peaceful chimes. Sholeh and I head inside\
  \ the temple of course you have to be covered with in Thai culture you are not allowed\
  \ to show your knees or your shoulders as a cultural thing and respect to the monks.\
  \ Inside the temple it was gorgeous it was  covered in gold and red .  There was\
  \ a lounging tabby cat basking in the sun rays that were blaring through from the\
  \ nearest doorway. The cat had it been the most come and relax cat I've ever have\
  \ seen we take pictures of the kitty of course\n I take my sandals off after I have\
  \ taken pictures for sholeh. I walk towards the Monk, kneel on my knees and give\
  \ my donation. I take a deep breath. I feel this sinsation that took over as i closed\
  \ my crystal blye eyes. The monk dressed in a saffron colored robe. These robes\
  \ they wear date back in centuries. In southwest Asian they wear saffron unlike\
  \ in tibet they wear maroon. The blessing starts, he chants a prayer in thai, not\
  \ much knowledge as to what he says. But thailand is the land of smiles, i am most\
  \ certain it is for protection and happiness. After the blessing The monk wraps\
  \ a multicolored braided bracelet. It is said once the bracelet breaks off that\
  \ is when unfinished business has been settled. He washes me with Sacred Water and\
  \ says his Blessing. That was by far the most invigorating experience I have been\
  \ through. I put my hands together and bow from middle chest to forehead giving\
  \ thanks. I open my eyes and the sun hit the back of my back I feel the enlightment.\
  \ I stand up and strap my sandals on. I walk out.  There was another man there named\
  \ Felipe he is from Brazil. He was on vacation from work it\u2019s so crazy how\
  \ much you learn about other countries and culture. The passion and struggle certain\
  \ people deal with day to day I've come to realize where I come from and what opportunities\
  \ i have in my life. I am forever grateful. When you exit out of the temple, I see\
  \ a beautiful older woman, her wrinkles and soft skin tell a story and her kind\
  \ smile. She was selling like most things Thailand these hand crafted brass leafs.\
  \ You buy one and hang them on the sacred tree.  The tree is filled with little\
  \ brass leafs, from lovers, from people need a blessing, from happiness and love.\
  \ I write my blessings and good thoughts to those who I love and who I have met\
  \ in life and on this journey. It was one of my most loving moments."
