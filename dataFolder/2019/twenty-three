Text: "I definitely felt the orange-pink-lilac sunrise was a special gift to me for\
  \ waking up so early in that soon to be rainy Saturday. The train was going to Carcassonne,\
  \ south of France, where I hoped to find a 12th century castle surrounded by a remarkable\
  \ medieval citadel. The tourism information centre was closed, my phone had zero\
  \ data and I was certain I could walk to the castle by myself. After half an hour\
  \ of getting wet and closer to the opposite side, I left my pride aside and asked\
  \ for assistance. \nThe nearest place I found with living beings was a local bar\
  \ with the kind of people who goes to a bar at 9 am. Also known as people who most\
  \ probably have time to exchange some words with me, I thought. My French, however,\
  \ was as terrible as their English and the conclusion was unknown to my understanding\
  \ till nowadays. Yet the next action I witness was an old bold man grabbing his\
  \ keys and opening the door of his car parked just in front of the establishment.\
  \ I turned to the bar owner expecting instructions or confirmations and he simply\
  \ points out to the awaiting door. Sure, great, merci, bye.  \nAfter five minutes\
  \ of silence in this stranger\u2019s moving car, I start to think if this was exactly\
  \ the kind of situation my mom would kill me for. Well, maybe the sunrise was so\
  \ beautiful because it was my last one. No. I was convinced he was a good man trying\
  \ to be nice because I just felt he was a good man trying to be nice. Lost in my\
  \ philosophical thoughts of humans being kind by nature, I was interrupted by a\
  \ voila and two staring eyes. I check outside and see the only thing I could recognize\
  \ from the city: the train station. I politely thanked him and left the kind man\
  \ behind. It was just not the place I wanted to go but better not complain. So here\
  \ I go, walking some more on the other, and presumingly, right direction. \nNot\
  \ even fifteen minutes pass by and a red mini cooper starts following me. Not sure\
  \ if I run in reverse route, if I stop and pretend a call or if I ignore it. The\
  \ window comes down and I hear a young voice screaming through the light rain. \u2018\
  Hey, girl from the bar! Did my uncle give you a ride to the wrong place?\u2019 Okay,\
  \ that was a bit weird but the information was correct. So yeah, I shake my head\
  \ with a smile as he opens the passenger door and invites me in. Really? Am I doing\
  \ this again? Absolutely. \nOur communication was a mix of all the languages we\
  \ knew as a duo and tons of hands\u2019 explaining. As we wheel up the hill I felt\
  \ grateful I didn\u2019t have to do it on feet, such a na\xEFve little traveller\
  \ I can be sometimes. The engine turns off, the guy whose name I never really asked\
  \ comes out and walks me to the castle\u2019s entrance. I was practicing my thank-you-goodbye\
  \ sentence when he continues to walk by my side inside the ancient walls. It turns\
  \ out he had some spare time and felt like giving me a tour. If I was to be suspicious,\
  \ I would expect to be asked for tips in the end, which at this point I was fine\
  \ with. But the only thing he did was to apologize for the lack of precise information,\
  \ names and dates. He lived in the city for long but only came to the citadel a\
  \ few times. That was it, he wished me luck and turned back towards the parking\
  \ lot.  \nI sat under a wide dripping tree with a hot chocolate warming my hands.\
  \ It was a day to reflect about being open to kindness, about feeling others\u2019\
  \ good intentions and not letting the bad wolf from Little Red Riding Hood take\
  \ over my judgements all the time. The weather was awful, the circumstances could\
  \ have led me to different scenarios, but all I could think of is that I had a great\
  \ birthday."
