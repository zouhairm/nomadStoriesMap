Text: "I momentarily stopped before stepping onto the plane. Those night hues were\
  \ reflected on the glass of a window in terminal 2, that was when I saw my silhouette.\
  \ In my left hand was a book of poems that had been helping me to reconnect with\
  \ my imperfect body. Cuba was my immediate move after 12 months of lying prostrate\
  \ in a bed because of an accident. I used to be a professional dancer, or at least\
  \ it was the way I defined myself. \n\nI arrived in Havana on the Wednesday just\
  \ before the referendum election; there were many \u201CYes\u201D papers on the\
  \ street but a feeling of \u201CNo\u201D from the majority. I booked four days of\
  \ dancing and living experience at Olga\u2019s. As I walked through the entrance\
  \ of the house I saw many pictures in black and white of Olga\u2019s team; and a\
  \ painting of a dark-skinned woman moving her hips to the left, posing with her\
  \ arms on her head. I pretended to be a typical customer in the house. A person\
  \ that does not know how to dance and how to move. After all, I even have trouble\
  \ carrying my luggage to the second floor. \n\nKarin was the instructor. A mid-aged\
  \ heavily built man. It was not a big bunch of people; we were the perfect number\
  \ seven, from all around the world. As the days went by it wasn\u2019t just me,\
  \ it was we. The Casino-Salsa-10- steps every day helped the symbiotic lineup. As\
  \ I sank or swam into those steps I cast aside my inhibitions. The psychological\
  \ pain started to melt away.  \n\nCuban streets were for Cubans. Party, carnival,\
  \ and pleasure were the principles. While walking on my way to the class I saw an\
  \ afro-haired little girl. She was following some dancers in the Plaza as she started\
  \ to imitate their movements. They looked like they were her first dance movements,\
  \ but that rhythm was in her blood. I instinctively mirrored her, rediscovering\
  \ those actions with lightness and grace.\n\nBefore I had my last dancing class\
  \ I decided to make a stop at \u201CLa Bodeguita del Medio\u201D. I needed to lose\
  \ myself, so a Mojito or two would be a good option. I smiled at the bartender who\
  \ was making eight Mojitos in a row. \n\n\u201CDid Hemingway write in here?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\nFinishing the preparation of the jungle-inside-looking drink, he answered:\
  \ \n\u201CHe left some minutes ago\u201D. \nI took that for granted and after three\
  \ and a half drinks I went dancing.\n\nIt was a rainy day. An unusual one for Cubans.\
  \ Rain means the end of party, carnival, and pleasure in the streets for them. As\
  \ for us, we were dancing in the tiled room doing the ten-steps Casino. When the\
  \ rain came, we saw it through the window next to us. Karin with his usual excited\
  \ way said: \n\u201CLet\u2019s go and dance in the street\u201D to his old fashioned\
  \ radio.\n \nHe, the teacher, left the class and we, the students, just had to follow\
  \ him in a Conga line. The rain increased to a downpour. We changed from the Conga\
  \ to the Casino round circle. We were all soaking wet from the pouring rain. We\
  \ started to make the circle movement way faster. By now, we had the choreography\
  \ in our bones and veins. In the middle of the bending backward movement, when the\
  \ rain was hitting my face, I looked up and saw some neighbors standing on their\
  \ balconies staring at us with trepidation. Locked in that position I could see\
  \ the afro-haired little girl standing on the balcony alone. A courageous one. Her\
  \ mother tried to take her off the balcony, and I shouted with my head still inverted\
  \ \u201CBring her here\u201D in Spanish: \u201CTr\xE1igala ac\xE1.\u201D \n\nKarin\
  \ then explained to me that people were so scared during the rain, which has caused\
  \ many houses to collapse and that was the reason why there were no souls in the\
  \ wet street. \n\nNow I am at the gate again. \n\nMy poem book is in my backpack\
  \ this time."
