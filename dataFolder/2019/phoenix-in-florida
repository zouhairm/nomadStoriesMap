Text: "I\u2019ll be honest: when my mom sent \u201CForget the Dates\u201D to 80% of\
  \ my brother\u2019s wedding guests, I suspected it had more to do with her feelings\
  \ about the bride than any actual destruction.\n\nBut now, driving through a haunting\
  \ tessellation of wooden triangles, I see she wasn\u2019t exaggerating. Six months\
  \ ago, this was a timber farm\u2013until Hurricane Michael snapped every pine in\
  \ half, but for a thin ream of bark connecting top to bottom. \n\nContinuing along\
  \ 98, which connects Panama City to Florida\u2019s Forgotten Coast, we pass FEMA\
  \ trailers, skeletal remains of homes, and heaps of ruined couches, mattresses,\
  \ and refrigerators awaiting disposal. Each reinforces the impossibility of the\
  \ task before us:\n\nMy brother is getting married this week, and all we\u2019ve\
  \ managed to confirm is the caterer.\n\nI try to think positive. \u201CSmall\u201D\
  \ is what Andrew wanted. That\u2019s why he picked the Sunshine State\u2019s longest,\
  \ most pristine, and least crowded beach town, Cape San Blas, for his destination\
  \ wedding. The complete lack of high rises means visitors can see the Gulf of Mexico\
  \ and Saint Joseph Bay at the same time. It takes five minutes to walk between bodies\
  \ of saltwater\u2013all along sandy streets that boast more golden retrievers than\
  \ vehicles. \n\nHowever, passing deserted storefronts with claim numbers spray-painted\
  \ across boarded-up windows, I doubt this is what Andrew had in mind. \n\nI get\
  \ straight to work, scouting which businesses have reopened in Port St. Joe\u2019\
  s downtown. It takes two blocks to find a single unlocked door.\n\n\u201CMorning!\u201D\
  \ the bartender pipes as I enter. (\u201CMorning\u201D is an overstatement. Slightly.)\n\
  \n\u201CHi! I\u2019m in town for my brother\u2019s wedding. We need\u2026basically\
  \ everything. Do you know anyone who might bartend this Saturday?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  THIS Saturday?\u201D she chortles, jotting names on a napkin while two patrons listen\
  \ in.\n\n\u201CYou know,\u201D one drawls, \u201CMy son dated a photographer in\
  \ Apalachicola. I can connect you, if you\u2019d like.\u201D\n\nThe other interjects,\
  \ \u201CI\u2019ll call the lady who owns the flower shop. It looks closed\u2013\
  but I\u2019m sure she\u2019d do some arrangements.\u201D\n\nSoon, John, Todd, and\
  \ Jessica have shared names of almost everyone I\u2019d need to make this wedding\
  \ happen. Todd even called a friend of a friend at Chamber of Commerce; she emailed\
  \ a comprehensive list of all reopened businesses and restaurants. It\u2019s like\
  \ I have my own team of wedding planners! \n\nI thank them for their help, but Jessica\
  \ shushes me. \u201CThere\u2019s not a lot of weddings now, and there\u2019s not\
  \ much work. We want you to have a good time, because we will NOT be flattened by\
  \ some silly storm.\u201D\n\nWe toast to that, then I get busy making calls.\n\n\
  The next morning, I face a different kind of task: building an arbor for the wedding\
  \ ceremony. I\u2019d planned to stop by the hardware store, but stumbled upon an\
  \ estranged trellis during my morning run. Reduce, reuse, recycle, right? \n\nDragging\
  \ the lattice through powdery white sand towards my surprisingly-affordable beachfront\
  \ rental, my muscles burn. A nose nudges my knee as Buddy, a(nother) golden retriever,\
  \ heralds his dad\u2019s golf cart. \n\n\u201CHi, Jim!\u201D I wave to the spry\
  \ retiree. (It\u2019s only been a day, but everyone knows everyone on this beach.)\n\
  \n\u201CNeed help?\u201D \n\nWe load the trellis and begin driving, Buddy trotting\
  \ by my side as dolphins splash about six meters offshore. \u201CI can\u2019t believe\
  \ this area is so\u2026 Forgotten!\u201D I gasp.\n\n\u201CYou know why, right?\u201D\
  \ Jim laughs.\n\n\u201CNope.\u201D\n\n\u201CThirty years ago, a major atlas accidentally\
  \ buried this stretch of the Gulf in a page-fold. The publisher apologized and offered\
  \ to re-print, but the whole town said, \u2018No, thanks! We like it this way!\u2019\
  \u201D\n\nJim stays until he\u2019s sure I have every tool I could possibly need\
  \ to complete this project. Restarting his golf cart, he muses, \u201CThis would\
  \ look fantastic surrounded by lightning conch and pear whelks. Walk three minutes\
  \ in either direction tomorrow morning. You\u2019ll find more shells than you need.\u201D\
  \n\nA whirlwind of tasks (and world-famous oysters) later, I see Jim again\u2013\
  this time, blinking back tears as my brother kisses his bride.  \n\nLooking around\
  \ the ceremony at the locals we\u2019ve befriended this week, I smile. As much as\
  \ they allegedly wanted to stay off the map\u2026 it\u2019s obvious that if you\
  \ show up, you're family."
