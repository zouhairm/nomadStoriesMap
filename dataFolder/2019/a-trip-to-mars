Text: "It was one of those epiphanies I would remember for a long time \u2013 sitting\
  \ on my $15 Goodwill couch, wondering where my life was headed. For the last four\
  \ years, it had been marriage, a quiet life in northern Wisconsin, and the boring\
  \ everyday monotony that came along with that compromise. \nBut that day, after\
  \ losing what I thought was my future, I needed a change. I decided to head west.\
  \ \n\nUnfortunately, there literally was no money. I had about $1000 to play with,\
  \ and very few friends willing to travel across the country with me for no reason.\
  \ And then I found it\u2013 a half marathon in Zion National Park. Plus, it just\
  \ so happened to fall on my 23rd birthday. I hadn\u2019t planned on even finding\
  \ a reason to go, but there it was.\n\nThe trip was exactly what I needed. Zion\
  \ was indescribable. It was indefinite, wild, unforgiving, and beautiful beyond\
  \ words. It was like Mars to me. Red rock, desperate dryness and heat, steep cliffs,\
  \ and then there was that freshness that I had so franticly desired. Driving through\
  \ Zion for the first time was like an awakening. \n\nI had only been to one national\
  \ park before Zion, and the two are vastly different. Voyageurs National Park in\
  \ the \u201Cland of 10,000 lakes\u201D was the yin to the yang of Zion. If Voyageurs\
  \ was wooded hills, lakeshores filled with resorts, and old men in Stormy Kromer\
  \ hats asking about the day\u2019s catches, Zion was desert air, towering walls\
  \ of rock, and hipster hikers burdened with Osprey day packs. Living in the Midwest,\
  \ you get comfortable in those tall pines and lavish lake communities. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find comfort in those rising hills, but it was there. \n\nWhen I was\
  \ planning, I didn\u2019t think much about how this trip would affect me. I knew\
  \ the altitude was different, I knew I had never been west of the Dakotas, and I\
  \ knew I would run my first half marathon. I didn\u2019t know I would run into an\
  \ old work friend while walking the streets of the Las Vegas Strip for the first\
  \ time, holding a yard-high daiquiri. I didn\u2019t realize replacing drunken birthday\
  \ shenanigans with desert ATV rides would be an utterly perfect way to spend my\
  \ 23rd birthday. And, I didn\u2019t know I could find just as much beauty here in\
  \ the good ol\u2019 USA as I could had I traveled 4,000 miles away to foreign lands.\n\
  \nOn the third day of the trip, we had an ambitious plan. I would race my half marathon\
  \ at 7am, and then we would hike Angel\u2019s Landing, one of the most strenuous\
  \ hikes in Zion. Changing plans wasn\u2019t like me; I was set on hiking, until\
  \ we got out of the car after driving back to our cowboy cabin. My hamstrings and\
  \ arches were screaming. So, I quieted the voice in my head that was telling me\
  \ to suck it up and hike, and went to make alternative plans.\nThe alternative plan\
  \ ended up being that sunset ATV drive in the hills above Zion. And like that trip\
  \ to Zion in the first place, it was the unexpected change of plans that ended up\
  \ being just what I needed. In all the chaos, I found the beauty that lay even on\
  \ the edge, outside the park. It was another unplanned, unforeseen circumstance\
  \ that ended up being perfect. It was that moment I learned I could find peace in\
  \ even the most uneasy surroundings. \n\nThere\u2019s this feeling I get when I\
  \ get on any kind of ATV, snowmobile, or side-by-side. I feel invincible, like nothing\
  \ can bring me down. It\u2019s that feeling I hadn\u2019t expected to find in this\
  \ changing, wild, unplanned part of my life, especially on this trip. This trip\
  \ taught me that the journey is all we have, and that feeling invincible, finding\
  \ beauty in the unexpected, and taking a chance are all just byproducts of being\
  \ truly alive."
