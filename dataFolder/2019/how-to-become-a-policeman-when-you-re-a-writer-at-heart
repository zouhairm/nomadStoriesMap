Text: "When you are about to fly to the U.S. and you seek help around to prepare for\
  \ the language shock, everyone tells you not to worry, that British English and\
  \ American English are just the same, apart from stuff like the pants that stop\
  \ being underwear and turn into trousers.\n\nIt\u2019s not really a matter of the\
  \ litter being called trash, or the primary school being named elementary school,\
  \ it is also that, for example, if someone falls on you in the underground subway,\
  \ they\u2019ll say excuse me, and not sorry.  You wonder whether they needed road\
  \ directions or anything, but no, they only meant sorry.\n\nSo, if it was only the\
  \ gotten thing worrying you, then be prepared to get stuck in an array of shoulda\
  \ gotta catcha, to be immediately labelled as British if you come up with things\
  \ like cheers, bloody, rubbish or quid, and above all, be prepared to cope with\
  \ a range of accents that would make Scottish sound like classical music. I\u2019\
  ll never get why Americans call the toilet restroom, because you don\u2019t really\
  \ rest in a restroom, you don\u2019t take a nap there, do you?\n\nThat said, I must\
  \ admit that San Francisco is one of the most magical places I\u2019ve ever seen\
  \ in my life. You land there and you immediately feel like home for no reason. It\u2019\
  s like if anybody you randomly bump into has an incredible story to tell you. And\
  \ believe me, man, this is often the case.\n\nTake this policeman cop at the San\
  \ Francisco Police Department, for example. His name is Adam Plantinga and he wrote\
  \ a book called 400 Things Cops Know: Street-Smart Lessons from a Veteran Patrolman\
  \ that is damn good and makes you laugh out loud as you get to know about a million\
  \ things you ignored, ranging from how they exactly arrest a criminal to why and\
  \ how fights between teenage girls happen.\n\nI read this book cover to cover in\
  \ one evening, and then I started wondering whether this guy was a policeman or\
  \ a writer at heart, what his dream job as a child was, and so on. So I met him\
  \ at Moraga Commons Park on a Sunday morning as plenty of children marketed stuff\
  \ around for charity just like Lucy Van Pelt used to sell lemonade in the Peanuts\
  \ comics.\n\nSo you\u2019re a proper U.S.A. cop, Adam, aren\u2019t you?\n\nWell,\
  \ I\u2019m more actually a serjeant. But shouldn\u2019t you have a recorder to\u2026\
  \ record the interview?\n\nI\u2019m a kind of human note-taking app. So, what was\
  \ your dream job as a kid?\n\nI wanted to be a police officer when I was a kid,\
  \ or maybe an FBI agent, \u2019cause they seemed really cool. I also wanted to be\
  \ a cowboy, but then when I went to college, I got interested in different things.\
  \ My dad is a professor of theology, and he always told me to study what I loved,\
  \ so I majored in English. You\u2019re Italian, aren\u2019t you? Then I get what\
  \ you\u2019re thinking: you speak English, and you major in English, that\u2019\
  s dumb, isn\u2019t it?\n\nHow did you end up in the police then?\n\nI\u2019m from\
  \ Milwaukee, Wisconsin; I graduated there, then I moved to Texas, to work with homeless\
  \ teenagers, but the thing of being a cop never left me, so I got a second major\
  \ in Criminology, and I then joined the Milwaukee Police Department.\n\nWhat if\
  \ being a cop was not an option for you?\n\nI would have probably stayed in social\
  \ work, maybe working as a teacher. I am very community-oriented.\n\nYour book is\
  \ amazing. \n\nMy mum likes my book; my mum says I\u2019m the best \U0001F600\n\n\
  Was it hard to get published?\n\nI pitched my book to 90 publishers and got rejected\
  \ 90 times, then I tried to find an agent, and then I pitched it again, this time\
  \ to an independent publisher, and I finally got the deal.\n\nWill you send me the\
  \ book pdf, please,?\n\nI will forward this request to my publicist for two reasons.\
  \ First: I don\u2019t have the book on pdf. Second: it makes me sound like a bigshot\
  \ when I say I\u2019ve forwarded something to my publicist!"
