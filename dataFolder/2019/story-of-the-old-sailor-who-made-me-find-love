Text: "It was a wonderful, shining day in Dublin when my new friends and I decided\
  \ to take a dip into the rooted culture of the place. I had met them just the day\
  \ before, in a damp pub of Ballymoon, in the Northern side of the city, drinking\
  \ some artisanal beer and listening to a makeshift band plunking a popular motif\
  \ in an ancient language: Sean, James, Grace, Isabelle, and of course Siobhan. The\
  \ blazing color of her red hair, and the intense, fierce gaze of her hazel eyes\
  \ catched my attention at once: when she glanced at me for the first time, she immediately\
  \ lit into my heart the fire of passion. I didn't find the courage to talk to her,\
  \ therefore deciding to wait until the following day.  After the breakfast, composed\
  \ of two scrambled eggs, some bacon rashers and one black pudding, we opted for\
  \ going to Howth, the harbour in the Dublin Bay. While having our ride on the train,\
  \ I was very thoughtful: my mind was still stuck to the previous night, and my stream\
  \ of consciousness resembled a downward spiral twirling on itself, not being capable\
  \ of leaving those memories apart. As soon as we left the train, a gust of crisp\
  \ wind refreshed my brain, as it happens when you wake up from a torturous dream.\
  \ We walked until the pier, where it was possible to spot the seals crowding the\
  \ waters of the turbid sea. Looking far towards the horizon, an emerald island appeared\
  \ in front of my eyes. Then, an old sailor proded me on the shoulder: his long,\
  \  silver beard looked like the cotton candy of Grafton Street that we used to eat\
  \ sitting in the park near there. <<Dia Dhuit!>> - which means \"Hi!\u201C - said\
  \ the sailor greeting me with a naive smile that showed the few teeth that he had\
  \ in the mouth. The fact that he talked to me in Irish made me immediately willing\
  \ to establish a connection with him, a connection that had the taste of the land\
  \ that was hosting me in that period. Fortunately I had the opportunity in Cork\
  \ to study the ancient language of the Irish people, spending there the previous\
  \ months. The desire to know more about this old man pushed me to entertain a straightforward\
  \ conversation with him, and then he asked me if I wanted to visit the island in\
  \ the distance, that was called \"Ireland's Eye\", and from which it was possible\
  \ to admire the astonishing beauty of the entire city. The suggestion immediately\
  \ excited me and my friends, and after a while we sailed with the boat, to the discovery\
  \ of this new place. \n<<I didn't know you could speak Irish!>> said Siobhan, with\
  \ an expression of surprise: the light of the sun had made his face even brighter,\
  \ with the dimples highlighting her freckles. I didn't know what to answer, and\
  \ what I did was just to babble some frivolous words, when I realized that we were\
  \ about to dock. Jumping off from the vehicle, we started to climb towards the top\
  \ of the hill, and while doing this I saw that the sun was disappearing, leaving\
  \ the floor to a pallid mist, which was perfectly in line with the confusion that\
  \ I had in my head in that precise moment. Siobhan asked me if everything was fine,\
  \ and from that moment we started an intense discussion, which only got interrupted\
  \ when we noticed that we lost the others. The first thing that I did was calling\
  \ James, finding out that they had gone back to the harbor, and that the next ferry\
  \ would have passed from the island one our later: now there was only me and her,\
  \ among the green fields of Ireland's Eye. I picked a flower from the grass and\
  \ gave it to Siobhan, who kissed me on the cheek. That meeting with the old sailor\
  \ changed forever my life, and dissolving in the misty air with the girl that now\
  \ is the reason of my happiness and gives meaning to my days has been one of the\
  \ most sublime experiences that I have ever made."
