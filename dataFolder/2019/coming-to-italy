Text: "It all started with a facebook friend request from a very handsome young man\
  \ who was living in Italy at the time and I was living in kenya.  We had met in\
  \ person from one of his holiday in kenya. \n\nAfter exchanging text messages via\
  \ Facebook and phone we quickly fell in love with each other. \n\nSoon he returned\
  \ to the country and we met each other's family and friends and it was all beautiful.\
  \ He returned to Italy and he proposed to me . I agreed and the following year he\
  \ came back and we wedded. \n\nThat met I had to pack up my life and move to Italy\
  \ to live with him. It was a hard decision living my family and friend and my very\
  \ good paying job to go and start over in a new country.\n\nI moved a year later.\
  \ It was both exciting and scary.  I was met with a few challenges mainly not being\
  \ able to communicate with the locals as they only spoke Italian. \n\nThe country\
  \ it's self is beautiful I have travelled to the different parts and made so many\
  \ beautiful memories. The people are lovely . The food is simply awesome. And I\
  \ am getting Italian lessons. \n\nIn the long run the move was worth it."
