Text: "This trip was inspired by a pic I was of my friend on social media. She had\
  \ been to Himalaya for a trek and posted a few pics on it, I was intrigued by a\
  \ particular pic, where she was surrounded by thick snow, I was pretty sure it would\
  \ be freezing out there yet she looked peaceful and calm. There was a sense of achievement\
  \ in her face. This caught my attention, I called her and asked her about it, the\
  \ way she described her trip was exciting and adventurous, It inspired me  to visit\
  \ this place.\n\n\u200B I am a person who loves a challenge, I wanted to see if\
  \ I would be able to complete a week-long trek. So I researched on few webpages\
  \ and decided on Har ki doon. The place looked beautiful and pretty.But I had two\
  \ tasks on hand, one I had to convince my parents to let me travel alone and two\
  \ I had to undergo training before the trek.\n\nI played it smart and was able to\
  \ resolve my first issue, I convinced my dad to let me travel and he in turn Convinced\
  \ my mom, she agreed on a condition that I had to take my cousin along, I was ok\
  \ with that. But the real task was training, I am late raiser and also I hated jogging,\
  \ but it was mandatory to be able to jog for 30 minutes before the trek commenced.\
  \ I took this as a challenge and pushed myself, the best part of training was I\
  \ lost weight - who doesn't want to lose weight. After a great struggle and push\
  \ from my mother, I was able to achieve the required training. This is the first\
  \ part of my journey , now comes the actual trek.\n\nWhen I reached the base camp,\
  \ I was thrilled. I didn't expect the drive from the airport to base camp would\
  \ be so beautiful, we drived through the mountains of Himachal Pradesh. Roads were\
  \ pretty narrow and though everyone was scared but me. I was excited, I was like\
  \ a kid on a roller coaster ride. After the formalities and instructions on do and\
  \ don\u2019ts of trekking. I should really appreciate the Indian hikes trek group\
  \ for the respect they have towards the local and also for their love for nature,\
  \ at the beginning of the trek they gave us a green bag, which is basically to collect\
  \ any plastic wrappers that we find on the trek, an initiative to keep the trails\
  \ clean and preserve the beauty of the trails. \n\nMy first day was really tough,\
  \ I need to take a break frequently. But my tours guides were patient enough to\
  \ let me walk at my own speed. They were four trek guides with us, three of them\
  \ were locals. And in the end, is a sweeper. His main duty is to see there is nobody\
  \ left behind. As I was the last person, usually I had more time to spend. We chatted\
  \ for the entire trek, he told me about their lifestyles, customs and beliefs. I\
  \ was so happy to see how much they loved these trails and how well they were able\
  \ to live in such extreme climatic conditions. \n\nBelieve me or not that guy was\
  \ wealthier than me, he owned apple orchids and sheep whose wool was exported. But\
  \ that is not why I can't forget him, he led a simple life and expected nothing\
  \ but respect for their place and lifestyle.  \n\nI didn't expect my trip to go\
  \ so happy and peaceful. Yes I did fall sick for half a day and yes it was challenging\
  \ but the experience I gained, people I met trumps all problems. I made friends\
  \ and saw how kind and helpful people were. When i refused to eat as it was freezing\
  \ and i didnt wanted to leave my tent, my co- trekkers were so kind enough to get\
  \ food for me to my tent and when i sick they fed me. I learnt a lot on this trip\
  \ from pitching a tent to humanity. And yes I was able to experience the very sense\
  \ of achievement I saw in my friend's pic."
