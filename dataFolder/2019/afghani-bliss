Text: "\u201CDeath.\u201D She closed her eyes and smiled at the sun. \n\u201CI asked\
  \ what brings you here to Dharamkot?\u201D I wanted to double-check if I heard what\
  \ I really heard. She shook her head and gave out a chuckle. The rays of the setting\
  \ sun basked the mountains in orange, the birds were drifting back to their nests\
  \ just like the tourists descended back to their hostels. And there she was sitting\
  \ as if she did not belong to the world of times, wars, crimes and agony. I had\
  \ met her three minutes ago and I knew I had to stay more. We watched the sun go\
  \ down and all I could hear was us breathing. \n\u201CWhat\u2019s your age?\u201D\
  \ She spoke in an Afghani accent and offered me a cigarette, was I going to say\
  \ no to that? No.\n\u201CI am 20 and you?\u201D She was a white skinned middle-aged\
  \ brunette with her head covered with Hijab. \n\u201CI am almost twice your age.\
  \ I remember when I was 20, lovely times.. lovely times.\u201D She smoked out of\
  \ her nose. The dark was soon upon us and my feet started freezing. We gradually\
  \ came down and found a restaurant with the fading zigzag graffiti on the wall painted\
  \ in patchy jade green that said \u2018Shakti caf\xE9\u2019. The main door to the\
  \ caf\xE9 opened in the slanting concrete streets and at one end it had the kitchen\
  \ that smelled of spilled oil and spices on the platform while at the rear end was\
  \ the door to the caf\xE9 owner\u2019s home\u2019s front Porch. She ordered two\
  \ cups of chai which at that point of time seemed like everything that was good\
  \ and pure in the world. \n\u201CYou\u2019re traveling all by yourself, what gives?\u201D\
  \ I wanted to tell her why I was there, once I could figure out myself.  Was it\
  \ the fact that I was trying to deal with my break up or I got drunk last summer\
  \ and lost my virginity to a total stranger inside a dirty washroom of a bar or\
  \ that I was harassed and molested by my close friend or the fact that I tried committing\
  \ suicide last week because I had no money for therapy.  \n\u201CI just wanted to\
  \ explore and see how it goes. You know, us youngsters, always brimming with adventure\
  \ and enthusiasm. It has been a total bummer so far!\u201D I tried to hide my thoughts\
  \ into a giggle and took the last sip of my tea.\n\u201CI used to be a prostitute\
  \ but a prostitute at least gets paid.\u201D She shook her head and gave out a sigh\
  \ along with a chortle. She was a lady of a few words but she said the most unexpected\
  \ things of all. \u201CI lost my son, my father and my husband, all of them together\
  \ in Kabul attack.\u201D I looked at her clueless and I am sure she did not expect\
  \ a reaction out of me anyway. \u201CI know, you\u2019re young and horrible things\
  \ might have happened to you but try and give life another chance. You live in a\
  \ free society where you can build your own world. Most girls in my country could\
  \ kill for a life like yours.\u201D I kept looking at her in a daze manner.\n\u201C\
  I have observed death too closely and trust me, you don\u2019t want to die.\u201D\
  \ She pointed at the rugged cut scar that ran vertically through my left wrist which\
  \ I hurriedly tried to hide pulling my sleeve down. \u201CEach of them would come\
  \ to my room every night for two months straight and rape me until I was too numb\
  \ to respond. Although I might have lived, death seems too overrated now. Don\u2019\
  t just breathe silly, live.\u201D With that she stood up and threw two 20 Rupee\
  \ bills on the table and left the caf\xE9. I did not have the guts to go after her\
  \ or continue the conversation. I didn\u2019t ask her name and neither did she.\n\
  \nThe next morning, I took the bus back to New Delhi, called my dad and told him\
  \ how much I love him. Ever since that very day, I have been trying my best at living\
  \ not just breathing."
