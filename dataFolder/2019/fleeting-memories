Text: "As my Boeing 737 approached Kolkata, I was overcome with a torrent of emotions.\
  \ It had been four years since my parents had decided to leave the city to live\
  \ halfway across the country. My visit this time felt like a bittersweet stroll\
  \ down an old cobbled pathway.\nMy stomach had been victim to a churning nerve-racking\
  \ feeling every minute of my almost three hour journey from Mumbai. As the wheels\
  \ of my plane screeched on the runway, tears rolled down my cheeks uncontrollably,\
  \ yet a smile spread across my face. Thoughts of how much this city might have changed\
  \ in my absence kept arising in my head in relative intervals.\nAs I left the airport,\
  \ the earthy smell of the city\u2019s monsoon rains mingling with the sweet smell\
  \ of condensed milk and jaggery, that was so representative of this city, quickly\
  \ caught up with me. Kolkata looked beautiful as ever but it did not feel much like\
  \ home anymore \u2013 with each block I drove past there seemed to have been an\
  \ addition to the already booming infrastructure.\nA lot seemed to have changed,\
  \ yet certain things remained as they were \u2013 Uber taxis were spread across\
  \ the streets yet the age old yellow Ambassador taxis continued to be a preferred\
  \ mode of transport for most, the over ground metro lines construction seemed to\
  \ be in full swing, yet the trams that have been running in Kolkata since 1873 were\
  \ still an enjoyable way to commute!\nWith each street light I crossed, reality\
  \ seemed to slowly catch up with me. It seemed as though even the most minuscule\
  \ of shops I once stood at had been wiped off and replaced with an extravagant political\
  \ banner or a distasteful office facade.\nI felt like a bit of an outcast among\
  \ the people with my less than proficient Bengali and my inability to push through\
  \ crowds. Although, I was glad to find that the few remaining sweet shops I came\
  \ across still sold delicacies that tasted absolutely heavenly. Each succulent rosogolla\
  \ reminded me of the times I ate over five of them as an entire meal, every spicy\
  \ puchka that I devoured made me reminisce the times I ended up in a bog soon after\
  \ eating them, and every bite of rasmalai reminded me of my mother feeding me the\
  \ same with her hands. \nThe day drew to a harrowing end and I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find myself pondering over how infrastructure had seemed to overpower the rustic\
  \ chaos that Kolkata is known to be. I had very theatrical expectations from my\
  \ visit \u2013 stopping at places I had been to as a child, reminiscing forgotten\
  \ emotions, but on the contrary, my expectations seemed to have been bulldozed by\
  \ the same machines that had left their mark where my childhood landmarks once stood.\n\
  While I sat on freshly watered grass on an open ground opposite the famous Victoria\
  \ Memorial I waited for it to light up as it did every evening \u2013 one major\
  \ characteristic of the city that had not changed.\nThe city seemed to be succumbing\
  \ to modernization and there was so much I wanted to do, part of me still wishing\
  \ my parents had not left so hastily in the first place. Sometimes it is your parents\
  \ who create your wounds, but you have to heal them.\nI remembered a time when life\
  \ was simpler. In that moment I felt like a romantic old soul among realists \u2013\
  \ hoping when all hope is lost, loving when love is gone, and radiating warmth,\
  \ and sincerity while others only seek power.\nMaybe one day I might just come back\
  \ to the home I was looking for and once again feel a sense of belonging.\n\n\n\

  \ dumpling made of Indian cottage cheese which Kolkata is famous for 4. Puchka \u2013\
  \ a hollow crunchy shell usually stuffed with a spicy potato mix and filled with\
  \ sour tamarind water, is sold on the streets of Kolkata 5. Rasmalai consists of\
  \ ball-shaped dumplings cooked in a sugar syrup and milk, with saffron"
