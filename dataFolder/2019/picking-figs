Text: "\u201CCome to my farm,\u201D he says and I quickly agreed to the outing. While\
  \ he was proud of his sleek, air conditioned office, it couldn\u2019t contain his\
  \ kinetic energy. Besides, he was disarmingly handsome in a quintessential Greek\
  \ manner. We\u2019d been conversing since I first fell in love with the small Mediterranean\
  \ town a year earlier, when he had invited me to a last minute dinner. Another offer\
  \ I couldn\u2019t decline, occurring the night before my departure.\n\nSeaside Greece\
  \ in August is hot and upon leaving his office air conditioning, sweat was soon\
  \ dripping down the small of my back. I was still in my swimsuit, a short sundress\
  \ hastily thrown on before coffee and our last minute meeting. My hair was damp\
  \ and salty from the sea. The sun reflecting off of the aquamarine bay was like\
  \ a distress call, a beckoning siren waiting to capture an unsuspecting sailor or\
  \ a lighthouse warning to stay away.\n\nI agreed to the excursion without any indication\
  \ of where we were going, soon learning his farm lay just outside of town. Upon\
  \ arrival at an unremarkable, battered, chain-link gate, he jumped out, unlocked\
  \ the padlock, and transported us into the countryside, the Greece of thousands\
  \ of years before. I was eager to experience this agrarian and wild version of Greece\
  \ and was out of the car before the engine was turned off. Dion cautioned me to\
  \ be on the lookout for snakes before I could get too far out of his sight, being\
  \ ever observant of my sandals and dress. I slowed and waited for him to catch up.\n\
  \nThe olive trees looked even more reverential up close, their ancient gnarled limbs\
  \ reaching towards the heavens, yet curling inward as if holding onto some magical\
  \ secret; the olive wood smooth, the sun and blue sky dappled by the tangle of branches.\
  \  He painstakingly pointed out the oil olives and the wild olives, explaining the\
  \ differences. Discussion of the pest disrupting the crop ensued and he deconstructed\
  \ and demonstrated his solution to spraying the olives, in keeping with his goals\
  \ of organic crops. The long, dry grass crackled under our feet as we walked, the\
  \ dirt hard packed and parched. I kept a keen eye out for a fluid movement indicating\
  \ the presence of a reptilian third party, while attentively absorbing the horticulture\
  \ lesson.\n\nAs we walked, he pointed out the small orange trees, where trails might\
  \ exist, and the property lines. All of this detailed, and somewhat complicated,\
  \ dialogue was conducted in his heavily accented English and my nonexistent Greek,\
  \ with each of us keenly observing the other\u2019s body language, reaching deep\
  \ into our respective knowledge of communication to complete the conversation. \n\
  \nAfter inquiring if I liked figs, he showed me his trees hiding near the back,\
  \ surrounded by tall grass. I received another snake warning before he climbed through\
  \ a tangle of brambles, an \u201Cela\u201D escaping as he caught his leg on one\
  \ of the thorns, drawing a bit of blood. He collected the ripe fruits from the tree\
  \ and bequeathed them to me as a short lived memento of our adventure. \n\nThe sticky\
  \ juice dripped down my hands, and his as well, so we paused at the old house to\
  \ wash under the hose. He bounded to the top the old foundation, pointing out the\
  \ unimpeded views of Navarino Bay and described his dreams for the house he was\
  \ going to build on the site. He was proud of this place, his investment in his\
  \ community, and his dreams for what was yet to come. His shyness evaporated under\
  \ the hot Grecian sun.\n\nWe could have spent the rest of the day exploring his\
  \ favorite places, those only known to locals. But it was the day I was to leave\
  \ and we were down to minutes, rather than hours. \n\nBegrudgingly, I asked him\
  \ to take me home, saying goodby quickly and efficiently, fighting every desire\
  \ to skip out on my return flight and live unhindered in the country. Obligation\
  \ superseded desire and I turned, the figs still sticky in my hands, trading part\
  \ of my soul for the fruit I now carried."
