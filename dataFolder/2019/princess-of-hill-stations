Text: "Kodaikanal, Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nMesmerized. That's the only word that I can\
  \ describe my state right now as I stand, 2000 meters above sea level, on the Coaker's\
  \ walk facing the never ending expanse of soft clouds and barely there rising peaks\
  \ of faraway mountains. How can I be so sure that it's the view that stole my breath\
  \ away and not the lack of oxygen?\nWell the explanation is very simple - Usually\
  \ I wouldn't miss any opportunity to click pictures of whatever intrigues me, be\
  \ it a selfie or plain old photography with the back camera. It irritates some while\
  \ the others love the beautiful pictures. But the moment I came into view of this\
  \ beautiful landscape, all I could do was look. Not even once my hand reached for\
  \ my phone. My eyes drank into the beauty that my mind could only describe as heaven.\n\
  Remember those childhood fairy tale shows and movies depicting fantasy lands? Well\
  \ alas! This is what it looked like, a sea of clouds extending from the place you\
  \ stand up to the infinites of the sky. The few mountain tops, high enough to peak\
  \ out seem like enchanted faraway worlds.\nWhen after a few minutes my mind walked\
  \ out of this daze, I reached out for my phone to encapsulate this wonder forever\
  \ but whatever pictures I clicked was deleted immediately. Nothing could match up\
  \ to the actual effect it had. & that's how I knew the place had me spell bound.\n\
  \nThe next destination was the Kodai Lake. I was visiting the place for the very\
  \ first time & yet it felt like deja-vu experience. Mind you it was no case of reincarnation\
  \ or amnesia. Few minutes later I realized the reason as well. The place looked\
  \ pretty oddly familiar to the backdrop of images of various TV shows shot at Central\
  \ Park, New York. Yes the glistening lake in the sunshine with the trees in colors\
  \ was f green, orange and some brown could easily be mistaken for a landmark in\
  \ The USA.\n\nLet\u2019s dig a little deeper down the memory lane to the teenage\
  \ years and the Vampire love story Twilight. Wanted to feel like Bella Swan arriving\
  \ for the first time at Forks?\nThe ride through the Palani Ghats with the winding\
  \ roads, mist and the Eucalyptus trees leave no effort to truly transport you to\
  \ her first time in Forks.\n\nI had come here to have a relaxing time but didn\u2019\
  t expect to fine such beauty, tranquility and nostalgia. The place is truly a \u2018\
  Princess of hill stations\u2019."
