Text: "Since I was a kid, I always had one dream inside of me: travel around the world.\
  \ My parents didn\u2019t have money to pay a trip on past. But I never lost hope.\
  \ I did a tattoo to never let me forget and give up this dream. And than, last year\
  \ (2018), I won a trip from the parents of my boyfriend. We went to USA, first to\
  \ Miami and after to Orlando, Disney. Since the airport, I was so excited! The last\
  \ time I was in a airport was almost 9 years ago. So I was jumping of happiness.\
  \ We took 2 flights to go there and everything was magic. Was the first time I drunk\
  \ Starbucks and I was so happy! After, I saw a lot of things and so many types of\
  \ people, food and languages there. Everything was so special, I wanted lost my\
  \ passport because than I could stay there more time. First, in Miami, I saw the\
  \ beach, I saw so many tourists and Americans. All the time I was learning something.\
  \ After 4 days we went to Orlando, and the first day on Disney, I thought my heart\
  \ would stop. I thought about my childhood and I felt in my heart, so much happiness.\
  \ Living all those things, all those experiences, tastes and smells. Life is more\
  \ than we can see. And our memories, our past... they make who we are. They show\
  \ us the meaning of a real life and they give us the chance to do different in future.\
  \ It was my first experience in another country. But will not be the last. I will\
  \ never give up. I will fight for what I want. Live for more. And than you will\
  \ know why the answer \u201Cwhy am I living\u201D was always inside of you. And\
  \ outside, in world."
