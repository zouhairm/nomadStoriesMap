Text: "\"You are late\"\nThe voice of the old lady, who was hosting me, came from\
  \ the second floor, sharply crossing the darkness. I did not think I did anything\
  \ wrong; after all, I had lost the penultimate bus, and I had to take the next one.\
  \ It's not such an unusual thing, if you're seventeen and it's your second night\
  \ in an unknown city. In that case, York. I had arrived the day before to take language\
  \ courses, and already the ancient charm of the place had bewitched me. Everything\
  \ was so wonderfully out of the ordinary, for me used to the frenzy of Rome: the\
  \ lopsided architecture of the Shambles, the austere, snappy magniloquence of the\
  \ cathedral's gothic steeples, and the people: that roughness that may appear unfriendly\
  \ at a first glance, typical of those who are accustomed to an inclement weather.\
  \ And in those weeks, it had been particularly: the rain was falling, torrential,\
  \ throughout Yorkshire, giving a nineteenth-century novel atmosphere to a city with\
  \ an endless number of ghosts and stories to tell. There was no doubt about why\
  \ those areas had inspired Conan Doyle and Bram Stoker. The dimmed lights of the\
  \ alleys, drenched in the rain, and the silence, sometimes broken by a vernacular\
  \ phrase in the rough northern accent of some drunk coming out of a pub, renewed\
  \ the feeling of a place not willing to bow to the barbaric approach of the future.\
  \ That evening, the whole city was animated by an ancient pride, in an inevitable\
  \ contrast with the pale and anonymous cultural homologation that the world is currently\
  \ witnessing.\nNo, I did not feel guilty at all. But while I was listening to the\
  \ bored and vaguely angry voice of the old lady, the fear of not being able to complete\
  \ that transfer in the past necessary to communicate corroded me from the inside.\
  \ I looked around, hesitant, without even having the courage to reply. In the meanwhile,\
  \ my eyes had grown accustomed to the darkness, and I could clearly distinguish\
  \ the shapes of the furniture in the ground floor. In the living room, with its\
  \ low ceiling, typical of the British terraced houses, stood the black silhouette\
  \ of the pendulum clock. The silence was so penetrating that I could clearly hear\
  \ its ticking. Seconds passed, and seemed like an eternity: the anxiety of not being\
  \ able to communicate was becoming unbearable. I swallowed, ventured a subdued \"\
  sorry\", to which the faceless voice replied with an abrupt \"Goodnight\". Then\
  \ again silence. I went upstairs and took shelter into my room at the first floor,\
  \ where my host\u2019s black cat peered at me from the bed, as if the voice had\
  \ been hers. I glanced at the wooden slate on the wall next to the nightstand, where\
  \ an article from a local newspaper stood out. With a humorous British-like twist\
  \ of fate, It was about a person who had gone crazy for seeing a hooded black figure\
  \ in a Yorkshire town cemetery. The paradoxical irony of that situation shook me\
  \ from the trance state, and brought me back to reality. I ventured a nervous laugh,\
  \ then I came back serious and thought about how complicated it was to make people\
  \ from different generations talk to each other.  I promised myself to be more careful,\
  \ in the days ahead, which would actually happen. Day by day, I built a more intense\
  \ bond with my host, and it seemed like a bridge between past and present. Days\
  \ after, once back home, I thought of that first surreal impact with a world different\
  \ from mine, out of my time and my space. Then a detail, to which I had not given\
  \ so much weight before, came back to my mind and made me smile. In those seconds\
  \ of silence, in which I tried to sketch an excuse, the pendulum had beaten eleven\
  \ strokes, striking them in a powerful and threatening way. The conversation ended\
  \ just on the eleventh, again in an ironic coincidence between reality and literature.\
  \ The voice of my guest had vanished in assonance with the echo of the last, striking\
  \ toll. Just like in a ghost story."
