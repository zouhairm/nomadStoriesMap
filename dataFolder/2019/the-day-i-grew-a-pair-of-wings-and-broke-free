Text: "As a young Egyptian woman trying to break free and discover the world traveling\
  \ was not an easy endeavor as you need a significant amount of cash just to apply\
  \ for a visa to go anywhere in the world, adding to that the culture of how women\
  \ shouldn't travel alone or leave their parent's house until they're married. So,\
  \ imagine my dilemma!\n\nI had a knack for traveling ever since I was 10. I spent\
  \ my first 7 years of my life in Saudi Arabia where I started learning English through\
  \ the international community I was in. Shortly after, I moved to Cairo, Egypt.\
  \ Land of the pharaohs and the 5000 year old history which remains a mystery until\
  \ this day. As the years passed, my itch for traveling began to nag me... I couldn't\
  \ bear it! So, in my sophomore year in university I decided to apply for a job as\
  \ an au pair and travel to Germany. Now, I didn't know how to open this subject\
  \ with my dad who made a big deal out of me just sleeping over at a friend's house\
  \ over the weekend... How was I supposed to tell him that I wanted to go to Germany\
  \ for a year and work? Take a year off of college? I must\u2019ve been insane! As\
  \ you can imagine, he freaked out, completely lost it, but to cut it short he finally\
  \ agreed to let me go on the condition that I will only spend a few months there\
  \ and not the whole year. It was a good compromise. My year there was nothing short\
  \ of ordinary, it was a dream come true! Mind the clich\xE9. I was 19, and for the\
  \ first time of my life, traveling alone in unknown territory. I didn\u2019t even\
  \ speak the language! I immersed myself in the experience as a whole; I worked,\
  \ taught English and Arabic, learned a bit of German, traveled around Germany, and\
  \ met people from all around the world. It was an eye opener to what lay beyond\
  \ the borders of Egypt.\n\nAfter coming back, I couldn\u2019t sit still, I knew\
  \ I caught the travel bug! I was eager to travel again as soon as possible, but\
  \ unfortunately due to the \u201CRise of the Arab Spring\u201D revolution which\
  \ took place in 2011 in Egypt it was quite impossible. Finding an opportunity to\
  \ travel was little to none, so I grew a tiny bit hopeless and decided to bury myself\
  \ into work. To my surprise, after my first year of being a middle school teacher\
  \ the school principal asked whether I was interested in going to Denmark for 2\
  \ weeks as part of a professional development called the DAPP Danish Arab Partnership\
  \ Program from teachers. I didn\u2019t think twice and accepted the offer of course\
  \ and it was one the most wonderful experiences ever. Not only did I get to visit\
  \ the country and enjoy a lot of different activities but I was also able to visit\
  \ schools and attend multiple workshops which made me into the teacher I am today.\
  \ \n\nDuring my second year of teaching, there was a school trip to Barcelona, Spain.\
  \ The school usually selects senior teachers to go on those trips with students\
  \ as chaperones, but to my astonishment, and notice how all my travels were perfectly\
  \ unplanned, I was asked whether I would be able to accompany the students on that\
  \ trip instead because the teacher wasn\u2019t able to make it. I tried to play\
  \ it cool and accept her offer professionally as much as I could, but as soon as\
  \ I left her office I was literally jumping up and down with joy. Most of my travel\
  \ experiences were sort of a magical moment that just came out of nowhere including\
  \ my latest adventure here in Tokyo, where I am currently working. This was probably\
  \ the most unbelievable one of them all because I basically decided to quit my job,\
  \ pack my bags and leave everything behind and accept the most unrealistic job offer\
  \ ever, but it\u2019s been nothing but a bliss and I would do it all over again\
  \ if I had the chance to."
