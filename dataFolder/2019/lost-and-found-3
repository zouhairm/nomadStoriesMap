Text: "I didn't expect to find myself while traveling.  Living in a city that is full\
  \ of distractions and diversions on an hourly basis it is easy to lose track of\
  \ what is important.  There was a weight on my mind, a feeling like I am running\
  \ fast but getting nowhere.  My mind was cluttered with desires of money, success,\
  \ career and my future.  Questioning my purpose in life, it was time for a change\
  \ from the urban jungle to the Amazon jungle.  \n    Like a time traveler, I took\
  \ a flight and woke up in a new landscape.  I spent Christmas in Tarapoto, Peru\
  \ to get ready for the tropical heat and humidity that would be the norm.  The streets\
  \ were filled with music and people of all ages  dancing and singing.  Local tribes\
  \ and artists showcased their talents.  Festive decorations adorned motor taxis\
  \ as Santa would drive families around the block.  Fireworks exploded all around\
  \ us.  It was pure magic to watch how the people of the Amazon celebrate life and\
  \ this made me feel happy to be alive. \n    I jumped onto a rusty old cargo ship.\
  \  It was a hammock hostel on water crammed with locals going about their business.\
  \  There was no sense of personal space.  It was time to open the door of my soul\
  \ and to experience something new.  With a smile and almost no Spanish I began the\
  \ conversation with my neighbors.  The following day I arrived in a small village\
  \ called Lagunas. With few places to eat and sleep and no electricity at night I\
  \ would meet many friendly faces as curious as I was.  From here I began a journey\
  \ down the meandering rivers of the Picaya-Samiria Reserve.  With supplies, a couple\
  \ paddles in a dug out canoe and a guide that did not speak English we embarked\
  \ on our journey together.   The jungle is such a peaceful and rewarding experience.\
  \  Surrounded by lush vegetation, I would hear the calls of birds, pink dolphins\
  \ catching some air, river otters squawking with their cat like faces, monkeys swinging\
  \ from tree to tree and then fishing for piranhas to eat at dinner.  I felt like\
  \ I was having a 3D IMAX experience.  The evening stars filled the skies as the\
  \ creatures of the night would conjure up wild thoughts of snakes or an elusive\
  \ Jaguar ready to attack me as I sleep?  There was no cars, no cell phones, no internet.\
  \  I could actually hear myself think.  I could dream as big as this wonderful place\
  \ known as the Amazon. \n    Who am I.  What is the meaning of life.  Why am I here.\
  \  Maybe getting lost is the best way to discover yourself.  It certainly is a good\
  \ way to discover a city.  Filled with curiosity and a deeper awareness, I felt\
  \ that life was less about myself and more about the world around me.  Travel was\
  \ giving me an unfiltered education that I did not learn in a school or at home.\
  \  In the heart of the jungle, I would visit many villages and people who live off\
  \ the land.  Life seems so simple\u2026hunting, fishing and harvesting fruits or\
  \ plants for food and medicine.  I realize we are similar in so many ways.  We want\
  \ to have a purpose, to be happy and be with other people.  Working hard, playing\
  \ together and living in communities helps us to live and grow while we protect\
  \ our cultural differences for future generations.  Can life be this simple in a\
  \ city?  By connecting with other people I have learned about how my past life,\
  \ growing up with challenges and problems, has influenced how I deal with my life\
  \ today. We all have similar wants and needs.  I enjoy variety.  I need challenges.\
  \  I want to share my story.  I understand the value of the people we meet and the\
  \ experiences we carry in our lives.  I began my trip to get away but what I discovered\
  \ was much more\u2026life really is what you make it."
