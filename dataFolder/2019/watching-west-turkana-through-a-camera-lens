Text: "After a long, hot day of visiting fossil sites in the Turkana Basin, our field\
  \ school group wasn't drained, but energized. The excitement produced by crawling\
  \ on Pliocene sands, dirt caking under our fingernails while we collected the fossils\
  \ of ancient animals kept us keyed up all afternoon. Instead of the usual swim in\
  \ the Turkwel or impromptu stickball game, our instructor suggested we join the\
  \ local Turkana people in a game of soccer, or football as it is known in Kenya\
  \ and the rest of the world.\n\nI was never an athlete. I enjoy sports -- the running\
  \ around parts, the getting sweaty parts -- but I am not competitive and rarely\
  \ an asset on anyone's team. To avoid disappointing my classmates, I offered to\
  \ take photos using the gorgeous Canon camera that our teaching assistant kept around\
  \ his neck. He handed the camera to me with some basic instructions and ran to the\
  \ center of the makeshift field we marked off with lines drawn in the earth. I snapped\
  \ photos of precise kicks, action shots of my friends running and blocking passes,\
  \ and cheerful moments when someone shot a goal. \n\nIn less exciting moments, like\
  \ when someone went to retrieve a stray ball, I fixed my attention to the world\
  \ outside the football field. A child rolling a bicycle tire with a stick, a woman\
  \ resting her palm against the thatched roof of her boma, goats wandering on a nearby\
  \ ridge. An acacia tree silhouetted by the sunset, a small girl watching her brother\
  \ balance a ball on the tip of his shoe. That evening, I not only took some of the\
  \ most beautiful photos I have ever taken but I learned that, sometimes, being on\
  \ the sidelines doesn't mean you're missing out."
