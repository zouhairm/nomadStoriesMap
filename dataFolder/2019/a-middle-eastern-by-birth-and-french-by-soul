Text: "A middle eastern by birth and French by soul\n\nOnce upon a time, many people\
  \ were telling me that I look French and maybe some of my genes are French, I said\
  \ to myself \u201COkay, I should go there and see if I\u2019ll feel home or not,\
  \ Paris is my next destination\u201D.\nI packed my bag, booked a flight to Paris\
  \ and after 6 hours, I landed off on the city of love.\n \nI spent 7 days in Paris;\
  \ my ultimate pleasure was getting lost in those fancy dramatic French streets.\
  \ At my first day, I went out for hours and hours of walking to recognize the French\
  \ faces, know their features, smell their fresh bread and see lovers kissing in\
  \ the streets.\nThe first couple of days I had no plans for sightseeing as much\
  \ as just walking around the small streets which are curved by history and bakery\
  \ shops. To be honest, trying the French breakfast was a heck of an epic experience,\
  \ smelling the French crispy bread crushing smoothly in my mouth with their French\
  \ cheese was a tempting experience.\n\nOne of the perks of getting lost in strange\
  \ streets that there\u2019re always unexpected surprises haunting your heart; like\
  \ those small neighborhoods with narrow alleyways full of history and ancient smell\
  \ and if you looked up, you will be fascinated by the small balconies that are goodly\
  \ decorated by baskets of colored flowers. Those are the kind of walks that you\
  \ can see things as French as they\u2019re.\nI started my day with a cup of French\
  \ coffee at Le Petite Pont caf\xE9 then headed to Paris Opera house; as a ballerina,\
  \ being in such a place is always overwhelming; the architecture was pure sophisticated\
  \ art full of passion and beauty.\n\nThen I headed to Sainte Chapelle which is a\
  \ royal chapel in the French Gothic architecture, this was the first time to see\
  \ such an architecture, you won\u2019t be able to look down or even blink because\
  \ the amount of beauty and art on the walls and roofs are just amazing.\nI took\
  \ the rest of myself trying to handle such a huge amount of art in my soul and headed\
  \ to Notre Dame cathedral, a medieval Catholic cathedral so it had a totally different\
  \ architecture style which is not any less beauty and artistic than any cathedral\
  \ I could see in my life. \n\nThe next morning was museums day and everything around\
  \ it; starting with the world\u2019s largest art museum in Paris, Louvre museum.\
  \ \nNumerous pieces of paintings from all over the world are collected in one place;\
  \ each one had its historical story on a small table below the painting so you can\
  \ understand what you\u2019re seeing. You can feel the story behind it!\n\nNext\
  \ morning, I grabbed a French toast with cheese, their high quality jam and butter\
  \ and went for a walk in the streets until it was almost sunset and I was on my\
  \ way to The Basilica of the Sacred Heart, a Roman Catholic Church; it\u2019s an\
  \ ancient Roman architecture so I decided to watch the sunset from there.\nIt\u2019\
  s up on a hill; you use the stairs- lots of them- or the chairlifts so you\u2019\
  ll be able to see it, it\u2019s huge and surrounded by lands of green, then lots\
  \ of stairs to go down, many people were sitting on the stairs, eating, talking,\
  \ meditating, praying, singing or just sitting in silence as an appreciation to\
  \ the spirituality of the place. \nYou can see a city of stars shining and you own\
  \ it all\u2026\n\nStarting my next day with Champs-\xC9lys\xE9es and Charles de\
  \ Gaulle, it was autumn time and leaves were falling gently on the ground with dim\
  \ lights all over the street adding a sense of magic all over my soul.\n\nLast day\
  \ was for a quite French dinner with a piano in the middle of the restaurant playing\
  \ my favorite songs for Edith Piaf. \nBy the end of my trip, I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find France in me and i was the happiest there so as clich\xE9 as this sounds\
  \ \u201Ctake me to Paris and never look back; we can be crazy like that\u201D \u2013\
