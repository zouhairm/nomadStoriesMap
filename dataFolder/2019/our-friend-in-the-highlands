Text: "In 2008 my US Army Ret. husband and I set off on a belated honeymoon to introduce\
  \ me to the places he had loved for decades: Korea and Vietnam. I had never held\
  \ a burning desire to go to Vietnam until I met Dan, as I had no connection to it;\
  \ everyone I knew was either too old or too young to have served in Vietnam. Meeting\
  \ Dan, however, a man who had served 3.5 tours there in the US Army, as well as\
  \ having worked there after the war, moved Vietnam to the top of my 6-page \u201C\
  bucket list\u201D: I realized that in order to fully understand him, I had to experience\
  \ Vietnam. And so we embarked on our honeymoon: A week in Korea, followed by four\
  \ nights in Japan, (for me, as I had dreamed of Japan for decades), and 3.5 weeks\
  \ in Vietnam. I had quizzed Dan about the things he loved in both Korea and Vietnam,\
  \ did a great deal of research and emailing, and planned what turned out to be a\
  \ fabulous trip,  including Dr. Fish and pheasant hunting in Korea, and staying\
  \ at an historic Ryokan in Kyoto. His great love was for the Montagnard People of\
  \ the Vietnam Central Highlands, but, at that time, I could find no tourism information\
  \ about the area, and whenever I'd mention it in an email, I'd come to a dead end-\
  \ the emails would literally stop. We had finally decided to \u201Cwing it\u201D\
  \ once we arrived in Vietnam... when, shortly before our departure, I found an online\
  \ article mentioning an extraordinary man who spoke many of the 100s of  Highlands\
  \ dialects, as well as English... and I emailed him. We flew into Pleiku and took\
  \ a taxi to KonTum to meet him, and when he saw us his eyes went back and forth\
  \ from Dan to I as he figured out our story- I could practically see his mind working:\
  \ older, grizzled Vietnam Veteran with a wife 13 years younger- who was his age...\
  \ It was hard not to laugh! The three of us spent wonderful days in the Highlands,\
  \ visiting Montagnard villages and meeting fascinating people, drinking \u201Cjar\
  \ wine\u201D, eating delicious food, and taking a dugout canoe down the DakBla River,\
  \ looking up at the ridge-line Dan had walked many years before... and becoming\
  \ very good friends. For my 49th birthday he arranged a dinner party at a restaurant\
  \ hidden down an alleyway, and we arrived on motorbikes in the rain... at what would\
  \ turn out to be My Best Birthday Ever! To start, he presented me with 49 red roses\
  \ (which I carried through the rest of our holiday, like Miss KonTum 1959, LOL),\
  \ but the most amazing thing was when the dinner morphed into a Chinook Helicopter\
  \ Reunion, with a Vietnamese Veteran who had not only flown Chinooks, as Dan had,\
  \ but had studied at Ft. Rucker, in Alabama... We ate grilled meat and toasted with\
  \ Hanoi Vodka... and I had one of the most extraordinary evenings of my life! We\
  \ stayed in touch, emailing photos and Tet greetings, and in 2015 Dan and I were\
  \ able to return to Vietnam, and see our friend in the Highlands. This time he took\
  \ us on a 6km trek into the mountains- now much different from the tiger-filled\
  \ jungle Dan had experienced- the hardest hike of my life! I literally descended\
  \ that mountain on my butt, but for Dan, who was truly at home again, it was a cake-walk:\
  \ he danced up and down the mountain like a billy goat! We ate weasel jerky with\
  \ mountain villagers, and were guests at a wedding, and a KonTum nightclub, zipping\
  \ around on motorbikes... and having another marvelous time. We took cooking classes,\
  \ too, and when we returned to West Virginia I began planting Vietnamese herbs and\
  \ peppers in our garden, so Dan could cook the authentic Vietnamese cuisine we love\
  \ for our guests... That trip was Dan's 10th to Vietnam, and we dream of returning...\
  \ but Vietnam is now truly a part of our daily lives, even in the mountains of WV:\
  \ the greatest gift my husband has given me is his love for Vietnam and her people."
