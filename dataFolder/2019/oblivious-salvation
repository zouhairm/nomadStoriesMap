Text: "\u201CLook into the eyes of the deities once you are in the inner sanctum,\u201D\
  \ my grandmother used to tell me when I was a kid. She had never visited the Jagannath\
  \ Temple at Puri. However, she insisted I must go someday. Like Mecca for Muslims,\
  \ it is one of the holy Char Dham (Four Abodes) pilgrimage sites for Hindus to visit\
  \ at least once in their lifetime. It is believed that Lord Jagannath is the incarnation\
  \ of Vishnu, the creator of our universe according to Hindu mythology. \n\nI went\
  \ on a solo trip to Puri as a college student in the summer break. Since the annual\
  \ festival at the temple was a month away, I had expected less number of pilgrims\
  \ in the town. To the eastern India, on the shore of Bay of Bengal, unfurls the\
  \ flag of Jagannath temple. Unlike many who go there for religious purposes or spiritual\
  \ awakening, I was there just as a curious kid. The streets of Puri town has broadened\
  \ (called Bada Danda) owing to the growing number of visitors each year. Roadside\
  \ stalls are lined up with vendors selling coconuts, incense sticks, garland of\
  \ guava and other things that can be used in ritualistic ceremony. There is sandal\
  \ paste too which the priest smear on your forehead once you're inside the temple.\
  \ \n\nA poet in Odia literature wrote, \u201CI find solace in staring the eyes of\
  \ Lord Jagannath.\u201D This deems so irrelevant to the outsiders, yet people rush\
  \ to the sanctum to get a glimpse of the sculpture of Lord Jagannath, his brother\
  \ Balabhadra and sister, Subhadra while they are seated on a raised platform. The\
  \ three wooden sculptures have half built hands and no body parts below the abdomen.\
  \ I thought of my grandmother when I enter the temple. Though I'm not a very religious\
  \ person I could feel the aura when hundreds of devotees were bowing down in front\
  \ of the deities.\n\nThe temple was built in twelfth century. The culture and rituals\
  \ associated with it has been embedded in regional people's lives. I see activities\
  \ of Kirtan, singing devotional songs in various corners of the premises. There\
  \ are hundred of priests with unique dressing -white dhoti and saffron clothes to\
  \ wrap the torso. Their forehead is nicely smeared with sandalwood paste which is\
  \ considered holy. In certain corner I see a group of musical people playing dhol,\
  \ string instruments and drums. They are reciting religious songs. I'm surprised\
  \ to see white people among them. Upon asking, it is revealed that foreigners from\
  \ across the globe who seek spiritual and mental peace come here and embrace the\
  \ life of these people. \n\nThe prasad (offering of food to God which later can\
  \ be served to people) system is peculiar here. Everyday thousands of pilgrim show\
  \ up. They cook one time and interestingly the prasad doesn't come short. There\
  \ is rumours that no bird has flown over the temple. The architecture of the temple\
  \ is so brilliant that it doesn't produce shadow at any given point of time. Of\
  \ course, the typical Indian temple structure is exquisite and an piece of art.\
  \ \n\nMoving out of the temple premises, I walk towards the sea beach. The narrow\
  \ lanes on the way are full of traders, vendors and people. It's their everyday\
  \ life. It's chaotic but I see so much diversity - array of people from different\
  \ culture blending in because their supreme goal is not material possession but\
  \ spiritual awakening. \n\nThe shore of Bay of Bengal is crashing the shore with\
  \ raging waves. Legend has it, the Sadhaba Pua ( ancient tradesmen tribe) embark\
  \ upon their journey to Cambodia, Philippines and adjoining islands from here. They\
  \ used to go for trading commodities and spreading of Hindu culture long before\
  \ the British had found their way to India. I sit here on the sand, relaxing, and\
  \ watch over the blue water of the sea. Kids with their mothers are running around,\
  \ youngsters are jumping on to the crashing waves, vendors are calling out for customers\
  \ to buy fancy products. It will get dark soon."
