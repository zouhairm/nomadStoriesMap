Text: "I did my best to hold the binoculars still against my glasses as I squinted\
  \ to make out nine horses on the grassy slope. Two white foals nursed from their\
  \ mothers as a stallion patrolled the perimeter, occasionally returning to nuzzle\
  \ a mare before resuming his guard duties. As we watched, my classmates and I barely\
  \ drew breath for fear of scaring this rare and wild family away.\n\nWhen looking\
  \ for the right master's program three years prior, I had no idea my search would\
  \ lead me to studying wild Takhi horses in the middle of the Eurasian steppe, one\
  \ of the least densely populated landscapes on Earth. Yet here I was, crouching\
  \ in the freezing cold at 5:00 in the morning, dutifully marking their movements\
  \ every thirty seconds while the moon set and the sun rose on another windy Mongolian\
  \ day. \n\nNothing in my life so far has compared to observing the last wild horse\
  \ species in the world the day after having ridden a horse for the first time. \n\
  \nI had never really been a \u201Chorse person\u201D and hadn\u2019t expected to\
  \ feel much more than the excitement of doing something new when I hopped into the\
  \ saddle. So I was surprised to not only feel immediately comfortable on my horse,\
  \ but also very connected to him. As we trotted along with a group of his peers\
  \ and mine, I enjoyed the sensation of moving quickly through the landscape with\
  \ this unique form of locomotion and the difference in view a slight increase in\
  \ height offered. \n\nI had chosen my horse for his wild mop of hair and I dubbed\
  \ him \u201CGarth\u201D, after Dana Carvey\u2019s shaggy blonde character from Wayne\u2019\
  s World. It was a great mane for headbanging and I sang the melody of \u201CBohemian\
  \ Rhapsody\u201D as he bobbed his head up and down. My fellow riders named their\
  \ horses as well and as we rode, we chided our new animals friends for nudging each\
  \ other in the rear, convinced they were responding to the names we had given them.\n\
  \nAs we neared the end of our time on horseback, a few others who were familiar\
  \ with riding goaded their horses into a canter and Garth and I followed suit. Though\
  \ startling at first, the change in pace was thrilling and I leaned in and enjoyed\
  \ the smoothness of the canter as our bodies flew together through the air. \n\n\
  My time with Garth came to an end much sooner than I would have liked, but it was\
  \ time to head back to our village for the evening\u2019s entertainment: a throat-singing\
  \ performance by a local group that none of us would ever forget.  When I dismounted\
  \ with shaky legs and sore knees, I was already thinking about the next time I would\
  \ be able to ride, wishing it had lasted twice as long. \n\nAnd now here I was a\
  \ day later, watching a group of wild Takhi with a newfound appreciation for horses\
  \ and their place in our world. Although I had taken great pleasure in my brief\
  \ horse riding experience, I was pleased to find that here on this hillside was\
  \ an equine species that had never been tamed or ridden by humans, which these days\
  \ is a rare and beautiful thing."
