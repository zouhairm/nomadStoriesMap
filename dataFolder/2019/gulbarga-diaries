Text: "The temperatures of the exam were hot, the sound of stable sleep and the whole\
  \ thing was frozen. When the change seemed unrealistic, the journey was ready for\
  \ travel. The trip was to DD Hills.\n\nThe DD Hills is an ecological park situated\
  \ at an altitude of 3940 feet above sea level in Karnataka.which originates from\
  \ the Shimsha and Jayamankali rivers, is situated on top of a hill. Dinesh is a\
  \ place where tourists can visit this temple.\n\nWe started our journey at 6 o'clock\
  \ in the morning. There was no 4 * 4 carriage for the ride.\n\nTo get to the DD\
  \ Hills you need to go through the jungle path.\n\nThe forest on both sides, the\
  \ evergreen green forest, the green and the coolest in the morning, the weather\
  \ is cool.\nThe car has a better performance than expected.\n\nThe journey through\
  \ ECOLOGICAL PARK will be eye-catching. Probably the bike are more suitable for\
  \ such a route than the car.\n\nThe DD hills are located 71 km from Bangalore and\
  \ 19 km from Tumkur of Karnataka state.\n\nThe attraction of this ecology park is\
  \ \na water source, according to hindu mythology\nLord Raman came jungle, a place\
  \ where  water he didn't find out. By his super power he hit on a rock and it was\
  \ split open and the spring emerged from it.\nThis is a waterless spring.\n\n\_\
  The protection of this ecological park is under Karnataka govt, \n\nWe can see a\
  \ lot of school students here. It is a unique experience to know the different animals\
  \ and plants in their realm.\n\_\n\nWhen the 2-3 hire climbs on the road, the steps\
  \ on the side of the road were visible. It is a vital arrangement for those who\
  \ walk through the temple. It grows to the main stage of the temple.\n\n\nWe can\
  \ only get enter to top of the temple, by using the stairs. Traders are trying to\
  \ get our attention.\n\nOn the one side of the DD Hills we have a good view point.\
  \ We started to climb the steps to the temple. There are various kinds of idols\
  \ on the side.\n\n\nThe temple is located on the foothills of the hill.\n\_3 parts\
  \ are surrounded by a huge granite. It sounds good. The temple is over 4000 feet\
  \ high.\n\nThe temple has a home that claims to have historic significance.\nThere\
  \ is a tunnel inside the temple. A stream corridor full names 'Sreepadha Theertham',\
  \ it is not clear where it should be.\n\nThere is a big pond and well in front of\
  \ the house.It's okay. The pool is almost wintered and the temple needs to be built.\n\
  \nDDHills could be called as a beautiful little hill station with no rain or snow.\n\
  \nIt is about 300 meters away from the opposite side.\n\nOn the bicycle, there was\
  \ a group of young people who had seen DD Hills.\nThe next step to reach top path\
  \ through the narrow path seeing front of the temple.\nWe need to hold the pond\
  \ of the pool.\n\nYou can experience the fountain View Point  there. The sight of\
  \ the eyes is cool for the sleeves.\n\nThere's a big crater here too. It's green.\
  \ It's a big rock that's pulling out from the ground. It's the end. I just stood\
  \ on it. It's cool. The body and mind are just like a feather, it is a special blessing\
  \ to get your hands together. When you stand in the infinity of nature, the wind\
  \ will feel like it's a shower.\n\nThe three sides are green. We looked around for\
  \ a long time, or it was supposed to be from them.\n\nThere are some houses that\
  \ look like the dots.\n\nProbably 1-2 deaths were occur here, annually. Those who\
  \ have fallen out of their lives, or they measured depth of this valley.\n\nThe\
  \ sun had to go away from here before the atmosphere was heated.i spend atleast\
  \ two hours whole round.\nThough it has been visited by DD Hills many times before,\
  \ it was the first time for the view point.\n\nWhen you get a chance, you can go\
  \ in here and get back to your destination. With a handful of good experience."
