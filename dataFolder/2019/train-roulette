Text: "It was train roulette at its finest. \n\nMy friend and I hovered over the haggard\
  \ ticket machine at Roma Termini, staring down at the \u201CDestination\u201D Field.\
  \ We only had one goal that day: Get good and lost. \n\n\u201CS?\u201D \n\u201C\
  S.\u201D \n\nI punched the grubby screen. A litany of Italian S-named cities sprang\
  \ to life. We scrolled. \n\n\u201CStop. That one. I have no idea where that is.\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CLet\u2019s go.\u201D\n\nTwo hours and thirty-six minutes later, our train\
  \ paused briefly to exhale us - and only us - out onto the desolate train station.\
  \ \n\nExiting the station - a crimson building housing two toilets and one sleepy-eyed\
  \ barista behind a glistening espresso machine - our eyes gazed up, and up, and\
  \ up: Purgatory stood between us and the stoned fortress holding in our final destination.\
  \ \n\nThe hill in front of us wasn\u2019t long, but it was punishingly steep. \n\
  \nWe looked to our right: a lonely taxi stand. The taxi driver\u2019s lonelier eyes\
  \ lingered on us.\n\nToday was not a day for that kind of luxury. Or desperation.\n\
  \n\u201CHoof it?\u201D\n\u201CLet\u2019s do it.\u201D \n\nThe setting sun gave us\
  \ the urgency we needed. My friend, with her beloved and well-used hiking pack,\
  \ and I, with my sturdy two wheel carry-on, slogged up the hill up to what we prayed\
  \ - to any and every god - was, indeed, civilization.\n\nLugging the weight of our\
  \ separate bags and joint restlessness, each step closer to an answer. The warm\
  \ stones beneath our feet had soaked in the Perugian sun with the same way savoiardi\
  \ ladyfingers perfectly soak in espresso-laced rum. \n\nWe approached the looming\
  \ wall, an ancient arch opened to the one entry. Oversized letters looked upon us\
  \ like curious clouds, announcing our home for the night: S P E L L O . \n\nMy wheeled\
  \ bag clopping behind me, we strolled up Spello\u2019s narrow streets, streets made\
  \ vibrant with blooming flowers hanging along every window frame. We breathed their\
  \ rootedness; we breathed in everything we were not. \n\n\u201CWell, friend, I suppose\
  \ we need somewhere to sleep?\u201D\n\u201CIndeed.\u201D \n\nDiscovering a small\
  \ bed and breakfast brought unspoken relief. A bar sat next to the front desk, empty\
  \ of guests and half-full of bottles. We laughed as the single employee offered\
  \ a dungeon cell-sized key and amused smile. In this grounded, contemplative town,\
  \ we stood out. \n\nAfter a short rest, I ventured back down to the lobby to wait\
  \ for my friend. The warm, worn bar beckoned. \n\nAn elderly man meandered up to\
  \ me. He must have been over seventy-five, his wiry eyebrows shadowing the movement\
  \ of his laugh lines. His left brow raised in question, Italian words tumbled to\
  \ my ears, inquiring if I would like anything\n\n\u201CAvete limoncello?\u201D [Do\
  \ you have limoncello?] I asked, my unwilling tongue putting up a protest. I had\
  \ been studying Italian for two years and still found myself tortuously humbled\
  \ in a way only attempting a new language can offer. \n\nHe smiled generously, nodding\
  \ his head. \n\u201CCerto.\u201D [Of course.]\n\nHis thin skinned hands pulled out\
  \ a chilled glass bottle from the under counter cooler and two polished glasses.\
  \ \n\nI sank into the bar stool as the syrupy golden liquid filled the hourglass\
  \ glasses between us. \n\n\u201CCin cin!\u201D \n\u201CCin cin!\u201D \n\nClinking\
  \ our glasses, we each took in a sip. The cold tart boozy liquid hit my tongue.\
  \ \nI took another sip. And another. \n\nI leaned into the limoncello and into my\
  \ courage - and Italian - to ask about his life. \n\nA gate of emotion and authenticity\
  \ rushed opened. \n\nHe poured out stories: of growing up in Spello, of growing\
  \ old in Spello. He told of his family, of the generations, of hundreds of years\
  \ of roots planted here. He told of the changes he had seen, of the losses, the\
  \ joys. He decanted limoncello and Spello in equal measure. \n\nI listened in awe.\
  \ Not of his lack of lostness, but so much his found-ness. His calm in the midst\
  \ of all he he had, and all he didn\u2019t. His life wasn\u2019t cause for anxiety,\
  \ but reflection, appreciation.\n\nIn that moment, I realized the walls of Spello\
  \ weren't offering an answer from the external, but internal; not one of simple\
  \ refuge, but of redemption."
