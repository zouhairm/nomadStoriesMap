Text: 'I am proudly Mexican, and I decided to study hotel and restaurants management,
  because I wanted to know the entire world because of my profesion. Before even started
  into the traveling world, when I began working into a hotel, I discovered that the
  tourists wanted to make a real connection with me and with my culture, and at the
  same time I wanted to feel conected to them, so talking about how is my country,
  my people, my culture, my food and the weather, make me feel more proud and at the
  same time more curious about their countries.

  We started talking about how different our countries were, how special it was to
  coincide in the same moment of life to share a good conversation, memories and thoughts,
  so then it was when I started to travel, through others, by expresing ourserlfs
  and sharing our lifes, like if we would came from a different world, for us, it
  was like that, and it was amazing to make the tourists to know the back ground of
  my country and culture by deep conversations and exchanging what it made us different
  from eachother but so similar at the same time, I would like to study to express
  myself properly to let all the world know how important is to connect with people,
  because empty places will not be that great as with the local people who make special
  every trip and every place, all of us, as humans, we are conected and if we find
  the kind way to connect ourselves, it will be the best way to know the history and
  meaning of every corner of this wonderful world.'
