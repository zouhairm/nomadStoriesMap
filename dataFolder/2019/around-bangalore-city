Text: "Madhugiri, 100km from Bangalore's CBD. Bengaluru - Tumkur Highway.  17/11/18\
  \ \n(FB post - 35)\n\n\nThe drive from Cunningham Road to Madhugiri started at 8am.\n\
  We went via Tumkur highway and an hour into the drive, we stopped at a darshini\
  \ setup for breakfast. Having idli and dosas, ending bit with coffee, we resumed\
  \ our journey.\nAfter about another 40mins we reached a beautiful lake point on\
  \ the right.\nMaking a pitstop, we clicked pictures and explored the surrounding.\n\
  After about 15mins, we continued driving until the destination arrived.\nThe high\
  \ court of Madhugiri is an excellent piece of architecture in the neighborhood.\n\
  Reaching the parking spot, we drove into an arch, crossed several pillars and sculptures.\n\
  The trek started at 11.00am.\nIt was a walk through the ancient times, capturing\
  \ one ruin after the other, following the granite path.\nA local man gave us prasaad\
  \ from the temple there, teaching his son that no matter which God you worship,\
  \ there's only one God for everyone!\nWalking ahead, we met a few people who mentioned\
  \ that we have another 1.5hrs to reach the top!\nThe view kept getting better with\
  \ every step.\nAt a certain point, the railings were replaced by a rope. An uncle\
  \ warned us to go only if we were super confident. Assuming that if the uncle could\
  \ do it then of course, even I could, I panicked at that particular point.\nI was\
  \ stuck. There was no way in front, behind, up or down. My friend just asked me\
  \ to look staright at him, and keep moving slowly. I did. And finally waved to everyone\
  \ looking, that I was alright.\nMarching up and hiking, the peak never came. There\
  \ is minimal foliage and no shade to rest. \nContinuing up, with breaks at every\
  \ 100th step, we reached the fort by 01.00pm. \nMadhugiri Fort is by far the cleanest\
  \ trek that I've done in all my treks around the state as it is least populated\
  \ by tourists!\nThis exquisite archeological site is a single monolith, largest\
  \ in Asia. \nThe climb of 2000steps marked the fitness benchmark!\nExploring through\
  \ the derelict structures, the feeling of having such a majestic structure on top\
  \ of a hill left me speechless. \nRunning out of water, we spent about 30mins there\
  \ before the descent.\nIt took us 1hr to get back down.\nDriving back to Bangalore\
  \ City, we stopped on the way for a juice as we found zero decent darshini or restaurants\
  \ for a meal. By 4.30pm we reached the city centre.\n\nOvercoming mind blocks at\
