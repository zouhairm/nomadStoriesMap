Text: "Actual time, 18:12 pm, GMT +1. \nPerceived time, somewhere between timelessness\
  \ and a good old twenty years ago, when the Earth was purer, life easier, greens\
  \ fresher, people more human.\nLocation, an uncarpeted seat on a bus scrolling its\
  \ wheels on an un unpaved road in the middle of the Bulgarian land, bringing me\
  \ and three retired elders from the lost village of Katunci to the big metropolitan\
  \ jungle of Sofia. \nWe stop for a cigarette break in the town of Blagoevgrad. Turns\
  \ out that it is not only a cigarette break stop, but that it is also functional\
  \ to pick up a couple more souls on the way to urban salvation. A man aged sixty-two\
  \ or so seats on the uncarpeted seat next to mine. \nIn Bulgarian, but with a strong\
  \ and undetermined accent between that of a ranch owner from Texas and a Russian\
  \ politician, he asks me where I'm bound. \nI answer I am going to Sofia to visit\
  \ some relatives I have not seen in ten years, after having been to Katunci to visit\
  \ some other relatives I had not seen in ten years. Then, a bit out of politeness\
  \ but really out of pure fascination and curiosity, I investigate on my fellow's\
  \ backgrounds and foregrounds. He tells me he has lived in ten different countries,\
  \ but that he does not belong to any of those. He has a Bulgarian passport, but\
  \ he keeps it only for convenience: \"Bulgarian citizenship gives you the advantages\
  \ of European citizenship. But this is not really Europe, so it is okay\", he states.\
  \ \nIntrigued by this traveller's ideas, I insist on knowing where he actually comes\
  \ from. He looks at me straight in the eyes, squeezes his short-sighted lids to\
  \ see me more clearly, writhes his cracked lips into a smile and asserts: \"the\
  \ place I come from only exists in history books. My country is not a country anymore\"\
  . \n\"What do you mean, sir?\", I calmly go on. \n\"I am from a great, huge nation.\
  \ It was called Jugoslavia. If you go to my birthplace of Podgorica now, they will\
  \ tell you it is Montenegro. I am no Montenegrin. I am no Bulgarian. I have no roots,\
  \ no home, no nation. The only thing I have is nostalgia, pride and a quasi-European\
  \ passport\", he answers. What had previously started off as a grin has now turned\
  \ into a truly amused smile. \nHe loosens himself, starts telling me about his continuous\
  \ movings, about how and why he got this passport from this country out of all the\
  \ passports from all the countries he could possibly apply to, about his current\
  \ nonexistent job as a nonexistent retired Jugoslavian in New York City.\nI do not\
  \ know whether to believe him or not, but for some reason I feel he has no reason\
  \ to lie. Also, I feel he has no need to be there.\nTo be honest though, where could\
  \ he have the need to be? \nThere is no going back to his country for him, for his\
  \ country will not be brought back ever again.\nStill, we are now together on this\
  \ bus, rolling between Blagoevgrad and Sofia.\nThe unpaved road has turned into\
  \ a disrupted highway. The cold day has turned into a cold night. The Balkan mountains,\
  \ reigning upon this kingdom of no one, never change their mysterious and melancholic\
  \ look over this landscape. \nThe driver who smokes inside of his bus without caring\
  \ about European regulations and the Jugoslavian-Monetengrin man with a Bulgarian\
  \ passport who sits next to me without caring about European citizenship, they will\
  \ never turn you over to anyone. \nActual time now, 19:55 pm, GMT +1. \nPerceived\
  \ time, somewhere between the year in which Jugoslavia was created and the year\
  \ in which it ceased to exist.\nLocation, the same uncarpeted seat on the same bus.\
  \ Actually, it is now time to take my butt off from it. We just stopped in Sofia.\
  \ Sofia is our final stop.\nTime for a cigarette. Time for more time to pass."
