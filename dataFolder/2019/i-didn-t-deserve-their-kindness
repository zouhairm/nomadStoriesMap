Text: "I rolled my eyes at Tom. A large group of Chinese-speaking tourists were gathering\
  \ around me, taking selfies and having fun. These were the people I would trek through\
  \ the Malaysian jungle with. Ahead of us lay two days of hiking in the oldest rainforest\
  \ in the world: Taman Negara National Park. \u201EHave fun!\u201C said Tom, obviously\
  \ amused. \u201EYeah right\u201C, I thought, internally bidding farewell to my authentic\
  \ jungle experience...\n\nThe tour guides split us into two groups - one \u201E\
  Chinese\u201C and one \u201EWestern\u201C.The latter was composed of a French couple,\
  \ two German travellers and myself. I felt relieved \u2013 this had the potential\
  \ to become a great trek! We hopped into a few motorized wooden boats and traveled\
  \ up the Tembeling river for about an hour, leaving the little town of Kuala Tahan\
  \ behind us. At midday we reached our entry point and started hiking, the Chinese\
  \ group walking a few minutes behind us.\n\nAccompanied by the distant cries of\
  \ gibbon monkeys and the buzzing of millions of insects, we silently followed the\
  \ earthy path, stumbling over roots and crawling under and over massive fallen tree\
  \ trunks occasionally blocking our way. Suddenly, after about half an hour, something\
  \ dark the size of a monkey was rustling in the bushes, crossed our path and disappeared\
  \ back into the underbrush. Our young guide froze. \u201EBaby bear\u201C, he whispered,\
  \ \u201Eif mama bear is near she is very aggressive\u201C. He was undergoing training\
  \ and decided that we should wait for the more experienced guide who was leading\
  \ the Chinese group. After discussing the situation we slowly continued our hike\
  \ as one large group. The incident was soon forgotten and the Chinese were having\
  \ a great time, chatting and taking selfies which I tried my best to stay out of.\
  \ A few hours later we reached our shelter for the night: a bat cave. We established\
  \ our camps inside, the Chinese lit their base with torches and chatted gaily as\
  \ dinner was being prepared. A few feet aside, our group ate silently, swallowed\
  \ by the cave's damp blackness.\n\nIt rained overnight. When we got back onto our\
  \ loop trail the following day, it had transformed into a muddy mess. Instead of\
  \ a small stream occasionally crossing our path, now big pools of reddish-brown\
  \ water blocked our path. At first, the guides used their machetes to cut a way\
  \ around them, but that was to no avail \u2013 we had to get our feet wet. Without\
  \ hesitation, the Chinese followed the guides into the water, grabbed a few floating\
  \ tree trunks for support and remained in the water, helping us get across. The\
  \ hike had transpired into a disaster. We were stuck in it together. Every time\
  \ we left one pool behind, another appeared. Eventually, I started talking to one\
  \ of the Chinese \u2013 and immediately wished for the ground to open up and swallow\
  \ me (which, ironically, was actually kind of happening). The people I had labelled\
  \ as \u201Cloud Chinese tourists\u201D were actually a group of Malaysian friends\
  \ who were on holiday together! In fact, it was not their first time visiting Taman\
  \ Negara. As if the situation wasn't bad enough already, I strained my knee. As\
  \ I was hobbling through the rainforest, one of the Malaysians took my backpack\
  \ while another walked next to me for support. I knew I wasn't deserving of their\
  \ kindness but at the same time felt extremely grateful for it.\n\nEventually, the\
  \ jungle spit us out again. Our adventure had made us bond and a day later my newly\
  \ found friends offered me a ride to their home town Melaka. If it weren't for the\
  \ photos on my laptop, I wouldn't believe that on the way there, we had lunch at\
  \ a Chinese restaurant together, ate ice cream in the emerald gardens of a monastery\
  \ and took group photos in the middle of an avenue of trees. Or that, upon arriving\
  \ in Melaka, I was invited into one of the men's homes and got introduced to his\
  \ pregnant wife.\n\nI had entered the jungle searching for an authentic experience\
  \ and ended up looking deeper into Malaysia's heart than I could have ever expected."
