Text: "Situated on the southern coast of Sardinia and forty kilometers away from Cagliari,\
  \ Santa Magueritta di Pula consists of fine beaches, jade sea, visitors and visages\
  \ that don\u2019t change over the years.\n\nIts water hardly roars and its sand\
  \ gives holiday-makers gentle kisses. Except for the Forte Village, the exclusive\
  \ resort mostly possessed by athletes and Russians, locals stay and socialize in\
  \ the long stretch of its beach. \n\nThick, abundant and curly at shoulder\u2019\
  s length, Guilianna\u2019s hair is too thriving to discover its scalp underneath,\
  \ unless she soaks them the whole three times in the sea. She owns a two-story villa\
  \ that her grandparents left to her and stays there every summer. It is where her\
  \ heart resides, her son\u2019s heart and her daughter\u2019s heart reside.\n\n\
  Across her villa stays a family from Milan. The father is a professor and his younger\
  \ son Giacomo looks handsome, albeit his genetics of obesity inherited from his\
  \ family. He sweats himself with two-hour cross-fit and eats only salad. But the\
  \ genes are somewhat in-erasable. Guillianna feels he would return to his teen weight\
  \ at the speed of light once he gave up.\n \nAcross Giacomo\u2019s villa lives Rebbeta,\
  \ a petit Felliniesque figure that shouts and dances all the time. \n\n\"Don\u2019\
  t look at my ass and picture it as a Brazilian one,\u201D she cried out while twisting\
  \ her hips.\n\nRebbeta lives off her ancestors\u2019 properties and sells them one\
  \ by one. She doesn't sell the house in Santa Magueritta and it remains the only\
  \ one left.\n\nDespite cellulite she displays and shakes her ass almost every day\
  \ on the beach, narrating her decline and fall over these years, as if only by telling\
  \ the plight instead of pain could embody her dignity as a true European. \n\nItalian\
  \ vocations are unmindful. The afternoon starts at four if lucky and the dinner\
  \ is unfolded with the moon and pine trees in the darkness. Their strategy is just\
  \ to go to the sea, and everything has its own rhythm and timing to pop out: the\
  \ impressionistic sea that varies its color, the gigantic spider that suddenly can\u2019\
  t find its way, and the gymnastic girl that exhibits her tattooed breast ravishingly.\
  \ \n\nEvery one is waiting. Proactively waiting at sea. And there is always an acquaintance\
  \ that you know and haven\u2019t seen for many years. This holiday method will drive\
  \ Germans nuts, the opposite species expert at making a complete plan and arriving\
  \ at the museum at seven sharp. \n\nRain is a scarce visitor of Santa Magueritta.\
  \ Even if a dark cloud looms and thunders roll around, no one runs away until this\
  \ slow dark cloud flows right above their head. \n\nThe aftermath of a summer rain,\
  \ however, brings about a tragic displacement. Guilianna, Giacomo and Rebbeta are\
  \ forced to eat in the living room, where it is hardly of any use but a space for\
  \ tubes, rafts and kids. \n\nWhen it is not raining, fruits, cheeses and mosquitos\
  \ abound in their yards. Friends bring a homemade Sebadas to pay a visit, a Sardinian\
  \ pastry filled with cheese and drizzled with honey. They will soon be rewarded\
  \ with a cup of Mirto, a summer popular liquor made from myrtles in Sardinia. \n\
  \nItalian vocation is about recount and reencounter. Is about immersion in time\
  \ and water. Is about lay your heart bare in the sun. Is about adolescent flare\
  \ and elderly glare. Is about mopping up your plate and do \u201Cscarpetta\u201D\
  . Is about back to the sea again and again.\n\nItalian vocation is to go with a\
  \ flow of circle, so that you come back and let your heart reside there ever since.\n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019ve been to a lot of seaside,\u201D said Giacomo. \u201CBut I\u2019\
  ve never see any sea like Santa Magueritta. It is my youth bath.\u201D\n\nIt is\
  \ where Sardinians are baptized by the sun and the blue."
