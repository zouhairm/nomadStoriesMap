Text: "Traveling alone to a different territory is and will always be scary. I\u2019\
  ve actually read this sentence over and over again but it doesn\u2019t sound reassuring,\
  \ does it? Well, it is a whole lot scarier for someone like me \u2014 someone who\
  \ has major depression and generalized anxiety disorders. On a daily basis, the\
  \ unknown is ghastly. I\u2019m the type of person who plans days ahead, sometimes\
  \ even weeks in advance, to feel secure. Yes, I am on medication to help minimize\
  \ the chemicals imbalance and prevent any major nervous breakdowns. Nonetheless,\
  \ the idea of seeking this any new adventures \u2014 by myself \u2014 is still terrifying.\
  \ It gets my heart racing... sometimes good and sometimes bad.\n\nOf course, let\u2019\
  s start with the unwanted questions that everyone has to ask. Over and over, I get\
  \ remarks like, \u201CYou\u2019re going alone??\u201D or \u201CIsn\u2019t it scary?\u201D\
  \ or \u201CWhy aren\u2019t you traveling with someone?\u201D Whether you suffer\
  \ from depression/anxiety or not, the conventional agreement seems to be that going\
  \ on vacation without a friend automatically makes you a loner. OBVIOUSLY, that\
  \ is a social construction (heh, my sociology major is doing me some good). SO if\
  \ you have to know, I actually love doing things that people are afraid of. I like\
  \ a challenge. In the end, I do get compliments of being brave or tenacious. My\
  \ advice? Be yourself, and definitely don\u2019t let the negative comments be intimidating.\
  \ The truth: I can confirm that traveling alone is fun, rewarding, and healthy in\
  \ many ways. \n\nFor as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve always struggled with\
  \ being by myself. I couldn\u2019t stand it; I\u2019ve always felt lonely even in\
  \ a big crowd. The funny part is that I struggle with being a big crowd as well\
  \ because my anxiety takes over. I felt lost. I used to a cry a lot. I used to miss\
  \ school or go half way only to go home. I once missed a scholarship interview which\
  \ could have given me $5,000; even my mentor emailed and told me he would have written\
  \ a check if I had just shown up. I was unable to deal with my mental state. This\
  \ was before I started therapy. \n\nMy mental state worsened when I got to college.\
  \ I was officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety\
  \ disorder. Yes, before I knew that I had these, but I was in counseling. It\u2019\
  s definitely different than seeing an actual psychologist/psychiatrist who can diagnose\
  \ and prescribe you medication.\n\nIn 2017, I started my medication. I went on and\
  \ then off... unsure of what it was really doing for me. Not because I didn\u2019\
  t believe that it would help me, but the fact that I wasn't facing the truth. In\
  \ late 2016, I was also dealing with a major break-up and I felt low for days. But\
  \ because it was a new year, I knew that I needed to reflect and do what is best\
  \ for me. \nPart of the problem was that I wasn\u2019t fully myself. What do I mean\
  \ by that? I struggled A LOT in high school. I didn\u2019t exactly have a great\
  \ group of friends who supported me or fully understood me. There was also the fact\
  \ that no one really tried to. There were only acquaintances because it\u2019s convenient;\
  \ we spent six periods a day together and saw each other five days a week... that's\
  \ a lot if you ask me. Though, it wasn\u2019t just at school. At home, I couldn\u2019\
  t talk to anyone. My older sister and I weren't close at the time and my alcoholic\
  \ father was barely in the picture. Everything felt wrong.\n\nThose who have been\
  \ through the same can TOTALLY relate. I felt alone. My mind continuously asked\
  \ myself what is wrong with me. I blamed myself for everything that was happening.\
  \ It was painful. \n\nI think I woke up one day realizing that the people at my\
  \ high school didn't deserve my friendship. I just remembered telling myself that\
  \ college was the way out. If I can get out of this hell hole of a school and home,\
  \ then I could do anything. I slowly took my time for a change."
