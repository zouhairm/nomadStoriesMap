Text: "To challenge and change oneself takes courage. For me, this courage came when\
  \ I was sitting at my work desk scrolling aimlessly through my Instagram feed when\
  \ I came across an advert for a volunteering opportunity in Nepal with the International\
  \ Citizenship Service. Discovering more about this opportunity only fuelled my excitement\
  \ for it to the point where I said to myself \"why not?\". After all, I would be\
  \ visiting a land of golden temples, mighty mountains, and unique wildlife all under\
  \ a blanket of prayer flags.\n\nAhead of me, laid a road filled with uncertainty.\
  \ I would be living in the rural green hillsides of Makwanpur Nepal without family\
  \ and friends, Wi-Fi, running water, sitting toilets, a shower, and nearly every\
  \ other western luxury you can list off the top of your head. On top of all this,\
  \ I would be spending my time with a group of volunteers I barely knew working and\
  \ living in a community of people who I do not share the same language with.\n\n\
  My mindset was that of a true traveller. Arriving at Heathrow London Airport I expected\
  \ that someone from the volunteer organisation would meet me there and travel with\
  \ the volunteers to Nepal. This was not the case. Once signed in we were left to\
  \ our own devices. It appeared to me that every stage of this journey would present\
  \ with it new experiences. Armed with the curiosity of an adventurer I set off with\
  \ a group of 30 other English volunteers to meet the Nepalese volunteers who we\
  \ would be sharing our lives with for the next 3 months.\n\nNepal is a landlocked\
  \ country best known for being home to 8 of the 10 tallest peaks in the world including\
  \ Mt Everest located in the famous Himalayas. What is less known about the country\
  \ is how diverse its cultures are. I use the word culture as a plural to emphasise\
  \ just how many cultures there are! Nepal speaks over 120 different languages and\
  \ is a place where every religion is accepted. Throughout all this diversity, Nepal\
  \ has always kept a sense of one nation. Every person I met loved their country.\
  \ This feeling of community is less common in the UK and a very welcomed experience\
  \ in Nepal. So, in this new land full of diversity with a strong sense of itself,\
  \ how was I to find my place? \n\nThe answer is trust. If I was to settle into my\
  \ new home and drink every ounce of knowledge from the experience, I had to have\
  \ trust in my own capabilities to adapt. Some things in my new way of life came\
  \ naturally like washing outside and eating on the floor, whereas other things like\
  \ using a squat toilet and communicating without using any words did not come so\
  \ naturally. Through time and experience, I came to know these everyday practices\
  \ as second nature which, therefore gave me free time to put back into helping the\
  \ local community. \n\nI may not have known what I was getting myself into however,\
  \ I know what I have been left with. I was left with a place I can truly call a\
  \ second home, stories to tell, and a newly gained perspective of planet Earth and\
  \ the people of it. From taking a leap into the unknown I was able to escape the\
  \ everyday, find peace of mind in the mountains, follow the rivers flow through\
  \ to new lands, and be at one with nature."
