Text: "I was running. Running away from two Italian cups, shouting \u201CSignora!\
  \ Signora!\u201D At that point, I felt like alive. I felt like I am limitless. I\
  \ was happy. I could just run to everywhere and anywhere I want. I laughed loudly.\
  \ I was drunk as hell. And definitely not athletic, so that my escape didn\u2019\
  t last long. \n\nI was 19 and it was the first time that I\u2019ve travelled abroad\
  \ alone. This was something huge for the background that I come from. I was in Naples,\
  \ the city of Neapolitans -not Italians, per favore!-, involved in a social responsibility\
  \ project. I became friends with other participants immediately. That night, we\
  \ decided to dine out, explore the beauty of Italian cuisine and gain a couple of\
  \ pounds. We went to a little family restaurant with red and white tablecloths.\
  \ It was a warm evening, even warmer with ongoing furnace inside the restaurant.\
  \ The owner was a charming, friendly, naughty and flirty Neapolitan men which seems\
  \ to enjoy his time to talking to 4 foreign girls with his inadequate English. The\
  \ enthusiasm he had was filling the all restaurant. He offered us drinks and so\
  \ on. We drunk too many shots of limoncello, thought that wasn\u2019t enough; continued\
  \ with melon cello. The owner seemed to be satisfied to see us with full stomachs\
  \ and tipsy smiles. \nHe said, \u201CA woman must always be fed up!\u201D. So, he\
  \ did to 4 women.\n\nAs we said goodbye to him and thanked for the free limoncello,\
  \ we walked towards to narrow but light streets of Naples. I could see the dwellers,\
  \ smoking in their balcony while watching the people cross by their territory. One\
  \ old lady smiled and waved to us. I tried to wave back, probably failed to do it\
  \ properly. \n\nFollow the road of Via Toledo, there is this beautiful square in\
  \ Naples, called Piazza del Plebiscito. In the basilica side, there are plenty of\
  \ statues of animals pointing out the royal spirit such as lions, horses. With the\
  \ help of limoncello, and meloncello, I decided to ride a lion. I was lucky enough\
  \ to have supportive friends, although 2 of them were sober. I went directly to\
  \ one of the lion sculptures, climb on it and sit on the top. I was feeling like\
  \ I am the queen of the square! I was free, limitless! I started to sing Izmir anthem,\
  \ without any purpose or reason. I was proud and having fun, that\u2019s for sure.\
  \ Until, the sounds of \u201CSignora!\u201D helped me to forget all the cellos I\
  \ had. I was scared of hell, so that I jumped on my lion and started to run. My\
  \ friends started to run with me.  \n\nAll my life, I felt like I do not belong\
  \ where I am and dreamed about going away. I dreamed about leaving people and the\
  \ place behind me. I pictured all my dreams in the place that I will go. I didn\u2019\
  t know where I\u2019ll go or where is the perfect place to me. I still don\u2019\
  t, even though I moved out from my hometown, Istanbul. I still dreaming about going.\
  \ \n\nThis \u201Crebel\u201D experience of mine is too precious. Not only it\u2019\
  s an extremely cool drunk story, but also the realization that I\u2019ve gained\
  \ from it. It is exactly what they say: \u201CIt is not the destination, but the\
  \ journey\u201D. The feeling of going, running, moving; this is my dharma. I do\
  \ not know where the next destination is, and I don\u2019t care. Because I am sure,\
  \ I\u2019ll enjoy the journey.\n\nAnd what happened after? Of course, they caught\
  \ us! They only wanted to warn us. We all had a nice chat. They offered to give\
  \ us a ride. We refused. At the end, the night was young; so are we."
