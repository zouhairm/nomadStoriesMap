Text: "I wondered if they could smell me coming, because I could smell them as I crossed\
  \ the little wooden pier and passed the guard stationed on the plastic chair at\
  \ the end of the hotel property, just where the sanitized beach stopped and the\
  \ real one began. I put on my flip-flops on and nodded to the bored guard in his\
  \ starched uniform shirt and tie. I became aware of the scents of hotel bodywash\
  \ on my skin and shampoo in my hair\u2015and thought, this is the scent of Iberostar.\
  \ Of tourists. We all smell the same when we\u2019re here. Can they smell the Hotel\
  \ People before they see them?\n\nI\u2019d started out about twenty minutes before,\
  \ with the idea of a long beach walk, past the blare and spectacle of beach aerobics,\
  \ past symmetrical rows of reddening sunbathers, past waiters bearing Red Stripe\
  \ and pina coladas. And suddenly, my little all-inclusive universe just \u2026 ended.\
  \ Never able to turn back, anytime or anywhere, I always need to discover what\u2019\
  s Over There. Climbing over the pier planks, wading around a group of tightly twisted\
  \ trees, I finally saw the source of the fragrant smoke.\n\nRows of makeshift shacks\
  \ stood hard against each other. Wood carvings, wet brushes and open jars of poster\
  \ paint, shells, t-shirts, wind chimes, and hundreds of other handmade or mass-produced\
  \ souvenirs buckled shelves and tables inside. Rough lobster traps lay at water\u2019\
  s edge. A white mongrel with a black belly ran to me, tail wagging. A group of dark\
  \ lean men, some without shirts and shoes, stood or sat, talking with each other\
  \ or painting or smoking.\n\n\u201CMiss, you come look at my shop?\u201D\n\nAt my\
  \ elbow was a woman with a very pink headscarf, urging me up a row of shacks. I\
  \ allowed myself to be led along, even though I had no money on me, and told her\
  \ so. \"S\u2019okay. You just look.\u201D Rushed up the little sandy hill, I saw\
  \ that the parallel rows of \u201Cshops\u201D formed a kind of village. Men were\
  \ whittling, making fires, pulling seaweed from traps; women sat together on tree-trunks\
  \ near tables of jewelry; three children ran after a couple of brown dogs. Some\
  \ people watched us as I walked alongside Pink Lady to her shack, and I felt self-conscious.\
  \ I love traveling more than anything else, but only as a gracious participant,\
  \ not a greedy consumer. Even the notion of a \u201Cvacation\u201D is a first-world\
  \ construct; most of the Jamaicans I came to know during my trip had never left\
  \ the island, let alone Saint James Parish.\n\n\"Dat is Xena, da Warrior Fisher\
  \ Dog. She catches tirty feesh a day.\"\n\nA man who introduced himself as Chris\
  \ leaned against his own shack and laughed as I bent down to hug a beach dog who\
  \ was generous with her kissing, wagging, and happy eyes. With pride in his voice,\
  \ Chris told me about her puppies \"back in America,\" taken home by a tourist last\
  \ year\u2015as if every Caribbean dog dreamed of such an honor. I threatened to\
  \ steal Xena, too.\n\n\u201CYou steal dat dog, you break Ev-er-ee-bodee's heart\
  \ on dis beach,\" was his solemn reply as he motioned up and down the rows. I had\
  \ to laugh. With three large dogs and an untold number of cats already inhabiting\
  \ my house and porch in Philadelphia, smuggling a Jamaican fishing dog into the\
  \ mix had only been my weak attempt at a joke. \"I would never do that, Chris,\"\
  \ I said as I tried to keep a straight face. Four or five guys who also worked on\
  \ the beach walked by just then, and casually invited me to sit and have a drink\
  \ with them. They look surprised but happy when I shrugged and said, \"Sure, why\
  \ not?\" Guiding me to an empty shack that was usually occupied, they said, by a\
  \ Rastafarian (\"Rasta-Mon not worken' today\"), they directed me to sit on a tree\
  \ stump as they took their own places on rocks and other stumps under the roof tarp\
  \ amid the empty shelves. Soon one of the guys cracked open a beer, everybody laughed\
  \ and smoked, and the conversation was a-rolling."
