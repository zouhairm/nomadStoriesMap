Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find rain in Africa.\n\nI went during the dry season,\
  \ or at least, it was supposed to be. But for a month of my eleven weeks in the\
  \ semi-desert of northern Kenya, it rained nearly every day. First would come a\
  \ wind, whipping up dust and grit and sending us all scuttling inside. The light\
  \ turned watery and dim, a gray-brown filter over everything. \n\nThen came the\
  \ rains. The first time it rained, we\u2014my fellow study abroad students and I\u2014\
  danced in it. We got soaked, skirts and shirts and cargo pants sticking to our skin.\
  \ The rain washed away the desiccating heat that none of us were used to yet.\n\
  Within a few minutes, the shower was over. It was short, but it rained hard, which\
  \ continued to be the trend. The floor of our dorms flooded, then dried within an\
  \ hour. The dirt sucked up the water like a sponge. The sun would come back out,\
  \ if it had ever left in the first place\u2014the sky was certainly wide enough\
  \ to fit both storm and sun. Soon enough, the only remnant of the rain was the heaviness\
  \ of the air, the humidity index soaring and staying high for hours after the shower.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find rain in Africa, regardless of the Toto song one\
  \ of my fellow students played the first time it happened. I\u2019d gone to a dry\
  \ area in the dry season, expecting dry heat. But climate change affects the globe,\
  \ and Kenya is no exception. The river by one of our program sites was dry for the\
  \ first time any of our professors could remember, and it was only after weeks of\
  \ those unseasonal rains that it filled and started to rush again. It wasn\u2019\
  t a small river, either, that had dried up, but one three or four feet deep all\
  \ the way across the thousand-foot width. The river stretches for miles, and it\
  \ is not supposed to be seasonal.\n\nThis was the first time I\u2019d ever been\
  \ presented with truly dangerous consequences of climate change up close and personal.\
  \ No longer was it just statistics, or lukewarm warnings from friends followed by\
  \ heated denial by family. It was here. \n\nIn the three months I spent in Kenya,\
  \ it didn\u2019t feel like home. It wasn\u2019t that we stayed anywhere inhospitable,\
  \ or that I felt unwelcome. I knew that my roots had not been put down here; my\
  \ line, along with everyone else\u2019s, started in the Rift Valley. I was probably\
  \ the first person in my lineage to step foot in Kenya since my ancestors left tens\
  \ of thousands of years; I am not pretentious enough to claim the country as my\
  \ own. I know that I was a visitor, someone privileged enough to have been given\
  \ access to a place few people get to go so that I could study and bring home with\
  \ me a new perspective. I am not a savior\u2014nobody there needed saving, whether\
  \ or not they lived a different life from me.\n\nIt was not home. But it meant something\
  \ to me, and it still does. I try to keep up with Kenyan news, and I intend to go\
  \ back someday. The megafauna\u2014the giraffes, the elephants, the rhinos and hippos\u2014\
  are under serious threat from both people and climate. People there will be affected\
  \ by climate change, which is something I saw firsthand for the first time. For\
  \ the first time, I saw how the Western method of just throwing money at something\
  \ doesn\u2019t necessarily work. Collaboration\u2014supporting education programs,\
  \ cooperating with local peoples rather than instructing them, bringing people on\
  \ the ground into research projects\u2014is how we can help. Not save, but help.\
  \ \n\nWhen I went to Kenya, I didn\u2019t expect the lessons I learned that weren\u2019\
  t my program courses to be the ones I remembered. I didn\u2019t expect to care so\
  \ deeply about a country I\u2019d never thought about much before. And I did not\
  \ expect to find rain."
