Text: "So my journey started on 6th may last year. It was to the world of the poet\
  \ I always admired, Rabindranath Tagore. Santiniketan, Bolpur is known for the calmness\
  \ that can't be found at the heart of the busy city Kokata where I was born and\
  \ brought up. I choose this destination for my first solo trip ever for two reasons:\
  \ \n1. I always wanted to experience the place in real, the place I have seen through\
  \ the words of poet Tagore.\n2. It's the only place where my parents won't have\
  \ any problem letting me go alone as it's the safest place in Bengal.\nAfter crossing\
  \ the station Bardhaman( a station in between Kolkata and Bolpur), I could sense\
  \ that I am reaching a completely new world of culture as the Bauls(mystic folk\
  \ singers of Bengal) where hopping in the train and giving us a mesmerizing glimpse\
  \ of what's ahead by singing the folk songs. Along with this there was smell of\
  \ \"Jhal-Mudi\" (Street food of Bengal, prepared with puffed rice and spices) giving\
  \ the flavor of pure \"Bangaliana\"(Being traditional Bengali) which can sometimes\
  \ be lost while living in Kolkata with the crowd of different cultures and netflix.\
  \ \nIt was an approx 3 hours journey and felt refreshing instead of tiring with\
  \ all the Baul song and the sceneries of the sides out of the train-window.  My\
  \ arrival was welcomed by friendly local Rickshaw and Toto walas (Rickshaw drivers)\
  \ and one of the Rickshaw-Uncle (driver of local transport Rickshaw) took me to\
  \ my hotel which I booked online. We (me and the unknown Rickshaw driver) planned\
  \ the itinerary of the rest of the day. Yes I planned that with an unknown person\
  \ because people in Santiniketan are that friendly and nice and safe. \nAfter getting\
  \ fresh, my rickshaw-uncle took me to hotel named Ram-Shyam in Sonajhuri gram (village)\
  \ for lunch where I had typical vegetarian thali that made me wonder why I even\
  \ eat non-veg! After that we went to the Sonajhuri Hat (the handcraft fair) that\
  \ itself is a unique experience with all the Sautal dance, baul songs and lots of\
  \ lots of handcrafts shops lied in the whole ground of Sonajhuri Hat. There I made\
  \ friends with the school going kids who were there selling nice handmade dolls\
  \ with the coconut shells, with the bauls who explained me the meaning of life by\
  \ their songs and the Sweet seller who made me have foodgasm by the wonderful taste\
  \ of Rabri(a sweet made of milk). After getting soaked into the flavor of \u201C\
  Rabindrik-Mela\u201D, (The fair of nice arts of every form that resembles the flavor\
  \ of the great poet Rabindranath Tagore) I was taken to the Amar Kutir, a place\
  \ in the bank of river Kopai(The Kopai River). Amar Kutir was a place where once\
  \ the independence movement activists took shelter and now a place for crafting\
  \ arts and selling them to earn money for providing scholarship for the students\
  \ training there. I brought some really nice handmade souvenir at really reasonable\
  \ price. Then went to bank of the Kopai Nodi(River) just before the sun set. I took\
  \ a moment there, as I saw the Sun above in the sky and as well as in the small\
  \ river Kopai, murmuring the poem \u201CAmader choto nodi chole aanke banke, Boishakh\
  \ mashe tar hantu jol thake\u201D,(meaning our little river that runs, has knee\
  \ level water while in the months of Summer)I once read in my childhood. It was\
  \ like a glimpse of my innocent days and just like the picture I imagined while\
  \ reading the poem while I was a kid. \nAs the Sun of sky met the Sun of the river\
  \ Kopai at the horizon, I started the ending of my journey by hopping into the Rikshaw.\
  \ Rikshaw-Uncle introduced his family to me by his enthusiastic words while coming\
  \ back and even invited me to come to his home next day for lunch. But the day came\
  \ to the end as well as my soulful solo trip. Even though I went there alone but\
  \ never was alone as I made new friends who welcomed me in their lives with open\
  \ arms even if it was only for a day!"
