Text: "Everyone says taking risks is part of life, and I was never the type of person\
  \ to do such a thing. I was too afraid of the outcome. It was until I came to a\
  \ certain point in my life, that taking a risk was my only option. I was presented\
  \ with a job opportunity to travel with a business partner. I did not know this\
  \ person but a huge part of me wanted to go. I packed my most important things and\
  \ took my son with me. My friends and family told me I was crazy for doing such\
  \ a thing, considering he was a total stranger.  We began to travel state to state,\
  \ town to town, and city to city. I would be in the car marketing and promoting\
  \ my partners business through my phone. I also helped him numerous times; driving\
  \ late hours across the states. I was thrilled that I was able to see so many different\
  \ scenery and things in each location. I was always that small town girl who never\
  \ left. Months went by and I had already travelled approximately 10 states in a\
  \ matter of 4 months. I began to feel bored and as if I was being used. The only\
  \ thing I benefited from all of this travel was experience. I will forever be grateful\
  \ that I got to see many farm lands, city lights, and things not everyone has the\
  \ chance to experience. I got to see all of this from inside of a car. My business\
  \ partner did not take any time off to admire any beautiful views and picture perfect\
  \ moments. It took four long months to finally realize, that i deserve so much more.\
  \ There is nothing wrong with having high standards and expectations. When two minds\
  \ don\u2019t think alike, that is when things come crashing down like asteroids.\
  \ I expected to get paid for the traveling, marketing and promotions. I didn\u2019\
  t think experience was enough payment for all of that time and effort I put in.\
  \ Am I being selfish? I took away four months of fun and memories from my three\
  \ year old son. I feel guilty for dragging him along, and not having the chance\
  \ to play outside. We were always on the move. There were no days off for my business\
  \ partner. The thing that really stuck with me was seeing him get paid, while me\
  \ and my son were just watching him; wasting away precious time. Is my business\
  \ partner being selfish?  I decided to finally come back to my small town. It was\
  \ a massive challenge considering I was being used like a recycled water bottle.\
  \ Since I was never paid, I had no money to return back to my hometown. Everything\
  \ does happen for a reason and everyone you meet is either a blessing or a lesson.\
  \ My old friend that I\u2019ve known since the 5th grade lived 2 hours away from\
  \ the location I was in. I called her crying my eyes out. I explained how this man\
  \ didn\u2019t want me to leave and I had no way of going back to my hometown which\
  \ was 9 hours away. I took a lyft to her house and from there my mother sent me\
  \ some money from my hometown to take a bus. My mother was in a financial struggle\
  \ just like me; but she still made it happen! Where would I be today, if it wasn\u2019\
  t for my friend, and most importantly my mother?"
