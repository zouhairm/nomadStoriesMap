Text: "On December 31st, I got to the Dominican Republic, my family and I were parking\
  \ the car while I heard a kitten crying, I tried to look for it and found a kitten\
  \ that was about a month old and his mom wasn\u2019t around, so I took him into\
  \ the Airbnb and I named him Felix; I didn\u2019t like cats before rescuing Felix,\
  \ he spent a few days with us at the Airbnb and I used to hide him when someone\
  \ was cleaning the place we were staying at; I fell in love with Felix and I tried\
  \ to find him a home because I was going to travel to the other side of the Dominican\
  \ Republic, from punta cana to Puerto Plata, since I did not find Felix a home,\
  \ I went to see a vet to see if I could bring Felix with me to the USA, the veterinary\
  \ said Felix could not travel to the USA because he was too young and the minimum\
  \ age for cats to be brought to the US is 2 months old. I couldn\u2019t leave Felix\
  \ there because I had a special connection with him, so my mom was traveling from\
  \ Colombia to the DR, to meet with my brothers and me. She did not like cats, but\
  \ after getting to know Felix, she knew that Felix was special and we couldn\u2019\
  t leave him in the DR because he was attached to us and he was a really sweet and\
  \ calm cat. He was the perfect pet for us and we loved him for his personality and\
  \ for how cute he was; he used to sleep with me even though I was allergic to him,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t leave him alone. All my family fell in love with Felix, so my\
  \ mom knew she had to do something so we could either bring Felix to the USA or\
  \ Colombia. My mom talked to the airport agents that were in charge of the transportation\
  \ of animals and she became friends with one of them, so he gave us a vet contact\
  \ to get Felix\u2019s papers so he could leave DR. When my mom and I went to the\
  \ vet, the doctor said he was too young to travel to another country, so I started\
  \ crying hugging Felix and talking to him and my mom saying that I really loved\
  \ him and that I couldn\u2019t leave him behind and that there was something we\
  \ had to do, I couldn\u2019t believe how much love you can feel towards an animal\
  \ and how attached I was to Felix after spending 15 days with him. The vet knew\
  \ that my mom and I were trying to do something good and that we were trying to\
  \ save Felix\u2019s life; so he asked us to go into his office so he could do all\
  \ the papers for Felix\u2019s trip to colombia, he said he wouldn\u2019t take the\
  \ risk of doing all the documentation for Felix to travel to the USA, because he\
  \ could get in trouble. He gave us all the papers and certificates we needed to\
  \ send Felix to Colombia to his new home wich was my mom\u2019s. I had my flight\
  \ to New York a few hours earlier than my mom\u2019s flight to Colombia, so she\
  \ stayed with Felix and we gave him a home. He is getting bigger and he is the cuddliest\
  \ cat I have ever seen in my life, he sleeps with my mom and everyone can see how\
  \ grateful and special he is because he is different. I call Felix my son and he\
  \ is my mom\u2019s grandson, he is the best company my mom could ever ask for, and\
  \ I could say that the money I paid for Felix\u2019s papers, vet and airplane ticket\
  \ has been the best inversion of my life. My trip to the Dominican Republic was\
  \ life changing for my family and me because we found Felix and he found us, we\
  \ couldn\u2019t be more happy with him."
