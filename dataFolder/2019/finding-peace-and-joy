Text: 'This last weekend we had the famous Brazilian carnival. People filling the
  streets, singing and dancing. And for many years I was one of them. However, with
  everything that has been reported, not only in Brazil, but in the whole world, besides
  the fact that we are exhausted from our routines, I accepted my boyfriend''s invitation
  to go camping. That''s right, camping! Who does this at the carnival? We do. Our
  destination was the Santa Teresa National Park in Uruguay. At first, I thought it
  would be a completely different journey, because I didn''t expect to find so much
  peace and joy. I thought it would bother me the fact that we wouldn''t have light
  or water for those days, and yet, the toilets were far from our tents. But, the
  park - very well cared by the army - and the wonderful beaches compensate for everything.
  We spent a few days meeting the park, which is huge! We even got lost on the last
  day trying to find the exit, we had to stop a few times to ask for information.
  But the best thing for me was: no signal on the phones! Just US and nature! Of course
  we took pictures to record the moments, but being able to stay a few days having
  a real connection with people, being present at the moment, leaving the problems
  away. It was fantastic! My first camping experience was complete, we even made a
  campfire. For sure, I can tell you that we''re back much lighter and happier for
  our routines. My tip is: travel! There is a world of experiences to be lived.'
