Text: "\u201CLet me show you a Goddess\u2019s house, and later we\u2019ll drink the\
  \ elixir of god\u2019s,\u201D Shashwat pushes my Americano into my hand, walking\
  \ out of the caf\xE9 with his skinny Latte. I had just arrived in Kathmandu, Nepal\
  \ a day ago and had mentioned seeing history with this stranger, whilst we waited\
  \ for our coffees. \nThe warm air of Kathmandu with its intoxicating and pungent\
  \ smells wash over me as I skip over the obstacle course of broken tiles followed\
  \ by stretches of unbroken pavement, giving me a false confidence of navigating\
  \ unhindered. Kathmandu is myriad of little lanes, all identical, usually with countless\
  \ shrines and temples in each street. \n\u201CWhat\u2019s this goddess\u2019s house?\u201D\
  \ I ask. \u201CIt\u2019s where she lives, and it\u2019s further on,\u201D he points\
  \ vaguely over a white Buddhist stupa under colourful fluttering prayer flags. \u201C\
  Kathmandu was created by gods, they used to live here,\u201D Shashwat starts walking\
  \ down the lane dodging motorcyclists, porters, vendors with carts and cars that\
  \ swerve at the last minute inches from my arm. \u201CDo people still believe in\
  \ all these gods?\u201D I shout over the honking as we stop in front of a \u2018\
  Lassi\u2019 shop. \u201CThis is made of yoghurt,\u201D he hands me a plastic glass,\
  \ \u201COf course we believe in gods, this road is where all the dentists work,\
  \ that is the shrine for the deity that heals teeth,\u201D he points at a wooden\
  \ shrine, lamps burning around it.\n\u201CThe goddess is quintessential to Nepal,\u201D\
  \ he shouts, as we pass a golden temple and hundreds of people on foot, \u201CShakti\
  \ is the immense power of the universe that can only be held by the female form,\
  \ but here in Nepal she\u2019s worshipped in the form of the \u2018Kumari\u2019\
  , the living goddess\u201D. \nI follow, digesting this new information and we enter\
  \ the sweet vendor\u2019s alley, sweets dripping in syrup, huge circular frosted\
  \ fried things, cakes, and other delicious things that I had never seen before.\
  \ We turn the next corner and my stomach churns as I look at my first dismembered\
  \ goat head whose eyes stare back at me balefully, and then I see fish of all shapes\
  \ and sizes, a huge buffalo leg, a side of pork; we are going through the butcher\u2019\
  s lane. \nWe arrive in front of a tiny door that is set in a red-bricked house we\
  \ duck inside the doorway that feels like a place between worlds as the chaos of\
  \ the outside world dissipates. Peering through the gloom I walk through the next\
  \ doorway and enter a courtyard. \u201CWatch the pigeon shit\u201D, Shash warns\
  \ me. I look up to see hundreds of cooing flying birds and the stained walls that\
  \ were a testament to his warning. \nThe courtyard is tiny, full of figurines and\
  \ carvings in the Newari style. \u201CA Malla King in the 15\u2019th century used\
  \ to play dice with a beautiful young woman every day,\u201D he started, \u201C\
  he would forget about his worries of ruling his kingdom, and his wife I suspect,\u201D\
  \ Shash whispered conspiratorially, \u201Dshe advised him and gave him counsel.\
  \ One day filled with lust he made an advance on her. Enraged she revealed herself\
  \ as the deity, \u2018Shakti\u2019, as I explained earlier,\u201D he reminds me.\
  \ \u201CNever again shall I return nor will your kingdom prosper she cursed and\
  \ disappeared,\u201D Shash whispers as we walk around the courtyard with reverent\
  \ tourists like myself. \nWe walk out of this holy place without a glimpse of the\
  \ goddess and into the chaotic and exciting life of Kathmandu, I follow my new friend\
  \ up two flights of stairs and sit opposite him. Two glasses of clear liquid are\
  \ put on the stained wooden tables he continues, \u201CThat King vowed to worship\
  \ her till she forgave him. Over the years he never let up and having sympathy for\
  \ the poor King, \u2018Shakti\u2019 returned, commanding him continue worshipping\
  \ her as she would embody a virgin girl from the Buddhist-Hindu Shakya clan and\
  \ bring prosperity to the nation. Even to this day the president gets blessed by\
  \ this pre-adolescent girl deity.\u201D My new friend picks his glass up, \u201C\
  Now let's drink the elixir of the gods and kings, and to the god within us.\u201D"
