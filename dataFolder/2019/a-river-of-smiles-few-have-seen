  \ Delta,\u201D I tell the driver and press my crumpled reservation into his hands.\
  \ He strip-searches the paper for any navigation clues then pulls out his phone\
  \ for a GPS co-ordinate. We have no common language between us, and I'm hoping that\
  \ our phones will direct us to the lodge's remote location. I peek over the driver\u2019\
  s shoulder for a view of his phone.  There is no pin drop, just a series of lines,\
  \ none of them striking on any destination. Not a good sign.   I remember my daughter's\
  \  parting advice that \" taxi drivers navigate differently in Vietnam, trust them.\u201D\
  \ I silently chant her words. \n\nI searched for an undeveloped tributary of the\
  \ Mekong Delta,  thinking that most tourists would prefer Can Tho, a town that guidebooks\
  \ advise is more comfortable.  I want to find a place on the Mekong that few people\
  \ have seen!\n\n What initially hooks me on the Boutique Lodge listing is its pictures.\
  \ Just six rooms with wooden porches opening onto a garden burdened with fruit and\
  \ flowers. My fingers hover over the reserve button after reading charming descriptions\
  \ like \u201Cbrand new\u201D and \u201Cpeaceful river\u201D and \u201Cfloating markets\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cdinners on request.\u201D When I read that this is a new listing AND\
  \ the only Airbnb on this area of the river, I know this listing is it, and I BOOK\
  \ IT.\n\nNow if only the taxi driver can find our Boutique Lodge which hides somewhere\
  \ between Nhon Nghia and Ba Lang. I offer my phone to the driver after punching\
  \ in the number for Tuan, the host at the lodge with no coordinates.\n\n The driver\
  \ returns my phone, and I assume that he understands Tuan\u2019s navigation.   I\
  \ feel like a trusting passenger again and settle into my seat reassured that my\
  \ daughter's words [trust them] are believable.  I remind myself that my quest for\
  \ a less traveled spot requires patience and belief that the destination will be\
  \ worth the stress of getting there.\n\nWe leave Can Tho bus terminal, turning unto\
  \ the highway. Billboards lining the tarmac road begin to drop from sight. Charcoal\
  \ colored water buffalos stand scattered among green rice fields. All promising\
  \ signs that we are heading into the remote. \n\n After traveling for thirty minutes,\
  \ the driver makes a  hard right turn off a bridge dipping onto a two-scooters-wide\
  \ path, bordered on the right by a murky river. The cab crunches to a stop an arm's\
  \ length from the river bank.  I scan the road to the left for a \u201Cboutique\u201D\
  \ sign. There is none. I sit in the back of the taxi confused.  The driver gets\
  \ out of his seat and motions for us to get out too, which we do. He pops the trunk\
  \ and drops our luggage at the water's edge, waves his hands and makes the noise\
  \ of a boat before driving off. I recite my daughter\u2019s words again, \u201C\
  trust them.\u201D \n\nAfter a breathless wait by the river, whose current carries\
  \ islands of lotuses one direction then another, a boat does show up for a short\
  \ ride to the lodge. Once there we jump into every outing our host, Tuan offers\
  \ like bicycle rides and family-style meals at the river's edge. Each activity adds\
  \ more glimpses of this remote part of the Mekong. \n\nLocal children follow our\
  \ boat from the shore like playful puppies, yelling out greetings, churning from\
  \ side to side, hands thrust in the air. Children dance on lashed pole bridges that\
  \ we hope will hold under their scrambling, shimming feet. Even elders pause from\
  \ chores to smile and greet us. \n\n \nEvery day we stay, we motor the slinky river,\
  \ and the children repeat this scene of smiles and welcome filling me with repeated\
  \ doses of happiness.   I've penned our daily trips as a \"river of smiles.\" \n\
  \nMy time spent at the Boutique Lodge reminds me that being a patient and trusting\
  \ traveler does have its rewards and pledge that \u201Ctrust them\u201D has had\
  \ its pay off in dividends."
