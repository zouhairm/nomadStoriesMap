Text: "I am looking back through the curious eyes of a girl-scout who joined her pack\
  \ in the wilderness of Hunedoara, Romania in the barren summer of 2015.        \
  \                                                     Little did that girl know\
  \ that by aimlessly following her leaders, in the Or\u0103\u015Ftie Mountains, she\
  \ will become aware, years after, of the fact that she can\u2019t live for long,\
  \ away from nature. \u2019The mountains are calling and I must go\u2019-John Muir.\n\
  The journey was brief and seems to have been decades ago.\n Awaiting the day of\
  \ the hike I sat rocking back and forth on the hammock while glancing at the peaceful,\
  \ still scenery of the mountains.                                              \
  \                                     The valley surrounding the dainty cottage\
  \ in Cioclovina- the village that homed our group, placed me high above on the hill,\
  \ with the possibility of glancing across all of it- a perfect spot. \nI remember\
  \ taking it all in, and actually appreciating all that was before me. \u2018This\
  \ sure looks like one hell of a happy place\u2019- I thought to myself at that time.\n\
  \ And indeed, it turned out to be that way for me ,but not because of the landscape\
  \ as much as the experience that laid in the events that were about to follow. The\
  \ same experience that contributed to who I am today.\nIn the morning we woke up\
  \ early and rested, ready to go. The destination was Coste\u015Fti-Blidaru Dacian\
  \ fortress which was, now I realize, a suitable symbol for this self-growth journey,\
  \ my first hike- strength.\n The remains represented the steel roots of the merging\
  \ battle-land of two antagonist cultures that form the Romanian people today: Dacians\
  \ and Romans.\nWe grabbed our backpacks and prepared for a long day of walking and\
  \ a night of sleeping in the woods. The path was steep and I didn\u2019t have the\
  \ best equipment-some second hand, a bit too used trekkers. I could feel my ankle\
  \ juggle at every stepped stone. For the first hours it didn\u2019t feel that bad,\
  \ but then with the path steepening more and lunch hour approaching with its boiling\
  \ rays and suffocating air I started to get weak. We left the protection of the\
  \ shadows cast by trees and started climbing. Hill after hill, after hill...and\
  \ guess what-hill again.\n\u2019Just one more and we\u2019re there\u2019 said our\
  \ leader. What fools to actually believe it at the time, but we couldn\u2019t let\
  \ the darkness of the night approach. We had to reach our goal. \nI was devastated,\
  \ I just had to take a break or I would break down; and I did, the moment we stopped.\
  \ And with all that madness that was going on inside my brain, one thing was clear.\
  \ This was going to make me stronger. We made it to the fortress and we camped through\
  \ the night.\nThe truth is I don\u2019t even recall reaching the destination, but\
  \ I remember the feeling of relief when we arrived. Waves and waves of energy were\
  \ pulsating through my sour muscles. I was nauseous, tired ,but I had never felt\
  \ more alive. \n\u2018Life starts at the end of the comfort zone\u2019 had said\
  \ our leader earlier that day, a great quote. I didn\u2019t listen then, but I know\
  \ now. That\u2019s how my appetite for adventure was created and my excessive tendencies\
  \ made me devour every travel experience that followed.\nBut that specific place\
  \ remains linked to the very core of my passion for travelling, pushing me to achieve\
  \ my goals.\n I didn\u2019t expect to find myself so soon."
