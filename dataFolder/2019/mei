Text: "At the age of 43 I did not know if I should become a parent. The people I surround\
  \ myself with are similar in age and childless. I think we gravitate to each other.\
  \ For the past 22 years, I have traveled the world with them and have immensely\
  \ treasured those moments. Every year, around spring time, we would plan our next\
  \ adventure: Vietnam, China, Central America, the Galapagos Islands; where to next?\
  \  We would each come up with a list of our top three choices and decide from there.\
  \ The anticipation of sitting together and picking our final choice made me feel\
  \ alive.  Those trips defined me and those trips made me free. When I travel I have\
  \ no worries and feel true bliss.  At the age of 43 I did not know if I wanted to\
  \ give this up. Did I have to?\n I did take this leap into the unknown and traveled\
  \ to Wuhan China to get my daughter Mei. I had been to China before, but it was\
  \ through the eyes of a tourist. This was different. This was from the lens of a\
  \ mom, which was still very unclear to me. \n\tI was able to travel to Wuhan, with\
  \ my mother, for two weeks for the adoption. Traveling with my mom and going through\
  \ this experience with her was a gift to me. She is my angel and my comfort. We\
  \ flew into Beijing and then connected to Wuhan. I felt calm yet unsure of what\
  \ I was doing. It was like I was going through the process but not knowing exactly\
  \ what to expect. Who was this little girl who was going to become my daughter?\
  \  She had a name, a story of how she was found, photos of what she looked like\
  \ and countless medial forms, but who was she and how did THEY know she was my daughter?\
  \ It was a joyful confusion for me. \n The city was filled with adjoining rivers,\
  \ bustling commuters, a myriad of museums and government buildings and grand shopping\
  \ centers. Some refer to Wuhan as the \u201CChicago of China,\u201D so I knew we\
  \ would somehow fit in. Pizza Hut was the restaurant we chose to eat during our\
  \ first night. Out of all the tempting and tantalizing food choices out there, we\
  \ chose Pizza Hut. It was American, it was comforting, and it was home. Maybe we\
  \ needed that constant before we stepped into a world of the unknown. \nThe contrast\
  \ of what I experienced next was right out of the pages of a Steinbeck novel: light\
  \ vs. dark. The adoption agency was sterile, dark, and bleak and then in walked\
  \ the light, a burst of pink energy that filled the entire room! Mei, my present\
  \ wrapped in Hello Kitty attire, ran up to me and called me \u201Cmama.\u201D I\
  \ was elated and amazed that this two year old child was mine and already calling\
  \ me what parents are supposed to be called. I still did not identify myself as\
  \ a parent. \nWhat came next was a blend of happiness and chaos. In my true travel\
  \ form, I wanted to see the city and start our adventure, and I jumped right in\
  \ with Mei in hand. We stayed in this beautiful city for one week and then traveled\
  \ to Guangzhou for all the adoption paperwork. The people, the culture, and the\
  \ city all impressed me. What was  most beautiful to see, though, were the families\
  \ who were adopting these children from all over China. Some of these children had\
  \ severe medical needs, but these families took them in as their own. In my mind\
  \ I\u2019ve always separated cultures and that is the intrigue of the quest to see\
  \ these cultures and travel to these distinct lands. In China, these cultures came\
  \ together as one. \nEveryday I step into the unexplored with Mei. Everyday I feel\
  \ the urge to travel and know I can but have more to think about than just myself.\
  \ I want to teach her a love of travel and a love of adventure and do so in a way\
  \ that she will not be scared to become a parent...like I was."
