Text: "Sumba 2018\nFalling in love with it. Frankly speaking i chose the destination\
  \ because of how \u201Chappening\u201D it is inspite of how beautiful it is. \n\
  Didn\u2019t do much research about this destination.\nOnce arrived we were picked\
  \ up by 2 cars, one of it was a double cabin car. We chose to sit in the double\
  \ cabin as it fits the 4 of us. By the end of the 5 days trip we always sit in that\
  \ car privately and the other group of people ln a minibus car fits 16 people (Lucky\
  \ us for paying a group tour but feels like a private tour).\nMangaba Aba Beach,\
  \ Mbawana beach, Ratenggaro Village, Weekuri Lagoon, Laipopu waterfall, Mandorak\
  \ beach, Waimarang waterfall, Wairinding hill, Tenau hill, and savanna, Each left\
  \ a special  place in my heart. \nHow breathtaking the view in Wairinding, Tanau,\
  \ and Tanarara hills, how fresh the Waimarang and Laipopu waterfalls. How green,\
  \ blue, tosca crystal clear all the beaches was. We were amazed and in awe.\nTho\u2019\
  \ to reach one place to another is very far and takes at least 1.5 hr by car. Not\
  \ to mention how steep and hard it was to reach the waterfalls but it all got paid\
  \ once we reach the waterfalls. This place is really not for kids. U need to be\
  \ in a very healthy condition if you want to visit Sumba and see all its beauty.\n\
  \nAlong the trip, we passed by an elementary school kids walked home after school.\
  \ Some of them didnt wear shoes, some of them hold the shoes instead of wearing\
  \ it, some of them wear flops/ sandal. Although they walk kilos to reach school\
  \ and home, back and forth under the sun. \nWe met school age kids around the beaches\
  \ and they asked for money. we\u2019ve prepared some kids magazines, candies and\
  \ second hand clothes to give And when those kids ask for money we gave them things\
  \ that we\u2019ve prepared. Or when we see kids in the traditional village we gave\
  \ them the books and the clothes without them need to ask.\n\nReturn to J-city and\
  \ feel refreshed. Made up our mind to come again to Sumba and explore the most beautiful\
  \ of it."
