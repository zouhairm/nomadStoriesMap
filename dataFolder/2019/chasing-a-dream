Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re not in Europe anymore\u2014you\u2019re in Africa now!\u201D\
  \ our tour guide exclaimed, as the bus full of European and American exchange students\
  \ stood wide-eyed at the windows, pointing at a small group of boys sprinting after\
  \ us as we left the border between Spain (Ceuta) and Morocco behind. In front of\
  \ us, green mountains were all the eye could see. Abdul, native of T\xE9touan, had\
  \ just stepped back on the bus after shooing away the boys, who couldn\u2019t have\
  \ been more than 10 years old, from where they had tried to latch onto the underside\
  \ of our Spanish tour bus. It wasn\u2019t until the end of our trip that we would\
  \ truly understand what he meant by not being \u201Cin Europe anymore.\u201D \n\t\
  There was nothing that could have prepared me for my first visit to a Morocco, where\
  \ the mixture of Muslim and African cultures creates a world so full of color, music,\
  \ and life that feels a million miles away from Europe, even though it is only separated\
  \ by a small stretch of sea. Morocco has always been debated land. Its long history\
  \ of struggle between Arab and European powers resulted in French-speaking cities\
  \ full of European businesses on Arabic-named streets. The Moroccan dialect of Arabic,\
  \ Darija, flies between men, who greet one another with a series of sounds my ear\
  \ is unaccustomed to hear. \n\tWalking along the uneven stones of T\xE9touan\u2019\
  s medina, the old city center, my eyes gravitate to graze the colors of oranges,\
  \ green peas, and pastel powders being sold on the street, while my nose tries to\
  \ catch every whiff of fresh-baked bread from the traditional ovens we pass. But\
  \ it is on faces that my eyes choose to stay. Curiosity emanating from my body,\
  \ I can\u2019t help but stare. Women with faces sunken with age peer out at me from\
  \ their doorways, wicker broom stopped mid-stroke. Men and children graciously return\
  \ my stare, their dark eyes meeting my light blue ones with a mutual curiosity that\
  \ makes it hard for the moment to break. \n\tIt was the children of Morocco who\
  \ fascinated me the most. Rolling an empty can attached to a string, young Moroccan\
  \ boys seemed as though they could make a game out of anything. That\u2019s what\
  \ I attributed the common presence of small sprinters behind our bus throughout\
  \ the duration of the trip to\u2014a peculiar game. The boys would run in packs,\
  \ jumping onto the side or back of the bus two at a time. Then we would pull over,\
  \ and Abdul would pry them off and shake his finger until they walked away, only\
  \ to try their luck once more after the bus was back on its way. I pulled our tour\
  \ guide aside on the last day to ask for answers. What is the purpose of this game?\n\
  \t\u201CIt\u2019s the European dream,\u201D he responded. \u201CIt\u2019s a sad\
  \ reality of Africa, after the long-lasting effects of colonialism, but some boys\
  \ are willing to leave their families and risk their lives to follow that dream.\u201D\
  \n\tI had heard of African immigrants reaching Spain via treacherous rowboats across\
  \ the Strait of Gibraltar, but never of African children immigrating alone as stowaways\
  \ on tour buses. Neither did I believe that it was possible, for a child not to\
  \ be found by authorities as our bus crossed the Moroccan border before being loaded\
  \ onto a ferry in Ceuta. But just outside the city of Seville, Spain, after driving\
  \ 2 hours from the port with a bus full of tired college students, one pair of eyes\
  \ told a story that finally made me believe\u2014those little boys had not been\
  \ playing a game, after all. One small figure sat slumped on the curb, with dirty\
  \ clothes and socked feet. Our driver had just pulled over, due to strange noises\
  \ coming from underneath the bus. Nobody knew for sure how long he had ridden with\
  \ us, hidden in the shadows of machinery while we crossed from one world to another.\
  \ Now, as he sat on European ground, I began to cry, of profound sadness and confused\
  \ happiness for this small, mysterious dreamer. Alone, empty-handed, but free."
