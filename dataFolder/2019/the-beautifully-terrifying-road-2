Text: "It was the first day of my bike trip and I was so excited as I was about to\
  \ embark on a journey that nobody in my family and immediate surrounding had ever\
  \ done or dreamed of doing.\n      I was born and brought up in a small village\
  \ where people never got a chance to travel or they always something more important\
  \ and never got around to it. I was the black sheep of the family, who always wanted\
  \ to go out and explore the world. I had been waiting 20 years for this moment.\n\
  I got an internship in Vietnam and after its completion I had some time where I\
  \ could actually travel the country. I decided to take a 15-day solo bike trip through\
  \ the beautiful mountainous of North Vietnam.\n      I had no idea about the planning,\
  \ efforts and resources required to make it through a bike trip. My knowledge about\
  \ it was limited to the travel blogs that I read, where the travellers made it sound\
  \ so easy. \nIt took me only 6 hours to plan a 15-day trip, which was already a\
  \ bad start. Very few people had done this journey before, because of the sloping,\
  \ curved roads and long hours of travel, but that is what made it thrilling to me.\
  \ These were the unexplored territories with undisturbed natural landscapes and\
  \ views I could only dream of.\n      I set up the Google maps, put on some music,\
  \ and started off my journey easy, with only two hours of travel. I took a wrong\
  \ turn somewhere and reached a resort in middle of nowhere. At 2pm. In the afternoon\
  \ I made an impulse decision to make it to the second location of my trip, which\
  \ was 5 hours away, instead finding the first one.\n      I just kept riding. The\
  \ road I had chosen went through small ethnic villages with a population of not\
  \ more than 20 people each, who did not know my language.\n     The sun began to\
  \ set and my only option to reach the second location, as there were no towns on\
  \ the way where I could stop for the night.\nAs it became darker, I realized that\
  \ I was the only person travelling on that road, with some rough muddy patches and\
  \ no streetlights. \nMy excitement started to turn into distress. At this point\
  \ life decided to be more difficult. I hit a muddy patch where my bike became extremely\
  \ slow and it was difficult for it climb the sloping mountain road. My backpack\
  \ tied to the back of my bike started to slip. I had to use my one hand to hold\
  \ the bag in place, while I drove through the muddy patch by using the other hand.\
  \ \n      There was no light around except that of my bike and the starts sparking\
  \ up in the sky. I could not make any mistakes while riding. If I went a few feet\
  \ to the left, I would fall down the mountain towards my death, and if I drift a\
  \ few feet to the right, I would bang into the mountain.\nI was sure that the first\
  \ day of my travel would end up being the last day of my life. I could not turn\
  \ back as there was nowhere to go, I just had to keep going ahead, slowly and steadily.\
  \  \n      I took a breath of relief, as I saw lights at a distance, after two hours\
  \ of nightmare. I had managed to reach a town, where I found a place to rest for\
  \ the night. I will never forget this day as I had come so close to death, yet managed\
  \ to survive because of my sheer luck. \nI continued my journey the next day, and\
  \ eventually finished my 15day trip. The rest of the days were different as I was\
  \ prepared. I noted all the mistakes I made on the first day, did research, formed\
  \ contingency plans and was ready for almost all emergencies. \n     This trip made\
  \ me a better traveller. Not only did I experience beautiful sceneries but also\
  \ realised that there were many dimensions to travel that a wonderer should always\
  \ anticipate and be prepared for."
