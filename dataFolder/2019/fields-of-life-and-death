Text: "I never thought I\u2019d find myself in the middle of a field planted with\
  \ life and death at the same time. In those days, the heat was so stifling and overwhelming,\
  \ it could transform a four hours horseback ride into a rugged trip to the center\
  \ of the universe, if there is such a thing. \nWe began our journey very early in\
  \ the morning in order to save our skin from receiving the brutal midday sun that\
  \ decides to melt your skin off and cause a terrible dehydration in the mules, all\
  \ of which could delay our journey by a couple of hours more. \n\nAfter the first\
  \ bout of hills and finest ribs of the Sierra Madre Occidental, a collection of\
  \ small slopes and ravines awaited for Lupe my mule, Lorenzo, my team partner, his\
  \ horse and me. We were alone in the middle of the mountains and the silence was\
  \ so sharp that in combination with my fear of heights, made me conjure up the most\
  \ catastrophic scenarios I could imagine. \n\nSome people had warned me that it\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be an easy project, that it demanded the possession of a long list\
  \ of human skills including personal development and adaptability, so I took the\
  \ challenge. I desperately wanted to learn about the indigenous communities nestled\
  \ in the throat of the immensity, but even more, I wanted to understand my own spirit.\n\
  \ \nAs Lorenzo implored me to keep my eyes open and hold Lupe on track, so we could\
  \ overcome the hilly terrain, the deafening silence dissipated and I began to hear\
  \ small repetitive sounds which, given the morphology of the landscape, caused a\
  \ clunking echo that bounced into the mountains walls. \n\nA low tick, tick, tick\
  \ sound grew stronger as we left the rugged landscape, and our eyes fell on a field\
  \ of giant green stems in uniformed rows. Some of the stems opened up exposing tiny\
  \ little blossoms that, in some cases, dared to revealing a shy glimpse of delicate\
  \ pink petals. As we moved into the field that seemed endless, I could realize that\
  \ the tick, tick, tick sound came from the elaborate irrigation systems and distribution\
  \ channels used for watering the giant poppy plantation, a prohibited crop in Mexico.\
  \ For a moment, I thought I was in the Netherlands and not in the middle of the\
  \ incredibly poor Mexican mountain ranges void of infrastructure.\n\nShocked and\
  \ a little dizzy due to the altitude and sight that was before us, I turned back\
  \ to confirm that not only was Lorenzo still there and that we were following the\
  \ right path, but that he was also seeing  the same surreal landscape as I had been.\
  \ \n\nShock ran through me, being from the city, I did not have a good grasp on\
  \ the harsh and severe realities of the countryside in one of the most poverty-stricken\
  \ states affected by governmental indifference and discrimination.\n\n\u2014Come\
  \ on, keep on moving\u2014  said Lorenzo, who was born in those mountains.  \nHe\
  \ exchanged a kind hello with a man who, with the help of an AK-47 guarded the fields\
  \ of poppies.\n\n\u2014Morning Artemio, it\u2019s really hot today right? \u2014\
  \ Lorenzo said. The man nodded in agreeance.\n \nI was stunned and pretty scared.\
  \ Each and every single one of the Artemios, who were camouflaged among the crops,\
  \ held a gun and their faces were covered with hardness and contempt with our presence.\
  \ \n\nI tried to quicken Lupe's step to get out of that scene as fast as I possibly\
  \ could. After leaving the guarded camp, I looked to Lorenzo's eyes hoping to find\
  \ some answers to my questions, but he showed no interest in talking about it. Some\
  \ questions are better left unasked.\n\nIn the late afternoon we reached the top\
  \ of the mountain, our backs destroyed and bathed in sweat. We had climbed about\
  \ 400 meters, there were no toilets, no running water, and the minimal street lighting\
  \ was a simple collection of six posts dispersed amongst a few houses that were\
  \ interspersed amid sparse bushes. In the distance, little lights appeared isolated\
  \ from the industrial crops where the poppy gum is waiting to be harvested, but\
  \ here on top, there was hardly any light."
