Text: "Less than an hour before my flight, my grandparents called and begged me not\
  \ to go. \n\n\"This is how people die,\" they said. \"Your career isn't worth your\
  \ life.\" \n\nIt was 2014, the year of Operation Edge and the Gaza War. I was sitting\
  \ at an empty terminal awaiting an El-Al flight that would take me to Israel, where\
  \ I would spend the next three months as a conflict journalism intern in the centre\
  \ of it all. \n\nI'd been packed for months, my suitcase a meticulous smattering\
  \ of Mickey Mouse stickers accumulated over time and various comic book characters\
  \ to ensure that nobody - and I mean nobody - would dare attempt to steal a piece\
  \ of luggage so embarrassingly conspicuous. \n\nThe death count in the Middle East\
  \ was rising day after day, entire cities that I'd spent so much of my childhood\
  \ carelessly running through levelled and decimated by rocket and missile debris.\
  \ Why go at all? It was a question I'd been asking myself since I laid eyes on the\
  \ application form almost a year ago. I wasn't sure. \n\n\"Not me,\" I told them,\
  \ blinking back uncertain tears. I never told them this, but I'd voluntarily signed\
  \ four different life release forms that morning, exonerating Tazpit News Agency\
  \ from all responsibility in the event of my death. \"This is not how I die.\" \n\
  \nIn my previous travels, I was greeted by warm (if not overly wide and authoritatively\
  \ overbearing) smiles from helpful stewardesses. Someone offering to help me find\
  \ my seat. A complicated mess of human beings, all rife with frustration amidst\
  \ their common quest to sit down in the right places. As I walked onto the empty\
  \ plane, a stewardess began to shake her head. My grandmother began to cry on the\
  \ phone. I was immediately offered alcohol.\n\nA new adventure. A change of scenery.\
  \ A chance to truly learn something new. These were all things I craved, but my\
  \ grandmother had a point: I could do that without walking into an open war zone.\
  \ Alone on a sombre plane ride, this could be how I die. \n\nEven today, I think\
  \ about how I felt then every once in awhile. I remember the fear. Just for a moment,\
  \ I welcome the small flood of panic. I harness it now.  I remember a time when\
  \ I wanted to explore more than I wanted to breathe. \n\nI remember the first time\
  \ I heard a rocket. \n\nI'd been in Israel for a grand total of one hour. My ears\
  \ won't stop ringing. A woman in an Israeli military jacket calmly barks orders.\
  \ \"No need to panic, shelter can be found downstairs,\" she says. Somewhere, miles\
  \ and miles above, I hear a loud crack. The words \"Tzevah Adom\" blare on foreign\
  \ loudspeakers, playing over and over again and again, a whirlwind of chaos and\
  \ people fleeing for their lives. \n\nA woman with two children grabs me by the\
  \ arm and points in the direction of the airport's bomb shelter. In her best english,\
  \ she makes out a single word. \"Run.\" \n\nThis is not how I die, I thought. My\
  \ legs are moving faster than my mind process. This is not how I die. I shout \"\
  thank you\" in my best hebrew. This is how I live."
