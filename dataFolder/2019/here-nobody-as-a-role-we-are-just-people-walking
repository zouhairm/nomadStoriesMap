Text: "I leave Puente la Reina at the crack of dawn. Walking alone at night it\u2019\
  s always a little frightening. \nStep by step, foot after foot, I lose my sense\
  \ of direction, I can\u2019t seem to find the yellow arrow that leads the way along\
  \ The Camino marking the route.\nAfter the initial moments of panic, its already\
  \ 6.30am and the first lights of sun start to show. \nSince I\u2019ve been on The\
  \ Way I swear I\u2019ve witnessed the most wonderful, colourful, breath-taking sunrises\
  \ and today is no less. \nThe sky has this collection of colours all melting together,\
  \ brilliant orange, bright pink mixing in with yellow, all swirling in together\
  \ breaking-up the deeper shades of blue from the previous hours. \n\nMy goal today\
  \ is to walk 35 km until Villamayor, after 24km I stop at Estella to get some needed\
  \ food.\nI\u2019m impressed by how crowded the streets are. Estella is a little\
  \ medieval town characterized by Roman and Gothic constructions, music is blasting\
  \ from the streets and everyone is dressed with white clothes and a red scarf tied\
  \ up on their hips. The kids are screaming and swimming in the river, the more I\
  \ look around, the more I have these feelings of joy and calm\u2026 I feel alive.\n\
  After talking with some locals, I start walking again. The heat is almost unbearable,\
  \ thank god for the fountains along the way.\n\nOnce arrived at my destination I\
  \ search for a place to pass the night. The hostel is run by a tall, blond and light\
  \ blue-eyed man, he looks like a \"Holy man\" with its white linen shirt and those\
  \ kind manners.\nWhen he looks at me it\u2019s like he is looking right into my\
  \ soul.\nWe eat together, pilgrims and volunteers from the hostel, a delicious Mexican\
  \ dinner cooked by an elderly Dutch gentleman, also a volunteer at the hostel with\
  \ his wife. \nWe go around introducing ourselves and explaining why we're here,\
  \ even though I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m there. \nI know I\u2019m searching\
  \ for something, but what?\nIt seems to me to have gone back in time during my Erasmus\
  \ year when, different cultures and languages came together and you had the opportunity\
  \ to learn the habits and customs of others having the desire to find out who were\
  \ the people sitting at the table next to you. \n\nAfter dinner the \"Holy man\"\
  \ makes a speech to make us understand, according to him, what is the meaning behind\
  \ The Camino and wish us all a good trip <<Buen Camino peregrinos, Ultreya et Suseya!>>.\
  \ \nHe invites us to take part to a moment of meditation in a special room created\
  \ just for that. I have never been able to meditate but, perhaps I have never really\
  \ tried. \nGoing inside the room - you have to bent down to enter and move around\
  \ -, it looks like a cave: large carpets cover the floor and the walls are hidden\
  \ by large sheets, relaxing music can be heard in the background.\nWe all sit on\
  \ the floor; an English girl starts reading a chapter from the Bible and asks everyone\
  \ to close their eyes. \nThe experience was beautiful, especially the moment of\
  \ sharing in which, those who felt like it, could express any thoughts or feelings.\
  \ People took turns to talk, something I\u2019ve never experienced before, It was\
  \ overwhelming to say at least. I remember this boy, he could be around 19 years\
  \ old. \nHe lost his parents a couple of months before starting The Camino, he looked\
  \ so lost. He didn\u2019t know what to do with his life, he said crying << I lost\
  \ everything, I don\u2019t have anything anymore>>. It broke my heart. \n\nHere\
  \ I understood something i din't expect, El Camino de Santiago is kind of like the\
  \ real life, it challenges you daily. \nAnd I do not mean just with a physical pain,\
  \ but also a mental fatigue. Disappointments, moments of happiness and sadness,\
  \ nostalgia\u2026 But in spite of everything, you continue to walk, learning to\
  \ listen to your body and more than anything else, your mind. \nBecause in the end,\
  \ The Camino, is above all a union between people, souls and cultures."
