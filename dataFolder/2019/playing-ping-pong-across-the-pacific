Text: "On one sweltering February day in the Amazon a couple years ago, a door shut.\
  \ Slammed. In my face. Plans were suddenly terminated. Dreams crushed. My calendar\
  \ opened and my mind, released from its cage, wandered nervously. Frantically. Searching\
  \ for purpose and placement. There I was, for the first time in a long time, feeling\
  \ totally open to the moment. Perched precariously on a point, feeling as though\
  \ I could fall in any direction. It was disorienting, terrifying, and...exciting.\
  \ Compass spinning, and I was dizzy, grinning.  \nI heard from a chance encounter\
  \ that this was the end of hurricane season, and a flock of sailboats would soon\
  \ set sail from Panama to cross the Pacific Ocean. By the end of our conversation\
  \ I felt my compass had landed. I was going to join them. Somehow. I didn\u2019\
  t know how to sail, and I didn\u2019t know much about the Pacific at all. I had\
  \ no idea how long it would take to cross, and if I had, I wouldn\u2019t have been\
  \ able to fathom it. But that is what I was going to do - sail from Panama to New\
  \ Zealand. \nTwo days later I kissed Peru goodbye and leapt into the unknown. Once\
  \ in Panama City, I found my way to the marina. I walked the docks looking for sun\
  \ cooked skin and bleached t-shirts. It was tricky to talk to people because most\
  \ of the boats were moored out in the water. All I could do was wait around from\
  \ rock to dock, as a lonely sun brittled land crab. \nAs the day was growing old\
  \ a light footed man walked down the dock towards me. He had striking blue eyes\
  \ and a promising sun tan. \u201CAre you sailing across the Pacific?\u201D I asked.\
  \ \u201CTrying to...\u201D he winced with a humoured, pained expression. \u201C\
  Can I join?\u201D I asked, with nothing to lose. \n\u201CYou know how to sail?\u201D\
  \ he prodded. \u201CHaven\u2019t got a clue,\u201D I said with a smirk. \u201CYou\
  \ must be crazy then\u201D he threw back, eyes lively. \u201CI am crazy. And I\u2019\
  ve got nothing better to do.\u201D I said. \u201CThat is exactly what I am looking\
  \ for in my crew.\u201D he said, a smile growing on his face. We clasped hands and\
  \ then he paddled me aboard his boat and showed me around. I was in love. It was\
  \ an old Vagabond.  A perfect pirate ship. He had a globe, a big library, a bicycle,\
  \ a surf board and fishing rods. Everything a little worse for wear. Rough and ready.\
  \ What a life. Luckily for me, a few things on the boat broke on his first attempt\
  \ across, forcing him to return to Panama. His crew bailed and he was left in the\
  \ lurch. We hit it off. He still wanted one other crew member, which we found through\
  \ a website. Two days after arriving in Panama I was helping to provision a boat\
  \ for myself and two strangers. Unless things went wrong, the first leg of the trip\
  \ would be 40 or so days until we would make our first landing in Hiva Oa. On my\
  \ third day in Panama passports were stamped, anchor yanked and sails hoisted. No\
  \ concessions were made - I had to learn quickly. Had to learn how weather works,\
  \ how to spot a storm coming our way, to navigate, to repair sails and change them\
  \ to match the wind, to keep myself entertained when we were stuck in the doldrums,\
  \ how to catch, kill, clean and cook fish. Two hundred and twenty ways to eat rice\
  \ and fish. I learned how to live in a tiny moving space with two strangers. But\
  \ above all, I learned how amazing life can be when you leap into the unknown. I\
  \ saw stars I never dreamed of, dolphins glowing bright green in the bioluminescence\
  \ like shooting comets, whales, sharks, dolphins, turtles, flying fish, swallows\
  \ and storms. We finally made it to Hiva Oa in 42 days. And then we continued voyaging\
  \ until we made it to New Zealand nine and a half months after leaving Panama. I\
  \ will never again be scared of a door closing. Because as they say, a new door\
  \ always opens."
