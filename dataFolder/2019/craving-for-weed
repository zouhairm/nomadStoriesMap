Text: "The view of striking lightning and dark-grey cumulonimbus clouds were the only\
  \ scene my eyes could catch. A sudden sound of crackling thunder rumbled down. The\
  \ entire Teluk Awur was surrounded by fright.\n\n\u201CYou better pray \u2026 and\
  \ mean it!\u201D\n\nI\u2019ve never thought those words screamed out from Hadi \u2013\
  a brave muscular fisherman who happened to be my guide\u2013 while his hands kept\
  \ holding up boat engine that hideously roared. \n\nAs a matter of fact, I couldn\u2019\
  t think of anything else as my thought was wiped by 2 meters-massive tide standing\
  \ in front of our wooden fishing vessel while it was poured with non-stopping hard\
  \ rain. \n\nA vessel in the middle of raging ocean seems like a dwarf to a giant.\
  \ \n\nMy heart was torn apart between dodging the sea, going back to shore \u2013\
  and praying in the process\u2013 or swimming into the wrathful sea, getting the\
  \ weed I have been canvasing for months. With my own life at stake.\n\nThe middle\
  \ of sunny June was seemingly a perfect time to wander around Teluk Awur coast in\
  \ Jepara, known for its most abundant naturally grown seaweed in Java island. No\
  \ horrible rain or murderous storm was foreseen. With a container in the trunk full\
  \ of life jackets, snorkels, fins and light meter, seaweed collection was about\
  \ to embark. \n\nApproaching some locals to be my guide was next thing I did the\
  \ moment I arrived at the beach. That\u2019s when Hadi showed up with his testimony\
  \ about how he has attempted to restrict seaweed exploitation. Functioning as anti-oxidant,\
  \ anti-obesity and gelling agent, more and more industries are attracted to grab\
  \ them. \n\nStaring at the island far ahead across where we stood, frustratedly\
  \ he said \u201CBut those ridiculously-rich people have to know their limit. Seaweeds\
  \ are there as filter for waste from the surroundings.\u201D \n\nYet, the amount\
  \ I would take was nothing. \n\nCollecting seaweeds is not without challenge. Rocky\
  \ coast of Madura 7-years back was a witness how I \u2013wasn\u2019t able to swim\
  \ at the moment nor did I have proper equipment\u2013 struggled to not to get drowned\
  \ in water with a help of single floating bucket, which was supposedly used as container.\
  \ \n\nNow, equipped with snorkels and life jackets did not eliminate any problems\
  \ as the weather suddenly changed without anyone could predict, not even by experienced\
  \ fishermen or the weather forecast. That fine breezy morning switched to tense\
  \ atmosphere in just a second.\n\nNo other choice. As I have chosen a life being\
  \ as researcher, that\u2019s when I also signed an imaginary contract to be part\
  \ of nature. No matter how it might turn to be.\n\nWhen all of a sudden, heavy-windy\
  \ rain became drizzle and rolling tide shifted to calming wave, I found myself in\
  \ the water \u2013with banana smile on my face\u2013 encircled by numerous seaweeds\
  \ on my sight."
