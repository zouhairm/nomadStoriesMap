Text: "Leap of Faith \n\nThere was a clinking of metal as he pulled the straps and\
  \ buckles tighter between my legs; my heart hammered painfully in my chest with\
  \ anticipation. No, I wasn\u2019t participating in some terrifying bondage event,\
  \ although that probably still would have been more in my comfort zone than the\
  \ current situation. \n\nWhy couldn\u2019t I have dealt with a soul-destroying break-up\
  \ like a normal person; by sobbing into a family sized tub of Ben and Jerry\u2019\
  s while stagnating in front of Netflix for a few weeks? Yet here I was, dressed\
  \ in a giant red onesie, strapped to a stranger, about to be pushed out of a plane,\
  \ with only 15,000 feet between myself and the mountainous landscape below. \n\n\
  New Zealand was always somewhere I\u2019d wanted to go but had never had the courage.\
  \ After all, I\u2019d thought - isn\u2019t New Zealand for adrenaline junkies and\
  \ thrill seekers? But after endless night of sobbing, convinced that I wasn\u2019\
  t brave enough to Go It Alone, I had decided to finally take the leap; I just hadn\u2019\
  t anticipated it being so literal. \n\nThe town of Wanaka on New Zealand\u2019s\
  \ South Island had beckoned me with its snow tipped mountains and mirror-like alpine\
  \ lakes, but right then I couldn\u2019t focus for long enough to appreciate the\
  \ view. As I peeked out of the window of the tiny plane, anxiety fizzed in my chest\
  \ like a shaken-up cola can. Then the moment finally came. Strapped together, my\
  \ buddy and I did an awkward synchronised bum-shuffle toward the plane hatch, open\
  \ wide onto the sprawling (but stomach-dropping) views of glacial carved valleys\
  \ below. My knuckles were white and shaking as I gripped onto my shoulder straps,\
  \ trying to remember my safety briefing back at the bunker, to hold on tight throughout\
  \ the free-fall until my skydiving-buddy tapped my shoulder, the signal to let go\
  \ after the parachute opened. \n\nThen we fell. Tumbling through the clouds. My\
  \ stomach lurched to catch up with my body. Adrenaline sparked through my veins\
  \ as I plummeted face-down toward the earth at 200KMH. Colours splattered across\
  \ my vision; familiar images from bizarre angles, like an abstract painting. Yet,\
  \ despite the deafening rush of wind I was blissful, calm, clear. I didn\u2019t\
  \ have any control over my fate and it felt exhilarating. \n\nSuddenly, my whole\
  \ body jolted as the parachute thrust us to a brief halt in mid-air, the tumble\
  \ dryer effect ceased, and the rush of the wind was silenced. My buddy loosened\
  \ our harness for comfort and kept his promise; he tapped me on the shoulder to\
  \ signal that it was time to let go, let go of my harness and let go of all of all\
  \ of my nerves, my anxiety, my resentment; they shot up into the air with my parachute,\
  \ left far behind in the clouds. \n\nI threw my arms out wide in a Redeemer-like\
  \ pose as we floated gently over the yellow, brown and green patchwork quilt of\
  \ farm and fields. A winding river snaked through lush green valleys until it met\
  \ with the milky blue of Lake Wanaka, which welcomed me with a cheeky twinkle of\
  \ sunshine as we glided across bright blue sky. My cheeks were flapping unattractively\
  \ but I couldn\u2019t help but smile, bursting with pride at having just had the\
  \ courage to leap towards my new life."
