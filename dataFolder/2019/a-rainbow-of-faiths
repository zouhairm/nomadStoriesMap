Text: "It is early morning. I can feel the pink light of the dawn on my face, knocking\
  \ on my closed eyelids. Around me, the usual voices of the most peculiar birds,\
  \ the sounds of the leaves and the branches slinking with the wind. I will try to\
  \ keep my eyes closed a little bit longer, but I know that soon the excitement of\
  \ all the beauty I will see around me will tempt me enough to make me surrender.\
  \ It is my favourite part of the day when just the early birds are up. And here\
  \ it is so easy to wake up the right time! I have no walls around me and the floor\
  \ where I am sleeping is so high that I can easily wake up with the earliest lights\
  \ of the day when the sky starts to turn light blue, before the sun brings the warm\
  \ colors in. At that time of the day, the birds start to sing.\n\nSo that\u2019\
  s how I wake up. I just have to get out of the bed, climb one more floor, and here\
  \ I am, at the same heights of the top of the eucalyptus trees. The structure is\
  \ completely made out of wood. Seven floors. We all sleep together in the fifth\
  \ one, the purple one. It is probably around 10 of us but I rarely hear a sound\
  \ at night. We are disposed in a circle, but the wind and the sounds of the forest\
  \ are all I can hear. I am in The Rainbow Temple of Whatever. Yes, you heard me\
  \ right, \"of Whatever\" is part of the official name. \n\nDon\u2019t come if you\
  \ just want a cheap place to sleep though. After my morning meditation, I start\
  \ working. Usual duties (weeding and sweeping dry leaves) and anything else I feel\
  \ like doing: cleaning, cooking. My favourite one is getting rid of cobwebs. Here\
  \ in Australia most of people can\u2019t be bothered with taking the cobwebs away.\
  \ The following day they will be there again, they say. As if the dry leaves were\
  \ not, but Australians do always swipe those away. Considering how dangerous some\
  \ spiders can be here, I would try to contain their vital space, to be honest. But\
  \ around here having a deadly spider on your doorstep is not really a problem. Really!\
  \ It is not!  There is space for everyone after all, and you cannot really avoid\
  \ dangerous or deadly creatures over here, so you\u2019d better be at peace with\
  \ it! \n\nBack to the Rainbow Temple of Whatever. Guy - the founder of the project\
  \ - started building it 35 years ago. When I asked him why he replied: \u201CI had\
  \ bought a piece of land and built a house, but it was not in the right spot, so\
  \ I wanted to build a new one, and then I thought: I\u2019d better build a temple!\
  \ But not a regular one: a temple with no religion\u201D And that was his explanation.\
  \ And since he was building this seven-floor wooden structure, he decided also to\
  \ dig a tunnel under (why this time I did not ask), which is few meters long and\
  \ in total darkness apart from the star-like lights of the glowing worms who found\
  \ in it a great shelter for their incubation period. \n\nWe are still in New South\
  \ West of Australia, though at the border with Queenstown, close to Byron Bay, a\
  \ once-upon-a-time hippy place now famous destinations of surfers and backpackers\
  \ (and it takes the name from the grandfather of the poet Lord Byron, in case you\
  \ wonder).  Here, even the soil is something special. The town and the surrounding\
  \ area lay on land produced by the erosion of an ancient volcano, which has nowadays\
  \ become black obsidian. It is for this reason, they say, that the hippy community\
  \ of the \u201870s was so much attracted by the energy of this place. \n\nNow I\
  \ am not particularly into crystals, but I felt so blessed and refreshed all the\
  \ time I was here. And I could tell you more, about the Crystal Castle and the other\
  \ hippie communities around...but you\u2019d better come and see it yourself. It\
  \ is too magic to describe!"
