Text: "Pushkar Fair \u2013 The Call Of The Dessert\n\n\u201CYou should not see the\
  \ desert simply as some faraway place of little rain. There are many forms of thirst\u201D\
  \u2013 William Langewiesche \n\nAs the American author states no desert is only\
  \ a location of scanty rains, it is much more, Pushkar seems to fit into his observation\
  \ just perfect. \nThe annual Pushkar Camel Fair is one trip that lingers long.\n\
  Pushkar Mela as called by locals, over years has turned into an annual celebration\
  \ of desert life with travellers coming from the world over. \nThe ardent travellers\
  \ gather at the banks of Pushkar Lake to get fascinated by the sights, sounds and\
  \ the spirit of the people particularly the herders of Rajasthan who throng to Pushkar\
  \ every year with their livestock, mainly camels and also horses, sheep for sale.\
  \ \n\nOn the road to Pushkar, as soon as you see the multitude of livestock from\
  \ far you also realize that you are at the annual and largest animal trading fair\
  \ of India. The sheer energy, the costumes, colours are just so amazing! The coming\
  \ together of the intricate detail in their apparel design with the magical spirit\
  \ of the desert, everything seems beautifully synchronized. Over years Pushkar has\
  \ transformed into a carnival of sorts with animal trade, musical concerts and cultural\
  \ programming.\n\nWe had arrived at Pushkar, geared and excited to explore! At heart,\
  \ we were open and prepared to cherish and celebrate an eclectic mix of tradition\
  \ and the cool vibes, that co-exists seamlessly at this festival. The town of Pushkar\
  \ is centred around Push Lake nested among world`s oldest residual mountains. The\
  \ lake is of theological importance and is said to be one of the 5 destinations\
  \ a Hindu may take a pilgrimage to. A spiritual experience is conveyed by the ambience\
  \ on the banks of the lake, a quiet early morning is suggested to delve into this\
  \ mood. The place also hosts one of the few temples exclusively dedicated to God\
  \ Brahma- the universal creator depicted in hindu mythology.\n\nStrolling is what\
  \ I did, savouring the local. The winding alleys of this quintessential Rajasthani\
  \ town are absolutely fascinating with surprises waiting to entice you. The local\
  \ tea shops are great places to observe interesting characters while the actual\
  \ animal trading site resembles a scene from a period film. Here locals are ever\
  \ smiling, men with sturdy and weathered faces but a warm spark in their eyes and\
  \ women coyly smiling, dressed in ethnic wears, jewellery, looking their radiant\
  \ best. Even the camels are decorated beyond comprehension with silver ornaments\
  \ specially designed for them. \n\nEvenings of the festival are best spent at a\
  \ musical concert, at least that's what I did, the ones that were led by the folk\
  \ musicians were soul food. Over years I have realised that Rajasthani folk music\
  \ always manages to leave its audience mesmerized. If you aren`t a music person\
  \ go ahead and participate in cultural activities packed day long to keep the travellers\
  \ engaged.\n\nFood isn`t a worry in Pushkar. Savour global vegetarian food. Let\
  \ your taste buds revel the taste of momos and noodles of Tibet, the Italian Pizza\u2019\
  s, the falafel of Israel and of course Indian quintessential snacks, the ever tantalising\
  \ range with the dependable chai. \n\nWell sounds hectic! When tired go for a session\
  \ of reflexology or reiki interestingly easily available.\nAny chance to avoid shopping\
  \ in Pushkar. None! One will end up buying memorabilia, trinkets, wall hangings\
  \ and what not. I did. \nPushkar and photography have become synonymous for a generation\
  \ which spends many hours on Instagram, Facebook and the likes. As someone who is\
  \ not always eager to click the endless photographs, I must candidly admit, I kept\
  \ pressing the shutter much to my own surprise.\n\nFact File \u2013 Getting there\
