Text: "Grey clouds linger in the sky as rain drops cover the window of my Airbnb.\
  \ Staying in a high rise, tech savvy apartment in the middle of Seoul was definitely\
  \ a stark contrast to the small charming apartment my friend Veralice and I temporarily\
  \ inhabited in the outskirts of Tokyo, where daisies thrived under predominantly\
  \ clear blue skies. \n\nUpon departure from Incheon International en route to our\
  \ Airbnb, I immediately felt an environmental energy shift. This sensation was unlike\
  \ the shift I experienced when Veralice and I landed at Haneda, a few days prior.\
  \ The best way to describe that feeling would probably be a mixture of awe and,\
  \ in a way, fear of the unknown. \n\nThese conflicting feelings continued to internally\
  \ broil until dusk, which was when Veralice had wanted to go on an impromptu trip\
  \ to Hongdae, a neighborhood in Seoul that is bustling with young adults indulging\
  \ in activities that are much more enjoyable when the Sun goes down. \n\nVeralice\
  \ and I stroll down the wet pavement, and to our left, there were three separate\
  \ crowds of young adults that were lined by the road, performing a rendition of\
  \ a K-Pop song of their choice. To our right, were lively restaurants and bars teeming\
  \ with people. On the other side of the street were other restaurants and bars,\
  \ as well as a couple of clubs. \n\nIn the midst of all this, I somehow lose my\
  \ friend. I didn't that we had been separated nor did I notice that I was in the\
  \ middle of a crowd of people. Unable to process what had just happened, I stood\
  \ in the middle of the sidewalk and internally panicked as the feeling of not knowing\
  \ where to go or what to do became my only thought. Not too long after, I felt a\
  \ gentle tug on my arm and immediately notice that Veralice had linked our arms\
  \ together. \n\nThe next thirty minutes felt like an eternity as exhaustion started\
  \ settling in. Thankfully, Veralice suggested that we should head back to our Airbnb.\
  \ That same night and for the remainder of our time, I reflected on my behaviours\
  \ from that night in Hongdae. \n\nUp until that moment, I had believed that I was\
  \ an easily adaptable person who thrived in loud environments, but I was wrong.\
  \ It was for this reason, that I understood why I was so at ease in the outskirts\
  \ of Tokyo and less so in the middle of Seoul."
