Text: "Small sharp rocks are digging into the soles of my feet.  Nervously, I inch\
  \ closer to the edge and peer down.  Not liking what I see, I cover my eyes with\
  \ my hands.  I take a few deep breaths, trying to calm myself down, but to no avail.\
  \  Instead, I\u2019m on the verge of tears.  What was I thinking when I agreed to\
  \ this reckless activity? \n\nI\u2019m on the island of Milos, at Sarakiniko beach,\
  \ in early October.  Milos probably isn\u2019t the island you\u2019d think of when\
  \ someone tells you they\u2019re heading to the Cyclades.  You\u2019d most likely\
  \ think of either Santorini or Mykonos first.  When I decided to visit Greece, Milos\
  \ wasn\u2019t even on my radar.  Now it is my favourite island.\n\nSarakiniko is\
  \ a beautiful contrast of gemstone blue waters and smooth white volcanic rocks.\
  \  I\u2019ve never seen a beach like this before.  Today, the sea is completely\
  \ ours, probably due to how windy it is.  Water blends into sky and I feel like\
  \ I\u2019m staring into eternity.  Actually, I\u2019ve been up at the top of this\
  \ cliff for about an eternity.  My one friend has already completed the jump and\
  \ is now sitting on the shore.  He shouts some encouraging words at me.  My second\
  \ friend is berating me from the water.  The third is at the cliff\u2019s edge with\
  \ me.  He asks, clearly annoyed, \u201CShould I push you in?\u201D  No.  That idea\
  \ seems even more dangerous than just jumping.\n\nThe reason why I\u2019m in this\
  \ mess is because today is my friend\u2019s birthday.  Yesterday he declared, \u201C\
  The only birthday gift I want is for all of us to go cliff jumping tomorrow.\u201D\
  \  Of course, the other two were instantly game.  I was not, yet here I am.  All\
  \ of this is happening because I decided to be a good friend.  What a terrible decision.\n\
  \nI\u2019m stuck at the top of this cliff not because I am afraid of heights, but\
  \ because I am terrified of the sea.  I don\u2019t know how to read the water. \
  \ I am not a strong swimmer.  I am not a fan of the many slimy things that reside\
  \ below the surface, not to mention all the things that could eat me.  On top of\
  \ it all, today, the water is choppy.  What if I don\u2019t jump far enough out\
  \ and land on rocks?  Some of my fears are rational, some of them probably are not.\n\
  \nAfter being bombarded with advice, yelled at, gently encouraged, and then threatened,\
  \ I jump.  I jump, eyes closed, and in complete silence.  I am in shock.  My toes\
  \ break through the surface and my body follows.  When I emerge, I scream.  Then\
  \ I curse a few times.  My friend helps me back to shore.\n\nI jump another three\
  \ times before we leave, shrieking with delight each time."
