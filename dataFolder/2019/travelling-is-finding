Text: "From the glitz of Dubai to the beer in a shady place on the Asian side of Istanbul;\
  \ from the dearest greens of Julian Alpes to the thrilling blues and whites of Greeks\
  \ islands - what has made the most lasting resonance in my memory? What was it that\
  \ pushed me into nights and days of travels, often at the expense of a more lasting\
  \ thing I could have had instead? What was it that made me count and then describe\
  \ all my visits to Slovenia or Rome, and changing me(s) in them? They are nice memories,\
  \ that\u2019s sure. It\u2019s enthralling to win a competition and then visit New\
  \ York and encounter so-many-almost-all of your pop cultural references. It\u2019\
  s lovely on a rainy spring night in Lisbon, and it\u2019s even better when you go\
  \ to a place with the people closes to your heart. Then, there are sometimes captivating\
  \ photos you somehow make in all of it, although you are not a photographer.\nBut\
  \ there is this thing that applies to all trips, both easy and complicated ones,\
  \ long or short, those that lived up to expectations or not. And it is the fact\
  \ that I can write about them. Right after the trip, or years later. For a blog,\
  \ newspaper, or to a friend. It is through writing that a window opens that makes\
  \ connections in my heart and mind. This trip, and that one. This distant memory,\
  \ and then another, that suddenly belong together. That Mediterranian square in\
  \ the early dusk and the one in your small hometown. And many stairs you sit on\
  \ only when traveling and knowing that this is why life is worth living. Through\
  \ travel writing, they become eternal and shared. Stumbling through daily hustles\
  \ becomes not only easier to bear, but open horizon that - yes - full flavors of\
  \ life are to come again."
