Text: "There is a surreal, spiritual ambience to the Gangha river system. The junction\
  \ of Jamuna and Gangha is in Allahabad, coincidentally where my parents studied\
  \ and my dad worked, and where I lived for a year when I was four years old. It\
  \ is called the Triveni Sangam, the \u201Ctri\u201D being Sanskrit for \u2018three\u2019\
  , the third river being an invisible, mystic river called the Saraswati. My family\
  \ members are Hindu and believe that one is released from the cycle of birth and\
  \ death if buried here. I am not Hindu and had no preconceived ideas or expectations\
  \ of this place, but even I was struck by the feeling of peace and poignancy on\
  \ arriving. There is a large sandy foreshore and, despite the presence of the typical\
  \ life and colour of India, there is a peaceful stillness in the atmosphere, a quiet\
  \ reflection that is neither morose nor brooding but just gently soothing. Small\
  \ boats sit on the water\u2019s edge, and silhouette against a grey sky. Dark figures,\
  \ draped in loose jewel toned cotton, dot the sandy plain leading down to the water.\
  \ We hire a boat, and we are sold food for seagulls. Living in Australia, seagulls\
  \ have no particular charm, but these Siberian seagulls are handsome creatures,\
  \ and the locals get very enamoured by them surrounding the boat in a feeding frenzy\
  \ as morsel are cast into the air. My mind is cast back to Mum, whose one fragility\
  \ was an inability to see any creature hungry, saucers of milk laid out for mewling\
  \ stray kittens. The water of the Yamuna is a dove grey, and there is a visible\
  \ demarcation line where the rivers meet, beyond which the Ganga shimmers as an\
  \ eggshell white. A dhoti clothed pandit with a holy tika mark on his forehead leads\
  \ us through the prayers and rituals. As Mum\u2019s ashes are opened and my brother\
  \ starts to lift them out, the Pandit stops his prayers and insists we commit to\
  \ a particular price rise, higher than the agreed amount. We Australians are confused,\
  \ then bewildered, faltering, unsure of how to proceed. Our prayerful reveries are\
  \ disturbed, ripples of unease cutting through our fragile composures, our solemn\
  \ grief. My aunt who lives here knows the deal, and tells him: \u201Cplease continue,\
  \ you will get well rewarded, please don\u2019t stop\u201D. He interrupts proceedings\
  \ a few times. This is India, spiritual and material, side by side, almost inseparable.\
  \ We buy a bottle to take some of the River away for my aunt; however we change\
  \ our minds about this irreverent activity and hand the bottle, for which we paid\
  \ 20cents (10 rupees) back to the teenage boy selling them. He refunds our money\
  \ and refuses to accept a donation. My cousins advise me that even hard-pressed\
  \ working-class people have dignity and won\u2019t take your money without working\
  \ for it. It reminds me of the many times similar things have happened. Money is\
  \ often not talked about until the thin edge of the wedge, a taxi driver won't tell\
  \ me the cost, \u2018you are family (I\u2019m not) and I can even do this for free\u2019\
  . He doesn\u2019t mean this, of course, but is part of the sense of family love,\
  \ duty and connection that epitomises India. This is also India, dignity, generosity,\
  \ kindness."
