Text: "Spring 2018 I got an opportunity to go. Go and learn. I was given a new family\
  \ in totally different country with a new language. \nTwo weeks before my flight\
  \ to Spain, a family of 4 sent me a message asking if I could become an aupair in\
  \ their family. I was in such a hard situation in my life so I didn\u2019t even\
  \ think of saying no. I was recovering from illness, I was lost witg my life.\n\
  For me traveling has always been an opportunity to escape. Escaping the reality\
  \ and going out of your own bubble is something what you can\u2019t explain. You\
  \ have to feel that feeling. \n\nIn june, I landed to Spain. It was a sunny morning\
  \ and everything felt amazing. I was so happy. Family was welcoming, kids were amaing\
  \ and so sweet. I immediately felt like I was home. Walking the streets if Spain,\
  \ hearing spanish and just feeling free. I realized that life is amazing. I remember\
  \ running into an old spanish lady and she was doing laundry with her hands. \n\u201C\
  Old school\u201D I remember saying. I had a great eye opening conversation with\
  \ that lady. She told me a lot about a spanish culture, food ans people. It made\
  \ me so happy. \n\nSpain offered me to grow, I learnt how to surf, how to speak\
  \ a new language, how ti treat people and most of all it helped me to find myself.\
  \ While being in Spain I realized that traveling, hearing storyes and growing is\
  \ my thing. I really wanna help people to learn what\u2019s going on in this incredible\
  \ place called the earth."
