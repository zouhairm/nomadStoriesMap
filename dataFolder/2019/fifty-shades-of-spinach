Text: "I received a summer work from Denmark as an eighteenth birthday gift. I had\
  \ felt anxious in a strange way at home for a long time even though nothing had\
  \ changed there. Perhaps that is why. I had already acquiesced to spend one more\
  \ summer with gossip ladies of my hometown and planned to buy skyscraper-sized ice\
  \ creams while waiting for autumn. Among all of those feelings and thoughts I didn\u2019\
  t hesitate for a moment when the worker of the employment agency asked me if I was\
  \ interested in a job offer. \n\u201CTervetuloa! V\xE4lkommen! Welcome!\u201D the\
  \ cruise director repeated greetings like a robot. \nI had never travelled alone\
  \ before therefore I was truly nervous. I travelled by cruise ship to Stockholm\
  \ where I took a train over the southern part of Sweden and whole Denmark heading\
  \ against my coming home. Eventually around midnight I found the agricultural institution\
  \ that had depopulated for the summer. I opened a window in order to ventilate the\
  \ stale room and wished a good night for two horses who stared me spooky in the\
  \ silent night. \n\n\u201CYou need to pick up off-types and male spinaches that\
  \ try to invade a row of females,\u201D a Swedish colleague accustomed me in the\
  \ minibus on the way to the first field. \nI kept nodding and memorizing all the\
  \ information although I only wanted to wonder at wind turbines and the most idyllic\
  \ countryside I had ever seen. \n\u201CGames between different genders are forbidden\
  \ here. Pretty outdated, isn\xB4t it?\u201D she grinned then. \nEvery single plant\
  \ looked exactly like others to my mind and so I randomly picked some green plants\
  \ from a field corner to my sack for which an old farmer smirked benevolently beside\
  \ our minibus. My feet were dying after the nine-hour day. I was going to shamble\
  \ to my room when a bearded fellow asked me if I wanted to come along. It was the\
  \ first and last time when I answered by asking: \n\u201CWhere are you going to?\u201D\
  \ \n\nIt took only a week to get infected by the Spinach Curse. I diagnosed myself\
  \ based on symptoms like gazing manically at bags of spinach in the market after\
  \ a work day and speculating in the bus which fields have spinach. \nKilometers\
  \ increased quickly. I enjoyed of walking in flat and interminable fields where\
  \ I had a chance to get absorbed in my own thoughts with a warm breeze, sweat and\
  \ numb limbs. I learnt to name growth periods and cultivars as well as to filter\
  \ numerous shades of green. Time stopped running \u2014 I couldn\u2019t estimate\
  \ if it had elapsed two hours or twenty minutes since lunch when we wolfed down\
  \ our snacks in spite of juicy salad, melted cheese and a died fly on the top of\
  \ potatoes. \n\nIt was effortless to be with my coworkers who became my close friends\
  \ surprisingly fast. We used to study Danish culture during weekends by testing\
  \ cheap bilsners, expensive sandwiches and famous cycle paths. An unwritten rule\
  \ told us to share goods and food. Evenings got spent too fast by talking on the\
  \ roof until the sunset. \n\u201CI should go to sleep,\u201D we said thousands of\
  \ times after dark but nobody moved anyway. We extended evenings even though we\
  \ knew that our alarms would ring at five in the following mornings. \nThus, we\
  \ snored the rest of the week by leaning on each other in the minibus. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find that motley gang of young people from different countries and carefree\
  \ nights when I found the meaning of life for a moment.  I had a sense that I was\
  \ in the place where I was supposed to be with the people who pushed out the best\
  \ version of me. \nDoes one month in Danish fields equate with ten years friendship?\
  \ I already have a topic for my future thesis."
