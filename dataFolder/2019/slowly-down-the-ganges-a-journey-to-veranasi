Text: "My various journeys to the subcontinent have been taken in bite-sized 'chunks'\
  \ as exploring 'Incredible India\" is like savouring a fine wine....it cannot be\
  \ 'gulped'! A three-month trip exploring Noth East India ( Nagaland) and a long\
  \ overland journey across the plains of Rajasthan led me finally to the city that\
  \ I had been savouring like the last bite of a sumptuous dessert, Varanasi\n\nThis\
  \ is a place that has long held a deep fascination for me given its significance\
  \ for the millions of pilgrims who visit this spot on the Ganges each year.  My\
  \ story revolves around the cycle of life and death within the confines of this\
  \ overcrowded city and how seemingly death & life and spirituality are woven into\
  \ the fabric  of the 1000-year-old temples and crumbling, abandoned Maharajah palaces\
  \ that stand like soot covered Sentinels above the steps to the numerous ghats where\
  \ bodies, hoisted onto wood pyres, burn twenty-four hours a day. \n\nThe piece is\
  \ an observation of this unique city, its customs, people and daily life in general.\n\
  \nAs a travel writer, I tend to simply observe and try to 'paint a picture' of what\
  \ I 'see' even though I supply images with any story I write."
