Text: "The first time I saw him was the first time I met Venezuelan. \nIt was a sunny\
  \ day, just like most days in Andalusia with suffocating heat that you could barely\
  \ handle. I was sitting by the fountain drinking some fresh ice-cold water when\
  \ I first noticed him. Someone had blocked the sun and I slowly turned my head and\
  \ there he was, standing straight and proud with a charming smile on his face. His\
  \ skin color reflected a perfect coffee brown tone framed with deep amber eyes and\
  \ dark hair. \n\u201CWhat an unbearably hot day!\u201D he said while looking at\
  \ me directly in my eyes. \u201CLet me invite you for a drink\u201D, and they say\
  \ the rest is history\u2026\nThis is how I met Erick, a man whose name has burnt\
  \ into my mind forever. He was one of the most exceptional people I happened to\
  \ encounter on my travels so far. His heart was filled with kindness and his spoken\
  \ words were a reflection of the life lessons he was taught over 28 years.\nSoon\
  \ after, I found out that he was a refugee from Venezuela. He left his country due\
  \ to the turmoil and worsening standards of living and flew all the way to Europe\
  \ in the hope of a better life. \n\nOne day as I was sitting next to him I asked\
  \ him about the past. Up to now, he hadn\u2019t said much about his life in Venezuela,\
  \ instead, he was always focused on the now and present... At that moment he realized\
  \ that maybe it was okay to let his guard down for a fleeting moment. He paused,\
  \ took a deep breath and reached for my hands.\nHis compelling words took me back\
  \ to one of the hardest times of his life - the days when he was fighting for a\
  \ nation\u2019s freedom.\n\nWe found ourselves on an empty street where the once\
  \ vivid blocks of buildings were destroyed, shop windows were broken leaving everything\
  \ behind in filth and ruins. There was clearly a fight taken place right at the\
  \ spot where we were standing. \nI was confused, unsure of our location and gazed\
  \ at Erick in despair looking for some answers. After a couple of seconds, I heard\
  \ some distant noise - first a gunshot then hopeless roar.  \nAnxiety hit me like\
  \ an adrenaline shock when I realized we were on the streets of Caracas.\nRiots\
  \ had already erupted against the government forces making thousands of people go\
  \ outside on the streets. \nI was paralyzed by the shocking scene I encountered;\
  \ all I could do is to stand still in the middle of the broken glass, burnt down\
  \ buildings and fleshes of human bodies. I was terrified and could not even grasp\
  \ for air. Out of sudden, I could hear the noises of the people coming nearer and\
  \ nearer. \n\nAt the end of the street, I saw hundreds and even thousands of people\
  \ approaching us. I heard two gunshots and I quickly turned my head where the military\
  \ appeared. The two sides were about to crash into each other. From one end there\
  \ were the ordinary people of Venezuela and the other side was the military representing\
  \ the corrupt leaders that had driven the country over the edge. \n\nAs the people\
  \ reached us Erick marched to the front and led the crowd ahead. \nHis eyes were\
  \ in fierce anger and determination. As I looked into the eyes of the crowd all\
  \ I could see was desperation with tremendous willpower to free Venezuela from the\
  \ oppression. \nAll they wanted was to take back their country and they were ready\
  \ to sacrifice their lives for that. \nPeople were threateningly chanting \u201C\
  Freedom to Venezuela\u201D as they battled with the loyal forces of their unwanted\
  \ president. \n\nMy hands were shaking as I was still holding on to Erick\u2019\
  s restful arms. \n\u201CWhen will this end?\u201D I asked him horrified.\nHe reclined\
  \ his head and sighed with deep sadness. \n\u201CThis is still the present in Venezuela\
  \ and I left and stopped fighting against it.\u201D\nWe remained in silence sitting\
  \ on the quiet, sun-baked streets of Granada and thought about all the ones who\
  \ never had a chance to leave."
