Text: "It was one of those rare windy days a year in Tbilisi when I was wandering\
  \ around in Old Town. On my way down from the hill I met a woman. She was selling\
  \ fresh grape and orange juice. The smallest size of cup costed 5 GEL (Georgian\
  \ Lari), exactly what I wanted. I decided to spend my coins and started counting\
  \ them. The woman asked how much coins I had, I said 4. She asked me to give just\
  \ what I had and that would be fine. I thanked her and looked down to garbage bean\
  \ and saw only 1 used cup. It was around 5pm, almost evening. She might have emptied\
  \ the bean, or maybe people before me just took cups with themselves, or I was the\
  \ second only person who stopped by to get a drink and stayed there. The weather\
  \ was unpredictable. Felt that it was not very much cold, but windy. Oh, it was\
  \ so windy, only those streets and old houses could protect me from it. As many\
  \ steps were awaiting me ahead, I sat down near her and tasted the juice, which\
  \ was so fresh and naturally tasty. At that time there appeared the hero of my story,\
  \ Vasya.\n\nGuess who it was? Vasya is a short version of name Vasiliy. Vasya was\
  \ a duck. White colored, tall, self-confident. It went out of the yard to greet\
  \ me, played around with its tail, started smelling something nearby. Reminds you\
  \ someone? Yes, Vasya thought he was a dog. While I was watching Vasya, woman described\
  \ me how locals usually spend their evenings. She lived in an old building behind\
  \ her. It was several stories thin buildings connected with each other. All had\
  \ a common yard. All neighbors gathered in evening to discuss about different things\
  \ and enjoyed time spending with each other. It was a tradition. There were economically\
  \ difficult times back in 90th, when they lived in poor conditions. Therefore, to\
  \ survive each day one family from neighborhood would cook for the whole people\
  \ around this yard. \n\nVasya didn't leave us all that time, instead it leaned at\
  \ me and went inside when heard man talking. It was her husband. He was looking\
  \ for Vasya \u2013 \u201CVasya, Vasya, where are you? Go home, it is cold up there!\u201D\
  . Vasya of course understood everything and went inside and got to his house - a\
  \ little wooden box, just as same as for dogs. I was introduced to her husband and\
  \ very much liked him. The reason why most people like Georgia is for its peoples\u2019\
  \ hospitality and kindness. I just met him and I already liked him and his wife.\
  \ There was also another man, but I didn't know who he was, he just stayed in a\
  \ distance and looked at me with a gentle smile. We had a short discussion there\
  \ and woman's husband called for a dog. They had a curly haired doggy. Vasya started\
  \ worrying and running around, and its behavior seemed strange. Later I was explained\
  \ that it was just jealous of their dog, as he stole their attention, which he didn't\
  \ like at all. Vasya was brought home for their children to play, not for a meal.\
  \ They raised him as a dog. It was the only dock in neighborhood and in whole Old\
  \ Tbilisi as nobody there keeps chicken and ducks. \n\nVasya, the duck, much cared,\
  \ loved and adored. The happiest and luckiest duck in whole Tbilisi which will have\
  \ a natural death."
