Text: "Every Tuesday, a lady living on the outskirts of Uttarkashi opens her house\
  \ up to whoever might be in need of help from the spiritual realm. She gets possessed\
  \ by the Monkey God of her village, and so has a direct line for that sort of thing.\n\
  Jagmohan, going to visit her, asks if I\u2019d like to come along too. Always in\
  \ need of direction, wherever I might find it, I say yes. \nAs he drives Jagmohan\
  \ talks.\u201CYou know, Anna\u201D he said, looking over at me from the drivers\
  \ seat, \u201CMy dream is to become an actor in Bollywood! Everyday I think, should\
  \ I move to Mumbai?!\u201D\nJagmohan has an extremely impressive and bushy mustache\
  \ (tapered and twirlable). He is in his late 40s and whenever I have seen him he\
  \ has been dressed in a plain, collared shirt, trousers, and shiny leather dress\
  \ shoes. When I first met him I thought he was a businessman or an accountant. We\
  \ met in a shop where he gives out change, gossips and orders around his minions.\n\
  He tells me how a year ago, a Bollywood film was shot in Uttarkashi and he played\
  \ the role of a doctor. No dancing involved, but a substantial part none-the-less.\
  \ \nThe film\u2019s director told Jagmohan that he has an \u2018in demand\u2019\
  \ kind of face for such roles. Should Jagmohan ever be in Mumbai, be sure to give\
  \ him a call. But recently the director has not been answering his phone.\n \u201C\
  I am a most unfortunate man.\u201D He says, shaking his head as he steers the car\
  \ around blind corners and hairpin bends. \nTwenty minutes down the dusty road and\
  \ we arrive at a lime-green L-shaped house. There are people already waiting, including\
  \ a man with a live chicken in a plastic bag as a gift for the monkey god lady.\n\
  We wait beside a fire burning with  rubbish from around the yard. There is a small\
  \ dog on the roof of the shed (put there to keep it out of trouble), hay drying\
  \ in the sun, spinach in garden beds.  The sun comes and goes. The wind blows. We\
  \ wait. The tiny dog on top of the shed whimpers. \nFinally, it is our turn to go\
  \ into a tiny room tacked to one end of the house. There is an altar with sparkly\
  \ red cloth and unidentifiable objects wrapped in bundles. Incense smoke floats\
  \ in crazy patterns through the darkness.\nSeated on the floor, a lady starts to\
  \ recite a mantra. We sit down and she starts to beat on a drum and throws rice\
  \ in the air. Slowly her back straightens and she starts to breathe deeply and loudly,\
  \ flaring her nostrils. She sits up straighter, her body takes on a stance of strength\
  \ and authority. \nJagmohan lights a cigarette and holds it to her mouth and she\
  \ takes deep drags. She speaks to Jagmohan in a loud voice. \u201CWhat is the matter\
  \ child? I have opened a road for you, why have you failed to take it?\u201D\n\u201C\
  I have done everything I could.\u201D He says, \u201CI have been trying so hard.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou have not, you have been weak. You need to try harder. What have you\
  \ been doing in these past seven years? All of you, leave, go, now!\u201D she says,\
  \ gesturing to the rest of us. \nWe scramble to our feet and stumble over one another\
  \ to get out. \nOutside it is still windy, the sun is intermittent. The chicken\
  \ is still in its plastic bag. We drink more chai and listen to the sounds coming\
  \ from behind the closed door of the room. \nJagmohan is yelling. His voice is hysterical\
  \ and abusive, nothing like the polite, sweet man he seems to be.  After 20 minutes\
  \ or so, he comes out and throws up uncontrollably behind the house. \nHe douses\
  \ his head under a tap and walks over sopping, his concern for me. \u201CDon\u2019\
  t worry Anna, ok? It is just me. I am still the same man.\u201D He says. \u201C\
  Nothing has changed.\u201D \nOn the way home, he is quiet, lost in thought as he\
  \ stares at the road ahead."
