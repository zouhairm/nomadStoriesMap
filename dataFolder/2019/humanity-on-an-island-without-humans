Text: "1953 - The year of Joseph Stalin's death and Queen Elizabeth II's coronation.\
  \ It isn't difficult to find 1953 highlighted in a history book timeline.  The year\
  \ signaled a change in era across the world. President Truman announced the hydrogen\
  \ bomb. Dwight D. Eisenhower was inaugurated.  Watson and Crick discover the structure\
  \ of DNA. \n\nAcross the globe, miles from the empires currently at the center of\
  \ the worlds stage, laid Deception Island. While not  found in any textbook, 1953\
  \ marks the climax of humanity's impact on Deception Island. \n\nThe whaling out\
  \ post of the early 1900's had already been abandoned by 1953.  Still, Deception\
  \ island seemed strategically important to Great Britain, Argentina, and Chile and\
  \ tensions over the area had been growing for years. By 1953, conflict was inevitable.\
  \ The Argentine navy landed in January, and brought with them ten tons of soil as\
  \ symbolic gesture of their sovereignty over the island.  Chile followed by painting\
  \ 'Chile' onto the the British airfield. On February 15th the British frigate HMS\
  \ Snipe arrived, bringing police officers and marines. The Argentine and Chilean\
  \ outposts were destroyed and two men were arrested. \n\nI stood on the remnants\
  \ of the airstrip. Glass from broken windows mixed with brown and red pebbles along\
  \ the beach.  Groups of Antarctic fur seals sat beside abandoned, rusting whaling\
  \ equipment. I stood alone while my fellow tourists wandered around the island.\
  \ I couldn't help but twist my lips into a slight smile.  Within feet of where I\
  \ stood, three governments had clashed, committed petty acts of aggression and wasted\
  \ thousands of dollars. All for a piece of land that sixty-two years later does\
  \ not belong to any of them. \n\nMy self-righteous smirk faded into a slight frown\
  \ as I realized I too had allowed my trip to Antarctica to be marked by my own petty\
  \ nature. After all, I spent every evening silently pitying myself because I wasn't\
  \ as smart, or rich, or young, or \"well-traveled\" as my fellow passengers. I too\
  \ had brought humanity to Deception Island. \n\nHumbled, I continued my stroll around\
  \ whaler's bay. Seals waddled into the water while penguins laid on their bellies,\
  \ sunbathing. A group of graduate students let out an excited squeal as they saw\
  \ their first Chinstrap Penguin.  Further down the beach,  caution rope marked areas\
  \ tourists should avoid. Each small plot of land was part of a long-term scientific\
  \ study. \n\nAnother batch of students ran past me. It was time to leave and they\
  \ did not want to be the last ones one back to the ship. Hesitantly, I turned around\
  \ and followed them. Wading into the water, I boarded the zodiac. I turned to take\
  \ one last picture.\n\nI found myself taking a picture of humanity.  \n\nCorroded\
  \ buildings showcased our desire for wealth and the promise of industry, while also\
  \ reminding us of the cruelty we can inflict. An abandoned airstrip displayed our\
  \ courage, love of adventure, and need to explore.  The soil and empty flag pole\
  \ hinted our petty nature, and our desire to conquer and control our world.  And\
  \ the caution tape, placed by an international team of scientists, pointed to our\
  \ quest for knowledge and our deep-seated desire to live in a world of peace and\
  \ hope despite our pasts."
