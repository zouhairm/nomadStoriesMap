Text: "From the dusty roads of Pretoria flying to America was just a dream forgetting\
  \ that sky is the limit. 19 April 2010 was the day I kept pinching to see if it\u2019\
  s surely me going to great state of Florida. Taking a great amount of time crossing\
  \ the Atlantic Ocean became in need of rest or sleep. Every time I stared at the\
  \ Delta flight map with mouth open wide, typically in amazement and astonishment\
  \ that was 10 hours away from dream coming true. With the enthusiasm intense and\
  \ eager enjoyment, interest, and approval sleeping was the last thing in my mind.\
  \  Movies kept me diligent not disremembering the Timbaland and Jay Z Blueprint\
  \ 3 moved me rhythmically. Flight Attendant voice that we about to land most of\
  \ the people in the flight woke up, relieved that we completed our long endpoint\
  \ to Atlanta airport. Finally saw the mind blowing Atlanta skyscrapers I knew well\
  \ that have reached our destination. Pilots perfected touchdown completely free\
  \ from faults. Cheering from the travellers with smiles made me realise that I left\
  \ my family, 3years girlfriend and friends. Took few minutes praying thanking God\
  \ before taking my carry on bag to the immigration line. \n\nGetting to ATL IMMIGRATION\n\
  \nAfter 20 hours on a plane drained was the moment, where I get my first US stamp\
  \ on my South African passport. It was 7am when we touched down, I felt at home\
  \ when everybody who worked at the airport had the professional look, smiles welcoming\
  \ everybody to the USA, and hoping we enjoy our stay. I met a girl from my hometown\
  \ Johannesburg while walking to the immigration officers, and she ask what will\
  \ I be doing here it turned out that me and her will be working together. Got your\
  \ passport stamped by officers asked me few question to see what I know what will\
  \ I be doing, they kindly welcomed me with a smile. My next task was to get my luggage,\
  \ after that I remember seeing lots of US army\u2019s coming from Iraq. The security\
  \ at the gate was firm, dogs sniffing our bag, taking my shoes off, had to take\
  \ off all the metals I had and put them in a bucket then and the body scan twice.\
  \ After all the security hassles it was time to get my connecting flight to MCO\
  \ inside one of the biggest airport, Fortunately the kindliness of the workers made\
  \ it easy to find.  Immediately after finding the flight to MCO it was time to board,\
  \ checked in my bags for a two hours flight, which wasn\u2019t bad like the 20 hours,\
  \ one flew. It felt like a second we arrived in Orlando, was even better that I\
  \ didn\u2019t have to go thru immigrations and securities. \n\nOrlando to Disney\
  \ \n\nThe process of getting my luggage way too easy this time at MCO compared to\
  \ ATL dogs sniffing. Almost 25 hours of flying I met my work maids from Botswana\
  \ also going with me to Disney, started removing fear that I wont be lost alone.\
  \ We all went to Mears Cabs to take us to place of residence. It was a 20-30 minutes\
  \ drive to a place called vista way where we were meant to meet our employees, to\
  \ show us where we will be settling. The first thing I saw from them was a warm\
  \ smile and joy of welcome where dreams come true. They gave us all the information\
  \ we need took us to our place of residence that was 5 minutes away. When we got\
  \ to the Commons they individually took us to our apartments, was fortunate that\
  \ mine was the first building on the block. They gave me my keys and all the significant\
  \ information one would need."
