Text: "Stepping out of the house just as the sun was rising above the jungle capped\
  \ mountains, he was there, devotedly waiting for me. His deep brown eyes and warming\
  \ essence made me feel special. Just as I approached him, Amma came out the house\
  \ cursing and shaking her fists, \u201CI\u2019ve told you not to come round here,\
  \ go, I don\u2019t want to see you here again.\u201D\n\nHis eyes met the ground\
  \ and he slowly started to walk away, I hurriedly caught up with him whilst singing\
  \ back to Amma, \u201CSee you later, have a beautiful day.\u201D\n\nAs we strolled\
  \ side by side down the mini mountain I rambled on and on, \u201Cdon\u2019t worry\
  \ about Amma, she is just trying to protect me. Today I have a busy day at work\
  \ its the school sports show so I won\u2019t be able to hang out with you all day\
  \ but we can catch up later,\u201D I promised as I left him at the school gate.\
  \ \n\nThrough the day between liaising sack races, high jumps and cheering children\
  \ I could see him watching me through the fence and I could feel the love for him\
  \ glowing through me. I wanted to run over and kiss him but I had the reminder from\
  \ my thought's that\u2019s not very professional right now. \n\nAs the school day\
  \ drew to an end I couldn\u2019t see him through the fence waiting for me anymore\
  \ and figured he won\u2019t be far. As I said my goodbyes to the students and staff\
  \ I exited the gate and he had gone, I felt a little hollow but knew it\u2019s a\
  \ bit unfair for me to expect him to just spend his day waiting for me. \n\nI followed\
  \ my usual route home along the dried mud path and it was unusually quiet, no other\
  \ people in sight even the cooling breeze was absent. \n\nGrowling coming from behind\
  \ me made me turn rapidly and realise two spit flying angry dogs were running. \n\
  \nThey were running towards me! \n\nMy only thought was, \u2018how much is this\
  \ going to hurt?\u2019 As I was visualising my feet running but the reality was\
  \ they had gone numb with fear. My eyes were even too numb to close to at least\
  \ save me from witnessing the the event about to unfold before me. As the growling\
  \ became a auditory blur, 'He', jumped from out of the jungle bushes and directly\
  \ into the spit flying dogs mouths. We locked eyes for a moment and my numbness\
  \ melted and I ran.\n\nI ran in the opposite direction. \n\nI ran all the way back\
  \ and was surrounded by people asking what had happened as I was trying to catch\
  \ my breathe but I had no words in that moment to share. Only the feeling of betrayal.\
  \ He had saved me and sacrificed himself. I sat central on the rock where we would\
  \ usually meet and waited. It felt like the longest time as tears slid down my cheeks.\
  \ When I lifted my gaze I saw him limping and still devotedly coming to find me.\
  \ I ran over to him and gave him the longest hug.\n\nAs I searched his body for\
  \ wounds his tail was wagging and he licked my face, in a way that was his message\
  \ to say he forgives me for running away. \n\nSpot the street dog saved my life\
  \ that day and will always be a friend truely remembered."
