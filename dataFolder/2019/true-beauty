Text: "August last year i decided to do something different on my birthday. 10 days\
  \ to go, book myself a flight to Bali and a very unscripted holiday.\nIt wasnt my\
  \ first time there, so i took the time to relax by the pool, explore the resorts\
  \ around, and get long foot massages.\nThe weather was amazing, much cooler than\
  \ i remembered. And to complete my luck, the sea was calm so i went back to the\
  \ famous beach from Eat, Pray, Love - Padang Padang. On the previous time i\u2019\
  ve been there a couple of years ago the tide was so high that there was almost no\
  \ sand left.\nOn my last day I took a day trip to Ulun Danu Bratan temple, such\
  \ a peaceful place! I was walking around, taking pictures then decided to stop for\
  \ a bit to admire the view of the lake.\nThere was a group of indonesians taking\
  \ pictures in front of the temple and i started observing them. They seemed so happy\
  \ and very creative in posing!\nThats when a girl approached me with a friend and\
  \ asked if i could take a picture with her! \nShe then smiled so sweetly and with\
  \ a happy face told me: you are so beautiful! We took a couple of pictures and although\
  \ she didnt speak much English we managed to talk for a bit.\nShe was the true beauty\
  \ in that scenery!"
