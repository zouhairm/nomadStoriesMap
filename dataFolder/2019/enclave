Text: "We are surrounded by sand and gravel. A temple made of chalky stone, topped\
  \ with three blue and orange domes looks like a mirage. Nerg\xFCi approaches me\
  \ when I am wandering next to the white platform of the Altar of Heaven. We stand\
  \ still for a second and admire the golden pagoda in the middle of the circle made\
  \ of white stone.   \n\nWe are both strangers here. I am from Europe and he is from\
  \ Dongbei, the Northeast part of China. The Chinese part. But he is a native Mongolian,\
  \ came to Inner Mongolia to visit the tomb of the greatest hero of his people. Stranger\
  \ in a place he belongs. He told me his name, but I will call my companion Nerg\xFC\
  i, which means \"Nameless\" in his language - because the name he mentioned was\
  \ Chinese and we are far from China, although still within its borders. He can be\
  \ finally himself here.\n\n30 kilometers through the sands from this place there\
  \ is Kangbashi, the most famous Chinese ghost city. Thousands of tower blocks were\
  \ built in the heart of Ordos desert almost two decades ago. But since then, most\
  \ of them have never been inhabited. They are rising from the sand, like empty,\
  \ silent towers of concrete. Abandoned streets are still waiting for the moment,\
  \ when they will fill up with bustling crowds of people and cars.\nIt ts much more\
  \ ghostly here. But although this place is also an uninhabited oasis in the  desert,\
  \ unlike Kangbashi, it has a spirit. \n\nThis is the Mausoleum of Ghenghis Khan,\
  \ the hero of all Mongolians. A half-god and the conqueror of almost whole Asia.\
  \ Why was the greatest of all Mongolians buried here? Not only in the middle of\
  \ a desert, but far from the centre of his empire, Karakorum? The answer is simple.\
  \ He was not. The real grave of Great Khan remains an unsolved mystery. \n\nWe move\
  \ ahead, passing the stupas and sacred stone heaps called ovoos. Maybe we should\
  \ stop and circle one of these three times, as it brings luck in Mongolian tradition?\
  \ But we move on, as the blue ceremonial scarves covering them are fluttering in\
  \ the wind. \nAn old woman is trying to walk down the stairs. She is holding a walking\
  \ stick in one hand, as her right leg hangs limply under the traditional Mongolian\
  \ dress. Nerg\xFCi grabs her arm gently and helps her to make another step. They\
  \ exchange a few words in their language and I know, that they are talking about\
  \ me. She looks at me, but her wrinkled, bronzed face shows no reluctance, just\
  \ curiosity and calm.  \n\nAt first, I am disappointed as we enter the building.\
  \ It is like a museum, no magic, no spirit. Just the bunch of objects that were\
  \ supposed to belong to the khan. But when we enter the main hall, the magic begins.\n\
  \nA group of Mongolians is sitting on the floors in front of the golden statue of\
  \ Genghis Khan. At his feet, there is a brass bowl full of huge pieces of meat.\
  \ An offering for the god.\nThey are singing. I don't understand the language, but\
  \ the song is so powerful I have to hold my breath. Golden Temujin, almost invisible\
  \ below the whirls of incense smoke, is looking at us. His people brought his spirit\
  \ here, to the fake mausoleum in the middle of the void.. \n\nNerg\xFCi offers me\
  \ a lift to the nearest town, where I can take a bus back to Ordos city. The motorbike\
  \ is old and its saddle, lined with something that looks like a carpet, is covered\
  \ with dust. But it somehow fits here much more than a new, spotless car would.\n\
  As we are riding, I watch the camels grazing on withering plants on the side of\
  \ the road. I wonder if there is at least a small chance, at least one for million,\
  \ that Ghenghis Khan was really buried here. But than I realize it doesn\u2019t\
  \ really matter."
