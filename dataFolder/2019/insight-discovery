Text: "A public bus, the blue and old style one in Chiang Mai, or a songthaew, the\
  \ yellow truck, not too common for tourists but still precious to move around. Since\
  \ the beginning, it appeared the journey of decisions, something amid scaring and\
  \ challenging for a girl who knew nothing clear about herself but to be an eternal\
  \ undecided. At the South gate of Chiang Mai, the most populated city of Northern\
  \ Thailand, I was looking for my transportation to Chomthong Temple, where I finally\
  \ had the chance to immerse myself in a 14 days retreat of Vipassana meditation.\
  \  \nFinally, yes, because it\u2019d been almost 5 years since I decided to try\
  \ this mindfulness\u2019 experience. I used to be skeptical, with a mood always\
  \ oriented towards the most reasonable train of thoughts; I used to refer to meditation\
  \ as an escape-way from reality, something not for me. On a warm Indonesian evening,\
  \ though, surrounded by blossoming lotus flowers, I met Adara, that Russian girl\
  \ who I\u2019d really want to tell this story to, but I have no means to contact\
  \ her back again. Our conversation started in the most spontaneous way, as when\
  \ a couple of girls meet in a country far from home, own culture and taste. The\
  \ practice of Vipassana, or Insight meditation, for a whole month on a mount in\
  \ Northern Thailand alone with a monk, changed Adara\u2019s life forever. At least,\
  \ she believed this in that moment. Her smooth and sincere emotions won me. When\
  \ she firmly ended her incredible story with \u201CIt\u2019s just the mind\u201D\
  , I was not asking for more descriptions, no more questions; I was fascinated, transported,\
  \ in a word convinced. After about 5 years, when the chain of events knocked on\
  \ my door, the memory of Adara came back to me with an unexpected smile. \nIt\u2019\
  d be impossible to describe those days in detail here, especially because I\u2019\
  d need to explain all the meditation path, something really precious that one should\
  \ try alone to understand. Or not. Disbelieving is always an option. Furthermore,\
  \ the risk to influence someone who wants to try is a great responsibility. If Adara\
  \ had told me every single moment of her experience, I\u2019d never have jumped\
  \ on that yellow truck. After all, this little story could have already introduced\
  \ you to some kind of feeling, maybe curiosity, and this matters more than exposing\
  \ in a few words how my mind turned to be a dangerous enemy and ally at the same\
  \ time. It was powerful, and today I smile again thinking of Adara and her unclear\
  \ message \u201Cit\u2019s just the mind\u201D.\nAs always, I let the destiny, or\
  \ circumstances, to choose for me. It started with the yellow songthaew, since the\
  \ blue bus crossed my way too late to catch it. I stepped on the little truck and\
  \ all my imagination turned into reality. After a pleasant two hours journey, with\
  \ locals jumping on and off the car as desired, the driver stopped in front of a\
  \ 7Eleven. He came to me at the backside and pointed the way to the Temple. The\
  \ unknown place I\u2019d been imagined for long was there and it\u2019d been easier\
  \ to reach it than ever expected. In that fragment of time and space, in front of\
  \ the main entrance of Chomtong Temple, I thought just for a second that the road\
  \ to mindfulness must be paved with easy little steps, since I\u2019d been building\
  \ entire movies in my mind on the first approach to this crazy experience, and it\
  \ appeared too easy for such a hard situation. Yes, because among a few important\
  \ rules of the retreat, I have to mention: wake up at 4am - walking/sitting meditation\
  \ - breakfast at 6am - meditation - lunch at 11am (the last meal of the day) - meditation\
  \ from noon to 10pm; no reading/writing/chatting, since the mind should be always\
  \ mindful of every movement, feeling or thought, no other distraction allowed. I\
  \ know it sounds extreme, but I\u2019d already took my decision, or let the destiny\
  \ do it for me, when I jumped on that yellow truck in the morning. No matter how\
  \ hard it could be, leaving, as disbelieving, was always an option."
