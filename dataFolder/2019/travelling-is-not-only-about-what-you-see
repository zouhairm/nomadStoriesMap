Text: "People are inevitable part of our everyday life but when it comes to traveling\
  \ their importance increases in several times. And here's why. Have you ever enjoyed\
  \ a country where people do not smile back at you? Where cashiers are mean and impolite?\
  \ Where no one helps you when you are lost? When there's no one to play the sign\
  \ language game when you speak different languages? Wherever I go my goal is to\
  \ get to know local people. \n\nThis new year I spent in Italy. The trip I planned\
  \ and organised for my mom and my friend. Only 8 days and more than 6 cities. The\
  \ route was changing 100 times and the outcome was incredibly satisfying for all\
  \ of us. It was very different from my typical solo travels with Couchsurfing and\
  \ direct contact with locals. Airbnbs, renting a car, having a group of three totally\
  \ different people, cruising around all the touristic places couldn't promise a\
  \ very close communication with any strangers. And I was not expecting to fall for\
  \ Italians and Italy the way I did. I do not speak Italian yet (but feel like I\
  \ need to after this trip) and was amazed how in a small town in Tuscany the whole\
  \ restaurant helped us to order the best meals we've had there. Three tables around\
  \ us were the group of translators between us and the waiter and later on, they\
  \ were suggesting us places to go to and explaining the best way to the hot springs.\
  \ But the most touching connection was with the 80 years old woman who helped us\
  \ to get off at the necessary stop from the bus. Meanwhile, telling the story of\
  \ her life: being deported from the Chez Republic at the age of nine and finding\
  \ her family in Italy 6 years later. And event though she is not Italian born, she\
  \ is a true Italian. By the way she talks with expressive gestures and the spark\
  \ in the eyes, by the explicit eye contact that makes you connected in the moment\
  \ and by the relaxed manner of life.\n\nAt the end of my journeys I am touched by\
  \ sceneries and places but the brightest memories are from the pleasant smiles,\
  \ the warmth in the heart from some stranger being kind to you and from realising\
  \ how are we all similar despite all the borders and stereotypes."
