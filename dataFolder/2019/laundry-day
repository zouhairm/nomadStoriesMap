Text: "I could blame it on the exhaustion from the hike I had completed mere moments\
  \ before. I could blame Mount Rainier for distracting me with its snow-capped majesty\
  \ in the distance. But by the time I noticed the ingress of boots thudding on the\
  \ grassy knoll, it was too late to stop him, much less move out of the way. He brushed\
  \ so closely that our eyes locked. And just like that, he leapt off the mountain.\n\
  \nEarlier that day, I thought I was prepared for anything. Pacific Northwest winters\
  \ can get brisk, especially for Californians like me. So when I saw patches of snow\
  \ hugging the Ponderosa Pines at the foot of the mountain I marched back to the\
  \ car to don my full winter gear. Back on the trail, it only took about ten minutes\
  \ and one hundred feet of elevation to realize my mistake. The leftover snow in\
  \ the shadow of the pines was quickly replaced by giant leaves in steaming heaps\
  \ of duff. \n\nI had to break up my ascent, pausing every hundred meters of elevation\
  \ or so to remove another layer. Halfway up West Tiger Mountain, I could hardly\
  \ see the trail in front of me over the pile of clothes stacked in my arms. I dumped\
  \ my gear on a patch of moss to adjust the faux fur parka that kept slipping from\
  \ my waist. The sleeves were just too thick to fasten in a knot. Evidently, the\
  \ locals were very familiar with the valley breeze that convected the mountainside.\
  \ I was only mildly embarrassed every time a Washingtonian passed me in their fitted\
  \ high-performance polyester. While they had also stripped down to more sensible\
  \ layers, they clearly planned ahead by bringing extra large backpacks to fit all\
  \ the gear they shed. I did get to take some comfort in the fellow overpackers that\
  \ passed. They obviously wouldn\u2019t be needing those ski masks and face goggles,\
  \ but I felt solidarity in the misleading climate at the foot of the mountain.\n\
  \nI gathered my laundry and carried on.\n\nOnly one hour later than anticipated,\
  \ I reached the shoulder summit. At the end of the trail, the minty evergreens parted,\
  \ opening up to a vast mountainside meadow. The leafy detritus of the trail was\
  \ replaced by plush meadow grass that rippled when the wind swept the knoll. But\
  \ the real source of this hike\u2019s popularity could be seen just beyond the meadow.\
  \ Exceeding all expectations, Mount Rainier stood stoically in the distance, perfectly\
  \ framed by the clearing and perfectly unobstructed from this viewing height. Mesmerized,\
  \ I moved toward the edge of the mountain where the meadow abruptly dropped off\
  \ in a steep cliff.\n\nI searched for a good spot to lay my gear. I had thought\
  \ that my parka would at least make a good picnic blanket to redeem my efforts lugging\
  \ it up the mountain. But the meadow grass was so soft that a blanket wasn\u2019\
  t necessary. It was so soft, it almost completely muffled the thumps of a runner's\
  \ footsteps...\n\nAs he leapt the wind kicked up and filled the cells of an electric-blue\
  \ canopy. The risers groaned slightly under tension when he settled into his backpack\
  \ seat as the wind spiraled him higher and higher. An outbreak of applause from\
  \ across the meadow caught my attention, and I turned around to a line of paragliders\
  \ prepping for takeoff. I gathered my laundry off the apparent runway and settled\
  \ in to my newfound view."
