Text: "One night in Belgrade could definitely make a hard man humble. So, what would\
  \ a stay the duration of five days do to me?\nMy first ever work trip as a travel\
  \ writer went to Belgrade, which at this stage still was in its wake as the cultural\
  \ and party destination it has become today. I was rather new in my position as\
  \ the editor for a developing Swedish online magazine, and quite frankly death scared\
  \ to be insufficient in my competence.\nI remember feeling sick for nervousness\
  \ while preparing my luggage (in a borrowed suitcase, a less ragged one than my\
  \ own). What on earth had I to do among these other, much more qualified journalists?\n\
  A grumpy first impression\nWe take a late flight from Arlanda, where I meet up with\
  \ my travel companions over a drink. After a grumpy first impression of some of\
  \ them, the red wine seems to work its magic and eventually even I begin to relax\
  \ slightly. The flight is agreeable, and we arrive safely at the Nikola Tesla airport\
  \ in Belgrade. I would perhaps have preferred to dive straight into my comfortable\
  \ bed at the hotel. But our person in charge suggests a night cap and a sandwich\
  \ in the lounge, all together. \nAs we sit there, savouring the food and beverages,\
  \ the conversation topics slide into authentic tourism and individually tailored\
  \ trips, as opposed to charter and stereotype group travel, with a cheerful guide\
  \ at the front carrying a sign or a flag. \nWe all agree that this latter kind of\
  \ travel is not our cup of tea. Not good for the destinations either, and definitely\
  \ not a suitable way to explore Belgrade. As I am still quite nervous, and not very\
  \ experienced in my field either, the best association I can come up with is a Disney\
  \ story by the renowned comics editor Carl Barks, where Donald and the nephews are\
  \ stunned too, by the group travel phenomenon.\nDoubting my future \n\u201CThis\
  \ makes me think of this comic by Carl Barks, do you know Carl Barks?\u201D, I stutter,\
  \ just to take part in the discussion. Four out of five co-travellers, all male,\
  \ look at me in disbelief. \u201CNo, not really\u201D. \n\u201COkay\u201D. I take\
  \ a deep breath. At least I need to finish my story. That goes with my tentative\
  \ profession as a writer, even though at the moment, I seriously start doubting\
  \ to have a future within the travel writing business. In a few words I then explain\
  \ the plot of this particular cartoon, and that Carl Barks is actually an amazing\
  \ cartoonist and artist. All of this without breathing. \u201CGreat\u201D, I say\
  \ to myself, silently, \u201CEnough of making a fool of yourself. Time to get out\
  \ of here \u2013 and please keep your mouth shut for the rest of the trip\u201D\
  .\nAt that point, the final member of our group, a skilled journalist whom I today\
  \ count among my friends, but who had a way back then of looking rather hostile,\
  \ suddenly relaxes his sullen face into a warm smile. \u201CI know Carl Barks\u201D\
  , he says, friendly at once, \u201CAnd I know very well that story. I even have\
  \ a signed personal message from Mr Barks at home, after I met him many years ago\u201D\
  .\nSomething has changed\n\u201CWow, that\u2019s amazing!\u201D. My surprise could\
  \ not have been any bigger. The rest of our travel colleagues look puzzled and I\
  \ decide that this may be the perfect occasion for retiring to my room and get some\
  \ sleep. It turns out to be pretty much the last sleep I should have during this\
  \ trip. Belgrade nightlife was high on the organiser\u2019s agenda \u2013 and who\
  \ could blame them? It is after all an important USP of the city.\nWe nearly miss\
  \ the return flight back to Stockholm, which is scheduled to 6 AM on a Saturday.\
  \ As I finally lean back into my seat with a deep sigh of relief, I can feel that\
  \ something has changed. The travel bug in me has awoke for real. I took a first\
  \ shaky step into the unknown reality of the travel writers. And from this day on,\
  \ nothing will ever quite be the same again."
