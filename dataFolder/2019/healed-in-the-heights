Text: "The awkward, bitter emptiness I was left in after a harsh breakup few months\
  \ shy of my wedding day, could hardly be described at that time, let alone, shared.\n\
  Around that time, my grandad was planning on visiting \u2013maybe for the last time-\
  \ his hometown, Salta, in the northwest region of my country, Argentina. With a\
  \ lust for a change of scene, no expectations and even less demands on my destination,\
  \ I decided to tag along. After all, travelling with an 84-year-old guy, and staying\
  \ at his 75-year-old sister\u2019s place can be an adventure in itself.\nI had been\
  \ told that the hard-to-reach village of Iruya, near Salta, was a great place to\
  \ visit for its magnificent sceneries and unique views. I decided to leave the house\
  \ to the mature siblings, not before dropping a white lie to avoid warnings and\
  \ worries. \nTwo long hours into the ride I came across the most breath-taking landscape:\
  \ A zigzagging road through the greenest mountains, crossed by thin threads of crystal-clear\
  \ water. Below, a soft cushioned layer of clouds. I wondered how dwellers could\
  \ take this vision for granted whilst I could hardly grasp the idea of riding a\
  \ bus through such a spectacular, dangerous road at the edge of an abyss. Was I\
  \ dreaming? Local\u2019s colorful costumes, smelly farm animals and lively children\
  \ wrapped around their waists told me that I did not belong to that part of the\
  \ world.\nTwo outsiders at the bottom road seemed as astonished as I was. I checked\
  \ on their faces and told myself they could be my trip mates. When we arrived at\
  \ our final destination, in one piece despite \u2013or thanks to- the careless but\
  \ most experienced driver, a little girl held my hand tightly. She tugged at me\
  \ through a bunch of tourists, and then spoke to me in a sort of mixed dialect:\
  \ I would be her guest at her mother\xB4s hotel and she should lead me to the other\
  \ side of the bridge.\nBefore leaving, I made sure to have my partners in crime\
  \ with me in my small trip to the old town of San Isidro, which could only be reached\
  \ on foot during the dry season. The two guys, both from Buenos Aires, were more\
  \ than pleased to have some sort of companion and somewhere to go to on the next\
  \ day of their stay. \nThe following day, my new friends and I rendezvoused and\
  \ joined a middle-aged woman that worked as a walking tour guide. The guys were\
  \ not very confident of her hiking skills, but the woman\u2019s wrinkly smile told\
  \ me that there were not many stones and curves in our way that she had not seen\
  \ before.\nWhat the three of us quickly learnt is that Iruya is a unique site, a\
  \ picturesque village \u201Changing from the mountains\u201D, with winding and mountainous\
  \ gravel roads. Its narrow colonial streets undoubtedly invite you to the past.\
  \ Condors can be seen flying very close due to the altitude of this \u201Ckolla\u201D\
  \ town. Its inhabitants are a fundamental and decisive part of the landscape with\
  \ an excellent human quality.\n\nWhile strolling through a huge canon, with water\
  \ up to our knees, I remembered how nice life is, how gifted we are and how pleasant\
  \ it is to feel that you can rely on somebody else\xB4s experience to lead you through\
  \ the toughest parts of the way. Listening to her harsh and courageous life story\
  \ we learnt that she had been abandoned by both her parents, and later by her husband,\
  \ to take care of her six children. This was one of her many ways of earning a living.\
  \ \n\u2018I never feel alone\u2019, said the woman, with a soft musical tone that\
  \ can only be heard in that part of the world. \nI felt dumb and vane for all the\
  \ self-pity that I had been carrying along during that trip and thanked God for\
  \ showing me that you can always choose to lead your own way, and even shed a light\
  \ on the other\xB4s path, in the most unexpected ways."
