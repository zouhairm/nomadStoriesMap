Text: "In the lost light of darkness,  the mountains seemed unappalled by the thunderous\
  \ burst from the heavens. They stood hardbound to the earth just as ever. \n\nNeither\
  \ our clothes nor our baggages on our back could withstand to shun the outrage of\
  \ the skies.  We all dripped in the unfading night.  Once again wiping my glasses\
  \ off to a near clear vision , I balanced my hiking pole onto the lave rocky steps.\
  \ The other half of the journey was yet to be crossed.\n\nOccasionally my pole just\
  \ like my feet would slip over within inches of being buried into the dense void.\
  \ Quite often the ambiguous paths would lead me to the chasm of death. But my fellow\
  \ friends, who walked like a contingent on a mission to survival, would rescue me\
  \ from it's mouth. \n\nThe tiny source on our cellphones could only produce feeble\
  \ light into the boundless blackness. At a point, I lost all my hopes of making\
  \ it to Dhampus,  the entrance to the enchanting Annapurna ranges. Yes, the locals\
  \ described it as a bewitching beauty which never failed to behold its charm upon\
  \ the viewer. Nonetheless, this struggle had to be endured with patience and alertness.\
  \ \n\nOn reaching the cottage,  many so us found leeches stuck to our legs, trickling\
  \ blood down onto the floor. A local attendant there adviced us to rub salt over\
  \ them till the bats of the jungle left its prey. After relief was provided,  I\
  \ proceeded towards my tent. There,  I lay on the wet mattress, comforted by my\
  \ soaked clothes, looking at nothing but believing everything which preceded it.\
  \ I drifted off to a peaceful dreamless sleep. \n\nWhen I opened my eyes,  the morning\
  \ had just began to wear in. From the narrow passage of view through my tent, I\
  \ could witness the clouds unmasking the snow-crested Annapurna Ranges,  proclaiming\
  \ its worth more than a walk through a nightstorm. I sat there gazing at the unfathomable\
  \ untill the sky transfused into its brightest blue. Altogether,  it left me with\
  \ a bunch of unanswered questions. \nCan someone live the whole of their life in\
  \ just a moment? Can something so tangible yet impalpable realise one of being alive,\
  \ of being limitless? Can one cry on discovering what lies beyond the horizon? \n\
  A smiled stretched over my face as I stood up to wrap the blanket around myself,\
  \ ready to walk towards the Roof Of the World."
