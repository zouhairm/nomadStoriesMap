Text: "For the past few months I had been traveling around South America and Europe.\
  \ I\u2019m from South America Ecuador, my city is Guayaquil but at the moment I\u2019\
  m leaving in London. Last year I decided to take along holidays  and to travel back\
  \ home for Christmas. Since then  I haven\u2019t stop traveling. I went to Bah\xED\
  a de Caraquez that is located in the Spondylous route at 4 or 5hours approximately\
  \ driving by car. I could say it was a trip to the past. The food in Bah\xEDa was\
  \ delicious.  Everything that they made is fresh homemade, their taste of the sea\
  \ food is unique. My favourite food there is patacones, (fry plantain) corviche\
  \ a mix of fish and plantain that is fry I was in even trying all the local food\
  \ there. Their architecture looked the same as I leave it 11 years ago, very colourful\
  \ but they don\u2019t have the ferry to cross to another city because they build\
  \ a long bridge that now is very quickly to go to another city. We drove further\
  \ up Bah\xEDa and we went to Pedernales. Pedernales is a wonderful town but still\
  \ recovering from the Earthquake in 2016. The people  still look the same happy\
  \ and hopeful. The sunset at their beaches are epic. My parents used to live there\
  \ so all my childhood after school I passed it there. After 11 years I was back\
  \ and a lot of memories came to my mind. That days was very sunny that my family\
  \ and I had a sunbathe. The sea was a bit cold I didn\u2019t mind we were so happy\
  \ until a jelly fish burn my skin then my dad rescued me and put me some urine as\
  \ a home remedy. The hours passed so quick that when we saw it was nearly the evening\
  \ so I needed to say good bye and drive back to Bah\xEDa. Due that the next day\
  \ I had a volunteering day at Sathya Sai school. We rent a room in Saiananda a hotel\
  \ in Bah\xEDa that is 100%vengetarian. My room was a boungalo near the river and\
  \ the view was amazing. It\u2019s a very quiet place and you can connect with your\
  \ soul. My experience was that I found myself there and I found the real meaning\
  \ of love, to help those children to become good women and men one day with good\
  \ values and good aspirations of the future. That day I could talked with the children\
  \ and their parents and give some advices to help their children to raise with good\
  \ values and to be good parents. This trip helped me to find a local connection\
  \ with the people. I could be involved with the community to share stories and to\
  \ learn the real meaning of love. My days in Bah\xEDa end with the most beautiful\
  \ memories, it was time to go back to the city. The Christmas time came and we had\
  \ a big celebration and a few days later I traveled to the beach and I went on a\
  \ scuba diving adventure in the Pacific Ocean coast what an amazing experience I\
  \ got. In Ayangue the sea was calm and the visibility was clear. I saw  \na lot\
  \ of sea life that you could imagine. After diving we had lunch on the beach and\
  \ the food of the restaurant was so delicious I Ordered an octopus ceviche yummm\
  \ I\u2019m already imagining. They prepared the food as 50years a go everything\
  \ made with an wood oven in where they cooked the best food ever and the good thing\
  \ is that the plate are not too small. I had the opportunity to dive twice and to\
  \ enjoy every minute of the sun shinning on my face. What great holidays I could\
  \ travel around my country and to get involved with different ecosystems. Think\
  \ that Ecuador is a unique country, rich in culture with a tropical weather and\
  \ folkloric clothes. I am very proud to be Ecuadorean, I really hope next time I\
  \ can travel to the deep Amazon. So I can have a local connection with the tribu,\
  \ to see that mysterious and wonderful land and to go on boat trips."
