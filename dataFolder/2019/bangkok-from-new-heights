Text: "Imagine\u2026I\u2019ve been dropped off by the taxi driver who had claimed\
  \ he knew my destination in Bangkok when I hailed him down in Salaya. The restaurant\
  \ I\u2019ve been excited to try has been on my list of \u201Cmust do\u2019s\u201D\
  \ while I\u2019m studying abroad in Thailand. Sixty minutes of traffic later and\
  \ here I are, standing at the mouth of a\_busy soi.\_I\u2019ve forgotten to look\
  \ where the driver had been going, since my attention was focused on the amulet\
  \ shrine/art installation at the dash of his car. I pay the meter, step out, and\
  \ decide whether to go straight into the belly of the ally, turn left onto the swarming\
  \ sidewalk, or right onto the steep staircase of hectic BTS sky train. I walk forward\
  \ with confidence and remember that I\u2019m a \u201Clocal.\u201D\n\n7Eleven convenience\
  \ stores stocked with Coca Colas and shinny fish-flavored Thai snacks occupy every\
  \ corner. Makeshift massage parlors are set up on the street as vagabond dogs walk\
  \ alongside suited business men. A hipster coffee shop serving up more Instagram\
  \ photoshoots than lattes neighbors a Palestinian man\u2019s tailor shop. This is\
  \ Bangkok. You have no idea where you\u2019re going, and then, of course your phone\
  \ dies. I remind yourself,\_I live here.\_I don\u2019t even realize I\u2019ve finally\
  \ reached the day that I no longer recognize how hot it is.\n\nReservations are\
  \ in 20 minutes. I keep walking. \n\nI\u2019ve seen it from below. The towering\
  \ mega malls plotted next to slum housing. The shallow sky turning orange through\
  \ the empty spaces between buildings. The old ladies toking their stoves in the\
  \ night market. The motorcycle taxis swarming intersections. I stop in the sidewalk\
  \ and find myself standing below a state building. There are a million people around\
  \ me that you don\u2019t even see. People are rushing into the building\u2014and\
  \ for what? I cannot tell. So, I follow them casually, and get in the elevator to\
  \ the 63rd-floor. \n\nAnd now I\u2019ve seen it from above. As I stand atop what\
  \ seems to be a popular rooftop club, I see Bangkok below me as a knot of\_Pick-Up\
  \ Sticks, spilled into a tangle of highways and canals. The highways weave themselves\
  \ through the stems of skyscrapers, which extend across the horizon into a sort\
  \ of transport matrix. The cars below move in synchronicity, as if a million little\
  \ fireflies are putting on a light show for me. Dinner will have to wait. \nNavigating\
  \ through Bangkok\u2019s contested network of sois, highways, people, skyscrapers,\
  \ mega malls, markets, and rivers has led me to new perspectives. Highways move,\
  \ frantic public transport dizzies the curious traveler, and then, of course, you\
  \ get to where you were intended to be, even if you had other plans in mind. And\
  \ that\u2019s why we travel\u2014to find what we didn\u2019t know we were looking\
  \ for."
