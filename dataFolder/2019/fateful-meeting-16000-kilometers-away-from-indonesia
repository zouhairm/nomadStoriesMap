Text: "Indonesia, as a still developing nation, has its hard-working people who strive\
  \ to have better chance outside motherland. It is not uncommon that some Indonesian\
  \ work in neighboring Asia or Middle-East countries to have better income to feed\
  \ their family. While it is still \u201Cclose\u201D by, I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ I met one on a very unusual \"workplace\", to be exact a country in South America,\
  \ among many other, closer-to-home countries. What a fateful meeting. \n\nFebruary\
  \ 2017, Punta Arenas, Chile. Strong wind of early spring was cold but still bearable.\
  \ Working in a cruise-ship has given me the chance to step on this foreign country.\
  \ Together with other Indonesian crews, we decided to spend our short recess time\
  \ to explore. We took taxi to the city center and shortly arrived at a plaza where\
  \ we were greeted with lush trees standing tall and strong with such lively atmosphere\
  \ of performers and people taking photo at the statue of Ferdinand Magellan. The\
  \ city was full with old style buildings, still intact and fully functioning, locals\
  \ going about their life, the busy streets, it was such a beauty I have never seen\
  \ before.\nSome of my friends wanted to check the infamous cemetery of Punta Arenas.\
  \ It was regarded as one of the most beautiful in the world. Since I was not sure\
  \ where to go and was quite hungry, I decided not to follow them and went third-wheeling\
  \ my other friend and her boyfriend to enjoy the city and have an afternoon tea\
  \ together.\n\nWe decided to try this tiny, very cute looking chocolate shop that\
  \ also doubled as a caf\xE9. It was full house, but we managed to squeeze ourselves\
  \ into a tiny spot available. Hot teas, churros, and sandwich, perfect combination\
  \ to share with friends in this kind of weather. It felt like a tiny picnic, and\
  \ the food was delightful. As we savored the food while chit-chatting, I and my\
  \ fellow Indonesian friend heard something that was very familiar to us: somebody\
  \ was talking in our language! We saw a man resembling Asian people was buying chocolates,\
  \ whom most likely the one who spoke the language. But the thing is, he was not\
  \ talking to his travel mates but to one of the shop staff! \nShocked and unsure\
  \ to what we had witnessed, we kept checking the staff the tourist spoke to earlier.\
  \ She was petite, dark skinned and had long black hair. She is definitely Asian,\
  \ we thought, although still unsure. After we finished the meal and decided to leave,\
  \ we carefully approached the counter and asked her directly: \u201CMiss, are you\
  \ Indonesian?\u201D in Indonesian obviously. \n\nShe cheerfully answered yes and\
  \ we talked for a while, listening to her journey. Her name is Eva, a sweet, funny,\
  \ and very talkative person. We even befriended each other on Facebook right away.\
  \ Since she was still working, we couldn\u2019t chat with her for too long. So glad\
  \ that her boss was really nice and even helped taking picture of us. We parted\
  \ goodbyes and left with heart full of admire for her. For she was a brave, awesome\
  \ woman who is willing to work hard even as far as crossing Pacific Ocean, 16 thousand\
  \ kilometers away from home! South America was not a popular travel destination\
  \ compared to Europe since it was very expensive, yet Eva managed to find her chance\
  \ and doing her best there.\n \nAlthough I did not discover much of the city, but\
  \ I discovered something equally exciting! Adios, Eva! Hopefully someday we will\
  \ meet you again in Punta Arenas, or somewhere in the globe."
