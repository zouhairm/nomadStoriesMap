Text: "I didn\u2019t believe in the supernatural if I had never been to Prague. I\
  \ had always been a pragmatic person, but the moment I stepped on the capital I\
  \ knew there was something different about it. \n\nMaybe it was the brick houses\
  \ in the Old Town that appeared frozen in time or the hundred churches that seemed\
  \ to come out of thin air. But one hot summer afternoon, as I was walking under\
  \ Old Town Bridge Tower, the idea was clear: I was going to find out whether ghosts\
  \ were real or not. Prague, the most haunted city in Europe, was the perfect place.\
  \ \n\nThe opportunity of coming upon otherworldly entities came at night by the\
  \ hand of a cloak-wearing woman called Jasmine, with whom I met at the Church of\
  \ Our Lady before the T\xFDn. My guide carried an old looking lantern which gave\
  \ off a dim light. When confronted about that fact, she said with a gleam of mischief\
  \ in her eyes \u201CWell, then you will have to stay close to me or you will get\
  \ lost, right?\u201D. Then she wrapped herself in the cloak and strolled down the\
  \ street quickly. \n\nSince then till midnight, we wandered around the Czech city\
  \ streets looking for the places that were frequented by ghosts, according to what\
  \ Jasmine was narrating to me. Our first stop, Hastalka Square, had under its foundations\
  \ secrets laboratories used by alchemist who ran all kinds of experiments during\
  \ the Middle Ages. Even with the enchanters having disappeared many centuries ago\
  \ from that place, I felt bewitched by its mystical aura. Sadly, spirits couldn\u2019\
  t be found anywhere.\n\nBefore I realized, we were walking through narrow dark streets\
  \ which were getting emptier the more we penetrated them. At some point during the\
  \ night, I felt as if I had stepped into a grey zone where the barriers of time\
  \ erased and one could go from the Middle Ages to the Velvet Revolution just by\
  \ turning the corner. However, I needed to reconsider my goal, because the only\
  \ frightful things I was running into were stories about humans being vile. Perhaps\
  \ I just had to pay more attention, I thought while we paced around the silent Convent\
  \ of Saint Agnes or a random cul-de-sac.\n\nLater that night, standing in front\
  \ of Na Frantisku, the most ancient hospital in Prague, I dared not to speak a word.\
  \ The shadows that casted on the building\u2019s facade made it seem more tenebrous\
  \ that it already was. The streets, which have been full before with aggressive\
  \ drunkards, emptied. It felt as we were waiting for something of unexplainable\
  \ nature to come out rushing of the stone building. Had I finally found what I was\
  \ looking for?\n\nSuddenly, I wished to walk away from that place, but we weren\u2019\
  t moving: she just stood there, with her lantern, completely quiet. I was scared\
  \ to death, but of what? What was scaring me to my core? I couldn\u2019t see nothing,\
  \ it was way too dark, so what could be making me react like that? As my heart raced\
  \ one thought crossed my mind: that was it. I was about to confront a supernatural\
  \ being and I couldn\u2019t do nothing to stop it. \n\nBut the minutes went by and\
  \ nothing happened. Nothing came out of the darkness. The streets seemed to crowd\
  \ with people and their noisiness again. Eventually, I calmed down and tried to\
  \ reason what had just happened. \n\nThen I understood.  \n\nIt was Jasmine. It\
  \ had been her all this time. The realization hit me like a ton of bricks as we\
  \ approached our starting point. She had been so passionate about the stories that\
  \ I had almost believed them. \n\nThe Astronomical Clock guarded over us while we\
  \ said goodbye. I could tell by her cheerful expression that she knew the effect\
  \ she had caused in me. I pretended I didn\u2019t see it and we parted.\n\nAs soon\
  \ as I alone, I reflected on what had just happened. I concluded that maybe I hadn\u2019\
  t found ghosts, but I had gotten to know what happened when oneself put passion\
  \ in life. And that was something I would never stop searching for."
