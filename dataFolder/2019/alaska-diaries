Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s gonna be easier for you to find a ride with a sign. People\
  \ will pick you up faster if they know when they can get rid of you again.\u201D\
  \ Twirl laughs out loud. \nHe lived in Girdwood his entire life, did a fair amount\
  \ of hitchhiking himself, he tells me just shortly after I got into his car. He\
  \ was the first person who stopped and picked me up on the highway just outside\
  \ Anchorage on my trip to Homer, a little fishing town on the Southern end of Alaska.\
  \ He has worked almost every job out there, became rich by selling weed when it\
  \ still was illegal, spent most of his time skiing and eventually opened up a souvenir\
  \ shop. The drive from Anchorage to Girdwood is like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen\
  \ before, glaciers and majestic mountains rising abruptly and steep along the shores\
  \ of the Turnagain Arm. \n\n\u201CPretty girl like you shouldn\u2019t be waiting\
  \ too long. Good luck.\u201D I hand him back his pen, smile at him and grab my sign.\
  \ Carrying it proud like my armor, holding onto it like my lifejacket, I step out\
  \ of the store. The wind is brutal, hurting my skin as soon as it hits my face.\
  \ Car after car flies by. I take my backpack off.  The wind is so cold that I stopped\
  \ feeling my fingers shortly after I left the warmth and safety of Twirl\u2019s\
  \ store. The sign is useless, being bent out of shape from the wind and the slowly\
  \ starting rain. I sigh. Hitchhiking is one of the most ambivalent experiences to\
  \ go through- feeding your frustration with every car that doesn\u2019t stop, making\
  \ you more desperate for even just the shortest ride, redeeming you from the cold,\
  \ getting you closer to your destination, making you realize why you\u2019re putting\
  \ yourself out there, right next to the street. \nThe window of a brand new sports\
  \ car comes down. \u201CYou going to Homer?\u201D Dennis asks me, reading the sign\
  \ I\u2019m holding in my hands. \u201CAre you?\u201D He smiles and gets out of the\
  \ car. He\u2019s wearing cowboy boots. Not exactly what I would\u2019ve expected\
  \ in Alaska. Maybe I\u2019m just thinking in clich\xE9. I open the door and country\
  \ music is playing. Maybe not clich\xE9 after all. \nThe drive from Girdwood to\
  \ Homer seems like a stroll through outdoor heaven. We continue on the coastal road\
  \ of the Kenai peninsula, watching the waves crash on the beaches of the Cook Inlet\
  \ on our right, admiring breathtaking high mountains, dark green forests and wildly\
  \ running rivers providing the bears main food source, salmon, on the left.  \n\
  We stop once to save a dog that was hit by a car. Another time to look at a dead\
  \ moose that was hit by a car. State law in Alaska obligates people to harvest the\
  \ meat of a hit moose on the spot, making it a food donation to poor families in\
  \ the nearest community. \nDennis tells me about his job, one of the best surgeons\
  \ in the country, his family, two angel kids and a beautiful wife, his hunting trips,\
  \ private pilot, and shares anecdotes about tourists being afraid of bears. \n\u201C\
  Bears don\u2019t have mirrors. They don\u2019t know how big they are. As long as\
  \ you can stand your ground, nothing will happen to you. Unless they\u2019re with\
  \ their cubs, then you lose.\u201D A lesson I\u2019ll later learn to highly appreciate.\
  \ \nI learn everything and nothing about Dennis on our four hour drive. He spends\
  \ a couple of hundred dollars on buying me bear spray, pepper spray and hiking food.\
  \ \u201CPretty girl like you has to be careful. It\u2019s a dangerous world out\
  \ there.\u201D \n\nHe drops me off at the address I gave him.\nThe smell of freshly\
  \ grilled fish salmon lies in the air. \nMaybe it\u2019s the lure of adventure,\
  \ maybe it\u2019s knowing that you\u2019re absolutely depending on a stranger\u2019\
  s kindness, that keeps dragging me to roadsides around the world, but people will\
  \ definitely always pick you up as long as they know, when they can get rid of you\
  \ again."
