Text: "81 kilometers from Yopal, the capital of Casanare, the air smells intensely\
  \ of cattle and the horizon looks clean and infinite. There are no more traces of\
  \ the city, it is just the countryside. The Andes mountain has ended up becoming\
  \ in a plain in a place where all its population preserves the tradition of the\
  \ \u2018llanera\u2019 culture in its rural lifestyle.\n\nSome cattles came running\
  \ after hearing the voice of Mr Jos\xE9 Ordo\xF1ez, who on a horse, and singing\
  \ without fatigue, stepped forward before he crossed the growing river in a warm\
  \ weather winter in Casanare. Although some of them went astray, they were overtaken\
  \ by the whistles of other workers who caught them with a lasso and returned them\
  \ to their destination in the river.\n\nFor Mr Jos\xE9 Ordo\xF1ez, a barefoot llanero\
  \ with a big hat, plaid shirt and gray hair, his soul shudders every time he sings\
  \ to the cattle and it responds. He was born in a small place of the department\
  \ called Man\xED (without referring to the snack), where he learned as a child a\
  \ unique tradition of the Colombia and Venezuela plains. Now, he is one of the few\
  \ men that keeps it alives.\n\n\nFrom early morning, before the rooster crows and\
  \ the sun begins to paint the sky of colors, the plain workers prepare the songs\
  \ to milk the cows, to lower the horses, to march with the cattle and to take it\
  \ to the paddock. The animals surprisingly recognize them by their voice and easily\
  \ access to the jobs which they are subjected.\n\n\n\nOlder adults, like Mr Jos\xE9\
  \ Ordo\xF1ez, are the ones who know this type of songs that also speak about romantic\
  \ disappointments and lovers. For other plain workers, those songs and whistles\
  \ aside to facilitate the work with the cattle, conserve the memory and, for years,\
  \ they have constructed the image of the \u2018llanero\u2019 and its life in the\
  \ plain. For example, when Mr Jos\xE9 prepares to sing he always looks at the horizon,\
  \ with his watery eyes, and raises his chest, so that his best voice comes out.\n\
  \n\n\nDue to the armed conflict with the Farc, the departments of Casanare, Meta\
  \ and Arauca, where the \u2018llanera\u2019 culture belongs, the destination was\
  \ not frequented by tourists. However, this unexplored zone of Colombia conserves\
  \ its own ecosystem and a unique diverse fauna that has no other place, such as\
  \ chig\xFCiros, birds, deer and wild species.\n\nIn the vast plains, hundreds of\
  \ cattle are seen day by day walking in the sunlight. On these there is no type\
  \ of delimitation, so the cattle are easily lost and mixed with the cattle of the\
  \ neighbors. For this reason, men like Mr Jos\xE9 Ordo\xF1ez learned from their\
  \ masters and consolidated their own songs and whistles to look for the animals\
  \ and bring them back to their farms. \n\nLong, with voice breaks and always with\
  \ the same sense, the songs of plain work are not so well known today. They were\
  \ declared at the end of 2017 as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by Unesco,\
  \ however, Mr Jos\xE9 and his colleagues are concerned and saddened because a few\
  \ years later this tradition, which was born approximately 200 years ago, has been\
  \ lost and it is in danger of disappearing.\n\nCustoms have changed and now the\
  \ cattle move by truck and walk on the pavement. Mr Jos\xE9 said that the tradition\
  \ has deteriorated in the last 15 years, because the owners and precursors of it\
  \ have died and new generations have been interested in other things such as urban\
  \ life and the Internet.\n\nBut nevertheless, the llaneros are trying to bring more\
  \ tourists and tell them their stores, that are unique in Colombia. For the moment,\
  \ each sunrise and sunset will continue to be accompanied by the voices of those\
  \ men who preserve a great knowledge that the new generations must know. The singing\
  \ of plain workers are about distance, for the road, to go to adventure, for the\
  \ open space, for the trip of your life."
