Text: 'As my story title Vroom with a view: "IN SEARCH OF BEAUTIFUL FRIEND"  there
  is a story behind this I am AIESECER we calling people to work here I was the member
  in IGV we are worked on SDGS in that project so people came here to contribute yourself
  in social issues so, that time 2 girls came here in Jaipur from Portugal the first
  time I saw them into the Airport and we talked a lot in that period of time then
  the story begins they had been for 45 days in India those 45 days are the best days
  in my life because of them we did everything we travelled whole of India in those
  45 days and we did many things on that trip I can''t explain the whole thing in
  that paragraph in the last 45 days completed now time for saying bye but at that
  stage I am very attached to them and I can''t see them when they are leaving but
  in the end  I went airport and we three are cried a lot everyone is watched us but
  I didn''t regret because I know God give that oppournity to meet them again and
  then I saw this oppournity I just applied fot it....Being a wanderlust it''s a great
  opportunity for me That''s all my true why I applied for this opportunity and if
  I am selected then my dream come true because I love travelling apart from this
  I love blogging.'
