Text: "He was looking at her from the other side of the room, that day the Christmas\
  \ lights hanging on the ceiling flooded the room with a warm color, there were people\
  \ everywhere, some talking, others dancing and others just they shared a cigar,\
  \ while the night fell the sound of music was lost among the voices, she danced\
  \ to the music and sang as if she wanted everyone to hear her, her hair  jumped\
  \ from one side to the other and he approached her to try to keep up with her, but\
  \ she was like a tornado, circling in the room and he was that moment of calm before\
  \ any storm, they weren\u2019t compatible. The party seemed not to finish, but he\
  \ had to leave, he approached her to say goodbye and she could notice the red color\
  \ that flooded his cheeks when he was drunk, but she didn\u2019t care because she\
  \ drinked too, they looked at each other and deep down the two of them wanted to\
  \ get closer and give themselves the kiss they had expected so much, but maybe the\
  \ moment was not right, the crowded room was not exactly the most romantic place,\
  \ so they just said goodbye, a few minutes later she went to the entrance of the\
  \ place and something what she didn\u2019t expect, happened, he had returned to\
  \ steal a kiss, there she was standing right at the entrance of the place and holding\
  \ the door, as he slowly approached her to kiss her, it was a good kiss, unhurried,\
  \ slow and tender, in the end the two smiled and he left.\nIt was a January 18 when\
  \ she knew that he would go on a trip to Rome and maybe he would not see him, the\
  \ destiny wanted them  together, because that same week she would go to Rome with\
  \ her friends, he told her - come to Rome - and she only said -tomorrow- and that's\
  \ how 24 hours later, she was flying to Rome.\nRome seemed like a magical place,\
  \ just seeing the coliseum, walking through all the streets with ruins and knowing\
  \ that each place keeps so many stories was simply amazing. The night came, the\
  \ sky had been painted a dark blue, it seemed that the stars had disappeared to\
  \ leave all the sky to the moon, because that day the moon shone like never before.\
  \ They saw each other outside the pantheon of Rome, they decided to go for dinner,\
  \ so they walked to a cafe in front of the coliseum, the cafe had a decoration with\
  \ yellow led lights which made contrast with the stone walls, they dined together,\
  \ all talked and laughed and she could only think about how magical that moment\
  \ was. He was sitting right in front of her, and he saw her in a very special way,\
  \ telling her that she looked beautiful and she just smiled at him and thanked him,\
  \ but deep down she wanted to scream with emotion.\nWhen they left the place the\
  \ cold air hit them in the face, the moon was still shining like never before and\
  \ right behind them was the coliseum that stood imposing, they decided to stand\
  \ right in the corner of the cafeteria and after saying goodbye to everyone, they\
  \ decided to leave them alone a few minutes, the two approached, they took each\
  \ other's hands and began to kiss, neither of them had to say anything, at that\
  \ moment Rome had become their favorite place, they kissed slowly, they smiled,\
  \ she caressed his face and he looked her in the eyes, after a few minutes they\
  \ started talking and they said they would never forget, now she would go back to\
  \ Mexico and he to Korea, all this went through their minds and made it even harder\
  \ to say goodbye, the tears were about to get out when they decided to say goodbye,\
  \ they gave each other a last kiss and slowly they went away until there was nothing\
  \  more in the memory of the streets of Rome, just a remind of an impossible love."
