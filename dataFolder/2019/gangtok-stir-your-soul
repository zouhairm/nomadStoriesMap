Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s called Switzerland of India\u201D, our cab driver bragged about\
  \ his hometown, Gangtok, while I giggled how the places are exaggerated and compared\
  \ with foreign countries. What I didn\u2019t know then was, how much truth his exaggeration\
  \ held.\n\nGangtok is the capital of the mountainous northern Indian state, Sikkim.\
  \ It has been established as a Buddhist site in the 1840s. A city that will win\
  \ your heart with its warm people, and cold weather. I am an Indian, hence I understand\
  \ how much other Indians are capable of fooling the tourists, but not in Gangtok.\
  \ East-India has an aura of warmth and honesty flowing with the wind of Buddhist\
  \ flags.\n\nMy journey for Gangtok began from flying from Pune to Kolkata and meeting\
  \ my first love, Saksham in Kolkata. The same day we had a train to Hasimara, and\
  \ we were supposed to reach Phuentsholling the next morning, grab our entry permits\
  \ to Bhutan and start exploring Bhutan. Yes, you read that right. We planned to\
  \ visit Bhutan, and not Gangtok. Fate led us to Gangtok, since the immigration office\
  \ was closed due to the King\u2019s birthday and since a weekend followed it, we\
  \ couldn\u2019t get our entry permit for 4 more days. Hence, we decided to take\
  \ a U-turn and explore my unexplored part of India instead.\n\nSo we went to Siliguri,\
  \ West Bengal and stayed in a not-so-nice hotel for the night, to get up early in\
  \ the morning and leave for Gangtok. The best part of any trip is its journey, and\
  \ in our case it was the ghats with the scenic view of mountains, and a cab driver\
  \ who thought he was driving a roller-coaster instead of a jeep.\n\nTill the time\
  \ we reached hotel, my ass had completely gone numb, and I gave it a pity by lying\
  \ on the bed-made-in-heaven. I started jumping on the bed, with Saksham getting\
  \ embarrassed by the noise I was creating by not doing the naughty things that our\
  \ neighbors were imagining we would be doing.\n\nHere started our first day at Gangtok.\n\
  \nI have had my fascination with the monks, and monasteries and their rich culture,\
  \ hence leading us to our first tourist spot, Enchey Monastery. When we reached\
  \ there, we passed an under-construction plot, and 3 monks who seemed bored by the\
  \ tourists.\n\nWhen we entered the monastery, it seemed like an art to me. The walls\
  \ were painted in angry masks of demons demonstrating the rage inside human beings.\
  \ It was magical at once, but strange after a second thought. Why would monasteries\
  \ encourage rage and aggressive behaviour of humankind when they strive for peace?\
  \ The answer lies in facing it, instead of running from it. It\u2019s fascinating\
  \ how silence becomes your best friend inside a holy place, and your soul takes\
  \ over your materialistic temptations.\n\nTsomgo/Changu Lake. Our tourist spot for\
  \ the next day. I have played in ice in Kashmir, but never had I witnessed the beauty\
  \ of ice like I did in Gangtok. Imagine, you head out from a usual looking hill-station\
  \ and the roads take you to a destination no less than heaven.\n\nAs Saksham took\
  \ snaps of white mountains and ice-covered roads, I blinked my eyes and captured\
  \ those eternally in my mind. It felt like the mountains had adopted small white\
  \ children and they grew adult and made their own colonies as the height ascended.\
  \ In the end, everyone lived happily ever after, until the demon of global warming\
  \ came to destroy these colonies.\n\nWhen our journey by road ended to the freezing\
  \ place filled with small huts covered with ice, and yaks, we warmed ourselves with\
  \ a hot cup of tea, hired boots, and later regretted not purchasing a pair of gloves.\
  \ The road to ice took us to throwing ice balls at each other, and let hypothermia\
  \ take over our bodies. When we started turning into ice, we decided to descend\
  \ down to our hotel to our best friend of the day, blankets."
