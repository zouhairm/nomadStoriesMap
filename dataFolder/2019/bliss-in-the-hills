Text: "\u201CHello, dad! We have reached our camp. Yes, the place is nice and warm.\
  \ Don\u2019t worry we will take care of ourselves. Goodnight.\u201D \nI was shouting\
  \ in front of a 5ft pole which held a Nokia 1100 mobile phone tied on it with aluminum\
  \ wire. It was the first evening of our honeymoon. Manoj ji had arranged this unique\
  \ telephone system because, that was the ONLY spot which could connect to a network\
  \ during the winters in the Alpine Adventure Camp in Dugalbitta, Chopta. Middle-aged\
  \ Manoj Ji ( in Hindi \u201CJi\u201D is added to show respect) was a wizard who\
  \ managed and mended everything at the camp with a smile, be it the frozen water\
  \ pipes or the tough mutton pieces in dinner. He was the manager, housekeeper, cook,\
  \ and guide for the guests, where Manik and I were to spend the next 48 hours of\
  \ our honeymoon. \nThe whiff of cardamom flavored hot chai (milk tea) was enough\
  \ to get us out of our cozy bed, the next morning. As I stepped out of our tent\
  \ my feet immersed deep into the bed of snow that accumulated after the early morning\
  \ precipitation. Dugalbitta wrapped in white was calling out to us. \n \nLocated\
  \ at the height of nearly 2600 meters above sea level, it is a part of Kedarnath\
  \ Wildlife Sanctuary in the state of Uttarakhand in northern India. It is quite\
  \ a hot-spot for trekkers as plenty of destinations are dotted around this small\
  \ hamlet like Deoriataal, Tunganath, Chandrsheela, and Kedarnath (affected by the\
  \ 2013 cloudburst). \n\nAfter a quick breakfast, we were ready for a romantic walk.\
  \ Manoj ji warned us about the unpredictable weather and asked us to remember him\
  \ if any problem arises. I thought it was funny as in no dire situation could we\
  \ contact him as our phones were out of coverage area but still smiled and left.\n\
  \ We wandered on the snow-covered road which was now off limits to automobiles.\
  \ There was no crowd, no pollution, no chaos but just the two of us. It was a happy\
  \ place, a bliss!\n\nAfter plenty of snowball throws and goofing around, we went\
  \ down a trail to reach a tiny deserted village in the meadows encircled by junipers\
  \ and deodars facing the mighty \u2018Choukhabma\u201D of Garwhal Himalayas.\nAll\
  \ the houses were vacant, the cattle shed was empty, even the Hanuman (The Monkey\
  \ Lord) Temple was under lock and key. We knew people from the remote village move\
  \ to the plain to avoid harsh winter, even the deities from the mountain temples\
  \ are taken along. It was kind of surreal and eerie. The trees whispered in the\
  \ wind, and the mountain breeze brushed our face. We noticed that the clouds had\
  \ started to gather behind the peaks. Though it was still bright and sunny, we remembered,\
  \ what Manoj had said. We decided to walk back to the camp. That is when we saw\
  \ pug-marks of some canine on the snow. The wind was becoming strong, and so we\
  \ paced back, all of a sudden our romantic walk was not the same anymore. We were\
  \ worried, unarmed, and then it started drizzling. We heard soft footsteps by the\
  \ turning of the road. Scared, we braced ourselves; but to our relief, it was Manoj\
  \ Ji. The man had told me that he believed in the concept of \u201CAtithi Devo Bhava,\u201D\
  \ (\u201Cguest is God\u201D) so he does everything to keep his God happy and safe.\
  \ I would not have believed it unless I saw him with two umbrellas looking for us\
  \ in the middle of nowhere. We told him about the pug mark, and he showed us his\
  \ kukri knife. However, the canine did not appear, but the clouds did and hid the\
  \ sun. We luckily made to the camp in time without getting drenched thus avoiding\
  \ a pneumonia attack. All thanks to Manoj Ji the rest of our honeymoon went on as\
  \ planned.\n\nTourists might be equivalent to God for him, but people like Manoj\
  \ Ji definitely are God sent who welcomes travelers with open arms and a smile.\
  \ They stop at nothing to gift us that one memorable vacation which we cherish for\
  \ life."
