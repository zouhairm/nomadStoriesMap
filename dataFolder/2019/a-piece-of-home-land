Text: "In the beginning I was abroad. That\u2019s how my \u201Cadult\u201D life started.\
  \ I was done with my BA degree (in Athens) and now I had to find something to do.\
  \ Outside Greece. So, it started nomadically.\n\n   Needless to say, it can be inundating,\
  \ that feeling of knowing that you have left without any prospects of returning\
  \ any time soon. So, yeah, I was abroad doing a short course in a manor house in\
  \ the outskirts of Forres, a tiny village in Scotland. Being used to living in a\
  \ flat or a simple house, I was out of my comfort zone. I\u2019d both travelled\
  \ and lived abroad before. Yet in those days, I wanted to spend more and more time\
  \ outside as if the restlessness of what\u2019s around me, of the world moving,\
  \ of life building, hadn\u2019t been enough so far. \n\n   One morning I was on\
  \ an early walk in the gardens and there was a moment that resonated. It was summer\
  \ and everything was putting its best self out there, as if it was trying to impress\
  \ me. Even the weather. It was going to be a sunny day. I was walking alone out\
  \ of the path and into my thoughts, not pondering over anything specific. But when\
  \ I first smelled them, my head snapped around, and I was sniffing about, trying\
  \ to find them. An old woman, one of the house\u2019s caretakers, had washed their\
  \ beddings, and they were hanging them on a wire out to dry. I offered to help.\
  \ I knew her from doing other household chores with her.\n\n   The two sheets she\
  \ had put up there were beating on the breeze, fresh and blessed with cleanliness.\
  \ She told me I could help and I jumped on the task. I did it smiling the entire\
  \ time. \n\n   \u2018Well, you look really content. Maybe you\u2019d like to do\
  \ the rest of my laundry, eh?\u2019 she joked, pointing at me. I didn\u2019t even\
  \ blush or hide the smile.\n\n   \u2018If it smells that fresh,\u2019 I joked at\
  \ that moment, but my heart and mind were pulled back in memory. Back in Greece,\
  \ this had been a chore for me. Here in Scotland, it was a chance to recall for\
  \ a moment.\n\n   We talked, the two of us for a while, and then she went on with\
  \ her other errands, leaving me alone in front of the drying bedsheets which rose\
  \ and swirled in the breeze, like dancing costumes with no dancers inside them.\
  \ They would dry under the sun, to get that toasty feeling a home has; a warm, inviting\
  \ one.\n\n   I stood there still smiling without minding it, remembering moments\
  \ without realising it, living both in the past and the present at that moment.\
  \ This was something familiar, something personal, something coming from my home.\
  \ And I had found it there, in Scotland, so unbelievably far away.\n\n   I took\
  \ a deep breath and I stretched out my hands, as wide as I could, stretched like\
  \ the sheets. They were still beating and dancing; like sails of an immobile ship;\
  \ like dancing outfits without dancers in them. It didn\u2019t matter if I wasn\u2019\
  t going back, perhaps ever again.\n\n   There would always be something of what\
  \ I had left behind waiting for me where I would go. The bedsheets dance in the\
  \ same manner in Scotland as they do in Greece.\nI had to accept that and be willing\
  \ to focus on the present, rather than whining about the past. I\u2019m still away\
  \ from my home, without many prospects of going back. But every now and then, I\
  \ get to live a moment like that one, in that garden, in Forres. Every now and then\
  \ I get that freshness and that breeze in my own sails. And it keeps making me smile,\
  \ unknowingly and unapologetically. And it keeps me going."
