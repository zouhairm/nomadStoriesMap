Text: "First, there was something. And then there was nothing.\n\nThe incessant clicking\
  \ of my camera abruptly stopped as I realized that my finger on the shutter had\
  \ yet again gone on autopilot. My surrounding was nothing short of dull. For a place\
  \ buzzling with life due to its reputation as an essential for tourists, Kota Tua\
  \ presented itself as near lifeless. Its historical buildings stood stiff as thousands\
  \ of visitors made them as mere backdrops for their personal aesthetic endeavor,\
  \ the cobbled ground that once carried the weight of stomping feet during the age\
  \ of colonialism helplessly endured the harsh impact of skateboard wheels. Meanwhile,\
  \ local and foreign visitors alike immersed themselves in touristic euphoria and\
  \ took what the neighborhood offered for granted. Everyone wanted to tell stories\
  \ of how they had visited Kota Tua, but nobody wanted to hear stories of how Kota\
  \ Tua came to be. Standing at the main plaza of Kota Tua, right at the heart of\
  \ it, the idle bustle around me left me aimless and numb.\n\nAt that moment, I felt\
  \ a tap on my shoulder and turned around. There stood a man who looked like he was\
  \ well in his eighties. In contrast to the tourists donning summer clothes and weightless\
  \ thoughts, this man was supporting tattered clothes and a bent back weighed by\
  \ a trash sack. \u201CTake a picture of me!\u201D he had excitedly exclaimed before\
  \ striking a pose (a classic peace sign). I fumbled with the camera I had left hanging\
  \ from my neck and quickly took several photos of him. He then proceeded to show\
  \ me a picture of his wife, the reason he was there that day. In fact, he was there\
  \ everyday, he told me. To fulfill the basic needs of his family, he had to pick\
  \ up litters that would later be sold, \u201C\u2013so that at night I would come\
  \ home to my lovely wife bringing money!\u201D\n\nHome, to him, was Kota Tua. He\
  \ was born and raised there, the house he now resided in with his wife had been\
  \ the same one he had lived in his entire life. He laughed as he joked about how\
  \ his house was as stubborn and strong as him, the both of them standing through\
  \ all the changes Kota Tua had undergone as it faced modernization. Albeit brusquely,\
  \ I asked why he had chosen to stay in a town mostly known for its old histories\
  \ and what was left from the past. \u201CContrary to its name, Kota Tua is not old,\
  \ and I believe it never will be,\u201D he had answered with another laugh. To him,\
  \ Kota Tua\u2019s history served as a fuel for people to produce new stories, and\
  \ then those stories would lead to other new stories. \u201CKota Tua was never just\
  \ an area that stood still as old history and a leftover of the past; it overlooked\
  \ the people of many presents who each carried their own story and constantly breathed\
  \ life into the neighborhood.\u201D His words made me reflect on my dismissal earlier\
  \ over Kota Tua. I could only waved timidly as he walked away humming about missing\
  \ his wife and looking forward to going home, his trash sack on his retreating back.\
  \ As soon as I was able to collect myself, I held my camera firmly, having found\
  \ a new perspective to capture Kota Tua.\n\nKota Tua was a place of serene antiquity\
  \ that carried whispered stories from days past, but it was also filled with joyful\
  \ laughter and lively conversations of the present people. Merchants hung their\
  \ portraits and paintings, displayed their handmade bracelets and necklaces, carried\
  \ around their rainbow paper-pinwheels and balloons for the children to buy, all\
  \ adding vibrant colors to desaturating wall paints along with the flowers that\
  \ bloomed between the cracks on brick walls. There were as much local natives as\
  \ there were foreign tourists, busily interacting and blending harmoniously with\
  \ the background that held an equally significant multicultural value. The incessant\
  \ clicking of my camera captured Kota Tua as it loomed over the people, overlooking\
  \ and holding on to their stories.  \n\nFirst, there was something. And then there\
  \ was everything."
