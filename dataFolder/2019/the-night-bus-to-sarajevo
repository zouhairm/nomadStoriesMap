Text: "Suddenly, I was awake by someone sitting by my side. I greeted the man with\
  \ a smile that led him to dig his bag and get a small bottle, which he handed me.\
  \ Then he got another bottle, removed the cap and gulped at once; I did the same\
  \ and was immediately on fire. We became instant friends. \n\t\u201CLoza, good!\u201D\
  , he said emphatically.\n\tI agreed. He proceeded to talk and drink at a pace I\
  \ never thought was humanly possible. I could not understand a word, not because\
  \ his mouth performed two operations at the same time but because I do not speak\
  \ his language. All I could do was look at him with a smiling face and help him\
  \ drink his endless supply of loza, which proved this is a man who knows how to\
  \ travel.\n\tHis sentences were becoming longer and louder as his companions became\
  \ curious to see who was at the receiving end of the monologue and then bewildered\
  \ by my presence there. Two girls behind me volunteered to translate his words and\
  \ a conversation ensued. I learned that they were Bosnian lumberjacks going home\
  \ after working in Montenegro. As his attention moved from my face to the girls,\
  \ I got to look at him better. He was young and had short but strong hands, and\
  \ his fingers had the cuts and bruises typical of the brutal work. I realized that\
  \ he was drinking his poverty, his loneliness, his circular present, away. \nIn\
  \ the seat after me, my friend was trying desperately to sleep, but now the Bosnians\
  \ and I were a small party singing songs I did not know the lyrics to or telling\
  \ jokes I could not laugh of by myself. We were having a wonderful time, but my\
  \ friend was cursing the day he decided to travel with me.\n\tAfter crawling up\
  \ the spiraling road, the bus stopped at a gas station. Everybody entered the caf\xE9\
  \ to have a coffee and smoke, but my friend was dizzy by the smell of alcohol and\
  \ the winding path. All I could do was watch helplessly while he threw up and lay\
  \ motionless in the ground. \n\tI went to the caf\xE9 to fetch him some water and\
  \ the lumberjacks yelled at my entry through the thick nicotine fog. They sensed\
  \ something was wrong and came to my assistance.  One of them ran to the bus and\
  \ brought an aspirin that my friend only swallowed out of politeness. It took him\
  \ five minutes to recover, but he was not in position to see the irony in being\
  \ saved by his tormentors. \n\tThe man resumed his frenzied conversation while pointing\
  \ to me and then to himself. I understood the word \u201Cclock\u201D and then realized\
  \ he wanted my watch. I was about to give it to him when another lumberjack told\
  \ me not to. Then he talked to the man as if giving him a hard time. Everything\
  \ was quiet for a while; then the man pointed to my watch and his brother reprimanded\
  \ him again. And again. And again.\n\tBy the umpteenth time it happened, a girl\
  \ roared from the other side of the bus. I turned my head surprised that someone\
  \ could find amusement in my plight; she was staring at me with a questioning face\
  \ \u2013 perhaps bewildered by my presence there. I was saved by the booze: soon\
  \ the guy was snoring by my side. I checked my friend and he was asleep, so I moved\
  \ to a seat by her side.\n\tIn English, she told me she was also going back home\
  \ after a stint waiting tables in Croatia. \u201CEverybody is going home after the\
  \ tourist season\u201D, she said. Next, the subject was me. I told her my nationality\
  \ and she roared one more time. \u201CNobody is going to believe when I tell that\
  \ I had a conversation in the bus with a Brazilian\u201D. It felt like I was proving\
  \ that Brazil really exists.\n\tThen we arrived at Sarajevo. My friend looked terrible\
  \ as we got off the bus and I was sorry for him, but not for long: later that day,\
  \ he would meet his wife."
