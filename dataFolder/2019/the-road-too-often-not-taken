Text: "It\u2019s hard to write a story of life changing, incomprehensible travel when\
  \ you\u2019ve barely left your home country. I chose to write a simplar story, one\
  \ that involves a 1600km car trip south from my rural home town in Northern New\
  \ South Wales to the big smoke of Australia\u2019s most cultural city. It was an\
  \ uncertain 5am discussion between the other passengers and I, as to which route\
  \ to take on our extensive two day drive to reach our now home- Melbourne. You see\
  \ there are three main routes you find when offering yourself to google maps. The\
  \ first, an eastern- part coastal pacific highway taking you through Sydney- one\
  \ we had all endured many times. The second, a slightly more inland version that\
  \ ever so slightly takes you around Australia\u2019s capital city, then the third,\
  \ an inland route to which many would too often not travel. We chose the latter,\
  \ and in our naivity had no idea the sights we would see, roads we would encounter\
  \ and people we would meet. And so our journey began, the first few hours being\
  \ a familiar breeze. I rest my head against the inside of the car door, sleepily\
  \ watching the terrain blur past, all sights I had seen before. Until we hit the\
  \ crossroads saying goodbye to the familiar highway and head directly west. At this\
  \ time in the world, climate change is an every day encounter that is harrowing\
  \ us all, believers or not. The devastations in Australia so recently include a\
  \ sweltering drought plaguing the inland and to our knowledge was bad, but was worse\
  \ than we had imagined. The inland route took us on a strange journey, being one\
  \ of the three main routes we enticipated straight highways, instead we encountered\
  \ gravel roads, sparking dismay to the director (myself) by the driver. As we all\
  \ look at each other and utter confusion, we chuckle in an uncertain way, then focus\
  \ ourselves back to the road and surroundings. On these roads we found ourselves\
  \ going over multiple poorly signed cattle grates, in which we realsised was us\
  \ entering and exiting through farmed properties. We were all used to swaying to\
  \ miss grazing livestock and screeching brakes on uneven gravel roads, but the unfamiliarity\
  \ of this landscape was puzzling, and more to our dismay the work of the drought\
  \ we were seeing in full effect. Cobblestone valleys where water surely once flowed\
  \ now empty, much skinnier looking animals, dry stalky grass covering rolling hills\
  \ that in no way made us want to embrace our inner child and sled down, forests\
  \ of trees showing scars where rapid fire tore through, and relentless sun with\
  \ no shady pockets to offer any protection to those in the fields. But through we\
  \ passed until we found hit our over night destination. Our phone batteries all\
  \ running extremely low, we booked the cheapest motel in an old shearing town called\
  \ Collector that seemed to be stuck in some sort of time warp. The motel, surely\
  \ haunted offered us an unexpected room for four in what was definitely the attic,\
  \ just slightly converted. Our stop over was easy, beer, rest, wake up, coffee and\
  \ back on the road. The second half of the journey went fast, to which we indulged\
  \ in more frequently in pee breaks, unnesscary food stops and many other harmless\
  \ however incriminating activities. As the day dragged on and Melbourne became closer\
  \ in sight, we spoke of the first day, full of confusion, sadness, great music and\
  \ memories that will last forever. I think the best part of the journey was realising\
  \ that travel doesn\u2019t have to involve crossing oceans and planes. It involves\
  \ taking in the environment around you, whether it\u2019s sitting on a tram on the\
  \ way to work or cycling to your friends house, finding things you should have seen\
  \ every journey but have only now realised but more importantly, learning the impact\
  \ we have on the environment we wish to travel. Because if there were no land to\
  \ travel, explore and experience, what would travel involve?"
