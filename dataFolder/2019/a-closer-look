Text: "The baby-milk ladies annoyed me to no end. They would stand outside the convenience\
  \ stores in my neighborhood, incessantly tapping the shoulder of whoever had the\
  \ misfortune of walking past, saying \"milk, baby, baby, milk, buying milk for my\
  \ baby\" and pointing at the convenience store. \n       The first time I saw this\
  \ was in Kolkata, India. It distressed me then; I yearned to help and knew I couldn't.\
  \ Dozens of cities later, though, I found myself much more jaded. By the time I\
  \ settled down in Kathmandu, Nepal, I'd seen it all before. I knew that the milk\
  \ wasn't really for the baby, knew they would just return it to the shop as soon\
  \ as I left and collect the money, knew that half the time the babies were just\
  \ borrowed from a friend for the purpose of this clever stunt. Once, I stopped to\
  \ furiously lecture one of the ladies on how immoral it was to treat a baby like\
  \ this, to allow a baby to spend its early years as a puppet on the street. She\
  \ spoke English, but the concept of morality seemed to escape her completely. She\
  \ just kept asking me for milk.  I was livid.\n       Then a friend introduced me\
  \ to Bimla, one of the baby-milk ladies. Bimla invited my friend and me to her house.\
  \ Intrigued, I followed, followed as she led us across the busy main road with its\
  \ mishmash of vehicles and people and animals, followed as she led us down a hill\
  \ with a narrow path to a quiet area with a sizable slum. Bimla greeted her neighbors\
  \ as she walked by. Children dashed in and out around us as they played in this\
  \ strange oasis of squalor and calm. Bimla's house was a sort of part-tent, part-tin\
  \ structure containing a bed frame with a piece of plywood on top and a camping\
  \ stove in the corner. As she made us some paratha (a type of bread) and some delicious\
  \ spiced chai tea, we sat and chatted with her and her husband like we would have\
  \ with any other friend--about life, children, the weather, whatever. At that moment,\
  \ Bimla became three-dimensional for me. I understood at once that she was just\
  \ another human making her way through the world in whichever way she knew how.\
  \ With a pang of guilt I realized that her job was not the only job that involves\
  \ some aspect of taking advantage of others; indeed many more conventional jobs\
  \ could be viewed as equally unethical--but I don't condemn sleazy salespeople with\
  \ quite the same moral superiority as I had been condemning the baby-milk ladies.\
  \ \n       Having that experience with Bimla helped me to recognize the humanity\
  \ in others I viewed in a two-dimensional way, too. I used to feel so bad for the\
  \ beggars, for example, attributing to them simple personas made up of just grief\
  \ and suffering. There was the old man with the raggedy clothes and twinkling eyes,\
  \ a character in my mental drama to whom I would always give five rupees. Then a\
  \ friend of mine reported having seen him changing from normal clothes into \"begging\
  \ clothes\"...and one day I saw him counting a big, fat stack of 500-rupee notes.\
  \ \n       Then there was the annoyingly persistent tiger balm salesman who turned\
  \ out to just be trying to send his daughter to a good private school. And the pretty\
  \ young beggar who appeared so helpless but who was soon sighted on an international\
  \ flight. None of these people were exclusively what I assumed them to be, yet they\
  \ weren't entirely not what I assumed, either. It may be tempting to neatly itemize\
  \ people and file them away, but in doing so we overlook the abundance of nuances\
  \ that actually amount to real people.\n       These experiences helped me to realize\
  \ that people are not just the roles we see them play, nor are they the characters\
  \ we make up in our heads. Seeing things as all one way or all the other way may\
  \ be comforting, but it's not reality. When we stop pursuing an absolute vision\
  \ of reality and start leaning into nuance, we begin to see the world a little more\
  \ truthfully."
