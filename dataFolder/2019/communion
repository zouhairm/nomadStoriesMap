Text: "My senses were drawn to the roaring stream some 15 meters below in a deep,\
  \ narrow canyon.  It had texture and translucency of fresh concrete.  I wanted to\
  \ drink it.  Falling in meant certain death but there could be a more accessible\
  \ shore upstream.  Dima and I quickly found a bridge across made from several freshly\
  \ cut trees, some ropes and clay.  Prints of cow hooves on it \u2013 a local herdsman\
  \ has decided this to be the fittest place to cross, why should we doubt him? We\
  \ did not bother with the rope: thirst ruled supreme.  A water stream marked on\
  \ our map was dry yesterday, making for a rather cruel summiting on our first day\
  \ of the expedition; we missed another spring on the morning of today and were suffering\
  \ the consequences. A cruel civil war in Tajikistan ended 9 years ago but the country\
  \ still felt jittery, so all the travel notes and tourist maps were dated and unreliable\
  \ in the ever-shifting early-Earth landscape of the Pamir.  Even the mighty ridge\
  \ ahead looked completely different than the map predicted, apparently having lost\
  \ an enormous buttress in some recent shakeup.\n\nA few minutes up along the narrow\
  \ trail we realized there was a clear, white brook running from the side of that\
  \ ridge.  By some magic, it burst out in the middle of a bone-dry stone face.  We\
  \ rushed towards it, empty plastic bottles shaking in nylon rope bags.  Three other\
  \ members of our team waited with our backpacks in the first bush shade we could\
  \ find after a gruelling descent in 40\xB0 C on varied, treacherous scree of burning\
  \ hot boulders, cobblestones and gravel.  That descent had ruined my feet, covering\
  \ them in painful blisters: a reward for mistakes in training and selection of boots.\n\
  \nIt was five years since I returned home from extensive and often convoluted travels,\
  \ four since I got painfully divorced, and one month since a breakup with a manipulative\
  \ and alcoholic business partner.  That last thing nearly got violent and left me\
  \ neurotic and fearing the ring of my phone.  I hardly knew what to do with my life\
  \ next and learnt the meaning of anxiety.  I envisioned achieving some enlightenment\
  \ and serenity when we\u2019d climb the Pamir\u2019s magnificent 7000+ meter peaks\
  \ at the climax of our ambitious plan to hike a loop through the central part of\
  \ the range autonomously, carrying all our supplies for 30 days.  \n\nLater that\
  \ day, assessing the damage to my feet, I concluded: I am unfit for the trip and\
  \ will be a burden to all.  I need to get my ass back.  The next day, while I was\
  \ mulling the decision and the way I\u2019d break it to all, two members of our\
  \ team narrowly escaped death in a flash mudslide.  When helping them, a simple\
  \ realization came: I would betray everyone if I left.  My feet may be hurting,\
  \ but there was responsibility and weight no one would assume.  Just like that,\
  \ this decision and the sheer need to survive the next 28 days made everything very\
  \ simple.  I was no longer troubled by mistakes and threats back home, and that\
  \ night I had a very clear dream: I was getting married to a beautiful, happy, loving\
  \ girl.  I could almost discern her face. \n\nThe rest of the trip, which brought\
  \ a whole new understanding of fatigue and effort, never once had I despaired. \
  \ In fact, the physical pain in the feet, and the tiredness from carrying that spine-breaking\
  \ backpack appeared to be relegated to some lower realm of self, while the rest\
  \ of me could enjoy the views.  Even the sheer Himalayan enormity of the Pamir was\
  \ not crushing but elevating.  Yet, the trauma of thirst in the first two days had\
  \ its impact.  Any time we passed a stream or a pool on the surface of a glacier,\
  \ I\u2019d kneel and drink, unable to resist.  And every time it felt special: word\
  \ \u201Ccommunion\u201D entered the mind.  Then, I\u2019d stand and look around,\
  \ admiring the great cathedral, where our tiny group continued its pilgrimage."
