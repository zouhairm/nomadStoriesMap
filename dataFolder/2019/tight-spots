Text: "Tight Spots\n\nt was a beautiful Saturday morning in the Alentejo.  We headed\
  \ out from our small rental on a sunny October morning for the lauded Saturday market\
  \ in Estremoz.  We traveled about fifteen minutes through lovely, rolling countryside\
  \ filled with vineyards and cork oaks.  The greens and oranges and golds of the\
  \ landscape painted a pleasing picture punctuated from time to time by sheep sharing\
  \ the rolling fields with Neolithic rock formations.\n\nWe thought we had departed\
  \ early, but when we arrived in Estremoz, we found a large number of cars there\
  \ already, and  we began our search for a spot for our too-large rental. After driving\
  \ a bit, my friend Susan was directed by a Frenchman to pull into a space that looked\
  \ quite small.  Nonetheless, she followed his directions, and the car did, in fact,\
  \ fit. We went to the market where we could get wonderful fresh cheeses, fruits\
  \ and vegetables, as well as the lovely Portuguese pottery-terra cotta bowls and\
  \ plates painted with bright flowers, fish and geometric designs-and purses and\
  \ other articles made of cork. \n\nAfter doing our shopping for the week, we went\
  \ back to the car. The parking lot was even more crowded than it was when we first\
  \ arrived. Susan began to try to pull out around the car that had parked perpendicularly\
  \ to the front of our car or the ones that had parked behind us. To us, it seemed\
  \ that getting out of the space was something we just couldn't do at that time.\
  \  While we could accept that, the helpful Portuguese could not. In no time at all\
  \ we went from having one, then two people trying to direct us. Before long, what\
  \ appeared to be half the town was standing in front of us motioning and trying\
  \ to provide directions on how to extract the car from the space. Susan tried to\
  \ communicate with them that that it was OK, we could just wait, but that wasn't\
  \ going to be an option. Finally, one of the gentlemen walked over and asked if\
  \ he could get into the car. We consented, and he proceeded to back the car out\
  \ and pull it around with apparent ease. We all laughed and were grateful for their\
  \ insistent Portuguese helpfulness. \n\nAbout a week later,  I was driving a different\
  \ pair of friends to an ocean-side restaurant in the Algarve.  I thought that I\
  \ was driving on the path towards the parking area but soon realized that I was\
  \ actually driving across the sand and began to back up to get back to the road.\
  \ I turned too soon and found the car mired in a sand bank. We began to try get\
  \ the car out without success and soon--you guessed it!--people were pouring out\
  \ of the restaurant to direct us on how we could extricate ourselves. More than\
  \ once, we received the advice to have at least four people sit in the trunk, which\
  \ we tried; it did not work. I finally resorted to calling a tow truck. When that\
  \ was taken care of, we walked into the restaurant for lunch.  One of the waitresses\
  \ asked, \u201CWas that you with the car?\u201D When I told her it was, she said,\
  \ \u201CDid you try putting four people in the trunk?\u201D \n\nWhat happened on\
  \ these two occasions is typical of the friendliness and helpfulness of the Portuguese\
  \ people. Even though the situations we found ourselves in were embarrassing to\
  \ us at the time, we look back at them fondly, thinking of how neighborly and caring\
  \ the people of Portugal are."
