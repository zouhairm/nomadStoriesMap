Text: "She was about forty and she had kind eyes. And the eyes were looking at me\
  \ curiously. \n\u201CBrauchen Sie Hilfe?\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019\
  t speak German.\u201D I must\u2019ve been sounded really nervous during my last\
  \ phone call with my aunt. The woman sitting against me in the Dusseldorf\u2019\
  s train raised her eyebrows.\n\u201CDo you need some help?\u201D\n\u201COh, well\u2026\
  \ Thank you\u2026 You know it\u2019s a funny story...\u201D\nWell it was not a very\
  \ funny story. Actually, it was the opposite of funny, it was the most absolutely-not-funny\
  \ story ever! Few hours before I had been sitting at the Moscow airport expecting\
  \ the boarding when my phone has beeped. \u201CNastya, don\u2019t come\u201D. First,\
  \ I thought it was a joke. There were guys I\u2019d met a couple of months before\
  \ that on the other trip. They were from Germany, we added one another on Facebook\
  \ and then started joking about me visiting them sometime. And I thought \u201C\
  why not? It\u2019s a great adventure for a weekend\u201D How could I be so stupid???\
  \ I bought the tickets, made a visa, booked the hotel room some small town far away\
  \ from Dusseldorf, I couldn\u2019t even reach the hotel without their help. \u201C\
  Nastya, don\u2019t come\u201D. That\u2019s it. No further comments. Are they kidding\
  \ me?? I\u2019m almost on the plane!!\n\u201CIt can\u2019t be true!\u201D The eyebrows\
  \ of the nice lady on the train were so high I thought for a minute they could fly\
  \ away. \u201CYou poor little thing!\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m afraid it can.\u201D\
  \ I laughed. The couple of hours before that I\u2019d spent at the airport deciding\
  \ what to do, calling my family and asking everybody for any help. I had no money\
  \ and my phone was almost broken. My aunt called me and said she booked a hotel\
  \ room in the city. \u201CI decided to stay in Dusseldorf by my own and got the\
  \ hotel. The man at the airport helped me to find this train and even gave me a\
  \ map. The next station,\u201D I showed her the map and smiled, \u201Cis mine!\u201D\
  \n\u201COops..\u201D\n\u201C\u2019Oops\u2019? What is \u2018oops\u2019?\u201D It\
  \ was a turn of my eyebrows to raise.\n\u201CPlease I ask you just don\u2019t worry.\
  \ The next station is closed. It\u2019s only today. Yesterday everything was fine.\u201D\
  \n\u201CSeriously?! I must\u2019ve been cursed!\u201D\n\u201CHoney don\u2019t worry\
  \ the station after that is mine and I\u2019ll help you to find your way back.\u201D\
  \nAfter that there were hecting running after buses under the night October rain,\
  \ asking strangers, seeking for another train platform, goodbye-hugs with this (God\
  \ bless her) woman and finally, FINALLY soft warm bad in my hotel. And then there\
  \ was the best weekend in new, friendly, adorable and really beautiful autumn German\
  \ city. First trip by myself. Last thing I expected to find"
