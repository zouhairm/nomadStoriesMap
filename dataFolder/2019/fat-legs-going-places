Text: "The dew on the leaves is peculiar. The sky is bluer than ever and the heart\
  \ echoes in a place that is alien to me. The strangers that passes by me smile or\
  \ the notorious pigeons making their way to the Danube walking way is all so different.\
  \ It's like a different world.\n\n  My fat legs that have always been hidden in\
  \ the heart of my lies and insecurities, smile as I walk down to the old town of\
  \ Bratislava. There aren't any local tourists to my surprise but just some people\
  \ with a wide smile. My blue dress smells \n the local food filled with cheese.\
  \ My land is miles away from me, but here, I feel at home.\n\n  The winds have a\
  \ different taste, the sky have the color that was impossible to paint in the canvas,\
  \ the kind strangers with blue eyes or the ice cream shop, 'Luculus' that burst\
  \ flavors into mouth; let me dance in the city escapes as I wait for the tram to\
  \ move ahead. \n\n  I've been searching for the better half- that someone to hold\
  \ hands with, to cross the roads and I have asked this question to myself, a million\
  \ times. Alas, I'll have to wait longer. The shallow questioning eyes have given\
  \ in a perfect answer as I climbed the Hrad Castle in the middle of night with two\
  \ strangers. Like it was meant to be. The sweet kiss of local wine at the wall of\
  \ the closed castle gates made me skip a heart beat as I look upon the silent igniting\
  \ city lights from the top of the world. \n\n  What is life? I think about this\
  \ looking at the two strangers sitting next to me. Life is a moment. A timeline?\
  \ Is it the cripsy wine at a foreign land or the smell of smoke?\n   Life is 200,000\
  \ heartbeats everyday till you skip a heartbeat to discover a joyous moment to find\
  \ yourself beautiful and priveleged enough to experience. \n\n   The evenings at\
  \ Danube revisits the memories of hanging glasses on my face so my eyes could see\
  \ the sun drowning in the river, hence turning the colors of sky from pink to purple\
  \ to blue and finally black. The night sky, finally ignite with little twinkling\
  \ city lights and fairy dust. It was like letting my body flow that was yet to be\
  \ discovered in the smell of an alien land.\n\n  My brown skin, my black hair and\
  \ my fat legs felt at peace and reminded me to see the world from their own eyes\
  \ than the mind that kept saying to hide them otherwise. \n\n  It was like meeting\
  \ a new woman who was able to read offline maps, talk to strangers with blue eyes,\
  \ look in the mirror and smile and even dance on the streets. It felt empowering\
  \ to be belonging in a land that wasn't mine. For a moment it was, and yet even\
  \ today, I call Bratislava mine.\n\n  I have encountered a strange person within\
  \ me that I never knew existed. I have addressed and adored the smile that was humble.\
  \ My book that waits for me to touch it on the cold bench in the evening in front\
  \ of Danube waits as it spills the fairy colors of joy. I sat there as I observed\
  \ the changing colors of the sky with my dreamy eyes. \nAh, my Bratislava, you've\
  \ made me fall in love with me and I'm not scared anymore to be anything but me.\n\
  \nI looked at the stranger who smiled as I smiled back and continued reading the\
  \ book. \nI guess, I've found the soul mate which mean the world to me. \nAnd if\
  \ you ask me what is life for me? I will say,' Life's an unexpected dream that I\
  \ didn't expect to find unless I met Bratislava.'"
