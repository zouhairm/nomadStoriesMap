Text: "I had driven through countless towns like Packwood. They existed as fast blurs\
  \ in my mind's eye, falling into my rearview mirror in a matter of minutes. Each\
  \ had their unspectacular grocery outlet, a few neglected motels and a gas station\
  \ at the edge of town; the town limits could be seen within one straight glance.\
  \ \n\nIn 2013 however, I drove into Packwood, WA and stayed. I had taken up an assignment\
  \ with the local AmeriCorps program to help youth and hadn't even given much thought\
  \ to the locale. Coming from a rather liberal and affluent college town, I'd always\
  \ considered myself an open-minded and unprejudiced individual. Taking up residence\
  \ in a rural community quickly challenged me to take stock of that assessment. \n\
  \nIt's true that some of the rural stereotypes were well-founded. For instance,\
  \ during the first interaction with my landlord, he inquired as to the religious\
  \ practices of my parents and had to stifle back disbelief when I explained to him\
  \ that they had an interfaith marriage. In the schools I was met by some students\
  \ and parents with skepticism due to the bohemian, \"flower-child\" fashions that\
  \ I donned. I was also faced with the very real challenges of adults in addiction\
  \ and children living with the abusive behavior that went hand in hand. In those\
  \ regards, I experienced a surreal crash course in realities I'd only seen depicted\
  \ in media. \n\nAnd yet, Packwood forever changed the lens with which I view small\
  \ communities. While there, I discovered a melting pot of spiritual, cultural and\
  \ political beliefs hiding in the minutiae of generalizations. While the church\
  \ held a very central position in the community for instance, I discovered that\
  \ the owner of our grocery store - and stand-in minister at one point - was deeply\
  \ interested in meditation and mindfulness practice. I shared a deep conversation\
  \ with an older woman during one of my visits to the local senior center where we\
  \ spoke about unconventional marriages and dealing with mental illness. I became\
  \ close with a woman who, despite failed relationships and a long history of family\
  \ drama, was one of the most responsible and open-minded mothers to her adopted\
  \ son, a straight-A student. \n\nDespite a rocky beginning, I even one the hearts\
  \ of one of my most rugged and disruptive students. For the first several months,\
  \ he wore an air of apathy towards me and continuously disregarded any attempts\
  \ I made to mentor or discipline. To me, he appeared as a child that had been through\
  \ too much hardship and neglect to ever allow me into his circle. To him, I was\
  \ very much the urban transplant.  And then one day, an incident with another student\
  \ arose and the reaction of other volunteers was only escalating the situation.\
  \ In a moment of vulnerability, I stepped aside with him and spoke authentically\
  \ about what I saw and asked questions that gave him some voice in the situation.\
  \ Gradually from that point on, our rapport developed a sense of respect and trust\
  \ that I never would have imagined I'd be given by this particular student. \n\n\
  These unexpected paradigm shifts happened again and again, as stereotypes were replaced\
  \ by real connections. An older woman that was known throughout town to be abrasive\
  \ and nearly impossible to befriend became one of my closest friends of all. Another\
  \ anomaly of her origin, she had grown up spearheading the movement of civil rights\
  \ for the LGBTQ community. After a motorcycle crash that was supposedly going to\
  \ leave her paralyzed, she retaught herself to walk and talk not by conventional\
  \ methods but by way of her passion for natural medicine and energy work. \n\nBy\
  \ the time my time was up in the program, I had become just as much a part of the\
  \ community as everyone else and would now find myself more readily withholding\
  \ assumptions in my day to day life. I feel like this is the accomplishment of any\
  \ travel experience, and one that should not be taken for granted. To withhold assumption\
  \ is to make room for wonder. And it is in that space that all human growth happens."
