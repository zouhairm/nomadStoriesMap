Text: "Eight countries, three continents, seven months, and Candace had exactly two\
  \ things to show for it: loads of experiences and a below-zero bank account. Like\
  \ so many before her, she arrived broke in Australia, looking to spice up her bank\
  \ account. \nSo, she went to work. She found herself in Perth, working as a kitchen\
  \ hand in a Mexican restaurant and as bar staff in a hotel. She also found a home\
  \ in an awesome hostel, called the Witch\u2019s Hat. The halls were painted white,\
  \ with lots of framed pictures of previous guests. The floors were all wooden planks,\
  \ making it look aged, yet still very warm. The kitchen was clean and not really\
  \ big enough for the 50 guests, but she learned to live with that. The outside area\
  \ had four picnic tables, lots of plants and trees, and a free-to-use barbecue.\
  \ A generally joyful atmosphere. \nPeople came and went, and she got used to it,\
  \ but there were also some long-term stayers, whom became like family to her. There\
  \ was Cedric, a French welder, there was Katherine, a German party-girl. There was\
  \ Lucas, Nico, Quinten, Susanne,... About 12 people formed what you could call the\
  \ inner circle of the hostel. \n\nYep, Candace was pleased to call this place home.\
  \ \n\nBesides this inner circle, there was also one other permanent resident, Joe,\
  \ who stayed a week and then went working in the mines for two weeks. Apparently,\
  \ he was there longer than the current manager. A little weird that he didn't have\
  \ a home of his own. He fixed everything in the hostel, from electricity to plumbing.\
  \ Being there for three months, Candace saw him as your typical, 50-year-old Australian:\
  \ big around the waist and always drunk after 5pm. He seemed kind of friendly, but\
  \ conversations with Joe usually didn\u2019t go anywhere. \nThat image changed one\
  \ night, after they came back from their favorite bar with a group. Candace and\
  \ Nico agreed on a last smoke in the courtyard before going to bed, which usually\
  \ ended in a little make-out session.  \n\nThey started rolling their cigarettes\
  \ and getting closer to each other, until they heard a quiet, sobbing noise. They\
  \ looked around and saw Joe, with his shoulders shaking. It was strange to see,\
  \ because men of that posture don\u2019t cry, do they? They went to his picnic table.\
  \ \n\u201CHey Joe, everything alright?\u201D said Candace. \nJoe looked up and tried\
  \ to dry his tears. \n\u201COh, sorry, I didn\u2019t think somebody would come outside.\u201D\
  \n\u201CThat\u2019s alright, man\u201D Nico comforted him. \u201CYou look like you\
  \ could use somebody to talk to.\u201D \nJoe looked at Nico and Candace, as if he\
  \ was trying to decide if he could trust them. All of a sudden, the proverbial dam\
  \ broke and Joe shared his story, his voice higher than usual :\n\u201CNine years\
  \ ago, I came home from the mines and the wife had all her shit packed.\u201D he\
  \ paused. \n\u201CAnd maybe she was right. I don\u2019t blame her for that. But\
  \ she took our son and daughter with her.\u201D His voice trembled. \n\u201CI see\
  \ them once every three weeks, and only if I pay the $2000 alimony per month. I\u2019\
  m missing out so many things in their lives. And now, I actually am home on Kelly\u2019\
  s birthday, she\u2019s taking both of them to Bali.\u201D He stopped, took a sip\
  \ from his drink, apologized again and went to his room. \nCandace and Nico sat\
  \ their, completely frozen. Now they realized why Joe was staying here: because\
  \ he missed his children. Staying in this hostel with young travelers must remind\
  \ him of them. \nNo make-out session today, they both went to their own bed. The\
  \ next day, they told some people of the family and they all had the same surprised\
  \ and slightly ashamed reaction. \nNow they made sure, when Joe was around, they\
  \ asked him to join their activities. And he slowly became not their surrogate dad,\
  \ but something like an awesome, cool uncle. It was noticeable that Joe smiled more.\
  \ Candace assumed he settled for that roll. As a wise poet once said: \n\nYou can\u2019\
  t always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get\
  \ what you need."
