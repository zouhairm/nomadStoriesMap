Text: "I started my domestic trip in 2015. It began with my interest in cheap backpacker\
  \ trips. Then i thought why i didn't try it ?. And I want to teach my special daughter\
  \ to know the world with cheap backpacker travel. She must know that traveled was\
  \ not necessarily expensive. I began the trip from Bandung, West Java. while I stayed\
  \ in Semarang, Central java. Our 2D1N trip I can say as a journey that only rely\
  \ on an internet connection. I collected all the itineraries from the bloggers.\
  \ \nFirst of all I have to choose a destination that is suitable for my daughter.\
  \ Among other things, I choose a destination such as outbound or dexterity and nature.\
  \ I chose 2 to 3 destinations that are quite close together, by making sure through\
  \ Google map. Then I chose lodging that was around there too. Of course i used Google\
  \ Map. I do not forget that I also searched various promos for accommodation, transportation,\
  \ and places we will visit.\nOur Bandung trip i can called it like lost in space.\
  \ The place that i've never to go to before. But it's verry funtastic. We went to\
  \ Lembang, and came to The Runch and Floating Market. The Runch just looked like\
  \ a farm. There are many horses. And of course much activities like flying fox,\
  \ riding horse, cycling, and more.\nFloating market is culinary market on the lake.\
  \ The special is we had to boat first, and we must change our money to special coin.\
  \ We can't used money that ussually we used. Many cullinary such as traditional\
  \ or international there. Not just cullinary market, Floating Market Lembang Bandung\
  \ has big miniatur train, rabbit garden, souvenir shop and much more.\nIndonesia\
  \ has much beautiful destination. Bandung trip was success. Then my next Indonesian\
  \ are, Karimunjawa Island in Jepara - Central Java, Rote Island in East Nusa Tenggara,\
  \ Lombok Island in West Nusa Tenggara. There are sexiest Island that make me speechless.\
  \ The more exotic places were i came are Batu City in East Java, and Gunungkidul\
  \ in Yogyakarta.\nMany Indonesian destination i would come to. There's no much words\
  \ i shared, but too much photos i did share on my Social Media. Sometimes i just\
  \ speechless or so fascinated to write in a story. Many destination i waould to\
  \ come, domestic or Internasional. God always beautiful painting. I want to see\
  \ all of that, and share to other."
