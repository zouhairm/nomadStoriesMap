Text: "I would never describe myself as an outgoing person. I am quiet, my palms would\
  \ easily become sweaty and once I was told to be \"the uneasiest person ever\" when\
  \ I had to be in front of a camera. This is why I accepted with a kind and silent\
  \ giggle a friend of mine's advice to start meeting CouchSurfing travellers in my\
  \ hometown. \nCouchSurfing is a social network of over 14 million active users who\
  \ travel around the globe and you may offer them a bed (or apparantly a couch) when\
  \ they visit your city - if you are brave enough to host a stranger. But if you\
  \ are not, you can still go out there in the blue for a short hangout, because,\
  \ supposedly, they have already found a place to stay and would like to share time\
  \ with you. \nI have attempted to be a tourist in my hometown before. Have you?\
  \ Of course, I am not talking about the disadvantages like huge backpacks and trying\
  \ to find a decent English speaker to guide you to a place with tasty food. But\
  \ have you tried walking at the main street and gazing into the details of the buildings?\
  \ Plovdiv has the longest city walkway in Europe and this, combined with the fact\
  \ that most of the buildings were erected in the 1920s, makes it excellent for a\
  \ slow motion stroll.\n\"Let me catch this moment\", said Johannes, a young German\
  \ I met here in summer when I took him to a building with fresques of young girls\
  \ dancing into an unspectacular street just next to the main one. He did it with\
  \ an imaginary camera, because isn't thus how one catches moments - with their own\
  \ mind? Johannes had a bit of travelling around Bulgaria for the last week or so\
  \ and he already felt as an adopted citizen. He told me about his passion for a\
  \ breakfast with \"banichka and boza\" (a local cheese pastry and its closest fellow\
  \ - a dense beverage made of rye or wheat that may contain up to 1% alcohol), he\
  \ had a jar of \"lyutenitsa\" (a softer version of the Balkan aivar but with more\
  \ pepper) in his backpack and he already had some impressive reading skills in Cyrilic\
  \ alphabet. I took him to one of the hills - Nebet tepe - that we could just enjoy\
  \ the aerial view and talk about life. He needed just a one beer to start - to my\
  \ own astonishment more than anybody else's - chanting a local's club anthem - and\
  \ how cool is that?\nChangheon was 31 when I met him. He had been travelling around\
  \ the globe - from his home country South Korea to Australia, South America and\
  \ now Europe - so I needed to try harder if I truly wanted to make him in awe of\
  \ Plovdiv. I took him to another hill - a taller one and with a 11 meters in height\
  \ communist remain monument built just on top. \"I have never experienced racism\
  \ here\", he said to my confusion as he had travelled to quite a lot more tolerant\
  \ countries according to the world charts. Nevertheless, Plovdiv's population has\
  \ always been mixed, with Turkish, Armenian, Jewish and gypsy minorities and locals\
  \ got used to the mixed environment long time ago.\n\"Here you are, hello!\" was\
  \ how Rodolfo, a cheerful Venezuelan who resided in Moscow, greeted me with a huge\
  \ grin from ear to ear. He had other travelling plans, but his companion left him\
  \ on his own and he had to choose a cheap last-minute destination - and that is\
  \ how faith sent him to me on a Saturday afternoon. \"I like the cosy and friendly\
  \ atmosphere\", he said to me after we tried mynth - another local drink that is\
  \ typical in summer. Nowadays Moscow is a city of tall business buildings so I guess\
  \ a break from the hustle and bustle was highly valued.\n\nIt all started with my\
  \ wish to escape from my own reality, but I guess it made me value it more and more.\
  \ \"Palinka, shlivovitsa, rakiya - it's all the same\", told me Johannes with a\
  \ deep and serious voice when talking about the Balkan drinks. And if they are,\
  \ aren't we all?"
