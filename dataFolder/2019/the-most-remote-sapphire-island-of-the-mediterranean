Text: "I boarded the flight frantically after having chugged my full beer and my cousin's\
  \ beer I'd ordered too eagerly after we heard the delay announcement. I hadn't even\
  \ been sure I was actually going to Italy that day, but now he was being rushed\
  \ off to first-class and I was apparently late. I had a backpack, a phone, and a\
  \ last-minute exclusive invite to a wedding on the island of Capri, Italy. \n\n\
  Okay, so technically I didn't have an \u201Cofficial\u201D invite. But my cousin\
  \ did, and I knew the couple well enough to comfortably crash. To be fair, it wasn\u2019\
  t even a real wedding. The couple, the type who you call Aunt and Uncle even when\
  \ they\u2019re not related to you, were renewing their vows after 30 years of marriage.\
  \ They\u2019re also the type of couple to invite you to Italy and give you no other\
  \ details whatsoever, so all I knew was that I was the well-traveled-enough cousin\
  \ irresponsibly deemed responsible enough to help my cousin traverse Italy, given\
  \ both his recent surgery and his knack for being a too-loud rambunctious American\
  \ even while still in America. I had a free buddy pass flight from my real Aunt,\
  \ a veteran flight attendant, which is all we thought we needed before we landed\
  \ in Rome with zero plans of where to stay or go next, besides South. \n\nThere\
  \ are a few things you should know about Capri before getting strapped into the\
  \ flight, the trains, the ferry, the tourist scams, the accidental hikes, and the\
  \ hot pink convertible taxi it took us to arrive. First of all, it\u2019s worth\
  \ it. As the former summer home of Roman emperors, I can barely imagine how they\
  \ made the trek, let alone why they would ever return. To be fair, one of the (several)\
  \ Roman rulers named Tiberius never did, and his recluse on Capri has been left\
  \ nearly unexplored since his alleged debaucheries. The \u20AC800 I spent just to\
  \ get on the actual island looks like nothing compared to the 800 A.D. gilded church\
  \ that sits covertly like a Queen\u2019s winning chess piece in the cobblestone\
  \ piazza, next to a Mediterranean view that looks like it inspired the word sapphire\
  \ all on its own, after inventing turquoise.\n\nAn Italian piazza is nothing like\
  \ the \u201Ctown square\u201D you\u2019re imagining, even if that is the typical\
  \ translation. It\u2019s a gathering place, sure, the way the bright pink, purple,\
  \ and blue top-down convertibles that speed through the narrow streets for $20 are\
  \ mere taxis. Capri\u2019s most famous Piazza Umberto is the answer to why one would\
  \ ever desire to build on a perpendicular cliff. Walk in the square during the day,\
  \ and you\u2019re likely to see models strolling through from the shops of Gucci\
  \ that sparkle just past the gelato shop, almost as pretty as the thin margarita\
  \ pizzas ubiquitously served. Walk in the square when it hits dark, and the smoky\
  \ Campari and the company is likely not to let you leave at least until the real\
  \ night starts, far closer to midnight. While phones are unlikely to work regardless,\
  \ it\u2019s unnecessary to even try. Anyone you know or might want to know will\
  \ be at the Piazzetta turn dusk any night of the week, with no forefront plan, no\
  \ questions asked, and no expectations. \n\nWe didn\u2019t know it yet, but we\u2019\
  d begun with the Capri mindset. Upon our unlikely arrival two days later in the\
  \ fashionable Piazzetta enduring sweaty cotton t-shirts and gym shoes that belong\
  \ in a parody, we looked nothing like the beauty that awaited us. It didn\u2019\
  t matter. The true luxury of Capri isn\u2019t in the glamorous villas or the allure\
  \ of the mid-Mediterranean, but the atmosphere that no matter where you are on the\
  \ island, you feel as if you\u2019ve arrived at the right place. The yachts in the\
  \ Tyrrhenian Sea give a sense of another layer of opulence to be experienced here,\
  \ but wisps of discontent dissipate with the island's promise of a rowboat to take\
  \ you to its true jewel, the fluorescent underwater cave called the Blue Grotto.\
  \ I learned later this was the site of the couple's unlikely love story- and without\
  \ a plan, I went."
