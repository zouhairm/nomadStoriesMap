Text: "Pierluigi Zampaglione calls his organic Fiano wine Don Chisciotte for a reason.\
  \ People thought he was crazy. \n\nPlant grapes?\n\nCultivate the low yielding delicate\
  \ and noble Apianum on a windswept slope deep in the heart of Eastern Irpinia? \n\
  \n While not exactly insanity, they said it was a stretch to imagine. The Eastern\
  \ Irpinian region has been many things to various peoples throughout history but\
  \ it has never been thought of as a good place for producing fine wine. \n\nPierluigi\
  \ of course wanted to write his own story - \n\nUnder the force of an enchantment\
  \ (or was it il tocco femminile?) Pierluigi Zampaglione took to planting fiano on\
  \ his family\u2019s contrada Tufiello, about 8 kilometers from the nearest town,\
  \ about 8 years ago. \n\nA vast unprotected area boasting a brigand past, the territory\
  \ of Alta Irpinia is situated on the far eastern confines of the region of Campania\
  \ - and the zone called Irpinia Orientale reaches even further east to Apulia.\n\
  If you look at a good topographical map you\u2019ll see Irpinia Orientale towns\
  \ - Lacedonia, Aquilonia & Monteverde - are few and far between, her contrade occupy\
  \ wide swaths of endless space.\n\nNot too long ago, it would have taken a rider\
  \ the better part of a day to reach one or another of these towns on the back of\
  \ a rickety donkey - if he had to get there. Seasonal transumanza herds have crossed\
  \ its terrain from the north for millennia, bringing cowboys and shepherds and hunters\
  \ and their teams. Some call it the Wild West. Dry and temperate most summers, her\
  \ rolling fields made golden by drying wheat, are much warmer in autumn. Come winter,\
  \ desolation sets in and the area becomes nearly uninhabitable by all but the stoutest\
  \ men.\n\nNerina embraces her husband\u2019s penchant with the grace of a Napolitana.\
  \ \u2018Siamo un po fuori area\u2019  she says. \n\nThat is, they are succeeding.\
  \ \n\nPierliugi produces a good wine from an ancient grape planted in a place that\
  \ was never expected to yield such results. \n\nIl tocco femminile, Nerina tells\
  \ me, applies also to the delicacy of their Fiano - a decision to produce a light-bodied\
  \ fragrant wine without overpowering or overcomplicating the palate; fermented without\
  \ the use of chemicals with only organic yeast. A natural wine.\n\n\nAnd thanks\
  \ to this, Don Chisciotte has been a selection at NOMA, in Copenhagen (featured\
  \ on Anthony Bourdains\u2019 Parts Unknown) and is on the list at Brawn in London.\n\
  \nAnd it can be ordered at Viniveri annual natural wine festival in Cerea near Verona\
  \ or purchased in NYC at Chambers Street Wines and in Boston at Vineyard Road. \n\
  \nThe irony now is that the area to the south and east of contrada Tufiello has\
  \ recently been dotted with giant windmills. Those wind turbines - or pale eoliche\
  \ - known in California and other wine and windy places, have been planted in an\
  \ attempt to shore up Southern Italy's regional economy. Don Quixote indeed."
