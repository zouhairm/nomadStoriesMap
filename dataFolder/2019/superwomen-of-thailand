Text: "It was unplanned, yet I needed to unwind somewhere. Chose Thailand - land of\
  \ the free, as it\u2019s any common man\u2019s paradise. Name anything and you have\
  \ it there. You ask a cabbie, a vendor or any on your sight; you get it still.\n\
  Pierce Brosnan riding tuktuk in a James Bond movie and stories about sex tourism\
  \ were the only things I knew about Thailand before. You never know until you go.\
  \ The picture I had in my mind earlier has completely transformed into a traveler\u2019\
  s must visit destination. Perfect blend of everything in the world; nature, wildlife,\
  \ spirituality, nightlife, parties, cuisines, massages, sex and even drugs. I still\
  \ wonder how a country can balance so perfectly the good and bad aspects from the\
  \ world.   \nHeard of women empowerment? Of course on stages and Television. Alas,\
  \ what you saw is feminism. The real women empowerment  is when a women brings her\
  \ kid\u2019s bread and butter. Unlike any other country, the business at Thailand\
  \ are women oriented, not as employees but as employers. They have their imprints\
  \ everywhere, be it at hotels, pubs, or even as street vendors. Remember they aren\u2019\
  t numb or naive, but strong enough to kick any man\u2019s ass. I recall when a lady\
  \ smacked a man rough and tough on broad daylight  with a pan for misbehaviour.\
  \ Poor lad, that was his time to learn his lessons.\nIt\u2019s from Thailand I learned\
  \ that we created the separation in white and blue collars. After all we all earn\
  \ for our half feet stomach minutes lasting lust. Had there been no hunger, there\
  \ would have been a better world. It\u2019s not the job or status, it\u2019s only\
  \ your mindset. Even a sex worker is the saviour of her own family. Millions of\
  \ earning women outnumbering the men are the real gem of Thailand today. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find any place where women can lead better than men. Anyways it\u2019\
  s better to find and share now than never!!!"
