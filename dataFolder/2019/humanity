  \ and accustom with each other and volves\u060CWhat is the difference between these\
  \ two types of society?solution, is people who live in a society with strong opportunities\
  \ and who live in a deprived society? Does it have an impact on the progress and\
  \ decisions of a nation?I live in a country where there are no motives left, but\
  \ the only thing that is left to me is hope, I live in a country where most people\
  \ are mentally ill, their thoughts are limited, and the negative ones still leave\
  \ every single issue The negative view is more often than not from the positive\
  \ point of view,And there are so many other problems, the country that I live in,\
  \ but the countries that have a good peace and tranquility, the difference between\
  \ people who live in a peaceful society with facilities, are they negative with\
  \ the people of my country? Did they lose their way of life? Are they also mentally\
  \ ill? And many other issues ..."
