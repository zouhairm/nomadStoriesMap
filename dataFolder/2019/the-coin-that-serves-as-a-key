Text: "I absolutely love the way that life, given we pay close attention, subtly guides\
  \ us from destination to destination, like stepping stones through a river. \n\n\
  At approximately 7:30 am, I calmly woke up in my towering, solitary apartment in\
  \ the heart of Madrid. I sat up, arranged myself, and after a time, my hand impulsively\
  \ shot out to grab some fruit I'd purchased the night before. No regrets there,\
  \ it felt great to finally eat something fresh and healthy to balance out my diet\
  \ a little.  \nThere is such a mouthwatering variety of sweets in Spain that doesn't\
  \ only include the famous churros and porras. I imagine that here, even the most\
  \ esteemed monk would experience a tremendous internal battle as not to break their\
  \ pledge.\n\nPersonally, I was fortunate enough to meet some natives who introduced\
  \ us to a quaint, petite bakery named 'Manolo Blakes,' in a more relaxed area of\
  \ Madrid. There, they offered these mesmerizing tri-chocolate croissants. And to\
  \ be honest, that store didn't really belong in this otherwise quiet neighborhood.\n\
  As you entered the store, pretty quickly there was an agitation that gripped you.\
  \ It fascinated me to see that I couldn't step in any direction as at least 5 Deliveroo\
  \ motorists were coming in for orders at a time,  and not to mention the queue that\
  \ painted and squeezed the street.\nAll to get your hands on one of these jewels.\n\
  Was it worth it? Unquestionably.\n\nAnd do you know what? \nAfter snacking on my\
  \ banana and pear back in the apartment, my first thought was,  'I don't want to\
  \ partake in my regular meditation session.' \n- In retrospect, thankfully I sat\
  \ down to find my center for a time. \nThat tiny, yet tectonic shift for the day\
  \ birthed the means for deciding exactly which destination I would travel to next.\n\
  How exactly?\n\nWell, after dressing, I gladly flowed downstairs. \nI was calmy\
  \ seized and aware of the subtle atmosphere that is often revealed when one observes\
  \ the body and mind for a time, and thus I had no issues to pilot at my own speed.\n\
  I have an intellectual attraction to the duality of transitioning from the quite\
  \ of my room to the stimulation of the bustling streets. \nMy hand wraps around\
  \ the doorknob to meet a sensation of slight cold from the lingering night, a feeling\
  \ of anticipation is already building.\nI love the swift movement of gently flinging\
  \ the gate open, the metal doesn't speak a word. \n\nA slow wind catches my face,\
  \ a cheerful greeting from the city that was hibernating in a modest winter fashion.\n\
  Then, the divine passage between two worlds; a direct portal to the many flavors\
  \ of the central Madrid streets. The very same streets that were already littered\
  \ with the many complex emotions of a Sunday morning.\nThe bodies that move in all\
  \ directions, the souls with their own stories and the minds that begun working\
  \ much earlier, crafting their destinies for the day. \nThe inviting sun that had\
  \ been kind enough to show his face every day that week.\nThe peaceful breeze, an\
  \ equally embraced companion to accompany the heat. \n\nWithin the first minute\
  \ of walking to a rendezvous, at the exact moment I began passing over the vibrating\
  \ road that leads directly to Sol, the heart of Madrid and Spain, I saw something\
  \ twinkling on the floor, gazing curiously at me. \n'What's that?!' I asked myself.\
  \ \nI couldn't be sure If I'd honestly seen what I'd seen. \nThere were hundreds\
  \ of hurried legs, eager to pass over this particular crossing before the green\
  \ converted in red.\nI rushed like an excited kid to pick it up, thinking myself\
  \ very fortunate. 'Great!' I said, pocketing the glistening metal, thinking that\
  \ I'd just won a euro or two. \nSparkling inside, I got out my camera to share the\
  \ delight, when shock clutched me by the collar.\nStaring back at me, in the middle\
  \ of Sol, Madrid, was the Sun of the Argentinean Peso. \nI could have sworn it winked.\n\
  \nWhat surreality I felt during that wave of time.\nAt that moment, I knew instantly\
  \ where I must travel next.\nNot a doubt lingered in my mind."
