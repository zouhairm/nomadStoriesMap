Text: "I was an anxious kid. Fearful and fretful, I never took risks. Never did anything\
  \ more dangerous than wade into the icy waters of the Long Island Sound\u2014only\
  \ to my knees, mind you. A few childhood tumbles in the waves kept my feet firmly\
  \ on sand. \n\nSo imagine my parents\u2019 surprise\u2014my surprise\u2014when I\
  \ decided to go to Ukraine at fifteen years old with a group of kids who loved adventure.\
  \ The lone scaredy-cat, I packed my suitcase full of Pop-Tarts and prayed the plane\
  \ wouldn\u2019t crash. \n\nWe were a group of a dozen or so teenagers and a couple\
  \ of adults. Tasked with helping out at a summer kids\u2019 program, I had no idea\
  \ those two weeks would change my life. Change me. I\u2019d like to say we touched\
  \ people, but the program was canceled due to mudslides (giving me a new natural\
  \ disaster to worry about), and we ended up hanging out with Ukrainian teenagers.\
  \ Our conversations were awkward, peppered with famous American movie quotes and\
  \ stilted words pulled from phrase books. \n\nMy vegetarian diet proved beneficial\
  \ when my teammates were fed liver and I was presented with a pepper stuffed with\
  \ shredded carrots. We ate boiled eggs and brown bread and soup made from beets.\
  \ I forgot about the Pop-Tarts and feasted on pierogi and jam-stuffed pancakes.\
  \ My love of global cooking was sparked. \n\nIn the late 90s, Lozova, Ukraine was\
  \ a city of Soviet-era buildings, blocky and dull, broken up by wide, empty streets.\
  \ A Google search shows not much has changed. It\u2019s not the kind of place digital\
  \ nomads settle in, taking advantage of inexpensive beach bungalows and exciting\
  \ nightlife. It\u2019s where people live their entire lives. They get married, raise\
  \ children, and eventually make khrustyky for grandkids. \n\nFor a teenager raised\
  \ in the sprawling suburbs of New York, though, it was exotic. Babushkas with handkerchief-covered\
  \ heads and red cheeks, ancient cars sputtering, soldiers carrying rifles, medieval\
  \ fountains, snowy white churches topped with golden domes\u2026it all conspired\
  \ to conquer my fear. \nWhen our translator, Sveta, was asked to pick up some papers\
  \ for a meeting, I was recruited. Together we stepped away from our group leaders,\
  \ away from the tumble-down building where a group of American and Ukrainian teenagers\
  \ played icebreakers, and started down the sidewalk. \n\n\u201CWhere are we going?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \n\u201CAcross town.\u201D\n\u201CHow?\u201D\n\nSveta grabbed my elbow,\
  \ pulled me into the street, and waved her hand in the air. An ancient shell of\
  \ a car missing its back window and, given the sounds it made, some very important\
  \ internal parts, pulled up.\n\nAfter a volley of angry-sounding Russian, I found\
  \ myself hitchhiking. \n\nI\u2019d grown up in the age of stranger danger. Hitchhikers\
  \ weren\u2019t timid girls from nice neighborhoods who volunteered at nursing homes.\
  \ And the people who picked up hitchhikers were up to no good. I nearly threw up,\
  \ convinced our faces were about to be plastered all over Ukrainian television.\
  \ \nI picked at Sveta\u2019s sleeve, about to voice my fears, hoping our driver\
  \ didn\u2019t know English, when I heard something. A low buzz that grew in volume.\
  \ \n\nAnd the hive shoved behind the driver\u2019s seat erupted, filling the car\
  \ with bees. \n\nThat moment, I was faced with a decision\u2014continue worrying\
  \ and fretting, now wondering if the police would even be able to identify my swollen,\
  \ bee-stung face, or accept I wasn\u2019t on Long Island anymore and enjoy the ride.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t want to look back at this trip and only remember the fear. I\
  \ wanted to remember what it felt like to step foot in a foreign country for the\
  \ first time, sniff out the pungency of borscht, fall for a Ukrainian boy with dazzling\
  \ blue eyes, and embrace everything it meant to be a world traveler. \nSo I batted\
  \ at bees for ten minutes and enjoyed a crazy ride down an empty street in a falling-apart\
  \ car. \n\nFear didn\u2019t quiet release its hold on me that summer in Ukraine.\
  \ But it did loosen its grip. And with every across-the-world trip, it grows a bit\
  \ weaker. When I left my home for the first time, I didn\u2019t expect to find freedom.\
  \ But that\u2019s exactly what found me."
