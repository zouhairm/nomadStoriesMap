Text: "My journey conceived when I first heard of a place called  Nemrut Da\u011F\u0131\
  \ in southeastern Turkey. This mountain was home to Commagene people who lived there\
  \ after the decline of the Achaemenid Empire. The kings of the Kingdom of Commagene\
  \ claimed descent from  Darius I of Persia as their ancestor. One of their kings,\
  \ Antiochus I Theos of Commagene built a tomb-sanctuary on the top of this mountain\
  \ with several colossal statues whose descriptions can be fully found on the Internet.\
  \ \nI decided to visit this archeological site as well as mountaineering. So, I\
  \ started my journey in the city of Diyarbak\u0131r and dropped off the bus in a\
  \ small village called Narince which sits between Diyarbak\u0131r and Kahta. It\
  \ was late afternoon.\nAs I was walking through the village\u2019s alleys, I stopped\
  \ upon hearing someone who was calling me in broken English. The man, named Mehmet,\
  \ asked me where I was going. Surprised to learn destination, he contended that\
  \ it is a bad time to climb the mountain as it was the mid winter and all roads\
  \ were blocked by heavy snowing. I explained to him that I am a mountaineer and\
  \ use to the harsh climate, and I am determined. He simply couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ it. Then, he asked where I was going at the moment when I replied I was looking\
  \ for a place to camp. He kindly invited me to his house; I thanked and accepted\
  \ his invitation. \nWe went to his home, and according to our plan, woke up at 5\
  \ am to take road department truck for a ride. But, the truck was already full of\
  \ workers, and there was no room for me. I decided to walk around the village and\
  \ take some photos. And, finally, as there was no car to give me a ride, I hit the\
  \ road; I couldn\u2019t stay more despite Mehmet insistence. He offered his motorcycle\
  \ which I couldn\u2019t drive. \nEventually, I arrived at Karadut. While walking,\
  \ someone called me to offer a place to stay to whom I replied that I did not intend\
  \ to stay. I explained to him my purpose of this journey, and he contended almost\
  \ the way Mehmet did, and I replied the way I did before. Then, he invited me to\
  \ drink tea with him. \nI continued my trip. After 8-7 km, I arrived at some abandoned\
  \ buildings. The weather was going to turn; the daylight was about to disappear.\
  \ I decided to camp in one of those buildings. \nNext morning, I saw road personnel\
  \ again. They asked me if I stayed there, and applauded me for my consistence and\
  \ commitment. The snow started, and the wind was so strong that I had to list forward\
  \ to keep myself from rolling back. And then, the storm blew. Ahead of me, some\
  \ 2 km up to the slope before my eyes, there was a building: the last bus station.\n\
  I set up my tenet waiting for the storm to calm which went on through the next morning.\
  \ At six in the morning, I found a window in the weather, promising I could have\
  \ an easier hike. Leaving my bag pack behind, I kept on to the mountaintop carrying\
  \ my camera. It was a dangerous situation as the extremely cold night before turned\
  \ the snow on the ground into a glassy slippery ice bed. I had to be careful because\
  \ the first mistake could be my last as there was a 300-meter deep gorge behind\
  \ me. \nAt last, I was there, the statues at my feet, but the passage led to them\
  \ was so slippery that made it impossible to see them closely. I took some photos\
  \ and headed down. On my way back, I saw road guys again. When I told them my story,\
  \ they just didn\u2019t believe it before I showed them the photos I took. \nI hitchhiked\
  \ back to the city of Gaziantep where I visited its museum, full of statues cut\
  \ from their site at Nemrut Da\u011F\u0131; one of which was showing Antiochus shaking\
  \ hand with the Indo-Persian deity Mithra. That was a moment intriguing me to come\
  \ back when weather is more welcoming to an antique-hungry wanderer like me."
