Text: "There\u2019s something magnetic sometimes that draws you to a place. It\u2019\
  s almost as if you were meant to be in that particular place at that particular\
  \ time.\n\nLast June I set out on a much anticipated 100 day solo voyage around\
  \ South-East Asia. Being plan averse I was guided solely by the list of countries\
  \ I wished to explore, and the alotted time I was afforded in total for my trip.\
  \ \n\nBy day 45 I found myself in Vietnam. I entered through the capital, Hanoi,\
  \ located in the North known for its bustling Old Quarter popular for commerce,\
  \ good eats, precarious yet adrenaline boosting street crossings, and rich culture.\
  \ The streets are quite narrow and sidewalks often filled with makeshift restaurants\
  \ and vendors offering a plethora of discounted products. It\u2019s the perfect\
  \ realization of organized chaos and a real treat to the senses. \n\nAfter about\
  \ a week of exploring Hanoi, upon the strong recommendations of both locals and\
  \ other backpackers, it was suggested that I visit Da Nang in Central Vietnam. As\
  \ the fourth largest city of this South-East Asian nation, Da Nang is well-known\
  \ for being a relaxation hub noted for its high-end resorts and bevy of distinctive\
  \ restaurants. One of its\u2019 main attractions, My Khe Beach, stretches an impressive\
  \ twenty miles. The beach is fairly wide and as such there is no shortage of places\
  \ to lay and enjoy the surf.\n\nI visited Da Nang twice within a week and on either\
  \ occasion saw an alternate view of the city. The coastal side is quiet and shuts\
  \ down fairly early at night while the metropolitan side can be quite lively bursting\
  \ with chic cafes and bars along the main arteries. This is particularly true on\
  \ the weekends. \n\nOn a Monday morning after having experienced what the coast\
  \ and city had to offer, I was longing for a visit to the mountains. After indulging\
  \ in a delightful breakfast of Banh-Mi and egg coffee, I hopped on a local bus to\
  \ make my way to the Marble Mountains. \n\nThe mountains, located about thirty minutes\
  \ from the downtown core, are a cluster of five limestone and marble hills situated\
  \ mid-way between Hoi An and Da Nang. Known as the five element mountains they are\
  \ named after water, wood, fire, metal and earth. The site includes various tunnels,\
  \ caves, peaks and look out points to discover.\n\nArriving at the base of the mountains\
  \ I was met with the option of either entering Hell Cave or ascending Son Mountain.\
  \ I chose to do both in that order for the total cost of about 6USD. \n\nAs you\
  \ enter Hell Cave, to the left, you will happen upon a curious staircase leading\
  \ to the top of what appears to be a light shining down. Naturally my inquisitive\
  \ nature got the best of me and I proceeded to climb up. I was not disappointed.\
  \ The view at the top is quite something to behold as you are blessed with a 360\
  \ degree view overlooking Da Nang. \n\nThinking this would be the highlight of the\
  \ day I was content and had scant expectations of Son Mountain. Little did I know\
  \ then, this day would become one of the most memorable in my travel history thus\
  \ far. As I ascended Son Mountain I could hear melodic chanting pervading the air.\
  \ There was something incredibly calming about being there. I sat on a bench close\
  \ to the temple from which the monks were chanting. To add to the ambiance, just\
  \ across, lay a very impressive 70ft. Lady Buddha marble statue. \n\nAn older gentleman\
  \ with kind eyes sat next to me. We smiled gently at each other but did not speak.\
  \ We shared this odd yet beautiful moment of connection and profound peace from\
  \ being in this place which I can only now describe as magical. To say I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find this would be an understatement.\n\nI stayed far longer than expected\
  \ because I felt it was where I needed to be at the time. It was a reminder to me\
  \ of the beauty of spontaneity in travel and the incredible connections we can share\
  \ with others we may not know."
