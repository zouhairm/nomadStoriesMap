Text: "My trip to Hampi will never appeal to the world if I fail to add the account\
  \ of that drizzling drunk last night of college which could have engulfed me and\
  \ my roommate in a fistfight had it not been for the deal we concluded: I was to\
  \ try Srinivas\u2019s Masala Dosa in Hampi and he the Paradise Hyderabadi Biryani\
  \ before we sought entry in each other\u2019s marriage mandapam. My roommate\u2019\
  s marriage was in a week in Mumbai, and I gathered that it would also be the reunion\
  \ of our \u2018Ullasi Junta\u2019 college gang. I was determined to earn my respectful\
  \ entry to the marriage, and it was only in the persuasion of the last stretch of\
  \ my journey, in a state-operated bus from Hospet to Hampi, that I dared open the\
  \ letter I had received a week ago from my roommate, half expecting its mocking\
  \ content. The conditional invitation to marriage, the trail of pre-marriage tales,\
  \ and the italicized and bolded address of Srinivas Restaurant must have lured my\
  \ fellow co-passenger\u2019s intrusion for he solemnly broke, \u201CIt\u2019s closed.\u201D\
  \n\nThe laconic punch of information proved insufficient to deter me, and an hour\
  \ later I was praying before the older than ancient deity of Virupaksha Temple of\
  \ Hampi seeking divine blessings for my roommate\u2019s marriage.  \n\nI knew Hampi\
  \ like my own closet\u2014organized over four years of college by my roommate. In\
  \ all possible orders, I had heard about the crocodile-infested Tungabhadra, monopoly\
  \ of coracle boats to cross it, erratic bike renters, ruins of Vijayanagara Empire,\
  \ and Srinivas\u2019s gustatory marvel. \n\nTo reach my destiny, I had to cross\
  \ the gentle Tungabhadra in a tarred coracle and rent a fuel-starved scooter on\
  \ the other side. I reached Srinivas Restaurant, for there could have been no doubt\
  \ about it even without corroborating signboards. The grey thatched hut lay as a\
  \ mugshot plate for the majestic auburn granite hill. Flanked by the Government\
  \ Primary school on its right, and centred in a green field, it looked a shade sadder\
  \ than in my memory. It was locked in a rusty chain and seemed abandoned.\n\nSad\
  \ and famished, I drove to a nearby roadside sugarcane juice shop. On enquiry, I\
  \ was informed that there would be no petrol that day because of a statewide strike,\
  \ as for food a moving stall was hurriedly traced for me. I walked towards the stall,\
  \ and no later than I was certain of the details of the stall that disappointment\
  \ met me: an unappetizing slimy local catch of Pariga was on display and the fisher\
  \ nowhere in sight. It must have been my comical annoyance because a young boy appeared\
  \ out of dust and beckoned me to wait for the owner may be back any time now. \n\
  \nThe unexpectedly indulgent Egg Fried Rice at the stall rose in me a feeling of\
  \ gratitude towards the hazel-eyed, dark boy, and which after few exchanges transformed\
  \ in a bonhomie. After learning about the starved state of my scooter, he proposed\
  \ to give me a tour of his exclusive vantage point, atop a massive boulder, overlooking\
  \ the venerable spot from where Lord Rama aimed his arrow for Bali, as per the mythical\
  \ tales of Ramayana. \n\nIt must have been the soul-cleansing wind at that elevation\
  \ and the comfort of his pet-place, that the 11-year old broke unexpectedly his\
  \ tragic tale: \u201CThe stall was my uncle\u2019s. I run errands for food there.\u201D\
  \n\nFor the past 2 months, he had lived alone in Hampi while his elder brother was\
  \ struggling with life in a Bangalore hospital, accompanied by his parents. A massive\
  \ stray stone thrown by a drunk tourist had spotted his elder brother\u2019s head.\
  \ My attempts to give him any money for his services as a guide was declined, and\
  \ as if to reciprocate his trust in a stranger I recounted my real purpose in Hampi\
  \ with all sincerity. He seemed amused by my Dosa adventure, and I was relieved\
  \ to see his thoughtful smiles. My relief reached an unprecedented climax when he\
  \ said: \u201CCome to Srinivas Restaurant tomorrow morning for Masala Dosa. I can\u2019\
  t match my father\u2019s skill but at least it will be Srinivas\u2019s.\u201D"
