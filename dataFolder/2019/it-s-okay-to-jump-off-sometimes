Text: "Best Friend : \"Im going on an adventure , do you want to come?\"\n\nMe: \"\
  Hmmm... Let me think about it\"\n\nBest Friend: \"Oh, just saying.. I don't plan\
  \ on coming back home. MIA for good\"\n\nVery few stories start with an ultimatum\
  \ and actually get accomplished. \"Let's see what's in store\" I said to myself.\
  \ Our destination \nWas Uttrakhand, also known as the land where Lord Vishnu resides.\
  \ The whole state has banned alcohol and yet you will find piss drunk police men\
  \ walking on the roads of rishikesh enforcing a curfew which legally does not even\
  \ exist. We left home(Bangalore) and I even sent my mom my \"final message\" which\
  \ contained my final words for her. \nMy best friend and I were crazy... ACTUALLY\
  \ though haha\nThis ordeal didn't even seem too serious and we left with a happy\
  \ face but there was more to it. I wanted to understand the whole situation with\
  \ enlightenment while my best friend wanted to find a sage that could teach us.\
  \ \n\n~Moksha~\n\nWe reached Delhi first and the whole energy of letting go for\
  \ good placed us in such an alien pedestal. \nOur perception had become so clear\
  \ that it felt like I was in the wrong place most of the time. And that offsetting\
  \ place was anywhere commercial with it's conformist crowd. \nOne more funny occurrence\
  \ had taken us by surprise in the airport. They double checked us. Why, you might\
  \ think? \nWe had one suitcase and one backpack and all it contained were books\
  \ about Krishna. We didn't even think we might need to travel with a toothbrush.\
  \ People just didn't seem to understand these two eighteen year olds and to top\
  \ it we showed uninhibited symptoms of ADD. \n\nAnyways, we boarded a taxi and directly\
  \ headed towards joshmath (uttrakhand). The taxi driver was on codeine the whole\
  \ time and he surprisingly drove well. He even smoked the typical black poisend\
  \ marijuana they sell in Delhi which to my knowledge wasn't good news for us. We\
  \ did try some but meditated most of the time, in our heads. Whenever we got lucky\
  \ , we listened to \"spiritual healing\" by muses rapt and got our goosebumps. \n\
  \nHe dropped us at joshmath at 2:45am when all the shops, residences, and temples\
  \ were shut and to add on to the misfortune, it was raining. Mind you, we didn't\
  \ bring warm clothes so you could call us \"well unprepared\". \nWe said our goodbyes\
  \ to the driver and had our dinner (jeera rice and dal) with them. Only after 1-2\
  \ days did I realize I had forgotten the suitcase in the vehicle and he had already\
  \ gone back. And we didn't even feel bad as we had books in our backpack so the\
  \ entertainment and knnowledge part of our situation was backed up... Hmphhh \n\n\
  We sat under the aluminium roof of a shop and the kind gentleman who was probably\
  \ the owner,  offered us a good spot but it still didn't mitigate the unbearable\
  \ chills we faced. After 10 minutes of reading, we suddenly saw a man fighting a\
  \ dog. I have no idea what made me do what I did, but I went and asked him if he\
  \ had marijuana we could smoke. The next moment was dramatic, as I saw his hand\
  \ raised and the man started chasing us. We cooly walked away, ignoring him. \n\n\
  I have often seen that in the face of reccurent mishaps , with positivity and vigour\
  \ , help comes in ways that make us think \"yes destiny has it's way, the universe\
  \ helps , there is some positive in the negative, etc\" (compassion, love). A car\
  \ approached us and offered to take us to the gurudwara. We reached the Sikh temple\
  \ and saw many people sleeping inside but the guard threw a fit and we were back\
  \ again,  with our books, reading outside. He did eventually feel bad and let us\
  \ inside. We slept so well in those bed-buggd' mattresses. Finally , we overcame\
  \ our first obstacle with great success(sleep). We woke up early, looked at each\
  \ other, took our bags and headd towards badrinath. \n\nHow we live with challenges!?\
  \ \n\nIf you want to know more, give me more space to type haha. \n\n~peace~"
