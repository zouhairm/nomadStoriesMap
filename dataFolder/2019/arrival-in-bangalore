Text: "Stumbling off the airplane in Bangalore my friend and I followed the crowd\
  \ ahead of us. They joined a line, we did too. We were pointed to another line.\
  \ Overtired from a 13 hour journey from London, and 8 hours from Canada. \n\nTwenty\
  \ minutes later, luggage in hand, money converted to rupees, we exited the modest\
  \ airport to the early morning light and into a crowd of demanding taxi drivers,\
  \ vying to transport us to our next destination. We looked for the name of our ashram.\
  \ Seeing a bent cardboard sign with crooked letters, we smiled and greeted a young\
  \ man, assuming he was the messenger for the driver. He introduced himself as Kiran,\
  \ our driver. \n\n\u201CMeet me by that shack\u201D, he said. \u201CI parked far\
  \ away, I will come get you.\u201D He ran off. We went to the shack. We waited for\
  \ 15 minutes, wondering where he was. Eventually he arrived in an older jeep, dented\
  \ and painted to cover rust. He stowed our luggage. We crawled into the back seat,\
  \ searching for seatbelts. There were none.\n\nI looked at my friend. She was annoyed.\
  \ I shrugged my shoulders. I was giddy to be in India, a trip that had taken me\
  \ 30 years. I inhaled the smells, people and quiet of the morning. This is India,\
  \ I am here.\n\nKiran jumped in, slammed the door, started the engine and stepped\
  \ on the gas. Indian dance music blared from the speakers, he turned down the sound\
  \ and dialled his phone with one hand. He spoke quick and hung up, but not before\
  \ thumbing through his phone, selecting slow Indian music. Likely what he thought\
  \ people twice his age might like to listen to. \n\nDriving away from the airport\
  \ the streets were still quiet. At the side of the road, tea stands were being set\
  \ up. The first milk teas of the day were being prepared. After awhile, Kiran, asked\
  \ us if we wanted tea. We looked at each other. The thought of drinking roadside\
  \ tea first thing upon landing in India made my stomach clench a bit. I shook my\
  \ head.\n\nKiran pulled the jeep over, hopped out and lit a cigarette. He chatted\
  \ with an old man brewing tea and disappeared behind a shanty. I glanced around\
  \ the jeep - paper cups, snack bags, vinyl seats, dirty windows, not quite the vehicle\
  \ I pictured when the ride was arranged in the comfort of my dining room back in\
  \ Canada. I shifted in my seat, feeling sweat under my thighs. The windows were\
  \ down and that confirmed that there would be no AC on our journey.\n\nKiran appeared,\
  \ took the tea that the old man held out to him and drank it, handing the glass\
  \ back. He took a drag of his cigarette, dropping the butt in front of him, he stepped\
  \ on it as he jumped into the jeep. Starting the engine he did a quick shoulder\
  \ check and stepped on the gas pulling onto the highway. Traffic had started to\
  \ build up considerably since we had left the airport.\n\nMy friend fell asleep.\
  \ I did not want to sleep. The tea stands along the side of the highway stretched\
  \ on for a long time. Once they were gone then there were stands selling toothpaste,\
  \ chips and razors. The traffic was building. I thought I had seen painted traffic\
  \ lines on the road, but the drivers ignored the lines. Buses, tuktuks, cars, and\
  \ motorbikes all competed for space on the road, driving like they were all making\
  \ a mad dash to the finish line. Most of the vehicles carried two too many passengers,\
  \ I looked in fascination as a motorbike passed with an entire family onboard -\
  \ Dad, Mom, and three kids. \n\nBut, it was the colors that held my attention -\
  \ saris - orange, pink, yellow, red - billowing in the breeze on woman huddled together\
  \ in the backs of small trucks, on woman walking in groups of 2 or 3 on the side\
  \ of the road. Shimmering and brilliant against the dull shacks built from scraps\
  \ of wood and the dirt paths along on the side of the  road. This is India, I am\
  \ here."
