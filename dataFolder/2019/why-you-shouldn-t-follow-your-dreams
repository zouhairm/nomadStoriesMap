Text: "I got this passion for travel since I was a little girl. When I was 5yo I wrote\
  \ to Santa Claus asking for a Globe \U0001F30E that my parents couldn't have bought.\
  \ I was always dreaming about travel but my reality was completely different. Born\
  \ in a poor suburb of Brazil I grew up listening everyone saying I should follow\
  \ my dreams. When teenager I decided to study Tourism at University. I'm the younger\
  \ of my 3 siblings and no one that time had a degree before me.  I had to work 7\
  \ days per week to afford Uni and I thought I could finally start travel. But I\
  \ ended my university as poor as when I started. At age 23 I got a job at a big\
  \ Airline Company and even having a travel benefit (cheaper flight) I couldn't travel\
  \ for anywhere for the first 2 year just working for living. I worked for this company\
  \ for 6 years and apparently I was following my dreams. Yes! I did travel with them.\
  \ After the second year working there I had my first international flight (actually\
  \ the first travel in my whole life) and than some more flights until I realize\
  \ I was not exactly living my dreams. I was following this idea about one day I\
  \ going to go to explore the world, but this day was never coming. I was always\
  \ worried with no enough money, or how bad was my English and many other excuses.\
  \ Then finally I decided stop following my dreams to in fact live them. I quit my\
  \ job and even sure I had no enough money to travel around the globe I did it. I\
  \ travelled for one year doing all kind of casual jobs (cleaner, dog walker, waitress,\
  \ bartender) and now I am currently living in Australia. Improving my communication\
  \ skills in English and Seeking for a new opportunity such this one to keep inspiring\
  \ people to live their dreams."
