Text: "After an incredibly long flight from Paris. I jumped into my dream city, Bangkok,\
  \ by myself. As usual, I travelled abroad by myself and I was excited to meet new\
  \ friends and see new scenery. The first image of Bangkok was not that beautiful\
  \ due to smog caused by traffic fumes. However, once I took on a taxi, Bangkok became\
  \ just like paradise. \n\nI heard that Thai taxi drivers always try to cheat foreign\
  \ travellers and get more money. However, the taxi driver I met was definitely different.\
  \ He smiled and asked about where I am from and what I will do in Bangkok. I was\
  \ still afraid to talk to him but after a few minutes, I realized this driver will\
  \ not cheat and he is innocent and kind. In one hour, we became friends and shared\
  \ our numbers for the future. \n\nStarted with this kind taxi driver, I had a better\
  \ image and reached out to one guy on the bike. Still... I don't remember how we\
  \ started to talk but unbelievably we got on like a house on fire. He was a British\
  \ and came to Bangkok a few years ago and so confident that he is a real local.\
  \ \n\nI told him \"Alright! then show me around Bangkok as a local!\" He let me\
  \ ride behind his bike and showed me the local part of Bangkok. \n\nFirstly, we\
  \ went to a Chinese town. I have never imagined that I will go to the Chinese town\
  \ in Bangkok. I always try to go to local parts when I am travelling. I was a bit\
  \ disappointed but it was a real local place. There were many Thai locals who were\
  \ eating Chinese or Chinese-Thai fusion. Also, there were a bunch of shops in small\
  \ streets. As both of us were foreigners, some locals were staring at us. This made\
  \ me feel like I am not in a tourist district. After walking in the Chinese town.\
  \ We moved to a small restaurant. He told me the restaurant is his favourite one\
  \ and he used to come often when he lived near the restaurant. Even though the restaurant\
  \ was really small and I saw a rat on the floor, the foods were awesome and cheap.\
  \ About the rat, he said \"See! the rat also knows how foods are great!\" \n\nThe\
  \ sun went down and he said \"Today is my friend's birthday so I need to go there.\
  \ Do you want to join?\" I hesitated to join the party. I was not invited by his\
  \ friend and did not feel comfortable to meet too many strangers. I refused his\
  \ invitation and said goodbye to him. I went to a sky lounge bar alone and saw the\
  \ night view of Bangkok. Seeing the incredible view with a breeze made me feel relaxed\
  \ and refreshed. I wanted to share this feeling with my friends and him. I sent\
  \ pictures and got one response. It was already midnight so my friends were sleeping.\
  \ The response was from him.\n\n\"Hey! We moved to a bar! If you want to join, still\
  \ welcome.\" I was thinking about whether I will join or not. I was tired but also\
  \ drunk. After a few minutes of consideration, I decided to join him. It was such\
  \ an amazing night. His friends were as awesome as him. There were two girls and\
  \ two boys including him. One was a Japanese-Thai girl, another was an American-Polish\
  \ boy and the other was an American-Japanese girl. They lived in Bangkok for more\
  \ than five years so they had a lot of stories living in Thailand. Over the night,\
  \ I felt like I am a Thai local. Their stories made me I am in the stories and they\
  \ treated me as a friend. \n\nOne unexpected local friend showed me not only a local\
  \ area but also the local life of Bangkok. I hope I can meet him and his friends\
  \ one day in Paris or Seoul so that I can make him as a local in the city."
