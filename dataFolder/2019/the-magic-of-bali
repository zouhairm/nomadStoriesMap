Text: "I wake up to the familiar aroma of freshly cut flowers mixed with sandalwood\
  \ smoke. Even before I open my eyes, I know it's coming from a tiny but elaborate\
  \ arrangement of frangipani flowers, fresh fruit, and incense that magically appears\
  \ outside my villa every morning as an offering to the spirits that govern this\
  \ island paradise. This magic is the very essence of Bali, a place so deeply spiritual\
  \ and naturally beautiful they call it the Island of the Gods. \n\nThe Balinese\
  \ can hardly be blamed for believing their island was created by divine design.\
  \ From the perfectly sculpted rice terraces to the luscious green jungles, to the\
  \ vast Indian Ocean \u2013 everywhere you look there is immense natural beauty.\
  \ From my home base in Ubud I had easy access to the best parts of the island, but\
  \ I found that the spirit of Bali shines brightest in its people. Somehow, in this\
  \ day and age the Balinese manage to maintain the precarious balance between spiritual\
  \ and physical, family and community, action and consequence, while a lot of us\
  \ Westerners seem to have become disconnected from each other and from the natural\
  \ elements that surround and sustain us. \n\nOne day, as I wandered the emerald\
  \ green hills outside of Ubud, I ended up getting lost. Eventually, I came across\
  \ a man sitting in a rice field, busy sketching scenes of rural life. He was a farmer\
  \ resting after a day's work, doing what he loves in his spare time. After a while\
  \ and without a slightest sales pitch, I bought two of his drawings for practically\
  \ nothing and asked if he knew the best way back to Ubud. The man offered to take\
  \ me to a side road that led straight into town and proceeded to guide me through\
  \ the forest, past a couple of villages, in and out of ravines and across a very\
  \ questionable bridge that bent ominously underneath our weight. Quick and agile\
  \ on his feet, he kept offering to carry my bag \u2013 and at one point he even\
  \ offered to carry me! \u2013 as we were slipping and sliding down muddy jungle\
  \ paths and rice terraces filled with water. He assured me that once we got to the\
  \ road, it would be the most beautiful walk I'd done in Bali yet, but 30 minutes\
  \ into the hike and with no road in sight my Western mistrust kicked in. Would he\
  \ demand money for taking me on this detour? Was he planning to run off with my\
  \ camera? Or maybe he was taking me somewhere to get robbed? Just then, as we finished\
  \ crossing yet another wobbly bridge, he pointed upwards and said: \u201CThe road\
  \ is just up this hill. You'll see, it's really beautiful.\u201D With that, he smiled,\
  \ waved and disappeared back into the forest. The sun was making its way to the\
  \ horizon as I climbed up the hill through the tall green grasses swaying in the\
  \ breeze. The road at the top was indeed beautiful, the views perhaps more enchanting\
  \ than I\u2019d seen elsewhere on the island. I admired the scenery in silence,\
  \ ashamed for thinking the worst of the genuinely kind human who took the time out\
  \ of his day to show me the way and wanted absolutely nothing in return.\n\nThe\
  \ most beautiful thing about the Balinese is that they welcome visitors, but remain\
  \ firmly loyal to their way of life. Life revolves around family and community:\
  \ the elders take care of the children, and the adults take care of the elders.\
  \ Most of the food is locally grown or produced and entire families take to the\
  \ fields during the planting or harvesting season. On the whole, people seem very\
  \ much at peace here. Less afflicted. More present. So at dusk, as the thin wisps\
  \ of incense smoke once again rise in the air from the family compounds around my\
  \ villa and the island quickly plunges into the fragrant tropical night, I say a\
  \ little prayer that there be more places like this in the world. Less opportunistic.\
  \ More traditional. Places where even jaded Westerners still can, even temporarily,\
  \ believe in magic."
