Text: "Finding something new for yourself in a new place is always adventure. My last\
  \ trip to Europe had one of those remarkable moments that will be with you your\
  \ entire life. In Fall of 2018, my boyfriend and me set a goal to be together at\
  \ Christmas evening and the point of meeting was not about being together at that\
  \ exact date but more about finally reuniting our souls and the Christmas was the\
  \ best time when we were available. My soulmate is a student in the United Kingdom,\
  \ so we had to find a place that we both like and our choice without any doubt was\
  \ Barcelona. I think the middle of the winter time in Kazakhstan and the UK has\
  \ somehow affected to our choice. \n Because of some circumstances, I have arrived\
  \ at Barcelona three days earlier than my boyfriend. At first, because of my personality\
  \ of loving to explore, I took this fact as a new adventure. The realization that\
  \ I am not ready to explore and seek new things alone came to me as I left the airport.\
  \ Feeling alone in a city where you know no one and you are a thousand miles away\
  \ from your home not the feeling that I was expecting from my short trip. Feeling\
  \ homesick and missing my boyfriend led to crying at the streets of Barcelona. For\
  \ the person who rarely cries, it was realization your weakness and finding new\
  \ of yourself. \n While sitting in the bench and trying to calm myself, one man\
  \ came to me and offered a cigarette with a big smile on his face. This was the\
  \ best welcoming gesture of city in my life. At this moment, I felt like city of\
  \ Barcelona accepted me and opened its doors for me. I will never forget the smile\
  \ of that person and I would even call it \u2018smile of Barcelona\u2019. From that\
  \ moment I started to look around and adjust myself in a new country.\n Even though\
  \ some parts of the city were known as unsafe and Raval district was one of them,\
  \ I stopped in a hostel in Raval. While walking to the hostel I captured my thoughts\
  \ that I am not a weak person as I thought before. Choosing place to live in unsafe\
  \ place might somehow affected to my self-esteem. In one day, I have experienced\
  \ so many different feelings and found new myself that is the beauty of traveling.\
  \ With this though I fell asleep in a new country. \n At the next day, I found myself\
  \ in a hostel among many different young people who were living in that hostel.\
  \ They were generous and kind. All of them were travelers and we had beautiful breakfast\
  \ where we became acquainted. This is another enormous advantage of traveling which\
  \ is uniting people from all over the world and we must admire that. With this though\
  \ I started to explore Barcelona. City fascinate me with its relaxed rhythm of the\
  \ city and beautiful architecture of buildings. What can be better of having a beer\
  \ in a bar where Einstein and Gaudi used to drink, and beautiful museums left unforgettable\
  \ impressions as well. \nNext day, I had a walk to the main and central square Plaza\
  \ Catalunya, and with this place, I had a meaningful story. The square of Barcelona\
  \ was full of pigeons, kids, and adults who were feeding them. Different nationalities\
  \ were interacting with each other and kids were playing with each other. I understand\
  \ that each city can be a home for everyone and this is the real meaning of word\
  \ World citizen. \nBarcelona is a mixture of history and art, young and old people,\
  \ tourists and citizens, sea and mountains. Museums and masterpieces of Gaudi are\
  \ everywhere. Moreover, each district of Barcelona has their own soul and even way\
  \ of life. In three days in Barcelona, I did not expect to find that I can learn\
  \ about myself more than in last decade of my life and this is the beauty of exploring\
  \ new places."
