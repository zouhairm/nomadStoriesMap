Text: This is not travel story from same beautiful place.This is my small trip to
  a market.That placed in Delhi,India near to my house.In India there is not's so
  many mall.So if you want some vegetables and fruits you have to go that's market.That
  places are filled with temporary shop's.In day light this place a road filled with
  wheels.but after sunlight, this place become a place filled with shop owners and
  people those are come here to buy some stuff.You think that's a vegetables market
  but you can find many more thing's and product that made by local person's.I was
  very depressed that night so I decided to stay out side that night.I was middle
  of the market seeing faces of people who come's here to buy something.Every shopkeeper
  is shouting there prices aloo 30 rupe kilogram pyaj 40 rupe  kilogram (Potato Rs
  30 kg onions 40 per kg).And that's sound shows frustration of every shopkeeper.
  Then a man passed by me who left his cigarette smoke on my face.That made me very
  angry and i m turn around  to stop him.But i can't find him because.There are not
  only one man smoking.In that market there are so many smoker.So i forget about that
  and start waking towards to end of the market.That time i realize that no cares
  why are you here, to buy something or just passing that road.And i can't  do anything
  about that.Both side of the roads filled with temporary shops  of vegetables and
  fruits.There are some shop of Tomato,Potato,Oranges,Mangoes,Grapes and Guava.And
  some shops of Indian street food like chole bhature,tikki,golgappe and Indian style
  burger.and after all shops i m finally reached the end of the market.That place
  was very empty because there are not street lights.So many people not come here.And
  i m come here to spend my all night with some darkness and doggies.I placed myself
  in darkness and start waiting for sunrise.
