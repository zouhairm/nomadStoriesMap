Text: "Easter holidays at last. Tough year behind us, that is, for my partner and\
  \ I. Left the car rental parking in Barcelona early and we had, at least, 800 kilometres\
  \ ahead of us. Slightly old-fashioned, we had prepared some mixed tapes which were\
  \ of absolutely no use in our white twelve-kilometre-old cinquecento. What\u2019\
  s a road trip without a mixed tape?\n\nBilbao. Santander. Comillas. Oviedo.\n\n\
  As we drove south-east, we realized our destination had an almost-impossible access.\
  \ We drove, nonetheless, through the pass of La Hermida: narrow, throat-like incisions\
  \ made by the river Deva proved to be the reason for the meandering road and the\
  \ massive walls which contained it.\n\nNational Park de los Picos de Europa. Zepa\
  \ de Li\xE9bana.\n\nWe passed Potes, the comarca\u2019s capital, and after a few\
  \ kilometres we took an exit which would lead us past Vada and straight to Villaverde.\
  \ Our GPS decided it would be great to send us right up a road: one of those roads\
  \ which make you really question the accuracy of Google\u2019s information. It insisted:\
  \ yes, through there, yes, go, go, go. The cinquecento roared furiously as it tried\
  \ to create traction out of thin air, rubber and gasoline. \u201CBe quiet!\u201D\
  \ I snapped at Google. I went against Google\u2019s indications. Reverse. Think.\
  \ \u201CThere has to be another way.\u201D \u201CBut, look, there are no roads which\
  \ lead to the shelter.\u201D \u201CThere must be, Luis, Google\u2019s not God.\u201D\
  \n\nThere was only one other road. New. Signaled. It was barely one-hundred metres\
  \ long but it wandered winding towards somewhere. Parked the car. Silence. Three\
  \ in the afternoon. Not a soul in sight, just a spring breeze. A little girl comes\
  \ walking along the road with a backpack: she\u2019s coming back from school. We\
  \ looked around. Six or seven houses perched on the hillside. \u201CHola,\u201D\
  \ she said. \u201CHola,\u201D we replied. Then, she asked if we were staying at\
  \ Manolo\u2019s shelter. We looked at each other: \u201CS\xED.\u201D \u201CEs por\
  \ ah\xED,\u201D she said as she pointed towards the road which continued for just\
  \ a few more steps. She smiled: we smiled and walked towards Manolo\u2019s shelter.\n\
  \n\u201CHola\u2026 Hola\u2026\u201D \u201CHola, bienvenidos, vosotros sois Luis\
  \ y Sabrina, \xBFno es cierto?\u201D \u201CY t\xFA, \xBFManolo?\u201D \u201CS\xED\
  , encantado.\u201D\n\nWe were the only guests. We had beaten the Easter turmoil\
  \ just for a couple of days. He walked us around and introduced us to Yoli, a Venezuelan\
  \ woman who helped him run the shelter, married to one of the nineteen people who\
  \ were known to live in Villaverde permanently, according to the last census. Luis\
  \ said hello and asked how she was doing: she gasped, took her hands to her mouth\
  \ and asked in utter disbelief if Luis was Venezuelan too. He is. And just like\
  \ that we became her little chickens: she walked with us too. We stopped by the\
  \ house and farm of two ninety-year-old brothers who were ploughing a small parcel\
  \ of earth manually. I asked what they were planting. \u201CPatata. Mucha, mucha\
  \ patata.\u201D I asked if they felt that, maybe, they needed something else aside\
  \ potato. They laughed in unison.\n\nWe stayed three nights: helped in the kitchen,\
  \ played chess with Manolo, folded sheets, climbed up mountains. As we were coming\
  \ back from one of our hikes, we could hear people talking, rumours that echoed\
  \ in this vast valley. About ten people gathered on the edge of the road: probably\
  \ that was the total number of people in a ten kilometre radius.\n \nA cow had died.\
  \ Natural causes. Big event.\n\nWe decided that same night we would stay for four\
  \ more nights, but Manolo didn\u2019t have enough beds for the weekend. He offered\
  \ us an apartment instead: an apartment reserved for family visits. We said yes,\
  \ thank you.\n\nYes, to the big events in life: cooking, playing chess, folding\
  \ sheets, climbing up mountains, planting potatoes and discussing the best way of\
  \ burying a cow."
