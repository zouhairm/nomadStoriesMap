Text: "I look out of the window of the small restaurant and see a hotel with the symbolic\
  \ Bukhara architecture. Adjacent to the front door is written in fuzzy white neon\
  \ lights, \u201CHotel New Moon.\u201D Unlike the historic stone exterior of the\
  \ hotel, the name appears to be quite modern and flashy. My empty stomach does not\
  \ let me focus on the view as I am attacked by occasional hunger pangs. Cloudy visuals\
  \ of the plov that I ordered, engulf my mind and add to my psychological torment.\
  \ With long grained rice cooked slowly with carrots, onions in saut\xE9ed garlic\
  \ and topped with meat, the mere thoughts of this exceptional Uzbek dish is enough\
  \ to stimulate my salivary glands into action.   \nI turn around and spot an aged\
  \ lady behind the counter arranging food in the trays for a younger girl who appears\
  \ to be the waitress. They have an uncanny resemblance, and I assume them as a mother-daughter\
  \ pair. The waitress serves the table to my left and then puts a plate in front\
  \ of me in a hastened manner before moving to the next one. \nI look at the plate\
  \ carefully. I had let my expectations too high; there are just a few titbits of\
  \ horse meat on the otherwise steaming irresistible rice. I should have guessed\
  \ it as horse meat is not eaten in abundance. Anyway, I taste a spoonful of the\
  \ plov. The delectable taste of the spices, soft raisins and sliced carrots melt\
  \ in my mouth. I call for the waitress to ask her in a mixed lingo of broken Uzbek\
  \ and gestures for tomato ketchup. I notice her having trouble in grasping what\
  \ I am telling her, so I let her know that it\u2019s alright I won\u2019t need it.\
  \ What a surprise that the Uzbeks aren\u2019t aware of the use of ketchup like the\
  \ rest of us are. \nShe leaves to return again with her mother who looks towards\
  \ me in a considerate manner. The waitress signals me to explain my demand to her\
  \ mother. I wish to tell them that it\u2019s alright as I know that further communication\
  \ would not be of much use. But out of respect for their concern, I start again.\
  \ The elderly lady listens attentively, nodding in between. After I have told them,\
  \ they walk away leaving me in an awkward silence; allowing me to wonder about the\
  \ scenario I have created. \nI indulge on my rice and a couple of moments later,\
  \ both of them return with the mother carrying a small bowl in her hand. She places\
  \ it on the table and smiles in an assuring way. Behind her, her daughter beams\
  \ in accomplishment. I take a look in the small blue bowl. I am greeted by a rose\
  \ red liquid of a thick consistency with small white seeds floating on the mixture.\
  \ Tiny bubbles indicating mashing and mixing can be seen on the surface. It takes\
  \ me a few moments to realise what has happened. In hope of getting for me what\
  \ I wanted, these gracious ladies have mashed tomatoes and prepared a sauce for\
  \ me. The unavailability of ketchup wasn\u2019t an excuse to bring an ounce of dissatisfaction\
  \ to their customer. I am out of words as I wasn\u2019t expecting this lagniappe.\
  \ I try my best to express my gratitude towards them. They seem content and leave,\
  \ letting me know that if I need anything else they will be present. \nI pour some\
  \ sauce on my rice and chew on a morsel softly, relishing the tangy taste of the\
  \ sauce in my mouth. Plov is considered an exquisite and special dish in Uzbekistan\
  \ due to its wide consumption and rich taste. However, I want to mention that it\
  \ is the hospitality of the Uzbeks that make it special. Surely, the language of\
  \ concern and goodwill is universal and understood by everyone alike."
