Text: "Unplanned journey is always the best one because its planned by god himself\
  \  . Our family and friends we all decided to visit desert of kachh in gujrat and\
  \ after the whole trip planned driver of our journey decide not to join . That killed\
  \ whole plan I was a little happy about that because without driver who know desert\
  \ very well you cant travel in desert . \n     so then we decide to visit local\
  \ tourism place and tample for holidays . We started from Surendranagar temple of\
  \ devi , we took lunch and then visited some other famous temple like pipali and\
  \ dudhrej . We spent night at pipali .\n        At dawn we  continued journey by\
  \ visiting patadi , tample of lord Swaminarayan which is 30-35 kilometres away from\
  \ pipali , my father is religious person so it was heaven for him but it was boring\
  \ for me and my friends . I had thought our holidays were ruined but then miracle\
  \ took place . \n        One strange person from local inform us that desert of\
  \ kuchh is not far from patadi, still it was boring for me I was just homesick .\
  \ But there was no any options , we managed driver for travel in desert , it was\
  \ costly and we didn't expect or do any plan for that journey so we all ten persons\
  \ fitted in small car , which was in our budget and then the journey to unexpect\
  \ was begun . \n           We were on our way playing games and singing in crowded\
  \ vehicle then driver stopped car at the edge of desert and adviced to watch about\
  \ our water and food condition . We refilled it and entered in dhrangadhra wildlife\
  \ sanctuary which is sanctuary for Asiatic wild Ass . \n          During the way\
  \ changing of colour of land were work like milestones which placed by nature ,\
  \ first colour of soil convert  black to yellowish but still there was a farm or\
  \ place for agriculture , distance after distance soil start convert in sand , farms\
  \ convert in self grown cactuses and this whole things was changing my mind from\
  \ boredom to excitement .\n      There is business of salt farming so salt was spread\
  \ on land for kilometres looks like the surface of moon . As we reached some distance\
  \ in to desert everything was just vanished . It was looked like there is nothing\
  \ exist in this world except for me . Complete vulnerable to nature and extreme\
  \ solitude. \n         In that journey i found the totally different view of nature\
  \ ,i gave my own definition to desert  \"its forest which dont have trees \""
