Text: "\u2018Please ma\u2019am come with me\u2019 is a magic sentence that i don\u2019\
  t like to hear specially at the airport. I got that sentence couple of times since\
  \ i have arrived in Europe nine years ago. But this one time at Athens Airport i\
  \ won\u2019t forget. I just got through a metal detector and there wasn't any sound\
  \ came from it. I should have just continue walked through it but two women officers\
  \ came to me and said that i should go with them. I asked why and got no answer.\
  \ They brought me to a special station and of course they found nothing.\n\n\n\n\
  After that everything went well and i arrived an hour later in Santorini. I got\
  \ asked again and had to show them hotel reservation also called the hotel to make\
  \ sure that i would stay there. I tried not to get irritated.\n\n\n\nThe landscape\
  \ on the way to the hotel was surprisingly irregular and peacefully at the same\
  \ time where there are green hills with beautiful meadows around. I have never seen\
  \ this kind of view in my life even though i come from tropical country where rainforests\
  \ are our signature.\n\n\n\nSantorini is sure one of the most beautiful Island in\
  \ the world and i proved it just right. In fact that the concept of a city on a\
  \ hill with white and blue painted half circle roof buildings was new for me and\
  \ also equally important is the dramatic view of the blue crystal water of the Aegean\
  \ Sea. \n\n\nI was all drowning in my own thoughts at a touristy coffee shop near\
  \ tourist information center while some random man approached me and asked weird\
  \ questions. At first he complimented me about the way i dress but then questioned\
  \ me with \u2018Where do you come from?\u2019, \u2018Why do you use that hat?\u2019\
  , \u2018Do people in your country wear the same item of clothing like you?\u2019\
  . I know the answers of those questions by heart because a lot people have already\
  \ asked it before. I was on holiday and so fascinated with the view of the island,\
  \ so i answered him nicely and then we talked about 10 minutes.\n\n\n\nI strolled\
  \ around Thira that afternoon for couple hours before i had to catch up a bus to\
  \ see sunset in Oia. Surprisingly for me, there were many donkeys with bell collars\
  \ in the city. I think they suppose to help people get to the upper side of the\
  \ hills.  While i was walking through those alleys, a lot of souvenir shops owner\
  \ have mistaken me as chinese tourists for the way they greeted me \u2018Ni hao\u2019\
  . I smiled and laughed despite that i knew there were a few people who stared at\
  \ me. There weren't so many girls who looked like me and i could easily relate to\
  \ it because i remember that feeling when a group of caucasians tourists came to\
  \ our small town back home. Everyone did stare at them just because they were different.\
  \ \n\n\n\ni let that go and  did continue to walk since nothing that i could do.\n\
  \n\n\nThe most unforgettable part of my stay in Santorini was that evening in Oia\
  \ just before sunset. I have always been a sunrise lover but that view of sunset\
  \ in Oia was really undoubtedly worth the wait and long travel from home. i didn't\
  \ even take a single picture of it. \n\n\n\nAfter four days of walking around the\
  \ island and enjoying the beaches i had to leave Santorini. And of course i had\
  \ to face airport securities again. But this time i told myself to not make that\
  \ a big deal of it. So my journey back to home was perfectly smooth. There were\
  \ no \u2018Please ma\u2019am come with me\u2019 anymore , no double-check passport\
  \ and visa. \n\n\n\nI learned a lot from this journey. You would see and find many\
  \ things during your journey to new places that you have never seen yet in your\
  \ whole life. You would realise that people are born with kindness and empathy if\
  \ we would take the effort to understand them. And i would continue to be kind even\
  \ though sometimes people treats me differently because of my hijab."
