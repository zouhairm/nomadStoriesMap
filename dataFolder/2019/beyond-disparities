Text: "While traveling alone, I\u2019ve always met a lot of people who have turned\
  \ from Strangers to close friends. These are mostly people I meet in Hostels, or\
  \ other travelers I find along the way. But never before did I find a local connect\
  \ which turned into a friendship beyond barriers until I stumbled upon Roshan Bhaiya\
  \ (Brother) while I was in Old Manali, a town in the picturesque Himalayas. \n\n\
  It was my first time in Manali, which is a popular place in Himachal especially\
  \ for the Indians. The touristy Manali is also accompanied by a not so touristy\
  \ town called 'Old Manali' which is known for its hippie culture and cafes, music\
  \ and colorful shops. \n\nTo reach Old Manali, I had to cross a small red bridge,\
  \ the known separator yet connector between Old and New sides of Manali. \nThe first\
  \ building on the left as soon as I entered Old Manali, was the Hostel where I was\
  \ staying, which was surrounded with cafes. \n\nI reached late in the evening and\
  \ went to have dinner in one of the popular cafes around, which to my disappointment\
  \ was crowded and loud. Having lived in New Delhi my entire life, Himachal for me\
  \ has been a place where I always find my calm, beyond the continuous noise and\
  \ humdrum of my city life. So when I saw a similar vibe in this caf\xE9, without\
  \ anyone sober in sight to have a conversation, I felt like something was missing\
  \ and I wondered what exactly was \u2018Old\u2019 in this side of Manali, which\
  \ rather felt new and developed, suited for a city life. \n\nThe next morning I\
  \ decided to look around for that missing piece and started walking aimlessly. I\
  \ paved my way through narrow and steep lanes, unfolding the surroundings around\
  \ me, one step at a time. After walking for a good twenty minutes, the cafes on\
  \ my way were replaced with bright and colorful local houses, all single story buildings.\
  \ These buildings were rustic and old, and yet were proud symbols of cultural legacy.\
  \ Around these houses, the elders were busy doing their usual chores, and the children\
  \ were playing. The way was still filled with music, but of a different kind this\
  \ time, from the laughter of the children and the conversations between elders.\
  \ \n\nSoaking all this in and filled with joy, I moved ahead. I finally reached\
  \ the end of a concrete lane and walked into what looked like a \u2018road less\
  \ taken\u2019. By this point my legs were tired, and I was out of breath. That is\
  \ when, as if it was all meant to be, I finally reached the end of this road and\
  \ saw a petite Tea Stall, which mind you, offered the best views.\n\nThat is where\
  \ I met Roshan Bhaiya for the first time. He made Chai (Tea) for me and I was the\
  \ only customer at his not so popular and hidden tea stall, and that is how, the\
  \ two of us started talking to each other with the best mountain views, a river\
  \ stream, cold winds, and the hot chai with dogs by our side.\n\nFor all the remaining\
  \ days that I was in Manali, I used to walk for forty minutes each day to have my\
  \ morning tea at Roshan Bhaiya\u2019s tea stall, which became my comfort spot. I\
  \ was also invited to his house one day, where I met his family and shared a local\
  \ specialty dish, \u2018Rajmah\u2019 which was prepared using fresh vegetables from\
  \ their own farm. \n\nWe shared and spoke of our different lives and it was the\
  \ beginning of a friendship which was beyond any barrier, and the superficial differences\
  \ between us. Even though we were very different people in terms of the places we\
  \ came from, the languages we spoke, the clothes we wore, the way we lived, or the\
  \ cultures we grew in, yet a relationship was weaving with honesty and conversations,\
  \ beyond disparities. \n\nThis is how my disappointment from this town turned into\
  \ a beautiful surprise, and in the end, I did find my missing piece in Roshan Bhaiya\
  \ and his family, as they gave me a home away from home."
