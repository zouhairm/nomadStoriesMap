Text: "\"You can get your heart broken or..... you could have the greatest love affair\
  \ the world has ever known,\" I daydreamed of a perfect love story with my eyes\
  \ glued to my cellphone screen watching 'When in Rome' as I relaxed in bed after\
  \ a long day's work. Teaching is a demanding profession, but it does give you that\
  \ window to breathe and rejuvenate during summers. Spring had just started in Delhi\
  \ and my mind was blooming with ideas for my next travel destination during my 2-month\
  \ long summer break. Bollywood and Hollywood have their strange ways of enticing\
  \ dreamy beings like me, Italy it was.\nShopping wonderland, gelato heaven, architectural\
  \ delight and a happy hunting ground for men. Needless to say, I had a tough time\
  \ choosing my first stop.\nGoogle maps led me to Corso Buenos Aires where I managed\
  \ to shop for more bags than I could pack- even Plain Jane could go insane with\
  \ Prada, Gucci alluring you from all sides of Corso di Ticense. My tired feet needed\
  \ some more exercise the next morning, and my desire to live like a local drew me\
  \ to the grassy and leafy, Parco Sempione for a 7k. My Milano experience also comprised\
  \ of admiring the Duomo and the Castle museum, but the joy of shopping from the\
  \ fashion capital was unforgettable. The posh city also had its share of polished\
  \ men showing me around - one being an Italian lawyer.\nNext stop was Florence -\
  \ an engineered masterpiece. I didn't want to blink as I walked through the streets,\
  \ knowing I would miss something worthwhile. Was there a need to visit the museums\
  \ when the whole city looked like one? Maybe yes! I started by visiting Museo di\
  \ Galileo with the idea of educating myself (being a primary teacher) and that is\
  \ when I realized - solo travelling is bliss. I took my own sweet time understanding\
  \ Galileo\u2019s inventions and discoveries. Magnetised by museums, next I found\
  \ myself appreciating the wonderful pieces in the Modern Art Museum. It was probably\
  \ the only museum which was peaceful (considering I was the only one there) because\
  \ the next site was a place I wouldn't advise anyone to miss, Uffizi gallery. Capturing\
  \ everything using every possible camera I had, ambling down the treasured rooms.\
  \ Every showpiece is etched in my mind's eye, even after 2 long years. Did Florence\
  \ have someone to show me around? Yes, yet another charming Italian man. The country\
  \ gloats about its men, and rightly so!\nI was to leave for Rome the next morning,\
  \ but I took a huge risk- challenged time! Yes, an early morning train to Pisa,\
  \ confident that I would be back in time for my Flixbus to Rome. Racing against\
  \ time, I got a slightly longer than a glimpse of the Leaning Tower of Pisa with\
  \ a few illusional photos for my \u2018traveller\u2019 Instagram account. Hurriedly,\
  \ I left for the bus which comes right outside the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but unfortunately\
  \ I missed it. I had done half marathons earlier, this was just a 23 minute walk\
  \ to the Pisa train station, so I ran and walked, hoping someone would give me a\
  \ lift on the way (no one did, they probably thought I was drugged, running around\
  \ without any sense of direction). I knew I had missed my train and was prepared\
  \ to book another one. As I arrived at the station, I noticed the black digital\
  \ screen flashing a 15-minute delay and I was on track once again.\nAll roads lead\
  \ to Rome! A terrific evening with a complete Italian stranger who walked me through\
  \ a secluded street to a spot from where I got the most spectacular view of the\
  \ city (I also learnt to trust strangers). The following days I explored the city\
  \ \u2013 the Spanish steps (seems overhyped), Villa Borghese, Campo Feurri, Bocca\
  \ Della Verita, the Pantheon, Orange Garden and the secret keyhole. One night I\
  \ found myself throwing coins in the enchanting Trevi, and the next I was with him\
  \ \u2013 sitting outside St.Peter\u2019s Basilica talking about life\u2019s ups\
  \ and downs. A tourist like me, I met in Rome, and my soon to be husband!\nPompeii\
  \ and Napoli follow."
