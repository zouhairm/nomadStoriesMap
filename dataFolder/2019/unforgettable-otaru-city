Text: "I was traveling to Otaru in 2018. Do you know Otaru? Otaru is a little city\
  \ in Hokkaido, Japan. when I came to Otaru, I'm using JR, JR is Train in Hokkaido.\
  \ and there was an amazing view, you will never sleepy on the train because the\
  \ view it's so amazing. when you come out of the Otaru Station you will see a really\
  \ nice view, this city around a mountain and sea. The first day  I'm going to the\
  \ music box museum, in front of the museum there is a big clock, and when at 12\
  \ o'clock will make a sound like a train in the past year \"tuut tutt\". Inside\
  \ the music box museum there so many different music box and you can make your own\
  \ favorite music inside the music box, there was an amazing experience. \nAfter\
  \ that I'm going to a glass museum, in here you can make your own glass strap, the\
  \ teacher helps you make it, so don't worry if you don't understand how to make\
  \ it. I really like it here because you can do many experiences at a low price.\
  \ I can speak Japanese so it makes me more comfort when I traveling to Japan. But\
  \ don't worry if you can't speak Japanese, the Japanese people will help you there\
  \ are so kind. \nThe best one I like when I traveling is I can taste the original\
  \ food from some country. The best one in here is NARUTO CHICKEN, its so delicious,\
  \ big and cheap. I eat in this restaurant twice because I can't forget the taste.\
  \ \nin the second day I'm going to Otaru Aquarium, this place so amazing, you can\
  \ see penguins going to sea to play and you can watch another performer on the beach.\
  \ this is unforgettable memories. \nafter that, I'm going to buy some chocolate\
  \ and cheese to take it home. Hokkaido has the best cheese ever, cheesecake in here\
  \ really delicious, I can eat more than twice, I think I'm going fat in here *LOL*.\
  \  In Japan, there so many interesting you can buy and take it home, because they're\
  \ so many unique items in here, and they have many different flavors for any kind\
  \ of food. \nThe famous place is CANAL, you can take a good photo in here, especially\
  \ in the winter season so beautiful I can't explain it. and if you going in winter\
  \ season you can go to Yuki matsuri or snow festival. \nIn here you can rent a bike\
  \ too, so you can ride a bike around the city and take some pictures in here. you\
  \ must eat seafood in here but the price little bit expensive but the taste, oh\
  \ my god I can't lie, it's so delicious. \nI stay at some guest house just for woman\
  \ only, it's so clean and quite it's so comfortable."
