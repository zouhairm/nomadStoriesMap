Text: "I was only two years old when my family left Kenya in pursuit of a better life\
  \ and a better future for my brother and I, in Canada. Although I left at a very\
  \ young age, my heart always stayed in Kenya. It wasn\u2019t until many years later\
  \ when I was 18 years old \u2013 the age at which a Masai warrior would be sent\
  \ out to defeat a lion to claim his manhood \u2013 that I first realized why my\
  \ heart could be stranded in such a far-off land. \nI stepped out of the small,\
  \ tattered plane that somehow survived the flight from Nairobi to Lodwar and immediately\
  \ felt the sweltering heat overcome me. I felt the burn of the North Kenyan Sun\
  \ on my skin and felt the warm dry air fill my chest with every breath I took in.\
  \ I looked around past the \u201Cairport\u201D \u2013 which was really just two\
  \ small concrete buildings \u2013  and saw nothing but red earth and scorched brown\
  \ grass. I wondered how anyone could survive on such an arid landscape. \nMy uncle\
  \ and I then gathered ourselves into a tiny grey car and began the last leg of our\
  \ journey. We drove through a local village and this was where my amazement began.\
  \ I was no average city slicker from Ottawa, Canada, I was a born Kenyan and I had\
  \ been all around the wildernesses of Mara and the streets of Nairobi, but this\
  \ was like nothing I had ever seen. For the first time in my life, I truly witnessed\
  \ the amalgamation of ancient cultures and new technologies. I saw a man dressed\
  \ in nothing but a loin cloth carrying a straw bag over his shoulder and holding\
  \ a cell phone in his hand, an image I will never forget. \nFinally, we arrived\
  \ at our destination and this was where I saw my grandfather\u2019s, my father\u2019\
  s, and now my own legacy unveiled before me. Growing up I was told stories of the\
  \ school for orphans that my grandfather had built many years ago but it was always\
  \ a far-off picture of something out of a national geographic magazine. I was now\
  \ in the magazine. We were immediately greeted by a rush of school children, all\
  \ dressed in matching uniforms, their smiles shining from ear to ear. My uncle pulled\
  \ out a box of candy from his bag and handed it to me; \u201Chere\u201D he said,\
  \ \u201Cgive them this candy but make sure they line up and only take one at a time\u201D\
  . He spoke as though they were his own children, and this is because they are. Over\
  \ the course of our two days in Lodwar I would learn that they are my children as\
  \ well. As I handed each little boy and girl a piece of candy, I saw their eyes\
  \ light up with a pure, innocent joy that amazed me. I asked myself if I ever found\
  \ such happiness in something so simple and it truly dawned on me the extent to\
  \ which I took my luxurious middle class Canadian life for granted. These children\
  \ did not have videogames or the newest toys, in fact they didn\u2019t even have\
  \ air conditioning, but what they did have was innocence and happiness. I suddenly\
  \ felt a tear roll down my cheek, not out of disappointment in myself but contrarily\
  \ out of pride in my family. The happiness in the hearts of these children was there\
  \ because of the hard work and dedication my family put into building and maintaining\
  \ this school. We give the children food, clothing, a roof over their heads, and\
  \ most importantly an education. I finally saw firsthand the good that can be done\
  \ in this world. That sense of pride was immediately followed by a sense of responsibility\
  \ and as though he could read my mind, my uncle turned to me and said, \u201CIt\
  \ is the responsibility of our family to always take care of these children. Never\
  \ forget that no matter where you are this world, you must honour your grandfather\u2019\
  s legacy\u201D."
