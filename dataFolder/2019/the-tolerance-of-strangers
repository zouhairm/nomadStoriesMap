Text: "He's been in front the whole way, his long panga swiping at the foliage with\
  \ one hand, the other reserved for making signals like a part-time shadow puppeteer.\
  \ We've figured that a fist means stop and a wave means come. Or go away. It's hard\
  \ to tell. He doesn't speak English, or any other language I can understand, but\
  \ he does speak the language of gorillas. And that is why we are here.\nUganda's\
  \ Impenetrable Rainforest isn't as famous as it's French-speaking neighbour's. The\
  \ name alone is enough to put most people off. But after travelling through the\
  \ wrinkling heat and soggy perils of Africa's most inaccessible parts without seeing\
  \ anything bigger than a leaf, I think I may know another reason why. \nEnoch, our\
  \ guide, holds up another of his trademark hand gestures and our 3-person convoy\
  \ stops to assess the danger. Underfoot, we balance on a carpet of vines, slick\
  \ like greasy noodles and just as knotted. There's a mist under the forest's canopy\
  \ that creates a nebulous landscape of tiered trees and impassable inclines: the\
  \ same way it's been since our trek began this morning five hours ago, but danger\
  \ is still nowhere to be seen.\nAfter a moment, Enoch continues and Serena and I\
  \ dutifully follow. Must stick to the path.\nEnoch can walk over the rotten debris\
  \ of the rainforest's slimy floor like it's an athletics track, while Serena and\
  \ I trip, slide and stumble our way to keep up. He isn't even out of breath when\
  \ we stop (infrequently, and usually only to sniff excrement), whereas I puff, pant\
  \ and sweat, wet enough to pass for a recently emerged diver.\n\"I need to stop,\"\
  \ says Serena, removing bindweed from her jacket. She sits down against a damp,\
  \ rotten log. It bows with the lament of wet wood under her weight causing a split\
  \ to open. For the first time Enoch looks worried and the reason why becomes immediately\
  \ clear. Danger found. A throng of small black bees takes to the air filling the\
  \ mist with shadow, searching for the intruders. Serena hears the insect's unmistakable\
  \ buzz alarm before she's even seen the danger and is already up and darting away\
  \ from the log. They flit through the undergrowth and evergreens, quickly swarming\
  \ us and finding that our full body waterproofs are no disguise for the vulnerable\
  \ skin underneath. One after the other needle spears pierce our clothes as we run\
  \ through the forest along the path of least resistance to get away.\nThe bees are\
  \ persistent. We run for minutes before we're able to stop, having lost all but\
  \ a few. With flailing arms and throbbing stings, I look around assessing the area\
  \ we've run into. Not ten metres away are the candid eyes of a bear sized mountain\
  \ gorilla looking straight back at me. At last! It scans our movements unperturbed\
  \ by our presence, it's mouth wrapped around a shoot held by an enormous hand on\
  \ an arm flaunting muscles that bully themselves away from a bursting chest.\nEnoch\
  \ seems as surprised as anybody. He holds his hands palm-up by his chest, his shoulders\
  \ shrugging. Luck. The first gesture I've really understood. \nThis gorilla, placid\
  \ and majestic, has the strength to rip us limb from limb at any moment if it wanted,\
  \ and with good reason. Both the immediate area and the world around these gorillas\
  \ is on the brink of war. Political unrest and the belief that the gorillas are\
  \ the treasurers of large oil deposits threatens their habitat. Poaching has left\
  \ only 800 in the world. Soon there will be no visitors allowed in these regions\
  \ at all.\nAs we stand eye-to-eye, it's free arm casually waving away the last tenacious\
  \ bees we've brought into its midst, I'm reminded that we weren't even invited into\
  \ its home. The tolerance of this gorilla is astonishing\u2014when everyone around\
  \ seems to be fighting one another for space, money, dominance\u2014it remains unfazed.\n\
  If only we could all show the same tolerance of strangers when they walk into our\
  \ lands, I think: how infinitely more we might learn. How infinitely more we might\
  \ understand. How much more peaceful we might all live."
