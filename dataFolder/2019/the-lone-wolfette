Text: "She walked the streets unknown of her destination. The city older than realized\
  \ but beaming with vitality. Wondering, do they see me or am I as invisible as I\
  \ feel? Longing for a connection, meaning to this complex life, she touched the\
  \ buildings with their mosaic appearance. Smooth, rough, bumpy and jagged, much\
  \ like her heart. This city seemed to get her in a way that her birthplace did not.\
  \ Was I from here in a previous life, she wondered. Why does it seem so foreign\
  \ and familiar all in one breath. How do I know where I\u2019m going when I\u2019\
  ve never been here before? \n\nShe sat down at a local cafe and pulled a cigarette\
  \ from the pack, looking out on the street where people were busy living their lives.\
  \ Happiness from head to toe, carelessly moving with the sounds of a guitar in the\
  \ background. The sun shined so brightly and the smell of paella wafted in the background.\
  \ How can anyone feel less than pleasure at any moment? All the senses overwhelmed\
  \ with beauty. Do they know what they have or have they become numb to their worlds.\n\
  \nThe people are so effortlessly beautiful, how can she fit in. She holds back the\
  \ tears of feeling so whole and shattered all at once. She didn\u2019t fit in with\
  \ the people she came with but longed to connect with those she met. They seemed\
  \ to appreciate her uniqueness while also looking at her like a specimen to be studied.\
  \ In an effort to avoid judgment she melted into the paint, hoping to never be noticed.\
  \ She felt the need to explore and to move, she wandered into the night in search\
  \ of a truth. How do you know when you find it? Aren\u2019t all truths a form of\
  \ a lie? They said it would be easy but it never seemed to be so. \n\nThe moon shone\
  \ on the water and the people faded into the background. A world where old meets\
  \ new and nature meets man made construction. A place of religion and a lack of\
  \ god. Rituals without meaning and life with rare fullness. This city seems to contradict\
  \ itself at every turn, yet it draws her in closer, minute by minute. It sucked\
  \ the blood out of her body while breathing oxygen into her lungs. \n\nAnother day\
  \ passed and she seemed to move without being detected. No one realized that behind\
  \ the smile was a small child longing to belong. She observed those around her in\
  \ an effort to imitate what she thought was normal. They don\u2019t act like the\
  \ people in her life, they are so confident and tranquil, passionate and sometimes\
  \ explosive. \n\nShe contemplated her wants and thoughts of elusiveness. Can she\
  \ allow herself to be true or will that never be enough? Why is it so innate in\
  \ human nature to belong? Because being unique is both terrifying and wonderful.\
  \ Being true to yourself exposes your wounds and your deepest insecurities. She\
  \ sipped her champagne and hoped for some clarity. All that arrived was the dragon\
  \ of doubt, it\u2019s spine made of fear and it\u2019s heart made of isolation.\
  \ Connection to the unknown has never felt more real."
