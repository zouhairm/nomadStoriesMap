Text: "The whole way to Dublin airport I was terrified. What had I done? Work had\
  \ surprised me with two weeks off and I really didn't want to waste them. I wasn't\
  \ in a great head-space after finishing university. No one talks about the months\
  \ of anxiety after leaving the structured safety of education. Who did I want to\
  \ be? What did I want to achieve? What is the point of doing anything? It was my\
  \ first solo trip anywhere, I searched online to find the cheapest flights and accommodation\
  \ and stumbled upon Holidays Hostel Midi in Brussels. Belgium was a country I knew\
  \ very little about (thanks school education) and I seriously regretted not doing\
  \ more research. \nI hugged my parents goodbye and went through the security checks.\
  \ There was no going back and I was a nervous wreck. I arrived at Brussels Airport\
  \ just as the sun was rising and I do have to admit my nerves were subdued for a\
  \ moment by the beauty of the city. This lasted for a total of 0.5 seconds as I\
  \ soon learned all buses and trains were cancelled due to a strike, so my plans\
  \ had to change. I got a taxi outside the terminal. The taxi man had very little\
  \ English and my two years of French lessons really didn't pay off, but he knew\
  \ exactly where the hostel was and he pointed out some restaurants along the way.\
  \ By the time I checked in and found my bed I had realised I had been clenching\
  \ my body since my parents dropped me off. I had worked myself up and been stressing\
  \ out over every single detail. I hadn't been enjoying the process and had already\
  \ forgotten every recommendation the taxi man had suggested. So I set off in hopes\
  \ of changing my attitude.\nI walked and walked and walked and walked. I could not\
  \ find any monuments, or churches or any points of interest. I did see a lot of\
  \ really interesting graffiti but I felt defeated. I was thinking about giving up,\
  \ but then as if almost materialising in front of my very eyes, the most beautiful\
  \ sight. An Irish bar! O'Reilly's Irish pub was my bright star shining the light\
  \ to something familiar. I went in to be welcomed by the dark familiar glow of an\
  \ Irish pub. The smell of old pints and  tables that were always somehow sticky.\
  \ I ordered fish and chips (very adventurous i know) and smothered it is salt and\
  \ vinegar. This got me a few funny looks. The bar man, who I later found out was\
  \ called Lucas, came over and explained that mayonnaise was the topping of choice\
  \ for the locals. I laughed so hard that tears fell from my eyes and before I knew\
  \ it i was completely sobbing to Lucas. I felt completely insane. But he stayed\
  \ and listened to everything I had to say. After I was finished he poured me a pint\
  \ and stayed silent for an uncomfortably long time and said 'You are too focused\
  \ on the end goal that you miss all of the little things'. He was right, as corny\
  \ as it sounds this line has stuck with me since. Before I left he mapped out some\
  \ exciting places to visit. As soon as I stepped out from that beautiful pub everything\
  \ seemed a bit brighter. Maybe it was the pint but I could finally appreciate the\
  \ different architecture, the delicious smell of chocolate and the all-round friendly\
  \ attitude of the locals. I went to Market square which is conveniently located\
  \ beside O' Reilly's (not sure how i missed it). I joined and orange umbrella tour\
  \ group, saw the Manneken Pis and tried some Belgian waffles, no toppings of course\
  \ (the Belgian way) all before 11:30am. \nThis was only the start of my little getaway\
  \ and I didn't realise how much that morning would influence my life."
