Text: "Tucked in an unassuming building, nestled in the lush greenery of Kohala, Hawaii,\
  \ Flumin Kohala offers visitors a chance to see the Big Island in an exclusive and\
  \ adventurous way. Boarding a bus that will take us to our destination, the sugar\
  \ cane irrigation ditches, we quickly find the local guides to be friendly and generous\
  \ with their stories. They are eager young men who reside in Kohala and their eyes\
  \ brighten as they share local myths of Hawaiian kings and history of the area fauna.\
  \  The irrigation ditches, they tell us, were dug by hand, generations ago, before\
  \ Hawaii was a part of United States. Credited to immigrants from Japan, the ditches\
  \ now sit dormant, though water still flows freely through allowing travelers, such\
  \ as ourselves, a unique look into the past while taking in the beautiful Kohala\
  \ landscape. \n\nWe travel through the ditches in kayaks with one of our young guides\
  \ as he gives us a look into their culture, uniquely and entrancingly different\
  \ from cultures on the mainland. We learn of a young babe whisked away from those\
  \ who would do him harm as he was destined to become a king. We listen raptly as\
  \ he tells of boar hunts and feasts with the spoils. We laugh as he pulls Lychee\
  \ from a passing tree and dares us to try the aromatic, musky fruit. Floating over\
  \ waterfalls, through exotic forests and through damp tunnels exhibiting mysterious\
  \ Japanese script written so long ago the characters are faded, we find ourselves\
  \ falling under the spell of the trickling water and storytelling of our Kohala\
  \ guide.  \n\nThough the Hawaiian islands are a part of the United States, we feel\
  \ worlds away floating in the ditches, surrounded by the stories and spirits of\
  \ this rich culture. There is a reverence in the air, as if we have traveled back\
  \ to the times of those fabled kings and feel as if we are traveling through the\
  \ stories themselves. As the journey comes to an end, we fell transcended and are\
  \ in awe of the beauty of Kohala and her people. Island locals have a custom of\
  \ inviting visitors to become their 'Ohana', Hawaiian for family, and to bring the\
  \ spirit of Hawaii with you as travelers return to homes near and far. After our\
  \ experience in Kohala, we all felt the spirit of Hawaii in our hearts and minds\
  \ and will fondly remember our guides as Ohana."
