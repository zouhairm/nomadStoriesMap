Text: "I belong to the millennial generation - the one accused of clicking pictures\
  \ of everything it come across and putting them on social media handles with peculiar\
  \ hashtags. We are also criticized for the haste to reach our destination, not appreciating\
  \ the paths we cross. But the experience I am jotting down today is neither about\
  \ the final destination nor do I possess a picture of the moment. This experience\
  \ is very dear to me also because it\u2019s breaking the stereotypes we millennials\
  \ are associated with.\n\n\nThe experience is of the journey to the destination\
  \ which checked a number of boxes against my bucket list- The first International\
  \ trip; solo indeed, snow-kissed for the first time that made me feel like a bride\
  \ covered in a beautiful gown full of snow from head to toes, making me go head\
  \ over heels and the longest layover ever which I loathed initially but fell in\
  \ love later because I found: My \u2018Insta-bro\u2019 from \u2018Istanbul\u2019\
  \n\n\nTaking you to my memory lane where I boarded the flight from NYC to Mumbai\
  \ via Istanbul. I settled at my window seat and being always curious about other\
  \ cultures, I waited for my fellow traveler. After a couple of minutes, a young\
  \ lady holding her boarding pass in left hand and a brown bag hanging on her right\
  \ arm just an inch before the elbow appeared adorning the kohl of nervousness in\
  \ her eyes. After a few moments of awkward silence, I extended my hand to greet\
  \ her and asked her name. In return, she mumbled \u201CEnglish\u201D with her head\
  \ jostling like a pendulum. Clearly, she didn\u2019t understand English. I was disappointed\
  \ and started toying with the entertainment screen in front of me. When I finally\
  \ found a good movie to watch, the air hostess started giving those \u201Cby rote\u201D\
  \ instructions and our screen started showing the beautiful tourist spots of Istanbul\
  \ since it was the Turkish Airlines\u2019 flight. The same silent lady next to me\
  \ suddenly got excited and pointed towards the screen-trying to tell me that she\
  \ had visited that place. Images shuffled from \u2018The Blue Mosque\u2019 to \u2018\
  Grand Bazar\u2019 and every time, she used to nod her head either in a yes or a\
  \ no to apprise me if she had been there. Oh, it was fun. My movie resumed but it\
  \ interested me no more; I started conversing with the lady. Of course, it was completely\
  \ mime. Both of us didn\u2019t understand each other\u2019s language and the thought\
  \ processes, therefore each idea took a few minutes to be comprehended by the other.\
  \ Sometimes, when it was completely impossible to communicate certain information,\
  \ we did not shy away to skip it. We talked about our family, our favorite color,\
  \ appreciated each other\u2019s dressing sense, food we loved- all without uttering\
  \ even a single word. Everyone around gave us looks as if we were some retards,\
  \ but we didn\u2019t care. The gods of adjectives felt short of words to describe\
  \ our connection.\n\n\nAt that moment I experienced an epiphany, it\u2019s not necessary\
  \ to know a language to know someone, it\u2019s the desire that matters. Sometimes,\
  \ we do not understand the feelings of a person even when he is trying to articulate\
  \ it for us and here we were, separated by languages and cultures yet connected\
  \ by the emotions. And that made the difference. When our flight landed, as a parting\
  \ token we exchanged our earrings \u2013 she liked mine and I loved hers (all explained\
  \ in mime!!). Before parting, she gave me a tight hug and said something which probably\
  \ meant \u2018goodbye\u2019 in her language because that was my instinctive response\
  \ to her.\n\n \nThat\u2019s it. No exchange of contact numbers or names. Maybe next\
  \ time, when I meet her I would not be able to recognize her. If she wears that\
  \ earring, I might or might not. But the journey left a great impact on me. I take\
  \ an extra effort each time I meet someone now, to know what the person is holding\
  \ inside them and how I can make them feel loved the same way that lady made me\
  \ feel."
