Text: "Rome is one trip never to be forgotten.\nThe population of about 821 people,\
  \ the Vatican City an independent state, the temporal seat of the Pope, head of\
  \ the worldwide Catholic Church; entirely surrounded by the city of Rome, in Italy,\
  \ the Vatican is also the world\u2019s smallest state. This picture is the wall\
  \ that surrounds the State separating it from the rest of Rome. These walls are\
  \ so high up and so secure. Females are instructed to cover up their arms and wear\
  \ skirts or pants covering the knees. You simply aren\u2019t allowed in there if\
  \ you don\u2019t abide by these rules. So when a person asks me about a particular\
  \ place that I\u2019ve visited, it is so difficult to not get carried away when\
  \ giving them an answer. By the time I am on the fifth sentence, they\u2019ve probably\
  \ lost focus. It really is overwhelming for both me and the person listening. Truth\
  \ is, you can never sum it up in words because all these places are just phenomenal\
  \ in their own special ways.\nRome is dear to my heart, because of how we were received\
  \ there. Ever heard of Airbnb or Couchsurfing? These are things you need to know\
  \ to make your stay truly special, because you stay with a local who tells you about\
  \ the ins and outs of a city, by the time you have to leave you to feel like a local\
  \ yourself. Six glorious days of good cuisine, delicious wine, the best company,\
  \ the greatest weather and not to mention the best host I have ever come across.\
  \ I still say to this day if we didn\u2019t have a host like Lorenzo, our teddy\
  \ bear- our time wouldn\u2019t have been the same. He opened up his home to us and\
  \ true friendship was formed. We cried on our last day because not to say people\
  \ in Europe aren\u2019t friendly but Lorenzo Gennari\u2019s kindness reminded us\
  \ of Ubuntu that we experience back home in South Africa. What I discovered to be\
  \ interesting were these calendars that were placed in almost every corner. The\
  \ Hot Priests Calendar purely intended to promote the Eternal City and inform visitors\
  \ about the Vatican. These young and handsome priests are real. I saw many of them\
  \ and I'd gladly go back to hug one of them."
