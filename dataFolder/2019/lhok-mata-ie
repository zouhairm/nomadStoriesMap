Text: "Still remember Tsunami 2004? Yeah, Indonesia was one of the victim, and, it\
  \ was Aceh Province that got the hardest hit. Both of my parents were from this\
  \ province, so, even though I wasn't born there, it's my hometown. In 2017, I was\
  \ visiting my grandparents who still lived there to celebrate the Eid Mobarak together.\
  \ It was a tradition in Indonesia to visit the eldest member of family during Eid,\
  \ as the government granted us with a lot of holiday. I was excited to come back\
  \ to my hometown after 4 years of absence and see my cousins.\n\nHowever, I was\
  \ bored there, because, everything was almost closed as around 90% of the province's\
  \ habitants are moslem. Moreover, the beach that we used to visit were closed. I\
  \ got really upset with that fact, I mean, come on... I live in a big city, Jakarta\
  \ and wanted to see my favorite place : beach! I got to stay for a week and had\
  \ nothing to do but eat (because Aceh' dishes are one of the best) at my grandparents'\
  \ house. Then, I started to googling which place nearest to our city that I and\
  \ my cousins can visit. It turned out that, there was a beach called Lhok Mata Ie...and\
  \ this is where the fun begin!\n\nWasting time is not good right? So, we borrowed\
  \ our uncle's car and visited that place. Lhok Mata Ie, in Aceh, literally means:\
  \ \"source of water spring\", situated around 17 KM from my grandparents' house,\
  \ and it is indeed a hidden gem in Aceh. If you've watched The Beach, it looks more\
  \ beautiful than that but smaller in size. It took around 2 hours to reach the site\
  \ since you have to park your car in a village (to park the car usually it's free,\
  \ but you had to ask permission from the villagers) and yes, you have to hike a\
  \ HILL FOREST! \n\nWe were hiking for 45 minutes, and on that day, we were the only\
  \ group there. The hill forest were still natural, we were following the ladder\
  \ steps (created by locals) there to reach the beach. After a long tiring hiking\
  \ finally, It was paid off! The sky was clear so was the water, the beach surrounded\
  \ by forest and rocks it was so calm and felt like a private beach! From the rock\
  \ we jumped into the water and it felt tremendously fun! A calm wave, clean water,\
  \ soft sands, no pollution, a bit of coral there (it won't hurt) with little fishes\
  \ surrounded us and if you see straight toward the ocean, it's Andaman Sea, a part\
  \ of Indian Ocean. So, we were on the edge of Sumatra Island.\n\nWell, a group of\
  \ monkey was joining us, they were uninvited. Sometimes we needed to look at our\
  \ bags, since monkeys were interested what's inside the bags. After 2,5 hours of\
  \ swimming, we finally went back home, and yes of course we needed to climb back\
  \ the hill. Going back home was not as happy as reaching the place, but at least\
  \ we were bringing a good experience, right? So, yeah, we went back to the car and\
  \ directly towards home. I still can't believe that after 13 years the tsunami struck\
  \ down the province, God still left us some places to visit. It's like Guillaume\
  \ Appolinaire said on his poet, Le Pont Mirabeau : \" La joie venait toujours apr\xE8\
  s la peine\"."
