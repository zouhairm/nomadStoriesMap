Text: "My last flight was from Bogot\xE1 to Buenos Aires, and I was certain I was\
  \ going to miss it.  Thirty minutes until departure, and I was only halfway through\
  \ immigration.  I tried convincing people to let me pass, but my Spanish was more\
  \ menos than m\xE1s, and that did not go over so well.  I scanned for screens with\
  \ flight information, but found none.  I scanned for an airport staff member \u2013\
  \ also zero.  Short of pushing strangers, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nTwenty-five\
  \ minutes later, running full-throttle towards my gate, I rounded the corner to\
  \ discover: the flight was delayed.\n\nI swallowed the shaky energy.  I breathed.\
  \  And then I eventually stepped onto the plane, officially inserting myself in\
  \ the next chapter.\n\nI came to Buenos Aires \u201Cto teach English.\u201D  Teaching\
  \ English as a second language had been my job in Boston for the previous three\
  \ years.  I worked at an organization called The Immigrant Learning Center, where\
  \ I taught melting-pot classrooms which made me a witness to the fact that communication\
  \ and connection can happen between anyone, anywhere.  It was an incredible experience.\n\
  \nBut I\u2019ve always felt an undercurrent.  It pulls at my ankles, luring me to\
  \ live in unfamiliar places.  I believe many people feel that, but it\u2019s easy\
  \ to convince yourself you don\u2019t have time.  It might get you off track.  Scared\
  \ of future regret, I gave my notice, bought a series of one-way plane tickets,\
  \ and meandered my way down to Argentina.\n\nI came to Buenos Aires \u201Cto teach\
  \ English.\u201D  But in reality, the main objective was to learn.  I came here\
  \ to absorb a new culture, a new way of life, a new language.  I came here to see\
  \ what I was capable of.\n\n\u201CDo you have a job lined up?\u201D people would\
  \ ask.\n\n\u201CNo.\u201D\n\n\u201CDo you know anyone down there?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Kind of.  One acquaintance\u2026\u201D\n\n\u201CDo you speak Spanish?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Un poquito.\u201D\n\nIt can be scary to not know exactly what you\u2019re doing.\
  \  But sometimes throwing yourself into a space of uncertainty is exactly what you\
  \ need to refresh your life.  And you\u2019d be surprised at how suited you are\
  \ to adapt.\n\nMy high school \u201C\xBFDe d\xF3nde eres?\u201D transformed into\
  \ \u201C\xBFDe d\xF3nde sos?\u201D  T\xFA became vos, quieres became quer\xE9s,\
  \ and the infamous ll sound (typically pronounced as a \u201Cy\u201D in English,)\
  \ mutated into a librarian-like \u201Cshhh.\u201D  The first week I often looked\
  \ at my acquaintance in confusion and frustration, to which he would respond with\
  \ a shrug, \u201CWe say things differently here.\u201D\n\nThe foreign sounds bounced\
  \ around in my ears, and I scribbled notes on my mental observations list.  For\
  \ example, everyone kisses everyone on the cheek.  Dinner starts after 9:00 pm.\
  \  In the evening the parks are packed with people drinking mate \u2013 a hollow\
  \ gourd filled with bitter, green herbs.  There\u2019s a 50% chance there will be\
  \ a strike tomorrow.\n\nThrough trial and error and extended helping hands, I carved\
  \ an interim space for myself in this new world.\n\nMy days are now filled with\
  \ subway rides and long conversations.  I flit from place to place, student to student,\
  \ backpack strapped around my shoulders as if I were in college again.  I teach\
  \ a variety of humanity: a doctor, an Uber driver, a retired lawyer, a dance partner\
  \ I had in tango class, a four-year old boy named Manu.  We discuss politics.  We\
  \ practice verb tenses.  We sing the alphabet.\n\nFreelance teaching is a patchwork\
  \ quilt.  You piece it together as you go along.  I think life in general is like\
  \ that \u2013 piecing it together, the pattern unfolding and sometimes creating\
  \ a shape you hadn\u2019t previously imagined.  I\u2019ve found the most useful\
  \ tool is a simple one, and it is talking to people.  Every time I introduce myself\
  \ it\u2019s an opportunity; now more than ever, I greet the world around me.\n\n\
  \u201CBuen d\xEDa,\u201D sings the old man washing the cracked sidewalk.\n\n\u201C\
  Buen d\xEDa,\u201D I respond, smiling.  The air is already heavy and humid, but\
  \ it doesn\u2019t sit still; everything churns in this city of constant movement.\
  \  I swipe my plastic subway card on the turnstile and trot down the stairs to the\
  \ trains whooshing below.\n\nI am not off track."
