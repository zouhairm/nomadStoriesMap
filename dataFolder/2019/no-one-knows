Text: "He was walking in wonder, half lost, half owning the truth, the absolute truth.\
  \ The question in his mind was, How did I end up here? No one knows. Taking a decision\
  \ is part of the journey, knowing where to go, how will you go there? Where will\
  \ you stay? But to travel without taking that decision? Something felt wrong.The\
  \ only question on his mind was how did I end up here. There were so many voices\
  \ around, none of which he could recognize. When I saw him, the first question he\
  \ asked me was: do you call it a journey even if you didn\u2019t decide to take\
  \ it? I remember myself trying to articulate a response but my mouth betrayed me,\
  \ I still wonder if it hadn\u2019t, what would I have said? To be honest, I was\
  \ glad that my words failed me, perhaps, it would have been unwise. He said after\
  \ moments of silence, the night here is not intimate like the night of Damascus,\
  \ nor as noisy as a night in Cairo. Whether in the south of Holland or the north,\
  \ it did not matter at that time, but in the lowlands, the half lost, half not young\
  \ man washed his face early in the afternoon and invited me for cup of coffee once\
  \ he saw me staring at him. There we realized that we have the same face, the same\
  \ height--176cm, the same clothes and the same smile. I enjoyed watching him, as\
  \ I saw shreds of myself in him, dealing with the new place more than relishing\
  \ in the moment myself. Not solely on account of the quality of weed that the Netherlands\
  \ so generously has on offer. But because I was trying to understand what distinguishes\
  \ the tourist from the migrant, and the refugee from the adventurer. I needed to\
  \ reconcile with this internal issue before freely discovering the city, the city\
  \ with which I had fallen in love, Utrecht , Utie, as I like to call \u201Cher\u201C\
  . \n\nUtie didn\u2019t like me that much at the beginning, but it was reciprocal.\
  \ Each wound \u201Cshe\u201C gave me was tended to by \u201Cher\u201D the next day,\
  \ not only wounds I got learning how to cycle, all types of wounds, the ones in\
  \ the soul and in the memory as well. It should be noted that the number of bikes\
  \ in Holland is twice the number of inhabitants, and Utrecht has the longest cycling\
  \ path in whole Europe, anyway, I was trying to know what can a stranger do in a\
  \ city, apparently nothing but being more strange, after a while the stranger fosters\
  \ a connection with a specific place, it becomes known to him/her, a place that\
  \ he/she can escape if the memories attack them, and a place that starts creating\
  \ new memories, that place was a specific bit on the canal, the Oudegracht, The\
  \ old canal and especially in the winter, when no one is there, a weird fact about\
  \ the canals here, that they are full of bikes dumped into it. So each month the\
  \ municipality take a lot of bikes out of the canal, I still need to look into that.\n\
  This old city made everything clear, everything, only one question was not answered\
  \ in my mind and my old friend's mind, how did I end up here? No one knows.\n\n\
  \ I also discovered my old city through Utrecht, and I believe now that you know\
  \ a specific city through another, there is no other way to know a city. And you\
  \ have to be  aware that cities are like people, complicated, attention hungry,\
  \ and they feel jealous, so be careful."
