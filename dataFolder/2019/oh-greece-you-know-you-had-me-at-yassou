Text: "Facebook post. Dated 26 August 2018:\n\nPete, this place is Damianakis country,\
  \ you\u2019ve got to come over, the people, the girls. They\u2019re begging for\
  \ a man of your ilk.\n\n\nIn my mind I was there. 4 weeks later I boarded a scoot.com\
  \ budget flight to Athens, Greece. The jet darted via a Singapore stopover.\n\n\
  I got crabs! Chilli mud crabs. What a wonderful entr\xE9e to what would be a smorgasbord\
  \ when I reached Greece. A 12,000km journey over land and sea to a destiny. The\
  \ destiny and fate that is Greece. My Greece.\n\nI think for the rest of my life\
  \ navigating this journey, excavating knowledge and the awakening will always remain\
  \ a profound, moving experience. \n\nI stood at the steps of the Parthenon and I\
  \ recall reading a stanza from Lord Byron\u2019s Don Juan. The short, 4 lines captured\
  \ a flood of emotion. A snap shot of sensory delight and sadness.\n\n\u2018The mountains\
  \ look on Marathon,\nAnd Marathon looks on the sea,\nAnd musing there an hour alone,\n\
  I dreamed that Greece may still be free\u2019\n\nForever she will be my muse, mistress,\
  \ teacher and I will be her slave. Appropriately, being an Australian of Greek decent,\
  \ I entered what must be the equivalent to a Mediterranean dreamtime that I gladly\
  \ will never be able to escape.\n\nThere was a time I despised her. Greece had meant\
  \ so much to the world. How? How could she dare contract to a tiny little speck\
  \ of sand on this orb we call Earth? It was the ancient civilisation that gave birth\
  \ to order, nurtured liberty and all but died with chaos.\n\nI do remember standing\
  \ at the Acropolis, autumnal leaves offered a patina of light and shade and whilst\
  \ looking down on a sad, decaying Athens  that looked like a collection of boxes\
  \ that offered a skyline that assumed the appearance of a rubble of fallen dominoes.\
  \ I recalled thinking, how could these people, my people, innovators run out of\
  \ innovation and thoughts. It was tragic. She was tired and I did learn sadness\
  \ that I had never felt before. It was akin to despair. \n\nWhen in Sydney my path\
  \ will cross many people who run the gamut of emotion, from A to B. There is sarcasm\
  \ intended. Everybody should visit this place called \u2018Greece\u2019. Hell, it\u2019\
  s not a place, it\u2019s a compendium of every emotion one could ever possibly experience.\
  \ The past, her tradition and heritage that bows to the seismic forces of history\
  \ and humanities visceral urges. You can\u2019t see Greece, you must only ever feel\
  \ Greece. Orpa!\n\nWalk away for a bit and I promise you will carry the delightful\
  \ burden of every sense that is driven to euphoria. \n\nEscape the cotton wool world\
  \ of Sydney and feel the other lady in the room who goes by the name, Hellas. \n\
  \nI  allowed myself to be seduced by the solitude of Mount Athos, majestic and the\
  \ grand beauty of Santorini, felt the heat of the fire walkers of Lagadia and Danced\
  \ original trance at the Carnival Patras. Fear, joy, sadness, love, hate, bliss\
  \ \u2013 it\u2019s all here and more. She didn\u2019t go away after all. She is\
  \ there in the shadows, the smells, sounds and lusty humour of the Greeks. She captured\
  \ my heart and every day spent with her will inevitably steal my breath too like\
  \ no other has or ever will.\n\nHarika poli my family said. Sharing stories that\
  \ have travelled centuries to come to me. Generations of ancestors. Pirates, hermits,\
  \ ghosts and heroes. This is just the tip of the Acropolis. \n\nSix weeks is not\
  \ enough for the amount of times I stood stock still, rooted to the spot. Those\
  \ well-worn clich\xE9s are true. Frozen, petrified with delight and suspended in\
  \ time and space. I gaze at you, enraptured, consumed as I round a clump of olive\
  \ trees to spy an ancient amphitheatre to hear the reverent fervour of patrons from\
  \ eons ago who enjoy the birth of western world, nurtured by Sophocles, Euripides,\
  \ Plato, Aristotle, Socrates and Pericles. \n\nAnd gradually, seductively the magic\
  \ of Greece settled upon me, gently clinging as golden pollen.\n\nOh Greece, you\
  \ had me at Yassou."
