Text: "It was in taking the bus daily in Charlotte, North Carolina that I learnt the\
  \ most about America. In the UK, public transport is a matter of convenience, it\
  \ is not unusual to encounter a variety of social classes, races, and ages. In Charlotte,\
  \ however, I found that those living in poverty (predominantly ethnic minorities)\
  \ used public transport the most. On a normal day, it would take me around 40 minutes\
  \ to get to and from work. This allowed me to recognise familiar faces and learn\
  \ that the bus was more of a community than a mode of transport. Despite my differences\
  \ in being foreign, the colour of my skin allowed me to blend in and outwardly identify\
  \ with individuals around me. However, it was my age that often caught me in the\
  \ middle of two groups of people.\n\nThe youth were a product of their environment.\
  \ One evening I sat across from two young boys. Their blue shirts looked worn and\
  \ their shoes had holes. Brothers? Maybe. Friends? Most likely. One slept whilst\
  \ the other looked out for their stop despite his own fatigue. It was unexpected\
  \ to see young bodies so tired and weary. It was tough to watch children, often\
  \ described as the hope of tomorrow, look as though they had everything but hope\
  \ for tomorrow. When it was time they got off the bus and began their long walk\
  \ home in the dark. I watched them from my window as long as the road would allow\
  \ and began to wonder their ages and whether they had dreams or aspirations. Conversations\
  \ on the bus helped me learn just how disadvantaged children growing up in the projects\
  \ (government housing for those with little income) were and how many children could\
  \ not see a world beyond their street corner.\n\nOn the other hand, the old were\
  \ a product of their experiences. Though these experiences may have not been entirely\
  \ pleasurable, from their speech it was clear that the majority had a deep appreciation\
  \ for life. Each day I would stand by an old man with a blue denim jacket, waiting\
  \ for the bus 7N. He did not speak much because he had no need to. The smile on\
  \ his face spoke many words. There was something comforting about his friendly greeting\
  \ and I would listen in as he encouraged people he knew. When it was time, he would\
  \ get off at his stop and day after day, no matter the weather, he would walk away\
  \ with a smile. After many journeys, I no longer became a spectator but a recipient\
  \ of his inspiration. He told me stories of his younger days, things he wished he\
  \ could have done and many pictures of his grandchildren. A bus journey with him\
  \ on board instilled confidence within all who he encountered, to be able to take\
  \ on whatever was to come their way.\n\nI found myself caught in the middle. I felt\
  \ that I had something to offer the younger generation sitting behind me on the\
  \ back of the bus. Despite this, I craved comfort from older individuals sitting\
  \ close to the front due to the bus drivers did not give more than a few seconds\
  \ for people to get to a seat. After some time I then learnt that it was a great\
  \ thing. My British accent made younger individuals fall in awe of everything I\
  \ said, they made me tell countless stories of what England was like, asking if\
  \ I knew the Queen and making me repeat words they thought I said funny over and\
  \ over again. On the other hand, there were also times where I could be a student,\
  \ hearing the trials and triumphs of those that had gone before. Each day as I\u2019\
  d get off the bus, I would be excited about what the next day would hold, the age\
  \ of the passengers and which role I would fit into. Another day, another $2.20."
