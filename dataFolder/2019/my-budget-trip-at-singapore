Text: "First of all the story started here on a dark night where I was getting ready\
  \ for my first ever international trip. Well it was Singapore. Flight was at 5.00am\
  \ in the morning and reached airport by 3.00am. Took 4 full hours for me to reach\
  \ Singapore from Chennai. After all it was like a heaven, and blessed to see heaven\
  \ before I die (well that's my mind voice). So wandering and exploring the cleanest\
  \ streets and roads of Singapore and wished India should have one. So after a pleasant\
  \ flight from Singapore airlines, we finally reached our hotel at Little India,\
  \ the reason our tourist agency chose this particular area is because this Is the\
  \ area where all hotels comes in our budget. We all Indians love budget and free\
  \ stuffs, and I am no exceptional. So we were welcomed with complimentary breakfast,\
  \ this is what all Indians ask their first question at front desk. But welcomed\
  \ with all Indian dishes (My inner voice, dude this I could have experienced in\
  \ my country with much good taste, why Singapore). And there comes the most important\
  \ part of a humans life when food goes in, ya you guessed it, it's sleep. I seriously\
  \ don't know how long I slept, but for a good amount. Woke up schedule started and\
  \ this time its own play. Means we get the freedom to roam anywhere without a tourist\
  \ guide. But here comes the most challenging part, the food. Singapore with high\
  \ cost of living, we somehow managed to buy biscuit packets and noodles. It was\
  \ my fate to have noodles there where in that was not even considered by myself\
  \ in India. \nThe travelled a lot in metro stations, because that was 10th year\
  \ of Singapore metro and mono rail. They provided us an offer of just 10SD, to get\
  \ the ticket and roam anywhere unlimited times in metro, sounds great right. We\
  \ also did that intelligent task. Visited Mustafa market that was opposite to our\
  \ hotel. I really wanted to see the gentlemen in my life who told all items in Mustafa\
  \ market are very cheap to the hell. But it was the reverse, not at all, after seeing\
  \ those cost me and my father compared it with the cost at Ritchie street in Chennai,\
  \ the place we get first copy (if you are alert enough else you will bare with 3rd\
  \ or 4th copy). After a great haul, everyone were hungry, luckily that lunch was\
  \ covered within our travel agency expenses. But we still had that fear how to withstand\
  \ the next 2 days. Yes I am exaggerating a bit, it is not that we don't have money,\
  \ but refused to use it. Somehow we tend to manage the expenses within our budget,\
  \ but this is also a type of fun you can experience with. Done with all the purchasing.\
  \ Yes we never tend to bargain for purchase but for food alone. Then covered up\
  \ and reached Chennai with fullest happiness within us. Our faces was like as if\
  \ we fought a war and returned to homeland with victory, but none of that was happened.\
  \ And we continued our lives with a budget friendly ones. \n\nMy mistake was, we\
  \ did not had a track of expenses. And at that time we were not aware of these sites\
  \ useful for travellers like \"Worldnomads\" etc. If I was aware I would have had\
  \ still more fun. But still this was my wonderful and lovely trip with my parents\
  \ ever made."
