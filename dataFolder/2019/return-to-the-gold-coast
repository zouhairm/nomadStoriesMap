Text: "I was born in Lagos, Nigeria a few days before the New Year rang in, in 1985.\
  \ My parents were from Ghana, always wondered how did I end up being born in another\
  \ country that wasn\u2019t my lineage. At two years old I left Africa shortly after\
  \ my parents lost their 1 year old son to an accident under the car of my mothers\
  \ younger sister. David, my younger brother always appeared to me in my dreams.\
  \ I came to Canada as a toddler, after my mother was sponsored by another younger\
  \ sister, Aunty Susie. She was the trailblazer of the family, the bold woman who\
  \ provided everything to Sisters/Brothers (all 12) and their children. She was unable\
  \ to have children of her own so she become the second mother to all of us, her\
  \ neices and nephews. The only connection I had left of my African Culture was limited\
  \ to enforced Pentecostal church services, African films that often scared me to\
  \ death with its cheap cgi and suspense, and my mother who spoke Twi to me but gave\
  \ up when I conformed to the English-Canadian culture. Being so young and having\
  \ the other half of my family on the continent in Nigeria/Ghana. My father and two\
  \ other siblings were only foreign voices on the phone that I hear once in a while.\
  \ My mother was an Iron Lady who worked arduously to raise a rebellious teen daughter,\
  \ and a quiet toddler son whom the schools told he was struggling with learning.\
  \ I was silent and observient but always listened and soaked in every aspect of\
  \ my environment, school was hard and God knows I tried but being the son of a hard\
  \ nose immigrant who refused to allow teachers to tell her her son was slow, and\
  \ child in government housing I became settled. I felt trapped, but also felt like\
  \ I had potential and I didn\u2019t like being limited. So I played sports, predominantly\
  \ soccer and became so good I traveled (playing U-17 in tournaments in the Caribbean\u2019\
  s), Caribbean culture was more of a comfort to me than my own African culture. I\
  \ was raised on Patois in my neighborhood. It wasn\u2019t until I struggled out\
  \ of post-secondary school the first time, and being left jobless in 2009 with a\
  \ degree was deemed useless in the job market  (BA Political Science - Brock University),\
  \ that I chose to find my voice. My voice needed to be journeyed in my culture,\
  \ my culture was African, and I found some way to obtain OSAP grants, when I returned\
  \ to give school a second chance to travel back home, home being Ghana. I\u2019\
  ve read so much about Ghana and the culture, yet I didn\u2019t even speak Twi, I\
  \ had allowed myself to lose my tongue and become Ghanaidian (Ghanaian-Canadian).\
  \ I heard my mother talk to Aunty Susie and she said she was leaving to go to Ghana\
  \ for Easter 2010. This was my opportunity to travel, and I did this journey with\
  \ the woman who gave me everything, but I feared her sharp tongue. Many of my friends\
  \ who did make the trip went with friends during Christmas to have fun. My aunt\
  \ was inviting me to her home. Africa, and Ghana specifically opened my eyes up\
  \ in so many ways. People, Food, Nature and Culture. All that was beautiful was\
  \ Ghana. I had gain a few pounds eating food of often refused, but I fell in love\
  \ with Ghana, and understood why my aunt work so hard, because in her trips to Ghana\
  \ she was no longer a factory worker, but a respected business woman who did a lot\
  \ of her family, friends and community. She made me know that Ghana was the only\
  \ true love. I love being Canadian, but I must be Ghanaian first and I must maintain\
  \ this identity and sense of self. I realized what I was destined to be when I return,\
  \ and it was a good person who wanted to help others, hence today I am social worker\
  \ in the Addictions and Mental Health field. And I vow to bring wellness not just\
  \ to myself but others. Akwaaba!"
