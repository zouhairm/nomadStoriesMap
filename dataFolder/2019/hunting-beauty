Text: "According to Wikipedia a male moose may weight more than 600 kilos and be almost\
  \ three meters tall. No wonder that these huge animals are one of the biggest causes\
  \ of car crash in Finland, where on a drive from south up to Lapland you would see\
  \ just trees, lakes and the triangle-shaped road signs that warn you about moose.\n\
  It\u2019s in fact after a car journey that I first saw one of them, yet not on the\
  \ road.\nTired and hungry, with my jacket zipped up to protect myself from the low\
  \ temperatures, I had just arrived to Perho, a Finnish town in the neck of the woods.\n\
  There, my host was waiting for me and after a brief \u201Chelou\u201D drove me to\
  \ her house.\nI opened the door and the first thing I saw was a huge dining table\
  \ on top of which lied the back part of a moose, which a man with white beard and\
  \ a small kid were butchering. \nIt was October, and while the first snow covered\
  \ the ground, Finns were enjoying the hunting season. It was clear to me, from the\
  \ meat on the table and the horns on the wall, that I had just stepped into a hunter\u2019\
  s house.\nAs soon as he noticed me, the man stood up and shook my hand saying \u201C\
  Tervetuloa, welcome\u201D with his crooked smile.\nI sat with him and it took a\
  \ while for me to stop worrying about spending four days with a family that couldn\u2019\
  t speak English and perfectly matched the Finnish stereotype: very quiet and shy.\
  \ \nAnd about the moose, well\u2026 I tried not to look at it. \nDuring my stay\
  \ in Finland, I understood that its people are just like the country: to the superficial\
  \ traveler they\u2019re meaningless, not being exciting nor extraordinary, yet they\
  \ can give much to those who are not binge-observers.\nAfter that panic moment I\
  \ had sitting at the table, I got rid of my stiffness and decided that I had to\
  \ adapt.\nMy finnish skills enhanced incredibly after those hard four days (thanks\
  \ to google translate too) and so did my respect and consideration of my hosts.\n\
  The dad, a hunter with a missing finger who was always willing to help me, the son,\
  \ mischievous but interested in everything I told him with my strong accent, his\
  \ sister, cold but witty, and the mother.\nBig in size and short-haired, at first\
  \ she looked scary, but turned out to be capable of deep sweetness and would thoroughly\
  \ take care of the confused exchange student I was.\nThey have all given me an important\
  \ insight on their culture and personality, and I am extremely grateful for that.\
  \ \nAs I said, Finns are famous for being quiet and this, to a chatty Italian like\
  \ me was initially annoying and awkward. \nIt is only when I stopped my frenetic\
  \ seek for wild adventure that I understood that people around me were silent universes\
  \ I could get very much from.\nThis mindset also applies to Finnish landscape.\n\
  While many associate Finland to northern lights and snowy mountains, the truth is\
  \ that the country is more like a patchwork of fields, trees and lakes, sometimes\
  \ interrupted by small towns.\n\u201DFinland is not sexy\u201D locals used to tell\
  \ me, in fact its black and white winter palette is probably less attractive than\
  \ the exotic destinations Europeans often aim to, but I think there\u2019s more\
  \ below the surface.\nAs I learned to love my Perho family and their not so special\
  \ routine, I also understood the country\u2019s beauty.\nI started seeing the wonder\
  \ in the apparently dull snowy landscapes I saw.\nTogether with my host family I\
  \ went hiking and ate makkara (the traditional sausage), and my last day in Perho\
  \ was a lucky one for Iiro, the dad, who shot a moose.\nHe brought its head home,\
  \ and Timo, his son, was excited to show me how heavy it was and laughed when I\
  \ tried to lift it.\nThe following morning, after those four fulfilling days, I\
  \ was caught by contrasting feelings.\nWhile sad because it had passed so fast,\
  \ I felt extremely happy, blessed and proud for what it had been."
