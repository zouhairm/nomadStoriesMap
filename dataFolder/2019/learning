Text: "Why did I choose \u201CCambodia\u201D?\n\nCambodia gave me a lot of chances.\n\
  I just chose Cambodia for volunteering at home of orphans through a program for\
  \ a week. Unfortunately, the program offered me to volunteer only 1 day though \U0001F602\
  \ \nHowever, I could spend quality time.\n\nI\u2019m a Japanese, so I had a sense\
  \ of superiority to Cambodia. But it\u2019s wrong.\nI thought Cambodia is stronger\
  \ than Japan when I learned about history of Cambodia.\nCambodia has horrible histories,\
  \ but the histories are important for the locals, so the locals study languages\
  \ and tell us the stories with our language. What a powerful people!\U0001F633\n\
  In rural area, there are a lot of smiling faces of children even though they cannot\
  \ go to school. Instead of education, they\u2019re really working hard for their\
  \ families and their lives. I heard that money which was earned by children sometimes\
  \ use for their parents\u2019 cigarettes... it\u2019s really wired, right? Their\
  \ parents should regret!\U0001F621 Anyway, I thought it\u2019s really poor problem\
  \ not to get a chance to study, but unfortunately, I don\u2019t have a right to\
  \ get a education for them... and of course, you also don\u2019t have rights. How\
  \ frustrating!\U0001F615\nAll told, I realized that I love learning directly.\n\n\
  That\u2019s why I chose Cambodia.\nIt\u2019s for the first time to share my opinions\
  \ with my friends about social problems and so on...\nI\u2019m really thankful to\
  \ Cambodia for giving a chance to realize that.\n \n\nI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s not\
  \ like a story but I cannot explain systematically..."
