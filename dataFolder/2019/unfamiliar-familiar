Text: "Up until I entered college, my whole life was surrounded by the soaring skyscrapers\
  \ and blurs of city traffic. City life was all I knew, and I never left it. Suddenly,\
  \ I was alone on a one-way flight to Germany to a city I\u2019ve never heard of\
  \ and a language I could not speak a single word. I didn\u2019t care, the adrenaline\
  \ and the unknown for what Germany had intrigued me. I wanted to be surprised and\
  \ I knew I was going to be. Ten hours later, instead of skyscrapers, it was red-roofed\
  \ houses and instead of city traffic, it was empty cobble stone streets. From the\
  \ moment I landed, I knew I could experience things I never thought I could. \n\n\
  One of the most defining experiences I had in Germany was when I solo traveled to\
  \ two neighboring cities. This experience was different altogether than any trip\
  \ I had ever taken. Going solo was a scary thought because I would be all on my\
  \ own in the unfamiliar. I would have no one to share these experiences with in\
  \ the moment, but it also meant I would have something meaningful for myself. I\
  \ was interested in finding out what that meant and so, I took the leap to step\
  \ outside my comfort zone. What came out of this solo experience were small lessons\
  \ I learned about myself and the global community is. I learned that I could trust\
  \ myself and my instincts in the unfamiliar. I followed my instincts instead of\
  \ the voices in my head. I met strangers who also solo traveled to explore the unknown.\
  \ I learned about their different backgrounds and their stories and was surprised\
  \ to learn the unexpected about other cultures. For example, I met a solo traveler\
  \ from Paris who was video-calling his family because he was the only one possible\
  \ to travel. This was an eye opener for me because I realized that not everyone\
  \ who solo travels travels for the same reason as I do. Sometimes, they solo travel\
  \ because they want their close family to experience bigger and better things in\
  \ life. In addition, even though I was traveling alone, I was able to share some\
  \ of these experiences with the strangers I met.\n\nSolo traveling was one of the\
  \ last things I did before I returned home to the soaring skyscrapers and city traffic.\
  \ And I\u2019m glad I did. I returned home with a stronger sense of self confidence,\
  \ thinking that if I was able to solo travel, then I could do anything. In a way,\
  \ I overcame my fear of the unfamiliar, and made one thing unfamiliar, familiar.\
  \ I returned home three weeks after this solo trip with a stronger sense of self-trust\
  \ and ready to take on the unknown."
