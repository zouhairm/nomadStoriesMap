Text: "So what do I do in my free time at work???? I google stuff like \" world's\
  \ longest train ride, world's longest bus ride, how to take a ferry and travel from\
  \ Europe to India, overland travel in Africa etc etc. I personally feel flights\
  \ are the most mundane way to travel and I find them devoid of any emotion. But\
  \ with an Indian passport doing overland to different countries  through public\
  \ transport system is almost impossible and also risky for a solo woman traveler.\
  \ Also with our not so strong passport ,countries are more than willing to let us\
  \ do overland if we are coming back to India. Basically we are poor Indians so when\
  \ we show them that we are coming back they are more then happy!!!!!! (who wants\
  \ poor people anywayssss ) . \n\nI had heard about the World\"s Highest Train that\
  \ travels from Guangzhou in South China to Lhasa in Tibet. A journey of 4890 km\
  \ covered in roughly 56 hours....Its called the Sky Train. I also read about the\
  \ Friendship Highway between China and Nepal . So this is how my route was decided;\
  \ China -Tibet-Nepal- India . I would need a China Visa, Tibet permit  and Nepalese\
  \ Visa on Arrival. \n\nAnd then it took me month to get visa, train tickets, overland\
  \ Tibet booking , permits etc etc..and there I was at Mumbai airport with butterflies\
  \ in my stomach. Im at the checkin counter ;\n Guy- \"Mam can i see your return\
  \ ticket \"?\nMe- I dont have a return , im doing an overland trip so will be going\
  \ to Nepal from China \nMam- Can i see your China - Nepal  ticket ?\nMe - Im doing\
  \ an overland so dont have ticket.\nThe guy goes out to call someone .......(rest\
  \ of the story later) \nMy panic button just got pressed and I experienced the same\
  \ once again when i wasn't allowed to board the train from Guangzhou (mind you i\
  \ dont understand Chinese and they dont bother to talk in anything except Chinese)\
  \ . So yes I realized  one can never be fully prepared with overland .\n\nThe 18days\
  \ of this journey was nothing and everything that I had expected. \nFew takeaways\
  \ :\n1. Its nice to be the only different looking person. I was like a thing to\
  \ be seen and people came from far end coaches to see me and chat.\n2. You get the\
  \ window seat in variably...Chinese people are rather hospitable..\n3. Google translator\
  \ does not work so well with our Indian  english accent . I learnt to use Hindi\
  \ to Chinese translator. Language is not a barrier.\n4. I thought I was tolerant\
  \ with food.....Tibet proved me wrong and after a point I was smelling Chinese.\n\
  5.  Chinese people love Indian Chicken Curry ...(its just that it took me 2 hrs\
  \ to buy the ingredients with my airbnb friend( only Chinese speaking)\n6. Chinese\
  \ movies can be enjoyed without English subtitles also Shahrukh Khan is indeed a\
  \ global star.\n7. I can stay without talking  (56 hours all I did was I smiled\
  \ and spoke \"hoon\"\" and maybe nodded)\n8. Chinese girls have the same pressure\
  \ like us \". Why wasnt I married ???  Chinese aunties were like Gujju aunties in\
  \ train, who talk loud and kill you with food offerings.\n9. Everest is Everest\
  \ (you just need to feel it)\n10. The road from China- Tibet border to Nepal is\
  \ the cheapest and the most thrilling adventure package in the world (50 USD)...Just\
  \ dont buy it!!!!!! (its took 14 hours to cover a distance of 112 kms)\n11. Its\
  \ not just we Indians who are sex starved , all nationalities go through period\
  \ of famine ( 11 of us from all over the world conversations)\n12. There is something\
  \ called reverse altitude sickness where oxygen cylinders dont help .\n13. Nepal\
  \ has resilience, its rather a strong country. And yes the fact that im a Hindu\
  \ just got reinforced at Pashupatinath.\n14. Adversity brings you together. We are\
  \ rather more similar..... then being different.\n15....AND MANY MORE.....\n\nI\
  \ had a smile all through while writing this. I hope you find joy in it too."
