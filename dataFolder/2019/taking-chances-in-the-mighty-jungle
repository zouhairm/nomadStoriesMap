Text: "Upon parting ways from a very good friend and my intended plans in Thailand,\
  \ I found myself heading from Pai to Chiang Rai with some new backpacker friends\
  \ in an extended cargo van. We questioned ourselves in regards to our only choice\
  \ of transport, when our tremoring elderly driver limped towards the van and asked\
  \ for our tickets. With it being the last journey of the day, we had no choice but\
  \ to load our backpacks into the van and climb in. At some point along the journey,\
  \ I awoke in a groggy medicated state of misery from the food poisoning I attained\
  \ two days prior, to the stinging pain of a fresh tattoo rubbing against the armrest.\
  \ As I sat slouched against the window of the van, I realized the van was fish-tailing\
  \ off the edge of a cliff. Struggling to stay conscious for just a few moments longer,\
  \ I found myself not having the energy to care about reality and nodded off to sleep.\
  \ \n\nAwakening alive and without battle wounds in Chiang Rai was a surprise to\
  \ both my friends and I.  We thanked the driver and begun walking around in search\
  \ of a hostel where we could store our belongings. It wasn\u2019t long upon exploring\
  \ before I was signing up for a two-day trek through the jungles of Northern Thailand.\
  \ I briefly questioned my general ability given my current state, but like all good\
  \ explorers and masochists, I banished my doubts to the depths of my soul where\
  \ they belonged in that moment. \n\nThe next morning, we were driven out to our\
  \ starting point, with many unknown stops along the way. It was at the starting\
  \ point that we met our guide whose name was phonetically spelled, Jahboo. We began\
  \ our journey in a tiny village while the local children ran around laughing, playing\
  \ and showing off.  As we commenced our 12-kilometer, predominately uphill journey,\
  \ I became filled with insecurity. Could I really make it through this trek with\
  \ food poisoning? Should I have really split ways with my long-term friend and traveled\
  \ with people I didn\u2019t know? Was it too late to turn back? I conquered those\
  \ doubts quickly, as the answer was simply, yes. Throughout the entire journey,\
  \ beads of sweat continuously rolled down the curve of my spine only to pool at\
  \ the small of my back and be absorbed by my thermal shirt. Being distracted from\
  \ my despair wasn\u2019t difficult due to the discovery of a plethora of stunning\
  \ views and fascinating creatures along the way, including boastfully colored butterflies,\
  \ Rhinoceros Beetles and elephants. We finally settled in for the day at Jahboo\u2019\
  s home, where we ate marvelous food, played with his children and prepared for bed.\
  \ The lack of electricity in the village left the three of us girls to talk ourselves\
  \ into a slumber. Day one was complete with no bathroom disaster occurrences. The\
  \ real question was; could I make it through day number two? \n\nThe second day,\
  \ we grumpily awoke to the crowing of roosters at four o'clock in the morning, which\
  \ shortly followed by the sounds of people conversing in the village. We had no\
  \ choice but to wake up and get ready for the 12-kilometer trek ahead of us. All\
  \ was going well just prior to arriving at our lunchtime destination, when my body\
  \ told me something was wrong. There was hope as the fortunate timing secured the\
  \ proximity and privacy of a bathroom. I began slowly walking away from the lunch-hut\
  \ towards the outhouse, clenching every muscle in my body and making deals with\
  \ God, during the longest 200-meter walk of my life. The toilet was to be flushed\
  \ with water from the nearby creek, but that didn\u2019t take away from its beauty.\
  \ To this very day, that toilet remains my favorite toilet on the planet. We finished\
  \ the trek several hours later and returned to Chiang Rai. Looking back years later,\
  \ that trip and those experiences were a huge blessing, as I still keep in touch\
  \ with those two friends, embrace the lessons learned on that trip, and have the\
  \ utmost faith in myself to accomplish anything despite of how I may feel."
