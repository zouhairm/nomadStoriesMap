Text: "\u201CI am proud to be a lazy being. I just love my alone time with my couch,\
  \ and a bit of idiot box, so what, if I am on vacation. I am blessed! Thank You,\
  \ Lord. \"\n\n\u201CGet up! We have a plan.\u201D Her croaky voice broke my reverie.\
  \ \u201CWe are traveling to Philadelphia today. I thought of meeting a friend there,\
  \ and sideways we can also explore the city, and you're joining the gang, \u201C\
  she said with a sharp smile. \u201CBut, I want to take a nap on my dear couch. Count\
  \ me out please,\u201D I requested.  \u201CIt\u2019s cold today here in New Jersey,\
  \ so wear something warm. We will leave at 4 PM,\u201D she said, completely ignoring\
  \ my pleading look.\n\n\u201CI hate her! But, she's a dear friend\u201D I tried\
  \ to convince myself. My left-side brain continuously influenced the right-side,\
  \ still in a torpid state, to get ready for the visit. I think I was losing the\
  \ battle! But, the fact remains, today, when I remember that cold January evening,\
  \ I feel I made the right choice of listening to my friend and visiting Philadelphia.\
  \ I have a memory cherished forever. \n\nI styled myself in blue denim with my black\
  \ puffer jacket, and thigh high boots. Leena was driving, and my job was to guide\
  \ her with the route. So, I logged into Google maps, and set the destination to\
  \ \u201CThe Philadelphia Museum of Art\u201D. It would have taken us 1 hour 25 minutes\
  \ (65 miles) to reach our destination. \n\nWe were on time with no major traffic\
  \ halts on I-195 route, but I was hacked off with Leena\u2019s playlist. \"How a\
  \ single track occupy one's entire playlist, I wonder?\" \n\nThree of us assembled\
  \ in front of the museum entrance in that dusky evening, and to my surprise, we\
  \ were not the only 3 who landed there! There were tons of visitors around us, but\
  \ a single melody running through space, \"Gonna fly now. Flying high now.\u201D\
  \n\nI want to confess, that I am not a Sylvester Stallone admirer, yet I have seen\
  \ his work in the Rocky series, and I must say, that he has done a great job. But,\
  \ it was just a famous song! And, some random steps to be climbed, well-known as\
  \ Rocky steps though.\n\nBut, I was star-struck! I was amazed by the positive atmosphere\
  \ around me.\n\n\u201CCan you turn up the volume?\u201C I heard a mature voice behind\
  \ me breaking my magical illusion. \u201CIt\u2019s dead!\u201D\n\nI felt compelled\
  \ to turn back towards an aged man with a walking stick, and looking at me in mute\
  \ hopeless appeal. \u201CMy battery died\u201D he whispered smiling while flaunting\
  \ his iPhone XS. I smiled back, and grabbed Leena\u2019s phone to increase the music\
  \ volume to a decibel range, within an acceptable noise level! The lyrics lifted\
  \ his spirit; as I could sense a never give up attitude on his face. I was mesmerized\
  \ to see him climbing the steps, one after the other, slowly, while humming the\
  \ theme.\n\nI was shaken, could feel the craziness, the excitement, and the madness.\
  \ It was all over the place. I was surrounded with people from different genres\
  \ of life, different colors, with their own set of struggles, escapes, and now standing\
  \ here as champions in their own sense. There was no time to freeze. I wanted to\
  \ feel the fire and climb up the iconic stone steps.\n\nI started my run up the\
  \ rocky steps imitating the famous scene from the movie starting zero..one..two..10..20..30..40..50..60..70..71\
  \ and finally reaching the top. With my breath up and down, sweat all over, my arms\
  \ raised in victory, I conquered the world in my way! The climb transformed me in\
  \ a way, I could never expect."
