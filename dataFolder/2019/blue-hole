Text: As soon as I touched the feet of the blue water during my preparation for diving
  in the Blue Hole, I looked down, saw 150 ducks under my feet, caught my breath and
  felt a hand pulling me to the beach .. A spot in the city of magic (Dahab) in Egypt
  , combines the fun of life and death in a strange contradiction, Despite the sinking
  of more than 150 divers, the magic still attracts divers from all over the world
  like the pharaohs of ancient Pharaonic mythology. No one can explain the mystery
  of this strange magic. The sound of a crash on my side makes me aware of my chordi
  and a number of tourists who have turned around to help me and their gaze focused
  on my face, I did not know whether I should tell them that I saw dead under my feet
  It must be kept silent so as not to panic Osibam !! But I was struck by a strange
  power that drove me back to the blue waters again. I stood there meditating and
  contemplating the mandarin, the clown and the rainbow, and I felt nothing but magic
  that made me jump between the ghosts of the blue divers and the Blue Hole and surrendered
  to this magic without asking who killed all of them Love or magic ! .
