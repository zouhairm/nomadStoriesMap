Text: "I remembered the day when i booked my train tickets to udaipur a day before\
  \ the journey date. This normally doesn't happen to me because in the past i have\
  \ made so many plans and didn't execute a single one of them. \n\nI live in jaipur\
  \ so there is a direct train to udaipur and it takes 7 hours to reach. So i had\
  \ planned according to train time but it took me 11 hours to reach to udaipur. It\
  \ was 1 AM when i reached udaipur. \nIn the train i met a great family. They were\
  \ kind, they gave me food and a place to sit. We got to know each other well. There\
  \ was a baby with them so adorable. The 11 hours journey didn't feel long. The atmosphere\
  \ of the compartment was amazing and familier. And i knew that visiting udaipur\
  \ is gonna be the life changing for me.\nUdaipur( the city of lakes), when i reached\
  \ there, the cold breeze was confronting me and filling me with enthusiasm & i was\
  \ already so excited, I wanted to go to the pichola lake to imprints the beauty\
  \ and peace of the environment. But i needed to sleep so i went to my hotel and\
  \ 1st thing i did in the morning was to took a run towards lake pichola. I was astouned\
  \ to see the view in 5AM and it was a day before new year eve. It was peaceful.\
  \ All my tension about life was fading away , it was magical. I took the boat ride\
  \ at dawn and all i can think about the water splashing, the sunrise . It was 5\
  \ degrees. There were children playing at the ghat, birds were chirping and i was\
  \ in the moment where all i can think of was i wanna  married here, i wanna die\
  \ here and live here. After boat riding, i went into hotel to freshen up. Then i\
  \ had breakfast \" rajasthani food\". I explored different  ice creams in the market.\
  \ I went into city palace. I went in there because the movie \"YJHD\" was shooted\
  \ here. So i wanted reminiscence of the memories. Then i went to see temples and\
  \ did some shopping. At night i went to see karni mata temple through rope bay,\
  \ which is near the lake pichola. It was the highest point in the udaipur. At night\
  \ you can see whole of the city. And it was enchanting. The next day i was visiting\
  \ places outside of udaipur. Because i wanted to feel that city more and more. I\
  \ just wanted to capture the sun, air, everything of udaipur. At night, i went fatehsagar\
  \ lake. It was the new years eve. I was astouned to see the crowd. There were thousands\
  \ of people there, with hot coffee in one hand were sitting near the fireplace.\
  \ I went there i walked to 1 and half mile and all i could see was there were people\
  \ at everycorner of the lake enjoying the new years eve with friends and family.\
  \ I was very happy at that time. Because i wanted to be the part of this type of\
  \ crowd for like my whole life and it came true. I never thought i would witness\
  \ such a moment. It was a leap into unknown. People were walking, dancing, taking\
  \ pictures, playing games. It was amazing. I stayed there till 1 AM. We danced literally\
  \ on the river side for an hour. Everyone was happy. It was the moment when i realised\
  \ this is it. That is what i always wanted to be a part of. It gave me hope, happiness,\
  \ a different perspective of life. It gave me moments that i would cherish for my\
  \ whole life. And i would encourage people to have the same. \n\nSo that was my\
  \ travel story. Udaipur really became the life changing moment for me. Now whenever\
  \ i feel nostalgic i go through the pictures and videos i took from udaipur and\
  \ reminds me of the happy moments. Reliving those moment again and again feels like\
  \ i have achieved something in life and looking for greater perspective to achieve.\n\
