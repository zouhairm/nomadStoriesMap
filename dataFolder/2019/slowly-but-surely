Text: "A recent travelling experience to France was an incredible eye opener to where\
  \ I'd been going wrong from a surburban student life on a council estate with normal\
  \ responsibilities to be thrust onto a plane with two of my closest friends and\
  \ up into the clouds and the swaying of the turbulence shook me out of my reverie.\
  \ I was no longer in the UK. It was marvellous. The language difference, the smells\
  \ of fresh bread and array of cheese were not met but the rush of people in fabulous\
  \ clothing was juxtaposed with the culture shock of seeing the homeless setup under\
  \ the huge bridge while we sped our way to a hotel in the lap of luxury. It makes\
  \ you realise how lucky we had been. I'd been dreaming of going since I was a little\
  \ girl. The announcements still flashing through my head from the airport, the atmosphere\
  \ was completely alien, I don't think I heard a word of English other than ourselves\
  \ for at least 2 days. The flashback of French lessons in high school of half-remembered\
  \ phrases while I doodled on my exercise books the image of the Eiffel Tower. The\
  \ way we had booked tourist tours to see the city and managing to get lost and the\
  \ continual journey on buses and trams and learning our way round by frantically\
  \ hoping we'd find somewhere familiar. Not our lucky day. But little did we know\
  \ that after a couple of hours we'd be rewarded with the sight of a panoramic view\
  \ of the Seine, the Eiffel Tower and the Champs Elysees and in the distance, the\
  \ sea. It was a wonderful moment. The gush of pride while I sang La Mer extremely\
  \ loudly and my friends being extremely embarrassed of my lack of care towards public\
  \ entertainment. I was having fun and that was all that matters.\nI stood there\
  \ for a moment before spotting an over-sized bright green bench that no longer made\
  \ me feel like the giant I so often did at 5 foot 9. \nIt was all a blur after that,\
  \ the nighttime brought buskers with a speaker blasting music that wafted over the\
  \ area and we were met with the Eiffel Tower looming over us, as if it was hiding\
  \ down a side street. \nThe next couple of days brought a hop on hop off bus of\
  \ the city which fascinated me, the museums, the grandeur, the artworks and architecture\
  \ did not fail me! I was enthralled and there was no way of telling me I had to\
  \ go home. I was in love. \nThe next day brought more use of public transport to\
  \ the wonder that is Disneyland, which somehow brings the joy it did as a little\
  \ girl.  \nI think we all took a collective deep breath before entering because\
  \ it was such an intense artifice but glorious to three big children. All I wanted\
  \ to do was sing every Disney song I knew but I was drowned out by the continuous\
  \ noise of chatter and music over tannoy systems. The stream of money showed in\
  \ its own grandeur and the smiles on the childrens faces and the pure boredom on\
  \ the parents that accompanied them. \nThe marvel of the nostalgia that each step\
  \ brought. And the constant awakening of new sights, smells of candyfloss, fresh\
  \ flowers and popcorn took me back to my time working in a cinema.\nAll I can say\
  \ is the overwhelming kindness I felt of the French made a huge difference to my\
  \ holiday and would highly recommend. I am now increasingly passionate in my love\
  \ of travelling. Rekindled by visiting somewhere I'd dreamed of as a small child.\
  \ The food, well known of France is a surprising benefit, the escargot and frog\
  \ legs were delicious and simply cooked and each dish cooked with love. \nThe change\
  \ suited me and I would love to go again.\nA bientot!"
