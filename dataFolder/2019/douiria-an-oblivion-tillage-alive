Text: "Douiria\nan oblivion tillage alive.\n\nclimbing up the  rocky decayed stairway\
  \ in a blemished byway, ambivalent where of we will be spending the night as we\
  \ follow our guide Jamal, and as I traipse up every stair, I meditated over the\
  \ divine towering  soprano atlas mountains. little did I know, with meager and sullied\
  \ discolored clothes, a few boys and girls swarmed  my thoughts impending me for\
  \ a good concession over their local handicraft while some were simply and innocently\
  \ asking:\"please just 1 Dirham\".\n\nwe entered a cimmerian foyer, odor of  old\
  \ archaic clay making me reminisce memories only I have  been dreaming of, as we\
  \ march, my fingers trailing ethereally over the grimy wall  as bitty sandy driblet\
  \ fall off the ground, and voices calling: \"Merhaba, Merhaba\" then realization\
  \ rushed in me as we were de facto in a house. there was first  a small indoor cow\
  \ sanctuary, onward, lights off on a salon but I was spellbound by the ambrosial\
  \ cooking smell from an open door kitchen on my left, diversiform serving tableware\
  \ and some decrepit domestic utensils bedizening bulk of the wall, it was small\
  \ but cozy enough for the adept ladies cooking. we passed a few more closed doors\
  \ then up to the terrace, where we will be having dinner and spending the night,\
  \ in that Douiria.   \n\non the floor, we sat encircling plastic tablecloth sheathing\
  \ red and golden-tinged traditional Moroccan rugs, while different family members\
  \ served us a three-course meal dinner. olive oil, tomato and onion salad is always\
  \ a first choice of entr\xE9e in Moroccan homes, we had it with Zaalook, garlic\
  \ and herbs mashed eggplant, followed by Kseksou, topped with various vegetables\
  \ and chickpeas all dressed in one single Gasria, and with no single spoon being\
  \ served, we took our hint and started eating. Finishing with nebulous slices of\
  \ ruddy verdant watermelon we headed to catch after sunset feelings on a cornered\
  \ balcony where the floor was delicate and light enough to churn beneath us upon\
  \ precipitous forcible movements, ergo, we had to amble with great canniness and\
  \ heed. I gazed in pride and extreme beatitude on the eternal alluring beauty surrounding\
  \ me, blanched dusky sky leaving little space for eleventh hour sunbeams molding\
  \ mountains' dimness, ample lands of olive trees surrounding ancient amended clay\
  \ homes, while stray dogs never hushes.\n\ndescending back to the salon, two seating\
  \ areas facing each other crowned by wooden sticks and two lamps sending warmth\
  \ and fervor to whoever comes in, we sat on compressed dense mattress with some\
  \ of us sitting on mini wooden palm leaf chairs getting even a better view of an\
  \ age-old lady, navy Caftan on as she kept eye contact and a benign smile with each\
  \ one in the room.  sitting collinear at  the centermost and with adroit courtesy\
  \ and fortitude, Lalla Rahma began her speech. Her husband passed away 2 years ago\
  \ only for her to devote herself and safeguard a whole household with almost 20\
  \ people living all together, they entered the room, from a sister of hers to their\
  \ grandchildren they stood  like a choir, and started introducing themselves one\
  \ by one. \"It's the little things we do together that keeps us hearty and blessed\"\
  - she added, and with little room left, a folkloric dance group, installed their\
  \ Darboukas and Bendirs, Lalla Rahma  poured us mint tea and motioned for the party\
  \ to begin."
