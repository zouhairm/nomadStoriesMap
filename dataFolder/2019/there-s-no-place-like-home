Text: "We often take our birthplace for granted, knowing it so well seems to render\
  \ your own town a familiar landscape devoid of mystery and uniqueness. So rarely\
  \ in my life have I sat in the local pub and paid special attention to its richness\
  \ of character and story. However, in a Clown College there's no class clown; nobodies\
  \ a clown because everyone is a clown. So, with that said, this travel story is\
  \ of a wonderful place, a place I know well, a place I've often taken for granted,\
  \ and that place is Dublin. \n\nWhen we think of travel we think it to entail vast\
  \ distances. It's only travel if you leave your city or country, isn't it? Well,\
  \ any destination requires travel, even if it's ten minutes away. So I travelled\
  \ Dublin, from my locale of Ballyfermot, an suburban town with a dodgy reputation.\
  \ \n\nFor years I've remained unconvinced that Dublin had anything to offer because\
  \ I like a tourist I had the disadvantage of being familiar with it, knowing it\
  \ intimately. But, on its surface a true local won't see any splendor, until they\
  \ look deeply into its soul. And after setting out to experience something I know\
  \ in a way I never had before, I found the mystery and splendor I sought. \n\nUs\
  \ Irish, known for potatoes, putting up a good fight, being\" the best [football]\
  \ fans in the world\" and drinking alcohol like it's water and nothing to us, are\
  \ actually much more than alcoholics with cheerful attitudes. I sat, for what feels\
  \ like the millionth time, in my local pub Downey's, and noticed something I hadn't\
  \ before: The same group of elderly men, caught in an era passed and which endowed\
  \ them with unsavoury ideas, always had a story and I never listened. \n\nOne day,\
  \ I decided to introduce myself and the great old Irish pastime of storytelling\
  \ came rocketing through the oft clicky atomosphere. They spoke of troubling times,\
  \ the wedding software their sons and daughters, the wars their granddad's fought\
  \ in, the myths of the Celts. It was astonishing, and the entire pubs occupants\
  \ had surrounded us by the time the stories neared their ends. It was the most Irish\
  \ thing I'd ever experienced. \n\nFrom there, myself and my friends went on our\
  \ usual jump from the local to the City Centre, ending up in a newish bar called\
  \ \"The Jar\". The Jar is vibrant, full of unique, yet younger characters but as\
  \ rich with story as any local elder, albiet not as historic. Feeling the buzz of\
  \ traditional patriotism from the prior stories of old Ireland in my local, of passed\
  \ the iconic Phil Linnet statue on the way to the Jar, the feeling was one of ecstacy\
  \ and pride, I was new in Ireland despite living there my whole life. \n\nAt the\
  \ Jar, I'd engaged in the great old Irish tradition of \"getting pissed\", and spent\
  \ time introducing myself to strangers with the sole purpose of gaining their stories.\
  \ The nightlife is one of energy and wonder if like most cities I've been lucky\
  \ enough to visit. Dublin is a wonderful place, take one or loads of the many tours\
  \ on offer like the Jameson Whisky Museum, or the Ghost Bus your which takes you\
  \ to locations haunted in Irish lore. There's so much to do, and it's all about\
  \ a deep human experience in story form. I've realised that story itself is our\
  \ true national treasure, the most notable trait of the Irish. \n\nWe are a nation\
  \ of storytellers, we are a nation with a wealth of uniqueness and character. And\
  \ it's about time I understood it, and my Irish pride is restored.\n\nWhile not\
  \ your traditional travel journalism, the goal is to inspire in you, the reader,\
  \ an appreciation for and pride in your own city, your own town and your own country;\
  \ discover or rediscover its history, it's character and characters, look beyond\
  \ the obvious and indulge in the beauty of your hometown and city, you may need\
  \ that before you can truly appreciate the beauty of elsewhere."
