Text: "End of last year I had to make a decision either to apply for a job or \nto\
  \ leave Germany for an unspecified time and go travelling around the \nworld. Eventually\
  \ I chose the second option, bought an airline ticket \nfrom Frankfurt to Mexico\
  \ City and my adventure began. As I started my \njourney I didn't know how long\
  \ it would take and where it would finally \ntake me. There were just two things\
  \ which counted: First I did not want \nanother airline travel until flying back\
  \ to Germany \u2013 according to the \nSwedish slogan #jagstannarp\xE5marken that\
  \ reminds us to avoid journeys by \nplane in order to protect the climate. Second\
  \ I not only wanted to see \ntouristic places but meet as many local people as possible\
  \ to get a \ndeeper insight into local life in another part of the world and make\
  \ \nlong-term friendships.\nIn order to realize this I registered on the platform\
  \ Couchsurfing which \noffers excellent opportunities to not only save a lot of\
  \ money but also \nconnect to locals in an easy way. The platform offers a wide\
  \ range of \npossibilities. You can search for hosts at a place where you want to\
  \ go, \nstudy the profiles of members, create public trips or use the Hangouts \n\
  application to connect spontaneously with people in the city. I was not \nonly hosted\
  \ by a dozen of people so far, but incredible experiences came \nalong with my stays\
  \ at their homes. I lived with families, children and \ngrandparents, people who\
  \ showed me around their cities or villages, \nshared their food with me and took\
  \ me to their working places like e.g. \na little corner shop in which they have\
  \ been working their whole life. \nAlso Couchsurfers always introduced me to their\
  \ friends. So it came that \nmy host Araceli got a visit from her former fellow\
  \ student Daniela from \nthe other side of the country. We spent one day together\
  \ and I was \nspontaneously invited to her wedding which then took place one month\
  \ \nlater in a little village within the mountains. There I was not only a \nguest\
  \ but also helped to prepare the traditional food the day before the \nparty started\
  \ and on the wedding day I acted as the main photographer. I \nhad the honour to\
  \ experience hundreds of beautiful moments with numerous \npeople and I also got\
  \ deep insights in cultural problems and ongoing \naffairs within Mexico. During\
  \ the first weeks of January there had been \na lack of petrol in many states within\
  \ the country which affected the \nlives of the whole population. This shortage\
  \ resulted in kilometre-long \nqueues, people waiting up to more than 24 hours in\
  \ their cars or \nsometimes on foot to buy a few drops of petrol. Just imagine certain\
  \ \nprofessions like taxi drivers and it will become clear that the \nsituation\
  \ was very precarious for many. This lack was caused by the \ninitiative of the\
  \ new president of Mexico who wanted to fight against \nthe robbery of petrol. During\
  \ that period I was staying only a few \nkilometres away from a place where a helicopter\
  \ went down. According to \nofficial media reports the governor and ex-governor\
  \ of the state Puebla \nwere travelling in the helicopter. Later I found out that\
  \ this \ninformation did not entirely correspond to the truth as the governor \n\
  checked in at a hotel in Las Vegas the next day. So it was a fake death \ninitiated\
  \ to eliminate problems. Next to cultural experiences like \nlearning dance moves\
  \ of Salsa, Cumbia, Norte\xF1o or Huapango I climbed \nmountains, active volcanoes,\
  \ visited idyllic beaches, dreamlike hot \nsprings and archaeological sites. Mexico\
  \ is a country which offers \neverything you can imagine: Futuristic metropolitan\
  \ areas right next to \nimpoverished slums, one of the worlds richest cuisines,\
  \ villages where \npeople speak neither English nor Spanish but just their native\
  \ language, \na lot of contamination and irrelevance when it comes to dealing with\
  \ \nplastics, overwhelming joy of living accompanied by daily parties of \nevery\
  \ kind and an amount of hospitality which I haven't experienced in \nany other country\
  \ so far."
