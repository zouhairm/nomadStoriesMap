Text: "It was hot, the boil the egg on the hood of the car type of hot. It was 5 am\
  \ as we lay in our converted van that we had parked on the side of a dirt road somewhere\
  \ in Utah. Beads of sweat had already begun to form and the sheet clung damply to\
  \ our bodies as we lay there in anticipation of the sunrise. As soon as the first\
  \ rays trickled over the horizon to light up the sky, the inside of our van, even\
  \ with every window open become an unlivable sauna.\nMy girlfriend and I had been\
  \ road tripping the USA for 6 weeks at this point in our converted 1987 Econoline\
  \ van, and early starts were soon habitual as the old girl lacked any form of air\
  \ conditioning. \nWe rolled out of our bed, slipped on our lightest clothes and\
  \ stepped outside hoping that a breath of wind could come and cool our sweat that\
  \ was already dripping from our brows.\nAlas, no wind was found, so we laced up\
  \ our boots, grabbed some water from our cooler which 12 hours ago was filled with\
  \ ice but now resembled a swimming pool, stashed some granola bars in our pockets\
  \ and marched into the canyon lands with our rucksacks clinging to our backs.\n\
  We were in search of some slot canyons, the type that twist and turn deep into the\
  \ earth with rings of yellow, red and orange circling their way around the rocks.\
  \ We planned on visiting the famed Antelope canyon, but upon finding out it was\
  \ heavily priced and overly touristy, we went searching for our own slice of canyon\
  \ heaven.\nWe walked along a dried river bed, once water had flown freely through\
  \ here, but now only the tumbleweeds and small lizards who scampered from shadow\
  \ to shadow called this place home. We pressed forward as the sun continued to climb\
  \ higher and intensify its already powerful rays. \nAfter a long stretch of walking,\
  \ we eventually found the location we had been searching for. Here the entrance\
  \ to the canyons beckoned us with open arms as an oasis from the sweltering temperatures\
  \ and the start of our adventure, the rucksacks were dropped to the floor and only\
  \ the necessities were picked for the next section of our venture. While our bags\
  \ were off, and our shirts clung tightly to our dripping backs, the meekest of breezes\
  \ drifted through the canyon towards us and relieved us from overheating.\nWe then\
  \ walked into the canyon, twisting and turning through tight passageways that then\
  \ opened up into large caverns before being swallowed back in to the rock revealing\
  \ only the smallest of crevice in which to continue our exploration. And so we crawled,\
  \ climbed and clambered our way through the canyon, embracing its beauty, a sweat\
  \ laden hand mark on the rock wall would bring to life the plethora of colors that\
  \ glistened from the rocks, bands of crimson danced between sheets of yellow and\
  \ the most intense oranges would sparkle from every angle.\nWe pressed on until\
  \ we could advance no further, and it was here that we sat down and embraced the\
  \ silence. We chewed our granola bars slowly, and while the water had warmed some,\
  \ it still cooled us as we felt it trickle its way down our throats. We still had\
  \ to walk back along the river bed, and then drive at a snail's pace along a washboard\
  \ dirt road that battered and bounced our van every way imaginable, but it was here\
  \ in this canyon, away from everyone, surrounded only by rock walls and out of the\
  \ suppressing heat that we found a balance with nature. A connection that I did\
  \ not expect to find, but one that gave an almost spiritual awakening to the simplicity\
  \ of what man needs to find peace."
