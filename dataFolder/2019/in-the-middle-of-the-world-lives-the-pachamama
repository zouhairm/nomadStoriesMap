Text: "Ecuador is a country of contrasts. There is a mountain, there is a jungle,\
  \ there is a beach, there are cities and there are indigenous people. Exactly 14\
  \ different nationalities. My journey begins in the Amazon, in a place called Arajuno\
  \ located at the gates of the great jungle. I come to this community invited by\
  \ an indigenous leader I know in Quito. To come to this town there is a long road\
  \ by bus from the capital of Ecuador, then take another mini bus that takes a long\
  \ time to appear because it has rained and the road is not paved with and all is\
  \ full of mud. \n\nUpon my arrival in the community, they welcome me into Efren's\
  \ family. The first thing that strikes me about this place is its colors. It is\
  \ amazing how much vegetation there is per square meter. By the way, it is directly\
  \ proportional to the number of bugs and mosquitoes that exist. All avid, of course,\
  \ of the European blood. Important if you go to the Amazon, you must put mosquito\
  \ repellent from the first moment you wake up in the morning.\n\nReturning to the\
  \ arrival to Arajuno; The typical thing that they offer you is a glass of chicha.\
  \ Of course you should drink it. It is not necessary that you take everything, but\
  \ yes a sip since the container is passed between all those present. Chicha is a\
  \ liquid produced by indigenous women. They chew the yucca, spit it and leave it\
  \ to ferment.\n\nThe Amazonians always want the best for their guests, so I occupy\
  \ the eldest son's room. After many hours by bus I need a shower, but they did not\
  \ have it in the house because they bathe in the river. So I take my towel and together\
  \ with the whole family we go to bathe. It's funny because I had to bathe with a\
  \ shirt and pants. I could not be in a bikini. They are the reminiscences that remain\
  \ of evangelization.\n\nIn this area of the world they have a great respect for\
  \ nature. They call her the Pachamama and everything in her life revolves around\
  \ her. They greet the sun in the morning. They do not step on land that they consider\
  \ with ancestral seeds so as not to hurt the Pachamama, they take care of their\
  \ trees, their animals, their fruits. Practically all the inhabitants have a small\
  \ extension of land they call chakra. There they plant mostly yuccas and bananas\
  \ but you can also discover, for example, the fruit of cocoa. Sucking one of its\
  \ grains is like tasting the best chocolate in the world. Yes, one hundred percent\
  \ natural.\n\nReturning from the chakra my friend takes me to visit the shaman of\
  \ the community. He teaches me that there are no medicines there. Everything heals\
  \ with medicinal plants and the famous and feared nettles. Something they use mostly\
  \ for back pain but that patients do not like very much, mainly because they are\
  \ whipped with these plants. We will have to try it, but better on another trip.\n\
  \nArrival the night never lacks the celebration, neither the beer, nor the chicha\
  \ but this time well loaded of alcohol. It's amazing what they like to dance. It's\
  \ nice to dance their music because they all do it around a circle. That's part\
  \ of the dance because if there's one thing that's never missing in Ecuador, wherever\
  \ you are, it's salsa!\n\nThe Amazon is one of those places that you have to go\
  \ to at least once in your life because that's where you discover the magnitude\
  \ and power of nature. A paradise on earth where music plays and mosquitoes dance."
