Text: "Sometime in June 1858, my great, great grandfather, great grandmother and grandfather\
  \ depart from their home, somewhere in Northern/Western India towards, beginning\
  \ their long march towards the Port Of Bombay. They hope that when they get there\
  \ they will secure entry on to a ship. They do not know where this ship will take\
  \ them. But they do know this: whatever village they\u2019re from is not the place\
  \ to be a Dalit with a Muslim wife. They choose the unknown sea over being shunned.\
  \ \n\nTwo boats arrive. One is transporting spices to Zanzibar, the other, is transporting\
  \ indentured labourers to Trinidad. The docking of the boats prompts those waiting\
  \ to clammer for the opportunity to get onto either boat. The labourer handler \
  \ put everyone into two lines, but two others form.  My great grandmother is gradually\
  \ pushed out of the lines as the four lines re-merge into two during the boarding\
  \ of the ship. She tries to get back in, but she can\u2019t. My great grandfather\
  \ tries to look for her, but he can\u2019t risk losing their spot. It could be months\
  \ until another ship arrives. My grandfather catches sight of her. She\u2019s being\
  \ carried onto the other ship by the Muslim traders who assume she is a gift for\
  \ them. My great grandfather desperately attempts to get off the ship to get to\
  \  her, but he can\u2019t. The boats sail their separate ways.\n\nJune 30th, 2018.\
  \ This story pops into my mind as  I check into the ferry from Dar Es Salaam to\
  \ Zanzibar. Though more than a century has passed, the process of getting on the\
  \ boat remains complex procedure. Thankfully, unlike my great grandfather I don\u2019\
  t have to worry about losing my wife. I only worry about losing my backpack.  I\
  \ fend off an army of porters and make it to the waiting area and eventually to\
  \ the hold.  Three hours later, the ferry docks in Stone Town and I\u2019m received\
  \ by Kheri, my AirBnb host.\n\nHe asks me where I\u2019m from. I tell him Trinidad\
  \ and Tobago. He doesn\u2019t know it.  \u201CIt\u2019s in the Caribbean, near Jamaica.\u201D\
  \ The grin on his face when I say Jamaica makes it seem like he has 42 teeth. With\
  \ the Bob Marley bumping in the background, I realize that Kheri sounds like he\u2019\
  s from the Caribbean too .I enquire and he tells me he learned English from Reggae,\
  \ and that Reggae is one of the reason the Rastas of Zanzibar speak English so well.\n\
  We waste no time, since the journey to his house on the East Coast takes more than\
  \ an hour. The drive  transports me to a world I already know. On undersized and\
  \ winding roads, we traverse lush vegetation, hugging the coast at every opportunity.\
  \ On the way Kheri notices police and reaches into his pocket to grab a few shillings,\
  \ which he smoothly slips to them and speeds away. He explains to me: it's not enough\
  \ to be a bribe, but it's enough to feel like one if they don\u2019t have the time\
  \ to actually count it. I commit that to memory, so I can use the trick the next\
  \ time Tobago police tries to stop me.\n\n\nWe get to the beach. It's\u2019 a quiet\
  \ Wednesday night during Ramadan, I\u2019m the only tourist there. Kheri tells other\
  \ locals that a Jamaican is in town, and within minutes they\u2019re demanding to\
  \ smoke a joint with me. We gather around one of many fires lit in pits dug into\
  \ the sand, that keep the mosquitoes and sandflies away. Kheri slides next to me\
  \ and tells me that you can see on TV, you can see in the flames. I look at the\
  \ Bush TV in silence. Slowly I begin to realize the beauty of this moment. Its a\
  \ stranger moment than it should be. I tell Kheri: \u201Dso many Americans, Europeans,\
  \ Chinese visit here. They visit Trinidad too. But when I visit here, it feels like\
  \ I\u2019m coming home. Isn\u2019t it strange we never visit each other\u201D\n\n\
  I see my great grandparents reunited in the fire. They clasp hands again.\n\n\u201C\
  Sad brother, not strange. They always gonna try to divide us. But don\u2019 let\
  \ dem divide our minds.\u201D"
