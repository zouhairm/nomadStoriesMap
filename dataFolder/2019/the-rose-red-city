Text: "I had passed the shop earlier in the morning on the way into Petra. As a solo\
  \ traveler during the off tourist season, I am becoming accustomed to being a point\
  \ of interest in the street. Despite being alone, there have rarely been moments\
  \ of solitude, so I paid little attention this morning when yet another shop owner\
  \ beckoned me inside. Casually assuring him I\u2019d take a look on my way back,\
  \ I kept walking to the gates of the Petra Archaeological Park, eagerly anticipating\
  \ some illuminating glimpse into a culture that I\u2019d set out to discover 240\
  \ km away in Amman. Now I was passing by the same shop in the quiet dark of the\
  \ night, heading back to my hotel with dust in my hair and the beauty of this ancient\
  \ land on my mind. A voice comes from between the racks of postcards, asking me\
  \ if I am going to come inside as promised. My morning friend has remembered me.\
  \ He steps out from between the postcards with a big grin on his face and beckons\
  \ me inside. He\u2019s a young guy with a soft voice and well spoken English. His\
  \ store is much like the countless other tourist shops that line the main roads\
  \ into The Rose Red City. Desert inspired art and knick knacks of all kinds are\
  \ crammed between two floors, with the second floor mainly devoted to beautiful,\
  \ blown glass vases made by his father. The smell of meat and onions is heavy in\
  \ the air when we come back downstairs. My friend pulls two crates up to a fire\
  \ where a man is cooking and sits down, indicating I should join. The three of us\
  \ eat together and talk easily, although my friend is interrupted occasionally by\
  \ customers who trickle through late into the night. At one point they tell me excitedly\
  \ they have a car, and want to take me to their favourite place. I hesitate briefly\
  \ before accepting. Despite my positive experiences in Jordan so far, I am wary\
  \ of being whisked away too easily by promises of adventure. My morning friend takes\
  \ a heavy coat, fashioned in the style of the nomadic Bedouin, and a hat from a\
  \ nearby rack and hands them to me. We make our way outside to a brand new pickup\
  \ truck, a recurring theme in Jordan, and the three of us climb inside. Driving\
  \ through the small town it\u2019s dark and deserted. The few street lights allow\
  \ glimpses of empty, dirt laneways that wind past quiet homes and we traverse an\
  \ endless maze of these until I give up trying to keep track. We come to the base\
  \ of a steep hill and the truck starts to bounce its way up. I nestle deeper inside\
  \ my coat and hope for the best, although my guides seem unfazed, and later rather\
  \ than sooner we come to a stop upon the summit. The town is spread out below us\
  \ and the stars above. The few street lights melt away into darkness at the edge\
  \ of town, encircled by the distant lumps of hills. Wolf calls carry on the wind,\
  \ reminding me we\u2019re not the only ones prowling through the night. Arabian\
  \ wolves and striped hyenas are both native here. The bonnet of the truck is popped\
  \ open and light floods across the dirt and rocks and the crouched figures of my\
  \ friends as they get a fire going and the obligatory tea brewing. Rituals completed,\
  \ a handmade rebab is brought forward. A curious violin like instrument, this particular\
  \ rebab has a body fashioned from an old oil can and a bow made from camel hair.\
  \ I came here in search of a glimpse into a rich and colourful culture by looking\
  \ through the lense of the past, when instead it\u2019s most beautiful and defining\
  \ nuances can be found in the simplicities of daily life. I listen to the music\
  \ while sipping tea and wondering how I got here. My morning friend can sing, and\
  \ his voice floats past us to mingle with the distant cries of the wolves as I sit,\
  \ bundled in my borrowed nomad\u2019s coat, on a hill in The Rose Red City."
