Text: "I\u2019m officially stuck. To the wobbly, bright red, plastic chair. Suddenly\
  \ aware of a ticklish sensation, as sweat droplets slide precariously down my calf.\
  \ Beads of perspiration form simultaneous on my forehead. It\u2019s a relentless\
  \ 36 degrees, the fans are spinning, but you can\u2019t tell. The Kuala Lumpur humidity\
  \ has got me good. I scan the sea of red, depicting menu items and contemplating\
  \ what several high vis vests and their inhabitants are devouring. It\u2019s Kopi\
  \ time. Which means coffee; of the deep, cloying and iced variety. I keep watching,\
  \ armed with intense thirst and an edible inquisition. \n\nGetting here was interesting.\
  \ I bypass makeshift tables covered in plastic buckets, each filled with numerous\
  \ nasi lemak offerings and a rainbow handled spoon to match. Dishing up fiery maroon\
  \ curries, crunchy miniature fish, glossy chicken limbs and cylindrical chilly bins\
  \ housing fluffy rice. Transfixed by the sheer choice, I watched a Malaysian Aunty\
  \ scoop haphazard combinations into brown paper cones. Corrupted by alluring pastry\
  \ stalls, my stomach gurgles in anticipation of breakfast. \n\nPlodding precariously\
  \ (and sweatily!) through the dusty, disheveled streets, with only google to thank.\
  \ I dodge construction machinery, yappy scooters and men in fluorescent hard hats.\
  \ I spot a scene that takes my mind straight to a soap box TV drama\u2026an over\
  \ possessive girlfriend who threw her man and all his belongings out on the street,\
  \ with no remorse. I chuckle at myself, and keep walking, having still got a way\
  \ to go. Did I mention its hot? My eyes are glued to the lit screen, as I follow\
  \ my dotted self on the blue path, fearful to deviate from the direction of Chicken\
  \ Hor Fun. \n \nA pitcher of sweetened caffeine is set down in front of me. A sign\
  \ the unctuous, silky rice noodles are close. There\u2019s an obvious flow here.\
  \ The Kopi in the corner takes the lead and comes with strict instructions. \u201C\
  No drink, no sit\u201D. Between the roaming cat, whole roasted chickens being ferried\
  \ from the kitchen on wire hooks, and a severely male slanted gender presence. It\u2019\
  s hard to be discrete. I can feel the eye balls. An imposter of sorts. Yet all I\
  \ can think about is the succulent slithers of chicken breast, lathered in a deeply\
  \ roasted garlic oil.\n\nI spy a bubbling metal stock pot, divided in two, one with\
  \ a slick of oily yellow residue, which means only one thing. FLAVOUR. A burnt-orange\
  \ plate is delivered. It\u2019s beautiful. A generous heap of springy white noodles,\
  \ perched in a thin, brown sauce. The chicken laid decoratively on top. A lime green\
  \ spoon and condiment bowl to match. I\u2019m going in\u2026 Manoeuvring chopsticks\
  \ deep into the plate, drenching each strand in a dark blanket until it reaches\
  \ a pale shade of brown. Perfection. I attempt to devour every millimetre in the\
  \ mound of rice lengths. Pausing to breathe mid-mouthful, assessing locals to confirm\
  \ I\u2019m \u2018doing it right.\u2019 \n\nMid gob-full of noodles, I\u2019m interrupted\
  \ by a mature, toothless, Malaysian man who almost walks on by. With a sparky, gaping,\
  \ crooked smile he reaches a warm open hand out towards me. I gasp internally, yet\
  \ smile back. A deep, chirper voice bellows the familiar phrase, \u201CHello\u201D\
  , he exclaims. My sweat-bead ridden forehead lifts to lock eye contact with this\
  \ stranger. A firm, modest shake exchanged, despite particularly moist palms on\
  \ my part. Next, a combination of two words, powerful in their own right and symbolic\
  \ when mentioned together. \n\n\u201CYou beautiful\u201D he blurted out. Did I hear\
  \ that right? I muttered a comical and rather sheepish, \u201CThank you\u201D in\
  \ response. More tooth and toothless smiles and giggles followed and next thing\
  \ I knew he had walked on out. \n\nSomehow this stranger was convinced that a flustered,\
  \ sweltering, jet-lagged tourist deserved to be on the end of a surprisingly chivalrous\
  \ compliment. Baffled at the irony of feeling at my worst, while this man, somehow\
  \ saw me at my beaming best. Sitting alone, captivated in a state of euphoria and\
  \ profound vulnerability. Here. At the Mei Sin Kopitiam. In the outskirts of Kuala\
  \ Lumpur, bred a moment of unique, unadulterated connection. One bite and I was\
  \ infatuated. One look, and clearly so was he."
