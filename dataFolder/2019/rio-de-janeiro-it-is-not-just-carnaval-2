Text: "The first thing that people think about Rio de Janeiro is: the city of \"Carnaval,\
  \ samba and beautiful beatches\"! Yes, that's true that we have it in the city,\
  \ but it not just it. We have people from all around the world in Rio, and that's\
  \ the magic about it. \nThe first time I went there, I did not expect meet people\
  \ from a lot of different countries. That is a big surprise for me and a good one!\
  \ Meet people from other cultures means change experiences, languages and especific\
  \ traditions. I met some Dutch girls that told me about the difference about our\
  \ lunch, for example. Here, in Brazil, it is a tradition you eat rice, beans, sort\
  \ of meat and some vegetables. They said to me that in Holland, they used to have\
  \ a quickly lunch, and they just eat some bread or something like hamburgues, fast\
  \ things. So, the big point about met and know new people it is the experiences\
  \ that we can have and share!\nMe and the Dutch Girls, Fleur and Rowan, became friends\
  \ at Rio. We went to \"Cristo Redentor\", \"P\xE3o de A\xE7\xFAcar\", beaches like\
  \ \"Ipanema\" and \"Copacabana\". They loved it and me too, because, how I already\
  \ said, it was my first time there too. We had a great experience at Rio together,\
  \ we went to some parties, met I lot of new people, from China, Belgium, South Africa\
  \ and Mexico. \nTherefore, the mainly topic about everything it is: do not expect\
  \ something about your trip or maybe your life, because you always don't know what\
  \ you will see and what you can share with people that you will meet at the place\
  \ you are going to! Don't be afraid about it too, always be open to know something\
  \ new, be free from prejudices, you will be a better and a happier person."
