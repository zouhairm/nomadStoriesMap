Text: "From the first working day I count on Malta I hear about how an island is more\
  \ beautiful than Malta. Is it possible? At first Gozo throws us into a typical American\
  \ film where one of the roles has a dog with that name. The legend says it is more\
  \ beautiful, cleaner than Malta. I do not believe. That something like that is possible.\
  \ Ten of us got together. We decided to rent a car and directly to Gozo. One gas\
  \ station near our apartment rented cars. The problem was that he was driving to\
  \ Malta on the left. The driving decision fell to men. At the end of a couple of\
  \ blocks away, we realized that something was wrong with our car. However, as it\
  \ is all day and a mile away in front of us, the agency guarantees us, we contacted\
  \ friends from another car and told us to come back and look for a new one. Even\
  \ though all this is done by us for an additional half hour, we continue on. We\
  \ drive to Malta to the port where we cross the ferry to the island of Gozo. The\
  \ first station is the Azure Window, unfortunately has been stormed in March 2017.\
  \ We were lucky to have memories while still being one of the main attractions on\
  \ that island. Finally we are there, stopping at the first hidden beach because\
  \ it's over 35 degrees in the air, and it's not even 10 am. But the day is ahead\
  \ of us. Otherwise, the whole team prefer hidden beaches because they are the most\
  \ beautiful and are not crowded with tourists, but it is worth every minute although\
  \ it is sometimes difficult for them to come. We ride through the very center of\
  \ the island and aim for the beach on the other end of the island, also a hidden\
  \ cove where Angelina and Brad Pitt last filmed together. So at least the locals\
  \ say. We stay about three hours on the same to enjoy and catch the break, although\
  \ we plan to go through as many things as we have imagined, we still leave places\
  \ for enjoyment. The way to the beach leads through the farms held by the locals.\
  \ As we were driving, the Spansh driver could not remember the English word for\
  \ the cow, so he just said that. For the first we did not know what he was thinking,\
  \ but it was a funny situation. So one of them came up with the idea of \u200B\u200B\
  returning that part of the story to the record with a picture and creating a lifelong\
  \ memory. That's how this picture came up with our cow Manuelita. And today I am\
  \ one of the favorite memories of Malta. These are the situations that happen spontaneously\
  \ and totally unconnected. At the end of our visit to the island, we go to the red\
  \ sand beach where we spend hours of work before we go back to Malta. As the plans\
  \ are constantly changing, both in life and on travel, we go to the heart of the\
  \ island for the very end, into the center and climb on the citadel and hunt down\
  \ the sunset. Honestly, he is not exactly the one in Malta, but still beautiful.\
  \ I'm thinking of how they told me it was more beautiful and cleaner than Malta.\
  \ I caught myself for a moment how really and I think so. For a moment. Maybe some\
  \ parts are. But everything is hasty, there is no calm like that in Malta. To understand,\
  \ Mlata also has a busy day, but when some place / country gets to heart, it's hard\
  \ to find a replacement. Whatever it was. In addition to all other countries. Malta\
  \ has won my heart. It will be difficult to remove from that number one. Somehow\
  \ I think. Forever."
