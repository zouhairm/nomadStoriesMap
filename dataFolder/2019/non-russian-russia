Text: "I am Russian and I fairly claim that we hardly know our country. We are proud\
  \ of Russia, love and respect it, nevertheless travel and work, as a rule, abroad.\
  \ Some of us even dream of leaving the country. Didn\u2019t it has place to live\
  \ here? No, there\u2019s another point. We don\u2019t see! Or we don\u2019t want\
  \ to see. Russia is a storehouse of splendid places. And Bashkiria, where I happened\
  \ to travel, is one of them. \nBashkiria is Russian region, that was formed on an\
  \ ethnic concept. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a feeling of being abroad while traveling\
  \ to Bashkiria. Inhabitants lead their own cultural and religious life. The vast\
  \ majority of them are Asians. It\u2019s rarely happen to hear Russian speech in\
  \ Bashkiria, though in Ufa - capital of the region - many people speak Russian.\
  \ Going deep into Bashkiria, u start to hear only Bashkir language or unpleasant\
  \ to ears accents. The deeper the cooler!..\nI was lucky to visit 6 Bashkiria\u2019\
  s districts: Baimaksky, Abzelilovsky, Mechetlinskiy, Haybullinsky, Beloretsk and\
  \ Burzyansky, and u can\u2019t even imagine how splendid it was!\nSpeaking about\
  \ three first districts, they all spread out on hilly plains, overgrown with mixed\
  \ forests. There are a lot of mountains and hills in Bashkiria. And Baimaksky district\
  \ is known for its abundance of ponds and camp sites. The most well-known lakes\
  \ are Kultuban, Talkas; the rivers are Sakmar, Tanalyk, Tuyalyas and a pond with\
  \ a children's camp \u201CGrafskoe\u201D. \nHaybullinsky is a yellow sunny steppe,\
  \ overgrown with a feather grass. But the greatest impression was made by dense\
  \ forests on mighty high mountains. I am talking about two other districts, Burzyansky\
  \ in particular. I became a frequent guest of it!\nMy travels started back in 2015,\
  \ and, I can tell for sure, the infrastructure has become better since that times.\
  \ And the asphalt has become smoother, though it disappoints many tourists, who\
  \ came for peculiar experience. But I am glad for local people. Life conditions\
  \ are severe there. The most convenient way to travel in Bashkiria is travelling\
  \ by car, cause scheduled buses stop no more than twice an hour, and bus terminals\
  \ are very far away. And the only drawbacks of travelling by car is the height of\
  \ the road, resembled a serpentine one, and some abrupt turns. Bashkir roads, like\
  \ a snake, twist between all these hazards and there\u2019s a constant feeling in\
  \ the air of falling into the gorge. \nBlah blah blah \nI AM VERY SORRY, I BECAME\
  \ AWARE OF THIS CONTEST JUST BEFORE FEW HOURS TILL THE END \nAND I WILL NOT MANAGED\
  \ TO FINISH IT, BUT I HOPE THIS WILL BE ENOUGH FOR YOU TO FIND OUT THAT MY ENGLISH\
  \ AND WRITING SKILLS ARE GOOD (I TRULY BELIEVE THEY ARE) \nAND IF I AM HAPPY TO\
  \ WIN THIS COMPETITION, I WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT BASHKIRIA"
