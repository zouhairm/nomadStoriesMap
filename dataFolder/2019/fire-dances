Text: "Cambodia is the land where I am originally from, my parents having fled after\
  \ the Killing fields and arriving in New Zealand as refugees in the early 1980\u2019\
  s.\n\nIt\u2019s the land of my blood, it is also a strange land that I know little\
  \ about.   I\u2019ve spent less time there than I have in New Zealand, each time\
  \ I go I notice the difference, the fast changes, how it breathes, smells and tastes\
  \ different yet strangely familiar.  Like a relative or dear friend that I get to\
  \ visit every 10 years.  Every time we meet, I notice how we have both changed,\
  \ grown together and apart, in some moments we have less in common than I realize,\
  \ we have different beliefs and political views, and most of the time we do not\
  \ agree, but I love them no less.\n\nIn 2003 I went back for my second trip.  A\
  \ mother daughter trip, except that two weeks in she announces that she is leaving\
  \ me, she couldn\u2019t hack it, \u201Cthe heat\u201D she said.  I was to remain\
  \ by myself.  I ended up on a trip to Mondulkiri with my flamboyant American Aunt.\
  \  So, to Mondulkiri we went. At that time spare for a few huts and maybe one hotel\
  \ it really was just a sea of mountains and windy open space. \n\nI remember my\
  \ Aunt pointing out the indigenous minority people walking along the dirt paths,\
  \ giant sacks on their backs, as our van hurled past kicking up orange dust towards\
  \ their faces \u201CIt\u2019s so beautiful, I hope these people will always live\
  \ like this, I hope they never change\u201D she said wistfully.  I remember thinking\
  \ at the time easy for you to say lady, you get to go home to your mansion in America,\
  \ with your air-con and your dishwasher. These guys are walking 40 kilometres twice\
  \ a day just to go to the market to barter for a few roots and vegetables.  It was\
  \ an odd notion, to think that we would want them to remain pure, yet we would go\
  \ back to our modern lives. Something about my aunt\u2019s statement stuck with\
  \ me, like how neurotic and busy our lives were in comparison.    I couldn\u2019\
  t deny that their lives looked hard but there seemed something honest and simple\
  \ about the way they lived, I imagined how it would be to not have modern cares,\
  \ for a moment I envied them.  \n\nOne cold evening we drove out deep into a village,\
  \ some of the villages were in indigenous dress but surprisingly most of them were\
  \ wearing modern clothes, pants and woollen jerseys.  Children and animals ran about,\
  \ the adults upon spotting us scrambled to get out of their modern clothes and into\
  \ indigenous dress, while the rest tended to a big fire. \n\nWe huddle in a big\
  \ circle around the fire, the sound of gongs clanging for the dance, their bodies\
  \ begin to jut back and forth to the rhythm as they sing and make their way around.\
  \ The fire crackles and the smoke dies down, I am mesmerized.  I lean into it, but\
  \ then slowly something else becomes apparent, something much like, panic and shame.\
  \ The realization that this moment that I was experiencing was not amazing, it wasn\u2019\
  t even organic, in fact we had paid for this very experience. We had come in with\
  \ our tour guide, in a van to make these people change into their indigenous dress\
  \ while it was fucking freezing, to entertain us.  This was all for us because we\
  \ paid for it!  \n\nI let this sink in and as my thoughts progress, I realize something\
  \ else, no it\u2019s both.  It must be both, both ugly and beautiful, and that I\
  \ couldn\u2019t stop it, any of it.  That life is change, that we are all always\
  \ changing and that I too had to accept it, they had.  \n\nMaybe I\u2019ll never\
  \ like it or get used to it, but this is what it was.  Lastly, I realize that my\
  \ checks are wet tears streaming down my face, I looked up at all the smiling faces\
  \ around me and I smile back, my tears drying as the fire continues to dance on\
  \ all our faces."
