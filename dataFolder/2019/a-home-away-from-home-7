Text: "The African plain seemed endless and my legs and back ached, but with every\
  \ mile we traveled my anticipation grew. Lives were going to change today. The sun\
  \ was beginning to set behind us, and we had been traveling since before it rose\
  \ that morning. Just when the dragging miles and monotonous scenery made it seem\
  \ like we would never arrive, our destination started to finally come into focus:\
  \ a range of short grassy mountains. Gazing into the foothills where I knew our\
  \ endpoint lay nestled, a smile touched my lips as I envisioned the village that\
  \ had been waiting weeks for our arrival - the embodiment of hospitality. \n\nDarkness\
  \ had fallen when we reached the front gate - an ancient iron door that could be\
  \ slid forward to block access to the village\u2019s only road. A sign just outside\
  \ of it read \u2018Kasansa\u2019. Momentarily forgetting about my discomforts, I\
  \ sat up in my seat. A lone generator powered a small set of lights that revealed\
  \ the way forward. The box truck labored on the rocky path up a steep hill that\
  \ cut the village in two. Although the sun had long since sank below the horizon\
  \ behind us, the remoteness of Kasansa allowed the brilliant moon and stars to light\
  \ up our surroundings almost like an overcast day. I had seen many villages already,\
  \ but I knew this one was special. We reached a flat area near the top and the weary\
  \ truck at long last came to a stop. The journey was finally at an end, and to replace\
  \ it was a glorious beginning. Opening the doors, a group of men rushed to greet\
  \ us, wholly enthusiastic despite the late hour. Introductions and greetings were\
  \ made in broken English, and the weeks of growing anticipation bubbled over into\
  \ excitement and joy. The group, three Americans and six Tanzanians, made its way\
  \ to the back of the truck, which was covered in a thin layer of reddish orange\
  \ African dirt. We undid the lock, and the cargo doors swung open to reveal the\
  \ contents\u2026\n\nWhen the unloading was finally finished, the padlock was replaced,\
  \ and the tired group breathed a collective sigh of relief. My phone, which hadn\u2019\
  t had reception in days, read 2 am. Soft chatter which had long since returned to\
  \ Swahili was just audible in the background as I stepped away from the group. The\
  \ refreshingly cool night breeze gently blew against my face, carrying on its back\
  \ the sweet scent of the wild African grasses. I gazed down the hill toward the\
  \ rest of the sleeping village, and smiled as I thought of the people, who would\
  \ be awakening in a few hours to find visitors among them. For some of the younger\
  \ ones, we would be the first white people, or mzungu, they had ever met. More importantly,\
  \ they would see the boxes of supplies and books we brought with us and know that\
  \ they were not forgotten - they were cared about. Their remote location was not\
  \ a barrier to them, young children could dream of travel and adventures, of learning\
  \ and achieving. Nothing was out of reach. I lifted my eyes beyond the village and\
  \ out across the vast plain. I thought back to the beginning of our journey. The\
  \ endless sea of twinkling stars above met the horizon, beyond which we had begun.\
  \ That felt like a lifetime ago. I laid back on the grassy hill and noticed a peculiar\
  \ sense, an absence within me. The thought troubled me at first, until I realized\
  \ what it was. As I gazed upwards at the night sky and the pieces of land that greeted\
  \ it, I realized that all the hustle and work and planning, all my worries and stresses,\
  \ lay far, far away. Beyond it those things raged on, and beyond it I had left them.\
  \ Here in Kasansa I was free to dream, to enjoy life, and to enjoy the people I\
  \ was with. I breathed deeply and closed my eyes. For the first time in two months,\
  \ I was home."
