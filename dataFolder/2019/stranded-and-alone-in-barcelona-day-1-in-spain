Text: "10 pm: Barcelona Nord Bus Station\n\nWith a break from teaching English in\
  \ France, I packed my rucksack knowing I would be travelling for two weeks but had\
  \ no idea where.\n\nMy six-hour FlixBus journey left Toulouse just 30 minutes after\
  \ I booked it.\n\nArriving at night, I received a message from my friend that I\
  \ was no longer able to stay with him.\n\nBedless in Barcelona, I frantically messaged\
  \ my friends from home who may know people nearby.\n\nI obviously had backup plans\
  \ such as staying in a hostel or Airbnb, but where is the fun in that?\n\nAs I waited\
  \ for my friends\u2019 replies and assured them I was safe, I revisited the Couchsurfing\
  \ requests I had sent out earlier that week.\n \nMost people declined because they\
  \ were out of town or busy. But one Couchsurfer, Fabio, replied and agreed to let\
  \ me make my overnight arrangements from his apartment.\n\nAt 11 pm, I began the\
  \ fifteen-minute walk to meet Fabio with zero expectations. As I stood in the lift\
  \ to his apartment, I started to wonder what I was getting myself into.\n\nLittle\
  \ did I know that my last-minute emergency shelter would become my Barcelona base\
  \ for the next five days.\n\nFabio, a smiley Brazilian web developer, moved to Barcelona\
  \ for work. Fabio\u2019s reluctance to host me was because he had thrown a party\
  \ the night before and during the clean-up operation, his washing machine handle\
  \ broke, leaving his damp towels and bedsheets stuck inside.\n\nFabio offered to\
  \ put me up for the night and I jumped at the opportunity. Giving me a set of keys\
  \ within less than an hour of knowing me, the trust was real and definitely reciprocated!\n\
  \nThat same night, Fabio invited me to a Brazilian music gig for the following day.\
  \ Loving all kinds of live music and having no plans, I, of course, said yes.\n\n\
  The next morning, we ate brunch together. Fabio made a jam\xF3n, guacamole and honey\
  \ panini; an unusual but delicious mix. We then made our way to a cultural bar called\
  \ El Taller.\n \nPotted plants hung upside down from the ceiling and the windows\
  \ of the bar were wide open, bringing in a gush of the warm autumn breeze. \n \n\
  We sat and listened to Brazilian band GANZ\xC1 with Mirla on vocals, Jonas on the\
  \ caj\xF3n and tambourine and Marcel on guitar. Mirla had a beautiful, soulful voice\
  \ that filled the room with tranquillity.\n\nThey played their own songs as well\
  \ as classics you would probably recognise like Mas Que Nada by Jorge Ben Jor.\n\
  \nTheir feel-good music transported me to the summer months and had us swaying in\
  \ our seats.\n \nThere was not another tourist in sight; I truly felt like a local.\n\
  \nFabio introduced me to his friends, who politely listened to my broken Spanish,\
  \ limited to the classic beginner\u2019s topics of introducing myself, talking about\
  \ my family and directions.\n\nAfter the concert, we walked to Nau Bostik, a vintage\
  \ market with food stalls. The walls were covered in street art. We looked around\
  \ the photography galleries and rummaged through the different fabrics and vibrant\
  \ colourful clothes, whilst drinking more Barcelona beer and soaking up the autumn\
  \ sunshine. I was introduced to more of Fabio\u2019s friends, all of whom said I\
  \ was lucky to be hosted by him. I definitely felt lucky!\n\nWe took the metro to\
  \ the Sagrada Familia. Two young men jokingly took the cap of another woman and\
  \ started dancing down the carriages. I wasn\u2019t sure whether this is the norm\
  \ - especially having been on the metro in other countries where people avoid any\
  \ eye contact.\n\nEmerging from the station, this was the first time I laid my eyes\
  \ on the beautiful gothic church that Gaudi designed and is still being built. Construction\
  \ started in 1882 and is not due to finish until 2026.\n \nWe walked around the\
  \ surrounding markets filled with the smells of fresh buttery crepes and olives\
  \ and the sounds of terrible children's karaoke, then we made our way back home.\n\
  \ \nThe connection I felt with Fabio and his friends was incredible, especially\
  \ considering I had known them for less than 24 hours. Being stranded was a blessing\
  \ in disguise."
