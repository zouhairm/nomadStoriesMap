Text: "Heart racing, legs quaking, my fingers curled around the yellow railing in\
  \ front of me. \n\nI wasn\u2019t scared of heights, but suspended hundreds of feet\
  \ in the air on a tiny spiral staircase, fear danced in my stomach. My feet lurched\
  \ forward hoping to hit the next step, praying to find solid ground. \n\nI didn\u2019\
  t expect the Kansas capitol building to be this terrifying. \n\nForced worksheets\
  \ and soggy turkey sandwiches aside, I\u2019ve always loved school field trips.\
  \ But today wasn\u2019t a school trip, today was a personal trip. Despite going\
  \ to school in Kansas, I knew little about the state\u2019s capital. \n\nMy friends\
  \ joked about Topeka being boring. What\u2019s special about the capital of a flyover\
  \ state? But I needed a break from college, from the mounting pressure to figure\
  \ out my life post-graduation. \n\nOur tour guide a thin, hunched-back man plowed\
  \ ahead. Byron must have been my grandpa\u2019s age, but he left the rest of us\
  \ in the dust. He summited the 296 steps several times a day. I pushed forward,\
  \ one more and one more and one more. We had finally reached the top. \n\nDowntown\
  \ Topeka stretched out below. Byron turned to me, pointing out a crooked main street,\
  \ grain silos, a government building that had been empty for years. He even pointed\
  \ out the school from the Brown v. Topeka Supreme Court case. All of this, only\
  \ 30 minutes away from where I live and go to school. \n\nI asked him if he grew\
  \ up here and Byron told me he was raised out east. He came to the Kansas for college\
  \ in 1963, but it wasn\u2019t his thing. Byron dropped out, fought in Vietnam, tried\
  \ school again, dropped out again, became a mechanic. \n\nAnd eventually, he returned\
  \ to school. In 2003, he graduated from KU having majored in Communications and\
  \ minored in African American Studies and Leadership.\n\n\u201CIt only took me 40\
  \ years, but I did it,\u201D he said with a smile. \n\nHere I was, not even 20 years\
  \ old, stressed about what I was going to do for the rest of my life. \n\n\u201C\
  Do you see the statue above us?\u201D he asked pointing to the top of the dome.\
  \ I nodded. \n\nIt was a Kansa warrior, a bow drawn in his hand, the arrow pointing\
  \ to North. A physical representation of the Kansas state motto \u201CAd astra per\
  \ aspera...Through difficulty to the stars.\u201D \n\nA reminder. Byron, like the\
  \ first settlers of the state, just came here. He was a student, a soldier, a mechanic,\
  \ a business owner, a graduate, a tour guide. He was someone who figured it out\
  \ an above all: a Kansan."
