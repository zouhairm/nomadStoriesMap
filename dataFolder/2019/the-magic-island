Text: "\u201CI believe the world is all magic, and we are just lucky to live in it.\u201D\
  \n\n        -Jim Hubbell, Artist\n\n \n\nWe\u2019ve arrived in Yantai, and today\
  \ we set off to find the English-speaking translator at the Penglai Pavilion. She\
  \ isn\u2019t available, and won\u2019t be until after 2pm, so we take a detour.\n\
  \nWe soon find ourselves at a small beach outlook above a pagoda and walls. We ask\
  \ the students from Yantai what the walls are guarding, and they tell us they protect\
  \ a magic island, but they can\u2019t explain much more. A few minutes go by and\
  \ I relay this mysterious story to a student from Russia. Vlad says, \u201CWell,\
  \ maybe the reason China has survived as a country so long is because they guard\
  \ their magic islands.\u201D\n\nThey believe in magic islands? They perceive magic\
  \ islands? Better yet, they guard these magic islands from a distance -- keeping\
  \ them safe and sacred without residing upon them? What can this be about?  \n\n\
  I am enamored with this mutual understanding of island and man, of nature and nation.\
  \ When we meet our English speaking tour guide, she guides us through the palace.\
  \ She seems unaffected by the July heat. We manage to keep up, stopping to sketch\
  \ occasionally, learning of a few of the many deities worshipped at this  singular\
  \ Buddhist temple near Yantai. At the end of the tour we reach the inside of the\
  \ guard walls and see the small beach from a new height.\n\nOur guide tells us that\
  \ every now and then a \u201Cmirage\u201D happens here --  a tiny island appears!\
  \ She directs our attention to two photos on a nearby wall, showing the island both\
  \ hidden and visible, and says, \u201CThe last time the island appeared was in 2009.\
  \ All of a sudden there was a lighthouse visible, and just nine minutes later it\
  \ was gone.\u201D I am astonished. I think that if a magic island, which last appeared\
  \ in 2009 for only nine minutes, once inspired an emperor to build a fortress replete\
  \ with myriad structures for peace and worship, then we, too -- our Yantai-Pacific\
  \ Rim Park team -- might harness a sliver of that magic for our park. For what about\
  \ this park is not magic? We seek a magic layered with cooperation, laid with our\
  \ handwork, all to revere nature\u2019s beauty.\n\nUnlike the shimmering, elusive\
  \ magic island, our park, this Yantai Pearl, will exist above sea level for some\
  \ years. Even if it sinks, or the sea rises to cover it, I walk away believing its\
  \ presence alone will soon inspire all who build, and many who visit, to consider\
  \ constructing new walls and pagodas of mutual understanding in their minds and\
  \ hearts."
