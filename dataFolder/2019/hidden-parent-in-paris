Text: "She blew the candles out on her birthday cake, and with her eyes still tightly\
  \ closed to make a wish, she heard \"Are you ready for your surprise?\" \nWhat happened\
  \ next was a wish she couldn't have imagined would come true in all her 10 years\
  \ of age.\n                                                                    \
  \                                 . . . \nFor as long as I can remember, my sister\
  \ has shared nearly everything with me.  Nothing of hers has ever quite fit me.\
  \ Her shoes and waist are much smaller than my own. Yet she has always allowed me\
  \ to try on pieces of her life.  This time, she let me squeeze into a costume of\
  \ motherhood.\n\nJade is my niece, my god-daughter and for a week in France, I was\
  \ her legal guardian. Tightly tucked between her stampless passport pages was a\
  \ permission note.  My declaration of guardianship notarized and signed by her parents\
  \ as a birthday gift to her.\n\nViewed as \"The Traveler\" of my family, it seems\
  \ as I am the only one to inherit a restless gene. My siblings and cousins my age\
  \ have all settled down with a spouse and/or children. So, blessed with limited\
  \ responsibilities and the liberty to do, I gladly offered to travel to Paris.\n\
  \nMy plan was not to linger anywhere, but to keep on the move, as though to create\
  \ in her mind one long panning shot, from Charles De Gaulle to the Arc de Triomphe;\
  \ to get up each morning and set off after breakfast, using every second of daylight,\
  \ and even some late nights to explore.\n\n17,036 steps. Jade's busy eyes were glued\
  \ to every window, street sign and storefront we passed while her tired feet flopped\
  \ as her slide-on sneakers scraped the sidewalks down Boulevard Beaumarchais.\n\n\
  We'd take turns sharing information about the City of Lights. I, pointing out the\
  \ quarter-scale replica Statue of Liberty as we walked along the Seine. She, pointing\
  \ out locations seen through the lens of Miraculous: Tales of Ladybug & Cat Noir\
  \ (an animated show set in Paris). I couldn't tell if any of my narrations left\
  \ a dent in her memory.\n\nMy niece and I relate in many ways. We're born and raised\
  \ in the same neighborhood 21 years apart. A neighborhood where immigrant families\
  \ travel \"back home\" annually but rarely travel anywhere else to simply explore.\
  \ This was our chance.\n\nI've developed a beautiful fake french accent, meaning\
  \ I pronounce American words in French. This inflection is just another outfit I\
  \ try on for auditory purposes.\n\nJade only truly cared about one thing\u2014Seeing\
  \ the Eiffel Tower. I had always associated this part of Europe with unsettled weather\u2014\
  chilly rain, and clouds of fog. My expectations were met as gray pinnacles of clouds\
  \ massed in the big sky ahead, creamy and marbled at their peaks revealing very\
  \ little of the Champ de Mars below. Jade's blow-dried hair quickly reverted to\
  \ its natural corkscrew coils as we approached. We tried three days in a row to\
  \ see it, but each attempt La Tour Eiffel eluded us into the whiteout of fog that\
  \ hid all but the base of the tower into the low hanging heavens.\n\nRavi, a kind\
  \ small-framed man who served our hotel breakfast each morning, would volunteer\
  \ to take our photos as if to spare my left selfie arm extending further away from\
  \ my body. \n\n \"Your daughter is very bright! You both speak and write in notebooks\
  \ every morning, our other guests are usually on their screens\"  This beautiful\
  \ compliment triggered something inside of me, something that reminds me how much\
  \ I want a family of my own. \n\nAs my rent-a-guardian week in Paris came to a close,\
  \  my wandering nature couldn't help but imagine what life would be like to have\
  \ a husband and child of my own.  At this point in my life, I know I should be focused\
  \ solely on myself, my goals and having fun\u200A\u2014\u200Awhich, of course, means\
  \ ignoring the deafening pangs of motherhood.\n \nJade left Paris believing that\
  \ anything is possible. And I returned hopeful that soon I may disrobe the given\
  \ identity of \"the traveler\" and prepare for a more grounded life."
