Text: "I didn't expect at first that i would be standing there in front of everyone\
  \ to talk about how my life is. \n\nTaking in another breath, telling myself to\
  \ not be nervous knowing all the audience sitting there to hear me out.\n\nI have\
  \ a vague memory  about how I ended up here. I only remember saying yes to the teacher.\
  \ Now that I'm here, there's no turning back. \n\n\" Good afternoon, ladies and\
  \ gentlemen! Today I, Arvlyn, take honour to give all of you a talk about self-arrogance\
  \ and self -confidence. \", said I. Wearing a smile, trying to not look nervous\
  \ as hard as possible are certainly a thing you wouldn't like to try. But, this\
  \ day, I had to. \n\nAs I continued my speech until the very end, I got a standing\
  \ ovation from the whole audience. I bowed and smiled brightly as I walk in the\
  \ back stage. \n\nTime had passed much as the competitors started to become very\
  \ few. It was closed to the end, I know. A loud standing applause was given to a\
  \ rival of mine. Her speech was incredible. Not being pessimistic but, I admit that\
  \ I may lose to her. \n\nThe competition ended up nicely and winner would be announced\
  \ in a few hours. \n\nI waited for quite a while before they started to ask us to\
  \ gather again. \n\n\" The winner is Ms. Wigleas! \", said the judges. I sigh as\
  \ I feel a pang on my chest. Well, who wouldn't be disappointed if the prize is\
  \ getting to study to London for free! \n\nI know blaming myself of losing results\
  \ to nothing. I almost walked out from the big hall when I heard one of the judges\
  \ said,\n\" There's this one competitor, attracts our attention very much. So, we\
  \ decided to give her a very good chance to go as the second representative student\
  \ from Indonesia! \", said the judge. I turn my head back and almost cry out of\
  \ joy when I hear my name is called! \n\nThe poster did say that only one person\
  \ got this chance! To think that I am lucky enough to be given another chance, I\
  \ am in joy for this day to come! \n\nI stand on the stage looking all happy and\
  \ proud with red eyes, holding back my tears. Giving out a 'thank you' speech as\
  \ I choke on my tears letting out  my shaking voice.\n\nI am indeed very thankful\
  \ for everything I get today, London is a really dreamy place to study in. \n\n\
  London, here I come, please wait for me!"
