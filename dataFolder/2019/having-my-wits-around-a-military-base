Text: "With the words \"ghost town\"echoing in my mind, I got on the bus that would\
  \ take us to Milovice, 38 kilometres from Prague. Needless to say, I didn't know\
  \ what to except. There wasn't much information available on the internet. But as\
  \ we approached the destination, I could see buildings that had a strong past but\
  \ no future. We finally got off near the airfield. One could see the different tanks,\
  \ helicopters and barracks that the landscape was peppered with.\n\nBefore getting\
  \ off the bus, we were warned regarding the dangers of taking the BVP ride in the\
  \ marshy area next to the tankodrom. People with back problems were asked to not\
  \ to venture near the tank ride for their own safety. We saw people disembark from\
  \ the tanks with injuries on their hands and feet. Being an adrenaline junkie, I\
  \ didn't care about the risks, I was all in for the ride. \n\nThere was a man sitting\
  \ in front of the tank and there were five rows in total with horizontal bars to\
  \ hold onto. One had to lower themselves into the rows and  then stand holding the\
  \ bar in front of them. Maybe standing was not the best idea but well, who was judging\
  \ anyway? I steadied myself for the ride that lay ahead while people kept coming\
  \ in. The guy sitting at the front of the tank with his fatigues on yelled,\"How's\
  \ the josh?\" And the automatic response from our side was,\" High Sir\". No wonder\
  \ dialogues from Bollywood movies were well known across the globe.\n\nAnd then\
  \ it started.. And lasted for a duration of fifteen minutes. It felt like the tank\
  \ was falling into the depths of the earth and resurfacing again and again with\
  \ all on board. It was both a nightmare and a delight. The adrenaline rush was a\
  \ hundred times more than I have ever experienced on a roller coaster ride and the\
  \ likes. We were being flung to the sides, to the front , to the back. In about\
  \ two minutes, I gave up trying to control my body. The bar I was holding onto was\
  \ not providing me much comfort either. To top it all off, a man kept sitting on\
  \ my hand, unable to balance himself whilst trying to safeguard his wife from falling\
  \ . With each fall and rise, I felt my body both tighten and relax at the same time.\
  \ It felt  as if I was a rag doll. I could not feel the floor anymore and the horizon\
  \ kept going zig-zag in front of my eyes.  \n\nAs the  minutes passed,I no longer\
  \ cared that my jacket had slid off a shoulder or that my left thumb was starting\
  \ to feel numb or that I had a continuous churning feeling in my stomach.  When\
  \ the tank dove again down the undulating land for the last time, I felt the man\
  \ sit again on my left hand and my thumb being twisted in an awkward way. Closing\
  \ my eyes and not letting go of the bar, I offered a silent prayer and steeled myself\
  \ against the final few minutes that lay ahead. When the ride came to an end, I\
  \ could no longer feel any tension in my body. My body was as relaxed as a puddle\
  \ and my senses were heightened. But one look at my clotted left thumb brought me\
  \ back to the harsh reality that life is. With my limbs barely working, i got off\
  \ the tank and went to put my left hand under cold water in the washroom.\n\nTo\
  \ say the water was cold would be wrong, it was ice  and i felt it bring a certain\
  \ warm tingling feeling back to my thumb. As I looked up,  I caught my reflection\
  \ grinning hard on the mirror. There were people with mud stains on their jackets\
  \ and overcoats, some groaning due to their injuries. But everyone had one thing\
  \ to say- nothing replaced the thrill of getting a ride in a tank on a marshy land.\
  \ It is one of the rides one ought to take in the long ride of life!"
