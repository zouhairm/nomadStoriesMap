Text: "This stories was about my first time travelling went to abroad. In 2017, I\u2019\
  ve got new job also new journey. I was requested to become representatives from\
  \ my company to come to finance workshop in Budapest. Of course it\u2019s also my\
  \ first trip to Europe. I was so nervous because of too much worries in my head.\
  \ One of that was difficulties of finding halal-food. As a moslem that living in\
  \ Indonesia, finding halal-food was not an issue but maybe it will be different\
  \ situation in another country, that\u2019s my assumption.  \nApproaching to checked-in\
  \ time, my colleague asking if I already made a request for special meals menu in\
  \ the plane. At that moment, I realized. I\u2019m in trouble now. My colleague was\
  \ a Christian and he felt so sorry because of forgotten to reminder me, well that\u2019\
  s not his faults obviously. In the lounge, I decided to bought some breads and chips\
  \ to anticipate the possibility there\u2019re not halal-food on the airplane. Fortunately\
  \ I\u2019m typically didn\u2019t like to eat too much.    \nMy flight was started\
  \ at late night. When the breakfast time, I\u2019ve tried to asking the flight attendants\
  \ if they\u2019re served halal food or not. At least I tried to asking, I thought.\
  \ She was asking to me if I already made a special request for halal-food in their\
  \ official website. Then I said I didn\u2019t made any request, so it\u2019s no\
  \ problem if I couldn\u2019t get my breakfast. After about 10 minutes, another flight\
  \ attendant came to me. From the uniforms, I guess he is more senior than the one\
  \ before.He tried to make sure if there\u2019s some mistakes in their system but\
  \ once again I told everything was alright. I was surprised because he offered me\
  \ some foods for replacing the main menu, such as breads, fruits, cookies, and some\
  \ juices. I really appreciate their concerned for giving best services about halal-food.\
  \       \nMy exploration continued when I was transit in Fankfurt Airport for hours.\
  \ Because we wil be waiting for about 5 hours, so we decided to stayed at lounge\
  \ and looking for some lunch. My colleagues suggested us to give it try for sandwich\
  \ shop, wish that they have halal-food or at least I can eat breads. Liked I did\
  \ before, I asked the shopkeeper if there\u2019re menu for halal-food. At first,\
  \ I could tell her expression was little bit surprised but the next second it\u2019\
  s my turned to become more surprised by her explanation. With full of passionate,\
  \ she explained that actually they has some variations menu of chicken sandwich\
  \ but she couldn\u2019t guaranteed for the cooking process and other ingredients.\
  \ The point is whole process already in accordance with halal standards. The explanation\
  \ made me silence in serious stated.      \nSame experienced I get in Budapest when\
  \ I was looking for some snacks. Near my hotel, there was a convenience stores.\
  \ When the shopkeeper was busy tidied up in food corner, I tried to asking about\
  \ the halal one. He seemed little bit confused so I tried to make it simple, likes\
  \ \u2018no pork\u2019, \u2018no alchohol\u2019, \u2018no blood\u2019. I still could\
  \ see clearly perplexity in his face. One thing for sure, I was moved by his effort.\
  \ Although he didn\u2019t fully understand about halal-food, he gave me some options\
  \ for food and mostly vegan food. As bonus, he also gave me a bottle of milk for\
  \ free and said \u201CYou have to eat as much as you can in this country\u201D.\
  \ I was speechless, at this rate I can felt his kindness.\nHonestly it\u2019s beyond\
  \ my expectation. This journey teached me something I have been forgot. That was\
  \ nothing difficult if we tried, at least we did the best and don\u2019t forget\
  \ for being grateful with all of the help that we have got."
