Text: "Kavyanjali Kaushik\nFebruary 26, 2019\n\n'Making a local connection' and 'I\
  \ didn't expect to find'\n\u2014Lagos, Nigeria\n\nTheir names are Salma (peaceful),\
  \ Afrah (happiness), Jamal (beauty), Dina (love) and others I can't grasp because\
  \ I am only half listening. There are about 10-15 of them around me, more joining\
  \ in quickly, their disabled limbs flowing on the ground as naturally as any healthy\
  \ ones, habitual of the disease they are crippled by. I am thinking of ways to keep\
  \ them focused on me because I am not sure if they will pay attention now. The main\
  \ distribution party has just left after waiting for an hour for our group to arrive.\n\
  \nWe were supposed to have reached the Oko Baba Resettlement Centre for the Destitute\
  \ in downtown Lagos, but were instead lost because some of the optimists of the\
  \ group thought Google Maps can navigate the ghetto streets of Ebute-Metta. This\
  \ area of the former capital is home to the poor, unemployed and lower income Muslim\
  \ families. The streets are hardly even visible to the naked eye now, crumbling\
  \ under the shanties made of plastic sheets and hole in the wall grocery-cum-public\
  \ telephone shops. Hawkers push around stale fruits and cheap hair extensions on\
  \ carts, avoiding yawning potholes and people who are young, old and everyone in\
  \ between, hanging around, waiting for opportunities. Google Maps had nothing.\n\
  \nWe arrived like a clown who comes late to a birthday party, a delayed surprise\
  \ nonetheless that excited the children. My pink shirt and bright blue, silk scarf\
  \ my mother had sent from thousands of kilometres away from India announced my arrival.\
  \ Since I don't live in Nigeria, I am not a regular visitor of this orphanage home.\
  \ I am also not a demographic the residents of the home are used to and that is\
  \ getting the attention of the growing number of children around me.\n\nThey are\
  \ touching my arms and hair, hypnotised, I am shamefully aware, of the straightened\
  \ hair, and sunscreened brown arms. The blue silk stole is going around as another\
  \ headgear for the Muslim girls wearing hijabs. \"What is your favourite song?\"\
  \ I ask, and they reply by singing, \"H...A...P...P...Y! Happy! We..are..happpppy!\"\
  \n\nThat was not the song I expected. Oka Baba Destitute Centre is home to handicapped\
  \ orphans from Nigeria, and sometimes neighbouring Benin. But divided into three\
  \ sections\u2013one each for lepers, blinds and other disabilities\u2013this dilapidating\
  \ state-run home often sees orphaned children mature into young adults and houses\
  \ some adults. Blind mothers and elderlies on wheelchairs with their limbs severely\
  \ disfigured from leprosy are looking at the newly-arrived volunteers, waiting for\
  \ more donations.\n\nOne of the young boys, his height too short for his age, is\
  \ tugging at my husband's jeans, who is busy handing out fruits. Water, the boy\
  \ asks, to wash the fruit before I eat? I feel strangely proud of the educational\
  \ inheritance that the boy has received and retained. Where the young adults and\
  \ adults come to riot-like fights over who gets the most share of the donations,\
  \ the boy's sensitivity to hygiene and patience is like a ray of sunshine in this\
  \ bleak place. In fact, basic health and hygiene products are most in demand here,\
  \ Pampers and soap bars topping the list.\n\nI am sharing stories from my school\
  \ days with the children, who laugh at my mediocre mathematics skills. One of the\
  \ emirs (rulers, literally, or, in this case, the caretakers of the children) tells\
  \ me they all receive middle school education but after that, they have no future.\
  \ Once the emir is out of earshot, I tell them to focus on mathematics and science,\
  \ and not on the Quran.\n\nIt's time to leave and Salma grabs my hand. She wants\
  \ to say something but isn't able to. She looks up, deep in my eyes, tears rolling\
  \ over a smiling, reassuring face because I am too touched and chocked to say goodbye.\
  \ As I travel back home, I search for the few names I remember and I pray that one\
  \ day the owners of these names are able to understand and live their true meanings."
