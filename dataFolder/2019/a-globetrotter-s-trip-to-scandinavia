Text: "Norway had always been a country that fascinated me by its aesthetics, but\
  \ now that I have been there, it seems grossly underappreciated. \nI entered through\
  \ Oslo, where I reached by an overnight Flixbus ride from Copenhagen. The Oslo-Bergen\
  \ train ride was so mindblowing that I was left wondering how heavenly the world\
  \ renowned Flam railways would be. The true thrill commenced once all the snow sightings\
  \ started when the railway tracks went uphill into the mountainous regions, and\
  \ all I could do was look in awe and exhaust my DSLR's battery.\nThe road from Bergen\
  \ train station to the Hurtigruten cruise terminal took about an hour on foot, from\
  \ where I embarked on the most remarkable voyage of my life. Being a marine engineer\
  \ by profession, my sailing has taken me to fifty three nations till date, but no\
  \ cruise was as spectacular as this MS Finnmarken voyage. The hospitality, quality\
  \ of accommodation,  taste and variety of food, entertainment and atop all, the\
  \ punctuality was astounding. Moreover, it wasn't only me; all my co-passengers\
  \ seemed to be equally taken aback by the vessel. The shore excursions were very\
  \ adventurous, especially the ones at Bodo and Trondheim. The icing on the top of\
  \ the cake was waiting though, for as soon as we crossed the Arctic circle, we sighted\
  \ the Aurora Borealis. Yes, we sighted the Northern lights in all the glory, dancing\
  \ across the horizon in shades of green and blue, with intermittent white and pink\
  \ colours as well. This had such a stupefying effect on all of us that we almost\
  \ missed our dinner that night. Not that anybody bothered, though - who cares for\
  \ food when you are having an experience of a lifetime? Not to boast here, but I\
  \ was the first individual on the Observation Deck to catch a glimpse of the Aurora\
  \ that evening. What started seemingly as a whitish patch of cloud ahead of us gradually\
  \ transformed into the glorious display of one of Mother Nature's most beautiful\
  \ creations. I was very thankful that I took an online tutorial about how to photograph\
  \ this phenomenon. That night, I slept so peacefully, having checked off a very\
  \ unlikely item from my bucket list, that I almost overslept and was about to miss\
  \ my destination, Tromso.\nTo be frank, Tromso, the Northern  lights capital, was\
  \ one of my two back up plans for sighting the Aurora, as it was well above the\
  \ Arctic circle, and has been frequently heard of sightings from within the city\
  \ itself. Fortunately, it didn't disappoint. A city full of ice in December, with\
  \ sub-zero temperatures near the North Pole and six months of darkness-only a crazy\
  \ tourist would select that, some of my well wishers said. Well, my eccentricities\
  \ paid off, and I still have my screen saver of Tromso with the \"Green Lady\" at\
  \ the backdrop.\nFinally came the third and last back up plan, in case I could not\
  \ see the lights, like numerous disappointed individuals before me. I had pre-booked\
  \ a Northern Lights chasing tour by bus with a professional agency, who take you\
  \ outside the boundaries of the city to nullify the effects of light pollution.\
  \ I could not believe my luck when this plan succeeded too, and even the tour operators\
  \ and the guides admitted that they had seldom seen a better display of the Aurora.\
  \ The ambience was absolutely magical, with stunned silence and pitch darkness surrounding\
  \ you in a sea of ice and an overhead gigantism of shimmering lights. It's in times\
  \ like these that you feel truly thankful for your life, and miss the people you\
  \ love most in this world, hoping in vain that they would be by your side to experience\
  \ this wonder.\nLike all good things, this too, had to end, and after staying in\
  \ Tromso for three days, and spending the most remarkable week of my life in Norway,\
  \ I had to board the return flight with a heavy heart but happiest memories, only\
  \ hoping to have the chance to revisit and re-experience all of it once more."
