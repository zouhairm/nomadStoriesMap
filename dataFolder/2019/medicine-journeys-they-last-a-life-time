Text: "In a time forgotten we are awakening to our ancestors who gained knowledge,\
  \ insight, wisdom's from our fellow earth dwellers. The plants, tree's, roots, barks\
  \ and seeds benefited mankind and still remain in hundreds of thousands of medications\
  \ today.\nMany bound in bondage encapsulated in the dreaded gelatin capsule. Talc,\
  \ heavy metals, artificial colourants. You can research medications containing parabens,\
  \ dead bugs alongside many types of acids like acetic acid. The list goes on..\n\
  \nDare we explore side effects- if you read the pamphlet that is.. You know where\
  \ I am going with this...\n\n Previously we relied  on the medicine cabinet of the\
  \ earth,  how little we remember and how so much is forgotten, as they package and\
  \ prep the pills designed for modern society. Many people are in the grip of sickness,\
  \ this is growing at a rapid rate, western medicine is no longer acceptable as a\
  \ band aid. The tourniquet tightens, the medical system is exposed, there is no\
  \ denying many of us have benefited man and beast saving lives, easing symptoms.\
  \ We are going to delve into the fact there are still a great deal of people dealing\
  \ with the back lash of side effects that comes with overzealous distribution of\
  \ prescription drugs. A multi billion financial institution.  \n\nWhat if you could\
  \ cure yourself? \n My quest is just this, adventuring through jungles, into desserts,\
  \ across lands & oceans into mystical places only those desperate dare to tread.\
  \  \nPicture this, you are struggling with pain, mobility and told you have an hereditary\
  \ health condition that is degenerative as well as incurable. The world as you know\
  \ it falls apart, you take drugs, from a doctor or from the street in the form of\
  \ self medication. You strive to stay on top of your game, although inside your\
  \ body is crying out, crying out for something more, to re-connect with nature.\
  \ \n\nIn 2012 my world changed when I was diagnosed with Hereditary sensory and\
  \ motor neuropathy CMT as it is also known as. Now lucky for me I have one of those\
  \ conditions that is at this present time rarely shown on the outside, I can hide\
  \ away until a flare up passes, The flipside is, there is always a flipside right?\
  \  People cannot see the struggle that goes on, within. Not one to wear my heart\
  \ on my sleeve I decided on the spur of the moment to enter into this competition.\
  \ This writing is done in the now, I have not written this previously although started\
  \ writing a book at 21 on an ecotopian world,  at 43 it is still a work in progress.\
  \ When I travel it gets written,  creativity floods though me, when I get home I\
  \ lose the ability to focus on writing. \n\nIn 2013 I sued the British Medical System\
  \ known as the  NHS they fixed my bones back wrongly ( they did correct this procedure)\
  \ with the funds I gained  I decided to travel to assist in my healing journey.\
  \ First I went to Ireland to visit friends, on the boat I thought if I can get to\
  \ Ireland I can get to India. In India another epiphany as I am being pounded with\
  \ a papoose of herbs in muslin, if I can get to India I can get to the Amazon. So...\
  \ that is what I did.\n\nIn my previous life I was a practitioner of holistic health,\
  \ living in the New Forest bringing up my only son. When he was 8 years old I sold\
  \ everything I owned and we took off to Australia & New Zealand. Through my holistic\
  \ work I gained a scholarship to America. I took my son on a 7 state road trip across\
  \ the USA. Blessed to have explored Bolivia, Morocco, and Europe. Travel and writing\
  \ have always gone hand in hand for me. Zero training, no workshops, blindly scribbling\
  \ what flows into my mind, My next journey is my first ever holiday ( as I have\
  \ only ever travelled) The sacred healing mineral pools of Tuscany my Mum is treating\
  \ me our first trip away together. I have always travelled for health, well being\
  \ and healing.  She has decided she would like to do the same -"
