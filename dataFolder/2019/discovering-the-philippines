Text: "One of the most intriguing places I have had the pleasure of visiting; the\
  \ Philippines is a tropical destination like no other. Crystal clear water, the\
  \ most stunning beaches on the planet and beautifully modest people make the Philippines\
  \ a must visit for anyone who wants to experience something unique, captivating\
  \ and adventurous. \n\nAlthough my experience as a foreigner visiting the Philippines\
  \ may be slightly skewed; I have a personal tour guide to show me the best and worst\
  \ that this country has to offer. My partner Carl is a Filipino, from Negros Oriental,\
  \ one of the 7,000 + islands of the Philippines. \n\nThe Filipinos come across as\
  \ shy people and are hesitant to speak to foreigners, fearing having to speak English.\
  \ Having a local travel partner that speaks one of the most widely spoken of the\
  \ 170 languages has greatly enhanced my experience, allowing me to meet extraordinary\
  \ people that I would never have had the joy of meeting and to have a truly authentic\
  \ experience. \n\nHaving previously traveled around Asia, I now have a different\
  \ perspective to the one I had when I first left South Africa at age 23 to explore\
  \ the picturesque beaches of Thailand.  Flying solo to a foreign land with no mobile\
  \ was one of the most exciting adventures I have ever had. Being lucky enough to\
  \ meet up with friends along the way, enjoying endless buckets and discovering what\
  \ were then undiscovered places was a trip I\u2019ll never forget. \n\nHowever,\
  \ I was young, and naive, my mind was solely focused on my enjoyment and nothing\
  \ else. I got a thrill from buying cheap clothes at MBK Shopping Center in Bangkok,\
  \ didn\u2019t notice all the litter left over from the full moon party in Ko Pha-ngan\
  \ and wasn\u2019t aware of the damage caused from the endless boats that have until\
  \ now wreaked havoc on the famous Maya Bay, the cove featured in \u201CThe Beach\u201D\
  , which is now closed indefinitely due to the negative impact that visitors have\
  \ had over the years.  \n\nThat was back in 2007; I\u2019m now 36 years old and\
  \ a bit wiser, more aware of the world and the impact that humans, including myself,\
  \ are having on the planet. We live in a world where our needs come first and everything\
  \ else comes second, or doesn\u2019t feature on the list at all. Whether we have\
  \ the choice to come first like we do in the developed world, or whether it\u2019\
  s just a case of survival for many others.  \n\nSo, how does this fit into my incredible\
  \ adventure to the Philippines? Well my eyes are open to the beauty of this captivating\
  \ place as well as the impact that development is having on this booming country.\
  \ \n\nThe economy as well as the population of the Philippines are growing at a\
  \ rapid rate, increasing the middle class and improving the quality of life around\
  \ the country. More people are rising out of poverty with greater financial stability,\
  \ increasing spending power and consumerism at the same time. This rapid development\
  \ is having a negative impact on the environment with industry taking zero responsibility\
  \ for the affect they\u2019re having, as well as the government struggling to get\
  \ a grip on it.\n\nDevelopment is a given in today\u2019s world, but it needs to\
  \ be managed and implemented well. \n\nThere are efforts to minimize the impact\
  \ and mindsets are slowly changing; with the recent clean-up of Manila Bay, these\
  \ steps are the first towards a greener future for the Philippines. However, I fear\
  \ that the damage will be too great to reverse if bigger steps aren\u2019t taken\
  \ now, with the most vulnerable people being affected by climate change and pollution,\
  \ as well as the pristine places I\u2019ve visited being changed forever.  \n\n\
  There is still hope. The Filipino\u2019s are a resilient, practical people who are\
  \ starting to prioritize their country\u2019s interests over the interests of external\
  \ influences. Along with many others, I\u2019ll keep a close eye on the development\
  \ of this country and do what I can to create a positive future for what is one\
  \ of the most fascinating places on earth. \n\nThe Philippines will remain close\
  \ to my heart; this journey is not yet complete."
