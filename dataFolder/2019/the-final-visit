Text: "The first thing I saw as I looked out the window was the snaking line of people\
  \ moving towards the common destination: the Parthi Saibaba ashram. The otherwise\
  \ empty roads were peppered with vehicles and people, everyone lamenting about the\
  \ loss of their spiritual leader, their Swami. \nThe last time we visited the ashram\
  \ in November 2010, there was a sense of jubilance in lieu of Swami\u2019s birthday.\
  \ The streets had bustled with devotees and pavements were lined with stalls selling\
  \ everything from fruits to flowers.\n\nNow, I was back in the Ashram on April 26th,\
  \ 2011; a day after Swami had passed away. This visit to ashram was to pay him my\
  \ final respects. It was preceded by a terrible argument with my husband H who advised\
  \ against it. He had argued that it would be difficult with large crowds that could\
  \ turn chaotic.\n\nAs I took a good long look at the line of people moving towards\
  \ the ashram located 4 kilometers away, I realized that his warning had some truth\
  \ to it. H came and stationed next to me; argument or no argument, I wasn\u2019\
  t traveling alone from Bangalore to the neighboring state to visit the ashram. \n\
  Since the influx of people had been anticipated, they had ringed off the ashram\
  \ peripheries. Vehicles weren\u2019t allowed and we had to walk under the hot April\
  \ sun. In spite of the looming sense of grief, people came forward to set up stalls\
  \ to serve water and food to the devotees. Those walking formed groups and shared\
  \ their favorite stories about Swami. The walk, the tears and the exhaustion had\
  \ melted the anger H and I had felt earlier towards one another. \n\nHowever, at\
  \ the beginning of the last kilometer towards ashram, men and women were separated\
  \ into lines and from then, things got a little trickier. As we entered the town,\
  \ the stalls were replaced with winding lines of people and groups of police on\
  \ the sidelines, ready if things got difficult. \n\nWe were jostled to move forward\
  \ and as we did, kept finding filled water bottles being tossed into the crowd from\
  \ houses nearby. This continued until the gates. \n\nOnce we reached the ashram,\
  \ We were all ushered in groups and allowed a quick view of Swami\u2019s body displayed\
  \ on the dais where he normally sat during bhajans. Once done, we were ushered out\
  \ as quickly as well.  \nI had stepped out of the ashram when I remembered that\
  \ I had promised to meet H at a specific point next to the ashram entrance. The\
  \ main streets were closed off and there was no way I\u2019d be able to inform H\
  \ about my location when our phones were still in the car. \n\nMy exhaustion and\
  \ grief were catching up to me and I was lost. When I explained my predicament,\
  \ a stranger voluntarily handed over his phone and I tried calling H with no success.\
  \ When I told another passerby about my predicament, he guided me through bi-lines\
  \ and side roads until we reached the main street. \n\nI saw H sitting patiently\
  \ on the opposite pavement of the street.  The relief that coursed through me when\
  \ I saw him was cathartic. I spoke to the young policeman about how I had to get\
  \ to my husband.  He asked me to slide in through the rope barricade when no one\
  \ was looking and move out quickly.   \nThere were blisters under my feet, my limbs\
  \ ached but there was a sense of closure and the remnants of that sense of relief\
  \ I had felt when I found H and we started back. \n\nSo right there, in the midst\
  \ of grief and chaos and uncertainty, I had seen how strong the kindness of strangers\
  \ who came together for a common purpose could be. I had seen how in spite of their\
  \ grief over Swami\u2019s demise and the uncertainty about their future, these people\
  \ who depended upon the ashram and the visitors to earn a living, played the best\
  \ hosts one could ask for. And I saw, how in spite of bickering, fights, and arguments,\
  \ H was my equivalent of an anchor, my support when the going got tough."
