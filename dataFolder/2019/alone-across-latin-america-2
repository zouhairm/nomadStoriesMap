Text: "I remember being nervous. Excited and nervous at the same time. My head could\
  \ not have stopped thinking what would happen. I was about to explore the unexplored\
  \ in the countries of the third world. The countries of Latin America. And all by\
  \ myself. Alone. Alone in this dangerous world. Dangerous as described in most media.\
  \ I was about to leave the zone of my comfortable life, my family, friends and begin\
  \ new chapter of my life. Chapter which was supposed to include many adventures,\
  \ crazy stories and unforgettable memories. I just didn\xB4t know what exactly would\
  \ happen. Therefore, I was nervous. And excited at the same time. I was also full\
  \ of hope. Hope for positive experience. Hope for finding my inner happiness. Finding\
  \ my destiny. I was about to make a step into the unknown world. World where its\
  \ culture had nothing in common with mine. World with no exact rules. World famous\
  \ for cocaine dealers and smuggling. These were the facts provided by news. I was\
  \ sure there must have been more. More of the kindness. Generosity. Friendliness.\
  \ That is why I made this step. I wanted to explore what was there. By myself. I\
  \ stopped trusting media, newspapers. I wanted to create my own opinion about Latin\
  \ American countries. That\xB4s why I took a leap into the unknown by myself. To\
  \ prove myself and others that the world is not such a dangerous place. That there\
  \ are more kind people than unkind. That there is more good than evil. I wanted\
  \ to show other women in the world that they don\xB4t have to be afraid of travelling\
  \ alone. I wanted to encourage other women to make a step forward. To stop being\
  \ worried. To stop fearing unknown. I wanted to inspire other people and show them\
  \ that everything is possible if you really want something. Desire something. You\
  \ simply need motivation. And courage. Something that is not easy to obtain. But\
  \ once you get it, you will be gifted for the rest of your life. It will be a gift\
  \ that will change your life. Your life priorities. Your dreams. Your dreams will\
  \ start coming true. You will start feeling alive. You will start to really live.\
  \ Courage. This is what you need to be truly happy. And this is what I needed for\
  \ stepping into the unknown. Unknown which became familiar after some time. Not\
  \ only familiar. It became my family. My way of life. My life priority. By exploring\
  \ of unexplored and getting to known unknown I changed the destiny of my life. Travelling\
  \ became my new priority. My addiction. My work. It became the inseparable part\
  \ of my life. It simply became me. And to learn that I needed to take a leap into\
  \ the unknown ..."
