Text: "It was My First time to come singapore and I am alone , on that time I was\
  \ 19 Years old but I'm not feel scared or  have Doubt to go there eventhough i don't\
  \ have anyone there, I only believe If we stay to be a good person we gonna meet\
  \ a good person as well , I just come there with my bravery, my english and map\
  \ .\n   Alright this story begin after a day I reach there I come to Sentosa Island\
  \ and I meet Someone there but he is not Singaporean when I am sit alone around\
  \ Universal studios , and we been talking in good way then i was think he is a good\
  \ guy , so I trust him , not take so long he ask my whatsapp number so I give him\
  \ my singapore number , then we talk on whatsapp after I back . In other day he\
  \ ask me may we go to Merlion and yes I say yes to him , what I'm thinking that\
  \ time if he is good and possitive, after we reach Merlion and we spend maybe 2\
  \ hours talking there we go to sentosa again then we go to Beach of sentosa , this\
  \ what makes me forgot the time , it's already 9 pm  in SG time , and yeah i ask\
  \ him to back but he said his friend want to come and meet me , And not take longer\
  \ His friends r come , 1 girl and 1 boy , I think possitive again cause have a girl\
  \ there . \nNext,  they ask me to follow them to go in other place and I just follow\
  \ but i was shock they come in to PUB that I'm never been there before I feel scared\
  \ to be honest but i didn't show them i pretend I ever been in pub as well , i ask\
  \ him to back cause it already 10.30 pm but he said wait after 5 min , I ask him\
  \ many time till the time become mid night 00.10 he always said 5 min, In this time\
  \ i think something wrong , but Suddenly someone come to him that he said he is\
  \ his friend from french. And they make excuse to talk , they said they want go\
  \ toilet but when i ask the girl wgere they go , she said they want to talk , in\
  \ this time I was thinking not synchron between them, after he talk he offer me\
  \ Orange juice like force to drink cause he knows i didnt drink Beer or alcohol\
  \ . I tell him i can't  because i have diabet And he said \"why u don't respect\
  \ us already buy for u\" and i said to him how much you buy I'm gonna return it\
  \ cause I  really can't  drink but he looks so bad and angry , in this time i feel\
  \ something weird but yeah I said to him I will drink after go toilet while i make\
  \ a booked for grab to go my hotel , then i Go out . On my way i text him thanks\
  \ for tonight I'm gonna back to Indoneisa tomorrow , after i reach hotel i tell\
  \ receptionist if someone ask what's my room number just don't tell or say If i\
  \ already move. Yes I'm safe cause we don't know what's in orange juice maybe something\
  \ bad cause in logic why they need to force while there's nothing. The point is\
  \ don't shows people u r scared  or the first it happen to u  ,Stay calm and think\
  \ possitive and think about trick for the people who try to trick you. \nIn other\
  \ case after 3 days i try to come malaysia as well from singapore by my self and\
  \ my guide is only map and google, and after i back from malaysia to singapore again\
  \ I back to Indonesia safe :). \nNb : why i don't order grab straight away before\
  \ cause i think he is good friend and possitive so just respect them . If something\
  \ make me feel danger like that of course im gonna try to safe my self ."
