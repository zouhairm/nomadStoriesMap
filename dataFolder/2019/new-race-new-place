Text: "Navigating my way down the rocky and heavily obstructed trail, with my legs\
  \ pumping and heart racing, perspiration began to drip into my eyes. I was half\
  \ way down this massive mountain when I came to a skidding halt. The warm afternoon\
  \ sun shone through the gleaming Curahuasi Valley, two hours west of the city of\
  \ Cusco, Peru. The world stood still for me in that moment, and all I could do was\
  \ observe the absolute majesty of the situation. This is the joy of leaping into\
  \ the unknown.\n\nThe first few days of my journey were spent wandering the streets\
  \ of Cusco on my own, then a friend said he could connect me with his Cusque\xF1\
  an amigo, Daniel. I contacted Daniel, and we toured the city a few days later. He\
  \ told me about a mountain bike competition happening the next day and asked if\
  \ I was interested in competing. I used to mountain bike in the foothills overlooking\
  \ Boise, Idaho, so I felt confident that I could hold my own on the trail. \n\n\
  After arriving in Curahuasi on Saturday afternoon, we drove up a meandering dirt\
  \ road that lead to the top of the soft green mountain. Saturday was the practice\
  \ trial and the next day was the competition. During the unloading process, Daniel\
  \ started swearing in Spanish. The pin that was supposed to keep his wheel securely\
  \ attached was missing. He said he must have dropped it back in Cusco when taking\
  \ his bike apart to load it. I insisted that Daniel ride the bike that I had rented\
  \ because, after all, riding in the competition was his idea. He wouldn\u2019t take\
  \ me up on my offer, but instead dressed me head to toe in his protective gear.\
  \ He wished me luck and sent me on my way, with a plan to meet at the bottom.\n\n\
  With dirty saliva and bloody socks, I rode through the small simple town looking\
  \ for Daniel. Making my way through packs of dogs that were chasing a small car\
  \ with a siren playing a political advertisement, oxen were wandering the street\
  \ and shoeless children playing futbol with a water jug. About forty-five minutes\
  \ had passed with attempting to familiarize myself with my surroundings when Daniel\
  \ pulled up behind me. \u201CWe thought you were dead\u201D he said. \u201CNope,\
  \ not dead!\u201D, was the only phrase I could muster through my exhaustion. He\
  \ asked if I would like to go again. \n\nWithin minutes I was in the back of a truck\
  \ speeding up that familiar dirt road. Yes, the ride was far more difficult than\
  \ anything I had tried in the past but I went for it. After all, when in Peru. .\
  \ .  \n\nMy second attempt, I started from higher up on the mountain than I had\
  \ the first time. I took a moment to watch the competitors ride the top half of\
  \ this ridiculous trail. Ninety percent of them were better than me and the ones\
  \ that were not were at least ten years younger. After the more experienced took\
  \ the leap of faith, it was my turn. I had everything to prove to myself. I began\
  \ pumping the pedals like never before, the wind roared through my helmet. I was\
  \ approaching the toughest section of the whole ride and I decided to be cautious.\
  \ It was at this moment that I slid to a standstill halfway up the mountain. The\
  \ air was warm and as the distinct scent of burning fields filled my nose, I felt\
  \ at peace. When I finished the ride and reconnected with Daniel, I told him that\
  \ I did not want to compete in the race tomorrow and he was happy to be a spectator\
  \ with me. \n\nThis experience exemplifies a leap into the unknown and epitomizes\
  \ why I love to travel without an itinerary. Sure, it can be scary and sometimes\
  \ simply dangerous, but putting yourself out there into the unknown is the best\
  \ way to grow, meet new people and experience culture you never knew existed."
