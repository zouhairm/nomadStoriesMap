  \ the right......\nThis world is too big and pretty beautiful in case if we search\
  \ for the beauty in it, but at the same time scary too. But it depends on us that\
  \ how we are looking for it\u2026the point of vision...That is the most important\
  \ thing if we search for happiness we will find it definitely, but if we search\
  \ for sadness we will also find it but may be Countless. Every picture has a different\
  \ view, and every face has a different story, just like each color has its own reflection.\
  \ Hi me tamana, and I want to share my travel story with you gays as I have not\
  \ travel allot but I am very interested in tourism, Especially the places which\
  \ are connected with the historical background Taj Mahal, The Pyramids at Giza,\
  \ Stonehenge, Colosseum and Forum, The Great Wall of China, Machu Picchu, mosques,\
  \ temples, museum but there are places which I love above all those places that\
  \ is the Seas, beaches, any area around the seas, have spirit to meet with new people,\
  \ and like to see new places.In year 2016 I travel to Karachi it was the season\
  \ of summer, where was I see lot of places but one of Which is the most pretty place\
  \ for me was the CVU side,I spend my whole day on CVU and enjoy a lot ride on camel\
  \ with my father. Take picture and collect lots of pretty seashells, eat tasty foods,\
  \ with the sound of ocean waves I experience a positive change in my heart, feel\
  \ relaxation with this nature sound feel so peaceful I love the sound of ocean waves\
  \ I love setting on the beach site and listening to the nature sounds around me,\
  \ nature relaxes me with its magic. The sounds of birds that I was listen just like\
  \ that the birds are singing and creating a song. But there was something I love\
  \ above all those things It was the peaceful quietness \u2026In such a big city\
  \ there wasn\u2019t the possibility of silence but there was a pretty peaceful quietness\
  \ on the beach, which I couldn\u2019t get ever in a big city, the sky looks beautiful\
  \ with clouds on the ocean of Karachi, This feeling all around me was beautiful\
  \ to me. That's why I love nature, This tour give me a lot, confidence, experience,\
  \ knowledge, best experience of environment, culture, language and I gain more confidence\
  \ and the main thing which I learned that is no need to be dependent on others it\
  \ my life and I should enjoy it."
