Text: "The lean figure pointed to the black sports bag he\u2019d tossed on the ground.\
  \ I crouched over the bag, the broken zip revealing a dozen worn-out ski gloves.\
  \ A little out of context, considering the closest ski run must have been thousands\
  \ of kilometres away. Yet, two Australians, relative strangers, also seemed a little\
  \ out of context in this part of Africa.\n\nThe walk here had taken us through carefully\
  \ tended plots of corn surrounding tiny shacks with warped corrugated iron roofs.\
  \ Beyond the plots the forest was the full spectrum of green, lush despite the dry\
  \ orange soil.\n\nWe trudged past a woman washing clothes in the stream at the top\
  \ of the valley and followed its meandering path down towards the meeting point.\
  \ We weren\u2019t sure exactly who would be meeting us. This was a day trip based\
  \ on a haphazard arrangement courtesy of our guest house owner, not unlike our arrangement\
  \ to come here, across the globe from where we first met. We were curious tourists\
  \ then, in a different hemisphere, on another continent, crossing paths for the\
  \ first time. Now the setting had changed, as had our relationship, but it was the\
  \ same curiosity about the world and each other that had drawn us here together.\
  \ \n\nThe local kids provided the soundtrack to our walk, singing \u201CHow are\
  \ you?\u201D from afar as we came within earshot. Further downstream we were greeted\
  \ by a tribe of them who flocked to have their photo taken. When they saw themselves\
  \ reflected in the screen, they erupted in fits of giggles. Their huge dark eyes\
  \ looked at us with a strange wonder, not unlike how I looked at him. They splashed\
  \ about, catching frogs in their tiny hands and shrieking with excitement.\n\nI\
  \ wasn\u2019t sure how we\u2019d know when we had reached the meeting point but\
  \ it was obvious. The ground dropped away and the water that had been our guide,\
  \ cascaded over the edge and into a dark pool a hundred metres below. I wished he\
  \ wouldn\u2019t go so close to the edge and was relieved when he came to sit under\
  \ the tree with me.\n\nIf nobody turned up I would have been content to sit, chat\
  \ and look out over the cliff into the bright green valley beyond. There was a lot\
  \ to learn about this stunning country and much more to learn about him. \n\nIt\
  \ seemed like almost no time passed at all before we were greeted by a group of\
  \ local men, tall and toned. They were a motley crew, some wearing basketball shorts\
  \ below the knee, most shirtless and barefoot. Why seven of them had come to help\
  \ just two of us, I wasn\u2019t sure. However, all but two promptly took a seat\
  \ and began to watch on as I was offered the optional safety gear, a well-worn maroon\
  \ bike helmet. I accepted but he waved it away. I was hoping the rope wouldn\u2019\
  t be optional too, and was relieved when our new friends began fastening carabiners\
  \ and rigging lines.\n\nMy right hand disappeared into the first grubby ski glove\
  \ and my index finger reappeared through a huge hole. I dug into the sports bag\
  \ for the mate to my fingerless glove but came out empty-handed, literally. I eventually\
  \ found a left, not a perfect match, but an apt fit for now.\n\nI would be the one\
  \ to go first, to once again put all my trust in a stranger in this far flung place.\
  \ The harness felt tight around my thighs as the rope was secured to the steel hook\
  \ which had been concreted into the cliff edge. I began to lean backwards and felt\
  \ the harness take my weight as the rope slipped between my gloves. With a quick\
  \ intake of breath, I braced myself for yet another leap into the unknown."
