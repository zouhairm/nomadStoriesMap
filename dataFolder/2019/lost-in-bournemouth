Text: "I went out on a school exchange to a little town in England called Bournemouth.\
  \ I have to say I\u2019m very bad at remembering places, and one day when we went\
  \ out to visit Stonehenge and came back very late on the afternoon, I couldn\u2019\
  t find my host family\u2019s house. All houses look alike, vintage bridge houses,\
  \ so I went to the bus stop and told the bus driver to take me to Castlemain Avenue,\
  \ that was all I could remember, I met some nice people at the bus, but nobody could\
  \ help me find the house of my host family. I remained lost after the bus stopped\
  \ and I ended up just waiting on the corner of the street for someone who might\
  \ knew my host family. Then, when I thought I would have to go sleep outside my\
  \ school, I found a man taking out his dog and I decided to ask him if he knew them,\
  \ that was my last chance and I did it. Good thing was he knew my host family and\
  \ he took me to their house, everyone was so worried and they even gave me a phone\
  \ so I could talk to them whenever I wanted. That was a really scary experience,\
  \ a Mexican exchange student lost in a little town in England. But I ended up loving\
  \ that little town, and discovering that getting lost is the best way to know a\
  \ place."
