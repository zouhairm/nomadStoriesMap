Text: "Well, everybody thinks that travel is a privilege, but many people do not have\
  \ the opportunity to go to the trip of their dreams. In July, I had this opportunity,\
  \ I traveled to the country which I dreamt every single night, a country which I\
  \ thought that only exist in TV series. However, I went there, I realized a dream.\
  \ I was born in Bel\xE9m do Par\xE1, a city in Brazil. I live in a outskirt called\
  \ PAAR, and I grew up listening \u2018\u2019you will never travel around the world,\
  \ because you are not rich\u2019\u2019. Hey, we don\xB4t need to be rich to go after\
  \ our dreams. We just need to believe in us, and I believed, so I went to Ireland\
  \ and others two countries, I saved money and I put in my mind \u2018\u2019 I\xB4\
  m ready to take a giant leap into the unknown\u2019. I took this leap and I could\
  \ know that Ireland is wonderful, everything is green, I was enchanted and realized.\
  \ I enjoyed every single day in this country, I cried, laughed, I had fun, I met\
  \ new people and I made a lot of friends. But, I could recognize that me as young\
  \ girl who always believe in me, can meet the world and show to everybody that we\
  \ are able to follow our dreams. I\xB4m from outskirt to world, and I  will encourage\
  \ people to travel and share their experiences."
