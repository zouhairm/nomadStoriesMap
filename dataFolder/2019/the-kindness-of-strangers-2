Text: "I had been sailing the Caribbean islands with my father for nearly 70 days\
  \ and had just convinced my mum to fly down from Canada to meet us in Martinique.\
  \ But by Wednesday, we were still in les Isles des Saints at the south of Guadeloupe\
  \ - two islands and 75 nautical miles north of her destination. \n\nThe weather\
  \ wasn\u2019t looking good, We would never make it in time. \n\nI needed a new plan.\
  \ So, I rowed and then walked into the quaint little town of Terre D\u2019Haut and\
  \ up to the tourist office. I used my rusty French to inquire about a ferry. \n\n\
  My only viable option meant leaving the following day. I booked it.\n\nThe next\
  \ morning, I hopped aboard the massive blue Catamaran and waved to my dad on the\
  \ ferry dock below. I began to wonder what was in store for me. I would be on an\
  \ island where I knew no one and had two days to kill. \n\nI couldn\u2019t have\
  \ been more excited. \n\nAfter only three hours we had reached Martinique - a journey\
  \ that would take my dad many days to complete. \n\nWhen I arrived in the town of\
  \ Saint Pierre, I was surrounded by crowds of people in the scorching afternoon\
  \ sun. \n\nAfter asking several locals, I realized I had overlooked something very\
  \ important. It was the 14th of July. Bastille Day. \n\nNone of the busses or taxis\
  \ were operating. Everything was closed.\n\nA man claiming to be a private taxi\
  \ offered to take me to a \u201Cchambre\u201D for 35 Euros a night, but my instincts\
  \ advised me otherwise. \n\nAfter walking for an amount of time I can\u2019t recollect\
  \ with accuracy, I spotted a van with the words \u201CFort De France\u201D on the\
  \ front, the capital of Martinique and the location of the airport. I managed to\
  \ stop the van to ask the driver for a ride. He confirmed my destination and opened\
  \ the passenger seat door. Would this be safe?\n\nGraciously, I hopped in. \n\n\
  The landscape slowly changed. The beaches and surf shops were replaced by industrial\
  \ stores, casinos, and tall buildings.\n\nWe tried three hotels, learning one after\
  \ another that they were closed, closed, closed. \n\nMy companions, who were comprised\
  \ of one big family, had made attempts to converse with me but I only understood\
  \ some of their words. Despite the language barrier, they seemed aware of my growing\
  \ concern. \n\nSuddenly, they began gesturing excitedly. \n\nI was convinced that\
  \ my French was failing me. It seemed they were inviting me to come stay in their\
  \ home! Sure enough, we left the \"big city\" for the country side, which I later\
  \ learned was called a small town called Vauclin.\n\nI was doing my best to commit\
  \ their names to memory and to learn how they were all related, but as we pulled\
  \ up to their house, my jaw dropped. Not only had I the good fortune of encountering\
  \ an incredibly kind family, but evidently, they were rich as well. \n\nTheir stunning,\
  \ two-story home had six bedrooms, three bathrooms, and an incredible kitchen and\
  \ lounge, connected by a balcony. Vines with bright coloured flowers weaved throughout\
  \ their patio and the exterior of the home. \n\nI felt like I had stepped into a\
  \ Wes Anderson movie set.\n\nThey prepared an incredible fish dinner, complete with\
  \ homemade ice cream, and rum. \n\nLater, I lay alert in their guest bed, taking\
  \ in my new surroundings. After months on the boat, I was extremely conscious of\
  \ the stillness. I realized how familiar I had become with every sound on the boat.\
  \ The dull rattling of the anchor chain, the creaks of the wooden floor boards,\
  \ the ocean. These sounds were replaced with new ones that night. \n\nFinally, I\
  \ fell asleep, practicing French verb conjugations in my mind. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ Denis and Nicole - the owners of the home - gave me coffee and chocolate croissants.\
  \ They offered to drive me to the airport the next day to meet my mum. With the\
  \ help of the Internet, I used an online translator to help me articulate just how\
  \ thankful I was for their unfathomable kindness. \n\nI will never stop looking\
  \ for ways to pay it forward."
