Text: "I could never imagine I would discover a whole new world inside my own country.\
  \ Yet, here I was, walking under the most beautiful starry night, on the dusty,\
  \ dark streets of a forgotten village in Maramures. The sky was so clear I could\
  \ almost see the Milky Way with the naked eye, giving me a feeling of warm infinity\
  \ and timelessness. I was happily discovering a gate to archaic Romania. Barefooted,\
  \ I made my way across the tiny streets, towards the wooden house I was going to\
  \ sleep in for the next five days.\n\nOnce I reached the old house's porch, I was\
  \ overcome with melancholy. This place, the village and its inhabitants made me\
  \ think of childhood and my grandparents. Wooden houses were surrounded by the smell\
  \ of freshly hearth-baked bread, while dogs barked afar off. Old women dressed in\
  \ traditional clothes were climbing the hill to the church, their hands filled with\
  \ candles lighting the night sky. The night service would soon start, bringing peace\
  \ and eternal quietness to the village. It felt like home in a way. But a long-forgotten\
  \ home. \n\nThen it struck me. My whole life I've been searching for a place to\
  \ start over, tho escape from the busy, noisy and stressful city life. Maybe this\
  \ was the place that my heart clicked with, the place where I would be truly happy.\
  \ I smiled at the thought and opened the porch, making my way inside the traditional\
  \ house. My path was clear to me now. I didn't expect to find a home in a village\
  \ with no electricity or tapped water. However, the warm feeling inside my stomach\
  \ suggested I did."
