Text: "Isfahan is an ancient city with a dry heart. The Zayanderud, by the time it\
  \ reaches the city, is dry, leaving gardens without seasonal flooding and the breathtaking\
  \ beauty of the Khaju Bridge with no river to cross. People gather there, underneath\
  \ the Khaju, drinking tea and singing songs of poetry, and the stones echo above\
  \ the cracked riverbed.\n\nArriving there, however, was less poetic.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve made it a habit not to sleep in transit. Even on long plane flights, I find it\
  \ discombobulating. The reality is that when I arrive somewhere, the first thing\
  \ I usually feel like doing is sleeping.\n\nFor me, waking up to the sounds and\
  \ smells and rhythms of a new place is one of the greatest joys of travel, feeling\
  \ the brush of exploration sweep across my mind, scattering the dust of yesterday.\n\
  \nBut I had fallen asleep on the night coach from Tehran.\n\nI was shaken awake\
  \ in my seat, in the stubborn grey of an early morning, by a woman of extraordinary\
  \ height. She had to stoop considerably to avoid hitting her head when she stood\
  \ up inside the bus. She wore no head covering, hot-pink lipstick, and a white,\
  \ loose-fitting top with pink piping. Her hair was dyed a desert blonde and her\
  \ huge sea green eyes towered over me.\n\n\u2018Your wife! Your wife!\u2019 the\
  \ woman said, one hand clasped on my shoulder, shaking me.\n\n\u2018My wife!\u2019\
  \ I said, and I looked at her in that special way that transcends language. The\
  \ way that says: please help me, I have no idea what\u2019s happening, I need your\
  \ help.\n\nI\u2019m not married, but sometimes when you\u2019re travelling, you\
  \ have to make concessions.\n\nWe were pulling out of a parking lot somewhere in\
  \ central Iran and she, my \u201Cwife\u201D, wasn\u2019t on the bus anymore. \u2018\
  My wife!\u2019 I shouted. \u2018My wife!\u2019 I shouted again, but the wheels on\
  \ the bus kept turning. The driver wasn\u2019t stopping.\n\nBleary confusion. Where\
  \ were we, and why was all her stuff still here on the seat? Backpack, camera, headphones,\
  \ chocolate. Scarf. Why had she gotten off the bus? How long had I been asleep for?\n\
  \nThe woman said \u2018Where? Where?\u2019\n\nI said \u2018I don\u2019t know, my\
  \ wife, I don\u2019t know!\u2019\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 she said, and turned and walked\
  \ towards the front of the bus. She leaned into her seat and spoke to the older\
  \ woman she was travelling with, who was also standing in the aisle, dressed in\
  \ a much more typical arrangement \u2013 black cha\u0304dor, from the ground to\
  \ the top of her head. The woman\u2019s mother, I guessed.\n\nI was running out\
  \ of time for a decision. Get off the bus or stay on the bus. Which was better?\n\
  \nBy this time, I was shouldering our two backpacks and clutching at everything\
  \ from the seats that I could hold between my arms. On, or off. On, or off. I looked\
  \ around at the people on the bus and out of the window for any signs, but it was\
  \ just sleepy silence and a stubborn morning haze.\n\nThe woman came back and handed\
  \ me a piece of paper. It said \"where you go?\" \n\nI said \u2018Isfahan\u2019\
  .\n\nShe said \u2018where Isfahan?\u2019\n\nI said \u2018Isfahan\u2019.\n\nShe said\
  \ \u2018okay, don\u2019t worry, okay,\u2019 and turned around to go back to the\
  \ front of the bus.\n\nI was worried. \u2018My wife!\u2019 I shouted again, but\
  \ the driver didn\u2019t stop. The woman was now talking with the driver. He seemed\
  \ unwilling, but she insisted, loudly, and the bus hissed and jerked. The driver\
  \ opened the door.\n\nI stayed put, having arrived by this time at the only real\
  \ conclusion. I was halfway between laughing and going back to sleep as my companion\
  \ tumbled up the bus stairs and into the aisle, out of breath.\n\n\u2018I had to\
  \ pee,\u2019 she said, sitting down. \u2018I was running after you, waving my arms\
  \ and everything, but you were already back on the road...\u2019\n\n\u2018My wife!\u2019\
  \ I said.\n\n\u2018Huh?\u2019\n\nThe bus rolled on for another hour or so. We would\
  \ find the reverberations of an ancient capital everywhere in Isfahan, in gardens,\
  \ under bridges, and in houses of God, but never more so than in the kindness of\
  \ strangers."
