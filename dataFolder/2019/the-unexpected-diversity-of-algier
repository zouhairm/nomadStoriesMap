Text: "I\u2019ve been in my twenties- loving an arabic  guy in my age, without any\
  \ permission of stay or work. He came as an refugee by boat to Europe three years\
  \ ago and lived with me since that time in Berlin. I already lived in my own flat\
  \ when I met him in the age of 18, I was young, curious, independent. But three\
  \ years later I was tired. No way for him to work legal without a marriage or a\
  \ baby.. So I did what I had to do. And there I was, married with 21, having an\
  \ husband and shaking the hand of his mother to introduce myself personally- in\
  \ Algier. \nCultureshock. I was nervous, would they accept me as an European girl\
  \ for him, without wearing an hijab? Would they accept that I never pray or believe\
  \ in Allah? I was skeptical.. We came out of the airport and there she was, waiting\
  \ for us to see her boy after five years and meet me. Happily his mom smiled and\
  \ then I felt the first warm hug from her. Hundreds of hugs from the rest of the\
  \ Family followed. I didn\u2019t understand a word but then the junger familymembers\
  \ started to speak English with me immediately. They were so thankful that I gave\
  \ them the possibility to see Hamza, my husband, again. It was a warm welcome in\
  \ an very hot country. An really very hot country. So we drove home by car. Entering\
  \ the house I recognized that four family\u2019s were living and sharing everything\
  \ together. Lots of noise, lots of trouble, lots of laugh. I became a part of them\
  \ super fast and we started to communicate with hands and feet. We cooked and spend\
  \ time together. After some days I became curious and wanted to see more of this\
  \ City and country, that I\u2019ve never heard about before. We took the car and\
  \ made several trips. As I recognized, they use the car there for everything, even\
  \ if they just go to the groceries store. Well, it\u2019s 3\u20AC to fill up on\
  \ the car, but anyway. \nFirst thing we made was going fishing. It was an one hour\
  \ trip to arrive at the sea, but it was one of the most chilled experiences to be\
  \ there. We did stay at the water, Sunset, next to us a tree with a bunch of goats\
  \ in it and an open fire to grill the fish on the other hand. Never ate an delicious\
  \ fish like that again! \nNext day we went to the mountains. It was a very hot day\
  \ with 40 degrees. On the way up we made a stop and saw little monkeys climbing\
  \ next to the streets. We gave them some fruits and they took it from our hands.\
  \ Even there I already recognized the climate change, it became more cold. But 30min\
  \ later I found myself in the snow, next to an snowgorilla with -5 degrees. Wow,\
  \ what an extreme difference. From the crowded city, to the beach, to the mountains\
  \ with snow. Everything is possible there. I loved exploring this city every day,\
  \ it stays exiting every day. \n\nBut I must admit, I enjoyed this travel at least\
  \ so much, because the people there are super lovely and happy. They are not what\
  \ you think of them when you believe the European media. They are funny, open minded\
  \ and proud. They love to laugh, about themselves and about others. And i felt two\
  \ big differences if I compare it with my life here: \n1. They work to live (the\
  \ less work, the more freetime, the more fun).\n2. We have the clock, they have\
  \ the time.\n\nThey have a very strong Family cohesive and treat their friends like\
  \ family as well. I became a part of them and they made me laugh more in one month,\
  \ then I ever did before. I enjoyed these people around me and it will not be my\
  \ last visit in this beautiful, arabic country. Next time I will visit the desert,\
  \ to tell you more about the background and original culture -and to ride the camel!"
