Text: "\u201CHow is it supposed that being isolated in a damp, mosquito-ridden jungle,\
  \ with great odds of facing a dangerous wild animal makes someone feel relaxed?\u201D\
  \ Asked my mom in a worried tone over the phone after I told her that I had decided\
  \ to take a trip to explore the Amazon.\n\nAfter a year away from home pursuing\
  \ a master\u2019s degree in Spain, I was longing to return to Brazil and rest for\
  \ days before leaping into my next journey. \n\nWeeks before my departure, some\
  \ friends commented on their desire to travel to Brazil and visit the famous Amazon\
  \ Rainforest. This intrigued me and made me reflect on the strange fact that the\
  \ largest tropical forest in the world is actually neglected by Brazilians as a\
  \ tourist destination.\n\nAfter lingering that though for days, I found myself stepping\
  \ in Brazilian soil, but far from the warm sandy beaches of my hometown Fortaleza.\
  \ I was in Manaus, the capital of the state of Amazonas, in the heart of the forest.\
  \ The one-week package included two days in Manaus and five days in a local indigenous\
  \ community, the Tukano-Dessana tribe.\n\nTo my surprise, in Manaus I came across\
  \ a typical Brazilian capital. High buildings and a peculiar urban center. The native\
  \ community within the forest, however, would prove to be everything I needed and\
  \ much more than I expected.\n\nAccess to the tribe was by boat only. We were a\
  \ group of eight tourists, coming from the most different parts of the world desiring\
  \ to unveil the mysteries of the unknown Amazon Forest.\n\nDuring the course of\
  \ two and a half hours, I had the opportunity to contemplate the greatness of nature\
  \ in its finest form. An immense river of dark waters reflecting sunbeams that dispersed\
  \ in a myriad of colors. Treading the path, dense woodland composed of majestic\
  \ species of tropical trees and flowers I had never seen before. Birds flying over,\
  \ the humid breeze rushing through my cheeks and the distant sound of nature in\
  \ a symphony.\n\nAs we finally disembark on the banks of Rio Negro, we were received\
  \ by the Paj\xE9 (leader of the community) under the Taba Grande, a large central\
  \ hut made of thick wood and palm leaves. All the tribe was waiting for us. They\
  \ had friendly expressions and the little ones looked at us with curiosity. Wearing\
  \ garments made of fabrics embroidered with straw, seeds, and feathers, they were\
  \ ready to celebrate! They performed a traditional Tukana-Dessana dance and fed\
  \ us with typical dishes. At nightfall, sleeping in straw hammocks was an easy task.\
  \ The fatigue was a great ally.\n\nDays would begin at dawn, and as they passed,\
  \ participating in the daily activities of the tribe brought us closer. Thanks to\
  \ that, I became friends with Raoni, who once during a fishery taught me something\
  \ precious. He said: \u201CFinding peace in an environment is not simply about being\
  \ present in it, you need to embrace it and belong to it\u201D. After some time,\
  \ I realized that being isolated was not exactly what I needed. In fact, coexisting\
  \ with the community and the wildlife was what made me feel relaxed and balanced.\n\
  \nDiversity is a big lesson in the forest, and now I see that I really needed this\
  \ learning. Living in perfect harmony with all species. Seeing the perfect relation\
  \ of all those creatures, millions of species living in a harmonious and interdependent\
  \ way, made me reflect a lot on the human race's potential to better understand,\
  \ to co-create and to relate in a much more prosperous manner.\n\nThe day of departure\
  \ arrived. Aboard, on the way back to Manaus, I got to, once again, contemplate\
  \ the beauty of wildlife. A sense of belonging filled me. Belonging to my cultural\
  \ and historical roots. Belonging to my home country. A group of endemic pink dolphins\
  \ followed us in the distance, gliding gracefully over the dark waters in this farewell.\
  \ That, for me, served as a validation for the transformation I had just undergone.\
  \ At that very moment, I felt I was part of the jungle and the jungle was part of\
  \ me. It was as if our hearts were beating at a single pace."
