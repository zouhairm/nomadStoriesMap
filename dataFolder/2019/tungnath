Text: "Travel isn\u2019t always pretty. It isn\u2019t always comfortable. Sometimes\
  \ it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that\u2019s okay. The journey changes\
  \ you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness,\
  \ on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave\
  \ something good behind.\nTungnath is one of the highest Shiva temples in the world\
  \ in Rudraprayag district, in the Indian state of Uttarakhand.\nThe journey is as\
  \ mesmerizing as the place itself. Other than being a religious destination, Tungnath\
  \ is also a well known trekking destination. The 5km trek starts from Chopta which\
  \ takes 3-4 hours reaching Chandrashila, summit of Tungnath which provides views\
  \ of the Himalayas, including Nandadevi, Trisul, Kedar Peak, Bandarpunch and Chaukhamba\
  \ peaks. Apart from all the scenic beauty and everglowing landscapes what we didn't\
  \ expect to find is the place has a great connections with the legends of Ramayana\
  \ and Mahabharata. This is the place where Lord Rama meditated after defeating the\
  \ demon-king Ravana. Another legend says that moon-god Chandra spent time here in\
  \ penance. This place has something for every person who dare to live the life they\
  \ dream of and it is always better to see something once than hear about it a thousand\
  \ times maybe you will find peace, a clearer picture of life or maybe enlightened."
