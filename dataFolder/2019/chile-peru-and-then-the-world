Text: "Ever since I was little girl, South America fascinated me. Not only were the\
  \ people, customs, and geography different than North America, they seem elevated.\
  \ My first chance to go abroad, I jumped at the chance to do an archaeology field\
  \ school in Peru and Chile. Easter Island was just a short (well, 5 hrs) flight\
  \ away from our hubs of Antofagasta, Cuzco, and Santiago. But, the roads that connect\
  \ what were the Incan Empire (1150-1493) were an extension of the cultural geography.\
  \  \n\nStretching almost 4,000 kilometers, the Incan state used roads to locate\
  \ their property, livestock, and moreover subjects. During one of his many travels\
  \ in the empire, Spanish chronicler Pedro de Cieza de Leon noted that in order to\
  \ \u201Ctrack what they have in such a great land, comprehend it by means of their\
  \ roads\u201D. In the more metaphysical sense, the roads are not only a means of\
  \ physical placement but an explanation for the relationship between space and peoples\
  \ in the minds of the Incas. And yet for many, my local guide Fabien, we are told\
  \ that even at Machu Picchu, Inca officials were rarely seen. \n\nRoads created\
  \ physical networks between polities (Cuzco) and villages translated into smaller\
  \ units of relationships based on exchange. This unique economic system makes up\
  \ this unique \u2018vertical economy\u2019. I got to experience these different\
  \ Andean ecological zones while changing altitudes and exploring sites. Semi-arid\
  \ to arid cities, including Arica, showed mummification that even pre-dates the\
  \ Egyptians (don't tell Tutankhamun) ! Each zone tended to be explored. Even in\
  \ less fertile areas, the death of emperors or lean times would result in ritualistic\
  \ sacrifices of children. \n\n\nIt was to the benefit of Inca officials to move\
  \ staple and prestige goods around the empire using the highway system. The state\
  \ had two major advantages; it could deal with problems and also reward loyal officials.\
  \ By following the oft described geoglyphs of the 'Nasca' lines, we see their designers\
  \ also tried to tell stories to one another. What makes the Nasca lines more exciting\
  \ is they be only be seen at an aerial distance. Their discovery in 1939 has not\
  \ entirely yielded a thorough explanation of what those lines, squares, birds, and\
  \ assorted iconography might mean.\n\n At Hu\xE1nuco Pampa archaeology site, residential\
  \ sites are interspersed by ceremonial and storage sites. It is a well thought out,\
  \ highly organized region that may have administered at least 5 ethnic groups. The\
  \ roads surrounding Hu\xE1nuco  Pampa provided a conduit for redistributing goods\
  \ and allowed localities with financial need to receive assistance. It was not uncommon\
  \ for maize and its related products to funnel around the realm, since it was a\
  \ crucial crop for subsistence and ritual use. Yet the Inca state chose to store\
  \ various types of goods in their storage facilities within Cuzco and along the\
  \ roads. Fabien noted that many local leaders of ethnic regions (known as kurakas\
  \ or caciques), were rewarded with exotic items like copper jewelry and gold ingots\
  \ for their loyalty to the state. It was not until the conquerors appeared that\
  \ the true price of wealth cost them their empire. Nevertheless, the Incan were\
  \ especially forward thinkers, and zooming along the Andean mountain, one catches\
  \ small glimpses of their ingenuity."
