Text: "My assumptions before I landed on this island were filled with snaps of high\
  \ maintenance locals (given the fact that huge number of tourists flock here every\
  \ year from around the world). The Andamans were a set of islands for colonial rulers\
  \ to spend leisure time while Indians were subjected to serve them or locked up\
  \ in Kala Pani.\nThe history books do not have much mention about the islands beyond\
  \ the torment stories of the prisoners. On reaching the infamous prison, which now\
  \ is a place for outsiders to visit for a specific period of any day, I stared into\
  \ the fire that was burning near the enterance in remembrance of those who suffered\
  \ for freedom. The yellow flame sent down a strange rage inside me (maybe because\
  \ of the history of the place I was taught when I was little). \nI went inside each\
  \ cell, touched the stone walls and the iron bars that may have absorbed thousands\
  \ of screams. The chill that ran down my spine was nothing compared to a friend\
  \ who witnessed his mate being flayed alive. I could hear my breath in the 4.5 *\
  \ 3 metres space inspite of hundreds of tourists buzzing in the complex. Seven wings\
  \ of 3 storied buildings- all connected at one central circular building for close\
  \ monitoring. There was a small staircase in the central building that was used\
  \ to keep an eye on the outside as well. I saw the Ross Island from that place.\
  \ Teal waters washing the beautiful red island could be seen from the place that\
  \ echoed horrors of what the walls witnessed. I came down the stairs and went to\
  \ another darker side of the complex. The place where prisoners were executed. I\
  \ hope they are in peace now that the country has what they gave they gave their\
  \ life for - Freedom!\nAs dawn set in, I wanted to leave the place as I could feel\
  \ lurking blood-curdling hushes in the air growing with the darkness of the day.\
  \ I stayed back for a short story that plays everyday in the evening as the voice\
  \ of a Peepal tree who could only be a helpless onlooker to this cursed place.\n\
  Leaving the complex reminded me of the puny complications we have been complaining\
  \ all our life. Blood of thousands of my countrymen cost us the freedom to even\
  \ complain or even compliment our life. \nIs this what payers would have expected?"
