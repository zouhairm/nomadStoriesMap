Text: "My life was shattered into millions of pieces 2 years ago. In the wake of my\
  \ destruction, I chose to start rebuilding myself back together piece by piece;\
  \ and many of the pieces are scattered across the globe in places I have yet to\
  \ go. I chose to start traveling when I can, to pick up my pieces and to also help\
  \ make the world itself a better place; through traveling with good intentions by\
  \ fulfilling service and humanitarian work. I have discovered that as I serve others\
  \ I heal a piece of myself in the process as well. \nOne recent experience I had\
  \ was when I was traveling alone in Lisbon. By the end of the day my feet were aching\
  \ form the miles I traversed all around the city, seeing everything I could in just\
  \ one day there. I was heading back towards my AirBnB and found this incredibly\
  \ steep staircase that I knew I could get a beautiful picture of the city from above\
  \ at the top. Step by step I began m way up, and about halfway up I noticed an elderly\
  \ homeless woman sitting on a landing in the middle of the heavily trafficked stairs.\
  \ \nWhat broke my heart was that no one else really noticed her, and some were tripping\
  \ over her or even stepping right on her. I wanted to do something for her, and\
  \ all I could think was to give my last Euros (which was about 15 EU in total.)\
  \ Walking up and making eye contact with her I said, \"Hola,\" and held out the\
  \ money to her. More than the money, I wanted her to know that someone cared for\
  \ her and someone recognized her as a human being; as a sister struggling who just\
  \ maybe needed to be reassured that she could make it through whatever she was going\
  \ through. She fluidly responded in Portuguese to me, which I didn't understand\
  \ the words but I could understand the feeling in my heart which was gratitude.\
  \ \nThe next morning I was leaving the beautiful city of Lisbon and heading back\
  \ to New York. I was running a little late so I was quickly making my way to the\
  \ Metro station to head to the airport. I was stopped at the gate to enter the Metro\
  \ when I realized in horror that my Metro card was empty from the day before. Panicking\
  \ in the moment, glancing at the impossibly long line to go stand in to re-apply\
  \ funds to my card, I was so worried I was going to be late and miss my plane! \n\
  I am a 100% believer in good energy and karma, and that day the universe rewarded\
  \ my kindness from the night before with a paid forward act of generosity towards\
  \ me. A kind gentleman standing behind me must have recognized my panic in that\
  \ moment, and he stepped forward and swiped his card for me to walk through to the\
  \ trains. \"Go ahead, go catch your train,\" he said in English with a smile. I\
  \ started to cry and could only manage out an \"Obrigada,\" before I turned on my\
  \ heels and ran to catch the train. \nI fell in love with the beautiful landscapes\
  \ of Portugal, the incredible details of the buildings and the architecture, and\
  \ let's not forget to mention the deliciously amazing food! But the thing I came\
  \ away with feeling the most grateful for was that I had experienced the kindness\
  \ of the hearts of the Portuguese people. I only helped one woman on the street,\
  \ but I was inspired to continue to extend my kindness and my service when I can\
  \ as I was rewarded the next day by another act of kindness towards me on the Metro.\
  \ \nKindness will always cultivate more kindness, and that is how I want to continue\
  \ to travel under as a mantra. I want to travel to find my lost pieces, to rebuild\
  \ my heart and fill in those gaps and holes with kindness, love, and compassion\
  \ for everyone I come in contact with around the world."
