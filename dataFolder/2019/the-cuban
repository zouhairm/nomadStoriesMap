Text: "I had heard many things about Cuba, but the phrase \"Be careful\" was very\
  \ recurrent among the travellers who asked them recommendations before traveling.\
  \ How Much? I wondered if I was accustomed to the busy life of my hometown, Mexico.\
  \ So with all and despite the opinions, take my backpack and I ventured to the beautiful\
  \ Cuba. It was a journey relatively quickly and at the time of depressing the airport\
  \ of Jos\xE9 Mart\xED, time stopped. It was as if I went back in time.\nEverything\
  \ was old and picturesque, a classic. With every Cuban who we spoke to us with love\
  \ and with force at the same time. Havana was old too, it was sepia. Walking from\
  \ here to there, covering me from the rain or the sun, depending on the mood of\
  \ the climate. And in one of the days I was discovering Old Havana and by then it\
  \ each Cuban I identified as \"Mexico\", appeared to me a Cuban woman very thin.\
  \ \"My girl, you are in Mexico?\" She asked with an air of anxiety. I told her yes\
  \ and she responded that he loved the Mexicans  to be caring individuals. That familiar\
  \ phrase made me think immediately in a deception. I knew it was as well, as he\
  \ spoke with that fluidity and power of conviction, made me feel empathy. How many\
  \ things don't have private Cuban, how many places you have not known, how many\
  \ things are hidden right before your eyes, I understand your anger.\nWhile she\
  \ dragged me by the city to buy her a little milk, for their children that surrounded\
  \ us, I saw in them the few opportunities they could have. Oh! Small Cubans that\
  \ they will achieve great things if they see beyond the eyes they have, beyond what\
  \ his mother taught today. Pay for your groceries and they thanked me with a genuine\
  \ love. Yes for me was love, a love that will make me go back and see converted\
  \ to all those people in great human beings"
