Text: "In 2004, the battle scars of war raged over this tiny Indian Ocean island.\
  \ Caught in a bloody civil war, besieged by class-system of hatred, Sri Lanka was\
  \ already walking among ghosts when in December 2004, nature would preside over\
  \ an Armageddon unlike any other throughout history.\n\nToday, Hikkaduwa is a sleepy\
  \ town that straddles the rugged South-East coast of Sri Lanka. To many that pass\
  \ through here today, the waves are what call them. But in 2004, the lives of thousands\
  \ were claimed by the strength of the sea. Today, all that remains of this once\
  \ bustling town are husks of brittle brick, shards of shredded timber, and tall\
  \ lanky strands of overgrown weeds. \n\nA Japanese memorial pays tributes to the\
  \ lives lost, but nothing can you prepare you for what follows after. A small tin\
  \ home, to the naked eye, just another easily admissible trait of what once lived,\
  \ but inside houses an intimate tale. One that defines the shear manifestation of\
  \ fear. Greeted by a humble yet warm human being, a former nurse who's life would\
  \ be forever defined by those events.\n\nAfter the devastation which ensued, this\
  \ incredibly woman began a remarkable path to create this homage to the event. What\
  \ first started as a tin shed out the back of her suburban home, soon began to trickle,\
  \ then flood with photos and memorabilia of that horrible event. Her story, is like\
  \ one of many, but her recollection is like no other.\n\nAs the first wave lapped\
  \ the shores, and then proceeded to disembark towards the horizon, a plethora of\
  \ locals gathered on the shoreline to take advantage of this strange event. It was\
  \ an animated depiction of what would befall them just a few minutes later as the\
  \ sea became acres of sand.\n\nOur heroine sensed that something was wrong, the\
  \ pathway to destruction lay ahead. She gathered her family, a few possessions,\
  \ and hit the ground running as fast as she could into the interior, through the\
  \ lush tropical jungle, and with not a moment to think or hesitate.\n\nMoments later,\
  \ a wave of 10 meter (30 feet) high champagne bubbles through itself into Hikkaduwa.\
  \ It caressed the houses, like matchsticks they gave way to the force of the ocean.\
  \ It uprooted trees, and it tore a passenger train passing through on its way to\
  \ Colombo from the rail tracks, killing hundreds instantly unable to escape the\
  \ intensity of the waves.\n\nWhat remained thereafter was a melange of debris, sand\
  \ and salty seawater. Decayed corpses floated, while others spread across the earth\
  \ with torn limbs and bloodied souls. Silence ensued. \n\nYears later, this homage\
  \ to the devastation tells a tale like no other. Photos adorn the walls, black and\
  \ white,  and colored memories of the day that darkness rode into town. Debris,\
  \ and death. \n\nNewspaper clippings, donated to reveal the days after this devastation.\
  \ As my eyes caress the wall of horror, her story siphons my ears with its raw and\
  \ emotive power. A sadness tinges her eyes, and I am verging towards tears. The\
  \ quivering of her lips as she recalls the pain of absconding into the hills on\
  \ that day resonates, as if I recall my own terrifying memory.\n\nHer story is one\
  \ of many, but what makes her genuine is the way in which she wants to tell her\
  \ story. Through local donations, and the willingness to open her home to strangers.\
  \ This is a reminder of the brutality of our current climate and of the savagery\
  \ of climate change. It's a story that embraces the meekness of our species, while\
  \ endearing with the strength of storytelling.\n\nAs her museum grew, space became\
  \ sparse, as we made our way through the soft tufts of grass that serenaded her\
  \ lawn, we discover another ode to this travesty. A wall enshrined with colorful\
  \ children's pictures. Images of sadness, loss, and of hope. These were the victims\
  \ of the atrocity - orphaned children, to which Sri Lanka witnessed more than its\
  \ fair share. \n\nAs we take our last few steps, and my eyes gather their last few\
  \ momentos. It's in these few seconds, that we comprehend the impact of this woman's\
  \ legacy. We are grateful."
