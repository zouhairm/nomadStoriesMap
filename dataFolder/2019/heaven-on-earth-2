Text: "Ganges is the longest river in India and it also has a holy significance. It\
  \ originates from a glacier - Gangotri. Our tourist guide guided us to a icy landscape\
  \ and stated that this was the glacier. The beauty was seriously amazing. After\
  \ clicking some pictures, I went to drink hot tea. The shop owner asked me if I\
  \ really wanted to see Gangotri. I was firstly confused but then slowly realised\
  \ that the actual place of the birth of the river was 500 meters away. He said if\
  \ I was ready to risk my life to see something really magnificent and me, being\
  \ a person of curiosity, said yes instantly. However, I was a little worried when\
  \ he said about risking our lives, not about my life but the life of the people\
  \ who trusted me and came with me on this trip. The people were excited too and\
  \ after some time, they said yes. I along with my group of 8 people followed him.\
  \ The path was narrow of about 1 meter only. He told us to make pairs of two. He\
  \ then ordered us that only when he says, we had to run as fast as possible for\
  \ 50 meters and do not stop in between. I then realised that huge ice rocks were\
  \ falling from above us of almost 1 metre diameter. He was observing the noise that\
  \ the rocks made while falling down and thus calculating the time in which they\
  \ would fall. When my turn came, he blew the whistle and I ran as fast as I could.\
  \ As I was passing a point, the rock would fall just behind me. I then realised\
  \ of what a great accuracy the guy had. I was breathing heavily and after everyone\
  \ came to this side, the guy guided us to for another 300 m and then what I saw\
  \ was the most spectacular thing that god created. It felt like I was born for this\
  \ day! The only sound you can hear was the water running and you know that it\u2019\
  s the most peaceful place you\u2019ll ever be. For some time I didn\u2019t even\
  \ blink and then I closed my eyes and found a slight taste of what inner peace would\
  \ feel like. I wanted to take in as much as I could.\nThe cool breeze ran a chill\
  \ in my spine. The sound of running water was the most melodious music I\u2019ve\
  \ ever heard. Above us was clear blue sky and below were the clouds. You couldn\u2019\
  t see anything below. We could see several moutain peaks. It was like pointy glaciers\
  \ floating above the white sea. All I wished for was the time to stop. I thought\
  \ if I\u2019d said no, what a spectacular view I would miss. While returning, I\
  \ didn\u2019t care even if I died as I thought my sole purpose of living was fulfilled.\
  \ The frequency of the icy rocks falling was much less than before and we reached\
  \ to the starting point safely. I thanked the guy for showing us what heaven on\
  \ earth looks like. It\u2019s been 5 years since I\u2019ve visited the glacier but\
  \ it still feels like yesterday. The mere sight of the awestruck beauty of the glacier\
  \ brought so much peace to me, that I changed to a more happy and peaceful person\
  \ in life. People don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re missing. I wish to tell\
  \ the whole world that if you wish to go to heaven, visit Gangotri because it\u2019\
  s really heaven on Earth."
