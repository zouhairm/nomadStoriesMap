Text: "Landed\u2026 first time in Kenya, first time on the African continent. My head\
  \ is wired with excitement but also with all the things I have read, all the things\
  \ I was told and all the things I want to see and experience. I am due to travel\
  \ for 3 weeks around this amazing country.\n     My good Kenyan friend, whom I met\
  \ in Europe during studies, came to pick me up from the airport with a warm, welcoming\
  \ and icebreaking advice: expect the unexpected, let your heart understand what\
  \ your mind can not and let your senses be amazed. When you want to understand a\
  \ country, get close to the core of its culture, one must travel not only in the\
  \ \u201Ctouristic areas\u201D but also in areas where people live their daily lives\
  \ far from the \u2026 tourist eye.\nSo, after enjoying a few days of what Nairobi\
  \ had the best to offer, we decided to take a bus to Kimilili, a town in the Western\
  \ province close to the Kenya-Uganda border. The region has made it as a trading\
  \ center for agriculture and services.\nThe road from Nairobi to Kimilili takes\
  \ almost 400 km and it is picturesque. The journey is taking you from the urban\
  \ hussle to quiet villages, to fields of vegetation,  fields of tea cultures and\
  \ if you are lucky enough you can spot along the road all kinds of animals which\
  \ will burst your wonder. The first thought after a couple of hours of travelling\
  \ is that I didn\u2019t expect Kenya to be so green and so vibrant. \n   From one\
  \ point of the journey we started to cross little villages or little towns and in\
  \ every one of them, from point to point a little building appeared with the word\
  \ \u201CHotel\u201D painted on the front. At first, I thought that maybe the area\
  \ which we were crossing is a kind of hub for the agricultural traders and services\
  \ providers and that so many little hotels are in order. But, while going further,\
  \ I saw many of these hotels along the road, more than in any city or area I had\
  \ travelled before. I looked around at the people on the roads and around these\
  \ buildings, they seemed to be locals not the hotel customer type. So I asked myself:\
  \ why area there so many hotels in an area with extremely little tourism? and who\
  \ owned them?\nWell, I thought to myself, maybe there are some cultural differences\
  \ which I still don\u2019t get and with this I returned to enjoying the journey.\
  \ But not for long.\nThe bus stopped all of a sudden, a wave of people\u2019s voices\
  \ from the bus emerged, everybody was looking out of the windows to see what had\
  \ happened and a after a few minutes of questioning we found out that a bus had\
  \ a flat tire.\nEverybody got out of the bus to wait for the driver to fix it. \
  \ While watching the efforts of fixing the bus, I told my Kenyan friend that if\
  \ they didn\u2019t fix it we would take a room to rest at one of those hotels I\
  \ saw along the road. With a little very surprised face he told me that in that\
  \ area you cannot find any accommodation because there are no hotels around. I thought\
  \ he must be joking with me:\u2019\u2019But what about all the hotels I saw on the\
  \ road?\u201D I asked describing to him the buildings I saw. \n\u201COh ,that ones\u201D\
  , he start laughing, \u201Cthose are a kind of pubs where locals go to take a drink\
  \ and eat something, but they like to call them hotels because they like the sound\
  \ of it.\u201D \nSo , the Hotel is not a Hotel in some villages, you won\u2019t\
  \ find any accommodation but maybe you will find some good chapati.\nWell. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find a hotel which is not a hotel!"
