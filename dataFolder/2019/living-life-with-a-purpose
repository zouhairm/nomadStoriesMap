Text: "These are the 3 P\u2019s I adopted as my way of living, that in Spanish stand\
  \ for \u201CPensamiento Positivo Permanente\u201D, or rather Permanent Positive\
  \ Thinking. The 1st two are quite common, or at least in these days, whilst maintaining\
  \ them in the long term, is quite a hazardous task. But lets at least try it\u2026\
  as the three stripe brand says, \u201CImpossible is Nothing\u201D\u2026 and neither\
  \ is being positive, permanently.\n\n\xBFWhy is it that when the glass is half full,\
  \ some just see it half empty\u2026?\n\nLife\u2019s constantly putting us in awkward,\
  \ undesired and difficult situations where we just have to choose how to proceed,\
  \ to follow the next path. Our next step is totally upon us, as is the attitude\
  \ we have when we take it.\n\nThose who know me can say I\u2019ve always had this\
  \ positive mindset, on top of just saying it, really feeling it inside me. How does\
  \ this work? I just focus and try to figure out what I would like to achieve, nothing\
  \ too greedy, never too shallow, just being grounded with small things that\u2019\
  ll slowly fill the glass\u2026It\u2019s about not fearing taking action and to make\
  \ mistakes in what you\u2019re desiring.\n\nConvincing yourself that by doing nothing\
  \ you have certainly nothing to achieve\u2026 so by just trying something, you\u2019\
  ll have more than nothing, and that\u2019s something. Definitely, what you feel\
  \ inside, it's worth trying it.\n\nI\u2019ve been listening and reading about the\
  \ power of the mind and how visualization makes things happen. And hell they happen.\n\
  \nIn my last months here in Melbourne, Australia I\u2019ve been having this dichotomy\
  \ of being consistent with what I truly believe and want, towards how I act upon\
  \ it. I recognise is not a simple thing to do, but indeed, it's worth trying it.\n\
  \nI believe that we transmit energy, at levels that perhaps are difficult to explain\
  \ or that science couldn\u2019t factically prove but assume it\u2019s inside ourselves,\
  \ in some way. This energy flows into the universe and comes back materialised in\
  \ things that we\u2019ve been desiring. How\u2019s that even possible? Why not just\
  \ believing that the universe has just good things prepared for us, and the \u201C\
  not so good ones\u201D happen to teach us things. So then they are not that bad\u2026\
  \n\nSo let\u2019s say that we could have the power of canalising and focusing our\
  \ energy on positive things we desire to happen. Why shouldn\u2019t we do it, daily\u2026\
  What are we afraid of? Don\u2019t we want good things to happen to ourselves and\
  \ loved ones? Obviously, we cannot control anything and that uncertainty makes us\
  \ anxious about not knowing what and when, and if things are really going to happen.\
  \ But what if we could just accept this and then embrace the uncertainty. Wouldn\u2019\
  t we feel a little bit lighter and don\u2019t carry this heavyweight. By just letting\
  \ the natural course of things flow, not thinking much when and how, but trusting\
  \ in the purpose of the Universe in making them happen.\n\nSo between these two\
  \ ways of seeing and transitioning thru life (Positive thinking and visualization)\
  \ I've wanted to meet and network with well minded and conscious people that care\
  \ for the environment. That's my goal, that's my Mojo! Welcome universe."
