Text: "Mario leads us to the entrance. My dusty blue sneakers maneuver the thick roots\
  \ and jagged stones of the mountains incline with ease. Always wear an agile pair\
  \ of shoes in Greece, where cobbled streets turn suddenly to natural terrain. We\
  \ have reached the archeological site of Kassope. \nMy fellow students and I have\
  \ spent the last few months training to perfect choral movement for a modern interpretation\
  \ of Sophocles\u2019 Antigone. Ancient Greek chorus\u2019 move in sync with one\
  \ another, as an almost homogenous entity. Recent days have been consumed by our\
  \ brutal attempt to sing the \u201COde to Man\u201D in its original Ancient Greek\
  \ while flowing as one. \nWe flock instantly from muscle memory as we enter, pouring\
  \ one after the other into the effortless V formation of birds, laughing openly\
  \ in the face of the stifling heat of Greece careening toward June. We have been\
  \ awarded a grant for our performance of the \u201COde to Man.\u201D I assumed people\
  \ who received grants exuded intellect in a constant stream, but here I was; an\
  \ average twenty-three-year-old woman, running through a site dated back to 400\
  \ BCE, screaming Ancient Greek to the overgrown weeds. \nThe town of Kassope is\
  \ built high on a mountain near the village of Kamarina. There is a panoramic view\
  \ of Greece at the edge of the site where a sudden drop is guarded by a short wooden\
  \ barrier. Soft hills and vibrant fields lead to where land gives itself to the\
  \ sea. It is not the glittering blue of the waters promised on travel pamphlets\
  \ alongside photos of Mykonos and Santorini. From this height it appears a stormy\
  \ grey mass, heaving dwelling place of a moody Poseidon. I have always been drawn\
  \ to beauty which coexists with melancholy. \nI turn my head to take in the loneliness\
  \ of a town abandoned. Wind creates a tunnel of electric sound in my ear as I glimpse\
  \ three stoic white figures standing tall at the top of a mountain in the distance.\
  \ Their bodies are unmistakably female. They resemble a shadow cast on the ground.\
  \ My heart slows. \n\u201CMario, who are they?\u201D I ask. \n\u201CThey are the\
  \ women of Souli,\u201D he says. \nHe tells me their story. \n\u201CThe people of\
  \ Souli protected their home in the mountain for a long time during the Ottoman\
  \ Domination. They were fierce fighters with a deep and unmatched knowledge of the\
  \ land, but they were forced to flee as Turkish soldiers invaded. There was no escape,\
  \ and the women of Souli knew brutal enslavement awaited. They ran to the top of\
  \ the mountain Zalongo with their children. They gathered and held hands, slowly\
  \ beginning to sway and dance together. It is rumoured they sang this song: \n\u2018\
  A fish does not live on land\nNeither blossoms on the beach\nAnd the woman of Souli\
  \ cannot live \nWithout freedom.\u2019\nThey were born free, and so they would die\
  \ free. They threw their children from the top of the mountain, and then one by\
  \ one they followed.\u201D \nThe chorus of the \u201COde to Man\u201D begins with\
  \ the line \"polla ta deina.\" I have come to understand its meaning as this: there\
  \ are many wonderful/terrible things in the world, but none more wonderful/terrible\
  \ than man. \"Deina\" has the simultaneous connotation of both wonderful and terrible.\
  \ The short phrase conveys that humanity can be both completely wonderful and completely\
  \ terrible in the same moment, in the same word. I whisper it to the strong shadow\
  \ women before me. \nThe folk song for the women of Souli has an upbeat tempo, the\
  \ sounds of bells and drums pumping energy into the body. Mario explains that it\
  \ is typical of songs from this region to blend lyrics describing an all-encompassing\
  \ sorrow with a euphoric thrumming. We dance our hearts out, Mario explains, so\
  \ that the pain leaves our bodies. A refusal to be destroyed. The show must go on,\
  \ and in its wonder and horror I ache at the beauty."
