Text: "It was my last day in Chefchaouen and the woman who worked at my hostel offered\
  \ to take me out for a drink that night. In this charmingly blue city, although\
  \ she was born and bred in Morocco, she had only been living in Chefchaouen for\
  \ a month. As we set off, she had the brilliant idea of taking me on a tour through\
  \ the medina. Naively I said yes - blissfully ignorant to the fact that we were\
  \ now lost in the maze of the old city\u2019s many small alleyways. The sun started\
  \ to dip further into the horizon; casting its warm shadows on the blue walls that\
  \ engulfed us as we ventured deeper and deeper into the heart of the medina. Suddenly,\
  \ we found ourselves being led aggressively by a small local man into the entrance\
  \ of a Moroccan rug store. \n\nThere we were met by a vibrant, cheerful man who\
  \ flirted incessantly with the both of us. He went through his products one by one,\
  \ starting off with the jars of herbs he had on the shelf behind him, and shamelessly\
  \ boasted about his hot girlfriend from Sydney, Australia. He told us what herbs\
  \ were great for increasing one\u2019s sex-drive (of course) and accidentally let\
  \ it slip that he also had a Moroccan wife and child. Naughty!\n\nHe had now begun\
  \ showcasing his collection of rugs for sale as Layla and I noticed the smell of\
  \ another familiar, and even naughtier, herb coming from the back room. He mentioned\
  \ that he had just smoked some hash and apologised cautiously. To my surprise, Layla\
  \ slowly pulled a joint from her bag and, suddenly, I found myself smoking hash\
  \ for the first time in a Moroccan rug store.\n\nNow high, we walked back into the\
  \ medina, found a classy restaurant and ordered ourselves a full bottle of red wine.\
  \ As we sat, drank and ate, I was instantly reminded of the film, Before Sunrise,\
  \ directed by Richard Linklater. \n\nJust like Jesse and Celine, we were two passing\
  \ travellers who decided to stroll through the streets of a foreign city together.\
  \ We talked, explored and found ourselves in the eye of a dangerously exciting whirlwind\
  \ of serendipity and deep connection. Layla and I talked for hours and hours, each\
  \ conversation a mirror where I was her, and she was me. We discussed monogamy,\
  \ religion, the meaning of life - everything under the sun! And the more we spoke\
  \ and unraveled about eachother, the more I saw myself in her. \n\nWe had the same\
  \ thoughts, views, and experiences while growing up - from mental health, to past\
  \ trauma, to even our personality types in the Myers Briggs test! She told me of\
  \ a tattoo that she\u2019s been wanting recently of the sun and the moon, mentioning\
  \ that she wanted the sun to look like a sunflower. I told her, \u201CWait til\u2019\
  \ you see what I\u2019ve got tattooed on my ribcage and right shoulder!\u201D\n\n\
  Sitting across from her at that dining table was the first time I didn\u2019t feel\
  \ out of place in this world. We understood eachother perfectly and connected not\
  \ just to eachother, but also to the life around us. \n\nNow that we were both high\
  \ and drunk, we made our way back to our hostel and sat on the rooftop. We were\
  \ welcomed by the greatest view of what felt like the entirety of Chefchaouen right\
  \ in front of us, and began kissing helplessly in the twilight. Never would I have\
  \ imagined that I would find love, though it be for just one night, in a country\
  \ where homosexuality was illegal. \n\nIn fear of getting caught, she took me to\
  \ her room and we made love, quietly, for SEVEN hours! \n\n...What can I say, it\
  \ must\u2019ve been all those \u201Cherbs\u201D from the rug store! \n\nWhen she\
  \ asked me to stay with her that night, I packed up my things, went back to my room,\
  \ slept for an hour and left for a different city the next morning. For us, our\
  \ Before Sunrise moment was never supposed to be a trilogy. Just like the sun and\
  \ moon, we were two people destined to meet eachother - but only for a short snippet\
  \ in time."
