Text: "Last year, I won a fund for apprenticeship for one month in London. When I\
  \ talked with my husband about this opportunity he was happy for me, but with days\
  \ he turns very angry and nervous, and I knew why. \nWe have three kids (10, 4 and\
  \ 1 year), and he felt that he could not with our three kids, I felt very nervous\
  \ and angry because he will be living in our home with family, friends and all facilities,\
  \ and I said I will carry on the kids, and we crossed the Atlantic direct to London\
  \ a flight of 16 hours that my kids incredibly supported it. When we were in the\
  \ London airport we felt lost, I don't know how to move in the city with bags, kids\
  \ and stroller (something that it is extremely important when you travel), but everything\
  \ happened well. By the next day we travel to Paris in a extremely cheap and comfortable\
  \ flight, when we arrived my kid knew where he was!, we walked a lot for the Paris\
  \ streets, visited de Louvre, and they could appreciate the sculptures, paintings,\
  \ and everything there, we walked a lot, and I carry my kids in the stroller all\
  \ the time possible, sometimes my arms hurts, but I feel vey happy to stayed there\
  \ that I did not care. Three days later we travel to Dublin, and we walked for a\
  \ lot of parks and feed the guises, ducks, birds and squirrels, visit the museums,\
  \ and we stayed in a hostel, but well, how I said I travel to London for apprenticeship,\
  \ and I need to return for there. \nWe lived in London for one month, during that\
  \ trip, all the weekends we walk over the London streets, visit all the free and\
  \ exciting museums of the city and we can feel the encourage of our relationship.\
  \ \nOf course that was a terrific trip, but at same time, I felt nervous and scary\
  \ for this adventure, I feel very happy to did it all this with my two kids and\
  \ the stroller, and now I know that we can do it again that it is hard and expensive\
  \ but not impossible, and that we learn like a family we will never forget it. Now\
  \ we are planning our next trip, Europe again,  a trip for 15 days seven country's\
  \ in Eurail, but now all family.  I feel more comfortable with this now and I\xB4\
  m pretty sure that this trip will be one of our more excitement travel in our lives,\
  \ and I feel more secure and confident to do it with our last experience . Travel\
  \ with kids it is possible."
