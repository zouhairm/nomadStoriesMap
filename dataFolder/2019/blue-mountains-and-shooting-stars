Text: "I grew up just at the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. During\
  \ the day, I spent my time staring up at these gigantic blue mountains. At age 16,\
  \ blue mountains were all I'd ever known. In the country, there\u2019s little to\
  \ do at night, besides staring at the wide array of stars above. This is how I normally\
  \ spent my Virginia nights. At age 16, I'd never seen a shooting star either.\n\
  However, in 2014, I saw a shooting star for the first time. It was one of those\
  \ rare nights, when I didn't have someone watching the stars with me. It was completely\
  \ silent. Nothing, but the sound of the wind rustling through the trees to keep\
  \ me company. Like most nights, I was hoping something exciting would happen, when\
  \ I watched a marvelous light zoom above me. Immediately, I shut my eyes. To this\
  \ day, I don't know who my ancestors were, or what runs through my blood, but that\
  \ didn't stop me from wishing to go someplace far away; some foreign lands that\
  \ my ancestors may have walked upon. \nMonths later, I got a letter from an organization\
  \ called People to People; founded by President Dwight Eisenhower, on September\
  \ 11th, 1956. People To People's purpose is \u201Cto enhance international understanding\
  \ and friendship through educational, cultural and humanitarian activities involving\
  \ the exchange of ideas and experiences directly among peoples of different countries\
  \ and diverse cultures.\u201D People to People had invited me to be a student ambassador\
  \ in Scotland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and England for a month. Before\
  \ that letter, I did not believe in wishes, but now I did.\nJuly 6th, 2015, I set\
  \ off for the United Kingdom. I\u2019d never been away from home in my life. I was\
  \ excited, nervous, and completely overwhelmed. I learned a lot unexpected things\
  \ that summer. \nIn Scotland, I visited my first castle. There, I saw the collection\
  \ of crown jewels in one of the many seemingly endless rooms. In the castle gift\
  \ shop, I picked up a book on the history of Scotland. While walking down the Royal\
  \ Mile, I took a picture of a building. Sometime later, I came to find that building\
  \ drawn in my book. \n      In Ireland, I met a lovely man named Noell. He owned\
  \ a bed and breakfast in Cahersiveen. This man opened his doors for me, fed me,\
  \ provided a place for me to sleep, and taught me how to play Gaelic football. Though,\
  \ my favorite time with Noell, was when he kept me company at breakfast, with stories\
  \ about his childhood. Not far from Noel\u2019s I visited a community center for\
  \ the local teenagers. While hanging out with them, I realized that these kids weren\u2019\
  t different than me, except for the fact that we\u2019d grown up in two different\
  \ countries.\nEngland had many opportunities. I met and listened to a lecture from\
  \ a former member of Parliament, whose name had long since vanished from my mind.\
  \ At Warwick Castle, I learned how to sword fight; how the knights did in the medieval\
  \ times. London provided the option to ride the London Eye. While on the Ferris\
  \ Wheel, it was like I could see the whole world around me; a never ending expansion\
  \ of buildings, waterways, and gigantic fields that looked like small meadows from\
  \ above.\n      Wales was a beauty. There, in Snowdonia, I saw my first ever mountain\
  \ that wasn\u2019t a melancholy blue. These puke green mountains, provided endless\
  \ sheep and no trees in sight. I spent my days in Wales hiking these mountains.\
  \ One day, a companion, Gary, noticed that I was much more adventures than the others.\
  \ He inquired upon this, and I was about to answer that home was small and I\u2019\
  d lived my life hoping for adventure. However, before I could speak, a thick mist\
  \ came rolling down the mountains. It was like something out of the movie \u201C\
  The Mist.\u201D We ran like our lives depended on it back to that Hostel. \n   \
  \   That summer was the best one of my life. I\u2019d experienced so many unforgettable\
  \ places and people. When I came home, I felt as if the world was mine to explore\
  \ and discover."
