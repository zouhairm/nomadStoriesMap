Text: "A trip is alway a chance to see, to feel and to learn how diferent is the world\
  \ just flying a couple of hours from safe home.\n\nThis adventure started in M\xE9\
  rida, a city in the south of M\xE9xico in the peninsula of Yucatan, one of the richest\
  \ region in Mayan culture.\n\nTo arrive is easy there are several flights that connect\
  \ you with all the important cities of Mexico.\nAs soon we landed, the embrace of\
  \ a warm wind and the start of a new adventure rush invaded me.\n\nIs it an hotel\
  \ room important? Is it the transportation? Or is just the chance to walk in the\
  \ streets and to enjoy new places enough to get extraordinary memories from a trip?\
  \ For me a clean room with a comfortable bed is enough, but you can find multiple\
  \ options for your taste and budget.\n\nMy first impression walking in the city\
  \ was: this is a full of tourists city but in a comfortable way, you can see the\
  \ buildings and places without a billion of heads in the middle of your pictures\
  \ or endless lines in a museum.\nThere are a lot of options for eating, you can\
  \ find the best of typical food also several international style restaurants or\
  \ small places just in case you want a simple slice of pizza.\n\nThe city is a masterpiece\
  \ of architectural styles, the buildings are full of details, there is always a\
  \ house, a door even a complete street where suddenly i started imaging those past\
  \ times full of romance and people offering a smile at every step like they do now.\n\
  \nA walk around the plaza is better with a sorbet, just a few steps from catedral\
  \ you can find Helados Colon, founded in 1904, offers a variety of flavors from\
  \ the traditional vanilla or chocolat to extraordinary  mexican fruits.\n\nA drink\
  \ in bar is also a good way to end your day, enjoy a nice glass of wine in a bar,\
  \ a coktail or a beer in the places installed outdor throught the streets.\n\nThe\
  \ second day started in a magnificent restaurant called ''La chaya maya'' where\
  \ traditional mexican flavors,  a coffe with bread and fruits or mayan dishes are\
  \ served. Here the typical tortillas are prepared by hand in an open place that\
  \ give you the chance to see the process.\n\nPresidents from all over the world,\
  \ royalty members, artist and a lot of important visitors of Mexico always wear\
  \ the typical ''guayabera'' wich is a shirt made of linnen or cotton.  A walk around\
  \ the center of the city will bring you the chance to choose the best for you in\
  \ one of the many stores that you can visit.\n\nWomen can also find a huge variety\
  \ of clothes from this region with the exquisite work of a mexican piece, a plenty\
  \ of designs, bags, shoes, accesories and artcraft perfect for gifts or to decore\
  \ your home.\n\nThe next is to visit the catedral,  House of Montejo or one of \
  \ the several museums in this area. Art is also a must see, from pieces of antiche\
  \ collections to contemporary artists that will tell you the richess and variety\
  \ of mexican work.\n\nAt afternoom i suggest a nice walk on Paseo de Montalvo one\
  \ of the most important avenues that will show the luxurious way of living of the\
  \ founders of the city, most of them are now museums, hotels, restaurants and comfortables\
  \ bars.\n\nA must see in your trip is the grand museum of mayan world, the biggest\
  \ in Mexico dedicated to this important and interesting culture. This museum count\
  \ with modern installations where you can see pieces from diferents periods and\
  \ give you an idea of how magnificent was the mayan civilization.\n\nAlso from Merida\
  \ you can visit some of the most extraordinaries Mayan cities like Chichen Itza\
  \ , one of the marvels of the modern world,\nto visit a traditional factory of chocolat\
  \ or antiques haciendas and colonial cities.\n\nWill you like to swim in natural\
  \ under water systems called cenotes or to be in a pink sea?\n\nYes! A lifetime\
  \ experience, but that my friends is part of our next adventure.\nCome and join\
  \ me."
