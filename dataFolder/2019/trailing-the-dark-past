Text: "Ring....Ring..... the alarm on my phone went off, it's 5:00 a.m in the morning\
  \ 6th of February, the weather is cold outside, it's winter. Tossing around in bed\
  \ thinking \"Do i have to go this early?\", with one final sigh i got up and prepared\
  \ to face the journey ahead. Boarded the city bus and within few minutes i was at\
  \ Dworzec Autobusowy MDA station, i had purchased my bus ticket the night before\
  \ to avoid the long queue at the station. I was on the bus and headed to Oswiecim\
  \ which lies 60km west of Krakow, this little town became famous after the second\
  \ world war as a site for two of The Nazis concentration camp AUSCHWITZ and AUSCHWITZ\
  \ II- BIRKENAU, the drive to Oswiecim lasted an hour. \n\nStepping out of the warmth\
  \ in the bus into the cold and the snow on the floor, in front of me few meters\
  \ ahead was Auschwitz a place that draws almost 1.5 million visitors from all around\
  \ the world. Soon i was standing in front of a black gate leading to what will become\
  \ one of the most emotional and heart-breaking experience for me, the place where\
  \ one of history greatest atrocities were committed. Shortly after going through\
  \ security and collecting my entrance card, i was inside one of the largest concentration\
  \ camp of the second world war. This was the first location of the two concentration\
  \ camp in Oswiecim. Inside the huge compound stood a gate with the words \"ARBEIT\
  \ MACHT FREI\" meaning \"WORK SETS YOU FREE\", it's hard to miss this slogan as\
  \ it leads to the other part of the compound were there are 22 brick wall building\
  \ with poignant exhibitions and walls still holding unto the inscriptions of torture.\
  \ \n\nAs i walked through the yard and visited each building, i could only imagine\
  \ what the victims went through being held captive in a place they never wished\
  \ or considered to be home. The agony of standing out in the cold winters for hours\
  \ during roll-calls, starvation leading to severe weight loss and death, separation\
  \ of families, babies hauled out from their mother's hand whilst the mothers were\
  \ still clutching unto their babies, thousands lead to their death unaware, torment\
  \ and humiliation everyday. I felt the warm tears rolling down my cheeks and my\
  \ heart sinking into a void with a question WHY? HOW COULD THE WORLD WATCH WHILE\
  \ THIS HAPPENED?."
