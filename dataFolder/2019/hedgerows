Text: "\u201CAre you sure you know where we\u2019re going?\u201D\n\nMy husband looked\
  \ at me apprehensively as we set out from Bayeux, \u201Ccaf\xE9 \xE0 emporter\u201D\
  \ in hand and baguettes in my pack. The sun was just starting to gild the medieval\
  \ stone walls. \n\n\u201CI mean, I\u2019m pretty sure\u2026\u201D\n\nAfter three\
  \ days of monuments and cemeteries, I wanted to slow down and experience Normandy\
  \ like the Allied infantry did after the 1944 D-Day invasions. I convinced my husband\
  \ to trek through the countryside to the Longues sur Mer gun batteries on the coast.\
  \ There was just one problem \u2013 all of the hiking maps I could find were in\
  \ French and did not mark trails outside Bayeux\u2019s city limits. I was actually\
  \ only about 55% sure where we were going, but he didn\u2019t need to know that.\
  \ \n\nAn asphalt bike trail led away from the city \u2013 so far so good. We passed\
  \ misty swamps, sleepy stucco suburbs, bike commuters with laptop panniers, and\
  \ fields full of sugar beets. An hour in, the bike trail ended. Signs pointed us\
  \ to an unmarked path along a creek \u2013 I started confidently down the trail\
  \ and swigged the last of my coffee. \n\nThe path abruptly left the creek and darted\
  \ between two tall hedgerows. Before arriving in Normandy, I only vaguely knew what\
  \ a \u201Chedgerow\u201D was. Apparently the Allied forces didn\u2019t know much\
  \ more than I did when they invaded. The ancient network of dense, tall earthen\
  \ walls is a perfect defensive structure. Some historians say that underestimating\
  \ the French hedgerows was one of the greatest tactical errors made in World War\
  \ II. The Allies were forced to improvise hedgerow clearing attachments for tanks,\
  \ and infantry were reduced to grueling field-by-field guerrilla warfare against\
  \ mines and hidden machine guns. \n\nOur trail narrowed to a single file green canyon,\
  \ and the hedgerows rose to eight feet tall on either side of us. I couldn\u2019\
  t see anything to the right or the left, and trees closed in over our heads. There\
  \ were no more bike commuters or to-go coffees, just a tunnel of opaque foliage.\
  \ A machine gun could easily be hiding six feet away and we would be none the wiser.\
  \ \n\nThe tunnel spat us out on a narrow gravel road with no signs or people in\
  \ sight. Birds chirped at each other in the dappled oak trees, and cow bells clanged\
  \ in the distance. Trying to ignore my husband\u2019s skeptical looks, I pulled\
  \ out my phone to look up directions. Google Maps pointed down a grassy unmarked\
  \ lane.\n\n\u201CAre you sure this is right?\u201D\n\n\u201CI mean\u2026Google says\
  \ so\u2026\u201D \n\nAn hour later we came to a clearing and a little red hatchback\
  \ whizzed past the hedgerow on the far side of the field. D104 \u2013 the motor\
  \ route.\n\nBack on a paved road, large modern signs pointed towards Longues sur\
  \ Mer. Part of the road was closed due to hedgerow clipping \u2013 the workers had\
  \ a fascinating vertical mowing tractor. Closer to the village, friendly brown Norman\
  \ cows waggled their ears and batted long eyelashes as we walked past. Children\
  \ in tiny reflective vests chattered on their way to school, and a garbage truck\
  \ eased between ancient stone walls.\n\nPast the maze of winding village streets,\
  \ there is a dusty expanse of no man\u2019s land. Wind blows off the English Channel\
  \ full of salt and limestone. The last intact German gun batteries in Normandy stand\
  \ on two hundred foot tall cliffs, resolutely pointed out at the Channel. You can\
  \ climb down into the bunkers, and look through iron cannon sights. The concrete\
  \ is streaked from rain and pocked from the invasion, but otherwise solid. Hedgerows\
  \ heal and hide their scars - the batteries are stark and will not fade. \n\nAt\
  \ the edge of the cliff, guns at our backs, we sat down and unpacked our baguettes\
  \ and cheese. In the Channel below us, fishing boats bobbed on cerulean waves untainted\
  \ by blood. The shimmering bucolic quiet drowns out echoes of seventy four year\
  \ old artillery, and daisies peek out between chunks of limestone and concrete.\
  \ Our Camembert was gooey from the heat of the sun, and more delicious for it."
