Text: "Call me \u2018son of tears\u2019. I\u2019m a weeping wolf. Loss and adventure\
  \ is my twin. I started losing in installments. First to disappear from the scene\
  \ of my life was my sister .Death killed her at the petal of her age. I loved Naito\
  \ to death. No eclipse should go extinct when it the only guiding light in a sea\
  \ of night. Today the wandering scarlet swimming in my veins is freezed. \nThe strong\
  \ hand of death again saw it fit to grab my grandfather. The one who gave me home\
  \ when his son died in his arms. When I reached the age of reason I loved a girl\
  \ from the blue misty mountain in the East. Her name was Susana- I called Cinnamon\
  \ that lingers. Our hearts knotted so readily just like our fingers, but Susanna\
  \ too left. Susanna the last standing in my life receded away like a whisper in\
  \ windy sea. She said my obsession with adventure had become a clandestine.\nWhen\
  \ my dearest dears were all gone, I finally knew that my time to be alone had come.\
  \ I\u2019m alone in the world travelling through life wearing mourning black, traveling\
  \ with a pen which I love like a son, and from abundance of emptiness I have discovered\
  \ abundant paths  less traveled in the enormity of space.\nJanuary 2016 the journey\
  \ began. I heard hear the scuffle of my feet follow me to the sticks. A falcon hovering\
  \ above my head led me to \u2018Hell \u2018kitchen in Marafa\u2019, at the outskirts\
  \ of Malindi in the North coast of Kenya. \nHell\u2019s kitchen is a sandstone canyon\
  \ dressed in fierce color of flame, an ascent and descent of gullies dipped into\
  \ stygian silence. A \u2018city\u2019 of gorges twisting and curling up in obscure\
  \ shapes. \nA pathway curled and led me to the red floor of the valley. The jags\
  \ sprouted and their distorted shadows seemed like a society of mute giants.\nThere\
  \ wasn\u2019t much threaten me in the gullies except a snake shyly slithering to\
  \ a hideout or a terrified blue lizard holding its breath on the top of a rock.\n\
  As I crawled up, I saw a human frame sitting on a jagged reddish platform. He had\
  \ a mop of white hair. His gaze was fixated on the great fiery orange orb as it\
  \ gently sank into oblivion. His garment was odd, ashy theatric tatters in the pale\
  \ mauve. His collarbone looked quite like an arc. I greeted him and I was met by\
  \ rude silence. I greeted him again, five times and he turned .His eye sockets were\
  \ empty and fangs predatory.\nAmid the galloping of my heart, I retreated, stumbling\
  \ behind mammoth rocks. The ghost descended from the jagged rock. Its bones creaking.\
  \ He followed me; its frame like an old poorly taken photograph. \nIt burst into\
  \ eternal laughter, like steel iron sheets dragged over the jagged rocks. It brutally\
  \ creaked in my ears, and then stopped.\n\u2018Grandson, welcome to hell\u2019s\
  \ kitchen! \u2018\nThe voice was croaky like a forty-cigarettes a day chain smoker.\
  \ It sounded like my departed grandfather.\n\n I woke up shaking, I\u2019m not sure\
  \ if I was breathing. It was true dream!\n\nA myth is whispered that Marafa was\
  \ a city of bygone epoch, inhabited by Wakiza people. A city of rich and poor. The\
  \ rich prospered greedily, meanly and selfishly at its core while the poor languished\
  \ at the outskirts of man, while the poor were head and shoulder submerged into\
  \ poverty. This annoyed the gods and one day the central part started sank and all\
  \ the rich perished. The reddish color on the floor said to be the blood that sopped\
  \ the valley.\nAnother lore says that the villagers received a vision requiring\
  \ them to relocate. Everyone heeded except one elderly old woman who refused to\
  \ vacate The deserted village was supposedly gobbled up  into gluttonous belly of\
  \ the earth- with the lone woman still inside - leaving the canyon in its place.\n\
  \nHell\u2019s kitchen is one Kenya\u2019s hottest secrets. The name was provoked\
  \ by canyon\u2019s malevolent, roasting temperatures. \nNo tours are done during\
  \ the day as the temperatures reach 50 degrees"
