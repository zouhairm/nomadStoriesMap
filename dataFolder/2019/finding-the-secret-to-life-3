Text: "There has always been a mental clock for us all, when we should be married,\
  \ when we should own a home, have kids etc. What I have come to find is that everyone\
  \ is chasing this societal dream to have that average life. Everything is routine.\
  \ Why would I open my eyes in the morning and not want to see something different..\
  \ some culture, smell foods I\u2019ve never tried before, be out my comfort zone,\
  \ be an explorer. \n\nI was in a routine, to find that what was planned for me became\
  \ destroyed. Being in a relationship with someone at a young age for eight years\
  \ and then suddenly becoming single is such a tornado of thoughts. Life will do\
  \ that to you,constantly challenge you.\n\nI have found through traveling I am able\
  \ to redirect my thoughts, to become brave in a place so unfamiliar, to see how\
  \ people react to my type of personality, to adapt to culture is everything. \n\n\
  I\u2019ve seen Japan, London, Philippines, Paris, Thailand since I\u2019ve been\
  \ on my own as a single 28 year old woman. I\u2019ve stayed in hostels and made\
  \ friends abroad. I\u2019ve gotten lost only to find that I have found pleasure\
  \ in uncomfortable situations to learn how brave and strong I am. I have the ability\
  \ to crush language barrier through my amazing humor and people skills. I\u2019\
  m completely new, I\u2019m a version of all the places I\u2019ve been to. I will\
  \ continuously strive for seeing more and more the world. I want to learn the secret\
  \ to life. \n\nWhy would staying in a comfortable place make you grow ? Dreams die\
  \ in the comfort zone . Broadening your horizons and experience is everything."
