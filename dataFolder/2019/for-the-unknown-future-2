Text: unlike any other teenage girl, I spend my 17th birthday on the plane flying
  to Taiwan. Both of my parents insist I should go there and search for my future.
  I was so jealous since all of my friends celebrate their birthday having a party.
  I tried to open my mind while sitting next to the window plane thinking of what
  can I find there. After 7 hours of flight, I finally arrive. Even after that long
  flight, I still need to take another 2 and a half hours bus to Kaohsiung.  Finally,
  I started to accept my condition. Long story short, my mother and I planned to visit
  the university I am going to enrol in. As for my surprise, the campus is really
  far from the crowd and the surrounding area is far different from the one in the
  picture. The google maps say we need to hike by car for about 20 minutes, and we
  did it because we are curious. While we on our way we keep saying that it's not
  possible there's a campus up there since we surrounded by mountains and hills. Our
  mind went blank when we arrive at the top. It's exactly the same as the photos.
  There are two 5-star hotels, an amusement park, Large shopping malls filled with
  the high-end brand and there is a campus. I don't expect to see these kinds of sight
  on top of the mountain. Maybe we should never estimate or overlooking just by our
  thought. What I found there was priceless. A fusion of nature and European styles
  buildings, what can i ask for more?
