Text: "Mannuji was driving and humming to the tune of an old Hindi song that was playing\
  \ in the car stereo. I rolled down the window to surrender myself to the views straight\
  \ out of the pages of an age-old pastoral literature - dreamy villages, terraced\
  \ valleys, deodar forests, secret rhododendron trails, and swaying yellow mustard\
  \ fields.. \n\nIt was my second day at Dehradun, the hillside town in the Indian\
  \ state of Uttarakhand in the lap of Himalayas. The good-humored Mannuji was a local\
  \ guide and cab driver and we were on our way to Rishikesh. Known as the \u2018\
  Yoga capital of the world\u2019, this charming Himalayan town and its people have\
  \ a special otherworldly vibe about them. We witnessed the famous Ganga Aarti \u2013\
  \ a devotional ritual offering to Goddess Ganga- as the dusk descended. A huge statue\
  \ of Lord Shiva in the river overlooking the proceedings, the children of the Ashram\
  \ sang the bhajans in their sweet, haunting voices praising Lord Shiva and Goddess\
  \ Ganga. Surreal and overwhelming! \n\nMy Panasonic point-and-shoot digital camera\
  \ did quite a good job capturing the beauty of the region throughout the trip. Whenever\
  \ Mannuji came in the frame, I kept clicking and soon I realized that he started\
  \ enjoying the shutterbug attention! He liked them and asked if he could get prints\
  \ of those photographs. It was difficult to get it printed from a digital cam with\
  \ the limited time we had in hand. I promised him to send them over to him once\
  \ I get back home. I remember us sitting on a wooden bench in the Buddhist monastery\
  \ and my friend writing his address on a piece of paper and giving to me. I returned\
  \ home the next day. \n\nA year passed by after my trip to Dehradun and one morning\
  \ I woke up to the devastating news leaving me and millions of Indians in shock\
  \ and despair. The floods in Uttarakhand were declared one of India\u2019s worst\
  \ natural disasters. The landslides and heavy rainfall took around 6000 lives -\
  \ more than a 100,000 people evacuated, about 3, 00,000 tourists and pilgrims trapped\
  \ in the valley. The news footage was horrifying. Those towns and villages I walked\
  \ around are under water now. Those people who welcomed me with a warm smile are\
  \ now fighting for their life. I watched the huge Shiva statue halfway under water\
  \ in tremor and I saw Ganga at her fiercest, overflowing and taking away everything\
  \ in sight. The hymns of the children from the Ashram resonated in my ears. \n\n\
  I thought about Mannuji. I was scared and wasn\u2019t sure if I should call him.\
  \ The telephone and electricity lines were cut off in the region for days. I got\
  \ in touch with him after a week but I couldn\u2019t hear the usual warmth and vigor\
  \ in his voice. He had lost his land; his house was halfway under water and needed\
  \ to be revamped; his little daughter\u2019s school was washed away. He and his\
  \ family were evacuated and would go home in few days since the water level was\
  \ receding. We didn\u2019t speak much.\n\nWhen I called him again after 3 weeks,\
  \ Mannuji sounded hopeful. He was getting his house back in shape; his daughter\
  \ started going to classes in temporary buildings the locals had built. The man\
  \ and many men like him were rebuilding their lives in the mountains and they were\
  \ never going to give up. I felt proud. So proud of these people, humanity and its\
  \ spirit.  \n\nI went to the nearby studio next morning. It took me hardly 20 mins\
  \ to print a few photographs, put them in an envelope and mail it to the address\
  \ Mannuji had given me a year ago. As I was walking back home, all I could imagine\
  \ was this man far away on the mountain roads driving his car, humming those songs\
  \ and daring to dream again. I thought about him receiving the envelope and I was\
  \ sure those photographs would bring a smile on his face. And that was all I was\
  \ hoping for!"
