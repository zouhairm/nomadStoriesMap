Text: "It was like an epiphany.\nWhen you woke up after a long sleep...\nI was born\
  \ in Russia (Moscow) and only after a trip to Elbrus I\u2019ve realized how grateful\
  \ I am to be a citizen of such a powerful, beautiful and versatile country.\n\n\
  I\u2019m crazy about traveling. I\u2019ve visited enough countries to understand\
  \ this fact.\n\nBut the idea of the trip to Caucasus was clear for me: my friends\
  \ and I just wanted to escape from the daily routine and leave immediately as far\
  \ as it possible, and it didn\u2019t matter where to go...\n\nThe trip was unplanned\
  \ at all: we took the bus early in the morning and after that - 17 hours of long\
  \ and boring road on the way to cherished mountains...\n\nI saw them as they began\
  \ to appear out of the window: huge, incredible, inaccessible mountains covered\
  \ with the morning sun and brilliant snow. The first thought that appeared in my\
  \ head was about how lonely these mountains should be...\n\nWe got off the bus and\
  \ air - this air still haunts me because it\u2019s different, really cold and fresh\
  \ - started blowing in my face, but the sun, definitely warm and bright, was shining\
  \ and smiling to us. Like the hole Russia - a country full of contradictions, greeted\
  \ us with chilling wind and hot rays of the sun...\n\nThe unexpected fact of the\
  \ trip was not only the clash of paradoxes, but the way of local life: all people\
  \ live by one day - in Russia it seems impossible. We always see in the future,\
  \ making and planning our lives, but not in Elbrus. Locals live measuredly - surprisingly\
  \ - they are enjoying \u201Ctoday\u201D, engaging in fishing, taking everything\
  \ from life...\n \nMaybe this is due to the fact that they live in the indescribable\
  \ beauty... Forests, mountains, rivers. As it can be said: \u201Cthe paradise is\
  \ a place on Earth\u201D - for me, that\u2019s true.\n\nThe aim of the story is\
  \ simple: each journey is different, meaningful and memorable in its own way, so\
  \ people can\u2019t miss the opportunity to travel as much, as it possible."
