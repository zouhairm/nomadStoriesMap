Text: "During the last autumn I got a vacation. Our college was closed for one week.\
  \ Then I made a plan with some of my friends. We wanted to go to outside from Dhaka\
  \ in the vacation. After discussing with our parents we decided to go to Cox\u2019\
  s Bazaar.\n\nWe were six friends. In the early morning we started our journey to\
  \ Cox\u2019s Bazaar by train. We were very excited. We never go outside from Dhaka\
  \ without our parents. In the train we enjoyed a lot. We passed our journey time\
  \ by gossiping, playing cards and reading magazines. We reached at Cox\u2019s Bazaar\
  \ in the afternoon and rented three rooms in a hotel near the sea beach.\n\nI had\
  \ never gone to Cox\u2019s Bazaar before. So I had a curiosity to see the sea. In\
  \ the next morning we went for a walk at the sea beach. It was amazing. After seeing\
  \ the scenery of the sea beach I became speechless.\n\nWe enjoyed the big waves\
  \ splashing endlessly along the shore. We were amused at the frequent change of\
  \ color of the sea. I felt like living there for forever.\n\nWe passed few happy\
  \ hours at the sea beach everyday. We took bath there and played beside the sea\
  \ beach. There we rode on the horse. We took many pictures of the nature. We bought\
  \ many things and collected many stones, shells etc. Everyday we stayed there till\
  \ sunset. The scenery of the sun set of the Bay-of-Bengal is unforgettable. It was\
  \ really a wonderful scene, which is impossible to describe by writing. That can\
  \ be felt only. I will never forget the enjoyable moments of Cox\u2019s Bazaar in\
  \ my life. We stayed for four days. It was really a wonderful experience of my life.\
  \ And I feel that our country is the most beautiful country in the world."
