Text: "Title: Kicking up a fuss\n\nI\u2019m staggering backwards as 500kg of black\
  \ beast heads towards me rearing on its hind legs, I\u2019m dripping with sweat\
  \ into the sand beneath as 35 degrees of hot sun beats down on me and the crowd\
  \ is whooping. As I stumble back, youngsters rush forward, surging perilously underneath\
  \ the beast\u2019s hooves,  reaching for its chest, its beating heart, the \u2018\
  corazon\u2019. This is not \u2013 despite how it sounds - a gladiatorial contest\
  \ of man against beast but rather a celebration of the prowess of horses and riders\
  \ in a Menorcan \u2018jaleo\u2019 \u2013 the \u2018fuss\u2019 of the title.\n\n\
  My first \u2018jaleo\u2019 is in the small Menorcan town of Es Castell, a former\
  \ garrison town during the English occupation of the island in the eighteenth century.\
  \  The jaleo tradition is much, much older than that, dating back to the fourteenth\
  \ century, the significance of its rituals incomprehensible to tourists and myself\
  \ but very much alive in the Menorquin here today.\n\nAnd I\u2019m struggling to\
  \ make sense of what I\u2019ve got myself into, in this former military parade ground\
  \ outside the town hall, gigantic papier-mache figures flanking its doors and crowds\
  \ pressing in on horses and riders as they bow to the bass band playing the traditional\
  \ folk song to which the horses dance on their hind legs. But what feels like pure\
  \ chaos, after observation, turns out to be orchestrated chaos, with a discernible\
  \ pattern to the behaviour of the local townspeople in the ring.\n\nWhat looks like\
  \ the young (and old) proving their bravery by proximity to the horse\u2019s hindquarters\
  \ pushing it onward, is in fact a subtle form of steering the horse, away from the\
  \ edge of the ring and even edgier, nervous tourists. And this man seemingly dancing\
  \ a jig in front of the horse, is attracting its attention, patting its chest to\
  \ encourage it to rear up in the Menorcan \u2018bot\u2019. The bot is an advanced\
  \ dressage move, the horse raises its forelegs off the ground and jumps forward,\
  \ the further forward it moves, the more the crowd applaud. Menorquin horses are\
  \ bred with strong hindquarters, making this difficult technique easier to achieve.\
  \ \n\nAs I\u2019m made of less strong stuff then either the horses or the locals,\
  \  I come out of the jaleo into the shade, seeking fortification in the form of\
  \ pomada, the traditional gin and lemon drink of fiesta. The party is in full swing,\
  \ open air bars on each street corner blaring euro disco, serving friends, families,\
  \ and foreigners alike, with the easy vibe of an extra-large street party.\n\nJust\
  \ as the jaleo winds down with the mayor of the town presenting the traditional\
  \ leafy cane and silver spoon to each rider, thanking them for their skill, the\
  \ wind up for the samba begins. Goat skins of red wine are thrown from the town\
  \ hall windows and everyone competes to catch them in a tangled mess of sweat and\
  \ sand and horse manure. The band strikes up, the crowd chant, clap and jump up\
  \ and down and then the local bomberos, fireman, open up the hydrants and hose the\
  \ crowd down, I\u2019ve never been so grateful for a downpour as I am now.  Bones\
  \ Festes, as they say.\n\nThe fiesta of Sant Jaume happens every year in Es Castell,\
  \ Menorca on 24th, 25th, 26th July. It is a family friendly event and all are welcome.\n\
