Text: "The Summer of 2018 seemed like a good opportunity for me to catch a break from\
  \ my standard 9-5 American work-schedule and grab a flight to Iceland as a connection\
  \ to my final destination - Greece. Flying in at the Icelandic airport, I thought\
  \ to myself that it would have been nice if I had checked the weather forecast before\
  \ departure. The reason for this was that my flip-flops and shorts fitted very poorly\
  \ into the new scenery facing me from the windows at the airport - snow was piling\
  \ in on the streets and people were obviously used to this Winter wonderland. \n\
  \nTravelers seem to attract each other pretty quickly especially at foreign airports\
  \ where everyone is a little bit lost and a little bit alone.\n\nWhile waiting in\
  \ the lobby at the Rejkjavik airport I noticed a girl next to me also dressed in\
  \ a Summer outfit. As a great conversation starter we started joking about how we\
  \ must have made a mistake and we thought we were going to Hawaii. Her name is Maria\
  \ and she is from Mexico. She was attending a local conference in Rejkjavik and\
  \ insisted that I joined her during my time in Iceland since I didn`t have any friends\
  \ in the area. As we were driving off the airport with her Icelandic friends they\
  \ all made a plan to show me the local sights and to introduce me to the culture.\
  \  I felt as I have known them all of my life. Our outgoing personalities, and the\
  \ spirit of adventure made this unusual connection very natural.\n\nWhat really\
  \ impressed me, was that in Summer, Rejkjavik has 20 hours of daylight. At 3 AM\
  \ while standing on the balcony at Maria`s friends house we were so stunned that\
  \ there was no Moon, or stars but it seemed as it was noon, the Sun still shedding\
  \ light over the entire city. The architecture seemed different than any American\
  \ city busy with skyscrapers and constant hurry. In Iceland, all seemed so calm\
  \ and peaceful. We spent the days talking about our different cultures and our backgrounds.\
  \ Someone made a joke that there have never been so many people from different countries\
  \ under a same roof just getting to know each other at an airport and that this\
  \ is probably how The United Nations came to happen. \n\nMaria and I are still friends\
  \ to this day and she is planning to come see me in Kentucky when she gets a chance.\
  \ Airports are such a great place!  Everyone becomes more friendly, accepting and\
  \ lands a hand when in a different environment. Or maybe I was just lucky enough\
  \ to meet a great friend this way."
