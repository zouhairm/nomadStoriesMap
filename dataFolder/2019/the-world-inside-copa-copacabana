Text: "We were late. All the great spots in the sand were already taken. We ended\
  \ up setting up camp in the iconic sidewalks of Copacabana Beach, very far from\
  \ the stage, but just in front of that famous five star hotel everyone knows Rio\
  \ for.\n\nBy the time everyone was settled, B and I decided to get near the security\
  \ grids that were protecting the path that the popemobile was supposed to pass by.\
  \ I saw a readheaded guy standing by the grid and immediatetly thought it was someone\
  \ I knew... Turned out it was a British 15yr old guy named Rory who had traveled\
  \ all the way from the Queen's land to see the new Pope. Nice guy. He looked just\
  \ like Ron Weasley. The book, not the movie one.\n\nAround 7pm, the tide had risen\
  \ and lots of people had to leave the sand and move their camps to the streets.\
  \ God works in misterious ways. \n\nThe sunset's orange glow was merging with the\
  \ light blue sea. Four million people from all around the globe were gathered to\
  \ see his Holiness, and there was no sign of him. B and I managed to \"borrow\"\
  \ a couple of cardboard benches to stand up on, otherwise the only thing we would\
  \ see was Rory's bright red hair matching the sky.\n\nHe came, at last. Kind smile\
  \ on his face, with his heart exposed. No bulletproof glass for this one. I could\
  \ see him coming from the distance, people shouting Francisco and crying all over\
  \ the place. I felt like my soul was trying to get out of my body and greet him.\n\
  \nThere was a cute old couple by our side. They had this little black box they were\
  \ trying to hand out to the security guards. Guess what? It was their 50th year\
  \ anniversary and they wanted the Pope to bless their wedding rings. Impossible?\
  \ No, they got it. The popemobile slowed down in front of us, Pope Francis blessed\
  \ the rings with the cross sign and carried on his walk to the end of the shore.\
  \ The couple shared a kiss and a round of applause. I could see it in their eyes:\
  \ this night was better than their wedding. \n\nMoving on, after the mess, B and\
  \ I went out to explore: so many people to get to know, only one night. My kinda\
  \ challenge. All the while I kept looking around for the Warsaw group we'd met in\
  \ our home town, but they were nowhere to be found.\n\nThe first ones to stop me\
  \ and B were two italian guys. They only wanted a picture with us. Go figure. NEXT!\n\
  We were stopped again by a group of 4-5 Argentines. We shared a quick but very heated\
  \ argument about ''who is better? Pel\xE9 or Maradona?''. No compromises were made.\
  \ The soccer feud still stands. As we were saying 'goodbye', they gave us a little\
  \ plastic bag with soil from \"the land of the Pope\". I would have thought it a\
  \ nice gesture if they hadn't started laughing the minute we turned our backs. You\
  \ can never trust argentines.\n\nA few hours later we'd met all five continents.\
  \ Mindblowing.\n\nI was overwhelmed with joy. I couldn't believe everything I'd\
  \ seen was now embed in my brain and heart. Just when I thought I couldn't get any\
  \ happier, I heard someone shouting a very strange and poorly pronounced version\
  \ of my name. The right redheaded, the polish one, had found me amongst the whole\
  \ wide world inside Copacabana. \n\nHe had lost his group and I was about to set\
  \ B free.\nNo one was asleep, why should we? We spent the night walking on the beach,\
  \ talking about movies and music and books... Julia Roberts and Robin Williams'\
  \ names came up a few times. At some point we found a group from South Africa dancing\
  \ and decided to join them with the best polish-brazilian dance moves we had. No\
  \ one was impressed. But still, we had the best time...\n\nLittle did I know that\
  \ three years later, in the same random way, he would be the first person I'd see\
  \ when I landed in Krakow."
