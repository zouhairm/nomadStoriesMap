Text: "Dear Dad,\n\nI know for a fact that I\u2019m not brave enough to write this\
  \ letter. When you passed away six years ago, I thought any chance of learning where\
  \ you came from died with you. I\u2019m proud to report that I could have not been\
  \ more wrong. \n\nOn September 23, 2018, the day after my 30th birthday, I returned\
  \ to D.C. on the heels of a day-long exploration of naval history in Norfolk, VA.\
  \ Upon walking through my front door, a familiar name flashed across my phone\u2014\
  Dorothy Vigano. I barely said hello before she told me \u201CTroy, the DNA don\u2019\
  t lie. You have cousins in Texas.\u201D \n\nYour time on this Earth was spent, in\
  \ part, wondering why Dorothy kept asking so many questions about your family history.\
  \ It turns out her persistence and love led us to several phone calls and a long\
  \ overdue reunion with people named Casey, Jim, Lewis, Mari, Patsy, Peter and Reagan.\
  \ These folks, Dad, are your cousins\u2014people we thought never existed. They\
  \ helped Dorothy confirm what you already knew. Harry Cohen was indeed your father.\
  \ Your mother was indeed Alyce Hershmann, Harry\u2019s wife. What they also confirmed\
  \ and what you did not know was that your biological mother was Flora DeLuca, a\
  \ train station clerk who met your father in St Louis, Missouri. After you were\
  \ born, you were presented to Alyce by Harry. Alyce, who we presume to have been\
  \ unable to bear children, raised you as if she gave birth to you. Sadly, your grandmother\
  \ Fannie and your aunts never really liked Alyce. It was not because she was a bad\
  \ person. No, it is because nobody was good enough for Harry\u2014the first born\
  \ son of a doting family. Unfortunately, a fight for your custody ensued. Alyce\
  \ eventually took off for California with you in tow. She was so afraid to lose\
  \ you that she changed your surname from Cohen to Cornell and for the next 75 years\
  \ of your life, your whereabouts became a total mystery to your Cohen family. For\
  \ years, your grandma Fannie attempted to find you. She even employed private investigators\
  \ with the hopes of finding her most dear grandson. She never knew what became of\
  \ you. \n\nWhile on the flight to Houston, while sitting in the rental car, and\
  \ while tossing and turning on each creaky hotel bed I kept asking myself: \u201C\
  What am I doing?\u201D \u201CWhy am I here?\u201D \u201CIs the truth really worth\
  \ knowing?\u201D After all, it has always been easier to tell people, \u201CYeah,\
  \ we just have a really small family.\u201D Prior to my birthday, I accepted and\
  \ made peace with the reality that I was the last person in your bloodline. Now\
  \ as I reflect upon the moment where I was gazing upon your grandmother\u2019s grave\
  \ in San Antonio, the truth, while elusive, was well worth the effort. I am proud\
  \ to say\u2014your search for your family has come to an end. \n\nI often think\
  \ back to all of the times you tried to remember where you came from. I avoided\
  \ and still avoid those thoughts because of the lifelong pain it brought you. It\
  \ is a feeling of vulnerability that I am still not comfortable with. However, as\
  \ I sat alone in the Lone Star State I realized that I needed to do it for you.\
  \ After making you spend the last years of your life giving me everything you had,\
  \ I needed to give you this\u2014the gift of knowing that people you have never\
  \ met have loved you more than you can ever imagine. \n\nIt was and still is a joy\
  \ and a privilege to recount for your family all of the ways that you put a smile\
  \ on people\u2019s faces, including mine. While you cannot be here to experience\
  \ this for yourself, I hope you know that your long-lost Texan family is infinitely\
  \ grateful for you."
