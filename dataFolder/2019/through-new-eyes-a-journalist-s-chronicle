Text: "I stood at the hotel lobby looking like lost sheep. I pinched myself to be\
  \ sure I wasn\u2019t dreaming. I couldn\u2019t be in a dream and be standing in\
  \ the lobby of one of the most famous hotels in America. Washington Hilton Hotel\
  \ was made famous by the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan after a speaking\
  \ engagement there. \nI pulled my luggage behind me as I headed to the front desk\
  \ and stood on the queue.  \nAs I stood there, my admiring gaze roved the hotel\
  \ and fell on five people (three ladies and two guys) seated comfortably and chatting\
  \ away. From their looks anyone could tell they were not American. They must be\
  \ part of the program, I told myself. The voice of the lady at the front desk brought\
  \ me back to the present. I looked up and saw her staring straight at me. It was\
  \ my turn to be attended to. \n\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D I muttered and stepped\
  \ forward. \nI answered her questions and received my room key, a bag and a travel\
  \ guide on how to navigate Washington DC. As I turned to leave, a middle-aged man\
  \ introduced himself as Mark. He was one of the liaison officers attached to us.\
  \ He introduced me to the five people I was staring at earlier. I was right. They\
  \ were part of the program and were from Russia, The Bahamas, Tanzania, Hong Kong\
  \ and New Zealand.  \nThese five plus seventeen more would later become part of\
  \ my travel adventure.\n*\t*\t*\nThere we were 23 journalists from 22 countries\
  \ on a Multi-Regional Project sponsored by US Department of State. The trip would\
  \ help international journalists to study and learn about American politics, media,\
  \ and culture. Before we left our various countries, we were given the itinerary.\
  \ Washington DC was the first stop then journalists would be split into four groups\
  \ to travel to four separate states. After five days, everyone would regroup to\
  \ travel together to Minneapolis, Minnesota and finally to California. It looked\
  \ like a whole year\u2019s trip but it was just three weeks. I was in Alabama group.\
  \ Washington DC held a lot of rich history and still kept the legacy of the founding\
  \ fathers.  \n*\t*\t*\n\nAlabama was about 45 minutes\u2019 drive from Huntsville\
  \ and home to our hosts Angela and James True and Deborah, their family friend.\
  \ Angela True was a paramedic who retired to dedicate her time to her passion \u2013\
  \ art/painting. She had a room filled with her beautiful works of art.\nJames, also\
  \ called Jim, apart from being a music lover was a collector of vintage cars. He\
  \ took us to his garage and allowed us a ride in one of them \u2013 the 1940 Buick\
  \ Century! The night was filled with discussion bothering especially on politics/Trump\
  \ policies and how other countries saw those policies. There were lots of laughter\
  \ and jokes. Sadly, we had to go home but not without pictures. \n*\t*\t*\n\nAs\
  \ we departed Minneapolis, called the Twin Cities, in the state of Minnesota, I\
  \ took along fond memories. The rich history, the people and importantly the cold\
  \ accompanied by snowballs. (I still couldn't wrap my mind around the \u201CIt's\
  \ not even cold yet\u201D' that I constantly got from the people of Minneapolis).\
  \ \n\nMen! Minneapolis was cold. Even the rising of the sun didn\u2019t diminish\
  \ the coldness. One striking thing was the beautiful view the snow gave the city\
  \ at night. Another was the sky-walks. They gave the city a unique look and if you\
  \ were not careful, you could get lost in transit. \n*\t*\t*\n\nWe arrived at Sacramento,\
  \ the capital city of California, somehow, a consolation for the cold in Minneapolis.\
  \ California was our last stop before we returned to our various countries. While\
  \ in Sacramento, we toured the governor\u2019s office, something that would never\
  \ happen in Nigeria. \nIn three weeks I had visited four states in the USA, had\
  \ a wholesome cultural exchange experience, and visited notable historical sites.\
  \ In three weeks, I\u2019d become professionally stronger. And most of all, I\u2019\
  d had great ideas-sharing experiences and made new friends most of whom later became\
  \ very close."
