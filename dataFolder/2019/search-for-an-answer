Text: "\"Did you run away from your home?\", the first thing that came to anyone's\
  \ mind who chose to give me a lift.\n\nHundreds miles away from home, stranded on\
  \ a highway, penniless and munching on a homemade sandwich- the battle between my\
  \ heart and my brain intensifies as I question my decision. Rewind twenty four hours,\
  \ I was all snuggled up in my cosy bed. After fighting depression and bedridden\
  \ sickness, all I wanted was an answer, from life. \n\nGoing through the pages of\
  \ an old magazine, these words pushed me in the search of that eluded answer. The\
  \ words of Anthony Bourdain keep floating in my mind; \u201CIf you\u2019re twenty-two,\
  \ physically fit, hungry to learn and be better, I urge you to travel \u2013 as\
  \ far and as widely as possible. Sleep on floors if you have to. Find out how other\
  \ people live and eat and cook...\u201D. Plucking up my courage, I decided to hit\
  \ the road penniless to whichever direction it takes me. \nLittle did this determined\
  \ but inexperienced traveler know what was waiting for him. The moon's slow descent\
  \ over the horizon was the first signal for my departure from the comfort of known\
  \ surroundings. The beginning is always the hardest, and it was no different in\
  \ this scenario. There was an evident uneasiness when I tried to lift my thumb asking\
  \ for a lift initially. But with the passing time, unfamiliar faces but reliable\
  \ characters made sure I never give up on my quest. It was hard for them to perceive\
  \ what it\u2019s like to be a penniless wanderer, but they valued my struggle, nonetheless.\
  \ The sun was at its highest, blazing, when I finally crossed the first state border-\
  \ the signboard flashing \"WELCOME TO ORISSA\".\n\n\"The world isn't safe dear,\
  \ don't do this\"- resonated from everyone's lips. Two hundred miles away from my\
  \ adobe, standing on the deserted road, I felt stronger than ever. With time, this\
  \ rookie traveler's exhaustion forced him to take shelter in a nearby mosque. The\
  \ country brewing hatred and bitterness over religion, seemed so different- smiling\
  \ faces greeted me, provided me the love we all long for.  The opportunity to contemplate\
  \ life comes in a bitter sweet form. The dark night meant it was time to find a\
  \ place to rest this wearied soul of mine after a long day and a bus terminal nearby\
  \ was the ideal place i could have prayed for. \n\nA sound sleep far off my warm\
  \ bed, on a rugged bench felt more soothing. Did I come across the answer, I was\
  \ frantically searching for? I WISH I KNEW or DO YOU?"
