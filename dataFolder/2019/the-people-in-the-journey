Text: "\u201CHow are you even replying from the desert?\u201D \n\n\u201CThe soul of\
  \ the world has good wifi!\u201D \n\nI grinned when I read the message. It seemed\
  \ like an absurd statement in contrast to its reference \u2013 the journey to find\
  \ oneself described in exquisite detail in The Alchemist, what seemed to me to be\
  \ some sort of bible for hundreds of long-term travelers looking for greater meaning\
  \ in life. I had seen the book lying casually in the background of one of your travel\
  \ photos, and it wove its way into the many things we discussed, for hours, as we\
  \ each made our journeys of self-discovery across the European continent.  \n\n\
  Now you were in Morocco, cycling across the Sahara, and sharing your experiences\
  \ of thirst, of the vast, echoing beauty of the landscape, and of frustration with\
  \ the fine grains of sand that found their way into every piece of clothing and\
  \ equipment you owned. I was in London, shocked by the normality of day to day life\
  \ there, in a culture not too different from the one I had left behind and hanging\
  \ on every word of adventures unknown.  \n\nWhen I heard the drifting notes of the\
  \ jazz band winding through the back streets of Seville and turned, on impulse,\
  \ towards them, I never expected to find myself standing in front of a mirror. \
  \ I remember the dim light of the bar, the familiar smell of old beer, and my awkwardness\
  \ in ordering a drink I can\u2019t remember in clumsy Spanish, just to have a reason\
  \ to sit there.  \n\nIt often happens that those on a journey encounter others on\
  \ similar paths. A glass of wine. A shared understanding. Stories of aching feet,\
  \ missed trains and broken bags which strew the handful of items representing your\
  \ life across the ground like garbage. Great food. The people you\u2019ve met. Heroic\
  \ tales of duct tape. Then the moment passes, and you go your separate ways, remembering\
  \ them fondly. The universe in which you were aligned and connected fades softly\
  \ away.  \n\nBut here we were, on separate journeys but sharing every step. Place\
  \ by place, day after day, month after month. We were both on a mission \u2013 maybe\
  \ to find ourselves, or a place in the world. We crossed paths a few times, but\
  \ mostly we crossed countries on separate trajectories. We spoke of things we saw\
  \ that were good in the world, and things that made us sad. Gradually, my journey\
  \ began to fill me with energy, an increased confidence that I knew who I was; I\
  \ called out, and the soul of the world had answered. Here you are, and this is\
  \ your path. It will lead you home.  \n\nLike the shepherd Santiago, I followed\
  \ the signs, though the path led finally to an unexpected belonging on the other\
  \ side of the world from where I\u2019d begun. You grew tired, and followed the\
  \ call back to your childhood home. Our journeys ended, and that travelers\u2019\
  \ moment \u2013 the moment in which we were aligned and connected, although a long\
  \ one, faded softly away.  \n\nI kept the memory that we had somehow, strangely,\
  \ shared the same journey, like two sides of a coin, or the slightly strange other-world\
  \ you can peer into through a mirror. From time to time I thought about what I had\
  \ found on that quest, and why somehow you felt that you didn\u2019t, despite the\
  \ experiences that you had, whether I had been there or just glimpsed them through\
  \ the mirror. The connections with old travelling friends. The surprising joy of\
  \ tasting a simple pizza in Milan after weeks of eating almost the same tagine meal\
  \ after meal. The astonishing beauty and coldness of lakes that stretched away before\
  \ you, to the feet of mountains you determined to cross.  \n\nI never expected the\
  \ shock and loss I would feel, a year later, when I scrolled suddenly past a Facebook\
  \ memorial to you, and the inexplicable decision you had made to take another kind\
  \ of journey.  \n\nSometimes I think about telling you of the places I\u2019ve been,\
  \ and the things I\u2019ve seen. Perhaps you\u2019ll get the message. \n\nAfter\
  \ all, you did say the soul of the world has good wifi."
