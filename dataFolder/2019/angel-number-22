Text: "Number 22.. unfortunately not a number of countries I traveled more like a\
  \ number of guys I slept with from different countries. What an introduction. \n\
  Everything started when I had my final exam and I picked question number 22 (only\
  \ one I actually learned). I finally finished my studies and plan was clear... Dream\
  \ trip to Asia with my sister. I wish to say I worked hard to earn money for it\
  \ but the truth is I just withdrawal all the money out of my building savings (thanks\
  \ dad). \nthe cheapest flight was with Russian airlines in spite of bad rating I\
  \ couldn't be happier. Here we go...first stop - Vietnam. Finally, see you from\
  \ a different perspective than walls of Vietnamese mini markets in Czech. First\
  \ finding.. air is definitely better in mini markets. This article is about a making\
  \ local connection..oh and my lucky number (completely forgot about that). So let's\
  \ skip a few Asian countries. Internet connection in most of them sucks but I definitely\
  \ manage to make a local connection in every one of them, which gets me closer to\
  \ the number 22. But this story is about one.  \nOn the site called Workaway, we\
  \ found a volunteering job at the art gallery in Malaysia. Minimum stay is one month.\
  \ We have got time to make some connection. Manager of the place, his name was James,\
  \ opened the door for us and gave us a tour. This place wasn't really an art gallery\
  \ but more like a chill place for all kind of artists. I can hear the tunes of my\
  \ favorite song coming from downstairs. I walked down, opened the door and here\
  \ he stands, scratching vinyl of Wu-tang at the time 22:22. \nHis name was Yohan\
  \ and he was Chinese, graphic designer/ Dj. From the first moment, I fell for him.\
  \ He took me for a couple of dates and on the third one, we decided to go to Borneo\
  \ together. The night before our flight took me to his house...Correct!..the number\
  \ of the house was 22. \nHere we are... The second biggest island in the world.\
  \ First to see was definitely a jungle. The only monkey I saw was the one who stole\
  \ my wallet which Yohan dropped whilst being attacked by this monkey. \nWhen we\
  \ got back to our Airbnb Yohan started to kiss me ... and then it happened, my first\
  \ orgasm (not from kissing obviously). What a nice reward for the stolen wallet.\
  \ We definitely had a strong connection. \nWhen we got back to Kuala Lumpur Yohan\
  \ was invited to play on the premiere's son birthday party. He took me and a couple\
  \ of friends from the art gallery with him. I got a little bit drunk and.. well...\
  \ When Yohan finished playing the son of the premiere started. I went to him and\
  \ loudly said \"your music sucks\". Everyone was horrified and later told me to\
  \ go and apologize to him.. so I did... I entranced the VIP salon with all the glance...\
  \ \" I'm sorry, I didn't know you are the son of premiere but I don't give a fuck\"\
  . The feedback was surprisingly positive. He said, he respects me and invited me\
  \ and the rest for drinks. After the party, we went for some late street food and\
  \ there was a guy with number 22 on his shirt. Then my friend told me those are\
  \ angel numbers and every one of them has a different meaning. Mine means I'm on\
  \ the right path. After this, I started thinking if this is what I really want.\
  \ I came to Asia to travel and not to stay in one place. I told my sister its time\
  \ to go somewhere else so we bought flights to Nepal. \n22 wasn't a sign of big\
  \ love it just showed me as long as I travel I'm on the right path. So I do. Writing\
  \ this article from the address Buenos Aires 22, Gran Canaria. Making other special\
  \ connections and having a time of my life."
