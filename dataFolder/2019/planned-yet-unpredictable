Text: "This wasn't my first time out of the country, though it was my first to Indonesia.\
  \ Bali was the initial plan, a place exotic and completely different from my home\
  \ in Colorado. This trip was bound to be different, however, as there were greater\
  \ forces at work that would change the course of my life. \n\nMeeting people online\
  \ is not uncommon now days and as luck would have it I came across a local from\
  \ Jakarta. Our conversation was polite as we described our home towns and the differences\
  \ between our worlds. Mine was at elevation, primarily dry with four seasons. Hers\
  \ was at sea level while primarily hot and rainy. Apart from the climate differences\
  \ and being on polar opposites of the planet, there was also the cultural differences\
  \ that we were both fascinated by. As you can imagine we spoke about Bali and despite\
  \ her proximity she had yet to go. To my surprise, Renata agreed to join me on this\
  \ trip and see what we could discover together.\n\nI know what you are thinking,\
  \ isn't that risky? Planning a trip with someone I just met. I agree, but at the\
  \ same time I knew I was aware of the situation enough to be able to make smart\
  \ decisions. Afterall, I had done plenty of travelling on my own and have always\
  \ made it back alive. Plus, a local\u2019s perspective could only mean I can learn\
  \ and experience more about this region of the world.\n\nWith the flight tickets\
  \ purchased, everything was falling into place. I even had one Airbnb rented. Then,\
  \ one evening while looking at activities in Bali, I see it all over the news. Mount\
  \ Agung is set to erupt. It was showing signs of life and it wasn't a question of\
  \ if, but when.  Now, its proximity to Denpasar is such that it is far enough away\
  \ not to be a threat to anyone there, but the ash cloud would reach the city and\
  \ potentially ground airlines and cause any incoming to the Java island instead.\
  \ After two weeks of more volatile activity from the volcano I decided to change\
  \ my trip. Renata kindly offered to help me plan a trip to the Java Island instead.\n\
  \nTrusting my gut has never worked out so well in my life. I allowed this local\
  \ to feed me info on local attractions and her suggestions were amazing and surely\
  \ set me up for a trip to remember. She also took it upon herself to plan the logistics\
  \ of transportation! I was a little nervous to be honest as I had given up a lot\
  \ of control for this trip and didn\u2019t quite know what to expect. Tales of tourists\
  \ being kidnapped ran through my head. I admit this was more of the warnings I might\
  \ receive from my mother and family. As you can imagine I did not fill any of them\
  \ in on my plans other than the fact I was going to Jakarta, Indonesia. \n\nI arrived\
  \ in Jakarta late, just after midnight. I could feel the humidity right away. I\
  \ stood out obviously and could feel people trying to determine where I was from.\
  \ Was Renata going to be waiting outside? Would I recognize her? I tell myself to\
  \ stay calm. After customs, I walk out of the small terminal into the dimly lit\
  \ parking lot. No sign of her. Immediately a cab driver comes to my side offering\
  \ his services. He could tell I was lost. I tiredly keep walking down the sidewalk\
  \ trying to avoid him. A couple more minutes pass and I am already thinking I may\
  \ have to go back into the airport and figure something out. I would just need to\
  \ get an internet connection, ask some questions, and I could at least get through\
  \ this night. Is it getting hotter? Then, I hear footsteps and a soft voice calling\
  \ my name. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders and a smile came to my face right\
  \ away. I turn and there she is, just as she said she would be. I was awake now\
  \ and excited for what the next day would bring."
