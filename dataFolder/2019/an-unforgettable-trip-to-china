Text: "Visiting another country was one of my precious dreams that I shared with my\
  \ inner when I was young. After graduating from the University of Oran, Algeria\
  \ ; I thought I would explore one of the English speaking countries to enrich my\
  \ professional experience in this language. The opportunity took place and God has\
  \ chosen me to visit China on April 2013 on a business trip.\n      Early at school\
  \ ,in a history class, we were told that China is a sleeping giant and that it was\
  \ one of the biggest and strongest economies,and that was right true; cause all\
  \ products imported to Algeria were labeled 'Made in China'; though sometimes I\
  \ received some gifts from France where some of my relatives live ,but still the\
  \ label 'Made in China' engraved at the bottom of every object.\n      The idea\
  \ of the sleeping giant started to take effects in my deep conscious and  I started\
  \ to respect and think seriously of this country of more than a billion of inhabitants.\n\
  \   When we landed at Guangzhou international airport  in  April 2013, the weather\
  \ was cloudy, a bit rainy and wet. The city was so clean and organized that I thought\
  \ I was in a big castle and not outside in the street. All people were busy working\
  \ as bees and no one paid attention to the other, that was the first criterion that\
  \ shows hard work and perseverance; we tried to pick up a taxi and we succeeded\
  \ with my friend; but we failed to book a room in a hotel as almost all hotels were\
  \ full.\n      This Metropolitan city has a population of about 12 million inhabitants,\
  \ bigger than the inhabitants of Lybia, a neighboring country to Algeria. Chinese\
  \ people are shy, polite and helpful; however they are poor speakers-they speak\
  \ no language but Chinese-We had a really hard time to find a restaurant, a pharmacist\
  \ or even a mall. when passing by their restaurants , you can smell odors that probably,\
  \ you have not smelled before since they eat almost everything including flying,\
  \ swimming, jumping and walking insects and all types of animals be it savage or\
  \ gentle-domestic-.\n      Exploring China was amazing, this continent country has\
  \ everything and its people miss everything if they do not work harder and harder.\
  \ It seems that work here is more than a duty or a responsibility, for them I guess,\
  \ it is a religion.\n        I have not met a lot of poor people there, as everyone\
  \ goes to work almost everyday; and the few poor people I met were handicapped people\
  \ who were by no means unable to perform any job.\n    In a visit in a district\
  \ there, we were received warmly and happily, we were important buyers in their\
  \ eyes .the Chinese can produce everything, with all qualities and be sure that\
  \ the more you pay, the better is your goods and the opposite is true. In one of\
  \ our visits, we were offered a Chinese tea ,I really liked it but I would have\
  \ liked it much more if it were with sugar. We have to bear in mind that Chinese\
  \ people drink their big varieties of tea with no sugar, otherwise all the world\u2019\
  s sugar will not be enough for them.\n   I spent an exciting fortnight in China,\
  \ of course eating in Yemeni restaurant that serves Arab and Turkish or Indian foods\
  \ but not Chinese. Though the foods were delicious, but they can never be as sweet\
  \ as one's country foods or more particularly as one's mother's or wife's foods.I\
  \ do admit, no other food can replace my home sweet home's foods.\nI learned a lot\
  \ from this amazing country with its simple people, we can see the western traditions\
  \ invading their look , houses and events,but there still a shining side from their\
  \ culture in every corner of the city. If I am to advise you before you fly to China\
  \ ,I would tell you ,learn some key Chinese words, do not kid with women sellers\
  \ and when passing by their restaurants, buy yourself a fresh perfume and insert\
  \ a drop into your nose , you may vomit if your stomach is full at times. \n   \
  \                                                                              \
