Text: "I was slowly submerging into the ocean and did not know how to swim. And I\
  \ chose to take that leap into the unknown. Little did I realise that it would change\
  \ my life forever.\n\nIt was a bright sunny day in Phuket and I had visited Thailand\
  \ for the first time. There could not have been a better combination of sun, water,\
  \ greenery and sands - served on the same platter. On our way to \u2018James Bond\u2019\
  \ island, I took a quick detour to experience an UNPLANNED SCUBA DIVE.\n\nI could\
  \ feel my heart thumping at its loudest best. \u201CWill I be able to do it?\u201D\
  \ - I was still skeptical and a million thoughts crossed my mind. Back then, I was\
  \ a 27-year old and did not know how to swim. And there was a reason why I hadn\u2019\
  t learnt swimming! Until my adulthood, I used to even turn my back towards the shower\
  \ in the bath. I was BORDERLINE HYDROPHOBIC and my mind kept reminding that to me.\n\
  \nThe training was local and they had basic scuba diving gear. While the trainer\
  \ was giving instructions, I just couldn\u2019t take my eyes off his tobacco-stained\
  \ teeth. The hygiene Nazi inside me cringed at the idea of grabbing oxygen masks\
  \ in our mouth, used by countless people with questionable dental hygiene. But I\
  \ still held my guard! \u201CIf not now, then never\u201D - my heart kept boosting\
  \ my spirit.\n\nI signed a waiver form for the activity and got suited up. Since\
  \ I was quite skinny, the hands of the diving suit fitted loose and the breathing\
  \ gear was slightly oversized for my pint-sized nose. The oxygen cylinder was extremely\
  \ heavy for my tiny frame. \u201CWere these signs? Should I abort the plan?\u201D\
  \ - My mind kept urging. But, my heart kept racing back and pushing me saying -\
  \ \u201CKeep calm. You can definitely do it.\u201D\n\nAs I stepped into the sea,\
  \ my trainer asked me to lie down and relax on the waters. My heart had started\
  \ thumping louder. It was a strange conflict between the urge to quit and the excitement\
  \ to enjoy. Gradually, I started sinking into the waters. The water crossed my ears,\
  \ touched my lips and started rising above my nose. I was sinking deeper and deeper.\
  \ Within few seconds, I realised that I can\u2019t breathe. My nervous energy made\
  \ me fumble with the instructions. I made a gesture that I was not feeling okay\
  \ and was immediately pulled up to the surface.\n\nI removed the oxygen mask immediately\
  \ and inhaled fresh air. Wish I could explain what exactly my lungs felt, at that\
  \ moment! I recollected the trainer\u2019s instructions - \u201CNever breathe from\
  \ your nose, breathe through your mouth.\u201D In my nervousness, I had stopped\
  \ breathing from my nose and simultaneously also forgot to breathe through the mouth.\
  \ That made me restless and gasp for breath.\n\nSoon, I started enjoying the beautiful\
  \ sky, lying flat on the ocean and decided to take a second shot. I started sinking\
  \ into the unknown. As soon as my head submerged completely, I struggled to find\
  \ a rhythm between - not breathing through my nostrils and sucking in oxygen through\
  \ my mouth. But, eventually, I mastered the art. There was a soothing calmness under\
  \ water. My hands were shivering with fear of the unknown, but my heart kept longing\
  \ for diving deeper and deeper. Soon, beautiful fishes started swimming around me.\
  \ I started feeling like a mermaid. The coral reefs were so beautiful and soon my\
  \ feet touched one of the rocks. It felt like standing deep down the ocean. It felt\
  \ like home.\n\nThe shoal of fish swam in harmony, their territories were not demarcated\
  \ and there were no worldly rules as such. Probably, they had their own rules. For\
  \ a moment, the unknown felt like one of my own.\n\nWithin no time, it was time\
  \ to bid goodbye to this surreal world. Slowly, I moved towards the water surface,\
  \ leaving behind the deep blue ocean. On resurfacing, I lay flat on the waters and\
  \ soaked in all the goodness of the ocean. Probably, my hydrophobia was diminished\
  \ and my heart longed to go back to the unknown!"
