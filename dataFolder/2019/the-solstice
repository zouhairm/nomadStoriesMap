Text: "The birds were singing their evening songs, hidden in forceful oaks and fail\
  \ birches. Neither my friend nor I said anything. We were impressed by everything\
  \ that was going on around us. We could catch fritters of conversations. Lithuanian\
  \ was hard to understand but at the same moment so pleasant to listen, especially\
  \ with brisk melody floating in a background.  The place was magical: huge field\
  \ on the top of the hill, located near Vilnius, with an amazing view, in the middle\
  \ of the forest. We came closer to brae and we saw a memorable view: a ribbon of\
  \ Vilia river was traversing green fields burdened with luscious grasses and white\
  \ flowers of buckwheat.\nWe took flowers, herbs and oak\u2019s branch from wicker\
  \ baskets. We sat on the grass. The humidity was evaporating from green stalks creating\
  \ this unique scent, which you can smell only during summer, on the endless meadow\
  \ or huge glade. We started to plait our flower crowns. Sharp grasses were hurting\
  \ our fingers, but it didn\u2019t matter. It was a moment of pure joy. Pure experience\
  \ of the nature. When we put our crowns on heads, we felt united with primaeval\
  \ traditions and all people around who came here to celebrate Rasos, Kupoles, Jonines.\
  \ \nWhen the day started to mix in one with the drabness of dusk, pieces of wood\
  \ started to burn. It was the biggest fire I ever saw. Nonetheless, the bravest\
  \ men and women were jumping through the flames to clean their spirits from bad\
  \ energy. The smoke took it away up to the bright sky full of the stars. Older women\
  \ wearing linen dresses, girls with flower crowns on their heads, men begirded with\
  \ leather belts, all of them came to celebrate the solstice.\nSounds of music played\
  \ on the Lithuanian folk instruments such as birbyn\u0117 or kankl\u0117s drifted\
  \ people into joyful dances. I was hypnotized by this scene. My friend took me away\
  \ from my pensiveness. Her black eyes were shining while she said one word: Witch.\
  \ I followed her. We walk through the darkness of the forest and we saw a little\
  \ tent. Women, man, girls and boys were lining, patiently, each one holding their\
  \ own natural bouquet.  \nStupefied, we called the attention of a girl with a  majestic\
  \ flower crown on her blonde hair, she ran to us with the lightness of doe. Without\
  \ any introduction, she said: \u2018You have to pick seven herbs and bring them\
  \ to the witch. Then she will tell you about your future\u2019. \nFollowing her\
  \ instructions, we split to gather our seven herbs in the forest. It took us half\
  \ an hour to find and pick the right plants. The grass was wet, so while we were\
  \ waiting in the line to the tent, we weren\u2019t sure if were shaking of excitement\
  \ or coldness. \nFrom the tent of the witch all were going out in calm reverie.\
  \ Finally, it was my turn. I enter the tent and I saw a woman who was no older than\
  \ forty. I was a bit surprised. I always imagined witches as old, wrinkled biddy.\
  \ Her deep-set eyes were lustrating my face. \n-    Show me \u2013 she said and\
  \ reach out her bony hand. I gave her my herbs. She looked carefully at the oak\
  \ leaves, a blade of grass, leave of Plantago lancelota, and other plants, I don\u2019\
  t know the name. The witch told me many things. I cannot share any of them. It is\
  \ a secret just between me and the Lithuanian witch.\nIt was half an hour before\
  \ midnight, all the people gathered in one place, they took torches and walked towards\
  \ the river at the rhythm of a song. The fire lighted the muddy road. We arrived\
  \ at the river. Girls took off their flower crowns and put them over a wooden cross\
  \ with a candle in the middle. They carry them to the river of Vilia and gently,\
  \  laid them down in the water stream, creating a magical landscape. Faces of the\
  \ people were shrouded in a glow of candles. Everyone was staring up in the river,\
  \ as it was possible to read from it all stories about gods and people."
