Text: "I sit in the U-bahn listening to music quietly humming along. I think to myself\
  \ that I miss singing in my car at the top of my lungs. The U-Bahn suddenly stops\
  \ interrupting my thoughts, everyone exits the U-Bahn, so I exit too. Utterly lost\
  \ in this immense station, I decide it actually doesn\u2019t matter which way I\
  \ go. As I finally exit the never-ending maze of Ostbahnhof, the frigid air blows\
  \ burning my ears and face, but it doesn\u2019t bother me. Instead I close my eyes\
  \ take a deep breath, and then calmly walk around looking for the famous East Side\
  \ Gallery, a surviving piece of the Berlin wall. \n\nThe vivid colors and expressions\
  \ of emotions towards this concrete division effectively conceal its reality, and\
  \ make it impossible to miss. I pass by the most famous paintings including the\
  \ kiss between Leonid Brezhnev and Erich Honecker by Dmitri Vrubel, and Birgit Kinder\u2019\
  s mural of the Trabi breaking through the walls, but my curiosity wanders to an\
  \ interruption within this eternal canvas.\n\nIt leaves me dumbfounded. The colorful\
  \ facade is shattered instantly by the other side a vandalized ugly grey scraped\
  \ wall. I reach to touch this horrific crumbling wall and slowly trace the red graffiti\
  \ letters: Why?\n\nI stare blankly at the wall unable to imagine its standing terror.\
  \ After about 5 minutes of staring, I continue to walk unaware till the glistening\
  \ Oberbaumbr\xFCcke tells me its over.\n\nSuddenly, I realize the entire scenery\
  \ is extremely absurd. The sun shines brightly on the Spree and the Oberbaumbr\xFC\
  cke, yet its warmth evades my body. Right across the picturesque river stand old\
  \ abandoned graffitied buildings in the shadows adding a contrasting gloomy grey\
  \ to the background.\n\nI sit on the steps and take out my beloved grandfather's\
  \ picture from my backpack. It\u2019s old and faded, but there he is clearly standing\
  \ in front of the infamous Berlin Wall. Days before I left to Berlin my grandmother\
  \ gave me the photograph. She simply said \"Your Grandfather loved Berlin. We were\
  \ there when it fell.\" Since his death my grandmother rarely speaks about him so\
  \ I knew better than to ask why did he love it? I was also in love with this place.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t explain it, but the moment I got off the plane I just knew I was\
  \ in the right place.\n\nBirds flew up in the sky and the slight breeze gently rattled\
  \ the dead leaves on the trees, I began to think of my father. His last words before\
  \ my departure were \"I don\u2019t know where we went wrong but I just want you\
  \ to be happy.\" I couldn\u2019t explain why everything changed overnight, except\
  \ that when I woke up the wall was already there. It chained me to living two separate\
  \ lives. It was a paradoxical attempt of protection from the monstrosities of life\
  \ and a scream of bloody power, but ironically it did the exact opposite. It only\
  \ inflicted agony, struggle, weakness, and annihilation. Was it enough to answer\
  \ his why with I\u2019m only human?\n\nI look back at the wall standing behind me\
  \ and wonder why this happened? I look at the picture again and realize that many\
  \ people could not fathom a foreseeable future without this wall, yet it no longer\
  \ stands. Instead a wild volatile untamable Berlin rose from the rubble embracing\
  \ the obscene and immaculate. Maybe this is why my grandfather loved the city. Everyone\
  \ knew him as an incredibly generous, kind, humble human being, but he struggled\
  \ hiding his many addictions throughout his life. The grievances and joys of life\
  \ are the ensemble of this strangely unique city. I unfortunately followed my grandfather\u2019\
  s footsteps and maybe this is why I ended up here, to acknowledge both the light\
  \ and dark, not to question why this is my life. Instead to trust and embrace the\
  \ unknown that the indestructible will one day be destructible.\n\nBefore putting\
  \ the picture away, I take one last glimpse of the Berlin wall and head into the\
  \ unknown with the comforting thought that everything even this formidable wall\
  \ is temporary, and oddly enough only change is constant."
