Text: "My first large trip was two years ago when I went to England. Till that time\
  \ I had never crossed the broad, spoken another language for the whole day and had\
  \ never even flown by plane! Everything was covered by mystery for me, and I didn\u2019\
  t know what I really needed to do while my journey. I didn\u2019t know the world,\
  \ but I wanted to discover it. \nFirst flight impressed me a lot. I had a feeling\
  \ of light, of wings behind me. I saw green and golden lands in full view, blue\
  \ frozen sky with soft clouds, gray cities. Maybe after this situation I started\
  \ to get information about unknown world. \nOne of my friends once said \u201CThere\
  \ are no differences between countries. The only thing, which make the territories\
  \ divers, is language\u201D. However, every detail was new in England for me! I\
  \ leapt into the unknown reality of the new world. I have visited a few cities,\
  \ except Bournemouth (the place where I was living): London, Bath, Oxford and Winchester.\
  \ These cities showed me a really great atmosphere of the part of the United Kingdom.\
  \ I think the best one for me was Bath. It is a classical city which keeps traditions\
  \ alive. There were perfect architecture, beautiful streets full of stories and\
  \ legends and marvelous landscapes. I fell in love with Bath Abby; no photos can\
  \ show us the royalty of this building, its size and details peculiar for old times.\
  \ Bath keeps memoirs about Jane Austen who is one of my favorite writers. You know,\
  \ she wrote about this city not only in the letters, but in the book \u201CNorthanger\
  \ Abbey\u201D. And of course I can\u2019t forget Bath chocolate. \nThe unknown world\
  \ spoke English to me. It was interesting, because I have never practised this language\
  \ so much previously. I heard different people from many countries and I felt that\
  \ the world became smaller. English bracketed people together. It helped me to find\
  \ new friends and become acquainted with the surrounding. \nBesides that, I paid\
  \ attention to lifestyle of people from England and the cultural aspect. I liked\
  \ English people`s thoughts about life, their attitude to nature and shining eyes\
  \ when they are talking. I felt warm and welcome atmosphere everywhere. Also, I\
  \ have always been interested in culture of different countries, so I had all chances\
  \ to make my mind full of information about it on every excursion. For example,\
  \ I visited   Winchester Castle, because I was a fan of legends about King Arthur\
  \ and magician Merlin. All blocks of the Castle kept a part of the history. Do you\
  \ know this awesome thing when you are taught something old and beautiful? I didn\u2019\
  t loose the moment to palm the stones of the museum, and in that moment I felt real\
  \ magic. I absorbed every detail and story, looked at the great model of King Arthur\u2019\
  s Table and enjoyed the power of the building.  \nHowever, everything finishes in\
  \ one day. So I needed to return home after my traveling. It was a pity, I didn\u2019\
  t want to leave the place which became so precious for me. Oh, really precious?\
  \ It was unknown only two weeks ago\u2026 \nThe world is unknown, but I want and\
  \ I will use every chance to learn it, to become closer to it. The world is big,\
  \ but I can contain it in my heart. I am ready to make a leap into unknown every\
  \ time, because I am not afraid to do it. And always when I leap into unknown it\
  \ will be the best feelings in my life."
