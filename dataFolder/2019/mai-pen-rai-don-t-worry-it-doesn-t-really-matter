  \ Well,  this is what I heard about before making my way to Thailand. Since Bangkok\
  \ was my first destination, I thought \u201Cyep, it\u2019s all true.\u201D  However,\
  \ traveling around wasn\u2019t  my purpose for this trip. As I moved to my destination,\
  \ a town in the province of kanchanaburi,  I quickly realize that the true essence\
  \ of Thailand is not nearly what they  talk about in movies and the Internet. I\
  \ was welcomed at the school where I was volunteering to teach English like I was\
  \ part of their family. All the children are always so excited to learn new things\
  \ from me. I couldn\u2019t help but feel emotional from all the real unconditional\
  \ love that I was receiving. \nI could see that despite being what we call on our\
  \ side of the world, poor, they lived by one phrase that was so powerful to me,\
  \ I even tattooed it on my body: \u201CMai Pen Rai\u201D. \nBefore arriving in Thailand,\
  \ I worried about everything. I was a ball of western stress. I tended to get easily\
  \ annoyed and frustrated, but now, I think most people wouldn\u2019t even recognize\
  \ me.  After coming back, everything that troubled me and bothered me before simply\
  \ doesn\u2019t because I learned to whisper silently \u201CMai Pen Rai\u201D just\
  \ like Thai people would do.  It doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re walking\
  \ around with holes in your socks, you didn\u2019t make the quota of the day, you\
  \ smashed your rear window into a tree and now you have to spend money to fix it,\
  \ you didn\u2019t understand the English lesson,  you\u2019ve fallen and scraped\
  \ your knee, or things just simply weren\u2019t going quite right, simply say these\
  \ lovely calming words and you realize that it really doesn\u2019t matter because\
  \  what truly matters in life is just that, life."
