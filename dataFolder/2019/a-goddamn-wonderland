Text: "My feet were icicles, and my heart pumped profusely. Salty liquid dripped down\
  \ my face and blisters formed on my hands and feet. Eight days in Mount Rainier's\
  \ crevices, and she didn't want to lose her grasp of me. Nearly 90 miles in, I held\
  \ my breath with fear.   \n\nPlanning for an adventure takes time, effort, and dedication.\
  \ Necessities that had to be accounted for to survive: food, clothing, shelter,\
  \ fire, boots, liquor, and maps. The campsites for our calling included Mowich Lake,\
  \ Dick Creek, Sunrise, Summerland, Maple Creek, Pyramid Creek, South Puyallup, Golden\
  \ Lakes, and back to Mowich Lake. \n\nThe landscape presented before us was a painting\
  \ brimming with colors: green from the pine trees, brown from the dirt and rocks,\
  \ white from the snowcapped mountains and puffy clouds, gray from the granite of\
  \ the mountains, and blue from the sky above. A deep inhale of fresh oxygen entered\
  \ our lungs. A sigh of carbon dioxide with the sounds of ahhhs. We had arrived.\
  \ Beneath heavy packs stuffed with essentials, our feet constantly pounded on the\
  \ dirt below. Suspension bridges to cross, stones to leap over, miles of dirt trail\
  \ to hike, and heat from the suns rays consumed our days. \n\nMeals were a happy\
  \ place. Tortillas filled with hard salami and sharp cheddar cheese grilled to perfection\
  \ on our skillet. Granola bars, peanut butter, and beef jerky were sprinkled throughout\
  \ the day. Our most impressive meal: whole-wheat noodles, a box of tomatoes, parmesan,\
  \ Italian seasonings, and a plastic cup full of red wine. After stocking up with\
  \ more food at the cache a few days later, we leaned forward onto our poles and\
  \ stood like turtles with our shell packs up top. As the days went on, our packs\
  \ gradually grew lighter. \n\nWe were nearing the end of our adventure and had glacial\
  \ streams to cross. A bridge was knocked down, so we had to wade in the water. \"\
  Let's take it slow. One step in front of the other.\" My sandaled feet in the freezing\
  \ water brought a chill up my spine. Without thinking, I moved quickly. \"Fuck!\"\
  \ I lost my footing, and the gushing glacier water took most of my body underneath.\
  \ I went down and slammed my knee into a rock. Ahead of me, my husband threw his\
  \ poles down. The intense grab of his calloused hands saved me from being fully\
  \ submerged. We staggered to solid ground, followed by deep breaths and tears. Most\
  \ of my body and pack was wet, blood ran down my leg, and we were emotionally drained.\
  \ The rest of the group crossed the water cautiously. A successful crossing and\
  \ a sigh of relief rushed over us. \n\nBefore returning to our map for direction,\
  \ we deeply inhaled and put on our hiking boots. We had one more final push; we\
  \ could do this. 2100 foot gain and we could sit in a car. We could take a shower,\
  \ brush the dirt off, and have a load of memories behind us. Building up courage,\
  \ strength, and motivation, we proceeded on. A victorious climb resulted in an air\
  \ fist pump when we reached the top. Looking behind us on the dirt trail, we conquered\
  \ 97 miles and 22,000 feet in elevation gain in 8 days. This trip wasn't just brutally\
  \ exhausting, hard work, and beautiful; it was a goddamn Wonderland."
