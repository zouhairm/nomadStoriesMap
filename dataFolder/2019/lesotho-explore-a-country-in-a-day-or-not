Text: "Living in South Africa all my life, I thought the toughest part of Lesotho\
  \ would be the border post, but that was the least of my concerns. Let's just establish\
  \ from the outset that I grossly underestimated the size of this small patch on\
  \ the map. It was only once I crossed the border at Caledonspoort, that I realised\
  \ what I had let myself in for. And here I thought I could explore a whole country\
  \ in a day! The idea is just plain laughable.\n\nFrom an infrastructure perspective,\
  \ despite the tarred roads, there are elements of this country that is very rural.\
  \ The same could be said for South Africa, however so, in essence, it didn't come\
  \ as much of a surprise. What I did realise however, is how much I rely on GPS to\
  \ get around an unfamiliar space.  I literally had no idea how to get from where\
  \ I was, to where I wanted to be.\n\nAfter driving for around an hour and passing\
  \ through small towns and farmland, I found myself at a roadblock. Sitting behind\
  \ a large truck, I couldn't really see what was happening ahead of me so, when the\
  \ truck moved forward, I did too. And I was nearly arrested! Unbeknownst to me,\
  \ I was meant to stay where I was, until the traffic officer summoned me forward.\
  \ I'm pretty sure the only thing that stopped the copy from going ahead with the\
  \ arrest was the fear in my eyes, and the kids I had in the backseat.\n\nOnce I\
  \ had stopped shaking from that near miss, I tried following a few derelict road\
  \ signs and found myself quite hopelessly lost. I initially planned to find the\
  \ Afriski Resort but, after driving for most of the day and seeing nothing but arid\
  \ landscape, I chose to quit while I was ahead. After popping in briefly at a loom\
  \ and felt-making store, I headed for the next available border post and drove back\
  \ into South Africa. \n\nI can't tell you how relived I was to be back in the land\
  \ of GPS and familiar-ish territory. We entered Lesotho at Caledonspoort near Fouriesberg,\
  \ and exited at Peka Bridge, near Ficksburg. So, in essence, we barely explored\
  \ about 2% of Lesotho and that took us a good 6 hours. Never again will I underestimate\
  \ a country again, or take GPS for granted. You truly don't know what you've got,\
  \ until it's gone.\n\nPutting that disappointment aside, we took the opportunity\
  \ to explore Ficksberg instead and, even though this town is famed for it's Cherry\
  \ Festival once a year, and we weren't there at the right time, it is still beautiful\
  \ and the Constantia Cherry Farmstall is delightful. It has something for everyone\
  \ and is a great place to stop if you are looking for something delicious to eat.\
  \ It is a forgone conclusion that you will stock up on all things cherry related.\
  \ Even things you didn't know could be cherry related. \n\nThe sun was just setting\
  \ as we arrived back at our rooms for the night, and we were absolutely exhausted.\
  \ After a hurried dinner, we fell into bed to dream about children taking care of\
  \ their family wealth in cattle, and local Lesotho people completely their daily\
  \ errands, while riding on horseback. What an epic adventure!"
