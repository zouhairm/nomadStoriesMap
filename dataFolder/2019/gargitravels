Text: "Mexico City is one best kept secrets of Mexico. It is a gem for explorers.\
  \ Travelers usually opt for the beach destinations of Mexico like Cancun, Tulum\
  \ and usually neglect Mexico City may be because of the city\u2019s overwhelming\
  \ size and population but this city has something to offer to everyone. Whether\
  \ you like history or are passionate about art, or simply looking for some adventure\
  \ you will not regret your decision of choosing Mexico city.\n\nThe major attractions\
  \ of the city include -  the Chapultepec area, the Anthropology Museum, Metropolitan\
  \ Cathedral, the National Palace, Palace of Fine Arts and the pyramids of Teotihuacan.\
  \ \n\nDay 1 - Pyramids of Teotihuacan\n\nTeotihuacan Pyramids\nThere are two trips\
  \ - morning and afternoon offered by websites like Tripadvisor.com and Viator.com.\
  \ I  chose the early morning trip which commences at 6:30 a.m. to beat the heat\
  \ and midday crowds. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. I did climb the stairs\
  \ to the top of Sun and Moon Pyramid to get breath-taking panoramic views of the\
  \ surroundings.\n\nYou may take an Uber to the pyramids as well if you like to tour\
  \ the pyramids on your own. Uber fares are super cheap in Mexico city compared to\
  \ any other North American city.\n\n\nPanoramic view of the site captured from the\
  \ top of Sun Pyramid\nDay 2 Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul, Xochimilco & Coyoacan\n\nHouse\
  \ of Frida Kahlo\nRenowned artist Frida Kahlo was born in Casa Azul which is now\
  \ converted into a museum for the tourists. The house displays some of the finest\
  \ work of Frida Kahlon in the form of paintings and art work. Some displays are\
  \ telling stories of her painful life. Kahlo's art is a clear depiction of anguish\
  \ of her existential being. \n\nTip: Visit the Museum during early hours to avoid\
  \ the crowds especially on weekends.\n\n\nXochimilco\nI coupled Day 2 with a trip\
  \ to  Xochimilco & Coyoacan and enjoyed the boat ride through the canals of Xochimilco.\
  \ Eating local tacos and drinking local beer on the boat was an experience in itself.\
  \ \n\nDay3\nI started my day by visiting the iconic Angel of Independence landmark.\
  \ Later checked out the National Anthropology Musuem, Museo Tamayo and the National\
  \ Museum of Art. Chapultepec Castle is a beautiful majestic castle on top of a hill.\
  \ Later half of the day, spent some time at the Basilica of Our lady, National Palace\
  \ (or Palacio Nacional) which is located in Mexico City\u2019s main square, is best\
  \ known for the magnificent murals painted by the famous Mexican artist, Diego Rivera.\
  \ I highly recommend buying tickets for the Mexican folk dance performed everyday\
  \ at the Palacio de Bellas Artes.\n\nAt night I visited the famous \"Torre LatinoAmericana\"\
  \ which was once the largest sky-scraper in Mexico where I witnessed spectacular\
  \ views of the city from the observation deck at the 44th-floor."
