Text: "I am not a writer. Or maybe I am. I have been involved in science for my whole\
  \ adult life and somehow I learned to write and read about people and nature without\
  \ actually connecting with people and nature.  How strange isn't? During my scientific\
  \ training I had the chance to break that circle touching the soul of many wonderful\
  \ persons through food. I was living far home, as most of my life, and one common\
  \ aspect I realized is that wherever people go, the food goes with them. \nThis\
  \ is story of a nomad apprentice. It starts in Italy while I was doing my PhD, living\
  \ in  a students house called Copernico (couldn't be more inspiring), with three\
  \ hundred more people and only two kitchens to share. My friend Adam who teach me\
  \ to value of the slow food, didn't have the patience to go every night and wait\
  \ for the turn to cook something in the two-burner stove. I did, although at first\
  \ it was boring to go without him. One of the two kitchens was occupied by Italians\
  \ who couldn't stand spicy smells. The other was the paradise of exotic flavours\
  \ of the rest of the world. \nFrom the 300 people living in the residence, I could\
  \ say that at least forty percent were foreings, and of course that forty percent\
  \ was taking their food to that kitchen at the corner of Copernico.\nI never got\
  \ to cook one single dish in that kitchen. It was to slow to wait until the Indians\
  \ could end preparing their super delicious meals.  While I waited I used to learn\
  \ about what they cooked. I listened to their stories and I wrote, or better to\
  \ say... They wrote. Indians, Chinese, Italians, Pakistan is, Egyptians and many\
  \ more. They shared with me their precious secrets about how to make a good dish,\
  \ a dish of memories from home, from the flavors of the beloved ones or the moments\
  \ of a day of happiness. \nBut I not only visited Copernico's kitchen. I travelled\
  \ a lot during my PhD and every time I did it , I took my book with me and ask to\
  \ the great people I met for a new recipe, no matter how simple or complicated could\
  \ be, no matter the language or the writing. I only wanted to take with me a little\
  \ piece of their memories  to honor them when I open my book to read, or even best,\
  \ to cook.\nAdam never gave me a recipe despite we shared a countless number of\
  \ meals. I still wait to catch-up for the chance to get one and start a new book."
