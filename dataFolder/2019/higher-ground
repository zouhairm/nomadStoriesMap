Text: "\u201CWhat\u2019s holding you back?\u201D It\u2019s Monday morning, 9am, and\
  \ I\u2019m in my weekly counselling session. The question drills through to my core.\
  \ It demands I put in to words a feeling I\u2019ve come to experience over the past\
  \ year. It also takes me back vividly to the physical sensation of standing on the\
  \ edge of a rocky outlet, peering into the oh so turquoise blue waters of one of\
  \ Mexico\u2019s magical cenotes.  \n My love affair with the Americas began in 2004\
  \ when I saw the film \u2018The Motorcycle Diaries\u2019. Throughout my twenties,\
  \ I dreamed of travelling through quaint villages, stopping off to sample local\
  \ dishes and improve my schoolgirl Spanish. However, the life of a jobbing actress\
  \ doesn\u2019t always facilitate big adventures and my dream remained a dream. Until\
  \ last year that is, when, growing increasingly frustrated by the feeling that I\
  \ was stagnating in grey London, that I was letting life all too easily pass me\
  \ by, I wrote a list of everything I REALLY wanted to do. Writing, directing a film,\
  \ learning to dance, getting therapy \u2026travel. Holding the list close to my\
  \ chest, I plotted a firm course through 2018 and prayed the stars would align and\
  \ lead me to my dream destination by the end of the year.\nA message flashes up\
  \ on my phone as I\u2019m making my way through Cancun airport, three days before\
  \ New Year. It\u2019s from Dad. \u201CTake great care with any water-based activities.\u201D\
  \ Two minutes later, another message. \u201CMake sure you do lots of water-based\
  \ activities and send some extreme selfies please,\u201D my brother chimes in. Pocketing\
  \ my phone and family advice, I take a moment to contemplate what it is that\u2019\
  s brought me here and the adventure I\u2019m about to embark on, encountering the\
  \ land of the Maya through Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. Why am I doing this particular\
  \ trip? What do I want to do? What is it I\u2019m searching for, or hoping to discover?\
  \ Twenty-four hours later, I\u2019m with the group I\u2019ll be travelling with\
  \ for the next three weeks. I\u2019m expectant, ready, and I recognise that what\
  \ I desire is to dive in to the unknown.\nThe thought ripples through my mind again\
  \ a day later as I sit watching people jump from the high ledge in to the azure\
  \ pool of the cenote below. \u2018Cenote\u2019, our guide tells us, means \u2018\
  sacred well\u2019. They are created as limestone erodes over millions of years to\
  \ reveal freshwater pools below; the Mayans believed they were portals to a higher\
  \ world. A figure in stripes stands at the top, and as my eyes focus, I see it\u2019\
  s my new friend Tam. Her body turns so her back is facing the water and with a brief\
  \ look back, she flips backwards through the air, turning gracefully and precisely,\
  \ landing with a defiant splash, into the blue water below. Something stirs in me.\
  \ I want to do that. Before I know it, I\u2019m climbing the steps up, and walking\
  \ with purpose to the staging area.  I look out, and take a step. However, my body\
  \ starts to tense up, and fear takes hold. As I look out, all I suddenly see now\
  \ is danger, risk and recognition that I\u2019m a long way from what I know.\n\u201C\
  What\u2019s holding you back?\u201D The counsellor\u2019s  words go around in my\
  \ head. When I begin to recount the story of that day, I remember that moments after\
  \ those initial fearful thoughts, Tam\u2019s voice sounded from behind me. \u201C\
  Go on Luce. You\u2019ve got this! Jump. It\u2019s really fun. You won\u2019t regret\
  \ it.\u201D There, on the ledge high above the beautiful cenote, I acknowledged\
  \ my fear, but  chose to jump in to the unknown. Reflecting on that moment and its\
  \ greater significance, I realise I took a leap of faith in myself and my potential\
  \ for greatness, and my, how glorious it felt. Freefalling, spinning, crashing,\
  \ splashing, submerging... I emerge, in to the fresh light of the day, and the delight\
  \ of the new."
