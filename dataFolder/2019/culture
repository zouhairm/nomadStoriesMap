Text: "Everyone loves to travel, especially, if you have the financing. I am a sociologist\
  \ from India and I have found out my recent love for photography. I chose sociology\
  \ as my research area not just because I like it but also because it gives me chance\
  \ to travel and understand people. I am intrigued my people living in the remotest\
  \ of areas but still living in harmony with nature. \nI had a chance to go on one\
  \ such trip in India, Himachal Pardesh. This state is called the adobe of gods with\
  \ serene beauty of mountains covered with snow. We hicked for 5 hours before we\
  \ reached the mountain top to see vast green land surrounded by still higher mountains.\
  \ We camped there for the night enjoying the chilling wind and clear night sky.\
  \  Devoid of electricity, phone network and internet and preparing our own food\
  \ was an amazing experience. \nI got a chance to use my friends camera and surprisingly,\
  \ the photos turned out pretty well. After since this trip, I loved to travel more,\
  \ partly because I want to travel and see beautiful scenes, artifacts and monuments\
  \ and partly because I love to capture them which gives me a chance to post them\
  \ on my instagram handle."
