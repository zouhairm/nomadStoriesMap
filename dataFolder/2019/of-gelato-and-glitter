Text: "I always find it best to just wander. I don't enjoy planning \u2013 I never\
  \ have, really. The sweltering, dense summer heat reflecting of the Roman pavement\
  \ that day had sent us on our current mission; the great gelato hunt. It didn't\
  \ even have to be very good. Even the grainiest, iciest one would do.\n\nAfter an\
  \ hour of walking in the sun, we finally found a spot, ordered our incredibly creamy\
  \ and satisfying treats (salted caramel for me, pistachio for my wife) and sat in\
  \ the wonderfully air-conditioned shop, which must have been like what heaven feels\
  \ like, I thought. \n\nAs we cooled down, we discussed what our next course of action\
  \ would be. Maybe we could walk to the Colosseum, maybe see some pretty fountains\
  \ along the way, and stop for a plate of ravioli or spaghetti. The typical things\
  \ one might do on a jaunt through the Roman cobblestone streets.\n\nWe must have\
  \ still been under the effects of the heat, because I could have sworn that I saw\
  \ a pirate carrying a penis-shaped sword through the gelateria windows. That's not\
  \ the kind of thing one normally sees on the renaissance-like streets of Rome, I\
  \ remember thinking to myself. After interrogating the shop owner and remembering\
  \ the rainbow coloured posters we barely glanced at on our way, we decided what\
  \ we would do with the rest of our day. \n\nI had never been to a gay pride parade\
  \ before. I had my own preconceived notion of what it might be like from pictures,\
  \ and movies, and stories I heard from my friends, but I didn't really understand\
  \ what it would really be like.\n\nWe left the gelato shop, back into the oppressive\
  \ heat, and immediately heard the electronic beats from a mile away, beckoning us\
  \ like the pied piper. The closer we got, the more colorful and vibrant the normally\
  \ brown undertones of Rome became. The people, too, became more vibrant, washing\
  \ away the regular tourist drab with outfits set to celebrate. \n\nAs we approached\
  \ the parade, it was everything I expected and more. Thousands of people gathered,\
  \ despite the heat, which was only made worse by scantily clad men and women rubbing\
  \ their skin against their equally scant brethren. It was truly an oxymoron against\
  \ the old city of Rome; sparkling men and women adorned the floats, usually decorated\
  \ with one glittery genital or another. A fire truck passed by, spraying the watching\
  \ crowd with water; this was more relief than any gelato could ever bring.\n\nPeople\
  \ of all shapes, sizes, colours, and orientations continued parading through the\
  \ streets, ignoring the sun. Across the parade from us, an Islamic church group\
  \ held a sign, \"Allah accepts everyone.\" The beauty of this statement brought\
  \ an enormous amount of attention and love. This was what the day was about. Acceptance.\
  \ I wasn't thinking about ice cream anymore. I thought now, this must really be\
  \ what heaven feels like.\n\nI originally went to Rome to experience the history,\
  \ the ancient Roman architecture. The image I left with was a different side of\
  \ the city, a more modern side, with people celebrating their rights, their accomplishments\
  \ and their heritage. There is a tendency when travelling to forget the people that\
  \ are living their everyday lives. For me, this was an opportunity to see through\
  \ the tourist magic and see a much more real side of Italy that was, in my opinion,\
  \ much more magical."
