Text: "You wouldn\u2019t believe me if I said it took 5 times for me to get to Senegal.\
  \ But belief and faith in something greater than yourself can go a very long way.\
  \ \nBefore my first attempt of going to Senegal, my dad called my sister and I to\
  \ wish us blessings and a safe flight. He then said, \"Oh...and I have to tell you\
  \ that you will be meeting your family. You have a very big family, you know, you\
  \ got some aunts, uncles, your granddaddy, some siblings\u2026\u201D\nOn Monday,\
  \ December 29th, 2015 at 4:47 p.m. I found out that my father got remarried and\
  \ had four more children back in Senegal. Two stepmoms. 3 girls. 1 boy.\nI arrived\
  \ in Senegal after 5 trying times on June 20th in 2016. I thought that I knew so\
  \ much about the world but I realized I barely knew myself. You see, Senegal is\
  \ a peculiar place to live in because it is very traditional and very religious,\
  \ yet everyone expresses themselves so freely. As a daughter of an African-American\
  \ mother and Senegalese father, my sense of identity was continuously questioned\
  \ during the entire trip. Teranga is hospitality and it is all encompassing: food,\
  \ music, dance, religion, language, history and so much more. I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find myself in Senegal but that is exactly what happened.\nThe first day I\
  \ landed, it was difficult for me to take everything in. There is a rushing sense\
  \ to Senegal. People talking, laughing, hustling, working, learning. The non-stop\
  \ bustle of it all was overwhelming but I loved every moment: I felt anew. I studied\
  \ abroad at the University of Dakar. I had the chance to stay with my family in\
  \ Dakar for my time there and also visit cities such as Touba, St. Louis, Ndem,\
  \ Popenguine, Thi\xE8s, and Joal-Fadiouth. Touba was my re-defining moment.\nI was\
  \ packing to leave and I recall telling my Aunt Issa that I didn\u2019t know what\
  \ to expect. I didn\u2019t know how my siblings would react towards me. How would\
  \ I react towards them? \nThe trip was 4-5 hours. Jidi would pick up people on the\
  \ way and drop them off to wherever they needed to go. Dirt roads, foreign towns,\
  \ random mosques. Finally, we reached the house. I was getting out of the car and\
  \ I was greeted by my first cousin, Diarra. \nIt was a big house. Set up like a\
  \ complex. White, archway entry and very humid. The living room was really hot,\
  \ but this was a different type of heat. It was the type of heat you feel when you\
  \ go down south to your great uncle\u2019s house and see red clay on the side of\
  \ the road. Muggy. \nI was standing amongst family members who I didn\u2019t know.\
  \ I shook everybody\u2019s hand in the room but I noticed a little girl. She was\
  \ skinny and had some height on her but I could tell she was young. She looked really\
  \ excited but I didn\u2019t know who she was.\nDiarra turned to me and said, \u201C\
  This is Fama. She is your sister.\u201D As soon as she said that, I ran to her and\
  \ hugged her. I held her so close to me. I never felt this type of emotion before.\
  \ I was crying but I didn\u2019t want anybody to see me cry. I was happy, mad, sad,\
  \ everything rushed at once. I discretely wiped my tears as I was holding on to\
  \ Fama. And then I met my other sisters. And I realized that I wasn\u2019t the youngest\
  \ anymore. In that moment, I had a responsibility to take on. \nThat night, Fama,\
  \ Diarra, Adja and I slept in the living room. They told me that I could sleep in\
  \ my dad\u2019s room and how nice it was all set up for me but it just didn\u2019\
  t feel right. So, I decided to be right with my sister and cousins. We took pictures,\
  \ we danced, we laughed. It was unreal, yet so authentic. It was as if that night\
  \ was destined to happen. No matter how upset one might think I should have been,\
  \ all of my happiness spread throughout that household. Pure, genuine happiness:\
  \ teranga."
