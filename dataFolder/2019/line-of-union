Text: "It took us an one-hour train ride from central London to the North Greenwich\
  \ station. I didn't mind though \u2014because my city doesn't have the underground\
  \ system of transportation, every ride on the tube was full of joy and sparks. I'm\
  \ sure my parents and my younger sister felt the same, despite how crowded it was\
  \ or how much time we would spend inside the tube carriage. \n\nWe arrived around\
  \ 1pm. It was a blue-sky kind of day, no clouds, in a city famous for its fog and\
  \ rain. The neighbourhood was very calm, quite the opposite from what we saw during\
  \ the past few days in Westminster. Few people on the street, mainly locals; children\
  \ wearing their school uniforms; many green areas and no tall buildings. \n\nOur\
  \ intention was to visit a known historical site, the type you read on your school\
  \ Geography books. In my early 20s, I remembered studying about how a simple line\
  \ on the floor serves as reference for calculating distances in lengths and establishing\
  \ time zones. Simple as that. And my parents obviously remembered it too, since\
  \ that tour was their idea. \n\nBut no signs would tell us which way to follow to\
  \ reach our destination. We walked for quite a long time, about 40 minutes or so,\
  \ and stopped all kind of people we would find on the streets \u2014a mom with her\
  \ toddler, an elderly couple, a guard\u2014 to ask how to get to the Greenwich Meridian.\
  \ But none of them knew where it was. Or what it was. \n\nHow was that even possible?\
  \ Did this line really exist?\n\nIt was settled then: if we could not find the place\
  \ in another thirty minutes, we would go back to the station and do a last-minute\
  \ plan for that afternoon. The British Library maybe? That's when I had the insight.\
  \ Not far from us, a bus stop. A few steps later and a two-minute wait in that comfortable\
  \ grey bench, we gave a signal to the first bus to appear. 53 to Whitehall.\n\n\u201C\
  Hello, sir. Please, do you know how to get to the Greenwich Meridian?\u201D I asked\
  \ the bus driver, for what it seemed like the thousandth time that day.\n\n\u201C\
  Hop-on! Five more stops and you get off on Greenwich Park,\u201D he answered gladly.\n\
  \nAt the park, the first impression was an \u201Coh, is that it?\u201D. I'm not\
  \ denying that it is a beautiful park, it's one of the largest I've been to. But\
  \ one lady riding a bicycle here, one guy reading there. Overall, empty. We were\
  \ really starting to doubt the existence of that line. \n\nAs we neared the Observatory\
  \ however, I noticed that the amount of people only increased. A good sign, at last.\
  \ A superb building, brown bricks and white windows. And an astonishing, breathtaking\
  \ view of the city. We could see everything from there. But people's attention was\
  \ focused on something else, as well as ours. \n\nAt the end of a very long queue\
  \ at the bottom of the building, behind a small metal gate, was the Greenwich Meridian!\n\
  \nPeople were taking a bunch of pictures, from the most varied angles. Making the\
  \ funniest poses while one feet was positioned on the West side of the world, and\
  \ the other one on the East. Or just talking and smiling to each other, waiting\
  \ for their turn to do the same. And whilst I waited too, I came to realize much\
  \ more than I actually had expected to find there.\n\nThe Greenwich Meridian isn't\
  \ about calculation and time zones only, nor the division of the West world from\
  \ the East world.  \n\nThat golden line on the floor brought together Japanese,\
  \ Argentinian, French, South African, Indian, Chilean, Spanish, Chinese, Canadian...\
  \ People from West and East sharing one single place and interacting in the most\
  \ civilised and amicable way; at that time, not caring about any segregation at\
  \ all.\n\nProbably not all people there had the same realization I did at the moment.\
  \ In fact, who knew that an apparently simple ride during our holidays could give\
  \ me so much hope.\n\nHope of a better, peaceful world."
