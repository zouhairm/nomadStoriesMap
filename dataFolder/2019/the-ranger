Text: "\u201CGive me the camera!\u201D He yelled, waving a knife towards my best friend.\
  \ Adrian - who had the camera \u2013 looked shell-shocked. \nI imagined my eyes\
  \ mirrored the same fear. \nThe knife swished in closer. \n\u201CGive him the camera!\u201D\
  \ I thought I cried out. I can\u2019t remember in the momentary disorientation though\
  \ if I\u2019d said anything at all, or if Adrian himself had tossed the camera to\
  \ the mugger without my input. \nIt was like what you see in the movies, where the\
  \ group of friends get mugged, and in slow motion you see the camera being caught\
  \ from mid-air, and then suddenly the scene speeds up again where the thief would\
  \ rush off towards his partners and out of sight. \nThe walk up to the car park\
  \ was blurred and strained, simply not knowing what to do, as surrounding tourists\
  \ who had witnessed the event asked us is we were okay. Then came the realisation\
  \ after, that two of my friends had gotten slashed by the knife. \nThe stark irony\
  \ of two distinct feelings \u2013 gratefulness for our life, and the shock the incident\
  \ had happened at all \u2013 was numbing.\nWe made the call to the police station.\
  \ The time we waited for their arrival to file the report was the quietest we\u2019\
  d been on our holiday. Once their police wagon rolled up, the officers ushered us\
  \ into a beaten down dim-lit room, where we gave report, all of us with different\
  \ versions to this haunting encounter. \nThen the Ranger came in. \nIt\u2019s been\
  \ one year since the incident, and the four of us still feel grateful for Ranger\
  \ Aslam Levy. \nHe looked at us sympathetically as we told the story. \n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s the first time that I\u2019ve even heard of this happening at Signal Hill. Especially\
  \ at midday!\u201D He remarked, concern creasing his elderly face. The police murmured\
  \ their comments on the same, and continued taking notes. \n\u201CHow long are you\
  \ guys in Cape Town for?\u201D he asked us, and I noted his strong South African\
  \ accent before responding to his question. \n\u201CWell, just two days left. I\
  \ don\u2019t want you guys to have a bad impression of this beautiful city. What\
  \ are your plans for the rest of the day?\u201D\n\u201CWe\u2019d wanted to take\
  \ the hike up Table Mountain; the Platteklip Gorge route.\_Although I think now\
  \ we\u2019d agreed to take the cable car up,\u201D I told him with a wry smile.\
  \ \n \u201CWell, I\u2019ll take you guys up on a trek around the top of the Table\
  \ Mountain. Why don\u2019t we all head over to the cable car station?\u201D\nPerhaps\
  \ it was because we were in the aftershock of being mugged. There was this feeling\
  \ that bubbled up, of utter gratitude, that humanity was still out there. We couldn\u2019\
  t help but agree to his hospitality, and the day progressed from there. \nAs the\
  \ cable car approached the top of Table Mountain, we were met with a magical mist-covered\
  \ landscape. There was a slight drizzle that added to the allure, although given\
  \ these surroundings, the aerial view of Cape Town was a no-show. Our adventure\
  \ over the next three hours disregarded this fact though. From learning about the\
  \ flora and fauna at the top of the mountain, to the shared anecdotes that made\
  \ us laugh out loud, to experiencing the natural wonder that Table Mountain is,\
  \ Ranger Aslam made our experience at the top of Table Mountain a memorable one.\
  \ \nLooking back at the memory of this mini expedition, the highlight had been when\
  \ we\u2019d been at a viewpoint towards the end of the Platteklip Gorge route. The\
  \ rain had increased fivefold, and Ranger Aslam requested us to proceed with caution\
  \ as to not slip. In that moment, we had been surrounded by the cold, steadily getting\
  \ drenched, and enclosed with a rocky and cloud-covered scene that was truly breath-taking.\n\
  In this entire experience, the cheerfulness and wit of Ranger Aslam was exactly\
  \ what we\u2019d needed to put our mugging incident behind us, and to this day,\
  \ no anecdote of our journey to South Africa is complete without talking about him.\
  \ We are so incredibly thankful to him for the memories he gave us on our visit\
  \ to Cape Town."
