Text: "Kodaikanal is a small hill town located in Dindigul district in the South Indian\
  \ state of Tamil Nadu. Rich with a wide variety of flora and fauna, it serves as\
  \ a getaway from the sweltering heat that the southern parts of India are generally\
  \ used to. There is something here for everyone. In fact, over the recent years,\
  \ the tourism sector has seen a steady rise in the number of younger tourists, both\
  \ from different states in India, and from places abroad because of one very specific\
  \ thing, the 'Magic Mushrooms', which contain naturally occurring hallucinogens\
  \ called psilocybin. However, this story is not about those. It's about a happiness\
  \ of a different kind altogether.\nThere are many popular trekking points in Kodaikanal.\
  \ One of these is a short one kilometre trek to a location called 'Dolphin's Nose'.\
  \ To reach this place, which offers an amazing view, one has to walk through a moderately\
  \ rough terrain. The path has towering trees on both sides, which provide shade\
  \ and let you feel the thrill of walking directly in the heart of the wilderness.\
  \ If you are lucky you might even spot a bison on the other side of the fence! I\
  \ first went to Kodaikanal in November 2017, and this trek was one of the few that\
  \ my friend and I decided to experience. This trek, as mentioned earlier, isn\u2019\
  t the most difficult, but it can provide pretty challenging, especially to the people\
  \ who are not used to trekking on rough terrains. The path can be a little tricky\
  \ owing to the fact that it is basically worn down rocks covered with overgrown\
  \ roots forming a pathway. \nNovember is the end of monsoons in Kodaikanal. This\
  \ meant that the town was still experiencing sparse showers from time to time. In\
  \ fact, it was raining even while we were there. Now, this is of importance because\
  \ the sporadic rainfall had made the already difficult trek even more treacherous.\
  \ The rocky, downhill path that was already covered in moss owing to the downpours\
  \ throughout monsoon was now also wet and slippery. We had to be very careful about\
  \ where we were stepping. While walking through this path in a very careful and\
  \ calculated manner, my friend suddenly spotted a bundle of fur sitting on a rock\
  \ a little distance away. It was a beautiful calico cat, staring at us very intently.\
  \ Being avid animal enthusiasts, we tried to lure the cat closer. To our surprise,\
  \ she was more than willing to come closer, and was even started purring contently\
  \ when we pet her. After playing with her for a little while, we thought we would\
  \ get on with our trek, and we tried to say goodbye to the cat. However, to our\
  \ pleasant surprise, it seemed that the cat had decided to give us company through\
  \ our trek. Believe it or not, she walked ahead confidently, jumping with ease through\
  \ the simplest way possible. All we had to do was follow her. She led us through\
  \ more than two thirds of the trek, till we reached a point where it was more or\
  \ less a straight downhill road, instead of a rocky terrain. We had heard of dogs\
  \ who help people navigate through difficult paths, but it was a novelty seeing\
  \ a cat helping us out in such a way. \nWhile returning back, I was secretly hoping\
  \ that we would find the cat somewhere along the path and pet it some more. To be\
  \ honest, it was the biggest motivator that kept me going through the tiring uphill\
  \ climb. To our pleasant surprise, we found the cat near the place where she had\
  \ left us, guiding some more people down. She seemed rather happy to see us again,\
  \ and decided to walk back up with us. The trek is still one of my happiest memories.\n\
  Animals have a very beautiful way of touching us, even when we least expect. This\
  \ was one such instance, where we found a random cat helping out some random people.\
  \ She appeared to be well fed, and was not looking for any treats. She was just\
  \ looking for love, and I know she found it in plenty."
