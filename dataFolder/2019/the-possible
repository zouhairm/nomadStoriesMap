Text: "The sweat trapped between my legs and the cushion is starting to cause heat\
  \ rash. I shift in the chair, trying to create a temporary air gap, but there is\
  \ no comfort from the midday Mexican heat. It doesn\u2019t matter though, I\u2019\
  m nearly there. \nLooking down into the vast water-filled cavern, bright, hanging\
  \ foliage points the way from the small opening at the top into the darkness below.\
  \ A sun shaft creates a spotlight of bright green-blue, a shadow puppet show on\
  \ the water in the perfect shape of the fissure above. In the dim, reflected light,\
  \ I also see the roughly hewn steps that fill me with dread. \n\u201CIt\u2019s no\
  \ problem\u201D, says Pablo the cenote custodian, as he stubs out his cigarette,\
  \ looking me up and down. \nI squint at him doubtfully. He is far shorter than me\
  \ and probably in his sixties. I\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s up to this, but swimming\
  \ in an obscure cenote, away from gaggles of tourists, is what I am here for. I\
  \ nod. He helps me up from my wheelchair, wrapping my arms over the shoulders of\
  \ his prickly, collarless shirt, and starts to half carry, half support me down\
  \ the uneven steps.\n \nI left Scotland for a month of travel, armed only with a\
  \ folding off-road wheelchair, a ten kilo backpack (the heaviest I can hang on the\
  \ back of the chair without it tipping over) and a small clip-on motor. I drop in\
  \ to see my mother on the way to the airport. Her nervous face says it all; disabled\
  \ people don\u2019t do this kind of thing, not alone. At that point I don\u2019\
  t know, perhaps she is right, but I need to keep travelling. I can\u2019t stop,\
  \ not just because of multiple sclerosis, and I need to travel alone this time.\
  \ One in five people have some sort of disability. I need to see if I can do it.\n\
  \ \nArriving in Central America with broken Spanish and an aching body, I am anxious,\
  \ wondering if I've made a huge mistake. Sitting alone in the first guesthouse,\
  \ the doubts swirl around me in an overwhelming fog. I try and focus on the cracks\
  \ in the walls. There are so many things I want to do. I want to go up a volcano\
  \ but it seems impossible, unless... \n\"No problem\", Rafael, a tour guide says,\
  \ hiring a horse for me. \nThe horse takes me up to the eerie, ash-filled landscapes\
  \ at the top of the live volcano, its breath mixing with the lava smoke. It's beautiful.\
  \ I can't stop grinning, this is normal here. The majority of hotels, buses and\
  \ tour organisers are all saying the same; they will find a way.\nI'm offered an\
  \ unofficial lift with Tikal national park rangers in a dilapidated pick-up truck.\
  \ Driving around the mesmerising, sculptural Mayan ruins that break defiantly through\
  \ the jungle canopy, we chat non-stop about our lives, families and their endangered\
  \ Mayan heritage, cherished conversations that make me grateful that I wasn\u2019\
  t able to do an organised walking tour. In Belize, I snorkel with stingrays and\
  \ sharks, helped by a boat tour owner with a passion for reef protection who lends\
  \ me a body float. In Mexico, a backstreet restaurant finds me a ramp from nowhere\
  \ and I eat the best seafood ceviche I\u2019ve ever had, the sweet, spicy, and unbelievably\
  \ fresh taste created by the local limes and coriander. Still savouring the flavour,\
  \ I ask the staff about cenotes.\n \nPablo is stronger than he looks and, step by\
  \ step, we finally arrive at the cenote base. I look up, exhausted, and smile. The\
  \ cave is a dappled impressionist painting of green flora on a cool grey rock canvas,\
  \ its vivid green-blue centrepiece still sitting in the water under the unwavering\
  \ sunlight shaft. Lowering myself into the depths the coolness soothes my body.\
  \ I float towards the light and relax. The landscapes, food and architecture may\
  \ be what I came for, but here in the silence, weightless and full of faith in humanity,\
  \ I can hear the voices of the many strangers encountered, often just for a few\
  \ minutes, who all said \u201Cno problem\u201D and made the impossible, possible."
