Text: "Has anybody ever slapped you with kindness? No? Good God, because America gave\
  \ me such a strong \u201Ckind\u201D slap, that even sitting in Ukraine, I still\
  \ can`t get over it. When at the age of 16 I boarded the plane that would bring\
  \ me to place so unknown and wanted, I couldn`t even imagine I`d be another person\
  \ in a year. Three, two, one... Hello, my new life and old fears.\t\n\tThe plane\
  \ landed, and I closed my eyes for a second to realize I`m here. Yes, I am: in Ukraine\
  \ we don`t have such a clear sky sliced with thin clouds, so it`s definitely America.\
  \ I always tried not to \u201Cworship\u201D the places where I was going, but here,\
  \ in the Unites States, I couldn`t do anything with myself. Green road signs, smiling\
  \ people and something inexpressible in the air. All my fears, dreams, desires mixed\
  \ in those invisible American vibes that made me so happy. I opened the window of\
  \ the car I was riding and laughed so loudly that a woman on the side of the road\
  \ looked at me and smiled. America, here I come!\n\tA year on the other continent\
  \ completely changed my world-view. You know, it`s like you put some cereal in a\
  \ bowl, pour milk on it and then accidentally flip your meal. I was that bowl and\
  \ America flipped me several times for sure. \n\tI lived in Virginia with my host-family,\
  \ and this state was so natural and \u201Csincere\u201D to everybody that I`d hug\
  \ Virginia if it was a human. Golden fields, flat roads, coffee in my big blue mug.\
  \ Those were the vibes of all mornings spent there. Going to American High School\
  \ at 7 am was full of my host-mom`s jokes and old songs playing from a car radio.\
  \ Every day I was magically turning to a real American teenager that was wearing\
  \ cool pants, gossiping a little with other girls and jumping in cheerleading club.\
  \ Oh, cheerleading! That was a hobby of my life. Seemed like America breathed through\
  \ those sparkling cheer-shirts, pom-poms and snow-white smiles of girls. My coaches\
  \ taught me everything and thanks to them, I visited so many cities on competitions\
  \ days. \n\tBut my year wasn`t limited only by Virginia`s borders. \n\tWashington\
  \ DC. I lived only an hour away from the capital, so my visits were often and emotional.\
  \ Washington looked a lot like my dear Kyiv, but had that strong American spirit\
  \ any excellent writer can`t describe. I trembled in front of Lincoln Memorial,\
  \ danced near Washington Monument that was as far as the eyes could see, walked\
  \ around the White House with face of a future president and tried to catch ducks\
  \ on a lake. Was I happy? More than. Was it enough for my adventure-seeking soul?\
  \ Of course not, so I went to the \u201CCity of the Yellow Devil\u201D or, saying\
  \ simply, New York.\n\tNew York met me with the \u201Cscreaming\u201D bill boards\
  \ and freaky people (yeah, my favorite type of people, I`m loving it). I had four\
  \ days to reach its heart and take a piece of it with me. Wide streets pretentiously\
  \ laughed at me and I laughed back, walking to a Times Square. I was eating strawberries\
  \ bought on a side-road for 1$. Everybody was in its personal hurry and pushed me\
  \ with shoulders, and I could feel the pressure of megapolis even more clear. Weird,\
  \ but I liked it. Push me again, please! And again! I`m not a masochist, but New\
  \ York made me love feeling tiny in crowded city. Leaving with the tears in my eyes,\
  \ I promised to be back. One day I`ll come to New York not to feel tiny, but big,\
  \ in all senses of this word. \n\tVirginia Beach. I can tell a lot about this place,\
  \ but I`d like to be quiet right now. Just listen. Do you hear the ocean waves whispering\
  \ you that you`re beautiful? That`s my America, and it tastes a lot better than\
  \ a chocolate candy you`ve just eaten. \n\tIt was not a year in life, but life in\
  \ a year. America gave me a ton of overweight and three tons of ambition. Be fat\
  \ and ambitious, darling."
