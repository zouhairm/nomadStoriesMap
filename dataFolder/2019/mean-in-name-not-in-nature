Text: "We could have gone to Laos, Vietnam, or even Myanmar.  But myself and my partner\
  \ chose Cambodia in the end for our 5-day visa run.  Siem Reap to be exact.\n\n\
  I have to be honest, I had no idea what to expect.  The last month spent in Thailand\
  \ had blown my country-girl mind already and I knew that South East Asia would continue\
  \ to make an impression on me.\n\nOur hotel was a small piece of paradise in an\
  \ otherwise traumatised and broken city.  The staff were eager to get to know us,\
  \ and couldn\u2019t wait to tell us their own stories.  Our waiter was in his early\
  \ thirties and as he took our order, he talked of his family, those whom he had\
  \ lost to genocide and how he played amongst the mines as a youngster.  It was all\
  \ said so matter-of-factly, I was quite taken aback.  I could see that he was not\
  \ seeking pity, he spoke with such an honest, heart-warming smile.  I knew then\
  \ that I was going to like it here.\n\nAfter a good night\u2019s sleep in an obscenely\
  \ air-conditioned room, we quizzed the reception staff on what they recommended\
  \ we do during our brief stay. There was so much to see in this metropolis, we didn\u2019\
  t know where to start.\n\nShortly after, we were introduced to Nana, a young, enthusiastic\
  \ Tuk Tuk driver, who was excited to show us his city.  We told him that we would\
  \ like to learn more about his country\u2019s history and he said that he knew just\
  \ the place to take us to.\n\nIt was 43 degrees centigrade and my Scottish skin\
  \ and heat tolerance levels were being pushed to new heights!  But soon, after a\
  \ hot and bumpy journey, we arrived at a very non-descript entranceway.  Nana jumped\
  \ out of his seat and proceeded to assist me as I clumsily disembarked the Tuk Tuk.\
  \  He announced that we were stood outside the Siem Reap War Museum.  We left Nana\
  \ waiting in the car park at his request and made our way inside.\n\nAt the time\
  \ of paying our entry fee, we were asked if we would like a guide to show us around\
  \ and of course we agreed.  I am so glad that we did.  It was then that we met \u201C\
  Tom\u201D.\n\nThe museum was home to many relics of war.  Helicopters, tanks and\
  \ jet fighters, all towering above me.  As I walked, listening to \u201CTom\u201D\
  , I became transported back to the 1970\u2019s and the days of the Khmer Rouge.\
  \  \n\nJust before the end of the tour, we were asked to take a seat in an open,\
  \ wooden shelter.  I felt uneasy looking around, surrounded by weaponry and photos\
  \ of a time when Cambodia had lost a quarter of its people to mass genocide.  To\
  \ say that I was full of emotion was an understatement.  The realism of what was\
  \ in front of me, was hard to ignore.\n\nI had heard of the Killing Fields and knew\
  \ of this country\u2019s harrowing history.  But for some reason, this quiet, non-touristy,\
  \ selfie-free museum and this graphic story I was being told by the man standing\
  \ in front of me, brought the past back to life.\n\n\u201CTom\u201D whose real name\
  \ is Mean Sokhom, joined the Khmer Rouge at the age of 11.  He was a child soldier\
  \ and had played a part in his own country\u2019s demise.  He told us of his brain\
  \ washing at the hands of this horrific regime, the artillery he used and how the\
  \ war stole his childhood, and his arm. \n\nHe spoke so frankly and honestly, not\
  \ afraid of judgement from his audience. He just wanted to share his story with\
  \ those who wanted to hear it.  I was mesmerised by him.  He had such kindness in\
  \ his eyes, despite the horror that he must have seen or been a party to.\n\nAt\
  \ that moment, something in me changed.  I knew I would never meet anyone like \u201C\
  Tom\u201D again and I knew that I would never be the same person again.  I left\
  \ that museum, not with a heavy heart, but with a new friend, and a friend I still\
  \ have to this day."
