Text: "Hello there\nMy name is Waynesa I\u2019m 25 years old and I am studying Audio\
  \ Production st Full Dail University.\nI am taking this time to explore new cultures\
  \ and talents outside of the United States to help join me on my journey to a great\
  \ career.\nI\u2019ve really never traveled outside of home and honestly I don\u2019\
  t know why because I love people and different cultures. It would be of great honor\
  \ to put this down as an experience I was able to enjoy and learn from and hopefully\
  \ can be apart of. Growing up was very rough I\u2019m from Columbus Ohio with 9\
  \ other siblings. I am the second to the baby and man when I say I understand different\
  \ personalities and sharing things I can really relate. My mother was a single parent\
  \ so I really didn\u2019t try to want or ask for anything because I saw her pain.\
  \ She passed away in 2011 from cervibal cancer but I still managed to graduate high\
  \ school that year. My mother would really want this for me and I know she is proud\
  \ that I am pushing forward when things are hard. Which is why I appreciate her\
  \ so much she made me understand things and see things different to help and show\
  \ others a way. This would be very new for me but also a great and exciting experience\
  \ and a sight to see. I would be honored to share this experience and hopefully\
  \ many more if given a change.\nI really hope you find and resonate with this letter\
  \ to be a favorite of yours because my story isn\u2019t finish yet. This is just\
  \ the beginning!\nThank you for you time\nBest, Waynesa Shade"
