Text: "What do you think is a solid defensive strategy against serial killers prowling\
  \ the U.S. National Parks? A two year old pepper spray that has never been tested?\
  \ Car keys?  It will definitely help if I sleep in the middle of my tent with blankets\
  \ on one side and my backpack on the other - necessary buffers. Am I overreacting?\
  \ \n\nThese are the thoughts racing through my head as I lay in a campsite outside\
  \ of Yosemite. I\u2019m now thinking that listening to a psychological thriller\
  \ audiobook wasn\u2019t the best idea before camping solo. The unfortunate bit is\
  \ that I\u2019m only halfway through the book and I need to finish the story or\
  \ else I\u2019ll continue to make up my own stories. \n\nThe good news is when I\
  \ wake up at sunrise (don\u2019t be impressed, it\u2019s autumn and I went to bed\
  \ when the sun went down around 6pm), my stunning surroundings are a perfect distraction\
  \ and new focus. Nature is the perfect place to relax, decompress, and get into\
  \ the right mindset.\n\nI\u2019ve just left my job, packed up the belongings I didn\u2019\
  t sell to the good strangers of Craigslist, and embarked on a cross-country road\
  \ trip before heading off to Australia on a working holiday visa. \n\nI\u2019ve\
  \ never traveled solo before. The last trip I took was actually with 15 college\
  \ girlfriends. So you might say I\u2019m used to traveling with a crew. But, this\
  \ is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. I told myself that it was time to\
  \ stop waiting - stop waiting for a travel buddy, stop waiting for a job to take\
  \ me to all the places I dream about - just go.\n\nI don\u2019t know where this\
  \ journey will bring me or who I\u2019ll meet along the way. I want to focus on\
  \ myself and rediscover what truly makes me happy. To stop defaulting to what I\u2019\
  m good at or roles I\u2019ve fallen into in the past. To become intentional with\
  \ my choices.\n\nThe things I know starting off are that I love to read and write.\
  \ I\u2019ve always linked travel and reading. Some people associate memories with\
  \ a certain song or certain smell. I connect with the book I was reading at the\
  \ time. I have a clear memory of sobbing on the bus on my way to work in Washington\
  \ D.C. as I learned that a favorite character was diagnosed with a terminal disease.\
  \ Or feeling sketched out in an Italian train station when I finished my book and\
  \ thought a man was following me, leading me to move from platform to platform to\
  \ be with other people until my own train arrived (another thriller, you might notice\
  \ an unfortunate trend here).  There was the time that I laughed out loud and woke\
  \ up my neighbor on a plane home from Dubai.\n\nFrom the beginning of this story,\
  \ you might think this was going to be a tale full of intrigue and murder. Fortunately\
  \ for me (and my worry-prone mother!), that\u2019s not the case. It\u2019s just\
  \ a story of a girl with an active imagination trying to reach her reading goal\
  \ before the end of the year while beginning to fulfill a lifelong goal of full\
  \ time travel."
