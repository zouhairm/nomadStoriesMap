Text: "I sat in a large room with about 20 other women, looking out the very small\
  \ window that showed the hustling Karachi traffic. I looked around at the paint\
  \ chipping from the blue and grey walls and remember thinking if this was the most\
  \ sanitary place to get my pedicure done. There was minimal ventilation and the\
  \ pungent smell of nail polish, acetone, and sweat was filling my nostrils. But\
  \ my cousin had told me this was one of the most famous beauty parlors in Karachi.\
  \ I guess I had to believe her. \n\nI almost felt guilty sitting there with the\
  \ nine other women getting our nails done. The class difference between the women\
  \ in the chairs and the women bending down in front of them was quite obvious. The\
  \ other women were locals, I could tell. But they probably lived in Defense and\
  \ Clifton, the richer part of the city. \n\nI wanted to speak to the technician\
  \ who was massaging my feet, but my Urdu was mediocre at best, especially compared\
  \ to the speed in which the together girls were speaking. So I sat there quietly\
  \ and would smile at her whenever she looked up at me. \n\nShe finally asked me\
  \ in her broken English, \u201CWhat your name?\u201D\n\nI immediately responded,\
  \ not wanting to come off rude. I felt bad that she had taken the initiative to\
  \ speak to me first, even though her English was worse than my Urdu.\n\n\u201CFaiza,\u201D\
  \ she said, pointing to herself. \n\nNot only had she initiated the conversation,\
  \ she gave me her name without me having to ask. I felt worse and decided I needed\
  \ to start speaking. I didn\u2019t want to  come off arrogant, even though it was\
  \ my own insecurity in my native language that was holding me back. \n\n\u201CYou\
  \ come from Qatar?\u201D she asked, pointing to my phone case that had the Qatari\
  \ flag on it. \n\nIt was a gift from my sister, who lived in Qatar with her family.\
  \ \n\n\u201CNo. I\u2019m from America. Detroit!\u201D\n\nThe smile on her face grew\
  \ with the recognition of the city. \n\nShe start mixing her Urdu and broken English\
  \ as best she could for my sake. She told me how it\u2019s her dream to go to America\
  \ one day. She talked about the movies she watched and asked if New York was just\
  \ like in the movies. Her innocence and excitement moved me and I shared all I could\
  \ with her about America. \n\n\u201CHow to make my English better?\u201D she asked\
  \ me. \nShe wanted to speak English fluently so that she could communicate if she\
  \ ever visited one day. I smile thoughtfully at her eagerness to learn. Meanwhile,\
  \ I was sure I could get by with English in my own country. \nMy privilege had become\
  \ apparent to me. I expected people to accommodate my language, even in a country\
  \ like Pakistan, where English isn\u2019t even the national language. Meanwhile,\
  \ Faiza was already putting effort into travels even she wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019\
  d make. \n\nI started speaking in my broken Urdu and told her to watch more movies\
  \ in English and read books to expand her vocabulary. I told her to practice with\
  \ her friends, even if she felt like she\u2019s not saying it right. I gave her\
  \ all the advice I should\u2019ve taken myself and my the end of her conversation,\
  \ I was speaking almost entirely in Urdu and she was responding in English. \n\n\
  Faiza taught me more in that conversation than she knows. She helped me realize\
  \ my privilege and insecurity in one shot and she helped to try and overcome it.\
  \ I guess that beauty parlor really was the best in all of Karachi."
