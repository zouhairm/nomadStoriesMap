Text: "The city I live in Pune was not the city I was born in. I come from a big city,\
  \ the financial capital of India, Mumbai. I came to Pune because I wanted to be\
  \ independent and find a job, which I did, but paid me just enough to get by. Pune\
  \ is known for its tradition and culture and even in the progressing world of information\
  \ technology, this city is thriving to put its best foot forward and retaining its\
  \ hold as the cultural capital of Maharashtra. \nThis city is proud of the many\
  \ music concerts, film festivals and food festivals it holds. This city has a vibrancy\
  \ of youth as students from across the world and India come here to study... it\
  \ offers the best of education too. \nDespite living here and working here, I am\
  \ yet to uncover all about this city. In every nook and corner of this city, there\
  \ is a story to be uncovered, a myth revealed or an old relic discovered. Every\
  \ day, I am making slow progress about the city as I travel on my trusted two wheeler,\
  \ looking for things unknown, they are in your face and yet unknown like the blue\
  \ plaques which tell you so much about the homes of the well known authors, poets,\
  \ singers, artists who have contributed to put this city on the global map. or perhaps\
  \ the different old style eateries which have withstood the rage of fast food and\
  \ still have a hold over the preferences of traditional Indian snacks. \nThere is\
  \ so much to discover and relate that makes this city part of my treasure hunt.\
  \ \nEveryday I seek a new thread to follow and uncover the many vivid connections\
  \ that make my day."
