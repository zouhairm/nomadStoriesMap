Text: "I was living then in my apartment in Downtown Toronto in the city that never\
  \ sleeps. It was one of those sleepless nights. My eyes gazing at the white ceiling\
  \ above me as I could hear the sounds of busyness in the streets. I started wondering\
  \ to myself, why is it that I am always unhappy and depressed? I had this void in\
  \ me that I couldn\u2019t justify. I recall talking to myself trying to make a logical\
  \ explanation of the way I am feeling but I couldn\u2019t. I started thinking about\
  \ how blessed I am with everything that God has given me from a loving family, health,\
  \ to even be living in a safe environment. So, what is it that I am lacking? What\
  \ is this void in me that is eating me alive? I have been feeling trapped for a\
  \ long time now. I needed an escape away from everyone, away from the busy life,\
  \ to allow myself to Be. \n\nIt was in July, when I decided I am going to drop everything\
  \ I have going on in my life and travel to Paros, Greece. I was no longer accepting\
  \ the way I was living my life. I just hoped that by moving away I can get my sanity\
  \ back. \n\nOnce there I have spent most of my time sitting on the beach. I was\
  \ enjoying the sounds of waves crawling gently to and away from the shore. I could\
  \ see the chirping seagulls fly over the clear, blue sea. It was the first time\
  \ that I wake up to the sounds of nature not some alarm. \n\nI wanted to live fully\
  \ in my trip and engage in the culture. I went out everyday to a new tavern for\
  \ lunch. I slowly came to realize the importance of food is to the Greeks. It symbolizes\
  \ being part of a community that unconditionally love one another. They take it\
  \ seriously and live it fully. When it is time for a meal everyone gathers together.\
  \ They drop behind them their busy work life and focus on connecting with each other.\
  \ \n\nOne tavern blew my mind away. As I arrived at the tavern, I was bombarded\
  \ with a large white gate. I held the handle and opened the door. As I got in, I\
  \ found myself in the middle of a large field of land filled with fresh fruits and\
  \ vegetables. There was a pathway on the ground that guided me to the tavern. As\
  \ I was walking through the path, I could smell the scent of the herbs around me.\
  \ I saw red ripe tomatoes, watermelons of all sizes, and even cucumbers. \n\nOnce\
  \ I arrived there I was seated on a table. I was greeted with a heart-warming smile\
  \ and a huge hug, that took me off guard. \n\nAs I was looking at the menu, a man\
  \ approached and asked me: \"\u0395\u03AF\u03C3\u03B1\u03C3\u03C4\u03B5 \u03B5\u03B4\
  \u03CE \u03BC\u03CC\u03BD\u03B7 \u03C3\u03AC\u03C2?\"\n\nI responded back to him\
  \ saying: \"Sorry but I didn\u2019t understand what you said. I do not speak Greek.\"\
  \n\nHe asked me again rephrasing this time: \"Are you here alone?\"\n\nI answered\
  \ him back: \"Yes.\"\n\nHe immediately invited me to join his family for lunch telling\
  \ me: \u201CHere in Greece no one eats alone.\u201D\n\nI have never experienced\
  \ this kind of love from a stranger before. \n\nI joined them on their table for\
  \ lunch. The food tasted incredible. I savored every bit of it, as I slowly chewed\
  \ every bite, tasting the food fully. I was observing everyone around me, the tears\
  \ of joy and love were creeping down my face. This sense of void suddenly disappeared.\
  \ I was able to see clearly. It felt like the world made sense to me. I noticed\
  \ a shift in my energy. I was at peace with myself and in full surrender to the\
  \ moment. I noticed a sense of connection and being."
