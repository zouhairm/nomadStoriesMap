Text: "I held the squirming bundle of fabric close to my chest as I boarded the bus\
  \ I'd hastily scheduled the night before, to bring me straight to the heart of Ecuador.\
  \ A pacifying smile softened the weather hardened driver and I slid quietly into\
  \ my seat, attempting to deflect the attention my blonde hair had already drawn\
  \ to me. I'd spent the past three weeks this way, chatting swiftly through hostel\
  \ reception desks and wildly hailing tuk tuk drivers all while keeping my small\
  \ secret concealed.  I pulled the woven blanket back softly as we gained speed down\
  \ the Andean highway, her small pointed face poked out, eyes brimming with curiosity.\
  \ One tiny paw, as white as the clouds hovering amid the dark emeralds of the lush\
  \ landscape, reached out softly for my hand. Within moments she had assumed her\
  \ travelling position as she often did on these long haul journeys. Nestled in the\
  \ crook of my elbow, no longer than half of my forearm, she lay quietly. Simply\
  \ observing the world blurring past her in a kaleidoscope of jewel tones nestled\
  \ in valleys and cast across endless skies. \n\nGuayaquil was a rush of colours,\
  \ sounds, and tastes, as my stowaway and I became part of the throbbing crowd in\
  \ a bus station that more closely resembled an airport. The immediate urgency in\
  \ the air was contagious as we bumped and fumbled our way out into the city streets\
  \ and threw ourselves into the closest taxi for an ironic breath of fresh air and\
  \ space. I got my first real look at the metropolis spreading out before me as we\
  \ made our way to the only veterinarian google knew existed. The palm trees caressed\
  \ the skyline as the city streetlights began to hum and glow, gently illuminating\
  \ the dusk that had settled quietly over the mountains. \n\nAfter a quick examination\
  \ and a very brief chat in my broken Spanish, both Taco (a name halfheartedly given\
  \ as a joke, which ended up sticking) and I were determined tired, but healthy,\
  \ and we were sent home to rest. A $180 goodie bag of vitamins, specialized cat\
  \ shampoo, and a deworming agent weighing heavily in both my wallet and 75L backpack.\
  \ After my first and last attempt at bathing a cat, we curled up in the starchy\
  \ sheets of our hostel dorm, and awaited the adventures morning was sure to bring,\
  \ her small body pressed against my neck as we faded into sleep.\n\nAs fate would\
  \ have it, that would be our last night shared together. \n\nI had the good fortune\
  \ of meeting Alejandro as I let Taco wander the lush green city park after our obligatory\
  \ coffee run. She pawed right over to him, all life and curiosity, gave him a cautious\
  \ sniff, and proceeded to curl up in his lap as he sat there in the grass, undisturbed,\
  \ thumbing the pages of a well worn book. I approached anxiously and slowly, introducing\
  \ myself and our situation in limited Spanish and google translate. We swapped stories\
  \ like old friends reconnecting for the first time in decades, albeit, with more\
  \ difficulty. Alejandro had the exquisite title of being a crazy cat man, having\
  \ rescued multiple black cats from overly superstitious neighbourhoods, and here\
  \ I was, a woman who smuggled a kitten across all of Ecuador as I traversed north\
  \ towards Colombia. In an act of pure instinct, I handed over her medical records\
  \ and supplies the vet had given me the night before, and we promised to stay in\
  \ touch, which we do to this day.\n\nIn all my years on the road since, through\
  \ whirlwind romances, meeting friends I regard as family, and many more stray cats,\
  \ I've never faced a more difficult goodbye. \n\nI left home on my first backpacking\
  \ trip with the intention of finding myself, little did I know it'd be in the curiously\
  \ bright eyes of a kitten staring back at me, as we took on the world together."
