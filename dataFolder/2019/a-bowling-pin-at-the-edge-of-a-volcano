Text: "The first pang of uneasiness came early. Swept onto a shaky chairlift, ascending\
  \ the first 1,000 meters of the Villaricca volcano, I sucked in my breath: There\
  \ was no protective bar. Don't look down, I told myself, nervously clutching at\
  \ my equipment. High above miles of hardened lava, I reassured myself: At least\
  \ the most dangerous part of this trek would soon be behind me.\n\nI had come to\
  \ Pucon from Israel, and though I had hoped for a break from my compatriots, I soon\
  \ found myself surrounded by hundreds of recently discharged IDF soldiers. On the\
  \ so-called Hummus Trail (the tongue-in-cheek name for the well-traveled circuit\
  \ in South America from which few Israelis stray), I found a staggering amount of\
  \ conformity -- the Israeli vets dressed alike, went to the same hostels, went on\
  \ the same hikes. Online, Israelis poked fun at this trend, even as they made no\
  \ attempt to change it: If an Israeli goes to South America without a black Columbia\
  \ softshell jacket, did he/she really go? asked one Facebook post with quasi-philosophical\
  \ earnestness.\n\nThe things they carried were also similar: The stickers and pins\
  \ with photos of their babyfaced friends who had been killed in action (Many were\
  \ names that I recognized; I wrote or edited the news stories of their deaths. Morbidly,\
  \ I wondered if someday, when a war inevitably drags them into the reserves, I'd\
  \ recognize my fellow travelers' names). There were the stress lines framing the\
  \ eyes of the otherwise painfully vibrant 21-year-old commandos, the bravado-laced\
  \ stories of terror attacks thwarted, and the seemingly contradictory sense of both\
  \ impenetrability and precariousness that accompanies brushes with death.\n\nLooking\
  \ on mostly from afar -- I am not a veteran and am older than the ex-soldiers --\
  \ their choice to remain in an Israeli bubble was bewildering. They were here to\
  \ shrug off the rigors of military life, but most traveled in packs with their army\
  \ buddies, following the orders dictated by Israeli travel guides.\n\nWhich is why\
  \ it didn't take me much by surprise when the guide on the Villaricca looked at\
  \ me quizzically when I told him where I lived and asked, \"But why didn't you go\
  \ with the Israeli agency?\"\n\nAnd despite my very best attempts, Hebrew filled\
  \ the air as we arrived at the base of the volcano. \n\nAfter hours of hiking over\
  \ loose black sand, we arrived at a glacier, strapped crampons on our shoes and\
  \ grabbed an ice ax, dubbed by our guide as \"your best friend.\" If you stumble,\
  \ you must throw the ax into the mountain and lift your right leg, he instructed,\
  \ demonstrating the maneuver just once. Otherwise, you will fall down to Pucon,\
  \ he said breezily. There are crevices in the glacier, and if you fall in one...\
  \ he paused to whistle ominously, the meaning unmistakable. Then there was the \"\
  dangerous\" part, he continued, nonchalantly flashing air quotes. Everyone must\
  \ look up and warn others if rocks start falling in our direction, he said, adding\
  \ that he'll try to instruct us where to move in such a scenario.\n\nWe began the\
  \ steep ascent. Don't stumble, I told myself, each step of my left foot laden with\
  \ terror, my right foot light with exhilaration. The clouds were below, meeting\
  \ the edge of the glacier. Is this heaven? I wondered. I took care not to find out\
  \ with a tragic misstep. \n\nSuddenly -- a scream.\n\nI looked up. \n\nBouncing\
  \ boulders were headed in our direction, zigzagging silently on the snow. The guide's\
  \ eyes were fixed on the stones and we kept our eyes on him. He didn't say a word.\n\
  \nI should move, I realized belatedly. Then, in the split-second space of my memory\
  \ that is now blank, I was pushed into a snowdrift by an Australian woman on my\
  \ left. I'm so sorry, she said, clearly oblivious to the immediacy of the danger.\
  \ A rock tore through the spot where we had stood a moment earlier, and adrenaline\
  \ violently ripped through my veins, lasting for hours.\n\nAnd when we reached the\
  \ bottom of the volcano, I looked up again.\n\nThere stood the identically dressed,\
  \ laughing, ex-Israeli soldiers, precariously perched on the volcano's edge like\
  \ a row of stiff-necked bowling pins."
