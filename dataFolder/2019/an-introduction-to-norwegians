Text: "\u201CExcuse me, is this flight going to Volda?\u201D \n\nThe woman on the\
  \ gate looks up blankly. \u201CNo.\u201D Her tone suggests this should be obvious.\
  \ She goes back to her computer screen. Sitting down again I look at my boarding\
  \ pass, which doesn\u2019t say a gate. But the other employee at Oslo airport I\
  \ could find had said that this was the gate to Volda. I nervously eye the scattering\
  \ of other waiting people around me. I can\u2019t work up the courage to approach\
  \ any of them. I picture myself briefly; wide eyed, confused, teary. I must look\
  \ a state, my head dashing this way and that, looking at everything and finding\
  \ nothing. This is the quietest part of the airport, I think since I had to walk\
  \ the length of the rest to get to it. I ignored the shops, the food, though I haven\u2019\
  t eaten all day. (I\u2019ve been very stressed). I wanted to find my gate, knowing\
  \ I had plenty of time, and then go and have a wander and find some food. That won\u2019\
  t happen now, I\u2019m too nervous to take my eyes of where my flight should arrive,\
  \ in a couple of hours. Messages come through on my phone telling me that I have\
  \ no messaging services, no data-roaming whatever that means. It\u2019s not good.\
  \ I\u2019m desperate to get hold of the people at the other end who are going to\
  \ help me, and pick me up from the airport. In Volda/Orsta. The last message he\
  \ sent me (I don\u2019t know who he is yet, we\u2019ve never met) said that he\u2019\
  d heard my flight may be cancelled. I of course started panicking, tried to get\
  \ hold of him, then discovered I couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s the middle of the night,\
  \ it is dark outside. And my flight is not up on the board, so I have no proof it\u2019\
  ll even arrive. \n\t\nThis is the first time I have ever travelled alone. The flight\
  \ from Heathrow, London, to Oslo was the first flight I had ever been on. My parents\
  \ dropped me off and we watched the planes take off as we waited (we were very early).\
  \ That part was good, it would have been exciting but it had suddenly hit me what\
  \ I was about to do. Alone. I hugged them goodbye at security, looking back over\
  \ my shoulder I watched them getting smaller. As soon as I was through, I texted\
  \ them. They said I had looked so small, walking off on my own. \n\t\nI discovered\
  \ that I like flying. When the first flight took off it was exciting. Landing was\
  \ fun too. Everyone told me it wouldn\u2019t be worth sitting by the window, that\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything. But I proved them wrong. It was incredible.\
  \ I made pictures out of the lights that passed in the darkness below us. I felt\
  \ like a child making shapes out of the clouds. Once I landed though I felt like\
  \ a child in a significantly worse way. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been so\
  \ scared, as I was in Oslo airport. \n\t\nI got to Volda in the end. I arrived at\
  \ 5am. The flight had been diverted, to some place I couldn\u2019t concentrate on.\
  \ It was around a four hour drive, I was still nervous but once on the bus I didn\u2019\
  t mind. I like journeys, and enjoyed the opportunity to get a perspective of Norway.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t see much of Volda itself in the dark, except fragments pointed\
  \ out by the taxi driver. This made the biggest shock the next morning, when, upon\
  \ opening my curtains, the enormity of the surrounding mountains took my breath\
  \ away. Rotsethornet filled my window. Now I felt the excitement. I was in Norway\
  \ and here I\u2019d be studying for five months. I hope my next encounter with a\
  \ Norwegian will be more elaborate than the one I had at Oslo airport."
