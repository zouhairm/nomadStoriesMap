Text: "The cold, damp countryside slipped past my window. In the early-morning light,\
  \ the world didn\u2019t just seem to be waking for a new day, it seemed to be waking\
  \ for the first day. This was a prehistoric dawn, the beginning of a world untold\
  \ centuries younger than the one I had left eight hours before. I knew I hadn\u2019\
  t really travelled back in time. In fact, I\u2019d travelled forward several hours.\
  \ But as the pale light grew, enlivening the ocean air and lifting the primordial\
  \ darkness all around, I felt that I was at the dawn of a new age, if not in the\
  \ life of the world, at least in my own. The stars vanishing from the sky appeared\
  \ in my eyes as I gazed out across the landscape. I was in an ancient, yet new land:\
  \ Iceland.\n\nI had travelled before, but not like this. The family holidays of\
  \ my youth had been exciting for the time, but they were always planned and known.\
  \ I was a passenger rather than a traveler. But now mom and dad weren\u2019t here.\
  \ It was just me, my brother, and our friend, and we weren\u2019t only going to\
  \ nice, familiar places. We had replaced all that planning, security, and comfort\
  \ with a general outline and a simple plan: for the next three months, make the\
  \ road our home. But which roads, in which countries, time alone would tell. I was\
  \ at the beginning of the adventure I\u2019d always dreamed of.\n\nYet often when\
  \ dreams turn into realities, and your hazy visions crystalize in actual experiences,\
  \ things aren\u2019t quite as charming as you\u2019d expected. Here too, my iridescent\
  \ revelries were soon replaced by stark realities. It was chaos at our hostel, the\
  \ first I\u2019d ever stayed in. We sat in the overrun bar for over an hour waiting\
  \ for our room and repressing our hunger to avoid buying the food, priced well outside\
  \ of our paper-thin budgets. Finally in our room, I was taken aback by the cold\
  \ steel bunk-beds and lockers separated only by a narrow alley. It wasn\u2019t exactly\
  \ a Hilton, or even a Super 8. I grabbed my towel and stepped into the communal\
  \ men\u2019s bathroom to decompress with a shower, but was met by a locker-room\
  \ style community shower and several unabashed bathers facing all directions. Iceland\
  \ was once home to the Vikings, but this whole hostel felt more Spartan. \n\nWe\
  \ left to start exploring Reykjav\xEDk, but first we had to eat something. Looking\
  \ to save money, we walked into a mini-mart. But here too the prices seemed outrageous.\
  \ We decided an artificial-looking sweet loaf would give us the best bang for our\
  \ buck. Near the store, we found some stumps and used them as a table and chairs.\
  \ We tore into our bread ravenously, but stopped mid-bite. It was terrible. The\
  \ windy drizzle ripped through our scant layers as we forced the dry crumbs down\
  \ our throats. We looked at each other piteously, the same thought on all our minds:\
  \ This is our life now.\n\nAs it turns out, things got a lot better, and I enjoyed\
  \ many of the moments I\u2019d dreamed about, whether standing on top of the world\
  \ in the Alps, laying in the heat of a Mediterranean sun, or basking in the awe\
  \ of Notre Dame. But looking back, I treasure that rough start because it began\
  \ teaching me a vital lesson about travel: Travelling isn\u2019t always fun, exciting,\
  \ and beautiful. Sometimes it\u2019s hard and unpleasant. But with that struggle\
  \ comes a richer experience. You see, travelling isn\u2019t vacationing. It\u2019\
  s not just about relaxing; it\u2019s about growing. It\u2019s about leaving the\
  \ known and venturing into the unknown, seeing something new, doing something new,\
  \ and, ultimately, becoming someone new. The mixture of beauty and struggle you\
  \ encounter, and the tapestry of experience it weaves within you, won\u2019t allow\
  \ you to come back the same person you left as. But why would you want to come back\
  \ the same? If you do, you might as well never have left. \n\nSo I\u2019ll venture\
  \ onward, I\u2019ll take the good with the bad, and I\u2019ll grow, because I\u2019\
  m not going just for the laughs. I\u2019m going for the life."
