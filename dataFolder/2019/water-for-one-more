Text: "Slim layers of knitted blankets separate me from the chilled concrete; this\
  \ makeshift mattress is hospitality in Balik Pulau. Premature crows from a band\
  \ of roosters in the coast-hugging fields wake us. An innate urgency carries like\
  \ a swift turbulence through our one bedroom abode. Bodies washed, laces tied, hijabs\
  \ fashioned and it is time to fetch the day\u2019s water. \n\nSounds of the Salat\
  \ al Fajr hum in the distance; the first prayer before the sun\u2019s debut, a chant\
  \ I don\u2019t understand, but know by heart. \n\nThree small children pile into\
  \ a sidecar, each carrying a tin jug doubling in size. They maneuver like pieces\
  \ in a game of Tetris, leaving no vacant space. Seat belts and safety are a thing\
  \ of the past. \n\nMy host father, Sabil, beckons me to sit on the back of the motorbike.\
  \ I have been in rural Penang long enough to notice women only sit to one side,\
  \ their legs uninviting, their balance a birthright. I mount the bike like a sidesaddle.\
  \ How hard could it be?\n\nAnother tin jug is handed to me. \u201CFour?\u201D I\
  \ hold up each finger hoping one is there by mistake. My host mother, Bisma, pries\
  \ my grip free from the seat, my fingertips denting its leather with a trail of\
  \ little crescent moons. \u201CLook mom, no hands!\u201D She flashes the same teeth-baring\
  \ smile that greeted me at a nearby mosque just days ago. \n\nCoating our hijabs\
  \ with dust on our journey through town, farmers tend to their rice paddies, shuffling\
  \ through clay-like soil in the dark. Husks still intact, the scent of durian flesh\
  \ layers over us, stronger with each kilometer. The \u201Cking of fruits\u201D,\
  \ its wickedly persistent odor penetrates far beyond that of island flowers or wild\
  \ animal spoor.  \n\nLit by a single street lamp, we are the first to arrive at\
  \ the fountain. There are no coins to be tossed or wishes to be made, just a task\
  \ to fulfill. A collective effort, we fill each jug one by one, like a factory line,\
  \ our motions in tandem. My youngest host sister falls into a panic; she has spilt\
  \ an entire jug. A fading moon reflects off the newly wet street. But we are too\
  \ resilient to cry over spilled water and maintain a steady pace.\n\nAcross the\
  \ street a charter bus full of tourists arrives. They watch us intently, this unfathomable\
  \ ritual an opening act in their day of living off the land. They will learn how\
  \ to make Nasi Lemak, a dinner paired with laughter on our floor just hours earlier.\
  \ They will witness how Penangites only double-digit kilometers away from shopping\
  \ malls and four-lane highways harvest rice. They will journey by sea to Pulau Jerejak,\
  \ cross swaying bridges over the lush jungle greens and tour abandoned concrete\
  \ structures masked in graffiti, a glimpse of the island\u2019s post-asylum remains.\
  \ Oh, if those walls could talk. \n\nAll while wondering how this life is lived\
  \ unplugged and unplumbed. Arriving to town on the same bus just one week before,\
  \ my thoughts mirrored just that. How? \n\nAs I cleanse in preparation for Salat\
  \ al Isha, the day\u2019s final prayer, I can\u2019t help but reminisce all the\
  \ warm and private moments I have had with water. Countless times I have turned\
  \ on a faucet and it appeared before me like magic, sorcery so steadfast and effortless.\
  \ Washing the car and filling plastic guns just for amusement now seem so impractical.\
  \ \n\nDeep in prayer with my palms pressed together a sobering realization washes\
  \ over me: accessibility to water represents status. I\u2019ve known a life of privilege\
  \ but it is my host family who is undeniably rich. They are the ones who rise before\
  \ dawn and together labor tirelessly for a finite supply of the world\u2019s greatest\
  \ gift, and when given the chance to share that of which gives life, water."
