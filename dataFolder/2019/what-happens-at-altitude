Text: "In the parts of Burma which are tangibly less governed, motorcycle imports\
  \ are strapped to the back of other bikes.  These are driven down the mountain by\
  \ teenagers, who regard me with confusion as I head past in the other direction.\
  \ \n\nThere is just one road across the northern Shan hills, and the end of it is\
  \ China.  The only English word I can see is METALLICA, another rider\u2019s jacket.\
  \  The people smile like they know something I don\u2019t, and sell rattan furniture\
  \ from makeshift laybys.  With rapidly increasing altitude, the tropics give way\
  \ to something grassy and temperate, and everything is red clay, ox-carts, wood\
  \ smoke.  K pulls over outside a hut which is half bamboo, half corrugated iron,\
  \ and we buy petrol from a man who looks questioningly at our attire.  My shoulders\
  \ have already burnt but it\u2019s too hot for a jacket.  Y removes hers to reveal\
  \ a shirt declaring:\n\nNO GODS\nNO MONSTERS\nNO BOYFRIENDS\n\nWe journey further,\
  \ downshifting on the bends and squirrelling past overladen trucks.  The bike I\
  \ have chosen is sturdy but sluggish, and I keep falling behind.  I see a rider\
  \ collide with one of the trucks.  His wife is thrown from the back of his bike,\
  \ and a crowd rushes to help her.  She looks unimpressed and shoos them away.\n\n\
  I reconvene with Y and K at the summit, just outside Pyin Oo Lwin.  We find a hotel\
  \ named after a beer.  The rotund man at the desk sees only one of us is Burmese\
  \ and double charges for the room - a cavernous homage to the Anci\xE9n Regime in\
  \ white lacquer \u2013 but we find the minibar well stocked, and order fried rice\
  \ with barbecued goat.  Our faces are covered in road.  \n\nPyin Oo Lwin was built\
  \ by the British, for the British, on top of a mountain high enough to keep the\
  \ British adequately refrigerated.  There are botanical gardens, mock Tudor villas,\
  \ and horse-drawn carriages.  We arrive at the wedding in our road clothes, all\
  \ leather jackets and baseball caps, and feel suddenly askew upon sight of everyone\u2019\
  s linen suits and silk skirts.  \u201CI thought this was supposed to be a gay wedding,\u201D\
  \ says Y.\n\nPhotography is banned.  This ceremony is illegal in Burma, yet it is\
  \ staged in public, in the gardens, with one of the brides dressed up as a princess\
  \ and the other dressed up as a groom.  Pyin Oo Lwin lies at the border between\
  \ Burma proper and the Shan States, an area in which government is not welcomed.\
  \  The territory is mostly contested by opium-farming paramilitaries, who do not\
  \ appear to care about lesbians getting married.  The reception is held at a restaurant.\
  \  I see my friend W striding across the foyer in a newly tailored suit, exasperated\
  \ but grinning.  A very large man feeds champagne to a very small dog.  Someone\
  \ has lost her shoes; her friends are covered in glitter.  By the end of the night\
  \ we all have very few boundaries, and the bride who is dressed as a groom perambulates\
  \ the dance floor, grinning, tearful.  She tells us she likes our jackets.  It is\
  \ getting cold, we are on top of the world, and we are suddenly grateful for them.\
  \  \n\nThe next day we drive back down to Mandalay, and I visit W at the hotel where\
  \ he works.  He shows me the image he is selling to visitors, the brochures for\
  \ tours, the temples, pagodas, \u201CMyanmar Culture,\u201D something less homogeneous\
  \ than the government would like to let on.  As we discuss the events of the previous\
  \ night, this image seems cartoonish and childlike.  Standing on the roof with a\
  \ beer and a pizza, we look out past the new high-rises to the Shan hills, and wonder\
  \ what will happen next."
