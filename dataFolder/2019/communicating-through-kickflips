Text: "As someone from Southern California I (very stereotypically) grew up skateboarding\
  \ and consider it to be one of my greatest passions. It is not only the act of skateboarding\
  \ that I love but also the culture, art, and history of skateboarding. Skateboarding\
  \ subculture is usually seen as emanating from America, however there are small\
  \ but strong skateboarding communities all over the world. When I was in Tokyo I\
  \ went to the H.L.N.A. skatepark, interested in seeing the ways in which Japanese\
  \ skateboarding culture pulls from American skateboarding culture and even more\
  \ interested in seeing how the two differ.\n\nMy time in Tokyo was plagued with\
  \ rain, which is not ideal for skateboarding. When I made it to the park there was\
  \ only a small group of skaters braving the stormy weather, I tried to introduce\
  \ myself but none of them spoke English and my Japanese is lacking to say the least.\
  \ The other skaters stared me down as I stretched and began to warm up. \n\nWhen\
  \ I got comfortable on my board, I could feel the locals begin to loosen up to my\
  \ presence. After a couple of minutes skating by myself, a local named Hiro joined\
  \ me. We took turns doing tricks on the small box obstacle, talking in our own way.\
  \ I started with a basic grind, he followed up with the same grind and a flip trick\
  \ out -- our conversation continued.  Hiro challenged me to try new tricks and also\
  \ to look at the obstacle in a new way. Skateboarding style is developed around\
  \ nuances in the urban landscape and is focused on a creative use of urban space.\
  \ Due to Tokyo\u2019s unique urban layout skateboarders have developed skateboarding\
  \ styles and techniques which are completely different than those which exist in\
  \ other places. Between tricks we had short conversations on topics that we could\
  \ manage with our limited language overlap. Hiro was able to share his much more\
  \ complicated perspective on the urban environment with me, our dialogue didn't\
  \ consist of words but a dance on pieces of wood with wheels bolted to the bottom."
