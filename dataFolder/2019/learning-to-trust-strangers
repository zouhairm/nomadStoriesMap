Text: "The taxi stand was empty when we arrived in the parking lot. We sat on a wooden\
  \ bench, soaking wet. It rained hard in Playa Blanca that day, but now the sky was\
  \ clear and we could hear the waves behind us.\nThat morning we had arrived from\
  \ Cartagena, where we were staying, after a bumpy taxi ride: we had no phone signal,\
  \ the road signs were misleading, the army stopped us once to search the car, and\
  \ no one we asked seemed to know where the beach was. All the while I thought of\
  \ the advice people in Mexico had given me about Colombia: don't accept help from\
  \ strangers, don't use unauthorized transport, let people know where you are. The\
  \ usual. I was anxious, but my friends, two Austrians and a Greek, did not seem\
  \ very worried.\n\nPerhaps because it\u2019s hard to worry in Playa Blanca. The\
  \ sea is of the clearest blue, even when it rains, and the palm trees almost touch\
  \ the water. We had swum, walked, ate fried fish and coconut rice, and we had swum\
  \ again. And now, shivering in our wet shorts, we almost regretted it. We knew we'd\
  \ fight if we talked, so we didn't. Instead, we approached three backpackers at\
  \ the other end of the parking lot and asked where they were going. To Cartagena.\
  \ Could we join them? There wasn't enough space, but they could send a taxi for\
  \ us once they arrived in the city. We\u2019d be fine.\n\nBut the taxi never came.\
  \ It was dark already when we saw a van approaching. The paint was peeling and the\
  \ windshield cracked. It stopped before us and a man got out. \u201CGoing to Cartagena?\u201D\
  , he asked in English. \u201CDid they send you to pick us up?\u201D, my friend asked.\
  \ He looked at each one of us before saying, \u201CSure\u201D. \u201CWe expected\
  \ a taxi.\u201D \u201CThis is a taxi. I\u2019m Herminio.\u201D He opened the door\
  \ and we looked at each other. My friends shrugged as if saying it was worst to\
  \ stay there. They got in before I could argue, so I did too, my heart beating fast.\n\
  \nHerminio didn\u2019t talk much. I could see his eyes in the rearview mirror, from\
  \ which hung a rosary made of yellow, blue and red beads. \u201CI don\u2019t think\
  \ this is the way we came from, we\u2019re going to Cartagena\u201D, I said in Spanish.\
  \ \u201CFaster this way\u201D, he replied, and then, \u201CHa! Bogot\xE1? Thought\
  \ you all were foreign\u201D. \u201CI\u2019m from Mexico\u201D, I said. \u201CMexico!\
  \ We\u2019re hermanos, then.\u201D He laughed, pulled over on the side of the road\
  \ and got off. \u201CWait here\u201D. \n\nShould we get off, hitchhike, walk to\
  \ a gas station? We were not yet on the highway and by the time everybody started\
  \ to get nervous I was already panicking. But before we decided on anything, Herminio\
  \ came back. He got in, turned back and gave me something wrapped in paper. I could\
  \ feel my heart beating hard against my ribs. And then he said, \u201CPan de coco,\
  \ traditional. And another gift\u201D. He started playing mariachi music. \u201C\
  We are so similar, Mexico and Colombia. I know you\u2019re scared, we\u2019re used\
  \ to being scared here too. But if we don\u2019t trust our hermanos, where\u2019\
  s peace to be found?\u201D. I could see in the mirror that he was smiling.\n\nOnly\
  \ then I realized how tense I was. I thought only Herminio could know, for it was\
  \ us who had grown up reading scary stories of violence and crime, learning not\
  \ to trust strangers. Colombia was indeed similar to Mexico, with its safety curfews\
  \ and cities divided into safe and dangerous areas. \n\nHerminio talked long about\
  \ his town and asked of mine, we laughed at how we pronounced certain words and\
  \ argued over who had the best coffee. Of course, we got back safe and sound, and\
  \ everywhere in Cartagena, we encountered people that, like Herminio, thought that\
  \ to trust each other was an act of resistance. All we found were open doors and\
  \ kind words in what had been once one of the most dangerous cities in Latin America."
