Text: "In May, the white marble of the Taj Mahal becomes so hot in the unforgiving\
  \ Agra summer that it is recommended to wear socks so you don\u2019t burn your bare\
  \ feet on the floor. It was in this sweltering heat that I trekked back to the Agra\
  \ train station through the 500m vehicle-ban zone that the government established\
  \ in 2010 to protect the Taj from pollution which was beginning to turn the monument\
  \ yellow. With no ticket reservation back to Delhi, I bought a platform ticket for\
  \ 40 rupees and hoped for the best.\n\nBodies on the platform conglomerated into\
  \ one mass, moving of its own force towards the edge of the tracks in anticipation.\
  \ Elbows dug into me, hands pulled me back, and feet trampled over mine as the masses\
  \ surged towards the still-moving train. I started shoving and pushing to get a\
  \ hand on the railing where people were hanging off. I regretted being so ruthless,\
  \ but I also felt empowered; I had to get onto that train.\n\nAfter I got my entire\
  \ body on board, I squished myself onto the corner of a seat next to a woman named\
  \ Sharoon. Over the course of three hours, we shared deeply. I told her about my\
  \ father\u2019s remarriage and my step-siblings. She told me about her tightly-knit\
  \ family and their plans to arrange her marriage soon. Once we arrived in Delhi,\
  \ she helped me find an auto rickshaw, we exchanged numbers, and I thought I would\
  \ never see her again.\n\nFour years later, I sat on the Delhi Metro - incognito\
  \ \u2013 with my brown face, kurti, and chappals no one even gave me a second glance.\
  \ All I had to guide me to Sharoon\u2019s home was a scrap of paper with the metro\
  \ stations I needed to go to, her number (but no phone), and address. In Noida,\
  \ it was by pure luck that I got into a shared auto with a woman who lived in the\
  \ same apartment complex as Sharoon. My companion pointed me in the direction of\
  \ Sharoon\u2019s apartment and I followed the numbers up to the top floor. As I\
  \ climbed the stairs, my mind raced through an inventory of all that had passed\
  \ since I had seen Sharoon last. We had barely kept in contact over the years. Would\
  \ she look the same? Did I accurately recall our conversation on the train?\n\n\
  Filled with nervous excitement, I reached her door \u2013 but it was padlocked.\
  \ Everything was dark. No shoes outside. Before I allowed myself to entertain the\
  \ idea that I was in the wrong place two hours away from Delhi, I asked the neighbors\
  \ for their phone. I dialed Sharoon\u2019s number and told her: I think I\u2019\
  m outside your home? She burst out laughing and told me, I had given up hope you\u2019\
  d come, I didn\u2019t hear from you. Just five more minutes. I sat down on the concrete\
  \ steps and reveled in the serendipity which had brought me there. If I hadn't bought\
  \ that platform ticket in Agra years ago and sat next to her, all of this around\
  \ me would be inaccessible. Even the apartments where I sat, stacked upon each other,\
  \ are labyrinths into lives unfathomable.\n\nAll night, Sharoon and I sat on the\
  \ bed in her tiny apartment and allowed the stream of four-years-worth of stories\
  \ to flow. Since we last met, I had uprooted my life twice to different continents.\
  \ In that time, Sharoon had been married and divorced. I slept there, and when Sharoon\
  \ woke before dawn for her morning prayer, I opened my eyes and forgot for a moment\
  \ where I was. I felt like an insignificant yet blessed, cherished fleck in the\
  \ greater landscape of a city and even the subcontinent. \n\nMy travels have never\
  \ resulted in finding myself. Traveling in India always means losing myself and\
  \ being surprised to later see where my encounters lead me. I felt removed from\
  \ my own reality, transplanted by an unlikely friendship into another person\u2019\
  s life, even if just for a night. In soft haze of dawn\u2019s light, I saw Sharoon\
  \ prostrated on her mat towards Mecca. I wondered what she was saying to Allah."
