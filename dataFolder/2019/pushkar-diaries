Text: "Proximity to Delhi NCR and a wonderful connectivity  via all means of transport,\
  \ could be one of the reasons why I have frequented Rajasthan more often than any\
  \ other state.\n\nDuring one of the many extended weekends in 2017, it was on 29th\
  \ September that my wife, Panvi, and I set out for our second expedition in Rajasthan\
  \ \u2013 after having been pleasantly surprised by Udaipur the previous year. Our\
  \ plan was to set off for Pushkar, spend a solitary night there and leave for Jaipur\
  \ the next day, where we would spend a major share of our time. But little did I\
  \ know that we would be left longing for more and contemplated on extending our\
  \ stay. Such was the connect we made with the city within a day.\n\nPushkar is the\
  \ only city in the world which has a Lord Brahma temple, revered as Creator of all\
  \ beings in Hindu texts. It is in fact also known as \u201CTirtha-Raj\u201D (The\
  \ most important Pilgrimage for Hindus). The highlight of the city, around which\
  \ most of the tourism revolves, is the Pushkar lake. The Holy lake has 52 \u201C\
  Ghats\u201D (Series of steps leading down to a waterbody \u2013 mostly a lake or\
  \ a river) where pilgrims arrive in large numbers to take a bath. It is believed\
  \ that a dip in the water cleanses you of the sins and cures skin diseases. It surprised\
  \ me when one of the staff members of Hotel Pushkar Palace (our accommodation in\
  \ the city; located adjacent to the lake) told me that people from all religions\
  \ and beliefs visit the lake and take a bath. More than 500 temples of varying sizes\
  \ are located around the lake \u2013 inviting a plethora of pilgrims throughout\
  \ the year.\n\nBut the alleys of Pushkar hold much more for its tourists than temples.\
  \ It is a city where cultures converge. Where tradition meets change. That while\
  \ you would wake up to the sound of Prayers and Hymns in different temples, you\
  \ may end up listening to classic rock music of 70s and 80s being played across\
  \ different bars & pubs in the city. While you may not find a Hard Rock Caf\xE9\
  \ there, you are unlikely to miss out on Pushkar\u2019s very own Heart Rock Caf\xE9\
  .\n\nBeing foodies, we had done our thorough research on not missing out on places\
  \ worth visiting to grab a bite or two. La Pizzeria was our first stop in search\
  \ of our first meal in the city. Several eateries and shops in the town had their\
  \ menu, item and price lists written in Hebrew, apart from English of course. Pushkar,\
  \ as we found out, is one of the preferred destinations of people who travel to\
  \ India from Israel. And that\u2019s where the beauty of this city lies. While it\
  \ holds sacred importance for those who travel there for religious purposes, the\
  \ sheer stillness and tranquil nature of Pushkar attracts those who want to break\
  \ away from hustle bustle of a metropolitan city. You will witness saree clad women\
  \ with their heads covered and then there would be foreigners roaming in the city,\
  \ wearing clothes which a lot many Indians would consider brave even in bigger cities.\
  \ But it doesn\u2019t bother anyone there. No eyebrows are raised, no comments passed,\
  \ no judgement or anything which would affect the fabric of this city. Pushkar soaks\
  \ in all the ingredients, everybody pours in it and serves a dish which suits every\
  \ pallet.\n\nSit by the lake side, do some local shopping, visit the almighty (if\
  \ that\u2019s your calling), enjoy an evening at Pink Floyd Caf\xE9, sip your coffee\
  \ there on a rooftop \u2013 it would seldom taste better in your cubicle or in the\
  \ living room. Oh, if you look up, you will definitely witness stars in the sky,\
  \ a sight which is becoming a rarity for us, Delhiites.\n\nWhile Pushkar is a different\
  \ sight during its Annual Fair, there is a lot one can experience even during the\
  \ quiet days. This is a place where you may not need alcohol to have a heart to\
  \ heart talk with your loved ones. The sheer high in the air will allow you transcend\
  \ your emotions into words."
