Text: "Culture in every country has different, but how we choose the right culture\
  \ in a country if it have too many culture who grown up on there? So, I want to\
  \ describe how culture walk together in the differences in Singapore. This small\
  \ country in ASEAN have many different culture where it comes from different country.\
  \ Chinese, India, Malay, and other small part from Europe. As long as you walk or\
  \ traveling in here, you can feel different atmosphere from every station. As you\
  \ know, the name of station in here reflection from the culture on thats area, such\
  \ as when you come to the Dakota Station you can felt it in the Dakota on the America\
  \ or when you come to the Chinese Garden you can see some temple or decoration like\
  \ as in China. It\u2019s such amazing little town. Some building and wall on there\
  \ have been painted with full colors which it make you feel free to take pictures\
  \ in here.\nBig part of Singapore\u2019s citizens are mostly Chinese people, so\
  \ you\u2019ll found them everywhere when you come here, although they Chinese people\
  \ but not reflection they\u2019re rich people. They have different jobs, direction\
  \ for their life, and ages. So each of them have aim for make this country be a\
  \ strongest business in ASEAN. Cause it strategic location, Singapore be country\
  \ for transit some logistic which comes from the other country and distribute them\
  \ to ASEAN. And when you have plans to study in this country, you must learn about\
  \ English language cause it not use Chinese language although citizen in here using\
  \ Chinese language for daily life. It just secret, Chinese languages for communication\
  \ in Singapore have different with Chinese Country. So, sometimes you\u2019ll make\
  \ confuse if it different meaning. Nah, about moslem religion in here have been\
  \ brought by Malay\u2019s people, they come from Indonesia, Malaysia, Arab, India,\
  \ and some country where they make community, so it have Halal standard for everything.\
  \ . \nAh, I\u2019m almostly forget about India\u2019s people in this town. Don\u2019\
  t worry about face of India\u2019s people when you see them. They so kind person.\
  \ Mostly they stay on Little India and you can windows shoping of some stuff for\
  \ India\u2019s people pray such as flower, oil, perfume, textiles, and accesories\
  \ what you like. Characteristic building for pray of them also build in here, so\
  \ unique. Some painting which it paint about India also drawing with so beauty in\
  \ almost wall on there. You can eat of food with India taste like as Laksa and Curry,\
  \ the smell of them so make us really walk in the India\u2019s in reality. \nLike\
  \ what I write in the paragraph before about Singapore be strongest country in the\
  \ economic and business sector, it show with their money and how expensive everything\
  \ in here. About food, accommodation, recreation place and also something what you\
  \ like. But, it\u2019s okay if you want upgrade about your mindset and knowledge\
  \ cause in the small town like here have better technology where you can\u2019t\
  \ find on the ASEAN country such as unique architecture, international standard\
  \ about building and transportation. If you lucky, you\u2019ll see beauty red moon\
  \ in here, why I said it lucky? Because the red moon in here was really have red\
  \ color, don\u2019t scary with it please.  \n If we talk about temperature in here,\
  \ normally you\u2019ll find temperature more high than other ASEAN country so you\
  \ need for protect your skin from sun bright. But don\u2019t worry if you stay or\
  \ work in here. Buildings for work, transportations, and stations have air conditioner\
  \ to relax yourself from high temperature. Meanwhile, in some condition when you\
  \ find yourself tired after walks for hours, you can try bread ice cream with price\
  \ SG$1 and it have some flavor like as green tea, vanilla, strawberry, chocolate,\
  \ melon or jackfruit, how cheap it\u2019s not? For your information, Singapore the\
  \ one country where human resource in here better than other country and also be\
  \ most peace country in the world. So, when you have planning for life in here for\
  \ long time, you can choose this country."
