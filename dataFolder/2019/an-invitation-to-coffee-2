Text: "\u201CThey will see!\u201D \nHere flies a t-shirt, that was meant to land right\
  \ on the bottom of the suitcase, as if it was a plane going from Paris to London.\
  \ \n\u201CI will\u2026 show them all!\u201D\nThe snickers have knocked down the\
  \ t-shirt, that could not get to its destination on its own without having a charter\
  \ on the suitcase\u2019s wall.\n\u201CI! I!\u201D\nNow I have finally threw my own\
  \ self, but on the chair. I was tired from my own anger and also a little bit overwhelmed\
  \ from my own self-confidence. But still very stubborn and determined. My father\
  \ just stood there in the hallway and smiled at me. \u201CFinally got out of breath?\u201D\
  \ he asks, as I nod without letting him finish his sentence. \u201CDon\u2019t forget\
  \ to print your tickets.\u201D I have been travelling for years and I have never\
  \ for once been asked to show my electronic ticket, yet my parents still want me\
  \ to have it. \u201CI didn\u2019t. It is in my passport.\u201D \u201CGood. Good.\u201D\
  \ says he, as he goes back to his room.\nThe next morning I have already waiting\
  \ for my plane to Budapest, full of hopes and overweight carry-on bags. I was proud,\
  \ determined and\u2026 scared. I was leaving everything I had: my family, my dogs,\
  \ my bookcases, that cannot be opened without killing someone with the second volume\
  \ of Leo Tolstoy flying from the top shelf, and my whole, quite happy, life. I was\
  \ moving to the city I have never been to, to the people that have actually decided\
  \ to finance my education, which my country didn\u2019t want to do. Aside from my\
  \ anger, I was excited to finally travel even more. With times it truly became somewhat\
  \ of an addiction. Once you start taking yourself around the globe, you cannot help\
  \ it, but desire to do it more and more often. You go back home, tell yourself that\
  \ your will go somewhere as soon as your finances will allow you to do so, but will\
  \ surely find yourself watching time-lapses of Tel-Aviv at three o\u2019clock at\
  \ night. \nAnd now, Budapest, here I come! As soon as my plane takes off from the\
  \ ground of Moscow, I already start to feel the change. The wait is the most painful\
  \ thing ever, when you are so ready to start everything from the scratch.\nFerenc\
  \ Liszt Airport, the long wait on the passport check, some overpriced airport water\
  \ and now I am finally out. Smelling the Hungarian air. Standing on a Hungarian\
  \ ground. Hearing Hungarian swearwords as I realize that I am standing on the way.\
  \ Dragging my Russian heavy luggage across the city, just to get to the dormitory.\
  \ When you don\u2019t know the way, every bus stop is taking forever and truly seems\
  \ miles away. Once I get to my new home, I decide to test-drive my new bed right\
  \ away. And nothing else matters but the feeling of starting a new chapter and seeing\
  \ the Sun from another side of the world.\nNext morning starts will fear. It is\
  \ the realization of what you have done. The realization that you left everything\
  \ and have nothing. \u201CI'm just too much a coward To admit when I'm in need,\
  \ I took a walk\u201D \u2013 Passion Pit, 3:26. The true Shakespeares of our generation.\
  \ Besides, taking a walk is always a good idea.\nI always start off with the downtown.\
  \ The funny thing that I am always trying to do is me, trying to appear as less\
  \ touristy as possible. Acting like I know the way and getting lost near the National\
  \ Museum, desperately trying to find the door that doesn\u2019t say \u201CStaff\
  \ only\u201D. My Hungarian is still rusty, and most of locals prefer to switch to\
  \ English, they don\u2019t want to hear their language being slaughtered the Russian\
  \ way. But you know me, I am dedicated. I am no fool to give up that easily. I will\
  \ not just become a local in Budapest, but will also explore the whole country,\
  \ the way I coundn\u2019t do it with my own. I cannot wait to tell you my story\
  \ and bore you with my pictures.\nBut for now lets find a coffeeshop. Be my guest."
