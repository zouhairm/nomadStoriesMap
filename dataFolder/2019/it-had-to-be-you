Text: "The supernatural mischief of Iceland\u2019s surreal shores began shaping my\
  \ trip from the moment the plane\u2019s wheels left the ground. \n\nMy seatmate\
  \ grew up 30 minutes from my hometown. A former colleague with his family sat just\
  \ rows ahead and would share the same transatlantic flight home a week later. \n\
  \nHeightened by these coincidences, the ethereal rocky coastline near Keflavik Airport\
  \ blurred the lines between fantasy and reality. The sun peeked over distant mountains\
  \ with every expectation a dragon would emerge beyond the grim peaks silhouetted\
  \ against the dawn. The ground seemed to ooze mist, plumes of smoke disappearing\
  \ into gray sky. Seawater filled the air, deep and cleansing. \n\nI caught the bus\
  \ toward my Airbnb, a small studio overlooking a pier on the outskirts of Reykjavik.\
  \ Water lapped at the dock down a line of aluminum-covered row houses in various\
  \ pastel shades. A door featuring a particularly robust shade of blue led to a small\
  \ yellow room with a kitchenette and pretty white curtains framing full-length windows.\n\
  \nTurning on the faucet to brush my teeth sent shockwaves of volcanic sulfur like\
  \ putrid eggs through the small room. As I hastily turned off the water, a knock\
  \ came from the door. \n\nI opened it and greeted at a tall blonde with a friendly\
  \ smile. \n\n\u201CI heard you come in and wanted to say hello! I\u2019m Marlena.\u201D\
  \ The woman extended her hand. \u201CMy son owns this house and rents it out. But\
  \ my daughter and I live upstairs, so let me know if you need anything.\u201D\n\n\
  \u201CThank you!\u201D I dropped her hand and nodded toward the road. \u201CI\u2019\
  ll probably walk over to the supermarket soon for a couple of things I forgot to\
  \ pack.\u201D\n\n\u201COh, I was just headed out \u2013 could I give you a lift?\u201D\
  \n\nI smiled gratefully and promised to meet her by the car in a few minutes. As\
  \ we pulled onto the main road, passing green hillsides and blue skies flaunted\
  \ the ocean\u2019s shimmering hues.\n\n\u201CSo, have you ever been to Iceland before?\u201D\
  \ Her accent was pronounced but easily understood. \n\n\u201CNever. It\u2019s my\
  \ first time here.\u201D\n\n\u201CWell I hope you enjoy yourself. What are your\
  \ plans?\u201D I told her my anticipated itinerary and asked her if she had ever\
  \ been to the States. \n\n\u201CYes, actually. I worked for the State department\
  \ as a translator for about twenty years.\u201D \n\nNow Marlena\u2019s fluency in\
  \ English began to make more sense. \n\n\u201COh really! Whereabouts were you?\u201D\
  \n\nShe waved a hand dismissively. \u201COh, you probably wouldn\u2019t know it.\
  \ It\u2019s a town called Dearborn, in Michigan.\u201D\n\nI froze, heat piercing\
  \ my veins and ultimately uttered, \n\n\u201CI grew up in Dearborn.\u201D\n\nHer\
  \ eyes widened and she glanced at me. \u201CSeriously? Where did you live?\u201D\
  \ \n\nAfter naming the major intersection, she nodded. \u201CMy family and I lived\
  \ just a few blocks from there. Actually, my kids went to the high school nearby.\u201D\
  \n\nMy palms began to sweat. \u201CWhich high school?\u201D\n\n\u201COur Lady of\
  \ the Holy Child.\u201D\n\nI was now fully turned towards her in my seat, straining\
  \ at my seatbelt as I leaned back toward the window with a hand on my chest, completely\
  \ taken by this wholly unexpected turn of events. \u201CI went to that high school!!\u201D\
  \n\nBy this point we had turned into the parking lot of the grocery store. Marlena\
  \ parked the car at the curb and shot me a wary look.\n\nAfter a brief pause, we\
  \ deduced that my Airbnb host and I graduated from the same high school five years\
  \ apart, and his sister attended the school as a freshman while I was a senior before\
  \ the family moved back to Iceland. \n\nWe both paused and looked nervously at each\
  \ other. \n\n\u201CIt feels like we\u2019re long lost cousins or something,\u201D\
  \ I joked, hoping to erase some of the tension at meeting a perfect stranger whose\
  \ life so closely intersected with my own. \n\nMarlena grinned. \u201CWell you will\
  \ always be welcome to stay with us whenever you come back to Iceland.\u201D\n\n\
  I smiled back. After being in the country for only 6 hours, the impossible already\
  \ seemed possible \u2013 that seemingly unimaginable connection is truly just around\
  \ the corner. Over the hill, the sun mischievously winked on the water."
