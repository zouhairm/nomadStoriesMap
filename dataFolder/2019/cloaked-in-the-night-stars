Text: "A calm solitude washes over me at 30,000 feet in the darkest hour of the night,\
  \ racing towards a sunrise. With the dim cabin filled with muffled engines and the\
  \ rhythmic blinking of wing lights, the world pauses as the plane continues on.\n\
  \ \nMy life, through the virtue of work, had become too heavy to hold. It was now\
  \ a systematic study in attempting to keep away the sinking understanding that resiliency\
  \ is not everything and the universe does not in fact conspire in people\u2019s\
  \ favor - even when every effort is made. In the flickering lights outside my window,\
  \ I hoped to undress from these dense coats of life, if only for a weekend.\n \n\
  But on the ground the next morning, everything was out of control. Noah and I had\
  \ made plans and coordinated timing, but he was distraught and stranded in Tennessee.\
  \ I was alone at his mother\u2019s house watching as November storms rolled above.\
  \ And our mutual friend, Alex, was stuck in six hours of New York traffic coming\
  \ to get me in Delaware before we could meander our way to the Jersey Shore.\n \n\
  Through the windows of the car, the peninsula\u2019s perfect grid of streets seemed\
  \ eerie with of all the uncertainty we had encountered. The town was reminiscent\
  \ of New York, but instead of towering buildings, idealistic houses stood quiet\
  \ and deserted by summer tourists. Alex and I arrived at a small white house with\
  \ square yard that had a for sale sign stuck in the near-frozen grass. Sunlight\
  \ fell onto the street illuminating what was our barren beach house for the weekend.\n\
  \ \nThe euphoria of arriving gave way to the panic of realizing we had no heat,\
  \ no WiFi, and for a moment we thought, no hot water. In the cold haze, Alex and\
  \ I drank our fill to keep our blood warm and continued the frigid afternoon bundled\
  \ with a puzzle of three parrots in near silence for hours. Dinner was early so\
  \ we could crowd the stove to gain warmth, hovering our hands over the burners.\n\
  \ \nAfter, we walked the streets towards the beach. The wind became louder and so\
  \ did the ocean. The sand sloped gently towards the water, so unlike the rugged\
  \ coast I grew up on, wrapped in forest and cliffs. We drifted along the sand, full\
  \ of tears, reassurance, and the safety of each other.\n\u201CThere\u2019s Orion,\u201D\
  \ I said.\n\u201CAnd there\u2019s the Little Dipper,\u201D Alex replied.\nI couldn\u2019\
  t see it, blinded by my fascination with the larger constellations, but I wanted\
  \ to believe him that it was there.\n\u201CThe stars! What a magnificent creation\
  \ of this universe!\u201D he shouted to no one, his body frenetic and voice full\
  \ of elation. Maybe he spoke it to the ocean.\nOur eyes bright with wonder searched\
  \ the sky for shooting stars. We drifted over the horizon of dark waves, capped\
  \ by silvery collisions against the shore. And there, in that exact moment, a luminous\
  \ star shot across the sky. Bright and brilliant, leaving behind a fading orange\
  \ trail.\n \nMaybe we were staying in a freezing house, maybe all we had was a puzzle\
  \ of parrots, and maybe I couldn\u2019t escape the reality of my job, but in that\
  \ moment, everything became small in the face of such radiance. The universe could\
  \ tear things to shreds, but it filled the rest with gold.\n \nThe next night, I\
  \ stared out the plane window above the glimmering arteries of Philadelphia. The\
  \ stars holding steady above formed the Little Dipper, the constellation I had been\
  \ searching for with Alex yelling, thank you Universe into the darkness of the ocean.\
  \ On the beach I was bewildered by such exuberance towards something so unknown,\
  \ but now it began to make sense. We may not be able to control what the universe\
  \ hands us, but we can always be in awe of what we see."
