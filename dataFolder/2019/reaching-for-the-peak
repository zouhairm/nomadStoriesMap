Text: "I clawed my way up gently, persistently, enduringly. I was tired but I had\
  \ to make it to the top. I had promised myself that I would. When I came down to\
  \ this town on my vacation, I did not know I would be climbing a mountain soon.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t my idea at all. My face lit up when my host said they had a mountain\
  \ climbing adventure planned. I had never done that before. But it sounded like\
  \ it would be fun. We went as a team; every one of us was excited. The other eight\
  \ members of \u201CThe Clique\u201D knew each other before now. I was the stranger.\
  \ They were warm and I quickly felt like part of the group. I had this excited feeling\
  \ running down my spine the moment we were within reach of the mountain. I had seen\
  \ lots of them on my journey here. The highway was lined up with them. I had heard\
  \ mountain climbing stories too. But now, today, right at this moment, I was to\
  \ explore the possibility of getting to the mountaintop. For me, this was a lifetime\
  \ adventure.\n\nWe took pictures every step of the way and we were screaming away\
  \ when we got to the starting point. I had noticed since getting to this town that\
  \ places that were close to the mountains were cold at night and in the early mornings.\
  \ The cold was refreshing and it was usually a very pleasant break from the scorching\
  \ heat that characterized the town. We began barefooted. Some pilgrims on the mountains\
  \ had made it clear to us that this was their territory. \u201CIt was holy ground,\u201D\
  \ they said and made us pull our shoes. We soon left them behind as we came to the\
  \ next part of the mountain; the part that began our task. As I climbed now, I thought\
  \ of the obstacles and how overcoming them took a bit of work. It was invariably\
  \ mindless to think that challenges would take care of themselves. They never do.\
  \ It takes our genuine efforts to pull down the things that stop us.\n\nWe had gone\
  \ more than halfway before part of the team relented. At first, the mountain ground\
  \ was firm enough to catch our feet. When we passed the pilgrims however, we developed\
  \ a strategy. The men spread out across the pathway and passed the ladies to one\
  \ another in an attempt to pull each lady up. This worked out pretty well. We saw\
  \ the mountain goats pass in a convoy. This was their home. They made the journey\
  \ effortlessly. They seemed oblivious of our presence. We soon began to pull out\
  \ mountain shrubs before we could safely take the paths. The way up the mountain\
  \ was not clearly defined. There wasn\u2019t a marked pathway. Only our instincts\
  \ guided us on which parts were easier to take. The mountain was not so friendly.\
  \ It stopped gripping our feet almost as soon as it had started and we resorted\
  \ to crawling. The men were carrying all the bags by now. It was difficult terrain.\
  \ Soon, the ladies were tired and they suggested we stopped where we were. They\
  \ could not continue. The men wanted to make it to the mountaintop. It was not every\
  \ day that you go on a mountain climbing adventure. Now that we were here, why couldn\u2019\
  t we just make it to the peak? \n\n\u201CWe are seeing the mountaintop already,\u201D\
  \ Bliss said.\n\u201CIt\u2019s still way ahead. You will find that we are not close\
  \ at all as soon as you begin,\u201D Doreen said.\n\u201CWe would leave you here\
  \ then,\u201D Bliss said and looked to me for agreement.\n\u201CGo on then,\u201D\
  \ Doreen said and took a seat.\n\nThe other ladies joined her. So did two of the\
  \ guys. We were three left on the way to the mountaintop. We looked at each other\
  \ quietly and continued our climbing. The others were just so glad to wait for us.\
  \ Halfway through the rest of the climb, Felix relented as well. He needed rest.\
  \ I clawed on. I was relentless. When I finally reached the top, I met Bliss\u2019\
  \ waiting arms and then he gave me a warm kiss."
