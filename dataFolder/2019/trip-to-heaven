Text: "This is the story of one of the most risky trips, but at the same time, the\
  \ most incredible I've done. I was in the seventh semester of journalism. The TV\
  \ teacher asked us to create a great final report. My team and I decided to do something\
  \ different, then Emmanuel mentioned that he had a great friend living in Tamaulipas,\
  \ in northern M\xE9xico, and that he knew the longest man in the whole country.\n\
  \ \nAt that time, he was 104 years old, so we decided to go on an adventure. We\
  \ went at night in a truck from the Central Bus. The adrenaline started there: Once\
  \ entering Tamaulipas, in each small town we were stopped by armed checkpoints,\
  \ which climbed into the truck wearing a mask only their eyes were visible.\n \n\
  They brought a huge gun and vests, checked that all passengers brought identification.\
  \ Fortunately, nothing bad happened and we arrived at 7am, safe and sound to Jaumave,\
  \ Tamaulipas.\n \nIn order to reach El Cielo Ecological Reserve we had to enter\
  \ the Sierra Madre Oriental, which without a 4x4 is almost impossible. Luckily,\
  \ Bardo, Emmanuel's friend had one.\n \nWe prepare everything necessary before undertaking\
  \ the adventure. The trip began with reggae music in the background for almost 5\
  \ hours on the road.\n \nBardo was in charge of the wheel, on whom we all depended.\
  \ If he got lost, no one else could know how to get there. \U0001F92F We passed\
  \ by road, then desert and at the end we climbed to the highest point of the mountain,\
  \ where the landscape gave us the most beautiful views of one of the most violent\
  \ states in Mexico that, sadly, has been displaced from tourism by the issue of\
  \ organized crime.\n \nHalfway through, we all ran out of cell phone signal. I realised\
  \ that we entered a world where technology didn't take place. We started to descend\
  \ to the other side of the mountain, where the path was marked again. In that moment\
  \ the soul returned to me. We were not lost.\n \nAmong the 144,530 hectares of the\
  \ El Cielo Biosphere, there is a place without a name or street where approximately\
  \ 15 owners live there with their family. They prepared our horses, one for each\
  \ one, also we were expecting 10 chickens marinating in hot sauce to be able to\
  \ make them to the firewood. We brought groceries and enough beer for everyone.\n\
  \nThey have grown in El Cielo since several generations ago, without having electric\
  \ power. They create their own world without laws or authorities. They even have\
  \ their own music that tells their personal stories. In northern Mexico they are\
  \ called \"corridos\". They plant and raise their own food, they have a school but\
  \ not every day they have class because the teacher, who comes from Jaumave, is\
  \ not always easy to reach.\n \nIt was very impressive for me to see that they knew\
  \ almost nothing of what was happening outside.\n \nOn the third day in the El Cielo\
  \ Biosphere, Tamaulipas, Don Nato, the longest man in Mexico, was waiting for us\
  \ at his home to be interviewed. His wife, Mrs. Jacilda, 83, helped us to ask him\
  \ closer to his ear to answer all our doubts.\n \nHe talked about his past and how\
  \ quiet it feels to be at home. We asked him how he arrived at that healthy and\
  \ strong age. He told us that he simply enjoyed every moment of life and loved.\
  \ With his wife he has been together for more than 40 years and love was evident\
  \ among them.\n \nThey gave us a tour of their house, they showed us the most precious\
  \ memories of their past and, in the end, they gave us pumpkin candy with brown\
  \ sugar.\n \nWe returned healthy, safe and happy to have achieved the goal of the\
  \ trip. The great report that we presented to the professor, he liked so much that\
  \ he spoke of our work in other classes of generations before ours.\n \nThe career\
  \ of journalism was fundamental in my decision to make traveling my profession.\
  \ Telling stories of people who make places something special, the traditions and\
  \ customs of a culture. It is my greatest passion."
