Text: "For some, the idea of living out of a backpack and sharing a dorm bedroom with\
  \ 9 strangers from all over the world may not be the ideal vacation.  For me, however,\
  \ it opened my eyes to an entirely new way of traveling. Others may complain about\
  \ their roommates snoring or borrowing their clothes without asking but after sharing\
  \ a room with 9 guys, whom I hardly knew, things were quickly put into perspective.\
  \ \nDespite the questionable roommates, New Zealand is truly a first-time backpackers\
  \ dream. As one of the unfortunate souls that suffers from travel anxiety, I was\
  \ relieved when I found myself so comfortable in the easy-going lifestyle of Kiwi\u2019\
  s. Originally from the bustling city of Los Angeles, New Zealand gave me a glimpse\
  \ of a humbling lifestyle still full of adventure that suited me far better than\
  \ LA ever could. The caring, welcoming impression of the locals provided me with\
  \ a heartwarming sense of safety. Throughout the country, you can see carefree people\
  \ hitchhiking to their next adventure-filled destination. In all my time in New\
  \ Zealand, I was never stuck on the side of the road for more than five minutes\
  \ without a kind Kiwi stopping to make sure I was safe and offering to help me with\
  \ my car troubles (which, thanks to my lack of vehicular knowledge, happened more\
  \ times then I care to admit).\nAotearoa, as the Maori call it, truly has something\
  \ for everyone. Growing up in Southern California, I was familiar with the concept\
  \ of being able to surf and ski in the same day. New Zealand offers the same experience\
  \ but without the eight-hour drive and nightmarish traffic. The snow bunnies can\
  \ grab their skis or snowboard and hit the fresh snow on either the North or South\
  \ Island. If you\u2019re like me and prefer a beach side stay, black, white, or\
  \ golden sand beaches are never more than two hours away. The problem then becomes\
  \ deciding where to begin. Interested in getting a workout in while you\u2019re\
  \ away? New Zealand has more hikes than one person could possibly accomplish. Whether\
  \ you want to let out your inner Hobbit and conquer the daunting eight-hour hike\
  \ to Mount Doom, or just appreciate what Aotearoa has to offer with a simple walk\
  \ through the bush, this country accommodates all preferences.\n The North Island\
  \ has a tropical feel with warm salty air and long stretches of green rolling hills\
  \ between beautiful beach towns. While on the North Island, I was convinced that\
  \ there couldn\u2019t be such a variety of beautiful sites anywhere else in the\
  \ world. This briefly held true for about three weeks before I crossed the Cook\
  \ Strait over to the South Island. From walking along the golden sand beaches of\
  \ Abel Tasman, to standing in awe of the properly named Remarkables Mountain Range,\
  \ each stop left me bewildered by its grandeur. I fell in love with Queenstown,\
  \ a small town with a big personality that is rightfully referred to as \u201CThe\
  \ Adventure Capital of the World\u201D. I was able to experience this firsthand\
  \ while gracelessly bungee jumping off the very bridge where the sport was invented.\
  \ \nNew Zealand showed me that I wanted traveling to be more than just a hobby-\
  \ but a lifestyle. It was here that I realized I was not confined to live a certain\
  \ way and that I was happier living a less conventional life. Eight months after\
  \ I returned home, I found myself back in \u201CThe Land of the Long White Cloud\u201D\
  \ having made a more permanent move. I started a job at the bungee jumping company\
  \ that helped me conquer my fear of heights and continued to explore all that the\
  \ country has to offer. It\u2019s been over two years now since I moved to New Zealand.\
  \ Although my time here has been amazing the urge to travel has caught up with me\
  \ once again. New Zealand provided me with a sense of community in a place so distant\
  \ and different from the community I had grown up in. While living out of a backpack\
  \ in a room with 9 strangers from all over the world, I never expected to find myself\
  \ at home."
