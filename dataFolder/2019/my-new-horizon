Text: "Inca Trail\n\nThe alarm of the fourth and last day sounds really early, long\
  \ before dawn.\nOnly the \u201Cmate de coca\u201D could help me. Fatigue really\
  \ begins to be felt, but emotion prevails over everything.\nI hurl myself quickly,\
  \ I put everything in my backpack with a not exactly meticulous care. Boots, rackets\
  \ and out of the tent.\nWe have to do a long line and wait almost two hours before\
  \ finally entering the sanctuary of Machu Picchu. Who first comes will have the\
  \ opportunity to enjoy the sunrise from the Sun Gate and we certainly do not want\
  \ to miss this incredible experience.\nAfter the careful bureaucratic checks, various\
  \ tickets and documents, we finally begin to walk for the last hours of this incredible\
  \ journey.\nIt's dark and with my head lamp I feel perfectly in tune with the environment.\
  \ All waiting to arrive where the sun rises.\nMachu Picchu is translated from the\
  \ ancient Quechua language as \"Old Mountain\".\nThe great king Pachacutec chose\
  \ to build the city at an altitude of 2430 meters, in the R\xEDo Urubamba valley.\n\
  Traditionally considered a political, religious and administrative center, but no\
  \ one can confirm with certainty the real function of the Inca citadel.\nThus, hidden\
  \ from the sight of the common man, Machu Picchu was never discovered and destroyed\
  \ by the Spanish empire. After the end of the empire, everything was preserved and\
  \ preserved.\nUnfortunately, most of the temples and cities were looted and then\
  \ knocked down by the Spaniards and so all the gold was stolen and stolen.\nMachu\
  \ Picchu remained surrounded by vegetation, protected by its Andes and even today\
  \ nobody knows where the gold of the citadel is hidden.\nProbably, as many claims,\
  \ everything is preserved in the depths of the Peruvian jungle, unexplored and uncontaminated.\
  \ All the riches protected and collected in one place. A lost city that they call\
  \ El Dorado.\n\n                                                               \
  \                                                             ***\nIt begins to\
  \ be light around us and the light mist of the morning fades slowly.\nWe are almost\
  \ there and here is the long, steep and exhausting stone staircase that separates\
  \ us from the much-desired Gate of the Sun.\nIt's almost dawn and I cannot wait\
  \ any longer, I cannot think I'm tired, I cannot stop to rest, or eat. I just have\
  \ to get up, I want to go up.\nEight months to organize this trip, a difficult path\
  \ to get to this point. This precise moment. My big dream that I have to realize.\
  \ Never been so close, never been more excited.\nStill few stairs, so steep as to\
  \ rest your hands on the ground. It is the last effort.\nStop, pause, silence. No\
  \ more around me. Nobody talks, everyone is there to stand still. The most beautiful\
  \ show in the world. Here is my wish fulfilled, here it is finally dawn.\nThe sun\
  \ rises slowly on this cold May day and there is no cloud. All perfect. Machu Picchu\
  \ is finally my new horizon.\nThrough the Sun Gate, I lean against the walls for\
  \ fear of falling. My legs tremble and my knees creak, I crouch on a rock but never\
  \ look away.\nI take a breath and then nothing, I smile and ... I cry.\nWhen we\
  \ say happiness!\n[...] I take some pictures and I still stroke a few lamas before\
  \ leaving this extraordinary place of inspiration.\nBefore leaving, I stop by a\
  \ young man holed up in a tiny wooden box office, which with his stamp, leaves free\
  \ images of Machu Picchu on passports. A further proof of having succeeded. This\
  \ time only for myself.\nMachu Picchu unbalanced all my certainty about beauty.\
  \ The perfection of an ancient civilization, the immense connection with nature,\
  \ the meticulous participation in daily activities, the belief in mysticism and\
  \ the profound enjoyment of life.\nA set of emphasis, enthusiasm, disbelief and\
  \ emotion that still pervades me despite having now fallen from the mountains of\
  \ wonders.\nSo strong that almost a tear drops lightly to stain my face covered\
  \ with dust and earth.\n\"Do not think about the past, follow your dreams and if\
  \ you can, make them come true\".\nLiving the life, and it's just the beginning!\n\
  ...Easter Island is waiting from me..."
