Text: "NUMB TANTRUMS was becoming a book, the words were done but for the love of\
  \ gritty imagery, Ahmed and I decided to take the trip to Ake, Abeokuta in Ogun\
  \ State for the Book Festival. It was going to be like a hollow tip bullet going\
  \ through a window pane right before it connects with the intended victim, also\
  \ for fun\u2019s fucking sake, road trips are the shit.\nWe planned well enough\
  \ for the experience not to go to shit, so the day came and we linked up at Abule\
  \ Oja, I copped some buds and after a bit of delay we set out. Getting to Ojota\
  \ wasn\u2019t difficult but it turned that we got there late. There were no more\
  \ cars going to Ake from there. While in the process of figuring out our next move,\
  \ the skies started crying and on God, it was some fuck shit. We asked around and\
  \ got information that Mile 12 was our only other option so we took a bus there.\
  \ The time was around 7pm thereabout. At Mile 12, we found possibly the last car\
  \ going to Ake that day and we hopped in. I can\u2019t remember much in the car\
  \ because I was on some sleep ting but I somehow knew it took almost forever because\
  \ of the traffic that night. Anyway, the car passed the venue for the festival we\
  \ had to track back.\n\nWe got there, signed in, met a couple of friends and went\
  \ into this hall that had a play showing. It was cool and shit, a passionate cast\
  \ and a mostly fancy audience\u2026 Blah blah blah. Somehow, I got bored and stepped\
  \ out with my mans, for me it was more like a cigarette break.\n\nSome grown man\
  \ type of dude walked up to me and asked for a cigarette and I gladly obliged. It\
  \ just felt right to temporarily stop wondering if Putin pooed on teens and make\
  \ a conversation with a stranger who craved nicotine. We served the same master\
  \ so yeah, we can definitely find shit to talk about. Somehow, we didn\u2019t even\
  \ go there, maybe because we both knew that conversations about cigarette addictions\
  \ are clich\xE9s or maybe because, out of respect, you don\u2019t talk about the\
  \ master when he\u2019s right there in front of you.\nA minute dun flew past and\
  \ it turns out this gentleman who goes by the name, Akin-Coker is a theatre enthusiast.\
  \ Cool yeah? So midway, it hit me that I should record what was being said. It went\
  \ like this:\n\n*****Audio*****\n\nAfter hanging for a bit, we exited the damn place\
  \ to find a place to sleep. I was somewhat absent-minded for the rest of the trip,\
  \ didn\u2019t care about much except getting the hollow-tipped bullet to say Konnichiwa\
  \ to the target, I mean all I wanted some nice photos for my poetry collection,\
  \ NUMB TANTRUMS. Anyway, fast forward to a few days later back in Lagos, I could\
  \ hear Akin-Coker voice basking in the glory faux afro-beat melodies.  It all happened\
  \ in 2017 but I still hear it sometimes, these days."
