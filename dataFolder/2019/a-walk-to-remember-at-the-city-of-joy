Text: "When i landed at Kolkata i was so curious to find out why Kolkata is known\
  \ as\u201CCity of Joy\u201D. I found many answers to that question which made so\
  \ fall in love with the city-people living there. Even the airport has greeted me\
  \ well with stunning arts. \nI found impressive reviews about \"Hotel-Galaxy at\
  \ Park Street. So i booked a cab (an yellow Ambassador). The Hotel was managed by\
  \ a Veteran Punjabi Uncle, who refused to permit me a room in the beginning as he\
  \ prefer only family or tourists from abroad. But when he came to know the cause\
  \ of my expedition he was very welcoming & advised me to stay as long as i wish\
  \ to. I strongly recommend people to stay at \u201CHotel-Galaxy\u201D if you've\
  \ plans to visit Kolkata as it's very special. I don\u2019t have plans to disclose\
  \ about how my stay was, but you better be-curious&explore the place. And there\
  \ was something spray painted on the entrance of the motel which is \"*********\"\
  \  & i was confused after reading it but i'll definitely realize it before i leave\
  \ this place. So settled-down & rushed into the streets of Joy. Kolkata is entirely\
  \ different from other metropolitan cities in India. The glimpse of British ruled\
  \ Calcutta is still visible in many parts of the city especially at the Park Street\
  \ which is one of the busiest streets with street shops, eateries at every corner.\
  \ With its knick-knack traders & vendors backing a walk through ParkStreet would\
  \ take you back to the 80s&90s reminiscent of nostalgic India. This iconic street\
  \ is the soul-heart of the city. \nAnd the next morning, i thought of having a spiritual\
  \ beginning & therefore planned to visit \u201CThe Kalighat Temple\u201D. I chose\
  \ the journey by metro rail .The temple is visited by pilgrims from all over India\
  \ irrespective of sectarian differences.The thousands of pilgrims who flock daily\
  \ to the temple and is crowded most days. I got down at the nearest metro station\
  \ & walked towards the temple. It takes 5minutes to travel from metrostation to\
  \ the temple by-foot. Through my journey to-the temple i was heart-broken&dejected\
  \ by the scenes which i witnessed at the streets&footpath. The slum where children\
  \ cry for food, babies howl for milk  while their parents busy with their daily\
  \ activities like fast food eateries ,ironing clothes for the wealthy ,collecting\
  \ the plastics&wastage's. And i was thinking this mustn't be the right path towards\
  \ the holy temple & all my positive energy was vanished after this but i didn\u2019\
  t loose hope as i was thinking the presence of Devi(Goddess) would help me to overcome\
  \ from this melancholic situation. So atlast i reached the temple-compound,i was\
  \ abit confused with the procedure-rituals which needs to be followed . AsSoonAs\
  \ i entered was dragged & forcefully accompanied by the some priests(they call themselves\
  \ as Priests)&deliberately made me to buy the coconuts sweets&some other stuffs.\
  \ I asked them the cost of these but they told me its very less near to Rs50. They\
  \ did some drama & the guide took me inside the temple where i was asked to pay\
  \ more money to different persons which they called as swamy's/deity in exchange\
  \ of blessing. The guide asked me to do some pooja\u2019s but i refused & told him\
  \ that why should i pay a huge amount of money to get blessings&i told him that\
  \ i wanted to see the Lord ( Devi Darshan) & was too angry&fed up with the situation.\
  \ Finally i left the place without Devi darshan(without having a glimpse at the\
  \ Goddess)&atlast they demanded Rs1000-2000& showed me a fake invoice. I was pissed-off\
  \ & was in a quarrel with them for some time&threw some money at them & left the\
  \ place \u201CBROKEN\u201D, broken at the \u201CCity Of Joy\u201D. And that's the\
  \ reason why this short-part of my kolkata-diaries is called \"The Slum is outside\
  \ but the Beggars are Inside the temple in form of priests\". \nAnd i also visited\
  \ few other places in the city&had exceptional experiences too. Calcutta taught\
  \ me many lessons which i would keep&nurture in my soul. But i will share the key\
  \ note to all who read this blog. \n\"You live only once,so do make the most of\
  \ it\"  was spray painted at the entrance of \"Hotel Galaxy\" where i stayed."
