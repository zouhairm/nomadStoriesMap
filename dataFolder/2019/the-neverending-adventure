Text: "Time and expectations should be part of your memories, not the journey itself.\n\
  \nAfter meeting with my fellow adventurers for breakfast, we set off on our 326-kilometre\
  \ journey to Quy Nhon through winding roads of the Vietnamese landscape on our motorbike\
  \ convoy.\n\nOur first stop was in Hoi An, a quaint lovable town that is rapidly\
  \ becoming Vietnam\u2019s most-loved travel destination.\n\nStocked up on water,\
  \ we were ready to hit the road, however, there was one problem: one of the bikes\
  \ wouldn\u2019t start. We called the rental service but the English-speaking staff\
  \ member had left. The only solution was to get one of the nearby restaurant owners\
  \ involved, to discover that the bike had a safety lock that prevented the bike\
  \ from starting if the kickstand was down. It was.\n\nCrisis averted, we were good\
  \ to go. Travelling through Hoi An, locals would constantly try to divert us to\
  \ tourist destinations, assuming we were going in the wrong direction. When we saw\
  \ the large bridge lay in front of us, we knew we were departing from Hoi An and\
  \ into the unknown. \n\nA sea of rice paddies in a vibrant green hue on one side\
  \ and a river leading to the sea on the other, the morning sun was the extra magic\
  \ that created this the picture-postcard moment, as birds soared and the long stretch\
  \ of road opened up in front of us.\n\nAdrenaline is what makes driving 326km possible;\
  \ the sheer excitement of not knowing how the landscape will change, as we journeyed\
  \ further down the coast. Green turned to white mountains of Mars-like sand dunes\
  \ that created a never-ending otherworldly experience. Eventually reaching the first\
  \ city, it was 12 o\u2019clock and we\u2019d only done 100km. The sand dunes were\
  \ a bit of detour from the lightning speed highway. Unnecessary, yes, but totally\
  \ worth it. \n\nCentral Vietnam is incredible flat, open and windy: rice paddies\
  \ stretch for miles, some small villages do not appear until you see families emerging\
  \ for rice fields following a thin stretch of road that takes you to there. The\
  \ vibrant colours and simplicity to life make driving through this part of the world\
  \ humbling yet exhilarating. \n\nThe second stop was hunger-induced. There were\
  \ some signs on the street and tables out, so this was our chance. As we were travelling\
  \ on Tet Holiday (Vietnamese New Year) everything was closed: it\u2019s a time to\
  \ eat, drink and be happy with your family, not feed travellers. With no food to\
  \ be had, we were invited in and offered beer, Coca-Cola and a variety of sweeties.\
  \ Not exactly food, but the act of kindness and the sugar hit was appreciated. \n\
  \nThe next stop was close to 3 pm, the sun was starting to go down and we didn\u2019\
  t want to drive in the dark on a highway with buses and trucks that don\u2019t really\
  \ care about your tiny little motorbike. We found a corner shop that had some chairs\
  \ outside, the young lady who was running the show was incredibly accommodating\
  \ and agreed to make us some Hao Hao noodles. Excited about food, we pulled up a\
  \ seat, but not before we made eyes with the neighbour\u2019s baboon, chained up\
  \ so that he could not get over the fence. I was convinced he knew about the bananas\
  \ in my bag.\n\nAs we got into the mountains, we knew we weren\u2019t going to make\
  \ it before dark but the fear of not making it disappeared as we turn a corner to\
  \ see the sun was perched perfectly on top of a mountain. As the sky burst into\
  \ various shades of pink, the light cast beams onto the water of the lakes that\
  \ surrounded us, providing the last light of the day before we were plunged into\
  \ darkness.\n\nNow, we were faced with oppressive headlights and suddenly fast traffic,\
  \ to add to our increasingly unsafe situation, some people forgot about headlights\
  \ and there were no street lights. Hungry, tired and wishing that it would end,\
  \ the road descended down and the end of was in sight. Eventually, the city light\
  \ up the streets, 9 hours later."
