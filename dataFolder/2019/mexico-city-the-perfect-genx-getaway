Text: "With its mix of history and design, Mexico City is the destination for culture\
  \ and good food on every budget. The first thing to know, Mexico City in Spanish\
  \ is Ciudad de Mexico or CDMX in short. My four friends & I agreed on CDMX for our\
  \ getaway as it offered something different without taking us outside of our comfort\
  \ zones. The smartest strategy is to plan your itinerary around the city\u2019s\
  \ different areas and use Uber for getting around as it is safe and cheap. Here\
  \ are our three favourite neighbourhoods and the highlights of our adventures.\n\
  \n\nROMA NORTE & LA CONDESA\nLike the award-winning film, ROMA, the streets here\
  \ are lined with lush trees and the neighbourhood is now buzzing with cycling hipsters\
  \ and dotted with cute caf\xE9s and boutiques on every corner. Gorgeous colonial\
  \ buildings and churches juxtapose with low rise ultra-modern dwellings. The area\
  \ is the perfect walkable start to your vacation. You will feel right at home mingling\
  \ with the super friendly locals in no time.\n\nFavourite Style: 180 Shop- casual\
  \ men & women fashion & Casa Basques- trendy lifestyle of fashion, art & books\n\
  Favourite Value Eats: Ojo de Qua - healthy eats & juices\nFavourite Quick-Stop:\
  \ Rosetta Caf\xE9 - good coffee & tea blends with fresh baked goodies \nFavourite\
  \ Splurge: Contramar - Seafood with a Mexican twist\n\n\nCOYOACAN\nThe Frida Kahlo\
  \ museum, La Casa Azul, is a must.  Plan your day around this neighbourhood of museums,\
  \ galleries and markets. In the town centre, you can people watch as you sip margaritas\
  \ or wander and discover artisanal pottery and ceramics. Go in the earlier part\
  \ of the week and book your La Casa Azul tickets online in advance to avoid the\
  \ crowds and lineups.\n\nFavourite Style: La Casa Zaul, Frida Kahlo\u2019s wardrobe\
  \ collection\nFavourite Value Eats: Mercado de Cayoacan, taco & fruit juice stands\n\
  Favourite Quick-Stop:  Jardin Centenario, Coyote fountain \nFavourite Splurge: Tailler\
  \ Experimental de Ceramica, studio of the revered Alberto Diaz de Cossia\n\n\nPOLANCO\n\
  This is CDMX\u2019s Beverly Hills and the backdrop of Netflix\u2019s hit, Made in\
  \ Mexico. Similar to the Champs Elysees in Paris, Avenida Presidente Masaryk is\
  \ the home to the global luxury brands, and fashion faves like Zara. It feels unreal\
  \ as you watch the glamorous ladies who lunch with their designer-clad kids and\
  \ nannies in tow. A leisurely caf\xE9 society afternoon and the museum visit make\
  \ it worth the visit.\n\nFavourite Style: Stendhal, Mexican designer men & women\
  \ fashion\nFavourite Value Eats:  Amorino Gelato, the perfect me-moment from the\
  \ heat\nFavourite Quick-Stop:  Soumaya Museum, art collection of Mexico\u2019s richest\
  \ man, Carlos Slim \nFavourite Splurge: Pujo Restaurant, Mexican cuisine & Food\
  \ & Drink\u2019s 2017 World Best 50 restaurants\n\n\nADVENTURE: Day-Tripping to\
  \ UNESCO Heritage sites\nIf you haven\u2019t seen a pyramid in real life, do visit\
  \ Teotihuacan for the majestic structures with glorious views. Plan your three-hour\
  \ visit in the early morning as there is little shelter from the midday sun.  Remember\
  \ your S\u2019well bottles and wear sensible shoes, unlike me in my heeled American\
  \ Apparel sandals!\n\nMake your trip most memorable by spending Sunday on one of\
  \ the colourful trajineras along the canals of Xochimilco. You can enjoy the scenery\
  \ and interact with the vendors and artisans floating past. Take it up a notch and\
  \ hire a mariachi band onboard, which we did to celebrate a birthday. The afternoon\
  \ will definitely give you many Instagram-able moments. \n\n\nADVENTURE: NIGHT OUT\n\
  You can easily find & ask about cool bars and clubs. The one place you shouldn\u2019\
  t miss is the retro night at Patrick Miller. Even if you don\u2019t dance, it is\
  \ an all-night spectacle of old school dance-off circles. From hipster to old school\
  \ new wavers, the fierce but fun crowd is super mixed and friendly. Go early to\
  \ avoid the line-up -- it\u2019s all worth it!  \n\n\nCDMX will rejuvenate your\
  \ senses with its fantastic food and experiences.  It is perfect for those who want\
  \ culture and adventure in moderation. You should as we did, Airbnb a beautiful\
  \ design apartment or cool East Village style walk-up in Roma Norte or Polanco.\
  \ Don\u2019t forget to pack more than sweats and runners as the people are well-heeled\
  \ in the neighbourhoods you want to be!"
