Text: "The Atacama, a desert so diverse and expansive that you can you often find\
  \ yourself feeling adrift in an environment so foreign you begin to question if\
  \ you're still on your home planet... Of all the incredible natural phenomena I\
  \ experienced there I never expected to be so humbled by something so simple. \n\
  \nWhilst crossing the desert from Northern Chile into Bolivia I saw flocks of pink\
  \ flamingo numbering into the thousands on blood red lakes painted against snowcapped\
  \ Andean mountain ranges. I experienced the sunrise atop Incahuasi, an island of\
  \ giant cacti amidst Solar De Uyuni, one of the worlds largest salt flats. I was\
  \ wowed by natural thermal geysers, obelisk sized dunes and mars-like terrain in\
  \ Valley de Luna, \"The Valley of the Moon\". I had my gaze cemented to the sky\
  \ as I took in the countless constellations and solar spectacles of San Pedro. But\
  \ of all these experiences it was but a fleeting moment atop a single solitary rock\
  \ that stuck with me in an entirely different way... \n\nThe memory is still so\
  \ vivid, the feeling lingers in my subconscious, like the first time I rode a bike\
  \ without training wheels. We had been driving for hours in an old Toyota Land Cruiser,\
  \ battling the capricious and unforgiving terrain of the Atacama. The sun was low,\
  \ throwing a warm orange hue up from the foot of the pastel teal sky. The snowy\
  \ Andes falling into my periphery as we neared a seemingly infinite canyon encompassed\
  \ by a blanket of otherworldly rock formations. \n\nAs the hot rubber seal of the\
  \ door slowly parted ways with the worn body of the Land Cruiser a cool, yet dry\
  \ breeze rolled in over my skin like an ancient whisper from the wise old desert.\
  \ The energy here was different, it was raw and elemental. The land, still un-tarred\
  \ by human interference, stretched out beyond comprehension, muting any concept\
  \ of a world outside of this single place and time. \n\nThe rustle of hurried footsteps\
  \ shuffling along the dry crude earth were the only sounds to pierce the silence\
  \ of the desert as the group made their way toward a cliff edge to catch the setting\
  \ sun. I went to follow but something pulled me away. A distant rock peak caught\
  \ my eye and drew me toward it. The peak was at least a couple hundred metres away\
  \ and the sun was quickly making its descent, If i wanted to reach it in time for\
  \ the sunset i would have to make a break for it. I don't know what it was that\
  \ was pulling me but I couldn't ignore it so I started to run! The run quickly turned\
  \ to a sprint as I attempted to navigate the ancient rocky playground. With heavy\
  \ lungs and burning hamstrings I pulled myself to the top of the peak and gazed\
  \ down at my ant-like companions below. \n\nI let my wary legs hang from the edge\
  \ of the rock face over the snaking canyon beneath me and took in a deep nourishing\
  \ breath and closed my eyes, I wasn't alone. I could feel someone else there with\
  \ me.. It was my Grandad Brian. He'd passed away a few years back, a devastating\
  \ loss for me, he was my hero, a true explorer and my inspiration for travelling.\
  \ He was old, wise and well versed in the ways of the world just like the desert,\
  \ I guess it made sense in that way. I didn't really know what to make of his presence,\
  \ but it felt comforting and natural so i din't really question it. All I knew was\
  \ that I was right where i needed to be, completely in that moment, i was free.\
  \ \n\nI felt a single tear run down my cheek as I took in the beauty of the desert,\
  \ the suns diminishing light cast warm magenta brushstrokes over the mountains and\
  \ painted the valley a cool indigo in a dazzling display of colour i'd never been\
  \ privy to before. I spoke a few parting words to Grandad and felt the warm embrace\
  \ of his energy one last time before letting him return to the desert with the sun\
  \ and her light."
