Text: "As I walk through the famous Damascus gate into Jerusalem, I am greeted with\
  \ smells and textures, colors and noises not yet known to me.\nAs I walk through\
  \ the endless small corridors and walls I soon realize that its these walls, textures,\
  \ colors and smells that acts as a protective barrier drawing the occupants of this\
  \ ancient city together by their common religious heritage.\nIts important to note\
  \ that there is 3 religions coming together in the Old Town of Jerusalem who all\
  \ feel like they have a rightful place in this ancient holy land. Judaism, Islam\
  \ and Christianity, all crammed into a 0.9 square kilometer of ecclesiastical corners\
  \ and congested stalls and alleys. Since the beginning of time Jerusalem has been\
  \ subject to turf wars from the Babylonian time right through to Persian, Byzantine,\
  \ Roman and Crusaders alike, all bearing interest for the control of this city.\
  \ Even though it seems quiet as Im walking to the Kotel wall I am keenly aware of\
  \ the boiling pot of war that can break out in any given time.\nI walk past David\u2019\
  s City right as you enter the Old City and am immediately fascinated by a group\
  \ of young girls giggling and laughing with each other, but dressed in full military\
  \ uniforms. The juxtaposition between the two worlds startles me somewhat, but I\
  \ snap a photo of them and move along. (this image went on to be one of my favorite\
  \ travel images to date)\nAnother very important thing to note about being a photographer\
  \ in Jerusalem is, is that its considered exceptionally rude to take photos of Orthodox\
  \ Jews, they see it as a form of idolatry. Unfortunately I only learnt of this fact\
  \ when I got spit at by an orthodox Jew. Ive been in the Old City a total of 20\
  \ minutes and already had a few interesting experiences.\nAfter a few more turns\
  \ and bends I eventually reach the Western Wall. The wailings can be heard clearly\
  \ now, the pleas and petitions of those fortunate enough to make it to the front\
  \ of the wall to place their folded papers between the cracks in the wall. Its believed\
  \ that by this act your prayer is sure to be answered. Its also said to be one of\
  \ the \u201Cgates of heaven\u201D.\nApparently you can now email your requests and\
  \ someone will place it in the wall on your behalf, not sure how old testament priests\
  \ would have felt about this, but just another example of the absolute stark contrasts\
  \ between modern and old world in this city.\nThe combination of cries and the barbed\
  \ wire topped barrier dividing Israel from the West bank makes me feel slightly\
  \ nauseas and very uncomfortable and I remember the line from a Wizard of Oz where\
  \ Dorothy turns to Toto with the famous line \u201CToto, I've a feeling we're not\
  \ in Kansas anymore \u201C.\nThe presence of a Israeli Soldier with a AK 47 dressed\
  \ in civilian clothes acts as a reminder that people have died in demonstrations\
  \ against this wall\u2019s existence and confirms the ongoing conflict that Israel\
  \ lives under.\nThere is so much that I am still to learn about this fascinating\
  \ oxymoron of our time that to me its almost like peeling off layers. Layers of\
  \ tradition and culture yet covered in modernity and the quest to find a balance\
  \ between the two worlds. On the one end you are surrounded by masses of black suits,\
  \ the Orthodox choice of clothing for natives, but on the other end kids from these\
  \ families running around with traditional hairstyles of little locks of hair on\
  \ the sides of their heads playing Pokemon Go on their Ipads.\na World of extremes\
  \ is an understatement. Looking out onto the wall, I felt overwhelmed and not sure\
  \ whether I wanted to go and pray at the wall. I had to adjust to the assault of\
  \ senses I was experiencing.\nI realized that evening that even though we might\
  \ believe in different things, we are all drawn together by what seems to be a common\
  \ thread. a Need to be accepted and to believe in something bigger and more powerful\
  \ than ourselves."
