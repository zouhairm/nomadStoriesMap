Text: "Early examples of travel literature include Pausanias' Description of Greece\
  \ in the 2nd century CE, the Journey Through Wales (1191) and Description of Wales\
  \ (1194) by Gerald of Wales, and the travel journals of Ibn Jubayr (1145\u20131214)\
  \ and Ibn Battuta (1304\u20131377), both of whom recorded their travels across the\
  \ known world in detail. The travel genre was a fairly common genre in medieval\
  \ Arabic literature.[2]\n\nTravel literature became popular during the Song dynasty\
  \ (960\u20131279) of medieval China.[3] The genre was called 'travel record literature'\
  \ (youji wenxue), and was often written in narrative, prose, essay and diary style.[4]\
  \ Travel literature authors such as Fan Chengda (1126\u20131193) and Xu Xiake (1587\u2013\
  1641) incorporated a wealth of geographical and topographical information into their\
  \ writing, while the 'daytrip essay' Record of Stone Bell Mountain by the noted\
  \ poet and statesman Su Shi (1037\u20131101) presented a philosophical and moral\
  \ argument as its central purpose.[5]\n\nOne of the earliest known records of taking\
  \ pleasure in travel, of travelling for the sake of travel and writing about it,\
  \ is Petrarch's (1304\u20131374) ascent of Mount Ventoux in 1336. He states that\
  \ he went to the mountaintop for the pleasure of seeing the top of the famous height.\
  \ His companions who stayed at the bottom he called frigida incuriositas (\"a cold\
  \ lack of curiosity\"). He then wrote about his climb, making allegorical comparisons\
  \ between climbing the mountain and his own moral progress in life.\n\nMichault\
  \ Taillevent, a poet for the Duke of Burgundy, travelled through the Jura Mountains\
  \ in 1430 and recorded his personal reflections, his horrified reaction to the sheer\
  \ rock faces, and the terrifying thunderous cascades of mountain streams.[6] Antoine\
  \ de la Sale (c. 1388\u2013c. 1462), author of Petit Jehan\nTravel books come in\
  \ styles ranging from the documentary, to the literary, as well as the journalistic,\
  \ and from the humorous to the serious. They are often associated with tourism and\
  \ include guide books[14]. Travel writing may be found on web sites, in periodicals,\
  \ and in books. It has been produced by a variety of writers, including travelers,\
  \ military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, social and physical\
  \ scientists, educators, and migrants. Englishmen Eric Newby,[15], H. V. Morton,\
  \ the Americans Bill Bryson and Paul Theroux, and Welsh author Jan Morris are or\
  \ were widely acclaimed as travel writers (though Morris has frequently claimed\
  \ herself as a writer of 'place' rather than travel per se).[citation needed] Bill\
  \ Bryson in 2011 won the Golden Eagle Award from the Outdoor Writers and Photographers\
  \ Guild.[16] On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the Main\
  \ Library the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th\
  \ chancellor (2005\u201311).[17][18] Paul Theroux was awarded the 1981 James Tait\
  \ Black Memorial Prize for his novel The Mosquito Coast, which was adapted for the\
  \ 1986 movie of the same name. He was also awarded in 1989 the Thomas Cook Travel\
  \ Book Award for Riding the Iron Rooster. In 2005, Jan\n\nTravel and nature writing\
  \ merge in many of the works by Sally Carrighar, Gerald Durrell and Ivan T. Sanderson.\
  \ Sally Carrighar's works include One Day at Teton Marsh (1965), Home to the Wilderness\
  \ (1973), and Wild Heritage (1965). Gerald Durrell's My Family and Other Animals\
  \ (1956) is an autobiographical work by the British naturalist. It tells of the\
  \ years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek\
  \ island of Corfu between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family\
  \ in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and\
  \ most well-known of Durrell's \"Corfu trilogy\", together with Birds, Beasts, and\
  \ Relatives and The Garden of the Gods (1978). Ivan T. Sanderson published Animal\
  \ Treasure, a report of an expedition to the jungles of then-British West Africa;\
  \ Caribbean Treasure, an account of an expedition to Trinidad, Haiti, and Surinam,\
  \ begun in late 1936 and ending in late 1938; and Living Treasure, an account of\
  \ an expedition to Jamaica, British Honduras (now Belize) and the Yucat\xE1n. These\
  \ authors are naturalists, who write in support of their fields of study. Another\
  \ naturalist, Charles Darwin, wrote his famous account of the journey of HMS Beagle\
  \ at the intersection of science, natural history and travel.[23]"
