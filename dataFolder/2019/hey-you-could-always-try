Text: "Among the places we shall go, we are all destined to find ourselves lost in\
  \ translation. Standing at the information desk of Jose Marti International Airport\
  \ outside of Habana, Cuba the custodian of information can be forgiven for not knowing\
  \ I was asking if there was a water fountain nearby. It was obvious by his response,\
  \ on two occasions, that his English was as poor as my Spanish. Each time I asked\
  \ where I could find some water, he replied, sort of confoundedly, \u201CDeparture,\
  \ or Arrival?\u201D Without protestation, without frustration, I resigned myself\
  \ to the \u2018Departures\u2019 per his instruction and waited for my plane to arrive.\
  \ As I sat there listless and parched, instead of imaging the refreshment of cool\
  \ water fountains, I could only imagine how things may have been different, had\
  \ he been working the same desk seven days ago.\nHad I arrived in Habana seven days\
  \ prior, to this man instead of the women with whom I did speak\u2026Yes, I would\
  \ still have rented a car and drove across Jamaica from Montego Bay to Kingston.\
  \ All on the whim of the agent saying the flight to Habana, the only one for a week,\
  \ was fully booked, because she ended the call with these words, \u201CHey, you\
  \ could always try.\u201D\nAnd also, Yes, I would still have found myself sprinting\
  \ across the airport parking lot of Kingston because after a nine and half hour\
  \ wait, when the plane was fully checked in the flight attendant called me to the\
  \ desk and stated, \u201CSince we had one passenger not show up, I would like to\
  \ offer you their seat, but that means you have 15 minutes to return your rental\
  \ car, fill the gas, use the ATM on the other side of the airport. Which, by the\
  \ way, probably doesn\u2019t have any American currency in it, and Cuba will not\
  \ accept Jamaican currency. Then get back here in time to purchase this ticket,\
  \ that I will hold for you. All in time for boarding. Can you do that?\u201D To\
  \ which there was but one suitable reply. \u201CHey, I could always try.\u201D And\
  \ she wasn\u2019t lying, there was only $100 in the ATM. \nSo, there I am, in Habana,\
  \ Cuba. It\u2019s nearly 10pm and I have 150 American dollars in my wallet, no cellular\
  \ connection, despite what the gentleman at my local cellular service provider had\
  \ assured me, no connections with locals, and seven days until my return flight\
  \ to Jamaica. One of the most distinct memories I have in Habana, was standing outside\
  \ the airport that night. It must have been around 1130pm. The air was warm, perfectly\
  \ warm, almost inviting me to walk into the distance. I remember thinking to myself,\
  \ \u201Cmaybe if I just start walking I\u2019ll find something fantastic, something\
  \ authentic, I\u2019ll find Cuba. I recall standing there feeling the push and pull\
  \ of travel anxiety and freedom, and having the moment of realization that says,\
  \ \u201CHey, I am so glad I tried, because despite what happens in the next seven\
  \ days, I made it.\u201D\nThe rational thinker in me kicked in and I sought the\
  \ information desk thinking they may be willing to help, I thought, \u201CHey, you\
  \ could always try.\u201D It was there that a woman working, whom spoke perfect\
  \ English took care of me, whether out of concern or humor, which she outwardly\
  \ acknowledged both, to those around us. It was because of her hospitality and community\
  \ that those next seven days were the most memorable of all the places I shall go.\
  \ And to think, that had my will been nothing but trying, and all my luck present,\
  \ I may have yet made it to Cuba, but left waiting in Departures all the while."
