Text: "I was tired. It had been a long and hot day. What I wanted was somewhere quiet\
  \ to sit, have something to eat and relax. I walked into a dimly lit bar- or maybe\
  \ it just appeared that way because it was so bright outside. My eyes had difficulty\
  \ focusing in here. It appeared quiet from the outside, but I was mistaken. People\
  \ crowded at tables and stood shoulder to shoulder along the bar. There was the\
  \ dull and constant murmur of excited chatter.\n\nMy friend walked in behind me,\
  \ and the people nearest to the door encouraged us to come in and sit down in broken\
  \ English. We were in Split, Croatia at a local pub three blocks from where we were\
  \ staying. I gladly sat at a small table in the corner and surveyed my surroundings.\
  \ All the tables were faced toward a large TV hanging on one wall, and nearly everyone\
  \ was dressed in red and white checked outfits. I noticed some people had face paint\
  \ and flags. Ah, I thought to myself, its the World Cup semi final. This isn't going\
  \ to be the quiet night I had hoped for! I couldn't help but feel a little dismayed-\
  \ I just wanted to rest! It had been a big day.\n\nMy friend and I had spent the\
  \ day exploring the amazing city of Split; walking through the ruins and along the\
  \ coast just taking in the atmosphere, the people, the sounds. We took photos, navigated\
  \ the public transport (an adventure in itself), learned as much history as we could,\
  \ sampled the local foods, and attempted to engage with locals in broken verbal\
  \ languages and sign language. We were exhausted! \n\nAnd I don't usually follow\
  \ soccer, or become invested in sporting matches in general. But this time. I couldn't\
  \ help but be swept up in the moment- the atmosphere was electric with excitement,\
  \ and I couldn't help but catch it. We couldn't understand each other, the locals\
  \ and myself, but we knew we were cheering the same team, that we wanted the same\
  \ outcome.\n\nAs the clock ran down, and Croatia were up by one point, the excitement\
  \ grew. The energy in the small pub intensified. The cheers became louder. After\
  \ the final siren sounded, the cheer was like an explosion- emitting from a swarm\
  \ of jumping, flag waving, fans. Outside, the fireworks and road flares were exploding,\
  \ cars were honking and the people ran to the streets yelling their praise of their\
  \ team. It was exhilarating bedlam! This is not what we had anticipated after our\
  \ long day, but it was an amazing end. An experience we won't ever forget."
