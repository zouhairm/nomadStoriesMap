Text: "A menacing protrusion on a mountainous landscape. I had often contemplated\
  \ the \u2018Muela del Diablo\u2019 (the Devil\u2019s Tooth or Molar) from some of\
  \ my favourite spots in the wacky and wonderful city of Nuestra Se\xF1ora de La\
  \ Paz in Bolivia. \n\nI\u2019d heard a mixed bag of anecdotes and  legends about\
  \ the place. It\u2019s a sacred space for the Aymara people, Auqui Kollo or the\
  \ Father Summit; but it\u2019s also rumoured to be the site of satanic rituals and\
  \ \u2018other dark stuff\u2019 according to my suspicious Catholic pals. A quick\
  \ Google revealed a few creepy stories published in the local newspaper such as\
  \ \u2018Young girl makes deal with the devil at la Muela del Diablo and suffers\
  \ terrible accident\u2019. A shiver ran down my spine.\n\nMy friend Caroline and\
  \ I woke up early, packed our bags with avocadoes and bread, and set off. We met\
  \ our friend Sul at the statue of Eduardo Abaroa in the square that bears his name.\
  \ He was a famous Bolivian general who died defending Bolivia\u2019s access to the\
  \ sea. It seems oddly British to celebrate grit and perseverance over triumph, perhaps\
  \ another reason the Brits seem to fall into step in La Paz more easily than the\
  \ Yanks. We jumped into a tiny minibus that hurtled down vertiginous, snaking roads\
  \ and delivered us to the upmarket, Americanesque neighbourhood of San Miguel in\
  \ the southern part of the city. \n\nIn traditional Bolivian style, we waited over\
  \ an hour for another friend who was \u20185 minutes away\u2019, and had the odd\
  \ experience of sitting by the area\u2019s most populous church on Easter Saturday.\
  \ Well-dressed, sombre people of all ages ascended the stairs for a special Easter\
  \ service while we loitered and played around with stray dogs. Some were flocking\
  \ to pay tribute to their saviour, and others were waiting to climb up to a point\
  \ bearing the name of his nemesis. Perhaps we were in purgatory? I frowned at the\
  \ implications of this, but before my thoughts could fully form Shala bounced into\
  \ view with her tiny dog (bizarrely, also named Shala) and we hitched another minibus\
  \ to the foot of the mountain.\n\nWe began our ascent up a dusty path, the altitude\
  \ UV rays were as unforgiving as ever and the local dogs howled in warning. The\
  \ canine presence, the heat, and the dilapidated brick buildings around us painted\
  \ a modernised picture of the gates of hell. Sul\u2019s elven features slid smoothly\
  \ into a serene smile as he broke the dark spell by calling over one of his friends\
  \ that he\u2019d spotted up ahead, our pilgrimage party gained a member. The first\
  \ stop was a local caserita (the local way of referring to the women who run small\
  \ kiosks) to see if we could source some beers. During Semana Santa (Easter week),\
  \ there is a ban on selling and drinking alcohol for a couple of days in the major\
  \ cities of Bolivia, as a sign of respect to the Lord. However, the more rural communities\
  \ took a different view on the weekend of Christ\u2019s demise; while the Lord\u2019\
  s away\u2026\n\nThe road was long. We scrambled up bushy slopes, beat our way through\
  \ bracken and emerged in a field of flowers and lush grass courtesy of the recent\
  \ unexpected heavy rains. It was looking less like the road to hell and more like\
  \ a return to the primordial garden. As we approached the satanic tooth-formation\
  \ Sul bounded ahead like a mountain goat, bumping into more friends and recruiting\
  \ more pilgrimage partners, while Shala (human) and Shala (dog) took selfies for\
  \ Instagram amongst purple flowers. Caroline and I began to clamber and sweat our\
  \ way up the rocky finger that pointed to somewhere in between the sky and the city.\
  \ Spent, we sat on pride rock and surveyed the Andean kingdom below. We shared the\
  \ beers and stories as the sun played about our feet; for once, the Devil\u2019\
  s Tooth was illuminated. As the locals covered their heads with scarves, I knew\
  \ that tomorrow I was going to be gloriously red, but I did not regret our pagan\
  \ journey. My eyes thirstily drank in the horizon before closing and drifting into\
  \ devilish dreams."
