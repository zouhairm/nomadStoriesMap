Text: "If you could overlook the stripped back white paint, rusty hood, along with\
  \ the non-existent bumper and doors, I guess you could call it a Jeep. \n\n'Are\
  \ we really driving in that?' asked Jo quietly, as we all admired the car parked\
  \ outside the \"Beauty & Jewels\" antique shop. \n\n'Yes', we grinned. \n\nWe had\
  \ just finished our first year at Uni, and I was convinced by Jo during one of our\
  \ Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphics classes to spend a week in Jordan before we were\
  \ asked to arrive in Israel for our Archaeological Dig. I was initially pretty hesitant,\
  \ explaining to her that Jordan was no place for a Jew, let alone a Jewish woman.\
  \ \n\nJo screamed as we hit about 120km/h, our local guide Hamza slowing down slightly\
  \ at the sound of her yelp. You could feel the red rocks punching the bottom of\
  \ the Jeep, their uncertainty of strangers evident. \"I'm Coming Home\" by Sheppard\
  \ was our soundtrack as we entered the Wadi Rum. A red wilderness enveloped us,\
  \ basalt mountains and peaks rising amongst the red hills. We kept on driving for\
  \ a while, the red rocks still not used to us, but us, more acquainted with them.\
  \ As Hamza gave us a heads up that we were about to stop, all three of us mounted\
  \ the bottom rim of the Jeep, one hand gripping the top rim. We swung out, our hiking\
  \ shoes sinking an inch. I would be lying if I didn't mention that as soon as we\
  \ hopped out Jess and Jo roped ME AND THE GUIDE into taking a jump shot photo. I\
  \ can admit that it turned out to be a very awesome photo, especially with Hamza\
  \ in it. Hamza talked quite a bit about the history of the Wadi Rum, and the Nabateans\
  \ who survived in the harsh climate for thousands of years. At one point we came\
  \ upon a well, roughly about the size of an oven door, in the desert ground. Naturally,\
  \ I had to have my Indiana Jones moment and stick my head far into the opening to\
  \ see how far it went down and if there were any hidden treasures at the bottom\
  \ (sadly there weren't). \n\nHamza knowing I had an eagerness to explore and see\
  \ things beyond the regular tourist, lead us down a set of falling sandy step which\
  \ lead into a cave. The cave was hidden by a makeshift door out of smaller rocks\
  \ which the locals used to cover the entrance. Now, this was now real Indiana Jones\
  \ moment. Sketches marked the walls of the tubing tunnel, which welcomed us into\
  \ a 2x2 meter opening. These markings, made by the Nabatean's, carpeted every single\
  \ space on the walls of the room. Their presence was here with us. \n\nOur soundtrack\
  \ back to \"Beauty & Jewels\" was once again \"I'm Coming Home\" by Shepard. Every\
  \ time I hear that song it reminds me of being free, in a place they call Mars on\
  \ Earth."
