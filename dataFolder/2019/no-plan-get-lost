Text: "It was March 2017, I started my travel out of Asia couple with my collegue\
  \ our first travel eventhough we never hang out together because we are live in\
  \ different province but travel with her was the craziest.\n\nHer bos said that\
  \ we were crazy travel to Europe on that month because the weather was crazy in\
  \ that time, but our faith stronger than the craziest weather, I remember I said\
  \ to her 'Bismillah positive thinking' so we we decided to buy the ticket for next\
  \ 5 month trip.\n\nWhen we arrive and during our trip around Europe to 4 countries\
  \ only in Swiss was raining but for the next day the sun smile to us \U0001F601\U0001F601\
  .\n\nSwiss never ending amazed, a pieces of heaven fallen down to the earth. We\
  \ always make ourselves get lost in Swiss. We have same words for Swiss 'get lost\
  \ in Swiss you never dissapointed everywhere is heaven'.\n\n2nd day in Swiss we\
  \ plan to go to Grindlewald but we forgot our sport cam so we change the scenario.\
  \ I remember that i ever read that there is a villlage with hundreds water fall\
  \ the village named Lauterbrunen, so we go there by train and here we are, both\
  \ of us speechless, silent for moment watching a breathtaking scenery soooo quite\
  \ here, feel peace but we can't find a dry grass because we want to rolling on the\
  \ grass feel free but we couldn't find \U0001F601\U0001F601\U0001F601.\n\nAfter\
  \ we sit, jumping, sleep on the bench, play with a dog, screaming out of loud, taking\
  \ picture, laughing, going crazy we move to the next city with hard feeling leaving\
  \ Lauterbrunen. I didn't expect to find such a beatiful place like Lauterbrunen\n\
  \nWe went to Bern, praying time so we have to find a mosque near with train station\
  \ we used google map and we found a mosque also as Islamic center. They pleased\
  \ us and show the room for woman and we prepare for praying, and then someone knocking\
  \ the door then I open, surprise they give us in a big plate of pop corn and bread\
  \ thanks God \U0001F601\U0001F601\U0001F601 we never expect too much than this we\
  \ can pray in a proper place is enough for us but they give us snacks.\n\nDuring\
  \ trip to Europe the Sun always smile to us so we can show off to my friend's boss\
  \ even when we visited Germany her bos home country, her bos said the wheather will\
  \ be rain and so cold but he fact the sun shining too bright. But we get freezing\
  \ and windy in Amsterdam.\n\nTravel to Europe with crazy partner was the best travel\
  \ ever we do also couch surfing so we can get mingle with locals it was when we\
  \ were at Interlaken Swiss.\n\nI hope one day I have one or two months full traveling\
  \ and get more stories and more experiences for my kids to tell"
