Text: "2016, quit my job in Sydney, embarked on a 3 month solo travel adventure, Brazil\
  \ (bucket list item!, USA, Canada, followed by Europe, and the rest is history\u2026\
  \nAgainst many of my friends and families will at the time, solo female travelling\
  \ to Brazil, it made the 42 hour journey quite wonderous for me (yes that's right,\
  \ I didn't realise I booked the long route to get there!), finally arrived in Sao\
  \ Paulo, to some of my Brazilian friends (who I had connected with 4 years ago during\
  \ a Contiki trip, and made a promise back then, I'll come and visit them!), amazing\
  \ experience, they took me to the finals of the SAF Championships, partying, celebrating,\
  \ connecting with the locals, I loved it, and thought I loved Brazil already...until\
  \ my next stop, Rio De Janeiro, oh what do I even say about this place, best place\
  \ I have ever visited, hands down my favourite city, filled with some of my most\
  \ memorable experiences to date! Stayed in a hostel in the middle of Lapa, the hostel\
  \ staff were incredibly friendly, invited me to come out drinking with them after\
  \ their shifts, off to a great start. Signed up to a day tour run by the hostel,\
  \ which I couldn't recommend more for anyone to do, met some friends for life there\
  \ (again), we walked the Favellas together, climbed to top of the Christ the Redeemer\
  \ Statue, and topped it off with an unforgettable trek to the top of the Sugarloaf\
  \ mountain, with some of the best views I have witnessed to date! Being solo, we\
  \ then decided to meet up at their hostel the next day, hang out at Copacabana beach,\
  \ then they were heading my way the next night for a night out in Lapa - we didn't\
  \ really have phones on us, so it was all just reliant on trust and communication,\
  \ it worked though, met them at my hostel and walked into the first bar we found,\
  \ playing some awesome beats, and really got a taste of the locals too! Whilst dancing,\
  \ some guy came and started chatting, though I couldn't really hear him so we went\
  \ outside...minutes later, midst conversation, he was throwing up on the sideway,\
  \ I didn't know what to do, but luckily this lovely couple near by recognised my\
  \ situation, and came to help, through conversation, and being the small world this\
  \ is, they actually live back in Australia too, just 10 mins down the road from\
  \ me! Anyway, we fed this guy water, and tried to get him back up, and take him\
  \ maybe to my hostel since that was closest, but they refused to let him in, even\
  \ though they knew me (fair call!), after numerous attempts, we found something\
  \ in his pockets identifying where he's staying, we all got in a cab and dropped\
  \ him off, and came back to party on together..Next day, I was checking out, flew\
  \ to New Orleans, and had an email from my hostel asking how I am and random questions,\
  \ I thought I'd reply later, though don't think I ever got round to it, went about\
  \ my travels..USA, Canada, Europe, and London wasn't on my agenda, though I had\
  \ friends living there at the time who made me book last minute to come visit, and\
  \ so I did...next day after landing, get this call on my phone, it was the guy I\
  \ met in Brazil who spewed midst conversation on me, apparently we exchanged numbers,\
  \ that email from the hostel was him trying to contact me to verify my number is\
  \ correct via email, as he came there looking for me but I had checked out already,\
  \ and so we caught up for drinks, he showed me around London, parts of London I\
  \ never even knew existed, I did not expect to find any of this in London, nor did\
  \ I expect to find him, find me! In summary, my trip was over, flew back to Sydney,\
  \ but knew I had to follow my heart and passion, so 1 year later, moved to London,\
  \ re-connected with some of my amazing travel friends from all my journeys, and\
  \ absolutely loving the travel life!"
