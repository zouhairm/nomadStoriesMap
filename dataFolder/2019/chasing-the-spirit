Text: "On the very last day of 2018 I am taking my close friend \u2013 Swiss citizen\
  \ with a passion for exotic travels \u2013 to the mysterious land of my ancestors\
  \ where I have not lived for quite a while. \n\nAs agreed, we meet on a bone-chilling\
  \ early morning at the airport in the middle of nowhere. We are welcomed by my family,\
  \ but also by thick darkness, -33 \xB0C, breath misting, icy snow under our feet\
  \ and nervous excitement evoked by the inclement environment. Hello, Siberia. \n\
  \nHis ideal trip would be hiking in the wildest forest at \u201342 \xB0C or going\
  \ ice-fishing on a lake in the middle of endless steppes; and his expectations are\
  \ not unrealistic. My ideal trip would be reconnecting with the place that excites\
  \ the imagination of many people and that once was my crib. I truly want to show\
  \ the \u201Creal Siberia\u201D to my friend; but I also hope that the two of us\
  \ would be lucky enough to feel the Siberian spirit, whatever it is. How realistic\
  \ my expectations are?  \n\nThe main destination point is Sayanogorsk  - a small\
  \ town in Khakassia, ancient land of Turkic nomads of Eastern Siberia. During six-hour\
  \ riding through the rugged prairies slightly covered in snow \u2013 who would have\
  \ thought these Mars-resembling landscapes would be not less Siberian then impenetrable\
  \ forests of taiga? - my friend is napping, while I can\u2019t stop looking out\
  \ of the window. \u201CLook! This is a true nomad spirit, in the wind above all\
  \ this wilderness!\u201D I want to say. \u201CAre you hungry?\u201D I say instead.\
  \ We are not looking in the same direction, and emotions are hard to translate.\
  \  \n\n Sayanogorsk, my hometown, is lucky \u2013 built on the bank of the busy\
  \ Yenisei river, it is lovingly cuddled by wooded mountains on one side. Finding\
  \ a cozy camp in the nature with a decent Russian sauna (\u201Cbanya\u201D we call\
  \ it) shortly after our arrival feels perfectly right.  \u201CHave these old, snow-bound\
  \ pines ever heard people speaking English?\u201D I wonder. He says nothing, sipping\
  \ black coffee from the thermos bottle and looking at the river which we can hardly\
  \ see through the heavy fog. It is overwhelmingly quiet; we hear the water and the\
  \ frost in the air. He can\u2019t remember the name \u201CYenisei\u201D and asks\
  \ couple of questions about \u201Cthat River\u201D. The landscape fascinates us;\
  \ and we both start thinking our own thoughts.  \n\nFour hours later, in the dark,\
  \ two steamy bodies rush down the wooden stairs connecting the sauna with the busy\
  \ ice-cold river. Our dead cold feet hurt unbearably, as we get up the nerve to\
  \ jump into the freezing waters. It feels like we are born again. On the way back\
  \ I see his body enwrapped in a huge cloud of white steam, just like mine.   \n\n\
  That cold Siberian night saw us being the closest to the nature and to each other\
  \ we had ever been.  Could this be the spirit?"
