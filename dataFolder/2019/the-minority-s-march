Text: "I rubbed my eyes to the sound of three intrusive knocks on my door at 1.50\
  \ AM. I was about to rant out of annoyance when I heard a voice reminding me that\
  \ a long sleep should not be my biggest interest that dawn. \u201CIt\u2019s time!\u201D\
  \ called Dami in Bahasa, the host of Homestay Cantik, with a very distinguishable\
  \ East Indonesian accent. A middle-aged woman local to the city of Kalabahi, Alor\
  \ regency, her dark brown skin stood out as I opened the creaking door, even under\
  \ minimal light reflected from my bedroom lamp. \u201CYou better get ready! The\
  \ torch parade will start in 10 minutes,\u201D she said with her eyes bright with\
  \ excitement, knowing it would be my first time to be a part of the annual local\
  \ tradition. I could not say I felt the same way. \n\nOnly two months had passed\
  \ after the sword attack by a radical Islamist at a church mass in Sleman, East\
  \ Java. Yet there I was in the neighboring island, still in the same biggest Muslim\
  \ majority country in the world, getting ready to join a torch parade in celebration\
  \ of Easter. Although Alor and the entire East Nusa Tenggara might have the highest\
  \ percentage of Christians in the country, it did not do my paranoia any good. \n\
  \nOut of curiosity, I followed Dami and her husband by foot, heading to the nearest\
  \ church in blinding darkness. The closer we got, the clearer the chatters we heard.\
  \ Hundreds of locals gathered in front of the church building, some still in pajamas,\
  \ each carrying a torch lit with fire. The heat crippled into my bones as I sneaked\
  \ into the crowd, unknowingly separated from Dami and her husband. I panicked. Not\
  \ long after, a worn-out pickup truck drove in with two huge-sized speakers on its\
  \ back. As soon as music was played, the crowd cheerfully sang along to religious\
  \ praise songs, serenading themselves as the march began. It was too late for me\
  \ to find Dami. Alone, I tried my best to blend in. \n\nAs we circled around the\
  \ city, I felt mosquitos biting my uncovered arms and face. Yet frankly, it was\
  \ not what disturbed me the most. I, also a Christian, was deeply concerned about\
  \ my own safety. I wondered, how could all these people be so worry-free? If a church\
  \ mass in an appropriate building and time was risky enough, what would the chances\
  \ be for a parade like this? Out in the open, at dawn. Looking around, it was irrefutable\
  \ that the collective vibrant light from our torches would pierce through even curtained\
  \ windows, let alone our loud chants that would undoubtedly wake anyone whose house\
  \ we passed through. \n\nOnce in a while, the march would stop. The chants were\
  \ replaced by a bold voice sounded through a horn speaker, by a man who had the\
  \ charisma of a leader. The pastor, I would assume. At each stop, he read one passage\
  \ from the Bible, narrating it to seem like we were reliving the day of Jesus\u2019\
  \ resurrection\u2014each story responded with claps and shouts of victory, as if\
  \ we all had just won something. Not me.\n\nEvery step I took felt heavy, burdened\
  \ by anxiety more than it was pulled by gravity. Some home owners came out as we\
  \ passed, but only to join the parade. Assuming they were Christians too, there\
  \ still was no sign of people of other religions. Could they still be asleep or\u2026\
  ? The worst scenario was too scary to imagine. If an attack was to be done to a\
  \ religious minority group, we were pretty much the ideal target.\n\nAn hour into\
  \ the parade, my eyes caught women wearing hijabs by the road. I was on guard, until\
  \ I realized what they were up to. Contrary to my fear, they waved at the crowd\
  \ with warmth and wished us a happy Easter. The parade carried on until 4 AM, ending\
  \ with an outdoor church mass, in peace. It got me so ashamed of myself for being\
  \ stereotypical, but at the same time relieved that there still exist people living\
  \ up to the national motto of Indonesia: Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\u2014different, but\
  \ one. Unity in diversity."
