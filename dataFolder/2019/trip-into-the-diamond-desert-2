Text: "On Namibia's southern coast lies the often overlooked but picturesque harbour\
  \ town of L\xFCderitz, surrounded by sweeping dunes on one side and a roaring ocean\
  \ on the other.\n\nWindswept but welcoming, it now appears set to be a stop for\
  \ more people with the opening of the Tsau //Khaeb (Sperrgebiet) National Park,\
  \ which is being co-funded by the governments of Namibia and Germany.\n\nThe Sperrgebiet\
  \ area was once closed off to the public for mining purposes, but the tourism ministry\
  \ was granted permission to set up a controlled tourist park.\n\nThe park embraces\
  \ the ghost town of Kolmanskop and impressive historic and natural attractions,\
  \ including a towering rock arch, the Bogenfels Rock.\n\nFrom the airport, we drove\
  \ to Kolmanskop, a deserted mining town some 10 kilometres inland from L\xFCderitz.\n\
  \nIt was like being in a time warp. Sand envelops dilapidated houses built in the\
  \ German architectural style of the early 20th century. We were greeted by our enthusiastic\
  \ tour guide William, who gave us a history lesson about the area.\n\nMoving from\
  \ building to building, you could see brick structures withered from age, but still\
  \ holding strong: a theatre, butchery, bakery, ice factory and hospital, among others.\n\
  \nThere were warning signs at the entrance of some buildings because some sections\
  \ were unsafe. A few guests cautioned me every time I wanted to take a peek at places\
  \ as I walked around with my camera strapped around my neck and my phone firmly\
  \ placed in my back pocket.\n\nIn one of the more stable rooms, William showed us\
  \ how, back in the day, residents placed ice blocks on their fridges, which looked\
  \ more like ordinary cupboards. Any excess water was used to water plants.\n\nOne\
  \ house especially caught my eye because it had such an authentic German feel, ein\
  \ kleines Deutschland. It was a tiny, two-bedroom house with wooden floors and brown\
  \ furniture. \n\nThe next day, we embarked on a nearly nine-hour drive through the\
  \ national park to overnight at Oranjemund, around 300 kilometres away. Before entering\
  \ the once-restricted diamond area, we were greeted by staff from Namdeb, who conducted\
  \ breathalyser tests on the drivers before allowing them to drive in.\n\nOur tour\
  \ guide, Mendes Vinte, said the test was vital to ensure that no one was intoxicated\
  \ in case of an accident.\n\nAs we headed out to the park again the next day, we\
  \ fed off each other's energy in the car. There was laughter, interspersed with\
  \ history lessons.\n\nVinte would point out areas William had previously referred\
  \ to, and explain how the mining process was done.\n\nWe visited a small settlement\
  \ away from the mining sites where the residents stayed then. There, they had stone-structured\
  \ houses and a cemetery, some distance away, overlooking the desert. Even with the\
  \ tombstones, the divide between poor and rich was visible.\n\nThen, it was on to\
  \ the breathtaking Bogenfels Rock, a 55-metre high rock arch that is a landmark\
  \ on the Atlantic Coast.\n\nAs we got out of our cars, everyone was in awe of its\
  \ rugged beauty, even those who have been there before.\n\nMy fear of heights did\
  \ not stop me from climbing up the Bogenfels rock because I knew it was where you\
  \ could get the best view of the entire area. My clumsiness got the best of me when\
  \ I tripped on some rocks, and my phone fell multiple times. Fortunately, the screen\
  \ did not crack.\n\nOnce at the top, we were greeted by the Atlantic Ocean stretching\
  \ out in front of us, a perfect shade of blue with waves bashing against the rocks\
  \ at a rapid rate.\n\nAfter our adventure up the rock, we had a quick lunch before\
  \ returning to Oranjemund. The drive was quiet this time around. We were lost in\
  \ our thoughts, and tired from all the excitement. Before leaving the park, the\
  \ routine breathalyser test for the drivers was done.\n\nOur last night at Oranjemund\
  \ was spent at the golf club, where we had dinner, played a game of darts, shared\
  \ more laughter and revelled in the beauty of our country.\n\nThe long drive was\
  \ filled with self-reflection, smiles and sneaking behind cars to relieve ourselves\
  \ because there are no toilets in the desert."
