Text: "You know, it happened not so long ago. I was young and ambitious, left for\
  \ Norway to conquer myself.\nIn Norway, of course, it was beautiful, but it was\
  \ also terribly expensive. The sun, with its rays, very persistently was shining\
  \ in the eyes, very nice people were walking around.\nCertainly, we with my friend\
  \ (we decided on this journey together) liked everything very much, especially the\
  \ gray sky upon arrival in this beautiful country. At first it was cold and wet,\
  \ we were a little tired, but were full of energy. Do not forget, we came to conquer\
  \ ourselves.\nWe took a big bus, it seems, if my memory serves me (I am not young\
  \ anymore), the bus was gray. On it, we went to the side of the capital of Norway.\
  \ And the capital of Norway, if you do not know (everything happens in life) - is\
  \ Oslo.\nBut it seems that I did not tell you that the flight from Warsaw to Norway\
  \ was the first flight in my life. I was sitting by the window, with the sinking\
  \ of my kind heart looking down at the fields, rivers, the Baltic Sea and its small\
  \ ships.\nIt should be noted that my lfriend kindly gave me a place at the window.\
  \ She is a woman who has seen many countries.\nI liked the flight, we met a Polish\
  \ man who tried to speak with us in Russian, but he did not quite succeed and he\
  \ fell asleep. Probably tired.\nSo, the bus was gray and we drove past the rocks\
  \ for about an hour. And once - through a tunnel in the rock! It was amazing! First,\
  \ I had not seen a rock before, only mountains. Secondly, it was already dark and\
  \ in the twilight to be in a dark tunnel \u2013is a magic. Thirdly, on these rocks\
  \ were small houses which had been decorated with lanterns, and it looked as cute\
  \ as possible, as from a postcard. It seems, or I then shed tears? Yes, I am a very\
  \ impressionable woman.\nThere was a lot of water in Oslo and beautiful buildings.\
  \ People were happy and ate ice cream, and we lived in a hostel. We got acquainted\
  \ with two Italians who promised to cook pizza for us, but for some reason they\
  \ fell asleep. There was no pizza. But there was a girl from the States with us\
  \ in the room, she knew very little about the peoples of Russia and I enlightened\
  \ her. Together with the Italians we sang songs, forgiving them for the fact that\
  \ there was no pizza.\nMy friend and I walked a lot, ate food that we brought from\
  \ Warsaw. We were starved, but we liked that kind city.\nOf course, the culmination\
  \ of this small trip (two days) was a very pleasant acquaintance. I was so inspired\
  \ that even the next months I looked at the photo and smiled. There are few such\
  \ acquaintances in the world; you can count them on your fingers.\nIt happened like\
  \ this: my friend and I sat down on a bench to study the map. She (my friend is\
  \ a woman) was wearing binoculars in her hand, and a commander\u2019s cap on her\
  \ head (joke). We sat, looked at the map, gurgled an empty stomach, the sun was\
  \ shining, and THAT happened.\nIt was a cute little duck. He (the duck was a man)\
  \ came to us as close as possible and began to look at my friend's white sneakers.\
  \ Perhaps the duck wanted himself the same. Perhaps the duck, on the contrary, prefers\
  \ sandals. Having said nothing, the duck leisurely withdrew. I managed to take some\
  \ pictures and I am happy remembering our meeting somewhere in Scandinavia."
