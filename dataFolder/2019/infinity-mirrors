Text: "On September 6, 2018, I went to the Cleveland Museum of Art to see the Yayoi\
  \ Kusama Infinity Mirror exhibit. I had no idea what to expect. The $30 ticket was\
  \ tough to purchase and the lines to get into the different rooms was long. I had\
  \ missed an opportunity in DC a year ago. I needed a change in my consistently dull\
  \ routine of working and managing home lifestyle. I saw the reviews and knew there\
  \ would be a lot of color and mirrors. But, I did not expect this exhibit to make\
  \ a connection with my life. The perspective of my life changed by my reflection,\
  \ formation, and confusion. \nDuring the exhibit were six infinity mirror rooms\
  \ that you can step in for 5 minutes to experience the place. A staff member was\
  \ at every door with a timer. They would open the door to let you in the start the\
  \ time and close the door. Each room had a different theme that engulfed you in\
  \ each detail. One particular room had a small set of colorful lights that seem\
  \ like stars and looking in the mirror at a certain angle. It looked as if I was\
  \ one with the universe. Insignificant me was part of a whole creation that could\
  \ be viewed by only me. At that moment, I felt that I was part of a higher purpose\
  \ even though my objective was not yet defined. At that moment, I knew what it might\
  \ feel like to be an astronaut in space, and it was time to find my purpose. \n\
  The exhibit had a series of oil paintings on canvas. One particular painting, called\
  \ No I.Q., had a set of brown dots on a dark background. At a distance, it looked\
  \ like a leather hide of an animal. Observing the painting closer, you can see brown\
  \ dots surrounded by lighter outer circles. The painting had me thinking about my\
  \ creation. Not every cell that forms the different organs in the body are the same,\
  \ but, they are details in the formation. In the painting, each dot and circle had\
  \ a purpose. The time it took to add the features made the picture extraordinary.\
  \ Just like every detail big or small in my life make me, Natalie. \nThe last exhibit\
  \ called The Obliteration Room, they gave you five dots different in color and sizes.\
  \ We were told to participate in art. The room started with everything white even\
  \ the furniture and after a week of people walking through with dots. The room looked\
  \ like it a bomb of colorful dots went off and became a ball confusion. Identifying\
  \ different items was difficult. You had to get close to see any details because\
  \ dots went on for infinity. I placed my dots on things that I enjoyed most in the\
  \ room: a globe, a book, a guitar, a light fixture, and a table. During all that\
  \ confusion, I found peace with the details. I took pictures of everything I could.\
  \ But, I notice that in my selfies my eyes were crossed. This room didn\u2019t have\
  \ a time frame, but I was happy to leave. \nBy the end of the exhibit, I felt more\
  \ peace. I watched other people leave with childish smiles and laughter. I wish\
  \ I could retake the journey, but, I know it would not be the same. It was not enough\
  \ time to experience this change. I think that was Yayoi Kusama point to the time\
  \ restriction, to live in the moment.  I\u2019m glad I took the journey. I believe\
  \ that one life is the greatest poems not written but lived. As a poet, I look for\
  \ details in reflection, formation, and confusion. This exhibit sent my mind in\
  \ a much needed sensory journey.  If you are here breathing, you are created with\
  \ a purpose. The hard part we will never know our importance, that left to be discovered\
  \ by others. This experience reminded me to write. Anne Frank never understood the\
  \ significance of her diary. I would never know the importance of my poetry. I took\
  \ a lot of pictures, but, this exhibit should be experienced in person. A photograph\
  \ did the show no justice."
