Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find wallabies on the Isle of Man, but there they were,\
  \ hopping about. Other things I didn\u2019t expect to find were faeries. \nAs we\
  \ drove over an old stony bridge, my friend, guide and island native, Siobhan shouted\
  \ \u201CSay hello to the faeries!\u201D \n\u201CYou what?!\u201D I said.\n\u201C\
  The faeries. You\u2019ve got to say hello to them or it\u2019s bad luck.\u201D I\
  \ laughed it off. \u201C\u2026no\u2026really\u201D she said, completely deadpan.\
  \ \u201CThere are faeries under that bridge. If you don\u2019t say hello to them,\
  \ they\u2019ll make me crash the car or something. You have to do it.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Hello faeries,\u201D I told them, wondering about her sanity. And just like that\
  \ we survived the drive. \n\nThere\u2019s much more to the Isle of Man than just\
  \ that-motorbike-race-you-know-the-really-dangerous-one (The TT). It\u2019s actually\
  \ really worth going in the summertime before or after the race when there are not\
  \ so many drunk people around. Don\u2019t get me wrong there will still be drunk\
  \ people on the Isle of Man, but they\u2019ll be locals so it\u2019s part of the\
  \ experience. The air is fresh, the sea is clear and there are seals. Like. Everywhere.\
  \ The views are stunning from anywhere on the island, with rolling green hills,\
  \ it\u2019s basically like a mini New Zealand.  \n\nOur first stop was Craegneash,\
  \ a historic village on the south west part of the island, full of beautiful 19th\
  \ century thatched cottages and workshops which are still used today. It\u2019s\
  \ both a museum and a real village, and you could rent a cottage there for about\
  \ \xA3700pcm if you wanted a rustic, secluded bolt-hole for a summer of walking\
  \ and reading.\n\nWe then hopped on down the road to see the seals up close, bobbing\
  \ around in the shallows between the mainland and The Calf of Man, which is a.50-square-kilometre\
  \ island that has only one inhabitant: an estate warden, who has one of the most\
  \ isolated jobs in Britain and monitors the wildlife. \n\u201CScrew working in the\
  \ city,\u201D I said to Siobhan. \u201CI want to live here and get paid to watch\
  \ seals all day. Sign me up!\u201D I haven\u2019t\u2019 actually signed up to be\
  \ the warden, but if you want to, you can apply for the job every January.\n\nAfter\
  \ our long day of walking drove over to Port Erin for a G&T, which was rhubarb flavoured,\
  \ and made from local produce, by the way. We sat back, and relaxed as we watched\
  \ the fishing boats bob up and down on by the jetty (you get the picture, it was\
  \ idyllic). \n\nBut the G&T was just the warm up for the main event: The Outback.\
  \ Siobhan introduced this place to me as \u201CNot really a club. Kind of a bar\
  \ with a DJ, but a bit rowdier. It\u2019ll probably be the best and worst club you\u2019\
  ve ever been to at the same time.\u201D And boy was she wrong. It was whole heartedly\
  \ the best club I\u2019ve been to in the entire world. Where else can you watch\
  \ sports on the TV while dancing to a remix of The Vengaboys and downing a Squashed\
  \ Frog? Also, there\u2019s a balcony/gallery level where creepy people can just\
  \ stand and watch you! Honestly, it\u2019s a weird place and pretty sticky, but\
  \ we had such a great night, and got a fantastic fish & chips on the walk home at\
  \ 3am. \n\nAs Siobhan drove me to the airport in the morning, we went back over\
  \ the old, stony bridge.\n\u201CGoodbye faeries!\u201D I called out. \u201CSee you\
  \ next time!\u201D\n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D she said, utterly bemused. \u201C\
  You don\u2019t have to say goodbye to them you weirdo.\u201D"
