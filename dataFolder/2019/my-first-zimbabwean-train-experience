Text: "I have always heard weird and interesting stories about the Zimbabwean railway\
  \ service. I\ndecided to get on one on the 27th of September 2018.It was of the\
  \ most memorable \njourneys I have ever had, ever since I was born. I like to think\
  \ of myself as a local tourist, \nhaving explored some of the most fascinating places\
  \ in Zimbabwe, for this journey I decided\nto embark on a unique and completely\
  \ different mode of transport which was the train. I\nsay unique because the train\
  \ service is very popular for being inconvenient in my country, \nthis is due to\
  \ many reasons.\nI knew this journey was going to be very distinct well in advance.\
  \ The day before I took off, I\narrived at the deserted train station with hopes\
  \ of booking my ticket in advance. To my \nsurprise making a reservation was longer\
  \ a norm with the National Rail Ways of Zimbabwe. I\nwas told that I could only\
  \ buy a ticket on the day of my departure. I went home \ndisappointed, I thought\
  \ about abandoning the journey but then again, I have never given up \non any adventure.\
  \ The next day I showed up at the train station at exactly 6:30pm two \nhours before\
  \ the train departure. The mood of the train station was totally different. The\n\
  station was a hive of activity. From vendors to young kids playing close to the\
  \ train platform \nI was blown away by the busy composition. I quickly took out\
  \ my camera and started \nshooting the scene. I then heard a loud shout from my\
  \ back,\u201DHey sir stop it, stop it\u201D he \nshouted I looked back and it was\
  \ the Train station security looking directly at me. He\napproached me and told\
  \ me that cameras were not allowed in the train station. I quickly put \nmy camera\
  \ back in my back packed and apologized to the security and went straight to the\
  \ \ntrain ticket booking area. \nWhen I had bought my train ticket. I immediately\
  \ got onto the train which was already on \nthe platform. I started searching for\
  \ the perfect seat with the perfect view. I was too excited \nabout this journey\
  \ mainly because I was going to document it using my new entry level\ncannon video\
  \ camera, with that in mind I knew I had to look for a good seating area which \n\
  would give me access to a large window. I found a comfortable spot right close to\
  \ one of the \ntrain doors. After a few minutes of searching for the spot I quickly\
  \ realized that the economy \nand standard parts of the train were similar. The\
  \ Zimbabwe train service was surly in a \ndilapidated state. Some of the seats on\
  \ the train were rusty and filled with dirty food stains \nfrom rural travellers\
  \ who frequented the train service because of its inexpensive nature. I\nhad already\
  \ noticed a rat hunting for some left over\u2019s under the seats. The African\n\
  mosquitoes had already started singing around the young adventurous African tourist\
  \ like \nthey knew I was going to be their feast.\nThe train departed at approximately\
  \ 8: 45pm which was 45mins later. I knew I was in for a \ntreat. Seated in front\
  \ of me were 2 love birds that looked like local traders, they looked very \nfamiliar\
  \ with the train; I later discovered they actually were, they sold snacks to the\
  \ train \ntravellers. On my left was a young man who wore an Islam gown. Behind\
  \ me were two teen \nboys who seemed like they had ran away from home. The train\
  \ slowly left the city and as we moved away from the city I was capturing the panoramic\
  \ city lights on my video camera. \nThose next to me including the ones I have mentioned\
  \ were looking at me and marvelled at \nmy focus at the device. After a few minutes\
  \ I sat down and the young boy wearing the Islam\ngown looked at me smiled and I\
  \ smiled back, I moved close to his seat and introduced \nmyself and he greeted\
  \ back and said \u201CMy name is Ali\u201D. As the train moved further way from\
  \ \nthe city lights our faces faded into black."
