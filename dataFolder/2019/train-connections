Text: "I found myself at midnight at the train station in Hamm, Germany. If I had\
  \ been 30 seconds earlier, I would have caught my train. It said it was 5 minutes\
  \ late but that last train of the night to Berlin left on time. I had only arrived\
  \ in Berlin that morning and had a day trip planned out. That plan failed in a snap\
  \ of a second when the doors closed in front of me. I had a rush of panic, the early\
  \ fall winds did not affect me in my summer garments anymore. My phone was practically\
  \ useless without service and battery. The train station was partially shut down,\
  \ people were gone, even the restrooms were closed. I was alone with no money in\
  \ a strange place.\n\nI sat on the only bench on one of the isolated tracks, a traveling\
  \ middle-aged woman with puffy blonde hair sat on the other side of the bench. She\
  \ was wearing a blue flower pattern shirt, and short wedge sandals. I asked her,\
  \ \u201CDo you speak English?\u201D she hesitated, tilted her head from side to\
  \ side and said \u201CYes.\u201D I explained to her that I had a ticket to go to\
  \ Berlin, but I lost the train. She stood up rapidly and started to see all the\
  \ schedules on the board that look like binary codes to me. I could feel her frustration\
  \ trying to communicate with me, but she simply said: \u201CCome, we are going in\
  \ the same direction, but you need to get to Hannover.\u201D \n\nWe arrived in Bielefeld\
  \ at 3 am, and I could feel the tension in the air. The station was dirty and loud,\
  \ young people in their early 20s that were partying. People who have been drinking,\
  \ some drama between people here and there. For them, it was almost the end of the\
  \ night, but for us, we were barely halfway through. Trapped in this environment,\
  \ the woman looked at her watch and made a gesture of annoyance because we had to\
  \ wait two more hours there. In our boredom, we decided to go and walk around the\
  \ station downstairs. The blasting music could be heard in the echoing tunnel of\
  \ the station from the party across the street. \nAs we walked, four guys walk towards\
  \ the direction we were coming from, and all of a sudden one of them started running\
  \ and grabbed the woman\u2019s carry-on. My instant reaction was that she was being\
  \ robbed, no guns like back home in Venezuela but still getting the job done. However,\
  \ he was a drunk bully trying to be funny. This is how I, a 5\u20194\u201D tall\
  \ woman, ended up running somewhere in Germany behind a 6\u2019 tall male, in the\
  \ means of recovering a suitcase for a lady I just met. When running, the guy took\
  \ a sudden turn, and the lady crashed against an outdoor umbrella, I was slightly\
  \ more agile and managed to follow him. Another guy that was in the direction we\
  \ were all running to intercepted him and recovered the suitcase. \n\nWe fled the\
  \ scene, and we went to wait for the train upstairs by the tracks. The woman told\
  \ me she had two daughters around my age and that I reminded her of them. I could\
  \ feel her maternal protection towards me. A group of five men walked around our\
  \ bench, and she extended her arm to keep my stuff and hers safe. She explained\
  \ my situation to the train conductors in German so I could use my ticket without\
  \ penalties. She even told me to rest that she would wake me up when my station\
  \ approaches. \n\nIt was time to say goodbye, I had to get off, and she had to continue\
  \ a few more stations to get to her final destination. I told her thank you in all\
  \ the ways I could show my appreciation, and she smiled. The language was a little\
  \ barrier at the end of the night because it was a basic yet precious human connection.\
  \ I got off on Hanover to continue to Berlin and waved at her my final goodbye,\
  \ we shared smiles, and she went off her journey and I did mine."
