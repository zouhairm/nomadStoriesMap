Text: "Bratislava isn't exactly a foray into the unknown expanses of the world. Since\
  \ the end of the Cold War, it has opened itself up much like its contemporaries,\
  \ with the obvious parallels being drawn between itself and Prague. What can be\
  \ found is a dynamic city that seems to be playing with fire; a city that yearns\
  \ for the touristic pull of its more experienced older brother, but without the\
  \ \"stag do\" culture or seedy undertones. The actual city centre, rather small\
  \ and classically European, is much like many others; the snaking medieval streets,\
  \ filled with apparently \"authentic\" (a dubious claim) Slovak shops. The predominance\
  \ of English and German in much of the town centre shows the effect that tourism\
  \ has thrusted upon the city, and whilst it is indeed charming, it very much feels\
  \ like you are witnessing a show that has been put on especially for you, and you\
  \ begin to wonder, \"If I wasn't here, is this really how it would be?\" \n\nYet\
  \ thanks to some bad footwear and terrible weather., this is a question I won't\
  \ have to ask myself again In a decision to save money, We had booked a hotel a\
  \ fair distance from the city centre, on the outskirts of town. When visiting Bratislava's\
  \ castle that looms overt the west side of the city, a rogue rock punctured the\
  \ sole of one of my shoes. I thought nothing of it at the time, but of course despite\
  \ the stifling heat and dryness experienced so far, about an hour after this mishap\
  \ came a torrential downpour, leaving me soaked, and my footwear broken beyond the\
  \ point of saviour \nThe next day, the rest of my friends again set off to the city\
  \ centre, and I promised to catch them up later, after I had gone to the local shopping\
  \ centre to buy some new shoes. Walking around the industrial section of the town,\
  \ I quickly noticed the absence of English. Everything was in Slovak; the posters,\
  \ the menus of the cafes I passed, the advertisements in the shops.\nThe usual interaction\
  \ in a city like Bratislava is as follows; you use a translator app and in a very\
  \ poor accent mumble what is on your screen until the native person understands\
  \ what you want. They smile, and reply in English, congratulating you on your pronunciation,\
  \  more than happy to get a chance to practice their own skills, as after all many\
  \ tourists won't even bother to speak the language of the country they are visiting.\
  \ But here, in the outskirts of the city it was completely different. I stumbled\
  \ through asking for shoes and socks, only to be treated with  barrage of Slovak\
  \ in return. I was taken aback, but I liked it. No one in the shop spoke enough\
  \ English to be able to respond to me, meaning I had to continue with Slovak. On\
  \ my walk back, I took a longer route to further explore the industrial quarters,\
  \ parts of the city which haven't been spruced up for the tourists, as they are\
  \ not near the city centre and very few people, except from residents and workers,\
  \ pass through. It felt like a continuation of my experience whilst shopping; this\
  \ was the real Bratislava, not masquerading itself for the visitors, but existing\
  \ as it needs to exist. Colourful graffiti splattered the walls, and indeed the\
  \ graffiti was the only thing that seemingly wasn't grey in that part of town; even\
  \ the houses had no colour. Yet this was the real Bratislava in all of its glory,\
  \ the real soul of the city. \n\nI didn't meet up with my friends until the night-time.\
  \ I walked around the edges of the city on my own, experiencing if even for a while\
  \ the city behind the curtains. I stopped at a restaurant and ordered some food,\
  \ having to stumble through the conversation entirely in Slovakian, yet it brought\
  \ a radiant smile to myself and the waiters face. The mundane is not boring, it\
  \ is authentic, and ever since Bratislava is has been the mundane that I have sought\
  \ wherever I have visited."
