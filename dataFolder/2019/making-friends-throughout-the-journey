Text: "What do you have to say about traveling alone ? When you sit next to a stranger\
  \ in the bus and you catch the vibe that you could start a conversation about something\
  \ quite simple , like do you a have charger ? Well is very amusing to connect with\
  \ people who is in the same path as you. For me it happen when I was traveling near\
  \ Christmas from Amsterdam to Paris , and I had the fortune to sit next a girl with\
  \ deep blue eyes who happen to have mix blood as me, she was born in France with\
  \ parents from Spain , being said that for me was quite easy to entable a warm conversation\
  \ in Spanish , because I'm half Mexican and half Brazilian. The journey was in the\
  \ night and we were a few days from Christmas. I remember she was very kind , and\
  \ help me a lot when we first arrived to Paris , and how to use the metro station.\
  \ When we travel around the world is fascinating to reach people and find out we\
  \ are all looking for the same happiness and beautiful stories so powerful to share\
  \ and is a gift to learn about other cultures and unique personal path. Being in\
  \ Paris in Christmas was an adventure, first of all I stayed in my friend flat ,\
  \ she shared with her mother , only one bed and bathroom , kitchen in the same four\
  \ square area. My friend come from a Arabic family , and the Christmas with them\
  \ was a bliss . I didn't bring any gifts because I only travel with a backpack ,\
  \ however people I didn't knew at all , parents of my friend , gave me little extraordinary\
  \ presents , that I feel like home and also the food.... I need to stop here for\
  \ a while , we had an amazing amount of chesses , of all kind you could imagine\
  \ ..from blue to standard salt yellow , to the delicate brie. They prepare some\
  \ dishes from Lebanon , similar to a meat ball and of course hummus. After having\
  \ dinner , we grab a guitar and begun to singing songs and having so much fun .\
  \ For me , was a beautiful Christmas were the most precious gift was to be touch\
  \ by the human nature so kind and joyful. \nI hope you go out there and visit that\
  \ friend you meet one time , who lives in another country where you can share amazing\
  \ stories and create new ones for life ."
