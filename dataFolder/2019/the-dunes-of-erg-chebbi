Text: "They say that God shaped these dunes. The land around Merzouga was once a flourishing\
  \ jungle, the wealthy populus enjoyed a life of plenty with want for nothing. But,\
  \ when a poor young woman seeking refuge collapsed at their outskirts, the entire\
  \ village turned their backs. \nGod was displeased at the villagers selfishness\
  \ and sent to them his divine punishment. Terrible sandstorms lanced through their\
  \ homes, turning buildings to rubble. The land of plenty was no more. Where the\
  \ young woman fell the sand enveloped her. The once lush jungle became an arid wasteland.\
  \ Her body is now buried under Erg Chebbi; perhaps Morocco's grandest and most spectacular\
  \ sea of dunes. \n\nI'm not religious, but it's a good story.\n\nThe bus rolled\
  \ to a halt at, what would be too generous to call a bus stop. Originating in Fez,\
  \ for 13 hours I had crossed the mountains and arid plains of the Western Sahara,\
  \ hoping to find my authentic desert experience. I had arranged to meet a man called\
  \ Mohammed on the Eastern outskirts of the village, so that is where I went. The\
  \ streets were desolate, crumbling buildings hedged me as I made my way down winding\
  \ sand roads. Before long the village disappeared, and before me was the yawning\
  \ expanse of open desert. Erg Chebbi towered above me stretching far into the distance;\
  \ rising 150 metres above the surrounding sands. \n\nA small group of people stood\
  \ next to a signpost staring out into the desert. They whispered a mixture of foreign\
  \ languages. I approached and we waited almost in silence for something to happen;\
  \ the sun slowly rising above the peaks of the dunes. Far in the distance, silhouetted\
  \ by the sands, a man made his way towards us leading a flock of camels. His sapphire\
  \ blue touareg billowing around him. This had to be Mohammed. He approached, picturesque\
  \ and ancient; he could have leapt directly from the pages of a history book. Mohammed\
  \ grinned widely at us, his scarce yellow teeth catching the sunlight. \u201CWelcome\u201D\
  \ he said in a thick accent. \u201CI will take you to camp\u201D gesturing to the\
  \ sands behind him.\n\nThen he beeped. He pulled a latest generation iphone from\
  \ the folds of his robe. \u201CCome, it is time to go\u201D.\n\nAs we left civilization\
  \ behind, riding our camels into the endless expanse, trying not to be thrown face\
  \ first into the sand; I began to feel very small.\n\nWe made camp in a small valley\
  \ between the dunes. A lack of light pollution resulted in the entire milky way\
  \ galaxy projected into the night sky.\n\nThe rest of my group left the day after,\
  \ but I was determined to have my dream fulfilling desert experience. For the next\
  \ few days it was just me, Mohammed, and the camels. My favourite of which was called\
  \ Ziggy Stardust.\n\nOn the third day I was struck by sickness. Moroccan food is\
  \ delicious of course. But. Can wreak havoc on the unprepared western stomach. Tepid\
  \ bottled water and mint tea were not much of a relief. Mohammed looked at me worried,\
  \ and put a halt on the days activities. \u201CSit down, I will make you another\
  \ mint tea\u201D\n\u201CThat would be amazing\u201D I said with a smile, hoping\
  \ I was masking my horror effectively.\n\nAfter pouring the lovingly prepared tea\
  \ into the nearest lump of sand, I excused myself and took myself up to the top\
  \ of one of the tallest dunes around. Hoping to communicate with the ancient spirit\
  \ of the sand... or at least ease the pain in my gut. The wind blew through my hair\
  \ and the sand formed a lovely bed. Hours later I awoke, baked as hard and dry as\
  \ beef jerky. I'll tell you what's not an effective stomach relief remedy. Heatstroke.\n\
  \nI stumbled back to camp, Mohammed looked shocked, \u201CWhere have you been? I\
  \ thought you were lost!\u201D I thanked him for his concern but now was not the\
  \ time for small talk. Overcome by a sudden need, I sprinted over to a close outcropping\
  \ of sand and vomited three days of mint tea and couscous into the ground. \n\n\
  Thus my magical Saharan desert experience came to its natural conclusion."
