Text: "Honks. A cacophony of honks. That's New Delhi's noisy welcome to anyone who\
  \ ventures into this bustling metropolis. But it wasn't noise to me. It was music\
  \ to my ears. It was the music to signal the start of my journey from Delhi to the\
  \ hidden paradise of Kasol - a charming village built into the mountain slopes of\
  \ Himachal Pradesh.\n\nAll I need to do was to take that rickety old midnight bus\
  \ first. Easier said that done. But I did it. The smiling faces helped to relive\
  \ the anxiety but just a little. As the bus geared out of the depot and slowly left\
  \ New Delhi, the other passengers killed time with some Bollywood tunes. It was\
  \ easy listening. Melodic and with just enough soul to affect my now haphazard sleep\
  \ pattern. Before I knew it, my eyelids shut and time passed faster as I slept through\
  \ the night.\n\n12 hours later and bus conductor's throaty coughs woke me up from\
  \ my slumber. Not the best start to my morning. My back was tight, my shoulders\
  \ heavy. But as I got off the bus, I stepped into heaven. \n\nA cool breeze caressed\
  \ my skin - nature's subtle way of waking up my senses. As I looked around, all\
  \ I saw was snow-capped mountains looming over me. The village of Kasol was just\
  \ 100 metres away, across a bridge. It was magnificent. A ragtag cluster of humble\
  \ abodes nestled into the slope of a mountain. As I crossed the bridge slowly reaching\
  \ my destination, the confusing smells wafted towards me.\n\nI expected the beauty.\
  \ I expected cold. I even expected the thin air high in the altitudes but what I\
  \ certainly didn't expect was the aroma of Indian cuisine wrestling with the fragrance\
  \ of hummus and tahini. Yes, you read that correctly. Israeli food holding its own\
  \ in the tiny village in Himachal Pradesh. \n\nAnd that's where my journey truly\
  \ began. My physical journey had already begun a few days earlier but now, having\
  \ finally stepped into Kasol, my journey towards knowledge finally jump started\
  \ into gear. Its where I met a family of Israeli's who left their homeland more\
  \ than fifteen years ago and found another Home in Kasol. It's where I met Liev,\
  \ an Israeli hippie who discovered Kasol on a holiday and has never left in more\
  \ than eight years. \n\nI spent a week in Kasol. I trekked through the meadows,\
  \ the mountain slopes and hidden fields of marijuana plants (don't ask). I sat with\
  \ Indian, Nepali and Israeli families sharing their lunches and dinners. I had crisp\
  \ masala chai with every stranger I met. Smiles were abundant, frowns were a rarity.\
  \  The nights got cold but I kept warm with bonfires and sipped whiskey. \n\nLife\
  \ here was simple and people were happy. Joy wasn't something the people were searching\
  \ for. It just was. Like breathing. \n\nIt's been a year since I found and spent\
  \ a week in heaven. Now I'm back in Singapore. Back to the daily grind of work and\
  \ worries. But every once in a while, time stands still for me. In a moment of quiet,\
  \ I remember my time in Kasol. I can see the mountains and smiling faces and smell\
  \ the food. But what I remember is the joy. Because its still with me. I've never\
  \ let it go and I never will."
