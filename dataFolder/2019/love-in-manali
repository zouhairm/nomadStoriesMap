Text: "You know as you travel for passion, you travel for love.i found love in my\
  \ adventures  and also found love with my travel buddy.As they say, weather grows\
  \ gloomy and February drags on, perhaps there is no greater respite from late winter\
  \ than the flake of its snow.  Whether married, dating, or single, there is joy\
  \ to be found in love stories,particularly when that story is a chance encounter\
  \ while traveling.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that travel is conducive to romance, travelling\
  \ is not just vacation but also a love, passion and dedication to the people around\
  \ you.\n\nI did not find love in Paris nor in Venice, but found love with my travel\
  \ buddy. My travel buddy is an intern from many photographic companies and she would\
  \ always call me when ever she travels, so I would collect money by working in part\
  \ time jobs to travel with her.\n\nI met my travel buddy in London in a bloggers\
  \ meet, and agreed to be partners in Medium, we were just catching up and talked\
  \ all night to which I invited her  in my travel.\n\nSo she and I planned our trip\
  \ to India in Manali. we first started our journey from Delhi and travel on the\
  \ bus to Himachal Pradesh and started our exciting journey.\n\nDay 1 \n\nWe set\
  \ our first destination to to a village in Bir, we stayed in a place like hotel\
  \ called zostel. A place where you can meet any travellers who are from foreign\
  \ country or near by and used to talk about our travels. We would sing in the campfire,\
  \ tell stories, share our adventures together and also would talk about our dangerous\
  \ yet exciting stories\n\nBir I might say was the most peaceful village, known for\
  \ the peaceful destination in Himachal Pradesh, Bir has exquisite taste for culture,\
  \ food, ancient place and mostly hills.\n\nWe set course to a monestry temple called\
  \ the Chockling Monestry which was located in the Tibetan valley. We had to walk\
  \ to the temple. And we got to see the statue of statue of Padmasambhava and let's\
  \ not forget Sherab Ling Monastery as it is been surrounded by beautiful forests.\n\
  \nThen we drove ourselves to  the waterfalls of bir. Just a 1 hour hiking we  got\
  \ to see the beautiful falls and fresh air. \n\nThen we set our next stop to paragliding.Bir\
  \ Billing is recognized as the paragliding place  of India. It's a prime attraction\
  \ for adventure seekers from all throughout the world for the same. There are a\
  \ number of training programs that you can get in touch with for the said purpose.\n\
  \n\n\nDay 2 \n\nWe set to our main destination Manali, when you hear the word Manali\
  \ it freshens you up. It's actually a family looking for some bonding time, a couple\
  \ for some peace and quiet, solo travellers for some solitude or a group of friends\
  \ seeking an adventure. We didn't do much as we wanted to explore the markets there.\
  \ We got to take home cooked food especially Maggi. They were rich with pure fresh\
  \ fruits. These fruits are been freshly took and sold to the streets. But they might\
  \ be expensive.\n\nDay 3 \n\nSo we set ourselves next to solang then to Rohtak pass,\
  \ it was magical bowled over by the lush green winding roads that slowly lead to\
  \ snow. At parts of the Rohtang Pass, the snow never melts. Which means what you\
  \ see and hold in your hands, could very well be ancient snow. Be a child once again,\
  \ and let loose as you play in the snow. More than me my travel partner loved it,\
  \ we really enjoyed climbing the mountains to set course to our camp to the peak\
  \ of Rohtak pass, though cold we survived and got cuts and bruises while climbing.\
  \ But that's worth the adventure.\n\nwe found ourselves close to eachother as me\
  \ and my partner were always like a team and he was always by my side. Coming to\
  \ Manali found us danger and also found us love. On 16 the February I proposed to\
  \  her and she accepted and it was the greatest memory of my life. Without her \
  \ adventures would not be enjoyable."
