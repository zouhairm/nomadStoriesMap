Text: "\u2018Tonight, on BBC news at 10, a terrorist claiming allegiance to the Islamic\
  \ State was\u2026 Brexit talks at a standstill after another MP vote\u2026 Trump\
  \ addresses the UN on\u2026\u2019. This was the soundtrack to my life, a never-ending,\
  \ all-encompassing cycle of negative news and the diffusion of fear. It swirled\
  \ around in my head, it even tapped into my subconscious and manifested in my nightmares.\
  \ I needed some form of respite. A voyage of discovery\u2026 that\u2019s what it\u2019\
  s called, right? Whatever the label, I needed it, with every ounce of my body. I\
  \ was engulfed in this vacuum, this downward spiral of pressure from those around\
  \ me, from society \u2013 and most importantly from myself \u2013 to stay afloat,\
  \ keep my head bobbing above the tide of expectations. But here, I could succumb\
  \ to an unequivocal feeling of peace, everything was still, the outside world didn\u2019\
  t matter now, even for a mere few days.\n\nHere I was, in nature\u2019s dramatically\
  \ carved Grand Canyon, formed by the majestically rising and turbulent river rapids,\
  \ older than I could even fathom, and something which would outlive every one of\
  \ us. My hike was a desperate attempt to re-evaluate my purpose, my role. As the\
  \ sun rose above the horizon, I watched the ever-changing play of light and shadows\
  \ in hues of salmon-pink, deep-orange and a breath-taking violet projected upon\
  \ the rock in front of me. I couldn\u2019t help but ponder the curves of the treacherous\
  \ and unique beauty of the unfolding splendour around me. My imagination was set\
  \ free to wonder about those who had passed through, their reasons for doing so,\
  \ the physical and mental stamina endured. Yet, I found it fitting that I was battling\
  \ with a different mental test. I was fleeing something, but what? My day-to-day,\
  \ perhaps?\n\nJust as I was gazing into space \u2013 or maybe at the few dew drops\
  \ hanging on the leaves of the vegetation that managed to survive this heat \u2013\
  \ immersed in my own thoughts, a man approached me. He gave me a knowing look and\
  \ made a gesture asking if he could join me. He was older, bearded, with speckles\
  \ of grey that you would think would indicate wisdom and experience, but not this\
  \ time. Instead, he looked just as lost as I did. We sat there, silent yet oddly\
  \ comfortable for being in the company of a stranger and, after what felt like eternity,\
  \ he turned to me, looked so deep into my eyes as if he were searching my soul and\
  \ asked, \u2018Where are you going in life?\u2019 It was an inherently personal\
  \ question wrapped up in a completely impersonal encounter. I felt choked, in the\
  \ freshest and most smog-less air I had every breathed. I was used to introductory\
  \ questions such as \u2018what\u2019s your name?\u2019, \u2018where do you come\
  \ from?\u2019, but never this. A simple question like this, that I cautiously answered,\
  \ gave way to what felt like hours of conversation, laughter, even tears; happy\
  \ or sad? Neither of us knew at this point. \n\nSuddenly, we were interrupted by\
  \ the nature that enveloped us. We looked up. Soaring high above, helped along by\
  \ the thermals in the air, was the huge, black shape of a condor, gliding effortlessly\
  \ and silently, silhouetted against the multi-toned sky. It reminded us that stress\
  \ here didn\u2019t exist, the hectic society we had come from and become fully accustomed\
  \ to felt further away than ever before. Our encounter connected us personally,\
  \ yet simultaneously disconnected us from news channels, blogs, social media, anything\
  \ that sucked the happiness out of our lives, that contributed to any personal issues.\
  \ The labyrinth of paths and journeys that can be taken through the canyon of untrampled\
  \ wilderness is complex and reminded me of the paths we can take in life. Some paths\
  \ were flanked by vast, steep sides of limestone, embodying toil and danger. Others\
  \ were calm and serene, like walking out onto a silent theatre stage where many\
  \ dramas had occurred, but all was silent there now. It was an instance that awakened\
  \ my curiosity and conjured up renewed guidance in life I never knew existed. Just\
  \ standing there completely still and contemplating life in this enchanting place,\
  \ moved me beyond words."
