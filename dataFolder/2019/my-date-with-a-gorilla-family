Text: "I arrive at the Visitor Centre at National Volcano Park near Ruhngeri by 7:30\
  \ am in a Jeep. It is a bright cold morning. An orange sky with navy blue mountains\
  \ greets me. The first few rays of light are beginning to peek out of the horizon.\
  \ I inhale the fresh mountain air and I am preparing for the unfamiliar. I head\
  \ towards the reception office to complete paperwork. I have been assigned to group\
  \ 8 and I am going to meet the Hirwa (Lucky) gorillas. Our guides greet our group\
  \ in the centre of the park and brief us on our trek.\n\nWe drive two miles over\
  \ a rough ground of uneven stones. I carry my backpack which holds a few bananas,\
  \ biscuits and water. The guide gives me a supporting stick to help the climb. Two\
  \ guides, two forest rangers, and two porters support the group. We walk along a\
  \ narrow pathway between Irish Potato fields. The countryside is lush and quiet.\
  \ After thirty minutes, the guides tell us to walk slowly without making noise.\
  \ We are also provided instructions in case nature calls. We start climbing. From\
  \ now on, it is roadless wilderness. The trek becomes steeper and I am grasping\
  \ for something to hang on to. After an hour, I feel tired. I don\u2019t know if\
  \ it was from the arduous hike or from the growing anxiety, I start to feel fatigued\
  \ and want to slow down. My body perspires, I am completely soaked and want to turn\
  \ back, yet I do not see any hope of an early return. My guides encourage me to\
  \ drink water and have a banana. After another hour of climb, good news comes that\
  \ one ranger has sighted a gorilla family member close by. The ranger clears the\
  \ brush to make some path for us. It is time to offload all our stuff including\
  \ the walking sticks. Only phones and cameras are allowed. \n\nThe guides teach\
  \ us a few gestures and sounds to communicate with gorillas. All of a sudden, I\
  \ spot one. My guides tell me that this is a baby and is three years old. It is\
  \ fascinating to watch this lovely animal in the forest. She is playing, feeding,\
  \ and jumping around from one branch to the other. Another baby joins and the guides\
  \ tell me that they are twins. I feel immense joy watching them. All feelings of\
  \ discomfort, fatigue and physical pain vanish at the sight of these two gorillas.\
  \ All is calm and quiet except the nibbling of the leaves by gorillas. There is\
  \ a slight breeze. The movement of leaves is gentle, soft, and wavy. As both babies\
  \ are playing and fighting, the mother joins them. I feel a growing anxiety after\
  \ realizing her massive size and intimidating gait, but a guide asks me to step\
  \ aside quietly so that the she can access her babies directly.\n\nAs our group\
  \ members are taking photographs, more of this gorilla family arrive along the same\
  \ path. At last, comes the father- the guides say his name is Munyinga, the only\
  \ silver streak gorilla in the group. The silver on his back glistens in the sunshine.\
  \ Guides tell me that Munyinga is 37 years old.  All of these majestic animals are\
  \ busy playing, feeding, talking to each other. One of them is hitting his chest\
  \ with both the hands and grunting. I spot another helping the little ones climb.\
  \ After an hour of mingling with the Hirwa gorillas, we bid adieu to the family\
  \ and our guides show us an easy path to descend. I part ways with the trekking\
  \ team and I leave behind the magnificent volcanoes. As we head back to the city\
  \ of Kigali, a sense of joy and accomplishment overcomes me. My feelings of anxiety\
  \ and fatigue are soon replaced with an awesome experience and memories that I will\
  \ never forget."
