Text: "We left from LaGuardia at about 2:30 pm and flew for an hour to Toronto before\
  \ catching a connector flight to Port of Spain. My first day in Trinidad we headed\
  \ to Lookout Point. Which was basically a view positioned on this beautiful mountain\
  \ with a road that seemed to swerve until it reached the clouds. The further we\
  \ drove into the mountain the richer the culture became. We stopped on our way thru\
  \ the mountain at a snow cone stand. I never ever thought pina colada and Hennessy\
  \ could mesh.\n\n     After spending an hour or so at the beach we all worked up\
  \ an appetite. So we headed to another section of the beach to get some shark and\
  \ bake. I never had shark so I was really excited about the experience. The shark\
  \ was fried and the batter was almost sweet. There was a toppings bar at the beach\
  \ including sauces and almost any veggie you could imagine. \n\n     We came home\
  \ and crashed because our next day would be spent traveling to Tobago. We left the\
  \ house around 8:30 and was boarding a flight around 9:30 a.m. The flight was only\
  \ about 20 mins. As soon as we reached Tobago the air changed. The water was crystal\
  \ clear and the air seemed to rejuvenate you. We spent a couple hours on the beach\
  \ and then decided to take a tour on another boat.\n\n     \u201CFrankie\u2019s\
  \ Tours\u201D blessed us with an experience like no other.\nWe left from a dock\
  \ on Tobago and the first stop was snorkeling in the middle of the most beautiful\
  \ water I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\n     The one thing about our voyage was the water\
  \ was very choppy only really on the earlier portion of the voyage. The second stop\
  \ was mind blowing we were at least 30 mins into the sea when we stopped and the\
  \ captain said hop off the boat. We had reached a place where the water was knee\
  \ level and you could get out and literally walk on the sea. \n\nThis lead to a\
  \ free for all on the jetski. I met #JetskiJesus who was really inspiring.\n\n \
  \    He told me of how he moved here years ago and his life was full. He had no\
  \ complaints and I honestly felt the islands were my speed. So my next trip was\
  \ definitely to visit my family in  Nevis and Barbados! I will for sure be back\
  \ to Trinidad and Tobago. \n\nPlease check out my journey from Thailand to Cambodia\
  \ and more on my blog at www.Trapfleur.com. I look forward to hearing from you guys\
  \ ! I went to Pennstate for journalism so this is truly a dream!"
