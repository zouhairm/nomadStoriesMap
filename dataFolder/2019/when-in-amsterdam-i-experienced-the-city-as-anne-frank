Text: "Who wants to visit the city, needs to know that there are three different cities:\
  \ first, there is a romantic and colorful Amsterdam with Windmills, Tulips and Canals;\
  \ second, there is a cultural Amsterdam, land of famous painters like Van Gogh and\
  \ Rembrandt van Rijn; ultimately there is fascinating historical Amsterdam that\
  \ survived the Nazi occupation.  \nFortunately, Amsterdam was not bombed in Second\
  \ World War. In other words, traveler will not see destroyed buildings \u2013 like\
  \ those still visible in Germany \u2013 but traveler can experience the horrors\
  \ of the War in the city visiting Anne Frank House, the place in which the little\
  \ Jewish girl Frank wrote her famous diary while in hiding from Nazi.  \nHowever,\
  \ it is not an easy task to visit the Anne Frank House because the place always\
  \ has a huge queue of visitors. In my special case, I could not buy tickets because\
  \ the place was under renovation. I was very frustrated, after all, I had just read\
  \ the Anne Frank\xB4s diary had only a few months. In this moment, I remembered\
  \ that \u201CAnne Frank House\u201D was not the \u201Chouse\u201D, but the annex\
  \ that Anne spent the last years of her life. So, talking with some locals, I asked\
  \ where Anne had lived in Amsterdam and a nice gentleman gave me the direction:\
  \ Rivierenbuurt, a neighborhood where many Jews lived in the 1930s. \nLeaving from\
  \ the historic and agitated center, I went to Rivierenbuurt on foot. Almost an hour\
  \ after hiking, I found a small and old bookstore named Jimmink. My heart stops.\
  \ Was the bookstore at where Otto Frank bought Anne's diary. I walked a few more\
  \ steps, turned the corner and there she was, as the kind gentleman had told me:\
  \ a statue of Anne in the middle of a square surrounded by small buildings. The\
  \ buildings were all the same, built with exposed bricks but finding Anne's house\
  \ was easy thereafter, since, in front of each house of a persecuted Jew, there\
  \ is a golden plaque with its name on the sidewalk. It is possible to find some\
  \ more plaques in front of other houses in the same square, since just like the\
  \ Frank family, their neighbors were also persecuted. Looking up and facing the\
  \ building where Anne lived, as well as looking at the square where she possibly\
  \ joked and ran in childhood was exciting.\nBefore I left, I stole flowers from\
  \ the square and left them at the foot of the statue of Anne with other flowers\
  \ and presents given by admirers like me. This is the best memory I have of Amsterdam."
