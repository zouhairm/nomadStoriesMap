Text: "Our Uber driver arrived late and the traffic in Delhi was disastrous, as usual.\
  \ We \u2013 my friend, Irina and I \u2013 jumped out of the car, literally throwing\
  \ the money on the driver's lap, and we ran. We  started running to the New Delhi\
  \ Railway Station, and immediately a random rikshaw driver started running next\
  \ to us, asking if we are late. \"Der se pahunchee?\" Yes, yes, and we need to run!\
  \ We only have a minute!\u201D \u201EFollow me\u201D he said, and he ran in front\
  \ of us, guiding us through the maze of tuk-tuks and rickshaws that's called parking\
  \ lot over here, leading us to the nearest entrance. He was more concerned about\
  \ us reaching our train than we were, \u201EJaldi jaldi\u201D he shouted! As it\
  \ turned out, with our online ticket we cannot enter the station there, we have\
  \ to go to the other entrance, which \u2013 of course \u2013 is on the other end\
  \ of the station.\nDeep breath, running again, I couldn't feel my shoulders from\
  \ the backpack, my lungs were screaming, I was screaming in hindi to everybody,\
  \ \u201EOut of my way!\u201D. We went through the security, which is the most pointless\
  \ part of this whole system, a metal detector and a conveyor belt, with no staff\
  \ around and no fence to stop anybody going around it. Nobody checks what is in\
  \ my bag, or if I 'beep' because of some electronic device or anything else. It\
  \ feels like, it's just there to slow us down.\nThe train was already in motion\
  \ when we saw it, but I looked at Irina, \u201EJump?\u201D and she nodded. But an\
  \ officer stopped us, \u201EThe train is already leaving, not possible, not possible.\u201D\
  \ We probably wouldn't have been able to jump on it anyway, but my adrenaline said\
  \ otherwise, and I saw a local jumping on it at the last moment, so I was furious.\n\
  The people there were watching us curiously, they smiled and clapped while we were\
  \ running, and when we walked back defeated, with slumped shoulders, they asked\
  \ \u201EKya hua?\u201D\u201EWhat happened?\u201D After my answer, an older man in\
  \ a suit stepped in front of us. He was also going to Agra, and he said we should\
  \ follow him, because there is another train leaving shortly. However we didn't\
  \ have a ticket, and surely it is impossible to buy tickets so close before departure\
  \ anyways, and we didn't even know if the train actually goes to Agra or not. Nevertheless,\
  \ we didn\u2019t have any time to lose, as if we didn't reach Agra in time the school's\
  \ guards might not let us in to our place after hours. When we informed the man\
  \ of our concers in our delightfully imperfect hindi, he just smiled and shaked\
  \ his head, in a tipical indian way that can mean both yes and no, your choice,\
  \ and which I learned to accept during my 7 months in India.\nEventually this second\
  \ train took us back to Agra, and no one came asking for a valid ticket. We thanked\
  \ the man in the suit, who helped us, but he just asked, \u201EKahaa se?\u201D Europe,\
  \ Ukraine, answered Irina, and when I said Hungary, he offered me a piece of his\
  \ food.\nI just shaked my head no, \"I am not hungry.\""
