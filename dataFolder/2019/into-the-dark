Text: "I\u2019ve seen zombie movies that started out like this: a group of college\
  \ kids descend into the mines only to be horrified by what they discover inside.\
  \ If only my experience had been so fortunate. Our downfall wasn\u2019t so much\
  \ what we found in the cave, but what, rather, someone brought in. \n\nI\u2019m\
  \ standing outside the entrance to the silver mines of Kutna Hora, a small Czech\
  \ city known for its chapel made of human skeletons, and my quota for spooky things\
  \ is already at its brim. Czech tourists around me are easily slipping on hard hats\
  \ with flashlights on them and white, pointy-hooded robes. My friend Ashley, the\
  \ only black student of the group, hesitates at the room of pointed hoods and says,\
  \ \u201CGuys, I think I\u2019m on the wrong tour.\u201D Since my classmates and\
  \ I are all from Texas, we\u2019ve seen these clothes before, and it feels very\
  \ sketchy to be donning these hoods. The meaning of this garb is quite lost on the\
  \ other European tourists, however, who are already eagerly start snapping pictures\
  \ of themselves in their hoods with thumbs-up signs for their Instagram. \n\nWe\
  \ punch our helmets to turn the lights on, and my friend is a little too enthusiastic\
  \ about punching mine. As we descend into the mines single-file, the walls start\
  \ to close in. Pretty soon, I\u2019m grateful for my short 5\u20194\u2019\u2019\
  \ stature, as I\u2019m one of the few left standing as everyone else has to crouch\
  \ down to fit in this cave. The walls of the mine are harsh and full of ridges,\
  \ and they roughen my fingertips as I try to keep myself grounded in this dark space.\
  \ The tour guide begins to lead us into a narrow branch of the mines.  There is\
  \ a small protrusion that peaks out over something below. My friends and I wiggle\
  \ forward, and we begin to see glowing green-ish water in the cave. The effect is\
  \ surreal, and I feel like I have just stumbled upon the fountain of life. This\
  \ sacred moment is intruded upon, however, when I sniff the air. It starts to smell\
  \ garlicky, like a lethal combination of spices someone had bottled up to protect\
  \ mankind from. Unfortunately, for those of us in the cave, someone had opened Pandora\u2019\
  s box and let a big one rip. \n\nThe thing to note before stepping into a cave is\
  \ that caves are closed spaces. The thing to know about stepping into a cave with\
  \ twenty other people is that when the cave is single-file, it takes a while to\
  \ pass through a space. Smell also travels\u2026fast. The next few moments are tense\
  \ as my classmates and I are all sizing each other up. We communicate nonverbally\
  \ with furrowed eyebrows and pursed lips, \u201CWas it you?\u201D we accuse silently.\
  \ Through a series of emphatic head nods, it\u2019s determined that the culprit\
  \ has to be among the other tourists. Maybe it\u2019s the friendly grandfather with\
  \ the thick glasses, or the mom with curly hair. We take no chances: we give them\
  \ a wide berth and maintain constant vigilance on them for the rest of the tour.\n\
  \nTowards the end, our tour guide has us turn off the flashlights on our hats. We\u2019\
  re plunged into complete darkness. It\u2019s terrifying. I stretch out my hand,\
  \ but light is completely absent, and I feel as if I\u2019m staring at the back\
  \ of my eyelids. My sense of hearing becomes incredibly acute as someone\u2019s\
  \ cough, probably the farter if I\u2019m being honest, echoes throughout the space\
  \ and I can pinpoint their location with my ears. If I ever get out of this case,\
  \ I think to myself, I\u2019ll make a killer assassin. The tour guide, a native\
  \ Czech, begins to explain that sometimes the miners\u2019 supplies would fail,\
  \ and they would have to navigate their way back in the dark. As we turn our flashlights\
  \ back on and walk out of the cave into the light of the normal human world, I\u2019\
  m amazed by the courage, patience, and persistence of the silver miners. I couldn\u2019\
  t even handle an \u201Cinnocuous\u201D fart or a few minutes without flashlights.\
  \ I needed just a few moments of darkness to bring perspective into light."
