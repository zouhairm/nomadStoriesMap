Text: 'It was my first time to visit Japan and spent winter time in Hokkaido. The
  first city to be visited are Monbetsu, a small seaside town and very beautiful during
  winter because its fully covered by snow. With temperatures up to -10 degrees Celsius,
  city with a crab as the icon - because it has a distinctive type of crab with long
  legs and can only live in the cold sea like in this city. In addition, I was visiting
  Kiao Park - a snow play area, Sea ice GIZA Museum and Sky Tower - to see the city
  Monbetsu landscape from up above.


  The journey continue to the next day, to the area of Kamikawagun districk approximately
  2 hours drive from Monbetsu. In here, I stay at Hotel Taisetsu Sounkyo-onsen, surrounded
  by a snowy pine hills make me enjoyed the time to linger and relaxing in a comfortable
  hotel room, looking at the beautiful scenery outside.

  Here I visit Drift Ice Breaker, Okhotsk Tower and attended Sounkyo Ice Festival.


  Prior to the last city of Sapporo, I  visited Asahiyama Zoo and can see from the
  distant of the cold region animals such as penguins, polar bears and seals that
  can not be found in any region. Dont want to missed the moment? I also taking pictures
  in Otaru Canal legendary.


  Not only enjoying the sightseeing of these beautiful landscape of Japan and visit
  places of interest, I also spoiled with typical Japanese food like Sushi, Yakiniku,
  Chawanmushi, Dashi, Tempura, Shabu-Shabu and many more.'
