Text: "Arriving in Yangon one September day, I was a bundle of excitement and nerves\
  \ as I smelled the distinct earthy smell of the city I would come to love. Myanmar\
  \ was, in my mind, exotic and unspoiled, where few have touched ground before. Traveling\
  \ alone made it that much more exciting.\n\nWalking through the streets, the stark\
  \ difference in daily life to South Africa was striking. Sidewalks and streets covered\
  \ in material, plastic and wooden crates with an abundance of local produce. Green,\
  \ orange, yellow, white, red \u2013 the fish, fruit, rice and vegetables were the\
  \ freshest you\u2019ll ever see.  Avoiding the street sellers was not the only task;\
  \ you have to dodge the red splashes on the pavements. Many of the locals chew betel\
  \ nut and, once finished, spit out the red substance wherever they are. \n\nThe\
  \ Burmese people, ever smiling, were just as curious of me as I was of them. Although\
  \ tourist numbers are increasing in the country, it\u2019s still an oddity for them\
  \ to see someone like me walking through their streets alone. Immersing myself in\
  \ the atmosphere, I continued walking toward a tall, column structure ahead of me.\
  \ The Independence Monument is situated within the luscious and green Maha Bandula\
  \ Park. Taking the opportunity to \u2018people watch\u2019, I sat on a bench and\
  \ observed the comings and goings of the locals.\n\n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\
  , were the words that snapped me out of my own thoughts. I\u2019d walked by many\
  \ people, with smiles exchanged along the way, but nobody had spoken to me. I locked\
  \ eyes with a young Burmese man, jet black hair and smiling eyes, who took a seat\
  \ beside me. \u201CSouth Africa\u201D, I responded enthusiastically, relishing in\
  \ the opportunity to converse with a local that could speak English.\n\nShwe, dressed\
  \ in a traditional longyi, was in his early twenties and originally from a rural\
  \ village a few hundred kilometres from Yangon. \u201CIn my village there is no\
  \ work other than on a farm.\u201D With the lure of the big city and wanting more\
  \ for his life, he moved to the former capital two years earlier to further his\
  \ education. Family is everything in Myanmar and is parents were fully supportive,\
  \ able to save the money to get him here. Shwe works part-time to support himself\
  \ while he\u2019s studying and lives in the back quarters of the restaurant he works\
  \ in. \u201CI\u2019m here, living my dream and that\u2019s what\u2019s most important.\u201D\
  \n\nStudying to become a tour guide, he takes every opportunity to practice his\
  \ English with Westerners. Shwe was eager to hear about myself and South Africa,\
  \ just as much as I wanted to know more about his life and Myanmar. Hearing of all\
  \ the places I was scheduled to visit, Shwe listened keenly and, by his reactions\
  \ of encouragement, made me even more excited for my trip.\n\nThrilled when Shwe\
  \ introduced me to some of his friends, I was intrigued by all the stories of how\
  \ they ended up in Yangon. As different as their stories were, all shared the same\
  \ desire for \u2018more\u2019. As the afternoon sun glistened across the gold Sule\
  \ Pagoda in the distance, a few hours of conversation flew by as I learnt more about\
  \ Myanmar through its own people, setting the scene for my next two weeks travelling\
  \ across the country. \n\nAfter a tumultuous and violent history, Myanmar\u2019\
  s people are rising above and sharing the beauty of the country and the love they\
  \ possess."
