Text: "\"LIVE, LAUGH, LOVE AND TRAVEL\" that's my motto in life. At the age of 23\
  \ I travelled here in Taiwan basically for work! Until one day I was diagnosed with\
  \ orbital myositis on my left eye causing my eyelid's muscle to swell and giving\
  \ me double vision. It caused me alot of pain and even affected my work! It was\
  \ heart-breaking and so terrifying and so I  decided to be alone and unwind in the\
  \ Monkey mountain. I keep walking miles and miles away until I got lost in a beautiful\
  \ paradaise. I raised my head up high saw how bright the sky, I breath fresh air\
  \ then looked around and get mesmerized with the beauty of green trees,chirping\
  \ of birds, swinging monkeys on branches and way down there  the waves of the blue\
  \ sea\U0001F60A\n     That time I realized that as job fills your pocket, Adventure\
  \ fills your soul! And nothing more is as therapeutic as the relaxing breath taking\
  \ nature around you. As I was taking steroids for medication I often went travelling\
  \ around Taiwan whenever I get the chance too with my friends which helped me totally\
  \ heal!\n   I went to see the Sun Moon Lake park and Aboriginal village in Nantou,\
  \ Xinshe Sea of Flowers, Houli flower farm in Taichung, Black Castle and Summit\
  \ resort, the cascading \nPingtung Waterfalls, Chiayi Waterfalls, Kenting Beach\
  \ and Nat'l Park, Kenting Marine Biology Aquarium, MoonWorld, Lotus Pond, Tamsui!\n\
  \    Travelling around makes me understand more the culture,religion and tradition\
  \ of people here in Taiwan. I realized how things were after visiting some museums\
  \ and art galleries like Taiwan Nat'l museum, Salt museum,Fongyi Academy (museum),\
  \ British Consulate of Takao, Fort Zealandia, Anping Old Tree, Lion Tiger Pagodas,\
  \ Chikhan Tower, Jiufen Old Streets, Chiang kai shek memorial place, Shillin, and\
  \ many others!\n    Thru travelling that I was able to taste lots of  mouth-watering\
  \ Taiwanese delicacies and street foods at night markets and local restos! \nOn\
  \ the lists are Machang, stinky tofu, deep fry tofu and mushrooms, chiPai, Takoyaki,\
  \ hotpot zhabu zhabu,tea bubbles, mochi, dough pie with onion leaves, fried noodles\
  \ and saucy steak on hot plate, pig's blood with rice and fried Itik to name a few!\n\
  \    I will always cherish the memories of having my first super Adrenaline rush\
  \ with extreme rides on some themed parks here in   Taiwan. I almost lost breath\
  \ on yelling as I ride the UFO, MAYAN Adventure, and carribean splash at Sun Moon\
  \ lake. I almost throwed up riding the J5 at Janfusan Fancy World and the 360 degrees\
  \ Aladdin ride at Leofoo Village. My heartbeat almost went on horizontal line as\
  \ I took ride on 90 degrees roller coaster and 360 Viking ride at Liphao Land! There\
  \ are also rides which indulge my sense like the Maokong Gondola Cable car which\
  \ u can take to see the view of the entire Taipei Zoo, Formosan Cable Car which\
  \ stretches around 2.2 km crossing 3 mountains, gives u a better view of the Sun\
  \ Moon Lake.\n   One of my most unforgettable adventure is hiking on Alishan Forestry\
  \ where I saw some of the oldest trees in the planet which lived thousands of years\
  \ ago. Due to my curiousity, I tried to read every detailed captions on each tree\
  \ to the point that it was too late that me and my friends already missed the last\
  \ trip of the train which took us there! And so what we did is to follow the train\
  \ route but at the middle we found two diverged railways and guess what, we reached\
  \ a cliff (dead end with a hanging voodoo doll) as we walked in the wrong railway!\n\
  It's getting dark when we found a  certain community which helps us get back to\
  \ our car! Thanks God we are safe!\n   Thru travelling I was able to meet new friends,\
  \ strengthen the bond between us, and even meet some travel buddies who I had relationships\
  \ with. \n   Truly travelling gives me serendipity moment to cherish, to reminisce\
  \ and laugh at when I get old! There's alot more that the world has to offer, and\
  \ I hope to travel more, this time to different countries! wishful thinking?\nOh\
  \ no...I will and I definitely live to travel!"
