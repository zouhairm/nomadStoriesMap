Text: "Well, I would like to start this story, talking about a trip that changed my\
  \ life. I am a young woman who lives in the northeast of Brazil, in a city called\
  \ Campina Grande. I have lived my whole life here, and until 2015 I had never travelled\
  \ by plane, and even more abroad, although the destiny or only a coincidence changed\
  \ this scenario. In 2014, Brazil hosted the Fifa World Cup, so then I went to Recife\
  \ to watch a match between Greece and Costa Rica, but I could not imagine that I\
  \ would met a friend there from Germany, and we only talked for five minutes, and\
  \ he said: When you want to go to Berlin, you only need the flight tickets, because\
  \ I can host you there. \nOne month later, I applied into a contest by Bosch, it\
  \ was the Bosch World Experience 2014, and I won a Ticket around the world, which\
  \ I could choose the country that I wanted, I could not believe that this was real.\
  \ The point is that I only won the flights, but I had no money to go and spend there,\
  \ I was about to graduate, but I had to work in order to save money to go. Immediately\
  \ I found a job, first one was to take the passport, I sold some English books and\
  \ worked giving flyers, after this I got a job in a call center, where I worked\
  \ for 4 months and saved money to go to Europe. \nHere we go, with everything going\
  \ well, had arrived the most breathtaking experience of my life! I was in an airplane\
  \ crossing the Atlantic Ocean alone; it was unbelievable for someone that never\
  \ had gone to a metropole before! My first stop was in Berlin, at my friend\u2019\
  s apartment that I met during the World Cup. The airplane was about to land, I could\
  \ not hold my tears seeing the TV Tower from the window, When I arrived there, it\
  \ was in a mix of gratitude, enthusiasm, adrenaline, passion, but never afraid to\
  \ step in the unknown. During this trip I could learn more about myself, I could\
  \ see that the world is much more than the place that I was born, I will never forget\
  \ this experience that made me grow and mature in a short of time. \nBerlin was\
  \ fascinating; it is a city that had a sad past, but nowadays is so alive, like\
  \ a phoenix. To be there, walking by the berlin wall and realizing that I was there,\
  \ walking beside the history of the world, something which was only possible in\
  \ my history\u2019s books when I was at Elementary school. I jumped into the vibe\
  \ of that place; I could feel the anguish in the Jewish memorial, as I could see\
  \ the lifestyle of many refugees there, people of around the world.  After some\
  \ days in Berlin, I went to Paris, the city of love was always a dream to me, I\
  \ was not afraid of going there alone, It was just few days after the terrorist\
  \ attack to Charlie\u2019s Journal. I spent two days there, suddenly going by train\
  \ from the small village Joey en Josas, listening to Louis Armstrong\u2019s song\
  \ \u201CLa vie en rose\u201D one more time, my heart were melting seeing the lights\
  \ of the Eiffel Tower, Yes, I was there! I was under the Eiffel Tower, walking through\
  \ Paris streets with an Indian friend whose I met there, drinking wine from the\
  \ bottle at Pont des Arts. It was a new version of me, living the dreams that always\
  \ believed it could become reality. Travel for an unknown place may let us vulnerable,\
  \ yet it can give us memories for a lifetime. We only need to take the first step."
