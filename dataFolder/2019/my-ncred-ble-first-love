Text: "He kept saying we were going to travel together, but as much as I longed to\
  \ travel the world, I could not bring myself to believe him. Why? I have dated a\
  \ few guys, who ended up leaving me because they relocated to other countries. They\
  \ had different excuses to break, rather than travel together. Now this young scientist\
  \ is promising what the others before him could not do... that is to keep me in\
  \ his career plans and dreams. We are both Nigerians, from middle-class families.\
  \ I was in my final year in the University; he was on his doctoral studies.\nFast\
  \ forward, in 2010, a year into our relationship, he won a research fellowship to\
  \ India. \u201COh, he would be gone from me for a whole year! He too would leave\
  \ like the others\", I thought. I had to be on the compulsory youth service for\
  \ Nigeria's graduates, so I guessed he would not return for me... But he did...\
  \ We got married four months afterwards, in 2011! Then the unimaginable happened,\
  \ we were back together in India in 2012 for another year. How happy I was to go\
  \ on my first international trip!\n\"!ncred!ble !ndia\" they say. Indeed, India\
  \ is so incredible. We arrived India during the Independence celebrations of 2012.\
  \ From the Old to the New Delhi, to Mohali, Amristar, Agra, Wagah, Hyderabad, Lucknow,\
  \ Varanasi and Pune, we travelled together either for leisure or while he was attending\
  \ scientific meetings. The tea stalls, the sweet shops, the fruit shakes, I connected\
  \ to India.\nAs a pure and applied psychologist, I undertook a 3-month cultural\
  \ exchange programme at the SarangLok Centre, Mohali, Punjab where I learnt the\
  \ folklore dances: bhangara and giddha, while I taught them the traditional Yoruba\
  \ \"bata\" dance and folklore songs. I enjoyed the hospitality of the good people\
  \ of India. I learnt to speak basic Hindi. I also enjoyed the taste and aroma of\
  \ south and north cuisines of chappatti, parantha, idli, pakora, panipuri, pav bhaji,\
  \ garam chai; the \"namaste's\" and \"aap kese ho's\". In Hyderabad, I had a professional\
  \ training in organisational psychology with the Directive Communication Psychology\
  \ International. I became a cross-cultural psychologist!\nI did not have to miss\
  \ Nigeria food so much. There were okro, spinach, rice: but wasn\u2019t palm oil\
  \ nor yam, neither was there gaari and our type of beans\u2026 added to which eating\
  \ of beef is forbidden. But while living in Hyderabad, we had access to sea foods,\
  \ and I learnt to prepare many traditional foods of India. I fell in love with the\
  \ tricycles and the rickshaws. The sight of old models of Peugeot cars used by government\
  \ functionaries was amazing. I loved the \u201Csaris\u201D and \u201Clehengas\u201D\
  \ and the colourful bangles for married women. The cultural diversity was indeed\
  \ fascinating.\nEver since, my love for travel became renewed; especially to non-English\
  \ speaking countries. Now we are living in Argentina, another lovely country, where\
  \ we speak Spanish. We meet people from many countries of the world. I have only\
  \ met very few visitors from India, but when I do, it makes me wish for an opportunity\
  \ to visit India again. I only take solace in the fact that I am still in touch\
  \ with our many friends in India.\n\u201C!ncred!ble !ndia\u201D, my first love."
