Text: "The northern, New South Wales wind carries with it the blessings of contentment,\
  \ peace of mind, and openness.  Here, I saw my first whale, my first turtle, my\
  \ first goanna.  Here, I slept in teepees and wagons, and I learned to surf for\
  \ the first time.  Byron helped to mend my broken heart, and Byron gave me the courage\
  \ to dive into a love that would eclipse everything else.  Byron filled my being\
  \ with gratitude, nourished me and pushed me to grow.  Yet, despite all that I gained\
  \ from these visits, my first experience with its sacred origins did not present\
  \ itself until later - on an impulsive holiday, at sunrise, along the most Easterly\
  \ point of the Australian mainland. \n\nIt was the witching hour on Monday, July\
  \ 18, 2017 - 3:33 am glared hauntingly at me.  Briefly, I burrowed beneath the starched\
  \ sheets at the Airbnb in Suffolk Park worried about whether I\u2019d angered the\
  \ spirits before fumbling with the nightlight. I hugged my knees into my chin and\
  \ endeavoured to quiet my mind.  Even in the winter, people flock to the lighthouse\
  \ to bear witness to the morning sun.  Today was my last opportunity.  Although\
  \ Sam had had to return to Brisbane for work, he\u2019d extended my stay, booking\
  \ this bungalow just so that I could experience the sun break the horizon at 6:36\
  \ am.  I lingered for a moment before resolving to comb the bends of Cape Byron\
  \ in the dark. \n\nI was the only car there when I arrived, and apart from a lone\
  \ photographer and his tripod positioned at the base of the hill, I was the only\
  \ human present.  The sky was blanketed with stars; the Milky Way gleamed above\
  \ me.  And on the horizon, a deep lavender crept into the sky.  The iconic lighthouse\
  \ beamed out into the ocean and back into Arakwal forest - its navigation lights\
  \ illuminating the splendour of this place.  It all felt otherworldly. The sound\
  \ of Pacific swells enveloped me.  A bat swooped overhead and the bush was filled\
  \ with the quiet chatter of birds. There, as lavender melted into fire, I danced\
  \ - my arms open, the wind rinsing through my hair as I twirled beside the National\
  \ Park signage.\n\nTo put all of this into perspective, I must pay homage to the\
  \ Aboriginal people, the oldest continuing culture on Earth.  Byron Bay is home\
  \ to the Arakwal of the Bundjalung nation and it is known by its traditional custodians\
  \ as Cavanbah - which means meeting place.  Here, people from all over the Bundjalung\
  \ territory would gather in ceremony, and initiations were held in the very place\
  \ that I stood; initiation ceremonies that included corroborees - dancing circles.\
  \  There - at Walgun - they performed these sacred rituals - for 22,000 years until\
  \ it was levelled in 1899 to erect the lighthouse.  \n\nThe morning of July 18th,\
  \ I was deeply connected to the First People, to the many that had been there before\
  \ me. Though I didn\u2019t know any of this history at the time, that ancient presence\
  \ filled my being, reaching through me as I danced to the music of the ocean.  \n\
  \nApproximately 1.5 miles offshore, the outcrop teems with wildlife. According to\
  \ the Dreamtime or Arakwal understanding of life, this important habitat is known\
  \ to be the resting place of Nguthungulli, father of the world, creator of land,\
  \ plants, animals, and water.\n\nWith every breath, the sky\u2019s colours evolved.\
  \  A white-bellied sea eagle circled above, stretching his two-toned wings against\
  \ the wind, and a pod of dolphins emerged in the waves.  These animals are the Arakwal\u2019\
  s totems. The energy of their people permeated my spirit.  Finally, I began to understand\
  \ what it meant when people explained that  the world is their canvas; the land,\
  \ the animals, the water are their stories.\n\nAs the sun began to tease the horizon,\
  \ whales began to appear, and when the radiant sphere of fire presented itself,\
  \ it seemed to signal the official commencement of ceremony.  Humpbacks leapt in\
  \ threes and fours to the left and right of the sun in unison.  Tangerine faded\
  \ into turquoise.\n\nMaybe Nguthungulli had orchestrated this just for me, this\
  \ profound awareness of the universe that triggered feelings too deep and mysterious\
  \ for words."
