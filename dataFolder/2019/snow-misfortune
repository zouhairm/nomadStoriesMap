Text: "Two girls dragged themselves into the cold night. People said it was supposed\
  \ to be warmer already on March 16th 2018, but what the two humans witnessed on\
  \ the street of muted Gelsenkirchen was the pouring of snow. White, icy snow. It\
  \ was me and my friend from home, Hana, being lost amidst the first experience of\
  \ winter\u2019s last breaths. \n\nAs a person who grew up in a tropical country,\
  \ the coldest I\u2019ve ever felt was only as far as the slope of Javanese mountain.\
  \ Then there we were at night freezing as frozen bratwurst, figuring out which way\
  \ we came from and hopping three times on the wrong tram, on the very first day\
  \ of our arrival as exchange students in Germany. \n\nWhile my face and scalp started\
  \ to numb, I recalled three hours ago outside a phone service store where both of\
  \ us squealed in joy at the sight of snow. We just bought our SIM card before the\
  \ surprise of a first-time. The pavement was soaked a little and we were gleeful\
  \ on it, recording snowflakes or what not. It was 6 p.m. and time for every shop\
  \ to close. \n\n3 hours after that, I rode the last tram ride for that night, positive\
  \ then it was the one heading to our dorm. I could only imagine what would happen\
  \ if we did not push ourselves to have courage and talk to one of (not many) passers-by\
  \ in our broken German and nervous hand gestures. Despite our unfamiliar faces,\
  \ people were still so nice answering and sympathizing of what we went through.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWould be funny if we make it to the newspaper headline.\u201D And we\
  \ both laughed that laugh. The one that implicitly means \u201CIt\u2019s funny now,\
  \ won\u2019t be funny later if it happens for real\u201D.\n\nWhen the tram stopped,\
  \ we hopped off and prayed that it was our stop. It was a little past 9 p.m. when\
  \ we scanned our surroundings with tired eyes. \n\u201CLook! This is it!\u201D Hana\
  \ exclaimed. We both screeched and sprinted the sidewalk\u2019s sharp turn. And\
  \ there it was our building dorm standing in its glory. \n\nYou can imagine the\
  \ rest of that night ending happily according to this. What is interesting though,\
  \ is what happened the morning after. \n\nSo we agreed on sharing Hana's room as\
  \ a first night in our flat regarding the unfamiliarity issue. Her voice calling\
  \ me was what woke me up from slumber. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s snowing again. Much prettier\
  \ than last night.\u201D She was right. It was a beautiful morning waking up to\
  \ winter. The gloomy morning light appealed to us and the silence was whimpering\
  \ our names. We hurried outside with minimum clothing with our smartphones, ready\
  \ to shoot some actions. \n\n\u201CI\u2019m going to take my camera for a sec.\u201D\
  \ I told her in the middle of our photoshoot. Seconds later I was standing in front\
  \ of our flat door realizing there was a keyhole and no door handle. Right, the\
  \ doors here are unlike Jakarta's door. But we didn\u2019t know that before and\
  \ we didn\u2019t bring our keys for that matter. Oh yes, have we locked ourselves\
  \ out. \n\nAfter stages of frantic and finally giving in to whatever fate awaited,\
  \ we crashed at our fellow exchange program friends\u2019 flat. Sitting in their\
  \ kitchen with a cup of warm milk in hand. Then one of them called out to us, showing\
  \ a social media post that turned out to be the dorm community account\u2019s. The\
  \ post summed up to this; there are two new exchange students locked out of their\
  \ apartment, does anyone know what to do in this situation? \n\nI couldn\u2019t\
  \ do anything but laugh. Embarrassed. \n\n\u201CWhy is it always when we see snow?\u201D\
  \ Hana whined. I didn\u2019t know why. It could be coincidental or not. It could\
  \ be the nature telling us not to lose our guard at the presence of superficial\
  \ beauty. Or it could be us ridiculing ourselves. Whatever it was, after the whole\
  \ accomplished semester, after amazing places I\u2019ve been to, and all the first-times\
  \ I\u2019ve had, the snow misfortune is still the first story I tell to everyone\
  \ if they ask about an interesting something while I was in Germany."
