Text: "I looked down at the grit covering my bare arms and legs. Road dirt mixed with\
  \ sweat and sunscreen to create a grimy film on every surface. Despite pedaling\
  \ at a constant speed, a fly had landed on my hand, hitchhiking like a gull on a\
  \ water buffalo. It wasn\u2019t the first time I wondered what we were doing out\
  \ here.  \n\nWe were on the road between Hue and Lang Co, the first of a 10-day,\
  \ 400-mile cycling journey through central Vietnam, sweatier than we had ever imagined,\
  \ hungry, and thirsty. We had settled in to a sustainable pace, but we needed a\
  \ rest and were timid and unsure about where to stop. \n\nEvery Vietnamese home\
  \ along the way masqueraded as a caf\xE9, with a sign out front lauding local specialties.\
  \ Our American sensibilities told us to look for customers and we would be welcomed.\
  \ Groups of kids playing or the proprietor napping in a hammock were not what we\
  \ expected, and our misguided cultural instincts had brought us to near desperation\
  \ for a break. \n\nAfter a stretch of miles with only the ocean on our left and\
  \ rice paddies and mountains on our right, we reached a major intersection with\
  \ a cluster of parked motorbikes and sounds of lively conversation. We pulled over,\
  \ took off our helmets and hoped for the best. Chris, six-foot-two with pale white\
  \ skin, dripping with sweat, walked in first. Groups of locals, young and old, were\
  \ engrossed in card games at multiple tables. The small crowd of people shushed\
  \ and gaped at us curiously. Then they motioned to us to sit down. \n\nOver the\
  \ coming days, we would grow used to this reaction. \n\nThe space was open air,\
  \ covered with a corrugated tin overhang. The low plastic tables had pink checkered\
  \ tablecloths dotted with yellow flowers. Chris sat down, pulling his knees nearly\
  \ up to his chest on one of the tiny stools. We saw a stock of flatware and plates\
  \ enough to serve fifty, yet none seemed to be in use. To our left was a table of\
  \ grandparents, observing and grinning at us, whispering to each other. Our every\
  \ move seemed of the utmost interest to them. \n\nAlthough we were ravenous, we\
  \ had no idea how to ask for food. In the few days we had been in Vietnam, we had\
  \ picked up only the order for the typical strong black coffee with sweetened condensed\
  \ milk, so we decided to start with that. In his best Vietnamese, Chris made an\
  \ attempt. \n\n\u201CCafe-su-da,\u201D he said, imitating the sing-songy way we\
  \ had heard it pronounced. The friendly woman taking care of us stared at him blankly.\
  \ \u201CKa-phe-soo-da,\u201D he said again, changing the emphasize slightly. She\
  \ looked as if he was a baby cooing gibberish. I mimed drinking, complete with my\
  \ pinky up. The woman called over to one of the card tables behind us to fetch a\
  \ young man. \n\n\u201CHello,\u201D he said, as timidly as we had felt entering\
  \ the place. \u201CYou want something to drink?\u201D \n\nWe tried again. \u201C\
  Ah, c\xE0 ph\xEA s\u1EEFa \u0111\xE1,\u201D the young man said, sounding the same\
  \ and yet completely different from our attempts. Whispers swept from table to table\
  \ as our order was shared among the patrons. Grandma giggled. That we had stopped\
  \ for refreshment seemed to surprise everyone. \n\nMinutes went by while we waited\
  \ for the for coffee to drip slowly into the glass below, grateful for the shade\
  \ but feeling self-conscious of the stares. Grandma inched her chair closer to our\
  \ table, grinning. We smiled back. She spoke to us in Vietnamese. We smiled, settling\
  \ on this as our only form of communication. She called over the young man again.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D he asked shyly, using the words as if trying\
  \ them out for the first time since elementary school. \n\nWe hesitated. \u201C\
  America,\u201D said Chris. It took no translation for Grandma, or anyone else to\
  \ understand. We tensed slightly, not knowing what the reaction might be to our\
  \ nationality. Grandma nodded, and after a moment, her grin returned. The card games\
  \ continued.\n\nWe finished our coffee, strapped on our helmets and waved goodbye.\
  \ We still had many miles to go."
