Text: "It was during 2014 I was still an university student where every year my family\
  \ would have our annual trip. That year we planned to visit Eastern Europe I had\
  \ all the picture in my mind. Ready to see the beauty of Charles Bridge, the romantic\
  \ atmosphere of Prague, Land of music and beauty of Austria. Those images got packed\
  \ in my mind ready to experience them myself.\nBut that dream was torn to pieces\
  \ when my older sister visa got rejected. \nThe only family member to got rejected.\
  \ \nSo to keep the spirit up mum suggested why don't we visit Turkey? As we've never\
  \ been there and for Thais we don't require travelling visa. I was not in the mood\
  \ for any research and keep my mouth shut. I went there not expecting anything.\
  \ Boy, I never been so wrong in my life. It was like Christmas everyday. Everyday!\
  \ The exotic mosque, the unforgettable balloons and scenario of Cappadocia, majestic\
  \ ancient ruines and never felt more betryal from food. I remembered this exactly\
  \ moment where I had this pinkish purple jelly. Usually from the look of the food\
  \ we can guess the flavours. I went full dessert mode, expecting to taste the sweet\
  \ and sour flavours bursting in my mouth. \nBut it turns out to be radish jelly.\n\
  This was only an example of a meal. After a week in Turkey I started to develop\
  \ a trust issue for food.\n\nDespite my feeling of betrayal for food- don't get\
  \ me wrong their food is amazing just don't expect that something looks like a dessert\
  \ will always be a dessert. Perhaps I didn't have any expectations or images in\
  \ my head nor did I do any research. Everything and every moment was fresh and new.\n\
  It was an unforgetable family trip"
