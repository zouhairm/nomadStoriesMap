Text: "Wazemmes Market in Lille\n\nLille is in the north of France and just 1h30 from\
  \ London on the Eurostar so it's easy for Londoners to get there for just a day\
  \ or a weekend. It is easy to reach from London but also from Paris, Brussels, Rotterdam\
  \ and Amsterdam. \n\nI invited my husband for a surprise birthday trip there and\
  \ I got him to discover some local specialities like the local vanilla waffles from\
  \ the best pastry shops (meert.fr) visit some beautiful museums like the newly refurbished\
  \ 'Mus\xE9e des Beaux Arts', the Citadelle park, the old city centre. \n\nAnd then\
  \ on the Sunday, we decided to visit the Market in this less affluent area of the\
  \ city called Wazemmes.  \n\nAs soon as we arrived, we could hear the market sellers\
  \ shout to attract customers, see the colours of the flowers sold there and we could\
  \ sense the vibrancy of the area. There were the traditional stands of fruits and\
  \ vegetables, cheese, meat and general food but also so many unexpected things like\
  \ cheap jewellery, underwear, burqas, batteries, north African food stands... \n\
  \nWe did not buy much but were really impressed by the multicultural, vibrant and\
  \ positive atmosphere of the market. There were a lot of terraces on the side for\
  \ people to enjoy a drink or some snacks. The permanent covered market was standing\
  \ in the middle of it but it wasn't so interesting as it was maybe too conventional.\
  \ We walked a bit further and the streets, full of little restaurants and shops\
  \ from around the world, were also full of roadworks and therefore just for pedestrians.\
  \ \n\nPoorer areas are sometimes depicted in the media as more dangerous but they\
  \ are sometimes as well full of life, movement and surprising things so, in my opinion,\
  \ they might also be a bit more interesting.\n\nOf course, it is good to see the\
  \ usual tourist attractions and see what we usually like but 'sortir des sentiers\
  \ battus'* is good too, when we take new paths and see different things.  \n\n \n\
