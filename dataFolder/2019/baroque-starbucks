Text: "Trust me, you gotta see this Starbucks,\u201D Jodie said, pulling me by the\
  \ sunburned arm.\n\t\u201CStarbucks. In Paris.\u201D \nI allowed my college chum\
  \ turned Air Force First Lieutenant to usher me inside without taking an ironic\
  \ photo. After a 10- hour flight in coach from Chicago to France I was too tired\
  \ to argue and queued up to a shuffling line of hairy legs, sandals and sticky skin.\n\
  \u201CWhat am I gonna order...\u201D She put a nail bitten finger up to her lips\
  \ beaded with sweat. Her blue eyes squinted up at the menu. I rubbed away the white\
  \ mark on my arm where her fingers gripped. \nJodie ordered an Americano, I ordered\
  \ fresh squeezed orange juice. We waited longer than a drive-thru minute and passed\
  \ the time guessing where other patrons came from. \u201CAmerican,\u201D Jodie whispered\
  \ in my ear, pointing at the feet of a couple perusing Starbucks PARIS mugs. \u201C\
  Only Americans wear white socks.\u201D\nMy cup slid across the counter to my waiting\
  \ hand, like George McFly ordering a milk. Chocolate. \nThey misspelled my name,\
  \ to my delight. \u201CMirabelle\u201D, in black crayon was scrawled on my cup,\
  \ spelled like the name of a yellow plum harvested from the Loire Valley and crushed\
  \ into jam or fermented into wine. \n\u201CWhere do we sit?\u201D I zig-zagged through\
  \ the sipping crowd.\n\u201CUpstairs,\u201D Jodie said. \u201CIt\u2019s like Versailles.\u201D\
  \nChandeliers dripped with crystal tears and dull but blinding yellow light bulbs\
  \ hung from the corners. Ceiling paintings of frolicking cherubs and roses were\
  \ framed by dark paneling and accented by gold leaf. Veiny marble pillars topped\
  \ with Corinthian leaf columns supported their height and weight. \nHuge mirrors\
  \ reflected Baroque Starbucks\u2019 full capacity. Every seat was taken, every outlet\
  \ was powering a laptop or phone.\nWe sat outside on the patio beside a potted tree,\
  \ the only seat available. \nAn elderly woman at the table next to us slowly raised\
  \ the cup to her lips as if it was filled with wet sand. She gulped and coughed,\
  \ spitting out her coffee.\n\u201CAre you alright?\u201D I asked in English, not\
  \ knowing how to say it in French.\n\u201CI\u2019m fine,\u201D She answered in a\
  \ heavy French accent, dabbing her hooded eyes and lined mouth with a napkin. \u201C\
  When you are older your throat gets drier. Coffee is very acidic.\u201D\nJodie handed\
  \ her water.\n\u201CThank you.\u201D She took a small sip. \u201CCould you reach\
  \ into the pocket of my wheelchair?\u201D She asked after rifling through her cardigan.\
  \ \u201CI need my cough drops.\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s a beautiful building, no?\u201D\
  \ She popped a yellow piece of candy from the carton into her mouth. \n\u201CIt\
  \ is, actually. Kind of surprising for a Starbucks.\u201D\n\u201CThis used to be\
  \ a department store. I would shop here for material. I made my own dresses.\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CWell, the French are known as being fashionable,\u201D I said, smiling.\n\
  \u201CI am. I was.\u201D She tucked white wispy hair behind her ears. \u201CI remember\
  \ when Starbucks came to France. Before I only saw it in America.\u201D\n\u201C\
  You\u2019ve visited America?\u201D\n\u201COh yes. Many times. My son lives there.\
  \ He is an engineer. Like his father. He built power plants in India.\u201D\n\u201C\
  That\u2019s impressive.\u201D\n\u201CI was impressive too.\u201D The corner of her\
  \ mouth barely curved upward. \u201CI was a molecular researcher. During the war\
  \ and afterwards. We were feminists before it was a word,\u201D She said, reading\
  \ our surprised expressions. \u201CIf we could do the work, why not?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Why not,\u201D we agreed. \n\u201CThis is my last day in Paris. I don\u2019t want\
  \ to leave but--\u201D She shrugged, pointed at her swollen legs. \u201CI am disabled.\
  \ I must be with my son.\u201D She lifted her empty cup. \u201CAnd now I am drinking\
  \ the same coffee we will have in America.\u201D\n \u201CI will miss my garden the\
  \ most. With my own hands I manicured it. I won a prize for my flowers. Purple,\
  \ yellow, pink blossoms\u2026\u201D\nA slender man in his sixties with salt and\
  \ pepper hair came out of the caf\xE9 and unlocked her wheelchair. \u201CPret a\
  \ partir?\u201D\n\u201CNon. Mais oui.\u201D \nHe lifted her limp and heavy body\
  \ into a waiting cab, probably the way she carried her son as a baby. She waved\
  \ goodbye and they sped away into honking traffic."
