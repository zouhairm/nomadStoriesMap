Text: "\u201CBeyond History: It Felt Like Home\u201D\n\n         I was not really\
  \ sure the true meaning of the word \u201Cgratitude\u201D until my one-month field\
  \ immersion in Nan Province, Thailand.\n\n         I am a Cambodian citizen who\
  \ is currently on a scholarship, majoring Global Studies and Social Entrepreneurship\
  \ in Thammasat University, Thailand. During my freshman year, my team and I as community\
  \ researchers, had to immerse in Thai community, particularly, Pua District in the\
  \ northern part of Thailand. Our mission was to study about people\u2019s ways of\
  \ living, origin, culture, and community development. \n\n         I could not describe\
  \ all of my feelings at that moment; however, I was certain that there was one feeling\
  \ kept hanging onto me since I first stepped my feet on Thailand. It was a fear.\
  \ A fear of being criticized, ridiculed, abhorred, and unwelcome just because I\
  \ am a Cambodian.\nCambodia and Thailand have shared a long complex history together,\
  \ including a war of culture, a war of boundaries, and, etc. I always felt apprehensive\
  \ that I would be bullied and left out since I was an outlier; nevertheless, when\
  \ I arrived there, the atmosphere has changed by just simple things: smile, respect,\
  \ open-mindedness, flexibility, willingness to explore, and the desire to contribute.\n\
  \n          My team was hosted by the family of the community\u2019s headman, and\
  \ when I reached there, it was so awkward and frightening for me because I could\
  \ not speak or understand Thai language. I was the only Cambodian in the family,\
  \ and communication became a real challenge for me because my host family did not\
  \ speak either English or my language. Gratefully, I had my friends translating\
  \ for me so that I could indirectly engage in the conversation.\n\n          Even\
  \ though I could not communicate with my host family or the villagers, I did not\
  \ let this obstacle to impede me from cultivating a strong connection with the local\
  \ people. To win the heart of the community people, I started creating a good relationship\
  \ with the kids with did not speak Thai, English, or Khmer, but their ethnic language.\
  \ Every day, I hung out with them. Sometimes, I spent my days teaching basic English\
  \ to them and played with them. Days by days, many kids started to like me and kept\
  \ coming to find me. Many villagers who came to hang out at my host family\u2019\
  s house excitedly admired how I could make such a good relationship with the kids\
  \ when we did not even speak the same language.\n\n          Starting from that\
  \ moment, many villagers invited me and others to join different community activities,\
  \ for example, the aerobic dance every evening, a campaign to raise awareness against\
  \ malaria, the dance show in the event to raise awareness against drugs, and the\
  \ English camp for the high school students. I became more assured and cozy when\
  \ many local people smiled at me. Most importantly, my host parents tried to make\
  \ me feel inclusive in the family by always bringing me out to different places.\
  \ It was heart-touching when my host mom said, \u201CKimleang, I love you equally\
  \ just like I love your other Thai friends. Even though you are Khmin (a historical\
  \ term people from Nan called Cambodian people), I love you like my daughter; you\
  \ are pure and genuine.\u201D\n\n          I was crying with happiness when I heard\
  \ those words because my mission was to study about the community development, but\
  \ I have never realized there are people loving me from their heart. Silverware\
  \ is the identity of their community because they make living by creating silver\
  \ jewelry to sell. To keep their spirit of their community within me, my host parents\
  \ designed a silverware ring for me to wear, and I never took it off until now.\
  \ Wearing this ring makes me feel that their hearts are close to me, and from all\
  \ of those memories, I realized that the best gift I have ever received from them\
  \ is the beauty of empathy towards me. It is something that I must be grateful for\
  \ because their empathy brought me a sense of home, which helped me to numb my fear\
  \ of not being accepted."
