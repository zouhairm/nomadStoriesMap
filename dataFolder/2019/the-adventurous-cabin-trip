Text: "My first cabin trip in Norway was really spontaneous and therefore totally\
  \ unprepared. 4 girls alone, on tour, without knowing how to get there, what we\
  \ need, what we can expect, if we can find the cabin, how to make a fire or if we\
  \ survive! We didn't have a key, a map, a torch or enough food and drink and our\
  \ clothes weren't thick enough.\n\nWe literally woke up and decided to go there.\
  \ We took the bus as close as possible to the cabin, but still 20 kilometers away\
  \ from the final destination. Unfortunately, during the weekend, the school bus,\
  \ which drives closer to the cabin doesn't drive! Google Maps said we have to walk\
  \ 4 to 5 hours, hill upwards and it already started to get dark. But we still thought\
  \ let's try!  \n\nOn our bus journey we didn't hold this for the best idea any more,\
  \ so we started to contact all the other groups signed up for the cabin for this\
  \ weekend. We were lucky, one of the groups wrote us instantly and told us they\
  \ have a big car and we could fit in there, of course, we accepted thankfully.\n\
  Everything turned out to be good, we set up a location and a time and then we waited\
  \ for them. When they arrived we put 3 people in the first row, 4 people in the\
  \ second row and 2 people in the boot of the car. We basically hitchhiked without\
  \ any second thought or safety aspects like seat belts or anything. It was not really\
  \ comfortable but it was so much better than walking all the way! These guys were\
  \ totally our heroes, we would have died without them.\n\nFirst, we all thought\
  \ the cabin trip sounds a bit suspect, due to the too cheap price and all the included\
  \ things. On our first night we had to dress up as Vikings, but all the provided\
  \ materials where a garbage bag and aluminum foil. We played a typical Norwegian\
  \ drinking game with self-made Sangria, we had to sing Norwegian songs and in case\
  \ of misbehavior we were punished with more drinking or eating disgusting things.\n\
  \nOn the second day we did some hiking over a frozen lake or cross country skiing\
  \ and on the second night we had a big bonfire and a sacrifice, we were all a bit\
  \ scared of that, but fortunately, we only had to sacrifice a piece of paper with\
  \ a drawing of things we love. When it was our turn to sacrifice, we should tell\
  \ the others a little explanation of why we made this drawing. This was a really\
  \ nice gesture.\n\nAll in all, it was a very good weekend, it was great fun, we\
  \ had a great time with very nice people and definitely a rememberable time with\
  \ a lot of new expresses and good experiences. You always should leap into the unknown,\
  \ get rid of your fears, try something new and maybe you will be surprised about\
  \ the outcome, just like me. Everything will be fine!"
