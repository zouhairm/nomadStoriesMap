Text: "Multiple K\u2019s, 14 days, 3 friends, 1 car\u2026\nWho knew we would have\
  \ come so far\nFrom wee 9-year old detectives, Potter-heads, tree-dwellers and much,\
  \ much, more\nTo high school and university students preparing for what the world\
  \ has in-store\nBefore being scattered across New Zealand and the UK\nTo gain life\
  \ adventures; what more can I say!\n\nFinally reunited on a whim to discover our\
  \ homeland\nEmbarking on a journey with a bit of soul searching on hand\nLiving\
  \ a minimalist life in an old-school van\nTravelling the northern roads without\
  \ a set plan\nDetoxing from a generation wired with technology\nGoodbye Social Media,\
  \ Kia Ora Autonomy!!\n\nWaking every morning to the warmth of M\u0101ui\u2019s sun\n\
  Spreading from the tips-of-our-toes to the bobs-of-our-buns\nHearing the soothing\
  \ waves rolling upon the golden sand\nCreating musical notes as it whispers to the\
  \ land\nAn idyllic atmosphere enlivened with birds singing in glee\nCalling us to\
  \ swim in Tangaroa\u2019s sea\n\nA \u201CMust-See\u201D visit to Cape R\u0113inga\
  \ in our jandals\nWhat a sight to behold! Now that\u2019s hard to handle\nThe tidal\
  \ race between wild roaring waves\nFrom Tasman Sea and Pacific Ocean trying to behave\n\
  Underneath the weathered beauty of an ancient P\u014Dhutukawa tree\nIts pakiaka\
  \ (roots) still flourishing, guiding wairua (spirits) as they leap into the sea\n\
  \nBut our days were not always filled with such bliss\nUnexpected events, oh! Let\
  \ us reminisce\nForming comradeship with fellow freedom campers\nOver campground\
  \ owners bidding us to scamper\nOr arriving to new towns with no destined carpark\n\
  Leading to sneaky sleeping spots as soon as the sky fell dark\n\nThe oscillating\
  \ hum of cicadas sounding their alarm\nVibrating in the background, warning of harm\n\
  The adrenaline, the fear, the never-ending thought\n\u201CWhat if, what if, we all\
  \ got caught??\u201D\nSuch law-abiding citizens that we were\nKept on kruzn\u2019\
  \ -- \u201CBetter than the Popos\u201D we concurred\n\nThere were days when summer\
  \ hid a-way\nBringing seasonal surprises each day\nOur senses never had a lull\n\
  Thunderous clouds reverberating around our skull\nThe smell of rain as it approached\n\
  The melodic drumming as it encroached\n\nHeavier. Lighter. Directional as the wind\
  \ joined in\nNot embracing it, now that\u2019s a sin!\nThe pearl-like string of\
  \ water droplets\nCatching our eyes like Whittaker\u2019s chocolates\nDraping around\
  \ New Zealand\u2019s very best\nT\u0101ne Mahuta, the god of the forest\n\nThe taste\
  \ of moisture in the air\nThe earthy dampness around our ears\nThe dappled sunlight\
  \ filtering through lime green leaves\nCatching rays before midsummer night\u2019\
  s eve\nDancing between swaying treetops in the wind\nTrailing goosebumps along our\
  \ sun-kissed skin\n\nAnd a summer roadie around N-Zee\nWould not be complete without\
  \ L&P\nTo complement the classic \u201CFush & Chups\u201D\nThat\u2019s headed straight\
  \ down to our hips\nOur kai drowned in Wattie\u2019s tomato sauce,\nThe one and\
  \ only choice, of course!\n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like being brought back\
  \ here\nThan hearing a \u201CKia Ora\u201D, \u201CChur\u201D or a \u201CYeah Nah\
  \ Yeaah\u201D\nWhen yarning away to a M\u0101ori boy\nThat had given up the city\u2019\
  s joy\nFor a life nestled among wondrous creations\nLiving life according to his\
  \ own elations\n\nOur days spent crammed in a tiny van\nAlong with being super-stuck\
  \ in the sand\nWere well worth the most important things: \nSoaking in vibes that\
  \ pull at the heart strings\n& appreciating nature\u2019s effortless beauty\ngifted\
  \ by Papat\u016B\u0101nuku (Mother Earth) and Ranginui (Father Sky)\n\nAotearoa,\
  \ we can never say \u201CBye-bye\u201D\nYou\u2019re forever our t\u016Brangawaewae\n\
  A place where we feel rooted, empowered and connected\nNot only with the people\
  \ but a beautiful land well-respected\nOur foundation, our place, our homes\nBeing\
  \ a Kiwi: it\u2019s forever in our chromosomes!"
