Text: "\u201CMenyama Braya\u201D in \u201CKampung Bali\u201D, a Link to Home\n\nTravelling\
  \ and migration are not parts of Balinese traditions. However, Balinese communities\
  \ apparently are found in other parts of Indonesia even overseas, including China.\
  \ In the country, people of Balinese descent live in a place called \u201CKampung\
  \ Bali\u201D. How life goes in \u201CKampung Bali\u201D? \nVisiting the Giant Panda\
  \ country of China for ten days was quite overwhelming for me. The country itself\
  \ indeed belongs to Asian continent and certainly has some elements related to the\
  \ culture and tradition of my mother land, Bali Indonesia. Even so, I still found\
  \ difficulties to communicate to locals in Quanzhou, Fujian province, China. I experienced\
  \ as series of awkward moments, because most of the people the world\u2019s most\
  \ populous country do not speak English. I found the situation a bit hilarious yet\
  \ troublesome, when I had to use my mobile phone and gestures for asking where rest\
  \ room or how to get there. Well, it seems we may best be able to inhabit a place\
  \ where we are not faced with the additional challenges of having to be there, still,\
  \ it is kind of art of travelling, which is challenging the most.  \nSurrounded\
  \ by hills and located in Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China, Kampung Bali Nansan\
  \ or Nanshan community is occupied by 500 to 600 families. They were given the land\
  \ by the Chinese government to be used for building their own houses or flats. \
  \ Each family was given 120 square meters of land. As for those who cannot afford,\
  \ they were provided with apartments, covering an area of 90 square meters each\
  \ at affordable prices. Families classified as impoverished are even permitted to\
  \ occupy apartments for free. An adequate amount of pension money is also provided.\n\
  In 1961, 10 native Balinese together with 478 Chinese living overseas returned home\
  \ from Indonesia and lived in Quanzhou. They are married to local Chinese and resettled\
  \ in Kampung Bali. \n\u201CUling Cina ke Bali, langsung uling Bali buin melipetan\
  \ ke Cina \u201C (From China migrated to Bali. Then from Bali, back again to China),\
  \ \"said Chairman of Kampung Bali Nansan, Se Poh with a thick Buleleng accent.\n\
  In fact, the man was originally born in China. However, both of his parents continued\
  \ to communicate in Balinese after returning from migrating to the Island of Gods.\
  \ This factor makes him fluent in Balinese.\n\u201CMen ube masuk mare bise ngomong\
  \ Cina (When you enter school, you can only speak Mandarin), \"added Se Poh, who\
  \ still frequently visits his brothers in Bali, especially in Temukus, Buleleng.\
  \ According to Se Poh,  All locals in Kampung Bali are \"ex-migrants\" in Bali or\
  \ descendants (children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren) of the nomads.\n\
  Living overseas does not make Balinese in Nanshan forget their Balinese language,\
  \ nor the paradise island\u2019s tradition. Se Poh added further that the community\
  \ helped each other if there is a death or any village events. Living abroad will\
  \ not make them forget an old tradition of menyama braya or helping each other.\
  \ Once a year, they gather together to hold Balinese Legong dance and roast the\
  \ particular traditional  \u201Cbabi guling\u201C suckling pig dish. \nEfforts to\
  \ preserve Balinese elements are reflected on the Balinese architecture gate on\
  \ the entrance to the village of 15 thousand square meters. To provide a more Bali-like\
  \ atmosphere, Bali Indigenous Cultural Park covering an area of 5,000 square meters\
  \ is planned immediately to be constructed.\nNanshan community exceeded my expectation.\
  \ Finally, it feels like I have come home. With friendly locals, their hospitality\
  \ and intimacy, also their old traditional heritage, Kampung Bali Nanshan just feels\
  \ like home.\nBefore I flew back home, I got the chance to visit Quanzhou City dating\
  \ back to the 3rd century, flanked by Jinjiang and the Luoyang River and faced with\
  \ the Gulf of Quanzhou. It is also called Zayton. The locals are fond of Erythrina\
  \ flowers. They believe if the flowers bloom, life will prosper."
