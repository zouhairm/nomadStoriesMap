Text: "Water pours down from the night sky as if from a shower faucet. We're standing\
  \ on a narrow wooden balcony, arms outstretched with kitchen pots, collecting water\
  \ for tea. The plumbing in the house has broken down. Heavy drops fall into the\
  \ pots with a loud \u201Cding!\u201D, playing a hot Caribbean drum rhythm. My husband\
  \ and I are in Cartagena, Colombia.\n\nA month ago, when we told our friends that\
  \ we'd go on vacation to Colombia, they all reacted similarly: \"But why Colombia!?\"\
  \ as if it were some unknown and dangerous land. In a way, that used to be true,\
  \ until recently, when the Colombian government peacefully solved their problems.\n\
  \nNow Colombia is quite safe, and we decided to spend our vacation in a place we\u2019\
  d never been before.\nHaving learned some Spanish, we rented an apartment in the\
  \ old town of Cartagena, ready to dip into local life. And now here we are, in the\
  \ hot and humid Caribbean summer.\n\nThe local life starts early in the morning,\
  \ before the midday heat empties the narrow streets.\nIt starts with the loud calls\
  \ of the fruit vendor. \"Papaya! Papaya! Avocado!\" - this is how our alarm clock\
  \ will sound for the next seven days. The balcony doors in the living room have\
  \ only wooden shades and no glass, so we can clearly hear everything on the street.\
  \ As the fruit seller passes, pushing his cart full of colorful treasures, coffee\
  \ vendors come and occupy a shady place on the corner. A car stops. The driver has\
  \ decided to get a caffeine boost, so he buys a cup of coffee and chats with the\
  \ seller. His car blocks the street, immediately creating a traffic jam, but the\
  \ other drivers wait patiently. Perhaps they will be the next customers.\n\nRich,\
  \ aromatic Colombian coffee is sold everywhere. A thermos in one hand and a pack\
  \ of paper cups in the other, coffee vendors move around town all day long. We follow\
  \ in their footsteps, getting lost and finding our way through the maze of the cobblestone\
  \ streets lined with incredibly colorful houses. Balconies and windows everywhere\
  \ are covered with flowers. Cartagena is called the \"Walled City,\" but I'd rather\
  \ call it the \"City of Flowers.\"\n\nShortly before sunset, tourists and locals\
  \ alike head to the city wall. Here, the evening breeze comes to relieve the day's\
  \ heat. Walking at a relaxed pace, people enjoy Caribbean life. The tropical sun\
  \ sets quickly, like an orange dropping. The day is now over; the nightlife is just\
  \ beginning.\n\nOur host Juan has invited us for a night out. He loves his city\
  \ and wants to show us its best. As night falls, we head out to Getsemani, a bohemian\
  \ neighborhood that merely ten years ago was notorious for drug dealers and gang\
  \ fights. Juan recalls these times. But now Getsemani's streets at night are populated\
  \ with artists, musicians, and food vendors, attracting a crowd. We pass Plaza Trinidad\
  \ with its artisans\u2019 market. It\u2019s full of people chatting and dancing,\
  \ meeting with friends and having late dinner, eating cornbread baked right on the\
  \ spot.\n\nWe stop for a glass of beer at cafe Havana. The place is fully packed,\
  \ but we are lucky enough to get a tiny table to sit at. A live band is playing\
  \ salsa, and a couple next to us heads to the dance floor. They are both probably\
  \ in their seventies. I'd like to dance with such ease and passion when I'm seventy!\
  \ The rhythm of the salsa carries the dancers to another world, feet tapping, hearts\
  \ beating in sync.\n\nLater, as we head back home, a loud \"Chiva\" bus passes by,\
  \ full of partying  tourists.\n\nIt's well past midnight in Cartagena.\n\nThe city\
  \ lives openly, not hiding behind doors and curtains; street performers enthusiastically\
  \ dance to the accompaniment of drums, cars honk, hooves clatter on cobblestones,\
  \ guitars gently twang their strings, pairs dance and kiss on the ancient plazas.\n\
  \nTomorrow, alarm clocks will ring. Tomorrow will be another day, but right now,\
  \ the magic of the night reigns in its kingdom.\n\nI love you, city of flowers,\
  \ music, and openhearted people! You are not the land of the unknown anymore."
