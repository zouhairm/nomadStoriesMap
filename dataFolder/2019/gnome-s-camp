Text: "Summer in the southern hemisphere, a hole in the ozone layer above me, a vivid\
  \ red that is burning in my skin, not a shadow in sight, legs trembling and heavyweights\
  \ on our backs. We were in wild Patagonia heading to Cajon del Azul refuge in El\
  \ Bolson but in order to get there, we had to go through miles of vertical trails,\
  \ cypress woods, melted water falling from the icy crust on the peaks flowing in\
  \ thousands of forms while relentlessly carving stone throughout millennia. I was\
  \ with Guido, an old friend of mine. Along the way, we met a couple, we chat enthusiastically\
  \ until we run out of air. We reach the refuge after six hours. Our tongues were\
  \ swinging but ventually words start coming out once again, expressing the obvious\
  \ joy and gratefulness you feel when finishing a trail. We were delighted by the\
  \ sight, the blue rive, the cypress, the coihues, the araucarias and the lengas.\
  \ We settled in La Tronconada, we didn't have the budget to Cajon del Azul refuge\
  \ and we also refused to pay for enjoying nature.\nThe first thing we did was go\
  \ to the Azul river, I spread the rumours that the freezing water rejuvenates you\
  \ five years for each splash. After the third jump, it was clear that we didn't\
  \ turn into five years old but at the same time we didn't jump a fourth time for\
  \ the day, there was this fear of entering the realm of the unborn. The sun was\
  \ setting when we encounter a gnome at the top of the stone wall. It wasn't an actual\
  \ gnome but to this day I lack evidence to disprove his claim. He was a twenty year\
  \ old, small sized, skinny and wearing a red gnome hat while playing the guitar.\
  \ We connect instantly. When we try to find out what his name was, I'm a gnome he\
  \ reply always. We head to the camp with him.\nWe gather around the fire while we\
  \ learn more about him. He was in the mountain for a month already and as long as\
  \ we talk with him, the more we realize he wasn't as crazy as he seems. He had a\
  \ well-articulated answer for everything and a complex life philosophy we all shared\
  \ but he was the only brave man to apply it. I dissect the whole meaning of his\
  \ journey after a bottle of wine, a cosy fire and a cigarette. For him, our sensation\
  \ of self is a hoax, a temporary role and game we play with tacit consent, we are\
  \ willing to be hypnotized and defined by others, therefore limiting our freedom\
  \ by putting boundaries on us. The way he tries to defeat that was by playing another\
  \ role as far from society he could. We all get seduced by the idea, the fire and\
  \ the wine; so we all change our names too. Two girls named themselves Almond and\
  \ Caramel Nymph; and three boys were named Cloud, Rushes and Sparrow. I named myself\
  \ River, I want to be like water and depending on how I feel, I will be Blue River,\
  \ Calm River, Hazy River or Fierce River. \nWe called ourselves a tribe, we pulled\
  \ the camp out and we get as far from the trails as we could, we settled in a desolate\
  \ forest near a tiny hill we named the Almond Olympus, since she was the one that\
  \ spotted it. Each day we explore the unexplored, climb peaks, scare visitants,\
  \ exchange songs for food and search for hidden falls. Gnome proposed a baptism\
  \ ritual that consists in jumping through the highest stone tower through the water\
  \ column, in order to heal ourselves from fear. We define our own culture, our social\
  \ norms and invented a religion. \nDays passed and we didn't have enough food, we\
  \ didn't want to leave either, so we assemble the Raspberry's Squad to steal vegetables\
  \ in distant orchards. The warning signal was the sound of a fox. That way we extend\
  \ our stay in the Gnome's Camp but eventually, all comes to an end. After seven\
  \ days, we went back to civilization. We truely were five years old after all."
