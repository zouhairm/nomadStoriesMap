Text: "Two months ago I decided to move to Nairobi from Toronto, along with four other\
  \ strangers I recently met. After hearing about Nairobbery, I came along with a\
  \ very cautious attitude. Paranoia became a standard way of being. However, after\
  \ a few weeks here, I started to shed that paranoia and get comfortable. And one\
  \ ordinary day totally disrupted my comfort level.\n\n***\n\nMy friend and I had\
  \ just arrived home from work after our 20 minute walk only to hear a horrible tale:\
  \ our friend had been walking home in the evening sun and all of a sudden a Safe\
  \ Boda (Uber for motorcycles) driver whizzed past her and grabbed her purse. A move\
  \ that probably requires a bit of practice to perfect while being on a moving vehicle.\
  \ She screamed and yelled but no one came to her rescue, so with quick reasoning\
  \ she took matters in her own hands and pushed the driver away and ran home.\n\n\
  What\u2019s so special about this story? 1) Safe Boda, as the name implies, is a\
  \ company that vets their boda (motorcycle) drivers to ensure passenger safety.\
  \ 2) We were never told that safety was also concern in broad daylight. 3) This\
  \ incident happened just minutes from my house on the road that I take everyday\
  \ to work.\n\nWe spent the entire next week getting Ubers to work.\n\n***\n\nIt\
  \ had been a couple of weeks since that incident and my guard had lowered a bit\
  \ again. Other than some stares and occasional \u201Care you okays\u201D and \u201C\
  hi\u2019s\u201D, nothing too crazy had happened so far. Some of the house help ladies\
  \ had even gotten used to seeing me as they wait by the roadside for work to come\
  \ by. I had become old news\u200A\u2014\u200Apart of the daily grind.\n\nThey say\
  \ that just when you start to get comfortable is when misfortune strikes in Nairobi.\
  \ Thanks to my luck though, so far stories keep renewing my alertness. This new\
  \ story was by a local Kenyan man in his 30s. If you saw him, you couldn\u2019t\
  \ tell that he plays ice hockey at the national level as he\u2019s got the lean\
  \ Kenyan gene, very unlike the Canadian hockey players. When he heard about where\
  \ I lived, his first reaction was to warn me to be careful: Kibera, Africa\u2019\
  s largest slum is just past the main Ngong road near my home. I hadn\u2019t exactly\
  \ considered this when I chose my home for the next 11 months so I listened intently\
  \ to what he had to say.\n\nOn a hot summer night, Rob and his wife were walking\
  \ on Ngong road, near Ole Dume road, when they were suddenly surrounded by five\
  \ men with a gun. Their intention wasn\u2019t to kill, whether the gun was even\
  \ loaded, no one knows. But they took everything: phones, wallets, jewellery, everything.\
  \ They weren\u2019t even left with enough money to go back home. For context, it\
  \ would take me just nine minutes to walk to this intersection from my apartment.\n\
  \n\u201CRangi ya Thao\u201D is what we\u2019re called by the street kids\u200A\u2014\
  \u200Athe colour of a 1000 Shillings note ($10).\n\n***\n\nMy uneventful two months\
  \ have been filled with stories like these and it has made me realise that this\
  \ is the norm in many parts of the world, not just Africa. These stories leave many\
  \ of the locals unaffected but that wasn\u2019t the case with me. In fact, what\
  \ does surprise them is my experience in Toronto. They can\u2019t imagine living\
  \ a life where being cautious isn\u2019t the norm. A life where if you lost your\
  \ wallet, someone would find you and return it to you with cash intact. It\u2019\
  s made me question whether I am the one who has been living an abnormal life. Should\
  \ I not be surprised by these moments of adversity?\n\nFortunately or unfortunately,\
  \ I\u2019m getting there. I\u2019m learning to not feel dejected by the realities\
  \ of life in this city. Instead, I look up to the locals who don\u2019t let fear\
  \ get in the way of living. I have even stopped taking Ubers to work and instead\
  \ enjoy the 20 minute walk in the crisp morning air.\n\nI am starting to live like\
  \ a local."
