Text: "Thirty feet down, angel fish, seahorses, and schools of glassy sweepers passed\
  \ in front of my scuba mask. I pointed at what I thought was a rusty chain on the\
  \ ocean floor, but then it kicked up a sand cloud and whipped, eel-like, away from\
  \ us. Startled but elated, I returned the OK sign and a huge smile to my diving\
  \ buddy.\n\nI\u2019d come to Cozumel on a whim. Two weeks earlier, I watched sleet\
  \ pelt the windows of my apartment in New York City and felt similarly dreary inside,\
  \ newly single following the end of a ten-year relationship. I wanted to feel better,\
  \ happier, warmer right now, and traveling felt like the solution.\n\nNeither my\
  \ ex nor I had grown up in families that traveled much. When we began dating, I\
  \ had a job that frequently took me on the road to New Orleans, Los Angeles, and\
  \ London. I\u2019d always tack on a couple extra vacation days to explore for myself\
  \ and he\u2019d often join me. I began amassing points on an airline credit card\
  \ and planning future trips for us\u2014to the UK, Iceland, Spain, Israel. And yet,\
  \ a few months after we returned to New York from our honeymoon in Paris, he announced\
  \ he was \u201Cdone\u201D traveling by plane, saying it had become too dangerous.\
  \ I figured he would come around eventually. But time went by and the points started\
  \ expiring, so I spent them on travel magazine subscriptions instead.\n\nI was thumbing\
  \ through one of those magazines that sleety day when I turned to a story about\
  \ Cozumel where, coincidentally, my next-door neighbors (also friends), had recently\
  \ purchased a small condo, which they had offered to me several times. So without\
  \ thinking about it any further, I stood up, walked out my door, knocked on their\
  \ door, and asked if by any chance their place was available the week after next.\
  \ They excitedly said yes and immediately started loading my arms with Spanish phrasebooks,\
  \ maps, and DVDs of their newest hobby, scuba diving, hugely popular in Cozumel\
  \ because the Mesoamerican Reef System, the second largest in the world, is located\
  \ there.\n\nBack in my apartment, I jumped online and used every remaining airline\
  \ point I had to book the only first-class flight I\u2019d ever taken. Suddenly,\
  \ I had plans, a destination, something to look forward to\u2014and sadness was\
  \ a speck in my rear-view mirror.\n\nOnce in Cozumel I befriended Anika, the property\
  \ manager at my friends\u2019 condo. It was off-season, so she and I were the only\
  \ ones in the entire complex. An expat from Arizona who had recently gone through\
  \ her own difficult break-up, Anika was glad for my company. For the next week,\
  \ we buzzed around the island in her Jeep, visiting the Mayan ruins of San Gervasio,\
  \ passing mangrove forests, exploring Playa Bonita and Punta Sur Eco Beach Park,\
  \ shopping the local markets, and taking salsa lessons in el z\xF3calo (the town\
  \ square).\n\nAt dinner one evening, a friend of Anika\u2019s invited me to spend\
  \ a day at his dive shop with his best instructor at my service. Trying to continue\
  \ to embrace the new, I swallowed my Caribbean spiny lobster and raised my bottle\
  \ of Pac\xEDfico to accept. I momentarily put aside the fact that I am claustrophobic\
  \ and couldn\u2019t make it through a single dive video that my neighbors had loaned\
  \ me.\n\nFortunately, Anika agreed to dive with me, reducing my anxiety. I learned\
  \ to use the equipment in a pool first, then we started the real dive from shore,\
  \ gradually moving farther out. I was surprised at how easy it was to breathe on\
  \ my own, to descend and surface as I pleased, and to trust my partner.\n\nWhen\
  \ a relationship ends, it\u2019s hard to envision your new life. Diving in the Caribbean,\
  \ something I never imagined doing, delivered a spectrum of sights and colors like\
  \ nothing I\u2019d ever seen and that only became more astounding the farther I\
  \ went. It was like being given back a part of myself I didn\u2019t know I\u2019\
  d lost, and it gave me an idea of how I could be comfortable with all the unknowns\
  \ ahead."
