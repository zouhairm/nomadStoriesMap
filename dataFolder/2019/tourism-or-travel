Text: "Don\u2019t plan things down to the T, plans have a way of going awry and more\
  \ often than not it\u2019s for the best. Its good to have a plan as a rough guide\
  \ to help you begin. Have a direction and keep walking, the path will find you.\
  \ Besides there\u2019s contentment in being surprised in the best ways by life.\n\
  \nAlmost all my life I\u2019ve read and heard about travel, how it changes you.\
  \ How you must travel as far and as widely as possible. And then I embarked on a\
  \ journey. It began with my move to Dublin! Almost a year went on and I still hadnt\
  \ travelled. My first trip from Dublin was to Amsterdam and Belgium. And while it\
  \ was quite something, I was exhausted. And I couldn\u2019t get it, the hype about\
  \ traveling. Another year went by without much travel. And then came June 2018.\n\
  \nI spontaneously booked two more trips (Stuttgart and Switzerland) about two weeks\
  \ before my France trip! Haha best thing I ever did. \n\nSo I didn\u2019t start\
  \ out falling in love with travelling. I was left exhausted after Amsterdam, with\
  \ all the crowd and running around and spending too much without having the exact\
  \ kind of fun I imagined. \n\nSo back to June 2018, I take off for France. Visited\
  \ Paris! Aah Paris! It has a different kind of energy, don\u2019t let anyone\u2019\
  s opinions influence you, go visit Paris yourself and decide! I loved it, I ended\
  \ up walking around Paris for 16 km the first day itself and without actually realising\
  \ it, covered all the tourist attractions and so much more! (I\u2019m not a big\
  \ fan of going into places and standing in queues, etc, I admire the architecture\
  \ and vibe and move on). It was class, and I didn\u2019t realise I\u2019d covered\
  \ it all on foot, until I took a sunset cruise later than night and realised I had\
  \ done it all! Fabulous right?\n\nThe following weekend, I took off for stuttgart.\
  \ A quaint city with impeccable public transport. I loved it! I did things on my\
  \ own, which was amazing! So I\u2019d come a long way from being tired of travelling\
  \ to dreaming of my next destination.\n\nFast forward two weeks and I\u2019m off\
  \ to Switzerland, absolutely on my own! I land in Zurich! I had sky diving booked\
  \ in Interlaken. The most fun part was figuring out how to get from one place to\
  \ another, in all three countries.\n\nInterlaken took me by surprise, this little\
  \ town. I was surrounded by mountains, rivers, lakes and wildlife. I\u2019d found\
  \ my paradise. I avoided crowded areas like the plague. I liked people, but only\
  \ a few and ones like me who wanted nature and peace and maybe a conversation with\
  \ a complete stranger. During the sky dive I met thrill seeking, nature loving fellow\
  \ travellers!\n\nAfter the dive, I went for treks in the mountains, exploring waterfalls\
  \ and terrains as I went along. The next day was spent train hopping, going around\
  \ Switzerland! And hiking some more, just exploring. \n\nAnd then on my way to the\
  \ airport I realised I\u2019d fallen in love with travelling. I was planning my\
  \ next solo trip. Or any trip. I\u2019d fallen in love with my own company. I found\
  \ peace where I didn\u2019t expect to find it. \n\nSo here\u2019s my point. If you\
  \ travel somewhere and don\u2019t find it enticing enough, it\u2019s fine. I couldn\u2019\
  t see the hype around it either. It\u2019s about two things, your comfort zone and\
  \ your comfort zone. I know I said the same thing. First, it\u2019s your comfort\
  \ zone, it\u2019s very difficult leaving that comfort zone. The familiarity and\
  \ the security. The second is your comfort zone with respect to travelling. Find\
  \ what suits you best! And you\u2019ll find out it\u2019s all worth the hype. Try\
  \ a bit of it all and see what you like best, city hopping, crowded busy tourist\
  \ spots. And travel alone at least once doing a bit of all, be safe though! And\
  \ you\u2019ll find your kind of travel. Trust me. And even if you don\u2019t, you\u2019\
  ll know you don\u2019t like it and that\u2019s great cause then you can do what\
  \ you like!"
