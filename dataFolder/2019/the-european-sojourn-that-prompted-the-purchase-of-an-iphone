Text: "It was the summer of 2011. Having just completed a semester in Copenhagen,\
  \ I found the tulips, the top-knots, the continental breakfasts, the cycling, and\
  \ the country\u2019s progressive stance towards women, politics and climate change\
  \ - to be life-changing. But, perhaps tired of having to thaw-out my hands in warm\
  \ water for four months meant I wanted to spend the summer in warmer pastures. \n\
  \nSo, being cash-strapped and needing to stretch as much money as possible for two\
  \ weeks meant a cycling trying down the France/German border seemed a perfect way\
  \ to spend the summer. The plan seemed bullet-proof. I would cycle through beautiful\
  \ vineyards, freedom camp in a tent I borrowed from my cooky Danish friend, Hans,\
  \ and catch a flight in Cologne. It would be fine, I thought. What could possibly\
  \ go wrong, I thought.\n\nThe first week was nothing short of romantic. Hailing\
  \ from New Zealand, and having little respect for maps meant I thought I didn\u2019\
  t need to rely on technology to get me from A to B. Scary yes, but in practice,\
  \ the signage throughout the majestic Alsace Lorraine region meant I could navigate\
  \ myself easily. And locals were only too kind to offer help, even despite my terrible\
  \ French. \n\nI had also developed somewhat of an addiction to almond croissants\
  \ during this time - an addiction that still holds true today - which meant all\
  \ and every bakery I passed got to enjoy the fruits of my patronage. Why are French\
  \ croissants so much better than any croissant purchased outside the country, I\
  \ wonder? Is it the pastry? Is it the butter content? Or is it the combination of\
  \ being served something delightful by someone with a fabulous accent? But I digress.\
  \ \n\nSeven days in, and a belly full of wine, fresh raspberries and a country\u2019\
  s worth of croissants, it was time to venture across the border to Germany. Nothing\
  \ could break my stride at this point. Not what was to become a week\u2019s worth\
  \ of rain. Or that my ergonomic inflatable mattress had been punctured. Or my sudden\
  \ fear of bears and insects. It was the fact that I realised, halfway, that I had\
  \ completely miscalculated the geographical distance of the journey. My blip, as\
  \ it were, thanks to my disdain for technology at that point, would mean I would\
  \ have to cycle 100km per day to arrive on time for my flight. And so it was. \n\
  \nNeedless to say, I\u2019ve blocked out that last week. I remember making my flight,\
  \ slightly traumatised, with possible torn ligaments, but the achievement and the\
  \ life experience gained was all worthwhile. Sure, I couldn\u2019t stomach the thought\
  \ of getting on a bike for five years but it\u2019s 2019 and I now can't think of\
  \ an experience I'd like to repeat more."
