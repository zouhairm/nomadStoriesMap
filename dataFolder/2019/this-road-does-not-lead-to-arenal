Text: "Our silver rental car sank deeper into the quicksand-like mud; it was at that\
  \ very moment a little warning popped up on my Maps.me App.  I zoomed in to read:\
  \ \u201CEnd of Road. Do not continue! Only horses. Warning signs taken away.\u201D\
  \  The Costa Rican jungle had found its next sacrifice.  \n\nJust two days earlier\
  \ during our layover in Los Angeles, the three of us booked a four-wheel drive SUV.\
  \  However, when we arrived in Costa Rica, the car company gave us a two-wheel drive\
  \ sedan.  As we complained, the agent promised us the roads would be well maintained.\
  \  So we begrudgingly grabbed the keys and threw our bags in the car.\n\nWe were\
  \ in route to our hotel near La Fortuna, and I had found a rural road that would\
  \ save us over three hours.  There was a sweet smell of mysterious floras, mixed\
  \ with undertones of decaying leaves.  The air was heavy with mist and surprisingly\
  \ cool.  It was as if Mother Nature herself had set the Instagram filter to 100%\
  \ oasis.  Intermittent rain showers rolled through in opaque white sheets, and continued\
  \ like ghosts down the valley.  \n\nLeah broke our jungle trance with, \u201CI don\u2019\
  t think this road connects all the way to La Fortuna; nothing is showing up on my\
  \ Google Maps.\u201D  I quipped back, \u201CWell I can clearly see the route on\
  \ my offline map; maybe Google isn\u2019t up-to-date in this remote region of Costa\
  \ Rica.\u201D  Leah apprehensively stopped pushing the issue as Jess and I got back\
  \ to our mission: navigating the treacherous non-name jungle road.  The road got\
  \ increasingly narrower to compliment our tunnel vision, and steeper to match our\
  \ Alaskan-sized egos.  As the ground started to liquefy around us, I offered up\
  \ as solace, \u201CI thought this was the dry season\u201D.  Jess retorted, \u201C\
  Katie, I don\u2019t think there is a dry season in a cloud\u201D.  A wave of chagrin\
  \ washed over me; had I led us down the road of no return?    \n\nIn the fading\
  \ light, Jess and I saw movement through the mist-blurred windshield.  Up ahead\
  \ on the road was an individual on a motorbike, clad in all black rain gear with\
  \ neon green reflector strips.  As the bike stopped next to the car, Jess apprehensively\
  \ rolled down her window.  \n\nIt was a young woman, about our age.  \u201CWHAT\
  \ in the world are you doing out here?\u201D  We collectively stammered, \u201C\
  Making our way to the volcano.\u201D  \n\n\u201CThis road does not connect to Arenal.\u201D\
  \  \n\nHer name was Elliseth, and she grew up in this region of the Alajuela Province.\
  \  \n\nA beat up box truck came puttering around the corner.  Three men jumped out.\
  \  She introduced us to her father, brother, and husband.  Elliseth\u2019s father\
  \ pulled out a jar of what appeared to be moonshine, and offered it to us.  As we\
  \ all took a swig, everyone laughed as our faces involuntarily contorted; their\
  \ family\u2019s homemade tequila. \n\nThrough a mix of Spanish, English, and charades,\
  \ it was determined that Elliseth\u2019s husband would attempt to rally the rental\
  \ car back up the ravine.  We gathered behind the car, and collectively dug our\
  \ feet into the chocolatey slop.  Elliseth\u2019s husband put the car into low gear,\
  \ and expertly gave it a steady stream of gas.  We pushed, and the rear wheels squealed,\
  \ spraying us all with cold mud.  We pushed again.  The car lurched up and over\
  \ a large rock, but rolled back and fishtailed to the left; Elliseth\u2019s father\
  \ and I jump out of the way to avoid getting pinned.  But as if the jungle was finally\
  \ tired of toying with us, the tires grabbed onto some stable earth, and the car\
  \ eased forward; Elliseth\u2019s husband wrestled the car up and over the apex of\
  \ the hill.  The group burst out into cheers, hugging each other as if our team\
  \ had just won the World Cup.  \n\nI don\u2019t know what would have happened if\
  \ Elliseth and her family hadn\u2019t happened upon us at the exact moment we realized\
  \ our doomed fate.  However, the planned destination might not be what you are actually\
  \ yearning for.  On that day, through a series of insidious events, we found what\
  \ we really all desired; a local connection."
