Text: "A friend of mine, who got married with Vietnamese Girl, invited me to attend\
  \ his wedding party in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. As I got the invitation, I called\
  \ my friend in Vietnam to ask his help to accompany me when I stayed in Vietnam.\
  \ I just knew that he doesn\u2019t live in Ho Chi Minh City but a district city\
  \ nearby called Long Kh\xE1nh. He invited me to visit his hometown after the wedding\
  \ feast and I agreed with that.  \n\nOne day before the wedding day I flighted from\
  \ Jakarta to Ho Chi Minh City. I was so exciting to see how the wedding feast in\
  \ Vietnam was and also to visit my friend\u2019s hometown in Vietnam. I arrived\
  \ in the morning and I was picked up by the cousin of the groom. It was a little\
  \ bit adventure, my phone battery was empty and I didn\u2019t know the person before,\
  \ my last chat with him was that he will pick me up at the airport. I waited about\
  \ half an hour until suddenly he managed to know my appearance. After bringing me\
  \ to the hotel he invited me to eat some Vietnamese noodle, M\xEC Qu\u1EA3ng, it\
  \ is very delicious and fresh. \n\nAfter that I attend the ceremony before the wedding,\
  \ the mom of the bridegroom gave him six red baskets fill with different things\
  \ like fruits, flowers, moon cake, etc. The bridegroom and his friends receiving\
  \ these baskets and bring them to the bride\u2019s house. At the bride\u2019s house,\
  \ bridesmaids were waiting for us. Then we gave these baskets to the bridesmaid\
  \ and made an aisle for the bridegroom to go to the bride. Then we had a prayer\
  \ ritual in the bride\u2019s house before we went to the church for Holy Matrimony.\
  \ I was impressed by how simply this wedding compare to us in Indonesia, even the\
  \ parents of bridegroom go to the church using a motorbike taxi. \n\nThe wedding\
  \ feast was in the evening. We had dinner at round table, where several Vietnamese\
  \ cuisine was served. I\u2019m really enjoying the food. At the table I also learned\
  \ one important thing, the Vietnamese way of drinking, which was soon help me to\
  \ connect with the local. So before drink they say m\u1ED9t, hai, ba, v\xF4! (pronounced\
  \ mot, hi, bah, yo), which literally translate one, two, three, cheers!! The bride\
  \ and the groom were also going from table to table to drink beer with guests. \n\
  \nIn the very next day I went with my friend to his hometown. The journey was around\
  \ two hours by bus. He has a farm in his hometown, a hydroponic farm, from which\
  \ he gain his income by selling vegetables.  He invited his relatives and we had\
  \ a banquet for the dinner. He said, that it was to welcome me as a guest. I was\
  \ really touched at that time. The problem was, that I don\u2019t speak Vietnamese\
  \ and his relatives can\u2019t speak English either. But one thing that make us\
  \ connected, food and drink. We shared the food at the table. There were some meats\
  \ and shrimps and we wrap with fresh vegetables from the garden and dip it into\
  \ fish sauce, a traditional Vietnamese sauce. And last but not least it was accompanied\
  \ by traditional Vietnamese alcohol. The drink was made from fermented rice and\
  \ also banana. They used shot glass to drink. I just learn that they don\u2019t\
  \ allow our glass to be empty, so they will always refill our glass with a drink\
  \ during the meal. I invited them to do a cheers in Vietnamese and they are really\
  \ happy. One of the eldest also ask me to drink in one shot with him.\n\nAfter the\
  \ meal we sat to chill out. My friend told me that his relatives was impressed by\
  \ my ability to drink. I tried to introduce myself in Vietnamese and they were really\
  \ happy. Even though we didn\u2019t understand each other very much when we talked\
  \ but we share happiness during our meal. I really taste their friendliness during\
  \ the meal and after. It was wonderful experience that I will not forget, to eat,\
  \ to drink, and to connect with local people."
