Text: "Travelling to different places has always been my dream . But people often\
  \ end up travelling to different countries and forget about discovering their own\
  \ . I have never visited any other country till date , but my own heritage dosent\
  \ fail to surprise  me with it's warmth every time I discover a new journey of its\
  \ own .\n     I have visited 26 states till now out of the 29 states we bound by\
  \ . The journey which made me meet new people was my local train journey to my college\
  \ .\n     I know it's strange but that 1 hour travel journey to the same destination\
  \ everyday was a thrilling experience of its own . I met new people from every corner\
  \ of the city everyday . \n     Local trains in Mumbai pay no divide to the rich\
  \ or poor , I havr met a CEO of a company or a street vendor in the same hook .\
  \ The hustle of the city flows in this one compartment and you don't even need a\
  \ travel guide to explore this . \n     One compartment , one journey and one hour\
  \ is all you need to make a match and be one amongst the crowd . Many have also\
  \ found their love partners in this journey , for some it was like a second home\
  \ , some made friendships so strong as rock and a few unlike me made this their\
  \ escape destination . \n     These crowded trains didn't make me disgust about\
  \ it , it rather made me discover the beauty in adjustments . Space out for the\
  \ next station passenger needs place to stand , they never let you stand alone or\
  \ feel lonely , there is always one person who is eager to talk to you . \n    \
  \ They joy of being one in the crowd has it's meaning of its own . I have played\
  \ games , had life conversations , made new friends , became a shopaholic in this\
  \ one compartment.  \n      I call it my masti ka pittara which just means my favourite\
  \ box of fun . \n      This is how I made my local connection with my local train\
  \ , can't get more local , can it ?"
