Text: "Anyone who knows me (and now everyone who reads this) knows that I apply for\
  \ every free trip on the internet (and then some). You can call me foolish, silly,\
  \ naive, whatever...I don't really care but I know that one day I'm going to win.\
  \ I've also been seriously discontent with my profession of more years than I care\
  \ to admit. \n\nAlong comes this opportunity to travel and write. Write and travel.\
  \ Two of my absolute favorite things (throw in a museum and a good pignot noir and\
  \ my life is complete). A trip to Portugal, a place I've never been but so many\
  \ friends have filled instagram with, a place I'd love to go AND write about. Hmmm....travel\
  \ writing for a living? I've never considered it before but why not. And suddenly\
  \ my whole world opens, changes, expands, does flip flops and all but explodes at\
  \ the mere thought of it. \n\nI apply and, wait for it.....I actually win! Yep,\
  \ just like the little boy who planted a carrot seed (my secret hero) I always knew\
  \ I would (or it could or something like that). I can't wait to tell you all about\
  \ it but for now, I've got nails to paint, computers to recharge and some packing\
  \ to do. Stay tuned!"
