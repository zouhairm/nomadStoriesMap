Text: "I grew up on a garden full of vegetables that my grandmother looked after in\
  \ the Romanian countryside. We feasted on toast, butter, homemade strawberry and\
  \ cherry jams; aubergine salad, chicken soup, meatball soup, tripe soup, polenta,\
  \ fried pork, scrambled eggs and apple pies; a flurry of lamb and pork dishes that\
  \ my family cooked for Easter and Christmas. We drank my grandfather's red wine,\
  \ which he made and fermented in wooden barrels every autumn.\n\nI gave up traditional\
  \ food as I moved to the city, dieted as a teenager, travelled abroad, experienced\
  \ international cuisines and tried a raw-vegan lifestyle altogether. \n\nNevertheless,\
  \ it is impossible to resist my grandmother's food whenever I am home. Firstly,\
  \ because she takes feeding me seriously - saying \u201Cno\u201D is never an option.\
  \ Secondly, because my instincts crave it. No matter how hard I fight it, the thought\
  \ that her cooking is nearby or that a restaurant is serving the flavours I grew\
  \ up on stirs hereditary cellular memories that demand themselves relived. \nTherefore,\
  \ the trip I am sharing was driven by hunger \u2013 of authentic and traditional\
  \ flavours, of meeting the old and finding the new. One Saturday in January, far\
  \ from Romania, I ventured out in the cold for a meal, travelled from Brooklyn into\
  \ Manhattan, ferried past the Statue of Liberty and docked in Staten Island with\
  \ a healthy appetite, keen to discover what the buzz at an oft-in-the-news restaurant\
  \ was about. \n\nEnoteca Maria was booked out, fittingly for its reputation. The\
  \ restaurant hires \u201Cgrandmothers\u201D of different nationalities to cook their\
  \ own traditional food, delighting their guests and their senses. This is traditional\
  \ cuisine at its most raw - the \u201Cgrandmothers\u201D treat the kitchen like\
  \ their own and their guests like family. There is no partition between the dining\
  \ room and the kitchen. You can see your \u201Cgrandmother\u201D of the evening\
  \ making her way around the stoves; she can see her guests enjoying her food. The\
  \ recipes and ingredients are the ones they use at home and the dishes are plated\
  \ traditionally. There is no fusion spin on what arrives at the table - a boiled\
  \ lamb\u2019s head is served if the traditional dish demands it! Guests may or may\
  \ not Instagram the moment unfolding one borough away from Manhattan. Conversation\
  \ wins over screen time in this establishment. \n\nThe owner Joe Scaravella was\
  \ working behind the counter and offered me a seat at the bar. \"The best one, you\
  \ can see everything and have your privacy from here\u201D, friends of Enoteca said\
  \ later. The dining room was chatty and I talked to Joe throughout the evening,\
  \ sharing how I had learned about his restaurant  - him, how he had begun this journey.\
  \  \n\nEnoteca Maria started with nine Italian \u201Cgrandmothers\u201D cooking\
  \ \"the food that their mothers had prepared for them as children\". Now \u201C\
  grandmothers\u201D the world over take turns to cook in the kitchen and the recipe\
  \ works - Joe took bookings throughout the evening. The \u201Cgrandmother\u201D\
  \ of the night was Fatima from Turkey, so I dined on grilled octopus, with a side\
  \ of vegetables, several glasses of Pinot Grigio, and mouth-watering coffee ice\
  \ cream dipped in espresso for dessert. \n\nJudith and Gareth, a Hungarian-American\
  \ couple and friends of the restaurant, descended on Enoteca energised from the\
  \ Women\u2019s March . We had a genuine conversation, proof that the space broke\
  \ through culture and unfamiliarity and facilitated meaningful exchanges. \u201C\
  I am happy so many people made their voices heard today\u201D, Judith said, \u201C\
  what brings you here?\u201D\u2013 and I shared my story. \n\nDo the means to understand\
  \ one another and connect as people go through our stomachs? \n\nMy evening at Enoteca\
  \ Maria remains one of the most vivid culinary experiences I have ever enjoyed \u2013\
  \ thanks to the food and the stories we shared. That evening reminded me that food\
  \ is one of the original footprints of who we are as people. It has the ingredients\
  \ to unite us. Great restaurants are community and conversation houses. The folks\
  \ at Enoteca in Staten Island are like family."
