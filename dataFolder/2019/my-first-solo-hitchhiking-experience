Text: "I\u2019m in Vilnius, the pretty capital of Lithuania, and I want to try a first-time\
  \ life experience. Hitchhiking solo trip all the way to Riga. My plan is to wake\
  \ up early in the morning in order to have as many hours of lights as possible.\
  \ I finally get up at 10\u200A\u2014\u200Anot an impressive result. The sky is completely\
  \ free of clouds and the temperature around five degrees, definitely a perfect a\
  \ day to hitchhike to Riga. I\u2019ve heard that good spots from where is possible\
  \ to start are on the road close to the beginning of the highway. Once I\u2019ve\
  \ reached the road my feelings start to be a little bit confusing, but also clear\
  \ at the same time: on one side I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve done the right\
  \ choice and on the other side I am able to consider myself sure of only one thing:\
  \ the uncertainties that I am going to afford during the trip. There will be no\
  \ timetable, no idea if the first car is going directly to Riga, and no idea where\
  \ I'll be dropped.\nI start hitchhiking at 11.30 with the warmth of the sun on my\
  \ face, and a big cardboard in my hands. After an hour and a half, nobody has picked\
  \ me up yet. The cars don\u2019t go too fast because there are quite a lot of traffic\
  \ lights. It happens, finally, that a couple, three months old baby and a lot of\
  \ bicycles on the back, stop: they are going to Ukmerge, a small village only 70\
  \ kilometres north from Vilnius. It\u2019s the first lift for me, and I feel very\
  \ excited. The challenge is accepted. An hour and a half later and a potatoes pancake\
  \ in my stomach, I realize that along Lithuanian highway there aren\u2019t gas stations.\
  \ The couple leaves me just after Ukmerge, in the middle of nowhere. I am on a straight\
  \ line which literally cut the forest. I try to show my cardboard animatedly to\
  \ everyone, especially to the trucks, because I know they do longer ways. It\u2019\
  s getting colder and darker and after almost an hour I am still there, sincerely\
  \ scared to pass the night in the forest. At one moment I decide to write down the\
  \ name of Panevezys, a smaller Lithuanian city closer to the border with Latvia.\
  \ I see a truck slowing down and I start running toward the driver. The answer is\
  \ positive, and I am definitely relieved. The view from the truck gives me a sense\
  \ of power and security. I immediately decide to tell the guy, who unfortunately\
  \ doesn\u2019t speak English, to leave me at the next gas station. Once there, it\u2019\
  s already dark but I start to feel more comfortable and almost at home at the sight\
  \ of trucks, lights, and Hesburger, a Finnish fast food chain, definitely not the\
  \ best restaurant of my life. I immediately see a truck driver, but unfortunately,\
  \ he is staying there for the night. His way is a long way, indeed. The second is\
  \ the good one: we don\u2019t understand each other so he is forced to write down\
  \ on my cardboard \u201C30 min\u201D. This camion is longer then the other one while\
  \ the guy is more collaborative even if he speaks only Russian. He offers me a big\
  \ cup of coffee while he is finishing to watch a Russian tv series, on the way I\
  \ try to remember one of the few words in Russian and I say \u201Cnasdroviya\u201D\
  \ (cheers) as a sign of gratitude. All the trip is accompanied by Ukrainian folk\
  \ music; it helps me at least to stay awake and to exchange a few words. Thanks\
  \ to him I\u2019m finally in Riga and only a few stops from a well-deserved bed.\
  \ Two days later, once on the bus to Tallinn, I discover that the cardboard I've\
  \ used to hitchhike is not with me anymore. I probably lost it on my way to the\
  \ bus station. I am disappointed, but it\u2019s proof that this wouldn't be my last\
  \ hitchhiking experience. Since then, I have learnt that things I loose while travelling\
  \ come back in a different shape. And they always do."
