Text: "This may sound a bit Eat pray Love kind of experience and in some ways, it\
  \ was. Routine, same friends and a 2 year boyfriend. Everything seemed perfectly\
  \ fine, my life was full of parties and fun you may say, yet something pulled me.\
  \ It\u2019s funny how years after things happen you understand why you made a decision\
  \ based on no grounds, grounds you later discover in yourself you needed in that\
  \ exact moment. \nSolitude is a funny thing. Many people are afraid of it, as if\
  \ it was someone weird they didn\u2019t know or could be harmful. Not for me. Since\
  \ I was little I liked to be alone, yet the last two years before I left for Italy\
  \ were full of company, and not necessarily the best one. I decided from the blue\
  \ I had to go away and be by myself, think, LIVE. When I say out of the blue I mean\
  \ how it looked, because in my head everything was on the right road. Yes, I cried\
  \ all the way to Italy, partly because I had just broken up with my boyfriend because\
  \ of it, and partly because deeply, I was eager to arrive and see what the universe\
  \ had waiting for me. \nI know six months may seem like a small time to change,\
  \ but the thing is I didn\u2019t. I went within. \nI visited all the museums, cities\
  \ and places I could. I enjoyed wine, coffe and reading by the Arno by myself. I\
  \ went running in the morning, cooked for muself and wrote every single day. I had\
  \ never been so connected to myself. I made unforgettable friends. Friends that\
  \ taught me the art of a glass of wine and a great conversation. Friends that taught\
  \ me it is brave to be alone and search for new experiences. Friends who taight\
  \ me how beautiful it is to be different and a lover, who taught me the most kind\
  \ and musical way to love. \nClich\xE9? Maybe for some. Those who\u2019ve walked\
  \ alone the streets of Rome, of Florence of Italy itself will know. \nI remember\
  \ everyday being different in it\u2019s own unique way. I would revisit my favorite\
  \ museums and stay in awe of the paintings, each time feeling something different.\
  \ My whole day would be in italian, to the point where my thoughts flew by in italian.\
  \ I am not used to walk in my city and I find something really soothing in it. I\
  \ never took it for granted. I may have looked insane when distances were big and\
  \ my friends wanted to take a bus and I wanted to walk, but I really adored it.\
  \ \nI fell in love with the most sensitive man. A man who taught me so much in such\
  \ a short time. No pressure to be, to look, to do anything. He looked at me in awe\
  \ either way. I wasn\u2019t used to such kind love, and now it is the only one I\
  \ feel I could live again. \nI didn\u2019t change in Italy, I found the girl that\
  \ had been screaming to get out for so long. She knew I had been blown away by parties\
  \ and social events but had forgotten about the most important person, me. I thank\
  \ her now, and recognize her. She still speaks to me though not so often, I guess\
  \ she feels good inside this new me I have created. A happier me. A truer me. \n\
  Italy was an amazing experience, but most of all, a beautiful rediscovering."
