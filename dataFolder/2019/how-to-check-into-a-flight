Text: "In 22 years, I\u2019ve seen my father cry twice. The first time was when we\
  \ watched \u201CA Little Prince\u201D together, it\u2019s an emotional film so I\
  \ get it. The second time was the night before I left for my first solo backpacking\
  \ trip. I had my rolling suitcase packed and a skeleton of a plan for the next year\
  \ laid out - a handful of key flights bought, a couple of volunteer stints set up.\
  \ We were sitting in the living room, him at the dining table and me in my usual\
  \ spot on the carpet with the dog. It was here that he realized I didn\u2019t know\
  \ that I was supposed to check into my flight before I got to the airport. After\
  \ an appropriate amount of yelling about how \u201Cunprepared\u201D I was, and a\
  \ little more than appropriate sass from my 18-year-old mouth, we went to the computer\
  \ and he showed me how to do it. This was the first of roughly twelve flights I\
  \ would make over the course of the next year. We were sitting at the computer,\
  \ my flight number halfway typed into Southwest\u2019s check-in page, and he stopped.\
  \ He took his hand off the keyboard and placed the tips of his thumb and pointer\
  \ finger on the bridge of his nose, head bowed, and he cried. I wish I could have\
  \ told him that everything was going to be fine, that I knew what I was doing, but\
  \ the truth was I was an 18-year-old girl, fresh out of high school, who didn\u2019\
  t know how to check into a flight. So, I didn\u2019t, because I couldn\u2019t know\
  \ what was going to happen. I couldn\u2019t know that I would miss my train three\
  \ times in Italy, and a fashion designer from Milan that I had just met would help\
  \ me find a taxi and hotel for the night. It would take me a full three days to\
  \ complete that trip where most people with an affinity for map reading, could make\
  \ it in one. But I would make it. I couldn\u2019t know that hiking in the Annapurna\u2019\
  s, my non-existent willpower would lead me to give all the sweets I brought for\
  \ the kids we passed along the way to the very first five I saw. Or that later,\
  \ our Nepali guide would ask me to marry him and we\u2019d play uno under the shadow\
  \ of the Himalayas until the stars came out. I couldn\u2019t know that every day\
  \ I was in Kenya, my friend would pick me up on a motorcycle and we would hit these\
  \ tiny speed bumps in the dirt road and because he would never actually slow down\
  \ we\u2019d bounce up and down off the seat. When we hit that part of the road,\
  \ he would turn back to me and yell \u201C100% free \u2013 African Massage.\u201D\
  \ And every day I would laugh, because it was always funny. I couldn\u2019t know\
  \ that I would inadvertently work at a Bavarian Ayahuasca retreat, catching chickens\
  \ and collecting walnuts while visitors inside would hallucinate at lively midnight\
  \ dance parties. But isn\u2019t that the fun part? The endless possibilities? The\
  \ mystery? So I let him cry, and I wrapped my arms around him as we sat in a tangible\
  \ almost silence and the next morning, having already checked into my flight, I\
  \ left."
