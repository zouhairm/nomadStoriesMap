Text: "Sardinia has two coastal winds: the maestrale, a cold, violent force that blows\
  \ in from the northwest, and the dreaded scirocco, a hot, dry wind from the Sahara,\
  \ bringing misery to all it touches. These wind storms last for one, three, or five\
  \ days. Never two, never four. No one knows why. \"Odd numbers are more artistic,\"\
  \ I imagine my mother saying. In Stintino, we\u2019re graced with the maestrale\
  \ for three days. That means no beach time. In tiny coastal town, there's not much\
  \ else to do. My native travel companion Marianna and I decide to drive to the eastern\
  \ coast, to Cala Ganone, where we've managed to reserve a bungalow, despite it being\
  \ Ferra Gosto, a holiday celebrating the Roman feasts of Augustus. We\u2019ll sleep\
  \ there, then travel south to Baunei, where we\u2019ll hike to Cala Goritz\xE8 to\
  \ swim in cerulean water. \"Are there bathrooms? Are there towels? Are there pillows?\"\
  \ Marianna's mother, GianCarla, asks in Italian, uncertain about this bungalow situation.\
  \ \" I didn't ask,\" Marianna replies in English. We grab our packs and hurry down\
  \ the path, avoiding the uneven bricks. GianCarla is yelling after us. \"O dio,\
  \ let's go,\" Mariana says as she shuts the tiny Volkswagen\u2019s trunk. As soon\
  \ as I've closed the passenger door, we're off along the narrow streets. There's\
  \ no stereo, and with the windows down there's no hope of hearing music from our\
  \ phones. \"You can talk to each other or look at the scenery.\" Marianna rolls\
  \ her eyes as she mimics her mother. I laugh, although GianCi has a point. \nWithin\
  \ minutes, we've left civilian life. We pass herd after herd of baaa-ing, antique-white\
  \ animals, their oversize bells clangingas they graze. Sardinia's primary source\
  \ of income is sheep. It has been for centuries. In fact, there are many centenarians\
  \ on the island. Some communities have a handful of people 100years and older. Maybe\
  \ it's because they live simple lives. They walk a lot. They only take what they\
  \ need. They're hard workers. They would never consider themselves Italian. They\u2019\
  re Sardinian through and through. They have a language all their own, a language\
  \ even Marianna can't understand. The landscape is desert-like, and unripe prickly\
  \ pears asyellow as the dirt contrast with the green cacti. I\u2019m surprised,\
  \ although I wasn't sure what I expected to see. A mountain range lingers in the\
  \ distance. \"That's where we\u2019re going.\" Marianna points to the highest peak.\
  \ \"The other side of that mountain.\" An hour into our drive, we come to the village\
  \ of Silanus. I see a long wall leading to a stone tower. \"What is THAT?!?\" Marianna\
  \ makes the turn off, and I feel excitement. I've never traveled with her before.\
  \ I'm glad her sense of adventure trackswith mine. We park near a gate and hop out,\
  \ meeting the dusty hot air with purpose. The structure is a Nuraghe. It's made\
  \ of basalt stones stacked in rows and dates to 1600 BC, but anthropologists don\u2019\
  t know what it was used for. We find the entrance on the tower\u2019s south side,\
  \ opening to a circular chamber with niches cut out to the north, east, and west.\
  \ Primitive stairs are to the left, and I touch each stone as I ascend to the roof,\
  \ leaving my fingerprints along with the thousands who climbed before me. The rocks\
  \ are almost pumice-like but denser, capable of holding tradition intact. The stones\
  \ that make up the roof are all shapes and colors, and grass that resembles hay\
  \ fights for life in the crevices. The wind\u2019s loud at that height. When I lean\
  \ into it, it holds me upright. Cattle graze to the south, and to my right a small\
  \ church stands lonely. The smell of Sardinia swirls around me, coming from a fragrant\
  \ plant called elicriso. Marianna has disappeared, and as I look in every direction\
  \ I\u2019mawed. This village, poor since the beginning of time, where artisans handwove\
  \ carpets and clothing, where schoolchildren traveled by donkey, where men raced\
  \ horses down the only flat road, where strangers were never denied a hot caff\xE8\
  \ and somewhere to rest, it seems so full of life, and a good one at that. It makes\
  \ sense Silanus\u2019s motto is 'The good way of life.'"
