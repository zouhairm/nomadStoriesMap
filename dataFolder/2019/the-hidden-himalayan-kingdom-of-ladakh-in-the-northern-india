Text: "I never thought that the day would eventually comes this quick when I was busy\
  \ distracting myself from all daily routines. But I was glad to do this with my\
  \ two craziest and yet kindest friends in my life. \n\nLeh is a town in the Leh\
  \ district of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. It was the capital of the Himalayan\
  \ kingdom of Ladakh.\n\nThe first time I knew this place from Indian movie called\
  \ \"3 Idiots\" back in 2009. Well I did not know very well of this place at that\
  \ time, but I was amazed by one of the movie scene in Pangong Tso (Tso means: Lake).\
  \ The lake looks very beautiful and unique, one of the biggest salted lake in the\
  \ world. This lake belong to two countries, India and Tibetan China.\n\nAfter been\
  \ waiting for almost ten years to make this dream come true, I eventually booked\
  \ my plane ticket in 2018 to India. I planned to do solo traveling but at the end,\
  \ two of my friends were interested to join.\n\nThe best and cheapest airfare route\
  \ was flying from New Delhi. There are several airplanes from Delhi to Leh, such\
  \ as: Jet Airways, Air India, Vistara, Go Air and Spicejet. Took a lot of preparations\
  \ to come to this Kingdom, especially during winter. Besides the altitude sickness,\
  \ we also fought with very cold temperature. As I remember, the lowest was - 31\xB0\
  C. For people from tropical country like us, it was really tough and struggling.\
  \ We even went to bed with complete winter coat and thermal in layers.\n\nEvery\
  \ traveler is suggested to take rest within 2 days, limit your movement and adjust\
  \ yourself with the acclimatization. Some of travelers will feel nauseous, dizzy\
  \ and hard to breathe. My suggestion is, take the medicines with you and buy an\
  \ oxycan (you can find this at Pharmacy in Leh).\n\nBeyond the efforts that I did\
  \ for this trip, I found many interesting stories and places during my visit in\
  \ Ladakh. First time I saw beautiful Himalayan mountains lied and covered with snow,\
  \ different culture and language to other part of India and delicious combination\
  \ of Indian and Tibetan food. Leh also gave me another perspective of religion,\
  \ even though majority are Tibetan Buddhist in this area, but I found a grand mosque\
  \ stood still near the main Bazaar. The Ladakh people told me about how people are\
  \ united in peace and harmony regardless their belief and faith.\n\nLeh has several\
  \ monasteries that you can visit, the only and one Leh Palace, Hall of Fame, Shanti\
  \ Stupa and more. If you love to see the festival, February onwards is the best\
  \ time to visit. To avoid the tourist crowd, I would recommend you to visit Ladakh\
  \ in September until November, not during the summer even though the best temperature\
  \ is starting from end of May but you will lose yourself among the crowd.\n\nLast\
  \ but not least, go and roam this Himalayan Kingdom with your best attitude and\
  \ intention. New things will follow and surprise you. I always keep telling myself\
  \ to do good to people and universe as much as I could. Remember, no matter how\
  \ far and high you travel, you can always get down in a sec when you rely on your\
  \ ego, cockiness and unable to accept things that you would learn along the trip.\n\
  \nI hope you will enjoy The Himalayan Kingdom of Ladakh and have a fabulous trip!"
