Text: "I wanted to zip up my jacket but my fingers had no dexterity. It was like they\
  \ were disconnected from the rest of my body, and there was a blown fuse between\
  \ my brain and spinal cord. I tried to closed my eyes with hope that this was just\
  \ a bad dream but a battlefield of icy snow pebbles struck my face like hard rocks.\
  \ The weather had changed like the wind, and in just seconds I was held hostage\
  \ by angry snow fall. \n\nWith one eye open, dodging the icy meteor shower, I could\
  \ barely make out the tiny dirt road in between the majestic cradle of land locked\
  \ mountains en route to Everest Base Camp (EBC) (5,380m). Ama Dablam looked like\
  \ she was just arms reach away; like if I stretched out my arms, I could touch her\
  \ highest peak with a bare frost-bitten finger. \n\nBefore I knew it, three of my\
  \ team members were adding layers on top of my thin fleece - the cold had frozen\
  \ my fingers and threatened to snatch my consciousness. I was lucky to receive a\
  \ timely thaw, and to walk away with all fingers intact but it was the roaring echo\
  \ of my own internal dialogue that haunted me \u201CDo I have what it takes to be\
  \ an expedition medic?\". \n\nI was quick to share my experience of hypothermia\
  \ with others as we trekked, learning that I was not alone in my adversity -  a\
  \ beautiful reminder of unity that is important in the Wilderness. Our medical learning\
  \ along the way also coincided with the physiological changes in my body, and helped\
  \ me see my setbacks as opportunities for learning. \n\nAt our next rest stop I\
  \ spotted Majeet Dai, one of the porters in our trekking group. Of the 30,000 people\
  \ who trek the Himalayas every year, over 50% of the population are Nepali Sherpas\
  \ and porters like him. Our medical camps are run by Western doctors, with few to\
  \ none Nepali doctors available. Therefore, delivery of culturally appropriate health\
  \ care is relatively poor. Manjeet dai and others alike just want opportunities\
  \ to connect with other natives who are interested in listening to his stories and\
  \ helping his community. Sharing a conversation together in our native tongue was\
  \ humbling and I felt positioned exactly where I was supposed to be.   \n \nAt the\
  \ ninth hour - I collapsed on a nearby boulder and held my head in my hands in agony.\
  \ I took three deep breaths of oxygen thin air into my lungs, and gushed down two\
  \ gulps of purified water to medicate my screw driver headache. At first glance,\
  \ I was nestled in a crystal blue glacier, with Everest perched quietly behind.\
  \ I felt the holy presence in the mountains with the flap of the colourful Buddhist\
  \ flags in the gentle breeze above the symbolic Stuppa of EBC. The orange tents\
  \ scattered across the glacier free terrains reminded me of the nineteen people\
  \ killed by the Ice Avalanche in 2015 - a testimony to the ferocity of mother nature\
  \ and the boldness of the mountaineers who still risk their lives.  Deepak dai pointed\
  \ towards one of these faintly visible tents in the distance as the Himalayan Rescue\
  \ Association (HRA), a safety house for mountaineers who aim to reach the summit.\
  \   \n\nOn reaching EBC, it wasn't the celebratory Khukhuri rum mixers and dancing\
  \ to folk tunes with porters, or collapsing in exhaustion from two weeks of trekking\
  \ that left me feeling fulfilled. It was coming back home with peace of mind amidst\
  \ the monotonous routine of full time work knowing I\u2019d have another opportunity\
  \ to go back out there again and feeling a burning passion in my soul that set on\
  \ fire and burst into flames every time I met another Expedition medic.\n\nIt was\
  \ never about whether I had what it takes; the life of an Expedition medic is about\
  \ how it will change you, and my experience moulded me into the best version of\
  \ myself. Today, I am one step closer to standing inside one of those colourful\
  \ orange tents and being a part of the action on the mountain as I wait to be called\
  \ out to my next adventure with the HRA."
