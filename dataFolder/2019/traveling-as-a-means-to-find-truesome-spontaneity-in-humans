Text: "Nepal is a vast land and in recent years I have chosen to travel without a\
  \ very well defined itinerary, no more than a loose sense of direction but nonetheless\
  \ with a purpose, which sounds very contradictory, but it is not, as we shall see.\
  \ Certain things in life, and I must add, the truly genuine gestures are not to\
  \ be found in a structured setting where one is expected to behave in a prescribed,\
  \ contrived way, which applies to both the tourist and the host.\nOnce I got my\
  \ driver's license in the late 70's I became  interested in remote beaches of Brazil,\
  \ all now, with no exception, highly developed and visited by the affluent crowd,\
  \ minimally affordable to the low-budget visitor. At about the same time, in a trip\
  \ to LA visiting some friends who were going to cinema school at USC, I stumbled\
  \ upon a bookstore that catered to Eastern philosophies, bought a few books and\
  \ became fascinated by what to me was a unique approach to spiritual teachings,\
  \ in stark contrast to the traditional Catholic and Protestant I grew up with. These\
  \ two elements, a quest for a more pure, unfiltered human behavior and small Buddhist\
  \ monasteries, have taken me to many trips deep in the Himalayas in search of the\
  \ few remaining Tibetan gompas where I still find examples of the deepest love,\
  \ unfettered hospitality with no interest in any kind of reward.\nYears back, my\
  \ friend Fabiano and I headed north from Gorkha in the Manaslu area, slowly gaining\
  \ altitude as we passed many villages through the myriad of trails that crisscross\
  \ that country, one valley splitting in two or more, creating opportunity of infinite\
  \ possibilities and discoveries. It was about midday, we were hungry and moderately\
  \ tired, when we came across a modest house surrounded by patches of a variety of\
  \ vegetables. There we were received by the one nun, her head  shaved shaved, donning\
  \ the traditional burgundy robe. She promptly agreed on cooking lunch for us and\
  \  led us to the kitchen were we sat on a few rocks around the fire while she prepared\
  \ our meal and her cat roamed around, walking over our laps looking for affection\
  \ from those strangers. My eyes were fixed on the fired when I suddenly felt something\
  \ caressing my arm, barely touching my hairs, only to realize it was the nun's hand.\
  \ What struck me most during those 30 or so seconds is that she did not stop tending\
  \ the fire or stirring the pot. Many thoughts flew through my mind as to why she\
  \ would be doing that to me. Physical, for sure. Sexual, unlikely. Days passed and\
  \ I kept thinking and analyzing. For her I was a pet, just simply an animal with\
  \ hair, just like her cat, something different from the hairless locals and foreigners\
  \ who happen to reach her place. In hindsight it was no more than that, no advance,\
  \ no disrespect, no invasion of my space.\nDifferent peoples think differently,\
  \ reason differently, see things differently, interpret differently. Globalization\
  \ is homogenizing us all, setting standards and preconceived ideas as to how we\
  \ should behave. \nIt is interesting to see people but it is even better for me\
  \ to understand how they see us.\nSometimes we leap into the unknown but it is even\
  \ better when the unknown leaps onto us."
