Text: "I am amazed by the fact that I participated in the event \u201CThe Walk of\
  \ Ta\u2019aruf and Saremba Katente Tembe\u201D a year ago. Men, women, children,\
  \ adults, and in the name of the institution they brought, people from across this\
  \ region gathered in the central of Dompu and through their unique way, they became\
  \ colorful by the Tembe they were wearing. I have been trembled even more when the\
  \ colorful crowd walked on the street aiming at the Building of Center Government\
  \ as their last destination. By the time we were arrived, we continued the procession\
  \ with dancing and throwing Tembe from our hands to the air together and tried to\
  \ catch it again. I had never seen hundreds of people, flinging Tembe and making\
  \ full colors of rings in the air like what I had just enjoyed.\n\nThe region is\
  \ dominated by Muslim people and they possess a very special way of wearing sarong.\
  \ It\u2019s not only for men, but women wearing. I was on duty of teaching and traveling\
  \ in Dompu for 6 months back then. It was more than sufficient to identify their\
  \ Tembe, a traditional woven sarong, its usefulness, and the way they wear it. Tembe\
  \ is made of original yarn from Bima, the capital of West Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia.\
  \ Moreover, it is believed that Tembe is as comfortable as its ability in adjusting\
  \ to the body temperature of the person who is wearing it. It cools you whenever\
  \ the weather is hot and warms you during the cold night. Therefore, in their daily\
  \ life Dompu people wear it around their face during days to avoid sunlight\u2019\
  s burn and use it as a blanket in the nights. However, in a special occasion, it\
  \ turns out to be the social level consideration of these people. The more complex-patterned\
  \ and expensive the clothes, the higher the power embedded to them. \n\t\nWhat is\
  \ more interesting than the social power owned by Tembe is the fashion of Dompu\
  \ people in wearing it. The men wear them as common as Muslim people wear sarong\
  \ whenever they do their pray. They just make it shorter around their knees. Meanwhile,\
  \ the women do a lot more of effort in wearing it. They transform a sarong into\
  \ a neat veil that covers their head, chest, and nearly reach their belly. Don\u2019\
  t take it for granted, wearing this is not easy. I should practice for a few times\
  \ to get this appearance.\n \nLooking at the history, the tradition of wearing Rimpu\
  \ has long become the legacy from Dompu elderly. They passes to their daughter,\
  \ and granddaughter the unique technique of wearing veil which nowadays called hijab\
  \ style, since no one remembered. \n\nBeyond that, the tradition of wearing Rimpu\
  \ reminds me that tradition could be flexible sometimes. It has its more contemporary\
  \ style after I observed them in the celebration of \u201Cthe walk of Ta\u2019aruf\
  \ and Saremba Katente Tembe\u201D. The celebration itself, originally conducted\
  \ for the custom events only, but nowadays it is predominant for moment of togetherness\
  \ such as anniversary of Dompu or celebrating president visitation. The era and\
  \ habits change, but the roots of them remain the same."
