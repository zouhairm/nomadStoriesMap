Text: "Travelling can be another way of enlightenment, the answer that you were looking\
  \ for in a chaotic stage of life. \n\nThis is a personal story worth sharing to\
  \ those who find their selves in a never ending loop of darkness, lack of power\
  \ to move on, or just simply looking for a meaningful life. I like the quote \"\
  If you don't like where you are, move. You are not a tree\". I applied this idea\
  \ seven years ago, where you would find me in a moment in life where everything\
  \ had no meaning anymore, love, career, even the situation in the country I used\
  \ to live in had a really bad prospect. \n\nFed up of everything I decided to earn\
  \ as much as I could and fleet to Calgary, Alberta. I was grateful of having my\
  \ sister living there and I spent wonderful 6 months learning how to appreciate\
  \ the unity of family and unconditional love. But that was not the final destination\
  \ of my spiritual journey. While I was there, I got an unexpected news where I would\
  \ have the chance to live in China for 6 months, I didn't think it twice and I flew\
  \ back to Spain to start processing my papers. \n\nAnd there I was, in a new culture,\
  \ new environment and with a lot of language barrier. China is not an easy country,\
  \ but what I've learned while staying here is to embrace the moment, to be open-minded\
  \ and respect. Those are the basic pillars of experiencing life to its fullest.\
  \ During my stay, I had my moments of loneliness and even periods of anxiety, it\
  \ was my first time living alone in the unknown where there wasn't any support or\
  \ a close arm to lean on. People were still strangers. But during these years I've\
  \ learned a lot, specially of not being scared, on pushing my limits to realize\
  \ my own capabilities and empower me. \n\nSo now, I look back and see my 27-year-old\
  \ self gazing into space and living in a life full of chaos, wondering how she could\
  \ change her situation and now I feel that there is nothing to worry about as long\
  \ as you move. Moving forward or moving somewhere else, you will always find the\
  \ answer you were looking for. \n\nLife is full of uncertainty but also blesses\
  \ you with surprises and gratification. The moment you have reached another level\
  \ of enlightenment is what make this living precious. The people you meet, the music\
  \ you feel, the silence... everything counts to appreciate this roller-coaster journey.\
  \ And that is how I feel every time I travel, to understand more the world where\
  \ I'm living in, to keep unforgettable memories and to say, this is the journey\
  \ worth spent while on Earth."
