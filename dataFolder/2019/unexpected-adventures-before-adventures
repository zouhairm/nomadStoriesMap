Text: "It was not easy, but I was able to get up at 5am as planned. During the previous\
  \ night, I had agreed with the owners of the antique and falling apart hotel I stayed,\
  \ an old Chinese couple, I was leaving very early in the morning and needed the\
  \ door open for me. Don\u2019t ask me how I did it. They didn\u2019t speak a word\
  \ of English and my mandarin served only to order dishes and to say thank you..\
  \ Nothing very useful in a village, in the north of Laos, almost bordering China.\n\
  \nPhongsaly is a city of 6,000 inhabitants and according to some research I did\
  \ before, the only reason is not part of China today, is because France didn\u2019\
  t want to lose any centimetre of Indochina. Far from the capital Vientiane and near\
  \ nowhere in southern China, its ancient Chinese architecture was well preserved.\
  \ And it also became the starting point for trails through isolated villages and\
  \ local tribes.\n\nIt was still dark as I walked through the town beautiful small\
  \ wooden houses to go to the tourist agency's office, where our adventure was about\
  \ to start. When I arrived, I found my Finnish mate with a sad and disappointed\
  \ face.\n\n\u2212\tWe have a problem. The officer here forgot to arrange a guide\
  \ for us. \u2013 She said.\n\u2212\tWhat do you mean? \n\u2212\tI think he drank\
  \ to much last night and forgot it. No Akha tribes for us today.\n\nAkha is an ethnic\
  \ group that lives in the northern of Thailand, Laos and Vietnam. Even with all\
  \ difficulties, they kept their own way of dressing up, their language, ceremonies\
  \ and opium production. They hosted few small groups of tourist from time to time,\
  \ but their main profit was still the drug smuggling to China. As Government had\
  \ tightened control, they had to find other sources of income. Tourism was one of\
  \ them.\n\nThe tourist officer was walking back and forth with the mobile in his\
  \ hand. As soon as our third group mate arrived, I broke the news to her. But after\
  \ some clear tense minutes, the officer laughed out loud.\n\n\u2212\tTrail OK. You\
  \ trail today. Guide comes.\n\nOur guide, a tall, smiling young man arrived about\
  \ 30 minutes later.\n\n\u2212\tGood morning. Sorry, but I was only told to come\
  \ now.  \u2013 He greeted us with a heavy breath of alcohol. \u2013 I think I'm\
  \ still a bit hangover from yesterday's wedding party. \n\nWe started in the back\
  \ of a truck that took us to the Phongsaly bus station, where we entered a falling\
  \ apart bus. \nTaking a narrow dirt road, I could see the sunrise through a sea\
  \ of clouds. It inspired me. We arrived at a giant dam built by the Chinese Government\
  \ to generate electricity, which in fact only generated problems for the locals.\
  \ The river, which flooded large areas of Laotian forest and villages, served as\
  \ the main form of computing in the past. Now, a trip that usually would take something\
  \ like 1h takes at least 3h via a dusty and poorly maintained dirt road. \n\nA small-motorized\
  \ wooden boat was waiting there. We sailed trough recently flooded woods and mountains,\
  \ full of rubber plantations and beautiful forests. Despite all the difficulties,\
  \ that sense of adventure was beginning to flood me too.\n\nAfter a short sail,\
  \ dead trees and branches blocked our passage.\n\n\u2212\tThe trail does not start\
  \ here yet. \u2013 Told our guide disappointed. \u2013 But I don\u2019t think we\
  \ have a choice. Everything will be all right. \u2013 He said trying to look confident.\n\
  \nWe disembarked into a dense forest and found ourselves among branches, giant leaves,\
  \ much clay and wooden stumps. I tried to calm our friends. But even I could not\
  \ reassure myself. \n\n\u2212\tI'm not afraid of the woods, but of terrestrial mines\
  \ that have not yet exploded. - Repeated the Finnish, mirroring our concern.\n\u2212\
  \tThere are no more mines here. \u2013 Said our guide, but not inspiring  certainty.\n\
  \nA 20-minute walk led us to an open clearing with some wooden huts scattered over\
  \ manioc plantations. The guide explained that it was the official beginning of\
  \ the trail and had our name registered with the brown and worn skin inhabitants.\
  \ The adventurous trail was about to begin."
