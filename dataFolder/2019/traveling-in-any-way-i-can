Text: "I always wanted to travel, but always found myself giving the \u201Cno money,\
  \ no time\u201D excuse. So, I decided to take a different approach from what I considered\
  \ to be the \u201Ctraditional way to travel.\u201D\n\nI talked to my school and\
  \ decided to volunteer in Majuro, Marshall Islands for the school year 2018/2019.\
  \ This approach allowed me to connect with people, by doing something selfless,\
  \ all at the same time testing if traveling is something I\u2019d really want to\
  \ do. \n\nHere I am roughly 7,000 miles away from school (Riverside, California)\
  \ and roughly 3,000 miles away from home (Brockton, Massachusetts) on my 6th month,\
  \ and have 4 months left to go and I\u2019ve grown and discovered  so much about\
  \ myself and my likes and dislikes.\n\nI\u2019m currently teaching Bible to grades\
  \ 7 to 12, and although I found out that I hate teaching their age group, I love\
  \ being part of their experience and them of mine.\n\nAbout traveling, I found out\
  \ that I absolutely love traveling whether that is in a form of hiking, taking a\
  \ road trip, flying in or out of country, or taking a boat ride to my destination.\
  \ I love the experience, that I get to cary as memory for the rest of my life, I\
  \ love the impact I get to make, and get imprinted in me as well. Although I must\
  \ confess that I enjoy some personal time in between here and there. \n\nI completely\
  \ emerged into the unknown by coming to Majuro as it is my first time, exploring\
  \ the place, the culture and the amazing people. I must admit that I have no regrets,\
  \ and I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019d love to continue traveling in the future.\
  \ Ideally I\u2019d love to travel for a career, but if that doesn\u2019t work out,\
  \ I will always include it in my life."
