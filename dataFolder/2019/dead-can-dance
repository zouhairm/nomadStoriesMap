Text: "It was raining heavily in Santiago that night. I tried to jump a puddle unsuccessfully\
  \ and my shoes got soaked. No busses passed. There was no way to reach the other\
  \ side of the city where a strange group of Chileans and Spaniards I had met months\
  \ before was waiting for me. When I gave up, I began to remember. To remember with\
  \ sorrow.\nThe Carretera Austral extends for 1240 kms. in the extreme south of Chile.\
  \ Like a primordial serpent, it goes wildly into a territory populated by thousand-year-old\
  \ forests, infinity of lakes and rivers, ice fields, glaciers, and volcanoes. As\
  \ a traveler, it was one of my greatest dreams. So that summer I didn't think twice\
  \ and threw myself into the roads with a friend. Although the landscapes seemed\
  \ to be taken from myth, meeting people is what really gives life to a trip, as\
  \ every traveler knows.\nMy friend \xC1lvaro and I knew each other from university\
  \ and we had endured a lot together, from academic pressure to heartbreaks. Of course,\
  \ this did not stop us from having arguments during the trip from time to time.\
  \ Arguing is necessary when traveling with company. It agitates the waters a little\
  \ bit so you can have different perspectives. \nWe were happy nonetheless but my\
  \ intention, what I had called the heart of the trip, was to reach Caleta Tortel,\
  \ a small town of no more than five hundred inhabitants built into the delta of\
  \ the Baker River and where there are no roads. Instead, it is full of walkways\
  \ and wooden stairs. Secretly, the heart of the trip was even deeper: reach the\
  \ small Island of the Dead, an hour's navigation from Caleta Tortel where several\
  \ crosses in the middle of the thick vegetation gave the place mystery. No one was\
  \ sure who the dead buried there really were or how they died. Some said they were\
  \ loggers from Chilo\xE9, an island to the north. Or that they died of illnesses\
  \ or an epidemic that left no witnesses. Life is full of questions and death full\
  \ of certainties, certainties that are unattainable for the living.\nTo get to this\
  \ place we had to form a group of several people in Cochrane, the closest city.\
  \ This was when we met the rest of the gang: a couple of young Chileans, a couple\
  \ of old Chileans, and a couple of Spanish adventurers. The whole group left for\
  \ Tortel and while we were advancing along the winding and difficult dirt road,\
  \ we got to know each other and strengthen ties. When traveling, the intensity increases\
  \ and in a matter of days, or hours, one can know others with strange depth. This\
  \ is how the \"families of the road\" are formed.\nOnce in Tortel, the eight members\
  \ of this family were fully blended. As the archipelagos of the south of Chile that\
  \ count the islands by thousands, we joined our individualities contributing to\
  \ the whole. Together we collected money to rent the boat and get to the island.\
  \ Once there, magic invaded us. I moved away from the group and in a ritual act\
  \ I took out the poem book I had and opened it to a random page. The poem on that\
  \ page was called \"Throw Water to the Dead\" and it was the perfect closure for\
  \ this trip.\nThis is why I was remembering with sorrow. It was at that moment,\
  \ months later in Santiago, that I was able to notice the close relationship between\
  \ oblivion and death. In time, I thought, we too would become the dead who give\
  \ themselves up to oblivion, strangers who were family once. But that's the way\
  \ it should be; all trips must come to an end and not because of this they are less\
  \ beautiful. The dead can also dance when they understand this subtle truth."
