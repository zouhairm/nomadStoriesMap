Text: "The earthen flower pots of bright pink, red and yellow roses lined along the\
  \ edge of the small terrace at the \u2018Guven Cave Hotel\u2019 adds to the contrast\
  \ with the monochromatic landscape that abounds this strange and barren terrain\
  \ of Goreme, Cappadocia. Conical rock formations of varying sizes are scattered\
  \ all over this quaint tourist-town, where the only constant noise I hear is the\
  \ twitter of birds making their way back to their nests while the evening descends,\
  \ only to be interrupted by a happy-bark of a dog nearby. As the gentle breeze blows\
  \ across, the temperature falls sharply, even during mid-May, adding yet another\
  \ layer to the contrast that exists between the scorching day and chilly evenings.\n\
  \nLooking out at the enigmatic yet bewildering landscape, far atop a tall hill,\
  \ one can spot the proud red Turkish flag billowing, enjoying a commanding view\
  \ of the entire town, littered with shrubs and patches of rare greenery. A multitude\
  \ of hotels have mushroomed all over this small town from the most basic to the\
  \ absolute exotic. Most of them are themed on the terrain itself \u2013 cave hotels,\
  \ promising tourists a unique experience.\n\nAnd suddenly, there it comes \u2013\
  \ the resounding call for prayers from the tall minaret of the local mosque, echoing\
  \ through the narrow streets, washing the town clean of ill-omens and reminding\
  \ us that God is the greatest and that He, is beyond time, direction and description!\
  \ The chant is hypnotic and evocative in the background of the vast expansive grey\
  \ skies, gently seducing the night.\n\nFrom the terrace of the hotel where I sit,\
  \ one can see the empty meandering streets below, save the occasional tourist bus\
  \ ferrying people in and out of this fairy-tale town. At the restaurant above the\
  \ terrace, I can hear the local people gathered together breaking their fast for\
  \ the day during this holy month of Ramadan. It\u2019s a big event. Families getting\
  \ together and breaking bread on the same table \u2013 the only meal of the day,\
  \ and it is an elaborate one.\n\nThe street lights have lit up now and begin to\
  \ shimmer. In the horizon there are sporadic bursts of lightening, threatening rain.\
  \ The clouds begin to rumble. To live in a place like this \u2013 all year round!\
  \ How magical, how visceral, I wonder! Meanwhile, I can hear the clinking of glass\
  \ cups upstairs, signaling the conclusion of dinner and the commencement of \u2018\
  chai\u2019. Those transparent tulip shaped glasses that the Turks love to drink\
  \ their apple-flavoured, golden coloured tea in. The chatter is convivial and infectious.\
  \ And then comes the rain, plummeting the temperature further below, along with\
  \ sharp gusts of chilly breeze. I decide to rush indoors before the rain picks up\
  \ speed. At the reception, the hotel manager informs me that the temperatures here\
  \ can shoot up to 49\u2070C in the peak of summer and fall down to almost - 20\u2070\
  C in the dead of winter.\n\nThankfully, the rain does not last very long and I quickly\
  \ put on my wind-cheater and decide to go out for a walk. I always find new places\
  \ much more exposed and authentic when on foot. I keep my pace at a gentle stroll\
  \ and try to absorb the character of the place. The town-centre is dotted with eating\
  \ joints specializing in the local favourite \u2018pottery kebap\u2019 and souvenir\
  \ shops with aggressive salesmen trying to lure customers to step in. Most of them\
  \ are fluent in many languages and can be sharp-witted. \u201CYou are from Hindistan\
  \ eh? Let me tempt you with something you do not need but must have!\u201D one of\
  \ them remarks with a grin. I respectfully nod in the negative and keep moving.\
  \ As I walk past the ATMs and tourist offices offering balloon rides and bicycle\
  \ tours, a pleasant melody of Turkish violin wafts in. As I look inside the small\
  \ shack, I notice an elderly gentleman sitting inside, on a makeshift chair, pouring\
  \ over a car battery, a radio by his side. A plethora of instruments and contraptions\
  \ lay scattered on the floor. He looks up startled by my sudden presence in his\
  \ sanctuary. \u201CMerhaba!\u201D I say, and almost spontaneously he eases up and\
  \ smiles back at me \u201CMerhaba!\u201D"
