Text: In so many years, I have had the opportunity to travel to many beautiful places,
  but last year I had the chance to go back home, after 12 months abroad without even
  knowinf if I could ever go back. And that, that is the story I want to tell you
  now. I had to leave my country in 2017 due to its critical political, economical
  and social situation, and by the time I had the opportunity to go back, I became
  the happiest person I had ever been. I did not expect to find such joy, love and
  content in a place that a year from that, was just where I spent time when I was
  not traveling abroad. Going back to Venezuela was not only about partying again
  in my favorite places, having brunch at my favorite restaurants or going to my favorite
  beaches every weekend; it was going back to friends, to family, to all the joyful
  moments that had been fulfilling my journey through so many years. In the end, traveling
  back home was all about realizing how happy I had been my whole life, and finally
  giving myself the opportunity to appreciate that, because it made me see how happy
  I could get to be from now on, not from money, neither from expensive trips, but
  from being around everything I have truly ever loved.  And that chance is absolutely
  priceless.
