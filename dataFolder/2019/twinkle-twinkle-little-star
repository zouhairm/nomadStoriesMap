Text: "He is small.\n\nI do not know how old he is because I don't know how to calculate\
  \ ages of children. But Mario, the most little of the youngest in the summer camp,\
  \ turned five there. And he is smaller than Mario.\n\nAnyway, it doesn't matter.\
  \ Because he would not be five years old even if he was.\nHe is small, he is very\
  \ small, but he is not a child.\n\nHe's a straight brown fringe, a handful of freckles,\
  \ and prematurely rough hands. And some sneakers with worn soles, a woolen sweater\
  \ and the deaddest smile in Istanbul.\nHe is an accordion that whimpers between\
  \ his fingers, and a little pot with three cold coins.\nAnd that stupid happy music\
  \ that sounds sad precisely because it's too cheerful.\nAnd a card in the floor,\
  \ that says \"Give me for food, sir\"\nAnd two black eyes.\nAnd he is so little.\n\
  But he is not a child.\n\nHe is not a child. No way.\nHow will he be if he already\
  \ knows how to smile with a lie, if has forgotten how you dream about simple happy\
  \ things? I he ever knew. \nIf he has more life between his fingers than I can write\
  \ in all my notebooks.\nIf his eyes look sad when he sings.\n\nHe is not a child,\
  \ but he is small.\nVery small."
