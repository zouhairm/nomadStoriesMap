Text: "\"Once a year go the place you have never been there\" Dalai Lama Said. I really\
  \ like this quote. I Love having an adventure and travelling experience. \nAt 2014,\
  \ It was one of my most memorable and impressive journey at least until now. I could\
  \ visit one country that has so many historical sites and hidden beautifulness and\
  \ uniqueness, Turkey with my family. The journey felt so short but it was so impressive\
  \ for me. I had only 3 days to visit one of the biggest city of the country, Istanbul.\
  \ \n\nI have visited some countries. There are 2 countries that make me want to\
  \ go back again there, Istanbul and Singapore. I really like those kind of two countries\
  \ due to the convinience. \n\nTerritotically, Istanbul stands for two continents,\
  \ Asia and Europe.  However, Turkey is legally known as one of European country.\
  \ This is a large country with a well-built infrastructure of the cities. Seems\
  \ the government have a good concern to keep this country looks good for tourism.\
  \ \n\nAt the first time I landed at Ataturk airport, It was such an excited experience\
  \ for me. Having the fresh air and cool temperature where I never felt it in my\
  \ country. Since it is a tropical country. Getting aournd 7 deegrees of temparature\
  \ was absolutely wonderful for me.\n\nGuided by the local tourist guide who has\
  \ a very excelent pronounciation of our languange, Bahasa, made the journey felt\
  \ much fun. \n3 days were definitely very limited time to explore the large city\
  \ such as Istanbul. I was only going to the some icons of the country like Hagia\
  \ Sophia, Blue Mosque, Bosphorus Strait and Topkapi Palace. \n\nHowever, Hagia Sophia\
  \ and Topkapi Palace were impressing me so much. Hagia Sophia was built firstly\
  \ as a Mosque. Then during the Crusade, the function was changed became a Cathedral.\
  \ And now it is a museum. You can imagine the long history of this building. \n\n\
  Another site we visited was Topkapi Palace. This is like another museum. But the\
  \ different is it stores so many history of the prophets. Like the stick of Moses,\
  \ sword of David, sword of Muhammad and many others historical stuffs especially\
  \ for Moslem. \n\nIt was really enjoyable journey going to Istanbul. eventhough\
  \ we only have a very short time, but for me it was so fun."
