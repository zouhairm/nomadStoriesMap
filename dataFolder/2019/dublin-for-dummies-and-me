Text: "Boredom often leads to something, and in this case it was a maiden visit to\
  \ Dublin for this South African, and it turned out to be anything but boring.\n\n\
  After spending a few days in Crewe with the boyfriend's family, I suggested a weekend\
  \ in Dublin, because - well, because in-laws. So a quick google search, and accommodation,\
  \ a ferry ride to Dublin and a train ticket to Holyhead in Wales - all quickly sorted.\n\
  \nWhen booking the ferry, opt for the fast one and spend the time on deck. Your\
  \ hair will have the windswept look to a factor of 20 000 and you won't feel your\
  \ face much but the experience of actually getting to Dublin turned out to be a\
  \ highlight. I spent the duration under my hooded rain jacket curled up in a fetal\
  \ position, sitting on the deck floor, grinning like a maniac. Totally worth it.\n\
  \nArriving at the Dublin Port, there was a group of guys there for a stag weekend\
  \ having a laugh, and while we were making our way into the terminal the one guy\
  \ mentions having to show his ID, and suddenly it dawned on me. \n\nAll holidays\
  \ need that \"OH F****\" moment right? Major Geography fail! \nI realized that I\
  \ had left my passport at my friend's place which I was using as my base for the\
  \ holiday, and upon heading down to Crewe, I hadn't felt the need to take it with\
  \ me, but now I was now entering the Republic of Ireland, we were no longer united.\
  \ \n\nYou don't understand panic stations until it hits you. And it hits you hard.\n\
  I waited till I was the last person to be cleared and then explained my predicament\
  \ to the officials. Of course they returned the favor explaining how it was impossible\
  \ for me to enter, and I got the obligatory geography lesson. \nMy partner found\
  \ it hilarious. I tried to convince him to go without me. Our accommodation was\
  \ booked and I hated for it to go to waste. \nHanding over my South African ID -\
  \ not sure why I thought that would help, and why the hell did I have that and not\
  \ my passport, I try get hold of my friend. Thinking maybe there's a way to get\
  \ the documents to me. If need be I could spend the night in the port and the document\
  \ would arrive the next day. Right? \n\nI don't know what happened, but maybe I\
  \ looked like I was about to burst into tears, but one of the custom officials suggested\
  \ my friend take photos of my documents and my visa and send that through. While\
  \ she was doing that, the other guy returned with my ID and said, it's fine, go\
  \ through. I was totally flabbergasted. I didn't expect to find any leniency / compassion\
  \ or pity when it came to something as serious as passport control. My friend's\
  \ message beeped and I showed them the photos of my documents, which they glanced\
  \ at and waved me on. When I eventually calmed myself down, we realized the entire\
  \ port terminal was empty. We had missed the bus that takes passengers out, so we\
  \ consulted google, and started walking. \n\nNext thing an official car with lights\
  \ flashing comes by and then screeches to a stop in front of us, and I'm thinking\
  \ oh no, they've changed their minds and they're going to arrest me, or send me\
  \ back, but it was the immigration officer, and he offered us a ride to our hotel.\
  \ We all laughed about the incident in the car, and then the thought occurred...\
  \ oh wait... but now what if I can't get back in to the UK?  It eventually took\
  \ a few beers for me to stop stressing. There wasn't too much I could do at this\
  \ point, so I just ordered another Guinness.\n\nSo here's my tip, no matter where\
  \ you go, if you think you won't need your passport, just take it anyway. \n\nAnd\
  \ I'm typing this from South Africa so the UK let me back in, and let me out. Phew."
