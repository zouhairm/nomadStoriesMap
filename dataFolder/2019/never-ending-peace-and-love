Text: "While exploring the striking city of Kathmandu, Nepal in October 2018, I quickly\
  \ realized that I had no idea the richness of culture that lied deep in this Asian\
  \ country. While doing a locally guided tour of the city, our guide Milan explained\
  \ the saturated culture that lied not only in Nepal, but in the people of Nepal\
  \ as well. After seeing several sites, touring the Boudhanath stupa and watching\
  \ the burning rituals along the Bagmati river, I knew I needed to go deeper, in\
  \ order to fully experience the Nepalis history and culture. Perhaps it was the\
  \ cloud of smoke that overtook me as I watched the burning rituals, but in that\
  \ moment I knew spiritually and physically that I wanted to experience this culture\
  \ to the fullest. That evening we worked through a plan with Milan to hike the Annapurna\
  \ Trail.  \nAfter a day of shopping for all my trekking supplies from the local\
  \ shops, we left the next day to embark on a 5 day trekking expedition through the\
  \ Annapurna circuit. My first day of trekking was filled with excitement as well\
  \ as a little bit anxiety, not knowing what the Himalayan mountain experience was\
  \ to bring. At the start of second day, I was unexpectedly confident after waking\
  \ up feeling relaxed and refreshed after completing the 4.3 mile hike the day before.\
  \ That quickly changed as we started our 3 hour trek of pure stairs. Little did\
  \ I know, those stairs would be a defining moment for my experience. Those stairs\
  \ were not only physically challenging, but also unexpectedly mentally and spiritually\
  \ challenging also. Emotions I've never experienced before came through me and with\
  \ fear, doubt and untimalety some excitement, I was able to work through them all\
  \ as I trekked through those stairs and across the Himalayan mountains. Seeing the\
  \ local porters carrying packs, larger than them in some cases, gave me not only\
  \ motivation, but it also gave me intense gratitude. These men worked tirelessly\
  \ in often treacherous conditions, in an effort to support their families, who often\
  \ live hundreds of miles away. \n\nAfter completing each long day of trekking, we\
  \ all gathered at the local lodges for home cooked meals and a chance for a sliver\
  \ of warmth next to the wood burning fireplace. These lodges were bare bones, with\
  \ no heating or cooling, exterior squat toilets, cold showers and plywood beds with\
  \ a thin cushion for beds. What these lodges did have was the warmth of the locals\
  \ who operated them and the community that lived in the villages that welcomed every\
  \ trekker as if they were their own family. As the  children ran around outside\
  \ chasing the local chickens, their faces brightened up when they saw a trekker\
  \ come by. They often squealed and ran over at the chance to say namaste, give you\
  \ a high five or ask what country you are from. During the middle of my trek, I\
  \ caught some kind of cold that gave me a rough cough, body chills and a fever.\
  \ The locals constantly walked up to me to bring me a cup of their amazing traditional\
  \ favorite hot lemon tea, which I have yet to be able to duplicate to this day,\
  \ and checked on me as if I was their own family. \n\nOn my last day of trekking,\
  \ I remember being overcome with a bit of sadness as I boarded the local bus to\
  \ start my descent back to Kathmandu and ultimately back to the USA. I have never\
  \ experienced a country so rich in history, culture, as well as tragedies, while\
  \ always extending its arms out and welcoming travelers from all over the world.\
  \ I left Nepal a better person physically, mentally, and most importantly spiritually.\
  \ The experiences I had during my trek of the Himalayan mountains and experiencing\
  \ several local cities throughout Nepal along the way can only be described like\
  \ one of the local porter's I meet along the way once told me, Never Ending Peace\
  \ And Love. Also known as the meaning of the letters spelling out Nepal."
