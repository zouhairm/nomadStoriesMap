Text: "Japan is one of the most sought tourist destination around the world. And I\
  \ happen to be lucky enough to have a sister and a cousin working there. So I had\
  \ the chance to visit Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka last March 2017. I decided to come\
  \ to Japan and just meet my 18 year old son there.  He traveled together with my\
  \ mother and eldest sister.  So I took the Cathay Pacific Airlines with a stopover\
  \ in Bangkok and whew it was a long journey before I set foot in Narita Airport!\
  \  Luckily I got on the right train and caught the last trip for another train I\
  \ transferred to before I reached my sister\u2019s home.  \n \nSo for the first\
  \ day went to Sumida Park first before Sensoji temple in Asakusa which is one of\
  \ the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo and ate the most delicious Ramen I\u2019ve\
  \ ever tasted The following 10 days, I\u2019ve tried as much as possible to visit\
  \ the famous spots in Tokyo together with my son.  The days came fast juggling between\
  \ going to places and spending a day just at home relaxing. Armed with a tablet\
  \ and sim with mobile data we visited Ueno and Shibuya on the following days and\
  \ celebrated my 40th birthday for a whole day in Disney Sea with my son.  I felt\
  \ like a kid again especially when we experienced the fireworks as the finale event.\
  \ Next days we visited Odaiba, Ginza, Shinjuku and Yoyogi.  We already had used\
  \ to the subways and how the life is going there.  So we almost always prevent rush\
  \ hour when commuting because the subway was always busy.  \n \nAnd then we were\
  \ ready for Kyoto!  We took a night bus going there so we could save a night for\
  \ the hotel as we don\u2019t have any relatives to come home to there.  The travel\
  \ from Tokyo to Kyoto is 6 hours. For two days we visited Golden Pavillion, Kiyomizudera,\
  \ Ashamiya, Sagano, Sanjusangendo, Gion District and Fushimi Inari. We are so amazed\
  \ with the Golden Temple and I couldn\u2019t look away from it as if it has a magnetic\
  \ force asking you to come near to it. \n \nAfter experiencing Kyoto, we headed\
  \ to Osaka where my cousin and her daughter is residing.  We took a train which\
  \ was almost 4 hour ride before we arrived in the station near their home.  The\
  \ following day we went to Universal Studio where again I lost my age and had fun\
  \ with the Minions and all the so much fun rides there.  Though we didn\u2019t understand\
  \ (everything is in their local language!) we still managed to put a smile on our\
  \ face, after all, happiness is always in universal language! The following two\
  \ days we visited Osaka Castle, Namba and Umeda. We took a bus again going back\
  \ to Tokyo and arrived almost midnight. We went to Sky Tree to experience the sunset\
  \ over the whole city of Tokyo as our final and last destination before I went back\
  \ to Dubai again.  .  And voila! I just found myself in the airport heading to Dubai\
  \ which signals the vacation is over.\n \nTo wrap it up. I can say Japan is a one\
  \ stop shop when it comes to touristing. Ancient temples, rare animals, weirdest\
  \ items, variety of delicious food, rich culture, awesome nature, challenging subways,\
  \ newest technologies, modern inventions and the list go on.  But you know what\
  \ stayed in my heart? It's the people of Japan! I didn't expect them to be so good\
  \ in being human! The most mindful, helpful, cheerful, resourceful, industrious,\
  \ honest, humble, courteous, disciplined ...(and still a long list of good adjectives\
  \ for them) I've felt so safe as a tourist dealing with them.  I guess apart from\
  \ what their country can offer for the tourist to visit, their local people is the\
  \ best thing ever a tourist will love if they visit Japan.  We can learn so much\
  \ about being Japanese.  There's no wonder their country is one of the best right\
  \ now.  I guess it's what truly makes a country so beautiful! And I\u2019m planning\
  \ to spend another vacation there soon!"
