Text: "I never understood Gabriel Garc\xEDa M\xE1rquez\u2019s literature. Despite\
  \ several failed attempts at reading his internationally acclaimed novels, I struggled\
  \ to grasp the concept of magical realism. In my sceptical European brain, things\
  \ were either magical, or real, but I always saw the combination of both as an arranged\
  \ marriage set for failure. Until I visited the north of Colombia.\n\nAfter two\
  \ months of strenuous trekking in the Peruvian Andes, I planned to culminate my\
  \ ten-week South American stint relaxing on the coast of Cartagena de Indias. Although\
  \ it was a transformational trip, I was feeling slightly disappointed about leaving\
  \ this continent without having bonded with Pachamama, our beloved -but often forgotten-\
  \ mother earth. It was a selling factor in most travel guides, locals mentioned\
  \ it daily, and hippie travellers swore by it. Full of excitement, I immersed myself\
  \ into the spectacular scenery of Peru with the hope of finding an intimate connection\
  \ between the universe and my inner self. I spent several weeks in the Sacred Valley.\
  \ I walked the Inka trail to Machu Picchu.  I hiked the Colca Canyon. Every single\
  \ trek rewarded me with an intense physical challenge and mind-blowing pictures;\
  \ however, not even the slightest trace of mysticism along the way. At that point,\
  \ I decided to be true to myself and stopped searching. Let\u2019s face it, Natalia,\
  \ you are a city girl! You feel more at home strolling along the concrete jungle\
  \ in polluted Lima than hiking the majestic Peruvian mountains. \n\nAnd I am also\
  \ a beach bum, so Cartagena seemed like a good compromise for my last days. This\
  \ vibrant city captivated me instantly. Colourful colonial architecture, people\u2019\
  s strong sexual energy, incessant street parties... My first day in Colombia brought\
  \ me a wealth of new exciting experiences: I danced to the sensual rhythms of champeta,\
  \ I ate new delicious tropical fruits, and participated in a two hundred people\
  \ zumba convention. However, my researcher instinct led me to more tempting, off\
  \ the beaten track adventures. An article on a Spanish traveller\u2019s blog seduced\
  \ me to buy a one-way boat ticket to the Rosario Islands National Park. Following\
  \ his recommendations, I also booked myself a single room in an arty eco-hotel with\
  \ no running water, electricity or internet at Isla Grande, the biggest island of\
  \ that archipelago. Isla Grande was, ironically, quite small. Within a few days,\
  \ I had explored the entire verdant rainforest, swum in the pristine waters of every\
  \ beach, become friends with most islanders, and done all the typical touristy activities\
  \ that were on offer. After sunset, the whole island switched off and went to sleep.\
  \ By eight o\u2019clock -maybe eight thirty- I was usually in bed, except for my\
  \ last night.  \n\nThat night, I experienced one of the most enlightening \u2018\
  aha moments\u2019 of my life. As I was walking amidst the lush vegetation back to\
  \ my lovely eco-room, something extraordinary happened. The island was pitch-black\
  \ and silent; the only sound I could hear was the crickets chirping, maybe a random\
  \ bird. My mobile was flat and I had left my head torch on my bedside table. I stopped\
  \ and froze for several seconds. I was scared. I kept walking and tried not to panic\
  \ as it was barely a ten-minute walk. Suddenly, the way became less leafy and much\
  \ brighter. I stopped and looked up at the sky to notice a scintillating moon accompanied\
  \ by a zillion stars. I breathed deeply. I looked around. I breathed again. Next,\
  \ I closed my eyes to feel the island with the rest of my senses. And then, it clicked.\
  \ This was what Garc\xEDa M\xE1rquez wrote about: the wildness, Macondo, the Buend\xED\
  a family, the magic! And yet how real! I was on the other side of the world, on\
  \ a tiny island in the middle of the Caribbean where I could sense a real spark\
  \ of ineffable magic. I finally understood it! In that moment, I felt the pure energy\
  \ from the earth, the sky, the water, a connection with the nature that can only\
  \ be explained with tears of happiness, and a long-lasting friend\xB4s hug. An overwhelming\
  \ feeling of gratitude invaded me and penetrated my soul. Pachamama revealed to\
  \ me in the least expected place\u2026 Colombia!"
