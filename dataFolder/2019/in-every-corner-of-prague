Text: "I read in some book,  lost on the shelf, about the beauties of a city in which\
  \ the tips of the cathedral touched the clouds, and the red roofs contrasted with\
  \ the blue sky above my head. I also read about the cobbled streets that stretched\
  \ over the bridges, reflecting the sky on sunny afternoons, and also on the hidden\
  \ bars that sheltered those who were cold. It was a book of romance that I can not\
  \ even remember the name, but I remember that within this common pages I fell in\
  \ love with a city, a place in the world that I needed to know, Prague.\nI crossed\
  \ an ocean to get there, so that I could feel the icy wind of the Czech Republic\
  \ winter cutting my face, and the wet streets of the rainy day that received me\
  \ in the country. The first morning was like a painting, the orange sky reflected\
  \ in the puddles that crowded my way as I walked through the center to meet Orloj,\
  \ the astrological clock. Some disappointments sometimes happen, are those stories\
  \ that I will tell later, but I met this famous tourist spot through a photograph,\
  \ hanging on top of the building that was under construction, but even so it was\
  \ possible to climb to the belvedere to appreciate the city above my feet, seeing\
  \ where each corner met the other, and where so many people, so small, exchanged\
  \ their daily conversations for little amenities. I climbed each step anxious for\
  \ the top. The glass elevator staring at me, asking me to take a ride, but the experience\
  \ of climbing each staircase, taking enjoying the clear walls and wood floor, observing\
  \ people who spoke in a language I do not know ,living their normal day, was more\
  \ charming.\nI drank the famous Pilsner Urquell in the Old Town Square, next to\
  \ the flaming heaters that are placed in the outdoor areas of restaurants, to keep\
  \ everyone warm. I also ate a wonderful typical dish, a fried cheese with French\
  \ fries called Sma\u017Een\xFD s\xFDr, I confess that the pronunciation was a littledifficult,\
  \ in a small restaurant, found around a corner, with a whole wall of windows, that\
  \ showed the yellowish and cozy light of the place.\nI did not spend much time in\
  \ this charming city, only two days, but it was enough to mark in my memory, from\
  \ the long street that I had walked to the subway, the search for some exchange\
  \ that was still open late at night to exchange real for koruna, to the marvelous\
  \ nuts found in street fairs. \nI keep all these details with me, waiting for the\
  \ next opportunity to return."
