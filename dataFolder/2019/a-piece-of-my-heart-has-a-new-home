Text: "There are many different types of travel. Each of us probably has a different\
  \ idea about it and mine is that a trip is like climbing a mountain: it has several\
  \ stages and it is a process that evolves little by little and then reflects within\
  \ us. For a lover of everything that is new like me, almost everything can turn\
  \ into a journey, especially when it changes something inside me. So far, the best\
  \ journey I've had in my life has been my time abroad in Germany, also called Erasmus.\n\
  I arrived in Eichst\xE4tt in March, a city that at the time I saw small and boring\
  \ but, when it came time to leave, it seemed to me the most beautiful place in the\
  \ world. It is not true that the places are always the same, they change constantly\
  \ because our point of view changes. So, from one moment to another, a road can\
  \ take on an emotional value only because we walked it on a happy day. We will always\
  \ remember that pathway as a happy place, even if at the beginning it was just a\
  \ street.\nSo, day after day, a small university town in southern Germany, situated\
  \ between two valleys, crossed by a river and surrounded by trees, became my home.\
  \ There I left a piece of my heart, which I will find every time I return. I saw\
  \ all those trees, first white because of the snow, that change color every month.\
  \ I saw the flowers bloom and fill the city with an indescribable scent. I saw the\
  \ faces of the brightest people with the arrival of summer and then the leaves fall\
  \ as if it were the rightest thing to do. I have seen this city full and empty,\
  \ in all shades, and I have learned to love it deeply.\nI learned to get to know\
  \ the Germans and understand what was true and what was absurd about stereotypes.\
  \ I started to enjoy breakfast with W\xFCrst and Beer, even if before I felt bad\
  \ just thinking about it. I walked through the woods at night with torches and listened\
  \ to stories of witch hunts. I walked in the woods even during the day, realizing\
  \ a dream I had long had. I discovered that I loved nature and I started walking\
  \ more because I noticed that it brought me serenity. In the hills, for example,\
  \ I found the place that gives me the feeling of inner peace. There is my most beautiful\
  \ memory, running laughing down the hill, totally carefree and with a heart full\
  \ of joy. I felt like a child and at the same time it seemed to me that the whole\
  \ world was mine. I learned to greet people on the street, even if I don't know\
  \ them, and I realized that it's something that makes you feel good. I walked in\
  \ the frozen river at night during a Pub Crawl and I liked it.\nI cooked for people\
  \ from other countries who then in their turn cooked for me new dishes, never seen\
  \ before. I learned a lot of new things from other countries and cultures that I\
  \ would otherwise never have discovered. I have learned to listen to people and\
  \ to tell even trivial stories because when it comes to diversity the trivial becomes\
  \ fundamental.\nI have grown so much during this journey that I don't even recognize\
  \ myself anymore. Getting out of your comfort zone can be scary at first but then,\
  \ when you start breathing the scent of freedom you can no longer stop and it scares\
  \ more to return to those rigid patterns of routine.\nThe most beautiful trips are\
  \ those where we find ourselves."
