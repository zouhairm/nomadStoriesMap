Text: "I had heard a lot about Syrian refugees, but I had never actually met one.\
  \ At least until that night. Ali had arrived in Sweden eight months ago. He didn\u2019\
  t speak a single word of English back then, but when Sophie, my boss, introduced\
  \ him to me, he had learned enough of the language to tell me his story. \n\nWe\
  \ were gathered around the fire, roasting some Swedish herring and drinking beer.\
  \ All of us, except Ali, of course. It was Ramadan season and the sun hadn\u2019\
  t set yet, so he was just contemplating our improvised barbeque with curious eyes.\
  \ \u201CAre you sure you don\u2019t want a small bite?\u201D, asked Anna, the Polish\
  \ receptionist of the Inn where Ali and I worked, but he politely declined the offer.\
  \ Anna shrugged. \u201CI could never go that long without eating\u201D, she said.\
  \ For a moment, I was afraid that he would take offense on her words, but Ali just\
  \ smiled. \u201CNot eating tastes like home\u201D, he said. \n\nIt was a cold evening.\
  \ The red windmills were spinning with the breeze of the ocean and we could see\
  \ a couple of badgers and a deer at the edge of the forest. I had never been to\
  \ Syria before, but I couldn\u2019t imagine a place that would be more different\
  \ from it than \xD6land. \n\nI asked Ali if he still remembered his country and\
  \ he said he did. Forgetting was the hard part. \n\nHis arms still carried the scars\
  \ the police had caused him during their last encounter, right before he was forced\
  \ to leave his family behind and seek asylum on the other side of the world. Even\
  \ if we had spoken the same tongue, I don\u2019t think I would have found the right\
  \ words to comfort him, so I lifted my sleeve and showed him a burn mark I had on\
  \ my wrist. I had gotten it while I was baking cookies with my mother, a night before\
  \ saying goodbye to her and boarding a plane to Europe. Our stories were very different,\
  \ of course, but the feeling was the same. I also missed home. \n\nThe night finally\
  \ came as we sat down quietly, away from the cheerful crowd. After a while, I stood\
  \ up and brought him a plate of fish and vegetables that he began eating slowly.\
  \ We didn\u2019t say much the rest of the night, but words weren\u2019t really necessary.\
  \ Neither of us was native English speakers, but, sometimes, I guess nostalgia is\
  \ a universal language."
