Text: "Being a resident of Landikotal, A tribal district of Pakistan. it is very hard\
  \ for me to select some historical and concern issues of my area. in this development\
  \ world still we dont have access to the basic rights like Education, Good Health,\
  \ food, and modern facilities like electricity and access to the internet.. the\
  \ people of this area is very talented and hard worker. i left my country in February\
  \ 14,2018 to find the best solution for those social issues. i started my journey\
  \ as volunteer from Pakistan to Colombia, to Ecuador and then to Mexico. I am finding\
  \ the way that how the Latin countries improves their Education sector and achieved\
  \ modern facilities. \n\nI did master in social anthropology which deals with the\
  \ study of culture and relationship among people. I have been studied and observed\
  \ different cultures, such as I belong from pukhtoon society so I know the norms,\
  \ customs, and tradition of pukhtoon culture. And I can easily implement project\
  \ or program over there. For successful project it is necessary that we should work\
  \ according to the need of people of that area. Besides that I know about research\
  \ methodology including different steps of research. If government or nongovernmental\
  \ organization gives me a chance   to implement some projects or programs in education\
  \ sectors INSHALLAH I will show myself and my ability there. I am going to write\
  \ a quote of Quaid Azam Muhammad ali Jinnah he said \u201Cwork, work and work\u201D\
  \ if some want really to implement a project in the field. Without doubt one day\
  \ he will do it. In short I am interested to improve the level of education and\
  \ should acquire basic facilities. Moreover now each and every one wants to grant\
  \ facilities for themselves, however without education it is unfeasible. Literally\
  \ education is giving us doctors, engineers, professors, social scientist, and officers.\
  \  And they are giving services while engaging in different fields. That\u2019s\
  \ why I want to improve the quality of education for both genders. And should motivate/aware\
  \ them about the importance of education. Although I want to see the pencil and\
  \ books in the hand child labor, hotel workers etc. really sometime I am thinking\
  \ that surly one day my hope will be practical. So literate people are thinking\
  \ positively for their country, and he/she wants to do something for the welfare\
  \ of human being. In conclusion if someone wants to talk about education and it\u2019\
  s spreading, so how can people go against that."
