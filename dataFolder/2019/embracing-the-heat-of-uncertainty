Text: "One hour in and I was full of regret.\n\n\u201CWe should have NEVER LEFT!\u201D\
  \n\nThe sun was bearing down on the three of us.  Just past high noon in the middle\
  \ of the Yucat\xE1n, we were stuck with the peak heat of midday, much like our sweat-soaked\
  \ shirts were stuck to our midbacks. \n\nA mile of off beaten jungle trail and another\
  \ two miles of paved road already traversed, our 750 mL water bottles were dwindling\
  \ down to the last few sips.  Three feet of bushy grass and then tropical moist\
  \ forest covered either side of the road, but it did little to provide us any shade\
  \ with the sun directly overhead. \n\nBehind us, we could hear another car approaching.\
  \  Hope once again resurfaced, and we stuck out our thumbs.  A small white sedan,\
  \ dust billowing behind it, showed no signs of slowing down.  Full of despair, my\
  \ arm was by my side before it managed to pass by. \n\nThree days into our international\
  \ expedition, we were anxious to mingle with locals, most likely Mayans, as Yucat\xE1\
  n has one of the highest percentages of indigenous people of the 31 Mexican States.\
  \  We skipped the afternoon siesta and set out from the farm with hopes to hitchhike\
  \ to the nearest city, Libre Union, approximately eight miles away in one of the\
  \ least hospitable and most humid climates in the world.\n\nSnapping back into our\
  \ present predicament, I couldn\u2019t believe we were going to walk the entire\
  \ way. \n\n\u201CWe have to visualize it.\u201D\n\nFighting back a complete mental\
  \ breakdown, I was picturing a small pickup truck stopping just ahead of us.\n\n\
  Several minutes pass, sweat beads running down our faces.  Behind us, through the\
  \ hazy horizon, we hear another car approaching.\n\nThere was no hesitation at this\
  \ point with the hitchhiking.  Thumbs were out, arms fully extended.  Once it became\
  \ within clear eyesight, I saw that it was a small red pickup flying towards us.\
  \ \n\nVROOMMMM!\n\nAnother one right past us.  \n\nJust as we\u2019d given up on\
  \ the truck, we see its brake lights off in the distance.  Filled with elation we\
  \ hurried towards the pickup.  Excitement building, a hint of relief, along with\
  \ uncertainty and restraint as we have no idea what\u2019s next.\n\nBack windows\
  \ were fully tinted with bright red lettering to match the truck.  Must have been\
  \ Mayan because we couldn\u2019t comprehend the words.\n\n\u201CHow do we ask for\
  \ a ride?\u201D  Panic peaking as the truck was a few strides away.\n\nOnly one\
  \ of us spoke more than \u2018un poco\u2019 Spanish.  They had little room for negotiation\
  \ on who would speak first.\n\n\u201C\xBFDonde estan las mamasitas?\u201D \n\nAfter\
  \ noticing the guy\u2019s aviators and a Dallas Cowboys sticker on the back, we\
  \ were feeling festive and maybe a little delirious from the heat.\n\nThe mood immediately\
  \ became more relaxed, and we bantered a bit in Spanish.\n\nThe driver, named Alvar,\
  \ eager to display his English, \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\n\nWe learn that\
  \ Alvar had worked most of his life in Dallas and returned to Mexico to enjoy retirement.\
  \  Alvar\u2019s nephew and another man who worked on his farm in the back, both\
  \ around eighteen.  Assuming they didn\u2019t speak English, they did not give us\
  \ much of a warm welcome.\n\nBefore Alvar could finish offering us a spot in the\
  \ bed of the truck, we were hopping in.  A bit crowded with a big cooler, tire,\
  \ and tools.   \n\nFlying down the road now, embracing the wind as it cleared our\
  \ faces of sweat.\n\nLooking ahead and trying not to be alarmed of our newfound\
  \ friend coming to a slow stop.  With no town in sight, fear had us frozen. \n\n\
  \u201CWhy are we stopping?\u201D\n\nFeelings quickly turned to apprehension as the\
  \ nephew got out of the passenger side, displaying his brute strength and face tattoo.\n\
  \nSeconds later, Alvar stepped out of the driver side, \u201CCERVEZA TIME!!!\u201D\
  \n\nAgain, we lit up with excitement and relief.  Alvar popped open the cooler to\
  \ display over 40 8 oz bottles of Sol being cooled by one giant ice block.\n\nI\
  \ seldom enjoy the taste of beer, but that first sip of ice-cold Sol hitting my\
  \ mouth brought the biggest smile across my face."
