Text: "When I told my Argentinian friends about going to El Calafate for a couple\
  \ of days every single one of them told me that I have to take a day to visit El\
  \ Chalten and hike to one of the mountain peaks. Without questioning it and I booked\
  \ a day trip to see the magical and mysterious Mount Fitz Roy. Even though the hike\
  \ was difficult to complete and I was a novice hiker, I decided to take a bullet\
  \ and try to climb the 12 km beast in just 8 hours. \nThe two-hour drive to El Chalten\
  \ was peaceful, the skies were completely clear promising a vibrant view of mountain\
  \ peaks. I was stunned by magnificent Patagonian landscapes that appeared to be\
  \ completely lifeless and deserted at first until the eye began to see the movement\
  \ in every corner; wild lamas, foxes, Patagonian maras were everywhere! Little did\
  \ I knew that it wasn\u2019t the only surprize this trip is going to bring\u2026\
  \nThe first 8 kilometres of the hike went by like a breeze, full of sunshine and\
  \ stunning view of mountains, rivers, and lagunas, until the winds picked up bringing\
  \ clouds and icy cold rain. My jeans started to get soaked with every raindrop and\
  \ the thought of turning around crawled into my consciousness drumming constantly\
  \ that I won\u2019t be able to reach the top anyway. Ignoring its rumbling noise,\
  \ I put on the hood, zipped up the jacket and remained on course.\nFive hours were\
  \ left when I reached the last kilometer of the trek. All of the sudden the trail\
  \ changed from a pleasant valley pathway to stairway going up 400 meters. I gazed\
  \ up \u2013 walking up the stairs was far from being my favourite activity but turning\
  \ around was not even an option. Taking giant steps, one after another one, I was\
  \ completely focused on conquering the last stretch. \nThe grim weather was intensifying.\
  \ The wind was determined to blow off the hood, the rain turned into ice projectiles\
  \ shooting my face. The knees started to shake with every stride. I was gasping\
  \ for air and I was failing mentally. \u201CWhy? Why am I doing this to myself?\u201D\
  \ I started questioning everything: my values, my goals and my abilities. I was\
  \ losing the confidence in who I am. The childhood memories of the moments when\
  \ I felt completely lost, ashamed and not knowing what to do rushed through my head\
  \ making me feel defenseless. \n\u201CJust stop for a second and take a breath\u201D\
  \ I heard a quiet, confident voice.\nI halted. I lifted my eyes from the rocks on\
  \ the trail and then I saw it\u2026 I was completely hypnotized by the view. The\
  \ horrifying weather was in pure contrast with the perfect backdrop views of rivers,\
  \ lagunas and mountains. \u201CThis is the reason!\u201D I said to myself. I was\
  \ surrounded by nature\u2019s beauty, vastness and power. All of the sudden the\
  \ weather was not horrible anymore. With all my senses I was watching a fun game\
  \ that winds were playing with the rain and clouds like little children enjoying\
  \ a ball game on a playground. A feeling of gratitude and happiness flooded my whole\
  \ existence. Everything was just perfect! Nowhere else, in no other point in time\
  \ I would be able to discover the love and joy of mountain hiking with the same\
  \ passion as that moment. I felt a flow of intense energy spreading through my veins\
  \ as I looked up again and a proud smile stretched from the corners of my mouth.\
  \ \nLater, sitting in the car and feeling completely exhausted, I was continuously\
  \ replaying the experience in my head. I was rejoiced and content: I walked out\
  \ of the nature\u2019s furiousity with a confidence in my inner strength. I left\
  \ El Chalten knowing that no matter how loud discouraging thoughts could get and\
  \ no matter how difficult or scary surroundings may be, always there will be a light\
  \ motivating to go on. And mountains became my light."
