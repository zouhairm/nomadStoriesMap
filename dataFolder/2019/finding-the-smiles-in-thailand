Text: "I definitely didn't want to go to Thailand. When Rob called me about the holiday,\
  \ I tried to convince him to go anywhere but Thailand until he snapped at me with\
  \ that disdainful tone you only get to use with friends you\u2019ve known for 20\
  \ years. \u201CShut up, Kevin! The ticket to Bangkok was cheap. I have 7 days in\
  \ the country, so find somewhere close and tell me where we are going!\u201D. \n\
  \n\u201CSo\u201D, I told my girlfriend, Alice,  after hanging up, \u201CI guess\
  \ we\u2019re going to Thailand.\u201D \n\nI had been to Thailand in 2010, to Bangkok\
  \ and then south. But something felt off. It was the feeling of being on a Tourist\
  \ Travellator. Like in an airport where you are heading to customs and they have\
  \ posters of all the wonderful and weird places you can visit. And we did. The floating\
  \ market, Khoi San Road, Wat Pho, street food stalls, food poisoning, Soi Cowboy,\
  \ sleeper trains, ferries, seasickness, Koh Phangan, a Full-moon party, a beach\
  \ bungalow.\n\nBut everywhere I went I was one of many. Flotsam in a steady stream\
  \ of flip-flops, tanned tattoos, Chang vests, backpacks, sunglasses and the ubiquitous\
  \ baggy pants. It was like being in a museum, looking at a \u201CThai Holiday Exhibition\u201D\
  . And to those being looked at, I was an indistinguishable part of the never-ending\
  \ stream of gawkers, flush with fresh Facebook content. The interactions felt transactional:\
  \ Culture for cash, selfies for sale. It disappointed, and so I wrote off the whole\
  \ country.\n\nAnd, yet, the Mae Hong Son loop from Chiang Mai changed everything.\
  \ It\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so special, so memorable. The\
  \ thrill of driving the road on our 125CC beasts was a major part of it. A road\
  \ that dips and climbs and winds its way through 1865 turns, an embarrassing number\
  \ of which left me whooping into my helmet at the picture-perfect scene. \n\nThe\
  \ tree-lined straights stretching into mist or another turn. The weathered faces\
  \ of farmers on their dusty old motorbikes transporting all manner of goods and\
  \ a dog to or from the market or the fields. The monks crossing a bridge at first\
  \ light, their bright orange robes the only splash of color in the black and white\
  \ landscape. The majesty of the mountains beyond mountains that reveal themselves\
  \ as you burst through the trees into the sunlight. The immense Asian Redwood trees\
  \ that tower over the road, providing cool pools of shade. The tropical curtain\
  \ that hems the road, a kaleidoscope of greens which, occasionally parts to give\
  \ a glimpse of life in these hills. Rice fields ploughed by oxen, hewed by hand\
  \ in the hot sun, bow-legged bamboo shelters tucked under trees for a shady spot\
  \ to wait for the heat to pass.\n\nThe unassuming, open-air, riverside bar in Mae\
  \ Sariang that had an incredible assortment of things from barber chairs to a North\
  \ Korean Army Officer\u2019s hat. The roadside shops, a short dusty walk from the\
  \ tarmac that all feature bright or formerly-bright-now-sun-bleached-almost-white\
  \ banners for ice cream, or a cellphone company, or soap, or washing powder, or\
  \ cola. The calm of the Mae Hong Son night market which wraps itself around a still\
  \ lake in the middle of town, in which is perfectly reflected the twinkling lights\
  \ and brilliant white of the temple's stupa.\n\nAnd the people. The teenage monk\
  \ who wanted a selfie with us, while we were standing and looking out at the \u2018\
  famous\u2019 sunset. The bar owner who told us she was tired and didn\u2019t want\
  \ to cook, but directed us to her favorite restaurant in town and wrote down what\
  \ we should order. The man who we happened to sit next to and laughed at us as we\
  \ bit into our food and were surprised by the spiciness. He taught us how to say\
  \ \u201CNot spicy, please\u201D, in Thai, and we're now friends. Or the young girls\
  \ in traditional Thai garb doing photoshoots with their moms in a tiny old-style\
  \ wooden temple.\n\nThe \"Land of Smiles\" moniker is now understood. The return\
  \ trip is planned. The word has been spread: we know a place, where the people are\
  \ as beautiful as the backdrop."
