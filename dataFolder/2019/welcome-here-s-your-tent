Text: "I had never been able to travel alone, but I really wanted to go to Germany,\
  \ and to be extremely sincere, there was a really cheap flight that I had to take\
  \ advantage of, so in spite o mi fears I decided to go by my own. Clearly destiny\
  \ doesn\xB4t like to see me so lonely and to my grateful surprise my best friend\
  \ Bryan was that exact day in Berl\xEDn doing the same as me, trying to survive\
  \ (no talking to anyone) by his own. \nThe day I arrived to Berl\xEDn it was really\
  \ hot but mind blowing, we loved the city, walked hundreds of kilometers, and had\
  \ so much fun trying to talk to germans just to find a Mc Donalds. \nIt was almost\
  \ 6 pm and we realized we didn\xB4t have a place to sleep that night, once again\
  \ the bad habit of leaving things for the last minute took us to get mad, we called\
  \ every single hostel in the center but they were all full, we walked the whole\
  \  city again and nothing. The night came and with that hunger, slumber and fatigue\
  \ and we started to get tired of each other, blaming the other for being so irresponsible.\
  \ We stopped in a turkish restaurant to have something to eat and asked some people\
  \ there if they knew a place we could rest that night, a man told us that near there\
  \ was a Hostel, he was not sure if we were going to like it, but for that moment\
  \ we were prepared a ready to accept anything just for a shower and a bed. \nWe\
  \ called this place and fortunately the had few tents free, I was so sleppy by that\
  \ time that I thought I probably heard wrong and it was not the word \"TENT\", so\
  \ we walked to the adress that appeared in google maps and we found something we\
  \ had never seen before.  \nMaybe I am being exaggerated and for Berlin people this\
  \ is the most common place to stay for a night, but to me was the rarest experience,\
  \ so, we got to a kind of big park, it looked more like a forest because it was\
  \ all surounded by trees, when we arrived the nice girl in the reception said, \"\
  Welcome, in a minute i\xB4m going to take you to your tent\", yes, I thought, she\
  \ just said tent.  \nWe saw a tent in the middle of the park, there were about 10\
  \ tents more in that place, and people sleeping there, I thought that maybe that\
  \ was a joke, a tent in the middle of a huge city full of the most expensive and\
  \ luxurious hotels, that was not everything, by the reception there was a space\
  \ for recreation, and by recreation I mean that there were many people for many\
  \ countries ( I had never seen so many diverse people so united in one place) there\
  \ were africans, asian people, europeans and us, south americans, they were all\
  \ playing cards, drinking beer, playing ping-pong, dancing with the music out loud,\
  \ others were setting a bonfire for later that night. We thought that the tent was\
  \ too small for two people but we really wanted to stay there, so we asked the receptionist\
  \ for a bigger tent, she said there was no more tents but she had a room for two,\
  \ the room was twice expensive that it was the tent, but we didn\xB4t care, we needed\
  \ to spent the night in that funny place. That night was awesome, we made some african\
  \ friends, we danced with them and had the most unexpeccted moments in that forest\
  \ hostel. \n\nWhat I try to say is how astonished I am when I live this kind of\
  \ things, I\xB4ve always had the luck of finding the most weird things when I go\
  \ on a trip, is never the same experience, and most of that things comes from my\
  \ lack of organization and money and facilities, but if you, like me, think that\
  \ don\xB4t have what is neccesary, just take the decision, everything else will\
  \ come as you enjoy, there is many wonderfull people out there, nothing bad is gonna\
  \ happen."
