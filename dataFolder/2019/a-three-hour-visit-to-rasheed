Text: "I had been to Rasheed,  or 'Rosetta'. That was because of a story I admired\
  \ since my childhood. I will tell you more about that,  but first let me tell you\
  \ more about Rasheed. \nRasheed is the place where Rosetta stone was found and revealed\
  \ a lot about the Ancient Egyptians' civilization. Its importance wasn't only for\
  \ finding Rosetta stone. It was a connection between east and west which cultivated\
  \ commerce and connections among nations. It lies on the northern border of Egypt\
  \ . That made it a critical point to protect. You could visit 'Qaietbai'  castle\
  \ by the Mediterranean Sea when you get there. \nHistorically, it witnessed a lot\
  \ of ages: Pharaonic, Roman, and Islamic. For the modern history, it was said that\
  \ the courage of Rasheed's people was the cause behind the failure of Fraizer Campaign.\
  \ \nBack to my beloved story, it is 'Ghadat Rasheed' by Ali Al Garem. It tells about\
  \ the city at the time of French Occupation of Egypt through insights into the life\
  \ of 'Zubaidah', the beautiful Egyptian lady who was married to General Meno,  the\
  \ third man of the French Campaign. It mentions 'Othman Agha', the governor of Rasheed\
  \ at that time. The story contained a description to the city streets and houses,\
  \ surprisingly, very familiar despite of the long time. One of the mentioned houses\
  \ was 'El Amseely'  which was built by Othman Agha.  It contains a flour mill and\
  \ three houses, connected by inside stairs. One of the houses was given to the chief\
  \ of the maids. The houses were built based on Islamic style.  They are well conditioned\
  \ through high ceilings and windows. The houses' design respects human needs of\
  \ privacy in that era.  One example for this is a special window designed for women\
  \ to hand things to the guest room so that she wouldn't be seen if there are any\
  \ strangers. It is called 'Shobbak El Menawlah'.  It felt great to see places where\
  \ characters I was attached to through pages actually lived. \nLater I went to 'Tal\
  \ Abo Mandour' and its mosque. The mosque is historical and is open for prayer.\
  \ Outside the mosque, on the hill it was built on,  people lived simply. Families\
  \ gathered, kids played,  and people tried to catch fish by the riverside. \nPeople\
  \ of Rasheed live within history. Rasheed is like an open museum. There are many\
  \ other historical places and most of them could be visited by merely a walk. I\
  \ could easily find my way to Rasheed museum where I found plenty of interesting\
  \ things from which I mention a copy of Rosetta stone and the original marriage\
  \ certificate of Zubaidah."
