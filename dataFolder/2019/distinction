Text: "It was thirty plus years ago.  I was perusing Travel Brochures (the days before\
  \ Internet) seeking destinations of Sun, Sand, Beach, Palm Trees and Ocean Views.\
  \  It was a dream I longed to turn into adventure, experience and relaxation.  I\
  \ had narrowed down my choices and was getting ready to book my epic vacation. \
  \ Then the unthinkable...what about a Desert vacation?!  What?!!!  Are you crazy?!\
  \  How could something like that ever be noteworthy.  I wanted an adventure to remember;\
  \ something to talk about for years to come.  I needed my Beach and Ocean Views...How\
  \ could this live up to what my thoughts and dreams were filled with?  Wouldn't\
  \ this be settling; not fighting for My Hopes, My Dreams, My Desires?  \n\nI had\
  \ to sleep and reflect on this idea.  Maybe I could compromise. I would be able\
  \ to leave sooner; not wait another six to eight months.  Perhaps I could stay longer;\
  \ that would mean more days of rest and relaxation.  Definitely would assist the\
  \ budget; money could be spent on the frivolous.  Okay, I can do this.  So began\
  \ the arrangements...\n\nFinal boarding call Canada 3000 to Palm Springs, California.\
  \  Please make your way to Gate 3.  The Day had arrived...Through the Gate we departed\
  \ and entered the plane.  We were off to adventure.  The flight was smooth skies\
  \ and then Palm Springs was below us.  What a surreal ariel!  Completely surrounded\
  \ by mountains.  (I later learned this region is the Coachella Valley.)  From the\
  \ moment we landed on the tarmac and walked off the plane I began my love affair.\n\
  \nWhat a glorious place we had chosen.  The architecture, desert colours, sunsets,\
  \ manicured golf courses and my beautiful Palm Trees!!  A fabulous destination indeed.\
  \  In reality everything was exactly as I had dreamt.  It was the differences that\
  \ I was genuinely seeking.  Not the  similarity of home.  How had I forgotten...I\
  \ live at an Ocean city with Beaches.  So though I believed I was seeking Sun, Sand,\
  \ Beach, Ocean Views and Palm Trees; I actually was craving Palm Trees and major\
  \ sunshine.  Palm Springs has been a light of my life ever since.  It holds amazing\
  \ memories and stories.  It is a place that puts a sparkle in my eye.  Palm Springs\
  \ I never knew I needed you!!"
