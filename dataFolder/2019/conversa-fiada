Text: "Conversa Fiada\n\nI truly hate small talk. The idea of starting a conversation\
  \ talking about the rain, the sun, the weather in general: \u201COh, it is cloudy\
  \ today?\u201D; \u201CThe sun is up in the sky, lovely\u201D. I am really not up\
  \ for those sentences. To me the idea of small talk makes me feel awkward. But,\
  \ my grandmother has a very nice way to say \u201Csmall talk\u201D in Brazilian\
  \ portugueses, it is: \u201Cconversa fiada\u201D. However, the concept of my grandmother\
  \ vocabulary it\u2019s not quite the same as the anglofone one, because \u201Cconversa\
  \ fiada\u201D it\u2019s not chatting about the weather and starting little conversations\
  \ just to be polite or to pass the time. The idea of \u201Cconversa fiada\u201D\
  \ it\u2019s best defined by the act of talking about any topic, complex or not,\
  \ without any aim to bond, or even being polite. Still, it\u2019s not unusual for\
  \ the \u201Csmall talkers\u201D that profit from this technique to be surprised\
  \ by new connections, perspectives, experiencias and ideas.\nThere is one kind of\
  \ small talk that I hate the most, and it is the case of when you are so deeply\
  \ fatigued from a intense travel and you just want silence and peace till you get\
  \ home, but for some reason, someone starts a conversation with you. There are some\
  \ taxi drivers that are unable to understand this stressful situation, and I am\
  \ very thankful for all of those guys, because, you see, I happen to have a lovely\
  \ experience in one of this moments when I was being drove by a taxi driver that\
  \ loves chatting.\nIt was my last day in Buenos Aires, after exploring Belgrano,\
  \ Palermo and Recoleta, to the extreme.  I sense that I have a better perception\
  \ traveling when I have the chance to walk around the town, so by the end of the\
  \ trip I couldn't even feel my legs, all my body was hurting and I was so tired\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t possibly be polite and nice, I just wanted to go home to\
  \ rest. But my taxi driver was in another mood, and, to be fair, it was his car\
  \ so I kind had to dance by the tune.\n\u201CBrasileiro?\u201D Asked him with that\
  \ charming Argentinian accent pronouncing Portuguese words. I told him I was from\
  \ the extreme south, almost Uruguay. And than he goes: \u201Cfutebol?\u201D. I answered\
  \ him I am not that much into sports in general, but I knew that Brazil was facing\
  \ a very hard time in football issues, and also a very problematic political, economical\
  \ and social moment. \n\u201CPor algo somos hermanos\u201D, said him. Which translates\
  \ as \u201Cwe are brothers for a reason\u201D. Hern\xE1n told me about the hard\
  \ times Argentina was passing through regarding the economic fall, the diminishment\
  \ of Pesos\u2019 value and the rising of unemployment in the country. He complained\
  \ about the case of \u201Chijocracia\u201D, which is the neologism that englobes\
  \ \u201Cson\u201D and \u201Cdemocracy\u201D, a word Argentinians use to describe\
  \ the nepotistic practices that are visible in the political systems they have.\
  \ Hern\xE1n mentioned he was not from Buenos Aires but from Rosario, where the crime\
  \ scene was now unsustainable, because financial crises caused a chronic money problem.\
  \ And he also stated that Argentinian football was not that great even.\nWhen he\
  \ questioned me about Brazil I told him: \u201Cwe are brothers for a reason\u201D\
  . The Hispanic empire in America merged into Latin America, and even though Brazil\
  \ was not part of the Hispanic crown properties, we are for sure latino-americans,\
  \ but it is remarkable the uncountless times we forget about it. Maybe we don\u2019\
  t share the exact same language but we are bonded for so many other reasons: historically,\
  \ economically, culturally and socially. I didn\u2019t expect to find my latinity\
  \ using \u201Cconversa fiada\u201D with my taxi driver while I appreciated the beautiful\
  \ architecture from Buenos Aires, but you see: Hern\xE1n and I, we are brothers\
  \ for a reason."
