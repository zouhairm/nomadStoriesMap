Text: "If you're going to explore Tasmania's most remote region, you may as well do\
  \ it in comfort and style.\n\nIt\u2019s late afternoon in southwest Tasmania\u2019\
  s remote World Heritage Area. We're moored in a sheltered cove and, bar the eight\
  \ people on our boat, there\u2019s not a human to be seen. Neither are there buildings,\
  \ signage, jetties or even buoys. The only noises are the water lapping at the boat\
  \ and the distant sound of birds.\n\nWith no phone reception or internet there is\
  \ so little to distract me here that I am able to immerse myself fully in this experience\
  \ - Tasmanian Boat Charters\u2019 Port Davey Expedition Cruise.\n\nWe're in good\
  \ hands. The skipper of Odalisque (the 20-metre expedition cruise vessel we\u2019\
  ll call home for the next four days) is Pieter van der Woude. A former abalone diver,\
  \ he knows these waters, both on and below the surface, like few others. \n\nHis\
  \ love for this place becomes more and more infectious each day.\n\nThen there\u2019\
  s Peter Marmion, our guide, whose knowledge of Port Davey is extraordinary. A keen\
  \ adventurer, he has bushwalked all over the area and is passionate about preserving\
  \ and protecting it.\n\n\u201CEvery rock and every island has a story \u2013 and\
  \ there are a lot of rocks and islands here!,\u201D he tells us. \n\nHe's right\
  \ about the stories - and he loves telling them! Port Davey isn't populated but\
  \ people have come and gone, seeking riches from the whales or the pines, or searching\
  \ for a place to settle off the grid. There is a trove of tales, both of triumph\
  \ and of loss against the harsh elements and isolation. We also hear about the indigenous\
  \ people who first called this wilderness home.\n\nWe get plenty of chances to step\
  \ off Odalisque and explore the area's secluded beaches, isolated coves, rocky outcrops,\
  \ caves, forests, creeks, lakes, gorges and mountains.\n\nWe spot wombats, pademelons\
  \ and countless birdlife. We even stumble across the extremely rare orange-bellied\
  \ parrot and azure kingfisher, and trace footprints of the Tasmanian Devil.\n\n\
  The weather here can be severe but we're blessed with sunshine and calm conditions,\
  \ which means we can venture beyond the sanctuary of Port Davey to the Breaksea\
  \ Islands and Southern Ocean. \n\nOn our jet boat we island-hop, weaving among jagged\
  \ rocks and the tips of kelp forests.\n\nPieter gets us as close to everything as\
  \ he can \u2013 whether its pulling up next to a family of sunbaking seals or finding\
  \ a way into the caves tucked into the bases off cliffs.\n\nAt one point it\u2019\
  s like threading the eye of the needle as he waits for a wave to carry us through\
  \ a small opening between rocks. The swell lifts us through, assisted by slimy kelp\
  \ and sea foam.\n\nAt times my heart races and my knuckles whiten but with Pieter's\
  \ prowess and confidence on water I always feel safe.\n\nBack on board our \u2018\
  motherboat\u2019 chef Ken Mellers creates a parallel adventure, a culinary journey\
  \ showcasing Tasmania's amazing produce in every mouthwatering breakfast, lunch,\
  \ and three-course dinner, accompanied by local wines and beers.\n\nThe Odalisque\
  \ is a restaurant and hotel floating in the middle of nowhere. This is where this\
  \ trip differs to other remote wilderness adventures, especially in this part of\
  \ the world. \n\nThere are warm beds, hot showers, comfy couches and good coffee.\
  \ The view is ever-changing and always spectacular.\n\nBut it\u2019s not all luxury!\
  \ Each time we step off the boat we\u2019re reminded just how rugged, untamed, and\
  \ inhospitable this isolated corner of Tasmania can be. \n\nWe tackle steep hills,\
  \ slippery slopes, dense shrubbery, and mud up to our ankles while dodging prickly\
  \ plants, jumping ants nests, and wombat scat. \n\nBut at the end of each excursion\
  \ we are welcomed back on board Odalisque where warmth, a hot shower, and a glass\
  \ of wine await us! \n\nThis experience truly is the best of both worlds. If you\
  \ love extreme adventuring as much as you love creature comforts, this is the trip\
  \ for you."
