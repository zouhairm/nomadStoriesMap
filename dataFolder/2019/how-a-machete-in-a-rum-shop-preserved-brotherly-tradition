Text: "As a non-violent person dedicated to helping people, one wouldn\u2019t expect\
  \ my older brother\u2019s Washington D.C. apartment to boast an armory of exotic\
  \ weapons.\n\nDuring my first trip to Australia, I was ecstatic to find a rare left-handed\
  \ boomerang for Brett. His collection began with this simple novelty gift. Soon,\
  \ it evolved into an ironic, running tradition.\n\nThe next year, I returned from\
  \ Thailand with a handmade slingshot for hunting small game. A second trip to Australia\
  \ yielded a nulla nulla\u2014a heavy wooden club for hunting and self-defense. Coastal\
  \ Peniche produced a carefully-designed Portuguese octopus barb. Currently, a British\
  \ sword cane is being held somewhere in Moroccan Customs.\n\nEvery time he unwraps\
  \ one of these gifts, I giddily watch his face during the big reveal. He scratches\
  \ his head, we share a laugh, and inevitably segue into a dialog about the origin\
  \ of these unconventional objects. Apart from their sheer artistry and craftsmanship,\
  \ each weapon tells a story of cultural innovation and the people behind them.\n\
  \nAs our plane descends into Queen Beatrix International Airport, my mind fixates\
  \ upon this tradition, and the unknown weapon waiting to be discovered on Aruba\u2014\
  a place known affectionately as One Happy Island.\n\nThe people of Aruba have reason\
  \ to be happy. They reside safely outside of Hurricane Alley. They enjoy the most\
  \ sun in the Caribbean. Local divi-divi trees offer shady asylum across the island\u2019\
  s endless beaches, and a neglectful sunburn is easily remedied with the soothing\
  \ gel of the aloe cacti that flourish here. \n\nAlthough, it\u2019s not all smooth\
  \ sailing. The arid island is among the driest on the planet, averaging less than\
  \ 20 inches of annual rainfall. To survive these conditions, one must be resourceful.\
  \ From the indigenous Caquet\xEDo tribe that inhabited Aruba over 4000 years ago\
  \ to the Spanish and Dutch explorers that arrived centuries later, resourcefulness\
  \ is in their blood. \n\nUpon arrival, I channel this resourcefulness and begin\
  \ the search for something distinctly Caquet\xEDo\u2014perhaps a hunting spear or\
  \ fishing rod. However, after six days on the island, I\u2019ve found nothing worthy\
  \ of Brett\u2019s collection. As most of the island prepares to close for Christmas,\
  \ the outlook is grim.\n\nDetermined to make the most of our final afternoon on\
  \ the island, my fianc\xE9e, Danielle, and I make our way to Orange Plaza\u2014\
  a grungy strip mall on the western part of the island. Our destination is The Arubian\
  \ Taste\u2014a legendary, local rum shop known for creativity and owners that exude\
  \ generosity of spirit. \n\nJerome & Marsha have turned their passion for rum into\
  \ a sanctuary for tourists to beat the heat and sample the finest fermented sugarcane\
  \ on the island. Jerome greets us warmly and guides us through an exotic sampling\
  \ of flavored rums: coffee, banana, pistachio, coconut and aloe. \n\nWe discuss\
  \ Jerome\u2019s past, including his years at the Palmera Rum Factory, and his career\
  \ in law enforcement before that.\n\nTwo hours later, we\u2019ve lost some inhibition.\n\
  \n\u201CJerome, this is a longshot. Do you know where we could purchase an Aruban\
  \ weapon?\u201D\n \nAfter a long pause and intense eye contact, he responds simply,\
  \ \u201Ccome with me.\u201D\n\nI follow Jerome down a narrow hallway to a private\
  \ room. He kneels, reaches to the back of a cabinet, and pulls out a blanket. Then,\
  \ he turns to me with a telling grin, and carefully unwraps what\u2019s inside.\
  \ When the treasures are revealed, I\u2019m immediately overcome with a curious\
  \ mix of excitement and fascination.\n\nJerome unsheathes four enormous, impressive\
  \ blades, one by one, and tells me their stories.\n\nTwenty minutes later, we emerge\
  \ from the back room. Danielle looks down at the two-foot machete in my hand with\
  \ disbelief. \u201CI\u2019ll explain later,\u201D my eyes communicate.\n\nDriving\
  \ away from the strip mall, this mission is accomplished, but a new challenge presents\
  \ itself: transporting six liters of rum\u2014and a used machete\u2014through US\
  \ Customs.\n\nI picture the disbelief on my brother\u2019s face. I envision the\
  \ machete, mounted on his wall, between the boomerang and the nulla nulla. I see\
  \ our discussion unfold. This tale of unexpected discovery in the most peaceful\
  \ of places cannot go untold. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s time to channel the resourcefulness\
  \ that defines One Happy Island."
