Text: "i was planning this trip for 4 months since I\u2019ve arrived in the US. Little\
  \ girl\u2019s big dream is about to happen, and the preparation was serious. Another\
  \ gir from Russia joined me, and the funny fact is that she was dreaming about LA\
  \ since she was 10 years old. Hmm, what a chance I thought! I found someone as passionate\
  \ as I am to travel with. \nWe booked our flights (the cheapest that we could find,\
  \ with 8 hours layover in Las Vegas), and booked the cheapest hostel Wildblue. The\
  \ next step was booking Universal Studios tickets, and we successfully accomplished\
  \ our main preparations. \nWe had late flight from LV to LA on December 31. And\
  \ as you may understood, yes, it was New Year\u2019s Eve night! \nWe got to LA at\
  \ 10 pm, and all taxi services charged at least 50$ to get to our hostel from LA\
  \ airport! That was tremendously expensive for two cultural exchange students. Shortly\
  \ to tell, we tried to save money and got to our hostel at 12.15 am, while everyone\
  \ was celebrating New Year, we were trying to find our accommodation, walking throught\
  \ the streets with suitcases. My friend was about to cry, but I was positive. \u201C\
  Hey, you are in Los Angeles, even thought it\u2019s a little bit stressful for us,\
  \ we are here!\u201D- I told her. The fact that our phones were about to die added\
  \ some more stress, for sure. But I was so unexplainable happy! \nThen, when we\
  \ finally found our place, we realized that no one hears the door knocking and no\
  \ one answers a phone. Shoot! It\u2019s a night time, NYE, our phones are almost\
  \ dead, we are packed with baggage and we are in KoreaTown! The perspective of spending\
  \ a night on the street after long flight wasn\u2019t really tempting. \nBut then,\
  \ miracle happened. \nSomeone stopped near the hostel in a big MiniVan. It turned\
  \ out to be a little korean woman, she was an owner of this place, and she was extremely\
  \ mad at us, but still, decided to help (even thought we warned her that we have\
  \ late flight and we can\u2019t make it before 10 pm). Honestly to tell, that was\
  \ weird when she got out of the car and without any explanation told us to come\
  \ here and bring our baggage. Sounds dangerous, but we were so desperate to trust\
  \ and get into the car. \nEventually, she took us to another hostel which she possessed,\
  \ we got there at 1.30 am and FINALLY we made it to our beds! \nThat was pretty\
  \ lond day. \nThe next 3 days of our trip were amazing despite cold weather we didn\u2019\
  t expect to encounter with. \nOn out last day another unexpected surprise happened\
  \ to me. \nMe and my friend decided to visit Santa Monica beach. Oh my god, Santa\
  \ Monica is amazing! I knew that it is a very beatiful place to see, but I din\u2019\
  t expect it to be as a heaven. That was my first meeting the Ocean experience and\
  \ I was impressed by Pacific Ocean! \nWhen we were about to leave the beach and\
  \ a pier, my friend stopped to tie her shoelaces, and I was taking my last pictues\
  \ of the view. Suddenly, she said \u201CIndira, russian speaking people!\u201D.\
  \ I turned my head and I saw two guys who were looking at us too. I recognized my\
  \ fellow countryman right away, and said only one word \u201CKazakhstan?\u201D.\
  \ He nodded, and then introduced himself and his friend from Kyrgyzstan. \nThey\u2019\
  ve been living in the US for more than a year, and they\u2019ve been to LA pretty\
  \ often, so it was really nice of them to offer us to show the city. \nThis is how\
  \ our love story was born, because we are still together, and we are so thankful\
  \ that we met each other among thousands and thousands of people who were there\
  \ in SM. What is it? Contingency? Coincidence?\nWe don\u2019t know, but we are still\
  \ happy for that:) \nRegarding LA, I can tell that this city is worth to visit,\
  \ it has ocean, beach, palm trees, lots of sun, marijuana (just kiddng). \nYou should\
  \ try!"
