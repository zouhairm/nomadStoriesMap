Text: "The subtle drops of rain hit the cobble-stoned alleyway as I head into a quaint\
  \ yet lively pub in Glasgow\u2019s West End. Walking inside I\u2019m greeted by\
  \ rustic decor and muted stained-glass windows followed by gatherings of all sorts:\
  \ a circle of instrumentalists in the left corner creating the evening\u2019s music\
  \ with their fiddles and flutes, the various groups of Scottish men seated around\
  \ the bar drinking the city\u2019s favorite beer Tennents, and the couples of friends\
  \ and lovers enjoying chats over drinks. I look back around in search of my friends\
  \ as I notice a common theme among the pub: Everyone is laughing.\n\nWhen I found\
  \ out I would be calling Glasgow home for the next year as part of my undergraduate\
  \ degree, I scoured the internet for a glimpse of what lay ahead. The images were\
  \ lackluster at best in comparison to the more sought-after British cities such\
  \ as London and Edinburgh.\n\nBut despite the internet\u2019s seemingly bland take\
  \ on the city, Glasgow still had the power to sweep me away upon arrival. There\u2019\
  s a lot more to a city than its monuments and touristic attractions after all. There\u2019\
  s the people and the atmosphere that they create within the city, and that is where\
  \ Glasgow truly shines.\n\nBack in the pub, I join my group of mates as we eagerly\
  \ clink our pint glasses. It\u2019s a typical night of Tennents and banter, laughing\
  \ myself into tears because the Scottish are arguably the most hilarious culture.\
  \ They\u2019re the kind of funny that laughs at themselves and others while managing\
  \ to maintain a balance of sarcasm and a warm and welcoming demeanor, allowing you\
  \ to instantly feel right at home as if you\u2019ve been a part of the friend group\
  \ since its very first gathering.\n\nAs I head home that night, I think to myself\
  \ just how beautiful Glasgow really is. It\u2019s a city made by its people, and\
  \ it\u2019s true. Glasgow has even branded itself with the slogan \u201CPeople Make\
  \ Glasgow.\u201D The charm of Glasgow\u2019s people is undeniable.\n\nAlthough the\
  \ city may be rather gloomy and dreich (the Scottish word for grey and rainy), its\
  \ people will greet you with open arms, a warm smile, and a pint of beer as they\
  \ make you laugh until your stomach is sore. For that reason, among many others,\
  \ I will return time and time again to the city that never fails to make me feel\
  \ right at home."
