Text: "No money, no honey - in the literal translation into Russian it means you poor\
  \ and you have no food. In \u0415nglish it means you have to pay to get something.\n\
  I had experience when I had no money, but I was able to achieve what I wanted.\n\
  \nI\u2019m 19, I'm a student, I have no money, but I have a great desire to go on\
  \ a trip. \nAnd it was one of the most memorable trips! I got from point A to point\
  \ B by hitchhiking. I've never done this before, but my companions were one of the\
  \ most interesting interlocutors in my life.  We didn't know anything about each\
  \ other, but talked about everything. Yes, I always thought hitchhiking is dangerous,\
  \ but I was lucky to meet new friends. When they found out I had little money, they\
  \ fed me and \nhelped to find a stop-place. It was a library. Unusual library, as\
  \ you might guess. Visitors could not only read books day and night, they could\
  \ also watch films in a movie room, or sleep on sofas that were everywhere. \n-\
  \ Hi. Do you travel? Come in, - a young guy met me. \nI saw a lot of young people\
  \ who talked and played board games. There were no \"keep silence\" tablets and\
  \ an evil librarian. It was something like a big apartment, where old friends usually\
  \ met. And at that moment I was their old friend too.\n- Tea or coffee? Let's go\
  \ I\u2019ll show you the rooms. Are you tired? You can sleep where you want, - jabbered\
  \ a boy.\nYes, I was tired and I was surprised. I met new guys, they told me about\
  \ this city and gave some lifehack about how to spend time without money. \nWhen\
  \ I chose a bed, I immediately fell asleep, putting a backpack under my head. \n\
  - You are crazy! Go back, \u2013 said my friends when they heard me spend weekends.\n\
  But I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2018t worry about money, about time, about problems that\
  \ remained in another city. How often can you forget about everything and enjoy?\
  \ I used to do it rarely. Until that moment. \n\nSo, my story is not about guiding\
  \ routes or new cities. My story is about freedom. \nWe have a lot of fears and\
  \ stereotypes that prevent us from moving on and exploring new. Yes, i\u2019m a\
  \ young girl and it's dangerous to travel alone by hitchhiking. But I met amazing\
  \ people who are still my friends. A lot of people helped me and made my trip unforgettable.\
  \ \nAfter that I traveled with money, lived in comfortable hotels where working\
  \ staff fulfilled any request, but it was different. The most friendly and responsive\
  \ people met me then. When there is no money, you see a real world where you can\u2019\
  t buy help or support. This is where the real relationship begins, which we began\
  \ to forget. \nNot everything in this world can be bought. So if you have no money,\
  \ ask that man to show you where the nearest apiary is and collect enough honey\
  \ for yourself."
