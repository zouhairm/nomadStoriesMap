Text: "We were running on the slate leftovers in the middle of a yard, which was surrounded\
  \ by a strange combination of concrete buildings with wooden balconies and slate\
  \ rooftops. Typical Crimean slum, where lived poor locals, whose main source of\
  \ income were tourists, who could afford only small price apartments far from sea.\
  \ So was my family.\nI was 7 or 8 years old, so I think it was 2004. My parents\
  \ left for a day trip to Mount Ai-Petri and I decided to stay, cause I was scared\
  \ of hight to death. I spent the whole morning sitting on stairs and waiting for\
  \ other kids to get outside. Finally in the afternoon we started to play. It was\
  \ a bunch of kids, some were locals and some were tourists as myself. There was\
  \ a boy named Alex, which is quite unusual name for that place, normally he would\
  \ have been named Sasha, and so he was as I found out later. Every kid wanted to\
  \ be friends with him, so did I. We were playing catch-up, everyone was chasing\
  \ Alex. The boy was fast and hard to catch, he jumped through the window inside\
  \ some abandoned house and I jumped after him. We were alone, he had nowhere to\
  \ go, so we stopped and starred at each other, waiting for the move. \u201CAre you\
  \ Ukrainian?\u201D he asked suddenly. I nodded. \u201CI don\u2019t wanna play with\
  \ you\u201D, he said:\u201DI don\u2019t like Ukrainians\u201D. I felt silent. He\
  \ quickly jumped out of the window. \u201CAlex!\u201D, the kids outside yelled.\
  \ \nMoments later some guy found me inside standing still. \n\u2013Are you playing?\
  \ They\u2019ve caught Alex. \n\u2013No, I\u2019ll go home. My parents are coming\
  \ soon. \nNext thing I remember \u2013 my parents telling me about the trip. The\
  \ year later we came there again and I went to the Mountains with my parents."
