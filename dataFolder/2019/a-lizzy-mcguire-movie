Text: "I dropped out of my first year of university at age 19 and a booked a flight\
  \ to Italy. I didn\u2019t tell anyone in my family until the 5 months leading up\
  \ to my dissent. As thrilled as my parents were of me not being in college like\
  \ others my age, I honestly was on the mindset of \u201CI have to see it now\u201D\
  \ When I landed in Florence there was only one place I really wanted to go it was\
  \ this little cocktail bar next to the Ponte Vecchio I saw on Instagram. I and my\
  \ friend went in just for one drink, but slowly we were being offered more and more\
  \ stuff free stuff. Little did we know the owner was very smitten with my friend\
  \ and was very eager for us to stay longer.  It was getting dark and I knew I shouldn\u2019\
  t be there third wheeling so I decided to leave. As I said my goodbyes and started\
  \ to walk out the door I felt a very gentle tap on my back and turned around to\
  \ see the most handsome man I\u2019ve ever seen. He turned out to be a Sommelier\
  \ who later showed me there wine basement with wines costing more than \u20AC5000.\
  \ After the tour he offered to buy us a bottle of wine to share and we stayed there\
  \ until probably 3 AM talking.  Can you told me about things and his beautiful little\
  \ Italian town and the way that he described it just made my heart melt and I knew\
  \ at that moment I was falling for the sommelier. That night he asked me \u201C\
  if you don\u2019t mind I would love to take you on a date.\u201D Of course me seeing\
  \ all the great movies like Taken about girls being trafficked agreed to go on a\
  \ date with him. The next day he picked me up on his scooter and told me he had\
  \ to buy another helmet just for me. He then proceeded to take me to a very nice\
  \ restaurant that meant a lot to him. As the night was ending he asked to take me\
  \ up to the Vineyard overlooking Florence. It was my last night in Florence and\
  \ I couldn\u2019t resist but to say yes. As we overlooked the valley of Florence\
  \ he turned his head and he kissed me. The next morning I told him that it would\
  \ be best if we left things as perfect as they were like that. My time in Florence\
  \ was an actual love story."
