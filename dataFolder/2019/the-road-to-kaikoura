Text: "I waited beside a graveyard, next to a small white church, with my thumb out.\
  \ They\u2019ll feel bad for you, he\u2019d said, you\u2019ll get picked up in thirty\
  \ minutes, tops. After three hours, I wondered what I was doing wrong, questioning\
  \ every decision I\u2019d ever made in life. I was tired, confused, hungry, cursing\
  \ the sun for scorching every inch of skin I couldn\u2019t cover in sunscreen. I\
  \ leaned my pack against a clapboard fence, sat down, and peeled a mandarin. \n\n\
  As I sat lost in thought a van lurched to a stuttered stop in a cloud of dust. Leah\
  \ leaned out the window, a tattoo of a flowering vine shown on her forearm balanced\
  \ on the windowsill. \u201CC\u2019mon man! Hop in.\u201D I sat on a mattress in\
  \ the back, beside an acoustic guitar missing a string. There were dried herbs,\
  \ burnt sage, flowers hanging by twine, all swaying along with the curves of the\
  \ road. \u201CYou look tired,\u201D Luke said smiling, as we connected eyes by way\
  \ of a glance in the rearview mirror. I told him I was headed to Kaikoura, and he\
  \ said they could get me an hour closer, which we all agreed was better than nothing.\n\
  \nThey left me at a pull-off between an empty paddock and a shuttered gas station.\
  \ It took only a few minutes before another car stopped. \u201CI live an hour south\
  \ of Kaikoura,\u201D said Tim. He was on his way from Christchurch where he\u2019\
  d picked up his mother\u2019s ashes earlier that morning. He farmed sheep for a\
  \ living, was chief of the local fire brigade, and a father of three. He told me\
  \ how it used to be, back when wool brought in a high price, before the development\
  \ of synthetics, and how the only way for him to make a living these days was to\
  \ raise his sheep for meat. I mentioned that my Greek grandmother cooked lamb all\
  \ the time. He smiled and said eagerly, \u201CLamb is really the only meat you can\
  \ eat for tea every night.\u201D \n\nTim let me off by a bridge which straddled\
  \ a rushing river. Babbling rapids and bird songs echoed over pine dusted hillsides,\
  \ past brush covered cliffs, through a valley below leading toward a distant bushland.\
  \ There was a divine peace in the solitude which was shattered when Jim careened\
  \ over the bridge, hit the brakes and yelled at me to throw my pack in the trailer.\
  \ \u201CTuck it under the tin roofing so it doesn\u2019t fall out.\u201D There was\
  \ an opened box of ice cream bars on the leather front seat. \u201CI tried to eat\
  \ them all,\u201D he said, \u201Cbut my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Have one.\u201D\
  \ I bit into the melting Magnum bar, trying to avoid the falling drops of chocolate\
  \ which inevitably speckled my shirt. \u201CI used to live in Christchurch before\
  \ the earthquake hit. No one would gather inside after that. Everyone got earthquake\
  \ brain,\u201D he chuckled dubiously, \u201CWe live on the sound now. That\u2019\
  s where I\u2019m headed. It\u2019s safe and quiet. We fish right off the dock.\u201D\
  \ The engine labored in low gear as we climbed the winding road, finishing the box\
  \ of Magnum bars. When we crested the final hill, we caught sight of the azure sea\
  \ spreading out infinitely. \u201CWe\u2019re almost there,\u201D Jim said, \u201C\
  Would you like to stop and see the seals before I drop you off?\u201D I\u2019d love\
  \ that.\n\nI booked a room at a local hostel and arrived just as the sun began to\
  \ set. Someone yelled my name, and a familiar face approached. My friend Hitesh\
  \ grabbed me in a hug. \u201CI took your advice!\u201D I said, \u201CI ditched the\
  \ rental car and hitchhiked instead.\u201D I reached into my bag and grabbed a half\
  \ bottle of cheap wine, saying we should celebrate, just as we did when we first\
  \ met a week before, while I was driving south and he was standing there with his\
  \ thumb out on the side of the road."
