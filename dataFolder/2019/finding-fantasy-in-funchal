Text: "It can be difficult or foreboding trying to get settled in a new vacation spot,\
  \ however it always helps to have an open mind. I found a new lease on life and\
  \ a new way to view a new experience in a new place. I\u2019d never been to this\
  \ colonial city far off in the Atlantic before, but the people of Funchal weave\
  \ the ocean into their way of life and use it to their advantage to bring you in\
  \ and make you feel welcome in their hillside capital. From Octopus broth to sunset\
  \ catamaran cruises, you\u2019re never far from the ocean in Funchal, the ocean\
  \ lives within the hearts of the locals. The winding streets snake their way from\
  \ the church of Monte to the waterfront promenade, no matter what they\u2019ll always\
  \ bring you back to a familiar place. The tight alleys lined with cafes and bars\
  \ bring a welcoming atmosphere, always packed with friendly faces, they\u2019ll\
  \ always make you feel at home. I certainly found myself feeling more and more welcome\
  \ into this unknown city the more I was able to explore, they\u2019ll warm your\
  \ heart with poncha, wine and cake. Better yet you\u2019ll even find yourself becoming\
  \ more like a local than a visitor."
