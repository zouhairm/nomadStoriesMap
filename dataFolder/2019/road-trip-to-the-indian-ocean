Text: "We had been warned about the trip as we left the Swaziland border. Patrol officers\
  \ reminded us that there was a reason why Ponta De Ouro, was one of the least visited\
  \ beach towns. The drive was filled with desolate roads under scorching heat and\
  \ the Goba Village, although rumored to now have tar roads, still had multi-kilometer\
  \ stretches of rock-terrain. We were traveling in a small two-wheel drive sedan\
  \ and many told us the car wouldn't make it. Seth and I decided we had to try. \
  \ \n\nWhen we hit the Goba Village, we were surrounded with dry trees, abandoned\
  \ rondavels, the occasional billboard, but it was mostly just empty flat plains.\
  \ More than 30 minutes in we laughed. The village didn\u2019t hold a candle to rush-hour\
  \ in Midtown Manhattan. Minutes into our laughter, the car began rattling and bouncing.\
  \ Seth pulled us over and I felt butterflies in my stomach as I stepped out. He\
  \ checked the map twice, and confirmed we were on the right path \u2013 the only\
  \ route through Goba Village. I looked ahead and everything as far as my eyes could\
  \ see was covered in gravel and sand.  \n\nWe got in the car and drove forward.\
  \ With each move rocks flicked off our windshield, rattled the rims on the wheels,\
  \ and shook our rental. The sand spattered across our windshield. I started to second-guess\
  \ our decision. In New York my job was cost-benefit analysis, and doing the math\
  \ in my head the responsible thing would be to turn back, lose a day, find another\
  \ route, or head back to Swaziland. The car wasn't ours and we had no phones or\
  \ the luxury of road-side assistance. Economically, it made sense to turn-back and\
  \ take the loss.   \n\nI've always been practical and have always believed it's\
  \ better to be safe than sorry. But sitting in that car, something felt different.\
  \ Maybe it was stubbornness, or being over-tired from the 12-hour flight of the\
  \ day prior, or perhaps being on the empty and silent road with no electronic distractions\
  \ forced me to listen to myself and I realized I wanted us to keep going. We drove\
  \ forward, going no more than 10 mph, Seth barely pressing the gas, me barely breathing.\
  \ When the shaking stopped and the rock terrain ended, I grabbed Seth's face and\
  \ kissed him. A green sign reading Maputo Special Reserve \u2013Maputo Bay could\
  \ be seen ahead. I rolled down the window and let the wind pull my hair back as\
  \ we drove. In the distance, giraffes and African elephants grazed, the elephants\
  \ walking strong and the giraffes looming tall.  \n\nWhen we hit pure gold-sand\
  \ we parked to the side of the road, behind a few beat-up pick-ups and ATV\u2019\
  s. I changed into flip-flops and stepped out of the car while Seth changed into\
  \ his swim trunks. The sand was soft, almost silk-like as it slid through my toes.\
  \ We grabbed our bags and started to walk.   When we hit the center square, locals\
  \ around us displayed their handmade crafts and motioned to their tiny stands. The\
  \ smell of grilled maize and cassava filled the air around me as ATV\u2019s zoomed\
  \ past. There was Portuguese music echoing from small huts and bars, and local kids\
  \ ran by grinning and staring as Seth and I walked through.   \n\nThe more we walked,\
  \ the more I admired the locals in their humble garments dancing so freely to the\
  \ music in the background and the more warmth I felt towards the people around me\
  \ who yelled bem vinda and cheers as they passed through. I stopped clutching my\
  \ wallet and threw it in my bag, which I now carried lose on my back.   \n\nNormally,\
  \ Seth and I would have asked for directions and reassurance we were headed the\
  \ right way, but in that moment, we just kept walking. I let myself get lost in\
  \ small stands of fresh fruit or vividly colored hand-made crafts, unafraid of where\
  \ the road would take us. When we did hit the shoreline, we were greeted with gold\
  \ specs shining against crystal water. I dropped my things, put down my hair, and\
  \ without looking back, ran straight for the Indian ocean."
