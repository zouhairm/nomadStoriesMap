Text: "A visit to my Countryside beats my imagination of what I thought of it before\
  \ now. Having stayed away from my village for more than a decade, my parents decided\
  \ we visit Okposi-Okwu in Ohaozara local government Area of Ebonyi State, Ebonyi.\
  \ This state is known for its salt production from a popular River called \u201C\
  Umahi\u201D River of salt. Most men engage in fishing for their livelihood. It happened\
  \ that we had to leave Abuja for Okposi-Okwu all in Nigeria very early so as to\
  \ beat traffic jam.\nThe preparation started when my sister and i went for clothing\
  \ shopping, you know as people who have stayed away for a very long time we felt\
  \ is necessary we look our best to the villagers we were going to meet and to show\
  \ them we are from the city where everybody who has not been to the city believes\
  \ that everywhere is always illuminated and light does not go off for any reason.\n\
  Before the actual day of our departure which was on the 15th of December 2017, my\
  \ father father announced that we will be leaving by 5:00AM because the road would\
  \ be too busy as many people in live in the city travel home for festive celebration.\
  \ We found ourselves crossing through different path when we did hit the road. We\
  \ were meant to pass through Abuja to Kogi- Edo-Delta-Anambra-Enugu then to Ebonyi\
  \ state which is our final destination.\nAs that was my first time travelling as\
  \ an adult, I was awake all through the journey to explore my Countryside\u2019\
  s Cultural Heritage and Believes. The journey was full of expectation as I hope\
  \ to see majority of my relatives. My ecstasy was cut short when I noticed some\
  \ uniform men mandating every motorist to pay a token to them before they could\
  \ continue on that road, I asked my father what that was for, but he chuckled and\
  \ said the matter is best left undiscussed as that would spring more conversation\
  \ he wouldn\u2019t want to engage on.\nThe journey became more interesting to me\
  \ after we had spent 4 hours from Abuja to Delta State of Nigeria, then we got to\
  \ Anambra State which share a boundary with Delta State these states are demarcated\
  \ with Niger Bridge  a Bridge for the popular Nigeria River Niger which is the longest\
  \ River in West- Africa. I decided to use my stopwatch to calculate the time duration\
  \ spent on crossing the river on the Speedometer of 80sp and it happened that we\
  \ spent 9 minutes to cross the Niger Bridge to one of the famous City in Nigeria\
  \ Onitsha, and it is said to be the largest market in West Africa \nThe journey\
  \ continued as we entered Enugu State after crossing several Cities in Anambra State\
  \ on getting to Enugu, I looked through the Window as I saw so many Hawkers hawking\
  \ different things ranging from food to household iteams, as they beckoned on Motorist\
  \ to patronize them. My mother asked my father to stop so that she could buy \u201C\
  Okpa\u201D a particular food rapped on a black leaf that is associated with the\
  \ Nsukka people a Tribe in Enugu State. This food is so delicious that we regretted\
  \ not buying enough. One more thing I noticed in Enugu unlike other States, was\
  \ that the Land is Sloppy and the earth colour is clay.\nAnd here comes my countryside\
  \ as we were welcomed by a sculpture of a Woman distributing salt, as we proceed\
  \ to my native home Okposi- Okwu, I was threw in shock and surprise when I saw beautiful\
  \ houses built with Bricks as if that wasn\u2019t enough I turned right to behold\
  \ Castle on my enquiry I found out it was for my Village King, I was marveled because\
  \ I was expecting to see Mud House but my assumption was wrong, as some of the houses\
  \ were far better than the one we live in the city with good Motor able roads. \n\
  Judging from the story my mother told us , as regards to their growing up in the\
  \ village, on how they woke up early to go to the stream and fetch water before\
  \ it gets dirty as a result of too many fetchers  to how they go to the farm only\
  \ to come back when the Sun sets at the East to going to the Village Square to see\
  \ Masquerade and to watch able bodied men wrestle in contest over a beautiful Maiden\
  \ who becomes the wife of the winner and so forth. I realized all those things has\
  \ been faced out with the era of digital innovation. \nEven my Village Maiden that\
  \ I expected to see tying a piece of cloth on their waist and using leafs to cover\
  \ their nipples now go about wearing sophisticated apparel looking more sophisticated\
  \ than than some of us in the city. Some of this young women use high quality and\
  \ costly phones which could be used to purchase a piece of land in the city. I was\
  \ learnt from my mother\u2019s friend who told my mother that those ladies no longer\
  \ go to the farm as they say farm work is for older women which was not so during\
  \ their time.\nThe height the surprise came when my grandmother and I were cooking\
  \ in the kitchen and as I was about to bring down the pot from the Chimney only\
  \ for me to behold a green Snake and I shouted when my brother arinze rushed out\
  \ with a cutlass but my granny held him and said they are not our enemy, I looked\
  \ in awe on why a green Snake which is identified as the most dangerous Snake would\
  \ be our friend, not until she told me how the Snake saved our forefathers and how\
  \ anyone who kills it would give  it a befitting burial or else face the consequences\
  \ .\nFinally my grandmother made me to part the snake on the back, according to\
  \ her it only came to welcome me home.  Even snakes welcome people home."
