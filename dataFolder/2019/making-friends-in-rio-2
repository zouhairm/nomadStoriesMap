Text: "In October 2018, I spent a week in Rio de Janeiro, it was my first trip alone\
  \ and I was both excited and scared. As a beginner in the world of backpackers,\
  \ I had researched a lot about the places I wanted to meet and I set up a script\
  \ for each day, going in as many places as possible. Arriving at the hostel, I met\
  \ two girls, from Chile and S\xE3o Paulo, who shared a room with me, and quickly\
  \ became friends and went out to explore Rio together. It was amazing! With them,\
  \ I met several local people, learning a little about the daily life of the city,\
  \ besides tourism. I did not go everywhere I had planned alone, because I was enjoying\
  \ the places that I went much more, enjoying the companies of my friendships and\
  \ more details and stories of the place, as it was in Parque Lage, a place full\
  \ of culture and nature, and in the I made friends with a local biologist. I definitely\
  \ felt happier and comfortable driving my trip like that, than how I had planned,\
  \ just going through several places without really taking advantage of what that\
  \ point has to offer. \nA place I went to on my own, because my new friends were\
  \ gone, it was the Sugar Loaf. This place is incredible and certainly can not miss\
  \ the trip to Rio, from there you have an incredible view of the city and the immensity\
  \ of the sea. And beyond what I expected, even being a place full of tourists there\
  \ are places under the trees to cool off from 40 degrees Celsius and relax a bit.\
  \ It was on one of those stools that I met a Bolivian boy who also was traveling\
  \ alone. After a good chat, I went out for another contemplation and exchanged some\
  \ words with a nice German couple.\nIn a nutshell, I left for the trip with a list\
  \ of places to go and came back full of stories, good memories, and friends. I think\
  \ that this is how trips should be, providing not only moments of rest and tasting,\
  \ but also allow us to delve into the history of the place and allow ourselves to\
  \ make friends and be open to what they can add in our lives."
