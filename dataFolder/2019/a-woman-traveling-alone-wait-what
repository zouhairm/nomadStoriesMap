Text: "I just bought my boarding pass and as always, I\xB4m traveling alone.\n\nAren\xB4\
  t  you afraid? poeple ask me that all the time, but what I discovered in this journey\
  \ was a life experience. \n\nI arrived in Puerto Vallarta Mexico, a majestic jungle\
  \ full of life, excited because I managed to finish my book during the flight. I\
  \ settle in the \"Vallarta Hostel\", pure magic: bright colors, Mexican murals,\
  \ and adorable hostess. I decided to register to the tour \"La cueva del amor\"\
  \ (the cave of love), my first destination:\n\n -Miss! How many tickets do you go\
  \ want to buy? you and your boyfriend?\n\n -No thanks, just one\n\n-Ok, so take\
  \ someone to accompany you and have some romance at least\n\nI laughed with the\
  \ gentleman who so kindly wanted to see me in love. After, I decide to go to dinner\
  \ at \"La Bodeguita del Medio\":\n\n -Good evening, table for two? \n\n-Hello! table\
  \ for one please \n\nThe waitress is embarrassed by her assumption and immediately\
  \ attends me. They were all so warm and cheerful: salsa, cuban flavor and happiness\
  \ every second, it was that kind of place where you don\xB4t know whether to eat\
  \ or dance ... so I danced while eating. \n\nThe next morning, \"La cueva del amor\"\
  \ awaited, one of the most visited destinations of Mexico and of course, the boat\
  \ full of couples, however, the lovers didn\xB4t take long to asked me:\n\n-Hi!\
  \ You came alone?\n\n-No (with an internal voice from my mother telling me to answer\
  \ that), but I did attend the tour alone.\n\nThe ship was small, so everyone showed\
  \ emotion and impression for my adventure ... but that's what the cave made me felt:\
  \ I had to swim 20 meters against the current to enter. Being inside, the beach\
  \ and its nature made me felt in love with the space and happy with myself. So I\
  \ dedicated to be the photographer of the rest of the couples so they could take\
  \ my pic. That day, my date was the cave.  \n\nThe next morning I decided to explore\
  \ the town, full of Mexican life, crafts, stone, embroidery and Mexican food, what\
  \ else could I ask for? this town showed it to me in my face: live music, elders\
  \ dancing danz\xF3n in the middle of the  historical park, with so much class and\
  \ symmetry. I was able to recognize one of the couples of a famous video of a Mexican\
  \ singer \"Natalia Lafourcade\", where they show their dance with sensuality and\
  \ elegance ... right there, in front of me, dancing with everyone.\n\nI just admired\
  \ them. Then the music of salsa and cumbia began, putting the whole public on its\
  \ feet and obviously me.\n\n-Hello! are you with your boyfriend?\n\n-Hahaha, no\n\
  \n-Can we dance?\n\n-Yes!\n\n-Are you traveling alone?\n\n-No, my friends are over\
  \ there (again the voice of my mother telling me to say that)\n\n A child who was\
  \ beside told me:\n\n-Go dance! I can take care of  your purse\n\nI left it with\
  \ mistrust (against my mother's inner voice telling me I was crazy for leaving my\
  \ stuff with the kid) so I just danced. A few minutes later torrents of rain began\
  \ from nowhere, however, we all continue to dance in the rain, with contagious joy.\
  \ All this for zero pesos and for being, until now, the happiest day of my life,\
  \ in a little town in a cost of M\xE9xico  (and no, my purse was not stolen).\n\n\
  Learning: Everyone expects to see a woman accompanied on a trip ... and with a man.\
  \ Society fears for our safety, I feared for mine and that's why I lied. It is important\
  \ to keep us safe as women, but I realized that the fear of being alone, seeing\
  \ myself alone and traveling alone, is part of an experience we need to face, to\
  \ learn to live on our own, to feel safe in our social environment and to show us\
  \ that being alone and traveling alone is necessary to learn to love ourselves,\
  \ to have contact with nature and with the happiness that strangers can offer us.\
  \ Puerto Vallarta, thank you for making me feel like a free and loved woman."
