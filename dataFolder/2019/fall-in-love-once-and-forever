Text: "The story started about 5 years ago (honestly I think this feeling was always\
  \ inside me), but I don't think that it matters. So we could call it \"once\":\n\
  Once I went to Paris knowing only that it's the capital of France, people there\
  \ speak French and their main dish is \"cuisses de grenouille\" (frogs legs). But\
  \ when I firstly walked in the streets which are made of \u0431\u0440\u0443\u0441\
  \u0447\u0430\u0442\u043A\u0430 I realized: I have fallen in love. Since then I learn\
  \ Paris every time differently and every time with different emotions. I have been\
  \ there many times but the things you remember at their highest point are only some\
  \ seconds, minutes which you spend being in particular situations. My last trip\
  \ to Paris was completely foolish: I was not prepared at all neither for the emotions\
  \ I have experienced nor for the things I would do. My trip started from Lyon where\
  \ I took a direct bus for 12 euros. Being full with pasta which my Italian friends\
  \ had made I was happy going to Paris with knowing any worries. It was a night bus\
  \ which came at 6 o'clock in the morning at a train station Bercy . I put my luggage\
  \ into a lock box not to carry it all day long because at the evening I had to take\
  \ my luggage and go to the nearest city called Courdimanche where my aunt lived.\
  \ \nSince that my Parisian twelve-hour-life had started. Usually I don\u2019t have\
  \ an itinerary in my head I just follow streets which seem to be more or less \u201C\
  local\u201D and can give me more information about a city. I started the day from\
  \ a typical touristic place \u2013 \u201CHotel de ville\u201D which is next to Notre-Dame\
  \ de Paris. But the idea was to have breakfast somewhere next to the \u201Csuper\u201D\
  \ center not feeling that you are in the center. So I have chosen a caf\xE9 hidden\
  \ somewhere between streets and as it was an early morning I was eating my croissant\
  \ watching mothers and fathers going with their children to school. The feeling\
  \ was that I was absolutely a part of this routine life but at the same time I felt\
  \ I was very far away from the reality. We were talking with a man who was pretending\
  \ being not a Parisian one but it was obvious that he was local and we were frightening\
  \ pigeons from our tables. \nThen I was mistaken in a shop with somebody who was\
  \ a friend of cashier. I had to answer the questions about \u201Cmy baby\u201D and\
  \ \u201Cmy studies\u201D while the cashier was trying to find some change and asking\
  \ me to come back later for it. \nThe main purpose of this trip to Paris being impressed\
  \ by the film \u201CLes amants du Flore\u201D I wanted to follow the route of two\
  \ lovers and philosophes Simone de Beauvoir et Jean-Paul Sartre. I have found the\
  \ famous caf\xE9 where the main theories were invented and it drew me absolutely\
  \ crazy \u2013 being exactly at the same place where those two people were. I was\
  \ under emotions during all the time I was at the caf\xE9 and I wasn\u2019t even\
  \ shocked when I saw I bill for 100 euros. It turned out that a waiter was mistaken\
  \ and gave me a bill of my neighbours. This couple gently paid for my coffee while\
  \ my gratitude was some \u201Clifehacks\u201D where to go in Paris and my studies\
  \ in France. We have changed numbers \u201Cin case\u201D. That\u2019s so funny learning\
  \ some private stories of strangers which are becoming \u201Cclose people\u201D\
  \ in a second and leave you alone stealing yours. \nBut I was not upset, oppositely\
  \ it was looking for the continuation of my adventures: I was to a university of\
  \ arts and architecture as a guest. And I had a chance to come there as they thought\
  \ I was a student. I was a part of this student life not even knowing what exactly\
  \ they did there. \nIt wasn\u2019t the end of my small Parisian life\u2026it is\
  \ \u201Cto be continued\u201D."
