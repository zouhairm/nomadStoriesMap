Text: "It\u2019s 6 am, and I\u2019m already sitting in a lotus position, trying hard\
  \ not to fall asleep. It\u2019s pretty chilly here, and, frankly, I\u2019d rather\
  \ get back to my warm bed in the tree house. But, well, I came here to experience\
  \ something new. To do things differently. So, I take a breath and focus my attention\
  \ on the center of my body. Wherever it is supposed to be.\n\nHow would you picture\
  \ a meditation retreat on a cute little island? Like sunbathing, drinking smoothies,\
  \ swimming from dusk till dawn and having little breaks for spiritual talks? That\u2019\
  s what retreats are supposed to be \u2013 relaxing. I\u2019ve thought so. But not\
  \ on Mooktawan. \n\nHere you live a life of a Buddhist monk. It\u2019s about discipline\
  \ and austerity. You sleep in a hut on wooden pillars. You compel yourself to sit\
  \ motionlessly for 4-6 hours daily. You fight with body ache. You listen to monks\
  \ telling you: \u201CSlow down and do nothing.\u201D What? Do nothing? That\u2019\
  s impossible! Especially, for us, avid travelers, who are used to be on the run.\
  \ Running has turned into sitting and observing. No swimming or sunbathing. No pictures,\
  \ please. No talk. No social media. Worse: gadgets are prohibited. \n\nOn Mooktawan\
  \ you have thousands, millions of moments to get bored. Or use this boredom to start\
  \ noticing. For example, how the sun lazily rises from the foggy ocean. How monks\
  \ walk slowly and gracefully. How their orange robes rustle. How steam from freshly\
  \ cooked tofu dissolves into the air. Tiny small things that you pay attention to,\
  \ because you have time. Way too much time to simply be here and now. With what\
  \ you have around. Listening to all that plethora of bizarre forest sounds. Gently\
  \ touching leaves. Looking at the ocean far beneath the retreat center. Smelling\
  \ raindrops. I\u2019m not kidding, rain has its smell here. It\u2019s a scent of\
  \ freshness mixed with some anticipation. Once you even dare to taste it. You start\
  \ having this insane craving for tasting everything. It is not surprising, since\
  \ you eat only twice per day and until noon. So, no wonder, you\u2019re hungry.\
  \ It makes all your senses switch on and get alert. Mundane routine things become\
  \ rituals. You know that this island is teaching you a lesson. Through discipline,\
  \ through austerity, it teaches you to be very attentive to the present moment.\
  \ \n\nAt a first glance, having a chance to live on a little Thai island is exciting\
  \ and easy-going. So much to see, to experience, to post about! What you happen\
  \ to experience on Mooktawan is far from exciting though. Excitement is way to noisy\
  \ and expressive. So, I\u2019d rather call it magical. Pure quiet magic, hidden\
  \ all around. It is this feeling that every second something happens, and you have\
  \ a rare opportunity to witness it. It is this feeling that boredom actually does\
  \ not exist. Every single moment there is something to see, to taste, to embrace."
