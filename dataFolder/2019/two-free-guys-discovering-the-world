Text: "Our name is Ignacio and Miguel, we are micropreneurs and digital nomads from\
  \ Spain, currently based in South-East Asia (Thailand and Bali). Some years ago,\
  \ we were trapped living grey lives in Madrid, in steady jobs we hated. Every day\
  \ of our lives was the same: waking up early, force-feeding ourselves and getting\
  \ into a massive traffic jam to get to our cubicles. We would spend most of the\
  \ day in our respective jobs and come back home, exhausted, and eager for the weekend\
  \ to arrive to be able to enjoy life... just a little bit. Rinse, clean and repeat.\n\
  \nOne day we decided we'd had enough. We left our jobs, became freelancers first,\
  \ and then transitioning to entrepreneurs. Our goal was freeing ourselves from the\
  \ chains of physical locations, borders, frontiers, gray jobs, schedules and limitations\
  \ of our current society. We became e-Residents of Estonia to be able to establish\
  \ location independent businesses in Europe. Our plan was being able to travel the\
  \ world, running our businesses.\n\nSoon after, we took the leap and became digital\
  \ nomads. We decluttered our lives, selling or giving away all the stuff that didn't\
  \ fit into our suitcases, put our affairs in order, and took a plane. I started\
  \ a blog (https://micropreneur.life) to write about the e-Residency program, the\
  \ nomad lifestyle, and entrepreneurship. But also to share my journey alongside\
  \ my husband, and how we managed to escape the routine of our grey standstill-life\
  \ in Madrid. \n\nRight now, we travel the world, free, sharing our journey together\
  \ with others to let them know that everyone can make it. We were well in our late\
  \ 30s/early 40s, so you are never too old to change your life. We have met location\
  \ independent entrepreneurs and digital nomads from all over the world. Lone wolves,\
  \ families, couples, young and old people... That made us realize your dreams can\
  \ come true if you really take action. Age, sex, kids, money... none of that matters.\n\
  \nWe hope our story can inspire others!"
