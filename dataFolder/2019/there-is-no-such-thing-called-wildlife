Text: "It was a usual morning, I was surfing Instagram with one eye opened. Because\
  \ of tiredness, I couldn\u2019t open both and suddenly Google news notification\
  \ popped up on my screen saying Nairobi was attacked by terrorists! And now both\
  \ eyes are open and looking at the mobile very clearly. And then I realized it was\
  \ not tiredness, it was jet lag and I was just landed India 10 hours before from\
  \ Nairobi, which was actually a 14-hour flight. Yes, the attack happened the day\
  \ after I left from Nairobi and I wished Why wasn\u2019t my flight on the day of\
  \ the attack?\n\nThere are two things I learned from the trip of Kenya, I.e, Kenya\
  \ is not only about Wildlife and there is no such thing called Wildlife. The Road\
  \ trip across Kenya, chit chat with locals and those community shops showed more\
  \ than the wildlife, there is life. The instance I want to share where the wrong\
  \ understanding of mine on African men changed forever. I was having a little conversation\
  \ with a community shop sales girl and with her permission, I started taking her\
  \ pictures, a man came from behind and said \u201CWhy are you taking my wife's\u2019\
  \ photographs? Who gave the permission? with a very intense voice. I said, I took\
  \ permission from her, he started laughing and said he was joking, and I can take,\
  \ but with one condition, that when he comes to India, I have to allow him to take\
  \ photographs of my wife, although, for him, I looked like I am married, which I\
  \ am not, I said OK. We made a deal. There was much laughter, there was an innocent\
  \ joke, a great sense of humor in this man, by which my wrong understanding fully\
  \ changed.\nAnd why I said, there is no such thing called Wildlife? I had 7-8 safaris\
  \ in Masaimara National Reserve and Crescent island in Lake Naivasha, honestly,\
  \ I didn\u2019t find them wild! They may look aggressive, but not all the time,\
  \ I saw them hunting for food, we work for food and we eat animals too, I saw them\
  \ resting and being with family, which we also do. Unless we attack, they don\u2019\
  t attack, but we without giving chance to them we butcher them and we eat them!\
  \ I didn\u2019t get why we call their life as Wild and not ours?\n\nThe other most\
  \ important thing I saw is, what they call themselves as Masai Tribe, Nah, I am\
  \ not convinced. It all looked like someone has just used Photoshop and created\
  \ the whole scene. I am sure its a stage act. Not liked it. Disappointed.\n\nWell,\
  \ If I need to conclude then here it is,\n\nKenya, a trip which gave me a different\
  \ perspective on people, wildlife and myself. It was all about making local connections,\
  \ understanding them so I can learn more about the world and Yes, I succeeded."
