Text: "\"We are going on an adventure!\", I still hear my fathers words as I think\
  \ back. I was only twelve years old at the time, but the memory is clear as a beautiful\
  \ South African summers day. \nThe month was December, summer in South Africa. My\
  \ father had bought a caravan for the four members of my family and attached it\
  \ to the large grey Jeep. I had my bags packed and was ready to go on an adventure\
  \ of a lifetime. \n\nOur trip began in the early hours of the morning. My mother\
  \ sat in the passenger seat with the many packets of food and snacks as my sister\
  \ and I sat in the back seat with our pillows and blankets covering our bodies and\
  \ half our faces. My dad locked up our house and jumped in the front seat and we\
  \ were finally ready to go. \n\nThe trip was hard, emotionally as well as physically.\
  \ Our goal was to travel all the way to the Tanzanian border. My father, having\
  \ worked as a truck driver through Mozambique in the beginning of his move to South\
  \ Africa, stocked up on bags and bags of sweets before we left. I was puzzled as\
  \ to why we needed this many sweets, but as we entered Mozambique, I realised. As\
  \ we made stops along the way, big groups of children of all ages, would swoop around\
  \ our car. Despite having so little, an aura of happiness surrounded these children.\
  \ I will never forget their wide smiles as they received their sweets from us and\
  \ shared it amongst themselves. \n\nThis memory stays imprinted in my mind to this\
  \ day.\n\nThe following year, my father planned a trip for us to Nice, Paris and\
  \ Monaco. Just 4 months after our trip to Mozambique. I was not aware at the time,\
  \ but I eventually came to realise that this was all strategic. My parents wanted\
  \ us to see the difference between rich and poor. They wanted to put us through\
  \ hardships of camping in the middle of Mozambique before they took us to luxury\
  \ restaurants and 5 star hotels in Nice. This was a life lesson, this is what taught\
  \ us to stay humble. I now appreciate this. \n\nToday, I am 24 years old and have\
  \ traveled alone, with groups and with my partner. I have never wanted to stay in\
  \ 5 star hotels and close myself off in luxury restaurants. Today, I stay in hostels,\
  \ meeting new people and interacting with friendly local waiters. I am independent\
  \ and have already lived in 3 different cities. I believe that this 'between worlds'\
  \ experience I had as a child, has shaped me into the traveler I am today, and I\
  \ don't regret a thing. \n\nI am grateful, thankful and will continue living my\
  \ life this way. \nExplore the good and the bad of this globe, as it is the only\
  \ way you will improve your mind and soul."
