Text: "Mom and I decided on this last minute trip to Cuba to escape the maritime cold.\
  \ Quickly booked some casas particulares across the country and decided to \"wing\
  \ it\" for a couple of nights. This, we agree, would allow us to be free to discover\
  \ new villages or new experiences. And that, we did. \n\nArrived in Havana, after\
  \ a quick night in Varadero, only with our backpacks, few snacks and my visa card\
  \ with a low limit and my mom with her credit card. Yes, you are right. She was\
  \ going to pay for most of the trip, her card did not have a limit. Being a good\
  \ daughter, I paid for the first few days but I quickly reached my limit with only\
  \ 200 dollars in our pockets. \n\nNo problem, my mom said, Ill go to the bank and\
  \ get money. We still have 5 days and we havent booked any casas particulares once\
  \ we come back from Vinales. \n\nOn our way to drinking a cerveza, we stopped at\
  \ an ATM. Punched in the codes and... Beep. The card is refused. We tried again,\
  \ same noise and same message. Quickly, our plan for beer fell through and we realized\
  \ we needed to find another ATM. We did 4 banks, and all had the same message.\n\
  \nScared, nervous and honestly thirsty, we headed back to our apartment. Sat down\
  \ with a piece of paper and calculated our budget. 200$ would get u from and back\
  \ to Vinales with 100$ in our pocket. We still had to book 2 nights and go back\
  \ to Varadero. We had just enough for those expenses. We counted the food we had,\
  \ and planned our meals. \n\nRealizing that surviving on granola wouldnt be the\
  \ best idea, I decided to knock on our neighbor's door.  This young, beautiful,\
  \ tanned and shirtless man opened the door and looked as surprised as me. Hola,\
  \ he said all excited, and my response, flirty as usual, no no hola necesito ayuda\
  \ (I need help). The mood changed and I explained our situation.  He nicely explained\
  \ that he had no clue how to help but his friend who works in tourism was coming\
  \ over tonight and he might know. \n\nMom and I waited all night, stressed and trying\
  \ to eat our papaya. He never came. We realized we had to find our own way. However,\
  \ faith had a different idea.  Loud knocks at the door made us de stress and I opened\
  \ the door to our neighbor. He told me his friend was over and I shouls come see\
  \ him. Mom stayed in the apartment and I followed the stranger into his apartment.\
  \ \n\n\nHis was empty. Our apartment made for tourist had furniture, sofa, and a\
  \ tv. His had two plastic chair in the middle of the room facing each other. His\
  \ friend sitting on one of them. He gestured for me to do the same.  At that moment,\
  \ in a dark, empty room, I realized my mom probably would be able to live with the\
  \ $200, since I could be kidnap. The entire scene felt like a movie. \n\nWithin\
  \ minutes, I realized I was wrong. I remembered once again that people around the\
  \ world were nice if you were nice to them. These two men, listened to me speak\
  \ in poor Spanish, listened to my fear and offered advice. He explained where we\
  \ should go, how to get there and even made a call to see if they were opened today.\n\
  \nI left feeling thankful to meet these two men, who like most people in Cuba have\
  \ nothing to their names."
