Text: "While in Berlin a friend and I went on a walking tour and were shown many wonderful\
  \ sights, and just past the Brandenburg Gate, there is a one of Berlins many magnificent\
  \ memorials called Holocaust Memorial. It is a memorial built of pillars that gradually\
  \ get bigger and bigger, one of the amazing things is as you get closer to the center\
  \ of the memorial, there is a haunting almost sinister silence that grows. No one\
  \ knows what the architect, Peter Eisenman, and engineer, Buro Happold, intended,\
  \ the two of them apparently decided they wanted people to discover what it meant\
  \ to themselves. \n   The tour guide told us that many thought it was to imitate\
  \ how the Jews must have felt during the Holocaust, being focused into an environment\
  \ where they are forced into silence, and where their existence felt dark and meaningless.\
  \ As you walk through the pillars that gradually loom over you, you can not help\
  \ but feel alone and a slight worry sets in. \n   This memorial draws people from\
  \ the present to the past, and gives us a taste of what it must have been like,\
  \ and reminds us all what can happen if we forget our pasts."
