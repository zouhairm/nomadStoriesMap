Text: "I tried to write poems in Berlin, about J and Hanna and other things, but afterwards\
  \ back in Rome poetic spirit deserted me, as did remaining money, and it was time\
  \ to look for a job.\nI found one in a bistro called BISTROT near Fontana di Trevi.\n\
  Bernini's white marble Fontana di Trevi is a beautiful piece of Italian Baroque.\
  \ It is also the No1 attraction in the Eternal City and thus packed with tourists\
  \ longing for that perfect instagrammable moment. If you throw in a coin, you will\
  \ surely return. Many people do and so the fountain needs to be cleaned thrice a\
  \ week lest it get full.\nOnly one staff member at BISTROT was Italian: Tina the\
  \ cook. Then there was Egyptian Karim who I was terrified of since I saw him use\
  \ a giant prosciutto cutter. I could not stop imagining its sharp little knives\
  \ running thru my jugular. Karim made pizza.\nAnd then there were us, ragazze of\
  \ mostly (except for Fanny from Peru) Slavic origin. Cristina was Moldovan, Sara\
  \ Ukrainian, as was Lucia, Lenka who got me the job was Czech and so on, to the\
  \ point that a fat man from a nearby restaurant made rhymes about it:\nUcrainiana\
  \ lo fa alla pecorina\nMoldavana ciuccia la banana.\nOur foreign backgrounds, however,\
  \ did not prevent us from having to follow a decidedly Italian price system: coffee\
  \ for Romans 90c, for Italians 1\u20AC, for tourists 2,5.\nCiambellone for Italians\
  \ (and i bangladini, immigrants selling roses/keychains/umbrellas/napkins/hot chesnuts):\
  \ 1\u20AC, for tourists: anything upwards of 3,5 goes. Food prices were even more\
  \ complicated, the same meal would sometimes cost 4\u20AC and sometimes 14, depending\
  \ on variables such as the weather, the time and the cadence of one's Ciao.\nUnable\
  \ to remember it all and ashamed to scam kindly British seniors doing their miserable\
  \ best to talk to me in my presumed mother tongue, my reluctance to comply with\
  \ the system earned me much scorn from other staff. The worst was Lucia. Just about\
  \ everything I did made her seethe:\nYou need to use some brain in life.\nMove useless\
  \ girl, better I do it.\nYou call this coffee? I call it piss!\nLucia (originally\
  \ Sveta, \u0421\u0432\u0456\u0442\u043B\u0430\u0301\u043D\u0430) was 29, remarkably\
  \ unfriendly, blonde and pretty in a way I found bland at the time. A hairdresser\
  \ who at one point owned a salon but lost it for reasons undisclosed, a mother \u2013\
  \ a photo of three-year-old Erika as her phone background. Most importantly, she\
  \ never returned any of my toothy smiles.\n\"I don't understand why you came to\
  \ Italy,\" she muttered once. \"You have it good in your country, no? There are\
  \ jobs in Slovakia. You are rich. Not like Ukraine, war, brother killing brother.\"\
  \ She looked me again, shaking her head: \"go mop floor, eh? Do it right this time.\"\
  \ This was somewhat enlightening at last. I may never understand Lucia's antipathy\
  \ towards me, but at least I learned to ditch my attempts at friendship.\nUntil\
  \ one day:\n\"Who was that?\" she barked when a guy chatting with me paid 90c for\
  \ an espresso and left.\n\"My ex came to annoy me, the coglione,\" I shrugged shoulders,\
  \ proud to have a man desire me enough to try and win me back after I broke his\
  \ heart.\nLucia went downstairs to grab napkins and that was supposedly the end\
  \ of it.\nHer hand on my shoulder startled me. I jumped and found her eyes, usually\
  \ so blunt, staring at me with concern.\n\"You said he is giving you trouble. He\
  \ wants your money?\" she asked in that hoarse voice of hers.\n\"No, not at all!\"\
  \ \nBut Lucia wouldn't believe me, especially not once she saw poor Gianfranco in\
  \ front of BISTROT leaning on the wall in a conveniently shadowy spot, all shoulders\
  \ in his big jacket, towards the end of our shift. She dug nails into my arm: \"\
  be careful... brava...\"\nLater she even hugged me, shortly, awkwardly: only after\
  \ much convincing did she concede that I go alone to a nearby bus stop.\nShe kept\
  \ being considerably warmer after that, and though I do not know who exactly do\
  \ I owe Lucia's change of heart, I am grateful for it. Asshole."
