Text: "A few images never leave your head. You see something - the kind of thing that\
  \ jumps far beyond the easy clickbait and teasing, taunting selfies - and it remains\
  \ with you until you're lying prostrate in a hospital room with the beeps and lines\
  \ and intrusive nurses all around. \n\nThe woman, your new wife, is sitting on the\
  \ rooftop ledge of the private villa overlooking a lunar Moroccan landscape. You\
  \ cannot see the minaret but the adhan is sounding its way between your ears and\
  \ the Atlas Mountains at sunset. As you watch her watch the sunset, you wonder if\
  \ the melodic prayer is telling you that God is a woman. Certainly, she is great.\n\
  \nI captured this image sans camera as it happened and I revisit it often - each\
  \ time replaying the serenity of that moment as often as I have to repeat the name\
  \ of the town - Ouarzazate - to get it right. \n\nOur honeymoon was a patchwork\
  \ of economy and whimsy. We took cheap flights through London and Madrid to arrive\
  \ in Marrakech, but we spent more on the villa and struck out alone to drive west\
  \ to the seaside town Essaouira. We spent lavishly, extravagantly on the divorce\
  \ seven years later, but that's a self discovery story for another time.\n\nOn a\
  \ layover, a well-worn couple inquired about our destination and, to their shock,\
  \ Morocco was not a place for honeymooners. The plane was delayed for several hours\
  \ but, despite that, our driver remained waiting at Menara International Airport\
  \ until two in the morning. As we stepped through customs, we found him at peace\
  \ and asleep on a bench with a sign, our newlywed names, across his stomach. Graciously,\
  \ he jumped to attention and escorted us through the parking lot to his car. In\
  \ the darkness, he played soft Arabic music. We could not communicate with him as\
  \ we passed by illuminated royal palaces during the small hours of the night. He\
  \ was silent as we escaped Marrakech to the countryside approximately 13 kilometers\
  \ from Ouarzazate (Ouarzazate, Ouarzazate, Ouarzazate).\n\nThe moment he stepped\
  \ from the car to open the gate at the end of a stony street we knew this was either\
  \ a kidnapping or an adventure. The gate revealed much more. Behind it was an oasis\
  \ - a brightly-lit entrance to a garden villa at the edge of the world and hidden\
  \ beneath the cover of centuries-old olive trees. We spent days poolside in the\
  \ desert. She receive a bridal henna treatment. Nearly daily, we ventured to the\
  \ souks and haggled with vendors selling spices and silver. Once, we were given\
  \ a prediction of our high fertility rate by assessing the soles of our feet. (We\
  \ have two children.) \n\nTraveling through North Africa provides a sense of adventure\
  \ and not a small amount of danger. There are endless opportunities to witness the\
  \ natural beauty of places and people. But no matter the dangers that lie ahead,\
  \ whether external or interpersonal, whether in transit or at a point of destination,\
  \ that beauty can be defining. I still have an image that I carry with me of her\
  \ hair like streaming banners in the Moroccan desert at sunset high above the olive\
  \ trees. That memory will last my entire lifetime."
