Text: "When I first learned about the World nomads travel writing scholarship in 2017,\
  \ I never wanted anything more than that. You see, challenges always  fire me up.\
  \ But here was a minute problem. I hadn't travel. And I didn't have a story.\n\n\
  So I decided to do what most girls in a 'not safe for women' India can only dream\
  \ of. Travel solo. In hope, that a story might follow .\n\nIt did. In ways I didn't\
  \ quite expect.\n\nKashmir has been always described in literature as paradise,\
  \ jannat. I have no intention to say otherwise but maybe the story will.\n\nWith\
  \ sun glazing down, I boarded a bus to Srinagar, from Jammu, at  9 am on a weary\
  \ April morning, and something told me it was going to be a long day.\n\nI hoped\
  \ into the bus, found a window seat in the 3rd row. At the next collecting stop,\
  \ a woman, in her forties, came and sat next to me. Now, this woman isn't the one\
  \ you would look forward to have a conversation with. Her head was covered with\
  \ a scarf, face set in an emotion of tightness , with such sadness that one didn't\
  \ imagine humans were capable of achieving. \nShe wasn't interested in having a\
  \ conversation and I  too , was occupied in observing the beautiful roads and valleys\
  \ , we were going through.\nBut after a while, I was bored. After some hesitation\
  \ I asked her,\n\" Aapa (elder sister), would you mind telling about a few places\
  \ to visit in Srinagar where I can find something worth a story ?\"\nShe stared\
  \ back with ,what it seemed, to be a reproach. Without a word, she rummaged through\
  \ her greyish leather purse and pulled out a pen and paper.\nShe wrote something\
  \ and handed me over. And then she looked away.\n\nIt was written in Urdu, an address\
  \ and a name, Noorjahan.\n\nShe got down some stops before me but I had a booking\
  \ for night in Srinagar \nBut the next afternoon , I found myself standing in one\
  \ of the most ignored, scarred and ill fated village of Poshpara.\nIt seemed the\
  \ air was heavy, stenched with drained emotions but I had an address to find.\n\n\
  With a helpful native, I soon reached the house, which is an overstatement because\
  \ it was a shack. With tin roofs. And unpainted walls. I knocked.\n\nAfter a few\
  \ minutes, Noorjahan opened.\n The look on her face was priceless. She hadn't clearly\
  \ expected me to take up her bait. She lived alone with nobody but walls that have\
  \ been a witness to her fate, to hear her wails at nights.  But she made me feel\
  \ welcome.\n\nWith a cup of Kahawa, the traditional drink of Kashmir, we sat down\
  \ on a thin mattress , barely covering the floor. And then she told me her story.\n\
  \nOn Feb 23 1991, around 11 pm Noorjahan was playing with her toys , just like 10\
  \ yrs girls are expected to do, when she heard the sound of gunshots. Not sure what\
  \ to do, she ran to her mother. After a few minutes , there was a knock at her door,\
  \ then a heavy sound of kicking and within seconds, a throng of soldiers with big\
  \ guns had taken over her house. With no father and brother to step in between,\
  \ they were completely defence less. She was tore away from her mother and saw her\
  \ mother being raped. Repeatedly. In the morning, the perpetrators left.\nHer mother\
  \ died a few years later, of the trauma. She was one of the few women from the village\
  \  who tried to fight for justice but never got it.\nAt just age of 18, she was\
  \ orphaned but was taken care of by her mother's sister for few years. She never\
  \ got married and now bids her time by working as a domestic caretaker , her only\
  \ dream ,an independent Kashmir.\n\nWhen I got up to leave, Noorjahan held my hand.\
  \ I promised her that I will make sure that her story reaches to everyone I know.\
  \ We hugged , and I resumed my first solo journey, in search of more stories."
