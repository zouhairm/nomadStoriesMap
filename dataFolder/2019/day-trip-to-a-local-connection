Text: "There are many trips that I have taken. Most to visit family in Houston or\
  \ South Carolina. Others were to Galveston Beach in Texas with friend. None were\
  \ as memorable as the trip I took to Tybee Island with my sister and boyfriend for\
  \ the day. I usually work Monday through Friday at a desk job and on the weekends,\
  \ I work at CVS as a cashier. I\u2019m usually always tired and don\u2019t really\
  \ want to do anything. So, occasionally my boyfriend would surprise me with a day\
  \ trip to Lake Lanier, which is north of Atlanta, Georgia. This time was no different.\
  \ Noticing my tired state, he realized a day away from everything would be good\
  \ for me. He even went as far as asking my sister to come with us because he was\
  \ okay with making it a family affair. With that my sister, my boyfriend, and myself\
  \ started the four-hour drive to Tybee Island.\n     When we arrived at Tybee Island,\
  \ the smell of the ocean and swap mix together in our noses. Just that smell eased\
  \ my stress and relaxed me. Right away, I forgot about my mundane life in Atlanta\
  \ and thanked my boyfriend for bringing me to a place that was filled with God\u2019\
  s beautiful creations. When stopped by the beach and took off our shoe so we could\
  \ feel the sand under our feet. As we walked up and down the beach, we were mesmerized\
  \ by the ocean waves and watching the seagulls catch fish. Out in the distance we\
  \ could see a large speed boat pass by and a whale blow water out of its blowhole.\
  \ It was all beautiful. \n     Once we were done with the ocean and was ready to\
  \ take the four-hour trip back home, we decided to stop by one of the local ice\
  \ cream shops. This shop was located on the end of a restaurant that was across\
  \ the street from the ocean. The lady that ran the shop was extremely nice and told\
  \ about the best flavored ice cream she had. However, meeting her was the icing\
  \ on the top of the cake. I told her about my dream to travel the world and become\
  \ a travel writer and she showed me a map of the world. On the map were push pins\
  \ of the places people who have visited the ice cream shop were from. She said it\
  \ was her goal to have a pin in every continent on the map. As I looked and observed\
  \ the map, I notice she had a pin of at least four of the seven continents. She\
  \ told me that could be an idea for me. I could get a map and pin the places I visit\
  \ and when I have stopped my traveling, I would have many stories to tell my children.\
  \ \n     Meeting her and visiting Tybee helped me connect to the outside world a\
  \ little better. I have a better idea of the places I would like to visit, and I\
  \ am not as stressed out as I was before the trip. I hope that one day I will be\
  \ able to connect with others and other places around the world like I connected\
  \ with Tybee Island and its natives."
