Text: "The first thing I remember is standing on platform number 1 of Vadodara railway\
  \ station. A train headed to Mumbai shows up and blows its loud, protracted horn,\
  \ as if to announce, \u201CThis is not a dream, Alice. It\u2019s happening. You\
  \ ready?\u201D\n\nThe next day, as my parents drop me off at the airport, all I\
  \ can think of is the beauty and craziness of how this trip came to be. I check\
  \ in my luggage, help an old Gujarati couple text their son that they\u2019re coming\
  \ through Newark instead of JFK, and pass security checks. Every cell in my body\
  \ feels fully alive, attentive, and in genuine anticipation of whatever happens\
  \ next for the first time in my life.\n\nI board the flight at 2:10 AM. Window seat,\
  \ obviously. Feel a little cramped in and uncomfortable at first, but I quickly\
  \ settle in. After takeoff, even in the dark of the night, the view is something.\
  \ Streets are reduced to lines of light, a William Gibson-worthy sprawl of modern\
  \ human activity relegated to geometric and electric patterns.\n\nI wake up, foggy\
  \ with fragmented sleep, to an announcement that we would be landing in Paris soon.\
  \ Outside the glass window, a July sunrise greets my eyes. After we land, my co-passengers\
  \ and I politely stumble out of the plane in a queue, and are met with the words\
  \ \u201CBienvenue \xE0 Paris\u201D. \n\nMy 19-year-old mind cannot believe the flood\
  \ of sensory information it is receiving. Not only had I never traveled out of India,\
  \ I had never even been on a plane before. And I was only halfway through my journey.\n\
  \nI buy a chocolate croissant and coffee. I pick up a copy of the day\u2019s Le\
  \ Monde and unfold it before me, even though I\u2019d scored a D- on my Intro to\
  \ French class just weeks ago. It makes me feel smart and sophisticated: a worldly\
  \ man casually flipping through the newspaper in the middle of Charles de Gaulle\
  \ airport, someone who is destined for wonderful things, but also knows the importance\
  \ of taking the time to unwind. \n\nThe next flight is to Atlanta, my final destination.\n\
  \nToday, writing this, I want to travel back in time, meet that starry-eyed 19-year-old,\
  \ and tell him how the next week will completely transform the way he lives his\
  \ life. I want to tell him about Emory University, about the rains in Georgia, and\
  \ about that impossibly delicious fried chicken taco. I want to ask him to savor\
  \ the experiences, and let all their warm wisdom lead him to more solo trips.\n\n\
  But as sworn movie geeks, we both despise spoilers. And he\u2019ll know all of this\
  \ (and more) soon enough.\n\nAs I trudge out of security checks at Hartsfield-Jackson,\
  \ blasted out of normal consciousness by the menace of intercontinental jet-lag,\
  \ I recognize Daniel. He is holding up a sign with my name on it. This man who invited\
  \ me, whom I\u2019ve never met before, in this country I\u2019ve never been to before,\
  \ sees me and smiles. When I reach him, he gives me a hug.\n\n\u201CWelcome.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CThank you for having me,\u201D I tell him.\n\n\u201CYou ready?\u201D\n\
  \nI nod, unsure. \n\nFourteen hours later, after I\u2019ve caught up on my sleep\
  \ and had a generous, life-affirming breakfast, I\u2019m asked to choose between\
  \ a surface-level tour of the city and a comprehensive one.\n\nI choose the latter,\
  \ because I have this inexplicable feeling that future me will thank me for it."
