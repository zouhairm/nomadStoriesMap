Text: "Along the shoddily cobbled streets of Bar\xE3o de s\xE3o Jo\u0101o, the dancing\
  \ scent of sweet bread permeates the air, fresh from the bakery on the corner. Rugged\
  \ men stumble haphazardly from doorsteps equipped with brown bottles of 'crystal',\
  \ an early morning tipple to start their day. A small white scruffy dog sniffs at\
  \ my feet uninvitedly and, trots off purposefully towards the butchers opposite\
  \ the laundrette. At this point, the August sun is beaming down and ricocheting\
  \ light from discarded cans and empty bottles littered adjacent to the bin. \nOddly\
  \ enough, I can't help but feel like I'm being watched. The almost iridescent curtains\
  \ of the quaint little houses twitch and flow, but there is no wind today, not even\
  \ a slight summer breeze. A stocky lady appears as if from nowhere and proceeds\
  \ to fling a bucket of brown soapy water across the cobbles, creating a small flood\
  \ allowing water to seep through the cracks in the cal\xE7ada, like intricate rivers\
  \ searching for a route to the sea. \nThe white dog returns to sight hastily with\
  \ a bone almost the length of his body. He, who I have now named Goliath paddles\
  \ through the water and settles in a puddle, relieved by the cooling stream, and\
  \ begins gnawing with sweet determination.\n\nUnexpectedly, I catch amble sight\
  \ of an elderly lady sporting a brightly coloured pinafore with a Coq de Barcellos\
  \ motif move from behind a door. The deeply ingrained lines on her face look like\
  \ the hollows of WW2 trenches, they certainly mimic the pain. Her eyes appear lost\
  \ to her withdrawn sockets. She looks at me as though I am trespassing defiantly\
  \ on sacred land. Unnerved by this silent confrontation, I turn and make a hurried\
  \ retreat. As I turn, I lose my footing and slip on the wet cobbles, which causes\
  \ me to tumble not so elegantly to the ground. Goliath is unstirred by my clumsy\
  \ plummet.\n\nAnother curtain twitches behind me, but this time I catch the culprit\
  \ staring straight into my soul, but with much kinder eyes than before. Her sunkissed\
  \ face looks mildly familiar to me. But, entirely unplaceable. I blink twice and\
  \ catch more shadowed figures closing in on my periphery, and emerging from terracotta\
  \ lined doorways. They appear stoic like chess pieces, waiting to make their move.\
  \ Before I can make my next move, the kind-faced woman swoops down from her perch\
  \ and helps me to my feet, like an angel sent from above. She pulls me close, and\
  \ I immediately feel a sense of calm and ease. She whispers in my ear;\n\n\"Our\
  \ elders see everything, they keep us safe. We don't need security cameras like\
  \ other cultures, we have our elders keeping order from behind the shields of curtains\
  \ and doors. They are Portugals best-kept secret.\""
