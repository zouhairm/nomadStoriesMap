Text: "On the road to Thar, there are no gourmet restaurents or gas stations, selling\
  \ somewhat mildly edible sandwiches. \n\nWhen driving upon the cattle-infested,\
  \ dusty and broken tracks on the road to Thar, you are less likely to come across\
  \ a KFC branch as you are going to come across something, called a dhabba. \n\n\
  Dhabbas are the KFC of Pakistan. No, scratch that. Dhabbas are way better and much\
  \ more organic than KFC will ever be. Our stomachs were groaning in symphony at\
  \ the eve of our trip, so we were forced to pull all our stops at a seemingly inconspicuous\
  \ dhabba. \n\nNow being a Pakistani, who tends to visit the country once every year\
  \ approximately, I am well acquainted with the dhabba culture. Sitting cross-legged\
  \ on woven charpoys, swatting off flies, sipping burnt chai and munching on parathas\
  \ dipped in ghee. \n\nBut I was not prepared for the stench. No one was. \n\nMind\
  \ you, we were headed to a desert; so we were surrounded by farming settlements\
  \ and grazing sheep, all around. This particular dhabba was littered with heavy-set\
  \ bearded men, cradling dainty cups of tea on their laps. Since our party consisted\
  \ of an equal number of men and women, we were shown into the \"family\" section\
  \ of the eatery, facing an array of cowsheds at the back. Yes you read that right.\
  \ Cowsheds. Only a flimsy curtain seperated us from the gentle giants in the back.\
  \ \n\nWell, gentle giants with massive bladder issues. \n\nThe smell was unbearable.\
  \ I have lived all my life in a Gulf Country and I've always wanted to experience\
  \ a real village life. Here I was, experiencing it, and wanting to gag at the same\
  \ time. I can only describe the scent as a cross between a moldy diaper, and wet\
  \ earth. None of them pleasant. \n\nThe waiter arrived with our steaming cups of\
  \ chai and parathas, which we attacked like a pack of hungry wolves. But there was\
  \ still something quite different about the chai. I was surrounded by friends and\
  \ family who chug ten cups of chai in day, so they were immune to any distinct flavourings\
  \ in it. I sipped it cautiously and sniffed it a couple of times. \n\nFeeling more\
  \ and more at unease, I asked the waiter how he prepared the chain. The jumpy little\
  \ man that he was, rattled off a list of ingredients I was familiar with. Until\
  \ my cousin who was sitting on the far end of the table, added with his mouth full,\
  \ \"Oh and it's cooked on dried out cow-dung patties\". \n\nSomewhere in the midst\
  \ of this revelation, the cows in the shed mooed simultaneously, as if to mock at\
  \ my prissiness and take a piss out of it. I had forgotten that in order for me\
  \ to experience the 'real deal', I had to do just that - experience it. I sipped\
  \ my chai in complete silence while pinching my nose after that."
