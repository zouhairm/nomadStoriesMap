Text: "I watched Captain Tom stoop slightly and shelter his pipe with his hands, cupping\
  \ the wooden bowl and attempting to light the tobacco inside. I looked the man over,\
  \ thinking to myself \"that is the most Scottish man I've ever seen.\" Standing\
  \ at least two heads above me with black hair gone mostly white, a beard that looked\
  \ much the same, and twinkling, almost feline, blue eyes, he looked every bit the\
  \ part of the Scottish captain. His image replete with a solid, plaid cap pulled\
  \ low over his eyes, a knitted cream-colored sweater, and the pipe, puffing away\
  \ happily now, stuck firmly between his teeth. \n\tThe sun was beginning to drop\
  \ down past the horizon by the time we made our way to the restaurant Tom had found\
  \ for our first night out. I was still entirely unsure of the dinghy that we had\
  \ to use to get to and from the boat, but there wasn\u2019t much of a choice about\
  \ it. I managed to get down into the dinghy with Captain Tom and my uncle followed.\n\
  We had all gotten situated, precariously balancing and waiting for Captain Tom to\
  \ start the little engine that clung to the side of the dinghy. Tom pulled the cord,\
  \ attempting to start the engine. I was just beginning to worry that the engine\
  \ had given up when we heard an almighty snap. The cord had pulled off the engine.\
  \ I looked over at the Captain. He wore a most peculiar expression, glancing between\
  \ the cord and engine and then over to us. I couldn't help but laugh. Soon we were\
  \ all laughing, clutching our sides. I was still chuckling softly to myself when\
  \ Captain Tom said \"weel, I guess it's the oars then.\" My laughter stopped immediately.\
  \ It was cold. I'm not very strong. It was dark.\nIt took us roughly twenty minutes,\
  \ but we finally made it, pulled ourselves out of the water, strung up our dinghy,\
  \ and made our way to the restaurant. We had a grand time. We ate, we talked, we\
  \ laughed far too loudly. By the time the meal was through, we were full and bordering\
  \ on drunk and we agreed we should head back. As we came to the end of the dock\
  \ where our dinghy rested, a realization hit; we had to paddle back.\nWe made it\
  \ back to the boat. After much paddling. Much water in our shoes. Much beer holding\
  \ (my uncle couldn\u2019t bear to part with his leftover beer). Much teeth chattering.\
  \ But we made it back. We talked long into the night until my uncle declared he\
  \ couldn\u2019t stay up a minute longer.\nI was just about to climb into bed when\
  \ Tom, above deck, called for me. I tugged on my boots and jacket, braced myself\
  \ for the cold, and headed out. It was pitch black. All the lights in the boat were\
  \ off. The only sound was the gentle lapping of the water against the boat. The\
  \ Captain pointed out a few constellations then slipped back down into the cabin.\n\
  I stood above deck with my head craned back, mouth agape, staring at the heavens\
  \ above me, taking in the beautiful brilliance of the stars. To the left and right\
  \ of me I could hear a strange rushing sound: swollen rivers rushing down the sides\
  \ of the mountains, breaking against rocks and trees, slowly wearing a track into\
  \ the mountains, older than human memory. Mountains that had existed long before\
  \ me and would continue to exist long after I was gone. The sounds of nature all\
  \ around me, breathing, living, growing.\nI opened my eyes again and took in the\
  \ stars while my ears took in the rushing rivers. I was at peace. It was the most\
  \ peaceful moment of my life. Myself, and the stars above,  the sound of the rivers,\
  \ the clean, cool, fresh smell of the ocean, and the smell of the Highlands. This,\
  \ I thought, is what Scotland is in my mind. This is the romance. Not between two\
  \ people, but between one person and the land.\nAs that famous Scot once said, \u201C\
  My heart is in the Highland\u201D."
