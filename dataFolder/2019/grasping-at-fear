Text: "\u201CPlease return to your seats. For your safety ensure that your safety\
  \ belt is on.\u201D \n\nDistracted by my thoughts I fail to hear the entirety of\
  \ the pilot\u2019s announcement. What have I gotten myself into? I am mid-air between\
  \ quarreling borders; leaving my husband and five-year old son 7,754 miles behind\
  \ me in rural New Zealand, I am living out my childhood dream of experiencing India.\
  \ Anxious, I imagine land shot missiles ripping through the aircraft. As swiftly\
  \ as the image enters my head I am brought back to reality by the relentless pulsating\
  \ of trepidation. This is the furthest I have travelled past my Oceanic neighbours.\
  \ Having read countless blogs and the travel advice of solo women travellers, I\
  \ am armed with a breadth of knowledge. All that awaits me now is the journey itself.\n\
  \nAs I stand silently on the descending escalator in the Indira Gandhi International\
  \ Airport, an abbreviated version of my checklist cycles repeatedly through my head\
  \ \u2013 convert money, buy sim card, order taxi. Greeted by the copper casts of\
  \ nine mudra sculptures - abhaya mudr\u0101 \u2013 be fearless, is weighted above\
  \ me. There is something poetic about the act of being fearless. It is fear that\
  \ suffocates and constricts every internal vessel of my being, the same fear that\
  \ with each heavy slow-paced inhale expands the notion of fearlessness. I carry\
  \ within my luggage the energy of protection stones and the obscureness of my fears\
  \ and of those close to me. Friends, family and colleagues commending me for my\
  \ braveness of venturing into the unknown, gratuitously spreading undertones of\
  \ admonishment for daring to leave the familiarity of home.\n\nOverhead signage\
  \ indicates where I need to be. My focus is fixed firmly on the checklist: currency\
  \ exchange, Airtel, pre-paid taxi. Nervously counting my rupees, I intentionally\
  \ avoid any needless conversations. Inserting the sim-card into the side of my iPhone,\
  \ my hands quiver inconspicuously. I am overcome with adrenaline; I have spent months\
  \ preparing for this moment. In front of the glass-paneled doors, I steady my breathing\
  \ and move forward. Bracing myself for what is behind the opening, I step out. Engulfed\
  \ by the stench of densely penetrating warmth, a blur of identities stand before\
  \ me. A stranger approaches, ushering me to the side. \u201CPlease, come, your taxi.\u201D\
  \ My mind fogged by the deafening of my thoughts, I halt, no, I have a taxi waiting.\
  \ \u201CYes, see here, your taxi ma\u2019am.\u201D  Suspiciously scanning the unassuming\
  \ sedan, I match the license plate to the scribble on my yellow lined receipt. I\
  \ feel, foreign. I follow the driver to his car. \u201CMadhuban Hotel?\u201D Yes,\
  \ the Madhuban. \n\nFrantically feeling around for the seatbelt clasp my heart is\
  \ palpitating to no end. Where. Is. The. Clasp?! I scream silently, grasping the\
  \ belt over my shoulder for comfort. I had visually memorized the directions and\
  \ street names beforehand, it offers a sense of control as the driver pulls out\
  \ of the airport compound and into the bellowing of horns. The driver\u2019s curious\
  \ eyes flick back and forth between the rearview mirror and road; skillfully he\
  \ navigates the nonsensical disarray of traffic. Bedlam is the word to describe\
  \ it. We come to a stop. Street peddlers rush out. Amass with their wares they reign\
  \ above the chaos. \n\nThe echoing of scurrying is to all sides of me. I shake my\
  \ head at the hawker, seemingly nonchalant about what he has on offer. I can hear\
  \ my heart pounding over the jolting cars and resolute accents. A young boy carrying\
  \ wilted roses peers into my window, \u201Cma\u2019am, ma\u2019am\u201D he nods\
  \ towards the florals. Avoid eye contact. I awkwardly smile and he fades away. I\
  \ spy a woman wrapped in layered cloudy chiffon, perched on the corner of the highway\
  \ she peels back the subdued green of cornhusks \u2013 everything around me appears\
  \ to be coloured with dust. The woman glances ahead. I follow her gaze. A small-unperturbed\
  \ child, less than school age sits amongst a mound of plastic encased roses. Rhythmically\
  \ tapping a bare twig in the dirt, I find my breath and heartbeat in her movement.\
  \ I exhale the fear of the fearless, and arrive at my journey."
