Text: "Waving to my grandfather and family at the door, I set off on a journey nobody\
  \ including myself thought would be straight forward. The Aspergers teen with his\
  \ anxiety versus an inner wanderlust that was never going to let fear control his\
  \ life. Arriving at the downtown metro station in Tehran with everything stuffed\
  \ into the smallest backpack. I pulled out my rail ticket, Destination Haydarpasa\
  \ Istanbul. With nothing booked as usual I for the first time in my life wondered\
  \ if I'd make it home, my plan being to return to Manchester via land and sea. Before\
  \ leaving Id told everyone I had everything set. yet I was broke from all the spending\
  \ done whilst dating a beautiful persian girl I'd fell in lust with whilst in Tehran.\
  \ If only I wasnt so gullible I would have still had what usual travellers have\
  \ ( enough money!) regardless I entered my cabin on the train to be greeted by a\
  \ family of the same family name \"Salehi\". Strangely all looking similar and with\
  \ the same names. Shima, Ali and elaheh. They offered me chai and ghaz, a traditional\
  \ sweet of Iran. As the train set off I was sitting there using my broken farsi\
  \ discussing how life in England was different to Iran and sharing travel stories.\
  \ Soon after I was invited to the main restaurant cabin for dinner. On finishing\
  \ my food I turned to see people one by one bring in music instruments and soon\
  \ after embrace in song.  To an outsider it would have seemed as if everyone knew\
  \ each other to be so warm. A contrasting comparison to paint a picture would be\
  \ an English pub when hearing oasis play \U0001F3B6 or the dance scene out of the\
  \ film titanic. In this moment I was pulled to my feet to dance by Ali who was somehow\
  \ drunk whilst still being in the Islamic state territory. Once crossing the boarder\
  \ in to turkey this wouldn't have been a concern but In iran alcohol is illegal.\
  \ However in saying that the essence of persian spirit is around partying and so\
  \ people have their ways of finding a tipple when needs be. Ali must have sneaked\
  \ it and wanted to show me the Englishman that iranians too! can have fun. \U0001F389\
  \ \U0001F57AAfter I had danced to dehydration and laughed until abdominals appeared.\
  \ I walked back to my cabin for some peace and quiet. I jumped up into my bunk and\
  \ lay facing the window infront. As I looked out I was seeing the most amazing views\
  \ of the night sky \u2728 \U0001F303 . My mind drifted into thoughts of my friends\
  \ and family who would have loved to experience what I was but didnt and may never\
  \ see the world as theirs. Confined to four walls \U0001F3D8 and the typical package\
  \ holiday to benidorm. I felt blessed that my autistic ways had led me to always\
  \ look outside the box, outside the norms and outside the tourist guide. I had experienced\
  \ something that many others will never and that was to do what I loved even with\
  \ all my shyness. I drifted off happy and woke up the next morning with a view brighter\
  \ than my grin \u2600.  As I opened my curtain I could see beautiful mountains \u26F0\
  \ \U0001F5FB and scenery impossible to see whilst in the air. \U0001F6EC taking\
  \ a cheap Ryanair flight  is the quick option. It has its purpose but why pay 10\
  \ euros for a sandwich when you can extend your legs and eat breakfast with a view.\
  \ That morning I spent meeting new people who were outside their cabins talking\
  \ and taking photos from the windows .There was a mix of people from different cities.\
  \ Some international. All on the train heading to Istanbul for their own reasons.\
  \ A young boy came and said there was an old Indian couple at the other end of the\
  \ train who had asked me to join them in their cabin for lunch. I agreed and ended\
  \ up meeting two people I hope to be like. They both taught me a lesson in life\
  \ that I'll never forget . \"Travel whilst you are young and keep on travelling\
  \ until you can walk no more. Thank you guys for reading\" \u270C\uFE0F"
