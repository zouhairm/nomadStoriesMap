Text: "I look at my wrist, my vintage Cassio marks 6:04 p.m. I start to run, no jogging\
  \ or power walking, running. Like when you played baseball in recess trying to get\
  \ to first base and your whole team was cheering for you. My face starts to get\
  \ sweaty, my bag hits my arm and makes an annoying noise. I don\u2019t have time\
  \ to look back and see if something fell off my backpack along the way, I don\u2019\
  t think I would make it.  My feet touch the grassy land and all I can smell is fresh\
  \ grass. I also can\u2019t stop thinking I brought the wrong shoes for this trip.\n\
  The landscape is nice; some picturesque houses over the hill, vegetation grows free\
  \ without anything marking the way. I\u2019m pretty sure no one is watching me run\
  \ desperately, if someone was, I\xB4d probably look like I was escaping from something.\
  \ Maybe I was.  \nWhen I woke up that Sunday morning I didn\u2019t think I would\
  \ end up running alone in the middle of the forest trying to catch the 6:11 p.m.\
  \ train from Bohusovce to Prague. Since I started my semester abroad I\u2019ve wanted\
  \ to visit the Terezin Camp. Little I knew about this place, but I don\u2019t think\
  \ that anything would\xB4ve prepare me for the hours I spent there. Visiting a concentration\
  \ camp is a unique experience but doing it all by yourself gets even more interesting.\
  \  Walking through the hallways and barricades it all felt that it was evicted just\
  \ a few months ago. \nWhen you look up to the atrocities of World War 2, there are\
  \ few places that were left barely intact, Theresienstadt fortress is one of them.\
  \ Not as famous as the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp; but equally important.\
  \ Terezin Camp played a different role, a facade to hid the operation that killed\
  \ thousands. It may have seemed the main purpose of the camp was not death, but\
  \ of course death was there. \n\nSuddenly I realize that I\u2019m not the first\
  \ person this road has witnessed running. Probably 70 years ago a woman my age was\
  \ also running trying to catch up a train, but maybe for her that train meant life.\
  \  Maybe it was a mother looking for her children, or a father trying to get some\
  \ food or even perhaps a little girl running because she knew deep down that was\
  \ no the right place for her. \nI stop, I breathe and close my eyes. All the testimonies\
  \ that I\u2019ve read for the last couple hours at the museum come alive. The desperation,\
  \ the hope and the uncertainty. The feeling of being alone but at the same time\
  \ being watched. I would never know of course, but for just that moment I felt the\
  \ most lonely I\u2019ve ever been. It all starts to make a little sense. \nA tear\
  \ falls down my face. I\u2019m being witness of a lovely afternoon. The sky is gifting\
  \ me a beautiful mix of orange, white and light blue. It\xB4s chill, the perfect\
  \ weather for children to play outside. And then it hits me again, that for over\
  \ 33,430 people this was their last sunset. That the children would not come out\
  \ to play but work. And deep in my thoughts it occurs to me that this view can not\
  \ be taken way from anyone. That looking up, for hope, God or a sign it\u2019s our\
  \ natural right. \n\nIn the distance I hear the train but I\u2019m not running anymore.\
  \ I\u2019m just breathing it all in. Taking my time inhaling and exhaling, observing\
  \ the gift that nature allows me to witness and feeling a strange. I feel sad and\
  \ grateful at the same time. More grateful than ever because I am alive with the\
  \ hope of seeing another sunset again tomorrow.  But the sadness is overwhelming,\
  \ and I just can think: they didn\u2019t deserve it. I\u2019m breathing for all\
  \ the souls that had their last breath here. Trying to honor them but not sure of\
  \ doing it right. It doesn\xB4t matter, this is my way. \n\nAt the distance I hear\
  \ the train leaving the station, but I\u2019m not worried anymore, because for me\
  \ another train will come."
