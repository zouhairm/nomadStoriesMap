Text: "\u201CCalle Antonio Maceo, 472.. this must be it.\u201D A few hours after getting\
  \ off a bus full of tourists eager to explore the colonial town, we were standing\
  \ in front of the warped wooden door of Mireya. She was being recommended in our\
  \ guidebook as one of Trinidad\u2019s best teachers but was she still living behind\
  \ those mint-green walls? After all, our guidebook has been published several years\
  \ ago... \n\nWhen we planned our trip mid-December we were thrilled to be travelling\
  \ through a country with restricted access to everything, especially to the internet.\
  \ But this \u201Cromantic\u201D idea of travelling like in the \u201Cold days\u201D\
  \ through a communist country like Cuba quite soon lost its glamour. Right here,\
  \ right now, knocking on this door, I started to long for internet access to finally\
  \ find a Cuban dance instructor for me and my boyfriend.\n\nIt cannot be that hard\
  \ to find a dance teacher, can it? Well, in our case time was running out. Trinidad\
  \ lies right in the middle of the southern coast of the island but at the same time\
  \ almost at the end of our backpacking trip. Throughout our journey, we have seen\
  \ and admired many locals dancing publicly on squares, in front of dance schools\
  \ and Salsa clubs. This vitality and devotion have made us incredibly curious. So\
  \ one thing was for sure: If we were going to do a salsa lesson before flying back\
  \ home, it would have to be here. \n\n\u201CWhat do you want?\u201D The woman opening\
  \ the door was not quite what I had expected. I looked into the face of an elderly\
  \ woman trying to fight the midday heat by using an old fan. The sharp tone in her\
  \ voice made it obvious that she wasn\u2019t expecting any visitors or tourists\
  \ at this time of the day. \u201CWe are looking for Mireya.\u201D - \u201CYes, that\u2019\
  s me.\u201D Only moments later the squeaky door was closed again and we had our\
  \ first Salsa lesson scheduled for the next morning. Relieved and full of excitement\
  \ I turned to my boyfriend: \u201CGreat, that\u2019s settled, nothing can go wrong\
  \ now.\u201D\n\nPrecisely at 11 am. the next morning we entered Mireya\u2019s big\
  \ living room full of old raffia furniture. To keep the hot temperatures of the\
  \ Caribbean sun outside she had darkened all the barred windows, known as \u201C\
  rejas\u201D, with blinds. First, she showed us the basic steps: \u201C1, 2, 3...1,\
  \ 2, 3...1, 2, 3\u201D. Salsa music was filling the room while her strong voice\
  \ was repeating those words over and over again like a mantra. I would have liked\
  \ our steps to look as passionate, precise and effortless as those of the Cubans\
  \ but we both probably never felt more European in our life than right at this moment.\
  \ At some point, Mireya got up from her worn down TV chair, adjusted her hip belt\
  \ and started to dance with me.\n\nRegardless of her age and curves, she was literally\
  \ one with the Salsa rhythm, swirling me around like it was the most natural thing\
  \ to do. My boyfriend was watching her in awe when she suddenly turned to him with\
  \ a cheeky smile on her face: \u201CYou have to lead her. Dancing is the only moment\
  \ in life when a man leads, so you should take advantage of it.\u201D All three\
  \ of us started laughing - the ice and most importantly the physical tension was\
  \ now finally broken.\n\nMireya took Salsa very seriously, after all, her reputation\
  \ as a dance instructor was at stake. Before we finally left Mireya's home after\
  \ 2 intense hours, she gave us one last piece of advice along the way: \u201CNow\
  \ that you know how to dance Salsa, your life will change. From now on you have\
  \ to practise, practise, practise!\u201D We had to promise it to her before stepping\
  \ outside into the bright daylight and busy streets of Trinidad. I was relieved\
  \ and sad at the same time since for the first time on our 3-weeks lasting trip,\
  \ we had felt a real connection to the Cuban culture."
