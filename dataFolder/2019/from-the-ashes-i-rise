Text: "Like a bird with its prey, I was off again on a flight of curiosity, filled\
  \ with drive. Three times in the last year is how often I\u2019ve left the comfort\
  \ of my native island of Saint Croix to venture into the unknown in hopes of discovering\
  \ a part of me that was awaiting to be experienced. Three times is also the number\
  \ of times I\u2019ve returned home after every expedition took a wrong turn at destiny.\
  \ \nBeing back in the comfort of the familiar scent of sea salt in the breeze and\
  \ the orchestra performed by crickets at night sent storms of nostalgia through\
  \ me. Actually living here, and not going back and forth, gave me time to relish\
  \ in the quiet and soothing push and pull of island life. There\u2019s no fancy\
  \ clubs, no malls towering in the sky nor is there a lack of humanity. \nFrom the\
  \ supermarkets to the seashore, there is never a lack of home-grown island manners\
  \ of offering a friendly Good afternoon, or how are you. This isn\u2019t to say\
  \ the islands of the VI have not been affected by economic downfall and the environmental\
  \ disasters. \nIn 2017, The USVI was struck by two catergory five hurricanes that\
  \ not only destroyed lives but also sent the people into crisis mode. Crime took\
  \ an uprise and natives fled to the mainland in search of salvation. Upon arriving\
  \ just a month after the hurricane, my sense of home was crushed. \nFrom beaches\
  \ I splashed and played in as a child to trees I climbed to the very top of just\
  \ to get a peak at bird\u2019s eye view, all transformed. Some gone, some never\
  \ will be the same. The people relied on governmental help to get by and to also\
  \ bandage the damage to their lives. Some recovered and some are still recovering.\
  \ The amount of disaster and upheaval this brought, not only changed the island\
  \ but the people along with it. \nIn a year, we\u2019ve elected a new governor,\
  \ passed the legalization of medical marijuana, had our very first LGBTQ March of\
  \ pride and have even signed big money deals with Limetree, an oil company now based\
  \ on Saint Croix. \nYou can say change brings the best and worst out in people and\
  \ you can say the place has everything to do with it. But for me, this small 84\
  \ Sq miles piece of heaven has remained a place of refuge for the weak, the weary,\
  \ the driven, the old and the new. From the shorelines of East end to the Rainforest\
  \ of West end, my home has stood, grown and recovered from any tumultuous relationship\
  \ the people have had with life. The Mangoes are still sweet, the parade is still\
  \ filled with life and as for me, I\u2019m still somewhere on beach, one hand in\
  \ paradise and the other in helping form it."
