Text: "Moments whisper in my ears \u201CYou\u2019re living your dream!\u201D and I\
  \ keep searching for the perfect feeling I am supposed to have right this moment.\
  \ Is this how you feel when your distant dreams come so close to you? I wonder the\
  \ feeling that I always wanted to have deep down\u2026 being independent, alone\
  \ but not lonely. I wanted to be strong yet soft when I am around kids. I wanted\
  \ to be independent yet dependent on that someone who I can count on no matter what,\
  \ atleast one! I wanted to be aloof so that I don\u2019t get hurt when someone leaves\
  \ me. I wanted to run away before someone else leaves me. So, here I am in front\
  \ of this beautiful view out my window staring at Dublin sky, miles away from everything\
  \ I have ever known for the first time, living with an Irish family, learning how\
  \ to cook. I cherish my every first experience, like the first flight alone, the\
  \ first trip to Europe, The first view of the \u201CGreen\u201D land from the aeroplane.\
  \ My first British roommate! I was so scared thinking she may not even talk to me\
  \ but It was fun learning inspite of living in two different corners of the world\
  \ how so many things can be common between two people only if you ever choose to\
  \ see them as an equal, as someone just like you trying to figure out life. Yeah,\
  \ I keep saying this to myself these days that I am just figuring it out as much\
  \ I can. But Is this how you feel when you live your dream? Because it is not all\
  \ fairy tale or all happy! I miss my home terribly and my mom\u2019s food. I miss\
  \ my room and the common whispers around me are no more in my native language. I\
  \ feel so tired living in my dream that I don\u2019t stay up late at night anymore\
  \ infact the moment I rest my head on the pillow I fall deep asleep."
