Text: "Eighty kilometres, ninety, a hundred, rising. Who knew my middle-aged mother\
  \ in law would take turns this fast? \n\nFields and fences whizz by\u2014 we\u2019\
  re looking for the kangaroos that drink from waterholes at sunset. I\u2019m still\
  \ jetlagged, but the wind that buffets the convertible helps.\n\nThe moon is climbing.\
  \ My life before this instant falls away, away, away, back into the unknowing of\
  \ the invisible route behind. Where am I headed? There\u2019s nothing except this:\
  \ whatever happens, I\u2019ll never be this person again. Won\u2019t feel this way\
  \ again. \n\nBut I will remember this moment, in an Australian convertible, careening\
  \ towards the void and the kangaroos.\n\n\nDay 0\n\nI sit in the boarding area,\
  \ eyes clenched shut, hands tight around the straps of my backpack. I\u2019ve done\
  \ this so many times and, still, I don\u2019t want to. \u2018I should be elated\u2019\
  , my mind protests. Travelling across the world, Buenos Aires to Melbourne, to see\
  \ a long-distance lover. What could be better?\n\nWe met, careless, in Berlin. The\
  \ instant I saw him, I was certain I\u2019d never wanted anything before. We ran\
  \ around in grocery stores at 2 in the morning, kissed in museums, and, then, it\
  \ was over. Perhaps it should\u2019ve stayed that way. There\u2019s a quote I can\u2019\
  t recall, something about protecting the places that have made us happy. Even from\
  \ ourselves.\n\n\nNow, I stand on a cliff of marble, about to plunge into darkness.\
  \ Away from another love, away from everything familiar. The thing is\u2014 I haven\u2019\
  t recognised myself for a long time. \n\nI\u2019m living for nothing, but at least\
  \ I\u2019m keeping a record.\n\n\nDay 8\n\nI am awake. I know it abruptly, swift\
  \ as the sun has climbed over eucalyptus and cicadas, steadily scorching the world.\
  \ My phone, inside our impromptu sauna-tent, says 9 a.m. Cockatoo crows. Cockatoo\
  \ sounds like a made-up word, like brekkie, arvo, mozzies. They\u2019re all real,\
  \ though. Especially (unfortunately) the mozzies. \n\nThe Grampians are full of\
  \ them and, as I hobble out of the tent, I am full of the Grampians. I\u2019ll take\
  \ the formidable evening mosquito clouds for these Paleozoic mountains.\n\nMy boyfriend\
  \ is off filtering water. Unlike me, he\u2019s good at things like that. Lugging\
  \ a heavy pack down kilometres of unchanging jungle, cooking. I wish I was more\
  \ like him. Sometimes I wonder whether the love that hit me like a Boeing 737 wasn\u2019\
  t simple envy\u2014 of his efficiency, his drive to do something important, his\
  \ uncomplicated outlook on life.\n\nAs I return to the tent, I spot a magpie feather,\
  \ a breathtaking apparition. After getting lost in the woods, when we get phone\
  \ service again, I\u2019ll google \u2018magpie symbolism\u2019. For now, it feels\
  \ like an omen of a good thing. \n\nDay 22\n\nBought a book today. Swing Time, Zadie\
  \ Smith. The plot\u2019s already sprouting inside my head like a field of sunflowers.\
  \ As yellow as the paper cover.\n\nThe bookstore? Lost on an Australian outback\
  \ road, a detour caused by the summer bushfires. There was feminist erotica in the\
  \ basement.\n\nAs we speed away, I\u2019m sure that town did not exist. I\u2019\
  ll never remember its name.\n\nDay 35\n\nByron was hip, chill, culturally appropriative.\
  \ Being on the road, though, that was the best. I\u2019d be crying and shaking,\
  \ hair matted because showers now meant saltwater\u2014 then, I\u2019d feel it.\n\
  \nGreen. The smell of forest rain, the quiet mumbling of a podcast just out of hearing.\
  \ A trance taking hold as the car races. \n\nA country eternal like Pangea. North\
  \ to south, mountains, farms, and sea.\n\n\nMelbourne\u2019s airport smells nothing\
  \ like the hills of Byron. I no longer have a boyfriend, still don\u2019t have myself.\
  \ But there\u2019s a spot of clarity, Australia\u2019s gift, burning like the red\
  \ earth.\n\nAs much as I resist articulating it, the organs in my belly know it.\
  \ \u2018I will have this again. Lovers\u2019, they murmur, \u2018Openings to love,\
  \ and breakings out of love. Not-knowing-myself and incredible rightness\u2019.\
  \ The plane back to Argentina soared, I closed my eyes again. \n\nBut those deep\
  \ parts of me were already existing somewhere else, somewhere non-linear and more\
  \ permanent. A place of magpie feathers, Berlin grocery stores, and a sunset in\
  \ a convertible, chasing kangaroos in Melbourne\u2019s countryside."
