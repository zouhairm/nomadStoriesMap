Text: "I went to Colombia mostly since I wanted to backpack through South America\
  \ and it seemed like a good country to start with. It has never been a must go to\
  \ place for me but I am beyond happy that I went. Colombia was such a nice surprise,\
  \ the country is filled with colorful towns, exciting activities, tons of hiking\
  \ trails and helpful people. I went to Colombia which no expectations and without\
  \ an itinerary. I ended up staying a bit over a month and visited both the big cities,\
  \ as well as smaller towns in between and the Caribbean coast.\nA place that ended\
  \ up being one of my favorites was Guatap\xE9, which is located about two hours\
  \ from Medellin. Guatap\xE9 is known for the 642 steps up the Pe\xF1ol and most\
  \ backpackers only visit the town over a day. What a mistake according to myself.\
  \ This place was definitely worth visiting for more than just the Pe\xF1ol. The\
  \ city center and all its streets were filled with colorful decorations, cozy caf\xE9\
  es, street food, and boutiques.\nAfter my visit, I found out that Guatap\xE9 is\
  \ actually nationally known as the most colorful place of the country, amongst Colombians.\
  \ The more well-known town of Cartagena is otherwise the city most international\
  \ people talk about when mentioning the colorfulness of Colombia.\nI would recommend\
  \ all upcoming travelers to go beyond the most known places and to give countries,\
  \ such as Colombia, with a bad reputation, a chance. You might just end up being\
  \ blown away!"
