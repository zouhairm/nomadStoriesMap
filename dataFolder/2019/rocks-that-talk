Text: "On August 12th, 1997, a 40-foot-high wall of water swept through lower Antelope\
  \ Canyon in Page, Arizona, killing 11 people hiking through the canyon during a\
  \ flash flood. This was the tour guide\u2019s explanation as to why there were no\
  \ tours during flashflood season. And for this reason, my family chose to tour Antelope\
  \ Canyon on a cold, but sunny winter day. \n\tThe drive started from Las Vegas/\
  \ Paradise, Nevada in a cramped rental mini-van that was supposed to seat eight\
  \ people, but comprised of 10 butts of family members for four hours of complaints,\
  \ pretzel neck positions and penguin-like body heat. \n\tArriving at the canyon,\
  \ I was doubtful the canyon would be worth it. Around me were sprinkles of tourists\
  \ standing on the tan desert floor. A man with long hair tied in a ponytail and\
  \ olive tone skin announced an upcoming performance. The wind blew gusts that moved\
  \ my beanie and the sound of tourists chatter to hushed whispers. This man identified\
  \ as a descendant of the Navajo and a tour guide for the canyon. The canyon began\
  \ to cry a low moan as the wind traveled to it. It was as if the canyon knew we\
  \ were going to disturb its natural peace, walking through it with our carbon footprints.\
  \ \n\tThe start of the tour began with a mile hike on a flat dusty land. My family\
  \ had split up on the basis of who was more physically capable of moving faster.\
  \ I was accompanied by my 20-year-old cousin Rochelle and 19-year-old best friend\
  \ Abby who were equally adventurous as I was. The path left a graveling crunch sound\
  \ as if people were dragging their feet as opposed to walking. I noticed the metal\
  \ railings drilled painfully into the Earth around us the steeper the path got until\
  \ it ended at a bridge to a stairway. I made the mistake of looking down the bridge\
  \ into what looked like over 70 feet of the smooth auburn wave-cut rock. \n\u201C\
  Don\u2019t be scared, cuz,\u201D my cousin told me at the top of the ladder we had\
  \ to climb down.\nNo words scared me more. The thought of falling filled my head,\
  \ I would fall into an abyss where my body would not be found or worse washed away\
  \ in a later flash flood. With shaky legs and a killer grip, I found myself at the\
  \ foot of the canyon in one piece. I never felt so small in the world until that\
  \ moment staring up at the mouth of the canyon. Wind blew, but very lightly. The\
  \ sun hit the rocks in a way that made it seem like the only colors down here were\
  \ shades of orange. For once, I felt grounded, at peace. The canyon did not moan\
  \ as it did when we were on top. The further we walked, the path narrowed. We blindly\
  \ followed the tour guide with full trust we would reach the end. It was like the\
  \ canyon knew its effect on us, on me. I traced my finger tips on the smooth rock\
  \ leaving orange dirt on my palms. Around me, the canyon shared its story through\
  \ its wrinkles, its shape, its paths from all directions known and unknown, kind\
  \ of like life. By the time we got to the other end of the canyon, it was like time\
  \ resumed. I didn\u2019t hear the moan of the canyon. The canyon had shared its\
  \ story and it was my turn to tell others."
