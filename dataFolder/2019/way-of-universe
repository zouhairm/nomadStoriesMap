Text: "Every traveller seems to want to meet new people and experience other cultures\
  \ on their journeys.We all want to connect locally.So One day i go to my relative\
  \ home for spend good time in Aeroplane. I sat with  one lady who dont know me.we\
  \ meet each other and become a good friend. I ask for food to join me . She accept\
  \ my offer and take some French fries from me and give great gesture to me for my\
  \ great kind of heart.So well she tell me about her carrer and his past. She was\
  \ a docter so i gave some tips from her. I loved his voice and his great kind of\
  \ heart. She told  me that she was going in hospital for Futhure job. She me stroies\
  \ of his life and his childhood that was so funny and really funny . So i think\
  \ that this journey is great for me  to travel with a great and funny  person.\n\
  \                     she was gentle and kind; generous and noble; thoughtful and\
  \ considerate; honest and sincere; loyal and trustworthy. She liked the good and\
  \ disliked the evil. She had a sense of humour without excess; she joked but always\
  \ spoke the truth; she was simple but firm; she was humble though he had great wisdom\
  \ and knowledge; she was an example of morality; and she was a mercy to anyone who\
  \ got in touch with him.Another point of this observation is the fact that the Prophet\
  \ was independent, gainfully employed, and very successful. His efficient work performance\
  \ and excellent ability were actually one the main reasons was attracted to her.\
  \ Although she was wealthy and able to support the household.\n               Another\
  \ feature of the relationship between me was her unprecedented loyalty to me. Loyalty\
  \ is actually a cause and a result of the ideal marital relationship which existed\
  \ between them. Loyalty is not just the lack of cheating, or lack of having extra-marital\
  \ relations. Loyalty can be an on-going positive attitude which can be expressed\
  \ in many actions, words or gestures. The resultant strenghthening of personal relations\
  \ between the partners will in turn increase their loyalty towards one another.I\
  \ also had a special kind of feeling towards eachother. Besides respect and affection,\
  \ there was a great communication understanding.\n                    She want to\
  \ make hospital for poor and needy people.I also work work in NGOs to help the poor\
  \ and poeple of God .So we both have strong view to help the other we make mutual\
  \ understanding between the . In this journey , infact i impress from her. And i\
  \ loved his nature and going to spend more time with her but we both reach to station\
  \ .Our journey was going to end and that the moment for very sad for me because\
  \ we both enjoy that time and company with eachother. We share contact with eachother\
  \ and leave the plane and airport.\n       Later on, I miss her very much his voice\
  \ and his joke his way of speak was very gentle. So she call me once time for meet\
  \ with eachother.I take a time for a meeting. She call me for the dinner and i accept\
  \ it. I go there and meet her and take a dinner we both talk about last journey\
  \ that give us more pleasure and affection.After that I proposed her beacause i\
  \ love his company and spend more time with her. I think this is my great life patner\
  \ to help me every part of my life this is also great for her \n             The\
  \ point to be made is that the mutual counseling and support between marriage partners\
  \ is an essential ingredient for a successful family life. It serves two purposes:\
  \ One is that a very useful source of counsel and support must be utilized rather\
  \ than wasted. Second, the consulted partner will develop confidence, in addition\
  \ to a sense of participation and appreciation, which will further strengthen family\
  \ ties.\n              So she accept my proposal but she want to work on his carrer\
  \ So take some time from me for marriege this journey is great for my life that\
  \ because I see the *WAY OF UNIVERSE* who gave me so much releaf and great life\
  \ patner"
