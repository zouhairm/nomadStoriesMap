Text: "All of the tots in the daycare were wearing Carnaval costumes, dressed up as\
  \ superheroes, clowns, and all kinds of animals. A few of the youngest kids threw\
  \ toy trucks at one another, not seeming to grasp the purpose of wheels. Two girls\
  \ in Elsa dresses and one in a Spiderman costume stood on a table, dancing to music\
  \ that was either inaudible to me or nonexistent. One child wearing a dragon onesie\
  \ ran circles around my coworkers, the fabric of her costume sagging and dripping\
  \ a substance I could only hope was water. Two of the oldest boys, who we later\
  \ deemed Mohawk and Minion because of their outfits, could not keep themselves from\
  \ climbing on my colleague, Ari. I watched from the kitchen as he collapsed on the\
  \ couch opposite me under the weight of their wriggling bodies. To my right, three\
  \ boys in clown costumes clamored over one another in the ball pit. Spider-Elsje,\
  \ as Ari called her, paraded across the Kienderbenkske floor in plastic dress-up\
  \ heels and her superhero outfit, head held high. \n I had worked closely with young\
  \ children while teaching preschool in Boston, but didn\u2019t know exactly what\
  \ to expect from the Dutch daycare center when I arrived to support their English\
  \ education program. I asked one of the school\u2019s employees to write out a list\
  \ of classroom rules that I could forward to my volunteers, as we were unsure of\
  \ what the children were and weren\u2019t allowed to do. She sat down on the floor\
  \ next to me, computer in lap, and pulled up a blank Word document. She went to\
  \ type, but paused, finger to her mouth.\n\t\u201CHow do you call the\u2026 wash\
  \ bin?\u201D she inquired. She threw her arm out to stop the dragon child galloping\
  \ by and plopped her on the floor next to me. \u201CWhy her front is all wet.\u201D\
  \n\t\u201COh, the sink?\u201D\n\t\u201CYes, yes, do not allow them to play in the\
  \ sink.\u201D She began typing. The final rule list read:\nNo running,\nNo playing\
  \ with the sink,\nNo playing in the babybox,\nThey can play on the windowsill but\
  \ no jumping off it\n\nWith these rules in mind, I moved to sit with a young boy\
  \ who was coloring in a picture of a bird. He scribbled back and forth with a blue\
  \ crayon, paying no attention to the lines on the page. I pointed at the picture\
  \ and said \u201Cblue.\u201D He stopped coloring mid-stroke and slowly moved his\
  \ gaze upward until he met my eyes. \u201CNee,\u201D he stated disdainfully, \u201C\
  blau.\u201D He returned to his bird, and I sat, a little dumbfounded, wondering\
  \ how to work around his certainty. \n\tThe children began winding down when their\
  \ teachers announced lunchtime. Ari and I sat with Minion while he ate. He appeared\
  \ a bit more cognizant than the rest of the children, listening to everything we\
  \ said to each other whether he understood it or not. He asked if we spoke \u201C\
  Engels,\u201D and when I responded that we did, he stared straight at me and growled\
  \ \u201CI. Am. Speed.\u201D Unsure of how to respond, Ari and I both laughed and\
  \ looked at his teacher. She said he was a big fan of the Disney movie Cars. She\
  \ asked Minion if he knew anything else in English, and he sat for a moment before\
  \ responding, brow furrowed.\n \u201CI love you.\u201D"
