Text: After experiencing an amazing day overlooking the great Lake Malawi, para-gliding
  over its deep and luring blue waters and eating a delicious local lunch at Club
  Makakola, it was time to head back to our lovely beach house. We were not even at
  the car yet, when the we heard a frantic scream behind us. Astonished, we turned
  around and saw the poor waiter, running up to us, obviously trying to get our attention.
  We stopped, thinking frantically - we got the kids, we paid the bill. What could
  possibly be wrong? When the black waiter reached us, we were astonished to see two
  things in his hands. A rugby ball and a wallet. Both have been carelessly left behind
  by us on our way out. We could not believe our eyes. Not only did we just enjoyed
  a marvelous day out that we won't ever forget. We just got back what we never even
  knew we had lost. In perfect condition. Needless to say, we gave the man a reward,
  which he at first did not want to take. When we asked why?, he just replied, in
  our country it is the right thing to do. Being a citizen of another African country,
  we could not believe our ears. It just show you, that even in one of the most beautifull
  parts of Africa, honesty and integrity can still be found among common people.
