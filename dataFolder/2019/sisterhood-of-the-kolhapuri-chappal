Text: "My attention was captured by the Kolhapuri Chappal (Footwear) of my seatmate\
  \ in a plane from Frankfurt to Amsterdam. My eyes traveled from her feet to her\
  \ face and a nice surprise was waiting for me. She was a middle age European woman\
  \ with a subtle smile on her face. \n\nI, a girl from Pakistan, was on my way to\
  \ Amsterdam via Doha and Frankfurt. I got a Fellowship and was going to Netherlands\
  \ on a short course.\n\nI started my journey from Peshawar airport and reached Frankfurt\
  \ where an airport official was waiting for me with a placard displayed my name.\
  \ He approached me and informed that my flight to Amsterdam has been delayed for\
  \ 2 hours. He guided me towards the gate and arranged a new boarding pass.\n\nI\
  \ boarded the flight and sat on my seat. I wanted to be alone. However after a while\
  \ the seat was occupied by a woman. I could not see her face at first because my\
  \ attention was captured by her footwear.\n\n\u201CHi, I am Jennifer\u201D, said\
  \ the woman. She had a pretty smile on her face. She was a tall woman with lean\
  \ figure, golden long hair, and colored eyes, dressed in a polka dot shirt, blue\
  \ jeans and black coat. Indeed, she had a pleasant personality.\n\nI introduced\
  \ myself but my mind was still stuck with her kolhapuri chappal. Kolhapuri Chappals\
  \ are famous handcrafted footwear made in Kolhapur, in Maharashtra a state of India\
  \ and are equally popular and used in Pakistan. It is made from processed leather.\n\
  \n\u201CThe weather is pleasant outside in Frankfurt\u201D, she said. \u201CWell\
  \ I hope it will be the same in Amsterdam\u201D, she continued after a pause.\n\n\
  I looked at her and smiled: Is this your pleasure trip to Amsterdam?\u201D I asked\
  \ with sheer interest.\n\n\u201CWell I am going home, my three kids and my husband\
  \ are waiting for me\u201D, she responded pleasantly. \u201CI was in Frankfurt for\
  \ a short term consultancy\u201D, she added. Then she told me that she is a freelancer\
  \ consultant.\n\nMy interest was now developed and I was interested to know more\
  \ about her and, of course, about the background of wearing a Kolhapuri.\n\n\u201C\
  I was in Pakistan twice in my life and look at my shoes, I bought them in Karachi\u201D\
  , she said.\n\n\u201CReally\u201D! I asked with excitement. Now, she was not a stranger\
  \ for me, a sense of deep joy was flowing within me, the joy of finding a friend\
  \ in a strange woman who once lived in my country! Now, the scenario had completely\
  \ changed. I was overwhelmed and I wanted to know more about her.\n\nThe acquaintance\
  \ with her continued for another one hour and then we reached Schipol airport, Amsterdam.\
  \ Now, another challenge was waiting for me. I had never been in Europe and I did\
  \ not have knowledge of transportation, ticketing and other basic things. After\
  \ taking control of my luggage, I turned and found Jenifer in front of me. She smiled\
  \ and asked if I wanted to go somewhere she could guide me.\n\nAt that very moment,\
  \ I needed the help she was offering. She took me to the ticket machine and oriented\
  \ me how to use. It was not the end; she accompanied me to the platform and taught\
  \ me how the underground train system worked.\n\nWhen we were departing, I hugged\
  \ her tightly. A hug, which was reflecting my gratitude for her help and for the\
  \ bond which was unspoken. She smiled and turned back as her husband was waiting\
  \ outside to pick her. My eyes followed the golden stripe of her Kolhapuri until\
  \ she disappeared from my sight.\n\nThis incident was a great asset of my journey;\
  \ we bonded in a universal sisterhood. My brief rendezvous with Jennifer helped\
  \ me a lot during my stay in Europe. It taught me that we human are connected in\
  \ one way or the other and we are in this world to support one another.\n\nSomewhere\
  \ there is a Kolhapuri Chappal between every human being which connect them irrespective\
  \ of color, race, religion, and nationality. We just need to discover our very own\
  \ Kolhapuri for harmony, peace, and love in the world."
