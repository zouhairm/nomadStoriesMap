Text: "Syed Muhammad Ali Azher after completing his bachelor's developed an interest\
  \ in various research subjects and as of now, he is doing Masters. During his first\
  \ year in Germany, Ali learned a lot from this country because the education system,\
  \ lifestyle, people, language, culture e.t.c everything is different from his country\
  \ and was new for him. But after some time, Ali felt the change and that change\
  \ was inevitable. He volunteered two times one for the Kinder-Uni as a supervisor\
  \ where he learned how to organize and supervise kids from different schools. How\
  \ to ensure learning with fun. After a few months he volunteered again for the International\
  \ Student Week in Ilmenau - (ISWI 2017), he was the Group Leader of the \"lessons\
  \ from the past\" team during that period he met many new people from all over the\
  \ world which results in his personal growth and a better understanding that leads\
  \ to change the future, it is about giving meaning to something. And if you talk\
  \ about work-life today ironically it requires a completed personality you are actually\
  \ supposed to behave a different way at work then you are at home you are supposed\
  \ to take on some kind of professional persona and actually Ali think this probably\
  \ is what causes the most stress symptoms of today that constant pressure trying\
  \ to be somebody else that is not even a human being but a machine. As they say,\
  \ boxes are for dead people. Trust people instead of titles. That is why Ali choose\
  \ to volunteer because he wants to be a flock because he doesn\u2019t really have\
  \ to know exactly where he is going if he can be really confident about that it\u2019\
  s going to be great. It\u2019s easy for anyone who tries.\n\nIf you give respect\
  \ and love to people, they are ready to give it back, even though they are suffering\
  \ but they are ready to help and respect. My aim is to help each other to understand\
  \ the basic principle that we all are the same in this world regardless of our gender,\
  \ race, and color. I decided to express my love to all those who treated me with\
  \ such love and respect whether the organizing committee or the people from the\
  \ city. I thanked everyone to the point of promoting Egypt through my video in an\
  \ innovative way that goes viral in Egypt overnight. My point is we usually show\
  \ the end result of something and we forget about the people who were in the process\
  \ and they are not getting appreciated by us. Imagine one night you made a travel\
  \ video without expecting much from the world and slept after uploading it. In the\
  \ morning you wake up with 2000+ views plus journalists and your friend's messages,\
  \ suddenly everybody wants to know about your journey. Experiencing that time of\
  \ my life was an achievement and uplifting for me that I'll always be proud of.\
  \ I would love to travel the world and visit all the historic places and make videos\
  \ for the people around the world. Because all the answers that we are looking for\
  \ are in the history books.\n\nI have applied for SDG Action award here's is the\
  \ link:\_https://sdgactionawards.org/initiative/1275\n\nI have\_applied to become\
  \ a Young Global Changer,\_this year more than 3.400 people from 155 different countries\
  \ to attend the Global Solutions Summit as well as the YGC Summer School in Berlin\
  \ \u2013 on a full scholarship. My application was among the best they received.\
  \ That is why - even though they said they will not be able to offer me a full scholarship\
  \ - They would still like to invite me to attend this year\u2019s Global Solutions\
  \ Summit from March 18-19, in Berlin - free of charge. \n\nHiding it for years,\
  \ My dream about making a documentary could be achieved through your little appreciation.\
  \ Your help would be used in to buy equipment to really harness\_their\_power and\
  \ take even\_better\_shots. At times like these, the need for your love is greater\
  \ than ever. My goal is to reduce the noise in your life."
