Text: "Sometimes life appears obviously linear, things falling into place one right\
  \ after the other. At other times it\u2019s a strobe of optical wonder, not knowing\
  \ exactly how, when or if the pieces will fall into place. Traveling solo in Bangkok.\n\
  \nI was due to arrive at the Bangkok train station before 10pm. The plan was to\
  \ take a 14 hr sleeper train to Chiang Mai, a mountainous area in Northern Thailand.\
  \  It wasn\u2019t so much of a plan, really more of an idea, as I had no ticket,\
  \ no guidebook and really no idea of how this would all play out.   \n\nThe cabbie\
  \ dropped me off just around the corner, fingers crossed, from the station. As I\
  \ walked around front, I was greeted by several desperate cabbie drivers, a few\
  \ half-naked homeless and several heavily chained doors. Shit. Is the station\u2026\
  \ closed? In the instance of a breath, two fast paced backpackers started to pass\
  \ me. I cannot lose this opportunity.  \"How do you get into the station?\u201D\
  \  I hollered.  \"Through this KFC,\" they replied. I followed in line behind them.\
  \  Around the bend and through the hall, we were in\u2026 into the abysmal doom\
  \ of sweat and smell that is the Bangkok train station.   \n\nLuckily, at this point\
  \ I have a half hour to spare. I maneuver through numerous families sprawled out\
  \ on the floor, dodge a few cats and head to the sales window. \"One sleeper ticket\
  \ to Chiang Mai,\" I say confidently.  Oh, no sleeper, only seat, you want? By the\
  \ looks of this station, a seat is arbitrary. So there I stand, bags in hand, far\
  \ from home, a 14hr train ride in a \u2018seat\u2019 and no where else to go.  Yes,\
  \ ok, I say reluctantly.  After the purchase of a ticket, I go outside to mentally\
  \ prepare. The sites that surround me are not encouraging.\n\nWith ten minutes,\
  \ and a quick, very unpleasant trip to the squat toilet, I move over to the railway.\
  \ When I arrive, I peak inside. It is grim, packed & smells of god only knows what.\
  \ I go back outside the train. Can I do this?  I ponder.  I start to stress; knowing\
  \ I have about three minutes to make a decision; knowing that I\u2019ve taken a\
  \ sleeper train in Europe that wasn\u2019t half this bad and had a panic attack\
  \ within the first half hour; knowing that I got major vertigo after 4hrs of sightseeing;\
  \ knowing that I could do this, but the question is do I want to? Hell No.\n\nAs\
  \ I rush outside, I am accosted by cabbies. Where you go?  Airport?  Hotel? I drive\
  \ you. Grabbing at my luggage, pushing at me, I try to remain sane.  I am hot as\
  \ hell, sweating profusely, completely lost and about to lose it.  For about the\
  \ hundredth time, he asks, where you go? With fire in my eyes, I look at him, point\
  \ behind him and say, YOU GO THERE.  I held that gaze until he retreated and gave\
  \ myself a minute to think. What do to, what to do?\n\nIt is then I spot the two\
  \ Europeans girls I saw earlier, their guidebook is in German. Damn high school\
  \ French, still of no help in this lifetime! They tell me the name one hostel. \
  \ In look beyond the chaos to find a young cabbie smiling in the distance. I call\
  \ him over. He knows the hostel. He speaks better then average English. I point\
  \ to the map, you take me here? Yes, he replies. And off I go\u2026 again.\n\nHis\
  \ name is Big (although he is quite small).  I told him I picked him because of\
  \ his smile.  He replies, every minute I smile, a minute longer I live. I like that.\
  \  After much chatting across town, he drops me off at Lumpur House, I walk up and\
  \ ask if there is any availability.  There is ONE room left and I take it.  AHHHH.\
  \   \n\nTonight I sleep in an actual bed and an actual pillow.  I take nothing for\
  \ granted.\n\nTomorrow I book a flight to Chiang Mai."
