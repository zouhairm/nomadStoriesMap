Text: "I had met a professional photographer who had asked me to accompany him to\
  \ the forbidden territory of West Bengal, to document his work.\nI wasn\u2019t ready.\
  \ I waited to finish my studies before I decided to go on my own. India was meant\
  \ to be the ultimate test. If I could thrive there, I would be ready to tackle the\
  \ rest of the world. Was I carved from the same wood great reporters were made of?\n\
  I had read so many books about the country, from travel memoirs to masterful novels,\
  \ that I felt nothing would surprise me. I was well prepared.\n\t\n\tYet, as soon\
  \ as the plane landed in Thiruvananthapuram and its door opened onto the smothering\
  \ night, I was in for a shock. No one had told me about the putrid smell of decaying\
  \ rats. The smell was always just mentioned in passing and not with that much precision.\
  \ But the smell didn't pass. It clung to the air, as if forming an inner layer in\
  \ my lungs. \n\tIt didn't pass after I was ushered out of the shack called the international\
  \ airport, nor did it once I fought my way through the swarm of handsy rickshaw\
  \ and taxi drivers that welcomed me and the rest of the passengers outside. \n\t\
  It didn't pass as my taxi sped into the narrow, pot-holed road bordered by thin\
  \ human shadows on their way to what seemed like mysterious places, an army of ghosts\
  \ the taxi often brushed against and that miraculously survived, as I did against\
  \ all odds, the reckless drive to the city. \n\tIt didn't pass when the taxi dumped\
  \ me in the dark alley my hostel was unwisely located in and where my room had a\
  \ view of a dome of trash slowly burning underneath my window. It didn't pass after\
  \ a cold shower, nor the short, nauseating sleep that followed, nor did it after\
  \ I escaped to the seashore the next day, my stomach in a shambles, my hopes of\
  \ being an explorer shattered by the lack of adaptation my body and mind displayed\
  \ and I wondered why, out of all the places in the world, I had chosen this country\
  \ to start my journey around the world.\n\n\tYet, what no one had told me was that\
  \ I will come to miss this very smell, that it will somehow disappear without notice,\
  \ never to come back, no matter how many times I would fly in and out of the subcontinent,\
  \ as though the day I landed a rat the size of the city had died and been laid on\
  \ a thick, invisible cloud above me, where it would rot while following me around\
  \ until I learned to relax, until I learned to accept the colourfully idiosyncratic\
  \ world I live in without comparing it to the one I came from.\n\tI still wonder\
  \ if this smell had been a powerful figment of my terrified imagination or a trick\
  \ the local gods had set in motion to prepare me for what was to come in the nine\
  \ months I would spend there."
