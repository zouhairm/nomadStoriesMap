Text: "I leapt, from the icy Berlin winter into the suffocating heat of Brazil, pulsing\
  \ with the Carnival craze. I was both scared to death and excited AF. I didn't know\
  \ what to expect from this week. What was I thinking, flying across the world for\
  \ a man I barely knew? My friends warned me about the dangers of Brazil (\u201C\
  You'll have your throat sliced in two\u201D) and of Brazilian men (\u201CYou'll\
  \ have your heart sliced in two\u201D). I had met Bruno back in Berlin. Five nights\
  \ of forgetting the world in each others' bodies. Before leaving, he had given me\
  \ one of his deep dark gazes and challenged me: \u201CCome to visit me in Brazil.\u201D\
  \n\nSo there I was at Sao Paulo airport, following my crazy goddam heart. As I stepped\
  \ into his car, I didn't know whether the feeling in my stomach was fear or arousal.\
  \ Probably both. The night was falling, we were speeding through the city on a five\
  \ way road across the concrete forest, swallowed in its dark moist heat. At every\
  \ red light, he would close the windows and lock the doors. \u201CFor safety\u201D\
  \ he said. I saw a young beggar who had lost his legs moving between the cars on\
  \ a skateboard.\n\nBruno's building had security guards. He said that this was normal\
  \ in Brazil. Later on I couldn't help but be suspicious: Why was his apartment so\
  \ clean? Was he married? Was this the flat where he would bring all his lovers?\
  \ To slice their heart in two...or their throat? Then, in a bright Brazilian smile,\
  \ he hold my whole body to kiss me and just like that, all doubts melt away.\n\n\
  The next few days, I was in heaven. We would go to fancy bars, all located in concrete\
  \ cubes, and stroll through parks full of tropical plants, that I had only known\
  \ from greenhouses. But fear crawled back in when he left for work on Wednesday.\
  \ Without his protective presence, the outside seemed like a hostile world. It wasn't\
  \ until Friday that I gathered the courage to go out of the building by myself.\
  \ \n\nI decided to walk towards the Museum of Modern Art and before I knew it, I\
  \ was lost. I tried to relax and text him. No more battery. I stepped into a random\
  \ bus and hoped to recognize something at some point. After 20 minutes, the only\
  \ thing I recognized, was that the bus was driving away from the City Center straight\
  \ to THE FAVELAS, City of Sin. It was starting to get dark, I stepped out at the\
  \ next station, in panic, trying to communicate with pedestrians through gestures,\
  \ as no one could speak English. The tropical rain started pouring and I hid in\
  \ a corner of the bus station. My friends were right. I was going to disappear into\
  \ Sao Paulo's night. But when I looked up, I noticed that everyone else was relaxed\
  \ and happy, on their way out for a drink. I was actually near Para\xEDso, a train\
  \ station I knew. I ran home, shivering like after near-death experience. And yet,\
  \ during all that time, I had just been near Paradise.\n\nOn the weekend, we went\
  \ for a trip to Rio. There, Carnival was celebrated to its fullest. It was an explosion\
  \ of colors and joy. Women and men in all shapes and sizes were proudly showing\
  \ off their bodies in pink, yellow, green, zebra patterned T-shirts, dresses and\
  \ bikinis. In the Portuguese colonial  architecture streets, huge trees were growing\
  \ wildly, devouring the whole space. Here, even nature disregarded rules. Everywhere\
  \ in the metro, there were ads with condoms raining on a crowd of dancing people.\
  \ The world had just gone mad. \n\nIn the evening, Bruno brought me to his favorite\
  \ bar, Boteco Cabidinho. It was midnight, full and loud. In the background, a TV\
  \ was showing the parade crumbling down. We were drinking and talking for hours.\
  \ In between two shots of cacha\xE7a, he dived into my eyes and said:\n\u201CThere's\
  \ this energy between us, I can feel it. I'm serious about us.\u201D Yes, it was\
  \ scary, but so worth it. And just like that, my heart leapt."
