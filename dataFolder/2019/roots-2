Text: "One of the most valuable skills a person can possess, for me, will always be\
  \ the ability to rediscover and rejoice with what is already known to them. If I\
  \ close my eyes now, sitting in front of this computer writing this text, and think\
  \ about my favorite place in the whole world the answer will come automatically\
  \ to me. If you asked me, I would answer without hesitation: Silveira Beach, Garopaba.\
  \ In Santa Catarina, Brazil.\n\nWhile different neurological stimuli worked for\
  \ these words to leave my mouth to give you a satisfactory answer, my body would\
  \ be plagued by different memories intertwined with the sensory experiences rooted\
  \ in my subconscious. As the words left my lips, I would be feeling the wind on\
  \ my skin, always soft, always fresh, fed by the green (so green) mountains that\
  \ surround the beach. I would be feeling the sand on my feet, so characteristic\
  \ of that place. A damp, coarse sand that sticks to our skin, multicolored due to\
  \ the different pebbles that are there. I would also remember how difficult it is\
  \ to walk on Silveira Beach, because of this thick, soft sand, making each step\
  \ carry the effort of five other steps. \n\nA reminder to travelers: Praia do Silveira\
  \ is not a place for morning walks. It is a place for contemplation.\n\nIt is easy\
  \ to get lost just admiring the sea on the beach. Not that it is not in other beaches,\
  \ but there, in Silveira Beach the sea is the blueest that can be. It is also powerful,\
  \ with strong waves that attract a few surfers, but at the same time gentle enough\
  \ to create perfect natural pools for a sea bath, near its mountains. Which leaves\
  \ everything very interesting and reveals a pleasant contrast of this place, because\
  \ the green mountains that create a gentle wind also serve as pasture for cows and\
  \ horses that live there, running by the sea. \n\nAs automatic as this response\
  \ ever was, it was not until a short time ago that I understood the reason for my\
  \ total fascination for this place. Unlike any other person who may come to visit\
  \ Silveira Beach and create their own valuable memories, I will carry a souvenir\
  \ that no travel package can buy: the feeling of home. Because together with all\
  \ my memories, the most important thing for me is perhaps the voice of my grandmother,\
  \ calling my name across the beach to let me know that lunch is ready, a meal she\
  \ probably fished herself. She, like all the simple people who live there, is the\
  \ essence of that place.\n\nIt was just coming back to my grandmother's house as\
  \ an adult woman that I understood that. It was then that I rediscovered this place,\
  \ absolutely fascinated by its natural beauties, but realizing that no matter how\
  \ many other beaches I meet in life, this will be the only one for which I can always\
  \ return, because there it's more than my favorite place in the whole world, it\
  \ is my home."
