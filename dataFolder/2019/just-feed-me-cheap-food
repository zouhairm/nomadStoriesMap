Text: "I picked Chiang Mai because it was the cheapest city in South East Asia. I\
  \ had just finished Japan with the family and had another trip to Korea lined up\
  \ with university friends, but that was in another month. So I just needed somewhere\
  \ close and most importantly cheap to hole up in the meantime. A quick search online\
  \ directed me towards Chiang Mai, a somewhat rural city in the far north of Thailand\
  \ known for its elephant sanctuaries and nature hikes. But to me, it was a city\
  \ of $1 meals and an escape from all the noise of the modern world, the perfect\
  \ place to recollect my thoughts and \"find myself\".  What I did not expect was\
  \ to miss my flight, be almost set on fire and experience one of the most magical\
  \ spectacles of my life. \n\nDuring my month there, I didn't get up to much being\
  \ on a tight budget. I enjoyed cheap food, basked in the trying Chiang Mai heat\
  \ and often visited shopping malls for that temporary escape to cool crisp air and\
  \ that touch of comfortable modernization. However, I did manage to meet a handful\
  \ of locals. They were warm, hospitable and very friendly. They took me to the mountains\
  \ and taught me how to say a few basic phrases, my favorite was \"aroy\" which translates\
  \ to delicious. It was pretty much what I envisioned my relaxing Chiang Mai trip\
  \ to be. Steady heartbeats and uneventful.\n\nThere was one thing that irked me.\
  \ At some point during every conversation with a local the question \"when are you\
  \ leaving Chiang Mai?\" would pop up. My answer was always the same since I had\
  \ already booked my flight \"19th November!\" but like clockwork, their response\
  \ was also always the same \"you're going to miss Yi Peng! it's on the 20th November\"\
  . After hearing the exact dialogue one too many times I went to Google to find what\
  \ the fuss was all about. It turns out it was a smaller festival within another\
  \ festival (Loy Krathong) that was uniquely celebrated within Chiang Mai and I was\
  \ tragically booked to leave the morning before it begins. I was truly torn, I did\
  \ want to see this festival and celebrate it with all my new friends but I also\
  \ didn't want to fork out another $400 for a new flight. \n\nBefore long it was\
  \ the night of the 18th. As I lay in bed I came to an epiphany; what the hell, when\
  \ is the next time I'll be back in this city again? This is something I\"ll probably\
  \ forget later down the road and with that I went to sleep without setting an alarm\
  \ for my 8am flight the next morning. \n\nThe 19th was a sunny day, like almost\
  \ every other day I spent in Chiang Mai. I contacted my very confused friends that\
  \ day alerting them about my abrupt itinerary change. We made plans to eat at a\
  \ riverside restaurant for the first night of the Yee Peng.\n\nCome 20th evening\
  \ and as we make our way out on to the street we find them jammed packed with people\
  \ dancing, people carrying lanterns and a general air of anticipation. I was excited\
  \ and a little bit cynical as I wondered if this festival was really worth that\
  \ $400. We ended up in a riverside restaurant but couldn't see much of the sky from\
  \ our table since we didn't end up making a booking but there was a courtyard outside\
  \ and a pier into the river which was easily accessible. I remember halfway through\
  \ our meal somebody said \"I think it's begun\", I looked to the courtyard and they\
  \ were all staring at the sky. \"Oh man this is it,\" I thought to myself as I briskly\
  \ ran outside and followed everyone's gaze. It was absolutely beautiful. The dark\
  \ blue blue sky was lit with hundreds of small flickering lanterns. It's difficult\
  \ to describe something so cinematic with mere words. I remember standing there\
  \ transfixed and feeling as if I had just received my invitation letter to Hogwarts.\
  \ It was truly a magical experience, was it worth the $400? well, you'll probably\
  \ have to see for yourself."
