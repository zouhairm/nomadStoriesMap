Text: "My Mother used to say \u201Cif you\u2019re on time, you\u2019re late\u201D\
  , so I made sure I stepped inside the coffee shop fifteen minutes before our scheduled\
  \ meeting. I chose the coziest seats and started sipping on my favorite drink (a\
  \ hot dawa made of ginger, lemon and honey) when Ms LeToya called. She was running\
  \ late. I decided to indulge on a coconut bar while scrolling through Instagram,\
  \ the same way I had actually found her. \n\nAbout 40 minutes into my wait, a loud\
  \ and melodic voice which had the sound of a mixture of British and Kenyan chanted\
  \ in the quiet coffee shop: \u201CHello darling, so sorry I\u2019m late.\u201D \
  \ I turned around to discover a tall, elegant and graceful transgender woman.  Hair\
  \ and nails fresh out of a state-of-the-art beauty salon, designer handbag and clothes,\
  \ she was runway ready.  I immediately complimented her on her beautiful handbag.\
  \  She retorted, \u201CI know right! Everyone loves my bags. This one is from a\
  \ street market, one of my secret shopping spots, I always manage to find expensive\
  \ pieces there which the seller has no clue are designer.\u201D I knew right then\
  \ and there she was my type of girl.  I\u2019m also a thrift shopper and love a\
  \ good bargain.  \n\nShe sat down and I then proceeded to ask all about her life\
  \ as a transgender woman in Kenya and how she became a fashion stylist. An outspoken\
  \ transgender woman in a country that does not recognize but prohibits and severely\
  \ punishes same sex relationships and intercourse? I was intrigued to say the least.\
  \ LeToya was anything but shy about the topic, she was bold and fiercely living\
  \ her life out loud.  \n\nShe went on to tell me how she became who she is today,\
  \ and I was on the edge of my seat for the entire conversation. As a child, she\
  \ was left with relatives while her parents had gone to the United States to build\
  \ a new life away from Kenya. She was meant to join them as soon as they would be\
  \ settled in, when they tragically died in a car accident. The terrible event left\
  \ her wandering from house to house in hopes that someone would finally take her\
  \ in. When someone finally did, she was forced into working for them as a housemaid.\n\
  \nLeToya did not let this stop her from her dreams of getting an education.  She\
  \ would clean all night so that, during the day, she could sneak out while the family\
  \ was at work, to attend school with the rest of the children.  She carried on until\
  \ she was old enough to leave. She knew she wasn\u2019t meant to live in a village,\
  \ so she decided to move to the big city of Nairobi with no money, no friends, and\
  \ even less chances of surviving.  \n\nKibera is the largest slum in Nairobi, and\
  \ it was where LeToya would find shelter for the coming years, struggling to make\
  \ it in the capital. \n\nShe had always known she was different, but now she was\
  \ ready to live life her way, on her own terms. She refused to hide who she really\
  \ was from the world.  Awful events tried to bring her down, but even after being\
  \ brutally raped, she kept her head high and decided to tell her story from the\
  \ mountaintops.  \n\nAlong the way, she fell in love with fashion. She would spend\
  \ her hard earned money buying second hand pieces she would find at markets and\
  \ dress her friends. Slowly, LeToya, the fashion stylist was born.  Her reputation\
  \ preceded her, and people would soon pay her to style them.  When, finally, the\
  \ Kenyan media heard about her, she was able to tell her story of being a transgendered\
  \ woman in the fashion industry in Kenya on a larger platform.  \n\nToday, she has\
  \ over 12,000 followers on Instagram, runs a modeling agency teaching girls how\
  \ to rip the runway, and she styles some of the top personalities in Kenya.  She\
  \ certainly has come a long way, but if there is one lesson Ms LeToya Johnstone\
  \ has learned over the years, it is that amazing outcomes happen to those who stay\
  \ true to themselves."
