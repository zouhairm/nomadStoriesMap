Text: "We exited out long grass heaven. Settling down where the grass was shorter\
  \ and safer to pull out a much needed drink as we watched the trickle that is now\
  \ the drought stricken Crocodile River. \n\nAfter lots of chatting and laughter\
  \ we headed off to have sun downers at one of the benches along the Crocodile River.\
  \ We arrived to find a game vehicle and spotted two foreign tourists some way down\
  \ the side of the fence. There was a huge herd of Elephant right by the fence and\
  \ so we made our way toward them to get some photos.\n\nMy sister and I were walking\
  \ quite happily chatting away. We greeted the two tourists as they passed us. They\
  \ were oblivious to what I was about to see. There are many hazardous creatures\
  \ in the African bush and our eyes and ears are well trained. I never look before\
  \ I step, because you never know what you will step on. We passed the tourists and\
  \ carried on with our walk, feeling somewhat protected by the fence line that separated\
  \ us from the Kruger National Park and all it's wild animals. I looked down and\
  \ saw something in the sand, a rather large and very fresh lion spoor (lion footprint).\
  \ At first I though it's couldn't possibly be. There are no lion in Marloth Park.\
  \ Marloth Park is residential. We do not have big cats. Oh boy was I so very wrong.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019m no game ranger but I know lion footprint when I see one. I wanted\
  \ to confirm first before alerting the others. We followed the spoor for a while\
  \ to make sure we weren't seeing things. It was definitely real, and very fresh.\
  \ It was time, I knew calling the others over would cause panic but they had to\
  \ know. Luckily there was a game ranger close by who confirmed that it was lion\
  \ spoor and that a lion had come under the fence very recently.\n\nIn my opinion\
  \ the foreign tourists had not been eaten and so we had nothing to worry about.\
  \ My mom on the other hand felt quite differently. According to her we were going\
  \ to get eaten at any moment. Mom's will be moms and we love them for it. \n\nDespite\
  \ our disagreement on \u201Cto get eaten or not to get eaten\u201D we continued\
  \ walking while following the lion spoor all the way to where the herd of elephants\
  \ were grazing by the fence. We got our elephant photos and then rather hurriedly\
  \ made our way back to the van.\n\nThe next day it was reported that there were\
  \ lion in the park and that walking and cycling was not advised until the lion were\
  \ darted and returned to  the Kruger National Park. \n\nMarloth Park, although residential,\
  \ is the wildest place where humans live among wild animals in absolute harmony.\
  \ The fence that separates Marloth Park from the Kruger Park as in very bad shape.\
  \ There are some holes in the fence big enough to allow an elephant through. Cats\
  \ are harder to contains and so we always look up at night before heading out to\
  \ make our fire and cook. After all Leopard are stealthy creatures and hard to spot."
