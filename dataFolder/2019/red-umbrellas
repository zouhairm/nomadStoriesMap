Text: "Along the South Bank of the River Thames, the grey water in early November\
  \ reflects that of London.  I wander the path and approach the renowned wheel. The\
  \ Eye slowly creaks and turns, allowing its riders a unique perspective of the old\
  \ city. A blur of red catches my eye near the mechanical ride in a nearby open grass\
  \ area. I walk closer, letting my curiosity guide me, to find a group of people\
  \ gathered. Each one of them is holding a bright red umbrella, fully extended. A\
  \ white letter is painted on each individual rain barrier as a bouquet of red roses\
  \ is planted at the feet of the gathering: \u201CWILL YOU MARRY ME\u201D.\n\tI have\
  \ stumbled upon a surprise engagement! I slowly make my way closer to the scene,\
  \ wanting to be part of this magical moment in the unknown couples\u2019 start of\
  \ their new adventure together in life. I casually take pictures to capture the\
  \ scene. I notice a man heading towards the umbrella bearers and he says, \u201C\
  She said, \u2018Yes\u2019! They\u2019ll be coming down from the Eye any moment now\u201D\
  . \n\tI wonder if I should stay?\u2026 Will they mind a stranger joining in their\
  \ festivities?\u2026. I approach the tall, white, middle-aged man who made the announcement\
  \ and ask him, \u201CAm I intruding on this romantic moment?\u201D \n\t\u201CNo!\u201D\
  \ he responds, \u201CPlease stay and join us. The newly engaged will be here shortly\u201D\
  . I wait with them, while the umbrellas have been placed on the ground, the flowers\
  \ ready to be handed to the mysterious fiancee, and await the couple. A woman with\
  \ long blonde hair is beaming and radiant as she is accompanied by a tall, skinny,\
  \ short blonde-haired man who looks at her with such adoration that he cannot keep\
  \ his eyes off of her; the couple has arrived. The woman is handed the bouquet as\
  \ the man is carrying a drawn picture of their proposal inside the pod of the Eye.\
  \  \n\tI chat with the happy couple, congratulating them on their engagement and\
  \ wishing them a happy life together. They welcome me to take pictures, even though\
  \ there is a photographer already there on the scene. They kiss, they hold each\
  \ other, and they talk and laugh while we photographers capture the moments they\
  \ are sharing together.  \n\tThe surprise has come to an end. For the last time,\
  \ I thank them and congratulate them then depart my separate way back along the\
  \ Thames River path. This magical event happened during my first day in London.\
  \ I never would have expected to come across a surprise engagement but I am reminded\
  \ that Love is all around, in plain sight and even behind closed doors."
