Text: "Climbing awkwardly out of my hammock, I headed in the vague direction of our\
  \ dug out-toilet. Within five steps, I\u2019d realised my mistake. \n\nBorneo is\
  \ home to a dizzying variety of wildlife and natural wonders. I was somewhere in\
  \ the middle of Sabah, one of the islands\u2019 Malaysian states, perhaps best known\
  \ for its tallest mountain, Mount Kinabalu. The towering canopy blocked out any\
  \ snatches of star light. A chorus of insects and unknown animals rushed through\
  \ the trees. Rain was on the way; the air was humid, so dense with moisture it became\
  \ difficult to distinguish between my sweat and the forests\u2019. It made my already\
  \ frizzy hair wild. \n\nBefore venturing onto the sixteen-hour flight, my travel\
  \ experiences had been relatively tame. I\u2019d visited the occasional European\
  \ city, completing a whistle-stop tour of the various landmarks whilst under the\
  \ careful and comforting supervision of family. But something had been missing.\n\
  \nIt was the need to experience true adventure that had led me to this moment. The\
  \ third night of my five-day jungle trek. A further forty-eight hours of restless\
  \ sleep, tinned tuna rations and challenging ascents over rock faces and sprawling\
  \ tree roots beckoned. It was pitch black. The darkness so thick even my expensive\
  \ head torch couldn\u2019t cut through it. Snores from my companions were the only\
  \ indications of familiar life. And I needed to pee. \n\nStanding with one hand\
  \ wrapped around the rope of my hammock, echoes of my guides warnings of jungle\
  \ spirits ran through my head. I had no hope of finding the toilet and making it\
  \ back safely. I had a bad enough sense of direction in my home city. I expected\
  \ to feel terrified. Instead, I was elated.\n\LMurmuring a word of apology to the\
  \ jungle and desperately hoping I wasn\u2019t about to get stung by fire ants, I\
  \ decided to just pee where I was. \n\nWith my bladder taken care of, I perched\
  \ on the edge of my hammock. Aches in my legs and back demanded sleep but my mind\
  \ was alive. Clicking off the light of my torch, I sat bathed in the total darkness,\
  \ my lack of sight heightening my other senses. A hoarse bark travelled through\
  \ the trees, perhaps belonging to the orangutans Borneo is famous for. \n\nThis\
  \ is what it means to travel, I thought. A total submission to your surroundings.\
  \ The courage to trust that, for a while at least, the country, city or rain forest\
  \ you find yourself in will accept you as part of the background, as one of its\
  \ own. To truly experience a country, you must play by its rules. Only then will\
  \ it let you in. \n\nBorneo\u2019s wilderness is what makes it special. Scorpions\
  \ end up curled inside your walking boots. You will fall in love with its jungle\
  \ and cry when you see the mass of palm oil plantations that are replacing it. A\
  \ meandering river cruise can quickly turn into a competition of who can spot the\
  \ most crocodiles. Its\u2019 people are some of the friendliest on Earth. They will\
  \ smile knowingly when you describe your travels, proud to belong to an island that\
  \ is capable of both shocking and delighting any visitor that reaches its' shores.\
  \ \n\nWhen I touched down in Heathrow a week later, it was the moment of trying\
  \ to pee in pitch darkness, with no sight of my surroundings, that stayed with me.\
  \ Since then, no matter where I have travelled\u2013 Europe, or further afield\u2013\
  \ my adventures have been influenced and heightened by the lessons Borneo taught\
  \ me. Sometimes you must drop your pants where you are. It is only by allowing yourself\
  \ to be vulnerable that you can experience the true meaning of travel."
