Text: "Beckoning me with its twinkly lights, the smell of grilled meat wafting from\
  \ the taco stand was the first affirmation I made the right decision.\n\nI landed\
  \ in Mexico City on New Year\u2019s Day, determined the pain and anxiety of the\
  \ last six months was going to be worth it because it all lead to this - whatever\
  \ this was going to end up being. \n\nUnsure of what to expect and filled to the\
  \ brim with hyperbolic fears and warnings of \u201Cbe careful, Mexico is really\
  \ dangerous!\u201D, I waited my turn in immigration, clutching my carryon like it\
  \ was my child. \n\nThe pretty girl at the desk was asking me questions I now can\u2019\
  t remember, when we were both distracted by a little boy driving a very noisy mobile-toy\
  \ car. We looked at each other and smiled, she stamped my passport, handed me my\
  \ immigration slip and off I went to collect my large shiny suitcase. \n\nKindness\
  \ and unspoken moments of human connection have been a theme of my time in Mexico.\
  \ Whether it\u2019s a broken conversation with someone trying not to laugh at me\
  \ for my dismal Spanish, bumping my head for the umpteenth time on a fast combi\
  \ and smiling at the passenger opposite, or receiving a sample of local cuisine\
  \ in an aromatic market, I\u2019ve been inundated with warmth. \n\nI have travelled\
  \ on my own but never have I taken a complete leap of faith to jump into the unknown.\
  \ But this changed after I found myself in a state of personal crisis. Constant\
  \ dread, waking up in fear and feeling like my chest was being crushed defined the\
  \ better part of the previous year. I had made a terrible decision with a job change\
  \ and felt like I was drowning every day, working in an office where I felt unwelcome\
  \ and disrespected as a young woman.\n\nI decided the only way to fix the problem\
  \ was to quit my job and start something completely different in a country I had\
  \ never been, with a language I don\u2019t speak.\n\nThis is how I found myself\
  \ in Tehuac\xE1n, Mexico. A small city four-and-a-half hours south of the capital\
  \ to teach English. It all happened quickly without much thought involved, just\
  \ a feeling and my intuition telling me this was right. \n\nIn Tehuac\xE1n, the\
  \ noise is constant. Finding a quiet place in the city seems like a prize I\u2019\
  ve earned for good behaviour over the week. Gas trucks boom a song, the water pump\
  \ screams every time someone turns on a tap, and juice carts blast pop tunes tunes\
  \ from decades past. The sidewalks are either busy with people or with countless\
  \ stray dogs inconveniently napping in a sunny spot. The contrast to orderly Toronto,\
  \ where I\u2019m from, is profound.\n\nThe city itself is nestled in a valley surrounded\
  \ by leafy mountains. The street art is incredible and finding new murals or little\
  \ spray-painted images is like a secret treasure hunt I\u2019ve given myself. The\
  \ food stalls, to satisfy lovers of both savoury and sweet, are ever present and\
  \ everything is delicious. The accessibility of the inter-city bus has allowed me\
  \ to experience and explore the culture and beauty of Mexico.\n\nI have been in\
  \ Mexico for over two months and feel happier than ever. Deriding my fears to jump\
  \ into the unknown has been a wonderful decision. I now realize it was actually\
  \ a leap of faith that I took in myself."
