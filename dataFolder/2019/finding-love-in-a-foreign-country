Text: "I didn't expect to find love in Romania. Maybe things were simpler then, it\
  \ certainly felt like that, getting off the plane in what seemed like the 1960's.\
  \ The further we travelled, the further back in history we seemed to go. Everything\
  \ there was foreign to me: The people, their language, driving on the right/wrong\
  \ side of the road - I didn't understand a thing, but when I was with Iulian...\
  \ everything made sense. We'd travelled there together, to spend Easter with his\
  \ family - the father of his friend had come to collect us from the tattered old\
  \ airport in Bacau, they talked as I admired my surroundings. At first, that might\
  \ sound strange, given how I described them, but this was only the second airport\
  \ I had ever been in, and to me... it was beautiful.\n\tThe journey to his grandparents'\
  \ house was long. I spent this time switching between falling asleep and staring\
  \ out of the window, Iulian asked what I was looking at and I simply repied, \"\
  Romania\". The city was a stark reminder of the country's communist past with its\
  \ unattractive concrete blocks that expanded into the sky, not there to be anything\
  \ other than somewhere to live. As we slowly moved onto the ragged 'roads' of the\
  \ countryside, the view became far more picturesque - similar to what you would\
  \ see in a traveller's guide. An expanse of unkempt grass lay on every side and\
  \ a compliment of vivid mansions were dotted between, even the many that remained\
  \ unfinished were head and shoulders above the dull brick houses you would find\
  \ in Engand. \n        When we finally reached the small village of his grandparents,\
  \ I was tired, like the simple houses of the village around me. But his family couldn't\
  \ have been more energetic. His grandpa had come outside to help with the bags,\
  \ and his grandma - to greet us with hugs and kisses. They all understood that I\
  \ would like to rest and I was shown to a quaint wooden bed, in Iulian's childhood\
  \ bedroom, with a duvet thick enough to trap you in sleep. When I woke, I was shown\
  \ into the kitchen where I was presented with the bors, his grandma was concerned\
  \ I hadn't eaten on arrival, and the tuicca I would proceed to get drunk on. After\
  \ dinner, Iulian tok me to see the mny animals that wee being kept outside. That\
  \ night, standing drunkenly in a foreign country, amongst the stars, his family\
  \ and a small-petting zoo -I really felt like I was home."
