Text: "I arrived in Antalya after a 12 hour flight tired and hungry. I found my way\
  \ to the bus station in the city, purchased my ticket and boarded the bus to begin\
  \ my 4 hour journey to Denizli. This was my first time travelling alone and also\
  \ my first visit to Turkey.\nI had been sold the wrong ticket and began my journey\
  \ into the unknown; unaware. After a pleasant 4.5 hour bus journey I arrived in\
  \ Konya at another bus station. No one spoke English. I was lost and alone.\nI eventually\
  \ found someone who spoke English who kindly helped me purchase the correct bus\
  \ ticket to Denizli and once again I began my journey. Around 6 hours later I arrived\
  \ in Denizli exhausted. It was 1am and and as the bus pulled away from the station\
  \ I was greeted by some young men calling out \u201CHey lady! You want boyfriend?\u201D\
  \ It was dark, there were no taxis and the bus station was empty. I started to panic\
  \ a little my phone was dead and I had forgotten my charger. I spotted a pastry\
  \ shop within the bus station which was open. An attractive young man served me\
  \ a coffee and a delicious cheese filled pastry. There was a hotel close to the\
  \ bus station I enquired if he could call and book me a room. \u201CNo! You can\u2019\
  t stay there. It\u2019s not for a woman travelling alone\u201D. At this stage I\
  \ was so tired I would have slept on the floor. Then I remembered I had joined a\
  \ Turkish language group online and a guy who had helped me learn basic bits of\
  \ Turkish had given me his number to use in an emergency. I had written it in my\
  \ phrase book. I asked if there was a payphone to call my \u2018friend\u2019. \u201C\
  No problem I can call for you\u201D, replied the young man. 30 minutes later Murat\
  \ arrived with his car to take me to his home for the evening. I got in the car\
  \ the voice in my head saying \u201CAre you insane? You don\u2019t even know this\
  \ guy!\u201D I no longer cared. \nMurat was a kind gentle man who spoke very little\
  \ English and as I spoke pretty much no Turkish it was a little awkward. He was\
  \ excited to have a visitor and made me up a bed on his sofa in the living room\
  \ gave me tea and off to sleep I went. I was awakened at 5.30am by the smell of\
  \ cooking and Murat pointing to large tray with a variety of foods Sausage, olives,\
  \ eggs, sheep\u2019s cheese, yoghurt, bread and tea. \u201CBreakfast?\u201D Murat\
  \ asked. I thanked him I was so hungry. I joined him on the floor and we ate breakfast\
  \ together. After breakfast he explained he had to go to work and would return that\
  \ evening. He showed me the fridge in case I got hungry.\nI was alone in his flat.\
  \ Everything on TV was in Turkish. It was so hot it had to be around 40 degrees.\
  \ There was no air conditioning. \nI showered and dressed in a white gypsy skirt\
  \ paired with a black vest and heels. I looked around for a letter with his address.\
  \ I wrote it down on paper, popped it in my bag and decided to go out. \nI walked\
  \ for about 10 minutes and found a bus stop. I now realised I should have worn more\
  \ suitable footwear. After a 20 minute wait a minibus arrived. I boarded. There\
  \ were no seats available and a few people standing. I tried to stand forward of\
  \ the guy carrying a chicken. The air was hot and dusty and the guy behind me was\
  \ sniffing me, seriously, I gave him a look hoping he would stop. It made no difference.\
  \ After 20 minutes the bus pulled in to Denizli centre. As I climbed down the large\
  \ steps I scraped my heel and I was now bleeding and in pain. I looked around for\
  \ a shoe store for a while and eventually found one where I purchased the most delightful\
  \ white beaded kitten heeled mules. Totally impractical but so pretty. Now for my\
  \ adventure to begin.."
