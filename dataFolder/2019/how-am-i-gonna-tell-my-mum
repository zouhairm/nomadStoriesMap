Text: "To start a story as if it were a joke may hide the dunes and hot tea small\
  \ dramas of what this has been constructed. But if we all laughed at the end I can\
  \ risk the typical: it was a South Korean, a Chinese, a Japanese and a Portuguese\
  \ in a jeep on the way to the Jordanian desert.\n\nThat morning everything was lined\
  \ up to run as planned: catch the bus that would take me from Petra to an accommodation\
  \ in the middle of Wadi Rum, the best known Jordanian desert, and spend two nights\
  \ away from it all, sleeping under the stars. \n\nWhen in the middle of the trip,\
  \ we are told that the journey from there would be made by jeep we didn\u2019t question\
  \ because, hey, after all, we could not go to the dunes of the desert in a bus.\
  \ But a stop in a kind of market to buy lunch ( \"You go to the desert, you are\
  \ not expecting to have restaurants, are you?\") and another at the driver\u2019\
  s home where I find myself among my new Western friends eating crackers and drinking\
  \ tea while for a new exchange of vehicle, this time due to an encouraging battery\
  \ problems begin to seem all but a crossing in the desert.\n\nWe follow. Not confident.\
  \ The new driver does not speak English. We follow for hours of immense heat, a\
  \ thousand turns, half a dozen \"points of interest\" and here we are dumped in\
  \ a tent in the middle of nowhere, drowned in more tea. Here\u2019s our adventure\
  \ in the Jordanian desert. I've seen ads accommodation at all true to reality, but\
  \ this was the pinnacle.\n\nWhile the South Korean and the Chinese seemed perfectly\
  \ installed, I asked to call the head of the bus that had brought us from Petra.\
  \ No one spoke English, but the phone is a more or less universal concept. I was\
  \ told that there had been conflicts in the Israeli embassy in Amman and, therefore,\
  \ the road to the desert had been closed to tourists protection. But our cicerones\
  \ did not want to lose money and \"offered us\" a guided tour of secondary roads.\
  \ Should I be grateful to them for something I did not ask, of which I was not informed?\
  \ Thank you, but I want to go back to the village. Yes, I pay such a visit and the\
  \ night that this gentleman here who\u2019s drowning us in tea will lose.\n\nEndless\
  \ hours later, the driver of the accommodation where I had appointed arrived to\
  \ take me away. A few more minutes of insistence to take the Japanese, who did not\
  \ know what he was doing there either. Along the way, the option: do we want to\
  \ pay half of what we would pay for the pension in the village and stay at my house\
  \ tonight? We looked at each other and the only thing we knew was that we did not\
  \ want to give up on our adventure in the desert.\n\nWe ended in a Jordanian Desert\
  \ Bedouin home, me dancing with the girls, the Japanese playing football with the\
  \ boys. Using technologies to understand the traditions of each other,  eating on\
  \ the ground, with our hand, the youngest in my legs. Two makeshift beds in the\
  \ yard floor. And before we surrender to sleep with that starry sky above our heads,\
  \ thousands of kilometers from home, we agreed in Portuguese and Japanese: \"how\
  \ am I going tell this to my mother?\"."
