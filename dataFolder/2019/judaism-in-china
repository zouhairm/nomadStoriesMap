Text: "Today, I was privileged to visit the Chabad\u2014a denomination of Orthodox\
  \ Judaism\u2014house in Beijing. As a Jew, it is fascinating to learn more about\
  \ Jewish communities outside of the United States. Since I am here in Beijing, I\
  \ felt that I could not leave the city or country without visiting the local congregation.\
  \ At the same time, being part of religion which most locals do not know about has\
  \ been eye-opening.\nIt was quite difficult to actually find the synagogue on the\
  \ internet, as I later found out since it is not one of the five legal religions\
  \ in China. As such, as one of the rabbis at the Chabad explained, the synagogue\
  \ is advertised as a museum and restaurant. It holds a small kosher restaurant and\
  \ Jewish exhibit but primarily is a synagogue. The Chinese government very much\
  \ knows about its existence and allows it to exist within these constraints. It\
  \ observes and monitors the synagogue through several cameras and knows exactly\
  \ who enters and exits the building. Despite the illegality of Judaism, the Chabad\
  \ rabbi told me that he felt safer and more welcome here in China than anywhere\
  \ else in the world, besides Kfar Chabad which is a Chabad city in Israel. He explained\
  \ how China does not have a history of anti-Semitism and that the Chinese people\
  \ do not judge Jews, attaching to them any stigmas. To me, this seems almost contradictory;\
  \ how can a Jew be fully free if Judaism is on paper illegal? At the same time,\
  \ several Chinese people have told me about religious freedom in China and how the\
  \ Chinese government is accepting of Judaism. The status of Judaism and other illegal\
  \ religions is more complicated than I understand, and I am curious to return to\
  \ learn more about the nuance of the Chinese-Jewish relations.\nWhile it was difficult\
  \ to get to the Chabad, it was certainly worth it. I enjoyed learning about the\
  \ rich history of the various Jewish communities in China and how the congregation\
  \ integrates elements from the various previous synagogues: especially through the\
  \ architecture of the building which adapted features from synagogues in Shanghai,\
  \ Harbin, Tianjin, Hailar, Hong Kong, and Kaifeng. At the same time, the synagogue\
  \ felt very familiar to me, reminding me of the congregations that I have visited\
  \ back in the United States. Even just entering the building, I was able to speak\
  \ with the rabbi in Hebrew as if we were old friends.\nBeing a Jew in China has\
  \ broadened my horizons in many ways. In New York, it is very common for others\
  \ to be familiar with Judaism. Here in China when I mention my religion, many people\
  \ look blankly back at me, as they have never heard of Judaism before. While there\
  \ is a small Jewish community here in Beijing and China generally, many Chinese\
  \ do not know of Judaism or the local community. This experience has taught me to\
  \ be more conscious of others and assume less."
