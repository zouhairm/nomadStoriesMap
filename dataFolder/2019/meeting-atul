Text: "I had taken a train on Delhi\u2019s metro, then almost brand spanking new,\
  \ from the outermost rim to its oldest district, Chandni Chawk. The Scottish watercolourist,\
  \ William Simpson painted Chandni Chalk in 1858 and I had brought paper, intending\
  \ to make sketches. I felt the chasm of time open up when nowhere could I see the\
  \ quiet, wide streets, shaded by huge trees, Simpson had depicted. Chandni Chawk\
  \ in 2014 was banded with orange and grey fugs of pollution. In the narrowest streets,\
  \ the air, permeated by the heat of a million air conditioners made my nose run\
  \ instantly black, and a migraine began. Determined to capture some sense of this\
  \ place I walked on, eventually, overwhelmed by the fumes and chaos, sagging on\
  \ the step of a jewellery shop. A small shrine stood on the side of the street,\
  \ its roof being repaired. Beside it large, speakers rasped out Hindu mantras at\
  \ painfully loud decibels. \n\nMy head was pounding and I focused at the ground\
  \ in front, trying to contain, if not blot out the cacophony, and my own horrible\
  \ alienation. Into this frame of view came a slight young man, dragging himself\
  \ along the ground. I watched mesmerised as he half slid, half crawled past me and\
  \ on down the street, pulling himself on hands bound with fabric. As he disappeared\
  \ from view I had an impulse to roll up paper, stuff camera into bag, and follow\
  \ him. But he had moved surprising quickly through crowds which were thick as to\
  \ obscure all view of the street. I don\u2019t know why I panicked, and started\
  \ right, then left, then straight on, towards the heart of the Chawk. But when I\
  \ nearly fell over him I felt a great wave of relief. He had paused on his way and\
  \ was looking through the crowd. People were stepping over him without regard, as\
  \ they had been perhaps all his life. But there was not a trace of bitterness in\
  \ his expression as he looked at them, and then at me. In my halting Hindi, I introduced\
  \ myself and learned that his name was Atul. I showed him my paintings, and asked\
  \ if I could draw his portrait. \n\nAtul agreed and, with nowhere to sit, we huddled\
  \ with the garbage on the footpath, people stepping over us. The great writer and\
  \ artist John Berger spoke of drawing as a path to empathy, an experience offering\
  \ transcendence as in a sense you merge with your subject, and become \u2018real\u2019\
  \ in that moment. This happened for me as I gazed on Atul\u2019s face to make the\
  \ drawing. The chaos of the street faded away, replaced by details of his expression\
  \ and appearance. These spoke of someone who had taken pains to present himself\
  \ gracefully to the world. His hair was combed and beard immaculate; the collar\
  \ of his old shirt was beautifully pressed, in contrast to his trousers, tattered\
  \ from contact with the ground, and his hands bandaged in rags. All these details\
  \ imprinted on my mind. With the drawing completed, I thanked Atul. I offered him\
  \ money, which he accepted, and we went our separate ways. But the meeting continued\
  \ to work on me. For months after as I worked on his portrait I wondered about him,\
  \ about his lack of anger at the world, and about what he had taught me of Hindu\
  \ ideas of destiny and fate. I was angry that he was forced to negotiate the world\
  \ on hands and knees, that I had seen nobody take interest nor stop to assist, and\
  \ at my own lack of capacity to help. I wondered who guided him over the filthy\
  \ and dangerous floor of the city. Most of all I wondered about the expression on\
  \ his young, old, face which haunted me and which had held neither resignation,\
  \ pain, or contempt. Atul had expressed something I can only describe as an inner\
  \ spring of compassion and awareness. It was only much later while writing that\
  \ I recalled I had met him at the shrine."
