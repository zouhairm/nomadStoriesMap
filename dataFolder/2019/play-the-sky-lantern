Text: "Paper lanterns propelled by flame have existed in Asia for thousands of years\
  \ as means of communication and celebration. Despite the potential fire hazard,\
  \ inscribing a lantern with your hopes for the future and releasing it from the\
  \ train tracks in Pingxi is a popular activity in Taiwan all year round, but especially\
  \ during the annual lantern festival.\n\n\u201CWill you play the sky lantern?\u201D\
  \ called the owner of a small booth by the train tracks in Pingxi as I passed by,\
  \ after a muggy day of hiking in Shifen.\n\nSecuring my business, she showed me\
  \ a card with the meanings of different colored lanterns. A red lantern will bring\
  \ you good health, while a light blue one will ensure that \u201Ceverything goes\
  \ well at work.\u201D \n\nI used a dripping brush to paint my hopes on the front\
  \ of a multi-colored lantern. After the ink dried, a young Taiwanese man who was\
  \ working on his own lantern (he hoped to do well at work, I saw) helped me carry\
  \ it onto the train tracks.\n\nWe stood facing each other, pinching the top corners\
  \ of the billowing lantern that stood almost chest high to me. The stall owner lit\
  \ the paper fuel at the bottom that would propel the lantern into the now inky sky.\
  \ \n\nAt the first spark, the lantern was flooded with light and heat. The majesty\
  \ of the moment was abruptly cut short when our fingers began to scorch. At the\
  \ woman\u2019s gesture, my new friend and I lifted the lantern, thankfully shifting\
  \ our grip to the metal rim below the flame, relieved to find it cool after the\
  \ heat of the paper.\n\nWe held it steady for a moment, while the woman counted\
  \ down. \u201CS\u0101n, \xE8r, y\u012B!\u201D she exclaimed. As she reached \u2018\
  one\u2019 in Chinese, we let go, and the lantern surged upward, born by the heat\
  \ of the flame and the evening breeze of rural Taiwan. \n\n\u201CPlay!\u201D cried\
  \ the woman, throwing her hands into the air in delight, before applauding profusely.\
  \ Though her English was as limited as my Chinese, her enthusiasm was infectious,\
  \ and the two of us joined in her ovation. \n\nAfter watching my lantern make its\
  \ ascent, I bid my new friends farewell and started back to the train station in\
  \ the warm, Taiwanese twilight. \n\nI didn\u2019t turn to watch as its light shrank\
  \ in the sky. If a stray breeze knocked it askew, extinguishing the flame or setting\
  \ the delicate paper alight, I didn\u2019t want to see it fall. The laws of gravity\
  \ ensure that they all come down eventually, but the last thing I saw was my lantern\
  \ rising, buoyed by the physics of heat and also surely by the hopes inscribed on\
  \ it, illuminated in the night sky."
