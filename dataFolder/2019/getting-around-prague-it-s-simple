Text: "It was snowing and dark when we arrived in Prague. In Old Town the cobbles\
  \ outside our hostel were crusted with snow. Inside, its gloomy staircase and chilly\
  \ rooms unwelcoming.\n\_\nFor two days the sky was heavy with clouds, and Prague\
  \ remained gray and opaque. Buildings rose above us, the Charles Bridge stretched\
  \ gray across Vltava River and the astronomical clock was cloaked in scaffolding.\
  \ Though we made our way around the city, we were skimming the surface, missing\
  \ its stories. \n\_\nAfter two nights we needed to move: the hostel\u2019s dim kitchen\
  \ and thin blankets weren't helping me settle. When we trudged into Hostel Downtown,\
  \ the trip changed before my eyes. Here was a place full of light and color, vibrant\
  \ and warm. By next morning we were signed up for walking tour. That's when we met\
  \ our guide, Mirek.\n\_\_\nThrough Mirek\u2019s stories, Prague blossomed before\
  \ me. We flipped back the rug in a church, searched for stone markers, passed between\
  \ pastel colored buildings and gazed at painted ceilings. Mirek\u2019s love of the\
  \ city brought it to life. After a few days of walking together, he invited us out\
  \ for an evening: come see me at the Old Town Bridge Tower, then we'll go to a club\
  \ where my band is playing.\n\_\nThe dark stones of the 14th century Old Town Bridge\
  \ Tower loomed over the Charles Bridge. Winding up the stairs, the stones were smooth\
  \ underfoot. Mirek was closing it down, so we had the place to ourselves. Outside\
  \ we leaned against the rail, Prague Castle casting gold and rose lights on the\
  \ black waters of the Vltava. We took in the scene: people on the bridge, the rooftops\
  \ of Mala Strana, the lights on Petrin Tower.\n\_\nMy husband locked up the tower\
  \ with a pitted, black skeleton key, then we followed Mirek through Stare Mesto,\
  \ brushing past Old Town Square. We'd been here before, but this was no tour; we\
  \ were moving fast. At the metro station Mirek pointed to the ticket machine with\
  \ its many choices, all in Czech. \"It is easy, Renee. This button for Old Town,\
  \ this button for anywhere else. You see? Simple,\"\_he said.\n\_\nAfter the metro\
  \ we took a bus, then hit the street. We followed Mirek into a stone building pulsing\
  \ with people. Under an archway we watched as Mirek blew his horn, the lights flashed\
  \ green and red, the crowd danced. We stayed for a spirited German band. When the\
  \ show broke up we headed upstairs and it was clear that Mirek was gone.\n\nOut\
  \ in the spring night it was easy to find the bus stop and then the metro station.\
  \ We felt confident until we walked down the steps: why was no one here? Then we\
  \ realized\_the metro closed at midnight. Back on the sidewalk we looked down the\
  \ dark streets. We had no idea where we were.\n\_\nAround the corner we found a\
  \ tram stop, but the map told us little. I asked a couple of young Czech guys, \"\
  Do you speak English?\" No, no. There was one word in Czech I had memorized \u2013\
  \ the name of our street. They got on their phones, found the tram number, and gave\
  \ it to me with hand signals.\n\_\nWe waited in a puddle of light, the city dark\
  \ around us. Crowds swelled and thinned as people went on their way. When our tram\
  \ finally came we rode in silence, wondering if we were going the right direction\
  \ and how we would know if we were.\n\_\nAs the map on my phone gave names of major\
  \ streets, I started to feel like we were getting closer. Then my husband said he\
  \ saw a patch of sidewalk that looked familiar, and we jumped off.  There it was:\
  \ the gleaming head! The kinetic Statue of Kafka was remaking itself, and we knew\
  \ exactly where we were. Minutes later we sank into our bed.\n\_\nThe next morning\
  \ Mirek explained that he couldn't find us and had gotten a ride home with the drummer.\
  \ \"But you made it, \u201Che said, \u201CI told you it was simple.\" And with that,\
  \ we jumped on a train and headed to Karlstejn Castle."
