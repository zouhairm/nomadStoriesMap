Text: "Pudong Airport:\n \nThe plane was boarding. Gate 16, flight number 368, destination\
  \ Los Angeles. I was still re-reading Philip's texts with a million thoughts going\
  \ through my head \u201Cdon\u2019t do it,\" \"don't board the plane\u201D they read.\
  \ I remember munching on some Chinese candies out of anxiety thinking: What if?\
  \ What if I just stay? Could I? While standing in line, I grabbed my sister\u2019\
  s arm and said the once thought impossible \u201CI\u2019m staying.\u201D\n \nOne\
  \ Month Prior:\n\nMy sister and I arrived to Shanghai just in time for the Chinese\
  \ New Year celebrations: The Year of the Dragon. The entire city was dressed in\
  \ red and had been showered with bright paper lanterns. There were intricate decorations\
  \ wherever we looked, it was a true feast to our eyes. The lively atmosphere made\
  \ us even more excited to witness such a significant cultural event, and since it\
  \ was our first time in China, we were eager to immerse ourselves in the culture.\n\
  \ \nIt was at a celebration that I met Philip, a young, serious man of very few\
  \ words, but with the most interesting mind I had yet encountered. We shared an\
  \ instant connection, and what followed next, were very unusual days of exploring\
  \ a foreign city and getting to know each other. \nFor the most part, during this\
  \ process, I felt like I was spinning on a cloud. I even walked the streets of Shanghai\
  \ in a state of wonder; dancing to a soundtrack of otherworldly beauty that played\
  \ only in my head. I was easily absorbing the little details of the rich history\
  \ of the French Concession, its shops, indie boutiques, and distinct corners. Savoring\
  \ getting lost in the alleys of the Old Town, browsing antique shops and visiting\
  \ century-old temples. Everything was mesmerizing to me. The smog that filled the\
  \ air was somehow sweeter, and the sky brighter. This trip had quickly become a\
  \ fascinating adventure, and Philip was undeniably at the center of it all. There\
  \ I was, in a new city with someone I had just met, and it all felt strangely familiar\
  \ to me, like I had known both for a very long time already.\n\nPudong Airport:\n\
  \nI walked away from the gate nervously, phone heavily pressed on the ear and talking\
  \ to Philip. I felt like a run-away, like I was escaping. I couldn't believe I was\
  \ willing to stay in Shanghai with no suitcase, an expired visa and after only having\
  \ known Philip for a few days. I was convinced I had lost my mind. My hands started\
  \ shaking, and as soon as I saw the plane take off from the airport window, my heart\
  \ sank and reality hit. I had stayed. \nAs I walked outside the airport, I took\
  \ a deep breath of that Shanghai air and hailed a cab to town: \u201CNi Hao,\u201D\
  \ I greeted the cabbie with a smile. But my heart was still beating fast, and I\
  \ couldn't decide if it was the adrenaline of not boarding the plane, or simply\
  \ the fact that I was going to see Philip again. To this day, I still don't know.\
  \ But one thing is for sure, when I arrived to Shanghai I was hungry for discovery\
  \ and looking for adventure, what I didn't expect to find was a deep and long-lasting\
  \ bond, both with a magical city and with a special person."
