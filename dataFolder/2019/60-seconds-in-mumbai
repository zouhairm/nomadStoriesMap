Text: "\u201CHello, ma\u2019am! Hello ma\u2019am!\u201D You tap insistently on the\
  \ taxi window and put your tiny hand to your mouth to show me you\u2019re hungry.\
  \ \n\nWe\u2019re surrounded by three-wheeled green and yellow tuk-tuks competing\
  \ for space with brightly painted diesel trucks coughing fumes. A Brahmin cow wearing\
  \ garlands of orange flowers noses garbage.\n\nI worry for your fragile life, a\
  \ dot in the web of Mumbai traffic. My fear is strengthened by reading the local\
  \ newspaper with its full-page spread of photographs of unidentified bodies. There\u2019\
  s a picture of a small, crumpled child with an ad asking readers if they recognize\
  \ you. They\u2019ve guessed your age and list the road where you were found.\n\n\
  But today, that\u2019s not you, and I put my hand on the window, covering your smaller\
  \ one on the other side. A pane of glass is all that separates my privilege from\
  \ your vulnerability. You puncture my heart, but I\u2019ve been warned repeatedly\
  \ I shouldn\u2019t give food or money. It doesn\u2019t go to you, it goes to someone\
  \ else. You are just a pawn. \n\nI\u2019ve been told the poor are happy\u2026just\
  \ never by the poor. \n\nI\u2019m tempted to stare straight ahead and pretend you\u2019\
  re not there, but I can\u2019t. Your face is inches from mine and I don\u2019t need\
  \ to know Marathi to understand you\u2019re pleading with me. I wish I were enjoying\
  \ one of India\u2019s more comfortable experiences right now \u2014 bargaining in\
  \ the market or drinking a cup of masala chai. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D\
  \ I ask, and my colleague interprets. I don\u2019t remember what it was, but I regret\
  \ I didn\u2019t tell you it was a beautiful name for a beautiful girl. Instead I\
  \ tell you I wish circumstances in India will change and you will have a chance\
  \ for a better life. A future with more options than being a master dodger and weaver\
  \ of traffic and one that delays the harsh realities of life.  \n\nI wonder where\
  \ you sleep, and if you\u2019ll ever have the chance to go to school. You\u2019\
  ve learned lessons by now that most people don\u2019t learn until much later, and,\
  \ I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve learned some lessons we both wish you didn\u2019t have\
  \ to learn at all. \n\nThe red light turns green. You turn, none the richer, and\
  \ sprint back to the median, melting into a maze of vehicles. My air-conditioned\
  \ cab \u2014 that shields me from the heat and your unwashed face and skinny limbs\
  \ \u2014 pitches into the chaos of a thousand honking horns."
