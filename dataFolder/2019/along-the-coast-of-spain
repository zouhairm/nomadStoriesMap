Text: "The space was small, loud with chatter and full with closeness and conversation.\
  \ It felt like walking into a second cousin\u2019s house for Thanksgiving dinner\
  \ \u2014 warm, welcoming, inviting \u2014 like family, but with the lingering sense\
  \ of being on the outside looking in.\n\nI was visiting my friend, Tara, in Spain,\
  \ where she\u2019d moved to be on staff with a leadership academy. With a few short\
  \ days left of my trip, we decided to rent a car and explore the Costa del Sol.\
  \ \n\nLuckily, America and Spain share a mutual understanding of the correct side\
  \ of the road. However, our two countries do not share an affinity for automatic\
  \ transmissions. Tara doesn\u2019t know how to drive a stick shift, but I do.\n\n\
  If any other friend had tried to talk me into driving a stick \u2014 something I\
  \ hadn\u2019t done in over three years \u2014 while halfway across the world, I\
  \ would\u2019ve adamantly declined. The planner in me didn\u2019t like the idea\
  \ of being out of control, and the rough lurching of my unpracticed foot on the\
  \ clutch would surely feel just that. \n\nBut there\u2019s something about Tara.\
  \ She feels like family. And there\u2019s something about family that gives me the\
  \ confidence to try. \n\nPlus it did sound poetic, cruising along the coast \u2014\
  \ the mountains rising on one side, the sea spread out to meet the sky on the other.\
  \ No real plans other than to end the day at a tapas party in Mijas, where I would\
  \ meet more of her community here in Spain. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until we were several\
  \ miles down the highway that my heart resumed its normal pitter-patter. My hands\
  \ relaxed on the steering wheel. I sat back in the seat, taking in the view. \n\n\
  Josh Garrels\u2019 soulful voice poured from the speakers. \n\n   Farther along\
  \ we'll know all about it,\n   Farther along we'll understand why;\n   Cheer up\
  \ my brother, live in the sunshine,\n   We'll understand it all by and by.\n\nThe\
  \ empty highway hugged the coastline, stretching out before us with anticipation.\
  \ We drove from Malaga to Marbella, from Marbella to Fuengirola. We stopped for\
  \ lunch at a beachfront cafe, picking at tapas with salty fingers. We lingered over\
  \ cocktails in the shadow of yachts we could only dream of ever boarding. We sipped\
  \ coffees, nibbled on pastries, and spent time catching up on the past and dreaming\
  \ of the future. \n\nThe sunshine and ocean breeze made me feel light, but my mind\
  \ wandered back to the reality that awaited me in Chicago \u2014 a new job, one\
  \ I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d like. The conversation, while full of promise, was\
  \ also heavy with questions about what was next.\n\nAs day transitioned to night\
  \ we headed inland, leaving the coast of Fuengirola for the hills of Mijas. This\
  \ was the village I had heard so much about, and at one point thought I, too, might\
  \ call home. \n\nWe stepped through the back door, leaving the cool, quiet evening\
  \ for the warm hum of a living room. Everywhere I turned I was greeted with a heartfelt\
  \ hug and a new name. Faces flying by, one by one turning from stranger to friend.\
  \ A glass of wine was pressed into my hand, plates of food were offered. It was\
  \ overwhelming, yet energizing. \n\nI met two American girls who were students in\
  \ the leadership program. We stood in a doorframe chatting, our words mingling with\
  \ bits of other conversations as people passed us by. I began to feel less like\
  \ a guest and more at home. Their time in Spain was coming to a close and they were\
  \ unsure what was next. Maybe Chicago. \n\nThat maybe turned to a yes, those girls\
  \ from friends to roommates. The unknowns never seem to cease, but we continue to\
  \ give each other the trust to try. \n\nWhen asked how we met, we always smile and\
  \ laugh, remembering a party in a small house in Spain. A night when I planned to\
  \ leave with a belly full of wine and tapas and a tale of a lovely road trip. What\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect was that my family would grow by two that day along the coast\
  \ of Spain."
