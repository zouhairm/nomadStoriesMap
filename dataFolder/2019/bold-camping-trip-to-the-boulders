Text: "And now, what? I understood what an adrenaline rush is as I was trying to remember\
  \ everything or at least anything from the instructional videos we watched before\
  \ we left town, before settling in the middle of nowhere, with no reception or any\
  \ means to call for help. If 12 years ago, when we first met, someone had told me\
  \ and my friend, Claudia, that she\u2019ll move to Australia and the second time\
  \ I\u2019d visit her, she\u2019ll accidentally have her baby in this sacred aboriginal\
  \ place with me as a doula, I would have called that person a dangerous lunatic.\
  \ But there she was, and there was I, in the darkness, helplessly crawling out of\
  \ the white hippie van/self-built home on wheels, almost stepping on Liviu\u2019\
  s head in the process, struggling to accept the fact that this is real. I got to\
  \ the blue tent just in time to hear : \u201CYou can\u2019t be giving birth now,\
  \ Clau, what day is it? The 6th? You\u2019re due on the 24th! Oh don't you tell\
  \ me I'm not, because I'm definitely giving birth now, IF YOU\u2019LL EXCUSE ME!\u201D\
  . Alex used the last 3% phone battery power to convince himself with the flashlight\
  \ that he\u2019s becoming a dad rather sooner than expected and felt like he was\
  \ going to faint. \u2018Now\u2019s not the time, Alex!\u2019. 4 deep breaths later\
  \ (for him) and 3 contractions later (for her), he was back into his senses and\
  \ ready to be the hero of this small anonymous campground at Babinda Creek, Queensland,\
  \ the destination we were ready to call `home` for the weekend (the spot is free\
  \ of charge, but limited to 3 nights at a time).  \nJust hours earlier, I was hooked\
  \ by the beauty of Babinda creek from the second I laid eyes on its green surface\
  \ mirroring the trees and vines above, a straightforward invitation to play that\
  \ my inner Mowgli could not resist. We swam, even if the water was cool, joked about\
  \ crocodiles and entered the water in the most ignorant/optimistic way, saying \u2018\
  there are no crocs here\u2019, because there were no warning signs like those commonly\
  \ found in Queensland (as if anyone can really control that, especially in the rainy\
  \ season). When the golden hour came, we climbed to enjoy it on the granite boulders,\
  \ that felt warm and smooth. That is where we found some approximately one-meter\
  \ diameter circular holes that we read about and that were used as natural birthing\
  \ pools by the local aboriginal women. Of course Claudia, my almost 9-month pregnant\
  \ friend, wanted to take a bath in one of those and the \u2018aboriginal magic\u2019\
  \ apparently worked, as 10 hours later, her water broke. \nAfter 3 more hours of\
  \ labor in the tropical heat while Liviu, the world\u2019s most confused uncle,\
  \ kept bringing the wrong objects from the van (screwdrivers instead of nasal aspirator),\
  \ we successfully delivered a healthy baby on a yoga mattress covered in beige beach\
  \ towels, in a tent, while constantly fighting mosquitoes and bugs.  Changing our\
  \ weekend plans for obvious reasons, we packed our things and headed to the nearest\
  \ place where we could find reception, Wi-Fi and last, but not least, food. That\
  \ place happened to be a Thai Restaurant, on the way back to Cairns. The manager\
  \ noticed us parking the van in front of the entrance and opened the door to welcome\
  \ us. And we entered. Barefoot, partially naked and partially covered in blood,\
  \ like a savage hungry tribe, holding a weird basket covered with leaves, with a\
  \ strange cord leading to a baby dressed in a towel. \u201CSounds like a fresh baby,\
  \ congratulations!\u201D the manager said. \u2018Yes, very fresh, 3 hours old!\u201D\
  \ His face turned white and his English turned to Thai, realizing that the basket\
  \ contained the placenta that was still attached to the baby through the cord. \u2018\
  Can we sit down and see a menu, please? Silence. \u2018And we\u2019ll also need\
  \ the Wi-Fi password\u2019. Silence, followed by \u2018DO YOU NEED AN AMBULANCE?\u2019\
  \ \u2018No, sir, first we would like some Pad Thai and the Wi-Fi password\u2019\
  . World record for the \u201Cfreshest\u201D person in a restaurant? Very likely.\
  \ Her name is Zenith, baptized in crocodile-infested waters. Excellent Pad Thai!"
