Text: "We were making a documentary on spiritual possession and were going to Jejuri,\
  \ a famous religious destination in Maharashtra, India, residing the shrine of Lord\
  \ Shiva.\n\nGondhal is a religious prayer ceremony, traditionally performed by many\
  \ in Maharashtra.  It\u2019s generally performed after marriage to bless the newlyweds\
  \ and their families. It\u2019s in these ceremonies, which involve heavy rhythmic\
  \ music, song and dance that people get spiritually possessed. Jejuri has a big\
  \ local ground where many people perform this ceremony in large groups simultaneously,\
  \ hence the destination. \n\nOn reaching Jejuri, we visited the temple of Lord Shiva,\
  \ or Khandoba, as he is locally called. The temple is situated on a hill and one\
  \ has to climb about 750 steps to reach it. There is even a local tradition that\
  \ the husband has to carry his wife in his arms and take her up the steps, the first\
  \ time they visit the temple after marriage. We climbed through the sea of devotees,\
  \ all going to the temple. Small colourful shops skirted the chunky stone steps,\
  \ selling flowers, coconuts, joss sticks and other offerings. We emerged from the\
  \ main doors and were welcomed by the colourful visual of the grand ancient temple.\
  \ The stone monument was covered generously in yellow, as thousands of devotees\
  \ offered and hurled turmeric in the air, and bowed and rolled on the stone floored\
  \ courtyard, all chanting in a thunderous unison, \u201Cyelkot, yelkot, Jai Malhar\u201D\
  ; praises to Lord Shiva.\n\nWe interviewed one of the priests who told us about\
  \ the history of the temple and about the Gondhal ceremony and its rituals. On our\
  \ way down we interviewed a couple of Vaghyas, male musicians who perform the Gondhal\
  \ for the host family, and Murlis, women who dance on the rhythmic prayers in the\
  \ ceremony. They all told us about how certain people, who are blessed by the Gods\
  \ and Goddesses, get possessed by them and start dancing in the ceremony. With each\
  \ interview my curiosity grew, as I had never seen someone spiritually possessed.\n\
  \nWe reached the local ground. Hundreds of cars and trucks were parked on the periphery.\
  \ As we entered the brown dusty ground we saw that there were thousands of people\
  \ scattered in groups, performing the ceremony in the open. Under a large banyan\
  \ tree, at the entrance, hundreds of people were sacrificing goats for the ceremony.\
  \ The ceremony felt like a family event, where all the members, young and old, came\
  \ to be a part of the rituals. \n\nI still couldn\u2019t see anyone being possessed.\
  \ I quickly ventured to the other corner of the ground and entered a makeshift shelter,\
  \ which was made by tying a large cloth on one side of a truck and supporting it\
  \ with bamboo poles on the other side. A family was performing the ceremony there.\
  \ I was immediately invited on asking for permission to shoot.  The newly married\
  \ couple had just finished their prayers and now the Vaghyas had started chanting\
  \ the devotional songs. Their tenacious voices along with the rhythmic chanting\
  \ of the drums and other percussion instruments had filled the atmosphere with a\
  \ trance like energy. All the family members were seated on the opposite side of\
  \ the Vaghyas, with the shrine and deities in the middle. Suddenly a middle aged\
  \ lady, wearing a printed white-blue sari, started to sway frantically on her knees\
  \ as if in trance. She was possessed.\n\nAnother lady untied the possessed lady\u2019\
  s hair. She began to move rhythmically on her knees, towards the shrine and towards\
  \ me. I could feel a sort of unease in the air. She sprung up with immense energy\
  \ on reaching the shrine and started to jump flinging her hands to the side. I was\
  \ right next to her, recording. Suddenly she laid out her palm. One of the Murlis\
  \ placed a camphor tablet on her hand and lit it. She then placed the burning tablet\
  \ in her mouth. Everyone started praying to her as she was possessed by the Gods.\
  \ The newlywed couple was too made to pray to her.  After a few minutes she closed\
  \ her mouth and fell to the ground. She was normal again."
