Text: "The first time that I registered the presence of them I was near the emblematic\
  \ Dome of the Genbaku, the ruins of the one which is the only building that remained\
  \ standing up after the explosion of \u201CLittle Boy\u201D, the atomic bomb that\
  \ devastated Hiroshima in 1945.\n\nThe sign was saying \u201Cfree classes of origami\u201D\
  . My legs had read \u201CThe last call for sitting and resting a little bit\u201D\
  \ though. While I was waiting for an opportunity to join the next group, I noticed\
  \ that, just like my new teacher, many other senior citizens were wearing the survivor's\
  \ badge. They are the guardians of the history that had the course of the wars changed.\n\
  \nMy tutor was surrounded by children. I couldn't help but notice some adults struggling\
  \ to fit into the tiny footstools while clumsy try to fold the colourful paper,\
  \ a task clearly too delicate to their hands.\n\nThe new classroom had begun. We\
  \ moved smoothly through the introduction\u2019s things and small talks without\
  \ no traits of the weight of the history contained in those old shoulders. We were\
  \ absolutely delighted by the history of the Tsuru sculpture. Legend has it that\
  \ one who makes 1000 Tsurus\u2019 origami will have its wish granted. He also had\
  \ surprised us by teaching how to do some of the symbols of our countries. We were\
  \ nothing but amused by the ostriches and giraffes that were appearing to each fold.\n\
  \nWhen my turn came around, he seemed to hesitate for a moment but it\u2019s taken\
  \ him only one minute to make me a heart. I still remember how my eyes watered while\
  \ he explained, in Portuguese, how Brazil had been essential for Japan on the post-war\
  \ period.\n\nBack to the group, he told us that it was easy learning how to love\
  \ again once he had found, on the other side of the world, people truly opened to\
  \ welcomed a legion of hopeless Japanese marked by the explosion of the atomic bomb\
  \ over Hiroshima.\n\nWith the same lightness that he taught us the art of origami,\
  \ he explained why an 87 years old man goes out of bed every single morning, come\
  \ hell or high water, to share his history. It is because of love\u2019s importance,\
  \ because of the pardon\u2019s importance. That is why a city completely devastated\
  \ by a nuclear bomb could reborn and show us that peace is a war that is worthwhile\
  \ to fight.\n\nAt that time, I did not learn how to fold a flat piece of paper.\
  \ To be honest, if you give me a sheet now, I certainly cannot go further than the\
  \ first step. But I\u2019ve learned something even more important for the world\u2019\
  s current time. I\u2019ve learned the real mean of \u201CTurning the other cheek\u201D\
  \ which is \"rebirth\". And now I know that peace is a worldwide task.\n\nWhen the\
  \ class had finished, he gathered his stuff and invited me for a walk. Whenever\
  \ we were passing for one of his colleagues, he told me their stories. And I\u2019\
  m pleased to say the I lost count of how many times I saw myself laughing out loud\
  \ with the things I had heard. Because the war is a bundle, but the peace is not."
