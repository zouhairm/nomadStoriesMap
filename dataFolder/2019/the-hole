Text: "Wandering the streets of Essaouira, known as a \u201Csmall fortress\u201D,\
  \ I fell into The Hole. I'd heard about it being the only truly authentic bar in\
  \ the city, which wasn\u2019t one bit surprising considering I was in Morocco, a\
  \ country where the vast majority of the population are Muslims. Now I found it\
  \ and stumbled right into the dark niche at the end of the street that marked the\
  \ entrance, not knowing it will become one of my keystone memories of colourful\
  \ Morocco. \n\nA small, shady dive-in bar full of locals in a country where alcohol\
  \ is practically prohibited screamed \u201Cadventure\u201D. I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but look around.\n\n\u201CUnknown but cheap\u201D, one sign claimed. \u201CNo\
  \ photos\u201D, warned another. One look from the man watching over the entrance\
  \ - an equivalent of a bouncer - confirmed that breaking the rules here would be\
  \ one chance you\u2019d regret taking.\n\nThe area was framed by mustard-coloured\
  \ walls covered by a thick layer of smoke that has been settling on them since the\
  \ 1800s. The place has already lived and breathed through several centuries, or\
  \ so I was told later. Given how worn out it appeared, the number seemed about right.\
  \ \n\nI walked through a narrow corridor of tables and chairs, made it through the\
  \ floating ribbons of smoke, eventually reaching the bar where I sat down and ordered\
  \ red wine. Soon enough I found myself having some company.\n\n\u201CAre you Irish?\u201C\
  \ a young Moroccan guy appeared out of nowhere. \u201CNo. I\u2019m Lithuanian\u201D\
  , I said. \u201CHey, that\u2019s not even close. But you do look Irish\u201D, he\
  \ informed me. The guy was easy to talk to and the conversation flowed effortlessly.\
  \ I found out he has never been to Ireland, however, wants to move to Germany. His\
  \ ex-girlfriend was from there, apparently, and he really admires the country, even\
  \ trying to teach himself the language. Remembering the pain of struggling with\
  \ it in high school, his determination impressed me deeply.\n\nHowever, when I inquired\
  \ if it was difficult for him to go there, he explained that even if one didn\u2019\
  t have a problem with the authorities, the flights were crazy expensive - booking\
  \ any flight from Morocco will be at least twice as expensive as booking the exact\
  \ same one from any European country. \n\nSuddenly the bartender interrupted our\
  \ conversation. \u201CLast 20 minutes\u201D, he said. \u201CWe are closing at midnight,\
  \ sharp. Would you like one last round?\u201D\n\nDuring the next 20 minutes, now\
  \ sipping on a tiny bottle of sweet-ish local beer, I learned that the guy earned\
  \ his living by running an eBay business selling gardening supplies. He arranged\
  \ deliveries for companies from all around the world. He also told me he was the\
  \ 3rd year student of English literature, however, contemplating dropping out. I\
  \ suggested switching to a business course instead - there surely must be other\
  \ alternative? \u201CPerhaps\u201D, he answered, \u201Cbut they really are no good\
  \ here. Honestly, I feel stuck. I want to leave Morocco and grow my business because\
  \ what I\u2019m truly good at, but I keep bumping into rock-hard walls\u201D.\n\n\
  A few moments after we were asked to leave. All the guys wished me goodnight and\
  \ I stepped out into the breezy air. \n\nThen it hit me.\n \nNot that I wasn\u2019\
  t aware of it before, how could I not be? I also knew these things were very problematic.\
  \ Yet after spending an evening with these people, listening to the story of a guy\
  \ I just met while the mustard-coloured walls absorbed our laughter I now knew that\
  \ the real hole was not the bar. No, the real hole was our system, both in form\
  \ of laws and the way of thinking that results in perceiving people like this guy\
  \ as a threat. The real hole is the media restlessly blabbering about foreigners\
  \ taking away our jobs, our homes, our land, while the only things we are actually\
  \ in risk of losing are the narrow outlook, stubbornness to accept any change and\
  \ prejudiced patterns of thinking.\n\nWith such thoughts I came back to my room\
  \ and went to bed. But before that I promised myself to do everything in my power\
  \ not to fall into the hole ever again."
