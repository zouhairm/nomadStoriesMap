Text: "I once ever dreamt to travel the world, but then I realized, who am I? I did\
  \ not even have any money to travel my own country, hadn\u2019t been anywhere. For\
  \ your information, I used to live in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The more I grow up,\
  \ the more quotes I read, the greater the desire to travel came to me. I tried countless\
  \ times to join various competitions which the prizes were a free trip to somewhere.\
  \ I even could mention each one of them such as \"Writing To China\" (this one,\
  \ I have 3 shots in three years), \"Energy Essay Competition with Prize Trip to\
  \ Paris\", and so on. And you know what, I never succeeded, so far.\nHowever, life\
  \ always succeeded to surprise me. Last year, I was unexpectedly placed in the northernmost\
  \ province in Indonesia as a civil servant. Yap, it surely something to move thousands\
  \ of miles away from hometown. I got such a culture shock and somehow got me desperate\
  \ that everything was in such a contrary. The locals spoke in a dialect I did not\
  \ even understand, (as a Moslem) finding halal meals was kind of struggle since\
  \ the population\u2019s dominated by Christian, and last but not least, working\
  \ for Statistics Indonesia in the regional level was super exhausting yet surprising\
  \ with its endless work. I could not really proud of my job for its pay, yet, if\
  \ it came in terms of mental experience, I could count myself in.\nMy work\u2019\
  s all about interviewing people, they could be representative of households, government,\
  \ economic activities, farmers, and so on. So I basically collected data about almost\
  \ everything. So, what're so special, especially mental experiences? So here I tell\
  \ you the reason, about the obstacles, oh no, I should call it challenges and things\
  \ that I unexpectedly found here, instead. First, I personally am afraid of the\
  \ dog, and the place where I used to work was full of dogs, almost every house owned\
  \ a dog. It barked to every stranger, and sure, I was so scared every time I need\
  \ to interview the owner of the house. Yet, one year passed, I am getting used to\
  \ it. I am no longer that scared of dogs. I could overcome one of my fears, finally.\
  \ Second, interviewing people who spoke in dialect often got me speechless and I\
  \ needed to go extra miles to explain the purpose of the interview. Moreover, I\
  \ could not choose the ones whom I would interview and what time they had a good\
  \ mood. Truthfully, I was almost driven out by the house owners that I was suspected\
  \ to be a debt collector or even swindler who tried to earn money. Once or twice\
  \ I cried a river and kept questioning what I did wrong that I was treated that\
  \ bad. I did nothing but tried to collect the data as the base of policy made by\
  \ the government and the other stakeholders. However, as time goes by, I realized\
  \ something. I realized that I might not be stronger if I did not taste those bitter\
  \ experiences. In other words, I could proudly say, I was full enough in terms of\
  \ interviewing people, especially in the countryside. Third, in the past 22 years\
  \ of my life, I used to live as a member of the majority in terms of either religion\
  \ or ethnicity, so I found no difficulties at all. Yet, this environment I am staying\
  \ at right now is the opposite. I am currently a member of the minority in terms\
  \ of religion and ethnic. I rarely found a mosque to pray whenever I went to particular\
  \ subdistricts, I rarely found halal food (the locals ate a mouse, dog, bat, or\
  \ even a python) and also the language became boundary somehow. I rarely found who\
  \ could speak Bahasa Indonesia (national Indonesian language). Yet, again, after\
  \ months full of tears (and sweats, of course) I realized that somehow I should\
  \ go out of my comfort zone, try something new, meet new people, make friends with\
  \ strangers and so on. I am thankful for being who I am today. I owe a lot of precious\
  \ experiences in my new environment."
