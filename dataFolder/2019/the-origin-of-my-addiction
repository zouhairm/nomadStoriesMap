Text: "The humidity hits me like a brick. I live in Perth so I'm used to hot weather\
  \ but this is next level. I first feel it when the glass sliding doors of the ARRIVALS\
  \ area opens. The city smells funny but it's the humidity that surprises me the\
  \ most when we leave the air conditioned area. \n\nI am in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,\
  \ en route to Japan on a school exchange program. It is January 1997, I am 17 and\
  \ this is the first time I've been overseas.\n\nWe are staying just one night in\
  \ Kuala Lumpur. The hotel is big and fancy which is interesting but the best thing\
  \ is the view. We are on such a high floor and the view out the window is incredible.\
  \ There are lights as far as we can see; bright lights and flashing lights and dim\
  \ lights and neon signs. I am in a room with 3 of my classmates and no teachers,\
  \ we have two double beds and a bathroom to ourselves. The teachers give us a bottle\
  \ of water each and tell us not to drink the tap water, not to even brush our teeth\
  \ in it.\n\nWe are told to go and have a shower and then meet everyone in the lobby.\
  \ There is a lot of giggling and jumping on the beds but we are down in time and\
  \ discover we are going to KFC for dinner. I overhear the teachers saying that they\
  \ don't trust the restaurants and that KFC would at least be cooked properly and\
  \ have some level of hygiene standards. They tell us it is about five blocks away\
  \ and that we are going to walk there. \n\nThere are around 20 students and my group\
  \ of four are walking with the principal, a kind, older man, close to retirement.\
  \ It is Saturday night, and it is dark, so all the unsavoury types come out of the\
  \ woodwork. We are offered drugs, we see hookers, we hear people shouting. There\
  \ are all sorts of skinned animals hung up in shop windows and everything is written\
  \ in Malaysian. The humidity and the funny smell follows us everywhere. \n\nWe are\
  \ chatting as we walk past a doorway. A drunk man falls out of the doorway almost\
  \ on top of us. On top of us! There are no police, there seem to be no rules and\
  \ the tap water is poisonous. I have never experienced anything like it. I am terrified\
  \ and I walk closer to the principal. We arrive at KFC and eat without incident\
  \ then walk back to the hotel, eyes wide. We are told to be ready to leave at 10am\
  \ the next day to continue to Japan. \n\nUp in our room we are looking awestruck\
  \ out the window as the phone rings. We didn't expect this, maybe it's one of the\
  \ teachers. It is a man with an Asian accent and he asks us to meet him in the lobby.\
  \ We don't know who he is so we tell him we can't go. We say goodbye and hang up.\
  \ He rings again and again and again. He sounds friendly and is with other people\
  \ and they want us to go to the lobby and outside. How does he know what room we\
  \ are in? He must work here or knows someone who does. He says he can see us through\
  \ the window. Our hearts are pounding and we close the curtains. We get into the\
  \ two double beds, turn out the lights and huddle together, terrified. When the\
  \ phone rings again we don't answer it. It eventually stops and as our adrenaline\
  \ drains off we fall asleep. \n\nWe go on to Japan which is fantastic and I experience\
  \ many more firsts. But it is the stopover in Kuala Lumpur that does it. Things\
  \ seem dangerous, unpredictable, and unregulated. Entwined with the fear, I have\
  \ another feeling: quiet thrill. Travelling is different to home and it's risky\
  \ and exciting. I like the unknown and the electric thrill and I want to feel it\
  \ again. \n\nThe relentless craving for that thrill never leaves me and like a drug\
  \ addict, it's a feeling I've been chasing ever since."
