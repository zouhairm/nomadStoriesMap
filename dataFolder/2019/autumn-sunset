Text: "What it comes to mind when you think about Ibiza? Crazy parties, top DJ\u2019\
  s, hot sand beaches and lots of young people. That was exactly what I expected to\
  \ find when I planned my weekend at the island. I never was a big fan of crowds,\
  \ but Ibiza had always been in my bucket list, and I was anxious to live that experience\
  \ at its full.\n \nAfter a week in Barcelona, my friends and I arrived to paradise.\
  \ Since it was a last minute decision, almost none research was done about what\
  \ to do there. After all, it was Ibiza! Beach parties could not be hard to find.\
  \ \n\nHowever, we faced a completely different scenario: a very quiet Ibiza. Empty\
  \ beaches, closed clubs and few tourists. And suddenly I realized: it was November!\
  \ The summer season was long gone and the city had now a completely different vibe.\
  \ Despite of my disappointment, I decided to open my mind and enjoy my time in that\
  \ beautiful place.\n\nA fresh wind then blew from the sea and our feet guided us\
  \ from a nice square, surrounded by charming restaurants, to a marina, where hundreds\
  \ of white boats were carefully docked. As we walked, the ocean assumed different\
  \ green tones and slowly revealed beaches framed by stones and astonishing clear\
  \ water. Although the cold breeze, I was kissed by the sun and embraced by the ocean.\
  \ In that night, I could not even remember the main purpose of the trip. \n\nOn\
  \ the next day we headed to the South. The buildings gave place to spectacular landscapes:\
  \ the road was bordered by a rugged relief that ended an extraordinary sea. It was\
  \ impossible to define those shades of blue. We were guided by our intuition and\
  \ stopped several times, just to admire that abundant nature. We dive in several\
  \ beaches; in most of them we were completely alone. The feeling of freedom is indescribable.\n\
  \nAt the end of the day, a sign on the road caught our attention. Without internet\
  \ access we decided take a chance. After a few minutes seeing nothing but a narrow\
  \ sand path and glimpses of the sea, a clearing became visible. Suddenly, an overwhelming\
  \ vision hit me: I was standing on a cliff, looking at two beautiful green islands\
  \ in the middle of the ocean. On both sides, another cliffs could be seen, in different\
  \ heights. On their bases, deep blue waves were slowly transformed into a brilliant\
  \ light blue. Everything seemed to be in slow motion. Even the sun, that had just\
  \ started its descendant trajectory, was at a slower pace.\n\nShades of orange and\
  \ pink timidly painted the sky, now being reflected in a golden ocean. By sitting\
  \ at the edge of the rock I got lost in thoughts, hypnotized by the immensity of\
  \ the sea. In an attempt to froze the moment, some photos were taken, but none of\
  \ them could capture that beautiful picture. \n\nIt was about to get dark when we\
  \ decided to leave. In our trail back, we turned our focus to the floor, watching\
  \ our steps. It was only when we reached the car that, as if by instinct, I looked\
  \ up and my heart just stopped. Millions of stars illuminated the sky. No trace\
  \ of the moon could be seen, enhancing the contrast of that starry sky before our\
  \ eyes. As we wiped out our lanterns the scene became even more magical: we could\
  \ see The Milky Way. It was the first time I witnessed that exuberant appearance\
  \ of the stars and I could not contain the tears. With a smile on my face and after\
  \ long sighs, I got into that car with the feeling that Ibiza was certainly the\
  \ most surprising place I had ever visited, and that I found there much more than\
  \ I ever dreamed: I found myself. The place where you are now may not be the one\
  \ you desire or dream about, but rather the place you need to be. I will still return\
  \ to that amazing island in the summer, of course, to enjoy the season. But in my\
  \ heart there is no doubt that no beach party will erase that spectacular autumn\
  \ sunset."
