Text: "\u201CGive me three words. Don\u2019t think. Whatever comes first.\u201D\n\n\
  \u201CWings\u2026wonder\u2026blue.\u201D\n\n     I hesitated, but the words were\
  \ true as they tripped off my tongue. Jo typed his worn out typewriter on the sun-kissed\
  \ streets of Porto. I only had five euro in cash, I told him, but he didn\u2019\
  t seem to care. Jo had a pile of poems, which he encouraged me to look through while\
  \ he crafted something new. I could tell by the spark in his eye he would continue\
  \ to write whether or not the euros came. Like me and music, this sort of shared\
  \ dreaming brought him joy. The poems were beautiful, gateways into a soul at work\
  \ and a mastering of the English language.\n     Jo thought for a minute, and continued\
  \ on his poetical quest to capture my essence, or something. Curly, short dreads\
  \ locked his hair, and for a street poet busking his way around Europe, he kept\
  \ himself pretty well. Hell, I was the one sleeping on a boat the night before,\
  \ I probably seemed (and smelled) more curious to him than he to me. We saw in each\
  \ other a shared struggling artist\u2019s ethos, which united us.\n     I sat and\
  \ read his stacks and after only a few minutes, Jo produced a sheet of paper with\
  \ a poem Cummings or Eliot would have envied. Somehow, without knowing me but a\
  \ moment, Jo King seemed to have captured my innermost feelings at the time, the\
  \ way my heart moved. A long summer donning an important new role at my current\
  \ job, bookending with a sojourn of self discovery, I was \u201Cflying across the\
  \ ether of nothingness with wonder and grace as it flies in blue\u201D. \n    The\
  \ poem ended with cautionary wisdom, \u201CWherever you are the world is full of\
  \ wonder, let your wings take you where the gods sleep.\u201D I was just hoping\
  \ to help out a fellow busker, and perhaps find out how to score some green but\
  \ ended up with a mirror peering into my soul. \n    After some reflection upon\
  \ my new friend\u2019s words, we shot the breeze and he invited me to a gathering\
  \ of like-minded street artists who gather at the top of the city to watch the sun\
  \ fall asleep each evening. That is an opportunity not to be missed, so I agreed\
  \ to join.\n    We parted ways and I wandered up the hills continuing to seek that\
  \ wonder, and after a failed attempt at finding a decently priced francesinha, I\
  \ wandered to the grass on the top of the hill. Jo was right, this was where the\
  \ buskers spent their dusk. As the sun danced, more and more hipped out artists,\
  \ musicians and other locals gathered on the grassy mound above the city. \n   \
  \ Directly beyond, the ocean reflected the pink orange red of the sunset, and I\
  \ joined Jo and his mates to drink one euro beer and sing the sun to sleep. There\u2019\
  s something bonding about saying goodbye to a day with others. Strangers on a hill,\
  \ watching the day turn into night, sharing in that simple but monumental transition.\
  \ A rebirth of sorts. \n    Along the hill, I met others from around the world.\
  \ We sang, we drank, we sat. Together. Fellow journeyers traveling throughout Europe,\
  \ ending up at its furthermost point, basking in the end of summer\u2019s brilliance.\
  \ \n     There\u2019s generosity in a simple invitation. The busking culture exemplifies\
  \ that kindness. Community is built not only through proximity but through an openness,\
  \ however brief. Through his poetry, invite and willingness to share on a Portuguese\
  \ hill, we connected. Jo, an African poet and me, a dumb American. For a brief moment\
  \ making the world a little smaller and a little brighter. \n\n\u201CLooking up\
  \ \nas the sun falls in the sky, \nand my mind races high up- into blue\nMind wearing\
  \ wings of imagination\nFlying into the cosmos\nAs i wonder a bout the stars\nAs\
  \ i contemplate the beauty of the sun\nAnd wings of the mind\nSpread wide across\
  \ reality\u2026\u201D\n\nMy wings took me to where gods sleep and I am better for\
  \ it. Adventure need not always be some grand series of events, but sometimes is\
  \ found in the quiet stillness of a shared sunset."
