Text: "It was an unusual cold September morning when I decided that the call of dreams\
  \ was louder and stronger than the unknown and the warm embraces of the people I\
  \ love. A leap into the unknow. Only two luggages to keep me company and the name\
  \ of a city in the East. Timisoara, also known as the little Vienna. The first city\
  \ to have electricity. The people around me spoke a language I didn't know, the\
  \ streets were unfamilar to me. A grayness that was soon replaced by warm rays of\
  \ sun that settled on proud and ancient buildings, on the paths through the parks\
  \ on the way to the medical school, on the strict and proud people: morally strong,\
  \ full of dignity, tireless workers with the desire to share travel experiences,\
  \ culturally active enough to know three languages at least.\nThe sunlight soon\
  \ settled on the traveling companions, all coming from a different city with their\
  \ own cultural \u201Cbackpack\u201D and habits to mix and adapt inside the classrooms.\
  \ Lost children all the same in homesickness, all the same with different ages and\
  \ different eyes, all the same with different religions traditions and accent, all\
  \ the same with different skin. With the same aim, the hunger to know the differences\
  \ and make it a place of enrichment. A leap into the void that soon translated into\
  \ an international embrace where Romanians, Belgian, Germans, Arabs, Italians, French,\
  \ Spanish, Americans, British, Pakistani, Indians, Greeks opened the doors of their\
  \ homes and sutured every division decided with a geographical scalpel.\nTime was\
  \ punctuated by a sun rising without forgiveness and without shutters: Autumn flooded\
  \ the clean and swept stadia with yellow leaves before the frenzy of the city at\
  \ 7:00 lit up; Winter whitened with thick, knee-high snow; Spring opened the tulips\
  \ in Victory Square, the Roses in the Rosul Parcul, long avenues of trees colored\
  \ with bright pink and white; Summer opened the dances to lantern nights in hay\
  \ stools, fountains and musical creativity. Every detail was taken care of. Every\
  \ rule had to be strictly respected. I will never forget the eyes of every single\
  \ person who, telling me about his city, took me there  without a ticket.\nTwo months\
  \ before I danced in my island in the Mediterranean a choreography entitled \"the\
  \ journey never done\" and after a while I was on that journey, with the same suitcase\
  \ with me on the stage and my camera to immortalize the faces of the elderly never\
  \ tired, of the children who played with pigeons and with the chessboards of a man's\
  \ size, the beauty of the wild and untouchable nature, the disabled women at the\
  \ corners who didn't ask for anything but accepted with a smile, a few people, men\
  \ who with their heads held high looked for something in the dumpsters that should\
  \ not be deprecated.\nI also saw two sides of a medal and I realized that a Romanian\
  \ man can smash your door and beat you and that a Romanian man can help you escape\
  \ from that house helping youand moving  all your belongings away, quickly.\nI saw\
  \ kids having a party and watching the phone waiting for a call from home, hoping\
  \ to solve family problems. I remember the grip of the heart in seeing children\
  \ sniff glue because they could not afford anything else and I remember the grip\
  \ of anger in seeing healthy boys burn a lot of money in drugs.\nThe characteristic\
  \ darting of bicycles became deafening when Tim was run over and died when he was\
  \ only 25 years old.\nAnd even when every day was hard and seemed like a never-ending\
  \ battle, I looked around and whoever was next to me was the mirror of myself. We\
  \ all had the same desire to jump into the unexpected, that wonderful crazy leap\
  \ into the unknow."
