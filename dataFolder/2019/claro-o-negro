Text: "This place carries a charge. \nThe moment I look across four lanes of traffic\
  \ separating the port exit and the square opposite already filling up with tourists\
  \ looking for their groups and guides I feel its surge. Breathing in deeply, I take\
  \ a right, deciding to hug the harbor and follow it\u2019s impressive fortified\
  \ walls.  I have no group, no guide, very little Spanish. I feel glorious. It's\
  \ mid-January, a strong sun hovers above a dry 80 degrees. I have less than five\
  \ hours to see a city I've romanticized ever since Obama told us we could. \nI follow\
  \ the broad Malec\xF3n, smelling the sea-breeze as it volleys between the harbor\
  \ and the sea wall until it ends and brings me to the Plaza de la Revoluci\xF3n,\
  \ a desolate, concrete expanse where Castro would chain smoke cigars and speak for\
  \ hours next to a mid-century monument to man.\nI have spent the last three days\
  \ cooped up with my mother and a younger brother in a room too small for all of\
  \ our angst and egos. I stop for coffee at an iron table in yet another square trimmed\
  \ with pastel buildings full of wooden etchings, crumbling plaster and rickety iron\
  \ balconies. I have one strong coffee with sugar, then another and mull over my\
  \ individuality, my apparent inability to talk to anyone anymore without exasperation\
  \ and annoyance. I had hoped that I was just overworked and under stimulated, I\
  \ had placed great hopes on this trip, a chance to bond with a family I seemed to\
  \ like and understand in fits. It hasn\u2019t worked. I feel a loner after all,\
  \ all I need are some headphones and a new set of streets.\nThree men a table away\
  \ from me kept badgering the fourth about something, I understand none of the words,\
  \ only the quick cadence of the sentences directed at him, and his defeatist sighs\
  \ in answer.\nThen, \u201Cclaro o negro?\u201D\nThe words pierced my introspection,\
  \ I jerked my head in their direction. These words I knew.  By the way the man\u2019\
  s three companions paused, grinned and visibly relaxed I knew I was right, he was\
  \ referencing beer. I\u2019m a dedicated drinker, I could not leave Havana without\
  \ quenching the thirst I just now realized I had. I folded a few bills under my\
  \ empty coffee cup, stubbed out my cigarette and waited. I was incapable of summoning\
  \ courage or words to ask them where this Cuban beer might be found, so I become\
  \ James Bond, waiting for my target to move. Roughly twenty minutes pass before\
  \ the men get up and I hoped, star towards a bar. I nonchalantly follow them. Their\
  \ gate is easy, their conversation light now, they\u2019re in no hurry, the setting\
  \ sun frames the start of their night. I adopt the same rhythm, and them as my unwitting\
  \ guides, pocket my headphones, and as they chatter on ahead of me I begin to look\
  \ at the growing number of women looking down from second and third floor balconies\
  \ flanked by lines of hanging laundry. Kids and music are ubiquitous now, the former\
  \ playing some scaled down, street versions of baseball, the later wafts from every\
  \ door. I notice we have left the larger squares behind, the streets have narrowed\
  \ and the cafes and tables disappeared. We couldn\u2019t have walked for more than\
  \ 30 minutes but there wasn\u2019t a retro taxi in sight.\nI almost walked right\
  \ by them. My guides had stopped at a window of a venta libre. I heard them ask\
  \ for Caciques, light and crips in their glasses. I walked up after them and asked\
  \ for a Bucanero, this was the dark brew I like, the negro. The men sat down on\
  \ a wide stone bench while a small pack of dogs trotted by on some business or other.\
  \ I spot a low stone wall, take my bottle and nest myself atop of it. I have no\
  \ idea where I am, or if I could GoogleMap myself back, but the sun is low and hazy,\
  \ the music rhythmic, my beer delicious, I felt the peace that had alluded me, I\
  \ toast my guides and close my eyes with joy."
