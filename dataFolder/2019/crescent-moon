Text: "It was my first travel, I have never been in a plane before and the plane would\
  \ take nine hours till destination. Rome.\nSince when I started planned the trip,\
  \ two things always came in my mind: the fear of plane and how this moment was expected\
  \ by me for my whole life.\nMy parents could not afford a travel, and daydreaming\
  \ used to be the only way that I could know all the places that I wanted. \nOn the\
  \ travel's day, my parents took me into the airport, and whit tears in their eyes,\
  \ they hugged me. My mom words watching me going to the plane was \"Fly, honey,\
  \ you was born to fly\".\nThese words made all the fear go away.\nI slept during\
  \ almost all the flight, but in a certain moment in the night I woke up. We were\
  \ flying somewhere above the Mediterranean Sea, and the phrase \"open the window\"\
  \ was repeating on my mind.\nI confess that the thought of all the darkness out\
  \ there the plane and the complete empty were not something that I was anxious to\
  \ experience.\nI look around the plane and - except by a mom feeding her baby -\
  \ everybody was sleeping.\nSilence dominated the plane, but not my mind.\nThose\
  \ words were still there, screaming with me \"OPEN THE WINDOW!\".\nSo a opened.\n\
  And what I saw made me shed tears - a lot!\nThere, out of the window, surrounded\
  \ by darkness, was the moon in its crescent phase. The same way that is tattoed\
  \ in me.\nWhen I decided to make a moon' tattoo I was going through a tough moment\
  \ marked by the nights that I could not sleep and the moon was my only company and\
  \ confidente. I can really say that the moon was my best friend for a long time.\n\
  I watched her changing night by night, and during our shared nights I was teached\
  \ that all in life was just phase.\nAnd above the Mediterranean Sea my old friend\
  \ wanted to show me how beautiful and magician life could be if we decide to open\
  \ windows.\nI don't know how long I spent seeing the moon and thinking about the\
  \ nights that was just her and me, but when I realized I was watching the sunlight\
  \ indicating that the day was starting in somewhere. The moon, the sun and me. Took\
  \ a photo to eternalize this moment but deep down I kwen that it was already eternalized\
  \ in me.\nThat was the moment that I connected to myself and realized that no matter\
  \ where I go, my place is not some fixed city, state or country, but in the sky,\
  \ flying (as my mom said) surrounded by the moon, the stars and the sun, going to\
  \ everywhere when I can experience new phases in a search for happiness."
