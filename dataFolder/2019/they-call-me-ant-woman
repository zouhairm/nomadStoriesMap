Text: "\u201CCopia, copia, copia!\u201D\nWhen I think back on my time in the rainforest,\
  \ I\u2019m reminded of that litany of words crackling over portable radios. The\
  \ trip was meant to push me outside my comfort zone. Little did I know that the\
  \ Peruvian jungle would capture my heart and ruin everyday life forever. \n\nOur\
  \ international troop of travelers traipsed down the dark, muddy trail. The gentle\
  \ rain and almost unpleasant humidity heightened the sense of adventure. Our flashlights\
  \ pointed in all directions, looking for any and every sign of night wildlife. The\
  \ explorer guide suddenly stopped and shined his light on a nearby leaf. \u201C\
  This is a bullet ant. Very bad. Very poisonous. It feels like you are shot by a\
  \ bullet when it bites you.\u201D \n\nThe size and appearance of the ant did not\
  \ intimidate as much as its reputation. I made a mental note to avoid all interactions\
  \ with this jungle bully and continued merrily on my way. \n\nSafely back in my\
  \ cabana, I was overcome by the day. The red howler monkeys residing in the neighboring\
  \ tree had served as my alarm clock that morning. Throughout the day, blue and gold\
  \ macaws shared airtime with the larger, pheasant-looking hoatzin. All of this was\
  \ audible through screen walls supporting the roof of my hut. At night, a look through\
  \ those same walls afforded a view of citronella lamp lit pathways curving off into\
  \ the distance. \n\nI reached into my bag and excruciating pain met my outstretched\
  \ hand. I looked down to see an ant scurry out of my formerly trustworthy hiking\
  \ backpack. Everything froze. All I could think was, \u201CVery bad. Very poisonous.\u201D\
  \ I snapped back to reality realizing that I needed to act quickly and show the\
  \ offending insect to a knowledgeable source. In my efforts to capture the ant,\
  \ it bit me again. \u201CDOUBLE DEATH!\u201D I thought. \n\nI hesitated momentarily,\
  \ embarrassed by the idea of explaining how I had chased down a poisonous insect\
  \ armed with only a tissue. \n\nMy mind raced as I ran to the main house.\n\u201C\
  Well, I\u2019m glad that I purchased that travel insurance. It sure is a shame to\
  \ die now. I was so close to that credit score of 800.\u201D I had visions of myself\
  \ stumbling through the rainforest to the river, boating back to Puerto Maldonado\
  \ and chartering a flight to Lima in the middle of the night. \n\nThe horrified\
  \ lodge attendant foiled my attempt at an inconspicuous entry once I showed her\
  \ the tissue-and-bullet-ant tangle in my now swollen, red hand. \n\u201CCopia, copia,\
  \ copia!\u201D \nAssistance was summoned to the main house. There was additional\
  \ back and forth on the radios, but my intermediate-at-best Spanish skills couldn\u2019\
  t keep up. One of the jungle guides told me \u201CDrop it!\u201D as another unceremoniously\
  \ stomped on the ant and dragged it across the floor. \n\nThe lodge manager arrived\
  \ with an anti-histamine pill and cream. The ant-stomping guide then described what\
  \ would happen. \u201CPain will travel up your arm and take over the side of your\
  \ body. You will get a fever and a headache.\u201D \n\u201CAm I going to die?\u201D\
  \n\u201CNo\u2026 you should be fine.\u201D \n\nThey gave me a whistle and told me\
  \ to blow the whistle in the night if I needed help. \n\nIt was not easy to then\
  \ composedly eat a three-course meal as it felt like someone was holding a blowtorch\
  \ to my hand. The muscles in my arm twitched uncontrollably. Fellow guests tried\
  \ not to stare at me, the solo female traveler sitting in the corner holding her\
  \ cream lathered hand in the air as she tried to cut quinoa crusted fish with her\
  \ other hand. \n\nThe lodge manager found me the next day. \u201CWe were worried\
  \ about you. We had extra security patrolling by your cabana listening for your\
  \ whistle. You\u2019re our first bite.\u201D \n\nMy parting conversation with the\
  \ night walk guide proved to be equally as rewarding. \u201CI heard you were bitten\
  \ by a bullet ant. How many times?\u201D I told him twice. I neglected to tell him\
  \ that the second bite was self-inflicted. \u201CTwo times! And you didn\u2019t\
  \ go to the hospital! You are a strong woman. Now you have super powers. Now you\
  \ are Ant Woman.\u201D"
