Text: "The first time I visted the USA I was only 16. While I was in highschool, me\
  \ and four more of my classmates won an US Government scholarship to participate\
  \ on a summer course that would change our lifes forever. This program was searching\
  \ for mexican teeangers who were interested in applying a social project in their\
  \ communities. Only 17 teams from all around Mexico were selected to participate\
  \  with different projects. Ours: avoiding school drop-out.\n\nI had never been\
  \ on airplane before, neither on abroad. Even when Mexico and the USA know a lot\
  \ about each other,  I knew that what I was about to live would be something completely\
  \ different. \n\nWe flew from Mexico City to New York. A 6-hours turbulent flght\
  \ felt like an eternity for someone who was traveling by airplane for the first\
  \ time. Once we landed we took a bus to Brattleboro, Vermont where we will spend\
  \ the first week of our one-month course. That night was freezing and also rainning.\
  \ They gave us our dorm and we only got to sleep 4 hours that night. \n\nThe campus\
  \ of the SIT of World Learning became our new home. We were sharing the dorms with\
  \ people from all around the world and we had the amazing opprtunity to share our\
  \ cultures during that week. We got a wiser perspective of how the world could be\
  \ seen by others and we developed some new leadership skills that wouldn't have\
  \ happened if we weren't in a context like that. I challenged my self that week,\
  \ faced my biggest fears and I grew up. I connected with a root of me that I didn\xB4\
  t know for that time. I just got to knew me better. \n\nThe next week we left Vermont.\
  \ It was difficult, but I never thought that what was comming was beyond better.\
  \ We arrived to Baltimore, Maryland in the afternoon. It was hotter than Brattleboro\
  \ and also more challenging. We lived for two weeks with a hosting family. It was\
  \ difficult to get used to the dynamic of this family, but also was one of the richest\
  \ experiencies we had during the program. Due to that, we got to know better the\
  \ american culture and they made us feel part of it. The bounds we created were\
  \ fundamental to embrace all the new learning of different organizations that showed\
  \ us the way they worked to achieve their objectives. The empowerment we received\
  \ those days was key to acomplish our goals. \n\nFinally, Washington D.C. The greatness\
  \ of that city was whitness of the end of that summer. We finished planning our\
  \ projects and it was time to say goodbye between all the monuments. It seemed like\
  \ we were leaving in the US a big part of ourselves there, but the truth was that\
  \ we would keep the memories, the knowledge, the friendships and our youth forever."
