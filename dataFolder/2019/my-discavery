Text: "Armenia is a country  with the thousand-year history and  culture, the country\
  \ I dreamed of visiting, surprised and delighted me with its hospitality, beautiful\
  \ nature, pleasant people, very delicious original cuisine and a lot of sights both\
  \ historically and architecturally important  valuable and interesting. I was delighted\
  \ with my trip to Armenia. I flew to Yerevan and on that day I spent  in the capital\
  \ studying the local life, cuisine and  sights of the city before  going out  for\
  \ a walk around the city  and going to museums  i ordered a car  with the guide\
  \ -driver  in the hotel  to see the surroundings the next day . \n   Erebuni museum\
  \ - it is a first place what i visited in Yerevan . The first  place what i wanted\
  \ to see in Yerevan  is the Erebuni museum . Erebuni  is an ancient  city of the\
  \ state Urartu. This ancient  fort was built by the king of Urartu as a supporting\
  \  point as anchoring  the Urartians in the Ararat valley  and the  city that was\
  \ build before our era. As it is very historical and  architecturally  significant\
  \  object  in the history of mankind and for me too . I got great pleasure  after\
  \ visiting and feeling energy  of this place . I also visited Ancient Manuscripts\
  \ Museum, the National Historical Museum of Armenia and the day ended with listening\
  \  to pleasant classical music at the  Yerevan Opera House .\n All the following\
  \ days were  also amazing. At the second  things that amazed me was the view of\
  \ the  snow-white cap of  Mount Ararat, tourists rarely to see the mountain because\
  \ it is always in a haze of clouds. Lake Sevan is a very beautiful place, Geghard\
  \ monastery, Khor- Virap monastery, Noravank, Garni Temple, Sevanavank Temple, Zvartnotz\
  \ Temple, Novanavank, Odzun  monastery -every  monastery and temple hast its own\
  \ history and  legends. \nTatev this  an amazing place. That monastery was not only\
  \ a religious  church  but also  represented  one of the most  important centers\
  \  of science und education  of medieval Armenia.\nI think  Armenia will not leave\
  \ anyone indifferent. \n\nP.S.. Each my  journey gives me a lot of new information,\
  \ pleasure and I leave a small  piece of my heart in every country  wherever I am\
  \ ."
