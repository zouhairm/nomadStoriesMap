Text: "I had never experienced such a mixture of emotions in any of my travels. The\
  \ turquoise blue of the lake glistened under the Sun. At every fold of the waves,\
  \ the water tips shimmered like crystals. The beige rock slopes holding the water\
  \ body in place seemed to be dancing to their own tune, gliding to either sides\
  \ as our boat moved across the lake. My eyes could register every minute detail\
  \ of the beauty that had us surrounded from all sides, my skin could anticipate\
  \ the touch of the water and the rocks nearby, and my body could sense the lightness\
  \ that the crisp air brought to it, but my heart remained unsettled. \nThere were\
  \ eight of us, travelling through Gilgit and Baltistan in the northern parts of\
  \ Pakistan on a Green 1990s Pajero.  Nine of us got onto the boat that day, part\
  \ excited part anxious. It was a twenty minute long boat ride and yet in my memory\
  \ it has been stretched between moments and emotions, lasting to this very day.\
  \ Part of me wished that the lake was just beautiful, simply beautiful and that\
  \ I could admire it for its simple beauty alone. \nAs our boat parted the water\
  \ surface, leading us farther away from the shore, into the layers of mountain peaks,\
  \ embracing the lake from all sides, I couldn\u2019t keep myself from staring at\
  \ the water surface, hoping to find something buried underneath. But to my apparent\
  \ dismay, all I could rest my eyes on, was the splendor of the lake. All of us were\
  \ taking photos, making videos, making sure we would never forget what we were experiencing.\
  \ My mind kept going back to a single thought: our celebration today would not be\
  \ possible had it not been for a tragedy five years ago. \nAttabad Lake was formed\
  \ as a result of a natural disaster in 2010. A landslide blocked the passage for\
  \ River Hunza resulting in a lake formation that buried villages and farmland sitting\
  \ deep inside the valley and taking the lives of 20 residents while displacing another\
  \ 6000 and swallowing the local highway. Consequently, everything from people to\
  \ cargo to vehicles had to be transported on barges to the other side of the Hunza\
  \ Valley until new infrastructure was constructed to replace the old one. \nWe floated\
  \ over the lake and with it the misfortune buried underneath. I would admire the\
  \ lake and the scenery around me and immediately get reminded of the disaster that\
  \ caused it. One of my friends, travelling with us was a local of Hunza, I asked\
  \ him about the lake, hoping with all my heart that his answers will lessen the\
  \ blow of realization that kept hitting me over and over again. I asked whether\
  \ people received a warning beforehand, did they get enough time to evacuate, to\
  \ which he replied, \u201CSome stayed back in the hope that it wouldn\u2019t happen\
  \ and eventually unable to evacuate on time\u201D \u2013 unable to comprehend how\
  \ the land that they called their own could betray them like that. \nI had nothing\
  \ more to ask. It was as though I realized that there was no escaping this contradiction\
  \ in my feelings. As we approached the other end of the lake, the last thread keeping\
  \ my sentiments in place, snapped. Tree Tops. The tree tops that were once too high\
  \ to reach, struggled to stay above the water, as though gasping for air. \u201C\
  The lake is definitely unforgiving\u201D, I thought. For the rest of the boat ride,\
  \ I just sat silently trying to make sense of the war waging inside my heart. The\
  \ crew maneuvered the boat through the tree tops and onto the shore. \nEight of\
  \ us got out of the boat and while the crew unloaded the ninth one, I walked over\
  \ to the edge of the lake, took one last look to breathe it all in, with my eyes\
  \ and with my heart, the calamity that bore all that magnificence."
