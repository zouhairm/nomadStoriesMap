Text: "I spent one year in Africa for work and it was one of the best year of my life.\
  \ When I first arrived in Libreville the locals thought I was Gabonese so right\
  \ there I felt comfortable and super excited for my one year over there. In my time\
  \ there I saw the most beautiful places and also majestic views. I spent time on\
  \ a seismic vessel doing research and I was so surprised and excited to see the\
  \ things I saw. I saw whales, dolphins and even sharks in their natural habitat.\
  \ Also brushed up on my French as well so I could at least engage in conversations\
  \ with the locals. Towards the end of my journey in Gabon \U0001F1EC\U0001F1E6 I\
  \ got sick \U0001F915 on my way home. I told my mother and she\u2019s immediately\
  \ thought I had Ebola because I just got back from Africa so she made the assumption.\
  \ Well that freaked me out a bit so I went to urgent care and the nurses went through\
  \ their procotol of questions. And they told me they couldn\u2019t treat me because\
  \ I was in Africa and that I needed to go to the emergency room, so I went to a\
  \ hospital in Mesa, AZ and went through the same protocol but this time they evacuated\
  \ the entire ER put me in a wheelchair like I couldn\u2019t walk myself. They wheeled\
  \ me in room with all of the doctors and nurses wearing hazmat outfits on and quarantine\
  \ me in a room for a day just for them to tell me I only had the stomachs virus.\
  \ I got a bill for $3,000 in medical bills lol but overall my journey was bitter\
  \ sweet. And if you would ask me if I would do it again? I would say just well not\
  \ the Ebola portion."
