Text: "As a child I loved travelling through tunnels. I would sit in the back seat\
  \ of the car, the dim road lighting would flash by at a million miles an hour, and\
  \ I would just sit there staring out the window, hypnotised by the flicker. The\
  \ idea that you leave one place and arrive somewhere completely new has always amazed\
  \ me.\nToday as I passed through a tunnel on the way to A Coruna and I tried to\
  \ untangle what happened over the last 30 days of walking 900km across spain. \n\
  Throughout the camino I have been fortunate enough to witness the natural beauty\
  \ of transitioning landscapes, take meaning from my shadow as the day evolved. My\
  \ mind would dance with wonder, looking up at the stars as I took full advantage\
  \ of the leftover pilgrim wine. But beyond trying to become more present in my surroundings,\
  \ I also spent many days deep in thought, sometimes quite confronting. Its been\
  \ an amazing journey, starting off in st jean, long stretches of nothingness, which\
  \ allowed me to come to terms with things I always knew but had never taken time\
  \ to explore. I know for sure that the people on the camino were the biggest factors\
  \ in shaping my experience and ensured that the light at the end of the tunnel was\
  \ as bright and beautiful as a morning  sunrise. So thank you all and buen camino."
