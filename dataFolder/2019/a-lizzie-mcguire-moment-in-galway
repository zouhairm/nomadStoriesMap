Text: "Outfit-repeating, falling over things that aren't there, pulling the curtains\
  \ down during graduation. Where is Lizzie McGuire now? Who knows, but her Australian\
  \ cousin is right here.\n\nThere I was, about to begin my first real solo overseas\
  \ trip, a matured twenty-two year old ready to take on all the men with sexy accents,\
  \ I mean, everything the UK & Ireland could throw at her. I was about to begin a\
  \ life-changing journey, right? And was I going to let my extra long and un-coordinated\
  \ limbs get in the way? You betcha. I digress, the clumsy show must go on.\n\nI\
  \ had been dreaming about the rolling green hills of Ireland ever since my first\
  \ screening of P.S I Love You at age twelve. Nothing, not even Gerard Butler\u2019\
  s questionable Irish accent, was going to stop me.\n\nDuring my Galway stay I met\
  \ an intriguing man at my hostel. Let\u2019s call him John. He looked like the mysterious\
  \ writer type. He dressed well, and spoke politely. The kind of man you know your\
  \ mum would love. And just when I would doubt my feelings for this curious man,\
  \ he would quote Ernest Hemingway, or discuss politics of The Troubles in Ireland\
  \ during the 70s with me.  Like, who did this guy think he was? I was confused.\
  \ Flustered. And a little hooked. The disappointing part of the story: John was\
  \ also Australian. Goodbye Irish husband. Oh well, there\u2019s always my next visit.\n\
  \nOne absolutely freezing cold evening, everyone at the hostel decided it was time\
  \ to have a respectful drink or two down at Monroe\u2019s *cough cough*. This is\
  \ where John told me he was in the Navy. A navy man. A tall, whisky drinking, navy\
  \ man. Thank you, universe. \nFour pints of Guinness, two tequila shots and one\
  \ Margarita later, I knew it was time to turn this confusing platonic friendship\
  \ into something a little more. \n\nI was struck with a  brilliant idea.\n\n*Please\
  \ prepare for the dumbest idea you have ever heard (that next to anything that has\
  \ ever come out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth):\n\nI saw John walk towards where\
  \ we were all sitting. My brain thought it would be a good idea to \u2018accidentally\u2019\
  \ bump into him - in a cute way of course - I would apologise, and he would sit\
  \ down next to me. I would then be able to \u201Cput out the vibe\u201D. But after\
  \ you have about 4 pints of Guinness, two tequila shots and one Margarita, one\u2019\
  s depth perception and awareness isn't as clear as one would think. Shocking, I\
  \ know. And what I had failed to see was John carrying a Baby Guinness shot in each\
  \ hand. \n\nWith Troy Bolton singing \u201CNow or Never\u201D in my head - I stood\
  \ up, walked quickly in John\u2019s direction, with an outreached hand I tapped\
  \ him on the shoulder, he turned swiftly to face me, I failed to stop my feet from\
  \ walking, and smashed into his chest. John dropped both of his shots, and the tiny\
  \ glasses shattered as soon as they hit the ground. And as I have a habit of tripping\
  \ on things that aren't there, I fell backwards right onto my buttocks. There we\
  \ were both covered in sticky, milky alcohol *hehe* I am so cute. After he helped\
  \ me off the ground, and I dusted off whatever integrity I had left, I went up to\
  \ the bar to buy John two new shots. And afterwards do you know where he sat? Right\
  \ next to me. Ah, ha! My plan all along\u2026\n\n\nIt is at 4.00am after a night\
  \ of consuming six different types of liquor, that I always make my best decisions.\
  \ So when we exited the pub, John gave me the classic \u201Cwanna get out of here\u201D\
  \ line, without a beat I gave him a wink and took his hand. I\u2019m the biggest\
  \ sucker for a movie moment. Maybe my love for the Lizzie McGuire movie has made\
  \ me that way. But nights like these don't happen to girls from rural Victoria.\
  \ Yet there I was in the middle of a road in Galway, covered in Baby Guinness, snogging\
  \ a sexy Navy man."
