Text: "The Most Common Word At The 21 th century is \"Creativity\" But Have you ever\
  \ asked yourself when did this word started to be used? \nOkay, now you're confused\
  \ I know. \nSo, I will give you the answer, Linguistically it appeared newly , Practically\
  \ we could see the light of creativity 7000 years ago, At the age of the Ancient\
  \ Egyptians. Pick A Map at look with me at the south of Egypt you will find a small\
  \ Heaven Called \"Aswan\".\nFrom the first second my feet made noise on Its floor\
  \ The Aswanies welcomed me with their soft smiles which makes your heart beats warmer,\
  \ Because of these Smiles I left my heart there, where Its right place to be. \n\
  After that hot welcoming you will find A Volunteer of the Aswanies wants to guide\
  \ you around the town even if you don't need to hire a guide but they want to protect\
  \ you from your mindless when you see any small detail at the streets without the\
  \ desire of going to the hotel. \nYkue Aswanie will guide you the place where the\
  \ creativity was created. \nBy your first steps at \"fila temple \" you will have\
  \ the desire to put black \"Kohl\" on your eyes like ancient Queens and Kings to\
  \ trick your mind of being like them. \nAfter sinking in all of these details of\
  \ \"fila\" , when it is time to go you will be sad a little bit because you will\
  \ cannot see that beauty 20 seconds more. \nThen, the Nile Trip comes To integrate\
  \ your wounds even with No Scars. \nAt Aswan there is no time to be sad even when\
  \ the Aswanies As Human Beings Feels Sad when they feel it they Dance on MOUNIR'S\
  \ songs! \nSo if you think that you're creative go to Aswan and try to create like\
  \ an ancient and if you could do it on their way CALL Me!  \nI will be waiting for\
  \ your call And I know that I will wait for the rest of my life. \n\"If you want\
  \ to call me, Go to Aswan first\""
