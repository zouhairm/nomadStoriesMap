Text: "Healing, growing and evolving. My story is centred around the subject of female\
  \ empowerment through past experiences of traveling alone.\n\nAs a New Zealander\
  \ born in a small quiet town (Dunedin) I embarked over to London in 2017 on a two\
  \ year youth visa with my partner. Truth be told, at that point in my life, I left\
  \ my home country in bad shape emotionally. In essence I was a heart broken, confused\
  \ and unhappy person.\n\nIn London, my partner and I both held jobs where at times\
  \ we were both granted time off at different periods. Although scared and a little\
  \ hesitant, I took the opportunity to travel alone, to see, experience and leap\
  \ into the unknown...\n\"Aren't you worried about going to a country like Czech\
  \ as a woman alone?\" They said..  \"I can't imagine you going on treks in your\
  \ heels!\" They laughed.\n\nAnd off I went. What I didn't expect to find was how\
  \ liberating it was to travel alone with (at times) nothing but a few bucks in my\
  \ pocket to spend. As a model and living in a somewhat material world at times I\
  \ felt myself growing, evolving into a new person through independence, appreciation\
  \ of the beautiful things in life that do not cost a dime and reconnecting with\
  \ my inner soul. I was then able to reflect upon personal past experiences in a\
  \ new, mature light. I started to see the world differently, in an entirely new\
  \ perspective. I grew and I grew, powerful and strong.\n\nI wish to focus my story\
  \ further on my own personal life overcoming obstacles as a female through the rewards\
  \ of travel.  I would love to put this to pen and paper and if given the chance\
  \ to go to Portgual input this into my writing while focusing on the culture, history\
  \ and heart of Portual from the perspective of a woman.\n\n\nI feel this opportunity\
  \ is exactly what I need to really give me that push to transform my past experiences\
  \ of travel into something wonderful to help educate and inspire others, especially\
  \ women . I am aged 30, a university scholarship graduate in Design and Business\
  \ Management and a commercial model. I would be absolutely ecstatic to be awarded\
  \ this opportunity. \n\nThank you for considering my application\n\nBecky"
