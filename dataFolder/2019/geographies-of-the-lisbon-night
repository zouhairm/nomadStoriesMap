Text: "Nightlife in Lisbon has a late schedule. An unaware tourist who goes to Bairro\
  \ Alto for a beer before midnight will find nothing but empty closed bars.  Yet,\
  \ after midnight, the night changes in several places, especially in the central\
  \ areas: Bairro Alto, Cais do Sodr\xE9 e Santos. The city\u2019s nightlife has gained\
  \ a special highlight after the tourism encouragement policy, the arrival of many\
  \ foreign students and the commodification of the night.\n\nIndeed, urban night\
  \ has a big role in the Strategic Plan for Tourism in the Lisbon Region. The capital\
  \ follows the path of other governments efforts to include cities in the main international\
  \ tourist\u2019s destinations. A study promoted by Aicep Portugal has shown that\
  \ Portugal gained \u20AC12,7 billion in 2016 with tourism, the equivalent of 16%\
  \ of the Portuguese export of goods and services.\n\nThe LxNights Principal Investigator,\
  \ Jordi Nofre, said that Lisbon\u2019s night has been recreated since the big recession\
  \ suffered by the country.  \u201CIn 2011, one day before Portugal\u2019s Bailout\
  \ Plan announcement, Bairro Alto was full. One day after, empty. The place remained\
  \ empty for 3 years. The recession made a big impact. Now people are coming back\u201D\
  .\n\nBesides the country\u2019s economic recovery and the growth of tourism, also\
  \ the street drinking culture, the Mediterranean weather, the late hours and the\
  \ cheap drinks help to warm Lisbon\u2019s nightlife. Moreover, a JLL study and data\
  \ indicates that in 2015 and 2016, 11% of Portugal\u2019s student population was\
  \ a foreigner - almost 37 thousand of students, 42% of those just in Lisbon. We\
  \ asked for 10 Erasmus students why they chose Lisbon to live: little was said about\
  \ the University. The most common answers were: \u201Cwell, it is Lisbon!\u201D\
  ;  \u201C(\u2026) and there is the weather\u201D and \u201Cthe nightlife is amazing\u201D\
  . \n\nLisbon\u2019s nightlife biggest particularity is that people are used not\
  \ only to drink on the streets but to walk \u2013 a lot \u2013 among the numerous\
  \ bars and nightclubs. According to the Spanish Erasmus student, Elias Ruas, groups\
  \ walk because the city is safe, the weather is good and it automatically turns\
  \ to be a mandatory activity if you want to keep drinking, as each place has a special\
  \ closing time. \n\nBairro Alto, the highest point for night leisure closes its\
  \ doors at 3 a.m., while Santos and Cais close it between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. Furthermore,\
  \ many people who live in places where the night buses don\u2019t cover, eventually\
  \ stay drinking on the streets waiting for the Subway\u2019s opening time.\n\nThere\
  \ is also functional expertise of the several nightlife areas in Lisbon, which makes\
  \ groups walk among them in order to experience a full night in Lisbon. Mouraria\
  \ and Intendente are open places, hipsters, sought mainly by immigrants. The ones\
  \ who prefer a commercialized night go to Bairro, where it is possible to find everything.\
  \ Private clubs are in Cais or Santos.\n\n\u201CThere are several paths that, later\
  \ in the night, lead to Bairro\u201D, said Nofre. The flow of people walking during\
  \ the night is so high that some residents complain that their buildings \u201C\
  shake\u201D during the movement.\n\nWhen the doors of Bairro close, many decide\
  \ to go down to Cais do Sodr\xE9 and Santos to continue the night. The Bars of Cais\
  \ include, in particular, the surroundings of Rua Rosa, a street painted in Pink\
  \ that gather the local nightlife. \u201CThe place has gone through a process of\
  \ socio-economic revitalization, which opened up the social differences between\
  \ the users and produced micro-temporal gentrification, which manifests itself only\
  \ at night\u201D, said Nofre.\n\nWith such a large number of people backed by their\
  \ respective drinks, it is certain that the urban night raises issues for the residents.\
  \ The \u201CPeople Live Here\u201D \u2013 in Portuguese \u201CAqui mora gente\u201D\
  \ \u2013 campaign tries to tackle the problems of trash, noise, urine and urban\
  \ degradation that people can cause when having fun at night. At the official website\
  \ of the project, there are templates on how to produce a formal complaint to the\
  \ city camera and even applications that measure the noise generated to verify if\
  \ it complies with the law."
