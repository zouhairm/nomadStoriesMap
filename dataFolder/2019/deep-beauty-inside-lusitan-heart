Text: "One time I decided to keep my mind open to the signs. Traveling helps you with\
  \ the concept of being aware of yourself,your surroundings and your inner self ,much\
  \ more if you are in a magic place .\nA magic place is when you go to the soul of\
  \ the food,the inner energy is within the reunion of all the ingredients of the\
  \ food, then the recipe would be a magic potion .\nI have tried a lot of magic potions\
  \ , A lot of meals cooked with garlic are my favorite,all those who have a Mediterranean\
  \ soul,rich in oils like olive oil with its beautiful gold enchantment ,fulfilling\
  \ with gold everything touched...tomatoes have other red print that leads you to\
  \ the heart of the earth ,your own heart or the heart of the chef that is giving\
  \ you the gift of mixing different souls to create a living dream to be tasted...let\u2019\
  s keep dreaming flying around the place where all these souls are from , places\
  \ like Portugal have a lot of energy to share with their visitors. The golden of\
  \ the land is reflected in the colour ,texture and richness of the Portuguese olive\
  \ oil...by itself a dream already ...what about walking there and keep opening new\
  \ treasures to be discovered?\nWhat would happen if you dream near the beach? What\
  \ other dreams are there??\nLet\u2019s begin resting in a good hotel,meditating\
  \ in a nice restaurant and making miracles after eating a heavenly dessert. Lets\u2019\
  s Enjoy the pleasure of Portugal .\u2764\uFE0F"
