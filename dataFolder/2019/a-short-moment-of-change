Text: "Anxiety has been a constant companion through all my life. As such, the shivering\
  \ of my body and cold sweat down my back were nothing new as I walked towards the\
  \ boarding gate on my way from S\xE3o Paulo to Seoul, South Korea. Trying to keep\
  \ my shallow breaths under control, I settle down for the next 16 hours.\n\tMy decision\
  \ to visit the Asian country on my mid-year vacation was made on impulse. The temptation\
  \ of good ticket prices and my curiosity was too strong. As soon as I finished the\
  \ purchase, the cold fear took control. My usual approach to that is to study. Try\
  \ to learn all I can. Be ready for all possibilities.\n\tI had a little over three\
  \ months to get ready. I watched countless hours of YouTube tips. Learned how to\
  \ read hangul, the Korean alphabet. Basic sentences. Worked really hard to learn\
  \ all the ways I could apologize. Tried to understand which cultural faux pas I\
  \ was more likely to commit. Research the best routes to and from my accomodations.\
  \ Took careful inventory of everything I was packing, making sure it was weather\
  \ appropriate. I followed all the instructions to be ready.\nAnd yet, by the time\
  \ I was walking out into the air conditioned lobby of Incheon Airport, I felt anything\
  \ but ready. I was terrified. The anxiety seemed to have fed through the long flight.\
  \ I felt like an unwelcome trouble. My brain kept telling I shouldn\u2019t be there.\
  \ After thousands of dollars in expenses and over a day in transit, however, there\
  \ wasn\u2019t much I could do to change it. \nThe feeling of being an invader slowly\
  \ faded along with my jet lag, but I still couldn\u2019t stay comfortable in my\
  \ own tourist like skin. I visited countless incredible places. Ate lots of delicious\
  \ food. Struggled to read the hangul fast enough so I wouldn\u2019t miss my bus\
  \ stop. All the while, still feeling wrong in a way. Bothersome.\nIt was half way\
  \ into my trip that this changed. Using some well practiced words, I ordered food\
  \ at a booth at Jamshil subway station. Enjoying the spicy tteokbokki, I wasn\u2019\
  t ready for the gentle curious questions made by the owner. I panicked and any trace\
  \ of polite Korean words vanished from my mind, I rudely stared at her, somehow\
  \ conveying my total confusion. As my face turned as red as the sauce, a small voice\
  \ caught my attention. A young boy, no older than 10 years old, whispered \u201C\
  she wants to know where you come from\u201D. He looked very intimidated, and yet,\
  \ he had the courage to talk to this strange, foreign woman with purple hair. \n\
  Looking at this sweet kid and accepting the bowl of fish soup his mother offered\
  \ me, it\u2019s like the nagging feeling that bothered me for so long was caught\
  \ off guard. It was hard for me to realize that not only I wasn\u2019t a bother,\
  \ but that there were people around who wished to make me feel comfortable. A huge\
  \ weight I didn\u2019t notice had flown in with me was lifted. Less worried about\
  \ being perfect, but in making great memories, I struggled to use my poor Korean\
  \ to communicate with the imo at the shop. In response, my young friend helped me\
  \ with English.\nI never got the chance to ask for the name of this child, but he\
  \ and his mother were a turning point for this anxious traveller. Our encounter\
  \ was fleeting. Not even 10 minutes in total. Yet, they were some of the most important\
  \ people in my life for those 18 challenging days. From that point on, I changed\
  \ my perspective on this trip \u2014  hopefully to take this viewpoint longer in\
  \ life. It wasn\u2019t a stupid impulse decision, but an incredible chance to grow.\
  \ And growing is what I did. I collected experiences and companionship. Made a fool\
  \ of myself more than once, and in exchange had people making sure I didn\u2019\
  t feel bad.\nTo my dear helping kid and his mother, as well as to all the people\
  \ who make sure foreigners don\u2019t feel like invaders I say: thank you very much."
