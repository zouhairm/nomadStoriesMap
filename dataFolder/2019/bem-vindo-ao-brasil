Text: "I manage to get lucky to travel to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro to be exact, a short\
  \ while ago. Man was I stunned by this beautiful diverse country and it\u2019s people.\n\
  \n I walked down a street called Princess Isabel in Copacobanna on my very first\
  \ day, looking for quick food before i check into my hotel. The first thing is see\
  \ is beautiful diverse friendly people. The statement that Brazilians are the most\
  \ excotic looking human beings, was instantly true. Women with tan skin, well built\
  \ & beautiful hair and handsome strong men with dark hair, all so friendly and kind,\
  \ greeting me \u201CBom Dia\u201D as i passed by. I felt welcome instantly, as if\
  \ I\u2019m part of them. I speak English. This is my nattive language. I did not\
  \ understand portugues very well, this is how they knew I\u2019m not a local.\n\n\
  Eventually i made my way to the beach. The city was slow in my opinion, it was 9am\
  \ with the Riosul mall still shut, stores only open at 10am. I noticed the beach\
  \ restaurants are all open planned, such a nice way of attracting people. I approached\
  \ one called Skol, the face of the mixed race waitress was welcoming. The first\
  \ thing i got was cocunut water. \u201DAgu\xE0 de Coco?\u201D was what she said\
  \ to confirm my order. We had a really good conversation about food. She told me\
  \ about Feijoada, because she was busy cooking it, apparently a dish the slaves\
  \ invented. A black bean and rice stew with the of cuts of pork meat. Smelled dilicious.\
  \ I heard of Coxhinna, a chicken filled pastry shaped almost like a teardrop, also\
  \ very traditional. She recommended i try A\xE7a\xED, which was a smoothie like\
  \ drink made of local fruits in Brazil. I tried it throughout my stay, all of it,l\
  \ and it\u2019s now my favorite.\n\nI was informed that Brazilians comes from four\
  \ different cultures, namely: portugues, african, native american and european hence\
  \ their rich diversity and exotic look. \n\nI saw the lifestyle of the people, running\
  \ on the beach promenade of Copacobanna that is tiled in a wave like manner, black\
  \ and grey, very pretty and unique. Ofcourse i learned that excessive clothing is\
  \ not something they prefer when training or beaching or just during carnival. It\
  \ made sense to me, as the weather was humid and hot.\n\nI explored a bit more.\
  \ Christ the Redeemer statue, Maracanna stadium, favelas, selaron steps - all such\
  \ great cultural history behind them.\n\nOne evening i was having supper at a local\
  \ restaurant, having Feijoada ofcourse, I met a samba school teacher. I do latin\
  \ american dancing competitively and samba dance was my main reason for traveling\
  \ to Brazil. Again another friendly warm brazilian lady, she invited me to join\
  \ her workshop the next day on the beach. Without two doubts, i found myself learning\
  \ samba in a brazilian bikini in a very hot sun. It was such a memorable experience.\
  \ I learned that dancing too was from the slaves, this was how they celebrated their\
  \ freedom and cultura. Samba dancing was not just shaking hips, no, it is in intense\
  \ celebration of pride, freedom, diversity and culture. I fell inlove on this day\
  \ with the freedom of expression, which is something so many countries fail to achieve.\
  \ I thought to myself this is why Brazil is such a tourist attraction. I ended up\
  \ parading in the sambadrome with this lady and her school. As i step into the sambadrome,\
  \ i embraced the opportunity with such alot of emotion, such a thrill and a dream\
  \ come true.\n\nMy holiday was rich of experiences and memories. I truly made myself\
  \ apart of them and their culture and that was the best way for me to experience\
  \ the country and the lifestyle of the people. This was definitely not my last visit.\
  \ I have now acquired new friends and divine connections. The universe works in\
  \ mysterious ways. Thank you beautiful Brazil, it was a pleasure visiting you."
