Text: 'I didn''t expect to find and see the genuine love and care from the most Patriotic
  Armenian people to the giggler Kazakh girl. When I was lucky enough to get to Armenia,
  in the beginning of the trip I was very afraid that will not fit into their society.
  Despite the fact that I was only there for a week, I thought about it and I really
  cared about. But what was my surprise when such a traditional and strict people
  took me as their own. There were many funny moment that I still hold in my heart,
  but most importantly, I realized that I wanted to in my country had the same attitude
  towards foreigners regardless of nationality, religion and citizenship. Kazakh people
  are famous for their hospitality, but who said that we have nothing and no one to
  learn something new. For me the attitude and friendliness of Armenians to the foreigner
  was a real discovery. Their warm relationship was expressed in many ways: help to
  find the right road to the hostel, and the desire to feed the poor tourist, and
  requests to return to Armenia soon. I''m a very kind person, but even for me, this
  mental attitude was a surprise and a lesson. This trip changed my life, so since
  then every day I try to be better.'
