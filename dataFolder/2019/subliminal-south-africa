Text: "Stepping out from my comfort zone after nineteen years of my life into the\
  \ unknown was a great leap. Cape Town, South Africa! What a beginning to my travel\
  \ experience! I have been in this city for almost five years now, but it still amazes\
  \ me like the first time I arrived. The locals, the food, the culture, everything\
  \ is overwhelming. The warmth of the people makes you feel like their own, you feel\
  \ the love and affection that this country has to offer. South Africa is a land\
  \ of wonder! From hiking the Table Mountain; one of the seven wonders of the world,\
  \ to sailing across the Altantic Ocean, everything is a gift. The wine farms are\
  \ sorrad all across the South Africa.  I visited over almost twenty wine farms,\
  \ the locally produced wine, acclaimed internationally. South Africa is multilingual,\
  \ from Afrikaans, Zulu, or Xhosa among others, I did not find myself to struggle\
  \ to communicate because English was predominant. The huge history of South Africa\
  \ has influenced the people. South Africans proudly showcase their collective heritage.\
  \ Moreover, from city life to adventure, wildlife to culture, breathtaking scenery\
  \ to sun-soaked coasts, South Africa is magic. I went on many road trips, from Cape\
  \ Town to Knysna, the Garden route as it is called, travelled to the Southernmost\
  \ tip of South Africa, Cape Agulhas where the Indian Ocean and Atlantic Ocean meet,\
  \ the scenic Chapman\u2019s Peak drive or evening sunsets at Signal Hill. I have\
  \ adopted South Africa and it\u2019s people in my heart. I can proudly say that\
  \ I have a new home. My heart is connected to this land and I now form a part of\
  \ it."
