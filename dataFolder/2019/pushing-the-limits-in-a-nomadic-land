Text: "\u201CHow do you define strength?\u201D My best friend, of a decade, asked.\
  \  \n\u201CStrength comes from knowing your limits but pushing yourself to the edge\
  \ of those limits.\u201D I offer.  Sarah is that friend that forces you to reexamine\
  \ your life goals each time you speak. \n \nDays earlier we met in Kyrgyzstan, the\
  \ \u201CPatagonia of central Asia\u201D, a rugged, mountainous country of nomadic\
  \ peoples, known for its natural beauty. In the extensive mountains and scenic valleys,\
  \ horses roam wild. Yurts stand among un-manicured cherry, and apple orchards and\
  \ \u201CCandyland\u201D domed mosques peak out behind painted wooden fences. \n\n\
  We set our sights on a horse trek, after all, horses were first tamed on the plains\
  \ of central Asia; followed by a climb to the emerald, lake Ala-Kul. Tucked just\
  \ in front of the Tien Shan Mountains, Ala-Kul, sits at 4000 meters and is only\
  \ reachable for the most active pursuers with extreme hiking from nearby Karakol,\
  \ via Altyn Arashan (yurt camp) and straight up Aka-Kul pass.  \n\nWe took \u201C\
  the world\u2019s most un-navigable road\u201D in a 1970s Soviet bus with reinforced\
  \ tires to Arashan. We had no idea what was in store for us when we hopped into\
  \ that small VW-like bus. Had we known - I do not think there was a chance we would\
  \ have started the journey.  \n\nWe rose before the sun in the still air, ate sweet\
  \ apricots and homemade jams with kaymak (cream), and boortsog (fried dough) with\
  \ excitement for breakfast. \n\nBut it seemed like we were destined not to make\
  \ it to Ala-Kul. Ten minutes into the drive, our bus broke down, we discovered an\
  \ old Soviet military truck willing to pull-start our bus back on the road. Over\
  \ rock fields, boulders, and small ponds on this road that should be a trail for\
  \ horses; our minibus shook, and jerked, up and down, side to side quite literally\
  \ tilting parallel to the river. We held onto the seats and the ceiling, white knuckling,\
  \ pressing our feet into any crevice to brace ourselves for the intense movements\
  \ yet to come. \n\n\u201CHow many buses have tumbled off this road?\u201D We anxiously\
  \ wondered, certain we were next. Our driver, Jenia, was a master of manual transmission\
  \ and managed to use a wrench to steady the gears during the most turbulent segments\
  \ of the drive with a grin. \n\n\u201CSpasibo!\u201D We gratefully cheered, when\
  \ we finally arrived in Arashan. \n\nBy noon, we were saddled up, holding leather\
  \ whips resembling dream catchers, in anticipation, the horses leapt into motion.\
  \ We trotted six miles through evergreen forests, across rocky creeks, over meadows\
  \ dotted with aster, and sprinkled with anemones. We cantered alongside playful\
  \ wild horses, grazing cows, and chirping marmots.\n\nWe dismounted at Alakul pass\
  \ basecamp. Happily, we ate salted butterbeans, almonds, and golden raisins by the\
  \ handful, from the bustling Ash bazaar in Bishkek. Then we set out for our destination.\
  \ \n\nAlakul was laden with crumbling rocks and tiny strawberry plants. We looked\
  \ up at a vertical incline to the summit. Tiny figures slowly ascended the short,\
  \ steep, crumbling switchbacks ahead.  \nWe caught our breath and began the one-vertical-mile\
  \ climb to the top. Sliding down a few inches with each step up. \n\nIt was mid-afternoon,\
  \ the sun reflected brightly on the snowy mountainside, melting a layer of snow\
  \ into coarse slippery gravel-like rocks, and causing us to slide further down with\
  \ each intense step.  \n\nThis must be what quicksand feels like. I assumed.  \n\
  Dark ominous storm clouds were forming in Arashan valley, and doubt that we could\
  \ beat the rains was growing. \n\nI hope we ascend before the clouds destroy our\
  \ view. I yearned.\nEvery few meters we stopped to catch our shallow breath and\
  \ to celebrate any progress.  \n\u201COne-third of the way!\u201D \u2013 \u201C\
  Halfway!\u201D We cheered! \u2013 \u201COnly 100 meters to go!\u201C\n\nAnd then,\
  \ we summited, high-fived, and bear-hugged to applaud a remarkable journey, and\
  \ a view of the turquoise, glacial Ala-Kul Lake! We walked another 15 meters to\
  \ a 360-degree view of Karakol peak, the surrounding glaciers, and the snowcapped\
  \ mountains of the Tien Shan range looking to southern Kyrgyzstan and beyond into\
  \ China. \n  \nAt the end of the road, we could not have imagined a better undertaking\
  \ amid the picturesque Kyrgyzstan Mountains."
