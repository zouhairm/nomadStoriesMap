Text: "One night in March as I bee-lined my way back to the Airbnb, maneuvering around\
  \ couples entwined in the lamplight, I remember thinking: Paris is a great place\
  \ to be in love, but just as shitty a place to be broken up with.\n \nLet me back\
  \ this up. We were sleep deprived. Our flight landed late, our bus arrived later,\
  \ our stop on the underground further than expected, our Airbnb host less compliant,\
  \ less specific than was required. We arrived at a nightclub to pick up the key.\
  \ The woman I love descended slippery steps flashing in the strobe of the underground.\
  \ She approached the bar to ask for the key, her voice, blanketed by the deep pulse\
  \ of the music and the deafening human noise of a drunk polyglot mob on the dance\
  \ floor, rang out in pigeon French\n.\n\u200BBut she succeeded and returned with\
  \ the key. We lugged suitcases up several floors, opened the door, only to search\
  \ in vain for the mattress that had been falsely advertised. In a sweaty fourth\
  \ floor apartment we were forced to open the windows to the drunken reveling below.\
  \ Futon kinks in our backs, our pillows throbbed with the same base-line people\
  \ danced to below and we laughed. We laughed for our aching limbs, frayed nerves,\
  \ but mostly we laughed at the absurdity of it all. This we smiled knowingly is\
  \ Paris. Is the world.\n \nThe next day we showered in a mold-begrimed tub (with\
  \ no shower rack the woman I love moaned).\nOutside the city shone beneath a drizzle\
  \ that gave a sheen to all it touched. Paris glowed with the sleepy warmth of your\
  \ favorite coffee shop. We walked through the ostentations of Notre Dame, where\
  \ humans sought to build the womb of God. Over the Seine we walked, our eyes scanning\
  \ the world like puppies, incapable of lingering on any one thing for long.\n \n\
  Despite my best efforts, I ate grumpily. Exhaustion, hunger and frustration began\
  \ to weigh heavily on me.\n \nWhile waiting in a department store for the woman\
  \ I love, I watched other men hold bags, assume the same awkward poses of the romantically\
  \ obligated. How is it that we all spoke the same language of discomfort?\n \nAfter\
  \ macrons that disappointed, trees still weeks away from blooming and Eiffel Tower\
  \ mud that clung to my clothes, we ended up in a restaurant to reverse the fate\
  \ of our evening. We ate bread and cheese, drank wine all of which bespoke tradition.\n\
  \ \nWe left with a wine-induced weave to our step. A bottle in her tanned hand,\
  \ she hiccupped on the Parisian cobble and the Seine danced in the evening light.\
  \ For a few brief moments the world stood still before it all fell down with the\
  \ gleaming diamond of the Eiffel tower in the distance.\n\nWhile couples kissed\
  \ around us, she whispered, \u201CWe have nothing in common.\u201D"
