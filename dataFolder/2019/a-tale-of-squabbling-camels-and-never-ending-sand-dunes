Text: "As I hoisted my right leg up and over the camel\u2019s saddle, I wondered what\
  \ I was getting myself in for. I\u2019d had a few horse riding lessons when I was\
  \ a child, but I could tell this was going to be a completely different experience.\
  \ Although the camel smelt distinctly horse-like, it towered above the ground and\
  \ kept stomping its feet, swaying me from left to right. I clutched onto the reins,\
  \ the coarse rope digging into my palms, and hoped that I wouldn\u2019t humiliate\
  \ myself by tumbling off sideways. \n\nMy tour group and I were all excited to get\
  \ to our next destination \u2013 the desert camp near Merzouga, in Morocco, where\
  \ we would be staying the night. I was decidedly out of my comfort zone. It was\
  \ my first time on a camel, in a desert, in Morocco, on the African continent and\
  \ I had never been camping before. With a mix of excitement and trepidation, I waited\
  \ for the rest of the tour group to clamber, as gracefully as they could, onto their\
  \ camels. \nSuddenly there was a commotion and a sharp, screeching noise. Two of\
  \ the camels had started fighting, slamming their heads together and using their\
  \ body weight to try and push the other over. Unfortunately two of my fellow tour\
  \ group members were already sitting on the brawling camels, lurching from side\
  \ to side, up and down, clinging onto the reins with terrified looks on their faces.\
  \ Local guides rushed over, some pulling the tourists from the saddles, as others\
  \ tried to separate and calm the camels. If my hands hadn't been gripping my reins\
  \ so tightly, I would have crossed my fingers that my camel didn't start his own\
  \ ruckus. Fortunately, he seemed completely oblivious to the drama around us. \n\
  \nIt was the second day of our desert excursion. Unfortunately, communication was\
  \ somewhat lacking. Our bus driver spoke fluent French and Arabic, whereas the tour\
  \ group members spoke English, German, Spanish and very limited French, learned\
  \ at school but mostly forgotten. Every stop was therefore a mystery until an English-speaking\
  \ guide wandered over to explain where we were and what we were there to see. The\
  \ camel trek guides spoke English but didn\u2019t inform us how long the ride would\
  \ be. One member of our group thought it might take half an hour, as a friend of\
  \ hers had done a thirty-minute desert ride the year before. Well, that friend got\
  \ lucky! The thirty-minute mark came and went; our guide gave no indication of stopping.\
  \ \n\nAs far as the eye could see, sand dunes gently sloped up and down, their smooth\
  \ surface occasionally disturbed by a light patter of footprints. It was a spectacular\
  \ sight. Soon it was just us, the camels and the majestic Sahara desert. Along with\
  \ an undeniable discomfort that we tried to ignore, as the saddles dug deep into\
  \ our thighs and crotches. It was like being on a slow-moving rollercoaster, in\
  \ an incredibly beautiful environment, where your seat was trying to permanently\
  \ disfigure you. Our cotton trousers were no match for the hard, wooden saddles.\
  \ All around me, I heard wincing and sharp intakes of breath. The men in the group\
  \ seemed to be suffering far worse than the women! \n\nYou\u2019ll be pleased to\
  \ hear that we did eventually get to the campsite. What we hoped might take thirty\
  \ minutes\u2026.maybe sixty\u2026actually took two hours. Sliding off the camels,\
  \ we groaned, rubbed our aching thighs and looked around. We saw tents pitched onto\
  \ the sand, some filled with tables to serve as our dining area, others for sleeping.\
  \ Walking with a cowboy waddle, most commonly seen in Westerns, we made our way\
  \ towards the tantalizing smells of hot mint tea. Morocco is a predominantly dry\
  \ country, with alcohol hard to come by. In that moment, we all could have done\
  \ with spiking our mint tea with something stronger!"
