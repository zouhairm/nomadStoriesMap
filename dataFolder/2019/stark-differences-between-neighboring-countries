Text: "I didn\u2019t know what to expect upon arriving in India after having spent\
  \ a week in Sri Lanka. As the Director of Development with the non-profit organization\
  \ Children Incorporated, I have traveled all over the world reporting on the burden\
  \ of poverty that children face, but still, India was a place of wonder to me. \n\
  I was curious to see what more I would come to understand about India on my first\
  \ trip there, especially when it came to the differences between India and Sri Lanka\
  \ in terms of educating kids. \n\nI was aware that much of the poverty in the country\
  \ has to do with the inadequate education system in the country. Almost half of\
  \ India\u2019s population drops out of school by the age of thirteen, often so that\
  \ the adolescents can work to provide additional income for their families. Unlike\
  \ its neighboring country, Sri Lanka, where education is of the utmost importance,\
  \ with a literacy rate of over ninety percent, India\u2019s literacy rate is only\
  \ 63 percent, meaning many poor children are not being educated early in life when\
  \ it is crucial for them to be in school.\n\nWhen I arrived in Hyderabad, the capital\
  \ of the state of Telangana and the fourth most populous city in India, it didn\u2019\
  t feel much different from the experience I had when I arrived in Sri Lanka, except\
  \ for one aspect \u2013 the amount of housing that I saw on either side of the highway\
  \ was astounding. It was the first indication that we were in an incredibly populated\
  \ part of the world, which was unlike Sri Lanka, whose population is only around\
  \ 21 million people \u2013 or 5.7 percent of India\u2019s population. The landscape\
  \ was blanketed with concrete apartment buildings as far as I could see, many of\
  \ them twenty stories high; and this scene went on for an hour before I reached\
  \ the city.\n\nOnce I arrived in Hyderabad, the differences between it and Colombo,\
  \ the capital city of Sri Lanka, were more obvious. Whereas we didn\u2019t see beggars\
  \ on the streets in Colombo, I saw multiple ones at each stoplight in Hyderabad.\
  \ The traffic was dense and chaotic, and smog from the cars was thick in the air.\
  \ It was more of what I had expected of India \u2013 busy and crowded, with signs\
  \ of extreme poverty.\n\nEarly the next morning, I traveled four hours east to the\
  \ Chandrakal Methodist Boarding Home where Children Incorporated supports children\
  \ by paying their school fees. As I left Hyderabad, the highways turned into narrow\
  \ rural roads, where I saw livestock and large fields of rice and corn crops. Hindu\
  \ temples lined the newly-paved highway.\n\nWhen I arrived at the home, I was greeted\
  \ by our Volunteer Coordinator, Pearl. Pearl talked about how if it weren\u2019\
  t for Children Incorporated, many of these children would never get the chance to\
  \ go to school. It is a great relief for parents, who are mostly low-paid farmers,\
  \ and who are unable to pay the entire monthly fee for room and board and tuition,\
  \ to receive help.\n\nI was impressed with how large the school's compound was,\
  \ and how many buildings it contained, but all the structures were very old and\
  \ in need of a lot of repairs. I remembered that some of our projects in Sri Lanka\
  \ are also in older buildings, but they are still in good shape. Some of the buildings\
  \ at the Chandrakal Methodist Boarding Home looked as though they should be torn\
  \ down and rebuilt entirely. A few even looked unsafe to enter.\n\nI asked Pearl\
  \ about the difficulties of educating children in India. She said that many families\
  \ want to send their children to school, but there are few schools near rural areas.\
  \ Unlike Sri Lanka, where there are schools close by for children to attend during\
  \ the day, and then return to their families each afternoon, in India, children\
  \ have to go far away to a boarding school and stay full-time, which parents often\
  \ cannot afford. It occurred to me then that although I was trying to compare the\
  \ two countries because they were close to one another, they were worlds apart when\
  \ it came to educating children living in poverty."
