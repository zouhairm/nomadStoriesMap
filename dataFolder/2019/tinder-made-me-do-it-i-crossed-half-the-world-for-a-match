Text: "I'm a 23 year old peruvian girl. Born and raised in Lima, I longed to see what\
  \ else my country had to offer. So, when I turned 18, I travelled. I saved every\
  \ vacation day off work, every extra cent and just travelled. The coast, the andes\
  \ and the rainforest all saw me walk their lands, bravely trying their local foods,\
  \ facing the mosquitoes, swiming in cuestionable rivers, sunbathing whenever I had\
  \ the chance or freezing my ass off (I'm looking at you, Puno!).\n\nLast year, a\
  \ friend decided to visit me in Per\xFA. Barbara and I had met online six years\
  \ ago, but it was our first time seeing each other face to face. We had planned\
  \ a big trip all over the country and counted the days until we would meet.\n\n\
  At the same time, I had been dumped a few months ago, and was trying the Tinder\
  \ life. It hadn't been working for me and I'd meet more jerks than I could count\
  \ on, but I knew at least I could laugh about my failed dates with my friends.\n\
  \nOne afternoon, out of sheer boredom, I went back to my old matches, and found\
  \ one I didn't remember. A guy who was a photographer, who didn't have a single\
  \ picture of his face on Instagram, only a lot of landscapes. I hit him up with\
  \ a modest \"Hey! Cool pics\". We talked over Tinder, eventually moved to WhatsApp,\
  \ and then decided to meet in person. I promised myself that if this guy ended up\
  \ being a jerk, I would give up online dating.\n\nWe met. His name was Tadeu, he\
  \ was Spanish and I was surprised. We talked all night and had tons of fun, but\
  \ he told me he was leaving Lima in three weeks. \"Oh well, at least he isn't a\
  \ jerk\", I thought. I didn't expect to see him again, but the next day he asked\
  \ me out for a movie and I said yes. We starting going out. A lot. We made those\
  \ three weeks seem like three months. \n\nThe day he was leaving, was the day my\
  \ friend was arriving to Lima. I'd never been so happy and so sad at the same time.\
  \ He left and we kept in touch, first in a cold way, then in a hopefull way. He\
  \ kept asking me to go visit him in Barcelona and I kept refusing.\n\n\"If anything\
  \ goes badly, you can come to Paris\", was Barbara's response when I told her about\
  \ it, in the middle of our trip, while we were both suffering from altitude sickness\
  \ in Cusco. \"Life doesn't work that way\", was my response, before throwing up\
  \ in a bucket. Machu Picchu was amazing, but that was the price to pay for it.\n\
  \nIt took a few months, but I ended up quitting my job, packing my bags and going\
  \ to Barcelona. I was scared. Scared things wouldn't work out, that I would hate\
  \ the city or the guy and I would be sad, because I would feel stupid. Scared that\
  \ things would work out and I would be sad, because I would have to leave. \n\n\
  Things worked out. The minute I stepped in Barcelona I felt it was a long lost home.\
  \ The little caf\xE9s at El Born reminded me of the ones in Barranco, back in Lima;\
  \ the fancy shops at Passeig de Gracia stunned me, the arquitecture, the culture,\
  \ everything seemed to seduce me into staying. After two months I foudn myself in\
  \ love with the city...and with the guy. \n\nSo, I did what I had to do. I applied\
  \ for a student visa (and got it!). Cancelled my things in Lima, and moved here.\
  \ If you had told me a year ago, I'd be in Barcelona, with someone I love deeply,\
  \ studying Catalan, I'd have said you were crazy. But boy, life happens. \n\nOh,\
  \ and I'm going to visit Barbara in Paris next month! Travelling is never out of\
  \ the question."
