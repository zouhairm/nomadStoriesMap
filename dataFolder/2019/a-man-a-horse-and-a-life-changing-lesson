Text: "I never thought a man could change my life, but here I am. \nI heard so many\
  \ amazing stories about Tunisia, but seeing it in person was a whole another adventure.\
  \ As soon as we walked out of the plane I was hit by a dense and wet-feeling heat.\
  \ It was a completely new sensation to me, although oddly satisfying. My eyes immediately\
  \ landed on the sight of majestic palm trees, shining underneath the blinding sun.\
  \ My eyes hurt a little bit, however I couldn\u2019t stop staring at that exciting\
  \ view. My heart was rapidly filled with extreme happiness. \n    The smell of the\
  \ ocean was profound and intensified by the power of the gigantic waves created\
  \ by the wind. It was my first time standing on the shore of this magnificent creation.\
  \ My feet were buried underneath the warm sand and a light breeze was dancing in\
  \ between my hair. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever breathed such a fresh air.\
  \ The water slowly turned golden beneath the setting sun and sudden calm and quietness\
  \ spread across the beach. \n    I was approached by a man on a marvelous black\
  \ horse. Its fur was so intensely black that it almost reflected the sunset happening\
  \ in front of our eyes. \n\u201CI hate my work, but this sunset makes it a little\
  \ more good.\u201D- said the man.\nAfter a moment of silence, he revealed to me\
  \ that his job was to let the tourists ride his horses on the beach throughout the\
  \ day. He told me that many many people liked his horses just to take nice pictures\
  \ and that they didn\u2019t really appreciate the real beauty of the animal.  I\
  \ could see from his drained dark eyes how tired he was. His hands and face, being\
  \ the only uncovered parts of his body, were very dark and damaged by the sun. He\
  \ said- \u201C Nothing can take away my happiness when I\u2019m with my horses.\u201D\
  \ Every time he mentioned his animals, his expression lit up. It was like seeing\
  \ a little child talking about his favorite treat. \n     At the end of our small\
  \ talk he left me alone on the beach. I wasn\u2019t actually alone though, his positive\
  \ spirit and kindness stuck with me. As I sat on the sand and was looking at the\
  \ dark blue sky filled with millions of bright stars, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking\
  \ about how tiny place in this world I actually occupy. Sometimes I would get caught\
  \ up in things that don\u2019t really matter, forgetting completely what makes me\
  \ happy. It is scary how easily we can loose track of our own happiness. \n    That\
  \ short encounter changed my perspective on life and on what is really important.\
  \ \nAnd this is what traveling should be about. Teaching and learning. It should\
  \ be all about making connections- with nature, people, food and everything that\
  \ surrounds that certain country. It should be about being present and willing to\
  \ leave a small part of ourselves thousands of miles from our homes."
