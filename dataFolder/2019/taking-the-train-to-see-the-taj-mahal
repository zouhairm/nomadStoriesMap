Text: "We landed in Jaipur at 2:45 am. After we slept in and got up late the owner\
  \ of our hotel was taking pictures of us in the garden. I felt there was something\
  \ moving behind me. I turned around and saw a group of monkeys chasing around. The\
  \ owner said, \u201Cwhat you can see in the zoo at home, you can see here in the\
  \ city. India is a country full of life!\u201D Just minutes later his word was proven\
  \ right. After we left to stroll down the street we saw a random camel in a backyard,\
  \ a donkey pulling a cart, an elephant, a horse and some goats. Not to forget there\
  \ were cows, cows everywhere.\n\nI really love the shared tuk-tuks in India because\
  \ they are electrical and you can share them to save money. Better for you, better\
  \ for the environment. We got off at the beautiful \u201CHawa Mahal\u201D or translated\
  \ \u201CWindy Palace\u201D which was inspired by the crown of Lord Krishna. Inside\
  \ you find a lot of colorful glasses decorating the many, many small windows. It\
  \ was built by the king for ladies-in-waiting to admire his beautiful city.\n\n\
  While walking around we got curious about a nearby temple. There was a ceremony\
  \ going on and a kind local invited us to have a little snack. He explained that\
  \ evening there will be a parade to celebrate Lord Krishna\u2019s birthday. Lucky\
  \ us! We decided to see one more thing before the parade and went to the \u201C\
  Albert Hall Museum\u201D, where a mummy named \u201CTutu\u201D is kept. It\u2019\
  s more than 2,300 years old! That was my first time seeing the real mummy. I\u2019\
  ve been pretty excited.\n\nThe next day we traveled to Agra by train. Two Indian\
  \ women sitting opposite of us started preparing food - on the train! Peeled cucumbers,\
  \ tomatoes and onions. Flavored with lemon and salt to prepare meals for their husbands\
  \ and children. After the vegetable, they prepared roti with a chili sauce. Very\
  \ kind as they were, they shared their food with us too. Lucky us again! We were\
  \ so full while we were originally worried to be hungry on the long train ride at\
  \ the beginning. I wanted to give something in return, but I had nothing except\
  \ a Thai cooling candy in my pocket. I shared it with the families to try. They\
  \ liked it, especially the kids and they started to talk to us. I show the kids\
  \ a hand-trick where you join your hands while hiding one finger and then let them\
  \ guess which finger is missing. We all were having fun with this game and laughed\
  \ together whenever someone guessed it wrong. We played this game all the way until\
  \ arrived at our destination Agra. It was time to say goodbye. We thanked the families\
  \ and especially the women for their kindness to share their food and time with\
  \ us.\n\nThe Taj Mahal, one of the seven wonders of the world and the symbol of\
  \ love, is situated here. Coming slowly closer, you will see the loftily, beautiful\
  \ white marble mausoleum getting bigger and bigger. The colorful flowers on the\
  \ walls of the building aren\u2019t painted.  Each flower is crafted piece by piece\
  \ from stones in various colors. The red stone making up the flowers light up beautifully\
  \ when shined on with a flashlight. Sadly, over 20,000 workers died during the 20\
  \ years of construction. At the end the king had all remaining workers kill to ensure\
  \ they won\u2019t build any similar buildings. \n\nThe construction costs were extremely\
  \ high and the king\u2019s son took the throne and arrested his own father. The\
  \ king was arrested in Agra Fort and left only a little window to see his symbol\
  \ of love. The story tells that he died with a mirror in his hand to have a last\
  \ glimpse on the Taj Mahal. Seeing the Taj Mahal in real was a childhood dream of\
  \ myself coming true."
