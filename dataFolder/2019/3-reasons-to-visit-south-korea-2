Text: "I love Asia very much, there're different architect and culture. South Korea\
  \ paid my attention few years ago and I've traveled there. Now I want to share with\
  \ you 3th reasons come there.\n\n1. Architect \n\nSouth Korea was built on the hills,\
  \ so small streets can go up or down, turn right or left, intersects with big avenue\
  \ - it brings on a specific feeling. Ther're skyscrapers, small houses, Buddhist\
  \ temples, palaces and shopping malls can be on the same street. For example, in\
  \ Seoul ther's Gyeongbokgung Palace, everythings here brings back the sense of old\
  \ times: a summer terrace with a small pond, dormant heron, young women and men\
  \ are wearing traditional dress Hanbok. It makes you calm and relax, so it's a little\
  \ shocking come back to the modern, noise and technology city.\n\nNight life there's\
  \ very active: illuminated streets with neon signs, paper lanterns, music is playing,\
  \ tired workers go to the cafe, restaurants and bars, couple walks on the streets\
  \ and parks. Meanwhile, in South Korea lovers wear the same sneakers or t-shirts,\
  \ it's special way to show they're together, because in Asian culturally not accepted\
  \ public kisses and hold hands. \n\nBusan is the main port of South Korea, so there're\
  \ a lot of beaches and bridges. One of popular is The Gwangandaegyo or Diamond Bridge\
  \ looks very beautiful with the night lights. On the promenade are many hotels,\
  \ cafe, malls, they make modern and urban image. Also there's creative and inspirit\
  \ atmosphere because local bands and groups are singing, playing and dancing k-pop\
  \ on the streets.\n\nIf you looking for rest and the nature - go to Gyeongju city.\
  \ Korean comes there for a holiday: hotels, villas, SPA-centers, water-parks, trade\
  \ & entertainment centres, palaces, temples and etc. There's Bulguksa - a head temple\
  \ of Korean Buddhism, in 1995 it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. In\
  \ the territory are thousandth paper lanterns with wishes and prayers, you can buy\
  \ one and create your note. Wooden terrace of temple, smell of incense, knocking\
  \ of swaying lanterns and sound of forest are healing you soul. \n\n2. Korean food\n\
  \nHere's literally cult of food, feels like you may find cafe or konbini on every\
  \ street. Because of nice smell of fried meat or stewed vegetables, somehow you\
  \ will join to this cult. Although there owners of little cafes often make fried\
  \ fish outside and a smell is so-so. \n\nConvenience stores, known as konbini, sell\
  \ food, drinks, body care products and etc. Everyone has tables, microwaves, hot\
  \ water: you can make noodle soup, tea or coffee, warm food up, sit and eat there.\
  \ For West people konbini is like museum, food there's interesting and unfamiliar.\
  \ Looking in the aisles you have to think: is it sweet, or salty, or bitter, or\
  \ spicy, if it is spicy how much? Stop, is it food, or..? For example, dried fish\
  \ there's sweet, not salty, snacks and yogurts are pretty tasty but sometimes they\
  \ have pretty weird. \n\nKorean cuisine's spicy, but there are many European or\
  \ American cafe. You have to keep in mind - dish is pretty big. When you order meat\
  \ or soup, you will get a carafe of water, 5-6 small dishes with snacks: depends\
  \ on place and meal there can be kimchi, beansprouts, pickled potatoes, fresh vegetables\
  \ or sweet omelette and fruits. In traditional Korean restaurant gas or charcoal\
  \ grills built into the table itself, it uses mostly for barbecue or soup. You can\
  \ make grilled meat with marinated or unmarinated raw pork, beef or chicken. Also\
  \ Koreans cut meat with scissors, if you try you will see how it's comfortable.\n\
  \n3. Shopping\n\nShopping areas, malls, markets in subway - ir's a heaven for shopaholicic.\
  \ Shopping areas are noisy, there're always many people, salers lured with free\
  \ items, smells street food, neon signs are shine, k-pop is playing. On the other\
  \ hand one of the biggest shopping malls is Lotte has all kind of fashion store\
  \ (expensive and middle), aquarium, huge market Lotte Mart with not only food, but\
  \ electronic, cosmetic and etc. Korean cosmetic is popular around the world and\
  \ there you may find everything what you want. Just look on badge of saler, usually\
  \ there written which language he can speak."
