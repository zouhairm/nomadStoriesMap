Text: "It\u2019s was 4 pm in the afternoon I went out in my hotel to get a cab going\
  \ to the blue mosque, when I reached the blue mosque I paid the metered taxi it\
  \ was 45 Turkish lira so I gave the driver 50 lira and got the 5 lira changed and\
  \ when I went down the driver called me and showed me 5 lira, he is insisting that\
  \ I only gave him 5 lira so what I did I got the 5 lira and gave him 50 lira and\
  \ when the taxi left I counted my money I was surprised that I gave him two 50 liras,\
  \ by the way The 100$ is equivalent to 145 lira, after visiting the mosque I saw\
  \ a restaurant and there is a chef and I ordered to him and told him what happened\
  \ and he told me that is the problem of the government in Turkey to most of the\
  \ taxi driver because they do that always to the tourist. So what I did in order\
  \ to retrieve what I lost I ride a bus going to my hotel which is more cheaper,\
  \ so my plans was a success I reached Taksim place which is my hotel located, when\
  \ I reached that area I cannot find my hotel because it was covered by some buildings,\
  \ so there\u2019s a guy standing near me, I asked him where is Hilton and he said\
  \ it\u2019s over there and he asked me if I want a lady, I told him next time, but\
  \ he keeps on following me and told me just look at the place, so I followed him\
  \ because in my mind it was a bar and I want to drink and when I entered the place\
  \ it was so dark with red lights and he let me seat at the table and that guy also\
  \ seat in front of me and there came this 2 ladies and sat besides me and the other\
  \ one besides him and came a waiter gave us a drink which I didn\u2019t order, so\
  \ I told this guy I just want to see the place, so all of them went out of the table\
  \ and there came the waiter with the bill which cost 500$ And I insisted to the\
  \ waiter that I will not pay that because I did not order it and after that the\
  \ bouncer seat besides me and pull my wallet at my back and saw a 300$ and got it\
  \ and its a good thing that I left some of my money in the hotel, so I make a drama\
  \ to this bouncer which I\u2019m scared already, I told him that this is the only\
  \ money I left and I will leave Istanbul tomorrow, so what he did he return the\
  \ 100$ Only and let me go, when I went out to that place I was running and so nervous\
  \ and the place is just near to my hotel,  so It was a big lesson to me when traveling\
  \ do not trust anyone."
