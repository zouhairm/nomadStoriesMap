Text: "I couldn't feel anything from the waist down; my lower parts were completely\
  \ numb, while, my upper body was freezing. I was naked and shivering. I could hear\
  \ the clacking of instruments and the shadows of medical staff shuffling around.\
  \ I could barely apprehend sounds and my vision was blurred. I had never felt so\
  \ exposed and vulnerable in my entire existence.\n\n1466 kilometers away from home,\
  \ here I was, laying on an operation table, in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia,\
  \ not knowing whether I would be able to walk again. Who knew that my birthday ski\
  \ trip, for which I had waited so eagerly, would become the biggest life lesson\
  \ I have ever had.\n\nFrom the moment we set foot at the airport, it felt like home.\
  \ \"I want to live here,\" Glen said. My boyfriend and I fell completely in love\
  \ with the warmth and hospitality of this small nation. The picturesque city, which\
  \ somehow had subtly mixed the urban underground and graffiti lifestyle with imperial\
  \ massive bridges and buildings, had us. We intuitively got lost in tiny taverns\
  \ and dusky meandering streets indulging ourselves in wine-tasting and local cuisine.\
  \ \n\nTime was racing and the next stop on our list was the powdery slope of Gudauri.\
  \ It was mid-week when we arrived and just an ordinary morning when the accident\
  \ occurred. Just one of those cloudy mornings and a rattled ski lift, me testing\
  \ the slopes and next thing you know is bamm! \n\nThe pain was surreal. I could\
  \ remember the snowmobile, then the rhythmic breathing and me counting 100,99,98,97\u2026\
  \ Glen told me later that I needed extra morphine to fall asleep so they can readjust\
  \ my halved lower leg.\nAn hour later the ambulance was racing on the icy and slippery\
  \ mountain roads, hauling behind it was our Toyota Prius rental on summer tires,\
  \ with Glen behind the wheel (oh yes, don't forget to double-check your rental in\
  \ the Caucasus)\n\nThe following hour and a half was just a span of existence. We\
  \ were back in Tbilisi, straight to the ER at the nearest hospital, and I was in\
  \ the operation room for over three hours. When I opened my eyes, they were desperately\
  \ searching for my partner. I felt like an infant who had just lost a parent, ready\
  \ to wail. I couldn\xB4t move a fiber and my head was about to explode, it felt\
  \ like hours before a nurse came to send me to an assigned room.\n\nThank God! He\
  \ was there - waiting. It was a moment of immense relief and a cry for a cuddle.\
  \ My body was weak, shaking with those last few muscles that were still able to\
  \ twitch. I couldn't help but wonder what happened? Was this all a bad dream? Was\
  \ I going to be okay? What were we going to do? How long would we have to stay here?\
  \ \n\nThe next week was a constant battle with nothing but time and patience, insurance\
  \ and survival, body and health. This 10x10 space became our fortress. Like clockwork,\
  \ every two hours a nurse came by to check on me. \n\u2018Ana, \u0431\u043E\u043B\
  \u0438\u0442?' (Ana, does it hurt?)\nI was trying to put on a brave face\n\u2018\
  \u0427\u0443\u0442 \u0447\u0443\u0442' (\u0410 little bit) \n\nThe nurse's smell\
  \ was sweet. She felt safe. I was instinctively leaning towards her to catch a whiff,\
  \ while she was changing my IVs. It was almost like she could understand me just\
  \ by my movements.\n\nTwo medical flights overseas and a week later I was in Sofia,\
  \ Bulgaria- my home country. The nurse didn't smell as sweet. They were tossing\
  \ me around from one bed to another like an inanimate object and changed my room\
  \ so many times I could barely remember left and right. I was home but it didn't\
  \ feel like it. Here they spoke my language, but only verbally. I felt like an alien,\
  \ as though someone had dropped me off on a random planet and didn't even check\
  \ if I landed correctly.\n\nAll I know now is - I am still here. Home is just a\
  \ word. Home felt more familiar in a distant country. A good heart can provide safety\
  \ anywhere and shelter a broken body. I know Georgia sheltered mine."
