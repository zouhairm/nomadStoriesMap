Text: "Time is running out. The brave volunteer rangers of Addo Elephant National\
  \ Park will soon be sweeping the landscape, expelling all intruders made up of glaring\
  \ metal and clunky rubber, achieving their daily renewal of the bush to its natural\
  \ and seemingly untouched beauty. And alas, the maned beasts I have spent the past\
  \ three days searching for, will be free to roam and hunt without alien eyes upon\
  \ them. It was not my intent to stretch my time in their home to the very last second,\
  \ teasing the boundaries so clearly spelled out upon my arrival. But they have sheltered\
  \ well against the dry heat of the sun, and my belief in this journey, of what is\
  \ possible, is holding strong against the resistance of time. It was not my first\
  \ safari, after all, exploring the sandy backveld of this vast country, South Africa.\
  \ But, I remind myself now, it is merely my second. As I drive at a slow 30 km/h\
  \ to avoid further threatening the extinction of the dung beetles who have burrowed\
  \ themselves into the large piles of grassy elephant droppings that unapologetically\
  \ fill the park\u2019s main unpolished dirt road, my heart sinks deeper and deeper\
  \ as the last 40 kilometre stretch leads me toward the gate and out of the park\
  \ for the last time. And suddenly, just ten kilometres from the gate, a grouping\
  \ of dark speckles blots the yellow plain to the distant west of the main road,\
  \ catching my attention and lifting my heart back up into my chest. My Volkswagen\
  \ Polo stops dead in its tracks. Straight ahead is the gate, and I would make it\
  \ by sundown if I obey my current path. Veering right would lead me to the herd\
  \ of buffalo that I suspect are being hunted by a pride of hungry lionesses desperate\
  \ to feed their offspring who are safely sheltered nearby. And without hesitation,\
  \ right I go.\n\nMy first visit to South Africa, only a year prior, was spent exploring\
  \ with a local guide, whose respect for the land he borrowed time on each day was\
  \ beyond any truth I had experienced. His connection was spiritual, and so visible\
  \ in his presence that it left me vibrating with the faith that if one truly believes,\
  \ that connection is possible for anyone who seeks it. And so, I sought it out.\
  \ In contrast to the days I spent in a luxurious private reserve with a guide born\
  \ to track the Big 5 through unmarked space by simply listening to deep rumbles\
  \ originating from kilometres away, I am spending this visit in a public park, self-driving\
  \ and self-guiding my way to once again experience an African safari that dreams\
  \ are made of. Most of all, I yearn to lay my eyes once more upon the King of the\
  \ bush.\n\nSo here I am, having driven around His kingdom for three days, stopping\
  \ countless times in awe to let giant, insistent elephants cross my path, spying\
  \ on skittish zebra during their never ending meal time, watching buffalo graze\
  \ the African planes on which they merely survive. And as I veer right, down the\
  \ path I hope will lead me to glory, I see them. Three sleek blonde coats, maneless,\
  \ strategically circling a herd of united buffalo who are determined to escape their\
  \ fate. His surrounding kingdom stands still as if frozen in time. I watch as a\
  \ standoff turns to battle, then back again. And then the mood shifts, to one of\
  \ impossibly deeper stillness. The source of this power, I see only seconds later,\
  \ is two large maned beasts coming into view just feet away, pushing their way toward\
  \ their pride. Deep rumbles escape them as they look down upon the battle, before\
  \ they settle calmly in place, somewhere between the cubs they undoubtedly left\
  \ safely hidden, and the hunters they trust to return with their dinner. As I watch\
  \ them in complete stillness and silence, I am reminded that I am but a mere trespasser\
  \ in their kingdom, witnessing the circle of life we do not share. Returning my\
  \ attention to the battle below, I feel pure gratitude for this as she pounces."
