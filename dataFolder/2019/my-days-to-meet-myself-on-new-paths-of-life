Text: "It was indeed my one of the best experiences I had when I was in 9th standard\
  \ and spent a year in Haryana for Mimi migration. \nWe were students of Jawahar\
  \ navodaya vidyalaya, a boarding school famous in India and I am crazy to go and\
  \ travel to the places I've never been before and that is why when teacher came\
  \ to ask us in 8th class that who were willing to spend a year in Haryana and study\
  \ there, I was the one who had raised my hand first among all my classmates. I was\
  \ waiting for this moment since I was in 6th as I couldn't imagine to go there on\
  \ my own due to my family's poor economical condition. And finally I got that chance!\
  \ It was really going to be like a leap into unknown for me and I was ready for\
  \ it.\n\nI always believe that travelling is not the matter of money but the courage\
  \ as I have seen that there are some people who has earned enough to live on but\
  \ afraid to travel leaving their home behind.. or afraid to spend even a penny to\
  \ explore this beautiful world! However there are some courageous snails who earns\
  \ money to live and feels alive by travelling only.  And I really wish to be one\
  \ of them.\nI don't want to regret it later that I missed to travel this place even\
  \ in my dreams!\n\nI was really happy when I got selected among those 22 students\
  \ who were going to live in Haryana for a year. It was a 19 hours travel by train\
  \ from Wardha to Delhi and then 2-3 more to reach Haryana. We were feeling exhausted\
  \ at that time. Haryana, the home of Gods. It is where the golden rays of the rising\
  \ sun penetrate the verdant fields and the chirping of birds lend a sweet music\
  \ to the ears. The hookas in mouths of elder people, the cows in every household,\
  \ the khaats, the milk, the paddy fields with greenery, the colorful festivals and\
  \ the folk music with dance on the rhythm of the legs of beautiful ladies...etc.\
  \ There is also a place called Kurukshetra, the place where Lord Krishna narrated\
  \ the divine Bhagvat Gita to Arjuna during the epic battle of Mahabharata. We were\
  \ living in district Sonipat at that time. Nearby, there is another district called\
  \ Panipat, the city which was found by Pandvas in Mahabharata and the ancient land\
  \ where the battles of Panipat were fought. \nThen there is Gurgaon city which is\
  \ a fastest growing industrial and financial center of India. People believe that\
  \ Guru Dronacharya gave spiritual knowledge to the Pandavas and the Kauravas here.\
  \ One of the major attractions of the city is the Shitala Mata Mandir considered\
  \ to be the goddess of small-pox. The temple gets flooded every year with lots of\
  \ tourists and people to get rid from the small pox disease and to seek the blessings\
  \ of the Goddess.\nI spent my 1 year there with my friends and without my family\
  \ of course, but I was happy at that time. In that year, I lost my grandma and grandpa\
  \ as they left me behind in this world and my mom told me this after a year when\
  \ I went back to my home as she also wanted to let me live that experience I was\
  \ looking forward to. I miss both of them so much. \nI think I love to travel sometimes\
  \ to loose myself in thay floating moments and most of the time I prefer travelling\
  \ to meet myself. I like to write poems but that only come up when I try such new\
  \ things in my life and when I have a lot to say about it. \n\nAnd it is true that\
  \ 'In the end we regret only the chances we didn't take.' and I don't want to have\
  \ any of them. I want not only for me but all my family that we should get a chance\
  \ to explore the world by talking to new people, Learning new languages, gaining\
  \ new experiences and capturing them in our hearts. \nBecause moments and memories\
  \ makes life complete, right?"
