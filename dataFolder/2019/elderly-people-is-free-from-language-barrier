Text: "It was a foggy winter day when I was travelling in Hong Kong, early January\
  \ 2019. Yes, it just recently happen, even now I still have remembered how chilled-cold\
  \ wheatear there for me who used to living on warm-hot tropical country, Indonesia.\
  \ I was travelling with my friends but there was a day in Hong Kong I was travelling\
  \ alone. \n\nWhile my friends were spending their time at Hong Kong Disney Land,\
  \ I decided to go around. At night before, my friends asked me where I want to go\
  \ \n for tomorrow and all I knew was I wanted to buy something. The shop located\
  \ in Kwun Tong District, so I went to somewhere before on the same direction.\n\n\
  Going around is not the hardest thing but, doing it alone in foreign country for\
  \ the first time is my biggest concern. I was excited yet afraid and my preparation\
  \ was only started a night before. It was only decided where I wanted to go and\
  \ the best sequence to make the most efficient in cost and time.\n\nAt the morning\
  \ after breakfast, I walked to Kowloon Park. Just walking around the park, take\
  \ some photos, watching several older people doing slow motion exercise. Then, I\
  \ took a bus to Kowloon Walled Park which took around 30 minutes journey. The first\
  \ thing I noticed is the bus was almost empty. After a while it becomes full with\
  \ elderly people which make me curious but also uncomfortable. I sat on the bus;\
  \ of course not at the priority seat just the regular one. \n\nAfter several bus\
  \ stop ahead,  the bus became almost full with elderly, I felt that I need to give\
  \ them my seat. Seeing I was wavering, the older person who seat beside me give\
  \ a sign by her hand that I don\u2019t need to do that. She told me in Cantonese\
  \ with her body language. But believe it or not, the way she spoke and her body\
  \ language made me understand the message she want to me to understand. The way\
  \ she spoke by pointing the others elderly and the priority seat, make me understand\
  \ that she was told me that I did not need to give my seat at the first place if\
  \ I was not seat on the priority seat. \n\nIt was interesting for me. I have a similar\
  \ experience before. The reason I was hesitate to give up my seat because a years\
  \ before in Singapore, I met an older people who refuse my seat, even thought my\
  \ seat is a priority seat.  \u201CI am old but I am healthy lady, I can standing,\
  \ don\u2019t worry\u201D, said her. So for several minutes later everyone was watching\
  \ me sitting on priority seat while in front of me there was a senior resident lady\
  \ standing. Maybe they think how ignorant i am to give a seat. *LoL*. But what can\
  \ I do? She refused.  I also need to respect her choice, even I treated as an ignorance\
  \ one by others. Since then, I became more carefully when I offering something to\
  \ elder people, tried my best not to hurt their pride even it was their privilege.\n\
  \nIn short, I just arrived at Kowloon Walled City Park. It is in the suburb area,\
  \ a quite-nice-historical park. When I was just read the sign post in front of the\
  \ gate, a grandpa said something to me in Cantonese. I just in shock, tried to get\
  \ what he wants to say to me. All I can hear is \u201Cbaba, asdfghj\u2026baba asdfghj\
  \ ...\u201D while he was pointing to somewhere inside of the park. \n\nLooking me\
  \ just silent at my place, he became more insisted that I need to go there right\
  \ now. In confused, I walked inside the park and found out that there is a tour\
  \ guide with a group of middle-aged people that just started the tour inside the\
  \ park. So I guessed that grandpa want me to take that guided tour to get better\
  \ understanding about the historical park. \n\nI went to their group and guess what,\
  \ the tour was guided in Cantonese! OMG!   What should I do?! What should i do?!\
  \ What will you do, guys????"
