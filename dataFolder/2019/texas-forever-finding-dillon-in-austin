Text: "Where\u2019s your big pop culture landmark? Have you dreamt of visiting Middle\
  \ Earth? Maybe you\u2019re dying to pose in front of Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s West\
  \ Village apartment, or perhaps you\u2019ve fancied walking across Abbey Road. Mine\
  \ isn\u2019t in New Zealand, New York or London. It\u2019s actually in the heart\
  \ of Texas\u2014right by Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.\n\nPanthers Fieldhouse\
  \ still stands in front of a football field in tiny Del Valle, Texas. The Fieldhouse\
  \ is in pretty good shape for an abandoned building. The field is unkempt and overgrown,\
  \ but not beyond repair. But this isn\u2019t a regular abandoned football field.\
  \ Panthers Fieldhouse and its adjacent Hermann Field are iconic landmarks from the\
  \ beloved cult small-town high school football drama, Friday Night Lights. Known\
  \ for its catchphrases like \u201CClear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can\u2019t Lose!\u201D\
  \ and \u201CTexas Forever,\u201D it\u2019s my all-time favorite TV show.\nI\u2019\
  d come to Austin, but I was there to find fictional Dillon, Texas. \n\nMy heart\
  \ raced like a teenager in love as I stood before that blue, white and grey athletic\
  \ clubhouse I\u2019d seen dozens of times among Friday Night Lights\u2019 76 episodes.\
  \ I pulled at the locked navy doors, walked around and studied the building\u2019\
  s corners. This was where Dillon\u2019s patriarch, Coach Eric Taylor, gave many\
  \ of his inspirational speeches to his Panthers. It was where all of those twentysomethings-playing-teenagers\
  \ worked out, got changed and bragged about scholarships and girls. \n\nI explored\
  \ the sun-browned grass of the football field, with almost-completely-faded traces\
  \ of big blue Ps. I inspected every detail I could, sweating in the springtime Texas\
  \ sun on the same grounds where my biggest football crushes had. A friendly little\
  \ anole lizard scurried by my shoes. There was life on Hermann Field.\n\nMore pieces\
  \ of Dillon were scattered among greater Austin\u2019s concrete, foliage and drive-thrus.\
  \ The houses of key characters, like the Taylor family and the Riggins brothers.\
  \ Hangouts like Alamo Freeze and Ray\u2019s Bar-B-Q. I didn\u2019t see it all, but\
  \ I saw enough. I\u2019d found Dillon. But my visit proved that Austin had much\
  \ more Dillon beyond its Friday Night Lights landmarks.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find in Austin was its own small-town charm. The strangers who smiled and looked\
  \ me in the eye. The woman on South Congress who held up her dog wearing sunglasses,\
  \ asking if I wanted a photo. The chatty new pal I made at a drag show who introduced\
  \ himself to me as, \u201CTurner, like Tina!\u201D The cashier who said his favorite\
  \ thing about Canada was The Kids in the Hall. \n\nWhile finding Dillon, a little\
  \ girl popped her head out of the front door of the little white house where Panthers\
  \ quarterback, Matt Saracen, had lived with his sweet grandmother. \n\n\u201CYou\
  \ can come up on the porch to take pictures!\u201D she exclaimed, \u201CPeople come\
  \ here all the time!\u201D\n\nThis little Austin girl was Dillon, through and through.\n\
  \nWhen I re-watch episodes of Friday Night Lights, I notice the Austin in Dillon.\
  \ I know that Vince Howard\u2019s apartment complex is on East Caesar Chavez street.\
  \ That the Riggins brothers\u2019 house is just down the street from the Taylor\
  \ family\u2019s. When I watch now, I pay attention to the planes flying low out\
  \ of Austin-Bergstrom from Hermann Field, on their way to Frankfurt, to Cancun or\
  \ maybe up here to Toronto. And from time to time, I expect to see that little Austin\
  \ girl greeting Matt Saracen on his porch after his shift at Alamo Freeze.\n\nWhenever\
  \ I hear an Earle, Steve or Justin Townes, I remember the wild succulents and the\
  \ dust in the springtime breeze.  Whenever I hear Selena\u2019s \u201CComo la Flor,\u201D\
  \ I remember the loose pet chickens down the street from my rented Airstream trailer\
  \ and the friendly orange cat in the yard. And whenever I hear Bright Eyes\u2019\
  \ version of \u201CDevil Town,\u201D I think about Panthers Fieldhouse in front\
  \ of my clear eyes on that sunny spring day. \n\n\u201CTexas Forever\u201D has become\
  \ more than just a catchphrase from a drunk hunk on TV. Texas Forever is my heart\
  \ full from unexpectedly finding the Dillon in Austin. And that\u2019s a feeling\
  \ I can\u2019t lose."
