Text: "It was only when I shuffled into the hostel the next morning, holding my remaining\
  \ sandal, and the receptionist gasped audibly, that I realised how I must look.\
  \ My white shorts were smeared with blood; my top lip was split to just under my\
  \ nose. \u201CEstoy bien,\u201D I said thickly, although I obviously wasn\u2019\
  t fine. \u201CAsaltadores.\u201D I had learned the Spanish for \u201Cmuggers\u201D\
  \ in the back of the police car; Malaga, in Andalucia, is heavily touristed, but\
  \ these cops either didn\u2019t know, or weren\u2019t interested in speaking, English.\
  \ \n\tI was a few weeks in to my first solo backpacking trip, and had just arrived\
  \ from grey, clammy Ireland. I\u2019d spent the evening sampling the local fino\
  \ sherry and practicing my Spanish with the barman. Weaving back through narrow\
  \ streets, I realised I was lost, and, sensing danger, called my boyfriend in Australia\
  \ to tell him I didn\u2019t know where I was. \u201CWalk towards the light,\u201D\
  \ he said. The alley opened onto a plaza; I recognized its cast-iron lamps. \u201C\
  I know where I am!\u201D I said. \u201CI\u2019ll be fine from here.\u201D It was\
  \ shortly after I hung up that the two men appeared, demanded my bag, and, when\
  \ I refused, punched me\u2014hard\u2014in the face. I woke in the back of the police\
  \ car, my bag and one shoe missing. The night passed, first in the police station,\
  \ where I gave a statement in incoherent Spanish; and then in the hospital, where\
  \ I dozed on plastic chairs, waiting for x-rays. Nothing was broken.\n\tAfter waking\
  \ to an oppressive mid-afternoon heat, I decided that before facing the phone calls\
  \ to the bank, insurers, and credit card companies, I would clear my head with a\
  \ swim. I took my aching body to the beach, where I used the coins I found at the\
  \ bottom of my backpack to buy my first meal in twenty-four hours. As I sat eating\
  \ thick slices of ripe, juicy tomatoes and shards of sweet onion dressed with sharp\
  \ wine vinegar, olive oil, and sea salt, I felt the shock of the night before already\
  \ receding into memory. All I\u2019d really lost was some cash, an iPod, and my\
  \ sandals. Soon I would be in Seville.\n\tI returned from my swim feeling grateful\
  \ to be alive, towelled off, and sank into the sand. \nThat\u2019s when I remembered\
  \ my passport.\nIt was the only valuable I had left. All my cash, travellers checks,\
  \ and cards were gone. It was also the only thing that would prove my identity.\
  \ Terrified of losing it, I had taken it to the beach rather than leave it in the\
  \ dorm, and buried it in an inch of sand underneath my towel while I swam. I jumped\
  \ up and whipped away the towel, searching for a glimpse of blue canvas. Had I even\
  \ put the towel down in the same place? I dropped to my knees and started scrabbling\
  \ with shaking hands. My heart pounded; I couldn\u2019t breathe. Ever since, when\
  \ I experience panic, I go right back to that beach, and the sensation of terror\
  \ rising like bile in my throat. Soon hot, helpless tears were stinging the cuts\
  \ on my face as I searched the sand through blurry vision. It was gone. \n\tThen\
  \ I realised that someone was talking to me. A group of young Germans had paused\
  \ their volleyball game; two of them patted my back while I gulped my way through\
  \ the story. \n\u201CSplit up!\u201D said one of them suddenly. \u201CMake a grid.\u201D\
  \ He turned to me. \u201CHow far could it have gone?\u201D I gestured hopelessly:\
  \ not far, I think? He turned and spoke to the group, and, as I watched, they spread\
  \ out, shouting directions. In the sand, with their feet and hands, they drew a\
  \ grid, about ten metres by ten metres. Each person painstakingly sifted through\
  \ a square of sand, crossing them off as they went. I couldn\u2019t quite believe\
  \ what I was seeing; a miracle of Teutonic efficiency. Suddenly, one of them gave\
  \ a shout. He was grinning, holding up a blue rectangle, while his friends cheered.\
  \ \u201CI didn\u2019t expect to find it,\u201D he said, and handed me my passport.\
  \ \u201CWe are very lucky.\u201D"
