Text: "Lisbon stretched facing her eyes under a bright blue sky and the characteristic\
  \ saltpeter\u2019s smell that overwhelmed her nose wherever she moved. The Tajo\
  \ river flowed, peaceful and mighty until arrive to the great delta that would connect\
  \ it to the ocean, being an eternal witness of this embrace April 25 Bridge. It\
  \ was a really iconic picture. \n\n\u201CExcuse me, could you take us a picture?\u201D\
  \ She asked a tourist who was walking around.\n \n\u201CWho else?\u201D the intrigued\
  \ man asked with his cell phone already in his hand. \u201CIf you are only one here.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re right, excuse me, I\u2019m not used to travel alone\u201D\
  . She apologized feeling embarrassed. \n\nThat man accepted her explanation, photographed\
  \ her with the framing that he considered the most appropriate and said goodbye\
  \ to her with a smile. Xana Coto, meanwhile, turned around the direction of the\
  \ spectacular view that that lookout offered her while watching the photos that\
  \ she had done before.\n\n\u201CRemember you are traveling alone through Portugal,\
  \ it is the third time it happens to you.\u201D \n\nShe looked at her companion\
  \ who smiled at her continual confusions. Maxin was a ventolin, a pixie from her\
  \ birthplace, Asturias, a friend of her childhood who could only be seen by those\
  \ with the gift of magic like her. She had decided to take him to that trip to give\
  \ him the chance to know the world and sometimes she forgot that he was invisible\
  \ to others. She showed him the pictures in which just them were able to see that\
  \ little reflected creature and then, they remained silent enjoying that spectacle\
  \ and the warm caress of the sun.\n\n\u201CToday is our last day in Lisbon, is there\
  \ anything left to see?\u201D Maxin asked approaching to her ear in order to be\
  \ discreet.\n\nShe stared at the figure of the S\xE9 Cathedral of Lisbon glimpsing\
  \ the sky before answering.\n\n\u201CThere is something left, but only you and I\
  \ will be able to see it.\u201D\n\nThey both looked at each other as if they were\
  \ understanding what she was talking about and they left to go to the previous mentioned\
  \ cathedral. They entered into it and lost themselves in the temple looking for\
  \ a secluded and silent place.\n\nThey found a small chapel closed to the visitors\
  \ and they mocked the chaplain's vigilance to hide in it.\n\nThen Xana pulled a\
  \ wooden wand from her purse and a piece of amber that she had around her neck before\
  \ saying.\n\n\u201CMaxin, hold on to me.\u201D\n\nAfter the slight movement of her\
  \ hand, the wand settled on the piece of mineral, illuminating and projecting an\
  \ intense orange light that was reflected in all the walls. Then everything started,\
  \ the place began to spin and Xana had to tightly hold on to the wall for not being\
  \ shoot off, she knew that in a few seconds everything would cease and she maintained\
  \ her composure.\n\nAnd it was fulfilled. All those turbulences went by and she\
  \ felt again the solid ground under her body.\n\n\u201CI think we have arrived,\
  \ Maxin\u201D. She said, keeping her wand in her purse and sneaking out of the chapel.\n\
  \nThey left the church without running into anyone and they smiled when they discovered\
  \ what was in front of them. The rails and the electric system of the tram had disappeared\
  \ and the road had changed into a path of stones and mud.\n\n\u201CCome on, Maxin.\
  \ I want to show you something\u201D. It was all she said before started running\
  \ up the hill of Alfama.\n\nShe took her little friend to the lookout where they\
  \ had been before and discovered that it was no longer there and, instead, there\
  \ was just the edge of a sturdy wall. They looked out and what they saw left them\
  \ open-mouthed.\n\nThe Commerce\u2019s Square was not there anymore either, but\
  \ the Royal Palace and the National Library were raised instead. Nothing seemed\
  \ like it used to before.\n\n\u201CIn what century are we, Xana?\u201D. Maxin asked\
  \ impressed.\n\n\u201CSeptember 1755, if I'm not mistaken\u201D. She answered while\
  \ she switched off her now useless phone in her purse and they remained silent contemplating\
  \ that unique view."
