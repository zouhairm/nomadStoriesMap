Text: "\u201CZzzziiiiippppp\u201D, I closed the zipper of my bag, for one final time.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t a regular bag filled with clothes, shoes, food etc. It was a special\
  \ bag, filled with dreams, fears, excitement, nervousness and love from the dear\
  \ one\u2019s. That feeling when you don\u2019t know what will happen next, but all\
  \ you know is something might happen and you are excited to know what it would be,\
  \ yes, that feeling was deep inside my belly. Well, I was leaving my country to\
  \ pursue something different - I had got a job opportunity in Germany\u2019s capital,\
  \ Berlin. And coming from an Indian middle class family, relocating far away in\
  \ a different continent, is sure tough. Especially, when you have never been outside\
  \ India before. \n\nI waved my hand one final time to my parents, from the airport\u2019\
  s glassdoor. I could clearly see my mom crying, and her tears made my heart sink\
  \ deep. But at the same time, the excitement of going to a different world, and\
  \ doing something that I\u2019ve never done in my life, kept me alive. \n\nIt wasn\u2019\
  t a regular flight. It was a flight to the unknown. Unknown people, unknown place\
  \ and unknown situation. My first stop, outside India, was Abu Dhabi. Usually, when\
  \ you travel to the known locations and you peep outside the window when the flight\
  \ is landing, you could easily guess how the scene would look like. The roads, buildings,\
  \ rivers look familiar. But this was different. I, with an excitement of a kid,\
  \ peeped outside the window to see how the new world looks like. There was an infinite\
  \ desert with man-made roads amidst it, a perfect view of how man has stabbed nature.\
  \  \n\nThe moment I landed, it was a breath of a different air. The first thing\
  \ I noticed was the people. Since I\u2019ve never been outside India, I haven\u2019\
  t seen so many non-brown people. There were men standing 6 feet tall, babies with\
  \ blue eyes, and women with blonde hairs. There were people talking in a Hollywood\
  \ style english accent, different than the regular Indian English accent. It was\
  \ a different world, which I\u2019ve read in books and seen in movies, but never\
  \ in real life. I took a deep breath, for the feeling to sink in, that I was in\
  \ a different country. \n\nAfter a couple of hours of staring at this new world,\
  \ I set on my second flight to the final destination, Berlin. The flight was meant\
  \ to be for 8 hours. I have never been on such a long flight, but the elation of\
  \ what\u2019s on the other side, kept me interested during the entire flight. I\
  \ thanked the person who wrote the algorithm for assigning a seat, because I for\
  \ sure was beaming with joy sitting on my window seat. Almost the entire flight,\
  \ I caught myself staring outside the window, looking at the marvellous cloudless\
  \ sky and its serene white and blue color. After almost, 8 hours of over-thinking\
  \ how my new world would look like, how the people would be, and how will I manage\
  \ living in a different continent, a familiar voice announced \u201CCrew, ready\
  \ for landing\u201D. This was it. I knew, the time has come. Only if there was a\
  \ heart rate monitor, one could see my heart beating with a speed of Usain Bolt.\
  \ \u201CShkeeeeewwwwww\u201D, the plane finally arrived and stood still. I stood\
  \ up, picked my bag and started walking on the Aisle, towards the exit. I was curious\
  \ to see the new world in real, this time. The moment, I got outside the aircraft,\
  \ I saw something that I never experienced in my life before. There were small,\
  \ soft, white pieces of ice that were falling from the sky forming a white layer\
  \ on the ground, telling me \u201CAniket, Welcome to a New World\u201D. Dictionary\
  \ defines it as \u201CSnow\u201D. But I define it as, \u201CMagic\u201D. At the\
  \ risk of being considered as weird and dumb by people around me, I held the magic\
  \ in my hand, touched it, felt it, kissed it and loved it. And I said to myself\
  \ \u201CWhat a Wonderful World\u201D."
