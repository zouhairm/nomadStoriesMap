Text: "All I had to do was look up from my chip-filled burger and make eye contact.\
  \ Easy, physically. Mentally, torture. They were gypsy kids. That\u2019s what everyone\
  \ called them. Not these two, specifically, but any children with olive skin, begging\
  \ for change around the cafes, lakeside. Ohrid, Macedonia was not short of street\
  \ beggars, like any country. \nToday, I\u2019d made the great triumph of leaving\
  \ the apartment and deciding to venture out alone. My family had planned other activities\
  \ that didn\u2019t intrigue me. I\u2019d planned to spend the day reading my book\
  \ and eating whatever fruits were picked from my grandma\u2019s village garden.\
  \ Three weeks in Macedonia thus far, and shamefully, almost half that time was spent\
  \ indoors. A force, also known as hunger pushed me to leave, in search of a proper\
  \ lunch. Knowing the simple path to the city square, I found myself sitting by a\
  \ food truck, four bites into my burger.\n\u201CMoney? Pari? Money, please.\u201D\
  \ Over and over, louder and louder, the two beggar children made their way through\
  \ the people. Perhaps, seeing a 14-year-old, was the reason they\u2019d skipped\
  \ me. They sat on the stone cobbled path and began to laugh. Eye contact is the\
  \ first step. I repeated the phrase, that was slowly becoming my mantra. My stomach\
  \ kicked itself with butterflies as I felt anxious at the thought of communicating\
  \ with these strangers. I stood up and walked over to the two kids who fell silent.\n\
  \u201CMoney? Pari for burger?\u201D The \u2018r\u2019 sounds rolling, as I imitated\
  \ and butchered a European accent. The older of the two smiled and stood. Taller\
  \ than me but surely younger. He put his hands out ready for the gift. \u201CNo,\
  \ I\u2019ll buy, uh\u2026 platam the burger.\u201D It was as if I had lost my ability\
  \ to speak this second language I was raised on. Macedonian flew out the window\
  \ and my nerves nestled in. The boy, seemed surprised but understood, walking over\
  \ to the food truck. Buying food went to them; money could end up anywhere. Within\
  \ a minute he\u2019d ordered and was waving me over to pay.\nThe younger girl joined\
  \ us and waited with wide, hungry eyes for the burger that was sizzling a few feet\
  \ away. Burgers were received and my good deed and brief interaction with other\
  \ humans was over. I smiled and gave an awkwardly, stiff nod, before turning to\
  \ walk away. A hand grabbed my wrist and I locked onto the girl\u2019s marble, green\
  \ eyes. \u201CCome.\u201D She said, tugging at me, before following her friend.\
  \ What else could I possibly do in a foreign country, alone and young but to follow\
  \ these two strangers? And so, I did.\nWithin seconds, we were surrounded by the\
  \ white brick and stone that paved the alley and little houses all over Ohrid. We\
  \ were on an incline heading deeper into an area I didn\u2019t know. \n\u201CI\u2019\
  m Lilyana.\u201D They turned, not hearing my quiet attempt at communication. \u201C\
  Lilyana.\u201D I repeated.\n\u201CI am Ivan, she is Marta.\u201D And on we went.\
  \ They ate their burgers, looked over their shoulders with smiles at me and repeated\
  \ for almost 10 minutes. The narrow street became lively with laughter and music.\
  \  Exotic food sat cooking while cloths flowing with colour were draped overhead.\
  \ The sun beamed over and through them, colours and light dancing on the white brick\
  \ and stone. I was immersed in this intense explosion of colour, sound and smell.\
  \ Marta locked arms with me and we laughed as we ducked under a low hanging cloth.\
  \ A slight burst in our step was made to balance the speed of the street. Around,\
  \ under, faster and faster; laughing and holding our burgers up high. \nWe made\
  \ it to the top of a hill, overlooking one side of the lake and cafes that floated\
  \ over the water. We watched the sunset reflect over the untouched lake to the sounds\
  \ of a live band echoing from a distant caf\xE9. After two hours of poorly translated\
  \ jokes and country comparisons we walked back down through the once bustling street.\
  \ By the food truck we parted ways with a smile and shared memories between an Australian,\
  \ Macedonian and two hungry gypsy kids."
