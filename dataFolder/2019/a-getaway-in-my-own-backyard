Text: "Growing up in Australia, I was always aware of how beautiful people would find\
  \ my country. In Australia you are never far from the tropical rainforests or the\
  \ golden beaches; however, I must admit that, personally, I certainly took this\
  \ all for granted. \nThis realisation only came to me when I had met and befriended\
  \ South American international students whilst they were studying in Australia.\n\
  \nEach week I would meet them and  they would tell me about how they would travel\
  \ to places like the Gold Coast, to Melbourne, or to Byron, and they would proceed\
  \ to show me their recent Instagram photos and all the memories they made on their\
  \ trip. \u2018Wow\u2019, I thought, \u2018they are taking advantage of living in\
  \ this beautiful country and seeing the diverse beauty we have here.\u2019 Through\
  \ their experiences, I was able to see my country slightly differently.\nSo, not\
  \ wanting to miss out on the opportunities that were always in front of me, I decided\
  \ to spontaneously have a 2 night getaway to Noosa Heads on Queensland\u2019s Sunshine\
  \ Coast. \n\nSpeechless.\n\nThat\u2019s the word that comes to mind. \n\nTo think\
  \ that this beautiful place was always so close to me, and yet I was only just now\
  \ acknowledging how incredibly beautiful it was, it\u2019s baffling. My eyes weren\u2019\
  t the only thing seeing something new, but my experiences were also changing. The\
  \ rainforest walk was no longer just a a 3 hour exercise. Nope! It had transformed\
  \ into an exploration of the biodiveristy that Australia has. To look and appreciate\
  \ the flora the fauna and the views of nature. Laying on the beach was not just\
  \ good for my tan, but now it became a place where I can appreciate hearing the\
  \ waves crashing on the shore and feeling the heat of the sun warm me from head\
  \ to toe. \n\nIt\u2019s like I had started to see this country through the eyes\
  \ of someone who was experiencing it for the first time. I was looking at details\
  \ of everything around me. The simple blue water was now glistening. The people\
  \ around me had individual features and stories and were no longer just strangers\
  \ from another town. I became a tourist in my own country and gained new experiences\
  \ from an otherwise routine trip to the seaside. \n\nSuddenly, it was like I was\
  \ living in a new world. The beauty became evident when I realised how lucky I was\
  \ to live in such a beautiful country. My view changed so quickly and how glad I\
  \ am that this was so. Now, whenever I do have time, I\u2019m always packing up\
  \ to go somewhere new in my own state. I never want to take advantage of living\
  \ here by brushing off my surroundings as \u2018nothing new\u2019, but rather I\
  \ am going to take advantage by travelling as much as I can and sharing not-to-miss\
  \ experiences with whoever else is interested.\n\nAnd you can be sure that whenever\
  \ the topic of travel arises, I will always be one to recommend Noosa as the place\
  \ to go."
