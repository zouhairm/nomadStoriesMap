Text: "The queue of people wound down the noisy street full of vendors and foodstalls.\
  \ It overflowed off the sidewalk and was now blocking traffic. It was as if they\
  \ were lining up for tickets for a rock  band. I pushed my way through to get a\
  \ look at what was happening. Who was so famous to cause all this ruckus? As I drew\
  \ near I could finally see what was happening. I had forgotten. I was in Cuba, and\
  \ this was the line to buy internet access cards!\n\nLong before the Bay of Pigs,\
  \ the Cuban government monitored what information came into and out of the country.\
  \ The global boom in social networking, access to myriad gaming apps and daily business\
  \ communications have proven somewhat of a challenge to the Cuban authorities. They\
  \ know that Cuba needs to be connected to the outside world beyond its six TV channels\
  \ if it is going to develop. But they also recognise that untethered access to the\
  \ internet could bring in more than they\u2019re ready to deal with. Enter the internet\
  \ access card. \n\nFor one Cuban CUC the local phone company Etecsa, will sell you\
  \ a one hour card which will allow you to access the internet at a variety of public\
  \ hotspots around town. As you can imagine one hour online goes almost nowhere which\
  \ is why there is a constant stream of both local and international customers to\
  \ buy cards. To make it even more interesting Cuba embraces a two currency  monetary\
  \ system as many transitioning socialist nations do, one for foreign visitors and\
  \ another for locals. But never fear, the draw of the free market is a live and\
  \ well in Cuba and soon saw wheeling and dealing locals buying bulk cards and selling\
  \ them to visitors at double the price or more. But somehow it works, and at least\
  \ you don\u2019t have to line up outside the phone company thinking a major celebrity\
  \ is in town.\n\nNeedless to say we went for option B and bought an internet card\
  \ from Garcia, a local wheeler dealer who had travelled abroad and spoke  good English.\
  \ He had married abroad some years before but had returned to Cuba to break into\
  \ the burgeoning phone card business. I asked Garcia how one recognised one was\
  \ in a hotspot as there was very little signage. He said you just need to watch\
  \ people and when you see everyone focusing on their phones then it\u2019s almost\
  \ certain you are in a hotspot area. \n\nTrue to his word, Garcia led us to a little\
  \ park where you might typically  see children playing football, teenagers throwing\
  \ a frisbee, some dogs playing fetch and maybe even a kite or two. But here everyone\
  \ in the park was glued to their phones and looked intense. This was clearly a hotspot!\
  \ So that\u2019s the internet Cuban style. However, as we speak, there is talk of\
  \ an impending election and guess which issue is high on the agenda for many in\
  \ the electorate \u2013 yes you guessed it \u2013 internet access!\n\nOf course,\
  \ never to be outdone, Garcia like many Cuban entrepreneurs has his fingers in several\
  \ pies. Because we were now friends by virtue of our spurious internet card transaction,\
  \ he now felt compelled to inform us of his other  businesses \u2013 in fine Cuban\
  \ dining - and wanted to escort us to his restaurant. We finally agree and after\
  \ wandering through a labrynth of back streets and lanes we reach a tiny doorway\
  \ where he warns us we must be ready for a steep ascent. Actually the ascent wasn\u2019\
  t bad at all. I just hoped it wasn\u2019t  leading to a  local gang hangout who\
  \ were simply firing up their own griddle for a late batch of breakfast burrito\u2019\
  s!\n\nAfter several levels of tightly winding stairs we eventually arrived at the\
  \ rooftop, which, to Garcia\u2019s credit, was genuinely a fascinating, traditional\
  \ seafood restaurant packed with foreign visitors. I wondered if they too had bought\
  \ internet cards and had arrived via the hotspot park, but most seemed too taken\
  \ by the romantic Cuban atmosphere to be bothered, even if they had. This was a\
  \ definite win for the Havana entrepreneurs!"
