Text: My first holiday was with my sister Kim and flow alone to Knysna and it was
  my first in a plane full of whites since their drive and I couldn't make it. Since
  we in the New Years of democracy in South Africa and racial act we're happening
  every week, I had my own fears of being in a plane but thanks the cabin brew that
  made my 1 hour 45 mi trip pleasurable and again Knysna is breath only whites and
  we make our staying fun!! Seeing the lagoon and the beach for the first time I didn't
  wanna leave and be pumped with massages and most importantly breakfast was delicious
  and since then I made sure I have the same breakfast from the hotel. After few days,
  we drove to Cape Town wow! Wow! Wow! The side seen I was taking picture using my
  old phone Nokia that was stolen in Cape Town with all those memories "crying". We
  visited Table mountain and spend the day on top of the mountain which was my firs
  time, went to the theme park and visited the lion's peak to see where both oceans
  Indian and Atlantic oceans meetings and produce a string to show which one is!!
  That was amazing. Lunching at Sea point and eating sea food only never got tight.
  Eish, this make me crave sea food. Visited some of the local resturant in the townships
  and coloured areas and have local food was again beyond my expectation. If I have
  enough money I woul do that again but not in Cape Town but somewhere else.
