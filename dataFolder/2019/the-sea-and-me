Text: "I was a Caribbean Sea virgin when I arrived in St. Lucia. From the moment the\
  \ island came into view,  its abundantly lush rainforests and tantalising turquoise\
  \ water called to me like a siren song.\n\n   I had the romantic notion that for\
  \ my first foray into tropical waters, I would dramatically frolic and splash my\
  \ way into bliss. That beautiful sea did not share my enthusiasm, and upon my near\
  \ return to shore she rewarded my hubris with a wave that sent me tumbling. In the\
  \ directionless chaos, I lost my prescription glasses.\n\n   I abashedly (and quite\
  \ respectfully) waded onto shore, and promptly went to the front desk of the hotel\
  \ to query if there were any eye-wear stores that would be able to help  with my\
  \ sudden lack of vision. My heart nearly leapt out of my chest when it was shared\
  \ that glasses cost around $2000... downtrodden, I made my way back to my room.\
  \ Hand on the doorknob, it occurred to me that that price probably wasn't in American\
  \ dollars. Needless to say, I was elated to find out that it was in fact the price\
  \ in Eastern Caribbean dollars!\n\n   Lisa, the friendly and extremely helpful concierge,\
  \ immediately jumped on the phone and was able to get me an appointment at a shop\
  \ in Rodney Bay. I departed immediately for the appointment on what can only be\
  \ described as one of the greatest of many surprising and delightful adventures\
  \ on this beautiful island.\n\n   The buses in St. Lucia are an ABSOLUTE must do!\
  \ For well under $1(US), this mode of transportation allows you a sliver of insight\
  \ on what everyday life is like for St. Lucians.\n\n    A passenger van will whip\
  \ up to your stop and a fellow passenger will slide open the door and in you climb.\
  \ As the scenery goes zooming past, you catch snippets of conversation about the\
  \ events of the day, and even some gossip. Children in school uniforms hop in, curious\
  \ to see the tourists in the thick of their friends and neighbours. The thrill of\
  \ this ride, other than the speed of the driver, is that you have to yell very loudly\
  \ \"Driver, stop please\" a minute or so before your stop. This allows time for\
  \ the driver to slow down in time for the stop.\n\n   Rodney Bay is a quaint town\
  \ that houses some international banks and businesses, as well as locally owned\
  \ stores. Unfortunately for me, my love of shopping would have to wait. My immediate\
  \ concern was the appointment, and not missing another moment of the beauty around\
  \ me. I found the shop, and after sharing the sea story (to the amusement of the\
  \ owner) and having an eye exam, we came to the conclusion that they would not be\
  \ able to have glasses ready for three or four days.\n\n   In a flash, the owner\
  \ of the store was on the phone with a fellow optometrist and I was sent around\
  \ the corner to be fitted with glasses that would be ready later that day. \n\n\
  \   Half a day and two bus rides later, I was able to really take in the magnificence\
  \ that surrounded me. The kindness that was shown to me by everyone I came in to\
  \ contact with only amplified my appreciation for this multi-faceted island. Where\
  \ else can you go that has a drive through volcano, vast rainforests, white sandy\
  \ beaches, cocoa plantations, and The Pitons (majestic inactive volcanoes that are\
  \ a must experience for hikers!).\n   \n   The first order of business upon returning\
  \ to the hotel was to go down to the beach and make amends with the sea. As I gingerly\
  \ stepped into the water, into her warm and gentle embrace, I knew that all had\
  \ been forgiven. I had found a place out in this great wide world that felt safe\
  \ and cosy, as if it were home away from home."
