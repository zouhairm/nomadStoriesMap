Text: "There is very little that compares to the anticipation of a new stamp on a\
  \ passport. With every click of the ink pressing to paper, my heart beats a little\
  \ faster imaging the people I will meet, the new flavors I will indulge in and the\
  \ time tested architecture that will forever inspire me. No, it's not really about\
  \ the stamp at all, is it?\n\nClark and I were deep in that anticipation beginning\
  \ our South East Asia backpacking trip. It was an anticipation that we had carried\
  \ through our last year of working in South Korea as ESL teachers. We now boarded\
  \ the first of 11 flights in our journey, and Bali was our opening act. \n\nWith\
  \ an undefined number of days ahead of us, the less we spent, the longer we could\
  \ keep the dream alive! Blue Ocean Hostel tucked just off the humble town of Seminyak\u2019\
  s main beach strip was the perfect fit. It boasted individual villas with terracotta\
  \ floors and outdoor showers, while surrounded by rich vegetative privacy. It met\
  \ the street with a surf hut. The rates for hourly rentals and lessons had been\
  \ painted in friendly colors, by an even friendlier, smiling surfer \u201Cdude\u201D\
  . He walked us back through a winding path to our very own oasis. We were giddy.\
  \ \n\nJust a few steps away the beach was lined with restaurants serving tacos,\
  \ fresh fruit, noodles, and smoothies. A waiter joked with us that they moved all\
  \ the restaurants to the beach just so you could order with no shoes. Looking down\
  \ at our sandals we laughed; shoes were almost as foreign as us in this town.\n\n\
  Bali welcomed us that night with the most beautiful sky. The kind of sunset that\
  \ softens your brow, invites you to pause with complete gratitude for life and makes\
  \ you inhale so deeply you can feel it in your toes. \n\nEverything seemed perfect.\
  \ Everything was - that is until the sun went down. \n\nExhausted from packing up\
  \ our lives in South Korea and finding our way to the present, we headed to our\
  \ hostel for a couple of Bingtangs and some early shut-eye.  \n\nAround 9:30 PM\
  \ we were startled awake by a loud BANG. Hearts pounding and mouths still, our eyes\
  \ met abruptly in fear. Was that a gunshot? A second, and then a third came. It\
  \ was nearby. I turned my gaze slowly to the open window louvers,  panicking I whispered:\
  \ \u201CClark, get on the floor!\u201D.  And then utter silence.\n\nSo many thoughts\
  \ ran through my mind while we pressed our bodies to the cool tile. Should we get\
  \ our passports in case we need to run? Should we already be running? What if running\
  \ gets us shot? What if waiting gets us shot? I thought of the dense vegetation\
  \ outside and all it could hide. Every bad story about traveling in Asia flashed\
  \ through my mind. We both trembled, fingers too far to touch.\n\nThree hours passed\
  \ before we decided to peel ourselves off the floor, and back into our bed. Neither\
  \ of us slept. Come morning we were so reluctant to leave for fear of what we would\
  \ find outside our hostel doors. When we finally did, people were going about their\
  \ business as usual. No dead bodies. No police investigating.  Was this normal?\
  \      \n\nWe couldn\u2019t stay here again. \n\nShaky and unassured we chose to\
  \ drown our worries in the sunshine while deciding our next move. We felt so unsafe\
  \ in a place that had been bliss just yesterday. \n\nThat night we found ourselves\
  \ eating dinner a few doors down from Blue Ocean. Albeit full of great local food\
  \ options, Seminyak was only so big. \n\nIt was during our first few bites that\
  \ we heard it again. BANG! Looking up from my plate, I saw a rusty bright yellow\
  \ moped backfiring ONE, delay, TWO, THREE times before the driver took off, waving\
  \ to a friend on the way.\n\nClark and I burst into tears of laughter and relief.\
  \  One tick off the naive South East Asia backpacker list, we went back to the Blue\
  \ and checked in for another 2 nights."
