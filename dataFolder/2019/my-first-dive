Text: "After three grueling days of classroom and pool training overlooking the white\
  \ sand, I thought I was ready for my first dive in the open ocean. I had no idea\
  \ I would be in mortal danger.\n      We left the quiet harbor of Koh Tao, Thailand\
  \ at 6 A.M. towards Sail Rock, a premier dive site in Thailand. The ride was horrendous\
  \ despite being only an hour. The air was humid from a recent rainstorm, and a gray\
  \ fog lingered on the shore. Big waves rocked the boat violently as the beautiful\
  \ island faded over the horizon.\n      Due to the rain, the water's visibility\
  \ had decreased from 15 meters to 2. I was given Dramamine for seasickness, but\
  \ I still vomited while Marius, my blond German guide was getting my gear ready.\
  \ My head spun, and I couldn't walk straight on the shaky slick floor of the dive\
  \ boat. I put on my wetsuit backward, then fell repeatedly while putting on the\
  \ flippers. I went to the bathroom and purged again.\n     \"Are you okay?\" Marius\
  \ asked.\n     \"Never been better,\" I replied. I finished gearing up and went\
  \ to the edge of the boat. I held the railing and heaved more fish food.\n     \"\
  Rough conditions today,\" Marius chuckled.\n     \"I'm ready,\" I groaned.\n   \
  \  I put my goggles over my eyes and the oxygen regulator in my acidic mouth. I\
  \ jumped off after Marius and almost lost it again on the breach.\n     \"We dive\
  \ 5 meters and practice skills,\" Marius said.\n      As we made our descent, I\
  \ couldn't see more than a meter in front of me. The wakes from our boat pushed\
  \ us where they pleased as we flipped our flippers to our own dismay. We descended\
  \ deeper into a sandy milkshake, and I lost the view of the entire surface world.\
  \ All I could hear was my breath. We tried to practice, but between the wakes and\
  \ current, we couldn't coordinate with each other. Sand particles and fish poop\
  \ bounced off my dive mask, but I caught glorious glimpses of sea life through my\
  \ leaky goggles-huge schools of fish, elegant reefs, and wildlife suspended in chaotic\
  \ harmony. I knew what I was seeing was marvelous. I wanted to gaze longer, but\
  \ I struggled to keep Marius in view.\n      Another strong current swept through,\
  \ and although we kicked hard, we couldn't win. I checked my oxygen levels. 80 of\
  \ 200 bar. \n     \"Don't go below 50 bar, especially your first dives,\" Marius\
  \ said in training. \"That is air for emergency reserves.\" We headed into a rock\
  \ tunnel, the entry barely wide enough for us to fit. Our bodies pressed through\
  \ thin walls, pulsing with aquatic life. Dozens of tiny organisms perched curiously\
  \ all around. I floated over multicolored anemones and coral as if I was flying.\
  \ The closer I observed, the more the ocean echoed emptiness. Marius had vanished.\
  \ \n     Just breathe.\n     My air being vacuumed, my reserves in rapid use, I\
  \ tried to remember how to decompress. As panic set in, I used more and more oxygen\
  \ trying to find Marius. What was the emergency ascent skill? I crawled through\
  \ the tunnel exit as two buck-toothed barracuda zipped in, chasing the squiggle\
  \ of an eel. I checked my oxygen again. 10 of 100 bar. I made a solemn promise to\
  \ recycle and avoid all plastic and save the whales if the ocean would just let\
  \ me live.\n\tMy tank on fumes, I saw a dark shape and kicked up. With a last-ditch\
  \ effort, I inflated my vest with the last of my oxygen. As water filled my goggles,\
  \ I lost vision and burst through the surface only to smack my head on metal. I\
  \ lay there like plankton, unresponsive, bordering on shock, before being dragged\
  \ away. Marius pulled me up on a boat and held an orange inflated tube labeled emergency.\
  \ \n     \"Congratulations,\" he said, panting, showing me a casual thumb up. \"\
  You pass the skills test.\" I leaned over and threw up a fourth time. I noticed\
  \ we were rescued by a completely different boat. It had been a sickening, fearful\
  \ experience. I had almost died and yet, strangely, I'd never felt more alive.\n\
  \     \"When can we go again?\" I asked."
