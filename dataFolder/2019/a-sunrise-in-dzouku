Text: "In December 2017, a friend and I trekked to Dzouku Valley in Nagaland. Dzouku\
  \ Valley straddles the border of Nagaland and Manipur in North-East India. The more\
  \ convenient route is via Nagaland, where once again there are two entry points,\
  \ both of which are accessible from the city of Kohima.\nThe entry from the village\
  \ of Jakhama is extremely steep and best left to seasoned trekkers with guides,\
  \ whilst that from the village of Viswema, which is the one we took, is challenging\
  \ for the first hour as one climbs up the steep hill, but soon opens out into the\
  \ winding roads of the valley. While the place is the same, every season the valley\
  \ is wrapped in a different aesthetic from the lush green flowery mounds in the\
  \ summer when camping is rampant, to the saturated tones of the winter when frost\
  \ envelops the valley in intricate designs on bamboo leaves. \nAfter a trek through\
  \ bamboo, rhododendrons, and stumps of trees sculpted and blackened by lightening,\
  \ filling our eyes with open azure skies and rolling emerald mounds, we reached\
  \ our destination: the rest house. This is the only place to stay in Dzouku Valley,\
  \ is run by the Mountaineering Club of Nagaland, and comprises two large hangar-like\
  \ sheds where you can sleep with mattresses or sleeping bags that you\u2019ve (hopefully!)\
  \ brought. There is not a whiff of civilisation in the valley apart from this rest-house,\
  \ where 3-4 members of the Angami tribe stay, cook simple meals and help guests\
  \ who visit the valley. In the local folklore, it is said that the spirits of ancestors\
  \ occupy valleys where there is no echo, and there is no echo in Dzouku Valley.\
  \ \n\nThis feeling lasts, and was experienced in the most mesmerising sunrise I\
  \ have experienced thus far. Waking up at 5am, I stepped out of the cold dark shed\
  \ and straight into a sky that looked like it had been set on fire and immediately\
  \ frozen, with the silhouette of the mounds and trees in the distance. The smoke-signal-swirl\
  \ of clouds contained within them a spectrum of yellows, oranges, and reds that\
  \ melted into ash grey. It felt like transitioning between worlds in a cold bubble,\
  \ and then put on pause, unable to feel the heat or hear the crackling of this forest-fire-in-the-sky,\
  \ and paradoxically watching the swirls change shape like in a time-lapse. I was\
  \ called out of this trance by my friend who reminded me that we had a climb ahead\
  \ of us before being able to catch the sunrise \u201Cproper\u201D. We made our way\
  \ up quickly, to watch another drama amidst the clouds unfold. This vantage point\
  \ gave the feeling that the clouds were being called back after a night out in our\
  \ world, the cloud-carpet embedded with hurricanes and dolphin-like splashes as\
  \ it made its way and disappeared into the emerging sunrise. \n\nHaving started\
  \ the morning thus, we trekked back in a wholesome silence peppered with deep nuggets\
  \ of memory-exchanges amidst a completely different aesthetic as it ahd started\
  \ drizzling. Making it out just before the descent of a downpour, we made our way\
  \ back to Viswema village, where our vehicle was parked, and rode back to Kohima,\
  \ fuller, lighter, and closer."
