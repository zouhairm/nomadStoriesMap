Text: "The beach of a Carribean town Playa del Carmen feels like shortbread biscuits:\
  \ with an imperceptible touch, it falls into sandy crumbs. My day starts early.\
  \ Oh, I'm not a morning person at all. It's just my greedy soul that can't miss\
  \ the omelette they offer here before 9 am. Then I voluntary surrender to the Carribean\
  \ sun: please shoot your tiny gold bullets deep into my skin. \n\nMy swimming suit\
  \ cedes to shorts and a thin straps top. Se\xF1oras y se\xF1ores! Another cloudless\
  \ day on this shore! The air temperature is +40 \xB0C. It's only +20 on a bus to\
  \ Cancun, though. \n\nA note to myself: never lose two things\u2014hope and a sweater.\
  \ Especially a sweater when you're planning to take a bus trip in Mexico. Next morning,\
  \ when I'm heading back to Playa del Carmen to have my omelette, grab my bag and\
  \ rush to the airport to take a plane to Mexico City, my body temperature becomes\
  \ even with the air temperature. \n\n\"Hello! Elena speaking. I'm waiting for boarding.\
  \ I'll be there in three hours. You're coming to pick me up, right?\" My broken\
  \ Spanish battles its way through airport noise and a dreadful performance of a\
  \ public phone. \n\"Ehm... We've changed our plans. We're leaving the city for a\
  \ few days, right now. I'm sorry.\"\n\"But what about me?!\"\n\"I'm sorry. Adios!\"\
  \nI didn't know that tears can be that ardent. \n\nSe\xF1ores y se\xF1oras! We'll\
  \ be cruising at an altitude of your desperation. \n\nTears are falling on my thin\
  \ straps top while I'm waiting for my luggage. Thoughts are whirling around my heavy\
  \ head like a baggage carousel. I receive a text message from a friend from Veracruz:\
  \ he found someone to pick me up and take me to a house where I can stay until my\
  \ flight to Moscow. A noble-looking lady from my flight hands me over a piece of\
  \ paper. \"Here's my phone and my address. If nobody's here to pick you up, call\
  \ me and come over.\" Somebody has picked me up. \n\n\"Should we take a taxi?\"\
  \ I'm feeling terrible.\n\"It will take us 100 years to get there. The roads are\
  \ jammed. We better use the subway. Let's go.\" \n\nIf feels like hell. Grey walls,\
  \ law ceilings, stuffy air, bootleg recordings roaring from the speakers of fast\
  \ and furious merchants. I almost faint but nobody gives me a seat. We have to change\
  \ trains. My guide tells me hasn't had lunch yet and wants to get some pizza around.\
  \ He gets a big one\u2014dinner solved! He sits there and eats it slowly. I almost\
  \ lose touch with reality. \n\"Would you like a piece?\" He asks me sincerely. \n\
  I would prefer to die. \n\nThe big two-storey house is calm and chilled. Heavy dark\
  \ blinds cover the windows in my room. It turns out that the guy is a medical student,\
  \ and now he wants to be my doctor. I remember that pizza. He sends me to take an\
  \ ice-cold shower for 10 minures. It hurts badly. For three endless days, I can't\
  \ leave the bed. When the fever goes down, all I want is mashed potatoes. But there\
  \ are only avocado and mango in my hosts' garden.  \n\nThe Blue House with its green\
  \ shutters looks like an extension of the sky over Coyoac\xE1n, blended with tree\
  \ crowns. This is your fortress and your weakness. The buses are still passing around,\
  \ like the one that turned your body into an infinite ulcer but made your spirit\
  \ invincible. Sun-drenched rooms sprinkle citric juices onto the eyes. Here's your\
  \ bed with a mirror over your head, here are your corsets and your wheelchair. Here\
  \ are your paintings. Here are your pain and your love. \u201CFeet, why would I\
  \ want them if I have wings to fly?\u201D I came to you flying. Hello, Frida."
