Text: "I was hit with a sense of emptiness as the train to Bagan pulled out of Mandalay\
  \ station. A curious feeling given that my weeks in Mandalay had been filled nothing\
  \ but warmth and kindness from the locals. I\u2019d met a monk on the U Bein bridge\
  \ at sunset, discussed my relationship status and religious beliefs with almost\
  \ everyone I\u2019d met and was in constant awe of the beautiful pagodas I visited.\
  \ But it was only when I left a place that I started to feel like a foreigner, as\
  \ if I was just an observer passing through. The slow but steady fourteen hour journey\
  \ began, the sound of the train\u2019s wheels blending in with the buzz of the city\
  \ I\u2019d been charmed by.\n\nThe sun was already starting to set, with only a\
  \ strip of orange blazing across the horizon. I was glad for nightfall. The humid\
  \ summer air had pressed down on me, the wide open windows of the train doing little\
  \ to help air circulation. Now there was even a slight night breeze as I rested\
  \ my elbows against the edge of the window. The train rolled passed the glittering\
  \ pagodas with mosaics that dazzled even in the dark. Pass the now empty marketplace\
  \ that had been filled with shops of beautiful fabric waiting to be sewn into longyi.\
  \ Pass the food stalls where I\u2019d eaten bowl after bowl of shan noodles. Pass\
  \ the twenty-four hour tea shops that were starting to bustle with laughter and\
  \ chatter. I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that I hadn\u2019t gotten to know the\
  \ real Mandalay.\n\nThe train moved out of the city centre and into the residential\
  \ areas, moving pass clusters of homes, tightly stacked against each other in an\
  \ unruly puzzle. After the street vendors had packed up their goods and the shopkeepers\
  \ had closed their stores. After everyone returned home after a long day of work\
  \ or school, almost every house was lit. Against the backdrop of the night sky,\
  \ another side of Mandalay revealed itself to me, an observer sitting on a moving\
  \ train. The train moved slow enough for for curious foreigners like me to peek\
  \ into windows and it seemed like people didn\u2019t have a habit of drawing curtains\
  \ or closing doors.\n\nFamilies gathered around a table. Empty plates still on the\
  \ table, remnants of a dinner.\nKitchens stocked with pots and pans, food still\
  \ cooking on the stove. \nA monk sat in the centre of a large room, empty of all\
  \ furniture except for a round carpet. He was pouring over stacks of books that\
  \ surrounded him. \nChildren squeezed around a television, their faces lit up by\
  \ the soft blue light. \nA man bent over a wooden Buddha statue, carving in details\
  \ with great concentration.\nTwo women sat on the porch, one leaned against the\
  \ wall and the other perched on the stairs. One woman used dramatic hand gestures\
  \ as she animately told a story.\n\nThe train was just fast enough that each scene\
  \ flashed for a brief moment before moving on to the next. \n\nStreetlights illuminated\
  \ the details of the bamboo and wooden houses. Some looked mismatched with slanted\
  \ walls and rickety staircases. Some were meticulously built with lovely porches\
  \ and splashes of colour. A turquoise door and a bright yellow staircase. A white\
  \ fence and a purple windowsill. \nMen lounging in the yard, beer in hand.\nThe\
  \ silhouette of a cat sitting on a window ledge, tail swaying. \nThree little boys\
  \ in a yard, crowded around each other in a huddle, devising what seemed to be mischievous\
  \ plan. \nA sparkling red pinwheel was stuck to the side of a house, softly spinning,\
  \ it\u2019s tassels flying in the summer breeze.\n\nAs the train rolled on, I glimpsed\
  \ into scenes of an intimate Mandalay. Me, a curious foreigner looking out the window.\
  \ I think a part of me would always be an observer. But maybe that was okay."
