Text: "As the Land Rover bumped down the dusty trail, I raised my face to the African\
  \ sky and marvelled at the fact that I was really doing this. After a 14 hour flight\
  \ from Washington, DC, an overnight stay in Johannesburg  and a half-day journey\
  \ by plane and van, I was finally fulfilling a lifetime dream,  my first game drive\
  \ in Africa.\nOver the next five days at Mashatu Game Reserve in Botswana, this\
  \ leap into the unknown exceeded my wildest expectations. The experiences ranged\
  \ from the sight of a leopard and her two cubs, high in a tree, feeding on a kudu\
  \  calf while a hyena waited patiently below in the hope that the cats would drop\
  \ some of their kill, to a bull elephant debating whether to charge a Land Rover\
  \ that was blocking his path out of the dry riverbed.\nOur guides were expert at\
  \ determining when and where we would have the best opportunity to view the many\
  \ wild inhabitants of the reserve.\nOne evening , during a night drive, we chanced\
  \ upon  a hyena in the process of stealing a small antelope from two young leopards.\
  \ They were attempting to drag their kill up into a tree but the hyena grabbed it\
  \ from them before they could complete the task. The hyena let out an unearthly\
  \ howl which immediately attracted several more hyenas to the scene. We watched,\
  \ entranced, from our vehicle, as the hyenas chased each other madly around it,\
  \ each trying to get a share of the kill. Finally they managed to tear it in pieces\
  \ and they all ran howling into the darkness of the African night. \nIn contrast\
  \ to this vision of the savage hyena was our view of a mother hyena, carefully watching\
  \ over her young as they played around the entrance to the den, even running around\
  \ our vehicle, oblivious to the fact that we were watching.\nWe were also privileged\
  \ to see a pride of three lionesses and their numerous cubs as well as a female\
  \ cheetah and her cub.\nOne afternoon while resting in my room, I looked out the\
  \ window directly at a large kudu feeding on the bushes only feet from the building.\
  \ \nAlthough I have travelled to many interesting places since, none can quite rival\
  \ the excitement of this long-awaited and thoroughly entertaining sojourn in Botswana."
