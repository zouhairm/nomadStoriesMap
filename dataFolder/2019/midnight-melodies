Text: "Distant thunder grumbled as the humidity withdrew. Darkness strewn like a blanket,\
  \ a thick fleece across the skies. White strikes tore fear into the fabric of night.\
  \ I thought I\u2019d witness palm leaves swaying madly in the wind, but it was merely\
  \ mild, almost motionless. A faded spectrum of fluorescent colour flashed from loosely\
  \ strung fairy lights.\n\nA little thatched shack sat mere centimeters up from the\
  \ road. It looked anything but lively, yet I hotfooted on approach, searching for\
  \ any sign of life. I stepped onto the decking, dozens of flags from every nation\
  \ hung overhead. A figure appeared from the vacant diner, \u2018Hey whazzup?\u2019\
  \ Moments later we are perched by the bar, cold Bintang frothing from the bottle.\
  \ He rolls a new cigar, before producing his guitar and a melody strikes up. The\
  \ chords are familiar and the lyrics ring a bell, but just which song or artist,\
  \ I really can\u2019t tell.\n\nOne by one the decades pass, as I gaze longing into\
  \ the night. My hand runs gently over etched signatures carved into the wooden supports.\
  \ The playlist begins to hint at a particular era and I compare and contrast in\
  \ my mind. Similar age, maybe older, love-sick, content or forlorn? The bottles\
  \ come and go, as do my muddle of thoughts and the intoxicating pairing takes a\
  \ hold. Any worries are left behind and all that remains is a nostalgic trip back\
  \ to the nineties.\n\nBy the end of the night it\u2019s a full sing-along, a live\
  \ impromptu session under the star-studded skies. Many thousands of miles from home\
  \ and I\u2019ve made a new-found friend, united by sweet tones of the acoustic guitar.\
  \ So comfortable am I that I keep going back, night after night, a frequented twilight\
  \ retreat amidst the tense humidity.\n\nEach evening a similar activity pursued,\
  \ we shared metaphors, ambitions and dreams, past stories from our lives, of love,\
  \ loss and the weather. Those distant midnight melodies how often do I think of\
  \ thee, where time and distance melted into drifting tides of empathy and new-found\
  \ spirituality.\n\nThose softly spoken tones they linger still, calling me back\
  \ to those slow, symphonic hours. Merely a memory etched, like the declarations\
  \ that were scrawled into the wood. As those people there before me, those times\
  \ have come and gone, but we\u2019ll always share those hazy eves whether we choose\
  \ to remember or not."
