Text: "I was standing in the middle of the market road, in the town centre of Pushkar,\
  \ a holy temple city in the heart of Rajasthan desert in India. Before my eyes,\
  \ just water everywhere. The usual colourful stalls of flowers, nuts, sugar and\
  \ chai were not catching my attention on that rainy day. All I could see was a brown-ish,\
  \ cloudy, tumultuous liquid\u2026 the rain wouldn\u2019t stop, the level of the\
  \ water kept growing. \u201CWe are in the desert, it\u2019s not supposed to rain\u201D\
  \ said Pritika, my old friend and guide during my discovery trip to India. Locals\
  \ had been complaining about the green look of the hills around the lake, the climate\
  \ was changing. \n\nI booked my trip to India just a couple of weeks before departure,\
  \ after waiting for years to visit my friend from uni. It finally seemed like the\
  \ right time \u2013 if you could call monsoon season the right time to go travel\
  \ all around India-. So far I had visited Goa, in the South, the hippie capital\
  \ of the world, Jaipur, \u201Cthe pink city\u201D in Rajasthan and Pushkar. I was\
  \ going to  spend a couple of weeks in the holy temple town to really get a sense\
  \ of that magical and sacred place. Pushkar\u2019s holy lake is surrounded by 400\
  \ temples. We were trying to get to the oldest one, Brahma\u2019s temple. \u201C\
  Well, yeah, so what should we do?\u201D we were all wearing our flip flops. We needed\
  \ to cross the flooded market to be able to get to the Brahma temple. We looked\
  \ at each other in the eyes and nod. Let\u2019s! \n\nI did it. I actually stepped\
  \ in the ambiguous fluid, which kept growing every step I took. Do you know what\
  \ dominates the roads in India, undisputed? Cows. Cows do, they rule, they are the\
  \ queens. Here I was, walking through the muddy, dirty water, where cows have laid\
  \ their gifts for days, and suddenly I felt somewhat liberated. \n\nThe trip to\
  \ India for me had been a total unexpected experience. Of course, people go to India\
  \ and expect to discover themselves, but what I went through was deeper, and simpler\
  \ than that. I learnt to do nothing. I learnt to just spend the day chilling with\
  \ the beautiful hostel dogs, sipping on Bhang Lassi and playing cards. I actually\
  \ felt like I went back to the roots, living each moment without expectations or\
  \ projections. Walking through the poopy water, really made me feel like we might\
  \ not need that much in life. We were all laughing, a group of random friends from\
  \ everywhere, with that slimy  feeling on our calves and legs, trying to reach the\
  \ temple, and not worrying about anything else than our little courageous mission.\
  \ It was such a beautiful feeling, a honest flow experience, mindfulness at its\
  \ finest, without the need of sophisticated long meditation processes. Just being\
  \ a hundred percent present was enough. The food, the smells, the landscapes, everything\
  \ was more intense, tasty, powerful. \n\nWalking across the flooded town and we\
  \ were all so happy. Reaching the end I thought to myself  \u201CLet\u2019s not\
  \ look down at our feet\u201D. But then, who careed. We reached the beautiful Brahma\
  \ temple, left our slippers outside, immersed ourselves in the busy sacred space,\
  \ offered little sugars to Brahma. When we got out the rain had stopped and a few\
  \ sunrays were trespassing the clouds, giving that glow to the grey sky. -Let\u2019\
  s have some chai- someone said, and we sat in the nearest kiosk where a guy from\
  \ the desert was playing some beautiful yet unpronounceable instrument, similar\
  \ to a mandolin with bells. A red dragonfly landed on our table. Pritika looked\
  \ at me smiling and said \u201CSab Kuch Milega\u201D \u2013 you will get everything,\
  \ and we cheered with the chai."
