Text: "A few things in life can match the pleasure of a completely spontaneous plan\
  \ that goes better than a planned vacation could, especially when you don\u2019\
  t have a true idea of WHERE you\u2019re going. \n\nIt all started with a call made\
  \ to a friend on a Thursday  night who  was very likely free and bored... that friend?\
  \ me. \n\nOne of my best friends, Rosa, wanted to visit a friend of hers in the\
  \ city of Quer\xE9taro in the state of the same name and wasn\u2019t keen on going\
  \ on a road trip alone, so she called me to invite me along, half expecting me to\
  \ say no to such a short notice, and was pleased when after a few seconds pause\
  \ I said \u201C what the hell... let\u2019s do this\u201D\n\nThe itinerary was quite\
  \ simple: first we leave the city early in the morning, we pick up her friend in\
  \ the city of Quer\xE9taro, then we have breakfast reservations on a restaurant\
  \ on the way to our main destination, the town of Dolores Hidalgo, and then spend\
  \ the rest of the weekend exploring the town and some of the neighboring sites.\
  \ \n\nAfter picking her friend up and a few minutes drive, we arrived at a small\
  \ hacienda where my friend Rosa had made reservations for us to have breakfast and\
  \ I remember thinking about how impossibly perfect the scenery was: vineyards under\
  \ a bright warm sun, blue skies, cool breeze, cypress trees, and a lakeside restaurant\
  \ with clear blue water and good artisan food. While my companions ordered and drank\
  \ coffee, I couldn\u2019t resist the urge to take out my camera and explore the\
  \ place for a bit, take pictures and Steal some warm sweet grapes from the vines.\
  \ \n\nAfter a very long breakfast, we payed our bill which I was surprised to find\
  \ to be quite cheap, making a point to bookmark this place for future travels to\
  \ the area, we jumped on the road to the historic town of Dolores, where we had\
  \ an Airbnb reservation and a town full of history and sights to explore.\n\nThe\
  \ thing I remember most about this place  is the way the light hit the streets,\
  \ it felt like the world was made of silver, Banda music playing on the distance\
  \ and the mouthwatering smells of the food from the marketplace wafted through the\
  \ bustle of the townspeople going about their business. \n\nWe walked for hours\
  \ exploring the town, stoping at museums, old churches, and old and bright colored\
  \ buildings to learn the history of the place, and stopping to taste the icecream\
  \ from the vendors in the street corners. Now, this icecream is not for the faint\
  \ hearted, but for the adventurous of stomach, because aside from chocolate and\
  \ vainilla, the icecream in Dolores is famous for going from  \u201Chamburger\u201D\
  \ and \u201Ctaco\u201D icecream to the \u201Clobster\u201D and \u201Cshrimp cocktail\u201D\
  \ flavors which actually do taste like that, which can be confusing when you\u2019\
  re not prepared for the salty taste. \n\nThere\u2019s so much that I remember from\
  \ this trip, so much I could write about, and there\u2019s about a thousand pictures\
  \ in my laptop that I like to see when life gets to gray, but the best thing about\
  \ it was spending time with a close friend while exploring places that were radiant\
  \ with sunlight and color, having so much fun braving the dark highway back, singing\
  \ loudly and terribly to stay awake on the drive back and tasting strange flavors\
  \ for ice cream from amused vendors.\n\nThe best plans are not only those made in\
  \ the blue of spontaneity, the best plans happen when you\u2019re lucky to make\
  \ them with the best people possible."
