Text: "When I rang in 2018, I made it a mission to get to Morocco. I wasn't sure when\
  \ I would go but I had to go before the year ended. This was a country I wanted\
  \ to visit for two years and seeing so many photos, it just made my urge intensify.\
  \ I was in Lisbon at the time and casually, I decided to browse flights to Morocco.\
  \ I saw a 20 euro flight from Madrid on the weekend of my birthday. That was all\
  \ the convincing it took - destiny called and I answered. \n\nIt was time to board\
  \ to Marrakesh and felt my heart thumping when I put my hand over my chest. After\
  \ traveling over-night from one capital to another, I hadn't been this excited to\
  \ go anywhere in a while. I had absolutely no idea what to expect - I never visited\
  \ any country similar to Morocco. I was also a bit nervous because I made no plans\
  \ during my two-week stay. I just knew I was landing, heading to the desert the\
  \ day after, and then, it was all free will. \n\nTwo weeks flew by and my adventure\
  \ through Morocco was coming to an end. I was able to experience different environments,\
  \ like the overwhelming cities, the lazy beachside towns, and villages in the Middle\
  \ Atlas. I ended my voyage in Tangier to meet a friend and catch the ferry to Spain\
  \ together. The entire ride was me expressing my love that grew immensely for this\
  \ North African country. My friend wasn\u2019t surprised at all. He visits Morocco\
  \ multiple times and understood the passion behind every word I was saying.\n\n\
  I didn\u2019t expect to feel such a deep connection with a country I have no roots\
  \ to. But I think that\u2019s what happens when the locals make you feel so welcomed\
  \ and happily open their culture to you. Morocco offered me way more than I expected,\
  \ that at times, I couldn\u2019t even control my emotions. I remember during one\
  \ of my bus rides from Marrakesh to Essaouira, I started crying because I was on\
  \ cloud nine. I just couldn\u2019t believe I was experiencing what I was.\n\nMany\
  \ of the people that I talked to prior to the trip often mentioned how physically\
  \ beautiful the country was but never really talked about the people. Their warmth\
  \ and hospitality are unmatched from other places I have been to. What really surprised\
  \ me was the birthday cake brought for me in the middle of the Sahara Desert. As\
  \ beautiful as any place can be, the locals are truly what makes any place even\
  \ more special.\n\nI went to Morocco with what felt like closed eyes and I left\
  \ with a full heart."
