Text: "In our cushy western lives, peril is not something we face on a daily basis.\
  \ I mean of course, you might burn the roof of your mouth on your morning coffee,\
  \ you could even make the mistake of stepping in front of a bus whilst taking that\
  \ call you shouldn't have. But let\u2019s face it, life can get rather predictable\
  \ unless we choose otherwise or something steps in and bursts our comfortable bubble\
  \ and it'll need to be more formidable than one of those shaggy red foxes we see\
  \ feeding out of a dustbin.\n\nFor myself, being outside is where I feel the most.\
  \ I was fortunate enough to spend 2 years living in Canada's beautiful British Columbia\
  \ and I certainly had my fill of adventures, not least of which was the opportunity\
  \ to road trip through the Canadian Rockies with two of my closest friends, Robert\
  \ and Josh. \n\nA highlight of the trip was our visit to Lake Louise. Not for its\
  \ serenity and grandeur or the drinks menu at the Fairmont Chateau but because we\
  \ were faced with an opportunity to feel really, truly alive. \n\nTo give some context\
  \ we'd been on the road for a few days and our patience for one another was growing\
  \ rather thin, especially between Josh and me. He'd taken to commenting on how ridiculous\
  \ my (newly purchased, now proudly owned) Patagonia hat made my head look and I\
  \ sharply told him he definitely couldn\u2019t pull off his hippy V-neck sweater\
  \ no matter how many cultured coffees he drank in Vancouver. We moved from squabbling\
  \ to disagreements about broader subjects, he is fascinated by wildlife and took\
  \ it a step too far by trying to chase down and catch a chipmunk. I thought it cruel\
  \ and promptly shooed it on its way before Josh could ensnare it. Robert looked\
  \ on, stoically manning the middle ground. \n\nBig picture, we're at Lake Louise,\
  \ one of the most stunning places on the planet and in true Scottish fashion we're\
  \ poking holes in the fact that the lake is still frozen over in May and complaining\
  \ there's too many tourists, many of which couldn't look more out of place.\n\n\
  We opt to find an experience of our own and go for a short hike around the lake.\
  \ About half way along, to our right, we see a gargantuan frozen waterfall at the\
  \ top of a steep incline, complete with shale rock and shrubbery, the route up is\
  \ in a clearing with forests bordering either side. \nWe begin to make the ascent,\
  \ at this point the tension between Josh and I is palpable. Mid-way to the top I\
  \ hear rustling in the forest to our right and spot the outline of a bear, assuming\
  \ it's a black bear and the threat is relatively low I shout to Josh and Robert\
  \ \u201C,look a bear!\u201D \n\nMuch to my dismay the bear (distinctively round\
  \ faced with a silvery hump protruding from its golden brown fur) then hurdled a\
  \ fallen tree, emerged from the forest and started moving at speed, in our direction.\
  \ My eyes widen and breathing goes short as I manage to utter the words \u201C,\
  \ it\u2019s a Grizzly!\u201D The mood changes, our bickering suddenly appears completely\
  \ insignificant. \n\nAbove me, Josh stands perfectly still and stares on in an almost\
  \ trance-like state. Robert and I go into a mad downhill scramble with the hopes\
  \ of making it to the main path, upon which a crowd has now formed calling \u201C\
  BEAR!\u201D In unison. \n\nThe bear is covering ground, fast. At this point Robert\
  \ and I realise running is futile, there\u2019s no chance we\u2019ll cross the bear\u2019\
  s path before it\u2019s upon us. We hopelessly begin to clamber back up the hill,\
  \ pieces of shale fly through the air, eventually we give up and turn to look on\
  \ as the bear barrels past us, not but eight feet in front of our faces. Josh looks\
  \ on utterly mesmerised. In that moment each one of us was totally vulnerable as\
  \ raw, unshakeable wilderness brushed past us. \n\nFast forward to a mundane Monday\
  \ morning commute and the desire to jack-in the office job has reached stifling\
  \ point. I think today\u2019s the day I\u2019ll give notice\u2026"
