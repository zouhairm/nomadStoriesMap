Text: "My story tells a love between an Italian girl and a charming Portuguese. A\
  \ Sa Carneiro's poem was the cupid that made them meet and fall in love. A love\
  \ that turns into an obsession, a betrayed love, a broken heart. The Italian comes\
  \ back home (in Rome) but after years, he is still in her heart and she tells us\
  \ all the story through a flashback looking into the past which is still affected\
  \ her.\nThe protagonist is a young Italian girl who left her small town when she\
  \ was 18, she travelled a lot, going to different colleges in different european\
  \ cities: from Naples to Coimbra, London to  Lisbon, where she finds the peace.\
  \ Moving from one place to another without giving account to anyone and without\
  \ creating bonds with anyone, was her dream until she finds him \"the Tuga of her\
  \ life\".\nDuring the story we see big changes, unexpected turning points: she leaves\
  \ her historic boyfriend after 9 years, falls in love with Portugal and with this\
  \ Portuguese guy, while she is studying a lot for becoming someone. Actually, at\
  \ the end we see her making success and coming back in Portugal as a manager of\
  \ an important Company. She meets him again, she cannot forget, she cannot forgive.\
  \  We explore the life of an Erasmus student, interacting with the place and the\
  \ people, telling the feelings and the love she is living. \n This story expresses\
  \ the new European generation who feels to be for real a European citizen.\nThe\
  \ saudade affects both, but they will find the right courage to move forward, just\
  \ like the great courage the Portuguese had in his imperial paste. She will end\
  \ in Rome, he in England.\nNevertheless, Portugal will be forever the place of their\
  \ love. In Praia do Guicho they said goodbye to each other but in Cabo da Roca they\
  \ promised forever love because only there all the promises of love will make sense\
  \ and, the love of the two will promise such a greatness as the open sea in front\
  \ of  Cabo da Roca, the end of the antic world."
