Text: "What I can say about all the stories regarding my travels and my life overall\
  \ is that I don't regret anything. I have to admit,  I'm not a person that believes\
  \ in many possible realities. I believe many things were meant to be. Everything\
  \ what happened could only turn the way it did. Every small, superficial or even\
  \ unwanted travel, destination or idea might lead you later to something more significant\
  \ in life. Probably you watched Steve Jobs video about connecting the dots much\
  \ more times than you reached for milk in the morning. The dots are experiences.\
  \ You can only connect the dots looking backwards, there is no way to connect them\
  \ looking forward. How can we know if it's the right way, if the choice we are making\
  \ right now will be the best for us? We never know. The only way is to collect as\
  \ many dots and hope for the best. \nThis speech always remembers me about my time\
  \ spent in Basque country, a place I learned existed not that long ago. Long story\
  \ short, few years ago I went to Japan but instead of merging into japanese culture\
  \ I spent most of my time with Spanish speakers. I fell in love with the people,\
  \ the language and the openess of their hearts. From that moment I knew I wanted,\
  \ no, I needed to learn Spanish.  The problem was I was never really interested\
  \ in the conventional Spanish culture. Bull fights, paella, flamenco? Totally not\
  \ my thing. The solution was to go to a region that wouldn't be that conventional:\
  \ Basque country. One friend I met in Japan was so passionate about the region I\
  \ couldn't help but become passionate and interested myself. \nNow after spending\
  \ one year, and another one I look through the window of a plane landing in Bilbao\
  \ and I feel what I felt for the first time. As if I was here before, as if I belonged\
  \ here. I was welcomed by amazingly profound power of nature, green that you won't\
  \ be able to find anywhere else. Going outside of the plane I zip my coat very tightly\
  \ and even though I felt as if the cold was dissolving my bones, my entusiasm kept\
  \ me alive. \nBasque country never dissapoints me. Okay, maybe the weather. I think\
  \ the neighter weather heard about the region thats why sometimes she forgets to\
  \ make a visit ;). Everytime during my time there I experience moments, that stay\
  \ in my memory for a really long time. Stories, that my good friends are sick of\
  \ hearing. I meet people so warm and kind as nowhere else in the world but maybe\
  \ its only my perception. \nWhen I first arrived I didn't know where I was going\
  \ to stay, if the people I was about to meet will be nice, I got really conscious\
  \ before entering the plane. When I arrived, it somehow felt familiar even though\
  \ I've never been there before. For the first time in my life I felt like home,\
  \ at a real home. So if that is the danger of travelling alone- I never want to\
  \ stop."
