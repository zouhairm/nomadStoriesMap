Text: "Last summer was one of the best summer times I have ever spent. \nTraveling\
  \ with the whole familly is one of the best things I like to experience and live,\
  \ also it's one of the best ways I like to spent my holydays . \nThe destination\
  \ was determined, Morocco is rich with landscapes, we chose the north.\nAnd when\
  \ I say rich with landscapes, I really mean it. \nAnd one of the cities that must\
  \ be visited in my beautiful country is Chefchaouen \xABThe Blue City\xBB.\nBeside\
  \ the nick name that owns this pretty place in this world, we also call the native\
  \ people of this piece of moroccan's landscape \"Highlanders\".\nI have always wonderred\
  \ why we do call them so. \nWell, when I visited the city the last summer, I found\
  \ out why and figured out the reason.\nIt is trully a blue city as they call it,\
  \ and it is located located in the north west of the country especially in the Rif\
  \ Mountains. \n\n\nMy story is about that day when we went , me and most of my familly\
  \ members, to Chefchaouen. \nIt was just one day because we had setteled in another\
  \ town for our summer vacation. \nI was so exited to go there and I really loved\
  \ the city. \nIt felt extremely hot that day,I couldn\u2019t describe it ; the heat\
  \ of summer days in Morocco, you feel the sun just above your head. \nI felt like\
  \ the town is built on a mountain. As long as we climb its street, the sun gets\
  \ closer and closer to your head. \nI would never forget that day because of that\
  \ excessive heat, but I enjoyed myself.\n Anyway next, I was always wondering why\
  \ we call the natives of that city \xAB highlanders \xBB, then I discovered, littaralely,\
  \ why. \nWell, because the city is located in a mountain of Rif\u2019s. It is really\
  \ a pretty town. \nWhen we came to one of the estuaries of the source of water,called\
  \ abviously chafchaouen\u2019s source of water, I jumped up to where there\u2019\
  s some of this water ,and at my surprise, the water was extremely cold so cool,\
  \ my feet froze and they ached me, however the water was so refreshing. In our way\
  \ up to the top of the city, because you are either climbing or comming back down\
  \ its streets, you come across several fortifying water fountains from where you\
  \ can drink by taking small or even handfull of mouthfuls. That allows to regain\
  \ some energy under the heat so you can carry on your journy in that Blue City It\u2019\
  s a funny way to wander the town.\nHaouef, what a work out wandering that city!\
  \ End of the day and  we should head down to where we spend our holidays.\nOh, in\
  \ our way to Chafchaouen we took the coastal road, but hey, it\u2019s breathtaking,\
  \ all that natural scenery, it\u2019s really beautiful out there. The road is a\
  \ bit narrow, but the view is worth visiting and seeing. The medeteranian sea from\
  \ one side and the Rif\u2019s Mountaines from the other side.\nThat was my story,\
  \ I hope you\u2019ll like it."
