Text: "Bright sunlit rooftops stretched to touch the mountains\u2019 feet on one side,\
  \ while simultaneously catching up to the waves that met the horizon on the other.\
  \ The golden rays were dancing with the soft rainy haze and from their subtle romance,\
  \ a magnificent rainbow was born, its beauty only matched by its fainter twin behind.\
  \ It isn\u2019t just this view from the hilltop of Bunkers, Barcelona, that\u2019\
  s very special to my heart. It is also the calmness in thought that was brought\
  \ on by the scene \u2013 a pause in the race that life had become, a pause to remember\
  \ the joyful moments and the smaller victories.\n\nI had moved to this city for\
  \ a semester to work on a college project. A new country. A new language. An ambitious\
  \ project \u2013 one that required several nights and weekends to be spent in the\
  \ lab. From searching for accommodation to writing up reports, deadlines loomed\
  \ everywhere. Amidst all the haste, there were a few stolen moments that made everything\
  \ seem better. And these were the moments that I relived in my mind, from the hilltop\
  \ of Bunkers, Barcelona.\n\nThe reverberating chorus from under the myriad of costumes\
  \ and the synchronised rhythm of the drummers' dance were more than just inviting.\
  \ On that beautiful evening, Las Ramblas, my favourite street for late night walks,\
  \ was lost under the crowds of gathering tourists and locals. All sense of apprehension\
  \ evaporated as I joined in jaunty dance, the parade of Barcelona's 'CARNIVAL'.\
  \ As I recalled that scene of Spanish fervour, from the hilltop of Bunkers, Barcelona,\
  \ the many hues of celebration slowly faded to a dark night sky and the heat of\
  \ the fireworks gave way to a cold sea-breeze in my mind...\n\nYellow lights sprayed\
  \ romance into the air, from behind the glasses of Gaudi's street lamps. I stared\
  \ for a while at the hundred eyes that were the resting boats, before I turned back\
  \ to look at the Greek boy. We had only met once before. Yet somehow, as we sat\
  \ at the harbour that night, as we talked about our cultural differences, the existence\
  \ of God and the reaches of science, a stranger at dusk had become a friend at dawn.\
  \ And along with the memory of the rising sun, from the hilltop of Bunkers, Barcelona,\
  \ my mind moved on to a different scene.\n\nA few of us had set off on a completely\
  \ self-organised trip to Italy. The tickets were booked but there was no time to\
  \ plan the rest. Of course, this meant a desperate sprint at 3 am to catch the flight\
  \ and then being stranded from missing the last bus on the first night in Rome.\
  \ Consequently, this also meant witnessing human creativity peak in moments of panic.\
  \ With insufficient money to bear the expense of taking a cab to our accommodation,\
  \ we talked a McDonald's manager into letting us stay there for an entire night!\
  \ The next morning, kicked out early by the manager, we reached the Vatican City\
  \ where the crowd pulled us into the Sunday mass, and before we knew it, we were\
  \ waving at the Pope. Being cautious of missing the bus again, we left early for\
  \ Pisa that night, only to reach at 3 am, with no sign of accommodation. Heavily\
  \ sleep deprived, we pulled out our blankets, leaned against the locked gates of\
  \ the Leaning Tower and fell asleep right there on the road. Since we were the first\
  \ ones there, the following morning was one of unobstructed photography that any\
  \ tourist would dream of! Finally when we reached Milan that night, we saw beds\
  \ for the first time in 3 days. Some of us even cried from joy. \n\nAs I recollected\
  \ all this, from the hilltop of Bunkers, Barcelona, I breathed a sigh of satisfaction.\
  \ I had made it. In a new country. With a new language. On an ambitious project.\
  \ And with tons of memories and stories to tell."
