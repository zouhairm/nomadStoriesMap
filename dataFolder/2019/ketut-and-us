Text: "Ketut and Us.\nOne week before booking my ticket, the newspapers, news channels\
  \ and a lot of word of mouth were all (coincidently) against me. Mount Agung erupted,\
  \ cabbies were misbehaving with Indian customers, pickpocketing and thefts had increased\
  \ in frequency. My parents told me \u201Cno\u201D with a straight face. I had no\
  \ way around. With a lot of persuasions and inner motivation, I managed to convince\
  \ them and on 6th December 2017, I booked my flight for Denpasar and hotel in Nusa\
  \ Dua. \nUpon arrival, I felt like I had time travelled. A whole new attitude and\
  \ culture awaited me. I was greeted by the localites at the airport waiting to eagerly\
  \ take me to my hotel. Selamat Datang! The ride to my hotel was a little more than\
  \ just exciting. It was new. I had always read and heard and seen about such magical\
  \ destinations but witnessing them personally, I have to say; google images does\
  \ not do justice. The cabbie noticed me gawking with my mouth open. He chuckled\
  \ and said, \u201CYou\u2019re too cute. Are you from India?\u201D I could barely\
  \ manage an \u201Cahuh\u201D from my mouth. Sat with crossed legs and in centre\
  \ of the backseat, my head\u2019s movement resembled that of a sparrow\u2019s. My\
  \ hotel was situated just opposite the beach so I took advantage of the evening,\
  \ my mood and relaxed while sipping Bintang. Little had I expected what was coming\
  \ next. At the beach, a lot of localites hold their businesses. Massages, cold and\
  \ hard drinks, fast food, hair accessories and surfing! It somehow became very hard\
  \ for me to decide what to do first. I mean, I only had one evening to myself. I\
  \ was scheduled to meet my friends the next morning. Ketut, the owner of the cold\
  \ and hard drinks kiosk came up to me to offer what he had available. Deprived of\
  \ proper rest, I happily accepted another Bintang. He also told me how his mama\
  \ does hair accessories. I told him I\u2019d come tomorrow with my friends to do\
  \ the same. \nMeeting my friends halfway across the world (or at least that\u2019\
  s what I like to say), made me instantly energized and jumpy. At lunch, we met with\
  \ some very friendly Indonesians who invited us over for the evening. Guess who!\
  \ Ketut! Their house looked straight out of a fairy tale. A two-storey building\
  \ with a private lawn, swimming pool and a rice field. Their hospitality was commendable.\
  \ His mama baked some delicious desert as we sat by the pool listening to their\
  \ daily lifestyle and hilariously crazy stories! We met his wife, his sister, sister\u2019\
  s husband and kids and mama\u2019s boyfriend. Sitting at a localite\u2019s house\
  \ feeling at ease with no pressure, no responsibilities, eating and drinking, that\u2019\
  s a vacation. We knew we had connected to this family in an unknown way. We had\
  \ feelings, positive ones. After sundown, we lit up a bonfire and continued to get\
  \ to know each other. His mama again cooked some local food for us. Bakmi/nasi Goreng,\
  \ Peps, Soto Betawi, Sayur Asem which of course had to go with Bintang. Meeting\
  \ and learning so much about that family took our vacation a notch higher. After\
  \ Nusa Dua, we went to Kuta, Seminyak and Ubud. Throughout the trip, Ketut had kept\
  \ in touch with us told us tricks and treats that could help us. As one would say,\
  \ \u201Cit was Bagus!\u201D \nShopping and sight seeing had become relatively easier\
  \ because of Ketut\u2019s help. He gave us contacts of his friends who were cabbies.\
  \ They took us everywhere and at any time. He had friends at restaurants too. One\
  \ very famous restaurant called Queens of India. The best one to go to if you ever\
  \ feel homesick. Overall, I don\u2019t think our vacation could have gotten any\
  \ better. Met new friends, captured some of the best memories and shopped till we\
  \ dropped. I often fear that my memory will start to fade and I\u2019ll forget the\
  \ smallest moments that make up for the biggest emotions. But at least now I can\
  \ say that I really did have the time of my life in Bali."
