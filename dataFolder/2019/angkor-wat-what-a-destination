Text: "The Travel enthusiast in me was planning for a solo trip from a long time.\
  \ Luckily I got this opportunity in the month of December 2018. The next big question\
  \ was where I should go . So I planned a quick solo trip to Siem Reap to explore\
  \ Angkor Wat \nI zeroed down on a 3 day trip to Angkor Wat in Siem Reap basis the\
  \ above. I booked a flight to Siem Reap via Bangkok. For Cambodia I applied for\
  \ e-visa online. It\u2019s the fastest and the most smooth visa processing I have\
  \ experience till date. Within2 minutes of applying for visa, I was granted the\
  \ Visa! \nTravel from Mumbai to Bangkok to Siem Reap was absolutely hassle free.\
  \ Ditching the conventional branded hotels, I opted for a small family run boutique\
  \ spa resort in Siem Reap. This was the best decision ever. They were 10/10 on hospitality\
  \ , ambience , friendliness and safety \u2013 something which a solo traveller will\
  \ seek from its hotel.  Post check in, I went to attend the traditional and most\
  \ talked out \u2013 Apsara dance show at Siem Reap.\nThe next morning was the D\
  \ Day for which the entire trip was planned, a trip to Angkor Wat, the largest temple\
  \ complex in the world. It was recommended to me to start the day early i.e. to\
  \ reach the temple premises latest by 7 am to see the temple in morning glory and\
  \ to avoid the heavy tourist rush as December is one of the peak tourist season\
  \ the Temples. My hotel readily arranged a Tuk-tuk for me for the entire duration\
  \ of the trip . We collected one \u2013 day temple pass on our way to temple and\
  \ I was at the entrance of the temple by 7.15 am.\nI easily got a registered guide\
  \ at the entrance of the temple complex who promised me to take through all the\
  \ main sights of the temple in 3 hours. Investing in a guide was the best decision\
  \ I made that day !. He knew his subject too well and a seasoned photographer also\
  \ which came in quite handy for me.\nTo begin with, Angkor Wat is the largest temple\
  \ complex in the world from 12th Century spread across 400 acres and dedicated to\
  \ Hindu God Vishnu. According to legend, the construction of Angkor Wat was ordered\
  \ by Indra to serve as a palace for his son .\nThe place has no doubt quite a divine\
  \ charm to itself. The carvings throughout the ruins are beautiful. It\u2019s amazing\
  \ how this was all man-made in the ancient world with limited means. Tourist and\
  \ the history enthusiast flock the famous \u201CLotus Pond\u201D at the entrance\
  \ of the temple to witness magnificent sunrise above the 5 peaks of the temples\
  \ (which is supposed to represent the Mount Meru). Similarly at the Bayon temple\
  \ ( which is to the North of the main temple complex) there are 216 faces of smiling\
  \ ( meditating Buddha) and the crowd of crazy eager tourist wanting to get \u201C\
  Nose to Nose \u201C with Buddha. A walk across the main sites of the temple and\
  \ you are awestruck at the beautiful and outstanding Khmer architecture. Finally\
  \ at the end of the 4 hours  , my legs were tired but my heart wanted more !! .\
  \ I indulged in the foot spa to sooth my tiring feet at the hotel\u2019s spa.  In\
  \ evening I checked out the Pub Street which is the most happening street in entire\
  \ Siem Reap known for local shopping , local spice market , high end boutiques and\
  \ quirky restaurants. Night market was similar to typical South Asian night markets.\n\
  Next morning before checking out for airport , I made a quick trip to National Museum.\
  \ I will say visiting the museum post the visit to temple made much more sense as\
  \ I could related to everything that was put up at museum.\nI enjoyed each and every\
  \ moment of my solo adventure and came back happy, rejuvenated and satisfied. Though\
  \ this was my first experience of solo travel but it left me wanting for more."
