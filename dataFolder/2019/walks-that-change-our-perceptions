Text: "It has been over a year since I did this trip, but I still remember it as if\
  \ it had been yesterday. I went to Poland for 3 days but the last 16 hours had me\
  \ on an emotional roller coaster that started when getting off the bus in Krakow\
  \ I decided to walk, at 8 pm during winter, from the bus station to the hostel I\
  \ had booked. \nWhat some people do not know is that during winter the sky darkens\
  \ early so by that time it was really black. Must add that I come from a South American\
  \ country where you are told all your life that it is unsafe to travel alone, mostly\
  \ for girls, but I was in Europe and had to take advantage of every day there. Dark\
  \ sky and paranoia talking, feel my stress levels?\nSo, although I wanted to be\
  \ calm and show that everything was fine, the darkness did not help my eagerness\
  \ to find the hostel nor the 2 degrees Celsius temperature that had me shivering\
  \ with every step I took. The streets were a bit empty at the moment and they seemed\
  \ so long I thought I would never find the place, even complained that my downloaded\
  \ map was failing, taking me about 20 minutes to find a small sign on the wall that\
  \ meant my hostel was there. Will not lie, it was such a stressful walk that when\
  \ I reached the hostel I just stayed there, no intention of going into the city\
  \ center to know the surroundings. \nThe next morning, I decided to go to the main\
  \ plaza and find the city\u2019s beautiful sights, as soon as I stepped out of the\
  \ hostel the city looked like taken out of a fairy tale. It was cold but not to\
  \ the point that you needed more than a jacket and knitted hat, no need for gloves\
  \ yet and still nice enough for a stroll passing streets that some had recently\
  \ been cleaned and the rest that had remains of snow but just waiting for their\
  \ turn to be cleaned. \nDuring my walk, I realized there were many locals walking\
  \ about getting into taxis or taking the public transportation to go to their jobs\
  \ while very few tourists, by the time I got to the central plaza I found the tourists\
  \ and the only locals nearby were the ones putting up their business stands for\
  \ the Christmas holiday fair. \nWhile I waited for the fair to be set I walked around\
  \ the plaza looking for anything historical to be open but it seemed everything\
  \ was still to be closed, so I decided to take cover from the weather for a bit\
  \ and headed for a small coffee store to have breakfast. Once there, I noticed I\
  \ had stumbled into a very international style business but still it was the only\
  \ thing available so I stayed. As I enjoyed my meal I got to see the number of tourists\
  \ and local people that would come in for their morning beverages, everyone at their\
  \ own speed but still admiring the holiday feel that was all around. \nA few hours\
  \ later, I walked around the fair to enjoy and purchase some of the handmade crafts\
  \ that were exhibited, even stopped for some local cookies that made a perfect snack\
  \ and the scent of fresh pierogi also captured me so I had to try them. Every stand\
  \ had a different personality that went with the owners; some were more joyful than\
  \ others but still all very cheerful and full of colors that went perfectly with\
  \ the holiday mood. \nWhile I was heading back to the hostel to catch my flight\
  \ home, not only did it start snowing which felt fresh and cold mixed with a light\
  \ sunbeam feeling, but I started to hear a \u201Cflop\u201D sound and feel that\
  \ my shoe had gum underneath. After a couple of steps of getting stuck to the ground,\
  \ I decided to stop and see what was happening. I will just say my shoe sole was\
  \ done for the trip and while having no other pair of shoe it was a floppy trip\
  \ back home."
