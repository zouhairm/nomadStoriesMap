Text: "During the war in Afghanistan, my father left Kabul and went to Waziristan,\
  \ the home town of my father. In 1995 when I born my father already spent 5 years\
  \ in Waziristan, and he had no plan to leave it. When I was 5 years old, my father\
  \ decided to send my big brother who is 2 years older than me to boarding school\
  \ in Pakistan. My brother was agreeing to go only in one condition if I join the\
  \ journey to his School. Leaving my region for the first time, I was so excited,\
  \ and my eyes were open to exploring everything. On the way when we already crossed\
  \ the border of Pakistan, stopped the car for lunch break. When I came out of the\
  \ care, holding my father hand, I saw a man baking bread in Tandoor, I was so surprised\
  \ and told my father \u201CLook at there, man is baking bread\u201D. I was surprised\
  \ because I have never seen men before doing housework. My father replied, \u201C\
  Yes, men also do such jobs, but not in our town, that\u2019s why I am sending your\
  \ brother for education, so he could find better\u201D. When we reached our destination,\
  \ I told my father that I want to stay here with my brother and want to find better.\
  \ My father was happy and proud. He took admission for both of us in boarding school.\
  \ After spending 6 years in boarding school, coming back, my viewpoint was different.\
  \ Later I studied in Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Azerbaijan. But whenever I look at\
  \ that point when I saw men baking bread for the first time, I get scared, what\
  \ if I would not be stayed with my brother in boarding school? What would be my\
  \ life?"
