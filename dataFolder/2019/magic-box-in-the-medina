Text: "The warm hospitality rivaled only by the Sahara sun embraces me in the Moroccan\
  \ city of Marrakesh. Its small vendor filled old Medina streets overflowing with\
  \ Moroccans selling; food, crafts, leather bags, metal lamps and century old rugs.\
  \ The now familiar smell of spices cooking in tajins, a traditional Moroccan dish,\
  \ filling the air as I walk from my friends Spice and herb bazaar to the foundouk\
  \ where the first group of people I met a month ago on my first day in Marrakech\
  \ go about their day eeking out a living. \n\nIt was within these crowded alley\
  \ ways I was exploring deep in the medina that I met Hassan. Squatting outside a\
  \ small magic box shop holding the tools of a carpenter whittling out chess pieces\
  \ he caught my attention holding on and drawing me in as soon as eye contact was\
  \ made. Falling into his gaze I stopped to listen. Immediately explaining his work\
  \ while gently placing a small ceder piece of wood in his tool held by his toes,\
  \ he began crafting the piece into a necklace which he would gift me solidifying\
  \ a friendship that would change my journey becoming one with the locals exploring\
  \ places only they know instead of journeying around with other travelers exploring\
  \ places described in guidebooks.  \n\nMohammed quickly made his way over both men\
  \ attempting to sell me magic boxes setting their price eight times higher knowing\
  \ I'd barter my way down. Four hundred Durham they explained informing me of the\
  \ length it takes to make such a box. \n\n\"Eighty!\" I countered \n\n\"Two hundred\
  \ fifty!\" they replied. \n\n\"Eighty, no more!\" I responded. \n\n\"You're joking,\
  \ give us a real price not a jokers price\". Mohammed replied. \n\n\"Eighty or I'm\
  \ walking away.\" \n\n\"Ah, eighty is a joke, tell us a real price and here take\
  \ it.\" They responded. \n\nAnd with that I turned and began walking away. \n\n\"\
  Ok, eighty, come on take it, it's Ramadan and business is slow. You are a good bargainer,\
  \ you must be part Berber.\" Replied Mohammed. \n\nI quickly passed them a one hundred\
  \ note telling them to keep the change for their bargaining skills. \n\nDeep into\
  \ conversation they invited me to join them later at their fondouk for the breaking\
  \ of the fast. Not quite sure if this was a trick to get me somewhere to rob me\
  \ I decided to go with my instincts and accept their offer joining them at 7:40pm\
  \ for breakfast. \n\nMy dinner which to them is breakfast after not eating, drinking\
  \ or smoking the entire day beginning at 3:40am and ending at 7:40pm began with\
  \ a single date followed by Harrera, a traditional Morrocan soup, home made yogurt\
  \ and the grand prize a home made chicken tajin with its fresh herbs and spices.\
  \ \n\nThe following days found me at the fondouk sewing leather, carving wood and\
  \ howling the night away playing cards while eating until our bellies filled, the\
  \ mosque prayer calls breaking the silence until one by one everyone returned to\
  \ their homes the sun rising above the old buildings casting shadows along the alleys\
  \ ways. \n\nAnd so passed the days hanging out with my new friends, learning Bits\
  \ of Arabic, making crafts and learning the skills of the kitchen until three weeks\
  \ later I decided to leave the Medina and explore the rest of this incredible country."
