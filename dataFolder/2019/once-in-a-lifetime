Text: "I have no doubts that at least once in a lifetime each of us has to believe\
  \ in something wonderful there. Because there something wonderful always believes\
  \ in us.\n\nCraving for new adventures, my rambling heart yields to another fit\
  \ of mono-mountaineering that forces me deep into the wild and up there where marvellous\
  \ and mighty peaks can transform your mind forever. The fickle weather promises\
  \ a rainstorm, so I set off light hoping to cover the distance within two days.\n\
  \nA muddy path weaves under my feet, detailing the history of the local life. Rare\
  \ elk tracks hurrying here, circular horse hoofs trotting there, someone\u2019s\
  \ large paws crossing them all and accurately followed by little ones. And no human\
  \ trace whatsoever.\nIn this land nature melts all possible colours in her own unmistakable\
  \ manner: mountain heather rocks, arctic willow shrubs, rhododendron slopes. Thick\
  \ dwarf pine patches mixed with swamps make you detour on a regular basis. Apparently\
  \ not without good reason, Kutkh the Raven is often mocked in indigenous legends,\
  \ \u201CWas the Creator smart enough, he would have never built such impenetrable\
  \ woods.\u201D But serene summer buzzing, splashing, and gushing uplift my spirits;\
  \ slowly but surely I approach the designation point\u2026 \n\nAt the Okura River,\
  \ an unexpected wave of drowsiness comes upon me. The clove cinnamon smell of tundra\
  \ makes it irresistible and I willingly give in. The time flows unnoticed. My eyes\
  \ open. Something huge, uncertain, obscure stands just in front of me, towering\
  \ over. Two smaller shadows swirl in the air and stop still two feet away. I raise\
  \ my hand to shield from the sun, trying to recognise the creatures.\n\n(It was\
  \ an hour before that I searched my pockets without much success: a hungry swamp\
  \ had swallowed my shoe, torch, and animal deterrent spray. \nA face-to-face encounter\
  \ is not a good idea now.)\n\nNow, standing there four feet to a mother bear and\
  \ two to her cubs, I cannot but stare into her eyes. All the volcanic ash, deep\
  \ grass, rocky heights, soft distances \u2013 the whole expanse of the vast territory\
  \ with all its forces of nature seem to have shrunk into this massive body to observe\
  \ you through these watchful eyes: strikingly conscious and studious.\nInstantly,\
  \ a girlish thought flashes through my mind, \u201CI can\u2019t die like that. Not\
  \ in this T-shirt. It\u2019s too silly.\u201D The mother bear takes a step and pauses;\
  \ our eyes fixed on each other; both strained and alert. The baby bears rise on\
  \ their hind legs. Probably, their first human\u2026 They seem half-starved after\
  \ a hard winter period... The worst possible scenario ever\u2026 \nSuddenly, as\
  \ if reading my mind, she turns her head to her babies, steps aside and hides behind\
  \ a pine bush at the path; the cubs follow obediently. Her fluffy caramel back sticks\
  \ out from there meaning that she does not intend to move farther. \nShe merely\
  \ gives way.\nAstonished but awaiting no special invitation, I slip under my backpack\
  \ and run past and fast. \n\nThe next day a reindeer herder picks me up. The wise\
  \ sixty-two with sharp almond eyes laughs heartedly at me, \u201CThe bear is the\
  \ king here and highly respected. Probably knows English,\u201D points he at my\
  \ hand-made T-shirt that says, KEEP CALM & LOVE BEARS.\n\u201CHowever, if you do\
  \ not have a dog and travel alone \u2013 at least smoke.\u201D \n\u201CSmOke?! Never\
  \ had a cigarette in my hand.\u201D\n\u201CIt is not about smoking, it\u2019s all\
  \ about the smell. The bear detests it.\u201D\n\u201CSo do I!\u201D\n\u201CThen\
  \ just light a cigarette, make smoke and wait\u2026which of you will crack first.\u201D\
  \nA thunder of his laughter creeps through my spine up to my face, leaving me with\
  \ a broad smile and amaze. Well, indeed, it turns upside down the whole idea of\
  \ 'the last cigarette before execution' (when it actually becomes first and life-saving).\
  \ Little did I know that bears could demonstrate such a meticulous approach. Especially\
  \ in the month most difficult for them, the low season between \u2018no mushroom\u2019\
  \ and \u2018no fish\u2019.\n\nNon-humans have finally entered my list of honour,\
  \ the list of those wonders of the world that inspire and make me genuinely wonder,\
  \ \u201CWill we ever live up to this incredible planet?\u201D"
