Text: "Lisbon Symbols: The Fado and the churches\n\nLisbon is a yellow city with a\
  \ Mediterranean climate, situated at Tagus River. Characterized by yellow old tram,\
  \ yellow buildings and yellow egg tarts, Lisbon shows its extreme beauty to the\
  \ world. \n\nA city must have sounds. It can be silence in the night, but during\
  \ the day time it should use all her energy to make sound. What is the sound of\
  \ Lisbon or what kind of sound can represent Lisbon? The answer must be the Fado.\
  \ A famous sentence goes: \u201CIf you have not listened to the Fado, you have not\
  \ touched the soul of Lisbon.\u201D The Fado singers express their happiness, sadness\
  \ and love in this form of art. The mayor of Lisbon once said: \u201CThe Fado now\
  \ belongs to humanity. Yet in its essence it already belongs to the world, as it\
  \ is the repository of various influences, people and cultures.\u201D\n\nThe Fado\
  \ was born within the popular context of the 19th century Lisbon, and is present\
  \ in leisure meetings, in both broad and narrow streets, indoors or outdoors in\
  \ the fields, in bullfights, in restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, and brothels. I\
  \ got an opportunity to enjoy the Fado at a famous restaurant in Lisbon. This kind\
  \ of songs could remind you of all your happiness and sadness. It would enable you\
  \ be easily indulge in a deep emotion. A Portuguese word \u201CSaudade\u201D always\
  \ shows up in the Fado. It means a complicated feeling that combines sorrow, longing,\
  \ and regret. Portuguese liked the Fado maybe because it can express their \u201C\
  Saudade\u201D: disappointed about politics, lost hope about future and recalled\
  \ the glorious of the past Marine time. Maybe \u201CSaudade\u201D and the Fado can\
  \ really represent this charm and sorrowful city.\n\nThere is also another sound\
  \ in Lisbon. Sound from the church. It should be silent in church. But only in that\
  \ case, can you hear the sound of praying in people\u2019s heart. There are three\
  \ famous churches in Lisbon: Lisbon Cathedral, Church of S\u0101o Domingos and the\
  \ Mosteiro dos Jer\xF3nimos. As a mix of different architectural styles, Lisbon\
  \ Cathedral was built in the year 1147. In the central top of front gate, there\
  \ is a round window likes a dish of wheel which symbolize the glorious Marine time.\
  \ At Church of S\u0101o Domingos, we can also see trace of fire in 1755 Lisbon earthquake.\
  \ It was totally destroyed inside. Through the efforts made by Royal and its believers,\
  \ it recoveried soon of its outside. When you enter into it, you can listen to the\
  \ pray: \u201CLead us to a place. Guide us with your grace. Give us faith. So we\
  \ will safe.\u201D Mosteiro dos Jer\xF3nimos is the most magnificent monastery in\
  \ Lisbon. It was built by the Infante Henry the Navigator around 1459 and was classified\
  \ in 1983 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. To many people\u2019s surprise, it survived\
  \ the 1755 earthquake with nary a scratch. As Philip Graham said in his book The\
  \ Moon, Come to earth: \u201CIts stone pillars, reaching to the heights of the intricately\
  \ sculpted vault, appear far more delicate with engineering skills in the service\
  \ of the miraculous.\u201D"
