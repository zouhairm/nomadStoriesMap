Text: "Reminder- Discovery \nThe white marble structure was overwhelming. I stood\
  \ opposite to the \u2018Conqueror of The World\u2019. 500 years ago, it would\u2019\
  ve been impossible for a commoner like me to even face a Mughal King. Today, I fixed\
  \ my gaze on his cenotaph and for a moment I could feel a call from the 17th-century\
  \ subcontinent. Melancholy came over me and a prayer slipped from my mouth. \n\u201C\
  Do you know the extraordinary feature of the stones embedded in the tiles?\u201D\
  , asked the keeper of the tomb, interrupting my train of thoughts. \nHe was pointing\
  \ to the pietra dura on the grave. His voice echoed in the small octagonal chamber\
  \ when he heard my \u2018No\u2019 and he took out an old Nokia phone from his pocket.\
  \ Turning the flashlight on, he asked me to look closely at the floral pattern.\n\
  I bent on my knees as he pointed the flashlight towards the stones. Each petal glimmered\
  \ one by one.  Sensing my bewilderment, the keeper shifted the rusty keys to his\
  \ other hand and pointed his finger to the roof and said, \u201CThis roof wasn\u2019\
  t here before. The grave was exposed to the sky and the light from the sun and the\
  \ moon illuminated it as if jewels covered the marble\u201D. I looked over to the\
  \ Persian inscription on the tombstone that said, \u2018This is the illuminated\
  \ grave of His Majesty, The Asylum of Pardon, Nooruddin Muhammad Jahangir Padishah\
  \ 1057 AH\u2019. I finally understood what it all meant. \nAs the keeper narrated\
  \ the stories of loot and theft, I stood baffled, for it struck me that this was\
  \ the closest I\u2019ve ever been to a King, dead or alive. Listening to the atrocities\
  \ of the rulers and the people and the damage they had done to this beauty, I felt\
  \ apologetic. It looked as if the honor was stripped away from the King. The rubies\
  \ and gems were gone and what was left was this grave and the frescoes. Looking\
  \ at that, I imagined the moonlight bouncing off the grave and mourned for a past\
  \ that I never had.  \nJust moments ago, when I was balancing my camera outside\
  \ the locked chamber while my cousin talked to the gatekeeper, I was ready for rejection.\
  \ But destiny brought me right next to the unrecognized heritage. It brought me\
  \ there so that I could recall the magnificent era I\u2019d read about in history\
  \ books and see for myself the fall of the mighty. I felt sorry not just for the\
  \ man in the grave, but for me and my nation. He was the prime, I \u2013 the nadir.\
  \ \nExiting the chamber, I took one last glance at the tomb. Some 600 km away the\
  \ Taj Mahal is bursting with life but here, alone in the darkness, rests Jahangir,\
  \ the \u2018world-seizer\u2019, whose tomb awaits a stamp from UNESCO, whose keeper\
  \ needs convincing to let people in, where even the River Ravi has changed its course\
  \ as if ashamed of its history, and whose grave isn\u2019t able to see the light\
  \ of the day anymore."
