Text: "Mumbai was boiling and outside the famous Chathrapathi Shivaji International\
  \ Airport was chaos; a thousand people and as much cars, their honks and loud conversations.\
  \ It was unbearable. I was more of a green person, so my mood got messed up because\
  \ I could have taken my usual vacation, but I decided to come to this city and ruin\
  \ my vacation. And during that time I was attempting to write a novel, so I feared\
  \ that the city would trouble my writing schedule; even though I was staying in\
  \ Mumbai for only five days.\n\nSo I nodded to myself and tried to stay calm and\
  \ looked at this man who was chewing betel leaves and staring at me. He looked like\
  \ he was a parking assist, so I asked him \u2018Where should I go to get a city\
  \ bus? I want to go to Navi Mumbai\u2019 and this man who kept chewing. It was only\
  \ after a few seconds of continuing the stare and spitting out the betel leaves\
  \ out of his mouth that he answered my question. He said that there wasn\u2019t\
  \ a direct bus and that it would be easier for me to get a taxi.\n\nBut I couldn\u2019\
  t spend that much and was kind of ashamed to tell him that, so I walked, thinking\
  \ why that man was staring in the first place.\nBut before I walked too far, I learned\
  \ that being stared at around this particular area wasn\u2019t unusual, all of them\
  \ are watching visitors and assessing if they could contribute something to the\
  \ small scale business that these watchers might have. \nThis I realized, when an\
  \ old man asked me after staring at me for some time, if I wanted lodging. I was\
  \ staying at my uncle\u2019s place, so a paid lodging wasn\u2019t required. \n\n\
  My uncle\u2019s flat was in Navi Mumbai and the truth was that I did not really\
  \ have any idea how to get there.\n \nIt was hot and with each step I walked it\
  \ was getting hotter, so I needed to drink something cold and if I do, I thought\
  \ I can also ask the shopkeeper how to get to Navi Mumbai. I therefore went inside\
  \ a bakery and asked the single shopkeeper, a dark man wearing long white dress\
  \ and sweating behind the counter for something cold and he suggested crushed watermelon.\
  \ I was a little hungry too and therefore agreed and he made me a glass of cold\
  \ watermelon. It tasted real good and he was a nice man and guided me correctly\
  \ and following his directions I was there at my uncle\u2019s flat.\nNavi Mumbai\
  \ felt a little cooler and my uncle\u2019s flat was really nice and comfortable.\
  \ It was a far from all the chaos of the city. My uncle explained that Navi Mumbai\
  \ was reclaimed landmass and it was a planned area of the city, so things never\
  \ got messy around here. He has been here in Mumbai for a long time and was living\
  \ alone because he came here without education. He felt that his marriageable age\
  \ is over by the time he was well-settled. He wasn\u2019t a sad man though.\n\n\
  He told me that I can take rest for a while and then take use his scooter to go\
  \ around Mumbai. I agreed and laid down to rest and that\u2019s when the trouble\
  \ began. My stomach did not feel good; the nice man\u2019s tasty, cold and crushed\
  \ watermelon was a mistake, it made me a slave to bathroom urges for four days and\
  \ my Mumbai trip got ruined. I had to be treated at a hospital.\n\nHowever, my fifth\
  \ day wasn\u2019t really my uncle told me that if I felt better he\u2019d take me\
  \ to see the \u201CQueen\u2019s Necklace\u201D; the seashore had the shape of the\
  \ necklace. It was peaceful out there and even though all the chaos of the city\
  \ was taking place behind, I could feel its rush was struggles of men who were trying\
  \ to make a living; that it was about the undying spirit of the city. The city was\
  \ that of people like my uncle and I didn\u2019t expect to find peace here."
