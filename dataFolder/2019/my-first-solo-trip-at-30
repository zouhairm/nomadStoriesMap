Text: "A m\xE9lange of thoughts rushed into my mind when the train lurched to a halt\
  \ at Udaipur Station. As I stepped out of train with a suitcase heavier than me,\
  \ I was rattled and thrilled at the same time for this was the first solo trip of\
  \ my life. I, a 30 year old married woman, had decided to go on a trip all alone.\
  \ I had quit my job, had had a fallout with one of my closest friends, and absolutely\
  \ had no idea where life was heading. I was an archetype of quarter life crisis.\
  \ All I wanted was to be with my own company. \nThis was my first trip to Udaipur,\
  \ the historic capital of the former princely state of Mewar in Rajasthan, India.\
  \ Also known as the \xC7ity of Lakes, Udaipur is surrounded with azure water lakes\
  \ and hemmed in the lush hills of the Aravalis. \nFor this trip, I decided to stay\
  \ in a hostel instead of a hotel, as in hostels one can enjoy the camaraderie of\
  \ fellow backpackers. \nMy room had four bunker beds. My roommates were globetrotters\
  \ and all three were on solo trip. Their exhilarating experiences strengthened my\
  \ decision of going solo. \nNext day I set out for the city exploration early at\
  \ 7 AM while my other roomies were still asleep. I decided to first visit the most\
  \ famous attraction of Udaipur, the City Palace. \nThe flamboyant City Palace, which\
  \ was built nearly 400 years ago was the palace of several rulers of Mewar Dynasty.\
  \ It is one of the architectural marvels of Rajasthan and is perched on the banks\
  \ of Pichola Lake. Every corner of the City Palace has a story to tell, therefore\
  \ it\u2019s important to take either an audio or a personal guide. As I was alone\
  \ and wouldn\u2019t have minded a company, I opted for a personal guide. After paying\
  \ cash, a guide named Rohit was assigned to me. He took my entrance ticket and kept\
  \ it in his pocket as he wanted my hands and mind to be free and focus on the visit.\
  \ \nThe moment we entered, he started parroting the information. By the time he\
  \ was on his third sentence, by brain was still processing the first. I gave up\
  \ listening to him attentively and instead started marveling at the sheer beauty\
  \ of this palace. \nAlthough it was October but the scorching heat (41 degree Celsius)\
  \ started baking me. My throat was parched. Rohit noticed that I hadn\u2019t brought\
  \ any water to drink so he asked me to wait in the shade while he goes out to buy\
  \ a bottle of water for me. I smiled at his benevolence. While he was gone, a couple\
  \ of tourists asked me to click their photos. And in return, they clicked mine.\
  \ By this time, 15 minutes had passed and suddenly it struck me that my ticket was\
  \ with Rohit. He hasn\u2019t returned yet. I panicked. Has he tricked me? He has\
  \ my ticket, he can easily sell it to someone else outside and sneak inside in the\
  \ throng without being noticed. I cursed myself at my naivety. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ what to do. Should I go out and find him? Or should I just continue my visit and\
  \ hope no one asks for ticket inside the palace. I felt cheated. I stood there disappointingly\
  \ when I saw a faint reflection of a man looking like Rohit running towards me.\
  \ He was drenched in sweat. He told me that he couldn\u2019t get cold water nearby\
  \ so he went to the market to buy. He requested me to drink water. I took a sip\
  \ and urged him to drink from my bottle. He hesitated but after I insisted, he took\
  \ a sip. We continued our journey. I chided myself for being so skeptical and judgmental.\
  \ \nMy first solo trip turned out to be a mixed bag of varied experiences but from\
  \ that I understood that sometimes you have to take a leap of faith. To evolve as\
  \ a human it\u2019s important to explore the unknown terrains, to challenge your\
  \ fears and embrace every moment that entails a lesson with it."
