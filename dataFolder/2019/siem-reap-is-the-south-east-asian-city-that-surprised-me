Text: "There are many things we look for in our next holiday destination \u2013 white\
  \ sand beaches, bustling night markets full of the weird and wonderful, or a fabulous\
  \ yoga program \u2013 but a first impression that reads along the lines of \"oh\
  \ no, why did I do this?\u201D is probably never one of them. It was not the first\
  \ impression I had hoped for, but flying over the arid red countryside of Siem Reap\
  \ for the first time, I just couldn\u2019t find it in me to be excited about this\
  \ new destination that I was finally adding to my list. \n\nIn my mind, I would\
  \ be arriving in the land of ancient temple ruins and green, rice paddy-covered\
  \ farmland, where monks wandered about their ornate pagodas in orange robes and\
  \ tuk tuk drivers rested peacefully in their vehicles beside the river. Call me\
  \ na\xEFve, but the barren red land I could spy through my airplane window was nothing\
  \ like I had envisaged. \n\nMy stomach felt heavy at the sight of the dusty expanse\
  \ of land. My heart started racing, and I began to think that perhaps I had booked\
  \ my tickets to Siem Reap a little too hastily. Was this really where I was going\
  \ to be spending my next 6 nights?\n\nWith a desire to experience something new\
  \ burning stronger than the cognitive dissonance, I squeezed on to the rickety little\
  \ tuk tuk luggage and all, and soldiered on into town. It wasn\u2019t long before\
  \ the dusty national highway route gave way to greener, bustling little caf\xE9\
  -lined streets, and my initial hesitations turned in to intrigue, then into excitement.\
  \ \n\nSiem Reap still wasn\u2019t what I was expecting, it was even better.\n\n\
  Weaving through the streets of main town and towards my hotel, the best of inner-city\
  \ Siem Reap was put on display. Densely built and swarming with people, this was\
  \ more like the south east Asian cities I was familiar with. It was still covered\
  \ in the telltale red Siem Reap dust, but it was more tropically green (thanks to\
  \ the Siem Reap River that runs through), more populated and a lot more liveable\
  \ than the Siem Reap I had spied from the plane. \n\nThe city greeted me with a\
  \ loud symphony of tuk tuks, car horns and busses, and an eclectic mix of multi-story,\
  \ florescent-lit tech stores, old French colonial facades, and tiny street carts\
  \ selling all sorts of goodies from smoothies to noodles and grilled meats. Just\
  \ behind the tourist-filled \u2019Pub Street\u2019, monks were going about their\
  \ daily business in their quiet pagodas. Kids were riding rusty old bicycles to\
  \ school in their perfectly crisp, white school shirts, tuk tuk drivers were kipping\
  \ in hammocks slung across their rides, and big luxury tour coaches shared the roads\
  \ with old rattling trucks. It was the perfect juxtaposition of old and new, calm\
  \ and chaotic. \n\nWithin minutes of being in the heart of the city, I could pick\
  \ the tell-tale signs of Siem Reap\u2019s many ruling bodies everywhere. It was\
  \ in the architecture, in the food and even in their very Thai looking alphabet.\
  \ The city spoke of its tumultuous history from the get go. Yet, despite their many\
  \ years of very apparent battles and suffering through one of the worst genocides\
  \ in history, there was not one Cambodian person I met that wasn\u2019t gentle,\
  \ humble and kind. \n\nIt was the people and the conversations that transpired over\
  \ the 6 days I was in Siem Reap that really made me fall in love with the city.\
  \ The bustling city centre and tree lined Siem Reap River may have had me do a complete\
  \ 180 on my first airplane impression, but the nature of the people was what took\
  \ me right back to where I started with my initial hesitations about the country.\
  \ The guilt about my first thoughts set in and I had to sit back and ask myself\
  \ \u201Coh no, why did I do that?\u201D."
