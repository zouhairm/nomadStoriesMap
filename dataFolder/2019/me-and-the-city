Text: "Well you know, the big Apple, everyone has been talking about it. It has been\
  \ seen in so many movies, series, documentaries... I needed to see it by myself.\
  \ \nI was turning 25, had enough money to pay the trip. I did not hesitate when\
  \ he told me let\u2019s go !\nNew York City is as amazing as they say. Big, huge,\
  \ enormous I would say. Fact : the city never sleeps. I understood it on top of\
  \ the Empire State Building at 1 am the night of my birthday. This night we had\
  \ dinner in a local restaurant sharing food with real New Yorker, americans. Even\
  \ though our countries are rich, even though we share a lot of values. I realized\
  \ that each countries have different cultures. \nDuring the day, we walked into\
  \ Central Park : the lung of the city. I could have stayed there forever, admiring\
  \ squirrels and this nature surrounded by skyscrapers. \nI went to all museum I\
  \ could. New York wealth resides in all the cultures you can find. It is all mixed\
  \ up. From a street to another the atmosphere changes, you never know what you will\
  \ find around the corner. \nAt nights, the lights are taking over. The big apple\
  \ is shiny, so shiny ! Yellow, blue, orange, red... the rainbow is bright and you\
  \ feel no fear. \nOn Sunday, in Harlem, the bells are ringing for the mess. Gospel\
  \ is sung, time for a healthy brunch.\nAnd then it is time to leave. The party is\
  \ over, we were already on our way to Newark airport. \nI will never forget this\
  \ first time there. So bad that I am coming back. This time I am bringing my alla\
  \ family with me, my new camera and so many hopes to find out more about New York\
  \ and the city."
