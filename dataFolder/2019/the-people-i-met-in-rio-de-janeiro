Text: "Nearly a decade ago, I flew to Rio de Janeiro with less than two hours\u2019\
  \ notice and only my handbag for company. I was in my early twenties at the time,\
  \ working on the reception of a business based in Luxembourg. It was the middle\
  \ of the summer holidays; few calls were coming in \u2013 it was a hot and boring\
  \ day, and I\u2019d been shuffling work around that I wasn\u2019t wholly committed\
  \ to. Otherwise, it was business as usual: documents were signed, the phone was\
  \ answered, and coffees were poured for visitors. \n\nI was preparing to go home\
  \ when our Managing Director sprinted out of his office, breathless and a bit panicked.\
  \ He had some documents that needed to be delivered to a legal firm in Rio de Janeiro\
  \ at latest by 9 am local time the next morning. I called all the couriers in Luxembourg,\
  \ and none of them could commit to getting the documents there in time. \n\nWhen\
  \ I shared the news with my boss, he blanched slightly \u2013 as sometimes happens\
  \ in the corporate world, there were no go-arounds: the papers had to be in Rio,\
  \ and they had to be there at 9 am the next day. The only option left, he said,\
  \ was to have someone from our office fly to Rio and deliver the documents in person.\
  \ \n\nAs a foreigner in Luxembourg, I dutifully carried my passport around with\
  \ me at all times, in case I was stopped and requested to provide proof of identity.\
  \ Fishing my passport from my handbag, I volunteered to make the trip to Rio. We\
  \ quickly called a travel agent and managed to book the last seat on the last flight\
  \ departing that day from Luxembourg to Paris and on to Brazil. I collected the\
  \ papers and got into a taxi to the airport. \n\nI delivered the documents in Rio\
  \ the next morning, and as a treat, I was allowed to stay on for a few days in the\
  \ city, which is perhaps where this story really begins. \n\nRio is an amazing place.\
  \ It was winter, but still sticky hot \u2013 I came home sunburnt, although I\u2019\
  ve since been told I was lucky with the weather. \n\nI remember it felt like the\
  \ jungle came down to meet the city, and I was surprised by the rocky outcrops that\
  \ buildings are perched around, even a few blocks back from the sea. I drank sharp\
  \ Caipirinhas on the beach in the evenings and bought Ipanema flip flops to relieve\
  \ my feet of the heels I\u2019d left the office in. \n\nI explored as much as I\
  \ could, including a visit to Corcovado Mountain which looms above the city. The\
  \ Cristo Redentor is as stunning as you\u2019d expect it to be, but in retrospect,\
  \ I preferred to admire it from afar, rather than just beneath it with jostling\
  \ crowds vying for space to get the top of the statue into their pictures.\n\nI\u2019\
  m not sure if it\u2019s because I travelled unexpectedly, or because I was alone,\
  \ that I met so many brilliant people while I was in Rio. \n\nAn Australian lady\
  \ I sat next to on the flight gave me a lift into the city when we arrived \u2013\
  \ I still have her business card somewhere. I\u2019m not a football fan, but I went\
  \ to watch a football match at the Maracan\xE3 Stadium anyway; I sat next to two\
  \ consultants visiting Brazil from Europe who invited me to eat with them the same\
  \ evening. We ate beautiful fresh fish and drank local wine \u2013 I don\u2019t\
  \ remember if it was any good, although the company was. A group of British teenagers\
  \ who were travelling after they\u2019d finished their exams watched my towel, phone\
  \ and hotel key on the beach one day, so I could go swimming in the sea (it was\
  \ soupy warm, but surprisingly rough). \n\nI never did know what documents I delivered,\
  \ or why they were so important, but I loved Rio, and I\u2019d go again in a heartbeat.\
  \ \n\nSometimes, the best travel experiences are the ones you never expected to\
  \ have."
