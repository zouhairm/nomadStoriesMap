Text: "As a child born into an inter-faith family, I had some liberty to choose what\
  \ I wanted to follow. As I grew up, I evolved as a spiritual person. While I have\
  \ always been curious to visit spiritual places and seek solace, it was few days\
  \ of traveling across states in India that left a deep impact on me- on many levels.\n\
  I hated it when some people I know told me that women can\u2019t travel alone, or\
  \ shouldn\u2019t travel alone. And even if women can, I was never considered to\
  \ be the kind to fit into that profile! I always cherished the idea of going somewhere\
  \ by myself, exploring a new city, maybe a new country and its culture, taste the\
  \ cuisine, experience the local culture and return home with memories and handful\
  \ of souvenirs. In 2016, I had decided that it I could no longer ignore the longings\
  \ in my heart and I embarked on my first solo trip to Dharamshala in India. I. As\
  \ a feminist, I wanted to crush the stereotype against women traveling alone.\n\
  After a few months, I woke up one fine morning to embark on an interfaith trip.\
  \ I had few places in mind, including the Golden Temple in Amritsar, one of the\
  \ most important pilgrimage site of Sikhism. I was supposed to travel back to Bangladesh\
  \ in few days but I knew I wanted to go to all these places before I went home for\
  \ a vacation. So the same day, I did a quick research on internet and by evening,\
  \ I packed my backpack and boarded a bus to Amritsar at night. In South Asia, a\
  \ woman traveling alone most often trigger curiosity everywhere she goes and my\
  \ story was no different. I got curious stares when the bus stopped at midnight\
  \ for a break and I sat on a table alone with a plate of Rajma Chawal(red kidney\
  \ beans with thick gravy and rice). But I carried on with a brave face and I reached\
  \ Amritsar in the morning. The moment I entered the temple, I felt at home. The\
  \ tranquility was soothing, despite the crowd. I prayed and I sat with my eyes closed\
  \ for hours before I left the place. My next stop was the famous Wagah border between\
  \ India and Pakistan. As a student interested in conflict and peace, I was always\
  \ curious to go there. And I again returned to the temple in the evening to spend\
  \ some more time in bliss before I boarded a bus back to Delhi around 10 pm at night.\
  \ While my soul was at peace, at the same time I felt an adrenaline rush because\
  \ of the thrill of traveling by myself to a place I have never been to.\nThe next\
  \ place I wanted to go to was Ajmer Dargah, famous Sufi Shrine located in Ajmer\
  \ City, which is in another state, and I thought of going back to Delhi and taking\
  \ few hours of rest before I sat off again. While I was packing my bag for Ajmer,\
  \ a friend texted me that she wants to join me and I agreed. Even though now I was\
  \ no longer alone, it was still a thrill because this was the first girls\u2019\
  \ trip in my life to a faraway city, with a friend who was equally adventurous and\
  \ did not know the place well either. We only had few hours to plan a trip not only\
  \ to the Sufi Shrine, but we also decided to go to another city nearby to visit\
  \ Brahma temple. Thus, in a span of 3 days, I ended up traveling to some holy sites\
  \ of three faiths- Hinduism, Islam and Sikhism. And being a woman traveling alone\
  \ for the first part, and traveling with another woman who is equally adventurous\
  \ led to an interesting experience where I tasted spiritual peace and adventure\
  \ at the same time. \nI never expected to experience spiritual peace and adventure\
  \ at the same time. But this is what I experienced and I can never forget my journey\
  \ from Amritsar to Ajmer."
