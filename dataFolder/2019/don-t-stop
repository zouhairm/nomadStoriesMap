Text: "I\u2019ve always been an excessively anxious person. Worrying was second-nature\
  \ to me. So, when it came time to jet-set for the first time without my parents\
  \ in tow, I was beyond apprehensive. This wasn\u2019t for some lavish whirlwind\
  \ tour of a tantalising city. This was a mission trip to aid some of the most deeply\
  \ affected areas of a post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia. \n\nAs the old rusted and rattling\
  \ van swept past fields of thriving green rice paddies and unadulterated countryside,\
  \ my mind rested on what atrocities this idyllic backdrop could be rehabilitating.\
  \ As we pulled through a sky-blue gate and onto a dirt road driveway, I didn\u2019\
  t expect to see such vibrant painted wood cabins fashioned like treehouses. This\
  \ was Sunshine House, an orphanage 90 minutes outside of Phnom Penh, and home to\
  \ over 50 exploited and abandoned children. It was so far removed from my pre-conceived\
  \ notions of an orphanage. It was a sanctuary; a refuge.\n\nFrom day one, I had\
  \ come to befriend a gentle seven-year-old girl named Ann*. She often tied knots\
  \ in the long slick black hair that enveloped her tiny frame. Behind her wide onyx\
  \ eyes, I witnessed the internal battle between maintaining any shred of innocence\
  \ or becoming overcome by the abuses of her past. She didn\u2019t speak any English,\
  \ and I very little Khmer, but we had a means of communicating beyond words. She\
  \ adored music, and it was our thing we shared. I showed her the likes of anything\
  \ from The Beatles to Hilary Duff. Her favourites were always by Fleetwood Mac.\
  \ \n\nLater into our stay, the team and the kids limbered up for a considerable\
  \ trek up a nearby mountain. The house parents gushed about the enchanting views\
  \ that awaited us at its peak. Standing at the foot of the mountain, the brown dirt\
  \ tracks, tall shrubbery and disintegrating boulders masked the colossal incline.\n\
  \n\u201CJust be mindful you stay on the designated track. This whole mountain hasn\u2019\
  t been swept for landmines,\u201D one parent directed. The orphanage group had made\
  \ this hike many times but always needed to account for any stray hooligans. \n\n\
  Only moments into our trek, I found myself losing momentum, having sorely misjudged\
  \ both the steepness of the mountain and the distance to the top. The lingering\
  \ threat of rogue landmines also didn\u2019t help. The racing heart, shallow breath\
  \ and panicked mindset in. I suddenly couldn\u2019t tell up from down. Much of the\
  \ team were already miles ahead, while others were stopping frequently throughout\
  \ their ascent. At this point, it was only Ann and me. She never left my side the\
  \ whole time, even though I know she could\u2019ve lapped that mountain twice in\
  \ the time it took me to get up there once. \n\nNoticing my sudden halt in the journey,\
  \ Ann grabbed my hand, squeezing it as if to say, \u201CAre you okay?\u201D I managed\
  \ a half smile back at her and pointed to a nearby boulder jutting out from the\
  \ side of the track. I had to sit down, despite the jagged stiffness. Ann waited,\
  \ standing patiently beside me. The pulsating of my chest and the ringing in my\
  \ ears deafened any hubbub at the top. I had to calm myself down before I took any\
  \ step further. \n\nA shy and gentle humming of Don\u2019t Stop by Fleetwood Mac\
  \ disrupted the ringing. Ann had memorised the tune and was now speaking to me through\
  \ it. She didn\u2019t understand the lyrics, but it\u2019s almost as if she knew\
  \ that was the tune that I needed to hear to get me through. Her gentle black eyes\
  \ stared at me with an acknowledgement of my fears. She didn\u2019t speak English,\
  \ I spoke very little Khmer, but through the music, Ann kept me moving even when\
  \ it felt like I couldn\u2019t. \n\nWe made it to the top of that mountain, singing\
  \ and humming away to all the songs I had shown her in the days before. Time escaped\
  \ us as we stood there, our eyes fixated on the technicolour landscapes of crystal\
  \ lagoons, forest fields and a gradient sky. There we stood in silent triumph; humble,\
  \ calm and free.\n\n*Name has been changed to protect the privacy of the individual."
