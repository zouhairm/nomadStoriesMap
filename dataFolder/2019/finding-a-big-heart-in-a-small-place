Text: "Walking down the narrow streets of Rijeka, Croatia with my brother, we were\
  \ taking in the occasional glimpses to the glittery sea. Our travel plan was to\
  \ keep away from the tourist magnets and stay in an Airbnb, go to the local supermarkets\
  \ and cook by precisely following local recipes. It was magnificent, the smallness\
  \ of the country and the vibrant flora surrounding us, away from the usual high\
  \ streets. \nOn one afternoon, I had to pop by the pharmacy for some extra sunscreen\
  \ as we were not exactly used to the heat. As I got out there was a woman in her\
  \ late 60s sat outside the drugstore, she asked me if I had any water and I just\
  \ so happened to have some. I handed her the bottle and she drank all of it. It\
  \ felt like I could not leave, she handed the empty bottle back to me and when I\
  \ asked if she spoke any more English, she nodded. I sat next to her and asked further\
  \ if she was feeling alright she did not seem to be very talkative. She wore a worn-out\
  \ shirt and crocs on her feet, looking like she was in need of more water. I was\
  \ ready to go back in and tell someone about her but she stopped me before I could\
  \ rush away and started telling me about herself in broken but quite understandable\
  \ English. \nShe had two sons, both had married foreign women and she had a total\
  \ of seven grandchildren two of which she had never met. She was a widow and said\
  \ that she loved living here at home but she misses the world and the time when\
  \ distance and money were not an issue. I was blown away by how open she was and\
  \ how easily she could tell all this to a complete stranger like me. She told me\
  \ she had seen me walking down this same street with a young man before and I told\
  \ her it was my brother. She smiled and said that her sons were just like the two\
  \ of us: walking and laughing and all the while, not really knowing what the life\
  \ ahead of us will bring. She said that perhaps someday I - a foreign girl myself\
  \ - would end up here just like her sons had ended up somewhere far away, too. She\
  \ believed that there ought to be a balance somewhere with all this travelling of\
  \ the new generations.\nI was unbelievably touched by her presence, her story and\
  \ her incredible worldview. The pure heart of a mother simply missing her sons and\
  \ telling her story to someone she felt was similar. I could not find any words\
  \ that could even come close to her wisdom and the kindness of her heart. I left\
  \ her feeling somehow guilty but also thankful that I handed her that bottle of\
  \ water in the first place."
