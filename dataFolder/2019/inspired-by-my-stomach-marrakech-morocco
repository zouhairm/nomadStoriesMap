Text: "My travel experiences tend to be heavily weighted on food. Food allows individuals\
  \ to experience culture through many senses: taste, smell, sight, and touch. All\
  \ my fondest memories of my travels have centered on food-related adventures. A\
  \ meal of fried kreplah (fired ravioli with beef) or Kofta (medallions of lamb served\
  \ with lettuce) at the Ariel restaurant in Krakow, Poland located in Kazimierz,\
  \ the old Jewish district. A pizza topped with rocket lettuce, an egg and mushrooms\
  \ served on a terrace in Venice, Italy overlooking the water. A schnitzel from one\
  \ of the many stands at the Frankfurt, Germany Christmas markets. Starting my morning\
  \ in Edinburgh, Scotland with a bacon sarnie (back bacon sandwiched in a bun) to\
  \ energize before going to see Arthurs Seat. If you would like a snippet into my\
  \ adventures in Marrakech, Morocco and the food I ate while there, read on.\nMarrakech,\
  \ Morocco offers travelers the opportunity to stroll around a beautiful open market\
  \ square which can overwhelm newcomers with the hectic sounds and smells. You can\
  \ pick up a fresh bag of apricots, nuts or olives from an open stall to snack on\
  \ as you walk around taking in the many items for sale. This country located in\
  \ North Africa has speakers fluent in Arabic and French. My French-Canadian background\
  \ allowed me to communicate with a little girl who was the daughter of a family\
  \ who owned a camel riding company. She was very enthralled by my name and ability\
  \ to speak her first language \u201CComme la petite sir\xE8ne?\u201D (\u201CLike\
  \ the little mermaid?\u201D) \n\nOne of the evenings, my stepdad asked the cab driver\
  \ to take us to the best local restaurant for dinner we followed him trustingly\
  \ down multiple tiny alleyways and to a big door with no visible signage. We journeyed\
  \ down a long hallway to stairs that led to a basement which led to a restaurant\
  \ that made me feel as though I was in a trance from start to finish. There were\
  \ colorful cushions to sit on at low down tables while live music played in the\
  \ background. Late in the evening, there was belly dancing. I couldn\u2019t tell\
  \ you how long we were there for as it felt as though time paused. Dish after dish\
  \ arrived at our table. Silver bowls filled to the brim with couscous intertwined\
  \ with vegetables. A lamb dish that combined prunes which provided a sweet side\
  \ to a savory dish. There is very little chance we would have found this restaurant\
  \ on our own. It felt like we stepped into a dream world upon entry. We never did\
  \ catch the name and I would love to go back to see if I could find it again.\n\n\
  There were quite a few assumptions that my family would enjoy American cuisine.\
  \ Several restaurants asked if we wanted the \u201CAmerican menu\u201D, which consisted\
  \ of fries, hot dogs, pizza and so on. The first time we were asked we presumed\
  \ an American menu to be an English menu but realized quickly that it just meant\
  \ fast food.\n\nOn our last night, we decided to eat in the beautiful market square\
  \ filled with vendors selling food, artwork and other household items. We sat at\
  \ an outdoor stalls table where you could order items such as pastries, rice, and\
  \ meat off open-air stands. After we all finished a hearty helping of a delicious,\
  \ tasty meat dish we noticed the cook pick up food that had dropped off his cart\
  \ on to the cobblestone and put it back on the cart to be sold. Suffice to say,\
  \ I also became familiar with Marrakech bathrooms. All that considered, Marrakech\
  \ is a city I\u2019ve thought about frequently when daydreaming in cold Canadian\
  \ weather. There were way too many foods I didn\u2019t get a chance to try, although\
  \ if I return, I will be staying clear of any food picked up off cobblestones."
