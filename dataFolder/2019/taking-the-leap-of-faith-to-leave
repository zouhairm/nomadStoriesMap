Text: "Why I left:\n\nAs a stereotypical American, right out of High School I went\
  \ onto College, which is basically what you are taught to believe is the right course\
  \ of action for you if you want to get a good paying job. In some cases, true, but\
  \ in others not so much.  I graduated from a 4-year college with a bachelor\u2019\
  s degree. Although what I went to school for was interesting, it wasn\u2019t exactly\
  \ the career I saw myself doing for the rest of my life but of course I didn\u2019\
  t realize this until after receiving my diploma and racking up insane amounts of\
  \ debt. I mean, come on at the age of 18 how are you actually supposed to know what\
  \ you want to do with the rest of your life? There are lucky few in this world that\
  \ do but honestly that just wasn\u2019t me. \n\nI wanted more out of life and felt\
  \ like something was missing that I hadn\u2019t \u201Cfound myself\u201D yet, totally\
  \ clich\xE9, I know but at 23 I felt a bit lost. I didn\u2019t want to live in the\
  \ little Buffalo bubble where I did the same thing every day and where I lived my\
  \ life on repeat. After a year out of college living the work cycle, I had had enough.\
  \ It\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t happy, I just wanted more. \n\nOne of my greatest\
  \ friends was living this amazing life in San Diego at the time and one day while\
  \ on the phone with her discussing my \u201Clife problems\u201D she said \u201C\
  Meag, come live with me in San Diego! It would be so fun\u201D.  After hanging up\
  \ I sat in my garage petting my cats thinking \u201Cis that something I could actually\
  \ make happen?\u201D Well, I did.  \n\nThree months later I spontaneously packed\
  \ up my life, put it into my leased Nissan Rogue and drove across the country to\
  \ California. If you knew me then, you wouldn't believe I would ever do something\
  \ so \u201Ccrazy\u201D and leave Buffalo but I was at a point in my life where I\
  \ thought, why the hell not. I went to California in hopes that it was going to\
  \ change me, show me what I want out of life and give me an experience unlike any\
  \ other. \n\nBoy was I right.\n\n California, home of the palm trees, the beaches\
  \ and the endless warm breeze that blows though your constant sandy hair. Home of\
  \ some of the nicest people I have ever met, expat from all over the world and people\
  \ of every background you can imagine. I was able to experience a whole new realm\
  \ outside of my Buffalo bubble and one filled with friends who were completely different\
  \ from the ones I had lived my entire life at home with.\n\n I learned more in that\
  \ year about myself then I ever thought possible. I won\u2019t keep rambling on\
  \ about California, (I\u2019ll save that for later) but I will say it ended up being\
  \ the stepping stone that I needed to embark on the most epic adventure of my life.\n\
  \nNow that I had been able to experience this new life in San Diego, I still felt\
  \ there was something missing. I was a gymnastics coach at the time, but it was\
  \ hours I didn\u2019t want to work, and I never had weekends off. Worst of all I\
  \ was broke. So again, I felt stuck. I lived in paradise but financially could not\
  \ afford it and wasn\u2019t passionate about what I was truly getting out of life.\
  \ \n\nSpontaneity came through once again and I signed up for an online class to\
  \ get my Teaching English as a Foreign Language Certification. \n\nFast forward\
  \ 4 months\u2026 I was boarding my plane to the other side of the world on a one-way\
  \ ticket to teach English in Thailand. \n\nNow I know as you read this you probably\
  \ have a lot of questions. Hopefully these are some I can answer for you\u2026"
