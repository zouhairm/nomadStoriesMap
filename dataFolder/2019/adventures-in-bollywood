Text: "A sense of adventure, and a hope of fulfilling some performing dreams, has\
  \ brought me 9,815 kilometres away from my home of Melbourne to Bollywood, Mumbai,\
  \ where I will work as a dancer for the next six months. \n\nMumbai from the air\
  \ reveals kilometre after kilometre of slums, the muddy ground patch worked with\
  \ blue tarpaulin. These areas account for living, working and community spaces for\
  \ 42 percent of the 12.44 million-strong population. On the ground, the air is hot,\
  \ heavy with pollution, and smells of cows, traffic congestion and brewing chai.\
  \ A rickshaw takes me to the apartment that will be my new home. We pass scenes\
  \ of poverty and sickness; cows stand idly on the road, their skin hanging slack\
  \ from their bones, a small girl gathers water from a sewage drain. I can't look\
  \ at a family of eight, living on the side of the road, and feel positive about\
  \ my choice to come here as a dancer. I vow to give myself one month to make the\
  \ decision about whether to stay longer or not. \n\nThe next few weeks pass in a\
  \ blur of early call times to set, at \"Film City\", one of the largest Bollywood\
  \ shoot locations in the world. Home also, as I would learn, to the site of several\
  \ recent leopard attacks, and one fatality. One of my regular jobs has me playing\
  \ a cheerleader for the reality show \"Dance Champions\". I'm conscious of how short\
  \ my skirt is, and how close the first row of the live audience is sitting behind\
  \ me. All of the women in the audience are dressed modestly, and many of the men\
  \ wear turbans. The chaos is directed over a loudspeaker using a few high frequency\
  \ Hindi words and phrases. We become very familiar with \"challo\" (let's go) and\
  \ \"jaldi\" (fast). One day after work I get locked out of my apartment, and I find\
  \ myself very alone in a strange neighbourhood. My neighbours come out of their\
  \ flat and take me in to their place, insisting \"please don't cry, we are actually\
  \ very nice people\". They make me chapati and dahl, and convince the locksmith\
  \ to come out at one in the morning to let me in to my room. \n\nI put myself on\
  \ \"work hiatus\" as I wait for my overdue wage to come in. My bosses are part of\
  \ the 1% of the wealthy population in India, and I'm into my third day of eating\
  \ Vegemite on spaghetti for dinner. In the meantime, I sign myself up to do some\
  \ unpaid teaching at a local Catholic school. At first I'm too shy to speak over\
  \ the 40 excited voices chattering in Marathi. The kids sense my hesitation, and\
  \ file out of the room, chanting \"pani pani pani\" (drink) and holding a hand to\
  \ their mouth to sign for water. I muster up my confidence and soon we are building\
  \ shared words and phrases together. They love the animal guessing game- one student\
  \ sits at the front of the room and tries to guess, while others describe an animal\
  \ to them. \"Running fast... there is a tail... orange colour... black stripes...\
  \ sharp teeth\" are clues for \"tiger\". We sing \"Kookaburra Sits in the Old Gum\
  \ Tree\", and they say \"thank you, Teacher\" at the end of each lesson, hands together\
  \ and heads waggling. Every day, the older girls run to greet me in the yard, and\
  \ one time, illegally, I think, paint a sprawling henna tattoo on my arm. \n\nI\
  \ come back to work just in time for a shoot with one of the most well known and\
  \ respected choreographers in Bollywood. The shoot is at Film City again, but this\
  \ time, we are in a huge set created to look like a house party. We've been in rehearsals\
  \ for three days, and the shoot takes a further three days. I'm stoked that one\
  \ night, I'm one of a group who is asked to stay later, to be filler for a close\
  \ shot. If you pause the video at a certain time you can see me! At the time of\
  \ writing, the video has 391 million views."
