Text: "And so, you\u2019ve been asking me how it feels to be home as though there\u2019\
  s one standard emotion set to those that have just gone distances one had been dreaming\
  \ of for years. I\u2019ll begin with my apology for being vain, utterly repulsive\
  \ and needlessly dramatic but parts of me have died on this trip and parts of me\
  \ have come alive and to find the words to express such a wide variety of emotion\
  \ can\u2019t be done but I will tell you this: this world has done it again. I\u2019\
  ve arrived early to walk towards the morning light and I\u2019ve been recklessly\
  \ dropped, shattered and gutted to pieces. My hands shook anxiously for the chance\
  \ to study meaning, to experience it, to find truth and trust in pain, to find patience\
  \ in all that is unsolved, to feel alive again and be consciously, serenely aware\
  \ of it. I began craving the courage to show up in a world that hands out a silver-tongued\
  \ list of all things filled with danger and hatred, and then create a list of what\
  \ it means to see it all and still feel love.\n\nI found myself thinking more about\
  \ my own mortality than your average 22-year-old after listening to the news alerts\
  \ and strangers telling me how dangerous the world is, especially parts of the world\
  \ where poverty, disease, and violence are so raw and prevalent. When I really sat\
  \ down and contemplated my own death, I realized how necessary it was to go on,\
  \ how contemplation and acceptance is the greatest fuel for creating a fulfilling\
  \ life. And with becoming so acutely addicted to living, one\u2019s death cannot\
  \ deem a tragedy. To fall in love with a part of the world that so many people hold\
  \ clenched fists over became a task so necessary for me to receive a balance in\
  \ my own existence. And whatever happens, as a result, is better than the nothingness\
  \ that is inevitable with never leaving.\n\nThe megafauna and grasslands all together\
  \ made me feel young. The rhinos made me cry, the elephants inspired me, the hippos\
  \ made me feel brave, the leopards made me feel lucky, the lions were encouraging,\
  \ the gorillas made me feel wild, the bird\u2019s song were calming. And with my\
  \ two bare feet on the ground, staring at the setting bright red African sun, I\
  \ felt happy, for the lack of a better word, to witness an act that occurs in each\
  \ of our days, and be moved to tears. I like to believe that each joyous tear from\
  \ the human eye is a chance to be saved. And while I don\u2019t believe that traveling\
  \ can fully save anyone, I believe it can bring awareness to one needing to be saved.\
  \ And that moments precious enough to turn to memories are a part of that process\
  \ of being saved, of feeling happy to be alive.\n\nAnd when I want to go back, I\
  \ close my eyes and I can feel the swaying savanna around me, I can hear the crackling\
  \ of a warm fire and a lion\u2019s roar in the distance and I can imagine the silhouette\
  \ of an elephant standing before a bright orange setting sun and I can breathe again.\
  \ And I wonder how the seemingly impossible process of transitioning a dangerously\
  \ empty life to an extraordinary one can be as simple as buying a plane ticket to\
  \ Africa."
