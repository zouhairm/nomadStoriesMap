Text: "Me and my boyfriend were at the end of our one-month trip to Colombia and we\
  \ pass for a lot of problems that are part of the routine of those who decide to\
  \ travel on their own. We had a problem with a host in Bogota, we passed a traffic\
  \ jam on the road to Medellin for over 13 hours, we lost suitcases, not to mention\
  \ almost missed buses with closed time to travel, and that makes every minute of\
  \ the trip be more exciting and intense and try to make the most of the little time\
  \ that you have to travel compared to the rest of the year where do you have to\
  \ work to join more money and then travel again and start this vicious circle. \n\
  \        And that is exactly what I was thinking when I arrived in Salento, a small\
  \ town in Colombia that just have a few urban streets and a great region of nature\
  \ with a great attraction that is the \u201CValle de Cocora\u201D.\n        In that\
  \ day we were trying to think in good option to go the Valle, that include the possibility\
  \ to not spend money on the bus passage to the place because we had already had\
  \ some financial problems during the trip, so we decided in our hostel that we would\
  \ make the way back and forth from the hostel to the Valley and from the valley\
  \ to the hostel walking. \n        As we were walking during the morning in Salento\
  \ to the Valle, after two blocks from the hostel we were already in the rural area\
  \ of the city, and as we were walking, we realized how long it would take the road,\
  \ after two hours walking, a Colombian family offered us ride to the Cocora Valley.\n\
  \tAnd you always have those first obvious questions of travelers: what's your name?\
  \ What country are you from? What do you think about Colombia? What is your next\
  \ destination? And after many conversations they offered us fruit in the car and\
  \ tips on the city, the most interesting part of traveling is the possibility of\
  \ one day being extremely good as being extremely bad, but this day was a good day!\
  \ And I just realized there, in a small car with unknown people how much have helpful\
  \ people on the road who are just there to pass on knowledge, good vibes and travel\
  \ stories.\n         After we arrived in Valle, I began to feel that sense of end\
  \ of the travel, and to feel warm about the energy of the place and everything was\
  \ mixed with the vision of the enormous \u201CPalma de Cera\u201D I could only think\
  \ about good memories of the trip, and forget about all the problems and just trying\
  \ to relax (and this is almost impossible when you have to decide about the bus\
  \ tickets, hostels, money to eat, drink e etc\u2026.). \n         After four hours\
  \ walking in the Cocora Valley, it was almost late afternoon, which meant that we\
  \ should walk back to the urban center of Salento to get at least part of the way\
  \ in the clear and the other count on the luck of the phone flashlight. Three more\
  \ hours walking back to the hostel (that didn\u2019t have hot shower, with only\
  \ pasta in the refrigerator), we arrived there we found those friends that we make\
  \ in the hostel (that we want to take the energy of those people for life), and\
  \ they welcomed us with beer and ping-pong you got a better plan in the night than\
  \ this one? \n        Moments like this describe the absence of an absurd need for\
  \ money to travel but rather know how to enjoy with what has and mainly try to seek\
  \ to bring the knowledge and intensity of the experience of living for the rest\
  \ of the year, and then try to travel again."
