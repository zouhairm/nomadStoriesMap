Text: "It\u2019s been said that the two best parts of traveling are the experiences\
  \ and the people. For an introvert like myself, the experiences make sense; but\
  \ how can greeting someone at a pub compare with exploring the halls of Neuschwanstein?\
  \ Such an ordinary thing can be done anywhere. Until the day I found myself in Antwerp\
  \ looking for food. There, I had an encounter that taught me to be unapologetically\
  \ myself and ultimately opened me up to meeting new people on the rest of my journey.\n\
  \nI had been wandering the city all day, and although I entered a shop hoping to\
  \ find a sandwich, I was greeted with wall-to-wall chocolate. The shopkeeper welcomed\
  \ me with a huge smile and a plate of samples. While I snacked, she asked me the\
  \ typical traveler questions, and shared a bit about herself. Her name was Sandra,\
  \ and although originally from Argentina, she left to escape her husband and raise\
  \ her two daughters alone. And as it turns out Belgium was not her only home either\u2014\
  she had also lived in America, Italy, and Germany. With that, we had uncovered our\
  \ mutual passion for traveling.\n\nThe conversation flowed so naturally that she\
  \ suddenly asked, \u201CHow would you like a home-cooked meal?\u201D The introvert\
  \ in me tensed immediately. How was this woman so open? Why would she invite me\
  \ to her home when we barely know each other? There had to be a hidden reason. I\
  \ hesitantly accepted. After all, she was so kind; maybe dinner wouldn\u2019t be\
  \ so bad. \n\nShe said we needed to run an errand first. I felt a little uncomfortable,\
  \ particularly when I found out that it was the doctor\u2019s office. This seemed\
  \ a bit too personal for a stranger. Ironically, the doctor confirmed that she had\
  \ an allergy to chocolate, which seemed to amuse her and brought some levity  to\
  \ the situation. My apprehension was nearly gone and I felt as though I had run\
  \ errands with an aunt.\n\nAll of that comfort disappeared when I entered her home,\
  \ because my American sensibilities reminded me that this was not normal. If Sandra\
  \ noticed my hesitance, she didn\u2019t show it as she set to work on dinner. I\
  \ jumped in to help, hoping it would distract me from how awkward I felt. \n\nMaybe\
  \ it was the food, or maybe it was Sandra\u2019s ever-present smile, but I began\
  \ to share more about my life. Before I knew it, I was telling her about finishing\
  \ university and the recent passing of my grandmother, moving across the US and\
  \ the search for meaning that led me across the world. During a pause she told me\
  \ that I reminded her of her son\u2014kind hearted, considerate of others, and handsome.\
  \ But by the somber tone she used, I could tell that something wasn\u2019t quite\
  \ right, though. I was afraid to hear what came next, but I knew I needed to ask\
  \ the question: \u201CWhere is he now?\u201D\n\nWith tears in her eyes, she confessed\
  \ that he had passed away in a motorcycle accident. As she told what happened I\
  \ couldn\u2019t stop the tears welling in my eyes as well. Sandra looked up at me\
  \ with tears rolling down her face and her big smile, and I realized her secret\
  \ reason: she offered to make me dinner because she saw her son in me. I smiled\
  \ back to show her how much I too was grateful she invited me for dinner. \n\nI\
  \ am still not an extrovert, but my evening with Sandra taught me something that\
  \ traversing the Alps never would have. It was a lesson about universal human experience\u2014\
  an innate camaraderie with other people that evolves from continuously meeting and\
  \ talking with strangers. It's this trait that allows travelers to make quick and\
  \ lasting friendships; age, profession, social status, and other barriers that would\
  \ normally hinder us melt away. The trust I built with Sandra opened me up to relationships\
  \ in other countries that I would have surely missed otherwise, and although I never\
  \ got my sandwich, I left Antwerp with something much more valuable: a mutual respect\
  \ for the other person\u2019s experience and the determination to finish my journey."
