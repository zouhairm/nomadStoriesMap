  \ is the Burj Khalifa, which at 829.8 meters is the tallest building in the world\
  \ and the most famous of the city's points of interest. For most visitors, a trip\
  \ to the observation deck on the 124th floor here is a must-do while in the city.\
  \ The views across the city skyline from this bird's-eye perspective are simply\
  \ staggering. The slick observation deck experience includes a multimedia presentation\
  \ on both Dubai and the building of the Burj Khalifa (completed in 2010) before\
  \ a high-speed elevator whizzes you up to the observation deck for those 360-degree\
  \ views out across the skyscrapers to the desert on one side and the ocean on the\
  \ other.\nDubai Mall is the city's premier mall and provides entry to the Burj Khalifa,\
  \ as well as the Dubai Aquarium. There is also an ice-skating rink, gaming zone,\
  \ and cinema complex if you're looking for more entertainment options. The shopping\
  \ and eating is endless, and there are nearly always special events such as live\
  \ music and fashion shows within the mall. The most famous of these are the annual\
  \ Dubai Shopping Festival in January and February and the Dubai Summer Surprises\
  \ Festival in July and August.\nDubai's excellent museum is housed in the Al-Fahidi\
  \ Fort, built in 1787 to defend Dubai Cree\nJumeirah Mosque is considered by many\
  \ to be the most beautiful of Dubai's mosques. An exact copy of Cairo's Al-Azhar\
  \ Mosque, which is eight times its size, the Jumeirah Mosque is a fine example of\
  \ Islamic architecture\nSitting slap-bang between Dubai's older neighborhoods clustered\
  \ around the creek and the city's modern sprawl, this ginormous 150-meter-high picture\
  \ frame is one of Dubai's latest sights. Inside, a series of galleries whisk you\
  \ through the city's history and explore Emirati heritage before you travel up to\
  \ the Sky Deck, where there are fantastic panoramas of both old and new Dubai to\
  \ be snapped on the viewing platforms.\nSheikh Zayed Road is the main thoroughfare\
  \ running through Dubai's modern downtown business district. This wide, eight-lane\
  \ highway is rimmed with towering glass, chrome, and steel high-rises along its\
  \ entire length. It's one of the best on-the-ground vantage points for Dubai's famed\
  \ skyscraper views.\nOne of the city's top tourist attractions, the Dubai Aquarium\
  \ houses 140 species of sea life in the huge suspended tank on the ground floor\
  \ of the Dubai Mall. As well as free viewing from the mall, if you enter the Underwater\
  \ Zoo, you can walk through the aquarium tunnels.\nMall of the Emirates is one of\
  \ the city's most famous malls, with the spectacular (and surreal) Ski Dubai facility\
  \ inside. The indoor ski slope is complete with chairlifts and a penguin enclosure,\
  \ all at a continuous temperature of -4 degrees Celsius. There's also a cinema complex\
  \ and a family entertainment center with a whole host of rides aimed at both the\
  \ big and small. The shopping opportunities are boundless, as are the eating options,\
  \ offering every conceivable world cuisine.\n Dubai is the fourth most visited places\
  \ in the world"
