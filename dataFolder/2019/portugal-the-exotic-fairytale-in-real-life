Text: "Portugal is truly the romanticized fairytale image of how classic Europe is\
  \ imagined. Hands down, it is one of the most scenic places in the world. The vibe,\
  \ culture, architecture, beaches, people, exceeded my expectations.\n\nDriving through\
  \ the countryside of Portugal I was hit with an intense sense of bliss, as I sat\
  \ in silence enjoying the present moment. I felt unbelievably fortunate to have\
  \ the ability to travel the world and make memories that I will cherish for the\
  \ rest of my life. To me, this is a priceless experience. Through me, you can vicariously\
  \ enjoy travelling the world, however, I hope to inspire you to witness it yourself.\n\
  \nI'm lucky not to be tied down to any sort of obligation that prevents me from\
  \ engaging in my gypsy-nomadic lifestyle. The entire world is my home, and for the\
  \ first time in a long time, I finally understood what it means to be free. Free\
  \ to roam the world as often as I wish. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never been to Portugal,\
  \ you have to add this beautiful country to your bucket list. To top it off, the\
  \ Portuguese men are stunning; serving tanned Mediterranean looks with dark features.\
  \ Oh my! \n\nIf you go to Portugal, go to the South. The rock formations are incredible!\
  \ The different layers and colours are vibrant and picture worthy!\nMy mate and\
  \ I took a road trip to Al Garve, where it is known for its stunning beaches. All\
  \ of them as equally as gorgeous with the turquoise water and underground caves,\
  \ which the public has full access to!\n\nMy favourite beach was Praia Don Marinha,\
  \ which has a fantastic view from a cliff that you have to walk down before you\
  \ can enjoy the picturesque water. The caves are easily accessible when the tide\
  \ is low, otherwise, you have to rent a paddle board or take a boat. Plan to go\
  \ with sunscreen and an umbrella as it reached 35 degrees Celsius in  July! \n\n\
  The south has a laid-back cruisy vibe. The nightlife was cosy and I felt safe walking\
  \ around. I noticed a lot of families were out socializing together. It wasn\u2019\
  t just a younger crowd looking to get wasted (unlike the capital Lisboa which is\
  \ a party precinct). Young teens were sharing a bottle of wine with their parents;\
  \ the mix of young and aged people created a strong culture of sophistication which\
  \ was very admirable. \n\nThe villa I stayed at was incredible! It had an extra\
  \ large pool overlooking the lush greenbelt of palm and exotic fruit trees. Lots\
  \ of animals lived on the property, and in particular, I fell in love with a white\
  \ fluffy husky who was extremely overprotective of me when I was near the pool.\
  \ He had a fear complex; every time I went near the water he would bark ballistically!\
  \ It was adorable. \n\nWine in Europe is amazing, and to my surprise, a decent bottle\
  \ was one Euro. Wine is literally cheaper than mineral water!  The capital city\
  \ Lisboa, has exquisite architecture, like most of Europe and its aged culture and\
  \ rich history. The city was a maze of brick and stone towers with eye-catching\
  \ detail in the design. The endless streets and alleys paved in cobblestone, led\
  \ to hidden gems: bars, boutique stores, museums, restaurants and more.\n\n \nI\
  \ could spend hours roaming around the downtown core which was massive! I loved\
  \ the cute Grandmas selling shots of homemade liquor for 1 Euro!  It was safe to\
  \ say that with the inexpensive boozy lifestyle, my inner alcoholic started to surface.\
  \ It became a game, running into the grandmas selling Ginja, and seeing how much\
  \ we could down before the sun started to set. Before we knew it, we were feeling\
  \ the effects of the cherry liquor. Our motor skills started to deteriorate and\
  \ we figured it was best we find some food before we caused chaos! Because we are\
  \ mature adults, that is exactly what we did. \nI am definitely enamoured by Europe\
  \ thus far! The vibe here is something I haven\u2019t felt before. The people, the\
  \ culture and overall experiences have been very special and sophisticated. I cannot\
  \ wait to return to this vibrant country."
