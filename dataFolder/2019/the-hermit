Text: "About ten years ago I was in Bucovina, as part of a film crew of four, doing\
  \ research for a documentary film. Even though it's an old memory now, I still remember\
  \ it vividly because of how I felt back then and how unexpected it all was. \n\n\
  We had heard stories from the locals about a hermit monk living up in the forest.\
  \ People would go to him for advice, solace or in search of spiritual enlightenment.\
  \ The story went, he never took money from people, he would only accept vegetarian\
  \ food. The rumors were intriguing enough for us, so we decided to follow people's\
  \ directions and start climbing the mountain side, through the forest, carrying\
  \ a bag of apples and a loaf of bread as gifts. \n\nIt was not the best day for\
  \ a hike in the woods. It was pretty chilly and it started to rain; the path was\
  \ slippery, muddy and wet. We had no supplies, no proper clothes and no idea how\
  \ far we had to go; someone just said \"follow the path until you get to an opening\
  \ high above, and there you'll see a small hut\u201D. And so we started our ascend.\
  \ The forest was quite thick and dark. We got cold, wet, dirty, hungry. We kept\
  \ looking up to see where the forest ended. There was no end in sight. He might\
  \ have been climbing for a couple of hours. The guys started joking: what is there\
  \ was something creepy about the monk? What if we got lost? What if these were all\
  \ signs we should go back? I laughed, but honestly I could feel a trace of fear\
  \ creeping in. All we had were some stories from the villagers; what if the man\
  \ really was just a crazy, dangerous, wouldn\u2019t-want-to-meet-in-a-forest type\
  \ of person?\n\nBut somehow we pushed forward, fed by curiosity and the feeling\
  \ that we had invested too much time and energy in this pursuit to simply quit halfway.\
  \ And just like that, suddenly, we arrived to a meadow, surrounded by fir trees\
  \ and pines on all sides. We stopped to look around. The rain had ceased. The short\
  \ grass was violently green, the dark clouds were scattering and there was this\
  \ huge, bright rainbow across the sky. I must admit, for a few moments I really\
  \ thought I found something out of this world. And I think my crew felt the same,\
  \ as we were all silent and in awe. We knew even less of what to expect now.\n\n\
  We took a few steps and soon spotted a small hut, guarded by a tall fir tree. We\
  \ looked around, there was nobody outside. We timidly approached and looked through\
  \ the tiny window of the tiny front door and noticed a flickering light inside.\
  \ We stood there for a few minutes, deciding whether we should knock or just wait\
  \ outside, in order not to disturb. We eventually manned up and knocked.\n\nThe\
  \ door opened and this thin, bearded man showed up behind it. He looked at each\
  \ of us and smiled. He seemed much younger than I was expecting and he had the kindest\
  \ eyes and the most generous smiles I had ever seen. He warmly invited us inside,\
  \ with a fatherly voice and a shower of blessings. He couldn't have been much older\
  \ than us. Inside, we found a peaceful world, lit by candles and shy rays coming\
  \ in through the even smaller windows. There were many books, Orthodox icons on\
  \ the wall, a small bed, a table and two chairs. He didn't need more. We spent the\
  \ next hour with him, and we mostly talked about kindness, literature and Biblical\
  \ parables.\n\nIn the end, we left him as we found him, even though we had no idea\
  \ what we were going to find. As for ourselves, we felt differently, though. We\
  \ never got to include him in our documentary because he preferred not to be recorded,\
  \ but we felt much more light-hearted. The way down was easy and peaceful. \n\n\
  I often wondered whether he would still be there, in his tiny hut above the forest,\
  \ welcoming visitors with the same heartwarming composure. I like to believe he\
  \ is."
