Text: "Well to start with, I know for many of you, who are living in India, going\
  \ on a trip to Goa is a not big deal. But for me it was. It was ever first time\
  \ I was going somewhere without my parents and apart from a relatives house and\
  \ it wasn\u2019t about Goa like the place but it was all about going somewhere,\
  \ anywhere I haven\u2019t been before. I was too immature to travel without a parent,\
  \ like a virgin traveller going on an unknown journey. I went on this trip with\
  \ my best friend/ sister from another mister. Honestly, more than excited, we were\
  \ scared because why not,  two girls travelling alone knowing nothing about the\
  \ city, we both were just calculating our if\u2019s and but\u2019s but the drive\
  \ in us to travel somewhere  was much more than any fear we had and that drive,\
  \ that little something we all have in us gave me my life\u2019s most memorable\
  \ amazing lessons. We were so damn excited to explore the city that when we reached\
  \ their we checked into a random hotel and went out of it to just to live our life,\
  \ later realised we forget the way to our hotel and because of damn hell excitement\
  \ and whole lot of emotions we didn\u2019t even read the hotel\u2019s name we checked\
  \ in. We just wanted to get rid of the stuff we were carrying and just wanted to\
  \ see things we\u2019ve heard all our life. Lucky we had some presence of mind,\
  \ we hired a bike from that very hotel that had our stuff and the bike\u2019s keychain\
  \ had a telephone number of hotel and this was something that happened when we just\
  \ stepped into the city. Each day, each night was something that had magic in it.\
  \ Weather it was walking on a beach late night, having a dinner on a cruise, shopping\
  \ and bargaining from a local market of the city, eating local sea food( which was\
  \ yum). I was the happiest and while sharing my experience with you guys, trust\
  \ me I just can\u2019t stop gushing over the time I had there. I remember that one\
  \ night that I want to relive everyday so If you are in Goa and you\u2019ve plans\
  \ to  sleep in hotel before 11 pm, than you\u2019re Goa trip sucks and one night\
  \ that was about to gonna happen with us but lucky us, while we were heading to\
  \ our hotel(luckly we remembered the hotel this time) some group of people out of\
  \ nowhere came in front of our ride and literally begged us to get them in club\
  \ cabbana. Club cabbana in Goa is a paradise for everyone but entry is easy only\
  \ for couples not for stags . We thought why not because any which ways we were\
  \ going back to our hotel had no plans so we thought why not help them but what\
  \ happened next was something we never thought. We went with some strangers. We\
  \ barely even know there names and the next thing I know that me and my friend was\
  \ partying till 5 in the morning with some strangers turned friends we met few hours\
  \ ago. That was the first experience I had with some people I didn\u2019t even know.\
  \ There stories, their experiences, life lessons their was endless thing I learnt\
  \ about human emotions that day. We explored the beauty of city. Collected some\
  \ good stuff as a memory. I remember each and every moment I spent in the city and\
  \ obviously first\u2019s are always special. So always be hungry to explore, to\
  \ meet new people, experiences. Trust me on this I too was very scared to start\
  \ of but once I did I was not able to stop the drive to just explore any\nPlace\
  \ because that\u2019s what makes a life worthwhile."
