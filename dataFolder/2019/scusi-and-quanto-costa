Text: "Scusi! and Quanto costa? \nTwo sentences that taught me what it really felt\
  \ like to be away from home.\n\nPetra \u2013 the name of my German trip mate was\
  \ flowingly written with Chinese brush in green and yellow strokes, which amazingly\
  \ created the same iridescent effect the jewel beetle\u2019s wing boasted. Apart\
  \ from such vibrant shades, the proper name with rock-hard connotation was also\
  \ animated with lively little birds perching around the edge of those 5 letters.\
  \ That piece of improvised art was crafted by a street calligrapher whose foldable\
  \ studio was found a few steps away from Piazza di Santa Maria Novella. \n\nHappiness,\
  \ satisfaction, enjoyment, I wasn\u2019t sure which one but it definitely was the\
  \ very positive emotion that was shining across Petra\u2019s face when we walked\
  \ away with her exquisitely calligraphed name. My facial expression should radiate\
  \ the same feeling because ambling along the cobbled streets of Florence that night\
  \ was like nibbling your favorite Nutella gelato and surprisingly found pistachios\
  \ inside. We got a chance to appreciate the double artistic delights: the iconic\
  \ Renaissance basilicas and buildings alongside the street art festival this Tuscany\u2019\
  s beloved city was hosting. I could tell though that my face looked pretty much\
  \ like a Fiorentina fan after a losing game thanks to those two communication incidents.\n\
  \n\u201CScusi!\u201D I chose to approach a middle-age Signora who wasn\u2019t awestruck\
  \ by the architectural eye candies around us like the tourists. This one, she was\
  \ nonchalantly walking along Piazza del Duomo like passing through the dried pasta\
  \ aisle in supermarket. She must be a Florentine \u2013 the perfect person to ask\
  \ for the direction to our hotel on Via del Trebbio, I assumed. Unexpectedly, she\
  \ raised her palm to my face, refusing to have even a single word with me, and strode\
  \ away with her chin up. No, \u201CScusi\u201D didn\u2019t mean \u201CYou look fat\
  \ in that blouse!\u201D then or now. It\u2019s simply the polite form of \u201C\
  Excuse me\u201D in Italian. Well, she didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry to go somewhere;\
  \ maybe she had to save her soprano voice for the concert. I tried to convince myself\
  \ for a peace of mind as the soothing sight of the Duomo at night couldn\u2019t\
  \ help me much.\n\nOn our way to the hotel, we walked across the festival and decided\
  \ to let our eyes and ears guide us instead of the map. All of the sudden, Petra\
  \ stopped us to stare at the stunning brushstrokes of the calligrapher, who was\
  \ offering to breathed art into our names or messages.\n\n\u201CQuanto costa?\u201D\
  \ I asked for the price of her skillful service as Petra\u2019s enthusiasm could\
  \ be seen from Rome. She used her soft and humble voice to reply, and used her gaze\
  \ to communicate more with me. Through her East Asian almond eyes, I could sense\
  \ her forlorn questions: \u201CAre you from my neck of the woods? Has this country\
  \ treated you well?\u201D My Chinese-Thai eyes could only show her my admiration\
  \ and moral support. Our telepathic conversation didn\u2019t last long as she had\
  \ names to write.\n\nThose short exchanging of feelings gave me a dose of melancholy.\
  \ Somehow, they also made me miss being a first-class citizen at home where I always\
  \ felt belonged and warmly welcomed. Anyway, I managed to shake them off. I didn\u2019\
  t fly this far to feel blue; I got a lot of Carpe Diem to do, capturing Florentine\
  \ experiences in my mind and camera.\n\nEarly next morning, while heading back towards\
  \ Piazza di Santa Maria Novella to go to the train station for Pisa, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but looked around, trying to save all this capital of aesthetic could offer\
  \ into my memory. Then I spotted her! Crouching over her DIY studio, obviously the\
  \ calligrapher was the only one spending a night at that enchanting square while\
  \ other artists went back to their cozy beds.\n\nI didn\u2019t know if the concept\
  \ of renaissance attracted her to this city, but I hoped it lent her the power of\
  \ rebirth to gracefully rise from this unhealthy fate like a Phoenix and fly back\
  \ to her home with success and pride."
