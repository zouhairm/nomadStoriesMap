Text: "When I decided to visit Auli, little did I expect to find a mini Switzerland\
  \ in my very own India. My desire to get there was driven by nothing more than a\
  \ few pretty pictures on the internet. But this quaint little village nestled in\
  \ the middle of gigantic rugged mountains has stolen a part of me, and rightly so.\n\
  \nThis was one of those go-with-the-flow kind of a trips where my partner and I\
  \ had nothing nothing but a bus ticket from Delhi to Rishikesh and the dream to\
  \ lie down on the ski slopes of Auli and stargaze. But the tiring journey showed\
  \ us how unplanned trips and local connections lead you to places that no plan can.\
  \ Getting there included a 6-hr bus ride to Rishikesh, followed by a 12-hr local\
  \ bus to Joshimath and a 20-min ropeway ride to the paradise called Auli. As we\
  \ crossed each tower on the ropeway, all we could see were miles of green meadows\
  \ with millions of grazing sheep. All of it under our feet. And when I looked up,\
  \ the horizon displayed snow-clad mountains all the way, and in all directions.\
  \ This is the first time in the last day when we felt that we're finally nearing\
  \ our paradise. \n\nAs we stepped off the ropeway, the view did no justice to my\
  \ imagination or the images on the internet that led me here. Imagine miles and\
  \ miles of green pastures with cute little huts distanced sparingly, a crowd of\
  \ snow clad mountains, with the Nanda Devi peak towering above them all and shining\
  \ gold and proud. As my eyes scanned left to right, I noticed a huge blue lake with\
  \ crystal-clear water and a necklace of ice around it. All we could do at the moment\
  \ was to stop and stare. Our fatigue and tire from the last day was instantly stolen\
  \ by a single breath of the fresh air. It was time to start this beautiful journey.\
  \ \n\nAuli is known to be a skiing destination for the adventurers and a stopover\
  \ destination for people heading to the Kedarnath pilgrimage. But surprisingly doesn\u2019\
  t buzz with tourists owing to its distance and difficult terrains. To get to our\
  \ cottages, we took a cable chair car downhill, happily dangling our feet 2500m\
  \ above sea level. Our tiny standalone wooden cottage opened up to a spectacular\
  \ view of 180-degree mountain range and a colourful garden with flowers I hadn\u2019\
  t seen before. Every room in the property is an individual cottage making it a perfect\
  \ getaway for couples. \n\nAs the sun went down, every evening reverbed with the\
  \ distant sound of the holy mantras from the hill-top temple. Our first evening\
  \ was spent taking in the sight of the golden mountains slowly turning white and\
  \ then silver along with the silent sounds of this place. \n\nThe next day was all\
  \ about explorations and nature hikes. We set off early in the morning to get a\
  \ glimpse of the sunrise from the nearby Hanuman temple, where the view of Nanda\
  \ Devi peak is at its best. Illuminated against the morning sun, it looks like a\
  \ symmetrically sculpted mountain. The temple speaks of its history with scriptures,\
  \ images and its architecture. The rest of the day was all about finding snow. We\
  \ walked across the pastures to the top of the hill where we found the lake. To\
  \ our surprise, we found that the lake was originally meant to be a reservoir for\
  \ artificial snow to support skiing in the off seasons as well. But unfortunately,\
  \ due to global warming and rising temperatures every year, this reservoir has now\
  \ transformed into an artificial lake. We walked past the lake into the hills to\
  \ spot of snow we could see. On the way, we encountered numerous herds of sheep\
  \ and even a little bit of snowfall, which dramatically changed the view instantly.\
  \ \n\nWhile the skies turned an angry grey, we walked back to our room for the night\
  \ and the raindrops hit against our jackets to turn to icicles. As the day came\
  \ to an end we lay on the ground to explore all the stars in the Milky Way."
