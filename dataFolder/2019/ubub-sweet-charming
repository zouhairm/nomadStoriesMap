Text: "Deep in the center of the mountains of Bali Island (Indonesia), among the forests\
  \ and lush rice fields are a small town that is said to be the spiritual and cultural\
  \ heart of this island: Ubud.\nIn Ubud, people have a belief that gods exist in\
  \ elements of nature. Therefore, in the conception of indigenous people, the spiritual\
  \ world and the human world continually interact with each other. We will see the\
  \ thanksgiving ceremony placed all along the way. In the town there were always\
  \ women sitting on the steps, smiling and knit palm leaves into flower-filled sari\
  \ baskets to give to the temple. It can be said, the evaluation of the virtue of\
  \ women in Bali is based on the fact that the offerings are good and the house is\
  \ fragrant or not. The temple is everywhere. At the crossroads, the intersection\
  \ has a statue of a god wearing sarongs. \nBali in general, or Ubud in particular,\
  \ is always floating in the smell of agarwood and sweet-smelling flowers - spiritual\
  \ offerings - which are jasmine, jade and countless unknown name flowers. It is\
  \ a kind of ritual smell of spirituality. Frangipani flower becomes a symbol in\
  \ this land. Early in the morning, I went around Ubud market, saw the girls dressed\
  \ seriously, hand holding frangipani flower to sprinkle water. The offerings in\
  \ this island have no food, only five types of five-color flowers and a tangled\
  \ grass in banana leaves. The offerings to the gods were put in caskets woven with\
  \ palm leaves, coconut leaves, women put on their heads, carried on their shoulders\
  \ to the temple. The offerings to the gods are placed in theplace of worship hanging\
  \ on the tree stems. The offerings of gods and evil spirits in the plates of coconut\
  \ leaves are placed at the entrance to the house or the bushes. Presenting good\
  \ gods to pray for blessing, also with evil spirits to avoid disaster. \nThe innkeeper\
  \ told us that another interesting thing about Ubud is that the place is quite full\
  \ of international products. If you miss certain foods from another country, we\
  \ can easily find them here like Japan, Mexico, Italy, Middle East... When Ubud\
  \ awakens on the new day, it is also a good time to go to the market, although the\
  \ stalls are a bit late. Ubud Market is divided into 2 areas, a staple food area\
  \ for local people and a shopping area for visitors. The art items spilled from\
  \ the market to the alley makes visitors seem to be lost in the fairy land between\
  \ quiet space. You can find Batik cloth shops, many kinds of material dreamcatcher,\
  \ shops selling the most bizarre chairs in the world or hundreds of delicate wooden\
  \ animals such as giraffes and owls\u2026\nWhenever visitors buy anything, no matter\
  \ how much money, the owner of the shop spreads out the notes and waved them quickly\
  \ on the sold-out counter, which they say is to have good bussiness next time."
