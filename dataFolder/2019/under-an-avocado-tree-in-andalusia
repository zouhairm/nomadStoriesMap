Text: "Sheltered from the imposing heat of an Andalusian afternoon, we gathered around\
  \ the tasting table, beneath the canopy of an impressive avocado tree.  A spread\
  \ of delicious Spanish tapas \u2014 figs, jamon, crumbly pastries, crusts of bread,\
  \ and local cheese \u2014  was set before us.  The conversation slipped from Spanish\
  \ to English to something in between, a jovial attempt at communication in which\
  \ no party had the upper hand, but laughter and free-flowing wine made friends of\
  \ us all.  Looking around the table, at companions old and new, as they drank and\
  \ ate, talked and smiled, I felt a sense of calm and contentment settle in.  Maybe\
  \ it was the heat and the wine, maybe it was the often alluded to \u2018magic of\
  \ Spain\u2019, but under this tree at a winery just outside of Ronda, I felt at\
  \ home.\n  Known for their relaxed, good-natured enjoyment of life, the people of\
  \ Andalusia were wonderful hosts \u2014 interested in sharing their happiness and\
  \ showing off the beauty of their land.  From the moment I stepped off the train\
  \ at the station in Ronda, I knew I was in a special place.  During the short car\
  \ ride from the station, I looked out over the rolling fields of the valley, an\
  \ enchanting landscape quilted with grapevines and olive trees.  Our destination,\
  \ Bodega Descalzos Viejos, is a beautiful historic monastery turned winery.  From\
  \ the original chapel featuring hand-painted frescoes of Andalusian saints (which\
  \ now holds vats and barrels of their delicious wine) to the gardens filled with\
  \ fountains, low rock walls, and ancestral fruit trees, there are captivating sights\
  \ around every corner.  On a hill with a breathtaking view of the surrounding vineyards,\
  \ Descalzos Viejos seems an ideal spot for a winery.  A tour of the property from\
  \ our host and one of the owners, Flavio Salesi, was full of good humor and historic\
  \ details about the structure\u2019s origin as a 16th-century monastery.  Originally\
  \ an architect, Flavio, and his business partner purchased the crumbling structure\
  \ and surrounding property in the late 90\u2019s and have turned it into an icon\
  \ of the area\u2019s wine scene.  Hosting conferences, events, and concerts, this\
  \ bodega has become a cultural center for the region.\n  I visited Descalzos Viejos\
  \ while collaborating on a project with Two Birds One Stone, a Spanish eco-tourism\
  \ company, and The Cork Forest Conservation Alliance, with the goal to experience\
  \ the place and capture our time there in photographs.  Our group was a jovial bunch\
  \ \u2014 lovers of Spain both Spanish and American in origin, interested in the\
  \ history and beauty of the place, but most importantly, the wine.  As we sampled\
  \ their offerings, our host Flavio became preoccupied with the Google GLASS my husband\
  \ was sporting and beta-testing at the time.  The offer was made for him to try\
  \ them, but Flavio demurred and went back to pouring wine, laughing and speaking\
  \ of the trials of technology when raising two teenage daughters.  When our group\
  \ finished yet another bottle, Flavio excused himself to the main building, returning\
  \ a few minutes later with a wine cork banded to the side of his sunglasses in a\
  \ light-hearted caricature of the GLASS.  Flavio unselfconsciously wore his glasses\
  \ that way for some time, eliciting fresh bouts of giggling with every turn of his\
  \ head.\n  Several hours and bottles later, with only crumbs remaining on the tapas\
  \ plates, I excused myself from the tasting room under the tree and wandered a bit\
  \ to get a fuller sense of the location.  Cozying up to one of the free-ranging\
  \ dogs of the property (there are always dogs in Spain and I always found them right\
  \ away), I sat beside an ancient stone wall, carpeted with vines perhaps planted\
  \ centuries ago, and looked out over a magical landscape.  Though the heat was immense,\
  \ the light was perfect, and the breeze refreshing.  The unnamed pup and I sat that\
  \ way for a while, taking in the iconic view as I lazily scratched him behind the\
  \ ear. I had already been in Spain for over a week, but after a few blissful, laughter-filled\
  \ hours beneath an avocado tree on a tall hillside, I fully fell in love with the\
  \ magic of the place.  For me, it was perfection."
