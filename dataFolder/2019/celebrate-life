Text: 5 years ago my journey began, I was not really expecting to have a second life
  as I spend the last 6 months in the hospital. During my darkest days, I have realized
  that i need to make the most of my life every day because we live once, My mind
  was like a bullet train trying to reminisce my life for the past 26 uears of my
  existence and I am asking myself if I was able to live my life the way I wanted
  to. Now I am already 31 years old and I started travelling abroad, The first country
  that I was able to visit is Thailand, Ot was an amazing experience to mingle and
  encounter a different culture, I have realized that theres more to life that I currently
  had backbin the Philippines, I believe that I deserve a shot to be selected on this
  trave experience because I would like to be a role model and I want to bring the
  legacy to my fellow countrymen that it is not too late to explore and expand your
  horizon, Age is just a number and in life, there is more to see than can never be
  see and there is more to do than can never be done. Thank you
