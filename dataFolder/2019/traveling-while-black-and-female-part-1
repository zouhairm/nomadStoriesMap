Text: "No easy way to speak of this matter. \n\nYou can only speak of your own experiences.\
  \ I do believe one hundred percent that you attract what to give out. The difference\
  \ here is when it come to matter of race it doesn\u2019t even matter some or most\
  \ of the time. \n\nAdd the element of traveling to it. (When I mean \u201Cit\u201D\
  , I mean into one\u2019s life.) When you are a female and you travel solo there\u2019\
  s always that concern for your safety. Not like bad things happen. However things\
  \ happen. Obviously, Right? \n\nWhen I first started traveling I traveled with people\
  \ and within the US. You definitely had a level of \u201CI am an American\u201D\
  \ What can happen. Well The news tells you even in your own neighborhood anything\
  \ can. \n\n In Iceland my trip was so short I didn\u2019t even feel I could discuss\
  \ it. We were absolutely snowed in due to a blizzard. But I think its worth it to\
  \ talk about I did get to interact with my Airbnb Host a native Icelandic man, he\
  \ told me his life as a 38 year old man that never left. He was honest for what\
  \ I could tel and just so eager. I was actually very drawn to his story and his\
  \ way of life. He seemed very into American culture and was beyond friendly to me.\
  \ Made me breakfast and gave me free wine. It almost felt like he didn\u2019t see\
  \ my race. I was just An American and he was just an Icelandic person.  I will add-I\
  \ really need to try Iceland one more time before deciphering who they really are.\
  \ \n\nFrance, last year was like a drug to me. I guess it would be the reasons why\
  \ I went twice in under 12 months. The people were so phenomenal but I must confess\
  \ something, growing up with foreign parents -French Dad. I cheated. I understand\
  \ the French. Its very odd to explain but you inherit the mannerisms through the\
  \ language. Differences I never felt  being black or female or solo was an issue.\
  \ If I felt any \u201Cwall\u201D, maybe hesitation or any indifference was the feeling\
  \ of being not a native French, or Classy, or the effortless intelligence of  being\
  \ French. Everyone is super smart and worldly  and funny. So I think I made myself\
  \ stand out by not catching the jokes faster. That in itself made for great learning\
  \ experience.\n\nAs BLACK: I know the issues with Paris is more a Class issue. Not\
  \ Race. Not Black. There was the Female Superiority difference. Women in Paris are\
  \ naturally the most beautiful women I have ever seen. They Know it. If not for\
  \ their stunning looks its their phenomenal PERSONALITY.\n\nAs a WOMAN: I know now\
  \ and had to learn that women do not compliment one another. If you are a confident\
  \ woman complimenting another  woman looks suspicious. I had many conversations\
  \ of why? and I got the same answer \u201Cthat\u2019s just Paris, people are use\
  \ to everyone wanting something from you especially when they are nice for \u201C\
  no reason\u201D\u201D! \n\nRelationships- Well Well Well. I will admit fell in love\
  \ sometime back with who is now a friend of mine. I learned a lot about french men.\
  \ I will just say french men are wonderful to fall for and great lovers, just don\u2019\
  t stay in love. \n\nI can see me spending my later life in Paris. I hope sooner\
  \ than later, I can take my daughter. I would love the experience for both my kids.\n\
  \n Italy\u2013 During the summer I went to many different parts. I found myself\
  \ immediately understanding something. The act of social awareness, let me explain:\
  \ As a teen i noticed people do this thing when try purposefully try to \u201CNOT\u201D\
  \ acknowledge you, they look away from you. It's a form of Social Awareness. I know\
  \ my place and you know yours. I never felt that but was it brought to my attention\
  \ by my travel buddies. There\u2019s a few immigration issues that are slowly effecting\
  \ Italy right now and they believe it is a away to show respectfully you are not\
  \ \u201CItalian\u201D so please watch how you address me.\n\nTo be continued."
