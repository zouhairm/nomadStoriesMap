Text: "I have always lived in a small town in the countryside of Brazil. My family\
  \ comes even from a smaller town where the cultivation of cocoa was the main way\
  \ to survive. I never imagined myself in a diferente place. I have always been passionate\
  \ about new cultures and have always done a lot of research in books and the internet.\
  \ So, when I finished high school I had the opportunity to attend a university.\
  \ Even though I was at university I never thought that one day I would be able to\
  \ leave the country and have contact with another culture until that day arrived.\
  \ I went to South Africa. All things I saw there were inexplicable. I lived things\
  \ and saw things that I thought I could never do. I was able to experience so much\
  \ of a new culture that I was ecstatic.I lived many adventures in Cape Town, made\
  \ several friendships which is new to me also because I have always been a person\
  \ with few friends. The adventure began before I got there, I had never been on\
  \ a plane before and on my first time I took 12 hours in the flght to the other\
  \ side of the ocean and I went alone. I do not know where I got the strength and\
  \ psychological for such an adventure. I ate things I had never eaten in my life,\
  \ a simple trip to the market made me learn new things, make new friends and get\
  \ in touch with new environments. In front of this, there was also my surprise to\
  \ find so many Brazilians in that place. \nDespite this, I made friends with Italians,\
  \ Arabs, Mozambicans, Portuguese, Chileans, Spanish, Japanese, South Africans...\
  \ every shared experience there took me to travel to each country they came from.\
  \ \nWell, the most unforgettable day there (and in my whole life) was the day we\
  \ climbed Table Moutain, the most famous mountain in South Africa. At first, since\
  \ I have asthma, I thought I could not climb but I got to the top (considering few\
  \ hours late) and I was able to glimpse the best view of all time. The sunset was\
  \ the most beautiful thing my eyes even see in this world. \nSome things made this\
  \ moment even more special. First there was a person playing bagpipes in the highest\
  \ place and listening to that song with the view of the sea and the sunrise was\
  \ spectacular. Second thing is that the initial scenes from one of my favorite movies\
  \ were recorded in that exact place (Resident Evil). I have lived many other experiences\
  \ that are impossible to summarize in a single text, I would need days, months or\
  \ even years to explain what I felt those moments."
