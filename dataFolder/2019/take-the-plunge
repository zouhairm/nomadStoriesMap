Text: "Growing up in a small, North Yorkshire town was all I had known. Tea rooms,\
  \ ornate hotels and meadows of flowers were my knowledge of the world and nothing\
  \ outside; a sealed bubble of predominantly white, working class life.  \n\nAfter\
  \ returning home from university the veil had been partially lifted from the life\
  \ I had known and I was raring to escape but not sure how. Through seeing the exploits\
  \ of my friend teaching English in China on social media she introduced me to her\
  \ boss but fear took hold of me. I was going to call back and explain I wasn\u2019\
  t ready but as my hand hovered over the phone I steadied myself and didn\u2019t\
  \ dial.  \n\nOne Skype interview, a 25kg bag and a dose of adrenaline fuelled anxiety\
  \ later I was boarding a flight to my new life as an English teacher in the city\
  \ of Chongqing, China. I\u2019d left my family, my friends and most of all the love\
  \ of my life but I knew it was a journey worth taking. We would be apart for ten\
  \ months and that time would test our relationship to its limits.  \n\nTravelling\
  \ from a quaint, Yorkshire town with a population of around 150,000 to a concrete\
  \ metropolis of over 30 million people would be enough to put anyone on edge. Beeping,\
  \ shouting, banging, screeching, it was an assault on the senses that left me dizzy\
  \ in my first couple of months. My first impressions left me crying and frustrated,\
  \ thinking I\u2019d made a terrible mistake. I felt ripped from my body, unable\
  \ to talk the language, goggled at, pointed, prodded and pestered by the locals\
  \ as if I were a prize in a cage.  \n\nOnly once I\u2019d met fellow expats did\
  \ I realise I wasn\u2019t alone and everyone was in the same boat. Although we were\
  \ total strangers at first we shared our own experiences which made us bond instantly\
  \ as only travellers will. From hearing everyone\u2019s stories I realised in that\
  \ moment to take the plunge and embrace all facets of the city from its fiery food,\
  \ studying Mandarin and absorbing the culture like a sponge.\n\nAs the months peeled\
  \ away I was nearing the end of my journey. My birthday was approaching and I decided\
  \ to go on one final trip to the mountainous region of Zhangjiajie national forest\
  \ park or \u2018The Avatar Mountains\u2019 as they\u2019re more commonly known.\
  \ I never thought I\u2019d have the confidence to go by myself on a three day hike\
  \ through a prehistoric looking landscape but I couldn\u2019t wait to get going.\
  \ \n\nOn the final day of hiking there was a low, hanging fog that coiled itself\
  \ around the jagged rocks and the sun broke through the clouds as I reached the\
  \ apex. The chattering locals were taking endless pictures, all crammed together\
  \ on the viewing platform but I found a hidden vantage point off the tourist trail\
  \ and rested as I took in the spectacular views down below. I thought about everything\
  \ I\u2019d done during my time in China and by no longer allowing myself to be governed\
  \ by fear I had to smile on all I\u2019d achieved. \n\nMy journey was over, my flight\
  \ ready to board. I returned to my home town and the veil had been fully lifted\
  \ from my eyes because I no longer recognised the place I once lived. It was a stranger\
  \ to me, claustrophobic and uninviting. I had to set out on my own and have the\
  \ courage to make the impossible choice. \n\nI didn\u2019t know it at the time but\
  \ my journey to China would set off a chain of events that would take me to a new\
  \ home, to new adventures and away from those I cared for and especially from the\
  \ one I loved more than life itself."
