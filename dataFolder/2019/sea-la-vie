Text: "Travel. \nFor me, travel has become the centre of my life. What can I say?\
  \ I\u2019m hooked! \nSo how did I get here?\n\nI was a hard-working A-Level student\
  \ on for good grades across the board, I had a conditional offer from the one university\
  \ I had applied to in the Netherlands and was expected to get the place; so much\
  \ so, accommodation had been set up, flights booked and preparation for the semester\
  \ had begun. Until results day. Plan B. After a few weeks of research, I found myself\
  \ getting more and more interested in the many marine conservation programmes worldwide\
  \ and was soon registering and booking flights to Mauritius with Lagon Bleu. \n\n\
  Lagon Bleu is based on the South-East Coast of Mauritius Island in Blue Bay. A palm\
  \ fringed coastal town with crystal clear, ice blue waters encircling its shores\
  \ and giving Blue Bay its name. A highly distinctive and important network of coral\
  \ reefs protecting this part of the island from the ocean waves shelters jewelled\
  \ pendant islet, \xCEle des Deux Coco. Here, the main traffic is the procession\
  \ of fish between coral and the gentle ocean breeze skims the azure waters. A mere\
  \ ten-minute drive away lies the typically tranquil town of Mah\xE9bourg, bustling\
  \ with locals at its famous markets on a Monday morning; the sensational nature\
  \ reserve islet \xCEle aux Aigrettes, home to many rare species of plants and animals\
  \ such as the oldest Aldabra Giant Tortoise, Big Daddy; and awe-inspiring Lion Mountain,\
  \ which dominates the region with its grandeur. This paradisiacal island was to\
  \ be my home for the next four weeks. \n\nLagon Bleu focuses on three marine conservation\
  \ projects one of which is sea turtle monitoring. I was really looking forward to\
  \ getting stuck into the programme and I could not wait to snorkel in the aquamarine\
  \ lagoon. I was told, because sea turtles tend to be elusive that this makes them\
  \ quite hard to come by, particularly the Green turtles, meaning my best bet would\
  \ be seeing a Hawksbill turtle. Nevertheless, I was still hopeful to see one, even\
  \ if it was just a glimpse. \n\nNo day was the same and having become used to snorkelling\
  \ so much, I had completely fallen in love with this watery world, making the daily\
  \ wetsuit struggle and the boiling hot walk down to the beach all the worthwhile.\
  \ Utterly transfixed, I watched schools of fish part around me in an array of colour\
  \ like a scene from Finding Nemo, until I came across one particularly stubborn\
  \ species of fish. He moves for no fish, let alone a mere human. A feisty little\
  \ fella all of 14cm, grey in colour and known as the Dusky Farmer fish. Among the\
  \ hundreds, one of the most outstanding species for me was the Racoon Butterflyfish,\
  \ rightly named for its \u2018masked\u2019 face and typically nocturnal nature.\
  \ The black eye bar, backed by a strong white band, creates the mask whilst its\
  \ scales are graduated tones of caramel gold, tawny brown and mahogany (sounds like\
  \ I am describing the best chocolate biscuit in the world, I promise you this is\
  \ a real fish). Seeing such an exquisite creature out of its nocturnal habit made\
  \ me want to follow it, and follow it I did. Mesmerised by this enchanting butterflyfish\
  \ and the strangely comforting weight of the ocean on my shoulders, I almost forgot\
  \ to come up for air! Having surfaced, I was met with excited shouts from the girls.\
  \ \u2018TURTLE!\u2019\n\nI kicked hard, letting my flippers propel me through the\
  \ water. I could feel the lactic acid burning in my arms as I pulled myself over\
  \ the coral. Four sets of flippers came into view and I slowed my pace. Aza met\
  \ my gaze and pointed downwards. There, I saw the classic amber, mottled brown shell\
  \ of a Hawksbill sea turtle peacefully gliding by. I began to smile and my snorkel\
  \ filled up with water. Staying one metre away, I swam with this wondrous reptile.\
  \ \nPure joy. It had made what was already a fantastic trip, perfect. \n\nAs my\
  \ fortune cookie previously said, \u2018all glory comes from daring to begin.\u2019"
