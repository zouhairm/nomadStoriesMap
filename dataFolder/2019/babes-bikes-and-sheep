Text: "There are several things that get me excited about travelling, and the more\
  \ boxes that can be ticked, the better: warm days, blue skies, beautiful vistas,\
  \ and good roads to ride my motorbike.  I don't have many female friends that share\
  \ my passion for wearing a set of leathers and winding the throttle on, so I normally\
  \ travel with my husband. So, when the opportunity to camp in a field, in Wales,\
  \ with a group of women came up I was naturally very excited! \n\nWales isn't far\
  \ away for me, but I wanted the travel to and from the site to be as exciting as\
  \ my time there. I was envious of those that would be riding up from the south coast,\
  \ and even more envious of those travelling from Scotland. How could I possibly\
  \ make a journey from the Midlands to Wales exciting when it's a little over 100\
  \ miles away and only 1 motorway away? It dawned on me that life on a motorway is\
  \ boring. Unless you need to get from A to B as quickly as possible, there are far\
  \ more interesting routes to take, as long as you don't mind taking smaller roads\
  \ or adding a bit longer to your journey. \n\nThe day of my ride made me more excited\
  \ than a 7-year-old on their birthday. I loaded up my bike with the essentials and\
  \ waved goodbye to my husband. I was too pumped up about what I was about to do\
  \ to feel teary about leaving him. I didn't know exactly what to expect when I arrived\
  \ at the campsite but I knew I was going to make the most of the journey there.\
  \ On the familiar roads close to home, I felt really sure of where I was and what\
  \ I was doing, making confident decisions about the turns I needed to take.  30\
  \ miles away from home I was already less familiar with my route and I started to\
  \ question why I had decided to make the journey without a sat nav and why I hadn't\
  \ done a practice run. I figured you don't get any rehearsals in life, so why would\
  \ I test out the journey ahead of time?  As I snaked along the A454 towards Bridgnorth\
  \ the hedgerows and fields seemed to stretch for as far as my eyes could see, and\
  \ the lack of dual carriageways made me feel a million miles away from home. I relaxed\
  \ as I smelled the fresh air and beamed a big smile. \n\nAs I approached a roundabout\
  \ I saw the signs for the A49 and I knew from here-on I was in uncharted territory,\
  \ for me at least. It was my first marker for the next town to ride through and\
  \ headed towards Ludlow. It was just beyond Leominster I saw a couple of bikes,\
  \ laden with luggage and I felt a surge of euphoria flood my body, I just knew they\
  \ were women riding to the same place as me, I could feel it. I gave them a wave\
  \ as I got close enough and they waved back; it was the universal signal that we\
  \ were strangers riding together as friends. \n\nThe remaining few clouds in the\
  \ sky dispersed as the sun caused me to put my sun visor down and I saw the brown\
  \ sign I'd been waiting for - Croeso i Gymru - I was in Wales! From that point on\
  \ the roads got narrower, our small group of riders picked up more lone riders,\
  \ and the hills rolled in, as I crested each rise I felt like I was on top of a\
  \ mountain. We were riding as a small pack as we saw the signs for Treharris, our\
  \ final destination and someone behind me sounded their horn in celebration then\
  \ others joined in. \n\nPulling into the driveway there was a barn to the left with\
  \ at least twenty women cheering to celebrate our arrival. I felt like a rockstar\
  \ when before I could get my helmet off I was being hugged and high fived. I didn't\
  \ expect to make friends on my journey, but I found a new family that weekend."
