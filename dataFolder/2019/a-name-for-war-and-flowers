Text: "First words to my girlfriend were: do you know there\u2019s a city with your\
  \ last name? Couple of years later, while cracking an enigmatic luggage locker in\
  \ cyrillic at Kiev central station we realized that we were about to honour that\
  \ first chat. We already knew Chornobai was a town of five thousand with just one\
  \ main street. But weeks before we discovered that her family, the one that gave\
  \ her the name, didn\u2019t originated in Chornobai. This meant we now were in a\
  \ quest for a name and nothing else.\n\nIn the afternoon we got a first class ticket\
  \ for the sleeper train. Hours before we gave up travelling the same route in a\
  \ van with a cracked windshield and no seatbelts, so we were in great mood. We got\
  \ off in Cherkassy to spend the night before getting the bus to Chornobai the morning\
  \ after. It was a great afternoon, sunset gleaming on the dome of the orthodox church.\
  \ For some reason our hotel booking was not honoured and we ended up sleeping in\
  \ a soviet style inn in the outskirts of Cherkasy, among truck dealerships and small\
  \ industries. But we were so close to Chornobai that it wasn\u2019t a problem at\
  \ all. Early in the next morning we got on a small bus with flags hanging above\
  \ the panel, worn upholstery, and gear changes that were always followed by a loud\
  \ noise. \n\nAfter about an hour of roads both good and bumpy, we arrived in Chornobai\
  \ without a clue of what to do next. We saw an austere looking square. Getting closer\
  \ we discovered a memorial for a sunk submarine crew. There was also an obelisk\
  \ overlooking the nearby river. Albeit being a war memorial, everything was calm\
  \ and since it was springtime, flowers were all over the place.\n\nWe head back\
  \ to Leninska, the main street. Guessing which among those peculiar shop windows\
  \ was a restaurant was though, so we stood with our first find: aa pizza in a bar\
  \ packed with army officers. We took a napkin as a souvenir: it decorated with a\
  \ pattern of flowers in it, resembling embroidery. Before leaving my girlfriend\
  \ excitingly showed the guy at the bar her ID. He read it, pointed to the ground,\
  \ said \u201CChornobai!\u201D and nothing else. \nOur first attempt to connect with\
  \ that territory was pretty dull.\n\nAfter walking a few more blocks - which accounts\
  \ for pretty much half the town, we found sort of a cultural center and asked the\
  \ employees if there was any museum around. Happily, there was and Oksana, the guide,\
  \ arrived. In English, for our delight, she showed a single room depicting the region's\
  \ fauna, flora, clothing and history, told mainly through books and war medals.\
  \ Hidden in a storeroom we saw a marble Lenin statue, which she constrainedly told\
  \ us was previously displayed in the town square. She then changed the subject to\
  \ herself. From war in Azerbaijan and consequent immigration to the present day\
  \ tranquility of that museum, she told us her life story in such a natural and kind\
  \ way that it was touching. Before we left, maybe to soften up the conversation,\
  \ Oksana complimented my girlfriend\u2019s earrings: they were painted with flowers\
  \ and bought in Kiev the day before.\n\nThe experience on the museum and talking\
  \ to Oksana was exactly the kind of small town sincerity we were unknowingly looking\
  \ for. After about six hours there we jumped back on another old bus, passed a decorative\
  \ cannon in the entrance of the city and left Chornobai. We had a weird but pleasant\
  \ feeling of accomplishment. And the certainty that, for the good and for the bad,\
  \ Ukraine is about war and flowers."
