Text: "I had five hours to locate my passport before the next flight to Paris to attend\
  \ my friend's PACs ceremony. It disappeared at some point during my layover in Lisbon.\
  \ It became apparent only when I walked up to the border check point agent to get\
  \ the stamp to pass into the Schengen zone. Searching frantically through my pockets\
  \ and small suitcase (always travel light), I looked pathetically into the blas\xE9\
  \ eyes of the agent, who gestured for an airport attendant.\n\n\"Can you step aside\
  \ please?\" instructed the attendant in heavily accented English. He was a handsome\
  \ yet gentle spirit and seemed genuinely concerned when I said, \"I can't find my\
  \ passport!\"  \n\n\"Do you remember when you had it last?\" he asked.\n\n\"I know\
  \ I had it on the plane because I had --\" and just like that I realized that I\
  \ left it in the back pocket of the seat in front of me. I told the attendant, who\
  \ walked me over to his desk to make a phone call to the airline. They did not have\
  \ a US passport. He explained that the flight attendants clean the plane immediately\
  \ after disembarkment and give any lost property to the airline's department. He\
  \ said I would have to go to Immigration to figure out an alternative solution.\n\
  \nNow, I am from New York City where everything is bustling at a rapid pace. So\
  \ when I say that the Portuguese immigration office was moving on a completely different\
  \ timeline, I do not speak hyperbole. They informed me that I would have to call\
  \ the embassy and see if I could get an expedited passport. The wait time: three\
  \ hours. I grabbed a ticket and instead of sitting around twiddling my thumbs, I\
  \ ran to the nearest airport phone. \n\nI called the airline again, \"Do you have\
  \ my passport?\"\n\n\"Eu \xF1ao entendo,\" she replied. If my high school Spanish,\
  \ college Latin, and self-taught French were worth anything, it was in this moment.\n\
  \n\"Mi passeporte. Il est perdu. Tu la habes ?\" I asked frantically. \n\n\"\xBF\
  Que?\" she replied.\n\n\"Vous parlez Espanol ? Fran\xE7ais ?\"I asked.\n\nShe responded,\
  \ \"\xA1Ah, si si! Passaporte. \xBFPerdido?\" \n\n\"Si! Tu la habes?\" I repeated.\n\
  \n\"No,\" she sighed and continued to speaking in Portuguese.\n\nHaving no idea\
  \ what she said, I responded, \"Obrigado,\" and hung up the phone.\n\nThe next few\
  \ hours involved running around the airport searching the ground, calling the airline\
  \ again to see if I could search the plane, finding out that the plane I was turning\
  \ back to NYC, trying to get to the gate it was in after asking the airport attendant\
  \ for information, being told that I needed a ticket to get through to the gate,\
  \ smoking three packs of cigarettes, calling the embassy at the immigration office\
  \ to no avail, and then being told that I would have to wait in the office to be\
  \ sent back to the US. There were 1.5 hours left before boarding time for my next\
  \ flight. Not wanting to give up, I slipped out of the office, ran back to the gate\
  \ and scanned the floor again. An airport police office came over and asked what\
  \ was happening because I looked insanely sketchy in the middle of a nervous breakdown\
  \ a la Bryce Dallas Howard in that Black Mirror episode. I explained the situation.\
  \ He chuckled a bit because I'm unintentionally funny and made a phone call. When\
  \ he got off the phone, he said, \"Be right back. Wait here.\" \n\nAfter ten excruciating\
  \ minutes, he reappeared down the long corridor. I squinted to see if he had anything\
  \ in his hand, but there was nothing. As he approached, he reached into his back\
  \ pocket, smiled, and pulled out a passport. I ran to him, wrapped my arms around\
  \ him, and squeezed him as tight as I could. It turned out that the passport was\
  \ found by a janitor on the ground outside the gate. I hugged the officer one more\
  \ time, shouted, \"Obrigado! Je t'aime!\" and ran to border security.\n\nFortunately,\
  \ I still had some time to step outside and enjoy the fresh Lisbon air. At least,\
  \ I could still say, \"I visited Lisbon.\" \n\nNew passport stamp achieved."
