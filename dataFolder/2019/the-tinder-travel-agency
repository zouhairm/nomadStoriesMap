Text: "This is the story of how I visited the main cities of northern Portugal using\
  \ Tinder. Hi, my name is Fernanda, I'm 26 years old, and I'm Brazilian. At this\
  \ point, important to say that I had just discovered that I was being betrayed in\
  \ my relationship, which made me quit everything on December 31, 2018. New year,\
  \ new life, I thought. And what a life.\nLuckily, I was scheduled to travel to Portugal\
  \ in January, I would spend 15 days between study and work: I am a lawyer, and I\
  \ was going to take a course in Coimbra and give a lecture on Law in Oporto. I embarked\
  \ alone, trusting that I could use this time away from home and my memories as a\
  \ way to heal my soul.\nI arrived in Coimbra on a cold Sunday night: the restaurants\
  \ were closed, so I bought a snack and ran under my covers. Between one episode\
  \ in a TV series and another, I remembered an advice I had heard from a friend:\
  \ \"Nanda, download Tinder when you're traveling, it's the best way to meet people\
  \ on a short trip.\" Grudgingly, I ended up doing this: I created the simplest free\
  \ profile possible, with a single photo and the following sentence: \"Hi, I'm Brazilian,\
  \ take me to walk around and get to know your city?\"\nThat same night, various\
  \ combinations, and in minutes I was already talking to several guys; at first they\
  \ thought my profile was false, after discovering that I was real, of course I received\
  \ some indecent proposals, but I also received messages from several boys who took\
  \ an interest in taking me to know the sights of Coimbra.\nOut of fear, at the beginning\
  \ I would come up with excuses and complications that would prevent me from dating\
  \ these people, but I realized that my mind was actually putting these blocks on\
  \ account of my previous relationship. And it was at this moment that I decided\
  \ to free myself from the moorings and accept the first invitation.\nI agreed to\
  \ go out with a nice stranger who invited me to meet Figueira da Foz, a seaside\
  \ town, which he said was the best place to surf in the summer. What convinced me\
  \ in his speech, in fact, was that he also told me that we could pass in the Castle\
  \ of Montemor on the way. I love castles and ruins, so I soon accepted. I got into\
  \ his car still afraid, but within 20 minutes of the road we were already talking\
  \ like old friends, without any trace of the initial tension. It was a great day,\
  \ we left at lunchtime and returned at dusk: we went to the Castle, Figueira, and\
  \ even stopped to eat \"the best crepe in Portugal\", he said. I felt welcomed and\
  \ respected all the time, and from this first positive experience, I decided that\
  \ I would continue to use Tinder as a travel agency.\nOn my second attempt, another\
  \ boy told me that I could introduce myself to P\xF3voa de Varzim, but that I would\
  \ have to get there from Metro. I said yes and I went. We met there, he showed me\
  \ the city where his mother was born, we ate Francesinha and even went to watch\
  \ a football game in Braga (I had mentioned that I liked football, throughout the\
  \ day he arranged tickets and surprised me with the proposal).\nBut, without a doubt,\
  \ the best experience I had was the third and last, two days before I returned to\
  \ Brazil: I agreed to visit the beautiful and romantic Aveiro with a third boy.\
  \ Detail: he had never been there, and I ended up being more of a guide than him.\
  \ We took a Gondola and, I venture to say, it was love at first sight. We returned\
  \ from there and spent the rest of my stay together. I returned to Brazil healed,\
  \ with a new love and a promise that, as soon as possible, I would return to Portugal\
  \ to see him. We are even planning to live together this year. Thanks to Tinder,\
  \ I met great people, beautiful cities and maybe my future husband."
