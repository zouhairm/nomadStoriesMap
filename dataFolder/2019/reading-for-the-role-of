Text: "\u201CPlease God don\u2019t let me forget my lines\u201D. I mutter to myself\
  \ as my boyfriend drives the long winding roads that will inevitably lead to my\
  \ first audition in Santa Monica, California. Giant billboards featuring all the\
  \ new must-see TV Shows and movies distract me momentarily but the traffic is heavy\
  \ and I feel like I\u2019m about to pass out because of my nerves. I\u2019ve always\
  \ been afraid of auditioning. I try some deep breathing techniques as the car swerves\
  \ this way and that, the sound of honking coming from all directions as the people\
  \ here always have someplace to be. \n\tI slam the car door behind me just as the\
  \ wind kicks up my skirt. The February sun is bright and welcoming but the air is\
  \ still chilly. We\u2019ve arrived at my audition an hour early. My boyfriend places\
  \ his hands over my eyes. \u201CHey!\u201D I scream. \u201CDon\u2019t worry. I have\
  \ a surprise for you.\u201D He says. He leads me down the sidewalk, weaving in and\
  \ out of the crowd that have all come to see\u2026the famous and ever popular Santa\
  \ Monica pier. \n\tIt\u2019s bustling with so much activity that for a moment I\
  \ forget about my audition. Sprinkled among the huge crowds of people there are\
  \ a plethora of food stands, the freshest being the hand peeled fruit where merchants\
  \ yell out \u201CMango, mango mango!\u201D as you walk past. A little girl runs\
  \ into an arcade where I notice hidden in a corner, a Zoltar machine. An electronic\
  \ man inside four glass walls will tell your fortune if you give him a dollar. It\u2019\
  s from the famous movie \u201CBig\u201D. It seems like everything is Hollywood themed\
  \ here, including the people. I can\u2019t get to the machine because it\u2019s\
  \ being blocked by a twenty-something girl wearing nothing but a low cut bikini\
  \ with perfect on-trend makeup, posing drastically for an Instagram picture. \n\t\
  Everywhere you look, people in Santa Monica want to be noticed. Everyone is looking\
  \ at everyone, hoping to see or be the next big thing. Like the street performer\
  \ to my right who\u2019s dressed in head to toe shiny neon, desperately trying to\
  \ sell his album. As cheesy as it is, I can relate to that. That might be partly\
  \ why I became an actor in the first place. To be someone special.\n    Suddenly\
  \ all I can hear is excitable screaming. Hidden halfway down the pier is a mini\
  \ amusement park, packed with tiny but effective rides, including a giant Ferris\
  \ wheel! My boyfriend and I rush to the line and hop on. We\u2019re thrust into\
  \ the air smoothly and quickly and suddenly my whole perspective shifts. I can see\
  \ the entire Santa Monica coastline. It\u2019s windy up here but oh so beautiful\
  \ with the seagulls drifting above us and the waves crashing into the shoreline\
  \ below us.  I stare out at the open ocean, contemplating my career in show business.\
  \ Wondering if all this painstaking worry is worth it or if I should just quit.\
  \ \n      I look over at a group of kids in front of us laughing and screaming as\
  \ they take selfies in their seats. They\u2019re really enjoying themselves. Maybe\
  \ that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. Having fun. The top of this Ferris wheel really\
  \ is the perfect place to contemplate life in its deepest forms. The breeze running\
  \ through my hair, the sun warming my shoulders, a warm gooey pretzel in my hands,\
  \ my boyfriend by my side\u2026it couldn\u2019t be more ideal for some soul searching.\
  \  I feel my anxiety melt away. As I stare out at the open sea it seems I have found\
  \ a sense of relief and now, just like those excitable kids in front of us, I\u2019\
  m ready to go have some fun at my audition."
