Text: "I was on a year abroad and spent a semester in Padova, Italy. When I wasn\u2019\
  t studying I mostly spent my time exploring the area and the cities around me but\
  \ little did I know that the love of my life was a town over. In this day and age\
  \ it comes as no surprise that online dating apps are the same across the globe,\
  \ and though I rarely use them, I took a chance one weekend and I matched with a\
  \ boy that ended up changing my life. Our first date included discovering the local\
  \ cities as well, and hiking up and down a giant hill to the castle ruins at the\
  \ top. I have always been in love with the Italian culture; the language and way\
  \ of life but matching with this man made me fall even more in love with everything\
  \ about this world. Unfortunately I had to move to Spain for my second semester\
  \ of my year abroad and although, that usually would have been an amazing adventure\
  \ in itself, it meant moving miles away from the best man I had ever met. We decided\
  \ to take a stab at making a long distance relationship work, made easier by modern\
  \ technology and face timing on iPhones every night, but it was and still is one\
  \ of the hardest challenges I have ever faced. Being a student, I do not exactly\
  \ have the funds to be able to fly back and forth whenever I want to see him, but\
  \ every last bit of money I do have, I try to spend on seeing him and spending the\
  \ weekends with him. The real kicker though is that he is in the army, and he has\
  \ to go on trips for training every month, so though I want to spend the weekends\
  \ with him, he will be away practicing shooting new weapons or canvassing a new\
  \ area. I am always worried about him and I am undoubtedly always missing him but\
  \ I know that soon enough, he will be back and I will see him and be able to hold\
  \ him until we have to part again. I will try my hardest to savour every moment."
