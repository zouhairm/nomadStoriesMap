Text: "\u2018You should try everything twice, in case the first time you weren\u2019\
  t quite ready for it yet\u2019 - these words that stuck to my impressionable 12\
  \ year old mind came from the mouth of a chef that resembled one of those laughing\
  \ Buddha statues. He traveled the world in search of exotic flavors, and this time,\
  \ the topic was a prickly situation by the name of \u2018durian\u2019, a fruit notorious\
  \ for its peculiar taste and texture.\nThe advice remained burnt in my memory as\
  \ a silent mantra in life. The word \u2018durian\u2019 on the other hand was thrown\
  \ in the miscellaneous area, tagged \u2018random table-time conversation\u2019.\
  \ It never came up.\n\nIt would be almost 20 years before I casually bumped into\
  \ the king of fruit once more, this time on my own turf\u2019. As I pranced into\
  \ the office one morning, our kitchen table donned a plate of candies, clad in pale-yellow\
  \ wrapping. \u2018It\u2019s Durian toffee. I brought them from Thailand\u2019, a\
  \ colleague explained. I picked a piece and my brain refocused for first contact\
  \ with the elusive fruit flavor of culinary mythology. As I pulled the candy closer\
  \ to my face, I braced myself, expecting a stench of death, fish and onions. I finally\
  \ threw it in my mouth and began to chew, but the shock never came. Raising an eyebrow\
  \ at the taste, I placed it under unsuccessful attempts of fruit flavoring and moved\
  \ on.\n\nA few months later the tides brought me to Malaysia, visiting a friend.\
  \ Reading up on what to do, my old \u2018acquaintance\u2019 came up on the list,\
  \ and we stared each-other through the screen. This time it\u2019s a show down for\
  \ sure. \n\n\u2018No durian in the house\u2019 my friend postulated as the only\
  \ rule of my visit. It felt forbidden, and like all things forbidden, it must be\
  \ had. The streets of Kuala Lumpur quickly brought me face to face with the real\
  \ thing, yet it still eluded me, ever present on the streets but never on my plate.\
  \  \nIn a moment on frenzy, passing through the fruit market, I took a whiff of\
  \ a cling foil covered fruit. The round, pale-yellow flesh was so close, I could\
  \ almost touch it with my cheek. The cling foil firmly separated us, yet I could\
  \ feel a mild, familiar scent. \n\nLuckily, it seems that everything in Malaysia\
  \ can come in durian flavor: cake durian, ice-cream durian, bread-spread durian,\
  \ and even puff pastry filled with a heavy dollop of durian-flavored cream - a perfect\
  \ start.\nClutching the paper bag on my way back, I couldn\u2019t help feeling slightly\
  \ naughty about bringing this particular pastry back to my friends house. It wasn\u2019\
  t technically the fruit itself, so it\u2019s ok, righ? I gorged on the puff with\
  \ the intensity of a child who had accessed the sweets pantry. It would not be enough.\
  \  \n\nA few days later, an opportunity would come. \nOne evening  while looking\
  \ for food, my friends and I came across a winding alley way. We stepped through\
  \ it eagerly with adventure on our minds  and before we knew what we were heading\
  \ towards, the scent hit us through the humid air: durian. Sweet peculiar scent\
  \ loomed in the area an I caught a glimpse of a durian filled restaurant. This was\
  \ it. \n\nThe following evening I ran off on my own. Nobody would stop me. I\u2019\
  d never sat down in a restaurant before in order to eat fruit. I was invited to\
  \ a box of disposable gloves. Durian eating is no joke. The area had an aura of\
  \ durian scent that lingered in the air a few meters outside. And it really seems\
  \ you don\u2019t want it on your hands. I am presented a slice of durian \u2013\
  \ gloves on and for a moment I hold my breath and savor the plump look of the yellow\
  \ flesh, then before i could blink, I had thrown a piece in my mouth. I was ready\
  \ to swallow it quickly like some bad medicine, but it hit me: tropical tasting,\
  \ creamy, sweet, hinting to apple and jackfruit and with an aftertaste of strong\
  \ cheese, all in a subtle gradient. Certainly no need for wise mantras here, one\
  \ more durian please!"
