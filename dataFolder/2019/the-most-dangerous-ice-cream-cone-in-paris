Text: "\u2014 Did you hear? Last night a young guy got knifed right over there in\
  \ that corner.\n\nLaurie pointed towards the bistro where I had lunch the day before.\
  \ The statement should\u2019ve surprised me more, considering that I was still within\
  \ the confines of central Paris, but this was La Chapelle. Over the last few days\
  \ of my stay here, I had learned that it was notable for being the \u201Cmoins bien\u201D\
  \ (less well-off) neighborhood in the French capital. This, as one Uber driver pointed\
  \ out to me, is one of the few places where the rent is still cheap, but also were\
  \ most Parisians come to buy drugs. \n\nThat driver had done little to ease the\
  \ dread that I felt the first time I walked among streets of La Chapelle, carrying\
  \ all of my belongings for three months in a camping backpack, so obviously a tourist\
  \ among idle beggars and clusters of young men carelessly smoking weed. During a\
  \ ride home later that day, after dark, the Uber guy kept going on and off about\
  \ how it was a bad idea for a traveler to stay there. \n\n\u2014 Most of these guys\
  \ are on drugs... look at him!\u2014 He exclaimed as he took a hard right, pointing\
  \ at a young man who, honestly, just seemed to be walking home. \n\nLocal newspapers\
  \ didn\u2019t help either. Although I\u2019m a young man, I didn\u2019t get any\
  \ reassurance from headlines like \u201CResident group claims women have become\
  \ \u2018endangered species\u2019 in heart of Paris\u201D, \u201C'No-go zone' for\
  \ women? How street harassment in Paris boiled over\u201D, along with Reddit threads\
  \ like \u201CIs la Chapelle really that dangerous\u201D, where one found comments\
  \ such as: \n\n\u201CI had a gang dealing coke from my basement which took 1 year\
  \ to get the cops to do something about and a bunch of organized squatters living\
  \ on my floor but there was never any violence, other than the guys destroying our\
  \ mailboxes and the glass door of the building\u2026 \u201D \n\nShattered glass\
  \ and the occasional drug bust, all right. But since the rent was cheap and still\
  \ a 10-minute walk to Sacre Coeur, I guess people like Laurie stuck around. Laurie\
  \ is an American expat. She runs a little brasserie with her French husband that\
  \ recreates American BBQ with local-only products. \n\nIn the same conversation\
  \ in which she described how, according to what she heard, the young guy had been\
  \ stabbed a couple of meters away during some sort of gang dispute, she said that\
  \ it was pretty cool that I was staying in their neighborhood. I was lucky to be\
  \ far from the crowds that have made Paris almost unbearable to visit. Excited to\
  \ share some of her favorite local spots, she started firing pearls at me. \n\n\u2014\
  \ It\u2019s really not that bad! Look, a couple of blocks that way you got the Aerosol\
  \ Maquis-art Hall of Fame and they usually got cool expos there. \n\nBeing that\
  \ it was a Sunday and I really didn\u2019t want to face the group tours at the Louvre\
  \ or the prospect of coming back after dark, I decided to take Laurie up on her\
  \ recommendation. I finished eating and started venturing up towards the Gare Rosa\
  \ Parks, farther from central Paris than I ever imagined I would care to go. \n\n\
  After a good five or six blocks of nothing but concrete and the occasional Sri-Lankan\
  \ restaurant, the map led me to a chain-link fence and a little dirt path that went\
  \ up to what seemed like an abandoned warehouse. \n\nHere I started having second\
  \ thoughts. Maybe Laurie was just having some good fun at my expense sending me\
  \ to explore the sketchier part of the neighborhood, just to show me that I could\
  \ take it. Maybe she thought I needed some toughening up. As I strode uphill to\
  \ the warehouse, I found miles and miles of graffiti. Between the walls that bled\
  \ art, there was\u2026 a food truck park. Inside them, a street art museum. Families\
  \ sat on picnic tables having hamburgers, kebabs, and gelato. I sat there licking\
  \ an ice cream cone with little kids rollerblading around me, feeling more and more\
  \ like a fool, yet very much at peace."
