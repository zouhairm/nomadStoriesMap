Text: "Jochen Z\xE4schmar and I rose with the first break of dawn. I had set two alarms\
  \ to make sure I wouldn\u2019t oversleep and I slowly gathered my things from across\
  \ the cabin. The \nManawanui [M\u0101ori: patient, unwavering] was lying calmly\
  \ in the bay off shore from Opua waiting patiently for the day to begin and gulls\
  \ were circling above the water in search for their first meal of the day when I\
  \ stepped out onto the deck. Since yesterday I was with Jochen on his boat and today\
  \ we were going to join Ingrid Visser to look for orcas. We would meet her further\
  \ up the coast, in Mangonui, about an hour away. Both Jochen and Ingrid were marine\
  \ biologists who found their passion in the water, Ingrid had dedicated her life\
  \ to understand the behaviour of orcas and Jochen had devoted himself to observing\
  \ and studying pilot whales along the New Zealand coast. They had both warned me\
  \ that it would be a cold, wet and long day with a slim chance of actually encountering\
  \ an orca but nevertheless I could not hide my excitement when Jochen and I drove\
  \ down the empty roads to meet Ingrid. \n\nThe little boat, not more than four meters\
  \ long, was rapidly bumping across the waves and it got increasingly colder with\
  \ the wind blowing spray into my face. We had been on the boat for about an hour\
  \ making our way towards the open ocean. On the way we had stopped to talk to some\
  \ fishermen, who were patiently waiting for deep sea fish to snap for bait. Fishermen\
  \ and orcas had a long history together, with the cetaceans outsmarting the anglers\
  \ constantly. When the crew would reel up their catch, orcas would swim past and\
  \ steal the fish from the hook. Needless to say the fishermen didn\u2019t share\
  \ our enthusiasm so we continued our journey. \nWe had been on the boat for almost\
  \ three hours when I realized I had to use the bathroom. Ingrids\u2019 boat did\
  \ not have a toilet, which meant the only way to deal with my circumstance was to\
  \ pee off the stern. I tried to awkwardly hold on to the rail next to the motor\
  \ and pee while the boat was slowly making its way through the blue when Ingrid\
  \ suddenly made a jump.\nHold on tight Malika, I will speed up. I think orcas are\
  \ feeding a few hundred meters away from here.\nBefore I could say anything I was\
  \ flying across the water with my derriere hanging 5 centimetres above the waves,\
  \ hoping I was strong enough to hold on to the rail. When Ingrid finally slowed\
  \ down I exhaled deeply: I did not fall into the water after all! I could hear the\
  \ screeching of seabirds which hectically circled above the water and I was about\
  \ to hop back into the boat to see what was going on when I heard a splash left\
  \ and right from me. My heart started racing and all thoughts of my full bladder\
  \ were pushed to the back of my mind. The world turned silent as I slowly looked\
  \ to the left where I saw a fin ascending and then to the right where I stared directly\
  \ into the eye of a massive orca surfacing only meters away from me. I looked up\
  \ to see if anyone else noticed the creatures but everyone kept staring ahead at\
  \ the seabirds. I was afraid to make any rapid movements or speak so I just hung\
  \ there and watched the orca watching me. To say I wasn\u2019t scared would be a\
  \ lie, these cetaceans are called Killer whale for a reason after all. But to my\
  \ surprise I could only stare at this beautiful black eye gazing at me curiously.\
  \ And suddenly I started laughing because I realized how ridiculous I must look\
  \ with my rear end hanging off the stern with an orca on each side. This was definitely\
  \ not what I had expected to find when setting out this morning. My laugh must have\
  \ broken the silence because as quietly as they ascended, both orcas vanished into\
  \ the deep blue again."
