Text: "Thinking about Malaysia, the first things that come up in my mind are pictures.\
  \ Impressively colourful, anyone representing a different place or amazing adventure.\
  \ And above all, any of them seems from a different country. This is the most extraordinary\
  \ part of Malaysia, I guess: such a melting pot of cultures, that one day you feel\
  \ in India, surrounded by people in trance pierced all over their body, carrying\
  \ heavy altars during the Thaipusam festival, or you could be dancing Punjabi music\
  \  with thousands of youngsters, throwing coloured powder and yelling \u201CHappy\
  \ Holi Festival\u201D.\n \nAnother day you are in the middle of the jungle, because\
  \ that\u2019s actually where you\u2019re living, the centre you\u2019ve been assigned\
  \ to, with Orang Asli people. Monkeys enter in your house and steal your food, kids\
  \ don\u2019t want to come to the class cause they saw a spirit, and you share the\
  \ mattress with another girl and many other not invited guests (talking about insects,\
  \ unfortunately). You end up in a ritual where the shaman covers his arms and face\
  \ with sticky paint made of rice flour, and some people wearing wooden-made clothes\
  \ dance and play typical music.\n \nAnother day you feel in an Arabic country: you\u2019\
  re the only girl in all the village that shows her hair, you are asked to dress\
  \ \u201Cproperly\u201D (which means to cover completely your legs and arms even\
  \ if the average temperature is around 32\xB0), alcohol is forbidden -drinks and\
  \ food too during Ramadan-, and all the day long you listen to the muezzin chanting\
  \ pieces of the Quran.\n \nSometimes you feel in China, especially around the beginning\
  \ of February when it\u2019s Chinese New Year, every market sells tons and tons\
  \ of mandarins, and everything seems about lucky, wealth and getting rich. Or when\
  \ you finally escape from the spicy food going to the Chinese neighbourhood that\
  \ almost any city has, where any decoration is red and gold, red and gold.\n \n\
  You will prove the real meaning of inequality. Waking up on the floor, having a\
  \ shower using a bucket in a common toilet, but the very same night swimming in\
  \ an infinity pool on the top of a building with the view of the Petronas Towers.\n\
  You will see how family is important, when anyone has 6-7 siblings, they respect\
  \ over any limit their parents and the main entertainment is spending time together.\
  \ You will discover how different the concept of love is: first marry a person,\
  \ then day by day know him/her, learn how to love and keep alive the relationship.\
  \ You will experience different kinds of friendship. It could be singing in a karaoke\
  \ bar for four hours with a group of 50-year-old men, the only ones with whom you\
  \ can share some not-too-prudish jokes. Or it could be organizing an arts festival\
  \ with a local artist you met by chance, that introduces you to all the last handcraft\
  \ makers of the region, brings you around by bicycle or with a fisherman boat listening\
  \ to Tom Waits. Or it could be trying several different baju kurung (the typical\
  \ cloth) with a lovely local girl, and see her eyes shining when you also decide\
  \ to try the headscarf and to go to the Mosque to pray.\nAt the same time, you will\
  \ probably also spend a quite big amount of nights in your bed crying. You will\
  \ ask yourself why you ever decided to come here, what are you doing, discovering\
  \ more about your incompetence than your skills, craving for any kind of physical\
  \ contact, your piano, and feeling completely alone and abandoned. You may also\
  \ decide to go back earlier and leave the project, cause you feel useless and that\
  \ your activities are unappreciated. But then, you don\u2019t do it.\nYou may fall\
  \ in love with clouds. After being in amazing paradisiac places, you could just\
  \ realize that the most fascinating landscape you have ever seen are those cute,\
  \ pretty, bubbling white clouds on the horizon that you see every day in Terengganu.\
  \  \n \nYou may finally feel guilty because, well, you realize that the most gorgeous\
  \ experiences that you had and filled your mind with memories, happened mostly outside\
  \ your working schedule.\nBut then, you don\u2019t."
