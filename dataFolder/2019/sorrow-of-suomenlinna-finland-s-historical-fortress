Text: "We are sitting on the wooden stairs of Suomenlinna, a centuries old sea fortress\
  \ off the shore of Helsinki, Finland. He is looking out to sea, his eyes misty on\
  \ a sunshiny summer day.\n\nHe says, \"This is where they gave us up. They gave\
  \ us up without a fight.\"\n\nHe is a Finn, a Lutheran minister, the father of three\
  \ daughters. What he is talking about is the Finnish War, an often forgotten consequence\
  \ of the Napoleonic Wars. What he is talking about is how on May 3, 1808, the Swedish\
  \ army general Carl Olaf Cronstedt surrendered the fortress, then called Sveaborg,\
  \ to the Russians.  The island fortress, believed at the time to be impregnable,\
  \ was given over with hardly a struggle, and the following year, Finland as a whole\
  \ was surrendered to Russia. \n\nWhat struck me was the words were not angry, or\
  \ even bitter, but rather melancholy. There seemed to be a question in them, a \"\
  why\" almost. Why did this happen to us? Why were we betrayed? Were we worth so\
  \ little to Sweden? Finns like to proclaim themselves as practical and pragmatic\
  \ people not given to outward displays of emotion, so it was a bit surprising that\
  \ something that happened over two hundred years ago seemed to still be so present\
  \ in the Finnish psyche. Other Finns told me that Finland's time under Russian rule\
  \ was actually better than under Swedish rule, but still Cronstedt is considered\
  \ a traitor."
