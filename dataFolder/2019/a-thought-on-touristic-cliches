Text: "I love being a tourist. I'm not one of those travellers that avoid the most\
  \ popular spots. On the contrary, I belive that there is a reason why the touristic\
  \ attractions are attractions. I see them as classics, and that is a reason why\
  \ the classics remains. \n\nI clearly remember the feeling that hit me when I saw\
  \ the Colosseum for the first time. From between the streets I saw a little piece\
  \ of it first, but the grandiosity of thousands of years of history was pure magnestism,\
  \ pulling me towards it like a cartoon that smelled a roasted chicken. It was not\
  \ a feeling I could forge by looking at a picture or reading about the history of\
  \ the place. I needed to see with my own eyes. I came back the other day just so\
  \ I could simply look at it more. \n\nWhat can express the authenticity of a place\
  \ better then the things that make it special? Why is it wrong to love something\
  \ that is loved by so many? As the \"true\" traveller culture judges fanny packs\
  \ and crowds, I'm in my couch daydreaming about pasta, narrow streets and hopefully,\
  \ a room with a view for the Colosseum, in the next time that I'm lucky enough to\
  \ be in one of the most touristic cities in the world."
