Text: "I've always loved traveling and being in a plane made me excited because I\
  \ knew I was going to a new place to explore. But I never expected to be jumping\
  \ out of a plane. On a trip I took a couple years ago, a girl who I met on my trip\
  \ who was from my area had talked to me about going skydiving. That was really the\
  \ first time I had considered it heavily. We talked about it a few times and then\
  \ the thought disappeared once we parted ways after that trip.... until I went to\
  \ Australia. \nI went to Australia May of 2018. The group of people I was with were\
  \ very adventurous. Luckily somebody else was planning the whole adventure or I\
  \ may not have gone through with it. It also helped that more than half of the group\
  \ decided to do it. I kept second-guessing myself and waited until the very last\
  \ minute to sign up. Once I did, I kept thinking \"what did I just do\". Another\
  \ girl and I were freaking out the night before when we had to be up at 5 the next\
  \ morning. She was about to forget about the whole thing and just not go and I was\
  \ the one who had to talk her back into it. Once we got there that morning my adrenaline\
  \ started kicking in. I was excited and nervous at the same time. Once we got in\
  \ the plane and started taking off oh, I knew there was no going back. I had always\
  \ told myself and anyone who talked to me about skydiving that I would be the one\
  \ who would change her mind as she's about to jump out of the plane. People had\
  \ always told me once you're in there you have to jump, and they weren't lying.\
  \ The instructors give you no option to stay behind. As people started to jump,\
  \ it looked like the wind was sucking each person in, it happened so fast. When\
  \ it was my turn, it didn't feel real and I may have forgotten what was happening\
  \ at that moment because I was so scared. I had no control over what was happening\
  \ and once we fell out of the plane so many thoughts were going through my mind\
  \ as I was trying to catch my breath and relax and have fun at the same time. The\
  \ fact that we were over an Australian ocean made it so much better though. The\
  \ views were absolutely amazing and once the parachute was pulled, I knew I would\
  \ make it and I could finally enjoy the ride the rest of the way down. That was\
  \ something I never thought that I would actually do but once I did it, I did not\
  \ regret that decision. That was only one activity that I did on my dream trip of\
  \ a lifetime."
