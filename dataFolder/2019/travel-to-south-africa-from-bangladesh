Text: "My Life Changing Experience in South Africa\n\nSouth Africa is one of those\
  \ places that, once visited, sticks with you long after you\u2019ve left; leaving\
  \ its mark in ways you didn\u2019t anticipate. Whether it\u2019s the people, the\
  \ culture, the scenery or some combination of all of the above, there is something\
  \ about the country that compels you to want to explore more. Travel South Africa\
  \ and experience the best the \"world in one country\" can offer you: adventures,\
  \ beaches, country places, cultural exposure, exciting cities, family holidays,\
  \ historic places, heritage sites, wildlife and so on. \n\nEverything in Madikwe\
  \ was memorable and outstanding, starting with the welcoming of the beautiful smiles.\
  \ The beautiful architecture, the notes on the bedside table, the bottles of water\
  \ with our names on them. A memory for a lifetime. Madikwe, I couldn't ask for more.\
  \ It was absolutely fabulous in every single way possible.\n\nCape Town, my next\
  \ destination, also left me enlightened. The Table Bay Hotel was such a warm and\
  \ luxurious place to be, I enjoyed every moment there. Cape Town is such a beautiful\
  \ place filled with a diversity of people, languages, tastes and music with a spectacular\
  \ view. The Falls are absolutely spectacular. This is the glory of creation!  The\
  \ five days in Cape Town were life-changing. The knowledge I took from this trip\
  \ has us wanting to come back. I visited schools, vineyards, climbed mountains\u2026\
  \ endless shopping, endless culture and wildlife.\n\nNext I visited Kruger Park\
  \ safaris. In Kruger Park one can choose from a variety of accommodation options,\
  \ from tents to luxury lodges, and from here they can take in the amazing sights\
  \ the Kruger Park has to offer. Some tourists might think a safari in the Kruger\
  \ Park involves slow, sedate game drives where nature-lovers gaze through their\
  \ binoculars at the wildlife peering demurely from behind the trees in the distance.\
  \ But more often than not, the animals of the Kruger Park get up close and personal\
  \ with the humans venturing into their domain. Tourists from all over the world\
  \ have returned from Kruger National Park tours in South Africa with a whole list\
  \ of fascinating encounters to share with their friends.\n\nNext trip was from Ode\
  \ to Kwazulu, The African coast and the Indian Ocean, is where to see this lovely\
  \ motionTo watch this phenomenon takes no time, to appear and then to rise and shine.\
  \ So if you want to see it in the morning, you must be there early not at dawn\n\
  This site will live with you for evermore, like the ships that sail from sea to\
  \ shore. The sky mainly a hue of blue in season, can change in summer with rain\
  \ the reason But most days can be planned for play, except when it\u2019s a cricket\
  \ day Especially in the Durban town, that cricket days rained off is renown There\
  \ are plenty other things to do, with shops that are the very best to view Casinos\
  \ to play if that\u2019s your thing, well worth a visit though not gambling The\
  \ Aquarium is always popular to be at, to see our fishy friends in their habitat\
  \ Or to the Indian market now in-doors, with herbs and spices to tickle your nose\
  \ Then there are Durban Hotels along the Promenade, for beer or tea or lemonade.\
  \ Natal, Province of the Zulu nation, a jewel of God\u2019s creation\nA thousand\
  \ hills they call their home, not seven like our brothers in Rome People colored\
  \ black white and browns, inhabit mostly in the towns Where they live and play together\
  \ without tuition, since they got the new constitution And everyone that\u2019s\
  \ a good fellow, can thank their stars for Nelson Mandela This man that all of us\
  \ admire, and wish that he did not have to retire We hope that he has taught his\
  \ brothers well.\n\nThat\u2019s all about my experience. If I say in a Nutshell,\
  \ No matter what\u2019s on your travel wish list, South Africa will most likely\
  \ tick all the right boxes. It is a country of sheer natural beauty, welcoming smiles\
  \ and friendly people, rich history and cultural heritage, some of the best beaches\
  \ and accommodation on the planet, and one of the best places on Earth for game\
  \ viewing."
