Text: "My buddies and I embarked on a trip to the beautiful Kingdom of Swaziland.\
  \ Swaziland is a small landlocked nation in Africa. We filled up the tank and drove\
  \ for about 8 hours. As we drove, we marvelled at the beautiful scenery, had great\
  \ conversations, danced to music, and ruffled each other\u2019s feathers :-).\n\n\
  We finally arrived in Swaziland late in the evening, tired and hungry. Since we\
  \ only had a breakfast booking at the lodge and on a tight budget, we didn\u2019\
  t want to waste money on restaurant food. Fortunately, one of my friend\u2019s mom\
  \ had been kind enough to prepare padkos (roadfood) in the form of breyani for us.\
  \ But, we had a slight problem because we arrived later than planned in Swaziland\
  \ and the breyani was cold. \n\nWe asked the lodge staff to help us heat it up,\
  \ but the said it was against hotel policy to do so. We were irritated by this and\
  \ one of my buddies who can be dramatic at times kept insisting that they will not\
  \ eat cold food. So, with our Tupperware container in hand, we decided to go to\
  \ the nearest shopping centre with the hope of finding a Woolworths food store.\
  \ The strategy was, we were going to buy something at Woolworths that we could heat\
  \ up in the customer microwave. After heating that up we would quickly sneak our\
  \ breyani inside the microwave whilst we surveyed the place, making sure none of\
  \ the staff caught us, lol silly I know \uF04A, but hey desperation calls for desperate\
  \ measures.\n\nWe arrived at the shopping centre and there was no Woolworths. The\
  \ closest supermarket we could see was Shoprite. We had a bit of a discussion on\
  \ who would be brave enough to ask the people at Shoprite to heat it up for us.\
  \ I don\u2019t recall an agreement per se, but all I remember was, in my hand was\
  \ the Tupperware container charged with the responsibility.\nWe proceed to the hot\
  \ foods section and of course we couldn\u2019t just ask, we needed a strategy. Our\
  \ strategy was, we will pretend like we interested in buying some of the hot foods,\
  \ we looked and the cheapest thing we could buy was \u2018vetkoeks\u2019 (doughnut\
  \ like cakes). We ordered, the lovely lady gave them to us and then she asked, \u201C\
  Anything else?\u201D, and that was our opportunity. I tried to have a poker face\
  \ as I explained our predicament and asked if she would be so kind as to heat up\
  \ our food in the microwave. She looked at me and looked around, there was a moment\
  \ of hesitation in her eyes I could tell, and then, she finally gave in \u2013 she\
  \ agreed. She did a rushed job but I suppose she wanted to help but was afraid of\
  \ her boss, so the breyani was not heated to our liking. We needed another strategy\
  \ as I couldn\u2019t ask her to heat up again but thanked her for her kindness.\n\
  To cut the long story short, we saw a Mugg & Bean just opposite Shoprite, ordered\
  \ coffee and hot chocolate and when our waitress asked, \u201CAnything else?\u201D\
  \ My friend grabbed the opportunity and asked her to heat up the breyani.\n\nBack\
  \ in our lodge room, we finally enjoyed our breyani and laughed about this incident.\
  \ Never in our wildest dreams did we think we will heat up a home cooked meal in\
  \ a fancy coffee shop in another country at that. But as we laughed about this,\
  \ my friend said, \u201CThis just proves that there\u2019s still goodness in humanity.\
  \ Despite the fact that we have crossed the border, we don\u2019t even speak the\
  \ language well, these people willingly satisfied us their customers.\u201D\n\n\
  When I got home I reflected on the trip, from the beautiful scenery, to the wonderful\
  \ hike we facilitated on Saturday and of course the breyani experience. I was amazed\
  \ by the warmth of the Swazi people and made a local connection to South Africa,\
  \ my home. I recalled Mahatma Ghandi words, \u201CThe greatness of humanity isn\u2019\
  t in being human, but in being humane\u201D. It is this humane element that makes\
  \ me say, being African is a great gift."
