Text: "\u201EIt was a summer, when two young Russian guests came to our Ani&Haakien\
  \ Hostel in Rotterdam to do the check-in. They were two friendly guys, maybe a bit\
  \ serious, like people can be :) They were carrying two suspicious long thin hard\
  \ cover bags with them. With big eyes I was fantasizing about two Russian spies\
  \ with guns coming to our Rotterdam.\n\nI asked the guys, what they are doing in\
  \ Rotterdam and what they brought with them. They said they would go to an event\
  \ and that they have their boats with them. So I mumbled a bit \u201EYeah yeah right,\
  \ your floatable boat or what?!\u201C and my fantasy about them continued. They\
  \ spoke poor English so they didn\u2019t understand my joke, as I didn\u2019t understand\
  \ their seriousness.\n\nLater when I went upstairs to do the laundry, I saw the\
  \ \u201Etwo Russian spies\u201C again. They asked me to come in their room as they\
  \ wanted to show me something. I had my doubts but okay, I went inside. They showed\
  \ me two beautiful detailed scale models of motorboats! They were here to join a\
  \ competition for that. So innocent and passionate about it and they are traveling\
  \ all over the whole world to show their beautiful boats.\u201C"
