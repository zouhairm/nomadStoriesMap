Text: "Stepping into through the heavy wooden doors, I glanced around hesitantly.\
  \ I had been told to try the sushi in this area, but for some reason, this seemed\
  \ like the spot to stop. \n\n\u201CUmm\u2026hello?\u201D I called out sheepishly\
  \ in a terrible Japanese accent, and glanced around as I tiptoed forward. \n\nThe\
  \ place was huge. Massive timber framing, covered in wrought iron and the walls\
  \ were an exposed brick. It used to be an old factory, now it was a restaurant.\
  \ An agitated waiter appeared from around the corner. \n\n\u201CHello! I\u2019m\
  \ sorry!\u201D he blurt out, or at least I think that\u2019s what he said. \n\n\u201C\
  Sorry, do you speak English?\u201D I tried to ask in Japanese. I had learned a few\
  \ basic phrases to help myself get by in the last couple weeks. Usually, they understood\
  \ what I was going for. In my experience so far, the local people were all keen\
  \ to help me as much as possible, but it was mostly a crash course discovering universal\
  \ gestures and using words from pop culture. \n\nHe stopped and whirled on the spot,\
  \ grabbed a menu and spun back to face me. \n\n\u201CLittle.\u201D he answered politely\
  \ and pointed at the menu that had \u2018English\u2019 scrawled in bright red bubble\
  \ letters on the bottom. \n\nMy face lit up and I smiled and nodded enthusiastically.\
  \ I was starving! He brought me over to a giant wooden table. It was beautiful,\
  \ with a concrete, rectangular pit placed in the middle. It was a foot deep and\
  \ full of hot coals. I sat down and eyed it curiously, I hadn\u2019t seen something\
  \ like this before. He waited for me to settle and then opened the menu and pointed\
  \ at the drink options. I understood and ordered something, pointing and saying\
  \ \u201Ccan I have this please?\u201D. Or at least, I hope that was what I was saying.\
  \ Whatever I said, he understood, nodding and scribbling something before darting\
  \ off. Looking after him, I realized that I was the only person there. \n\nThe food\
  \ I ordered appeared, the meat was raw and ready for the coals. I began to grill\
  \ the meat. He stood watching from roughly fifteen feet away. Horrified by what\
  \ I was doing, he rushed over and intervened. Swiping the meat from my hands, he\
  \ rearranged everything and pointed and nodded at me. I smiled and laughed, thanking\
  \ him profusely. He came back a few minutes later and removed the meat, clearly\
  \ not trusting me to finish the job. \n\n\u201CWow!\u201D I exclaimed, taking a\
  \ bite of juicy deer sausage. \u201CSo delicious!\u201D I squealed, pointing at\
  \ the meat and giving him a big thumbs up. He seemed pleased and left, returning\
  \ with more water. After the glass was full, he stood next to me quietly, and I\
  \ looked at him quizzically. \n\n\u201CYou like music?\u201D He asked shyly in English,\
  \ pointing to the headphones dangling from my around my neck. \n\n\u201CAh! Yes,\
  \ I love it. Do you?\u201D I returned, brightening at the conversation. I had been\
  \ travelling alone for a few weeks and while everyone was wonderfully polite, they\
  \ were not keen to connect. \n\n\u201CYes!\u201D He said, and then seemed to relax\
  \ further, \u201CWhat kind? Where are you from? Do you like Otaru?\u201D he continued\
  \ enthusiastically.\n\nHe darted away and came back, dragged a shy and reluctant\
  \ line cook behind him. \u201CThis is my friend, Yuto. He speaks excellent English.\
  \ Speak Yuto!\u201D He ordered. His friend looked at him, then back at me. \n\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m not very good at it\u2026\u201D he answered eventually, looking at the\
  \ floor. \n\n\u201CMuch better than my Japanese!\u201D I answered, smiling warmly\
  \ as I scooped up the last of my food. \n\nAfter paying my bill, my friend, who\
  \ never actually introduced himself stood waving by the table , elbowing his friend\
  \ in the ribs to do the same. Eventually, Yuto caved and joined in. I waved back\
  \ and turned to the hostess, who seemed to be a manager of sorts, to pay my bill.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThank you so much! I hope you had a lovely meal.\u201D she said in English,\
  \ waving politely. \n\n\u201COne of the best I\u2019ve ever had!\u201D I answered,\
  \ waving back. \n\nIt honestly was."
