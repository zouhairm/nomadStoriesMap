Text: "As a U.S. native it doesn\u2019t sound like much of an adventure in comparison\
  \ to the more exotic destinations that are out there. However as someone who comes\
  \ from the east coast, California is far more exotic than it lets on. The flight\
  \ from BWI to LAX alone allows for a brief tour of the United States by simply glancing\
  \ out of my window. The hills painted with green trees slowly turn to rocky mounds\
  \ of mountain and finally the ever curious smog lets you know that you are in fact\
  \ no longer on the east coast. California is one of the most versatile states I\
  \ have seen in my life time. Redlands specifically is an understated beauty, with\
  \ an abundance of local shops and restaurants, citrus trees and sunlight. From almost\
  \ any angle that you stand you can see the mountains that surround you gently gazing\
  \ back at you. After driving a little over an hour you can find yourself back in\
  \ the snowy hills, the middle of the desert or on the beach with a plate of tacos.\
  \ Not to exclude the rich history within the museums scattered around the state\
  \ and the ever accesible music festivals and events. Southern California offers\
  \ more than one theme for potential  travelers, which is why you cannot just go\
  \ once and feel like you have even scratched the surface.  The choices are continuous\
  \ and you can\u2019t help but want to come back for more."
