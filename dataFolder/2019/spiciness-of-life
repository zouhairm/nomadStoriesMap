Text: "For the person who have never eaten a spicy food and who have been living in\
  \ the place, where the population of the whole country is only 18 million, it was\
  \ tremendously interesting and fascinating, but at the same time so unusual and\
  \ a little bit scary to move to a completely different place with different people\
  \ and to be honest with different everything, starting from the society and ending\
  \ with technology. My name is Alibek, and in this essay I am going to make an individual\
  \ subjective analysis about my first study travel to China.\nPreviously, before\
  \ coming to China, I already have been abroad to countries like UK, Serbia, Turkey\
  \ and Russia, for different purposes. So I already had gathered fulfilling amount\
  \ of knowledge about travelling life and the culture shock wasn\u2019t something\
  \ new for me or even something scary. Consequently, when I was just about to take\
  \ off and finally go to China, I thought that I was ready and nothing could confuse\
  \ me. However, no sooner have I arrived to China, when I understood that all my\
  \ knowledge, that I had, was incomplete. \nTo begin with, here comes my first ever\
  \ experience of eating a spicy food in HKC nearby the international students\u2019\
  \ dormitory. However, little did I know that almost not spicy food in China would\
  \ be a super spicy for my tongue. I have hardly ended up having my first meal in\
  \ HKC by drinking liters of water after that. That is the simplest reason why I\
  \ haven\u2019t eaten anything for the next day. Above all we, me and my roommate,\
  \ also had to go through the acclimatisation, because the weather of Hangzhou was\
  \ very hot and rainy. \nHowever, beside those physical and climate differences,\
  \ I also have faced with cultural ones. After a few days of adaptation period I\
  \ started to face with new amazing things as Citizens\u2019 openness and their fashion.\
  \ Of course both Kazakhstani and Chinese people have their own view on fashion and\
  \ daily look, although I have admitted that the way Chinese people dress up is more\
  \ colorful, shiny, interesting and I little bit bizarre for us. For instance, some\
  \ of the Chinese people may wear a baggy yellow T-shirt and tightened red trousers,\
  \ which I think is the way person shows his or her individuality, but that definitely\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be acceptable in my home country. Also, obviously not all Chinese\
  \ people dress up like that, however generally, if you walk down the streets in\
  \ China, it is ten times more likely for you to see this kind of style than anywhere\
  \ else.\nFurthermore, fashion isn\u2019t the only thing where Chinese people combine\
  \ things in a strange for us way. So, now I want to talk about food again. After\
  \ a month living in China, I have understood that local people and Chinese people\
  \ in general love to mix many different flavors by adding variety of different products.\
  \ The difference here is that actually we never mix sugary sweet things with salty\
  \ or spicy ones, but here people can find a melted sweet sugary cheese on the top\
  \ of bread with a sweet cream. In fact it is very delicious and at the same time\
  \ a new thing for me. Moreover, I have never seen so many different flavor variety\
  \ for the chocolates such as Kit Kat with a flavor of green tea or chocolate with\
  \ a flavor of meet, and because I haven\u2019t seen anything like this in UK, Serbia\
  \ or Turkey, I have concluded that China is the only country where you can find\
  \ those kind of products.\nOverall, this first month in China have opened a new\
  \ door of exploration for my life, during which I have seen so many great and ridiculous,\
  \ new and strange things for me.\nDespite the fact that I already knew that each\
  \ country has its own unique culture, here I have additionally convinced myself\
  \ that Chinese culture consists of a tremendous background of history and uniqueness,\
  \ which created a great individual eastern atmosphere. All in all, I always thought\
  \ that difference is the main beauty of any culture or nation, and now I have additionally\
  \ proved it for myself again."
