Text: "Tired of daily routine , I decided to take a break & the first thing came to\
  \ my mind is a solo trip.yes!The place I belong to , you wont find much solo tripper\
  \ & girls, even rarer.Still I made up my mind after a lot of dilly-dallying.The\
  \ place I chose was ''Pondicherry''. Because it was near to my city where I live\
  \ & less expensive to travel(money matters dude) . Its an union territory situated\
  \ in the southern region of Indian subcontinent.It came to prominence after French\
  \ East India company came here & colonised here. Before that it was ruled by regional\
  \ kingdoms. Coming to my journey,I ravelled there by bus & it took me a night to\
  \ reach.I reached there & hired one bike. I started visited all the places which\
  \ I could google. I would like mention some of the most interesting places. so,1st\
  \ will be ''White Town''. its situated near the sea shore only. You can get a French\
  \ flavor here. The houses,cafes,food,street names etc. The street names are written\
  \ in French here(obviously! tough to remember ,being an Indian). You will find cafes\
  \ serving filter coffee+croissant with a special discount. You will find some instagram\
  \ worthy houses having unique graffiti as well. The promenade is not as chaotic\
  \ as other beaches in the country,which I really liked.The next thing I want to\
  \ mention is ''Auroville''.Its an experimental township which is the brainchild\
  \ of Shree Maa(Mother Mira Alfassa). Here you can see people living of various nationalities,\
  \ major being Indians, French, Germans respectively,living all in harmony.The remarkable\
  \ feature is ''Matri Mandir''. Its a huge spherical structure used for Yoga practice,to\
  \ concentrate your mind. The third place I would like to mention is ''The Aurobindo\
  \ Ashram\".Its the place where Sri Aurobindo Ghose ,a foreign educated , english\
  \ speaking, freedom started his spiritual journey. Subsequently it became a community\
  \ who also involved themselves in a self realisation journey. Pondicherry, in today's\
  \ date mostly famous for Sri Aurobindo. It celebrates the journey of an extremist\
  \ who renounced everything & became a pacifist. Other than this you will find french\
  \ architecture influnced churches , like ''Eglise de Notre Dame des Anges''. You\
  \ will find French war memorial which was dedicated to the soldiers who lost their\
  \ lives during World War 1. \nOne more place I want to mention here , which I could\
  \ not visit due to my limited time span , is Tranquebar, which is 3hrs ride from\
  \ Pondicherry. Its a place where Danish trading post was establishfor the first\
  \ time in India.You will find fort Dansborg here.Its the 2nd largest Danish fort\
  \ ever constructed.The bay bengal surrounds it in two of its side. \nI should not\
  \ forget a special mention about the food. You will find lots of pizzerias here\
  \ & french bakery product. You can have it with south Indian filter coffee which\
  \ is served in a small brass glass. \nOver all Pondy(fodly called in short) is a\
  \ place which is not so densely populated . Places are not over crowded like other\
  \ Indian cities. For me it was a self discovering episode of life. The peaceful\
  \ beaches were tranquillisers for a really hectic life. Aurobindo's life always\
  \ make us remember that life is uncertain. it keeps on flourishing along with you.\
  \ It always surprises you. \nIts not a big thing to look at a fisherman throwing\
  \ a net into the sea to make his livelihood. But when did we last do that?Its really\
  \ not a herculean task to have a cup of coffee without looking at your cell phones\
  \ for some minutes & enjoying a beach sunset. But when did we last do that?Its not\
  \ wrong to press the pause button of life & take breathe of fresh air.But when did\
  \ we last do that? Still I would say,better be late than never. Try to live not\
  \ survive."
