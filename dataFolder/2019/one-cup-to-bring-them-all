Text: "In a tournament full of upsets, it was only fitting that the final match of\
  \ FIFA World Cup 2018 was a classic fight between the underdog and the favorite.\
  \ France and Croatia were fighting it out for the Championship title for the next\
  \ four years at the Luzhniki Stadium. I was just across the Moskva River at Vorobyovy\
  \ Gory at the jam-packed fan park. The majestic Moscow State University stood looming\
  \ in the background with its spire playing hide and seek with the clouds. It was\
  \ a dreary rainy day in Moscow, a complete contrast to the enthusiastic human spirit\
  \ in the fan park. \n\nI was rooting for the underdogs, Croatia, and around me fans\
  \ of both the countries sported the same tricolours, White, Blue and Red. It didn\u2019\
  t look like the bad weather would dampen any spirits, and once in a while, the sun\
  \ played peek-a-boo. The match was a goal fest, France was leading with four goals,\
  \ and Croatia had managed to sneak in two goals, the latest one at the 69th minute.\
  \ \n\nWith every goal and pockets of the crowd surrounding me screamed with joy,\
  \ at the opposite the other pockets streamed. Would David tame the Goliath? That\
  \ was the biggest question of the day. It wasn\u2019t just the Croatians and French\
  \ fans at the fan park, I was an Indian supporting Croatia, the bunch of boisterous\
  \ English boys next to us had chosen to support France, and on the other side, the\
  \ Mexicans were sporting Croatian hats. Everybody had picked their teams, even the\
  \ ones whose teams had let them down. \n\nThe minutes were inching by, and the tension\
  \ rose, there was a hush across the fan park with the French hoping to finish the\
  \ game on a high note and the Croatians hoping for a miracle. But, today was not\
  \ the day of the underdog, France won, and the fan park erupted! In a situation\
  \ that couldn\u2019t be more dramatic, the heavens opened up, and it started raining,\
  \ it seemed that the gods were celebrating too. \n\nI had come prepared, I quickly\
  \ took out my rain poncho and wore it, but my friends weren\u2019t prepared, so\
  \ I opened up the large poncho and held it over our heads to protect us from the\
  \ rain. People were running helter-skelter to find a place to duck under from the\
  \ rain, opposite me I caught a couple staring at our poncho and I smiled and beckoned\
  \ to them. They were wearing green jerseys with a white crescent moon, and I knew\
  \ where they were from. \n\n\u2018Thanks\u2019, the young girl smiled at me. Her\
  \ brown skin matched mine, and a border all but separated us. \n\n\u2018Are you\
  \ an Indian?\u2019 the man accompanying her asked me, he had seen the Indian flag\
  \ in my friend\u2019s hands. \n\n\u2018Yes, we are from India\u2019, I said, choking\
  \ up with pride for some unfathomable reason. \n\n\u2018We are from Pakistan, so\
  \ nice to meet you\u2019 he said. For over 70 years, our countries had been waging\
  \ both direct and indirect wars at each other. We spoke the same language but are\
  \ torn apart by a border that both dispute. I smiled at looked at my friend about\
  \ this moment of camaraderie that we couldn\u2019t have imagined. \n\nBehind me,\
  \ the Mexican guy from earlier, sporting the sombrero hot joined us under the poncho.\
  \ The space was getting tighter, and he removed his hat to make it comfortable.\
  \ We all held the poncho above our heads to create more space for others who were\
  \ joining in. A couple of Japanese fans, with their flag colors painted on their\
  \ faces, joined us. An African sporting the France colors joined us too, and when\
  \ we thought that was it, we could hold no more, we still found space for an old\
  \ lady with the Croatian Flag swinging. She was ecstatic, and she hugged me out\
  \ of the blue! \n\nI was overwhelmed and making sense of the occasion, when the\
  \ fireworks went off above the Luzhniki Stadium, and we turned to see them, it might\
  \ have been more spectacular without the rain. But then, I wouldn\u2019t have found\
  \ the world around me, all under one poncho!"
