Text: "It feels like time has stopped as I walk through narrow cobbled streets, crowded\
  \ with people going in different directions. A sense of wonder hangs over the city\
  \ as people patiently look for the beauty lying behind every corner. As I reach\
  \ the Old Town Square, the oldest astronomical clock in the world strikes the hour\
  \ and the skeleton next to it turns the hourglass in its hands, reminding us time\
  \ won\u2019t stop for anyone. \n\nReminding me that I have to leave in nine hours,\
  \ and I better make the best of it with what I have. And right now, that is the\
  \ company of Guillermo, an Argentinian man whom a year earlier had chosen Prague\
  \ as his home and since then learnt some secrets about the Wes Anderson film scenery\
  \ that is Czech Republic\u2019s capital city. Secrets he is now sharing with me.\n\
  \nHe grabs my hand and leads me out of the crowd that gathered to watch the tower\
  \ clock\u2019s motion. Along the way, we stop by the astonishing Charles Bridge,\
  \ taking a second to look back at the Old Town. Prague\u2019s medieval architecture\
  \ rises up high, leading to gothic towers with gold ornaments on their top, each\
  \ one of them reflecting the sunlight with the grace of a starry night. As they\
  \ light up the sky of the searing summer day, my eyes, too, cast back the brightest\
  \ glimmer. \n\nWe cross countless alleyways until we walk into what seems to be\
  \ a medieval common hall, with long farmhouse tables and benches. It\u2019s a traditional\
  \ Czech restaurant. The waiter brings us to the table and we sit next to complete\
  \ strangers who immediately acknowledge us with a friendly chat. The sharing tables\
  \ bring a sense of community and openness, enhanced by the ambience music, played\
  \ live by one man. He is wearing very customary Czech clothing: high waisted black\
  \ trousers, a white shirt with a red vest and a hat; and he holds a large accordion,\
  \ playing as he walks through the corridors saluting the customers. He comes closer\
  \ to Guillermo and I, smiling and pointing to the tattoo on my arm.\n\u201CI know\
  \ this! It\u2019s Harry Potter, yes?\u201D We instantly bond. His name is Jozef\
  \ and he loves playing music for tourists and getting to know them. When he finds\
  \ out I\u2019m from Brazil, he plays a Brazilian song for me, and does the same\
  \ thing for Guillermo. He makes us feel welcome and captivates us with kindness.\
  \ We invite him to go out with us afterwards and to our delight he says yes.\n\n\
  One hour later we find ourselves in a stone built establishment that looks like\
  \ it\u2019s been standing for a few centuries. It\u2019s Jozef\u2019s favourite\
  \ spot. We go downstairs into a small room with six tables, an old piano and five\
  \ people: two young women and three older men, sat in two different tables. As we\
  \ sit and start drinking a series of events happen: the ladies, who we find out\
  \ are Belgium, join us at our table and one of the old men starts playing the piano.\
  \ Then, a couple of men from Holland walk in and sit with us as well. The room\u2019\
  s energy rises as we clap to the melodies coming from the piano, and the man, who\
  \ could only speak Czech, asks Jozef to translate his words. He wants to join us.\
  \ \n\nI realize there are five different nationalities around one table. Five different\
  \ cultures and languages; connecting, sharing, making an effort to listen and \n\
  learn about others. Before I know it I\u2019m sitting at the piano with Elke - one\
  \ of the Belgium girls, as the old man teaches us how to play. He doesn\u2019t speak\
  \ English, but he doesn\u2019t have to. Music has become our language of choice.\
  \ \n\nThe harmony of music brings our cultures together and breaks barriers no humane\
  \ force ever could. Those nine hours have now passed, but that moment bas become\
  \ infinite. I fly my way back to London and I can\u2019t stop reliving it and thinking\
  \ to myself that no matter where we came from or the oceans we crossed, there were\
  \ no borders as our hearts danced to the same melody."
