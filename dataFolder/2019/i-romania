Text: "Transylvania. Home of Dracula, home of the first chosen German president of\
  \ Romania, home of large woods and climbable mountains. Home of cheap holidays and\
  \ friendly people. If you would go for a short business trip or travel to Romania\
  \ in one of its biggest cities, you might not feel the difference to other European\
  \ cities, even more maybe appreciate how Romanians have nurtured their love and\
  \ value for tradition, history and nature. This is the place where people use Uber,\
  \ AirbNB and Tinder, where everyone speaks at least English if not more foreign\
  \ languages, the one where you can not tell visitors from inhabitants, the multicultural,\
  \ urban and developed Romania. This will be a happy experience for you on account\
  \ of not having to travel in the country by car, train or bus, of not having to\
  \ deal with the health or educational system. Differently from how things might\
  \ seem from a fast passed industry of travelling, Romania is not one but 2 countries,\
  \ at least. The other one, the dark, poor and disserted Romania is not a discussion\
  \ topic in travelling guides. Fact is that due to its struggling recent past as\
  \ an ex-communist country trying to adapt to capitalism, and also in the light of\
  \ the latest political changes (with PSD being elected and ruling aggressively against\
  \ justice) this discrepancy is getting bigger and bigger.\n\nHere are the most locally\
  \ connected tones regarding Romanians who address their roots:\n\nFirst, the  funny,\
  \ friendly tone that wants to ignore the bigger issues of Romania and of its representation\
  \ concerning poverty, racism, homophobia and misogyny, thus totally ignoring historic\
  \ truth and political implication and embracing the warm protecting coat of American\
  \ fiction: \u201CI am from Transylvania!!!\u201D The land beyond the woods, where\
  \ Dracula still lives and where children drink a glass of blood before going to\
  \ sleep, and yes, you are so right, this is why we do not like garlic, got me there!\n\
  \nSecondly, the critical tone that accepts the situation and also smoothly goes\
  \ along with the interlocutors ignorance: \u201CI am from Romania.\u201D- pronounced\
  \ with an O not with OU- this tone is embracing ignorance as a sign of acceptance,\
  \ meaning Hey, I am from this place- but I could have been from another, let\u2019\
  s not further talk about it, what matters is where we are now not where we were\
  \ born, I am not responsible for my countries history and major discrepancies and\
  \ I don\u2019t intend to start now by continuing this conversation.\n\nMost often\
  \ used, the sympathetic tone: \u201CI am from Roumania\u2026\u201D- I know that\
  \ you know and that you think to understand everything and that you might feel sorry\
  \ for me, but really I also sometimes feel sorry for myself, there is nothing to\
  \ feel sorry about, so at least tonight let\u2019s not get into this and just talk\
  \ to each other as we all are inhabitants of the planet.\n\nLast but not least,\
  \ there is the nationalist tone that mostly comes from people who have not lived\
  \ abroad more than a few months- or totally opposed, from people who have been too\
  \ long away from the country, thus forgetting what they refer to.  \u201CI am from\
  \ Romania!!!!\u201D- as in I am from a very small and special place, that you probably\
  \ could not have heard about in its greatness and beauty, it is like no other place\
  \ on earth, and you are an ignorant not knowing how we Romanians are special from\
  \ other people and our country is the most beautiful country in the world, but even\
  \ if you would go there you would not get it, that\u2019s how special it is, so\
  \ better do not even try to imagine this place, or to try to get me, I am above\
  \ imagination and my country that I left because I could not see any more future\
  \ for myself and my family, does not stand comparison to any of the other countries\
  \ from Europe, which are more or less all the same\u201D. \n\nI have left Romania\
  \ for some years now, and I still didn\u2019t found a comfortable tone to talk about\
  \ where I come from. I miss it every day."
