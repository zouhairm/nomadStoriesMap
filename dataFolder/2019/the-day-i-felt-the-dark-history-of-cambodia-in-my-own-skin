Text: "In the main killing field of the country, at a short drive from Phnom Penh,\
  \ the capital of Cambodia, my family, the tourist guide and I arrived. It is summer.\
  \ Shortly before, our trip escort told us about an unknown period (for an international\
  \ visitor) that killed a third of the nation's population. The regime of the leader\
  \ Pol Pot changed everything in his life: he was subjected to hunger, separated\
  \ from his family, had to live for years in the jungle eating insects to survive,\
  \ lost his father to communist soldiers. In the end, he succeeded in forming a new\
  \ family circle and came to live with his wife and two daughters, all healthy.\n\
  \nI froze in front of a wooden fence. Multi-colored bracelets tied to each stake.\
  \ \"This is the place where hundreds of women and children were buried after they\
  \ were clubbed to death\u201D, the guide said. His expression was motionless. The\
  \ scenes of rape and death being described projected sadness in the site that, that\
  \ day, covered by vegetation, exuded so much peace. The cheerful props made that\
  \ grave stand out from the others.\n\nThe sun was shining brightly. Sweat was running\
  \ down my face. I checked my watch. It was not the hottest time of the day just\
  \ yet. Amidst bone remnants, mortal remains and tattered pieces of clothing, foreigners\
  \ bypassed; their faces displayed outrage, horror, commotion, empathy. Meanwhile,\
  \ the only sound I could hear was the wind stirring the leaves. Terror is now history.\n\
  \nSurrounded by 2x2 meter enclosures and lost in reflections, something brought\
  \ me back to the present moment. \"How do you manage to come here after all that\
  \ you had to go through because of the government? What for?\", I did not hesitate\
  \ to ask the Cambodian. To which he replied almost muttering, leaning against a\
  \ tree: \"I come here every week; it is my job to inform tourists about those days\
  \ so that history may never repeat itself.\""
