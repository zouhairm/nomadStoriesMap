Text: "Disclaimer: I have the ability to get lost on the way between the bedroom and\
  \ the bathroom. So it seemed pretty natural that my parent's reaction to my decision\
  \ to go to Spain by myself working in a hostel was pale faces followed by drops\
  \ of sweat from the forehead.\n\nTo be honest, and trying not to be so hard on myself\
  \ even more than when I try to pronounce gracias with the Spanish c in front of\
  \ a native speaker, the first two months in Madrid didn't go that bad. Although\
  \ at the beginning I would open Google Maps even to search for Gran Via while standing\
  \ in Gran Via, after a couple of weeks I could easily walk around, from a neighborhood\
  \ to another without constantly looking at my phone. *tap on my own shoulder*\n\n\
  Until I arrived in Seville (Sevilla when I wanna look cool). For those of you who\
  \ don't know, in Seville, unlike Madrid, there's no metro, which is incredibly helpful\
  \ to orient. You pay, sit, and wait to get to the destination. A bless.\nIn the\
  \ center of Seville, either you walk or you don't move at all.\n\nMy story takes\
  \ place obviously in one of the two-arms-large streets of the city.\nI was out with\
  \ the people from the hostel, as always. After a night showing off my basic Spanish\
  \ with my classic phrase \"\xBFPuedo Tomar una cerveza y no el chupito?\" to take\
  \ the beer instead of the free shot (yo, volunteering gotta have some pros!), I\
  \ decide it's time for me to go get those three hours of sleep before the morning\
  \ shift. So I reach out for my good old friend in my phone, since it's like my fifth\
  \ day there. The phone is dead. I didn't think it was possible to have lower self-esteem\
  \ than when you try a crop top while wearing low waist jeans, but I was wrong.\n\
  August, 3 am, city center. A desert.\nThere's nobody in the street and frankly,\
  \ I don't even know where I am. Now I really hate myself for not listening to the\
  \ receptionist explaining to me the city map. Let's be honest nobody follows them.\
  \ After the \"we are here\", no idea.\n\nAfter a couple of minutes of random walking,\
  \ hoping to find something familiar, the survival instinct, or the alcohol, you\
  \ choose, takes over.\n\nThe detail that I decided to put at the end, in order to\
  \ make the story more exciting, is that my hostel was right next to the Cathedral.\
  \ Once I find the Cathedral I find the hostel, easy. The problem is I have no idea\
  \ even in which direction the Cathedral is.\nI decide to wait the half hour bells,\
  \ so I could follow the sound and at least find the right direction. Now I didn't\
  \ hate them as much as the same morning when they woke me every half hour.\n3,30\
  \ am. The bells.\nI turn 180 degrees, because obviously I was in the opposite direction\
  \ and go straight.\nAfter ten minutes, hey I know this place, and this tapas bar,\
  \ I turn right and there it is: the Cathedral!\n\nSo proud, for not that much. I\
  \ understand there are people who won't understand how confident a person actually\
  \ get after three weeks in a new city.  We work hard for that, after hours and hours\
  \ wasted on the wrong bus and kilometers easily avoidable. But that's okay. When\
  \ we make it, we couldn't be prouder.\n\nRight after I arrived at the hostel I immediately\
  \ charged my phone, and I've never forgotten after that. But I liked the idea that,\
  \ if needed, I could count on myself.  \nTraveling alone can highlight the best\
  \ of us, those little surprises that, staying in our comfort zone, could never be\
  \ discovered, and could turn into invaluable life lessons, and yeah also a great\
  \ story to tell over a good bottle of wine.\nSo, go pick up that old backpack and\
  \ download hostelworld, we wait here with a glass of wine in our hands, ready to\
  \ hear your story when you come back.\n\xA1Salud e buen viaje!"
