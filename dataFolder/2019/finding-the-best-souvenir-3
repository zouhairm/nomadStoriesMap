Text: "After struggling to safely fit four bottles of wine in my luggage, the only\
  \ thing that\u2019s left to do, before I head to Tbilisi airport, is to buy souvenirs.\
  \ Fortunately, it wouldn\u2019t take up much of my time, for I already know where\
  \ to find the best ones.\n\nIt was my fourth day in Georgia when I came across this\
  \ huge shopping mall looking completely alien against its neighboring buildings.\
  \ However, it wasn\u2019t the glass exterior of the mall that caught my attention;\
  \ but the old people standing out in the cold while holding a once empty cup\u2014\
  now half filled with coins from random strangers.\n\nAs I walked past the mall toward\
  \ the adjacent metro station; where I was supposed to meet with some friends, I\
  \ found myself approaching the lady sitting by a tiny stall filled with keychains,\
  \ magnets and other trinkets of souvenirs. \u201CGamarjoba!\u201D (Hello!) I greeted,\
  \ which she returned with a smile. \u201CHow much?\u201D I pointed at the ref magnet\
  \ that looks exactly like a mini Khinkali: Georgian dumpling stuffed with meat and\
  \ spices. She gestured something with her hands; at first, I failed to understand.\
  \ Keeping her smile, she tried again, this time, I learned 2 things: the price of\
  \ the magnet and that she doesn\u2019t communicate the way ordinary people do.\n\
  \nI looked over the station only to find my friends already waiting for me. I was\
  \ so occupied with the scene earlier that I almost forgot I was headed somewhere\
  \ else. So before racing toward the station, I thanked and assured her that I\u2019\
  ll come back, making a silent promise to myself at the same time.\n\nToday, on my\
  \ last day in Tbilisi, I was greeted by the previous scenario: middle-aged people\
  \ patiently waiting for strangers to fill their empty cups. At the same spot, I\
  \ also found the old lady, only I was a bit early, as she was just setting up her\
  \ displays when I got there.\n\nAfter picking up a handful of items, I was finally\
  \ ready to go home with a bag full of souvenirs for my family and friends. As we\
  \ bid our farewells and held each other into an embrace\u2014I learned a valuable\
  \ thing: no language barrier is impenetrable. For without a single uttered word,\
  \ I clearly heard what she wanted to say. If only she knew it\u2019s the other way\
  \ around; that I am the one who\u2019s grateful. I might\u2019ve been the stranger\
  \ who made her day better, but she gave me something that I will always remember.\n\
  \nThrough her silent voice, I realized that the best souvenir in life is simply\
  \ being a stranger. A stranger who always helps to fill an empty cup."
