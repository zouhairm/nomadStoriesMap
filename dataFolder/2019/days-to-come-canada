Text: "It\u2019s difficult to categorize Canada in terms of a travel destination.\
  \ Being the world\u2019s second-largest country in regards to land mass, you\u2019\
  ll find an extraordinary amount of diversity in the culture, history, as well as\
  \ the natural and man-made attractions.\n\nThere are high mountain ranges, sparse\
  \ plateaus, desert-like areas, forested valleys, stunning lakes, seemingly endless\
  \ prairies, modern cities, as well as a tremendous assortment of flora and fauna.\
  \ Not to mention, there\u2019s a Tim Hortons in almost every city and town across\
  \ the country.\n\nWhether you wish to spend your time hiking through the Rockies,\
  \ learning about the maritime history of the east coast, or exploring the cosmopolitan\
  \ cities of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, this is a country where every traveller\
  \ will find something to their liking.\n\nThe internet, however, is filled with\
  \ articles on Canada\u2019s more well-known sites, that's why I\u2019ve chosen to\
  \ do a more local approach to Toronto and Vancouver :\n\nToronto also known as Queen\
  \ City Hogtown T.O., derived from Toronto, Ontario. T-Dot The Big Smoke The 6ix\n\
  \nToronto is a special city in the world \u2013 it not only embraces the fact that\
  \ 49% of its residents were born outside of Canada but also turns multiculturalism\
  \ into the face of Toronto.\n\nIt is a mecca of delicious food from all over the\
  \ world, amazing shopping, and has a theatre district which rivals that of Broadway;\
  \ it even hosts one of the best film festivals in the whole world.\n\nHere are some\
  \ of the things a local would do:\n\nA stroll down the high park in cherry blossom\
  \ season.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThe trees, or sakura\u2019s, were gifted to Toronto\
  \ by the Japanese government in 1959 as a gesture of goodwill for accepting refugees\
  \ from the country after the Second World War. Those initial trees were planted\
  \ in High Park, the largest grove overlooking Grenadier Pond. This is the most popular\
  \ spot for seeing cherry blossoms in the city.\n\n\n\nA walk through the University\
  \ of Toronto St. George campus along with a tour of the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM).\n\
  \nShopping and exploring along queen west in the summer (and subsequently taking\
  \ pictures along the infamous graffiti alley).\n\nDining at Burganator or top gun\
  \ in the Kensington market\n\nHaving poutine or fish and chips at st. Lawrence market.\n\
  \nHow do you pronounce the word Poutine?\n\nAccording to this Wiktionary entry (that\
  \ confirms my own pronunciation), it should be /pu.tin/ . In Quebec, where poutine\
  \ is from, its pronounced pou-tin or pu-tsin if you\u2019re French. Both are understood\
  \ but you look silly pronouncing it pou-teen. If you want to pronounce it correctly\
  \ go with pou-tin or pu-tsin\n\nVancouver is commonly known as The Terminal city,\
  \ Vansterdam Hongcouver and Lotus Land\n\nCanadians are known across the globe for\
  \ their hospitality and friendliness. Vancouverites are no exception! Although Vancouverites\
  \ can be stereotyped as yoga wearing-latte sipping-hipsters, living on the west\
  \ coast breeds a certain type of laid back and warm culture.\n\nVancouver is full\
  \ of diversity \u2013 people have immigrated here from China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam,\
  \ the Philippines, Germany, England, Ireland, Portugal, Italy, Ukraine, and Greece.\n\
  \nVancouver also has a large gay community in the downtown West End neighbourhood\
  \ of Davie Village. You\u2019ll know once you\u2019ve arrived when you see the lovely\
  \ rainbow crosswalks on Davie Street. Vancouver is home to one of Canada\u2019s\
  \ largest annual gay pride parades.\n\nTo sum it up, the people in Vancouver are\
  \ friendly, open, and helpful!\n\nWhat Vancouverites do  :\n\nExploring, biking,\
  \ running, or strolling in Stanley Park.\n\nHiking, snowboarding, skiing, or taking\
  \ the train car ride up and down Grouse mountain\n\nTaking a 2-hour drive to explore\
  \ and stay in Whistler and the Olympic village.\n\nDid you know?\n\nIn keeping with\
  \ Vancouver\u2019s Greenest City targets, the Olympic Village uses innovative energy\
  \ efficiency and sustainability systems like solar heating and green roofs.\n\n\
  Watching the gas town fireworks.\n\nHaving the best sushi and Japanese cheesecake\
  \ outside of Japan on Robertson street.\n\n\u201CJust hold on we\u2019re goin\u2019\
  \ home.\u201D Drake"
