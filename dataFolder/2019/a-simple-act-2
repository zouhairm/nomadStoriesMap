Text: "A Simple Act\nMy grandmother always used to say we don\u2019t necessarily have\
  \ to pass through a life-change moment to view something in a new perspective if\
  \ we always keep our minds wide open. I guess I never fully understood that until\
  \ I first traveled abroad and met Dwayne. \nThe clogged streets with humans of every\
  \ kind, busy in-and-outs in buildings and coffee shops in the early mornings of\
  \ New York City surrounded my uncle and I as we walked through the wet cement and\
  \ up the never ending stairs of the subway, just to find myself lost from my only\
  \ relative in the city and in a sea of unknown people. Among those, an ordinary\
  \ citizen of the Big Apple, dark colored skin shining with tattoos in his arm, bright\
  \ orange vest way smaller than it should be and dark green pair of trousers, spending\
  \ his ordinary morning in front the station selling tickets to the Ferry Boat approaches\
  \ me, shook my hand and said \u201CHi, I\u2019m Dwayne. Can I tell you something?\u201D\
  \ \n\nWe as individuals don\u2019t usually give too much importance and attention\
  \ to sellers in packed streets trying to sell their fish to whomever is willing\
  \ to buy it, but that man stood out for me. He had nothing special. However, pehaps\
  \ I was hooked in an overwhelming sense by his simplicity in a city full of fancy\
  \ people. All I had to do was shake his hand back and listen to what he had to say\
  \ to persuade me to buy tickets, and then gracefully thank him but deny it and go\
  \ on my way, like something we are wired to do, something already precipitated.\
  \ \n\n\u201CMy best friend in college is from Brazil.\u201D Dwayne said, nostalgia\
  \ spilling from his eyes and words as he pointed down at my black and white tourist-y\
  \ Rio de Janeiro shirt. Simple as that.\n\nAs my mind processed his sentence I found\
  \ myself in new territory.  My mind fooled me into thinking of the words he was\
  \ going to say \u2013 a \u2018buy this, the price is great\u2019 was expected \u2013\
  \ and all I could reply with was an \u201COh really?\u201D \n\nAnd then the beginning\
  \ of a well-remembered memory of his about college days started. How he met Pablo\
  \ in bar near his campus, in the middle of a fake fight of friends in common with\
  \ the sole purpose to \u2018impress the girl, you know?\u2019. How they became roommates\
  \ and always had the desire to travel to Brazil. How he had to leave college to\
  \ help his sister at home. How sad that made him. How he and Pablo still speak to\
  \ this day. \n\nIt was a simple Tuesday morning in the big city, a 5\u20193\u201D\
  \ girl and a 6\u20194\u201D man talking in the middle of the street was something\
  \ pretty common to see; Nevertheless, there was a sense of confidentiality as we\
  \ talked, as a secret he was holding for so long was being released from deep inside\
  \ him with relief. \n\nEventually I found my uncle and we found our way to the Empire\
  \ State. As we began to walk towards the enourmously tall building, Dwayne smiled\
  \ and said \u201CThank you for listening to me, you made my day.\u201D \n\nI\u2019\
  ve never told anyone about Dwayne and the brief conversation we had. \u201CHow was\
  \ New York?\u201D my friends asked. Questions and answers crossed the room like\
  \ a silly game of ping-pong every time the subject of matter came, and although\
  \ all the buildings, art, culture and food amused me, mine and Dwayne\u2019s exchange\
  \ of thoughts always crossed my mind as I replied with \u201CIt was nothing I was\
  \ expecting\u201D.  Simple as that."
