Text: "Butterflies in my tummy. It's a mix of fear, doubts and excitement at the same\
  \ time... A bit of anxiety and nerves because I didn't prepare this trip,  but I\
  \ think it's much better if life surprises you and usually it is for good. It works\
  \ for me, so why bother trying to plan everything. After all this is a different\
  \ world, so better go with the flow and enjoy with whatever happens. I think this\
  \ way of travelling is more fun \U0001F61B\nI took the bus this morning from Kolkata\
  \ and everything has been delayed since then. Starting from the bus itself which\
  \ it supposed to leave at 7.30am, but instead left at 8.30am.\nIn Petrapol I had\
  \ to get checked my passport to receive the departure stamp... Then walking I crossed\
  \ to Benapole where I wasn't prepared for the visa on arrival. I had read on the\
  \ Internet that I could pay with euros so I didn't even bother in changing money,\
  \ but the officers wanted Indian rupees, dollars or taka. So they allowed me go\
  \ to change money and come back. The man at the counter came with me and another\
  \ gentleman helped me to change a few euros. So sweet!!!! \nFinally I got my visa\
  \ for a month and another man was waiting for me to take another bus to Dhaka. \n\
  We stopped somewhere for food and it was delicious. I had some rice with vegetables\
  \ for 80 taka. A mixed between spicy and sweet, so yummy! And the place was a humble\
  \ restaurant, but the cleanest I have seen in all Indian subcontinent. \nOn the\
  \ bus to Dhaka I could observe the landscape and it was super beautiful... Green\
  \ tropical stunning flora, with many different types of trees everywhere and paddy\
  \ fields of an emerald colour that catch your eye and you can't look away \U0001F60D\
  \ Also everything gets mixed with lakes and backwaters what makes everything even\
  \ more beautiful. I can even see the difference with India, less noise and less\
  \ rubbish... Khulna district surprised me for good \U0001F609\nUps, I fall asleep...\
  \ I opened my eyes and woke up thinking I was on a train barrier. However the bus\
  \ assistant came to me and asked me if I wanted to go to the washroom, so I went\
  \ to the toilet and was thinking that I was dizzy, but for my surprise I was on\
  \ a ferry hahaha. There were people selling fruit and the bus assistant bought me\
  \ an apple and a banana, he even called my contact in Dhaka to make sure I would\
  \ reach safely. After more than one hour on the ferry we crossed the Padma river,\
  \ left the ferry and kept driving towards the capital. \nAt some point we were stuck\
  \ on a traffic jam in a rural area and didn't move for 4 hours. I decide to leave\
  \ the bus and buy some crisps so someone helped with that. When I came back the\
  \ bus assistant was super worried and concerned about my safety. He told me this\
  \ was a village area and anything can happen to me because it's not safe, so he\
  \ asked me to don't leave the bus unless with him. I really appreciate that he was\
  \ trying to help and protect me because I'm his responsibility according to him.\
  \ This is something very touching, same as India... People take care of you so much\
  \ that it's super easy to travel around. Everyone wants to make sure you reach the\
  \ destination without problems and also they want you to have an incredible time\
  \ in their country. They feel honoured that you're visiting them, but between you\
  \ and me: I feel honoured that they are so hospitable and treat me so well. This\
  \ is a priceless gift! Thank you so much :-)\nThis is wonderful. \nI already like\
  \ this place hehe \U0001F600 it is to recover this feeling I had in India before.\
  \ I feel special and blessed that the universe put so many wonderful people on my\
  \ way!!!\nPS. I arrived in Dhaka at 6am \U0001F643"
