Text: "I felt a connection. Instantly. Between you and me. There is this energy, that\
  \ unfolded while I first looked deep.\nDeep down at you, when I was sitting in the\
  \ airplane, seconds before we were about to meet for the very first time.\n\nIf\
  \ I believe in love at first sight?\n\nYou teached me life. Real life. Love. Pain.\
  \ Fear. Everything you could. I bet you to give me all you have for me. And you\
  \ did. I soaked it take it all up.\nWhat you've done to me? More, than I could have\
  \ ever imagined.\n\nNovember: There I was, with my best friend by my side, sitting\
  \ in our Pinterest-looking Van - in Australia.\nWe started with good intentions,\
  \ a big smile, positivity & 500$, never expecting, that everything is going to turn\
  \ out differently.\n\nThe first months felt like a childhood dream. New places,\
  \ new animals, just a whole new world. \nWe learnt surfing, enjoyed life, while\
  \ we waited for Nye to come. There it was. \n2018!\nWhen we returned to our Van\
  \ from the Nye party on 01/01/18 7:00am, we recognized, that our Car-battery ran\
  \ low.\nThat's how we started our year, and that's exactly how it turned out to\
  \ be.\nWe got a new battery and started our adventure, driving south to Melbourne,\
  \ where we stayed 3 weeks in a little surfer-town, called Torquay.\nThis was the\
  \ first time I realized, that I'm absolutely broke. Luckily, we found a farm job\
  \ nearby, where we stayed 4 more weeks, which turned out to be a curse and blessing\
  \ at once. Not an easy job, but mind-opening. We lived with 10 other Malaysian people\
  \ in a house. I love to meet new people and get to know their culture! \nAfter this\
  \ month, we headed down the Great Ocean Road to Adelaide.\nThat's, where absolutely\
  \ everything was changing for me. At this point, I had about 1500$ in my bank-account,\
  \ gained new experiences and already faced some fears. Me and friend were still\
  \ doing fine.... besides these conflicts we had.\nTraveling isn't easy, when you're\
  \ a person, who thinks and feels too much. Things get easily TOO much, but that's\
  \ a part of it.\n\n- Bang - \n\nThere I was, laying on the ground, in the middle\
  \ of the street. In our car, our van, our home. Not realizing, what just happened\
  \ to us.\nOne second, too much. One wrong move. One wrong decision. That's what\
  \ happened. A moment, where I saw death, even if I was far away from it.\nAt this\
  \ point, I couldn't see what's going to happen next. The feeling of loosing control.\
  \ Control of our car, of myself, of my life.\nLuck in bad luck. \nMy friend had\
  \ no issues and I had just a bloody shoulder, which wasn't a big deal. We just needed\
  \ a new car.\nBut for myself, it was more than that. I saw life with new eyes.\n\
  After buying a new 4WD car with a rooftop tent, we moved on. I just couldn't leave\
  \ you at this point. This wasn't the end. Not for us.\nBut for me and my friend?\
  \ \nThe next car breakdown in the outback followed 5 days later. Paying bills &\
  \ bills & bills. Life felt like a bad horror movie.\nAfter finally arriving in Perth...\n\
  I started to feel alive. Fell in love. Worked 2 months with the most beautiful souls\
  \ to get my life together. To get back up. I fought for you.\nMoney has always been\
  \ a problem. And so was she, my soulfriend, my sister. We reached the point, where\
  \ our minds went in different directions.\nIgnoring the fact, that we're not matching\
  \ anymore, only hurting. I'm not sure what it was. If I've done something wrong,\
  \ because... I was truly alive, for the first time. My creativity was flowing, love\
  \ for life rised.\n\nSo I left you with a tiny tear & a small smile. I know this\
  \ is gonna take a while. Until I return.\n\nYou hurt me. You still do. \nI hated\
  \ you. I loved you.\nTimes weren't easy, but you stayed.\nAlways.\nI'll come back,\
  \ that's for sure.\nI miss you. \nI love you.\nI thank you.\n\nAlways feeling Heartsick\
  \ 'cause\nYou're my Soulhome."
