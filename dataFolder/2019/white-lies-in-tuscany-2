Text: "I may have stretched the truth a bit when I wrote to the director of Collezione\
  \ Gori claiming to speak \"near perfect\" Italian, but the chance to spend my summer\
  \ at a sculpture park in the Tuscan countryside was not something I was about to\
  \ miss out on just because I'd been dozing during ITA101. It wasn't like me to falsify,\
  \ I swear, but something told me I would regret it forever if I missed out on this\
  \ chance. By some miracle I was not required to do a video interview and my application\
  \ to spend the summer as the Collection's live-in tour guide and art history intern\
  \ was accepted. I took the supervisor's neglect to Skype me as both as a sign of\
  \ good fortune and as an indication of the slow-paced life I was about to step into.\
  \ A place where video chat and cell phones were eschewed for leather bound books\
  \ and long discussions about the merits of Canaletto and Guardi. This life of cheek\
  \ kisses, sizzling slabs of Tuscan beef, and leather drying in the sun was soon\
  \ to be my reality. \n\nI was collected from the Florence airport by a jovial older\
  \ lady who introduced herself to me as Elena, one of the Gori family's housekeepers.\
  \ We drove in her Fiat through the green and gold countryside as she explained what\
  \ I can only assume was the history of the area in rapid, musical Italian. I answered\
  \ her in small, enthusiastic chirps of \"S\xEC!\" and \"Perch\xE9?\" until jet lag\
  \ overcame me and I nodded off in the passenger seat. When I awoke, we were parked\
  \ in front of a stately mansion which I came to know as the Villa and also as home.\
  \ \n\nNot only did I not speak Italian, but I knew very little about art. I figured\
  \ that if I did not have the language abilities, I had to at least have a working\
  \ knowledge of the task at hand. Consequently, I spent my next few mornings sipping\
  \ espresso out of tiny porcelain cups while cramming my head full of the past three\
  \ hundred or so years of Italian art history. I devoured not only the books Elena\
  \ lent to me, but also the heaping plates of spicy spaghetti she routinely prepared\
  \ while singing Rita Pavone classics in duets and trios with the passing farmhands\
  \ through the kitchen window. \n\nMy afternoons consisted mostly of long walks through\
  \ the sculpture garden: seventy-four acres packed with art, flowing with olive oil\
  \ and wine, and crawling with wild porcupines. I began each self-guided tour by\
  \ staring at a cabin constructed entirely of mirrors. It was so impeccably clean\
  \ that it virtually disappeared into the lush green surrounding it, the mirrors\
  \ creating the illusion that nothing was there at all. I continued my walk through\
  \ a green and white limestone maze meant to mimic the facades of Tuscan churches.\
  \ Later, I pushed aside shoots of bamboo to catch a glimpse of three glittering\
  \ bronze spheres. Next, I admired a collection of clay jugs posed to look like they\
  \ were tumbling off a shelf.  They evoked both the jars used to store olive oil\
  \ that I had seen scattered about the estate and at the same time looked like funeral\
  \ urns. My eyes ate and ate. \n\nDuring these afternoon walks I became the central\
  \ character in a novel written on the folds of my own brain and I started to experience\
  \ some euphoric sort of cabin fever from spending all this time alone with my thoughts.\
  \ I came to the realization that, for the first time in my life, I had encountered\
  \ unadulterated art. I saw it without a museum pamphlet, without a nattering tour\
  \ guide's voice coming through a cheap headset in my ear, and without a gallery's\
  \ whitewashed walls in the background. \n\nAt the end of the week when my supervisor\
  \ came to evaluate my progress I somehow managed to piece together some coherent\
  \ sentence fragments until she blessedly got dragged away to help a Japanese billionaire\
  \ book a private viewing. I sighed with relief as I admired the picturesque vineyard\
  \ backdrop; I decided in the future not to hesitate to tell more little white lies."
