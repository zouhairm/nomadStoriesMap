Text: the world as we know it is not the one we seek to find every time we step out
  of the house on a journey to the unknown. Nature, the world, the people, Life is
  always surprising amazing to say in the least . The  nature of journey is that it's
  never tiring but always inspiring. one such journey that lead me to the unknown
  900kms journey to Kashmir the land of paradise in India. I Had been dreaming about
  going to that place for a very long time and when one such an Opportunity came across
  I just grabbed it and left. Travelling through the highways in the local non AC
  seated, traveling in that bus to the off road Toyota trails to the inside valleys
  of Kashmir the journey was troublesome yet fruitful at the end I came upon the valley
  mountains surrounding me with paddy fields at one side to the range in mountains
  at the far and the horizon every piece of art couldn't be compared to the natural
  beauty Kashmir had to offer at every nook and turn off the road I could see a beautiful
  sight the hand never came upon my eyes I had stay at home stay at one of my known
  acquaintances in Kashmir with fruit of the orchard the Apple itself for morning
  breakfast to a hot cup of tea in the evening with the homegrown coconut cookies
  I never imagined that comfort could be rained in Kashmir for an outsider Kashmir
  offered me huge many loads of surprises and memories to cherish the streams of freshwater
  from underground to the Ice silly ones of the mountain tops I travelled from the
  cool springs to the snow Laden mountain dogs all on a bike with a friend a local
  friend Srinagar was a sports to be visited by menu The tourist but my friend suggested
  that you take of chances with new places I went to Aharbal waterfalls and peer ki
  Gali both these places the wonderful in the district of anantnag.
