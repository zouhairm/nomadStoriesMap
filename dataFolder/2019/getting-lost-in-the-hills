Text: "In 2017, I had lived for over a year in Mumbai, and was still getting used\
  \ to it. The chaos, the noise, the traffic and small cramped up apartments. Not\
  \ to mention, getting used to the long working hours and even getting used to myself\
  \ in a phase in my life where I'm trying to build a career. But something was missing,\
  \ and I needed to do something to make that better. Which is when I booked myself\
  \ a solo trip to Bali to celebrate my 24th birthday.  2018 came along and nothing\
  \ much had changed. The chaos just kept growing outside and inside me. I was still\
  \ desperately to figure my life out. That Bali birthday had helped me rejuvenate\
  \ in a new way and that is when I had decided to travel every birthday. But with\
  \ work pressure and crazy schedules I just couldn\u2019t plan a longer trip in time\
  \ for my 25th birthday. \n\nWhich felt worse because, turning 25 was no joke. We\
  \ all have a plan that we try to follow through, but life doesn\u2019t wait. I was\
  \ not excited about this birthday, especially since it was one that was supposed\
  \ to be a landmark! I'm scared to think about myself in a real mid-life crisis,\
  \ because what I felt that time not able to plan my birthday trip was pretty much\
  \ a quarter life crisis to me. That is when I called up my best friend and said\
  \ that whatever happens, she is joining me on my birthday trip. \n\nAfter a lot\
  \ of back and forth on which place to visit, we finally settled on Himachal Pradesh.\
  \ A cooler climate in the peak of Indian summer was indeed tempting. Dalhousie was\
  \ a hill station I had heard a lot about and had always wanted to visit. So, we\
  \ booked those tickets. I\u2019ll be honest, after booking those tickets and the\
  \ hostel I started having doubts about the hill station. No pictures that I saw\
  \ on Instagram from what others were posting looked appealing enough. But you know\
  \ what\u2019s well when you visit a place without having too many expectations?\
  \ You are pleasantly surprised and taken aback by the beauty it has to offer. When\
  \ we reached our hostel in Dalhousie it was like we were surrounded by a Microsoft\
  \ wallpaper \u2013 as my friend called it. Deodar trees all around and snow- capped\
  \ mountains in the distant view. The weather was perfect, with a little chill to\
  \ it and sunny enough for us to get some nice photos out.\n\nThat day all we did\
  \ was walk from our hostel to the city centre, Gandhi Chowk, which was about 4km\
  \ away. The route wasn\u2019t  a boring one, the hills around me, the distant snowcapped\
  \ peaks that I could occasionally spot and the thick forests that whispered stories\
  \ and the little school kids who strolled along the way. Each and every element\
  \ made it special to me.\n\nThe Chowk itself took us not more than 20 minutes to\
  \ explore. It\u2019s a tiny circle. That\u2019s when we decided to walk another\
  \ 5km to a waterfall called \u2018Panchpula\u2019. The road and the walk were pleasant\
  \ and didn\u2019t feel tiring at that point. Once we reached \u2018Panchpula\u2019\
  \ and climbed the stairs the fatigue (at least for me) started to set in. After\
  \ that little hike I did hope to see some gushing water. Now, I wasn\u2019t expecting\
  \ Niagara falls but what we saw was like someone forgot to turn off the knob of\
  \ a tap in a washroom. Of course, since we did take effort to reach here, we decided\
  \ to sit there with a cup of coffee and a plate or two of Maggi (instant noodles).\
  \ And soon we didn't mind the view. It was a good start.\n \nAs I snuck into my\
  \ bed that night, I was finally started feeling excited about the trip. About the\
  \ next few days, the Dainkund Valley trek we were going on the next day (which turned\
  \ out to be so beautiful that I think I even cried at a point) and somehow even\
  \ about that 25th birthday. \nThe phrase \u2018lifting of spirit\u2019? I finally\
  \ understood what it meant."
