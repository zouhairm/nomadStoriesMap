Text: "I was sitting on a bus from the airport taking me to downtown terminal of Damascus.\
  \ \n\nI remember being the only foreign face in a full packed bus. I was seated\
  \ facing towards the passengers.  It was a half hour awkward bus ride with passengers\
  \ staring at me. \n\n\nDamascus\n\nI spent few days in Damascus -capital city to\
  \ Syria, and made myself new friends at a local tea house. Syrian men are generally\
  \ friendly and easy to approach, while the women are obviously keeping their distance\
  \ as perhaps it is what is more acceptable.\n\nI offered many prayers  at the grandeur\
  \ Ummayad Mosque, a very impressive ancient massive mosque located in the old town\
  \ part of Damascus. After prayers i just couldn't resist myself taking photos of\
  \ its interior, chandeliers, fabulous wall painting ornament on the facade of it's\
  \ main entrance gate. Also Minarets standing tall and elegant againts the background\
  \ of clear blue sky. \n\nLike a local, I visits this hundreds years old Zouk (market)\
  \ for my daily needs.  Everytime i stepped my feet into the main gate, i feel like\
  \ i have just been thrown out of a time machine and taken back to a golden period\
  \ of Salahuddin.\n\nIt was an amazing experience to see all those shops, tea corners,\
  \ main gate iron huge doors, and various merchandises displayed are of exactly the\
  \ same things with what they had few hundred years back -perhaps a thousand years\
  \ ago. All of a sudden I was in a different time zone, not only of a different country.\n\
  \nPeople are generally friendly. The men are not shy expressing their affections\
  \ towards their male friends.\nThey hug and kiss you, They would hold your hand\
  \ or throw their arms around your shoulder while walking or talking. They would\
  \ shower you with kisses on the cheeks before parting with you. No matter how tempting\
  \ this might sound, never expect these gestures from the women if you are a man.\
  \  \n  \n\nAleppo\n\nI stayed longer in Aleppo -Syria's second biggest city.\n\n\
  I offered my daily prayers and Friday prayers at the Aleppo Ummayad Mosque -which\
  \ is almost identical to the one in Damascus. Its grandeur and majestic architecture\
  \ never fails to amaze me.\n\nDetermined to act like a local, I religiously visits\
  \ Zouk -the market.  Again, I let myself  submerged into the wonders of the ancient\
  \ period while strolling under those domes from the Zouk's front gate to the end\
  \ gate.\n\nAt the end of the gate, the path led me to a handsome citadel standing\
  \ tall and looking so dignified. It was only a bridge away.\n\nI entered the massive\
  \ wooden and iron gate of the Citadel, felt like being pulled back into medieval\
  \ dreams. Ruins of houses inside fascinated me.\n\nI climbed to one of its observatory\
  \ towers and find a window to sit next to. \nI looked out of the window and found\
  \ my self stunned by a breathtaking view of Aleppo city from the heighest point\
  \ of this region. \n\nI made friends during my stay in Aleppo Most I met in the\
  \ mosques after daily prayers. They are affectionate and warm. I befriended with\
  \ a friendly fruit juice street vendor whose his 12 years old son is always happy\
  \ seeing me. I am also friend to an old man with the cart of grilled corns whose\
  \ face always wearing sincere fatherly comforting smiles.\n\nSoul,rather than place.\
  \  \n\nA year after my visit to Syria, a civil war broke. For months I have constantly\
  \ received devastating news from friends.\n\nMany of those places i have visited\
  \ are either partially or completely demolished, flattened to the ground. \n\nFriends\
  \ I made are either missing, fleeing, dying, or deceased. Mostly missing. \n\nDespite\
  \ the horror of the war, i holds sweetest memories of Syria inside my heart. \n\n\
  I did not travel to Syria to entertain myself with sceneries or gorgeous architectural\
  \ structures. I visited Syria to be amazed by its people and their culture. \n\n\
  The war might have destroyed buildings,  places, and eliminated a generation. But\
  \ the same war can never destroy its soul. \n\nI do not fall in love to places,\
  \ I fall in love to its people -which is the soul of the place."
