Text: "When I was younger, I spent a summer in Nova Scotia, in a little cottage on\
  \ the Bay of Fundy, near where my mother grew up.\nThe Bay of Fundy is one of the\
  \ most magnificent places on earth. At high tide, the water laps at the front lawns\
  \ of bayside cottages, leaks up into the grass. At low tide, the beaches can be\
  \ seen for miles\u2014red sand, bubbling with the exhales of concealed clams, spotted\
  \ black with tiny snails.\nI\u2019m a lifeguard now, but when I was younger, I was\
  \ a terrible swimmer. I was allergic to chlorine, and in landlocked Illinois, that\
  \ meant that I couldn\u2019t take swimming lessons. When I had the chance to access\
  \ the salt water of the Bay, it was deemed too dangerous for an inexperienced swimmer\
  \ such as myself. \nDespite my lack of aquatic skills, I was drawn to the ocean.\
  \ I would wade in to my knees at higher tides, and when the tides went out, my family\
  \ and I would just walk, miles into the ocean. I remember it clearly\u2014our terrier\u2019\
  s fur, thick with red sand. I, stepping delicately, desperate not to crush the snails,\
  \ and yet\u2014completely free. Just red sand, and sky, and a tide that would eventually\
  \ chase us back to shore.\nLobster rolls for dinner, a sun that didn\u2019t set\
  \ until ten PM, the smell of saltwater\u2014that was my summer. I wouldn\u2019t\
  \ have had it any other way.\nI haven\u2019t gone back to Nova Scotia in a long\
  \ time. I go to school in Minnesota, and when I leave, its to visit my hometown,\
  \ in Illinois. As clich\xE9 as it sounds, I still feel the eastward tug towards\
  \ the bay. I joke that its because I\u2019m a Pisces. I think that it\u2019s something\
  \ more than that.\nOne of my favorite songs is called Land Locked Blues, written\
  \ by Conor Oberst, of the band Bright Eyes.  In it, Oberst writes: \u201CI found\
  \ a liquid cure / for my landlocked blues\u201D. \nHe wrote that in his earlier\
  \ days, when he lived in Omaha. I understand, I think. Sometimes, the dullness\u2014\
  the dryness\u2014of the Midwest is inescapable. Other times, not so much."
