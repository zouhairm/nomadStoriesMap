Text: "\u201CMadam, my delivery boy is waiting at the Amritsar Junction with your\
  \ dinner. When is your train arriving there?\u201D asked the restaurant owner for\
  \ the third time. If nothing else, I could hear the plain exasperation in his voice\
  \ along with the rumble coming from my stomach.\nIt was 9:38 pm, and I was stuck\
  \ at Verka Junction since the last hour. My train was rerouted and now it was supposed\
  \ to halt at Amritsar rather than Ambala, which was my final destination. I had\
  \ ordered food online, but the extra-long halt at Verka ruined both; my food and\
  \ my mood.\nThe ruckus created by my tummy was already too much for me to think\
  \ straight now, add the awkwardness of salivating at others\u2019 food to it. Hence,\
  \ I googled the distance between my location and Amritsar city and got down at Verka.\
  \ A quick search on Uber showed no service in this town, 15 km distant from Amritsar.\n\
  I started looking out for other available method of commutes. By now it was 10:15\
  \ pm and panic began to surface.\nIt wasn\u2019t late as per Metro life, but Verka\
  \ was a different story altogether. I later came to know the market here shuts down\
  \ by eight at night mostly.\nNow hunger had morphed into regret. \u201CYou were\
  \ better off in the train!\u201D scolded my timid side.\nSuddenly loud Punjabi music\
  \ broke my regretful chain of thoughts. I squinted my eyes to see a 'Tempo' heading\
  \ in my direction. In case you are wondering, 'Tempos' in India are bigger versions\
  \ of auto rickshaws; black in color, rusty and very old, seat approximately twelve\
  \ people where two mostly hang at the back and play local music high on bass.\n\
  Hiding my glee, I asked the driver if he would drop me at the Amritsar Bus Stand.\
  \ He nodded, and we hit the road in a matter of seconds. The 'Tempo' dropped me\
  \ off at the bus stand after making me endure 30 minutes of ear-blasting Punjabi\
  \ songs.\nThe time now was 11 pm, and I had missed the last bus. The next one was\
  \ at five in the morning.\nI had an ample amount of time to waste now, and hunger\
  \ resurfaced with full blast. I checked in to a 'dhaba' opposite the bus stand and\
  \ ordered \u2018Punjabi Thali.\u2019 Food does wonders to an empty stomach and a\
  \ confused mind. \nWondering what to do at such an ungodly hour I dragged my stroller\
  \ to a nearby hotel. Tired and a little scared I was about to ask for a room when\
  \ my eyes fell on a framed picture of Sri Harmandir Sahib aka The Golden Temple\
  \ and an idea formulated. \u201CCould you please help me with a taxi service to\
  \ here?\" I quickly said, pointing towards the wall behind the receptionist.\nAfter\
  \ 20 minutes of smacking my head for not getting this idea earlier, I was sitting\
  \ in a taxi heading to the renowned Golden Temple of Amritsar. Outside the Gurudwara,\
  \ the night was still young. I found people enjoying the eateries. I zigzagged my\
  \ way inside and what I witnessed took my breath away.\nThere stood the glistening\
  \ abode of tranquility and mystique surrounded by a sacred pool and group of buildings.\
  \ The golden reflection in the pool felt like gold dust sprinkled over water.\n\
  Mesmerized beyond words, I dropped everything and sat. The tranquil atmosphere calmed\
  \ me but turned on my subconscious.\nIt started revisiting tonight\u2019s events\
  \ and I realized that I had taken a leap of faith back at Verka. The decision was\
  \ both hasty and reckless. I racked my brain repeatedly over what made me do it.\n\
  It was the faith; I realized then that kept me going when stranded in a strange\
  \ town in the middle of the night, it was faith that I never lost the hold of and\
  \ it was pure faith that brought me here, to this haven. Now that I was here, I\
  \ wasn\u2019t in a hurry. With dissolving self-doubts, I was more in harmony with\
  \ the place. Ambala can wait for now, as I had a night of peace and safety to relish."
