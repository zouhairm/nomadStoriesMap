Text: "For some people, trying new foods or visiting internationally-renowned museums\
  \ is how they explore new places. For me, it's running \u2013\u2013 it's always\
  \ been putting on a pair of sneakers in a new city or country \u2013\u2013 and jogging\
  \ as far as I can. Closing my Google Maps app. Maybe turning on a running app solely\
  \ to track my distance. I play a game with myself, by remembering landmarks, taking\
  \ pictures, identifying hidden paths and trails \u2013\u2013\_to become fully acquainted\
  \ with a new place. There's no better way for me to feel like an observer of my\
  \ surroundings, without succumbing to the tourist inclination of planning your sightseeing\
  \ ahead. \n\nS\xE3o Jorge is a lush, field-full island located in the Azores islands\
  \ off the coast of Portugal. I want to run the coasts of volcanic rock, meander\
  \ my way into the inner neighborhoods, like Nort\xE9 Pequeno, a northern village\
  \ home to S\xE3o Jorge's native cheese. In fact, the island's economy thrives on\
  \ its cheese! And who doesn't love to snack on some cheese after a long run? \n\n\
  My plan is to run the island top to bottom: 32 miles, in a series of at least a\
  \ few days, possibly Airbnb-ing at least twice in between. Of course a light backpack\
  \ will be essential. I'm interested in covering this travel story as a true expedition\
  \ afoot, capturing moments and intimate portraits of the island's scenery throughout\
  \ my hilly jog. What makes S\xE3o Jorge so unique as a running destination is that\
  \ it's estimated that twice as many cows live on the island as there are people.\
  \ There are only about 9,000 people on the island, anyway. (So no asking inhabitants\
  \ for directions, unless cows can help.) I plan to run the green landscapes called\
  \ \"Fajas\" and the steep, rugged cliffs along the coast. \n\nI'm interested in\
  \ telling this story to 1) encourage more tourists and travelers to make exercise\
  \ an integral part of their vacations, and 2) to further encourage tourists to travel\
  \ to remote islands where cars are seldom used. Especially in isolated regions that\
  \ heavily rely on their own resources and modes of transportation \u2013\u2013 it's\
  \ important to understand how people navigate around the world. I think S\xE3o Jorge\
  \ offers that perspective because of its topography, too. It's not an easy path\
  \ or trail to maneuver, but its people find a way. Through my run, I'll tell those\
  \ stories. And hopefully inspire people to pack lightly, with just a pair of running\
  \ sneakers, too."
