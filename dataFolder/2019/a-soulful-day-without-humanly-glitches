Text: "So I\u2019ll start my travel story by telling something about my personality.\
  \ I am an introvert, a typical introvert I would say. I don\u2019t like going out\
  \ too often, meeting new people and you know creating a bond with the world outside.\
  \ \nIt all started when one day my family was planning for a trip to a hilltop.\
  \ As usual I was least interested so I clearly told them that I won\u2019t be joining\
  \ them. I guess at some point of time you all have experienced this too, I mean\
  \ when we don\u2019t have any plans for a particular thing and at the end we are\
  \ walking on the same road with others haha. The same happened with me, I had no\
  \ plan to go to that trip but at the end my family convinced me forcefully and thus\
  \ I agreed to go with them.\nNow the real experience starts from here. We were going\
  \ to a hill top in North India and the moment we reached the destination, we parked\
  \ our car and went out of it. I looked all around and the sky was wide and beautiful;\
  \ all blue with flowy clouds with wind constantly blowing. I started going forward\
  \ on my own and as I was moving up, there was an untold reason of happiness. I mean,\
  \ I didn\u2019t know why I was smiling and feeling relaxed. Then when I went up\
  \ at the top, there I just stood at one place noticing everything around me. The\
  \ wind was blowing so fast constantly, open sky and my smiling face. For the first\
  \ time I realized what being in an unknown beautiful place felt like. For people\
  \ who have never experienced this; I request all of you to try going somewhere.\
  \ Doesn\u2019t matter which place but an unknown place and your own company. \n\
  You have so many emotions bundled in a travel experience. Like feeling your self\
  \ identity, questioning materialism in life, meeting new people and so many soulful\
  \ elements!  I experienced all of it undoubtedly even when I never wanter to go\
  \ to a trip but look how wrong was my perception! So if you want to take a break\
  \ from materialism and if you want to have soulful experiences then just travel!\
  \ Go to an unknown place and have soulful experiences!\nCheers!"
