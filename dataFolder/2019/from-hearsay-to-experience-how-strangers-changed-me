Text: "My eyes stung from the beads of sweat dripping from my brow. I rested underneath\
  \ one of the 15,000 trees of Retiro park, grateful for its shade from the oppressive\
  \ midday Madrid sun. I positioned myself for people watching, a clear view of the\
  \ bronze and marble King Alfonso XII monument standing 30m high and flanked by columns\
  \ totalling 86m in length. I was entertained by tourists striking poses for selfies\
  \ on the boardwalk of the man-made lake thronged with merry row-boaters. The liveliness\
  \ of children squealing in delight from bike chases was a stark contrast to my nostalgic\
  \ mood. I considered that I would be leaving Spain, a country that had nested in\
  \ the chambers of my heart, in just two days. It had been easy to become enamored\
  \ by the passion-rich culture and barrios, discovering tabernas housing fierce flamenco\
  \ dancers, winding streets showcasing eclectic Bohemian tapestries, and centuries\
  \ of history visibly displayed in city plazas. All of this I had expected. What\
  \ truly left me in awe were interactions with the many strangers who went out of\
  \ their way to genuinely connect with and help me, their generous and welcoming\
  \ nature evident. \n\n     As I savored each bite of a succulent orange, my mind\
  \ slipped away to the balding professor I met on Valencia\u2019s Malvarrosa beach.\
  \ He offered me fresh melon for no reason whilst bronzing in the sand. The unexpected\
  \ offering left me casually assessing my belongings, wary of his motives. But after\
  \ conversing and him animatedly exclaiming, \u201CAh! You are American!\u201D, I\
  \ realized he was simply eager to practice English with me. He then walked me to\
  \ the bus stop, giving me the exact change I needed without expectations of anything\
  \ in return. \n\n     Bus stop. My mind transitioned to the white-haired Catalu\xF1\
  an woman I met the week before. She sweetly observed me with her wrinkled, worried,\
  \ but curious squinting eyes as I tried to make sense of the Barcelona bus maps.\
  \ After a while she approached me, \"Necesita ayuda?\" She asked. I obliged as she\
  \ rapidly explained in Spanish which buses I should take. She gave me an expectant\
  \ look when she was finished as if to say, \"There, all clear now?\". I laughed\
  \ because I had no idea what she had just told me, but was so stricken with appreciation\
  \ for her loving and helpful nature that I nodded my head yes. We took seats on\
  \ opposite ends of the arriving bus. I shot her one last smile but was surprised\
  \ to find her looking at me with a confused and defeated look on her face. \"Guess\
  \ I took the wrong bus\", I sighed to myself with a crooked smile, and acquiesced\
  \ to wherever the road took me for the time being. \n\n     My daydream was interrupted\
  \ by a street musician nearby plucking each spanish guitar string with purpose to\
  \ produce Armik\u2019s intricate \u201CTango Flamenco\u201D melody. I recalled the\
  \ friendly Argentinian family of three that I met in Sol, who invited me to walk\
  \ the bustling streets in search of the perfect churro. \n\n     Churros. I snapped\
  \ upright remembering my plans to meet a new friend for churros. I made my way to\
  \ a park exit, noticing the many couples scattered on the grass, lazily snuggling\
  \ each other in commonplace displays of affection. I had an affinity and respect\
  \ for the freedom and openness of Spanish culture, a contrast to my conservative\
  \ upbringing. Before exiting the park, I stopped to admire the Statue of the Fallen\
  \ Angel sitting 666m above sea level, the only sculpture dedicated to the devil.\
  \ I studied the forsaken look on his face, cast from the heavens with outstretched\
  \ wings. It occurred to me that that even he was probably once blessed with the\
  \ pure heart of an angel. \n\n     Initially, I arrived in Spain riddled with fears\
  \ that people placed in my head or from incidents I read about when researching\
  \ the dangers of traveling, especially as a female alone. I left the park transformed\
  \ with this thought: in a world where acts of generosity and kindness often get\
  \ buried under stories of violence, despair, and injustices, it is comforting and\
  \ empowering to be certain that at the heart of humanity, overwhelmingly, is love."
