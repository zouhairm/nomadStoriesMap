Text: "As an anxiety-ridden human, traveling (especially on a plane) seems very daunting,\
  \ but thankfully the longing won over my fear. I think it has to do with control;\
  \ in a car I much rather be the driver than the passenger, I feel a lot calmer,\
  \ but the chances of being the pilot to an International flight seemed slim. So\
  \ I had to accept the fact that to see the world one must take a leap of faith in\
  \ what is generally known as the safest way to travel, I luckily had friend with\
  \ me as my travel companion, I didn\u2019t have to take these first steps alone,\
  \ I hope one day I'll be able to. We made plans for my first real trip in a long\
  \ time, the best option was a one hour plane ride, four days and a backpack to the\
  \ San Francisco bay. \nThe big day arrived, I barely slept the night before, the\
  \ idea of traveling seemed so impossible, I don\u2019t really know why; for me traveling\
  \ was for characters in movies and books. It wasn\u2019t until I saw a few of my\
  \ close friends go, that it seemed something attainable, my instagram and facebook\
  \ feed would be filled with pictures of their adventures, I would get so jealous\
  \ until I gave it a second thought and realized that this was because they worked\
  \ hard and sacrificed nights out, resisted material things to get what they wanted.\
  \ My friends are \u2018doers\u2019 I\u2019ve been much more of a \u2018sayer\u2019\
  , I always talked of the things I want to do but rarely did them. I had wake up\
  \ and say to myself that if I wanted to explore the castles of Scotland or walk\
  \ through the catacombs of Paris or visit Venice before it sinks, I had to put my\
  \ feet on the ground and start saving and planning. \nThe most nerve-raking thing\
  \ is not knowing what to expect and as I got to the airport my inner monologue was\
  \ trying to clam my nerves down and follow some of the advice I was given: drink\
  \ water not coffee (because I would start shaking); take Dramamine so I don\u2019\
  t get dizzy; and download something on Netflix to watch on the plane. I was surprised\
  \ to be more relaxed than I anticipated, that was until I stepped on-board, I could\
  \ feel how light and fidgety it was, all the way to my seat it felt like I was walking\
  \ the plank of a pirate ship. I sat down and saw the emergency pamphlet, I grabbed\
  \ it and read it fiercely; I made sure my life jacket was under my seat where it\
  \ should be, I checked where the exits were, where the inflatable life rafts were\
  \ and when the instructional video started I hanged on every word. \nIt\u2019s funny\
  \ how memories work, as I try to remember the first ascent I just remember feeling\
  \ pushed into my seat like an astronaut and squeezing my friend's hand; I felt a\
  \ great amount of pressure in my head, it felt like my brain wanted to crawl of\
  \ my head and feeling my ears pop. When it was over I was feeling a little naturally\
  \ high from the fear and adrenaline, I looked outside the window and we were in\
  \ the sky, it may be a clich\xE9 but it was so beautiful, we see the sky everyday\
  \ but up there especially on that sunny day, it was incredible; being in the clouds\
  \ was the most relaxing part, it was like a rollercoaster, the anticipation is what\
  \ kills me; so for the next hour I listened to music and admired the sky. Usually\
  \ I\u2019m pretty hard on myself of the things I haven\u2019t done or the place\
  \ where I should be in life, but I felt so proud to achieve this, to some it may\
  \ seem seem something so mundane but for me it was the opening to what I\u2019ve\
  \ always wanted to do. The descent stared into the Bay Area and I was so exited,\
  \ I almost threw up."
