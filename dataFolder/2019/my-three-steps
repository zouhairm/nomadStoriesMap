Text: "The best reiforcement for the search, the biggest surprises provider and the\
  \ greatest knowledge acquisition booster is the unknown. There's nothing more incredible\
  \ than this: the unknown estimulates the knowledge.\nDo a leap means that the first\
  \ step is already done: the search for the information. Now, the next step: the\
  \ acquisition of information. And, finally, the last step: the transformer knowledge.\
  \ That's the leap for the exploration, the leap into the unknown.\nSo, that was\
  \ my first step: the search for information. The year was 2005, december, and there\
  \ I was, a kid with her mother arriving two cities: S\xE3o Jo\xE3o Del Rey and Tiradentes.\
  \ Until that moment, I just heard and read about those places, and I allways thought\
  \ that the names were spetacular, even the pronunciation are satistactory.\nA few\
  \ times before the trip, I searched about them in brazilian historial books and\
  \ I saw pictures of the churches and streets. Beautiful, but, didn't make me feel\
  \ that intense sentiment.\nThe better way to learn is with practice, creativity\
  \ needs incentive. This brings me to the second step: the acquisition of information.\
  \ I was finally in S\xE3o Jo\xE3o Del Rey, but I didn't have much time in that exactly\
  \ moment, because I needed to board a locomotive that we call \"maria-fuma\xE7a\"\
  . According the ticket, I was late. My destination: Tiradentes. Fourty minutes appreciating\
  \ the view by the locomotive's window, but, it looked so fast that I thought it\
  \ was just ten. The locomotive smoke, the horizon view, the whistle sound... Wow,\
  \ I already was in Tiradentes.\nEveryone who goes to that city believes to be in\
  \ the sixteenth century: train station, wagons, stone roads, houses in an old style,\
  \ marketers on the streets selling condiments... To walk by all that and try to\
  \ capture all of this content is hard. So many voices at the same time, but all\
  \ saying the same thing: \"Welcome! That's what we have to give you!\"\nI was pulled\
  \ by a sound of crashing crystals. There's nothing more beautiful than a crystal\
  \ placed against the sunlight. I founded the oasis: a crystal shop, shining, flickering...\
  \ That's why I collect crystals today, I guess. I could spend all my days there.\n\
  Inside the houses, sacred wooden sculptures, cheetah fabrics, the smell of coffe...\
  \ coffe... God! Delightful... But, I should go. I needed. \nAbboard the maria-fuma\xE7\
  a, I was back in S\xE3o Jo\xE3o Del Rey, and, obviously impressed. A striking number\
  \ of churches, so many of them, everywhere. The streets, the public squares, the\
  \ people... It shocked me. Even the ice cream becomes more yummy in that city. I\
  \ never forget this. It was my last act there.\nThirteen years later, I was back.\
  \ This time, to revive all those feelings. I did all again, touching every single\
  \ thing, looking at the people in the train station, puting my hands outside the\
  \ window, walking on the stone roads... and the churches...\nAnd I finally saw me\
  \ in the last step: the transformer knowledge. Yes, I knew those places, I knew\
  \ the streets. I was in home. Everything was familiar, It just wasn't the unknown\
  \ anymore. My artistic feelings were overflowing, my vision was sharper, my feet\
  \ more sensitive. I was transformed! I did my own leap. \nTo travel is to be the\
  \ author if many histories, is to be part of many cultures, and became the interlocutor\
  \ of them. That's what this leap did to me. And that famous smell of coffe... Well...\
  \ Made me by a coffe scent later."
