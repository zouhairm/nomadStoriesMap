Text: "It was August, and it was a warm night in Denver. I was sitting on my balcony\
  \  with my friend Fletcher sitting next to me. The question on the table was a simple\
  \ one: why was I not in Colombia at that particular moment? You see, I was supposed\
  \ to be. At that point, I was supposed to be in Medellin, and a couple days away\
  \ from flying to Ecuador. But instead, I had changed flights a number of times to\
  \ avoid it, and was staring down an increasing expense bill, and the disappointment\
  \ I felt in myself in having not done this. So why was I not in Colombia? \n\nAnxiety.\
  \ Depression. Nerves. Call it what you want. It\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled\
  \ with for a long time, and in this case, it got the best of me. I had spent three\
  \ days of solitude in my apartment until Fletcher texted me and said he hoped I\
  \ was in Colombia. I responded I wasn\u2019t, and he came over. We talked it through,\
  \ and I explained the anxiety that drove me to change plans. It had nothing to do\
  \ with the destination, but merely with myself. And I knew that, and was more frustrated\
  \ by that than anything else. So we talked for a long time, and a few hours later,\
  \ changed my tickets once again to send me directly to Ecuador, and ultimately,\
  \ to a place I had been dreaming of \u2013 the Galapagos Islands. \n\nI\u2019m not\
  \ afraid to fly or to wander cities by myself or to do any number of things. But\
  \ my nerves were frayed, chewed down to their ends by the creeping nature of my\
  \ anxiety. However, with that one long discussion and hours of facing myself down,\
  \ I made my way to Denver International Airport, and began the journey to the Galapagos.\
  \ \n\nSee, I had booked myself a four day cruise on a small vessel at the last minute\
  \ for a ridiculously low rate, and while I had already run up extra costs on myself\
  \ through my nerve-driven flight changes, I couldn\u2019t see myself not doing it.\
  \ That was the biggest thing that hit me. I had struggled seeing myself do things,\
  \ as I have in the past, but as soon as I dive into them, all of that fades. It\u2019\
  s what has made traveling alone immensely rewarding, as it serves as a powerful\
  \ reminder that my anxiety may be there, but I\u2019m capable of staring it down\
  \ and having wonderful and powerful experiences. \n\nFletcher had dropped me off\
  \ at the train, and as it rattled down the tracks towards DIA, my mind raced and\
  \ even tried to pull myself towards convincing myself that I should not be doing\
  \ this. I closed my eyes. I breathed. I listened to the world whip past the window.\
  \ And then I moved. First, off the train. Through security. Into the terminal. Onto\
  \ the plane. And then off the plane into the Fort Lauderdale airport. And again,\
  \ through security, through check-in, into the terminal, and onto the plane to Guayaquil,\
  \ where I spent one night before waking early to board my flight to Isla Baltra.\
  \ \n\nAt this point, my anxiety was in check. My mind was calmer. And I was happy\
  \ to be someplace new. To walk through the Guayaquil airport to the counter where\
  \ a secondary inspection of your luggage occurs prior to departing for the Galapagos.\
  \ I was eager to spend four days on a boat, exploring islands that are far from\
  \ the world most of us inhabit, and that many people never get to see or experience\
  \ in their lifetime. I was present. And as we touched down at the airport on Isla\
  \ Baltra, and my eyes took in the beauty and wonder that lay before me, I found\
  \ myself at peace. I was ready to explore and open to everything that this magical\
  \ place had to offer. \n\nThere is much more to this story. From sea turtles to\
  \ penguins to the only brewery in the Galapagos, there is more to tell. However,\
  \ as wonderful as that experience is to tell, it is almost more important to tell\
  \ of the challenge I faced in taking that first step."
