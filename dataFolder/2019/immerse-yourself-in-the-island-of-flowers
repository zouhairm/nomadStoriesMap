Text: "Yo. Not really formal, right ? Well, whatever. Because let's be open-minded\
  \ enough to discover things, together. Have you ever heard about the island of flowers\
  \ ? Me neither, until I recently discovered it. And also as did Victor Hugo in the\
  \ late 19th century. Even better ! Then as the vast differences existing bewteen\
  \ his writing style and the one of Ernest Hemingway, also huge differences emanate\
  \ from our island of flowers compared to the rest of the world. Let me tell you\
  \ why. \n\n \nA Natural Harmonization \n\nWho said that the notion of safety was\
  \ obviously opposed to the one of adventure ? Hopefully no one especially if being\
  \ adventurous means to you, as to me, being instinctively curious. Therefore your\
  \ intuition might incite you to take this specific road or to taste this yummy-looking\
  \ food instead of some touristic deals. In our unknown island, while my instinct\
  \ was profoundly stimulated by an immense variety of colours and delicious smells\
  \ from flowers almost everywhere around me ; I also could rely on the micro-climate\
  \ of the place. Thus, I deeply felt a kind of natural harmonisation between the\
  \ inhabitants' style of living and the landscapes themselves. Indeed, it was entirely\
  \ possible to walk along the beach while admiring the seagulls' airshow and not\
  \ stressed out at all about the door of the house or of the car, not being locked.\
  \ Yay, really guys. The flowers could tell you this as well. From the white and\
  \ purple bouquets of agapanthus in autumn, to the resisting palmtrees in winter,\
  \ and the softly pink\u2019s tulips in spring until some lights spread by the daffodils\u2019\
  \ profound yellow in summer; you could learn how to naturally metamorphose, grow\
  \ or just change along the four seasons. What else then? \n\n\nA Variety of Healthy\
  \ Activities \n\n\xAB\_ Youth\_ \xBB is not a timeless effect on the person. But\
  \ rather, I honestly conceive it as reflecting a healthy state of mind. And as any\
  \ other muscles, your brain requires to practice in order to perform actively. Then,\
  \ plenty of options to ensure this goal are available in the island. What about\
  \ participating into creative workshops\_? Or what about planning a yoga session\
  \ or a jazz concert\_? In the countryside\_? Sounds inspiring, let\u2019s do this\_\
  ! Oh, but maybe you would like to visit Judith Qu\xE9r\xE9e's Garden before, which\
  \ contains over 2,000 plants ? Super. I might instead go chase the winds\u2019 blowing\
  \ words to discover things. Again, again. Put your flip-flops\u2019 and hop! Let\u2019\
  s grab one of the locally-made milky ice-cream somewhere and talk with peoples around,\
  \ who mainly speak English, Polish and Spanish, by the way. What else then? \n\n\
  \nWell, you can come living and sharing nice moments at the now revealed, Jersey\
  \ Channel Island of the United Kingdom. Just don\u2019t forget to always keep a\
  \ suncream and an umbrella with you, at the same time. For real, at the same time?\
  \ Yeah I know, it\u2019s kind of incredible but useful, believe me. See U Soon !"
