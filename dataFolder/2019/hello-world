Text: "It is amazing how the birth of a new life happens. A germ is literally formed\
  \ from nothing. It grows, internal organs appear, heart, muscles, spine, arms and\
  \ legs appear. Week 38 - baby is preparing for independent living and counting the\
  \ days until birth.\nHello World! - exclaimed the newborn, fixing his greeting to\
  \ the world by crying.\nSomewhere nearby hospital the melody from the song \u201C\
  John Legend - All of Me\u201D played.\nIt is said that the brain activity of a newborn\
  \ exceeds the activity of an adult formed person, therefore, in fact, babies understand\
  \ and analyze everything before they begin to speak, however, they cannot share\
  \ what they see, cannot say.\nHow light, how unusually to be here \u2014 the newborn\
  \ was amazed to himself \u2014 everything looks so new and not yet known to me,\
  \ and what smells. He felt the sweet aromas interspersed with something that ruffled\
  \ his eyes. He felt that he was gradually adapting to the space in which he appeared,\
  \ gradually connecting each of his five senses - smell, sight, hearing, taste and\
  \ touch. He touched a man in a medical gown. The movements were awkward, but significant,\
  \ because these were the first movements towards a new life.\nThe baby was overwhelmed\
  \ with indescribable delight, mixed with the fear of the unknown world, which at\
  \ the same time was so close - just stretch out a tiny handle, but at the same time\
  \ divide the gap between them from a plane that is as thick as glass.\nAll that\
  \ the child saw for the first time, caused him admiration and joy due to the fact\
  \ that he recognize what he didn\u2019t know before. At that moment, the child looked\
  \ at adults who were in the hospital ward, at the time of his expedition in a small\
  \ room in the hands of parents, and thought: \u201CWhy do adults not feel such a\
  \ delight from this world, from which I am ready to cry with happiness, cry from\
  \ the magnificence of this nature, cry from what I can feel? \"\nA young guy standing\
  \ in the door of the room, drew attention to the interrogative expression of the\
  \ child\u2019s face, approached the child, smiled sweetly, posing as the elder brother\
  \ to the newborn, and taking him in his arms, addressed the readers of this essay:\n\
  Do you know what is in common between this child, who has just entered this life,\
  \ takes the first steps and is surprised at each new phenomenon, whether it is heat\
  \ from the sun or a breath of wind, and an adult?\nWe all behave in the same way\
  \ when we find ourselves in a new place that we have not been to before and which\
  \ we have not yet seen in the photographs. We all wonder at the glass skyscrapers\
  \ of New York, admire the wildlife of South America, fear the living conditions\
  \ of some cities in India or Africa, admire the freedom and tranquility of Australia.\
  \ But all this passes when we see the same place a second time. \u201CI\u2019ve\
  \ been to many countries, believe me, I know what I\u2019m talking about,\u201D\
  \ the guy said convincingly.\n\u201CAnd here is my advice to you, dear brother\u201D\
  \ - the guy turned to the child, who carefully studied what his older brother was\
  \ telling him, - \u201CTravel! Travel wherever you can go, make your discoveries\
  \ and experience this world! You will be surprised, but not less than now! Experience\
  \ feelings of joy and inspiration and these feelings will fill your life with an\
  \ unforgettable experience and pleasure! \u201D\n38 years later.\nMount Sagarmatha,\
  \ Everest. 8 thousand meters above sea level. Snow-capped peaks and clouds, cut\
  \ by peaks of mountains. 360 degree clear horizon.\n\"Hello, World\" - tears of\
  \ joy shone in the eyes of the man, and a smile froze on his face from the magnificence\
  \ of the world that was down there - \"I am happy, Brother!\""
