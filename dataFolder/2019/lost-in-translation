Text: Well, this weekend has been quite an adventure. Things did not go as my friends
  and I had planned. We had originally planned on going to see the Cliffs of Moher,
  which are the highest cliffs in Europe in Donegal. We had it all set up. On Friday
  morning we woke up at 5am and left our apartment at 6am, so that we could catch
  the 6:50am bus to Dublin. It took about two and a half hours to get to Dublin. Once
  we were in Dublin, we took another bus to a town called Sligo. That took another
  three hours. We had to get off in the town of Boyle because that was where we were
  going to stay for the night. When we got off the bus, there was someone already
  there to pick us up. He was one of the people that ran the hostel that we were going
  to stay at for the night. He drove us there, but come to find out, it was in the
  middle of nowhere. There was a lake, a field, and that was it. It was nowhere near
  town. There was no way we could get to town, unless we got a taxi. We were trying
  to find a way to go to the cliffs, but there was no use. It would have cost us more
  to get back to our hostel from the cliffs. With no chance of going to the cliffs,
  we decided at 4pm to just take a bus back to Dublin. So we got a taxi and it picked
  us up from our hostel and took us to the bus stop in town. It was another three
  hours back to Dublin. Once we got to our hostel in Dublin it was already around
  midnight. We had been on a bus for eleven hours total that day! So that's what happened.
  So what if our plans got changed. Some of the best moments in life are those that
  go unplanned.
