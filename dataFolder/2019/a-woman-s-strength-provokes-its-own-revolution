Text: "\"The views of those snowy mountaintops were so extraordinarily tranquil and\
  \ beautiful\", I thought as I shifted through some incredible sights reminiscing\
  \ about my Christmas travels of 2012 in the heart of Austria. My heart was yearning\
  \ for such a sight again while a slight breeze was rushing over me like a soft cloud.\
  \ \n\nI was sitting in the middle of a glorious park in southern California with\
  \ my best friend, Marcie. She was just the right mixture of sassy and sweet that\
  \ made her an explosion of fun with sounds of laughter at every corner! With a 5\u2019\
  0 shortness that was constantly pointed out, she made sure that life was truly experienced\
  \ and with just one gesture we always knew what the other was thinking about. We\
  \ had been friends for years but distance had tried to keep us apart, not realizing\
  \ that it was actually making our relationship stronger and deeper in its connection\
  \ to the new memories we were about to experience together\u2026 \n\nThe leaves\
  \ bloomed so sweetly into the incandescent air of the midnight summer breeze. A\
  \ sort of hearty laugh was heard in the distance, which was surprising considering\
  \ that it was midnight on the hottest day of the year. However, it was not only\
  \ a laugh but a mix of a cry for help as this woman was lost in a strange country.\
  \  She had arrived a few days ago to escape away from her parents' plans to marry\
  \ her off to the most eligible bachelor in Egypt. Marcie and I were in awe at this\
  \ poor creature but we were a bit fearful to approach, as we weren\u2019t even supposed\
  \ to be there. Yes, we were quite the rebels looking for trouble at the most inopportune\
  \ times!\n\nEventually, we approached her and heard her heartbreaking story of being\
  \ forced into a marriage she didn\u2019t want, all because it was financially beneficial\
  \ for her family. She wanted to marry for love and have a real, true connection\
  \ with the man she would call her husband. This was completely understandable for\
  \ who wouldn\u2019t want that?! She told us that she had wanted to come to California\
  \ because she had heard what a wonderful state it was with billows of nature and\
  \ peace, with the busyness of L.A. traffic. However, the southern tip was more calm\
  \ and relaxed which made for a perfect location of her retreat from home. This was\
  \ something that she had to do in order to find out what she really wanted - to\
  \ stop living for her family\u2019s wishes and desires and instead figure out what\
  \ hers were. \n\nWe didn\u2019t hear from her again until years later when we got\
  \ an invite to her fabulous wedding in Switzerland! She traveled quite extensively\
  \ through America and landed on her feet in strange lands but she was beyond happy\
  \ to be able to independently explore and journey through her early \u201820s. Life\
  \ was quite incredible and she learned who she really was: she was a young woman\
  \ who thrived in new, distinct cultures and met a great batch of people who heard\
  \ her story. In the end, she became fierce and strong in her raw vulnerability of\
  \ her character and met the love of her life at a poetry reading where she disclosed\
  \ absolutely everything!\n\nThe courtship was fast and passionate filled with endless\
  \ laughter and a promise of a happiness she hadn\u2019t felt in years - she was\
  \ free. Her voice was back and she was no longer this fragile, scared woman we found\
  \ stranded in the depths of southern California but a powerful spokesperson for\
  \ women all around the world in taking their life back and creating a legacy. She\
  \ had inspired us to move on from the same routines of American life and risk it\
  \ all in a new country and we found ourselves there too!\n\nHer name was Lina Al-Rashaid,\
  \ changed to \xD6berg and she was a person filled with so much knowledge and life\
  \ that it caused its own type of revolution in our era.."
