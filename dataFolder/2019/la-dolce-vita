Text: "Venice is known as the city with stunning views of bell towers, churches and\
  \ gondolas. So, imagine my surprise when I arrive and rather than being engulfed\
  \ by la dolce vita, I am instead engulfed by.....fog. Fog so thick that you can\
  \ barely see your hand in front of your face. However, I quickly realise that when\
  \ one loses one sense; the others are heightened to recompense. \n\nWhile the icy\
  \ fog chills you to the bone the bells chime out, every peal reverberating around\
  \ me, signalling that the day is beginning. Elegant ladies, going about their day\
  \ in the most genteel of ways, emerge out of the fog momentarily. They leave a snippet\
  \ of their animated conversation on my hungry ears, before disappearing once more.\
  \ The smell of pastries, coffee and pizza waft across the air and make my tummy\
  \ rumble. The sound of a roaring engine and agitated water suggests a vaporetto\
  \ is nearby. Sure enough, \"scusi\" one hears as people, dogs and trollies race\
  \ past onto the patiently waiting vessel which shortly heads out into the vast empty\
  \ expanse and is soon subsumed into nothingness. \u201CNessun dorma, nessun dorma\u201D\
  \ wafts past me accompanied by the strains of a violin, ironic really as it seems\
  \ that the whole world is asleep, shrouded in a thick cosy blanket. The gentle lapping\
  \ of an oar moving through water comes next; a gondolier, expertly guiding his boat\
  \ through the obstacles posed not only by the lagoon but by other ships and the\
  \ inability to see beyond the end of his boat. His voice can be heard pointing out\
  \ traditional landmarks to his well-paying guests who are forced, unfortunately,\
  \ to rely on their imagination to conjure up the amazing sights.\n\nA dog\u2019\
  s sudden bark startles me from my revelry. They, maybe, are the one creature on\
  \ this floating lagoon that benefit from the fog. As their eye sight works better\
  \ in the low light, they can make out passing people and odd scraps of food left\
  \ by tourists. Taking the pavements at a much greater speed than humans would be\
  \ comfortable doing, Venice becomes a dog\u2019s world, quite literally. \nIt is\
  \ a miracle people don\u2019t fall into the lagoon in such an environment\u2026\
  .. one wrong foot and splash! But, this is not a sound that hits my ears. It does\
  \ make me realise though why so many murder and mystery films have been set in Venice;\
  \ the perfect setting for a murder shrouded in suspense, uncertainty and darkness.\
  \ Suddenly I don\u2019t feel so comfortable in my own company and so I channel my\
  \ thinking into other more light-hearted directions..... It is also a city where\
  \ people find love, though it seems rather difficult to contemplate such an emotion\
  \ existing in the circumstances. \n\nAs if some great being has heard the thoughts\
  \ in my head the mist begins to burn off and beloved landmarks start to appear;\
  \ the dome of St Marks, a prow of a cruising ship, a pigeon or two, the vaparettos\u2026\
  \ The world I had rather selfishly begun to believe was just Venice and me is suddenly\
  \ shared with all the people around me; masked, unmasked, rich, poor, young, old,\
  \ Italian, English alike. \n\nFinally, full sight is resumed and with it does the\
  \ magic die? One could believe that the illusion is broken, the flaws of this unchanging\
  \ city revealed in the cracked pavements and peeling paint. Yet, I believe it has\
  \ hardly begun. My complete senses finally fully restored and a-tuned to all around\
  \ me I break out into the world of la dolce vita once more and love every second."
