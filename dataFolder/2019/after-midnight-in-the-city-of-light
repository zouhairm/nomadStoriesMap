Text: "\u201CTovazinha,\u201D my host mom said around the breakfast table, \u201C\
  I heard you come in at 2 AM last night.\u201D\n\u201CDesculpe, Manel, sorry.\u201D\
  \ I demurred. I internally kicked myself, burning up with hot anger. I\u2019d already\
  \ messed up as an exchange student daughter, only a few weeks into my 7-month stay.\
  \ Shame-faced, I asked, \u201CHow much earlier would you like me home?\u201D \n\u201C\
  I don\u2019t want you home before 5 AM,\u201D she said, then paused and smiled when\
  \ she saw the shock on my face. \u201CYou\u2019re young. Stay out until the bakeries\
  \ open and begin to make their pao de queijo. Dance in the street. Make a mistake.\u201D\
  \ \nMy real mom, the one back in Providence, Rhode Island, used to say, \u201CNothing\
  \ good happens after midnight.\u201D She also used to say, in response to my exasperated\
  \ assurances that I was responsible, a good kid, \u201CIt\u2019s not you I don\u2019\
  t trust. It\u2019s everyone else.\u201D\nAt 17, I was beyond the age my host mom\
  \ Manel would\u2019ve dreamed of giving me a curfew, and earlier that week she had\
  \ asked me for sage advice: what time should she have her 14 year old daughter come\
  \ home from the clubs? What was my curfew at home at that age? Was 2 am appropriate?\
  \ Three?\nI told her I couldn\u2019t make a fair comparison. There was really no\
  \ good reason for a 14 year old to be out that late, and certainly nothing for them\
  \ to do, in the U.S. It was as if the Portuguese had never heard of kidnappers,\
  \ rapists, drunk drivers, or muggers.  I regularly traipsed home, rolling my ankles\
  \ around on steep and broken cobblestone sidewalks, even in practical sneakers,\
  \ alone as the sun was coming up. I never once felt unsafe, in a city of 3 million\
  \ people.   \nEven as one of my friends, another exchange student from the U.S.,\
  \ was robbed at knifepoint while sitting and speaking English loudly with another\
  \ friend on the steps of an illuminated statue in an 18th century square, I was\
  \ somehow invincible, impervious to these seemingly isolated incidents. \nSo we\
  \ stayed out. We lined up at the backdoor of the bakeries in Bairro Alto for the\
  \ pao de queijo. We wandered into discotheques and jumped up and down in sweaty\
  \ rhythm with men twice our age to the song of the summer, Shakira\u2019s Hips Don\u2019\
  t Lie. We felt young and safe and sexy. We met a Portuguese soap opera star who\
  \ met us the next day for bacalhau and sangria.  We jumped fares on the back of\
  \ trolleys, hopping on the exit steps and stepping off at each stop to let off the\
  \ stooped over widows draped in black, and the German tourists alike, as we wound\
  \ up the hills of Lisbon towards the Sao Jorge Castle, from which you could see\
  \ the entire city, bathed in the light that all Lisboetas recognized as special,\
  \ a light that had enchanted poets like Fernando Pessoa, a Portuguese icon, for\
  \ centuries. We gorged ourselves on flaky and gooey custard pies, enough to make\
  \ my host mom comment, admiringly, \u201DYou\u2019re getting fat, Tovazinha,\u201D\
  \ and I took it as a source of pride that I was living this Lisbon life the right\
  \ way. Every time she came back from a day trip to Sintra, an hour outside of Lisbon,\
  \ she would bring back special cinnamon tarts made only in that town, rolled up\
  \ sticky in their crinkly paper and stacked in a divine, messy column. \nI was young,\
  \ and I was silly, and no harm came to me. I had less responsibility and more respect\
  \ from the adults in my life than I ever had before, and I would be in for a rude\
  \ awakening at the end of the summer when I went back to Rhode Island to prepare\
  \ for college.  Lisbon was not an Eden; there were dark corners, urine-soaked walls,\
  \ unwelcome catcalls. Those cobblestones sometimes made me trip. But the special\
  \ light touched me, the pao de queijo filled my belly, and nothing bad happened\
  \ after midnight."
