Text: "A Little Slice Of Heaven\n\nWe had come a long way \u2013 both physically and\
  \ figuratively.\n\nWe had taken the Shatabdi train from Pune to Delhi, and a second\
  \ connection to picturesque Dehradun in central Uttarkhand. We had snaked our way\
  \ up dizzy hairpins on a rickety, overcrowded bus, welcoming the balmy breezes and\
  \ fresh mountain scents that gradually replaced the oppressive heat and dust of\
  \ the plains.\n\nOur honeymoon in Dhanaulti, a charming little hill-station of Garhwal,\
  \ would mark the end of one chapter and the start of the next. A whirlwind courtship\
  \ in the teeming metropolis of Bombay, with its quaint coffee shops in leafy by-lanes\
  \ and its distinctive oceanfront had led us to circling seven times around the holy\
  \ fire (Hindu equivalent of exchanging marriage vows), not many months later.\n\n\
  And now here we were, rounding a corner and coming upon a forest of deodars fanning\
  \ out in panoramic symphony, Himalayan torchbearers of poise and peace, motionless\
  \ in meditative Vrks\u0101nas. I breathed in the sweet, woody fragrance at once\
  \ exotic, but in some intrinsically universal way, evoking home.\n\nIt was the month\
  \ of May, but chilly in the upper reaches of the Himalayan foothills.\nWe ate new\
  \ potatoes. There was no dearth of potatoes, and little of everything else. We lit\
  \ wicks in oil-fuelled lamps when it got dark. We drank cups of milky tea at the\
  \ little chai stall outside our modest abode, and listened with fierce concentration\
  \ as we tried to make sense of the Garhwali spoken by locals. \n\nOne morning we\
  \ set out deep into the woods, led by Jitesh our youthful cook and man-of-all-needs.\
  \ One could take off in any direction and length of time without encountering anyone.\
  \ This was before the Forest Development Authorities established the Eco Park and\
  \ developed the area, making it a tourist destination.\n\nJitesh directed us to\
  \ the Surkanda Devi temple. We trekked up the roughly 3000m elevation to the shrine.\
  \ We held hands; at times we stayed deep in thought, other times we marvelled at\
  \ the surrounding rounsilii trees.\nThe Surkanda is one of the 52 Shaktipeeths which,\
  \ according to Indian mythology, house a body part of the Goddess Shakti. In the\
  \ form of Sati, she had taken her own life, and Lord Shiva her husband, had roamed\
  \ the universe with her remains, so grief-stricken was he. To stop him from doing\
  \ the tandava or the dance of destruction, Lord Vishnu directed his Sudarshan Chakra\
  \ to cut Sati into 52 parts each of which fell at a spot, and was enshrined as a\
  \ place of pilgrimage or worship.\n\nI stole glances at my husband of four days.\
  \ We were eerily alike. It was like witnessing a part of you, with your ideas and\
  \ thoughts, break away into another being who loved you back for what you were.\n\
  \nIt was with reluctance that we left this haven, where one day flowed languidly\
  \ into another, with no urgent duty to dispense or need to fulfil. But we carried\
  \ the joy back in our hearts.\n\nMy husband, this man who valiantly held out against\
  \ all odds, died not long after. He was young in years, but an old, old soul. He\
  \ would have found his little place in heaven. But the two of us, we would always\
  \ have Dhanaulti."
