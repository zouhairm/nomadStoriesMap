Text: "My travel story beings with an application, just like this one here, to the\
  \ University of Wisconsin for a six month student exchange. As daunting as it may\
  \ sounds, I believe it was a much needed leap of faith at this time of my life.\
  \ I was unsure what to expect, never having travelled overseas by myself before.\
  \ As my preparations began, by surprise I was also awarded a scholarship to support\
  \ my time over there. In exchange I was to document my weeks over there and put\
  \ together a final travel summary of my experience. I took this on board as an opportunity\
  \ to accurately reflect upon my time in the United States and eagerly began documenting\
  \ from the time I applied for my visa. \n\n\nArriving in Los Angeles was euphoric.\
  \ I had just entered the first phase of a new chapter of my life. I had prepared\
  \ an itinerary for travel before my exchange actually began which first took me\
  \ to San Francisco. Here, I stayed in a backpackers where I met a lovely young chap\
  \ (who was actually Australian) who was playing the guitar outside the hostel. We\
  \ instantly bonded over our love for music and formed a friendship that is still\
  \ alive today. Being in a hostel forced me outside of my comfort zone and allowed\
  \ me to connect with other people, from all over the world, over mutual interests.\
  \ \n\nI travelled to a few other beautiful places, including wonderful Yosemite,\
  \ New York, Yellowstone and Canada before finally settling in Wisconsin. My first\
  \ day at university was terrifying but exciting. The exchange students from all\
  \ over the world were placed together. I immediately bonded with a girl from Sweden,\
  \ whom became a close friend throughout my journey. I tried to enrol in every extra-curricular\
  \ activity I could (such as volleyball, pool tournament) so that I could associate\
  \ myself with American students and the American way of life. Indeed, I became close\
  \ with several American students and was invited to their places over the middle\
  \ of semester break. \n\nIn particular, I remember a male who drove me around his\
  \ home town. I met his family, who were very down to earth and changed my \"typical\"\
  \ opinion of the American people. Although they had the American flag attached to\
  \ the outside of their house, as typically seen in movies, they remained reasonable\
  \ when talking about opposing political views and were not loud or obnoxious. I\
  \ found that they were very proud of their homes, embedded in their traditions (such\
  \ as church, large dinners, their American dream) and were very conservative. Similarly\
  \ to the other Americans I came to know were also very similar. However, they were\
  \ always willing to converse and help whichever way they could.\n\nDuring Christmas\
  \ time, I spent a couple of weeks with a lovely family of four. They weren't expecting\
  \ any snow this year but to our surprise, there was snow on Christmas day! This\
  \ was the first time I had ever seen snow and it was absolutely beautiful. What\
  \ better was to witness it than in the North of America. Unfortunately, there were\
  \ no moose (not sure if that is the plural word!) but myself and the two girls were\
  \ able to enjoy snowball fights, building snow men and making snow angels. We sung\
  \ traditional Christmas carols (Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby etc) and enjoyed a marvellous\
  \ feast (including turkey). Unfortunately, these events are not something we experience\
  \ in Australia. The family invited me into their home like I was one of their own,\
  \ it was very comforting.\n\nAt this point in time I didn't want to leave. I had\
  \ forged friendships from people all over the world and had fallen in love with\
  \ the American lifestyle. Even though many Australians do not want to visit America\
  \ as they believe it is \"just like Australia\", I encourage people to travel there\
  \ first and form an opinion afterwards. Judging a book by its cover shuts a person\
  \ off from discovering what makes people, places and things unique. If I had learnt\
  \ one thing from this journey, it would be to take every opportunity that arises...\
  \ you will likely end up a better person for it."
