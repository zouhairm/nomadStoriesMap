Text: "As final exams came to an end my friends and I were restless to escape the\
  \ isolated city of our boarding school, UWC Dilijan. After the monotony of the past\
  \ few weeks, we were hungry for adventure. We wanted to go on a road trip but we\
  \ decided to forgo hiring a taxi for hitchhiking all the way down to Lake Sevan.\
  \ We wore swimsuits under our clothes and headed out.\nDuring the walk to the city\
  \ center we realized that we were perhaps not the ideal combination of nationalities\
  \ for this trip. I was from Pakistan, a country that does not recognize Armenia.\
  \ My other friend was from Turkey, a sworn enemy country of Armenia's. The third\
  \ one of us was a Russian girl, whose country also does not have the best relations\
  \ with Armenia.\nDespite the astonishingly low crime rate in Armenia, we starting\
  \ feeling uneasy about the prospects that lay ahead of us. It felt even more dangerous\
  \ to us coming from a very sheltered bubble of a boarding school. Hence we decided\
  \ that I would claim to be Indian, my Turkish friend would claim to be Greek and\
  \ my Russian friend would claim to be Latvian. \nThe thumbs up hitchhiking gesture\
  \ was not very well known in Armenia and after many drivers giving us a thumbs up\
  \ back, a car finally stopped. Confident in our assumed identities, we slid into\
  \ the car of a friendly Armenian man heading down to the country capital, Yerevan.\
  \ He asked us where we were from and we shot back our rehearsed lies. Unfortunately,\
  \ he seemed to know more about our assumed nationalities than we did, asking us\
  \ political questions and trying to discuss people whose names we hadn't even heard\
  \ of. \nWhen we were dropped off to Lake Sevan, we decided that we were going to\
  \ be honest about our nationalities henceforth as we did not want to take away from\
  \ the conversations and connections we could make as had happened with the previous\
  \ driver. \nOur original plan had to be modified slightly because Lake Sevan was\
  \ still frozen solid, despite what the warming weather had fooled us into believing.\
  \ We took pictures to pretend we had gone in for a dip and started looking for somewhere\
  \ to eat.\nWe headed to a small, empty restaurant overlooking the river and were\
  \ greeted by a plump Armenian woman who was all smiles and hand gestures to make\
  \ up for the language barrier. We feasted on bread and lavash and fresh, pungent\
  \ cheeses as well as fried fish straight from Sevan, washing it down pomegranate\
  \ wine and finishing with honeyed thyme tea. \nWell fed and happy, we headed back\
  \ to our school and this time we told our driver our real nationalities. He played\
  \ us Bollywood, Russian and Turkish songs for the whole ride and we finished with\
  \ pop American music, all of us singing along as the sun went down."
