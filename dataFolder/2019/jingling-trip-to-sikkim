Text: "Ladakh just happened in June and it was just October. That is no time for enough\
  \ water to have flown down the Mula Mutha, tepidity of monsoons notwithstanding,\
  \ for us to have forgotten the dizzying altitude or the spectacular views. There\
  \ is but one way to keep the views and lose the sickness and it goes by the name\
  \ of Sikkim.The dreary weather continued through the following day forcing us to\
  \ restrict ourselves to predominantly indoor sights. Our first stop was the Rumtek\
  \ Monastery, the seat of the Karma-Kagyu sect of Tibetan Buddhism since 1959 - when\
  \ they were forced to leave Tibet after the Cultural Revolution.Rain, rain went\
  \ away mysteriously the next morning as we woke up to a spotless blue sky and a\
  \ jaw dropping view of the Kangchenjunga range, that too from the comfort of our\
  \ hotel room. At 8,586 m, Kangchenjunga is the third highest peak on the planet.\
  \ The natural bit includes getting sprayed over by the roadside Rimbi falls, deafened\
  \ by the roaring Kangchenjunga falls, spiritually cleansed (no, I don\u2019t know\
  \ what that means either) by the sacred Khecheopalri Lake. The man made bit is dominated\
  \ by the 1705 Pemayangtse Gompa, the oldest monastery in Sikkim and also the most\
  \ significant of the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism.All of the following day was\
  \ spent driving back to Gangtok \u2013 mostly along the same route that we took\
  \ on the first day. The scenery that stunned us on the way up looked remarkably\
  \ pedestrian after the highs of Gurudongmar and Yumthang. Now that we have done\
  \ East and the North, South was next on our radar. It is small enough to be covered\
  \ as a drive-by destination as we make it to West Sikkim from Gangtok. Someone seems\
  \ to have concluded that Sikkim has no attraction for the tourists and where the\
  \ nature has failed man has to step in. Stepped in he has by stomping his presence\
  \ all over South Sikkim. Strangely enough the end result is not all that bad. One\
  \ can check out these man made attractions in the chronological order as you take\
  \ the long route towards West. The first is the only tea garden in Sikkim, Temi.\
  \ After taking a much needed tea break, especially for the driver who somehow managed\
  \ to doze off on such scarily winding roads, we headed to Namchi where there seems\
  \ to be a competition to build tall structures. 2km before Namchi stands the 45m\
  \ tall Statue of Padmasambhava. Built in 2004, it is the tallest statue of the Buddhist\
  \ monk in the world. At Namchi is the 33m tall Shiva statue lording over a sea of\
  \ temples, including the replicas of the char (four) dhams across India. As explained\
  \ earlier, no one really knows what a dham is or why there is only four of its kind\
  \ in the world. Even grander is the brand spanking new Sakhyamuni Buddha complex\
  \ in Rabongla, where a 41 m tall Buddha meditates within a perfectly manicured gardens.\
  \ After gawking at these structures, we made our way to Pelling where we could finally\
  \ rest our aching necks. At a head spinning 5,200 m, that was enough to give me\
  \ a blackout. I have no recollection of how I made it back to the car or how my\
  \ camera had so many stunning lake pictures. After many more hours of driving through\
  \ hundreds of river beds and past thousands of pretty waterfalls, we reached our\
  \ night stop, Lachen\u2019s twin - Lachung, perched half way up the \u201Cother\u201D\
  \ valley in North Sikkim. As we had planned to spend two nights in Lachung, we could\
  \ make a more leisurely trip to the end of the said valley, which incidentally has\
  \ a name, rather famous one that too \u2013 Yumthang. The extra night at Lachung\
  \ also gave us a chance to drive past the end of Yumthang valley, up to a mountain\
  \ pass called the Zero Point, sitting at a relatively humane altitude of 4,600 m.\
  \ No, no one seems to know what is so zero about that point. The lesser known nearby\
  \ Rabdentse ruins, the capital of Sikkim between 1670 and 1814, is where we spent\
  \ the last afternoon of our trip enjoying the fabulous hilltop views contemplating\
  \ where we should have breakfast, lunch and dinner, the only things to look forward\
  \ to during the day long return journey that awaited us the following day."
