Text: "2am It\u2019s quiet. Everyone is asleep. The only sound is from the turning\
  \ of a page and of my pen as I write notes. The room is dim, only the light from\
  \ a small lamp with the shade turned toward me is glowing so I don\u2019t have to\
  \ turn on the much brighter, overhead light. I settle into my \u201Cstudy zone\u201D\
  , which is the seat on the couch next to the table with the lamp; a blanket and\
  \ a pillow on my lap to support my notebook and whatever text I\u2019m studying.\
  \ This is my ritual, night after night. It\u2019s an early start each morning following\
  \ only a few hours of sleep. Always up before six, I have a full day ahead of me!\
  \ Any doubt of my exhaustion can be exonerated by the dark circles under my eyes\
  \ and obvious sleep deprivation was written all over my face. I\u2019m frustrated\
  \ and in tears. I scream to myself, \u201CI can\u2019t do this! What was I thinking?\
  \ I\u2019m too old, I don\u2019t have time, and I\u2019m definitely not smart enough\u201D\
  ! All these thoughts bounce around in my head like the ball in a pinball machine\
  \ but I\u2019m the one about to go \u201Ctilt\u201D. At 39 years old, I decided\
  \ to go back to school with the intention of obtaining a degree. \nWhy? Why am I\
  \ pushing, forcing myself to read the chapter again, find more algebra problem examples,\
  \ or practice writing HTML code that isn\u2019t even assigned? Why do I fight fatigue\
  \ daily when I could just as easily take a nap instead of torturing myself with\
  \ trying to write the perfect paper for a psychology class that has nothing to do\
  \ with my degree? What contributed to this decision to not only go back to school\
  \ after almost 20 years but to attack it with the intensity of a speeding 18-wheeler\
  \ going down a steep mountainside? Insanity? Probably. \nI never had an \u201CA-ha!\u201D\
  \ moment when I said to myself that I w...\n\n\n... middle of paper ... \n\n\n...s\
  \ the Japanese see the results of productivity they are looking for on paper, they\
  \ don\u2019t care how the outcome is achieved. \nFPI took many things from me such\
  \ as dignity and self-worth, replacing them with a clinical depressive disorder.\
  \ A chaotic work schedule kept me from my family when I needed them and they needed\
  \ me. Although my time there was tumultuous, it was also a learning experience\u2014\
  it was the beginning of the end. The end of how I wanted to live my life. The end\
  \ of being disparaged. I knew that I never want to be employed in a factory ever\
  \ again. Moreover, I didn\u2019t want to be an employee of anyone ever again but\
  \ ached to be my own boss. Short of winning the lottery or marrying a millionaire,\
  \ the only way to achieve that is to further educate me. So here I am; exhausted\
  \ and weak, I am ready to learn. I am ready for the new beginning."
