Text: "People said, going to Mecca for Hajj pilgrimage is a trial of patience. Some\
  \ even said that it\u2019s a \u201Creward trip\u201D, if you are a good person,\
  \ you will get a smooth, nice, happy, enjoyable trip. Otherwise, if you\u2019ve\
  \ been bad person, you\u2019ll get punished. Ouch!\n\nIn Indonesia, the Hajj pilgrimage\
  \ is arranged by government through local district office. As the most populous\
  \ Muslim country in the world, Indonesia gets the highest quota of people to perform\
  \ Hajj. However, since so many people intend to go, every year the quota limit is\
  \ never enough, and we must register years before, without able to choose the date\
  \ of departure. The longest waiting period is more than 30(!) years. Even before\
  \ going to Mecca, the trial of patience had already begun.\n\nThe Hajj ritual takes\
  \ only 4-5 days, but Indonesian government makes the cheapest package takes around\
  \ 40(!) days trip. Yeah, poorer people are considered to have plenty of free time,\
  \ unlike the rich ones who have to race against time. Time is money, isn\u2019t\
  \ it? \nIn 2015 I went to Mecca for Hajj, to accompany my 78 year old (with Parkinson\
  \ disease) father. We registered to get the cheapest package in 2010, so it\u2019\
  s considered quite short period of waiting, compared to others. It\u2019s a good\
  \ sign, I guess.\n\nRegardless of that good sign, thinking about staying with a\
  \ group of same strangers for 40 days makes me stressed out. I\u2019ve ever traveled\
  \ round the globe for a year and often stayed in hostel dorm, but never stayed with\
  \ the same strangers for 40 days in a row. Moreover, the crowd of Indonesian pilgrimage\
  \ is dominated by old people, with less traveling experience. Some even have no\
  \ experience of traveling by plane. \n\nMy first test of patience happened during\
  \ quarantine day in Jakarta. The dorm facilities were good: spacious room for 4\
  \ beds, completed with private bath room, AC, TV, and we got 3 times good taste\
  \ meal! The problem is, room mate. I shared the room with 3 ladies, whom one of\
  \ them acted as if she\u2019s the owner; she created rules and told us the do and\
  \ don\u2019ts to be obeyed. Hey, who does she think, she is? \n\nApparently, in\
  \ pilgrimage, the more you hate something, the more you attach to it. It\u2019s\
  \ almost like karma. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when I found out that a person\
  \ beside my seat in the flight was the one and only THAT \u201Cruler lady\u201D\
  . Also, she was my room mate in 2 cities and again, sat beside me in the flight\
  \ back to Jakarta. In total, I spent 40 full days together with her!\n\nRuling is\
  \ only one of the ruler lady \u201Ctalents\u201D. Aside that, she couldn\u2019t\
  \ bear AC cool temperature, so she prefers the AC to be turned off (in the middle\
  \ of summer in Saudi Arabia!), loves to show off everything, always sings with very\
  \ loud voice to proof that she used to be a band\u2019s singer, and on top of all,\
  \ she has body odor problem! OH MY GOD! \n\nI thought trial of patience is about\
  \ how to handle physical things, like (ritual) walking under the heat of Saudi Arabia\u2019\
  s summer sun, queuing to get into the main Mosque, or else. In fact, dealing with\
  \ smelly annoying person requires more patience than being thirsty and exhausted.\
  \ \n\nI wish God forgives me, for grumbling all the time, for 40 days. Aamiin."
