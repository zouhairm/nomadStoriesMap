Text: "I was 18 years old and I had one free week, no university in a week. What can\
  \ I do? I've never been in france... Let's travel! All the thoughts I had just in\
  \ a minute an a fact that came true. I search for a cheap plane ticket and I just\
  \ prepared my backpack. On monday I was taking the plane.\nI remember that I was\
  \ frightened, it's was my first solo travel and my parents were really worried but\
  \ I just said: there are many people crossing countries with nothing with them just\
  \ seeking a good live and I'll be worried for travelling with all my things to france?\
  \ Stupid thoughts! \nWhen I arrived there I felt nervous because I had never taken\
  \ any train or subway on my own. I live in a small country of Spain and that's another\
  \ world for me, but I managed it! \nI had to go to some people's houses there in\
  \ France. I didn't know this guys at all, I met them in a travellers app where people\
  \ look for a place to stay or they offer a place. I was scared about the fact that\
  \ I didn't know them.\nThe first guy lived in Montpellier, he was from Argentina\
  \ and he was staying in like a kind of artist house where all of them have a room\
  \ but they share their common spaces as the livingroom and kitchen. \nIt was amazing\
  \ one of them sings, another one dance, others play some instruments, etc. And me?\
  \ I love dancing! So they started playing some music with makeshift instruments\
  \ as plates, glases, pots, spoon and all the stuff there but it sounded really nice\
  \ so I start dancing with them and there appear like a flowing magic. It was amazing!\
  \ We end the night sleeping all in something like a huge sofa in the livingroom.\n\
  I really enjoyed staying there with them. I also attended to some spanish-moroccan\
  \ music that I loved. But \"unfortunally\" I had to leave. My next stop was Marseille.\n\
  And I say \"Unfortunally\" because it also was amazing. There, I stayed in the house\
  \ of a french guy that had a big motorbike so he decide to show me the creeks of\
  \ cassis. It was \nunbelievable how the wind strokes my face in the motorbike next\
  \ to the sea in our way to the creeks with this beautiful sun shining. I felt as\
  \ though I was flying.\nWhen we arrived to the highest point we spend a lot of time\
  \ there. Watching the views like if we were kings. Then we went to a place there\
  \ that seems to be a cave but that was also a restaurant. We ate there some oysters\
  \ and some seafruits that were delicious and we restart our journey back again with\
  \ the motorbike next to sea. \nThis experience was incredible to me, and I could\
  \ enjoy it all because I decided to travelspontaneously by my own, with nobody else,\
  \ without knowing what could happen, where I was really going, just giving a chance\
  \ to life to surprise me... And it did."
