Text: "It wasn\u2019t even something I knew I desired so badly when I applied, until\
  \ I found myself daydreaming of what it would be like to open an acceptance letter.\
  \  I realized this was because it would symbolize the culmination of everything\
  \ I aspired towards for so much of my life.  My dream of moving to New York City,\
  \ pursuing a career in the performing arts, and receiving an education that I thought\
  \ to be far above my reach, were all entangled and hinging upon this letter.  In\
  \ November 2018 I received my acceptance letter to Columbia University, and less\
  \ than two months later moved to my dream city to start the spring semester.\n \
  \    I had never travelled much as a child, which brought both a greater allure\
  \ to moving to a big city, and a strong anxiety towards it.  New York City is where\
  \ I always pictured myself being someday; it was the only city I ever spent much\
  \ time in, due to its proximity to my home and the opportunities for dancers.  As\
  \ a dancer, I had spent so much time learning how to execute various kinds of leaps,\
  \ but this metaphorical leap into a new life proved to be a much more difficult\
  \ challenge.  Despite feeling like there was so little tying me to my hometown;\
  \ trusting myself enough to leave, to make this leap, caused me great uncertainty.\
  \  This move had been my dream for so long, but now that the opportunity was upon\
  \ me, it felt daunting.  Nonetheless, when I finally leapt, I felt a contentment\
  \ I had never known before.  \n     This city is larger than life, and with that\
  \ comes strong emotions.  The subway can be a source of anguish; the train turning\
  \ into a dragon in its caves.  Or, it can be a place of peace - where you read and\
  \ write until you have forgotten to check where you are.  You can be walking amongst\
  \ a great mass of people that tests your patience one minute, and the next find\
  \ yourself completely alone down a tree-lined street.  I have been told of the tunnels\
  \ that wind beneath my feet at school, from the Manhattan Project, from the old\
  \ asylum; from various times and for various purposes, yet they all bring me the\
  \ same insatiable curiosity.  They are a quiet place underneath a bustling campus,\
  \ a testament to the variance of the city.  Amelia Earhart was rumored to be a skilled\
  \ navigator of these tunnels, having taken them all around campus, and famously\
  \ on top of Low Library, sitting atop Morningside Heights.  I believe some of her\
  \ adventurousness still pores out of these tunnels, infecting the curious.  \n \
  \    All of this curiosity leads me to ferret out unusual destinations across the\
  \ city; creating a treasure map of adventure in my mind.  This is to say, it is\
  \ not possible to get bored in this city unless one is too complacent to seek out\
  \ the oddities.  I may not be able to travel to far away lands right now, but I\
  \ can travel to the edges of this infinitely interesting island.  \n     Being in\
  \ a city filled with so much excitement has only furthered my education.  Some things\
  \ I may need to learn in a lecture hall, but sometimes there are things you can\
  \ only learn by exploring the depths of this island.  So many voices and perspectives,\
  \ as well as so much history, and events unfolding every day, only serve to open\
  \ the mind.  If you are infinitely curious, the city will give you infinite knowledge.\
  \  \n     Since leaping, I have found that returning to school is not daunting,\
  \ but exciting.  I have learned that the city contains not only a wealth of opportunities,\
  \ but a wealth of experience; take every chance and listen to every anecdote.  Further,\
  \ this city is ever evolving; listen to every voice but make yours heard too - it\
  \ is the voices of today that shape tomorrow.  Because I leapt, I am no longer limited;\
  \ I can be the artist I dreamed of being while attending an elite school.  A leap\
  \ into the unknown opened a whole new world of opportunity for me."
