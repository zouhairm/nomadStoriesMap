Text: "\"A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma\", so defined Sir Winston\
  \ Churchill the largest country on Earth. Arriving at Sheremetyevo on the very first\
  \ day of the Football World Cup was not so charming as one could expect, but during\
  \ the weeks I spent there, charm was about to come. Russia is the land of superlatives,\
  \ and I can tell why. The worst traffic jams are in Moscow, and on the day the home\
  \ team was a bout to debut, and people from all the world were gathering to cheer\
  \ the most popular event of the globe, couldn't be more hectic. My friend picked\
  \ me up at Bielorruskaya train station, and I could hear the crowds whispering as\
  \ if the Red Army soldiers, were kissing their loved ones for the last time just\
  \ before traveling to the front. That big square where Maxim Gorky stared at me\
  \ was my real feel I finally arrived to the land of the greatest novelists of all\
  \ time. As we drove past the impressive Foreign Ministry building I could feel the\
  \ mighty power of the \"evil empire\" looking where to invade next, even 007 sneaking\
  \ into that big, bad building to do some exceptional move. Wide avenues stretching\
  \ to the horizon of that huge city, where golden churches shone to the almost summer\
  \ sun, I finally made it to my friend's parents house, where her loving mother cooked\
  \ a Russian delight in the form of Tefteli, made of meat and rice. \nI was astonished\
  \ by the splendor of the Kremlin. The mighty fortress containing churches, museums\
  \ and treasures inside, made to indulge the most demanding Tsars of them all. The\
  \ privilege was immense to watch and hear the clock and bells ringing to the brightest\
  \ sun of noon of my life. Saint Basil's , charming colors came next, the Red Square\
  \ where the ghosts of Tsarist soldiers, Revolutionaries, captured German soldiers,\
  \ the Red Army, and hordes of tourists could be all heard at once, in contrast to\
  \ the silence of Lenin's mummified body. Perhaps the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour\
  \ was the least expected surprise. Built by the Tsars, brought down bye the Bolcheviques,\
  \ reconstructed by this new Russia trying to cope with the World and itself, shining\
  \ on the Moskva River was the ecstasy of the afternoon. As I navigated down to the\
  \ River, along the Gorky Park, listening to a cliche's song, I felt immensely changed,\
  \ distorted, turned into an utopian dreamer of peace and brotherhood among nations.\
  \ In that dream I walked through the Gorky Park, a museum of modern art, the Tverskaya\
  \ Street bars, the Bolshoi Theater,  chanting to the sound of cheering crowds coming\
  \ from all places on Earth. I woke only a couple of days later to the sound of crowds\
  \ singing their National Anthems before the battle of Moscow, where an unexpected\
  \ team defeated the World Champions at Luzhniki Stadium. That day the Aztec gentlemen\
  \ played like warrior poets. Standing beside Lenin Statue I fell into an utopian\
  \ dream again where I was the Champion of the World. My mind does only remember,\
  \ I partied like a Tsar that night!\nFeeling as great as Peter I flew to Saint Petersburg\
  \ to continue my journey. Strikingly beautiful, the Hermitage Museum holds many\
  \ of the most impressive crafts human beings are able to create. The building itself\
  \ is a masterpiece, but chambers, furniture, tapestry and flooring do not fall behind.\
  \ I always go for the Dutch, when it comes to art, they were able to picture their\
  \ days magnificently. Churches, cathedrals, channels and houses make Saint P a worthy\
  \ visit, but I had my moment of faith and solitude walking silently toward the Kasanskaya\
  \ Lady while her parishioners await their turn to kneel before her. Crossing oneself\
  \ the Orthodox way, on every step you take to gratefully pay my respects to the\
  \ Lady of the People. The Russian People, the ones that made this trip one of my\
  \ very bests. Rostov on the Don, and back in Moscow where I left my adoptive family,\
  \ my friend, her husband, her child, her father and mother, who I will always hold\
  \ in my heart like that bortsch soup I had."
