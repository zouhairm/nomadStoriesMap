Text: "I'm 33 and never travelled alone...don't get me wrong, I'll happily travel\
  \ to Edinburgh for work or travel across London to a cafe but I've never been to\
  \ a proper fun filled exploration to a foreign land. It's all I ever wanted to do.\
  \ A yearning to explore sparked by a childhood memory of finding my Father's friend's\
  \ cabinet and sifting through its possessions like I was an archaeologist stumbling\
  \ upon treasures. But I had never delved into that interest. Generalised Anxiety\
  \ Disorder is my toxic friend. The other half of me which tells me to worry about\
  \ everything and break seemingly normal rights of passages into momentum walls to\
  \ climb. \n\nSo when my childhood friend told me she was going to Split in Croatia\
  \ and my plans to see Tel Aviv with friends crumbled, I did a thing I don't usually\
  \ do - I asked if I could come along. She checked with her friend and happily said\
  \ yes. Now, this might not be travelling alone you may think but my brain decided\
  \ that this holiday would act as a halfway house to travelling alone. I would join\
  \ them and take a day here and there to do my own thing with the safety of knowing\
  \ I could come back to them. So that's what I did. I arrived to a dingy apartment\
  \ 5 minutes from the Roman centre; walls a musty brown with random pictures of Split\
  \ covering strange holes in the wall. It had the smell of an old grandma and I hastily\
  \ left to check out the town. Split is Croatia's 2nd largest town and the Old Town\
  \ is tucked within the walls of Diocletian's Palace, erected by the Roman emperor\
  \ in the 4th century. Enter through the main Roman gates and you're greeted by a\
  \ large courtyard with pillars and a blue clear sky over your head. Around you is\
  \ a complex maze of stone and marble built across the eras. Getting around is a\
  \ fear of mine - what if I get lost? How do I get home to safety? The maze of intertwining\
  \ paths reminds me of Marrakech. In a way Split is perfect for the more anxious\
  \ traveller. With Google maps as a guide, you can work your way around but even\
  \ if you want to improvise, it's never more than 20 minutes walk from one side of\
  \ the Old Town to the other. As I strolled along the smooth, beige walkways I was\
  \ given a glimpse of how a Roman town would have looked many centuries ago, it's\
  \ architecture mostly untouched. What occupies the walls now are more modern restaurants\
  \ serving traditional Dalmation food and souvenir markets with their gifts of dried\
  \ lavender and pots of honey for sale. \n\nThe great thing about Split is how affordable\
  \ it is. I took \xA3500 for 9 days travelling and (including accommodation). I still\
  \ had money left when I came back. That was another fear gone. \n\nWalking around\
  \ the town and nearby markets felt so calming and safe that it gave me the strength\
  \ to explore further. A quick online search gave me the knowledge to catch a bus\
  \ from the coast which is next to the Old Town - a busy but charming seafront with\
  \ a string of souvenir shops, restaurants and bars lining the glistening and ultramarine\
  \ blue waters. The bus took me all the way up from the town along a winding hill\
  \ peppered with rocks and green trees. I got off and climbed down some rocky steps\
  \ and found myself at an isolated and picturesque place called Kasjuni Beach. Not\
  \ so busy like the Harbour but still rocky like all of Split's beaches. The sun\
  \ beamed down on the deep blue sea brushing the white rocks. There's something about\
  \ the sea and beaches which gives me comfort - maybe It's my Mauritian genes, but\
  \ I took my jumper out, laid it flat and sat while being almost meditative. The\
  \ mixture of calm and heat against my body with the joy of finding this place on\
  \ my own made me feel like all my problems back home aren't so bad. I can travel.\
  \ I can really do this..."
