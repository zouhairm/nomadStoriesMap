Text: "\u201CThis is what Jakarta should be,\u201D I said to my partner Abe, gesturing\
  \ to Singapore\u2019s Marina Bay as the sun sunk into the horizon beyond the city.\
  \ We were flying to Jakarta the next day, expecting to spend a week in the city\
  \ catching up with family and friends before backpacking across the islands of Java\
  \ and Sulawesi. It was longer than a week.\n\nJakarta has never been at the top\
  \ of anyone\u2019s \u2018must visit\u2019 cities. With a population of over 10 million\
  \ people Jakarta is crowded, dirty and humid. Everyday people flood the streets\
  \ on their motorbikes, ojeks (motorcycle taxis), cars and even horse and carts,\
  \ creating some of the biggest and most impressive traffic jams in the world. If\
  \ you think that Arctic caribou have the most impressive migration on earth than\
  \ you\u2019ve never seen Jakartan commuters at peak hour. \n\nJakarta had always\
  \ been an afterthought to me, a gateway through which I could explore many other\
  \ less crowded and more beautiful areas of Indonesia\u2019s far-reaching archipelago.\
  \ It is easy to compare Jakarta unfavourably with other Asian metropolises which\
  \ offer much more in terms of unique architecture, iconic cultural events and more\
  \ accessible infrastructure. Pillars of a busway half-built still stand in the middle\
  \ of Jakarta\u2019s major roads, like monuments to failed efficiency. It was a very\
  \ grey-looking piece of tempe that made Abe and I decide to remain in Jakarta for\
  \ a couple of extra days. It was longer than a week.\n\nAbe and I could hear the\
  \ humming of electricity as we crossed an overpass so close to nest of live wires\
  \ on a power pole that I could have reached out and grasped one. \u201CIndonesian\
  \ safety standards,\u201D Abe laughed. I just thought wistfully of Singapore. We\
  \ were walking to meet my Indonesian friend Thesa  at a park called Taman Suropati.\
  \ Green spaces aren\u2019t exactly Jakarta\u2019s best features. Just a couple of\
  \ nights before I had seen a soldier-like security guard at Kota Casablanca, one\
  \ of the luxury malls in Jakarta, chasing a big brown rat through the nearby gardens,\
  \ trying to kick the rodent with his combat boots. This park however was green,manicured\
  \ and full of Jakartans enjoying a rare blue skied Sunday morning. \u201C Is it\
  \ ok if we go see my friend quickly? I have to give her this,\u201D Thesa said pulling\
  \ out a bottle of water. Her friend, it turned out, was practising European long-sword\
  \ fighting. \n\nGwaith-i-Megyr, the long sword fighting club was three years old\
  \ the members excitedly told us and followed a specific Italian fighting technique,\
  \ differing from other Northern European styles. The group was happy to have an\
  \ audience as they were practising for an upcoming performance. They started their\
  \ routine, counting as they changed positions 1\u2026 2\u2026 3\u2026 4, and swung\
  \ their 1.5 meter polished wood swords against each other with a clang. I felt humbled.\
  \ This astonishing group of young Indonesians, men and women, Muslim and Christian,\
  \ had found a passion for one of the most obscure art forms. They weren\u2019t the\
  \ only group at the park with obscure interests.\n\nOn the side of the path leading\
  \ through the centre of the park there was a girl scrolling through Instagram with\
  \ one hand and holding a tarantula with the other. \u201CYou can hold the tree tarantulas,\
  \ but not the burrowing ones,\u201D said a member of the Jakarta Tarantula Club.\
  \ To the left of them, a member of a different group was unzipping a duffel bag,\
  \ removing a large goanna monitor from the bag. It was flicking its tongue rapidly,\
  \ probably tasting the thirty or so sugar gliders climbing up the shoulders of the\
  \ Jakartan Sugar Glider Club nearby. Everyone at the park was mingling, exchanging\
  \ spiders, snakes and sugar gliders for the perfect social media shot. The sound\
  \ of excited chatter mixed with the lilting sounds of a string ensemble that had\
  \ gathered to practice. Abe, Thesa and I spent the rest of the morning in Taman\
  \ Suropati, holding all sorts of creatures and yes, taking photos for Instagram.\
  \ Abe and I never did end up making it to Sulawesi, but it wasn\u2019t such a long\
  \ week in Jakarta after all."
