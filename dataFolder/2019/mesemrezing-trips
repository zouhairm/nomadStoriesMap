Text: "Mesemrezing Trips in 2017 one of my memorable Expeirences Travelling out of\
  \ country and moreover a lady who is a small town girl when she enters USA the Big\
  \ Giant of all and as I enter USA my first trip was in Las Vegas we all know Las\
  \ Vegas as a city of sin but i look into the other way being a traveller locally\
  \ I found out the best talent in Las Vegas streets and The lights dosent make you\
  \ feel if its a day or night u feel out of the world when u see those disco lights\
  \ and the games throughout people coming to enjoy the fun games along with poker's\
  \ and stuff and the local food is just out of the world i then realised life is\
  \ not all about money honey life is all about different experiences and to just\
  \ memories and click pictures from ur Brain mobile phones are just technology but\
  \ human brains is the best in capturing memories when.i look back now at t pictures\
  \ and memorise it through my brains its a lovely picture all together I am a person\
  \ who loves to talk and interact with people and I made some amazing friends out\
  \ from there and also added them to the social media of mine and as I said next\
  \ city which i landed was a larger than life picture for me or rather for an ordinary\
  \ girl like me New York a paradise the place of skyscrapers and everything huge\
  \ there from the buildings to the pizza loved every bit of walking through the streets\
  \ of New York to eating the roadside pizzas toojumping with you like a small girl\
  \ in front of times square after all that was a child good dream for me I have few\
  \ more of childhood dreams and destinations which if i get selected I shall experience\
  \ and write my thoughts what ever i am writing at the moment is thoughts which are\
  \ coming directly from the heart because if u dont experience a place beauty through\
  \ ur heart u cannot pen that done on the paper is what my thinking says \nThen i\
  \ visit California the place of major celebrities and I also felt like one when\
  \ i entered universal studios I also wana be on the show of Ellen like a small kid\
  \ it was taking me through lot of nostalgic memories when  i entered the Jurassic\
  \ park theme water park all I wanted at that moment was my late dads support and\
  \ his hand coz he was the one who introduced me to watch Hollywood movies and I\
  \ become a first fan of Hollywood movies since then i was looking out for the real\
  \ kinda celebrities to just appear before me when i visited Beverly hills and the\
  \ king of pop MJ when i entered his place I was like wish he was alive and wish\
  \ I cud even see his little image my day or my life would be made \nAs i alwsys\
  \ say life is all about living the moment and enjoying the moment from the places\
  \ which u have visited to the people whom u have met sometimes there are good experience\
  \ sometimes bad but never loose heart life is such u have to be positive in all\
  \ given situations in life \nFor me travelling is exploring and getting deep into\
  \ the subject about their culture their food their life style and most important\
  \ civilization I love to find out more on civilizations and culture and also the\
  \ food most important is the connection with the people and how well do u communicate\
  \ witj them on the local language and behaviours \n\nSo travel is all about experience\
  \ writing and keeping the frame in mind and not clicking pictures but clicking pictures\
  \ through ur mind and capturing it till ur last breathe in ur heart \nWishing all\
  \ the travel enthusiast out here all t best and may the best perosn win and capture\
  \ all the best living destinations in t world and write their amazing experiences\
  \ where we all can go ahead read and see the world through their eyes \n\nThanks\
  \ for taking time to read this gb"
