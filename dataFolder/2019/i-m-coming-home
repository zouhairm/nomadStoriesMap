Text: "\u201CWhy can\u2019t you be a part of our family?\u201D my mom yelled at me.\n\
  \n\u201CWell Kelsey\u2019s parents let her go wherever she wants! They don\u2019\
  t over-protect her like you,\u201D I screamed back.\n\nMy dad and brother sat at\
  \ the dinner table as my mom and I ping-ponged our arguments. \u201CI never got\
  \ to study abroad in college. This is my chance.\u201D I had quit my sales job with\
  \ nothing secured.\n\nMy mom wanted the perfect daughter to have a strong career.\
  \ At that point in my life, I was nowhere near perfect and my career was in a huge\
  \ rut.\n\nInstead of searching for a job, I booked a trip to Vietnam for 2.5 months,\
  \ thinking it would be a perfect opportunity to reconnect with my extended family\
  \ after 16 years.\n\nI was surrounded by a crowd of Nguyens when I hopped off the\
  \ plane and finally passed through customs. My family and I run in packs and everyone\
  \ came to say welcome, even my elderly grandma.\n\nThe first couple of weeks were\
  \ exciting, because it was exactly how I imagined the nomad life. I was visiting\
  \ all the tourist attractions, I barely had to work and I was shopping a lot. But\
  \ soon enough, those things became tiresome.\n\nHow could someone keep going full-force\
  \ and spending money she didn\u2019t have? Being unproductive took a toll on me,\
  \ especially when every other person had to continue on with his daily life.\n\n\
  A shadow of loneliness draped over me. I felt disconnected from the culture, my\
  \ surroundings and the people. Did I make a mistake? Was I running away from reality?\
  \ There was so much doubt. On certain days, it was just me, the maid and my aunt-in-law.\n\
  \nMy aunt-in-law, Mo Moui (Auntie 10), stayed at home to manage her kids and care\
  \ for my grandparents. From the look of sheer boredom and probably the perkiness\
  \ at any chance to leave the house, she took pity on me and dragged me along her\
  \ errands.\n\nAs I followed her around like a lost puppy, my eyes saw what most\
  \ tourists wouldn't see. Locals pattered down the alleys bartering for the best-quality\
  \ fruits and vegetables. I got to practice some bartering myself. Pharmacies under\
  \ construction were on every corner; Her sister\u2019s pharmacy was one of them.\
  \ I got to sit in the front, speaking to customers who were expats. My grandparents\u2019\
  \ 5-storied flat needed constant cleaning, because street dust flew through the\
  \ opened windows and settled on the green floor. I got on my knees to scrub the\
  \ floors.\n\nHer life somewhat became my life. \u201CThis is what my life would\
  \ have been like if I was born in Vietnam,\u201D I thought to myself. It was not\
  \ necessarily better or worse than my current life, but it was clearly different\
  \ than the lifestyle I wanted.\n\nAfter a long day of work, we rested in the hammocks\
  \ in the kitchen. Mo Moui asked me, \u201CWould you ever want to marry a Vietnamese\
  \ boy and move here?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo, I wouldn\u2019t want to live here.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CHow come?\u201D\n\n\u201CLife for a woman here is hard work. You get on\
  \ your knees to scrub the floors, but we use a Swifter. You also hang dry your clothes,\
  \ but in the U.S., I just throw the clothes in the dryer.\u201D\n\nShe laughed at\
  \ me, teeth showing-something taboo for a Vietnamese woman, according to Grandpa\
  \ - because the perception that Americans have it \u201Cgood\u201D was true. She\
  \ was expected to take care of the family. She didn\u2019t have the tools to ease\
  \ the physical labor. I took those things for granted.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m so spoiled,\u201D\
  \ I self-reflected.\n\nIf my parents hadn\u2019t escaped from Vietnam in 1975, I\
  \ wouldn\u2019t have been born in the United States, and I might not even have the\
  \ choice to have a profession. They provided me the life that they couldn\u2019\
  t have in their home town and abandoned their comfortability.\n\n2.5 months prior,\
  \ I flew to Vietnam to run from my life and away from the home my parents created.\
  \ In the end, I unexpectedly found that I want to return to the U.S. and be a part\
  \ of my family. My life and view was forever changed."
