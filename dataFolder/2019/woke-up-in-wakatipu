Text: "\u201CThat\u2019s New Zealand.\u201D my mom told me when I asked about the\
  \ picture at the back of a milk carton. The pixelated image showed black and white\
  \ cows grazing on a lush green field framed with pine trees and snow-capped mountains\
  \ at the background. \u201CIt looks very peaceful,\u201D I said \u201CI\u2019d like\
  \ to go there one day.\u201D My mom smiled at me. \n\nFor a child of a family with\
  \ a hand-to-mouth income in the Philippines, travelling abroad is a dream. But my\
  \ mom gave it her best to create a home filled with dreamers and believers.\n\n\
  My older brother, the first dreamer and believer of the family, surprised me with\
  \ a trip of a lifetime as a gift for graduating from college. This was it. The picture\
  \ at the back of a milk carton failed to bring justice to the scenery before me.\
  \ Queenstown is a painting. And it was more than what I ever imagined (except for\
  \ the cows, I didn\u2019t see cows in Queenstown, I saw them in Warkworth).\n\n\
  Everywhere I looked there were rolling hills clothed in carpets of wild grass with\
  \ hundreds of pine trees sticking out like sore thumbs. It framed the turquoise\
  \ waters of Lake Wakatipu, so clear you can see the ducks\u2019 webbed feet get\
  \ caught on pebbles, yet so deep that just several feet from the shore the water\
  \ looked like the night sky with the rays of light bouncing off the surface in place\
  \ of stars. Completing the view was the Southern Alps, nearly stripped of its snow\
  \ caps from the summer warmth, standing proud.\n\nI know why New Zealand is like\
  \ this. Kaitiakitanga \u2013 the connection of people and nature. Kiwis take care\
  \ of nature as if it is a part of them.\n\nI wandered the streets of Queenstown\
  \ for hours. It looks very peaceful, I thought, but inside me was conflict. My mom\
  \ died one month before I embarked on my journey. \n\nOvercome with grief I felt\
  \ as though I am here and not here at the same time. Watching the people but not\
  \ seeing the people. Listening to nature but not hearing the nature. I felt like\
  \ I was just another element in the picture at the back of a milk carton. \n\nSomewhere\
  \ on my walk I abandoned my shoes and had settled on a boulder at the edge of the\
  \ lake. I watch the sun begin to set. My trip was about to come to an end.\n\nIn\
  \ this place that I dreamed to visit, I was asleep. And it was a nightmare.\n\n\
  The masterpiece before me is suddenly tainted by a can of soda floating down the\
  \ lake. Litter in New Zealand? Confusion then panic set in when I realized the litter\
  \ came from my feet. Kaitiakitanga. It was several meters away when I shot up and\
  \ bolted.\n\nCatching the litter just in time, I slipped and plunged into 6 degrees\
  \ ice water. For a few seconds everything was truly silent, dark, and cold. I wondered\
  \ how much time I still have in this world. I splashed around and when I came up\
  \ to the surface, I could see and hear again.\n\nI woke up in Wakatipu. And it was\
  \ not a dream."
