Text: "Many people believe that karinding and the mouth harp family are the first\
  \ musical instruments made by humans. Based on the mapping carried out collectively\
  \ by the Antopodium website, there are at least 1169 names for mouth harps worldwide.\
  \ In West Java, Indonesia, this instrument is known as karinding. In this area,\
  \ karinding is closely related to the teachings of management of rules of order,\
  \ divinity, humanity, society, the law of time, love of the homeland, management\
  \ of mountains and rivers, and much more. Until now, his philosophy was the basis\
  \ of various movements carried out by young people in exploring and carrying out\
  \ the values of the local wisdom of the Sundanese, the tribes that inhabited the\
  \ West Java Region. The entire Indonesian archipelago alone has 80 different names\
  \ for mouth harps.\n\nAs the first musical instrument, karinding has a very long\
  \ history, folklore, legend and mythology. Since this musical instrument was created,\
  \ it spread throughout the Sunda Plain, between the Himalayas and Sahul, mainly\
  \ through trade on the Silk Road. From West Java, he spread throughout Indonesia,\
  \ Southeast Asia, Asia, and finally into the Eurasian Region, especially in Mongolia\
  \ and Siberia. From there karinding then spread rapidly to Europe and then Africa\
  \ and America. One of the most important areas and the key to the spread of mouth\
  \ harps from Asia to Europe is Yakutia, the heart of Siberia which is now the Sakha\
  \ Republic. This area has 700 rivers, green taiga, very exotic mountains, Permafrost\
  \ Kingdom in Ust-Kut, and is very rich in gold, diamonds and wood.\n\nYakutia hosted\
  \ the seventh International Jewsharp Society Congress in 2011. The festival received\
  \ from a strong support from the Sakha State and highlighted the special as an international\
  \ instrument. Besides the concerts, the conference, 3 international competitions,\
  \ for makers and players, a Guinness World Record, an event at the Museum of Khomus\
  \ of People of the World, the participants were also a memorable participation in\
  \ the Yhyakh , the Sakha National Summer Solstice Festival.\n\nThe trip to Yakutia,\
  \ for me, was an important journey to write down many things related to the spread\
  \ of this ancient musical instrument. Not only did I examine the karinding distribution,\
  \ I also had to study the structure of nature, mountains, rivers, and old streets\
  \ in Yakutia and become an important route connecting Asia and Europe. The city\
  \ of Yakutia is one of the main destinations because there the mouth harp, in Yakutia\
  \ known as Aman Khuur and Khomus, is a daily musical instrument of its people. Therefore,\
  \ studying culture and society is also one of the interesting things to write about.\
  \ Dubbed the coldest city in the world, the best time to visit Yakutia is May to\
  \ August when temperatures can usually reach 20 \xB0 C.\n\nThis trip has become\
  \ important for me because it will greatly help the research and writing of books\
  \ on variety of Indonesian mouth harps. Previously, I had written the book \"History\
  \ of Karinding Priangan\" and the trip to Yakutia would further complement my study\
  \ in the next book, \"The Variety of Indonesian Mouth Harp\"."
