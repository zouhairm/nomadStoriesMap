Text: "I didn't expect to miss my flight, i didn't expect to have my breathe taken\
  \ away by a city, I didn't expect acquaintances to become perfect strangers and\
  \ I definitely didn't expect to find my soul mate in Milan.\L\LI knew Vanessa for\
  \ about 2 months from University. Sharing a common interest in travel, we decided\
  \ to be travel buddies to the cheapest place our student budget permitted. Two weeks\
  \ later, destination: Milan.\L\LWe arrived at Milan Malpensa airport. We then embarked\
  \ on a bus to Milan Central and took a tram to our Airbnb. It was a one bedroom\
  \ hollywood esque flat. Posters of Marilyn Monroe and Don Corleone covered the walls\
  \ accompanied by a pair of directors chairs.\L\LSince it was dark, Vanessa and I\
  \ decided to explore Milan by night. Ascending the subway stairs in the city centre\
  \ had a \u2018stairway to heaven\u2019 feel, as it opened to the magnificent white\
  \ marble structure of Milan Cathedral and the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele. The square\
  \ glowed with golden Christmas lighting. We walked through the Galleria, admiring\
  \ the exquisite artwork covering its floors, stopping at the famous tiled mosaic\
  \ bull, stepping on its testicular region and spinning around three times for good\
  \ luck. We walked past the DaVinci museum and statue, before having dinner at the\
  \ only restaurant open at 9pm, McDonalds, before heading to our Airbnb. I slept\
  \ on the sofa while Vanessa slept in the bedroom.\L\LThe next morning, we headed\
  \ back to the Cathedral for Instagram photographs, wearing my new bomber. Vanessa\
  \ wore a floral skirt and a leather jacket.  As we took photos, street vendors approached\
  \ us and gave Vanessa raw macaroni to feed pigeons. They took instant-print photos\
  \ of us and asked if we were married. We laughed and paid for our photo. \L\LLunch\
  \ was in a classic Italian cafe that had Luciano Pavarotti\u2019s \u2018O sole mio\u2019\
  \ playing in the background. We ate authentic Italian Risotto and pasta, before\
  \ heading to Sforza castle. Vendors again tried to convince us to buy souvenirs\
  \ by saying that my \u201Cwife\u201D was very beautiful. We walked around the castle\
  \ grounds before heading to Centro Strocio home of Davinci\u2019s original Last\
  \ Supper, before going to see SanSiro stadium.\L\LDinner was along the Navigli canals.\
  \ Here I had the best Burger I'd ever tried. It was an amazing wild boar burger.\
  \ After a few drinks we returned to the Airbnb. As I headed to the sofa, Vanessa\
  \ followed me and we sat there talking all night. she eventually fell asleep on\
  \ my shoulder. Vanessa completely opened up emotionally.\L\LWe woke up suddenly\
  \ realising we were late for our flight. We rushed to the airport, however the boarding\
  \ gates had closed. The flight crew refused to let us on the flight. We discovered\
  \ that the only available flight was the next day. We were stranded for another\
  \ night. Vanessa found an Airbnb in a small town 30 mins from the airport. It was\
  \ a cosy one bedroom flat overlooking a forest, with aesthetic wood work designs\
  \ and high end furniture.\L\LAs the realisation of missing our flight sank in, we\
  \ sat laughing to ourselves of how stupid we felt. I fell asleep, awakening to see\
  \ Vanessa standing at the balcony. She handed me a cup of coffee and asked playfully,\
  \ where I was taking my \u2018wife\u2019 for dinner. I smiled. \L\LWe got dressed\
  \ and walked to the nearest town, Casorate Sempione. We found a restaurant and ordered\
  \ 2 Pizzas and a bottle of wine to takeaway. At the Airbnb, I set up the dining\
  \ table and lit a few candles. Over dinner, Vanessa suddenly says \u201Cthere is\
  \ just something missing\u201D. I reply \u201CI know just the thing\u201D, as i\
  \ queued my slow Jazz album on Spotify.\L\LAfter dinner we watched a movie on Netflix\
  \ before talking into the night again. As we were talking, our eyes met followed\
  \ by our fingers. Before any of us could understand what was happening, we were\
  \ kissing.\L\LNeither of us expected to find that missing our flight in Milan would\
  \ be a turning point of our lives. Neither of us expected to find a best friend,\
  \ soul mate and perfect stranger in each other."
