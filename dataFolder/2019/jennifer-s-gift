Text: "It wasn't the first time id been here, nor would it be the last,\nalthough\
  \ hazy, many years have since past.\n\nI tasted the ocean,\nI tasted sun,\nAll those\
  \ years ago, \ntaking me back where it begun.\n\nA million miles , a moment to soon,\n\
  in that instant, could have run for the moon.\n\nA time lapse between us, a tale\
  \ of no end, \ncaution is caution, it is not your friend.\n\nSlowly bridging into\
  \ the unknown,\nriding only, a machine of flesh and bone.\n\n\nJennifer didn't mean\
  \ to enter, in fact this is the kind of thing she never sees or looks at doing....\n\
  \n\nJennifer worked as a call girl, to make enough money to get her through the\
  \ weeks.. a lady of the night, an escort a companion... wrap it up however you like,\
  \ yep, she was a prostitute. \n\nShe fell into the job, sorta, after a break up\
  \ from her last boyfriend, he had come out to her about how he used to enlist  the\
  \ \" certain company \" of ladies when he got his midnight hankerings..\n\n\n\n\
  Jennifer was distraught. she took a job down this path to try and figure out why\
  \ ?Her job took her to many different countries to many different men who she learnt\
  \ very many different things from... But she didn't feel like she had learnt \"\
  why\"  yet. \n\nPerhaps she never would.\n\nJennifer , wasn't particularity  pretty\
  \ or smart.  She stood 5ft 6\" with a slight hunch and mousy brown hair. Her skin\
  \ was pale with few freckles dotted around her nose and cheeks, her best asset was\
  \ her eyes... she was just, plain.\n\nJennifer looked at the advertisement, she\
  \ was curious and a slight emotion she hadn't experienced in a while started to\
  \ fill within her, she was nervous, she was inspired , she was excited.\n\nJennifer\
  \ never felt like she amassed to much , she was always coasting drifting and moving\
  \ year to year feeling like she wanted to do this, then that , then this again.\
  \ Jennifer was lost. \nThe one thing, she always had, was her writing, she wrote\
  \ journals and stories and poems, anything that her heart was feeling any empty\
  \ emotion that was , hurt or love or scorning, when she wrote, she felt like she\
  \ was everything. she felt real and raw and vulnerable, emotions that everyday duties\
  \ couldn't induce.\n\nJennifer thought, what if,  what if I could win this , I could\
  \ go and change my life, I could be everything , everyday.  I could write with the\
  \ beauty of the world I have seen.\n\nSo , full of inspiration and motivation and\
  \ excitement she took to her computer , her words flowed beautifully from her finger\
  \ tips as they tapped away on the keys... she wrote about her desires , her writing\
  \ and her passion for travel, her life and how she hoped to create a new chapter\
  \ for herself. \n\nShe had finally finished , glaring at her words she was reading\
  \ over it all, before she would hit send.  In the moment ,she felt  like everything."
