Text: "I\u2019ve always found solitude in the unknown. Whenever life got difficult\
  \ or confusing getting lost in an unknown place gave me a sense of clarity. After\
  \ I graduated university I moved abroad to Paris, France. With a suitcase and a\
  \ passport I left to start the greatest adventure of my life. Now I\u2019ve been\
  \ to 15 counties (and counting) I have seen the most beautiful places, met amazing\
  \ people and have had moving experiences while backpacking alone. I have been able\
  \ to purse my passion of comedy and have been successful at stand up comedy, something\
  \ that has been terrifying and rewarding. These past few months I\u2019ve had thousands\
  \ of \u201Cfirsts\u201D, some amazing, some fun and some really hard. At the end\
  \ of the day I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing, thankful for this adventure\
  \ I worked so hard for. \n\nThe day I left the United States I came across a quote\
  \ graffiti on to the back of the airplane seat in front of me, never let your soul\
  \ settle. It has become a mantra for me to purse my dream of traveling. \nMost of\
  \ my adult life I have done exactly what I want to do when I want to do it for the\
  \ sake of adventure. Going to new places and exploring brings me a ridiculous, cheesy\
  \ giddy type of happiness. With my choices I have missed out on opportunities, memories\
  \ with some of my favorite people and lost friendships and relationships. But at\
  \ the end of the day I still wouldn\u2019t change a thing because I think it is\
  \ important to find what makes you happy first instead of relying completely on\
  \ other people. People and places come and go but you have to live with yourself\
  \ as long as you\u2019re alive. Don\u2019t give up something that makes you smile\
  \ for the sake of someone else. In other words, never let your soul settle. \n\n\
  I would enjoy to go to Portugal to perfect my writing skills and concise my travel\
  \ story into a conciese piece. I want to write something that not only conveys the\
  \ humor and adventures I\u2019ve experienced, but also inspires other to travel\
  \ as well. Thank you for your time and for considering me for this opportunity."
