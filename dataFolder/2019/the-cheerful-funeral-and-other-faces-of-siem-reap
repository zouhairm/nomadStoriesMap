Text: "The most known and the most ancient faces of Siem Reap, Cambodia, are the faces\
  \ of Buddha in the Angkor temples. However, Siem Reap has a lot of little buddhas'\
  \ faces -- everywhere. All the nation is getting enlightened, getting opened after\
  \ the decades of struggling for independence, political instability, and horrors\
  \ of the Pol Pot regime. And people are becoming calm and smiling like buddhas.\n\
  \nIf cheerful music is playing in a Buddhist monastery from early morning, it is\
  \ not a celebration. This is a funeral. Children are playing near the coffin. After\
  \ the ceremony women in white clothes are coming back home, but no one is crying.\
  \ Death is nothing but the movement of the wheel of Samsara on the way to Nirvana.\
  \ Death is a promotion.\n\nThe sunshine of the midday liquates everything. Locals\
  \ are hiding, sleeping in hammocks or eating rice with fish (there is plenty of\
  \ fish as Tonle Sap Lake is nearby). Schoolchildren are riding their bicycles home,\
  \ most of them transport younger brother or sister.\n\nForeigners are invited to\
  \ the school near the center of Siem Reap to practice English with children from\
  \ 5 to 6 pm. The primary school teacher with slightly grey hair and lined face is\
  \ happy to see everyone. She is slim and barely taller than her pupils; probably,\
  \ her childhood fell on the \"Red Khmers\" regime. She is calm, although the children\
  \ are shouting, running and climbing on the tables. After the lesson pupils are\
  \ singing and hugging the volunteers. Children are telling that they want to be\
  \ teachers, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and policemen (that is the full list named\
  \ by kids; no one claimed to be an astronaut, businessman or politician).\n \nAt\
  \ night, one can see an incredible picture -- the market without customers. The\
  \ market, where the inevitable equilibrium between the number of vendors and customers\
  \ is not established yet. Khmers are ready to sell thousands of their unique handworks\
  \ for any price but there is almost no one to buy. A young man is painting Angkor\
  \ Wat in the moonshine near his shop. Oil on Canvas. Nearly all the pictures in\
  \ the shop are devoted to Angkor Wat. That causes an erroneous feeling that is nothing\
  \ more to do in Cambodia. US dollar and Thai baht are also accepted \u2013 rare\
  \ visitors don\u2019t even bother to buy Cambodian riel. Plenty of empty tuk-tuks\
  \ (local taxi) are standing along the street and a few tourists with the \u201C\
  lonely planet\u201D guides are walking around. A woman is sleeping with her three\
  \ children in the husbands\u2019 tuk-tuk.\n\nSiem Riep can invite more tourists,\
  \ and they will come soon. But will the town save its own faces then?"
