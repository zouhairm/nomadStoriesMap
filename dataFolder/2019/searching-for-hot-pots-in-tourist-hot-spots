  By the fourth restaurant rejection, my stomach cramped as a serious case of hunger\
  \ took over and I began to worry, sweat collecting on the bridge of my nose in the\
  \ hot, humid air.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s 11pm on a Saturday night, we\u2019ll be fine,\u201D\
  \ my partner said in an attempt of reassurance. \n\nThey gray city streets were\
  \ filled with people kicking off their weekend happenings. Growing up in an urban\
  \ city, dingy, concrete slabs and high rise buildings were familiar to me, but I\
  \ had never been anywhere as densely populated as Hong Kong. Diverse amounts of\
  \ people, faces, stories, and history in such a small area; generations of both\
  \ locals and tourists, coming together to create this compacted community. Surely\
  \ we\u2019d be able to find some late night dining in a bustling city like this,\
  \ right? \n\nWe were craving local, authentic cuisine after falling for over-priced\
  \ chili crab set at \u201Cmarket price\u201D the day before. Our late night search\
  \ took us to Causeway Bay\u2019s iconic Times Square building. Dumplings, roasted\
  \ goose, and dim sum tempted us through closed restaurant windows, the reflection\
  \ of neighboring neon lights illuminating our disappointed and hungry gazes. By\
  \ the time we reached the 11th floor, we were finally in luck \u2013 the local hot\
  \ pot joint was still open and there was a table for two.\n\nWithout the crutch\
  \ of our native tongue, we left the culinary choices to our waitress, who until\
  \ that point, we had been playing charades with. We managed to order two Tsingtao\
  \ beers, which we toasted to our first hot pot experience and the anticipation of\
  \ what was to come.\n \nTo our delight, a split bowl of bubbling, savory broths\
  \ was centered on the table followed by plates of uncooked, unknown, thinly sliced\
  \ meats. We recognized the prawns as such, but the arrangement of discolored meatballs\
  \ were up for debate. The broths formed a yin and yang combination of visual aesthetic\
  \ and flavor \u2013 on one side, a light, broth with onion and garlic, and the other,\
  \ a red, heat heavy, chili broth. A basket of fragrant green and red chilies, green\
  \ onion, various spices, oils, and fresh garlic soon followed, which we eventually\
  \ figured out was for making our own signature dipping sauce. Eagerly waiting for\
  \ the food to turn the proper shade of cooked was as hard as deciding which combination\
  \ of meat and sauce to try. \n\nWith a full belly and full feeling of content, I\
  \ reflected on foods ability to bring communities together. The quote \u201Cfood\
  \ is our common ground, a universal experience\u201D made sense as I looked around\
  \ the restaurant at generations of locals sharing this traditional meal that dates\
  \ back 800-900 years to Mongolia. \n\nI wondered why I ever worried about finding\
  \ this authenticity when I knew serendipity, as it always has when traveling, would\
  \ lead me to a place of local connection and introduce me to the heart of the city\
  \ through food."
