Text: "This is it, I think. This is the horrible thing that\u2019s going to happen\
  \ because you didn\u2019t think of the possibility of wildlife. You thought if we\
  \ can\u2019t even spot them on safaris, we aren\u2019t going to see them out here.\
  \ We are where Jim Corbett hunted tigers but you forgot. Now one of us is going\
  \ to be bitten or attacked, just sit, just keep sitting and maybe the fox will stop\
  \ staring at you and go away. It\u2019s probably just stopped to drink from the\
  \ river. Right?\n \nWe are four in our group. T has returned to the cottage for\
  \ some lunch \u2013 a promise of chicken curry, dal and rice made by the skilled\
  \ hands of the caretaker. The caretaker moved here from Nepal just ten years ago\
  \ but he\u2019s local now, enough to be part of a vote bank. He doesn\u2019t say\
  \ and we don\u2019t talk politics. We\u2019ve come to these foothills in Uttarakhand\
  \ to get away from the noise and the weight of city life. It would be foolish to\
  \ upset the dynamic in our holiday home. Besides, our plans are for isolation and\
  \ a return to nature. We\u2019ve been dreaming of the trees and the hills, the open\
  \ skies, the force of pure air in our lungs. We aren\u2019t expecting a visit from\
  \ the four-legged. Incredibly, we\u2019ve forgotten about the wild.\n \nSo here\
  \ we are by the river on our second day, sitting on cane chairs we\u2019ve brought\
  \ from our cottage and dipping our feet in the water. Despite the rain yesterday,\
  \ today has opened up to blissful weather. The water is cool; the warmth of the\
  \ sun is just right. Upon close inspection, the pebbles beneath our feet take on\
  \ different shades we didn\u2019t see in the gloom sixteen hours before. From our\
  \ vantage point we can see five houses scattered across the length of the hill but\
  \ not a soul in sight. Various species of birds dip and fly around us. The area\
  \ is known for birding but we have come unprepared. We have no binoculars and no\
  \ knowledge of birds beyond a few. We are surrounded by what we term to be nature\
  \ but we know no names. I feel like I\u2019m under a dome of sky. It is spectacular.\
  \ We\u2019re lucky to have found this incredible, solitary place. All we can hear\
  \ is the soft babble of the river. All we can see is the fox paused mid-step, waiting\
  \ to spring. In this moment, we are stilled. It seems so natural yet so unreal.\
  \ \n\nWe turn to jokes. We whisper about how we had hoped to see aliens. We debate\
  \ over whether this moment is delusion and it\u2019s not a fox we see but an extraordinary\
  \ dog. When we fall silent, I berate myself over my decision to defer lunch. I could\
  \ have been safe, eating a pahadi-style meal right now. Instead I\u2019m here and\
  \ I\u2019m uncertain. I\u2019m only comforted by the fact that I\u2019ve got company,\
  \ even if we\u2019re bound together taking the path of least resistance. \n \nNow\
  \ is when we quietly give up. If the wild must attack, so be it. We chose to visit\
  \ a small and remote town. The masses cannot descend upon us in rescue. We have\
  \ contrived this surreal moment. For a few seconds, the unidentifiable fox-dog paces\
  \ before us. It\u2019s noting its environment and things in the distance; we are\
  \ just the foreground blurred out. We are in awe of how purposeful the creature\
  \ seems, how graceful \u2013 like we are watching a nature documentary in sharp\
  \ definition \u2013 when it slips away as suddenly as it had appeared. Just as easily\
  \ as we dismissed its kind to have been hunted down to the sanctuaries, it seemed\
  \ to dismiss us as city folk out of our depth. We are relieved and rib each other\
  \ about our silliness. Momentarily, we\u2019ve returned to our peace.\n \nIn an\
  \ unusual mood, V lies down on his back to look at the sky. I join him after a while\
  \ to watch the clouds break within a fringe of treetops. When T returns, we tell\
  \ him we saw a fox. He does not believe us."
