Text: "Hello! My name is Iva Hyseni, a jurist in the Supreme Court of Albania. One\
  \ day I decided to apply for an international Volunteering Camp in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\
  \ One day I received the email that I was accepted . Sincerely I was hopping for\
  \ this Camp, cause doing the same administrative thing every day is really a bad\
  \ monotony. \nIt was the first time for me, travelling so long and alone. I took\
  \ different buses in one day. \nMy itinerary was: \n1-Durres (my place of birth-Shkodra(\
  \ a city in the north of Albania) -the first bus (2 hours of travelling)\n2-Shkodra-Ulcinj\
  \ (a city in Montenegro)the second bus(1.5 hours of travelling)\n3- Ulcinj-Podgorica\
  \ (The capital of Montenegro)-the third bus(2 hours of travelling)\nI decided to\
  \ stop in Podgorica and to be hosted by a nice Montenegrin girl. During my short\
  \ stay there we talk together about our countries. She was really nice with me.\
  \ She prepared dishes for me and give me a stop till the Bus station. \nI started\
  \ my journey at 08 A.M from Podgorica to Sarajevo, the third bus. During my travel\
  \ I saw different people. I understood something that Slavic people were  calm but\
  \ very sad. I dint know about this feeling. The nature during my journey was really\
  \ magnificent. Trees, river, green everywhere. \nI was surprised about this greenness.\
  \ \nThe bus stopped at 4 P.M in Sarajevo. I was surrounded by bars and surprised\
  \ to know where it was Srebrenica. Why so far away from everything. Did I decided\
  \ well about this travel? I was OK, at my office, my land, my city near the beautiful\
  \ sea of Adriatic. \nI waited in Sarajevo 2 hours before stating my journey in Srebrenica.\
  \ I continued to have the idea that the people were a little bit rude and tall.-)\n\
  After 4 hours and asking several time to travelers, where it is Srebrenica, did\
  \ we arrived? I saw a hill white cemetery and a lot of people around the cemetery.\
  \ \nI said, what is this? This is not a city, a village. Why so many dead people?\
  \ Why so many people drinking and eating and around the cemetery? \nAt 8 P.M after\
  \ more than 24 hours travelling I arrived in the camp, surrounded by young people\
  \ from all over the world, and 2 floor houses (maybe 10 little villas). \nAfter\
  \ 1 day, that camp begin to entry in my heart. Helping people in the camp and in\
  \ the city of Srebrenica (in the cemetery, in the fields or poor people it was the\
  \ motif of everyday).\nWalking down to the cemetery with the history of 8500 male\
  \ dead from 0-100 years old in the war of 1995,  was emotionally destroying for\
  \ every person (part of the Camp) but not only them also a question of this could\
  \ happens in the XX century?  \nNothing in that city was changed. U can see clearly\
  \ the holes of the weapons in the house`s wall. \nI meet a lot of Bosnian in that\
  \ Camp. From 16-70 years old. I understood a lot of things. I changed the opinion\
  \ of viewing them like rude people. \nThey were good in heart and with a history\
  \ back to them spine.\nAfter 2 weeks I was in Love with that city, their history,\
  \ their pain.\nAnd after 2 years I can definitely say that was one of my best experience\
  \ in an unknown and non touristic city like Srebrenica. \nIt was a good combination\
  \ about : FRIENDSHIP-COMPASSION-VOLUNTEERING-HUMANITY. \n\nRegards!\n\n\nIva from\
  \ Albania."
