Text: "I did this once. I knew it was time to quit when I started crying as I drove\
  \ home Friday night knowing I would have to come back on Monday.\n\nI went home,\
  \ revised my resume, wrote my resignation letter and turned in my two weeks notice\
  \ first thing Monday. At the time I was single, with no other income and no savings\
  \ to speak of.\n\nI realized that no matter what I had to give up or do it couldn\u2019\
  t be any worse than the way I was feeling every day. The weight that was lifted\
  \ when I turned in my notice was the motivation I needed to get moving on finding\
  \ another job.\n\nI called and emailed everyone in my professional network and started\
  \ looking through the phone book for organizations where I thought I might want\
  \ to work and used my lunch times to call them. One of the organizations I called\
  \ just happened to be hiring for a job in my field (which by the way I had never\
  \ seen advertised anywhere).\n\nI applied, got the job and it started exactly one\
  \ month to the day after giving my notice. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that\
  \ I paid attention to how I really felt, had the faith in my abilities (which had\
  \ gotten me the dreaded job I was leaving in the first place) and taken a leap into\
  \ the great unknown I would have probably stayed until I collapsed, got fired or\
  \ something worse!\n\nNo job is worth your life or your sanity! That experience\
  \ taught me that living my life out of fear of the unknown is not really living\
  \ at all."
