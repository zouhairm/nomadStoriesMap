Text: "While on my 'Grand Tour' of Europe last summer, I encountered some difficulty\
  \ in getting to the Mycenaean site of Nestor's Palace from Pylos on a Sunday. I\
  \ met a young couple who accompanied me on my adventure after twenty minutes acquaintance\
  \ and gave 'Greek hospitality' new meaning.\nWhen we reached Homer's 'well-built\
  \ citadel of Neleus', we found out that tickets to enter cost the obscene price\
  \ of twelve euros. Angelica and Thanasis thought they would send me ahead while\
  \ they grabbed their credit card, or stood with the box office attendant and smoked\u2014\
  we encountered some communication issues at this point\u2014but they started explaining\
  \ to the attendant that I had come from Canada to do archaeological digs and see\
  \ the sites. He was moved in some way by their story, I suppose, of how I had against\
  \ all odds contrived to make it to Nestor\u2019s Palace, and he let all three of\
  \ us in for free (setting a precedent for many of the sites that I visited on my\
  \ own and leading me to the conclusion that the reason some of the ancient sites\
  \ are so expensive is in fact this generosity), saying, \u201COnly because you are\
  \ from Canada,\u201D which was fairly incomprehensible in context but was said with\
  \ a kind smile. \nThe site of Nestor\u2019s Palace\u2014a Mycenaean palace-state\
  \ destroyed around 1200 BCE\u2014is not nearly as physically impressive as the more\
  \ well-known site at Mycenae, the supposed palace of Agamemnon. It is of a basic\
  \ Mycenaean palace floor plan, with the most recognizable feature of the so-called\
  \ \u2018throne room\u2019 clearly delineated; there is a beautifully decorated bath\
  \ that is remarkably preserved; and jars upon broken jars set into the floors and\
  \ benches of what must have been a storeroom. Less obvious to the casual visitor\
  \ is the incredible sewage system, which would have provided heated water to the\
  \ baths of the wealthy inhabitants and whisked away waste in separate piping structures.\
  \ There is a one-room museum on site that contains information about the Mycenaean\
  \ civilization and a few more valuable finds. The palace is an active archaeological\
  \ site with a very tall and wide tent over it and a raised walkway for visitors.\
  \ We were the only tourists and the crew had already finished for the season at\
  \ this time in September, so we were alone. Despite my excitement at finally seeing\
  \ a Mycenaean palace and its Homeric connection, even I was a little underwhelmed\
  \ on behalf of my guests. We spent around forty-five minutes at Neleus\u2019 citadel\
  \ all told, as I tried to explain what was so exciting about seeing a floor with\
  \ three-foot walls around it to Angelica and Thanasis.\nNow it was time to make\
  \ our way to the beach. Voidokilia is a magical beach among many incredible seafronts\
  \ in Greece. It has the pale, soft sand and clear turquoise water typical of most\
  \ of the beaches on the Ionian and Aegean seas, but it is shaped in a semicircle,\
  \ perfectly cut like someone took a hole-punch to the coast edge. The water is shallow\
  \ and moves with only gentle waves, since a natural harbour is formed by tall cliffs\
  \ that guard the route out to the Ionian sea. It is postulated that this is the\
  \ Homeric site of  \u201Csandy Pylos\u201D. We stayed here for the greater part\
  \ of the afternoon and into the evening: Angelica and Thanasis dozing in the sun\
  \ while I paddled about. At one point I decided to climb up the sandy hill of one\
  \ of the cliffs to try to get a good picture of the curve of the beach. I got my\
  \ picture halfway up but wanted to look out from the top, so I continued up. From\
  \ the crest of the hill all I could see was the wine-dark sea, stretching out past\
  \ the horizon. I remembered that this was one of the westernmost parts of the Peloponnesos\
  \ so that straight ahead of me there was no more land for many kilometres; I was\
  \ standing on the edge of Greece.\nWe parted late that night, adding each other\
  \ on Facebook. Angelica and Thanasis insisted on getting me to promise that when\
  \ I return to Pylos I will stay with them."
