Text: "How an Indian women supposed to walk, talk or wear ? \nGetting into the roots\
  \ of India, from Metropolitan cities like Delhi, Mumbai to the villages of Punjab,\
  \ Bihar. Be it North, East, West or South India, our country is women centric. \n\
  Don't believe this ? \nEach morning starts with a handmade paranthas with a dallop\
  \ of butter over it by our mother. \nHusband's day doesnt start without the FIFO\
  \ (first in , first out) arrangements done by his wife, as soon as he comes out\
  \ of washroom. \nFamily doesn't start it's day without the handmade chai from the\
  \ daughter in law.\nWhat's more precious is the fact that each morning we pray in\
  \ front of our goddess to empower us, because we know that the strength comes from\
  \ her. \nStill, some part of our nation doesn't want to agree to this. They would\
  \ keep Navratri Fast (on the name of Goddess) but not treat the females in their\
  \ life right.\nWhy is this so? \n If a women secures better position, better wage-\
  \ it is certainly the evil deeds of a lady to reach that position than her hardwork,\
  \ dedication and aim to achieve more. \nIf a women is independent, she is not the\
  \ sanskari enough to fit the family. \nIf she wears makeup before marriage, its\
  \ inappropriate. If she doesn't wear makeup after marriage, it's inappropriate.\
  \ \nWho creates such rules in the society? Why every rule is women centric and not\
  \ human centric. \n\nIts the nation that needs an awakening bell to understand that\
  \ the world doesn't need hatred in various forms. Love mankind, understand and respect\
  \ in every form and receive much love in return."
