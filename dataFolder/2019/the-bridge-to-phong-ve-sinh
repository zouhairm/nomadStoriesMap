Text: "For weeks, I daydreamed of gliding through the clouds across Da Nang's majestic\
  \ Golden Bridge. But, the crux of traveling with mates is the necessity of compromise,\
  \ bound to facilitate some degree of resentment when desires aren\u2019t fulfilled.\n\
  \nAnd so, I found myself in the bustling town of H\u1ED9i An instead. The heat antagonized\
  \ my already foul mood. I was convinced that the lanterns adorning the streets were\
  \ miniature suns, standing at attention to their master at high noon. \u201CI bet\
  \ the mountains are cool and misty.\u201D I whined. \u201CNo point in sulking now,\
  \ so let\u2019s hit the bars!\u201D my mate chimed. \u201CI\u2019m going to the\
  \ bathroom,\u201D I countered monotonously, emphasizing my obvious dissatisfaction.\
  \ \n\nNow would be a good time to clue you in on my chronic colon disease. That\u2019\
  s all the detail needed to understand that when I\u2019ve got to go, I\u2019ve really\
  \ got to go. So, we hopped from restaurant to restaurant, inquiring. Just when I\
  \ started to believe it was a futile effort, my mate offered her first token of\
  \ redemption, pointing out a \u201CWC\u201D sign across the river. \n\nMid-stride\
  \ onto a small, rickety bridge, I felt an urgent tap on my shoulder. I turned to\
  \ find six wide, beaming grins, followed by multiple cell phones hovering in my\
  \ face. Oh boy. \n\nThis trek to the restroom would unfold into a tale far more\
  \ amusing than gliding across the sky in the hands of God would have been.\n\nThis\
  \ wasn't the first time my afro had caused a scene in Asia. I often wanted to explain\
  \ that I was not a celebrity, but learned soon enough that no one cared. They had\
  \ never seen someone who looked like me, and only wished to document the moment.\
  \ I was happy to make their day.\n\nFirst, a father and his baby posed for a shot,\
  \ followed by the mother and the baby, then both parents with the baby, then the\
  \ grandmother, then all the others, followed by a hectic mashup of combinations.\n\
  \nOver the commotion, I spotted my mate recording the scene. \u201CI need to go\
  \ now,\u201D I mouthed to her. My desperation was met with hysterical laughter.\
  \ \n\nTwo more families approached with the same urgency. Just twenty meters and\
  \ about fifteen delighted faces stood between me and much needed relief. But I could\
  \ not bring myself to dampen their joy, nor was I sure of how to decline in a manner\
  \ that would translate politely. So, my bowels would have to wait. Hopefully. \n\
  \nAs the minutes passed, I inched closer to the end of the bridge. A teenage girl\
  \ burst into tears as she hugged me delicately. This amount of attention was unlike\
  \ anything I\u2019d experienced. It made me happy and confused all at once, not\
  \ dissimilar to their apparent emotions towards me. I grew increasingly overwhelmed,\
  \ despite wanting to enjoy the moment. \n\nIn the midst of the frenzy, my body decided,\
  \ without my consent, to tear away from the crowd abruptly. I charged for the restroom.\
  \ \n\nOne of two attendants lit up at the sight of me sprinting into her workplace.\
  \ I immediately recognized that I wasn\u2019t in the clear just yet. She popped\
  \ up from her chair, and set down the cash she was counting. \u201CCan I use be\
  \ bathroom please?\u201D I begged. \u201CYes, of course!\u201D In the same beat,\
  \ I bolted towards the first stall. \u201CI take a picture with you.\u201D It wasn\u2019\
  t a question. What\u2019s one more? I thought. I\u2019m not too sure I had a choice\
  \ anyway. She\u2019s small but mighty. \n\nNo angle seemed to satisfy her, so with\
  \ a firm tug, she pulled me outside to find better lighting. Kissy face. Peace sign.\
  \ She directed the shoot like a pro before running off to flaunt the souvenirs to\
  \ friends nearby. \n\n\u201CSo, I can use the bathroom for free then?\u201D I joke\
  \ with the other attendant. \u201C20,000 dong\u201D she demands, stone faced. I\
  \ take a moment to appreciate her contrarian demeanor; a breath of fresh air. \n\
  \nI muster 10,000 dong; all the cash I have. \"Are you kidding me,\" I fume, before\
  \ my mate hands me the toll I need to complete my journey over the the bridge to\
  \ Ph\xF2ng V\u1EC7 Sinh."
