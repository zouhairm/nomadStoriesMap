Text: "Gliding through a gauzy landscape, mist not yet burnt off the morning, I peer\
  \ over the side of the john-boat. The water is like a black window that reflects\
  \ my face yet allows me to see life below the surface. In case we come across one\
  \ of the hundreds of gators whose home this is, and who have not invited us, I keep\
  \ my hands inside the boat. \n\nAs we move further into the swamp, the sun begins\
  \ to reach the water. Surrounding us are trees that look as if they rose from an\
  \ ancient sea of wild giant corals. They are weighted with Spanish moss and are\
  \ probably full of spiders. As far as I can see, the water is still, nothing seems\
  \ to be moving. Adventuring on, the day gets hotter and our boat has no shade. Our\
  \ cooler full of icy drinks will keep us from turning back.\n\nThe Okefenokee Swamp,\
  \ lying deep at the southeastern base of Georgia along the Florida state line, is\
  \ a singular place. A place this pristine that still exists in the world, especially\
  \ in the United States, is sublime. There are few places in the country that are\
  \ so untouched and wild. This is not a place that offers much welcome for people.\
  \ When you venture into the swamp, you enter a strange world that demands your respect.\n\
  \nThe Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge, which encompasses the swamp, is one of\
  \ the largest freshwater ecosystems on the planet. What a refuge it is. Amphibians,\
  \ reptiles, fish, bear, deer, birds, wild turkeys, insects and the precious long-leaf\
  \ pines* all thrive here unbothered by humankind. \n\nThe swamp itself is the mother\
  \ of both the Suwanee and the St. Marys rivers. The famous Suwanee meanders through\
  \ Florida to the Gulf of Mexico while the St. Marys roams to the Atlantic Ocean.\
  \ \n\nThe word \u201COkefenokee\u201D comes from a Creek Indian word meaning \u201C\
  Land of Trembling Earth.\u201D The trembling earth is made up of unsteady peat deposits\
  \ that cover much of the swamp, and also give the water its tea or amber color.\
  \ \n\nFrom the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service:\nThe Okefenokee National Wildlife\
  \ Refuge is like no other place on earth, where natural beauty and wilderness prevail.\
  \  The vision for Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge is to protect and enhance\
  \ wildlife and its habitat, ensure integrity of the ecological system, and embrace\
  \ the grandeur, mystery, and cultural heritage that lead to an enrichment of the\
  \ human spirit.\nExperiencing the largest swamp in North America is profoundly moving.\
  \ Let 2019 be the year you connect with nature in a new way. Immerse yourself into\
  \ the remarkable corners of our planet. Nature gives on its own terms, but it gives\
  \ freely everything it has.\n\nTo learn more and to plan your trip, go to: https://www.fws.gov/refuge/okefenokee/.\
  \ The site includes information about accommodations, recreation, park information,\
  \ news and events. For those not wanting to venture personally into the swamp\u2019\
  s mysteries, visit the Owl\u2019s Roost Tower 360-degree virtual camera or the Park\
  \ livestream.\n\nTips: \n\u2022\tDecide the time of the year for your visit. The\
  \ swamp is magnificent in every season but be aware of how it changes and be prepared.\
  \ Rescues in such wild areas can be complicated.\n\u2022\tBring plenty of water,\
  \ sunscreen, bug spray and a hat. Be prepared with the proper clothing and shoes.\n\
  \u2022\tHave an open and curious mind.\n\nNote: Longleaf pine forests used to cover\
  \ 90 million acres of the United States, once the greatest forest on earth. Today,\
  \ only 3 percent remains so spend some time with these native trees."
