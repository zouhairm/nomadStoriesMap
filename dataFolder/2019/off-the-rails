Text: "My mother always told me to explore one's own country, before stepping out\
  \ into the world.  Coming from Canada, it's tough to traverse all of its untamed\
  \ surfaces. Luckily for me, the Canadian train company Via rail offered to citizens\
  \ from the age of 18-25, the chance to ride across the country for the month of\
  \ July. This coveted ticket cost 150 Canadian dollars and its purpose was to commemorate\
  \ Canada's 150th anniversary.  Immediately, my travel companions and I hopped on\
  \ board.  \n\nAfter several hours of phone calls, relentless emails and soothing\
  \ elevator on-hold music, we secured four tickets to scavenge the great Canadian\
  \ railroad.  The volume of interest generated was insurmountable for the company\
  \ and the train carts were rapidly filled to the overhead compartments with young\
  \ freighthoppers. \n\nFor a group of twenty-year-olds, this was like the hatchlings\
  \ first flight from the nest.  Excitement and wanderlust coursed through our veins\
  \ as we approached the underwhelming hut facing the train tracks in the heart of\
  \ the rural northern Canadian town's industrial park.  As dawn approaches, our enthusiasm\
  \ is at its peak. Eyes baggy from lack of slumber, we jumped on board the passenger\
  \ vessel like it was the train to Hogwarts, and we headed west in search of gold.\
  \  \n\nOur first destination was the scenic town of Banff, in the heart of the northern\
  \ rocky mountains.  Hiking the hazardous rocky top of Pharaoh's peak was our goal.\
  \  Three days later was our expected time of arrival. We were still 3 moons away\
  \ from reaching our target.  \n\nAfter an hour, desperation loomed over us. The\
  \ thought of three full days on this mechanical bastille covering three Canadian\
  \ provinces and close to three thousand kilometers ( 1864.114 miles) crushed our\
  \ spirits. What happened next, caught us off guard. \n\nAs we gazed towards Lake\
  \ Superior's glistening whitecaps and rolled through the repetitive lush Boreal\
  \ forest of North-Western Ontario, there was a mutual unspoken agreement within\
  \ the confines of the train.  If we were to be stuck in here, we would enjoy our\
  \ time. \n\nThese three days turned into an adult summer camp on rails.  The comradery\
  \ between young passengers and the Via rail crew was like something only seen in\
  \ movies.  Stops were made in small secluded railroad communities like Hornepayne.\
  \  The large group of strangers turned into traveling companions rushed towards\
  \ the local watering holes to reward their relentless patience with a cold brewed\
  \ beverage.  We would return to the vehicle bearing alcoholic souvenirs from our\
  \ short one hour visits to these boondocks.  \n\nAt night, we would sneak over to\
  \ the complimentary glass bubble train cart.  This wagon was equipped with heavily\
  \ cushioned seats and a glass casing roof that pierced through the night sky.  The\
  \ wagon was raised slightly above the rest, giving a scenic view of the night sky,\
  \ untouched by the detrimental light pollution. Also visible was the tail of the\
  \ train, confidently winding through the evening.  The intoxicating sounds of the\
  \ train whistle, the laughter of the young new friends and a poor rendition of the\
  \ Canadian national anthem serenades us through the night. \n\nThe warm sun rays\
  \ beating down on our faces wakes us up for another day on the rails.  To my surprise,\
  \ a sea of golden grain fields dominates the landscape. We were in the Canadian\
  \ prairies.  There's an old saying that says, if you lose your dog in the prairies,\
  \ you can watch him run away for a day. Let's just say the rumors are true. \n\n\
  Our clan sets up for another evening in the dome, when the train is forced to stop\
  \ for the night.  Our disappointment was brief.  The night sky was painted by a\
  \ fantastic thunderstorm.  Lightning was striking at an incredible rate, using the\
  \ flatlands as its canvas.  It was a spectacular and memorable light show that left\
  \ everyone in the glass bubble in complete disbelief.\n\nBefore my train adventure,\
  \ if I could skip the travel and arrive at the destination, I would of.  No longer,\
  \ I've learned that the journey can be more enjoyable than the destination.  This\
  \ ride was off the rails."
