Text: "\u201CBe ready,\u201D she told me.\u201D  \u201CReady?\u201D I asked. \u201C\
  Like a cat\u201D, she said. \u201CWhen I say now, we go, we run.\u201D \n\nI had\
  \ no idea what she was talking about or where we were running. \n\nWe were in India\
  \ at the Khumba Mela, the Hindu festival that draws millions of pilgrims to bath\
  \ in a holy river, it is one of the world\u2019s largest congregation of religious\
  \ pilgrims. It\u2019s so large it can be seen from space.\n\nWe had our backs against\
  \ the wall, my hand holding tight to my new Spanish friend, Asha, on tip toes, waiting\
  \ to be ready. As I looked around all I could see were masses of people, colorful,\
  \ happy, singing people. There was an energy of excitement in the air, as the marigold\
  \ flowers descended onto our heads. \n\nThe bright orange robes of my Guru along\
  \ with his lotus feet became visible to me in the distance as he began his descent\
  \ from the chariot he was riding during the procession towards the river.\n \n\u201C\
  Now!\u201D she yelled. And we were running. We were running so fast my shoeless\
  \ feet barely touched the ground. Holding my Spanish friend\u2019s hand for dear\
  \ life we were jumping over obstacles as I struggled not to fall over my sari. \n\
  \ \n\u201CMy sari,\u201D I called out. \u201CForget your sari, now is for living,\u201D\
  \ she yelled back as we flew through the crowds. \n \nSuddenly we were at the edge\
  \ of the river, jammed with thousands of people. I realized we were running into\
  \ the river I shouted, \u201CNo, I do not want to get in the river.\u201D I was\
  \ engulfed in fear. \u201CThis is all maya,\u201D she yelled back. \u201CYou do\
  \ want to get in the river.\u201D\n\nAccording to maya this was not real, my outer\
  \ reality was just an illusion and the illusion had me so engulfed in fear I was\
  \ paralyzed, not able to move. I knew I had to move forward and leap into the river,\
  \ it was the only place to go, yet I could not move. The crowds of people were pushing\
  \ us more and more forward, their eagerness to get into the river overcoming any\
  \ boundaries. My inner reality began to pray and chant and focus on my Guru, that\
  \ was the message I had received and I needed to focus my mind, to move beyond the\
  \ fear, to be able to physically move my body. \nThis was all happening so quickly,\
  \ everything around me was pushing me to take that leap of faith into the holy river.\n\
  \ \nAt that moment Asha pulled me into the holy river, that\u2019s it I thought,\
  \ I\u2019m going to drown. I became submerged in the water, trying to keep my head\
  \ above the water.\n \nThoughts of my nude underwear were long gone as I struggled\
  \ to stay afloat. I could see my Guru in the water ahead of us as I desperately\
  \ grabbed hold of the nearest man to prevent myself from drowning. I knew what I\
  \ was experiencing was magical yet I was terrified.\n\n I was in the holy river\
  \ at the Kumbh Mela with my Guru and masses of people. People around me were joyfully\
  \ swimming and splashing around in the river, bringing their heads under the water\
  \ and having so much fun. I was still trying to stay alive. My feet did not reach\
  \ the bottom of the river until we reached the steps to climb out. I am not sure\
  \ if I swam or just floated to the steps.\n\n Relief and lightness ran through my\
  \ body and mind as I climbed out of the river. Even though I was soaking wet I felt\
  \ so much lighter.\n\nFaith had got me this far, faith in my Guru, and faith in\
  \ my Spanish friend and most importantly faith in myself, embarking on this exciting\
  \ journey to India.\n \nFeeling blessed to be so alive we danced and sang our way\
  \ back to our camp, with thousands of people, grateful that according to Hindu tradition,\
  \ our karma had been cleansed for many lifetimes."
