Text: "If there's anything I learned on my first journey to Ireland, it's this: the\
  \ Irish are storytellers to their very core. Should you cross their path even in\
  \ the smallest way, you\u2019ll be a tick on their daily ledger as they unload a\
  \ story or two.  They\u2019ve got story running through their veins.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s understandable.  The island\u2019s history is ancient, one era one-upping the\
  \ next, comedy bubbling up through tragedy like the mahogany waves of Guinness rising\
  \ in a pint glass after the second pour.  \n\nTraveling as a party of four, our\
  \ scrappy crew of loud Americans full of swagger and wanderlust, we soaked in every\
  \ narrative and loved every story-telling minute.  \n\nFirst was Hugh.  Poor Hugh.\
  \ Our electric bike tour guide through Dublin, he tried to tell us all about Dublin\
  \ castle and St. Patrick\u2019s church, about freedom fighters and more and more\
  \ but we just mostly looked at him sideways through our glassy jet lagged eyes.\
  \  \n\nHaving recovered a bit the next day, we could listen more attentively to\
  \ the jolly Waterford shop owner who befriended us as we gawked at the glassblowing\
  \ artisans in action, heating, banging, twirling their art- stories in glass.  \n\
  \nOur more reserved but kind hearted driver on the Dingle peninsula was the kind\
  \ of local who spoke Irish as his primary language and was rife with intrigue. \
  \ It was at this point that we picked up on the endearing way the Irish use the\
  \ word \u201Cye\" to refer to a group. We were mostly too terrified to listen as\
  \ he drove like a bat out of hell through the single laned and twisting backroads\
  \ in the black of night, but then again his stories may have been what helped us\
  \ through make it through the white knuckled moments of that drive.  \n\nWe didn\u2019\
  t necessarily speak to any locals at the Cliff of Moher- we were too busy picking\
  \ our jaws off the ground- but a couple of local men told their stories without\
  \ words- the accordion player with his wooden shoe for tips and the neon-clad bird\
  \ feeding policeman most certainly more concerned about his aviary friends than\
  \ anything having to do with the law.  \n\nIn Galway, dear Galway, John of the Irish\
  \ Food Trail welcomed us with stories over  Irish stews, black pudding croquets,\
  \ fish and chips, local whiskeys and beer tastings. It was John who told us (more\
  \ than once) that the Irish don\u2019t like the truth to get in the way of a good\
  \ story.    \n\nFrom there it was off to the King\u2019s Head Pub to listen to four\
  \ young musicians who crafted their stories with foot stomps, guitar strings, fiddle\
  \ rifts, and accordion (squeeze box?) tunes, the melodies wrapping their way around\
  \ each other reminiscent of a visit to an Irish homestead in the sixteenth century.\
  \  Their stories were visceral and entrancing, a true wonder from such young souls.\
  \  \n\nMaybe the most shocking and entertaining stories came from Tommy at Sean\u2019\
  s Bar in Athlone, the oldest pub in Ireland boasting 1,100 years of service.  Tommy\
  \ pulled up a chair as soon as he saw us settle in and told us all kinds of personal\
  \ stories, the most notable of which was the one about a horrible case of dysentery\
  \ he acquired in Thailand after smoking a bit of opium and the ensuing plane ride\
  \ during which he sat between two nuns while \u201Csqueezing his arse cheeks together\
  \ the whole time.\u201D  He was as colorful as the language he used, preferring\
  \ the f word to all others.  \n\nBut above all others, the most touching Irish storyteller\
  \ was the youngest.  Shortly after Dublin, we stopped over in Lismore to visit a\
  \ friend and meet her family.  We roamed around some old castle ruins and had a\
  \ bit of craic (fun) visiting and as we walked on little 2-year-old Mia looked up\
  \ at me while holding her mom\u2019s hand.  With a pacifier dangling from her mouth,\
  \ she told the sweetest three word story there is to tell.  \n\n\u201CYou\u2019\
  re my sister,\u201D she declared, pointing my way.  \n\nYep, it\u2019s in their\
  \ blood alright.  Even blonde whisped Mia in her little Mary Jane shoes got me with\
  \ that one. \n\nBrilliant."
