Text: "A breadcrumb trail of skulls studs the forest as we labour North. Each beckons\
  \ a reliving of the previous evening, where a goat hangs dead in the dark. Pearly\
  \ skin is tethered taut to the swollen canopy of a ger, scuffed hooves still outstretched,\
  \ stubbed into the gravel.\n\nMy guide, Amaal, swivels on his horse periodically\
  \ to ask the same question. No simple task, I note, as my own would buck and bolt\
  \ at a fluttering of fabric in its periphery. His deftness is unsurprising, however;\
  \ it is said \u2018A Mongol without a horse is like a bird without wings\u2019.\
  \ Perched upon his companion\u2019s cushioned back, he calls: \u2018OK, yes?\u2019\
  . His favourite and third-most used European word - \u2018spaghetti\u2019 \u2013\
  \ is yet to make an appearance. \n\nI wonder each time what has spurred the question.\
  \ Do I look disturbed? Or is it for his benefit, wishing to snap the tightening\
  \ band of quiet, as juddering hooves progress from clanging rocks to muffling moss,\
  \ purchasing distance from a freckling of gers \u2013 Mongolian yurts - where we\u2019\
  d stopped for lunch. A family offered mutton dumplings, soft and bitter as peel,\
  \ which were slurped as loudly as possible \u2013 a traditional mark of politeness.\n\
  \nMy journey to this point had been punctuated by clutter, clobber, noise. An airport\
  \ taxi driver with a wince-inducing cough delivered me into Ulaanbaatar: a grey\
  \ and car-choked contradiction between Soviet encroachment and a disorganised lunge\
  \ at modernisation. In the dizzyingly wide western steppes, children shrieked at\
  \ the fun of riding a yak or racing a sheep. The father of a local family spluttered\
  \ a response from his stationary truck daily, mimicking the drum of a rare nearby\
  \ road. Nights spent on full buses eventually landed me in Murun: the start of my\
  \ ascent to the country\u2019s uppermost fringe.\n\nThe force coaxing me to tiptoe\
  \ Siberia\u2019s invisible border was desire for isolation. Or rather, a hunt for\
  \ the least known territory on earth: silence. After years of quenching a thirst\
  \ to cram in as much sound and energy as possible, I\u2019d forgotten this space\
  \ existed. Continuous racket, weekend plans, deadlines \u2013 all suddenly seemed\
  \ overbearing. \n\nInversely, for the nearly 40% of Outer Mongolians who still maintain\
  \ the hardy nomadic lives guarded since the time of Genghis Khan, they exist as\
  \ though refreshingly exempt to world change. Their lives are entwined with calm\
  \ simplicity; hospitality, landscape and livestock are unwavering cultural pillars.\
  \ Despite increasing land pressure from commercial mining, the steppes still cloak\
  \ the earth\u2019s least densely populated non-island country. None of its people\
  \ are more isolated than the few hundred Tsaatan: reindeer herders of the very north.\
  \ Driven to the Taiga region of Mongolia from tense 1930s Soviet Russia, they relocate\
  \ their herds 7-8 times a year, prevailing in semi-subsistence by hunting and producing\
  \ dairy.\n\nA final turn out of the trees, and the horses tramp through soft bushes\
  \ of russet, purple and burnt yellow, tight and daubed as though painted with cotton\
  \ wool. The skulls are suddenly exposed as a false foreboding. Two tipis nestle\
  \ up a slope, pairs of solar panels the only clue of the century. Our hosts, a young\
  \ family of five, watch us approach. They accept our gift, a metal jerry of airag\
  \ \u2013 smooth, coveted horse milk \u2013 with thanks. Noiselessly, they reciprocate,\
  \ fishing a handful of fresh pine nuts from a sack. I drop a few into my pocket\
  \ \u2013 silken stowaways for later.\n\nIntroductions over, and with an impenetrable\
  \ language barrier, I select a rock to sit on and watch the dozens of velvety reindeer\
  \ champ the ground. It feels almost ceremonious, this walk to the hard-grey stool\
  \ where I plan to drink in the quiet. I wonder how, when they settle in deep forest\
  \ for the coming winter, they will find a place as still and perfect as this. But\
  \ of course, the lifestyle nurtures calmness wherever they go. Struck by the thought,\
  \ I reflect perhaps my search for this great unknown, this silent space, has been\
  \ misguided. Extreme, even.  As we peel off on the horses two days later, I am convinced:\
  \ silence is not always a territory, but a state of thoughts, actions and pace.\
  \ But perhaps I needed extreme measures to rediscover it."
