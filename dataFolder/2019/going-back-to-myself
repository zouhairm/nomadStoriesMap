Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find...\n\n\nMyself.\n\n\n\tThis story is about me.\
  \ But it could be about you, really. It\u2019s the story of a girl and a summer,\
  \ and some hundreds of faces and stories in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\
  \ It is actually, an ongoing story, as it has never ended and I might have left\
  \ a little piece of me back in a notebook on Ipanema Beach. It shows you how we\
  \ can leave empty, in pieces, all alone, by ourselves, and come back as glorious\
  \ warriors and sailors and painters of feelings we\u2019ve collected on our way.\
  \ \n\tI have left my hectic London on the 4th of July. I was wearing quite a warm\
  \ jacket, as it might as well rain- with London- you never know. What I was doing\
  \ materialised in my mind only 12 hours later, when Rio de Janeiro\u2019 appeared\
  \ on the little screen attached to the airplane chair. Attention: moments of utmost\
  \ panic and tremendous agitation to follow!  \u2018\u2018Oh my God, what am I actually\
  \ doing? I don\u2019t know anyone. How am I even gonna see any of these things,\
  \ when there\u2019s no one to show me around? What were you actually thinking about,\
  \ Andra?\u2019 - I was asking myself. Landing on the other side of the planet, in\
  \ a country where no one knows you can, indeed, generate all sorts of bothersome\
  \ and perturbing thoughts. So little I knew, and how could I have imagined that\
  \ only 24 hours later I would find myself running carefree, on Ipanema beach with\
  \ Jose and Maria and Felipe Luiz? 25 days I have spent in Rio, and 25 days I have\
  \ learned to love myself a bit more, by hearing people\u2019s stories and seeing\
  \ such a mesmerising, diversified world. A world now so different, from what I could\
  \ ever see before.\n\tRio de Janeiro is a peculiar city. It merges rich and poor,\
  \ present and past, urbanisation and late democratisation in a unique epicenter\
  \ of solidarity and patriotism. It merges culture and people, saudade and samba,\
  \ and so many unknown stories; stories that no one could hear because people have\
  \ feeble voices when they seem to be invisible on the agenda of their corrupt politicians\
  \ and interest groups. When you are there, it seems like there is no time and space,\
  \ and all is a dream and you are part of a postcard yourself. For real, some of\
  \ the pictures really do look unreal! At times, it feels like you could almost hear\
  \ Corcovado and Bossa Nova and the guitar strings through the paper. It feels like\
  \ a never-ending hot summer,  a summer in which you would like to stay, forever.\
  \ That is perhaps, what I felt when after long days of gloomy rain, and judgment\
  \ and pain, I finally found myself crying tears...of joy. I could not understand,\
  \ at first, why and what was going on with myself? But maybe that water and the\
  \ sun, and that particular scent in the air activated that part of my brain that\
  \ made me feel real. \n\tMaybe it takes a lot of gut to make a big step and throw\
  \ yourself in the world. Maybe, I was a little bit scared when on top of the Sugarloaf\
  \ Mountain I could see the whole world becoming so small under my feet, as I was\
  \ standing high in the air. But I would do it, for sure, again and again. Because\
  \ it finds me in tears, now that I write it, and it makes me feel like I belong\
  \ to the world a little bit more. Like Rio is now home, and I could go back and\
  \ feel like I have never left. I could find all the people waiting for me, and together\
  \ we would start from where we last said \u2018Goodbye\u2019. \n\tI hope that this\
  \ short story awakened your desire to travel, and I invite you, my curious reader,\
  \ to open that cupboard and clean all the dust from that old suitcase you have.\
  \ Throw just a few objects in there and go away. Who knows, maybe you will find\
  \ others to join your journey for meaning, on your way."
