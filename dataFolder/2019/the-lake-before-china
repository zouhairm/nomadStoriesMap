Text: "It is no more a hidden fact that India and Pakistan have never shared a friendly\
  \ relationship. Growing up as an Indian, the fact of \u201CJammu and Kashmir issue\u201D\
  \ was nothing new to me. Pakistan wants Kashmir, and so do India. But beyond all\
  \ that lies a peaceful valley of Ladakh, serene and beautiful, but most importantly,\
  \ the quietest place in the circumstances of chaos. Bare mountains covered the hurtful\
  \ truth of the bullets and blood splattering world.\n\nThe deficient amount of trees,\
  \ did not stop the humans to stay in the place. It would take a day or two for people\
  \ like us, the ones from plain to start walking and exploring things. I stood there\
  \ on the roof of a small building, taking as much as was possible to take. Still\
  \ my wish to explore and breath were insufficient. The owner of the house called\
  \ me up for the lunch. She made a special authentic dish called \u2018thukpa\u2019\
  . Being a vegetarian was an issue, so I quietly removed all the unwanted pieces\
  \ of meat and ate quietly. No, growing up eating a regular Indian meal, this won\u2019\
  t fill my appetite. A strange world it is, same nation but so much different, divided\
  \ by distance.\n\nThat day, we were supposed to go to Pangong Lake just to experience\
  \ the view and china border. As we get on the cab, we found two amazing humans who\
  \ would later turn out amazing companions. The silent road journey was inconvenient\
  \ for all of us so I escape to the beautiful view outside. Children giggling on\
  \ their way back to school. A young woman crying on the sides. Some travellers trekking\
  \ over the unknown lanes. That long journey took us through different dimensions\
  \ of the city. A journey where we saw mountain plants with ripped fruits. One, where\
  \ there was a snowfall, every twenty minutes. One where there were just stones on\
  \ all the sides.\n\nSo much to offer yet too less time to take. I took my camera\
  \ and grab photos like any other tourist. But this journey was not like any other\
  \ one, something was about to change. I was about to birth the traveller in me.\
  \ The one with curiosity. The one with the want to explore. And the one with guts\
  \ to move through all the damaging parts of the journey.\n\nWhile our way back,\
  \ a landslide happened. The temperature was twenty degree Celsius. With nothing\
  \ to eat and take shelter at, we were stuck inside our cab. Our body was freezing\
  \ and we were trying our level best to get out of the place. It was the same place\
  \ where the snow would fall every twenty minutes and then would disappear. A heavenly\
  \ site with deadly life. \n In this, one of my fellow passengers got \u2018panicked\u2019\
  \ and it took all of our feared souls to fake the hero within, to ignite the courage\
  \ within her heart. We received the help of the locals who were habitual to the\
  \ natural calamities. Funnily, anything can be normalised if it happens constantly.\n\
  \nWe all carved our way through the tunnels made by the locals. It was new and was\
  \ recently made. As we walked, there came a time, where it was just a narrow path\
  \ along the frightening height. One step wrong and the life ends. Small and simple\
  \ step we took with the courage in our hearts, it finished at the road that led\
  \ us back to our path. It took us two more hours to get back to our hotel.\n\nIn\
  \ that small moment, I tasted the sweetness of adventure. Today looking back, it\
  \ was one of those moments that made me produce the inner traveller inside me.\n\
  \nThe story doesn\u2019t end here. After few days when in Delhi, I receive a friend\
  \ request of Razia Ahmed, the panicked girl. Location: Lahore, Pakistan. My breath\
  \ took a skip. She was the best human I had come across. She was a traveller who\
  \ knew no bound and wasn\u2019t hesitating in being imperfect."
