Text: "ARMED VIOLENCE,AFRICANS MIGRATION TO EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE A CANCER FOR DEVELOPMENT\
  \ IN AFRICA\n By Kennedy Obara\n\nOUTLINE  OF MY WRITING INTEREST:\n\nArmed violence,\
  \ Africans migration to European countries and conflicts are a cancer for development\
  \ in Africa and will always be a source of news and good copy for journalists everywhere;\
  \ but whenever journalists write about conflicts they probably make situations worse\
  \ rather than reverse. Wars, bloodshed and death are the very substances which dominate\
  \ front pages and news bulletins in both print and electronic media.\n\nFor as long\
  \ as conflicts and migration make an important part of human interest stories, they\
  \ will continue to dominate both space and time in all the news media. The questions\
  \ many journalism scholars keep asking on the coverage of conflicts are many and\
  \ complicated such that in this days and age they have formed major topics in journalism\
  \ classes and workshops.\n\nIs there, for example, a \u201Cpositive and negative\u201D\
  \ way of covering conflicts? Could Journalists covering wars make the combatants\
  \ pick up more arms than look for peaceful solutions to their problems? Are there\
  \ specialist in the profession who could claim to be experts in the coverage of\
  \ conflicts? What should journalists look for when covering peace efforts after\
  \ or even during conflicts? The answers to all this question will come up during\
  \ my trip to Netherlands on a fact finding mission since its among the hub of African\
  \ migrants looking for greener pasture.my investigation and interactions with prominent\
  \ interdisciplinary experts in the trauma and conflicts and with conversations with\
  \ my sources will assist me to come up with a well pitch which will be published\
  \ online, broadcast and printed as a true copy of reference to all those who value\
  \ life that there is a better way for journalists to cover conflicts,migration and\
  \ health related issues.\n\n \n\nMy interactions with my sources both in Kenya and\
  \ Netherlands will particularly highlight my pitch and guide to a successful final\
  \ story for publication.my approach will be based on how best we journalists can\
  \ assist  with building media capacity as that positive agent of peace and understanding.\
  \ There are those who believe that the style, language and presentation of ethnic\
  \ clashes should be discussed by professionals with a view to making practitioners\
  \ see the need to highlight positive and responsible journalism without hiding any\
  \ facts or muzzling the information.\n\nLastly with confidence, this will be a timely\
  \ travel fellowship for me and its my humble prayer that you will offer me the opportunity\
  \ to travel to Netherlands to followup this untold story which most journalists\
  \ have avoided and I will prove to you\n that I was your true choice during your\
  \ panel selection.\n\n RE:MY BIOGRAPHY.\n\nKENNEDY OBARA (KENYA)\n I am writing\
  \ to express my interest in the travel fellowship. I am a Kenya-based editor and\
  \ writer for camafricnews, the first and largest upcoming international media outlet.\
