Text: "The last week of July is when I had chosen to start my European adventure.\
  \ I\u2019d start in Berlin, a nice big city. It had reliable transit, many people\
  \ spoke English, and there was much to do. But from then on out, I had no plan.\
  \ This would later haunt me. The hostel I stayed at in Berlin came recommended through\
  \ friends. It boasted its own basement brewery and the world\u2019s only David Hasselhoff\
  \ museum. Berlin was quirky in that way. Europe had a record breaking heat wave\
  \ that summer but I found the warmth comforting. The hot air clung between the old\
  \ brown buildings and hung in the trees, no way to escape it except to wait until\
  \ sun down or sit in a park topless with a cold beer. The hostel room was spacious,\
  \ with large windows overlooking the busy streets of Rosenthal-Platz with nothing\
  \ but a small fan to relieve you of the heat. I found the best nights were those\
  \ spent riding the U Bahn, drinking local beers and  dancing in Berlin\u2019s techno\
  \ clubs till the early morning. 6am was the most still on Rosenthal-Platz. The city\
  \ was just barely beginning to open its eyes and the craziness of the day had yet\
  \ to take over. The streets were quiet and the clouds still pink. Trams and busses\
  \ still buzzed by but ever so softly as if respecting that this might just be the\
  \ most peaceful and coolest time of day. Berlin was easy. The unknown had yet to\
  \ be conquered though and after a week of day drinking in parks and dancing all\
  \ night, I was ready to do what I had came to Europe for. I came for adventure.\
  \ I came for a challenge. I traded in the beaches for castles. \n\tI had no real\
  \ plan, only a generalized direction of where I was heading. I decided to go east,\
  \ to Poland. I\u2019d head to Krakow, a historical southern Polish town near the\
  \ border of Czech Republic. I\u2019d catch an overnight bus from Berlin to Krakow.\
  \ I ran after the green bus as the engines began to purr, nearly missing my midnight\
  \ ride and made myself comfortable for my 7 hour journey through German countryside\
  \ to my next destination, the unknown land of Poland. \n\tThe bus was humid, loud\
  \ and smelled of stale vodka. \u201CFINAL STOP KRAKOW,\u201D  yelled a stout middle\
  \ aged Polish man. I awoke abruptly and made my way into the bustling station. Groggy\
  \ and confused, I reached for my phone to look up the directions to the flat I had\
  \ rented. No service. No wifi. No hope. Depending on yourself is a heavy task. It\
  \ takes courage because without it, self doubt can be crippling. It engulfs you,\
  \ impairs you, the anxiety takes over and fills your mind with clouded thoughts.\
  \ Traveling isn\u2019t so glamorous when you're lost. The city was dark and grey,\
  \ signs in different languages, unfriendly faces everywhere. The flat was in the\
  \ old Jewish quarter where the buildings were dilapidated and full of history. I\
  \ had never seen a place like this before. After many wrong turns and broken conversations,\
  \ I found my flat.I took a shower, disconnected, checked for ghosts, chain smoked\
  \ and cried until I fell asleep. When I awoke, it was nearly 10pm. My stomach was\
  \ roaring with hunger and I thought to myself, \u201Cevery day I cry, but everyday\
  \ I try,\u201D with that notion, I ventured into the dark night in a new town where\
  \ I knew nothing. Alone I walked on those dark wet cobblestone roads lit only by\
  \ dim flickering street lights and the burning of my cigarette. Aimlessly. I learned\
  \ that night that this was the best part of traveling alone, the quietness of the\
  \ streets and yourself, the acceptance of self reliance. My feet against the pavement,\
  \ every step was mine and mine alone. I think back to that first night in Poland,\
  \ how eventually it was okay and how it made me stronger, less afraid. I found a\
  \ hole in the wall bar serving traditional Polish eats and spirits. I sat at a small\
  \ table and ordered the first thing on the menu: pierogi and vodka."
