Text: "As I looked out into the Atlantic Ocean, my eyes began to well up with tears.\
  \ This final sight was what seemed to push me over the edge. I was standing at the\
  \ Door of No Return, located in Gor\xE9e Island\u2019s House of Slaves. The island\
  \ was where many enslaved Africans were held before being shipped to the New World.\
  \ It was where their feet touched their soil for the last time. As I stared out\
  \ the door, it occurred to me that this vast and infinite horizon might have been\
  \ the last glimpse that enslaved Africans had of their homeland. Yet, what a sight\
  \ it was. The ocean was dark blue with black undertones similar to those found in\
  \ darkened blood \u2013 gory yet mesmerizing. This sensation was amplified by the\
  \ hushed cry of the early afternoon current and the startling sound of the waves\
  \ as they broke against the rocks which sounded like a paddle hitting flesh. The\
  \ latter was what finally caused a tear to roll down my cheek and fall onto the\
  \ ground once walked on by those held in captivity. I wondered if their teardrops\
  \ had been bottled, would they have filled the ocean?\n\n\tThere wasn\u2019t much\
  \ to see during the ferry ride to Gor\xE9e island. I had arrived during Harmattan\
  \ season, therefore, a dusty fog from the northeasterly winds of the Sahara Desert\
  \ sat over the horizon like a heavy cloud, and greatly reduced any visibility of\
  \ the seascape. For the majority of the trip, the island came in out of vision until,\
  \ suddenly, out from the dust, emerged houses painted with different shades of paprika,\
  \ ginger, and turmeric featuring tiny blue wooden windows - we had arrived. I had\
  \ expected the island to be meek and sinister, similar to Robben Island where Nelson\
  \ Mandela had been imprisoned. However, Gor\xE9e was an orchestra \u2013 hawkers\
  \ yelling prices, key chains dinging in souvenir shops, tourists bargaining, fish\
  \ frying, peanuts roasting, market ladies laughing \u2013 these different instruments\
  \ came together to play a sweet and animated tune. In search of the tour guide offices,\
  \ I made my way up a pathway lined with vibrant paintings for sale on one side and\
  \ charming restaurants with tented verandas on the other. Finding the tour guides\
  \ was easy - they all wore white polo shirts and were surrounded by groups of tourist\
  \ with tan legs and pale thighs peeking out from underneath of their Khaki shorts.\n\
  \n\tMy tour guide was the only one not in uniform, instead he had a traditional\
  \ cloth draped across his body. He was also missing his two front teeth and was\
  \ the only elder guide. Perhaps this was why he was not concerned with palliating\
  \ the stories of the island. He walked us through historical monuments swarming\
  \ with tourists and lead us down quiet narrow residential streets paved with cobblestones.\
  \ With the comportment of a wise man, he narrated off-script chronicles of each\
  \ setting and wove the island together. The dualism of his approach was paralleled\
  \ by the dichotomy of the weather - in one moment, the wind would blow past you\
  \ like a low whisper, making the hair on your skin stand alert like a dog\u2019\
  s ears trying to interpret an intuition; then in a heartbeat, the sun would bear\
  \ down on you demanding to be noticed as your sweat began to mix with the layer\
  \ of dust on your skin. \n\n\tThe House of Slaves was our final stop. Here tourists\
  \ spoke in low muffled tones as a sign of respect. The murmurs, alongside the dull\
  \ red walls and the echoey footsteps from the cemented floors, felt eerie. Whereas,\
  \ the occasional sound of a camera clicking felt almost paranormal. As I walked\
  \ around the house, the dust burned my nostrils like cinnamon and left an aftertaste\
  \ of iron in my mouth. I watched as tourists tried to fit themselves into a small\
  \ cell by contorting their bodies into a question mark and then gasping when they\
  \ couldn\u2019t quite fit. I walked slowly around each cell making sure to diligently\
  \ observe every surface. Perhaps I was looking for a secret message carved into\
  \ the walls, most likely, I was avoiding having to do the inevitable \u2013 walking\
  \ to the Door."
