Text: "As we got down the bus and started strolling towards our hotel, which was 2\
  \ blocks away, we experienced something really sad and shocking which would depress\
  \ us at least for a few years if not a lifetime. \nIt was our honeymoon trip to\
  \ the land of the Rich; Canada. The travel agent had booked us the whole day with\
  \ a tourist guide who was responsible to show us around the city and its attractions.\
  \ We were taken to the museum, the Nathan Philips Square, the Winter wonderland,\
  \ and all the other mesmerizing places. We were so inspired and moved by the culture\
  \ and heritage, the beauty of downtown, the tall shiny glass buildings which showcased\
  \ a class and the rich economy of the country. We even joked about how we would\
  \ want to move here thinking this part of the world has better surviving opportunities\
  \ than the place we currently live in. \nWith a heart full of happiness and a mind\
  \ full of glamorous memories, we were walking slowly towards our hotel. It was a\
  \ dark and freezing night, we were clad in our most beautiful overcoats and our\
  \ long snow boots which we had specially bought for this trip as we came from a\
  \ place where temperatures go high to the maximum. It was our first time to travel\
  \ in a snowy land but we had dressed ourselves for the minus temperature which made\
  \ walking in the freezing night possible. As we took the turn, we thought we heard\
  \ some thing, and then something moved in the dark, a little far from us. We both\
  \ thought it was a dog or a an animal trying to cover itself from the cruel winter\
  \ wind. Feeling sorry for the poor soul, we started moving again slowly trying not\
  \ to make any noise. And then we saw the shiny grey hair strands out of the rag..\
  \ lying on the bench trying to cover himself, the old man was struggling to cover\
  \ both his feet and his head but failed. And then there were 2 more in a similar\
  \ situation. We came back to our hotel rooms with a heavy heart and trying to just\
  \ shed off the last few moments from our minds, as we covered ourselves with the\
  \ fluffy white, spotless quilts, but we both were quite sure that the thought is\
  \ going to linger in our minds for a long, long time."
