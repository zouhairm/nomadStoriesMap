Text: "Nestled behind a few winding stairs and a row of luminescent oriental lanterns\
  \ bobbing gently in the wind lies \u2018Hung Snake Restaurant\u2019, run by Mr Hung,\
  \ but known to all as \u2018Dragon\u2019. It is one of a cluster of restaurants\
  \ owned by local snake catchers that together make up \u2018Snake Village\u2019\
  \ in L\u1EC7 M\u1EADt, located 7km outside of Hanoi.\n\nIt was the bright, neon\
  \ sign with pictures of snakes plastered across it that gave away in the low evening\
  \ light that we had arrived. Here we were to select a slithering specimen, watch\
  \ it be killed and then enjoy this delicacy in a series of carefully prepared dishes.\
  \ At first, I had felt truly courageous when my brother told me that I had been\
  \ the only one amongst his ex-pat friends who had agreed to partake in this adventure\
  \ with him. However, my inflated pride soon gave way to trepidation.\n\nWe entered\
  \ into an unsettling and tense atmosphere. The faces of fellow snake village pilgrims\
  \ looked up with somewhat cautionary expressions. This did not seem to be the place\
  \ that promised an experience both \u201Camazing\u201D and \u201Cstellar\u201D.\
  \ We took our seats around a freshly-mopped tiled floor; I gulped as this was clearly\
  \ the ceremonial killing ground. There was no way the two of us could or wanted\
  \ to devour an entire snake so we decided to join a party of six Slovakians. They\
  \ sat with a sepulchral sincerity that jarred with our initial light-hearted approach\
  \ to this experience. We were on the brink of leaving when Dragon began wrestling\
  \ with a cobra chosen to satisfy our party\u2019s appetite. He taunted it mercilessly,\
  \ testing its patience. He handled the snake dexterously, but this had clearly taken\
  \ some mastering given the missing finger on his right hand. Our jaws dropped and\
  \ we let out shrieks of disbelief and awe as he collected the snake\u2019s blood\
  \ and bile whilst draining off the venom.\n\nIn what seemed like an initiation for\
  \ a morbid cult, our next \u2018task\u2019 was to each drink a shot of the blood\
  \ and then bile, both mixed with rice wine. The blood had an unsavoury after-taste\
  \ of iron and the bile a rather bitter one \u2013 but neither were tinged with regret\
  \ at drinking them. I roared out of a sense of achievement, knowing that what I\
  \ had just done was utterly unique. Legend has it that these blood-curdling concoctions\
  \ support a healthy immune system \u2013 and male sexual vitality. What followed\
  \ was an array of eight delicious dishes made up from the entire cobra: from crunchy,\
  \ crushed snake bones infused with lemongrass to saut\xE9ed snake meat in Guise\
  \ leaf and a broth brimming with reptilian \u2018trimmings\u2019. All beer and snake\
  \ wine \u2013 a strong spirit-like wine in a bottle containing a dead snake with\
  \ mouth open and tongue protruding \u2013 was free of charge so we were soon laughing\
  \ away memory of our former fears.\n\nThis adventure is certainly not for the faint-hearted,\
  \ but one that I can unreservedly recommend. I relish seeking out experiences that\
  \ transport me as far away as possible from that which I already know \u2013 and\
  \ this is the furthest I have ever been taken. I gained a new understanding of and\
  \ appreciation for a culture that has no qualms when it comes to culinary customs.\
  \ Although I did not exactly leave any richer \u2013 the price of this experience\
  \ is admittedly not cheap by Vietnam\u2019s usual standards \u2013 I did come away\
  \ with a wealth of memories that I shall never forget."
