Text: "Sitting on the messy back seat of an old white Peugeot, I gaze at the bare\
  \ scenery outside, the rain pounding steadily on the roof. I sigh of relief knowing\
  \ I can finally feel the toes of my feet. The sound of the car\u2019s tires running\
  \ briskly on the wet pavement soothes my ears, as I sense the trembling of the window\
  \ my head lays against.\n\nIt\u2019s probably been nine hours since I last had a\
  \ proper meal, three days since I slept on comfy clean sheets. Two hours and a half\
  \ since I last felt hopeless, as I stood with my friend at the exit of Mont Saint\
  \ Michel, aimlessly and animatedly waving our cardboard signs towards the very few\
  \ cars that would come our way. For only fools would go to le Mont Saint Michel\
  \ on a rainy Monday in November, paraphrasing Man\xF9, our French saviour. \u201C\
  C'est pas mal fou\u201D, he said, with a strong \u201Cbr\xE9ton\u201D accent and\
  \ an amused smile.\n\nI scroll through the pages of my little notebook and I mentally\
  \ trace back our path in the many roads and facets of France. I am suddenly remembered\
  \ of the multitude of encounters we made on this four-month journey of a four-year\
  \ power, from overly touristic and doll-like Alsatian towns to the quaint and chatty\
  \ Marseille. In each of those, we endlessly waited on the streets, in sweating heat\
  \ or tossed by the freezing wind, stretching our thumbs up, waiting for luck to\
  \ come upon us.\nThose waiting hours always weight like an eternity. And as the\
  \ mind loses out of any hope left, there it is, a car approaching, someone stops,\
  \ a family returning from the holidays in Villard-de-Lans or a former elderly hitch-hiker.\
  \ Or a police unit that just got a call warning on us.\n\nThere is a sort of genuine\
  \ openness a shared car ride gives: as we step into their four-wheeled cubicle,\
  \ we are unconsciously welcomed to get to know bits and parts of their daily lives.\
  \ And throughout the whole ride, we are invited to let our lives be shared. We know\
  \ nothing of them but the faces, and we sometimes ignore each other's names. We\
  \ exchange pleasantries, mostly silences and sometimes unusual life stories, so\
  \ long and captivating, to keep us parked at a gas station.\nThe back seat has now\
  \ become my gateway into the lives of others. I question the homey objects I find\
  \ around me: a slightly worn pink car seat, some random dog toys. Cola cans left\
  \ on the ground for who knows how long, window stickers of the favourite football\
  \ team. A pine scent Arbre Magique and a rosary wrapped in a rear-view mirror. They\
  \ all instil a sort of unicity to their everyday life, they tell me small fleeting\
  \ details of their identity. What is not expressed in words comes out of the secrecy\
  \ of the back seat.\n\nSo here we are, embraced by this dusty car's warmth with\
  \ still drenched socks, quietly chatting with our French driver, here I am with\
  \ an oddly stinking rottweiler at 10 cm from my face. Stella, says the golden nameplate\
  \ of her collar. She is sticking her tongue out, menacing to slap it all over my\
  \ face at any minute. And as I uncomfortably continue writing on my tiny block note,\
  \ all curled up in wet soaked clothes, as I feel my rumbling belly and the weight\
  \ of the day graving on my shoulders, while Man\xF9 tells us about Rennes, the new\
  \ city we're heading to, I am whole. As if there were no other place I would rather\
  \ be aside from this old-fashioned, warm and messy car, which feels like home."
