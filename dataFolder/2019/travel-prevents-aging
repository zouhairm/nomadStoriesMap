Text: "To hold on to your youth, you could stay home; avoid the sunshine; and apply\
  \ gobs of ointments, lotions, and astringents. \nOr how about packing a bag; hopping\
  \ a plane, and traveling to a place in the world you've only dreamed about. Perhaps\
  \ it's sunny Portugal with its perfect beaches, ancient castles, red-tiled roofs,\
  \ wide rivers--the list is endless. Or France with its exquisite pastries, fashion\
  \ sense, country estates situated on expansive green fields, out-of-this-world wine\
  \ selection.  Or would you prefer Italy and its intricate, breathtaking architecture,\
  \ its lush countrysides, its exceptional opera. Or perhaps you're drawn to Asian,\
  \ American, or African locales? Or maybe you see yourself climbing mountains, boating\
  \ through lush swamps, experiencing  delicious cuisine that's like nothing mom ever\
  \ served.  It's the thrill of travel, the experience of new cultures, listening\
  \ to and learning about new languages, seeing the world through unique perspectives,\
  \ discovering exciting new places, and falling in love with our planet. It's all\
  \ about reviving that sense of wonder we had as children when faced with something\
  \ exciting and new.\nThat is how you'll stay young and vibrant! Keep active, continue\
  \ learning about the world, and explore to your heart's content--that is the key\
  \ to youth! Just travel!"
