  \ beautiful customs and also it is a good chance to improve my writing skill. However,\
  \ I have the writing skill but for improving that I was need to know more about\
  \ writing of other languages and other culture,  how they are write a story? Which\
  \ experience they use to write better? And this kinds of more things about writing\
