Text: "As I looked down at my tie-dye shirt and shorts, I realized that I had never\
  \ felt more uncomfortable. Stepping out onto the beach, it became evident that there\
  \ was something else missing, besides my lack of clothes. The sounds of boys roughhousing,\
  \ and the thumping of the plastic bag soccer ball echoed in my head as I searched\
  \ in vain for any other women. Although I had been experiencing a free pass for\
  \ the entirety of my time in Comoros because of my \u2018mzungu\u2019 or white person\
  \ status, at this point I couldn\u2019t help but feeling exposed and disrespectful.\
  \ I was being introduced to my brother\u2019s beach for the first time while I was\
  \ practically naked. The beach that had become a second home for him during both\
  \ the good and bad moments of his Peace Corps experience. It was exactly how he\u2019\
  d described it. A snapshot of the vibrant lives of the fishermen working on their\
  \ boats, the little boys begging their brothers to let them join in the game, and\
  \ the \u2018sugar cookies\u2019 flopping around in the sand, all against the idyllic\
  \ backdrop of the icy blue waves. My brother explained that the sugar cookies were\
  \ boys that had run away from their homes, refusing to go to school or be told what\
  \ to do. It is a fitting nickname seeing as they would run into the water to bathe\
  \ themselves, and then roll around in the sand producing a good \u2018sugar\u2019\
  \ coating on their bodies and faces, all while being naked themselves. It is a supposedly\
  \ very exfoliating practice. I sighed a breath of relief, there were my naked brethren\
  \ on the beach, even if it was not the same. We ran into the water that most others\
  \ were avoiding because of the cooler temperatures. My brother comfortable in his\
  \ swim trunks, and me not so much in my shirt and shorts. He squealed about it being\
  \ too cold having gotten used to the Anjouan life, while I found the clear water\
  \ faultless, and made fun of him for being a wimp. Then some of the sandy sugar\
  \ cookies laughing and pointing bounded into the water. They started yelling and\
  \ splashing around with us, saying swearwords that only my brother could understand.\
  \ As quickly as they came over to us, they ran back out of the water, diving into\
  \ the sand. Oddly, they seemed to be even more excited than before. I continued\
  \ to swim around when I noticed a stick floating towards us. Nothing quite menacing,\
  \ just an unassuming stick. Only when it got about an arm's length away from us,\
  \ we realized with horror that it was no stick. My brother yelling \u201CPOOP,\u201D\
  \ held his breath and made a mad dash for the sand, leaving me to fend for myself.\
  \ I had experienced a code brown once before at an amusement park in the wave pool\
  \ but hadn\u2019t expected it to happen while I was swimming in the Indian Ocean.\
  \ I got out of the water with my shoulders slumped, the sugar cookies still pointing\
  \ and dying laughing. I sat down rubbing sand on my wet legs. If I had been initiated\
  \ into the club, then I was going to act like it. Watching the sunset that night\
  \ from the beach, I was almost content. Meeting my brother\u2019s friends, seeing\
  \ his favorite place, and hanging out with the sugar cookies had been fun, but I\
  \ was missing all the girls my age I had met, headscarves on and putting their children\
  \ to bed at this moment."
