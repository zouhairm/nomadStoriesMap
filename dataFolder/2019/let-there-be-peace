Text: "They call me American. I am not just\_yabanc\u0131\_\u2014 foreigner \u2014\
  \ but a particular breed of outsider. People back home often ask me what it\u2019\
  s like to be an American in Turkey, fearing the stereotype that the \u201CMiddle\
  \ East\u201D resents the United States and thus its progeny. Don\u2019t speak English\
  \ too loudly. Don\u2019t bring clothes with American insignias. Don\u2019t let them\
  \ target you.\n\nThere\u2019s a store in \xC7orum that sells \u201Chip\u201D clothing,\
  \ some of it emblazoned with broken English. Among the findings was the message,\
  \ \u201Cthe fact is that the world is out of everyone\u2019s expectation But some\
  \ learn to forget But others insist.\u201D Another stated something unintelligible\
  \ about snowflakes. A third impelled us to \u201Calways wear your invisible crown.\u201D\
  \n\nSince my arrival in Turkey, I\u2019ve often felt that being an American here\
  \ is like having an invisible crown permanently attached to my head. Even in Istanbul,\
  \ I was able to finagle free \xE7ay and pastries after telling the waiter my nationality.\
  \ Turks are known for their unparalleled hospitality, but I can\u2019t help but\
  \ think that for me its amplified by my \u201CAmerican-ness.\u201D\n\n\u201CIngiliz?\
  \ Frans\u0131z?\u201D a waiter asked, after realizing I couldn\u2019t speak Turkish.\
  \ \u201CAmerikal\u0131m.\u201D \u201CAmerikkaaaaa!\u201D he exclaimed, eyes wide\
  \ in shock at the prospect of someone from across the pond landing in \xC7orum.\
  \ The service was impeccable, and when I got up to leave, the wait staff stood on\
  \ either side of the hall and waved as I made my exit. This coffee house was exquisite,\
  \ a place where, if it were in the United States, I would be lucky to even get service.\
  \ Here, I got an unmerited Oscars red carpet.\n\nAs an American teaching English,\
  \ I have been welcomed everywhere I go. So the threat of being in Turkey does not\
  \ come from discrimination per se but a lack thereof \u2014 at least towards me.\
  \ It comes from getting caught in the crossfire of events unrelated to my \u201C\
  American-ness\u201D. By becoming just a human \u2014 in the wrong place at the wrong\
  \ time.\n\nThe explosion in Ankara was the largest terror attack in Turkish history:\
  \ 95 confirmed dead and over 200 injured. These\_bombings\_targeted a peace protest\
  \ calling for an end to Turkish-Kurdish violence. To restate: a\_peace\_rally was\
  \ the site of the deadliest terrorist attack in Turkish history.\_\nMy roommate\u2019\
  s friend was there and barely escaped the blast, leaving the scene \u201Cwith pieces\
  \ of human\_on her.\u201D Pieces of a life. Blood. Body parts. Parting gifts from\
  \ some of the 95 people who would never see their families again. They became martyrs\
  \ to the fight against fighting, and these were their last shreds of non-violent\_\
  reconciliation. Their protest was not a question mark; both their lives and their\
  \ dreams were abruptly ended by a war they never asked for and exclaimed against.\n\
  \nWe don\u2019t know who did this and we don\u2019t know why.\_What we do know was\
  \ that there was a senseless loss of life, and one that speaks to the all-too-human\
  \ tendency to box the world into \u201Cus\u201D and \u201Cthem\u201D while blasting\
  \ the \u201Cother\u201D side to pieces. No country is exempt from it, but this tragedy\
  \ hit home. My new home, filled with so many kind, generous, and life-loving people,\
  \ was hurting.\n\nRegardless of the culprit, this attack was\_a deliberate message\
  \ of silence and intimidation. It said that Ankara, and all of Turkey, would be\
  \ forced into shock and mourning through the upcoming election. It said that peace\
  \ was not an option. It called every death by disagreement \u201Cjustice\u201D and\
  \ every public space a battlefield. It claimed that people with opposing views thereby\
  \ revoked their right to be human \u2014 and thus deserved to be corpses.\n\nI worry\
  \ that in an increasingly interdependent world, we will only find more of these\
  \ tragic \u201Csolutions\u201D to sift through the complexities around us. The ironic\
  \ thing is that bombs don\u2019t discriminate. Their targets may come from prejudice,\
  \ but when explosions erupt or bullets flood out of their cartridge, they don\u2019\
  t ask what you believe or where you come from. They only care where you are standing.\n\
  \nAnd in that moment, no one is anything other than human."
