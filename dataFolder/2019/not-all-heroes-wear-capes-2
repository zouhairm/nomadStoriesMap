Text: "The moment I locked eyes with the scared little malnourished boy with the tear\
  \ stained face and weathered, tattered clothes I knew I had to do everything I could\
  \ to save him. As a young girl, Superheroes never stood out to me, but this particular\
  \ superhero locked me in place. It was tightly clutched by a refugee boy entering\
  \ his new settlement of surrounding dirt and tarps and each blink was filled with\
  \ the uncertainty of a safer tomorrow.\_\_Still, his piercing gaze flashed a sliver\
  \ of hope through a half smile that washed away the fear, curiosity and loneliness\
  \ that hid behind his eyes. Most people recognize superheroes by their insignia\
  \ on their chest or the superpowers they possess, but I knew at that moment that\
  \ I was in the presence of a superhero. I knew why I was meant to be there, that\
  \ this boy is more than a refugee, his action figure representing more than a friend,\
  \ and that it was my job to do everything in my power to help this little boy. \n\
  My own personal upbringing has always encouraged me to challenge my own perspectives\
  \ and view situations from multiple angles, but nothing could have prepared me to\
  \ experience the realities of a Syrian refugee camp. This experience allowed for\
  \ a deeper internalization and juxtaposition between everything I\u2019ve been categorized\
  \ in all of my life and the camps that the refugees now called home. This was the\
  \ first time I was able to reflect my own affliction in the eyes of everyone going\
  \ through the same tribulation as the child. I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to\
  \ never have had to endure challenges as horrible as Ahmad\u2019s, yet still be\
  \ able to relate to his story based on my personal struggles. Ahmad was 6 years\
  \ old and just one of the many orphaned Syrian refugees at the camp I had the opportunity\
  \ to volunteer at a few summers ago while I was in Jordan. I had made it a personal\
  \ project of mine during a family trip to the Middle East to witness first-hand\
  \ the results of war, destitution, and political turmoil that result in failed states\
  \ as well as trying to understand the implications and reasoning behind such downfalls.\
  \ The people who pay the ultimate price due to the lack of a stable government are\
  \ those like Ahmad that live in poverty, hunger, and bloodshed.\nI never could have\
  \ imagined that this personal research project could turn into a soul-searching\
  \ adventure and the last thing I expected was the impact of enduring a journey of\
  \ self-realization, especially by a 6-year-old boy. Ahmad and I formed an unbreakable\
  \ bond and every night before bed he begged me to tell him a new superman story.\
  \ On my final night at the camp after our routine story, I asked him how he was\
  \ feeling, his response was always the same: \u201CBaba said I should always be\
  \ strong like my Superman.\u201D Those were the words said to him by his father\
  \ that will forever remain etched into his memories. He thanked me for the stories,\
  \ his new Superman T-shirt, the games we played, and the memories made. He gave\
  \ me a long hug and I could feel his tears soaking into my shirt as he whispered\
  \ into my ear that I was his Superwoman. \nI was no superwoman. Ahmad was the real\
  \ hero of the story. I to this day, cannot fathom to see how this child who was\
  \ stripped from everything and everyone he ever knew down to a deteriorating plastic\
  \ action figure managed to stand so firm and brave in the face of adversity. What\
  \ Ahmad taught me in just those three weeks was more than what my coursework had\
  \ taught me in 3 years. I was enlightened with newfound knowledge and a life lesson\
  \ that can\u2019t be taught within the walls of a classroom but from various people,\
  \ places, and experiences. I was fortunate enough to be taught by a Syrian refugee\
  \ named Ahmad with a charismatic personality, mischievous humor, heart of gold,\
  \ and his Superman action figure."
