Text: "That old dude with the sick moustache was right, time is relative. When you\
  \ travel, it doesn't exist, well not the way I travel. Time being the most precious\
  \ thing you have, when you travel by foot it feels like yesterday was last month.\
  \ One of these ever lasting days, I walked across a beautiful garden filled with\
  \ apple trees. No Adam, no Eve, but Pablo's imperfect crooked smile. \n\nTime to\
  \ practice that very imperfect Spanish of mine ''perdona, me pregunt\xE1ba si seria\
  \ posible de acampar en vuestro jard\xEDn por una noche?\". And little did I know\
  \ that this demand of hospitality was about to become an incredible friendship with\
  \ a fifty year old man. We went out, talked over a bottle of wine and discovered\
  \ that I was camping in his family's garden. Pablo actually lives on a boat 200km\
  \ away. I needn't more. Two weeks later I was living on a boat. One, two, five bottles\
  \ of ''Sidra'' later, I find myself a guest star of a very unique sitcom. Life.\
  \ \n\nThere is something very romantic in the idea of not knowing what will happen.\
  \ I spent four days living on his boat, drinking and talking with a very artistic\
  \ group of his. I had coffee with the street violinist, talked about movies with\
  \ a movie director, and a girl with who I was listening to the previously mentionned\
  \ violinist, offered her garden when I was going to walk through her village. I\
  \ left a little part of my heart on that boat when it was time to say goodbye to\
  \ Pablo. He had become more than a nice host, he became a friend. It was the first\
  \ time in two years that saying goodbye hurt a little. I hate saying ''Adios''.\
  \ When it's time to get off wave goodbye, blow a kiss, and remember how great it\
  \ was. Unitl then, enjoy the ride."
