Text: "India is bursting at the seams when it comes to the variety in culture , tradition\
  \ and landscape. It will be impossible to go into details but in very brief I would\
  \ like to introduce all of you to the bio-diverse hotspot \"Dzongu\". \nLet me take\
  \ you there. It was during the beginning of the monsoons in India that me and my\
  \ wife decided to take on the hilly terrains of Sikkim (a state in India) in our\
  \ beloved Jeep (we lovingly call him 'Jajabor' meaning wanderer in our native tongue).\
  \ I am always on the look out for offbeat stays and this time a beautiful property\
  \ caught my attention, Munlom Nature resort in Dzongu. I was surprised because I\
  \ never heard of this place before and that too in Sikkim, one of the most sought\
  \ after tourism destinations of the country. I was sold and we set off . It was\
  \ a straight forward drive from my hometown of Guwahati until we hit the uphill\
  \ roads from the Coronation bridge over the river Teesta. The roads battered by\
  \ the rains were broken and rough with stretches of slush as it meandered it's way\
  \ along the raging Teesta as we headed uphill, but the adventure was yet to begin.\n\
  We took the left from the town of Singtam and I was on unfamiliar territory as I\
  \ had never been this way. We drove for a couple of hours in the company of the\
  \ majestic mountains and the gushing Teesta,  being constantly guided by our host\
  \ for the night as we reach Mangan. Now it was here that the journey took on another\
  \ level.\nOur host had graciously made our permits and kept them ready at the check\
  \ post into Dzongu. We took our permits and drove on uphill and the last km was\
  \ a dirt track up to the resort which during the monsoons can only be done with\
  \ 4x4 vehicles. Luckily Jajabor was a 4x4 and we climbed up over broken trees and\
  \ slush and as the evening settled around we were greeted by our destination with\
  \ an inviting warm glow of incandescence. It was bang in the middle of nowhere and\
  \ it was all worth it as we slowly took in the amazing hand crafted architecture\
  \ and the over powering theme of nature all around us. We met Kim our host who unfolded\
  \ what Dzongu really is.\nDzongu is the last bastion of the indigenous Lepcha tribe,\
  \ the original inhabitants of Sikkim. It is now considered a bio diversity hotspot\
  \ and the sentinels to the culture and traditions of the original inhabitants. They\
  \ still worship the mountains and Mount Kangchenjunga is considered sacred. Over\
  \ mugs of 'Chi' (millet beer) Kim enthralled us with the history and traditions\
  \ of his people. He himself was educated in the capital Delhi but came back to preserve\
  \ his heritage for future generations to come. Not all is hunky-dory as they have\
  \ to constantly fight for a balance between modernity and tradition but this is\
  \ a battle worth the effort. \nIn looking for a place to getaway from it all we\
  \ found a gem of a tradition that respects nature the way it ought to be. The few\
  \ days we stayed there amidst peace gave us clarity and a renewed vigour to take\
  \ on our lives. A piece of Dzongu lives within us and I yearn to visit again.\n\
  Munlom means 'blessing' in the native tongue and we feel blessed indeed."
