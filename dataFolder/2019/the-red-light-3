Text: "Our first night doing turtle patrol. The previous day there was a thunderstorm\
  \ that we regarded from the balcony.\n\nThe cabin was installed in the middle of\
  \ a vast garden. In front of us, a river turned on itself gave us the opportunity\
  \ to lay down between its stones and feel how the liquid smoothed our skin and fed\
  \ the ocean. Crossing that narrow waterway, there was a completely virgin semi-round\
  \ beach, where we picked up garbage during the day.\n\nWe, all the volunteers, were\
  \ lodging at the same room. We had neither light nor signal.\n\nThat evening, Edgar,\
  \ the volunteer leader, divided us into groups for patrol. I chose to do it from\
  \ 2:00 to 5:00 am.\n\nThe first group returned, they didn\u2019t find any turtle.\n\
  \n\u201CI hope we do see some! Maybe this time is better for it,\u201D said my friend\
  \ May.\n\nThe full moon was tracing the landscape. We traversed the river and some\
  \ of us left our shoes on the edge of the shore to sense the sand.\n\n\u201CMaes,\
  \ let\u2019s move on quickly, the turtles won\u2019t wait for us,\u201D Edgar claimed.\n\
  \nThe air felt steamy. As we traveled on foot, our thoughts grew into worlds.\n\n\
  \u201CDo you think we\u2019ll be Lucky?\u201D Dulce asked.\n\n\u201CYes, mae. We\
  \ just have to be heedful.\u201D\n\nThe moon was getting closer to the sea. When\
  \ we were already tired and sleepy, we recognized her: the shadow of her large shell\
  \ was moving in the gloom. We got close and could see her paws digging in the sand.\
  \ Edgar illuminated her from afar with a red light \u2013the only light that doesn\u2019\
  t hurt them or confuse them- and we approach gradually so that she wouldn\u2019\
  t notice our presence.\n\nWe sat down around her and we observed in silence. Later,\
  \ I reclined to watch her anatomy from below\u2026 her claws were actually vigorous.\n\
  \nWhen the hole was ready, she began to spawn.\n\nEvery time an egg fell in the\
  \ nest, Edgar pressed the button of a special machine to count them. In total, she\
  \ dropped forty-seven. The moon had already hidden in the salty water so now the\
  \ night was completely dark.\n\nWhen the turtle finishedspawning, she covered her\
  \ eggs with the sand she had taken from the excavation, and left the ground as it\
  \ was before.\n\n\u201CWhen they want to return to the ocean, they follow the light.\
  \ That\u2019s why hotels by the sea damage them, because they confuse them\u201D\
  \ Edgar declared.\n\nWe stood up and stepped aside to make way for her. We shifted\
  \ slightly forward and then stopped.\n\nHer steps were slow and difficult. She constantly\
  \ interrupted her movement to take a rest and then resume her path.\n\nIn the distance,\
  \ we contemplated everything in silence.\n\n\u201CCan we help her?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  No. It\u2019s her process.\u201D\n\nThe creature was lonely in front of the immensity.\
  \ In the abysmal darkness, there was only her and the red spot that stained her\
  \ back.\n\nSuddenly, her fragility reshaped my existence. She was there, alone,\
  \ as my being in the world and in the universe.\n\n\u201CDude, this feels like the\
  \ death hour,\u201D said May to me.\n\n\u201CBut behind us there is new life, and\
  \ we are here,\u201D I replied.\n\nSo the turtle kept going. The waves hit her and\
  \ rebounded her, but she recovered and remained until the water embraced her fully\
  \ and made her disappear.  \n\nEdgar turned off the red light.  \n\nIn our stroll\
  \ back we listened to the sea. Our worlds and our silence came from our heart. We\
  \ felt connected."
