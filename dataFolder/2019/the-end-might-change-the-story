Text: "\u2018 I saw them and felt a connection. I approached them and had a little\
  \ chit chat. They were 3 pretty girls on an unplanned short trip to portugal. By\
  \ talking further i came to knew that they were also from India the same place that\
  \ I belonged to having a flight back in 2 days to India. I showed them around. We\
  \ sat in the mandatory yellow tram. They had met me at the ending of their trip.\
  \ They had a bus to catch at night to Madrid. Oh yes they were on a study trip to\
  \ madrid from where they decided to explore Portugal as well. So a bus to Madrid\
  \ and then next day a flight to India. We had fun time and the day was ending not\
  \ realising the short time duration. We started running towards the bus station.\
  \ We took the tram to reach early but hastily we sat in the wrong tram. So that\
  \ increased the distance then we took the correct tram got down n started running\
  \ towards the station as it was a bit more far. We ran n reached and the girls couldn\u2019\
  t find the bus it had already left the station. Trying to keep calm we ran a bit\
  \ and decided to take a cab. I left them in that cab not knowing if they caught\
  \ the bus from the next station and the flight next day\u2019 This is How I wonder\
  \ the man that met us would describe us. So i ll continue the story ahead we reached\
  \ the next station and told our cab to stop it in front of the bus. It was like\
  \ a Bollywood movie scene the adrenaline rush was high we saw the bus and it was\
  \ our last bus to madrid. Now one more added thing our driver had sold our tickets\
  \ to someone else as we were not on time. The lady came shouting telling us all\
  \ about being on time. We apologised to her and took our tickets back. And our hearts\
  \ were thumping and it was like a dream to catch the last bus. I don\u2019t know\
  \ what would have happened if we would have missed that bus. It would have been\
  \ another costly adventure for sure... This experience still gives me an adrenaline\
  \ rush."
