Text: "The dark bottom is good! It always push me to give more. I moved from Syria\
  \ to Dubai with one thing in my mind, borders will stop my all the time coz i dont\
  \ have a visa, and i will always find another way to enter! \nDear reader dont think\
  \ of it as a sad story, because it is not! Actually i dont care if you will show\
  \ empathy, because you will be missing thr whole point! \n\nWith no access to Europe,\
  \ US, Canada or Australia i discovered that i can enter, Cambodia, Nepal, Tanzania,\
  \ Turkey, Egypt, lebanon ..etc. with no visa how cool is that!! \nI know i am missing\
  \ Evel tower, but i did Kilimanjaro instead. And instead of doing a boat trip in\
  \ italy I experienced white water rafting in Nepal! \nSuch an experience, and OMG\
  \ the people i met, they changed me! Or to be honest it creates me all over again!\n\
  Believe me when i am saying that i care about my career now, just to efforts the\
  \ tickets. And yes i am successful in what i am doing for living, but with goal\
  \ to travel more and buy less always guides me \u201Cif you dont know the consept\
  \ you should check it out\u201D\n\nAs a Syrian citizen, i was trapped into the idea\
  \ that best teachers are in schools and universities! Such a funny joke, right!\
  \ Learning about cultures, people and places shaped me, life makes sense now! It\
  \ really did! My first trip was to turkey end of 2015 i saved money for two years,\
  \ and i went there to meet one of my very best friend! 15 magical days in a magical\
  \ country! But i missed one thing, being with a friend destroyed the idea of discover\
  \ more, and to meet new people, lets say more new people! Since then I always travels\
  \ solo! \n\nMy dear reader that we will never meet! I have the experience of surviving\
  \ an actual was! You dont have it! I feel sorry for you that you missed the feeling\
  \ of being alive for real and to appreciate everything you have! \n\nYou might have\
  \ a good passport but we both cant go to the moon :-) \n\nMy warm regards,\nBilal."
