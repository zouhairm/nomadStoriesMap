Text: "We The human race,\nHow deficit of worthy emotions,\nPlanting seeds who's results\
  \ we can't face\n\nWhen we claim to care,\nBut not see the actions we dare\nI, me,\
  \ myself- is our only faith. \n\nA way comes when we forget our ethics,\nAnd indulge\
  \ in unwanted practices.\nDo you ever give it a thought,\nOf the results you haven't\
  \ been able to won!\n\n\nSometimes you are so self centred\nLeaving behind the defection,\n\
  The uncountable affection,\nThe sound of perfection,\nWhat is left is something\
  \ you never wanted,\n\nYour gilt and screaming rejection!\n\nHave you ever thought..\n\
  Have you ever noticed.. \nHave you cared, loved or supported,\n\nHow would you,\n\
  When you know nothing, \nBut just AUTRISIM!\n\n\nWhat are you? \nHave you thought?\n\
  I, me, myself is your identity \nAnd Rest everything is just a mystery.\n\nThere\
  \ is still wildness,\nA clinch of laughter,\nAn ocean of emotions,\nA spread of\
  \ hopes,\nAnd a rule of life,\n\nThere is still a way, \nA way where you won't be\
  \ as lost as you have been,\nA way where you can sense what till now you haven't,\n\
  A way When you could be alord soul,\nA way by which you can be someone,\nSomeone\
  \ to somebody else,\nSomeone to spread some smiles\nSomeone to give something, \n\
  Something that isn't always for you,\nSomething that doesn't causes any harm,\n\
  Something that can give a soul a shining a smile.\nSomething that can make you someone\
  \ great.\n\nThat will be the time when YOU,\nYOU, \"SOMEONE\" would be the greatest\
  \ hero,\nNarrating your story that hasn't seen any other way,\nBut to greatness\
  \ and compassion I must say!\n\n-Chavi Mehal"
