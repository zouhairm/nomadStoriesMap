Text: "A few years ago I experienced a wonderful experience in Jodhpur, which I feel\
  \ is worthy of sharing with you.\n\nBuilt atop the hill holding the stature of Mehrangarh\
  \ Fort since centuries, anyone would lose control over themselves once they see\
  \ the intriguing view of the city of Jodhpur from the famous Chamunda Devitemple.\
  \ Overlooking the blue city', you are certain to get a pious feeling upon entering\
  \ the temple\u2019s compound. The devout followers of Goddess Chamunda believe that\
  \ her very presence has protected the culture and citizens of this city, and will\
  \ continue to do so till the existence of Jodhpur.\n\nAfter spending some time in\
  \ solace and watching the beautiful sunset from the temple, I took a cobbled path\
  \ which led me to Sardar Market. It wasn\u2019t just a walk down the market. It\
  \ was more.itwas a lesson that change is inevitable. You cross paths with a lot\
  \ during the life and you witness changes. And all of that, just adds a bit more\
  \ of \u2018\u2019you\u2019\u2019 in you. I entered the market with these abstract\
  \ thoughts. And amazed at the kind of comfort that hustle and bustle of crowd imparted\
  \ in me. Life sometimes comes in such simple wraps. I saw kids playing with ice\
  \ cream sticks and I just clutched hard my expensive hi-tech gadgets, wondering\
  \ why couldn\u2019t they give me such happiness. On my way down, I came across numerous\
  \ sanctums with marvellous architecture, clearly telling me they were wizened with\
  \ age.\n\nBeneath the dark sky, the shimmering Clock Tower situated at the centre\
  \ of Sardar Market provoked a feeling of completeness in my mind, something that\
  \ still occupies a corner in my mind portentous.\n\nAlthough I was living in Delhi\
  \ since the past few years, I can say for sure that Jodhpur gave me the same mesmerizing\
  \ feeling which I used to feel in my childhood days. Albeit the roads have changed\
  \ their destinations, but the journey still carries the same charm which makes a\
  \ home for everyone."
