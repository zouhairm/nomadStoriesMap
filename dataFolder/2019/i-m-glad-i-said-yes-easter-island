Text: "We were going to visit the Carretera Austral. In fact, everything was planned\
  \ to travel by car and stop where night reached us. However, my grandparents said\
  \ \"we are not coming with you this year\". The days passed and there was no certainty\
  \ about this year's destination, until mom approached and said: \"What if we go\
  \ to Easter Island? We would be spending the same amount of money\".  I said yes\
  \ as soon as she made the proposal, I mean, when would I have another opportunity\
  \ like this? There are those who say that you take it or leave it. I decided to\
  \ take it. Also, the Carretera Austral is on the continent and I do not think it\
  \ will move away from America, at least not now.\n\nAnyway, dad was not so convinced.\
  \ For Christmas, Mom gave him tropical brand clothes to get used to the idea. She\
  \ even gave him a board game with a moai on the top of the box.  It took us a couple\
  \ of weeks, but finally he accepted his destiny and joined the adventure. The other\
  \ person who was going to accompany us would be my cousin. I grew up with him to\
  \ the point of considering him a younger brother. I do not remember any vacation\
  \ trip he has not been on. So yes, He's part of us.\n\nI told everyone that I was\
  \ going to record the trip and write about my experience, because I have concluded\
  \ that I want to do this for the rest of my life. At first they interpreted it as\
  \ a joke, but here I am, making a video and writing a few lines.\n\nWhen we got\
  \ off the plane I felt a warmth I had never felt before. I promise you that neither\
  \ San Pedro de Atacama is as hot as Easter Island. Although the temperature is between\
  \ 23 \xB0 and 24 \xB0, the humidity of the place causes the sensation to be very\
  \ intense (days later we were told that it was the hottest week in a year), but\
  \ when the sun was hiding the temperature It was very nice in conjunction with the\
  \ breeze. We ended our first day at Tahai watching the sunset. That's why my blog\
  \ its called \"Sunset\", because if daylight ends with the sun hiding, then a trip\
  \ must end with a story. \n\nThe second day we woke up with more energy, even when\
  \ the constant heat has tried to put us in a bad mood. I even woke up with a cockroach\
  \ on my back. We went to the small port of the Island, where we met with the guide\
  \ who helped us coordinate a boat ride to the islets located behind the big Rano\
  \ Kau, then jump into the water and practice snorkeling.\n\nOn the third day we\
  \ met Rano Raraku and Tongariki, places with a lot of history. I would like to tell\
  \ you everything but I have no space. Third day was pretty intense but we ended\
  \ it in style as we went to Ovahe and Anakena beaches. Tip! sponsor a palm tree,\
  \ its shadow is salvation. Also, if you have the opportunity to accompany your stay\
  \ in the shade with a small pineapple, do not hesitate to do so. Easter Island definitely\
  \ has the best pineapples I've ever tasted. \n\nOn the fourth and \"last day\" we\
  \ met Rano Kau and then we went to Anakena again. During the afternoon we returned\
  \ to Anakena to spend the last day with a lot of relaxation. Half an hour swimming\
  \ was enough for us, then we returned to our precious shadow that a palm tree gave\
  \ us. Next to us, a dog was lying down, which showed that she was thirsty. We had\
  \ a bottle of water and a coconut cut in half. We put some water in the coconut\
  \ and we gave it to her. We were just going to give her some because we were also\
  \ drinking, however, she licked the bottle and we had to give her all the water.\n\
  \nHere ( https://sunset.godaddysites.com/ ) is the full story if you are interested.\
  \ The problem is that is in spanish only."
