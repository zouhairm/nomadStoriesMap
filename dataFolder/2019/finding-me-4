Text: "Where do I start? I was having an adventure of a lifetime filled with laughter,\
  \ chaos and realizations. There's so much to say it's kind of hard to break it down\
  \ into just 700 words so I\u2019ll give a quick run through. Here we go:\n\nMy friends\
  \ and I decided to take a trip to London and pop over to Dublin. Two countries,\
  \ two cities. 11 days. The trip began with my hairdresser giving me a tarot card\
  \ reading. Weird? Maybe. She told me I was going on a great adventure that would\
  \ be filled with revelations. That I was worried about being in control and financial\
  \ struggles. The freaky part is she had no idea about my trip prior to the reading.\
  \ I went home that day with the mindset that I needed to sit back and relax. To\
  \ truly let go and enjoy. Which I did. London was very much like New York which\
  \ was shocking. We spent the days in London walking miles, sightseeing and realizing\
  \ how different Miami is. For example,\n1. No one holds open doors. \n2. No one\
  \ says excuse me. \n3. Everything closes at 11PM and if you're from Miami you know\
  \ that's the time people leave to go out. \nWe stuck out like sore thumbs in London\
  \ mainly because we looked Latina, spoke loud and talked with our hands. It was\
  \ hilarious being unapologetically ourselves despite the stares. We got on wrong\
  \ stops, rained on and laughed until we were laying on elevator floors (literally).\
  \ One of my favorite moments was eating pasta and drinking wine in our hotel in\
  \ our pj's. I looked around and was filled with joy. Just my girls and I having\
  \ a good time somewhere new. \n\nDublin though. Dublin was interesting. A city where\
  \ everyone looks like they\u2019re going to punch you in the face but they\u2019\
  re actually sweethearts. Dublin consisted of walking into pubs, having people stare\
  \ (again) because we were obviously from America, not understanding Gaelic and going\
  \ on a 13 hour bus tour to the cliffs of Moher on my 23rd birthday. Our tour bus\
  \ driver Paul was the sweetest old man we had ever met. He taught us facts about\
  \ Ireland, sang us Irish tunes and made us feel at home. We also sang Hey Jude by\
  \ The Beatles at the top of our lungs in the oldest pub in Dublin. The cliffs were\
  \ astounding. I cried because I felt at peace. It was like time stood still for\
  \ a moment. The next day was probably the funniest. We went to the wrong bus stop,\
  \ missed our bus to the airport, a random taxi driver took us to the airport, our\
  \ flight was late and instead of taking 50 minutes to get to London it was a very\
  \ bumpy 25 minutes flight. We laughed, we cried, we walked an insane 10-12 miles\
  \ everyday. So my first girls trip included, laughing, walking, pained feet, potatoes\
  \ and beer. Not too shabby I say.  \n\nThe flight back to Miami was incredibly difficult...and\
  \ long...and filled with many crying babies but I did come to a few realizations.\
  \ I know everything I\u2019ve written has seemed very quick but this is the important\
  \ part. So listen up because it may not sound scholarly but it\u2019s real and honest.\n\
  1. You can take the girl out of Miami but you can\u2019t take Miami out of the girl.\n\
  2. You shouldn\u2019t let fear stop you from doing things you\u2019ve always wanted\
  \ to do.\n3. Friendship is important. Everyone seemed to be surprised that my girlfriends\
  \ and I were on a trip just because we wanted to go. I learned how important friends\
  \ are. To have people who can relate to you and how even though there\u2019s differences\
  \ of opinions it's their morals that count. Surround yourself with people who support\
  \ and build you up.\n4. I learned the meaning of home. That even though Miami doesn\u2019\
  t feel like home, home is wherever your soul feels anchored. Home is more than just\
  \ a building where you sleep. It\u2019s where you find peace and it\u2019s okay\
  \ if it\u2019s not where your family is. I\u2019m learning where mine is."
