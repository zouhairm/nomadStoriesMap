Text: "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s compelling more than living, not living a certain\
  \ dream of yours in real life can occupy your imagination until you actually live\
  \ it in reality provided that your imagination is not fragile and predictable, that\u2019\
  s partly how my still on-going journey to find my new self  has begun, I was born\
  \ in the Middle East to an immigrant family from Africa, although I never felt like\
  \ I belonged there nor to my parents place of origin, a part of me was not believing\
  \ and continued to dismiss the obvious until it was the time for me to move away\
  \ for studies, unpredictably, I ended up in south east asian city of Kuala Lumpur.\
  \  \nI didn\u2019t expect to be put in race against time to grow outside the shell\
  \ I have been living in for the past eighteen years or be left out, It startled\
  \ me to know how fast I needed to change and build a whole new person in me to face\
  \ a world I hardly know much about, a culture I barely understand, and people I\
  \ know very little about, now that I understand that such web of complexities do\
  \ face pretty much everyone at one point of their lives, but it\u2019s pretty harder\
  \ than usual if you\u2019re an introvert like me.\nBack in high school days, I had\
  \ an English teacher from New Zealand from whom I drew a good deal of inspiration,\
  \ at a chaotic place like high school it would seem rather silly to sit down a kid\
  \ at break hour to tell him words like: \u201Cnever complicate things in your future\
  \ life!\u201D, I know! they still resonate in my ears like yesterday.\nFast-forward\
  \ today, nine years and counting I\u2019m still unable to put my hands on my passion\
  \ in life, still oblivious to the early childhood dreams that linger at the back\
  \ of my head for the better,  I\u2019m just a student in the University, Maybe it\u2019\
  s good for now that I continue to be the student I feel comfortable to be.  \nFour\
  \ years went buy in a blink of an eye, I found myself ready to leave back home which\
  \ I did, belonging to a traditional family; major change in lifestyle is quite appealing\
  \ so I decided to conceal what living away has changed about me, my thoughts and\
  \ the things I want to achieve in life, nonetheless I just couldn\u2019t re-program\
  \ the brain for a new experience, it is just not how the brain works, the experiences\
  \ overlap and it is me who is beneath all of them.\nIn a remote camp once that friends\
  \ and I shared, we were three international students in a group of 30+ students.\
  \ English does bridge the communication gap to certain extent but not who you are\
  \ that concerns the others, I remained confined to my own thoughts and enjoyed the\
  \ experience, maybe because the truth is what you learn as a child surely defines\
  \ you greatly.\nAnd furthermore, you keep living experiences you do not wish to\
  \ know the outcome of, so we wrapped up the camp and returned to the usual routine\
  \ except for me, a girl I initially liked invited me with her for a short gathering\
  \ with friends and instead of spending the night together, I ended up being offered\
  \ a product to be purchased so she could earn points and lure in more customers;\
  \ Yes! Q net scammed. You don\u2019t need to laugh.\nIt\u2019s good that we have\
  \ a natural ability to learn without which we would be nothing but a bunch of fools\
  \ living in a society that doesn\u2019t progress, and my ultimate favorite is the\
  \ ability to selective forgetfulness, especially the things that shook me to the\
  \ core and the things which just happen to be a part of the usual routine, hopefully\
  \ the next country I land in holds better experiences, I think that might be the\
  \ reason why I should keep living it as it is."
