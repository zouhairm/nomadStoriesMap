Text: "\u201CRemember, the train is leaving at 8.30am from Zurich Hauptbahnhof, so\
  \ come back soon.\u201D \nThe words echoed from my (now ex-)girlfriend before meeting\
  \ my friends for \u201Cone drink\u201D. That following morning, we were off to visit\
  \ world-renowned architect, Peter Zumthor\u2019s Therme Baths in Vals (yes, I am\
  \ an archi-nerd) for a day of relaxation, overlooking the Swiss Alps. This was to\
  \ be the highlight of our trip. But, before I continue, I think this is a good time\
  \ to put this journey into perspective.\n\nThis was my first time ever out of my\
  \ home country of South Africa, in 2016, and at the age of 28, after 7 years of\
  \ studying architecture and being inspired by works from the world over. So you\
  \ can imagine the sparkle in my eye (#wanderlust) when I got the opportunity to\
  \ visit somewhere I\u2019d always imagined as a Utopian wonderland. The first city\
  \ I would visit was none other than Zurich. Yes, the pristine gem of Switzerland.\n\
  \ \nWhat would make this even more special was that at a NYE party in Cape Town,\
  \ the Mother City, I had been spotted dancing amongst the crowd by Naturklang, a\
  \ Zurich-based Techno collective. Fast forward a few weeks later, where they were\
  \ playing again, I was approached on the dance-floor, \u201CSorry, were you dancing\
  \ to Patrischa\u2019s set at the Kinky Summer NYE party?\u201D Indeed, that was\
  \ I, and boy was I dancing. My new Swiss friends invited me to join them that night,\
  \ and we would continue to share the last days of their trip to Cape Town together.\
  \ On the last night as we had our final beer, they kindly told me that if I\u2019\
  m ever in Zurich, I should definitely let them know and they\u2019d show me around.\
  \ The gesture was sweet, but for someone who\u2019d never traveled abroad, the thought\
  \ of that happening anytime soon seemed far-fetched, let alone Zurich, the land\
  \ of bankers in suits, high fashion and the most expensive High Street on the Globe,\
  \ Parade Platz. Fast forward 10 months later and, thanks to serendipitous circumstances,\
  \ here I was\u2026\n\nDespite my low-level understanding of public transport in\
  \ the First World (we like to do things differently here in \u201CAfrica\u201D),\
  \ I took to the streets to find my friends. It was November and around -1 degrees,\
  \ so for a South African, where at 15 degrees we have our scarfs on and fireplaces\
  \ on full blast with a smooth Pinotage in hand, this was not an easy task. I would\
  \ eventually arrive in Langstrasse to meet Patrischa and Felix. We caught up and\
  \ I shared my experience of Zurich so far. And as it was time to head off, Patrischa\
  \ invited me to join her and other friends I had met in Cape Town elsewhere. It\
  \ was at this point that I should have seen the deep stare my girlfriend gave me\
  \ whenever I messed up. BUT being overwhelmed by the experience and with the fearless\
  \ phrase \u201CYOLO\u201D ringing in my ears, it was an easy yes! The more bars\
  \ we visited, the more I lost track of my surroundings, and the place where I was\
  \ staying. After somehow finding myself at a masked themed party, it was then I\
  \ knew I had to get home. \n\nIt was 6am now as I got out the club. Walking to the\
  \ nearest tram stop, I tried to see how to get home but it seemed like an algorithm\
  \ of complexity that I could not compute. With no-one in sight, I began to panic.\
  \ It was cold and dark. Time was moving. But I kept walking until I saw someone\
  \ at the next tram stop. Not surprisingly, a Rabbi, as this was the Jewish-suburb\
  \ of Wiedikon where we were staying.  He was so helpful and friendly, and offered\
  \ me directions which would get me home. I couldn\u2019t be happier as I got home\
  \ at 7.15 to stumble into bed. All my girlfriend said was, \u201Cyou\u2019re an\
  \ idiot but glad you\u2019re back in time\u201D. With little to no sleep, we got\
  \ up, and set way for a day that was truly remarkable. It was all worth it in the\
  \ end. And there began my hunger for travel."
