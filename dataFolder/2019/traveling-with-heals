Text: "From the moment I slipped on my mesh tight fit Nike tennis shoes, to the crampy\
  \ flight seats,  I knew I signed up for an adventure of a lifetime. Little did I\
  \ know, that traveling to the holy land would bring so much clarity and awareness\
  \ in my own life. \n\nYou know how they say it\u2019s 5\u2019 o clock somewhere,\
  \ well it was definitely 5\u2019 o clock when I landed in Tel Aviv, and yes, I was\
  \ on the hunt for a glass of the purest Israeli red wine and organic olive oil filled\
  \ paprika hummus. My stomach was ready for a traditional mid evening Israeli snack,\
  \ so I had to make it out of the airport swiftly in order to catch a taxi to Haifa.\
  \ My mind was telling me portion control, but my stomach was telling me otherwise.\
  \ I eventually made it out of the airport, and was ready to make an arduous journey\
  \ to Haifa- the hummus bar region of Israel. Not only was I intrigued by the idea\
  \ that Haifa is widely known for its hummus bars, but that hummus is served for\
  \ every meal. I then came to terms that I\u2019d be a walking chickpea by the end\
  \ of my two week journey in Israel. Seriously. \n\nFour hours later...\nTransportion\
  \ to Haifa from Tel Aviv was a challenge, but I had the upmost faith that once I\
  \ arrived at my hotel I would be on the hunt for a  kosher dinner. Now, I don\u2019\
  t have any preferences as I am not allergic nor picky when it comes to food. However,\
  \ I will say this- most of the food options, if not all food options in Israel is\
  \ kosher. In other term, it is as organic and local as it can ever be. Score for\
  \ me, because organic, kosher, and local scream my first, last, and middle name.\
  \ I was mesmerized by how farm to table is the way of life in the entire region\
  \ of Israel. Healthy habits such as farm to table have carried with me since my\
  \ childhood. I was excited to learn that this was a part of Israel too- tasty, flavorful,\
  \ organic, farm to table cuisine. \n\nWhen it comes to traveling culture and cuisine\
  \ fall hard on my ranking lists. I want to learn as much as I can about the people,\
  \ the daily routine and habits, the culture, and the artisans that run a community.\
  \ Health and wellness have a big chunk of my life, and I intend to focus my energy\
  \ on what brings  me the most of that. I took a leap of faith when I decided to\
  \ travel to the Holy Land, and little did I know that so much of Israel\u2019s culinary\
  \ scene revolves around nourishing and feeding the body with enriching foods. Foods\
  \ that allow your taste pallets to smile and thank you,  but also deliver many health\
  \ benefits to allow changes at a cellular and molecular level. \n\nI booked my travels\
  \ to Israel with the intention of educating myself about the cultures history. I\
  \ felt that I needed time to meditate and recharge my body by submerging myself\
  \ in a culture that continuously prides themselves with love and acceptance. I allowed\
  \ myself to absorb the positive experiences, which included visiting the Western\
  \ Wall. I did not expect to see so many children, men and woman seeking love and\
  \ acceptance. This was a heartwarming experience as I too was able to experience\
  \ the emotions of what it means to be at the Western Wall. I had never experienced\
  \ the overwhelming feelings that were rushing through my mind and body. I felt cleansed,\
  \ and recharged. The funny part is that it didn\u2019t involve me purchasing a monthly\
  \ pass to a yoga studio. I was able to get those same effects by being  at the Western\
  \ Wall and eating Israeli cuisine. Taking a  leap to the unknown, allowed me to\
  \ connect and make local connections with Israelis. I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ the mental clarity that I did by traveling to the Holy Land and visiting my brothers\
  \ and sisters. I intended to continue expanding my horizons by traveling the world\
  \ and loving people unconditionally."
