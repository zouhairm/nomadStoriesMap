Text: "What do New York, Rio de Janeiro, Montevideo, Buenos Aires have in common?\
  \ They are the points on the navigation route from Europe to America, to finish\
  \ in the different countries of the \u201CNew World\".Portuguese, Spanish, French,\
  \ Italian, German and many more embarked with the hopes of leaving behind wars,\
  \ hunger, misfortunes.\nThe Portuguese immigration in Argentina was lower -quite\
  \ a lot- than Brazil, seeming that it does not exist, nevertheless it is a present\
  \ collectivity and with a rich history. But how was the departure of these immigrants\
  \ to a country of great Spanish tradition? Where did they come from, what were their\
  \ stories, and what does the country that hosted the ancestors remember?\nPortugal\
  \ has a vast shipping tradition, with great captains and determined sailors, who\
  \ increased the Portuguese crown, in the years of the conquest, to then give way\
  \ to colonies on several continents. Stories seek their momentand meet, and the\
  \ 21st century, where global communication seems to blur borders, is where problems\
  \ of discrimination, immigration and search are most evident. The importance of\
  \ rescuing stories, individual and group voices with adventures, avatars of travelers\
  \ who left their homes, their families in a changing and erratic world.\nIn addition\
  \ to the stories of the travelers, there are the behind the scenes: the ships and\
  \ their crew, the shipping companies, the ports and their workers, the consulates,\
  \ the authorities in charge of carrying out the papers, of notes, a background that\
  \ required effort and hours of dedication. The cities by their ports of great importance\
  \ were the lighthouse of traffic to set sail for America. \nCompa\xF1\xEDa Trasatl\xE1\
  ntica Espa\xF1ola, Compa\xF1\xEDa Transmediterr\xE1nea, and the case of Trasatlantic\
  \ Company -biggest ship company-, which has its archives almost untouched andare\
  \ located in Madrid, has invaluable and rich information on the ships, destinations,\
  \ arrivals, origin and destination of thousands of people until the second half\
  \ of the last century.\nThe journey, that unique experience of facing the unknown,\
  \ of meeting and satiating the desires of astonishment: journey of adventures, journey\
  \ of knowledge of the other and of oneself, journey of search and understanding,\
  \ impulsive or impelled journey, journey of exile, delayed journey, light or laden\
  \ journey, endless ways and the sensation of the new is always to come. \nThis trip\
  \ will narrate Portuguese life andthe connection with immigration: fishermen, shipowners,\
  \ old sea lions, new sailors and the horizon of America as a background and ever-present\
  \ landscape. Characters such as Vasco Da Gama, Am\xE9rico Vespucio, Fernando Pessoa,\
  \ Jos\xE9 Saramago; the artisan wine of Oporto, Coimbra and its medieval past, Sintra\
  \ with its enchanted palaces, Lisbon the \u201Cnew\" capital and Catholic kings.\
  \ Everything seems to be known, however, hundreds of history are waiting."
