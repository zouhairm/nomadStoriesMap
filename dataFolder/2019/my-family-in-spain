Text: "One year ago, I took part in a contest of video-making about Spain and obtained\
  \ an opportunity as a reward to travel in Spain during the summertime with free\
  \ accommodation. I lived with a Spanish family for two weeks. During this period,\
  \ I totally fitted in and made a good relationship with them.\n\nIt was my first\
  \ time to go abroad alone, and it wasn\u2019t an easy thing for me to mix with the\
  \ locals. We communicated with each other in Spanish along with several gestures.\
  \ It was hard for us to understand each other at first. However, the obstacle of\
  \ language didn\u2019t become a block between us. What I didn\u2019t expect was,\
  \ after 14 days, I felt at home in the little family of \u201Cthree\u201D. It should\
  \ have been a lonely trip with no companion, but fortunately it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\
  It was a single-parent family with a 13-year-old girl Gabriela as well as her mom\
  \ Patricia, who was also my \u201Cmom\u201D in Spain. Ana was in her summer vacation,\
  \ so she could stay with me all the time. Her father was a Mexican and didn\u2019\
  t live with them. \n\nIn those two weeks, I lived in the room of Gabriela, which\
  \ was almost perfect in every detail: a lovely carpet with patterns of matches,\
  \ a dinosaur doll on the windowsill, a small bed near the window, which was soft\
  \ and comfortable. The whole house was just like a work of art. Patricia was an\
  \ architect and she decorated all the rooms in an exquisite way: home-made rugs\
  \ in front of the porch, delicate adornments on the wall, vigorous plants in the\
  \ balcony. There were lots of pebbles and conches in the bathroom, and Patricia\
  \ told me that those were picked up by her and Gabriela on the beach in the summer\
  \ of the previous year. \n\nIn the daytime, Patricia went to work and I attended\
  \ classes of the summer camp. At around 13 o\u2019clock I went back home for lunch\
  \ with Gabriela. Spaniards eat later than people in most countries: breakfast at\
  \ about 10 o\u2019clock in the morning, lunch at 13 o\u2019clock in the afternoon\
  \ and dinner at 22 o\u2019clock at night. At first I wasn't used to the diet, I\
  \ often got hungry, and then I would have some fruits before dinner. I had to bargain\
  \ with my stomach to accommodate the new schedule. In the evening, Patricia liked\
  \ watching TV while Gabriela was sitting in her arms. \n\nThere\u2019s no need to\
  \ describe those traditional foods which have been mentioned millions of times in\
  \ my textbook (seafood rice, tacos, hash browns, etc. ), but there\u2019s such a\
  \ special one that I must refer to \u2014 some kind of stuff that I had never heard\
  \ before: apple-banana paste. It\u2019s easy to make it: put apples and bananas\
  \ together and squeeze them into paste. Somehow it tastes quite good, sweet and\
  \ aromatic, with a soft texture. Even after I returned to China, I make this food\
  \ frequently and share it with my friends. As long as I eat it, I just feel as if\
  \ I\u2019m still in Spain with Patricia and Gabriela.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that\
  \ it is a wonderful experience for a girl who had never been in other countries\
  \ alone to live in an unknown country 8,000 miles away from her hometown. But I\
  \ was not alone \u2014 Patricia and Gabriela were just like my family. \n\nBefore\
  \ returning to China, Patricia drove me to the airport and hugged me, we cheek-kissed\
  \ each other and said goodbye. She told me that, if one day I went back to Spain,\
  \ her house is my home. \u201CYou are welcome at any time.\u201D"
