Text: '''The death that you can''t escape from has come'' , this is what I thought
  when family forced me to go and study in India,the semi-continent country with a
  diversity of languages and cultures, how could an African guy live there?! How could
  we manage a plenty of languages when we used to find it a great job when we manage
  2 languages, a lot of questions were being asked and hocus pocus were going on  in
  my mind, and when it was my first day and first moment in Bangalore,  the rhythm
  of (kannada) rocked the the  symphony of (hindi) of the passengers and immigration
  policemen sounds piecered my ears, it seemed very difficult to survive in this country,
  they themselves were not uniting in the language, how could a person of another
  mother tongue and that too is Arabic to manage it in the rural part of Bangalore
  side where English wasn''t popular enough there to make everyone a fluent speaker,
  it all seemed difficult and the surrender vibes started invading my brain, but a
  small part was fighting for staying, days were going like a days go in a city which
  had an earthquake, the connection was very poor with my classmates, i darined all
  the expedients to connect with people, and i was eventually inspired by some people
  from Kerala speak my language, which was the the lost clue for me, how could I forget?!
  Local language always remain the best way to connect with people and make a good
  friendship with them. And it wasn''t a wrong logic at all, I could see the difference
  when I started with a prosaic words of ( how are you) and (I''m good) in a dozen
  of local languages and a diverse phrases, it seemed creepy and boring for people
  to hear their languages coming out of my tongue improperly, I remember some people
  used to turn into English with me but they were few, some used to appreciate my
  attempts of approaching them by using a similar language, and the glorious people
  were the ones who helped me to stand on my own foot and correct me to reach the
  fluency level, now it took another path, the linguaphile character of me started
  coming out, I had to go to Delhi for a fluent and good Hindi vocabularies, and I
  had to visit Kerala and Tamil Nadu for a better Malayalam and Tamil respectively,  the
  connectivity has become easier, my classmates started admiring the idea of using
  their mother tongue to make connection easier, I started going though the region
  of each mate in my class even my foreign mates, and grab a couple sentences of their
  own languag to make the communication easier and smoother, and with the speed of
  light, my 4 years of pharmacy Course have completed, but my passion for language
  never been done, the friends became more, and the approaching has become easier,
  I joined for postgraduate studies, and I could get more friends and approaching
  them wasn''t as difficult as before, my gratitude for the people who inspired me
  with their multi-languages skills, and for those who helped me to improve my fluency,
  I wasn''t expecting that India (the country of incredibilty) would turn my life
  from a small extent into an endless one, that hole which I thought my life would
  complicate there, brought me up with a wanderlust passion, friendly soul, an open-minded
  personality, and of course linguaphile tongue. The attempt was the best to mystify
  and obfuscate the doubt of the unknown'
