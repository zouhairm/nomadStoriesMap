Text: "Daybreak inched across the rooftops in a lazy yawn, nudging Akmal and I awake\
  \ over our steaming cups of tea. Today, Akmal and I were taking the train to Samarkand.\
  \ Akmal had never been. Exploring one\u2019s cultural, earthly inheritance was not\
  \ as highly prized as it was in the West, and trips to Silk Road sights required\
  \ money. So today, the westerner sweating over her breakfast would offer the Easterner,\
  \ enviously sweat-free in his boxers, a glimpse into his country\u2019s heritage.\
  \ \n\tThe train was a charming, dilapidated carriage. Every element of our private\
  \ compartment was endearing, except for for the smell. The stench of sweat combined\
  \ with lack of ventilation was overpowering. I held my breath until my senses adjusted.\
  \  \n\tWe rattled along the bumpy tracks as the Uzbek countryside unfolded in wide,\
  \ parched vistas. Our caravan cut through light vegetation, remote mudbrick houses,\
  \ hunched agricultural workers with faces as seasoned as the earth, and livestock\
  \ panting under the sun. The blue sky stretched out around us, limitless and serene.\
  \ \n        The train arrived by late morning and we emerged wrinkled and sleepy.\
  \ We squinted into the harsh sunlight. Akmal asked the locals for directions to\
  \ the Registan in Uzbek. Did I mention we could only speak in limited Russian? Our\
  \ threads of communication stemmed from theatre school and pure adoration of the\
  \ other: we generated our own language. \n        Then it hit us, halting our gait\
  \ midair. The regal, timeless, resonance of the Registan. We stood and stared, our\
  \ feet covered in dust, our eyes wide and bright. Translated from Uzbek, Registan\
  \ means \"sand place\" and Akmal and I felt our earthly presence stretched in wonder\
  \ from the caked ground to the turquoise domes. The minarets guided the pillars\
  \ of our spirits up towards the sky. \n       We wandered around gazing at the ornate\
  \ fa\xE7ade of the Madrasahs, especially the nuanced, detailed portals. At the gateway\
  \ to Ulugbek Madrasah, I shook Akmal\u2019s arm underneath the galaxy of 10-pointed\
  \ stars. The hues of blue above us left me speechless. I could finally tell Akmal,\
  \ born in a doubly landlocked country, that this was what the ocean looks like.\
  \ A deep, opulent, emotional blue.\n       We bopped between sites, stealing kisses\
  \ between the sandstone, sauntering into shops and trying on tea-cozy hats. We strolled\
  \ through Siab bazaar, tasting the juiciest pomegranates to the ripest almonds.\
  \ The Samarkand lipioshka (Uzbek bread) beckoned us and we hurried over to the steaming\
  \ orbs huddled underneath blankets like infants. The gold teeth of the merchants\
  \ sparkled in slips of light as we bartered for two lipioshkas plucked straight\
  \ from the tandyr.  \t\t\n       We settled on the next chaikhana (teahouse) and\
  \ ordered green tea under a canopy of cherry blossoms. Akmal poured the tea into\
  \ the piala (cup) and back into the flowered teapot as per Uzbek tradition. Exhaling\
  \ in our oasis, we clutched pieces of lipioshka as tenderly as we held the other\u2019\
  s gaze. \n       On the ride home, Akmal took one of my journals and began writing\
  \ about our trip in Uzbek, refusing to translate. I caught a few words: Samarkand,\
  \ kozlar (eyes), sevaman (love). Over the past few months, Akmal repeated a phrase\
  \ that I absorbed as gibberish, but the moment I felt the click of clarity - it\
  \ was always a visceral experience grasping a word or phrase - a deluge of emotion\
  \ fooded my limbs. Men seni sevaman, or I love you, had me falling for Akmal before\
  \ I knew what it meant, before we could fully communicate with language, but like\
  \ the stars on the Madrasah portals, the points of connection between us generated\
  \ an emotional tapestry. We spoke in the feeling of blue, leaving the letters to\
  \ follow and slide into place in their own time. \n        The train rocked while\
  \ the sun set over the landscape. We pummeled further into the dark throat of night.\
  \ The mysticism of the day steeped into our mortal limbs stretched across the seats.\
  \ Akmal and I locked our kozlar across the carriage, flushed with sevaman, churning\
  \ the energy between us. We lay across from one another like two pillars of a Madrasah\
  \ portal winding up, ready to host the galaxy of our own budding legend, in every\
  \ hue of blue."
