Text: "When Alice Liddell went to Wonderland, it was less a leap into the unknown\
  \ and more of an accidental stumble.  I felt similar when I was accepted to do a\
  \ short-term exchange to Germany for six weeks.\n  \nIn the wake of an existential\
  \ crisis, I was frantically obsessing over my own worth as an adult, since whenever\
  \ I had a problem, my first instinct was to call my mother. Admittedly, such a response\
  \ is hardly uncommon amongst young adults but it made me feel overly dependent and\
  \ I worried about what I would do when I was older.\n \nUltimately it all came down\
  \ to one question; What do I want to do in the next year?\n\nEurope; the land of\
  \ fairy tales. To a young Australian, it was a faraway land where princes and princesses\
  \ lived and magic danced throughout the landscape \u2013 a real Wonderland. Perhaps\
  \ this was a distorted perspective but it was nonetheless, my dearest dream to experience\
  \ it.\n \nI searched for a course to do, wrote an application and yet I somehow\
  \ never comprehended the idea that I would actually be accepted. Like Lewis Carrol's\
  \ famous character, I stared down into the unknown, tittering on the edge, and wondered\
  \ what I would find if I went deeper. My 'leap', so to say, was just a fall that\
  \ I had doubted would ever happen.\n\nAnd so, I found myself in the middle of a\
  \ train station in Stuttgart, Germany with nothing but my bulky luggage to keep\
  \ me company. People swam around me, the clicks of their heels stamping in a quick\
  \ tempo and their voices rushing together in an orchestra of harsh and confusing\
  \ sounds that I couldn\u2019t understand. Colourful decorations and posters dominated\
  \ my vision, advertising some product or other, and yet I couldn\u2019t read a single\
  \ word.\n\nIn that moment, I was Alice Liddell; falling down a rabbit hole, the\
  \ posters and people blurring around me as I plummeted, into this strange and unknown\
  \ world where nothing made sense. A world where English was not the mainstream,\
  \ where my rough, Australian mannerisms were \u2018uncultured\u2019 and where I\
  \ was completely alone. It was as exhilarating as it was absolutely terrifying.\n\
  \nMy Host Mother, a cheerful and loving woman, caught me with the biggest hug and\
  \ my preconceived stereotype of the \u2018Stoic\u2019 German, born from viewing\
  \ too many American films, were instantly shattered. All my panic on being culturally\
  \ inadequate were washed away. Germany, and to a greater extent Europe, was still\
  \ this new and unknown world that I had fallen into \u2013 where the languages were\
  \ many and the cultures were alien \u2013 but I felt ready to discover it. I was\
  \ no longer an \u2018uncultured\u2019 Australian girl, dependent on her mum, but\
  \ an adult enjoying the challenges of Europe. \n\nAs Alice Liddell explored Wonderland\
  \ so did I explore Europe; visiting Paris and Utrecht as well. One of my favourite\
  \ activities was buying all the pastries I could afford from the delightful bakeries\
  \ throughout Europe. Oddly enough, this was simultaneously the most frightening\
  \ experience as I had the unfortunate luck of only ever visiting the bakeries that\
  \ had no English speaking servers. Initially, this led to me awkwardly tripping\
  \ over my own tongue, struggling to remember any German words, before I eventually\
  \ just pointed to what I wanted and said \u201CDas, bitte\u201D. You can imagine\
  \ my absolute glee when, by the end of the trip, I was joking with the servers in\
  \ German and semi-following the conversation. All it had taken was that first stumble\
  \ \u2013 that first leap \u2013 into the unknown.\n\nOne might expect that my earlier\
  \ idealisation of the \u2018magic\u2019 of Europe would be replaced with a more\
  \ realistic perspective but my trip only served to reinforce it. Australia is a\
  \ relatively young country and geographically isolated from most of the world. In\
  \ comparison, it is impossible to extract the rich, multicultural history from the\
  \ European landscape. Every building, sculpture and artwork is entrenched in years\
  \ of history, with countless wars and reformations having ravaged the continent\
  \ over millennia. And yet there I stood, watching the cities of Stuttgart, Utrecht\
  \ and Paris breathe; an atmosphere so bright and vivacious and alive \u2013 how\
  \ could that not be magical?"
