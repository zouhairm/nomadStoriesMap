Text: "I was fortunate enough to spend 27 months imbedded in a country learning about\
  \ the cultures and life through the Peace Corps. Here is my powerful experience\
  \ of making a local connection.\nGuests are very different from what I am culturally\
  \ used to in the US. Macedonians have guests weekly. Spending the night at someone\u2019\
  s house is considered normal and expected. It\u2019s a world full of sleepovers\
  \ for everyone. Family and family guests are valued and considered the most important\
  \ time investment. Everyone values family over anything else. I think it is something\
  \ beautiful and important because the support and sense of community is felt by\
  \ everyone\u2013which is absent in some Western cultures.\nToday I made a local\
  \ connection that was unique and powerful. In the country of Macedonia there are\
  \ ethnic tensions between Albanians and Macedonians. There are always exceptions\
  \ to the rules and I witness the exception today. I was invited to a mysafir (guest\
  \ visit). I don\u2019t particularly enjoy mysafirs that I have been to before because\
  \ most of the time it\u2019s a gathering of women that just complain about their\
  \ lives, the prices, and all the weddings going on. This is prevalent in each culture:\
  \ venting sessions. I just struggle at relating to them and their struggles. I tend\
  \ to drift off in my head and find myself staring at the walls. \nDetermined to\
  \ make a local connection, I entered the house of the hostess, who is the Macedonian\
  \ language teacher for the Albanian students(the school system in Macedonia separates\
  \ ethnic Albanians and Macedonians but require Albanians to learn Macedonian). I\
  \ was greeted by two girls about my age that eagerly spoke to me in nearly fluent\
  \ English. This put a grin instantly on my face because now I would be able to at\
  \ least talk to them about their lives at a deeper level since there was no language\
  \ barrier. Trying to eye-out a good seat that would allow me to extend my legs without\
  \ being squished by small tables ( I will probably be there for 5 hours). \nSuddenly,\
  \ I was face-to-face with a woman that was enthusiastically speaking Macedonian\
  \ to me. My Macedonian was very limited and my Albanian was semi-fluent because\
  \ I lived with Albanians. I told her in Albanian that my Macedonian is dreadful\
  \ because I live with Albanians. She just blankly stared at me. I felt my cheeks\
  \ turn red and I hurriedly apologized in Macedonian that I thought she was Albanian\
  \ I know little Macedonian because I work in an Albanian community, all in Macedonian.\
  \ She died from laughter. Then she lectured me, like every Macedonian I have ever\
  \ met, that I should continue to learn Macedonian because I live in Macedonia, not\
  \ Albania. Then I told her that I agree, I live in Macedonia, but since I live with\
  \ Albanians, my volunteer service is centered around serving them. She was surprised\
  \ at my confidence and agreed that the two languages are hard to learn at the same\
  \ time.\nThe next two hours I switched my Albanian language brain and Macedonian\
  \ brain constantly. The way all eight women at the mysafir embraced both languages\
  \ and tried to include everyone was something so special I could not classify the\
  \ feeling inside my guts. What I witnessed was not only multi-ethnic, but multi-religious.\
  \ They talked about the Easter holiday and the Qur\u2019an. Then,  together we all\
  \ ate Pet (a type of bread/burek that has spinach and onions in it). All the women\
  \ ate this food happily with laughter and jokes. I wanted to capture this sense\
  \ of content livelihood. \nAfter the simple, but joyous meal, I talked for two hours\
  \ with the two young daughters that were practically fluent in English. We discussed\
  \ many liberal topics: gender roles, education for women, how girls should be told\
  \ they are smart (not beautiful), music, and what they want to do with their futures.\
  \ I then proceeded to stay connected with the two young women. Throughout the rest\
  \ of my time in Macedonia they showed me the beauty and complexity of their country."
