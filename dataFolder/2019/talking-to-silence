Text: "It was just one of the nights I have always enjoy living, my heart was at peace;\
  \ the pace of its rhythm was steady, so calm that I did not realize that it exists\
  \ in my chest. Swinging as the air did, wrapping but expanding to surrounding. \
  \ Nature has always mesmerized me; I always feel it trying to communicate to me,\
  \ struggling to tell me that the view I am cherishing with my naked eye is not only\
  \ that I can relish, if I open my mind hold my chest wide, I will be able to embrace\
  \ the unseen beauty of the events that has been occurring over time and gave that\
  \ place its specific look. I feel tranquilized recalling the  moment I was  in \
  \ middle of highway:11pm, Pakistan  is known for its high mountainous lands, in\
  \ those days I was living in Islamabad, it is a city of Pakistan, located on a higher\
  \ level compared to few other renowned cities of the same country. This city was\
  \ close to places situated on mountains, people lived there of course, but they\
  \ stayed a bit disconnected to the hustle of casual life; they lived in peace. It\
  \ was like a two hours\u2019 drive to highland called Muree, it is loved for its\
  \ privilege of being placed in an environment that is not very cold and is never\
  \ warm. I liked it in night, the reason being the roads running silent, calmness\
  \ taking over the whole area, and fewer people crossing. I rarely went up to the\
  \ actual place. The highway was my addiction, it was rough and curvy, but was held\
  \ in esteem, perfectly placed, having no better way to exist. Winters in that exact\
  \ spot were colder than it can ever be in any other place. Standing there looking\
  \ at all the lights of nearby Islamabad, Smoking my favorite cigarettes, I did not\
  \ for a moment feel the lack of a lover, it was complete. The trees were high, sharing\
  \ all the events they witnessed, of the cat that gave birth two years back and still\
  \ visited the place, the couple who kissed for the first time, the stormy rain,\
  \ which caused a family to leave the world because of the slippery edge and their\
  \ vehicle slipped off.  But now the place was quite as ever, holding its secrets,\
  \ with pride. The moon was not visible, stars over that area dominated all sort\
  \ of beauty, despite of presence of lights, stars were shining brightest, smiling\
  \ and ensuring that bad  nights never last forever, Wind that blew whistled the\
  \ anthems old people who invaded the place, they spoke other languages, worshipped\
  \ fire, wore feathers and loved peace.  Wind missed those residents; they enchanted\
  \ the mountains, the rocks and sand. They danced in nights, they spent days figuring\
  \ out their purpose, those people protected the essence of world.\nAll things around\
  \ me were talking about stories from different times, eras, this ability of nature;\
  \ to digest everything but keep memorizes of is what makes me want to stay in an\
  \ ecstatic state, believing in wildest thoughts, imagining the unthinkable, writing\
  \ the incommunicable. The cigarettes burned and I stayed in conversation until it\
  \ was morning."
