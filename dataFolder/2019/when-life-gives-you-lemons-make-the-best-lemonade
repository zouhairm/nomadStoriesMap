Text: "One of my best travel stories is when I did my first international travel:\
  \ \n\nAfter months of paperwork, I was finally at the airport, the big day arrived\
  \ and with it the realization I was actually leaving for a year to study.\n\nTears\
  \ and smiles were spilled and finally said my goodbyes to board a plane that would\
  \ take me to the UK.\n\nMinutes after the check-in, my plane got delayed. \u201C\
  Nothing to worry about, everything will be ok\u201D. Knowing I had a connection\
  \ in Frankfurt. \n\nAfter 11 hours, I found myself landing in Germany. The minute\
  \ my feet touched the airport I had 30 min to board the plane that would take me\
  \ to Manchester. I ran like my life depended on it but I made it, even the plane\
  \ was delayed too, lucky me. \n\nI landed, and after an extensive interview with\
  \ migration, I finally entered the country. The university had sent a car to pick\
  \ me up, but after all the delayed time I wasn\xB4t sure anymore. It was 2011, technology\
  \ was \u201Chaving a BlackBerry\u201D, and I had none. So I waited and waited, looking\
  \ at the signs trying to see my name in them. Nope, nothing. \n\nI went outside\
  \ and also nothing. I was getting worried, with no phone signal and no Internet.\
  \ I was on my own in a country where everything was so unfamiliar. \n\nIt was getting\
  \ dark and decided to get going, I needed to get to Chester and I was just one hour\
  \ from there. The easiest thing, ask for a cab! Unfortunately, it was too expensive.\n\
  \nI asked the person in the cab station, how could I get to Chester? And she replied\
  \ in a very tick northern accent: \"by train or coach\" (coach?). \n\nI followed\
  \ the signs and made it to the train station. Here is the thing, when you come from\
  \ Mexico, you're not used to trains; there is one train for people and it\xB4s just\
  \ for tourists. So I had no idea how to board one. And at 7 pm I was getting worried\
  \ the university was going to close. People behind me were waiting and I felt this\
  \ was not the time to learn how to ride a train, so I quit and went looking for\
  \ the famous \u201Ccoach\u201D.\n\nArriving at the coach station I noticed, coach\
  \ means just a bus. In the last hour, I could barely understand what the people\
  \ were talking about, I felt as if I was listening to another language, the words\
  \ they used were all new and I was so impressed, I couldn\xB4t even form a decent\
  \ sentence when talking. \n\nThe office was closed, so I asked around if this was\
  \ the place to wait for the bus to Chester. They said yes, good! The coach arrived\
  \ and people started to load their bags, I waited until the end to avoid the judgment\
  \ of my heavy load. I greeted the bus driver and gave him a twenty-pound bill, he\
  \ looked up at me very serious and told me: \u201CIt\xB4s 8 quid I\xB4ve got no\
  \ change\u201D. \n\nUntil this day I am amazed by the power of non-verbal communication.\
  \ Because I showed my most defeated face and he just chuckled moving his head and\
  \ saying: \u201CJust, get up\u201D. Relieved I got in the free ride that was offered.\
  \ \n\nAfter more than an hour, we finally arrived at Chester! I started to drag\
  \ my bag looking for a cab, but at the time, I didn\xB4t know you can\xB4t just\
  \ grab a cab you have to call it. A woman passing by saw me so confused that decided\
  \ to approach me and offered to call one for me. I waited until a very clich\xE9\
  \ cab arrived and told him where I was going. \n\nAnd there I was after 2 hours\
  \ of adventures I made it to the university! Which was closed... But luckily someone\
  \ was waiting for me!\n\nEvery time, I think about this story I smile because it\
  \ taught me so much about myself and people in general. How a smile can break any\
  \ language barrier. How the adversity means you need to thrive."
