Text: "I\u2019ve been travelling around the world as long as I can remember, but it\
  \ hasn\u2019t been until the last decade that I consider travelling as a spiritual\
  \ experience. I believe, if it is a \u201CCalling\u201D, I shall honour by visiting\
  \ and grow along the journey. \n\nTravelling to Everest Base Camp and the high passes\
  \ was my first trekking experience. I signed up for it not knowing why. I completed\
  \ the self-assigned ambition in November 2018 as I promised myself two years ago\
  \ that 2018 would be the year. \n\nI was the last to reach camp; I had blaring migraines,\
  \ headaches, nose bleeds etc. from day dot but took each day as it came. I made\
  \ it because I was wanted to see and hear what the mountains had to say but above\
  \ it was my Sherpa guide Nurpu wanted to see me succeed & complete the trek. \n\n\
  He assisted by carrying my DSLR, daypack when he could and walked with me patiently\
  \ when I was struggling with altitude. To encourage, he would say, didi (sister\
  \ in Hindi), \u201Conly half an hour more\u201D! I was aware that it wasn\u2019\
  t the right answer but it was the most encouraging response. He and I became buddies\
  \ over 18 days. We shared our personal life journeys and exchanged cultural experiences.\
  \ He shared Sherpa stories and how hard the porters worked and made little money,\
  \ but the stories were always positive & heart-warming never manipulative. \n\n\
  He always had my back, whether it was making sure I ate enough, hydrated on trek,\
  \ or holding my hand while I was feeling dizzy ascending and descending over rocks.\
  \ He was always with me like my shadow. I felt an earthly angel was sent my way.\
  \ While ascending Cho La pass (2nd high pass), my ice cleats got entwined, I slipped\
  \ & was hanging off the cliff, luckily he grabbed me by one hand and another Sherpa\
  \ from the back. I don\u2019t really recollect much of this but somehow they managed\
  \ to pull me up and I escaped death. Moments like these make you believe that people\
  \ are sent in your life for a purpose, reason and higher purpose; sometimes we just\
  \ don\u2019t see it clearly as we are not always open to receive. \n\nWhile trekking\
  \ over Renjo La Pass (3rd high pass) he got me my favourite Coconut Crunch biscuit.\
  \ He said \u201CI knew you would like it and would get hungry\u201D. I was, running\
  \ low on fuel and energy and terribly sick of eating my energy bars and gel pods\
  \ by then. I was told I had to earn it; and would be given the cookies as a celebration\
  \ of making it to the top. We both made it and celebrated that moment with coconut\
  \ crunchies and photos. \n\nOn the last day while returning from Namche to Lukla\
  \ I said, \u201Cfrom tomorrow you will have no one to tell \u201Conly \xBD hour\
  \ more\u201D and we both laughed and he said, and \u201Cyou will not have to hear\
  \ that ever again\u201D. I was in denial and didn\u2019t want the journey to end.\
  \ At the \u201Cthanking ceremony\u201D I acknowledged his selfless love a little\
  \ teary with a warm hug and a personal letter (in Hindi) with my contact details.\
  \ \n\nOver the days, I taught him photography, some English words, bargaining skills,\
  \ opening up and becoming a chatterbox. But, he taught me how to embrace every situation\
  \ with a smile, remain calm and patient even in an emergency, have faith that you\
  \ can always do it you and your tribe want you to succeed. Above all, give selflessly\
  \ without expectations or seeking adulation and rewards. \n\nI expected to make\
  \ a local connection and made a few, but I didn\u2019t expect to find a brother\
  \ (my soulmate) in the Himalayas. I\u2019m grateful to the universe for the nudge\
  \ and guiding me to honour my calling. Thanks to technology I\u2019m still in touch\
  \ via What\u2019sApp, but I prefer to surprise him once in a way by picking up the\
  \ phone and asking my favourite question: Nurpu, aur kitna time baaki hai (how long\
  \ do we have before we reach). The giggles continue, until we trek together again\
  \ one day. I'm sure the universe is listening. :)"
