Text: "Most people look for jaguars in Sri Lanka\u2019s Yala National Park. I try\
  \ not to begrudge those jammy individuals as I hunt for the glint of broken rum\
  \ bottles.\n\nIt\u2019s not wildlife we\u2019re seeking in this hinterland, but\
  \ rubbish. Armed with biodegradable sacks and a tin tuk-tuk for transport, we\u2019\
  re three mates attempting the Lanka Challenge. Traversing the teardrop island sustainably\
  \ on three wheels is our mission set by Large Minority.\n\nWe spot sparkling crisp\
  \ foils in the sun like magpies. It\u2019s a shame how little we struggle. Small\
  \ stains of human negligence tangle themselves in emerald thickets like tinsel.\
  \ Fishing newspaper sog and soleless shoes from the sand feels almost cathartic.\
  \ But we\u2019re shocked to find this stuff in a land of amber earth, big skies\
  \ and solitude. Who has put it here? And why is it all so sticky?\n\nPart of me\
  \ still wishes we were looking for beasts more beautiful than man\u2019s laziness.\n\
  \nSnagged trees stoop over us like arthritic lollipop ladies, checking we\u2019\
  re being thorough bin men. Meanwhile grasses sprout like troll\u2019s hair; scruffy,\
  \ colourful and full of secrets. Unseen creatures bleat where garish rubbish rustles.\
  \ \n\nEventually, we hear another engine\u2019s drawl. The noisy passengers of a\
  \ hatchback howl past us in delight. I guess that tuk-tuk driving tourists trophying\
  \ trash in the middle of nowhere, probably look quite funny. \n\nGlad to have entertained\
  \ and with full bags, we prepare to leave. As we turn towards our trike, we realise\
  \ we aren\u2019t what the people had been screaming about.\n\nThey\u2019d been making\
  \ a fuss about the big elephant blocking the hill ahead of us.\n\nNow here was a\
  \ real lollipop lady. No fluorescent jacket could own a crossing like this creased\
  \ grey. This beast means business.\n\nOur destination, the town of Tissamaharama,\
  \ is firmly on the other side of the hill upon which our new friend is perched.\
  \ The elephant\u2019s ears sway regally in the breeze; velvet curtains awaiting\
  \ their cue. Purposefully anchored, this animal's a showstopper.\n\nLocals later\
  \ told us that people carry decoy bananas along the Yala road. The habit causes\
  \ the animals associate traffic with tea-time. This, we're realising, is right of\
  \ way with a sweet yellow toll.\n\nBewailing our stupidity for not carrying bananas,\
  \ we smile grimly that there\u2019s nothing else for it. Piling back into our trike,\
  \ we lurch into motion, our rubbish bags jangling in alarm. We pray for a gain in\
  \ speed up the hill, whilst the elephant sits calmly at its crest. As we get closer,\
  \ it changes tack and lumbers forward, leaving us very little space to fly through.\
  \ Veering sideways to overtake, our tuk-tuk exercises its tendency to tip, threatening\
  \ to make us more parkland litter.\n\nTo any outsider, it\u2019s obvious we haven\u2019\
  t factored elephants into our collateral.\n\nFinally we\u2019re directly beside\
  \ the graceful hulk; a toy truck at the mercy of its new player. The wrinkly youth\
  \ extends its trunk, reaching so close that we\u2019re warmed by the grey curl.\
  \ As the elephant toes another trudge, the engine finds its feet and we hurtle past,\
  \ cargo avoiding contact with creature.\n\nWe wait a reasonable distance before\
  \ pulling up. After our engine\u2019s indignant squeals, the serenity of the national\
  \ park is surreal. We dance in a marmalade haze of sun and dust. A sedate peacock\
  \ ambles back towards the elephant, proving we are the anomaly in this jungle.\n\
  \nGreen swallows grey as we watch our elephant dissolve effortlessly back into the\
  \ bush. Just as easily, it had appeared from nowhere.\n\nOn our mission for rubbish\
  \ in Yala, we hadn\u2019t expected to face such a beast in the road. But of course,\
  \ there\u2019s no such thing as a road. Not in the wild. Front doors and fences\
  \ are forgotten for open land, and fierce territory frontiers which do exist are\
  \ invisible. Our lone dust track is no different to the lion\u2019s den. We are\
  \ just guests in the wild.\n\nBack in the tuk-tuk, I feel bin juice dribble down\
  \ my leg. A sickly fume of fermented rum catches in the air. But seeing as we rudely\
  \ forgot to bring bananas, I\u2019m relieved that we\u2019ve at least taken the\
  \ rubbish out for our host."
