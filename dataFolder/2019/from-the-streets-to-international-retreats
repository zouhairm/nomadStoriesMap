Text: "It all started when my mom said \u201Cwe are leaving Argentina & going away\u201D\
  . As a 9 year old kid who had his friends, family & whole life basically set, I\
  \ was all types of confused, mad, anxious as to what was going to become my life\
  \ in a country I didn\u2019t know, with a language I didn\u2019t speak & a culture\
  \ I didn\u2019t follow.\n\nWhen I got to the US on December 12, 2001, I arrived\
  \ at JFK airport in New York City to find my dad waiting for us to go \u201Chome\u201D\
  \ in a limousine. It all seemed fun and games until my parents started having marital\
  \ problems. The situation spun outta control and it landed my mom, my younger sisters\
  \ and I on the streets as a homeless family. Thanks to my mother\u2019s constant\
  \ perserverance we managed to get assessed and file a domestic violence case which\
  \ helped us move into a shelter. The whole process took about 7 years but the upside\
  \ was that we eventually got US Residency. \n\nAs soon as I received the infamous\
  \ \u201CGreen Card\u201D in August 2013 I wanted to escape reality and booked my\
  \ first trip outside the US. It was a 3-Day cruise to the Bahamas leaving from Miami.\
  \ It was the first time I traveled outside the US since I arrived in 2001. The thrill\
  \ to LIVE and experience what it was like to travel gave me new found love to discover\
  \ the rest of the world. \n\nThe new enthusiasm I received from those 3 days gave\
  \ me the inspiration to not \u201Clive to work, but work to LIVE\u201D; and that\
  \ meant going to at least 1 country each year. Since then I have traveled to South\
  \ America, Europe and Asia. I am exited to share that in 2 weeks I will be traveling\
  \ to Colombia for the first time, making it the 14th country I visit. \n\nI hope\
  \ my story inspires others to not just play in the backyard, but to go explore the\
  \ playground.\n\nThank You,\n\nHector Romero \n\n[email\_protected]"
