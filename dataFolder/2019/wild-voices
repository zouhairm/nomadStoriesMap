Text: "After 13 years of travel, I found myself in unfamiliar territory... Home. The\
  \ place where I was born and everything I was running from with only one way out.\
  \ Feeling the ache, as the expansion of my adventures was meeting the contractions\
  \ of my avoidance. The frustration and determination amidst a deeper desire for\
  \ freedom and connection had taken a leap into the unknown, stillness inviting my\
  \ mind to travel, replaying the stories of what I'd experience, absorb and tend\
  \ to throughout the day, nostalgia for unexpected encounters, meeting each new day\
  \ with the quest for making the mundane memorable, meaningful, magical, seeing the\
  \ extraordinary in the ordinary. I wondered what it was like for those who never\
  \ leave their home country, let alone their home town. I began observing nature,\
  \ people and words, listening to the whispers on the wind, weaving reality with\
  \ the unseen, life was becoming poetry. \n\nLooking back now there's no amount of\
  \ money anyone could've paid me to endure such an unraveling, yet the journey of\
  \ self-discovery transformed into a masters in self-acceptance, something I feel\
  \ we're all seeking on a deeper level. I realized I was seeking home within all\
  \ along and my travels where the key to my remembering, now I want to capture and\
  \ share the magic and medicine of the lands, the sacred wisdom and arts of its people\
  \ as an offering, an invitation to us all as we travel from the head to the heart,\
  \ heal the pain of separation and surrender to a deeper love."
