Text: "A road from Lithuania to Belarus is very much alike a road from harmony to\
  \ depression. First you sit calmly in a comfy bus, staring at tiny dollish houses,\
  \ neatly trimmed hedges and European eco autos once in a while outstripping your\
  \ bus. The closer to the border, the more darkness and frustration you feel. Almost\
  \ all the tiny houses sequence comes to an end and makes way for huge empty fields\
  \ occasionally covered by couple of lonely trees. Depression has just started to\
  \ conquer your soul.\n\nI was trapped by this depression feeling right before the\
  \ Lithuanian customhouse. Add freezing wind, total lack of sun and bodily fatigue\
  \ \u2013 and you will never get a happy person. \n\nLet me point out \u2013 all\
  \ the checking process here is organized in a quite chaotic manner. You have to\
  \ cabins \u2013 to the left and to the right \u2013 and one extremely lazy and slow\
  \ man who brings the passports from one cabin to another. I didn\u2019t catch the\
  \ logic of his labor duties and made up my mind just to let it go. \n\nWhen I left\
  \ the bus to join a line to one of the cabins, I was totally ready to yell, curse\
  \ like a sailor and throw the ball of my hate to any person around me. Suddenly\
  \ I saw her! Little, a little bit dirty, but fluffy and cozy. She was sitting right\
  \ in the middle between two cabins and waiting for the people to caress her. She\
  \ presents an isle of home like harmony at this hell subdivision. The cat!\n\nCourse,\
  \ everybody including me in a couple of seconds forgot about passport control, visas\
  \ and desires to visit friendly Belarus and started to fuzzy wuzzy her. One really\
  \ huge man even shared his equally huge sandwich with her. The atmosphere became\
  \ visibly warm thanks to this tiny wise animal. \n\nThe cat certainly had a lot\
  \ of plans besides being stroked b some group of sweaty strangers, that\u2019s why\
  \ our amusement ride quickly came to an end. \n\nThe cat left us alone to bump into\
  \ custom formalities."
