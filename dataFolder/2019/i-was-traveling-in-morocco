Text: "I was travelling in Morocco, but it still felt like Egypt. I was with an Indian\
  \ friend of mine, whom I had just met, and we were conversing about differences\
  \ between America and Canada. The royal treatment we had experienced together in\
  \ Egypt just 2 months before, had kept our bond closer than most, and by the time\
  \ we arrived in Morocco, we had been tourists on the verge of inspiration. When\
  \ we landed, we were greeted by the hot, shiny, sun. After an unbelievable double\
  \ charge flight experience in our layover, we were painstakingly exhausted, and\
  \ eager to arrive at our hostel. There, the blues, oranges, and pink, kept us warm\
  \ as the music trailed up the stairs from the lower level of our riad and echoed\
  \ against the clouds hovering just above. We slept the first night, but in the morning,\
  \ we travelled to D\u2019Ouzoud Falls, and were greeted by an interested man in\
  \ rags, who doubled as our tour guide. He provided us an innate look at the caste\
  \ system in early formation of Morocco, and kept us intrigued, as we ate lunch amongst\
  \ us, a Frenchman and his wife, and an American French girl, including myself, a\
  \ Senegalese, and that girl\u2019s own Asian friend. The next afternoon, we met\
  \ a circus of entertainers outside our riad who performed and let my friend get\
  \ henna. I sipped tea and met with some of the locals. It was an eclectic time and\
  \ the next day, as we meandered into the desert together by camel, nighttime quickly\
  \ befell us. Our guide, so sweet, had introduced us to new names of things and the\
  \ drum beat on into the night. Finally, in the morning, we took our last destination\
  \ trip all the way to the coastal region of Essaouria. The locals were giddy and\
  \ had a serene quality to them. The mistiness kept everything fresh and exciting.\
  \ I was even greeted by a Saudi man, sitting by myself, and everything again, was\
  \ calling me back to Egypt. We had travelled against the horizon, and the intimateness\
  \ was such warmth against this cool, easy, refreshment of the seamen, fish and water.\
  \ I was excited to get back to Turkey, but I couldn\u2019t wait to come back to\
  \ this area again, especially since I had been reading, in class, about the conversions\
  \ between the French and the Arabs and Spanish on these African lands. Part of the\
  \ reason I wanted to go to Morocco, was to pick up this exploration of an amalgamation\
  \ of history. Back in Turkey, it was almost time to leave as my semester was over.\
  \ But I had to take one last trip to the water. I went by bus, all the way down\
  \ the coast, to Kelebeklar Valley, where a boat picked me up by myself, and took\
  \ me around the cliff\u2019s edge into this spectacular cove of butterflies. Once\
  \ again, I found myself warm, overwhelmed by the haze in a comforting way that took\
  \ my head to sleep early. In the morning, I climbed rocks into the waterfalls and\
  \ spied the new birth of bugs and insects. The shells on the beach were crunchy,\
  \ and the water so clear and blue. I left all together, but knew I would be prepared\
  \ to come back to the Mediterranean and see these sights again. As I review my journal,\
  \ I find some of my favorite poems,\n\n\u201CI forgot my way around an area I\u2019\
  d been before so I walked to the Bosporus instead and brought some of the juiciest\
  \ oranges I\u2019ve ever had for only $1. I followed his directions a way I had\
  \ never been before by tunnel, a bus, and a tram. My adventure was saved by the\
  \ blue mosque.\u201D\n\nWhen I finished there, I was walking around and got invited\
  \ into a restaurant for tea and hummus. I already knew I was going to miss it. The\
  \ biblical sights, and furthermore, legends, and temples were so powerful and enforcing\
  \ amongst the modern architecture. My studies are still not done, but I will always\
  \ remember that trip at the end of my school year, and all the people I discovered\
  \ along the way."
