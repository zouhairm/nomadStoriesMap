Text: "The engine of the old, dusty bus had coughed into life, and I was about to\
  \ fill my ears with Spanish music, pre-selected for this twelve-hour journey, when\
  \ a woman sat next to me and introduced herself: \u201CBuenos Dias! Voy a ser su\
  \ compa\xF1era de viaje\u201D. I nodded, smiled and continued listening to my music.\
  \ Worried that my broken Spanish would make any conversation impossible, I had fallen\
  \ into the bad habit of retreating into myself and my thoughts. \n\nI noticed on\
  \ the armrest an Alfajor, a typical local sweet, put there courtesy of the bus company.\
  \ My \u2018compa\xF1era de viaje\u2019 was really enjoying hers, rolling the candy\
  \ around inside her cheeks with the relish of a toddler. Personally, I\u2019m not\
  \ into sweets, so I offered her mine. Without realizing, this gesture unexpectedly\
  \ opened a door to a conversation which my companion jumped into with delight, and\
  \ from there the real journey began. I got to know a woman who connected me to the\
  \ same land we were driving though.\n\nPaz was her name. 78 years old, Chilean,\
  \ a granny who was travelling to see her son in Argentina. She didn\u2019t care\
  \ about how basic my Spanish was, because a willingness to understand and a desire\
  \ to be understood inevitably speak the same language. She was eager to tell me\
  \ the story of the mountains, of the train tracks broken and out of use, of how\
  \ luxurious train travel was many moons ago, and of how it only took three days\
  \ for the same route back then. She also told me how dangerous it was and how many\
  \ people died in accidents. But I was not to worry today, she convinced me, we were\
  \ in safe hands on this slow bus.\n\nAt one point she wondered what a 28-year-old\
  \ guy was doing on the same rickety old bus as her, winding its way through the\
  \ Andes. So, she got to know my story. How I left my perfect job in Copenhagen to\
  \ travel the world on a shoe-string. She was impressed and touched by the fact that\
  \ I did everything on my own, without any family support. At one of the endless\
  \ stops in an unknown village, a man came onboard selling snacks. Paz bought a sandwich\
  \ and offered me half, uttering that I couldn\u2019t refuse it, as it was savory,\
  \ not sweet. Bite after bite, she told me about the colorful mountains and begged\
  \ me to take pictures to show the world its enchanted beauty. She also explained\
  \ to me how clean the river once was and how, in her youth, regularly she would\
  \ walk to the water\u2019s edge to wash clothes. As a young mother, who had her\
  \ first child at the age of 17, it was impossible for her to travel. But old age\
  \ has no place for regret she assured me and now, being old, she was happy to be\
  \ sitting on a bus and sharing her story. Following the Mendoza river, we reached\
  \ the city and got off the bus. It was hard to say goodbye to a person who had just\
  \ told me she wished I was her son.\nI gave her a kiss on the cheek, and hugged\
  \ her, but she wanted to shake hands, an odd formality that sat incongruously with\
  \ the intimacy of our time together. I noticed she gave me a bill, but I refused\
  \ it. She insisted: \u201C10,000 Chilean pesos, it is not so much. Take it as the\
  \ symbol of my support to you. Make the most out of it and remember that you will\
  \ find a lot of people taking you down at times, but others will always be on your\
  \ side.\u201D\n\nLove comes in different forms, wearing different faces and appears\
  \ for either a reason, a season or a lifetime. Without swapping telephone numbers\
  \ Paz and I said goodbye knowing that it was unlikely we would ever see each other\
  \ again. But I have our picture together, which will always remind me how special\
  \ the woman was and how, no matter where you go in life, the human need for connection\
  \ is instinctive and universal. And I don\u2019t listen to music on buses anymore."
