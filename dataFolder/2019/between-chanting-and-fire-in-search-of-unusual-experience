Text: "There\u2019s a sound I bet you\u2019ve never heard anywhere before. As the\
  \ circle of bare-chested Indonesian men sitting on the ground chant, interrupted\
  \ by the rhythmic shouts, I\u2019m so dissolved in the rhythm, that it\u2019s actually\
  \ hard to remember how it all started. If you ignore the flashing cameras, the commotion\
  \ caused by more late appearances in the audience, the outside noises, it feels\
  \ as if this chanting just flows, bathed in sunset colors of Uluwatu temple, without\
  \ the beginning or end. \n\nEven the most vivid descriptions don\u2019t do Bali\u2019\
  s famous kecak dance justice. You can read off the one-page introduction handed\
  \ to every guest before the show, that what unfolds in this circle of sound is the\
  \ story of Ramayana. Amidst dozens of chanting men, dancers in elaborate costumes\
  \ artistically reenact the tale, taking the audience through a complicated plot,\
  \ which finishes with the villain of the story in a circle of orange flames. Any\
  \ attempt to put kecak into words or take a piece of it in a photograph, though,\
  \ can\u2019t quite capture the subtle something which makes it so powerful. It\u2019\
  s almost as if carried away by the sound, the dance, the drama, you can feel for\
  \ a moment the centuries falling away, discover a distant time echoing in every\
  \ \u2018Chark-a\u2019 sound. \n\nRephrasing Colin McPhee, I too wonder, how was\
  \ it possible, that in this late day, for such music and dance to have been able\
  \ to survive? Only McPhee, whose life took a U-turn with the first sound of Balinese\
  \ music on a lent gramophone record, asked this in 1947. He also predicted sadly\
  \ that \u201CIt was only too clear such music could not survive much longer\u201D\
  . Maybe what we get today, fascinated with the island\u2019s authentic vibe, is\
  \ the mere faded memory of what traditional Balinese music and dance used to be.\
  \ Fast forward 70 years, and I\u2019d be more than happy to tell McPhee, that he\
  \ was wrong. But it\u2019s not entirely true. Even in a short span of 2 years since\
  \ I\u2019ve first seen it, I am full of nagging premonition of an unwelcome change.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThat\u2019s it?\u201D my friends ask surprised when kecak finishes too\
  \ abruptly. They\u2019d come prepared to sit through a lengthy performance, with\
  \ an equal chance of being fascinated and bored. This time, it seems short. Perhaps\
  \ it\u2019s because of the intrusions, all that coquetting with the audience, throwing\
  \ questions to the crowd. Or maybe it really got shorter, as more and more people\
  \ kept leaving in the middle over the years. As if the performers, who seemed too\
  \ absorbed in the intensity of the act to mind the audience reaction, finally gave\
  \ in. Let the audience dictate the rules, and package kecak within the neat definition\
  \ of pleasantly exotic. \n\nI remember kecak so surprisingly raw, so unapologetically\
  \ foreign, that it stroke me as an authentic experience, you come to believe only\
  \ happens to you after a deliberate search. Maybe after three days on the road into\
  \ the deepest corners of the island. Maybe, in the location which is tucked away\
  \ from the attention of mainstream travel guides, and is only passed on in the tight\
  \ circle of locals with the promise to never tell anyone. You don\u2019t expect\
  \ to find this kind of experience in such a touristic hotspot as Uluwatu temple.\
  \ \n\nIt was still good this time around, but I left the temple contemplating this:\
  \ as tourists and outsiders, we can\u2019t claim a contribution to cultural preservation.\
  \ Yet, to contradict the cruelty of our short attention span shrinking every year\
  \ among the abundance of information and things to do, \nmaybe we can make a little\
  \ extra effort. Stay a bit longer, give yourself and kecak or any other local performance,\
  \ a bit more time if you don\u2019t come to like it at once. And maybe, just maybe,\
  \ there\u2019s a surprising discovery for you and a chance to a little more authenticity\
  \ unchanged by the demands of the crowd every time we do so."
