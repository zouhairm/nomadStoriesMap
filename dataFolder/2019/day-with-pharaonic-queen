Text: "How did you get here? \"To this country that people do not know,\" Did you\
  \ come through the sky, or sail on the water'' with those words written in hieroglyphics\
  \ on the wall of the temple was impressed arrived to its peak\nAt a temperature\
  \ of more than 40 \xB0 C at 8 am in the middle of a barren desert in mid-September,\
  \ I was standing there just a few meters away. I bear witness to this miracle built\
  \ more than 3,500 years ago on the western side of Luxor, Egypt, I made sure to\
  \ install the hat well on my head in a good escape from the sun, and made sure to\
  \ catch a small bottle of water, and then I went up with a group of friends and\
  \ there were a lot of tourists of different nationalities on those large stairs\
  \ in order to approach a little of That legendary funeral temple, At the beginning\
  \ of the stairs, the tour guide began speaking, speaking in Arabic and followed\
  \ by English translation, I imagined myself there in 1501 BC when the husband of\
  \ Hatshepsut (Thutmose II) died , was Hatshepsut at the age of four and three,I've\
  \ thought that more than 35000 years ago there was an Egyptian womanThree years\
  \ older than me  she fought everyone and was granted the rule of Egypt for a period\
  \ of 22 years as the longest rule for an Egyptian woman in history.\n The temple\
  \ is composed of three consecutive floors on open balconies built entirely of limestone,\
  \ and stood in front of the columns of the second floor statues of limestone of\
  \ God Osiris and Queen Hatshepsut In a wonderful distribution, I stepped up the\
  \ stairs which separates the two levels to reach the second verandah., and it is\
  \ bordered to the right and left by a curved arched curtain. Each fence is characterized\
  \ by a beautiful inscription from inside a lion protects the queen and thus protects\
  \ the entrance to the second porch. At the end of the second floor there are two\
  \ pillars with each 22 columns \n right one has views of Holy birth of Queen Hatshepsut\
  \ and the famous Pont mission views left  , We reached capacity (left) was the temple\
  \ walls are decorated with scenes of Pont mission ' business and begin this journey\
  \ of South corner views to the bottom view that illustrates the text and picture\
  \ sailing expedition to punt ' sailing in the sea and road began to the land of\
  \ God and travel in peace to Pont,   go look in the bottom row of the south wall\
  \ and the view represents the Egyptian Envoy stood behind her desk in front of his\
  \ collection of beautiful gifts, and was mentioned the texts inscribed above the\
  \ Pont compatriots surprise for audacity Egyptian sailors ' How did you get here?\
  \ \"To this country that people do not know,\" Did you come through the sky, or\
  \ sail on the water''\nWe moved then to the adjective (right) with scenes of the\
  \ Holy birth.     So tour guide explain to us what was recorded on the walls of\
  \ the legend of Holy birth to prove that her father is the god Amun and Thutmose\
  \  was recording on its walls that Amun had ordered her Coronation. \nThis became\
  \ Queen Hatshepsut on Egypt, playing as God Horus and represented his on Earth and\
  \ taken to itself the title  ' Son of the Sun ' and even resemble the appearance\
  \ of men and wore their uniforms,\n\nWe finish the visit and my heart filled with\
  \ astonishment the achievements of Hatshepsut in ancient and took down the stairs\
  \ in my mind one question: what should I do now as an Egyptian woman to keep my\
  \ little impact on that land"
