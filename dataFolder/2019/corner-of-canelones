Text: "There I stood in the middle of the dark Uruguayan street, my legs shaking while\
  \ I clutched on to what remained of my purse. I looked at my sister; her eyes were\
  \ wide in disbelief. For a moment silence danced among us as we gazed at one another,\
  \ taking in that unforgettable moment that came and went in a blink of an eye. My\
  \ adrenaline began to subside and the aches and pains started to become apparent.\
  \ A large gaping cut on my ankle was oozing blood and my legs felt sore. I could\
  \ sense my bony knee-caps transforming into black and blue bruises under my favorite\
  \ indestructable, fitted-jeans. \n\n     I had just been robbed by a man on his\
  \ bicycle. He had slyly slipped his index finger underneath my light, fringe cross-body\
  \ bag, delicately shifted it over my shoulder and began to speed away. The bag had\
  \ my passport, phone, and every form of monetary funds that I had in my possession.\
  \ My sister's words replayed over in mind, \"Are you sure you want to bring that\
  \ nice camera with you?\" I answered, \"I want to get a nice sunset shot! It'll\
  \ be fine.\" This was our last night in South America and suddenly thoughts of being\
  \ stranded in Montevideo without anything took over my conscious. \n\n     Typically,\
  \ two young, blonde American women traveling on their own would be a great target\
  \ on a dark and unknown street. However, the mugger did not anticipate the reaction\
  \ that would soon ensue. This was a time that being an ex-state track and field\
  \ medalist and athlete worked in my favor. I am not certain how this foreign form\
  \ of bravery and energy manifested my entire being, but it did. The intense instinct\
  \ consumed my every thought and movement to the point I had lost all control. I\
  \ screamed, \"No!!!\" at the top of my lungs and sprinted towards the thief, jumping\
  \ on his back like a spider monkey. I clutched on to the neck of his shirt, slowly\
  \ choking him and kicking my legs frantically until we eventually crashed in the\
  \ center of the street. There we lay... in the middle of a four way city street,\
  \ buildings hung over us and gawkers stood there merely observing what had just\
  \ taken place. Not one soul ran out to help as I screamed and cussed hysterically,\
  \ still clutching the neck of his shirt. Paranoia overtook me and I felt as if several\
  \ \"witnesses\" were in on the robbery. I hit the thief repetitively, screaming\
  \ for my sister to grab the purse. It is as if she was a myotonic goat, conquered\
  \ by panic. Finally, as my head spun around like I had been possessed in an exorcism\
  \ film, I spotted my broken and mangled purse in the center of the bike frame and\
  \ hastily grabbed it. Before I knew what had happened, the thief disappeared. My\
  \ sister and I looked inside the purse assessing all belongings. A few pesos had\
  \ fallen roadside; other than that all my belongings had been accounted for.\n\n\
  My sister displayed an array of emotions: anger, worry, thankfulness, and pride\
  \ all at once. I had just mugged a mugger on the corner of Canelones in Montevideo,\
  \ Uruguay and escaped the incident without being stabbed or shot to death\u2026"
