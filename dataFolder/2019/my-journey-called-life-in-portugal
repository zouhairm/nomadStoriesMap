Text: "My Journey Called Life in Portugal\n\nby Abdijibar Aided Osman\n\nLittle Blond\
  \ is the name I go by now, since I arrived for the first time in my life in Portugal.\
  \ Well, that is not totally true, I visited the Lisbon region about twenty years\
  \ ago. But as much as I like this gorgeous city, which has changed enormous since\
  \ I was there before, last spring my car was on a mysterious way pulled towards\
  \ the beautiful Alentejo\u2026 and I fell in love immediately! There and then Little\
  \ Blond was born\u2026\n\nA Bit of a Hermit\n\nThe story of Little Blond starts\
  \ in the east of the Alentejo region, near the border of Spain. Very extreme weather\
  \ conditions compared to the coast line, hot in the summer -over 40 degrees Celsius-\
  \ and cold and lots of rain in the wintertime. Nevertheless, this creates a very\
  \ nice variety of flora and fauna. And even people I might add. You can hike or\
  \ bike -not really my thing due to much altitude- for hours and not encounter another\
  \ human being. So more nature and less people. Something I appreciate coming from\
  \ a small country with more buildings than trees. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do\
  \ like the company of people, but a part of me is also a bit of a hermit and I need\
  \ my \u2018peace and quiet\u2019 time. Anyway, in this part of the world, my little\
  \ person, being blond, stands out. So the name Little Blond was given and taken!\n\
  \nAlentejo Field of flowers\n\nBe Patient, Not Surprised\n\nAfter some going back\
  \ and forth Little Blond is living in the Alentejo for seven months now and so far\
  \ it has been quite a journey. Besides the internal changes she experiences, because\
  \ of leaving behind friends, family and well known surroundings, gradually the typical\
  \ -unwritten- Portuguese ways are noticed and more understood.  One thing Little\
  \ Blond has learned is to be patient and to not be surprised that after several\
  \ renewed appointments the electrician is there on a different day, but fixes the\
  \ problem with the water pump without any further delay and as being a part of his\
  \ service! \u201CQue giro\u201D (how nice) her Portuguese friends would say\u2026\
  \n\nA Smile Speaks a Thousand Words\n\nAnd yes, the language\u2026 ai\u2026 although\
  \ the reading and writing slowly progresses, the words coming out of mouth seems\
  \ sometimes like Russian -which Little Blond does not speak at all-. Especially\
  \ when she encounters her sweet and always friendly older neighbour, the goat cheese\
  \ farmer, on one of her hikes. But maybe that is because of less teeth\u2026  Luckily\
  \ a smile speaks a thousand words. And trying to express herself the Portuguese\
  \ will always try to help and encourage her attempt. With no exceptions so far!"
