Text: "This Peru itinerary brings you to the heart of the Peruvian Andes. The cool\
  \ fresh air will be a welcomed change from the desert or the coast. Once you arrive\
  \ in Cusco, the vibrant Quechua culture is immediately apparent. Cusco is your gate\
  \ way to the Andes and all of the treasures to be found there. The Peruvian Andes\
  \ are home to many interesting well preserved Incan ruins and of course, the famous\
  \ Machu Picchu. This wonder of the world is likely on most tourists\u2019 itinerary.\
  \ During high season, however, you may have to book far in advance, so do your research\
  \ before you travel to Peru, such as which trek you would like to do (if you are\
  \ trekking to Machu Picchu at all).\nBe sure to spend some quality time in the Sacred\
  \ Valley, which are at the foothills of the magnificent Andes mountains. It is home\
  \ to a handful of small towns and weaving villages that are still inhabited by traditional\
  \ families. The best way to explore the Sacred Valley is by bike or motorbike. The\
  \ towns of Pisac, Yucay, Urubamba, Ollantaytambo and Chinchero are all worth a visit.\n\
  Next would be the time to make it to Vinicunca, also called Monta\xF1a de Siete\
  \ Colores. Monta\xF1a de Colores or Rainbow Mountain is a mountain in Peru with\
  \ an altitude of 5,200 meters above sea level.\nIf you have an extra week or two,\
  \ head for Iquitos and the Pervian Amazon it\u2019s amazing place!  Keep in mind\
  \ you must fly into Iquitos, so you will have to backtrack to Lima anyway!"
