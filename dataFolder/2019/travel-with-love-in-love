Text: "The first trip of my life was in Jasper, Alberta in Canada. This place is the\
  \ dictionary meaning of heaven which is amidst snow-capped mountains and glaciers.\
  \ What is surrounded by these rockies is the facade of glacier-fed lakes, dark-green\
  \ pine forests, breath-taking waterfalls and rivers flowing between the Canadian\
  \ Rockies. \n\nIt\u2019s indeed more beautiful than how it sounds, more natural\
  \ like a pearl, extremely thrilling for its diversity of wildlife, best for its\
  \ fun-factor and for its various features like cycling, rock-climbing, summer hiking,\
  \ river rafting, skiing, and the most important of all, especially for Canadians,\
  \ the dog friendly hiking spots. \n\nJasper is not just a tourist spot but also\
  \ a place for explorers, nature lovers, beginnings of a love story and gaining experiences.\
  \ People who come to Jasper are families, couples, friends, adventurers, travel\
  \ experts, wildlife experts and sometimes novices who grasp the best out of their\
  \ Jasper trip.\n\nSomething very similar happened to me as when it happened to be\
  \ my first trip via car, me and my friends decided to rent a cool Dodge Charger\
  \ GT from a Kamloops, BC enterprise. All the way on my journey to Jasper, I would\
  \ try to imagine how it would look like in Jasper but after reaching there I realised\
  \ that may be I was being a lot less imaginative and creative for which I could\
  \ not believe my eyes when I first reached the Mount Columbia. Underneath my eyelids,\
  \ were the dreams to spectate a huge and the highest point in Alberta. \n\nIt being\
  \ the time of fall, I wasn\u2019t just going to stay inside after having travelled\
  \ all the way from Kamloops, BC to Jasper, Alberta. So, we all decided to go do\
  \ some really amazing stuff out there starting with the most talked thing to do\
  \ im Jasper, the Glacier Skywalk. It was an experience like no other, as when you\
  \ are walking on a cliff edge and at that height where you do not want to look down,\
  \ it is ridiculously thrilling.\n\nWell, our journey did not end there as there\
  \ was the SkyTram, next on our itinerary which is an elevation ride up the approx\
  \ 7500 ft mountain and whaf comes next is mind blowing. Once you are at the top\
  \ of the mountain you will see the best view in entire Canadian Rockies where you\
  \ are surrounded by seven different mountains and the Jasper town which is dwelling\
  \ far from your sight. \n\nWhat came next was inexplicable, the Athabasca Falls\
  \ which we could spot from our SkyTram really far from us but trust me, it was literally\
  \ like a cherry on the cake. I must say, it\u2019s one of the most photogenic spot\
  \ of Alberta and make sure that you carry some good camera equipment to capture\
  \ its full beauty. The Athabasca Falls is known to be one of the most powerfull\
  \ waterfall even though it is not counted as the tallest baby. There are trails\
  \ and various platforms from where you can safely view and capture the falls beauty.\
  \ There is also plenty of parking space for cars and RVs as well. Do ensure that\
  \ you don\u2019t have your best shoes\U0001F460 on because it is a slushy area and\
  \ you don\u2019t want to mess up your favourite shoes. \n\nLast but not the least,\
  \ was the late night sky watching when you can just sit in your car until it is\
  \ dark and then open your sunroof and enjoy the great and peaceful view of the stars\
  \ in the galaxy. Jasper is known to have the second largest dark and starry night\
  \ sky which is home to hundreds of galaxies, the milky way and may be if you are\
  \ lucky then on any night sky you may just end up witnessing Northern Lights with\
  \ your bare eyes. Although, there are other places to spot the northern lights but\
  \ having to see them in Jasper is once in a blue moon and who doesn\u2019t like\
  \ that. Or simply just spend the night counting those million stars while you are\
  \ in the arms of your lover. \n\nTo be honest, I fell in love that night and I would\
  \ love to go back there anytime again!"
