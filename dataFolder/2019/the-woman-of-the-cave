Text: "It was dark. Too dark. It made no difference whether my eyes were opened or\
  \ closed. I clasped tightly to a walking stick that I hoped would assuage my fears\
  \ as I walked into the unknown. The night air was cool. It was filled with a chorus\
  \ of crickets and frogs whose chirps and croaks reverberated the surrounding air\
  \ and penetrated my still body. I playfully dared myself to step further into the\
  \ black of night and wondered what the possibility of death would be if I continued\
  \ any further. I laughed at myself for being a New Yorker, a city slicker, a privileged\
  \ millennial in a foreign land, unaccustomed to darkness unadulterated by the glowing\
  \ lights of \"civilization.\" I lost the dare with myself that night. I hadn\u2019\
  t made it more than 100 meters away from the hotel.\nThe next morning the scent\
  \ of pine filled my lungs as the warm glow of a morning sun filled my room. I walked\
  \ over to my window to survey the area of which I was too afraid to explore the\
  \ night before. In the distance were the peaks of Cold Mountain. I was in Tientai,\
  \ China. Professor High, who orchestrated the trip, gathered our class of 4 students\
  \ onto the porch. Our itinerary for the day was to rendezvous with a contact in\
  \ the mountain. Professor High handed me 4 bags of fruit and enigmatically whispered,\
  \ \u201CThey\u2019re for a friend.\u201D\n\tWe trekked two miles over flat land\
  \ to the foot of the mountain at which point before we began to ascend a narrow\
  \ and rocky uphill terrain. Up we went, in single file; I trailed behind the group\
  \ as the 4 bags of fruit (two of which contained well ripened watermelons) exhausted\
  \ my arms. We approached the mouth of a cave. The terrain leveled off.  The entrance\
  \ was as wide as a football stadium, and one could only guess the height of the\
  \ ceiling by echoes of chirping bats. To the far right, about 200 meters in was\
  \ a Buddhist shrine where I thought I would rest my bags of fruit as an offering.\
  \ I was wrong. \n\tA short monk who lived in the cave intercepted our group. His\
  \ small arms flailed in and out the much longer sleeves of his robe as he quarreled\
  \ with our translator. He did not want us in his cave. Fortunately, we had come\
  \ to liaise with his neighbor: the woman of the cave. She quietly peered out from\
  \ the entrance of her hut and gestured that we come forth. My professor led, and\
  \ we followed, disregarding the protests of the cantankerous old monk. My professor\
  \ gave me a wink, which, I correctly assumed, was my cue to present the bags of\
  \ fruit as an offering to the woman of the cave: the keeper of the shrine.\n\tHer\
  \ sun-kissed skin was marked by facial lines that one receives after a lifetime\
  \ of laughter. She was mute. But spoke in the language of kindness: evinced by the\
  \ mindfulness in how she occupied and moved her body through space; there was a\
  \ gentleness in her step, as if she had named every pebble on which she stepped.\
  \ \nI brought her the 4 bags of fruit. She gestured that I give 3 bags to the monk\
  \ who was steaming from his earlier quarrel. She took the remaining bag and proceeded\
  \ to slice and serve its contents to our class. Professor High instructed us to\
  \ sit in a circle (the circle symbolizing equality amongst all its constituents).\
  \ The woman of the cave, moving as gracefully as old age and rocky terrain could\
  \ allow, appeared before me. A slice of watermelon, the juice dripping down the\
  \ back of her hand, she presented to me. I reached out. Our hands touched. Our eyes\
  \ met. A fraction of a second was expanded into eternity, and in that time-space,\
  \ the burden of all my identities (American, Male, Veteran, Black, Foreigner, English\
  \ Language Speaker) vanished. \n\nI had experienced for the first time in my life\
  \ what it is like to interact with someone who saw through the veil of identity\
  \ and into the fundamental core of who I am: a living being."
