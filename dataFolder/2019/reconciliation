Text: "No one can really savor their freedom until they\u2019ve overcome fear. I learned\
  \ this the day we met Luca. \n\nAs we approached the open caf\xE9 right off the\
  \ Ponte Vecchio bridge, we plopped down at a table outside to rest. \u201CDue caff\xE8\
  \u201D Michele called out, holding up two fingers with a smile. From our seats,\
  \ Florence was painted before us. Even as the setting sun slipped into the late\
  \ evening, the St. Trinity Bridge stood on guard in the distance across the Arno\
  \ River, bordered by dotted lights along the roads. Fading yellows and greens colored\
  \ the buildings between the two historic bridges.\n\nThe Ponte Vecchio was alive\
  \ around us. Sounds of violins and gentle drum beats cut through the air as Florentines\
  \ outside the caf\xE9 tangoed hand-in-hand along the bridge\u2019s cobblestone road.\
  \ \n\n\u201CEveryone is happy.\u201D I recall the first three words from Luca, a\
  \ white-haired man sitting at the small table next to ours. He quietly noticed us\
  \ watching the dancing outside. We smiled back at him in agreement.\n\nMichele,\
  \ native Italian and my new friend from our hostel in Florence, began to make conversation\
  \ with the man in fluent Italian. I watched in silence as Luca clasped his hands\
  \ as he spoke to Michele. Worn and shaking slightly with age. Gripped tight, then\
  \ released. Gripped. Released.\n\nLuca stopped talking to sip his espresso and Michele\
  \ turned to tell me Luca was a young boy when the German soldiers occupied Florence\
  \ during World War 2. His family, like many ripped from their homes nearby, had\
  \ been forced to evacuate and stay at the Palazzo Pitti \u2013 a large fortress\
  \ close by. Hearing Michele recap his story in English to me, Luca took over.\n\n\
  \u201CEvery day, we waited to die. Fear of the Nazis lived in us. I was young but\
  \ even I knew of threats to bomb the bridges \u2013 these ancient bridges that have\
  \ lived centuries. Because of these invaders in our home.\u201D Luca\u2019s eyes\
  \ closed briefly. \u201CMany of us were in the Pitti when they started going down.\
  \ Blasts were so loud that we heard them inside the fort. It felt like the earth\
  \ below us was shaking and crashing apart.\u201D \n\nLuca looked at me before his\
  \ eyes shifted back to the people on the bridge. Locals and tourists mingled as\
  \ laughter and excited chatter hung in the air. Contentment rested across his sunken\
  \ features.\n\n\u201CPonte Vecchio is the only bridge that remained without harm\
  \ from the war.\u201D Luca smiled at us with a nod as he eased out of his chair.\
  \ The violin segued into shorter bursts of elated sound across the Ponte Vecchio.\
  \ The musicians smiled at the loose Euros being tossed into their open cases. Children\
  \ sat on the curb fisting tiny cups of gelato, licking their tiny spoons clean.\
  \ \n\nMoonlight sparkled off the Arno River. Once filled with rubble, now radiating\
  \ amorous community above."
