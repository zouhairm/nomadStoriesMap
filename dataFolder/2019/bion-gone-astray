Text: "Bion Gone Astray\n\n\"You shall always be hungry for me\". She whispered in\
  \ his ears.\nThe heat of her breath locked him up in her scent and blocked the procession\
  \ of her words in his mind. In this instant, although he was facing huge shelves\
  \ of manifold papyrus scrolls that open the route to the whole universe with its\
  \ anatomy, astronomy, philosophy and more, her crawling, most tender of all touches\
  \ upon his shoulders captivated him in a universe that is exclusively hers.\nShe\
  \ pushed the scroll he intended to pull out back in and pressed herself passionately\
  \ against his back. Irresistibly, Bion dropped from his mind whatever he planned\
  \ to do, turned around, looked hungrily in her eyes knowing that nothing would suffice\
  \ his longing to their moments together. Holding hands, they flew across the labyrinths\
  \ of the huge shelves, leaving behind beams of burning light reflecting in the vaults.\n\
  Bion was one of the assigned scribes who spend their days in the laborious work\
  \ of copying papyrus scrolls to feed the huge \"Bibliothekai\" in the Musaeum of\
  \ Alexandria, yet he never thought of what he was doing as great. He understood\
  \ the venomous intentions of collecting and accumulating such records \u2013 vain\
  \ pride. Knowledge was so transcendental a thing to be ridiculed into a mere tool\
  \ of showing off the wealth of a dynasty; however, he did not care much.\nCompelled\
  \ to be one of the scribes to earn a living, he found solace in her. She, who surpassed\
  \ in her charm the nine Muses for whom the Bibliothekai was said to be built. Bion\
  \ first met her in one of the study halls. Her shrewd eyes and a glowing face got\
  \ him hooked up in an entangled quest for her. So prime to call them love, so intense\
  \ to call them attraction, Bion\u2019s feelings compelled him to stalk her endless\
  \ wanderings.\nTheir meetings were intense; they fed their body and soul. A refuge\
  \ their love was for both of them.\nOne warm night, Bion devised a plan to free\
  \ her from her royal trap. His wherefores were simple: an obsessed king's sister\
  \ that demanded no one around but his lady was a plague from which the whole city\
  \ should be purged. \nAs for her, being caught and cuffed in a cage of pseudo-shimmer\
  \ had always weighed over her heart, the Bibliothekai had always resembled for her\
  \ a huge prison in which she served only the princess in the morning, and was her\
  \ play tool at night. \n\"I will set you free and strong like this ferocious eagle\"\
  , Bion pointed his finger up to the cloudless, ebony sky and printed a kiss on her\
  \ eyelid, oozing the sense of security through her veins. \nThe day came and the\
  \ deliverance waved very close. Bion crept into the Musaeum and rushed as a shadow\
  \ into the Bibliothekai. Aware of every corner and knowing every inch by heart,\
  \ he clutched a lantern, lit it and lit the first papyrus. The flames started to\
  \ move hypnotically like an exotic dancer that slowly swayed and gradually felt\
  \ the heat that fed her body translating it into vigorous moves. The flames ate\
  \ up whatever blocked the way to liberate themselves into absolute void.\nFlames\
  \ roamed the streets of the city, not forgetting their glorious mission, passing\
  \ by the princess's recluse on the top floor of the Bibliothekai. But flames are\
  \ not always just, they swallowed surrounding houses and even the zoo that belonged\
  \ to the Musaeum.\nBion's joyous steps carried him on wind out of the Bibliothekai\
  \ and among the tumultuous riot of hurling people and animals. The land shook below\
  \ his feet and the dust built a suspended colony in the air out of which stopped\
  \ him the eagle that he once pointed out onto. His wild eyes faced Bion's wild self\
  \ and his sagacity counterfeited his foolishness. The eagle flew in two full circles\
  \ around Bion and rested on his shoulder, firmly clasping his flesh with his claws.\
  \ Bion's grimace of pain soon turned into total surrender to the eagle that flew\
  \ up towards the hill where he was supposed to meet her and dropped him.\nBion waited.\n\
  She never arrived."
