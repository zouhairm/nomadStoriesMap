Text: "As I arrive, the first things I hear are high-pitched screams. Welling up eyes\
  \ land on me the instant I walk through the door, with my own alarm mirroring that\
  \ of the terrified toddler. A couple of seconds and I finally learn the word that\
  \ rings out with the cries \u2013 Mzungu; white person, and apparently the first\
  \ European that little Glory has ever seen. Before this moment, I was simply the\
  \ stuff of stories, said to her in the safe cradle of her family\u2019s arms. But\
  \ now I am the scary thing that has clambered out of the story books and into her\
  \ reality.\n \nIntroductions, unpacking, dinner and the day is done; but it isn\u2019\
  t until the moon grins late into the night that I go to sleep. Wrapping myself up\
  \ in a thin sheet of tribal fabric, I close my eyes before drifting gently into\
  \ dreams of tomorrow\u2019s possibilities.\n \nIt is morning and the light splinters\
  \ through the palm trees casting lines on the dusty ground. A hop, jump and stumble,\
  \ and Glory playfully navigates her bare feet through the shadows and roaming insects,\
  \ whilst squeals of laughter, chorused by her mother\u2019s warnings, carry high\
  \ over the stirring world. \u2018Simama!\u2019 It takes a moment to realise that\
  \ the command is for me. Using the points of chubby fingers as cues, I stand and\
  \ gleefully smile at Glory\u2019s nod of approval. Another word in Swahili and I\
  \ assume my position as an obstacle in her new-found game.\n \nIt is the evening\
  \ and the sun wishes the sky goodbye with brilliant streaks of crimson. As the hum\
  \ of dusk emerges, so do the prayers from surrounding homes. To the left of me,\
  \ I can hear the flowing words of Islam, while to the right, devotions to God are\
  \ breathed through cupped hands. Glory listens to it all as if it is the most natural\
  \ sound in the world. A shared space of different beliefs, harmonising peacefully\
  \ into a song of diversity that doesn\u2019t end until the curtain of night falls.\
  \ Once quiet, with only the background noise of nature, Glory rolls a ball along\
  \ the floor towards me - I can\u2019t help but feel like it is a peace offering.\
  \ I pick it up before returning it back to her. We find common ground in the space\
  \ between a moving toy.\n \nIt is a week later and the soft pad of feet entering\
  \ from the kitchen heralds a playful face and a full tummy. As stubborn fists try\
  \ to rub the sleep from her eyes, a toothy grin says \u2018now is the time for games\u2019\
  . A couple of steps and Glory\u2019s little hand presses against my palm, a sticky\
  \ residue of tonight\u2019s maize or what is more locally known as \u2018Ugale\u2019\
  , transfers onto my skin. A giggle erupts at my disgruntled face, which pulls the\
  \ edges of my mouth into a laughing smile. Like the spitting into hands before shaking\
  \ on a deal, this was our version; the seal of a lasting friendship."
