Text: "A hand emerged from the crowd and shoved a battered ten-rupee note into my\
  \ mouth. I bit down on the note so it wouldn\u2019t fall out, and continued to dance\
  \ as the paper slowly turned to mush. \n\nThe elderly woman next to me wore a vibrant\
  \ blue saree, layers upon layers of chiffon dotted with jewels that twinkled in\
  \ the street light. Her nose shimmered with a golden ruby stud. We mirrored each\
  \ other\u2019s dance moves despite the age difference, and together we celebrated\
  \ the first night of a young couple\u2019s wedding in the streets of Bundi. We exchanged\
  \ no words but so many smiles, it felt like enough to illuminate all of India.\n\
  \nUmbrellas embellished with strings of pixie lights swayed in the air from a metal\
  \ pole. The groom wore a gray suit and sat on a majestic white horse decorated with\
  \ red and yellow ornaments, surrounded by locals, singing and dancing in the crowded\
  \ streets.\n \nMusic blasted from an overused speaker on a pickup truck. Happy children\
  \ sat at the edge of the truck bed, little legs swinging to and fro, immune to the\
  \ volume of noise that was only inches from their ears. High above in the sky, colorful\
  \ fireworks exploded in bursts, commemorating the first night of the celebration\
  \ of the bride and the groom.\n\nLittle did I know, this was only the start to an\
  \ incredible three day wedding celebration I had been invited to by the family of\
  \ my homestay. \n\nThe next day, after agreeing to let one of the family members\
  \ dress me and do my makeup, I wandered around the wedding with hot pink eyeshadow,\
  \ eyebrows darkened so much that they resembled caterpillars, a fake nose stud,\
  \ and sparkling five dollar pink ballet flats I was coerced into purchasing, since\
  \ my deteriorating dollar flip-flops from Goa didn\u2019t seem to do the trick.\
  \ \n \nLater on in the evening, young and old women and everyone in between pulled\
  \ and twisted my wrists, shouting, \u201Cselfie, selfie!\u201D, trying to see who\
  \ would win my attention. I attributed their intense interest to my wildly painted\
  \ face, which had me looking like a Bollywood actress. Their eyes shone with love\
  \ and fascination, big brown eyes that could drown you with their gaze, innocent\
  \ brown eyes that seemed to curiously ask, \u2018how did this foreigner get here?\u2019\
  \n\nOn the third day of the wedding, I wore a gorgeous orange saree, borrowed from\
  \ the wife at the homestay. The garment felt awkward as I struggled to walk, but\
  \ despite this, I felt so welcomed, so immersed into their culture, that all I could\
  \ do by the third night was laugh, dance, and sing.\n\nThe evening I left, I struggled\
  \ to say goodbye to the wonderful family that brought me into their world and made\
  \ me feel at home, as if I were a part of the family. \n\n\u201CEveryone at the\
  \ wedding kept asking about you,\u201D the husband said. \u201CThey want you to\
  \ come into their homes so they can feed you and share a chai with you.\u201D\n\n\
  His circular face and pointed chin resembled a heart. His feather eyebrows formed\
  \ semi-circles above his round, golden eyes. His hands were full of calluses and\
  \ wrinkles; as if layers upon layers of stories were waiting to be revealed, their\
  \ secrets kept beneath the surface.\n\n\u201CYou know, many people come to our homestay,\
  \ but only a few stay with us in our heart,\u201D he said. \u201CYou are one of\
  \ them. You have such a jolly nature and we think of you as family.\u201D\n \nI\
  \ drew in a sharp breath and took his hand, the only gesture I could manage. \n\n\
  \u201CPlease come back again soon,\u201D he said. \u201CThis place is your home,\
  \ you are our family.\u201D\n\nI stood there looking at this man, at his family,\
  \ at all of their pure and honest smiles. They showed me so much unconditional love\
  \ in a short amount of time, that an overwhelming sense of joy filled me, and I\
  \ thought\u2026 this moment, this feeling, is why I travel."
