Text: "The sun had just risen, we\u2019re all seating on a night point of one of the\
  \ countless dunes in that orange mass. The first rays touched them making it even\
  \ more beautiful, all the peoples trying to get the best angle, the best compositions,\
  \ the best number of likes... I decided to sit next to the old man who guided us\
  \ along with the camels. wrinkles of old age covered his face, we began to talk\
  \ and I asked him to tell me some history about his life and family.\n\nHe told\
  \ me so many stories, but he really get my attention in the part where he talked\
  \ about the simplicity of the life, and how happy he and his family was. \n\nThe\
  \ sun was already high, so he asked me why I was not taking pictures like the others\
  \ instead of seating there talking to an old man. I said that what mattered most\
  \ to me was to connect with local people when I\u2019m traveling, to know more about\
  \ them, theirs culture, that motivates me. So, finally I asked him to take a picture\
  \ with me to remember that moment unique for me, thanked him for that and was about\
  \ to getting up to leave and he asked me to wait. \nHe took something from inside\
  \ of his bag, and asked to me to open my hand. When I open he putts inside a beautiful\
  \ necklace. I was surprised, he said \u201CThis is a gift for you, I can see you\
  \ beautiful heart when we talked, you\u2019re different, keep being like this, this\
  \ is special cause are made for our people, the Berber peoples do praying while\
  \ we build this necklaces, to make sure who will use it, it always be protected.\n\
  \nWow, that made my day, my trip, was feeling so blessed that I could return home\
  \ with my heart and faith renewed! To know the Merzouga desert was one of the most\
  \ interesting experiences in my life, certainly will keep this history in my heart\
  \ for ever! \u2665\uFE0F"
