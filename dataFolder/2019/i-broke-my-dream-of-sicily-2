Text: "The trip to Sicilia does not always have a romantic start.\n\nI felt kind of\
  \ lost when I got off from the bus. After a bus trip of 8 hours from Milano, I arrived\
  \ Messina, alone ( with my backpack), with the hunger in my stomach. Where are the\
  \ orange trees? The outgoing people who always dance no matter there is a festival\
  \ or not? The famous God Father? I saw nothing, it was 3'o clock in the afternoon,\
  \ only an empty station square under the strong sunshine of Mediterranean welcomed\
  \ me.   \n\nSicily is such a dreamland. We saw it from all these famous movies,\
  \ heard it from thousands of travelers and backpackers, discovered it from the most\
  \ amazing photos of Italy, but I didn't realize what kind of adventure I was getting\
  \ into. It was not the Sicily they told me. I started to get to know it by visiting\
  \ the vintage streets, colorful homes and smells of different food. \n   \nIn Siracusa\
  \ I had dinner with some interesting friends of the hostel, while sharing about\
  \ the life experience from different backgrounds and nationalities, we surprised\
  \ that the reason we came to Sicilia was almost the same: to discover the Sicily\
  \ we heard from other people. And of course, we never found the one we dreamed of.\
  \ It\u2019s rural, traditional, totally a real world, not a fairytale. \nI had to\
  \ be proud of myself since I changed my mind into accepting everything. A leap into\
  \ the unknown Sicily, my Sicily. Sounds attractive and dangerous, therefore, I missed\
  \ my last train in the countryside of Noto with the spirit of \u2018go wild, wander\
  \ and explore\u2019. \n\nThe fame of baroque architecture brought me to Noto, also\
  \ there were many nice osterie ( usually family-run small restaurants) and pastry\
  \ shops. I bet if you are crazy about sweets, it\u2019s the moment to meet the paradise.\
  \ After a classic visit, I decided to take a mini train (it has only three coaches)\
  \ and have a look of the neighborhood. However, I was over optimistic about the\
  \ train schedule until one local guy told me to 'run back to the station, quickly!\
  \ too late!'. Fortunately, one train passed but unfortunately, it shouldn\u2019\
  t stop in this station! I swore I waved maximumly my poor arms and roared to stop\
  \ the train: it could be the last train I would meet tonight!    \nI never thought\
  \ the trip could be that tough. Three days before, when I spent the whole afternoon\
  \ in the roman ruins of Taormina to finish my painting, I thought Sicily was just\
  \ a place full of ancient architectures and quiet environments that could offer\
  \ me so many inspirations. I started to miss the warm host family (and their huge\
  \ balcony) of Messina, miss the fresh seafood of Palermo, miss the crowded market\
  \ of Catania. We always look back during the trip, and imagine how it can be different\
  \ if we choose another way. \n\nBut then I remembered the hurt of falling down (I\
  \ blame the shoes instead of my balance skill) on the volcano Etna. Oh, the awkward\
  \ moment made me laugh, I touched the ground of this island, we had no more distance.\
  \ Sicily was not a legend, the facilities were not perfect, and I met some incredible\
  \ hard time here, but I loved it.\nThe train was marching with really slow speed,\
  \ I hide in the corner and fell in sleep in the music of rain. Not sure it was in\
  \ the dream or real world, somebody was talking to the driver, about the dinner\
  \ and few family dramas. Suddenly everything seems much more familiar, people and\
  \ life details made me feel homesick, but my loneliness and stress of lost disappeared\
  \ gradually.\n\nA leap into Sicily is dangerous, too beautiful to be true, too complicated\
  \ to be perfect, and too different to keep my original dream of it. It was totally\
  \ a new world for me before I entered, and it\u2019s still an unknown mystery for\
  \ me after I spent two weeks with her. But I do feel her: from every details of\
  \ my daily life, from my enthusiasm for culture heritages, unique cuisine and charming\
  \ people, but not from the imagination anymore."
