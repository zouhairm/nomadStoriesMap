Text: ",,Hallo! Ich hei\xDFe Garima!\u2019\u2019 \nI had just put on my best caught-in-a-weird-and-slightly-uncomfortable-social-situation\
  \ smile and told the motley bunch of people standing in the B2.1 classroom  of the\
  \ Goethe Institut in Germany that my name was Garima.\nThe year was 2017. The season,\
  \ fall. Beneath the second storey window of my new classroom, the maple was bathed\
  \ in a splash of red, gold and green. \nI had received a scholarship to continue\
  \ learning my favourite language in the world, German, while interning at a big\
  \ family-owned enterprise located on the Prinzregentenstrasse in South-East Munich,\
  \ in the city that had claimed my heart the first time I set foot in it as a 16\
  \ year old in 2011 and which still held me in its unbreakable spell. \nI would learn\
  \ later that the motley bunch came from all parts of the world. From Russia and\
  \ Venezuela. From France and England. From Spain and South Korea. \nI would learn\
  \ later that the first person to smile back at me, came however, from Brazil. His\
  \ eyes were a sparkling black, staring right into my deep brown. His broad forehead\
  \ was framed with a thick mop of curly, unkempt hair and lined with what I remember\
  \ assessing at that time as THE perfect beard.\n\u201CSo, Garima! Where are you\
  \ from?\u201D he asked me in seemingly perfect German and I remember him grinning\
  \ even more broadly on hearing that I was an Indian. \nI also remember mentally\
  \ marking that moment as one when I realized I had developed my first crush in one\
  \ of Europe\u2019s prettiest, cleanest, most cultured and historically significant\
  \ cities. \nAs the couple of weeks left for the B2.1 batch started passed by, my\
  \ liking intensified. Phil, let\u2019s call him that, was a gem of a person. \n\
  He was cheerful, outgoing, always ready to help, the first to try a particularly\
  \ hard sentence structure and vocalize the results, the last to leave after the\
  \ lessons. He was also the first to befriend me and make me feel a little more at\
  \ home by partnering with me during activities and striking conversations with the\
  \ shy introvert that I was.  \nHe would tell me during those chats about cycling\
  \ to a school, as a child, 15 kilometers away in his  home town of Porto Alegre\
  \ and we would compare how many languages we were both fluent in.  My tally ran\
  \ out at 4, his was 7 and counting. \nWe would go, with my group of friends and\
  \ his by extension, on a day trip to Ammersee, where he\u2019d jump into the freezing\
  \ cold waters of the sixth largest lake in Germany while mocking my inability to\
  \ swim.\nI would learn through Google about his raging popularity as a street artist\
  \ back home and discover, with my own eyes and ears, his raw talent in singing and\
  \ acting. I would get a chance to listen to him play the accordion after class on\
  \ the cobblestone streets spanning the distance between Karlsplatz and Marienplatz,\
  \ drawing not just attention but also applause, cheer and enough money for him to\
  \ finance a small European trip. His rendition of Queen\u2019s \u2018I want to break\
  \ free\u2019 is on my phone and it still makes me smile, after one and a half years,\
  \ during which we haven\u2019t spoken much. \nOn his last day in Munich, he told\
  \ me that the 2 minutes of conversation we had on my first and his 14th day of class\
  \ (I had joined late) were  in intimidatingly perfect German. For my diffident German\
  \ speaking self, it was a huge motivator. He was the first one in the country who\
  \ made me realize that my efforts counted more than my fears. \nAnd though we aren\u2019\
  t friends, as I\u2019d have liked us to be, I believe we meet people exactly when\
  \ we are meant to, for reasons we come to know of only in hindsight. In my story,\
  \ the reason was perhaps him teaching me to be a little more forgiving towards myself,\
  \ to live a little more in the present and also, to not keep falling for all the\
  \ cute strangers I met while travelling. You see, he told me before leaving that\
  \ he had a boyfriend!"
