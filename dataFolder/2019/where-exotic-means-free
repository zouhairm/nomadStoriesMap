Text: "Coming from a rather traditional and conservative background, often times stereotypes\
  \ and judgements prevent oneself from exploring new and eccentric territories. In\
  \ my case, these limitations don\u2019t exactly apply. Submerging myself into foreign\
  \ cultures, exploring how people go about their lives in different corners of the\
  \ world excites me, it reminds me that there is life beyond confined walls of society.\
  \  In Mexico, my natal country, we are seen as exotic, warm and eccentric individuals;\
  \ I can confirm that in fact these stereotypes are true, but we\u2019re also followed\
  \ by the inseparable standard of staying within our established comfort zone, something\
  \ that I\u2019ve come to realize is a limitation I\u2019m not willing to follow.\n\
  \nRecently I had the opportunity to take my first step towards breaking apart from\
  \ this norm, I was able to travel to Europe for the first time, taking a month-long\
  \ trip to different countries within the continent. Although plenty of stories and\
  \ memories were made during this period, the one city that amazed me the most was\
  \ Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. Amsterdam has a rather controversial reputation,\
  \ some saying that it\u2019s a party city due to the freedom that it provides to\
  \ the locals and tourists. People expect an endless offering of partying, drugs,\
  \ sex, perdition. What they don\u2019t cherish is the quintessential factor that\
  \ this city provides: art. This broad term can be applied to everything Amsterdam\
  \ offers, from hidden alleys were the locals go for a casual cup of coffee, to the\
  \ iridescent reflections of the city lights on the canals at sunset, to the classical\
  \ architecture built into the identity of the urban landscape, this city is filled\
  \ with a historical, picturesque richness that touches every adventurer\u2019s desire\
  \ to immerse themselves in the beauty of new surroundings. \n\nI won\u2019t lie,\
  \ it certainly meets the expectation of what the city is expected to be: excess.\
  \ Although this is true, I found myself in awe while walking around Museum Square,\
  \ the joy that I felt when admiring original oil paintings and artifacts in the\
  \ Van Gogh Museum, recognizing and commemorating the tragedy of the Holocaust while\
  \ imagining what life must have been like in that tiny apartment in the Anne Frank\
  \ Museum, the list is endless, an excess in cultural offering.\n\nThe term of \u201C\
  exotic\u201D doesn\u2019t need to be confined to sunny beaches and a sparkling ocean.\
  \ Exotic means foreign, exotic means different, exotic means diversity, exotic means\
  \ free. And that\u2019s what Amsterdam is, free. There\u2019s freedom in social\
  \ standards, locals don\u2019t live within an established canon, they take pride\
  \ in expressing their deepest desires and fervors in the way they speak, dress,\
  \ act, love; their overall unapologetic way of everyday life. \n\nMajoring in Communications\
  \ definitely allows you to have an interest in people, therefore I\u2019m passionate\
  \ about observing how even the most mundane routines of a foreign individual can\
  \ represent something transformative, opening one\u2019s eyes into truly admiring\
  \ how this community knows it\u2019s eccentric, people recognize who they are, and\
  \ they embrace it with such pride that inspires me to want to see the world through\
  \ their eyes.\n\nPersonally, traveling is not only about spending a relaxing vacation\
  \ in a tranquil and known place, it\u2019s about willing to part from previous judgement\
  \ and prove typecast conventions wrong. Amsterdam was that perfect place, where\
  \ the locals I met invited me to join them for an outing when learning I was just\
  \ passing by, where they were genuinely enthusiastic about sharing their knowledge\
  \ and culture, where an artist sparked a conversation with me about how Van Gogh\
  \ captured the essence of the era in \u201CThe Potato Eaters\u201D. It is a city\
  \ of colors, of light, of the offbeat and quirky, of the passionate at heart."
