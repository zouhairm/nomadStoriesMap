Text: "If I confess, cities have solely excited me for being an islander all my life,\
  \ it would be an understatement. When the dream to stroll the streets of Delhi turned\
  \ a reality, I was already there treading towards the infamous GB Road. Pimps lurked\
  \ like shadows on the sun baked streets branched into numerous narrowed stairways.\
  \ Much more claustrophobic than words can ever make it sound, the stairs led towards\
  \ tapering hallway. Platforms homed women, old, eccentric or amputated, who begged\
  \ the customers in their flight. Startling the eyes after the stony passage, white\
  \ lights lit up the wider living rooms. Sunaina met us in the second brothel we\
  \ entered. Truth be confessed I still don\u2019t know if I was told a name which\
  \ wasn\u2019t fictional, but I knew it didn\u2019t matter.\nShe was clad in a mustard\
  \ blouse that stole kisses with her red skirt whenever she leaned to leer at the\
  \ passerby. Her lips were painted red, occasionally caressed by the lose strands\
  \ falling from her high bun. Introducing myself, I began a conversation I was to\
  \ recall every time I heard someone mention Delhi. Widowed and mother of two, she\
  \ told me how her trade made her leave Rajasthan. Sold by her in-laws, she entered\
  \ Kotah 45 pregnant with life and determination to live she entered the only place\
  \ that took her in. Not knowing the language of trade, the very reason why she encouraged\
  \ her daughter to learn the same, made her trade in flesh. \nShalu was the first\
  \ one willing to speak among the first brothels we visited. Commanding respect,\
  \ not just in age but presence, she volunteered to be interviewed inviting us inside.\
  \ Stepping inside, my own reflection on the mirrored walls greeted me. Reclined\
  \ on wooden benches or striding across doors, draped in night gowns and skirts,\
  \ their brightly hued fabric contrasted against the tilled whiteness they strolled\
  \ on. Outside the hubble-bubble of the street reflected the traffic of any other\
  \ street in the city. The infamous G.B Road which housed the brothels had its ground\
  \ floor solely for the hardware shops. Hardened by what they sold, most business\
  \ men crowned inside their glass chambers, believed the living quarters upstairs\
  \ wasn\u2019t worth their time and denied any interaction. \nMoist palms cradling\
  \ my phone and steps getting heavier with every stony descend, the will to converse\
  \ got fainter with every winding day. Engrossed in her story, the hand that slid\
  \ along my waist made me leap away in fear I hadn\u2019t known before. An enraged\
  \ Shalu pushed the man away while her other arm met mine in comforting pats. A weak\
  \ smile confessed if unaccompanied I might be mistaken as one among them. But I\
  \ knew I didn\u2019t have the courage to be what the street had labeled me, a prostitute.\
  \ Guilt was the answer, why I never mailed my feature story, why I stop myself from\
  \ musing on the city anymore, why I still want to go back.\nIn my mind I have strolled\
  \ back, meeting the clinking before the friendly face busy stirring lemonade. Walking\
  \ past not judged, but the Pan shop owner glancing only for a quick cordial greeting\
  \ between his servings. Climbing past the polished passage, cleansed off, of the\
  \ tobacco stains and abusive customers, meeting chattering women clad in night gowns\
  \ and skirt, sounding just like the halls of the girls hostel. Guilt free, retracing\
  \ my steps, unseeing the darkness already seen. Lighter in my ambles, with the weight\
  \ of using them just like the customers, lifted, G B Road was memorable but differently.\
  \ Wall with a graffiti, a woman\u2019s face with a fierce gaze and free-floating\
  \ hair would have the unforgettable G.B Road, lost in memory."
