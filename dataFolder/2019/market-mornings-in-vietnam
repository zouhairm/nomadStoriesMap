Text: "Vietnam caught me by surprise.\n\u201CBahn mi, Bahn mi, now\u201D the nasal\
  \ cry of the bread seller peddling her bicycle drifts up to the third floor window\
  \ and reminds me that it\u2019s 6 am. I stumble out of bed and rouse Kerry, whispering,\
  \ \u201Cwake up, we need to go get groceries\u201D.\nThe heat is stifling even this\
  \ early and I throw on a pair of shorts and a thin t-shirt, still damp from the\
  \ wash 3 days ago, because yes, it\u2019s mouldy march, with not 10, not 20 but\
  \ a hundred present humidity. Someone left a sheet a paper on the floor in the kitchen\
  \ last night and as I a pick it up, it\u2019s absorbed so much moisture that it\
  \ doubles over.\nKerry and I manoeuvre one of the motorbikes off the foot wide ramp\
  \ out of the front door and onto the sidewalk and we set off along Nhat Chieu road\
  \ towards the market. This early there is still some mist hanging over the water\
  \ of Hoan Kiem Lake and I savour the moment of silence before the storm.\nAllan\
  \ Henri showed us the market for this first time, he\u2019s been here for years,\
  \ and his Vietnamese is excellent. We now just stick to what he taught us. First\
  \ stop is the chicken lady. She sits on the ground at the exit of the parking lot,\
  \ a plot of red dirt with lots of puddles. Working on a round wooden chopping boarding\
  \ she chops whole chickens in precise strokes, so quickly I can\u2019t really keep\
  \ up. She greets us with a broad smile as I crouch down next to her. I know she\u2019\
  s happy to get rid of her unwanted chicken breasts. A neck, leg or anything containing\
  \ a bone would\u2019ve cost us three times as much. Strange. \u201CNam,Sau, Bay,\
  \ Kilo?\u201D She offers us 5, 6 or 7 kilos, wiping the hair from her face under\
  \ her cone straw hat. Kerry laughs, \u201CGhom, Ghom,Ba kilos\u201D, no, no only\
  \ 3 kilos. \u201CSin Cam on\u201D (thank you) she nods, beaming and gestures with\
  \ her bloody chicken knife towards the vegetable ladies.\nThe rest of the market\
  \ is under a makeshift, roof about 7 meters down the street. As we enter the hive\
  \ of the market we are met by a flurry of colour and activity and sounds and smells,\
  \ and high pitched hawkers haggling down prices and big metal bowls clanging, sizzling\
  \ somewhere, smoke, a chicken, a pig, a jellyfish and some snails.\u201DBao noa\
  \ thien?\u201C, \u201CHow much? How much do you want to pay?\u201D\nBarely escaping\
  \ with our lives (slightly dramatic I know) Kerry and I find our way to the vegetables\
  \ stalls. Dusty wooden benches are weighed down by tattered plastic flour bags filled\
  \ with potatoes, carrots, onions, bok choi, beans, tomatoes and c\u1EA3i c\u1EE7\
  \ (a strange green alien looking fruit, which to this day I don\u2019t know how\
  \ to cook). Heads of Lettuce, often accompanied by some other critters are laid\
  \ on sheets of plastic or in woven baskets. Rambutan, leechies, and tiny green \u201C\
  Chinese apples\u201D are displayed next to these. Little grey plastic bags are loaded\
  \ and weighed on old silver kitchen scales. We leave at the other entry of the market,\
  \ ducking under a line of dried shrivelled fish. Politely trying to refuse the other\
  \ array of produce offered to us.\nIt is now about 7.15 am. The chicken lady hands\
  \ us a soggy plastic bag. We pop the seat of the motorbike wiggling and wedging\
  \ a watermelon into the very small space. Bags are hung on my handle bars, some\
  \ chicken juice dripping on my knees. Kerry holds the potatoes, pineapples, rice\
  \ and tomatoes and we narrowly escape hitting the mango vendor as we swerve for\
  \ a stray dog who narrowly escaped getting hit by a car.\nBack at the house on Nhat\
  \ chieu street, someone just turned on the kettle. The single bread seller and the\
  \ quite mist now long gone."
