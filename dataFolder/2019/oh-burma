Text: "Leaving Mandalay\u2019s airport, my sister, Adi, and I spotted a sky-blue billboard\
  \ mandating \u201CWARMLY WELCOME & TAKE CARE OF TOURISTS!\u201D in both English\
  \ and Burmese, with images of five Western backpackers above three tourism hotline\
  \ numbers.  A sign that was presumably supposed to make us feel safe, instead made\
  \ us feel uneasy with our \u201Cspecial guest\u201D status.  The sign seemed ominous,\
  \ as though trying to prove something.  I tried to put it out of mind.  It was 2013,\
  \ and Myanmar had just opened up its borders to tourism.  \n\nThat evening, while\
  \ taking photos of Sutaungpyei Pagoda\u2019s panoramic views and bejeweled Buddhas,\
  \ a group of students preparing for the state-mandated tourism exam approached us.\
  \  One woman, Tamu, and two men, Kyaw and Nasu, were in their twenties like us;\
  \ and one man, Than Soe, with fine lines around his eyes, was closer to 40.  Unlike\
  \ the younger students, he wore the traditional Myanma sarong that both men and\
  \ women commonly used.  When we said we came from the United States, Kyaw, the skinnier\
  \ of the young men, exclaimed, \u201CAmerica? I smell democracy!\u201D  The students\
  \ asked for help pronouncing the \u201Csp\u201D sound in English, and lamented how\
  \ the words \u201Csprite\u201D and \u201Csurprise\u201D were particularly difficult\
  \ to say and differentiate.  Had we eaten yet?  Would we like to go to their house\
  \ for dinner?  Adi and I, surprised by their hospitable offer, politely declined.\
  \  Could they then, if we obliged, please practice their tour guiding and English\
  \ skills on my sister and me, and be our guides tomorrow around Mandalay?  When\
  \ we asked how much they would charge, they said that, of course, it would be free.\n\
  \nWe were skeptical.  Free?  Bucking cautious judgement, we agreed to meet at our\
  \ hotel at 8:00am. \n\nThe next morning sitting in our hotel\u2019s crowded lobby,\
  \ Adi and I brainstormed back-up plans in case the students did not come.  We debated\
  \ how we would try and compensate the students if they did come.  We went through\
  \ different scenarios of what could happen if they weren\u2019t actually so altruistic.\
  \  \n\n\u201CBut Carolyn,\u201D Adi said, \u201Cthat sign.\u201D  I agreed with\
  \ a tinge of reluctance, unsettled that the sign held the power to sway our vigilance.\n\
  \nJust then, Kyaw walked in sporting sharp dress slacks.  He had on, under his plaid\
  \ collared shirt, a black T-shirt that said \u201COBURMA\u201D in yellow, red, and\
  \ green writing, a nod to Barack Obama\u2019s first visit to the country seven months\
  \ earlier.  We grabbed our day bags, and, inspirited by the airport\u2019s sign,\
  \ set off on motorbikes.  \n\nAt the 12-foot-tall Mingun Bell, our guides boasted,\
  \ \u201Cthis is the second largest bell that rings in the world!\u201D  They recited\
  \ other facts proudly to us from a small tourism booklet.  Nasu introduced us to\
  \ his aunt making sugar cane juice, a drink akin to a syrupy-water version of the\
  \ milk leftover after eating Froot Loops, in the sea of vendors outside Mingun Stupa.\
  \  At U Bein Bridge, Tamu came running to my sister and me, smiling and carrying\
  \ traditional straw hats she\u2019d bought to shield us from the sun.  Tamu\u2019\
  s dimples invited us to smile with her.  \u201CThe sun here is very strong for you!\u201D\
  \ she doted on us.  The entrance of the bridge had another sign, \u201CWARMLY WELCOME\
  \ & BE KIND TO TOURISTS!\u201D  We would continue to see these billboards posted\
  \ all over Myanmar.  \n\nOur day ended sitting in a circle and chatting at Shwe\
  \ In Bin Kyaung, an ornate monastery with teak woodcarvings our friends didn\u2019\
  t consider to be a \u201Creal\u201D tourist attraction because it wasn\u2019t listed\
  \ in their book\u2014they just wanted somewhere quiet.  We read through English\
  \ sentences they had written in their notebooks, correcting for grammar and syntax.\
  \  They described their tourism studies curriculum to us, and how with Myanmar\u2019\
  s borders opening, they were eager to benefit from a lucrative tourism industry\
  \ just like their neighbor, Thailand, had.  I asked about the tourism billboards,\
  \ which seemed to excite rather than trouble them.  Were these signs not threatening\
  \ to them? No, they weren\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t be.  Their country was finally\
  \ opening up to the world\u2014and they were palpably excited to be a part of this\
  \ transformation."
