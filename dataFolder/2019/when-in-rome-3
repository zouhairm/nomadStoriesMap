Text: "\"I didn\u2019t expect to find someone like him\u2014 not there, in a country\
  \ like that. We had just reached Italy that evening. I won\u2019t lie though, I\
  \ had been warned. Okay, that\u2019s too loud of a word. Let\u2019s just say that\
  \ I had the knowledge in the back of my head that I would be vulnerable to something\
  \ like this\u2014 someone like this. Gentlemen like him seemed to be at every corner\
  \ I looked at that day, but I was trusted to be the smart one, one who couldn\u2019\
  t be fooled, or so my mother told me; I was blind to even notice it happening right\
  \ in front of my eyes.\"\n\nMy father went on with the story of which my sister\
  \ and I had counted to probably be the 12th or maybe the 13th repeat now. Yes, it\u2019\
  s probably the 13th. Jean never gets her facts wrong. She is the smart one. I\u2019\
  d say she got it from Papa. Anyway, it\u2019s been 67 days since we got back from\
  \ our European holiday, and Arnold and Mary were the current victims of Papa\u2019\
  s revised edition of the \"How my family got mugged in Italy\", story.\n\nIf I were\
  \ given the chance to narrate what was possibly a great experience, it would go\
  \ really differently; I live in Goa, the tiniest state of the multi- everything,\
  \ India, and getting robbed in Italy was probably the most exciting thing to have\
  \ happened to me, something that would make my resume into the cool group in college.\
  \ \n\nWe were 12 travelers in total: 3 families. Papa\u2019s two cousins, who were\
  \ brothers, and us. Taking the train always seemed like the more appealing option\
  \ for me. The view of the countryside: the greens and blues on the outside along\
  \ with the grins and blues on the inside of the window pane were all too amusing.\
  \ We reached Rome from Paris at about 4:30 pm, that evening. \n\nEveryone rushes\
  \ out of the train, running to get luggage trolleys for themselves, avoiding the\
  \ usual annoyances that want to be paid for being the hands and legs to pushing\
  \ our trolleys. After our luggage is sorted, we all head to join the back of the\
  \ surprisingly short line that formed in front of the currency conversion machine.\
  \ The first brother is followed by the second, and then comes Papa\u2019s turn.\n\
  \nThe clink of the coins filling the collector of the machine is undeniably loud\
  \ on a crowded station that has thousands of people engaging in their own activities.\
  \ \"Collect the coins and fill them into the pouches\", Papa ordered as we circled\
  \ around, \u2018protecting\u2019 our finances. And so we collect. One hand after\
  \ another picking up coins and putting them into the pouch. Until we realize that\
  \ two of the many hands, weren\u2019t ours. \n\nBrown tweed coat over a white collared\
  \ shirt worn on black trousers and brown moccasins, he self-invited himself into\
  \ our family for those brief 15 seconds wherein he pocketed more than 20 thousand\
  \ worth of Indian Rupees, and swiftly walked away. We turned to stop him only to\
  \ realize that every second person is dressed like him. \n\nRome and my family had\
  \ something in common that day. We both tried protecting our assets. We, our money\
  \ and she, her people. But only she succeeded that day. After all, Italy is crowned\
  \ the queen of the world\u2019s pickpockets. \n\nMost people travel to different\
  \ countries, but never really experience them. Italy gave us the type of local connection\
  \ in a day that would be hard to find in years in any other country. But it definitely\
  \ came at a price."
