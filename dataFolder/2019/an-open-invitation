Text: "Waiters bustle around the room with trays full of mint tea and Moroccan sweets.\
  \ I watch as family members kiss and hug each other, giving \u2018salaam\u2019 in\
  \ greeting. I am seated by who I come to learn is a cousin of the bride, at a table\
  \ in the center of the wedding hall. The wedding celebration is being held in a\
  \ large riad in the old city of Fez, Morocco. Yossef, my chaperone for the evening\
  \ points out the beautiful white detail running along the walls which he tells me\
  \ were carved by hand many years ago. When walking down the narrows streets of the\
  \ old city, you will be able to find similar handcrafted details carved along the\
  \ buildings. \n\n\nYossef and I had met for the first time that morning. It was\
  \ coming up to a week since I arrived in Fez and I was exhausted from searching\
  \ for somewhere to settle. I spent most days running back and forth between the\
  \ old and new city viewing apartments, haggling rent rates with the little Arabic\
  \ I knew.\nYossef is a married man with two young daughters. He rents his riads\
  \ to travellers and foreign students, occasionally inviting them to his home for\
  \ dinner and English lessons for his daughters. Before viewing the riad, Yossef\
  \ offered to give me a personalised tour of the old city. It wasn\u2019t a \u201C\
  Now, here is the famous blue gate \u2018Bab Boujloud\u2019\u201D kind of tour. It\
  \ was more, \u201CNow, here is the famous blue gate \u2018Bab Boujloud\u2019. But\
  \ if you look opposite you will find a woman who makes the most beautiful perfumes\
  \ and soaps\u201D. To this day, Yossef has given me one of the best tours anyone\
  \ could offer. It wasn\u2019t solely focused on the city\u2019s attractions but\
  \ more on the people who lived and worked there. I\u2019m extremely thankful of\
  \ him for that because they soon became my neighbours. He personally introduced\
  \ me to shop and restaurant owners who were all very kind and hospitable. Each owner\
  \ would offer me a seat and a cup of tea, they were so welcoming that it was difficult\
  \ to say no. They\u2019d humour my Arabic as I tried to introduce myself, we\u2019\
  d have small talk with Yossef as my translator for the most part. It was an overwhelming\
  \ experience, but I loved every moment of it. I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around\
  \ how personable everyone was. It was then I decided I would only look for homes\
  \ within the old city, in fact the first place Yossef shows me, I\u2019d take it.\
  \ \nYossef seemed extremely proud of the place he came from which made me value\
  \ the tour all the more so. The last shop owner he introduced me to was a butcher.\
  \ (I thought it would be better not to mention the fact I am a vegetarian to not\
  \ dampen the mood). Instead of a cup of tea, the butcher offered me an invitation.\
  \ A wedding was being held nearby and he thought I would enjoy it. I don\u2019t\
  \ think it is common to be invited to stranger\u2019s wedding by your local butcher\
  \ nor to accept said invite. However, hours later I am dressed in a beautiful red\
  \ Jilaba, a traditional Moroccan robe. Sitting amongst the other wedding guests\
  \ and Yossef, who do not seem to batter an eyelid at my attendance. The question,\
  \ how did I get here? Jumps into mind first as we\u2019re eating the six-course\
  \ meal, then as I\u2019m playing with a group of young girls intrigued by my hair\
  \ and piercings. Again, as I am dancing with grandmothers and definitely as I\u2019\
  m standing ever so awkwardly for photos with the happy couple. Around 5am Yossef\
  \ drives me back to my hostel in the new medina. \u201CHow did I get here?\u201D\
  \ easily becomes \u201Cthis is amazing. I can\u2019t believe I was just there!\u201D\
  \ If you are to ever visit the old city of Fez, I encourage you to start conversation\
  \ with the locals you come across. Engage with the people who make your travel experiences\
  \ that much more memorable and who knows, you may just find yourself at a wedding.\
  \ \n\n\nPatricia Mulumba."
