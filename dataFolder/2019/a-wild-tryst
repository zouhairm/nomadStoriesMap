Text: "This night at the silent yet thunderous jungle of Corbett was thrilling! For\
  \ a person of my caliber, who terrifies to even watch a small spooky commercial\
  \ on television, Yeah! Spending the entire night camping in the interiors of this\
  \ extensive woodland wasn\u2019t coming effortless. Did I mention the only source\
  \ of light was the moon smiling over our petite endeavour to be adventurous? When\
  \ the day started with a jeep ride to observe the offerings of this wide area, it\
  \ felt good but still typical. Excitement is not the outcome of what you hear from\
  \ others but what you feel within \u2013 was understood during this journey. It\u2019\
  s for all those who usually opt for a couple of hours visit to any jungle, if you\
  \ haven\u2019t slept with the feral creations you haven\u2019t experienced the wild.\
  \ The door to forest opens like an invite to dare you. Beware you are here - but\
  \ can you adore my beauty and appreciate my beastly jigs all at once. \n\nSun was\
  \ saying adios for the day when we arrived at the forest. Lustrous leaves of trees\
  \ around were as beautiful as the sky above. In this serene surrounding we halted\
  \ near the river. Wish it was just to sit and admire the beauty; however, the stop\
  \ was to change the means of transportation. A small boat was used to sail to the\
  \ other end.\n\nEven before I knew, the adventure had started. We walked around\
  \ one kilometre to reach the designated base camp. Holding one stick to enable dodging\
  \ small hurdles wasn\u2019t convincing enough. Out of concern I asked the man who\
  \ was a local and also working with the camp organisers, walking along with our\
  \ 7 members\u2019 team with an equally fragile stick in hand. \u201CSir what\u2019\
  s the action plan if a tiger approaches us now?\u201D And without delay he gives\
  \ me an uncomplicated smile and says \u201Cnothing. There\u2019s no plan but all\
  \ you need to do is stand still and not panic.\u201D Easily said I thought. But\
  \ there was something in his smile that gave me the confidence to cover rest of\
  \ the distance without panicking. I guess he knew this isn\u2019t the usual path\
  \ for a tiger and they were dwelling in further denser parts of forest.\n\nTents\
  \ and the wooden low benches and chairs were shimmering in the moonlight, when we\
  \ reached. The camp area was fenced using electric wires. One large shelter was\
  \ made for the kitchen and many separate tents for us to sleepover. \n\nAfter placing\
  \ our backpacks in respective tents, as instructed to us, we turned off the lanterns\
  \ while leaving the tents. No one desired unwanted attention from our untamed neighbours\
  \ by keeping the place lit up. Small campfire was arranged to fight the chillness\
  \ and experience our meal \u2018only\u2019 with nature. When we were prepared to\
  \ sustain the warmth, fire was slowing turned down, letting us sense the real power\
  \ of moon. At that moment all the manmade illuminants felt worthless. The forest\
  \ ranger made time additionally interesting by the amount of remarkable stories\
  \ he shared.\n\nIt was the undying splendour of nature that was making me courageous\
  \ with the passing time. Suddenly I started feeling comfortable in the moments impromptu.\
  \ There was a cry from a distant region. The ranger said it\u2019s a wild boar.\
  \ Willingness to grab more and more was the expectation. Secretly I desired just\
  \ for once to hear a tiger\u2019s roar. Though fearfully but my entire purpose of\
  \ this expedition was to get sight of the sovereign of the forest. As much as I\
  \ was soaking up every bit of this mystical night, I couldn\u2019t wait for the\
  \ morning safari. The insects continued chirping as we crawled in to our cozy beds."
