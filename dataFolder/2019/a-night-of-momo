Text: "The five of us and twenty children, huddled over a table in the dim light of\
  \ the schools dining area. The trees gently rustle but it\u2019s difficult to hear\
  \ anything over the voices. Shouts of joy erupt as another bowl is brought to the\
  \ work station. Grunts of exertion can be heard from all around as we pound into\
  \ the mountain of dough that sits looming over us. I am not sure what temperature\
  \ it is. I can feel the wind on my arms, but the sweat dripping from foreheads tells\
  \ me a different story. \n\nIt may have been a mistake to tell the children in the\
  \ morning that we would be making momo for dinner. The excitement throughout the\
  \ day was infectious and meant that little work got done in the school rooms. Most\
  \ volunteers had no idea what a \"momo\" was, but after having the same vegetable\
  \ daal for every meal, we too were eagerly anticipating the change. \n\nAs the sun\
  \ set behind the hilltops, a flurry of activity erupted in this isolated corner\
  \ of Nepal. Children spilled into a lightly sheltered dining room, dragging the\
  \ other volunteers, the few stray dogs and whatever utensils they had scavenged\
  \ from the school yard. Myself and the other inexperienced foreigners were given\
  \ a quick tutorial from a young boy (\u201Cjust pinch and twist!\u201D) and were\
  \ sent on our way. Sleeves rolled up under armpits and hair secured in tight plaits,\
  \ we were ready for battle. \n\nA tiny girl below me, no older than four years old,\
  \ was wrestling with a pile of dough the same size as herself. The concentration\
  \ set in her little eyebrows was admirable. She punched the massive mound in front\
  \ of her, almost falling into the bowl on more than one occasion. A factory line\
  \ was quickly established under the strict instructions of the children, roll, cut,\
  \ fill, pinch, roll, cut, fill, pinch. So engrossed in our task we hardly noticed\
  \ when the first batch was suddenly thrown out of the pot. We paused our work for\
  \ a moment to admire our creation. A steaming pot of dumplings floating in broth.\
  \ \n\nAn explosion of hands, spoons and bowls descended onto the bounty, the pot\
  \ emptied in seconds, eagerly awaiting a refill. The dough balls were presented\
  \ to us foreigners by small hands and eager eyes, awaiting our thoughts on their\
  \ beloved traditions. Food is one of the most powerful ways to make connections.\
  \ As we stood rolling our sheets of dough, the children told us stories of when\
  \ they had made them at home with their families. They explained how the method\
  \ differed from how their grandmothers make it in their villages. There was arguments\
  \ I couldn't understand over which fillings were to be deemed the best and agreements\
  \ that although ours were not perfect, they were still pretty great. \n\nThat night,\
  \ while stuffing our faces and trying not to burn our hands on the piping hot broth,\
  \ we learned about not only the food, but the people who had made it. One young\
  \ boy told us of his dream to return to his village and set up a school just like\
  \ the one he lived in now. He wanted to be able to spread the joy and opportunity\
  \ he had received here to his friends back home who had been affected by the earthquake.\
  \ We learned that some of these children don\u2019t have any homes to go back to,\
  \ don\u2019t have any families outside of the one we were becoming a part of. \n\
  \nPulled onto the makeshift dance floor, we were thought traditional dances in between\
  \ dumpling batches. The jumping only increasing our appetite. We exchanged tokens\
  \ in our native languages: Namast\u0113 for dia dhuit, ol\xE1, privet and gamarjoba.\
  \ We ate, laughed, sang and danced well past all of our bed times. As we trudged\
  \ back to our makeshift shelter, I knew that after tonight, it was not the days\
  \ we had hiked in the Himalayan valleys or wandered through the crazy streets of\
  \ Kathmandu that had allowed me to truly see what it meant to live and be in the\
  \ Nepal; it was the momo in the tiny village on the mountain tops."
