Text: "My curiosity got the best of me as I secured my place beside the balding, hunched\
  \ middle-aged man, on the slightly-elevated concrete pavement of the filling station-\
  \ our bus had broken down at Ahoda, Rivers State. \u201CWhat\u2019s with all the\
  \ military checkpoints?\u201D I soliloquised. The soldiers were straight-faced,\
  \ readily-armed and built for any form of attack. Within five minutes, this was\
  \ our fourth: every passenger acting \u201Ctoo natural\u201D, I mused.\n\nIt was\
  \ my first time and I wanted perfection. My rose-gold iPhone 6 produced soft Jorja\
  \ Smith music that set the mood; my mid-thigh khaki shorts and my brother\u2019\
  s \u2018borrowed\u2019 T-shirt with just my sports bra underneath translated my\
  \ closeness to comfort. Moreover, the expanding air with slight rumbles of thunder,\
  \ left me longing to see what the next eleven hours would unfold; wet travelling-\
  \ perfect. South! My anticipation was uncontainable.\n\n'Ogu-Bolo' is a seacoast\
  \ rustic community in Rivers State (population: 74683), where 'Kpo Fire' was a big\
  \ business. \u2018Kpo Fire\u2019- crude oil poured on fire- was the name for illegal\
  \ oil bunkering in the South, carried out on sites called \u2018dumps\u2019. The\
  \ illegal government sponsors were referred to as \u2018Barons\u2019. In these dumps,\
  \ crude oil was refined illegally and sorted into smaller fuels like petrol and\
  \ diesel, for personal gain. Rumour has it the Nigerian Navy was involved.\n\nOur\
  \ white eleven-seater bus, now decorated with dew droplets, accelerated like a snail\
  \ on wheels as we departed the dark 'Ojota' park. Satisfied with my second row window-seat,\
  \ I recalled our driver\u2019s promise in pidgin English, \u201Cas you see me eh,\
  \ my bus be the best bus for here; I sabi drive.\u201D Our bus vibrated with laughter,\
  \ giving room for side interactions- as if the driver opened the jar of familiarity.\
  \ After all, a memorable trip, he promised. \n\nThe South is really hot with militants.\
  \ I\u2019d heard of its happenings and illegal activities but this was the closest\
  \ opportunity I\u2019d gotten to hear from a firsthand witness.\n\nIt was high noon.\
  \ Our first \u2018stretch-your-legs\u2019 stop exposed me to varieties of street\
  \ foods which would make your taste buds cry in ecstasy: yes, that good. To cut\
  \ my expenses, I planned on sticking to fruits but, the tantalising whiff of smoke\
  \ from \u2018suya\u2019 invited me to the roasted meat stand- it tasted even better.\
  \ Banana and groundnut followed, alongside locally-roasted peppered snails on a\
  \ stick the length of a pencil.\n\nFishing is a major occupation down South. Mr.\
  \ Michael explained that the birth of angry militants gave the hopeless citizens\
  \ a cause to keep fighting for. 'Kpo Fire' destroyed their state- polluted their\
  \ water: killed the seafoods. Soot- a respiratory illness- also surfaced due to\
  \ smoke inhalation. They gradually lost their means of livelihood, source of drinking\
  \ water, water recreations as well. \n\nMoney was being made; militants felt cheated\
  \ as they were left without compensation. Poverty loomed- which fuelled their aggressive\
  \ protests by vandalising oil pipelines, fighting the government, kidnapping high\
  \ officials and more. It was a period of national unrest. \n\nOur cheery bus driver,\
  \ in order to avoid traffic ahead, announced a short-cut- a very narrow untarred\
  \ road, lined with thick bushes on either side- I thought we wouldn't fit. After\
  \ we paused for another \u2018stretch-your-legs\u2019 moment, our bus\u2019 ignition\
  \ refused timelessly to cooperate. Patience tormented us.\n\nMy thoughts deliberately\
  \ concluded that the excessive army checkpoints were put in place to safeguard those\
  \ oil pipelines. Hmm.\n\nWord was, the militants seized the oil to make good use\
  \ for the people. Another 'Robin Hood'. Of course, this also bore consequences,\
  \ as the state was driving away potential investors thereby de-marketing the nation\u2019\
  s economy.\n\nNoting the fading daylight, I left the pavement to seek information\
  \ on the traffic. The 'Ijaw' music bursting through the speakers prompted my rhythmic\
  \ bodily-movements. Upon returning, Mr. Michael shook his balding head, \u201Cthat\u2019\
  s how it happens here.\u201D It was the army making passage for a two-star General.\
  \ \n\nFinally, our bus left the station: this time, at a regulated speed- ensuring\
  \ timeliness. Guaranteed it was my first time; but the fascination pushed me to\
  \ think I was getting to the South even if we had to use a boat. \n\nMy teacher\
  \ had led me through places our bus couldn't."
