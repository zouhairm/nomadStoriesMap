Text: "The Germans have lost battles, wars, kingdoms and even their own citizens.\
  \ Today, the Nation\u2019s capital has to figure out how to remember these things,\
  \ without glorifying them, and it\u2019s not easy.\n\nGermany is a complicated nation.\
  \ It are burdened with the task of memorializing not only the shame of atrocious\
  \ crimes committed during Nazi-era Germany, but also the horrific loss those acts\
  \ caused to the physical and human geography of Europe. Berliners in particular\
  \ have struck the delicate balance that's fundamental memorializing both types of\
  \ loss with dignity and truth. The question remains: do memorials exist to remind\
  \ the perpetrators of their crime, or to pay homage to the victims of a crime?\n\
  \nThis is the quandary architect Peter Eisenman was faced with in 2003 when he began\
  \ designing the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Controversial in almost\
  \ every way possible, the country seems to be equally divided on whether to chalk\
  \ the memorial up as a cultural win. Some have been turned off by the overall morbidity\
  \ of the thing, saying it does a better job of memorializing the crimes of the National\
  \ Socialist (Nazi) party, rather than marking eternally the memory of the Holocaust\
  \ victims. Others consider it a reminder to the city Berlin and to the nation of\
  \ the terrible history that no citizen would ever wish to relive.\n\nAs a tourist\
  \ and an artist, I was impressed by the monument\u2019s ability to engender an emotional\
  \ response within me. Ten-foot tall blocks of porous concrete blinded me from all\
  \ sides and deadened the sound from every direction. Its maze-like design gives\
  \ off the impression that the tombstones are actually growing taller as you walk\
  \ through the memorial.  That feeling -- an overwhelming sense of doom an existential\
  \ dread that arrives suddenly and without warning -- has stuck with me long after\
  \ I left that space. While trekking through, I found myself suddenly alone: no one\
  \ with whom I had entered was in sight or earshot. From what I understand, this\
  \ feeling of isolation was the intended effect. So, mission accomplished."
