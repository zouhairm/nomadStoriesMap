Text: "I flattened down into the seat of the small boat - terrified. A colourful snake\
  \ dangled a mere arms length above my head on an overhanging branch. Osmond, my\
  \ guide, was laughing while shaking the tree violently. Moments ago I had just seen\
  \ a crocodile bigger than my car back in Canada dart down into the murky water from\
  \ the bank of the river. I was full-on panicking.\n \nOsmond began laughing even\
  \ more and imitated the fat monkey with the floppy nose watching us from across\
  \ the water. A large monitor lizard slithered along the shoreline. A water buffalo\
  \ looked on silently. My heart danced and my eyes wandered. Everything else was\
  \ still. I thought back to the morning, and the soothing voice of Osmond\u2019s\
  \ young daughter, singing along to the T.V. as we packed: \u201CI\u2019m only one,\
  \ call away\u2026\u201D\n\nNever, ever, in my life did I think that I would be in\
  \ the jungles of Borneo, Malaysia at sunrise, searching for wildlife along the Kinabatangan\
  \ river. Growing up, I was the kid that was too scared to leave my home. I bawled\
  \ when we moved houses just down the road. I even actually dreamt of being a mailman\
  \ in my own neighbourhood. \n\nSo how did I find myself here? Well, it\u2019s kind\
  \ of a cheesy story. In my last year of University I was a bit lost and feeling\
  \ down about my future, as 4th year students tend to be. Then, totally out of the\
  \ blue, I received an email from myself that I had sent while in Highschool four\
  \ years previously (I had used a website that would send emails to any future date).\
  \ It read: \n\n\u201CDear future Hebb, \nLooking good big guy ;) \nJust in case\
  \ you have no plans after university, here are some things that your highschool-self\
  \ was dreaming about one day\u2026\u201D\n\nIncluded on that list were volunteer\
  \ opportunities, educational endeavours, and jobs overseas that I had long forgotten\
  \ about. At the very top was a phone number for a teaching company based in Seoul,\
  \ South Korea. I made the call. \n\nThat spring, instead of walking across the stage\
  \ to pick up my completed diploma, I skipped the ceremony and hopped on a plane\
  \ bound for another country another world away. It was a crazy decision for me.\
  \ To make it even crazier, I had decided that I would say YES to everything during\
  \ my first two months in South Korea in order to make new friends and have new adventures.\
  \ It totally worked. I got no sleep for weeks, but enjoyed many fun late nights\
  \ out and weekend trips meeting people. On one of those late nights I had said \u201C\
  YES!\u201D to spending a week touring the Malaysian jungle, much to the malaise\
  \ of my parents and hungover-self. \n\nSo there I was, hugging the bottom of the\
  \ boat with my three new friends and \u201CThe Snake Man\u201D, Osmond. I stared\
  \ up at the viper, noticing the gleaming beauty of its colourful scales for the\
  \ first time (and so close too)! Osmond suddenly steered the boat towards the proboscis\
  \ monkey happily munching its leafy breakfast, and pointed towards the sky. \u201C\
  Look! Hornbills! Four of them! They always stay close with family!\u201D\n\nI thought\
  \ of my parents, and how much they would love hearing about this trip from me. The\
  \ profile of the great bird soared into the sky. I finally laughed, relieved to\
  \ be completely alive in that moment. I was so happy that I had said yes to this\
  \ whole adventure - to leaving home, to trying something different, and to making\
  \ new friends.\n\nWe got back to Osmond\u2019s homestay for an early lunch, and\
  \ I swear, his daughter was still sitting there in front of the T.V, singing. Her\
  \ youthful voice rang through the riverside home: \u201CI\u2019m only one, call\
  \ away. I\u2019ll be there to save, the day\u2026\u201D That moment in the boat\
  \ was truly worth answering all those calls. \n\nThe next time that you\u2019re\
  \ presented with an adventurous opportunity, take the leap and I promise, you\u2019\
  ll find plenty of those moments too. You\u2019re always only one call away from\
  \ home, and so is your next adventure."
