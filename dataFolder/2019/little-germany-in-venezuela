Text: "Gasoline is the cheapest here. It\u2019s only about a cent for a litre.\u201D\
  \n\u201CConvert a hundred dollars at black market price, and live like a queen for\
  \ a month!\u201D \n\u201CWhen you step out on the streets, slip your mobile phone\
  \ through the waistband in your pants and let them sweat for a while. This is one\
  \ place that the muggers- who come at the speed of light on motorbikes and disappear\
  \ with your phone- don\u2019t know of yet.\u201D \nThe day I reached Venezuela my\
  \ host sister, Mariela enlightened me with these three facts. The last one made\
  \ me doubt my decision. \n\nThere was still a week until my internship as an English\
  \ Language teacher started. Mariela and I planned to make most of this time. The\
  \ very next day, taking an hour long flight, we reached Caracas. Staying overnight,\
  \ the next morning we took a bus to La Colonia Tovar- a small German Town about\
  \ 48 kilometres from Caracas. Mariela let me sit on the window seat. I drew the\
  \ pink curtains and looked at the running buildings. \u201CEl presente es de lucha,\u201D\
  \ said a large banner, with a furious man pointing out his finger. More billboards\
  \ filled with Spanish words passed. Spanish words, running one after another. Back\
  \ then, at the university I had never thought of meeting them outside my Spanish\
  \ book. I was good at reading and writing. However, I would freeze at the thought\
  \ of speaking. On being asked questions I would turn red and freeze, making a complete\
  \ fool of myself in front of the whole class.\n \n\u201CToma mija,\u201D a woman\
  \ in her early fifties, who stood with a box full of teque\xF1os, interrupted my\
  \ thoughts. \u201CShe is offering you teque\xF1os,\u201D Mariela, my host sister\
  \ and translator for the journey, came to my rescue. I picked a few and thanked\
  \ her,  receiving the warmest smile back. The bus was furiously swirling up the\
  \ mountains. I could see the red houses with low-slope roofs through white magical\
  \ mist. Leaning my head against the window, I let myself be drowned in music. \"\
  Me voy enamorando..oh ouho...me voy enamorando...\" people cheered as the song played.\
  \ It was the only Venezuelan song I knew. I had heard it 10 times in two days, and\
  \ the fact that I could repeat a few lines in my head made me smile at my achievement.\
  \ A few songs later, we reached our destination. \n\nLa Colonia Tovar was inhabited\
  \ by the German settlers in mid 19th century and built according to the German architecture.\
  \ It\u2019s a place that has somehow managed to pop out of children's story books.\
  \ We spent the day strolling around the town, appreciating the white buildings framed\
  \ out of dark wood; savouring the most famous \u2018fresa con crema' (strawberries\
  \ with cream); and checking out the colorful street stalls laden with jars of cookies,\
  \ sweet pickles, and dulce de leche. After going around the town and clicking lots\
  \ of pictures, we sat down to eat in a nice German restaurant with waitresses dressed\
  \ in ruffled apron dresses. Soon, it started to get dark. We were to catch the last\
  \ bus to Caracas when I lost Mariela. There I was 14,000 kilometres away from home,\
  \ lost in the second most dangerous country in the world. With teary eyes, I walked\
  \ from person to person describing Mariela and asking if they had seen her.\n \u201C\
  Omigawwd!  You speak Spanish!\u201D Mariela appeared out of nowhere. \n We finally\
  \ boarded the overcrowded bus to Caracas.\n\u201CMari, ask the driver to play some\
  \ music,\u201D I requested. \n\u201CAsk it yourself.\u201D She smirked. \n\u201C\
  Se\xF1or! La musica, por favour,\u201D I said out loud.\nThe driver said something\
  \ and laughed. \n\u201CHe says, you\u2019re asking a lot from this old dying bus,\u201D\
  \ Mariela snorted. \nJust then, we heard the chords of guitar strike. I turned around\
  \ to see a guy leaning against the door with a guitar. He played \"me voy enamorando\"\
  \ on demand, and everyone joined him. I was the loudest.\nYears later, I would remember\
  \ my six months spent in Venezuela as the most vibrant, colourful, and vivid painting\
  \ alive in my memory."
