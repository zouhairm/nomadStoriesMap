Text: "The first time Fatou saw me, she screamed and hid. She peered at me through\
  \ her mother\u2019s legs, her little eyebrows drawn together in confusion. She whispered\
  \ words I didn\u2019t understand.\n\n\u201CShe thinks you\u2019re a monster!\u201D\
  \ the adults around us roared, wiping tears of laughter from their eyes. Excellent.\
  \ A few days in Senegal and I was already frightening the local children. \n\nI\
  \ smiled and crouched down. She ran away.\n\nLater that night, I couldn\u2019t get\
  \ her face out of my head. I hated that I had scared her. I love kids! I have a\
  \ niece and nephew! I taught children for years! \n\nI researched the creature she\
  \ had mistaken me for, Kankurang. In the local Mandinka culture, Kankurang is a\
  \ protector who attends coming-of-age ceremonies for boys. He\u2019s represented\
  \ by a man who wears a costume resembling a giant, reddish mop, with leaves and\
  \ bark attached. If that\u2019s what I looked like to the locals, I was going to\
  \ have a hell of a time making friends.\n\nThat first night, I was scared to sleep\
  \ in that house, in the middle of nowhere, in a country I didn\u2019t know. It was\
  \ hot. Every sound woke me. Every itch made me jump. I was relieved when morning\
  \ came.\n\nLater that week, I saw Fatou peeking at me as I waited for my ride to\
  \ the university, where I\u2019d be teaching. \n\n\u201C\xC7a va?\u201D I called.\
  \ She stared at me for a moment before going inside. Strike two.\n\nI paced as I\
  \ waited for the truck. This was it! Would my colleagues be helpful? Would my students\
  \ like me? My palms started to sweat, and I wished I could take it all back, go\
  \ home, run away like Fatou.\n\nTime passed and I got more comfortable. The security\
  \ guard now allowed me to walk to the corner shop to buy water. My French was waking\
  \ up after lying dormant in my brain for a decade. My students and colleagues had\
  \ welcomed me with the famous Senegalese hospitality known as \u201Cteranga.\u201D\
  \ \n\nFatou was playing outside with some other kids when I came home from school\
  \ one afternoon. She smiled as I got out of the car.\n\nThe children called me over.\
  \ They all spoke French, which they were learning at school. Fatou was too little\
  \ for school, so she stayed quiet. The older ones wanted to show me their games,\
  \ wanted to sing me a song, wanted to warn me about the neighborhood menace known\
  \ as \u201Cle chien m\xE9chant,\u201D or the mean dog.\n\n\u201C\xC7a va, Fatou?\u201D\
  \ I said quietly. She looked at me. \n\n\u201C\xC7a va\u2026toubab?\u201D she said.\
  \ The guard and other children laughed loudly. \u201CToubab\u201D means white person\
  \ in Wolof, the local language. \n\n\u201CFair call, Fatou.\u201D I thought. \u201C\
  I am the neighborhood toubab.\u201D\n\nThe next day I was waiting for the truck,\
  \ looking forward to my lessons. I heard a noise behind me. It was Fatou. She turned\
  \ and ran as soon as I saw her, but she was giggling. She reached her gate and closed\
  \ it just enough so that I could only see a sliver of her small face. She was breathless\
  \ from running and laughing. She had gotten so close to the monster! \n\nI giggled\
  \ back. \u201C\xC7a va, Fatou?\u201D \n\n\u201C\xC7a vaaaa, touuubaaaaaab!\u201D\
  \ A belly laugh escaped her mouth and filled the hot morning air.\n\nFor the next\
  \ few weeks, that became our game. \u201CTOUUUBAAAAAB!\u201D she called. \n\n\u201C\
  FATOUUUUU!\u201D I responded.\n\n\LOne day, I was talking to the guard outside,\
  \ finally capable of having a simple conversation in French. Fatou approached us.\
  \ She stood next to me for a moment. Not wanting to scare her, I didn\u2019t say\
  \ or do anything. She took my hand. \n\nWe sat down. I cut up a sweet, crisp apple\
  \ and we shared it. She chatted in Wolof. I chatted back in French, in English,\
  \ in gestures, in the little Wolof I had picked up. She was animated as she spoke.\
  \ Her little eyebrows, once furrowed in fear, now danced as she told me a story.\n\
  \nHer mom called out for her. She stood up and smiled. \u201CToubab!\u201D she said.\
  \ \n\n\u201CFatou!\u201D I replied. \n\nShe scampered off, her tiny feet raising\
  \ a cloud of dust behind her."
