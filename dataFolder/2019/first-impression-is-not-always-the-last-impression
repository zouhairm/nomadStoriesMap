Text: "It was almost midnight when we reached Leh. We got off from the bus. Within\
  \ few seconds all our fellow passengers disappeared in the darkness and we were\
  \ standing at the middle of nowhere. We didn't know where we were standing, if it\
  \ was a village in the middle of gigantic mountains or a town full of people around\
  \ we had no clue. We went there with minimum amount of information, no itinerary,\
  \  no plans also with no signal on our phone and we didn't know what to expect from\
  \ the trip and and the place.\n We started walking towards the light from the bus\
  \ stand. There was no one at the streets but it was not empty. There were a dozens\
  \ of street dogs which were barking at us. But we kept walking in search of Shelter\
  \ for the night. We saw a man waving at us. We stared walking towards his direction.\
  \ He was pointing to a guest house and trying to convinced us go to there in sign\
  \ language. We figured couldn't speak. We had no other option but to follow him.\
  \ We entered the guest house. There was only one light on at the reception and we\
  \ saw only a boy who was sitting there. There was no one else we could see in that\
  \ guest house. They say there was only one room left which was expensive. It was\
  \ hard to believe but we were too tired to argue after 20 hours of exhausting bus\
  \ journey. We were heading to our room when we saw two police men entering to the\
  \ guest house. As were were contemplating in our head what must have been going\
  \ on outside the boy from the reception knocked at the door. He entered the room\
  \ and talked to someone over phone \"There's problem. Police has come here. Reach\
  \ soon.\" We kept asking what happened but he didn't say a word. The night was heavy\
  \ and all bad thoughts were crossing through our minds. We were not sure how our\
  \ morning was going to be or whether we had made the right decision by going there.\n\
  I opened my eyes and it was 10 in the morning. The day started late. We checked\
  \ out from the guest house and went out. After that night we were not expecting\
  \ much from the day. But it was bright and sunny. As we went out we realized that\
  \ we were at the heart of the Leh. It was the Main Bazar. Different people had come\
  \ from different parts of the world. As we looked up we could see a beautiful palace\
  \ at the top of the mountain  from the Bazar. We started climbing towards the palace\
  \ and we lost our track when a local women came held my the and led us to the Palace.\
  \ As we stand at the head of the town we saw mesmerizing snow capped mountains.\
  \ The town with small houses. Beautiful people with a smile on their face and we\
  \ realized how wrong we were about the place and the people. We also met bunch of\
  \ beautiful people on that trip who helped us selflessly. But how we've forgotten\
  \ to trust people. I felt petty on me being judgemental and having preconceived\
  \ notion about people. At first I didn't know what to expect from the trip but now\
  \ I do. I've learnt to see a place and people without preconceived notion with acceptance\
  \ and a lot of love. Oh and did I tell you that she also invited us to the mela\
  \ that happens every Saturday at the main bazar .Where people come from different\
  \ valleys and perform their traditional dance and songs. Guess what that day was\
  \ Saturday. We went to the mela and enjoyed the evening with beautiful people and\
  \ a beautiful sunset at the mountain. And the day ended beautifully and unexpectedly."
