Text: "It has been 13 years since I\u2019ve been in Nigeria, the Motherland.  With\
  \ each year that passes, I feel more and more distant to the point where I wonder\
  \ whether I\u2019ve left it too late. Have I become a stranger to my own country?\
  \ This is why a wedding invitation, out of the blue, feels like an arm has been\
  \ extended out to me and all I have to do is reach out for it.\n\nA few weeks later\
  \ and I\u2019m arriving at my cousin\u2019s family home. It\u2019s loud and hot.\
  \ Food is being prepared over stoves. Large crates of drinks are being brought in\
  \ and people are rushing back and forth, carrying bags full of clothes.\n\nAs I\
  \ enter, I make my greetings to faces I don\u2019t recall, or maybe I never even\
  \ knew them to begin with. I lower myself so that I am half kneeling, half bowing\
  \ the customary way to address an elder. All of this I know, but my body feels awkward\
  \ trying to ensure I get it right. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take me long to realise that\
  \ my cousin, the bride, is not here. Instead, I\u2019m met with her grandma. She\
  \ smiles, her wrinkles deepening as she motions for me to come closer. I try to\
  \ respond to her words in Yoruba, but my tongue is not complying and I fumble over\
  \ the words. She  laughs and teases me on my efforts.  \n\nSo here, I am. The stranger\
  \ in the corner. Conversations flow quick and fast over me, most of which I can\
  \ understand, but joining in would be another challenge entirely. I feel myself\
  \ withdrawing. Out of country, out of place. I\u2019m surrounded by family, but\
  \ I feel distant. It\u2019s here where I wonder if I\u2019ve made a mistake, maybe\
  \ it\u2019s too late to reconcile with this country, maybe that time has passed.\n\
  \nAnd in a flurry, my cousin arrives and she sweeps me away with her. We\u2019re\
  \ off running last minute errands before the big day. She aggressively manoeuvres\
  \ through the pot holed roads. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing me to sweat\
  \ more - the dry heat from the overhead sun, or that she\u2019s driving without\
  \ a license. We arrive at the market, park the car and head into a hollowed out\
  \ space between two buildings. It looks like an alleyway with stalls running one\
  \ after the other. I follow my cousins lead as we push through row after row of\
  \ store fronts. We\u2019re bombarded with offers: beads, old DVDs, necklaces, shoes,\
  \ bags, earrings. We hop across muddy puddles and make our way to purchase the final\
  \ pieces before the wedding. \n\nThe big day arrives. \n\nI\u2019m in a hotel suite\
  \ with the rest of the bridesmaids. The room is overfilled and we all stumble to\
  \ find space to get ready. I find a quiet corner to change and slip into my aso-ebi,\
  \ the pink bejewelled garment selected for the bridesmaids. It surprises me that\
  \ it fits. I\u2019d chosen the style and sent my measurements across the ocean.\
  \ It\u2019s tight but it\u2019ll do. \n\nWe hurry to get downstairs in time, so\
  \ we help each other. Zips are pulled, lost shoes are found, make up is applied\
  \ and retouched. I sit down as one of the bridesmaids helps me tie my gele, the\
  \ traditional headpiece. She weaves it into shape over my head until she\u2019s\
  \ happy.\n\nAnd when the bride is ready, we surround her, every arm is extended\
  \ with a phone trying to take a thousand pictures. She twirls around in her cream\
  \ grown as we clap and cheer. \n\nThe photographer grows impatient; it must be tiring\
  \ to try to herd us together for our group photo. Eventually we close in together,\
  \ a cream dress surrounded in a sea of pink jewels."
