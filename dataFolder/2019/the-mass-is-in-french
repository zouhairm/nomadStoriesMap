Text: "The inherent beauty of backpacking in East Africa is the only certainty that\
  \ you wake up with is that you will certainly be confused that day.\nMy friend Asha\
  \ and I had just come  to Foyer de Charitie. A covenant/spiritual retreat center\
  \ nestled in a small village in the Twin Lakes region of Rwanda. The convent overlooks\
  \ the volcanic Virunga mountain range; internationally known as the only home of\
  \ mountain guerillas. \n\nIt had been a very mountainous, muddy, and incredibly\
  \ exhilarating/terrifying forty-five minute boda boda ride to the this tiny village\
  \ that even our drivers didn't seem to know. Frantically pointing at Google Maps\
  \ directions on your phone is a poor substitute for French! Any frustrations were\
  \ immediately wiped from my mind once we finally made it to the retreat center.\
  \ Ever felt just sucker punched at the nature's sheer awesome beauty? That's exactly\
  \ what happened to me when I first laid eyes on Foyer de Charitie at sunset. I was\
  \ so overcome by joy I paid my boda boda driver twice the the amount that we had\
  \ agreed upon. Nothing could wipe the grin off my face, I felt like I had come to\
  \ paradise.\n\nUnfortunately the bliss did not last long. A rather stern faced nun\
  \ came to the door, accompanied by two Swiss children. A brother and sister duo,\
  \ they were the children of neighboring farmers. . The sister did not speak much\
  \ English and she instructed the English-speaking Swiss children to tell Asha that\
  \ the spiritual retreat center was closed to visitors for the next few weeks in\
  \ preparation for Easter. This directly contradicted their website which stated\
  \ they were open.\n\nAsha and I asked what we were supposed to do as there was no\
  \ boda boda driver in sight and it was getting very dark. While the boda boda ride\
  \ had been more fun then scary during the day neither of us felt comfortable going\
  \ down the muddy, steep, mountain road at night. The sister was unimpressed with\
  \ our predicament and insisted that we go back down the mountain.\n\nThings had\
  \ suddenly taken a turn for the worse. Asha was pissed at me for dragging her all\
  \ the way up here, the kids were looking at us with pitying glances, and the sister\
  \ was looking at me like she could smell the rainy day beers we had drank earlier.\
  \ I felt judged and convicted, like I wasn't good enough to stay at this incredibly\
  \ beautiful spiritual haven. \n\nUnwilling to admit defeat, I pulled out a card,\
  \ I hadn't pulled in a long while: my background of growing up in a very strong\
  \ Roman Catholic house hold. I was the theology department medal winner in high\
  \ school for Christ's sake! I explained to the sister that I was a Catholic and\
  \ to think of us as pilgrims. I pleaded that we would require absolutely no work,\
  \  wouldn't need any food, and would stay as far away from where the sisters lived\
  \ and worked as possible while paying full price. I promised to pray and inquired\
  \ what time mass would begin.\nThe sister remained stone faced, unmoved by my Catholic\
  \ charm, she coolly replied, \"The Mass is in French.\"\nShe went back inside and\
  \ told us she would try to find us two boda drivers. \n\nAsha and I both sank to\
  \ the ground in mutual dejection. I couldn't believe I had just been discouraged\
  \ by a sister from going to Mass! Just like the beauty of the surrounding landscape\
  \ had sucker punched me, I felt like so had the sister. \nI've done a lot of bargaining\
  \ in my backpacking adventures, but never before had I bargained with praying. And\
  \ it seemed like for once my bargaining wasn't going to be enough. \n\nSuddenly\
  \ the front office door opened and the sister, still as stone faced as ever barked\
  \ something at the children in French, they turned to us with eyes full of suprised\
  \ glee. \n\n\"She says you can stay!' the girl replied.\n\"What made her change\
  \ her mind?\" I asked.\n\nThe boy just shrugged his shoulders with the world weariness\
  \ of a seasoned travel pro, \"This is Africa. Nothing ever makes sense.\"\n\nThat's\
  \ why I love it."
