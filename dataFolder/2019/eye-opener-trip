Text: "An invitation in the area of Barcelona in early September sounds always good.\
  \ It was not my first time there so all I did before starting the trip (in those\
  \ times without owning a smartphone) was to note down the exact name of the station\
  \ where I should get off the train and of the hostel where I was accommodated. I\
  \ genuinely thought I cannot be surprised but, man, I was so wrong! \nWhen I arrived\
  \ in Baixador de Vallvidrera, the closest station to my accommodation, I was alone\
  \ and it was already dark so I followed the signs towards the hostel. The road went\
  \ up, through some kind of forest (lately found out to be the heart of the Collserola\
  \ Park) and I suddenly heard something in the bushes. I took a deep breath and continued,\
  \ thinking that my imagination is already creating some monsters. A wild boar jumped\
  \ in front of me. It was real. I tried to remember if they get aggressive and how\
  \ could I confront one but I could not remember any useful information. Another\
  \ one came from behind. I thought that it was not going to end well but lucky enough\
  \ I saw a building with the name of the hostel on it. \"Phew!\" Behind the counter\
  \ a man looked at me and said: \"The wild boars! They're not aggressive. They're\
  \ protected in this area\". And while he was turning around mumbling over his shoulder\
  \ that the rooms are in another building on the same road, I saw he only had his\
  \ left arm. \"Ooooook, sure\", I said without believing it. It took me some moments\
  \ to gather the courage and open the door again. I tried to run up the stone stairs,\
  \ but my luggage was quite heavy. More wild boars showed their tiny sparkling curious\
  \ eyes in the dark and I was really considering going back to the train station.\
  \ Arriving at the second building, I almost had no breath. All the people working\
  \ there had either no arms or no legs and I could only see a reason for that: the\
  \ so-called non-agressive wild boars. \nBut I found out that INOUT Hostel belongs\
  \ to Icaria Iniciatives Socials, a non-profit organization whose mission is the\
  \ social and employment inclusion of people with disabilities, who make up the workforce\
  \ of professionals working there. 90% of the workforce is made up of people with\
  \ disabilities. My limits, designed in a not so inclusive society made me chose\
  \ as real the story in which the wild boars attacked a whole village but consider\
  \ impossible a social initiative. \nAt the beginning of the trip, I did not expect\
  \ to find another understanding of eclectic Barcelona except the amazing cultural\
  \ mix, but yet I did."
