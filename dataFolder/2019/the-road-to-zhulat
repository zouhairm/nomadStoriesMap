Text: "\u201CWhen a baby boy is born here, the father put a gun by its head, so he\
  \ will become tough like gun.\u201D \n\nWe were two days into our trip, and it was\
  \ increasingly difficult to react to these anecdotes, which our Albanian tour guide\
  \ recounted the way I might talk about my ninth birthday party at Chuck-e-Cheese.\n\
  Enrik is twenty-five, an Albanian native with a fierce pride for his country and\
  \ the mentality that accompanies it.  We had deviated from our itinerary to spend\
  \ a day in the village where he grew up, Zhulat. There is only one road there, unpaved,\
  \ and we bobbed up and down as he drove.\n\nHe was smoking, again, despite my pleas\
  \ not to. So I shifted my body behind the passenger seat where my husband Josh sat,\
  \ browsing through Enrik's extensive collection of Albanian rap. \n\nI wanted to\
  \ like him, but from our first meeting I found Enrik rude and abrasive. I was alarmed\
  \ when he called everyone poor a gypsy, or explained his life mantra as \"an eye\
  \ for an eye.\" He asked, irritated, why I was late everyday, and compared our life\
  \ in New York City to his cigarettes - crammed tightly into a small carton. He demanded\
  \ Josh sit up front next to him, while I sat in the back. I\u2019m used to guides\
  \ being overly kind;  too agreeable. While I instantly liked Albania, I wasn\u2019\
  t sure I liked Enrik at all, and I was certain he was no fine of mine. \n\nWe arrived\
  \ at the cottage where generations of his family were born, and the setting of his\
  \ stories came to life. He walked us through the backyard, full of pomegranate,\
  \ date, and quince trees. \u201CUnder that tree,\u201D Enrik told us, pointing,\
  \ \u201CI read Tom Sawyer and eat fresh figs as boy.\u201D We picked some ripe figs\
  \ and sat for a moment in silence, savoring their sweet, fleshy interior. \n\nThe\
  \ wife of Enrik\u2019s best friend, Dalmat, had cooked lunch and set a table outside\
  \ overlooking the mountains. Everything they served came from the village. The tomatoes\
  \ and eggplant were picked from the yard, the potatoes came from the field and fried\
  \ in the olive oil made that fall. The wine made from grapes hanging on the trellis\
  \ outside. He took such pride in his country's farm-to-table cuisine that he wouldn't\
  \ let us eat anything that wasn't fresh that whole week. I tried to order a hot\
  \ chocolate one evening, and he scolded me: \"This is not jungle - we not have chocolate\
  \ trees!\"\n\nOur lunch conversation was basic Albanian banter: Dalmat told us about\
  \ the monolithic village he discovered in the hills one day and five-hundred year\
  \ old a sheath he found there. I\u2019d never seen my husband so envious; his boyhood\
  \ fantasy someone else\u2019s reality. \n\nIt was just me and the men. Dalmat's\
  \ wife had cooked but was not invited to join. The gender gap in Albania is one\
  \ of the worst in the world; the World Economic Forum ranks Albania dead last in\
  \ Europe for Women's Health, rights, and land use. \"She not speak English,\" he\
  \ replied when I asked why she wasn't sitting with us. I took another scoop of potatoes,\
  \ letting out a loud, delicious, sigh for her to hear. \n\nTo share a meal with\
  \ someone in their home is intimate. They are letting you into their world; sharing\
  \ the small details of their existence. You see the photos they\u2019ve hung on\
  \ the walls, the print they chose for their curtains. You see their beginning; and\
  \ you begin to understand them better. \n\nWhen we travel, we can't expect people\
  \ to adapt to our mindset and accept our norms; it's our job. We are ones who have\
  \ to make the effort to see the world through the eyes of the people we are trying\
  \ to learn about. I realized that Enrik had never encountered anyone like me before;\
  \ a dominate, strong, opinionated woman. I wasn't just along for the ride; I wanted\
  \ the front seat. \n\nThere in Zhulat, I was able to appreciate Enrik for being\
  \ just like his country that I had come to love; real and raw; un-westernized, and\
  \ new to tourists."
