Text: "2 years ago i decided to take a leap of faith; faith in myself in my abilities\
  \ and potential.\nI left everything i had back home to move to Germany.\nWhen i\
  \ moved to Freiburg i had no idea what was waiting for me in this strange world.\n\
  I had never been to Germany before and it wasn\u2019t really on my bucket list.\n\
  I mostly prefer to visit places where the sun shines and people smile constantly.\n\
  Student life in Germany is not easy especially when you spend 96% of your time in\
  \ a library studying but after living here for 2 years it\u2019s almost time for\
  \ me to start a new adventure.\nI can definitely say that being a graduate student\
  \ wasn\u2019t easy but I met some amazing people in this place i even had funny\
  \ moments in the library.\nIf those books around us can talk they would say that\
  \ they bare witness to a lot of things those late nights spent studying the weekends\
  \ that were only enjoyed after another study session; those books were the only\
  \ witnesses to our hard work, they saw us laugh at silly things just because we\
  \ needed laughing they my 30 seconds dance party celebrations after nailing a hard\
  \ equation.\nThose books also bare witness to all the tears we had in this room\
  \ both sad and happy tears.\nIf only those books could talk they would tell you\
  \ all about the life long memories we all had here"
