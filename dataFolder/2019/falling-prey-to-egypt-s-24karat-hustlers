Text: "I arrived in Egypt excited to see the pyramids, temples, tombs and mummies;\
  \ I had no idea that I'd find some of the World's finest hustlers too.\n\nOn Day\
  \ 1, we visited the Giza pyramids. Our tour guide gave us the history lesson, options\
  \ on things to do and some free time to roam. I decided to climb inside the Great\
  \ pyramid and once I got out, my eyes wandered through the huge crowds hoping to\
  \ locate my group. Apparently, the slightly lost look I had on my face is exactly\
  \ the type of look young \"Ahmed\" is trained to detect. Out of nowhere, he approached\
  \ me and said \"Need help? Don't worry, I work here.\"\n\nI believed him. But I\
  \ didn't. But it didn't really matter. Not until he offered to show me the best\
  \ spots to take pictures with the Great Pyramid! He obviously read my mind! Or my\
  \ face.\n\nSo, I agreed to have him capture those angles, and yes I intended to\
  \ tip him. But the next thing I know, I was wearing a headscarf and sitting on top\
  \ of a camel, even though I repeatedly refused to. I promise you, I still have no\
  \ idea how I ended up on top of that camel. It's like once you agree to get 1 product/service,\
  \ you are automatically coaxed into taking 2 or 3 more.\n\nBut it gets worse. Little\
  \ did I know, I was a team project; and Ahmed had invited his co-workers to collaborate.\
  \ It's nice to see people working together, but certainly not at my expense. One\
  \ guy identified himself as the camel owner; while the other guy played the useless\
  \ role of pose-director. Once I had gotten enough of the mediocre pose ideas, the\
  \ unprofessional photos, and the \"wtf did I get myself into\" thoughts, I asked\
  \ to end the session.\n\nThen came the demand for money.\n\nSuddenly, I was surrounded\
  \ by 3 Egyptian men, though I had only contracted one. The camel owner said \"Just\
  \ give something, some people give $60, some give $80\". That's when I realized\
  \ my pockets were about to be murdered. It was evident that I'd have to pay for\
  \ the photos, the photographer, the headscarf, the camel, the pose director, the\
  \ pose ideas and apparently the pyramids too!\n\nI paused for a moment and hoped\
  \ the \"tourism police\" would hear my silent cry for help or our tour guide would\
  \ do his usual head-count and realize that he's missing one. But it turned out I\
  \ was on my own. I pulled out a $20, and at his demand, another...and another. Once\
  \ I realized I had paid enough for each guy to get $20, I shouted \"that's it\"\
  \ and attempted to drag my phone from Ahmed's hand; but my phone was being held\
  \ hostage.\n\nAt this point, I wasn't sure whether I wanted to cry, punch all three\
  \ men, or scream at the top of my lungs.\nBut I did neither. Instead, I yielded\
  \ to the request for $20 more then said \"No more!\" Ahmed, with a semi-satisfied\
  \ look on his face, said \"Okay, that's for camel; now you pay me for photos.\"\
  \ I was so close to telling him to keep the phone and all the expensive photos he\
  \ just took. But with a heavy heart and watering eyes, I handed him 200 Egyptian\
  \ pounds, grabbed my phone and ran!\n\nBut they began to chase me.\n\nI had just\
  \ given them a whole month's salary in under 10 minutes; what else could they want?!\
  \ Well, it appeared they were finally satisfied and were chasing me to ensure that\
  \ I was too. How could I be? I ignored them and kept speed-walking as they shouted\
  \ \"Are you happy?\" while trying to hand me 'good luck scarabs'. As I approached\
  \ the crowds, they disappeared and I started to wonder what if I had said \"No I'm\
  \ not happy\"? Would they give me my money back? Were they scared that I\u2019d\
  \ report them? Anyway, I had used up all my curiosity for the day, so I just kept\
  \ walking.\n\nAt the very least, these 24Karat hustlers in Egypt have groomed me\
  \ to take on hustlers anywhere in the world!"
