Text: "Here\u2019s an embarrassing confession: I\u2019m 20 years old and as wanderlust-y\
  \ as they come. Like others of my ilk, I constantly talk about escaping from the\
  \ city I live in; I\u2019ll romanticise trains over flights, local experiences over\
  \ hotel stays, and will frequently remind my mother that I\u2019m going to spend\
  \ all my money on travel. She doesn\u2019t need to say it, but I\u2019m sure she\
  \ thinks that I\u2019m a complete wannabe.\n\nAs someone who\u2019s about to dispense\
  \ some profound awakenings as a traveller, let me get a basic warning out of the\
  \ way: I haven\u2019t travelled a lot. But in an age when opinions and travel tickets\
  \ are sold by the dozen, I don\u2019t think that should stop me.\n\nSo with a few\
  \ half-forgotten trips as research, I\u2019m here to assert that the third day of\
  \ any trip is the best day. I know what you\u2019re thinking, \u201CBut dude, what\
  \ about that euphoric, heady, and thrilling first day?\u201D You have a point, dear\
  \ reader. The first day is indeed the day with the most excitement: You commemorate\
  \ it with 500 Instagram stories, intellectualise a disinterested pigeon with a caption\
  \ from Rumi. You gulp down as much food as possible and wear your best outfit.\n\
  \nBut amid the hysteria, you\u2019ve also forgotten the other side of this glorious\
  \ first day. The sheer exhaustion from dealing with cab-drivers, umpteen security\
  \ checks, annoying co-passengers, nosy tour guides, GPS miscalculations and, utter\
  \ confusion? As I\u2019ve noticed on most trips, the first day follows a predictable\
  \ pattern: I end up at a few overcrowded tourist-y places after paying double the\
  \ amount in rickshaw fare. And cap off the evening with a generic pizza dinner,\
  \ because who has yet had the time to know what local food actually is?\n\nThe second\
  \ day starts off only slightly better. On the bright side, you\u2019ve had a good\
  \ night\u2019s sleep and on the other hand, you stumble out of your hotel at noon\
  \ despite confidently making a \u201Cwaking up at 6 am to watch the sunrise\u201D\
  \ plan. When I visited Mumbai recently, one of my most most vivid memories from\
  \ the trip was the absolute cluelessness of the second day. I held up ten disgruntled\
  \ people in a line when I struggled to understand that a fast train won\u2019t stop\
  \ at Santa Cruz. I naively thought that \u201Cpudhe\u201D was the name of the station\
  \ when the announcer blared \u201CPudhe station Matunga aahe\u201D and missed my\
  \ stop. Like a true millennial, I even read up on the 10 best places to have local\
  \ food, but by the time I reached even one of them, lunch had already ended. Then,\
  \ determined to make up for the previous day\u2019s laziness, I committed the grave\
  \ mistake of non-stop sightseeing in the afternoon sun. Naturally, by the time the\
  \ sky was a beautiful blue and the weather a bit pleasant, I was already back at\
  \ my hotel, exhausted.\n\nAnd then came the beautiful third day of my vacation.\n\
  \nBy then, I was already hardened and humbled by my stupidity. Naturally, I was\
  \ better equipped to deal with the restlessness of the locals. I even jumped on\
  \ to the local before it had completely come to a halt and leaned out of the door\
  \ to feel the wind in my face as Bollywood has instructed me to. Okay, I didn\u2019\
  t, but I did stand close to the door. On that day, I remember walking on the roads\
  \ without aggressively clutching my bag or reaching for my camera every 10 minutes.\
  \ I entered a breakfast cafe like it\u2019s a childhood favourite. I swaggered around\
  \ the city in my tired feet, truly seeing it for the first time. I sat at rooftop\
  \ restaurant by the sea and spent a whole afternoon staring at the ebbing waves.\n\
  \nIt wasn\u2019t like the city changed overnight: It was still overcrowded, confusing,\
  \ and slightly foul smelling. But after two days of a hurried vacation, I\u2019\
  d mellowed down. The third day of the vacation forces you to rethink your priorities\
  \ and do what you\u2019d intended to do in the first place: see a city. That day,\
  \ I felt like a traveller, even though I was still a tourist."
