Text: "When I first stepped in Australia, I knew by the accent I heard from the locals\
  \ that it was going to be an amazing adventure. I was obviously scared because,\
  \ after all, it was the first country I had gone abroad. That is why I would accept\
  \ any new experience people would offer to me.\nDo you have any of those dreams\
  \ that you ever wanted to accomplish but always thought they would never happen?\
  \ Well, for me, skydiving was one of those. Jumping out of a plane? That sounded\
  \ like a step straight to death and even though I wanted to do it. Until the day\
  \ a new friend invited me to actually go skydiving. Without a doubt, I said \u201C\
  yes\u201D and, from that exact moment, my heart started beating so fast that I could\
  \ hear it. \nSo, I decided that I wanted to die my hair to pink, because I wanted\
  \ to look like a cotton candy in the air (does it make any sense to you?). Since\
  \ I was jumping into the unknown, I mean, who knows if I would be alive after that,\
  \ I wanted to have a nice appearing in between the clouds. So we did it and it went\
  \ so wrong! Every curl of my hair got a different colour, from the white the bleach\
  \ had created to the supposedly pink, that turned into a very strange type of orange.\
  \ \nThen, the big day had arrived: my friend and took a bus to Byron Bay and we\
  \ went to our great exploit: I couldn\u2019t even enjoy all the beautiful trees\
  \ that were surrounding the road, because my hands were shaking and sweating. \n\
  When we arrived to the place, I noticed that the plane that was taking everyone\
  \ to \u201Cheaven\u201D had a Mexican skull drew on it. \u201CThat\u2019s a nice\
  \ way to let me feel safe\u201D, I thought. They had a few lines before my turn,\
  \ so I kept watching everyone who were jumping: they looked scared before going\
  \ into the plane and after jumping they looked just amazed. I couldn\u2019t describe\
  \ how big they were smiling and how happy they seemed. My mind knew it was going\
  \ to be awesome, but my heart wouldn\u2019t agree. \nBefore our skydiving, we had\
  \ a small training. Then, I was ready to get inside the plane when I met the guy\
  \ who would fly attached to me. I don\u2019t remember his name, but he was crazy!\
  \ With his GoPro, he kept filming the pineapple tattoo I have on my left arm. He\
  \ made me the first to get into the plane. It was shaking so much! I flew to the\
  \ middle of the ocean and by that point I was terrified. I don\u2019t remember how\
  \ long we spent flying, but I do recall when they opened the plane\u2019s door.\
  \ The wind that came from the outside was so strong and\u2026 oh my God! The first\
  \ pair jumped so fast and the others went after them, until it was my turn \u2013\
  \ since I was the first to get in, I was the last to jump. My instructor gave me\
  \ a little tap on my right shoulder, so I could lay my head on his, as they had\
  \ taught and straightened my legs. And we jumped. I can still feel my heart jumping\
  \ out of my chest and the 100 miles per hour or the wind coming straight to my face.\
  \ I felt like a dog having a good time at some car\u2019s window. I had 60 seconds\
  \ of free fall and I tried to use the time to admire the view. It was so beautiful!\
  \ I felt so thrilled and I loved the feeling. So, the parachute was opened smoothly\
  \ and I wanted that moment to never be ended. As soon as I landed, I could feel\
  \ the same smile I saw in everyone else\u2019s face: I\u2019ve never felt so alive!\
  \ And isn\u2019t it what Mexican skulls mean? Eternal life! I can feel the shaking\
  \ of my hands, the wind on my cheeks and the big smiling coming on my face: this\
  \ sensation will never go away: the day I jumped out of a plane and loved it."
