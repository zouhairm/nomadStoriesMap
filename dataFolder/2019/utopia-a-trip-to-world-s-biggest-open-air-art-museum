Text: "Have you ever felt as if you were stepping into a magical realm?  Deep in the\
  \ countryside of South America lay a pleasure focused garden, a breathtaking art\
  \ museum costing hundreds of millions to develop and millions to maintain. It really\
  \ blew my mind when i first arrived, Inhotim brings joy and controversy to this\
  \ rural part of Brazil. Inhotim was Built by a steel mogul who later in life pled\
  \ guilty on charges of money laundering and tax evasion, I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ feel enchanted and curious\n\n At  the entrance you are  provided with a map,\
  \ consisting of different color routes with  suggested paths to the many exhibitions,\
  \ lounges, gardens, restaurants, and bars, An optional golf cart pass can be purchased,\
  \ but I chose to go by foot . Walking has always been a favorite pastime of mine\
  \ and I felt that in this manner I could more closely  observe all the details that\
  \ made up this enlightening experience. Inhotim immense layout makes it nearly impossible\
  \ to get to know everything in a single day even with the cart pass. Most of the\
  \ visitors plan two or three days there. \n\nWhile I immersed myself for two days\
  \ inside of the  the tropical landscapes, which were carefully designed with marble\
  \ paths and rare exotic flowers, with flying bright blue butterflies, I almost felt\
  \ like I was one with the nature that surrounded me. While amidst this connection\
  \ i began to take in the architecture.  Each gallery is a unique experience connected\
  \ to the exhibit key topic . Building styles goes from concrete bunkers and industrial\
  \ tents to tropical prefabricated houses and round glass rooms. For open air lovers,\
  \ there are plenty of sculptures and installations, including a swimming pool for\
  \ refreshing while appreciating the mountain views. \n\nAt each step I was finding\
  \ galleries where more than just appreciating art, I could enter It . Whatever the\
  \ artists were trying to show: Mysticism, pain, dream, curiosity, danger, strength...I\
  \ felt it all, in my body, in my bones and brain. Inhotim it\u2019s an immersive,\
  \ psychoactive experience that you can hardly face without being transformed by\
  \ it.  \n\nLaying on tree shaped benches, taking a break between the mind blowing\
  \ exhibitions, I felt as if the entire human kind deserved to live in a place like\
  \ this or at least share in this experience. Why beauty and leisure are not fully\
  \ available? Why so many people have to suffer so much in their lives while a few\
  \ accumulate a fortune that they don\u2019t need? \n\nMy brain kept going round\
  \ and round on questions I don\u2019t have an answer but that are worth thinking\
  \ about. Partially instigated by the works of art, partially confronted with the\
  \ reality of that place and the extremely unequal economy we have in Brazil and\
  \ other parts of the world. It was a surprise that my relaxing vacation brought\
  \ so many intense, and somewhere, uncomfortable feelings while making me feel alive\
  \ and grateful for the opportunity of getting to know such unique place. \n\nUnfortunately,\
  \ Brumadinho was recently victim of a tragedy related to an environmental crime.\
  \ Hundreds of people killed and houses destroyed in January this year after a dam\
  \ collapsed. A disaster caused by the neglecting of the mining company in charge,\
  \ bringing despair to the city and neighbouring communities, and devastating an\
  \ entire river ecosystem. A visit to Inhotim, is more important than ever. They\
  \ are the biggest local employer and needs its visitors, to keep the city alive,\
  \ and help it recover from the ocean of mud it got recently reached with. \n\nDespite\
  \ its hardships, crises, and the dangers of the nature exploitation, denounced in\
  \ many of the exhibits there, Inhotim brings this controversial utopia of a place\
  \ where the dreams come true and art is all there is, while exploring humankind\
  \ traits and our impact on earth."
