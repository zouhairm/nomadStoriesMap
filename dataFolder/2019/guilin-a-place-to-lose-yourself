Text: "In southern part of China exists a beautiful green city called Guilin that\
  \ has a magnificent landscape of karst hills of various shapes. It was last winter\
  \ when my husband and I decided to explore this city. Covering itself with the foggy\
  \ sky, the city offered us many touristy spots where one can make life time memories.\
  \ \nWe stayed in a hotel near the famous tourist attraction of the city called Reed\
  \ Flute Cave which is about 5kms downtown to Guilin city centre. The cave has stunning\
  \ stalactites, stone pillars and rock formations with a history of existence around\
  \ 700,000 years. Various stalagmites are present and named according to their resemblance\
  \ like the Tower-shaped Pine, Crystal Palace, etc. They are highlighted brilliantly\
  \ with colorful lights. As we go around the city, one can view many karst hills\
  \ like the Elephant Trunk Hill, Folded Brocade Hill, Seven-Star Park, Solitary Beauty\
  \ Peak. Yes, there are many hills around this city enriching it with greenery. Other\
  \ main attractions are Sun Pagoda and Moon Pagoda at Shanhu Lake (a must see in\
  \ the night), Zhengyang pedestrian street, Daxu Ancient town, Jingjiang Princes\u2019\
  \ Palace.\nNext day, we decided to ride over the Li River which flows from the city\
  \ to nearby place, Yangshuo. We went on a bamboo raft ride from the Zhujiang Wharf\
  \ (Bamboo River Wharf) on a cold morning (around 8 degrees). I can never forget\
  \ that magical feel when we were in the middle of the river amidst the hills with\
  \ cold breeze around us, fresh clouds in the sky and mild sunshine sparkling over\
  \ the river. This was truly the best feel where I lost myself! Alternatively, one\
  \ can choose the cruise from Mopanshan Wharf (Millstone Hill Wharf) that rides over\
  \ the river. However, the route is shorter on the bamboo raft ride (1 hour contrary\
  \ to the 4 hours cruise ride) from Yangdi village to Nine Horse Fresco/Mural Hill\
  \ (which can be viewed in the river; owing its name to a legendary story about nine\
  \ horses raised in heaven) to Xingping Village. The traditional Bamboo rafting gives\
  \ a unique experience. We then arrived at Xingping village, which is now grown into\
  \ Xingping town of which the old center is commercialized with local businesses\
  \ for tourist attraction. About 30 minutes from there, we visited a scenic spot\
  \ which is imprinted on the 20 RMB note of the Chinese currency. \nThe following\
  \ day, we headed to Dragon\u2019s Backbone Rice Terraces which is located in Longsheng\
  \ County. We rode on local buses and had the pleasure of viewing the countryside\
  \ lifestyle. The rice terrace is situated between 300-1100 meters and covers about\
  \ 66 square kilometers. As we got down the bus, we were welcomed by a woman from\
  \ the local minority ethnic group called Yao (many such women welcome tourists who\
  \ go there). She was dressed in a typical ethnic black colored wear with her long\
  \ hair wrapped as a bun. She took us to her place and offered food. Of course, she\
  \ charged us. They make their living, by providing food and accommodation. Her house\
  \ was very typical as the rest of the community, made of bamboo. She made vegetarian\
  \ food (bamboo rice and vegetable soup) on our request (vegetables were hand-picked\
  \ from her own cultivation land).\nWe then decided to hike on foot to one of the\
  \ view point called Golden Buddha Peak. Not to forget, the rice terrace is spread\
  \ across many villages in the vicinity- Longji Village, Ping'an Village, Zhongliu\
  \ Village, Dazhai Village, Tiantou Village, Xiaozhai Village, etc. We chose Golden\
  \ Buddha peak for its cable car transport. The adventurous hike was worth the view!\
  \ It was almost evening when we reached the peak and the view of rice terraces was\
  \ truly splendid to watch the sun set. We came down the peak through cable car.\
  \ \nUniqueness here is that one can watch ethnic minority women from the Huangluo\
  \ Yao village (the Red Yao village) carry on their traditional hair-combing performance\
  \ and song and dance everyday (every women is said to have over 1m of hair on average\
  \ (This tradition has earned recognition from Guinness World records). \nI bet you\
  \ too will lose yourself in this marvelous little heaven!"
