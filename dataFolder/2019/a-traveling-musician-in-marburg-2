Text: "The smartest thing you can have in the working musician game is a booker. I\
  \ don\u2019t have a booker \u2014 not being particularly smart, and, as such, I\
  \ find myself on a seven and a half hour journey to Germany\u2019s Herzland (heartland)\
  \ for a one-off show in a place I\u2019ve never heard of: Marburg.\n\nSteph joins\
  \ the journey to offer vocals and company, as we plunge into the depths of Deutschland,\
  \ transferring endless regional trains to avoid the high-end rail prices and to\
  \ add an extra sense of bewilderment to our expedition, all while dragging my hefty\
  \ guitar case. It is below freezing, our gig landing on the 1st of February, and\
  \ we\u2019re not entirely sure what our payment shall be \u2014 depending on how\
  \ many people show up on the night. So far, one person I know has clicked attending,\
  \ so we\u2019re quietly confident.\n\nWe arrive after an 8 hour and change journey,\
  \ thanks to a delay and horrendous coffee in a place called Kassel. (We didn\u2019\
  t get to see much of Kassel, but we learned the horrendous coffee we had there was\
  \ a \u201CKaffee Creme\u201D and certainly not an \u201CAmericano\u201D, as Steph\
  \ requested \u2014 which is good to know going forward.) Arriving in Marburg, the\
  \ day\u2019s already gone, and night firmly in place as we make our way through\
  \ the ancient city. \u201CNow, this is certainly somewhere\u201D \u2014 we agree,\
  \ stepping past the immense and ominously lit cathedral.\n\nWe arrive to our destination,\
  \ Q Bar, meet our local guide, sound-guy, and all around champ, Jochen, who points\
  \ us in the way of a fine pizza place \u2014 discussing along route how dairy ain\u2019\
  t good for vocals, but, how little we care when crippled with hunger pangs \u2014\
  \ having ill prepared for our lengthy journey.\n\nWith empty pizza boxes before\
  \ us, the once wide open venue, cathedral-like in its stone interior, and black\
  \ wooden roof, now utterly fills up. Who are these people? Middle-aged or older,\
  \ for the most part \u2014 sans Sofie and her friend, the only lady I knew who clicked\
  \ attending. There\u2019s a few younguns\u2019 lining the back, and I\u2019m suddenly\
  \ aware how prone to chatting to the crowd in English I\u2019ve become in between\
  \ songs, and how little they\u2019ll understand if that habit kicks in tonight.\n\
  \nThe show starts, goes well, and my guitar (who\u2019s been sick as a dog since\
  \ an onslaught of studio sessions) goes out of tune, often. Steph, who\u2019s versed\
  \ in the Deutsche tongue, offers up quips about how our guitar is a problem child,\
  \ and we power through. It goes as well as it can go, and the crowd are wonderful\
  \ in response to us \u2014 and, for once, financially speaking, these poor expat\
  \ Berliners, are on easy street for the eve and journey back with a little extra\
  \ dosh.\n\n\u201CStick around for the techo cave-rave, it will go on till seven\u201D\
  , said a well-wishing event organiser, who\u2019d rented out the back of the venue.\
  \ Leading our way through to inspect the cave \u2014 as you do without hesitation\
  \ as one must when ask to see a techno cave before (seldom after) the techno has\
  \ started, we walk along candle-lit stone to a cavern in the cave \u2014 where a\
  \ light-show\u2019s projected against the wall, and there\u2019s a DJ booth set\
  \ up. We\u2019re far too folky and exhausted from the journey to see it out, completely,\
  \ but stay, discussing Marburg with Sophie for a while \u2014 learning how buses\
  \ only come once an hour, and I aptly reminiscent for Ireland \u2014 where bus schedules\
  \ are so infrequent, the sight of a 61 toward the City Centre is tantamount to mythical.\
  \ With that we retire to our digs for the night: an old ballet school, with a spectacular\
  \ view over the the city. An air of spookiness exuded from the place, represented\
  \ here by Steph\u2019s tinkling on the piano.\n\n \n\nWhen awake we explore the\
  \ winding cobble streets and the various levels of this mountainous city. We sample\
  \ a Gl\xFChwein, while standing at the door of a cathedral as beautiful (and terrifying)\
  \ organ music blares out, and watch crows fly across slated roof-tops and out, over\
  \ the city \u2014 showing off the misted mountains in the background. Having been\
  \ knocked aside, taken aback and made marvel at the wondrous city, we stop off at\
  \ another cave, a tavern cut into the mountain and lined with locals perched at\
  \ the bar watching a Berlin v. Wolfsburg football match. We\u2019d love to stay,\
  \ but gotta take a train going to the former, with many more in-between.\n\nWe arrive\
  \ back in Berlin at midnight, exhausted but elated thanks to Marburg. Still have\
  \ no booker, still not sure I\u2019m smart enough of want one, yet."
