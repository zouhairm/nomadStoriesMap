Text: "Cycling out of cities are always the trickiest part, especially with no phone.\
  \ A hand-drawn map; \u2018keep left, past the second castle\u2019, were my navigational\
  \ instructions for the day.\u2026 worked splendidly.\n\nMy first challenge: a breathing-developing-road\
  \ block. I had received hints of what was to come by the sporadic display of feces\
  \ along the bike path. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what animal it had come from, I\
  \ was just hoping it wasn\u2019t the same Indochinese Leopard that had previously\
  \ attacked me in Thailand months before\u2026 Now wouldn\u2019t that be a headline?!\n\
  \n'Canadian Cyclist gets Mauled by a Leopard whilst Cycling in North Holland...\
  \ Again\u2026'\n\nor maybe,\n\n'Canadian Cyclist takes down the same Leopard that\
  \ previously mauled her in Thailand.'\n\nBut I was faced with a road block much\
  \ worse than any leopard:\n\nA Lazy Mob of Sheep\u2026\n\nI rang my bike bell, tried\
  \ to speak nice, tried raising my voice, tried waving my arms- nothing would get\
  \ these guys off the path. So, I got off my bike and took some photos of the area,\
  \ when I returned, they were all huddled; meddling around my bike bag. I had successfully\
  \ made it back on my bike, and pedalling in high gear, I had reluctantly become\
  \ part of \u201CThe Mob\u201D with twenty-five sheep running with me.\n\nThe next\
  \ challenge was a rather interesting one. Considering all of the signs on my path\
  \ were in Dutch, I could only recognize that I was headed towards some-sort of beach\
  \ area. It seemed rather secluded, so I thought it might be a good spot for a water-break.\
  \ I walked my bike over to the sandy area, and sat down. I leaned back and looked\
  \ around, and saw a lot more skin than I had expected\u2026 and suddenly, felt rather\
  \ \u2018over-dressed\u2019.\n\n-it was a quick water-break-\n\nNear the end of the\
  \ day, I had made it across the German border, and soon after, spotted a farm with\
  \ some fascinating cattle. They were jersey brown with a prominent white stripe\
  \ that encircled their entire midsection. I stood there by the fence, trying to\
  \ figure out how or why they had these bold stripes. It was just then when I noticed\
  \ a farmer beginning to approach me. He was an older man, in his mid 70s, wearing\
  \ a plaid flannel and nicely groomed grey hair, with a big smile across his face.\n\
  \n\u201CSch\xF6ne Rinder, nicht wahr?\u2019 he questioned.\n\n\u201CSorry! I don\u2019\
  t speak German well\u201D I responded.\n\n\u201CWell that\u2019s okay, because I\
  \ can speak English!\u201D he added.\n\nI asked him to explain a little bit about\
  \ his cattle. He went on to say that they were a Dutch breed, and when soldiers\
  \ would come from other countries during the war, they thought there was a sheet\
  \ actually laid across their midsections, and thus \u2018the Dutch Sheet Cattle\u2019\
  \ name came about. Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t very practical, in fact, he\
  \ only still had them because, \u2018\u2026the neighbours like to look at them\u2019\
  .\n\nThe venerable farmer was curious about my ride, though, he couldn\u2019t quite\
  \ get an answer out of me as to why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing. And that\
  \ is because, quite simply, I don\u2019t have one. \n\nJust, the ride.\n\nI didn\u2019\
  t expect to find myself in a sheep mob, nor did I expect my two legs to carry me\
  \ one thousand seven hundred kilometres away from my comfort zone. I\u2019m not\
  \ sure what the sheep saw in me, however their faint bleating sustained me in my\
  \ times of despair. From the first kilometres in Amsterdam, Netherlands to warmth\
  \ that was waiting for me in Gdansk, Poland. \n\nTime has passed, and in my quiet\
  \ moments, if I listen carefully, I can still feel their bleats carrying me onward.\n\
