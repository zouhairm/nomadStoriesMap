Text: "When I arrived at my Cuban casa particular(private homestay) after dark in\
  \ Havana, Mirtha was sitting outside on her steps waiting for me with a smile on\
  \ her face.\n\nWhen I struggled to lug my bags up the stairs to her 3rd-floor apartment,\
  \ she used all 70 years of her strength to help me out even though I asked her not.\n\
  \nWhen I couldn\u2019t understand her fast Spanish, she remained patient & slowed\
  \ her speech without giving up altogether.\n\nWhen I was in her presence, she would\
  \ lovingly force me to eat whichever food she had available at the moment - including\
  \ Ropa vieja, Arroz Congri, Arroz con Leche, Malanga, Yuca Frita, Maduros, Pan con\
  \ queso, Guayaba. I quickly discovered that this was a sign of endearment in Cuba.\n\
  \nWhen I told her I felt sick, vomiting 5 times in one day, she immediately rushed\
  \ out the door & returned with fresh bread, Malanga, activated charcoal, and hot\
  \ tea to make me feel better- no questions asked.\n\nWhen I asked her about bus\
  \ tickets, she spent 3 hours in the heat to accompany me to the bus station.\n\n\
  When I had no plans, she prompted me to join her in watching her favorite telenovelas.\n\
  \nWhen I said goodbye, she gifted me with a necklace made out of material that could\
  \ only be found in Cuba & a piece of her art because she loved art and she remembered\
  \ that I did too. \n\nSo what was the catch? I wondered the same but there wasn't\
  \ one.\n\nMirtha treated me as if I was her daughter, simply out of the kindness\
  \ of her heart. \n\nListening to her childhood tales, grocery shopping with her,\
  \ meeting her extended family members, quietly watching her cook, and simply being\
  \ in her presence gave me special insight into the life of a Cuban woman.\n\nAfter\
  \ a long day spent in the hectic streets of Havana, her quiet home was like a refuge\
  \ to return to. After visiting a foreign country so different than my own, her kindness\
  \ felt like home. My trip to Havana may have only lasted a week, but I know that\
  \ I'll be meeting Mirtha again."
