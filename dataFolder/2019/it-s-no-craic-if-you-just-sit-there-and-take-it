Text: "If there\u2019s something the Irish won\u2019t like, it\u2019s claiming you\
  \ can understand Ireland from the outside. You must do time to understand, a sentence\
  \ handed down at birth. Cassey and I arrived for our road trip with thoughtless\
  \ expectations of Guinness, singing, and a bit of the craic.\n\nThe postcard Irish\
  \ experience came courtesy of a crew of firefighters on a cycling tour from their\
  \ native Basque Country. First met at a karaoke night in Tralee where they brought\
  \ the house down with a baritone choir of YMCA booming from gladiator physiques\
  \ with enough power to pin the whole pub to the back of the room. Then passing their\
  \ pedalling formation en route to the Cliffs of Moher. We drove for ten minutes\
  \ then made a U turn, found them waiting for us at Gus O'Connor's Pub in Doolin.\
  \ \n\nThe regulars sang first, then a song of Basque independence rolled through\
  \ the room. The audience asked me to translate their praise. The Irish won\u2019\
  t praise everything. But when soul meets talent they praise with a wave of relief\
  \ that finally, something has earned it. The boys from the Basque Country had soul,\
  \ formed from their land, from the work stories they told us over pints, people\
  \ pulled from car wrecks, domestic disputes and flames, from whatever private trials\
  \ they kept to themselves. The soul, the singing, and the darkness outside. A thrilling\
  \ night for two tourists in Ireland. But not the most valuable. That trip I started\
  \ to understand that Guinness, singing, and a bit of the craic are tools for survival.\n\
  \nWe\u2019d arrived in Dublin wondering if our savings would last ten days. Greeted\
  \ with the news that thanks to a dodgy rental site we were down hundreds of euro,\
  \  and the closest available automatic was in Cork, our contingency plan was a bus\
  \ to Cassey\u2019s friends in Wexford and a welcome I didn\u2019t expect to find.\
  \ \n\nWe were offered a bed without question, food, drink, singing, craic. Then\
  \ the rest of the night, as a New Zealander living in Paris, I was mercilessly taken\
  \ apart in the vein of \u2018so only Paris is good enough for you, is it?\u2019\
  \ I sat there taking provocations sharp enough to wound and funny enough to be plausibly\
  \ deniable, even when our host Liam threw a beer at me, and hammered and yelled\
  \ incoherent insults through our bedroom door later that night. I had no frame of\
  \ reference for this social practice, but I understood it. The goal is to get a\
  \ reaction. The reaction reveals the character. The character identifies friend\
  \ or foe. Whether this is done consciously or subconsciously, the Irish have never\
  \ had the luxury of complacency. The darkness driving those tongues. In the midst\
  \ of this understanding I discovered a certain talent for ripping the piss myself.\
  \ It\u2019s no craic if you just sit there and take it. \n\nThis despite my terrible\
  \ inadequacy when faced with what I desire to be above all else: a good conversationalist.\
  \ I don\u2019t claim Ireland is a nation of preternatural linguists. You hear mundane\
  \ conversations, inarticulacy, but then, in the most ordinary settings, the most\
  \ irreproducible brilliance. I can never be as quick, as amusing, as tirelessly\
  \ loquacious as the average pub raconteur there. The skills that develop for survival\
  \ cannot be reproduced. And I\u2019ve never had to survive Ireland, a country that\
  \ forges soul like the earth forms diamond. \n\nIn the morning, I found Liam alone\
  \ in the kitchen. I was offered a warm tour of the town, shown the sites and treated\
  \ to breakfast by a perfect host. I knew I\u2019d handled things alright the night\
  \ before. A hidden talent for wearing a beer with good humour. \n\nI haven\u2019\
  t spoke of the landscapes, the sites begging for description or metaphor, because\
  \ I discovered Ireland through the ear. For my sins I have since acquired a long\
  \ term Irish partner who deconstructs me when I claim to understand anything about\
  \ his national psyche. But that first trip introduce me to a darkness I hadn\u2019\
  t expected to find and the brilliance that blooms because of it. Language as a weapon\
  \ and a torch against that darkness."
