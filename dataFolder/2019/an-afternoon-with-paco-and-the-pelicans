Text: "Paco is 26, with bunches of pyramidal hair and a slick smile. He lives in the\
  \ small town of Toubakouta, positioned on the southern banks of the Saloum Delta\
  \ in Senegal. It's Coolio, I thought to myself, jokingly. Boune, who was an independent\
  \ tour operator, introduced me to him and Paco was going to be my guide for the\
  \ afternoon.\n\nI had already abandoned the idea of waiting to join a tour at one\
  \ of the two lodges in town. Instead, I decided to make a reconnaissance of  Toubakouta's\
  \ main thoroughfare. A banner on a modestly decorated building read 'Traiteur Les\
  \ Loisirs Du Saloum' over a paneless window-aperture. I swiftly looked up the translation\
  \ which read, 'Catering for the leisure of Saloum'. Perfect, I thought and proceeded\
  \ into the premises.\n\nThe two chaps had been organising trips around the Saloum\
  \ Delta for years. On getting to know them, I felt completely at ease in their company.\
  \ Their broken English and my almost non-existent French was enough to build trust\
  \ and understanding.\n\nI had spent the entire morning getting to Toubakouta from\
  \ the coastal town of Saly, approximately 50 kilometers from Dakar. \"Why Toubakouta?\"\
  , asked one local, in French, in a shared taxi en route. \"Birds and baobabs\",\
  \ I reposted. This was before preparing myself to impersonate a bird in a vehicle\
  \ crammed full of seven sizeable locals. Fortunately for me the local nodded with\
  \ a smile and asked nothing more.\n\nBesides working with Boune, Paco made his living\
  \ from flogging African masks. His premises was one of a small line of sheds on\
  \ an earth road. It lay equidistant from two of the largest lodges in Toubakouta;\
  \ Les Pal\xE9tuviers and Keur Saloum. He was eager to get my custom during my stay\
  \ but never persisted like some other vendors. I respected him for this and imagined\
  \ that he wanted to cultivate something more meaningful than just a quick sale.\n\
  \nMy trip with Paco began by availing a motorboat with young boatman on the riverbank\
  \ of Toubakouta. He can't have been any older than 16 years old and had a quiet,\
  \ calm and collected presence. Before long we were skimming past green vervet monkeys\
  \ dallying about on the shore of the mangroves. Baobabs punctuated the skyline of\
  \ the park in the yonder. At last \u2014 baobabs, I thought. After 10 short minutes\
  \ Paco and I were in the middle of the widest point of the delta. The park covers\
  \ an area roughly the size of Sao Paulo. Sitting in such a small vessel gave me\
  \ a real sense of its magnitude. There was at least a kilometer between us and the\
  \ nearest patch of land. It gave me the feeling of freedom and serenity. The smell\
  \ of Paco's cigarette smoke gently wafted past my nose from time to time. It was\
  \ the only intrusion to my day among the static, yet clean air around us.\n\nThe\
  \ afternoon on the boat was enriched by sights and sounds in all directions. Paco\
  \ pointed out the pelicans returning home for the night before the sun dropped behind\
  \ the canopy. The sky turned orange, then crimson before the last bit of light.\
  \ We remained stationary in the boat as we saw the silhouette of trees against the\
  \ dimming sky. He showed me how to crack open a baobab and eat its contents for\
  \ a source of sugar. He took me to a part of the park where you could hear hundreds\
  \ of cattle egrets in the mangroves. What I remember most about Paco though, was\
  \ his vast knowledge of not only his country, but West Africa. He invited me to\
  \ drink with him that very night and recited volubly, daily life of the people from\
  \ Bissau. He told me about how they love to party and encouraged me to go with him\
  \ one day. He opened my eyes to a land I knew little about besides West African\
  \ birds. He colored my perspective not just by the country's flora, but explained\
  \ the daily lifestyle of working class citizens. Paco was one of them."
