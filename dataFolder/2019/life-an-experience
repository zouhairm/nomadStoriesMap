Text: "Hi there, \nAs you all know that India is a great place to visit and experience\
  \ all the beauty of the monument such as taj mahal, red fort, etc. This land was\
  \ called as the land of gold. Not only the monuments and the beauty but the people\
  \ around here is friendly as well. We learn how to get mature, as time pass we grow\
  \ older but this scenic view cannot get old. Love at first sight is the perfect\
  \ example for such views. India is mostly popular for the spices, nature etc.\n\
  Most of the times you can see that people from various culture stay here together.\
  \ They have diversity among them. No matter what hardwork prooves to be the great\
  \ power booster in people around here. Country is developing and yet many more things\
  \ to come. But for sure one will experience and love the ambiance around the place.\n\
  \nNorth India, North East India then the South Costal line of India and the Western\
  \ part of country with busy streets and cities will make you think that from one\
  \ end to other end of the country there are differences.\n\nIndia is cheap in travelling.\
  \ Click pictures and enjoy the surrounding. Forget about worries mixup with the\
  \ people talk to them and enjoy."
