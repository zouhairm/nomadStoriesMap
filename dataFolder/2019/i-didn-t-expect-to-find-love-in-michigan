Text: "I would like to think of myself as an adventurous person. \nI believe the eight\
  \ states I have traveled to, the seven curious scars on my body, and the many memories\
  \ I have accumulated over my travels are more than enough evidence to validate such\
  \ an opinion. Despite the fact that I cannot name even half of the fifty states\
  \ in America, or accurately locate them on a map, traveling is something that has\
  \ always caused my concentration to be overcome with covetousness. So when my best\
  \ friend asked me to join her on a journey to visit her family in Michigan, I was\
  \ more than up to the task.\nMichigan in October.\nProbably not the best time to\
  \ visit a northern state, but the rainbow of trees we witnessed as we drove through\
  \ the state was an encouraging and uplifting sight. Not to mention that Michigan\
  \ has some of the best apples I have ever tasted. We went to an orchard/ pumpkin\
  \ patch with her little sister while we visited and the honeycrisp apples were almost\
  \ too large for my palm, and vibrant in color, their taste sweet and their texture\
  \ as perfectly crunchy as the name suggests. \nYes, the wind was a frigid frost-monster\
  \ that lashed out at us every chance it had and, yes, it did smell like fish in\
  \ the air most of the time because of all the mist from the nearby lakes. \nBut\
  \ the love that I found there? \nIt was more than enough to overcome such trivial\
  \ nuisances. And it will no doubt have me returning to Michigan sometime in the\
  \ near future. \nWe drove all through the night from Kentucky to Michigan, figuring\
  \ that night-driving would be quicker and preferable to daytime traffic, and knowing\
  \ that we could overload our twenty-two-year-old bodies on caffeine for the duration\
  \ of the journey and simply crash once the adventure was done. Upon arriving to\
  \ our destination, we promptly collapsed into bed, and slept until halfway through\
  \ the next day. \nIt was no surprise that I woke up to a violent growling in my\
  \ stomach, its vicious threats enough to wake even the heaviest of sleepers. We\
  \ needed coffee. We needed sustenance. And we needed it immediately. \nAs my best\
  \ friend was getting ready in the restroom, I looked up nearby places to eat, hoping\
  \ for something small and local, something we could not find back home. It did not\
  \ take me long at all to locate a restaurant named Randy's Diner. \nI'm a sucker\
  \ for a good cup o' joe. Randy's certainly won me out with that right away as our\
  \ waitress walked straight up with a pot of coffee. I guess we looked like we needed\
  \ it. \nWe perused the menu. My friend got something with cinnamon, because I hate\
  \ the flavor and she knew I wouldn't dare encroach on her territory by asking to\
  \ try it. I got something with a side of potatoes, because I don't believe in eating\
  \ meals that don't involve potatoes. \nWe sipped on our coffees, enjoying the fifty's\
  \ feel of the diner, the checkered patterns, the vinyl booths. Everyone seemed to\
  \ know everyone there. It was very home-y, warm. \nAnd then it happened. \nJust\
  \ as the waitress was bringing our plates to the table, it happened, and I knew.\
  \ Love at first sight. \nI knew I would never find a love like that back home. It\
  \ stole my breath away. \nThe waffle was gorgeous, in all its golden glory, decorated\
  \ with fresh-cut strawberries and spurts of whipped cream. It was nearly too large\
  \ for the plate. Not just any waffle. This was a malt waffle. Its texture was light\
  \ and fluffy, but somehow just the right amount of firm as I chased it with a glass\
  \ of chilled milk. \nHonestly, I might have cried a little.\nWe returned for breakfast\
  \ at Randy's every following day of our trip.\nI think of that waffle entirely too\
  \ often. \nAnd I know, in my heart, that I'll never find a love like that again."
