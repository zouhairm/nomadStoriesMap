Text: "Some humans think Amsterdam is all about canals and London is only Big Ben.\
  \ I must have thought that too sometime\u2026 until I saw him. He made me believe\
  \ in the magic of being in two places at the same time. And now when I travel I\
  \ leave the beaten track, just to find him again. \n\nYou\u2019ll never know his\
  \ name, only where he inhabits, except he has one soul and two bodies. One lives\
  \ in\u2026 \n\nAmsterdam was sleeping when I got there and wandering through the\
  \ streets felt like trying to walk through a room without waking a baby. Except\
  \ the Jordaan is always crackling. Constantly changing. Just happening. That arty\
  \ corner of the globe contains the oldest pubs, eclectic clothes and floating energy\
  \ all together. So, I patiently waited in a local Coffee shop for the tulips to\
  \ come alive, as a lover looks at you the morning after, adoring the silence.\n\n\
  The owner unlocked the door as I knocked, her first client. As she turned the music\
  \ on and my tea was close to a drinkable temperature, bicycles started running through\
  \ the street. The city was finally waking up and I had no time to lose, so I suddenly\
  \ saw myself at the Electric Ladyland Museum. Five euros sounded expensive, but\
  \ a place named after Jimmy Hendrick\u2019s song, located minutes away from Anne\
  \ Frank\u2019s House, was promising.\n\nIn that lost street, 13 people queued. A\
  \ few boat-like stairs to a basement and a pair of disposable shoes after, there\
  \ he was.\n\nBorn in the sixties, Roald Dahl\u2019s version of a hippie, waistcoat\
  \ full of badges ready to glow in the dark. I knew I\u2019d met him before, so I\
  \ carefully followed his siren-voice, calmly directing us curious humans to admire\
  \ the studio where he has spent more than 30 years.\n\nHealing music, fluorescent\
  \ colours, black lights, minerals, posters and familiar objects seen anew were both\
  \ stimulating and confusing. What was I doing here? What has he created here? Five\
  \ minutes after, I was deep into his world of fluorescent creatures and where to\
  \ find them. Then 45 minutes passed like five, and five euros felt like too little\
  \ for all he had shared.\n\nWhen had I seen him before? It\u2019s not when, but\
  \ where\u2026\n\nOne pub from the Thames, different body, same spirit. You will\
  \ find him only if you wander through the streets of London. Most probably in a\
  \ hidden corner of Southbank, under psychedelic Shakespeare graffiti. \n\nHe is\
  \ also surrounded by fluorescent envelopes. Same age, same skinny shape, same Gandalf\
  \ beard, same wisdom to his words. Just as mysterious as approachable. He\u2019\
  ll sing out loud each and every one of his poems if you don\u2019t dare to follow\
  \ your instinct and choose one. \n\nThe first day I met him, I didn\u2019t talk,\
  \ just admired him from a distance. Reading his book with his poems on the floor\
  \ outside Tate Modern, not trying to sell anything, just living. \n\nBut if you\
  \ do ask him, as I finally did the second time I encountered him, he will look at\
  \ you with honest and humble eyes, full of knowledge, before telling you he found\
  \ his path after being a nine to five man. \n\nOne poem might call to you, as Doors\
  \ of Magic did for me. Still not brave enough to just pick it, I begged him to tell\
  \ me more about it. \n\nAnd that\u2019s when he happily explained how each of us\
  \ has a door inside. Some don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there, others are unsure\
  \ how to open it or are afraid to enter, maybe. He told me your door is always waiting,\
  \ beating for you. But your door might not be my door.\n\nNow I search for him wherever\
  \ I travel. You could just call him the local character that helps define a place\
  \ in your memory. An exotic serendipity perhaps, someone from a d\xE9j\xE0 vu. But\
  \ it hardly does their magic any justice.\n\nWe will have to find him again, somewhere\u2026\
  \ everywhere."
