Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find: Paris in the Rain\n\n\nAnd this? This is a clich\xE9\
  . This is flowery, overflowing and climbing the walls, refusing to come back down\
  \ from the rooftop. I refuse to climb down and that\u2019s how life should be like.\
  \ Living like a clich\xE9, as foolishly naive and over-romanticizing as I wish.\
  \ And I refuse to be anything but. I  refuse to be milk and bananas.\n\n***\n\n\
  I\u2019ve been to Paris once. It wasn\u2019t that great. That doesn\u2019t mean\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t still daydream about Paris in the rain \u2013 the one you see\
  \ in the movies. The one you foolishly still believe in, like children believe in\
  \ the toothfairy.\n\nPoland, Krakow, didn\u2019t sound like Paris in the rain to\
  \ me. A school trip to Auschwitz\nreally, really didn\u2019t seem like Paris in\
  \ the rain. But it was. (Not the Auschwitz, though. That\u2019s another story.)\n\
  \nAlthough \u201Cthe rain\u201D was gigantic soap bubbles and \u201Cthe paris\u201D\
  \ was the streets of the Jewish part of Krakow. But laying in a bathtub, with what\
  \ was supposed to be bubbles but turned out to rather just be something pink-ish\
  \ that certainly didn\u2019t make bubbles, but hey, we tried \u2013 and listening\
  \ to the distant sounds of chatter in a foreign language and a street musician playing\
  \ something jazz-like, it was just that. Paris in the rain. \n\nKrakow was caramel\
  \ milkshakes and not knowing whether to drop the coins onto the cashier\u2019s palm\
  \ or just leave them on the table. Krakow was traditional folk music and pop songs\
  \ gone acapella. It was flowercrowns and violins. Unlike Paris, the actual Paris,\
  \ a postcard \u2013 the one I bought for myself instead of sending home, because\
  \ who\u2019d feel as warm inside as I do when looking at the memory \u2013  didn\u2019\
  t cost a fortune and the food in the restaurants didn\u2019t pretend to be something\
  \ else, something fancy for the Rich Only. I got a candle as a souvenir. It\u2019\
  s called spellbound, because that\u2019s how I felt. \n\nI\u2019ve never been into\
  \ early mornings, but Krakow made me into a morning person. The air smells different\
  \ in the mornings: like we\u2019re the first people to touch upon it. The streets\
  \ are almost empty and you can actually hear the city, not just the cars. Listen:\
  \ Krakow is talking. And it has so much to tell you.\n\nStories of the old tile\
  \ buildings. A bridge, out of nowhere, filled with graceful statues of girls on\
  \ unicycles or men sitting on balloons, tied to the metal of the bridge. And my\
  \ favorite thing while visiting a country: going grocery shopping, without really\
  \ having to buy anything boring like milk and bananas, but instead having the luxury\
  \ of spending time to look, to really look at everything new and to wonder how they\u2019\
  d taste, laughing at the weird stuff you find in a tiny corner shop. Buying a new\
  \ kind of candybar everytime and marveling over how even the bagels taste like Paris,\
  \ no, Krakow. Everything tastes like Krakow. Breath in: it\u2019s all Krakow, and\
  \ it\u2019s telling you a story. Your story.\n\nAnd Paris in the rain, no, Krakow\
  \ in the spring, it\u2019s real and it\u2019s here."
