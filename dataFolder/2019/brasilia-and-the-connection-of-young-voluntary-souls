Text: "Who would say that a week that started with me getting sick with the food of\
  \ the hotel would end up being the best of my life?\nFriendships, new learning about\
  \ the U.S. culture, history and traditions, connections with the local, young leaders\
  \ and volunteers from all of the states of Brazil plus a new network filled my life\
  \ with joy during and after this trip.\nA trip with a Shawn Mendes soundtrack \"\
  Never be alone\" and two memorable friends plus a crazy crowd of students watching\
  \ together Brazil\u2019s game on 2018 World Cup, seeing the country win in the middle\
  \ of the week and lose the games on our last moments in Brasilia was one of the\
  \ most striking moments of this adventure.\nOn July 1st, 2018 I had my first plane\
  \ trip leaving from a small district with destination to the capital of my country\
  \ Brasilia. I was selected as one of the 127 Brazilian teenagers chosen between\
  \ more than 24.000 inscriptions made for the U.S Embassy to go on a trip and learn\
  \ more about American culture and language during one week in Brasilia. \nEvery\
  \ day at 7:30 a.m we used to go by bus to Thomas Jefferson's House where we started\
  \ our daily event schedule and then at 10:00 a.m, we used to go see some touristic\
  \ spots. Moreover, during that week we had to prepare a group presentation for the\
  \ last day show, a general dance of the song \"Whatever it takes\" by Imagine Dragons\
  \ with only two rehearsals with my group and the other 100 students and participate\
  \ in the classes that would give us information about some aspects of the American\
  \ lifestyle. The evenings were designated for cultural or social programs like watching\
  \ a concert and bowling in a shopping mall. \nAn interesting fact is that Brasilia\
  \ is a city with a lot of cars and almost no people walking on the streets. In a\
  \ certain way, the only scene I can remember of people actually on the streets was\
  \ of two men running in a park plus a traditional soccer game in a closed field.\
  \ Furthermore, as an active observer, I could notice that it is a place filled with\
  \ some contradictions. As an example, we passed by bus through a building of the\
  \ Ministry of Labour and there was a huge poster where you could read written in\
  \ Portuguese \"Stop child labor\" but in a few meters ahead a kid maybe by the age\
  \ of 10 to 13 years old was selling snacks in the traffic light. It made me think\
  \ about how many contradictions my country still have hidden inside those magnificent\
  \ buildings beside the poverty that reigns in other parts of the country.\nMy traveling\
  \ partner, an 18 years old girl, in less than a month, had been cured of cancer\
  \ that required more than 6 months of treatment from her and they fortunately compensated.\
  \ Also, my new friend, a boy victim of the post-discovery depression of being HIV-positive,\
  \ was committed with remaking his life there, making a new path full of activities,\
  \ purpose, and happiness that they made a point of sharing with the other teenagers\
  \ of the trip.\nThe states of Brazil, 5th largest country in the world, represented\
  \ by the youth united in one place, in tune with the same purpose. \nI remain amazed\
  \ with the poetry in the act of meeting souls from every corner of the country,\
  \ at our differences, accents, opinions and yet the consistent unity, the dreams\
  \ and goals of each one I have had the opportunity to meet. Always remains the feeling\
  \ that I should have talked more, known more people. However, I believe in the high\
  \ probability that we might meet again in a close future to laugh at the table of\
  \ a steakhouse as we did listening to each other and exchanging typical expressions\
  \ of each region of the country. Although we are so different, with distant vocations\
  \ and dreams we have been following the same path leading the social change and\
  \ working to make our local connections become global ties."
