Text: "When my friend asked if I wanted to go to Cuba for spring break in 2018, I\
  \ was hesitant to say yes. I didn't know much about Cuba, except they had the old\
  \ school cars or as I now know as botero's. So I took the leap and decided that\
  \ I was going to embark on a journey. We flew out of BWI in Maryland, and I had\
  \ butterflies in my stomach. I didn't know what to expect - I've traveled quite\
  \ a bit but not so much in Latin America. Much of my hesitation was because I'm\
  \ plus size and I didn't know how others abroad would react to my body. I also hesitant\
  \ about the language barrier, fortunately my friend spoke decent Spanish and I knew\
  \ key phrases such as: \"Cuanto cuesta\". \n\nAs we approached Cuba a sense of wonder\
  \ and excitement came over me. My hesitation and nerves floated away and I was left\
  \ with childlike anticipation of discovering this new destination. The moment I\
  \ stepped off the plane, I knew Cuba would forever hold a special place in my heart.\
  \ We stayed at an Air B&B in the vibrant community of Vedado, just 15 minutes outside\
  \ of Havana. We're directly right across from FAC, also known as F\xE1brica. It's\
  \ world renowned because it's outside appearance doesn't seem promising. It's magical.\
  \ It's an old factory that's been renovated into an art gallery, a restaurant, and\
  \ turns into a club at night. Anyone who visits Cuba has to visit F\xE1brica! \n\
  \nI think most look at Cuba and think how they survive with their intense and intricate\
  \ history. However, the people of Cuba do most things we do not here in America.\
  \ They live. I mean truly live, they are happy, open, and always willing to help\
  \ one another out. Our neighbors next door to our Air B&B, became like older brothers\
  \ to us. They took care of us, made sure we were safe, and always gave us a ride\
  \ without any hesitation. They didn't even overcharge us because we were tourists.\
  \ They simply welcomed us into their world - to their existence and showed us what\
  \ humanity is all about. \n\nEverywhere we went, my friends and I were welcomed\
  \ with open arms. My insecurities faded from my mind and for the first time in a\
  \ very long time I felt free. Free to live a life untainted by society's oppressive\
  \ and unattainable standards. Free to express myself and allow my voice to be heard.\
  \ Free to finally be who I am. Cuba was one of the best travel experiences of my\
  \ life, it truly shaped the remainder of my year in 2018. When it was time to leave\
  \ I was overcome with grief. I was only there for a week, but I felt like I was\
  \ leaving home. Uncertain of when I will return, I am most certain Cuba and I will\
  \ once be reunited to pick up on the magical moments where we left off."
