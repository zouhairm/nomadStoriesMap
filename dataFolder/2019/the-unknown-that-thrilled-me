Text: "From all I thought of Colombia, I would never imagine that this country could\
  \ be so similar to Brazil. Nature, colors, and people. For a long time, I have been\
  \ blind as a result of many years of stereotypes I have heard about Colombia. Amusingly,\
  \ the differences were the primary factor which captivated me to leave Brazil and\
  \ live an exchange program there. The unknown thrilled me; I had the opportunity\
  \ to discover myself, and also be the person who would make my own analysis about\
  \ the history, the culture, and the reality of this country.\nAfter only fifteen\
  \ days living in the capital, Bogot\xE1, my host family invited me to travel to\
  \ the place which they called \u2018the paradise in the middle of nowhere,\u2019\
  \ Pueblo de la Colina del R\xEDo Negro. It was the ultimate opportunity I had to\
  \ see the real side of the country, far from a big metropolis. Arriving at El Pueblo,\
  \ I felt like I have been broken into several parts. It was very similar to my grandparent's\
  \ community in the rural area of Brazil. No asphalt, no traffic lights, and music\
  \ playing in every corner. At La Colina, the locals resembled people from the placed\
  \ I was born - close, warm, and welcoming. Spanish was the only factor that differentiated\
  \ them from Brazilians. Previously, I have imagined a place with a different architecture,\
  \ customs, and way of living.\nIndeed, it was in the midst of the simplicity I found\
  \ my final connection to home. My host mother would always say that there was only\
  \ one grocery store for the entire pueblo, the miscelanea. For me it was unreliable,\
  \ however, as time passed, I recognized that she was completely right. The week\
  \ I stayed there, I found all I needed, and the initial super necessity for big\
  \ markets seemed irrelevant. However, the miscelanea from La colina was already\
  \ present in my life when I went to \u2018mercearias\u2019 in Brazil with the same\
  \ intention to find \u2018all in one place.\u2019 \nAltogether, small similarities\
  \ transformed my vision that Latin America countries could be much similar than\
  \ what one day I have thought, and the certainty that differences or similarities\
  \ about my homeland will be a small factor if I bring with me my origins, open mind,\
  \ and the curiosity that drove me to explore the unknown new world."
