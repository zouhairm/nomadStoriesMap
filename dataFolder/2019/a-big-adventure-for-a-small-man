Text: "My story took place in July 2018. So I was in China, I was an exchange student\
  \ who came there to study Chinese. My university was located in Shenyang, it\u2019\
  s a north-eastern city. 1 year of studies has passed very quickly, it was filled\
  \ with a lot of unforgettable stories. But there was one thing I couldn\u2019t do\
  \ that was to visit Beijing. Usually when one says \u201CChina\u201D, first of all,\
  \ you imagine The Great Wall, Chinese architecture, Chinese food and Beijing itself.\
  \ By the end of my year I have visited The Great Wall, tried delicious Chinese food\
  \  and saw some Chinese architecture, but I didn\u2019t have a chance to visit the\
  \ capital city of China. I\u2019ve made really good friends there, but when summer\
  \ vacation started, they all went home. So I was left alone in my dormitory room.\
  \ I thought I missed my chance and I\u2019d never be able to visit the city.\nAnd\
  \ then I thought that it was probably my only chance being in China, and such a\
  \ small thing as being alone wouldn\u2019t make me stop and give up on my dream.\
  \ So yes! I started planning my 3-day trip. My friends and family encouraged me,\
  \ though I had a very small fear that something might go wrong, I was afraid for\
  \ my safety. But, anyway, I had a good mind to fulfill my dream. So the long awaited\
  \ day came, and I went to the train station and my big journey started. On my first\
  \ day I managed to check-in and went to visit unique Beijing Opera. On the second\
  \ day I went to the Tianmen Square, the Palace Museum and Jingshan Park. I was amazed\
  \ by the Chinese culture, architecture and its people. My third day I devoted to\
  \ seeing the Temple of Heaven and the Olympic Park. Never in my life I had to walk\
  \ on foot so much, however I felt nothing but joy and peace. I could have never\
  \ imagined that I would be sitting in the Olympic Stadium, the same place that I\
  \ saw on a TV screen when I was 12 years old. It felt fantastic! By the end of my\
  \ trip I realized that I am capable of anything, like literally anything. I was\
  \ very proud of myself. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll go there back again.\nTo sum up,\
  \ of course, it\u2019s more fun to travel with people you love, like friends or\
  \ family, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t go anywhere without them\
  \ and deprive yourself of the opportunity to feel and see with your own eyes, and\
  \ not some Instagram pictures, what a wonderful world you live in. Planning the\
  \ trip, I was imagining myself as a some kind of hobbit, like Bilbo Baggins, going\
  \ on a life changing trip, with big and na\xEFve heart, who had to fight against\
  \ evil and horrible Orcs; such a small man exploring this great world. But in reality\
  \ everything turned out to be much better, I\u2019ve seen beautiful places and met\
  \ kind and generous people there. So what I want to say is don\u2019t be afraid.\
  \ Of course, anything unknown scares us because we are not sure if we have enough\
  \ courage and power to face it, but you can never know what you or can\u2019t do\
  \ unless you try. Going on a trip is a great chance not only to discover beautiful\
  \ places and local culture, but also to learn more about yourself. So take risks\
  \ and go for it!"
