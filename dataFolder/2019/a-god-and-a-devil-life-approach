Text: "Oppositely to Mexico and to many other warmer countries, stray dogs don\u2019\
  t teem in Latvia. Weather is, of course, a determining condition for this fact since\
  \ they would not survive on the frozen streets. So they either live in a shelter\
  \ hoping for an adoptive family, or they already have a human companion, so when\
  \ you try to make friends with dogs, most times, the human companions are also there,\
  \ and also, most times they become challenges between you and the four-legged potential\
  \ new friend.\nI would still try every time, human interaction in between and all;\
  \ so this allowed me to pet many dogs and interact with many humans. But one particular\
  \ night of 2017, it wasn\u2019t me who made the first move.\nI was sitting by the\
  \ window in KKC (a trendy local bar), waiting for my smoker friends to come back\
  \ inside and continue our conversations, when I felt a humid, hairy, warm breath\
  \ on the back of my left hand.\nA small creature with pointy ears and wondering\
  \ gaze was there. I instantly loved her and slowly we engaged into a spellbound\
  \ exchange of funny and gruff jiggery-pokery, which escalated to me not caring about\
  \ the surroundings and using a very ridiculous voice tone to tell her repeatedly:\n\
  - You don\u2019t have a nose, you flat, pug, inexistent nose -\nAs for her, took\
  \ place as biting my hands, soaking them in extra stinky saliva and making pig noises.\
  \ \nWe were very happy. And after some minutes of this, her human came over to us\
  \ from the other side of the bar, with a leash on his hands.\nAt first I thought\
  \ she would be in trouble, but instead, she was encouraged to keep chilling with\
  \ me by this guy, who also decided to tell me the story of the creature. Her name:\
  \ Madame Zuzu.\n- She belongs to my sister, who leads a \u201Cnormal\u201D life\
  \ - he said, quoting with his fingers the normal part.\nAnd then continued with\
  \ the tale:\n- With my sister she has comfort, and safety, good food, a place to\
  \ nap, routine. But sometimes she is out of town and I take care of Madame Zuzu.\
  \ She spends some days with me, and I take her everywhere I go- \nI nodded in silence,\
  \ listening, observing, and still playing with the smelly creature.\nThe guy got\
  \ thoughtful, and continued with his train of reasoning by saying in a mysterious\
  \ voice:\n- I think she is very lucky, because she gets to have a double life. Two\
  \ lives that are right for her: the organized one and the adventurous one. She has\
  \ two gods, and two lives. One for each, and each as good as the other one. It is\
  \ not like for humans, you see? we usually have a god and a devil, and we struggle\
  \ with our double lives - he finished saying and our eyes met for an instant.\n\
  It is impossible to know for sure, but I\u2019m quite certain at that moment we\
  \ both realized about the strength of his idea, the power of his words, and the\
  \ irony and magic of this moment. So we got speechless because that is what happens\
  \ with words, they tend to be not enough.\nI smiled, thanked him and Madame Zuzu,\
  \ and they went on with their double life as I went on with mine."
