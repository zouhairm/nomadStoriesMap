Text: "We sat at a table you would find on a film set for The Road, eating salad crackers\
  \ and a two-liter bottle of Pepsi. The pressures of home all but disappeared. All\
  \ that mattered were the thankful eyes that surrounded the extravagant meal.\n\n\
  This was my first time out of the US, and I was a quick study, but geographical\
  \ overviews of \u201Cthe place of many trees\u201D and biographies centered on the\
  \ Guatemalan civil war will not prepare you to share the sufferings and joys and\
  \ hopes of families that have been subsistence farmers for generations. We were\
  \ visiting friends who lived their lives here in Guatemala, committed to serving\
  \ and sharing life through their nonprofit organization in San Crist\xF3bal that\
  \ established a community youth center and delivered cooking and heating home for\
  \ families that lived in surrounding villages, that otherwise could not afford them,\
  \ normally building fires on the dirt floors of their homes, leading health issues\
  \ later in life. I had raised donations to buy ten stoves and was here to help install\
  \ them. \n\nWe spent several afternoons at La Zona Exrema getting to know the organization\
  \ staff and playing with the kids who came to play billiards, lift weights, and\
  \ skate a halfpipe built in the building\u2019s courtyard. As one of the few tall,\
  \ awkward white Americans, who could help but laugh? But the jesting was in good\
  \ fun, making friends out of the staff members who would spare a moment to converse\
  \ in poorly cadenced, broken Spanish. The kids had the most fun quizzing me their\
  \ English vocab words from school and asking for a hard American accent. The Zona\
  \ was an investment into this backwater city \u2014 a way to share embodied lives\
  \ with the people of San Crist\xF3bal.\n\nLater in the week, as we drove up to the\
  \ villages, our new local friends graciously chose to ride in the bed with climbing\
  \ pads to cushion the rocky drive so we could ride in the cab with the organization\
  \ leaders. Riding in the bed was no easy task as we passed thick jungle over rugged\
  \ road to get to the high elevation communities where the stoves would be installed.\
  \ After a two hour ride and a short backpacking trek through covered trails and\
  \ wide vistas, we assembled stoves at several different communities across the ridge.\
  \ The recipient families were responsible for transporting the stoves from the city\
  \ up to their mountain village. It was clear by that task alone, this was no handout.\
  \ This was us extending a hand, these families extending theirs, saying, \u201C\
  as friends and partners, we will work together.\u201D\n\nThe last family gave us\
  \ a short tour of their neatly organized farm. As we approached their small one-room\
  \ home, we passed a border of fruit trees that our friends had no English name for.\
  \ They led us over a ridge to a valley of coffee plants the family had carefully\
  \ nurtured from seeds in their hillside greenhouse, down cleanly terraced trails,\
  \ to their carefully trellised crop. Like so many other Guatemalans, the family\
  \ had seen hard times in past years, and was risking needed income and yearly food\
  \ yields to try a cash crop besides the local varieties of beans and corn. So this\
  \ home stove had come at an exciting time \u2014 a time of joy and risk and hope\
  \ for the future.\n\nWe sat at a table, eating salad crackers and drinking a two-liter\
  \ bottle of Pepsi. This was a gift even wealthy Americans visitors would enjoy.\
  \ For a moment, it didn\u2019t seem like there was a job to be done or a bar to\
  \ achieve. This was their communion prepared for us, bread and wine presented before\
  \ now deeply humbled guests. Later, I could be far away, forgetting the terraced\
  \ rows of coffee cherries and fruits I had never heard of. But right now, it was\
  \ a joy to be part of the family, even just for a moment. We were invited into the\
  \ fight to make a way for their future. Just for a moment, we shared a meal in the\
  \ flesh, eyes penetrating to reciprocally thankful hearts."
