Text: "The oversized speed boat rocked uncomfortably, forcing me to tighten my grip\
  \ on the stanchion to keep balance. My insides felt just as unsteady - excitement\
  \ and uncertainty warred for attention. The thrum of the engines vibrated through\
  \ my hands and feet.\nBeing first in line next to our team leader, I glanced to\
  \ my left at the others in my group and wondered if they too were experiencing their\
  \ hearts beating as hard and as loudly as mine. \nSurely not, I thought. I could\
  \ hear little else. \nThe call came, loud and startling. Go! Go! Go! I took a deep\
  \ breath\u2026 and leapt for the dark blue water of the Pacific Ocean.\nWe were\
  \ five kilometres off shore from Queensland\u2019s Sunshine Coast, and thanks to\
  \ the ground-breaking work of Sunreef Mooloolaba, we were about to go free-swimming\
  \ with a Humpback whale.\n\nThe shock of the cold water sucked all the air from\
  \ me, and I surfaced, spluttering and gasping, trying to get my breathing under\
  \ control. Around me, others in my team were just as disoriented, but somehow, we\
  \ managed to stay close to each other as the Team Leader called out for us to regroup.\n\
  As the name implies, free-swimming means no guide-ropes, no safety nets. When the\
  \ Team Leader calls, we are required to follow their instructions, both for safety\
  \ reasons and to maximize the chances of a sighting.\nSo, I bobbed and swam\u2026\
  \ freely\u2026 towards her with my head above water until I could breathe evenly\
  \ enough to duck my face down to peer through my mask. \nThe light, playing through\
  \ the water, gave no sense of distance or depth, and without a solid reference point\
  \ I was immediately drifting in an endless dance of light and shadow, which, in\
  \ this blue grey void was both immensely peaceful, and somewhat scary \u2013 perhaps\
  \ my more instinctive nature reacting to the vast unseen beneath me. \nThe slap\
  \ of water against my mask and the whoosh of my breathing through the snorkel were\
  \ very loud, while faintly, I could hear the calls of my Team Leader and the Captain\
  \ trying to direct us over a nearby whale footprint \u2013 a small patch of calmness\
  \ created by the movement of their tail through the water.\nBut that was it. No\
  \ whales.\nA little disappointed, I turned to swim towards my team just as a dozen\
  \ bottle-nosed dolphins materialised out of the gloom. \n\nWhat an exciting bonus!\
  \ I\u2019d grown up only seeing these magnificent creatures as tame entertainment,\
  \ with all wildness trained out of them. And now, in the blink of an eye, I was\
  \ in their \u2018marine world\u2019, within touching distance of their mottled and\
  \ scarred grey skin as they cavorted playfully around us. \nIf I could have laughed\
  \ with glee I would have!\nThe role reversal was not lost on me.  Now I was their\
  \ brief form of entertainment, the subject of their curiosity and wonder. What did\
  \ they think of this funny finless creature with an odd flat featured face and gesticulating\
  \ limbs? As air breathing kin? Were they mocking my lack of swimming finesse with\
  \ their smooth twists and tail flicks that allowed them to stay close but effortlessly\
  \ far away?\n\nAnd then, below me, she appeared.\nShe glided by, belly up, silent,\
  \ peering up at me. Much of her body was in shadow, but still, enough to fill my\
  \ vision. \nAll my emotions \u2013 fear, happiness, surprise \u2013 evaporated.\
  \ I felt incredibly\u2026 insignificant, my carefully constructed human identity\
  \ stripped away. I floated, helpless as a newborn child. \nOne of the world\u2019\
  s most intelligent species chose to share her space with me, and I was humbled.\
  \  \nForty years ago, there were few of her kin alive. Today, 9 of the 14 known\
  \ populations of Humpback Whale are officially off the endangered list. We\u2019\
  re finally at a point where our two species can mingle with\u2026 cautious awareness?\
  \ Perhaps a shared desire to make sense of our world through observation and interaction?\n\
  And then she was gone, swallowed by the shadows. A part of my soul disappeared into\
  \ the void with her.\nOur worlds had connected for just 10 seconds. \n10, life-changing,\
  \ seconds.\nI couldn\u2019t have asked for more."
