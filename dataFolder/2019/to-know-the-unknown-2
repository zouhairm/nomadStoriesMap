Text: "I had a similar experience to the late John Muir when he said, \u201CThe mountains\
  \ are calling and I must go.\u201D Except my words were, \u201CThe world is calling\
  \ and I must go.\u201D \n\nI took some huge leaps from Romania and Peru, to India\
  \ and Chile, then finally to Ukraine and Nepal. Having been born and raised solely\
  \ in Birmingham, Alabama, the entire world was the unknown. The people, the colors\
  \ of their clothes, the smells of their streets, the sounds of their tongues, the\
  \ taste of their foods and the feeling of their embrace were all unknown. It remained\
  \ this way until, in blind faith, my feet touched their soil. \n\nIn an instant\
  \ things began to wake up inside of me. The unknown became known as my head did\
  \ not hit a pillow for thirty plus hours of travel. Through my lack of sleep I somehow\
  \ felt alive. I took my seat next to the window while the screechy train left the\
  \ station in Bucharest, Romania. The brush on either side of the tracks was high\
  \ and tangled only for a moment revealing the rural plains of towns we passed. An\
  \ elderly woman with a wrapped wrist occupied the seat in front of me. After a while\
  \ of sharing the table for her reading and my journaling, I spoke a word in the\
  \ only language I knew. \u201CHello!\u201D This was followed by a blank look and\
  \ my further attempts to mime, \u2018what is your name?\u2019 In broken English,\
  \ we engaged in momentary glimpses of each other\u2019s lives. Ileana was on her\
  \ way to visit her daughter who lived past my stop. When the train announced that\
  \ we had reached Dragonesti Olt, Ileana was on her feet helping me collect my life\
  \ that was packed in a 65L Osprey backpack and a day pack. She prayed with me and\
  \ sent me off, but through that streaky window the sun beamed on her smiling face\
  \ and the palm of her waving hand. \n\nFrom the moment that I said hello to this\
  \ arresting Romanian woman, the unknown became known.  \n\nThere is freedom in not\
  \ allowing the unknown to remain unknown. I believe that this is where true life\
  \ is found. Ignorance had once allowed me to get from point A to point B in life\
  \ as comfortably as possible. This ignorance continued to crack as I journeyed on.\
  \ I met Lucio in his tienda and that simple conversation in broken English led to\
  \ a day of leaping, with him and his family, into a chilled river at the foothills\
  \ of the Peruvian mountains where he was raised. Now when I hear of India, I can\
  \ taste the curry, smell the cattle, and remember Esther, a woman whose husband\
  \ had passed away five years earlier but continuously proclaimed \u201CHis grace\
  \ is sufficient for me.\u201D I will always feel the somewhat sloppy kiss on my\
  \ cheek from Carlito in Los Andes, Chile, as we greeted each other and the way my\
  \ heart felt as I listened to him give his father\u2019s eulogy. In Ukraine, people\
  \ of all ages had a tenacious yearning to learn English. For them, it held the hope\
  \ of more job opportunities and a better life. I was blessed enough to help them\
  \ reach that. At an orphanage just outside of Kathmandu, Nepal, the unknown, as\
  \ I laughed and danced with a three year old girl, became known when I learned that\
  \ divorce typically means that the child gets abandoned. \n\nEach story that I could\
  \ tell you is full and has a heartbeat. I have been blessed with opportunities to\
  \ have stories of far away lands as well as those on the soil of home. But each\
  \ of these stories has a universal heartbeat- a heart beat that cares not about\
  \ geography or circumstance, but creates a heart that belongs to the world and its\
  \ colors, tastes, smells, languages, and people. A beat that is undeniable for those\
  \ that choose to listen and follow."
