Text: 'Hello!

  Iam Asifa Batori,and I am writing about different things always specailly when something
  happen I try to write that and convey for others,so now I am so happy that get chance
  to apply here and can travel and see amazing things for writting.

  I love to travel in different country and write about that country it was my wish
  and now its my goal. I hope that can use from this chance and travel for finding
  wonderful things for writing.

  I love writing so much that I can convey my having mine for others and I am sure
  that this travel can be a benefit expierence for me that know new things and write
  about that amazing things and convey for others .

  Traveling is the secret of writing that a person when travel in a country in fuct
  he/she open a new page in his / her life so opening a new page in life is not an
  essay work and a person can not make that essally unless you travel and know different
  things about other people of world about their languge about their cultuer about
  their behavier whit others and other things all of them are a chance for us that
  we can understant them and write that .


  Respectfully :- Asifa batori'
