Text: "The little Cessna hurtled into the thin air over Ecuador, wisps of wet clouds\
  \ caressing the fuselage. Below us stretched the ravages of a modern-day gold rush.\
  \ Jagged wounds of deforestation followed new roads as oilmen, lumberers and ranchers\
  \ penetrated ever deeper into the rainforest.\n\nSuddenly we descended over an unbroken\
  \ expanse of green. This was the Transcucut\xFA, an unspoiled but impoverished region\
  \ cut off from the world by mountains on one side and the Peruvian border on the\
  \ other.\n\nWe approached a small clearing and bounced onto a grass landing strip.\
  \ Here in the village of Charuz, unreachable by road, indigenous Shuar people struggle\
  \ to defend their way of life against the invaders.\n\nThe first outsiders to arrive,\
  \ our guide Rosita explained, were Evangelical Christian missionaries who converted\
  \ the inhabitants of Charuz, forbidding them to speak their language and teaching\
  \ them their god Ar\xFAtam is a demon. Meanwhile, Catholics converted another Shuar\
  \ community, causing a rift. Finally the Shuar expelled all the missionaries. But\
  \ the culture had been breached. Younger Shuar speak Spanish now and eagerly adopt\
  \ innovations like the generator-powered TV showing soccer games.\n\nSome age-old\
  \ ways live on. Rosita pointed out two matching huts: the respective homes of local\
  \ chief Lucas Kashijint's two wives. I smiled, looking forward to meeting the big\
  \ man.\n\nA passel of children swarmed the plane. One small boy took my hand as\
  \ we walked toward the rough wooden lodge where villagers waited for us.\n\nThe\
  \ chief, a stocky, self-assured man, was dressed in beads, feathers, face paint,\
  \ a tattered German soccer shirt, and a Tweety Bird beach towel. (Clothes donated\
  \ by foreign charities are gradually replacing traditional attire.)\n\nI sat spellbound\
  \ as Lucas performed a welcoming dance \u2013 repeatedly lunging at us with his\
  \ spear, only to step back and lower it. Rosita translated: The dance asks whether\
  \ visitors come in peace or war. Fortunately this was resolved in favor of the former.\n\
  \nOur group presented gifts of soccer balls. The hosts reciprocated with a keer,\
  \ a two-stringed instrument of cedar wood about the size of a ukelele. The young\
  \ man who had made it demonstrated its haunting tones with a bow.\n\nWe sat on tree\
  \ stumps for the feast: cachama fish, boiled whole, and stacks of boiled yucca.\
  \ Everything was eaten by hand, corn-on-the-cob style.\n\nNext came chicha, a fermented\
  \ yucca drink that is central to Shuar culture. It was powerful stuff and the locals\
  \ quickly became festive. Women passed a bowl around the room, stirring the contents\
  \ with their hands.\n\nNone of the other foreigners partook, but I wanted to be\
  \ a gracious guest. I took a sip \u2013 I would pay later with a case of traveler\u2019\
  s tummy. It was like watery, yellowish oatmeal with a beery smell. I recalled hearing\
  \ that women traditionally grind the yucca for chicha with their teeth \u2013 and\
  \ hurriedly repressed the thought.\n\nLucas lorded over the banquet table. I wondered\
  \ how to engage such a commanding figure, and tried a smalltalk standby, \u201C\
  How many children do you have?\u201D\n\n\u201CI have 22 children,\u201D he bellowed,\
  \ without looking up from his plate. I decided to shut up.\n\nI was barely through\
  \ my first yucca when Rosita bustled us out to the airstrip. A gathering storm threatened\
  \ our takeoff. The last time that happened, the visitors were stuck here for two\
  \ weeks and riddled with mosquito bites.\n\nWe shouted our farewells over the engine\
  \ noise and children chased the plane along the runway.\n\nThe pilot banked and\
  \ circled a pair of glistening green hills framing a narrow waterfall that is, Rosita\
  \ explained, sacred to the Shuar. Already there is talk of its tourist potential.\n\
  \nThe road is coming soon, she said flatly. The Shuar look forward to access to\
  \ markets and to medical care their shaman can\u2019t deliver. But they\u2019re\
  \ wary about the future as industries advance on their ancestral lands. \u201CAr\xFA\
  tam will help them,\u201D Rosita said, looking away from the window.\n\nShuar traditions\
  \ have a fearsome guardian in Lucas. But his offspring, like kids everywhere, snicker\
  \ at their old man and his ancient dances. The music of the modern world is rumbling\
  \ like thunder on the horizon, and the faint notes of the keer will be no match."
