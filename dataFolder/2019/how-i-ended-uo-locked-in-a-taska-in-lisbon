Text: "standing outside the classroom with a group of my fellow master degree student\
  \ at the University of Salamanca in Spain , I could listen to everyone\u2019s plans\
  \ for the long weekend holyday, many of my friend were looking forward to going\
  \ back home to visit family . I, a Mexican international student was facing a long\
  \ weekend alone with no friends in town to make plans with. Monica from Ecuador\
  \ was on the same boat , we had not talk much  or hung out a lot during the time\
  \ we had known each other , but we both wanted to have and adventure and enjoy \
  \ the holyday , so on the spot  we decided to take a trip together . Lisbon Portugal\
  \ was or chosen travel destination, travel time was short from Spain and it was\
  \ a budget friendly destination for two student with not a lot of extra Money to\
  \ spend.  I was not expecting much, to tell the truth I had little to no knowledge\
  \ of Portugal, and it was not on my list of countries to visit.  But the next day,\
  \ after class Monica and I took the bus headed to Lisbon.  I slept most to the bus\
  \ ride, but when it was time to arrive I was wide awake and it was right then that\
  \ Lisbon gave me the first of many surprises..  The view of the city as we were\
  \ arriving was magical, the 25 of April Bridge stood tall and majestic while the\
  \ city lights reflecting on the water seem to welcome us.  After leaving or luggage\
  \ at the hotel in barrio alto, we decided to go out and explore, we had one mission.\
  \  To find something to eat, we were both starving, it was pretty late and everywhere\
  \ we went the kitchen was already close , and the few places with service had pre\
  \ fixed menus , with a fado show included , for about 40 to 50 euros per person\
  \ , a lot more that we could afford to spend in just one meal. So we just kept walking\
  \ until we found o small restaurant it was still serving food, traditional Portuguese\
  \ food a la carte and with very good prices so we went inside, the interior was\
  \ simple and inviting with mosaics in the wall in blue and yellow. The waiter was\
  \ very friendly and entertaining, we order sardinhas, sardines grill, with coarse\
  \ salt, and they were savory and juicy and were accompanied by a very fresh salad\
  \ with a very simple olive oil and vinegar dressing, , and the house white wine\
  \ was delicious and crisp very similar to an  albari\xF1o from Galicia. We were\
  \ half way into or dinner talking about or plans for the next day and having a very\
  \ relaxing and wonderful meal  when all of a sudden we notice the waiters closing\
  \ all the windows with wood shutters , and closing the door , Monica and me got\
  \ really nervous , what was going on ? , were we getting robed? \u2026  looking\
  \ around most of the other dinners seem unafraid talking and drinking like nothing\
  \ weird was happening , then the lights went out , we are in big trouble now we\
  \ thought.  As we were getting ready to flee the owner came out the back playing\
  \ a guitar  and out nowhere an un assuming lady started singing the most hunting\
  \ , sad and moving fado song.  We were glue to our seats listening to the song and\
  \ feeling very relived. After the song ended we were clapping like crazy, she was\
  \ incredible. But being the budget mindful travelers we are, we worried we were\
  \ going to be charged for the show. We waived the waiter over and tried to ask in\
  \ half Spanish and half broken Portuguese about a fee for the show, the waiter just\
  \ smiled and said that there was no extra charge to listen to the singer. So we\
  \ decided to order another glass of wine and enjoy the evening, every single person\
  \ in the restaurant was having an amazing time. It was like getting invited to a\
  \ secret concert just for a group of friends. Lisbon surprised me again."
