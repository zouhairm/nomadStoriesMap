Text: "Travel adapter, glares, clothes, and a charger. All packed and set to catch\
  \ the flight to Singapore. It was 2012, I was on my way to start my usual yearly\
  \ trip to my chosen destination.\n\nI landed at T3, Changi Airport with least expectations\
  \ because I was so busy working that I couldn't plan my leaves which is very rare.\
  \ \n\nNight flights are the best but tiring, all I was looking forward was to a\
  \ power nap in my hotel but what I got at the airport gave a kickstart to my holiday\
  \ - free leg massagers. \n\nThanks to the massage, I hoped on one of the cheapest\
  \ transport, the metro and made my way to the hotel in just $3. Singapore public\
  \ transport provides extreme connectivity but some of these options are expensive\
  \ as well. \n\nMarina bay, the prime area of the city is home to many beautiful\
  \ sights and attractions. I started my day on the scooter at Garden by the Bay and\
  \ called it a day after a 40 minutes cruise at the Merlion park. \n\nSecond day\
  \ bought a lot of excitement as it was planned to be spent at Sentosa Island, home\
  \ to fun, adventure and a beautiful beach. The trip becomes more fun due to the\
  \ cable car ride which starts at Harbour front.\n\n1 day is not enough to experience\
  \ all the things that this island offers, it can easily take 3 days to cover Sentosa\
  \ Island(including Universal Studios).\n\nAfter a day full of excitement, it was\
  \ time for shopping and what could be better than exploring Orchid Road. It is a\
  \ hub of high end brands and other tempting brands like Victoria Secret as well.\
  \ It was a perfect shopping experience which ended at Clarke quay. One of the best\
  \ places to enjoy night life in this city.\n\nWaking up to the mesmerizing view\
  \ of Singapore Eye at Pan Pacific made my trip worth every penny I spent. It was\
  \ time to visit River Safari followed by a trip to the famous Night Safari. It was\
  \ a good experience but not as good as the African safari.\n\nIt was time to pack\
  \ mg bags and head back to home but I didn't want to as so much more was left to\
  \ explore.\n\nI didn't expect to find so many attractions and amazing lifestyle\
  \ in Singapore. It was a wonderful surprise for me and till 2019, I have explored\
  \ Singapore thrice and everytime I find new things to do which give me another reason\
  \ to visit again."
