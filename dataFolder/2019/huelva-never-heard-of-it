Text: "Huelva would not be the first or the second city that I would think of thinking\
  \ of Spain, to be honest it would not even make it in the top 10 or 15 but Huelva\
  \ it is a little unexplored unchanged reality that lives its life without looking\
  \ up much at what goes on outside of it. In Huelva you won\u2019t find strings of\
  \ tourists queuing outside the museum or you won\u2019t always find people with\
  \ their noses up in the sky admiring the architecture but there is more you will\
  \ discover. You will find truth, you will find amazing and reasonably priced goodies,\
  \ you will taste some of the best food you have eaten, you will find people so nice\
  \ and so proud of their territory that would do anything to make you see their city\
  \ the way they see it. I arrived in Huelva at the end of February and I was simply\
  \ amazed by the sun warm welcoming, I got sunburnt in two days Huelva has, in fact,\
  \ some amazing desolate beaches to where you can get by a 1,75 euros bus fare. As\
  \ arrived with a bus from Sevilla I made my way up from the little harbor to my\
  \ apartment in Calle Macias Rodriguez. On the way the city switched from big white\
  \ paved streets to big concrete road, kept it together with the endless lines of\
  \ bright orange and green orange trees that walk with you wherever you go. Huelva\
  \ is divided between people born and raised here that celebrate the Carnival, Dia\
  \ de Andalucia, Semana Santa that are the colorful core of the city and the constant\
  \ flow of Erasmus students that keep the city vibrant and young. When I first got\
  \ here, I thought the city was on the beach, it turns out the beach is 20 minutes\
  \ away, but the two rivers and the amazing National Park are just on your doorstep.\
  \ Blessed by the sun, this unspoiled reality is one hour away from Portugal or Cadiz\
  \ and it will make you feel like you just discover a little island where there are\
  \ not all the easy facilities but there is uncontaminated beauty."
