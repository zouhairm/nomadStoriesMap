Text: "The Mulotana Hamlet\nI always had an interest of travelling to a little hamlet\
  \ called Mulotana. Once I got a chance to visit the hamlet, I didn\u2019t lose it.\
  \ That happened in 2014.\nIn my country, there was a lovely train that took people\
  \ from down town to Ressano Garcia, which makes the borders with south Africa, but\
  \ my destiny was mulotane, the hamlet. That train carried young and old man from\
  \ the other communities of Mozambique.\nIt was a great experience to see the beautiful\
  \ hamlet in Maputo province, called Mulotana.  I decided to stretch my body walking\
  \ some kilometers away from the urban area of Maputo province and I was getting\
  \ ready and excited to experience a wonderful bush place with small hills surrounded\
  \ by animals, there could not be something better.\nThe scramble began as soon I\
  \ got into the train. On the train, I knew many people who were going to Mulotana.\
  \ That was my first impression. The majority of people whom I met are peasants and\
  \ wood workers. From those people, I learnt many things through a nice conversation.\
  \ I had opportunity to know a wise and simple man called Djimo, this man is a peasant\
  \ and he told me something interesting: \"we can develop our communities, turning\
  \ them into cities, we can even have the best technology but we are nothing if we\
  \ don\u2019t have place which reminds us about the nature\".\nDuring the journey,\
  \ stones and bushes could be seen as soon as we were getting into the hamlet, that\
  \ was a paradisiac place. Images of peasants working on their farms made a beautiful\
  \ portrait.\nOnce I got off the train, at my very time there, I started to explore\
  \ the hamlet. during the exploration, I saw children playing and diving happily\
  \ into the clean waters of puddles and lakes of that place which was giving them\
  \ happiness. \nThe food there is very simple. It is made by few ingredients, some\
  \ of them have no need to be bought in markets because they are easily found at\
  \ the woods around the hamlet. Though they are very delicious. Some common dishes\
  \ there are: matapa (which is the famous one), baked fish, nhangana. I loved to\
  \ eat Matapa.\nDuring the little scramble around the hamlet I could soak so many\
  \ experiences given by locals. But during that time of experience exchanges, I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find a military barrack, that was being built by Chinese construction\
  \ companies, although it has been operating for decades.\nThe military barrack has\
  \ many soldiers with tanks around it. Though the peasants who live around are not\
  \ forbidden to crop their lands. It is normal to see people working there during\
  \ all the day, some even sleep there in order to maximize time, that just happens\
  \ during the week, except Wednesdays, because there is a military training, evolving\
  \ shooting.\nPeople who live in the village are dependent on the farms where they\
  \ produce their food for sustain. Despite the fact that they work for their sustain,\
  \ some peasants sell their maintenances in order to earn some money and avoid food\
  \ depreciation. By the time I was there, I noticed that a smile is often found on\
  \ their faces. \nPeople usually get up at five o\u2019clock to work as a way to\
  \ avoid working under the sun as the hamlet is very sunny. \nHandkerchief held in\
  \ women\xB4s head, capulana around their body with hoods on their hand or either\
  \ sieves containing cassava or other products produced in their farms are the characteristics\
  \ that define the women of this hamlet. \nThat makes the locals walk long distances\
  \ to find the public services. The hamlet is very simple, there are only farms,\
  \ bushes everywhere and some houses were built by some stakes and other simple or\
  \ precarious materials and they are usually covered by some typical bushes.\nAfter\
  \ almost one week in the hamlet, I thanked everyone who received and tried to explain\
  \ to some why I had to go because they were not accepting the fact that I had to\
  \ go. It was very funny to play with the locals and know them."
