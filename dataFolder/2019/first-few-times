Text: "I was born in Italy, but being black have always identified me as a foreigner,\
  \ an African. But I never felt that way, I have often thought that it was a negative\
  \ thing to be African because on Tv, at school, the adults (outside my family and\
  \ black community) said terrible things, that it was a Mainland in which there was\
  \ just: poverty, illnesses and death. \nTherefore, I\u2019ve always defended my\
  \ Italian belonging, also because I didn\u2019t know anything about Africa, just\
  \ Toto\u2019s song.  \n\u201CWhat\u2019s your country like?\u201D they asked me,\
  \ and I looked at them and I thought \u201Cit\u2019s not my land, I\u2019ve never\
  \ been there. Italy is! \u201C \nBut when I was twelve years old, something changed.\
  \  \nSummer of 2011, for the first time I have caught a train and I took a trip\
  \ of eight hours with my mother and my sister. The trip was hard, but also beautiful\
  \ because I had known so many people that travelled in my same direction for different\
  \ motives. However, I didn't know mine yet. \nI was so enthusiastic to breathe new\
  \ air, to walk in a new land, to see different people and to heard unknow languages.\
  \ \nOnce we had arrived my uncles had come to pick up us.  \nThat city was a discovery.\
  \  \nAnywhere I went I looked around and I was happy because I felt the love. There\
  \ were so many different cultures among them, but they pacifically cohabited. This\
  \ for the first time hasn\u2019t made me feel inappropriate. \nFor the first time\
  \ I heard Lingala, the language spoken by mother from people that they didn't have\
  \ African origins. I was so impressed. \nWhen I was at the park and I made friends,\
  \ they asked me from where I came and I responded Italia. And they replayed \u201C\
  you are Italian, that\u2019s beautiful! \u201C. No one ever told me you are African\
  \ and for the first time I\u2019ve felt approved for who I was an Italian child.\
  \  \nBut then spending many months there my point of view has changed. \nI\u2019\
  ve known different people and visited different districts but just one had marked\
  \ me: Chateau Rouge that is also known as the African heart of Paris. \nAt the beginning\
  \ I\u2019ve felt out place and confused. \nBut then something has happened in my\
  \ head and I started to feel like I really was in Africa, the distant and unknown\
  \ land.  \nI started to see colours and cloths that my eyes had never seen, to smell\
  \ perfumes and aromas that I didn't even think they existed. I also heard speaking\
  \ many languages that put together composed a musical sound. Many foods, cloths\
  \ and faces that I\u2019d seen in real life I\u2019d seen it on tv in the documentaries\
  \ and I was dumbfounded because I was there at that time and I was living everything\
  \ on my skin and not through a screen. \nI\u2019ve felt at home. That \u201Chome\u201D\
  \ that the others ones wanted give me, was mine. \nA small piece of Africa in that\
  \ great Paris, had made me feel African for the first time. There was a strong connection.\
  \ \nWhile before I was denying with every strength my origins, at that time I was\
  \ learning to appreciate it, to understand it and to assume awareness that I was\
  \ African and that there was a little part of Africa in me.  \nAs time goes by,\
  \ I\u2019ve understood that the trip that had been programmed only for visiting\
  \ a city and my uncles, revealed more. That journey has allowed me to discover and\
  \ accept myself for who I am. Honestly, I would never expected me to define Africa,\
  \ my Home and to feel like that.  \n \nNow:  \nPeople: \u201CAre your origins African?\u201D\
  \ \nMe: \"Yes, my roots are African and I\u2019m so proud of it\u201D"
