Text: "It was gratifying to tick a box off on the old bucket list. I wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ what it was, maybe the smoothness of the navy ink as it drifted over the slightly\
  \ crumpled paper, but it was completely satisfying to draw a line of completion\
  \ straight through the messy words I\u2019d written years before. Travel to Paphos.\
  \ Done and dusted! \nMaybe it wasn\u2019t so much as being in Paphos that was what\
  \ excited me. Perhaps it was the glorious tales of the mythical goddess who was\
  \ said to be born of the sea foam at Old Paphos. Aphrodite, the goddess of love.\
  \ Standing on the edge of the incline of rock that began on the white sandy shore,\
  \ staring out over the clear green sea to Aphrodite\u2019s Rock, I could almost\
  \ imagine the goddess herself sunning on top of her rock. \nI heard a squeal of\
  \ delight down by the lapping waves at the shore. \nA child and her parents were\
  \ spending a day at the beach. I could see the child frolick to and fro between\
  \ where her parents sat, smiling at her, and to the waves that gently kissed her\
  \ feet as she skipped in the salty spray of the water. Her parents sat hand in hand\
  \ as they gazed out tenderly at their daughter, basking in the ambience of one another\u2019\
  s company, not needing anything else. Just each other. \nMy fingers tightened around\
  \ the plastic tube of the pen. That terrible, green little monster was not my friend\
  \ but there he sat, mirthfully grinning on my shoulder as he forced me to ogle the\
  \ happy couple and their daughter. \nThere, at the very top of the bucket list,\
  \ yet to be scribbled out were three quite simple words that were anything but.\
  \ \nFall in love.\nAs I thought back to my twelve-year-old, apparent hopeless romantic\
  \ self, the only word that popped in my mind was \u2018moron\u2019. Did I think\
  \ I could simply stumble upon the man of my dreams and that would be it? Was I too\
  \ involved with fairytales of princes and princesses, or was my head filled with\
  \ happy endings that I watched in the romantic films?  \nI was an ignorant child,\
  \ that was for sure.\nFinally I willed myself to stop gawking at the happy family\
  \ down by the beach, shooed away the terrible feeling of jealousy and focused on\
  \ the picturesque view I had of the shining green ocean. Yet, as I stood there breathing\
  \ in the salty tang of the cool sea breeze, I thought my eyes were deceiving me.\
  \ \nA woman stood on top of the rock that shot up from the sea. She seemed to be\
  \ wearing a white sleeveless dress. A chiton, I think they were called. I couldn\u2019\
  t get an exact grip on what she looked like because, as crazy as it sounds, her\
  \ appearance changed. First she had golden blonde hair in ringlets, then it was\
  \ full chocolate brown curls, then it was a luscious mane of raven black wavy hair.\
  \ \nI thought maybe the sunlight reflecting from the water\u2019s surface was blinding\
  \ me, playing tricks with my vision to make it seem like this woman\u2019s appearance\
  \ changed to something more beautiful than the last. Then, almost painfully slowly,\
  \ she gracefully raised her arm in greeting. I copied her actions more timidly,\
  \ wriggling my fingers slowly, as if I was to make a hasty motion I would frighten\
  \ this woman off.\nA blinding beam of sunlight hit the water and shone right into\
  \ my line of vision. I covered my eyes to block out the searing light and stumbled\
  \ back. Of course, me being the clumsy person I am tripped on a small jagged rock\
  \ and fell back.\nI braced for impact but I was caught before my back could hit\
  \ the ground. \nMy breath hitched as hands wrapped around my waist and stopped me\
  \ from making a complete fool out of myself.\nI turned to thank my saviour but the\
  \ words caught in my throat. It was absolutely insane but there he was, and yes,\
  \ you know exactly who I\u2019m talking about. \nFunny, how we met at Aphrodite\u2019\
  s Rock. \nI could imagine her laughing just now."
