Text: "Warm\_light\_emanated from the tiny thatched roof cottage, along the narrow\
  \ trail running parallel to the rail tracks. An UNESCO World Heritage Site, The\
  \ Nilgiri Mountain Train, running 45 km is the slowest train in the country.\_Negotiating\_\
  the\_difficult\_terrains, we sped past meadows wet with dew, flocks of chirping\
  \ birds and wild trees that stood tall, kissing the clouds. Collective gasps reverberated\
  \ from the compartment as the train screeched and came to another halt.\n\nExhausted\
  \ by the long journey, I stared at the horizon, spellbound with the scenic beauty\
  \ of the valley. As my gaze drifted down, I was fascinated by a little cozy cottage\
  \ at the distance. A silhouette of a young lady emerged from the window; she was\
  \ staring into the void. The entire setting had an effortless poise, invoking a\
  \ burning curiosity to uncover every detail. When we finally reached Ooty later\
  \ in the evening, I was still caught up in my reverie. \n\nOverwhelmed with a strong\
  \ desire to visit the cottage, I set forth on a trip down the hill, a day after\
  \ arrival. Though I had my qualms, it wasn't an arduous task finding the cottage.\
  \ Glaring  at a fastened lock, I felt fatuous for driving all the way down when\
  \ my friends were spending the day cycling around the lake. Little flowers arched\
  \ the wooden doors and overgrown bushes gave the modest suburb an unruly look, a\
  \ distinct contrast to our holiday inn. Slowly backing away from the driveway, I\
  \ noticed a lady walk into the porch, firmly clutching a fruit basket under her\
  \ arms.\n\nIgnoring my prudence, I leapt out to meet the stranger; this wasn\u2019\
  t the lady from the train and it didn\u2019t take me long to grasp that. Discerning\
  \ her tear laden eyes, I asked what was bothering her. We walked to the market-place\
  \ where Anita owned a little fruit stall. Soon, she engaged in business, managing\
  \ to give me a reassuring smile when she couldn\u2019t help tearing up. Her interest\
  \ was piqued when I mentioned that evening but in an instant, she changed to a melancholic\
  \ look.\n\n\u201CShe is dead,\u201D she said, her tone calm and measured. \n\nThe\
  \ woman in the cottage was her daughter and I must have taken note of her when she\
  \ was contemplating suicide. She had fallen in love with a boy from Kothagiri but\
  \ their romantic relationship had infuriated the boy\u2019s family so much that\
  \ the young couple hiked all the way to Doda Petta (the fourth highest peak in South\
  \ India) on that fateful day and plunged to their demise, with arms locked in embrace,\
  \ hoping to escape the hostility of the material world and unite in another. While\
  \ we are marching on the streets for progressive reforms, lives are still being\
  \ lost. Homosexuality was yet to be legalized in the country but what role do legislations\
  \ play when casualties occur either way, I pondered.\n\nRealising it was only a\
  \ day after the tragedy, I wondered why she was working. Despite having had close\
  \ encounters with grief and mortality, I felt a spine-tingling chill at her response.\n\
  \u201COh, grieving is an indulgence not everybody can afford. If and when they find\
  \ my daughter\u2019s remains, I need to give her a fitting farewell.\u201D Death\
  \ rituals have always bugged me but I fathomed that it might be the only way for\
  \ the living to find the closure they desperately need.\n\nWith the orange Sun setting\
  \ over the horizon and the cold November wind gently blowing, the cottage looked\
  \ like an exquisite art-piece adorning the walls of an art gallery. But everything\
  \ has changed in a day. After paying homage, I fished out some cash from my wallet\
  \ and pleaded with Anita to accept my contribution for her daughter\u2019s funeral\
  \ services.\n\n\u2018500Rs and 1000Rs BANNED\u2019 flashed the news bulletin on\
  \ my 64\u201D flat screen. Vaguely, I remembered handing Anita the currency that\
  \ was now banned. New legislations are made everyday. My thoughts stayed with Anita\
  \ as the country tussled with demonetisation. \u201CI\u2019ll do the suturing,\u201D\
  \ I said, returning back to my work at the casualty, remembering that the act of\
  \ grieving is an indulgence some cannot afford."
