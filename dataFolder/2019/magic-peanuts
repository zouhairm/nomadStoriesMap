Text: "The warm stone slab provided comfort as I sat soaking up the early afternoon\
  \ sun in the center of the vast cobblestone plaza at the heart of San Crist\xF3\
  bal de las Casas. Perched at over 7,000 feet, this colonial city is the commercial\
  \ and cultural hub of the highlands of Chiapas in southern Mexico. The crisp mountain\
  \ air was pierced by the shrill cries of a few scattered children and the call of\
  \ an approaching peanut vendor, whose heavy buckets were slung from a pole balanced\
  \ on his shoulders. Behind him, the Baroque facade of the cathedral rose up like\
  \ a fairyland castle decked in creamy whites and yellows.\n\nA man seated nearby\
  \ broke into my reverie with a comment on the weather. He seemed eager to talk and\
  \ we embarked on an extensive conversation about the places I had visited. I described\
  \ the vivid colors of the crystalline waters and coral reefs along the Yucatan coastline.\
  \ I recounted my trek through the steamy silence of the Lacondon jungle, where only\
  \ a few ruined temples of the Mayan city of Palenque have been wrested back from\
  \ the all-consuming force of nature. I responded to his inquiries and he drank in\
  \ every detail until finally, his curiosity sated, the questions ceased altogether\
  \ and we sat for a moment in silence. Why, he wondered at last, and not without\
  \ a trace of bitterness in his voice, couldn\u2019t he hop on a plane and tour the\
  \ US just as I had so recently done in his country.  \n\nBy now the peanut vendor\
  \ had made his way to my side. Being the only gringa in the plaza, his sights were\
  \ set on me. When I explained that I was recovering from a nasty encounter with\
  \ Salmonella he instantly burst into a litany of health benefits that his product\
  \ would deliver. They are good for digestion, aid the liver, cleanse the kidneys,\
  \ purify the blood, heal the heart, help anything that ails you, he rambled on and\
  \ handed me a warm peanut to sample. As the claims became more preposterous, the\
  \ half a dozen or so people gathered around began laughing and pummeling him with\
  \ questions. What about arthritis, rheumatism? \n\n\u201CWill they help me win the\
  \ lottery?\u201D I asked. Laughter exploded from the group and the vendor hung his\
  \ head. Not meaning to offend, I casually inquired the price. Ten pesos.\n\n\u201C\
  Ten pesos! They must be magic peanuts!\u201D\n\nA few heads turned back to private\
  \ conversations, embarrassed by this blatant price gouging of an unsuspecting tourist.\
  \ I slipped my hand into my pocket and squinted as sunlight glanced off the lone\
  \ 10-peso coin in my palm. Without further discussion, I passed it to the wide-eyed\
  \ vendor who hastily handed me a cone of tightly rolled newsprint brimming with\
  \ roasted peanuts before moving off to the far side of the plaza.\n\nI turned back\
  \ to my new-found friend, who had been silent during the proceedings, and asked\
  \ how much he would have paid. \u201COne or two pesos, right?\u201D He nodded in\
  \ disbelief. \u201CWhy\u201D he continued his questioning, \u201Cdid you give him\
  \ ten pesos when you knew it only cost two?\u201D  I paused as I contemplated this\
  \ for a moment. \n\n\u201CPorque puedo\u201D I responded. Because I can.\n\nI finally\
  \ grasped what he had been hinting at earlier- my privileged status. The power of\
  \ the purse that I yielded because of the country of my birth, my unexamined expectations\
  \ that another nation would welcome me open-armed, my right to life, liberty, and\
  \ the pursuit of happiness.  \n\nWe parted ways and I returned to my room and unwrapped\
  \ the precious cargo from its paper cone. I made a wish, cracked open and ate one\
  \ of the peanuts, then laid down to rest. Thinking back on our conversation, I realized\
  \ that despite our many differences, what we had in common was the freedom to believe\
  \ whatever we chose. I knew that if I really believed it, these magic peanuts could\
  \ do all that the vendor claimed and more. They would help me heal. For the price\
  \ I had paid, I knew that I had been the one to snag the deal of the century!"
