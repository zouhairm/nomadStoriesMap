Text: "It was my greatest pleasure to attend the 67th Annual Cannes Film Festival\
  \ in 2014.  In fact, it was my first time to witness amazing world premiere films\
  \ and explore the beautiful Palais des Festivals that stretched across French Riviera.\
  \ I even shared the red carpet with Frida Pinto, who briefly chatted with me about\
  \ her gorgeous magenta Oscar De La Renta gown!  On a high of cinema (and my celebrity\
  \ run-in), I couldn't wait to see old friends and enjoy my favorite city in the\
  \ entire world, Paris.\n\nAfter a grueling road trip of 10hrs from Cannes to Paris,\
  \ I hopped on the metro - one the most efficient ways to travel throughout the city!\
  \  Though I was extremely tired, I couldn't help but notice the handsome young man\
  \ catching glances at me.  I smiled from across the train and he reciprocated. \
  \ Paris, truly a city of love!  \n\nTo my happy surprise, we shared the same metro\
  \ stop.  He smiled again and let me go ahead of him to exit (such a gentleman).\
  \  I couldn't help but smile from ear to ear when a German couple approached me\
  \ and told me that the same man took something out of my backpack. It was cell phone.\
  \  My lifeline to everything abroad. \n\nFull of anxiety, I tried to figure out\
  \ where I was in order to report the incident to the police.  Lo and behold, my\
  \ handsome thief was sitting at the bus stop!  I approached him telling him I wanted\
  \ my phone back.  He pretended he didn't speak English.  I kept repeating \"give\
  \ me my phone back,\" louder and louder until he started to run.  I chased him down\
  \ (with all my luggage in tow) and yelling/demanding about my phone, until he got\
  \ on a bus.... TRAPPED.  Finally, he was shamed into giving my phone back stating\
  \ \"here it is, okay?\"  I couldn't help but think, man, he's too cute to be a pick\
  \ pocket. \n\nOh well, I got in a taxi and went go to Jim Haynes' famous Sunday\
  \ Supper party.  Jim holds his weekly dinner soir\xE9es on Sundays at his beautiful\
  \ 3-story home, once a sculptors' studio, in the 14th arrondissement.  After a free\
  \ delicious meal (I donated my share afterwards, but I hear now that one reserves\
  \ a dinner spot for 30 Euros), I randomly ran into an old classmate from college\
  \ who I haven't seen in over 7 years!  What a day, what a day...  This is only one\
  \ of the reasons why Paris is still my favorite city in the world."
