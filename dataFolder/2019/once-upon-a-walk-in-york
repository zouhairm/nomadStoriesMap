Text: "I walk down a street. The shops crowd in, the aroma of freshly-baked bread\
  \ lingers around me. People bustle by \u2014 I look up to a sign that reads, \u201C\
  Gillygate\u201D. \n\nI am in York. The city that was once a Roman stronghold only\
  \ to later become a tangible reminder of Viking victory. But today, York is a cultural\
  \ heritage, a national treasure trove of the English past.\n\nAs I step around a\
  \ corner, I'm stopped in my tracks by a magnificently enormous Gothic cathedral\
  \ \u2014 the York Minster. It is impossible not to gasp in awe; the structure instils\
  \ a yearning to worship. Slightly beyond the Minster\u2019s north fa\xE7ade is a\
  \ statue of Emperor Constantine, forever carved in a pose of fluid ease, comfortable\
  \ on his throne, one hand caressing a sword. A plethora of winding streets encompass\
  \ the Minster. \n\nI wander around and arrive at the mouth of a narrow cobbled road,\
  \ with uneven buildings leaning into each other. This is The Shambles, one of the\
  \ oldest streets in York. It staunchly weaves its way through the modern mayhem.\n\
  \nAs I leave the alley, I climb up to an ancient, but charming Roman wall. It is\
  \ one among many that pulses through the city. A walk along it provides a panoramic\
  \ view of the sights beneath. The river Ouse expands placidly, sparkling beneath\
  \ bridges, rowing enthusiasts speckled along it.\n\nYork awaits the earnest explorer,\
  \ the history buff, the true artist, the persistent reader, the pensive worshipper,\
  \ the indulgent foodie, the unapologetic wild child. There are several churches,\
  \ bookshops, galleries, theatres, bakeries, chocolatiers, and a Roman bath to visit.\
  \ There are even 366 pubs to entice a fancy for fun (every single day of the year,\
  \ leaps included). \n\nBut for now, I am content to explore its streets. To window-shop\
  \ and listen to the calming cacophony of local life. To get lost amidst the wonderful\
  \ motions of this fascinating Yorkshire city. \n\nI walk down yet another unmarked\
  \ lane, assured that the Minster \u2014 looming with splendour in the background\
  \ \u2014 will lead me back to a familiar path."
