Text: "I am a post graduating student and this is the best opportunity for me to express\
  \ myself and showcase my talent on international level.\n\nSo I begin with that\
  \ as if I am a student who like to travel the world but in reality have no money.\
  \ Also parents are quite conservative and won't allow me to travel in a stranger\
  \ world. So I ran off to achieve my dream with having a thought in my mind that\
  \ I am going to write a book which will be published and from then I am about to\
  \ start living my best life doing everything I want from singing to traveling the\
  \ world from sky diving to scuba diving.. I will achieve every single thing that\
  \ I have thought of doing it. And when I came back my parents would be more than\
  \ proud of myself and then I will make them travel 'chaar dham yatra' a famous and\
  \ religious traveling to some religious places within India. Also I had made a good\
  \ friend there in portugal whom with I am going to travel every other city that\
  \ I dreamed of. \n\nThis is my real story and I just need a chance to fly and this\
  \ could be that chance.\nThankyou."
