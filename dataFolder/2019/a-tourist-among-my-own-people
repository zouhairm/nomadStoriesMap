Text: "Two weeks going into my  college break, my dad receive a news from a family\
  \ member that his uncle had died. So we had to go there, I don\u2019t actually know\
  \ why they had to bring me with them, because frankly I don\u2019t like going to\
  \ that sort of stuff. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love going to my dad\u2019s hometown,\
  \ it\u2019s a beautiful very small town with a  nice cold temperature very different\
  \ from than the city I live in, and the scenery of mountains surrounding you in\
  \ a  very nurturing ways. No, It\u2019s not the place, it\u2019s the traditional\
  \ ritual of Batak people on celebrating death and yes you don\u2019t hear me wrong,\
  \ my people or Batak people do celebrate the mostly hated event that is death, especially\
  \ if the deceased is old enough to be someone\u2019s grandparent. I know it\u2019\
  s weird , but so does celebrating thanksgiving in October if you\u2019re Canadian\
  \ seen by American. \nSo we arrived in Balige, a small town near the largest crater\
  \ lake of South East Asia that is Lake Toba or \u201CDanau Toba\u201D where my dad\u2019\
  s hometown is just one and a half hour ride from the  town.  \nWhen we finally went\
  \ to the mourning family\u2019s house, I can see smiling faces of moms chatting\
  \ while preparing food for the guests in the yard, and dad\u2019s drinking traditional\
  \ Batak liquor or \u201CTuak\u201D and children running around. Just a regular family\
  \ gathering even, not at all seems partying as I was expected.\nTurns out we just\
  \ arrived to early .\n\tAs the event about to start, I see trucks arriving and started\
  \ unloading both traditional and fairly modern musical instruments, and dancers\
  \ with traditional batak clothing with a tall pointy hat and traditional scarf or\
  \ \u201Culos\u201D getting in position. And people started coming one by one, I\
  \ felt a slight anxiety when the crowd of \u201Cguests\u2019 starting to form and\
  \ to make things worst I couldn\u2019t find my mom or dad.  \nI was traped.\nI couldn\u2019\
  t find my way out. The music was loud and I can\u2019t even hear my self thinking\
  \ of a way out. I just stood there, while people dancing and talking and texting\
  \ (\u201Cwhich I don\u2019t even know hot it is possible to text in there\u201D\
  ). As the Newton\u2019s third law said \u201C: For every action, there is an equal\
  \ and opposite reaction\u201D And my reaction was drifting outside the crowd to\
  \ the road.\nI finally gets out.\nI sit under a sap tree not to far outside, observing\
  \ more and more people started coming, only now it\u2019s a bunch of mom\u2019s,\
  \ young and old with a tall bag of rice on their head as a form of help to the grieving\
  \ family. And guest what? they started dancing again, only this time the children\
  \ of the deceased dance their way out of the house parading the coffin with the\
  \ lead of the professional traditional dancers. As the closest relatives place the\
  \ coffin in front of the crowd they started to form a quarter of  circle and the\
  \ crowd of people started to dance their way around the coffin with the traditional\
  \ dance \u201Ctor-tor\u201D where the closest relatives move their hands up and\
  \ down like the opposite of \u201Casereje\u201D dance while the guest circling around\
  \ and slipping money to the families  hands as a form of respect to the deceased.\
  \ And it went over and over again like that for hours before the ceremonies was\
  \ done.\nI managed to find my mom and soon enough my dad. We were on our way back\
  \ to  the hotel, and I told them how much I dislike the ceremony carefully not to\
  \ mention how much I despise it. And i remember exactly what my mom said to me,\
  \ \u201CNeither do I, I hate every parts of it, but it\u2019s my obligation as a\
  \ daughter of Batak People to prevent our traditional way of life from vanishing\
  \ into oblivion\u201D. \nI never thought of going back to my people\u2019s hometown\
  \ to get a glimpse of what I want to be in the future, but at the end I know what\
  \ I don\u2019t  want to be, that is a tourist among my own people\u201D."
