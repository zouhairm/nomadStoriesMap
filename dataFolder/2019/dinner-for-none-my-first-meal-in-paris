Text: "\u201CDinner for None: My First Meal in Paris\u201D\n\nHindsight: it can be\
  \ brutal. In all my years roaming the globe, I can honestly say that I regret nothing.\
  \ However, given the opportunity to do so, there are certain things that I would\
  \ have done differently. Very differently. Mainly, Paris. Though beautiful it may\
  \ be, Paris can be daunting, even intimidating to the uninitiated, and that\u2019\
  s just what I was: uninitiated. In fact, I made almost every conceivable mistake\
  \ a first-time traveler could make. But of all my grand Parisian transgressions,\
  \ the one that haunts me still to this day? My first meal.\n\nWhen the plane touched\
  \ down, I\u2019d been awake for nearly twenty-two hours. A combination of adrenaline\
  \ and some seriously questionable airplane food had me in a state of starvation.\
  \ I exited the airport terminal, got in a cab and was en route to my flat. It didn\u2019\
  t take long to exhaust my grade-nine comprehension of the French language, so I\
  \ sat in silence, watching eagerly out the window as we drove. Sprawling Gothic\
  \ architecture and quaint picturesque cafes whizzed by in a beautiful blur. The\
  \ car began to slow as we approached the address and finally came to a halt. I couldn't\
  \ contain my excitement - I\u2019d officially arrived in Paris!\n\nAfter bringing\
  \ my belongings inside, I headed out for a bite to eat - wearing the exact clothes\
  \ I\u2019d worn on the plane. My appearance and hygiene were suspect at best but\
  \ I didn\u2019t care. The shower could wait, my stomach would not. I wandered aimlessly\
  \ for a few blocks until I saw a warm yellow light spilling out into the street;\
  \ I removed my ball-cap and stepped inside.\n\nJudging by the decor, clientele,\
  \ and overall ambiance, I realized almost immediately that I\u2019d stumbled into\
  \ a fine-dining restaurant. One that I likely couldn\u2019t afford. Furthermore,\
  \ my tragic ensemble consisted of a stained Batman t-shirt, frayed blue jeans, and\
  \ sneakers. I wasn\u2019t expecting a warm welcome. Much to my surprise, that's\
  \ precisely what I received. The server greeted me with a friendly, if not slightly\
  \ hesitant \u201Cbonjour\u201D and escorted me to a table in the corner of the restaurant.\n\
  \nSkimming the menu confirmed my cost assumptions - I could not afford to eat here.\
  \ I began reading the price of the dish, rather than the item description: whatever\
  \ item was the cheapest would be my dinner for that evening. Luckily, it was even\
  \ something that I recognized (or so I thought) - fish and chips! I proudly proclaimed\
  \ my order - in my best French accent - and waited for my server to return. Much\
  \ to my chagrin, he wasn\u2019t carrying fish and chips.\n\nIn his hands instead\
  \ was a large French Oven. I feigned a smile trying to hide my surprise, and he\
  \ returned my greeting with a \u201Cbon app\xE9tit!\u201D I sat frozen staring at\
  \ the dish, a paralysis comprised of equal parts: anger and fear. It took a few\
  \ minutes before I finally mustered the courage to lift the lid; my heart sank at\
  \ the sight. What I\u2019d presumed to be \u201Cfish and chips\u201D was in fact\
  \ \u201Ccodfish soup\u201D: complete with leeks, diced carrots, and chunks of raw\
  \ cod floating throughout. Oh, and it was ice-cold too.\n\nI wanted to cry. Famished\
  \ as I was, I simply could not bring myself to eat this cold-cod-concoction. I started\
  \ flailing my arms in the air like a castaway in dire need of rescue. My server\
  \ was confused and my poor attempt at \u201CFranglais\u201D just made matters worse.\
  \ He pieced together the broken bumbling recounting of my mistake, only to inform\
  \ me that the kitchen was now shut down for the night! J\u2019ai triste!\n\nMy despair\
  \ hung heavily walking home that evening. I was exhausted, defeated, and still starving\
  \ beyond all measure. Back at the flat, I scoured the cupboards for the tiniest\
  \ morsel of food but found nothing. As I lay awake to the sounds of my stomach slowly\
  \ eating itself, I knew two things with absolute certainty. First, I would never\
  \ again be too afraid or too proud to ask for help. Second and most importantly\
  \ - I'd never order \u201Cfish and chips\u201D in a restaurant ever again."
