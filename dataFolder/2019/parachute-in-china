Text: "Parachute in China\n\nOne of the things I've never had the courage and will\
  \ in my life, was parachute jumping. Less still dropping from parachutes without\
  \ even using them. I explain. On a trip to China, my beloved godmother on her 3rd\
  \ day touring the country, she was struck by a strong pancreatitis that nearly stolen\
  \ her life. A week later I arrived in Beijing to help her. I literally fell into\
  \ a parachute in this country that was previously completely unknown to me.\n15\
  \ days later she would return home and I would begin my adventure through this country\
  \ of products fakes, zillions of bicycles and that people who spits and pajamas\
  \ down the street as if they were at home. I discovered a local agency and after\
  \ my 3rd trip to LA, I finally closed a 20-day package across the country. Just\
  \ as I speak neither Greek nor Hungarian, the less Chinese still speak English.\
  \ I had to use my creativity and remember the beautiful Saturday afternoons that\
  \ I played mimic with friends. With mime I learned to find a direction, to know\
  \ where the bathroom was, and even to eat a simple meal. With mimicry I spent these\
  \ beautiful days in this boiling country.\nYears ago I had seen a movie that would\
  \ become one of my favorites, called \"Red Lanterns.\" Searching, I discovered that\
  \ it had been shot in Ping Yao. Ping Yao, where my story happens.\nI explain. My\
  \ comings and goings to the local travel agency was to understand and be understood,\
  \ because even though it was a travel agency, the Chinese insisted on not speaking\
  \ English, but from what little I could understand, was that I would have a guide\
  \ waiting for me at each and that he himself would take me to my hotel and give\
  \ me directions to the next destination. And so it was. In every city there was\
  \ my smiling and happy guide to put, or try to put into practice, his English classes.\
  \ And every day I become an expert in mime !!!! Ping Yao was the next destination.\
  \ My guide from the previous site instructed me that I would take about 2 hours\
  \ inside a bus and that I should jump only at the final point, where someone from\
  \ my hotel would pick me up. When it was about 15 minutes (2 hours to reach) I notice\
  \ that the bus stops, a tall, strong, ugly Chinese enters and everyone on the bus\
  \ stops and looks at me. Immediately I thought: \"We have come and come to get me.\
  \ Ping Yao is located in Shanxi about 715km from Beijing, and is world heritage\
  \ of mankind and as such, is surrounded by typical and tumbled casar\xEDos, with\
  \ streets and narrow lanes and closed to the heavy vehicles.\nMy tall, strong and\
  \ ugly Chines came from golf cart to get me. After about 5 minutes, he stops, jumps\
  \ and mimes me asking for several Yuan. That's where my heart started to beat faster,\
  \ my hand started to sweat, and I literally started to freak out. I should not have\
  \ paid anything because everything was paid for ... I should not have jumped there\
  \ let alone have entered the golf cart of my tall, strong, ugly Chinese. It was\
  \ a trap, one of catching tourists. No way out, I had to pay my Chinese high, strong\
  \ and ugly and fall literally but this time in tears. Besides having lost money,\
  \ I had no idea where my hotel was, let alone how I would continue my trip from\
  \ there. What I had was just the agency's phone in Beijing. At that time I did not\
  \ travel with a cell phone and already wanted to kill myself, I entered a desperate\
  \ shop, in tears and seeing that the owner spoke on the phone and luckily that yes\
  \ seemed to understand my words, I asked him to call the travel agency.\nAnd so\
  \ I arrived at my hotel. A sweet Chinese girl at the reception came to greet me,\
  \ and I believe she still has no idea what really happened to me. Not even with\
  \ mimicry would she understand me."
