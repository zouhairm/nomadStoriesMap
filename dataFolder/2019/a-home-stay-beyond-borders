Text: "The stretch up the hill demanded more trudging than my lungs could merit, but\
  \ here I was challenged by a woman at least eight years older. My Ego had no choice\
  \ but to over-compensate my weak knees with some artificial manhood. The Nepalese\
  \ hills in the capital city of Kathmandu had an aura of the spiritual mountains\
  \ of India. There were Gods all around. There was the temple of Shiva the destroyer,\
  \ Vishnu the Preserver and The Buddha atop different hills. These rocky terrains\
  \ embodied a subtle grace, powerful enough to wane away my fragile high self -image.\
  \ It was my second day in Nepal. Pushpa my friend cum guide was sharp like a squirrel\
  \ and playful like a parakeet. A day before, an inadvertent flight disruption by\
  \ the erratic Maoist insurgency had cost me a cancellation and three more days of\
  \ stay in Nepal than originally planned.   \n\nThe previous week had been particularly\
  \ exciting. The birthplace of The Buddha had mesmerized me. The maroon-robed monks,\
  \ the endless stretch of land in the Lumbini forests and the colossal pagodas of\
  \ different countries in a single premise were a sight worth beholding.  I had no\
  \ more than a day's plan to put up in Kathmandu, but fate had it. I had to meet\
  \ Pushpa and hear her story. \n\nPushpa was warm as a person but brutally professional\
  \ as well. She drank beer like water and never was dizzy. She made really bad tea\
  \ though.  I wouldn't mind her bad tea, for she compensated that with tonnes of\
  \ genuine smiles and ever ready helpfulness. It was our second day of knowing each\
  \ other. Pushpa happened to me by accident, looking for cheap accommodation I stumbled\
  \ upon her homestay.  It fitted my budget. The first evening chit-chats revealed\
  \ how this beautiful woman in her late thirties had journeyed her way from activism\
  \ to entrepreneurship. It was a wintry night of December 2012, the whole country\
  \ was jolted by a brutal gang-rape and murder of a young woman. From busy streets\
  \ to parliament, protests and slogans rocked the socio-political life of the whole\
  \ country. Pushpa was at the forefront of one of these protests, her angry self\
  \ couldn't fathom the heinousness of the crime. Her blood boiled, her soul restless.\
  \ As thousands screamed and cried Pushpa did her human part. But deep in her heart,\
  \ she knew revolution won't bring change. Only consistent enterprise will.  Women\
  \ needed jobs and self-reliance. Only that would boost their social status and make\
  \ them less vulnerable. \n\nAs she spoke her eyes would go from dismay to anger\
  \ to hopefulness. Her accent was awkward and cute at the same time. She spoke broken\
  \ Hindi and almost fluent English. The tiring day, had me half drifted to sleep\
  \ but she would barely realize and speak relentlessly of all things that made her,\
  \ her. We were an instant connect. We exemplified what is called opposites attract.\
  \ She was a non-stop chatterbox, I was an occasional hummer.  I had always been\
  \ a good listener but this was different. I had a whole lot more respect for her\
  \ struggle and her grit than just empathetic listening.  I don't remember when I\
  \ slipped to sleep. \n\nThe next dawn was about to bring my journey in Nepal to\
  \ an end. Though highly thoughtless and non-creative I tried my bit at saying thank\
  \ to Pushpa in my own insufficient ways.  I went out early to the market place to\
  \ buy a scarf for her.  She had donned just one old scarf all three days, I assumed\
  \ she would appreciate getting a new one. I was relieved she liked it and instantly\
  \ wore it also. She looked cuter than ever. \n\nThe intertwined lives of hosts and\
  \ guests have a bizarre but a subtle string running through. On most occasions,\
  \ it remains untouched. But when connections build up they can take you through\
  \ realms of magic. The satisfaction of connecting with another human from a different\
  \ world, where you pour your heart out or be the one who can take a heartful of\
  \ touching stories. \n\nI bid her a cold goodbye, hiding my warmth behind a coarse\
  \ male voice and expressionless dry eyes. Yet, she saw it all."
