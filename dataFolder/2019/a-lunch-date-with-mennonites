Text: "She had hands that spanned over the size of her brother\u2019s freckled face\
  \ and her feet spread out as wide as the plain plastic plates she was setting the\
  \ table with. To say Annie, an 18-year-old Mennonite, was tall would be an understatement.\
  \ While she towered over her two siblings, eight-year-old Benjamin and three-year-old\
  \ Peter, I could get a sense of her behemoth size. \n\nWe first met Annie\u2019\
  s father, Gerhard Andr\xE9s two weeks earlier on a personal challenge to hitchhike\
  \ across Belize in a day, accomplished in only seven rides and two torrential downpours.\
  \ It was our first encounter with a Mennonite and not knowing much about these elusive\
  \ people, an invitation to visit his family for lunch at their colony was something\
  \ we could not decline. \n\nMennonites started arriving to Belize from Mexico in\
  \ 1958, creating one of the largest colonies, Shipyard. Originally settlers from\
  \ the earliest colony in Chortiza (part of the Russian empire and now Ukraine),\
  \ they moved to Canada in the 1870s in search for the ideal place to live in line\
  \ with their religious beliefs. Primarily based on the separation of the church\
  \ and the state, they lived there without government interference and were self-sustainable\
  \ from farming. However, in 1922 Canada began constructing public schools in Mennonite\
  \ settlements and made attendance compulsory by law, meaning the study of their\
  \ bible was prohibited. As an effect, the colonies dispersed southwards to Mexico\
  \ and then into Belize.\n\nGerhard grew up in Shipyard and met his wife Margarita.\
  \ They now live opposite his old family home, a straight wood panelled house, singed\
  \ in a charcoal black. \u201CWe had a fire a few years back, but my father still\
  \ lives there\u201D, Gerhard explained. \n\nEn route to Shipyard we were ashamed\
  \ to be overtaken by families riding horses and buggies. The road was nothing but\
  \ a resemblance of a mud-ridden mine field and our 4x4 could not cope. We were far\
  \ from the luxury of a tarmac highway, in a land where maintenance and advanced\
  \ technology were a thing of the future. \n\n\u201CSo you don\u2019t work Saturdays?\u201D\
  \ questioned Annie. She was now hanging out nine pairs of denim jeans along a thin\
  \ rope that quivered with the weight of the load. Only easing slightly each time\
  \ a drop of water fell from the saturated hems. You could see that they all belonged\
  \ to one man. Identical oil stained handprints were pressed into the thigh region,\
  \ an indicator of where her father must wipe off the mess each time. \n\n\u201C\
  We make our own clothes and get to pick what patterns we want\u201D, Annie announced\
  \ in broken English. The dress she filled was a simple cut that nipped in at the\
  \ waist and flowed well below the knee, with bulging shoulder pads that only enhanced\
  \ her Mennonite-like width. Purple and blue flowers screamed for attention beneath\
  \ a pitch black material. \n\nLunch was served at the unusual time of 11:30, although\
  \ this wasn\u2019t the most peculiar part of our visit. Gerhard recited a blessing\
  \ in Low German that lasted over 2 minutes and long enough for the chicken broth\
  \ to go tepid, a relief in this mid-morning heat. The house was bare, with lime\
  \ green walls and a floor that shone like patent leather - must be from the women\
  \ mopping the floor each Saturday, I thought. We were sat around a mahogany table,\
  \ the grandest ornament there, all perched on matching wooden benches. \u201CAmen\u201D\
  \ was our cue and everyone surged towards the homemade bread buns, made with milk\
  \ and not water, scooping up the salty soup and picking out sorrel leaves that were\
  \ added for extra flavour. \n\nBefore we left, earlier than anticipated, we asked\
  \ the family if we could take a photo. Immediately you could see they were unaccustomed\
  \ to having their image being permanently recorded. Their fists were clenched and\
  \ their toes peeled off the floor to make sure they weren\u2019t anchored in the\
  \ same position for very long. Their horizontal smiles, wedged noses and stiff stance\
  \ made for an uncomfortable portrait. Using Annie\u2019s previous question as an\
  \ excuse to leave, we let them get on with their working Saturday and thanked them\
  \ for their hospitality."
