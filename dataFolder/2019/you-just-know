Text: "I slowly awoke from a quiet, peaceful sleep as my iPhone vibrated on my pillow.\
  \ I rolled over and felt around for it. It was time and I was ready! This was it,\
  \ this was the adventure, this was my adventure. I laced up my hiking boots, pulled\
  \ my hair into a ponytail, grabbed a beanie, unplugged my camera from the New Zealand\
  \ to US adapted, and was ready to go.\n\n\nI was on a self assigned quest. I wanted\
  \ that perfect shot, the one that speaks to the person looking at it. I wanted it,\
  \ I needed it, and I was going to get it!\n\nI walked into the lobby, filled my\
  \ coffee mug, and waited for my friend, Christine. I anxiously picked at my cuticles\
  \  and unlocked my phone. The lady, behind the counter, must have noticed I was\
  \ anxious and decided to start a conversation. She asked, \u201CWhat are your plans\
  \ for today?\u201D I responded, \u201CGoing on an adv\u2026 a hike!\u201D I quickly\
  \ changed adventure to hike because I was in New Zealand and every time I said adventure,\
  \ I sounded like I was quoting Lord of the Rings. \n\nCarrying on the conversation,\
  \ she asked, \u201CWhere are you going?\u201D I didn\u2019t really have an answer.\
  \ I stood there for a moment and then explained, \u201CI\u2019ll know when I get\
  \ there. I\u2019ll know that\u2019s where I\u2019m supposed to be. Everything will\
  \ tell a story. Aren\u2019t those the best kind of adventures?\u201D  She gave me\
  \ the biggest smile, wished me luck, and continued with her work. \n\nMy friend\u2019\
  s lack of motivation for punctuality provided me with time to ponder the previous\
  \ conversation. I was lucky enough to begin traveling internationally, when I was\
  \ 16, however, no one in my family has ever left the country. So, at 16, I put my\
  \ camera around my neck, and traveled through Europe for three weeks. I took hundreds\
  \ of pictures, and came home with countless stories to tell. This was when my love\
  \ and passion for photography and travel blogging began. \n\nThose are always the\
  \ best adventures. The ones you weren\u2019t expecting to experience. The ones where\
  \ your expectations were nonexistent, and then all of a sudden, those moments become\
  \ what you hold all future adventures up against. The moments that take your breath\
  \ away, just for a second, but that second becomes a lifetime of stories, and memories.\
  \ It becomes the image you see when you close your eyes. \n\nBefore I could finish\
  \ my thought, the elevator door opened and Christine stepped out. My adventure for\
  \ the picture worth a thousand words had begun. \n\nWe parked the car. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure which way to walk. However, faking it until I make it has always been a talent\
  \ of mine. I put my beanie on, exited the car, and marched forward like I had constructed\
  \ this trail with my own two hands. \n\nWe reached a spot where the trail disappeared.\
  \ An entrance to a path laid to our left. It was covered by trees, and I almost\
  \ missed it. As I scanned the area, a beam of light peaked through the trees and\
  \ lit up the pathway, as if screaming an invitation. I followed the pathway to a\
  \ clearing, and as I looked out, I lost my breath. My mind went completely blank\
  \ as I looked out at the magnificent forest before my eyes. \n\nThe canopy hung\
  \ over my head, as I gazed out at the different shades of green that laid beneath\
  \ us. I closed my eyes and listened. I listened to the sound of the water, I listened\
  \ to the quiet songs of birds in the distance, and I listened to my own breath.\
  \ I listened. \n\nI opened my eyes, just as the rays from the sun came shooting\
  \ through the clouds. They danced through the sky. They reflected off the water\
  \ on the leaves, and they illuminated the sky. I had the shot. I had my place. I\
  \ painted a mental picture, knowing how incredibly lucky I was to live this life\
  \ and be able to bring pictures and stories to people who deserve to live in these\
  \ moments with me."
