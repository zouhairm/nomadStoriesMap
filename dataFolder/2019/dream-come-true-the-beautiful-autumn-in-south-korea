  \ true. i had a chance travelling and enjoyed the autumn season. I was feel like\
  \ i never expected that i could travelling in a country i was dreaming about. \n\
  \nI come from a small village, ordinary girl and come from the farmer family. but,\
  \ through my travelling dream thats really open my mind that even i come from a\
  \ really village its doesnt mean i can't reach my dream and through my travelling\
  \ dream i feel like i want to build to connection with the people around the world.\

  \ my brain was feeling so fresh. thats actually just short Journey, although that\
  \ was short journey but i dont want lost  my beautiful memory that maybe i cant\
