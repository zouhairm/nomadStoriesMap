Text: "\u201CI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve heard of this place, it\u2019s this city\
  \ called Dumaguete which is about an hour flight south of Manila.\u201D This is\
  \ how I often respond to people that ask me, \u201Cwhereabouts in the Philippines\
  \ are you from?\u201D. This is also frequently followed by another question that\
  \ I have struggled to answer for the longest time which is, \u201Cwhat\u2019s it\
  \ like where you\u2019re from?\u201D Over time, I have become used to the confused\
  \ look on people\u2019s faces as they wonder where this place is, what it\u2019\
  s like and how to pronounce Dumaguete. It was only once that someone in my eight\
  \ years of living overseas that someone knew where my hometown is located and let\
  \ alone visited the place. What initially felt like an interrogation eventually\
  \ became a brief conversation about an immigration officer\u2019s excitement in\
  \ recounting his experience visiting Dumaguete as well as the neighboring island,\
  \ Siquijor. It was this moment at London Heathrow that is often at the back of my\
  \ mind as I explore this small seaside town. I, therefore, begin to plan what I\
  \ want to say when I am asked these questions as I explore my hometown. \n\nHaving\
  \ spent the last eight years studying overseas, every time I came home to Dumaguete,\
  \ I look forward to seeing the changes taking place in and around the city. I have\
  \ seen the city evolve slowly with increasing traffic jams on its narrow streets\
  \ and on-going development with new businesses enticing the local city dwellers\
  \ to new experiences. Yet, the tropical climate continues to bring heavy rainfall\
  \ or clear blue skies with a touch of humidity. Then there is the towering Cuernos\
  \ de Negros, a dormant volcano towering and surrounding the west of the city facing\
  \ the sea with the island of Siquijor to its east and Cebu to its north, where the\
  \ contrast between nature and man-made constructs provide a sense of balance despite\
  \ the constant transformations. \n\nAs I sit in a restaurant overlooking the waters,\
  \ anticipating fresh seafood from the grill and local dishes, I think back to my\
  \ time living away from home and how this impacted my outlook every time I returned.\
  \ I look at the different groups of tourists and fellow city people begin to crowd\
  \ the restaurant. Both a familiar yet foreign experience I watch as waiters interact\
  \ with the crowd of guests. I watched two young men learning Mandarin with big grins\
  \ on their faces as they are able to recall the new words of a foreign language,\
  \ they have just learned. I then look at my surroundings and think of areas from\
  \ the local public markets to the boulevard. Where my fellow city dwellers work\
  \ hard with smiles on their faces to sell their sweetest and freshest fruits and\
  \ vegetables. Or people taking time from their day to walk on the boulevard or sit\
  \ in restaurants to unwind. Perhaps, the motorists stuck in a traffic jam on their\
  \ daily commute looking out into their surroundings. It is the simplicity of these\
  \ daily processes that encapsulates the social fabric of Dumaguete. It is a place\
  \ that I hope many are able to learn or experience its unique qualities.\n\nThere\u2019\
  s more to Dumaguete that can be put into words. I believe it must be experienced\
  \ because they will then have their own story to tell. I think the next time I encounter\
  \ questions such as where my hometown is and what it is like, I now know where to\
  \ begin."
