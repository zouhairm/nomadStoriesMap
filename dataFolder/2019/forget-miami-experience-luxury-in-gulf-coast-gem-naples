Text: "\u201CSilenzio. Silenzio,\u201D a woman said trying to tell the ladies seated\
  \ next to her at a restaurant to be quiet. A waitress had appeared and was trying\
  \ to give a spiel about the lunch specials of the day. But the Italian chit-chat\
  \ between these impeccably dressed patrons appeared to be too interesting. So much\
  \ so, that no waitress or calls for \u201CSilenzio\u201D were going to tone it down.\
  \ After some time, the server was able to take everyone\u2019s order, and the rambunctious\
  \ talk started again. \n\nThe described scene is not from Rome or Rimini. It\u2019\
  s not from an Italian restaurant in New York. It\u2019s from Naples. But not that\
  \ Naples.  It is from lunchtime, on a Monday, at the Osteria Tulia restaurant in\
  \ Naples, Florida. In Florida's Southwest, the city of Naples shines as a Gulf Coast\
  \ gem. Not like a flashy diamond as Miami does, but more like an opal. It will stun\
  \ you but will not blind you. If you have visited South Beach, you know what I'm\
  \ talking about. Fifty-dollar margaritas and restaurants trying to get you inside\
  \ for a subpar meal. A $1000.00 minimum bottle service fee for someone to pour you\
  \ a $25.00 bottle of gin. People looking like a million bucks under the Miami scorching\
  \ Sun. Everything that makes South Beach, well South Beach. \n\nThe experience is\
  \ utterly different from Naples, including the way how wealth is displayed. Wealth\
  \ in Naples appears to be not only presented but measured in non-monetary costs.\
  \ It\u2019s time you can spend at the beach, playing a round of golf, or sharing\
  \ a good meal with your family and friends. This is not to say that there aren't\
  \ mansions or luxury cars in the city, but that time is one of its most flaunted\
  \ goods. You see it in the people eating outside and those enjoying the beach any\
  \ day of the week as if there was not any other care in the world. \n\nYet, even\
  \ during most holiday weekends, Naples doesn\u2019t feel crowded. In many restaurants,\
  \ you can get a table without having to make a reservation weeks prior. Take for\
  \ example Bha! Bha! Persian Bistro, one of the highest rated restaurants in Naples.\
  \ Here I made a reservation forty-eight hours before arriving and enjoyed an exceptional\
  \ meal. Imagine trying to pull that off in a bigger city!\n\nAnother place you don't\
  \ need a reservation for is to see the Gulf of Mexico. The perfect place to do so\
  \ is the historic Naples Pier, originally built in 1888. If you're lucky, from here,\
  \ you can see dolphins, hopefully no red tide, and various types of people. There\
  \ are the fisherman, the family with kids, the tanned Speedo-wearing Florida man,\
  \ and the tourist in long denim and dressy shirt who wanted to take a look at the\
  \ beach and feels out of place \u2013 yes, I'm talking about me. However, none of\
  \ these differences matter when its sunset time. I\u2019m privileged to have seen\
  \ some beautiful sunsets in my life, but those in the Florida Gulf Coast keep being\
  \ my favorites. Different color schemes every day, never disappointing and keeping\
  \ everyone in awe every time. \n\nNaples, as it happens with any place, is not for\
  \ everyone. Yes, it has the vibe of a posh city, but unlike others of its type,\
  \ you get what you pay for, including an old-time luxury you cannot find everywhere.\
  \ There is also an unexpected mix of cultures and diversity that makes this city\
  \ appealing to those looking for a getaway close to home. \n\nIf wondering where\
  \ to stay, I can recommend the Inn on Fifth boutique hotel on Downtown, which has\
  \ a surprising number of amenities. It gave me walking access to everything Naples\
  \ Fifth Avenue has to offer, and you're only ten minutes away from the beach. For\
  \ a closer stay to the Naples Pier and beach, a vacation rental site is your best\
  \ option. \n\nNaples, FL is a place where life is lived to the most, while it still\
  \ feels low key. If you're still not convinced, many restaurants have unlimited\
  \ mimosas every day of the week in a judgment-free environment. Cin Cin!"
