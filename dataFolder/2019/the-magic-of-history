Text: "Eventually, the sun comes up, people start arriving, and the new day begins.\
  \ Not at all impatient, but a bit tired. Took a quick look for the bus, but eventually\
  \ just said hang it and grabbed a taxi for E\xA318 (with a bit of haggling). Cool\
  \ driver, no English, but very friendly. And whacko! Most of the trip was going\
  \ the wrong way down one way roads. Eek.\nGot me to Ismalia House, they don't have\
  \ a room yet (6:30), but wait and one will likely empty. So I sit some more until\
  \ 10:00 when a single room clears. Wasn't sure of the standards in Egypt, but the\
  \ place was good enough for me at E\xA320. Took a nice, long, hot shower - ah! Then\
  \ slept the next five hours. Not enough sleep, but it did return me to the land\
  \ of the living.\n\nOut in the lounge chatting away with the usual mix of travellers.\
  \ Strange to be back. Despite my travels, though, I do not fit in. The true traveller\
  \ is a sensitive beast, it can detect the newcomer to its midst... Basically, I'm\
  \ still too wound up from work, and worn out from the journey. Early bed. Up early\
  \ to check out the pyramids. Hotel does a thorough tour for E\xA315, and had considered\
  \ it, but the last two items on the tour were a visit to a papyrus factory and a\
  \ visit to a carpet shop. Uh huh. And you want me to pay for this? So instead, I\
  \ traipsed out to the microbus station, just across the square. Haram? (Pyramids?)\
  \ Na'am, haram! This way! 50piasotos later, guy pulls over, \"haram?\" Yes. Feyn?\
  \ (Where?) He points and I look up to see the Great Pyramid towering over Giza city.\n\
  \  \n Pyramids at Giza, Egypt 15 minute or so walk later, I had met Micheau and\
  \ ___ from Brazil. The three of us attacked the mammoth place. Student ticket for\
  \ E\xA35. Wow. Very impressive. The sphinx was far smaller than I expected, but\
  \ the pyramids themselves were incredible. We spent the next 4+ hours exploring\
  \ the place. Camel drivers, horse drivers, postcard sellers, etc. annoy as expected,\
  \ but very manageable. Most remained friendly even after we said no (for the 10th\
  \ time). We walked all around the middle pyramid first."
