Text: "The Christmas holidays were approaching, and we dreamed of sending them to\
  \ fabulous Paris. \u201CMalika, the airports of Paris are closed due to bad weather,\
  \ I forbid you to fly to France,\u201D my mother\u2019s voice snapped. - Good mommy,\
  \ I'll be home. But in fact, having bought one-way tickets, I was so excited to\
  \ meet Paris.\nBuying travel vouchers, sightseeing tours, hire guides and helpers\
  \ is not for me. I want to dissolve in the country among the locals, and not in\
  \ the tour buses. I love to learn another culture from the inside. That is why,\
  \ having booked a hostel on a booking, taking with me a small purple bag - I rushed\
  \ off. The fact that my visa is expired, I remembered only at the airport, but in\
  \ some surprising way I still managed to be in Paris. Paris greeted me with bright\
  \ Christmas lights. I immediately lost among thousands of tourists it was like a\
  \ dream. At night, I and my purple suitcase were settled in a hostel in the Belleville\
  \ area. I planned my itinerary, studied the metro map, grabbed a dictionary, and\
  \ noted how my French week would go. In the morning when I left the hostel, I saw\
  \ many Asians, hear Chinese language, find many Chinese stores with Chinese products,\
  \ and went into shock. Then my mother called me on the mobile. - Where are you?\
  \ and I said: oops Momy, I flew to France, but oops I think I am in China ... (to\
  \ be continued)"
