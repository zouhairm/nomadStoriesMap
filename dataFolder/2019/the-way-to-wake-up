Text: "An impressive cathedral it was not.  It was rather drab, actually, with it's\
  \ green scaffolding and flapping tarpaulins creating awkward geometric patterns\
  \ across it's ancient face.\n\nIt was the culmination of weeks of  non stop walking\
  \ that saw me in the Plaza staring up at this shabby structure which countless pilgrims\
  \ before me had dreamed of, idolized, prayed and suffered for.  This Cathedral of\
  \ Santiago de Compostela, in Galicia, northern Spain, is, according to legend, where\
  \ the remains of the Apostle St James the Great are interred.  \n\nThe Way of St\
  \ James, or Camino de Santiago, has been trodden by increasing numbers of pilgrims\
  \ since the 9th century. In early times it was for religious reasons and in more\
  \ modern times it could be  religious, or to gain insight into some adversity or\
  \ simply  to check a bucket list.  I envied the simpler times. The peace of the\
  \ countryside, exploring old fashioned varieties of plants and animals, and the\
  \ history behind old buildings. I intended to savour my Camino as I would a wedge\
  \ of queso de Cabrales, that tangy, hand made blue cheese of the region.\n\nForty\
  \ days earlier, on Earth Day,  I had clomped down the cobbled streets of St-Jean-Pied-de-Port,\
  \ the French border town and a traditional starting point of the French Camino.\
  \  My walk to Santiago de Compostela 799 kilometers to the west had began.  \n\n\
  The early spring wild flowers were peeking through the succulent roadside grasses.\
  \  The gentle breeze carried the scent of fruit tree blossoms and the sounds of\
  \ bells.  Bells from around the necks of big blond cows, bells from the distant\
  \ church and high pitched tinkles from  bicycles behind me.  Fat mares and their\
  \ chunky foals ignored me as I strode on. The cud chewing cows  eyed me placidly\
  \ while they reclined in the middle of my path.  I took that as bovine speak for\
  \ you go around, I'm not moving.  My path had led down through oak groves where\
  \ the deep leaf litter embraced my tiring feet until I arrived at my first Albergue,\
  \ or pilgrim hostel.  That became the structure of my days.  \n\nThe Albergues were\
  \ located in religiously significant towns where there was always a church or it's\
  \ remains  tracing directly back to St James. I had followed the sun to the west\
  \ and observed the animals gave way to crops and then to grapevines. The tender\
  \ wild flowers were replaced with tough wild thyme and fennel.  The style of the\
  \ stone churches also varied but I was beginning to notice a theme.  They all were\
  \ proud to provide information of the battles, wars and blood shed  required in\
  \ the passionate defense of their religion. A religion which switched from Roman,\
  \ to Templar, to Moor or Christian depending on who the big stick wielder of the\
  \ time was.\n\nEntering Pamplona's fortified city via the Romanesque Bridge of Magdalena\
  \ was a sensual time warp. I could feel the energies of the activities of long ago.\
  \ Pamplona was my first larger town and it was here I learned of the different cuts\
  \ of dried meats and sausages in delicatessens along the way.  I now knew why there\
  \ are so many chunky foals in the mountain pastures.\n\nWet and tired I limped into\
  \ Leon a few days later. Like many a Pilgrim before me my spirits lifted at the\
  \ first site of the magnificent Leon Cathedral. The rain dampened stone spires and\
  \ towers were glistening gold in the later afternoon sun. It's uniform high arched\
  \ stained glass windows mimicked the heavily carved arched stone doors along the\
  \ front. The Cathedral showed nothing of the 800AD Roman baths of it's origins.\n\
  \nThis splendid cathedral housed a gallery of some of the most important religious\
  \ art in Europe. It was here, looking at a wall sized oil painting depicting some\
  \ poor sod having his entrails winched out of his body while his hands and feet\
  \ were tied, when I knew my Way was one of natural history.\n\nA few weeks later\
  \ I did attend the Pilgrim Mass at the Santiago Cathedral. I thanked James, the\
  \ Moor Slayer, for his contribution to my Camino, but I didn't ask for his blessing."
