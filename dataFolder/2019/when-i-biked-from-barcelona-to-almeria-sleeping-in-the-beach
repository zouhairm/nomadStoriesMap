Text: 'I''m Matteo, I''m an avarage Italian guy or, better, i was. Now i have a story
  that i will always carry with me and which will give me the strenght to repeat what
  i did but let me explain. Last summer i went to Barcelona to achieve new experience
  but i had no idea of what i would have encountred or done. It''s not common to take
  a bike and ride for 700km and even more! In my travel i was alone, i started my
  journey looking for new experiences and now i''me extremely proud of what i did,
  it''s crazy! I''m not a rider but while the days passed i was more and more confident:
  at the end i was able to run for more than 70km in a single day! I''ve visited incredible
  places, I''ve met amazing people and this all without spending more than 5 euros
  each day because i didn''t have to pay the hotel. The night i was scary i put myself
  into the sleeping bag and hoped for the best, luckily everything went fine. This
  travel will always be my secret, i hope a lot more will happen but this is the first
  and i will carry it forever into my hearth, but oi promise that what happened is
  mostly incredible. This is your opportunity! I''m here, i''m young, i''m Matteo,
  i''m a traveller. Contact me! Otherwise i will keep on travelling on my own, write
  for my journal and visit the world this way :) I wish you all good and incredible
  experiences, lot of love, Matteo.'
