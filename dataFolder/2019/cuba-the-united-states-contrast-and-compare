Text: "I did not believe the true proximity between the United States and Cuba until\
  \ I flew from Fort Lauderdale to Havana. For two countries with a noted history\
  \ of derision and disagreements, it felt as though Cuba and the United States were\
  \ worlds away. Upon arriving in Cuba I could feel just how hot and humid it truly\
  \ is and how similar the weather is to Florida. When we got to the customs area\
  \ of the airport I was expecting to be asked a multitude of questions regarding\
  \ my purpose for traveling to Cuba, but I was simply welcomed and had my passport\
  \ stamped. Conversely, in my experience the customs procedures in the United States\
  \ are much more invasive, even for United States citizens. I wasn\u2019t quite sure\
  \ what to expect upon walking out of the airport because I had heard various opinions\
  \ regarding the political and social climate of Cuba, but I was pleasantly surprised\
  \ to encounter vibrant people and a multitude of classic cars and travelers. The\
  \ overall most surprising experience on the first day in Cuba was how nice the hotel\
  \ was and the fact that it was nicer than my dorm in College Park. Everyone I encountered\
  \ on my first day was very kind and welcoming, which I was not expecting given the\
  \ historically tense status of Cuba and United States relations. My expectations\
  \ of Cuba were surpassed due to its enhanced development and kind citizens, and\
  \ I was excited to learn more about the history of the country as well as experience\
  \ the culture of Cuba. \n\nOn the next day in Cuba I was able to meet with officials\
  \ from the Ministry of Public Health at the Hotel Nacional to learn more about the\
  \ Cuban health system. The doctor told me about the many advances Cuba has made\
  \ over the years to expand coverage for Cuban citizens. He also explained to me\
  \ that Cuba approaches health and the access to health care as a basic human right.\
  \ I agreed immensely with the doctor and believe that every person should have the\
  \ ability to access health care. Additionally, the health are system is universal,\
  \ free, accessible to all, regionalized, and comprehensive. This approach has helped\
  \ Cuba in their approach to health care and the betterment of Cuban citizens. Currently\
  \ the average life span is now 78.9 years, when it was previously a mere 60 years\
  \ in 1959. \n\nUnderstanding the similarities and differences between the United\
  \ States and Cuba has helped me to develop a broader understanding not only of the\
  \ ways in which the two countries might complement each other, but the trip has\
  \ instilled in me a great hope that one day Cuba and the United States will learn\
  \ from each other and that a strong and mutually beneficial relationship may develop,\
  \ with both countries reaping the benefits."
