Text: "The first time I heard about Domingos Martins, a city in the State of Espirito\
  \ Santo, Brazil, I was surprised to see I did not know anything at all about it.\
  \ How could this small town have escaped my traveler\u2019s sight for so long? I\
  \ was looking for Winter Festivals for my next weekend getaway. It had to be anywhere\
  \ near Rio de Janeiro, where I live. Then I stumbled upon this city and all its\
  \ attractions, which included natural landscapes, gorgeous mountain views, outdoor\
  \ activities, fine places to eat, and of course, a Classical and Popular Music Festival.\
  \ At first, what caught my attention was the festival and the climate. The city\
  \ is in the mountainous region of the State, and in July, the weather was pleasantly\
  \ cool there. But what I did find was a huge variety of things to see and to do.\
  \ \nIt was not difficult to find a place to stay, since I\u2019m not that picky\
  \ when it comes to accommodation. Also, the great number of options made it simple\
  \ and cheap to book a nice inn for a reasonable price, in the surrounding area of\
  \ the city. The trip would be done by car, which is what our small family usually\
  \ chooses when it\u2019s a close-by city. Even so, it took us close to 8 hours to\
  \ cover the 335 miles of the way, because of road conditions. We arrived there just\
  \ in time for the opening of the festival. So, after we rushed to the inn to check\
  \ in and rest a little, we went back to the square to spend the rest of the day\
  \ delighting ourselves with good music, amazing food and beer, and crafts from local\
  \ artisans.\nThe next day, we had a lot to do. First, know the city a bit better.\
  \ Domingos Martins was mostly colonized by the Germans and that is proudly advertised\
  \ around the city. One of the most charming things I could notice were small signs\
  \ in front of places in town like drugstores and banks, with the name of the kind\
  \ of store in both Portuguese and German. It seems foolish, but it made me feel\
  \ like I was learning a new language, not just receiving touristic information.\
  \ \nWe visited the Culture house, a little empty at that time, and learned about\
  \ the history of the place and the most famous Winter festival of the region. Then\
  \ we made a small tour on foot, stopping by beautiful Lutheran and Catholic churches,\
  \ the city market and many crafts stores. We made a longer stop at the German Colonization\
  \ Museum. A huge collection of items, including objects and documents of the period\
  \ when people from Germany came to settle in different places in Brazil. A part\
  \ of our History, preserved to be retold to us and our children, well kept in this\
  \ cute little town. \nWe ended up at the square, named after one of Espirito Santo\u2019\
  s governors, Arthur Gerhardt. There we still enjoyed part of the festival that was\
  \ still going on, and watched the presentation of folk dance groups in typical German\
  \ costumes. A busy day for such a small place.\nSunday was our farewell. But we\
  \ wanted to explore the surroundings. We knew about this State Park, called Parque\
  \ da Pedra Azul (Blue Rock Park), and someone had told us about this mysterious\
  \ rock that changes colors according to the light of day, and the incredible formation\
  \ attached to one of its sides, called Pedra do lagarto (Lizard Rock), so we took\
  \ the car and went there. The park is at the end of a wonderful road, full of restaurants,\
  \ small ranches that produce strawberries and other products, some craftspeople\
  \ selling charming bird houses and other wood crafts\u2026 everything so pleasant\
  \ that we almost forgot the Park. The rock is of course not blue, it is just the\
  \ effect of the light on it. And the Lizard rock is so realistic it seems like it\
  \ was carved in the stone. Truly unusual and fantastic. I really was not expecting\
  \ so much from such a trivial trip."
