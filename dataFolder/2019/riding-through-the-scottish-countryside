Text: "I was conscious of the depth to my breaths, staring out the window, chewing\
  \ on my shirt, feeling watched. When everything else stops bothering me, there\u2019\
  s always the heaviness to my breathing. It\u2019s like a last resort of my body\u2019\
  s predisposition to feeling discomfort. I'm too loud.\n\nWe\u2019d been moving for\
  \ so long.\nLow mountains in the distance, hills, maybe. Hills in the foreground,\
  \ rolling, everything rolling. Trees, sparse, leafless. A green December. Manicured\
  \ grass where the sheep graze. And there were eyes over everything. Everything was\
  \ rolling; eyes over everything.\n\nThat morning I stood on the River Clyde. Still,\
  \ knifing through the dated buildings and nouveau bridges of central Glasgow, it\
  \ flowed as a second world, a mirror. I leaned over the railing, but not too far,\
  \ and saw myself. It was the end of my solo Christmas vacation. I woke up early,\
  \ walked around the congested Princes St., through some of the boujee department\
  \ stores with crystals on the inside and marbled fa\xE7ades on the street, and toured\
  \ an art museum. I stood on the river. I said goodbye to a pretty neat city. A good\
  \ start to the day.\n\nBut at a cost. Because I lost track of time, I plopped down\
  \ in the last empty row, disheveled, a little mad that all the table seats were\
  \ taken up, that the legroom was lacking. Really disheveled, wearing the last stitch\
  \ of fabric out of my clothes. Eight o\u2019clock shadow. The train lurched forward\
  \ and we rode, as if by horseback, though I\u2019ve never ridden a horse.\n\nI noticed\
  \ her after a few minutes. A girl my age was sitting alone in the table seat to\
  \ my front, obstructed by the chairback between us, facing me through a window.\
  \ It happened when the city buildings departed and the first fields of green took\
  \ over. The contrast between the pastoral landscapes and her piercing eyes studying\
  \ my reflection, staring at me. We made eye contact, her trapping me, then she got\
  \ this small grin. I looked away, keeping her in peripherie. Eventually she shifted\
  \ to something else, so it was my turn. Then hers. We went back and forth for a\
  \ while.\nWith the hills rolling, eyes over everything.\n\nSunny, so sunny. It was\
  \ a montage, the powerlines and trees passing by as splits in the frames. Square\
  \ hedges separated farms. Not wooden fences, not the wooden and wire fences of rural\
  \ Georgia and Virginia and Pennsylvania, but hedged fences grew between the grazing\
  \ fields and rows of crops. Everywhere, there were hedges and single rows of trees\
  \ as outlines. And everywhere, there were eyes over everything.\n\nI was trying\
  \ not to stare, how successfully I don\u2019t know. She, however, held eyes unfazed.\
  \ They just kept on looking. Too loud; my breaths were too loud. Stop staring, ma\u2019\
  am, you\u2019re making me blush.\n\nRuins of a castle passed us by\u2014a small\
  \ castle, or a big castle that\u2019s now become small, the same process as people\
  \ losing a couple inches when they hit their 70s. Grey, jagged on the left, it was\
  \ basically a remnant of a foundation digging into the earth. One of the walls,\
  \ though, still stuck around.\n\nThen it fell out of view, replaced by more hedges\
  \ and sheep, grazing sheep. More sun, more eyes. But heavy glares took her away.\
  \ From just the right angles of sunshine, we disappeared into the grass. Those parts\
  \ were easy.\n\nWe passed through tunnels. The reflection turned to mirror, like\
  \ the River Clyde, our faces transporting to some world where we were too close\
  \ together. I couldn\u2019t look away under tunnels, because there wasn\u2019t anywhere\
  \ to go. She would catch me with her soft little smile. I was trapped, and her straight\
  \ brown hair, long, parted at the middle, her too pale skin, that buttoned nose\
  \ with maybe freckles, her fleek through each follicle of fairly thick eyebrows,\
  \ her wooly green sweater, they were everything.\n\nThis was a vacation. I wasn\u2019\
  t focusing on the beautiful Scottish countryside. I wasn\u2019t focused on being\
  \ an ocean away from home. The day just fell away to a girl on a train, to a silent\
  \ conversation, to a stranger, and now, to a tiny memory."
