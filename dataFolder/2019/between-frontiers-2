Text: "The subtle sound of my alarm began to infiltrate my deep sleepiness. With a\
  \ blurry view, I immediately jumped out of the bed hoping that I wasn\u2019t late:\
  \ It was 4:30 in the morning. The crack between the curtains of the room revealed\
  \ a tulip garden immersed in the calm and silent darkness. A brick path was highlighted\
  \ by the artificial light, contrasting with the trees that framed up the landscape\
  \ of the hotel Espacio y Tiempo located in La Junta, Chile. \n\n\u201CPlease put\
  \ your bags in the car before breakfast\u201D, my dad whispered while my sister\
  \ and my mom were still sleeping by my side.\n\nIn our early breakfast briefing\
  \ we established that the aim of the day would be to arrive at the Argentinian city\
  \ of Perito Moreno, known by the land travellers as one of the main stops before\
  \ going down to Ushuaia, the southernmost city of the World. Our first stop would\
  \ be Ma\xF1ihuales, a small village sustained by fishing and located at the underfoot\
  \ of the Andes mountain chain.\n\nWe left the warm and cozy hotel to throw ourselves\
  \ on the road again. It was the 6th day we had been following this script since\
  \ we left our garage in S\xE3o Paulo, Brazil: waking up early, getting into the\
  \ car and doing almost 620 miles per day, towards south, with an uncertain destination.\n\
  \nThrough my window I could see the landscape changing fast and revealing itself\
  \ as unique as it was before. From that same right-sided window I had seen mirrored\
  \ skyscrapers and fields with jumping guanacos. Abruptly, my thoughts were interrupted\
  \ by noisy alerts coming from our cell phones. Connection had came back. My entire\
  \ family was now completely absorbed by their distractive screens as if each one\
  \ of them were following their own imaginary road. As they scrolled down the feed,\
  \ I started to fall asleep in my solitude, while observing the beige grass blowing\
  \ in the wind. \n\nAfter a couple of hours, the pavement of Ruta 45 led us to gravel\
  \ roads, that slowly began to camouflage the car in the dust. Under the sunlight,\
  \ the fresh atmosphere accompanied by translucent lakes and snowy peaks started\
  \ to fade away from our sight. The farther we went towards east, driving away from\
  \ the Pacific Coast, the drier the landscape got.\n\nThe transition of the shining\
  \ sun to dark-orange shades marked the compass of our day. Watching the sun coming\
  \ along with us allowed me to maintain calm while my legs were begging for a walk.\
  \ It was late afternoon when we arrived at Puerto Iba\xF1ez, the last city before\
  \ crossing the frontier between Argentina and Chile. One of the three GPS\u2019\
  s set on the car panel showed a tiny moving point on the map, that followed the\
  \ sinuous path between the mountains. This small dot had accumulated around 350\
  \ miles in 13 hours. From the monotony of watching it moving, I turned aside to\
  \ appreciate Chile\u2019s sight for the last time. After a while I glanced back\
  \ to the navigator and saw the small dot crossing a line.\n\nWithout any change\
  \ of atmosphere and no welcoming signs we were then in Argentinian territory. I\
  \ was certainly expecting to see a small frontier house, waiting for us, but while\
  \ looking at the vast breathtaking landscape I could see no control house, no officer.\
  \ There was absolutely nothing beyond the mountains and guanacos. Have we missed\
  \ it?\n\nForty clueless minutes were spent on the road when finally a small white-and-green\
  \ construction started to reveal itself in the middle of the arid mountains. This\
  \ time I wasn\u2019t sure of where I was. I saw myself somewhere in a gap of the\
  \ map. As if in a \u201CNobody\u2019s land\u201D, I saw nobody, no walls, no sign\
  \ at all. It was a stretch of a peaceful and heavenly land. I looked down and saw\
  \ the only visible frontier, seamed on the leather seat dividing not more than our\
  \ spaces. It took me 8.015 miles and 21 days travelling between the Atlantic and\
  \ the Pacific Coast to understand that the frontiers that matter are not drawn in\
  \ maps, but they are mentally sewed up between us, everywhere we go."
