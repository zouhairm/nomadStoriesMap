Text: "Today I would love to share a story how simple story can change your life.\
  \ Everything was started 3 years ago, when I decide at 21 years old to go for my\
  \ first travel somewhere when I can learn something more and to enjoy rest. My job\
  \ is a cook and my dream was to travel in the country where is hospitality number\
  \ one industry. And I chose United Arab Emirates \U0001F1E6\U0001F1EA, even they\
  \ have very strickt rules but I decide I should try. After when I collect money\
  \ for this trip I went for 14 days in amazing city Of United Arab Emirate - Dubai.\
  \ When I arrived to this city of course I cannot concentrate on my mission I become\
  \ as explorer of this city and their architectures after 5 days I start to look\
  \ for really amazing and creative restaurants. And the important thing for was to\
  \ see open kitchen to see whole process. I visit some of them and it was incredible.\
  \ I got a quite a lot of knowledge from this travel and in my last day I decide\
  \ to go in 1 restaurant which was near my hotel and it was really nice restaurant\
  \ with open kitchen but which I didn\u2019t see in the Internet and while I was\
  \ watching and one of the gentleman came to me and start to talk, unfortunately\
  \ at that time my English wasn\u2019t really great but I could speak to him and\
  \ he ask me where I\u2019m from and why I\u2019m interested to see how guys cooking\
  \ and I told him my history as I\u2019m a cook and this is what I\u2019m doing for\
  \ a last 5 years. And he immediately told to let me join to his team and of course\
  \ I shocked and told him :- Is this a joke\u201D and he answered no I\u2019m serious.\
  \ He told come in the kitchen tomorrow and he will see how I will work and I told\
  \ as tomorrow I need to leave and he told okay than let\u2019s go now. After 1 hour\
  \ being on the kitchen it was so amazing and interesting andanaher told he prepared\
  \ for me job offer letter and I should sign. Of course I understood it wasn\u2019\
  t joke and I told I can\u2019t as I have flight and my job in my country Unkraine.\
  \ He told no problem sign offer letter and give a can of your passport and wait\
  \ for inviting letter to my mail with tickets after 3 weeks.\n\nI sign and have\
  \ copy of my passport and I left and I didn\u2019t excpect anything as I didn\u2019\
  t take his details only he took my mail. When I fly to my home I told story to my\
  \ family and they told that so nice it\u2019s not possible that much easy and I\
  \ agreed. After 3 weeks I got on my mail my visa and tickets and I almost start\
  \ to cry as I cannot believe it\u2019s true. My family told Dreams is really coming\
  \ true if you wanna  and doing something for it. \nThe story just started but why\
  \ my life was changed? Life was changed because after 3 years I become a assistant\
  \ manager of the famous restaurant in Dubai. You will ask how it\u2019s happened,\
  \ but when I work on the kitchen I was inviting all guests to see how proces is\
  \ going on while using internet on phones and after 1 year another gentleman invite\
  \ to him restaurant and told I should talk to guest and explain proces or cooking\
  \ and I became a waiter than head waiter after couple of time when I understood\
  \ restaurant and everything what in it it\u2019s my passion and my life I need to\
  \ manage it. In the end next plan to grow more till I\u2019ll not make my next dream\
  \ which is open my own restaurant and to travel more to learn and to see restaurants\
  \ working in another countries and specially in Spain \U0001F1EA\U0001F1F8.\n\n\
  I\u2019m sure another interesting story is waiting on all us while we traveling\
  \ to somewhere and doesn\u2019t matter how far is it and how expensive it can be.\
  \ Travel is worth it!"
