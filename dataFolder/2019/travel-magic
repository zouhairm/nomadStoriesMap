Text: "Having previously traveled and farmed solo in South America I was no stranger\
  \ at the time to getting lost and carving my own path when it comes to adventure\
  \ and travel. It was my passionate wanderlust that made me scoff internal as my\
  \ good friend suggested as a group we all go to the ancient Mayan city of Tikal\
  \ in Guatemala. My advocacy against going to this incredible feat of human ingenuity,\
  \ nearly prevented this awe inspiring moment from ever happening. But now in retrospect\
  \ it was good that by stuburness was trumpeted by the group decision to go explore\
  \ the wonder of Tikal. \nWe walked the little paths filled with many trees back\
  \ through the park. My young roboast attitude; filled to the brim with excitement\
  \ to learn about plants prompted me to ask a park guard of this ancient Mayan Temple\
  \ amusement park (if you will) if a certain berry was edible. Maybe I was a breath\
  \ of fresh air because I was an American tourist speaking Spanish or maybe it was\
  \ something else, but these two guards approached me kindly. As our group of friends\
  \ began to grow impatient, and the feeling was as though we were to get on with\
  \ the getting on, one of the guards offered me and our group a rather tempting proposal.\
  \ If we were to hand over $20 something dollars each we all would be grated as a\
  \ group the \"Hush hush special;\" where you come back after dark when the park\
  \ closes and climb the large stone temple some 21 stories high and stay the night!\
  \ So we handed over our Dinero and jumped at the opportunity to spend the night\
  \ atop of a ancient Mayan Temple. Later that night, climbed the wrinky-dinky wooden\
  \ scaffolding that was jimmy rigged along the back side of the temple that in all\
  \ its glory was stone stacked by hand long ago. I touched the slightly cool stone\
  \ and I was feeling a mix of overly gritty with excitement and the mental clarity\
  \ that only adrenaline gives you. Pure adventure with my childhood friends! We fully\
  \ understood that we only had a tiny ledge about 10 feet by 10 feet keeping us safe\
  \ from a 20 story free fall! We all sat down facing the East; it was Beautiful!\
  \ How did 5 friends from a small mountain town find themselves perched atop of a\
  \ Guatemalan Mayan stone temple? Heart. I believe that traveling with all your Heart\
  \ opens Life to the possibilities of wonder, meaningful moments, and magic  A Sudden\
  \ flash of light ignites the jungle night Sky and the sky becomes glowing white\
  \ to green. A ball of fire falling, flying, and shooting through the star lit sky.\
  \ A meteorite woozes by, no more than 20 feet above our heads! A group of five Life-long\
  \ friends, myself included, sit huddled on the stone\u2019s edge, atop of a giant\
  \ Mayan Temple that towers  21 stories high above the jungled forest floor! I knew\
  \ adventure leads one to exciting places, but I didn\u2019t except to find myself\
  \ in a truly magical moment! The night evolving beautifully, only interrupted by\
  \ brief intervals of anxiety provoking howling growls from Howler Monkeys in the\
  \ not so distant distance. Stirring images in my mind of killer monkeys from that\
  \ Hollywood movie Congo. To behold the splendor of the night sky, littered with\
  \ stars in every direction from the top of this Giant pyramid stretching high above\
  \ the jungle, the very same temples in the milineums past that were used to map\
  \ out the cosmos above and created sophisticatedly accurate maps of the movement\
  \ of heavenly celestial bodies throughout our skies and time. In the wee hours of\
  \ the pre-dawn sunrise our conversation somehow went around the bend and we talked\
  \ about how life is fluid like a river. That our reality is flowing and evolving\
  \ and ever growing. Although I am not sure if I said it out loud then, but I for\
  \ sure deeply felt it then as I do now, that this life is a river of love and we\
  \ must be open to it's magic, let it flow, and jump right in!"
