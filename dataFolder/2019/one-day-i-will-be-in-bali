Text: "\"the dream will becomes true one day, i'm waiting...\"\n\nBali is a very famous\
  \ island in Indonesia. Many tourists from all over the world visit each year, and\
  \ the island is well known for its art, culture, food, and beaches.\nThe first time\
  \ was packed with sightseeing activities. Although I was exhausted, I fell in love\
  \ with the beautiful Bali immediately. I went there with my two friends.\nWe stayed\
  \ in a two-bedroom villa, as there were four of us, and it was cheaper to share\
  \ a villa. We wanted a relaxing trip so we hung out in the villa most of the time\
  \ during our stay. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable. There was\
  \ also a private pool. I must say that staying in a villa was a really great experience.\
  \ It has became one of the reason why Bali is in the list of my favourite holiday\
  \ destinations.\nBali is rich with art and culture. I saw architecture, sculptures,\
  \ carvings, and paintings all around, and they were amazing. I got to know a little\
  \ more about the culture of Bali through them.\n\nAnother reason that Bali became\
  \ one of my favourite holiday destinations is because of the beach. In all of my\
  \ Bali trips, I went to Kuta Beach, famous among the locals and tourists. I enjoyed\
  \ taking a walk along the beach with my bare feet, and watching the sunset. It was\
  \ amazing to see how the sky changed its colors during sunset.\n\nEven though I\u2019\
  m not a foodie type of person, food still plays an important role in my trip. Bebek\
  \ Bengil is a well known restaurant in Ubud which famous for its crispy duck. Seafood\
  \ was another not-to-be-missed food during the trip. We went to Jimbaran Beach to\
  \ enjoy a sumptuous seafood dinner. The price was slightly expensive but the great\
  \ view and good companion had made it up\n\nBali is definitely a great place for\
  \ holiday and it will be one of my favourite holiday destinations for many years\
  \ to come."
