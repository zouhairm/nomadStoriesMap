Text: "The days were short and passing quickly and after all I was happy and excited\
  \ too because our Annual Holy Festival was close but I had no holidays from the\
  \ university but my excitation drew me towards my home to celebrate the Festival\
  \ with my family. Lately I left for bus station to take last remaining bus for my\
  \ city but due to some problems the last bus was unable to go, at the time I thought\u201D\
  \ Just leave the carnival, it will come back next year!\u201D but I saw some people\
  \ was also upset like I was and they were talking to hire a car towards Mithi city,\
  \ where I have to go. From my childhood I had been a shy and introvert person but\
  \ at that my curiosity to reach my hometown made me bold enough to ask them for\
  \ single seat so then I asked them and they gave a positive response. My excitation\
  \ level was extremely high because I was going to my home after two months. The\
  \ driver had just started the car, a obese old man with average height and well\
  \ dressed; came near the car and said driver that there are some ladies about three\
  \ to four and the driver should take them because they have their annual festival.\
  \ As the old man was saying this I was getting anxious and nervous because we strictly\
  \ believe that Ladies should be first! By the way, the ladies refused the offer\
  \ because they became double in amount and the car could carry maximum four to five\
  \ person excepting the driver.\nAfter this short incomplete tragedy, we left from\
  \ the station. We were total six people in the car and I think out of six, three\
  \ were uneducated but looking kind.\nThe old man was also sitting on front seat\
  \ of the car and was looking in a great hurry.  Beside my left there was a young\
  \ healthy person looking well educated and started gossip; \u201CUncle how is the\
  \ life moving?\u201D said the person beside me, the old man replied that it\u2019\
  s not moving and it\u2019s running! Initially there gossip was long and too boring\
  \ to enjoy the journey. I was trying to capturing some amazing images through my\
  \ old mobile in the running car and then slowly and gradually there left a profound\
  \ peaceful silence in the car. And then they all just started asking me a bunch\
  \ of useless questions. But after a while, I started enjoying their gossip. \nThe\
  \ person beside my left, the person told his name Manzoor Ahmed. His words were\
  \ attractive and mesmerising. First he told a long poetry which was really amazing\
  \ but I forgot it after the Journey. Then he asked me my name in a gentle manner\
  \ and I replied\u201D I am Sunil, sir.\u201D The he asked my qualification and interests\
  \ and I replied that I am an undergraduate student and I am really curious about\
  \ Astronomy, and Cosmology but these two terms weren\u2019t  so common in our society\
  \ and I was also from middle class family so I persuade Mechanical Engineering.\
  \  I am also fond of collecting books especially fiction and science related.  Then\
  \ I inquired the gentle man and his story was very tough and inspiring. After that\
  \ we become good friend.\nAnd then we stopped at old hotel for tea and from where\
  \ we continued our journey and after covering some distance Manzoor ended his journey\
  \ with us  and saying good bye, he moved with air and we moved with the car. Hiding\
  \ the sun the sky gradually became dark and I was feeling very lazy and sleepy but\
  \ suddenly I saw the lights, yes it was my destination my lovely city Mithi and\
  \ where I left with thanks and good bye.\n  I made five new relations and all were\
  \ kind and humble. I still get the messages from Manzoor and the other people and\
  \ remember the journey.\nAnd I also wrote five new characters in my diary and in\
  \ the end I wrote a quote about the journey that:\u201D Arrow of time will pass,\
  \ many come and many leave and it\u2019s the life but all we enjoy afterwards are\
  \ our moments and memories.\u201D"
