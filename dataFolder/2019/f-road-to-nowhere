  \ I rationalize aloud, as I throw a rock into the murky water and watch it disappear.\n\
  \n\u201CYou\u2019re right.  We haven\u2019t seen another car in hours, and we have\
  \ no cell service. It\u2019s too risky.\u201D  Colin says, hating to admit defeat.\
  \ \u201CAll I know is that next trip we\u2019re renting a Super Jeep with a snorkel.\u201D\
  \n\nFor the last two or so hours, Colin and I have been driving on a desolate F\
  \ road, composed of black soil and volcanic rock, through the highlands of Iceland.\
  \  The word road is to be used loosely.  There are no double lines or asphalt foundations.\
  \ Instead, it\u2019s more like a rocky, dirt passage riddled with ruts and steep,\
  \ winding inclines barely wide enough for the mandatory 4x4 to traverse.   Some\
  \ run parallel to glaciers or lead to jaw-dropping waterfalls (just look for anything\
  \ on your map ending in -foss).  But perhaps most notable are the frigid, glacial\
  \ rivers that flow across your path.   Even with the constant clamor of earth being\
  \ crushed beneath your tires, like a nerve-wracking white noise machine, you can\
  \ hear the torrent roaring for your attention.  \n\nI had already counted ourselves\
  \ lucky more than once on this day\u2019s excursion.  I had white-knuckled the hand\
  \ grip as our tires spun in the mud or disappeared down into cavernous potholes.\
  \  We had giggled our way through the obstacle of defiant Icelandic sheep who seemingly\
  \ darted into our path intentionally.  \n\nBut those challenges seemed mundane presently.\
  \  We were standing in front of one of those notable, passage-blocking rivers. \
  \ Dark clouds were above our heads, both figuratively and literally, and rain pelted\
  \ our waterproof jackets while we continued to hash out the risks vs rewards of\
  \ fording this body of water.  We had already decided to turn back, and yet we still\
  \ hadn\u2019t budged.  The unknown of what was beyond that river was pulling my\
  \ once logical thoughts apart.\n\n\u201CIn one of the travel blogs I read, it said\
  \ that flowing water is actually safer to cross because potential rocks are moved\
  \ by the current,\u201D I offer.\n\n\u201CIf we get stuck, there\u2019s no telling\
  \ how long it would take for someone to find us,\u201D Colin responds.\n\nI let\
  \ out a sigh, partially in relief, because his voice of reason is what I need to\
  \ hear.  It was time to buckle up and retreat. I wait for Colin to restart the engine,\
  \ but I realize he\u2019s staring into the rear-view mirror.  \n\n\u201CWhat is\
  \ it?\u201D I ask, careening my neck to match his gaze.  And then I see it too.\
  \  There\u2019s an SUV barreling up the path.  We sit there, silently observing.\
  \  \n \nAs the vehicle approaches, I expect it to stop.  I expect its passengers\
  \ to get out and survey the surroundings like we had, but nothing like that happens.\
  \  Instead, I cover my gaping mouth as the driver barely taps the brakes before\
  \ charging into the water.  In just a few moments, our daredevil is on the other\
  \ side and driving out of sight.\n\nColin and I lock eyes and burst into fits of\
  \ laughter.  \u201CDid that just happen? I\u2019m taking that as a sign,\u201D I\
  \ declare.  \n\nI know Colin agrees because the car is now in drive and we\u2019\
  re creeping toward the water\u2019s edge.  Although we have more ground clearance\
  \ than the 4x4 ahead of us, we\u2019re taking it slow and steady.  \n\nI hit record\
  \ on the dash cam and let out a squeal as our tires dip into the water.  The car\
  \ rocks from side to side as we travel over what\u2019s hidden below.  Midway through\
  \ the water is up to the headlights and for a moment I feel like the car might start\
  \ floating.  \n\n\u201CCome on, come on,\u201D we encourage the vehicle.  I close\
  \ my eyes as my heart beats wildly.  And then I feel the tires grip the earth as\
  \ we emerge.   \nAt first, we sit in silence, only the sound of our rapid breath\
  \ filling the air.  But then a string of profanity, followed by an eruption of euphoric\
  \ laughter, ensues.  \n\nWith the adrenaline still coursing through my body, I grin.\
  \  \u201CLet\u2019s see what\u2019s next.\u201D"
