Text: "I have heard about Singapore when I was a little kid, but I do not know why\
  \ and how from a small island with over 5 million people, almost no natural resources,\
  \ Singapore can attract a lot of people come and visit. I am a curious person, I\
  \ desire to explore the reason behind the success of one of the four Asia\u2019\
  s Tigers, so I came to visit Singapore last July. It is apparently a leap to the\
  \ unknown. My first impression is there is the city is so green and fresh. The city\
  \ with a lot of buildings is covered by a lot of big trees. It makes the crowded\
  \ city become cool even in the summer. Besides, together with the development of\
  \ the economy, people become more and more coldly, insensibly, especial in the big\
  \ city. But when I came to Singapore, I realized that it did not happen there. When\
  \ I ask the information about one location, they could even go together with me\
  \ to the nearest bus station. During that time, they also gave me some advices about\
  \ some places to go, some markets to try the local food. That is my first impression\
  \ of people there, friendly and nice to others. Then, day by day, I met others,\
  \ they also gave me a lot of lessons such as gave a seat to the necessary person,\
  \ were quite in public transportation, respected for the elderly, especially, were\
  \ kind to others. Moreover, when I went to the Zoo in Singapore, I was surprised\
  \ by the way they treated animals. They live in the open and natural environment,\
  \ surrounded by trees and plants but a fence, visitors also can touch them. Not\
  \ only animals but plants are also were protected in here. Visitors could saw a\
  \ lot of beautiful flowers and majestic trees in the Garden. Because of that, people\
  \ will feel more close to nature and animals, then more aware of protecting the\
  \ environment and animals. Speaking of Singapore, I cannot deny the attraction of\
  \ local food. I was a fan of local food in Singapore such as Chilli Crab, Hainanese\
  \ Chicken Rice, Laksa, Satay\u2026 etc. It not only how delicious they are, but\
  \ also the way they serve me. Moreover, because of loving reading, I went to some\
  \ bookstores in Singapore which made me want to bring the bookstore to Vietnam.\
  \ Bookstores bring ancient beauty and warm feeling for visitors. At first glance,\
  \ I thought it was an art gallery or a living room rather than a bookstore. Special\
  \ architectural works in Singapore also make me have to pay attention to. I love\
  \ Helix Bridge, because it has a double helix structure, which is different from\
  \ others. I like to see Esplanade, because it looks incredible not only from outside\u2026\
  etc. There are a ton of things to say about my trip to Singapore, but I think the\
  \ most important thing is I know the reason why Singapore is so attractive to people.\
  \ It not only about the human, but also about the way they create new things, the\
  \ way they treat, and the way they motivate people to make the life become better."
