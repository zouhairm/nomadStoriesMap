Text: "Was IT me? Or was I only hiding my fear behind this fake face? Why did I need\
  \ to go away to find out who I really was? To be honest, I was not running away,\
  \ but there is one fact about this, I really was trying to find myself. I was held\
  \ into a life full of rutinary moments, had just broken up after a devastating 5\
  \ year relationship, and all I wanted to know was, who am I? And why am i not pursuing\
  \ my dream? It really did not sound that hard, I knew I needed a turn around in\
  \ my life, I was too used to my old life that all i wanted to do was something crazy,\
  \ as always. So I just sat down and said, \"Canada.\" Why not? It was not really\
  \ the best beginning of all, it was complicated, as every beginning we are very\
  \ happy and enthusiastic, but, everything started upside down, I was only on a 6\
  \ month permit, but as soon as i got there things started to get ugly, had no chance\
  \ to work, migration was a pain, had no friends and I started to ran out of money.\
  \ \n\nWhat can be worse than that? Oh wait yeah I had left my room at the Hostel\
  \ because it was too expensive, so, yes it got worse. I was sitting down on the\
  \ edge of the sidewalk with me bags thinking, what am I going to do? I cannot go\
  \ back to my old life! I came here for one objective, maybe a couple, but I am not\
  \ turning around with out even achieving ONE of my goals. I started to text friends\
  \ out back from my country, asking for help, by the way I was the type of person\
  \ that will never ask you for help, I was the all mighty. But i started to realize\
  \ i was destroying myself all along with that attitude. So I started to call for\
  \ help and 15 minutes hadn't passed by when one of my friends responded my SOS message,\
  \ asking me where I was, how was my situation, frustrated I started to tell her\
  \ how I felt and how I was, she started to move fast and made some calls, a moment\
  \ passed by and I was feeling anxious of her answer, as soon as she responded my\
  \ heart stopped, and saw the best answer ever, a friend of her is in Canada, same\
  \ city as me with an available spot at his house, with an available job. How great\
  \ was I after I saw that message, after I knew that her friend was wanting to help\
  \ me , I felt blessed. This was new for me, the only help I was used to was my parents\
  \ help, I was used to helping other people instead of me being helped. My story\
  \ was, bring my self down just to help out others, wasn't the best decision of my\
  \ life every time I had to do that, but I was not noticing that the way I was doing\
  \ everything was all wrong. After a couple of months in Canada I had felt more alive\
  \ than any other moment in my life, I had open my mind and vision to a whole different\
  \ level,  as i knew and had learned i was where i was because of my decisions, it\
  \ was me all this time who had control over my life. All I was doing was blaiming\
  \ everything for my actions and results, I really don't k how what it was or how\
  \ it happened , but, Canada without thoughts has been one of my best experiences\
  \ of life. And I will always say \"Thank you\", for all the people that helped me\
  \ out through out this journey and made my journey the best of them all. New adventures\
  \ a wait and a prosperous and abundant life. After I came back from Canada, maybe\
  \ sooner then expected, but a decision I took, I had nothing to say but MISSION\
  \ ACCOMPLISHED!"
