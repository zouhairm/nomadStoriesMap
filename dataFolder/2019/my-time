  \ country in the world but still india is one place where u will get love from most\
  \ of the people and the diverse culture and languages makes you even more curious\
  \ that in every hundred kilometer there is a new language and new culture . My this\

  \ in himachal pradesh in india where the clouds meets the mountains and the sun\
  \ kiss you very gently . I met local people and stayed with them in there houses\
  \ and enjoyed their hospitality in there manner . I understand that if a want love\
