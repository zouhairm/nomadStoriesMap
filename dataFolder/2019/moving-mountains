Text: "Silence isn't silent - at least not in the Dolomites. The silence there is\
  \ magnetic, alive, wiping around every jutting rock, every sharp turn, every flattened\
  \ plateau. It rings in your ear, a startling contrast to noise, because it\u2019\
  s not noise. It is a mediation, a whisper of a promise, a secret that settles in\
  \ skin like an ointment beginning to heal. \n\nI stood on one of the edges of Cortina\
  \ d'Ampezzo, one of the protruding rocks that was the perfect ledge to gaze across\
  \ a landscape that spanned on for miles. Breathless, the wind grabbing it from my\
  \ gaping mouth, I tried to recall the last time I\u2019d felt like this, the last\
  \ time silence engulfed my whole being. \n\nIt was then that I thought of my dad.\
  \ \n\nMy father is buried in Quantico National Cemetery. There is a silence there\
  \ but it is the vibration of the souls laid in the ground, their whispers of comfort\
  \ and love gliding around the headstones. It is at my father's grave where I felt\
  \ the same silence that these mountains are giving me now \u2013 the silence of\
  \ pure introspection. So as I drag my eyes across the rolling hills of northern\
  \ Italy, my thoughts reluctantly drift to my dad, wishing to the wind that he could\
  \ be there with me.\n\nThe scene in front of me looks like a screen painted carefully,\
  \ each detail given painstaking attention. Every tip of the mountains sharpened,\
  \ every curl of the clouds precise and hypnotizing. I let the surrealism of the\
  \ image calm me, extending that feeling into every crevice of my being, letting\
  \ it seep into my blood and bones, each and every part of myself now hyper-aware\
  \ of the knowledge that few have the ultimate privilege to stand upon that edge\
  \ \u2013 rocks, river, and reckless adventure below. With that comes the shaking\
  \ feeling of the ultimate quiet, the peaceful tranquility of feeling on top of the\
  \ world, worries and woes be damned. The cooling breeze caresses my skin, the only\
  \ trace of it is the pinpricks of goosebumps, a physical representation of the absolute\
  \ miracle I am witnessing. In that moment, I feel like I could rule the world. \n\
  \nIn that moment, I feel so small. \n\nThere was a part of me screaming that I was\
  \ unworthy of the scene in front of me, a humming question of why I was allowed\
  \ to glance out and be given this wonder of a view back. My thoughts drift back\
  \ to my father once more. There was an ache in my chest, hollow and sore, that wishes\
  \ he could be beside me upon these mountains.\n\nStanding there, I feel unworthy\
  \ to see the world because my father would not to see it with me.\n\nAnother breeze\
  \ hits me, pushing thoughts of my dad to the side as it pulls at the flowers, dragging\
  \ them in this direction and that. I am amazed how flowers are even able to bloom\
  \ so far up with nothing but hard stone and sharp wind as a comfort. They are able\
  \ to take root, cementing themselves in some place that seems impossible but they\
  \ do it anyway and without their presence, there would be something missing.\n\n\
  In that dancing field, I could see the magic of the mountain, the force of nature\
  \ herself \u2013 a physical representation that despite every hardship, there is\
  \ always growth. The flowers will find a way to take root through the stone, pushing\
  \ through until they are settled and can bloom once more. It seems impossible but\
  \ it is not. On that edge, I realize I am that flower, removed from the mountain,\
  \ but still growing, finding my roots and leaving behind something in return. On\
  \ that edge, I realize just as the wind follows me from Quantico to the Dolomites,\
  \ my father is with me wherever I go.\nWe descend the mountain - my legs aching\
  \ with the rigor I put them through. I follow my group, slowly, on my own, but not\
  \ alone. I would catch up with them soon enough. Right then, I wanted to spend my\
  \ last moments on that mountain dancing with the flowers in the wind"
