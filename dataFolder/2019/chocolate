Text: "He watched me intently with his stern eyes as he waited for me to answer. I\
  \ was about to break the awkward silence when Donata came running to my rescue,\
  \ exclaiming \u201CPapa, in Italian!\u201D My sixteen-year-old self struggled to\
  \ process his original question, compounded by my lack of familiarity with the Sicilian\
  \ accent.\n\nGathered in the kitchen of their bright and modestly decorated home,\
  \ I was acutely aware that all their eyes were on me. They were a large family,\
  \ as are many in the south.\n\u201CDon\u2019t you eat anymore?\u201D, the mother\
  \ asked me worriedly.\n\u201CThis feast could feed an army!\u201D, I thought.\n\
  Truth was I could not bear to swallow another bite, but I did not want to be rude.\
  \ I pondered the fact that my journey had taken me as far south as was possible\
  \ (Modica being located at the far southern end of Sicily) as I forced what was\
  \ left on my plate down my throat.\n\nDonata and her family had been waiting for\
  \ my arrival for some time now. A few months earlier she and her classmates were\
  \ the ones who flew over Italy to reach a small village in the north. The Po valley\
  \ landscape in those early summer days must have seemed flat and suffocating to\
  \ them. \nThis came to my mind on that distant, warm October day, as we entered\
  \ the dense tangle of narrow streets, bridges and steps that bewilder all but the\
  \ most astute locals. Modica climbed the banks of what was once the Modican river\
  \ with a degree of purpose and certainty that almost seemed human to me. Time flows\
  \ and with it brings change: the river dried up and men decided to build a road\
  \ there. It has been about fifteen years but I remember perfectly the colours, the\
  \ warm tones of brown, amber, sand, the charm of the peeling facades of the graciously\
  \ ageing buildings. The imposing castle that towered above the town stood in as\
  \ a background for the myriad of bell towers that sprouted between the roofs of\
  \ the houses and late-Baroque buildings. Amber was also the colour of Donata's skin:\
  \ her beautiful brown hair, her dark eyes, her pronounced nose and her fleshy mouth\
  \ burdened her with more years than were fair.\n\nThe smooth and delicate pastel\
  \ tones of Modica\u2019s ageing cobbled streets were contrasted by the rich, deep\
  \ and complex hues of its chocolate. During that trip, I would have been many occasions\
  \ to savour its unique and inebriating flavour; my first taste however lingers still.\
  \ One day Donata's mother took us downtown in her trusty old Fiat. Getting to the\
  \ shop, la dolcieria, posed a challenge; the streets of Modica demand a degree of\
  \ self-assurance, but certainly it was worth it. For a foodie like me it akin to\
  \ wandering into paradise: mountains of chocolate boxes on the shelves or grouped\
  \ in baskets of various sizes adorned the towering walls. An older lady in a white\
  \ coat and hat stood behind the counter from which all sorts of delicacies beckoned.\
  \ A warm smile spread across her face as we moved closer towards the cabinet.\n\n\
  The history of Modican chocolate or 'ciucculatta' is as lengthy and diverse as it\
  \ is complex. It is said that it was the Spaniards who introduced it in the 16th\
  \ century, but the Aztecs were the true creators. Its production distinguishes it\
  \ from other types of chocolate in that it takes place at low temperatures, so that\
  \ the crystals of sugar, strictly wheat or cane, do not melt. There are various\
  \ types depending on the spice that is added during its creation: the original recipe\
  \ calls for cinnamon or vanilla, but there are also variants with ginger and chilli.\
  \ It has a very special taste: the sugar crystals shatter between the teeth with\
  \ each bite, the intense taste of cocoa is inebriating, the aroma of spices linger\
  \ on the palate and allow your mind to wander.\n\nThen you open your eyes and you\
  \ realize you have never closed them. It is at that point that you understand that\
  \ Sicily, for better or for worse, stays inside you, with its contradictions, colours,\
  \ perfumes and people.\nAnd, of course, its chocolate."
