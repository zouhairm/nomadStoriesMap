Text: "There are holiday destinations that are so popular that they lose their attraction.\
  \ Crowded and chaotic, the appeal fades away. This was not the case when traveling\
  \ to Hanoi and Halong Bay in Vietnam. Entering the Hanoi International Airport of\
  \ Noi Bai, resembled a factory where the assembly line was out of order. Processing\
  \ was lengthy, organisation was long winding and application forms required information\
  \ that we could not provide to the officers. Yet, the haphazard setup worked. We\
  \ left the airport by 18.00pm and were heading to the heart of Hanoi. As we decided\
  \ to remain in the hub of the city and get a feel of the local environment, we booked\
  \ a hotel downtown. Hanoi Chic Hotel is tucked away in a side street, it surrounds\
  \ old and often dilapidated low rising shops on either side. Motor cycles are generally\
  \ parked at every nook and cranny, making walking a skilled art. Despite all that,\
  \ the hotel was comfortable enough with free breakfast and good service. The first\
  \ evening in the city was spent familiarizing the streets. With some beautiful artefacts,\
  \ architectural buildings, vibrant clothes and unique straw hats, were just some\
  \ of the many characteristics of Hanoi. The following day, we roamed the area of\
  \ alleyways, entering anything that caught our attention and stood to watch the\
  \ goings on in the neighbourhood. I was particularly enthralled when seeing people\
  \ traveling with Vietnamese carrying poles which balanced vegetables on two large\
  \ bowls. They dangled below on the sides and were attached to bamboo sticks that\
  \ rested on the shoulders of those carrying it. It was amazing watching them and\
  \ I wondered how people were able to handle the weight. Absorbing the culture on\
  \ that first day was a great way to be introduced to the city. The relaxed atmosphere\
  \ was calming and lazy and we enjoyed the many cafes scattered around the city.\
  \  The carvings of wooden stools, tables and colourful tiled floors were eye catching.\
  \ In the late afternoon, we walked to the Hoan Kiem Lake which had many benches\
  \ that looked towards the water and which many ventured out to enjoy the sunset.\
  \ Our night ended having dinner at Cau Go Vietnamese Cuisine restaurant which served\
  \ delicious Vietnamese food and had a great view looking across the lake. I recommend\
  \ any visitors to have a meal there however it might be wise to reserve a table\
  \ before hand as there are only a few seats that actually look across the lake.\
  \ Early morning next day, we travelled to Halong Bay, located on the northeast of\
  \ Vietnam. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, it attracts millions for its limestone\
  \ islands, rainforests as well as doing some activities such as kayaking and cave\
  \ exploration. The water is serene and the islands are breath-taking. If you decide\
  \ to see the various islands of Halong Bay, I would suggest investing on an overnight\
  \ stay on a junk boat. The ancient Chinese sailing ships are magnificent and in\
  \ the morning you might wake up to see the floating markets around the boat. While\
  \ the journey to Halong Bay can take as long as 5 hours from Hanoi, I believe it\
  \ is worth it. Our last day in Hanoi was spent taking a half day tour of the historical\
  \ and cultural places of the city. Our guides were of university students who were\
  \ part of the Hanoikids Voluntary English Club who wanted to practice their English.\
  \ These tours are completely free and only require for tourist to pay admission\
  \ fee, meals and drink, as well as transportation fees for you and the Hanoikids\u2019\
  \ guide. It was a rare occasion to listen to the two ladies who were assigned to\
  \ us. On our request, we decided to visit the Ho Chi Minh complex, Temple of Literature\
  \ and West lake area. The students were very well versed and spoke extremely well.\
  \ Their knowledge of the sites was also very impressive, and they took the time\
  \ to explain. All in all, the 4-day trip was a beautiful experience and I would\
  \ love to go back to explore more. The almost untouched country of the local culture\
  \ was very much alive, with great food, history and nature."
