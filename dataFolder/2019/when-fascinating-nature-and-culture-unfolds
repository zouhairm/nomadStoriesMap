Text: I have been to many places in india. But nature always seem to amaze me. Nature
  coupled with man made creations has taken the beauty of some part of india to another
  level. The dudhsagar fall which i recently visited with falls falling from the state
  of karnataka to in the jungles of Goa. And a railway line passing in between is
  surreal. The bon jesus the best cathedral in the city was a thing of immense peace
  and satisfaction. I could have sat their all day and watched the candles as they
  burn with a message of peace. Mar de goa i.e. three wise man was a fort first owned
  by the portugese in north goa. Which is now a tourist attraction is immense with
  the arabian sea floating infront of it. Hopping to the local bar with my buddy we
  interacted with various nationalities, talked to them listened to their stories,
  that cultural exchange is something i crave. Goa was a portugese colony in the past.
  So every thing there has a portugal feel to it. The charpora fort , the view from
  it just mesmerised me to another extent, the beach flowinf 60 feet down and the
  shacks and cottages u can see from there was a site to behold. India is beautiful
  specially the north east of india, the 7 sister states. I have travelled many places.
  And travelling has so much to do interacting with the locals, knowing their culture,
  their food, their houses and it's archtitectures, their past time, their local speciality.
  And ofcourse visiting places of great importance.
