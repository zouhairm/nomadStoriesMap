Text: "Whether we know it or not, every journey we embark on is a quest. I've always\
  \ loved exploring places and uncovering hidden myths. Last year, I decided to take\
  \ a trip to Jaipur- The Pink City of India to attend the world famous Jaipur Literature\
  \ Festival. It was then, when I was making a list of all the places I wanted to\
  \ go to that I found Bhangarh fort- the most Haunted fort in all of Asia. It was\
  \ a couple of hours away from Jaipur. I read about it and it immediately drew me\
  \ in. After all, who doesn't love myths and horror stories? I knew I couldn't miss\
  \ this chance so I kept one day aside just to visit this fort. Before going, I had\
  \ read a lot about its history and how it came to be known as a place no one would\
  \ venture to after sundown. Locals called this fort a \"Bhoot bangla\" which means\
  \ \"haunted palace\". Fast forward to the day I travelled to this place- when we\
  \ reached there, my driver told us to be back before sundown because according to\
  \ him, no one had returned when they stayed past that time inside the fort. Spooky,\
  \ I know. I took it with a grain of salt because I am not a big believer of superstitions-\
  \ I was just curious and the only way to know the truth about the Haunted Ghosts\
  \ of Bhangarh was to visit the place. There was a story about a Tantrik who fell\
  \ in love with Princess Ratnavati and used his magic to win her over but it's said\
  \ that the princess got to know of his evil plans and  ordered the guards to have\
  \ him executed. Before the Tantrik died, he cursed the people living in the fort\
  \ to die and the dwellers of the surrounding village to remain without a roof forever.\
  \ Till date, no one has been able to rebuild the fort or live over there.  People\
  \ have claimed to have heard wailing of women and screams of the ghosts of Bhangarh's\
  \ past. Ghostly apparitions and strange noises have been reported by the locals\
  \ of this area. \nThe entrance and the lane leading to the fort is bumpy and cobbled,\
  \ filled with craters and the age-old banyan trees add to the eerie feel of the\
  \ fort. Most of the blocks of an ancient market, Johri Bazaar have narrow staircases\
  \ that lead to nowhere, to the topmost floors that don't exist today. Looking at\
  \ the intact temples and haunted ruins, I wondered if the stories of the spirits\
  \ were true. An incident that still spooks me even a year after the visit is- when\
  \ my aunt and I tried to take a picture inside the fort, the picture came up blank.\
  \ The area was shady, and it gave me chills but there was enough sunlight coming\
  \ in for a decent picture. Both of us took turns clicking the picture, I changed\
  \ the settings of my camera to accommodate the settings and even asked someone else\
  \ to click a picture from their camera. We clicked a picture just a little away\
  \ from there ( with the same settings and light) and the picture came out like a\
  \ normal one would. While we were passing by, we heard another group discussing\
  \ how even they couldn't get a picture in that area and I thought to myself, \"\
  Maybe I do understand what all those people were talking about.\" As we continued\
  \ walking, we came across a wall, one of the only ones intact- there were bold,\
  \ red handprints on the wall. There was something so sinister about those that it\
  \ was difficult to tear my eyes away from that. I could imagine thousands of scenarios\
  \ in my head about what could have happened. Later, we came to know that those handprints\
  \ were rumored to belong to the Princess of the fort who was one of the first people\
  \ to die after the Tantric's curse. Suddenly, the stories I had heard and read didn't\
  \ seem cooked up anymore. I had ventured to the dilapidated fort to satiate my curiosity\
  \ and I came out with an eerie feeling that I couldn't wait to escape."
