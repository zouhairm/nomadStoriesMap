Text: "In darkness, I begin to climb the mountain. I've hardly seen the moon all year,\
  \ but now it shines through the forest, allowing me to turn off my headlamp as I\
  \ climb higher.\n     As my body warms with the effort, I peel off layers and stuff\
  \ them in my pack. But when I reach the treeline, moving beyond the forest and into\
  \ the sky, the weather turns.\n     My frozen hands almost slip as I pull myself\
  \ up boulder after boulder, my body stretching to reach handholds that don't exist.\
  \ I put my trust in the mountain, not knowing if I'm destined to make the return\
  \ journey.\n     The wind picks up. I stand on a stable ledge and turn around, pulling\
  \ cold air into my lungs as my jaw drops at the sight: all of Maine, perhaps all\
  \ of the world, glowing in the soft orange light of a late September morning.\n\
  \     I can only look for so long. I can feel the storm coming, and I'm still two\
  \ grueling vertical miles from the summit of Mount Katahdin, from the end of the\
  \ Appalachian Trail.\n     I pull myself up to The Gateway, the end of the most\
  \ difficult part of the climb and the beginning of The Tablelands, a rock-strewn\
  \ victory walk to the summit. But I can't taste the victory yet. I can no longer\
  \ see the path to the end of this journey I've been on for six months.\n     With\
  \ a howl almost too quiet for what it signifies, a sudden rush of clouds rolls in\
  \ and entirely shrouds the mountain, closing me in, erasing the 360 degree views\
  \ of Maine's jagged mountains and vast lakes. Now there is nothing but the mist,\
  \ my boots, and my eyes straining to see ten feet in front of me.\n     I fight\
  \ the urge to fall to my hands and knees and crawl the rest of the way. The wind\
  \ is so strong that I imagine every time I lift a boot, I might be picked up and\
  \ blown away.\n     I keep fighting, looking ahead. I think back to the early days\
  \ of my hike, to North Carolina, when the weather was cold, but nothing like this.\
  \ I remember the conversation I had with a German woman, one of many people I'd\
  \ meet from around the world, all drawn by the siren song of the longest footpath\
  \ on Earth.\n     The woman's trail name was \"Brick\". Almost everyone who thru-hikes\
  \ the Appalachian Trail acquires a trail name, gifted to them by other hikers, by\
  \ themselves, by the journey. Mine is \"Story\". Sitting with Brick, I both loved\
  \ and felt baffled by this world of people walking, running away, using assumed\
  \ names, banishing their \"real\" lives.\n     \"It's strange, isn't it?\" said\
  \ Brick. \"Just walking in one direction. Usually you walk for a bit and then turn\
  \ around, go back to your car or something. But out here, you never look back.\"\
  \n     For 185 days, I have not looked back. I have trudged up mountains, brown\
  \ with dead leaves and deep mud. I have bounded down hills, green and vibrant in\
  \ their summer glory. I have faced black bears and rattlesnakes, looked in their\
  \ shining eyes and kept on walking. I have suffered spider bites and sickness, felt\
  \ my skin slick with sweat and my muscles seized from exertion. I have climbed mountains\
  \ from dawn until dusk every day for half a year. I've carried my life on my back\
  \ and slept in the woods. I've walked 2,190 miles. I've traveled from Georgia to\
  \ Maine.\n     On this last push to the summit, I think of my first day, on top\
  \ of Springer Mountain in Georgia, questioning whether I could really do this. Now\
  \ I've almost done it.\n     I may not be able to see anything, but I know which\
  \ direction to move in: forward. My feet scramble, my arms reach out to prevent\
  \ a fall this close to the end. Blinded with melting frost dripping from my hat,\
  \ I squint and can finally make out a wooden sign, desolate, alone on top of the\
  \ world, waiting for me to touch it after years of dreaming. I rush forward into\
  \ the mist."
