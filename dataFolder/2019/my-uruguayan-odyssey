Text: "Last year my supervisor asked me, if I would like to work in Uruguay for a\
  \ year. I dived headlong into the unknown with a \"yes\". Apart from having seen\
  \ the name on a map, I did not know anything about the tiny South American nation.\
  \ However, having dreamt of visiting South America for several years, I was excited\
  \ to make it a reality at last. \n\nI could not help but feel like I had reached\
  \ \"a land far, far away\", after flying from Bangalore to Dubai (4 hours), Dubai\
  \ to Sao Paulo (15 hours) and finally Sao Paulo to Montevideo (3 hours). Now, having\
  \ spent several month here, the stark contrast between India and Uruguay in almost\
  \ every aspect of life still amazes me. \n\nHola vs. Namaste \nIndians are not a\
  \ touchy-feely bunch. We tend to avoid physical contact unless absolutely necessary.\
  \ Our traditional greeting \"namaste\" is accompanied by the joining of both palms.\
  \ So, even before landing in Uruguay, when I was greeted by my new manager, who\
  \ happened to be returning from a vacation in Brazil, with an enthusiastic \"hola\"\
  , a hug and a kiss, it was a bit of a cultural shock. On landing, her whole family\
  \ including husband, daughter and father-in-law repeated the procedure as they ushered\
  \ me into their car and dropped me off at my accommodation. This was followed up\
  \ by hugs and kisses from my whole team on my first day at work and most days after\
  \ that. \u200BIt is still strange to be hugged and kissed, particularly by strangers,\
  \ but I know I will miss Uruguayan tactile expression of emotions.\n\nTo eat or\
  \ not to eat\nI feel like I have been on a \"spice detox\" over the last few months.\
  \ Spice is the heart of Indian cuisine and sometimes brain, lungs and kidney too.\
  \ Uruguayans are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Having been to a few countries\
  \ in South America and other parts of the world, I am yet to find a nation as averse\
  \ to spices as Uruguay. Over the last few months, I have been bringing home cooked\
  \ Indian meals to office and testing them out on my Uruguayan friends progressively\
  \ reducing the amount of spices only to realize that the only level they can tolerate\
  \ is zero. \n\u200B\n\u200BBeing a vegetarian is another major challenge as the\
  \ staple diet in Uruguay is beef and pork. I come from a family of vegetarians.\
  \ This means that none of us has ever eaten meat or fish - an alien concept for\
  \ Uruguayans. Over time, I have been forced to appreciate the taste of ingredient\
  \ themselves. Any discussion of Uruguayan food is incomplete without mentioning\
  \  dulce-de-leche. Having a huge sweet tooth, dulce-de-leche, sweetened condensed\
  \ milk used as a jam, has become a heartfelt addition to my staple diet.\n\nEnglish\
  \ is optional\nIndians have wholehearted embraced English. Whether this English\
  \ has anything to do with the actual English language is debatable, but it is possible\
  \ to get by without knowing the local language at least in the bigger cities. This\
  \ is a choice as well as a necessity because every Indian state has a distinct language,\
  \ which in turn has several dialects. So, English or Hinglish (a combination of\
  \ national language Hindi and English) has unwittingly become  the language connecting\
  \ people from different regions of the country. My misguided assumptions about the\
  \ popularity of English were harshly shattered as soon as I landed in South America.\
  \ With the whole continent, except Brazil, speaking a common language, a majority\
  \ of people see no good reason to learn English. As with everything else, I have\
  \ been forced to learn basic Spanish words, which along with hand gestures allow\
  \ me to understand and be understood.\n\nI think homogeneity vs. diversity sums\
  \ up the differences between Uruguay and India. I could not have chosen a better\
  \ location to gain a new perspective. From stunning beaches to some of the most\
  \ helpful and friendly people, Uruguay has a lot to recommend it. I am so grateful\
  \ that my life's path led me to this beautiful country."
