  . We see this manifest like no other experience in our endeavor to conduct an architectural\
  \ workshop in Majuli in Assam, India. En route to the largest river island in the\
  \ world, we find ourselves contemplating the odds of returning alive, several times\
  \ over.\n\nWhen we reach the Guwahati Bus Depot at midnight, it is pouring heavily.\
  \ The depot is relatively isolated but overnight buses are still running. Earlier\
  \ that evening, we have met with Rishi. Having made a learning center on the river\
  \ island, he enlightens us that building a school and community shelter is our only\
  \ shot at collaborating with the local government there. Running on a tight budget,\
  \ this remains critical to our endeavor.\nPresently, we stand perplexed and drenched\
  \ in the rain, staring into the dead of night, one question racing across our minds-\
  \ has it already flooded in Majuli?\nDespite overwhelming doubt, we board the overnight\
  \ bus to Jorhat, a sleepy little town by River Brahmaputra. Leaping into the unknown\
  \ is not much of a choice - the fee has been collected, and participants have booked\
  \ their flight tickets. Hostile weather conditions prove to be the least of our\
  \ problems - Majuli is wrought with high intensity earthquakes, annual floods and\
  \ consequent soil erosion.\nA violent screeching of brakes leaves us scrambling\
  \ at the Jorhat City Bus Stand, in the wee hours of morning. The rickshaw ride,\
  \ thereafter, culminates in an unfamiliar routine of people, cargo and vehicles\
  \ climbing onto a giant diesel ferry at the Nematighat Port.\nSailing across the\
  \ glassy, turbulent expanse of the mighty Brahmaputra, the ferry eventually lodges\
  \ itself into the Kamalabari Ghat. We share a sigh of relief - the floods are yet\
  \ to arrive - the pastoral Majuli is to be our abode now.\nChecking into a resort,\
  \ we wait the whole week as it patters relentlessly on the corrugated roof of our\
  \ bamboo cottage. During this period, clouds return intermittently, casting a spell\
  \ gloomy enough to contemplate returning home.\nOn the fifth day, however, right\
  \ before evening, there is a sliver of hope. The rains pause and we start our correspondence\
  \ with Rishi\u2019s friend at the District Commissioner\u2019s Office. Ultimately\
  \ negotiating a site, we prepare for a visit.\nThe morning after sees a lone jeep\
  \ getting off the road, and onto a raw trail that leads into the remote Bonoria\
  \ Chapori - a low lying region in the island\u2019s unique landscape, where the\
  \ river inundates to leave fertile soil, utilized for agriculture. It is an expanse\
  \ of green stretching to a horizon lined with trees. A dilapidated old shed has\
  \ served as a makeshift school for 25 children of the Mishing tribe, since the 1930s.\n\
  The place is rumored to be frequented by herds of majestic elephants that swim across\
  \ from the forests of Kaziranga. Since the location is so remote, we would receive\
  \ assistance from the government, with transportation and access to electricity\
  \ for tooling and assembly. With floods around the corner, it will become difficult\
  \ to access the site. How would construction materials be procured, then?\nLeft\
  \ clueless again, we leap into the unknown - the participants arrive and design\
  \ discussions are initiated. Necessity being the mother of innovation, acute shortage\
  \ of resources informs several decisions, rather than causing hindrances. Bricks\
  \ being expensive, foundations are built with a cheaper, burnt variant. Bamboo is\
  \ sourced locally, smoked and treated for termites. For children to have a feeling\
  \ of home in a place of learning, features of a typical Mishing home are integrated\
  \ into the school, with structurally enhanced response to earthquakes and floods.\
  \ Artisans from the tribal community engage in design and building processes, thus\
  \ fostering a sense of ownership and social inclusiveness. The structure is raised\
  \ on stilts, with a floating floor-plate cantilevered atop. Walls are woven from\
  \ split bamboo allowing seamless ventilation. We race through heavy rains, making\
  \ the gabled roof. As its parts are being deployed on-site, Brahmaputra flash-floods\
  \ into the Chapori. Too immersed in completing the roof, we overlook the simultaneous\
  \ confirmation of auspicious rumors - the elephants arrive in all their fantastic\
  \ glory. Murphy\u2019s Law has, by now, magically morphed to Que Sera Sera \u2013\
  \ what will be, will be."
