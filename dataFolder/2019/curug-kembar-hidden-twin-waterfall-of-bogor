Text: "Curug Kembar, Hidden Twin Waterfall That We Didn't Expect to find!\n\nI didn\u2019\
  t expect to find this beautiful journey. Yup, I didn\u2019t expect it!\nSo, last\
  \ January I and office collegues planned to enjoy and celebrate new year eve\u2019\
  s together. For your information, i\u2019ve been living in South Tangerang since\
  \ august 2018 and havent explored this city yet. This city quite near with Bogor\
  \ City which is famous with their tourism object, their greenish scenary and their\
  \ fresh air. \n\nThe day before New Year Eve\u2019s, 30th December 2018 we decided\
  \ to go to our rent villa in Bogor before the police blocade the street in the night\
  \ of new year eve. Because a night before new year will be so much traffic and impossible\
  \ for us to move our car. And finally, we did it. We arrived on 30th December after\
  \ striving pass the traffic through. \nWe arrived at the villa and enjoying the\
  \ breathaking view of mountain. So green and fresh. The feeling of hunger was common\
  \ feeling when you are in a fresh and cold place. Night was spent well together,\
  \ singing , roasting corn, sweet potatoes, chit-chat etc.\nFresh air in the morning\
  \ of 31st December was satisfying me too. Just suddenly we know that the location\
  \ of our villa that we rent is near with one of famous waterfall in Bogor. We called\
  \ it Curug Kembar or Twin Waterfall, located in Ciburial area, Bogor. We\u2019re\
  \ so excited, before knowing the track to reach them of cource.\n\nSo, after had\
  \ breakfast together, and surely without bathing, we decided to go. Some of us in\
  \ the car, some using motorcycle. With the guide from local man which also our villa\
  \ keeper, finally we\u2019re arriving. No, not arriving at the site directly. It\u2019\
  s still hundred meters uphill track to reach the locket.\nThis is it! After bought\
  \ the cheap ticket, less than 1$ for each person, we\u2019re ready to go to see\
  \ the waterfall. And, we didn\u2019t expect to find a very long track (far enough),\
  \ hiking, passing clear water of rivers, fresh air. Unbelievable! We almost giving\
  \ up in the mid of track when our guide already far ahead from us.\n\n\u201CHow\
  \ far,Sir?\u201Dalways be the same question after passing the uphill track.\n\u201C\
  After this, once more hill again.\u201D Same answer too.\n\nWe just don\u2019t know\
  \ how long the track will be. How could we\u2019re not giving up when there were\
  \ two babies with us too. Babies under two years old with us! Fortunately the babies\
  \ not being fussy during hiking. They just silently even fell asleep on back of\
  \ their father.  \nAround an hour tracking, finally we\u2019re arrived. We feel\
  \ so happy and hungry at the same time. There are two waterfall there, correctly.\
  \ They both just separated in meters. One waterfall looks so orange and a bit smell\
  \ of iron metal there. But but but, the other one was so breathaking!\nTesting the\
  \ depth, then jump to the niche under the waterfall. Yeah, it\u2019s niche enough\
  \ become a little pool with cold water inside. The depth is beyond of our expectations.\
  \ My feet even just can reach the edge of the niche. The guys of cource go to the\
  \ center of basin, right under the waterfall. Screaming happily and getting blue\
  \ because the very cold water of waterfall. The babies seems happy also playing\
  \ the water near the niche. Taking pictures, frame the moments together, become\
  \ a beautiful experience for me. A good experience enjoying un expected little trip\
  \ which gave me beautiful photographs in my life. We all expect spend the new year\
  \ eve\u2019s well together and we did. We thought that we\u2019ll just see the fireworks\
  \ and enjoying togetherness on that New Year Eve. And didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ a beautiful hidden twin waterfall which satisfying our days before back to the\
  \ routine. We\u2019re happy!"
