Text: "It\u2019s possible no one outside Slovenia really knows how to pronounce the\
  \ name of its capital, Ljubljana. (As far as I can tell, it\u2019s \u201CLoob-yana\u201D\
  .)\nThat in itself makes the country feel exotic, as though you\u2019ve stumbled\
  \ upon one of Europe\u2019s best-kept secrets, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly\
  \ popular.\nSlovenia is tucked away in a sun-drenched corner of the Julian Alps\
  \ next to Italy and Austria, and it was reasonably anonymous to Australians until\
  \ Instagram put it right into the palms of our hands.\nAll I knew about it was that\
  \ it was home to Bled, a pretty town with a church on an island in the middle of\
  \ an incredibly blue lake.\nIt\u2019s the kind of place with flowers in the window\
  \ boxes, where people call greetings across the street and you can almost always\
  \ hear a horse neighing in a nearby paddock.\nThe walk around the lake takes about\
  \ an hour and a half \u2014 longer if you stop to have a swim or hike up to the\
  \ Osojnica viewpoint \u2014 and it really is as pretty as a postcard.\nThere\u2019\
  s a castle perched on the cliffs on the northern bank, while the western edge backs\
  \ onto the lush and green Triglavski National Park. The town thrives on tourism,\
  \ coming to life during the European summer from May to September.\nOver the course\
  \ of a few days, I met cheerful middle-aged Italians looking for a change of scenery,\
  \ German families teaching their children to swim, and excitable Irish backpackers\
  \ going canyoning and rafting. \nOh, and a jolly local vendor who called, \u201C\
  Ice cream! Come and try my fresh ice cream!\u201D to every single passer-by at a\
  \ street market for the better part of 12 straight hours.\n(To be fair, he whipped\
  \ it up on the spot with strawberries, cream, champagne and liquid nitrogen, which\
  \ was pretty impressive.)\nThe heat, however, is something else.\nAs Australians,\
  \ it\u2019s tempting to smirk when people tell you a place is hot.\nRegardless of\
  \ what the thermometer throws at you, it\u2019s easy to think: \u201COh, come on.\
  \ How bad can it be? Nah, it\u2019s way hotter at home\u201D.\nSlovenia, at the\
  \ height of summer, has temperatures in the mid-30s with an almost tropical humidity\
  \ that causes cracking thunderstorms every afternoon.\nUnless you come from the\
  \ Top End or Tropical North Queensland, you\u2019re in for a pretty rude shock \u2014\
  \ woe unto those who get caught in one of the torrential downpours without cover.\
  \ \nThat said, the rest of the day is perfect for adventuring.\nIt\u2019s a comfortable\
  \ 4 kilometre bike ride from Bled to Vintgar Gorge, a place so pretty it almost\
  \ looks like a Hollywood fantasy movie set, which offers cool relief.\nIt takes\
  \ about an hour to traipse along the 1.6 kilometre boardwalk, which edges along\
  \ the cliffs above the crystal clear, rushing river.\nIf you enter the gorge at\
  \ Podhom and exit at Zasip (walking west to east), you\u2019ll finish at a waterfall\
  \ with a pool deep enough to take a very refreshing dip. Wear your bathers under\
  \ your clothes so you can jump straight in.\nThe way back is a perfect opportunity\
  \ to stop at a tiny local cafe and sample the region\u2019s famous cream cake, kremsnita,\
  \ which is made from sinful layers of puff pastry, custard, cream, more pastry and\
  \ icing sugar.\n(No, this is not the place to visit if you\u2019re watching your\
  \ waistline.)\nAs a slightly longer day-trip, or when your time in Bled comes to\
  \ an end, Ljubljana is an hour down the road and definitely worth a visit. \nThere\u2019\
  s a very clear distinction between the leafy, cobblestoned old city, and the industrial-looking\
  \ suburbs built while Slovenia was part of Yugoslavia.\nIt\u2019s easy to while\
  \ away a day or two wandering the streets, dining at the restaurants along the river\
  \ and sampling some of the excellent ice cream.\nJust keep a look out for those\
  \ thunderstorms."
