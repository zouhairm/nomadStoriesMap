Text: "It was 9pm on a Wednesday night, late March in London so the weather was still\
  \ a tad nippy. The atmosphere starts dying down as the after work rush of corporate\
  \ city workers leave the three storey, Covent Garden pub. It's my first night as\
  \ a bar maid, I had just flown back from Germany a few days prior and managed to\
  \ score this gig that morning. I was running a little low on funds and figured,\
  \ why not find an easy job for the next two months before I set off again to the\
  \ Italian coastline of Positano. As I make my way around, stacking empty glasses\
  \ in my arms, I hear the voice of a Canadian gentleman behind me, \"excuse me, what\
  \ time do you guys close?\" He asks, a small half smile across his face, rug sack\
  \ in tow. \n\"No clue, it's my first night\" I respond hastily, a little embarrassed\
  \ I don't know the answer. He chuckles and asks what my accent is, \"Australian\
  \ of course\" I reply, proudly. Fast forward throughout the night & I find myself\
  \ getting lost in conversation with him, and having to remind myself I'm now at\
  \ work. He proceeds to ask me for a drink when I knock off & I accept but let him\
  \ know I'm not entirely sure when that will be, it could be late. He ensures me\
  \ he'll wait & to my surprise he does. \nSo I take him down to the only pub I know\
  \ of, right near Soho & the energy between us is hard to ignore. He was intriguing,\
  \ intelligent and of course, extremely handsome. We discussed how we were both solo\
  \ travellers, myself being on a one way ticket only a month in and him just over\
  \ visiting friends. He told me how we wasn't supposed to be in London but he had\
  \ missed his connecting flight, which led him to the pub I was working in as he\
  \ looked for somewhere to charge his phone and get a beer. We laughed at the coincidence\
  \ of us meeting and spent the rest of the night dancing and laughing. Fast forward\
  \ two weeks and we had spent every day together. Two strangers, from two different\
  \ sides of the world, yet it felt so incredibly familiar. We took a trip down to\
  \ Brighton and I played tour guide through London, which consisted only of the spots\
  \ I had visited briefly at the beginning of my trip. Once the two weeks was up,\
  \ we had to say goodbye. Him back to Canada, and me staying in London with Italy\
  \ on the horizon. \nIt was heartbreaking to say the least, but we vowed to stay\
  \ in touch and that we did. He would Facetime me every day, showing me his small\
  \ town of Winnipeg, Manitoba and I would speak of life in London. One night, after\
  \ Facetiming for what felt like forever (it had only been two months) he told me\
  \ he had sent me an email. I proceeded to open my email & there it was, a flight\
  \ itinerary to Winnipeg, Manintoba. Tears begun swelling in my eyes as his smile\
  \ grew wider. We had spoken about the possibility of me heading over there but \
  \ it was yet to play into reality... until now. It was surreal, but yet felt so\
  \ incredibly right. People told us we were crazy and heck, they were probably right,\
  \ but we didn't care.\nAnother month passes and I'm leaving London, waving goodbye\
  \ to my room mate, of who I'm unsure when I will see again, for a whole new adventure\
  \ - one of love and one full of even more unknowns."
