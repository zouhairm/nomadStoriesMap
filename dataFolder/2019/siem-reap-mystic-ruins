Text: "Little had I known about Cambodia 'The Kingdom of Wonder' before I planned\
  \ my travel in April of 2018. Information available was overwhelming and what caught\
  \ my attention was a the majestic historic grandeur of Siem Reap and it's Angkor\
  \ ruins. A city that proudly names itself after defeating the neighbour; Siep Reap\
  \ literally meaning Defeating the Thai, was then the capital of one of worlds strongest\
  \ and richest regimes The Khmer. I began my exciting journey on the Remorque the\
  \ Cambodian version of the tuk-tuk.\n\nOne feels like time travelling when you enter\
  \ these temples. Each temple has its own calmness, aura and each its own story.\
  \ The legand has it that in Khmer dynasty each King's ultimate goal of life was\
  \ to dedicate a temple for his parents respectively and hence there are so many\
  \ temples in the complex. There is a lot common in each the biggest temples that\
  \ I visited but the same time each one has its own uniqueness. \n\nThe biggest three\
  \ temples in Angkor wat are : Angkor Wat, Ta prohm and the Bayan temple. The first\
  \ temple I visited was the Iconic Angkor Wat. The grandeur of the temple was amazing,\
  \ built in the 12th century it is indeed an architectural gem. it consists of compounds\
  \ for meetings, holding prayers and religious ceremonies and at the top the main\
  \ golden Budhha statue which is the main compound of Angkor Wat. One of the most\
  \ remarkable thing about Angkor Wat temple is that there are many Budhha statues\
  \ with there heads cut off. The legend has it that in ancient times the jewels and\
  \ treasures were put inside these statues and hence the invaders cut them off in\
  \ hopes of finding the treasure.\nThe second temple I visited was the Ta Prohm,\
  \ the nature has taken over this temple with huge branches and roots of the trees.\
  \ This is also famously known as the Tomb Raider temple as Angelina Jolie starter\
  \ movie was shot at this very temple. \nMoving on I visited the most beautiful temple\
  \ in the entire Angkor wat complex. It is known as the Smiling face temple as there\
  \ are 216 huge among faces charges on the blocks of rocks. From each direction the\
  \ temple looks exactly the same such is the brilliance. The walls inscriptions from\
  \ right to left dipict an entire story of the wars between two kingdoms which is\
  \ Noteworthy.\nThe entire trip was an enriching experience and definitely a leap\
  \ into the unknown."
