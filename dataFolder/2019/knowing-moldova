Text: "My story Begin when my grandfather from Italy came, then we started to visit\
  \ all  Moldova for knowing her ,If you decide you are brave enough to cross the\
  \ border into Moldova,  Chisinau would be the very first surprise. A city of contrasts,\
  \ where the old and the new live together. Expect good hearty food, with multi-ethnic\
  \ and and folklore restaurants.\nBut the best surprise of all is the wine. Red,\
  \ white, rose or sparkling, Moldova has them all. The wineries are sprinkled all\
  \ around the country, but especially South of Chisinau. Wineries with tradition,\
  \ wineries that are real underground cities (with street names and cinemas) or small,\
  \ family owned ones, they charm you to a point you just can\u2019t help add bottles\
  \ to your already extensive car trunk wine collection. We definitely couldn\u2019\
  t.The most impressive winery is Cricova, with its underground tunnels that reach\
  \ a total length of 120 km. They specialise in sparkling wine made with the old\
  \ method, called \u201CM\xE9thode Traditionelle\u201D, but their reds are just as\
  \ good.If Cricova impresses with its grandeur, then Et Cetera impressed us with\
  \ its authenticity and passion. This small gem, set in the middle of a vine and\
  \ lavender field, simply cannot be missed if you\u2019re visiting Moldova. We\u2019\
  ve already set a date to come back, with family and friends. After touring the wineries,\
  \ make sure you still have some time and energy to spare, so you can visit Moldova\u2019\
  s iconic village, Orheiul Vechi (Old Orhei). You will step into a well preserved\
  \ traditional village with painted gates, fountains and blue houses, set in a natural\
  \ amphitheatre of limestone rock, with caves still functioning as chapels. Prepare\
  \ for an authentic experience. Moldova is not what we expected (and if you go there,\
  \ you simply cannot miss visiting Tiraspol, for a \u201Cback to communist USSR\u201D\
  \ feeling), and it certainly won\u2019t be what you expect. It\u2019s much more.\
  \ The only way to understand it is to visit it, just like we did. \n\nAnother reason\
  \ to visit this country is Feast on a budget ,Where can you indulge in a three-course\
  \ meal, with local wine, for under $10? Moldova. From casual spots in Comrat to\
  \ restaurants offering traditional or international style cuisine in Chi\u015Fin\u0103\
  u, meals will hardly make a dent in the wallet.The country is known for meat-heavy\
  \ dishes, however there\u2019s plenty of lighter options and vegetarian dishes.\
  \ Be sure to sample Moldovan-style borsch which can be ordered with or without meat.\n\
  Dining with my fellow travelers was a great way to sample a large variety of local\
  \ foods, including Pl\u0103cint\u0103, a savory pastry available with a variety\
  \ of fillings including salty cheeses or meats. If you\u2019re on the road and not\
  \ sure what to eat, look for an Andy\u2019s Pizza. It\u2019s a local chain that\
  \ offers pizza, Moldovan specialties, salads, and cocktails.Insider tip: restaurant\
  \ service is much slower than in Western Europe. They aren\u2019t ignoring you,\
  \ it\u2019s just a different pace. Be sure to leave enough time if you have a bus\
  \ or train to catch. And also do not forget to visit Discover hidden monasteries!\n\
  If climbing to the top of a hill to visit an ancient cave monastery isn\u2019t on\
  \ your bucket list, it should be. The Orhei Vechi monastery is perched high atop\
  \ a hill overlooking the R\u0103ut River. The structure was dug by Orthodox monks\
  \ in the 13th century, abandoned in the 18th century, and is currently home to a\
  \ few solitary monks once again.Walk outside to the cliff\u2019s ledge and place\
  \ a coin in the naturally pitted limestone structure for good luck. Just don\u2019\
  t look down if you are afraid of heights! When there, me and my familly walked,\
  \ dined and danced alongside locals in modern cities and rural villages. I sampled\
  \ food and drink much, much better than anticipated. I learned about the complicated\
  \ history and the compelling culture. All this, and so much more.It may take a little\
  \ effort before locals warm to you, but they will.\nAnd don\u2019t wait until this\
  \ country gets discovered by travelers worldwide. Now is the time to visit."
