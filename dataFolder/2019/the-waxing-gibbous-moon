Text: "The Waxing Gibbous Moon\nIt was a sunny Autumn morning - bright as always is\
  \ in tropical countries. I saw Usha walking at me smiling in the quiet lobby of\
  \ Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi hotel, \u201CI liked your last night\u2019s presentation\
  \ on illegal land grabbing in Bangladesh.\u201D I smiled back, \u201CI believe,\
  \ your speech on the conservation of nature was better than that of mine.\u201D\
  \ After attending a one-week conference organized by Asia Pacific Research Network\
  \ we left Vietnam. This is not my story; it begins after one year when Usha invited\
  \ me to visit her in Kathmandu for two weeks offering accommodation, food and of\
  \ course the fresh Himalayan air for free due to the friendship we grew in Hanoi.\
  \ I reached Kathmandu on April 7, 2005. Everything was new around me: mountain chill,\
  \ people speaking Nepalese, tapered roads, the different type of birds, unknown\
  \ trees, even the hovering clouds. As I like untouched nature, we planned to visit\
  \ Rukum: a mid-western remote district, 280 km away from Kathmandu. Nepal was suffering\
  \ from Maoist insurgency from 1996 when the United People\u2019s Front (UPF) declared\
  \ People\u2019s War to dethrone king Gyanendra. On February 1, 2005, the king resolved\
  \ the cabinet and took absolute control over the government announcing a national\
  \ state of emergency. It made the Maoists launch an arms rebellion and it was not\
  \ safe for the foreigners to visit rural areas.      \nAt that time there was no\
  \ road connection from Rukum to other parts of Nepal. There was a small airstrip\
  \ where only the tiny aircrafts can land. On 10th April we reached Rukum airport\
  \ at sunset, took a taxi, reached Yeati hotel at the city center and after taking\
  \ a nice shower was abducted by 6/7 armed men. They took us to a nearby village\
  \ by a microbus and dumped in a large wooden room with a narrow, dark passage towards\
  \ a primitive washroom. At about midnight, in lieu of beating with Nim logs, they\
  \ treated us with the Thali, a traditional dish, for the supper: but surely not\
  \ the Last Supper as I thought it to be. They seized our cell phones and ascertained\
  \ our journalistic identity. We were waiting for some people to come and interrogate\
  \ us with the allegation of spying on the king\u2019s behalf. Two unarmed Maoists\
  \ entered our room at around 3 am and asked me to follow them. Usha sprang up, \u201C\
  I will also go with you.\u201D That produced a strange result; they left and never\
  \ came back. We passed our longest night ever sitting on the floor and in the morning,\
  \ they took us to another place, which was again a one-hour journey by the hills.\
  \  \nThe champ troopers produced us before their local leader Chiranjibi (I knew\
  \ his name later) apparently for a fatal trial. Usha, still vibrant at her 30s,\
  \ initiated talking in Nepali, delightfully and spiritedly; as if nothing had happened.\
  \ Surprisingly the situation changed within ten minutes. I could hardly understand\
  \ their conversation but realized that it is not on our beheading process. Their\
  \ intonation seemed indicative of a consensus between the two parties. Usha, in\
  \ her language, was telling, \u201CMoo Moist lie maya garchu\u201D (I love Maoists).\
  \ I also had a scope to participate in that conversation when Chiranjibi came to\
  \ know that I do not speak Nepali; he started talking to me in English.\nAt the\
  \ first chance, I echoed Usha and attained Chiranjibi\u2019s empathy. I did not\
  \ forget either to mention that I had also been a member of the Bangladesh Communist\
  \ Party throughout my student life. Delighted he advised me to write an article\
  \ describing \u2018rural people\u2019s spontaneous participation in Maoist revolution\u2019\
  . I promised. He was talking to me the way, I guess, he talked to his credulous\
  \ comrades. The prosecution was over leaving rewards instead of a punishment for\
  \ us. We had a wonderful lunch with the meat of delicious mountain goat and a safe\
  \ journey to the hotel we had been kidnapped from. At midnight we sat on the balcony\
  \ in the gibbous. Grabbing Usha\u2019s hand, I stared at the half dark dizzy horizon\
  \ and saw a mysterious green-gold light reflecting from endless wide leaves of the\
  \ wild banana trees."
