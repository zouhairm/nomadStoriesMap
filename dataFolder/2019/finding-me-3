Text: "What brings you here \u2018 said the passport control officer \u2018\nI want\
  \ to see your beautiful country I replied.\nHe answered back but this week will\
  \ be a diesaster! \nI thought to myself \u201C I bet it\u2019s much calmer than\
  \ the disaster within\u201D\nMy birthday was coming soon and I\u2019m getting older.\
  \ It\u2019s not a pleasant time for me. Specially when I\u2019ve been facing disappointments\
  \ in the previous years. People pretending they don\u2019t know it\u2019s my birthday.\
  \ Some hiding or thinking of a dramatic story just to prevent greeting me or getting\
  \ a birthday present.\nWell, this year I\u2019ll treat myself and travel. I\u2019\
  ll celebrate with strangers and make new friends. I\u2019ll explore a country where\
  \ I\u2019ve never been before. \nI\u2019ll breathe the freedom and live the joy\
  \ of a small adventure with the best person ever \u201C ME\u201D.\nAfter the passing\
  \ the passport control I grabbed my luggage and met the tour guide of the trip she\
  \ was wAiting for me. We had a chat and indroduced ourselves finally we reached\
  \ our guest hosts home. It was absolutely beautiful. I found another girl waiting\
  \ so we had a short walk in the naghbourhood. The house was up the hill and there\
  \ was a beautiful scene with the blue skies and green mountains something I wouldn\u2019\
  t see back home. The dogs were following us as if they gaurding us and guiding us\
  \ back home. Later all the other girls came and we had a meal prepared by the mother.\
  \ The guest house was so warm and friendly. We left later for a short walk around\
  \ the city. Walking in the streets of Athens at Night. Girls exploring the city\
  \ for the first time. Dinning in the Greek traditional food. The couple of days\
  \ as the passport control officer said was a disaster and it was windy and rainy\
  \ with cold weather. We remained home and cooked some Greek recipes with girls and\
  \ guess what, we celebrated my birthday! It was a simple, small celebration with\
  \ some girls which I have just met. A night to remember. The day after the weAther\
  \ was getting better and we went on a road trip to see nipfilio where we walked\
  \ around and shopped, we saw the amazing sunset with the view of the port and mountains\
  \ it was breathtaking. Of course, as girls we continued shopping in the small town.\
  \ We were searching for souvenirs to take back home for our family and friends.\
  \ \nWell, what should we take? Delicious cheeses or some olive oil? Maybe just some\
  \ magnets and key rings with Greece\u2019s famous symbols. It\u2019s always good\
  \ to remember your loved ones with a small gift. Finally, going back home to me\
  \ was a struggle since it was bed time in my home country. I always felt sleepy\
  \ at the night time earlier than the other girls. But it was a short trip no time\
  \ to waste sleeping. The last day I decided to explore the city alone. I went took\
  \ the public transport and the bus dropped me in the city center. \nIn the bus a\
  \ guy warned me and said take care of your bag there are a lot of thieves in this\
  \ area. I wasn\u2019t really comfortable walking around with my money.so I booked\
  \ a hotel where I felt it was a good place to stay for one night. I left my things\
  \ in the hotel room and googled the best dining place in the area. At first I walked\
  \ but afterwards I felt I was tired and took a taxi. He dropped me at a restaurant\
  \ with a rooftop sitting area. The views were lovely and it was a romantic place\
  \ with the candle light and sunset. I went to a cafe where I had my coffee a carrot\
  \ cake for desert after the walk in town I headed towards the hotel and prepared\
  \ myself to travel in the morning. A week in Athens, walking in the city, eating\
  \ from traditional restaurants and exploring their culture, breathing fresh air.\
  \ \nThe sense of freedom and feeling of joy. Finding something new, learning about\
  \ YOU.\nThe journey of discovery is within. Travel to find yourself."
