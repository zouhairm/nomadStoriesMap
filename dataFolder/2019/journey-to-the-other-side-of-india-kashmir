Text: "When I say traveling to India, most people often think about the landmark of\
  \ the city, such as Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Mumbai and others. There is another side\
  \ of India that is not known by many people, the heaven on earth, the state Jammu\
  \ and Kashmir. Kashmir, surrounded by beautiful Himalaya mountain, kahwa tea, scenic\
  \ panorama view, etc. When you step out of the plane in Srinagar airport, you can\
  \ see the beautiful place surrounded by mountains. When you are in the plane, sitting\
  \ near the window seat might be a great idea because you are flying above the mountain\
  \ and you can see the mountain closer. \n\nThere are 4 main beautiful places in\
  \ Kashmir, namely Srinagar, Sonamarg, Gulmarg and Pahalgam. All these places are\
  \ accessible by car. I visited Kashmir during winter and the best place to visit\
  \ is Gulmarg. Sonamarg and Pahalgam are beautiful, but those places are best to\
  \ visit in Summer because many roads are blocked in winter. \n\nSrinagar\nSrinagar\
  \ is the capital city in Kashmir. I visited two gardens in Srinagar, Heritage Mughal\
  \ Garden and Shalimar Garden. In winter time, the gardens turn to a white covered\
  \ garden, but still beautiful. In Shalimar Garden, there were people offered the\
  \ Kashmir traditional Mughal dress and photography. It costs Rs 200 per person include\
  \ 1 photography. Interesting, I am in!\nIn Srinagar, the unmissable thing to do\
  \ is overnight in the houseboat and shikara ride. Staying in the houseboat is a\
  \ great experience. The sun set earlier in winter time and most shops are closed\
  \ at 5 PM. I thought it would be bored and I could slept earlier in Srinagar, but\
  \ no way. The night still going on. There will be people nonstop coming to the houseboat\
  \ and selling some local handicraft and cute souvenirs. \n\nSonamarg\nI had a day\
  \ trip to Sonamarg from Srinagar.  Planned to visit the Tjawas Glacier but the road\
  \ was blocked. So I took a horse ride to the four points in Sonamarg. Among the\
  \ way to the four points, there were some winter activities such as ice sledge,\
  \ short ski and others. I didn\u2019t find those interesting because I planned to\
  \ do those activites in Gulmarg. So I only took the ice sledge and sightseeing.\n\
  \nGulmarg\nGulmarg is not just a beautiful place, but even the route to Gulmarg\
  \ makes your eyes open. You will passed through beautiful pine trees among the Himalaya\
  \ mountain. Gulmarg is one of the top ski destination in the world. In winter time,\
  \ many people from all over the world visit Gulmarg for ski. The gondola ride is\
  \ one of the highest in the world with around 12,000 ft above sea level (first phase).\
  \ Second phase of gondola is not accessible in winter. Many professional skiers\
  \ will take the gondola ride up to ski down. \nBesides ski, there are many other\
  \ winter activites in Gulmarg. My favorite is snow cycle because it is easier to\
  \ ride and I was having so much fun. I was so amazed of the view around me. I never\
  \ seen something like this. Look around, the beautiful pine trees and white clean\
  \ snow. It caught my heart and turned to be one of my happiest day in my traveling\
  \ memories.\n\nPahalgam\nI believe Pahalgam is a beautiful summer destination. I\
  \ skipped Pahalgam because I extended my stay in Gulmarg. I was lucky to made that\
  \ decision, because there were terrorist bomb attack on the way to Pahalgam in the\
  \ same day, and four people died :( \n\nIn overall, I found Kashmir a beautiful\
  \ place with sad story. A place that is longing for freedom and independence. I\
  \ was there when there were 42 Indian armies died in a terrorist bomb attack. Kashmir\
  \ is a majority Muslim country, with many politic conflicts. Based on my conversations\
  \ with the local people there, they do not want to be part of India because of the\
  \ historical nature land, Kashmir was not part of India neither Pakistan."
