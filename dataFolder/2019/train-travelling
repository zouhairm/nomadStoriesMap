Text: 'This is just a little story of a short, but endless journey and just like a
  quiet wanderer. Even like a poem written with hundreds of rhythms sounding the sound
  of a train engine running on the railroad tracks that have been built since 1922
  creeping along the South of Thailand which is bordered by Malaysia. Mainland-connected
  Two Countries connect railroad tracks with human cells that live above the carriage
  cars that take them to flee for a moment from real life and move to short dreams
  as short as they fall asleep in short sleeps.


  In the Thai Railway, which is usually called the International Express or Special
  Express Train Number 35, This Daewoo Korea-made train runs not as tight as the MRT
  in Singapore or in Bangkok, this train is often called the Slow Train / Sleeper
  Train but also not like a pedicab or dolman run in my village. But every second
  felt my soul running from one coordinate point to another, from one second to another.
  If the memory in this head could be as fast as that shift, maybe I''m very happy.
  And this is what feels when our visual memory is slower than Time That is why I
  really love the Train Travelling.'
