Text: "Somewhere along our +-5000 kilometre roadtrip to uncover the slab of land we\
  \ call home, my travelling companion and I find a quote which reads \u2018Travel\
  \ is the only thing you buy which makes you richer.\u2019 We take a fancy to the\
  \ phrase and scribble it down. Yet, as the national road leads us through the Sunshine\
  \ Coast and into the Wild Coast (or the Transkei), I begin to wonder if the phrase\
  \ isn\u2019t a little trite.\n \nThe Transkei is the northern, coastal region of\
  \ the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Under South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime, it\
  \ was one of the \u2018independent\u2019 black states the government created to\
  \ keep black people and white people separate; and the name from that period, \u2018\
  Transkei\u2019, has stuck around. Despite now being 100% part of the South African\
  \ state, the area still carries the marks of segregation and economic neglect. It\
  \ is predominantly a rural region, where much of the population are living in challenging\
  \ conditions. Yet, it is also a tourist-magnet, so alongside small houses and huts\
  \ are hotels, eco-friendly lodges, and backpackers for white kids on surfing holidays\
  \ (present writer included).\n\nA week in the Transkei is as long as it takes to\
  \ reveal the deep contradictions of travelling through such a place. From Port St\
  \ Johns, to Coffee Bay, to Bulungula, we are struck by the jaw-dropping scenery\
  \ of the Transkei. It is a vast expanse of hill-lands. Not dramatic, jagged hills\
  \ like the Drakensberg, but lush sweeps and folds of hills that continue beyond\
  \ what the eye can see. Occasionally, a river parts the folds of the land, and everywhere\
  \ people\u2019s huts are dotted, painted in bright turquoise or peach. You cannot\
  \ notice, however, the visual opulence of the scenery without also becoming aware\
  \ of how many people exist in such a landscape with few material possessions and\
  \ minimal physical infrastructure. By the time we reach Bulungula, I am beginning\
  \ to experience a disquieting kind of voyeurism, and the catchy little phrase I\
  \ liked is feeling stale in my mouth. Sure, this road trip is making me \u2018richer',\
  \ but it is also highlighting that I was rich enough to begin with to take this\
  \ trip \u2014 a privilege more people don\u2019t have than do in South Africa.\n\
  \ \nOf the three places we stayed in the Transkei, Bulungula is the place where\
  \ this sense of voyeurism eases somewhat. Unlike the backpackers we use in Port\
  \ St Johns and Coffee Bay (Amapondo Backpackers Lodge and Coffee Shack, both offering\
  \ quality accommodation), Bulungula Lodge is not privately owned \u2014 it is owned\
  \ collectively by the rural Xhosa community in which it is situated. This means\
  \ that the lodge facilities (like the common room) are utilised by locals as well\
  \ as tourists, and every activity on offer (like canoeing or pancakes on the beach)\
  \ is the initiative of a member of the community. I wouldn\u2019t suggest boycotting\
  \ privately owned backpackers in the Transkei (because that is mostly all there\
  \ is, and they still contribute to employment in the area), but I would suggest\
  \ putting Bulungula at the top of your must-see list. It is a space where a genuine\
  \ connection with the people of the area is possible; that made me feel like I had\
  \ their permission to be sharing their beautiful home, rather than passing through\
  \ it with no beneficial impact.\n\nIn truth, we noticed poverty in every place we\
  \ visited on our roadtrip: inland Eastern Cape, the Free State, St Lucia. It was\
  \ only in the Transkei where it really got under my skin, unignorable and itchy.\
  \ Travel is an unbelievable privilege, and it does make you \u2018richer\u2019,\
  \ as our cute quote claims. Yet, it can also be contradictory and uncomfortable.\
  \ When travel makes me feel this way, as it did in the Transkei, I refuse to see\
  \ it as a reflection of the place. Instead, it is a reflection of the ways in which\
  \ I am rich, and the unfairness that other people aren\u2019t. It\u2019s a feeling\
  \ that needs to drive towards some sort of action \u2014 at the least towards more\
  \ ethical travel\u2026 and perhaps towards action when you return home, so that\
  \ other people can learn about the richness of travel too."
