Text: "There are countries to which people are completely indifferent and don\u2019\
  t expect to see something special in a country that they hardly heard about. It\
  \ happened to me when my parents suggested spending our summer holidays in Albania.\
  \ Searching the internet, I found some interesting places, but I was still skeptical\
  \ about this trip.\nWe spent three days on the road, traveling by car from Ukraine,\
  \ we crossed 5 borders. And here we went on a road that was more like a ribbon that\
  \ casually felt on the mountains because it wags in all directions. Outside there\
  \ were colorful shepherds, who were leading their sheep from pasture. And somewhere\
  \ in the distance we saw the sunset, which we hopelessly tried to catch up at a\
  \ speed of 40 kilometers per hour. A few more turns and the coast opened before\
  \ us. We entered the city of Saranda.\nFirst impression: the usual resort city with\
  \ families and children who unwillingly dragged their bright swimming mattresses\
  \ to their hotels. As well as the general panorama, our hotel looked trite, but\
  \ my eyes caught an almost imperceptible detail near the entrance door: a teddy\
  \ bear embellished with blood and without one paw. In this way locals scare away\
  \ evil spirits, and they observe this tradition even in hotels, hospitably protecting\
  \ their guests.\nThat evening we got out to have dinner at the most expensive restaurant\
  \ in the whole country (by the way, the prices here are equal to the ordinary tourist\
  \ cafe in Europe). It was a restaurant on the fortress of Lekursi. We were fascinated\
  \ by breathtaking views, a purple sunset and the place itself where every centimeter\
  \ breathes antiquity.\nAlbania is like a pretty girl whose fans-neighboring countries\
  \ have gifted her in every possible way. The menu of national cuisine, she apparently\
  \ made with help of Italy. Albania borrowed her love of the sea and relaxation from\
  \ Greece. And the hospitality to the Albanians came through the Balkan Mountains\
  \ from Bulgaria and Serbia.\nOf course, we could spend the whole week lying on the\
  \ beach under the sun and enjoying the waves of the Ionian Sea. But the next morning\
  \ we got into the car again and went to look at the truly amazing miracle of nature\
  \ \u2013 the natural water source Syri i Kalt\xEBr. \nWhat I saw exceeded all my\
  \ expectations: it would seem like a small and cold lake, with springs beating beneath\
  \ it, but ... I climbed up the stairs to look at the spring from above and caught\
  \ sight of the whole country, still so clean, not corrupted by tourists, I saw the\
  \ look of freedom-loving Albanians, I looked into the eyes of nature itself ...\
  \ \nThe pupil of the \u201Ceye\u201D was dark blue and everyone who looked there\
  \ was attracted by the abyss of water. The bravest jumped right into the center\
  \ of the source, but they immediately pushed by water to the surface and carried\
  \ along the river... A fence with a \u201Cjump is prohibited\u201D sign, a couple\
  \ of minutes of doubt, a deep breath and ... cold water, which carried me away.\
  \ I grabbed the branch and stand up. Emotions, thoughts? I don\u2019t remember anything:\
  \ only me and the lake. \nObeying a thirst for adventure, we went north a few days\
  \ later. We were driving in a time machine. Having left the comfortable Saranda,\
  \ we arrived at the ancient Girokastra. A city with a history of 3 millennia. The\
  \ winding streets, good-natured local and houses-towers. Another sunset on top of\
  \ the old fortress, from which today remained only the foundation. Once the freedom-loving\
  \ ancestors of the Albanians went there, and today the same magnificent eagles fly\
  \ over the castle.\nA country in which there is nothing to look for? No, Albania\
  \ is a country in which I didn\u2019t expect to find: to find sights, to find views,\
  \ to find impressions, to find myself and get lost only a couple of times when the\
  \ navigator suddenly stopped to work. Such a mysterious and unbanal country, in\
  \ which you want to go back and look for more..."
