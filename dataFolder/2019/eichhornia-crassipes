  \ joy, \u201CAnd runs off LPG.\u201D He gestures back to the engine.\n\n\u201CLPG?\u201D\
  \ I ask, peering around him to the back of the barge.\n\n\u201CYes! Better for river.\
  \ Less pollution than petrol,\u201D he waves his arm again, this time towards the\
  \ water where a scum of oil floats in greasy rainbows, punctuated by the odd bit\
  \ of floating \u2018disposable\u2019 plastic and some green weed. Ah. Liquid petroleum\
  \ gas. \n\nWe are stood on a grimy riverbank in Alleppey, about to embark on an\
  \ overnight tour of the Keralan Backwaters - a maze of canals, rivers and lakes\
  \ which snake through the region\u2019s countryside. To one side, a swathe of green\
  \ covers the waterway, dotted with lilac flowers and white herons. The other direction?\
  \ Floating plastic, debris, brown water. I look down. Murk clouds around. There\u2019\
  s no sign of any fish.\n\n\u201CIs this special?\u201D I prompt Saji, \u201CThe\
  \ panels?\u201D\n\n\u201COnly one like this!\u201D he declares, pointing to the\
  \ other, less eco-conscious vessels. \u201CBut for A-C we need plug in.\u201D\n\n\
  It lifts my heart to hear his voice rise in pride. To know that someone cares, that\
  \ someone wants to make a difference. Throughout India we have seen so much pollution\
  \ - litter taking over roadsides and beaches, a sun that sets inches above the horizon\
  \ because the city pollution is so thick. This country contains the most polluted\
  \ cities in the world, shortening the lives of hundreds and thousands of citizens.\
  \ But here, in a corner of the south, things are changing. As we motor out, I look\
  \ behind at the green carpet. Wishing the rest of the country could look so picturesque.\
  \ \n\nMy wish is short lived. The barge soon comes to a halt, the tillerman shouting.\
  \ We drift for a moment as he fishes over the bow, pushing something out of the\
  \ way. I peer forwards. I can\u2019t see what it is past a clump of the same floaty\
  \ greenery from before. But then it comes away. And I can see that it\u2019s the\
  \ plant that\u2019s the problem. \n\nFrom then on, I notice it everywhere. It writhes\
  \ into carcasses of former boats, swills past in great floating tumours and forms\
  \ a natural fence for anything trying to move along. In the open water, it is worse.\
  \ We\u2019re joined by a variety of other barges, many towering like wicker hotels\
  \ above our simple two-bed craft. But we also float past rafts of the weed covering\
  \ the same area. A solitary plant floats past within my reach. I grab it.\n\n\u201C\
  African plant,\u201D the tillerman tells me, seeing my interest \u201CIn Malayalam,\
  \ we call it\u2026\u201D he says a word, which to me sounds like \u201CPayel\u201D\
  .\n\nA quick google tells me it is Water Hyacinth. Eichhornia crassipes. I scan\
  \ further down the article. \u201CInvasive species\u201D jumps out at me. I read\
  \ on, stomach turning. Suddenly all the other pollutants are put into sharp perspective.\
  \ Yes, plastic is bad, horrendous for the planet, as are the streaks of petrol,\
  \ but it is nothing on this murderous flora. \n\nWe travel further inland, past\
  \ whole canals which are close to cut off as the weed takes hold. A small problem\
  \ for tourists, like myself. They can always take another route. But for many this\
  \ is their road. This is how they access schools, hospitals, jobs. A steadily growing\
  \ barrier fights against them. But this is not the only issue. Far from breathing\
  \ green life into the canals, as I\u2019d thought, the plant is suffocating everything\
  \ else around it. It starves the rivers of oxygen, meaning no fish can survive;\
  \ no other flora has space. It only supports two species: mosquitos and freshwater\
  \ snails. Carriers of malaria and schistosomiasis.\n\nI wish I could take a net\
  \ and collect it all in. Try and breathe life back in to the backwaters. But it\
  \ would never work. Like so many of the environmental problems here in India, finding\
  \ the problem is easy, the solution is much harder."
