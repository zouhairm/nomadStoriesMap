Text: "In the middle of our annual Passover celebration, Oma vanished from the table.\
  \ When she returned, she had a book in her hand. I recognized the cover instantly\
  \ \u2013 it was the only forbidden book on the towering bookcase in her living room.\
  \ It had sat on the highest shelf for decades, out of reach of the ever-growing,\
  \ grimy hands of her grandchildren. Now it sat on the table in front of the entire\
  \ family. The room fell silent.\n\n\u201CBerliner Grundschulatlas,\u201D my 89-year-old\
  \ grandmother read the title out loud. Her words hung in the air. It was the first\
  \ time I\u2019d ever heard her speak in her native tongue. She went on to explain\
  \ that this old school atlas was the only thing she\u2019d taken with her when she\
  \ fled Nazi-era Berlin with her parents in the late 1930s. \u201CIt\u2019s time\
  \ I show you my Heimat \u2013 my home,\u201D she told us.\n\nOur family huddled\
  \ around on all sides as she carefully turned the frail, yellowing pages. Finally,\
  \ she found what she was looking for: a rainbow-coloured children\u2019s sketch\
  \ of a house and its surrounding neighbourhood. Building by building, street by\
  \ street, my grandmother had \u2013 nearly seventy years ago \u2013 documented her\
  \ childhood home in Berlin with a set of pencil crayons.\n\nFor the next two hours,\
  \ she continually referenced the map while describing her childhood in Berlin to\
  \ us: her seventh birthday party in the park, the building where her best friend\
  \ had lived, and even where her favourite ice cream shop in the neighbourhood had\
  \ been. \u201COf course,\u201D she abruptly reminded us. \u201CThis was before we\
  \ \u2013 the Jews \u2013 were banned from all of these places.\u201D\n\nShe recalled\
  \ each place in impeccable detail, as if she had left Berlin only yesterday. Showing\
  \ us a worn photo of what appeared to be an ordinary apartment building, she recounted\
  \ her family\u2019s belongings, room by room, of the third-floor apartment she\u2019\
  d grown up in. Tears welled in her eyes. Even after decades in Canada, she visibly\
  \ ached for all that she had lost when the Nazis had forced her family to leave\
  \ Berlin. Squiggly pencil lines and a faded photograph were all she had left of\
  \ the place she had once called home.\n\nOma died a few weeks after Passover that\
  \ year and, in the days after her funeral, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking of the\
  \ places she\u2019d told us about that night. \n\nThree months later, I found myself\
  \ standing in front of a custard yellow apartment building on a residential street\
  \ in Berlin\u2019s Spandau district. Four floors tall, the facade of the building\
  \ was crisp and clean. Curtains adorned the windows of the third-floor apartment\
  \ where Oma had once lived. Neglected flowerbeds lined the walkway leading to the\
  \ front door. \n\nI rang the doorbell of Oma\u2019s old apartment hoping that doing\
  \ so might afford me the opportunity to learn more about her former life. When there\
  \ was no answer, I had no choice but to continue on my way.  I pulled out the handmade\
  \ map once more, using it as my guide to navigate the unfamiliar city streets.\n\
  \nMinutes later, I turned a corner and saw a blinking, bright orange sign that read:\
  \ Florida Eiscaf\xE9. It was exactly where the map said it would be. A lineup of\
  \ eager customers poured out onto the sidewalk. Children with chocolate moustaches\
  \ and sticky, ice-cream covered fingers played on the sidewalk nearby. I saw a sign\
  \ hanging in the window, declaring that the family-run shop had first opened in\
  \ 1923. \n\nThis was my Oma\u2019s favourite ice cream shop. \n\nIt was then that\
  \ I realized that maybe love isn\u2019t only about the people in your life, but\
  \ that it\u2019s also about the places where we feel most at home. These places\
  \ \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 fill us up with light and energy at moments when\
  \ we feel particularly vulnerable or lost. Decades ago, Oma had preserved her places\
  \ of refuge with her pencil crayons, drawing the sites dearest to her young heart\
  \ in a moment of her life when she yearned for her former home the most. I finally\
  \ understood that although she'd lived in Canada for decades, her heart would always\
  \ belong in Berlin and its everyday places."
