Text: "I went to Thailand looking for exhilarating adventures.\nI found them, yes,\
  \  but also I found something a little bit more than just that.\n\nMy hotel host\
  \ gave me a map of the small town of Chiang Dao. \nLooking at it I decided to go\
  \ to Wat Tham Pha Plong Temple.\n\nThinking I could reach it at a bike ride distance\
  \ I rented an old bicycle that looked pretty rusty but I thought it would do the\
  \ trick. \n\nI started my journey in a narrowed street that went up the mountain.\n\
  I could not gain much speed.  Most of time I had to stand up on the pedals to be\
  \ able to keep on pedalling as the bike became very hard under my feet. \n\nSweat\
  \ drooled out of my me. My back was completely wet. The fabric of my clothes clenched\
  \  to my body and my legs became very tired.\n\nAfter some time I arrived at my\
  \ destination. Thankful to leave the bike behind, I locked it on a bench and went\
  \ inside the court yard of the temple.\n\nOn the contrary of all the other Temples\
  \ I had visited in northern Thailand, this one had a 500 naga stairway going deep\
  \ into the jungle. \nI had to either climb it to continue towards the Temple or\
  \ go back. \nMy legs ached and the stairs didn\u2019t look very friendly but in\
  \ the end I decided to climb the stairs.\n\nJust as the muscles of my legs began\
  \ to give in I saw a sign that was written in Thai and then its translation into\
  \ english: \u201CDo not grumble when you suffer. Just Persevere\u201D \nI\u2019\
  m pretty sure it meant another kind of \u201Csuffering\u201D but at that moment\
  \ I felt like someone was telling me to persevere on my walk.  And so I did. \n\n\
  I am so glad I did.\n\nAs I kept on walking up I kept  finding these signs every\
  \ couple of steps. I figured they where buddhist teachings and phrases to muse on.\
  \ What a better place than out there, in the wild, in the mountain, in contact with\
  \ nature, with natural sounds, with the heat, with my tired body. With my self.\n\
  \nThere were  signs that made me cry. \nOthers made me see my mistakes or gave me\
  \ hope.\nAnd some others made me understand why I was truly  there.  It wasn\u2019\
  t just coincidence. \n\nSuddenly, without warning, in the distance, from between\
  \ the trees I saw the Temple with its Golden Stupa. Behind it the mountain still\
  \ raised many meters up. The top was outlined with a grey cloudy sky. There was\
  \ something hypnotising about the whole place. No matter how tired I felt I could\
  \ not stop going up.\n\nWhen at the Temple, the cave dedicated for prayer was indeed\
  \ beautiful but the impressive sight for me was out in the open next to the cave.\
  \  Two giant Nagas opened fiercely their mouths at me leading up the final stairs\
  \ to the Golden Stupa.  From their magnificent heads to the end of their bodies\
  \ tiny mirrors of green, red and blue shown with the sun light.\n\nReaching the\
  \ top, standing in the corridor with its concrete white banisters that surrounded\
  \ the Stupa the view blew me away.\n\nThe endless majesty of the green jungle erupted\
  \ power, energy and beauty. \n\nA soft wind blew every now and then moving the branches\
  \ of the trees making me feel like I was being cleaned while on the cave below a\
  \ group of monks and some children where chanting prayers in unison melting pure\
  \ sounds into my whole body.\n\nI let go of everything unwanted in my life and I\
  \ welcomed a new beginning with a clean and pure heart. \n\nAn immense tranquility\
  \ hugged me. Insects flew around me and I let them dance merrily. It was like someone\
  \ had open a door that allowed me to blend in with nature.\n\nWhen I realised I\
  \ had been sitting there for almost 2 hours. I didn\u2019t want to move. \n\nThe\
  \ most unexpected personal adventure came to me without any sort of planning and\
  \ more than just having a thrilling time I found freedom. Something I didn\u2019\
  t know I was desperately looking for."
