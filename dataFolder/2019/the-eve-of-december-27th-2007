Text: "My family and I were in Pakistan, for a two week vacation, we were there to\
  \ visit family and also to attend a wedding.  Most of the trip went smoothly but\
  \ just the day before we were to return home, things took a turn for the worse.\
  \ It seemed an impossibility that we would be able to reach back home, on the eve\
  \ of December 27, 2007, from Karachi, Pakistan to London, Ontario, Canada.\n\nAs\
  \ is customary in Pakistan after the actual wedding event, relatives and friends\
  \ throw dinner parties in honor of the couple and their families. Once the festivities\
  \ of the wedding were over we had a dinner nearly every night to go to. On December\
  \ 27 just a two days before we were to return back home, we had a dinner to attend\
  \ as usual, we were going to a restaurant. \n\nThe day began with the usual hustle\
  \ bustle of a metropolitan city. The weather was neither cold nor hot. In Karachi,\
  \ the temperature stays much the same throughout the year. We had some time to kill\
  \ as events tend to start quite late at night around 10 pm. The Bazaars also stay\
  \ open till late.  My husband and his sister decided to go for some shopping. I\
  \ decided to stay at home as my daughter was one year old and the bazaars are not\
  \ very stroller friendly in Karachi, so I decided to stay behind.\n\nJust around\
  \ 6.30pm news started breaking that Benazir Bhutto has been assassinated. She had\
  \ been killed by gunshot followed by bomb blast. She was rallying in Rawalpindi,\
  \ Pakistan, ahead of the elections that were supposed to take place in 2008. She\
  \ was the leader of the opposition called Pakistan People\u2019s Party, at the time.\
  \ She had been Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister twice already. She was loved by a\
  \ lot of people. Her death not only put Pakistan into turmoil politically but it\
  \ was chaos on the roads too. \n\nAll this happened while my husband and his sister\
  \ were still out. As the news broke of the assassination the shops started to close\
  \ down and people started running back to their homes. While some people were able\
  \ to run home, others stayed behind in their offices or shops to avoid the violence.\n\
  All this created chaos, there were massive traffic jams on the road. Some people\
  \ took advantage of this and started burning tires and breaking windshields of vehicles.\
  \ The same thing happened in front of the car that my husband was in, I prayed for\
  \ the safety of my husband and his sister. My husband was in contact through cell\
  \ phone from time to time to keep us updated.  I was not even sure they will be\
  \ coming back home alive or not. Eventually around 9 pm they both got home, the\
  \ dinner got cancelled and we stayed home. \n\nThe night passed, Karachi had curfew\
  \ imposed on the roads to avoid any more chaos. The next day passed without any\
  \ further mishaps, even though the supporters of Benazir were ready to do anything.\
  \  Much of the city stayed home. Our flight was the early in the morning the next\
  \ day so we had to get to the airport at 3 am that night. We started our journey\
  \ back home not knowing if we will be able to make it. It was quite late at night\
  \ there was no one on the roads, just a lone tire burning in the middle of the road.\
  \ \n\nWe reached the airport, checked in and waited for our flight. Once we were\
  \ air borne, we thanked God.  We reached home safely. There was further turmoil\
  \ but none that the Pakistanis could not handle.  This taught me a lesson, you never\
  \ know what will happen next and that death can come any second.  The lady gone\
  \ had so much power and so much to look forward to, but now there was nothing left\
  \ of her except her legacy in her children. Also to be brave in the face of whatever\
  \ the life throws at you."
