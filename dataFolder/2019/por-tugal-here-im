Text: "My optimistic and nomad spirit and eager to embark on new directions, this\
  \ time embark me on the dream of traveling to new latitudes, sharing experiences,\
  \ sharing smiles with strangers of languages \u200B\u200Bdifferent from mine, but\
  \ united by the same adventurous heart always eager to know more and more.\n\nTraveling\
  \ is one of the best and most pleasant experiences that life gives me and allows\
  \ me to feel other cultures, stay impregnated with the smell of the indigenous flavors\
  \ and textures that only our fertile and varied planet can offer us from north to\
  \ south, east to west, as a treasure ready to be discovered and that only those\
  \ of us who want to achieve it will see this dream embodied in a fantastic reality,\
  \ because we are all inhabitants of the same planet and we are united by the love\
  \ of the universe and the desire to exchange ties that go beyond the borders in\
  \ a journey that embraces the infinite and fills the deepest part of our soul because\
  \ it is a journey from our interior to the place where destiny will augur us the\
  \ best opportunities and surprises and this will be one of them. I'm sure and it\
  \ will be. \n\nPortugal how much I hope to meet you, you will be my inspiration\
  \ to capture what my curious eyes to travel new destinations admire and manage to\
  \ transmit through a blog to add with vibrant energies the miles that I intend to\
  \ accumulate in this new experience in my life as a lover of travel around this\
  \ fantastic place that we call home."
