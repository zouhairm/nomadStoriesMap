Text: "Hello! My name is Neagu Catalin Constantin and I am going to tell you a story\
  \ about how a crazy idea sprouted into reality. \n\n   It all started back in the\
  \ summer of 2014 when I could game relentlessly hours on end, thus joining a crazy\
  \ community called a \"guild\". So I was playing this video game and here I met\
  \ someone special, a friend. We used to spend days playing together and grinding\
  \ our characters up to max level and trying to get the greatest gear in game. I\
  \ know, it does sound like a typical teenager's life, going back and forth from\
  \ realities. One that happened online, and one in real life.Joining such a large\
  \ community gives you the opportunity to meet people from all over the globe and\
  \ bond together over your love for the same video game. My friend and I are not\
  \ a special case, we are just regular people who share the same passion for gaming.\
  \ \n   Fast forward to October of 2018, when we had a crazy idea. What if we actually\
  \ met in person? That doesn't sound too far fetched and impossible to achieve, except\
  \ we both live in different countries, although both in Europe. . So I searched\
  \ the internet, scanning for low-cost flights to her country. I must specify that\
  \ she lives in The Netherlands and I live in Romania. One week later, I found one\
  \ flight that was affordable.\n   It is December the 24 and I boarded my flight\
  \ and immediately fell asleep, because I couldn't sleep the night before. When I\
  \ woke up I was already in a new country, confused and surrounded by a language\
  \ I didn't recognize. To my surprise, we both didn't have any anxiety to meet one\
  \ another and our online synergy transposed into real life. I felt calm and ready\
  \ to embark on my two weeks journey. I landed in Eindhoven and there we stayed at\
  \ her father's house for two days. Her family was surprisingly welcoming and they\
  \ were not reluctant to invite an absolute stranger into their house. I experienced\
  \ my first dutch Christmas, which wasn't very different than any other country,\
  \ except they give each other really expensive gifts. Mostly perfume or cash. My\
  \ stay at her father's house came to an end and we took the train to meet her mom\
  \ in Tilburg. I must admit, she is one of the funniest mom I have ever met. She\
  \ invited us for dinner to celebrate Christmas with her too and there I met the\
  \ rest of my friend's family.\n   From Tilburg we went to Bergen op Zoom where her\
  \ apartment was. Her apartment was huge.I felt quite luxurious, despite being on\
  \ a low-cost travel. Bergen op Zoom is quite a small city so I had enough time to\
  \ discover its unique architecture and hidden treasures. \n  But my journey did\
  \ not end in Bergem op Zoom. We went back to Tilburg to celebrate New Years with\
  \ her brother and a couple of friends. After New Years we took a break for a few\
  \ days to recover and then back on the train and to Amsterdam to meet another friend\
  \ we knew online. Amsterdam was remarkably beautiful, but awfully expensive. But\
  \ we didn't have to worry about food, because our friend cooked for us some traditional\
  \ recipe he knew. Our next destination was Rotterdam and in contrast with Amsterdam,\
  \ it was much more modern with skyscrapers  instead of medieval looking buildings.\
  \  I started this journey not expecting much and quite scared and I ended up finding\
  \ two warm incredible people that are willing to allow a stranger into their house\
  \ and make it feel a home. Because all good things must come to an end, it was time\
  \ to go back to my country. The travel back home was the most stressful, because\
  \ the flight was too early on and I had to take three trains back to Eindhoven.\
  \ I thought I wouldn't make it, but fortunately I did. \n  This will probably remain\
  \ my craziest experience ever for years to come and I am certainly going to go back\
  \ to this amazing country for more fun."
