Text: "Like all family heirlooms, a small apartment in the Balearic island of Menorca\
  \ has been passed hand-to-hand, year-to-year, between the adults in my life to form\
  \ a generation of associated memories, as much a part of our unified childhood experiences\
  \ as our brown eyes and need of braces. \n\nJust twenty minutes from the iconic\
  \ Arenal beach lies the familial treasure: a cheerful three-room receptacle of light\
  \ and the occasional Lilford Lizard. The Villa protrudes from the hill that winds\
  \ irreverently from Menorca\u2019s stout northern cliffs, through the backwoods\
  \ of Aleppo pines, towards the tourist haven of central Port d\u2019Addaia. \n\n\
  Last year I believed, while visiting d\u2019Addaia again, that the comfortable minutia\
  \ of a stay by the port was as engraved into me as the print of a well thumbed novel,\
  \ worn and loved. \n\nBut I was to be surprised. \n\nAn unexpected discovery came\
  \ to us at Cantina Port; the annual sight at the end of a careful trod -- thanks\
  \ to a sheer and breezy drop to rock pools below -- down the bush path from the\
  \ Villas to the ocean. \nCantina port is part of Menorca\u2019s horizon but also\
  \ relatively unknown, often overlooked in the shadow of its larger, more bustling,\
  \ coastal adjacent -- the boating town Es Castell. \nBut there, at the bottom of\
  \ the d'Addaia hill, lies a smattering of boats that bob harmoniously in the shallows\
  \ of the Mediterranean sea. As dusk inhabits the Island, all evening long there\
  \ will appear from these boats the regulars of La Cantina bar and restaurant; they\
  \ are drawn to shore by the summer-time smells of Saffron \u2014 broiling in generous\
  \ pans of Paella \u2014 and lemon \u2014 sliced and lulled on the surface of goblets\
  \ of Menorcan gin. \n\nLike returning nomads we greeted the chefs who had known\
  \ me since nappies, and ordered plates of Menorcan-goats cheese pizza that came\
  \ bigger than the tables that the Cantina crew had decked out at the foot of the\
  \ pier. \n\nLooking out at a mass of land that sat just metres from the restaurant,\
  \ my Dad made a usual remark about dumping us kids there, just abreast of the shore,\
  \ when we got too loud or rough with each other in the hot hours of the mornings.\
  \ \n\nBut this year, Juan \u2014 a teeny, weathered waiter who drunk with my parents\
  \ on his days off \u2014 heard him. \n\n\u201CYou can hide anything there, James.\
  \ Like the smugglers, that\u2019s all they did,\u201D Juan replied, gesturing to\
  \ the seemingly harmless off-shore Isle with a gaze of such macabre mischief that\
  \ we immediately leant forward and demanded he explain. \n\nJuan told of us pirates;\
  \ of caves, like that just off d\u2019Addaia, filled with blood-money and loot,\
  \ crammed with gold reaped from crime. He told us of political squabbling over the\
  \ barren-lands of Menorca by Catalan, British and Roman hands for a chance to recover\
  \ the hoards of wealth, of danger and daring \u2014 and he told us not to wait to\
  \ discover it any longer, but to get into the sea and go. \n\nThanks to Juan, later\
  \ that very week, I bowed my head under an outcropping of rock, let go of an oar,\
  \ and grazed the surface of a Pirates Cove with the back of my hand. We were still,\
  \ miraculously, in a patch of ocean in sight of the Villa we had so long misunderstood\
  \ as a sanctuary of the most sleepy and benign place in the world. \nAnd yet, we\
  \ found ourselves sent rocking in rented canoes, as the cove\u2019s shadows swallowed\
  \ up the hot-beat of the sun and bore echoes of the dark past overhead. \nWe were,\
  \ all of us, drifted into territory with depths of terror and risk as deep as the\
  \ sea below \u2014 and a desire to understand Menorca more was satiated. \n\nThe\
  \ Isle, up close at last, was the last unknown of our childhood haven: the hidden\
  \ crookery of Cantina.\n\nAs d\u2019Addaia and its port receded, farther but ever\
  \ in reach, over the waves, the dreamy spectre of Menorca as idyll only was thankfully\
  \ submerged in my head. What emerged up anew was an image of a real, living, breathing\
  \ place \u2014 one with as much possibility and adventure in its present as there\
  \ was in its history."
