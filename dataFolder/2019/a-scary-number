Text: "The delicate moon of an Algerian winter shone through the high windows of my\
  \ house, already midnight, I began to imagine having  the chance to go to a beautiful\
  \ country, it is Greece, how much I loved this country!\nWhen i arrived there, I\
  \ considered that this was the true beginning of my life ,after so much thinking,\
  \ I chose a nice place to visit it was \"the old castle\" that is called \"frangokastello\"\
  \ I was so amazed that I could not even describe it, it was the best castle I've\
  \ seen in all my life, it is very beautiful and very old from the outside, Having\
  \ made my first step in this place, I received a weird message by a number unknown,\
  \ \"attention !! Do not enter\xBB\nI continued to explore the rooms of this old\
  \ castle with curiosity, I was excited, there were two things that attracted me\
  \ and scared me.\nThe first thing was the people who walk slowly like mummies, by\
  \ the way, they did not look like normal people, and the second thing was the frames\
  \  of characters who seem angry, it's wasn't very clear to understand.\nsuddenly,\
  \ the lights went out, where I had a great trauma, my feet shivered with shock\n\
  It was incredible to believe it because I saw these fabulous stories just in horror\
  \ movies and books. So we can say that I was trapped with ghosts\nAfter a long suffering,\
  \ the torches were still lit, were written in the walls of this castle a number\
  \ with the Song, it was the number 12, I did not know its meaning\nIt was almost\
  \ evening, it took me a long time to search for the paranormal specialist's house,\
  \ I arrived at a very interesting historical district which is between two museums,\
  \ the \"kakouki\" district there is a life amazing down!\nit was the time to have\
  \ logical explanations., according to the researcher the number 12 expresses a certain\
  \ fragility on the moral plane, it is a very strong reference, it is rather negative\
  \ in numerology, There are twelve principal deities of Greek mythology.\nThe 12th\
  \ also evokes the idea of abandonment or renunciation of something material, but\
  \ one ends up moving away from reality.\nSo it's your role now to look for its meaning\n\
  in this trip, I wanted to steal the secret of this number\nI saw this number everywhere,\
  \ it became a scary number for me\nSuddenly, my mother wakes me up: \"You got 15,12\
  \ and your father bought you a ticket to go see Greece ...\".\n_ \" Really ? You\
  \ told me 15,12? Oh no I will not go there.\nThe 12 is the number that follows me\
  \ throughout my life, accompanied by the number 9, They are indissociable,and made\
  \ me live a scary life."
