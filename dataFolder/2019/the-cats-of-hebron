Text: "Dark eyes, framed by heavy eyelids, Mo's face sticks in my mind.\n\nLarge and\
  \ black, those eyes seemed to burn with joy, or was it sadness. The man they were\
  \ attached to was divided. He loved his family but he did not belong with them,\
  \ trapped in the divided city of Hebron. Many travellers can tell you about Mo,\
  \ after all, he\u2019s welcomed nigh on a thousand strangers into his home and his\
  \ walls are covered with messages of love scrawled by past visitors.\n\nAs I shared\
  \ a sweet cup of tea with my host, two Germans arrived and we decided to set out\
  \ that afternoon for Abraham's tomb deep in the old town of Hebron. Considered the\
  \ father of Islam and Judaism, Abraham's tomb is yet another point of contention\
  \ between Israel and Palestine. In the current system, half of the tomb is visible\
  \ from a mosque and the other half from a synagogue.\n\nMo decided not to come with\
  \ us, it was Friday, and Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year), so the streets would be\
  \ strictly patrolled by Israeli soldiers. So it was that my new German companions\
  \ and I set out towards the old town, alone. The streets were deserted, except for\
  \ cats who eyed us suspiciously as we passed. One gnawed on a discarded slice of\
  \ pizza and many others pawed through bins. Windows and doors had been shuttered\
  \ on all sides.\nThe old town was scarcely more inviting. The cracked and cobbled\
  \ streets should have been crowded and lively, but all the stalls were closed and\
  \ chicken wire stretched from wall to wall above us, covering the sky. \n\nAn old\
  \ couple, the first people we had seen, were sat outside drinking tea, they seemed\
  \ as suspicious of us as the cats had been but greeted us nonetheless. When I asked\
  \ them what the wire was for they spat out one, angry word. Al-mustoutiin. Settlers.\
  \ A few Israeli settlements were established around Hebron some of which were above\
  \ the old town. These were well-guarded and difficult to access. The settlers above\
  \ and the Hebronites below used to throw rocks at each other for sport. The chicken\
  \ wire had been put there to 'protect\u2019 everyone, but standing below it, I couldn't\
  \ help but feel like I was in a cage.\n\nThe old couple pointed us in the direction\
  \ of the tomb and we continued through the winding streets, many of which had been\
  \ blocked off. As we drew nearer to the mosque, a few kids emerged to try and sell\
  \ us various trinkets and some cats inspected us for food, but all eventually slunk\
  \ off.\n\nFinally we reached what we thought must be the mosque only to find it\
  \ closed. Through one hole in the wall we could, however, see the tomb, and beyond\
  \ that a small congregation of Jews.\n\nResolving to try again in the morning, we\
  \ turned around and retraced our steps back to Mo\u2019s.\n\nAn unpleasant, acrid\
  \ smell grew stronger and upon reaching the edge of the deserted old town, the source\
  \ became immediately apparent. In the middle of the roundabout an old car was on\
  \ fire. A cat lay in the road basking in the heat from the flames; it was purring.\
  \ We hurried on.\n\nTo avoid the flames we took a side street that led to a parallel\
  \ road. We emerged and saw a group of young Palestinians sat on a doorstep, on our\
  \ other side a group of heavily-armed soldiers were yelling at them.\n\nOne of the\
  \ soldiers made a strange movement and there was a rattling noise in front of us.\
  \ \nA cat streaked past. \nThere was a deafening bang. \nA dazzling flash. \nAnd\
  \ all was still.\n\nI don't fully remember the journey back. Guided by shock and\
  \ adrenaline, we seemed to float. It wasn't until we were back at Mo's that we spoke\
  \ and began to process what had happened. Of course I knew about the conflict in\
  \ the region, and I had been told that Hebron in particular could be a flash point\
  \ but it had never occurred to me that I might find myself face to face with a grenade.\n\
  \nMo smiled balefully, \u201CWhat can you do?\u201D"
