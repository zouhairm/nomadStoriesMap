Text: It takes being in a different place to learn to appreciate the sun, not that
  it was never there, but being at that very emotional space in time allows one to
  be in tune with the everyday esoteric 'fluidities' of life. I had just landed on
  the lovely grounds of Durban, the cool air combing through my hair and kissing my
  flushed cheeks was enough to remind me of the whirlwind romance i have had with
  this place,,, for some long it had become the stable foundation of my traveling
  conquests (which are far and few in between). So here I am, looking like I had just
  stepped into the Mona Lisa picture perfect tale and I knew that yesterday's worries
  were just that. I had to remind myself that I am not here on a tuscany romance but
  for work,,, nobody said work had to be all gloom and doom, and what made my travels
  even more exciting is the fact that I was going to meet young, driven and ambitious
  people from all different socio-economic backgrounds. We were further to be enticed
  with the wisdom of scholars and constituents who have walked this long road we were
  preparing to embark on, my mind was blown. Here i was standing infront of what could
  be the beginning of the rest of my life, in one of my favorite holiday destinations,
  i was living part of my dream. The one thing we as people are always so conscious
  of did not matter; color and ethnicity, religion, power struggles created by racial
  profiling did not exist here, in this place we were all people trying to figure
  the next step from the first step and nothing was more exciting than the revelations
  that lay before me. The next four days had in them a few truths that were to question
  my moral stance, limboing on a truth that often persists in a true joy that turns
  ephemeral once it tingles the wound; see these days were going to remind me that
  this bubble of everyone having a free speech is nothing but an illusion, that feminism
  is shunned upon behind closed doors, that color does actually matter, leaving people
  in a morally dubious state- all of that lay before this honeymoon moment I was having
  in seminar rooms and hotel sittings, i learned that everything is not as good as
  it feels, that no matter how beautiful the scenery is of a sun setting over the
  peaceful ocean,,, at the end that's the only beauty we have amidst the ugliness
  of this world. As we strolled on the beach during the day with my new found compadres,
  all happy and taking photos, something caught my eye,,, I saw a grandmother playing
  with her grandchild on the beach as the mom had her time with the waves, i saw a
  nuclear family, both mom and dad adoring their little baby, what melted my heart
  was the couple that passed me, with their little one in a stroller, their baby's
  excitement as she waved at me overwhelmed me, but the baby's parents just passed
  me without returning my greeting- that turned a glorious moment into a bittersweet
  aphrodisiac,,, I realised that life can be a fairytale and that children don't see
  color but people, their idea of the world is pure up until it is altered and completely
  changed by preconceived notions resulting from childhood experiences,,, we are faultless
  as children, life rips us of our ability to go through it unscathed, our ideas of
  relationships become a horrible challenge instead of a beautiful exchange. When
  I returned to my hotel room to gaze at the beautiful view of sky scrapers and the
  ocean, i realised that as a child i had been shielded from the truth by my pure
  heart, not that the ugly didn't exist, but i wanted to believe that there's only
  good in the world, but when I returned home, i realised that I had to travel a couple
  of kilometers to discover a truth that was not disturbing but rather unchallenged,,,
  no beautiful view can change the reality that meets us everyday, brazenly we meet
  this reality.
