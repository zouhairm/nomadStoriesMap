Text: "Travelling to Europe had always been a dream of mine. That dream turned into\
  \ a reality on March 2017. Excitement gets the better of people, but for me I remained\
  \ calm. Way too calm as I did not prepare much for the trip. I did not have the\
  \ right clothings, I did not have a hotel booking right till the last day. I would\
  \ be kickstarting my tour in Europe starting with Oslo. Since it was a day before\
  \ the trip, the hotel prices were expensive. \n\nI knew that I had made a mistake\
  \ of waiting too long. However, I did not let it dampen my spirit. I downloaded\
  \ an app called Couchsurfers and found out that I could stay with a local, on a\
  \ basis where we exchange conversations about cultures and lifestyle. Being from\
  \ a diverse country like Singapore, I believed that there were lots of topics for\
  \ me to discuss. I created a profile and honestly stated my situation and waited\
  \ for humanity to do its thing. Thankfully, an ex US Marine, currently residing\
  \ in Oslo, decided to house me for a week. \n\nI was stoked, but still not prepared.\
  \ Singapore is a tropical country where temperatures range between 25deg to 35deg.\
  \ People like me are dying to experience the cold climate. I got too carried away\
  \ as I told myself, I could brave the cold.  I was dressed in a T-shirt and berms\
  \ and we took off to Oslo. \n\nUpon reaching Oslo, I went outside the airport to\
  \ light up a cigarette. The self belief I had where I thought I could face it all\
  \ died down as I was shivering uncontrollably. The fellow smokers were exchanging\
  \ looks of confusion. I\u2019m pretty sure they have not seen a man dressed like\
  \ this. Not wanting to prolong this state of confusion for the rest and uneasiness\
  \ for myself, I went back to change. \n\nMy next task was to find the home of the\
  \ person offering me his stay. Oslo\u2019s rap network was quite easy to follow,\
  \ so I reached the train station nearest to his home without a problem. \n\nThe\
  \ problem was only about to begin now.\n\n Firstly, an unexpected snow hit the town.\
  \ It was not supposed to be snowing but it started to snow heavily. I have not experienced\
  \ snow and in any other moment I would\u2019ve embraced this moment, but I was under\
  \ a lot of pressure at this moment, as I did not know what to anticipate. \n\nSecondly,\
  \ the SIM card that I bought for internet connection, did not have reception. Therefore\
  \ right now I am unable to call the person, or look at my google maps. I was stuck\
  \ in an unknown town, with no internet, no housing, no sense of direction; with\
  \ a heavy snow downfall.\n\nThis is where humanity does its things. When all hope\
  \ was lost, there came a man walking towards me. I thought to myself, maybe this\
  \ is the guy who is gone house me. Before I could say a word, he started talking\
  \ to me in Norwegian. I apologised and told him that I only speak English. He was\
  \ quite surprised as this was a small community and was not really a tourist attraction,\
  \ he was puzzled on my reasons for visiting the town. That man also told me that\
  \ he saw me shivering in the cold while looking out of the window, he offered me\
  \ coffee at his home. \n\nI thought a coffee would be a good idea to compose my\
  \ thoughts and also to ask him for directions to my place or stay. Upon reaching\
  \ his house I told him my situation. He suggested me to go to the petrol kiosk and\
  \ find his grandson who is better at directions. I thanked him and seeked help from\
  \ his grandson. Eventually, I reached my destination, with the grandson protecting\
  \ me by carrying and umbrella over my head.\n\nI stepped into the unknown, not knowing\
  \ what to expect. I wanted to see the beauty of the world through skyscrapers and\
  \ nature. However, the beauty amongst humans; is indeed the most beautiful. Through\
  \ humanity and the joy of helping, I managed to stay safe in the unknown."
