Text: "I love travelling a lot. Live in the moments at that time and respect my breath\
  \ in the warmth of the beautiful, amazing views and humble people. \n\n***\n\nOne\
  \ of the most amazing capital city in a province in Indonesia was Kendari. You can\
  \ find this place in Southeast Sulawesi Province, you'll feel very surprise about\
  \ this place cause this place has a hilly land and rivers. Its a kind of beautiful\
  \ city cause it has a hilly waterfall which formed  thousands years ago.\n\n***\n\
  \nIn that place, there is a very famous and amazing place called Moramo Waterfall.\
  \ Where the waterfall is very beautiful with a multilevel arrangement of rocks.\n\
  \n***\n\nThis waterfall formed naturally for thousands of years. Soothing eyes see\
  \ the water flowing heavily on granite stones arranged in stages, dropping clear\
  \ water from a height of 100 meters. I am grateful to see for myself the panorama\
  \ of the beauty of Moramo Waterfall. We also started our ritual, plunging and playing\
  \ water like little children.\n\n***\n\nIndonesia like a hidden gold which should\
  \ be digged into the dept inside of the hidden place itself. Indonesia not only\
  \ Bali, or Sabang, or Lombok or etc. \n\n***\n\nJust like dusk, we can find the\
  \ beauty of twilight everywhere, just like Indonesia, we only need to look to be\
  \ able to get other beauties in the corners of the city and even villages. The country\
  \ of Indonesia has many other beauties that have not been explored by anyone.\n\n\
  ***\n\nThe adventures can be found only by the adventurer."
