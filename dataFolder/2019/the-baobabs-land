Text: "I was 14 years old when my mom, as crazy as she is, said yes to a job opportunity\
  \ in Luanda. Months later, and a lot of tears after, I took my first steps into\
  \ the land of the baobabs.\nThe end of the world for a teenager looks much like\
  \ this: a country at about 8 hours flight distance of her friends, routines and\
  \ comfort zone and a chaotic city where the same age kids would be selling goods\
  \ for money instead of going shopping.   \nLooking back it was only the start of\
  \ my world! \nYou either like it or hate it and I, really, just miss it.\nTo enjoy\
  \ the trip that we are about to do you'll need to leave your \"European routines\"\
  \ and high heels at the airport and embrace a spirit of adventure and acceptance.\n\
  The airplane's door just opened and you can feel the hot breeze, smell that wet\
  \ earth that everyone talks about and that's when you start begging for a shower.\
  \ \nThe poverty is one of those things you can't hide and everyone tries to do something\
  \ for a little tip, so expect them to help you with your bags. They don't ask for\
  \ money but they make you want to give it to them! \nLook at how lucky you are now:\
  \ you just found the place where you can shop in the streets while driving home\
  \ because, believe me, they'll have what the stores won't.  \n Negotiate! Use my\
  \ dad's sentence: \"sou pula mas sou angolano\", which means \"I'm white but I'm\
  \ native\".\nPut yourself in their shoes! It's one of the richest cities in the\
  \ world with a population that doesn't have money to buy food and feel embarrassed\
  \ to eat in the same table as a white guy inside of the only shopping mall that\
  \ existed at the time.\nWhen it's hot, there is no fancy machine that can help you\
  \ and  when it rains, the best is to look for Noah's Ark and wait until the water\
  \ goes away because Luanda literally stops.\nBut the war scars are still very present,\
  \ both in people and in buildings, and that's why I still call it the land of the\
  \ abandoned palaces and lost paradises. \nNow you're coming back, and while you're\
  \ stuck in the usual traffic, I hope you remember this land just like I do: the\
  \ baobabs home. I hope you can't forget the humble people that used to call \"big\
  \ father\" to my dad and \"the oldest\" to my mom in the most loving way possible.\
  \ \nThe smell of wet earth and the red sunset. The taste of the mangos and the size\
  \ of the fish. The kids that in a different reality could have been just like you,\
  \ but in this one look happier and make you understand that you don't know a thing."
