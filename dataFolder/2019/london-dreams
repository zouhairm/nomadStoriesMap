Text: "I am from India and luckily I got the opportunity to visit University of Bristol\
  \ in 2018. While I was there the whole country was a adventures place to explore.\
  \ The colourfull culture, beautiful people, artistic streets , historical monuments\
  \ and the blue ocean everything was new and amazing for me. \nIt was a great experience\
  \ to know about the place so closely and live each moment. \nBest part of my trip\
  \ was the culture and food specially fish n chips.  Places like Bristol, Bath, Oxford,\
  \ central London, Isle of white was been the centre of attraction for me.\n\nI got\
  \ the opportunity to attend the academic environment of the UK which was a great\
  \ experience. Everyone I have encountered were very helpful, joyful, full of positivity\
  \ and creative mindset.\n\nI was staying there with one british family which included\
  \ a couple and their two adorable cutie little girls. So, being with a family I\
  \ got the opportunity to be a part of British culture closely. \n\nAlthough I am\
  \ not a solo traveler but being solo in Bristol fortunately developed this \"solo\
  \ traveler\" characteristic in me. My solo super dooper first visit was to Bath-\
  \ an ancient village of the country. It has its own amazing ancient history which\
  \ I didn't know till I accidentally met one history teacher-Eric, who explained\
  \ me each minute things about the ancient cathedral of the village. After that I\
  \ was wondering about the each wonderful places of the country and tried to explore\
  \ it. \nOne thing about the culture I liked was the cheerful nature of the people.\
  \ Everyone were very particular about spending good time with there near and dear\
  \ ones. While being busy through out the week they never missed the chance to spend\
  \ quality time on weekends with the friends and family.\n\nEach part of the country\
  \ is very beautiful and I love the colourfull culture of the country. It was been\
  \ the life long experience for me and I would love to explore the other parts of\
  \ the world's so closely.\n\nRegards\nSANJANA"
