Text: "When I arrived in Thailand completely exhausted and jetlagged, making selfies\
  \ and visiting my new job environement in that same state. I did not expect to find\
  \ my self on a stage reading to peoples, about self-acceptance and how we all carry\
  \ this or that bad memory of mobbing, isolation or other insecurities of past experiences.\
  \ It was an open stage evening as they are easy to find in big cities nowadays and\
  \ I was coming here every Friday for two years now listening to mediocre music,\
  \ readings, and poetry. Sometimes even worth to be listened to. I was the last person\
  \ to perform that evening. \nI sat there on that stage, looking into peoples faces\
  \ with shaky knees: We are all experts in our happy go lucky traveler state to hide,\
  \ the green hair, I read out loud, hiding our insecurities, our childishness, and\
  \ our innate inability to actually hide it. I finished my reading with the words:\
  \ \"I hope you can be a little bit more enough who you are today. You are enough!\"\
  \ I started crying. At that time I had spent already two years in Thailand, in that\
  \ company in Chiang Mai, a city in the north of Thailand filled with healers, yoga\
  \ enthusiasts, digital nomads, and sex tourists. I realized I was really reading\
  \ to myself. For two years I had tried to please, entertain and convince the wrong\
  \ people. The mobbing, the isolation, the people that made sure I know I am not\
  \ invited to whatever they were gonna do, the laughter behind my back and the open\
  \ or hidden unkind words and gestures. Had I become this blind? I was showering\
  \ myself every evening with salt, to get rid of the bad energies I told myself,\
  \ after a long day at work and the social life afterward. I had become a shadow\
  \ of myself, a convincer, an opportunist, an entertainer, and even a sex object.\
  \ I was crying, I was the biggest unworthiness and failure sitting on this stage\
  \ surrounded by peoples. Peoples applauded. There I was showing my green hair. I\
  \ am enough."
