Text: "Wilmer reaches over to fiddle with the radio dial. There\u2019s a crackle of\
  \ static for a few seconds before excitable Spanish chatter begins to seep through\
  \ the white noise. I\u2019m able to decipher the words \u201CViva Cuba\u201D and\
  \ \u201CViva la Revolucion\u201D but not much else. He lets go of the tuner and\
  \ gives up with a sigh.\n\u201CI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to get you any\
  \ closer.\u201D\n\nThe traffic in central Havana is bumper to bumper with no sign\
  \ of moving. Wilmer nervously fingers his rosary beads while looking for a gap in\
  \ which to squeeze his creaking Chevy. He\u2019s fiercely proud of the car, despite\
  \ its original metallic blue paint slowly deteriorating into the pools of orange\
  \ rust that are gradually expanding across the exterior. It had been off the road\
  \ for 3 months while Wilmer waited for a single replacement part, such is the pace\
  \ of anything in Cuba. This is his first run out in it and I\u2019m surprised to\
  \ be offered a ride.\n\nI reach over to the radio on the dashboard and twist the\
  \ knob, hoping to hear some information fizzing through the ancient speakers.\n\u201C\
  There are a lot of people here\u2026\u201D I mused, attempting to break the frustrated\
  \ silence with mundane small talk. We\u2019re surrounded by busses filled with uniformed\
  \ Cubans; Nurses, police, agricultural workers. He nods, lost in the vehicular chaos.\
  \ I had been told that almost a million people would be descending on Plaza de la\
  \ Revolucion for the May Day march. I had an inkling that the numbers were an inflated\
  \ estimate - a propaganda stunt - but the traffic tells me otherwise.\n\nThe morning\
  \ sun is finally beginning to make itself known, illuminating the crumbling facades\
  \ of the street\u2019s brightly coloured townhouse. Voyeurs sit on the ramshackle\
  \ balconies waving paper flags at the crowd. On the pavements below people dance\
  \ to small, worn-looking stereos blasting out reggae-ton or sitting in clouds of\
  \ barbeque smoke, getting their fill of party food while knocking back cans of Cristal.\
  \ \n\nThere had been a week-long build up on all the front pages, state-sponsored\
  \ news and posters around town. We had spotted workers erecting the stages under\
  \ the watchful eye of the plaza\u2019s huge Che mural over a week before. By that\
  \ point, flags and streamers had already covered the streets.\nA lot is said about\
  \ how the Unions and the government force workers to attend, threatening to dock\
  \ pay and slash bonuses of abstainers. To some outsiders, May Day in Havana is all\
  \ for show, a PR stunt to demonstrate how happy the population is with both the\
  \ regime and their working conditions.\nEach time I try to bring the subject up\
  \ with Wilmer, he deflects, shifting in his seat and giving me a look, one that\
  \ says that he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. His opinion on the Cuban government\
  \ was clear, if unspoken. He had studied economics at university before giving it\
  \ up to become a tour guide, \u201CIronically, there\u2019s no money in economics\u2026\
  \ not in Cuba anyway.\u201D\n\nEventually, he breaks.\n\n\u201CA lot of people want\
  \ to be here,\u201D he reassures me. \u201CSome for the fiesta, others to support\
  \ the government.\u201D\n\nI reach down to wind up the window; it\u2019s easier\
  \ to take the stifling heat inside the car than the sooty exhaust fumes emanating\
  \ from the street. \n\u201CAnd you?\u201D I ask him. Wilmer squirms again. \u201C\
  No\u2026I think\u2026.\u201D He trails off, grasping his rosary beads and crucifix\
  \ tightly.\n\nWith that, I leave Wilmer to deal with the congestion and I walk the\
  \ remainder of the journey, squeezing through the metal barriers to merge with the\
  \ pulsating river of red, white and blue flowing down Paseo Boulevard towards the\
  \ square\u2019s imposing Jose Marti Monument.\n\nA chorus of \u2018La Bayamesa\u2019\
  \ rings out from the crowd. Some march solemnly in their uniforms, even more are\
  \ dancing and drinking. I\u2019m jostled from side to side and carried with the\
  \ flow until I feel a steadying hand on each shoulder. I don\u2019t know the man,\
  \ but he seems ecstatic to have found me, drunk on the half empty bottle of Havana\
  \ Club tucked in his waistband. \u201CViva Cuba!\u201D he screams in my face, \u201C\
  and Viva la Revolucion!\u201D"
