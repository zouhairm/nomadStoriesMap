Text: "Our first day of work was a half-day since it was New Year\u2019s Eve. All\
  \ of Spain was asleep the afternoon before midnight when the skies lit up with fireworks,\
  \ the streets filled up with Spaniards eating grapes, and friends popped 5-euro\
  \ bottles of champagne they bought on the sidewalk corner as a joke. That was the\
  \ first day I really got to know him. And suddenly, the sounds of Madrid reminded\
  \ me of his chuckle. The green of the trees in El Parque Retiro reminded me of the\
  \ deep color of his eyes. And the warmth of the air reminded me of his arms, wrapped\
  \ around me, lips smiling into my hair, the rise and fall of his chest against my\
  \ back.\n\nIf there is one thing I\u2019ve been sure of since I was a child, it\u2019\
  s that I had always wanted to be a writer. Words were infectious and putting ink\
  \ to paper became my solace. But I had also gone through several phases of the kind\
  \ of writing I\u2019d wanted to do. I'd bounced back and forth, between short stories,\
  \ novels, investigative journalism, screenwriting, back to novels. And then I discovered\
  \ the beauty of being a writer: you could do it all.\n\nInitially, I wasn\u2019\
  t sure what I was looking for when I booked my flight to Spain. I'd signed up to\
  \ work as an intern for a company abroad, but didn't know what to expect. It didn\u2019\
  t help that I had no idea what to do with a finance degree. \"Consulting experience\
  \ is a valuable experience,\" I heard from everyone when I mentioned my cluelessness.\
  \ But I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d fall in love with the country more than the work--at\
  \ least, not to the extent of where I now consider it my second home. And I didn\u2019\
  t I think I would meet someone like him. But above all, the least expected outcome?\
  \ Finding love, which led to unearthing what it is I truly want to do with my life.\n\
  \nHe doesn\u2019t know this, but the love I have for the city of Madrid came partly\
  \ from the way his spirit leaked into the city. Maybe this is why I thought I was\
  \ falling for him instead. My deep infatuation with the way Puerto del Sol lit up\
  \ at night and my love for the churros and chocolate at Chocolateria San Gin\xE9\
  s were part of the affair I was having with the entire city of Madrid, not with\
  \ him. I'd fallen in love with the people and hearty conversations, the small hole-in-the-wall\
  \ bars we visited, and the elite clubs we danced in until 4 AM.  My heart found\
  \ sanctuary in the cozy, packed space of El Tigre, where the mojitos were as strong\
  \ as the rumbling laughs. The writer in me was suddenly itching to talk about my\
  \ newfound life of two weeks. And I had his knowledge of the city to thank (though\
  \ fading a bit after two years) since it was what caused me to fall in love with\
  \ more than the shiny, more popular tourist sites.\n\nI\u2019d grown up with immigrant\
  \ parents, so traveling had played an important role in my life. Possessing an unquenchable\
  \ thirst for absorbing local customs, traditions, and habits, my mind was a desert\
  \ and these elements of travel were the water in the flask that kept running out--I\
  \ always wanted more. It felt familiar to make small conversations with the aging\
  \ shopkeepers and the bartender with the fleur de lis tattoo who was ever so curious\
  \ about my ethnicity and American accent and exclaimed he had always dreamed of\
  \ going to New York but could never leave behind the simple, sprawling beauty of\
  \ Madrid. And for this reason, too, I began to swim in the ocean that was the life\
  \ in the city. I found life pulsating throughout El Parque Retiro, where the ducks\
  \ and swans swam in pairs, chattering away. I witnessed decades of love between\
  \ an elderly couple that sat on the steps overlooking the water, holding hands.\n\
  \nI\u2019ve always been a storyteller. And thanks to my passionate, unexpected,\
  \ whirlwind of an affair, I\u2019ve finally found my place and purpose."
