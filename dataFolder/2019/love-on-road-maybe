Text: "God wants you to be at some places at certain time in your life. Sometimes\
  \ it's a getaway from all your life problems and bringing you all the solutions\
  \ with the new people and adventures. I was in Egypt for a internship for 1 and\
  \ a half month. This trip will always be close to my heart because I met a person\
  \ who taught me the real meaning of love . Before this trip I loved a guy for more\
  \ than 10 years, but he didn't . We are still best friends. I never felt what does\
  \ someone loving me feels like, how it feels when someone goes a little to far to\
  \ just put a smile on my face, or someone running around the streets on 4 am serching\
  \ a medicine for me, someone who knows what I really need at what time. \nWe've\
  \ always studied about Egypt. But never thought it will create such a beautiful\
  \ space in my life. \nSometimes the love you give to someone doesn't always returns\
  \ to you from the same person.\nI've spent most beautifull days of my life drinking\
  \ egyptian tea watching sunrise. Nothing is more beautifull than sitting infront\
  \ of the red Sea spotting the sky changing it's colours from blue to red, listening\
  \ the sound of waves and wind running down your skin with a chilling sensation all\
  \ over your hands. \nNothing more crazier than dancing on the faluka boat on Nile\
  \ river in Cairo with your friends on insane Indian beats. \nI visited Egypt during\
  \ Ramadan. And that is the best duration one can visit this country. Because you\
  \ get to experience the real culture and festive food during this time of the year.\
  \ People their are so great and so loving Everytime I told someone I was from India\
  \ , they hugged me with a smile and invited me for tea."
