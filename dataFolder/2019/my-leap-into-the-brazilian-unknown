Text: "Do you ever look back and realize you can pinpoint one decision that defines\
  \ who and where you are right now? For me, that was choosing to ditch my cushy job,\
  \ to do research in a biochemistry-lab in Brazil. This was a leap into the unknown\
  \ for many reasons, not least, that I didn\u2019t know a soul; didn\u2019t speak\
  \ any Portuguese and had little-to-no lab experience! The early months were a tangled\
  \ blur of conflicting emotions \u2013 dominated by a feeling of complete and utter\
  \ inadequacy. Every lab meeting involved a lot of smiling and nodding, while surreptitiously\
  \ jotting down words like \u201Cbuffer\u201D and \u201Cgel-electrophoresis\u201D\
  \ to later google. Every step outside the door was an adventure, given that no-one\
  \ understood a word I said, and even if they did, I didn\u2019t understand the response.\
  \ Nothing was straightforward, not even nipping out to the supermarket. There literally\
  \ wasn\u2019t one area of my life where I felt like I was winning - or even keeping\
  \ up. \n\nA stand-out moment from those first few months happened on a weekend beach\
  \ trip. It had been another week of absolute confusion (coupled with those strong\
  \ and familiar feelings of inadequacy!). But hey-ho, the sun was shining and I decided\
  \ to head to the beach. Getting there was another adventure. I held up the queue\
  \ at the bus station for what felt like 30 minutes (but was probably closer to 5!)\
  \ because the ticket-man couldn\u2019t understand my accent and/or terrible Portuguese.\
  \ I accidentally got off the bus 2 miles from my destination and had to lug my bags\
  \ along in the searing mid-day heat.  But I eventually made it, and took myself\
  \ out for a congratulatory dinner-date with my trusty kindle. The juicy burger and\
  \ icy-cold beer revived me a lot, so later on, when the hostel-owner suggested I\
  \ join him and his friend at a forr\xF3 concert on the beach I decided to go for\
  \ it. When we were there, the hostel-guy asked me to dance. My initial instinct\
  \ was to say no, given that my version of dancing is an awkward left-left-foot shuffle,\
  \ with simultaneous shoulder lurch. But I was in Brazil, I could feel the sand between\
  \ my toes, the moon was shining brightly, and the hostel-guy was extremely handsome!\
  \ So off I went, and man was that a leap into the unknown. When Irish people dance,\
  \ we typically just jump up and down, in some vague approximation of the timing\
  \ of the beat. People don\u2019t touch each other (unless they are very drunk and/or\
  \ about to get it on) So when this guy put his arms around me, to lead me in the\
  \ forr\xF3, I had absolutely no idea what was going on. All my gringa inadequacies\
  \ came flooding back. Where should I put my hands? How close should I be? Is it\
  \ normal in Brazil for a guy to hold a girl this closely? For some reason, this\
  \ dance sums up that one pervasive thought that dominated those early months, which\
  \ was: I have absolutely no idea what the hell is going on here. \n\nI sometimes\
  \ ask myself if giving up that nice cushy job to leap into the Brazilian unknown\
  \ was worth it? The answer? Hell yes!  Because deciding to leave that job wasn\u2019\
  t just about swapping a Scottish university for a Brazilian one - it was about deciding\
  \ that job satisfaction is more important than money or security; that the unknown\
  \ is more exciting than scary; that closing one door just alerts us to all the other\
  \ open one\u2019s, and most important of all, that everything I needed to up-sticks\
  \ and create a new life, was already inside me. \n\nI\u2019ve been living here for\
  \ three years now. That lab that scared me so much \u2013 I\u2019m now heading-up\
  \ projects. I have the articulacy of a toddler, but I can speak enough Portuguese\
  \ to survive. And best of all, that guy whose intentions I couldn\u2019t quite decipher\
  \ during that very awkward beach-dance? Well it turns out Brazilians don\u2019t\
  \ typically dance that close and it was a come-on, and three years later, he\u2019\
  s still laughing at my awkward dance attempts, but his arms are still around me,\
  \ while he guides me through the steps."
