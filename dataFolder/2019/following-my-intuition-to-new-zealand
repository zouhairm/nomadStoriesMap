Text: "You know the unspoken thoughts keeping you up at night, staring into the emptiness,\
  \ wondering why you're here? Wishing for something else, somewhere else? That little\
  \ voice inside of your head is trying to tell you something. Are you listening?\
  \ Or is your mind consumed by the chaos of this external world, the noise attempting\
  \ to tame the unwavering source of strength trembling beneath your surface. Freedom\
  \ lingers at the edge of your fear. \nI woke up and googled the safest place in\
  \ the world. \nNew Zealand was one of the destinations on the list. My intuition\
  \ was telling me to book the ticket. I found a one way ticket that was fairly cheap.\
  \ I applied for a one year visa and closed my laptop. The next few days consisted\
  \ of selling old things, decluttering, and getting ready to pack my life into a\
  \ backpack. I was manifesting this magic through my fingertips. \nIt was a muggy\
  \ Thursday morning, I was sipping on green tea, and I opened my laptop to receive\
  \ an email that my visa to New Zealand had been accepted. I booked the one way ticket.\
  \ \nAugust 2018, a new earth emerged at my fingertips. I watched as dawn gently\
  \ gathered the stars lingering in a pale indigo sky and slipped the moon beneath\
  \ her sheets. I listened as the waves softly kissed backyard coastlines and pine\
  \ trees hugged the cliffs. I found a van to live out of in this little sliver of\
  \ neverland, lost in a crystalline sea. The birds exhaled sang me beautiful lullabies.\
  \ I woke up with the whole world wrapped around me, in an island in the middle of\
  \ the sea. New Zealand captured my heart.\nI did van life for months, immersing\
  \ myself into untouched nature. Getting lost through endless green hills filled\
  \ with sheep and cow. Meeting fellow strangers on the same journey as me. Waking\
  \ up in a new place each day. My soul at ease. My heart swirling with gratitude\
  \ as I trek through this journey of the unknown, following my intuition, moment\
  \ by moment."
