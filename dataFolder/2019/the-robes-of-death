Text: "How does one put hindsight and foresight on the table and prepare the dish\
  \ called now? \n\nA couple of years ago, I watched a movie by the name of 'Mukti\
  \ Bhavan,' translated loosely as 'Hotel Salvation.\" The basic premise of the movie\
  \ is exploration of this inevitable phenomenon called death, through the desire\
  \ of one man who in his mid-seventy's has decided that his time on this plane has\
  \ come to an end. He wishes to embark on this journey by moving to Varanasi, a city\
  \ on the banks of the Ganga, where Hindus come to be liberated from the cycle of\
  \ birth and rebirth that is at the root of mankind's suffering. To do this though,\
  \ one has to be granted admission into this waiting room, that gives the movie its\
  \ title. Each pilgrim who signs on has only fifteen days or less to die, or else\
  \ he/she has to leave. The caretaker however very carefully assures each one coming\
  \ through that if should it not happen, the stay can be extended simply by the changing\
  \ of one's name until the desired goal is achieved. Through a multitude of relationships,\
  \ the movie poignantly explores the question - can life be lived in the waiting\
  \ room of death? \nEver since I was a child, I have had an up close and personal\
  \ relationship with death; beginning with the loss of my two-month old sister when\
  \ I was 6 years old. Over the years, I closely witnessed the death of my nanny gasping\
  \ for air from an asthma attack on the balcony of my flat; my father from a stroke\
  \ that left him a quadriplegic and bed-ridden for two years; my neighbor along with\
  \ her 18-month old daughter and grandmother-in-law in a violent car crash; my grandmother\
  \ to aspiration; my mother-in-law to cancer; and my father-in-law, who willfully\
  \ chose to die at his son's place over two weeks. Each passing away was unique in\
  \ its own right; offering me distinctive insight into how those left behind dealt\
  \ with the loss. Given that all were Hindus, the ashes were immediately scattered\
  \ into a flowing river followed by a period of intense mourning for thirteen days.\
  \ During this period, at least three hours every evening were spent singing 'bhajans,'\
  \ to console the self and family and the deceased's belongings were donated. The\
  \ end of mourning was marked by a large community dinner following which each one\
  \ was free to return to the mundane life. \nNow, I am a physician assistant in oncology\
  \ and my friendship with death continues. I have discussions of 'letting go' and\
  \ 'surrendering' with patients and their family members at the same time we talk\
  \ about how best can life be prolonged. But how do I make them understand the urgency\
  \ that comes with the lack of time and that it would be in their best interest to\
  \ dive in head first to comprehend the workings of an experience that they did not\
  \ sign up for? It then becomes my job to peel of layers of issues that have been\
  \ and remain difficult to address. How do I remain involved and yet detached in\
  \ this journey? How can I make them deal with their past and wrap-up undone deals\
  \ and bring to a closure contracts that they have placed on the back burner? How\
  \ do I get them to learn to receive care and unlearn self-dependency? Will they\
  \ let go of their cynicism and self-doubt and instead rely on faith and trust? Will\
  \ they ever learn to love and accept themselves for who they truly are? Or will\
  \ they remain resistant, thereby increasing their own and by extension, the suffering\
  \ of their caretakers? \nThrough my familiar relationship with death, I am reminded\
  \ of the Hawaiian prayer chant, 'Kumulipo,' which translates to 'beginning in deep\
  \ darkness.' Here darkness does not connote gloom and evil, but rather the obscure\
  \ chaos that reigns before germination; following which order prevails. Or, does\
  \ it? \nIn conclusion, I am reminded of a quote from 'Desert Solitaire' by Edward\
  \ Abbey; \"May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome. dangerous, leading to\
  \ the most amazing views.\""
