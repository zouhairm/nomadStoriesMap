Text: "\"Republic Of India\" passport had a Visa for the first International visit\
  \ for a legal summer school and I could not be happier. The gaiety needed no words,\
  \ my face glowed and I took a deep breath. Seemed like my first steps of exploring\
  \ the world. I flew off to the hub of beers and the Cold War Charlie. I flew into\
  \ a city so close to my heart yet a little unknown. Gulping my nervous senses with\
  \ a smile on my face I stepped off for a journey to remember my lifetime. I checked\
  \ into the Meininger Hotel booked as a residence for the students of summer school\
  \ and their tiny little rooms came to my utter surprise for the vibrancy they possessed.\
  \ The colorful buildings, romantic bridges, and hypnotizing salsa indicated the\
  \ magic of the city I was into. I bumped into a man with a wide smile, mesmerizing\
  \ hazel eyes, supple skin that felt familiar and language that made me feel amongst\
  \ the city since forever. \"Hi, are you ok?, he said and my lips spread wide in\
  \ the amazement of the love I was receiving from the city. \nWalking down the streets,\
  \ stumbling upon the rocks like a child in me, I knew I was learning to fly. The\
  \ concentration camps and the befog personality of the Adolf Hitler were astounding\
  \ me with the multifaceted streams and events that the International Criminal Law\
  \ had in its bag for me. The Reichstag, Brandenburg Gate and Wall of Berlin had\
  \ great historical significance than they seem to possess.\nThe cereal yogurt of\
  \ Berlin is a must have breakfast for everyone who visits this magnificent place.\
  \ The sausage of the currywurst could lead you to different Bollywood songs and\
  \ make you fall in love with it in just a bite.  The vagabonds on the streets with\
  \ guitars in their hands and singing to their own tunes is a sight to remember.\
  \ The sun sets on a boat ride with a beer in the hand and dancing on the boho music\
  \ is a treat to the soul. Once you visit Berlin, you can definitely not miss upon\
  \ the shopping complexes like the Primark. It is lit. \nThe German people, the food\
  \ everything has its own magic. While I was joined by my friend in the second week\
  \ of summer school, we decided to visit the Botanical Garden post the classes. On\
  \ our way, we came across a coffee shop and stood by chit chatting in our native\
  \ language. The guy handed us our coffee and was quietly observing our talks. While,\
  \ we ended up our chat we asked for the bill, while he simply smiled and asked us\
  \ in Hindi, to which place we belonged. We replied India while he introduced himself\
  \ to us and said that we are brothers and said he was from Pakistan. We were moved.\
  \ While our introduction with Imran got over, we asked for the bill. His words had\
  \ a different happy tone to them \"aap humare bhai hai, humari bhasha bolte hai,\
  \ itna to hum apke liye kar hi skte hai\" which meant \"you're my brother, you speak\
  \ my language, this is the least I can help you with. We had nothing but tears of\
  \ happiness in our eyes because it was not the amount of bill but his gesture that\
  \ paved the way for us to believe that we are surrounded by love and segregated\
  \ by boundaries. We are united by humanity and divided by politics. We share love\
  \ and brotherhood but are divided by religions."
