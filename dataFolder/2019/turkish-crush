Text: "It's hard to count how many actions, causes, unexpected events brought me that\
  \ determinated day in that determinated place.\n\nAnkara was the last stopover of\
  \ my trip in Turkey but actually I did' t want to be there. \nAll the travellers\
  \ I met, along the way, suggested me to not waste my time in that city but my flight\
  \ back to home was going to leave in two days from there.\n\nI spent my prevoius\
  \ week in Capadocia having breathtaking trekkings, exploring uncontaminated places,\
  \ talking with locals; so, in short, I got my haven of peace.\nThe region realeses\
  \ an incredible magnetic energy that attracts thousands of travellers from all over\
  \ the world; originally I planned to stay here just for three days but if had had\
  \ the possibilty probably I'd still looking for new path to follow, along some valleys\
  \ by the bizarre names.\n\nThat's why a sudden sadness assaulted me as soon as I\
  \ bought my ticket to catch the bus from Goreme to Ankara, my journey was going\
  \ to finish.\n\nAfter almost seven hours trip, I reach my destination: during this\
  \ lapse of time I realised I didn't really know anything about the city where I\
  \ am excluding it doesn't have any noteworthy football team like Istanbul.\n\nFortunately\
  \ I get easily to my hostel, randomly chosen the day before; the couch becomes in\
  \ a flash my best frend and nothing would have separated from it. It's friday night\
  \ but there's no one around; probably all the guests are  living the Ankara's nigtlife\
  \ that I decided to not attend to that day.\n\nI rest my eyes till when a voice\
  \ takes me back to reality \"Did you have dinner?\"\nI can't say  if was more suprised\
  \ at the semplicity of the question or at the fact she was already sharing her borek\
  \ with me; by the way, I was hungry so I gladly accept the offer.\nWhen I travel,\
  \ one of my favourite game is recognizing where people comes from but it's a hard\
  \ challenge with the person I've in front of.\nI guess spanish. She laughs at me.\
  \ I quickly give up but she likes this game .She tells me she is from Turkey but\
  \ she is not turkish. I'm defintely  more confused than I was before.\nShe reveals\
  \ me she is kurdish; I admit her my ignorance.\nMisunderstandings are so funny.\
  \ Thanks God.\nShe is Nerima and she is in Ankara for the weekend to attend biotechnology\
  \ conferences: it's so easy talking with her. Hope was the same for her.\nI didn't\
  \ expect anyththing for my stay in this city, much less being in that situation\
  \ but we are both tired, so, we decide to date the next day after her commitment.\n\
  \nThere's not so much time to live the city; at a glance Ankara is an occidental\
  \ capital, the comparison with Istanbul is unavoidable but I decide to look beyond\
  \ appaearences.\nI get lost triying to reach Ataturk Mausoleum: I notice that I'm\
  \ already inside. It's massive, it's a whole neighborhood: it definetely got me\
  \ the sense of the statesman'size in turkish's history.\nI'm really impressed but\
  \ my head is elsewhere: can't wait to meet up again Nerima.\n\nShe joins me there\
  \ but time is running out, her bus to Izmir will leave in few hours.\nDespite was\
  \ almost December, a mild weather evening allows us to have a peacfull walk with\
  \ no destination.\nNo idea of the way we took but in two hours we shared everything\
  \ of us; further confirmation that often talking is simpler with a totally stranger.\n\
  The sight of a mosque is an occasion for Nerima to rely me that she wants to escape\
  \ from Turkey, maybe in Canada: even now, life is not easy if you are part of a\
  \ minority.\nThe time flew and I carry her to the closer metro station. \nI don't\
  \ rimember the moments right before we kissed: there was not any promise in that\
  \ action but only the willingness to seal the moment.\n\"Maybe one day\" she said,\
  \ going downstairs.\nI didn't know yet that words would have been the beginning\
  \ of a new adventure."
