Text: "Preceding the mandatory acknowledgement of my colourful decision-making, I\
  \ blame the Internet. More specifically, the recruitment board that incited daydreams\
  \ of escapism from my then, drab Customer Service desk (now a boring Admin desk,\
  \ but alas). Wanderlust had reared her ugly -annual- head as routine had delved\
  \ into redundant territory. Life felt mediocre. Though this is a perpetual sentiment\
  \ when stationary, 2015\u2019s miscellaneous life struggles amassed with a vengeance.\
  \ I was done. My geographical knowledge spanned more continents than my passport\
  \ depicted. This irked me (and still does to a lesser extent) which propelled the\
  \ impulsive application for a \u2018Teaching English\u2019 position ANYWHERE I could\
  \ find. Anywhere became Central America. What harm could an email do? I doubted\
  \ I would even receive a response. Until I did. \n\nI was not qualified in the educational\
  \ sense; but my experience in Freelance Writing, performance poetry and the odd\
  \ workshop coordinator position clearly impressed somebody. \nWhat followed was\
  \ an initially apprehensive- turned- pleasant Skype interview. Then a contract.\
  \ It was that simple. This all sounded borderline reckless and reminiscent of a\
  \ quarter life crisis to those around me, until the shock diffused and they remembered\
  \ who I was. The nomadic, worldly, pint- sized, restless spirit- who was about to\
  \ put said attributes to the test.\n\nI had travelled solo since the age of 6. Yes.\
  \ 6, but that is another story. Outside of family trips, most of my adult excursions\
  \ from 2011 to 2018/9 were solitary. Yet this was a country I had never been to/\
  \ had seldom heard of/ without an acquaintance in sight. I handed in my notice at\
  \ my recently obtained, draining job, packed a semi- modest suitcase, borrowed the\
  \ flight money and left. On the premise of a \u2018job offer\u2019, secured accommodation\
  \ and the opportunity to finally commit to learning Espa\xF1ol outside of Youtube\
  \ and online forums. \n\nI arrived in Honduras, after a 14 hour layover in Mexico\
  \ City. I was welcomed by a problematic ATM machine that converted my pounds into\
  \ Mexican pesos instead of US dollars as Honduran Lempira was not worth the conversion.\
  \ The optimistic sentiments were that the country was beautiful; rich in lush greenery,\
  \ endearing, lazy sun rays kissed the skin, the shops were a hub of delectable,\
  \ cultural treats, romantic Espa\xF1ol chatter was airborne and animated public\
  \ transportation rides were commonplace. \n\nThe fine, pessimistic print consisted\
  \ of the following: \n\n1)\tZika had literally flown into existence. That week.\
  \ \n2)\tMy suitcase that gallivanted around the entirety of South AND Central America\
  \ (which, due to laziness and incompetence, would not be in my possession until\
  \ 10 days later!)\n3)\tThe school misled me on the visa procedures and expected\
  \ me to part with my passport as they carried out a border run?! \n4)\tI encountered\
  \ the utmost, vile form of food poisoning- rendering me bedridden for a week! \n\
  5)\tI realized that seasickness is real. \n6)\tMy heritage lulled me into a false\
  \ sense of security- believing that all beaches were made equal. Not that in reality,\
  \ I had to LEAVE the mainland to experience familiar translucent waters. Hence #5.\
  \ \n7)\tLearning the delicate, borderline illicit nature of \u2018accommodation\
  \ in exchange for work\u2019 schemes. \n8)\tUndeclared exit tax- that left an American\
  \ comrade stuck at the infested airport for 72 hours because the illusive tax was\
  \ not included in his exit flight.\n9)\tMy notorious travelling suitcase had been\
  \ mutilated by security- beyond usage- yet they refused to accept responsibility\
  \ or provide a new one. \n\nThis list is NOT exhaustive. \n\nAfter the decision\
  \ to depart from the \u2013 albeit corrupted-  establishment that I travelled for,\
  \ I embarked on almost 60 days of sightseeing, hostel hopping, volunteering, stressing,\
  \ deliberating between Mexico, Colombia and the UK (I settled on the USA) and battling\
  \ endless technological issues.\n\nAt the time, it seemed dishevelled. In recollection,\
  \ I would not have known Baleadas, atole, semitas, Telemundo, solo travel routes\
  \ between neighbouring cities and countries, exit tax, survival skills and my resilience\
  \ even in unsavoury circumstances. I travelled to a new continent, forged friendships,\
  \ escaped Zika, utilized my survival Spanish and have tangible memories, housed\
  \ in a new part of the world. All because I took a leap into the unknown."
