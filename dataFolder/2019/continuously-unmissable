Text: "Oh, Milano!\n\nComing from a nation where thousands of traditions and different\
  \ cultures bring harmony together. So I thought when I will be in Milan it will\
  \ be the same but I forgot the taste of curry and pasta is so different but imagine\
  \ if they cooked together such an unusual taste it can form. \n\nMy journey in Milan\
  \ started with an intended to find the feeling that I am also part of the city but\
  \ sometimes it's not easy wearing a 6-meter long turban and beard, people look at\
  \ you and a lot, you feel nervous when someone comes up to you and say \"Oh, Bellissima\
  \ Turbante\" ( Oh, Beautiful Turban) and that point you know that this city is open\
  \ to all with all heart and mind wherever you go people are so inquisitive to know\
  \ about your life, story, culture and most importantly to share love.\n\nI travelled\
  \ most of the cities in Italy apart from Milan and to make a local connection is\
  \ so easy it all works with a Ciao and smile, from the majestic beauty of Duomo,\
  \ scenic colours of Florence, to the historical Rome and magical nights spend in\
  \ Verona won't be leaving your mind and heart alone but with a strong impression\
  \ to fall in love more deeper as your travel continues. \n\nSince I came here every\
  \ day is a new journey to find myself and capture every single moment finding unusual\
  \ in usual, those brick streets that smells like a rich glass of wine, those pizzerias\
  \ where the sauce is made with not only secret ingredients but with everlasting\
  \ joy to share in every plate with lots of cheese. No matter what happens or I will\
  \ grow older but the passion for travel and the embarking journey will go on and\
  \ never ends until my soul stops to breathe."
