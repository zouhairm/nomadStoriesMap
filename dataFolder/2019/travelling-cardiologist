Text: "Just after my graduation as a cardiologist, I set out on an adventure with\
  \ my sister. We went to Vietnam, a country which have a completely different language\
  \ (and English is not commonly used there), culture and political views. We, or\
  \ me to be exact, were quite paranoid to travel there, unlike going to Singapore\
  \ or Malaysia, countries with similar roots and all, but then again that's exactly\
  \ why we decided to go to Vietnam, to overcome our fear and to better understand\
  \ people or countries that are different than ours. \n\nOne day we went to visit\
  \ Cu Chi Tunnel. We learned about how it was during the war times. The Vietnamese\
  \ used to live and move around through that 250 something kilometers tunnel networks\
  \ during war. The entrance and exit doors were well hidden as to avoid the American\
  \ troops. The rooms and tunnels arranged in three levels. We must say that it was\
  \ quite remarkable considering the lack of technology at that time. The first level\
  \ was 3 meter below the surface and the second and third level was 6 and 10 meters\
  \ underground, respectively. They have kitchen, living rooms, toilets (but don't\
  \ imagine that it was furnished as in the ones we know today, it was war period\
  \ so they only have the essentials).\n\nWe were invited by the guide to try walking\
  \ through the tunnels for 50 meters only (note that those who have claustrophoba,\
  \ asthma, heart disease or pregnant women aren't allowed). My 24 year old sister\
  \ was eager to try, me, the cardiologist, surprisingly was freaked out. Without\
  \ hesitation, my sister went into the tunnel, I was afraid something would happen\
  \ to her, so I went behind her and into the tunnel we walk, nay, we squat-walk inside\
  \ the roughly 1 meter tall and around 70 centimeters wide. It is said that it was\
  \ actually enlarged to accomodate foreign tourists. Originally was way smaller due\
  \ to the petite features of Vietnamese people. Ten meters into the tunnel, it was\
  \ pitch black and my heart was racing. There were a whole line of people squatwalking\
  \ behind me and the architecture of the tunnel didn't allow us to even turn our\
  \ body around. There was no U-turn, no emergency exits, lots of people in a cramped\
  \ space, and my knees were hurting like hell, you can imagine my medical brain started\
  \ to work on all the possible horrific ending to this so called tourist attraction.\
  \ My breathing became faster and shallower, I was having a panic attack, literally,\
  \ and there was no turning back. What got me through that ordeal was only the voice\
  \ of my baby sister, encouraging me to keep moving forward. When we finally reached\
  \ the exits and there was sun and a breath of fresh air, I was so relieved. As I\
  \ look at my sister, I have a whole new found respect of her. She was and still\
  \ is brave and amazing. This adventure to Vietnam made see a different side of her\
  \ that I used to overlook because I am the oldest and used to taking care of her,\
  \ but at that time, she was the one taking care and encouraging me."
