Text: "Amidst the colorful charm of Doolin, in County Clare Ireland, nestled next\
  \ to Gus O\u2019Connor\u2019s Pub where traditional sessions music comes alive every\
  \ night for both locals and tourists alike, stands a nondescript door to a somewhat\
  \ nondescript business - one of those doors that is easily missed when strolling\
  \ charming villages full of trinkets and treasures one seeks out as tokens of visits\
  \ to magical locales. \n\nIt was through this door that I met Gerry Griffin, born\
  \ and raised in Doolin, brother of the banjo player at Gus\u2019s, and by trade\
  \ a tattoo artist and owner of West Coast Body Art.  Housed in a cottage style building\
  \ dating back to the 1800s that sits on the road to the Irish sea, West Coast Body\
  \ Art is spotless.  Gerry will tell you that no matter where you go to get a tat\
  \ you\u2019ve got to look for clean counters, floors and an artist who knows what\
  \ single-use tools means.  He knows that Celtic symbols are his bread and butter,\
  \ so he cheerfully walks you through the history, styles, and shapes of the wistfully\
  \ complex patterns that harbor meanings dating back to 400 and 500 AD.  And though\
  \ the name of Gerry\u2019s place could have easily donned the doorway of a Southern\
  \ California Ink Shop, this was the real deal, Ireland style, and the place I would\
  \ take the leap and get my first tattoo.  The ultimate souvenir.\n\nWhen you are\
  \ three-quarters Irish, with the last name of Dooling, you don\u2019t take your\
  \ first trip to Ireland lightly.  In fact, no one should take their first trip to\
  \ Ireland lightly.  There are stories around every corner and thru every door -\
  \ and certainly, going through Gerry\u2019s door at West Coast Body Art there stories\
  \ to hear if you are willing to ask and willing to listen.  In his musical Irish\
  \ brogue, Gerry shared the history of his town and the history of his work.  His\
  \ steady hands working the whole time, he shared the tale of transformation that\
  \ Doolin had seen as local homeowners discovered the year-round benefits of becoming\
  \ a B&B.  There\u2019s hardly a home in town that doesn\u2019t have a room or two\
  \ for rent, adding to the intimacy of this beautiful spot where folks like Gerry\
  \ have learned the \u201Cart of tourism\u201D as a means to support themselves.\
  \  And though a tattoo parlor isn\u2019t what a typical tourist seeks out during\
  \ a visit, Gerry has \u201Cinked\u201D out a living quite nicely, thank-you-very-much.\
  \  \n\nApprehensive as I was about the whole tattoo experience, having an Irish\
  \ craftsman in a quintessential Irish village was the perfect setting for my first\
  \ (and only)!  No regrets.   On the contrary, every time I see it I\u2019m reminded\
  \ of that trip and everything it meant to me.  I\u2019m reminded of Gerry and the\
  \ other people that made Ireland more than just a place to check off my laundry\
  \ list of destinations not to miss....people who care about where they live and\
  \ what they do and want to share it with you, even though you can only catch about\
  \ every third word when they start to talk fast.\n\nGerry knows his days are numbered\
  \ because steady hands and aging are not a guarantee.  But he\u2019s happy to keep\
  \ doing his thing for as long as he\u2019s confident in providing excellence in\
  \ his craft and for as long as tourists like me are willing to take souvenir shopping\
  \ to the next level."
