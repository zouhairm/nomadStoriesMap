Text: 'I was a first time hiker in Kjerag and Pulpit rock. With no eexperience whatsoever
  and barely 2 stamps on my passport, at 31 I bought my first real sport boots, my
  first real suitcase and lost my hiking virginity in two "strenuous" difficulty chategorized
  mountains. I wasnt alone, though, i was living the dream, going with the -way more
  experienced- love of my life. This is how I fell inlove with Norway every three
  minutes. How I discovered I do need to start with tough challenges, instead with
  smalls. How I took into practice my phylosophy of "when you wanna give up, push
  through three more minutes" and Made it all the way. And how, in norway''s magestic-magical
  way, i reconnected with myself. If there has ever been a place to connect and venerate
  water in all it''s forms: that is Norway. In this trip I faced every fear in my
  book, starting with flying long distances and my money-lackness mentality, to been
  going over my head attempting something so demanding (both my idea, by the way),
  and -of course- falling deeper in love than i already was.

  It all happened, and i not only survived everything, my limits where streched in
  the process. I knew, when he was looking at me while i stood at that peak crying
  in awe and said "You don''t know your own limits. It''s freaking scary. I adore
  it", that i had acomplished more than i could have ever expected. And now, i wanted
  more. But first... The view. Because... Man! Those fjords! They sing'
