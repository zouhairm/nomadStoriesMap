Text: "Every street in the world has a curfew. When doors close, cars stop coming,\
  \ and even the sounds of singing students round the far corner. It\u2019s a cobbled\
  \ apocalypse with a sudden, deep quietness that sends travellers back to their hostel\
  \ to play cards and plan tomorrow. \n\nAnd the thin Spanish street the two of us\
  \ were walking down was no different. All traces of the morning market were gone:\
  \ the blankets strewn with trinkets; the old computer parts and office chair wheels;\
  \ the homemade art; and the hundreds of metal pins for decorating your lapel, aside\
  \ from the Miro-inspired one on mine now. The narrow street seemed almost wide without\
  \ the crowd and stalls as padding. \n\nBut at that time, everything was closed,\
  \ even the kebab place. Like the sandman and boogeyman, my new friend and I strode\
  \ along in sensible shoes, walking in the middle of the deserted street, collars\
  \ high against the cold and seeing only what the moon would show us. We could stride\
  \ with confidence because my friend knew where we were going and all the way the\
  \ flat facades didn\u2019t give way to a single side street. \n\nWe walked together\
  \ down this unending street, talking softly. Suddenly we reached a fork. Left went\
  \ back to the town square. Right would take us past the church on a loop back to\
  \ our hostel and card games. Until the last second I wondered which direction we\u2019\
  d head. My friend stopped at the point of the fork, on the edge of left and right,\
  \ and knocked on a dark door. \n\nSuddenly we were kidnapped from the dark doorway\
  \ into a darker room by a pair of big arms. A door I hadn\u2019t even heard opening\
  \ closed behind us. We were squashed in a waiting room with no lights, no chairs\
  \ and just less space than would have been comfortable for three people, much less\
  \ the large owner of the arms that pulled us from outside. Before our eyes could\
  \ adjust to the dark, the big arms pushed us through a second door into a room filled\
  \ with people, music and low tables. We were there. A secret bar, hidden in plain\
  \ sight in the middle of a deserted street. \n\nWe slid into a table, two of us\
  \ on one side, shoulder-to-shoulder but also shoulder-to-shoulder with our neighbours.\
  \ There was no space but it was so comfortable. We exchanged some cash for squat\
  \ glasses of the only beer on offer. There was no space for theatrics or anything\
  \ more than talking, but that\u2019s perfect for the regular patrons of PhD students,\
  \ local bartenders coming from their late shift, and a few other misfits. No one\
  \ speaks English here.\n\nA conversation later, we were pushed out of the Spanish\
  \ suburban mirage back into the empty street. The door slid shut. It was quiet again\
  \ but music and talking rung in our ears, so we whispered as we made our way back\
  \ along the street. We hurried past bakers getting ready for the day. Church bells\
  \ rang. The patrons dispersed and the curfew was over."
