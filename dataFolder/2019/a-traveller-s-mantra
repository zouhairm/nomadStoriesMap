Text: "\u2018OMMMMMMMMMMMM.\u2019\n\nThe shala vibrated to the chant of twenty aspiring\
  \ yogis.  A French man with a lordotic back and a pot belly sat at the front of\
  \ the room. His legs were crossed and his hands rested in prayer as he spoke.  \n\
  \n\u2018In the practice of yoga we use the mantra OM to reach a heightened state\
  \ of enlightenment.\u2019 \n\nI picked at the seams of my lycra tights, shifting\
  \ weight from my numb sitting bones. The French man was an acclaimed Guru, famous\
  \ throughout the yoga world.  He noticed my fidgeting and proceeded to hover a vibrating\
  \ bowl over my head, instructing me to activate my pelvic chakra and concentrate\
  \ harder. \n\n\u2018A mantra is a spiritually empowered sound,\u2019 he continued.\
  \ 'It may be a syllable, a word or a phrase.\u2019  \n\nIncense swirled in a thick\
  \ fog and made me gag. \n\n\u2018You must find your own personal mantra to guide\
  \ your practice, both on and off the mat.  A mantra to live your life by.\u2019\n\
  \nThe F-word sprang to mind.  Followed by a host of other indecencies. Quite unsuitable\
  \ for a yoga retreat, quite unhealthy to adopt as my life mantra. \n\n\u2018As you\
  \ chant your inner mantra, you open gateways into subconscious spaces.\u2019  His\
  \ voice droned into abstract constructs and I gazed towards the Atlantic ocean,\
  \ through the tinted glass, watching two birds flicker in flight.  \n\nSix hours\
  \ of chanting mantras in a hot room was enough for me.  I excused myself from the\
  \ shala and stepped out into the Moroccan sun. \n\nThe salty breeze was heavenly.\
  \ I laced up my trainers and jogged out the iron gate, making tracks for the ocean.\
  \  I ran along the sand, then over the headland.  Past the local market, pyramids\
  \ of coloured vegetables, squares of spices, rows of carpets.  Past a man selling\
  \ fresh mint tea from an etched silver pot.  I sipped a cup of his sweet liquid\
  \ and watched two hollering boys on horses gallop past.  The sunset turned a dusted\
  \ pink and the ocean quivered into liquid silver.  My heart soared. I did a cartwheel\
  \ of pure joy. Then another, just for good measure. I dusted my sandy hands and\
  \ hummed as I traced my footsteps back to the villa.\n\nIt was nearing 8 PM by the\
  \ time I reached the iron gate and nearing 8.01 PM when I realised it was padlocked.\n\
  \nI rattled the gate. Knocked, banged, called. I circled the tiled walls of the\
  \ villa. No phone, no wallet, no keys. The first night of my first yoga retreat\
  \ and I was locked out.\n\nI was busting to use the toilet, the mint tea was moving\
  \ swiftly. I activated my pelvic chakra and realised that time was of the essence.\
  \ I had seen movies of teenagers scaling balconies and sneaking back to bed unbeknownst\
  \ to slumbering parents.  I wished I had been more rebellious in my youth so to\
  \ prepare for this moment. Never-mind, now was my time.\n\nI found a section of\
  \ the wall with minimal barbed wire. The blue and white Moroccan mosaics were beautiful\
  \ but made climbing precarious. I began to inch myself up.  Tile by tile, I scaled\
  \ the wall.  I twisted sideways through the barbed wire and couldn't help but smile\
  \ at the inner super woman I was channelling.  \n\nDown below, a candlelit dinner\
  \ was underway in the courtyard.  I peered into the scene. A second of serenity,\
  \ before my foot slipped from a loose stone. \n\nIt was 8.25pm when I tumbled down\
  \ that wall.\n\nI landed with a thud and overturned a table of ginger infused water.\
  \  The crunching of carrot abruptly silenced.  Nineteen vegans and a French guru\
  \ stared at my dusty, torn tights. \n\nThere was a long silence before the guru\
  \ spoke.  \n\n\u2018What is the meaning of this strange leap?\u2019\n\nI closed\
  \ my eyes.  Images flashed of crashing waves, thundering hooves, winds of ecstasy.\
  \ My footsteps, the beating of my own drum.\n\nA new F-word came to me, a personal\
  \ mantra one might call it. I crossed my legs, held my hands to prayer, suppressed\
  \ the shakes of laughter and bowed my head in a flash of enlightenment.\n\n\u2018\
  FREEDOMMMMMMMMMMMMM.\u2019"
