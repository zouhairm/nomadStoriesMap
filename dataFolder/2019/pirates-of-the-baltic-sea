Text: "I was on my semester abroad and it was going not so well. Everything was cold\
  \ and frozen in Helsinki and trying to make friends with people that wouldn't accept\
  \ me was treacherous. Then one day, there was a notice going around about an over\
  \ night trip to Sweden. \"Pirates of the Baltic\" it was called. \nI remember taking\
  \ the shuttle bus there with my friend who was so beautiful and posh but also a\
  \ bit out-casted. And there was this cute baby in a stroller that smiled at me.\
  \ I took that as a sign that for once, I'd get to breathe. This was going to be\
  \ the best weekend of my time here.\nWe got on the boat and immediately my perspective\
  \ shifted.\nPicture the titanic without the iceberg- the love boat, as I will refer\
  \ to it. We got to our room and lo and behold, 4 friendly girls that would be our\
  \ weekend best friends, all from different countries and all bright eyed. We linked\
  \ arms and ran to the opening ceremonies, giddy with the prospect of everything\
  \ this weekend could bring. \nThe activities on this cruise ship were endless. \
  \ Karaoke, a nightclub, a sauna and steam room, a water park, you name it. It was\
  \ luxurious and it was OURS. We owned that boat. I saw people from our university\
  \ and lets just say they seemed to be having a lot less fun. I remember we walked\
  \ up to the top of the ship, wind fiercely blowing around us, accompanied by this\
  \ German boy who looked like he belonged in the sound of music. We were giddy off\
  \ champagne and teenage wishes being granted, and everyone was happy. For a few\
  \ moments I forgot about what I'd have to face when I got back.\nWe went to a karaoke\
  \ bar and a speed dating event and there were so many happy faces. It was beyond\
  \ magical.\nThe next morning we toured Stockholm with our new friends and I felt\
  \ so alive. The cold air cut into my cheeks but I rediscovered the beauty of leaving\
  \ new footprints. We took photos and laughed and ate Swedish food. I remembered\
  \ why I wanted to do a semester abroad in the first place.\nThat night it was my\
  \ friends birthday. We bought duty free drinks and rocked with the swaying boat.\
  \ We visited the casino and lost money but who cares. We were young and happy and\
  \ these moment would end so soon. At the night club everyone was wearing their Pirate\
  \ t-shirts and dancing to European EDM. My friends told me it was time for me to\
  \ find a boy, so I did- we kissed under the stars and nearly got knocked down by\
  \ the fierce Nordic winds. He was cute but that's all- sprinkles on top of a sparkly,\
  \ wonderful story. Then I said goodbye to him and relocated my new friends, and\
  \ we happily and miraculously made our way back to our cabin. Then we fell asleep\
  \ to the sway of the boat as we approached the harbor in Helsinki.  \nSaying goodbye\
  \ my shipmates was hard but we got their contact info and vague promises of meeting\
  \ again. It didn't matter. I returned \"home\" to the dormitory with a pep in my\
  \ step. I think everyone noticed the difference in my vibe. I had accomplished what\
  \ I came here for, and I felt hopeful again. And I carried that hope with me for\
  \ the rest of my time there- things started to turn around for me after that weekend.\n\
  To this day that boat doesn't seem real to me: it seemed like some alternate universe\
  \ where things went the right way. Maybe it was a dream. Or maybe, the boat knew\
  \ that for some, just being there was enough- and it decided to add a few firecrackers\
  \ to it."
