Text: "I have taken a plane approximately 187 times in the last four years, I\u2019\
  ve learned another language, and met exceptional friends from all over the world.\
  \ Four years ago, I decided what at the time seemed like the craziest idea. Starting\
  \ College in the US without really knowing English, but also joining the University\
  \ cross country and track team in the State of Alaska. I come from a small town\
  \ of the north of Spain. I lived on the border of France, and after finishing high\
  \ school decided I wanted to break the ice, do something different, literally. If\
  \ you\u2019ve ever felt like it\u2019s time for something new, this is my story\
  \ for you.\n\n1. The Decisive First Portal\nYou crave for chance. You want it, decided\
  \ it, you think about it, you imagine yourself in advance, you can\u2019t stop thinking\
  \ about it, and it can get scary\nas the departure day gets closer. Family, friends,\n\
  teammates, childhood, a thousand goodbyes, and a single\nsuitcase ready to follow\
  \ you to the other side of the globe. I\u2019m sitting in a 10-hour flight with\
  \ just enough time to realize that the adventure is real, and there is no turning\
  \ back.\n\n2. What I Call the Battle Portal\nNew place, new people, new everything,\
  \ over\nexcitement, and hitting a wall. \u201CGreat things never\ncame from comfort\
  \ zone\u201D. Delayed jetlag, language\nbarrier, uncertainty, and culture shock\
  \ hits\nprogressively and inevitably until you make the shift. The\nshift to slowly\
  \ win the battle that later helps you feel\nstronger than you ever thought you\u2019\
  d be. It took me about 2\nmonths to overcome this challenge, and I can surely tell\
  \ you that is\nwas not easy. It\u2019s not easy, but it is possible. And just that,\
  \ makes it worth it already.\n\n#3 Embracing the Fun Portal\nThis is probably the\
  \ best part of taking risks, it\u2019s the satisfactory recompense. It\u2019s the\
  \ feeling of having your foot in the door and starting to control the situation.\
  \ It\ninvolves growing away from home when you\u2019re still a teenager, and finding\
  \ yourself. Yes, sounds easier than what it is. One thing I want to share is what\
  \ my\nmother told me every time I felt defeated by my\nactions. She would always\
  \ bring up \u201CIf plan A fails remember there are 25 more letters\u201D. This\
  \ has helped\nme get through a lot, but mostly to never quit. You\nmust always prioritize\
  \ confidence and positivity\nbefore taking any risks. It makes the adventure more\
  \ enjoyable, and it\u2019s my secret to have fun.\n\n#4 An Enriching Opportunity\n\
  This portal is the perfect occasion to take a step back and\nappreciate how far\
  \ you\u2019ve gone. I like to call it the opportunity to\nremind myself of the privilege\
  \ I\u2019ve been given. They say, time flies when you\u2019re having fun... True\
  \ enough, as a risk taker it\u2019s hard sometimes to embrace every moment when\
  \ you keep thinking ahead. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to travel more than 40\
  \ times a year, compete in the sport I am passionate about, and advance my education\
  \ all at the same time. Your opportunity may be different, you may have others chances\
  \ but that\u2019s the exciting part of making your unique story. What you should\
  \ take from this stage, is to learn how to see things differently. Every day can\
  \ be an opportunity; it\u2019s only about how you decide to see it.\n  \n#5 The\
  \ Bright Open Portal\nGraduation, adulthood, wanderlust, and new horizons. This\
  \ is my current stage of my experience in Alaska. I like to\ncall it the open door\
  \ since it\u2019s the time to look for the\nnext chapter. It\u2019s the time to\
  \ move on, change\ndirections and decide on another adventure. \u201CLife is either\
  \ a daring adventure or nothing at all\u201D said Hellen Keller at the end of a\
  \ book. My goal, is to encourage you to challenge limitations, redirecting when\
  \ necessary, and always strive for better. At the end, we only regret the chances\
  \ we didn\u2019t take.\n\nDo it with passion, compassion, humor, and some style."
