Text: "I thought I had it all figured out about this trip. The tickets, the accommodation,\
  \ the sights, the weather and the food. Who would have thought that a small city\
  \ in the north of Spain would have so much more to offer?\n\nI decided to take four\
  \ days off and travel to Bilbao with my sister last summer. It is a small but busy\
  \ city with industrial and cultural development.  I had everything planned out.\
  \ We were staying in a small hotel downtown so that we could enjoy walking to all\
  \ the main sights. \n\nOn our first day we decided to explore the centre.We walked\
  \ along the main streets, asking passersby about locals' favourites. I was surprised\
  \ by their dedication to help. They told us that Bilbao is a walkable city from\
  \ side to side and we could explore it in a few days. Indeed, we enjoyed walking\
  \ around some beautiful squares, the most memorable of them being the Moyua square\
  \ with colourful flower patterns and surrounding neoclassic buildings. We got a\
  \ hint about a local cafe and some incredible panaderias(pastry shops) where we\
  \ enjoyed freshly made bread and local delicacies, like the goxua, something like\
  \ a Basque version of the creme brulee. We ended up spending the evening in the\
  \ Guggenheim museum where we admired modern art from local, European and American\
  \ artists. \n\nThe next day we crossed the bridge of San Anton and explored the\
  \ Casco Viejo, the Old Quarter as it is called. With its cobble-stoned streets and\
  \ its picturesque domes and little shops, the area is a wonderful gem in an otherwise\
  \ modernized city. Inside this beautiful small quarter we enjoyed shrimp, ham and\
  \ salmon pitxos-the Basque version of the Spanish tapas-paired with local wine.\
  \ Wines have a unique taste here, they carry a little bit of the fruitiness of the\
  \ mild coastal climate but also the intensity of the harsh winters. The white wine\
  \ Txakoli is a must-try, combining the minerality of the sea and the lightness of\
  \ its year-old existence. Leaving the Casco Viejo, we went over to the Abando train\
  \ station where the emblematic stained glass wall depicts the basilica of Begona\
  \ and other typical Biscayan symbols. \n\nThe third day of our trip was dedicated\
  \ to the Irala neighbourhood and its surroundings. It is an area next to the centre\
  \ where colourful houses are matched with graffiti works of street artists and long,\
  \ pedestrian streets. It is a marvel of architecture built for the workers of the\
  \ flour and bread company Harino Panadera at the beginning of the 20th century.\
  \ We were lucky enough to meet a local who is a history expert of the area and he\
  \ told us all about it.  We then went on to enjoy local yogurt with honey at a local\
  \ cafe. The yogurt was from an area outside Bilbao and it was fresh, taken straight\
  \ from the bucket that it was brought in. I could really taste the milk and its\
  \ creamy texture created an unforgettable memory. \n\nBilbao is definitely one of\
  \ the few places I visited that has surpassed my expectations for many reasons.\
  \ Although I was in a city, it suddenly felt like I was travelling in a small village,\
  \ tasting local delicacies and talking to locals feeling as if I had known them\
  \ forever. Their hospitality and friendliness made the experience an easy and pleasurable\
  \ exploration of the landscape, adding cultural shades and history notes. It is\
  \ a city that combines the industrial with the rural, business with culture, the\
  \ old and the new in one colourful painting."
