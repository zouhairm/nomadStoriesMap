Text: "Last year, around this time, I embarked on a unique experience as an international\
  \ intern in Spain. I have been an international nomad, but I had only lived in English\
  \ speaking countries like UK, USA and hong kong. Moving to a country, albeit temporarily,\
  \ where I did not know the first language was truly daunting. \nThankfully I had\
  \ made friends from Spain and other Latin countries who kept me motivated and taught\
  \ me a \u2018word\u2019 of the day in Spanish. They made adjusting to the new environment,\
  \ language and people that much easier. \nGetting to live in Madrid, taking travel\
  \ tips from the locals, eating where they might, and by the end ordering in Spanish\
  \ was a surreal experience. Getting to know a culture that intimately, celebrating\
  \ with them during the many festivals, and mourning with them on good Friday, or\
  \ even learning how Arabic words took root in both Spanish and hindi was truly a\
  \ treasure! \nOne of the perks of having a best friend from Spain was visiting her\
  \ family in san Sebastian over Easter! Her grandma had cooked us our favourite tapas\
  \ and some new traditional basque dishes, which were a first for me. The delicious\
  \ meal, the lovely conversation (with the help of my friends who were consciously\
  \ translating the jokes and their punch lines ;)), and the post lunch Cointreau\
  \ leaves something more to be desired. In India too, at family lunches during festivals\
  \ and wedding gatherings, include much lazing around, languid conversations and\
  \ Indian choice beverage of most afternoons: chai. Our cultures went through different\
  \ evolutions, we don\u2019t share a lot in common, except that we are all humans.\
  \ \n\nInteracting closely with different cultures and languages is like getting\
  \ a rare insight into human history. Whether through learning the language, trying\
  \ out the local food, seeking out places of historic importance to the local community,\
  \ or seeing the social concerns according to local artists. \n\nI have always struggled\
  \ at expressing my vast international experience, in the fear that I may corrupt\
  \ it somehow or not adequately deliver justice to the moment and the memory. I believe\
  \ this travel writing scholarship will help me in understanding how to communicate\
  \ my travel story better."
