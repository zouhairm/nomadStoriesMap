Text: "Constant  inplugs of   Tribal life, their  religion, culture, food habits and\
  \ so on. Maybe for  this very  reason when I started  seriously thinking about the\
  \ place to travel  I could\u2019nt  think of  a better place than  to north east\
  \  India. The tribal life,  north east  India  both being so vast subjects I  zero\
  \ down  my  research area  to Ziro.  Ziro is a beautiful village in the lower subansiri\
  \ district of Arunachal Pradesh.\n                              Arunachal Pradesh,\
  \ called as a land of rising sun, is a home of 26 major tribes and more than 110\
  \ sub tribes. I decided to focus on two tribes Apatanis and Nyishis. I was fortunate\
  \ enough to observe their way of   life closely. What  intric  me the most was their\
  \ tribal religion. Through the interviews and  their  whole  hearted  acceptance\
  \ in their families, festivals, etc.  I started to know about their tribal religion\
  \ known as doni poloism.\n                                Doni poloism is a combination\
  \ of two words, doni   means the sun and  polo means the moon. So, essentially these\
  \ tribes pray to sun and moon as their God. Worship of sun and moon is quite common\
  \ in many cultures, but the unique thing of donipoloism is that  they consider \
  \ the Sun as  the female god. They believe that the entire creation is born out\
  \ of her, she is the source of everything and therefore they refer to her as Anne\
  \ doni or  mother sun. The moon is the father god and he's believed to be the guardian\
  \ of time. Just like all outsiders  I initially thought  these  tribes  pray to\
  \ the sun and moon visible in the sky. It was quite later  that  I realised  the\
  \ true meaning of the word  Donipolo. They are referring to something more abstract,\
  \ over above and beyond the sun and moon. They talk about an abstract concept of\
  \ god who is formless, omnipotent, omnipresence and is everywhere. It is difficult\
  \  to  believe that  such a concept of  God can  actually be there. That's the reason\
  \ why we as outsiders fail to comprehend it and label them as nature worshipers.\
  \ This belief that God is everywhere can be seen everywhere in their social lives.\
  \ I went to almost all the Apatani and Nishi  house but in none of the houses I\
  \ could find any image, any ideal of  donipolo. Even in their common community areas\
  \ there was no place specially assigned for the worship of donipolo. When I asked\
  \ them the reason for it they told me that they truly believe God is everywhere.\
  \ Donipolo is in me, Donipolo is in you and she is there in every creation and so\
  \ they don't feel any need of restricting her to a temple. Therefore, they do not\
  \ have temples. Isn't that quite deep? Isn't that something major world religions\
  \ also not been able to understand? I had slowly started realising under the seemingly\
  \ simple ideas of   these  tribals  there lies profound philosophical principles.\
  \ These moral concepts aren't given by god. It has been the wisdom of their forefathers\
  \ which have been guiding their ethical conduct.\n                      Their moral\
  \ behaviour is governed by their own thought processes, their own reflections on\
  \ life where they regard harmonious relations with each other as the highest value.\
  \ They regard harmonious relations with nature around as equally important value.\
  \ Human beings do not hold any superior position compared to any other creations.\
  \  Infact  we  have been entrusted with the responsibility of taking care, nurturing\
  \ and loving the environment. Due to this approach to environment Nishi and Apatani\
  \  people have been able to  mantain ecological balance beautifully.  Ziro is lush\
  \ green with   paddy  fields all over. Apatani people have mastared the skill of\
  \  paddy  cultivation. They do it without the use of any machinery, any chemicals\
  \ or  pesticides  Hence, they can also grow fish into that water. Every house there\
  \  has a kitchen garden where they grow vegetables for their daily use. Every waste\
  \  material from the  house  goes to the  garden. Maximum utilization of the resources\
  \ is the mantra for their sustainable development model. Unesco has nominated ziro\
  \ valley as world  heritage site. \n                   It is our unawareness of\
  \ philosophical principles that are responsible for labelling tribes as nature worshipers,\
  \ backwardness  and so on. We need to change our  mainstream stereotypical way of\
  \  looking at them. If we  remove these glasses of superiority and try to look at\
  \ the tribals objectively we would realize that they also  have certain things to\
  \ contribute to the society. We always perceives ourselves as the giving end and\
  \  tribals  at the receiving end. If we really want to bridge this gap between us\
  \ and them and want to integrate them we need to keep an open eye. An  open  minded\
  \ enquiry into their lives to realize that they also have few things to offer to\
  \ the outside world."
