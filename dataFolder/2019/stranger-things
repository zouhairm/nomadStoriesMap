Text: "STRANGER THINGS\nUntil I moved to Azerbaijan I never realized some things common\
  \ in Argentina were not so common in other countries. For instance, mate  a traditional\
  \ beverage in Argentina is considered extremely rare for many people outside South\
  \ America. \nWhen I talk about strange I embrace the definition that refers to \u201C\
  a person or thing with whom/which one is not familiar\u201D, even when today I cannot\
  \ claim to be a specialist on Azerbaijan, its culture and people. \nLife is lived\
  \ in different forms through language, cultures, and beliefs, and makes absolute\
  \ sense to those who practice it. So, the first time I arrived in the country they\
  \ were, for sure, completely strange to me; I had never been there, never seen it\
  \ nor tasted it. I discovered all sort of unfamiliar, new and previously unknown\
  \ things. I must confess some were bizarre and unexpected that it made me freak-out\
  \ and annoyed while others got me curious, were out of the ordinary and surreal,\
  \ yes a mix feeling indeed! I accepted the challenge and made my own version of\
  \ an amusement park of life. \n\nI FOUND STRANGE\nNo Bidet: Let\u2019s keep it straight;\
  \ in Argentina most bathrooms have bidet, a basin near the toilet that is used to\
  \ clean, you know, your things, after using the toilet, or whenever a freshening\
  \ up is needed (hehe). I found no bidet in any of the houses I visited in Azerbaijan\
  \ including my own, which was unusual to me however, according to Richard this is\
  \ normal because there is no such thing in Ghana as well, poor African! Our long\
  \ deliberation on Skype was summarized by a proof with a picture of my bathroom\
  \ including the bidet. Call me antique but I think a bidet is not a possession but\
  \ a right! Moreover, how do people without bidets in the bathroom live? \n\nWhere\
  \ did the electrical switches go? Honestly, my experience with the location of electrical\
  \ switches is mostly in Latin America and specifically Argentina, so I cannot generalize.\
  \ In Azerbaijan, I realized while in Argentina the light switches to the bathroom\
  \ were inside, that of Azerbaijan were outside. And yes, your guess is as good as\
  \ mine! I could enter the bathroom before I realized the switch is outside, had\
  \ to come out to switch the light on. Per Richard\u2019s experience, it can be both\
  \ ways in Ghana, often depending on the location of the bathroom. For instance,\
  \ if the bathroom is in the house the switch can be either outside or inside the\
  \ bathroom while bathrooms outside the house mostly have outside switches. Apparently,\
  \ it doesn\u2019t really matter to Ghanaians where the switch is as long as they\
  \ can find it. Oh yes you can laugh! I found it amusing yet I admit it is convenient\
  \ to have a switch outside, to have the light on before you enter than to enter\
  \ the dark before you can switch on the light.\n\nHigh Heels: Women in Baku are\
  \ commonly coquette and I confirmed such statement during my first winter in the\
  \ country. Winter in Azerbaijan varies in each region and in Baku it is supposed\
  \ not to be very harsh. However, I remember my first winter in Azerbaijan when snow\
  \ came between December and January. I was amazed to see some women wearing high\
  \ heels and walking on the snow with such ability and certainty, like I will do\
  \ in summer, yet I could hardly manage to stand properly on my feet in my sneakers.\
  \ \n\nI guess I could tell more stories about the time I spent in that country.\
  \ I kind of miss exploring what surrounds me however I still do it but now within\
  \ my own country and not only when I am abroad. I constantly say to my friends that\
  \ my life in Azerbaijan was really good for two main reasons; first, I did not expect\
  \ same lifestyle I had back home and yes I experienced a new one, and second, I\
  \ took the out of ordinary as a stimulus to trigger my curiosity for my new experience."
