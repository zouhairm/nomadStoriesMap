Text: "Moalboal is known for: Sardine run, Turtles and Oslob, where, for 45\u20AC\
  \ you can enjoy invading the habitat of whale sharks, surrounded by thirsty Instagramers.\
  \ It had been three days looking and still I hadn\u2019t seen turtles, but I wasn't\
  \ accepting failure. I already knew Moalboal's shore as my hometown\u2019s. The\
  \ narrow pavements to the shore where turtles chill among yellow anemones and long\
  \ lost flip flops and bottles from irresponsible tourists was no secret to me. I\
  \ was just focused on not being the only European without my turtle selfie. First\
  \ day I was positive it would take 30 minutes and then I could enjoy a mango shake\
  \ in Chilli bar, a beach nightclub founded by a now deceased Swedish dreamer whose\
  \ picture presides the place.\n\nI stopped to rent a snorkel mask. The kid wasn't\
  \ older than 25, but his hands and feet were black and wrinkled due to the spicy\
  \ sun as a 60 year old sailor's. His smile was wide but also way too short for being\
  \ an honest one. \n\n-Morning ma'am  \n-Snorkel, please\n-For sardines- he pointed\
  \ The Chilli Bar with his black index- for turtles- he pointed towards what looked\
  \ achievable but ended up being the most frustrating quest during my SEAsia adventure.\n\
  \nI tried. But nothing. No turtles. Just coral reefs which colors were so near that\
  \ I could feel them in my stomach. Green fishes going through my hair and a tiny\
  \ jellyfish. It's funny how moving babies are, despite the species, at least until\
  \ you realize they can hurt you. The pink baby jellyfish crossed my face with its\
  \ tentacles and I felt my cheek burning. Gave up and got out. Back in the shop,\
  \ the guy could not help himself laughing when he saw me all swollen.\n\n-Saw the\
  \ turtles ma'am?- I didn\u2019t answer, I couldn\u2019t move my face.\n\n-Maybe\
  \ tomorrow- maybe tomorrow is the solution Filipinos give to deceived tourists.\n\
  \nWhen my face was almost back to normal thanks to antibiotics I put together 100PHP\
  \ and walked to the usual spot. \n\n-Today your lucky day ma'am- as naive as it\
  \ sounds, I believed him.\n\nThat second day I didn't find the turtles either, but\
  \ I had a laugh. I was trying my best to find the animals and suddenly I heard 'taky\
  \ taky!\u2019. This kid was singing and dancing, standing over a roof. \u2018Taky\
  \ taky rumba!\u2019 I replied back, continuing the lyrics. He shaked his hair dancing,\
  \ I copied his movements a while and, again, gave up any hope. \n\n-Next day you\
  \ get discount ma'am\n-It's my third day\n\nHe laughed and gave me the snorkel.\
  \ Hopes of finding turtles were low, but existent. I didn\u2019t pay attention to\
  \ the dotted starfishes nor to the shiny fishes, they seemed like family already.\
  \ I stayed a while looking at an old sunk anchor, full of vegetation and sealife.\
  \ It totally activated my imagination and my childhood mermaid obsession. Maybe\
  \ it was from a Spanish ancient boat? Just from a tour boat? Still a breathtaking\
  \ sight for a city girl. \n\nI dodged the jellyfishes and the sharp corals. No sign\
  \ of turtles. The sea was shaky and cold. Didn\u2019t want to surrender, but I felt\
  \ defeated. While thinking about an excuse to justify that failure I felt something\
  \ tenderly touching my feet. Not very big, but definitely not a baby. A green turtle,\
  \ with yellow stripes all over its calm head, eating seaweed, like it had been pacefully\
  \ waiting for me the last three days. I took my GoPro as fast as possible, trying\
  \ to get the best selfie with the animal, giving me his back. Didn't I look stupid...\
  \ trying to get proof of my experience instead of enjoying it. Left the camera and\
  \ hold my breath. When he was fed and happy, he gracefully swam away. And this,\
  \ my story, is way more powerful than any selfie I could've taken. \n\n-Saw turtles\
  \ ma'am?\n-Yes!- I started telling him about it like a 5 year old talking about\
  \ Christmas\n\n-If you want I take you try ballot and bulalo, local Filipino ma'am\n\
  \nI had tried both before, but still felt like telling him about the turtle, so\
  \ I said yes."
