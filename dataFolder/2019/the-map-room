Text: "The smoke in the air is dense, unbreathable actually.  The sound of airplane\
  \ engines coming from the direction of the Thames has been ever increasing and is\
  \ now incessant.  An air raid siren pierces through the lingering morning fog still\
  \ covering the city.  People run frantically seeking refuge, anywhere, and as quickly\
  \ as they can.  A converted basement under the New Public Offices Building and ten\
  \ feet below the ground is where the British government has been relocated.  It\
  \ is here between the British Parliament and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office at\
  \ 10 Downing Street that Churchill is now conducting the war underground.  The halls\
  \ of this mazelike series of rooms are filled with cigar smoke, telephones ringing\
  \ incessantly, and a kind of organized chaos.  Most Britons have no idea that this\
  \ secret place exists.  Those who work here have been sworn to secrecy about its\
  \ presence.  The government would continue to run from this hidden underground location\
  \ in the heart of London throughout the duration of the war while incendiary bombs\
  \ were dropped by the Axis Powers on the city.  It was also here in the War Cabinet\
  \ Rooms that Churchill stated, \u201CThis is the room from which I will direct the\
  \ war.\u201D\n\nIt is now over seventy years later. I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ a highly restricted series of rooms under Whitehall from which Churchill had secretly\
  \ led World War II as Prime Minister with his closest associates.   I came to London\
  \ to study for the summer, but now found myself walking through these same narrow,\
  \ maze like, and once top-secret hallways.  Everything had been left as it was during\
  \ the war.  The white brick walls, the red reinforced girders to protect the installation\
  \ from bombs, the papers, books, and phones on the table.  It is still the Nineteen\
  \ Forties here under London and there is still a war raging outside.\n\nI walked\
  \ to a large, securely bolted wooden door with the number \u201CSixty-Five\u201D\
  \ painted in white in the top central position.  Today it is unlocked.  This was\
  \ the Map Room and attached to it the Map Room Annex, which was the center of war\
  \ time strategy.  A large map still remains on the wall and retains the holes from\
  \ pins used to mark the progress of convoys.    There is a piece of paper still\
  \ affixed to the door of the Map Room Annex that contains a royal seal at the top\
  \ followed by a list of names enumerating the select few permitted to enter this\
  \ most secret of secret rooms in the underground installation.\n\n\nI didn\u2019\
  t expect to find that not even everyone who was privy to the knowledge that this\
  \ secret government headquarters existed, or even all those who worked here daily,\
  \ were able to enter into the Map Room.  The select individuals on the list ranged\
  \ from a few members of the War Cabinet to the Prime Minister\u2019s Staff to the\
  \ High Commission, but it was severely limited and the names from each department\
  \ were few and carefully chosen.\n\nIt made me realize that sometimes only our closest\
  \ family members and friends can join us in working toward the goals that we have\
  \ for our own lives.  Those who come into our own metaphorical Map Room have to\
  \ be our most trusted of advisors.  Sometimes our dreams can only be effectively\
  \ achieved through working out of sight, or metaphorically ten feet below the ground,\
  \ with the help of only our closest allies.  I didn\u2019t expect to find that my\
  \ own struggles with achieving certain goals in life would connect with events that\
  \ took place in the highly restricted underground Map Room in London some seventy\
  \ years before I would arrive here.  Even those with whom we work every day may\
  \ not necessarily be those who are best suited to help or advise us with our closest\
  \ dreams and goals.  I didn\u2019t expect that a top-secret military installation\
  \ from the past in London would have a lesson to teach me about achieving success\
  \ or your goals some seventy years later after those rooms had been used as a headquarters\
  \ for securing victory during World War II."
