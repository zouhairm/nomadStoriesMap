Text: "The valley is a patchwork of rusty browns, faded greens and dirty yellows.\
  \ Visitors mill around while gigantic birds soar through a perfect blue sky. My\
  \ smile beams out from a ruddy red face. This is Colca Canyon in Peru and the photos\
  \ show it all. Some might say it\u2019s the stuff of Instagram dreams. \n\nThere\
  \ is another story behind the images. Of course, the harsh landscape around me is\
  \ awe-inspiring. It\u2019s a place where you would hate to live but that you could\
  \ only dream of visiting. However, the cold truth is my hands are numb and the frigid\
  \ air is stinging the skin on my face. All the time, I keep thinking of the Argentinian\
  \ at the hotel in Arequipa who sold me this tour. \n\nFor a brief moment, forgetting\
  \ my misery, I go out towards the edge of the precipice. The drop is rocky, vertiginous\
  \ and just spectacular. A wispy haze only enhances the views.  Then, I pull back\
  \ as a young Peruvian couple wielding a selfie stick join me. I watch them climb\
  \ right out to the edge, ignoring the big warning sign telling people not to do\
  \ this. Welcome to travel in the 21st-Century!\n\nAs I wander around, I try to take\
  \ photos of the condors. Sometimes, these enormous birds appear almost like specks\
  \ in the distance before climbing on the warm thermal currents of the valley and\
  \ eventually swooping in over our heads. It\u2019s indeed a sight to savour. However,\
  \ as I\u2019m only wearing a t-shirt and a light top, I almost feel tempted to catch\
  \ one of those thermal currents myself. Honestly, I feel as if I\u2019m turning\
  \ into a human ice block. In my mind, I bitterly repeat the final words of the Argentinian\
  \ as I recall a perishing Christmas I\u2019d spent in China years before. At least,\
  \ I\u2019d been warmer there. \n\nAll things, for better or for worse, must come\
  \ to an end. So it is with our visit to see the condors. The guide calls us and,\
  \ after a short delay while he rounds up the group, we set off. We\u2019ve had an\
  \ early start, so the atmosphere on the bus is uncharacteristically quiet.  \n\n\
  Making a brief stop in Maca, a small but engaging Andean community, a thirty-something\
  \ Taiwanese-Canadian woman from our group marches over to me. We had bonded over\
  \ breakfast as she, her seventeen-year-old son, and I had passed around the flask\
  \ of hot water to warm our hands. \n\n\u2018I was never as cold as in that hotel,\u2019\
  \ she announces indignantly. \n\u2018There\u2019s an Irish novel called Breakfast\
  \ on Pluto, but I\u2019m sure we were much colder,\u2019 I reply. \n\u2018I\u2019\
  m going to complain when we get back to Arequipa.\u2019\n\nNoting the determination\
  \ in her voice, I wonder what I can possibly say to the Argentinian back at the\
  \ hotel. Soon, these thoughts leave my mind as I explore the local church. It\u2019\
  s yet another surprise- a monument to syncretism where the statues of the saints\
  \ wear wide-brimmed hats and dresses in traditional Andean colours and patterns.\
  \ \n\nLater in the day, however, thoughts of the Argentinian return when I start\
  \ to sneeze uncontrollably. Like the brutal cold of Colca Canyon, almost nothing\
  \ on this trip to Peru will be like anything I expected to find. In my worst nightmares,\
  \ I don't imagine the bus journey that will see me seriously sick but stranded overnight\
  \ in the high Andes. Nor do I anticipate the raging fevers or the sinus passages\
  \ that will almost need a plumber instead of a doctor. Adding insult to injury,\
  \ my breathing in Cusco will become surprisingly akin to the labours of Hercules.\
  \ But I have no inkling of any of these things. Instead, at the point when I start\
  \ to feel unwell, I\u2019ll only think once more of the Argentinian\u2019s final\
  \ words to me when I paid for the trip. \n\n'Make sure to bring warm clothing; it\
  \ gets cold up there,\u2019 he said. \nFor one fleeting moment during this trip,\
  \ I might have expected the unexpected."
