Text: "She leaped high into the air, the tassels on her hat floating like prayer flags,\
  \ her smile as bright as the snow capped peaks behind her. \"Did you get the picture?\"\
  \ she demanded, landing firmly back on earth and striding over to see the evidence.\
  \ \nBefore having children a colleague had informed me, in no uncertain terms, that\
  \ children and travelling do not mix. He was the old school type, prone to telling,\
  \ rather than discussing, and my protestations were met with utter rejection. Children.\
  \ Cannot. Travel. \nBut here. 6 and 3 year olds, bounding over Poon Hill, as the\
  \ sun rise spilled jaggedly over the soaring peaks of Gangapurna Mountain, Annapurna\
  \ South Mountain, Annapurna mountain, Dhaulagiri Mountain, Hiunchuli Mountain, mountain\
  \ names jumbling in our throats as those mesmerizing peaks soared around us. \n\
  Awaking from their tangled dreams little over an hour before, they had marched solidly\
  \  up the hill in the dark, remarking on the adventure, the experience of walking\
  \ in the dark, the patterns their torch light made as it danced over the rocks we\
  \ stumbled over, daring each other to run, race the sun, get to the top first! Their\
  \ thoughts focused entirely on the vast experience of the present moment, I again\
  \ marveled at their ability to turn every little experience, even those mundane\
  \ to the adults around them, into an experience requiring the deep thought, intense\
  \ logic, and unparalleled imagination that only children can bring. That bug, why\
  \ is he that colour? That bush looks like a rabbit. Have you seem that tiny shrine,\
  \ nestled against a house like a baby to it's mother? Children, it turns out, travel\
  \ more in the moment, take more enrichment, more joy from every aspect of travel,\
  \ than any adult is capable of. \nAnd now. My daughter. She reaches the summit in\
  \ one final flurry. Her flushed face turns up towards the panorama around her. Her\
  \ breath is taken away in an instant, she spirals on the spot, her hands spread\
  \ outwards, upwards, her eyes drinking in every aspect, her breath found as she\
  \ gasps: \n\"The world mummy! Look. It's so beautiful\"."
