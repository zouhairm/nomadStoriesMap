Text: "3 years ago I got a great opportunity to travel. When I was 16, I had decided\
  \ go to Vienna \u2013 one of the most expensive and beautiful cities in the Europe.\
  \ Me and my two friends just bought tickets and leaped into the unknown with bus\
  \ \xABWarsaw - Vienna\xBB.  By the end of the road, we have understood, that it\
  \ really happens! We are going to find a new world, and this world is opening for\
  \ us right now! But what`s next? We were children and had no idea what to consider\
  \ before the trip (for example, hostel reservation). But we knew one thing: we want\
  \ to get away from the daily routine and see something new.\nSo, we had been staying\
  \ in front of the Railway Station at 6 AM completely elated and perplexed at the\
  \ same time. Then we bought 24 hour passes and went to metro. The first attraction\
  \ I saw was the Church of St. Karl, it was huge, beautiful and pompous, with all\
  \ figures of angels and domes, then I still didn`t know that for the next two days\
  \ I would admire at every step. Every house in Vienna can be seen for hours. Walking\
  \ through the cozy narrow streets, I looked up and was speechless: the largest cathedral\
  \ I had ever seen towered right above us - St. Stephen's Cathedral. On Stephen`s\
  \ Square we walked around the souvenir shops and bought Viennese coffee \u2013 how\
  \ sweet it smells! After going through a couple of streets, we found Albertina -\
  \ an art gallery, and decided to go there. Tickets are expensive, pictures are specific,\
  \ not everyone will like it. Then we had seen Hoffburg - a huge palace, where now\
  \ you can also see the library, the museum of butterflies and much more.\nFinally,\
  \ at five o'clock in the evening, we decided to look for an overnight stay. But,\
  \ by coincidence, stumbled upon the House of the Sea and could not resist. It was\
  \ worth it! Sharks, stingrays, fish had been swimming overhead, in the greenhouse\
  \ we could see lemurs, lizards and many, many other wonderful animals. We went to\
  \ the observation platform and seeing the panorama,  I realized that Vienna, with\
  \ its tiny streets is very similar to the city of my dreams. \nAt 8 pm we got lost.\
  \ Finally and irrevocably. I still do not understand how it was possible to get\
  \ lost in the city center. We were terribly tired, but proud of  understanding that\
  \ we managed to make our first big adventure. While we were wandering around the\
  \ majestic Hoffburg, we found a skating rink, which seemed to have just been pulled\
  \ out of a fairy tale. Couples, hand in hand, waltzed to the beat of magical music\
  \ of Strauss, and behind them was the palace, it was easy to assume that he belonged\
  \ to one of the Disney princesses.\nInspired by the beautiful, we still found a\
  \ hostel nearby, and realized that nothing is impossible if there is a good mood\
  \ and thirst for adventure. Finally, at 12 at night, we fell asleep, our legs hurt,\
  \ but the soul was happy.\nAnd in the morning we again leaped into the unknown:\
  \ full of confidence that life is a wonderful thing."
