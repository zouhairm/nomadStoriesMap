Text: "I started my journey via bus from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh in Cambodia\
  \ and planned to return to Vietnam after a few days of exploring this city. \nI\
  \ booked my bus ticket on a site called camboticket which sells tickets for bus\
  \ companies such as SAPACO who I ended up traveling with. After reading a few reviews,\
  \ I thought this company sounded like one of the more reliable options. The office\
  \ from which the bus picks you up was also close to the hostel I was staying in:\
  \ Lee Hostel. To cross from Vietnam to Cambodia you will need to bring a passport\
  \ picture and 30USD to give to the boarder crossing guards at the land border. This\
  \ will get you a visa to enter Cambodia but make sure that you have another visa\
  \ to re-enter Vietnam if you are planning on returning afterwards. Of course, this\
  \ will depend on your own visa requirements but as a British citizen, my 15 days\
  \ of visa free travel in Vietnam didn\u2019t include multiple re-entry.  \nYou can\
  \ ask the bus driver to drop you in the centre or closer to your accommodation if\
  \ its on the way. I got dropped a 20-minute walk away from my next hostel which\
  \ was called Lovely Jubbly Villa Hostel. This is one of the nicest hostels I have\
  \ stayed at, as well as one of the cheapest. A bed in a dorm room can be as little\
  \ as \xA34 per night. The hostel is full of friendly, smiley staff who always say\
  \ hello and are eager to help you with anything. There\u2019s also a great bar with\
  \ cheap breakfasts and cocktails for as little as \xA32. \nDuring my time in Phnom\
  \ Penh, I managed to visit the Khmer Rouge Killing Fields just outside of the city\
  \ which is a harrowing experience. To get here, you will need to ask for a tuk tuk\
  \ driver, which your accommodation will usually be happy to organise. The Lovely\
  \ Jubbly Hostel organise tours to different places in the city as well as helping\
  \ you with transport if you just want to go somewhere specific. Once you arrive\
  \ at the fields you will be offered an audio tour which provides all the information\
  \ about the site as well as beautifully told stories from victims and people affected\
  \ by the tragic history that permeates the country. \nIf you want to know more about\
  \ the history of mass genocide which plagues this country, you can also visit the\
  \ Genocide Museum within Phnom Penh. Again, you will be given an audio tour with\
  \ information and personal stories which will stay with you long after your visit.\
  \ I found this museum just as interesting as the killing fields and it was much\
  \ easier to reach as it was within walking distance of my accommodation. \nAside\
  \ from its intense history, Cambodia is a country which exudes positivity and happiness\
  \ amongst the most difficult circumstances. Although you have to be aware of the\
  \ poverty and the danger of walking alone in these streets, the friendliness of\
  \ the locals is a stark contrast to the warnings that I was given by hostel staff\
  \ and moto drivers to be wary. Walking back to my hostel I stopped to grab some\
  \ street food and the street vendors were nothing but welcoming and eager to explain\
  \ all about their local delicacies. As well as street food, there are many trendy\
  \ restaurants around the city where you can have a dine out experience for cheap.\
  \ \nSimilar to Ho Chi Minh, Phnom Penh is dotted with different temples or Wats\
  \ with unique styles. I visited Wat Phnom which is surrounded by a beautiful garden\
  \ where I met another local who was ecstatic when I paid 1USD for some tiger balm\
  \ she sold from her art and crafts shop. The Wat itself is often surrounded by monkeys\
  \ waiting to be fed by visitors. \nOverall, the atmosphere and the positivity that\
  \ emanates from a country with a past like Cambodia\u2019s, makes it well worth\
  \ a visit."
