Text: "Being a literature student, I always wanted to encounter and experience  the\
  \ beauty and adventurous fervour of nature that my literary texts provided me. But\
  \ never really got the chance or could come up with the courage to materialise what\
  \ my heart always craved for. After finishing my post graduation and having my break\
  \ up at the same time, my mind became a thriving ground for restlessness and an\
  \ uncontrolled discomfort with everything around me. I couldn't make sense of what\
  \ exactly was happening.\nFortunately enough, I decided to visit the capital of\
  \ our country,  New Delhi, to pursue some coaching for my further studies  (At least,\
  \ thats what I said at home). But in my heart, it was just an excuse to get out\
  \ of everything that was familiar to me and to see and smell something new.\nWell,\
  \ my actual desire was to visit one of our most beautiful states Himachal Pradesh\
  \ which is actually an extension of the lesser Himalayas. All I knew about the place\
  \ was that its the abode of mountains and clouds. And that was more than enough\
  \ a temptation for me.\nSoon enough I made some really good friends who harbour\
  \  the same kind of fondness and love for nature. Well, the plan was set. Four of\
  \ us left together from Delhi to a small village called Malana in Himachal Pradesh.\n\
  After reaching the gate of the village by cab,  it seemed we need to trek for two\
  \ and half hours in order reach the top of the village. Being a non-trekker, I couldn't\
  \ understand much about what it takes to trek all the way up to the top of a mountain.\
  \ I was rather pretty happy over the fact that something new is on the way. With\
  \ all my energies turned on, I began the trek.\nThe initial few minutes were pretty\
  \ smooth (Since we were descending first) \U0001F601 But as soon as began the ascend,\
  \  my body started showing signs of utter discomfort. I could feel the heaviness\
  \ over my feet and my thigh. They were moving but with great difficulty. And each\
  \ breath was getting tougher.\nI stopped, several times, and started questioning\
  \ myself, why even I am inflicting so much of pain on myself! Suddenly one of my\
  \ friend came to me and said \"Puja, trekking is nothing but a test of your endurance\"\
  . Each word of this sentence that he uttered rang like a bell to me. Somehow the\
  \ words made a turbulence inside my heart. I looked around. My heart leapt with\
  \ a subtle sense of joy as I saw the lofty mountains standing upright against each\
  \ other in a form of chain and the Parvati Valley swinging like a snake in between\
  \ them. All my pain was reduced, if not completely gone, by this beautiful sight.\
  \ I buckled up. And yes, after the toil of two more hours I did reach the top.\n\
  Words might not describe how I felt when I reached the top. It was a very small\
  \ village with thousands of tall pine trees and a very few houses scattered here\
  \ and there. With a wild wind blowing hard and the sound of the Parvati River flowing\
  \ down the valley, the village was throbbing with Life!\nThere was no tears on my\
  \ eyes but yes, my heart bleeded with joy. A sense of ecstasy filled my whole body.\
  \ I never encountered such a serene sight before in my life. Something very beautiful\
  \ took place inside me. And I am still carrying the beauty in my heart. I am a different\
  \ person with a different sensibility from that day onwards. And trust me,after\
  \ tasting the fruit of travelling that day, I have now become a forever sinner.\
