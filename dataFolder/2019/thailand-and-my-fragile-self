Text: My story is about what felt like a nearly complete failure of my body in a new
  climate and culture. I suffered from food-related illness, dehydration, a motion-sickness
  for two weeks. I had to drop trou in the woods, and sustained minor injury when
  I was attacked by a human-acclimated monkey. None of these conditions were life-threatening
  in any way, merely a nuisance. However, as someone who uses my body constantly for
  work (chef) and transportation (pedestrian), I found by being in these circumstances
  that I rarely have to consider my body at all at home. During these couple-few weeks
  in Thailand, I felt more vulnerable and off-centered than I have in a long while-
  perhaps ever. As the weeks went by I became ever more grateful for my normally healthy
  and sound physical life at home. However, upon further contemplation I feel as though
  my physical distress might have been my response to feeling out of place in a country
  and culture where I instantly reveal myself as an outsider. Despite the bodily malfunctions
  I experienced in Thailand, I still look back fondly on my time there- the wonderfully
  warm people, the tasty street food, the extravagant monuments, and the gorgeous
  natural environment were well worth it.
