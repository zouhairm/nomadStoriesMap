Text: "Nothing quite prepares you for the quiet. \n\nStifling in its stillness, yet\
  \ filled with the soft footfalls of a few lingering tourists, the entrance to the\
  \ Church of St. James the Greater gaped open like a cavernous tunnel, acting as\
  \ both a tomb and stage for more than just the remains of the Count Vratislav of\
  \ Mitrovice. \n\nOne of the third largest church buildings in Prague, the Basilica\
  \ of St. James is a model of Baroque opulence. Situated less than 500m from the\
  \ heart of Old Town, it\u2019s a mere 5-minute stroll alongside the narrow street\
  \ of Mal\xE1 \u0160tupartsk\xE1. \n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the modest surrounding\
  \ buildings as I was though, for once inside, you\u2019re transported back to an\
  \ age of painted high ceilings and intricate bronze pilasters, all lined along the\
  \ main nave like petrified guards on duty. \n\nIntimately aware of the silence,\
  \ I couldn't help but think about my own spiritual upbringing.  Raised in a Muslim\
  \ household in Cape Town, I was accustomed to the fullness of mosques. The jostling\
  \ of many bodies standing side-by-side in pray, men in front, women at the back,\
  \ and submission in between. Yet here I was, lingering in the coal-coated iron doorway\
  \ of an empty church, suddenly unsure of what to do next. \n\nAs if on command by\
  \ some divine higher power, my fellow travelers respectfully removed their hats\
  \ in unison. Unsure if this custom was meant for the faithful only, I was saved\
  \ by my tour guide for the day, Michal, as he drew our attention towards the right\
  \ of the entryway. And I realized that my earlier assumption was incorrect - the\
  \ church wasn't empty. But for one lone occupant - the black and withered remains\
  \ of a human forearm. \n\nHung by a chain hooked to the ceiling, the shriveled hand\
  \ bathed in the low light of early winter Prague, shrouded in shadows as if in shame.\
  \ Legend has it that it once belonged to a jewel thief. As Michal told it, when\
  \ the thief attempted to steal from the altar of the Virgin Mary statue, the statue\
  \ herself grasped his arm and refused to let go, thus forcing the patronage to cut\
  \ off his hand as both a means to preserve the statue and as a warning for any thieves\
  \ to come. \n\nHands nestled in my coat pockets, stiff and unaccustomed to Old Town\u2019\
  s November frost, I couldn't help but think about the ironic wickedness of the entire\
  \ scenario.\n\nFor while many kneel in pray to repent for sins of the past, they\
  \ need only to look up to be reminded that some sins are not always forgiven.\n\n\
  How wicked indeed."
