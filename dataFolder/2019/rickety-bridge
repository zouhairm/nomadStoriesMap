Text: "After waiting for the water buffalo to wander from the middle of the road,\
  \ our bus stops at a wooden bridge designed for scooters. No way can this rickety\
  \ thing support our vehicle\u2019s weight. That we haven\u2019t stalled out on the\
  \ potholed dirt road is already a miracle. A short exchange occurs between Sophie\u2019\
  s older sister and the driver. Sentences in Khmer pass from the front of the bus\
  \ to the back, and the doors open. \n\nWe need to lighten the load.\n\nThere\u2019\
  s twenty-four of us exiting the bus. This trip is a family reunion. Those who immigrated\
  \ to the states reunited with those who remain in Cambodia. And me, Sophie's boyfriend.\
  \ Tagging along. I whisper to Sophie, seeing if I remember relatives\u2019 names\
  \ correctly. I don\u2019t. She laughs because my pronunciation is literally laughable.\
  \ \n\nWe congregate on a muddy bank near the bridge. Behind us the roadblock from\
  \ earlier approaches. I hope the animal doesn\u2019t hold a grudge. It was the recipient\
  \ of multiple honks. A nephew slips in the muck, his entire backside now encrusted\
  \ in brown. Younger family members tease him and the older women give hopeless sighs.\
  \ This nephew is a known klutz.\n\nI wonder if we\u2019re all about to suffer similar\
  \ fates in an effort to rescue the bus driver and our cargo. We\u2019re headed to\
  \ an orphanage near Sophie\u2019s birthplace, and we come bearing gifts. Sophie\u2019\
  s family has done well for itself. They want to give back. I worry destroying the\
  \ community\u2019s only way in and out of town will overshadow their good deed.\
  \ \n\nI also don\u2019t want to be stranded here. \n\nForget playing Good Samaritan:\
  \ I tell Sophie, \u201CI think this might be a bad idea.\u201D \n\nI frequently\
  \ use noncommittal words like \u201CI think\" and \u201Cmight\u201D because they\
  \ allow room for error. Maybe I\u2019m wrong. Everything works out. No big deal.\
  \ But if I\u2019m right, then I\u2019m in the extremely advantageous position of\
  \ being able to say \u201CI told you so.\u201D\n\nNo \u201CI told you so\u201D here.\n\
  \nThe bridge holds. \n\nThe bus crosses and we load back in.\n\nSomeone digs out\
  \ a towel for the muddy nephew. \n\nWe drive on. \n\nMore potholes. More honks at\
  \ ambling buffalo. \n\nLonely huts sit at the end of dirt paths cutting through\
  \ paddy fields. I ask Sophie how far we are from the town. She explains this *is*\
  \ the town.\n\nA wooden fence wraps around the orphanage, which is also a Buddhist\
  \ monastery. The fence\u2019s entrance is too narrow to accommodate the bus. Monks\
  \ uproot posts to widen the opening so our driver can park. \n\nWe seek out the\
  \ bathrooms. It\u2019s been a long ride. No toilets. Just floors with holes that\
  \ feed into an outside ditch. Plastic pails float in water drums. Scoop out this\
  \ water and pour it over yourself if you need to shower. Scoop out this water and\
  \ pour it into the hole if you need to flush.\n\nThe children are leery of us as\
  \ monks form them into lines to receive their gifts. Due to the eclectic nature\
  \ of the items in our goodie-bags, I wonder if any in-house fighting will occur.\
  \ Someone upset they didn\u2019t score the neon sandals, or disappointed they received\
  \ a coloring book while their friend got an action figure. \n\nDecades ago a visiting\
  \ aunt once surprised my sister with a dinosaur stencil set, and me a sports-themed\
  \ one. I wanted the dinosaurs. My sister said \u201Cthank you.\u201D I did not.\
  \ I screamed and hurled my gift aside and raged about how unfair it was that my\
  \ sister got the better present. \n\nWe were in a restaurant at the time. I would\
  \ have been allowed to order anything on the menu as long as it did not exceed twenty\
  \ dollars. But dinner was cut short; my parents were so embarrassed by my behavior.\
  \ \n\nNo tantrums are thrown in the Buddhist temple.\n\nThe orphans thank us with\
  \ folded hands and curt bows. I feel I\u2019m mooching good karma reserved for Sophie\u2019\
  s family. I\u2019m ashamed. I had nothing to do with the donations for these impoverished\
  \ children. My only contribution was a noncommittal insinuation that we shouldn\u2019\
  t cross the rickety bridge."
