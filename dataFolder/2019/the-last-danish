Text: "I lost my man at an international Santa Claus convention.  One moment, we were\
  \ strolling along the Copenhagen waterfront on a quiet Monday in July, making our\
  \ way to the Little Mermaid statue.  The next, we were suddenly surrounded by a\
  \ flock of Saint Nicks.  Overwhelmed by their vibrant red coats and cacophony of\
  \ cheers that occasionally harmonized into a chorus of \u201Cho, ho, ho!\u201D,\
  \ I found the situation amusing and took out my phone to record what I just knew\
  \ would be Instagram gold.  But when I turned to Simon to film his reaction, he\
  \ was gone.  I scanned the crowd.  Was he with Russian Santa?  Nyet.  German Santa?\
  \  Nein.  I stood on a bench and looked towards the water.  Perhaps he had gone\
  \ to the Little Mermaid.  But she was surrounded by Japanese Santas, and my blond\
  \ Swedish man was nowhere in sight.\n\nHow tiny and delicate she looked, carefully\
  \ balanced on her perch of stones just slightly offshore, with the Santas as her\
  \ guardians.  She gazed into the water, as if she no longer cared to be where the\
  \ people are.  Considering the possibility that I might never see Simon again, I\
  \ understood her sadness.  At least it was fun while it lasted.\n\nI thought back\
  \ to two months ago, when we had first met on a group tour of the Isle of Skye in\
  \ Scotland and had an instant connection.  I thought back to a week ago, when I\
  \ followed through on accepting his invitation to visit his home in Stockholm, a\
  \ city I had expected to get to eventually but never with such spontaneity.  I thought\
  \ back to last Saturday night, when, taking a break from the dance floor to grab\
  \ a drink, we decided to fly to Copenhagen on Monday morning.  He had caught me\
  \ looking at a picture of Nyhavn on Instagram and told me we could easily go for\
  \ a daytrip.  He took out his phone and booked tickets on the spot.\n\nI thought\
  \ back to our early morning, catching the first flight of the day and standing in\
  \ Nyhavn before breakfast.  The neighborhood famous for its rows of colorful block\
  \ shaped buildings with pointed roofs, lined up symmetrically to frame the water\u2019\
  s edge, was just beginning to come to life as we approached.  Waiters raised umbrellas\
  \ at empty tables outside the cafes as the occasional person walked or bicycled\
  \ by, dressed as if they were heading to work.  With hardly a tourist in sight,\
  \ we had Nyhavn to ourselves.  Lulled by the calm, it felt as if we had Copenhagen\
  \ to ourselves as well.\n\nFinally acknowledging that there was more we needed to\
  \ see before our 6pm flight back to Stockholm, we went in search of breakfast and\
  \ found a small bakery on a side street.  Delighted at the thought of eating a danish\
  \ in Denmark, I was quickly overwhelmed at the variety of options.  Simon immediately\
  \ identified a Swedish specialty as his choice, something referred to as a \u201C\
  vacuum cleaner.\u201D  A bizarre name, and a bizarre green tube pastry, but I couldn\u2019\
  t focus on that yet.  My eyes darted around the case, from the cherry to the lemon,\
  \ cheese, and others I couldn\u2019t identify.  Unable to decide, I finally asked\
  \ for \u201Cthe most Danish of the danishes.\u201D \n\nI thought back upon that\
  \ danish now, with its dollop of white frosting on one side and chocolate on the\
  \ other.  I had never even considered it.  And now my most Danish danish would be\
  \ the last meal I had with Simon.  If only I hadn\u2019t taken so long to decide,\
  \ we would have arrived at the Little Mermaid statue sooner, before the Saint Nicks.\
  \  If only I hadn\u2019t stopped to observe how quickly Nyhavn had filled up with\
  \ tourists during our breakfast.  If only so many times along the way, I wouldn\u2019\
  t be standing on the bench alone.\n\nWhat would I do now?  Make my way to Christiania,\
  \ the Danish hippie enclave?  Join the \u201CWorld Santa Claus Congress,\u201D as\
  \ their sign read?  And then, amidst the \u201Cho, ho, ho\u201D I heard the faint\
  \ call of \u201Chey, hey, hey.\u201D  And I saw Simon waiving at me."
