Text: "Things got a little complicated when I got into the plane.\nI felt sick and\
  \ forgot to unbutton the safety belt when I was allowed to (who could've known?\
  \ okay, it's a joke).  And when the pilot said this long awaited \"Ladies and gentlemen,\
  \ welcome to Canada\" I, honestly, didn't believe him. \n\nThe metaphysical smell\
  \ of maple syrup I already had when we landed followed me till I finally tried it.\
  \ \nGod, it's best thing ever... I still have its taste on my mouth. \nOh, and these\
  \ Nestle water bottles with thin necks that we don't have in Kazakhstan amazed me\
  \ as well (You may think I'm crazy if I point out this, but you just need to visit\
  \ Kazakhstan). \n\nSeeing people of diverse cultures made me feel this powerful\
  \ and nice sense of anticipation you have when you're about to dive into new world.\
  \ It wasn't a movie. It was so real. Could somebody pinch me or was it just a dream?\
  \ I still see dreams of Canada and I still have dreams about Canada, too... \n\n\
  The historical buildings looked full of stories I was about to learn, the nice wind\
  \ reminded me of the reality of everything around, the politeness of local people\
  \ told me about cosmopolitanism and clear water of Niagara washed away my mascara\
  \ and skepticism about miracles. \n\nI saw a huge billboard displaying Beyonce's\
  \ upcoming concert in Toronto and I cried. I literally cried. People say places\
  \ and circumstances can't make you happy, it's only you yourself can make it. \n\
  I disagree. I've never been happier than at that time."
