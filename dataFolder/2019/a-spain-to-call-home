Text: "I was only eighteen years old when my parents sent me off to Spain. I had little\
  \ time to prepare for the language barrier and so I took 6 months of Spanish classes.\
  \ I was feeling very confident about my communication skills, but had no idea what\
  \ I would find. \nYou see, living abroad runs in the family. My mother was a pioneer\
  \ in the 70s. My sisters and I grew up learning about the tales of Greencastle,\
  \ a small city in Pennsylvania, where she lived with an American family for a year.\
  \ \nWhen I got to Spain, I was absolutely frightened to discover I couldn't understand\
  \ a sentence of what the other kids were saying. Naturally, being from South America,\
  \ the Spanish I learned was very similar to my native language, the Portuguese,\
  \ than whatever sounds were coming out of these youngsters mouths. All these horrible\
  \ thoughts started to pile up in my mind. I would spend the whole year by myself\
  \ because I wouldn't make any friends. I would do really badly at Uni and I would\
  \ definitely not meet a special someone. \nI honestly don't know why I thought all\
  \ of that. I\u2019ve never had any problems making friends. I had always had more\
  \ friends than I could count on both hands and feet and had always been very lucky\
  \ with the boys. \nAs usual, life never gives you only the lemons you know, you\u2019\
  ve got to find a little sugar and her name was Maria Montserrat. A lovely  Mexican\
  \ girl who was also an exchange student living at the same dormitory as I. I could\
  \ understand her perfectly! And not only that, but she took me under her wings.\
  \ It was such a relief to have the Latin warmth even an Atlantic Ocean distance\
  \ from home. On the first day she even confessed she too had problems understanding\
  \ the other kids. She thought they spoke very fast, and with their mouths so clenched\
  \ one could think they were putting a ventricle show.\nSix months went by and not\
  \ only I had taken in the Spanish accent, I was even making jokes in a fast pace.\
  \ I made friends with mostly everyone in the building and made authentic connection\
  \ with at least a good hand of people. \nThat was the best year of my life. I fell\
  \ in love with a culture, a country and their people. I got a second home and took\
  \ a little bit of everyone I met with me. Even the very cute boy I had a fling with.\
  \ Oh yes, I got my share of romance too. I said I was lucky with the boys. But that's\
  \ a story for another time."
