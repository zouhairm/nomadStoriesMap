Text: "\u201CWhen you cut off an Arab\u2019s head, they continue fighting with their\
  \ feet.\u201D Seeing my discombobulation, he explained in hushed tones, for fear\
  \ of getting caught, \u201CIt means your tribe never surrenders. Your tribe has\
  \ never lost a battle. That\u2019s what it\u2019s famous for. You\u2019re aggressive.\
  \ It\u2019s in your blood.\u201D And just before leaving, he urged, \u201CBut you\
  \ didn\u2019t hear it from me, okay?\u201D\n\nA tribe? Tribes were things that existed\
  \ in storybooks, in tales told around a campfire, in depictions of ancient carvings.\
  \ Not in the 21st Century. But how wrong I was. Tribes are the very essence of Somali\
  \ society and heritage. There\u2019s even a chief! Your tribe determined everything,\
  \ from how you behave, to who your allies are to your very future prospects. And\
  \ yet, it\u2019s such a taboo topic, given previous tribal wars and ongoing tensions,\
  \ not to mention the recent genocide against my tribe. \n\nI didn\u2019t have the\
  \ slightest idea of what I was getting myself into. I had enjoyed the sheltered\
  \ upbringing of life in London, with my Roald Dahl books, Monopoly board game and\
  \ Cadbury\u2019s chocolate. I was new to Somaliland\u2019s golden sandstorms, singing\
  \ minarets and camel traffic. But, as is always the case with umpteen-generation\
  \ immigrants, I wanted to brave the journey alone to unearth my so-called roots.\
  \ \n\nAlthough, I wouldn\u2019t say I was completely \u2018alone\u2019. I had landed\
  \ myself a job in the capital, Hargeisa, with the most incredible 80-year-old woman:\
  \ former First Lady, pioneer for the eradication of FGM and the country\u2019s first\
  \ qualified Nurse-Midwife, the one and only Dr Edna Adan Ismail. I lived in the\
  \ room next to her at her Hospital and worked as her PA there and at her neighbouring\
  \ University. The latter offered courses in Healthcare as a way of rebuilding the\
  \ country\u2019s healthcare system following the genocide which ended only 26 years\
  \ ago. \n\n\u201CKill all but the crows,\u201D was the order given by the dictator\
  \ Siad Barre. The country had been left in tatters by the colonialists\u2019 \u2018\
  divide and rule\u2019 strategy. La Somalia Italiana and British Somaliland, two\
  \ previously separate countries, were forced into becoming one nation. Following\
  \ unification, Somaliland saw the complete collapse of its health and education\
  \ sectors as well as a series of protracted conflicts. In truth, there\u2019s no\
  \ word to describe the horrific stories people have told me across the generations\
  \ about life under dictatorship; about all the creative ways in which humans enjoy\
  \ torturing each other. This chapter in history was coined \u2018the Hargeisa Holocaust.\u2019\
  \ Travelling around the country in a 4x4 covered in the sand dunes dust, I could\
  \ see the remains of buildings left untouched following the bombing raids; the rubble\
  \ sending chills down my spine at the atrocities my tribe had to endure. \n\nMy\
  \ mother is a white, Belgian nurse who volunteered with M\xE9decins Sans Frontiere\
  \ at the end of the 80s. She was sent out with her team to Somaliland, where she\
  \ entered clandestinely, bullets being fired at her van. There, she met my dad,\
  \ a black refugee whose family had been decimated, and fighter in the Somaliland\
  \ National Movement, the resistance. Your typical love story in a war setting ensues:\
  \ they marry, flee to Belgium, are rejected by the white, provincial family on grounds\
  \ of race, and move to London, overcoming all obstacles. \n\nEdna knew my story.\
  \ It turns out everyone there did. In the hustling market street, lost in the lengthy,\
  \ colourful fabrics sold to conserve women\u2019s modesty, a vendor recognised me,\
  \ \u2018It\u2019s her!\u2019 The word must have got out that the white Arab girl\
  \ had arrived. There\u2019s no such thing as being \u2018mixed race\u2019 here.\
  \ Identity is static. \n\nThe news had even reached Somalilanders in Kenya, from\
  \ where I received my first offer of matrimony. A hundred camels for my hand. My\
  \ new friends grew agitated with excitement at the prospect of a wedding. In response\
  \ to my protests, they urged me that it was an unbeatable offer and that we would\
  \ have our entire lives to get to know each other.  \n\n\u201CBut you can\u2019\
  t marry him.\u201D An older woman interrupted. \n\nI was grateful for her input,\
  \ filled with wisdom. \n\n\u201CYou can\u2019t marry him because he\u2019s not part\
  \ of your tribe.\u201D"
