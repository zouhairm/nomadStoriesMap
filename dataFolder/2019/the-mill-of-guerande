Text: "After the unexpected suicide of his brother Marcos, Alan's life collapses:\
  \ he abandons his doctoral thesis in anthropology and his girlfriend Irune puts\
  \ his relationship on hold. Fed up with psychologists and useless self-help books,\
  \ Alan decides to do the only thing that could allow him to turn the page: to return\
  \ to the Brittany of his childhood; the happiest time of his life, the time of Celtic\
  \ music and walks through pink-coloured cliffs and sand-dusty beaches alongside\
  \ his brother.\nAfter arranging a Barcelona-Paris shared trip, he crosses by chance\
  \ his path with Luc\xEDa\u2019s, a student of marine science now turned into a painter\
  \ who, having lost her vocation, does not know how to refocus her future. Their\
  \ car suffers an accident as soon as it starts; while Alan and Lucia await for news\
  \ about insurance, they discover that they have much in common. The two travel to\
  \ Brittany: he, in search of memories; she, inspiration. After a bizarre combination\
  \ of trains, taxis and flights that render them in Paris a day after, the pair decide\
  \ to rent a car and travel together.\nAlan will guide Lucia through the streets\
  \ of Rennes and Dinan; he will show her painfully beautiful sunsets through pink-granite\
  \ coasts; and they will share the madness of the Interceltic Festival at Lorient.\
  \ Guided by the music of Alan's childhood, they will finish their trip in Gu\xE9\
  rande, at his grandmother's house next to Cr\xE9meur's mill. There, overwhelmed\
  \ by memories, he will be able to say his goodbyes to Marcos with the verses of\
  \ Gilles Servat: \"Tournez, tournes les ailes du moulin de Gu\xE9rande / Sur les\
  \ grains de mes jours envol\xE9s\u201D. \nNow life-long friends, Luc\xEDa and Alan\
  \ say goodbye to each other for a while. Luc\xEDa settles in Brittany, the perfect\
  \ blend of sea and beauty. Alan decides to try to recover his relation with Irune,\
  \ to finish his doctoral thesis and to become a writer. A story is already forming\
  \ in his mind. Its title will be \"The mill of Gu\xE9rande\"."
