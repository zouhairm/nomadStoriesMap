Text: "On the Tuesday, yesterday, the Terror Alert had been raised to Severe. \n\t\
  After Hammersmith, she had begun to chant. The Piccadilly line was yet to go underground,\
  \ and the sun shone in her face as her eyes shifted from person to person. Her hands\
  \ slipped out from underneath her garment; she rubbed at the rings on her fingers.\
  \ Her quiet prayer grew steadily loud, and guttural. The laundry bag between her\
  \ legs was not filled with laundry: the plastic was pulled tight, and the corners\
  \ to something hard and heavy pushed out from inside the bag. Her headscarf shook\
  \ when the doors opened and closed. In the tunnel, the lights flickered and we went\
  \ into darkness.\n\tAt Piccadilly Circus she looked me in the eye, and I thought\
  \ about diving on the bag.\n\n*\n\nWhen I\u2019d asked how the march went I listened\
  \ to what Tom said, up until the point where my pint arrived. \u2018So Israel, they\u2019\
  re at fault?\u2019\n\t\u2018Yes! Israel has the sixth largest army in the world.\
  \ Hamas is a band of civilian rebels. This is not a conflict; this is persecution.\u2019\
  \n\t\u2018Right. Right.\u2019 I sipped at my beer. The pub started to get busier.\
  \ \u2018But today\u2019s protest, you think it made a difference?\u2019\n\tTom took\
  \ in a breath and chewed on the thought. He and his Brixton friends had spent the\
  \ day, with a hundred thousand others, protesting for Palestine in Hyde Park. Their\
  \ bodies were smeared with green paint; they had stacked flags and signs behind\
  \ our table; each protester glistened and smelt of sweat. I had rubbed Hugo Boss\
  \ into my neck. Amar\u2014my mate from home; my connection to these people\u2014\
  was wearing shoes that cost two hundred pound. \n\tI made sure I sat next to Julia.\n\
  \tHer friend left for the toilet; balancing an elbow on her naked thigh, she asked\
  \ if I\u2019d thought of attending the march.\n\t\u2018Not really, no,\u2019 I said.\
  \ \u2018I\u2019m only here for a few weeks.\u2019\n\tShe sipped at her pint.\n\t\
  \u2018Also, I\u2019ve been travelling for a while, so I\u2019m not really in the\
  \ loop.\u2019\n\t\u2018Right,\u2019 she said. \u2018There hasn\u2019t been much\
  \ talk of Gaza where you\u2019ve travelled?\u2019\n\t\u2018Oh, yeah, there has.\
  \ I considered going to Tel Aviv at one point, with a couple of friends in Budapest.\
  \ Then the airport was bombed.\u2019\n\t\u2018Do you think that would\u2019ve been\
  \ appropriate? Gaza being only eighty miles away.\u2019\n\t\u2018Sure, yeah, I was\
  \ a bit naive I think.\u2019\n\tAfter she\u2019d finished her pint, she relaxed\
  \ a little, and asked me about my travels. I told her about Berlin, and how I couldn\u2019\
  t get over how good the food was\u2014particularly the middle-eastern food.\n\t\u2018\
  Well, you must get kebabs in New Zealand?\u2019 she asked.\n\t\u2018Yeah, yeah,\
  \ of course we do. Just not very good ones, it seems.\u2019\n\t\u2018I thought New\
  \ Zealand had quite a large immigrant population?\u2019\n\t\u2018Oh, it does. I\
  \ grew up in West Auckland, so they\u2019re all I know. But I think maybe a lot\
  \ of people are second or third generation, so, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t\
  \ think I\u2019ve experienced their food in quite the raw way I have over here.\
  \ Which is a shame, \u2018cause it tastes amazing.\u2019\n\n*\n\n\tThe man sitting\
  \ beside her had got off at Earls Court. \n\tAside from the train, the chanting\
  \ had ceased all other noise. People stood in a crowd near the door, holding onto\
  \ red and blue bars; she sat alone across four seats. Her head listing back and\
  \ forth. I felt the person to my left breathe heavily and move in his chair. In\
  \ the window, I saw the reflection of me and the other people on my row. Our heads\
  \ pointed to the ground, to the door, to the ceiling. Our eyes all fixed on the\
  \ woman; the woman wearing the hijab.\n\tHer hands clasped together; they shook\
  \ and the rings clacked.\n\tI looked at the map above the woman, and the lights\
  \ went dark. I heard myself breathing; I heard the woman chanting. Kings Cross was\
  \ in five stops. The lights came on, and I felt my pulse in my throat.\n\tShe looked\
  \ me in the eye.\n\tShe got off at Leicester Square."
