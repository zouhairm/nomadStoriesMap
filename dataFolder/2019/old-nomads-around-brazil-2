Text: "Last year I visited Chapada dos Veadeiros, an esoteric wild site at central\
  \ Brazil. In the first day there, I went to a dining in Alto Para\xEDso de Goi\xE1\
  s, a small village incrusted in a natural park, surrounded by small waterfalls and\
  \ creeks. The waiter was a tall bald hippie in his fifties. Although he had an athletic\
  \ body, his skin face exposed his age. He was from S\xE3o Paulo, the Brazilian megalopolis.\
  \ I didn't expect to find such an educated, keen on chatting person there, so I\
  \ inquired him:\n\xAC How come you ended up here? \n\xAC I graduated from university\
  \ over twenty years ago. I worked six days a week, twelve hours a day. I had a car,\
  \ a bank account, and social insurance. One day I went on vacation, and I never\
  \ returned. Nowadays I work sometimes as a waiter, other times as a gym teacher.\
  \ Before coming, I spent three months traveling by the Brazilian cost, teaching\
  \ gym classes in a recreational ship.\n\xAC You may have met peculiar people. \n\
  \ \xAC You bet. There was a fascinating old lady who lived on the ship. \n\xAC No\
  \ kidding.\n\xAC Soon after her husband passed away, she went on a cruise to Europe.\
  \ The old woman fancied the experience and repeated it. Her children were adults\
  \ with their own families. After a while, she realized those trips were less expensive\
  \ than living in a sizable condo. In the ship, beyond getting company, the lady\
  \ had a physician on board and recreational activities. The matron sold her property\
  \ last year and now she travels by sea. When a cruise is over, she disembarks, stays\
  \ in a hotel near the shore and boards in another route within two or three days.\
  \ The old lady spends her life traveling. All the crew cherishes her. She purchases\
  \ tours from the same sea line to feel at home. Nowadays, she lives on boats. \n\
  \xAC What about when she becomes even older, in need of caretakers?\n\xAC I believe\
  \ this woman and I share the same mindset. Live one day at a time. It is pointless\
  \ not living the present by fearing a future that is only a possibility. Anyway,\
  \ she confessed she had already saved the \u201Cdiapers\u2019 money\u201D: \xAC\
  \ \u201CI do not expect one of my offspring to shelter me in illness or senility,\
  \ son. I saved chips and registered instructions in a notary\u2019s office. When\
  \ I cannot travel any longer, I have chosen the elderly home where to be dropped\
  \ off. Until then, let us appreciate this sea, because the path matters, not the\
  \ arrival, isn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\xAC A few months ago I also met an audacious woman\
  \ like her. I went to S\xE3o Miguel das Miss\xF5es, extreme south of Brazil, for\
  \ an off-road expedition to San Mart\xEDn de Los Andes, in Argentina. At the hotel\
  \ entrance, I started a conversation with a woman in her sixties. When I finished\
  \ telling her about our challenge, she confessed, with a bashful smile:\n\xAC I\
  \ retired two years ago, after teaching preschoolers for third years in Porto Alegre.\
  \ Single, no kids, got my car and now I travel around the region. I spend fifteen\
  \ days here. Later, I go to Porto Alegre and stay for some days. When I get unsettled,\
  \ it is time to move on. During wintertime I dispense more days to Gramado or Canela,\
  \ they are famous for their frosted landscape. I always reserve three weeks for\
  \ the wine region, Caxias do Sul and Bento Gon\xE7alves. Afterwards, I start over\
  \ again.\nThe woman told me about siblings and nephews, she spent time with them\
  \ during Christmas and New Year Eve. After that, the former teacher grabbed her\
  \ old Volkswagen and headed to the road again. She added: \n\xAC Visitors are like\
  \ fish: they stink on the third day. \n\xAC See? There are other old nomads in Brazil,\
  \ the old hippie commented, laughing. \n\xAC Do you know where to go afterward?\
  \ \n\xAC I stay here for three more months then I go to Pantanal. From there, who\
  \ knows?"
