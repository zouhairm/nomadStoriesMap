Text: "My friends and I arrived to Punta Chueca, one of the last communities of the\
  \ Seri, an indigenous group of Mexico that call themselves \u2018sand people\u2019\
  . Once there, we took a boat for reaching our destination, Isla Tibur\xF3n, a piece\
  \ of land of 1,200 squared km is it known to be the largest island in the country.\
  \ As the Seri\u2019s culture was born there, it is a sacred place for them, so foreigners,\
  \ even Mexicans, need special permission from local authorities to visit it. \n\
  During our boat trip to the island, we were received by some curious dolphins that\
  \ jumped in and out to peek us. When the boat reached the coast, all looks for me\
  \ as a typical beach, only sand and sea. Luckily, in these group of explorers a\
  \ couple of biologist were with us, that helped me to discovered unexpected wonders.\
  \ \nWe started our travel walking deeper into the island while many desertic bushes\
  \ appeared followed by lot of tall cactus. What a paradox! We were in a desert surrounded\
  \ by the sea. Incredible wingspan birds were flying around, and the biologists identified\
  \ them like some rare type of eagles. At our feet a sand plenty of shells were extended\
  \ beyond our view. Since this is a restricted place, fossils are preserved almost\
  \ intact, that is why it is possible to appreciate colorful and really big shells,\
  \ larger that a hand size. The other treasures that we found in the sand were footprints\
  \ of bighorn sheep and coyotes coming from the big mountains in the middle of the\
  \ island. If I were on my own I would never paid attention in those little details.\n\
  Finally, for making the place even more surprising, in one side of the island, there\
  \ was a mangrove swamp that provide non-salted water allowing wild life to cohabit.\
  \ \nA couple of hours after, our boat guide order us to go back to Punta Chueca,\
  \ because the allowed time was already over. We were not sad but amazed to have\
  \ the chance to discover this out of a dream place. I never thought those ecosystems\
  \ that look so contrasting would coexists so close in a single island.  \nBefore\
  \ get in the car to return to the city, some children and women approached us to\
  \ sell some handicrafts. They spoke a native language and their Spanish was poor.\
  \ Their look was of misery as the same of the whole town. It is true they don\u2019\
  t have enough money for a comfortable life, but their richness comes from their\
  \ cultural heritage and natural resources."
