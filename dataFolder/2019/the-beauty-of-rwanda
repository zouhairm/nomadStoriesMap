Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find a country so beautiful and very different from\
  \ the other countries that I have been to in Africa . I traveled to Rwanda by road\
  \ from Kenya thus I had to pass by Uganda to get to the beautiful country . The\
  \ journey was very tiresome but getting to Rwanda restored my energy just from the\
  \ border the rural areas itself is nothing compared to Kenya or Uganda .Rwanda has\
  \ been reconstructing itself from the 1994 genocide where many people died, properties\
  \ were destroyed and the country went crumbing on its knees . However , that is\
  \ not the case right now a very vibrant country with a strong economy was awaiting\
  \ for me to explore . I got to Kigali city at night and I could not control my emotions\
  \ I was excited and it was beyond my expectations. The people were friendly the\
  \ could definitely tell I was a foreigner because of my physical features , the\
  \ country was very clean and the city looked stunning . For sure I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to be that astonished . \n\nMy tour consisted of visiting the genocide memorial\
  \ center where I got to learn a lot about the effects of hate crimes in a nation\
  \ . As a traveler I believe it\u2019s not always about leisure all the time and\
  \ for sure every country has a lesson that someone can learn from it and take it\
  \ with them for the rest of their life . I then got to experience the Rwandan culture\
  \ and I rented a traditional dress which is known as the mshanana and is worn during\
  \ special ceremonies because it is very expensive. This made me interact more with\
  \ the locals, I got to appreciate their culture and I even watched the popular Rwandan\
  \ traditional dance . \n\nThere is just something different about Rwanda that words\
  \ cannot even explain . The calmness and quite environment in the capital city told\
  \ me a lot about the citizens personal traits . The clubs even have sound proof\
  \ walls so that the citizens cannot be disturbed at night with noise pollution .\
  \ The cleanliness was amazing from the hotels to the city and even to the rural\
  \ areas. Let me not forget to inform you about the security which was on another\
  \ level. I did not expect to find police officers almost everywhere throughout the\
  \ day and at night as well just ensuring that everyone is safe. Investors have been\
  \ attracted to Rwanda thus very luxurious hotels as well as boutique hotels have\
  \ been established in the city and even in the national parks . If you want to see\
  \ gorillas Rwanda is one of the few countries in the world the world that one can\
  \ get an opportunity to see them. Thus Rwanda is a small country but very beautiful\
  \ . It is one of the African countries that has a very bright future ahead and will\
  \ definitely attract a lot of tourists in the coming years ."
