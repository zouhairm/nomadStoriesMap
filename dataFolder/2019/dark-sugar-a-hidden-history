Text: "I floated within a shimmering garden of coral, just south of the Great Barrier\
  \ Reef. In the warmth of that Queensland afternoon, I had no idea of the sinister\
  \ secret my journey would soon reveal. \n\nThe day before I\u2019d caught the Tilt\
  \ Train north from Brisbane to Bundaberg, visiting my friend Jess. A local, Jess\
  \ had promised an unforgettable shore dive with some of the loveliest corals and\
  \ nudibranch anywhere in southern Queensland. The train had passed thousands of\
  \ acres of coastal land covered with a wild tangle of banksia and paperbark trees.\
  \ But quite suddenly the landscape had changed to a rich red dirt, the legacy of\
  \ a long dormant volcano. The banksia disappeared, replaced by enormous tracts of\
  \ sugar cane. Green plantations spreading wide all the way to the horizon in the\
  \ west, and east all the way to the sea. \n\nBeneath us, glorious pink, purple and\
  \ orange corals grew in harmony with the gleaming schools of fish bursting between\
  \ rock and wave. This place, this splendid Eden was just so deeply alive. \u201C\
  Crazy beautiful right?!\u201D Jess called as we surfaced from the dive. \u201CNow\
  \ get your gear off, we\u2019re getting gelato!\u201D On our drive back to town\
  \ we passed endless fields of cane dotted only by the occasional cow or rocky outcrop.\
  \ \u201CYou\u2019ve got your own little Hadrian\u2019s wall!\u201D I laughed to\
  \ Jess when I spotted a low rock wall in a paddock. \u201CThat\u2019s the Kanaka\
  \ wall.\u201D she said. I was puzzled. \u201CWhat\u2019s a Kanaka?\u201D Jess stared\
  \ blankly at me, then laughed too. \u201CI don\u2019t know really! Black people?\
  \ I think the Kanakas were employed in the cane farms ages ago.\u201D\n\nTwenty\
  \ minutes later we were strolling lazily along Bundaberg\u2019s main street, gelatos\
  \ in hand. Pausing, I diverted a crowd of determined shoppers while I took in the\
  \ gracious Victorian buildings lining the street. Crass plastic shop signs clung\
  \ to their once elegant frontages. Then a series of deep, guttural sounds began\
  \ to flow nearby, and my eyes met those of a young busker with his didgeridoo. It\
  \ struck me that he was the first dark skinned person I\u2019d seen since I\u2019\
  d arrived. \n\u201CNessa!\u201D Turning, I saw Jess\u2019 face lift skyward. Following\
  \ her gaze, I beheld a sky filled with drifting black snowflakes. Choc mint dribbled\
  \ down my wrist as I reached out to catch this mysterious, delicate black snow.\
  \ The sugar cane farmers, Jess explained, burn their crops before the harvest. \u201C\
  The stalks stay, the leaves burn\u201D she said. \u201CThis is ash.\u201D I stood\
  \ in the middle of it, watching the sweet smoky breath of black snow fall gently\
  \ across those tired streets. \n\nLater, I followed the guttural drone back to the\
  \ lone didgeridoo player. \u201CHi.\u201D I said. The droning stopped. \u201CI really\
  \ enjoyed your music.\u201D A brilliant white smile lit up his face and I took the\
  \ chance to sit beside him. \u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D I said. \u201CI have a question,\
  \ but it might be a bit racist. Or ignorant\u201D I bit my lip as the brilliant\
  \ smile disappeared. \u201CWho were the Kanakas?\u201D I asked. He turned to face\
  \ me. \u201CYou\u2019re not local, huh? They were my mob, mum\u2019s side anyway.\
  \ Slaves.\u201D The word spat angrily out of his mouth, and I froze. \u201CI thought\
  \ Australia didn\u2019t have slaves?\u201D He shook his head. \u201CThey did here.\
  \ Sold my great great grandad at the port like he was cattle.\u201D My face flushed\
  \ with shame. \u201CThis whole place built on the backs of slaves. Wouldn\u2019\
  t have had sugar if there weren\u2019t cheap black fella shipped in to clear the\
  \ land an\u2019 plant it. Stole thousands of \u2018em from the South Sea Islands,\
  \ destroyed their lives. White fellas here like to forget.\u201D\n \nI stood on\
  \ the train platform the next day, irrationally angry at the town. This town which\
  \ blithely buried history beneath the fertile red soil. \u201COwn your damn mistakes!!\u201D\
  \ I wanted to shout it. Instead I turned to Jess and said, \u201CThe Kanakas were\
  \ slaves.\u201D She just laughed. \u201CDon\u2019t be silly! Only America had slaves.\u201D\
  \ The doors of the train slid open and as I pulled Jess into a hug I noticed the\
  \ black snow falling all around us."
