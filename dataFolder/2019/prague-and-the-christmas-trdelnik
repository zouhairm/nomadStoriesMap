Text: "A mass of tourists and locals huddle beneath the Astronomical Clock, one of\
  \ Prague\u2019s prime tourist attractions. They await an obscure and unfulfilling\
  \ animatronic brigade of centuries old sculptures known as, \u201CThe Walk of the\
  \ Apostles\u201D, with the hope of experiencing a moment which never fails to make\
  \ a crowd stop, and look up. This Old Town tradition takes place on the hour, every\
  \ hour, one that is both eerie and reverent. \n\tFew would argue Prague is the classic\
  \ and tragic gem of Central Europe. It is a city made up of beautiful baroque architecture\
  \ with slight and painful scars of its recent Soviet occupation. Turns out, it is\
  \ also the prime starting point of an alternative Christmas break. After the spectacle\
  \ of \u201CThe Walk of the Apostles\u201D ends and its observers scatter to their\
  \ respective meanderings; for the month immediately before, during and after the\
  \ Christmas holiday, Old Town Square is filled with a distinct aroma. Perhaps it\
  \ is the scent of the mulled-wine that frequents most Christmas markets across Central\
  \ Europe, or the seared to perfection street-meat that would make even the most\
  \ ardent vegetarian question their dietary choices. No, this distinct aroma is much\
  \ more powerful and authoritative in its calling to the passerby. This aroma is\
  \ of course, the Trdelnik. \n\tIn the heart of true and genuine cultural appreciation,\
  \ the Trdelnik (chimney-cake) is easily the heart of the Czech Christmas market.\
  \ The simple act of rolling dough around a stick, then frying it in sugar and walnut\
  \ mix will both delight and cause guilt within an individual. The sort of guilt\
  \ when something comes along that tastes so good you know it can\u2019t be good\
  \ for you. Although it is not unique to the Czech region, the unique bohemian signature\
  \ of Prague is unmistakable. The scene of light snow fall, the haze and color of\
  \ Christmas lights coming from every stand, and the Trdelnik as one\u2019s own constant\
  \ companion make a Prague Christmas market a haven for even the most secular. \n\
  \        I didn\u2019t expect to find a place that would make feel calm and satisfied\
  \ in such a way as I did in Prague, Trdelnik in hand."
