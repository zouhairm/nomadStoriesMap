Text: "Southeast Asia has a charm of its own \u2013 almost unbeatable by the west.\
  \ The amount of exoticness, diversity, gastronomy, landscapes, cultures, and adventure\
  \ this region packs within its gamut, is at times difficult to fathom. A sucker\
  \ for good food, backpacking, bustling markets, and a blend of old and modern, my\
  \ love affair with Southeast Asia started quite early, and continues to invoke a\
  \ serious sense of curiosity in me, to keep exploring more and more of these paradisal\
  \ states tucked away between the Indian and Pacific oceans.\n\nMy most recent wanderlust\
  \ for Southeast Asia took me on a solo trip to Vietnam! Ferociously intoxicating,\
  \ exploding with surreal limestone islands, glistening pagodas, sweeping rice paddies\
  \ shimmering in baffling hues of green, the soporific natural landscapes, a bucolic\
  \ countryside, and solid culinary punches, Vietnam turned out to be unlike any other\
  \ destination I had ever visited! I had dreamt of visiting this country for as long\
  \ as I can remember, and finally I was off on a much-awaited solo trip \u2013 to\
  \ dig into this slice of paradise, my way.\n\nHaving travelled to a handful of other\
  \ Asian countries, I felt the safest while traveling in Vietnam \u2013 be it on\
  \ the solitary roads of Ninh Bin, the hilly villages of Sa pa valley, or the maze-like\
  \ alleys of Hanoi City! No molestation, groping, or roving eyes/bad stares witnessed\
  \ \u2013 something that is a nightmare for every solo female traveller. Vietnam\
  \ was a breeze, in that regard.\n\nSince my journey was unfortunately time bound,\
  \ I could only manage to explore a few pockets of Northern Vietnam - the ever so\
  \ touristy Halong Bay, the rolling rice paddies of Sa pa valley, the magnificent\
  \ riverside life of Ninh Binh, and the beauty chaos of Hanoi Quarter. After visiting\
  \ each of these places, I realised I was taking a part of Vietnam back with me,\
  \ home. Such was the allure of this stunning Asian land.\n\nMy trip did not end\
  \ without some solid culinary punches that Vietnam threw at me. Vietnamese cuisine\
  \ sports an interesting mix of age-old flavours of the natives, adaptations from\
  \ colonial visitors, and modern-day twists. There are subtle variations in the taste\
  \ and ingredients by region, but overall, the food remains superbly seductive. While\
  \ there were tons of local dishes that piqued my taste buds, my favorites were the\
  \ super handy and delicious Banh Mi, Pho - the quintessential Vietnamese Noodle\
  \ soup, the tasty Bun Cha from the streets of Hanoi, the succulent Goi Cuon, and\
  \ of course, C\xE0 ph\xEA \u0111\xE1 (Vietnamese iced coffee) - this, I learnt,\
  \ is not your regular coffee, it is literally a phenomenon in itself! Hot black\
  \ coffee topped with a couple of spoons of sweetened condensed milk and some ice-cubes.\
  \ This coffee as creative and ingenious as coffees can get \u2013 do not leave Vietnam\
  \ without gulping down at least a few litres of these!\n\nVisiting Vietnam was an\
  \ experience I will never forget. Also, being my first solo trip, it was almost\
  \ like an exploration into my being, a testament to being comfortable with myself\
  \ and savoring each moment I was getting to know myself better."
