Text: "I was born and raised in India, with yoga mats and tea gardens. And, an array\
  \ of wedding seasons feeding me the traditional box of Indian sweets doused in clarified\
  \ butter and dollops of store-bought Vanilla ice cream. Having a mother whose shelves\
  \ held big books on Hatha yoga, Surya Namaskars fit in my life as easily as butter\
  \ melted on hot toast. \nHailing from East India, my weekends were enamored by the\
  \ Assamese tea gardens and time was spent gawking at the locals, plucking fresh\
  \ leaves over a pile, into lustrous bamboo-woven caskets. \nSkilled with Iyenger\
  \ Yoga over a two-month long course I did in Goa, whisking Masala chai into a cup\
  \ isn\u2019t one of my strengths since I am more coffee than tea bags. While I can\
  \ concoct a tall glass of Cinnamon Latte without rummaging through sturdy shelves\
  \ and popping by the nearest Starbucks, brewing tea might require some motivation.\n\
  \ Moved to South India to study Arts and found Mozart in crispy, flour-rolled dosas\
  \ enhanced with layers of coconut chutney and sometimes a tablespoon of churned\
  \ tamarind on the  Masala Dosa. Kerala\u2019s Chukku Kappi, a type of black coffee\
  \ with an infusion of ginger helped me forgot about the grease in hefty mouthfuls\
  \ of rice Pulao. \nOne of my out-of-the-box experiences was in Goa. Like the Chilli\
  \ flavored truffle you don\u2019t expect to find in your \u2018limited edition\u2019\
  \ box. From what I have heard and read, the Hippies began to live in Anjuna, Goa\
  \ in the 70\u2019s and I was lucky to have lived there for a couple of months, only\
  \ 30 years later. The shorelines of Anjuna proved to be their habitat and over time,\
  \ a lot of people began to travel to Goa to feed their curiosity.\nWith an Avocado\
  \ tree that sprouted during Monsoon and the Anjuna flea market only a couple of\
  \ minutes away; I spent a huge chunk of my Wednesdays chatting away, with Israeli\
  \ traders who would lay out their supplies under the hot sun. With the Goan bread,\
  \ Poi in hand and a Kingfisher, I walked around listening to the soft sounds of\
  \ an Acoustic and sometimes, significant drum-rolling. Priced at Rs. 40 a pint,\
  \ Kingfisher beers are popular in Goa.\nSaturdays were spent in the Arpora Night\
  \ market; inviting travelers for its \u2018shop, eat and dance\u2019 vibe that it\
  \ so comfortably wore and sent groups back home at 7 AM in the morning. Three course-meal\
  \ plans and a jug of Sangria were reserved for Cantare, a delightful restaurant\
  \ located in Saligao, known for hosting Goan musicians and charming Portuguese architecture.\n\
  \ A brunch at the Bodega Caf\xE9 in Altinho, Panjim on a Sunday offered the privileges\
  \ of dipping into the Goan city life. Fish Thalis or a serving of the local Cafreal\
  \  at the Anand restaurant , known to serve the best Fish in Anjuna could require\
  \ some preparation; one needs to reach early as the place is always queued and phone\
  \ reservations aren\u2019t accepted. Cafreal is a spicy Chicken dish, prepared with\
  \ copious amounts of Cilantro and black pepper. The cooking technique is almost\
  \ synonymous with a Thanksgiving Turkey. It is marinated in the sauce made out of\
  \ Cilantro for a good 12 hours.\nBetween all of this, I connected with Iyengar Yoga\
  \ that was soon to cure my posture and straighten my hunched back. The core of this\
  \ Yoga is alignment with each asana with the help of blocks and chairs. In an open\
  \ studio, I latched onto this form of Yoga like Cadbury chocolate inscribed aptly\
  \ to my lips. Taught by an Englishman, the morning classes started at 7 am in the\
  \ morning. I would throw on grubby t-shirts and dive into the mat for the next hour\
  \ that followed. These classes happened during the afternoon as well. I would sometimes\
  \ attend two classes a day. To my surprise, I noticed my back losing its decade-long\
  \ hunch and my shoulders gaining shape. The effort showed on a sunny day in the\
  \ Sweet lake of Arambol, North Goa. I was traveling with a friend, who had arrived\
  \ from Spain into the bustling, incense-scented bazaar of Arambol. We decided to\
  \ walk an extra mile and cross some boulders into the divinity that is the Sweet\
  \ lake.\nClustered between lanky trees and wooden benches laid comfortably, a dip\
  \ into the lake is necessary. To me, it holds the memories of fishing trips. The\
  \ shape of the lake reminding me of fishermen in Eastern Indian where the mighty\
  \ river Brahmaputra flows devoutly.\nMy friend photographed me, against the tall\
  \ trees, leaping into the lake with an abominable hunger. I had a look at them in\
  \ a beach shack, between mouthfuls of a Potato-Spinach Salad. I wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ if it was me! My back had straightened; I wasn\u2019t consciously twitching for\
  \ the right posture. The photo, taken candidly, had me gaping at myself. My hunch\
  \ having evaded, my body stood without slouching.\n And a friendship with Yoga was\
  \ formed."
