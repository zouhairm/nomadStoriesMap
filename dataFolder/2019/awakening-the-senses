Text: "Feeling the cold cobble stone street, she breathed in the ocean mist and felt\
  \ the golden sun bake her skin. She had never seen anything outside of her small\
  \ town consisting of a highway, Applebees, and Walmart. Google had been her best\
  \ friend allowing daydreams of far off places.  Stepping into the postcard, she\
  \ never imagined the colorful embrace causing a mile-wide smile. A new outfit, hair\
  \ straightened, fighting her unmanageable curls, playing a quick childhood game\
  \ of \"Eeny Meeny Miny Mo\", she started her days journey to see where this adventure\
  \ would take her.\n\nThe street went for miles up a hill, the roots splitting into\
  \ a maze of turns and twists. Screen doors open, women cooking the most amazing\
  \ smells that invited the unknown guest. Children filled the air with giggling laughter\
  \ as a soccer ball, caught out of the corner of the eye, went high in the sky and\
  \ closer to a make shift goal. Heritage embraced ever inch of visibility, pride\
  \ shining through all the cracks. Deep blues, greens, yellows, and reds provided\
  \ a masterpiece on every building's wall. Some fading with age and bowing to the\
  \ test of time. Clothes lines hung from windows, the clothes dancing the wind's\
  \ symphony. Hidden gems of local retail popping up like an investigative game. An\
  \ awakening of the senses, she had found a longing in her heart fulfilled. \n\n\
  Loosing track of all space and time, miles deep into the belly of her path,  she\
  \ realized she needed to eat. Phone dead from snapping her umpteenth photo, she\
  \ knocked on a screen door for assistance. Out stepped a woman so pronounced, so\
  \ fragile, so full. A conversation lead to a seat at a small kitchen table and a\
  \ cup of coffee. With the elder's shuffle, a building's wall matching plate was\
  \ set in front of the guest with mounds of delightful family recipes. Melting in\
  \ her mouth, the guest was speechless. With her crooked, somewhat toothless smile\
  \ the elder sat down and began her story."
