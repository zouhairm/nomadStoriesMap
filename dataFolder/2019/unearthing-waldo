Text: "In Oregon\u2019s Cascade Range an old tree stood guard over a forgotten story.\
  \ The memory was about an explorer named Judge John Breckenridge Waldo and his intrepid\
  \ spirit was that of John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. Waldo is the unsung grandfather\
  \ of Oregon\u2019s protected lands. It is because of his perseverance that six national\
  \ forests, Crater Lake National Park, and over a dozen wilderness areas exist today.\
  \ Yet, few remember Waldo\u2019s name or celebrate his achievements.\n\nThe tall\
  \ perpendicular woods and glassy mountain lake made seeing this old tree even more\
  \ intoxicating.  A year earlier while researching Waldo I spied a grainy black and\
  \ white photo. The picture was snapped in 1890; it revealed a couple of trees and\
  \ a canoe by a lake with the handwritten text, \u201CCamp Edith, Waldo Lake.\u201D\
  \ An interesting yet unremarkable image, except that Camp Edith wasn\u2019t referenced\
  \ on any map. After a year of research, my fellow explorers and I stood before those\
  \ words carved into the tree\u2019s hardwood \u2014 it was Waldo\u2019s \u201Clost\u201D\
  \ campsite. \n\nOur morning started with sunlight enriching the blue and turquoise\
  \ waters of Waldo Lake. The radiant vista poured 5-miles into the distance and an\
  \ additional 2 miles at breadth. As the sun rose further into the sky it revealed\
  \ depths of 60 feet or more in the crystalline-like liquid.\n\nFrom 1877 to 1907\
  \ Waldo extensively explored and chronicled the \u201Cuntrammeled nature\u201D of\
  \ Oregon\u2019s Cascades. He believed that modern life had \u201Cnarrowing tendencies\u201D\
  \ on a person and that wilderness allowed difficulties to \u201Cbe perceived and\
  \ corrected, and the spirit enlarged and strengthened.\u201D Waldo was a reflective\
  \ man who did not seek publicity. Rather, he quietly and diligently advanced his\
  \ vision: a 300-mile long protected swath along Oregon\u2019s mountainous crest\
  \ from the Columbia Gorge to the California border. Upon returning from his expeditions\
  \ he spent countless hours increasing public awareness through letter writing and\
  \ using his resources as a State Legislator and Chief Justice of Oregon\u2019s Supreme\
  \ Court to advocate for preservation. \n\nAfter Waldo\u2019s death in 1907, his\
  \ writings went missing only to be rediscovered in the 1980s. The papers now reside\
  \ in the archives at the University of Oregon. This is where I first saw the old\
  \ photo of Camp Edith. When I inquired with seasoned hikers, campers, and old-timers,\
  \ they had not heard of the camp. Finally, I met an aged flower child that loved\
  \ to backpack. Surprisingly, he knew about Camp Edith but only revealed, \u201C\
  When you find \u2018the tree,\u2019 you\u2019ll be there.\u201D\n\nThe following\
  \ winter I jumped into reading a rare 500-page copy of Waldo\u2019s transcribed\
  \ diary.  During his treks, he traveled for months at a time to nourish his insatiable\
  \ wanderlust and love of the Cascades. But like many travelers, he was often homesick.\
  \ To lessen the loneliness he christened a favorite camping site in honor of his\
  \ daughter, Edith. A colleague blazed the camp\u2019s name into a tree trunk.\n\n\
  The snow had melted in the mountains and some ground reconnaissance was needed.\
  \ I enlisted several members from a local hiking group to join me at Waldo Lake.\
  \ We walked into the forest to find \u201Cthe tree\u201D provisioned with a photo\
  \ from 1890, a few telling diary entries, and the mystifying advice of an old hippie.\n\
  \nProgress was slow as we bushwhacked through the woodlands, crossed marshy fields,\
  \ and scrambled over downed logs. We were close to calling it a day when a member\
  \ of our team let out a joyous shout. Thirteen decades of bark growth had covered\
  \ the blaze\u2019s perimeter, but the inscription was legible: \u201CCamp Edith,\
  \ Waldo Lake.\u201D \n\nWe had unearthed a sumptuous moment of discovery.\n\nAn\
  \ excerpt from one of Waldo\u2019s 1890 letters was appropriate to read-\n\u201C\
  The lake stretches away up to the North; crags and peaks tower above us. It is a\
  \ splendid scene \u2013 this source of rivers and cities, hid away, like pure trains\
  \ of thought from vulgar observation \u2013 in the deep bosom of the wilderness\
  \ buried. Camp Edith sends you greeting \u2013 greeting to Edith from \u2018Papa\u2019\
  s Lake.\u2019\u201D\n\nWe departed Camp Edith carrying Waldo\u2019s story with us\
  \ \u2014 our spirits nourished and renewed."
