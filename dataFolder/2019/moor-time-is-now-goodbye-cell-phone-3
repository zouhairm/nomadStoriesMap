Text: "Woke up in Marrakech, today en route to Essaouira. Started off in Berrima,\
  \ inside what I call the Rasta Pyramid (Riad Kainos) of Berber Ras Younnes, whom\
  \ I met earlier in the week, on the road toward my hostel. As I write this from\
  \ the Supertours Bus, thinking of just an hour before, I was waiting for a taxi\
  \ to the city center, to take this bus, that I\u2019m looking at Haile Selassie;\
  \ I tell Younnes too; \u201CYou look just like His Imperial Majesty!\u201D, he replies;\
  \ \u201CThank you\u201D, I told him the same yesterday when I noticed, on the terrace\
  \ of his parents home, he replied to me then, Yes, you do too. I\u2019ve heard this,\
  \ yet I believe he resembles him more than I, it is crazy the way Rastafari synchronizes\
  \ us.\n\nThe bus begins to move and all I see around me, are people on their smartphones,\
  \ immersed deep within; Spotify, WhatsApp, gmail etc, I\u2019m witnessing my usual\
  \ routine slap me in the face! I\u2019m leaving this incredible city to reset life\
  \ in a new one in 3hrs; Essaouira, A place I\u2019ve heard many good things about,\
  \ from friends within both Barcelona and Morocco. Marrakech and Essaouira, are on\
  \ my list of four cities to reach. I think the way things are unfolding, I will\
  \ reach all of them, no doubt. \n\nI\u2019m letting \u201Cmy\u201D phone GO! It\
  \ Isn't easy, because I utilize it for so many aspects of my livelihood. I'm highly\
  \ inspired in capturing moments with the camera and audio recorder; atmosphere,\
  \ textures, nature, emotion, just reality overall. I\u2019ve reached new heights\
  \ over the past three months, when I initially embarked on the journey to Barcelona,\
  \ via New York, from Detroit. Who would have thought It would've been stolen from\
  \ me the other night, out with friends playing music in the city!? \n\nEXXXXXHAAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLE!!!!\n\
  \nWHOMEVER HAS IT/WHEREVER IT IS, INSHA\u2019ALLAH! \n\nI wish I could cue up some\
  \ Jazz,  or my current new creations, to balance my mind. Feeling a little more\
  \ grounded and present, than the previous nights, even sitting by the window on\
  \ this bus, within a tight space (not uncomfortable thankfully), closing my eyes\
  \ naturally, yet glancing out to desolate lands of , sand, trees and mountains,\
  \ I begin to process that I\u2019m on original lands, Alhamdulillah; here having\
  \ nothing and everything at this point, are synonymous, one in one (I&I); beautiful!\n\
  \nI give thanks to Reda, for helping me and his community in Berrima to progress\
  \ on our daily activities in relation to our computer needs, which some in the USA\
  \ take for granted, having our own macs and iphones at our fingertips. Reda\u2019\
  s shop, is similar to an NYC bodega of electronics. He sells phones, cameras, batteries,\
  \ portable speakers, prints resumes, always with a smile, which shines throughout\
  \ the narrow street of Berrima. Knowing that my phone is gone, Reda allows me to\
  \ check my messages online and lends me an old digital camera, so I can continue\
  \ to take pictures on my journey. He tells me that I can bring it back, when I arrive\
  \ again on this trip, or give him thirty Euros to keep it. My plan is to do both,\
  \ yet he cares mostly to just help and bring peace more than anything; true will\
  \ of Allah.\n\nMy mind begins to transition from my phone and visions of a past\
  \ life, of travels in the prior city, toward new insight and focusing on fulfilling\
  \ my purpose.\nSeeing various hues of green, yellow and magnificent red flags, has\
  \ me wondering; \u201Cwhat if Europe, never invaded Morocco or Africa?!?\u201D I\
  \ think this thought now and then, but it is a much stronger, now that I am on my\
  \ own in this country of my roots, and on this bus with more than half of the people\
  \ from some country within Europe. I\u2019m certain I\u2019m one of the few, if\
  \ not the only one from the U.S.A., though I am proud to be from there, I don\u2019\
  t wear it on my sleeve, I feel a much stronger connection within this amazing continent,\
  \ so yes here is home, I love you MOTHERLAND, all of you. Doooozing off with my\
  \ head on the window, more later..."
