Text: "It was 4:27pm on December 9th, 2019 when we decided on a spur of the moment\
  \ adventure. It was our 2nd day in Chiang Mai, Thailand\u2019s cultural capital\
  \ and its second largest city. We had just rented our scooter for the week, a 125cc\
  \ Honda Click, and taken it around the old city wall in Chiang Mai to get lunch\
  \ at the North Gate street food market. We were approximately 35 min from a mountaintop\
  \ temple, Wat Phrathat Doi Suthep, and we had an hour and a half till sunset. \u201C\
  There\u2019s a temple on a mountain about 30 minutes away. You want to drive up\
  \ there and watch the sunset?\u201D I asked. \u201CSure, that sounds fun.\u201D\
  \ I knew she\u2019d like the idea. She was adventurous just like I was. That\u2019\
  s why I had invited her with me on my two-week trip to Thailand. We had only been\
  \ dating for 2 months when I invited her, and we hit the 6 months mark that day.\
  \ But I had expected some sort of resistance to the suggestion of driving a newly\
  \ acquired scooter up a mountain at sunset in a Thai city. After all, we had experienced\
  \ the pure and utter insanity of Thai driving etiquette in our previous four days\
  \ in country. To say traffic laws don\u2019t exist in Thailand is not entirely correct,\
  \ but they are followed more as guidelines than actual laws. We set out from our\
  \ hostel just outside the southeast corner of the old city and followed the walls\
  \ till we reached a 4-lane highway that led west towards Doi Suthep. The road was\
  \ completely straight, lined with businesses and restaurants on both sides. We passed\
  \ a Mitsubishi dealership showcasing new truck models America would never see. On\
  \ the right was a Japanese restaurant called Tsunami Sushi, purportedly the best\
  \ sushi in Chiang Mai, which we ate at a few nights later. Then we reached the two-lane\
  \ mountain road over which stood an ornate arch denoting the name of the mountain\
  \ in Thai. When I say the road was steeply curved, you will probably think of a\
  \ road near you that winds its way up something or through somewhere and think,\
  \ \u201CWhat\u2019s the big deal?\u201D But unless you live near Pike\u2019s Peak,\
  \ your road is not in the same category. This road was extremely steep; pushing\
  \ 40-degree inclines with large inward banked turns on blind mountain corners. That\
  \ tickles the motorsports enthusiast in me but coupled with a large volume of traffic\
  \ and dangerous driving decisions made by every native driver, and the fact that\
  \ I had my girlfriend on the back of a relatively small automatic scooter, I have\
  \ to say, my palms were sweaty. I fixed a GoPro to the front of the scooter before\
  \ we left, so if you don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m about to tell you, I have\
  \ the proof. Within the first 10 turns we had been passed by a red 4-door sedan\
  \ driving dangerously fast just a few feet off my handlebars; came around a blind\
  \ left hand turn only to see a Songthaew (a red mid-sized pickup which uses the\
  \ bed to transport locals and tourists) coming around a blind right hand turn that\
  \ had crossed the yellow divider line into our lane in order to pass another slower\
  \ moving Songthaew 200 feet ahead of us; a turn whose angle changed so sharply and\
  \ deceivingly halfway through that it caused me to veer almost into the guardrail\
  \ at speed; and much, much more. It was gut wrenchingly terrifying at times. It\
  \ was utterly enjoyable at times. Overall it was quite an adventure. It felt like\
  \ a thousand turns to the top but, admittedly, it was probably closer to 50. And\
  \ at the top, around the back of a magnificent golden stupa, we stood on a lookout\
  \ railing basking in the grey fog and cloudiness that had crept in during our drive.\
  \ Even with the sunset obscured, I couldn\u2019t help but be drawn in to the beauty\
  \ of Chiang Mai and the surrounding mountains. I knew I would return to this place\
  \ someday. \u201CHappy 6 months Babe. Now we have to drive back down.\u201D"
