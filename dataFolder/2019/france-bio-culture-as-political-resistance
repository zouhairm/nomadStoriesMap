Text: "In the area of \u201CLot\u201D, in the south of France has been experiencing\
  \ a surge of \u2018Bio\u2019 feeding, food produced without any chemicals, culture\
  \ over the last two decades. But it is much more than the recent trends of organic\
  \ food. Who are the people behind this phenomenon? How do they survive and how does\
  \ production intertwine with their political views? What role does the State takes?\
  \ How does the market react in the face of this increasing demand?\n\nIn France\
  \ there\xB4s a very popular legend amongst the southern population, that tells the\
  \ story about a hummingbird who fought a forest fire. When faced with uncontainable\
  \ flames, all the animals ran towards a lake to save themselves, yet the hummingbird\
  \ moved back and forth, from lake, to fire. The animals were surprised by the hummingbird\u2019\
  s actions and asked what was he was doing. The hummingbird replied that he was bringing\
  \ water from the lake to the fire area to try to stop it. The animals laughed and\
  \ asked if he thought his efforts were enough to cease the fire, and the hummingbird\
  \ answered that while he did not know for sure, at least doing what he could to\
  \ stop the flames that were destroying everything.\n\nThis legend holds many of\
  \ parallels to the philosophy and the behavior of many independent producers that\
  \ are partaking in the movement of \u201CBio\u201D food. While large supermarket\
  \ corporations and food industry giants hurt the land with monoculture and infect\
  \ the crop with carcinogenic chemicals that go straight to our bodies, bio producers\
  \ look for a new way to produce food in harmony with the environment and 100% natural."
