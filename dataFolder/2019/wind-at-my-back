Text: "When you fly somewhere, the tail wind allows less resistance and the arrival\
  \ time is much sooner than scheduled. \n\nWind at my back is the travel story of\
  \ a place where the culture, the vibration of love and unity slows time down and\
  \ pull your innerbeing out of fear, the sheer authenticity of human interaction\
  \ is a physical force that pushes you out of your box and into the spirit of the\
  \ nation. \n\nYou find yourself enthralled ready to emwrse into the history and\
  \ language. You find yourself allowing to be excited, passionate and creative. The\
  \ resistance the illusive fear of social rejection isn't there. The fear that has\
  \ been propogated and injected into North American media that attempts to taint\
  \ the beauty and peace that actually exsists in Mexico. Puerto Vallarta is a place\
  \ that has grown in tourism because of the preservation of au thentic Mexican culture,\
  \ a major distributor of bannanas and agave based peoducts, Jalisco is full of beautiful\
  \ untouched places where you can see the history of Spanish colonization  and Roman\
  \ catholic tradition and the coexistence of native Mexican culture, food and Ceremonies.\
  \ \n\nThe tourism Industry continues to grow, and despite media propoganda , Mexico\
  \ is. Major vacation spot for England, United States and Canada. \"Wind at my back\"\
  \ is what I feel when I am there, at any moment in time I could fly through the\
  \ green and luah Palmas of Mis Maloya. The sound of the waves that crash a little\
  \ harder when sun isn't out, seems like a call that let's the aun know it's time\
  \ to shine. The nights with  iguanas watching over you as the mariachi plays Hotel\
  \ California. The smell of corn and   cooking, the sounds of the birds singing and\
  \ Latin music on the radio on the background. The taste like lime and salt on the\
  \ brim of your tequila. The warm nights and breeze of the sea. The sound of two\
  \ Mexican ladies talking to each other while  making tortias .All these human experiences\
  \ become a feeling of release. \n\nI felt that this place could only push me to\
  \ embrace the future, a push to euphoria , a wind at my back."
