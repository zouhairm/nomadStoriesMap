Text: "24/25 - 04   Ballota - Luarca\n\nA lovely walk into the woods, ended with the\
  \ view of the sea. Yesterday, during the evening, I understood that I don\u2019\
  t need company every time but just for sharing some time, few thoughts, a meal.\
  \ Eveline (a middle age woman from Australia) was so friendly; she\u2019s the kind\
  \ of person that had lot of experiences. Her eyes and voice communicated the feeling\
  \ that life is a kind of precious thing, unpredictable. I have different questions\
  \ in this moment, that follow me in every step of the \u201CCamino\u201D. And Eveline\
  \ helped me to focus on the limits of those. So my vision is more complete now.\
  \ However, I\u2019m just a bit less confused - or lost - then when I decided to\
  \ start to walk the route to Santiago. In my life I haven\u2019t a certain direction\
  \ yet, except to follow the yellow arrows! The main thing I miss is the feeling\
  \ to be in a place, to be good in a part of the world. Probably it\u2019s not possible\
  \ to know in advance which situations and people are the best for us. Eveline said:\
  \ \u201Cthere\u2019s no reason for being happy; you are or not, but you can notice\
  \ what is more appropriate to yourself.\u201D For sure during a routine hiking day\
  \ there are perfect moments, the so-called \u201Cgood vibes\u201D. Actually it\u2019\
  s quite easy to be in that mood. When I get close to sea, with the mixture of silence\
  \ and the sound of waves, and the skin is hit by a soft wind, I feel at home. Maybe\
  \ not me, just the soul. Everything is so peaceful, time is cancelled, the mind\
  \ is competely free. Unfortunately this is not forever, it\u2019s not reality. It\u2019\
  s more a moment of heaven. Here on the planet Earth. \nA walking trip, like the\
  \ Camino of Santiago (I\u2019m doing the North path), isn\u2019t about visiting\
  \ places, museums, or the kind of touristy stuff. The landscape, sometime the cities,\
  \ offer the pilgrim to have a look into himself. I think it\u2019s the main purpose\
  \ for this kind of travel (the more primitive one, it\u2019s by feet naturally).\
  \ And the relationships beetween people are like they have to be. Everyone speak\
  \ the language of \u201CImagine\u201D. It\u2019s like to be in a bubble. I bet that\u2019\
  s how we figure happiness. \nFew kilometres before reaching the \u201Calbergue\u201D\
  \ I had a few words with a guy from Ireland. He told me that after the Pilgrimage\
  \ is hard to come back to everyday life, to the real life. But, what if \u201Creal\u201D\
  \ is what I can choose?\u201D"
