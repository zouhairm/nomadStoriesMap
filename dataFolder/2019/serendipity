Text: "The neon lights hurt my eyes. The sounds of horns honking and car engines running\
  \ pounded too loudly in my ears. It was twilight and pedestrians walked in purposeful\
  \ steps on the crowded pavement, forming streams of blurry figures. Maybe the locals\
  \ were rushing home after work, maybe the tourists were off to enjoy their second\
  \ and third dinners of the evening. Whatever the reasons, this scene overwhelmed\
  \ me. I had just arrived in Taipei after five leisurely days spent exploring Chiayi\
  \ and Kaohsiung.  \n\nThere were snaking queues in the National Palace Museum (NPM)\
  \ Main Branch. Parents called loudly after their children, and couples whined about\
  \ the long waiting time to purchase tickets. I skipped the queues and breezed through\
  \ security check with my ticket bought from NPM Southern Branch in Chiayi. I missed\
  \ close up views of Emperor Qianlong\u2019s collection of intricately-designed treasure\
  \ boxes on display in the southern branch. The quantities of people in both museums\
  \ were proportional to my stress level while visiting.\n\nI had to get out, fast.\
  \ Coming from Singapore, in which the pace of life was at least on par with Taipei,\
  \ if not faster, this discomfort was unexpected. Following the recommendation of\
  \ a friend, I took a train and headed to Fulong the next morning. My destination\
  \ was Cao Ling Gu Dao hiking trail.\n\nFor a September day, the weather was unusually\
  \ clear. As I walked away from the train station towards the entrance of the trail,\
  \ I felt lighter. I could hear birds chirping happily in the trees around me. I\
  \ watched a lone spider weave its web. A group of six hikers were having their break.\
  \ In the seconds it took for me to debate whether to stop to eat the sun pastry\
  \ in my backpack, they had smiled and beckoned to me. After the initial pleasantries\
  \ and expressing their surprise at me hiking alone, they proceeded to stuff me with\
  \ local delicacies of pineapple tarts and home grown passion fruit.\n\nWith their\
  \ brisk footsteps while carrying on a conversation on the slopes, I wouldn\u2019\
  t have guessed that this group of avid hikers were retirees. They had once worked\
  \ together, and now planned bi-weekly outdoor activities with each other. Their\
  \ lives after retirement are fulfilling, busy with hobbies and looking after grandchildren.\
  \ Their love and respect for each other was evident, there was none of those competitiveness\
  \ and bragging often portrayed by elderly characters on serial dramas. They genuinely\
  \ care for the well-being of each other\u2019s family members. And they generously\
  \ extended this sincere concern to me, a stranger lone girl who happened to be on\
  \ the same trail on the same day. Their passion for life inspired me. \n\nSuddenly\
  \ a shrill scream filled the air, and I knocked into Sister Wu who had stopped abruptly\
  \ in front of me. A snake had dropped from the overhead branches and frightened\
  \ Sister Bai. Later, they had varying accounts of the colour of the snake. Sister\
  \ Bai thought it was black, and Sister Zhen who was behind her, insisted it was\
  \ purple. I broke the intense discussion by telling them that seeing a snake symbolises\
  \ good fortune and that they should buy lottery when they were back in the city.\
  \  \n\nSilvergrass waved welcome to us in the wind. We had arrived at the most beautiful\
  \ spot, overlooking Guishan Island in the distance. My heart sang with contentment,\
  \ and at that instant, I was thankful to be sharing this magnificent scenery with\
  \ these kind souls. \n\nWhile waiting for the train back to Taipei, we observed\
  \ sparrows perched on the power lines. \u201CI'd rather be a sparrow than a snail.\
  \ Yes I would, if I could, I surely would~\u201D The day ended with light hearted\
  \ singing by Brother Liu.\n\nWhen I shared my itinerary with colleagues before the\
  \ trip, they questioned the blanks in the schedule. I cheekily replied that those\
  \ were room for serendipity. And serendipity, it was. I went looking for silence\
  \ and space for reflection, I had none of those, but received so much more, warmth\
  \ and advice from seniors. Excuse me while I go plan my next trip to Taiwan. We\
  \ have a karaoke date."
