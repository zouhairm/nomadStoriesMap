Text: "How many times do we take things for granted. Myself, I felt for this assignment\
  \ that I had to visit a spectacular location for my essay to be more exhilariting\
  \ and unknown. \nBut all it took was a walk to the local pier to feel the thrill\
  \ I do not encounter every day. The moment my shoes where off and my feet touched\
  \ the sand I felt transported - all my troubles remained ashore - all that was left\
  \ was me and the view of a magnificent sunset fighting with the blue sea. The rush\
  \ of the city was now a smell of salt and tranquility. The breeze calmed my nerves\
  \ and closed my eyes. Nothing was important at that instant, just the sound of the\
  \ waves crashing and the wind stopping my thoughts. I felt at ease for the first\
  \ time in years. \nIt had been a rough few months of not knowing where to go or\
  \ what to do. The city leaves no space for reflection nor doubt. The train doesn't\
  \ slow down to wait for you. \nEverything was going wrong when the thought of going\
  \ to the seashore came to mind. I'd never lived near the sea so it always had a\
  \ sense of thrill in my mind. The salty air, the clean breeze, the sound of crashing\
  \ waves that we in the city only hear on our phones to silence our thoughts and\
  \ fears before we sleep. \nThere I went, leaving my thoughts and obligations in\
  \ a bag in the city, some may say a selfish action, but my soul was pushing me to\
  \ visit the sea, a place where the fighing waves and hollowing wind silenced the\
  \ worst of your thougths and leave no place for nothing other than pure contemplation\
  \ of the beauty that is the sea - one of the last things that human life has yet\
  \ to conquer and destroy\nAs I took my shoes off and my feet felt the soft sand\
  \ , the air inviting my eyes to close for personal reflection and peace of mind,\
  \ the world seem to stop, nothing in the world felt important at that moment. Everything\
  \ that had stolen my sleep for the last weeks seemed to vanish into the waves like\
  \ a feather that looses itself when blown into the sky. Of course they are important\
  \ things, but that moment of feeling that all that was left in the world were myself\
  \ and the sea gave me a sense of liberation and wellbeing I had not felt in years.\
  \ The crashing waves were a melody to my ears, and the whistling wind a harmonious\
  \ chourus that I could have listened for forever. \nA moment with my feet in the\
  \ sand, the air playing with my hair was all that I needed. As my feet walked towards\
  \ the shore my problems vanished or hid behind the tall skyscrapers of the city\
  \ I wanted to forget for at least a moment or two. \nI knew my problems were not\
  \ going to disappear, but a moment away from them is all that I needed. As my toe\
  \ felt the cold water I thought I would step away, but no. It was as if the gelid\
  \ water cleaneded the troubles off my mind, at least for a moment which in my mind\
  \ felt like forever. As the waves crashed against my ankles and the lowering sun\
  \ warmed my face  I felt a serenity I had never felt - even the screeches of children\
  \ and the hustle of the beach had been silenced by the pleasure of being in such\
  \ an unknown environment - As I walked into the sea my body clenched from the cold\
  \ but my mind was so far away. The smell of salt was strong and the sun warmed my\
  \ face. The wet sand gave under my feet and no longer lingered between my toes as\
  \ it had done on the shore. As I opened my eyes all I could see is the inmensity\
  \ of the Mediterranian sea, so inmense and uninhabited. The waves glistened with\
  \ the last rays of sun of the day, and all I could fell was a peace I had never\
  \ felt."
