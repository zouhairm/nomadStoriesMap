Text: "In the one that is from best countries in our world, Arabian girl called Toya\
  \ came from Egypt for studying. That is happened after she faced too many obstacles.\
  \ All we know How most Arabian girls and womans suffering from freedom. Cause Arabians\
  \ think that a girl born to be a wife just not be successful manager, doctor, Engineer,\
  \ pioneer.. Etc. . So any of theses or other positions it isnot for her rights.\
  \ They must dream how to be a successful wife. But Arabians donot know that a woman\
  \ can be successful in more than one position. She can be a successful woman whatever\
  \ her position. So Toya was wanted to be a different girl. She always has a dream\
  \ to travel and explore the world. She wanted to see how our world from our eyes\
  \ very small but in real its very big. She dreamed to be a wife and mother but after\
  \ having a power and experience. She wanted to travel to do what other girls canot,\
  \ to carry her responsibility, to be very strong. She knows that god not create\
  \ her to just be a wife. All of us born to build the universe not men only. Toya\
  \ was lived in a very small city in the middle of Egypt. She tries all her life\
  \ to be different. When she finished high school she found a good scholarship for\
  \ studying in Spain.  she was appropriate and had qualifications to be applied.\
  \ But in family's opinion she is nothing she hasn\u2019t a right to dream any other\
  \ dream except to be a wife. Her father told her \u201C thank god about letting\
  \ you study until now, we haven\u2019t girls to live outside and alone \u201C. Toya\
  \ is not a weak girl to disappointed she flighted to achieve her dream, to travel,\
  \ to change her life, to be different. But finally she succeeded to pursue her parents\
  \ to let her go after she knew that she is accepted. The day traveling a day of\
  \ changing life Toya is excited to travel and living in spain and having friends\
  \ from different cultures. And finally the dream achieved after too many suffers.\
  \ At first of the period is very stable and good with exploring spain and relationships\
  \ with different cultures. But after that she faced some problems like being alone,\
  \ studying hard without helping of her parents and difficulty of living with strangers.\
  \ But Toya was knew that from these problems the experience and strength is come\
  \ so Toya after 2 years made a page in facbook being a consultant and gave her experience\
  \ to all arabian girls and students to live in spain and tried to give them part\
  \ of her strength to face  obstacles of their families and succeeded to achieve\
  \ their dreams. Toya after graduation she returned back to Egypt and employed at\
  \ high level company and she become a successful marketer. And every 5 months she\
  \ traveling to explore new countrynd culture. We know that carrying our responsibilities\
  \ without helping fromour parents is very hard but really all families must let\
  \ their childrens to carry their responsibilities in appropriate time. To let them\
  \ get a power and experience to live the hard life. For all womans I believe that\
  \ traveling is the most best way to be a powerful and to face that hard life."
