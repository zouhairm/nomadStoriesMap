Text: "BERLIN SMELLS\nby Sere Rouge\n\nIt's so strange! \nLast Saturday we were out\
  \ with ours friends, yesterday we were running to catch the bus. \n 3 March 2019\n\
  Four minutes... \nWarsaw station is not so small. \n\"Platform Number eleven\" you\
  \ scream me \"Run Sere, run\"\n You are unique to inciting me. \nI love and hate\
  \ you at the same time. \nSteps, escalators, walkways, and run, run away, out of\
  \ breath. \nWe are so sweat but we are here, we are seated on the pullman. \n\"\
  And now?\" ask you \"Can I remove the big scarf that enveloped me? And than.. Can\
  \ you say me where are we going this weekend?\"\n \"Tomorrow morning we'll be in\
  \ Berlin my sweet, I wanted to take you to eat shin and sauerkraut!\" \nI smile\
  \ you, I look you in the eyes and kiss you. I need inspiration to paint and you\
  \ know this.\nI did not want anything else, just stay with you and make a travel,\
  \ we can travelling all time, everywhere. \n11:08 pm, there are nine hours of travel\
  \ but we were happy! \n\nIt's dark outside. I see only small lights in the distance\
  \ and on the window glass, only raindrops. Outside less three degrees, it could\
  \ snow. The bus's warmth and the silence invite me to close eyes. The boy in the\
  \ front of my row, extends the seat up and to touch my knees, its so near, I can't\
  \ move. To complete this night, an Asian man beinde your side, start to snoring\
  \ and coughing at the same time. Sometimes, I think that I should write a book about\
  \ our adventures: two crazy travelers who want to explore the world but do not have\
  \ enough money to do it. So they organize economic getaways. We change the travel\
  \ mood. First-class shift? No, thanks, we prefer eigth hours into the bus!\n\nWe\
  \ love hard and destructive journey. Vienna, Paris, Bruxelles, Oporto, Rome, London,\
  \ Madrid, Granada, Canarie, Sofia and many others travels, we are more important\
  \ than the first class. \nWe don'have a lot of money and time, but we can leave\
  \ sometimes and discover the world! \n\nHowever, in this way,  we are managed to\
  \ defeat my problem with the claustrophobia. \nYou are at my side since seven years,\
  \  you support my crazyness. \nShip, coach, car, train, bycicle, we travel with\
  \ all transfert. We don't have stopped traveling, never. Maybe we decided to live\
  \ in Warsaw because it's a perfect position to discover the Europe. I'm so tired\
  \ now, I close my eyes and you whispers close to my ear \"wake up baby, we have\
  \ arrived\". It's 8:28 am, we're at Alexanderplatz, our Sunday in Berlin it's started.\
  \ 24H in Berlin! First stop: super breakfast! Outside the bus there are two degrees,\
  \ I need a big cup of coffee!\nCamera, bag and comfortable shoes, we are ready.\
  \ \nIts drizzling, but not let be discouraged. We through the Berlin center, from\
  \ the Neptune fountain; we cross the Sprea river and arrive at the cathedral. After\
  \  then the castle and the Branderburg Gate. First grumbles mark the lunchtime.\
  \ So we head towards the restaurant that you have chosen for this special sunday.\
  \ Double beer, big shin, sauerkraut and a lot of potatoes. Nine hours of pullman\
  \ for this,  could be as good as us. \n\nAfter the lunch, we walk to Monbijou Park\
  \ and then I go for some shop while you see the football stadium. It's almost 9pm\
  \ and our Sunday is about to end. The bus leaves at 11:45 pm, so we decide to eat\
  \ a sandwich on the street and get to the station. I like moments of silence in\
  \ which we savor the air of a new place before leaving. I smell the Berlino smells\
  \ in the air and I'm fine. Now, I just want to shake your hand, get on the bus and\
  \ continue to collect our memories.\n\nNight myDiary, see you a tomorrow\n\nxxx\n\
