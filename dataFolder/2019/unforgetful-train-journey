Text: 'Day started very lousy , it was 12 at afternoon I woke up and started planning
  my day : BING !! there was a text of my buddy -ya all set for the trip !! a quick
  recap _ I and my friend Raj have planned to explore an event in one of the prestigious
  college of India , IIT roudkiee , so this place was 700 kms away from our city towards
  north and luckily the place was near hill station , we both had never experienced
  the snow and all the cool snow stuff and it was our first trip alone without our
  parents so it was one in special in itself _ then I quickly get up from my bed and
  started packing my stuffs , the train was at night at 10pm so evening I left my
  home and lead towards my friend home and there we had dinner and his father left
  two of us to railway station because our tickets were in waiting his father talked
  to the ticket collector about the issue and he assured us that are tickets are all
  right by taking some commission he granted us in the train , after one hour of journey
  cops were rounding and checking tickets , we dumbass were sleeping because of excitement
  we couldn''t slept last night so we were relaxing , one cop came to me and asked
  for ticket and ID proof, respectively I showed him both the things with a statement
  that ticket collector aloud us sit but the cops doesn''t believed us , as we were
  18, cops told us okay if you find the ticket collector and get the valid ticket
  you will be spare otherwise  , you will be off at  next station . I and Raj were
  frightened and begin to find the ticket collector , so the situation was that it
  was 12 pm everyone was sleeping and the train has 14 department so I and Raj planned
  he will go this side to find and I will go the opposite side and whosever finds
  him give a call to another one , so we started to find that bastard peeking in every
  cabin , but god knows where that bastard was hiding , I assumed he was  sleeping
  in one of the cabin so I just started removing bit of bedsheet from everyones face
  and I got badly scolded by three person , the station was near if couldn''t find
  him then we were done at the next station _so our next plan was if we couldnt find
  the ticket collector, we will do something that the cops also could not find us
  . The station arrived and we both were shivering like a goat who knows his  time
  has come , i and Raj silently get into the bathroom and decided to remain here till
  morning untill our destination arrives , we know that it was illegal and had dare
  conseconses but thats the only option left. we slept  there and we dont know that
  how come  our sleep gone so long and deep that we missed our station and reached
  Jammu and we were literly laughing on us what the heck is going on and we decided
  to stop here only and enjoy Jammu and go back to home . Jammu was heaven for us-
  everywhere snow, our tiredness just escaped in seconed after seeing the snow we
  enjoyed there three days , done lots of stuff skiing , snow fight , everything and
  just wondering all my collegues waiting there for us and we are here . we left from
  Jammu with lots and lots memorious things and left for home from a BUS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!'
