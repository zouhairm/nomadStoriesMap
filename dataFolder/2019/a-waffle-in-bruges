Text: "As we passed through the border, we started to see some houses in between the\
  \ darkness. It was around 11 pm with almost no one in the neighborhood. With a yellow\
  \ plate number, we strive through Belgium and entered our next destination.\n\n\
  An ancient gate made by rocks really separate the usual town and this historical\
  \ center, as listed in UNESCO. Driving down the pavements, it felt like we were\
  \ having a trip to the past. We could see all the old buildings in the corner of\
  \ our eyes. Bruges welcomed us.\n\nThe hotel was in front of us already, but all\
  \ the doors were closed and no one was around. My dad soon started to realize that\
  \ there was a sign says visitors had to call the receptionist in order to enter\
  \ the hotel. No wonder, we must have been way past the operating hours. This problem\
  \ seemed to be very easy to solve. Unfortunately, the four of us didn\u2019t have\
  \ any Belgian number, let alone a European number. Our only effort was to turn off\
  \ the airplane mode and use my dad\u2019s Indonesian number to call the receptionist.\n\
  \nThey picked the phone up. So, the story of us stranded overnight in front of the\
  \ hotel could be scratched.\n\nWe carried our luggage into the hotel. My mom and\
  \ I had to stop for a second to admire this vintage elevator that we were going\
  \ to use. To enter the elevator, we had to literally open a door. I chose our floor\
  \ number, and we could see doors passed by.\n\nDing! Here we were with our luggage\
  \ looking at the mattresses as if it was a precious thing. Countless of hours sitting\
  \ in a car, that was why. The next thing I know, I took a bath and I instantly went\
  \ to sleep.\n\nThe Sun started to light the beautiful town and we could finally\
  \ see Bruges clearly. A stream flowed in front of the hotel. At that point, I was\
  \ in total grace, thanking God that I was able to witness this particular view.\
  \ We then continued to have breakfast, still felt dreamy of finally being there.\n\
  \nWe began walking and admiring the area. Discovered that Ren\xE9 Magritte and Herg\xE9\
  , the creator of Tintin, were originally from Belgium. Got surprised with the horses,\
  \ since its size was twice bigger than horses in my hometown. Strolled around the\
  \ bazaar that was filled with stalls. Enjoyed looking at people having fun in Bruges.\n\
  \nIt was too soon to say goodbye, but we needed to continue the road trip.\n\nAs\
  \ we were about to check out from the hotel, we asked the receptionist whether we\
  \ still got time to wander around Bruges, and we got an extra four hours to park\
  \ in front of the hotel!\n\nSince waffle is really famous in Belgium, we felt like\
  \ it was necessary to search one of the greatest, at least around Bruges. So, we\
  \ were down on the road again, with a digital map in our hand, following the instructions\
  \ to reach the waffle store. It took quite our time.\n\nThe map said we were already\
  \ in front of the shop, and here we were, looking at a closed store. About to get\
  \ upset with ourselves for failing, we then saw a sign, saying that the waffle store\
  \ was relocated to a new address. Trapped in a limited time, we insisted to try\
  \ once again. So, off we went to satisfy our curiosity.\n\nAfter spending more time\
  \ walking, our eyes caught a familiar store that we saw online. The store sign was\
  \ getting more visible, and we had finally found Lizzie\u2019s Waffle.\n\nWe could\
  \ feel the warmth of the waffle as we entered the store. Since they served the waffles\
  \ in big size, the four of us decided to order a waffle only, and then shared it\
  \ together. Little did we know, each visitor actually ate a waffle on their own,\
  \ except us. It was quite silly how contrast it was. Nevertheless, it was the best\
  \ waffle I have ever had. I can still remember the taste just like yesterday."
