Text: "When it comes to that point where you see your life flash before your eyes,\
  \ make sure that it is during or after accomplishing something worthwhile like saving\
  \ someone\u2019s life, adopting a child, or more daring, a strenuous hike up a gargantuan\
  \ mountain such as Kilimanjaro. This impressive natural landmark and Africa\u2019\
  s tallest, free-standing dormant volcano has been the inspiration of many a novelist,\
  \ short story writers, and journalists such as Ernest Miller Hemingway. The Snows\
  \ of Kilimanjaro, Hemingway\u2019s artistically successfully story yet, tells the\
  \ story of a bitter writer, Harry, who dies in Africa from gangrene before ever\
  \ writing about the astonishing moments of his life. Harry bemoans the fact that\
  \ he has wasted his talent.\nKilimanjaro is not only grand in stature but also in\
  \ its indelible spirit. For generations, East Africans have flocked to the silent\
  \ giant to revel in its beauty and majesty. They have revered the mountain for centuries\
  \ believing that God resides on the peak and so in terms of great need, they have\
  \ pitched camp at the foothills of the ancient silent giant known to them as \u201C\
  Kili\u201D.\n\nThis ancient masterpiece was formed 750,000 years ago by three inactive\
  \ volcanoes \u2013 Kibo (centre), Mawenzi (east), and Shira (west). Kibo, the youngest\
  \ and highest point rises to 19, 340 ft (5,895m). Mawenzi, the older core of a former\
  \ summit rises to 16, 893 ft (5,149m) while Shira, the remnant of an earlier crater\
  \ rises to 13,000ft (3,962m). In spite of its lava-spewing past and its location\
  \ three or so degrees south of the equator in Tanzania, near Namanga a breathtaking\
  \ ice dome envelopes the crater of Kibo. The snow-cap has, however, started to melt\
  \ because of climate change and global warming.\n\nNevertheless, Kilimanjaro casts\
  \ a tall, proud and majestic shadow over Africa standing as a powerful motif for\
  \ Tanzania\u2019s incredible extremes. The mountain\u2019s name creates an element\
  \ of mystery. While some refer to it as the Crown of Africa, God\u2019s Mountain,\
  \ Pride of Africa, many simply view the ancient silent giant as a metaphor for the\
  \ culmination of the beauty of East Africa. With a fascinating landscape and iconic\
  \ views, it\u2019s no surprise that many intrepid adventurers and thrill seekers\
  \ attempt to scale its heights. Although it remains a key test of human endurance,\
  \ it\u2019s still considered as one of the easiest mountains to scale, with hikers\
  \ ranging from age 12 to 90 years old! There are several routes for people to follow,\
  \ each with varied endurance requirements. The Marangu trail is by far the easiest.\
  \ During the five-day trek, climbers stay in three purpose built camps. The Maua\
  \ path is more challenging. Although it meets up with Marangu\u2019s highest camp,\
  \ there are no facilities available for the first two days, meaning you sleep rough\
  \ under the canvas. While some prefer this back-to-nature experience, others struggle\
  \ with the lack of home comforts. Keep in mind that trekkers are not permitted to\
  \ climb Kilimanjaro without a guide.\n\nScaling Kilimanjaro will take you through\
  \ five distinct zones. The lowest levels are cultivated farmlands which can be accomplished\
  \ with merely a walking cane and normal clothes. Next is the rainforest whose damp\
  \ grounds create a picturesque mass of plant life and idyllic winding rivers. The\
  \ third level is an expansive 3,200m of moorland and heath. It\u2019s here that\
  \ you\u2019ll break through the cloud line and find yourself surrounded by sky.\
  \ Beyond 5,000m, there is no vegetation only desert landscape and harsh rock face.\
  \ If you make it to the summit, you are confronted by a thin blanket of snow and\
  \ ice that makes it all the more worthwhile. Unlike most expeditions, the climb\
  \ up Kili is exhilarating and entertaining with its lower levels offering bespoke\
  \ 360 degree views of elephants, rhinos, monkeys as well as the elusive leopards.\
  \ \n\nAlthough completing the dramatic walk to the top of Africa\u2019s silent giant\
  \ is considered an incredible feat, there is much more to Kilimanjaro than its summit.\
  \ Whatever you choose to do in Kilimanjaro, you can guarantee that you\u2019ll take\
  \ away more than just lifetime memories. Unlike Harry in Hemingway\u2019s short\
  \ story, document your trip so that you don\u2019t have to bemoan the loss of the\
  \ best moments of your life."
