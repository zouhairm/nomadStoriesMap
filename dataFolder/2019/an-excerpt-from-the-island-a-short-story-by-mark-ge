Text: "This island seemed small, as the water surrounded myself in all four directions.\
  \ I walked along the sides of the roads, stepping in mud, and gravel, making room\
  \ for the zooming vehicles. There were stores on sides of roads, which sold dried\
  \ salt fish, bread, snacks, and cheese. Among the beverages were beer, and an arrangement\
  \ of carbonated beverages. I bought a beer, and walked on.\n\tStrong sunlight, clear\
  \ skies, and gentle animals grazing among pastures. No dog dared lie still for very\
  \ long, biting and scratching at mouth-watering fleas.  The sunset that rested on\
  \ palm trees distilled the open air with its pink mist. One could stand on top of\
  \ that hill, gazing down on the scene forever. Rows of tropical trees, lined up,\
  \ and scattered on the face of a mountain. Right above me, was a town. Two tires\
  \ lay on top of each other, a plant growing inside.  This unique structure symbolized\
  \ the center of the town, while stores, and resident areas located themselves randomly\
  \ among the dispatched allotment.  Children played outside on roads where taxis\
  \ brought people back down the hill. There were sinister looking people in this\
  \ part of town. Concrete bricks seemed stuck forever in\nmud. Material possessions\
  \ were limited to the fundamental  basics. There were latrines and no hot water.\n\
  \tBack on the beach, I lay on my blanket in the sand. The water was very clear and\
  \ clean. I could feel my skin absorb the salt from the ocean, as if it were a gift.\
  \ It made me feel good, clean, and sanitary. There rests in the right corner of\
  \ my eye, a mountain so grand and glorious about twenty\nmiles from where I lay.\
  \ It was a picture perfect view, the ocean, the sand, the trees, and the mountains.\
  \ It was there that I saw rocks that were jagged and full of holes, caused by the\
  \ effects of erosion. Small lizards, and sand crabs made this place their habitat.\
  \ While two men paddled themselves back to land, and unloaded the fishnets. They\
  \ brought what they had retrieved back home on their broad\nshoulders.  Making sure\
  \ I wasn't being watched, I followed them just a little up a path, and saw quaint\
  \ looking houses dwelling in shapes of circles. There the clotheslines supported\
  \ bed sheets, and clothes of the inhabitants. Next to that, kids making kites, and\
  \ adults talking on porches. Numerous dogs\nalso shared these living quarters staying\
  \ outside in yards that were fenced, or tied up to clotheslines that stretched forever.\n\
  \tThe canines on this island were generally scared of people.  You had to walk up\
  \ slowly to one, and gently pet them, constantly reassuring them of their fears.\
  \ Lots of them had nipples protruding from their bellies. A lot of them were also\
  \ homeless, damned to wandering the streets, and fending\nfor themselves. A sad\
  \ sight at first, when one sees these homeless dogs, or dead dogs in the middle\
  \ of streets.\n\tAt night I went down to the bars and mingled and immersed myself\
  \ in the local culture. This one bar I frequented at was a particularly nice one,\
  \ which felt very comforting and homely. In the middle of one room, there was a\
  \ large pool table, where people congregated around and played at. The\nwalls were\
  \ painted blue, which stood well against the tan colored domino tables. People slammed\
  \ down domino tiles, speaking loudly amongst the beer and cigarette smoke in their\
  \ local patois. Generally I could understand them, but I would get lost whenever\
  \ someone spoke quickly or softly.  In the other room, was the bar, which was your\
  \ typical bar setting with one exception. When you bought a beer, the\nbartender\
  \ asked you whether you wanted it warm or cold. I couldn't understand why anyone\
  \ would want something like warm beer, but their cold ones were really good."
