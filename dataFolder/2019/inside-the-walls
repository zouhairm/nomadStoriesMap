Text: "Over the past few years, Dubrovnik has become one of the biggest tourist destinations\
  \ in Europe with reports of overcrowding in the summer months as a steady flow of\
  \ cruise ships deposit people at its gates. Best known today, perhaps, for its iconic\
  \ walled Old Town and for providing the stage for King\u2019s Landing in television\u2019\
  s popular Game of Thrones, an accolade that local vendors tout left and right.\n\
  \tBut step away from the Jesuit Stairs and the marbled streets outside the clock\
  \ tower and you\u2019ll find the corners of what was once a sleepy town plagued\
  \ by a war-ridden past. Although fortunate to have avoided the worst of the crowds\
  \ by visiting in late September, I found myself seeking out the quieter alleyways\
  \ not in search of peace, but in search of shade.\n\tThe architecture is no less\
  \ exquisite here, swathes of sunlight followed by the cool darkness of the arches.\
  \ Tucked beneath one such arch in the south-east corner of the Old Town sits a surprisingly\
  \ modern coffee shop for a town that upon entry feels like a step back centuries\
  \ through time. I take my cold brew to go and continue down the path.\n\tIn the\
  \ shade of the city walls sits a minuscule garden. It is lush with flowering plants\
  \ and cacti, bright and beautiful but by no means overgrown or untamed. The cats\
  \ of the city \u2013\_of which there are many \u2013\_congregate here, basking in\
  \ patches of sunshine. I sit on the bench and a jet black cat cracks open one eye.\
  \ He stares at me for several moments and then returns to his slumber.\n\tI hear\
  \ voices nearby but there is no one to be seen. The voices come from above \u2013\
  \_those walking the city walls pass by overhead but with the angle, I cannot see\
  \ them, and I hazard a guess that they cannot see me, either.\n\tI sit for a while\
  \ until I observe the visitor book. So, I am not the only one to have found this\
  \ secret spot. There are greetings from all over the world, dozens of different\
  \ scripts and languages contained in the pages. I flip through the pages and am\
  \ overwhelmed by the gratitude of these strangers. Gratitude for this place and\
  \ its invisible caretaker. \n\tLater, I will walk the walls and try to spy the spot\
  \ where I sat myself. I cannot see so far over the sides but beyond where I believe\
  \ I may have sat are tumbled ruins left from the siege of 1991. Children and cats\
  \ alike dash through the crumbled landscape, their voices echoing up to the sky.\
  \ A mother emerges from an apartment stacked up high on a block, a typical architectural\
  \ feature of housing here in the Old Town, and calls down to her children. The youngest\
  \ gets waylaid, crouching down beside an amber cat and her litter.\n\tThe mother\
  \ shouts again and the little boy shouts something back. He skips over the ruins\
  \ with a practised ease and runs the several dozen steps up to his front door. It\
  \ is a town stacked up on itself \u2013\_you never know what you might find a few\
  \ feet below.\n\tDubrovnik\u2019s Old Town is known for its present: for the enormous\
  \ budgets that overrun the narrow streets to capture and utilise its beauty. But\
  \ where past and present intersect at the quiet corners inside the walls, there\
  \ is something different to be found. Something more rooted in the history of this\
  \ place and its people than what can be gleaned from the rising statistics or travel\
  \ brochures. \n\tI suspect that the cats know \u2013 but good luck getting them\
  \ to tell you the secrets of this town."
