Text: "\u201CPoo-Jav\u201D I said, leaning into the chrome circle at the center of\
  \ the window. The woman wrinkled her eyebrows, so I repeated, \u201CPOO-JAV.\u201D\
  \ Receiving a blank stare, I held my phone to the glass. She squinted, smiled and\
  \ exclaimed, \u201CAhh Poo-HAV, what time?\u201D I paid for my ticket, turned and\
  \ scanned the newspaper stands and snack shops tucked against the gray, cement walls\
  \ of the Bratislava train station. Hoping for something stiff to calm my nerves,\
  \ I wandered back into the drizzly December streets. \n\n\u201CYosef and Ivona\u201D\
  \ she said through a smile as she wiped snow from the windshield then climbed into\
  \ the car. \u201CAnd I can\u2019t believe I haven\u2019t told you their names.\u201D\
  \ I was thinking the same. The entire gin-infused train journey I stared into the\
  \ dark blue horizon, watched the silhouette of naked trees blur by and thought of\
  \ all the basic information I didn\u2019t know. I looked over at her beautiful face,\
  \ her elegant, gentle curls and red lipstick glowing in the light of the dashboard.\
  \ Feeling my glance, she looked at me and smiled, squeezing my hand before returning\
  \ her attention to the road.\n\n\u201CValesske-what?\u201D I asked. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s Valasske-Klobouky,\u201D she laughed, \u201Cand we\u2019ll be there in fifteen\
  \ minutes. Look, we\u2019re crossing the border now.\u201D I turned and caught a\
  \ glimpse of the sign that said we were entering the Czech Republic. Anticipating\
  \ some sort of change, I looked through the windshield but saw the same slush and\
  \ barren trees illuminated in the headlights, reminding me of the holidays I was\
  \ missing back in Michigan.\n\n\u201CNasdravi\u201D we all shouted, trying to tap\
  \ tiny shot glasses with large mittens then downing the homemade liquor. I had learned\
  \ it means \u201Ccheers\u201D a few weeks prior and was grateful because I was using\
  \ it a lot. We had hiked up a snowy trail through a silent forest, stopping often\
  \ to take group shots of slivovice. We were now high in a log tower, overlooking\
  \ the small town in the valley and the Slovakian border beyond the white sloping\
  \ hills spotted with dark green patches of trees. The wind kept us all bouncing\
  \ on our toes, heads tucked low as we clutched one another. She wrapped both her\
  \ hands around my waist and buried her face into my scarf. Exaggerating a full body\
  \ shiver, she gave me a big shake before looking up at me and asking with a smile,\
  \ \u201CYou ready to sit by the fire then cook dinner for my parents?\u201D \n\n\
  \u201CTofu?\u201D Her father peaked over my shoulder and then made a joke in Czech.\
  \ He smiled and turned, gesturing toward me with his hand. She turned from the cutting\
  \ board, rolled her eyes and looked at me, \u201CIt\u2019s more bullshit. I\u2019\
  m not going to translate it.\u201D I laughed and took the last rice wrap, dipped\
  \ it into the warm water and laid it onto the cutting board. She scooped the vegetables\
  \ and tofu into the middle, added some carrot, drizzled a bit of sauce, rolled it\
  \ up and put it on the plate. After scouring the local supermarket\u2019s vegan\
  \ options, we decided tonight\u2019s menu was going to be burritos and spring rolls.\
  \ I then put rice, beans and peppers into bowls while she set the table. Behind\
  \ her snow blew in circles on the glass doors as her parents sat side by side at\
  \ the table, sipping wine and gently swaying to classic rock. \n\n\u201CNice to\
  \ meet you\u201D her mother said after a short speech in Czech. Her father said\
  \ something else, didn\u2019t attempt any English, grinned and shook my hand.  \u201C\
  He said it was nice to meet you and that you should come back in the summer so you\
  \ can ride motorcycles.\u201D I smiled, thanked them, hugged her mother and shook\
  \ her father\u2019s hand one more time. Walking to the car she pulled me close,\
  \ shaking her head, \u201CI told you you\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t speak Czech\
  \ because all he talks about are motorcycles.\u201D I laughed, leaned and kissed\
  \ the top of her head. She looked up at me, \u201Cdid you have a good time?\u201D\
  \ I looked at the pines, the snow and then down at her, \u201Cof course Moni, it\
  \ all feels like home.\u201D"
