Text: "I braved a quick glance out of the window, watching the plane descend into\
  \ the veil of light fog cast across the city of London \u2013 boy they weren\u2019\
  t kidding about the fog. It was only twenty-eight hours before that I was living\
  \ a mediocre life, stuck in a loveless relationship and a career that wasn\u2019\
  t going anywhere. It was only twenty-eight hours before that I was boarding the\
  \ first leg of the flight, completely unaware of what I was about to get myself\
  \ into\u2026 leaving everything I\u2019ve ever known behind in a blur of memories\
  \ and jet fuel.\nI gripped the chair with all my strength and closed my eyes as\
  \ the wheels roughly hit the runway. This was it. This was the moment that my whole\
  \ life would change; the moment that I had been planning tirelessly for the last\
  \ thirty-five days. My whole body shook with fear and excitement, my mind - a scramble\
  \ of thoughts and what if\u2019s. I was crazy. This whole thing was crazy. Everybody\
  \ had said so, and I knew in my heart of hearts that no normal person simply wakes\
  \ up one morning and decides they\u2019re going to move half way across the world.\
  \ No normal person organises their visa and passport within thirty days of booking\
  \ a one-way ticket to England. Yet there I stood, in the middle of Heathrow Airport,\
  \ contemplating whether I dared attempt the tube for the first time with all my\
  \ luggage, or play it safe and hail a cab.\nI chose the cab. Standing in the waiting\
  \ bay I hailed the next black cab, and already I was fulfilling one of my London\
  \ dreams. The cab driver, an older gentleman with a grey English beret tucked nicely\
  \ onto his head, ushered me into his car. Lucky for me if I closed my eyes when\
  \ he spoke, he sounded exactly like Jason Statham. Another London dream fulfilled\u2026\
  \ well, partially anyway. \nAnd so, my London experience started promptly and with\
  \ no room for hesitation. The bustling traffic passed us, everybody clearly rushed\
  \ and unconcerned with whatever road rules they should have been abiding by. The\
  \ infamous red double-deckers towered over the cab on either side of the road, and\
  \ identical old-fashioned taxis of all colours - red, yellow, blue - honked as they\
  \ sped around cautiously.\nWe passed red telephone booths, churches, monuments,\
  \ tourists; crowds of locals and foreigners all blended together. In the distance,\
  \ as we crossed a bridge spanning the murky brown water of the River Thames, I spotted\
  \ the London Eye illuminated by the morning sun rising over the tallest of the city\u2019\
  s buildings. \nIt only took twenty minutes before we were brought to a sudden halt\
  \ due to a double-decker taking a corner too tightly and knocking a cyclist clean\
  \ off his bike. With the cab stopped, I was able to breathe in my surroundings a\
  \ little more slowly. I took in the movement, the noises, the cobblestone footpaths,\
  \ the brickwork. I watched as the sunlight disappeared as quickly as it had appeared,\
  \ smothered by the threat of grey, rain clouds.\nThe cab driver interrupted my thoughts\
  \ and for a moment turned into my own private tour guide: \u201CLondon is like no\
  \ other city you\u2019ll ever visit ma lady. It\u2019s barbaric, yet deeply civilised.\
  \ It\u2019s common, and royal all at the time same time. You\u2019ll come across\
  \ vulgarity amongst some of the most professional. It\u2019s sacred, and profane.\
  \ The past is always a part of the present in London, and that\u2019s why you\u2019\
  ll grow to love it, I\u2019m sure of it.\u201D \nI noticed I had been digging my\
  \ fingernails into the palms of my hands out of anticipation. I released them from\
  \ my skin, as I released the anxiety from my mind. Twenty-eight hours before I was\
  \ second-guessing myself, questioning my decision to pack my life up and start over.\
  \ Twenty-eight hours before, I was wiping tears from my cheeks as the plane had\
  \ ascended above the country I knew as home. But as I accepted taking a leap into\
  \ the unknown, afraid or not, I knew I was far better off than I was twenty-eight\
  \ hours before."
