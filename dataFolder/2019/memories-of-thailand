Text: "Finally I got permission from my parents to go to Thailand. Of course, the\
  \ agreement with my parents that I not only on vacation there, but also want to\
  \ study. Besides I crave a trip to the country, I am also determined to follow AWMUN\
  \ II 2019 (Asia World Model United Nations) at Prince Palace Hotel, Bangkok. I have\
  \ interest in education. I want to hone my skills in diplomacy, public speaking,\
  \ negotiation, speech and debate while building a broad network. These what motivated\
  \ me to register AWMUN, because in this activity the delegates will practice it\
  \ directly. And AWMUN held by IGN (International Global Network) aims to accommodate\
  \ young people in Asia to improve their diplomacy capabilities. Indeed that is what\
  \ I want to get, lucky I was chosen to be one of the Indonesian delegates to Thailand.\n\
  The day I arrived in Thailand, I took a total of 10 days of vacation. During the\
  \ week I spent time exploring Thailand and 3 days for competition. I spent 4 days\
  \ enjoying Thailand with a friendly and kind tour guide. Whatever my group and I\
  \ need, he is ready. He is even very proficient in Indonesian. As long as we enjoy\
  \ a beautiful tour in Thailand, we are also treated to a variety of delicious selected\
  \ foods. We have traveled a lot, we tour Siverlake, Wat Arunratchawararam, Pattaya\
  \ Floating Market, Laser Buddha, etc. To visit various tourist attractions, we have\
  \ to leave at 5:30a.m. and go back at 12:00p.m to fairly comfortable lodging places.\
  \ Bushed? Of course. But everything paid off with the beautiful scenery we had been\
  \ through. I also spent 3 days without a tour guide to just shoping in Bangkok,\
  \ precisely at Chatuchak Weekend Market and Pratunam Market. Very unique, as the\
  \ name suggests, Chatuchak Weekend Market is open every Saturday and Sunday (9:00a.m\
  \ - 6:00p.m), also Friday (6:00p.m - 12:00p.m). Whereas Pratunam Market is open\
  \ every day. \nAfter spending a week, finally entering the first day of AWMUN, when\
  \ the delegates arrived at the Prince Palace Hotel, delegates got their room number\
  \ and key, after which the delegates only registered at noon and the opening ceremony\
  \ at night. Entering the second day, the delegates focused on discussion almost\
  \ all day in accordance with their prescribed council. AWMUN presents the latest\
  \ issues for each topic area discussed on each council. There are 7 topics discussed\
  \ on each council, namely WHO, UNHCR, IOM, ILO, WTO, UNESCO and IMF. With 7 councils\
  \ being provided, delegation representatives can hold extensive debates on the topic\
  \ of the area based on their interest which can encourage them to find a solution\
  \ to the problem to be discussed. Me and my partner were placed in the ILO (International\
  \ Labour Organization) council and Malaysia as a review. Long before the event,\
  \ the committee gave instructions that this was a double delegate and the election\
  \ was random. I am from Indonesia and my partner is from South Africa, we have worked\
  \ together to make a position paper online. And this is the time for us to cooperate\
  \ face to face.\nOn the last day, we only visited the closing ceremony. In this\
  \ event there were cultural performances. After cultural performances, there was\
  \ an award announcement at the end of the event. Me and my partner received the\
  \ \u2018Best Delegate\u2019 Award of International Labour Organization. Honestly,\
  \ I personally didn\u2019t expect too much to win. Just being an Indonesian delegation\
  \ and bringing a lot knowledge and got the experience from this event could even\
  \ made me proud. I am very happy, finally me and my partner got award. We also voiced\
  \ together \"we did it!\". This is a very impressive thing in my life. Apart from\
  \ getting achievements, I also get holiday experiences here. I am grateful for having\
  \ dared to try to travel to other country and take part in international competition\
  \ for the first time. Here I got a lot of lessons, one of which is that I need not\
  \ fear taking any risks while it is a positive thing. Just like what I experienced,\
  \ I even accepted the risk and prepared myself to lose, but who knows that luck\
  \ is on my side."
