Text: "For my last semester of university, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity\
  \ to go abroad magical Lille. A thriving university city in the north of France,\
  \ Lille is peak France, diverse, rich cuisine, museums galore, a beautiful city\
  \ centre, freezing cold in winter... It's really not that glorious but for a small\
  \ town Australian boy it was the epicentre of my universe and the place where I\
  \ learnt to open my mind and my heart. \n\nDay 1 - I arrived in France with high\
  \ hopes and expectations and was disappointed immediately. Fresh off 26 hours or\
  \ so of flight time I stepped off the plane in Paris. Ridiculed for ordered my first\
  \ coffee/crossaint combo in English (which was culturally insensitive & ignorant\
  \ on my part) I made my way to the train station. Upon arrival our transport was\
  \ nowhere to be seen, and we ended up walking 30mins to our apartment suitcases\
  \ and all. Finally let in to our 120 year old building we made our way past the\
  \ penthouse and into the attic where I was presented to a room with no electricity,\
  \ a broken bed (no bedding) and all the vibrancy of a brick wall. I thanked the\
  \ realtor, sat on my mattress and cried myself to sleep - what had I done. \n\n\
  Day 2 - after crying for only the second time in my adult life, I dusted myself\
  \ off, downloaded duolingo, bought some bedding and got to work. There wasn't another\
  \ day for the next 9months where I didn't wear a smile. \n\nDay 3 - orientation\
  \ day. I played it safe initially, speaking to other students from Australia, Canada\
  \ & America before realising I was in a room of highly intelligent people from places\
  \ like Burkina Faso, Hungary, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Kenya, Finald, Colombia, Brazil\
  \ and ... Mexico. A country I only knew of from Netflix and American movies, a country\
  \ constantly depicted as either stupid, deadly or corrupt what would I have in common\
  \ with a Mexican, how wrong I was. Karla is her name, she has this stare that draws\
  \ you in, her sensual eyes are powerfully deep and far too easy to get lost in,\
  \ and then she speaks. Know we all know that Australian's don't necessarily do the\
  \ English language justice, but when someone speaks their second language better\
  \ than you do your first, any intellectual pride tends to dissipate fairly quickly.\
  \ I had to know her, but I knew I hadn't a chance so I retreated back into my comfortable,\
  \ warm shell.\n\nDay 4 and beyond - as the semester went on and I continued learning\
  \ from and about my wonderfully diverse cohort I kept being drawn in by this Mexican\
  \ beauty. I don't think of myself as a pervert, and I often judge men for staring,\
  \ but when she walked by, my brain walked away, my eyes walked with her and all\
  \ of the blood in my veins walked it's way to my... I think that's a story for another\
  \ time. I built up a really awesome friendship but that's a skill I have so it wasn't\
  \ really a feat. I later jumped at the opportunity to do a group assignment with\
  \ her roommate, knowing it might mean seeing her a little more. Finally, one cold\
  \ night all the students of the city flocked to the night clubs, consuming alcohol\
  \ brang is together and kept us warm. As I danced to Latin music I couldn't understand\
  \ in a seedy night club, I saw her smile and walk towards me, we danced and laughed\
  \ for hours. I've never kissed a woman unless she leaned in or gestured first, likely\
  \ out of a fear for rejection, but Karla's eyes pulled me in close, we passionately\
  \ kissed and as romantic as I see it in my memories I must remember the alcohol\
  \ and the state of the venue. For the following 4 months of the program we were\
  \ in separable, I've never learnt so much from another human, and then it was time\
  \ to say au revoir. \n\nBeyond - two 3month stints to Mexico, a one month tour guiding\
  \ stint in Australia and some impressive progression in this gringo's Spanish skills\
  \ we are now applying for a permanent residency visa. Amor"
