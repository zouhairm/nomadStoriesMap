Text: "To say that I was not looking forward to spending Christmas in a foreign country\
  \ would be an understatement. Being away from my family for the first time, but\
  \ also away from my beloved South African summer and all of the joy that comes from\
  \ a collective festive spirit was not something I was looking forward to.\n\nTo\
  \ say that spending Christmas in the hospital after a scooter accident was so much\
  \ worse than I could ever imagine, would be completely accurate. Confined to a soft,\
  \ peach coloured cage; braving 7/11 hotdogs three times a day; and falling asleep\
  \ to the sound of my 89 year old neighbour\u2019s reactions to a variety of Taiwanese\
  \ gameshows was not exactly my idea of a \u201Cholly jolly Christmas\u201D. \n\n\
  I was just about to face my noon hotdog when I got a call from an unknown number.\
  \ Deseperate for any form of adventure, I jumped. \n\n\u201CHi. It\u2019s Annie.\
  \ I know you\u2019re still in the hospital but your mom said in her Marli-in-the-hospital-update-email\
  \ that you get out on Friday. I\u2019m coming to get you. We\u2019ll do something\
  \ fun. Okay? I\u2019ve got to go, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m supposed to use this\
  \ phone. Bye!\u201D\n\nArmed with one backpack and a borrowed wheelchair we decide\
  \ that the obvious choice for this trip is the Alishan National Scenic Area. According\
  \ to the internet, it features cloud-ringed peaks and green valleys. In hindsight,\
  \ we should have had some doubts about what this description implies about wheelchair\
  \ friendliness. What we didn\u2019t doubt for one second was that this would be\
  \ the furthest we could get away, literally and figuratively, from my peach prison.\
  \ \n\nIn Chiayi, we board a train on the 106-year-old Alishan Forest Railway without\
  \ even realizing that this is the highest narrow-gauge mountain railway in Asia.\
  \ A spectacularly red ramp is rolled out for me, and I ascend the coach like an\
  \ actress from Hollywood\u2019s Golden Age. \n\nOn the three hour drive we are also\
  \ casually informed by enthusiastic British tourists that we have ascended from\
  \ an elevation of 30 meters to 2, 451 meters. As we leave the grey air pollution\
  \ and buildings behind and move stealthily toward the mist and giant red cypress\
  \ trees, I dramatically imagine the peach curtains flailing behind the train and\
  \ grudgingly enjoying the fresh air.\n \nWe arrive at the station, and I feel like\
  \ a proper celebrity. Hundreds of new passengers are eagerly awaiting our arrival,\
  \ and the cameras are flashing with fervor.\n\nAt the Sacred Tree station the train\
  \ empties with the signature enthusiasm of happy holidaymakers and bursting bladders;\
  \ and soon we are the only people left on the train. The conductor is running around\
  \ on the platform, frantically gesturing in our direction and shouting at his walkie-talkie.\
  \ We begin to suspect that we might be the cause of this panic, and increase our\
  \ effort to disembark without assistence, but suddenly the fact that the railway\
  \ is more than a hundred years old doesn\u2019t seem so romantic anymore. Without\
  \ a ramp, there is no way for me to leave the train.\n\nThe paparazzi are eagerly\
  \ waiting to meet their hero. I\u2019m the clumsy reporter, asking silly questions\
  \ and keeping them apart.\n\n\u201CAnnie, get off. You need to see this. I\u2019\
  ll wait for you at the main station. I\u2019ll be fine. There\u2019s a 7/11 and\
  \ a red ramp. I\u2019ll come back one day when my legs have healed. Go!\u201D\n\n\
  As Annie wades reluctantly through the crowd, they fill up the train and we start\
  \ moving out of the station.\n\nAt the next station, the conductor awaits us with\
  \ a smile. He casually motions over his shoulder; mutters something into his walkie-talkie.\
  \ Two young men emerge from the woods with a positively prehistoric stretcher. Before\
  \ I can make the connection, I\u2019m lifted from the wheelchair and carried into\
  \ the forest. In a spot of sunlight that shines valiantly through the dense canopy,\
  \ they gently place me on the ground.\n\nA phone is pressed into my hand.\n\n\u201C\
  Hey. It\u2019s Annie. Not sure what\u2019s going on, but I think they\u2019re bringing\
  \ me to wherever you are! I\u2019ve got to go, it\u2019s the nervous conductor\u2019\
  s phone\u2026 Bye!\u201D"
