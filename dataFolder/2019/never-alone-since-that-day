Text: "Imagine a kid, who had the chance of seeing 3 countries till he was 13 years\
  \ .\n\nAnd this kid, me, keeps one of these trips very close to his heart.\n\nIt\
  \ was the time when we flew to San Antonio, US, with my mother, \u0130lknur.\n\n\
  It was special, because this trip was for my mother. She was diagnosed with breast\
  \ cancer and my uncle Atakan, who lived in San Antonio, invited my mother (and me\
  \ with her) for 2 weeks before she started her chemotheraphy back in \u0130stanbul.\n\
  \nAfter a long flight, we have arrived to San Antonio. I saw my uncle waiting for\
  \ us at the gate. When he saw us, his eyes shined and he gave us a big hug. When\
  \ my mother saw my uncle, her eyes shined too, giving my uncle a big hug.\n\nHe\
  \ drove us home, where his wife Anita was waiting for us at the door with a big\
  \ smile. That night I couldn't sleep, both because of the jetlag and the happiness.\n\
  \nEven though it has been more almost 20 years, I remember every single day with\
  \ every single detail.\n\nOne day we went to lasertag, walking around labyrinths\
  \ and shooting at people. I have never had so much adrenaline in my life till that\
  \ day. \n\nAnother day we went to the movies and watched the movie ''The Grinch''.\
  \ I was surprised that the movies there did not have any breaks, unlike in the Turkish\
  \ movie theatres.\n\nI remember one day we went to the mini golf course. For some\
  \ reason I remember that day as the happiest day of the whole two weeks, hitting\
  \ the golf ball in this course for the first time in our lives. Me and my mother\
  \ looked at each other and hugged each other, telling each other how happy we were.\n\
  \nOne day we went to the NBA game of San Antonio Spurs & Houston Rockets. Our seats\
  \ were at the back, but as a child, I had the audacity to go to the most front seats\
  \ and sit there, until I was found by my worried uncle and mother, who thought I\
  \ was lost. I was just enjoying the game from the best seats.\n\nWe walked on the\
  \ beautiful Riverwalk one day, watching people from the boat we were on. We had\
  \ an amazing dinner under the beautiful lights.\n\nWhen it was Christmas day, we\
  \ watched a beautiful movie about kindness, love and respect. We ate lots of candies\
  \ that day. But the highlight of that day was when we opened our presents under\
  \ the christmas tree.\n\nI remember one day that we just hanged out at the house,\
  \ took a basketball and played at the court nearby. It was another amazing day,\
  \ simply doing nothing.\n\nAnd then it was the final day. It started hitting me.\
  \ We were going back.\n\nWhen we left the house with my uncle, Anita waved us from\
  \ the front door, trying not to make it obvious that she was crying. When my uncle\
  \ hugged us goodbye and we entered the plane, me and my mother said nothing to each\
  \ other for a long while. I sat at another seat, so my mother wouldn't see my crying.\
  \ My mother was crying too. I imagined jumping out of the plane door and running\
  \ back to the airport, staying there, forever.\n\nNow I am 32 years old, a young\
  \ professional who visited more than 70 countries. \n\nOur visit to San Antonio\
  \ was the thing that helped me become who I am now.\n\n2 weeks I will never forget.\n\
  \nAnd every trip I take, I am not alone. \n\nI also take my father with me, since\
  \ he went to another universe in 2009.\n\nAnd my mother, whom survived her first\
  \ chemotheraphy after San Antonio, decided to change to another universe after her\
  \ second chemotheraphy in 2016. She is with me too.\n\nThey are both with me, in\
  \ my mind, in my heart and in my soul, wheverever I go.\n\nMeanwhile I am just trying\
  \ to be a better person each time and make this world a little bit of a better place."
