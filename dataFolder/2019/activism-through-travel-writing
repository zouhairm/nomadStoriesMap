Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself struggling to emotionally deal with the\
  \ fact that tourists come into Africa and take a picture next to a starving baby,\
  \ all smiles and thumbs up.  I don\u2019t understand because this is the last thing\
  \ that I think about when travelling through the African continent and seeing poverty\
  \ stricken areas.  I don\u2019t need a picture to help me remember what poverty\
  \ looks like because the memories refuse to go away until I unpack them and five\
  \ years later, here I am thinking and writing about it.\nA couple of year ago, my\
  \ friends and I took a road trip from South Africa to neighbouring country Lesotho\
  \ to attend The Kome Caves Beer Festival which promised to be a fun filled weekend.\
  \ Even though the festival was epic there is a distinct memory that still haunts\
  \ me.  I remember on my last day sobering up from a drunken haze because I saw villagers\
  \ rummaging through the bins as we danced under the stars. I was shocked and I froze\
  \ for what seemed like a couple of minutes before I was shoved out the way by a\
  \ guy wearing sun glasses at night doing splits and hand stands in wet mud. I still\
  \ can\u2019t describe that feeling; I suppose this is why I\u2019m writing about\
  \ it.  Until now, I had forgotten that in Lesotho I hiked through scenic mountains,\
  \ drank water from a fountain and that I literally bumped into a sleeping cow because\
  \ it was dark that I fell in the mud. I forgot that the people were so kind and\
  \ friendly that they welcomed me into their home to take a bath because the festival\
  \ failed to provide adequate portable showers. When they saw my distress, they fetched\
  \ water for me from a river far away, boiled it in an open fire and cleaned up a\
  \ small room, so I could take a bath.  The poor people in the small village of Lesotho,\
  \ didn\u2019t have to share the little that they had but they did wholeheartedly.\
  \ I forgot that as we waited for the water to boil we shared a few laughs even though\
  \ we did not understand each other\u2019s language and that I helped to feed a toddler\
  \ that was running away from feeding time with his granny. I can\u2019t believe\
  \ that I even forgot about the long conversations I had by a fire with an elderly\
  \ man who spoke English with an American accent which I thought was hilarious and\
  \ a bit awkward. That moment when I saw children with their mothers, knee deep in\
  \ a pile of rubbish, I knew that I wanted to make the world a better place. I know\
  \ it sounds corny but it\u2019s true.  I really do want to make the world a better\
  \ place and only now in my early thirties do I realise that I need to tell real\
  \ , honest and empowering stories about travelling and not make it all about the\
  \ fluff.  I find travel content whimsical, fake and outdated. I hate that tourists\
  \ and travel writers take pictures of locals without asking for permission or go\
  \ into their hometowns to litter and look down on the people that live there.\n\
  I could go o and on about what I do not like but instead I\u2019m going to focus\
  \ on how I can do better, because I also have some shady tourist tendencies as well,\
  \ but that is a story for another day. Going forward, I\u2019m going to be respectful\
  \ of the places and the people that I write about and by doing so, I hope others\
  \ will do the same.  I will not be afraid to speak up when I see someone poising\
  \ next to a dying child and I will encourage them not to exploit people\u2019s poverty.\
  \ I want to be an impactful travel writer that will change the travel writing narrative\
  \ and make it more human and more real instead of writing travel pieces like day\
  \ dreams. The places and the people that we write about have feelings and are real\
  \ and so should our writing!"
