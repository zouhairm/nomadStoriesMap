Text: "Greetings! \n\nI am a current photojournalist with the U.S. Army Reserve and\
  \ am looking into transitioning into travel writing as I love to travel when i'm\
  \ not on duty. I feel this experience would be an awesome bridge to get a grasp\
  \ of how the industry differs and a chance to explore more of my creativity without\
  \ the constraints of overarching messaging.  Below is an excerpt of an article I\
  \ have written during my time in the U.S. Army. I liked this story because it showed\
  \ parallels and passion no matter the circumstances. more can be found by Google\
  \ or at www.DVIDShub.net. Thank you for your time and consideration. \n\nKANDAHAR\
  \ AIR FIELD, Afghanistan\u2014 \u201CI do it for the youth; there\u2019s just no\
  \ substitute for being able to pass your knowledge to the next generation and help\
  \ make a difference in a young adults life,\u201D said Warrant Officer Randy Jones,\
  \ Utilities Operations and Maintenance Technician Officer for the 760th Engineer\
  \ Company out of Marion, Va.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a great feeling when a student you\
  \ taught 15 years ago calls you on the phone and thanks you and invites you out\
  \ to dinner with their family,\u201D said Jones.\n\nJones, an Asheville, N.C. native,\
  \ joined the Army in 1986 at the age of 17. After spending 2 years on active duty\
  \ he was released from service during a force reduction and decided to go into the\
  \ construction business like the rest of his family. \n\nWhile working in the industry\
  \ Jones gained many certifications and licenses and was content making a career\
  \ in the construction business, but that all changed one day while he was reading\
  \ the newspaper.\n\n\u201CI really don\u2019t know what got me into teaching. I\
  \ was happy at my current job but saw an ad in the paper one day for a teaching\
  \ position and applied,\u201D said Jones. The next thing I knew I was hired and\
  \ it\u2019s turned out to be one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made.\u201D\
  \n\nAlthough Jones primary focus is on teaching he still operates a construction\
  \ business and has built over 50 homes in the past 15 years.\n\n\u201CBeing an educator\
  \ is great, not only do I get to teach what I love doing but the hours are flexible\
  \ enough to allow me to continue my own business,\u201D said Jones.\n\nJones has\
  \ taught workforce development, formerly known as shop, to high school students\
  \ in Winston-Salem, N.C. for the past 18 years.\n\nJones has always urged his students\
  \ to look into joining the military for the benefits and experience it provides.\n\
  \n\u201CI advise all my students to look into all their career options when they\
  \ finish their schooling and point out the many benefits the military has to offer,\u201D\
  \ said Jones. Nearly 20 years after I first joined I began thinking, hey why don\u2019\
  t I take my own advice.\u201D\n\nSince joining the Army again, Jones has served\
  \ as a Drill Sergeant and Warrant Officer where he has had the chance to continue\
  \ to teach.\n\nJones takes a similar approach to teaching both Soldiers and students.\n\
  \n\u201CTo me there is no difference in teaching a high school student or a Soldier,\u201D\
  \ said Jones. I can be as hard on them as I need to be, but at the end of the day,\
  \ I always make sure to tell them they are doing a good job.\u201D\n\n\u201CI feel\
  \ comfortable and confident when he is teaching me something new,\u201D said Spc.\
  \ Christopher Fussell, a horizontal construction engineer with the 124th Engineer\
  \ Company.\n\nJones said his many years of teaching have taught him how to be patient.\n\
  \n\u201CChief (sic) is a great mentor; he watches how we do things and gives us\
  \ feedback showing us a safer and more efficient way if possible,\u201D said Pfc.\
