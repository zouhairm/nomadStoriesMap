Text: "I run because the train will leave soon. I run, down the street, among people\
  \ who watch me run like crazy-boy. Run here, is only for crazy.\nBetween a shove\
  \ and shoulder, between one \u201CMi scusi!\u201D and one \u201CChi te murt!\u201D\
  , I hear a song. When I see her eyes, I find the source of that song. A deep, hazel\
  \ eyes. She has short disheveled hair. Blue fared jeans, ocher tank top. She is\
  \ sitting with a book on her hands, on the step of a bar. I stop running. Because\
  \ she's watching me. The first name of Naples was Partenope. The old fishermen,\
  \ tell that many years ago a siren was found on the shoreline, death. They also\
  \ say that some of them still live here. If you are careful you can still hear their\
  \ sweet song.\nWe look at each other, for six seconds. In those seconds, I realize\
  \ the relativity of the time.\nTo not look like a maniac, I stop watching at her\
  \ and continue on my way. For a few steps. I realize that that song didn't come\
  \ out of my eyes. I was size by a desire to talk to her. I go to her, without thinking\
  \ about what to say. It's not important, because, with that look, she undressed\
  \ me. I don't need any sentence to effect, no pretext.\nI arrive at her feet. She\
  \ looks me without saying anything. I start talking clumsy, improvising.\nI say\
  \ \u201CI saw you and maybe I'm wrong, but I think you looked at me, for six seconds...and\
  \ I couldn't stop, just like you can't avoid breathing a perfume. Maybe I'm wrong.\
  \ It is as our eyes had sought each other, at the same time, among the alleys and\
  \ the smell of coffee, following trails of cream and exhaust fume of scooter. And\
  \ here we are. Sorry if I scare you. I'm not a maniac, believe me. If I'm wrong,\
  \ say it, you'll never see me again, I'm leaving. But if not, would you like a coffee?\u201D\
  . She doesn't change expression, then, quietly smile to me.\nAt that moment, I fell\
  \ all my flesh melt and slip inside those dark irises. And I fell so light. While\
  \ I slide into that sweet darkness, I hear her voice whisper \u201CI'll show you\
  \ something first\u201D.\nWe get lost under clothe hanging, in ancient streets where\
  \ light and darkness seem to mix. Because this is Naples. The city of angels and\
  \ devils. A city built in the shadow of his killer. The piece of Paradise for which\
  \ Christ cried, giving birth to those tears the wine that drunk the city, paid dearly\
  \ by tourists.\nThen, we are walking by the streets, with our hands and mouths full\
  \ of fried fish that we eat from \u201CU Cuopp!\u201D. An abusive peddler tries\
  \ to sell us some little reds horns and an empty glass bottle, with written on \u201C\
  Naples' air\u201D.\nLet's take a coffee and a rhum babb\xE0 in a confectionery.\
  \ She looks at me with the same look as before and I can't stop thinking about when\
  \ I'll kiss her. Her eyelids close and we are in Sorrento.\nSorrento, I don't care\
  \ about your past, what is the origin of your name, I don't need to imagine Greek\
  \ and Roman ships playing your sea. I know that you smell of orange blossom. Your\
  \ taste is of freshly caught fish, roasted with eyes still alive. You are soft under\
  \ the palate like a \u201Clemon delight\u201D. On this terrace, Caruso sang to his\
  \ love, as I would like to do with you. But right now, I can't find words appropriate\
  \ to the beauty of this moment. Perhaps there is nothing to say. \nLet's back to\
  \ the city. Last walk through the alleys. We take a pizza and we share it, sitting\
  \ on a rock at the port. The noise of our jaws, of water on the rocks. In this moment\
  \ of pure peace, I realize that the sea at Naples is not like the others I've seen.\
  \ It's like a silk veil who wave, caressed by the sunset. In a moment it gets dark,\
  \ the full moon is like an eye, a few steps from Vesuvius. On the night, the Gulf\
  \ fills with small lights and they look like the lighters lit by the public at concerts.\
  \ While you observe it with wonder, you realize that it is who is looking at you\
  \ wonder.\nNow I'd like to kiss you. I look into your eyes, but when I try to get\
  \ closer, I slide again into your dark irises and I'm back to that street where\
  \ I was running. You are still sitting on the bar step, you are reading. I look\
  \ at the clock. It's late. I have a train to take."
