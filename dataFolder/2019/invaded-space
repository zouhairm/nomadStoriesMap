Text: "I was just 19 years old then, on the New Years' eve of 2002. After packing\
  \ up and staying with my uncle, who was a bank manager in Kano State Nigeria for\
  \ three weeks. I was indeed looking forward to becoming a medical doctor at the\
  \ Kano State University.\n\nIt was merely fifteen days to the screening examination\
  \ into one of the most prestigious Tertiary Hubs in Nigeria. Having left the well\
  \ planned concrete grids of Victoria Island in Lagos State. I soon realized my new\
  \ home would require an amount of immense mental help. \n\nIt is basically a landmass\
  \ of unequal topography that stretched out in short intervals into the most beautiful\
  \ and serene town I have ever seen. \n\nBeing located in the northern pole of Nigeria,\
  \ I noticed the countryside was covered by a clump of sparse shrubs hanging in the\
  \ dense clouds of the cold weather. Because of this aestheticism, the moment I was\
  \ conveyed into its territory marked one of the most enjoyable scenes of my life.\n\
  \nAnother astonishing side of the predominantly Muslim state, is their attitudes\
  \ towards the poor. It is held as a believe that the more you give to the weak and\
  \ downtrodden, the more Allah blesses the work of your hand. To this end, it is\
  \ a common phenomenon to see malnourished toddlers and teenagers alike with plates\
  \ in their hands, in thousands, begging for arms out in the commercial nerve centre.\
  \ Even adult beggars are not left behind; but no one looks down on them. \n\nAnother\
  \ cultural shock in vogue in Kano is the lack of food wastage, which is quite the\
  \ opposite of the tradition where I hail from. They believe so much that Allah forbids\
  \ throwing away of food, hence the need to pass any leftovers to people in dire\
  \ need of it. For instance, while in a canteen on 'Taiwo Street', I was compelled\
  \ to spare my remnants of rice and fried eggs to the \"Almajiris\", waiting outside\
  \ for some crumbs of meal. These are skinny looking kids who are believed to be\
  \ the right hand of the most merciful (Allah). Any time someone calls for their\
  \ help, there is a scramble of commotion, till there is nothing left. They normally\
  \ attend an organized Islamic School in the morning, funded by the Emirs, Islamic\
  \ Scholars and majority of Northern Bigots.\n\nAlso, wealth in Kano is measured\
  \ by the amount of herds of cattles amassed by the individual. Alarming still, their\
  \ ratio of a cattle to areas of available grasslands keep increasing geometrically,\
  \ so much so that, conflicts break out on daily basis due to invasions of farmlands\
  \ by cattles\u2019 rearers. \n\nWhile I was looking forward to being admitted into\
  \ the Medical College and eventually practicing my craftsmanship, I realized a typical\
  \ Kano dwellers do not conform to western ideologies. I was surprised to come across\
  \ my age mate who was already married to three teenage girls. He is a graduate of\
  \ the anti-western Almajiri School; he used to command my awkward attention a lot;\
  \ even though he has no traceable source of income. I always made a joke then that\
  \ \u201Chis lifestyle is being financed by the Emir of Kano\u201D. \n\n\nFurthermore,\
  \ I noticed that their architectural masterpiece is breathtaking and unique, with\
  \ plastered walls that cover the boundaries of the ancient city. It was said to\
  \ be necessary to ward off incessant enemies\u2019 invasions, and latter Portuguese\
  \ and British colonialists.\n\nTheir mode of dressing has been the same from time\
  \ immemorial, regardless of status. The adornment of the overall gown which covers\
  \ to the feet is widespread among men, while their women add the hijab to show purity\
  \ in accordance with the Islamic faith. This makes it extremely hard to differentiate\
  \ the rich from the poor in their community. \n\n\nThe former Governor of the state\
  \ almost singlehandedly imposed sharia law by consensus on its dwellers. We were\
  \ left panicked, until the decision was overridden by the President of the country\
  \ in 2002 (Retired General Olusegun Obasanjo). If adopted then, it would have set\
  \ the pace for religious extremism and ethnic cleansing of their perceived enemies\
  \ (Which we belong to, being Christians and Southerners)."
