Text: 'Kolkata is a city of joy and it is famous for Bengali sweets and sea food.I
  am here to guide you more about Kolkata which is located to the east India and capital
  of West Bengal state.




  Last December I was visited to Kolkata and people visit here for sea foods and Bengali
  sweets but let me tell you Kolkata is more than that there are tiny Islands which
  are situated near Hooghly river and ends with Bay of Bengal which is


  1.I travelled Sagar Island through ferry boat and it took around 6 hrs journey from
  Kolkata. It is famous for Hindu pilgrimage you can find different pilgrimages at
  different locations. I have visited the Temple of Maa Laxmi one of the goddess of
  wealth and beauty and its budget around Rs.80 /-per person from ferry.


  2.Second Island which I was visited Lothian Island Wildlife Sanctuary there you
  can see different kinds of animals and birds .which is available in this wild life
  sanctuary and it is do a visit place who are more adventures. To travel over there
  modes of transport is either by train or bus and it takes around 8 hrs of journey
  from Kolkata.


  I have visited the places which is away from Kolkata those who can travel it budget
  is around $214.


  These places which I have explained to you, are different from the city area those
  who wants to relax and stay away from traffic area then must visit these Islands.
  Best season to visit for these Islands from OCT-MAR. Food is better near island
  although I am vegetarian so I had full meal of veg thali which was very yummy if
  anyone who is vegetarian then can try veg thali.'
