Text: "I think, deep down, I knew I wasn\u2019t going to die. Nevertheless, the realization\
  \ didn\u2019t soothe me as much as I expected.\n\nI peeked out the window and immediately\
  \ regretted it.  We were flying through a thunderstorm in the middle of nowhere,\
  \ 35.000 feet above the Sea of Darkness, and the flight was way bumpier than what\
  \ I was comfortable with\u2014that is, not bumpy at all. Most of the passengers\
  \ were sleeping and, from my seat, I was able to see one of the stewardesses flipping\
  \ through a magazine, bored; but my eyes went from the window to the map on the\
  \ TV, as I clutched the armrests and muttered a prayer. \n\n\u201CNo, but I\u2019\
  m terrified of planes,\u201D I said every time somebody asked me if I was nervous\
  \ about my first solo trip, as a nineteen-year-old. \u201CI can never enjoy the\
  \ flight.\u201D\n\nThat said, one may find me wandering around the plane. This time,\
  \ I ended up sitting close to where the cabin crew was reunited. \u201CYou\u2019\
  re afraid of planes?\u201D asked a Spanish stewardess, offering me chamomile tea\
  \ and a crunchy chocolate bar. I nodded. By then, I was no longer embarrassed. The\
  \ latest friend I had made was a German old lady who, even though she spoke neither\
  \ English nor Portuguese, had hugged me through a bumpy landing as if she\u2019\
  d known me my entire life.\n\n\u201CYou actually enjoy flying?\u201D I asked the\
  \ stewardess. \u201CEven long flights, like this one?\u201D\n\nShe smiled from cheek\
  \ to cheek. \u201CIt\u2019s exciting.\u201D It must be why they\u2019re always so\
  \ pretty, besides the make-up and the perfect hair. They\u2019re doing what they\
  \ love and it\u2019s never boring, I suppose.\n\nTo me, who avoided flying whenever\
  \ possible, the only response left was another smile. Afterward, a Portuguese steward\
  \ explained to me why he felt safe in airplanes. \u201CIf you knew how rigorous\
  \ the crew\u2019s training and the aircraft\u2019s inspections are\u2026\u201D he\
  \ said and recommended a website which displayed, in real time, all the flights\
  \ currently going on in the world. \u201CThey\u2019re so many and they never collide.\
  \ Everything is very well-organized.\u201D\n\n\u201CAre you okay?\u201D said the\
  \ Spanish stewardess later when she passed by me with the beverage cart. I nodded.\
  \ There\u2019s something strangely comforting about the cabin crew being more worried\
  \ about you than about the flight. \n\nDuring the last remaining hours, the turbulence\
  \ no longer scared me, only annoyed me because they abruptly interrupted my naps.\
  \ Either you go or you stay, my Dad replied to my request for comforting words before\
  \ I boarded on the 12-hour-flight back home. At the end of the day, it was that\
  \ simple. \n\nOn my last flight, from S\xE3o Paulo to my hometown, Salvador, I met\
  \ a teenage girl who was almost thankful for our flight's delay. \"What if something\
  \ goes wrong?\" she said. \n\nI smiled. \"We'll get there, safe and sound,\" I said.\
  \ \"Trust me, I crossed the Atlantic twice.\""
