Text: "After passing through such amazing places such as Goa, I reached this hidden\
  \ gem of a place called Gokarna. It was my first solo trip and I was nervous and\
  \ excited at the same time. I made a friend on the way and did a lot of chatter.\
  \ I reached the Hostel where I was to stay only to find such nice amazingly talented\
  \ folks. A girl who was a painter. Together with her, we drew some wonderful paintings\
  \ of the walls of the hostel. I am now a part of history because of her. I then\
  \ rented a bike and started exploring the surroundings. Amidst all this, I got lost\
  \ only to find the true me. The me, who was scared as hell, but who enjoys every\
  \ situation and knows that he will come out of it soon. Gokarna is famous for its\
  \ beaches and one of the waves gave me a near heart attack. It was again a really\
  \ scary moment which prompted me to think that one should always be cautious of\
  \ the surroundings. What happened was that while walking along the beach, suddenly\
  \ a huge wave came and I was stuck between the wave and a giant rock. I could not\
  \ run away from the wave and I could have been swept away with the wave if I wasn't\
  \ lucky. I met a bunch of girls who were traveling in group. I faced my worst fear\
  \ of rejection when I started to talk to them but they completely ignored me. It\
  \ made me realise that one cannot hit it off with everyone. I even was caught by\
  \ the police for carrying beer can in my backpack near the religious centres. I\
  \ almost shit my pants when the police asked me to stop. But thank God, they were\
  \ kind to me. One of the nights, I ventured into the dark with two people I just\
  \ met and went with them into a cave. That was one hell of a time as I had absolutely\
  \ no clue of the way back had I been abandoned by them. We went inside the cave\
  \ to see a Saint sitting with almost no clothes. Our hearts had come in our hands\
  \ but we didn't scream. Who know what would have happened had the Saint woken up\
  \ and opened his eyes. \nFinally the trip ended, but it was a beginning of an endless\
  \ number of solo trips. I had so much fun and at the same faced a lot of my fears.\
  \ I guess it made a better person. Hence I really am traveling the world to improve\
  \ me. \U0001F60A"
