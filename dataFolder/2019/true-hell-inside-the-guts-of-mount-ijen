Text: "During my trip around South East Asia, I have been to magical places: some\
  \ of them were really beautiful whereas others were really dark. One of those places\
  \ is Mount Ijen, in Indonesia, in East Java province, close to the nearby town of\
  \ Banyuwangi. Just like the miners, I arrived at the mount's base at one in the\
  \ morning, without sleeping a single hour, after sleeping less than three hours\
  \ per day during the last five days. On the first fifty steps, I realised the trekking\
  \ was going to be much tougher than the steep walk to the summit of Mount Kelimutu\
  \ and definitely harder than the dessert walk to the summit of Mount Bromo. The\
  \ trail to the mine seems like a pilgrimage to Mecca: hundreds numbly march to their\
  \ goal, disregarding the cold weather, the gradient or the height which, at 1,900\
  \ meters above sea level, wreaks havoc on the pilgrims.\n\nThe beginning at such\
  \ a strange time does not only have a scenic reason (admire the sunrise from the\
  \ mountain's summit), but a much deeper reason: to make it in time to be able to\
  \ catch a sight of the magnificent blue flame, that burns until five in the morning.\
  \ Miners, in the meantime, extract the valuable sulphur that will feed their families\
  \ and that will inexorably drive them to premature death, slowly but steadily. After\
  \ a rugged climb to the summit, the descent into the centre of the crater begins,\
  \ and the trail becomes even more complicated: a narrow path with loose rocks, sulphur\
  \ powder and fear guide me towards the blue flame with its hypnotic movement.\n\n\
  On the way up, the smell of sulphur is eerie, unbearable: it penetrates into the\
  \ deepest parts of the organism, it seeps through every slot, through the nose,\
  \ through the eyes, through the skin pores. Once you start descending into the crater,\
  \ the smell of sulphur turns the air unbreathable \u2014even for the lucky ones\
  \ who wear a mask gas\u2014. Youngsters carry less weight: 65 kilos. Adults between\
  \ 25 and 32 years old are the most productive: 100 kilos. After that age, productivity\
  \ considerably decreases due to the physical deterioration of the miners: again,\
  \ 65 kilos.\n\nI returned from the mountain at seven in the morning, destroyed on\
  \ the inside and on the outside: my legs did not respond and my heart demanded explanations\
  \ I did not have. I asked Ben, our host in Banyuwangi, owner of a small homestay\
  \ located in the foothills of the mountain, if he could help me solve the muddle\
  \ I have in my head. Even though my throat and my eyes were sore because of the\
  \ sulphur, I sat down with my notepad and I questioned Ben for three long hours.\
  \ How did this all start? Who lit hell's flame? Why? With heartbreaking honesty,\
  \ he explained everything. There was so much passion in his words that I had to\
  \ hide my tears away.\n\nMiners cannot pay the medical treatments, so, hopelessly,\
  \ they die young due to lung diseases or because the strength they use to carry\
  \ the sulphur compresses their guts. They cannot either pay their studies, ipso\
  \ facto, they cannot break away from the vicious cycle they inherited. The Chinese\
  \ company that won the bid loads the sulphur in the mountain base but nobody knows\
  \ what they do with it. Ben confessed me that this was the first time that somebody\
  \ asked him about the miners lives: the other tourists go unnoticed through the\
  \ volcano. I want to dedicate these lines to Ben's father, who died at the age of\
  \ 54, and to Ben, who, with an inexplicable courage, fights against its mining heritage.\
  \ He was lucky enough to avoid an inevitably tragic future, but many of his friends\
  \ were not, and day after day, with a smile on their face, they walk in procession\
  \ to hell's crater."
