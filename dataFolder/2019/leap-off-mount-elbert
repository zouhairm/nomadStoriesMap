Text: "14,439 feet, the height of Mount Elbert, the height of my own dread of this\
  \ peak, would not have differed by much.  Located in a small town of Leadville,\
  \ this mountain witnessed several, few tamed the feat while more than many failed.\
  \ Four of us started from Denver to write our story, to achieve the number, 14439.\
  \ Some called it \u201CThe Colorado summit\u201D, few \u201CFourteeners\u201D, and\
  \ others \u201CSecond in the lower 48\u201D. The snow-capped giant was waiting with\
  \ its arms spread as we started the ascent. \n \tThe sun was shining bright red\
  \ and had beaten us again in the disciple of getting up. We planned to reach the\
  \ summit before noon, as mighty storms were predicted around that time. I lost my\
  \ group moments after the climb, but I felt complete by myself, relived with every\
  \ incremental step. With a determination, I am mocked for in my circles, I made\
  \ a promise to finish the summit before dusk. \n        Mount Elbert was to churn\
  \ my body today for every inch of its defeat, it got steeper as if by a cruel plot\
  \ against me. I saw the look of resignation in the old climber\u2019s eyes and knew\
  \ I had my age to my backing. I was deep in pain, rejoicing the strain one second\
  \ and cursing myself the very next. In this tug of war, I finally reached the tree\
  \ line- to see a summit but only to realize minutes later- The false ones always\
  \ come before the real. I started with all my might again, only to find myself break\
  \ down at another point. Never before, has this degree of pusillanimity, engulfed\
  \ me. A thought of returning back sent shivers down my spine. I was not ready for\
  \ that sense of defeat. The cold winds enfeebled me further. The steepest section\
  \ of the mountain was attained. Even this success couldn\u2019t evict the fleeting\
  \ thoughts of resignation and defeat but back in my mind, I ran the trust of my\
  \ loved ones. I crossed four false summits only to be awestruck at the top of the\
  \ second highest mountain of States; I was completely shaken by that point. Meanwhile,\
  \ the dark clouds were hovering up in the sky to give a clear indication of an imminent\
  \ thunderstorm, but the summit was too beautiful to miss. I scaled up only to experience\
  \ the most spectacular feeling.\nI was all by myself bounded by the huge peaks of\
  \ Mt. Elbert\u2014the most gratifying experience till date. My circle had now verifiable\
  \ reasons to mock my determination. I guess, happiness doesn\u2019t always need\
  \ company. \nA part of my soul had dived from the peak of Mt. Elbert. I was not\
  \ the same back home. Mount Elbert returned to me again, but this time it was more\
  \ on the abscissa\u2014the farthest archipelago and the southernmost tip of US,\
  \ Keywest. \nFrom forming a connection with people from 11 different nations to\
  \ travelling by 6 different modes of transportation, Keywest was eclectic. Jonathan,\
  \ the truck driver from Belgium, an amazing raconteur, joined by Paula, a consultant\
  \ from the country of Georgia, and I shared our wandering experiences in Snorkeling\
  \ cruise and decided on a random plan to Parasail in Wisteria. The romantic sunset\
  \ in Mallory square engulfed us in its beauty before we waved each other adieu\u2019\
  s. The evening led up to meeting my host, Mike, a boat captain who took me in his\
  \ dinghy to the farthest waters. He stopped where the Gulf of Mexico meets the Atlantic.\
  \ We were closer to Cuba than to the States. The night was spent in a boat where\
  \ I could see the moon crossing the horizon from left to right. This was one of\
  \ the most beautiful nights I ever spent. Waking up in the literal meaning of \u201C\
  Middle of nowhere\u201D was an astonishing feeling. The captain brought me back\
  \ to the land and gave his bike for the next day to see his pretty city. Ernest\
  \ Hemingway museum with its cats and Keywest Lighthouse witnessed yet another leap\
  \ in me as an explorer. As a traveler, it hit me then, that the longer I wander,\
  \ the wider my horizon grows. A true leap into the unknown-self!"
