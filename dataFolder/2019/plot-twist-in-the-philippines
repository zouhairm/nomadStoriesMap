Text: "For a while I have dreamt of visiting the Philippines as I have met so many\
  \ amazing Filipinos and have heard how genuine the people were. Needless to say,\
  \ the country did not disappoint in authenticity and excitement during my trip.\
  \ After over a year in New Zealand and Australia, and over two months traveling\
  \ Southeast Asia, I was ready for a new experience and I was sure going to get one\
  \ during my three weeks there. \nAbout a week and a half into my trip, I spent a\
  \ few days in Moalboal, and decided to go see Kawasan Falls. When the accident happened,\
  \ I was on the second level of the falls and I knew right away that I was not able\
  \ to walk on my leg.\_I am not likely to forget these falls anytime soon that\xB4\
  s for sure. Let\u2019s just say that it involved me and a rock, and the rock clearly\
  \ won leaving me with a fractured bone. \nI was lucky to have friendly faces I had\
  \ met trying to help and cheer me up, but I was in rough shape.\nI was in so much\
  \ pain from the moment it happened and knew I needed to go to a hospital. On my\
  \ second attempt to reach a hospital with an x-ray machine, I was forced to get\
  \ to Cebu to find a hospital that could help me. The three hour car ride was one\
  \ of the most painful drives of my life and when I arrived in Cebu I went directly\
  \ to the hospital to get checked out.\nWithin fifteen minutes of arriving, I got\
  \ an x-ray, learnt that my leg was fractured and had a cast on. From that moment,\
  \ I was slowly realizing that my whole trip had changed and that I was now alone\
  \ in a foreign country with a BROKEN bone. Oh shit.\nThis accident happened and\
  \ I was having to adjust my plans according.\nI learnt this lesson the difficult\
  \ way during my travels in the Philippines.\nAt least I had insurance and they really\
  \ helped me out, even just checking up with me while I was in the hospital and calling\
  \ me frequently to make sure I was doing alright.\nAfter spending a week sat up\
  \ in Cebu I was cleared to fly back to Canada to stay with my parents and properly\
  \ heal my fracture. \_It was a very difficult time, and a hard decision when I had\
  \ a flight back to Australia for April. I had been very set on returning down under\
  \ and continuing to live the life of adventures and travel.\nI ended up taking four\
  \ flights to get back to Canada, and it was a horrible mess but I made it in one\
  \ piece (if you don\xB4t count the fracture in my right ankle).\nAfter my first\
  \ flight I quickly understood why they don\u2019t advice you to fly with a recently\
  \ broken bone; I have never been in so much pain. \_To top it off, right before\
  \ my long flight from Taiwan to Toronto, the guy helping to push me around in a\
  \ wheelchair hit my leg so hard against the wall. The whole flight I was in a lot\
  \ of pain and just wanted to be home.\nOnce I arrived back home, I was thrilled\
  \ to see family and friends but sadly my arrival was not under the circumstances\
  \ I had imagined my first days back home to be.\nRegardless of my injury, the Philippines\
  \ was the most authentic experience I had while in Southeast Asia and I still left\
  \ the country wanting to one day return under better circumstances.\nThe people\
  \ are genuinely happy and joyfuly;\_I would push anyone to go enjoy the country,\
  \ the beaches and the friendly faces. \_I am fairly certain I will return one day\
  \ because I cannot leave such a remarkable country on such a bittersweet note.\n\
  As for my fear of non adventure, well today I find myself having moved on. I am\
  \ living in Sevilla, Spain on the other side of the world and my fractured leg adventure\
  \ feels like a lifetime ago; A little distance and a lot of adventure make everything\
  \ better."
