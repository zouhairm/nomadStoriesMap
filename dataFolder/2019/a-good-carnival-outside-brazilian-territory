Text: "Everybody knows the Brazilian Carnival in Rio with just too much samba, big\
  \ parades and beautiful women dancing all night long.\nTherefore I happened to arrive\
  \ at a city in the middle of Germany where carnival is as lively as the Brazilian\
  \ one, but just a few people have heard about it.\n The Carnival in Cologne was\
  \ buzzing with festival performances and events. It began on November 11th at 11:11\
  \ a.m. but the climax of Carnival, called crazy days, do not start before the so-called\
  \ Shrove Thursday, the Thursday before the big official Rose Monday Parade (Rosenmontag\
  \ in German). \nThe Carnival Festival Commitee has been planning the celebration\
  \ for months, and everything was organized into the deepest details. Besides, there\
  \ were huge amount of police cars in the city, and everything went quite peaceful\
  \ protected by police from all around the country (they went from other cities to\
  \ Cologne to help out the local police).\n Those days are celebrated with parties\
  \ on the streets, in public squares and also in pubs. In Cologne, costumes are almost\
  \ essential, everyone is wearing their costumes, although I was not wearing one.\
  \ To be honest, I felt a bit stranger in the midst of everyone in costume but that\
  \ did not spoil my carnival in any way. I had as much as fun than any other one\
  \ there.\nOn Thursday, the first crazy day, I could see ladies in fancy dress on\
  \ their way to the office, to shops or anywhere else. It's called Women's Carnival\
  \ Day in honor to all women.\nThe following two days are fulled with masked balls\
  \ and parties, parties and more parties inside pubs and nightclubs. The music is\
  \ also mixed with songs from different countries, and incidentally I could hear\
  \ a famous Brazilian song. That may happen because lots of foreigners go there to\
  \ celebrate with locals.\nBut the most important day is the Rose Monday with the\
  \ big, official parade organized by the Cologne Carnival Festival Committee, it's\
  \ the largest Carnival parade in Germany. It is also a colorful spectacle with thousands\
  \ of people in fancy dress and big cars representing very important issues such\
  \ as political and environmental ones, like plastic pollution, which is a global\
  \ tragedy for our ocean and sealife. \nBesides that, people in those cars sings\
  \ the local songs, waves to the onlookers and also throws chocolates and flowers\
  \ to them, while the crowds are yelling \"Str\xFC\xDFjer\" (which means flowers)\
  \ or \"Kamelle (which means chocolates). \nIn the end, people usually carry bags\
  \ of \"Kamelle\" with a weight of a couple of kilos.\nTuesday is the last day of\
  \ the Cologne Carnival. There are a few smaller parades occurring in local Cologne\
  \ neighborhoods and the main event is the ceremonial burning of the Nubbels. Nubbel\
  \ is a doll symbolizing all of the sins that may have been committed in the preceding\
  \ days of Carnival season. The Nubbels are symbolically burnt, which rids everyone\
  \ from their carnival sins. The Burning of Nubbel ceremony officially symbolizes\
  \ the end of Cologne Carnival.\nHowever, I could realize that on Tuesday most people\
  \ walk through the city carrying suitcases on their way to take the metro and go\
  \ home. And I was a part of them. Besides carrying our bags, we also carried smiles\
  \ and memories of a wonderful Carnival that we will never forget."
