Text: "We have come to Syria - my wife, her father, and I \u2013 in search of our\
  \ relatives. This was before the civil war. Before my country decided all Syrians\
  \ were terrorists. All we have to go on are three letters sent over 60 years ago.\
  \ They are in Arabic. We cannot read them and hand them over to Fayez, the cousin\
  \ of a friend of ours in America, who has agreed to help us. \u201CIt is my duty\u201D\
  \ he says. \n\nFayez is a handsome man \u2013 salt and pepper hair, a bushy mustache,\
  \ a weathered smile. He reads the letters and frowns. \u201CThis is very sad. He\
  \ writes from jail. He has no money. His family has no food. He says \u2018Please\
  \ not forget us\u2019.\u201D The letters come from Najeeb Naddour, postmarked from\
  \ a village that Fayez knows. He claps his hands together. \"Now we have something,\"\
  \ he says. \"We will find your family. We will catch them.\"\n\nFayez lives in the\
  \ Valley of the Christians. About 11% of the population in Syria is Christian, most\
  \ of the rest Muslim. His home is spacious, with a large sitting area, a family\
  \ room, a dining area. The room d\xE9cor looks like something from the \u201860s.\
  \ There is a TV for watching CNN, a stereo for listening to Western and Arabic music.\
  \ From his porch, you can see Krak de Chevaliers, a massive fortress built in the\
  \ 12th century to guard the valley. \n\nFayez is helping us on his day off. He is\
  \ an ambulance driver and general handyman for the Al Housen Patriarchic Hospital.\
  \ The hospital has 56 beds and serves 100,000 people, both Muslim and Christian.\
  \ They turn no one away. Fayez works six days a week, and is on-call for ambulance\
  \ duty 24 hours a day. He is glad to have the work, to serve his community. For\
  \ this, he earns $240 a month. \n\nWe are anxious to begin our quest, but first\
  \ there is tea. In Syria, every endeavor begins with tea. It is a civilized ritual,\
  \ one we have come to enjoy. We finish and finally head off to the village where\
  \ the letters came from. Fayez stops a workman on the street. \u201CWhere is the\
  \ house of the oldest living member of the Naddour family?\u201D The man points\
  \ up the hill. We drive to the house and a man answers. Fayez tells him our story.\
  \ He is sorry. He isn't our relative, but he knows the family we are looking for.\
  \ They live in the next village down the road. He invites us to coffee. His wife\
  \ brings out biscuits and sweet Arabic coffee. He tells us about his orchard, his\
  \ children, then sends us on our way with a bag full of crisp apples.\n\nIn the\
  \ next village, Fayez knows we are close; he can smell the scent. He asks a man\
  \ sitting outside a storefront for the house of Naddour. The man points across the\
  \ street. We knock on the door and a young woman answers. She seems hesitant, uncertain\
  \ what we want. Fayez tells our story, showing her the letters, and she softens.\
  \ Yes, she smiles, she is the granddaughter of Najeeb, the man who wrote these letters\
  \ some sixty years ago. This is her father Wajeeh\u2019s house. This is where she,\
  \ her father, and her grandfather were born. Fayez smiles now. \"I am very happy.\
  \ It is beautiful thing to bring family together.\" He uses the phone to call Wajeeh,\
  \ who lives in Damascus, and arranges a meeting for the following day. \n\nSo we\
  \ gather again at Fayez\u2019s home in the Valley of the Christians. Wajeeh makes\
  \ the three-hour bus trip from Damascus. Edward, my father-in-law, takes the one-hour\
  \ taxi ride from our hotel in Hama. And there, under the watchful eye of the crusader\
  \ fortress, the Naddour cousins meet for the first time in their lives. Tears run\
  \ down their faces as they embrace and kiss each other\u2019s cheeks. Wajeeh knows\
  \ no English. Edward speaks only a few words of Arabic. But that doesn\u2019t matter.\
  \ Fayez waits to one side, ready to translate whatever words they might find."
