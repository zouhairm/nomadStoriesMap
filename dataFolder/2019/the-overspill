Text: "The sweat is pouring down my back.  I\u2019m clinging to my bright, plastic\
  \ water bottle as it is a priceless artifact; the metallic blue sheen reflecting\
  \ off the mesh coop that envelopes the horizon.\nThe smell is all consuming; the\
  \ gutters flowing with waste, the swell of people and the fear that I might be knocked\
  \ into that filthy snake of stinking water. Little shanty caf\xE9\u2019s in shacks,\
  \ jaundiced bananas and oranges being flogged from the back of a van.  The putrid\
  \ smell of rubbish catching in my throat.\nAn overwhelming feeling that I am covered\
  \ in filth. We have arrived at the camp.\n\u201CWelcome to Moria Prison\u201D in\
  \ graffiti scrawled on the high walls.  \nWe decide to climb up a hill parallel\
  \ to see the landscape of Moria.  Here it is quieter than usual amongst the myriad\
  \ of human noise.  A vast, metal shanty town like boxes.  Boxes and boxes like Tupperware.\
  \  A giant, metal tetris game.\n\nI arrived in Lesbos, Greece to record a podcast\
  \ with a friend about the solidarity movement taking place on the island.  No amount\
  \ of research could have prepared me for the scenes of the Moria refugee camp.\n\
  \  \nA face, a wave - we spot a man standing in the furthest corner of the camp\
  \ enclosure.  He tries German, Greek, French, before reaching English.  He chastises\
  \ my lack of languages.  He is Algerian.  He and my friend talk and I feel like\
  \ a useless doll, unable to join in, unable to articulate.  I can only see the large,\
  \ metal fence keeping him enclosed as he chats about everyday things.  \nAs he laughs,\
  \ jokes; I\u2019m astounded that after eight months trapped in this cage, he doesn\u2019\
  t scream in my face.  It dawns on me in that moment; that this is a place where\
  \ people grasp any kind of joy they can, that a friendly face and a mundane chat\
  \ is a privilege.  Suffering beside someone is not the same as choosing to stand\
  \ there in solidarity.  \n\nWe wait in a queue to escape this place.  There is a\
  \ group of men next to me; assessing my pale, Irish pallor.  My shaking hands. \
  \ A careening bus veers towards us finally, as the men are jostling their younger\
  \ friend to push ahead, to skip the queue - he catches my eye and lets me on first.\
  \  Societal convention in the most unlikely of places, humanity in those that experience\
  \ the least of it.   \n\nOn this unsteady bus, there is a baby girl, a toddler in\
  \ a buggy - the men start to engage with her; entertaining her with pulled expressions,\
  \ booping her nose, pretending to take her croissant.\nOne of the more dominant\
  \ group members pays so much care and attention to her, never takes his gaze off\
  \ her - there is so much longing in his expression, I\u2019m transfixed.\nI can\u2019\
  t help speculating about a child he has lost, or wanted to have - the unknown, faceless\
  \ child. \nThis then, is the essence of what one feels in Lesbos.  It is an island\
  \ of lost things; an earthly limbo where the most valuable commodity is hope.\n\
  The beauty of this place lies in the people that reside here, the constant struggle\
  \ to affect change, the raw humanity displayed in every demonstration.\nProtests\
  \ here are filled with the jangled chorus of Greek folk songs, the clicks of shared\
  \ lighters, and a multitude of languages and accents.  \n\nI did not expect this\
  \ struggle to be so beautiful.  The speed with which my daily mindset switches from\
  \ not deserving to enjoy this place; to a need to renounce my western life of coffee\
  \ and overpriced conversation, and permanently move is dizzying.  The atmosphere\
  \ is intoxicating, adrenaline is tangible in the air here.  This island of Lesbos\
  \ is a world unto itself. \n\nIt\u2019s only as the bus pulls away to leave Moria,\
  \ that I notice all the metal containers say UNHCR.\nThe blankets, the fences, even\
  \ the dilapidated cardboard boxes which people are living in outside the walls of\
  \ the camp.  \u201CThe Overspill\u201D it is called.  It is made by us."
