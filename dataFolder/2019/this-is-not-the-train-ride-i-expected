Text: "This is not the train ride I expected. \n*\nPeople keep trooping into the train\
  \ through the door entrances and soon all the access points become clogged with\
  \ humans. Now people are jumping in through the tiny windows like locusts, head\
  \ followed by the rest of the body. A mother pushes her infant daughter into our\
  \ hands through the window from outside. The mother struggles to follow the daughter\
  \ in through the same route, but her tummy gets in the way. Her head and hands have\
  \ reached into the train but her legs are flailing outside. We are startled, with\
  \ a wailing baby in our hands and the head of a woman pushing and straining like\
  \ a lunatic trying to unite with her lost child. \nThe train shudders, ready to\
  \ move. The mother is still trapped. The wailing of the child increases by another\
  \ notch. We plead and plead to the head of the mother to let her feet go back and\
  \ rest on solid ground, take her child and abort this reckless mission. The mother\
  \ does not relent. She has not reached this far to give up; her eyes still urge\
  \ her body to fight more. Now the train is moving, slowly in a crawl, honking a\
  \ final warning. The mother now knows, it is game over. She drops back on her feet\
  \ and we pass her child into her arms and even this strong mother is fighting back\
  \ sobs.\nFor the first time I notice the real contents of this metallic rattling\
  \ coach. It is a carrier of bubble of humans, men, women, children, matted bags,\
  \ glistening silver buckets, wrapped bundles of brooms, prickly tubers of yams competing\
  \ for leg space, creaking assemblage of overhead fans, backpacks, wrapped nylon\
  \ leathers, passengers on seats, standing, hanging on shoulders of seats, heads\
  \ lying on the walking aisle. The journey from Kaduna to Abeokuta is just beginning\
  \ but we are tired faces.\nThe train is not just a rushing metal, but an array of\
  \ colours \u2013 silver buckets, brown brooms, yellow and red clothes, blue, red,\
  \ and white matted bags \u2013 smiles, stretch marks, yawns, cries. It is a dizzy\
  \ picture of a receding sun, total darkness, fans attached to the roof of a train\
  \ whirling, snores of humans and dripping sweats.\nI tilt my camera headlong and\
  \ photograph the train take a bend on the track, so that our coach is in direct\
  \ view of another part of the train. It is a long train, each coach attached to\
  \ the other like marching soldiers. I take a snapshot, and the image caught makes\
  \ me return back to my seat. Click, click, click. I hear the shutter sounds and\
  \ my mind processes the images. Outside, just above us on all the coaches, there\
  \ are masses of humans standing, sitting, squatting, and lying down on top of the\
  \ train like daredevils. They improvise risky positions and create their open-air\
  \ coaches, just above us. We are riding. They are flying.\nThe train breaks down\
  \ in the middle of nowhere. I pick the camera. There are no more passengers clinging\
  \ on the top of the train, Minna must have been the final destination for daredevils.\
  \ Outside, the mists of the morning are still falling. The train is surrounded by\
  \ a view of domineering hills covered in grasses and clouds, and we are stuck within\
  \ their valleys. Women drag children, pour water into their mouths, brush their\
  \ teeth and rinse faces. Skirts lift, trousers drop and urine directed at dewy grasses.\
  \ \nI wander around and aim the camera. The lens captures a boy, about five years,\
  \ in a school uniform, a hand knitted blue cardigan embroidered with an initial\
  \ to the chest side: S.T.J. He is viewing the surrounding through the windows, his\
  \ eyes yearning to disobey warnings and instructions, to be able to feel life outside\
  \ the metallic containers. A younger toddler is by his side, tiptoeing, only his\
  \ eyes are visible through the window slit. I take a snapshot.\n*\nThis is not the\
  \ train ride I expected, but stories hunt us gasping."
