Text: "First Day In Boat\n\nHaving born in the southern part of the country, I have\
  \ never seen a vast water container until i visited the western cost of the country\
  \ near Democratic Republic of Congo to watch the Lake Kivu. I was very curious as\
  \ any other professional journalist seeking very knowledge to meet his/her curiosity\
  \ so that he/ she got the story to share other. By going to the very place, we crossed\
  \ the very huge forest in the country now a touristic place, NYUNGWE Forest National\
  \ Park. This special forest has got species I have been wishing to see with my eyes\
  \ like chimpanzee and others strange birds. It was a special moment for me satisfying\
  \ my curiosity. After having driven off more than four hours from the capital city\
  \ Kigali, to experience the great lake in the country at the border of DR Congo,\
  \ I saw metal and wooden material in form of wooden bowl known as Umuvure in local\
  \ language.  The carrier I called wooden bowl later on my colleague whose family\
  \ lived near the suburb of the lake in Eastern Part of the country pointed at it\
  \ calling the boat, and I got surprised as it was my first time to catch an eye\
  \ on it. The one with Engine behind in iron materials of the Marine soldiers, had\
  \ life jackets in soldier green colors they gave to put on.  without hesitation,\
  \ we put on the jackets and get inside the boat with men and women marine who were\
  \ ready to give help  in any case the newly boat goers sunk.  Staring at the water\
  \ behind the sliding boat over the greatest lake in the country heading to the Island\
  \ of IWAWA in midst f the lake where drug dealers and delinquent\u2019s young people\
  \ are kept for rehabilitation f six months to 2years. Boating  an hour and a half\
  \ journey with marine forces in their possession of the location , was a wonderful\
  \ experience for the first traveler by boat."
