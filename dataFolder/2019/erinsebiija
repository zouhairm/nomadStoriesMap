Text: "The rickety racket of the bus as it moved on the uneven slope of the road brought\
  \ me back from la la land as the vehicle jerked back and forth. I must have been\
  \ more tired than I cared to admit I thought to myself. Moreover,  this had begun\
  \ to look like a journey to the ends of the earth with the unending scape of bushes\
  \ and trees in view on both sides of the road. \nI had never seen so many mud houses\
  \ in the same place.\nHere, the day drags. You would wonder many times in a minute\
  \ how people ever got anything done before technology.\nThe night life here is different,\
  \ felt different too. It would have been dead silent, except the lack of power called\
  \ for substitute. Civilization wasn't entirely lost on them as nobody screeched\
  \ when the alternative for power came on. In exchange for the light, the peace and\
  \ quiet seemed like a  small price to pay. I thought about the neighbors, would\
  \ they think the same? As selfish as it might sound, I was glad for the illumination\
  \ despite the neighbors and regardless of what they might feel or not feel.\nNot\
  \ much is to be noticed here in the morning. I couldn't remember hearing a cock\
  \ crow, the odour of the local goats were strong enough to say \"good morning\"\
  . This area feels strange. Apart from the vast green land and mountains, it's almost\
  \ quiet. I watched for birds but couldn't find. It was almost as if they were in\
  \ hiding. \nFor people who didn't have much, these people sure didn't crave much\
  \ either. They embraced their simplicity. The villagers were friendly people. They\
  \ stare, a lot and long enough though. Can't say I blame them as it was evident\
  \ that this community was intertwined and visitors didn't come along often, if at\
  \ all.\nPhones were basically useless except for music, reading and maybe games\
  \ as there wasn't a single network connection.\nThe village chief who had accepted\
  \ and saw to us being comfortable brought a lad to help with translation. He couldn't\
  \ be more than eighteen. We called him \xC8r\xEDnseb\xED\xECj\xE0. At least, that\
  \ was the name he had been introduced by. He was of great help. His spoken English\
  \ was quite impressive and we silently wondered how he ended up here as there were\
  \ no schools and the nearest was about three hours drive away. It certainly did\
  \ not take him long to put us out of our misery. He told us about himself, life\
  \ as an only child in the city, having to move to the village six years earlier\
  \ after his parents died because no one wanted the burden of a \"cursed child\"\
  . He spoke of a time of surplus and having lived. He spoke of plans to move back\
  \ to the big city if \"grandpa died soon\". His cheerful spirit rubbed off on our\
  \ lot making our job easier and more enjoyable.\nVolunteering could be a hard thing\
  \ at times. Meeting new people is tough work. Trying to correct convictions about\
  \ set ways is harder. We talked about reusable pads, distributed tons. We made them\
  \ aware about HIV and how it could be prevented. We did what we could. \nI heard\
  \ a team member murmur out a question, \"what happens when these pads finish?\"\
  \ Another pointed out that they were reusable. We all laughed, enjoying each other's\
  \ banter but fully aware that even though the spoils of civilization wasn't lost\
  \ on these ones, civilization or actual resemblance to it was a long time coming,\
  \ after all, even in our tees and jeans we looked over-dressed. We had decided here\
  \ on sheer luck, we will be back.\nFinally back to civilization, the emptiness.\
  \ Right now, I just want to sleep and dream of the mountain parts I'm never going\
  \ to miss. Or would I? As I drifted off and \xC8r\xEDnseb\xED\xECj\xE0 happy go\
  \ lucky smile crept up on me, I knew I wouldn't be forgetting the parts in a while.\n\
  Smiling to myself, my last coherent thought was \"What kind of parents name their\
  \ child '\xC8r\xEDnseb\xED\xECj\xE0'?\" The direct translation being \"Laughter\
  \ seems like rivalry\"."
