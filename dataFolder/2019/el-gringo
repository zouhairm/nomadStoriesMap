Text: "El Gringo\n\nThe large black metal mural of Che and formations of soldiers\
  \ marching in the sunlight were reminiscent of the war movies I had grew up on.\
  \ My camera tried to sneak a photo but the commanders wagging finger reminded me\
  \ that this place was not safe nor free. As I slowly made my way through the cobble\
  \ streets of Havana it was like I had been transported back in time. Images popped\
  \ in my mind of the Pink Ladies and the soundtrack of Grease Lightning played in\
  \ my head. \n\nOur bus quickly sped through the streets and past the Colon Cemetery\
  \ which was awe inspiring all in its own. The marble statues looked like they raised\
  \ up from the ground in their search to reach the heavens. \n\nAs we approached\
  \ our destination my stomach quickly tied in knots thinking of exploring these back\
  \ streets where protests could and often would ignite in seconds. My mind quickly\
  \ reminded me that the goal highly outweighed the dangers. My husband and I had\
  \ had came in search of a hidden treasure; The Old Gringo. \n\nAs the sun slowly\
  \ dipped below the clouds the street was completely empty and the only noise were\
  \ our footsteps and the hint of Cuban music being played a few streets over. When\
  \ we had searched for what seemed like forever, an old man slowly appeared from\
  \ the shadows. His skin was sun kissed brown and the lines on his face showed that\
  \ his life had been anything but easy. He slowly shuffled his way closer, His fedora\
  \ covering part of his eyes and his cigar hanging haphazardly from his lips. \n\n\
  My mind shouted run but my legs seemed to be cemented to the ground. The old man\
  \ slowly leaned forward and whispered the words I will forever remember\u2026\u2026\
  ..El Gringo? As the shock wore off, I slowly nodded yes. \n\nWe walked towards an\
  \ old house with a creaky staircase leading to the basement. I was certain that\
  \ through the doors there was a drug cartel waiting to  ransom us to the Canadian\
  \ government. Surprisingly what I found through the doors was anything but breathtaking.\
  \ The room was filled with a dozen tables and vaulted ceilings where vines and plants\
  \ seemed to grow in every space and corner. Walls were covered with green street\
  \ name signs and framed photographs of actors, actresses and even American Presidents\
  \ who had visited this eatery. \n\nSmells from the kitchen enveloped my senses and\
  \ made my mouth water. I felt almost at home. The cozy atmosphere, music and laughter\
  \ made me feel guilty for ever fearing this place. The food did not disappoint;\
  \ creole spices mixed with lobster, shrimp and chicken. Vegetables so fresh that\
  \ they seemed like they were just picked from the garden minutes before. Even the\
  \ mojitos tasted different, like they were invented and perfected here. \n\nAs the\
  \ night wore on we knew we had to leave this sanctuary. Our shared smiles and kisses\
  \ between courses reminded us that this place would always be ours and would forever\
  \ be a cherished memory."
