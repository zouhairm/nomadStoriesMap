Text: "I\u2019ve landed in Beirut at sunset.\n\xABBienvenue au pays des contrastes\xBB\
  . Welcome to the land of contrasts, says my friend picking me up at the airport.\
  \ Lebanese living in Paris, a few years younger than me, looking like someone that\
  \ lived many more, he\u2019s one of the chasers of the European dream.\nHe starts\
  \ making plans for the week. There is so much here to see, and apparently I have\
  \ to do it in one week, before he leaves the country to go back to la belle France.\n\
  \xABWhy are you doing all this?\xBB I ask. We don\u2019t really know each other,\
  \ we just have a friend in common. C\u2019est l\u2019adhiafa libanaise, the lebanese\
  \ hospitality.\nWe pass through the southern area of the city. \xABThis is Hezbollah\u2019\
  s land, the shi\u2019a area\xBB, he explains. \xABBut don\u2019t worry, we will\
  \ be soon in the area \"un peu plus classe\"\xBB. I don\u2019t really understand\
  \ the exact meaning of \"classe\", but those decadent buildings, with bare wires\
  \ and Arabic writing that I\u2019m still not able to read properly, are very close\
  \ to what I would define home.\n\"Next Christmas ring a different bell\", says a\
  \ huge poster, promising new fancy apartments ready before the end of the month.\
  \ Suddenly, the bare wires and old buildings make way to shiny skyscrapers, lights\
  \ and Starbucks caf\xE9s.\nIn the blink of an eye, the old familiar world is gone\
  \ and a new, arrogant, western-like Beirut stands out in front of me.\n\xABTu parles\
  \ arabe? Tahki arabi?\xBB \xABChouai\xBB, a bit. My five-months stay in Jordan helped\
  \ me to understand basic conversations, deal with taxi drivers and buy stuff in\
  \ supermarkets.\nWell, all this here is useless. Lebanese people like to feel unique.\
  \ Everything they do, from sharing food to hanging the laundry out is done, in their\
  \ opinion, \xE0 la libanaise. And, of course, they want to have their own language,\
  \ their own way to communicate, a sort of secret code to understand who\u2019s a\
  \ real lebanese and who\u2019s not.\n\xABShoukran, ma\u2019 salama\xBB I say to\
  \ the guy at the phone shop. \nHe laughs. My friend smiles, embarrassed.\n\xABIf\
  \ you say shoukran, he explains, they understand you are not from here\xBB - in\
  \ case blue eyes were not clear enough.\nHere we say \"merci\".\nBut not the french\
  \ \"mevci\", it\u2019s a \"merci\" \xE0 la libanaise, rolling the r. \nAt dinner,\
  \ we meet some people. All Lebanese, they introduce themselves with what I tought\
  \ is was just one of the clich\xE9s of this culture: \xABHi, kefeek, \xE7a va?\xBB\
  \ \xC7a va, I guess. They all went to the two prestigious Lebanese universities\
  \ that make the education system of the country something to be really proud of,\
  \ the American University of Beirut and Universit\xE9 Saint Joseph. Then, they completed\
  \ their studies in France. Some of them speak English, all the girls speak French.\n\
  \xABThey\u2019re frenchies\xBB, says my friend. Girls who speak French at home and\
  \ with their friends. They went to private Christian schools, where Arabic was not\
  \ a major subject and everything was taught in French.\nThey speak Arabic, he confesses,\
  \ but they started using it in France, so they could gossip about people without\
  \ being understood.\n\xABHere\u2019s my number, call me whenever you want, I speak\
  \ a good English\xBB, says the taxi driver dropping me off, after I gave him directions\
  \ in what I thought it was a good Arabic. During the ride, we listened to an Arabic\
  \ radio station. \xABYou\u2019re the first foreigner who asks for Arabic music,\
  \ you know. Here we like people who want to learn our culture, but also those who\
  \ don\u2019t want. We like everyone. Do you know some Arabic music?\xBB\nI went\
  \ to a Mashrou\u2019 Leila concert when I was in Jordan, I confess proudly. No reaction.\
  \ \xABYou have good music in your country, I don\u2019t understand a word, but I\
  \ like it. Ah, Italia! I have some Italian friends, benvenuto, come stai?\xBB goes\
  \ on the taxi driver. In this land of contrasts, carrefour of languages and cultures,\
  \ I feel like I will always be a foreigner, but never actually feeling a stranger:\
  \ in Lebanon, we are all home."
