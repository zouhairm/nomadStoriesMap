Text: "After a thirty-five hour trip, some expired Chinese plane food and countless\
  \ senseless jokes of my travel partner, I finally reached Phnom Penh. The joy of\
  \ the traveler soon started to kick inside me while I was looking through the window\
  \ of the taxi that was driving me to the hostel. My trip into the unknown was about\
  \ to be materialized since some job deadlines had made impossible the proper preparation\
  \ of the trip. \n\nA scenario characterized by small houses, an infinite line of\
  \ tuk-tuks and omnipresent coffee carts quickly contrasted with that of other modern\
  \ capital cities of the old Indochina region.  Despite the lack of self-preparation,\
  \ I decided to get stuck with my plan, exploring Cambodia and Laos with one of those\
  \ old Vietnamese motorbikes that somehow made it to Cambodia while the law still\
  \ allowed the adventurous souls to cross the border with them. \n\nAs the old school\
  \ dictates, the motorbike hunting started by talking to the locals which quickly\
  \ recommended a well-known second hand website. The communication with them in English\
  \ is far from being easy; nonetheless, their genuine hospitality, sense of humor\
  \ and openness to talk to foreigners quickly captivates and gives the traveler the\
  \ will to know who they are and their history. \n\nSince finding a motorbike that\
  \ met the 200 dollars budget was not easy, I had time to plan my trip and explore\
  \ the capital meanwhile some new advertisements appeared online as signs of god.\
  \ A sweet ice-coffee in the mornings after a soup of fresh rice noodles became the\
  \ staple morning energy shot required to start walking about. Visiting the local\
  \ markets was an experience in itself for the 5 senses. There, the ease to spot\
  \ traditional scarfs with which the locals cover their head is a constant reminder\
  \ of the indiscriminate brutality of the tropical sun. The vivid colors and smells\
  \ of the fruits being sold could trigger an organoleptic orgasm in any foodie and\
  \ the wide range of rice varieties in display act as a proxy for the possibilities\
  \ that the Khmer cuisine has to offer. In the market, the jewelry section also becomes\
  \ a hypnotic attraction for the eyes of any visitor due to the powerful flames and\
  \ expertise with which the artisans craft those shiny metallic artifacts. After\
  \ each visit to the market I stopped the roaring of my stomach caused by all the\
  \ visual and olfactory stimuli by treating it with some coconut rice pancakes, a\
  \ real delicacy. \n\nDespite the improvising nature of the start of my trip, my\
  \ interactions with the locals quickly pointed me in the direction of the S21 museum\
  \ and the killing fields to understand their recent history. There, the graphically\
  \ descriptive images and the information provided by an audio guide put anyone on\
  \ the shoes of the suffering Khemer population that passed through the genocidal\
  \ dictatorship of the Khemer Rouge.  Nonetheless, an astonishing recovery from the\
  \ 4 years ordeal is noticed in the streets due to strength, stamina and respectful\
  \ nature that characterize the DNA of the Cambodian people. \n\nIt is clear from\
  \ looking at the urban landscape that Cambodia is undergoing dramatic socio-economic\
  \ changes. In the river side, western standards of fashion get dissolved in traditional\
  \ Cambodian outfits.  Modern cafes lay next to local bars in which the prices are\
  \ a quarter of those of the former. At nights, bars for any sexual orientation become\
  \ an indicator of the tolerant direction to which the society is heading while the\
  \ uncontrolled red-light district is a reminder that there are still some improvements\
  \ to be done.  \n\nAfter 7 days in Phom Penh, my travel partner and me had already\
  \ found the motorbikes with which we would have a life changing travel we will never\
  \ forget. My experience in the capital would be just a glimpse of the fascinating\
  \ Khemer culture I would discover along the trip. Now, it was time to head south\
  \ and drive along the coast until the Chinese-dominated city of Shianokuville from\
  \ which I would go to the paradisiacal islands of Koh Rong and Koh Rong Sanloem.\
  \ It was a real leap into the unknown as I would later discover.\n\nAlejandro Espi"
