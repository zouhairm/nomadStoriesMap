Text: "Located on the banks of the Douro river, Porto fascinated through its history\
  \ \u2018in every tile\u2019 and conquered the heart of far-away travelers, through\
  \ its cuisine and the friendliness of its people. Since over 200 years, Porto was\
  \ already world famous for the fortified port wines made in the region. After Porto\
  \ being declared European City of Culture in 2001, tourism boom increased years\
  \ after years, backed by the Historic Center voted a UNESCO World Heritage Site\
  \ along with the riverside bairro of Ribeira. \nAfter arriving at Oporto airport\
  \ and a quick check-in at the hotel, I started my first steps of discoveries walking\
  \ around Porto\u2019s waterfront known as the Ribeira, alongside couples of all\
  \ ages, families, and group of friends, walking up and down the cobblestone streets\
  \ with picturesque steep houses clustered up hills. Pedestrian friendly roads lead\
  \ to hidden terraces, where I was mingling with locals and tourists who came to\
  \ enjoy the warm rays of the sun while sipping on Douro Valley wines or a wide selection\
  \ of Porto. A couple of days are enough to see the main attractions unless you are\
  \ a gourmet connoisseur like me and plan to visit several port wine lodges at Vila\
  \ Nova de Gaia, located just across the Rio Douro (River of Gold). The capital of\
  \ the North, which the poet Lu\xEDs de Cam\xF5es once christened as 'the eternal\
  \ name of Portugal', has experienced an artistic and creative renaissance in recent\
  \ years, thus becoming a cutting-edge city that boasts one of the most famous ports\
  \ and wines in the world.\nFor eating and going out, I was spoiled with choices\
  \ with new restaurants, cafes, and bars opening up each year, along with a wide\
  \ selection of boutique hotels.\nGentrification might have taken over this historical\
  \ city but the old riverside back-alleys of modern Porto, along many streets and\
  \ squares, have been reconstructed and historic buildings restored to its former\
  \ glory. After walking around the commercial center and seeing the Gothic cathedrals,\
  \ I was looking forward to visiting the two most talked-about and essential cultural\
  \ attractions: the world-class Fundacao Serralves museum of contemporary art, designed\
  \ by a native from Oporto Alvaro Siza Vieira and modern architecture Casa Musica\
  \ designed by Rem Koolhaas. \n\nTime for lunch! An affair taken seriously in Oporto!\
  \ To reach the other bank of Douro River I took an old tramway, then walked over\
  \ the 6-meters above water bridge (Ponte Maria Pia) crossing to Vila Nova de Gaia,\
  \ which is synonymous with Port wine trade, a riverfront area with dozens of company\
  \ lodges and warehouses (called \u2018caves\u2019), with some in business for over\
  \ three centuries. Long lines of cafes, bars, and restaurants along with cruise\
  \ boats docked along the esplanade are increasingly popular with tourists. First\
  \ I went to visit the oldest one, Taylor\u2019s Port which was established in 1692\
  \ and was dedicated to the production of fine Port wines for the past 325 years.\
  \ Regarded as the benchmark for Vintage Port, the originally family-owned firm pioneered\
  \ the \u2018LBV - late bottled vintage\u2019 port, as the world leading producer.\
  \ I took a private Taylor\u2019s tasting tour (starts at 12 \u20AC/adult), which\
  \ includes one LBV glass from 2012, a \u201CRuby Port from a single year, chosen\
  \ for its high quality and bottled after aging for four to six years in wood\u201D\
  . I could finally learn the differences between a Ruby and a Tawny. \n\nI had adopted\
  \ Porto (or the opposite?) and add it to my top five list of potential retirement\
  \ place to live under the blue skyline. From fourteenth-century Gothic churches,\
  \ traditional eateries, dusty antique markets to fabulous beaches along Foz do Douro,\
  \ dotted along by a plethora of restaurants, cafes and pubs, and two distinctive\
  \ riversides with their distinguished flavors, Oporto is a beacon of Portuguese\
  \ culture and spirit, all topped up with plenty of wine and of course, Porto!"
