Text: "It was your classic love story: Girl meets boy. Girl falls madly in love with\
  \ boy. Boy cheats on girl and gets another girl pregnant. The only solution to this\
  \ situation that my broken heart could muster was to put an ocean between us, so\
  \ I purchased a one-way ticket to Stockholm, Sweden. My na\xEFve view of Europe\u2019\
  s stereotypical boisterousness seemed to be exactly what I needed- the perfect numbing\
  \ agent for my feelings. \n\nThe moment that my plane touched down, I was hit with\
  \ a cold, hard reality that my experience in Sweden may not be what I had anticipated.\
  \ As I boarded the commuter train into the city, the first thing that I was noticed\
  \ as that the pristine car was filled to the brim with people, and yet the only\
  \ sound I could hear was a deafening silence. I soon came to learn that Swedes are\
  \ not ones for small talk; if I was going to make connections here, I was going\
  \ to need to get comfortable with baring my soul.\n\nI decided to start my trip\
  \ with the most quintessential Swedish thing I could possibly think of: the sauna.\
  \ As I walked through the recreation area on the outskirts of town, the smell of\
  \ pine trees, burning cedar, and freshly baked cinnamon buns filled my nostrils.\
  \ I walked up to the door of the sauna and stopped in my tracks; on the front door\
  \ of the sauna was a huge sign indicating that no bathing suits of any kind were\
  \ permitted inside the sauna. I could feel tiny palpitations in my heart as my prudish\
  \ North American sensibilities about nudity kicked in, yet something inside me told\
  \ me to persist. I disrobed completely and walked into the sauna and was met with\
  \ some light snickers from a few of the local women at the sight of my shorn lady\
  \ parts. It became evident to me as I looked around at the sea of brazen pubic hair\
  \ that the Brazilian wax had no place here. As this country literally stripped me\
  \ naked, I realized that I had no choice but to make myself more vulnerable here\
  \ and become unapologetically myself.\n\nA few weeks later, I was introduced to\
  \ allemansr\xE4tten, the Swedish concept and belief that land is \u201Cevery man\u2019\
  s right\u201D. In practice, this means that you are permitted to hike or camp anywhere\
  \ in the country with the exception of a person\u2019s private residence or garden.\
  \ After learning this, I endeavoured to camp somewhere completely outrageous, somewhere\
  \ that I would never be permitted to camp back home. After copious amounts of research,\
  \ I settled on a stunning cliffside site overlooking the Baltic sea campsite on\
  \ the island of Ut\xF6. The only catch was that this site was right in the middle\
  \ of Swedish military grounds. As I hiked to my campsite, I turned a corner and\
  \ could immediately feel my body tense up as I spotted a group of soldiers running\
  \ morning drills. I was confident that I was going to get in trouble for being on\
  \ this land. Instead, a soldier caught sight of me out of the corner of his eye;\
  \ he turned, smiled, and waved as I walked by. At that moment, I realized how many\
  \ limitations I had been putting on myself. Life in its entirety is every man\u2019\
  s right, it is MY right, and the only thing stopping me from fully living it is\
  \ me. \n\nAs my time abroad drew to a close, I bundled up and headed to the beach\
  \ to celebrate Valborg, a Swedish holiday signifying fertility and the beginning\
  \ of growing season. I joined a crowd of merry partygoers, standing around bonfires\
  \ twice as tall as me, toasting each other with tiny pocket flasks. I quietly watched\
  \ as the fire, in the true spirit of the holiday, burned the land, cleansing it\
  \ of everything dry and dead. At that moment, I knew that it was time; time to let\
  \ the spirit of Valborg release what was dead inside of me so that I could move\
  \ forward into my own season of growth. \n\nI went to Sweden to escape. What I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find there was myself."
