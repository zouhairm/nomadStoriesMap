Text: "A mild shudder was all it took to end my slumber. Half awake, I gazed out of\
  \ the window. The jetliner had barely touched the turf, it was a firm but smooth\
  \ landing. Emirates had lived up to its reputation, being a \"on time- every time\"\
  \ airline.  The flight captain radioed some metrological statistics in a jiffy.\
  \ The aeroplane glided on the runway for a while, taxied briefly  before it came\
  \ to a complete halt. I made my way through the aero bridge briefly after exchanging\
  \ pleasantries with the crew aboard. \n\nI swiftly mazed through the crowd, marched\
  \ out of the Changi Airport. The morning view of the city skyline was simply stupendous.\
  \ The golden sun had just perched out of the milky clouds. I could smell the scent\
  \ of fresh cool breeze . The tall trees swung in a cheerful manner, greeting me\
  \ on my arrival to the Lion City. \n\nWith bated breath, I looked forward to a rendezvous\
  \ with the lion city.\n\nWith half a day at my leisure, I set out to explore the\
  \ neighbourhoods. The tiny nation has a myriad of features of an ultramodern society\
  \ with its iconic buildings, high scale shopping malls, classy wide roads and and\
  \ efficient transport system. \n\nAfter having a sumptuous breakfast, I started\
  \ on my journey to feast my eyes. The first on my list was the botanical gardens,\
  \ a place worth visiting by all standards.The sprawling green gardens were very\
  \ well-preserved. A short visit to the flower garden and butterfly park made my\
  \ day. Next in line was the Singapore Zoo. The zoo is a home to several animals\
  \ and shrinking species and has a vast expanse which I covered by a circular tram\
  \ ride. The half an hour penguin show was a delight to watch. The highlights of\
  \ the zoo were it's conceptualisation, the exhibitions and shows and the dinosaur\
  \ park. Next to the zoo is the night safari, which is famed as a night animal park.\
  \ Unusual theme for a zoo park that opens up the night life of animals, from a close\
  \ distance. A power packed day ended with a visit to the flyer. A huge, grand London\
  \ eye styled observation wheel made me quiver for once. A ride on the flyer was\
  \ thrilling and ecstatic.\n\nDay two of my sojourn dawned with my visit to Sentosa\
  \ Park (a  recreation island). The cable car-ride to the island offered panoramic\
  \ views of the harbour. The man-made theme park had a multitude of offerings from\
  \ adventurous rides to an awesome aquarium and from a 4D movie show to a bombastic\
  \ fire show in the end. Amongst several other things, Universal Studios stood out.\
  \ An amusement park, it's a delight to watch. A day is just not enough to cover\
  \ all of the Sentosa.\n\nI had the opportunity of visiting the Jurong bird park\
  \ on the following day and this experience was second to none.  As I walked through\
  \ the multi coloured  aviary, waterfalls and souvenir shop was an unforgettable\
  \ experience. I boarded a cab and got down at the gardens by the bay, a nature's\
  \ gift in the midst of a concrete jungle spanning across a large open area. The\
  \ super trees, the skywalk and the flower dome were unmissable. Adjacent to the\
  \ garden is the iconic the Marina Bay Sands (a plush seven star luxury hotel) with\
  \ a distinctive rooftop swimming pool. Over looking the Marina Bay, it boasts ostensibly\
  \ of its high class offerings and panaromic views. An evening at the Clarke Quay\
  \ was so refreshing and exhilarating that I could barely content myself to return.\n\
  \n\"Good things come in small packages\" and this was quite apt for my sojourn that\
  \ came to an end.\n\nMerlion & I now have cartloads of memories that would stay\
  \ treasured in my heart. \n\nI didn't expect this excursion to be so happening."
