Text: "When we are young and growing up, there is always a person whom we admire.\
  \ Usually, it is a parent, teacher, or just a character, who is someone we look\
  \ up to and copy. For me, the moment when I started to be fascinated about an elder\
  \ person, besides my parents, was while I was watching cartoons. Surprising or not,\
  \ I could differentiate this character from others, sustaining that \u201EI want\
  \ to follow this way of thinking, this way of living\u201D. \nI could feel that\
  \ this role model influenced my actions and motivated me to strive to uncover my\
  \ true potentials and overcome my weakness. A few years later, being driven by a\
  \ profound curiosity, I jumped right in and set off to Sch\xF6nbrunn Palace, looking\
  \ to experience the imperial nostalgia of my childhood.\nI entered in this magical\
  \ place being shy at the beginning, but full of enthusiasm to discover the intimate\
  \ life of a feminine emblematic personality of Europe, the Empress of Austria, Elizabeth.\
  \ It was a long-awaited moment, even unimaginable because I was able to connect\
  \ my inner self with other generations over thousands of years.\nStepping forward,\
  \ I was wondering \u201EWhat would the walls utter if they could speak, or the rooms\
  \ tell me if they were talkative?\u201D. But even without responses, the story of\
  \ this place was bound to be knowledgeable. Therefore, I could see Sissi from another\
  \ perspective. It was a different image that I kept on my mind because this time\
  \ it wasn\u2019t about legends and myths, it was about the real life of one of the\
  \ most famous women in history described through her love, dreams and passions that\
  \ fascinated me, becoming more and more empathetic with this legendary beauty. \n\
  It was the ideal place to discover the truth, the cruel truth actually, that most\
  \ of her life was spent finding pure happiness, which was unreachable for her, having\
  \ many tragedies, starting with fighting for Hungary as a politician, and continuing\
  \ with being in an unfulfilling marriage with Franz Joseph. And then, I was wondering\
  \ again \u201EWhy was she famous only for her beauty?\u201D\nOnly arriving at this\
  \ idillyc place, you realize that nothing can reveal the real image of this character\
  \ more than the place where she lived. Here is the spot where the portrait of an\
  \ unforgettable woman who inspired me more than any other feminine character discovered\
  \ was painted with her stories, thoughts, beauty.. like a promise that the story\
  \ of her life will not remain only a ruined labyrinth."
