Text: "I walk into the familiar entrance holding my breath. Fifteen years. It\u2019\
  s been fifteen years since I\u2019ve walked through the doors of my great grandparents\u2019\
  \ home. The last time I was here I was sixteen. The walls had received a new coat\
  \ of white paint and I remember its strong odor mixing with the scent of the blooming\
  \ fruit trees, the ones that lined the courtyard like welcoming giants. \n\nDespite\
  \ my travels across Mexico in recent years, I\u2019ve avoided coming here, to El\
  \ Valle de Guadalupe, a tiny, crumbling town in the country\u2019s western state\
  \ of Michoacan. It was here where my parents were born, the place they left for\
  \ a better life in the United States, and where they\u2019d bring me each summer\
  \ as a child visiting great aunts I now only slightly remember. \n\nIt\u2019s been\
  \ years since there\u2019s been anyone to visit, and the ache of seeing my mother\u2019\
  s childhood home abandoned, has kept me at bay. But recently I\u2019ve felt a tug\
  \ to come back, a need to see where the story of my family began. And so I\u2019\
  ve returned, alone.\n\nI let go of my breath and look around me. The once pristine\
  \ walls are now gray, flaps of chipped paint hang off them like bursted veins. The\
  \ trees are no longer giants, but skeletons. On the ground below, their fruit rots\
  \ slowly. And in the house\u2019s four bedrooms, the beds are made as if still waiting\
  \ for someone to come home. \n\nMy mother warned me I\u2019d find nothing here,\
  \ and in a sense she\u2019s right. It\u2019s hard to know how many people truly\
  \ live here, most of the town\u2019s population now lives scattered across Chicago,\
  \ California and Texas. Those that remain are older men and women, the mothers and\
  \ fathers of adult children that visit throughout the year. The threat of kidnappings\
  \ and violence from drug cartels in the surrounding area keeps many away, and prevents\
  \ others from building that house or business they always dreamed about building.\
  \ \n\nI sit in a chair in the kitchen built by my great grandfather. The table has\
  \ a thick layer of dirt, so does the chair. I close my eyes and feel the knot in\
  \ my throat. What if, I think. What if my grandparents had returned to live here\
  \ instead of staying in Chicago? What if my mother\u2019s aunt hadn\u2019t died\
  \ so soon? What if we had taken care of this home? The tears stream down my face,\
  \ knowing the answers will never come. \n\nI get up and walk to the telephone room,\
  \ the place where as a girl, my mother worked as the town\u2019s operator, fielded\
  \ calls from loved ones calling from across the border. She\u2019d run up and down\
  \ the street delivering messages, hoping that one day one would be from her own\
  \ mother and father. \n\nI\u2019ve grown up listening to my mother\u2019s stories.\
  \ I\u2019ve seen her eyes sparkle each time she talks about this house, and have\
  \ heard her voice thick with melancholy as she describes how free she felt living\
  \ in this town she adored. All these years she\u2019s missed home, and I realize,\
  \ I have too. Though I\u2019ve never lived here, I feel a tie to this house, as\
  \ if somehow I carry it within me: the sacrifices of my ancestors, the unfulfilled\
  \ promises, the dreams never realized. \n\nI walk back to the courtyard. The sun\
  \ is setting and I feel the night chill setting in. I make my way to the entrance\
  \ and turn around for one last look. For a long time, I\u2019ve felt as if something\
  \ was missing, that there was a part of me I didn\u2019t fully understand. I never\
  \ realized I\u2019d find it here, in the one place I'd worked so hard to avoid."
