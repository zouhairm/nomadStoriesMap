Text: "An Indian at a Russian Banya could be symbolic of sexual repression and the\
  \ lack of it. \"Cute dick\", I said in my mind while swimming underwater at the\
  \ Banya, I got out of the pool and jogged towards the steam room. Bouncing boobies\
  \ was the most liberating feeling after wallowing in the pool I had just peed in.\n\
  \nThe steam room, with it's damp and humid interiors and an enormous wooden stove\
  \ had the old world charm of torture chambers, turning my face into a cookie while\
  \ my body enjoyed lashings with hot eucalyptus leaves. The temperature in there\
  \ made it impossible to breathe from the nose but next to me was a toddler being\
  \ nonchalant in his mother's lap. As I struggled to get my eyes off this adorable\
  \ baby, my leaf hitter enthusiastically exclaimed, \"Yash\xADe\xADRaj?\" Now I know\
  \ the Russians know their Bollywood - they really adore Bollywood, but I can barely\
  \ breathe in this hot room, let alone have a conversation about which actor is sleeping\
  \ with whom in India. Anyway, I affirmed, \"Da\xADda\xADda! Yashe Raj, Mithun Chakroborthy,\
  \ Hema Malana\", by now used to the Russian love for Bollywood. Turns out he was\
  \ asking if I wanted another lashing.\n\nHell have mercy if I ever turn down that\
  \ invitation. The heated up leaves, hitting your back, feet, bum is a profound language\
  \ of love hidden in the Banyas of Russia. With my body unburdened and mind full\
  \ of gratitude, I got up and instantly felt contempt upon spotting an Indian man,\
  \ staring at me, looking like the only Boromir in our fellowship of the steam room.\n\
  \nI felt so naked."
