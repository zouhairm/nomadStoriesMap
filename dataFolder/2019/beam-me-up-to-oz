Text: "My story starts with Missy Higgins, my favourite Aussie singer....As one of\
  \ her song goes \" If you know my destinaton, please buy the fastest car and throw\
  \ me the keys...\" This was a kind of message to leave my comfort zone because these\
  \ lyrics were written just for me! This music was able to beam me up to my Antipode!\n\
  \nOne month after my surgery, under the anesthesia effects perhaps, I decided to\
  \ have a honeymoon with myself so,a Spanish girl like me decided to begin her adventure\
  \ , going to the \" the other side\" I went to Oz where I can realize I am capable\
  \ of more than I know.\n\nAustralia is a dreamland when it comes to bucket list\
  \ experiences. It\u2019s an enormous country with numerous different landscapes,\
  \ activities, many things that I would say it\u2019s good enough for multiple trips\
  \ and and great memories for every taste. If you\u2019re such an adventurer, backpacker,\
  \ wild-life enthusiast, surfer, or explorer, then my Australian bucket list experience\
  \ is perfect for ya!\n\n\n One day tour of the Great ocean road was a definite highlight\
  \ of my trip to Australia. The trip is great value for money and the early start\
  \ ensures that you are able to see as many sites along the great ocean road as possible.\
  \ Rob, our guide was really fantastic, enthusiastic and entertaining in explaining\
  \ the historical and geographical elements of the great ocean road and made sure\
  \ every passenger was getting the most out of their day. During the trip we stopped\
  \ at beautiful surf beaches, coastal towns (including Lorne and Apollo Bay where\
  \ we spotted lots of wildlife including koalas), stopped for lunch at Cape Otway\
  \ Lighthouse, took in the rugged coastline, the Twelve Apostles (which are breathtaking),\
  \ Loch Ard Gorge and also had a scenic drive through the rainforest.  \n\n\nThe\
  \ Loch Ard Gorge is one of the best-loved stop-off points along the Great Ocean\
  \ Road. It\u2019s situated in the Port Campbell National Park and is just three\
  \ minutes from the world-famous formation of the Twelve Apostles.\n\nThe picturesque\
  \ gorge is home to a smooth, pearlescent bay and an inlet of clear, blue water.\
  \ It\u2019s flanked by two yellow-washed cliff faces and tufts of vibrant greenery.\
  \ Though it looks like something out of a storybook, Loch Ard isn\u2019t just a\
  \ pretty face. In fact, it has an interesting and colourful history that spans back\
  \ hundreds of years.\n\nIts name is no coincidence\u2026There is a legend that says\
  \ \" Back in 1878, a large clipper ship engraved with the name Loch Ard beached\
  \ on nearby Muttonbird Island after a tumultuous journey from England. Unfortunately,\
  \ only two of the fifty-four passengers survived, one of whom was a fifteen-year-old\
  \ boy called Tom Pearce, and the other a seventeen-year-old Irish girl called Eva.\n\
  \nBoth passengers were washed ashore during the event where Pearce proceeded to\
  \ raise an alarm to the surrounding locals. The act saved Carmichael\u2019s life,\
  \ though she returned to England soon after, having lost most of her family in the\
  \ tragedy. Pearce continued to live a fruitful life and was often referred to as\
  \ a hero of his time.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t always been this way\u2026\nBack in June\
  \ 2009, the arch of Island Archway crumbled in on itself, leaving two separate hunks\
  \ of rock that run parallel to each other. Many of the landmarks along Australia\u2019\
  s Great Ocean Road collapse thanks to weather conditions or water damage, which\
  \ serves to create and ever-changing landscape.\n\nThe two remaining rock pillars\
  \ of the gorge have been named Tom and Eva after the two survivors of the shipwreck\
  \ back in the 19th century\"\n\nWhile I was observing this unique landscape, suddenly\
  \ I understood....Sometimes, when you get lost, you find yourself"
