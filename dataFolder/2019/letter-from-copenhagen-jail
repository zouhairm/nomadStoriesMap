Text: "Today is the Fourth of July.\n\nIndependence Day in the United States of America.\n\
  \nIn Rebild, Denmark celebrates the friendship between itself and the USA.\n\nI\
  \ was writing this as the guard opened the solid metal door to my prison cell today\
  \ and told me to gather my belongings. I asked why. She brusquely said she was not\
  \ sure why or where but I was being taken somewhere else, then left. I put on my\
  \ shoes, as I had no personal belongings here. I had been stripped searched but\
  \ allowed to wear my clothes all week. Even the same underpants, unwashed because\
  \ washing clothes in your cell was forbidden. \n\nI never expected to find myself\
  \ in a Danish jail. I was glad the U.S. Embassy representative had visited me. I\
  \ gathered the pages I wrote while imprisoned in Venstre F\xE6ngsel, and put them\
  \ in my bra. I told myself to stay strong and remember details. The guard returned\
  \ and opened the door widely. I stepped out of the cell and followed her through\
  \ the dark grey prison corridors. We came to an outside door and I stepped out into\
  \ the bright sunshine. The daylight was shocking and I felt dizzy after days inside.\
  \ Then we quickly stepped back inside another part of the brick structure. \n\n\
  Once inside the building, we quickly came to an open dingy and familiar green and\
  \ grey area. There was a high desk with a uniformed officer behind it and two people,\
  \ a woman and a man, standing there on my side. The woman, dressed like she was\
  \ going to the beach in shorts, a t-shirt and flip-flops, was the female police\
  \ officer of the two who had arrested me in my home. The man, tall, looked like\
  \ the one who interrogated me. The Danish immigration caseworker refusing to process\
  \ my green card renewal, Anne Louise Jarulf, had lied to the Danish police and said\
  \ I was an illegal alien, so they knocked me to the floor of my bedroom and arrested\
  \ me. My head still ached from banging it on the metal radiator when they forcefully\
  \ grabbed me and rifled through my backpack. The officer at the desk slid my backpack\
  \ across the counter and gave it to the officers. They walked me to a black car,\
  \ put my backpack in the back seat and told me to get inside the car. I sat in the\
  \ back seat. It was hot, so hot and the sun was blindingly bright, my eyes wear\
  \ tearing up. I looked at the tall metal gate as we approached it,  my heart palpitating.\n\
  \nThe gate closed behind us, and I looked out the window at the brick prison wall\
  \ and tall iron gate. The car stopped. They both got out of the car and she came\
  \ around to the passenger side. She opened the door and ordered me to take my backpack.\n\
  \n\"It was a mistake. I guess you had an appeal. You had appealed in time\". she\
  \ said looking alternately at me and the ground. \"You should have told us\".\n\n\
  I should have told them? I did tell them. I had said numerous times that I was a\
  \ legal resident of Denmark and that my caseworker Anne Louise Jarulf knew when\
  \ she filed the papers for the wrongful arrest. Now I said nothing. It was so hot\
  \ and I was nauseous, shaking and disoriented.\n\n\"The train is over there\", she\
  \ continued.\n\nThey were driving to T\xE5rnby Police Station, several kilometers\
  \ away, near my home, where they had arrested me. However, they did not offer to\
  \ give me a ride from the western side of Copenhagen. I had no ticket money.\n\n\
  I looked down the entrance road, then, back at the brick and metal prison behind\
  \ me. The officers got in their air-conditioned car. I felt like Egon, the leader\
  \ of Danish film's famously incompetent gang of thieves, \_Olsen Banden (The Olsen\
  \ Gang), but there was no one waiting for me with a car and flags to take me home\
  \ to a celebratory meal and a drink.\n\n\"Today is the Fourth of July and I am free\"\
  , I said aloud, blinking away the tears filling my eyes. \n\nI started walking."
