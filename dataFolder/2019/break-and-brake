Text: "Dear reader,\n\nThey say you are not the same person once you return from a\
  \ place, I realized I have changed too.\n\nHaving a 4 month old baby and travelling\
  \ through mountains is not a very sane combination , so we decided to drop Nael\
  \ our 4 month old at his aunts , and we were all set to explore Nathia gali - a\
  \ hill station in Abbottabad district of KP Pakistan .\n\nWe started by road and\
  \ we felt a sudden change of air as we climbed Up. You know the kind of air that\
  \ refreshes your soul .The much needed escape from city lives. We stopped at the\
  \ gas station and man it was not the same too. There were beautiful people all along\
  \ the way, the kind of innocent beautiful you know, selling home made little bangles,\
  \ jewelry, I bought one flower crown. We played Mooroo along the way - you got to\
  \ hear his \"mai kon hoon\" to feel the love we felt in the journey. There were\
  \ wild monkeys that we took snaps with, there were huge pine & cedar trees on the\
  \ way, there were hiking tracks too. \n It was Lunch time by then \u2013 We decided\
  \ to have traditional sanghrila karhai (chicken gravy)- and had it at the top of\
  \ mountains in a hotel \u2013 and it tasted like yummy the aroma I can still feel\
  \ it. And Along with that we had chapli kebabs \u2013 made from mutton.\nWe decided\
  \ to stay in namli mera - a small village in Nathia gali - Our resort was an all\
  \ loner in the valley. Took the room with the best view both sides showing mountains,\
  \ it was July so no snow.\n\nAt 4:00 pm after keeping all the luggage in hotel room\
  \ .We hired a little Local boy as tour guide, he told us that village had a secret\
  \ water fall and he knows the way, we followed him and after a 15-20 mins of hike\
  \ we saw a couple of water falls \u2013 we saw a man narrating poetry on the way(He\
  \ seemed like he was missing his loved one a lot ), a small water drip tunnel within\
  \ the mountains having all the medicated herbs, it said water with healing!  We\
  \ drank it as if it will make us live more! We even filled a bottle.\n\nThe water\
  \ fall had little girls dancing in it \u2013 they were locals they said it\u2019\
  s their grandma\u2019s house. We literally got all wet with them .they were riding\
  \ little cars with hands in the water\nThen there was a small restaurant at the\
  \ water fall , you could keep your feet in the cold water and eat , we order French\
  \ fries and cold drinks \u2013 deadly combo  I must day . We sat there and took\
  \ pics and absorbed the air! The restaurant was made in steps we sat in the middle.\
  \ \n\nThen came the night \u2013 The sky full of stars like literally full \u2013\
  \ Unlike in cities \u2013 We sat outside the hotel room viewing the sky for an hour\
  \ almost \u2013 Then I got hungry since the route was dangerous to take in dark\
  \ so we opted to eat in our own hotel \u2013 This time we went for Chinese rice\
  \ they were OK, may be cause the got cold. Ate those then we sat in lobby just looking\
  \ at a family of 12 playing cards, we could tell they were having the times of their\
  \ life, time to sleep. Brought up in a conservative culture I can just say what\
  \ a night!\n\nNext day we had to start the returning journey \u2013 So for the last\
  \ catchup we hiked around 30 mins to secret spot , it was a plain on top of mountain\
  \ fully surrounded by pines and the cold air , I can still feel it on my face ,\
  \ it was LOVE! The kind where you can take panorama pics. We had breakfast at the\
  \ same water fall restaurant this time anda paratha (bread and omlate). It was hot\
  \ and tasty. We were full.\n\nThe way back was not as exciting off course , as i\
  \ got a bit of sickness but we knew we have a suit case full of memories and it\
  \ was all not same yes we changed for good!!\n\nLove,\nRehma"
