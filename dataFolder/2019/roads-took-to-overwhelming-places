Text: "It all started with a mindset. Mind was full of tiredness and with a curiosity\
  \ to move out of it. The only way I could look was to travel to never before reached\
  \ places. Then Actions happened. All the available sources I had were ,a few thousand\
  \ bucks and a two wheeler. I started my journey with my activa , which took me to\
  \  paths , I had never been. Straight away finding ways I reached a destination\
  \ named sambhalpur, it was a plateau area with developed roads and bridges, I travelled\
  \ around the city with no intention to turn back. Then my next destination with\
  \ all consciousness was Visakhapatnam, a place mostly known for beaches and sea\
  \ food. It felt like the beaches had a some kind of magic to make it feel like ones\
  \ relaxing in heaven. Then the next was the sea food, prawns , coconut , different\
  \ kinds of fishes. It all gave me the top of the world experiences.5 star hotels\
  \ in front of a great large ocean . The sight was so relaxing that till now I fell\
  \ like one should stay near a beach, do whatever you want, but near a beach.  \n\
  Then GOD had planned even more beauty of happiness for me. Then next place I visited\
  \ was Chennai, a. Metro city with a  south indian essence, south indian food, beaches\
  \ , Wide roads, tourists , rental cars and bikes,. I rented a bike , so as to experience\
  \ a feeling openly travelling with no bounds. A large never ending sky , ocean,\
  \ it all summed up to a great  soul fulfilling experience.Most of the time I spent\
  \ was near Marina beach spread across few kilometer. There I met different kinds\
  \ of people including locals , tourists. Mostly tourists from Nigeria, dressed in\
  \ western outfit,the local men wore lungi , where as women were in saaree.\nAfter\
  \ this experience of mindfulness life took me to Mumbai , the place of paparazzi.\
  \ The first thing I could do there was to experience the feel of indian cinema by\
  \ connecting with bollywood. there after I reached the place first was Mannat, the\
  \ place were Baazigar of bollywood lived, \"Shahrukh Khan\U0001F60D\". I had no\
  \ control on me , it was all the essence which took me there. Mumbai is the Maya\
  \ nagri of India, through it was crowded, but the experience was like it rooted\
  \ you from inside a feeling to do big in life.\nI leaved the place after experiencing\
  \ mumbai pune expressway , through I never reached pune.\nThen the Next was the\
  \ greatest of the great Holy destination Amritsar, there's a essence of heaven inside\
  \ the Darbar Sahib(The Golden Temple), I never wanted to come out of it, It summed\
  \ up as heaven with a view of shinning Gold all around the campus,T he langar seva(free\
  \ Food),  Apart from it I tasted the local cusines in a restaurant named  Makhkhan\
  \ Fish. At the end the recipe which connected with me was the soyabean champ(Locals\
  \ call it Veg meat), Spicy and heartwarming it tasted. Through this was not the\
  \ end , I reached various places in Amritsar , like jallianvala bagh,  Wagah Atari\
  \ Border and nearly all the local places.The large Gurudwara campus  , underground\
  \ areas, The streets near Gurudwara , and finally it ended with A softy \U0001F60B\
  .\nThis whole 15 day experience has a impact in my heart till now and by gods grace,\
  \ It may even stay for me lifetime.\U0001F490\U0001F490\U0001F490\U0001F490\U0001F490\
