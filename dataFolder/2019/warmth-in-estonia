Text: "The feeble cloud cover did little to offer respite from the northern sun, radiating\
  \ heat so harsh it seemed to exhaust even the thin layers of paint clinging to the\
  \ decrepit, wooden buildings. Windows across the city were flung open in the hopes\
  \ of coaxing in even the slightest of breezes \u2013 a futile attempt in a country\
  \ far more equipped to keep heat in, rather than out. \n\nThe few who found themselves\
  \ unfortunate enough to be inland during this time were nowhere to be seen.  Surely,\
  \ they had found a place on the riverbanks, sprawled in the shade of a birch tree\
  \ or dangling their feet in the cool water. \n\nWe, however, found ourselves seeking\
  \ refuge in one of the few ways we knew how: with beer. \n\nHalfway through a tour\
  \ of Tartu\u2019s Karlova neighbourhood, sweat adhering our clothing to our bodies\
  \ like cling film, we collapsed \u2013 inviting the perfectly cold Estonian craft\
  \ brew to expertly quench our thirst.\n\n\u201CWe almost ran out of hops a couple\
  \ of years ago,\u201D Maarja said, in response to my comment about the sheer amount\
  \ of Estonian craft beer there seemed to be. Brewpubs and taprooms decorated city\
  \ streets here and even the most divey of bars seemed to include a local microbrew\
  \ on their mostly traditional menus. The craft beer trend, so popular around the\
  \ world, had clearly not been ignored by Estonia. \n\nHowever, when most people\
  \ think of Estonia, if they bother to think of it at all, their minds will usually\
  \ only wander to the medieval old town in Tallinn. Unfortunately, there are many\
  \ who also would assume that this Baltic nation has matured little since its emancipation\
  \ from the Soviet Union in 1991. Images of imposing concrete buildings and soulless\
  \ monuments to the proletariat might be conjured by those who\u2019ve failed to\
  \ realise what Estonia has become. \n\nThe oppressive heat of that July day eased\
  \ as the hoppy pale ale hit my lips, taking the edge off as only a beer can in circumstances\
  \ such as these. \u201CWhy are there so many microbreweries?\u201D I asked Maarja.\n\
  \n\u201CBecause our two local beers are terrible,\u201D Maarja deadpanned as if\
  \ there were no room for dispute in this. \n\n\u201CSaku, yes,\u201D a stranger\
  \ sitting at the adjacent table piped up, referring to the Tallinn-based lager.\
  \ \u201CBut A. Le Coq has its place. If it\u2019s a day like this, if you\u2019\
  re at a music festival. Then it is good. But that\u2019s it. I think for most Estonians,\
  \ though, the two companies remind them of Soviet times. So they\u2019ve made their\
  \ own. And it\u2019s better. It\u2019s more Estonian, it doesn\u2019t feel Russian.\u201D\
  \ \n\nIt surprised me little that in a country that had distanced itself so much\
  \ from its Soviet past would extend this sentiment to its beer. Since 1991, Estonia\
  \ had gone to great strides to distinguish itself from its imposing Russian neighbour.\
  \ And in more than a quarter-century since, the nation had managed to become one\
  \ of the most technologically advanced in the world. But this was not without its\
  \ controversies, as Estonia\u2019s significant Russian population continued to feel\
  \ marginalised within the country they knew as home.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s not that\
  \ Estonians don\u2019t like Russians,\u201D said Kristjan, who had quickly moved\
  \ from his table to ours. \n\n\u201CI always thought they were so warm and welcoming,\
  \ I wanted to be Russian when I was younger. Estonians are so cold,\u201D Maarja\
  \ added. \n\n\u201CWe are,\u201D replied Kristjan. This sentiment I found ironic,\
  \ given the sheer effortlessness it took for him to move tables, to join a conversation\
  \ with complete strangers. \u201CIt\u2019s \u2018Mother Russia\u2019, we don\u2019\
  t like. Or fear, more like. But the fear is breaking here, it\u2019s different from\
  \ when I was younger. In Tartu, at least.\u201D\n\nMaarja laughed, \u201CThe rest\
  \ of the country may not agree, but we are Tartu hippies!\u201D\n\nOur conversation\
  \ lingered, until the sun sank in the sky and the heat of the afternoon began to\
  \ subside. \n\nThis is what had led me to Tartu \u2013 to discover the Estonia that\
  \ I knew existed. The Estonia beyond the cruise ship crowds of Tallinn or remnants\
  \ of Soviet occupation. An optimistic Estonia, full of warm people, looking to a\
  \ future that was all their own."
