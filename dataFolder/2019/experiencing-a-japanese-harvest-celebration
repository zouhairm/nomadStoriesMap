Text: "I met Justin while we were working as temporary filing assistants at a marine\
  \ insurance company. He identified as a musician and I thought that I could be considered\
  \ a writer and we were looking for adventure. We agreed upon a month of work exchange\
  \ on a farm a thirty minute train ride from Osaka, Japan and upon arriving, we were\
  \ given our instructions:\nPick the small dried flowers off the bottom of the budding\
  \ tomatoes. \nGently. \nDo not bruise the small green tomatoes. \nIn fact, try not\
  \ to touch them at all. \n\nWe would do this for hours in the greenhouse, music\
  \ on or talking across the rows of plants. It was tedious and sometimes boring and\
  \ I thought about how this was so different from what I thought farm work would\
  \ be.\n\nAfter a week, we were invited to the Harvest festival at the local temple.\
  \ It was pouring rain that day and we jogged the ten minute distance in our rain\
  \ boots. We arrived, scooted our boots under the narrow, soggy eves of the building\
  \ and found some space in the back corner of the room. It was all locals, mostly\
  \ old men, and one or two women and the air smelled of fried food and cigarette\
  \ smoke. The priest wore a black robe and a smashed, Smurf looking hat. It was clear\
  \ that this intimate ceremony had taken place for decades in this cramped temple\
  \ and that little had changed.\n\nWe tried talking with those around us and they\
  \ definitely tried talking with us, but between the local dialect, our extremely\
  \ loose grasp of Japanese, and the beer and sake flowing freely, it was difficult\
  \ to understand. We arrived at 3pm and it seemed they had been drinking since morning.\
  \ The feast was spectacular in the sense that it took up every square inch of table\
  \ space that wasn't occupied by ashtrays and alcohol. Jellies (savory and sweet),\
  \ seafood creatures I had never seen, mixed rice dishes, fried balls, fish balls,\
  \ chicken balls, sushi, sashimi, vegetable stews, and fancy cut fruit was piled\
  \ high on platters that overlapped one another so that I spent an inordinate amount\
  \ of time worrying that it would all collapse like Jenga if someone removed one\
  \ dish from the wrong angle.\n\nA man across from me began to play a small taiko\
  \ drum and the locals chimed in with a local song, but his rhythm was so off it\
  \ was killing me. I mimed an offer to play instead and for a moment I held the attention\
  \ of the entire drunken room in shock that the quiet Japanese American girl who\
  \ couldn\u2019t speak Japanese was more than proficient at playing some traditional\
  \ taiko beats.\nThey also sang tankobushi, a popular traditional coal miner\u2019\
  s song, which to their further delight, I also knew. It was surreal to feel like\
  \ a participant one moment and a foreigner the next.\n\nRight before we left, the\
  \ priest announced it was time for a ritual and produced a huge slab of fresh mochi.\
  \ It was no longer steaming because of the cold weather outside, but he murmured\
  \ a prayer then proceeded to throw it directly onto the tatami mat in front of him.\
  \ The men aggressively descended upon it and began to pull it apart, trying to get\
  \ the largest pieces. The one farmer who spoke passable English explained that the\
  \ person who came away with the largest piece would be granted good luck for the\
  \ rest of the year. We watched them tussle for a while then decided it was time\
  \ to head back to the farm. \n\nThe rain hadn\u2019t stopped and when I got back\
  \ to my room it was dark. I turned on the one weak lamp we had and wrote. The smell\
  \ of humid wood and shoji screens rattling in the wind unwrapped parts of myself\
  \ I realized I could only discover through experiencing days like this and I wanted\
  \ more."
