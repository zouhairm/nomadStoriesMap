Text: "I was day dreaming.  6 friends, crammed into a van travelling from coast to\
  \ coast across Australia. I looked at a map.  It seemed straight forward. On a whim\
  \ I took the plunge, booked a camper van and wrangled together 5 mates. \n\nThe\
  \ distance between the western most point and the eastern most point of Australia\
  \ is about 4,000km, as the crow flies. We allowed 14 days to complete our adventure,\
  \ and loosely based it on a trip The Leyland Brothers pioneered years earlier in\
  \ their TV series, \u201CWheels across a Wilderness\u201D. Sure, we would be travelling\
  \ in a luxurious McMansion on wheels, but we were still trekking from Steep Point\
  \ in Western Australia to Byron Bay in NSW\u2019s north east, seeing parts of Australia\
  \ usually reserved for the gnarliest Grey Nomads.\L\n\nWe set out in Perth, drowning\
  \ out the sounds of the city with off key renditions of Midnight Oil.  Our first\
  \ \u201Cstop\u201D, the true start of our road trip, was to be Steep Point.  After\
  \ 8 hours of excited driving North, we veered off into the Steep Point turnoff.\
  \ 140km of corrugated road stretched between us and destination Steep Point.  Contemplating\
  \ the low clearance of our 2wd camper, a change of plan followed.  Shark Bay, the\
  \ second western most point sound just fine.  \n\nFrom Shark Bay we travelled all\
  \ day southeast to Sandstone, a small community with a population of about 50, 25\
  \ of whom we met that night at the pub. I gauge the authenticity of an outback pub\
  \ by the number of staff sourced from English backpackers, earnestly fulfilling\
  \ their visa requirements. This pub scored high. The locals were stoked to have\
  \ 6 thirsty 20 somethings in their bar that the usual closing time of 9pm went out\
  \ the window and the night escalated into bar scenes reminiscent of Priscilla, Queen\
  \ of the Desert. \n\nNext we drove south towards the Nullabor, via Kalgoorlie, discovering\
  \ just how popular the Skimpies are in these outback parts. What\u2019s a Skimpy,\
  \ I hear you say?  Out there, a Skimpy is a barmaid, serving drinks in her lingerie,\
  \ with a smile. As I walked past one pub an older lady came outside. I nodded hello\
  \ and asked her thoughts about the service inside. \u2018To be honest I think I\u2019\
  d feel a little ripped off if I was served by someone wearing clothes,\u2019 she\
  \ laughed.  \n\nWe had a BIG next few days. We were going up against the famously\
  \ flat Nullabor. 1675km of bitumen. I made a captain\u2019s call and grabbed the\
  \ wheel so I could steer us across \u201CAustralia\u2019s straightest road\u201D\
  .  Not that there was much steering involved.  We stopped for lunch and were told\
  \ about the Nullabor Nymph from a truckie.  She was a nude chick; lived with the\
  \ \u2018roos in the 70\u2019s. We hadn\u2019t even seen one kangaroo yet, so we\
  \ didn\u2019t fancy our chances of spotting the elusive, if now somewhat aged, naked\
  \ Nymph. But still, we looked hard. \n\nConscious of the fact that if we were to\
  \ make it to Byron within schedule, we needed to put some serious KM\u2019s behind\
  \ us.  We headed North towards Andamooka, an opal mining town about 6 hours north\
  \ of Adelaide. Dirt roads and dust everywhere, a lunar landscape, with a small town\
  \ charm.  We met up with Peter, a local for more than 50 years, and he guided us\
  \ on a tour of the mines. Peter is not only an opal miner but also the town\u2019\
  s weatherman, Sashimi Chef, Motelier and Postman. As we headed off we discovered\
  \ he was also the towns philosopher: \u2018Remember Folks, if it looks good it is\
  \ good\u2026 if it looks crap, it\u2019s probably crap.\u2019\n\nThe next 72 hours\
  \ are a blur of roadhouses, toilet stops and kitschy souvenirs. We had to continue\
  \ north through the Northern Territory before heading east through Queensland.\n\
  \nWe arrived in Byron Bay on our second last day. Feeling elated that we had made\
  \ it, Shaun, the engineer in the group stretched out the map and started calculating\
  \ the kilometres covered. 10,108km in 12 days. Fast, but fun. \n\nLater that night\
  \ we shared a few beers, pulled out the map and queried, \u2018where else did the\
  \ Leyland Brothers go?\u2019"
