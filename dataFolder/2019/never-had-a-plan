Text: "Well first I would like to introduce myself, my name is Damian, I\u2019m 23\
  \ years old and I\u2019m from Mexico. \n\nI guess that this story is like the kind\
  \ of stories that you\u2019ve never plan but happens. \nEverything begun when I\
  \ decided go to Romania the last October. I was trying to find myself and prove\
  \ how good I am with the facts of go outside and see how good I am doing things\
  \ out of my comfort zone  if I\u2019m honest I didn\u2019t know what I\u2019ll see\
  \ or what I should expect cuz for me at that time Romania doesn\u2019t exist, sounds\
  \ weird and super dummy but I never searched or saw something about that country.\
  \ \nBesides of my bit knowledge and my ignorance, that trip was my first one in\
  \ Europe, so I was there breathing deep and looking for adventure far away from\
  \ home. I remember my parents at the airport looking me and thinking about my safe\
  \ and how sad they felt cause in somehow they thought that I\u2019ll never return\
  \ to home. \n\nAs soon as I arrived at Frankfurt I knew that I have to paid attention\
  \ to everything and wait by the way for my next flight, took me like 6 hours and\
  \ meeting my first jet-lag to discovered by myself that for the first time I wasn\u2019\
  t in home and I will not be the same Mexican guy. \n\n11:10 pm timeline Romania,\
  \ barely putted a feet on the airport and i didn\u2019t have idea about what I should\
  \ done, cuz my final destination was Cluj-Napoca. A beautiful City in the middle\
  \ or maybe more in the north of the country.  It was foolish from me to arrived\
  \ there and haven\u2019t planned how to get there, so I left the airport and I thought\
  \ three ways of arrive there, bus, train or a airplane. I thought that train will\
  \ be the best way cause you know, Europe and the famous trains trips are something\
  \ that all the Mexican people hears about it. I took the most hard decision for\
  \ my back and the best for part my pictures on Instagram \U0001F602 \nTook me like\
  \ 10 hours by train to arrived Cluj. By the time when I arrived I only was thinking\
  \ in one thing, a bed and 12 hours with it. \nI spent 3 months there and being in\
  \ another country with a lot of foreign people is one of the thing that without\
  \ doubt I\u2019ll do it again, I met a lot of people whom even now I remembered\
  \ them and I just think In how much i miss them and how lucky i feel for be part\
  \ of their lives. \nDo not tell them but i met three guys, such an amazing guys\
  \ a Brazilian and funny man and my dear friend, Manu from Argentina, we lived together\
  \ so obviously we share a lot of moments. \nOne of my favorites was at the end of\
  \ November, we decided to go and see for ourselves the Dracula\u2019s Castle and\
  \ the most luxuries castle ever in Romania, Peles Castle. I remembered that I told\
  \ them to not think in how we\u2019ll get there and just enjoy the trip. Jaja it\
  \ was a mistake, in the morning of that Saturday we looked for a bus and train and\
  \ everybody told us that we had only one train-way to go there and one bus-way yo\
  \ arrived there \U0001F602\nWe should made a reservation one night before, we were\
  \ a little disappointed and decided that maybe the next weekend will be a better\
  \ option, walking down street the bus driver made sound the horn and told us that\
  \ 3 persons hadn\u2019t arrive so we can took their places it was embarrassed for\
  \ me but not for them cuz they told me that with that peculiar way to start an adventure\
  \ I should know for sure that it will be. They were right! \n\nThe best weekend\
  \ ever, I met Dracula\u2019s vibes, luxury\u2019s things, heart hometowns bears,\
  \ skins, snow and a lot of -10 degrees \U0001F602\n\nI will tell you a lot of details\
  \ on that but im  certain of those ones are which we keep in our memories happily\
  \ and safely."
