Text: "Being a well-seasoned traveler I never would have thought my most terrifying\
  \ experience would happen while traveling New Zealand. My sister and I spent six\
  \ weeks together traveling Australia and New Zealand. Our last week was spent in\
  \ a camper van touring the South Island of New Zealand. We had slept under the stars\
  \ in the outback of Australia, stuck our toes in Whitehaven beach, gone snorkelling\
  \ in the Great Barrier Reef, and bungee jumped in Queenstown, we thought our last\
  \ couple of days in Christchurch would be quiet and uneventful. We had found a campground\
  \ minutes from the ocean and we were looking forward to winding down.  \n\nWe had\
  \ spent the day touring Christchurch, discovering the devastating effects of the\
  \ many earthquakes the city has endured over the years. Locals informed us that\
  \ it was difficult to rebuild a city that continued to experience significant quakes.\
  \ Some areas still had not been rebuilt, five years after the 2011 earthquake that\
  \ caused massive damage. \n\nAfter an early dinner reminiscing about our travels,\
  \ we called it a night since we had an early departure in the morning. I was warm\
  \ and cozy in the comfort of our camper van, when I first felt the tremor at midnight.\
  \ Half asleep my initial thought was that someone was outside physically shaking\
  \ the van. I sat up and immediately realized something wasn\u2019t right. I shook\
  \ my sister awake.\n\n\u201CWhat is that?\u201D I asked. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s probably\
  \ just an earthquake,\u201D said my oblivious sister.\n\nAnd with that she rolled\
  \ over and fell back asleep, leaving me wide-awake and rattled. Thinking to myself\
  \ that I was probably just over reacting, that Christchurch experiences mini earthquakes\
  \ on the regular, I went back to sleep.  I would later discover that the earthquake\
  \ was a magnitude of 7.8 and ruptures had occurred on multiple faults. It has been\
  \ described as the \u201Cmost complex earthquake ever studied.\u201D\n\nAbout an\
  \ hour after the earthquake the sirens started\u2014a sound I will never forget.\
  \ \n\nMy sister shot out of bed so quickly that I couldn\u2019t help but exclaim,\
  \ \u201COh, now you\u2019re awake.\u201D \n\nWithin minutes the woman from our campground\
  \ was knocking frantically on our window yelling, \u201CYOU HAVE TO EVACUATE RIGHT\
  \ NOW. THERE IS A TSUNAMI WARNING. DO YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO?\u201D\n\nLooking back\
  \ I would love to have seen the expressions on our faces because I\u2019m sure our\
  \ jaws were on the floor. It was last thing I would have predicted to leave her\
  \ lips. She hurriedly gave us directions to evacuate and left to warn the rest of\
  \ the campers. We rushed to fold the bed away and began chucking the bags from the\
  \ front seat into the back of the van. Barefoot and still in our pyjamas we jumped\
  \ into our van, me in the drivers seat, my sister in the passengers seat, to head\
  \ to higher ground. \n\nLeaving the campground was like nothing I have ever witnessed\
  \ before. It was like a scene from an apocalyptic movie. Cars were coming from every\
  \ direction, both lanes were being used to go in the same direction, and no one\
  \ was letting anyone in. In the chaos of leaving the campground, we were still unsure\
  \ of where we were supposed to be heading. We decided to simply follow the rest\
  \ of the cars that we assumed were going to higher ground.\n\nLooking back we were\
  \ extremely lucky. No tsunami actually hit Christchurch, but it still remains to\
  \ be one of the most terrifying experiences of my life. We ended up driving six\
  \ hours south to Queenstown, witnessing a beautiful sunrise and taking in the gorgeous\
  \ views of Lake Tekapo along the way. We arrived in Queenstown, exhausted and delirious\
  \ from the day\u2019s events, only to have to say goodbye shortly after arriving.\
  \ I had a flight to catch that evening taking me back to Melbourne, where I was\
  \ living at the time. After all the fear and chaos, we were reluctantly saying goodbye\
  \ knowing we wouldn\u2019t be reunited in Canada for another 6 months. Needless\
  \ to say when planning a trip, expect the unexpected, you can\u2019t always plan\
  \ for everything."
