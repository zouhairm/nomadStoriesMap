Text: "For almost 15 years I\u2019ve been saying over and over that I don\u2019t want\
  \ kids. No one and nothing had been able to change my mind. But last Christmas when\
  \ I almost rolled over a six-year-old while skiing in M\xF6lltaler Gletscherbahnen,\
  \ at 3123 meters above sea level glacier in Austria, that conviction shuddered and\
  \ lasted far more than a second. \nHow do I, a Mexican girl got there? The story\
  \ can get as complicated as you want, but long story short I was doing a short stay\
  \ in Italy to complement my Master\u2019s research. I was staying in Padova, a northern\
  \ city twenty minutes away by train from Venice. One day while having a nice girl\u2019\
  s night out in the city center, we run into with this Austrian guy that knew my\
  \ friend from before. We started talking and we got along as soon as he started\
  \ asking me about the ancient cultures of my country and skipping the traditional\
  \ questions about narcos or the wall. \nBy then, my Christmas holidays seemed to\
  \ be lonely since all my European friends were going back home and they had already\
  \ tickets booked.  That\u2019s when he invited me to spend some days with his family\
  \ at his home town: Spittal an der Drau a little village in South Austria. As someone\
  \ coming from a tropical country I had never saw snow before, so the promise of\
  \ slide ridding, skating in a frozen lake and skiing were absolutely tempting. With\
  \ all that in mind I took a leap of faith and accepted. \nIt was my first time in\
  \ that part of Europe so everything was new for me: the breathtaking views of mountains\
  \ covered in snow, the language that I couldn\u2019t understand and the little villages\
  \ calm and clean. \nAfter a few days hosted by his family, he took me to ski to\
  \ M\xF6lltaler Gletscherbahnen which is a glacier within a National Park very popular\
  \ among Austrians. Many Slovenian and Croatian athletes train there and there used\
  \ to be a gold mine next to it until America was found and the price of this metal\
  \ collapsed. Many would argue that this kind of glacier at lower altitudes it\u2019\
  s only impressing if you live in the Western Alps. But the views that you get, even\
  \ in the beginning of the tracks are spectacular.\nBecause it\u2019s not that high,\
  \ you don\u2019t feel mountain sickness so it\u2019s very comfortable and fun. There\
  \ are several tracks for ski where you can practice from \u201Cbasic\u201D to really\
  \ steep slopes.  Of course, if you have never been in the snow before, nothing is\
  \ basic enough. I felt several times, rolled over and ended in his arms until finally\
  \ it seemed that I was getting it. \nAnd then, when I finally got to do this more\
  \ advanced slope, it happened. This little kid in his green jacket passed me full\
  \ speed very, very close. His confidence, skills and the cuteness were so distracting\
  \ that I almost felt. And for the first time in so many years I thought: \u201C\
  when I have my kids, I\u2019m definitely taking them to ski\u201D. \nHow did this\
  \ happen? How someone that is so confident in not having kids because of her lifestyle,\
  \ suddenly had this thoughts?\nI think it has to do with the fact that Austrian\
  \ dads seem to be more present in the life of their children. In Mexico normally\
  \ the father is absent working and your mother is the one who raises you. Even with\
  \ economical support, normally is a single handed task. For a plant crazy biologist\
  \ traveler like me, that has been a strong reason for not wanting kids. But there,\
  \ surrounded by the mountains, hosted by amazing people and finally seeing a place\
  \ and a culture where I might want to raise kids, I doubted every single thing that\
  \ I had planned for my life. \nWould I have kids? Honestly I don\u2019t know. Maybe\
  \ one day, in some trip I\u2019m finally going to find the place in this world where\
  \ I would like to settle. But until then\u2026 I\u2019ll keep traveling as much\
  \ as I can."
