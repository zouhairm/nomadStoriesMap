Text: "As I step into the ferry, I again realized that it was a great decision to\
  \ rather choose Flixbus to go to Denmark, than an airplane, because the marvellous\
  \ view of the Baltic Sea waves for almost two hours was the perfect tuning for visiting\
  \ the Scandinavian area. Sitting in a window seat makes me feel to be in a Victorian\
  \ novel and this sense of being in the middle of a historical scene hunted me for\
  \ also the next few days I spent in the city of Elsinore. \nThis feeling continued\
  \ when I leave the train station of the city later and accidentally almost slam\
  \ into the statue of Hamlet (and Ophelia), the ones who make the city well-known\
  \ world widely. My accommodation was a little bit off from the city centre and the\
  \ seaside, but at walking there I have a chance to explore the warm and folksy style\
  \ of the city with its narrow sidewalks and cosy houses, which impression is improved\
  \ by my host\u2019s kindness. As I listened her, totally forgot about my four bags,\
  \ because it seemed that I meet an official Elsinore guide and I gave enough program\
  \ possibilities for at least four days. At first it was odd that she stands in front\
  \ of me with wet hair, while I was so grateful to my past myself, who packed the\
  \ thicker gloves of mine. Lastly, she was give me explanation to it by herself telling\
  \ me that she is just arrived from a \u201Cwinter bath\u201D. That means she is\
  \ a group member, who regularly spend some time in a sauna house and then, to cold\
  \ themselves, also take a dip in the Baltic Sea which is approximately 3 degree\
  \ at these months. My eyes started to shine for this adventure (while my body start\
  \ to shake even to the thought), so when she has invited me to join on the next\
  \ night, I only can say \u201Chappily\u201D with a big smile. \nThe next day I saw\
  \ the sun only for a few minutes all day and the freezing north wind is blow when\
  \ I explore Hamlet\u2019s castle, Kronborg which was surrounded by hand sculpture\
  \ pieces in the water, symbolizing people fleeing from the water. I try not to give\
  \ too much importance and fortune-teller role to them, but at the Maritime Museum\
  \ next to the castle I find out that maybe I am \u201Cculturally\u201D not connected\
  \ enough for such an adventure as \u201Cwinter bath\u201D, because I am coming from\
  \ a country which only wants to have a seaside, but which hasn\u2019t\u2026\nIt\
  \ didn't help much to my self-confidence that the locals, put ice cubes in all kinds\
  \ of drinks, just naturally: in the water besides my wine and in the lemonade \u2013\
  \ three fat ice cubes in each. And what put the icing on the cake was the Rib House\
  \ which offer unlimited ice cream eating possibility to their delicious, but crazily\
  \ big rib menus. \nBut nothing could have held me back, at 8 o\u2019clock I eagerly\
  \ waited for my host to bring me to their sauna house. Her kindness and patience\
  \ at last bring back my courage (despite of the fact that at the accommodation I\
  \ thought about writing a farewell letter in case of if something went wrong\u2026\
  ). We spend about 10 minutes in the sauna which was 90 degrees Celsius and then\
  \ go out in a towel to the fresh air and the water. I haven\u2019t got problems\
  \ with the fresh air and I take some steps into the water (after my host confidently\
  \ dipped in the water) and I stopped after I feel my legs totally freezing... It\
  \ seemed I was a coward, but my host said it is a good first step, so I will tell\
  \ all my friends that I would like to go back to Elsinore, so I have to leave a\
  \ little winter bath adventure also for the next time\u2026"
