Text: "After a couple of hours walking and searching,  trudging by the river, drinking\
  \ beers and eating \"Francesinhas\" I could finally find it, It was infront of me!\n\
  \ My hearth was beating like never before:  Fernando pessoa\xB4s house! the mitic\
  \ portuguese writer. \n \nI was discovering myself again, sculpting my time in the\
  \ midle of this magical city, remembering the words of my grandfhater:  Remember\
  \ son, you are of the size of what you see, not the size of your height. A pessoa\xB4\
  s legendary phrase. \n\nWhat I end up finding there, change my life forever. Since\
  \ I took the first step into the house an atmosphere of jasmine surrounded me completely\
  \ transporting me in to a time where nothing was more important than living with\
  \ others,  where sharing a good wine, listening to fado music and sitting by the\
  \ river to declaim poetry was the common way of telling to the others: I'm here\
  \ with you, we are what we see together.\n\n I was there following my grandpa steps.\
  \  I still remember the pictures that he showed to me and my brothers when we were\
  \ children: a cold steel bridge crossing a big blue river, the purple and gold sunsets,\
  \ the alleys of blue tiles, I could almost smell the sardines and olives I saw in\
  \ his photographs. My heart was shaken for a moment.\n\nA breeze of fresh air shook\
  \ my thoughts, I entered that house without thinking twice. At the end of a green\
  \ corridor there was a big fountain, the sound of water droplets flowing into the\
  \ room. I decided to sit down to admire every detail of that place, patiently waiting\
  \ for something to happen. \n\nThe sound of the water was slowly forced by the laughter\
  \ of women who were approaching where I was, it was inevitable for me to associate\
  \ the smell of the jasmines with their presence. I stared at the ground distressed\
  \ to have entered that house without permission from anyone. When I looked up I\
  \ could see her for the first time, smiling, wearing a long white dress, her golden\
  \ hair shining with the rays of the sun, it was like a walking Greek sculpture,\
  \ so beautiful that I could hardly believe it. My first impulse was to approach\
  \ to apologize for being there without permission. Her eyes fixed on me.\n\n- Saudade,\
  \ she told me after watching my face. I\xB4ll never forget that word. Some people\
  \ define it as the love that remains or the nostalgia for someone or for something\
  \ very dear and that is no longer. I was dumbfounded, how could she know ? was I\
  \ so transparent? a brief silence prevailed in the room. \n\n- What\xB4s your name?\
  \ I ask confusing by the situation.\n\n- My name is Andiara, she told me, and this\
  \ is my family house, they are my sisters. Mirari, Elizama and Tareyja. \n\n- Your\
  \ family house? Was it possible that they were relatives of Pessoa?  what was happening\
  \ was something incredible, a turn of life that put me face to face with the family\
  \ of my favorite writer, the reason for my trip was revealed in front of me. I start\
  \ to ask her questions about her family, abouth their roots, about her relationship\
  \ with pessoa, Who was that woman who was in front of me?. she just looked at me\
  \ calmly and serenely.\n\n- Come whit me I\xB4m going to show you something. she\
  \ took my hand and together, we crossed the corridor, walked through the room illuminated\
  \ by the summer sun, climbed a long metal staircase in the shape of a snail where\
  \ at the end was a large wooden door. the smell that was perceived in that room\
  \ was a mix of old wood combined with orange perfum. at the end of the room there\
  \ was a chest, Andiara opened it. \n\nAt last I could understand it, seeing it there\
  \ at the end of a pile of old papers. There was the photograph of my grandfather,\
  \ hugged with pessoa, in the middle of a tiled alley. On the back I could read the\
  \ following sentence:\n\nAll the sentences in the book of life, if read to the end,\
  \ will end in an interrogation."
