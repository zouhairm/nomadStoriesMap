Text: "It\u2019s a DEPARTURE day, time to say Sayounara japan with heavy heart and\
  \ loads of memories.\n\nJapan,\nThe country that inspired me to romance,\nDidn\u2019\
  t miss any chance,\nTo roam in a country which has no nuisance,\nAte slept and danced,\n\
  And let my happiness enhanced,\nEnjoyed flamboyance,\nOf a country which is very\
  \ advance,\nFelt blissful in every glance,\nWhile watching art of renaissance,\n\
  \nReached airport well before departure time, all thanks to the people of japan\
  \ who are always punctual. Well advanced technology made smooth hassle free check\
  \ in, immigration & security.\n\nAfter a good quality shopping time at duty free,\
  \ came the twist. At boarding gate the officer asked, \u2019passport, please?\u2019\
  . Hands inside out of every pocket in jeans and compartment of hand bag, but couldn\u2019\
  t find my passport. Eye balls were dancing on rhythm of heart beat. Questions were\
  \ arising as fast as people passing by me. Trying to recollect, where I kept my\
  \ passport.\n\nSoon after realising that I had lost my passport while shopping,\
  \ I was seen with head down, tears rolling over cheeks, sitting in major discomfort\
  \ in front of Mr kenta, immigration officer.\n\nAfter hours of interrogation finally\
  \ Mr Kenta in low pitch tone, whispers, \u2018Gentleman let\u2019s have dinner\u2019\
  . A sigh of relief ran through my body after major distress. \n\nAn extremely rude\
  \ officer turns to a very good friend on dinning table. Made a point that I\u2019\
  m comfortable and relaxed. Shared his tiffin box with me, taught me few words, showed\
  \ me movies. Didn\u2019t leave me till I boarded my next flight. Called up my mom\
  \ and said, your child is absolutely safe and coming back soon.\n\nWhile leaving\
  \ he gave me a chit and said, open this when flight is about to take off.\nIt stated,\
  \ \u2019Please take care of your passport next time\u2019.\n\nI too left a letter\
  \ on his desk \n\nMr kenta carries a heart,\nThat will never make you feel apart.\n\
  Carries a touch,\nThat never hurts.\nCarries a pair of eyes,\nThat never lies.\n\
  Carries attitude,\nThat will never make you feel rude.\nCarries a soul,\nThat never\
  \ makes you feel less then gold.\nCarries trust,\nThat never rust.\nCarries calmness,\n\
  That never mess.\nCarries a pair of ears,\nThat never lets you in fears.\nCarries\
  \ a strong spine,\nThat never fades your shine.\nCarries a scar,\nThat never makes\
  \ you feel far.\nCarries cheeks,\nThat never makes you feel weak,\nCarries an eyelid,\n\
  That never greed.\nCarries name,\nThat never asks fame.\nCarries a mind,\nThat u\
  \ will never find."
