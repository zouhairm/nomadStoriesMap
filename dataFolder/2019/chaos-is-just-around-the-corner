Text: "I curled my feet around the edges of the empty duvet cover, noting that despite\
  \ the small beads of sweat beginning to gather on the curve of my upper lip, I still\
  \ longed to feel cosy as I merged into chapter twenty-seven of my deepening thriller.\
  \ \n\n\u201CVi\u1EC7t Nam v\xF4 \u0111\u1ECBch! Vi\u1EC7t Nam v\xF4 \u0111\u1ECB\
  ch! Vi\u1EC7t Nam v\xF4 \u0111\u1ECBch!\u201D Once again, screeching and chanting\
  \ broke my cocoon of peace, yet this was the first time I was able to make out the\
  \ words the gathering crowd below expelled as they huddled over the glowing box.\
  \ In a tiny hem where, if my neighbour opposite were to stretch her arm out from\
  \ her balcony we could join hands, children\u2019s laughter, the speakerphones of\
  \ local motorbike vendors and the hum of chatter had become ordinary background\
  \ noise to my evenings. I pondered going to investigate if this was just regular\
  \ Tuesday happenings whilst also scanning the page for the point that my eyes left\
  \ it no more than a few seconds ago. \n\nIn a stubborn refusal to read the same\
  \ 100 words yet again in an effort to concentrate, I pulled on my jeans, swept up\
  \ my purse off the desk and clicked the door behind me. \n\nThe humidity hit me\
  \ like a wall as I stepped onto the street taking in the metal-scented, heavy air\
  \ of the city. Scanning the narrow street up and down, I found that the pockets\
  \ of locals gathered at various points along the street peering into open homes\
  \ had somewhat dissipated. \n\nA high-pitched car horn - or what I thought it may\
  \ have been - turned my head to the end of the alleyway which led onto the main\
  \ street. A flash of red whizzed by, followed by another and another. Eventually,\
  \ a steady stream of red in all shapes and sizes was flying past the opening. More\
  \ horns followed, in fact, more everything followed: more flashes of red, more people,\
  \ more chanting. \n\nMy curiosity and anxiety increased simultaneously as I neared\
  \ the opening to the street. As I turned my head to my right, it was all of a sudden\
  \ louder than I had realised from the safety of my secluded hem. The noises were\
  \ ringing in my ears, the dank pollution smell felt thicker in my lungs and my eyes\
  \ were overwhelmed by a sea of red. \n\nLike they were more curious than my brain,\
  \ my feet carried my body over the well-trodden pavement where I often fought for\
  \ space against the onslaught of motorbikes up to the top of the street. I slowed\
  \ and stared around, returning the expressions of pure joy others expressed towards\
  \ me as they raced ahead, not sure if I was being entirely true to the way the rising\
  \ corners of my mouth were pressing my eyes closed. \n\nBefore me, victorious chaos\
  \ unfolded: children with cheeks embellished with tiny flags stood on the shoulders\
  \ of parent\u2019s waving six-foot flags, excited teenagers scrambled up the statues\
  \ that usually sat centre stage of a functioning roundabout, devil-red flares razed\
  \ in every corner of my vision. I stumbled back and slotted into the thrall of people\
  \ that, like me, had emerged bewildered from their homes. United, we watched as\
  \ nothing but an ocean of people on motorbikes and hanging from the top of roofless\
  \ trucks swarmed and manoeuvred around each other like bees on a honeycomb. \n\n\
  It was up until this evening, that I had never experienced such an act of patriotism.\
  \ Especially not over a semi-final victory in an Asian football league; I learned\
  \ later that evening that Vietnam had just got through to the semi-finals of the\
  \ Under 23\u2019s Asian Championship and boy, did they know how to celebrate!"
