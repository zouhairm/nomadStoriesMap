Text: "When I imagined Egypt I did not think of shooting stars. I imagined it different,\
  \ very diferent. \nAfter five days in Ras El Bar, I travelled for ten hours to a\
  \ place I had never heard of, a place I had never seen on television, in history\
  \ books or in famous magazines. Maybe part of my ignorance, I really do not know.\
  \ \nFirst, I travelled for three hours, which felt four or maybe six, to Cairo.\
  \ The truck in which I was traveling felt like an earthquake on the Egyptian routes\
  \ and the constant movement did not allow me to sleep, perhaps this was due to the\
  \ urgency to reach the shooting stars or the campfire in the desert. \nThen, seven\
  \ hours separated me from the final destination. The roads in Egypt are strange,\
  \ lonely. Lunch in a place lost on the sand surprised me: here the customs are different,\
  \ first leave the sneakers outside and then get in. Carpets and cushions cover the\
  \ cold sand of the Egyptian desert. The food is different, with plenty of  spices\
  \ and arab bread comes in huge bags. \nThe road seemed endless ahead of us. In the\
  \ distance, huge sand dunes and a dream sunset. If you wonder if I had ever thought\
  \ I would feel on top of the world contemplating the sunset, surely my answer would\
  \ be no, not at least in Egypt. But that was not my final destination. Half an hour\
  \ later  the White desert was in front of me. \nThe beauty of this desert is indescriptible,\
  \ it is far from any logic or fable about deserts in Africa. In this  science fiction\
  \ landscape, the snow takes over the desert through lime stones and in time, the\
  \ erosion has  filled asperities in the rock creating natural sculptures like pieces\
  \ of a lost museum. \nNight came and they began to build a large tent that would\
  \ become an improvised dining room in the White desert. The fire helped to escape\
  \ a Little from the cold and the stars took center stage at night. I had never seen\
  \ a sky full of brightness in the night, I never took so long to count stars in\
  \ one night. \nNow yes! It was all about them: the stars. Dinner in the improvised\
  \ dining room with a starry ceiling; the dances and the music, under the stars.\
  \ At midnight the song that began to sound said \u201Bshine bright like a diamond,\
  \ we are as  beautiful as diamonds in the sky\u2019 and it really was like that.\
  \ And finally the first shooting star appeared. \nBut I did not want to sleep even\
  \ though the sleepiness was about to win. I wanted to contemplate the sky as many\
  \ times as possible, keep images in my retina and hide them as a treasure that I\
  \ had finally found. \nIn addition, my room that night was nothing more or nothing\
  \ less than  the desert. An improvised room with a sleeping bag and a couple of\
  \ blankets. I am not going to lie, the cold was so strong that I doubted whther\
  \ to sleep in the open was a good idea or not. However,  that safe diamond roof\
  \ helped me put up with the cold. The view of that sarry roof was something I did\
  \ not want to miss. Then I just concentrated on counting shooting stars until I\
  \ fell  asleep, because I slept  in the White desert and no, do not ask because\
  \ you never imagine sleeping in the desert, but try it, it is an incredible experience.\
  \ Also, waking up with a movie dawn is beautiful. \nThe road continued and on  the\
  \ horizon I could see black mountains. The desert changed color, now it was black.\
  \ The mountains eroded until covering the desert with a layer of dust and black\
  \ rocks. And at the end of the desert there are volcanic mountains that, in ancienct\
  \ times, erupted. The desert can be seen from the route, but climbing  its rocky\
  \ mountains is an excellent option. \nWe have returned  to Ras El Bar, but I still\
  \ think about the diamonds, because in spite of everything, I now look at Egypt\
  \ with fleeting stars."
