Text: "\u201CAny Aloha vibes to share?\u201D In a shaky, anxiety ridden voice, I eagerly\
  \ asked. Living in my unsettled vulnerability, time was inching closer to my first\
  \ surfing adventure.\n\nThe island of Maui in Hawaii, a place where all the Gods\
  \ and Goddess have called home for eternity. With roaring rainbows glistening in\
  \ the sky and its painted paradise views of thick, hard volcanic rock overlooking\
  \ the vast red, white and black beaches. Palm Trees pose as statues like guards\
  \ strategically place throughout the land. They also act as a boarder between rogue\
  \ chickens wandering the streets and a grateful society living a humbled life, to\
  \ a vast openness of blue skies, with sandy beaches welcoming the warm crashing\
  \ waves of the South Pacific Ocean. Humming, harmonies of the \u2018Aloha Spirit\u2019\
  , a blessing practiced with all Hawaiians and locals. It means love, compassion,\
  \ kindness, responsibility, respect, loyalty, a committed practice towards yourself\
  \ and shared with others. You can feel it, the buzzing energy, like the fire that\
  \ boils the water in a pot. A bubbling sensation, brimming with higher awareness\
  \ that everything is, Aloha. \n\nOn my final day in the lively town of Lahaina,\
  \ tucked away was lovely Lahaina Beach. The fresh smell of salt water swirling in\
  \ the light breeze, the warm embrace from the sun\u2019s unwavering heat, which\
  \ tempts you and lures you to the bath-like water, entertaining a cooling relief.\
  \ My attention drawn to the water, all I could see were surfers gliding along the\
  \ waves with riveting grace and effortless techniques. Warriors of the water, surrendering\
  \ to mother natures gracious dance, as waves swallowed them whole. Pulled to the\
  \ ocean, I felt connected with the \u2018Aloha Spirit\u2019, or in other words \u2018\
  I felt 10 feet tall and bullet proof\u2019. I was ready for action and had decided\
  \ that my surfing adventure would be now. There was just one problem, I was terrified.\
  \ \n\n \u2018Be brave\u2019 I softly told myself as I walked up to a local stand,\
  \ towards the end of Front Street. I approached a rather charming young man who\
  \ shared a stunning resemblance to the Actor, Jason Momoa. You know the type, ruggedly\
  \ handsome guy, exuding cool island vibe confidence. He spoke with a calming low\
  \ voice, matched with an \u2018everything is going to be alright\u2019 tone and\
  \ slight Hawaiian accent. As he gave me the bright blue surfboard I\u2019d be renting,\
  \ I was freaking out internally. With the fear of surfing, or rather, with the thought\
  \ of being eaten by a wave and knock unconscious by ferocious rocks. This was happening.\
  \ Holy Shit. I\u2019m actually doing this. Surfing for me; I guess, is one of those\
  \ things you really want to do, so you put it on your bucket list, not really thinking\
  \ you will ever have the opportunity to try, so when it\u2019s time to actually\
  \ do it, you\u2019re like, \u2019oh fuck\u2019. I shared a similar experience when\
  \ I went skydiving. \n\n\u201CAny Aloha vibes to share?\u201D I squeaked, awkwardly\
  \ awaiting a response. This cool Jason Momoa dude, looked at me in wonderment and\
  \ gave me the biggest hug, as if we were life long friends. He forward massaged\
  \ my shoulders, like a boxer would receive from his coach, pepping him up before\
  \ getting back in the ring.\n\n\u201CIts all going to be alright, surfing is fun\u201D\
  \ reassuring me with each word. With a smirk he leaned in, as if to pass down a\
  \ secret that he\u2019s known for a lifetime. \u201CYou have a mental block right\
  \ now, from all the fear. Repeat after me. Fuck it!\u201D Amused by JM\u2019s \u2018\
  big brother\u2019 life advice pep talk, I played along meekly uttering to myself.\
  \ \u201CNo. Bigger. With all of yourself. Fuck It!\u201D he passionately bellowed.\
  \ Feeling the support from my new friend, I dug down deep and like a dragon breathing\
  \ fire to those words, \u201CFuck it!\u201D I screamed. Big Brother JM chuckled\
  \ and said \u201CNow you\u2019re ready.\u201D\n\nPaddling out, rushing waves before\
  \ me, I can feel the strong stiffness of the board holding my feather weight body,\
  \ gliding effortlessly along the rushing turquoise waters, I was a warrior. A thriving\
  \ freedom in each surf, I felt a sense of wholeheartedness in the Spirit of Aloha."
