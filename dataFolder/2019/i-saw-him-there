Text: "I saw him there. The beady eyed child staring at me, with a face marked with\
  \ mud and yellow booger so visible, Musa looked at his red plane and ran inside\
  \ to play with my son. Suddenly, three jeeps drove into our residential complex,\
  \ stopping right outside our neighbour\u2019s house. Wordlessly, the boy\u2019s\
  \ father hurried out in his uniform and left with them. My eyes followed the trail\
  \ left by the visitors in the moist mud of Jinja and I couldn\u2019t help wondering\
  \ what Idi Amin Dada Oumee would someday amount to in life. \nTen years later, I\
  \ found myself driving our Volkswagen to Kenya, forced to leave our homes overnight\
  \ and carry whatever we could squeeze in the car. My son was starting to develop\
  \ a high temperature, but the adrenaline rush kept every other inconvenience at\
  \ bay. The small town of Bungoma housed a boarding school that was run by Indians.\
  \ They kept the school open to anyone else fleeing Uganda who didn\u2019t mind their\
  \ bug-infested dormitories. \nThree months before, rebel groups had begun attacking\
  \ military establishments in the country. Two miles away from the Kenyan border\
  \ and three miles away from my son\u2019s boarding school, a military cantonment\
  \ was bombed. I gave my children strict instructions that if something like that\
  \ were to happen again, they should immediately run to the Kenyan border with their\
  \ friends, without looking back. They were ordered to not find a way to come home\
  \ but I promised them that their mother and I would find them wherever they were.\
  \ I even gave him special pants with a thick wad of Kenyan and Ugandan shillings\
  \ stitched to the inner lining of the inside of the thigh.\nI looked at my boy,\
  \ laughing with his siblings, unaware of the risk to his life if he was not treated\
  \ soon. Like an answer to an unspoken prayer, my wife rushed in with a bag of medicines\
  \ and relief written on her face. A nun had managed to get through the border skirmish\
  \ and smuggle in drugs under her habit for treating his jaundice. I was content.\
  \ We were together and safe. \nWe decided to drive back to Uganda after we heard\
  \ that the conditions were better. As we neared the Malaba border, I noticed men\
  \ at the border posts. Men with guns. A military jeep came towards us from the other\
  \ side. A man behind the driver started to lift his gun. My heart pounded faster\
  \ than it ever could, but everything around me turned dangerously slow. The machine\
  \ gun pointed right at me and his finger touched the trigger and..\n\u2018Woah!\
  \ Did he shoot you?\u2019 My grandfather stopped. Mildly annoyed at my interruption,\
  \ he smiled and carried on with his account. \nI saw him there. Sitting at his corner\
  \ table, under the steep attic stairs in the humid summer of Kerala, India. The\
  \ warm yellow light from his lamp stand lighting very little, but bouncing off his\
  \ wrinkled, well-worn skin.\nI saw them there. Students, colleagues and friends\
  \ from his school in Tororo attending the funeral. Each spoke of his influence,\
  \ kindness and affection during a turbulent time in Ugandan history. Although I\
  \ haven\u2019t stepped on African soil, I\u2019ve never felt more connected to the\
  \ culture and people of a foreign land before."
