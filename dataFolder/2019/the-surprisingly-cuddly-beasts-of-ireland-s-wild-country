Text: "I can barely make out the outline of his body. His jet-black fur juxtaposed\
  \ with the strikingly-green Irish grass makes him easy to spot, sure. But the speed\
  \ at which his legs carry him tire my eyes in keeping up.\n\nI had signed up for\
  \ this tour on a whim. Having lived in Dublin for two months, I felt familiar enough\
  \ with my new home to now venture on to one of many other, diverse parts of Ireland.\
  \ Connemara, known for its rugged coastlines and \u201Cwild\u201D scenery, seemed\
  \ like the perfect adventure.\n\nAs we turn off the main highway to head to the\
  \ farm, I find myself adjusting and readjusting my seatbelt. Our large van, full\
  \ of 12 curious travelers, is speeding down a one-lane road (with a significant\
  \ drop on one side) with very little care. Our tour guide cheerfully chats on as\
  \ the collective breath in the vehicle is held \u2013 all hoping to be on non-moving\
  \ land.\n\nOur wish soon comes true. After miles of nothingness, we see a small\
  \ barn ahead. A cheery man with a beard waves at us, as his Australian Shepard sits\
  \ dutifully next to him. The van door slides open, and I quickly find peace in the\
  \ crisp, country air.\n\nWe follow our new friends \u2013 Patrick the person and\
  \ Sean the dog \u2013 over to a fenced area next to the building. To my sheer delight,\
  \ there are a pair of four-day old lambs there to greet us.\n\n\u201CHow many of\
  \ you have ever fed a lamb?\u201D Patrick asks in a thick brogue.\nIn the mixed-nationality\
  \ group, none of us raise our hand. \n\n\u201CWould anyone care to?\u201D \nMy feet\
  \ volunteer me before my mouth has time to speak. \n\nPatrick smiles and hands me\
  \ a bottle. \u201CGo right ahead.\u201D\n\nFor a split moment, the spectators, the\
  \ hills, Patrick \u2013 all of that fades away. Now, it\u2019s just me and this\
  \ brand-new, little creature. \nSniffing hesitantly, the lamb shortly finds his\
  \ place on the end of my bottle, and I get the honor of gently stroking his soft\
  \ back as he feeds. \n\nOur moment is fleeting, as the lamb\u2019s stomach is soon\
  \ full. I give him one final pat, then stand up and rejoin the others in a circle\
  \ around Patrick. However, I notice one of the smaller members of our party missing.\
  \ The German woman next to me notices my wandering eyes and points to a far-off\
  \ hill. I follow her finger, squinting to see what she\u2019s describing. \n\nI\
  \ see herds of white sheep, but that\u2019s nothing unusual here. But then, I spot\
  \ him.\n\nSean\u2019s black figure seems even smaller among all the wooly sheep.\
  \ He sits among them, unmoving. Yet his pointed ears hint that he\u2019s anything\
  \ but relaxed. He\u2019s alert, ready \u2013 waiting.\n\nPatrick explains that he\u2019\
  s been training Sean for many years to be his prized sheep herder. He says Sean\
  \ knows more than fifteen different calls he can carry out among the sheep. \n\n\
  One of the travelers asks if Patrick uses a whistle to direct these instructions.\
  \ Patrick again smiles that small, humble smirk and shakes his head. \nHe then whistles\
  \ under his breath. To me, it almost sounds like a sigh. \n\nYet, the corner of\
  \ my eye catches a flash of black in the far hills. Sean is up and running, chasing\
  \ around the nearby group of sheep. \nAnother low whistle-whisper from Patrick,\
  \ and Sean is in front of the sheep, driving them back down towards us.\n\nWhistle\
  \ \u2013 dash left. Whistle \u2013 sprint forward. \n\nWhile Patrick and Sean perform\
  \ this dance, we astoundingly watch the pack of white animals quickly make their\
  \ way down the hill. Before long, they\u2019re right in front of us, tucked away\
  \ in their pen. Sean\u2019s in there with them, still standing guard. One pet from\
  \ Patrick signals his job is done, and Sean\u2019s tongue flies out of his mouth\
  \ while his tail wags affectionately. \n\nWith the sheep safely away, it\u2019s\
  \ now time for us to make our way to the next leg of the journey. I stutter my goodbye\
  \ to Patrick as we board the van, convinced we\u2019ve been witnesses to a great\
  \ magical demonstration.\n\nAnd yet, I know this is just life here in Connemara."
