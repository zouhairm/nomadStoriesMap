Text: "After bribing border control officers I\u2019m finally able to cross the Ivorian-Ghanaian\
  \ border without a visa. That\u2019s how the best 6-hour \u2018layover\u2019 country\
  \ discovery trip began. \n\nI crossed in Transua, a small village located in the\
  \ northeast of the Ivory Coast. Rosa, my Ivorian friend, took me to her home town\
  \ for a few days. A small land in the depth of the country, with soil as red as\
  \ Mars. A hidden gem behind small Mount Awabo covered in banana trees.\n\nTransua\
  \ is a 30-minute drive from the Ghanaian border. It took us close to 2 hours to\
  \ arrive. We took a baka, a small van that was as the driver said, \u2018always\
  \ 1km away from breaking down\u2019. A young woman with two boys was traveling in\
  \ the same baka. She only had money for one ticket. Rosa offered to carry one of\
  \ the boys on her lap so he wouldn\u2019t take up space and the driver agreed.\n\
  \nAfter packing the baka with 13 of us and 2 chickens under my seat we left to explore\
  \ the African roads, it was a bumpy ride. The young woman was sitting in front of\
  \ me, we didn\u2019t speak the same language but her leathery black eyes gave me\
  \ a scope of her struggles.\n\nRosa talked with her in Bron, an African language,\
  \ they were from the same tribe\u2013 Bron-Pinango, but were divided years ago by\
  \ the imaginary borders drawn by British and French colonialists. She was from Ghana\
  \ and was returning home after a week of work. Rosa gave banana chips to the boys\
  \ and they gave us the most genuine and loving smile a person can receive.\n\nAs\
  \ we approached the border, we passed a water well with a manual pump and a women\
  \ working on it. It looked like a postcard to me, the sky as blue as can be, the\
  \ woman being the focal point as she leant down pumping this ancient well surrounded\
  \ by trees and the earth's redness.\n\nWe arrived at the border. The driver stopped\
  \ abruptly and I began to feel butterflies in my stomach. No, I felt eagles flying\
  \ and elephants stomping. The only border I had ever crossed through land was the\
  \ Mexican-American border and I remember the exhaustive security to cross. Now I\
  \ was attempting to cross without proper documentation and with only some spare\
  \ francs to spend.\n\nTo my surprise as I got down, the only border-like symbols\
  \ I could see were some logs laying on the ground marking a division and a small\
  \ blue house on the right side of the road. The people got off the baka to cross\
  \ and no one asked for papers. To the naked eye crossing a street would seem more\
  \ complicated than crossing that border; naturally I followed everyone.\n\nSuddenly,\
  \ I heard someone behind me shouting \u2018BRUNI!\u2019 which is bron for white.\
  \ I looked around and clearly I was the only person they could be addressing. I\
  \ approached the officer with the biggest smile I had which he refused to register,\
  \ with a straight face he said \u2018Papers\u2019. I gave him my passport and he\
  \ turned and went inside the house without saying a word to me. I followed him inside\
  \ a blue room with naked walls and only the desk and chairs as furniture. I felt\
  \ on trial. A higher ranking officer joined Benjamin, the officer that spotted me,\
  \ and asked me to explain myself why was I attempting to enter a country I\u2019\
  m not allowed in without a visa.\n\nAs I explained the nature of my stay in the\
  \ Ivory Coast, which was volunteer work, their faces changed instantly. Their tones\
  \ softened and the higher ranking officer named George told me with an honest gaze\
  \ \u2018I only help the foreigners that help Africa\u2019. He agreed to let me in\
  \ under 3 conditions:\n\n- He retains my passport until I come back\n- I\u2019m\
  \ only allowed to stay for 6 hours\n- I have to pay them half of the visa fee\n\n\
  I agreed to the deal in an instant. Benjamin, George, Rosa, and I remain friends\
  \ to this day."
