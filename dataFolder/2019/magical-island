  Out in a dirty surfer bar in Bali, a guy called Big D an

  ex-convict with a huge, South Carolina-themed tattoo

  - told my friends and I about Gili Trawangan, a tiny,

  idyllic island where magic mushroom milkshakes are

  sold on the side of the road like it''s no big deal.

  The island is an early morning, two hour boat ride

  from mainland Bali.

  On arrival, the island has all the hallmarks of a

  postcard-perfect holiday destination: white sand,

  clear turquoise water, old German dudes in revealing

  swimwear, and an impossible amount of

  Scandinavian babes who look like they''re on vacation

  from the free-range beautiful people farm.

  The island is predominately Muslim, but most the

  teenagers living there are constantly chomping on

  mushies anyway.

  Also, there are no cars on Gili, only horse-drawn

  rickshaws. So, when you''re all high and start giggling

  about that thing that looks like a horse charging

  straight towards you, it is a horse charging straight

  towards you


  Apparently Gili Trawangan is the smallest island in

  the world with an Irish pub, which was equal parts

  hilarious and depressing.

  After two magical days at this Paradise our boat back

  to Bali came along and we drudge over the waves

  for two hours, feeling as though we were going to die

  at any minute.


  Oh sorry I didn''t mention much about our experiences

  here, I am sorry but my friends told me that what

  happened in Gili should stay in Gili'
