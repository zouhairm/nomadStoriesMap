Text: "I lay back on the thin foam mattress and take in my surroundings. The air reeks\
  \ of sweat. Humidity levels are high due to all the bodies and wet clothes. Also,\
  \ at 9pm, it\u2019s noisy. It\u2019s a typical nighttime albergue scene. The main\
  \ difference about this particular night is I find myself in a municipal albergue.\
  \ This means for five dollars a peregrino on their way to Santiago de Compostela\
  \ can secure a bed for the night and up to ninety-nine roommates. \n\nOne of my\
  \ Camino friends plops down in the bed I saved for him next to mine. Sergio, normally\
  \ upbeat, looks troubled and sad. \n\n\u201CI have his number, but I doubt we will\
  \ speak again.\u201D He looks down at his clasped hands.\n\nI am confused. He and\
  \ Mario seemed like they got along so well.  Just this evening I saw them walking\
  \ around town with their arms looped congenially around one another\u2019s shoulders.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWhat do you mean? Why not?\u201D I ask.  \n\n\u201CBecause we are men\
  \ and it\u2019s not supposed to matter. We have responsibilities. He lives in Spain\
  \ and I in Germany\u2026\u201D Sergio begins to trail off. \u201CEven though we\
  \ were only together for a few days, he became my friend, my brother. Now he is\
  \ gone\u2026\u201D \n\nUnlike Sergio and I who have plans of journeying all the\
  \ way across Spain to Santiago, Mario was only able to walk a portion of the Camino\
  \ de Santiago for Semana Santa. \n\n\u201CHe had to go back to his family, just\
  \ as I will have to soon.\u201D\n\nI wrack my mind for any words of comfort I can\
  \ manage. None come. Instead we launch into a discussion surrounding gender roles.\
  \ I know to a certain level there is great truth in what he says. Generally, grown\
  \ men with wives and children do not typically call one another to simply chat.\
  \ However, if they were women, his outlook on their relationship continuing might\
  \ be different. \n\nOur conversation continues past lights out. Sergio keeps verbally\
  \ processing his feelings about his new friend\u2019s departure. He struggles to\
  \ reckon with the intense familiarity which seems to almost instantaneously occur\
  \ with other peregrinos coupled with the temporal nature of it all. By the time\
  \ we\u2019re both drifting off to sleep he is still melancholy, but acknowledges\
  \ it is the way of the Camino. People continually pass in and out of ones\u2019\
  \ journey. \n\nI internally feel sadness spreading as he comes to this conclusion.\
  \ I know, and he knows, tomorrow we will wake up before dawn and walk our final\
  \ time together. Tomorrow I will be stopping after fifteen miles; he will be pressing\
  \ on for twenty-five. He is trying to get to a certain point to meet other friends\
  \ traveling from Germany to walk the last section with him. \n\nIn a similar way,\
  \ I know we too will not stay in close contact. He is in his mid-forties and I am\
  \ in my early twenties. Society would be suspicious of the friendship, of the motives,\
  \ not to mention what his wife might think. \n\nFor tonight though, we are privileged\
  \ to be only peregrinos. To be united by a common goal, instead of divided by our\
  \ assigned roles. For tonight, we lie bunk by bunk. \n\n\nSpanish to English: albergue\u2014\
  hostel only accessible by those walking the Camino de Santiago// Camino\u2014The\
  \ Way// peregrino\u2014pilgrim, what those walking the Camino de Santiago are called//\
  \ Semana Santa\u2014Holy Week, the week leading up to Easter."
