Text: "There's a list of places I expect to go after a casual lunch in the late autumn,\
  \ of them all, I wouldn't list being on the top of a mountain at sunset. But in\
  \ Hong Kong, I didn't expect to find a lot of things, in this city of contrasts.\n\
  \nSince coming back from living in Hong Kong for a single semester abroad, I get\
  \ asked a lot of times why I chose to go to this incredible city rather than the\
  \ more obvious choices for other students - Los Angeles, New York, Vancouver, even\
  \ closer to home like Paris or Berlin. Each time, I give a different answer. Why\
  \ did I want to go to Hong Kong? I've never really been intimidated by the thought\
  \ of being far away from home, and I couldn't find anything that appealed to me\
  \ elsewhere. It's not hard to be swept away by the common image of Hong Kong - built\
  \ up skyscrapers, clean trains, flashing neon signs down closed alleyways. Futuristic\
  \ science fiction and neon colours are so closely linked to cities like Hong Kong\
  \ that it's easy to forget that Pacific Rim is set specifically in Hong Kong, rather\
  \ than your average generic \"future city\".\n\nAnd was my image of Hong Kong met?\
  \ Sure, perhaps. I lived in a \"small\" eight-floor building. I never saw gum on\
  \ the MTR trains. My photography portfolio is bursting with bright city lights.\n\
  \nBut also, Hong Kong has a lot of unexpected moments. And this brings me to the\
  \ lunch date.\n\nMy friend and I had been planning to meet up for weeks - busy schedules,\
  \ exams coming up, trips abroad - and we'd finally settled on heading out to a restaurant\
  \ that she'd heard a review of. So far, so good, right? It was moving into winter,\
  \ but we'd been getting a string of uncharacteristically good weather, so she messaged\
  \ me - \n\n> Hey Lucy! The weather seems nice tomorrow, so I was wondering if you'd\
  \ like to climb up Lion's Rock after lunch? It should be an easy hike!\n\nLion's\
  \ Rock is a mountain based between Kowloon and the New Territories, and boasts wonderful\
  \ views at all times of day, and is popular enough to have well-marked trails for\
  \ someone who is great at walking (me) but less great at serious hiking (also me).\
  \ And it probably can be an easy hike. That is, provided you don't use Google Maps,\
  \ which sent us completely onto the wrong starting path. Four hours later, tracking\
  \ and backtracking and asking for directions from people on tiny back roads, we're\
  \ nearly there - we're so close to the top of Lion's Rock. And we're also so, so\
  \ close to sundown.\n\nSomething that really took me by surprise when travelling\
  \ to Hong Kong is the vastness of nature it contains. I hear so many stories about\
  \ how busy it is, how crowded, how the pavements are narrow and the buildings are\
  \ tall. How the rents are getting higher and the rooms are getting smaller. I hear\
  \ story, after story, after story, and they all imply the same thing: Get ready,\
  \ small town kid, because you're going to a real city now. \n\nThe reality? couldn't\
  \ be further from the truth. Hong Kong is full of national parks, of mountains and\
  \ beaches, of trails and paths and exploration away from people. And with the need\
  \ to build housing and transport to them on as much flat ground as possible, vast\
  \ natural beauty is so much more accessible to me there than it ever was growing\
  \ up in semi-rural England. Hong Kong gave me a love and an ability to hike that\
  \ I've never been able to find at home.\n\nI'm stood there, on the peak of Lion's\
  \ Rock, watching the sun go down. I could stand there and watch the streets, the\
  \ cars, the buildings all light up, a hubbub of activity I'd been warned would wear\
  \ me down. And it didn't, because all I could do was take a train and be here, the\
  \ top of a mountain, above the noise and people and cars. For a moment, I could\
  \ be away.\n\nAnd I didn't expect to find such beauty."
