Text: "I've always enjoyed going into the middle of nature, breathing the fresh air,\
  \ walking barefoot, watching the birds in flight, and to feel the soft\_breeze that\
  \ seems to blow straight through my spirit. It was summer vacation; some friends\
  \ and I had rented a farmhouse to spend a little time together. We didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find such a beautiful place so close to our hometown, so we decided to stay\
  \ there five whole days, until after New Year\u2019s. The landscape was beautiful.\
  \ The weather was humid, the sky blue without any clouds, and the mountains reflected\
  \ the brightness of the sun into our souls. From the yard, we could see several\
  \ plantations, farm animals grazing, and we felt a kind of peace that nourished\
  \ us.\n\_\nWe decided that, instead of sleeping inside the house, we would take\
  \ tents. There were too many people to rest in one place. We were fifteen people\
  \ and the house only had two rooms and two bathrooms. Still, it worked. We set the\
  \ tents up around the house, each of which sheltered a couple of friends. One of\
  \ these friends was a guy I was interested in. We\u2019d got there together (as\
  \ a couple) but we barely knew each other. I'd felt a little awkward about that.\
  \ I only knew that we had some connections and we were kind of enjoying being together\u2014\
  we had already hung out couple of times before. This is why I decided to go with\
  \ him.\n\_\nBeing the end of the year, we were all tired and in need to recharge\
  \ our energies. It was very clever of us to pick a spot in nature, one full of peace.\
  \ From my point of view, we are always being overwhelmed with information, tasks,\
  \ and responsibilities. If felt important that we stop and reflect for a moment\u2014\
  go in, and ask ourselves: What is really important to me? The more we know ourselves,\
  \ the better the choices we will make. We will then discover that happiness does\
  \ not come from external things, but from within.\u2014Those were continuous thoughts\
  \ of mine there\u2014the next year would come and good changes would follow with.\n\
  \_\nBeyond these reflections of mine, we all had a lot of fun. Every morning we\
  \ would wake up with the roosters\u2019 crows and the singing of the birds. We'd\
  \ make coffee and eat all together in the yard. Every afternoon we swam in the pool,\
  \ had barbecue, played games, drank tons of beer and rested in the hammocks. At\
  \ night, the guys would play some music while we stared at the starry sky drinking\
  \ whisky. \n\nThe entering of a new year is a powerful time to release what holds\
  \ us back\u2014a chance to press a reset button and start over. I was trying to\
  \ let go of what no longer serves me right and begin a new cycle; one with new dreams\
  \ and realities. As I sipped my drink and admired the view sitting quietly in a\
  \ corner, he came closer and started to sing and play some melodies. At every moment\
  \ he truly seemed dedicated to winning me over. At that moment I felt that I was\
  \ falling for it. He had a unique way to reach inside me. We spilled soft words\
  \ to each other expressing our feelings. I shared like I'd never done before, then\
  \ he surprised me with his beautiful writing\u2014a thing that really struck me\u2014\
  and it scored him another point. But the point is, we didn't expect to fall into\
  \ these mutual feelings. It scared us, but at the same time it brought up desires.\u2014\
  Our scores were evened out.\n\_\nThere was a moment when I stopped and went inward.\
  \ I sat in silence and listened to my inner voice\u2014We have the power to decide\
  \ who we want to be and in which reality we want to live in.\u2014Nothing feels\
  \ better than an honest connection with yourself, with nature, with a love. What\
  \ a great start for this new year. May it bring more balance, consciousness and\
  \ love. May we all be able to become the change we wish to see in the world."
