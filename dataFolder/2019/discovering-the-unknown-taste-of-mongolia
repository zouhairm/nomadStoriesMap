Text: "Two days after I came back from Mongolia, I got a phone call from a blood donation\
  \ center. They wanted me to give blood again. I give blood regularly and that is\
  \ why I knew that I probably had to wait about 26 days to be eligible again because\
  \ I visited a foreign country. I told the lady on the phone : \u201CI just came\
  \ back from Mongolia. It doesn't make 21 days, so...\u201D \u201CMongolia? Do you\
  \ mean China?\u201D I thought she was probably referring to Inner Mongolia that\
  \ is a region in China. \u201CNo, Mongolia.\u201D And I realized she probably didn't\
  \ know the country when she answered again: \u201CChina?\u201D\n\u201CNooooo. Mon.go.lia.\
  \ The independent country between China and Russia.\u201D\n\nI must admit I didn't\
  \ know much about this country myself before visiting it. When I found a deal on\
  \ the flight ticket \u2013 it was less than half the usual price! \u2013 I jumped\
  \ on the occasion and took a month off from work.\n\nEven though I checked some\
  \ basic facts on the country ; if it was secure to travel alone as a woman, the\
  \ weather so I can bring adequate clothes, etc. I felt like I didn't know enough\
  \ and I knew I would have a cultural shock. It was still a leap in the unknown.\n\
  \nMy mind is totally open for discoveries.\n\nIn Ulaanbaatar, I stay at a place\
  \ where some locals stay as well. Someone has dried cheese in the fridge. I ask\
  \ if I can taste. She is happy to share her culture with me. We eat dried cheese\
  \ together. I have the urge desire to spit it out. The taste reminds me of rotten\
  \ milk. She says that it's good cheese. I wonder if I can spit or it would be rudely\
  \ impolite for their culture. I keep the chunk of dried cheese in my mouth until\
  \ she leaves the room, but I am still open-minded. \n\nIt takes me some days to\
  \ be able to remember simple words. So, I give myself a challenge ; to learn a Mongolian\
  \ tongue twister. It sounds like if I repeat several times \u201Cyum yum\u201D and\
  \ \u201Cbong bong\u201D. It's a good ice breaker. I make people laugh, they have\
  \ a good sense of humor.\n\nSomeone tells me about \u201Chorse milk\u201D. It makes\
  \ me curious. I don't understand quite well what it is until I found myself in a\
  \ pub with a glass of the mysterious drink in front of me. Fermented milk from horses,\
  \ served as an alcoholic beverage. The smell is terrible. I can't take more than\
  \ a sip. They tell me to drink faster. It's worst. \n\nAnother day, I am going to\
  \ the supermarket. When I walk through the dairy products, a smell of rotten milk\
  \ comes to my nose. \u201CProbably from the dried cheese\u201D I think.\n\nI have\
  \ two weeks left. I am planning to go to Gobi Desert. They don't let foreigners\
  \ rent a car without a local driver. It's a good thing because in the following\
  \ week, my Mongolian driver got us lost in the desert twice in the same hour and\
  \ for a while. I would have died if I would have been alone. No WiFi, network or\
  \ whatever that could help a GPS working. A good (old) paper map. I guess the driver\
  \ spots tracks and find nomads so he can ask for the way.\n\nOf course, you have\
  \ to lower you standards when you're visiting the desert. No toilet or shower. You\
  \ don't even have a rock to hide. You have to develop techniques to pee regarding\
  \ the direction of the wind.\n\nAt one point, a Mongolian family who lives in the\
  \ desert offers me yogurt from their goats. I wonder if it will taste like dried\
  \ cheese. I put a lot of sugar. It's surprisingly good. They are happy I like it\
  \ and offer me more. Mongolians are surprisingly not judging. They want to understand\
  \ why you think differently (if it's the case) and they just shrug.\n\nMongolia\
  \ is a little bit less unknown for me now."
