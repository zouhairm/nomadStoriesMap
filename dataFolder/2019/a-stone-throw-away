Text: My trip to Swaziland was my first solo trip this was a trip for healing,marking
  my independence and trying to find a connection with a land that my ancestors once
  graced,one of smallest country in Africa, the country of Monarchy, Being Born and
  raised in South Africa, Pretoria a city that is six hours from Swaziland, i had
  an unsettling feeling that l had never been to my grandfather's country of birth
  which is a stone throw away, after recovering from a spinal injury which left me
  in wheelchair for a year, and needing assistance on every day activities, i felt
  i needed to regain my independence, confidence and to find emotional and mental
  clarity and embrace the Wanderlust in me and what better place to rebirth myself
  than the land of my greats, Mid January came i decided to take a shuttle to Ezulwini
  the six hour drive that left me in awe, being welcomed at the border by warm embrace
  of the soft spoken Swati people and warm drizzling rain the greener than green cultivated
  lands, among them houses distances apart among the low landscape i found myself
  passing through the misty mountains, magnificent rivers and streams,with the Clouds
  of all shapes and sizes kissing the mountains or should I say the mountains were
  scraping the sky, which embodies the full essence of the place's name Ezulwini meaning
  Heaven, i stayed at bed and breakfast Mogi Boutique hotel which is in the most quiet
  place away from the noise, yet near the greatest of local attractions, the hotel
  is surrounded by mountain rocks and trees barely recognizable from the road or entrance,
  with a pool at the highest point, that looks like an infinity pool distance, from
  my room the scenery was breath taking not mention the night sky i had never seen
  stars and moon shine so bright the clearest and purest of Skies i was overcome by
  emotion, i had found my contentment and with Open arms, a pure heart and enough
  South African Rands which are equivalent to the lilangeni the Swaziland currency
  the was no need to exchange currencies, i was ready to explore the great lands and
  an abundance of culture Swaziland, well the weather had other plans it rain all
  through out my stay, i was not complaining though no not with the great hospitality
  i got. Swaziland felt like home, so I  promised myself to return and explore the
  lands come rain or shine.
