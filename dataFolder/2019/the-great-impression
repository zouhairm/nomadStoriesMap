Text: "As soon as I set feet off the plane, I got the feeling I wasn\u2019t home anymore.\
  \ The first few steps gave me a sensation of liberty, freedom. I could be anything\
  \ I wanted, starting a new life is not an everyday thing. As I walked through the\
  \ airport with my backpack on one hand and a 2\u20AC coffee on the other, I was\
  \ amazed by the way every big brand I knew had different names and advertising and\
  \ product labels and (obviously) prices. Coca-Cola was there. Starbucks as well.\
  \ McDonald\u2019s, L\u2019Or\xE9al, and Disney. Gillette, H&M, and Nescaf\xE9. Everything\
  \ was different: menus in other language, different greeting words for the airport\
  \ personnel, special places you need to take in the electric escalator, and even\
  \ bathrooms had its unique features. I felt like a kid whose dad takes him to a\
  \ toy store for the first time, aroused by the endless possibilities this new place\
  \ could bring, and I was just so impatient to start.\nBut, as sooner or later happens,\
  \ reality hit, and gave me its well-known, world famous \u201Ctoo good to be true\u201D\
  \ strike, registered trademark. That thing that happens when everything is going\
  \ well and you thought it would stay like that. I arrived to the main luggage delivery\
  \ band and stood in front of the luggage parade, waiting for mine to appear. 5 minutes\
  \ passed. Then 10. 15. 20. Baggage of all colors and shapes danced in front of me,\
  \ like saying \u201CI\u2019m not yours, keep looking\u201D. When they stopped coming\
  \ out, I started feeling worried, scared. Moments before, I wanted to eat the world\
  \ from the palm of my hand, and now I wondered if I would be able to change clothes\
  \ any time soon. I had to fix this, so I went to baggage claim and asked for help,\
  \ but not one of the airport assistants spoke a word of Spanish, and their English\
  \ was the worst I have ever heard in my life. I was stranded there with no hopes\
  \ of giving my message across. I wanted to look for the office of my airline, but\
  \ as soon as I turned around this lad ran right into me and crashed his bags right\
  \ in my chest, exploding my cup of coffee into a big caffeine mess. My once white\
  \ sweater is now brown. He doesn\u2019t even apologize, just lifts his bags from\
  \ the floor and keeps on running towards one particular terminal I ignore.\nThis\
  \ couldn\u2019t be happening. I started wishing I had never stepped feet of that\
  \ plane, and regretting wanting to live abroad, far from my family, my friends,\
  \ the products with names I know and can pronounce, the coffee that is half the\
  \ price of the one that now covered my chest, or the people in airports I could\
  \ talk fluently to. Starting a new life is not an everyday thing, and that day at\
  \ that moment I didn\u2019t recommend doing so.\nThen, a French toasted miracle\
  \ happened. This girl came out of nowhere, 5\u20196 ft tall, red lips, Boston Red\
  \ Sox sweatshirt and, why not, a coffee from the same 2\u20AC store I got mine from.\
  \ She spoke Spanish so fluently I could have guessed she was Mexican, when actually\
  \ she was from some Eastern European country I hadn\u2019t heard from before but\
  \ would fancy visiting anytime. She had seen my despair and came to me offering\
  \ help to translate my words to the French people, and in less than 10 minutes I\
  \ had a compromise note from the airline so that they would return my luggage in\
  \ less than two weeks. Girl took a sip of her coffee, wished me good luck and got\
  \ lost in the sea of people and bags. After all, my day had taken quite a nice turn.\
  \ Days are bad, days are good. Life is unpredictable, such as the forms coffee foam\
  \ takes. But I could live with that. Starting a new life is not an everyday thing,\
  \ and I was just so impatient to start."
