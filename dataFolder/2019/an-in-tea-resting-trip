Text: "This adventure happened three years ago in 2016, our original plan was for\
  \ Seoul, Korea but with the change of events; having our visa denied for reasons\
  \ unknown up to this day... my husband and I with our community sister re-routed\
  \ to a visa-upon-arrival country to Bali, Indonesia. But still our tour provider\
  \ overlooked a few more details on our preferred dates that we ended up to a lesser\
  \ favorite (at that time) country - was Sri Lanka.\n\nI used to be an ESL (English\
  \ as Second Language) for Koreans, therefore to set-forth in Seoul is a dream come\
  \ true. Imagine the disappointment I had during that time, but I trusted the process\
  \ and moved on. I conditioned myself that it isn't the right time yet. I guess the\
  \ universe would want me to explore other countries first. So we settled and booked\
  \ for 5 days in Sri Lanka. \n\nOur trip looks like this:\nDay 1 - Arrival & Kandy\n\
  Day 2 - Sigiriya\nDay 3 - Galle\nDay 4 - Colombo\nDay 5 - Departure\n\nThe only\
  \ one activity that excites me in this trip was the encounter with the King of the\
  \ jungle - The Elephant. It was on our day 1 that we visited an Elephant Orphanage.\
  \ Where we were able to feed some of them, ride and a closer view of them. On the\
  \ same day, Sri Lanka took my heart when we visited a tea farm. It was an in-TEA-resting\
  \ moment for me as a tea lover. Seeing the process; how it is picked, prepared and\
  \ packed swept me away. Also, getting to taste it from the source is one of the\
  \ most amazing tea-tasting experience I ever had. I never thought that Sri Lanka\
  \ will make me fall in love in day one. \n\nDay 2, we ascend to Sigiriya Lion mountain\
  \ that took us into greater heights and saw the city from above. It was a long stride\
  \ of almost 4 hours but it was a memorable hike. Plus an opportunity to see a herd\
  \ of cows, elephants, migratory birds, a tiger and all other animals during our\
  \ Safari trip. \n\nDay 3 in Galle was a trip to a turtle farm and a sunset view\
  \ at Sri Lanka's Dutch canal. Before that, something else happened... I was surprised\
  \ that in the middle of our hotel area is a church! As a Christian, it's an answered\
  \ prayer for me because as I walk into the church, I heard His voice that this place\
  \ is my gift for you. \n\nDay 4 was going to the capital city in Colombo where I\
  \ was surprised how much motorcycle the city has. It's the main means of transportation\
  \ and we saw a sea of motorcycle in all colors and sizes. In fact, the small road\
  \ is covered with these motorcycles that it caused a real traffic just like how\
  \ we experience with cars back in the Philippines or in Abu Dhabi. \n\nFinally our\
  \ last day was spent only within the city center nearby our accommodation. We took\
  \ the train and saw a little of the province life, the green lands, and the farm\
  \ and of course we indulge into the culture by eating local food. Eventually headed\
  \ to the airport back to Abu Dhabi.\n\nLooking back, this in-TEA-resting trip was\
  \ really not in the original plan. Yet it's in unplanned moments that unforgettable\
  \ series of experiences produce memories worth remembering. So long Sri Lanka! Till\
  \ we meet again."
