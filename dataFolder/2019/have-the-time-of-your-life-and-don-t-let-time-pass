Text: "As seen in the great Disney movie \u201CFinding Dory\u201D, there\u2019s nothing\
  \ more frightening than going new places that you don\u2019t know nothing about\
  \ and putting yourself all in it. That\u2019s what I did when I went to live and\
  \ study all by myself in London, United Kingdom. A 18 year old guy that had never\
  \ gone out of his birth country, living alone in one of the most busy cities in\
  \ the world, that\u2019s kinda exciting but scary at the same time. I had my expectations,\
  \ I had my thoughts about how this part of my life would be and everything went\
  \ different, everything turned out to be so much more cool and so much more self-increasing.\n\
  Being a Brazilian and living in London was hard at the beggining, I was afraid that\
  \ people would laugh at me if I vocalized some word wrong or if I said something\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t. I was afraid that I would miss my friends and my home, I\
  \ was afraid that somehow I would end up wanting to go back home and letting this\
  \ great opportunity go but everytime that these thoughts would cross my mind, I\
  \ would make them go away and just mentalized: \u201CIt\u2019s a new life, everything\u2019\
  s different now. I\u2019m living in a rush, I can go anywhere taking the subway,\
  \ I can go visit the London Eye (which is the most beautiful attraction point in\
  \ London -in my oppinion-) anytime i want, so, go for it, John, take big steps and\
  \ don\u2019t be afraid to live and experience new things.\u201D And when i internalized\
  \ all that i used to mentalized inside of me, it all changed. Suddenly, I wasn\u2019\
  t afraid anymore, in a blink of an eye I was going places hours far from my home\
  \ and not even thinking about how would I go back, suddenly I wasn\u2019t that scared\
  \ Brazilian guy anymore, I was a man having the most self-increasing experiences\
  \ in a new city he'd know nothing about and just living the moment and making the\
  \ most of it. I was able to immerse myself in every experience that the United Kingdom\
  \ had to offer me. I was visiting the most beautiful places I\u2019ve ever seen\
  \ in my life, places like Camden Town, where I could see the district that Amy Whinehouse\
  \ used to live, places like the City Hall, where I could see the great Tower Bridge\
  \ and so many other places that only if you immerse yourself in the city you\u2019\
  ll know what\u2019s like and how it feels.\nLondon is a great city to get lost,\
  \ not lost in the literal sense of the word -but it's ok if you do, you'll end up\
  \ finding your way back in a couple of minutes- but lost like in the dream plan.\
  \ It\u2019s a city where everyone\u2019s polite and helpful, where the friends you\
  \ make will stand by you and join the crazy experiences you\u2019re wanting to have.\
  \ It\u2019s a place just like the Disney World \u2013 where dreams come true \u2013\
  . \nIn London you\u2019ll find everything you need and want to. In the sunny days,\
  \ you\u2019re able to go to great parks like Greenwhich Park and the Russell Square\
  \ Park. In the winter, you can visit Winter Wonderland and enjoy the cold in a perfect\
  \ ambient. But above of everything, London is a city that will always be open-armed\
  \ for you. No matter when, no matter how, no matter the ammount of money in your\
  \ wallet, London will always be with it\u2019s arms open to new tourists, new students,\
  \ new families and most of all, new people who want to have the time of their lives."
