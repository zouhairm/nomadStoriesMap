Text: "After meeting my friends in gurugram, I rented a car from there and drove towards\
  \ Agra. Since people out there will talk that delhi is not a safe place for girls\
  \ I totally disagree that statement because this trip taught that \"not all the\
  \ man out there are bad\". Since I started at midnight the fog was heavy. After\
  \ reaching the Agra express way I stopped for filling petrol. The bunk owner told\
  \ me not to go further because the weather was so bad. I got scared so started to\
  \ move further before reaching jewar I was stopped by highway patrol. The policemen\
  \ told me that there was an accident near brindhavan and advised me not to drive\
  \ in this climate. So they guided me to jewar toll and told me to stay there till\
  \ morning. so I halted near that place and found that so many people who headed\
  \ towards agra stayed back there.\_ Then after sunrise I said thank you and bye\
  \ bye to every new friends I got there. (Yes strangers who I met and celebrated\
  \ New year in jewar) I headed towards agra and finally saw the wonder and symbol\
  \ of love \"TAJ MAHAL\". I started clicking pictures.\_ later I went to market to\
  \ buy sweets and souvenirs(definitely a marble mini Taj). The famous one was \"\
  pethas\" which is available in many flavours where my favorite flavour is paan.\
  \ Then I started towards Agra fort. After roaming around the place where the jahampana\
  \ of mughals shahjahan spent his last day I returned towards delhi. On my way I\
  \ ate hot jalebis which are my all time favorite and met my friends. Then spent\
  \ the new year night with them and returned to airport with heart full of memories\
  \ to catch my early morning flight.\n#atripthatchangedmylife #lifechangingtrip"
