Text: "As an undergraduate student learning Spanish in the U.S., I decided to improve\
  \ my knowledge of the language by studying in Guadalajara, Mexico one summer.  This\
  \ was my first time travelling abroad, so I wasn\u2019t sure just what to expect.\
  \ Fortunately, my host family was very welcoming. Both the father and mother, as\
  \ well as two brothers, made me feel right at home in their comfortable middle-class\
  \ house.\n\nI had a great time exploring the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan,\
  \ discovering the colonial town of Guanajuato, learning about historic Mexico City,\
  \ and enjoying the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta. I also got to learn about Guadalajara\
  \ and its place in Mexican history and culture. However, one of the most meaningful\
  \ experiences I had was something that didn\u2019t involve any of Mexico\u2019s\
  \ famous tourist sites.\n\nInstead, it took place in a small, rural town where my\
  \ host mother and father grew up and still had family. They took me there one weekend\
  \ to meet their family and see the town. It was located in a lush valley that epitomized\
  \ the word  \u201CMexico\u201D in my mind: verdant hills, agricultural fields surrounding\
  \ the town, with cattle grazing in a nearby pasture. Unlike in Guadalajara, I was\
  \ probably one of the few foreigners who had visited the town. Of course, I stuck\
  \ out like a sore thumb, but my host family\u2019s relatives welcomed me warmly\
  \ with a never-ending banquet of local food and drink, including marinated pig intestines\
  \ and lots and lots of tequila. \n\nAfter a fun day of getting to know the family,\
  \ milking the cows, playing basketball, and eating and drinking, we staggered back\
  \ to the house to continue the evening\u2019s festivities. After enjoying a few\
  \ more drinks, I decided to get some food from a nearby street vendor, so my host\
  \ mother sent her youngest son, Luis, with me to make sure I made it there and back.\
  \ Luis was only six years old at the time, and had only gradually taken a liking\
  \ to me during my six-week stay with his family. This was understandable from his\
  \ perspective, because he probably thought it was odd to have this stranger who\
  \ could not speak Spanish suddenly move into his house.\n\nSo Luis accompanied me\
  \ as I visited the street vendor to get some food. As we approached the stand, I\
  \ saw that there was a little girl at the food cart as well as the owner. When I\
  \ opened my mouth to order some food, the little girl must have been surprised by\
  \ my language ability (or lack thereof) and my accent. My Spanish was still pretty\
  \ shaky\u2014and especially so after a day filled with a little too much tequila\u2014\
  and whatever I said apparently sounded pretty funny to her, so she started laughing\
  \ at me. Of course, it did not faze me; if I were she, I would have laughed at me,\
  \ too. \n\nSurprisingly, it did bother Luis. When the girl laughed at me, I could\
  \ see his face turn into a scowl as he tightened his fists. Although he did not\
  \ say anything to her, he clearly did not like the little girl laughing at me. Formerly\
  \ standoffish Luis was now defending me! \n\nOf course, his defense of me from the\
  \ laughter of others did not prevent him from laughing at me later that evening\
  \ when I saw fireflies\u2014a new thing for someone from Arizona\u2014and said excitedly,\
  \ \u201C!Mira! !Moscas de Fuego!\u201D, literally \u201CLook! Flies of Fire!\u201D\
  \ After he stopped laughing at me, he informed me that the correct word was \u201C\
  luciernagas\u201D, a word that I remember to this day. So even though he didn\u2019\
  t like other people laughing at the strange things his gringo said, it didn\u2019\
  t stop him from doing so. We had a good time, Luis and I\u2014and I learned a new\
  \ word.\n\nWhen it was time for me to leave Guadalajara a couple weeks later, Luis\
  \ had gone from keeping his distance from me at the beginning of my stay to getting\
  \ teary-eyed as we said our goodbyes. While I love Mexico, and subsequently have\
  \ travelled there often, those memories of bonding with Luis will always be among\
  \ my fondest travel memories."
