Text: "As I see the signal showing the way for a possible detour from the central\
  \ road, my steps naturally walk that way, my face\u2019s smiling and I start wondering\
  \ about the reason of its name: \u201CVariante Espiritual\u201D. \nI'm heading to\
  \ Armenteira, Galicia; 25 kilometres going up in the mountain, in an extraordinary\
  \ cold and rainy morning of early June. As I walk up in the wind, I start to understand\u2026\
  \nThe raindrops cover my face and I\u2019m smiling and, out of the blue, it comes\
  \ the weeping. Redemption. Purification. \nGet lost in the mountain it\u2019s part\
  \ of the process, I guess. Well I do, and I\u2019m not afraid; the rain feels soft\
  \ and thin on my face now. I am one with the rain, the woods, the nature. I challenge\
  \ the thick fog, in which everything becomes immaterial and mysterious; I would\
  \ have been afraid. I challenge the ceaseless climb which is now tied to my fingers\
  \ and drags me up to the peak. \nWhen everything is over, the downhill starts and\
  \ it\u2019s not easy. The Camino\u2019s yellow arrows are now ancillary: I\u2019\
  m already seeing all clear. I climbed and I descended, I died and I rose up. I\u2019\
  m a pilgrim and this was one of the most intense day in my whole life, the reason\
  \ I firstly decided to begin this journey, to recognize and accept my inner self.\n\
  The Camino Portuguese from Lisbon to Santiago de Compostela is not a proper travel,\
  \ it would be silly to define it so. I started alone and, with more than 700 kilometres\
  \ under my feet and on my shoulders, I arrived in Santiago full of thoughts and\
  \ life\u2019s memories of the people I found along the way: I arrived and I felt\
  \ the richest person in the universe. \nI understood the misery of a father who\
  \ lost his child and worships the mother nature to find some kind of pureness in\
  \ his pain. I understood the frustration of a South-Africa woman who saw her land\
  \ farmers\u2019 life destroyed by a dictatorship and irrational discriminatory feelings.\
  \ I understood the disorientation of young people from Europe, dealing with what\
  \ they were supposed to think and make according to society and community obvious\
  \ opinions; and their goodness, which was so deep and true. I understood the meaning\
  \ of \"kindness\", by waking up at 5 am in the morning trying not to bother your\
  \ roommates still sleeping. I understood the meaning of acceptance, as I left home\
  \ with an outstanding depressive disorder and anxiety and I found people from Australia\
  \ and Brasil and Canada and Africa and Portugal and Czech Republic and United Kingdom\
  \ and Italy loving me from the very first steps, and going back (Pilgrims\u2019\
  \ blasphemy) to help me out with my sore leg. I found the meaning of tolerance.\
  \ \nI arrived in Santiago the Compostela, Galicia, Spain, on June the 3rd. I sat\
  \ down in the square in front of the Cathedral, and I touched every part of my body\
  \ because I needed to feel it was actually me, I needed to touch my existence, and\
  \ I cried and cried.."
