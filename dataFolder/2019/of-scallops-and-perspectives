Text: "Close your eyes. Breathe in. Breathe out. One more time, just to convince yourself\
  \ you can make it. Two feet on land. One foot on the dock, one on the boat. Two\
  \ feet on the small green and white fishing boat that was going to take me and other\
  \ fellow travellers across the seawaters of Loch Carron to harvest and taste wild\
  \ scallops with a Highland fisherman at sunrise. Exciting, right? Except for my\
  \ inseparable travel buddy \u2013 Mal de Mer \u2013 and my legendary lack of coordination.\
  \ Except that I am not exactly a fan of fish. Especially of shellfish. Especially\
  \ if it\u2019s raw. \n\nYet, there I was, defeating the limits of my comfort zone\
  \ and testing the resistance of my stomach. As the waves swayed the boat, Alasdair\u2019\
  s work-worn hands were trying to steady me in my constant battle to keep balance.\
  \ Clad in waterproof orange jacket and trousers, the fisherman was looking down\
  \ at me, his light blue eyes lit by an encouraging smile, the intense smell of saltwater\
  \ tangled in his ruffled white hair. \u201CDon\u2019t fret lassie\u201D, he reassured\
  \ me, \u201Cye\u2019ll learn our strange seagoing dance soon enough\u201D. \n\n\
  As I was getting the knack of it, we gathered all the life we borrowed from that\
  \ sea-loch nested in the west coast of the Scottish Highlands on the deck of Alasdair\u2019\
  s boat. Our search for the fan-shaped shells of scallops could begin. \u201CThat\u2019\
  s a bloody henry,\u201D Alasdair explained, pointing at the small purply-red starfish\
  \ wriggling on the palm of my hand; \u201Cand that a wee long-legged spider crab,\u201D\
  \ as we looked at the tiny creature dancing through the fingers of an Argentinian\
  \ girl standing near me. Scanning that diverse mass of sea life, we found many grey\
  \ and drab shells, others vivid and multi-hued. Alasdair threw the smallest ones\
  \ back into the water. \u201CDon\u2019t take more than you need,\u201D he warned\
  \ us. With an expert hand, he severed the molluscs from their shells and offered\
  \ us some to try. Close your eyes. Breathe in. Breathe out. I reached out my hand.\
  \ The rich, delicious taste of fresh scallops exploded in my mouth. \n\nThere was\
  \ no touristy storytelling for us that morning. Alasdair\u2019s thick accent and\
  \ rolling \u201CR\u201D narrated only the enchanting underwater world. On his boat,\
  \ surrounded by young travellers from all over the world, I realised Scotland was\
  \ so much more than a Macbethian place where the limits between the legends and\
  \ the real are blurred and unearthly creatures roam its heather-covered moors unperturbed.\
  \ It emerged as a complex land of contradictions and conflicts, a nation that only\
  \ a couple of years before silenced the voices of the ancestors and their patriotic\
  \ ideals to choose unity over independence. A country that made of multiculturalism\
  \ and diversity its strength but that was irrevocably going down the path of isolationism\
  \ because of another referendum whose result was still baffling. Yet there we were,\
  \ a bunch of foreigners welcomed into a fragment of this man\u2019s life. I saw\
  \ myself at the UK border holding on to my EU passport, leaving the Union behind\
  \ to enter a hostile country. I thought of all the people leaving their countries\
  \ behind in a desperate attempt to reach the shores of my own country, hoping for\
  \ a better life on the Italian soil. I saw us united by the strenuous search for\
  \ better opportunities, different yet identical. From that unfamiliar, unexpected\
  \ stance, switching perspective was so easy, my sight so clear.\n\nClose your eyes.\
  \ The tireless wind of Scotland hugged me; the early morning sun kissed my skin.\
  \ Breathe in. The smell of the sea, the crisp morning air in your lungs, the salty\
  \ taste of scallops on the tip of your tongue. Breathe out. Open your eyes to take\
  \ it all in. The pearly, translucent light of dawn; the young morning mist playing\
  \ hide and seek among the mountains, the vibrant blue of the bottomless Highland\
  \ sky in early spring, impossibly white clouds reflected on the deeper blue of the\
  \ waters of Loch Carron. Breathe in. Breathe out. One more time. Just to convince\
  \ myself that I was actually there. In that exact moment. In that exact place."
