Text: "Breathe. Inhale and exhale. Leaning on the train window, I tried my very best\
  \ to quit scolding myself.\n\nThat morning, I had rushed through the str\u0103zi\
  \ of Bucharest with my backpack, running late for a six-hour-long train.\nAs I laid\
  \ foot on the heated wagon, a complete stranger blocked my way, seeking support\
  \ for a mass-casualty incident. While I stood, confused, the guy persuaded me to\
  \ give him a hundred lei \u2013 all the cash I had \u2013 and then vanished. It\
  \ hit me in a matter of seconds: that was definitely a fraud.\nHow I was so easily\
  \ cheated, though, I couldn\u2019t tell.\n\nI sank into a seat, pissed with myself\
  \ \u2013 and wishing I could stop replaying in my mind the voices of all the skeptical\
  \ people I had to deal with before my trip.\n\u201CSeriously, solo travel in Romania?\
  \ Can\u2019t your friends stick with you after going to Hungary and Poland? How\
  \ will you get around?\u201D\n\nI tried to clear my thoughts and grasp the situation.\
  \ I did not want to spoil my journey, after all.\nAdjud \u2013 I had to remember\
  \ to change there, and get on a ride to Com\u0103ne\u0219ti. Taking some deep breaths,\
  \ I peeked through the scratched glass to distract myself. \n\nAmid the people hurrying,\
  \ a middle-aged woman stood out. She was waiting on the wagon steps, speaking with\
  \ another woman on the verge of tears. A blurred, captivating scene.\n\nThe train\
  \ whistle broke their moment. While the passenger stayed on the train, the other\
  \ lady eagerly waved to her, crying and smiling, until she disappeared, together\
  \ with the platform.\nAs the pace got faster, the woman who got on board sat in\
  \ my same row. She put her bag by her feet, sighed, and looked at me. I smiled,\
  \ oblivious to how that could lead to a wider conversation.\n\nShe cheerfully began\
  \ speaking Romanian. Being a native Italian helped a lot, in the previous days \u2013\
  \ the languages are so similar I could just communicate in my tongue and get Romanian\
  \ comebacks. However, for as much as I tried my best, I couldn\u2019t properly interact.\n\
  As I stammered something in response, my counterpart blinked and suddenly switched\
  \ to Italian.\n\n\u2013 Are you from Italy, dear? \u2013 she asked me, with a slight\
  \ accent.\n\nMaria Ana, 66 years old French teacher on retirement, had a daughter\
  \ living in my country. That\u2019s where her skills came from, together with linguistic\
  \ closeness to both Romanian and French \u2013 plus, a stubborn curiosity that led\
  \ her to know as much as possible in the harshness of Romania\u2019s postwar regime.\n\
  That same regime, though, divided her from a childhood friend, someone she had not\
  \ seen for about 50 years.\n\n\u2013 I never thought we would see each other again,\
  \ \u2013 Maria Ana confessed \u2013 But she managed to get in touch and we have\
  \ finally met this weekend. Oh, she is so nice; did you get to see her?\n\nIndeed,\
  \ I saw her. \n\n\u2013 Do you want a sweet bun? When you travel, food is essential.\n\
  \nAs I try to answer that I do have some snacks for the ride, she pulls out a box\
  \ from her bag, insisting that I\u2019d pick up whatever was inside. How could I\
  \ decline?\n\n\u2013 My friend prepared it for me. \u2013 She explains with a nostalgic\
  \ hint, waiting for me to taste \u2013 I didn\u2019t expect to grow so attached\
  \ to her once more.\n\nA delicious bread, probably made with potato or a similar\
  \ starch. With no way to thank her but words, I kept sharing everything Maria Ana\
  \ would come up with, from her food to a wider journey than the one we were on.\
  \ I saw history through her eyes, debunking the years under Ceau\u0219escu better\
  \ than any book.\n\n\u2013 Train stations are still a mess, though. I\u2019ll make\
  \ sure the Chief helps you getting off safely in Adjud. He was a student of mine,\
  \ you know. I could name everyone I taught in 25 years.\n\nThe love for her husband,\
  \ a Spanish teacher with a cooking flair, and the lives of her children, scattered\
  \ throughout Europe, enriched her tales.\nAs we discussed over future hopes, advices\
  \ and past encounters, time flew by.\n\nThose nice buns were no match for such sweet\
  \ woman."
