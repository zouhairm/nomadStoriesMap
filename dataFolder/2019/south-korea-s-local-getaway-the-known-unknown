Text: "Off the coast of South Korea is a popular getaway for most South Korean locals\
  \ and a landfill of curiosity for travelers. If you tell locals you are going to\
  \ Jeju Island, you are bound to get a \u201CAhhh\u201D or \u201COhhh\u201D at the\
  \ center of their playful envy (or is it?)\n\nThe island has maintained its natural\
  \ landscape more than the mainland. With crisp blue and grey seas and white sands\
  \ the island makes the coast seem desirable and pleasurable in summer and in winter.\
  \ Moving inland you will find sheets of greenery leading up mountains and down valleys,\
  \ and mountains of brown and green leading you on a visual rollercoaster. The whole\
  \ island from coast to the center is a marine rainbow, however, not exempt from\
  \ the concrete jungle of high-rise buildings.\n\nJeju Island is Korea\u2019s largest\
  \ island known for its National World Heritage Sites: Halla Mountain (the highest\
  \ mountain in Korea), the Geomunoreum lava tubes (formed by basaltic lava that passed\
  \ beneath the earth\u2019s surface) and Seongsan Ilchubong, formed by an underwater\
  \ eruption on the shallow sea bed 5, 000 years ago.\n\nThe island is also the country\u2019\
  s smallest province. It boasts a budding tourist economy with many Korean residents\
  \ using their long weekends as an opportunity to getaway since the only way of the\
  \ peninsula and into mainland is through North Korea which is near impossible. \n\
  \nOne could get on a plane and fly two hours to the closest countries for a short\
  \ holiday, but South Koreans are filled with civic pride and local tourism is revered.\
  \ Jeju Island offers the perfect getaway if you are trying to escape from the fast\
  \ and commercial pace of the mainland aided by its large and growing economy.\n\n\
  The island boasts a multitude of unique sights \u2013 both man-made and natural.\
  \ It is home to the Jeju Loveland Museum \u2013 sure to bring giggles when mentioned\
  \ to some locals. The adult theme park features a sexciting experience that contrasts\
  \ the very conservative Korean nature. It is filled with phallic and labial monuments,\
  \ enough sex positions to get you thinking and enough triggers for your senses to\
  \ give you ideas.\n\n Jeju Loveland is the perfect opportunity to tour and up your\
  \ sexual knowledge (and skills. There\u2019s an indoor sex museum, as well as a\
  \ sex paraphernalia stall hall (that features a video viewing for the interested).\
  \ The theme park is colourful and there are some things you can climb, ride or sit\
  \ on \u2013 made to appeal to your adult senses and some very hilarious (or controversial)\
  \ pictures.\n\nHowever, if you are not up for Jeju Loveland or are not ready to\
  \ introduce your kids to plastic figurines enacting the Kama Sutra, your family\
  \ can visit a few, if not all, of the waterfalls on the island. The most famous\
  \ waterfalls being the Cheonjiyeon Waterfalls \u2013 three waterfalls surrounded\
  \ by rocky formations and heights of green - the physical beauty of seeing these\
  \ waterfalls matches the work required to be put in. If you are not up to putting\
  \ in a workout, however,  walking around and crossing the Seonimgyo Bridge at Cheonjiyeon\
  \ Valley and throw a coin in the fountain to make a wish. \n\nHike up Halla Mountain,\
  \ the peak allowing you to stare down into the Ilchubong Crater. The hike up the\
  \ mountain is well worth it once you sit down and get to stare down at the wistful\
  \ green of the crater and look up into the beautifully blue stretch of the sea\u2019\
  s horizon. The walk down the mountain is equally rewarding with a view of the mountains,\
  \ rocks and the sea in a perfect harmony and a horse ride at the base of the mountain.\n\
  \nAfter your hike, trek down to the sea side, sit on the rocks while you dip your\
  \ feet in the cool waters of the sea and watch sea life hustle and bustle at your\
  \ feet. If you\u2019re lucky, you might catch a show from Jeju\u2019s own mermaids\
  \ before they go in to catch some seaweed and you can end your trip with a sunset\
  \ in the horizon, water at your feet and a knowledge of leaping into the known unknown."
