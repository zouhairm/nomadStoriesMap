Text: "The light afternoon drizzle turned to solid rain in the early evening and became\
  \ a pounding storm by the time Liz and I had crawled into our sleeping bags. In\
  \ the middle of the night I ventured out to find the toilet tent. It had blown away.\n\
  \nWasn\u2019t Morocco supposed to be hot and dry? \n\nIn the morning we joined the\
  \ other seven members of our tour group in the dining tent. Water flowed under our\
  \ feet. Amazingly, even in these conditions, the crew still managed to provide us\
  \ with a solid hot breakfast. We needed it. We were three days into a five-day hike\
  \ in the Atlas Mountains, but now we were facing the hardest bit \u2013 a long,\
  \ slow slog up a steep slope right into the face of the wind and bucketing rain.\n\
  \nThe previous days had been spent in balmy sunshine. The mountain views were spectacular,\
  \ the many herds of goats fascinating, the cool mountain air invigorating. So agreeable\
  \ were the conditions that we almost resented the wet weather gear we had weighing\
  \ down our packs. \n\nNow we were wearing all of it.\n\nAs we set off, the crew\
  \ began breaking up the camp and loading tents and equipment onto the mules. They\
  \ seemed unfussed by the weather. Was it just another day in the mountains for them?\
  \ Probably. They were local Berbers, so maybe it was in their genes. But I couldn\u2019\
  t help but admire how relaxed they seemed to be, even though they wore only the\
  \ flimsiest of raincoats and the simplest of shoes. \n\nThe guide tried to keep\
  \ us moving at a steady pace, but the line soon began to stretch out. Liz and I\
  \ were at the back and found ourselves being overtaken by the mules and their handlers.\
  \ With all of us half blinded by the rain, one of the mules bumped into Liz, sending\
  \ her sprawling into the mud. Bruised but unbroken, she trudged on.\n\nHalfway up\
  \ the hillside, I discovered that my much-loved hiking boots had reached their use-by\
  \ date. Water was seeping in at the seams. Every step was now a cold wet squish.\n\
  \nThen, after two hours of leg-numbing slog, a miracle occurred. The rain stopped.\
  \ The wind fell to a whisper. The sun appeared. And there we were, at the top of\
  \ the climb, looking over snow-capped mountains in every direction. It was glorious.\n\
  \nGreat, we thought, it would be easy from here. Except for one thing. Yes, the\
  \ rain had stopped. But, as we discovered a few kilometres later, the creeks had\
  \ flooded. And we were now confronted by a raging torrent that the previous day\
  \ would have been a gentle stream.\n\nWith our guide leading the way, we locked\
  \ arms and waded in, water rushing around and above our bellies, making it across\
  \ as a single unsteady unit. As the mules and our crew followed in our damp footsteps,\
  \ we wrung out our socks and set off again. Only to find we had three more flooded\
  \ creeks to cross.\n\nYou had to laugh. And we did. We suddenly realised we were\
  \ enjoying ourselves. Me. My wife. All nine of us. Enjoying the hardships together.\
  \ It was fun. And really, how much of a hardship was it? We got wet. We got tired.\
  \ But we weren\u2019t at risk. We weren\u2019t going to die. And the end of the\
  \ day, with the camping part of the trek completed, we would reach a village where\
  \ soft beds and a good meal would be waiting for us. \n\nOr not, as it turned out.\
  \ \n\nWe couldn\u2019t cross the last flooded creek to reach those soft beds. Too\
  \ deep. Too wild. So the guide found a half built village house for us to bed down\
  \ in. The late afternoon was spent relaxing in the sun, drying our boots and clothes,\
  \ and playing with the local children who found us very amusing.\n\nAlso, through\
  \ an unfortunate miscommunication with the cook, we were served a dinner that featured\
  \ icing sugar on pasta rather than on the donuts he\u2019d also prepared for us.\n\
  \nThat's what travel is all about. New experiences. And enjoying them even when\
  \ things don\u2019t go to plan."
