Text: "Alfriston, it was a small village with nothing much in it. Apparently we were\
  \ suppose to go see a thatched roofed house. We parked on the side of the road,\
  \ there didn\u2019t seem like there was much here. It was disappointing. The hour\
  \ drive didn\u2019t seem worth it. \n\nWe walked into the centre of town. I found\
  \ it hard. I had been in England for two weeks now and I was still getting used\
  \ to the idea of narrow footpaths. It could see a few shops littered around the\
  \ town square. We walked past an ice cream shop and onto a back-ally like street.\
  \ At the end of the street I could see the village green. The green was hardly green,\
  \ patches of yellow and brown stuck out due to the intense heatwave that had been\
  \ going for a few days. Directly ahead was a church, it stood tall and proud on\
  \ a small hill, the church would have been at least a couple of centuries old. To\
  \ the right across the green was a thatched roofed house.\n\nMum walked up to the\
  \ sign outside the house and frowned. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201D I\
  \ asked. \n\n\u201CIt closed on Mondays.\u201D She replied. \n\nI feIt annoyed.\
  \ We had made the trip out here and the stupid house was closed. My frustrations\
  \ were instantly lost as I looked at my brothers running through the green. I smiled\
  \ and instantly joined in the game of tag. I regretted wearing my jeans and sandals.\
  \ \n\nMy brothers furiously shook their heads at the idea of going into another\
  \ church. That was another thing I would never get used to in England, their churches\
  \ were just open all the time and anyone could go in. While in England, every town\
  \ or village we went to, it was a must for us to have a look in the church. I enjoyed\
  \ the experience, but my brothers did not (there was only a certain amount of churches\
  \ that you could take someone to before they got bored). \n\nI barrelled down the\
  \ streets, already wanting to get back to the car. I looked around at the small\
  \ town and then something caught my eye. It was what appeared to be a shed of books.\
  \ I told my parents that I wouldn\u2019t be too long. Once inside I saw books everywhere.\
  \ There was a couple of bookshelves and a table in the middle piled with books.\
  \ I gave a quick browse to the books. Emma by Jane Austen stuck out. I almost grabbed\
  \ the book when I saw a lone collection of three books sitting at the end of the\
  \ shelf. The moment I was the author, I picked up the three books. Julius Caesar,\
  \ Othello and Hamlet where all there. Fulled with happiness, I jumped into the air,\
  \ clutching the books closely to my chest, as if they were to disappear. \n\nI looked\
  \ for a counter, but struggled to find one. I realised that there was a trailer\
  \ a head. Cautiously, I walked into the trailer, I had no luck in finding a counter,\
  \ but I did find a whole lot of reference books. Looking around, I spied a shop\
  \ of sorts. I decided that would be my best bet in my quest to find a counter. The\
  \ small smile I had one my face grew when I walked in. \n\nIt was like I had fallen\
  \ down a rabbit hole and into a wonderful world filled with books. There were books\
  \ of various genres that lined the shelves. \nEverything from science to Harry Potter.\
  \ It was all here. I managed to spare a glance at a book on a shelf. It was a beautiful\
  \ copy of Peter Pan. Finally, I had found the counter. The women at the counter\
  \ gave me a friendly smile. \n\nShe opened the covers of the books and carefully\
  \ jotted some numbers down. \u201CThat will be six pounds.\u201D \n\nAstounded at\
  \ the price I quickly gave her the money. For books like these back home, you were\
  \ looking at a paying eight-fifty each. She wrapped them in some brown paper.\n\n\
  \u201CThanks.\u201D I said as I joyful clutched the books to my chest."
