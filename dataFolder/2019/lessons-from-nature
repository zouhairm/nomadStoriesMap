Text: "And the water lulled me to sleep\u2026..\nAn alien place, no beds or sleeping\
  \ bags and just friends for company: my first ever full day \u2018away from home\u2019\
  . \n\u2018Lulled to sleep\u2019 does not sound appropriate here, does it?  However,\
  \ it was and still is the most peaceful sleep I ever had..\n\nSo, once upon a time\u2026\
  ..\n\nWe were in Himachal Pradesh, a small hilly province nestled within the Himalayas\
  \ of North India: Manikaran Sahib-a unique destination as it housed both a Sikh\
  \ (Gurudwara) and Hindu (Mandir) place of worship on the same premises.  Exhaustion\
  \ from the entire day combined with our late arrival ensured that it was three o\u2019\
  \ clock in the morning before we were able to retire for the night. Extremely certain\
  \ about tossing and turning the whole night and not sleeping a wink, I told my friends\
  \ to shake me awake in the morning if I slept in.\n\nAnd then\u2026.the water lulled\
  \ me to sleep\u2026\u2026\n\nFive-thirty in the morning and I awoke when a particularly\
  \ large wave left a misty-dewy water drop on my cheek flying through the tiny window\
  \ on my left. Tiptoeing to the balcony, the sound of water was magnified at least\
  \ three times outside the cozy little room. Just like at night, I could not help\
  \ being overwhelmed by the roaring of the mighty river Beas rushing to join its\
  \ source downhill. Strangely enough, the sound was not jarring but pleasant to the\
  \ ears; it felt like music of Gods enveloping us with their protection and warmth.\n\
  \nBillowing wisps of smoke from the edges of the hot spring and incandescent lamps\
  \ along the center to mark the wooden bridge towards the main building in this hour\
  \ of dawn added to the surreal atmosphere of the place. In spite of the roaring\
  \ sound of water, the place was so tranquil and exuded such peaceful vibes! Soon\
  \ I heard some of my friends getting up, jolting me out of my reverie. We were all\
  \ ready for the morning prayers within the hour.\n\nThe main complex was magnificent\
  \ with ample seating space for around five hundred people at one time. Prayers continued\
  \ throughout the day with bhajan, kirtan (religious music) and path (religious reading\
  \ from the Holy Scripture). \n\n\u201CPaayo ji maine raam rattan dhan paayo\u2026\
  .\u201D\n\nHere again, I noted the amalgam of two religions with the unique and\
  \ soothing combination of bhajan notes and paath at the same time. After an hour\
  \ of religious ceremonies,  proceeded onto the first floor for langar (community\
  \ vegetarian meals in Gurudwaras available for everyone). \n\nThe room-cave was\
  \ hewn out of rock- a panoramic view of the bridge and surrounding mountains greeted\
  \ us as we entered. The walls were covered with paintings and murals depicting the\
  \ ancient lore as per scriptures. As we ate our breakfast, I pondered upon this\
  \ for the thousandth time:\n\n\u2018Why is it that food always tastes so different\
  \ and delicious if it is part of the langar?\u2019 \n\nLangar generally consists\
  \ of a normal vegetarian Indian meal-rice or roti (pita) with dal (lentil), dahi\
  \ (yogurt) and kheer or halwa (milk sweet dishes) followed by water from the sarovar\
  \ (fresh water from pools present in all Gurudwaras believed to have curative properties).\
  \ No doubt, the food was savory in this instance too. \n\nBreakfast finished, we\
  \ decided to explore the area further. Up here, the hours pass quickly. We had toured\
  \ the hot cave, the sacred Shiv Mandir Complex and local shops within what felt\
  \ like an hour. Handicrafts and vibrant colors of Himachal peeked at us from every\
  \ nook and cranny-it was really difficult to decide gifts for everyone! Laden with\
  \ packages, we walked back to our temporary accommodations to gather all our possessions.\n\
  \nIt was the time to go,  \n\nbut \u2026.\n\nno one wanted to leave. \n\nAs we rounded\
  \ the bend walking towards our buses, I turned back for one last glimpse and realized\
  \ I had tears in my eyes. Perhaps it was the serenity in the atmosphere or the tranquility\
  \ of nature that moved me, who knows? All I know is that standing there as a mute\
  \ witness to the breathtaking beauty of nature, I didn't expect to find a profound\
  \ lesson in a simple excursion!"
