Text: "A shutter snaps as we browse the shelves for jasmine tea. We turn to find the\
  \ source: a young man in the produce aisle has his cell phone aimed at us. From\
  \ what we\u2019ve gathered in the past few days, foreigners are a rare sight in\
  \ Shenzhen, while signs of the Chinese government\u2019s watchful eye are anything\
  \ but\u2014a combination that has me, a Los Angeles native, feeling like a fish\
  \ in a fishbowl. \n\nWhen I arrived, a dense canopy of large, intrusive surveillance\
  \ cameras greeted me at the airport and a slew of automated fingerprinting machines\
  \ repeatedly rejected my prints until I broke into a nervous sweat. The streets\
  \ are no different. Even in the sleepy suburb of Pingshan, an hour drive from downtown\
  \ Shenzhen, the ever-present lens is constantly keeping tabs. Late at night, when\
  \ I\u2019m delirious with jet lag-induced insomnia, I lie in the hotel bed and wonder\
  \ if the TV is watching me. \n\nWhat\u2019s an L.A. girl doing in the suburbs of\
  \ a communist country half a world away? I\u2019m spending the holidays with my\
  \ fianc\xE9, Axel, who was hired by a Chinese company and immediately sent here,\
  \ to headquarters, for a two-month training.\n\nBefore his departure, we met with\
  \ one of his L.A.-based colleagues for a rundown of what to expect. First, he reminded\
  \ us that there is no free speech in China, which made me think, \u201CMy big American\
  \ mouth is definitely going to get me arrested.\u201D Second, there is no free internet,\
  \ so handy travel apps, like Yelp, Uber and Google maps are blocked. Facebook, Instagram\
  \ and Twitter: blocked. YouTube and Netflix: you get the gist. The Chinese have\
  \ applications of their own, but many\u2014like the popular rideshare app DiDi and\
  \ the ubiquitous messaging and payment app WeChat\u2014require Chinese banks accounts\
  \ to function. \n\nWe\u2019ve learned firsthand that technological issues plus a\
  \ language barrier make mountains out of mole hills. Because most locals don\u2019\
  t speak English and we don\u2019t speak Mandarin, Axel and I have been scraping\
  \ by with our fickle translation app, often leaving puzzled looks and blank stares\
  \ in our wake. Without it, we are like large toddlers, unable to understand or be\
  \ understood. When all else fails, we answer each other\u2019s questions with questions:\
  \ \n\n\u201CWhy is the cabbie yelling at us?\u201D \n\n\u201CIs he making the hang-loose\
  \ gesture?\u201D\n\n\u201CDidn\u2019t we tip him enough?\u201D \n\nWe rely on Axel\u2019\
  s colleagues, who hail our rides and translate everything from menus to train schedules.\
  \ In simple sentences, we bridge the cultural divide. We explain our dismay when\
  \ brightly packaged candy turns out to be dried fish. They ask us about Kobe Bryant.\n\
  \nOn Christmas Eve, Axel and I exchange gifts before joining the group for dinner\
  \ at a local hole-in-the-wall. I watch their chopsticks as they maneuver stewed\
  \ meat and stir-fried vegetables with the effortless grace of ballerinas on pointe,\
  \ as I drop bok choy into my bowl of broth, splashing my dress with grease. When\
  \ I finally get rice into my mouth, I chew slowly to delay my next move. I wonder\
  \ what my family is doing across the ocean and imagine the familiar smell of my\
  \ grandmother\u2019s Armenian cooking. When I finally swallow, I swallow the urge\
  \ to cry.     \n\nOn Christmas morning, Axel takes the day off work and we spend\
  \ the day exploring Downtown Shenzhen. By sundown, people are swarming the Civic\
  \ Center\u2014the glimmering centerpiece of a young city, and the perfect place\
  \ to view the nightly light show. \n\nAs we stand here cloaked in darkness and enveloped\
  \ by buildings that scrape the sky, no one stares or even notices us. Feeling blissfully\
  \ anonymous, I buy a pair of LED cat ears from a street vendor and put them on.\
  \ The clock strikes 7 and, as music erupts from all around, the surfaces of Shenzhen\u2019\
  s high-rises burst into choreographed dance. They\u2019re blanketed with lights\
  \ that conjure sailboats, fireworks and waves of color that swell from one building\
  \ to the next. I steal a glance at the thousands of smiling faces and meet the gaze\
  \ of a little girl in pigtails, the same pair of cat ears flashing on her head.\n\
  \nFor the first time in days, I feel like I belong."
