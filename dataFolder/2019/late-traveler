Text: "Hi, my name is Jewels, and I\u2019m a travelholic. I was born and raised in\
  \ New York and always loved the idea of traveling but had a strong fear of flying.\
  \ The longest flight I had taken, previous to my recent travels, was the annual\
  \  2 1/2 hour trip to Disney World. Not to mention, I didn\u2019t get the opportunity\
  \ to travel on my own until my 30th bday and once I was bitten by the \u201Ctravel\
  \ bug\u201D the wanderlust took over.\n\nI embarked on my first solo trip in 2016,\
  \ when I traveled to Hawaii  to celebrate my 30th birthday. At first, I was extremely\
  \ nervous because this was a 10 hour flight and the farthest I\u2019ve ever  been\
  \ from home. But once I landed, my whole world changed. Hawaii was the first time\
  \ I experienced the magic that happens when you step out of your comfort zone. My\
  \ time there became the catalyst for my travel lifestyle and identity.\n\nSince\
  \ 2016, I\u2019ve traveled to over 20 different locations where I\u2019ve gone after\
  \ new and authentic experiences.\n\nMy blog is to show the ambivalent traveler what\
  \ and how to become a world explorer. There is so much of this world that is beautiful\
  \ , and needs to be seen in person. The more I see, the more I want to discover."
