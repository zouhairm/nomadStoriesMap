Text: "Gilbert pointed at random objects and named them in Swahili. \"Mshanga,\" he\
  \ said, and pointed at an acacia; \"Jani,\" he stated as he touched its leaf. I\
  \ pointed my finger at a colorful blue-breasted starling and he responded \"Nyota.\"\
  \ After a short silence, he went on to speak to me in an almost perfect English.\n\
  \n-   \tIn this area we call it \"Makweo\", although in Swahili it is called \"\
  Nyota\". - And he would stay calm, as if I were to memorize all those words.\n\n\
  Gilbert was as tall as a professional basketball player and his long arms hung gracefully\
  \ on either side of the body.  He kept his full lips tight as he drove through the\
  \ streets of that chaotic and ramshackle city. His job was to take me from one place\
  \ to another because, apparently, it wasn't safe for a young woman to travel alone\
  \ in the country. The first few days he stayed quiet and aloof, and I dared not\
  \ bring down that wall for fear of being disrespectful in his culture. I felt awkward\
  \ walking through those streets, visiting and interviewing all those strangers who\
  \ often looked at me with distrust. I was afraid they would notice that I was no\
  \ experienced traveler, as if that was something you could see by looking someone\
  \ in the eye. After the first week, Gilbert and I became good friends. He never\
  \ smiled and yet was extremely kind.\n\nOne afternoon we walked along a dusty trail\
  \ when I saw a huge tree that stood on the red earth by the road. I stopped walking\
  \ and pointed at the tree, resuming our private game. \"Baobab,\" said Gilbert,\
  \ knowing that I would instantly recognize that word.\n\n-   \tHow old is it? -I\
  \ asked. \n-   \tI don't know. Maybe six hundred, or a thousand years. Some live\
  \ up to five thousand.\n\nI held my breath before that miracle of nature and slowly\
  \ approached it. I rested my hands on the thick, smooth crust of that perhaps millenary\
  \ tree, dropped my head on the trunk, rested my cheek and kept my eyes closed. Little\
  \ by little, my arms enclosed the huge body of wood to where they could no longer\
  \ extend. Gilbert looked at me impassive from the road, with his hanging arms and\
  \ his earnest face, waiting respectfully for me to finish my ritual. I slowly walked\
  \ away from the tree and asked him to stand next to him. That tree was about twenty\
  \ meters high and next to it, Gilbert seemed tiny.\n\n-   \tHow old are you? -I\
  \ asked him.\n-   \tTwenty-seven. - He said earnestly.\n-   \tMe too -, I smiled.\n\
  \nI placed the camera in front of my eyes. Gilbert posed as if he didn\u2019t. His\
  \ gesture was no different from when he drove, or walked, or ate. The fact that\
  \ a camera was capturing his existence did not disturb him at all.\n \nAfter two\
  \ weeks in Nairobi, I started my route through the rest of the Kenyan villages.\
  \ They were remote places far away from each other. Along the way, we saw lonely\
  \ people wandering without knowing how long they had been walking, nor how far they\
  \ had to go. We used to camp on dry and smooth terrains, near schools or houses,\
  \ to make sure there would be no dangers in the environment, such as poisonous snakes\
  \ or wild animals, although complete safety was never guaranteed. \n \n-   \tTonight\
  \ is the longest night of the year - He told me one night staring at the bonfire.\
  \ \n\nIt was the 22nd of June. \n\n- It\u2019s the summer solstice. For me, it is\
  \ usually the shortest night of the year. \n- Then it will seem even longer. \n\n\
  My feet almost burned so close to the fire, but in the upper part of my body I was\
  \ cold. Gilbert took off his blue sweatshirt and offered it to me as in some classic\
  \ movie. It smelled like smoke.\n\nAfter several minutes, he stared at me seriously.\
  \ He lifted his finger and pointed my chest with determination.\n\n-   \tWangera.\n\
  \nI pointed at myself and asked curious:\n\n-   \t\xBFWangera? \xBFWhat does it\
  \ mean?\n-   \tTraveller."
