Text: "A whiff of voices and noises escaped from an eerie part of el barrio. Ana whizzed\
  \ far away from her tipples and gawked a murales along the wall; she has been never\
  \ giddy as in that moment. \n\nHundreds of nasty thoughts sealed by a recurring\
  \ dream:  she was walking alone when suddenly someone wrenched her from behind.\
  \ The beginning of her ordeal, unexpected, more terrible than fast. The ground was\
  \ squelchy: the dust shocked the flowing brunette locks, the pockmarked trousers\
  \ betrayed the brutal existence of some prowler, and Ana was lying down like a drawed\
  \ sword.\n\nShe was used to booze, since her father passed away; Ana just reminded\
  \ when he arrived at home after an hard work day bringing a pastel de nata; Carlos\
  \ loved her so much, their steadfast relationship had never been challenged.\n\n\
  The old Port, so frantic and chaotic. Carlos was lurking on a fishermen\u2019s boat,\
  \ carrying barrels, gaffes and baits: on the quays, a zany droning of workers, brackish\
  \ water and fishing nets. The trip looked out dangerous and grueling, he desired\
  \ to come back from his daughter, have a meal together. The sea\u2019s waves swayed\
  \ his soul over; he was on an old-school ship, rather small with an antiquate claw-footed\
  \ look with glorious bows looked bearded. \nTo pitch a harpoon down a live whale\u2019\
  s throat: Carlos suddenly tucked away his breakfast pondering on each single word\
  \ of the Melville\u2019s sentence.\n\nHe was into fantastic sea stories and found\
  \ odd working in the same places described in its quickly devoured books. While\
  \ the flaky fish ended up in his mouth, a silvery haddock surrounded by potatoes\
  \ and oil, he accused a painful swelling, collapsing miserably on the keel.\n\n\
  Ana considered her roots losting in the mists of times; she wanted to be emancipated\
  \ since her period on the college and her rebel mood drived the young girl screwing\
  \ the pooch. She remembered the first trysts, half-smoked cigarettes and an insane\
  \ devotion to walk around sneaking out in the ruas for a concert, a meeting or with\
  \ some boy, with the unescapable smooch looking some freak movie. \n\nHer scratchy\
  \ attitude turned out once in a suburban cinema: she was with Filipe, a Mozambican\
  \ boy. They were smoking weed on the sly, pretty sure that they don\u2019t be discovered\
  \ during the screening, but the sour smell together with their laughing wildly attracted\
  \ the ticket man. Caught in the act, the couple firstly tried to escape but the\
  \ door was locked.\n\nAna thought to her father\u2019s reaction, discovering the\
  \ secret: deeply ashamed, she discouraged Filipe to react unwisely. Known as an\
  \ hot-head, the muscled guy gave a sharp blow to the controller\u2019s face; later,\
  \ the bleeding man called the police and the night the two passed wasn\u2019t exactly\
  \ the most memorable.\n\nCarlos came really late, around 2 of the night: his daughter\
  \ sobbed saying senseless words. He frowned his eyebrows, looking at her with a\
  \ double feeling of deprecation and fatherly sympathy.\n\n-You would have done better\
  \ smoking outside- he smoothly whispered; she realized the forgiveness was conceded,\
  \ simply peering the gaze\u2019s melancholy, a sudden saudade of any wickedness.\
  \ The teenage girl hugged her father, in a surreal silence.\n\n\nThe vessel cutted\
  \ silently through lukewarm seawater; Carlos could not consciously desire the identical\
  \ cuddle of years ago because he was apparently lifeless. If he could remain at\
  \ home with Ana he would have brought her with him to the market or wherever she\
  \ wanted. Then, a seagull roosted on the mainmast; the boat was adrift."
