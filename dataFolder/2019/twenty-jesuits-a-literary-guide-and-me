Text: "I was standing there in Newton, Massachusetts\u2019 bus station. My feet were\
  \ wet,and my favorite umbrella had broken under the pressure of Manhattan\u2019\
  s wind. My courage, like my umbrella was crumbling.\n\nThe only thing I could do\
  \ to make the situation less painful, was to sit on a wooden bench, and hoped I\
  \ wasn\u2019t lost,  again. Yet Rick was to blame, this trip had been all his idea.\
  \ I wanted to go to NY and see the JLCO, and he suggested I should go to Boston\
  \ so I could visit him. My best friend from high school and a jesuit in the making,\
  \  was nowhere to be seen. Just to ease my nerves I took out my Literary Guide to\
  \ Boston. I imagined walking down the streets of Boston, following the steps of\
  \  Henry James or Nathaniel Hawthorne. \n\nA green car arrived. It was Rick I almost\
  \ laughed out of relief. \n\n\u201CAre you hungry?\u201D He asked, and I nodded.\u201C\
  Let\u2019s have dinner, and then we\u2019ll get home so I can introduce you to the\
  \ community.\u201D I took a deep breath, meeting people, I hadn\u2019t thought about\
  \ it. In my head, it was going to be me, Rick and my Literary Guide. \u201CAnd sorry,\
  \ we have a problem.\u201D  I raised my eyebrow. He kept talking, as a kid who knows\
  \ is going to be grounded.\u201CWe have two parties. You don\u2019t mind, right?\u201D\
  \n\nStrangely enough I didn\u2019t mind, I only wished I hadn\u2019t bought my Literary\
  \ Guide. \n\nRick had sent me pictures of his home, of course photos never do justice\
  \ to the places. It was cozy, too far from the Monastery in The name of the Rose.\
  \ Also Rick had told me, many of his friends had friends or family staying with\
  \ them. So I thought I was going to be the one of many guests, I wasn\u2019t. As\
  \ Rick introduced me to the rest of the priests, I realized I was the only woman\
  \ under that roof. I didn\u2019t have time to wonder if that was weird or not. One\
  \ of them said:\n\n\u201CSo you are Rick\u2019s friend, the writer?\u201D\n\nI think\
  \ I had never been called a writer before, I had been until the week before a Literature\
  \ teacher in a High School. After that, the rest of the group gave me sorts of advices.\
  \ Colin gave me a ticket for the MFA.  James convinced me to visit the Isabella\
  \ Stewart Gardner to see an exhibition on Fra Angelico. Soon I realized they were\
  \ far more interesting and endearing than any sight. \n\nNext day, when they asked\
  \ me about my day, I told them I had gotten in the museum for free because my name.\
  \ So after that, Cesar suggested, they called Isabella.\n\nBy the third day, I had\
  \ established my routine, I woke up, got ready, and waited for Rick who had gone\
  \ to the gym with James. I\u2019ll sat in the kitchen and chat with whoever was\
  \ having breakfast.\n\nOf course, there was a question burning in side of me. So\
  \ that morning,  I asked Colin, James,  Arnav how do they decided they wanted to\
  \ be jesuits or priests? They had never talked about it among themselves. Later,\
  \ James decided it was my own turn to answer: How did you knew you wanted to be\
  \ a writer? At the end of it all, Colin told me: \u201CYou had made breakfast far\
  \ more interesting.\u201D\n\n\nWhen the time came to leave, I didn\u2019t want to.\
  \ Cesar, told me to visit him in Uruguay, Colin thanked me the company during breakfast,\
  \ and James gave me books. After saying goodbye to Rick at bus station, I sat on\
  \ a bench. I opened my backpack, the Literary guide remained untouched."
