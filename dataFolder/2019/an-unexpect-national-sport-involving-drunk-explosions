Text: "When I travel, I feel the need to communicate with locals. Probably, my best\
  \ traveling histories starts with someone who knows the place taking me there, or\
  \ it gets better once I make a friendship. I truly feel it\u2019s the best way to\
  \ dive deeper into an unknown culture. Looking online, asking for traveler\u2019\
  s advices, reading news or researching the place\u2019s history might help, but\
  \ it\u2019s the human connection that brings us the brightest gems.\n\nI was in\
  \ Bogot\xE1, Colombia, wading through La Candelaria, a well located neighbor near\
  \ downtown, bars, cultural institutions, parks and has fine (and cheap) hostels.\
  \ We can se a lot of police officers in their bright green vests wandering through\
  \ streets, so also feels safe. During my walk I found an independent art gallery.\
  \ It had grey walls and unfinished pilasters. Looked cool as other contemporary\
  \ galleries that bet on a rustic look. I walked around, saw one installations with\
  \ few televisions turned on in different channels and a disturbing sound, I also\
  \ tried to dive in some abstract paintings and failed on it. At the end of tour,\
  \ I saw a woman standing on reception and shared perceptions with her. She was the\
  \ curator, and was interested on what I had to say. We kept talking and she invited\
  \ to come back later for a movie exhibition. \nI get back to the strange independent\
  \ Chilean film about a man who stalks a woman. It was interesting to pay attention\
  \ on the Chilean accent and compare to what I heard in Colombia. After the exhibition,\
  \ I went to talk with the curator about how these accent things and she said some\
  \ phrases that synthetize the comparisons, we laugh. She asked if I had already\
  \ met the neighbor where most art galleries are located. I answered that I had no\
  \ idea, so she invited me to go with her and some friends to an opening on next\
  \ day. We would meet tomorrow afternoon and, before going, if I wanted, we could\
  \ make a stop to play Tejo. \n\u201CWhat is that?\u201D\n\u201CI show you tomorrow.\u201D\
  \nTejo is the only national sport of Colombia, which I had no idea that existed\
  \ \u2013 and later on I asked to a few friends who went to the country and other\
  \ foreigners living in the hostel and none knew about it. It\u2019s a mixture of\
  \ boccia/boules, but with a single target, with explosions and lots of alcohol.\
  \ I understood, once we started playing, why she didn\u2019t try to explain me.\
  \ I enter the place and heard \u201Cbangs\u201D and screams of celebration. First,\
  \ to play, we need to buy at least 15 bottles of beer. That\u2019s the \u201Centry\
  \ fee\u201D. The game consists in a clay plate, at a 45-degree angle, with four\
  \ paper triangles full of gunpowder arranged on the midle. The player has a heavy\
  \ metal disc and has to throw it at the target. If the disc reaches the middle,\
  \ between the triangles, the player gets the highest score. If it reaches a triangle.\
  \ BOOM! So you can guess where most people aim. There\u2019s an official measure\
  \ to distance oneself for the throwing, but the amateurs play closer to target.\
  \ In the place, we can see a lot of these corridors surrounded by nets to protect\
  \ other players, with the clay target in one end, and a table full of empty bottles\
  \ of beer in other. We played, we drunk and laughed a lot. Once the sun sets down,\
  \ people gets crazier and \u201Caccidents happens\u201D, they told me after I saw\
  \ a man bleeding on the head and putting ice on it. I got in second place in our\
  \ group of four, but what we really counted as score was the bottles: enough to\
  \ get us a worse performance in the end than when I tried for the first time. A\
  \ trick game which you only get inferior by the time. I was dizzy and we were getting\
  \ a taxi for the second part of our ride, when I realized I discovered something\
  \ new that I would never done because I wasn\u2019t searching for. The proof on\
  \ what was said on beginning of talk."
