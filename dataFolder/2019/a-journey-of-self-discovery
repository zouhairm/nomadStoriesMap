Text: "For the past 3 months I\u2019ve been planning for a super-hot romantic getaway\
  \ with my crush to Bali. We haven\u2019t seen each other for about 5 months since\
  \ we\u2019re 3,396 miles apart. \n\nWhen he said yes, I feel like Kate Winslet on\
  \ top of The Titanic with Leonardo DiCaprio.  So, I started to list down the ideal\
  \ romantic getaway, including a private beach cave dinner. This trip will totally\
  \ blow his mind away. Nothing can possibly gone wrong!\n\nA month later, he ghosted\
  \ me. That was the end of my 2017 new year\u2019s resolution! \n\n-What\u2019s Next?-\n\
  After a thoughtful consideration and a sleepless night, I decided to continue the\
  \ trip. But this time around, I will be Julia Roberts, writing and creating my own\
  \ version of \u201CEat, Pray, Love\u201D journey. So let the adventure Begins!\n\
  \n-Canggu-\nI called one of my best friend and ask her to come along.  We decided\
  \ to stay in Canggu, a new gem for hipsters to stay, chill and explore. Canggu is\
  \ also well \u2013 known for its cafe, either with urban industrial style or wooden\
  \ rustic themed with a picturesque beach background.\n\nThe thing we love the most\
  \ about Canggu is that the area is not crowded like Seminyak and Kuta.  You can\
  \ sit all day long & enjoy the sound of the waves with a bottle of beer until sundown.\
  \  \n\n-The Unplanned Island Adventure - \nDuring our stay, we went a visit to our\
  \ friend\u2019s villa where she had a pool party and invited a tarot reader.   After\
  \ 15 minute heart to heart session with the tarot reader, he asked what our plan\
  \ is for tomorrow. Shockingly, during day time he worked as a show girl in one of\
  \ Bali Island Cruise Ship. Believe or not, he offered us a special cruise discount.\
  \ So with $50, I got my love predictions and get 50% of for Cruising to Nusa Penida.\
  \ What a catch!\n\nThe next morning, we\u2019re off to Nusa Penida. The cruise ship\
  \ was amazing. They had this crazy 44 meter water slide and they gave you unlimited\
  \ access for banana boat, jet sky and even snorkeling. \n\nWe can also explore the\
  \ island with a traditional horse carriage. They will take you to the cliff side\
  \ of Nusa Penida where you enjoy the breath-taking view of the island from above\
  \ while listening the ocean waves crashing.\n\nThe exciting part is while we\u2019\
  re queuing for the slide, we met this 2 strangers from New York! One of them can\
  \ speak Bahasa and she overheard that we\u2019re clueless for year end.  Apparently\
  \ both of them are single and they are actually looking for a crowd! So they introduce\
  \ themselves and invited us to jungle party in Ubud with shower of glitters and\
  \ Maracas! Of course we said yes!  \n\n-The Whimsical Ubud-\nNestled in the mountain\
  \ and heart of natural beauty, I always thought that Ubud is only for lovers. Never\
  \ have I imagined, it is actually a great place for solo travelers or with a group\
  \ of friends. They also offers variety of adventures such as rafting , biking or\
  \ even an open Volkswagen tour around the village to see the culture and the beautiful\
  \ mountain and rice fields.\n\nSince the four of us are single, we decided to go\
  \ to Pura Tirta Empul, a Hindu Balinese water temple that famous for its holy water.\
  \ Since year end is approaching, we thought let us throw all the bad luck away and\
  \ let start fresh for the new year, and  maybe we finally meet Mr. Right ;)\n\n\
  -Self - Contemplating-\nI have been too so many places around the world, but I have\
  \ never traveled solo before. At the end of the trip, I decided to extend one more\
  \ day in Bali. Yes, just me, myself and I. \n\nSo, I went to Sea salt Cafe Seminyak\
  \ & got the best spot. While watching the beautiful sundown, I started to write\
  \ down all of my ups and downs throughout the year. Surprisingly, I have gained\
  \ more blessings! Through this journey I realized that travelling is not only about\
  \ exploring beautiful places, but you can meet new friends, learning something new\
  \ out of your comfort zone and found yourself!"
