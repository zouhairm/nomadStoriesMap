Text: "It was winter when I arrived in Manaus - or at least the closest you will get\
  \ to winter in the humid tropical rainforest climate. To me, there has always been\
  \ something intriguing and mysterious about this part of South America. A mix of\
  \ dreamy landscapes with the danger of the unknown. The exquisite beauty and delicacy\
  \ of nature mixed with the roughness of the skyline made of concrete. The plane\
  \ landed in the middle of the night, leaving me with nothing but the view of the\
  \ twinkly lights of the city surrounded by the dark silhouettes of the Amazon jungle.\n\
  \nThe capital of the largest state in Brazil is filled with unforeseen contrast.\
  \ On my way to the Marina do Davi - where I would take the boat to go deep in the\
  \ forest - I\u2019ve passed through areas with very simple and fragile settlements,\
  \ expensive cars, people begging for some money when the traffic lights would turn\
  \ red, luxurious buildings and also areas of native forest, everything on a simple\
  \ fifteen minute ride. The fresh perfume of the leafy trees would be mixed with\
  \ the smoke from the vehicles on every stage of the journey, even when I\u2019ve\
  \ arrived at the docks, with boats of all shapes and sizes arriving and leaving\
  \ all day.\n\nOn a rainy mid-afternoon, I was sitting on a tiny boat that is used\
  \ as a local transport to reach communities located on the river banks. There were\
  \ passengers carrying scented herbs and spices, colourful and mouthwatering fruits,\
  \ gleeful but shy indigenous children and curious outsiders like me. The bumpy boat\
  \ ride also included us moving from one side to the other to maintain the little\
  \ boat stability, as if we were dancing to an unchoreographed waltz at every stop.\
  \ After a few changes of seats, I finally managed to relax and enjoy the ride. Feeling\
  \ the water drops emerging from the Rio Negro and landing on my face, smelling the\
  \ earthy aroma produced when the thin rain fell on dry soil, listening the splash\
  \ of water and the songs of the birds resting on the branches of hundreds of years\
  \ old trees while the wind entangled my hair was a way of transporting me out of\
  \ the unexpected city buzz. At that point, I did not want the ride to end, I wanted\
  \ to keep absorbing the nature and gazing at the evergreen horizon but my stop was\
  \ close and my guide was already waiting for me.\n\nHer name was Marilene, her voice\
  \ was as sweet as her genuine smile. Her muddy and worn out boots were proof that\
  \ she had wandered through the forest for a long time and knew every inch of it.\
  \ Marilene was in charge of all the guided visits through the woods and the ruins\
  \ of a former rubber factory known as the Seringal - a rudimental factory that had\
  \ its heydays during the Amazon rubber boom. My guide rhythms her stories and tales\
  \ as if she was singing an indigenous song and we make our way through the trees\
  \ as if we were weaving a close-knit textile.\n\nAs we walked through the dense\
  \ jungle, to the sound of the buzzing mosquitoes and the whoop of the jumping monkeys,\
  \ she taught me how to identify species of plants, how to extract latex from the\
  \ tree trunks but most of all she taught me a new way of seeing and understanding\
  \ the environment around us. Given that she is a resident of the nearby community,\
  \ you could feel her respect and admiration for the forest. It was the place she\
  \ was from, the area where she intends to live for the rest of her life and the\
  \ land that she will fight to protect and preserve from dusk till dawn. I did not\
  \ come to the Amazon with a specific goal, but what I truly did not expect to find\
  \ was a change of mindset that I will carry with me throughout the rest of my life.\
  \ As I waved goodbye to Marilene and the rest of the locals from the little boat\
  \ I was in, the light was dimming on the horizon and my heart was filled with joy."
