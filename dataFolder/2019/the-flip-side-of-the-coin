Text: "How many times have we heard that socialism is bad, a disguise for the one\
  \ who pretends to be a tyrant or dictator?.  For those of us who live in countries\
  \ dominated by the \"progess\" wave of capitalism, that is an idea that aims to\
  \ flood our heads.\nWhen I was ready to make my trip to Varadero, Cuba; the final\
  \ goal was simply: enjoy it. A few days of sun and beach in one of the most beautiful\
  \ places in the Caribbean. In my mind, it never crossed the idea of being able to\
  \ face to face with that reality of many Cubans and that the world changes at their\
  \ convenience.\n\nThe advices that I received, were clear: \u201CDo not buy anything\
  \ in the street because it is ilegal\u201D, \u201CDo not believe in women  or men\
  \ in the street for a tour, because they only are seeking to cheat your money\u201D\
  . \nAll of that were wrong ideas, for the fortune of the Cubans!!! (and mine, of\
  \ course). What I really found and received, was for me a slap with a white glove,\
  \ as we said for something that makes you feel without words but with pleasure of\
  \ seeing. \n\nI saw socialism, yes, the real people without wealth, not overflowing\
  \ and uneven as we are used to seeing, at least in my country. I never saw someone\
  \ begging on the streets and living under a bridge or on a bench. I never heard\
  \ of any Cubans not answering a question from an outsider, regardless of nationality:\
  \ French, English, German; its seemed like their mother languages to them. I never\
  \ had to witness, children working on the streets, or elderly people abandoned by\
  \ someone else. Humble? Yes, Unhappy or Disagree ?, No. Talking with people in Havana,\
  \ they never told me to dream of a mansion and a trip to a luxurious beach; They\
  \ had work, roof and food. Nothing else mattered.\n\nAmong people who gave you that\
  \ feeling, the feeling of the air of equality; I could not help return to Mexico\
  \ and feel bad for my country. Recriminate my government for capitalism and look\
  \ around me, inequality really hurts. Because while the world lives believing that\
  \ Cuba suffers, it forgets its streets, where the suffering is big and is real.\
  \ \n\nThat trip gave a better idea of world and how it really works. What really\
  \ matters, and that is the most important part of a trip for me, it has to be significant.\
  \  Maybe I can not change in one step my Country, but now I have the skill to share\
  \ my view and start with a little step."
