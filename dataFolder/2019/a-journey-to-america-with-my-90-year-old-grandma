Text: "On September the 1st, I woke up early because I was about to go on a long-awaited\
  \ journey to California with my mother, my sister, and my 90-year-old grandma. The\
  \ purpose of this endeavor was to fulfill my grandma\u2019s biggest wish \u2013\
  \ to witness the magnificence of the Golden Gate Bridge. This had been a lifelong\
  \ longing, due to her beloved brother who had been captivated by the bridge\u2019\
  s beauty. \nHe served in the army during World War II and when she was just 11 years\
  \ old he brought her a beautiful poster of the Golden Gate Bridge. According to\
  \ her brother, it was the most spectacular piece of architecture - a must-see. He\
  \ hoped she could see it for herself someday. She hoped for the same. Shortly afterward,\
  \ he passed away when the naval ship that was transporting him home from a deployment\
  \ in Canada was destroyed by a missile.\nThe years went by and she never found the\
  \ right time to see what her brother had seen. She often dreamed about the trip,\
  \ however, such a journey from England to America wasn\u2019t as easy then as it\
  \ is now. By the time we learned about her desire, she believed she was too old\
  \ and had lost all hope of seeing it.\nIt was during her 90th birthday celebration\
  \ that my family convinced her that it was time she saw that famous bridge. With\
  \ us as her companions, of course! Although uncertain it would ever happen, her\
  \ doctors gave her the green light and eight months later, the four of us were boarding\
  \ a plane to California.  \nThe following two weeks were unforgettable, not only\
  \ because of the bridge but because of our time together as a family, a rare occurrence\
  \ in modern times. Our adventure began in San Diego where we stumbled across a market\
  \ and wonderful restaurants in the Gaslamp District.  We took a tram to Little Italy,\
  \ from where we walked along the Bay past all the big ships, including a huge naval\
  \ Destroyer, followed by an old sailing ship with sails almost reaching the sky.\
  \ We shopped in Seaport Village, an outdoor arts and crafts center. There was a\
  \ band playing, so my grandma and I had a dance in the middle of the square. It\
  \ was a great time!\nIn the evening we drove over to Coronado Island and had drinks\
  \ in the magnificent mansion Hotel Del Coronado, which was featured in the film\
  \ \u2018Some Like It Hot\u2019. We ended our time in San Diego in Balboa Park, relaxing\
  \ and watching street artists performing their dance moves. \nThe next destination\
  \ of our trip was Los Angeles. Of course, we visited Hollywood and the Griffith\
  \ Observatory, both renowned for their Stars as well as Venice Beach, Long Island,\
  \ Downtown LA and Malibu. Continuing our journey up the coast we stopped off in\
  \ Santa Barbara before spending a night in a log cabin in the Big Sur.  \nThen,\
  \ a week after we had set foot on to US soil, we finally arrived in San Francisco.\
  \ We had planned to visit the Golden Gate Bridge the subsequent day, but I decided,\
  \ that we were early enough to go straight there just before the sunset. We drove\
  \ right through the rush hour of San Francisco, the excitement of finally crossing\
  \ the Golden Gate Bridge growing by the minute. It was beautiful! \nWe drove up\
  \ the hillside where we saw it in all its glory. The sun was shining brilliantly;\
  \ we could see the full length of the bridge. With the blue sea underneath it was\
  \ a perfect place to get the very best view. This was without a doubt the most emotional\
  \ part of the journey as my grandma remembered her beloved brother.  \nThe following\
  \ day I sat her on a chair with the bridge in the background and interviewed her\
  \ about how she felt seeing the bridge after all these years of dreaming about it.\n\
  All I can say is that we had had a lovely trip to California and that I wish to\
  \ be like my grandma when I\u2019m 90 years old \u2013 still rocking and traveling\
  \ around the world!"
