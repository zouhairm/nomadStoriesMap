Text: "If you\u2019re looking from a distance, in the hours before sunrise you will\
  \ see the fireflies of Bali\u2019s Mount Batur appear on the mountainside. Bobbing\
  \ and floating in clusters, they ascend its steep, rocky slopes, gradually making\
  \ their way to the peak. It\u2019s truly a magical sight - until the darkness lifts,\
  \ and you realize that they are not in fact fireflies but the headlamps of hundreds\
  \ of hikers making their pilgrimage to see the sun rise over Lombok\u2019s Mount\
  \ Rinjani. I had heard it was one of the most beautiful sights in Bali, a \u2018\
  don\u2019t miss it\u2019 experience. Despite my fear of heights, I was going to\
  \ channel my inner mountain goat and hike over five thousand feet in the dark. Today,\
  \ I would become one of those fireflies.\n\n\nI had already spent most of the night\
  \ envisioning all the ways I might fall to my death on Mount Batur when the alarm\
  \ on my phone pierced the night\u2019s silence at 2:30 AM. Despite the early hour,\
  \ my roommate Julie was in high spirits. Both solo travellers, we had met and bonded\
  \ in Ubud over our shared Canadian heritage and mutual aversion to snow. What better\
  \ way to avoid the cold North American winter than to work up a sweat hiking two\
  \ and a half hours up a mountain in the dead of night?\n\n\nJulie and I met our\
  \ tour guide at the base; a small, spritely teen named Nyoman who proudly announced\
  \ he made the five and a half hour trek up and down the mountain every single day.\
  \ He shook my hand while juggling his hiking gear in the other arm, which turned\
  \ out to be a bottle of water and a packet of Oreos. On his feet he donned a pair\
  \ of thong sandals.\n\n\n\u201CThey are my hiking sandals,\u201D he explained.\n\
  \n \nI looked down at my own outfit; brand new running shoes, a headlamp, and enough\
  \ snacks to feed a small army. Surely the mountain was full of sprain-inducing dangers\
  \ that no \u2018hiking sandal\u2019 could overcome? But as we began our climb I\
  \ realized the difference between Nyoman\u2019s hiking skills and my own; plainly,\
  \ he had some and I had none. Nyoman leapt between the cracks and crevices of the\
  \ mountainside with superhuman agility, thong sandals and headlamp be damned. He\
  \ moved as if he was a part of the mountain itself. As we hiked in near blindness,\
  \ the mountain came alive with sound; the crunch of gravel underneath my feet, the\
  \ rustling of tall grasses in the breeze, and the buzzing song of crickets surrounded\
  \ us. The rocks were slippery with dew, and despite my shoes I took my share of\
  \ tumbles in the dark. I was sure Nyoman must be getting a kick out of the hikers\
  \ in their fancy footwear stumbling up the mountain while he practically flew up\
  \ it like a bat in the dark.\n\n \nA few scraped knees later we arrived at the top,\
  \ just as the sun was cresting over Mount Rinjani. The sky was already awash in\
  \ grey, blue, and orange, and for the first time I could finally see the mountain\
  \ itself. It was lush, green, and much steeper than I had imagined. We had climbed\
  \ so high we were above the cloud line, and through the clouds the crystal clear\
  \ waters of Lake Batur shimmered below us. Troupes of monkeys had also shown up\
  \ to the party; mothers with babies hanging from their bellies, cheeky young ones\
  \ playing tag, and plump patriarchs reclining on the dirt.\n\n \nExhausted, a little\
  \ bloody, and exuberant, Julie and I sat in the morning mist and watched the sunrise\
  \ with cups of hot ginger tea and sandwiches in our hands. I realized that hiking\
  \ the mountain in the dark had actually been a blessing in disguise. Sometimes,\
  \ stumbling blindly into the unknown results in the most worthwhile experiences\
  \ of all.\n\n\nI thought that the moment couldn\u2019t get any better until a monkey,\
  \ one of the cheeky ones, sidled up to me and swiped the sandwich right out of my\
  \ hand.\n\n\n\u2018Godspeed, little dude,\u2019 I said.\n\n\nHis little belly and\
  \ my heart would be full for the rest of the day."
