Text: "If you were to get a map of southern Spain and draw an \u201CX\u201D on it\
  \ with Granada at the center, the village of Prado Negro would be found nearly 30km\
  \ northeast of Granada along the intersecting line. Along the same line, at the\
  \ same distance from Granada, but in the opposite direction, you would find the\
  \ famous Puerto del Suspiro del Moro (Pass of the Moor\u2019s Sigh). Here, Spain\u2019\
  s last Moorish king Boabdil paused on his way to exile to take one final, wistful\
  \ look at Granada\u2019s hilltop Alhambra palace in the distance: the seat of his\
  \ former kingdom, which now belonged to the Catholic Monarchs. \n\n\tYou may not\
  \ think that Prado Negro, a village with an eight-sentence description on Wikipedia,\
  \ and a population of 40, ought to keep company with the likes of historic giants\
  \ such as Granada and the Puerto del Suspiro del Moro. You may think, as I did before\
  \ visiting, that it should step aside and let a brighter star take its place in\
  \ the Orion\u2019s belt line that you can draw on a map from the site where an 800\
  \ year struggle over Spain between Moors and Christians ended, to the former Nasrid\
  \ Dynasty capital, to this unassuming village. After all, if Prado Negro were to\
  \ sit down to dinner with Granada and the Puerto del Suspiro del Moro, what could\
  \ it possibly contribute to the conversation about Spain\u2019s history other than\
  \ the blowing of its wind and bleating of its sheep? \n\n\tI had actually ended\
  \ up there in March of 2015 simply because I didn\u2019t want to be somewhere else,\
  \ which is an admittedly inauspicious start to an adventure. I was escaping Granada,\
  \ which was throbbing with tourists from around the world, who had poured in for\
  \ the Semana Santa Easter week processions. Though I was also a foreigner, I felt\
  \ a righteous indignation at these tourists, who were eating all of Granada\u2019\
  s meals, populating all its windy streets, and occupying all its available Airbnbs.\
  \ A rentable tree house constructed by a French carpenter, and the promise of fresh\
  \ eggs for breakfast drew me away to Prado Negro for the week, where the carpenter\
  \ Sylvain and his wife Rosa welcomed me to their property. \n\n\tWhat I found in\
  \ Prado Negro was not the flashiness of Easter festivities, but the enterprising\
  \ spirit of the inhabitants of a resource-constrained rural village, and a more\
  \ honest picture of what life was truly like in the region with the highest unemployment\
  \ rate of the entire EU in 2014, the year before my visit. Whereas Granada and the\
  \ Puerto del Suspiro del Moro intrigued me with their fanciful legends from the\
  \ past, Prado Negro awakened me to the very real, and very current, \u201Ccrisis\u201D\
  \ (which I still hear in my head with the Spanish pronunciation \u201Ccree-sees\u201D\
  ) that everybody in Spain was talking about.\n\n\tThe wind itself seemed to whisper\
  \ about it. Piles of trash and discarded home goods lined the main dirt road, and\
  \ stray dogs sniffed their way through for food scraps, or hunted rodents in the\
  \ fields. This wasn\u2019t the Spain from the feria posters sold to tourists in\
  \ Seville\u2019s streets. Sylvain told me that residents of surrounding cities who\
  \ couldn\u2019t, or didn\u2019t want to, pay for trash removal or pet upkeep abandoned\
  \ them in small villages like Prado Negro. He had built four tree houses predominantly\
  \ using materials from that dump, but like the other villagers, couldn\u2019t afford\
  \ to feed any animal that couldn\u2019t earn its keep. So the abandoned dogs remained\
  \ strays. \n\n\tThe night before I left, Rosa and I sat in a sauna that she had\
  \ built out of a giant copper alembic found on the property, which was formerly\
  \ used for distilling lavender essential oil. The region used to be known for this.\
  \ The alembic was outfitted with two wooden stumps for stools, and was just large\
  \ enough to fit two crouching adults: one on either side of a coal-heated, water-filled\
  \ saucepan. I sat across Rosa with a growing respect for her and Sylvain\u2019s\
  \ resilience and resourcefulness during trying times, and an understanding that\
  \ Spain had more faces to show me than the jovial one it put on during fiestas and\
  \ ferias."
