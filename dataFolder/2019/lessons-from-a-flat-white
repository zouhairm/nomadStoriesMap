Text: "For some odd reason, walking into a coffee shop, stating, \u201Cthe regular,\u201D\
  \ and having someone know what I was talking about, had always been a dream of mine.\
  \ I went from city to city, cozying up to baristas but was never given more than\
  \ an irritated \u201Cno\u201D when, while placing my order, I insisted, \u201CYou\
  \ know what I want. It\u2019s what I always get.\u201D I was so disheartened that\
  \ neither I nor my coffee order was memorable, that, when I moved to Gisenyi, Rwanda,\
  \ I had all but forgotten about my dream.   \nGisenyi is a coffee lover\u2019s dream\
  \ in theory. Located in Northwestern Rwanda, it\u2019s an abnormally tranquil border\
  \ town whose coffee-and-banana-tree-covered hills slope downward toward an equally\
  \ calm Lake Kivu. The temperate climate, high elevation and adequate rainfall keep\
  \ the hills waving with dark-green leaves and red plump coffee beans year round.\
  \ Yet with all that coffee around, Nescafe still dominates the bodega shelves, and,\
  \ in homes, tea is the beverage of choice. A nice morning stroll on Kivu\u2019s\
  \ rocky banks often proved quite frustrating, then, when a caffeine headache kicked\
  \ in, coffee was in sight, but all that was waiting at home was a watery cup of\
  \ instant. Two months after arriving in Gisenyi, however, two American women solved\
  \ my problem by opening Calafia. \nPerched on top of a small hill overlooking the\
  \ lake, Calafia was a gem for anyone who could survive the steep \u201Csteps\u201D\
  \ that led to its entrance. Their menu included roasted eggplant, tahini, and goat\
  \ cheese sandwiches, a delicious escape from the ubiquitous beans and potato imvange\
  \ that had already made its way into my diet. Iridescent birds with long tail feathers\
  \ filtered in and out of frangipani flowers whose fragrance greeted you as you struggled\
  \ up the steps, yet best of all was the Rwandan coffee that they used to make nutty\
  \ lattes and cappuccinos. Those beans, now roasted, had finally found their way\
  \ back home. \nAlthough I didn\u2019t go to there but once a week, Calafia ended\
  \ up being more than just a coffee shop to me. The first of its kind in Gisenyi,\
  \ this \u201CCalifornia style\u201D caf\xE9 provided me a much needed outlet from\
  \ the challenges of ex-pat life. Rwanda wasn\u2019t proving the easiest of places\
  \ to make friends and life was lonely. In addition, I worked at a Rwandan university\
  \ and was being pressured to accept more teaching hours than my contract stipulated.\
  \ My denial to work more than what I was contracted for wasn\u2019t going over well.\
  \ Calafia, with its espresso machine, chocolate chip cookies, and brownies was a\
  \ small part of home when I needed it most. \nPerhaps this longing for home coupled\
  \ with an overzealous mission to make friends left an impression on the barista,\
  \ Lambert, because one afternoon I stepped into the high-ceilinged room where the\
  \ counter was and experienced the most tickling of greetings.\n\u201CHi, Lambert,\u201D\
  \ I said.\n\u201CGood afternoon, Jessica. Would you like a flat white like always?\u201D\
  \nI think I must have spent one full minute smiling before I said \u201Cof course\u201D\
  \ and proceeded to find a seat by the window. My silence wasn\u2019t caused by finally\
  \ having my dream come true, however. Instead, in that minute, I understood through\
  \ an inconsequential cup of coffee that sometimes you find what you\u2019ve always\
  \ been looking for where you never even thought to look."
