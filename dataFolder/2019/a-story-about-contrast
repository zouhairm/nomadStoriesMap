Text: "My first time in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was more than an adventure: it was\
  \ an awakening. I was conducting a project about restorative justice as a mechanism\
  \ of criminal liability, so I was called by the State Court to implement my work\
  \ at a Carioca community. I arrived at Rio by 2pm, and a cab took me to the most\
  \ sarcastic place I\u2019ve ever been to.\nAstonishing and ironic, the landscape\
  \ was breathtaking: one side showed me a majestic sea, surrounded by great mountains,\
  \ it was the view of absolute abundance; the other side, literally across the street,\
  \ also showed me a sea, but a sea of people, coming and going, with apparently no\
  \ directions to follow. Those mountains were covered by tiny and precarious houses,\
  \ it was the view of poverty. \nOnce I arrived at Paco\u2019s home \u2013 the first\
  \ criminal I thought I was going to save \u2013 I clapped my hands and there he\
  \ was: a black, thin and humble man, smiling at me, giving me good afternoon with\
  \ all of the Brazilian Kindness we are used to hear about. He had a wife, Layla,\
  \ a black woman, also kind, also thin, also humble. They were both very young. They\u2019\
  re little TV was showing news about the new president, Jair Bolsonaro, and his involvement\
  \ with some military mafia.\nI asked Paco what brought him to this project. He said\
  \ he had stolen a bag of breads, three months before my visit to his home, he had\
  \ to feed his wife, who was pregnant, and by the time I went there, had already\
  \ lost the baby, because of undernutrition. He cried. I looked around and saw they\
  \ didn\u2019t have any furniture besides the kitchen, where Layla was working the\
  \ whole time, making little candies, which Paco would sell later.\nBefore I start\
  \ my presentation about Restorative Justice, the chaotic scenario of poverty turned\
  \ into a stage to the real chaos: Layla started to convulse, she trembled, cold,\
  \ and her opened eyes denounced absolute fear.\nPaco ran into the kitchen to look\
  \ for her medicines, but she had used all of them. \u201CI have to go to the pharmacy\u201D\
  , he said, and I suggested to call for an ambulance. I think he didn\u2019t laughed\
  \ at me only because he was so terrified.  Of course, a community that doesn\u2019\
  t have education, sanitation and food, probably doesn\u2019t have health resources.\
  \ \nPaco ran, I waited. He left us with some cash in his hands and I just heard\
  \ the shots once he got out of the community. He died even before his wife, who\
  \ he was trying to save. Two cops shot him, not because he was a man, running desperate,\
  \ with some cash and cheap clothes, but because he was a black man doing all of\
  \ that. \nBrazilian landscapes are beautiful, if you look the right way. But even\
  \ if you choose to admire all directions, you can see what Brazil is all about:\
  \ contrast. Of races, of sceneries, of cultures. That could be a beautiful picture\u2026\
  \ If it wasn\u2019t covered in blood."
