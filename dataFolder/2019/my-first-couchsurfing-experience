Text: "I had my first Couchsurfing experience in Uzbekistan. It was a bit scary initially\
  \ but ultimately truly rewarding. I reached my host\u2019s city at night via train.\
  \ He guided the taxi driver to reach a neutral place. The driver got confused and\
  \ took me to some remote location and I called my host again to sort out the issue.\
  \ I was perplexed since nor did the driver or the host can understand English which\
  \ led to my imaginations run wild! After a couple more phone calls, we finally reached\
  \ the designated place as guided by my host. He graciously received me and seems\
  \ quite happy with the fact that I will be his first guest from India. We met at\
  \ a square and walked on to his place. We were communicating via actions and expressions.\
  \ On the way, we were joined by his friends who were in high spirits. One person\
  \ from the group knew little English who served as a translator between us. A drunk\
  \ translator! The path to my host\u2019s place was poorly lit and even pitch-dark\
  \ at some places. After walking for a few minutes, we reached a big door. It was\
  \ dark outside. My host shushed everyone and slowly we entered the place thanks\
  \ to our mobiles\u2019 flashlight. In my head, I was having all sorts of thoughts.\
  \ Whose place is this? If this is his place, why are we entering like a thief? What\
  \ I got myself into? What excuse should I give to leave? Is there a hostel nearby?\
  \ Upon entering, I scanned the place and it felt like I come to my relative\u2019\
  s home with big verandah in Punjab. I saw some foreigners sitting at a corner. A\
  \ couple from Germany and Two Cyclists from England. After conversing with them,\
  \ I came to know that this is, in fact, an art gallery run by our host. There are\
  \ some empty small rooms in the gallery which work as a couch for Couchsurfers around\
  \ the world. Since it is not allowed to spend a night at the gallery, hence we need\
  \ to be discreet while entering at night. My doubts were still not fully erased.\
  \ We all sat at a rectangular table joined by our host\u2019s friends and fellow\
  \ couchsurfers, In my mind, I keep on thinking \u201CPolice gonna barged through\
  \ the main gate anytime now\u201D. But soon all my doubts/fears were diminished\
  \ as we start talking. We had some fun/interesting conversations till late in the\
  \ night while drinking Vodka/Tea and munching on Indians snacks (Courtesy by me).\
  \ They all loved Indian snacks \U0001F642 Particularly, The German couple who are\
  \ sorely missing Indian snacks from their trip to India. The 20-something couple\
  \ has been traveling around the world for more than a year via Hitchhiking and English\
  \ bikers have cycled all the way from England to Uzbekistan and their last stop\
  \ will be China. Their travel stories filled my heart with great optimism. In the\
  \ morning, we get ready before tourists flocked in. My host let me glimpse into\
  \ his unique diary noting details of every couchsurfer he hosted like name, country\
  \ of origin and their journey to Uzbekistan. Even though we don\u2019t understand\
  \ each other\u2019s language. Surprisingly, we somehow able to understand each other\u2019\
  s nuances. He came across as an earnest and hospitable person. His heart is in the\
  \ right place. At night, we all had dinner together at a Local restaurant before\
  \ I bid them adieu. It was only one night stay but the experience gave me great\
  \ confidence and hope. What started as a scary experience ended with a transformative\
  \ experience.  Thereon, I wanted to use only Couchsurfing for accommodation! On\
  \ the same trip, I got a chance to use it again, when I stayed with a Local Family\
  \ in a Kyrgyz Village. Followed by my stay with Gabit in Kazakhstan. All my Couchsurfing\
  \ experiences till now have been unique and truly fulfilling."
