Text: "I never expected to visit Iraq.\n\nFor most of my childhood until now, it has\
  \ been considered a warzone.\n\nBut now the blue stamp in my passport indicates\
  \ I have 30 days visa-free access to see it.\n\nI stand inside the sweltering immigration\
  \ shed, perspiration caused from both nerves and the brutal summer heat slowly dripping\
  \ down the back of my neck. An underqualified ceiling fan clicks monotonously above\
  \ me.\n\nThe bus that brought me here had meandered through the speckled villages\
  \ of Eastern Turkey and skirted the border of Syria, the mighty Tigris River just\
  \ a few hundred metres from the road separating us from another warzone.\n\nThe\
  \ information I had read online was vague and in need of an update, but it told\
  \ me Kurdistan, the autonomous region in the north of Iraq, was safe. To me, from\
  \ all I had seen and read in the media, it was all the same.\n\nBack on the bus,\
  \ my nerves have not been appeased.\n\nBefore us, a crumbling strip of asphalt snakes\
  \ through the dusty Mesopotamia plain fanning out endlessly.\n\nThis region had\
  \ been the Cradle of Civilisation. It is hard to believe. The recent physical damage\
  \ to houses and other structures is evident, but the fact that people have survived\
  \ in such harsh conditions for thousands of years is even more surprising. The heat\
  \ is oppressive.\n\nWe hug the city of Duhok and head south towards the battleground\
  \ of Mosul before, thankfully, turning west and soon reaching the regional capital\
  \ of Erbil.\n\nErbil has remained largely unmolested throughout the recent period\
  \ of turmoil, but the conflicts are still a scar on the mind of the people, I come\
  \ to witness.\n\nAt the bus station, I must look helpless, for the first person\
  \ to approach me, a towering man with dark eyes, speaks to me in a language I cannot\
  \ understand before reaching for a dated mobile phone in his pocket. The buttons\
  \ are so worn that the numbers no longer show on them.\n\nI call the only number\
  \ I know, that of a university professor I have exchanged messages with on Couchsurfing,\
  \ an online platform for sharing accommodation and experiences with local people\
  \ across the globe. He has offered me a thin mattress to sleep on the floor of his\
  \ sitting room for several nights, sans air conditioning or ceiling fan.\n\nWe speak\
  \ briefly before I hand the phone back to its owner. He chats to the professor before\
  \ flagging me a rusting white taxi, handing the driver a note of currency, and giving\
  \ him what I presume are directions.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the Iraq I have seen on\
  \ television. This is Kurdistan. And the difference between the two is evidently\
  \ gaping.\n\nWandering alone the following day, I seek refuge from the hellfire\
  \ heat in the colourful lanes of the covered bazaar, stores overflowing with fruit\
  \ and salted nuts, textiles, jewellery and household items.\n\nI pass a crowded\
  \ tea shop. An old man invites me to sit with him, his moustache stained yellow\
  \ from tobacco. He takes a long, slim cigarette from a packet and places it on his\
  \ bottom lip, offering me one as a small glass of sugary black tea is set before\
  \ me.\n\nHe rattles off something in Kurdish; I don\u2019t understand but I hazard\
  \ a guess and respond. \u201CAhh, Australia,\u201D he says with excitement as his\
  \ companions nod approvingly.\n\nA broken conversation ensues, and he is constantly\
  \ concerned for me. Do I need more tea? Another cigarette? Cold water? He refuses\
  \ to let me pay for any of it.\n\nHis kindness and generosity is not unique in this\
  \ part of the world. I spend several more days hitch hiking and staying with locals\
  \ in Kurdistan. I visit a makeshift care home for the physical and mentally disabled,\
  \ and for those displaced by war who are unable to care for themselves. I see roadside\
  \ refugee camps for Syrians and Iraqis fleeing war. I swim in idyllic waterfalls.\
  \ And not once do I feel unsafe.\n\nI leave behind Kurdistan buoyed by the experience.\
  \ Whilst war may have destroyed their homes, it hasn\u2019t destroyed their spirit."
