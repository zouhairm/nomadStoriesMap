Text: "Walking in the rain \n\nI knew I should have stopped. But I didn\u2019t. \n\
  Wet. \nEverywhere. \nRain seeped into my bones yet for obscure reason, I kept walking.\
  \ My sneakers had given up squeaking half an hour ago.  My backpack, struggling\
  \ with the increasing damp, shed its tears and sweat on my back. I spent the last\
  \ two hours walking around the petit village of \u0160kocjan after visiting the\
  \ \u0160kocjan caves. The serenity of the rural village on a hill prevailed against\
  \ the boisterous pouring rain. What was it I was looking for? \nDefinitely not the\
  \ rain. \nI haven\u2019t met anybody on this trip yet. A distinct contrast compared\
  \ to last week, where I had an intriguing ten minute \u201Cconversation\u201D with\
  \ a middle-aged Slovakian woman. \n \n\u201CKosice, Bratislava, Lucia Bania\u2026\
  .?\u201D She inquired again. Her tone persistent, like a mother hen pecking every\
  \ dirt off her chicks\u2019 feathers.\n I nodded vehemently since body language\
  \ was the only bridge between us. I tried my best to catch a glimpse of English\
  \ but all I could comprehend was Kosice and Bratislava. I\u2019m sinking deeper\
  \ into the sinkhole, utterly hopeless.  However, with an expectant look from such\
  \ a benevolent and eager face, I tried again, the tenth time.   \n\u201CYou,\u201D\
  \ pointed my finger towards her.\n \u201CKosice,  Home?\u201D \nI already tried\
  \ \u201CYou from Kosice?\u201D \nShe nodded enthusiastically, her brunette ponytail\
  \ bounced up and down as she gestured to the villages near Jasov. \n\u201CKosice,\
  \ Bratislava, Lucia Bania, Medzev,  Stos!\u201D \nWe could see three nearby villages\
  \ from the viewpoint, clustered red roofs, a miniature Legoland.\n\u201CI came from\
  \ Kosice, going to Bratislava tomorrow.\u201D I replied. \nTechnology would have\
  \ been the rope to save  me but I didn\u2019t have data. After a couple seconds\
  \ looking at each other, both of us smiled and shrugged simultaneously, acknowledging\
  \ the fact that we won\u2019t ever understand each other. She popped a gummy bear\
  \ into her mouth and stuffed five pieces of candies in my hand. This I understand.\
  \ \n\u201CChina?\u201D \nI shook my head and pointed to my hat with Taiwanese flag,\n\
  \ \u201CNo, Taiwan\u201D\nShe nodded hesitantly, I pointed to the flag, again.\n\
  \u201CTaiwan, not China.\u201D \nNow, the Taiwanese flag is barely visible after\
  \ taking a thorough bath, quite an accurate depiction of Taiwan\u2019s position\
  \ in the world right now.  I ducked under two trees for temporary cover and dug\
  \ out a Margot Coconut chocolate bar, one of the five pieces of candies she gave\
  \ me. It was squished but not wet, which was all I could ask for. Unwrapping the\
  \ chocolate brought up more poignant memories from last week. \n\n\u201CMe give\
  \ you money?\u201D  Six or seven local kids asked as I walked down from the Jasov\
  \ cave viewpoint.\n\u201COk.\u201D  I pretended to not understand and held my palm\
  \ out. \nThe kids, with incentives, quickly corrected their mistakes \n\u201CNo,\
  \ you give me money\u201D\n\u201CI don\u2019t have any.\u201D I shrugged.\n\u201C\
  You got chocolate?\u201D They changed their tactics.  \n\u201CI don\u2019t, sorry.\u201D\
  \ I showed them my empty pockets. I forgot all about the candies the Slovakian lady\
  \ gave me. I had stuffed them at the bottom of my backpack. \n\u201CGoodbye, it\u2019\
  s nice to meet you.\u201D I waved and continued walking, needed to catch the bus\
  \ back to Kosice.  \nA couple more steps later I heard someone shouted,\n\u201C\
  Fuck you! Fuck Fuck you.\u201D \nI heard some kid shush him, probably one of the\
  \ older kids. Then...\n\u201CFuck you! Fuck you!\u201D in a louder volume. \nI chuckled,\
  \ at least they got the order of pronouns right this time. \nThe rain taunted me\
  \ by repeating the kids words. Should I head back? That thought has revolved around\
  \ my head so many times it surpassed Earth rotating around the Sun. Three months\
  \ doing workaway and traveling has an unexpected exhausting toll on me.  I am tired\
  \ of looking \"different\". I am tired of language barrier. I am tired of constantly\
  \ planning.  \n But right now, standing under the trees, rain pouring relentlessly,\
  \ I felt a sense of peace. Something about this small village situated on a hill\
  \ brought out the sense of belonging and reinvigorated my love for travel. \n So\
  \ I kept walking, in the rain."
