Text: "We use to have throughout our lives; a detailed list of instructions to follow,\
  \ but suddenly people tell us that we are the ones who choose our own path? -I was\
  \ confused. Luckily, I had this crazy sister who always had the solution. -You must\
  \ go to XILITLA, they are going to open the biggest and eccentric gemstone market\
  \ in all of Mexico; if you look closely you will find what you are looking for,\
  \ the exhibition will be in the old surrealist castle of Mr. Edward James. My eyes\
  \ lit up.\nSix hours on the road in the whimsical circulating orography of the Sierra\
  \ Madre, this small town called Xilitla (Place of snails), is the end point of the\
  \ snail drawn by the mountains that form it. The exhibition was huge and very bizarre.\
  \ But I had a mission, I had to obtain the \"Clarity\" stone. I did not expect that\
  \ the exhibit would be inside a surrealist castle. I did not even know what surrealism\
  \ meant, despite that, a fascination leapt out of my eyes as I discovered this silent\
  \ paradise of waterfalls, I was not sure if there was a castle inside the jungle,\
  \ or if the castle had a JUNGLE inside of it, it really defies any logic. Rooms\
  \ without walls, structures that did not fit in the mind, labyrinthine roads with\
  \ leaves that changed color. The harmony that the castle had with nature was overwhelming\
  \ and pleasant at the same time.\n-A map! I thought. -There is no road. An old lady\
  \ who was selling passion fruits told me. -If you pay attention Mr. Edward will\
  \ guide you. - FOLLOW THE EYES THAT LOOK TO HEAVEN! She cried as I walked away.\
  \ I went deeper into the castle until I got to James' balcony where he used to take\
  \ his lunch with the universe. \n-Excuse me, do you ... I did not finish my question\
  \ when he interrupted me -Juan.\n-Sorry Juan, I'm looking for the CLARITY stone.\
  \ -Only few people understand this place, his voice was almost imperceptible, -my\
  \ grandfather used to work for him, the stones of clarity are sold in the Tower\
  \ of Hope, go straight through the Muslim structures, take three stairs and you\
  \ will arrive. \nI saw everything, flowers and snakes both real and made of stone,\
  \ everything; except the Muslim structures, so I was getting worried. Suddenly,\
  \ a gothic girl stood in front of me, -\"You're pretty, you should take a picture\"\
  . Although I found it weird, I agreed, and when I looked at it, I was totally surprised\
  \ to see that the stone snakes were drawing the illusion of the Taj Mahal with their\
  \ shadows on the floor. It was the light. I left as fast as I could and arrived\
  \ at a huge square surrounded by birds, I heard a tourist guide say -Welcome to\
  \ the garden of bromelias, heart of the castle, here Mr. Edward rewarded his employees.\
  \ \nThe sounds of the jungle increased as the light diminished, everything took\
  \ a different order. Finally, I reached the Tower of Hope, with such a view that\
  \ you had to pay special attention to realize if it is real. There were hundreds\
  \ of mirrors that reflected the low light of the fire. Finally, I found it! in a\
  \ small linen basket, with a note written in pencil, \"stones of clarity\".\nI came\
  \ home very satisfied with what I had achieved. I found a note from my sister that\
  \ said. \"The gift was not the stone, it is the depth that this trip made you understand\"\
  . By changing perspectives, following my heart and flowing with my senses; -I got\
  \ it. I understood that I didn't need to know what the path was, I always knew it,\
  \ what I needed was the bravery and the courage to do it. A different context is\
  \ usually a different way of thinking, the surreal garden shows images that reflect\
  \ the functioning of the subconscious. It shows YOU in specific, what YOU want to\
  \ see, that is, what is inside you and therefore, who you really are. \nLet's get\
  \ lost in the jungle so that when we meet this time, it will be real."
