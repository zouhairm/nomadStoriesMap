Text: "Soak your memories in a warm cup of Kahwah Tea, while indulging in the varied\
  \ landscapes of Kashmir.  A valley between the Great Himalayan range and the Pir\
  \ Panjal mountain range, Kashmir is a place of beautiful simplicity and pristine\
  \ natural beauty. Kashmir is painted with a unique culture that keeps you intrigued\
  \ throughout your journey, from Srinagar to Sonamarg and Gulmarg till Pahalgam.\
  \ \nWhen I landed at Srinagar, I felt a sense of peace and ease. Nothing felt more\
  \ soothing than letting your fingers glide through the chill waters of the Dal Lake,\
  \ while chatting with family on a Shikara boat. The Dal Lake is surrounded by a\
  \ variety of deciduous trees that promise a colourful show in their fall season.\
  \ The weather in Kashmir is an experience of its own.\n\nA holiday in the midst\
  \ of a valley is enough to create memories on its own, but what made this trip more\
  \ memorable to me, were the people and their arts and crafts. The Kashmiris, unlike\
  \ the political strife that their state has been under, are very peaceful. They\
  \ are homely and hospitable. While visiting a few handicraft stores, I was intrigued\
  \ to find that the shawls, craftwork and d\xE9cors (made out of walnut or maple\
  \ wood) were made by people in their homes. Instead of building large-scale industries\
  \ that mechanically produce souvenirs for its tourists, people made handicrafts\
  \ at home and sold them as business. What I found fascinating about this was that\
  \ each d\xE9cor or shawl was unique and never exactly the same and differed from\
  \ one shop to the other. Thus, it\u2019s a truly unique souvenir that you bring\
  \ back home.\nKashmir is a wonderful idea for a visit, especially for those wishing\
  \ to experience teeth chattering temperatures and snow for the first time. Sonamarg\
  \ and Gulmarg promise a lot of fun in the snow and ensure you fly home with snow-capped\
  \ memories imprinted in your mind\u2019s eye.\n\nEnticing cold temperatures with\
  \ snowfall is one of the many things that Pahalgam has to offer. The weather unlike\
  \ the blistering cold in Gulmarg, nurtures a variety of apples orchards, vast fields\
  \ of saffron as well as an array of dry fruits. Pahalgam is a wonderful place to\
  \ visit for its unique parks like Bethab Valley, Aru Valley and Chandan Valley.\
  \ A morning walk or a short stroll can never do justice to the amount of natural\
  \ beauty there is to see. Bethab valley has vast sunny lawns spotted with clusters\
  \ of tall, coniferous trees. There\u2019s a gushing stream cutting through the park\
  \ that keeps you company while you gaze at the white Himalayan range.\n\nKashmir\
  \ was a wonderful experience and certainly a place that I shall visit often. Even\
  \ after a week, I realised that there is so much more to explore. I am yet to experience\
  \ their fall season, their scintillating apples and more of their mesmerizing landscapes."
