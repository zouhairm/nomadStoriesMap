Text: "It was a lovely, cool morning in Ireland and I was ready to meet the land my\
  \ grandmother was from. It was a beautiful as she said it was and the air was fresh\
  \ and smelled of cut grass. I was excited and ready to go as I was going off the\
  \ tourist track. I was going to explore the Ireland that most tourists didn't see.\
  \ Siobhan O'Hare was my guide. There would be time, later, to explore the rest of\
  \ Ireland but, today, we were heading to Furry Glen, Phoenix Park. I suppose I should\
  \ start from the beginning. I met Siobhan in Vancouver and she mentioned that she\
  \ was homesick for her homelands and told me about Ireland. I listened in rapt attention\
  \ as she spoke of the many Irish legends that her grandparents told her including\
  \ the story of Finn MacCool who decided to eat a salmon to gain knowledge from it.\
  \ Juice from the salmon squirted on his thumb while it was cooking and he put his\
  \ thumb to his mouth to cool it. Instantly, he knew everything the salmon knew!\
  \ So, after a breakfast of bacon, beans and bubble and squeak, we were off! \nWe\
  \ got to Furry Glen and I would have been content to sit and listen to the birds\
  \ chatter on this fine Spring day and watch people walk by, immersed in their own\
  \ thoughts but Siobhan had other ideas. She said, \"Let's walk up this way towards\
  \ the forest.\" It was her homelands so I followed. Along the way, I saw a fallow\
  \ deer with her fawn and Eurasian Jays flying by. We walked for 2 kilometers when\
  \ we came to a small path leading deeper into the woods and she said this was where\
  \ we were going. \nDeeper and deeper we went and I felt a little shiver go down\
  \ my spine and wondered, in silence, if this was a safe thing to do as I didn't\
  \ even really know Siobhan but I continued, if haltingly. We finally stopped in\
  \ the deep forest in front of a little door, about three feet high and a person\
  \ came out, dressed in clothing of old Ireland, 1892. He had a green suit on with\
  \ a vest and button down shirt and black shoes. He stood about three feet tall.\
  \ He invited us into his home, in the tree and I thought, \"That is too small to\
  \ fit us all.\" but I continued in and was amazed that there was a whole home, the\
  \ size of a football field and was furnished in antique furniture. We sat down with\
  \ a cup of tea and listened to Patrick for hours as he told us of the way Ireland\
  \ was before the 1900s. I was delighted to listen to him and felt I could have stayed\
  \ forever but I decided to go back to the hotel and rest for the night's festivities.\
  \ I thanked Patrick for his hospitality and we went out the door. \nI was shocked\
  \ to realize that only an hour had passed and it was still morning! I was sure we\
  \ had been with Patrick at least seven hours, we had lunch and dinner with him.\
  \ Siobhan took me back to the hotel and I rested for an hour and went to have lunch.\
  \ I asked the front desk if Siobhan had left a message for me to meet her and they\
  \ looked at me in a mystified manner and said, \"Who is Siobhan? You have been in\
  \ your room since you arrived yesterday. We were getting worried about you.\" \n\
  Now it was my turn to be a little scared! I quickly looked for Siobhan's number\
  \ in my phone, although I knew it by heart, and it wasn't there! I trembled in fear\
  \ because I was certain I went to Phoenix Park with her and the Innkeepers said\
  \ I hadn't left. I know this would stay with me a long time because I had no explanation\
  \ for it so I finished my vacation and went back to Canada. I couldn't wait to go\
  \ back to Ireland though!"
