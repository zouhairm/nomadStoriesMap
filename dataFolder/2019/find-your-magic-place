Text: "Find your magic place, a place that makes you happy, somewhere close enough\
  \ so you can go regularly, but far enough so you can dream to go back.\n\nEven if\
  \ I'm always looking to travel abroad, I made a promise that I would travel more\
  \ through my country, Mexico. So I booked bus tickets to Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca,\
  \ an 8 hours trip from Mexico City. I was excited because I'd never been there before,\
  \ but at the same time I didn't have much expectations, what could I find? another\
  \ pretty Mexican beach?\nSo I got to \"Puerto\", and the moment I put my feet on\
  \ its land it felt different and I felt happy.\nThen I took a taxi, like almost\
  \ every taxi driver in the area this one was very chatty. \"Oh so, you're not staying\
  \ in Puerto, you're going to La Punta\" he said in an interrogative way. I was contemplating\
  \ the ocean in the distance so I did't get the chance to answer. \"You'll love La\
  \ Punta, is peaceful and nice\" he ended. \"You know, I think I will\" I said.\n\
  I arrived to Caba\xF1as Aloe, a very beautiful hostel with a tropical vibe, pretty\
  \ cabins and a few adopted animals. Lu, the owner, a woman with good and strong\
  \ energy, was there to receive me. She took me to my cottage and then she showed\
  \ me the whole place and how things worked there. At the moment she left, I changed\
  \ clothes to my swimming suit. I couldn't wait to go to the beach. So I walked just\
  \ two blocks and there it was the Pacific Ocean, huge and imposing but calm, it\
  \ was like It was saying welcome to me.\nThat night was full moon, perfect to go\
  \ to swim to the Manialtepec lagoon, a place with luminiscence water. Once there,\
  \ on the right spot, the guide asked \"who wants to be the first one?\" Of course\
  \ I said \"me\", and I jumped out of the boat. I started to swim slowly through\
  \ millions of luminisceced microorganisms, and I started to think \"this place is\
  \ magical\".\nThe next day I met G\xFCino, the owner of a surf shop. We spent the\
  \ week surfing, in which he taught me patience because sometimes you need to wait\
  \ and wait till a good wave comes.\nI've always said that I'm from the sea, but\
  \ this time I made a genuine connection with it, I sense the permission of the ocean\
  \ to surf and that was the moment where I realized it was pure magic.\nThe next\
  \ days I experimented their food, their mezcal, the little roadtrips to nearby towns,\
  \ but most of all their people. \nThat trip changed my mind on traveling, because\
  \ this time I didn't feel I was on a trip, I felt I belong there.\n\nEver since,\
  \ I've return to my magic place many times, each time is different, each time has\
  \ been better."
