Text: "Nothing was what I expected, nothing ever is. I don\u2019t remember exactly\
  \ the path that took me there but I recall a guy who helped me on the street and\
  \ a little boy, maybe his younger brother, who cried while he was talking to me,\
  \ \u201CHey, are we gonna play or what?\u201D I just smiled and kept walking. \n\
  \nI\u2019m a lot of things: I\u2019m a journalist, a marketer, a reader, sometimes\
  \ I\u2019m a painter, other times I\u2019m a leader and so on, but there are two\
  \ things I have never stopped being and never will: I\u2019m a writer and a backpacker.\
  \ So there I was, in the London streets in the middle of May, with a backpack on\
  \ my shoulder and a map on my hand. I was looking for something I dreamed since\
  \ I was a little child. I\u2019m the kind of girl who believes in fairy tales, and\
  \ there\u2019s one special story that makes my heart beat; I was looking for the\
  \ boy who never grew up, I was looking for Peter Pan. I used to wait awake for him\
  \ every night \u2018till I was eleven years old. He, Peter of course, never passed\
  \ by my window. So when I decided to go to London, I knew I had to find him. \n\n\
  I walked all around Hyde Park, where I met the swans for the first time in my life,\
  \ and I made friends with the squirrels,  who seem to be a unique kind, the ones\
  \ that are not afraid of humans and get close enough when they think you have food.\
  \  I walked until Kensington Gardens where I got lost, definitely. The good thing\
  \ about London on May is the weather, there\u2019s not much sun and it\u2019s a\
  \ little cold, so\u2026 losing yourself on a big  park in the middle of the city\
  \ is not a bad idea on that time of year. Instead on being worried I took my time.\
  \ The trees were so wonderful, tall and green as a forest. I started to think about\
  \ James M. Barrie, I imagine him walking for the same paths I was, picturing himself\
  \ sitting and writing. What he had seen, how he decided to get closer to the  Davies\
  \ Family?, Was he able to tell the exact moment when he saw Peter for the first\
  \ time? Magical smells everywhere and I couldn\u2019t believe that I was walking\
  \ on the place Peter Pan was born. \n\nDawn was getting closer when I finally met\
  \ my boy. I found him next to the Serpentine, happy, cheerfully, cute as I always\
  \ imagined he would be. He was playing the flute and little fairies surrounded him.\
  \ That exact moment, I felt peace. When I first decided to look for him I wasn\u2019\
  t sure what I was going to find,  sure, I found a statue, but more than that, I\
  \ found the boy that makes me dream since childhood, I found my Peter Pan. He was\
  \ exactly the way I dreamt about, but nothing was what I expected, there, at my\
  \ 22 years of age he still made me smile.  So I sat down next to him and started\
  \ writing."
