Text: "\u201CFine, but I want someone with strong hands\u201D, I finally yielded to\
  \ the massage parlor tout. However, considering that he was also peddling tickets\
  \ to the infamous \u2018ping pong\u2019 show at a strip club nearby, I added, \u201C\
  and no male masseur, please.\u201D\n\nHe led me to an alley off the main road, lined\
  \ with go-go bars on both sides. The deafening music blaring from all around, the\
  \ dizzying psychedelic patterns dancing from enormous LED screens and skimpily clad\
  \ human Barbies suggestively waving out to tourists, made this feel like an acid\
  \ trip. The famous Bangla Road in Phuket, Thailand, was possibly the biggest draw\
  \ for visitors and I could see why. This was the Mecca of human debauchery.\n \n\
  Her wide, angular face scrunched up as she revealed a toothy grin. The loud make-up\
  \ had settled into her laugh lines but couldn\u2019t conceal her Adam\u2019s apple.\
  \ Clever, I decided, that they had assigned me to a transsexual female. A masseuse,\
  \ who doubled up as a lady-boy after hours, as I would later learn.\n\nI found myself\
  \ musing on the previous day\u2019s article on how to spot a lady-boy. Apart from\
  \ the Adam\u2019s apple, there were the \u2018taller than average\u2019 and \u2018\
  broad shoulders\u2019; two traits I myself was endowed with and teased for, all\
  \ my adult life. So much so, that it was habitual for me to hunch my shoulders and\
  \ stand or walk with a stoop; made me appear less of an amazon. \n\nAs I hunkered\
  \ down on the rancid mattress in the dingy massage room, the smell of \u2018Tiger\
  \ Balm\u2019 filled up my nostrils. Lamai, my masseuse, now began working on me.\
  \ Strong hands: Check!\n\nLike most people here, Lamai\u2019s knowledge of English\
  \ was rather rudimentary. She barely managed a \u201CGood?\u201D in her effected,\
  \ singsong tone of voice, as she checked with me if the pressure was alright. Every\
  \ time she saw me flinch from a tickle or wince in pain from all the grotesque pulling\
  \ of limbs and cracking of knuckles, she would let out a carefully orchestrated\
  \ \u201CSorry!\u201D. My tendons started relaxing and knots were coming undone.\n\
  \nMy mind wandered off back home to India, where countless stigmas are attached\
  \ to gender ambiguity. The only transgender people one encounters, are begging for\
  \ money at either traffic signals or at ceremonies like weddings, offering blessings\
  \ in return. Then there was that recent incident of the only transgender political\
  \ candidate gone missing, possibly kidnapped. Trans-phobic violence wasn\u2019t\
  \ uncommon and despite equal laws, they remain an insular community; often shunned\
  \ and mainly surviving through begging or sex work.\n\nAll terseness aside, Lamai\
  \ went about her job with ample grace and dignity. Decadent Schmecadent! I had a\
  \ new-found respect for this country and its society that had lovingly accepted\
  \ a largely neglected community.\n\n \u201CYour noSS bOOtipOOl!\u201D, she cooed\
  \ at one point, when she realized that I had noticed her staring at me a couple\
  \ of times. Her eyes never wandered off to my body, so it was certainly not voyeuristic.\
  \ It was something on my face.\n\n Sensing my inability to decipher her words, she\
  \ tried explaining herself in gestures. She first pinched her nose and scowled;\
  \ like there was an unpleasant odor. She then pointed to her bosom and made a gleeful\
  \ face, with an animated expression in her eyes.  Next, she touched my nose and\
  \ with eyebrows raised in admiration, gave me an approving look. She touched her\
  \ nose again and bobbed her head. I was none the wiser.\n\nIt took me ten minutes\
  \ to understand her. Unhappy with the shape of her nose, she intended to go under\
  \ the knife, the way she had had breast augmentation done. She had taken a liking\
  \ to my nose and now wanted profile pictures for reference.\n\nHer candor blew me\
  \ away. Here was someone who truly owned her body and was unapologetically unabashed\
  \ about its \u2018imperfections\u2019; making me rethink the morbid shame with which\
  \ I regarded mine. Mental knots were coming undone too.\n\nI dressed up and got\
  \ up. Standing up as tall as I possibly could, I asked her to get her camera. Flaunting\
  \ my shoulders in all their glory, I posed for the best goddamn profile picture\
  \ of my life."
