Text: "Back in the Uruguayan coast, I had my first experience volunteering in a hostel,\
  \ in Punta del Este. My roll there was to assist Wilson, the man in charge of the\
  \ hostel maintenance and a very passionate supporter of Pe\xF1arol, one of the main\
  \ football teams in the country. Football, not soccer, as South Americans always\
  \ make sure to clarify.\nAs a Brazilian, football was also a big deal to me, having\
  \ grown watching great players on TV, playing fierceful matches with my friends\
  \ and supporting my team in the pitch. With the sport as a common subject, it was\
  \ quite easy to bond with Wilson. We definitely spent more time talking about our\
  \ favorite players and the great moments in football history than doing proper maintenance\
  \ work. It took us over an hour to prepare a cement mix because our focus was on\
  \ arguing which of our teams had the best supporting crowd: his Carboneros from\
  \ Pe\xF1arol, or the Faithful Hawks from Corinthians, my home team.\nOur local leagues\
  \ might not be as competitive and profitable as the ones in Europe, but football\
  \ still has a great impact in our continent, particularly for the supporters. It\u2019\
  s a religion: instead of going to the mass, football fans worship their idols in\
  \ the stadium, and of course Wilson was one of the followers. Being an associate\
  \ member of the club, as proudly shown in his membership card, he hasn\u2019t missed\
  \ a single home match during the 3 months I\u2019ve been in Uruguay.\nOne match\
  \ in particular was more important than any other: \u201CEl Cl\xE1sico\u201D, when\
  \ Pe\xF1arol faced their main rival Nacional. Supporters from both crowds would\
  \ rather win this single confrontation than the Uruguayan Tournament itself. In\
  \ this specific date, there was nowhere else Wilson would rather be but the Centenario,\
  \ home of the first World Cup Final. This legendary stadium hosted this clash of\
  \ titans, experience which I had the privilege to share with him.\nI always mentioned\
  \ Wilson I would love to mingle with the Pe\xF1arol fans, supporting the team in\
  \ the pitch, but he told me it was tricky for those who weren\u2019t associate members\
  \ to get tickets, even more for such a huge event as \u201CEl Cl\xE1sico\u201D.\
  \ Less than one week before the match, I had barely no hope of attending to it,\
  \ till Wilson surprises me with a plastic bag, containing a Pe\xF1arol t-shirt,\
  \ an entrance to \u201CEl Cl\xE1sico\u201D and one note that said: \u201Cto my dear\
  \ Brazilian Carbonero, if he has the nuts\u201D. Without a doubt I had them, and\
  \ I started to prepare myself to live the experience to the fullest.\nI\u2019ve\
  \ searched Youtube videos from their \u201Cbarra\u201D, as the football fan firms\
  \ are called in South America, to be able to sing along with them. Most of the content\
  \ were songs insulting Nacional and reminding them of their worst defeats to Pe\xF1\
  arol. We took a bus with all their supporters from Punta del Este to join the rest\
  \ of them in Montevideo, and during the bus ride everyone was screaming all the\
  \ songs I\u2019ve looked up before. It was a rehearsal to the main stage. The smile\
  \ of Wilson when he heard a Brazilian following all the lyrics, that not even himself\
  \ knew by heart, was priceless.\nOnce we got to the Centenario, it felt like everyone\
  \ was getting ready to take part in a war against their worst enemy. Uniforms, flags,\
  \ drum beats, screams, face painting\u2026 a giant wave of black and yellow, the\
  \ colors of Pe\xF1arol, flooded the Uruguayan capital, and I was another man in\
  \ their army. But inside the stadium, in the opposite edge we saw our true enemies.\
  \ Not the players from Nacional, but their fans themselves. We worried more about\
  \ who were being louder than keeping track on the actual game. That\u2019s the beauty\
  \ of football in the so called \u201Cthird world\u201D: we do not depend on the\
  \ players to have a nice spectacle. The final score? 1x1, lousy football and few\
  \ highlights, but it truly didn\u2019t matter. We were the real protagonists and,\
  \ thanks to Wilson, I could be an acting part of the show."
