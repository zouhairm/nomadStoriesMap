Text: "When I told my parents that I was going to visit Marrakech in January with\
  \ my sister, they didn\u2019t hesitate to share their opinion, in the diplomatic\
  \ way they always use for sensitive issues, but with the clear bottom line \u201C\
  we don\u2019t want you to go because we don\u2019t think it would be safe for two\
  \ young girls\u201D. Obviously, I ignored them.\n\nIt was supposed to be my first\
  \ big trip, the first time out of settled Europe into the wilderness of an Arab\
  \ country with Berber traditions that have lasted for centuries. I obviously did\
  \ some research before leaving, which proved reassuring, but I still felt unprepared\
  \ for what I was going to experience. The different travel articles emphasized certain\
  \ tourist attractions or places that tourists enjoy, gave advice on how to handle\
  \ food and water, to be careful with pushy vendors, and all assured the readers\
  \ that it is a perfectly safe place for women; we were simply advised to wear humble\
  \ clothing at all times.\n\nAnd they were right. My sister and I felt perfectly\
  \ safe throughout the duration of the trip and the only thing that attracted the\
  \ locals\u2019 attention was my bright honey blonde hair, which mostly happened\
  \ while we were browsing the colorful souks, where they were more abundant that\
  \ inside the tourist attractions areas like Bahia Palace or Le Jardin Majorelle.\n\
  \nIn the former glory of the Bahia Palace, even my hair paled away. Being emptied\
  \ of furniture only made the Arabic architecture stand out louder. I was completely\
  \ mesmerized. I passed through room and room feeling unworthy of its beauty and\
  \ insignificant, having eyes only for its walls, like the rest of the tourists.\n\
  \nLater at our hostel, we met another girl coming from the UK. Exchanging impressions,\
  \ she asked me if I had been harassed by the locals because of my hair. Surprised\
  \ by her question, I told her that vendors approached me like any other tourist\
  \ and backed off politely after saying simply \u201Cla, sukran\u201D or \u201Cnon,\
  \ merci\u201D. \n\nThen, I wanted to experience Marrakech in the most authentic\
  \ way: walking among the souks. They were filled with heaps of spices blending into\
  \ a small hill of taste, with fruits and nuts of whose sweetness I was sure by the\
  \ way bees were drawn to the boxes, intricate jewellery, carefully handmade scarfs,\
  \ laying long and frail in the sun, clothes, small nothings like key chains or fridge\
  \ magnets, and a multitude of oils and beauty products. I was so caught up in them,\
  \ that at first, I didn\u2019t notice the curious looks some of the locals were\
  \ throwing me.\n\nSome of them, bolder than the others, were trying to guess where\
  \ I was from. \u201CIrish?\u201D, \u201CSwedish?\u201D they asked me and I told\
  \ them that I\u2019m Romanian, but currently living in the UK, and to further extinguish\
  \ their curiosity, I would simply add that it wasn\u2019t my natural hair, it was\
  \ dyed. Afterward, they would leave, throwing me the same warm smile, without seeming\
  \ disappointed, some even telling me before they left that they heard of Romania\
  \ or that they met other Romanian tourists. \n\nA vendor even told me that my hair\
  \ looked like the sun, which brought me a lot of joy; another jokingly offered to\
  \ dye it using his natural made wool dyes, which made me laugh and further amaze\
  \ at the kindness of these people. I kept thinking that their customer service is\
  \ extraordinary. They would often ask for \u2018a surprise\u2019 or \u2018a tip\u2019\
  \ at the end, which I felt they truly earned.\n\nThe beauty and warmth of Marrakech,\
  \ radiating not only from the sun and the land\u2019s richnesses, but so much from\
  \ its people, made my entire trip a pleasant indulgence in flavors, smells, sights,\
  \ and human kindness. Finally, I understood why poetry was born in the desert."
