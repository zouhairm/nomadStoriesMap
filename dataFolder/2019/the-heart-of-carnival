Text: "My stomach was full of pillowy lemon pie and caf\xE9 con leche when I exited\
  \ the bakery with two girls from my travel group. The morning\u2019s mischievously\
  \ dark clouds had retreated and the sun bathed the adobe buildings in warmth. The\
  \ Carnival celebration in Urubamba\u2019s town square was scheduled to start soon,\
  \ although the week\u2019s trip had taught me that time was malleable in Peru. \n\
  \nOur host mother told us that Carnival would bring together Peruvians from all\
  \ reaches of the Sacred Valley, which had been ravished by a monstrous flood a few\
  \ weeks earlier. The banks of the Urubamba River had exploded into the valley with\
  \ the pent up rage of a month\u2019s worth of constant rain. The violent tides twisted\
  \ through the town\u2019s sturdy center and feasted on the vulnerable farmlands.\
  \ \n\nFrom where we stood in the heart of the town, the flood\u2019s devastation\
  \ was barely visible; a stark reminder of economical imbalance we had seen in the\
  \ region. \n\nWe made our way down the narrow cobblestone street when Dani, our\
  \ group\u2019s mother hen, was doused with water from behind. She yelped and felt\
  \ the back of her shirt to confirm its wetness. Before I realized what had happened,\
  \ I was hit square in the back of the head with a blast of water. \n\n\u201CGringos!\u201D\
  \ a young boy screamed with excitement, as Olivia, our group\u2019s third member,\
  \ was drenched. \n\nWe turned to find a gaggle of Peruvian kids armed with foam\
  \ water guns laughing at us. It was the first time since we arrived a week earlier\
  \ that we heard laughter from the locals. \n\nStill puzzled by the water attack,\
  \ I looked to Dani for answers. \n\n\u201CCarnival,\u201D she smiled.\n \nWater\
  \ fights were a common part of Carnival celebrations; a fact Dani and our host mother\
  \ had neglected to tell us that morning. Being white college students, or gringos,\
  \ we were prime targets for the local tradition. \n\nThe kids raised their water\
  \ blasters at us and we knew there was only one thing to do. Run!\n \nWe ran past\
  \ the churro and street meat carts, the hand pressed juice stand and ducked into\
  \ a small corner store to catch our breaths. My lungs stung with each inhale of\
  \ thin air, but I couldn\u2019t stop giggling. \n\n\u201CThis is fun and all, but\
  \ we\u2019re getting soaked,\u201D Dani said, ringing out her blonde ponytail. She\
  \ pointed to the pile of water guns next to the register. \u201CWho\u2019s in?\u201D\
  \n\nTravel novices, we followed Dani\u2019s experienced lead. We pooled our money\
  \ and bought the pistolas. But we were lacking in aqua. From the comfort of the\
  \ store, Dani and I observed the Peruvians knocking on front doors to fill up a\
  \ bucket of water. I quickly purchased a bucket and signaled the girls that we were\
  \ ready.\n\nDani stealthy made her way down the street, with us baby chicks falling\
  \ in line behind her. She knocked on the first door she spotted. A plump woman,\
  \ with a colorful apron tied around her waist answered. \n\n\u201CA-GOO-WA?\u201D\
  \ Dani pleaded. \n\n\u201CNO A-GOO,\u201D the woman emphasized the ooh. \u201CWA,\u201D\
  \ she mocked. \n\nI ran to the next door I saw. \u201CAh-gua?\u201D I asked the\
  \ stranger. \n\nShe pointed to our bucket and I quickly handed it to her. She disappeared\
  \ into the house and returned promptly with a full bucket. To our left, the kids\
  \ turned the street corner and came running towards us. \n\nWe stuck our guns into\
  \ the bucket, pulled back the barrel to fill them and held them up confidently.\
  \ The kids stopped in their tracks and made funny faces at us, begging to be bathed\
  \ in water. \n\nWe fired all at once. Our aim was not nearly as good as theirs but\
  \ it sent them running. We looked for another house to fill up at and the kids came\
  \ back strong while we waited for our bucket to be replenished. \n\nThe water war\
  \ continued throughout Urubamba until the stage presentation of Carnival began.\
  \ In the center of town, wearing a shirt emblazoned with the slogan \u201Cvolunteer\
  \ to change lives in Peru,\u201D I smiled deeply at the kids who had turned me into\
  \ a sopping puddle. Their laughs echoed in my heart long after returning home."
