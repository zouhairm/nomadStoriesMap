Text: "My favorite method of exploring a place is by running. Compared to walking,\
  \ running to explore is quicker and makes one feel more like a local instead of\
  \ a tourist. With that slight increase in adrenaline level, you decide which way\
  \ to turn based on your gut feelings instead of your travel book or Google map.\
  \ Running is my way to find inspiration. Here are some of the interesting incidents\
  \ that happened during my runs in Tokyo.\n\nStory 1: Soaked up in the Rain\n\nIt\
  \ was my first run to Shibuya. That night, my friend and I decided to venture into\
  \ the crowds unplugged. Originally, we planned to go and come back the same route.\
  \ However, a dark, mysterious alley intrigued us and threw us off path. Along that\
  \ alley, we saw a lot of family-style restaurants, izakaya (Japanese-style bar)\
  \ and love hotels and ended up on a busy street with no idea of where we were. Then,\
  \ all of a sudden it started raining buckets. Empty handed, we could not count on\
  \ Google Map. Our only option was to ask. The problem was, both of us were novices\
  \ in Japanese. All we could do was to keep asking \u201CKomaba-Todaimae wa doko\
  \ des ka\u201D (\u201CWhere is Komaba-Todaimae station?\u201D) to random people\
  \ on the street. However, we did not understand 90% of the things they replied in\
  \ Japanese and actually ran further away from home. In fact, we asked eight different\
  \ people, including a policeman, before we finally got home drenched from being\
  \ caught in the heavy rain for two hours. Getting lost in heavy rain in an unfamiliar\
  \ city was certainly an interesting experience. It was my first time to get in touch\
  \ with local Japanese people. Not sure if I made a good first impression looking\
  \ like a drowned rat.\n\n\nStory 2: Run for Cookies and Karaoke\n\nOne time me and\
  \ my friend were running along the street opposite to Harajuku station. A banner\
  \ advertising \u201Ckaraoke for free cookie\u201D caught our attention.\n\u201C\
  We can definitely do this! We\u2019ve run for 20 minutes already, now I\u2019m ready\
  \ to sing and eat!\u201D said my friend. So, we went in. The staff said we can either\
  \ sing one song together and get a small cookie each, or we can sing solo and get\
  \ a huge cookie each. \n\u201CSo, if we sing individually first and then sing one\
  \ together, we can get a big one and a small one?\u201D\n\u201CNo, you can only\
  \ get one cookie, but you can sing as many songs as you want!\u201D said the staff.\n\
  Fair enough. Free karaoke with one piece of warm chewy cookie, what more could we\
  \ have asked for? What is the purpose of running? To eat more! That\u2019s the spirit!\n\
  \nStory 3: Bumped into a Party\n\n\u201CHoly moly! Tomorrow\u2019s Halloween Party,\
  \ what are we going to wear?\u201D my friend kind of freaked out a bit when she\
  \ realized Halloween was a day to go and she had no costume to wear. \n\u201CLet\u2019\
  s run to Shibuya to get costumes!\u201D I said.\nRunning to Shibuya the day before\
  \ Halloween was probably the worst idea ever. It is just like volunteering to get\
  \ squeezed into pulp. Starting from around October 29, Shibuya would be occupied\
  \ by people dressed in Halloween costumes at night, and eventually become a massive\
  \ street party on the night of Halloween. We did not even need to walk, because\
  \ the massive crowd composed of \u201Czombies\u201D, \u201CTenga\u201D, \u201CPresident\
  \ Trump\u201D et cetera pushed us forward. Although our running plan was destroyed,\
  \ we got our costumes and accidentally walked in one of the grandest parties in\
  \ the world.\n\nRunning is a quick and exciting way to get to know the soul of a\
  \ city. Sometimes things go wrong and your plans will have an unexpected turn, but\
  \ I can guarantee the joy you gained from this surprise will trump that gained from\
  \ your original plan. Just like in life, the best memories is often not something\
  \ we planned, but something unexpected. Time to grab your sneakers, get out of your\
  \ comfort zone and see where your feet will lead you to! Trust me, you will never\
  \ expect what you will run into."
