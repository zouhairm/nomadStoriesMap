Text: "It\u2019s an expensive tour and I\u2019m late to see Nazca Lines. Where is\
  \ my taxi?\n\nI\u2019ve already asked the receptionist of the hotel who sold it\
  \ to me where the \u201Ctrustworthy\u201D taxi is. \u201CIt\u2019s almost arriving.\
  \ He\u2019s late, but you\u2019ll get your bus from Ica to Nazca in time, don\u2019\
  t worry\u201D, he said.\n\nLong minutes later, it finally arrived. The driver was\
  \ nice to me and apologized. I sat in the back of the car on the opposite side of\
  \ the driver, and we went to the bus terminal. But Peruvian traffic has its own\
  \ surprises. The adventure of that day was about to happen, Nazca Lines would be\
  \ secondary.\n\nImagine a big avenue with two main lanes, one for each direction.\
  \ In the middle of them, there was a big space with trees and in some spots you\
  \ could cross from one side to the other.\n\nThe traffic was intense. The driver\
  \ crossed to the central part of the avenue, where there were also many other cars\
  \ and tuctucs, a 3-wheels vehicle. The taxi driver was turning to get to the other\
  \ side of the avenue, but a mototaxi was doing the same and they crashed!\n\nThe\
  \ tuctuc driver got very angry, he jumped out of the mototaxi and went into our\
  \ direction. But the taxi driver accelerated and escaped! \n\nI thought the taxi\
  \ driver was crazy. He\u2019s running away! He probably thought, \u201CI have a\
  \ car, he\u2019s just a mototaxi. He won\u2019t be able to catch me\u201D. But the\
  \ tuctuc driver was angry and the traffic wasn\u2019t good. Suddenly the mototaxi\
  \ appeared from our right, in high speed, passed us and thrown his tuctuc in front\
  \ of our car.\n\nIt can always be worse. The taxi driver hit the mototaxi again!\
  \ He didn\u2019t stop as fast as needed and crashed at the back of the tuctuc. I\
  \ was asking myself, did he hit the same car twice? He\u2019s kidding me! No way!\n\
  \nThe tuctuc driver that was already mad now got insane. I was scared. Nevertheless,\
  \ my taxi driver was very calm, smiling, like nothing was happening, in a \u201C\
  don\u2019t worry, be happy\u201D state. He seemed to be acting like he was superior\
  \ and nothing could get him, it was strange.\n\nThe mototaxi driver came to the\
  \ taxi driver window and at this time he opened the window and they started to \u201C\
  talk\u201D.\n\nThe tuctuc driver was hitting with both hands on the door of the\
  \ car. I\u2019m not kidding, he was hitting hard! Hit, hit, hit and while hitting\
  \ the door he said something like:\n\n\u201CYou hit my car twice!!! Twice!!! You\
  \ hit it!! You hit it!! Are you crazy? Do you know how to drive? You\u2019ll pay!!!!\u201D\
  \n\nSuddenly he asked:\n\n\u201CGive me your license and your ID!!\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ taxi driver calmly opened the glove compartment and gave him just his business\
  \ card. Funny man.\n\n\u201CWhere is your driver\u2019s license?!?!?!?!\u201D\n\n\
  The driver answered: \u201CI don\u2019t have one.\u201D\n\nWhaaaaattttt??? I\u2019\
  m in a taxi that the driver doesn\u2019t even have a license!?!?\n\nYou can imagine\
  \ how angry the tuctuc driver got. But then, another movie like coincidence happened.\
  \ A police car was just passing by and when the mototaxi saw it, he almost jumped\
  \ in front of the car to stop it and ask for help.\n\nThen I thought, ok, no more\
  \ Nazca Lines today, we are really in trouble right now.\n\nThe police came to talk.\
  \ To my surprise, the taxi driver said he was taking me to the bus station that\
  \ was very near there and that I was late to get the bus.\n\nThe police officer\
  \ looked and said, \u201COk. You can take him to the bus terminal, but I\u2019m\
  \ going with you.\u201D\n\nHe entered the car and we got to my destination. The\
  \ taxi driver calmly explained to me how to get the bus and also said that everything\
  \ was ok. I answered him back with \u201CCuidate\u201D, an expression that I\u2019\
  ve heard from Peruvians many times in this travel, something like beware, take care\
  \ of yourself. I\u2019ve no idea what happened after that. I just know that I got\
  \ the bus on time and saw Nazca Lines some hours later. \n\nCuidate."
