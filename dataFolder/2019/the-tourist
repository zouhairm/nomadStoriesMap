Text: "Central and south America has been a very desirable destination for me: an\
  \ Eastern European with fearful expectations for the worst to happen ( traces of\
  \ that USSR closed system); thankfully I spent enough time in USA to rewire my inner\
  \ system of perception. Altogether my interest to travel to that side of the globe\
  \ evolved mainly around internet searches that replicated colorful images of Costa\
  \ Rica beaches, zesty picture of Peruvian food that would inspire another search\
  \ to a  highly rated Peruvian restaurant nearby my zip code. While I enjoyed all\
  \ the sauces (\u201C today\u2019s las cremas\u201D) and seasonings of Latin food,\
  \ I lacked some travel seasoning of my on exploring spirit. \n    I had pondered\
  \ the risks of a short visit to Guatemala for the entire time I rode the train to\
  \ the airport (35 min). Internet was abundant in articles that would cut off my\
  \ desire to even step out of the USA with a destination such as Guatemala. That\
  \ was an unique momentum when temptation won, and I had submerged into almost trance\
  \ like state: from the landing in Guat city to that throbbing grand entrance into\
  \ Antigua,  my alertness lowered its volume to a minimum. Instead, my mind went\
  \ on quest to find anything that resembles that yellow arch ( Arco De Santa Catalina)\
  \ because a tourist gotta take pictures\u2026\n    How ignorant of me, right?! \
  \ I should know better that once walking those paved streets, climbing the ruins\
  \ of Museo del Santo Pedro, sipping on local coffee in Plaza Central, inhaling that\
  \ air infused with aromas from the street food, I would be baptized into a new form\
  \ of exploring. That subtle desire to blend in with the locals when dinning at a\
  \ hacienda with a spectacular rooftop embellished with backpackers\u2019 tents,\
  \ or when taking a break in Plaza Central to watch that functional mixture of backpackers,\
  \ Canadian tourists and locals coexist. I became a part of that scenery as  natural\
  \ as it should happen with an organism that filters new elements and accepts those\
  \ who are somewhat familiar\n    The notion of time stopped existing to some extent:\
  \ while trying to get more out of daylight\u2019 s value, as the sunset gets consumed\
  \ in between a unique volcanic view, a new scenery unfolds. When the streetlights\
  \ cease to be as abundant as any westerner is used to consider \u201Dnormal\u201D\
  , or \u201Dsafe\u201D, local police force doubles noticeable. The town is not touristically\
  \ romantic in its medieval flare, or religiously austere as in 1200\u2019; it becomes\
  \ post civil war city. I recognized that shadow of fear imprinted on an 8-year-old\
  \ girl, local merchant of bracelets who showcased such sales tenacity( even though\
  \ in Spanish) I ran out of my \u201Dno gracias\u201D. As she walked away right on\
  \ to a next customer, I put on my black bead bracelet with a roman helmet as the\
  \ center piece, and asked myself if it would have looked better with the palm tree\
  \ center piece: that\u2019s what she said it was, she\u2019s never seen palm trees\
  \ or a cannabis leaf. I went to the hostel that night with that one souvenir on\
  \ my hands: I have replaced my luggage on rollers with a small backpack. It fits\
  \ me. \n   \n\nSilvia, Jan 24th 2019"
