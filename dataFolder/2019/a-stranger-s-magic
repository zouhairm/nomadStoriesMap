Text: "My mind was so preoccupied with how to make my last night with Zoe special\
  \ that I\u2019d forgotten my precious ear buds back in the hotel. Without my tiny\
  \ shields protecting me from human interaction, I felt rather vulnerable while riding\
  \ the metro this morning. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m afraid to chat with strangers,\
  \ but there is a good reason this city is nicknamed \u201CHollyweird.\u201D  \n\n\
  Before my anxiety could even set in, a local with a slick, silver ponytail and kind\
  \ eyes immediately plopped down in the seat next to me. He wore a pinstriped suit\
  \ several sizes too big and introduced himself as Max. He was also eager to discuss\
  \ last night\u2019s Lakers game, so I obliged. Though it ended up being more me\
  \ politely nodding my head to the rhythm of his ranting than a conversation at first,\
  \ our topic somehow shifted from basketball to love in which Max offered the following\
  \ words of wisdom: \u201CIf you really want to impress this girl, you should take\
  \ her to a magic show.\u201D Turns out Max was performing that night at the infamous\
  \ Magic Castle and offered me a coveted invitation to their exclusive clubhouse.\
  \ \n\nThe striking, white Victorian-era French chateau looked out of place nestled\
  \ on a hill overlooking the busiest intersection in Los Angeles. The gridlock was\
  \ worse than ever tonight but for once, inching one kilometer in thirty minutes\
  \ didn\u2019t bother me. Sure, my sweat was uncomfortably seeping through the snug\
  \ designer suit I\u2019d rented just for this occasion but I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ smiling. After all, I was on my way to a \u201Cmagic castle\u201D with the girl\
  \ of my dreams.\n\nThe walk along the red carpet out front was movie-premiere-worthy\
  \ as we served as our own paparazzi, trying to capture the perfect selfie like our\
  \ social media lives depended on it. Upon entering, we were led straight to an antiquated,\
  \ mahogany bookcase filled with hundreds of books, intricately arranged like a completed\
  \ Tetris grid. A monstrous, bronze owl stood perched on the middle shelf as a gatekeeper\
  \ to this palace of mystery and intrigue. Its beady, ruby gaze sharply contrasted\
  \ with Zoe\u2019s sapphire eyes as I leaned toward her while whispering the password\
  \ into the winged beast\u2019s ear. As the aged wood groaned, the cabinet slowly\
  \ parted to reveal a hidden passage into the castle.\n\nIt was as if we\u2019d stumbled\
  \ through a portal to another era, with infectious 1920\u2019s jazz roaring and\
  \ the sweet scent of old perfume in the air. Blanketed by walls of maroon and burgundy,\
  \ there were enough ornate chandeliers and velvet curtains to fill twenty homes.\
  \ We wandered into a room where an intimate crowd gathered around a self-playing\
  \ piano, hammering out a version of \u201CLet It Be.\u201D The haunted piano would\
  \ continue to take song requests all night long from the rowdy guests.\n\nIt was\
  \ only fitting the last show of the evening starred Max and he certainly knew how\
  \ to make an entrance. An enormous, golden mirror rose from the floor of the stage\
  \ to the soundtrack of an ever-increasing thunderous drumbeat. Inside the mirror\
  \ stood Max, grinning in the same over-sized suit I\u2019d met him in. As a veil\
  \ of smoke saturated the stage, Max\u2019s reflection began to emerge out of the\
  \ mirror. It was both terrifying and captivating all at once but all that mattered\
  \ was Zoe was delighted by it all.\n\nFor his final act, Max needed a volunteer\
  \ so naturally, I raised Zoe\u2019s hand for her. Upon bringing Zoe onstage, he\
  \ asked her to proclaim her favourite playing card. He then unsheathed a long, thin\
  \ sword and handed her a deck of cards. Instructing her to throw the deck high up\
  \ into the air, he stabbed at the flourish of cards raining down and pierced the\
  \ sword through a lone card in one quick thrust. Revealing the spiked card to be\
  \ the one she\u2019d just uttered, Zoe shrieked in astonishment and ran off the\
  \ stage into my arms. \n\nI had never been anywhere so whimsical and charming. Sadly,\
  \ Zoe would go on to vanish from my life but thanks to Max, I will forever remember\
  \ the night when the magic was real."
