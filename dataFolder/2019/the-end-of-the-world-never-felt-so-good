Text: "How can I start writing when I still can\u2019t find the words to describe\
  \ what I felt in Ushuaia, the city of the end of the world? \nAs the plane was getting\
  \ closer to the city, I wasn\u2019t able to take my eyes off the window, I couldn\u2019\
  t believe what I was seeing. I still don\u2019t. And when I landed and I was stepping\
  \ on earth, my fascination began to grow more and more with every minute that passed.\
  \ \n\nThe Andes mountains seemed to be touching the sky, and I felt so little, that\
  \ I asked myself: why do people care so much about things that are not that important?\
  \ We, as human beings, are so fragile and from one day to another we can not exist\
  \ anymore. At the same time I was trying to believe what I was seeing, I was trying\
  \ to put in my brain the fact that those breathtaking mountains and stunning lakes\
  \ were true and part of our world. And for a moment I imagined that if I lived in\
  \ a tent in the middle of one of those mountains, I would be the happiest person\
  \ in the planet.\n\nBefore my arrival I had studied a part of Ushuaia\u2019s history\
  \ and if I thought that it was unbelievable that people went there all alone to\
  \ find hostile natives, in a time when there was no ways of communicating or even\
  \ people who spoke your own language, imagine how big my wonder was when I looked\
  \ at that isolated lands. I felt so brave for going that far by myself, and when\
  \ I remembered those facts, for a moment I felt like a coward.\nI can promise that\
  \ when I was enjoying the landscapes, hiking, drinking hot chocolate on my favorite\
  \ tea house, or drinking \u2018mates\u2019, the best Argentinian drink, on the shore\
  \ of the Beagle channel, I truly wanted every single person I love to be there with\
  \ me to enjoy that, no matter what I was doing. Everything was so beautiful that\
  \ I felt selfish for enjoying all of that alone.\n\nThe day before I took my flight\
  \ to come back home I climbed a hill. I sat at its top for half and hour and while\
  \ I looked at the mountains and the city from above, I wanted to cry. I spent every\
  \ minute thinking how lucky I was to be able to enjoy that views, and how lucky\
  \ I was to realize that I enjoy my own company a lot more than I thought I would,\
  \ because I know that most people feel sad when they\u2019re all by themselves.\
  \ But at that place, surrounded by forests and the highest peaks I have ever seen\
  \ in my life, I loved my loneliness and I started to feel proud of how brave I was.\n\
  \nThe last day I woke up very early and as the taxi was taking me to the airport,\
  \ I saw the Andes mountains covered in snow. I spent a month in the city and that\
  \ was the first and only time I saw them like that, and I couldn\u2019t stop smiling\
  \ because I liked (and still like) to think that it was Ushuaia\u2019s way to say\
  \ goodbye to me. \n\nWith my heart broken in a million pieces I got on the plane,\
  \ and I spent the three hours that separated me from home thinking that, from all\
  \ of the places in the entire world, I fell in love with the uttermost part of earth.\
  \ And in that moment I realized that The End of the World was, indeed, the beginning\
  \ of everything for me."
