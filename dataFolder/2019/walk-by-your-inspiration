Text: "After travelling by bike, for almost one year, through eastern Europe, been\
  \ in Greece, I decided that was time to return home, back to Catalunya. Again, by\
  \ bike. So, my trip started on a cold, short-day, winter coming, October. I was\
  \ setting my tent at 6pm, because light was already gone and warm ending! And at\
  \ 6 in the morning I was already tired of waiting inside my little one-woman-tent.\
  \ \nSo, after couple of days, I enter an unknown country for me, by then, called\
  \ Makedonija in the road pannels. And a new deep adventure began there.\n\nI woke\
  \ up the first day, my tent fixed next to a school, where some locals spent the\
  \ night talking. Went to the only open shop I found, and draw a bread in a paper,\
  \ in order to ask for one. With this interaction, I learnt my first macedonian words:\
  \ \"Zdravo\" (hi), \"Fala\" (thanks).\nI kept cycling, finally getting to Skopje,\
  \ the capital, after fighting for finding a path a part from the motorway.\n\nThe\
  \ turkish area seemed exotic and caotic to me. Beautiful. \nAsked a local group\
  \ of students for a library. Which brought me to the new center. A extreme strange\
  \ contrast. With immense white building and statues.\nI managed to get a computer\
  \ with internet connection there. Search for a social center on town, and found\
  \ it! Wrote down the adress on a paper with a croquis of the street map. And with\
  \ this information, took my bike and went to look for it!\nOnce there, after asking\
  \ some locals for the exact location, the ones who where organizing the event of\
  \ the day, looked at me with surprising expectation. \"How did you arrived here?!\"\
  \ Even the locals where unable to find it and having troubles getting there! And\
  \ me, with my bike, was there, simple, coming from Catalunya?!? \nI discovered that\
  \ that was the inauguration of the first selforganized autonomus cultural social\
  \ center on the country!!! And I was there!\n\nThat was the beginning of four months\
  \ living with the community of activists and artists. Exploring by the streets,\
  \ markets, and nature. Discovering their culture through them. With them. Sharing\
  \ our lives and love.\nIt become my second home."
