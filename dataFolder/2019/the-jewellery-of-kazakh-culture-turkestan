  I went  here with purpose: combine pleasure with benefit. Because I participated\
  \ in International Olympiad which took place in Kozha Akhmet Yassaui University.\
  \ But unfortunately, I did not won any place and I did not regret about it. Because\
  \ I had a lot of recollections about this trip with my lovely mom! Let\u2019s go\
  \ further !There I had written about Turkisran and what did I do in this historical,warm\
  \ city!\nI.We went to Almaty and there took the bus to Turkistan, I was really surprised\
  \ when heard price of ticket, it was cost only 2000 tg. Moreover, we got there in\
  \ 7 hours: we arrived to Turkistan at 5 p.m. And there was raining, my mom suggested\
  \ to took a taxi to our hotel because we were there first time and we did not know\
  \ a  locality of this city. It was cost about 500 tenge.\nII.My mom booked a twin\
  \ room ( with 2 beds ) in the hotel \u201CYASSY\u201D for 6500 tenge. This hotel\
  \ was for foreigners: I has seen French, British, Turkish tourists  and we were\
  \ wondered that it was cost not expensive. About a hotel: it was very clean, but\
  \ not warm when we had arrived in, there were 2 beds, one chest of drawers and locker\
  \ ,TV, one mini fridge, shower, two towels and etc. I had arrived sleepy to hotel\
  \ and did not worried about the room.We had a shower and went to bed.In bus it was\
  \ not possible to sleep with the crowd of people who was talking, making a noise\
  \ or have interrupt my thoughts during the road.Initially, we did not know that\
  \ this hotel located near Kozha  Akhmet  Yassaui  mausoleum  and recognized when\
  \ we had a breakfast at that day when we arrived: we were waiting our meal and I\
  \ just opened the curtains of windows and saw this mausoleum. Mom ordered the Turkish\
  \ breakfast and i ordered the American breakfast.Both of them were delicious.After\
  \ breakfast we went on foot there to visit Kozha  Akhmet  Yassaui mausoleum.\nIII.\
  \ The ticket\u2019s prize for entering was for adult\u2019s 500 tg and school students\
  \ 300 tg.This mausoleum was very huge size. In mausoleum I saw tourists from Vietnam\
  \ and Korea. I really felt that I entered to my nation\u2019s history which I cherish.\
  \ We was in small shops where were sold knuck-knackeries which some of them we sold\
  \ for our relatives in Taldykorgan.\nIV. After sightseeing the statues of historic\
  \ persons, we felt ourselves hungry and visited one good place \u201CKeruen saray\u201D\
  . We were recommended by a stranger to visit this restaurant  for cheap barbecues\
  \ and meals. As we come in there was a cosy atmosphere for having lunch and dinner.The\
  \ territory was spacious and noticed that it is the most popular place for tourists\
  \ as we. After some time, we ordered barbecues and lagman. There was one minus:\
  \ waiters did not approach us immediately.\nV. After lunch, we went on foot to our\
  \ hotel and along the way, we did shopping and walked. Because of cheap prices this\
  \ trip was so affordable for our budget:I bought a watch for remember this exciting\
  \ trip.\nVI. The next day I went to university to participate for Olympiad. When\
  \ it had started I did not expect that they would give not easy tasks for schoolchildren.\
  \ I had spent my time for visit a library, halls, canteen, dormitory and etc.\n\
  VII. We came back by train and price of tickets were 6000 tg.(12 hours)\n\n My \
  \ trip  to Turkistan  with my mom lasted for 2 days and was impeccable for me!\n\
  I have warm recollections about this city.Because people are very kind and likes\
  \ to help with any problem:they wanted us to have a good trip. I invite and recommend\
  \  you to visit your historical cities or places because it is your history which\
  \ will always connect you with your culture. So put your responsibilities and missions\
  \ in life on ice and travel. After all, people will became open minded and satisfied\
  \ with their life:not necessary to go abroad, be interested in other cities in your\
  \ country, any city has its specific diversity of taste,people,weather,culture!"
