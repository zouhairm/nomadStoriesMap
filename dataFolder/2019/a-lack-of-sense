Text: "\u201CFree?\u201D I say, stupidly for the second time. \n\u201CYes,\u201D the\
  \ man at the entrance booth to the Pinchuk Art Centre replies. \nHis voice has a\
  \ thick accent which to my dull untrained ears sounds Russian, but more likely he\
  \ is Ukrainian.  \nI\u2019ve been waiting outside in a line for almost an hour as\
  \ a light rain falls from the overcast sky above Kiev. My experience of lines in\
  \ Europe has taught me that at the end of every line, is another opportunity to\
  \ part with some of my hard-earned money, I gained in the mines of retail labour.\n\
  I walk around the gallery stopping first, because his is a name I recognize, to\
  \ look at a piece of lego art made by Ai Weiwei. Then I look at some more interesting\
  \ pieces of art by creators whose names I don\u2019t know, but who\u2019s art I\
  \ appreciate even without a name attached to it.\nEventually I find my way up the\
  \ white steps to the third floor of the gallery where a special exhibition is taking\
  \ place. I see a line up so I know it has to be good. I wait in line clutching Ukrainian\
  \ Hryvnia  in my hand, ready to give money for whatever I am waiting for. Twenty\
  \ minutes later and they once again don\u2019t want my money. A redheaded Ukrainian\
  \ with a prettier nose than mine guides myself and a girl into the next room where\
  \ she explains to us that blindfolds will be put on us as well as noise-cancelling\
  \ headphones, then she will lead us by hand to another room were other guest equally\
  \ deprived of their senses will be wandering around. She says to walk carefully\
  \ with our hands stretched out, and that when we make contact with someone we can\
  \ shake hands, hug, or even dance. Finally she adds that when we want to leave,\
  \ we simply hold our hand up into the air and someone will guide us out. She leads\
  \ me in by the hand and then let me go to the silent darkness. \nI walk around carefully\
  \ for about a minute before my fingers brush up against a hand, which I awkwardly\
  \ shook. My next contact was more direct, we meet and exchange a friendly and anonymous\
  \ hug, the go our separate ways. My third interaction starts the same as the other\
  \ two, with fingers colliding in the air, but was different from that moment on.\
  \ Our hands squeeze each other\u2019s warmly and we hug. It was a long close hug,\
  \ somehow more intimate than any romantic encounter I had experienced in years.\
  \ I felt such warmth and and love from this complete stranger in our hug. It made\
  \ me feel better about the world knowing that such. pure faceless love can be expressed\
  \ between two complete strangers. No words necessary, no visuals required, just\
  \ pure human touch. Our hug eventually ends, we hold hands again and begin to dance\
  \ silently, blindly. After a while our dance gently collides with another person,\
  \ and I grab that person\u2019s hand and guide it to my anonymous friend, and I\
  \ let go of them both as they for all intents and purposes disappear from my world,\
  \ perhaps dancing away together. \nA few moments later I hold up my hand  and someone\
  \ guides me out of the room. I take off my blindfold and headphones. It  is a startling\
  \ feeling regaining my senses. I look around at some other people who have also\
  \ just come out. There is a beautiful dark haired women, I smile at her and wonder\
  \ if it was her I had connected so much with. I rest on the thought , but have no\
  \ way of knowing for sure. I could ask her, but why spoil such a good time with\
  \ the harshness of light and the illumination of reality? I smile to myself, leave\
  \ the building and go back out onto the rainy streets of Kiev."
