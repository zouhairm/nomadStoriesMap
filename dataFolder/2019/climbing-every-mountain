Text: "Travelling by yourself is many things. It's fun, challenging, exciting and\
  \ above all, it's liberating! From wandering the wilds of the Yorkshire dales to\
  \ the crumbling, ancient grandeur of the Alhambra, I've always enjoyed finding the\
  \ path less travelled - although I'm not averse to finding the cutest cafes along\
  \ the way! And hiking through France's gorgeous Alsace wine region under the blue\
  \ skies of a French summer absolutely delivered the goods. \n\nMy journey started\
  \ from Colmar, a small town in the midst of the sprawling vineyards of a region\
  \ whose Riesling's are the toast of the European continent. However, it could have\
  \ started differently as I forgot to check the bus timetables! But when one door\
  \ closes, another opens, and I was determined not to waste a gorgeous summer's day\
  \ in Alsace, so I walked the picturesque four kilometres between Colmar and Eguisheim\
  \ under sapphire blue skies and through cornfields that looked straight out of a\
  \ Van Gogh watercolour. All I can say is thank goodness for spontaneous decisions!\
  \ I was absolutely enthralled by the vibrant colours and sun-dappled houses of Eguisheim\
  \ - one of France's famous 'Villes Fleuries,' or flower towns - which, despite having\
  \ been designated one of the country's most beautiful towns in 2013, I can definitely\
  \ say is one of France's best kept secrets.\n\nWalking into Eguisheim, the first\
  \ thing you notice is the immaculate flower beds that line every window sill and\
  \ every garden. The crimson tulips and dazzling purple pansies practically burst\
  \ onto the narrow cobbled streets, giving the entire town a delightfully whimsical\
  \ aura that is only surpassed by the fairytale houses that huddle together on every\
  \ street corner. I was in awe of the tapestry of colours and birdsong in the town\
  \ square, with the ancient fountain and cathedral standing watch over the sleepy\
  \ cafes below. If you're lucky you can spot the resident storks that perch their\
  \ nest precariously on the very tip of the church's spire - a wonderful photo opportunity\
  \ for tourists and locals alike. However, for the more adventurous, Eguisheim offers\
  \ other hidden marvels - just a short hike away lies a sprawling mountain ridge\
  \ which offers the most commanding views of the valley below. The path is easy to\
  \ miss, but once I had begun the often arduous hike through silent woodlands and\
  \ rocky outcrops reminiscent of Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth I knew that I had found\
  \ something truly special. The locals will tell you that the ruins atop the ridge\
  \ are worth seeing, but my first view over the mountainside gave me the most breathtaking\
  \ views of my entire trip! Apart from taking the photo opportunity (of course),\
  \ I took a moment to savour the luscious greenery of this secluded little wine valley\
  \ and marvel at just how well Alsace's natural wonders have been preserved. \n\n\
  But of course, all this hiking requires refreshment, and you need look no further\
  \ than Caveau Heuhaus, a delightful restaurant tucked away below ground just off\
  \ the town square. I found the traditional tarte flambee, a sort of French pizza,\
  \ is a surefire way to quell your hunger after a long day of walking, as is the\
  \ house Riesling! Every restaurant and cafe here oozes traditional Alsatian charm,\
  \ with chequered tablecloths and walls crowded with trophies and copper pans sure\
  \ to add a distinctly Franco-German charm to any meal. Leaving after my hearty meal\
  \ was truly a bittersweet moment, but I know for certain that I will be back to\
  \ savour the sights, sounds and flavours of Eguisheim for years to come!\n\nIt's\
  \ not every day that you find climbing every mountain actually does help you find\
  \ a dream - but if that's your cup of tea, Eguisheim in summer is the place to be."
