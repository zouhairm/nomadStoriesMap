Text: "Your ass is hanging out the bottom of your Levi\u2019s cut-offs, and try as\
  \ you might your scooter just won\u2019t start outside Caf\xE9 Organic. It\u2019\
  s hard to feel cool in Canggu. More so when the cracked pleather of the seat is\
  \ scorching lame-girl identification tattoos on your buns.\n\nThere\u2019s something\
  \ douchey about the Instagram culture that\u2019s rapidly colonising this laid-back\
  \ town. But the not-so-candid shots make it enticing, and I want in. \n\nI should\
  \ first let it be known that I am far from anything that defines a modern day cool\
  \ girl. I get too lit at parties and my Birkin-Bangs shrivel up when I enter the\
  \ water. I clapped at Pretty Poison before congratulating some dude on his drop\
  \ in. \n\nEven perched on top of Crate Caf\xE9 with my Ray-Bans and smoothie bowl,\
  \ spinning my latest yarn while trying to hold a conversation with James, 30, the\
  \ surfing magazine editor, I was a faker.\n\nHaving been a ballsy Sunshine Beach\
  \ surfer in my prepubescent years, I thought I would try my luck at finding my fame\
  \ in the plastic-lined waters of Batu Bolong Beach. I ended up in a slightly vocal\
  \ altercation with the mellow local from the board hire shack.\n\n\u201CHow good\
  \ you surf?\u201D\n\u201CUh, beginner. Kind of.\u201D\n\u201CBeginner? You take\
  \ blue board.\u201D\n\u201CNo, it\u2019s okay. I will be fine with the other boards.\u201D\
  \n\u201CNo. Beginner. You take blue board.\u201D\n\nI accepted my lun-grammable\
  \ state, reasoning that the likelihood of crashing into one of my latest long haired\
  \ tinder matches was slim. It wasn\u2019t, and Reuben, 22, in Bali for the weekend\
  \ had a great laugh as my shaggy-cool fringe plastered my face and my blue foamy\
  \ skyrocketed for the sixth time that hour.\n\nAdmitting my defeat, I retired to\
  \ the safer and more palatable waters of Old Man\u2019s for some vegan nachos and\
  \ the dulcet tones of Top 40 bangers reminding me how much easier faking cool-girl\
  \ status was at home.\n\ni ended up at Gimme Shelter, a local rock bar down some\
  \ other edgy back lane. It had just opened, and wasn\u2019t too infested with Australian\u2019\
  s yet. Smoking inside was cool and the unisex bathrooms even cooler.\n\nA week on\
  \ and still no sudden fame, I was testing the waters for another way of boosting\
  \ the social media statistics. I opted for a free tattoo with taco deal. How cool,\
  \ edgy and spontaneous of me; I went out for dinner and came back with a tattoo\
  \ of the moon and the sun. The followers didn\u2019t need to know that I might have\
  \ quite possibly just contracted HIV. The 156 likes were worth it. \n\nDetermined\
  \ to make one final impact on the town, we threw a house party. A little bit of\
  \ ritalin washed down with a glass of extrajoss later, I lay on the kitchen bench\
  \ befriending Randall, the gecko on the ceiling, moving only to put on my Pretty\
  \ Poison souvenir tee when the tropical thunderstorm outside eventually started\
  \ to get a little chilly.\n\n//\n\nBali Belly got me big time, and I lost 5kg. Vomiting\
  \ light gluten beer and Nasi Goreng for a few days on end got me down. More concerned\
  \ with my health than the high-waisted bikini and coconut instagrams, I figured\
  \ I wasn\u2019t cut out for this un-pragmatic interpretation of fame.\n\nYet, with\
  \ total disregard of this apparition and in one final attempt to look effortless\
  \ I spoke in Indonesian super casually, wherever possible, to show how integrated\
  \ into society I was. For some reason, terima kasih didn\u2019t quite roll off the\
  \ tongue and upon leaving Deus on the back of a scooter I smiled and waved at the\
  \ friendly security, and shouted terimisi as I rode off into the distance.\n\nTaking\
  \ advice from James, 30, surfing magazine editor, I checked out the property section\
  \ of Canggu Weekly over a coconut-milk iced mocha in a mason jar. \n\n\u201CIf you\u2019\
  re looking to invest in property maybe try the next town over. It\u2019s up and\
  \ coming.\u201D"
