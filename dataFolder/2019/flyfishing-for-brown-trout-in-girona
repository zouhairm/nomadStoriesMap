Text: "After a frustrating morning of casting with long leaders, 6x tippet and tiny\
  \ nymphs, my Spanish fly-fishing guide decided to take me to stretch of river with\
  \ bigger fish. In the relaxed, Spanish way we decided to have lunch first. We had\
  \ some traditional country food, butifarra (Spanish pork boerewors) and patatas\
  \ bravas (grilled potatoes). This dish surprised me, I thought we invented boerewors\
  \ and they even gave it a cooler name!\nTime to get back to the river! We parked\
  \ in a random field and I followed my guide to a spot that produced a big Rainbow\
  \ Trout. This got me excited! He pointed out a deep run and explained a cast to\
  \ get my flies into position. I made a sloppy, yet effective cast and the flies\
  \ drifted through the run. The indicator stopped and I was on! My line slowly moved\
  \ off the guide asked me if it felt big and I replied with uncertainty. The next\
  \ moment the fish bolted upstream and ended up in vegetation against the bank, an\
  \ opportunity lost\u2026\nThe guide lifted the leader and to our surprise the fish\
  \ bolted out under the vegetation! I started running like mad man after the fish\
  \ which stopped behind a big boulder and I gained control. I calmly lifted the fish\u2019\
  s head towards the net and the fight was over! My guide congratulated me with a\
  \ crazy shoulder hit/grab/shake and said: \u201Clucky fish, strong tippet!\u201D\
  \ Lucky indeed!"
