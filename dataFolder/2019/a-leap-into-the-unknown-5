Text: "\u2018The French Riviera of the East\u2019 \u2013 as you make your way into\
  \ Pondicherry (Pondy), you see the architecture weaved around the reminiscence of\
  \ the French colonial rule and culture that makes you quickly realise about why\
  \ this place is called French of the east. \nImpression of the French colonial rule\
  \ and dirt-cheap alcohol, pristine beaches and the French colourful architectural\
  \ colonies, that is my introduction for one of India\u2019s most beautiful Union\
  \ Territories \u2013 Pondicherry. Yes, the major advantage of all booze lovers to\
  \ visit any Union Territory in India is cheap alcohol. \nI boarded an early morning\
  \ flight from Mumbai to Chennai and boarded a Tamilnadu Road Transport Service bus\
  \ to reach this Union Territory form Chennai. I reached Pondicherry in almost four\
  \ hours. The scenic roads make for beautiful scenery to Pondy. \nPondicherry was\
  \ a part of my itinerary for a long time because of the famous Auroville City- built\
  \ by a famous literary figure of India, Aurobindo Ghosh. On the very first morning\
  \ I headed to Auroville, which requires and deserves a longer trip and a wider time\
  \ span.  Though my major aim was to explore Pondy, see its famous spots and bite\
  \ into some French Food! I visited some popular tourist spots like, the Beach Road\
  \ (Promenade) where I stayed, the Gandhi Statue (On the Beach Road), Raj Niwas (Also\
  \ called, Palais Du Gouvernement), Botanical Garden and Shri Aurobindo Ashram.\n\
  However, the highlight of my trip to this wonderland on the East Coast was my visit\
  \ to Paradise Beach and Auroville.  Located eight kms away from Pondy, towards the\
  \ Cuddalore Main Road in Chunnambar, this has a Boat Service to the beach in the\
  \ evening. This place can only be accessed by boat, though residents know the road\
  \ rout. Auroville is the place, which gives you the goal for second inning of your\
  \ life. One certainly feels to spend the old age here. But the volunteers here say\
  \ that one should spend the youth here and contribute to the place as a volunteer.\
  \ A very quite and green place has a temple looking like a glob. An Amphitheatre\
  \ adjoining to the temple was one thing that I loved the most in Auroville. The\
  \ glob temple is yet another beauty of the city. The complete place has white marble\
  \ fittings and a big meditation hall. While heading back from the Auroville, rather\
  \ heading to center Pondy I headed straight opposite. There is one Aurobindo beach\
  \ that is worth a visit heading opposite to the Auroville. Here there\u2019s no\
  \ shacks and food joints. If you are a nature lover and have a poet in you this\
  \ beach is perfect for you. A walk along the beach with the shells touching your\
  \ feet transports you to the wonderland of your imaginations. \nWhen you reach the\
  \ Aurobindo beach, you actually realize why it is the dreamland \u2013 Blue waters\
  \ and Golden sand with shells on the shore. I never thought an Indian beach had\
  \ blue waters. I felt that pollution had killed our seas and grey or mud melt brown\
  \ was the only colour that our waters showed. It\u2019s a virgin island. Not just\
  \ on a weekday, but it seems that there are a very few people go on this beach.\
  \ The view of the immaculate tides impending from the Bay of Bengal, it literally\
  \ felt like the Ameesha Patel of Kaho Na Pyaar Hai, (Though in my case Hrithik was\
  \ missing to make the scene perfect).\nDuring the evenings, I strolled around the\
  \ town trying to explore and experiment with the food. For a place having a French\
  \ feel, there were plenty of French Food Cafe\u2019s out there. I chose Le Caf\xE9\
  . Though being a North Indian, on the third day on my trip I longed for North Indian\
  \ food and was badly looking for some daal-chawal or sabzi-chapati. It didn\u2019\
  t take long to explore that too. There is Delhi Darbar \u2013 a dining place fore\
  \ North Indians. I had Daal Makhni with Naan and Mix vegetable and curd rice. Delhi\
  \ Darbar secured a great place in my tummy that next afternoon again I headed to\
  \ the same place for Biryani and Raita before bidding the bye to this amazingly\
  \ beautiful city."
