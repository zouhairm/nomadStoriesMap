Text: "We were sitting around the dining room table, chatting after finishing a Christmas\
  \ Eve meal, a gathering of Lauren's closest friends in Singapore. \"Wait, you don't\
  \ actually live here?\" asked Riana, curious how I'd been invited to an intimate\
  \ holiday gathering on such short notice. \"No actually, I've lived in the US for\
  \ several years now, though I didn't meet Lauren there either. Have you ever been\
  \ to a Sheep Cafe?\"\n\nThree years ago, as I was wandering through Samcheongdong\
  \ in Seoul, I\u2019d heard a snippet of English in the midst of the melodious November\
  \ afternoon: \"one with soy sauce, please,\" preceding my glance in the general\
  \ direction of the sound.  While I was grateful for the opportunity to explore a\
  \ new city, I was, after all, spending the Thanksgiving holidays alone, and had\
  \ perked up at the sound of familiar language.\n\n \"Where have you been in Seoul?\"\
  \ Lauren asked, wondering why I'd decided to linger after receiving my skewer. Up\
  \ until that point, I\u2019d only seen some of the usual tourist sites, whereas\
  \ Lauren, as I discovered, hadn\u2019t had the opportunity to explore much of the\
  \ area. \"Did you always want to be involved in hospitality?\" I wondered, as we\
  \ walked through the Hanok-lined streets, admiring the curved, tiled roofs, and\
  \ the elegant wooden architecture of the houses. \"Actually, I've always wanted\
  \ to create once-in-a-lifetime experiences for others, to be part of their most\
  \ cherished memories. When I first started my career, I worked as a waitress in\
  \ a Michelin-starred restaurant in New York, then later transitioned to training\
  \ and consulting.\" Human connection had always been one of my core values - I was\
  \ intrigued, to say the least.\n\n\"Do you have any more time this afternoon, Lauren?\
  \ I heard there's a Sheep Cafe in Mapo, several districts over. I mean, it\u2019\
  s an almost crazy idea, to visit a cafe where you relax by interacting with sheep.\"\
  \ \n\nAs we settled in with our coffees, sheep warmly resting in their nearby pen\
  \ (the complete opposite to the vivacious onomatopoeia needed to communicate with\
  \ the college student we\u2019d asked for directions, who hadn\u2019t quite understood\
  \ us the first time), I decided to ask the question I'd been considering the entire\
  \ journey to the cafe:\n\n\"You've given me such a genuine view, an understanding\
  \ of why you live the life that you do, but I'm still curious, what were those experiences\
  \ that have broken you, that have made you the person you are today?\" Lauren paused\
  \ for a moment, taken aback, and replied that very few people, close friends or\
  \ otherwise, had ever asked her such a question. It turned out that the decisions\
  \ she'd made, the life she\u2019d led, had been shaped by a traumatic past, a past\
  \ of unsettling relationships and affection withheld. Spending the rest of the evening\
  \ sharing our personal histories, stories of significant others and childhood memories,\
  \ was such a heart-warming experience, especially in the company of city-dwelling,\
  \ cafe-lingering sheep. \n\n\"I'll leave you two to catch up,\" said Brandon, the\
  \ last of the dinner guests to leave. Clearing the remaining plates from the table,\
  \ I followed Lauren back to the otherwise empty kitchen, where the last of the Singaporean\
  \ craft beer remained. \"You know, I never would have imagined you'd be standing\
  \ here this many years later. If all you did that day was smile back when I did,\
  \ I'd have been happy.\"\n\n\"Well, do you want me to stay, tonight?\""
