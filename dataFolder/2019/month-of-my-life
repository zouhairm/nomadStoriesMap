Text: "I never travelled by air but it was my first and big thing was it was international\
  \ air travel that made me super excited and motivational towards for travel. I have\
  \ taken my flight which was turkish airlines to Atat\xFCrk airport \u0130stanbul.\
  \ My experience of turkish airline was super amazing because I never thought that\
  \ flight take off and landing could be that much smooth. Although I travelled so\
  \ many places in India but Turkey was my dream country. There were peace and love\
  \ in the air which made my every second memorable. I travelled 5 cities in turkey,\
  \ that were Istanbul, Karab\xFCk, ankara, amasara, bolu. And every city has their\
  \ own kind of beauty. Turkey is full of nature. Food was super yummy if you love\
  \ less salt and pepper food. And more than that people from Turkey are like most\
  \ humble and calm on the earth. I always thought how you can manage in a unknown\
  \ country but I found so much love. If I will talk about tourism turkey is full\
  \ of tourists places but if you really want to cover places in a less time then\
  \ invest your time in Istanbul, cappadocia, izmir and \xC7anakkale konya and bursa.\
  \ These are so beautiful places you will not get over of this beauty. Public transport\
  \ is so good that there is no any issue like if you are travelling alone or with\
  \ someone. You can take luxury buses like Mercedes or you take fary and air transport\
  \ too. Istanbul is little bit costly as comparatively to other cities but from shopping\
  \ side its a hub of all the things. Grand bazar and M\u0131s\u0131r \xE7ar\u015F\
  \u0131 and Istanbul mall and so many other places for shopping. I am in love for\
  \ their cafe because they are so beautiful and cozy and clean as well. Street food\
  \ is so yummy that you will never go in big restaurants. We had g\xF6zleme, d\xF6\
  ner, and pasta and kebab, iskandriya kebab. If you are coffee lover then go ahed\
  \ for turkish coffe and turkish tea as well. Their hospitality will take take your\
  \ heart. If you are really admire arctitechture then definitely check the turkish\
  \ architecture which is most important thing about turkey. I travelled in July that\
  \ was hottest weather actually but in that in the evening you will have to put on\
  \ somthing. Some times i don't realize but weather changes occur so quickly. Apart\
  \ from all of these things if you are a shopaholic then have a look on some sovereign\
  \ gift of turkey for your loved ones and turkish coffe cup are so beautiful. Their\
  \ mountains are so clean and safe for travel beaches are like so enjoyable that\
  \ you can live there like years. There are so many activities that happens time\
  \ to time near to these place that make your trip more memorable."
