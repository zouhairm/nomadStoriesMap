Text: "As a student, I studied foreign languages. That\u2019s why it was my big dream\
  \ to travel abroad. At the beginning of my university life, I was sure that studies\
  \ came first and I\u2019d travel only after getting a degree. But soon I realized\
  \ that I was wrong. Studies are undoubtedly very important, but there is a more\
  \ important thing, which is experience. \nBeing a very responsible person (sometimes\
  \ even too responsible), I like it when everything is planned very far in advance.\
  \ I\u2019m not that fond of surprises, or it\u2019s better to say I was. In the\
  \ third year of the university, I understood I needed changes. I wanted to do something\
  \ crazy. That\u2019s how my journey began.\nOn the first day of the winter term,\
  \ one person in our university group was absent. This person was me. Everybody was\
  \ surprised as I was the only person who didn\u2019t skip a single class during\
  \ the previous term. But it was impossible for me to come, because I had left to\
  \ Austria.\nThis travel was not that spontaneous of course. I had two months of\
  \ the thorough preparation to it. However, the decision to take it struck me like\
  \ a thunderbolt one fall day. My only goal then was to improve my German skills.\
  \ I failed this goal completely, but have never regretted it, because what I found\
  \ there was much more precious and important for me.\nI didn\u2019t expect to see\
  \ that there are much more similarities than differences between people all around\
  \ the globe. At school, we are told a lot about numerous differences, so that foreigners\
  \ seem to be real aliens, and that\u2019s how many dubious stereotypes and prejudices\
  \ are created. I felt really happy realizing that most of them were wrong. People\
  \ are much closer to each other than they seem to be, much kinder and eager to know\
  \ each other.\nI didn\u2019t expect to discover so many colors of the world. Every\
  \ single place on the Earth has its own history, its own memory. Being stuck in\
  \ a rut, we often pass them by. Perhaps that is the very reason why we need to travel.\
  \ To see these things more clearly.\nI didn\u2019t expect to answer so many of my\
  \ inner questions. As it was said by Henry Miller, \u201COne\u2019s destination\
  \ is never a place, but a new way of seeing things.\u201D It is very difficult to\
  \ argue these words. Travels have unique power to show something that has been hidden\
  \ from you for a long time and to make the most complicated things simple and obvious.\
  \ Due to my journey, I finally understood what is really important for me in this\
  \ life, what are my dreams and my goals. I\u2019m not afraid of taking risks anymore\
  \ because my journey showed me that everything is possible if you keep trying.\n\
  I didn\u2019t expect to find so many friends from all around the world. On my way\
  \ to Austria, I was sure that I would hardly meet anyone except Austrians. Can you\
  \ imagine how surprised I was to find out that Austria is a really international\
  \ country, and even in a small village, people from almost all the continents can\
  \ be found? It was very interesting to get to know each other, to see other cultures\
  \ and countries with its residents\u2019 eyes, to help and support each other.\n\
  I understand that my memories of this journey may sound too idealistic. Some travels\
  \ are not happy at all, and some of them can even hurt, hurt severely, but they\
  \ will definitely teach you, and these lessons may appear to be the most important\
  \ lessons of your life. You\u2019ll never know until you try it. So don\u2019t be\
  \ afraid, take risks and live your life."
