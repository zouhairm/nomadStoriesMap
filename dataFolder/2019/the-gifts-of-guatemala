Text: "I grew up in a family that loves to travel, backpack, run, and experience.\
  \ Experience for our family is a verb, not a noun. I started from a young age traveling\
  \ all over the US, Canada, and Mexico, and eventually went to Germany for the first\
  \ time at just 8 years old. I easily discovered my passions for travel quickly aligned\
  \ with that of my family. \nOne of my greatest adventures was a volunteer service\
  \ trip to Guatemala in May of 2018. I was chosen through my employer - Providence\
  \ Sacred Heart Medical Center to participate in a service trip with other strangers/employees\
  \ from Providence medical locations throughout the United States with our partner\
  \ organization - Medical Teams International. Our project was to build clean water\
  \ systems in a small mountain village. We built gutters off of the roofs of each\
  \ house with a pipe system that corralled rain water to a \"filter\" which we built\
  \ with rocks and charcoal. The rocks and charcoal filtered the water and was then\
  \ was collected in an underground collection tank built into the ground with a hand\
  \ mixed concrete cover and a 6 foot hand pump reaching from the bottom of the tank\
  \ to the top of ground so families could pump out their drinking water. Our goal\
  \ was to provide clean drinking water to combat disease, diarrhea, and infant mortality\
  \ rates from waterborne illness. \nAt the end of our trip, I was asked by the leaders\
  \ of our group to write a blog for the organization's website which I feels encompasses\
  \ my Gifts from Guatemala.\n\"Tomorrow morning, we leave Guatemala. I cannot believe\
  \ our time here has already come to an end. What a whirlwind of emotions, relationships,\
  \ and experiences.\nGoing into this, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I think\
  \ I expected to work grueling hour after grueling hour in the hot sun, day in and\
  \ day out; we worked hard but thankfully had plenty of time to connect with each\
  \ other and each family that we were honored to serve for the day. But I didn't\
  \ realize that I'd make unforgettable relationships and memories in the process.\
  \ I had no idea what an impact the community would have on me and vice versa.  I\
  \ though I'd just work for a few days, then go back home to my ordinary life.\n\
  My fellow volunteers and MTI staff have become a wonderful new family in just 9\
  \ days. We grew together in the most beautiful way from strangers, to acquaintances,\
  \ to friends, to family. It has felt like such a natural bond to be together.\n\
  The remarkable families in San Antonio Beleju that I had the pleasure to work with\
  \ are tattooed on my soul. I'll never be able to put my emotion and love for the\
  \ families into the right words. I quickly became to admire the people, their spirit,\
  \ their culture, and the love they have for one another. I never dreamed saying\
  \ goodbye to the men, women, and children would be so hard until I was giving my\
  \ last hugs and felt the tears falling and my mind racing with the question of -\
  \ will I ever seen them again?\nI have truly unforgettable memories of this experience.\
  \ Javier and Lydia teaching us to harvest coffee - every step from tree to cup;\
  \ making a \"salon\" train of us women and girls all braiding each other's hair;\
  \ watching how Carmella hand plucks feathers from a duck for their dinner; watching\
  \ some of the most beautiful and kind children racing down the hills to great us\
  \ every morning; and the laughter we all had when Rosita allowed us to try on her\
  \ traditional Guatemalan skirt and shirt.\nThis trip has changed us, all of us;\
  \ this I can say with confidence. Reflecting on this trip is an emotional journey\
  \ within itself. I'm thankful for the new friends and family that I gained, the\
  \ excellent direction and leadership that Medical Teams International and Providence\
  \ provided, and the pure joy that has captured our hearts. I'll never forget these\
  \ moments; they're forever ingrained in me as the greatest thing I've ever done\
  \ with my life thus far.\""
