Text: "I could see the wisps of smoke in the distance. Grey hues floating up over\
  \ the canopy, gently touching the sky ahead. That was a good sign, right? If there's\
  \ smoke, there's fire. If there's fire all the way up here\u2026 there would people.\
  \ We'd been hiking up the jungled mountainside for two hours. The sun was beginning\
  \ to set and we still hadn't reached the Pueblito. I pulled out my map and saw the\
  \ cartoon monuments staring up at me from the page. How could this be the guide\
  \ they gave to tourists on entry, everything appeared to be in such close proximity\
  \ \u2013 all smiles and cute illustrations. It looked like an amusement park, not\
  \ a Colombian National Park. I screwed it up in rage and looked to Heath.\n\nWe\
  \ were both dripping in sweat and I could feel panic bubbling just below the surface\
  \ of my skin. We should have known better! We\u2019d passed fellow hikers at the\
  \ entry point, we\u2019d seen the state they were in\u2026 and they\u2019d just\
  \ finished descending the mountain. What was I thinking basing our time and distance\
  \ calculations on that \u201Cmap\u201D? Why didn\u2019t we buy water before we left\
  \ the beach? I saw Heath fain a smile and point at the smoke. \u201CWe can\u2019\
  t be far off, surely there\u2019ll be someone we can get directions from. We\u2019\
  re nearly there.\u201D He said. \n\nAs reached the ruins of the Pueblito dusk settled.\
  \ A thick mist hung in the air suspended between the heat of the day and the cool\
  \ of the night, it crept over the grass and wrapped around the ruin walls. I was\
  \ momentarily lost for words, it was truly beautiful. Wiping my brow with one hand\
  \ I reached for Heath with my other. Enjoying this moment of stillness together,\
  \ we watched the sun disappear as the jungle swallowed the last ray of golden sunset\
  \ light. Instinct kicked in like a jolt, the fire!  \n\nI shivered as we reached\
  \ the fire embers, there was no one to be seen. Heath pulled out his phone and opened\
  \ the pre-downloaded Google map. It struggled with no reception, but there we were,\
  \ a tiny spot in a shroud of green sitting midway between the beach and the park\
  \ exit. Trying to process what this meant all thoughts evaded as a movement in my\
  \ peripheral vision caught my attention. Slowly I turned to face the ruins, my eyes\
  \ locked with those of another. A Kogi was staring unblinkingly at me from across\
  \ the grounds. Soft brown eyes, a face streaked with dirt, white cloth garments\
  \ smudged and frayed. How long had he been standing there? A heavily pregnant woman\
  \ silently joined his side, a small child clung to her ankles. I had heard of the\
  \ indigenous people living in the Sierra Nevada, they are thought to be one of the\
  \ most isolated tribes in the world. \u201CKogi\u201D meaning Jaguar in their native\
  \ tongue, protectors of the land. I called out \u201CD\xF3nde est\xE1 la Salida?\u201D\
  . No one spoke. One by one they each raised a hand and pointed to a trail in the\
  \ distance. \"Gracias!\" we nodded in thanks and made haste, their gaze transfixed\
  \ on us until I could no longer see them. \n\nNight fell quickly, we crept up the\
  \ winding path in darkness. It was pointlessly trying to use our phone torches,\
  \ bats were attracted to the light and had begun swooping us. An hour passed and\
  \ we stopped to rest on a fallen trunk, a howler monkey roared in the distance.\
  \ I quietly contemplated the logistics of spending the night here as fireflies danced\
  \ around us. I knew from watching \u201CBear Grylls\u201D that we should sleep in\
  \ a makeshift hammock suspended above the forest floor. Would that be the best way\
  \ to fend off creepy crawlies? I opened my mouth to tell Heath that I refused to\
  \ be slowly digested by a snake while I slept, but the words fell silent against\
  \ a rustling behind him. \n\nA ranger stepped through the shadows, the moonlight\
  \ illuminated his face and shimmered across the silky coats of the two mules that\
  \ he was leading out of the park."
