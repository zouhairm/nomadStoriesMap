Text: "It wasn't until last year of my employer's default case I'd realize what it's\
  \ like to to be in the state of travel. A severe size of loans & repayment inability\
  \ to one particular bank accounted the Holding Company a decision to lay off most\
  \ of its employees. I wasn't about to be dismissed but I had a look at my staffs\
  \ and knew I ought to offer myself as these people with families to take care of,\
  \ need paychecks more than I would. I got unemployed per November 2018, it was financially\
  \ unhedging decision but as socially responsive as it'd made itself, I decided to\
  \ venture on slightly more volatile road.\n\nDuring my days off from working for\
  \ the Property Developer company who launched successful IPO on 2016 but somehow\
  \ restricted further openings for the market, I'd enjoy delving into solo sports.\
  \ Not the very extroverted type but I delight indulging people I care with food\
  \ & makeover trips as much as I love my own moment off running and swimming intensely\
  \ so freely none would believe I am not an athlete. Every second of my run was an\
  \ everfescent experience; no pressure on all the unspoken desires I could ever feel.\
  \ Dipping in the pool is another story but it had elements of peace and understanding.\
  \ A body of water sustains your entire weight if you respond to its soothes & expose\
  \ your bone & muscles to lightness, ditching the stresses they'd receive from worries\
  \ and depression.\n\nIt was always that sublime when I spent four to five hours\
  \ of those sports leisures. In other occasions I tested my skills in kitchen & boudoir;\
  \ various food mixtures to freeze or fry or bake, organic skincare formulas that\
  \ I had to go though failure before landing on success & propping up close friends\
  \ and family with style taking a little amount of cosmetics but greater on choices\
  \ of clothing and accessories. At work, my subordinates always told me to establish\
  \ the business so they could assist me; I always translated it as their boredom\
  \ of current employment & looking for a more enjoyable life. But I saw entrepreneurship\
  \ as no joke; startups got termimated for unreliable reasons including deleveraging\
  \ quantity of sales or fraud case; Theranos is an example. Investing in ourselves\
  \ is foremost important & I planned on career in the Financial Market after I ended\
  \ the Real Estate one. I began taking GRE courses for eligibility to take MSc in\
  \ Finance; be it FinMath, FinEng or the Global Finance and GRE cause I saw by my\
  \ eyes how precious your resume would be if you came from one of the top universities\
  \ in the USA or UK. What I wouldn't have seen would be how to get there considering\
  \ financial limitation and possibility of rejection. \n\nI always had the creeping\
  \ thoughts of reality that when others caught me in the act they would ask why would\
  \ I be so sad. It's not sadness it's a contemplation; different meanings. When my\
  \ course provider announcing partial MBA scholarship open-days from two Australian\
  \ Universities I wasn't thinking further of joining. I had the first one, it was\
  \ that long tiring Saturday zillion doubts waiting to trap me; 30 different kinds\
  \ of competitive attendants, aptitude tests with numerical and verbal assessments,\
  \ Professor-level assessors & I am not one to overlook my thoughts and feelings.\
  \ They told us result would come out in three days but after a week I didn't hear\
  \ a thing. So doubt was legitimizing its claim about me, but I had to move on. Then\
  \ four days across my birthday I got an official text informing I was one of two\
  \ who got the partial scholarship... In that moment I felt like after passing a\
  \ loss down an abyss and got up while embracing dark energy, the treasure found\
  \ me at the edge of open space.\n\nWe are travelers in a life that doesn't last\
  \ forever. Bravery and courage simply add details in pictures that we paint before\
  \ our time is up. I felt gratitude for that University grant & I am pursuing the\
  \ other objectives requiring this body & mind to leap into the unknown. In my reflective\
  \ moments I still delve in those solo sports & cooking."
