Text: "If you live in Europe at winter time most probably you would have the same\
  \ problem as me of lacking the sun and vitamin D3 in your blood which makes you\
  \ feel depressed and start doing winter hibernation at home until the end of winter.\n\
  This year I decided to save my vacations from last year to go somewhere sunny and\
  \ warm in the winter. I checked the map and I found a beautiful nature in South\
  \ African city \u201CCapetown\u201D with 30\xB0C while in Berlin was -1\xB0C at\
  \ the same time.\nEverything on my trip was very spontaneous. My plan was to first\
  \ spend 3 Days in Capetown and then the rest I go on the Garden route (a place you\
  \ can have crazy hiking, bungee jumping, and National parks). I just had only a\
  \ general idea for what I want to do but I didn\u2019t plan for any details.\n\n\
  Beginning of my first day I did the city tour bus it is a cheap way for transportation\
  \ if you want to do a 1-day trip to many places, the bus station was only 2 mins\
  \ far from the hostel.\n\nI booked the Deluxe Hop On-Hop Off Tour it offers the\
  \ blue and red lines which has the most sightseeing places and the sunset bus is\
  \ included.\n\nMy first stop was in Kirstenbosch. It is a super beautiful landscape\
  \ garden with huge green areas and the table mountain in the background. Unfortunately,\
  \ it started to rain after 30 mins of being there. \nI heard there are some concerts\
  \ happening on weekends in the stage at this place, check it because I didn\u2019\
  t have a chance to do it! but some other travelers did it and they said it is really\
  \ great.\n\nIt was time for late lunch and the rain stopped so I took the bus to\
  \ Hout Bay. I got nice seafood on the Bay with a nice view of the beach. then I\
  \ was watching big 2 seals sitting on the shore and people were feeding them and\
  \ cuddling them.\n\nAfter that, It was almost sunset. I took the sunset bus to signal\
  \ hill where you can see Capetown city from the top and see the sunset over the\
  \ city with the table mountain in the background. I was not so lucky to do paragliding\
  \ because of the weather. but I had so much nice time there. but don\u2019t forget\
  \ to take a jacket with you it was freezing up there.\n\nDay after, I asked some\
  \ of the travelers I met the day before to get to join me and get a taxi to Cape\
  \ point where we can see the Atlantic and Indian oceans meets.\nthe watercolors\
  \ and mountains were really calm peaceful environment.\n\nThen we headed to boulder\
  \ beach to see the penguins.\nBoulder beach has 2 parts. the first one is penguin\
  \ park where you can see the penguins behind the fence and the other place is boulders\
  \ beach where you can see few penguins and get a closer look to them and if you\
  \ are lucky you can swim with them. don\u2019t miss this part. because most of the\
  \ traveliers miss it.\n\nGarden route was a super crazy adventure we saw lions,\
  \ elephants, and bomba from Simba movie. we did bungee jumping and lots of hike\
  \ in the beautiful nature."
