Text: "Once in 2016 while I was travelling to Bangladesh, I met an African lady in\
  \ Dubai Airport which she was really beautiful and hot. In that time I was single\
  \ and had not such dare to propose girls my wishes. She was sit just beside me in\
  \ the waiting halls of the airport and by chance we rode to the same bus while going\
  \ to other Terminal. In the bus, she was sit behind me and there were other people\
  \ in the front seats. However, I wanted to be in a connection with her, I turned\
  \ my face to her saying hi!\nShe smiled saying hi and I started asking her where\
  \ she is going and where did she come now. She continued speaking with me and then\
  \ I told her if she is single or married. She told she is married and has not met\
  \ her husband since 6 months as she was far from her house due to some assignments\
  \ in Dubai. I thought okay now it is impossible for me to propose her; and instead\
  \ changed my idea to establish a lovely relationship with her but on this occasion\
  \ the bus arrived to the Terminal Station and we couldn't continue our discussions.\
  \ \nIt was not a good time for me that how soon the bus reached and I couldn't continue\
  \ my discussions with her :("
