Text: "My wife and I have always been travel obsessed. We have traveled through most\
  \ of the provinces in our beautiful country, South Africa. \n\nIn December, last\
  \ year, we decided to take a different route to the in-laws... A quite adventurous\
  \ route. By adventurous, I mean, driving over a series of mountains with a non-4x4\
  \ vehicle, and a road so rocky and narrow that an ATV could barely fit. Here's how\
  \ it all went wrong:\n\nAs we made it to the last 200 kilometers or so of our road\
  \ trip, we entered the legendary Uniondale town. The town is famous for its \"lady\
  \ ghost\" or rather \"The Ghost of Uniondale\", as she's more known as. The tale\
  \ goes like this: she and her fiance had a terrible accident with his motorcycle.\
  \ They were very much in love, soulmates, and were to get married soon. He survived,\
  \ but sadly she didn't. Now her ghost roams the accident scene, waiting for him\
  \ to pick her up. But lately, she would get into any car to get to her love. She\
  \ would stand in the exact same spot where the accident took place, trying to hitch\
  \ a drive. Once you start entering the town, she would disappear into thin air.\
  \ \n\nSo, as we entered the town, we started talking about this urban legend and\
  \ just laughed it off. We don't believe in ghosts or anything supernatural. \n\n\
  The town is a real small town, no more than about 150 people live there. There are\
  \ barely any shops and you would have to cross mountains(literally) to get to the\
  \ closest city. As we exited the town, we came to a stop and a choice to make...\
  \ Do we take the road to the left or the one on the right? \nThe GPS, that we have\
  \ set just before we drove through town (we made sure we took the adventurous but\
  \ less dangerous road!), said we should go left. Boy, was that a big mistake! \n\
  \nWe traveled on a dirt road, admiring all the beautiful farmlands and waterfalls\
  \ along the way. It wasn't until about 30 kilometers into our journey that we realised\
  \ the GPS took us onto the dangerous mountain pass! We were 100% sure we didn't\
  \ set it for this route (did the Ghost of Uniondale interfere, perhaps?) \n\nThe\
  \ road was bumpy, rocky, and sandy. Our little car barely stayed on the road. Sharp\
  \ turns, scary ascends, steep descends, and narrow parts! This was like riding a\
  \ roller coaster. Halfway through, we realized the GPS had died. We checked out\
  \ phones, no signal. That is just great! We were lost, in the middle of nowhere,\
  \ surrounded by mountains and God knows what else. This was the perfect setting\
  \ for a horror movie. We kept driving until we could find a piece of road wide enough\
  \ for two cars to pass. We pulled over and started searching through our luggage\
  \ for the charger. We couldn't find it. Great! \n\nWe waited alongside the road,\
  \ for a car to pass by. After about 4 hours of patiently waiting, a car eventually\
  \ drove past. We flagged him down and he gladly showed us the way out to civilization.\
  \ Never again will we take the \"scenic\" route!"
