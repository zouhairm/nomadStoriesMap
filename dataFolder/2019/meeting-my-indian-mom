Text: "My first time in India wasn't exactly planned. I decided to join a travel group\
  \ just one month before the boarding date. I didn't know any member of the group\
  \ and didn't have any idea of what I was going to find in such a distant and different\
  \ country. Just felt I needed to go.\n       It's a pretty long trip from Brazil\
  \ to India. But the fatigue of the journey did not diminish the excitement of meeting\
  \ this ancient culture. We just arrived in New Delhi and everything sounded strangely\
  \ familiar. The streets' chaos seemed perfectly fluid and every sense was extremely\
  \ stimulated. The sounds, the colors, the smells, the Indians guys' gaze... everything\
  \ was intense.\n      Most places I stopped by, some locals approached me as they\
  \ knew me for a long time. They tried to talk to me in Hindi. Maybe, due to my physiognomy\
  \ they thought I was indian too. But the most remarkable experience happened I was\
  \ finishing the Taj Mahal tour. An old ladie wearing a colorful saree hugged me\
  \ with tenderness that we both got emotional. We didn't speak the same language,\
  \ but we had a connection. She didn't speak english, so I asked her son what was\
  \ she feeling, and he said that she felt like I was her daughter, as she knew me\
  \ from other life. We spent a long time there in front of that love monument communicating\
  \ without words. And until nowadays I have a vivid memory of the big expressive\
  \ eyes of my Indian mom."
