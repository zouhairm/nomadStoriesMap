Text: "At the early age of 5, I knew there was a world out there that my small mind\
  \ wanted to comprehend. The people I met, the words they spoke, the lives they lived,\
  \ I wanted to understand. My family would tell me the world is this big, dangerous\
  \ ball of hell. That whatever was out there was going to hurt me. For some reason,\
  \ that drew me in even more. I would sit by the television, watch travel shows,\
  \ and figure out what exactly was out there. 12 years later, I decided to make a\
  \ decision that would change the course in my life. I bought a flight to Germany\
  \ for 3 weeks. My teacher, at the time, Mr Boulanger, was teaching me about The\
  \ Holocaust, and in between lessons, he would teach us German words. The more days\
  \ passed by, the more he taught me, the more I started to fall in love with Germany.\
  \ I then decided one day, right after my 9 hour shift to start teaching myself German.\
  \ Hours went to days, days went to weeks, and weeks turned into months I was teaching\
  \ myself. That's when, while I was at school, I bought a flight. I never told my\
  \ mom until a week before my flight was departing. My school knew this was something\
  \ I had to do, and without a second thought, on December 4th, I got on my first\
  \ ever flight, by myself. I cried because 3 weeks was the longest I have ever intentionally\
  \ been away from my family, and friends, but I don't regret the decision. I learned\
  \ so much when I was there. The aroma of the food filled my soul(such as Bratwurst\
  \ and Kartoffel which you during Christmas you can wash down with Gl\xFChwein),\
  \ the culture presented to me made me feel like I could adapt to something so different,\
  \ and the language gave me a different perspective in conversation. I saw how my\
  \ 'usual' routines changed to the German lifestyle, and watched my respect for the\
  \ history of Germany (being more than World Wars and The Holocaust) sprouted into\
  \ my questions. More adventures. The world my family had so much been scared to\
  \ introduce me to has given me the best open arm welcome it could offer."
