Text: "The early morning humidity of the swamp can take or leave you; it has a life\
  \ of it's own. I laid at its edges, desperate for rest. The sun pierces my eyes\
  \ through the cypress leaves and I give up and roll over on my side. Via an odd\
  \ series of happenings, I lay in the thicket next to some Florida train tracks.\
  \ My friend Julia is still asleep, her radio faintly buzzing in her wilted palm.\
  \ It's moments like this that I seem to continually find myself: awake, alone and\
  \ waiting. \n\nWe had spent the night prior riding up the Florida pan handle. Our\
  \ next train was sure to come this afternoon. Julia could sleep and as always, I\
  \ could not. As the day crept forward, we shifted positions in the same spot. Julie\
  \ woke up. I peed. She went to the store for water. I changed my clothes. These\
  \ small changes moved the day forward until our train was due to show. Soon enough,\
  \ the sun faced us and we were anxiously checking the time and scanning the tracks.\
  \ Julie shifted through radio stations and voices would perch our attention and\
  \ then quickly dissipate it. \n\nThe usual fears crept in. What if it never comes.\
  \ What if these tracks are dead. We bargained with the circumstances. We'd wait\
  \ 24 hours and then we'd hitch out of there. This offered some relief but the tension\
  \ was found in small remarks. Frustration disguised in flippant comebacks, sharper\
  \ jokes, more forceful distractions. Even though we could still get where we were\
  \ going, this made us anxious. It made us anxious because we cared. Trains made\
  \ us feel independent. We could feel the wind as we saw towns flash by. There was\
  \ no need to make forced small talk with truckers, or linger at gas stations. All\
  \ you needed was to know when the train was going to leave.\n\nThe next day came\
  \ with a sort of bitter acceptance. We branched out to the store. Bought supplies\
  \ for road. Ate our snacks on the concrete. The clock kept ticking. We had an hour\
  \ left. We figured we'd spend the last half hour in the thicket and then make our\
  \ way to the road. As we were walking back to our original spot, the sound of a\
  \ golf cart caught our attention and we fervently threw ourselves into the bushes\
  \ to our left. That was too close. The man in the cart whizzed by us. His face wasn't\
  \ a meter apart from ours. The only reason he didn't see us was because he didn't\
  \ look. We sat there sort of paralyzed for a while. We only snapped out of to the\
  \ sound of the radio proclaiming digits and just like that the faint sound of an\
  \ engine lifted our eyebrows. We didn't let ourselves become hopeful but we certainly\
  \ were very eager to find the source of the noise. \n\nAnd just like that, a train\
  \ comes whizzing past. At this point, we're still uncertain. Maybe it won't stop.\
  \ It had to have been 24 hours to the dot. One by one, the train cars read clearer\
  \ and suddenly, it's coming to a stop. This is it. We stare at each other and without\
  \ another moment of hesitation we grab our bags. There was a ridable container just\
  \ 10 meters down the tracks. It wasn't 5 minutes after we threw ourselves in that\
  \ the train lurched and started moving. We stared in amazement, barely able to contain\
  \ our excitement. \n\nThe train made its way through southern backwoods and swamps,\
  \ through small towns and pastures. We sat quietly, staring at the route. Once the\
  \ sun went down, the fireflies came out. The entire swamp was lit up with glowing\
  \ green-yellow lights. You could hear the life of the swamp from the frogs and the\
  \ birds and the bugs. I felt so completely at ease. The train continued on into\
  \ the morning and we continued with our journey, never fully anticipating what waited\
  \ ahead."
