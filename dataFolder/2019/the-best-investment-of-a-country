Text: "When I was about to fly to Singapore I heard it was a very rigid country, with\
  \ lots of rules, nearly without a soul. I didn't expect at all to find a very conscious\
  \ direction, attentive to the population moods and needs.\nSingapore has its own\
  \ problems as every other country in the world and it is true, the country has very\
  \ rigid rules, however I can see that the rules have been chosen for the best of\
  \ the citizens. But most of all, Singapore is doing a great effort in informing\
  \ people and in giving positive suggestions. For sure it requires some money from\
  \ the state, but the results are priceless! In exchange you can live in a really\
  \ safe, constructing and positive environment. What am i talking about concretely?\
  \ Singapore spends money in panels, advertising banners, promotions along the train-metro\
  \ lines and bus stops to make any message reach the entire population. \nLet me\
  \ give you some examples and you will get it better. There is an outbreak of a dengue\
  \ in a \nneighborhood... so what? The cases and their location are registered and\
  \ fast a banner is attached all around warning people to be alert on symptoms and\
  \ to get precautions.  The population is getting older and the country is facing\
  \ an increase demand of health services, some diseases such as diabetes are spreading...\
  \ so what does Singapore do? We see panels that suggest you you to download the\
  \ \"Healthy App Challenge\", you get point if you eat healthy in particular food\
  \ stalls, you can do a questionnaire and you can check what you can improve in your\
  \ lifestyle, you can redeem some prizes! Then due to the past history Singaporians\
  \ are very  workaholic and focused on money.... so what do you see around? A panel\
  \ with a football fan that is collecting trash in the stadium with written \"greatness\
  \ comes from values\" (with the word \"values\" cancelling the word \"victory\"\
  ). A guy helping an old women to cross the street with written \"greatness is about\
  \ the care you give\" (with \"the care you give\" cancelling \"car you drive\").\
  \  An other example about ecology: there is a huge use of plastic cutlery and a\
  \ huge waste of food... So here comes panels informing with data of the situation,\
  \ encouraging people to be the change and to compromise themselves. Singapore ask\
  \ people to make a photo  of themselves when doing an eco-act and monthly there\
  \ will be a winner...\nSomeone can see all of this as a \"brain-washing\" or \"\
  mind-shaping\" and thus as something wrong, there can be a debate on it. However\
  \ I believe this attitude of spreading positive examples and acts is highly positive\
  \ especially if is accompanied by forming an open-minded and thinking population.\
  \ Still there is work to do in this direction: to form a conscious thinking-population\
  \ can be a challenging task for a country, in particular if the school education\
  \ is not free.  In the meantime this higher objective will be hopefully reached,\
  \ Singapore stands in the middle of lots of other countries. While globally we are\
  \ getting used to see campaigns based on attacking the enemy, Singapore is spending\
  \ money to spread positiveness.\nI am happy having discovered this side of Singapore\
  \ and I hope through my text this positiveness will spread also beyond the borders."
