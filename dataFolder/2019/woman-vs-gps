Text: "I almost made a farewell video to my family. That\u2019s how certain I was\
  \ that I'd made a mistake resulting in my untimely demise while driving the Ring\
  \ Road in Iceland. I was 6 days into a 180-day sabbatical from my life as a Certified\
  \ Public Accountant when disaster struck. \n\nUp to this point, I\u2019d had the\
  \ typical Icelandic tourist experience: The Golden Circle, eating an Icelandic hot\
  \ dog, and relaxing in the Blue Lagoon. However, upon leaving Reykjavik, it\u2019\
  s you versus nature. It\u2019s you versus gas prices. And it\u2019s you versus GPS.\
  \ I had daily conversations with GPS that (in my mind) went something like this:\
  \ \n\nMe:\_Take me to\_Ger\xF0uberg Cliffs\nGPS:\_I don\u2019t work that way...\n\
  Me:\_Fine. Take me to Kirkjufell Mountain then.\_\nGPS:\_No, girl. I need an address...\n\
  Me:\_It\u2019s just off the side of the road, there\u2019s no address, per se.\n\
  GPS:\_Give up. Go home. I can take you\_there.\n\nAs an aside, travelers should\
  \ know that many Icelandic points of interest don\u2019t have an address. GPS likes\
  \ addresses. But you know what GPS loves? Coordinates. That is how I was able to\
  \ obtain directions to many places the GPS tried to fight me on. \n\nIt happened\
  \ on the morning I left Seydisfjordur (a quiet and beautiful town with a waterfall\
  \ nearly everywhere you look). I hopped in the car and fired up the GPS (I had an\
  \ address), fired up my book on tape, and set off for Hofn. About 90 minutes in,\
  \ I sent my mother this text: \_\n\_\n\u201CI need prayers! I was driving and the\
  \ road turned to snow and my car just stopped moving. Like it will not go. On a\
  \ road so narrow I did a 6-point turn (maybe more) to turn around. Now I\u2019m\
  \ parked on the side of the road. I don\u2019t know what to do. This car simply\
  \ cannot make it.\u201D \n\nI called the rental company and told them my location:\
  \ I was on the Ring Road between Seydisfjordur and Hofn.  They checked the roads\
  \ and said they were passable for\_all\_car types. Then she said \u201Cand if you\
  \ get stuck call 112; they will make sure you make it.\u201D\_\n\_\nCould\_my car\
  \ make it over that hill? Maybe beyond that hill were clear roads. I couldn\u2019\
  t wimp out.\n\_\nSo, I drove back up to the hill and floored it! And made it! I\
  \ felt like a (s)hero. Like a boss. Like a captainess of my own destiny because\
  \ I had powered through that scary moment. Then, everything around me became white.\
  \ The beautiful, ethereal landscape of jagged mountains cut out by glaciers and\
  \ random fields of moss-covered lava simply vanished. I was in a blinding snowstorm.\
  \ Suddenly, I was guided only by yellow posts on either side of the road. After\
  \ some time, I neared a peculiarly short post and thought: \u201CIs that post\_\
  buried\_in the snow?\u201D With a jerk, my car stopped moving. There was no 6-point\
  \ turning out of this one. I couldn\u2019t reverse. I couldn\u2019t move forward.\
  \ I was truly stuck. I called 112. Multiple times, actually. But all the calls dropped.\
  \ I\u2019d been driving 4 hours and hadn\u2019t seen a single car on the road that\
  \ day.\n\nI was doomed. \n\n\u2026For about 30 minutes (during which I contemplated\
  \ the farewell video and rationing gas).  \n\_\_\nThen, providentially, a 4 x 4\
  \ truck started coming down the mountain. A figure in full snow gear jumped out\
  \ and approached my car. A woman!\n\_\nWoman who saved me:\_You cannot drive in\
  \ these conditions with a car like this. (Looking at my tires in disgust) With tires\
  \ like this!\n\nMe: I\u2019m trying to go to Hofn! I\u2019m on Route 1! My GPS says\
  \ this is the way!\n\nWoman who saved me: (looking at my GPS) This is not Route\
  \ 1. Your GPS took you down a shortcut. This is a mountain road. You have to go\
  \ back and get back on the Ring Road.\_\n\nMe: I don\u2019t think I can move this\
  \ car...\n\nWoman who saved me:\_Would you like me to turn it around for you?\_\n\
  \_\nAnd just like that I was saved! \n\_\nLesson: Watch that GPS like a hawk."
