Text: "I realized that I was really feeling lonely. That hard winter feeling got deep\
  \ into my soul. And it was still february, no hope of sunlight shining over Antwerp\
  \ and its beautiful gothic style buildings. The Ninth Synphony of Beethoven touched\
  \ my heart every morning, coming from the huge Cathedral nearby, but still I missed\
  \ my big and warm Brazil. It was a new sensation for me, these plain gray days coming\
  \ one after another. \nOf course somethings made me very happy. Let me say, for\
  \ instance, that I never thought of drinking such a good strong beer like Westmalle.\
  \ We had a long way to go in Brazil, when talking about brewing. I was also astonished\
  \ with the possibility of meeting people from all around the world, that was very\
  \ impressive. A Master Chef from Morocco, his polish wife, a nice girl from Bosnia\
  \ and a beautiful guy from Nepal were some of my new friends on the road. But still,\
  \ that cold feeling had caught me. A tropical girl like me could not imagine how\
  \ important the sun is to warm up our human spirit.\nI was just wondering about\
  \ that, sadly walking around the cold concrete sidewalk, when I accidentally bumped\
  \ into a man. I was ashamed and trying to say I was sorry. Itried in english, in\
  \ spanish, in flamish. Useless. He simply wouldn\xB4t understand, and kept looking\
  \ at me without a word to say. When I finally stopped trying to make myself understood,\
  \ this guy opened the best sunshine smile I had aver seen, and said outloud: Egypt.\n\
  Oh, ok, no I get it. Maybe I should have spoken some Arabic. It made me smile like\
  \ I had never done before since I left Brazil. And from there he started talking,\
  \ with a lot of the funniest gestures only he could make up, trying and in fact\
  \ making himself understood. Well, I thought, let's play some mimics then, why not?\
  \ I entered the game and he was also laughing like a baby. After a couple of minutes\
  \ of conversation, he left. He had to work, that is what I could understand. Said.\
  \ Said had to work and he was a bricklayer. Said made me laugh until my chicks couldn't\
  \ stand no more. Said came from the land of river Nilo, the land of the Pyramids,\
  \ the land of shining sun. Besides all that information, I was convicted to have\
  \ a meeting later on that night. A cup of hot coffee around the Cathedral square,\
  \ at seven o'clock.\nFor the first time in that lonely journey I felt so happy.\
  \ It seems like the guy from the land of pharaohs really brought me the sun I was\
  \ missing. The warmth I needed to face up the remaining cold and gray days until\
  \ spring time. The only thing I was really worried about: did we really understood\
  \ each other? Did I really had this date in the coming evening? It was all about\
  \ mimics. We could hardly understand a word from each other.\nWith all these thougths\
  \ remaining in my brain, I made it to the square before seven. All these people\
  \ passing by, coming from work, going out for a beer in one of the many pubs around.\
  \ I started feeling a little bit weird. Even a bit stupid. How could I think I had\
  \ a date with an egyptian man that didn't even speak any of the languages I could\
  \ understand? Maybe I should just go back to my hostel. It is very could out here\
  \ anyway. Well, maybe I could even grab a beer before I go. \nStanding by the counter\
  \ inside the glass wall of my favorite pub nearby, ready to ask for my delicious,\
  \ dark and strong Westmalle, I suddenly saw this white dressed arabic shake looking\
  \ guy out on the street. Oh, god, he had come. My mimic game was not bad at all!\
  \ When I reached him, unlike me, he seemed not surprised to find his tropical friend.\
  \ Next thing, we were in the best scenic arab place, in the middle of beautiful\
  \ Antwerp, drinking the warmest cup of coffee ever, with the best taste of cardamom\
  \ enlightening my spirit."
