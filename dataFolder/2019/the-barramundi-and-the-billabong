Text: "It was May 1999, and I was backpacking around Australia. I was on a tour to\
  \ Litchfield National Park, departing from Darwin. It was a small group, we gelled\
  \ well, I knew this would be a good trip. \n\nThe first day was spent admiring the\
  \ huge termite mounds, and visiting pretty waterfalls. Some of the guys in the group\
  \ were keen fishermen, and they set up their rods at a waterhole. Someone made a\
  \ catch: a beautiful, large Barramundi.  Hence came the first change to the standard\
  \ tour itinerary \u2013 dinner! I don\u2019t recall what was on the menu, but all\
  \ were in agreement to ditch it in favour of fresh Barramundi. Honestly, I hadn\u2019\
  t been a fish fan up to that point, but boy was I in for a pleasant surprise.\n\n\
  We arrived at our camping spot, near protected land which belonged to a group of\
  \ Indigenous Australians. We gathered firewood whilst the fish was filleted.  When\
  \ we returned, a local indigenous fella Waru* was chatting with our fisherman, the\
  \ fish had caught his eye and been a conversation-starter. After he left, the Barra\
  \ was wrapped in foil and tossed onto the flames.  Soon it was ready to serve. The\
  \ cold cans of \u201CVB\u201D were handed around from the \"esky\", and we tucked\
  \ in. I\u2019d never before eaten fish so fresh. The rich flavour mingled with hints\
  \ of butter and smoke. It was moist and tender, the flakes of fish melted in my\
  \ mouth. All complemented by the bitter taste of VB. \n\nHere I was, a 19-year-old\
  \ from the English suburbs, sat in the Australian outback around a fire, eating\
  \ fresh fish and surrounded by new friends. So far out of my comfort zone, yet I\
  \ couldn\u2019t be happier. Someone played a guitar, we sang, we drank more VB.\
  \ Eventually the group quietened down. We knew there were snakes and insects, but\
  \ not one of us slept in tents. We formed a circle around the fire, and slept top-to-toe.\
  \ As people settled down around me, I looked into the flames and felt at peace.\
  \ The last sounds I heard as I drifted off to sleep, were the gentle crackle of\
  \ the fire, and the wind in the trees.  \n\nThe following morning, Waru came back\
  \ and invited us onto his land to fish. Our guide explained that this was a privilege,\
  \ it had never happened on her tour before. Did we want to accept, or stick with\
  \ the planned itinerary? \n\nWe sat in the back of Waru\u2019s Ute. He set off at\
  \ speed, we were bounced and thrown around like sacks of spuds. When we stopped,\
  \ he asked us to stand clear, along a billabong which edged the clearing. We were\
  \ shocked to see him light a fire, until he explained. It was early in the dry season,\
  \ there was a high chance of a natural bushfire and Waru did not want his truck\
  \ to burn. By burning out the area around his Ute, he was ensuring there was no\
  \ fuel to sustain a fire in its path. \n\nWe set off along the billabong. Muddy\
  \ water lapped my new sneakers. I don\u2019t care! I thought, this is totally worth\
  \ it. The billabong grew deeper, covering my sneakers, past my knees, it was approaching\
  \ my shorts. I removed my camera from my pocket and held it high, as the water level\
  \ rose above my waist. None of us were prepared for this, all around me designer\
  \ clothes were getting ruined and expensive gadgets were held high. But laughter\
  \ filled the air, we were loving every second. \n\nSomeone asked Waru about crocodiles,\
  \ he was non-committal with his response. I felt sure my travel insurance wouldn\u2019\
  t cover this, and grinned. My enjoyment was tinged with anxiety when I noticed a\
  \ leach on the neck of one of my comrades! But eventually we reached the spot, and\
  \ the fishermen set up. The rest of us flicked away the mozzies, picked leeches\
  \ off each other and relived our trek. Everyone was buzzing with excitement. \n\n\
  Finally it was time to return to Darwin. None of us would forget Waru, or this adventure\
  \ he\u2019d given us.   \n\n*not his real name"
