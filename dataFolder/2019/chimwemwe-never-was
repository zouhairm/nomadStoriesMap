Text: "A fire crackled and the sweet scent of cedar permeated the stuffy air inside\
  \ the hut. Ripples of dust danced in the slithers of light coming through the windows.\
  \ To my left, an empty sleeping bag lay crumpled on a thin mattress. Outside morning\
  \ was in full swing, which could only mean one thing: we were late.\n\nStepping\
  \ onto the shady patio, I noticed a slight figure standing on the hill above the\
  \ hut. Gift, my guide, was trying to get signal to call his heavily pregnant sister\
  \ in their home village down the valley.\n\nSince the previous day we\u2019d been\
  \ hiking through maize and pineapple fields, dripping with sweat, until we reached\
  \ the thick darkness of the subtropical forest that covers the sloping foot of Mount\
  \ Mulanje. When we\u2019d finally stopped for the night at Madzeka hut, a corridor\
  \ of gardenias planted by the caretaker had welcomed us.\n\n\u201CMwazuka bwanji\u201D\
  \ Gift called out \u201CI am now a proud uncle!\u201D I cheered and ran up to him.\
  \ Close to becoming an auntie myself, I was very pleased. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a\
  \ girl. What should her name be?\u201D\n\u201CI don\u2019t know! Shouldn\u2019t\
  \ the mum and dad decide?\u201D\n\nBut the dad, he explained, had left for South\
  \ Africa six months before to look for work. For three months now they had heard\
  \ nothing from him, and the little money that used to come had stopped altogether.\
  \ In this moment, amongst the smell of cedar, I became painfully aware of the completely\
  \ different lives my niece and Gift\u2019s would live.\n\n\u201CI know! We will\
  \ call her Alyiannah!\u201D he grinned. I categorically refused the baby be given\
  \ a distortion of my own mzungu (white) name.\n\n\u201CWhat about Chimwemwe?\u201D\
  \ I suggested, choosing the name that promised happiness in local language. \u201C\
  This way she\u2019ll be forever happy.\u201D \n\nWe set off for our second day of\
  \ hiking, which was harder than the first: there was not a hint of a cloud in the\
  \ dense blue sky and the mountain plateau offered no shade but scattered bush undergrowth.\n\
  \nWhen we reached our second camp, I jumped in the nearby pools: a rush of freezing\
  \ water to cool my frying brain, a juicy leaf of aloe vera to soothe my burning\
  \ skin. At dusk we cooked nsima and beans, then slept early, ready to tackle the\
  \ long descent down the \u201CElephant Path\u201D in the morning.\n\nWhen I woke\
  \ the following day Gift was already out, looking for signal. I peered out of the\
  \ window to see him sitting with his chin in his hands - a stark silhouette against\
  \ the pink light touching the peaks.\n\n\u201CSo what did you decide? Is Chimwemwe\
  \ ok?\u201D I shouted. He turned. The mischievous grin of a young boy had gone.\
  \ \u201CWe don\u2019t need to decide anymore. There were some problems; they moved\
  \ them to District Hospital. But when a doctor arrived, he wasn\u2019t able to help\
  \ either of them\u201D.\n\nThe simplicity of Gift\u2019s words struck me down. Though\
  \ the pain in his eyes was obvious, to him and everyone else in Malawi, life and\
  \ death just happen: no frills, no drama.\n\nWe descended in silence for what felt\
  \ like days. I couldn\u2019t come to terms with the fact that in guiding me up the\
  \ mountain, earning his living to support his sister and niece, Gift had missed\
  \ the chance to say goodbye to both of them.\n\nThe whole village attended the funeral.\
  \ As is custom, I brought maize flour, sugar and tea to help the family during mourning.\
  \ Orphaned at a young age and with his sister gone, Gift was his own family now.\n\
  \n\u201CThank you so much,\u201D he said, \u201CThough I like rooibos tea better...\u201D\
  \ He grinned, a shadow of his boyish self in the corner of his lips.\n\nA month\
  \ later I was at home cuddling my newborn niece, her rosy forehead wrinkled from\
  \ a bad dream. The TV humming and her deep breathing were the only sounds. Different\
  \ mountains, capped with snow but with no sweet scented cedars, kept us safe in\
  \ their sturdy embrace.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry my little one.\u201D I told her,\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re forever happy.\u201D"
