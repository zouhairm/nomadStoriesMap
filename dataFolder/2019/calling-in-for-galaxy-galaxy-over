Text: "We spent Christmas aboard Galaxy with our makeshift family, a collection of\
  \ humans as joyfully mismatched as the cutlery we used to dig into our shared meal.\
  \ A Swiss captain who travels the world before a degenerative eye disease takes\
  \ it away. A Canadian couple mourning a baby. South African parents who found space\
  \ for exploration within their empty nest. Molly the hound. And Zouhair and me.\
  \ I wonder how others would describe us.\n\nWe exchanged gifts that only sea drifters\
  \ would qualify as treasures. Fresh razor blades, a fish hook, a usb key with pirated\
  \ movies, a seashell charm. We blasted Christmas music in the hot Tanzanian air,\
  \ laying down a surreal soundtrack to the surrounding ballet of fishing dhows for\
  \ which this was just another day at sea. We drank and laughed and somehow, in the\
  \ middle of nowhere, amongst complete strangers, there it was: a little slice of\
  \ home.\n\nMy husband and I have been sailing around Zanzibar for almost a couple\
  \ of months now. Galaxy, our 60 foot Turkish Gulet, sticks out like a spaceship\
  \ in the wild coves of Pemba \u2014 and frankly, we don\u2019t fit in any better.\
  \ Every outing through the mangrove channels takes the allure of a proper expedition.\
  \ There are eyes in the bush, reflecting our own curiosity for another people. We\
  \ wave and shout out a soup of swahili greetings, \u201CDjambo!\u201D \u201CMambo!\u201D\
  \ \u201CAbariako!\u201D. I\u2019m not sure what each one means. Some variation of\
  \ hello and how are you. Soon we hear \u201CKaribouni!\u201D. I know this one. They\u2019\
  re saying welcome.\n\nWe disembark. The children are always the first to greet us.\
  \ They squeal and giggle as we set off into the village with our cortege of little\
  \ bare feet. There\u2019s a fair share of huts made with sticks and weaved banana\
  \ leaves, but most homes are built out of bare concrete. Some have holes for windows,\
  \ few have doors. Clothing hangs out to dry. Threads, really. These people are the\
  \ poorest I have ever met, yet no one looks hungry. Chicken peck at the dirt between\
  \ the roots of huge baobab trees that remind us that this land is old and enduring.\
  \ Meanwhile, Zou deploys all of his islamic charm to befriend merchants and negotiate\
  \ the price of scroungy, uber-organic tomatoes. \n\nThere\u2019s so much more I\
  \ could write about. Desert beaches to put postcards to shame and night skies that\u2019\
  ll make you believe you\u2019re seeing stars for the first time. The craftsmanship\
  \ of fishing dhows and the elegance of the men who sail them. The huge yellowfin\
  \ tuna we ate raw on the deck of our boat (and at every meal for the following 5\
  \ days...). Dancing in Nungwi, a full-moon party spot where 5 star resorts mushroom\
  \ out of the sand and drugs flow right at the edge of traditional villages. The\
  \ speed at witch the expat community adopted us there, their hunger for new white\
  \ faces, even transiting ones, their colonial brand of racism and ambivalence towards\
  \ Africa the bountiful, Africa the broken, this poisonous heaven they call home.\n\
  \nFor all the wonder, there\u2019s been equal hardship. The romantic vision paints\
  \ this life, who knows no master but the weather, as the pinnacle of freedom. But\
  \ I\u2019ve felt stranded on this boat. Galaxy is urging me to sit still although\
  \ the b*tch gets to rock constantly, and I resent her for it. I want out of this\
  \ humidity that steams the meat right off my bones. I want to be able to take a\
  \ walk when I need to clear my head, I want my alone time back, I want it so bad\
  \ I could cry. I want to wear city clothes and drive my car. I want to take a proper\
  \ shower in a proper bathroom. I want to figure out my life, preferably with decent\
  \ internet.\n\nGalaxy couldn\u2019t care less about what I want. Maybe it\u2019\
  s because she\u2019s been focused on giving me what I need instead. Time to stop\
  \ and digest momentous life changes undertaken all at once. A chance to face my\
  \ fears and find my edges. A view of the horizon, and what might lay right behind\
  \ it."
