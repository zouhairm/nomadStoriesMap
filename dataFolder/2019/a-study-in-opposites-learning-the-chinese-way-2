Text: "Only three days prior had I decided to just drop everything to go to China\
  \ to study Chinese. Yet four days later, once the plane landed at Beijing International\
  \ did I let out an audible, \"oh shit,\" much to the shock and amusement of my fellow\
  \ passengers. You see, the decision to go was so haphazard and quick that I hadn't\
  \ had the time to think about what it was I was going to do.  But the gravity of\
  \ what I'd done sank in as the 747 pulled into the gate and the seatbelt sign turned\
  \ off. Walking off the plane, I was still in shock. I stopped--midstep--holding\
  \ up the 100 or so other passengers trying to deplane. There I stood, all of 20\
  \ years old, my first time traveling 7000 miles away from home by myself to a foreign\
  \ land-- foreign in every sense of the word. \n\nThings looked different. Really\
  \ different. \"Symbols\" replaced the Latin alphabet I was used to. And of course,\
  \ things \"sounded\" different. Everyone sounded so angry, but in actuality, they\
  \ were all exchanging pleasantries. I would learn more about this in class a bit\
  \ later. Even the cars were a study in opposites: either really old or new, black\
  \ Audi A4s. Nothing in between. Red and green traffic signals didn't seem to mean\
  \ what they did in the West-- they were merely a suggestion. What the fuck had I\
  \ done coming to this seemingly crazy place?! Why, oh, why did I leave everything\
  \ I knew to go traipsing abroad--alone and immature, mind you--in a country that\
  \ bore no resemblance to my own? I quickly answered my own question when I got past\
  \ the initial overwhelm: it's because I was curious about the world, which consists\
  \ of much more than America and English-speaking peoples. Civilizations exist that\
  \ have millennias of history behind them, and I wanted in. I wanted to know. And\
  \ because I've always been fascinated with language,  what better way to be immersed\
  \ than to choose one that is as far from English in scope and scale as could be?\
  \ One, even, with a different writing system! I was curious, all right. A masochist\
  \ is more like it. But I remember from experiences past that I'd never been more\
  \ satisfied than those times when I'd thrown myself to the wolves and had to strategize\
  \ a way to survive. I knew that to be a true citizen of the world, I had to become\
  \ a student of the world first, or so my parents told me, and that's why I did it.\n\
  \nMy first day of school was atypical. Emotions and thoughts ran rampant with no\
  \ rhyme or reason, jumbled together like  toys in a sandbox or the stream of consciousness\
  \ of a James Joyce novel. 'Where's my classroom?' 'What will my classmates be like?'\
  \ 'What are the teachers like?' 'How am I going to learn if \"no English is spoken\
  \ here\"?' Oh, the anxiety. I hadn't been there five minutes and I already needed\
  \ a Valium. And, of course, I was about 10 minutes late due to navigating the bus\
  \ system as an illiterate. It never fails. The students were already introducing\
  \ each other in Chinese by the time I got there--in the first ten fucking minutes!\
  \ So I needed to play catch up-- and quickly--lest I be left behind! Can you tell\
  \ I'm a bit high strung? But I quickly saw that there was nothing to worry about.\
  \ Classmates became friends and teachers became mentors.\n\nI was the only American\
  \ and the only girl. I was also the only black person in the room. But let me tell\
  \ you something: only isn't lonely. It. Is. Awesome. There were only 18 other people\
  \ in my class, from about 16 different countries. A veritable United Nations in\
  \ a room 20 feet square. I was immediately reassured that this would probably be\
  \ the greatest experience of my life and that I'd come out stronger, smarter and\
  \ better for it. And yes, it truly was an experience for the books."
