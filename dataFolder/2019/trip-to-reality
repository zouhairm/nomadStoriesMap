Text: 'Just a few steps away from the nation whom I am advised to hate, or educated
  to, or what not.

  Those few moments, amidst of all the slogans, on front of that proud salute, at
  Hussainiwala Border, Ferozepur, Punjab, this evening made me ask "WHY" ?

  On a weekend getaway, 445 KM, away, to the "City Of Martyrs", land of "Punjab Mata",
  to Ferozepur in Punjab, felt the smell of that soil, strong gaze of those statues,
  scars of those bullets on the history of Ferozepur, India, city where Shaheed-E-Azam
  Bhagat Singh, became immortal, in our memories, in the water of Satluj, which apprently
  has been abstained from flowing into Pakistan.

  While crossing a railway bridge, which used to serve as a railway station back then
  in the lost pages of the story, the wall shuttering the green flag from the orange
  one, didn''t made any difference to the wide green field, the sun might have set
  a little later, a little deeper, may be it was a little more orangish than the days
  back there at busy Delhi.


  This place was calm, after all those crying voices, loud slogans may be, or the
  noises from the heavy artillery, decorating the museum at Hussainiwala Border, which
  closes at 05:00 PM, but a lucky glance and we heard them all.


  Regular parade of the two countries took to some trance and emotions could be seen,
  heard and felt all around the ampitheatre, men in uniform, what proud, of serving
  their mother land, what courage, what roar of the real heroes.


  En route, back to art, with the questions from history, ready to hear the false
  answers, crammed by the society, world.'
