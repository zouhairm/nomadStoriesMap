Text: "Meeting a person that lived during World War II is something difficult. During\
  \ my exchange year in Germany, I stayed at a local family\u2019s house. They were\
  \ all teachers and my mom\u2019s mother lived with us because of old age and because\
  \ she was widowed. I left for school and every day, coming back, I had lunch with\
  \ Oma (Oma means grandma in German). Sometimes I ate with my host sister, but mostly\
  \ I ate with Oma.\n\nOma didn\u2019t speak English, and I didn\u2019t speak german\
  \ well enough to maintain a conversation. That created a language barrier between\
  \ me and her, but we really wanted to talk to each other, we wanted to exchange\
  \ stories and get to know each other. She spoke the region\u2019s dialect which\
  \ was even more complicated than german and that made things more complicated. \n\
  \nWeeks passed, and I started to understand somethings that she was telling me.\
  \ With my weak german, I tried to tell about how my day was and some information\
  \ about where I came from. The conversation started to happen, and everyday was\
  \ an improvement. When we understood each other, we celebrated together, and it\
  \ was something really nice. It was a different way of connecting to a person that\
  \ until now, I can\u2019t explain well enough. It was a rush of excitement, wanting\
  \ to hug her and jumping up and down (we couldn\u2019t do the last one because of\
  \ her age).\n\nAfter some months living in their house and understanding more the\
  \ language, and their ways of life, I remember vividly until today, the day that\
  \ we were having lunch down at her place. We were eating a typical regional soup\
  \ with some potato balls and meat. I normally don\u2019t eat a lot because I am\
  \ short and small, and every time I went there and finished my meals, she always\
  \ offered me more, even If I said, \u201CIch bin sat, danke.\u201D (I am full, thank\
  \ you.).\n\nMy host mom told me later, that she always was like that and never ate\
  \ a lot, because she wanted to leave more food for us, the younger ones. She didn\u2019\
  t need to say no more words. She was like that because of the war. Of what they\u2019\
  ve been trough. Of starving, not having things to wear and when they did, they were\
  \ mostly spoiled. Even if they were germans, they still starved. She didn\u2019\
  t want that for us. She didn\u2019t want us to go through what she went. \n\nThat\
  \ was when I realized that traveling, was much more than learning about the country\
  \ and visiting it\u2019s landmarks and eating the typical food. That was when I\
  \ realized that knowing the language and the country\u2019s people, was much more\
  \ important than taking pictures, because you can connect in a deeper level with\
  \ the natives and learn things that you normally wouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s when\
  \ I learned that I wanted to do this for the rest of my life."
