Text: I hail from mountains of uttarakhand but I was devoid of serene beauty of the
  landscape.i was born and brought up in the city of dreams" Mumbai" where the population
  is around 12 million where people don't have time to travel and explore the places.But
  for me it was different I always want to explore new places and I have been to many
  places down south but didn't find the real peace one day my father told me about
  place where we actually belong from after hearing him I got excited and decided
  to go uttarakhand.than I take flight from Mumbai to Delhi which is near to the uttarakhand
  and rented a bike from Delhi after travel some distance I realise that people are
  very different from the place I come from there language,cloths the way they talk
  in India people believe that every 30km the laguage and culture change.so after
  covering around 100 km I reached haridwar where I decide to take a day off and explore
  the place after checking in into the hotel I decide to take a walk down to the holy
  river ganga where people come from different states to atain inner peace.every evening
  they worship ganga river which is personified god in Indian culture.i decided to
  sit there for sometime and realise difference between the hectic life and I don't
  have the excat word to describe the environment around there and i feel clam and
  relax which I didn't feel in Mumbai after spending some time there I went to my
  hotel and next day I start my journey towards the mountains when you leave the haridwar
  you can see the mountains and snow.when I was driving I saw the trees and breathe
  the fresh air people are not so buzzy they are enjoying what they have here.after
  covering another 150 km I reached the place which my father told me about the lansidowne
  the unknown heaven between the mountains it was cold I reached a lake where people
  are sitting and fishing enjoying the sun light and eating snacks I was there for
  7 days and realise yeah this is the place I want to be.
