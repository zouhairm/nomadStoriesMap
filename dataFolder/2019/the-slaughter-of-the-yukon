Text: "Sunday, February 15, was just like any other winter day in Canada\u2019s Yukon\
  \ territory. The impossible cold had, technically, eased off to -40\xB0C, from the\
  \ previous day\u2019s low of -45\xB0, so life was marginally less intolerable.\n\
  \n\tWe had already been warned by local elders and law enforcement that traversing\
  \ the Yukon, on foot, in the heart of one of the coldest winters on record, was\
  \ a suicide mission. Extreme weather conditions and bloodthirsty wildlife were just\
  \ two of the reasons that even the most seasoned Yukoners branded us some synonym\
  \ of stupid. It was not that we had failed to pay due reverence to doubt, but rather,\
  \ we believed the truest adventure was to be found exactly where life flirts with\
  \ death.\n\t\n\tOnce a cluttered thoroughfare for prospectors during the 1897 gold\
  \ rush, the Old Dawson Trail lay mostly forgotten, haunted only by the spirits of\
  \ those young, opportunistic men and women who perished in the bleak winter on the\
  \ quest for a better life. Since 2003, though, Mother Nature\u2019s not-so-red carpet\
  \ has been rolling out for what is widely regarded as the world\u2019s coldest,\
  \ toughest ultra marathon. A courageous cohort of endurance athletes race, on foot,\
  \ along the 700 km trail from Whitehorse, the territory\u2019s capital, to Dawson\
  \ City.\n\n\tFollowing in the slipstream of such a prominent race meant a packed\
  \ trail; a veritable gift when dragging along a pulk sled laden with more equipment,\
  \ clothing, and supplies than one could possibly need. Though, despite the favourable\
  \ going, Hendrik and I had only recently escaped from our soulless city cages, so\
  \ it would still take some time before we adjusted to life on the snow.\n\t\n\t\u201C\
  Ready?\u201D, I said.\n\n\t\u201CReady!\u201D he replied, smirking as only a Frenchman\
  \ staring down death could.\n\nAnd so we walked, oblivious to the realities of our\
  \ brave new world and the horror to come.\n\n\u2014\n\nIt was sometime in February;\
  \ dates had lost all significance by now. All I knew is that we had been walking\
  \ twelve hours a day for twelve days straight. There was nothing but an infinite\
  \ expanse of white, channeled by spruce trees and subalpine firs. We were utterly\
  \ deprived of our senses. No gushing river nor trickling stream. Not a single scent\
  \ of flora nor any leaves to susurrate in the breeze. Only the scrape of the sleds\
  \ across the ice and our exasperated pants could be heard, as each lunge trailwards\
  \ added further fuel to the fires that were already raging in our thighs.\n\n\t\
  I was lost deep in thought\u2014as the throes of expedition life often demand one\
  \ to be\u2014when I happened to glance up to see a peculiar dark mass on the horizon.\
  \ Peculiar only by virtue of the fact that it wasn\u2019t snow and, for reasons\
  \ unclear, Hendrik was standing mournfully beside it perhaps a kilometre up river.\
  \ As I drew closer, gruesomely morbid details began to emerge. Discarded in a tangled\
  \ heap by the side of the trail were the corpses of countless animals. Perhaps a\
  \ dozen wolves, eight lynx, and over fifty pine martins. Each stripped of every\
  \ inch of fur and skin. Muscle, sinew, and nerve exposed unflinchingly to the harsh\
  \ winter air. Their faces each preserved with the same expression of terror and\
  \ panic that must have been present during their struggle against the snare as,\
  \ with each hopeless yank for freedom, tightened evermore.\n\n\tBowing my head,\
  \ the shock was quickly compounded with shame. \u201CIt\u2019s incredible,\u201D\
  \ I said, \u201Cthat our species can claim responsibility for such gratuitous slaughter.\u201D\
  \n\tThe long contemplative silence that followed was broken by another outburst.\n\
  \u201CThese wild animals were strangled to death, skinned, and had their financially\
  \ worthless bodies dumped indiscriminately, all in the name of fashion.\u201D\n\t\
  An uncomfortable truth began to elbow its way to the front of my mind. A truth that\
  \ I had been reliably ignoring for most of my life. The world does not disappear\
  \ every time I close my eyes. While pursuing adventures beyond our habitual bubble,\
  \ we must ready ourselves for the often harsh and cruel realities of life.\n\n\t\
  Our two-man procession turned soberly away from the mound of frigid carcasses and\
  \ continued onwards to Dawson city."
