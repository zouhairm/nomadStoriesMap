Text: "The land appears behind the immense Estrecho de Magallanes (Strait of Magallanes)\
  \ and the plane turns, in a perfect curve, looking for the runway that awaits below.\
  \ We have arrived in Punta Arenas: south of the south, at the beginning of the end\
  \ of the world. The turbulence of the sky does not disappear in the ground, the\
  \ earth is blackish but the sky of a pale blue is split by the wind, that runs and\
  \ displaces the clouds, and inclines the trees forcing it to stretch its extremities\
  \ away from the trunk. They call them \xC1rboles Bandera (Flag Trees). The city\
  \ rises at will of will against the inclemencies of the climate, the snow used to\
  \ rise by meters on the ground, but now the snow no longer piles up but it freezes\
  \ and displaces by the pavement, turning itself into ice. The falls are constant\
  \ because of this. People weave their lives in a frozen space, different and distant\
  \ from the rest of the country, so they raise their own flag with pride to reinforce\
  \ their uniqueness. Blue, white and yellow. There is a certain independence in them,\
  \ in their ways and forms, but everyone if you look at them and smile, will unravel\
  \ their kidness that comes within. It flows and connects with you and suddenly you\
  \ are no longer a \"Nortina\" (from the North), but a witness of otherness. Thus,\
  \ allowing me to understand them better, they showed me the spaces that make up\
  \ their identity, which allows them to narrate and meet and feel Puntarenenses and\
  \ not Chileans. They showed me all the grays that contains their cultural identity.\
  \ I knew their spaces full of pain, like the torture centers used by the Chilean\
  \ dictatorship, which abound in being an extreme place in the country; as well as\
  \ the place where hope and memory are born, in places of memory and local remembrance,\
  \ that they defend and propose for a Nunca M\xE1s (Never again). They show me, above\
  \ all, the colors of their resilience. So, I continue with them, sinking into their\
  \ streets adjoining the sea, the saline wind running even harder and hitting my\
  \ jacket; in its architecture, peculiar in its diversity, that raises houses that\
  \ resist the snow and the wind and that, as they approach the hill, they lean towards\
  \ the sky; in its gastronomy, with southern and warm food in each place, to combat\
  \ the climate. All those materialities, physical questions, leave the one-dimensionality\
  \ when a voice runs close, or when there are other eyes that observe, when one of\
  \ its citizens tells me, for example, that this or that house is their childhood\
  \ home, that in that school they finished high school, that in this street occured\
  \ the funeral march of their father, that Intendant of a time now retained in the\
  \ past, when he died. Their memories suddenly invite me, envelop me, take me from\
  \ that foreign place to pull me close. The days run, as I would not like, and the\
  \ stones that fold the strait I keep in a small bottle that I will take care of\
  \ later. Thus, the farewell process begins and suddenly I was already on the plane,\
  \ again, waiting for the curve that would elevate us to the north. The colors, however,\
  \ are the first thing I think when I remember Punta Arenas, bluish and pale, crystalline\
  \ by the ice, and immediately, its people and their stories appear. The distant\
  \ place is no longer so distant, and the distance fractures in remembrance. One\
  \ never completely returns from the places we meet, and that is one of the best\
  \ quality they possess."
