Text: "Trying to find the right words to describe such an exciting experience is complicated,\
  \ but I will do my best to give a realist portrait of this adventure. At first I\
  \ have to confess that I have always been fascinated by diffrent cultures and traditions.\
  \ I have studied anthropology in my last years of high school; this subject really\
  \ intresting me, in particular I was captured by the stories of Margaret Mead about\
  \ South Pacific populations and by the research of Franz Boas. Moved by this interest\
  \  and by the desire to enrich my knowledge about other country the last summer\
  \ I decided to go on a journey with a firend of mine in Albania( this friend was\
  \ originally from Albania). We visited several cities and I understood that the\
  \ respect for the tradition and some rituals is essential for the preservation of\
  \ cultural heritage. During the journey one of the most remarkable event was probably\
  \ the knowing of Valdete, a kind and elderly woman that I had met in Kavaje. I remember\
  \ that it was a warm September day when we first met her, me and my friend were\
  \ tired and thirsty after a long morning spent visiting the whole town, walking\
  \ up and down, exploring every corner and covering every remote path.  Exhausted\
  \ we had take a rest in this small caf\xE9, Valdete was the owner, she was probably\
  \ touched by our spent faces so she offred us a typical Albanian dessert, Baklava,\
  \ for those who had never eat it,it taste like a syrup of pure sugar and honey,\
  \ it is one of the sweeter things that I had ever eat. After eating the dessert\
  \ Valdete took a sit next to me, she was staring at me in a curious way, and I similed\
  \ in returned. She had noticed that I was not Albanian; I do not know exactly how\
  \ she had done but after a minute of silence she satrted talking in Italian, like\
  \ she had read on my face my nationality. She told us about the period of her life\
  \ spent in Bari where she had learned several Italian recipes, althought she had\
  \ really enjoyed those years in Italy she had felt the desire to come back to her\
  \ native city. From the way she talked about cooking I understood that it was her\
  \ passion, so I keep on asking her about traditional dishes. She invited us in her\
  \ kitchen to see how to make a real Borek (which is a savoury pie), while she was\
  \ cooking she explained that the first of january they cook Borek and hide between\
  \ the layers of the pie a coin, the one who eat the piece with the coin it is said\
  \ to be the luckiest. Valdete through her passion for food was sharing her origins,\
  \ and was trying to maintain alive ancient tarditions that were passed from generation\
  \ to generation. I had really admire her aspiration, and the love she puts in the\
  \ making of this plate, is like she is telling her stories trhough them. Travel\
  \ and get to know about traditions by people who really lived it, it is priceless.\
  \ I returned back home with the feeling of being grown up as a more complete and\
  \ global person. In a world characterized by constant changes and  process of globalization\
  \ which lead to the progressive disappearence of ethnic traits , trying to preservate\
  \ different culture by writing and teaching about them is a topical issue. If I\
  \ can contribute I would like to share my enthusiasm for travel. One of the things\
  \ that I am certain of is that travel is not only about discovering new places but\
  \ it also get to know new people."
