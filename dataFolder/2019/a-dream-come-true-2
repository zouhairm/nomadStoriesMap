Text: "This is not just a story but one of the best moments of my life. When i got\
  \ selected for the internship at the Taj holiday village resort & spa , goa. It\
  \ all started a year back in december after the christmas , As goa is famous for\
  \ its beaches, festivals and parties . I went a bit earlier to attend the timeout\
  \ festival and yes, it was mind boggling . Its just like what you are dreaming and\
  \ it comes true. I got a tick om my bucket list . Martin garrix was magical . Then\
  \ my friends came later after two days for the training. We started our new year\
  \ by visiting the church at old goa . Then our journey started in the hotel with\
  \ each one working in each department trying to excel and achieve to become better.\
  \ We had spent the best of nights where initially finding the accomodation was a\
  \ very rough task . As it is a peak season and rates were extremely high. Lately\
  \ we managed to buy a villa theough contacts with a stipulated amount . Best part\
  \  was a pool where we gather together to have a cheerful talks , one  heck of a\
  \ nights . During the training we interacted with new people , learn new things\
  \ , also me having interest in kitchen learnt some goan dishes. We went to many\
  \ places when it comes for travelling starting with one  of the best greek restaurant\
  \ thalassa in vagator on friend\u2019s birthday and we five people lit the restaurant\
  \ . Many people came with and danced with us . And yes, I met a beautiful girl from\
  \ portugal which i got a little crush and definitely she was impressed . Then we\
  \ had went to the chapora fort , what an amazing view from the top With sandstones\
  \ , rocks and the beach . The sunset from there was breathtaking . Then the flea\
  \ market in Anjuna. Where most of the items were cheap and quite good . To maintain\
  \ the regular training and enjoying was quite tough . As after the training everybody\
  \ got tired and just wanted to relax. But when we all had beers in our hand and\
  \ share our daily experience at nights. We usually got.more attached. We had an\
  \ annual function in the hotel . Employees were so good . Dance competetion, fashion\
  \ shows . It was all perfect . Yes, there was a time when we faced difficulties\
  \ in transportation , we had walked almost 7-8 kms on regular basis in scorching\
  \ heat . The food of goa really sucks only some of the places were good . Beside\
  \ the shacks which had huge rates . Sea food was damn spicy and hot . The roads\
  \ are very narrow but its feel like you are evolving day by day . As in there is\
  \ no rush of traffic, no pollution , A clear sky and in the night , When you see\
  \ the moon and stars you automatically feels calm. One of the famous tito \u2018\
  s lane in baga beach where almost every club we have been into and enjoyed. We went\
  \ to the  capital ie panjim where there are colurful houses. Then you cannot afford\
  \ to miss the water sports with paragliding , snorkeling amd banana ride and much\
  \ more. And definely if you are fond of gambling visit the Deltin royale cruise\
  \ and live your life to the fullest. With happening interiors , best of food , wines\
  \ and champagnes. The localities were familiar with us . The employees started to\
  \ come to our home and spent the nights with us. Lastly we visited the taj exotica\
  \ hotel in south goa for a two day vacation on leave and i cannot describe what\
  \ we had done. A warm welcome wifh five star facilities. What an irony we were doing\
  \ training at taj and then we are the only guest at different property just a matter\
  \ of time and luck . I truly believe being a food and travel blogger i have passion\
  \ to see different countries visit new people , taste good food and have a good\
  \ shot of some my amazing photography skills not to forget , i am a budding great\
  \ chef as well . \nI hope youhavd enjoyed it."
