Text: "It was four hours into the ten hour drive from Maputo to Inhambane. My butt\
  \ had been numb for the last two of those hours. I was seated next to the overweight\
  \ driver whose heft had been encroaching into my space since hour one. My seat slanted\
  \ downward more than slightly to the right and had no headrest. I had chosen the\
  \ seat with design, reasoning I would have the best views of the countryside during\
  \ the drive. While bugs and dust from the dirt roads increasingly clouded the windshield,\
  \ this reasoning proved true. As the over-crowded, under-serviced bus rumbled up\
  \ the coast, we passed vast expanses of tropical growth, interspersed with the occasional\
  \ fruit stand, brightly colored shops made of corrugated iron selling airtime and\
  \ Chupa Chip lollipops, and construction sites with Chinese-funded bulldozers. We\
  \ stopped during hour five at a gas station. Its shiny, white pillars looked out\
  \ of place in the lush, green jungle but it had a toilet so I brushed aside the\
  \ idiosyncrasy of it. \n\nI climbed back into the bus and my fellow front seat passenger\
  \ in the three seater jumped in a minute later. He opened up his black, plastic\
  \ bag and snapped a beer out of the plastic rings. I glanced over, jealously coveting\
  \ his cold 2M. It was 95 degrees outside and the air from the driver\u2019s halfway\
  \ cracked window only brought in more humidity. The passenger noticed my stares.\n\
  \n\u201CVoc\xEA gostaria de um?\u201D he asked.\n\n\u201CEu nao falo portugues\u2026\
  \u201D I said with a shrug and a deep sense of embarrassment over my accent. \n\n\
  \u201CWould you like one?\u201D he asked again. \n\n\u201CAre you sure?\u201D\n\n\
  \u201COf course!\u201D he called out as he reached into the bag, wiping off the\
  \ cold condensation from the 2M. \n \nI cracked open the beer as I continued to\
  \ watch the scenery pass by. The bus made a turn and revealed the coast line. The\
  \ palm trees and African flame trees gave way to sand and the cerulean Indian Ocean.\
  \ I brought my beer down to my lap and simply watched the water until the bus turned\
  \ again and the view was obscured. \n\n\u201CHave you ever been to Mozambique before?\u201D\
  \ he asked.\n\n\u201CNo. It\u2019s my first time! It\u2019s so beautiful!\u201D\
  \ I replied excitedly. \n\n\u201CIt is beautiful.\u201D \n\nHis name was Francesco.\
  \ He lived in Maputo and was going to Cumbana where his mother and younger brother\
  \ ran a shop in the main market place. He had moved to Maputo 20 years ago. He had\
  \ done this drive more times then he could count and was amused by my sense of wonder\
  \ at the surroundings. \n\nFrancesco was born in a small village outside Tete during\
  \ the middle of the civil war. His father had been a soldier fighting for FRELIMO\
  \ and had been killed in 1987. Two of his sisters had disappeared during a RENAMO\
  \ raid of their village shortly after that. Francesco had moved to Maputo after\
  \ the war ended to try to find a job so he could support his family. He found work\
  \ as a fisherman. He told me how much the country had changed in the last few years.\n\
  \n\u201CThere are more paved roads, more things to buy on grocery store shelves,\
  \ and more tourists,\u201D he winked at me as he said the last one. \n\n\u201CCome\
  \ fishing with me when you get back to Maputo!\u201D he declared as the bus pulled\
  \ up to Cumbana. \n\nHe gave me his phone number and one more 2M before he climbed\
  \ out of the bus. I watched as he disappeared into the marketplace. \n\nI turned\
  \ back toward the road and continued to sip my beer as the bus trundled on toward\
  \ Inhambane."
