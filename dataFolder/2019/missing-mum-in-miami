Text: "My mother was a miracle. She had been battling an aggressive form of liver\
  \ cancer for five years when I informed her that I wanted to book a flight to Miami\
  \ but was unsure how to proceed. The unpredictability of her illness led to chronic\
  \ indecision, but here she was, a pure smile on her face, urging me to take the\
  \ trip. My mum passed away on January 20th and had always told me that she would\
  \ be on my shoulder whenever I needed her.\n\n\u201CWhen you go on your adventures,\
  \ I feel like I\u2019m going with you\u201D, that was her blessing to go out into\
  \ the world and explore, the sweetest affirmation I had ever heard. I remember boarding\
  \ the flight, putting my right hand on my left shoulder, and giving it a gentle\
  \ squeeze. I wasn\u2019t alone on this trip.\n\nThe sweet synthetic sultriness of\
  \ Miami opened her arms to me, and I spent weepy, happy, raw days exploring. The\
  \ memories I was forming were bittersweet and I felt like an exposed live-wire,\
  \ soaking up the sea, the soft sand and the salty air, taking in the vibrant lights\
  \ of the Ocean Drive Strip with their \u2018come-hither\u2019 posturing juxtaposed\
  \ almost offensively against the straight line where the sea hit the land. I lost\
  \ myself in platefuls of food, delicious flautas and mouth-watering mahi-mahi. I\
  \ threw myself with abandon into making connections with other people, as delicate\
  \ as I was emotionally, I understood in deeper detail how important true connection\
  \ is to our happiness. I felt what good travel always manages to make me feel, truly\
  \ alive, my pulse synchronised to some fundamental truth of life. \n\nIt was in\
  \ a car, passenger side, driving down a long road flanked with palm trees, belly\
  \ full of tacos, that I wound down my window and felt the wind push in. Adventure\
  \ is like that. All it takes is for someone to open the window and let the experience\
  \ flood in, and just like that, it drenches your senses totally. \n\nThere is no\
  \ \u2018right\u2019 time to have an adventure. You don\u2019t pursue adventure,\
  \ adventure pursues you. It starts as a gnawing ache inside to have an experience,\
  \ and it becomes so massive and so insistent, that it is impossible to ignore. It\
  \ was on this adventure, through the swamps, beaches and grand national and state\
  \ parks of Florida that I began to understand the intensity of my grief. My mum\
  \ had always encouraged my sense of adventure, she helped foster it back in my childhood\
  \ when we spent sun-drenched summers in Cyprus. I could honour her memory by continuing\
  \ to sail off into sunsets, to embrace the wild road of the explorer. \n\nGrief\
  \ strips you of your innocence, it makes you see the world through sand-gritted\
  \ eyes rather than rose-tinted glasses, but travel restores curiosity, faith, hope\
  \ and a belief in miracles. It was here that I took my first step towards healing,\
  \ a voyage that will be ongoing throughout my life. I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ peace on the road, but peace settles on you at random times, much like a butterfly\
  \ that will disappear as soon as you stop to acknowledge it, and ironically it tends\
  \ to appear when you are in motion. \n\n\u201CAre you okay? You\u2019ve been quiet\
  \ for a while\u201D, my driver companion asked, big blue eyes the picture of concern.\
  \ \n\nI turned to him with tears in my eyes and smiled. \n\n\"I'll be okay.\""
