Text: "There is a disclaimer that says anyone with back/knee problems or claustrophobia\
  \ shouldn\u2019t take the journey inside The Great Pyramid of Giza. I knew about\
  \ this disclaimer before I left for Egypt. I knew about it when I got to Egypt.\
  \ Our tour guide, Ahmed, reminded us of it that Sunday morning as our van pulled\
  \ into the parking lot, with the last remaining wonder of the ancient world standing\
  \ as his stoic backdrop against a cloudless sky. \n\nI texted my Egyptian friend\
  \ back in Canada and said I wasn\u2019t going inside. \u201CYou go all the way to\
  \ Egypt and you don\u2019t go in the pyramid? Go in!\u201D He wisely responded.\
  \ I thought about it for a moment. I knew he was right. But still, I hesitated.\n\
  \nI asked Ahmed if I would get stuck. He laughed. \u201CNo, of course not!\u201D\
  \ He collected everyone\u2019s money for the tickets and smirked at me. \u201CSo,\
  \ are you going inside?\u201D I took a deep breath and glanced down at the text-exchange\
  \ on my phone. I looked up at the pyramids. I dreamt about Egypt since high school.\
  \ I never thought I\u2019d be here. Now, the pyramids stand before me and I\u2019\
  m chickening out. Classic me. \n\nMy back and knees were fine. I couldn\u2019t use\
  \ that as an excuse. My genuine fear of getting stuck like Winnie The Pooh would\
  \ just have to be dealt with. I came all this way. I had to go in.\n\nInside the\
  \ pyramid, I quickly realized the disclaimer was no joke. The Ascending Passageway\
  \ is hot and steep and tiny. I crouched down into the passageway and slowly crept\
  \ up its long, narrow staircase. A row of adventurers crouched and waddled along\
  \ in front of me. More followed behind me. Another group inched their way back down\
  \ next to us. We all squished together in a slim space that wasn\u2019t exactly\
  \ built for curious tourists, let alone two lanes of foot traffic. I was in this\
  \ for good now. I wanted to turn back, but I couldn\u2019t. In that moment, it was\
  \ impossible.  \n\nI struggled to maintain my balance several times. My back started\
  \ to cramp. I didn\u2019t realize there would be so much crouch-waddling. The urge\
  \ to stand for just a second and take a quick stretch was intense, but there was\
  \ no room. I had to keep going. The air grew hotter and stuffier the higher we went.\
  \ Sweat poured down my cheeks. I gulped the water I wisely brought with me. I huffed\
  \ this dense air and told myself I could do this. Still, my head felt light and\
  \ I feared I would pass out. The tiny space. The people. The lack of oxygen. It\
  \ was getting to me. I was scared. I wanted to open a window so bad and then remembered,\
  \ \u201COh yeah. It's a pyramid.\u201D \n\nI did the only thing I could do: Keep\
  \ walking.\n\nWhat felt like a century in claustrophobia years, was probably only\
  \ a few minutes. We made it out of the passageway and into the Grand Gallery: an\
  \ open space with high ceilings and plenty of wiggle room. I stood up. I stretched.\
  \ I could breathe. I felt like Indiana Jones. I was ready for anything now and eager\
  \ to move forward. Another tiny area ahead surprised us. I groaned, got into crawling\
  \ position and went for it. Before I knew it, I was finally standing upright in\
  \ our end goal: The King\u2019s Chamber. \n\nThe chamber itself is dark. There isn\u2019\
  t much to see. No hieroglyphics or intricately carved statues like in other temples\
  \ and tombs in Egypt. A small fluorescent light situated in the corner casted a\
  \ ghastly hue on us. I didn\u2019t care. I was here. \n\nI placed my hand on the\
  \ smooth stone wall and closed my eyes. A sense of calm took over. I collected my\
  \ thoughts. \"I\u2019m in Egypt. I\u2019m standing in the King\u2019s Chamber of\
  \ The Great Pyramid of Giza. Life is good.\"\n\nWe each had our moments and made\
  \ our way back down the pyramid. Everything felt easy now.\n\n\"You did it!\" Ahmed\
  \ said when we got outside. Yup. I did. Who knew? The claustrophobic Canadian didn\u2019\
  t pass out."
