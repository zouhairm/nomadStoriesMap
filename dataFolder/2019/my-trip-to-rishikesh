Text: "\u201CNot all those who wander are lost.\u201D   This famous quote by J. R.\
  \ R. Tolkien pretty much summarizes a nomad\u2019s life. Even if the wanders are\
  \ lost they knows they are going to find a way much better than the one they are\
  \ already walking in.Thats how at least I would like to describe my travel experiences,\
  \ sometimes to get lost sometimes to be awaken again.\nOut of my various travels\
  \ inside and out of India the one I will cherish for my life will definitely be\
  \ the Trip to Rishikesh.Though I was born near Rishikesh and lived here most of\
  \ my life but I get the taste of the city only few years back. When I first travelled\
  \ to the city I was just blown away by the kind of energy the city has. This is\
  \ the place where Ganges River spills out of the foothills of the Himalayas for\
  \ the first time and begins her long journey across the plains of India to be finally\
  \ merging into the Bay of Bengal.\nRiver Ganges here is as calm as if there is nothing\
  \ to worry about in the world, soaking away all the negative energies from you.\
  \ With so many energies around, it makes you wonder if a place like this actually\
  \ exists. Only in one road of hardly 1 mile one can hear more than 20+ languages\
  \ from across the world be it French , German, Hebrew, Chinese, English, Hindi,\
  \ Garhwali, Japanese, Spanish, Bengali, Portuguese, Quechua so on and so forth.\n\
  The city because of the meditation / yoga hub it has become has a different kind\
  \ of simplicity within itself. Not only it is very well connected to the nature\
  \ but also it makes one feels like a part of the bigger world, a world much bigger\
  \ than the one we are already living in.\n\nIf we go by the quote of Roy M. Goodman\
  \ - \u201CRemember that happiness is a way of travel \u2013 not a destination.\u201D\
  \ Then definitely a trip to Rishikesh is worth making.\nI am not a religious / spiritual\
  \ person and maybe that\u2019s the reason it took me long to set foot in Rishikesh\
  \ but once you enter here the idea of one\u2019s religious identity and spirituality\
  \ got blurred. If one\u2019 goal of travelling is only to learn than any place can\
  \ serve as a master after all we are all and remain a student in front of this world\
  \ /universe /nature throughout our life.\nRishikesh the place which not only awakens\
  \ one\u2019s outer self but also helps to find the inner self of oneself which we\
  \ may be losing in today\u2019s hustle bustle of life.\nYou do have Neer waterfall,\
  \ Patna waterfall, the Ganges and other natural destination to feed the nature thrust\
  \ in check for the nomads inside you also meeting new, different and alike people\
  \ will keep the human side within you active.\nRishikesh is not your typical travel\
  \ destination though it does have places to see like Laxman jhula, Ram jhula, ashrams\
  \ and waterfalls but it\u2019s the energy here which makes the place so unique.\
  \ Adventure enthusiast can enjoy activities like hiking, White River rafting and\
  \ Bungee jumping here.\nNot only is the air ,water and sun three elements of life\
  \ are purer here but also the people seems much more relaxed and one couldn\u2019\
  t help but lost into this sanity of life which is so rare to find otherwise.\nThough\
  \ Rishikesh is small city but the best parts to travel around here is near Laxman\
  \ jhula and Tapovan.This place itself has so many secret beaches that the Columbus\
  \ in you will quest to explore more though the reasons / motives would be entirely\
  \ different.\nSpirituality is a way of life in Rishikesh rather than the other way\
  \ round with the beautiful sunsets adding his own charm into this amazing aura leaving\
  \ you speechless.\nIt is easy to leave the place physically but even after leaving\
  \ you will find your soul somewhere wandering here so doesn\u2019t be surprised\
  \ if this travelogue looks more like a promotion to the city. This is how you feel\
  \ like after after leaving this beauty on earth."
