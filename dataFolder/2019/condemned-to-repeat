Text: "Anzac Cove is a quiet and serene place. Lush grass blankets the ground between\
  \ two memorial walls while mountainous terrain shelters the clearing. Gentle waves\
  \ fall onto the pebbled shore in a quiet rhythm. Cicadas hum a simple melody.\n\n\
  Little red clusters of flowers are splattered across the grass. I pick a red poppy\
  \ and twirl it between my fingers. I have seen poppies immortalised on pins, brooches\
  \ and war memorials since I was little as a symbol of peace, hope and remembrance,\
  \ but this was my first live, grown-in-the-ground poppy.\n\nI sit on the grass,\
  \ overlooking the water. I imagine echoes of rifles and cannons showering men with\
  \ dirty, metallic rain. Khaki figures running, stumbling, dying up the hill. Voices\
  \ shouting, grunting, crying out. I weep, overcome with a sadness that transcends\
  \ a century. I weep for people I don\u2019t know, nor have any familial connection\
  \ to.\n\nMany men who fought here first stepped on foreign soil when they jumped\
  \ off their boats onto this pebbled shore, armed with rifle and bayonet. For many,\
  \ this foreign land would become their final resting place. \n\nI walk through a\
  \ forest of white gravestones, laid in neat, militaristic rows, as if they stood\
  \ at attention, even in death. Towering obelisk and cross-shaped memorials bear\
  \ the biblical quote \u201Ctheir name liveth for evermore.\u201D White marble is\
  \ the only breadcrumb of the bloody war that was fought on this peninsula. \n\n\n\
  Much of the area has become a shrine to the Australian and New Zealand soldiers\
  \ who fought here. Anzac Cove was once named Gaba Tepe, now bearing the name of\
  \ the Allied soldiers. Lone Pine, which once had a Turkish name, has now been lost\
  \ to the famous battle. Turkey was changed, just as the Australian and New Zealand\
  \ nations were changed. \n\nGallipoli is a place of remembrance; a home away from\
  \ home. We are lucky to be welcomed into this former enemy land, where the people\
  \ speak an unfamiliar language and follow the melodic Call to Prayer. We can stand\
  \ in front of the Christian crosses and gravestones, remembering our fallen. We\
  \ can hold services on this land in honour of our country people and hear the sombre\
  \ tones of the lone trumpet playing the Last Post.  \n\nHigh upon the hill stands\
  \ a poised and solemn statue of Mustapha Ataturk, overlooking the entire Gallipoli\
  \ Peninsula. In wartime he oversaw the Turkish war effort. Seventy thousand Turks\
  \ died for victory; died protecting their homeland. Today he guards the Turks and\
  \ allies alike, who rest side by side like comrades.\n\nWithout memorials, medals\
  \ and marches, these men might be forgotten from collective memory. Their very existence\
  \ absorbed by the earth; their blood washed away by rain; their names disappearing\
  \ from living memory with the passing of aging comrades.\n\nMaybe one day we\u2019\
  ll be able to visit battlefields in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. We won\u2019t talk\
  \ about civilian casualties and displaced people. Instead we\u2019ll talk about\
  \ bravery and courage, camaraderie and unity. Maybe memorials and plaques will immortalise\
  \ the names of those who died there.\n\nWar is painted as an honourable endeavour,\
  \ basted in admirable attributes, trivialising the new, innovative and horrific\
  \ ways a war is waged. Important men in suits declare wars and give unimportant\
  \ men a gun with a license to use it. Thou shalt not kill except in war.\n\nWhen\
  \ the war is won these same important men emphatically preach peace and progress\
  \ for humanity, claiming victory for all on the winning side. But there are few\
  \ winners in war. \n\nOne day, will we learn from history? Or will we continue our\
  \ pilgrimages to faraway lands to pay our respects to our long-gone country people\
  \ while we send our living to die fighting a new enemy?\n\nWe can learn history,\
  \ but we are always condemned to repeat it."
