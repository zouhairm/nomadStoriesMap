Text: "The fourth week was beginning, as always the first thing I had done was to\
  \ watch my phone. I took a moment and then I noticed I didn\u2019t wake up due to\
  \ the alarm clock but for the light all around  the room, altough the window was\
  \ for apart covered. I remember I started smiling because I had realized that day\
  \ was the first, from a long time, with the sun in the Northen Ireland and I knew\
  \ It would be special. Also now I can feel how much I was looking for the journey.\
  \ \nAnyway, I had just finished my routine when the house, where I had to stay for\
  \ the following two months, was becoming live. I liked that house, It was the typical\
  \ Irish and I shared it with other students both Italian and foreigner. \nGoing\
  \ forward, I greeted others student who were already woke up and I went out. The\
  \ lucky that journey was that the city was light it all up by the orange colour\
  \ of the sunrise and that time was a pleasure walking through the heart of the city.\
  \  \nIt\u2019s good to know my job, got for all the period in that country, was\
  \ far and I needed to take the bus. The stops was in front of a build in the centre\
  \ of the city. It being divided in two parts used for different purpouses. The first\
  \ as bar, infact the floor at level of the path was used for breakfast at the morning.\
  \ Upstairs is used like a hotel there were room especially for travellers. The point\
  \ of all the story is that. \nAlthough it passed a month from my departure, I can\
  \ forget how much I was still suffering the distance from parents and friends. I\
  \ thought the fault was the sight of the travellers who every day arrived and left\
  \ the hotel while I was waiting the bus. I didn\u2019t thought It was so powerful.\
  \ Instead my body showed it with wet and a little bit red eyes since the beginning.\
  \ Luckly I found someone with whom I made a bound really special. From the first\
  \ day, when I had gone to the workplacement,  at the entrance I had to check the\
  \ in and out for the school there. So every day there were three woman that waited\
  \ me for it. At the first everything gone well. During the time my emotion get out\
  \ and that bring the woman to asked me if it was ok and I was feeling well, I though\
  \ they were worrying. Later the receptionist also started  asking about my family\
  \ and friends not to got information but for other. Then I realized they were looking\
  \ after me. \nThey will remain forever as the person who support me during the sad\
  \ and the worst moment of the experience. We become so close that we knew all about\
  \ each other. Our bound was really strong since they seems my parents and friends\
  \ at the same time.\nThe best thing I will never forget was about my birthday. I\
  \ thought it would have been nice if I had brought something to eat for having fun\
  \ with the guys at the work and with the recepnionist. So, almost a week earlier\
  \ I talked them about my idea. If I colud bring at work some sweet to have fun together.\
  \ They said me there were no problems and sometimes happened the same. To be polite\
  \ I asked to each what sweet they preferred or liked the most. They said me their\
  \ taste and the day of my birthday I bought along the steet for catching the bus\
  \ a box full of different sweet. They were shocked and I offered them what I had\
  \ brought. They kindly said they were following a diet and they didn\u2019t eat\
  \ nothing. I put most of my care for that and they made me a little bit sad. Instead\
  \ for saying me thanks of that they during the day they bought made me a surprise\
  \ a little present for me and a pleasure letter with they wrote some lovely  words\
  \ for the day."
