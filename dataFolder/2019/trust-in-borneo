Text: "You know you can trust someone when you are happy to follow them into a rainforest\
  \ at night. That is where I had gotten to in my relationships with the rangers at\
  \ Sepilok. I have some very conflicted feelings about volunteer tourism after spending\
  \ three months in Borneo taking part in Orangutan Rehabilitation. The one thing\
  \ I am not conflicted about is the friendships I made there. The length of time\
  \ and the types of activities we were expected to participate in trust was a natural\
  \ by-product. In my opinion, the strongest foundations for those relationships come\
  \ out of humour and shared experiences. \nBut that is where our relationships are\
  \ at, following Gabili into a rainforest at night. Sure we all had head-torches\
  \ that blind one another each time you go to answer a question. Rapid bright light\
  \ and then immediate darkness was hard on the eyes. Trust was imperative. Gabili\
  \ gave direction to be quiet and listened. The insects in this part of the world\
  \ could be deafening. I\u2019m sure there were more then I could name, various species\
  \ of cricket and katydids. But the one that stood out was the cicada. Now I am Australian.\
  \ I have lived through many an Australian summer listening to the cicada and have\
  \ never heard anything like this. The combination of the density of the rainforest\
  \ and no artificial sound leaking into our aural periphery gave the cicada a stage\
  \ to perform on. Perform they did just not for us. Exploring something alone is\
  \ a marvelously empowering thing, but going with someone who actually has the knowledge\
  \ to share, has an equally powerful effect. As we listen to what sounded like a\
  \ chainsaw cutting through hardwood and a squeaking door you wouldn\u2019t be blamed\
  \ for mistaking it for a horror movie soundtrack. Gabili offered his knowledge graciously\
  \ of the different sounds made by the different sexes. And, that the chainsaw noise\
  \ was the male attempting to attract a female. \nGabili wasn\u2019t the only one\
  \ to offer up knowledge, he was the only one who did so in earnest. Rosli and James\
  \ conversed with us often about interesting facts. We had over the last week, having\
  \ been trapped inside due to monsoon rains, built a lively rapport. Perhaps the\
  \ resulting humourous relationships had to do with their English not being as fluent\
  \ as Gabili\u2019s or perhaps it was just there personality.  During our days on\
  \ the husbandry rotation, they stood with us as we watched our first hornbills flying\
  \ overhead, letting loose their distinctive call. We asked confirming with them\
  \ that they were in fact hornbills. \n\u201CHornbills?\u201D Rosli pointed to the\
  \ sky \u201CNo they are chickens\u201D Rosli replied, James, joining him in laughter\
  \ and then us bringing up the rear.  \n\u201CSome people think that Hornbills sound\
  \ like a person laughing.\u201D \nRosli smiled a knowing smile at me \"You sound\
  \ like a hornbill.\" He then proceeded it imitate my laugh. This became a running\
  \ joke between my volunteer group and many of the rangers. If a hornbill flew overhead\
  \ while Rosli and I were in the same area he would laugh and point. I heard from\
  \ another volunteer group that once when trekking through the rainforest they heard\
  \ laughter in the distance. Gabili who was leading them sighed, laughed and shook\
  \ his head \u201CAh Jess. Hornbill\u201D\nThese fond relationships we had with Rosli\
  \ and James did come in handy when we were approached by a number of wild orangutans.\
  \ We had been warned about a number of the semi-wild orangutans that could be unpredictable\
  \ and vicious. Being back into a corner by a large and overbearing primate can be\
  \ scary. Having trust in people we worked with a necessity. Having another volunteer\
  \ use your body as a shield, terrifying, aggravating and cemented distrust. I don\u2019\
  t think I have ever screamed someone name so loudly or laughed so hard about the\
  \ solution. Turns the best defense against a large orangutan is a jug of milk. And\
  \ the best defense against allowing your body to give in to aggression and angry\
  \ is laughter."
