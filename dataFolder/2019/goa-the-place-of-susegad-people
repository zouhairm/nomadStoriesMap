Text: "Started my journey to Goa \U0001F60D from Surat \"the city of bridge\" & \"\
  the Diamond city\" it cold night, and yes as like a tradition of Indian family my\
  \ mother came to drop at the railway station & along with my friend, if you are\
  \ Indian then you have always listen one famous dailogue \"Raste me koi kuch de\
  \ to lena mat\" well yes it shows there concern towards us. As i was travelling\
  \ alone to Goa, and that too for an interview but \"Interview to bahana hai Goa\
  \ jo jana tha\" \U0001F605 I boarded myself in Rajdhani express at 12.20 am and\
  \ I reached thivim around 1.30 in the noon, from thivim had to stand in a long queue\
  \ to get chance of booking taxi from taxi stand just outside the station. It took\
  \ 650 Indian rupees to my hotel in Betim, Panjim from Thivim railway station.\n\
  As soon i reached the hotel, my ooo my what a scene from my room \U0001F60D just\
  \ like i dreamt, as soon i open my room's door i get a view to die for, view of\
  \ water and sunset \U0001F60D thank you Mandovi Riverfront hotel by ben hospitalities\
  \ for great hospitality. On the day of arrival i did nothing but relaxed myself\
  \ by having a chilled beer on my beach chair and enjoyed sunset. How can you forget\
  \ of food ? Come onn Goa me aaye aur seafood nai khaya to kya kiya ?\nHad king fish\
  \ with rawa fry \U0001F60D in my dinner, what an awesome dish must try for sea food\
  \ lovers.\n\nNote :- Travelling by taxi might cost high so you have option of public\
  \ bus as well there but you need to search and wait for it.\n\nAfter experiencing\
  \ awesome view from the room i thought of exploring Goa, I called my friend from\
  \ Goa who took me on bike to show places, the question was asked to me \"you want\
  \ to see noisy place or peace giving place ?\"\nI answered loudly yes of course,\
  \ the place where i can have peace, person who comes from surat, who experience\
  \ hell lot of noise and chaos will definitely need the place to relax. I travelled\
  \ to Miramar beach, Dona paula, st. lawrence martyr church, Vasco-da- cama, Japanese\
  \ garden. Must visit Japanese garden, you will get ultimate peace of mind there.\
  \ And i also did the public bus experience there, i travelled from vasco to panjim\
  \ in bus only in 20 rupees. On other hand taxi would cost me over 1000 rupees. I\
  \ reached again in hotel in evening before the sunset and captured it on my Go pro\
  \ hero 7 \U0001F60D what an awesome view !!! Soon after had seafood again in dinner\
  \ got asleep.\n\nThe day was arrived for what i came for, the day of Interview i\
  \ was nervous at start but prepared myself and as the venue was 10 min from my hotel\
  \ i took first a free ferry to other side of river and walked to the venue for 5\
  \ mins. Walked out of interview with a smiling face and hoping for the positive\
  \ reply. And then i headed towards to hotel had my lunch and stayed in hotel for\
  \ rest of the day and planned to go mumbai tomorrow morning. Did all the packing\
  \ in evening. And before that had the very famous kaju feni of goa with limca, what\
  \ a taste man, must try once you are in goa.\nTravelled to thivim railway station\
  \ by taxi to get a train to mumbai. Well the journey of goa was awesome and even\
  \ travelling alone is treat. Enjoyed alot with the hospitality of the hotel and\
  \ the people over there and it is rightly said \"people of goa are Susegad(A relaxed,\
  \ carefree attitude)\_\""
