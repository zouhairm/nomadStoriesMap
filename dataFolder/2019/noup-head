Text: "We trudge up the hill towards the Noup Head Nature Reserve cliffs of Westray\
  \ Island. Led by Graham, a full-bellied and reserved Scot who communicates his knowledge\
  \ of and love for the island in a deep-timbred brogue, we have come to see the birds.\
  \ Cold mist condenses on my olive raincoat as we move forward into the white.  I\
  \ have my doubts that we\u2019ll see much in this murky fog. At last the squelchy\
  \ green grass yields to rock and the muted landscape is abruptly torn away, leaving\
  \ an eerie gray-white curtain and a disorienting sense of no bottom. The surf booms\
  \ distantly at the base of the nearly 300-foot cliffs. This sound is overlaid by\
  \ an unremitting cacophony that fills the air as tens of thousands of kittiwakes,\
  \ puffins, fulmars, razorbills, guillemots, and gannets have their say. \n\nThere\
  \ is so much activity in this place. Birds swoop in and out of the opaque mist,\
  \ sometimes emerging startlingly close. I can almost feel their wingbeats, and their\
  \ abrupt flybys make me suddenly want to sit down.\n\nI detest heights but am drawn\
  \ to the edge. Carefully, I settle on a triangular outcropping covered in brilliant\
  \ marigold lichen, and very close to the edge. I inhale the damp mist and immerse\
  \ myself in the scene. My senses are filled with the salty, seaweed, birdshit sting\
  \ in my nostrils; the brisk, water-dappled breeze slapping my skin; the whir of\
  \ wings, the multi-layered language of birds, and the distant thunder of waves on\
  \ rock. The gauzy fog curtain parts, closes, thickens, and opens again, revealing\
  \ angular, striated brown and gray rock below with birds and nests stuffed into\
  \ every crevice. It is a pageant of avian industry and motion as birds launch, land,\
  \ and play on the winds. This place is incredibly alive and full of wild energy.\
  \  I revel in it. \n\nThe cloaking fog brings magic and mystery to the moment and\
  \ transports me to a primal place. I feel as if I am experiencing Scotland as it\
  \ must have been hundreds of years ago, uninterrupted by the unrelenting grinding\
  \ of gears of modern life. I am grateful for the shroud, and taken aback by the\
  \ profound connection I feel with this place. I am bound to the cliffs, moors, crofts,\
  \ peat bogs, kirks, lochs, brochs, and standing stones of Northern Scotland in a\
  \ way that is deeper than I can comprehend. There is an intangible magic here that\
  \ resonates in my every cell.\n\nWe spent ten days in Orkney and Shetland, and I\
  \ was loathe to leave each location that we visited. There was never time enough,\
  \ to be still enough, to tap into the essence of what called to me. Even now Scotland\
  \ beckons me.  I long to return."
