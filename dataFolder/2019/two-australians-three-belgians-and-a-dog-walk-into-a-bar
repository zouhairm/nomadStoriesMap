Text: "Two Australians, three Belgians and a dog walk into a bar \u2026\n \nIt was\
  \ all planned. We would fly into London and spend a heady two days there. Then,\
  \ to Amsterdam for a night before embarking on a cruise down the Rhine on a luxury\
  \ river ship, complete with fairytale castles and spectacular scenery. And then,\
  \ the big finish in \u2026 Brussels.\n \nYes, Brussels. We were flying out of Brussels,\
  \ I explained to my now-not-so-enthralled audience.  Yes, I had been to Brussels\
  \ before, it was \u2013 great. Yes, I know what Noel Gallagher from Oasis said about\
  \ Brussels. No, I didn\u2019t think the same. Yes I was really looking forward to\
  \ it.\n \nOK, I wasn\u2019t exactly looking forward to it. There were so many places\
  \ I hadn\u2019t been to in Europe that started with B, like Berlin and Budapest\
  \ and Bucharest and Barcelona where I would much rather spend my last weekend. And\
  \ they all had international airports, as far as I knew.\n \n\u201CIt\u2019ll be\
  \ fun,\u201D said my companion. \u201CBrussels has fries with mayonnaise, remember?\
  \ And mussels. You LOVE mussels. And the best chocolate in the world. And the beer\
  \ is amazing. Plus, we can catch up with my friend Lina. She\u2019s great fun. She\u2019\
  s married now, and has a baby, but she will still be fun. It will be nice to meet\
  \ her and her wife.\u201D\n \nSuddenly Brussels \u2013  home to a fun local with\
  \ her new baby and wife (Belgium was the second country in the world after The Netherlands\
  \ to legalise same sex marriage) \u2013 didn\u2019t sound so boring after all. And\
  \ my companion was right. I LOVED mussels. And fries with mayonnaise? The best.\
  \ Belgian chocolate \u2013 better than the best! And amazing beer? Brussels sounded\
  \ great.\n \nWe arranged to meet Lina that evening. She was thrilled to be catching\
  \ up, and looking forward to a great night out. We were going to sample some of\
  \ Belgium\u2019s finest beers, have dinner, and then head to some funky bars for\
  \ cocktails. And a nightclub maybe too.\n \nIt was 3 degrees when we headed out\
  \ to the dazzling Grand Square, still lit up with Christmas lights, the huge Christmas\
  \ tree and famous Christmas markets drawing a large crowd of evening revellers (and\
  \ pickpockets as I discovered later when I turned out my pockets looking for my\
  \ hotel keycard). As promised, Lina was lovely and funny and fun. She introduced\
  \ us to Elise, a serious, clear-eyed 6-month-old rugged up tight in her pram. Soon\
  \ after, Lina\u2019s wife Astrid, accompanied by Fred, their fox terrier, turned\
  \ up as well.\n \nBeing from Australia, I assumed that Astrid was coming to say\
  \ hello, and would then take the baby and dog home, so Lina could head to the bar\
  \ and have her great night out.\n \nBut this was Belgium. Apparently Astrid and\
  \ the baby (and the dog) were coming to have a great night out too.\n \nWe found\
  \ a chic, noisy, crowded bar with seriously fresh beer on tap. Lina pushed the pram\
  \ in. Astrid and the dog strolled in comfortably after. We found a table. The baby\
  \ was propped up on one lap. The dog was propped up on another lap.\n \nI was astonished.\
  \ \u201CYou can really bring a dog into a bar?\u201D\n \n\u201CYes of course!\u201D\
  \ said Astrid. \u201CYou can\u2019t in Australia?\u201D\n \nIn Australia \u2013\
  \ that laid-back, happy-go-lucky, casual \u2018she\u2019ll be right\u2019 country\
  \ \u2013 you definitely could not bring a dog into a bar.\n \nNext stop was dinner.\
  \ Once again, pram, baby and dog were comfortably installed, though the dog stayed\
  \ under the table this time, happily accepting the odd portion of Flemish Carbonnade.\
  \ Another dog walked in too \u2013 this one the size of a Shetland pony. The only\
  \ person who reacted was me. Even when Fred pissed on the carpet at the front of\
  \ the restaurant, the staff just laughed. It was easily cleaned up, they said.\n\
  \ \nBack home, I had to confess that Brussels was actually one of the highlights\
  \ of the trip. The beer, the bars, the food, the shopping, the museum, the art galleries\
  \ and super friendly people made it a weekend whirlwind of culture and fun.\n \n\
  And being able to bring your dog into a restaurant or bar? The absolute best!"
