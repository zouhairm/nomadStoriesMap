Text: "It was 0200 pm and We (Me and my wife) were still undecided on our weekend.\
  \ An adventure trip on our scooty was the only thing figured out so far. Travelling\
  \ is often exciting when it\u2019s unplanned, so was our decision for a trip to\
  \ Bhangarh Fort (One of Asia's most haunted fort), as it has all the elements of\
  \ adventure:\n\n\u2022\tLong drive (Jaipur to Bhangarh and back: 180 kms) \n\u2022\
  \tFull of risks and uncertainty (Scooty is not apt for long rides, road conditions\
  \ are unknown, area is full of forests, less inhabited and uncertainty of coming\
  \ back home before dark)\n\u2022\tSpookiness (Read the stories and incidents about\
  \ Bhangarh)\n\nGoogle map found us best possible route to Bhangarh, situated on\
  \ the border of Sariska Tiger Reserve in the Aravali range, Alwar, Rajasthan and\
  \ here I was towards it with my better half. Our first stop was an old fort on a\
  \ small hillock, which reminded of my bicycle trip to Bhangarh with four of my friends\
  \ during college days. As we drove on bumpy roads, I told her about the two famous\
  \ stories associated with Bhangarh:\n\nOne is of Emperor Madho Singh who built the\
  \ city after attaining the approval and on a pre-condition by Guru Balu Nath (an\
  \ ascetic), that shadow of the Emperor\u2019s palace should never fall on his house.\
  \ But after the construction, the palace shadowed the ascetic\u2019s house due to\
  \ which Bhangarh transformed into a cursed city which could never be rebuilt.\n\n\
  Another story pertains to a beautiful Princess Ratnavati, liked by a sorcerer named\
  \ Singhia who decided to entice her with magical oil. But Ratnavati poured the oil\
  \ on the ground which then turned into a boulder and crushed the sorcerer but he\
  \ cursed the city to death before dying. \n\nThe sky became cloudy and we feared\
  \ about the expected rain during return journey. At 0500 pm we reached Fort just\
  \ one hour before the closing time after which entering the place is strictly prohibited\
  \ by Archaeological Survey of India. \n\nA stone at entrance gate read that the\
  \ township was founded in the later half of the 16th Century AD by Emperor Bhagwant\
  \ Das and was made capital of Madho Singh later. The remains consisted of Fort Walls,\
  \ Gateways, Markets, Havelis, Royal Palace, Chattris, Tomb and Temples in \u2018\
  Nagara Style\u2019 of Temple Architecture. In spite of temples in the vicinity,\
  \ People have often felt being followed and slapped by an unknown entity, heard\
  \ noises of screaming and crying and strange music emerging from the fort. \n\n\
  A map encrypted on a stone guided us through the ruins of main market with roofless\
  \ shops which is believed to become lively at night with spirits and ghosts. Locals\
  \ believe that no one dares to build anything with a roof in the vicinity of the\
  \ fort as the roof collapses as soon as it is built. It further guided us to the\
  \ ruins of Royal Palace which had the negativity and foul smell at few places. \n\
  \nAs the darkness started to take over we started our return journey to Jaipur at\
  \ 0615 pm. Clouds with their fat tummies were about to release the rain as if they\
  \ have the same goosebumps for the fear of the unknown but it is sure that there\
  \ is some negativity in the Fort and Ghosts Stories told by locals surely adds to\
  \ that feeling. For a safer journey we took highway route back home and reached\
  \ safely to write this story.\n\nBhangarh on two wheels has always been a real adventure\
  \ from college days. But few questions that are still to be answered; \n\nARE THE\
  \ STORIES TOLD BY LOCALS REAL? \n\nCAN ANYONE DARE TO EXPERIENCE THE UNKNOWN BY\
  \ ENTERING AT NIGHT? ... I don\u2019t know the reality but that warning by a Government\
  \ Organisation surely adds a doubt in our mind.\n\nSo do you still dare to visit\
  \ Bhangarh Fort?"
