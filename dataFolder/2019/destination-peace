Text: "It had started unexpectedly, as it always did, with intricate research of the\
  \ globe\u2019s offerings, only to book the plane tickets 24 hours before departure.\
  \ This time, peace was the destination.\n \nAlthough last minute, this wasn\u2019\
  t merely a rash decision, and instead a timely and wholehearted \u201Cyes\u201D\
  \ to one of a plethora of queries I had sent out to courses abroad over the last\
  \ couple of months. The timing of this yoga course had magically aligned at the\
  \ very last second, and was not merely coincidental, as I know now. After booking\
  \ everything in a panic and silencing my foreshadowing intuition, I hoped I would\
  \ find the inner peace that I was after at the yoga teacher training retreat on\
  \ the Thai island of Ko Samui.\n \nUpon my arrival, I entered the ominous van as\
  \ we whizzed past the places hidden from the brochures. The first voice of warning\
  \ was from a friendly yogi at my arrival, as I waded in the pool overlooking the\
  \ sea. It was a surprise to be on the beachfront \u2013 most things were a surprise.\n\
  \ \nThe location was idyllic, far away from the tourists on the opposite side of\
  \ the island. The evenings had striking sunsets offset with a few locals and their\
  \ buckets, bent over in the low tide, foraging for dinner with the many dogs looking\
  \ on. However, the palm trees did nothing to dissuade the fire that emerged from\
  \ every Ujjayi breath.\n \nI had expected a meditative voice lulling me to inner\
  \ peace in child\u2019s pose and a gentle breeze washing over me and ruffling my\
  \ perfectly coiffed humidity-curled hair. Instead, my compatriot was already crying\
  \ for reasons I had yet to learn, it was a ferocious heat wave and my hair was as\
  \ unruly as the course.\n \nThe motherly cook complained of the oppressive temperatures,\
  \ more than the snake in the kitchen. Lunch was usually very late. Our intensely\
  \ healthy vegan meals, with no sugar, no GMO, no gluten, no nothing, were indeed\
  \ astoundingly delicious but left me wanting. My feces had turned green and I cracked\
  \ jokes about missing chocolate mid-meditation during class, to which the laughter\
  \ drown out the sounds of our hunger pangs. After serving us wholesome meals in\
  \ our colourful spandex, the organizer and cook smoked their cigarettes, digging\
  \ into Thai street food wearing their sweat-stained \u2018Zen retreat\u2019 insignia\
  \ shirts.\n \nWe continued our asanas, our pranayamas, our mudras and the chanting\
  \ - the lizard in my villa chanted nightly too, which made my 5 a.m. wake up calls\
  \ all the more difficult. I couldn\u2019t locate this elusive \u2018peace\u2019\
  \ anywhere. It was a sweaty, achy brand of madness here at the Zen retreat. The\
  \ organizer was vying for the most chaotic person living award; she had punched\
  \ someone at our group dinner, mainly used me as a therapist for her outlandish\
  \ relationship troubles and drunkenly hit a cow with her car on her drive back from\
  \ her regular nightclubbing. The car door was then jammed shut on the left side\
  \ so our \u2018tour\u2019 of the island (an excuse for the organizer to do errands\
  \ while we waited in putrid back alleys, while dancing with the locals) was limited\
  \ to us all piling out of the same door.\n \nThere was laughter, shock and turmoil,\
  \ but no peace. The yogi leader, shipped in straight from India, was fiercer than\
  \ the weather and he found a sick pleasure in making most people cry \u2013 and\
  \ not just because he turned off the fan midway through a grueling class saying\
  \ \"fans kill\" (I always got up and turned it right back on, to the revere of my\
  \ classmates).\n \nOnce back in the sanctuary of my villa, with the air conditioning\
  \ clunking loudly, I laughed at the absurdity of it all. I had signed up for a serene\
  \ oasis and instead had subscribed to the Thai gong show.\n \nAnd it all hit me,\
  \ as I lay sprawled, every kind of exhausted, with the lizard watching me from the\
  \ ceiling and the weeping and yelling next door. Being Zen is laughing, no matter\
  \ what is happening around you.\n \nFinding peace is about embodying peace. It was\
  \ within me all along and I had arrived."
