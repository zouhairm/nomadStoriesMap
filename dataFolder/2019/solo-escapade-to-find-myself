Text: "She, even-though standing at a fair distance, looked a little bit on a lighter\
  \ brownish side, dawning a delicately wrapped white shawl over her body, barely\
  \ reaching her waist; clad in a darker fern shaded long skirt, draped loose enough\
  \ for the wind to enchant it to dance with its flow. She was composed, poised, and\
  \ so mesmerizing that her mere appearance could fix a wrecked soul. \n\nShe, The\
  \ Mother Nature, had this breath-taking view at the foothills of the \u2018Kheerganga\u2019\
  \ Mountains, with River \u2018Parvati\u2019 in the foreground complimenting the\
  \ snow-laced mountains covered with irregularly planted Pine Trees. \n\n\u201CThese\
  \ mountains are captivating, but if we don\u2019t make it to the top before sunset,\
  \ we may freeze to death.\u201D, exclaimed Rahul, almost pulling me out of a trance.\n\
  I\u2019d first met Rahul a day ago, over a match of Table Tennis, a game he\u2019\
  d confessed he sucked at, while we waited for the owner of the hostel to allot us\
  \ the rooms we\u2019d pre-booked. Both of us, non-smokers, were solo travelling\
  \ for the first time, trying to escape the complexities of our monotony struck urban\
  \ lives.\n\nA few failed attempts at getting the game going; and so, we decided\
  \ to abscond the plethora of smokers and potheads that had started gathering around\
  \ in the little open area of the Hostel. Like the prisoners of a jail who\u2019\
  d only recently tasted freedom, those explorers had found their solace in the butt\
  \ of a large joint they\u2019d lit up, hoping to burn away their pains every puff\
  \ and whiff.\n\nMeanwhile, a few hundred metres away, we\u2019d found our comfort\
  \ idling by the stream of river \u2018Parvati\u2019. Our legs dunked in the cold\
  \ water up to our knees, our ears pleased by the chirps of the happiest of birds,\
  \ our lungs taking in the purest of air, our faces sporting the brightest of our\
  \ smiles; and just like that, we ended up planning a two-day extension, hoping to\
  \ explore Kheerganga. \n\nThe morning of the trek started with us absorbing the\
  \ view of the much overwhelming foothills, wherefrom we ascended on to the path\
  \ of much-needed self-glory. A path that took us through minor and steep upslopes\
  \ and downslopes, through streams that\u2019d persevered through cuts and corners,\
  \ and through waterfalls that ushered over the rocks, seemingly in rhythmic harmony.\n\
  \n3 Kilometres, 7 hours and 3 bottles of energy drinks later, we made it atop Kheerganga,\
  \ almost at the time when the sun was retracting its last ray of light, summoning\
  \ the snow-clad mountains to darkness, one mountain at a time. A few hours of exploring\
  \ the little we could before the valley was plunged into darkness, and we resorted\
  \ to our camps with the \u2018arrangements\u2019 several others had bought along;\
  \ Hookah, Liquor and Purest of locally grown Hash. \n\n\u201CGet up!!!\u201D \n\n\
  We\u2019d surrendered to the night and passed on to our dream world, when Rahul\
  \ woke me up in the middle of the night, \u201CLook at the sky!\u201D \nMagical.\
  \ Surreal. It could have been around -4\u2103 then, and the sky was full of stars.\
  \ Stars, that illuminated like someone forgot to switch off the lightbulbs up above.\
  \ My inner solitude that otherwise dwelled in the darkness, rejoiced with each flicker\
  \ of those tiny lightbulbs. Illuminated within, my soul felt like a canvas, my heart\
  \ had painted a smile on.\n\nThe next day, we descended back to the foothills, with\
  \ our stomachs full of all the breakfast we\u2019d had, but our souls ached for\
  \ more. Another morning, to sip on to a cup of \u2018Chai\u2019 watching the sunrise.\
  \ Another evening, to dip in the hot water spring. Another night, to count the stars\
  \ and feel all the wisdom make its way to the heart. But, we continued towards our\
  \ end, sad, but with our hearts at peace.\n\nA kilometre before the trek would conclude,\
  \ I came across a quote \u201CTechnology owes Ecology an Apology\u201D, painted\
  \ thick on an overlooked rock hiding in plain sight. Then, it had been over a day\
  \ since I\u2019d checked my phone; Networks down; Movies unwatched; Landscapes seemed\
  \ soother than John Legend\u2019s \u201CAll of me\u201D, And then, I found something\
  \ I couldn\u2019t discover in the front camera of a phone; Happiness."
