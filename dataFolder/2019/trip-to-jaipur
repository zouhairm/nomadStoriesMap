Text: "I grew up on a heavy dose of Charles Dickens literature, thus one can very\
  \ well relate my fascination for the Royals. So when I got a chance to visit Jaipur,\
  \ I jumped at the opportunity. Once you are in Jaipur you can feel the world of\
  \ Royals, the forts, the palaces, the market \u2013 they all create a sense of nostalgia.\
  \ I don\u2019t want to sound boring but before we start a trip to Jaipur, it is\
  \ worth knowing, how and when this beautiful city was formed.\nJaipur, the largest\
  \ city of Rajasthan was founded by Jai Singh II in 1727. The landscape of Jaipur\
  \ takes your breath away, the city is not only well maintained but very clean. After\
  \ the mad rush of Delhi NCR, Jaipur acted as a soothing balm. The city has a rich\
  \ cultural heritage and an amazing architecture. Every spot in Jaipur has a story\
  \ to narrate and one can see a sense of pride in common people when they describe\
  \ the city past. An ideal Jaipur tour should be of four days, in which 3 days can\
  \ be spent exploring Jaipur and rest one day can be spent visiting Ajmer and Pushkar.\n\
  Hawa Mahal:\nHawa Mahal is made of pink sandstone and is five stories tall. The\
  \ legend behind Hawa Mahal says that the royalty built the Mahal so that the royal\
  \ women folk can see the whole city from the Mahal without being observed by commoners.\
  \ It was truly fun peeping through the Jharokha, with a knowledge that you can watch\
  \ everyone, without being watched.\nCity Palace:\nThe next spot to be covered is\
  \ City palace, very near to Hawa Mahal, almost walking distance. It is right in\
  \ the center of old city. This is the palace where the royalty still lives, so half\
  \ part of the palace is unapproachable. It has got Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal,\
  \ also it contains a museum. I would suggest spending some time over here, and see\
  \ the beauty not only of the architecture but also carvings on the door and walls.\n\
  Amer Fort:\nThis fort is located 11 kms away from Jaipur and was originally build\
  \ by Meena Rulers. The fort is located on top of the hills\n\nHawa Mahal:\nHawa\
  \ Mahal is made of pink sandstone and is five stories tall. The legend behind Hawa\
  \ Mahal says that the royalty built the Mahal so that the royal women folk can see\
  \ the whole city from the Mahal without being observed by commoners. It was truly\
  \ fun peeping through the Jharokha, with a knowledge that you can watch everyone,\
  \ without being watched. Does this sound something out of Sherlock Homes movie??\n\
  \n\nCity Palace:\nThe next spot to be covered is City palace, very near to Hawa\
  \ Mahal, almost walking distance. It is right in the center of old city. This is\
  \ the palace where the royalty still lives, so half part of the palace is unapproachable.\
  \ It has got Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal, also it contains a museum. I would\
  \ suggest spending some time over here, and see the beauty not only of the architecture\
  \ but also carvings on the door and walls.\n\n\nJantar Mantar:\nJantar Mantar is\
  \ definitely an astronomical marvel. It was built by Sawai Jai Singh II, who himself\
  \ took a keen interest in the movement of sun, moon, and planets. It is the best-preserved\
  \ observatory. It contains the equipment\u2019s used by the royalty to study the\
  \ planetary positions.\n\nAmer Fort:\nThis fort is located 11 kms away from Jaipur\
  \ and was originally build by Meena Rulers. The fort is located on top of the hills.\n\
  \nBest Time To Visit Jaipur:\nThe best time to visit Jaipur is from October to March,\
  \ after that it gets very hot.\n\nMarket: In the evening one can visit Bapu Bazar,\
  \ Nehru bazar for shopping.\nFood: Amazing street food is present, do enjoy that.\
  \ The food of Jaipur is yummy but it might be oily and too spicy for some. The food\
  \ is not very expensive over here, one can eat a good meal in Rs 150/-"
