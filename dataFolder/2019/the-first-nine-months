Text: "If it weren\u2019t for her standing in the train station of Venice, Italy,\
  \ I don\u2019t know if I would have the greatest stories of my life. After only\
  \ a twenty-minute conversation with trains whirling all around us and Italians ironically\
  \ telling us to quiet down, I think we fell in love. We reluctantly went our separate\
  \ ways. Her path taking her back to Sweden, where she is from, my path taking me\
  \ to Rome.\n\tIt was both fate and deception from my traveling friend that brought\
  \ her and me back together. After he and I worked in Rome, I boarded a plane to\
  \ Barcelona where he was supposed to meet me the next day. It was when I landed\
  \ that the deception came to fruition. He told me he had booked a ticket to Sweden\
  \ to meet my future partner's friend, Oda, secretly keeping in contact with her\
  \ whilst in Rome. From here the gates of communication had reopened and I took full\
  \ advantage of the opportunity.  A long nine months apart with countless phone calls,\
  \ she and I reunited in the islands of Hawaii. Her name was Hanna, and she is now\
  \ the greatest adventure of my life. \n\tTogether, we worked in the jungles of Hawaii\
  \ chainsawing down the invasive tree species for room and board. We explored the\
  \ island when the chainsaw was back in the shed and had had our usual quinoa and\
  \ cabbage meal that I grew tired of by day three\u2014we were there for two months.\
  \ We hitchhiked all over the island, from the tops of the volcanoes to the giant\
  \ turtle invested sea. We explored green sand beaches, black sand beaches, and white\
  \ sand beaches. We swam with wild dolphins, danced the Polynesian dances, and had\
  \ our fair share of nude encounters with the local hippie population. We defended\
  \ ourselves against wild boar with machetes as they came into our encampment looking\
  \ to eat the fallen fruit, and ran with agony when the fire ants fell on us while\
  \ rubbing up against their habitat. \n\tBoth coming from humble backgrounds, this\
  \ was how we did all our traveling. We worked a horse farm in the desolate countryside\
  \ of Canberra, Australia, where we were responsible for the stables from five in\
  \ the morning until dark. We would see Lupo, their beast of a malamute howling at\
  \ the gang of kangaroos who taunted him as our boots cracked the frost on the way\
  \ to mucking the stables each morning. \n\tWhen we arrived in New Zealand, the first\
  \ three weeks we worked at a family-owned winery in Coromandel. We poured wine,\
  \ picked feijoas (a fruit native to New Zealand, and they are spectacular!), made\
  \ pizzas, and drank a lot\u2014a lot of feijoa liqueur. This is where we also learned\
  \ to surf on the three-hour breaks between shifts from our now good friend, Ford,\
  \ a New Zealand native.  \n\tAfter the three weeks, we bought a van. We named him,\
  \ Charlie, and he will forever be a part of our family.  We lived meagerly for three\
  \ months using all the money we had on refueling Charlie, so we could see every\
  \ inch of both islands\u2014and we did. We were so adamant about saving money on\
  \ food that I had lost over thirty pounds\u2014and I am not a hefty man. Our meal\
  \ plan: Breakfast - A carrot with hummus and an apple; Lunch - A slice of bread\
  \ with flavored tuna; Dinner - canned soup/chili. That was it. When I returned to\
  \ the states, I arrived to a grandmother weeping because she thought I was dying\
  \ of some foreign disease. \n\tNew Zealand, Charlie, and the nine months we started\
  \ our relationship in constant exploration of the world and ourselves are what created\
  \ the greatest foundation for our relationship. Hanna is the greatest discovery\
  \ I have ever made and I most definitely didn't expect that. She has inspired me\
  \ to go farther, seek more, and push for something greater than the norm. My adventure\
  \ is endless due to the love I have for traveling. Each new country is an opportunity\
  \ to meet new and wonderful people who have the capacity to show me something new.\
  \ And that's all I need\u2014to learn something new."
