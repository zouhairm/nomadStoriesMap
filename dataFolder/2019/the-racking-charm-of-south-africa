Text: "The twenty-seven hour trip towards our goal was coloured in a pink haze. Usually,\
  \ when the rose coloured glasses fall, the unpleasant truth stains the \"picture\
  \ perfect\". This time the non-tourist experience of the breathtaking ugliness created\
  \ the image. \u201CBeauty\u201D as the one missing puzzle piece, yet it completed\
  \ the picture and lowered our heads from the clouds of an impeccable 21st century.\
  \ Followed by the 2-minute showers we were supposed to have. The burden of wasted\
  \ drops lay on our own shoulders. Maybe this is what created our first African feeling\
  \ - being woken up by exotic birds, which sounded like stray kids screeching. Weirdly,\
  \ it smelt like the rain. Might have been the spell of the ocean \u2013 to mask\
  \ the stench of drought. As the birds sang their song welcoming the sun, we woke\
  \ up, leaving behind the privilege of water.\n\nEarly mornings with organisations\
  \ that helped people \u2013 disabled, lost or poor. We sat around tables, drank\
  \ the precious water and tried to fight the reminisce of lack of sleep. It was not\
  \ boring. It was the factual accuracy, the wave of it. It was hitting us like a\
  \ truck after every word that rolled down their desert lips. Knocking us out completely.\
  \ And what we saw in their eyes was both a curse and a blessing. Our wish to help,\
  \ but the inability to perform. Our compassion, but lack of exposure to comprehend.\
  \ We were listening to people who fought against diseases, whilst being surrounded\
  \ by palm trees. The perfect mix of the sun and the ocean \u2013 a five-star holiday.\
  \ We saw underneath the gold surface, the backstage of people playing the foolproof\
  \ roles. \n\nWe did not visit Robben Island and somehow it was unnecessary. It has\
  \ been said that the only hope there was the visible Table Top from a detainee's\
  \ cells. We were between the people who needed just as much hope against famine\
  \ and dust. We felt the power of Table Top right there \u2013 the pillar of faith.\
  \ It was constant. Hidden by the \"tablecloth\" or not, it was the backbone of the\
  \ place. And the people here were the trees growing towards the Table Top, striving\
  \ in between the bushes. Towards the top. The experience was scorched behind our\
  \ lids - the outline of racking charm. Yet it was not only the pain of the people\
  \ we met, or the degree they were in. It was the knowledge. Cape of inspiration.\
  \ Like the sweet smell of flowers for bees \u2013 we were drawn towards the beautiful\
  \ humans here. They never viewed us differently, standing out as the sore thumb\
  \ only in our own eyes. We were acknowledged and then pleasantly ignored further,\
  \ mixing."
