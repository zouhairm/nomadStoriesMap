Text: "This was my first time to Bangladesh,Sourab was my friend there. He had a tanned\
  \ face and clear eyes. We were started on a journey from Dhaka.He was a good guide.\
  \ He was born there and knows it like the palm of his hand.\n\tWe were on Dhaka\
  \ street. The streets were crowded with people and Rickshaws.They drove very fast.\
  \  there was a bridge on their street. There were a lot of people on the bridge.\
  \ There were sporadic things under the bridge.The signal on their side was not very\
  \ good. I called my boyfriend and chatted with him. I heard nothing but he only\
  \ said no.Without a fellow countryman around me, I felt sad and afraid. It was hard\
  \ for us to do anything on street. Shocking about what I had seen.The girls here\
  \ all wear headscarves and go out wrapped tightly.Ahead of me, a Rickshaw man he\
  \ was very thin and struggled to ride his with beans of sweat on his face.He was\
  \ shining in the sunshine.His face seemed to have a tear in the light, but his smile\
  \ was faint.I was followed Sourab, silence last for a long time.\n       Sourab\
  \ brought me to his home. We sat on the train and there were small traders selling\
  \ jackfruit along the way. It is a kind of big jackfruit I have never seen before.\
  \ I haven't eaten it, but it was very big. It may be very delicious, he bought some\
  \ biscuits for me to eat, I did not eat, he said it was dangerous to me and asked\
  \ me to pay attention to safety, I hummed and did not say anything, then I went\
  \ to his home, his family has a large land, their house rented to others to do business,\
  \ it seemed that he was the landlord's son, his father was a teacher, when I went,\
  \ his house was being renovated, his family was a single house. The small house\
  \ had two floors and looks very rich.His family also had several black sheep and\
  \ puppies, but they were thin and nutritious, but this kind of sheep was the first\
  \ time I saw and felt that they really grew different from domestic sheep.There\
  \ were some strange birds flying around on the second floor of his house. The black\
  \ calls were also very loud. After that, we had lunch at his home. His food was\
  \ really delicious. He asked me to eat more, but I refused. It was impolite to eat\
  \ other people's food alone.\n       We took the train to Chattogram, where the\
  \ train was crowded on the roof. It looked very popular. It was like a Hollywood\
  \ blockbuster. I had never seen it before.The scenery along the train was very beautiful.\
  \ Passing their house along the way, I had never seen a bright color before. I felt\
  \ very strange.When we went there, it rained heavily, so I didn't visit many places,\
  \ only went to the zoo. Maybe because of the heavy rain, the animals hid away and\
  \ we didn't see anything. But it was raining cats and dogs. My mood was as wet as\
  \ rain on the rainy ground. I wanted to do something, but I couldn't do anything.\
  \ I was sad for no reason.\n       As City of Mosques, We met a lot of Muslims on\
  \ this day. They knelt neatly in the street, murmured something, and sometimes worshipped.\
  \ I nodded slightly to them.And said \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0647\u0627\u062F\u0629."
