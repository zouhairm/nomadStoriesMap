Text: "Shubh yatra! That's what i was wished for my travel alone story to all the\
  \ way to Shanghai, China. Yes!! My first solo travel was to international destination\
  \ for official work. I wasn't prepared for this. But where you are there you are.\
  \ my first solo my first messed up and my last scared trip of life. Yeah things\
  \ pretty screwed up right from missing flights,to forgetting my wallet somewhere,\
  \ to alot others. But all was worth it for letting me understand my love for solo\
  \ travel. I loved the way they were frinedly and understanding and yes very cute\
  \ also.\nI am not some foodie freak but i did love all the Chinese authentic food.\
  \ Though it was my official trip but i did put up ky guts for going out alone to\
  \ roam. My outing was to a budhha temple. Here in india we don't pay for going to\
  \ temple but in Shanghai, we need to pay to enter any temple and I guess the older\
  \ the temple, the higher would be the cost. Right from the deep soothing sound to\
  \ the chanting of the prayers by monks, all let u go in some trans world. Maybe\
  \ a way to find your inner self. Few selfies few clicks for Facebook and dp. I was\
  \ done. I thought of walking out to my hotel which seemed pretty straight road but\
  \ damm it was hell of long walking distance of 45 mins. I happened to catch a beautiful\
  \ garden with people doing silent Chinese slow motion dance. It was cool though!!\
  \ After that next day was my official training and then we were taken to the E square\
  \  place where alot of people hangout at evening beside the lake that divide the\
  \ shangai and Beijing. The cold wind, crowded people and a beautiful song played\
  \ on guitar by some artist in middle of the crowd and road.. i loveeeedd it \u2764\
  \uFE0F. (U need guts to do that)  the next three days went away with alot of hectic\
  \ training but never mind the tea and snacks saved it all :P. The last day i was\
  \ parted by a gift from my colleague and i loved the stole what they had given me.\
  \ I still have it. I did some Street shopping. (China is famous for that as u know).\
  \ We went to another Buddha temple, this time it was way older than the previous\
  \ and i loved the huge statue of the lord Buddha. I didn't have anyone to tell me\
  \ story or why the statue had been craved it in a particular way. Whatever it may\
  \ be. It was astonishingly awesome! I packed my bag and left with heavy heart the\
  \ hotel where i have been staying for last 7days. It was kinda of second loved cozy\
  \ home now!! I still miss the bed !! When i was heading back something evoke within\
  \ me, \"A Traveller\". It was something that was scary yet adventurous. I loved\
  \ adventure before also but Never really liked the idea of solo traveling. This\
  \ is what travelling solo makes u understand and realize. It brings out the hidden\
  \ loveable of ur life. Be it solo traveling or with people the main reason for the\
  \ people traveling is to find onself to be with one self. I am not saying i am well\
  \ planned well handled travel with excellent experience NO! Nah!! Nahi!!  I had\
  \ my share of ups and down i have it even now. But that's okay that's okay because\
  \ u are human. U have a liberty to do mistake!! :P. Travel to explore the different\
  \ cultures people stay. To know their beliefs so that u can understand your beliefs\
  \ even better. Yeah there are some precautions u need to take, but after some point\
  \ its about letting yourself go! A typical cliche dialogue of just go with flow\
  \ !!! Well that's it is!! There are many stories poems and writings that inspire\
  \ u to travel. Try to find yours. Choose your style your motivation. There isn't\
  \ a right time but whenever it is time will take u (a bit effort from you too) and\
  \ all i say is \"HAPPY TRAVELING PALS ENJOY YOUR RIDE LOVE ALWAYS\""
