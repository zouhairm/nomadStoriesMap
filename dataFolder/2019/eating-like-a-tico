Text: "\u201CCome.  Come,\u201D he commands in Spanish.  Eat. Eat.  I stare at the\
  \ hunk of white, muscly flesh embedded with bits of sand.  It rests on a blood-slicked\
  \ knife held by a gritty hand.  Reluctantly, lacking enough Spanish words to refuse\
  \ a second proposition, I reach for the shellfish.\n\nI had arrived in Costa Rica\
  \ three hours earlier and settled in at Playas del Coco thirty minutes ago.  A quick\
  \ change into beach attire and it was time to shake off the travel day and explore\
  \ the area.\n\nThe beach is dark brown, almost muddy, and the water is not translucent.\
  \  Parked out of the tide's grasp are the kayaks and SUPs used to reach the fishing\
  \ boats anchored thirty yards offshore.    \n\nThe tourist trade of Coco Bay has\
  \ not yet stamped out the local scene.  Neighborhood hotels and restaurants line\
  \ the bay.  Young teens practice at the skateboarding ramp as sightseers stroll\
  \ by on a groomed pathway.  Collarless, ratty-furred dogs bump from person to person\
  \ hoping for a handout.\n\nLate in the day, the beach occupants are predominantly\
  \ locals or ticos.  A nearby bar, using American 80's pop songs as bait, has sucked\
  \ in most of the tourists.  Tucked up in the meager shade between the pathway and\
  \ the beach, families are creating dinner with food pulled from plastic bags and\
  \ a cooler.  Standing chest-deep in the water, men handline fish with homemade circular\
  \ reels with no rods.  There is chatter between the fishermen.  The tone of the\
  \ words thrown about and the smiles on their faces as they swap positions and recast\
  \ indicates good-natured ribbing.\n\nOnshore, a stocky bare-chested barrel of a\
  \ man whacks a shell against a rock.  A pile of empty shells - black, bumpy exterior\
  \ with a pearly slick white interior - lays beside him.  Intermixed with the shells\
  \ are blood and a bone.  Shells, blood and a bone?  Curious, I creep closer.  He\
  \ smiles and motions me forward.\n\nI attempt a conversation with broken Spanish\
  \ and charades.  What is this? What are you doing? He mimes eating and offers me\
  \ a hunk of meat.  My brain screams an all-out warning.  I don\u2019t know this\
  \ man.  This isn\u2019t a sanitary environment.  All travel warnings say avoid uncooked\
  \ food.  Getting sick on day one of my travels is not on the agenda.  \u201CNo.\
  \  Gracias.\u201D  I shake my head and wave him off.\n\nHe frowns - frustrated.\
  \  His hand gesture tells me to wait.  Running to the water, he returns with a fresh\
  \ shell.  After slamming it against the rock, he uses the knife to pry open the\
  \ shell.  Cutting the meat loose, he splits it into two pieces.  One-half he takes\
  \ to mimic eating.  The other half he offers to me on the bloody knife.  \u201C\
  Come.  Come.\u201D\n\nThere is no way out.  I pop the meat into my mouth, wondering\
  \ if it is possible to swallow it whole without choking.  But a salty, sweet flavor\
  \ encourages me to bite into the tender morsel.  Surprised, I find myself savoring\
  \ it, wanting more.  Watching my face, he devours his chunk.  Nodding his head,\
  \ he mumbles  \u201Cmmmm. \xBFS\xED?\u201D\n\nGrinning, I wonder if \u201Cyum\u201D\
  \ requires translation.  \u201CMuy bueno.  \xA1Gracias!\u201D I exclaim fluttering\
  \ my hand over my heart.  He nods, satisfied, and bows slightly as I walk away.\n\
  \nThe tone of my travels has been set.  Embrace the unknown.  Seek out local.  Throw\
  \ standard travel advice to the wind and enjoy living like a tico."
