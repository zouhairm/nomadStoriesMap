  \nYamal. What do foreigners know about this place? Probably nothing. Only people\
  \ associated with the energy sector, the oil and gas industry imagine where this\
  \ part of Russia is located.\nThe flight from Moscow takes 4 hours. You fly over\
  \ the Urals, industrial cities of Russia - they glow with small dots from under\
  \ the clouds.\n-36 degrees Celsius instead of the expected -45. Calm giant snowy\
  \ spaces and the energy of the sun that is not hidden by the clouds. Power lines\
  \ - the only evidence of the presence of civilization here.\n\nThe purpose of my\
  \ trip - the company \"Yamal LNG\", located in the city Sabetta. The peninsula has\
  \ enormous volumes of natural gas, so gas companies compete here for a place under\
  \ the Yamal sun.\n According to the engineer Yamal LNG, there is no local population\
  \ here. I mean people whose ancestors lived here from time immemorial. Rather, there\
  \ is a village of 5 people. But who they are, where they are is a little clear.\
  \ Their forefathers were nomads. In part, this way of life has been preserved by\
  \ modern indigenous people. So, in the region there is a constant increase in population,\
  \ but it happens only due to the development of gas production enterprises. Workers\
  \ come here on watch - 28 days, then leave for a month to go home. Few want to transport\
  \ their family here. \n\nThere is practically no vegetation here - only in the summer,\
  \ perhaps, small patches of soil, covered with moss, open up. There are dodging\
  \ paths on the snow \u2014 they are scribes; they resort to workers to feed themselves.\
  \ You will rarely see bears here - they are alien to incomprehensible and strange\
  \ people. The team of gas carrier \"Fedor Litke\" managed to photograph the animals,\
  \ but this is an incredible success, because making out polar bears on white snow\
  \ surrounded by white fog is a task worthy of an experienced sniper.\n\nRecently\
  \ there have been three suns observed - two reflections of the present in ice crystals.\
  \ If people had not studied the nature of this optical phenomenon, they would probably\
  \ have believed in the power of the Nenets shamans. The air is so dense and white\
  \ that, willy-nilly, peering into space, you see someone's faces, figures, whole\
  \ stories. It is worth spending some time here for those who write fairy tales,\
  \ because Yamal gives new directions to the imagination.\nAnd throughout my stay\
  \ in Yamal, the fear of loneliness did not leave me. It seems that getting lost\
  \ in a foreign city in a foreign country without knowing the language compared to\
  \ getting lost in the huge tundra is a little fun adventure. Alone here a man is\
  \ not a survivor. Finding yourself in absolute solitude here, you will die the most\
  \ humane death - a dream. And then you will know all the tales that Yamal drew for\
  \ you."
