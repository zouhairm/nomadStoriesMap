Text: "Cruising along the dusty red track in our small Nissan 4X4 we came to stop\
  \ when Fran, our driver who I met in a Darwin hostel a few days earlier, noticed\
  \ a deep puddle in the road to Jim Jim Falls. It was early May 2016 when we decided\
  \ to tackle the roads of Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory of Australia,\
  \ so the park was a mixture of dried dirt roads and flooded green wetland where\
  \ the water sat stagnating. Mark, our third and final passenger who we met at the\
  \ same hostel bar in Darwin, started egging Fran on. He wanted her to drive through\
  \ the small pond, although it was clearly only for larger off road vehicles. Instead,\
  \ me and Fran thought it would be better to drive around the water, through the\
  \ mud and trees.\n\nProblem solved. Fran started the car and proceeded to drive\
  \ around the puddle. The Nissan stopped moving. The quiet nature around us interrupted\
  \ by deep mumbling from the tires. Wet mud was flung all over the windows. We had\
  \ become stuck in the mud and would have to wait for help. \n\nIn the distance,\
  \ we saw an old ute (Australian for pickup truck) churning up dust on its way toward\
  \ our car. The vehicle was a white or grey but covered by brown dirt and bright\
  \ red sand; the cargo tray a rusty orange, indistinguishable from the Australian\
  \ dust. The man inside looked late 70s, but with the tanned leathery skin from decades\
  \ in the sun he could have been much younger. He gave us a sigh and some classic\
  \ Aussie wit about us youngsters being stuck in the middle of nowhere, but quickly\
  \ offered to help us with his tow rope.\n\nHis powerful machine dragged ours backwards\
  \ out the ground, so he took back his tow rope and got back into his cabin. He was\
  \ a man of few words, but did part with some helpful advice:\n\n\u201CDon\u2019\
  t try going any further in that thing, leave it and hop on.\u201D\n\nWe did not\
  \ need to be asked twice and all three of us jumped on the truck for a ride to Jim\
  \ Jim Falls. Once aboard, he gave us a: \u201CNo worries, name\u2019s Tim\u201D\
  \ and drove on.\n\nNone of the three of us had ever rode in the back of an open\
  \ truck before and did not expect Tim to drive quite so quickly with three live\
  \ passengers. Nothing was stopping us from sliding off the back, and the unpaved\
  \ roads of Kakadu were not exactly smooth. My body was not in contact with the vehicle\
  \ at all times. It was like a rollercoaster, except without the safety harnesses.\
  \ Thankfully, we all reached Jim Jim in one piece.\n\nAfter an upriver walk over\
  \ boulders and through trees, the four of us made it to the clearing and saw the\
  \ two magnificent waterfalls, plunging into a pool.\n\n\u201CGood eh, enjoy yourselves.\u201D\
  \n\nWe turned to Tim, who had already stripped to his underwear before bumbling\
  \ away into the water to swim. \n\nI tried to take some pictures of the falls before\
  \ hit the water but failed to get any good ones. At 200 metres in height and with\
  \ the clearing relatively close to the falls, I found it impossible to get the top\
  \ of the falls and the plunge pool in one photo. Disappointed, I took it in with\
  \ my eyes and captured the scene with my memory before enjoying a dip with Fran,\
  \ Mark and our new friend Tim.\n\nWhen Tim was ready, we all traversed back to the\
  \ ute for a ride back to our car somewhere in the Kakadu forest. The ride back was\
  \ a lot smoother, whether Tim was calmer after the gentle swim or if he just liked\
  \ us more, we will never know. Back at where we left our car, Tim stopped to let\
  \ us out.\n\n\u201CNow you guys don\u2019t go getting stuck again, I won\u2019t\
  \ be around all the time.\u201D\n\nWith that he drove off, leaving us covered in\
  \ the red Australian dust. On the way back to our campsite, we drove with silent\
  \ smiles. We were thankful for Jim. Our silent saviour."
