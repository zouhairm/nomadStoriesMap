Text: "I had arrived in one of the small towns outside of Cinque Terre, referred to\
  \ my some travel guides as the sixth town. I was studying abroad for a year. And\
  \ it was my birthday. Rather than spending a dreary day in Edinburgh, I had decided\
  \ to travel to one of my favorite countries and go on the famous hikes of Cinque\
  \ Terre. A poor student I decided to stay in the town a little off the beaten path\
  \ to save money. Little did I realize that weekend in April was a national holiday.\
  \ And the local families had decided that was the best place to stay too. In this\
  \ local tourist town, I had never felt more alone. \nArriving in the afternoon,\
  \ I checked into the only hostel in town. And as it was the shoulder season I was\
  \ one of only a handful of residents. A generally outgoing person I cruised the\
  \ public areas, yet alas, I was the youngest by many years, and the majority seemed\
  \ to be European tourists, few of whom spoke English. \nNot to be dissuaded, I packed\
  \ my day bag and off I went to tour the town. With its two streets that took all\
  \ of 30 minutes. It had stunning views though, and an ancient castle, which I lost\
  \ myself in for a few hours. And then it was dinner. Alone and in a town filled\
  \ with families I was not up to testing my little Italian asking for a table for\
  \ one at a local restaurant. As even off the beaten path, this town catered to local\
  \ tourists and included the tourist mark up -- not in my starving student budget.\
  \ \nSo I decided to make the best of it. I went to the supermarket and grabbed some\
  \ wine and crackers. I then went to one of the few places that did take out and\
  \ ordered a cone of deep-fried seafood. And I went off to find somewhere to enjoy\
  \ it. \nAs the light faded, and the families made for early nights or became ensconced\
  \ in restaurants, I decided if I wasn't having the riotous time I thought I would\
  \ I could still make it a night to remember. So I hopped a low crumbling outer wall\
  \ of the castle, out of sight from the main street. And I sat on a boulder, overlooking\
  \ the sea as the sunset. I ate my fish and turned to the bottle of wine. And came\
  \ up with my final barrier of the night: a cork. \nWithout a corkscrew, I pitied\
  \ myself for a moment. On my birthday. Alone in a foreign country. \nThen I remembered\
  \ if I could get into a university half-way around the world I could open a bottle\
  \ of wine. And so I tried to use my room key - to no avail. I tried to use my shoe\
  \ (a trick I have never seen work). And finally I realized my chapstick fit inside\
  \ the neck of the bottle, and if it wouldn't come out it would have to go it. Not\
  \ getting the leverage I needed on the boulder, I walked up to the castle wall and\
  \ pounded the cork into the bottle. Where a good dash of red wine splattered on\
  \ the wall. And that is how I made my mark in Italy. \nTriumphant I sat back on\
  \ the boulder, listening to the waves crash on the coast, thinking about how lucky\
  \ I was to be there, and what the tourists would think looking at that wall in the\
  \ morning."
