Text: "Hello, my name is Benjamin Yates.  I\u2019m 25 years old and I recently graduated\
  \ from Harvard University with a major in writing and minor in journalism.  People\
  \ know me for my outspokenness and positivity.  I always want to help someone if\
  \ I can.  This past year, I made a New Years resolution to travel to at least one\
  \ place that I\u2019ve always wanted to go, but never had the chance.  With school,\
  \ work, and errands that us adults get the pleasure of doing I never got around\
  \ to it.  That all changed about a month after I graduated.  The celebrations that\
  \ went along with being awarded for graduating ensued over the course of the following\
  \ weekend.  Things went along normally at Starbucks on campus, where I continued\
  \ to work up until a week before I left for the city that\u2019s home to the Eiffel\
  \ Tower.  The language spoken by the people there is known as the \u2018language\
  \ of love\u2019.  Yes, your assumption hasn\u2019t deceived you.  For quite some\
  \ time now, I\u2019ve wanted to travel to Paris, France and see the many wonders\
  \ that it beholds.  I\u2019ve always dreamed of climbing the Eiffel Tower, visiting\
  \ the Cath\xE9drale Notre Dame de Paris, and marveling at the many treasures of\
  \ the iconic Louvre Museum.  Yet, I would soon be surprised to find out that there\
  \ is no fathomable comparison to what or who I\u2019d encounter.  A couple of days\
  \ before I had to quit, I realized that I was at a time and place in my life where\
  \ I could make my dream a reality.  The only ones that knew besides myself were\
  \ my friends and a few coworkers.  They were all happy and excited for me when I\
  \ told them of my upcoming adventure and wished to go along.  Unfortunately, their\
  \ lives had other demands.  We parted ways and made plans to get together whenever\
  \ I returned.  When I did, I brought a special someone along with me.  I rented\
  \ a cab at about 4:30 p.m. on Friday afternoon and rode to the airport.  The routine\
  \ series of events unfolded while I was there.  However, time was moving at an unprecedented\
  \ pace.  Shortly thereafter, I boarded my flight and began my trek to France.  Like\
  \ any young woman or man will do, I tapped the music icon on my phone and scrolled\
  \ to my favorite playlist.  For the first three and a half hours, I sat in my window\
  \ seat listening to Bach and Beethoven while pondering what just might happen during\
  \ my stay.  The remainder of my flight consisted of getting some good ole\u2019\
  \ fashioned shut-eye.  All of the sudden, I heard the pilot come on the intercom.\
  \  He informed\nall passengers that it was time to exit.  I arrived at Bordeaux\
  \ Airport at approximately midnight.  My luggage wasn\u2019t hard to find on the\
  \ luggage rack and I grabbed it without a moment\u2019s delay.  I descended the\
  \ exit ramp with my luggage in tow and headed for the entrance terminal.  When I\
  \ got there, security went rather quickly.  At least, that\u2019s how I saw it.\
  \  I gathered my belongings when I completed the last checkpoint and made my way\
  \ around the airport.  The variety of places to go was quite remarkable.  If I had\
  \ enough space in my luggage and backpack, I would\u2019ve gotten a brochure from\
  \ every stand there was.  Anyways, I got a few of the most intriguing ones and decided\
  \ to get a cup of coffee from Starbucks.  I walked in and got in line with only\
  \ a few people in front of me.  I ordered a venti black dark roast and let the barista\
  \ scan my phone.  She then walked over to the machine that held that particular\
  \ brew and poured it into a venti-sized cup that was in a stack close-by.  She got\
  \ a lid from the stack beside of it and put it on the cup.  I decided not to get\
  \ a sticker this time and made my way to one of the many seats.  It was about 2:00\
  \ a.m. at this point, when time suddenly began to pass at an even faster rate. \
  \ She was sitting in a seat by herself.  That\u2019s when it..."
