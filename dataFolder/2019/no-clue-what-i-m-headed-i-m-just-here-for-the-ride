Text: "I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be coming to Ireland until very last minute, Friday\
  \ I found out, Monday we flew. I hadn\u2019t known what exactly to expect. I knew\
  \ we were coming for a three-month internship, we had been given host families to\
  \ live with and that due to the insurance policy we wouldn\u2019t be allowed back\
  \ to the UK without purchasing a new one. \n\nI'd experienced a lot of hardship,\
  \ heartbreak and hurt in London. It never felt like where I belonged, I studied\
  \ for three years in Leicester, the 5 months after I graduated were spent traveling,\
  \ then this popped up and it felt like fate, a breath of fresh air that had been\
  \ meant for me. So, I took the plunge, I had nothing to lose.\n\nThat weekend before\
  \ was spent in tears, my ex had stolen my passport and I was at the lowest point\
  \ in my life, I needed this break but someone (it felt like) had stolen said opportunity\
  \ from me. Luckily enough, you\u2019re able to travel with a driving license to\
  \ Ireland if you\u2019re British and vice versa. So, I booked a new flight with\
  \ a different airline and I made my way to the airport. I don\u2019t think I've\
  \ ever felt such a 'whoosh' come over me.\n\nEach step was taking me one step closer\
  \ to Dublin and I couldn\u2019t believe it. I slept on the flight, and we got there\
  \ in about 40 minutes. The company I was doing my internship with had arranged a\
  \ car to collect me and take me to my host family\u2019s home, which would be mine\
  \ for the next three months. I arrived and an old man around 70 opened the door.\
  \ At first, I thought they had made a mistake, the group I had been traveling with\
  \ (who got the earlier flight because at that point I was still without a passport)\
  \ had been describing their host families in the group chat; they were young couples,\
  \ kids running around. Mine where an elderly couple. After an awkward exchange I\
  \ put my things away and we got to know each other, they asked about the headache\
  \ I had getting there and Paul, my host dad offered to drop me to the meeting I\
  \ had the following day. As a man of his word he did, he accompanied me on my journey\
  \ to show me how to get to and from. \n\nAfter settling in Dublin was many a trip\
  \ of social nights out with the friends I had made and the friends that had come\
  \ to visit me. I think it came at the perfect time for me, so far I\u2019ve toured\
  \ around and seen Galway, Tullamore, and Ennis. Done all the typical touristy things\
  \ like the temple bar and the Guinness factory. I love it here and I  seriously\
  \ considered staying on. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely expensive to live here, similar\
  \ if not pricier than London. However, that could be down to me only really shopping\
  \ in the more expensive stores like Superdrug\u2019s and Boots whereas back home\
  \ I knew all the little hidden stores that sold things at half price. It wasn\u2019\
  t a hard transition for me either. I\u2019ve always pretty much been on the move\
  \ for as long as I could remember, in between different family homes, from 18 I\
  \ went to study in Leicester for three years and then the five months after I graduated\
  \ was spent touring the world as best I could within my pay grade. Plus, I had visited\
  \ Dublin twice before once for my birthday and another time with my mum to watch\
  \ Lauren hill in concert. For me, I\u2019m still searching for places that feel\
  \ like home, as much as I love Dublin this still feels like a place I\u2019m visiting\
  \ as opposed to home. Hence why the journey continues and that isn\u2019t a bad\
  \ thing at all. I wonder where the journey will take me next?"
