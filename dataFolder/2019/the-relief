Text: "It was that tired, wobbly feeling you get from either eating or drinking too\
  \ much... Well, that or the fact I was on an old, slow Chinese train that rocked\
  \ back and forth with furry before jerking to a stop at every station. Then again,\
  \ it was probably all of those.\n\nI had just finished being treated to a lavish\
  \ banquet of North-eastern delicacies, beer, and, of course, baijiu, China's potent\
  \ spirit. My hosts had insisted that I attend, and seeing as this was my first banquet,\
  \ I had purchased a whole new set of clothes including trousers, shirt, and belt.\n\
  \nBeing a little tipsy and needing to get to my next destination, I hopped on the\
  \ train from the city of Changchun and was now heading to Siping, a small yet strategic\
  \ Chinese city of 400,000 people located in the plains of the Northeast. The people\
  \ here are tough yet inviting. Many are farmers who toil most of the year through\
  \ frigid temperatures and many extremes.  \n\nEven in the adversity of revolutions,\
  \ development of a nation, and weather, they are some of the most resilient people\
  \ around. You have to be when temperatures plunge to -40\xB0 C in the winter. Plus,\
  \ these challenges make it hard to turn down an invite for another drink.\n\nIt\
  \ was having a few too many of those drinks that led to the urge to use the facilities.\
  \ That\u2019s where I headed. I staggered my way through the train\u2019s narrow\
  \ aisle to the small and acrid lavatory, all while stepping over sleeping bodies\
  \ and dodging piles of rubbish thrown on the floor. Upon entering, I became aware\
  \ of another adversity\u2026 my new belt. \n\nIt seemed simple enough. It was a\
  \ basic ratcheting system, where one must push a little to pull open.\n\nUnfortunately,\
  \ it was much more like a Chinese finger trap! No matter what I did, I couldn't\
  \ get it open! I pushed, pulled, yanked, tightened, and manhandled\u2026 The urge\
  \ was unbearable. \n\nThinking quickly, I opened the door and found a man starting\
  \ up a cigarette. In my slurred Mandarin and exaggerated sign language, I beckoned\
  \ for the aid of this stranger. \n\nWithout a second of hesitation, he squatted\
  \ down to hip height and started doing the same\u2026 pushing, pulling, yanking,\
  \ tightening, and manhandling my belt. All the while, I stood with my face flushed,\
  \ fidgeting and singing 'Spoonful of Sugar' just to keep my mind occupied from the\
  \ pressure building in my bladder.\n\nJust then, his mate popped out of the other\
  \ lavatory. He took a look. Raised an eyebrow. Then dropped down to help out, too.\
  \ \n\nThere I was with two Chinese farmers on their knees, cigarettes still alight,\
  \ trying to open my ratcheting belt with their backs to the rest of the car.\n\n\
  That's when I noticed\u2026 the only sound was the movement of the train.  There\
  \ were no people shouting, no music was playing, nothing\u2026 So, I looked up.\
  \ \nThe whole car was watching this event unfold. All eyes were glued on these two\
  \ men as they intently worked on this foreigner\u2019s waste line\u2026 well, from\
  \ their view it probably looked like a different picture and I\u2019m sure someone\
  \ grabbed their phone for a video. Regardless, they could definitely see the sweat\
  \ and discomfort pouring from my face.\n\nFinally, it slipped\u2026 my saviours\
  \ had worked their magic and the belt opened. With a whirl and a shout of thanks,\
  \ I was back in the loo to finish what I started. Ah... the relief. \n\nExpecting\
  \ applause or at least some jovial harassment upon my exit, I was surprised to be\
  \ received with nothing. The men were gone, and everything was right back to the\
  \ way it was. People playing cards, music blaring, and conversations were back in\
  \ full swing.\n\nSuch is the way in the Northeast. Even with strange and difficult\
  \ events, things always go back to normal. Resilience and endurance are keys to\
  \ survival and balance out the Ying and Yang of life in this region. This warm and\
  \ hospitable culture was the reason that two strangers eagerly helped out an outsider\
  \ who couldn\u2019t even realise that he had a perfectly functioning zip."
