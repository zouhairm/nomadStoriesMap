Text: "Whether completing a literature review, gaining access to communities of interest,\
  \ or analyzing data, research abroad is a journey filled with twists and turns.\
  \ You may have an amazing thesis initially, then realize that reality is not the\
  \ same as it is presented in literature upon reaching the field. You may also realize\
  \ the issue you thought was affecting your target group is different from what you\
  \ assumed. A change of plans can be frustrating, especially after arduous preparation\
  \ prior to entering the field, but this does not mean your project is over. In fact,\
  \ this is a worthwhile experience. Before embarking on my two-month Cuban journey\
  \ I had ideas of what I would find, and I immediately had to change my project within\
  \ the first week. It is important to remain flexible, and open to change, as it\
  \ is all a part of the journey.\n\nAs an undergraduate studying anthropology at\
  \ UCLA, my research examined Abakua, an all-male secret society in Cuba. Established\
  \ in 1836 by slaves, Abakua secretly operated as a mutual aid network that provided\
  \ protection. After the abolition of slavery (1886), members gained key positions\
  \ within blue collar professions and developed a network guaranteeing Abakua initiates\
  \ employment consistent employment. Although power largely dwindled after the 1959\
  \ Cuban revolution, Abakua temples can be found throughout Havana and Matanzas barrios,\
  \ Abakua is celebrated as an authentic legacy of the Afro-Cuban experience especially\
  \ as it is forbidden from being exported or initiating non-Cubans.\n\nWith President\
  \ Obama\u2019s plan of reinstating relations between America and Cuba, I questioned\
  \ whether Abakua would regain control over the docks and slaughterhouses of Havana,\
  \ and if they would initiate more foreigners as this would arguably increase economic\
  \ reach. However, shortly after I arrived in Havana in June 2017, President Trump\
  \ announced plans to restrict American travel to the island. Nonetheless, American\
  \ tourist dollars coming into Cuba were not reaching the masses of people in marginalized\
  \ areas where Abakua temples were present. I also realized how difficult it is for\
  \ various religions and organizations to have power within a socialist society.\
  \ \n\nI planned to do archival work in the Biblioteca Nacional and ethnographies\
  \ of Abakua ceremonies. I was fortunate to have interviews with Abakua members and\
  \ Cuban scholars my first week in the field, which helped point to a new direction\
  \ for my research. I was notified that the legacy of Abakua is rebellion against\
  \ power structures, not power granted through control. Members emphasized that manliness,\
  \ or hombria is the true force behind the bravery that earned Abakua its reputation.\
  \ From initial interviews, I gathered that many youths who happen to be Abakua members\
  \ have gained a bad reputation for problematic hypermasculine behavior, which many\
  \ have come to associate with Abakua. This behavior, known as guaperia, was referenced\
  \ so frequently that I decided to further examine this situation. As my new research\
  \ project, I decided to interview members on their life-stories, asking what brought\
  \ them to Abakua, and their opinions on the hombria-guaperia dichotomy. \n\nI then\
  \ faced the problem of access! I needed consistent access to Abakua members in order\
  \ to gain entry into ceremonies and hold more interviews with members. As Abakua\
  \ is a secret society, many people were apprehensive about discussing the topic\
  \ with me. I needed to make sure that I was not offensive and assured interviewees\
  \ at all times that I was interested in cosas sociales, not ritual secrets. After\
  \ I was introduced to a writer and journalist who happened to be an Abakua member,\
  \ I found myself having more interviews and even being invited to important Abakua\
  \ events. \nStories of exclusivity and power ignited much of my initial interest\
  \ in Abakua. However, during my time in Cuba I realized that Abakua is empowered\
  \ by manhood; a concept that has aided in its exclusivity yet become a point of\
  \ confusion for some members. Being flexible and open to changes that occur throughout\
  \ this process is one of the strongest strengths a researcher can have. The times\
  \ where I felt frustrated, fearing that I would never gain access, were the instances\
  \ where I began to understand Cuba and what it is like to be an American abroad\
  \ researching a complex and sensitive topic."
