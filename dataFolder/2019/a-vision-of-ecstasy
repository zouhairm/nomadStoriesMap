Text: "Just after getting down from the train,  I breathed the cool morning air and\
  \ got the clue that finally I am at my destination in Murkongselek in Assam, India.\
  \ To start with, I am not a frequent traveler but whenever I do, I always make sure\
  \ it's away from everything towards a different world altogether. I am a big nature\
  \ lover so mostly my all trips are around that. so my this trip started catching\
  \ a train from Guwahati to Murkongsalek. This time the plan is to explore a bit\
  \ of the beautiful state of Arunachal Pradesh in India. This state has a vast history.\
  \ It was a Chinese territory until 1987. being traveling solo I already pre-planned\
  \ the route from this place to Mechuka, a small village in Arunachal. I booked a\
  \ cab from here to mechuka, approx 330 kms journey by car. I was thrilled with the\
  \ beauty and the natural adversity of the place. I reached to my first stop that\
  \ is pasighat on day1. In the evening  I took a room in a small lodge. this place\
  \ was amazing in all ways...clear air, awesome locale surrounded with all the natural\
  \ beauty. \n\nThe next morning I was welcomed to a fantastic view of this place\
  \ through my room. the fog covered trees, the after-rain smell in air and sound\
  \ of distant birds. Suddenly after so long I felt alive! we had our breakfast named\
  \ pitha, a local dish made of rice and almonds with red tea. after that I left for\
  \ our next destination that is Along on day2. the journey from pasighat to Along\
  \ was way too much of everything. starting from mountains views to awesome rainy\
  \ weather, this place totally amazed me. I reached Along and rested for a while.\
  \ I got to know from the locals, the place also has hiking sites. As I love hikes,\
  \ without giving second thought I went hiking not too high. after 3 hours I was\
  \ at the top! the view itself was a proof of everything was worth it. just sitting\
  \ on top and watching the town gave me a feeling of ecstasy. At this point, I was\
  \ just awed with everything. after climbing down, I was back to Along town and rested\
  \ for the night. Next day I left alone for my final destination that is Mechuka.\
  \ As moving, the climate became colder. I reached Mechuka and felt utter happiness.\
  \ After contacted the locals I got a place to stay where only an old lady owned\
  \ the house. There was so much to her story. she was only living member of the family\
  \ and her income was on a farm. what amazed me that she was always into giving free\
  \ shelter and food to travelers coming here. I had my dinner around a hearth singing\
  \ folks and a total local food. The place had only approx 5k people. what struck\
  \ me that they were so away from the world we live and yet so happy and self-satisfied.\
  \ Many have never left this village and yet there was constant happiness glowing\
  \ on their faces. That's the feeling of Ecstasy I felt.\n\n Next morning while leaving\
  \ this place, it was weird how in small span I felt a connection to this place &\
  \ the people. When I tried giving money to the lady, she politely refused. It occurred\
  \ me, maybe she did this with everyone just for the company of people. Everyone\
  \ bid my byes with big smiles. The return journey was in haze as I was still caught\
  \ in that place and those happy faces which don't need to see our world. They were\
  \ all so contained. I  guess we all live for that but rarely get it. The connection\
  \ I felt towards these people was beyond my expectation. Their simplicity captured\
  \ my thoughts. And I realized, it was not now just a trip but a journey or me that\
  \ stays with me forever. I guess some time We all need to do things that give us\
  \ a feeling of ecstasy and bring us more close to life..."
