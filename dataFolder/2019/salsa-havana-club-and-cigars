Text: "Well i planned to go to Cuba, just because I loved the song Havana by Camila\
  \ Cabello. I literally took a leap into the unknown, but it felt more like I took\
  \ a literal step back in time. I had not researched extensively, just done the basic\
  \ search on currency, language, food. Since I did't speak any Spanish when I landed,\
  \ my journey was an adventure from the word go. I met some wonderful locals and\
  \ made some great friends along the way. the locals in Cuba are so friendly & I\
  \ think the Cuban inhale Music instead of Oxygen. Everybody dances like stars &\
  \ they are so fun loving & off course the Cuban rum & cigars are the icing on the\
  \ cake. I experience the 1st Hurricane of my life while we were in Vinyales Valley,\
  \ the land of tobacco plantations, it was quite frightening & devastating. \nNatural\
  \ beauty is just amazing, the beaches the underwater life, the small towns, are\
  \ so peaceful & beautiful. I went Scuba diving in Playa Larga, the blue of the ocean\
  \ is just the thing you need to relax & rejuvenate the mind. \nMy next stop was\
  \ Trinidad, a dreamy little town full of colourful houses & cobbled streets. This\
  \ is where I did my short course to learn Salsa & my teacher was a very young man\
  \ of 19 who then took me out at nights to local salsa clubs. I went horse riding\
  \ into mountains to a national park & found the most amazing waterfalls withe cold\
  \ water which soothes your skin after riding for 3 hours in the scorching sun.\n\
  to fly out I had to come back to Havana, where we went out partying for the last\
  \ time & i got a permanent memory of Cuba, I got myself inked on an impulse with\
  \ very cliched name ' Cuba Libre'. \nthough there was no internet, atleast not unless\
  \ you got lucky enough to find a wifi card before they ran out of it, you will not\
  \ miss the internet here. You actually get in touch with people for real & not just\
  \ online.\nSo Cuba is one of the most memorable trips of my life."
