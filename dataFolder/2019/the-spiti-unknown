Text: "In the the midst of Himalyan range, I was traveling with my family. My family\
  \ knew the place but to me it was totally unknown. The only thing I knew was, the\
  \ name of the journey, and where we headed. I heard appreciations about this place,\
  \ but I decided not to search this place on the internet. I wanted to experience\
  \ it first hand. I didn't want that place to have a perception in the mind. It was\
  \ my leap of faith to a new world away from the my home. \n\nI always had a peaceful\
  \ connection with the mountains. They gave me peace and serenity. Every angle had\
  \ a different view, every step had something exotic to give me. \n\nWe crossed Shimla,\
  \ and Kinnaur, and then came a small tunnel. It was a small tunnel but when we reached\
  \ there, it looked like a skull, and we have to go through the eye of it. The rainfall\
  \ and sedimentation led to a shape of skull in my head. The view was iconic. Something\
  \ I only imagine in my dreams. \nThe sky was quite gloomy, a little dark, the skull\
  \ mount was getting quite scary, but it was an adventure I was ready to take this\
  \ adventure. We took the leap and drove slowly through the small tunnel. It was\
  \ simply an amazing experience. \n\nAfter the skull mount few kilometers away comes\
  \ the suicide point. It was a beautiful point. I think nature gave us to click picture\
  \ and enjoy the beautiful view and the endless pit where, I was quite scared to\
  \ see down. Though it is known as suicide point, there are no reports of any suicide.\
  \ The question that lingers in my mind is that, who gives these names to these places.\
  \ \n\nAfter two days of mesmerizing drive and one night stay. \n\nWe entered one\
  \ of the most mesmerizing valley in the Himachal Pradesh. The Spiti Valley! \n\n\
  Spiti Valley is simply famous for Kaza, Tabo, Temung, Chandertal Lake, Hikkim, Komic\
  \ and many more. \n\nKaza, the titled capital of Spiti Valley is a beautiful town\
  \ like village. The sweet city with sweet people. They lack with few of luxuries\
  \ of life such as proper electricity, mobile connectivity, they still were happy\
  \ and ambitious. We had a sweet talk with a souvenir shop. A lady runs that place,\
  \ she started from a street hawk and now owns a shop. She sent her daughter to Dehradun\
  \ for schooling. This shows the passion people of India have, for their children.\
  \ \nKaza has the most places nearby to go and see, If you are a hiker and would\
  \ walk everywhere, you will have to give 2 days to everything. A personal advice\
  \ rent a scooter/moped to travel in and around. \nThe main attraction here is Ki\
  \ or Key Monastery. A simple monastery is located on a hilltop and the whole small\
  \ hill is the monastery. Personally the view of the monastery is way more beautiful\
  \ than the view from the monastery. \nTabo, has the oldest monastery which was established\
  \ in 996. This is quit ancient and it is beauty with age. \nHikkim is highest post\
  \ offie there ever is, and Komic is highest village with people living there. \n\
  The most serene and peaceful view in all of Spiti is on the side way of the road\
  \ to Lantza. A Buddha looking over the west, the whole of valley. Being by the side\
  \ of the statue of Buddha gives you peace in yourself. \nThe last stage for your\
  \ Spiti expedition is the beautiful Chandratal lake. The clear blue waters, covered\
  \ by the snow-tip mountains.\n\nSpiti is a beautiful valley that leaves a mark in\
  \ you memory. A mark so strong that only the thought o fit will give all the past\
  \ pleasures. It's beauty cannot be jotted down in words or captured in a picture.\
  \ It can only be experienced and seen with your own eyes."
