Text: "I left London from Gatwick airport in a flight which destiny was a small german\
  \ airport, Frankfurt Hahn. My final destination was Kludenbach, a tiny countryside\
  \ village with a little more than 100 residents, where Astrid, my hostess, lived.\
  \ I\u2019m a Brazilian woman and, at that time, I was a PhD student in the beginning\
  \ of my thirties, living and studying in the UK as a visiting research student at\
  \ the University of Birmingham. My purpose in Europe was to carry on some research\
  \ and conduct interviews for my thesis, about a transnational feminist movement\
  \ present worldwide. \nMy first contact with Astrid happened by e-mail, when I wrote\
  \ her as the appointed national coordinator of the movement in Germany, according\
  \ to the website, introducing myself and my research and kindly asking for an interview.\
  \ The answer was not only immediate but also immensely generous. Besides their time\
  \ and voice, she offered me a place to stay, and as I found out later, her whole\
  \ hospitality. \nI wasn\u2019t really sure about what to expect and what would be\
  \ expecting me, but my first impression couldn\u2019t have been better - I felt\
  \ very welcome since minute one. Astrid was waiting for me at the airport to drive\
  \ me to her home, where I was going to spend the night and the next day for our\
  \ talk. As we arrived at her cosy cottage, she offered me a delicious dinner and\
  \ our conversation ran smoothly, until Astrid told me she played the piano and was\
  \ a big fan of a brazilian Bossa Nova musician, Tom Jobin. She left the kitchen\
  \ for a few seconds and returned with a folder full of scores of his songs, asking\
  \ me to translate the lyrics. As I was translating them, I had to explain some important\
  \ aspects of brazilian culture, and couldn\u2019t stop thinking: \u201Cwhat are\
  \ the odds of going to a small village in Germany and finding a fan of brazilian\
  \ music? And how amazing it is that art can transport worlds and promote a cultural\
  \ translation between people from far away places!\u201D After some time of a great\
  \ conversation, we went to sleep. \nIn the next morning Astrid was waiting for me\
  \ with a beautiful breakfast with many different kinds of traditional german fruit\
  \ cakes \u2013 she actually went to the bakery really early to buy them fresh! I\
  \ told her then that where I\u2019m from, in southern Brazil, because of German\
  \ colonization, these cakes are very common and popular. In Portuguese we call them\
  \ \u201Ccuca\u201D \u2013 what makes sense, as she told me, because cake in german\
  \ is called \u201CKuchen\u201D, and the pronunciation is almost the same. As I eaten\
  \ my berries \u201Ckuchen\u201D I told Agnes then that our most famous \u201Ccuca\u201D\
  \ is made with bananas, and we smiled at this very good example of the encounter\
  \ of cultures, as it was necessary, almost two centuries ago, to adapt the recipe\
  \ to a tropical fruit very common in Brazil. We finished our breakfast and Agnes\
  \ took me for a walking tour around the village, when I could then see the beauties\
  \ of the place, meet some of her friends, get to know their lifestyles and learn\
  \ a little bit more about the local culture. It felt amazing to live that contact\
  \ of cultures from the past and at the same time to think about how our realities\
  \ intertwine in the present. \nBack to the cottage, we had lunch and then gathered\
  \ to start the interview, as other two women from the movement joined us for a collective\
  \ conversation. The afternoon passed very quickly as we spoke, then Agnes stopped\
  \ us with the announcement that I had to see something. We all went then to a balcony\
  \ in the upper floor to watch one of the most incredible sunsets I had the pleasure\
  \ to witness in my life. That bucolic place, in a first glance looked liked paradise.\
  \ But after meeting those amazing fierce women and their stories, I realized that\
  \ paradise is not a place. Paradise is to find, honouring our differences and the\
  \ particularity of our cultures, a common ground to keep fighting for and believing\
  \ in a better world \u2013 for us and for everyone."
