Text: "From the doorway I watch couples spin effortlessly across the floor. My heart\
  \ rate rises; the energy of the salsa music provokes both excitement and apprehension.\
  \ Will anyone ask me to dance? How badly will I embarrass myself? Perched on a barstool,\
  \ I await the answers.\n\nI arrived to Medellin three weeks ago, where I rent a\
  \ room from a retired Colombian couple. This morning, like most, I awoke to the\
  \ avocado man selling his ripe green goods on the street below. Outside my window,\
  \ verdant palms complement the redbrick buildings that dominate the valley. Freshly\
  \ fried empanadas perfume the air and the sun shines at 75 degrees year-round. The\
  \ city of eternal spring.\_\L\n\nLast weekend an impromptu dance competition took\
  \ place in the park down the street. With glee and grace, couples age 7 to 70 transitioned\
  \ between salsa, bachata, reggaeton, merengue and cumbia. Music and dance are embedded\
  \ into daily life; it\u2019s no wonder Colombians move with such finesse. In spite\
  \ of, or perhaps because of, recent hardships, life is celebrated here. Each day\
  \ brings a promise of relationships to savor, meals to share and hips to shake.\n\
  \nMemories of the city\u2019s tumultuous past persist. Drug lord Pablo Escobar ruled\
  \ with ruthless violence until he was killed in 1993 - on the rooftop of a building\
  \ that today houses my Spanish school. Everyday, vans of narco-tourists unload across\
  \ the street to photograph the rather drab beige stucco facade. I prefer to be on\
  \ the inside, conversing with my teachers, focusing on the vibrancy of modern day\
  \ Medellin. Locals herald their hometown\u2019s ongoing transformation with an immense\
  \ pride and optimism that captivated me during a brief visit a few years ago. When\
  \ I packed up my life last month, I knew exactly where to start my own next chapter.\n\
  \nIn the club, I sip a beer and continue to observe the skilled\_salseros. I\u2019\
  ve had a handful of lessons here with a gracious professional dancer named Alejo.\_\
  \xA1Con m\xE1s sabor!\_he encourages me. With more flavor! My inner Latina is in\
  \ there, somewhere, waiting to be unleashed. Suddenly a man approaches, his hand\
  \ extended. I\u2019m just a beginner, I explain. Me too, he replies with a smile.\_\
  \n\nIn salsa it\u2019s easier to follow than to lead; the man\u2019s role is to\
  \ call the shots and ensure his partner knows what to do. As a single, independent\
  \ woman I\u2019m unaccustomed to relinquishing control like this, but it sure helps\
  \ on the dance floor. I\u2019ve discovered that a bit of surrender, a quieting of\
  \ the ego, lets me more deeply experience new places and languages, new ways of\
  \ living and moving. For now, I am glad to be in his hands.\n\nSoy Juan, he introduces\
  \ himself. I\u2019m far from his ideal partner, a salsa novice with several inches\
  \ on him to boot. But for the next couple of hours he\u2019s a loyal and patient\
  \ lead, taking this\_gringa\_out to dance every few songs and showing off his advanced\
  \ moves in between. My mediocre Spanish precludes much verbal exchange but as we\
  \ step together with the music, and laugh together when I stumble, a friendship\
  \ is born nonetheless.\n\nWhen the music stops Juan asks if I\u2019d like to meet\
  \ some friends at another nearby venue. I tag along and I\u2019m surprised to find\
  \ my salsa instructor Alejo inside. It\u2019s good to see you here, he says with\
  \ a kiss on the cheek, as if it were natural to end up in the same club out of the\
  \ multitude in Medellin. This city feels smaller every day.\n\nShortly after midnight\
  \ Juan helps me into a taxi with a vow that we\u2019ll dance again soon. From the\
  \ backseat I watch the surrounding hillsides sparkle as songs from the night echo\
  \ in my head. Home in the apartment, my phone reconnects to WiFi. Among the missed\
  \ messages from earlier in the evening is one from Alejo, an invitation to join\
  \ him exactly where we\u2019d run into each other. I lie in bed smiling at the serendipity,\
  \ charmed by the warm welcome.  \n\uFFFC\nNo one even knew that it was my birthday."
