Text: "How hard could it be? There is a picture with a high heel shoe and an \u201C\
  X\u201D through it. We brought proper footwear. We survived a long bike trip through\
  \ Thailand without training. Plus, my friend Pamellia has an advantage. Smokers\
  \ acclimate easier to higher altitudes than non-smokers. So, it\u2019s settled!\
  \ We sign up to hike Mount Stromboli, one of earth\u2019s most active volcanos located\
  \ on a small island off the coast of Sicily. \n\nWe arrive at the meeting point\
  \ mixed with excitement and a bit of nervousness. We are the only Americans in the\
  \ group. I do a quick assessment and it looks like a strong, fit bunch. There are\
  \ two children doing the hike which makes me feel a bit better about our chances.\
  \ The guide points out a \u201Cturnaround spot\u201D on the map where you can head\
  \ back if you feel you cannot make it to the top. I make a mental note of that point.\
  \ We are given hard hats (interesting), a headlamp for the descent in the dark and\
  \ a mask to cover our mouths. Apparently with active volcanos comes sandy terrain\
  \ and dust. With backpacks full of water, snacks and an extra layer of clothing,\
  \ we head off in single file along the narrow path. It wasn\u2019t long before we\
  \ felt the heaviness in our chests and backpacks (why did we pack so much water)\
  \ and started to fall behind the rest of the group. The tour guide stops and gets\
  \ on his walkie talkie. He says a bunch of Italian words, then I hear \"due americani\"\
  , then more Italian words. We are summoned to the front of the line. The guide hands\
  \ me his hiking stick and we proceed. I try to ignore the stares and grumblings\
  \ from the others behind us. Your group is only as fast as your slowest hiker. We\
  \ were the ugly Americans slowing everyone down! \n\nWhen we reached the point of\
  \ no return, I tell the guide we would turn back so as not to hold up the group,\
  \ but he would not hear of it. He was determined to get us to the top. And he had\
  \ a timetable to keep. Get to the top by sunset so you could enjoy the lava fireworks\
  \ display best viewed in the dark before heading down. After several water and oxygen\
  \ breaks, scenic photo stops and the occasional pull up the mountain by my hiking\
  \ stick \u2013 we made it! Red-faced and panting, we were relieved to get to the\
  \ top. But at least the worst was over! We could enjoy the bubbling florescent orange\
  \ cauldron before us. How exciting to be so close to something so dangerous.\n\n\
  I wish I could say the hike down was easier, but the terrain was totally different.\
  \ With each step our foot sunk into sand. Every time we lifted our foot and planted\
  \ the next foot you slide downhill in the sand. It felt like a mix of walking in\
  \ deep snow and skiing. Our group was quickly disappearing in front of us and nobody\
  \ seemed to notice. It was getting darker as the group got farther ahead and our\
  \ dim headlights were not cutting it. Slow and steady, one foot in front of the\
  \ other, we were making our way down in the dark. Then suddenly I started losing\
  \ my footing and the sand was giving out from under me. I started to feel like I\
  \ was sledding down the hill. I yelled to Pamellia, \u201Cstay left, stay left\u201D\
  \ as my body was pulIing right. I stabbed the sand with my hiking stick to stop\
  \ my momentum, then slowly sidestepped to the left to get back on the trail \u2013\
  \ and I use the word trail loosely. Tired, sore, dirty, sweaty and a bit shaken,\
  \ we were relieved to see our guide. He collected our gear and asked where we were\
  \ going out afterwards. I looked at him as if he was crazy and said \u2013 \u201C\
  Out? I\u2019m hoping I can make it back to my bed.\u201D"
