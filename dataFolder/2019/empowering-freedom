Text: "A little japanese girl from a small town in Brazil who can barely talk to people,\
  \ for she is really shy, takes up english classes because she is a learning addicted.\
  \ She falls in love with all the opportunities that speaking the universal language\
  \ can bring her, and she finds out there\u2019s a whole world to explore when her\
  \ teacher, who has lived abroad and traveled the world, starts telling her stories\
  \ about it. Her eyes shine. She starts dreaming about the unknown. And she so deeply\
  \ wishes to see what is there outside the borders of her reality. She\u2019s fourteen\
  \ years old, and she\u2019s never met any other girl her age who has traveled abroad.\n\
  One fine day, the Universe sends her a take it or leave it invitation. Her teacher,\
  \ who has been inspiring her with all those travel stories, is now planning a trip\
  \ to the UK and decided to take 4 students with them. Her eyes shine bright, her\
  \ mind blows and her soul knows: if she can do this, she can do anything. So she\
  \ grabs it with all her heart, but would her parents dive into the wilderness with\
  \ her? Would they support this crazy idea? Well, she was quiet and shy and small\
  \ but she sure could be compelling when she really wanted something. And her parents\
  \ knew she was like a little bird, longing to spread her wings into freedom.  And\
  \ so she took a leap into the unknown with her inspirational teacher, and that was\
  \ the day that the little girl gave place to the unbeatable girl who cultivates\
  \ her dreams and believes in the power of a true desire. It was hard though, to\
  \ feel the grandiosity of the world on her own skin. She cried for she was homesick,\
  \ but then she regreted having wasted time crying. What is a girl without the dualities?\
  \ \nAfter this experience, she became the inspiration for other girls around her\
  \ to go see the world too. And right now, seventeen years later, she is planning\
  \ a trip to the UK with the same teacher that inspired her back then, who now happens\
  \ to be her best friend and is being inspired back by her. What is life if not a\
  \ giving and receiving cicle? Give love and you\u2019ll get love in return. What\
  \ girls really need to become empowered and empower other girls if not love, education,\
  \ inspiration and support? May each one of us inspire, love and support one another.\
  \ We can do it \U0001F4AA\U0001F3FB."
