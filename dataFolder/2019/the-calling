Text: "I kept seeking it. I found myself leaving the work I thought I loved, escaping\
  \ the metropolis to drink in the peaceful quiet of nature. At night I would be tortured\
  \ by the sounds of the dark city that had battered my soul; my broken heart draped\
  \ protectively over the bruises that went unseen when I walked the streets in the\
  \ daytime. I felt called to leave, but I wasn't sure where. \n\nI  met a boy named\
  \ Cody who would take me out of the city to ski on the small mountains north of\
  \ Toronto. I wanted to go further; Australia seemed far enough away to start fresh\
  \ without constantly looking over my shoulder, but Cody told me I should see my\
  \ own country before venturing out internationally. At night I would lie awake in\
  \ be and think what I would ever do if I saw my ex Sam with his entourage of fighters,\
  \ and during the day I started to plan my trip out West. Cody wasn't incredibly\
  \ smart, but at that point all I needed was comfort and his sweet nature made up\
  \ for the shortcomings that I found so incredibly irritating. \n\nWhen I was interviewed\
  \ for the job at the ski resort they asked me what made me choose Lake Louise. \"\
  A reputable snow school\", I lied, and made up two other generic reasons. I just\
  \ wanted to get out of the rat race, I didn't care where I went. I got the job.\
  \ \n\nTwo years, that's what I said when I left. I got rid of my things and joined\
  \ Cody in the front seat of the truck; the bench style allowed me to sleep on his\
  \ lap during the long nights on the road.  \n\nI didn't expect to find myself in\
  \ a bobsleigh sliding 120 km/hr on ice with the Jamaican bobsleigh team 12 months\
  \ later."
