Text: "In the heat of the day, the paint felt cold on my skin. The local tribal women\
  \ were called to action by our camp director who instructed them to bring any paint\
  \ they could find. We could not communicate with them as they did not speak English,\
  \ but their eyes showed excitement for what was about to happen.\n\nMy nerves occupied\
  \ my mind more than the extreme soreness that encapsulated my legs. In between the\
  \ Recovery Bush Walk and the Awards Banquet the schedule had read Free Time. And\
  \ fortunately for me, I was placed in the one camp where the runners had a curious\
  \ mind and a bigger heart.\n\nI am not exactly sure how it all happened. Suddenly,\
  \ I am sitting out on the grass by the pool with all the other runners. A middle\
  \ school teacher is frantically attempting to phonetically write out the Ndebele\
  \ and Zulu words as the camp leader bellows out the soulful lyrics. We only had\
  \ 2 hours to memorize the words and get prepared.\n\nI had just run my first marathon.\
  \ It had high elevation, sand blasting wind (my legs were bleeding!), knee high\
  \ sand, and a mountain so steep even walking it seemed impossible. Did I mention\
  \ the fear of being eaten by a lion? As accomplished as I felt crossing the finish\
  \ line, my biggest source of pride was yet to come.\n\nWe decided as a group to\
  \ show up late to the festivities. We even stopped to see a few rhinos along the\
  \ way. As the sun set over Entabeni National Park, everyone in the three safari\
  \ trucks looked at each other and nodded. It was show time.\n\nSince we were the\
  \ last camp to show, our trucks were parked at the back. We could hear the music\
  \ blasting from the open aired dining room. We quietly got into line. Our camp leader\
  \ went first to tell the DJ to lower the music and then she gave us the signal.\n\
  \nHands on the shoulders of the person in front of you. Step. Toe. Step. Heal. Step.\
  \ Toe. Step Heal.\n\n\u201CShoshaloza.\u201D\n\nThe call had been started.\n\n\u201C\
  Shoshaloza. Kulezo ntaba. Stimela siphume Entabeni.\u201D\n\nAs I finished the first\
  \ lines I entered the dining room. Everyone was staring in disbelief. But the most\
  \ affected was the staff. Some were holding their hearts. Others were crying. But\
  \ they were all singing. \n\nWe made our way to the make shift dance floor. At this\
  \ point, a sense of pride had filled the room. The once timid singing of our camp\
  \ had turned into the soulful bellows heard previously from our camp leader. The\
  \ workers had made their way to the stage. We were all singing arm in arm. \n\n\
  And for a moment, as different as our cultures are, we were one."
