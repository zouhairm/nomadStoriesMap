Text: "\u201CSee, taste and take\u201D NAANA KUMIWA ABDULAI (making a local connection)\n\
  \n \u201CTravel and see\u201D is a common parlance in Ghana. So for me, it was see,\
  \ take and taste on my trip.  My photo camera was indispensable. This trip from\
  \ Accra to Kumasi in Ghana was very important to me. It was to witness the funeral\
  \ of the Queen mother of the Ashanti Kingdom. \n  Am used to the vehicular traffic,\
  \ bustle and hustle in the city of Accra. It granted me the opportunity to take\
  \ photographs of Ghanaians at their busy selves; hawkers and walkers.\n At the bus\
  \ terminal, I sat at the back seat closest to the window in the thirty six seater\
  \ bus. In my attempt to take a shot of a woman selling colourful looking crabs in\
  \ a glass container, I pushed the windows slightly with my hand out.\n Oh my God!\
  \ I had throng of hawkers rush to the side of my window. I guess my hand made the\
  \ wrong gesture. \nAll sorts of Ghanaian food delicacies in my face; try the well-\
  \ steamed and spicy crabs glazed with onion and fried yam. Hmm\u2026 should I buy\
  \ and crab my way in the bus? \nGrilled clams on sticks with sliced tomatoes and\
  \ onions. Lots of spicy food for hungry souls on the streets of Accra. \nThen my\
  \ favourite, \u201C banfo bissi\u201D the \u201C bandsmen nut\u201D made from cornflour\
  \ mixed with sugar, fried in an oval shape with groundnuts decorated around it;\
  \ brownish and crispy. I called for four.\n I took more shots of grinning hawkers\
  \ but had spicy crabs on my mind. I excitedly bought four medium sized crabs. \n\
  Then came a melodious voice! Bro\u2026kiii\u2026naa.\u201D Bottled chilled millet\
  \ and fresh cow milk drinks in a glass container   meandering on the head of a beautiful\
  \ hawker. I paid for two and the bus took off.\n   At this time my taste buds were\
  \ already submerged in the \u201CBrokiinaa\u201D. I viewed the passing scenes of\
  \ high rise buildings predominant in our cities now. Then a husky voice drew my\
  \ attention back into the bus.\nA drug peddler. A lanky man, all sleeved up, neck-\
  \ tied with \u201Ccoolly high\u201D (cap) on.  He sold two drugs; one for relieving\
  \ baldness and other from ringworm.  \nHe preached about the effectiveness of his\
  \ drugs confidently.  A few convinced passengers started to buy. I was not convinced.\
  \ Something did not sit well with me. I had my empty \u201Cbrokiiina\u201D bottle\
  \ in hand. Pensively, I hit it against my bag and all attention turned to me.\n\u201C\
  What about you\u2026do you use the drugs yourself? I took him by surprise.  \n\u201C\
  What do you mean? \n\u201CHave you used the drug on your baldness? I asked him again.\n\
  \ \u201CHow do you know I am bald? He asked sheepishly.\n\u201CPlease remove your\
  \ \u201Ccoolly high\u201D  and prove me wrong\u201D. I asked and some passengers\
  \ started clapping saying \u201Cremove! Remove!\n Ah! It was fun but he gave me\
  \ a look of disdain.\n A man by his side gently removed the cap from his head. A\
  \ spontaneous laughter erupted. \nHow come a bald headed man sold pomade for hair\
  \ growth?  He sighed and confessed that he was jobless and needed to work.  There\
  \ was an applause for his candidness as others bought the drugs. He smiled and gave\
  \ me a thumbs up. I smiled back. \nHe told passengers I was an observant person.\
  \ I made some new friends.\nWhat I did not observed though was the sudden heavy\
  \ rain that welcomed me in the night in  Kumasi.   I got soaked to the bone and\
  \ whisked into a standby taxi to my hotel in Buokrom.\nI opened the windows of a\
  \ faulty air conditioned room. I remembered an unfinished business; my spicy crabs\
  \ and fried yam deep in my bag. In warm clothes and clean hands, I attacked the\
  \ crabs with gentle force of a hungry woman. \nWith the sound of rain drops in the\
  \ background, my mind transitioned to the next day event;  funeral of the queen\
  \ mother of Ashanti Kingdom. The display of royalty, beautiful culture and history\
  \ and sumptuous varieties of food of the Ashantes would be rife. And I sure would\
  \ see, take and taste everything on display."
