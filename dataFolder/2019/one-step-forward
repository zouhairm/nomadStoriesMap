Text: "It was as though I came to Dubare from Bangalore just to meet him, it was love\
  \ at first sight after an adventurous thrilling jeep safari through the muddy, steepy,\
  \ narrow roads, I stepped out of the Jeep with a dusty face, I could hear the gushing\
  \ sound of Cauvery flowing at its best. I had to cross her stepping on slippery\
  \ stones, sandy water finally, for a journey about 15 minutes... I reach Dubare\
  \ with wet pants on barefoot and my side bag carrying my Chappals.\nI reached, \
  \ I happened to see his cousins bath, as I went on I met his cousin brother Akash\
  \ who was busy having his Breakfast, then I inquired him how he was doing? He said\
  \ that he was doing well... and our simple conversation ended with a bye... I left\
  \ .....!! As I went I saw one with his utmost simplicity and his gentleness which\
  \ made me fall for him, I stood there and admired and my heart skipped a beat and\
  \ I  went closer and my hands shivered to hold his hand as it was my first time\
  \ then slowly  got used to, Finally I asked what his name was and he smiled and\
  \ I blushed  and his name was Shubhash...he was 37 years old. He weighs 7-8 Tonnes\
  \ and he needs 250 -350 kilos of food for each meal. This big gentleman stole my\
  \ Heart...\n  Hope it was intresting if you wanna find one Shubash just like the\
  \ way I did ... Visit Dubare elephant camp on the banks of River Cauvery in Coorg...\n\
  It is the nearest hill station from Bangalore and a perfect place for all adventure\
  \ seekers and kids who wish to see elephants."
