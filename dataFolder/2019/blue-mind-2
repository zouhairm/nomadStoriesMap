Text: "As the last bar closes in Riego del agua Street, I can feel my heart like a\
  \ time bomb, the clock is running very fast, so fast that I am sure in any moment\
  \ it will explode. Sometimes it's crazy how time flies and you can't control it.\
  \ No matter how many times you try that clock is watching every step, and then,\
  \ it comes the explosion and everything, and I mean everything, falls apart. \n\n\
  This is the second time we run into each other, but for me it is not longer a coincidence.\
  \ He is waiting but also very close to me. I look into his eyes, blue, intense and\
  \ full of secrets. I know I've seen these eyes before, but where? Where?\n\nLately\
  \ my mind is confused and lost, trapped between reality and dreams. I feel that\
  \ right sometimes is wrong, and wrong, well, wrong is just wrong. Ever since I arrived\
  \ in Coru\xF1a I felt inspired, surrounded by the sea and the small octopus restaurants,\
  \ but also the colors, the costumes and the magic of the carnival.\n\nHundreds of\
  \ people around the small streets, singing and dancing. In every step the wind is\
  \ playing its own music. All the movement make me think that beauty can be strangely\
  \ various, but nothing is more captivating than that man and his blue eyes. I know\
  \ him, I know him. \n\nWhen the bar finally closes, I begin to walk quickly among\
  \ the people, I can tell that he is following me. Again this damn clock , my mind\
  \ like mixed drinks. He advances with slower steps. I am able to recognize his perfume,\
  \ very strong but also addictive, orange and lavender. I know this perfume but who\
  \ is him? Who?\n\nI'm losing it, my mind always turns like this when wants to forget\
  \ something but I want to remember. I keep walking because that's what I do, when\
  \ I don't know what else to do, run, escape, forget, let the rhythm of the music\
  \ hug me, the trumpets, the guitars, his steps behind me, the clock, my very accelerated\
  \ pulse, the intensity of every breath. It is like the strong rhythm of Coru\xF1\
  a's Carnival and his footsteps are connected.\n\n When I look back he is not longer\
  \ there and I am trapped between arms, legs, shoulders, so many people around that\
  \ I can even feel a man\u2019s teeth sinking into my neck. I start to run, I want\
  \ to be brave this time. I need to know who he is. My mind won't win. I keep running,\
  \ the time seem to stop in slow and soft intervals, if it is not for the carnival\
  \ and the whole movement, people might think that I am crazy, but I need to find\
  \ him, talk to him, be brave. Win. \n\nAlmost out of breath I stop. I close my eyes\
  \ letting the wind flow in my face. I am close to Riazor beach. I walk on the coarse\
  \ sand, feeling the salt that slip in my eyes. I can only think about his eyes and\
  \ my eyes, his hands and my hands. Our bodies. Louis!\n\nSuddenly I remember who\
  \ he is and why our story no matter where I travel always ends like this. Finding\
  \ him but also losing him is the end of all the games of my mind, this time with\
  \ sea foam in my hands I am ready to remember and move on. I won't forget his blue\
  \ eyes, just our bad memories. So I walk, I look at the sea and the music comes\
  \ again, soft, infinite, touching me forever like morning coffee, like good memories."
