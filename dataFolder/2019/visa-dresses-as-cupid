  \ to the speed of \u2018you are going to lose a flight\u2019. Another one. For the\
  \ life of me, Angelica, lets just make it. The tiny rocks of the street sped below\
  \ our feet.\_We bargain the taxi price. We could not lose a minute as much as we\
  \ were not willing to lose a rupiah. By principle, as Daniel used to say.\n\nWe\
  \ had already lost a flight. We were in Kathmandu, which I think is the coolest\
  \ name a city could have. Kat, for Catalina, my name, and for Cats. Du for the mystic\
  \ sound and the action of just doing. The city itself, chaotic particles of dust.\
  \ People, as friendly as a person can be. Pomegranate juice tinted our mouths in\
  \ the late mornings, looking through the ceiling mirror in the closest fruit store.\
  \ This was our life, after the most demanding trekking I had ever done. Annapurna\
  \ circuit. 5,419 meters high the pass.\_\n\nAngelica and me, we are friends. Traveling\
  \ nomads when time allows it. We tend to do last minute, improvised but exciting\
  \ choices. For example, doing our visa application to India on the way to the mountain.\
  \ Got the granted notification during the trekking. Himalayan wifi, my friends.\
  \ All set for when we got back. Or so we thought.\_\n\nMainly, it was me and Angelica,\
  \ but we had met Daniel along the way. We had our las Dahl and said goodbye in Kathmandu.\
  \ Sad, but not that much. There is something about goodbyes that warms my heart.\
  \ Feel what you might in the anticipation of departure. The next day we go to the\
  \ airport. \u201CYes please, Where are you traveling to?\u201D The Small middle\
  \ aged man asks. \u201CIndia\u201D I say.\_ Ok, passports and visa\u201D. I give\
  \ him the phone and documents. \u201CLady, this is wrong number\u201D . \u201CWhat\
  \ do you mean?\u201D \u201CWrong number, not the same ID as passport, so not same\
  \ person\u201D. I turned and looked wide eyed to Angelica. Panic. Her expression\
  \ serene. She hands her documents with precise hand movements. To our surprise,\
  \ her last digits were out of place too. Flames came out of the floor. One hour\
  \ until the flight. Just stress and running, trying to fix this problem. The best\
  \ option was to go to the Indian embassy, fast. In the crazy traffic of Nepal, there\
  \ we were, standing as humans cones as the driver changed the Flat tire. Nothing\
  \ they could do at the Indian embassy, so we just have to apply again. As we spoke,\
  \ we had survived to at least three chances of dying.\_ \nWe bought a pineapple\
  \ and took it to the park, a bird decided to let go of what not longer serves and\
  \ lands in our plate. At that point, we were just laughing.\n\nThe new visa authorization\
  \ came faster than we thought. We bought a new airplane ticket for the morning after.\
  \ As there was not a reason not to celebrate we went out for beers. Cheers to the\
  \ one lesson I learned. There are actions you wish you would have done differently,\
  \ but when it is done and time is on its way, you can only choose your attitude.\
  \ Soon the laughter changed into kisses and soon, Angelica was kissing Daniel and\
  \ I found a new lover. \n\nOne long blink and we are back to that morning. Angelica\
  \ wakes up where the sun rises, on the other side of the city.\_\nAs my eyelid opens,\
  \ I take in the image of Angelica panting, from running and from the stairs in our\
  \ 5th floor hostel, nervous by not knowing what time it was, red and full of life.\
  \ Get up girl, we need to catch a flight! The Nepalese mountains through that airplane\
  \ window was the most marvelous sight. Our eyes on the blue wall, our hands in friends\
  \ hands and lovers in our heart."
