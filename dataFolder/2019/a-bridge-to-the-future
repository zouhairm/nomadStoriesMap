Text: "After crossing the border from Croatia into Bosnia and Hercegovina, Mostar,\
  \ a former small village set in a deep valley on the Neretva river, was about to\
  \ provide an in-depth history lesson, as well as an appreciation of what both nature\
  \ and reconciliation can collectively produce .\n\nThe Old Bridge (Stari Most) constructed\
  \ in 1566 during the Ottoman Empire, once linked the former capital of Hercegovina.\n\
  It somewhat abruptly became the centrepiece of a divided society, country and region.\
  \ \n\nAs the sun begins to set on a glistening summer evening, I stare up toward\
  \ the bridge from the rocks on the bank. Local (professionally trained) thrill seekers\
  \ prepare to make their leap; tourists watch, donate and wait in anticipation. The\
  \ semi- translucent waters of the lightly dull green river flow quickly, my appreciation\
  \ for everything grows, I\u2019m lost in thought for no apparent reason. \n\nThis\
  \ very bridge, along with most of the town, was destroyed in November 1993 by Bosnian\
  \ Croat forces during a heavy artillery shelling. Through a collective effort it\
  \ was restored using authentic materials, and to historical specifications, to be\
  \ reopened in 2004.\n\nI wander back over the bridge and begin to discover the Old\
  \ Bazaar (Kujundziluk) \u2013 full of market stalls in addition to colourful Turkish\
  \ houses and shops. As I stopped to buy a \u0107evapi \u2013 I was questioned on\
  \ my ethnicity by the shop owner, had I crossed to the wrong side of the bridge?\
  \ This, for me, was just a minor step back in time and cultural beliefs.\n\nI wind\
  \ my way through the neglected back streets of Mostar, taking notice of the building\
  \ structures and designs; some colourful and untouched, some the opposite, many\
  \ a mixture. This representation, in some way, reflected not only the city, but\
  \ the country at this particular time. \n\nBack at the hostel, the owner, a native\
  \ Bosnian, didn\u2019t have to use any persuasive skills in convincing me to join\
  \ him, and other travellers, on a tour out of Mostar the next day. \n\nOur small\
  \ group, made up of three nationalities (one American, three French and one Australian)\
  \ depart the hostel in respectful anticipation.\n\nThe buildings around and out\
  \ of Mostar paint a different picture to the green, cliff laden landscape and Turkish\
  \ houses prevalent in the old Bridge area. \nBullet holes and structural damage\
  \ a far too regular reminder of not so many years ago, especially in the most affected\
  \ battle spots. \n\nOur guide, who was a young adult at 17 years of age when the\
  \ Bosnian War broke out, educates us as we commute to our first stop \u2013 Blagaj\
  \ Tekija \u2013 an old Muslim village with a dervish Monastery located at the base\
  \ of a towering cliff face.  As a group we stop for breakfast \u2013 a choice of\
  \ two traditional Bosnian bureks, we inquire about the village, learn and prepare\
  \ for our next stop and hope that our heavy breakfast somewhat digests before we\
  \ plunge into waters later in the afternoon. \n\nOur next stop is Po\u010Ditelj\
  \ \u2013 a walled village steeped in history. Po\u010Ditelj possesses two main towers\
  \ \u2013 a clock tower (sahat kula) and a fortress tower. Whilst climbing the mountain\
  \ towards the fortress, we passed traditional Turkish baths (hamam), The Hajji Alijia\
  \ Mosque and numerous Mediterranean style buildings which locals still reside in.\
  \ \n\nWe finally reach the pinnacle \u2013 Citadel Po\u010Ditelj is a medieval tower\
  \ with views over the town. The fort was used as a military watch tower during the\
  \ Bosnian war. The old town of Po\u010Ditelj, just like the Stari Most, are both\
  \ UNESCO World Heritage Sites now. \n\nTo conclude our trip we spent time swimming\
  \ in the clear and refreshing waters of the secluded Kravica Waterfalls. Picture\
  \ a green wilderness, occupied centrally by cascading waterfalls surrounding the\
  \ natural, circular like formation. \n\nAs my pre-frozen water bottle acts as my\
  \ air-conditioning upon boarding the bus to Sarajevo the following day, my thoughts\
  \ lie not just in the knowledge I have obtained about Mostar, but about what lies\
  \ ahead whilst continuing to discover this country.\n \nThe bus trip is something\
  \ else, Sarajevo is a story itself, but Mostar has provided the shiny platform that\
  \ bond the past and the present with a positive connection to the future."
