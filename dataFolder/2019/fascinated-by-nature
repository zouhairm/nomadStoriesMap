Text: "I live where the water hates to visit. So when I see a flowing stream at the\
  \ bottom of an Oak Creek picnic area, I jump for joy at the thought of dipping my\
  \ feet into the wavy stream as it winds its way into the forest. The temperatures\
  \ are cooler than the ones I am used to and the forest is filled with aromas from\
  \ the barbecue pits surrounding the stream.\n\nMy eyes travel downstream, looking\
  \ at the rocks that bring the shine of the water in a way that feels homely.\n\n\
  I feel like giggling. As far from it as I am, I feel at home.\n\nThe sight of children\
  \ diving into the stream, screaming and laughing in appreciation to the creator\
  \ gives me an urge to join the celebration. My former supervisor, Lelanie Seyffer,\
  \ draws my attention to a more serene spot that is a few yards away.\n\nIt is the\
  \ grand Canyon. \n\nThe Canyon has magnificent, immense and stunningly beautiful\
  \ features of the hilly Northern Arizona. The moment I got closer to the great Grand\
  \ Canyon, I was struck by its beauty. Its layered bands of red rock revealing millions\
  \ of geological histories kept me silent for a while. The sound of wind blowing\
  \ from all directions of the Grand Canyon and the \u201Cwows\u201D and \u201Cwhat\u201D\
  \ expressions from the vast number of tourists standing at every point around the\
  \ Grand Canyon showed me how majestic\u200A\u2014\u200Athis landmark was\n\nI was\
  \ blown away by its powerful yet soft feel and it\u2019s beautiful yet overwhelming\
  \ features.\n\nI had never seen anything like that before. And as we all basked\
  \ away in the glory of the magnificent canyon, I considered myself lucky that I\
  \ was involved in an Internship that gave me a chance to meet new people and fascinating\
  \ creations like the great Grand Canyon."
