Text: "A young lady in her early 20's decides to go for adventures chasing the road\
  \ of her dream to be a wandering traveller. Sounds impressive, but scary for any\
  \ family, who brought up a girl in Caucasus. The overprotective care is priceless,\
  \ but breaking the cage should be the beginning of a new world, new life and new\
  \ discoveries. Travelling only 275 kilometres far on a shuttle did not promise to\
  \ be a life changing experience, everything was supposed to feel similar or the\
  \ same in a small region with warm-hearted people called South Caucasus. While life\
  \ had a different flow of events prepared for my impatient soul. Heartbeats get\
  \ faster and I step on the ground of Georgian land, in an Armenian district, where\
  \ my ancestors have been living peacefully with locals for several centuries. I\
  \ do feel a guest at my own home. Armenian church nearby and sounds of a buzzing\
  \ city on a regular Thursday afternoon fill my soul with hunger of discoveries.\
  \ \nTourism agents everywhere, souvenir shops, locals walking confidently and tourists\
  \ digging the maps all come together to make the image of Tbilisi, a city where\
  \ trade is a skill everyone is born with. The famous concept of elevator pitch can't\
  \ even compete with the five-second pitch Georgians have mastered in attracting\
  \ foreigners.  \nWalking down the narrow streets of Old Tbilisi should take you\
  \ to a suspicious trip, confusing your mind whether you walk near the ancient baths\
  \ of old Georgia or seek a couple of modern backgrounds for your Instagram stories.\
  \ While sights and views differ not only in times, but styles and colours it takes\
  \ some attention to explore both sides of the road and end up near a small but loud\
  \ waterfall and admire it while getting the notes of famous songs of Metallica and\
  \ Scorpions played so gently one can't even guess it has been a piece of rock music\
  \ initially.\nThe city goes in its ordinary routine and soon when the twilight covers\
  \ the buildings and the air smells like wine youth takes the whole activity to a\
  \ different level of joy and fun. Parties all over the city, every cafe and winery\
  \ vibes with its unique style. While non-party-ers want to stop here, I have something\
  \ for them too. You can get a couple of khachapuris and cheburekis (traditional\
  \ pies of Georgia) and head to one of the parks, calm streets, squares or to your\
  \ room and enjoy the rest of the euphoria there, while you still are discovering\
  \ the country. Being in your room does not isolate you from the culture, it helps\
  \ you see the \"home\" side of it, meaning you will see a local, who will greet\
  \ you with warm gamarjoba genacvale (hello dear) and will offer to help if you look\
  \ confused. Locals speak a universal language of hospitality, no matter what's your\
  \ mother tongue, they'll find a way to answer your question or ask you one. \nTbilisi\
  \ is home to everyone, a country which has a language with no capital letters treats\
  \ people equally, just as the letters."
