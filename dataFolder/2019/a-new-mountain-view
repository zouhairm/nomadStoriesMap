Text: "Mist kissed the mountainside as light cracked through a frosty morning in northern\
  \ China. It had been over three weeks since I had arrived in Beijing and made my\
  \ way by rail to a Buddhist monastery far from the city\u2019s outskirts. I had\
  \ come to China with 60 others as part of a four-week, immersive program designed\
  \ to introduce English speakers to Chinese Buddhist culture. Now in our third and\
  \ final monastery nestled southwest of the nation\u2019s capital on Mount Wutai,\
  \ I had become accustomed to the routine that had only recently felt unfamiliar.\
  \ \n\nIn comparison to some of China's densely populated metropolitan epicenters,\
  \ my glimpse into the country had been punctuated by fresh vegan meals, hand washed\
  \ linen uniforms, and awakening at 5:30 AM to the sound of the wooden fish \u2013\
  \ a percussion instrument unique to Chinese Buddhist ritual. Even though our program\
  \ curriculum had included daily meditation, I knew as I entered the final week of\
  \ my stay that these periods of silence would become intimidating as we prepared\
  \ to spend the next five days fully immersed in silent meditation.\n\nWhile \"meditation\"\
  \ and \"mindfulness\" are now buzzwords often accompanied by idealized imagery,\
  \ as the consistent silence settled around us, I was crushed beneath a weight of\
  \ overwhelming emotion. We had been warned that, like a dam, distractions help hold\
  \ unresolved feelings and avoided internal conflict at bay. Without that barrier,\
  \ my undistracted mind was left gasping, frustrated, and hypersensitive to the world\
  \ around me. I further grappled with a feeling of contradiction: I had always thought\
  \ that international travel was about connecting with other people and cultures,\
  \ but how was I to do that if I was not allowed to write to another human being\
  \ let alone speak? For two days I sat on my mat expecting peace but feeling agonizingly\
  \ uncomfortable. \n\nAs we reached the crest of our wordless week, my emotions began\
  \ to settle. I started to see the world around me with sharp appreciation and came\
  \ to view this piece of my international experience differently. Yes, visiting new\
  \ countries was about exposure to different ways of life; it was also, though, about\
  \ allowing inevitable challenges help aid personal growth. I began to ask myself\
  \ the critical questions that all travelers should grapple with: Was I traveling\
  \ to grow or escape? Did I value experiences that could be captured in a picture\
  \ more than those could never be explained? Did I need a rigid plan or could I allow\
  \ myself to submerge elbows-deep in messy uncertainty?  \n\nEven as we reached the\
  \ culmination of our week \u2013 a 300-step pilgrimage up to one of Mount Wutai's\
  \ peaks \u2013 I contemplated the importance of building an authentic connection\
  \ with oneself before expecting to make connections with others. Though not all\
  \ of my questions had been answered, as we summited into broken silence, I stood\
  \ in appreciative stillness of the emotional and physical steps that had taken me\
  \ much farther than halfway around the globe. \n\nOn our final day, my cohort explored\
  \ the populated parts of the mountain - unsuccessfully attempting to explain to\
  \ each other all that we had experienced - until the sun hung low and heavy above\
  \ concave roofs. A group of us raced back before curfew, laughing with hands full\
  \ of bags of steaming, fresh dumplings. Scrambling up to the monastery roof, we\
  \ sat together watching the sunset-kissed peaks for the last time. Though we could\
  \ have spoken, it was in that moment that we finally understood that our silence\
  \ said more than enough."
