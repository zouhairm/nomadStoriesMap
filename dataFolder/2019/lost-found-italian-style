Text: "No wonder travelers get lost. One vacationer\u2019s Florence is another\u2019\
  s Firenze.\nBombay becomes Mumbai. In northwest Spain signs are in Basque, which\
  \ is completely incomprehensible  for someone with rudimentary Berlitz Spanish For\
  \ Travelers.\n\nI had arrived mid-day on a Friday at Milan\u2019s or is that Milano\u2019\
  s old Linate airport and called my supplier in Veneto as previously arranged. He\
  \ politely suggested that as it was Friday perhaps I should spend the weekend in\
  \ Venice. We could meet to discuss on Monday. He had graciously made a reservation\
  \ for me at the Bauer Grunwald Hotel. All I had to do was get to Venice.\n\nI did\
  \ not have a flight reserved, so I attempted to make arrangements to fly to Venice.\n\
  Italians, I discovered have an aversion to standing in orderly lines. Joining other\
  \ travelers, I crowded about the Alitalia Reservations counter to try to determine\
  \ what was available. When I finally nudged and elbowed my way to the reservation\
  \ window I was told that the only flight to Venice that day was already fully booked.\n\
  \nMy only option was to take the train to Venice taking the air[port shuttle bus\
  \ to the railway station.\n\n\nThankfully, shuttle buses depart frequently.  Moving\
  \ quickly along the autostrada towards the city, I felt I had plenty of time and\
  \ began to relax. However, once the bus entered the city limits my anxiety level\
  \ began to increase proportionately to the density of traffic and the occasional\
  \ blasts of the bus\u2019s horn.  As the bus approached the centre of the city,\
  \ the streets narrow and traffic slows. Turning down a long narrow street the bus\
  \ meets a car coming the wrong way up this one-way street. Instantly the two drivers\
  \ eyes meet and both simultaneously hit their horns, which signals to the other\
  \ drivers behind the bus to join in the cacophony of horns. \n\nThe other driver,\
  \ in his impossibly small Fiat, soon realizes that he has met his match and begins\
  \ to back-up. Our bus begins to move. The other drivers stop tooting their horns\
  \ and move along. Finally, we arrive at Milano\u2019s  Stazione Centrale.\n\nEntering\
  \ the station I find the Departures board, Venice as a destination is not to be\
  \ seen; but Venezia is. I proceed to the ticket counter and request a ticket to\
  \ Venice, \u201CVenezia\u201D the ticket agent replies. \u201CYes \u2026.Si \u2026\
  \ Oui\u201D I stutter. \u201CPrimo o Secondo classe\u201D, he asks. \u201CPrimo\u201D\
  , I reply, \u201CGrazie\u201D. After a few more moments, money is exchanged and\
  \ I have my ticket for a train that is departing in 7 minutes.\n\nI scramble out\
  \ of the station and on to the platform area.  There, the terminus of tracks are\
  \ far as the eye can see. Sweating and now approaching the point of panic, I again\
  \ review the huge departures board. I soon find Venezia and note that the train\
  \ will depart in 3 minutes from Track 9.\n\nRushing down the terminal towards Track\
  \ 9, I see two trains separated by a narrow walkway. I struggle among the crowds\
  \ and the steep steps to board the train. Panting I get on the train and move along\
  \ the corridor between the cabins. The train is packed, not a seat to be found.\
  \ I question beseechingly the first person, I see. \u201CVenice\u201D, I say with\
  \ the tone of desperation in my voice. \u201CNon\u201D he replies \u201CVicenza\u201D\
  . And then he points to the other train across the walkway, which is just starting\
  \ to move. \u201CVenezia\u201D he states calmly.\n\nGrabbing my luggage, I push\
  \ and shove my way off the train, dash across the walkway; jump on to the other\
  \ train, seconds before the conductor closes the door. Sweating now profusely, I\
  \ shout at him over the noise of the moving train, \u201CVenezia\u201D.\n\u201C\
  Si Venezia\u201D he replies.\n\n\nIn three hours I arrived in Venice.  Walking out\
  \ of the station, down a large expanse of stairs and on to the piazza that borders\
  \ the canal, I was approached by a helpful fellow who offered to find me a good\
  \ hotel. When I told him I already had a reservation at the Bauer Grunwald, he told\
  \ me he had never heard of it. But that is another story.\n\n\nCharles Steven Trenholme\n\
