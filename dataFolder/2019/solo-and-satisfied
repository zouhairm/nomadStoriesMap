Text: "The heavy black exhaust assaulted my nostrils as the double-decker bus pulled\
  \ to the curb. I scanned the queue behind me as the line stepped forward, and noticed\
  \ that I was the only solo traveller-I was ok with this. I\u2019d become comfortable\
  \ with the freedom that came adventuring alone provided. New York City however,\
  \ was the furthest from home I\u2019d ever gone on my own, which filled me with\
  \ a kind of tentative excitement. Pulling my ticket from the back pocket of my well-worn\
  \ jeans, I boarded the one o\u2019clock bus into the unknown. \n\n    I settled\
  \ into the soft blue seat and adjusted my ear-buds, when a muffled male voice broke\
  \ through the music, \u201CWhere ya headed?\u201D I pulled the ear-bud from my ear,\
  \ turning my head toward the sound, and was met with the wide smile of a small-statured,\
  \ dark-skinned man beside me, eagerly awaiting my reply. The next two hours were\
  \ filled with storytelling, laughter, and countless rounds of drippy tic-tac-toe\
  \ in the window\u2019s condensation. At some point I agreed to let Charlie be my\
  \ guide for my first NYC subway ride, figuring he\u2019d earned my trust.\n \n \
  \   When he told me we\u2019d reached my stop, I gave him a hug as payment, and\
  \ stepped off the train into the hustle of Manhattan. All the plants in the park\
  \ were dormant under the graying sky, but the park itself was alive with laughter\
  \ and frivolity. I wandered down the winding pathways, taking in all the beauty\
  \ of the architecture and fountains, finally arriving at the bustling skating rink.\
  \ With no time to wait in line, I continued on my journey.\n\n    A couple hours\
  \ later, the sun was quickly sinking behind the concrete and glass buildings towering\
  \ above me, and I realized I\u2019d accidentally found the loud, brightly-lit, and\
  \ very busy, Rockefeller Center. Pulling my hood up against the biting wind, I\u2019\
  d continued walking. While the shimmering of Christmas lights draped over every\
  \ surface alongside carols echoing down the street still captured my imagination,\
  \ this place wasn\u2019t for me. I was unsure of my destination, but excited by\
  \ the adventure that lay in the unknown. \n    \n    My wandering landed me at Bryant\
  \ Park. The flickering lights inside its walls beckoned me. I wandered in and out\
  \ of little tents, gawking at expensive trinkets, only able to afford a hot tea\
  \ with a cinnamon stick. I proceeded to the rink to watch the skaters dance, savoring\
  \ the moment. The sun had completely set and I was running short on time, but there\
  \ was one more place I needed to see- Grand Central station. \n   \n   The warm\
  \ yellow glow of the Station stood out against the cool fluorescent lights of the\
  \ city, welcoming me inside. I traversed the near-empty tunnels toward the main\
  \ foyer where my imagination traveled through time. Suddenly the station was busy\
  \ with visions of men and women dressed-to-the-nines milling about, racing to their\
  \ trains. Hunger pangs and the realization I\u2019d barely eaten all day brought\
  \ me back to reality and I\u2019d remembered Charlie advising me to check out the\
  \ Village; this meant my first solo NYC subway ride.\n     \n    I had done it!\
  \ I successfully navigated the Subway by myself! However, I had taken myself to\
  \ the wrong village. Everything was closed except the Chinese restaurants, so this\
  \ is where I took a table for one. I smiled to myself as I sat in quiet contemplation\
  \ of the day, filling my stomach with rich, heavy food. One last glance at the time\
  \ and I realized I\u2019d needed to go. I stepped out into the freezing winter night\
  \ and began the long trek to the bus station.\n     \n   I started this journey\
  \ filled with trepidation and ended it with a satisfied smile. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ what to expect as a young woman tackling the big bad city alone, but as I boarded\
  \ the bus, making my way to the best seat in the house, I was filled with pure joy.\
  \ I may not have been able to ice skate in Central Park, but I in fact experienced\
  \ so much more. I laid my head down against the cool window, closed my eyes, and\
  \ wished I\u2019d had a stranger to play tic-tac-toe with."
