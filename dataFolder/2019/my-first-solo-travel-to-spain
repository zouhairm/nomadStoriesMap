Text: "A friend of mine once called me Juanito on the soccer field and the name grew\
  \ on me; I suppose this was the Spanish version of Jovi. \nEvery now and again,\
  \ I would use a random Spanish word, and most of the time it was either grammatically\
  \ incorrect or simply an imaginary word that sounded Spanish. Back in University,\
  \ it was mandatory to take 4 second language courses, and Spanish was my number\
  \ one choice. Beginner 101 and 102 were a breeze; all I had to do was recall some\
  \ of the things I learned in High School Spanish. Intermediate 101 and 102 were\
  \ a bit challenging due to the oral presentations and group projects, however, I\
  \ managed to get through each semester with above average grades, surprisingly.\n\
  \ \n After graduation, my mind was set on traveling to a Spanish speaking country,\
  \ any country as long as they spoke Spanish. I researched for about 6 months creating\
  \ folders of websites and online travel work/study programs. None of the programs\
  \ I found was affordable for me--not even the volunteer programs were affordable.\
  \ I was ready to give up the search and simply find a job in my home state, NYC,\
  \ then I found AuPair. Aupair is a company that allows individuals to network with\
  \ families in other countries and, basically, assist a local family with house chores,\
  \ teach English, help with childcare and more. In exchange, the family will cover\
  \ transportation, lodging, meals, and a stipend each week. I was fortunate to find\
  \ a family who already had hired help to do all the chores. This left teaching English\
  \ and practicing with the family.\n \nThis entire plan was unpredictable and exciting\
  \ since I had never traveled to a non-English speaking country, much less by myself.\
  \  My next step was to secure my visa which took a few weeks to research, but the\
  \ process was surprisingly easier than I thought. I finally decided that Spain would\
  \ be my destination; so I registered for a semester at UCO University which was\
  \ in close proximity to the family I found on AuPair. \n \nAfter slowly putting\
  \ the pieces together for my great adventure to Spain, I contacted some friends\
  \ who were already teaching and studying in Madrid which is the capital of Spain.\
  \ They were able to give me some travel tips and also agreed to meet up when I arrived.\
  \ Time was a big factor at this point since my registration for class was in the\
  \ morning, and my flight was also that morning. Getting used to the timezone change\
  \ was challenge number one; I felt as if I did not sleep for the entire day. My\
  \ new school and the family I would be staying with were both in Andelucia, which\
  \ was a long train ride away.  Unfortunately, when I arrived, the train station\
  \ was closed. Unknown to me the train is not 24 hour service as in the US. It was\
  \ a good thing I had friends in Madrid who let me stay with them until the station\
  \ opened in the morning. \n \nI was on my own with no real-world experience as it\
  \ relates to speaking Spanish, only a small map. All of the water fountains look\
  \ similar as well as the roads, and I didn't quite understand the bus system. I\
  \ walked until I got lost and a stranger drove me to the nearest mall.There I felt\
  \ at ease knowing that there would be a phone somewhere, or better yet, wifi. I\
  \ was able to find a phone and call the family to pick me up. With 20 minutes to\
  \ spare, they were able to drive me to my first Spanish class, just in time for\
  \ registration. This ordeal was the most exciting, nerve-racking experience I had\
  \ ever encountered. I left home at midnight, got to Spain early morning, then arrived\
  \ to my class that same morning (which all felt like one whole day).\n \nOutside\
  \ of learning and becoming more comfortable with speaking and comprehending Spanish,\
  \ I definitely grew an appreciation and love for travel in general, and particularly\
  \ Spain. I would definitely recommend studying and experiencing Spain's Social-Lifestyle\
  \ and Culture, their History, the amazing Architecture, the Food, and the Music."
