Text: "Another day melts into night, painting the sky a glorious auburn hue, as I\
  \ conclude my hike through the rippling sand dunes and towering canyons of Wadi\
  \ Rum, a protected valley in southern Jordan.  Tucked in the depths of this mountainous\
  \ desert, amidst red sandstone hills, lies my rustic camp. I\u2019m here to experience\
  \ the nomadic life of Bedouins, indigenous Arabic desert dwellers.\n \nWhile I\u2019\
  m settling in my modest goat-hair tent, the whole site gets engulfed in piercing\
  \ darkness. The calm becomes disconcerting in this realisation. As the sole guest\
  \ here tonight, my only source of comfort is a distant flicker outside. I walk towards\
  \ this light hesitantly, unsure of what awaits.\n\nMy steps lead me to a raging\
  \ bonfire, encircled by a cosy collection of rugs, cushions and blankets. Perched\
  \ near the flame is Faris, the camp's caretaker, dressed in a long black robe mirroring\
  \ the night. He meets me with a sombre expression as he continues to smoke his shisha,\
  \ a pot of tea brewing by his side. My new companion seems aloof. Maybe, he\u2019\
  s awkward around a woman travelling alone through this Middle-Eastern desert. These\
  \ notions plague my mind as we sit in undisrupted silence. It\u2019s my first trip\
  \ to the region, and I\u2019m apprehensive of being inadvertently disrespectful.\
  \ His indifference fuels my reluctance to converse.\n\nAfter an indefinitely long\
  \ and uncomfortable pause, Salem, my hiking guide emerges from a nondescript tent.\
  \ Pans and plates in hand, \"Is the Zarb ready?\", he asks. As if on cue, Faris\
  \ springs to action, uncovering sand off from a small blanket spread in a corner.\
  \ I knew Zarb is the Bedouin barbeque; however, it\u2019s fascinating to watch my\
  \ dinner emerge from beneath the earth, placed in a three-tiered grill. \"It\u2019\
  s cooked over coal for three hours. The blanket seals the heat.\"; explains Faris,\
  \ sensing my curiosity. \"I marinated the lamb in a special blend of spices before\
  \ roasting it with vegetables. It\u2019s a secret family recipe I inherited from\
  \ my father.\" I notice his eyes light up while describing our appetising meal.\
  \ \u201CYou must try the Hummus and salad\u201D, he offers. Famished from my exhilarating\
  \ day, I fill my plate up. Succulent mouthfuls of meat soothe my inhibitions and\
  \ my hunger. \n\nShortly after dinner, Salem retreats to his tent, leaving Faris\
  \ and me by the crackling fire. While Faris resumes his shisha, I contemplate leaving\
  \ him to his privacy. \"You want Bedouin tea?\", he asks, contradicting my presumptions.\
  \ \"Perfect for cold nights\" he pours me a cup. \"I'm sure so is the shisha\",\
  \ I reply. With a smile, he passes me the pipe.\n\n\u201CI started working here\
  \ twelve years back. I was only 17 and didn\u2019t even speak English. Slowly, I\
  \ learnt. My family moved to the village nearby. But I chose the desert\u201D, Faris\
  \ reminisces, gazing at a shooting star dart through the moonless sky. \u201CWhy?\u201D\
  \ I wonder aloud. \u201CWell! The desert is my home. Besides, I meet many travellers\
  \ here. Some are reserved, so I don't talk much. But when someone is friendly, I\
  \ share shisha.\" he beams. I understand then that Faris wasn't cold or disapproving\
  \ of me earlier, but ensuring I don\u2019t feel intruded upon. It was I, instead,\
  \ who had given power to my prejudices.\n\nWe spend the following hours chatting\
  \ about our homes and families. I discover Faris's love for Bollywood when he plays\
  \ his favourite Indian tunes, songs I grew up on. He learns of my love for hummus\
  \ and my inability to balance flavours perfectly when cooking it. He promises to\
  \ teach me his secret recipe. We talk about lofty city skyscrapers and gigantic\
  \ desert canyons.\n\nI realise it's the simple things in life that unite us in our\
  \ shared humanity. How thousands of miles apart, we both enjoy the same things.\
  \ I recognise what keeps us divided isn't our differences, but our own impressions\
  \ of them. I came here to learn about Bedouin life but take back a far more important\
  \ lesson. Between endless cups of tea and the now dwindling flame, Faris teaches\
  \ me how to be a little more human. The Sun peeks over the horizon, the sky a glorious\
  \ auburn hue. It\u2019s already time for me to leave."
