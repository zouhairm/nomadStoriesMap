Text: "A dense unknown forest in Gokarna, an enchanting beauty of South India, me\
  \ and my friend decided to get lost in it. It was just 5 kms from Gokarna bus depot\
  \ to the famous Ohm beach, but we decided to take a detour via forest to reach the\
  \ beach. It took us around 7 hours to cover 5 kms, but wasn't tired a bit. Thanks\
  \ to our exploring mind, we could feel the vibes of the nature that made us healthier\
  \ than before. With no network, no data aid, no Google map, we still made it to\
  \ the beach. We had a better conversation with the nature, but there were no road\
  \ or passage inside the forest that we had to make a new passage for us. We could\
  \ find some wild byson, but thanks to the Almighty, we weren't harmed. \nIt was\
  \ one of the best nature exploring I had in my entire life. Our life isn't a book\
  \ just to fill and complete, it should be a feeling that we live and enjoy each\
  \ and every moment rather living with a bunch of assignments.\nThe only problem\
  \ with our trip was that we hadn't carry sufficient food and water, but it wasn't\
  \ that a problem when we reached inside it. In fact it would be our least concern\
  \ about the food. We were physically and mentally attached to the forest and there\
  \ created a special bond between us and the forest. A tiny drop of sun rays was\
  \ not there as it was covered with thick and huge trees.\nWe felt the extreme happiness\
  \ and pleasure when we found a door of sun rays. It was the door to the heaven as\
  \ we made a contact with the sun after hours of expedition through the forest."
