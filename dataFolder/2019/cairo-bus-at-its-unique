Text: "Getting on a city bus in Cairo can be as annoying as taking a city bus on the\
  \ streets of Jakarta. Old buses are still very much operating with uncomfortable\
  \ condition. The bad traffic in Cairo street made the bus seems more uncomfortable.\
  \ \nI live in Hay Ashir, one of the sub-districts in the outskirts of Cairo, only\
  \ has the option of taking a city bus or tramco (van) to travel to the office or\
  \ other places. \nI only need to take one connection bus without transit by paying\
  \ 2 pounds with an hour travel time. Actually Cairo has a subway as another public\
  \ transportation option that is quite feasible, timely and anti-traffic jam. However,\
  \ the closest station is quite far from where I live. Using a bus or tramco are\
  \ the two best choices. \nIn this city the bus can stop anywhere to step down or\
  \ up the passengers. That scenery is quite the same as what happened in big cities\
  \ in Indonesia.\nCairo streets also have a lot of drama. Fellow bus drivers often\
  \ have arguments on the streets and they yelling clearly to one of them. Most of\
  \ what they were fighting about was just a few trivial things, starting from the\
  \ wrestling to take the passengers, honking at each other busses who were thrashing,\
  \ or almost grazing each other on the road. For the last point, it often happens\
  \ because the drivers drive the bus incessantly, and it's not only just bus drivers\
  \ drive like that, seems every people who drive their own private cars are just\
  \ as crazy as bus driver. One of my friends often proudly tells the insanity of\
  \ Cairo people in driving. He says if we survive on the streets in Cairo, we will\
  \ survive on any street in the world.\n\nDuring my first two-month of living in\
  \ Cairo, I also try to familiarized myself with the streets of Cairo using a bus.\
  \ Not all buses and trams in Cairo are clearly written where to go. But amazingly,\
  \ we can know the direction of bus direction only from the symbols formed by hand.\
  \ To find out whether the bus is going to Ramsis, the center of Cairo, we can simply\
  \ move our hands with five fingers open, such as a movement when say goodbye, or\
  \ also usually a bus driver also move a similar hand to tell them they are heading\
  \ for Ramsis. To know which bus goes to District 7, we simply move the hand formed\
  \ the symbol \"peace\". The symbol of \"peace\" is interpreted as number 7 because\
  \ it is similar to writing number 7 in Arabic.\n\nThere are interesting things that\
  \ are quite unique and I think only happens on buses here in Cairo. That was the\
  \ pattern of passing money when paying costs. If the bus driver brings an assistant,\
  \ then the assistant will collect the money for ticket in the middle of the trip.\
  \ However, if the driver works alone without the assistant, the passengers whose\
  \ sitting in the back do not need to delivering the fare directly to the driver\
  \ in front. Once on the bus when I was heading to the office, suddenly there were\
  \ an old man sitting in the back patting me on the shoulder while giving a 10-pound\
  \ note. Well, I'm surprised that because he was given his money to foreigner like\
  \ me with no reason. Then with a confused face I ignored and afterwards my shoulder\
  \ was tapped again, I was still indifferent to confusion. The old man grunted while\
  \ giving the money to the person next to me. The money was passed to the driver,\
  \ then the driver passed a change of 8 pounds to the old man's hand behind. We don't\
  \ even need to move! Wow! And it's amazing because people here is trusting other\
  \ poeple to deliver the fare to the driver.\n\nThe next day I sat in the back and\
  \ tried the \"feature\" of cool bus here. I gave a 50 pound note for the fare, then\
  \ shifted it up to the front, the driver grumbled because he received a big number\
  \ of money, but my change was still in my hands without the slightest bit. Cool."
