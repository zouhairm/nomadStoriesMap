Text: "I live in Veternigo, a small village northwest of Venice. My six-month travel\
  \ adventure began in August 2017 in Maplewood, N.J., a small town west of New York\
  \ City. I was 18 and my first big trip was arranged by my godfather Marco not as\
  \ a vacation but as a life lesson. When Marco was my age, he went to America and\
  \ said his travels opened his mind to the world, and he wanted that to happen for\
  \ me. And it did.\n\nMarco arranged for me to live with an elderly couple in Virginia\
  \ (teaching her Italian and driving him to doctors\u2019 appointments) but my first\
  \ stop was in Maplewood. I was warmly greeted at Newark Airport by Marco\u2019s\
  \ long-time friends Richard and Kate, a married couple who I would soon learn also\
  \ loved to travel. Kate has kind brown eyes and a smooth, straight nose that reveal\
  \ her Greek roots. Richard is a large, quiet man with bright, white hair and a serious\
  \ face. He doesn\u2019t speak much, but when he does, often in Italian, he makes\
  \ me laugh.  When I curled my 5 foot 8 inch body into the back of their dirty 2000\
  \ Mercury Cougar I realized that they\u2019re the kind of people I want to be: the\
  \ type that don\u2019t flaunt their wealth; they use their money to travel to unexpected\
  \ places.\n\nMaplewood looks like a version of The Simpsons\u2019 Springfield. \
  \ The clapboard houses look very fragile to me in comparison to the stone houses\
  \ of the Veneto. I remember thinking I\u2019d be afraid to sleep in them during\
  \ a hard storm. Richard and Kate\u2019s house was more than a 100 years old and\
  \ every floorboard squeaked.\n\nThe next morning Kate and I walked to the village\
  \ center to try what Kate said was a typical New York breakfast. She made me practice\
  \ how to say \u201Cbagel with a schmear.\u201D  When the grumpy older man behind\
  \ the counter realized I was Italian he smiled, and politely took my order. He showed\
  \ us to a table and waited on us. When we got outside, Kate laughed, saying \u201C\
  This man is so rude to everyone.  I\u2019ve never seen him bring food to the table.\
  \ Your smile and long legs made his day. He was blushing as if he was remembering\
  \ a girl from his past.\u201D I don\u2019t know about that; but I enjoyed the bagel\
  \ and cream cheese.\n\nOn my second day in America, Kate and I took New Jersey Transit\
  \ to Penn Station. When I stepped into the crowded station full of people from all\
  \ walks of life, I fully realized how far away I was from my family and how different\
  \ New York City would be from anything I had seen before. \n\nSince I am applying\
  \ for a travel writing scholarship, I will spare the judges the details of my typical\
  \ tourist itinerary in the Big Apple. Suffice it to say, we hit the most famous\
  \ spots from Central Park to Ground Zero. The one unexpected place Kate took me\
  \ to was a giant ballroom filled with tables for 12 where Chinese using chopsticks\
  \ were busy talking and eating dumplings. The dim sum parlor made me realize there\
  \ was a whole world to explore, foods to eat, people to talk to and unusual places\
  \ to see. Besides being a native Italian speaker, I majored in English, Spanish\
  \ and French.  I work hard and push myself to learn every day. \nAs an Italian,\
  \ I grew up in a culture where empathy for people is part of our soul. My empathy\
  \ I think will make me a good travel writer someday."
