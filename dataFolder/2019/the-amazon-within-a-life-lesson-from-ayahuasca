Text: "People say that ayahuasca is a truth serum, but I think it's a fear venom.\
  \ It drives its viny tendrils deep into the sludge of your soul. It has an arsenal\
  \ of machinery ready to excavate the worst beliefs you hold about yourself. It can\
  \ make you live your worst nightmares, often in the most creative of ways. And if\
  \ you're lucky, it may even kill you. \n\nIt was my fifth time working with ayahuasca\
  \ on a 23-day immersion somewhere in the emerald belly of the Peruvian Amazon, and\
  \ I was getting pretty used to the drill: \n\n5:45pm - Prep\n\nGrab ceremony essentials:\
  \ headlamp, crystals, blanket, water bottle, pillow, lighter. \n\n5.55pm - Set-up\n\
  \nHead to the large jungle hut called the Maloca. Remember the protocols:\n\nLie\
  \ water bottle flat to prevent knocking it over and scaring everyone mid-ceremony\n\
  \nPractice putting headlamp on the red-light setting to not blind everyone mid-ceremony.\n\
  \nCarefully position plastic vomit bucket\n\n\n6:00 - Yoga\n\nI try to keep a clear\
  \ mind in class but my brain insists on thinking about pesto pasta, Thai beaches,\
  \ and my long history of questionable life choices.\n\nThe Shipibo healers arrive:\
  \ A husband and wife team with plant medicine in their bones. Maestro Americo whistles\
  \ a song into an old soft drink bottle filled with ayahuasca. They pour me a shot\
  \ glass full of the brown sludge, I down the medicine and gracefully holdback an\
  \ insta-purge. \n\nThe lanterns are taken away, and we are left in the dark limbo\
  \ lands. \n\nWaiting.\n\nWaiting.\n\nNothing is happen-Whooooooooomph\n\nMy mind\
  \ was strapped to SpaceX and launched to a land where enthusiastic elves competed\
  \ to show me their geometric mega-devices, yet my body remained in the madhouse\
  \ of a maloca. Whimpers echoed from the bathroom, red lights flashed like police\
  \ sirens, and every ten seconds a very loud thud booms through the space.\n\nReality\
  \ dissolved into a webbed sea of menacing energy. My eyes itch and puff up, my throat\
  \ closes....smaller, smaller until it's difficult to breathe.\n\nI saw a movie screen\
  \ flashback of the ayahuasca assistant smirking while stirring a killer plant into\
  \ a pot of bubbling ayahuasca. A plant that would cause a very long, slow and painful\
  \ death. \n\nI'd been poisoned! It was his plan all along.\n \nI crawled towards\
  \ the door to escape, with the thought that I'd rather die within the quiet walls\
  \ of a lantern-lit bathroom than an asylum. \n\nMy eyes blink closed and a trillion\
  \ visions strobe: barbie pink butterflies dance in a kaleidoscopic pop-art painting\
  \ that fractals into infinity. My eyes blink open and the floor starts breathing\
  \ again.\n \nNewspaper headlines projected onto the bathroom walls \"12 Found Dead\
  \ in Amazon Poisoning\". I'd forever be known as the girl who died drinking ayahuasca\
  \ in the jungle.\n \nAfter teleporting back to the maloca, the medicine kept me\
  \ in its claws for hours. I was dragged, poked, X-rayed, dissected, and disinfected.\
  \ I told my family I loved them. I accepted my own death.\n \nThen, silence.\n \n\
  The shamans stopped singing.\n \nAllen\u2019s comforting voice lit up the room.\
  \ \n \n'Alright beautiful people, the ceremony is now closed, gracias para La Medicina'.\n\
  \ \nAnd in that moment I was back. I was a shattered shell, unable to move, but\
  \ holy moly, I was Alisha and praise the starry skies, I was alive!\n \nI lay sprawled\
  \ on my mattress, eyes wide open until the roosters called and early morning rays\
  \ shone through the mosquito-netted walls. \n \nAs I stumbled back to my hut, silent\
  \ tears rolled at seeing this world for the first time. I had to hold myself back\
  \ from shouting: OH MY GOD look how green the grass is! I was mesmerized by the\
  \ trail of ants, and even the cat was a mystical and magical being.\n \nAyahuasca\
  \ helps us to remember.\n \nRemember that we spend our lives trapped in a backwards\
  \ bitch of a society, so hell-bent on becoming that we miss the beauty of being.\
  \ The joy of a sweet smile, the rustling of leaves, a gap in thoughts, a deep inhale\
  \ and full exhale. Oh what a gift it is to simply breathe.\n \nAyahuasca helps us\
  \ to remember. \n \nThat one day we won't breathe anymore."
