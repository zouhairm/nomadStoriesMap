Text: "My trip to Colombia in the summer of 2018 began as a global volunteer. I was\
  \ afraid and a thousand emotions inside me, but on June 21 I decided to take the\
  \ flight, with everything and fear inside of me. \n My first destination was Monter\xED\
  a, a small town in the coastal area of Colombia, a very hot city, full of green,\
  \ mangoes and food that I had never tasted. There, I stayed with a local family,\
  \ which was a key part of my experience. They taught me the basic customs of the\
  \ city, where to go and where not, what to eat and what never. I had the opportunity\
  \ to volunteer at the local jail in the city, knowing even more the history behind\
  \ the Colombian walls. A week later I met Cartagena, a beautiful walled city, full\
  \ of colonial history, beautiful white beaches, streets full of history and color.\
  \ Walking through the avenues I was able to notice the taste of Colombian life,\
  \ the problems that local people experience, being part of one of the poorest cities\
  \ in the country.\nThen, I returned to Monter\xEDa for two weeks, I continued to\
  \ get to know the little city, getting lost in its streets, dancing in the most\
  \ fun discos, eating fritos and arepas every day, and taking the best juices of\
  \ passion fruit and mango of my life.\nThe next destination was Medell\xEDn, the\
  \ city of eternal spring. And the adventure started from getting on the bus with\
  \ my friends and going on a 10-hour trip on rocky and difficult roads. When we arrived,\
  \ we took an uber who turned out to be a singer and gave us his album, it was amazing.\
  \ We arrived at the tourist zone of the city, we looked for our hostel, we arranged\
  \ ourselves and we left to walk by the streets of the city. At night, I met two\
  \ French boys, one Argentine and another Mexican! We spend the night talking, dancing\
  \ and sharing intercultural understandings of our own contexts and realities.\n\
  The next day, we walked around 20 km through the city with our new friends, toured\
  \ the communes of Medell\xEDn, getting involved with the social context so difficult\
  \ that locals live.\nLater, we went to Guatap\xE9, a town near Medell\xEDn, full\
  \ of colors and beautiful buildings. There were many tourists like us, so the atmosphere\
  \ was quite pleasant. We decided to climb the Piedra del Pe\xF1ol, a rock with 600\
  \ stairs on one side, that when you climb it you can see the best view of the area.\n\
  Everything about Colombia I loved. I managed to feel part of the culture, to wrap\
  \ myself in its social context. Everything about Colombia I loved. I managed to\
  \ feel part of the culture, to wrap myself in its social context. I would totally\
  \ return to Colombia, and I will never forget this adventure, that made me self-aware,\
  \ solution oriented and mostly, a world citizen."
