Text: "Cape Town and Johannesburg often come off as the El Dorado of South Africa,\
  \ or so I thought until my last trip to Clarens in November 2018. On this trip,\
  \ I wanted something entirely different, and I was lucky to have a guide who knows\
  \ what \u201Centirely different\u201D means. \nUpon my arrival at OR Tambo, my tour\
  \ guide picked me up and we headed out of 'Jozi' to the laid-back, but charming,\
  \ countryside called Clarens. The journey was about the same distance to Sun city\
  \ (less than 3-hour drive) from Johannesburg.\nFree State, home province of Clarens,\
  \ enjoys clement weather, and has beautiful views of gentle greenery. Clarens itself\
  \ enjoys pleasant quiet in its location at the foothills of the Maluti Mountains.\n\
  No, there were no paparazzi there! You\u2019ll find nothing close to the glitz and\
  \ buzz of Johannesburg, nor the fame, fortune and crowd of Cape Town. Clarence is\
  \ like a blissfully drop off the planet to a place that perfectly defines \"off-the-beaten-track.\"\
  \nIf what you seek is a small town where you can let your hair down and have some\
  \ fun, Clarens it is. However, after lazing around for a while, you\u2019ll definitely\
  \ need somewhere to unwind, and this is not lacking in this small town. \nAs an\
  \ adventure junky, I just didn\u2019t want to sit in the hotel alone. About two\
  \ hours after arriving in Clarens, I called my guide and we set out to explore.\n\
  Here is what I did:\nOne of the prime places we visited is Clarens Xtreme. As the\
  \ name suggests, this place is for adventure junkies. Their offerings include zip\
  \ lining on some four lines that slide across a little valley, quad biking, an amazing\
  \ white water rafting on the Ash River\u2014one of the best rafting spots in South\
  \ Africa known for its exciting grade 3 and 4 water rapids all year, 4X4 trails\
  \ of the bush paths, abseiling, mountain hiking, among others.\nOn the Zipline,\
  \ sliding through with the ropes feels easy and nice until you get halfway and imagine\
  \ yourself falling off the hook. I did the four slides and felt like a hero afterwards.\
  \ \nNext, I headed for the Ash River for a two-hour water-rafting. My guide told\
  \ me the river was just a tiny stream until about 1998 when the Northern delivery\
  \ tunnel of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project was opened. With the opening, some\
  \ 18 cubic meters of water was released per second into the tiny stream gradually\
  \ turning it into a strong flowing river.\nI had never tried water rafting before.\
  \ The thought of capsizing never crossed my mind until I touched and felt how cold\
  \ the water was. \u201CDon\u2019t be scared my friend\u201D, one of the instructors\
  \ said while I was still weighing whether to wear the gear and join the cruise or\
  \ not. I summed up the courage and joined the water rafting; the fun was out of\
  \ this world! Yeah, we had a capsize at a point, it was all part of the experience.\
  \ \nI welcomed the next rising sun from the comfort of a hot-air balloon. It is\
  \ the most outstanding way to experience the majestic view of Clarence. From the\
  \ orange-coloured sky, Clarens\u2019 gorgeous landscape with a backdrop of the Maluti\
  \ Mountains comes to you in an awe-inspiring way. I guess it\u2019ll be wonderful\
  \ for honeymooners to try this anytime. \nLater that day, I visited the scenic Golden\
  \ Gate National Park, home to a beautiful landscape of grassland and amazing mountain\
  \ ranges as well as wildlife like Baboons. The national park is just about 30 minute-drive\
  \ from Clarens centre and hosts the Basotho cultural village. \nIf there is anything\
  \ one cannot dispute about this park, it is its picturesque quality, thanks to its\
  \ rolling hills and valley, verdant landscape and wonderful wildlife."
