Text: "Everything and nothing\n\nIt was my first time ever I traveled alone. The first\
  \ time I went to the airport alone. The first time I flew and landed alone. I already\
  \ experienced some Interrail journeys with my boyfriend but never travelled completely\
  \ alone into the unknown.\nWhen I saw the greek landscape in the morning for the\
  \ really first time my heart fluttered out of my chest and jumped itself into the\
  \ turquoise water. \nI was in Greece for 2 months and after less than a week my\
  \ body language, my thinking and my feeling of freedom had completely changed. I\xB4\
  ve always lived in the city. Cars, traffic, noise, chaos- normality for me. And\
  \ my idea of freedom was always like when you can do what you want to do, when you\u2019\
  re independent from your parents and everyone else then you\u2019re free.\n\nBut\
  \ Greece taught me that freedom means something bigger.\nWhen your eyes see infinite\
  \ landscapes, your mind can\u2019t think in cartons. \nWhen your heart  bounces\
  \ when it feels how your body overcomes a fear like jump off a cliff or submerge\
  \ oneself in the underwater world then your soul has to bounce too.\nSalty hair,\
  \ brown skin, the sun that burns on your body, the relaxed mentality from the greeks,\
  \ zaziki, feta cheese and olives all day long.\nI can\xB4t remember a time laughing\
  \ as much as I did in Greece. \nWhen I wrote my diary I wrote things like I want\
  \ to stay here forever and I\xB4m feeling free for the first time of my life.\n\
  And after a month I realized why I was so happy, why I felt so free and why I felt\
  \ more alive than ever before. \nAnd when I realized that I got scared. Scared,\
  \ because I knew that I would loose this feeling. \nIt is hard to keep the feeling\
  \ from vacation with you into everyday life. Mostly it\xB4s not possible.\nBut when\
  \ you realize that you\u2019re a different person, that you feel more alive and\
  \ that you feel much better in every respect- so maybe  you should take a look at\
  \ your everyday life.\nI realized that the sea gave me something that nothing and\
  \ nobody else can give me.\nSatisfaction, farsightedness, awareness of myself and\
  \ my strength. \nI also realized that it\xB4s not possible to take the sea with\
  \ me. Maybe it is possible maybe not, mybe I was too young or maybe I was already\
  \ too deep into my everyday city life- to be honest I don\u2019t know but I didn\u2019\
  t manage to bring the feeling of greek liveliness back to Germany. \n\nBut I remember.\
  \ I have memories about memories. Not just in my camera, most of all in my head\
  \ and in my heart. I can evoke those feelings and memories when I\xB4m sitting in\
  \ the train and my heart bounces like it did at my first day in Greece. I can close\
  \ my eyes and see those celestial beautiful sunsets. I can smell the dust-dry heat,\
  \ the olives trees and the garlic in the zaziki.\nI imagine that I have a cupboard\
  \ with glasswares and they have feelings, memories and moments from different trips,\
  \ different countries and different times in it. These are the little things which\
  \ make my heart bounce when I think of them.\nAnd I hope that my children, grandchildren\
  \ and great- grandchildren will have the opportunity to see all these beautiful\
  \ places all over the world. What we humans have to understand is, that no money\
  \ and material possession can make us happy and feel free. If we don\u2019t want\
  \ to take those feelings away from the future generations we all should remember\
  \ the feeling of our first trip alone into the unknown. And if they should experience\
  \ the same feeling we\xB4re not allowed to destroy the world like we are  doing\
  \ it right now. Everyone should have the chance to see how beautiful this planet\
  \ is, because it\xB4s the greatest gift we\xB4ll ever get. We should be grateful\
  \ for gifts. \nRemember your shelf full of jars with memories. Don\u2019t you think\
  \ everyone should have a jar like that?"
