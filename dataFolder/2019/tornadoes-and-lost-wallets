Text: "On a day much like today I decided to take voyage into the unknown. OKLAHOMA\
  \ was the designated destination. I boarded a bus which took me into the city. I\
  \ was to document the aftermath of Tornadoes in Moore Oklahoma. That was one reason\
  \ I went. Another was Andrew  McIntosh. He was to Document and address the issues\
  \ that had calmed into Catastrophy. His company was helping the communities rebuild\
  \ their homes.  A breath of life once again given from his heart.  The first was\
  \ saving my life. He performed CPR on my flatlined heart. I wanted to see him again\
  \ and thank him. First I had to get to moore. With no phone or gps I turned instead\
  \ into what I call my internal GPS. Trust thyself to carry forward.  I met a man\
  \ at a crossroad. He was in a truck and I asked for directions to Moore. He just\
  \ so happened to be on the same route. Without hesitation I entered the vehicle\
  \ and was on my way To Moore. \nI saw a 711 and bunch of people providing water\
  \ and food for those who had suffered loss. He turned into the neighborhood he lived\
  \ in. My eyes had never seen such calamity before.  In a way it was peaceful I saw\
  \ past the rubble and identified the art within. I began the capture of portraits\
  \ that Eyes should never have to witness. Yet I was captivated by the miracle of\
  \ renewed life. People were in shock but they knew exactly what to do. It seemed\
  \ that attempting to find belongings was only part of the challenge.  The way I\
  \ saw it everyone was happy. Sure they were frustrated but they weren't worried.\
  \  It came time for me to go home. The bus that I had boarded took off without me\
  \ during a break. So I thought to my self better move. I found myself On the side\
  \ of the highway hiking around decided to take videos and photographs. As I walked\
  \ I noticed a shape in the dirt. It was a wallet! It had the identification of a\
  \ university student. My critical thinking skills kicked in and I immediately began\
  \ searching for this persons address or phone number. Success! The whitepages provided\
  \ a number for her mother's house. I called her and she agreed to meet me at a gas\
  \ station. She was baffled; it had been three weeks since her daughter lost her\
  \ wallet. She asked if she could do something for me and I asked for a ride to the\
  \ nearest bus station.  When I arrived I noticed I was right back where I started.\
  \ I waited for the next bus and I told the chauffeur my situation.  I was granted\
  \ a seat. I learned that when traveling one must always keep hope and faith that\
  \ no harm shall come to me; so long as I travel with respect for others and myself.\
  \  I ended up having a brief moment with my friend. It was good to see him in a\
  \ role that was once my own. We are battle buddies who met in The ARMY. Our jobs\
  \ were to be always vigilant and provide clear communication.  This job is still\
  \ predominant in my art and Poetry. I have surmised that traveling is but the act\
  \ of Communication with the world our environment. The cold tells us to warm up\
  \ and the Heat of the day tells us to find ways to keep cool. The seasons tell us\
  \ that change is constant. The ability to Communicate and live in harmony with these\
  \ changes; is the trait of Adept Adaptation.  A traveler must always be ready to\
  \ step out of the comfort zone. This is the only way to experience that which should\
  \ make us grow. Thank you for existing. I hope to exist in Portugal. So that Andrew's\
  \ Breath of life be not in vain."
