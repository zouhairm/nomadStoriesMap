Text: "Something inside of me shifted. I watched the 14 year old boy\u2019s slight\
  \ frame command the attention of the room, barefoot with a casual t-shirt and still\
  \ wearing his grey school trousers, as he acted out the role of a grown man giving\
  \ into alcohol.\n\nThis is in Philippi, based in the Cape Flats just outside Cape\
  \ Town, South Africa. It is a mere 30 minute drive from my home. Yet, every time\
  \ I arrive it feels like a trip 25 years into the past. \n\nPhilippi once served\
  \ as a battleground during oppressive Apartheid as people of colour wanted rights\
  \ to housing development. Today there are still many development challenges in a\
  \ place of great potential. Somewhat resistant to the surrounding urban sprawl,\
  \ Philippi has remained interspersed with residential areas, townships and farmlands.\
  \ Townships are particularly low-income, informal areas where taps and toilets are\
  \ outside in the sandy shared spaces. Houses are often colourful crooked shacks\
  \ inventively made with corrugated iron and pieces of discarded wood or other found\
  \ material. \n\nCape Town on the other hand is a burgeoning city that is a magnet\
  \ for tourists, the wealthy, freelancers, nature lovers, hipsters, artists, and\
  \ lifestyle enthusiasts. The irony is that whether residents of Cape Town realise\
  \ it or not, almost half of the city\u2019s vegetables are grown in Philippi. It\
  \ serves as the spinal cord for food security but is often overlooked and struggling\
  \ with poverty.  \n\nThis particular trip really stands out in my memory. After\
  \ leaving my home in the coastal quaint Muizenberg, I journeyed through a space\
  \ in great contrast to my home area. Orange, white and grey wooden doors, bath tubs,\
  \ window panes, two-seater couches and plastic-covered mattresses paired with sagging\
  \ bed bases were neatly piled for sale on the side of the road. Brightly painted\
  \ ship containers converted into stores advertised fish & chips takeaways, tailors,\
  \ barbers, salons, welders, hardware stores and spaza shops. Hand-painted signs\
  \ adorned any patched up corners for car washes, airtime or pap (a traditional dense\
  \ porridge made from ground maize meal) with beef/chicken stew. Signs of a booming\
  \ informal economy. \n\nFurther along the road, closer to the youth-friendly centre\
  \ that was my destination, the smell in the air changed. From the often dusty smell\
  \ interspersed with laying garbage, wafted in the smokey smell of chicken, sheep\
  \ and beef on the braai (barbecue). The afternoon entrepreneurs were using the broad\
  \ busy sidewalk to attract hungry customers. Chatter encircled the half metal drums\
  \ as the cooks stood in the smoky channel turning meat. You could see it was only\
  \ the beginning of business due to the raw meat stacked high on the white plastic\
  \ tables next to them.\n\nI was there to take a short amateur video of some of the\
  \ students that attend the youth-friendly space. It\u2019s a safe space where students\
  \ can come after school to learn and take ownership of their sexual health. It\u2019\
  s also a creative space for expression, often in the form of drama. Within seconds\
  \ of arriving the students between the ages of 14 and 19 began rehearsing their\
  \ play. My fingers quickly fumbled to turn my camera from off mode to recording\
  \ before my ISO had even been correctly set. \n\nWhat evolved through the drama\
  \ shook me to my core as I watched young school students act out the potential challenges\
  \ that they can face on a daily basis. Boys pretended to succumb to pressures of\
  \ gangsterism; girls pretended to get raped and fall pregnant; students acted out\
  \ difficulties of facing stigma from health workers and community members; and then\
  \ they interlaced the struggle of dealing with all of these pressures with hope\
  \ when so many resort to drugs or alcohol. \n\nMy first reaction was that these\
  \ students were too young to be talking, let alone acting, these dramas. They proved\
  \ me wrong. I was soon humbled as the play made me laugh, want to cry, feel shame,\
  \ and then lose all sense of hope only to find it again in the end. What I witnessed\
  \ was the resilience of the human spirit and a glance into a world that is so close\
  \ geographically and yet so far in reality."
