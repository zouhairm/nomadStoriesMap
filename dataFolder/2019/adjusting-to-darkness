Text: "Shuffling forwards or so I think I am towards what I hope is the way out but\
  \ I cannot be sure, I really cannot be sure of anything. My eyes cannot adjust so\
  \ they may as well be closed but in the hope that I see a glimmer of light I keep\
  \ them open. \n\nMy hands tingle in the cold as I use them to feel my way out. It\
  \ makes it harder to tell where I am because everything feels the same but there\
  \ are times were my hands run over smooth patches of rock followed by a roughly\
  \ cut section of wall, which might have eroded away hence why the ground feels so\
  \ uneven.\n\nMy feet are worse off than my hands. My shoes have gone past soaking\
  \ point as I continue the shuffle. The water has found a way through my shoes and\
  \ it\u2019s very chilling. I would have guessed the water be 10 degrees Celsius.\
  \ Knowing that the water has to enter somewhere the exit must not be too far away\
  \ but still I cannot tell. \n\nStep by step, trudging through ankle deep water,\
  \ I tripped, scrapping my hand against a surface which I cannot see.\nMy hearing\
  \ picks up everything from the faintest of noises entering from where I had just\
  \ come to droplets of water that would fall at different rates and varying distances\
  \ giving me a picture of where I was and where I had to go. \nJust keep following\
  \ the droplets.\n\nEvery moment I spend immersed in the unknown, my mind begins\
  \ to stitch together where I am. My hands feel walls, solid in nature with patches\
  \ of smooth and rough rock often causing with water. Below me, my feet spend most\
  \ of the time dipping in and out of glacial water causing my pinkie toes to go numb.\
  \ \n\nAs for my hearing, it\u2019s as if I can hear everything that is happening\
  \ around me from droplets of water plummeting into the water below causing a dancing\
  \ of beautiful echoes.\n \nI stop. \n\nMy senses have never been so active and have\
  \ never been so important till this moment. As I stand to take a deep breath of\
  \ air which I am not sure how clean is, a green dot, single in nature beams from\
  \ the ceiling. All of a sudden my eyes draw to this speck which appears to multiply\
  \ and triple until the ceiling sparkles with over a thousand dots.\n  \nAs my eyes\
  \ had fully adjusted, I found it extraordinarily difficult in telling the difference\
  \ between the night sky mimicking the Milky Way and the flickering of glowworms\
  \ I notice a stray butterfly had found it\u2019s self the victim of one of the glowworms.\n\
  The bio-luminescent of the glowworms faded, my drenched, numb feet constantly on\
  \ the shuffle reflected the feeling of my hands. One last trickle of icy snow melt\
  \ made its way through a crack, finding its way down my spine, a glimmer appeared\
  \ just off to my centre of field, golden in nature.\n  \nNatural light began to\
  \ bounce off my body onto the ominous but silky black rock, giving me an obscured\
  \ vision of what I had just travelled through. With a few last steps, my hands could\
  \ be seen for the first time still dripping with snow melt and drops of blood infused.\n\
  \ \nFronds of the native Punga glistened with swirling mist and swayed gently as\
  \ a breathe of wind weaved through the dense canopy while streams of water effortlessly\
  \ passed through layers of permeable rock lined with dark, green lichens. A shimmer\
  \ of light reflects onto the recently melted water, filtered by an array of draping\
  \ mosses lining the caves entrance.\n \nWith spots of sun against my back, a breeze\
  \ whisks out of the cave pressing against my chest pushing, gently moving individual\
  \ leaves of the Punga.\n \nOnce again I entered the cave to a place not as dark\
  \ as I once thought.\n\nMy eyes gazed upon the plethora of glowworms, immediately\
  \ I noticed that the butterfly had vanished. I wondered if this butterfly could\
  \ be me, not knowing if I would make it out to see light we humans so dearly desire."
