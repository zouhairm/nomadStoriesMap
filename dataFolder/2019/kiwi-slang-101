Text: "Every time we visit a new country, it is a must to know the basic language\
  \ they use so we can communicate better when we are actually in that country. I\
  \ am a Filipino citizen who loves traveling across Europe and Asia and came across\
  \ a couple of countries where they speak different languages and English but in\
  \ a different context. When I traveled to England or the United Kingdom including\
  \ Scotland in 2014, the challenges I had was understanding how the London Underground\
  \ Tube works and of course the Scottish accent as they tend to say words in different\
  \ pronunciations like saying \u201Cbutter\u201D but they rather say it \u201Cbutteh\u201D\
  \ or a \u201Cgirl\u201D to \u201Cgal\u201D with a silent \u201CR\u201D or instead\
  \ of saying \u201Cit\u2019s NOT a problem, Scottish would rather say \u201Cit\u2019\
  s NO a problem\u201D. \nAnother interesting English which I have encountered was\
  \ with Aussies or Australian when I was working back in Dubai, one of the challenges\
  \ I had was the number of words they pronounce in a second, means they speak fast\
  \ but also have their own set of Aussie slang such as instead of saying \u201CChristmas\u201D\
  , Aussie would say \u201CChrissie\u201D or \u201CFootball\u201D to \u201CFooty\u201D\
  . Or they say \u201CHe\u2019s a crook\u201D means \u201CHe\u2019s a criminal\u201D\
  \ or \u201CWe\u2019re having a Barbie\u201D means \u201CWe\u2019re having a Barbecue\u201D\
  . \n\nBeing a Filipino, we grew up learning American English because of the colonization\
  \ in the past so we speak and write based on American English. The only trouble\
  \ we have is sometimes even if we know we are speaking in English, upon coming to\
  \ New Zealand eight (8) months ago, that made me realized that my English isn\u2019\
  t exactly the way I understood it. Funny as it sounds but yes, you read that right\
  \ and below is a chart of some of the words I have gathered up to date. I will be\
  \ highlighting the examples and instances I have encountered throughout my stay\
  \ in the Kiwi Land.\nMost of the Kiwis do speak fast especially the men, literally\
  \ some are speaking continuously with no space for breathing, no period or full\
  \ stop (at least with the people I have met along the way); the conversation jumps\
  \ from one topic to another without any warnings and for me, that is quite interesting.\
  \ I remember one of my partner\u2019s friend who is a Kiwi himself, was wondering\
  \ why Filipinos whom he was interviewing for his company (over Skype) does not understand\
  \ him at all and I explained to him that our ears are not used to hear multiple\
  \ words in a second, therefore, in order for him to be understood, he has to speak\
  \ slower than his usual tone. Certainly they have their own set of words or in this\
  \ case, I prefer to call it as a \u201CKiwi Slang\u201D that you would not be able\
  \ to understand if you are a newbie in their community. Mind you, they do not realize\
  \ it until you tell them or you ask them twice of what they just have said. Hence,\
  \ the main purpose of this article is to create awareness and also help the other\
  \ newcomers or tourists to understand the Kiwis and be more at home in this land.\
  \ I also would like to excuse myself, if in any way offending the Kiwis with my\
  \ explanation or observations I have had since staying in the country.\n\n\u2022\
  G\u2019d Day/ Kia Ora - Hello/Good Day - Kiwi Greetings\n\u2022Sweet as - Everything\
  \ is fine/it\u2019s all good!  -  Kiwis often use it like \u201CSweet as mate!\u201D\
  \n\u2022Cheers - Thanks/Thank you - Saying \u201Cthank you\u201D to the one they\u2019\
  re taking to when ending their convo\n\u2022Good as gold - Great/Got it/Noted! -\
  \ Same as above, how Kiwi ends their conversation\n\nAnd the Kiwi way of washing\
  \ the dishes, they fill the sink with hot water, put the dishwashing liquid on till\
  \ the bubbles pops out, soaking the dishes into the bubbly sink, removing the dishes\
  \ and drying it with a tea towel and placing it back to the cupboard. We normally\
  \ rinse dishes in piles first, soap them to remove the dirt and grease, then you\
  \ wash them and dry them out before putting it back to cupboards."
