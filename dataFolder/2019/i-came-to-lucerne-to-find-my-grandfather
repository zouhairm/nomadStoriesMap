Text: "My journey to Lucerne didn\u2019t start when I arrived there, it did long before,\
  \ as a part of my family history.\nMy grandfather was a great wanderer. I used to\
  \ ask him which had been the best place he had been to. He would always answer,\
  \ with no doubts in his eyes: \n\u201CLucerne, in Switzerland.\u201D\n\u201CWhy?\u201D\
  \n\u201CCan you bring me a glass of water?\u201D\nAnd the conversation would never\
  \ have any progress. I could only explain his misterious habit of changing the topic\
  \ as an invitation to discover it by myself.\nHe passed away 6 months before I finally\
  \ had the chance to visit his chosen city. At the age of 21 I would experience my\
  \ first solo trip, which I didn\u2019t envisage as a way of finding myself, like\
  \ most solo travelers do, but as a way of finding him.\nI was on my way to Lucerne,\
  \ on a very comfortable bus, when my fervour started. I was sleeping, or trying\
  \ to, next to the window, but I woke up abruptly for no reason at all. In the moment\
  \ I opened my eyes I was shocked: immense and vast mountains covered in white from\
  \ the top to the bottom were standing before me, and it took just that second to\
  \ feel it was the most magnificent landscape I had ever seen.\n Not even in movies\
  \ had I seen something so flawlessly unreal, not even in dreams. And yet it was\
  \ real. The feeling of my heart racing as I contemplated the Alpes is something\
  \ I still feel whenever I recall it. And it was only the beginning of the adventure\
  \ to which my grandfather had led me.\nWhen I arrived, a sudden joy seized me: I\
  \ was there to search my grandfather and I knew sooner or later I would find him.\
  \ I was connecting with the city through my grandfather\u2019s memory, and at the\
  \ same time I was reconnecting with him through Lucerne. \nIt was 5 in the afternoon,\
  \ but it was already dark and the city lights were printing their reflection on\
  \ the lake. I decided to walk to my hostel even knowing it was a long way carrying\
  \ a heavy backpack. But it was a good chance to get to know a part of the city,\
  \ and it was one of the best nightwalks I\u2019ve ever had.\nI didn\u2019t take\
  \ the fastest route on the map, I wanted to wander around: I enjoyed watching people\
  \ going in and out of the shops at the main loud busy streets, and also took great\
  \ delight in listening to the quiet of the empty residential ones. \nHalfway, when\
  \ I was gazing at the Museggmauer (the towers and walls of the city, which were\
  \ already covered with snow just as the fields next to them) it started to snow.\
  \ It was the second time in my life (just a few weeks after the first one) I could\
  \ touch snow. Watching it fall while it danced so delicately on its way from the\
  \ sky amazed me and made me wonder how come it could be something so undescribably\
  \ pure and graceful. I knew I was fortunate. \nThe next day I sought my grandfather\
  \ in every landmark. \nI found his adventurous spirit while watching the most astonishing\
  \ mountain and city view from the Gutsch castle situated on a hill. \nI crossed\
  \ the Kapellbr\xFCcke (Chapel Bridge) and the other spectacular bridges over the\
  \ River Reuss feeling he was walking beside me with his elephant gait. \nI found\
  \ his love for Swiss knives, watches and chocolates on the colourful commercial\
  \ streets of the city centre. \nI met with the lion monument named L\xF6wendenkmal,\
  \ and recognised it from the photographs on my grandfather\u2019s living room. \n\
  I walked around Lucerne Lake (at the city centre), which offered urban grandeur,\
  \ and Rotsee Lake (near my hostel), which offered solitude and harmony with nature:\
  \ both things that my grandfather appreciated wisely at their right time.\nThe whole\
  \ city was full of him, and as I am writing this, I feel a knot of nostalgia in\
  \ my stomach and my heart. I wish I was back there in Lucerne, and I wish my grandfather\
  \ was back there with me."
