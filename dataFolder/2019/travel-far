Text: "6:00 am the driver waited bright and early to transport the 4 of us, an hour\
  \ and a half away from our Beijing Hotel. 700 Yuan for the ride and I don\u2019\
  t think it truly hit me where I was headed until I saw the faded snow covered road\
  \ sign directing us to Mutianyu Great Wall of China. 14\xB0 F with defective hand\
  \ warmers and no gloves; tired, cold and now wet, we finally arrived. Looking around\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but wonder where was it? I braced myself for the chill of\
  \ winter, trodded through snow piles to get my tickets and still hadn\u2019t seen\
  \ the iconic wall, not even in the distance. We followed the driver, Jian, eagerly\
  \ who had now switched roles and became our highly esteemed tour guide. Jogging\
  \ to keep up with his brisk pace, there were locals selling scarves, hats, gloves,\
  \ and coffee. I contemplated taking a break and having a steamy cup more times than\
  \ I\u2019d like to admit. The walk up felt like an eternity on numb toes; one more\
  \ step. Breathless, and we hadn\u2019t even begun walking up the wall, I still couldn\u2019\
  t see. The videos I watched didn\u2019t prepare me for this snow-covered trek. The\
  \ familiar Subway and Baskin Robins marked the location of the entrance and we finally\
  \ arrived at the lift, which would carry us above the naked forests to the Mutianyu\
  \ side of the Great Wall.\n\nSilence. I braced myself for the nerve-filled ride\
  \ up to a destination I had yet to lay eyes on. We were so far off the ground, I\
  \ held my breath each time I heard a creek from the thick cable that held my life\
  \ in its proverbial hands. And then I saw it, and the memory hit me like a bag of\
  \ rocks. I was four years old the first time I saw a picture of the Great Wall of\
  \ China. I could distinctly recall questioning my mom, with hows and whys as she\
  \ tried to explain its location in the world. A place, at the time that seemed so\
  \ far beyond the scope of my reality and hers. A NYC girl with big dreams, I knew\
  \ one day I would go. One day I would stand on the greatest wonder of my world and\
  \ take the same steps as millions before me. I knew I would see the sunset from\
  \ Mutianyu and be still in its embrace.\n\nJumping off of the quick moving lift,\
  \ we finally made it; I was standing on the Great Wall of China. Looking out into\
  \ the world there was nothing, no streets, no buildings, no semblance of life. It\
  \ made sense at that moment why I hadn\u2019t seen it from afar. When you\u2019\
  re standing on the wall, nothing else exists. I was in another world filled with\
  \ endless peaks and clouds and miles of meticulously placed stones battered by time.\
  \ The jagged stairs up and down and then up again, covered with ice made exploring\
  \ the towers a unique adventure. I was transformed into a voyager looking for anything\
  \ and nothing. Walking ahead, eager to be alone just me and the vast openness of\
  \ the world. Even with the snow-filled ground, the sky was bluer than I had ever\
  \ seen it, the sun blinding. Climbing the first of many towers, there was no doubt\
  \ in my mind, the best memories were made right there at the top. The stone marked\
  \ names of adventurers before me, were etched into the sides of the wall. I could\
  \ almost hear the laughter of the souls who had once stood in magnificence.\n\n\
  With everything I thought I knew, with every bit of expectancy I had, one thing\
  \ I didn\u2019t envision was desire. Wonderment, surprise, joy were all probable,\
  \ even anticipated but the desire that consumed me left me feeling full and empty\
  \ all at once. I was now standing at the precipice of where I am and where I\u2019\
  m going. And I knew, standing on that wall, I had to go everywhere, to see everything.\
  \ That travel far would be my life\u2019s motto. I now had another story I was obligated\
  \ to share with the world."
