Text: "\"Write your name in the log book.\"  The man behind the basement speakeasy\
  \ window instructed us.  My best friend Brittany and I obliged.  \"Should we use\
  \ our family names, or our current names?\"  We were on a quest to discover a piece\
  \ of our families' history, that until recently, neither of us knew we had, and\
  \ shared together.  Nine thousand miles from home,  on last minute trip, I was hopeful\
  \ discover more about my Grandmother's family.  We decided to give both names. \
  \ At 43, my Grandmother succumbed to breast cancer when my father was a boy.  Identical\
  \ in features, I spent most of my childhood wondering who she was.  With only a\
  \ single photograph of her 18 year old self, a 1930\u2019s advertisement photo in\
  \ the local newspaper, my Grandfather didn\u2019t speak of her and nor did my father\
  \ remember.  I was able to piece together her familial side via ancestry websites\
  \ and discovered.  There were a lot of family mysteries that began to unfurl the\
  \ deeper I dug, now a piece of that lineage laid behind the solid wood doors before\
  \ us.  If only the man behind these doors, in the basement of the Grand Lodge, would\
  \ grant us access.  My girlfriend was on her own quest of identity.  Brittany\u2019\
  s father died when she was a toddler.  Until a few months prior, she had never met\
  \ his side of the family.  This was a moment we both had longed for.   An authentic\
  \ Knights Templar suit of armor stared at us while we patiently waited to be verified.\
  \  \n\nI had never known much about Singapore before this trip as my studies and\
  \ travels were of ancient mesoamerica and the mysteries of megaliths.  A friend\
  \ was presenting at the infamous Marina Bay Sands Hotel, a destination of it's own,\
  \ and I jumped at the chance to join.  What Singapore lacks in megaliths, it makes\
  \ up in mysteries. Colonized by British Free Mason, Sir Thomas Raffles, and known\
  \ for the Singapore Sling, Singapore is a world financial  hub not to be overlooked.\
  \  Her harbors are full with ocean freight liners and wealth is abundant.  Luxury\
  \ labels line the shopping malls and the underground urban lifestyle is seductive.\
  \  We had afternoon tea at the infamous Raffles Hotel, tossed peanuts on the floor\
  \ with our Singapore Slings, peeked into a retirement party hosted by the World\
  \ Bank.  I purchased a pink dress that blended both British and Chinese needlepoint,\
  \ the embodiment of Singapore.  Everything in Singapore is luxurious.  Known for\
  \ a strict penal system and corporal punishment, the city state of Singapore is\
  \ incredibly safe.   I've never had to fill out immigration papers before in which\
  \ I had to acknowledge that certain actions were punishable by death.  Then again,\
  \ this security of safety is what enabled four women to be standing in a basement\
  \ entry, in the dark of night, talking to a man through a 6\" x 6\" piece of glass,\
  \ hoping to gain entry without concern. \n\n\"Please, come inside\" as the door\
  \ opened.  Nine thousand miles from home, we were welcomed as family, as we were\
  \ family, even if not by blood.  \"You will see your family names on our walls\"\
  \ and we did.  Hours passed chatting in the basement bar with members.  We couldn't\
  \ pull ourselves away.  I could feel my Grandmother's presence everywhere and finally\
  \ felt I understood a part of what happened that our broke the family apart 70 years\
  \ ago.  My Grandfather remarried into a new faith.  Differences of faith tore apart\
  \ my family after my Grandmother\u2019s death.  Now here, on the other side of the\
  \ world, I am being embraced and welcomed as family, even though I am a foreigner.\
  \  Family is not just blood, it's the bonds that ties us to each other however that\
  \ may be.  It is who embraces you that distance can not dictate nor divide.  When\
  \ we embarked on this adventure, we never thought my personal greatest mystery,\
  \ who we came from, would have light shed on it \u2026 and the discovery made it\
  \ my most memorable adventure yet."
