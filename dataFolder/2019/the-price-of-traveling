Text: "Traveling can be so expensive, but nor for me. My college friend always talked\
  \ to me about Europe, and how precious it was, I did not believe him until I got\
  \ there, Paris. There I was, at the aiport, knowing nothing about French but at\
  \ least, I was in Paris, the city of love. The funny thing is that I finnalIy got\
  \ to Paris after two days of trying to find a seat left in the flight since I had\
  \ one of those really cheap tickets where you can only fly if there is a seat left.\
  \ I was all ready for my new adventure, I even met a handsome guy who helped me\
  \ carry my luggage all the way to the metro so I could finally be with two of my\
  \ best friends since high school who were waiting for me at Versailles, such a cute\
  \ little city close to the big and famous Paris. \nOne of those two friends, Renata,\
  \ travelled with me around Europe, we made a little trip of two weeks; I only had\
  \ 40 euros for each day, had to make the most of it with 40 euros; museums, metro\
  \ pass, food, drinks, souvenirs. Some days were harder than others, but at least\
  \ I got to save enough money to buy the purse of my dreams in Madrid; we went to\
  \ the perfect outlet and I bought a purse I will probably have for the rest of my\
  \ life. Red, simple but elegant, medium size, classic, it was perfect, I knew I\
  \ had to buy it. After spending all of my savings of the trip, we went to 100 montaditos\
  \ since I could not afford any other meal, 1 euro for a montadito, how great; I\
  \ got lucky to find such a perfect place to eat that day. After Madrid, went to\
  \ Barcelona, probably my favorite city, the perfect city for everything; party,\
  \ eat, shop, walk, beach, everything. Then, went to the most famous city of Italy,\
  \ Venice, the city of water, could not went to Italy without visiting Venice. Visited\
  \ Rome as well, but nothing like Paris, good thing we had to go back to Paris to\
  \ fly from there back home, Mexico. I can totally say that my first trip to Europa\
  \ was, pretty great, pretty cheap. \n\nGetting to Paris was kind of easy, the stress\
  \ started when I knew I had to go back. The thing was, since I had one of those\
  \ cheap plane tickets, it was not easy to go back home. The first day, nothing,\
  \ the next day, nothing again; I started to get so stressed out since I did not\
  \ have any money left and I knew I had to get back the sooner, the better. The only\
  \ good thing was that I had someone to go back to close to Paris, my other friend\
  \ Ana, who was living in Versailles, one of the reasons I went to Europe, since\
  \ I had someone to stay with for as long as I wanted to; the cheaper, the better.\
  \ \nThe third day was my lucky day, I finally got a seat assigned for me, could\
  \ not be any happier, but not as happy as when I got there, Paris, my lovely Paris.\n\
  \nYup, traveling can be cheap."
