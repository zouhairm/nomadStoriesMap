Text: "The three of us set off early in the morning. It was raining, clouds rising\
  \ from the swathes of green, and we made arm and head holes in binbags for the walk\
  \ out of the jungle. \n\nIt was a long way to La Guajira: it would take most of\
  \ the day and send us out of the bustling surf towns of Coste\xF1o and Palomino\
  \ and into the most unforgiving desert of Colombia. Luckily, we found a van in Palomino\
  \ that would take us all the way there, along with two sisters from Barcelona, Monica\
  \ and Marta. Less luckily, the van broke down within ten minutes and we had to wait\
  \ at the side of the road for another, much smaller, car to arrive. \u2018Tranquilo\u2019\
  , they said.\n\nWe sat four across in the backseat of the Jeep, eating our avocado\
  \ and cheese sandwiches out of our hats. We must have fallen asleep because all\
  \ of a sudden we were in Cuatro V\xEDas, a kind of wasteland crossroads in the middle\
  \ of nowhere. Dull sand stretched as far as the eye could see. A sad injured dog\
  \ lay on the ground. I got out of the Jeep to buy treats for the children they told\
  \ us would be waiting. Even as we got back in the car, they were running up with\
  \ hands outstretched. Monica handed lollipops through the window and they ran alongside\
  \ the car, laughing, as we drove away. \u2018It\u2019s a game to them now\u2019\
  , our driver told us.\n \nWe drove further into the desert; thrown side to side\
  \ in the Jeep, bumping over mud tracks as rain flecked the windscreen. The car swerved\
  \ around bushes and past puddles, the normal road having been destroyed by the rain\
  \ that comes to the desert once every three years. A man in pink cycled his bike\
  \ over sand and sparseness.\n\nWe finally arrived in Cabo de la Vela, which was\
  \ not much more than a few shacks and huts spread along the mud track. The light\
  \ was hazy and strange and somehow otherworldly. The sky was huge above us. On one\
  \ side sandy mountains, and flat, still water on the other. Quietness reigned. \n\
  In the evening we went to the beach. The darkness was total, the only light coming\
  \ from candles in plastic bottles. The moon was tilted further on its side than\
  \ I had ever seen at home and it seemed to be smiling down on us. Umpi would later\
  \ tell us that\u2019s why people in the Caribbean are so happy. \n\nDark figures\
  \ came to join us one by one until we became a large circle, gathered around the\
  \ dull light of the bottled candle. It was impossible to say what anyone looked\
  \ like. But ask any one of them what they were doing here, at the end of the land,\
  \ and they would say one thing: \u2018the kite, I\u2019m here for the kite.\u2019\
  \n\nA passionfruit cocktail in a bucket was passed around. Reggaeton shattered the\
  \ eerie silence and the Colombians began to dance.  \n\n\n\nThe next day we woke\
  \ in our chinchorros to the light of the day and the sound of soft waves lapping\
  \ in the distance. The kiteboarders were sat around the table, drinking black coffee\
  \ and playing cambio. \n\n\u2018What are you doing today?\u2019 we asked.\n\n\u2018\
  Waiting for the wind,\u2019 came the unanimous reply.\n\nWe took motorbikes to the\
  \ Cueva del Diablo, breezing across grey-orange sand and spiny plants struggling\
  \ to the top. Arriving on a hill of rocky sand and stone and desolation, we looked\
  \ down on the glassy blue water below: you could hardly tell where the sky ended\
  \ and the sea began. Giant iguanas scurried across the rocks. We made our way down\
  \ the shaly bank to the beach, where the pebbles were soft and black and sea-worn.\
  \ We swam out with Monica and Marta and Boris and Santa into the cueva. Crabs scrambled\
  \ up the walls and waves crashed upon the rocks. \n\nAs we went back, speeding closer\
  \ and closer to the town, we finally saw them. Above the sea and above the far-off\
  \ mountains, kites drifted and swirled and danced in the empty sky."
