Text: "On a July night somewhere in the Borneo jungle, I share a twin size mattress\
  \ with two girls. They guess they are around 16, but age doesn\u2019t seem to matter\
  \ here and neither does time, the day\u2019s progression guided by the sun\u2019\
  s movements detached from numbers. We can\u2019t understand each other, me with\
  \ my English speaking tongue, the girls, their indigenous Dusun. They do not attend\
  \ school, and both will likely marry soon, having several children well before my\
  \ own age. Without electricity, sunset calls them to bed, sunrise to wake. Their\
  \ days are filled with careful little motions- cleaning, chopping homegrown vegetables,\
  \ tending to smaller children. While fulfilling their daily tasks, they also look\
  \ after their petite mother, who sits hunched over beside the open back door, looking\
  \ towards the rainforest for something unknown to me. In the early evening, the\
  \ girls each hold an arm, leading her to bed. They pause briefly in front of me.\
  \ I take her little hand and place my own to my heart, the sign of respect in Malaysian\
  \ culture. She nods approvingly. Before sleep, the girls\u2019 expert hands peel\
  \ garlic for the following day in swift, adept movements, tossing each clove into\
  \ a large woven basket. I peek over my torchlit book to watch. They are silent,\
  \ but glance occasionally at each other. \n\nThe girls and I seem to have little\
  \ in common besides our biological sex, the thread uniting us in the stilted wooden\
  \ room, isolated from the men who severely outnumber us. When I wake in the middle\
  \ of the night to the rain bursting through the seam of the window pane, it takes\
  \ me awhile to remember where I am. As my eyes adjust, the girls are still. They\
  \ breathe slowly and deeply, undisturbed by the storm. I feel surprised, almost\
  \ intrusive, at the jarring intimacy of this moment, for there is a strange vulnerability\
  \ in sharing a bed with strangers, in waking up somewhere so distant from home,\
  \ in a place so dark you can\u2019t see your own outstretched hand. Yet it was simultaneously\
  \ comforting to be near these women, so close I could feel El shiver and move nearer\
  \ to me with every crisp draft. At dawn I wake up alone, cloaked with an extra blanket\
  \ and El\u2019s pillow beneath my head. \n\nThis was my first night volunteering\
  \ with Light Up Borneo, a local NGO that brings electricity to remote kampungs using\
  \ hydroelectric technology; in this case, a fancy name for using a waterfall and\
  \ handmade turbine to create all-natural and free light. The NGO was fairly new,\
  \ in response to the vast need for electricity in the interior region. I heard about\
  \ the project through a Malaysian friend; alas, I arrived at the meeting point three\
  \ hours from my home, only to find I was the single woman volunteer. I hopped in\
  \ a 4x4 crammed with men anyway and caravanned five hours to the project site, plowing\
  \ through thick jungle on a long and bumpy dirt road. As the only female volunteer\
  \ and hyper aware of my vulnerability, I found myself gravitating towards the village\
  \ women despite language and cultural barriers. Following each day of manual labor\
  \ with the male crew, I quietly assisted the women with housework and cooking in\
  \ the evening. I routinely brought out my Uno cards in El\u2019s room at night.\
  \ In the morning, we merely smiled and nodded at each other, as if we had a secret\
  \ no one else knew. With the village women, I found an unspoken solidarity and sense\
  \ of safety. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking lately about vulnerability and the vast\
  \ ways this concept has manifested itself to me throughout my travel. Travel forces\
  \ us to be vulnerable in ways we can't imagine- to be unbelievably trusting of people,\
  \ to accept foods and invitations and friendships without questioning motives and\
  \ implications. With this trust comes abounding new adventures and deep relationships,\
  \ as well as a greater understanding of a place. Our journeys are not over when\
  \ we leave a place, but rather, part of a continuing evolution of who we are and\
  \ who we decide to be."
