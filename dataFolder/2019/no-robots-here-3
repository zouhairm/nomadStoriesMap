Text: "I am going to take a gamble here and start my story by revisiting my twelve-year-old\
  \ self coming to America for the first time and the high expectations I came with,\
  \ and finally finding my home.\n\nI was raised in Angola, Africa, during a time\
  \ of great conflict. Angola suffered one of the longest civil wars in Africa; it\
  \ was one of several Portuguese colonized territories in Africa.  In times of chaos\
  \ I would be sent to JUSTA, a refugee camp for foreigners, before being shipped\
  \ back to my country of birth, Cape Verde Islands; where I remained waiting for\
  \ processing to come to America.  All of my family had found their way here, minus\
  \ my older brother and me; we were last to arrive.\n\nAs a kid, I spent many nights\
  \ fantasizing about America, the great, the beautiful, the promise land. I would\
  \ lay on the sand in the warm tropical breeze, underneath endless stars mapping\
  \ out my destiny. With my invisible knife, I would cut a giant x across the sky,\
  \ followed by a cross to make eight slices of pie in the sky.  I took the biggest\
  \ piece to offer to my dying sister who was fighting cancer so that she would have\
  \ her piece of pie in the sky.  I was sold countless stories of the greatness of\
  \ America: There would be skyscrapers the height of heaven, cars that drive themselves,\
  \ beautiful dresses to wear every day, not just on Sundays, and robots that would\
  \ do all the chores. I was especially thrilled about the last one.  Like any other\
  \ hot-blooded kid, I hated doing chores. Finally, the day for my departure into\
  \ the unknown had come. The entire village gathered to see me off with good wishes.\
  \ After an exhaustive journey, I landed in Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport\
  \ one foggy, dreary May day and emerged from the haze with a clearer vision, and\
  \ thought to myself, oh my God! The plane took a wrong turn, I\u2019m supposed to\
  \ land on Mars.  Where are my robots? The disappointments only grew. Standing before\
  \ me eagerly awaiting my arrival, were all the members of my family, minus my angelic\
  \ beautiful sister who had lost her battle with cancer.  America with all its magnificence\
  \ could not cure the cancer.  My sister who had survived war and famine had come\
  \ to America only to die. In short, America, the promise land, was not keeping all\
  \ its promises.\n\nDespite our bumpy start, America has become, for better or worse,\
  \ my one true home.  There is so much to love about this land and equally as much\
  \ to hate.  It is not one country, it is a world condensed into one. In New York\
  \ City, on the Island of Manhattan, one can travel from Latin America to Italy,\
  \ to China and Russia, and back again, all in one day\u2019s commute and two dollars\
  \ and seventy-five cents -- where else can one travel the globe without ever stamping\
  \ one\u2019s passport. My day begins with a friendly smile and a jovial good morning\
  \ from the heavy accented Jamaican crossing guard as I walk past the Puerto Rican\
  \ flag, proudly flapping against the bright blue sky. The Dominican hair stylists\
  \ at the corner salon rhythmically tidy up to the sounds of merengue as they prepare\
  \ to open up for the day. Five streets south and four avenues west I am transported\
  \ back to Africa. I am deep in nostalgia, comforted by the colors and scents of\
  \ home in the Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market in Little Senegal.  After a twenty-minute\
  \ ride in the oppressively hot, crowded subway train, I\u2019m in Chinatown walking\
  \ by perfectly roasted Peking duck hung up on restaurant windows. My nostrils are\
  \ subjected to a variety of smells of the Orient.  As I navigate the heavily populated\
  \ sidewalks, this song comes to mind, this land is your land, this land is my land\u2026\
  \ These lyrics have never echoed truer or louder than today.\n\nI have not found\
  \ any robots.  I do not live in a tall skyscraper, I live on a fourth-floor walk-up,\
  \ but outside my window is an entire world.\nIf I had to be stranded on an island,\
  \ I\u2019d pick this one."
