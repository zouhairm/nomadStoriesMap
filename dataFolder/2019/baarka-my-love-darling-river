Text: "At the end of 2018, I travelled to Bourke and Brewarrina in Northwest NSW with\
  \ their rich Aboriginal history and culture.\n\nBumping along the dirt track, the\
  \ elder Baarkinji women, our hosts didn\u2019t say much, they were scanning the\
  \ road for roos and emus which have a tendency to dart across at the last minute,\
  \ although the quietness could also have been a few nerves as our minivan skidded\
  \ across the bulldust or lurched and groaned as we hit a big rock.\n\nOn arriving,\
  \ our hosts seemed more nimble than when we pulled ourselves into the minivan earlier\
  \ this morning. There is being on country, and being in special places on country.\
  \ This was a special women\u2019s place and it energised us. There was a scramble\
  \ to arrange tea and cheese and bickies and everyone pitched in chatting and laughing.\
  \ \n\nCoolibah trees sheltered us from the harsh sun. Behind us, vast ochre-coloured\
  \ floodplains stretched out to a horizon dotted with trees. The river wasn\u2019\
  t visible in front of us because of its steep banks but as it curved further along\
  \ we could see glints of water between outcrops of black rocks.\n\nThe rivers name\
  \ is Baarka, which my Baarkinji friend Paul tells me means \u2018darling\u2019,\
  \ loved one. This one word embeds connection and love. Baarka is not a human or\
  \ a plant or an animal, but it is a force of life. Our rivers come from sacred places,\
  \ from the tops of mountains, sides of gullies, and fed from tropical storms in\
  \ the north. Rivers are our lifeblood, and are paths that connect us.\n\nWe sat\
  \ longer, drank tea and listened. Stories about this river and the old people. As\
  \ the afternoon edges on and the others became quieter in their own thoughts I take\
  \ a look around. \n\nThis isn\u2019t my country, and I knew I had to be careful,\
  \ meaning respectful of sacred land. I used my caution walking along the river bank.\
  \ Some places communicate, give us a sense of recognition or certain feelings, and\
  \ sometimes, they communicate a threat, to tell you where you shouldn\u2019t be.\
  \ \n\nI didn\u2019t get any harsh warnings. Instead, an enchanting sense of comfort\
  \ and excited happiness welled up inside me. Perhaps a leak of oxytocin, the attachment\
  \ hormone concerned with birth and mothers milk? This was a women\u2019s place,\
  \ this was a mother\u2019s place. A natural depression alongside the riverbank was\
  \ flanked by trees whose rough outstretched limbs skimmed a meter or so from the\
  \ ground. A place of shade and soft earth a few steps away from where the water\u2019\
  s edge would normally be. Down further were circular rocks fish traps. Good for\
  \ a sustaining feed of fish for the birthing woman and her attendants.\n\nI imagined\
  \ a scene. A circle of women helping each other, Baarka providing relief and nourishment\
  \ and smoke scenting the air. Babies born and nestled against their mothers. The\
  \ intensity of childbirth, the border between life and death. Generation after generation\
  \ over thousands and thousands of years. How many babies were born here? What beautiful\
  \ stories were created on this river bank?  This is a sacred place. Baarka, the\
  \ ultimate midwife and mother. \n\nPeople visiting here do not know the Darling\
  \ River's importance. There is no sign, no plaque. Many may think this was empty\
  \ land - Terra Nullius. Because of our nations ignorance of this beauty, we have\
  \ cut off this river, the lifeblood of the people here, the Baarkinji and further\
  \ along, the Ngemba and many other mobs to . And what happens if you cut off someones\
  \ bloodstream?         \n\nToday, the river is shrunken, sluggish and malodorous.\
  \ Where Baarka would have naturally widened as it snaked along, the old trees, coolibahs\
  \ and huge river gums looked tortured. They balance on their exposed spindly roots.\
  \ The regular floods that are needed to replenish the land don\u2019t happen anymore.\
  \ The greedy dams have taken the water, weirs have been built blocking the natural\
  \ flow, and introduced carp thud against its banks. Many of the thirty thousand\
  \ year old fish traps have been dynamited. This river has been abused then ignored.\
  \     \n\nBaarka is the Darling river and our darling is in her death throes."
