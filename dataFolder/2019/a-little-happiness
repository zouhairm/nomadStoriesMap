Text: "As the train pulled into the station I tossed my backpack over my shoulder\
  \ and pressed out into the crowded platform. At this point, the silky layer of moisture\
  \ over my skin was a part of the day to day. By now it was noon, the sun high in\
  \ the sky, a breath of humid air in my lungs. I had arrived to Alwar, Rajasthan.\
  \ Just a few steps forward and his eyes locked on mine. I knew it was Saadhguru\
  \ Sing looking my way. I was surprised at how quickly he had found me. He stood\
  \ about 4'6, dark brown skin, big eyes, wearing a bright orange turban and a baggy\
  \ white shirt similar to mine. \n\nHe walked my way and greeted me with a smile,\
  \ we stood in the understanding that we could not communicate by words. Saadhguru\
  \ took me by the hand and pulled me through the crowds of the Agra station, out\
  \ the front entrance, passing cows, camels and street dogs along the way, weaving\
  \ through stationed cars honking their horns in traffic, until we arrived to a tuk-tuk\
  \ Saadghuru approved of. He pulled me onto his lap while we piled in a family of\
  \ four in the backseat next to us. I patiently sat in disbelief as each passenger\
  \ piled into what was technically a seat for three, and off we went, the fresh air\
  \ finally blowing through my hair. \n\nAs the last to vacate the vehicle, alas we\
  \ had made it to the site I had anticipated for years. Crossing under the bridge\
  \ to its other side, we peered out. Saadghuru let my hand go for the first time\
  \ since he had picked me up. What I didn't expect to find was 45 beautiful faces\
  \ all crowded together looking directly at me. They were expecting me. I froze,\
  \ with a smile on my face, tears in my eyes, I snapped as many photos as I could\
  \ of the moment that would then become one of the most special meetings of my life\
  \ before falling on my knees to greet the children. They crowded around me. While\
  \ we didn't speak a lick of the other's language, we laughed, hugged, and took pictures\
  \ together. What a magical way to meet a whole community of people whom I had never\
  \ been in direct contact with. \n\nThis was the first time I met the Sikligars of\
  \ A Little Happiness Foundation, a community of traditional blacksmiths ostracized\
  \ by their government, living in poverty for generations. We had opened the Canadian\
  \ branch of the foundation to work with them internationally in hopes to massage\
  \ the wealth gap between our nations and unite with education as a dream. The children\
  \ and I spent the following days painting a mural on the wall of their school. When\
  \ reporting back to my team in Canada, that the money we had fundraised was buying\
  \ school supplies and uniforms for the children in my photos, I knew we had done\
  \ something right."
