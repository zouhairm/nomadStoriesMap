Text: "August. It seemed that summer sun should warm not only body but also soul.\
  \ But here, in the Pamirs, the air temperature at this time is already -8 degrees\
  \ Celsius. And in  winter it is up to -60 degrees Celsius. Population of Kyrgyz\
  \ people on Pamir is 1500 people and they all resist in such climate condition.They\
  \ live here not legally, because most people here do not have documents. But this\
  \ doesn\u2019t bother them, because they are far from such concepts of civilization\
  \ as money, electricity and technology. \nBut how do they feed themselves then?\
  \ Their main occupation is cattle breeding: they keep camels, yaks, horses and rams.\
  \ People begin to learn the art of animal husbandry from childhood. There is a belief\
  \ that the boy becomes a man only after being able to overtake the multi-soot cattle\
  \ over long distances despite the frosts without somebody's help.\nBut even for\
  \ girls  trials and troubles of life begin at the age of 12-13. Because at this\
  \ age they get married to men who suit them as fathers. Half of these girls die\
  \ during giving birth. But such risk is justified by the fact that there is the\
  \ greatest mortality among the female due to weather conditions, therefore there\
  \ is an unequal number among the sexes.  \nDo these people receive primary education\
  \ and medical care? School opened in the Small Pamir 5 years ago, but only children\
  \ of rich families can afford this luxury. Also it is impossible for all people\
  \ to get checked by doctor because there is no hospital nearby. Therefore, one has\
  \ to rely only on his strong immunity. \nDespite this harsh life, the Pamir Kyrgyz\
  \ people  observe and honor their traditions: they wear traditional clothes made\
  \ of wool, sing old Kyrgyz songs and live according to the principle \"the younger\
  \ respects the adult.\"\nAlthough I saw all these things only through the TV screen,\
  \ I felt connected with my ancestors and I believe that one day we can return them\
  \ all to our historical homeland and provide them bright future."
