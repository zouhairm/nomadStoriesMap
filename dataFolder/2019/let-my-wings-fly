Text: "Being a human has its advantages.\nSometimes you can just close your eyes and\
  \ travel on the wings of dreams and hopes. I have been writing my whole life. Actually\
  \ \u2013 writing is the only thing I know that will never leave me alone. \nWhat\
  \ does it mean to write? For me it\u2019s something I cannot do. I have been trying\
  \ many times to stop it. But then I travel \u2013 literally or in a dreamed world,\
  \ and the words come to grab me, change me and leave me more myself than ever. \n\
  I\u2019ve been blogging for the last seven years \u2013 Flights and words is the\
  \ online home of two poetry books \u2013 \u201CSky made for birds\u201D and \u201C\
  Water talks\u201D. It was not easy to keep blogging \u2013 as a young person I have\
  \ my ups and downs often, I am used to doubt my skills and talent, and the meaning\
  \ of blogging. But never the meaning of writing. I am very keen on storytelling\
  \ and truly believe it is the right time to travel and make a whole new story alive\u2013\
  \ maybe that trip is what I need for a new poetry book or a first novel book. \n\
  I started this year with a board game called Azul, inspired by the Portuguese history\
  \ and culture. In some way it made me dream about writing even more, the small white\
  \ and blue tiles in my hands excited my mind. Then the first book I read this year\
  \ came to be a Portuguese collection of poetry. I fell in love with the poems, I\
  \ was diving and sinking into a whole new world. \nI\u2019ve been dreaming for Portugal\
  \ for some reason \u2013 maybe the unknown has been calling me, maybe it\u2019s\
  \ the natural feeling that travelling to this country will make my story alive,\
  \ will reborn the sense of being a writer or teach me new ways to express myself.\
  \ Maybe watching the sky in a new place will wake my senses. \nI am no longer trying\
  \ to find the place that belongs to me and to which I belong entirely. I realized\
  \ that this place exists, but not as a geographical location, but within myself.\
  \ I carry it with myself, like a passport, with which I go back to old places and\
  \ find new ones, and they \u2013 even for a while - become mine and I - theirs."
