Text: "It is 11:32 PM in Oruro, Bolivia, and I have missed the midnight mass of Nochebuena.\
  \ As I walk up the steps of the cathedral, its iron-handled double doors suddenly\
  \ swing wide open with a dramatic thud against the huge stone walls. Orure\xF1o\
  \ families pour out of the building and into the storm. Mothers hold their aguayo-wrapped\
  \ infants close, men clap each other on the back, and everyone opens umbrellas.\
  \ All at once, the whole plaza is flooded with their devout chatter, and bright\
  \ light from the chandeliers.\n\nI\u2019ve been here for only four months, but I\
  \ know that this service should have only started an hour from now. A dizzying spell\
  \ of disappointment and divine silence washes over me. I hold my thin, floppy journal\
  \ over my head and scurry inside to escape the deluge.\n\nOruro's cathedral is a\
  \ classical, magnificent place of worship, framed with dusty Spanish stained glass,\
  \ populated with pews of oak and a central altar of marble. Candles have been burning\
  \ for hours, and incense fills the hallowed space with thick wisps of holy smoke.\n\
  \nThis Christmas Eve, a blustery night of sharp rain and bitter wind, marks my first\
  \ Christmas away from home. After these interminable months of studying abroad,\
  \ I\xB4ve felt wound up and worn out, and I long for release. I'm not sure what\
  \ I expected to find here tonight. Solace, maybe, or spiritual communion through\
  \ sermon and prayer. But all that remains is a few chatty teenagers and hushed elderly\
  \ couples.\n\nI kneel and relinquish myself to prayer. I cannot remember much of\
  \ what I said, but that I asked for safety. Safe passage through this journey and\
  \ home, and safety for my loved ones. After a brief conversation with divinity,\
  \ I realize that I have not eaten for many hours.\n\nSo I exit the cathedral and\
  \ make for the center of town. I walk, soaked and shivering, through a labyrinth\
  \ of cobbled streets, criss-crossed with Christmas lights and wrought-iron lamps.\
  \ I begin to hear voices swirl around me, as if carried on the wind. Further along\
  \ and now very close to my hotel bed, I pass food carts selling salte\xF1as, the\
  \ Bolivian empanada: sweet, fried pouches of dough, filled with spices, meats, and\
  \ herbs -- vegetables if you\xB4re lucky.\n\nAll at once, the winding streets open\
  \ up into Oruro's avenida principal. Cars whiz past and orchestral Christmas music\
  \ sounds from many storefronts. I follow the sidewalk west toward what I hope can\
  \ help fill the hollow longing in my gut, even if only in a literal sense. And!\
  \ Lo! I can smell it even before I see it: El Mercado Central. \n\nThe market buzzes\
  \ and sizzles with yuletide festivities. I pass oil barrels on fire, grilling ears\
  \ of white corn known as choclo. I pass salesmen hawking artesano jewelry, I pass\
  \ hanging llama fetuses and big curbside bags of coca leaves. I pass vendor tents\
  \ selling resplendent arrays of children\u2019s toys that blink and bleep and whir.\
  \   \n\nMy nose leads me to a restaurant-cubicle in a quiet corner of the sprawling\
  \ market complex. A scheme of white and soft blue adorns the walls, with many hanging\
  \ depictions of Christ. Soft pe\xF1a music reverberates through tiny USB speakers.\
  \ I take my seat upon a small stool amidst a wordless and anonymous coalition of\
  \ four other men. Each of us, for some reason or another, is alone right now after\
  \ midnight on Nochebuena. Like perfect strangers, we make hopeful, wordless eye\
  \ contact, the likes of which I have seen before in hospital waiting rooms.\n\n\
  I ask the chef, a stout cholita woman with Audrey Hepburn eyes and auburn hair,\
  \ what I should order. She grins and makes me up a bowl of salted llama jerky, with\
  \ potatoes and corn, and a side of llajwa, Bolivia\u2019s prized tomato and chili\
  \ salsa.\n\nI realize now what I\u2019ve been seeking all along: something to make\
  \ me feel at home. Something like this charquekhan corner, on Christmas Eve, full\
  \ of silent men in smiling solidarity. Although I\u2019m very far from my family\u2019\
  s driveway bonfire, at this moment I am warm, safe, and happily full of food. Just\
  \ like my mother has been praying for."
