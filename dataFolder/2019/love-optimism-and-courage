Text: "Just after 10 days of applying, here I was holding my visa to Russia. For the\
  \ last 2.5 years, I had done this a hundred times in my thoughts and imagination,\
  \  yet it took me enough time to make a real move. I had waited long and so did\
  \ she, considering that we dated only 6 months and it has been over 2 years since\
  \ we last met. \n\nI knew about the bone-chilling winters and below -10\xB0C temperatures\
  \ of Russia and yet the thought of travelling there on New Year didn't scare me.\
  \ Despite the fact that I was an Indian who had never experienced temperatures below\
  \ 4\xB0C, I was still excited and optimistic about this trip. \n\nThe real problem\
  \ for me was not the winters but to meet her, it has been over 3 months that we\
  \ were not in good terms. I was trying to save a relationship that she just didn't\
  \ want to. I was an Indian, belonging to religious Sikh family and she was a Russian,\
  \ young, confident and not a believer of religions, yet we had a connection that\
  \ felt surreal. But just like any other cross-cultural couple we always had doubt\
  \ about our future and this time it seemed like she had made up her mind. \n\nShe\
  \ had told me not to talk, chat or connect with her by any means and my response\
  \ was \"I am coming to Russia\". I had never been on a flight, never travelled out\
  \ of India and never travelled solo before, but this time I was doing it all. As\
  \ I got down on snow-covered Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow, I felt proud of myself.\
  \ I had taken the most courageous decision of my life so far, and it wouldn't have\
  \ happened without love. I realised that love doesn't make us weak, it makes us\
  \ vulnerable and yet it gives us the courage to do things that we ourselves could\
  \ have never thought. \n\nAt the airport, there was nobody to receive me and I was\
  \ supposed to reach my Couchsurfing host all by myself. I had no contacts here but\
  \ I had enough kind people around me to help me out. I had always heard that Russians\
  \ are not helpful but rude, however, my experience was nowhere close to what I had\
  \ heard. From the kind man who guided me to reach the Metro station, to the concerned\
  \ fellow who helped me reach my destination I found enough help in Russia all the\
  \ time. My host in Katy, took her entire day off to show me around the Moscow city.\
  \ I  saw people continuously looking at my head,  and some of them even asked if\
  \ they can have a picture with me, I believe my colourful turban had them curious.\
  \ Russia was not as cold as I expected it to be, It was warm. Even though snow covered\
  \ almost everything, it was people who made my experience warm and comfortable from\
  \ the very beginning. \n\nAfter two days of bonding well with my host and her mother,\
  \ enjoying their sweet hospitality just like their homemade blueberry jam, I was\
  \ finally moving on to what I had come for. Excited and nervous at the same time,\
  \ I reached Yaroslavl, got down from my train and walked towards the exit. With\
  \ each step that I took, I could feel my heartbeat, I was going to see her after\
  \ 2 years. I was about to meet the women I loved, her blue eyes and face were constantly\
  \ on my mind, for those few minutes I had forgotten that we were going through a\
  \ break-up and all I could think was to have look at her again. \n\nI came out and\
  \ I saw her, my eyes could still spot here, she was looking as beautiful as she\
  \ always looked, maybe even more. I smiled at her and open my arms wide, she smiled\
  \ back but put forward her hand. My hug turned into a handshake, it wasn't the start\
  \ that I expected, but I was still happy, I still had 7 days to see her and to make\
  \ things better. \n\nWho knew I would travel the world for love, who knows what\
  \ happens next!"
