Text: "We pull our suitcases over the wooden floor of the East Amsterdam apartment\
  \ we\u2019d be staying for the next few days. Eva and Ruben, the owners, welcome\
  \ us with a warm smile and get ready to give a grand tour of the house. She tells\
  \ me their neighborhood is considered the most culturally diverse in the city and,\
  \ although undergoing a slow process of gentrification, Indische Buurt is majorly\
  \ composed of foreign descent citizens and a strong muslim community.\n\nAfter introducing\
  \ us to what they call \u201Csome real dutch cheese\u201D, they leave for a vacation\
  \ getaway in Ruben\u2019s brother boathouse. Their little kid would be going with\
  \ them, but the cat, Puss, was now the official host and our task was to take very\
  \ good care of it.\n\nAs we wander through the streets full of social housing blocks,\
  \ tales of a past simpler than the rest of pretty high-profile city, a group of\
  \ three women wearing their hijabs chat on the bench of a small park while their\
  \ kids play some variation a leapfrog game I had never seen before.\n\nA little\
  \ further down the main street, there\u2019s a bunch of little caf\xE9s and some\
  \ restaurants decorated in full European hipster style, with cozy balconies springing\
  \ through the sidewalks. It\u2019s all so vibrant yet inviting I can\u2019t help\
  \ but sit on one of the tables and order fries with mayonnaise, in all its dutch\
  \ iconic glory.\n \nLikely, everybody knows we don\u2019t live there. Nothing but\
  \ tourists lost somewhere in the world. In such a small and residential neighborhood,\
  \ we were probably the only ones that day (and I\u2019m wearing my Christ the redeemer\
  \ shirt anyway, so it\u2019s not a big secret). But maybe nobody cares. Amidst a\
  \ wave of xenophobia and nationalism fast rising throughout the continent, maybe\
  \ nobody thinks we\u2019re there to blow up a bomb or steal their jobs.\n\nIn the\
  \ crossroad between the two busiest streets, a guy belts the notes to Jimmy Cliff\u2019\
  s \u201Cmany rivers to cross\u201D, only his microphone stand and a ukulele in hands,\
  \ while the sun is setting behind the dark brick buildings. If I had to pick a moment\
  \ that reminded me of comfort, it would be this one.\n\nWhen we return to the apartment,\
  \ I notice a fixture that had inattentively passed me by before. A pride flag hanging\
  \ in one of the porches of a building some blocks beside our own. A part of the\
  \ scene. Fitting to a neighborhood so full of contrasts it somehow reminded me of\
  \ my own.\n\nOn our last night in that place, I repeat the routine of filling Puss\u2019\
  s bowl with cat food, but skip the part of cleaning the day clothes with a cat fur\
  \ remover. It was all over the place now, already a part of the outfit. Turns out\
  \ it was quite an affectionate cat. A \u201Cshe\u201D, as Eva had reminded me.\n\
  \nI take a little time to look over the piles and shelves packed with so many books\
  \ I couldn\u2019t even count. A corridor full of them. Between those, I find a copy\
  \ of my ever favorite \u201COne hundred years of solitude\u201D, translated in dutch.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t comprehend a single word from those lines, but the story was already\
  \ so familiar it was like I was a native language speaker. Flipping through the\
  \ pages that told tales of the Buend\xEDa family\u2019s misfortune, I could feel\
  \ somehow closer to home, even so many miles away.\n\nCan we find similarities or\
  \ shared experiences anywhere we go in the globe? Was it just my roots and background\
  \ permeating the lenses through which I see things? Or was it that Amsterdam is\
  \ still too close to my country when we think about the western part of the world?\
  \ I like to embrace the first option. But then, there\u2019s still so much to see\
  \ out there.\n\nWhen Eva and Ruben return to the apartment, I tell them I had been\
  \ accidentally run over by a bike when trying to read a caf\xE9 menu on a sidewalk.\
  \ She tells me that \u201Cnow I could say I had really lived a dutch experience\u201D\
  . They still send me cute pictures of Puss every now and then."
