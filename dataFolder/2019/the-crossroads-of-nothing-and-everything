Text: "After three days of backpacking, not even the heartiest of Irish breakfasts\
  \ could have woken me up any earlier. My body was sore, my brain was fried, and\
  \ the weather outside provided no motivation. Even my hiking boots, plastered in\
  \ mud from the previous day, stuck their tongues out in rebellion of the untimely\
  \ sunrise.\n\nYet the coffee was black, the blood sausage was hot, and the fruit\
  \ was ripe. It may not be easy, but these next twelve miles from Glendalough to\
  \ Glenmalure will be well worth it. \n\nThat worth was just about to be tested:\
  \ not even one hundred yards from the door to the Inn, Lady Ireland released her\
  \ infamous waterworks. Downpour rain quickly enveloped us, a flock of scrambling\
  \ hikers trying to find their pack covers amidst cold hands and slick zippers. The\
  \ hoods were up, packs became hermetically sealed, and food was stashed in any and\
  \ every reachable pocket. The march of soggy hikers could finally begin, a methodical\
  \ line of polyester, starkly contrasting the natural world surrounding us. \n\n\
  The entire trip prior to this day was filled with jokes and laughter. Stories of\
  \ our respective pasts danced on the shoulders of our backpacks, memories of this\
  \ hike were gathered and distributed over a pint or two (or three); strangers became\
  \ friends. Nature was in the background of what was happening between us. Yet today\
  \ was a very different story. Today we were forced to listen to what Nature had\
  \ to say, which left all of us speechless. That, or the torrential rain knocking\
  \ on my hood refused to let me hear anyone around me.\n\nFor three hours the rain\
  \ left all of us casted in silence, where for the first time in all of my travels\
  \ stateside and abroad I actually felt alone. Not a lonely feeling where you miss\
  \ someone or something. More of a loss of an internal direction, which cascaded\
  \ me with thousands of thoughts, questions, and even a few words. From that chaos,\
  \ this is what came out.         \n\n\nNothing is sweeter than the sound of rocks\n\
  Being shifted below my feet.\nThe earth accepts each blowing step\nAnd yet I leave\
  \ no visible trace.\nThis path I walk has brought me\n\nNothing,\nEverything.\n\n\
  My breath fills the cold, motionless mountain air\nFor a second\nA moment\nUntil\
  \ it dissipates and becomes replaced\nBy my next heavy thought.\nEach breath is\
  \ my own,\nFrom my own two lungs; this air is mine.\nYet the towering trees suffocate\
  \ my breath\nBefore it can even see daylight.\nThe breath I breathe, my own exhaust,\n\
  Is not my own, it\u2019s\n\nNothing,\nEverything.\n\nEverything seems so quiet in\
  \ the mountains,\nUntil I am there to hear it speak.\nBirds chirp\nWind screams\n\
  Mud squelches\nWater beckons\nFog whispers\nWood creaks\nTrees tumble\nAt home we\
  \ have these noises,\nBut they are only sounds.\nAren\u2019t they?\nHere, these\
  \ songs are\nIndescribable\nThey are\n\nNothing,\nEverything.\n\nAll on this mountain\n\
  Leaves me speechless.\nI\u2019ve arrived at the crossroads of\n\nNothing\nAnd\n\
  Everything\n\nStripped of my sense of direction\n\nWhich way did I come from?\n\
  Which way am I going?\n\nAs we approached Glenmalure, the rain seized up and decided\
  \ to retreat for the day. The setting sun was only now peaking through the storm\
  \ clouds; a small glimpse of a brighter tomorrow snuck its way in from the cracks.\
  \ That night, after I peeled off the cold, wet clothing that painted my body, I\
  \ wrote the aforementioned poem. For the first time in a very long time, I felt\
  \ alive. Not because I was abroad in a picturesque, Instagram-worthy setting. Not\
  \ because I was engulfed by nature and all of its wonders. It came down to the fact\
  \ that I was present, in a moment that was not my own. For that small window of\
  \ my existence, I was experiencing a life that did not belong to me. \n\nThat night\
  \ I lay in a new bed, one that has seen thousands of other travelers, wondering\
  \ what lives they must\u2019ve lived. The steps they\u2019ve taken, the breaths\
  \ they breathed.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to share breakfast with them come morning."
