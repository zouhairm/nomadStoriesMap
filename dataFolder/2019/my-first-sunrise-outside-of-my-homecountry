Text: "I couldn't wait till the light shows up on my window. I was going to witness\
  \ the first sunrise outside of my home country. \nA warm sunny day of August has\
  \ started and the only thing scheduled for this day was to embrace Bangkok's spirit,\
  \ so I headed to the Grand Palace. The Grand Palace is a complex of buildings with\
  \ a construction dating back to 1782 and a service of around two centuries as a\
  \ base to the king, his court and his royal government. I heard a lot of stories\
  \ about this magical place and read a lot about it but nothing really prepared me\
  \ enough to face its majesty, and believe me nothing will prepare you enough either.\n\
  The charm of this place lies on different levels. For the ones who appreciate architecture,\
  \ it's the perfect complex to admire the typical Asian architecture. To the ones\
  \ who appreciate meditation and introspection, the Grand Palace offers you a sacred\
  \ Buddhist space, and finally to those who just like to get to know the country\
  \ by meeting its locals, despite the big number of tourists visiting it daily, they\
  \ will find as well a majority of locals admiring their history and who are ready\
  \ to engage with you in a conversation, with the ever existing Thai smile on their\
  \ faces.\nWearing appropriate clothes for a sacred place, I got in with the first\
  \ sun light. Was it fear or excitement I couldn't tell anymore but I was sure that\
  \ all of my senses were captivated. The eyes can not have one full panoramic view\
  \ of all the Palace from one point of view and the scenery of the Buddha statue\
  \ meditating can never be forgotten. The exotic beautiful smell of the candles burning\
  \ invited me to burn my own candle and I still remember the sound of the bell loud\
  \ and clear like it was yesterday.\nBut what I didn't expect to find was the happiness\
  \ I felt after the time spent with a Buddhist monk in the gardens. For a mediterranean\
  \ guy who just had his first glimpse of Asia I was totally taken by a small conversation\
  \ with the monk who, without getting into religions and books, just with the simplicity\
  \ and the smile gave me answers about life that I deeply needed it.\nThis spirtiual\
  \ morning cannot end without a taste of the delicious food cooked outside the Palace.\
  \ Greeting your host with a bow and the hands joined, you will taste the famous\
  \ Pad Thai.\nEventually, I can still pick the fruits of this first trip I did two\
  \ years ago, since it was so good that it gave me motivation to navigate the world\
  \ each time I can and to visit my tenth country last month. Thailand was my first\
  \ adventure away from home, two years ago was like yesterday. Therefor, for every\
  \ soon to be wanderer I advise you to make sure that your first trip is well planned."
