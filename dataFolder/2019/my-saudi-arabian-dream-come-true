Text: "Visiting Saudi Arabia as a tourist used to be nearly impossible. In January,\
  \ my partner and I were fortunate to be some of the first people to enter the country\
  \ on a tourist visa. \n\nWe impulsively applied for a \u2018special events visa\u2019\
  \ for the Italian Soccer Cup final which allowed us to enter KSA on a 30 day visa.\
  \ Three days later, we arrived in Jeddah in time for the football match, which had\
  \ such an incredible atmosphere. This was one of the first football matches that\
  \ women were allowed to attend.  The crowds were going crazy, and women were letting\
  \ their hair down, literally!\n\nThe following morning, we were contacted by a local\
  \ girl called Nada who had seen us post on social media. She was so happy we were\
  \ visiting KSA and asked to meet us, we instantly accepted the invitation. We were\
  \ keen to meet local people from KSA to find out how life really is in this country.\n\
  \ \nWe met in a traditional restaurant and had a great time chatting about her life\
  \ as a woman in Saudi.  We spent all day with Nada, it felt like we\u2019d known\
  \ her years. She is one of the most generous, open, and hospitable people we ever\
  \ met. The biggest takeaway for us after traveling in Saudi Arabia was that Nada\
  \ was not the exception. We had endless encounters with total strangers who invited\
  \ us for coffee or lunch. \n\nNada told us she had attended her first football match\
  \ the night before, and she had just received her driving licence. It's a very exciting\
  \ time to visit this country, with such dramatic positive changes happening fast.\
  \ \n\nWe had talked to Nada about our plans in KSA and how we really wanted to see\
  \ the archaeological site Madain Saleh.  Madain Saleh is a historical site in Al\
  \ Ula which was built by the Nabateans, the same tribe who built Petra in Jordan.\
  \  It is a UNESCO site with many fascinating tombs carved into giant rock formations\
  \ in the middle of the desert.  The problem was that it is currently closed to the\
  \ public for restorations.\n\nNada was immediately determined to help us get in\
  \ to see this historic masterpiece, so she pulled her phone out and started making\
  \ calls in Arabic. We didn't really know what was going on until she received a\
  \ call back and shrieked with excitement.  It turned out she had a friend who was\
  \ also a reputable tour guide in Al Ula and he could get us entry to Madain Saleh\
  \ on Saturday providing we could get to Al Ula the next day.  We gratefully accepted\
  \ the challenge and left early the next morning.\n\nWe arrived in Al Ula in total\
  \ darkness after an all day bus ride. We met Aziz briefly before heading to bed\
  \ for a few hours sleep. \n\n\nWe arrived at the ticket office early in the morning\
  \ with hopes of gaining entry. He explained that as a one off, the authorities were\
  \ granting 30 tickets for people to see the archaeological sites. \n\nRumour must\
  \ have spread as there were many locals waiting at the ticket office when we arrived.\
  \ Trying not to get disheartened, I started to doubt that we would get one of these\
  \ tickets. We didn't realise that our new friend and tour guide was well connected\
  \ in the area. Rather than standing in the queue, he headed around to the back door,\
  \ chatted to some people and came back out. \"All sorted\" he said, the bus was\
  \ there and we had tickets. We were over the moon.\n\nIt really was an incredible\
  \ sight to see and with no big crowds of people, or any other foreigners visiting,\
  \ it really did feel special. We were guided on a bus to four of the magnificent\
  \ sites. \n\nWe finished our day drinking Arabic coffee sitting on cushions on the\
  \ sand of the desert, surrounded by the incredible rock formations, with a traditional\
  \ band playing classical music. We sat there so content and enriched by the culture\
  \ surrounding us. This day is one we will never forget, and one that would have\
  \ never been possible without making our local connections and new friends."
