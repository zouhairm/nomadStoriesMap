Text: "Pack up your troubles and travel!\nI took some time out to travel last week,\
  \ For numerous reasons... one reason being I\u2019m always talking about my adventurous\
  \ nature, but from my walking you couldn\u2019t tell so i did it for the soul, another\
  \ reason being i had enough of my routine and daily encounters, I felt I wasn\u2019\
  t in the mental space to deal with it appropriately... so I took my physical self\
  \ to a place my mental  could organise and make new space for what I wanted to experience.\n\
  I traveled to a new city amsterdam centraal. Different from what I know, by myself\
  \ too! this may sound weird to some... but I now understand from reflecting I was\
  \ experiencing turmoil because I was ignoring the subtle voice within, I was abandoning\
  \ my intuition,  it is easy to become lost when you absorb so many energies around\
  \ you in daily life, work-wise, family etc.. I made myself lost by allowing this.\
  \ I would noticed ill decisions I was made and not acting on mental decisions, \
  \ leading me to a unhappy state wherevi would regret it almost instantly. I was\
  \ forgetting how to listen to myself. to rectify this I thought I would do the physical\
  \ to what I had done to myself spiritually, I physically made myself lost in a new\
  \ city where I had to trust my intuition and guidance (and google maps at times)\
  \ to lead me to where I needed to be.\nI started each day with a prayer of wanting\
  \ to experience something I never knew I would love, I also prayed for discernment\
  \ in my interactions with people, And that's what happened I experienced love, excitement,\
  \ and awe.\nA renewed trust in myself was established, I feel as if I have strengthened\
  \ my navigation again, reconnected with my moral compass and put myself in a state\
  \ where I can make healthy decisions.\nI also explored my inner working by taking\
  \ a bit of my passion with me, I took a camera and captured whatever made me stop\
  \ and stare. \nMy takeaway for all is that stepping back from your problems when\
  \ it gets to hazey is helpful as we're human and can be standing in your own ways,\
  \ but what defines the line between solitude and escaping from your problems like\
  \ a hermit crab, is coming back ready to tackle your issues with a refreshed, honest\
  \ and organised mind. \nAnother takeaway is \u201Cto trust yourself is to know yourself\u201D\
  , if you make decisions you don\u2019t like take the time to observe why and understand\
  \ what your soul is asking of you! If not, not only will you not trust yourself...you\
  \ may end up submitting your will to energies that have nothing to do with you and\
  \ denying your God-given right to do what is in your best interest and what makes\
  \ you happy.\n\nPeace and blessings!!"
