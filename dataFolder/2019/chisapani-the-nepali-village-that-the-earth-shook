Text: "After an hour or so on a rickety old bus, we had traded the bustling streets\
  \ of Kathmandu for the cinnamon-scented forest of Sundarijal. My guide Subash had\
  \ not said a word\u2013largely due to the fact that he had fallen asleep. \n\n\u201C\
  Sherpas sleep when we can,\u201D he said now stirring as if I had spoken out loud.\n\
  \nAs he rose, his eyes glowed with the intensity of a lion. \n\n\u201CThis way,\u201D\
  \ he motioned and started off up the path.\n\nIn mere minutes, the dense forest\
  \ of rhododendrons and brown oak gave way to a clearing, and in the center of it,\
  \ a waterfall. \n\nHow disconcertingly peaceful. I had already pictured today\u2019\
  s hike, but not like this: sat on a plane bound for Kathmandu, my mind had raced\
  \ ahead to Himalayan peaks slicing the horizon like jagged dragon\u2019s teeth.\
  \ As we whizzed through the darkness my thoughts had been interrupted by a violent\
  \ lightning storm. Each strike allowed me to glean my neighbor's anxious expressions.\
  \ \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s cross the river,\u201D Subash called, bringing me out of\
  \ my thoughts. \n\nThe higher we got up the trail, the more people we saw moving\
  \ building blocks and carrying rubble down in sacks made of fabric.\n\nSubash called\
  \ out to one of the men. After a brief exchange, he looked over to me.\n\n\u201C\
  What did the man say?\u201D I asked\n\n\u201CThe government promised to offer him\
  \ credits for rebuilding houses. That was two years ago. Now, people have started\
  \ to rebuild on their own.\u201D\n\nAfter around two hours trekking ever upwards\
  \ we spied our destination: Chisapani\u2013a small village devastated by the earthquake\
  \ of 2015. But as we finally crested the hill, it was not the ground that trembled\
  \ but my legs. The scene of devastation moved me to tears. Rubble stood in place\
  \ of houses. And the houses that still stood were tilted at jarring angles.\n\n\
  And yet children played: Kids of seven and eight were riding motorbikes; the women\u2013\
  Didis\u2013 were washing clothes. Life here seemed to carry on peacefully.\n\nWe\
  \ had arrived at dusk. \n\n\u201CWe\u2019ll sleep here tonight. I know a place,\u201D\
  \ Subash called out and made off what seemed to be one of the only unaffected houses.\
  \ The owner greeted Subash warmly. As we paid for the room the spritely old man\
  \ offered Subash a bottle of clear liquor.\n\n\u201CMy grandfather\u201D Subash\
  \ explained.\n\n\u201CWhat is that drink, Subash?\u201D\n\n\u201CRaksi - rice liquor.\
  \ You know Saki? It\u2019s like that but cleaner. If its good quality, you  don\u2019\
  t get a hangover.\u201D\n\n\u201CAnd how do you tell if it is - good quality, that\
  \ is?\u201D\n\n\u201CYou drink it,\u201D Subash replied with a grin. \n\nWe climbed\
  \ the concrete stairs and stepped out onto the rooftop. There, on the horizon, I\
  \ was humbled by the greatest mountain range on the planet, the Himalayas\u2013\
  land of the snow. \n\nWe sat on two makeshift deckchairs and marveled at the snow-capped\
  \ peaks stretching into the clouds.\n\n\u201CSubhakamana!\u201D Subash exclaimed\
  \ as we clinked glasses.\n\n\u201CCheers\u201D I said gulping my Raksi like mouthwash.\n\
  \nThe Raksi tasted of almost nothing. \n\nAfter some idle conversation, Subash turned\
  \ to me and asked: \u201CDo you have a girlfriend?\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019m working\
  \ on it!\u201D I replied\n\n\u201CYou know, I am married. But my wife is from a\
  \ different caste. She is from the lower caste. It means we can't eat together.\
  \ Our families don\u2019t accept the union\u2026\u201D\n\nBefore Subash could finish\
  \ his sentence,  a storm had closed in and Subash\u2019s expression changed. A vertical\
  \ wall of bruised storm clouds spanned the horizon.\n\n\u201CMonsoon season is starting,\
  \ let\u2019s get inside\u201D Subash said.\n\nNo sooner had we headed down to our\
  \ room and closed the door than the rain hit. It hammered on the tin roof like machine-gun\
  \ rounds.\n\nA lightning strike lit up the room and took out the electricity to\
  \ the whole village. As we lay there in the darkness, the rain hammered, and although\
  \ we had only just met, I felt strangely close to Subash. The power of Mother Nature\
  \ raging outside had somehow brought us closer together without saying another word."
