Text: "Goa - this coastal paradise in western India attracts a huge number of tourists\
  \ from far and near every year, in fact, around ten times its own population. \n\
  Its lush greenery, golden beaches, beautiful architecture and rich cuisine have\
  \ always drawn people who have succumbed to its charms.  My family and I, too, have\
  \ been no exception.\nFlying to Goa was the usual journey, as we packed our bags\
  \ and made our way through the crowd at Kolkata airport, and then landed at Goa\u2019\
  s lone air connection at Dabolim. Our drive to the hotel saw us transported into\
  \ another world of neatly-maintained quaint coastal villages, Portuguese-style Catholic\
  \ churches and numerous little temples dedicated to Durga and Laxmi as we drove\
  \ past.\nUnlike most of India, Goa attained its independence in 1961. That is the\
  \ reason, Goa continues with its colonial hangover until recent times. This is overtly\
  \ manifest in north Goa, and especially in the capital, Panjim. Not only do most\
  \ inhabitants here profess Portuguese-style Roman Catholicism, official government\
  \ buildings remind you of the days when Goa continued to be ruled by its Portuguese\
  \ gentry. This may have a lot to do with the fact that the European colonialists\
  \ conquered and ruled Goa from the 15th century until the mid-20th century, too,\
  \ which adds up to 500 years, as compared to just around 150-200 years of rule in\
  \ other parts of the country. Cruel and barbaric, the Portuguese are known to have\
  \ massacred thousands to convert them into Christianity wherever they ruled. Conversion\
  \ was followed by strong repression to have people move away from their native practices\
  \ and adopt European culture, culinary habits, and lifestyle. Thus, to this day,\
  \ Goan Christians are a class apart, with their lifestyle and cuisine hardly having\
  \ any resemblense to what is the norm among other Indians. \nIn fact, a Goan Christian\
  \ differs strongly from his Hindu counterpart, who generally hails from south Goa,\
  \ which continued to be ruled by Hindu kings until much later. But all Goans share\
  \ a great love for drink. A glass of beer, port wine, or the local feni is standard\
  \ fare with dinner or lunch.\nThis itself makes Goa an eclectic mix of cultures.\
  \ Even as places like Ponda boasts of Hindu Shaktipeeths, with huge temple complexes\
  \ manifested in the Shantadurga or Mahalasa temples, Old Goa and Panjim abound in\
  \ delightful edifices such as the Se Cathedral and Bom Jesus Basilica.\nThe Goan\
  \ Hindu cuisine is inspired by the Konkani Saraswat Brahmin palate, while the Goan\
  \ Christian cuisine boasts of having been inspired by Portuguese, African and South\
  \ American flavours. Thus, we have the Portuguese -inspired Chicken/Pork vindaloo,\
  \ pork sorpotel, and the Prawn Balchao, besides sweets like the layered Bebinca\
  \ and local coconut milk and jaggery-mixed dodol.\nWe were lucky to witness Goa\u2019\
  s 4-day carnival, which begins from the Panjim city beach of Miramar and travels\
  \ to Donna Paula, and is a carryover of Portuguese revelry unique to Goa. The only\
  \ other place you can view the carnival is Brazil-in South America. A time of revelry,\
  \ the carnival is when Goans clean up their kitchens, and eat out. Eateries all\
  \ over Goa, hence, are kept open night and day. Floats made of oversized masks,\
  \ folk dances like mando and tiatr plays mark the carnival processions, with King\
  \ Momo and his queen leading it. King Momo is a person selected from among local\
  \ performing artistes, and the position is much coveted by all. While the first\
  \ Carnival procession begins in Panjim and winds its way to Donna Paula, the following\
  \ processions are held in other cities of Goa. \nOf late, this traditional  Carnival\
  \ is being used to put forth social messages, and campaign for change.\nIncidentally,\
  \ Goa is the only place in India where gambling is legal. Come evening, and the\
  \ Panjim riverfront is full of bright neon signs beckoning one and all into casinos\
  \ for a spin of the roulette wheel. However, our visit to a casino revealed no local\
  \ faces. The  fact that  the casinos came up in the face of strong local opposition\
  \ was more than evident.  Yet, these thrive during the tourist season; settling\
  \ down to a languid pace during the lean months every year."
