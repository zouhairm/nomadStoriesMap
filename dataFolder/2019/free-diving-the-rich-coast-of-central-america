Text: "Standing on a boat off of the coast of Central America, is a dramatic reversal\
  \ from life as I knew it, having been raised on the edge of the frigid North Atlantic\
  \ ocean.  \nAlthough I couldn\u2019t curb my wild heart from pumping excitement\
  \ through my veins, my diaphragm steadily stretched and compressed my lungs. \n\
  Slowly. Deeply.\nWe stood on the edge of another world, unencumbered by oxygen tanks,\
  \ vests, and regulators from our previous training. Nothing but fins, a mask, a\
  \ snorkel, and ourselves.\nRhythmic breathing and unwavering mind, I took my last\
  \ breath for the next three minutes and dove beneath the waves.\n\nTime stood still.\n\
  \nOnly the sound of my own heartbeat reminded me of the current of time passing\
  \ above.\n\nOne hundred, eighty seconds.\n\nAn underwater garden danced before my\
  \ eyes, swaying with the currents of the sea. I took in towering stone formations,\
  \ delicate sponges, and an assortment of flora I\u2019d only seen the like of in\
  \ fairytales with mermaids and sea-witches.\n\nOne hundred, twenty seconds.\n\n\
  I sank lower and lay back, looking up through the veil of saltwater, and saw the\
  \ blurred figures of the sun and the clouds in the pale blue sky. An image of a\
  \ world away. \nMy lungs grew impatient, while my heart was set free, wondering\
  \ if this is what it feels like to fly. \nSpace above me, nothing below me. Weightless.\
  \ Serene.\n\nSixty seconds.\n\nI introduce myself to some delightful characters;\
  \ the spiky blowfish, the rainbow parrotfish, and yellowtail damselfish who swim\
  \ merrily about, while the spiny sea urchins and grey angelfish keep to themselves.\n\
  \nFifty seconds.\n\nI spot the anchor and the hull of our boat. Seemingly out of\
  \ place in this otherworldly space. \nMaking note of fellow divers about me, I drift\
  \ upward. Able only to rise as quickly as the bubbles that accent the steady swish\
  \ of my flippers. \n\nForty seconds.\n\nAs common as stray cats; a small, disinterested\
  \ white-tipped reef shark glides across the sandy ocean floor.\n\nThirty seconds.\n\
  \nBubbles burst from me!\nI spot a treasure that to me, is greater than gold. \n\
  A young sea turtle. \n\nTwenty seconds.\n\nI wish I could stay longer.\n\nTen seconds.\n\
  \nI wish I could stay forever.\n\nFive seconds.\n\nI breach the surface. Fresh air\
  \ fills my lungs with relief. \nMy time has run dry, but my spirit is overflowing."
