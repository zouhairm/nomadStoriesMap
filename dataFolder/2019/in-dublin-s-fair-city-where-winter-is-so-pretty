Text: "In Dublin's Fair City, Where Winter Is So Pretty\u2026\n\nI first laid my eyes,\
  \ on a snow-covered Molly Malone statue.  A snowstorm hit Dublin and the Emerald\
  \ Isle in late winter of 2018.  Although the ancient city is best-known for its\
  \ tourist-filled streets and the best craic in its countless pubs, many tourists\
  \ only think of Dublin for its iconic symbols, the leprechaun, the shamrock, and\
  \ the Temple Bar. However, Dublin has a secret, one of self-discovery if a tourist\
  \ knows where to look.  \n\nI went to Ireland with an expectation unknown even to\
  \ myself. What I found was beyond anything I could have imagined. As a budding author,\
  \ I was looking for validation for my degree in Creative Writing because so many\
  \ people commented it wasn\u2019t sensible; it didn\u2019t offer stability. By gifting\
  \ myself the trip, I discovered I don't need anyone\u2019s affirmation to accomplish\
  \ my goals. I needed to walk the streets and touch the magic for myself.\nThe empty\
  \ streets looked forlorn to the eye of a wandering tourist who didn\u2019t know\
  \ where to go.  Perhaps what felt so forlorn was the loneliness I felt inside, but\
  \ Dublin is a city that rejects the idea that any tourist isn\u2019t welcome. Warm\
  \ hospitality can be found through the various establishments, but the biggest question\
  \ I faced as I warred within myself was, where do I fit in?\n\nTucked away in the\
  \ corner of one of Dublin's many cobblestoned streets, is the Molly Malone statue.\
  \  Although the story within the song, \u2018In Dublin's Fair City\u2019 portrays\
  \ the life of a young peddler woman, the song and the statue represent more than\
  \ the toils of a woman of the 17th century.  The unofficial anthem has been adopted\
  \ and is a representation of Dublin's air of magic. Like Molly, I discovered the\
  \ person I was peddling my wares to was myself. \n\nMy next stop was the Library\
  \ at Trinity College.  Better known as The Long Room, where anyone captivated by\
  \ literature, finds breath-taking rows of books lining the shelves. To get to The\
  \ Long Room, tourists traverse the antechamber, where the Book of Kells, a 9th century\
  \ illuminated manuscript, is on display. A respectful ambiance rests over the viewing\
  \ case. It was here, I learned to respect the dedication it would take to develop\
  \ my craft. \n\nA short taxi-ride across the River Liffey found me standing in front\
  \ of an 18th Century house at the Dublin Writer's Museum.  With its quiet reverie,\
  \ the museum was the connection I needed to appreciate the literary works of Dublin's\
  \ W. B. Yeats, Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw, and James Joyce. Their words resonated\
  \ in the past and will live on to affect literature of the present and future.\n\
  \nNeeding some adventure, I decided to explore Dublin Castle. Built in the 13th\
  \ century, the castle was destroyed by fire, but parts of a Viking Settlement were\
  \ built on top of it. A little-known fact about the castle is that Bram Stoker,\
  \ the author of Dracula worked at the castle in the late 1800s.  What better place\
  \ to nip into a bit of the mystique that pulses through the veins of Temple Bar\u2019\
  s many streets?\n\nI furthered my exploration at the National Museum of Archaeology.\
  \ The museum was a reminder that for centuries, people have struggled with survival,\
  \ life, and the necessity of leaving one\u2019s imprint on the world to be remembered.\
  \ From Prehistoric to Medieval Ireland, and even the building itself, an architectural\
  \ relic of the 1800\u2019s, the artefacts encased within the glass cases, commemorate\
  \ those people.\n\nTourists who venture to the city might wonder what these places\
  \ have in common. The answer was so simple. The imprint of the people upon Dublin\
  \ is as vibrant and alive from the past, as it is with the people who crowd the\
  \ streets today. The allure of the city is deeply seeded in the energy of the souls\
  \ who have found wonder and amazement there, and humanity\u2019s collective energy\
  \ lends credence to the idea that Dublin is full of magic. Having discovered that\
  \ dreams do come true, I cherish having touched the magic at the end of the country\u2019\
  s rainbow, in the pot of gold, Dublin, Ireland."
