Text: "Two years ago I had the opportunity to be in the Conference in Paris. It was\
  \ 13th May 2017. That night I watched The Eurovision Song Contest 2017 live from\
  \ my hotel room. It was my first time watching it live from television. As an Indonesian\
  \ fan for more than 6 years, I can watch it only from Youtube a day after it was\
  \ aired, because Europe is so far away from my home in Indonesia. So that time,\
  \ I couldn't help my self to yell together with the audience in the venue from my\
  \ hotel room.\n\nAfter that night, I was inspired to search the same opportunity\
  \ to go to Europe again and this time it was the Netherlands. So from 16th March\
  \ to 23rd May I had imternship in the Municipality of Rotterdam. Since the beginning\
  \ of the programme, I already promised myself to attend the Eurovision in Concert\
  \ 2018 in Amsterdam,  one of the opening concert of the Eurovision Song Contest\
  \ 2018. Portugal was the winner of Eurovision Song Contest 2017, thus it would be\
  \ the host 0f 2018. I knew it was quite impossible to go to Lisbon, so I chose the\
  \ opening one in Amsterdam.\n\nBut then it was always haunting my mind, therefore\
  \ I finally bought ticket to Lisbon and planned to be there at 7th May 2018. Unfortunately\
  \ my mentors said that on that day we would have a class for all the internship.\
  \ With a sad heart I need to cancel everything to watch the Eurovision. It made\
  \ even got sick and fever. \n\nOn the second day I was ill, it was 8th May 2018,\
  \ I don't know why when I opened the Eurovision website, they still selling the\
  \ ticket for Live Performance of 2nd Semi Final on 10th May and Jury Performance\
  \ of Grand Final on 11th May. After I got a courage from my sister, I finally decided\
  \ to buy both of the tickets, bought the hotel's room and bought the plane ticket\
  \ from Amsterdam to Lisbon. Unfortunately ticket back from Lisbon to Amsterdam was\
  \ so expensive, while I need to be in my dormitory on 12th night so I could watched\
  \ Grand Final live from television. So I chose to flight back to Brussels first\
  \ instead of Amsterdam, then bought bus ticket to Rotterdam where my dormitory was.\n\
  \nSo, I finally went to Lisbon on 10th May morning. It was my first time traveling\
  \ alone and I was still sick back then. I packed up my medicine, brought food supply\
  \ I need so I would not feel hungry. Fortunately after I arrive there I was trying\
  \ to make my self stronger and what was so lucky to me when I was in the hostel\
  \ room I met a new friend, a solo traveler also, who want to watch the Eurovision.\
  \ She is from America, a long way to Lisbon just like me! \n\nAfter met her in our\
  \ room, and we introduced each other, we promised to travel together in the next\
  \ day, as that night I need to attend the live performance of semi final 2  while\
  \ she had only ticket for jury performance of grand final which I also had the ticket.\
  \ \n\nIt was a great day! We took the walking tour to Alfama, part of Lisbon city.\
  \ We took a lot of photos and thanks to her, she was there as my photographer. She\
  \ was a good one! We even took a ride of an old elevator of Lisbon because we know\
  \ it was so famous. Our journey really made me fall in love with Lisbon and I really\
  \ want to be there again. \n\nIt was my first time that I gained so much confidence\
  \ to traveling by myself, to meet someone I never knew before, to attend an event\
  \ I always dreamt about. I promise I will back to Portugal again and enjoying more\
  \ all the beautiful parts of the country. Right now I already back in my home in\
  \ Indonesia. Eventhough this year I will watched the contest from my house, the\
  \ journey to Lisbon because of Eurovision Song Contest still be the best journey\
  \ I ever had."
