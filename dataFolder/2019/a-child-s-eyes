Text: "\"Sawadee ka,\" she shouted, with a bright smile washed across her filthy,\
  \ yet youthful skin. I returned greetings with my rough and trying Thai speech,\
  \ which still differs from her remote village dialect. \"I\u2019m a teacher,\" I\
  \ say, \"in a place called Canada. I teach children just like you.\" Her eyes widen\
  \ and sadden simultaneously. \"No school here for us,\" she speaks in her broken\
  \ English, \"but my brother learns me words when come home.\" I hand her a box of\
  \ crayolas with names of colors she cannot read \u2013 mahogany, burnt orange, sunglow,\
  \ jungle green, hot magenta and cerulean. Strikingly similar to the hues of the\
  \ Chaing Rai sky, lush canopy trees and blue waters, as if I could pencil them in\
  \ right around us. \n\nShe teaches me how to make priceless toys, play with sticks,\
  \ Lahu dance, peel unfamiliar fruits so I don\u2019t look silly and how to make\
  \ ample rice dishes, penetrated with spices. We spend the days singing and dancing,\
  \ eating and coloring, sharing and learning from each other. \n\nWhile telling stories\
  \ and eating rambutan on the earthen floor of her family\u2019s single, bamboo cabin,\
  \ she assaults my long blonde hair with her sticky fingers. I don\u2019t mind because\
  \ I now know showers are a luxury. I\u2019ll wash it out at the hill-tribes favored\
  \ waterfall down the way.  We slurp the juices between words and glances, throwing\
  \ the scraps to the strays and swine that scavenge for leavings at the entrance.\
  \ \n\nWhen it\u2019s time for me to go, she hands me a bracelet, with colorful beads\
  \ and little silver elephants that dangle as I move. \"Gui,\" I ask, \"why are you\
  \ giving me this?\" I think of how little she has. \"I don\u2019t need, don't need\
  \ it,\" she stutters. The difference between a need and a want punches me in the\
  \ gut. She has never lived with extras. I try to force 500 baht into her mother\u2019\
  s calloused hands, as if money is the answer to everything. They would not take\
  \ it. \"Kob Khun Kha,\" I utter and that is enough. \n\nPlaced around my wrist,\
  \ I suddenly became thankful for my feet to jump in puddles left behind from monsoon\
  \ rains, my hands to play with stick swords, my imagination to look beyond clouds,\
  \ my eyes to see the colors, my ears to listen to stories, my mouth to taste the\
  \ spices, my nose to smell the aromas \u2013 to feel immensely grateful, through\
  \ a child\u2019s eyes, on the other side of the world. \n\nOnce back home, I gather\
  \ my students as they unknowingly take advantage of our four walls and fancy new\
  \ classroom Chromebooks. A seven-year-old fingers my bracelet and asks me where\
  \ it\u2019s from. I tell her. \"It\u2019s so pretty,\" she says and asks, \"are\
  \ they rich?\" like children do when they see shiny, new things. I nod, \"Yes, they\u2019\
  re much richer than us. They see the world through different eyes.\""
