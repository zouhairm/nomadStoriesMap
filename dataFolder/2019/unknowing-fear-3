Text: "I was too afraid to leave the room as I was not entirely sure what reception\
  \ I would receive on the other side of the door. I spent the evening wandering the\
  \ streets of El Jadida Morocco alone with a 72 year old man. We sat under the moon\
  \ looking out at the Atlantic Ocean, shared dinner together, without a word, given\
  \ we could not communicate. We arrived back at home at 2:12a.m. I prepared to go\
  \ to bed and as I was sitting on the bed I heard a woman howling, numerous footsteps\
  \ towards the front door, a car door slam and drive away. Just seconds after the\
  \ car sped off, the door creaked open and without seeing exactly who it was, a man's\
  \ voice said, \u201CAbu...dead...no worry.\u201D He closed the door and left me\
  \ alone to my thoughts. My only real thought was, \u201CI am not only the white\
  \ man here, but the last man to have been with him alive.\u201D \nI spent the night\
  \ thinking of reliving the Midnight Express plot. I weeped pools into the pillows,\
  \ I paced the tiny room which happened to be the bedroom of Abu. Not only would\
  \ others think I took his life, but I took his bedroom in the process. Each time\
  \ the light would flicker under the door I was struck with fear, thinking that the\
  \ moment someone would take me to my doom would come. It never did, however the\
  \ urge to pee escalated. \n\tOn the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, at my home\
  \ in Brooklyn, New York is where I first made a Moroccan connection. After being\
  \ sponsored to attend a two week women's leadership camp in Vermont, Hind, the daughter\
  \ of Abu, arrived at my home via friends of the organizers. She initially was going\
  \ to stay for a month. After that month she asked to stay forever. Without hesitation,\
  \ over the coming years my parents took her in, sponsored her immigration, helped\
  \ find her find work and even acted as her parents at her wedding. She became family.\
  \ Due to the fact I was studying in Europe, I went to visit my \u2018extended family,\u2019\
  \ but did not expect myself to be in a room hiding for what I thought was my life.\
  \ \nEventually, my biological urges forced me out of the room. As I opened the door\
  \ I felt the eyes staring at me. There were four women in black hijabs, fully covered\
  \ except for their eyes. They did not speak, but stared at me. I ran to the bathroom\
  \ and I heard whispers in Arabic. I knew there was no more prolonging what would\
  \ happen so I exited the bathroom ready to see what I would find. \n There were\
  \ no less than 50 woman in a small room that should only fit five, all staring at\
  \ me. All of them were covered except for their eyes. Starting to tear up, out of\
  \ both fear and the overwhelming feeling of having no idea what is nor what is about\
  \ to happen, I whelped for the sister of Hind, the other daughter of Abu. One woman\
  \ took my hand and pulled me outside with no shoes and sat me on a plastic chair.\
  \ I sat there crying and felt cold even though it was nearly 100 degrees. A few\
  \ minutes of sitting alone, weeping I felt a hand on my shoulder. I looking up and\
  \ saw Safa. She pulled me up and hugged me. She started to sob and wail and I copied.\
  \ I felt her pain, and holding her I thought not about what would happen to me but\
  \ what she was going through. Having lost her father, becoming the oldest child\
  \ that must now take care of the ailing mother. I thought of the burden that was\
  \ on her. Her hug sent the message to me I did not cause her pain. \nI realized\
  \ that when you travel, whether to visit someone or not, life doesn't stop. We often\
  \ think of vacations and traveling as transporting away from our lives but life\
  \ stops for no one. We enter different peoples lives when we travel, and sometimes\
  \ the end of it for others."
