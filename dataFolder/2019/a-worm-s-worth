Text: "Once I said to myself that all religions were hypocritical, but later it proved\
  \ I were wrong.\n   Last summer my friend invited me to visit the biggest Buddha\
  \ temple in China together. At first my mind totally refused this but finally our\
  \ close relationship got the upper hand, pushing me to accompany him in this trip.\n\
  \   It took us dozens of hours to reach the city where the temple was located. As\
  \ soon as we got off the train, our first thought was to find the temple and have\
  \ a rest, because the sizzling summer temperature really tortured me a lot. Even\
  \ on the bus with air-conditioner, the hot wave still haunted me like a homeless\
  \ ghost, driving me anxious like an ant on the hot pot, whereas most people around\
  \ me remained still like a statue without any signs of disquiet. My friend told\
  \ me it\u2019s because they all had an inch of clean land in their mind which cooled\
  \ them down. I was confused. Did Buddhists equip themselves with an air-conditioner\
  \ at the bottom of their heart? Really strange!\n   A 45-minute ride threw us into\
  \ the ancient temple, lying gracefully in the suburb of the city. All the monks\
  \ were doing their own business but when we came close, they still stopped for a\
  \ while and cast a flashing smile on us, soothing my anxiety a lot. Yet the doubt\
  \ towards the religion was still deeply rooted in my mind reminding me that all\
  \ believers were liars. Till the night I always kept an eye on my belongings and\
  \ stayed with my friend\u2019s side. On the bed I still murmured to him that we\
  \ had to watch out for these monks. \n   For fear of the monks, I didn\u2019t sleep\
  \ well last night and woke up early at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning. Unwilling\
  \ to bother my friends and other visitors, I put on my clothes and took a walk in\
  \ the temple alone. The whole temple still nestled in the arms of the tranquility\
  \ and darkness, with only dimming fire flickering in the lantern. I hummed to myself\
  \ all the way and tried to have some fun in the temple. When it came to a tree,\
  \ there was something wrong. That tree seemed very similar to the one I just encountered\
  \ several minutes ago. Without a second thought it occurred to me I lost my way.\
  \ With a shrug, I still walked freely, hoping that after several hours when it\u2019\
  s getting lighter, someone may find me. When I turned to another road, a monk appeared\
  \ in front of me several yards away. Suddenly he stopped, stooped down, picked up\
  \ a small stick on the ground and then put something with the stick on the grass\
  \ besides the road. He saw me and asked why I wandered here alone. After explaining\
  \ the reason, he sent me to the dormitory. When going by where he had just stooped\
  \ down, I saw from the corner of eyes a worm crawling away on the grass.\n   Seeing\
  \ is believing. Legends have it that Buddhists will never kill a being, even if\
  \ an ant on the street will receive their love. I used to think it\u2019s a lie,\
  \ for no one would care too much about such a little being; whereas my eyes told\
  \ me it\u2019s true. Even a worm has its own worth."
