Text: "Love is a catalyst. It makes things happen.  \n\nWhen I meet people living\
  \ away from where they were born, I ask.\n\n\u2018What brings you here?\u2019 But\
  \ the answer takes a while to expose, and is always the same, so I\u2019ve started\
  \ to ask, \u2018Did love bring you here or was it work?\u2019 \n\nBecause that\u2019\
  s always the eventual outcome.\n\nOnce they\u2019ve answered, I ask,\n\n\u2018And\
  \ what made you stay, was that love\u2026. or work?\u2019\n\nI ask it nicely, of\
  \ course, and make it sound\u2026.. unrehearsed. As if they\u2019re the only person\
  \ I\u2019ve ever asked.\n\nThe motivation for an adventure, a risk, a journey\u2026\
  is crucial. A constant source of fascination to me.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting the\
  \ answer I got from a Yorkshireman I met in Scotland. \n\n\u2018I drove husky teams\
  \ at the South Pole and brought a puppy home with me. This was the only place he\
  \ could live.\u2019\n\nThe South Pole is not a casual destination. Neither is it\
  \ cheap. It is not an undertaking entered into lightly: you can\u2019t go, dislike\
  \ it and decide to move on. Winter holds you there. For months.\n\nSome adventures\
  \ demand a commitment before you go, rather than once you get there. \n\nWhen John\
  \ was young, in the 1960s, Europe was still an exotic destination. For most people\
  \ travel was exclusively about holidays, confined to a couple of weeks a year, predominantly\
  \ in the UK, sometimes \u2018on the continent\u2019.\n\nTravel that involved exploration\
  \ was for the very wealthy: rich in money and in time. Flights were expensive and\
  \ infrequent.  Health care was of a much lower standard outside the western world\
  \ and costly: in money and potentially in outcome. Communications? \u2026.. the\
  \ charge for an international telephone call was exorbitant, the postal service\
  \ unreliable.\n\nFor a young man of modest means at that time it was difficult to\
  \ travel for the joy of the adventure.  Possibilities existed: the army, the Foreign\
  \ Office, the British Council\u2026\u2026 \n\nJohn became a journalist, success\
  \ in the UK might bring about an international posting.  However, after covering\
  \ the Moors Murders for the local paper he decided the route to Foreign Correspondent\
  \ was not only slow but provided a challenge potentially too harrowing for a young\
  \ man full of the joy of being alive.\n\nWith a geography degree and a short period\
  \ in local newspapers John managed to secure a job with National Geographic, mapping\
  \ ice ranges in the South Pole.  He travelled by air to Argentina and then by ship\
  \ for a two-year posting, men only. John decided to take the opportunity of the\
  \ long period of isolation to give up smoking.  He didn\u2019t manage it and ended\
  \ up smoking colleague\u2019s dog ends in toilet paper. \n\nJohn and I talked, I\
  \ was hungry for accounts of his experiences. He told me stories of seas of blood:\
  \ naive penguins slaughtered in their hundreds when men reached the end of their\
  \ ocean voyages on beaches crowded with the trusting birds. Tales of racing sledges\
  \ naked over the snow during the long days of sunshine, of biting the ears of the\
  \ huskies because no thrashing got through to them. At some particularly needy moment,\
  \ in response to a heartfelt plea, a military aeroplane dropped a crate of Mars\
  \ Bars to them.  One long winter, with the help of a voice on the radio, John extracted\
  \ the tooth of a colleague maddened by pain.\n\nThe South Pole is remote. In the\
  \ winter there is no help. The wind whistles, unchecked, across the white wilderness.\
  \ The ice moves, slowly, creepily, creaking as it does so. A side of beef John\u2019\
  s team brought and buried in the ice when they landed wasn\u2019t there when they\
  \ returned to dig it out for Christmas lunch.\n\nI tried to make John\u2019s experience\
  \ fit my paradigm, I convinced myself it was love for the husky puppy that brought\
  \ him to the Highlands. The husky puppy didn\u2019t survive. A whisker from a wolf.\
  \ It killed so many sheep John had to have it put down before it was shot. \n\n\
  So if it was love that brought him to Scotland, it\u2019s been work that\u2019s\
  \ kept him here, polishing glasses and telling stories in a cosy bar to a traveller\
  \ hungry for adventure"
