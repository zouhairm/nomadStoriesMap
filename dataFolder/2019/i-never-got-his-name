Text: "I never got his name. I know his wife\u2019s name: Audrey, with an accent.\
  \ But not his.\nHis face is a spiderweb of wrinkles hanging around all his most\
  \ prominent features: eyes, mouth, nose. His eyebrows are bushy and messy and make\
  \ him look like he knows what he is doing. He spent a lot of time on cruises, he\
  \ says, and I can\u2019t help but see a retired pirate in him, hiding his hook under\
  \ a perfectly ironed cuff.\nHe is the one that started talking, I was just waiting.\n\
  Alone, I was waiting for a particular time of the day: the Eiffel Tower belongs\
  \ in front of a pink sky. When you see the triangular shape standing straight and\
  \ black in front of the Parisian sunset, it looks so perfectly fitting it seems\
  \ impossible to think the city could exist in any other shade of daylight. The problem\
  \ is, it does. That\u2019s why I was waiting, that\u2019s why I was bored, and that\u2019\
  s why I started.\nI was just itching to find something to do. I got out my notebook\
  \ and a bitten pencil and started sketching the mixture of iron and sky I was seeing\
  \ before me. It doesn\u2019t matter how many times you see the Eiffel Tower, how\
  \ many movies or postcards, you\u2019ll never know the exact number of rhombus shapes\
  \ in the structure until you attempt to put it on paper. My hands were moving repetitively,\
  \ tracing the same line over and over, to give the wobbly triangle on my page the\
  \ look of a distracted masterpiece.\n\"Are you an artist?\", he says.\nThat\u2019\
  s when he starts talking.\nI turn to face him, this old man that looks like a cigar\
  \ you could find in a mahogany box. His \u2018r\u2019s do summersaults, so I can\
  \ tell he\u2019s French. And he obviously can tell I\u2019m not.\n\"I\u2019m just\
  \ sketching\".\nI stand a little taller. Me, the exotic artist sketching the Eiffel\
  \ Tower in Paris, that\u2019s who I am.\nHe bends his head towards the page. I let\
  \ it hang there, exposed.\n\"I\u2019m a watercolor artist\", his French tobacco\
  \ voice informs me.\nI retract my excuse for a sketch like I just got burnt. I feel\
  \ like a little girl caught wearing her mother\u2019s shoes.\n\"That\u2019s interesting\"\
  , I try to not sound whiney. Suddenly the marble bench seems incredibly cold.\n\"\
  Where are you from, my darling?\"\n\"Italy\"\n\"We have lived in Italy for years!\"\
  , he screams as he has just found his long-lost daughter.\nI find out \u2018we\u2019\
  \ stands for him and his wife. The so-called Audrey, with an accent. To my understanding,\
  \ he added the accent.\nShe was a professional opera singer. \"She\u2019s retired,\
  \ not dead\", he specifies. \"American\", he adds, raising his eyebrows. There\u2019\
  s a secret meaning I\u2019m not getting.\nHe followed her around Italy for years\
  \ \u2013 he uses that word, following-, between green dresses and theatres, listening\
  \ to her belting as loud as she could in a language she didn\u2019t know. \"You\
  \ guys make some good cheese, I\u2019ll give you that. But the wine, nothing beats\
  \ French wine\". \nIt took her 12 years to retire. Years he spent sketching and\
  \ painting every single Italian face under the sun.\nThen, they could finally \u2013\
  \ he uses that word, finally \u2013 move back to Paris. \"I didn\u2019t get it at\
  \ first, why she liked this city so much. She was from the country of cowboys! But\
  \ every time we left it was like sprinkling salt over a wound I didn\u2019t know\
  \ I had. I was missing it every day\".\n\"I\u2019m so happy I left\", he continues.\
  \ \"Now Paris looks so young and fresh. Love is a great thing, kid, but nothing\
  \ compares to falling all over again for something you know like the back of your\
  \ hand\".\nHe stands up and I notice he\u2019s wearing shorts. It\u2019s spring,\
  \ after all.\n\"You keep doing that, but make sure to check the perspective\".\n\
  He puts his hands in his pockets and leaves, with the sun, right as the sky starts\
  \ turning pink.\nHe was Parisian, a watercolor artist and was married to an American\
  \ opera singer called Audrey, without an accent.\nBut I never got his name."
