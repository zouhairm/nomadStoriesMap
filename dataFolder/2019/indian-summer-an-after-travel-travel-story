Text: "I left a year ago, after\_my\_car was T-boned and burst into flames\u2014followed\
  \ by\_my\_relationship. I escaped both just in time. Moving out of the house didn't\
  \ seem far enough, so I went to India. For six months, I coursed from hot city streets\
  \ to cool mountains and down to the southern tip of the heart-shaped subcontinent,\
  \ where three seas converge.\n\_\nBut the tides eventually washed me back, my visa\
  \ expired, and tonight I'm at\_Beulah Land. It's the biblical paradise found by\
  \ the Jews, returning from exile in Babylon. It's also the name of this bar in Portland,\
  \ Oregon, USA. On the smoking patio, there's a brick wall with countless scrolls\
  \ of paper the size of pencil erasers, stuffed between the mortar cracks. It seems\
  \ sacrilegious to pluck them out and read them, but I can't resist: handwritten\
  \ notes to unrequited loves, plagiarized lyrics (\"how I wish, how I wish you were\
  \ here\"), the occasional limerick. I stuff the notes back into this secret wailing\
  \ wall.\n\_\nIn Hindi, \"alone\" is the same word as \"lonely.\" I rarely could\
  \ sit alone like this in India: simultaneously invisible\_and\_surrounded by a measured\
  \ buffer of personal space. The bartender could be\_my\_daughter, but she calls\
  \ me \"hun.\" \"You ok, hun?\" she asks like a statement, the firm tone you give\
  \ to a kid who's scraped her knee, if too kind a word might make her spill.\n\_\n\
  The deep fryer back in the kitchen sounds like rain. In India, I'd thought I would\
  \ be bathed in sun, but the monsoons chased me. I remember one drizzly night, strange\
  \ music of nasally horns and tinny drums lured me to a temple ground. I sat near\
  \ the wide trunk of a banyan tree. Looking up into the strangled vines, I was startled\
  \ to see a hundred plastic dolls hanging like ornaments. Some still wrapped in clear\
  \ cellophane, cheaply made\u2014faces smeared, cheeks dented, blonde polyester hair\
  \ shocked in one direction as if from a volcanic blast. Some round, peach-skinned\
  \ baby-dolls; some tiny, breasted women-dolls. The scale of Baby to Barbie was equal,\
  \ which was somehow disturbing. A woman selling incense and strings of sweet jasmine\
  \ explained: these were offerings for fertility. I imagined prayers from a hundred\
  \ women, wishing to be less alone.\n\_\nA young man leans over\_the\_empty bar stool\
  \ on my left. Scruffy, skateboard under one arm, he asks, \"How's it going?\" I\
  \ like his smile, but the slur in his voice hints at too much booze. \"So...I'm\
  \ leavin' town tomorrow,\" he lets me know. Asks if I want company. And though \"\
  company\" is what I've wanted for so long, I respond, \"I'm ok.\" (This is not true,\
  \ nor does it answer the question. I deliver it with the confidence of a solo traveler,\
  \ turning away.)\n\_\nIt's raining when I step outside. Autumn is coming. I plan\
  \ to leave again, go\_somewhere new,\_before it arrives. I'm counting on another\
  \ week of Indian summer. I crave that last precious spurt of hot short days. The\
  \ local river's too cold for swimming now. Maybe I can pretend it's the holy Ganges,\
  \ dip under for just a second, let it take\_my\_breath away, as I once did in back\
  \ in India.\n\_\nI stop for a moment, pressing\_my\_head and hands into the tall\
  \ chainlink on the overpass bridge. I breathe in the ocean of I-84, its incoming\
  \ tide of headlights, outgoing swell of taillights. At\_my\_feet, piles of maple\
  \ leaves, pinned to the sidewalk with rain. I kick them aside. They leave a shadow-stain:\
  \ scorched stars, stems, and veins. Seeking a sign for my next adventure, I follow\
  \ this arrow of elegant graffiti into the night."
