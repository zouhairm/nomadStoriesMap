Text: "It was June. I was done with all my exams, but didn\u2019t have any plans for\
  \ summer. All my friends had already booked trips with their families and I was\
  \ feeling a little bit left behind. The days gone by and online ads kept reminding\
  \ me all over the internet that there were a lot of exotic destinations for the\
  \ perfect summer trip and I was still in my room crying myself. \nI needed to do\
  \ something.  The situation couldn\u2019t get worse, so here came the question:\
  \ \u201CMom? Dad? Where did you say you are going this summer?\u201D and hadn\u2019\
  t even waited for a response: \u201CI want to join you\u201D. \nSo here we are,\
  \ one month later. One car, us three, thousands of luggage and a long way ahead.\
  \ Destination: Ouranoupoli, Greece. \nYou don\u2019t even know where this place\
  \ is located, do you? Me neither at that time. A quick search on the internet revealed\
  \ that it is a small harbor village, in the north of Greece. The road up there is\
  \ pretty tiring and when I said \u201Clong way\u201D I meant more than 9 hours from\
  \ Bucharest. \n\u201CDoes it worth it?\u201D I was asking myself. Then we were getting\
  \ closer and closer and I could feel it. There is a salty smell that you can taste\
  \ when you breathe it. Your hair already knows that will meet the sea and your skin\
  \ can\u2019t wait to embrace the warm sand. Your eyes can\u2019t stop watching how\
  \ the sun is lighting your way on that mountain road. You have the rocks on the\
  \ right and the Mediterranean Sea on your left. You couldn\u2019t wish for more.\
  \ \nWait. I\u2019ve said \u201Cyou couldn\u2019t wish for more\u201D? I was wrong.\
  \ Once you arrive in the village, you GET MORE: lying in the sand, enjoying the\
  \ wild nature, the slow waves, the sun. I could stay all day long on the beach and\
  \ it didn\u2019t even redden my skin. It gave me a shiny and natural long term tan.\
  \ The sun is just perfect there!\nAnd so are the rest of things in Ouranoupoli.\
  \ A habitual thing for the locals is to have their own boats. This is a real business\
  \ for some of them. Renting small boats became attractive when the tourists found\
  \ out there were a lot of beauties to discover apart from the village and a lot\
  \ of fun doing this. When my dad suggested me to rent a boat and to have our own\
  \ experience on the sea, I was really surprised. My adventure spirit it was looking\
  \ so faded compared to him and suddenly I felt like the most responsible one in\
  \ the family. But then I told to myself \u201CWhy not? You don\u2019t even need\
  \ a license for this type of boat, so everyone can drive it.\u201D\nWe had packed\
  \ usually things for a beach day and went to the harbor. A man was waiting to give\
  \ us the keys and to explain how the boat works and what directions is allowed to\
  \ go. Twenty minutes later you could see us floating on the sea. It was very exciting\
  \ to see how the boat moved away from the shore and the village was getting smaller\
  \ and smaller. There were many little islands where you can \u201Cpark\u201D your\
  \ boat and discover the surroundings. Some of them, more populated, had arranged\
  \ places to enjoy your cocktail and some of them (the greatest ones) no. Just nature.\
  \ Olives trees wherever you look in the back and blue clean water wherever you look\
  \ in front. As if it weren\u2019t enough, the sun gave me the most amazing sunset\
  \ I\u2019ve ever seen in my life. The warm colors embraced every part of me and\
  \ the sky looked calm and gentle.\nSeeing myself there, in the middle of a nowhere\
  \ which from then on I totally belonged to, was a unique emotion. It felt like a\
  \ immense freedom. No worries. Just you and your beloved ones. And your thoughts.\
  \ Thoughts like how simple things enjoy so much your soul or how lucky you are and\
  \ how far you could get if your dreams are big enough. \nSo, it was worth it? Definitly\
  \ yes!"
