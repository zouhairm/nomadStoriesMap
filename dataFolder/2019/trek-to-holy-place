Text: "My friend Susmita with her husband was back to Nepal from Qatar for a month-long\
  \ vacation. She shared her plan to flock Pathivara Temple, located on the hill of\
  \ Taplejung district at 3,798m height, which is considered to be one of the holy\
  \ place of Nepal as it is believed that a pilgrimage to the temple ensures fulfillment\
  \ of their wishes. \nSusmita asked me to pair up. My first intention was no but\
  \ to my surprise, the plan rushed to air. Finally, a team of six members kicked\
  \ off the trip at 6 am to a whole day bus ride and reached the district headquarter\
  \ Phungling at 6 pm.\nWe were supposed to take two hours ride on local jeep and\
  \ stay to Thulo fedi with three hours of trek on that day. But the matter differed.\
  \ Phunging Bajaar seemed to be celebrating a fair, crowded mass and vehicles bungled\
  \ up. There was a jeep stocked in the midway. The police man suggested us to stay\
  \ tonight as there was uncertainty about road unblocking and even the access to\
  \ shelter was tight down the place. We roamed around and stayed at headquarter that\
  \ night.   \nWith early morning rise at 2 am we set off the journey. Our divine\
  \ body and spirit had a small back pack of raincoat and light food. Though the stocked\
  \ jeep was cleared, the pouring rain invited monologues. It was still deep dark.\
  \ We could only see as much as light of the jeep focused the front way. But I noticed\
  \ a turn where the left and right side of the road could lead to the curst of the\
  \ earth and the fear accelerated thinking of slip of the wheel when jeep jumped\
  \ to the drowning curve. Imagine the first phase of the road construction surfaced\
  \ with rain and human challenging the life to greet the divine power. When I was\
  \ thinking of probability of being headline in the newspaper, someone behind me\
  \ stated that we are all saved because of power of god as if she heard and replied\
  \ to my monologue. But deep inside, I was really afraid to death.\nWe reached the\
  \ start-point of trekking after two hours of adventurous ride and celebrated that\
  \ we were alive. The sunlight hadn\u2019t kissed the horizon. We just followed others\
  \ wondering if first one had purely seen the way. After one hour of trek, the rain\
  \ stopped and light even dispersed around. It was best moment to feel trapped with\
  \ the beauty of hills full of red rhododendrons. We could see the range of Kanchanjunja\
  \ mountains, the third highest peak in the world, as soft white cotton floating\
  \ around. It showed up just to stand tall at photographs and soon the view was vivid.\
  \ \nAfter three hours of trek, it became hard to push the body each stair up. The\
  \ right leg forwaded but the body remained neutral waiting for left leg to weigh\
  \ her up. Each time we enquired about time to reach the destination, we would get\
  \ the answer \u2018just fifteen minutes.\u2019 Later we knew it was way to boost\
  \ up for big heights. It was hard to climb up with mere body but we could see children\
  \ and old age people being carried by porter. \nFinally, we accomplished the height\
  \ of 3,798m, after seven hours of trek. I don\u2019t know if we could greet the\
  \ most faithful divine power but my state of mind was dominated by \u2018Yes I did\
  \ it\u2019. Though it isn\u2019t a big deal where people break the record of climbing\
  \ top summit Mount Everest, it made me embrace love for my own body and witness\
  \ country's developing status.\nI wished to roll down from top and find myself lying\
  \ to the bed of home but to make it real wasn\u2019t an easy task, once again. But\
  \ the way back felt different, even local jeep ride didn\u2019t matter at all. The\
  \ whole body was tired to worry anything. We stayed at headquarter that night and\
  \ returned back home the next day. Today helicopter has shortened the three-day\
  \ route to one hour but I wonder because memories last forever."
