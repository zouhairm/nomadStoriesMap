Text: 'When I was 2nd grade of senior high school, my friends and I went to Bali.
  We were there for a couple days. I had many impressive experiences during the vacation.


  First day, we visited Sanur Beach in the morning. We saw the beautiful sunrise together.
  It was a great scenery. Then, we checked in to the hotel. After prepared our selves,
  we went to Tanah Lot. We met so many other tourists there. They were not only domestic
  but also foreign tourists.


  Second day, we enjoyed the day on Tanjung Benoa beach. We played so many water sports
  such as banana boat, jetsky, speedboat etc. We also went to Penyu island to see
  many unique animals. They were turtles, snakes, and sea birds. We were very happy.
  In the afternoon, we went to Kuta Beach to see the amazing sunset and enjoyed the
  beautiful wave.


  The last day, we spent our time in Sangeh. We could enjoy the green and shady forest.
  There were so many monkies. They were so tame but sometimes they could be naughty.
  We could make a close interaction with them. After that, we went to Sukowati market
  for shopping. That was my lovely time. I bought some Bali T-Shirt and souvenirs.


  In the evening, we had to check out from the hotel. We went back home bringing so
  many amazing memories of Bali.'
