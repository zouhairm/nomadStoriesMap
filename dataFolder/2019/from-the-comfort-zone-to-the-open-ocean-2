Text: "From the first of January I was walking Camino de Santiago from Portugal to\
  \ Spain and on the second day I saw surfers for the first time of my life. It was\
  \ so unforgettable. I almost started to cry while I was staring at them catching\
  \ waves and playing with the water. I could not believe that my dream was at arm's\
  \ length (and was almost forgotten). Next 7 days I was walking till Santiago de\
  \ Compostella in Spain and was still thinking about that I have to try. I don`t\
  \ know why and how ( probably the universe helps me every time I want something\
  \ badly) but after 2 weeks I already was in one of the best schools in Portugal\
  \ near West Coast. \nThe dramatic part of this story is that when I was 7 years\
  \ old I fell from inflatable mattress into water and I was under the water no more\
  \ than 10 seconds but I still remember this paralyzing fear and helplessness which\
  \ covers me every time I see water. \n\nI told about it to my surf instructor Tim\
  \ before we were on the way to the ocean but I didnt feel scared at all. \nWhen\
  \ I saw waves ( they were too big for the first lesson as I understood later), I\
  \ could not close my mouth - there is only one thing you feel when you see the power\
  \ of nature - feeling of complete unity with nature. From the big cliff we were\
  \ staring at the ocean I took a picture of a man who was going to surf and his figure\
  \ was so incredibly small in comparison with waves. \nAfter wearing second skin\
  \ ( we used wetsuits despite the fact that ocean usually warmer than air, but in\
  \ January it really can help to feel a little bit more confident in the water) I\
  \ was carrying my surf board for the first time in my life and I suddenly catched\
  \ a new pure feeling inside - I clearly inderstood that probably I would fail because\
  \ I didn`t have any skills to dive but the great desire to try really overshadowed\
  \ all doubts. \n\nActually it is some kind of a miracle - as soon as you want to\
  \ do something new, something scaring at first glance - once you make the first\
  \ step, this leap into the unknown - everything that is unnecessary goes away, and\
  \ you clearly see a picture in front of you, a map of actions to be done to achieve\
  \ the aim. \n\nFrom the shore, the waves seem not so big, but once you are in the\
  \ ocean till your waist (from a distance of 3-5 meters), staring at this huge ton\
  \ of water rushing at you, you realize that it will probably cover you for the next\
  \ 5-10 seconds without any ability to breath. \nMy first attempt I was walking deeper\
  \ and deeper hand by hand with Tim and it seemed to me I drank half of the ocean.\
  \ Now I understand that it was the greatest challenge in my life - I was under the\
  \ water again and again reminding this feeling of paralyzing fear which came exactly\
  \ every time with the next wave and covered me as well as the ocean water. \nI was\
  \ looking for some fulcrum in the water ( which doesn`t exist) and the most difficult\
  \ thing for me was just to relax and let the water take you back to the surface.\
  \ \nThan I clearly understood that the only thing I had to do is to turn to the\
  \ oncoming wave and straighten arms and ... after 5 seconds, during which I was\
  \ under water and was hearing only the overwhelming sound of the ocean, I was pushed\
  \ with the same wave to the surface. \nThis feeling is the best that I have experienced.\
  \ \nThen there was my first \u0441aught wave and the great feeling of relief that\
  \ I finally broke this barrier in my head! And this moment when you feel the wave\
  \ with your heels, began to paddle, push your body from the surf board and rushing\
  \ with the great speed on the wave - probably the best feeling in the world. At\
  \ such kind of moments you feel that you live."
