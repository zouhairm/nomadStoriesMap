Text: "It's not every day you cuddle a sheep. Yet here I am, sweating under the relentless\
  \ Australian sun, with Pumpkin sprawled across my lap. She is not light. Abandoned\
  \ by her mother and hand-reared by farmers John and Vicki, Pumpkin now thinks she's\
  \ one of the farm's Doberman puppies, mildly crushing me with her enthusiasm. \n\
  \  \nPumpkin's exuberant welcome is a perfect initiation to warm, enveloping Young\
  \ hospitality, a rural farming town in New South Wales. Everyone notices and welcomes\
  \ the out of towner, the Pom that the Payne girl has brought home. I find myself\
  \ discussing the impact of frost on this years' tomato crop at the farmers\u2019\
  \ market, socialising with rotary club members at Grove Estate vineyard and admiring\
  \ the cricket memorabilia proudly displayed in the IGA. I am escorted to several\
  \ family farms like a visiting dignitary, and gifted cherries, olive oil and a ride\
  \ in a combine harvester. \n\nJacqui has been insisting I join her in her hometown\
  \ since I became an honourary Sydneysider, and finally after a full year prioritising\
  \ the backpacker haunts of Australia's East Coast, I agree. All I know of Young\
  \ is that it's the Cherry Capital of Australia, famous for juicy stone fruit and\
  \ the National Cherry Festival held every December. What I don\u2019t know, being\
  \ both British and a city dweller, is how Young and other rural towns are being\
  \ crushed financially and emotionally by one of the worst recorded droughts in Australian\
  \ history. I\u2019ve seen signs in supermarkets, \u2018buy Aussie, support our farmers,\u2019\
  \ and I\u2019ve worn a flannel shirt to work to raise money, but I don\u2019t know\
  \ the bleak reality for these communities, where some farmers are not only shooting\
  \ their starving livestock but also themselves under the punishing sun. Prince Harry\
  \ during his visit to the Hilltops region called these communities the 'Salt of\
  \ the earth, honest, hardworking and as tough as they come', urging them not to\
  \ give up hope in the promise of their land.  \n\nDriving west from Sydney the colours\
  \ of the landscape shift. The cronulla crop stretches endlessly, bleached golden,\
  \ the sky a paler blue without the reflection of the ocean. We stay at a small farmhouse\
  \ with a rusty water tank in the backyard, a screen door with its fly netting gaping\
  \ with holes, peeling away, and a vista over the fields. It is harsh yet beautiful,\
  \ an environment requiring the inherent toughness Prince Harry describes. Before\
  \ long, I\u2019m clinging on to the back of a dusty ute, bumping over uneven surfaces\
  \ of cut cronulla to reach the paddock being harvested that day. The combine harvester,\
  \ or header, a giant beast of machinery cuts its way towards us, roaring and spewing\
  \ out a fine dust. My nose twitches, my eyes run, until Jacqui\u2019s uncle hauls\
  \ me into the little air-conditioned bubble protected from the irritant dust, eagerly\
  \ explaining the rhythm of his life. It transpires that the majority of his cronulla\
  \ crop is exported to Europe, supplying KFC with their frying-oil. I think of all\
  \ the hot salty chips devoured at an anonymous M25 service station. I will never\
  \ eat KFC again without remembering Young\u2019s sprawling, arid fields.\n\nWhilst\
  \ Young farmers quietly continue with business as usual, there is building determination\
  \ amongst the younger generations to push back against the oppressive weight of\
  \ tough times. My final night in Young is spent admiring giant photos of farmers\
  \ going about their routine, completely in the nude. I am at the launch party of\
  \ the Hilltops Naked Farmer calendar, a clever collection of rural scenes with artfully\
  \ posed residents, a cowboy hat here, a rifle there. Salt of the earth indeed. All\
  \ proceeds from the calendar are going towards the establishment of a mental health\
  \ safe house for the men and youth of the Hilltops region. This is a local gathering,\
  \ several young men blink slowly at my unfamiliar Pommie accent, before quickly\
  \ offering me a cold one and a burger off the barbie. They walk me through the months\
  \ of the year and as I gaze at the bare bottom of a farmer surveying his sheep,\
  \ I wonder if Pumpkin is hidden in there somewhere, ready to jump into someone else\u2019\
  s lap."
