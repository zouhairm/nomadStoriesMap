Text: "It\u2019s nice to live next to one of the most marvelous places in the world.\
  \ I pack my backpack, buy a bus ticket and after six hours I\u2019m already on the\
  \ biggest island of the lake Baikal \u2013 Olhon \u2013 the heart of the lake. \n\
  The Baikal is diverse for everyone, but no one can stay unconcerned about it. Every\
  \ trip is a different experience every time. And his trip will be no exception.\
  \ It\u2019s autumn, not summer, when people go here to swim, get tanned, and walk\
  \ around green forests, and not winter, when photographers and tourists come here\
  \ to see Baikal ice clear as window glass and beautiful as a blue marble. It\u2019\
  s calm and not crowded here in September, and you can enjoy it even more, cause\
  \ in such a spiritual place you come not for photos, which are beautiful anyway,\
  \ not for food, even if fish here is the tastiest, not just for vacation. You come\
  \ because it\u2019s the best place to think and figure out your life and make your\
  \ head clear. And it helps, you can finally hear your own thoughts near this great\
  \ power around you, away from the buzzing city.\nFor the first time I came on the\
  \ island when I was only one-year-old. My parents traveled around it in canoes before\
  \ my birth and didn\u2019t give up tradition to spend every summer here after having\
  \ two children. Neither did I, even after their divorce, even when I became older.\
  \ I come here every summer with my friend or just by myself. Every single summer.\n\
  In the childhood coming here was an adventure like in books and films. My sister\
  \ and I were running around with sticks, imagining we are in the Lord of rings world,\
  \ and the views were as great as in the movies. In every shadow in the wood, in\
  \ every sound, spark on water were something magical for us, something from local\
  \ myths and legends. Once we found a big old rusty key in the mountings and were\
  \ trying to put it in every hole in the rocks to open magical Aladdin's treasure\
  \ cave. We were fighting with the storm on my father\u2019s boat, the mast got broken\
  \ and it felt like the pirates\u2019 adventure, scary and breathtaking at the same\
  \ time. \nIn here it\u2019s hard not to feel the force of nature. In the clear,\
  \ bright blue or dark grey storm sky, in the flowers growing on the rocks, in the\
  \ wind so powerful and almost never stops. I saw absolutely calm water on the Baikal\
  \ only twice, once on my last trip with parents, in the early morning, when the\
  \ fog was sneaking in the water mirror and the silence was so absolute it felt like\
  \ the world has stopped. And today, when I needed to go here the most, to find calm\
  \ and clear mind again, before one of the most important twist in my life."
