Text: "\u201CYou are in Sri Lanka, they have amazing beaches here and the waves are\
  \ perfect. Just challenge yourself. Learn surfing.\u201D, those were his words.\
  \ Almost on a daily basis he mentioned this to me. It was more than annoying, and\
  \ I kept resisting. For me one thing was for sure, it\u2019s never going to happen.\
  \ \n\nI focused on my journey and the reason why I was there. I immersed myself\
  \ in the nature I was surrounded by. Walked through the jungle, visited the rainforest\
  \ and strolled along the endless beaches. Watched sunsets highlighting the shape\
  \ of Buddhas statue on top of the mountain, while enjoying the best street food\
  \ I ever tasted, wrapped in the latest Sri Lankan Newspaper. This was a surreal\
  \ experience set in a breath-taking scenery. Sri Lanka surprised me on a high level.\
  \ It was simply amazing. I felt content with my decision of coming here. \n\nAnd\
  \ yet my mind always started to wonder. \n\nWhat was it about this island that made\
  \ it so special? Why were the people so caring and kind? Not every country you travel\
  \ to welcomes you so openly. I decided to dig a little deeper. Read about the history\
  \ of the country. The struggles they went through. And the deeper I dug the more\
  \ I realised that there was something beyond my perception. Something I still wasn\u2019\
  t quite aware of. So, I kept searching.  \n\nAnd then one day I found the missing\
  \ piece in my jigsaw. Recent history unfolded itself in front of me when I strolled\
  \ along the beach of Hikkaduwa. There were a lot of abandoned houses. And I stopped\
  \ in front of one. It had colourful drawings on it. Little donkeys playing football.\
  \ But the building was empty and outgrown by nature. Goosebumps started to tickle\
  \ my arms. I closed my eyes and tried to imagine how this place would have looked\
  \ before and I heard children playing around and chasing each other in the garden.\
  \ In pain I opened my eyes again and knew where I had to go. \n\nSo, I took a Tuk\
  \ Tuk to one of the darker times of Sri Lankas History, and I found myself on the\
  \ way to the Tsunami Museum. \n\nI knew I needed to learn more about this since\
  \ it was so much bigger than anything I could possibly understand without any help.\
  \ The idea of this sleeping danger out there, which was a threat, that could basically\
  \ return any moment and take everything away again, made me flinch. I walked through\
  \ the museum, listened to locals and looked at photos from that day. Eventually\
  \ I silently left the museum, trapped in my thoughts and trying to work through\
  \ what I\xB4ve just seen. \n\nIt took me a few days to realise what really happened\
  \ in this part of Sri Lanka around ten years ago. I often reflected on it while\
  \ I was sitting on the beach, listening to the waves and feeling the gentle breeze\
  \ on my skin. \n\nMy mind started to wonder off again. The power of nature. And\
  \ how little we actually are. One move and everything can be over within seconds.\
  \ I felt it. I heard the power of the waves. As if every time they hit the shore\
  \ a warning came along. Respect and awe overcame me again and again. And then I\
  \ realised. I realised what the local people were doing. They accepted that you\
  \ cannot fight the waves. But you can accept them. And even more. You can dare to\
  \ become a part of them. \n\nOnce I realised this my mind became calm and a smile\
  \ formed itself on my face. \n\nThe next morning I walked past my boss and as he\
  \ asked again: \u201CWhen are you going to learn surfing?\u201D. I replied with\
  \ a smile in my face: \u201CToday.\u201D \n\nAnd then I started to surf, and I loved\
  \ it. I stood on the board and felt the power of the wave, which carried me. My\
  \ respect and awe became part of my lesson. \nCause if I learnt one thing from my\
  \ visit to this beautiful country \u2013  if you can\u2019t fight it, you might\
  \ as well make it a pleasant part of your life."
