Text: "My soul boosted up the second after I got out of the plane. I whispered to\
  \ myself, \"I am home, I am back\", it's The Island of God, Bali, Indonesia. The\
  \ air was quite different, I felt more alive, it woke me up in such a disparate\
  \ phase of life. I stepped out of the airport and the smell of incense started to\
  \ hypnotize me, it was peaceful. Tourists and locals, there is no gap, they were\
  \ just strolling around with their bike, everyone seemed ecstatic. The sun was brighter\
  \ than ever. \n\nFor me, this is a place where it finally allows you to forgive,\
  \ serve, and love yourself, even better. It's where one culture meets new ones.\
  \ It's where we all here embracing the same thing. It's the place where it gives\
  \ you everlasting happiness. It's where everything is in its own place. Everything\
  \ just right. \n\nI stayed in Canggu, almost one hour from the airport. A year ago,\
  \ it was my first time visiting Canggu and at that exact time, I knew, I belong\
  \ in here. It is less crowded, not to say that the crowds here are bad because it\
  \ is not. Canggu has everything in it, beaches, rice fields, thrift stores, gym,\
  \ beach & night clubs. \n\nSimple life. That's what I always wanted. Back where\
  \ I live, everyone seems to be always in a rush. It's different here in Bali, I\
  \ feel so much healthier and happier here. To spend each morning looking for a nice\
  \ breakfast, off to work, and then the beach, to always have time for myself, to\
  \ let myself heal, to always take the sacred shortcut road. \n\nI want to thank\
  \ myself. I want to thank everyone I met, I want to thank my best friend to be here\
  \ with me, I want to thank the mother nature, I want to thank the dogs here for\
  \ being nice to me. I want to thank my landlord for always smiling and brighten\
  \ my day, I want to thank myself for letting me to be free. \n\nThank you."
