Text: "As we whiz along the highway with our friendly Swiss acquaintance Andy at the\
  \ wheel, my friend Maggie and I marvel at the quaint Swiss countryside. We are coming\
  \ from the small town of Nyon, Switzerland, and we\u2019re traveling toward the\
  \ Pre-Alps. Although the details of our destination are still a mystery to us, we\
  \ are grateful to be accompanied by a knowledgeable local, who will be showing us\
  \ one of his favourite destinations. We had met Andy just once before, and he kindly\
  \ offered to host us when we showed up in Switzerland.\n\n\tWe speed through the\
  \ winding, steep roads in an effort to catch the last funicular ride up the mountain.\
  \ Fortunately we arrive with three minutes to spare, so we rush into the funicular\
  \ and start our journey. It\u2019s overcast and rainy, but as we ascend higher the\
  \ sun radiates through the clouds onto the rolling hillsides. The mountains look\
  \ as though they are covered in a green blanket dotted with small farmhouses, winding\
  \ gravel roads, and rows of pine trees.\n\n\tAfter the funicular ride, we opt to\
  \ take a short walk up the mountain towards Mol\xE9son instead of taking the cable\
  \ car. After about half an hour the breezy walk becomes more of an upward climb.\
  \ Did I mention that I\u2019m afraid of heights? The terrain becomes steeper and\
  \ the path narrower, and then the path temporarily ends with just a few metal poles\
  \ jetting out of the mountainside in its place. I put one shaky foot in front of\
  \ the other and, with a great sigh of relief, make it over to the other side. We\
  \ continue hiking and eventually see a lodge in the distance upon a mountaintop.\n\
  \n\tThe Observatory Lodge is a dormitory style accommodation situated at the summit\
  \ of mount Mol\xE9son, at an altitude of 2,002 metres. As soon as we reach the lodge\
  \ deck, we drop our bags and gaze over the railing at the astounding view. Mountaintops\
  \ peak through the clouds below us, and rays of sun shine through the clouds above\
  \ us, highlighting only a few select areas. Small villages are scattered throughout\
  \ the distant valleys and even though it is June, some areas of the slopes have\
  \ snow on them.\n\n\tWe go inside to the triangular shaped dining room, which has\
  \ a vaulted wood ceiling and large windows lining each side, and we are amazed that\
  \ we have the whole place to ourselves. We walk across the room and climb the wooden\
  \ stairs that lead to the Observatory, which is home to one of the world\u2019s\
  \ most powerful set of binoculars. It offers a panoramic 360\xB0 view encompassing\
  \ Lake Geneva, Jura, Mont-Blanc, and the Bernese Highlands, so we enjoy the expansive\
  \ view and then go for dinner. \n\n\tOne of the corners in the dining area has a\
  \ booth that jets out from the mountainside, so naturally we choose that spot. Our\
  \ meal begins with an authentic Swiss fondue that is half Gruy\xE8res cheese and\
  \ half Vacherin Fribourgeois cheese, which was a thoughtful pre-arrangement by Andy.\
  \ He explains that the Gruy\xE8res cheese is from the medieval town of Gruy\xE8\
  res, which is located in the foothills of the Pre-Alps, which is known for its delectable\
  \ cheese, prestigious castle, and historic preservation. After enjoying fondue,\
  \ fresh bread, and crisp vegetables, we venture back outside to catch a glimpse\
  \ of the mountains at night.\n\n\tBundled up in layers of clothing, blankets wrapped\
  \ around us, and sitting in chairs perched on top of a picnic table, we share stories,\
  \ laugh, and try to express the magnificence of the mountains through words. As\
  \ the evening lays its veil of darkness, we enjoy the stars and then retreat inside\
  \ to the warmth of the lodge for the night.\n\n\tAfter awakening to the fresh mountain\
  \ air, we decide to descend in the cable car. As we take in the stunning views for\
  \ the last time, I feel a wave of gratitude wash over my body. Maggie and I have\
  \ experienced an exciting journey up a mountain, seen expansive landscapes, and\
  \ tasted authentic Swiss food, all due to our now good-friend Andy, who showed us\
  \ a local\u2019s perspective."
