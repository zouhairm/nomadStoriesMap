Text: "The morning light came through the window. The hidden colonies of birds were\
  \ singing in the hills. I saw my traveling companion move across the far shadows\
  \ of the room where a cellular signal might be caught to hurl a message across the\
  \ globe. I closed my eyes. The call to prayer began to echo and rattle through the\
  \ air. \n        In Kashmir there is a local legend that a house exists that was\
  \ once lived in by Jesus of Nazareth and his bride Mary Magdalene. The Rose House.\
  \ It is a hushed piece of local folklore that lives amidst the ache and solitude\
  \ of the valley.\n\tI was staying with three others in the city of Srinigar in the\
  \ India-occupied region for two weeks as part of an independent documentary project.\
  \ We were working with a local human rights group to meet with victims of the occupation.\
  \ We would spend intermittent days exploring the remote areas\u2019 lush beauty,\
  \ its tulip gardens, abandoned palaces, Himalayan foothills, and the sites of its\
  \ obscure legends.\n       We were joined at breakfast by Tannan, a young Kashmiri\
  \ student who found a spirit of his own in his ability to express the causes, vexations,\
  \ and possible solutions to his homeland. He dreamed big dreams yet rooted himself\
  \ in fact like a historian. He brought us a bag of grapes as a token of good measure.\n\
  \      \u201CNot everyone is allowed to see the Rose Hose,\u201D he said with a\
  \ smile of allurement, \u201Cbut you must come and see it. It is the house where\
  \ Jesus stayed when he lived in Kashmir.\u201D\n\n\tWe pulled up to a white fort\
  \ like structure. Tannan handed me a slip of paper that said \u201CSHO Officer Arvez\u201D\
  . The Rose House was off limits to the public and we had to be granted access by\
  \ the local police. How often a group of tourists came in off the street requesting\
  \ the presence of the officer in charge? I had no idea. \n\tWe were led into the\
  \ shadowy unlit dwelling of Officer Arvez. He sat at a large desk sipping tea from\
  \ a small decorative cup. He had the ticker tape of unrest whirling through him.\
  \ His eyes, though sunken with heaviness, stared out vigilant and unblinking.\n\
  \        A few desk lamps pocketed the atmosphere. Large maps hung behind us on\
  \ the far wall from where Arvez sat facing. Most areas of the map were shaded, signifying\
  \ that they were under his jurisdiction. \n        \u201CPlease, sit,\u201D he said\
  \ in a soft authoritative tone. \u201CHow are you liking your travels?\u201D\n\t\
  \u201CWe\u2019re enjoying ourselves tremendously,\u201D I responded jovially, trying\
  \ to mask our uncertainty. \u201CIt\u2019s quite lovely here. We\u2019re thinking\
  \ of going up to Gulmarg mountain tomorrow.\u201D\n\tArvez stared into each of our\
  \ eyes separately as we spoke, as if to detect a give away from the outskirts of\
  \ the center of attention. He drained the dregs of his tea glass.\n\t\u201CSo you\
  \ want to see where Jesus lived?\u201D he said. We nodded in response.\n\n     \
  \   We took off our shoes and entered. The house, as far as I could see, was one\
  \ story with two rooms. In the air lingered a spiced woody scent. The first room\
  \ was a foyer with small wooden benches along the wall. The ground was carpeted\
  \ with a silk like fabric. In the center of the second room was a very large casket\
  \ with a decorative sheet draped over it. Whether entombing of remnants- bodily\
  \ or totem, hair, nail, or used object, I do not know. It was not explained.\n \
  \       Surrounding the casket was plexi-glass on all sides, extending from floor\
  \ to ceiling. Congregations of faded lip imprints left a residue of love and admiration.\n\
  \        The casket itself looked enormous, like it housed a ten-foot body. Within\
  \ the confinement were two foot prints, made in clay, both 15 or 16 inches. The\
  \ enlarged stature seemed a symbolic gesture created to compare the houses\u2019\
  \ stoic bareness to the idol it was memorial to. Jesus, the room seemed to say,\
  \ was a living mansion, so needed no physical palace. \n\tA young Kashmiri boy peered\
  \ inside from an open window and tossed in a coin as we moved in a slow dance around\
  \ the entombment."
