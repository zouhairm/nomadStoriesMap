Text: "\u201CWhy am I in this situation? How did I get up here, on this empty mountain,\
  \ with no shoes?\u201D I wondered being overwhelmed by how many bad decisions I\
  \ took in within a few hours.\nThe love for travelling by myself took off when I\
  \ moved to Iceland. Hitchhiking, camping, hiking, it didn\u2019t matter to me. So\
  \ one summer I decided to go on a trip to the West Peninsula, known as Westfjords.\
  \ The first night I barely slept because it was too cold and, not really having\
  \ a plan, the following day I decided to go somewhere close by, hike on a mountain\
  \ to possibly see Greenland. Little I knew what was about to happen.\nI waited for\
  \ a while, and finally, I hitchhiked a car that dropped me off in the next city.\_\
  So there I was in front of a mountain from where I was convinced if I go high enough\
  \ I can see Greenland. I left my backpack in some bushes being sure there is a path\
  \ somewhere up in the distance. It took me quite a while to reach that point, but\
  \ still no path. All around me there were just rocks and moss. \nI was alone, on\
  \ a mountain, the wrong mountain, with a huge black bird flying above me. As soon\
  \ as I started going down, my hiking shoes said farewell, giving up on me. And not\
  \ even halfway down, I was in my socks. Did I mention I didn\u2019t have another\
  \ spare of shoes with me while being 500 km away from home? It took me more than\
  \ one hour to actually climb down the very steep mountain, my feet getting all soaking\
  \ wet and starting to hurt because of some sharp rocks. I was holding tight on some\
  \ plants in order to go down and sometimes I couldn\u2019t even see at all where\
  \ I was stepping. \nI reached solid ground again, I was with no doubt very exhausted.\
  \ I still had to walk for half an hour back to take my backpack, passing by some\
  \ houses on the way to the main road. But all I could think\_of\_were my socks.\
  \ I was so grateful for them, really trying to focus only on that. I was distracting\
  \ myself from how bad the situation was by imagining writing a book about how I\
  \ managed to hitchhike my way back to Reykjavik in my socks. \nRight about that\
  \ time something magic happened. Looking behind me, to see if there are any cars\
  \ coming, I saw a girl following me. I\u2019ve stopped when she asked me if I\u2019\
  m alright. I didn\u2019t know what to say. She asked me what happened, and I just\
  \ managed to say I hiked the wrong mountain. While I was looking down being too\
  \ ashamed to make eye contact, she handed me a pair of sports shoes. \n\u201CMy\
  \ father saw you from the house, we don\u2019t need these shoes as much as you do.\
  \ He asked me to bring it to you and ask if there is anything else we could help\
  \ with.\u201D I instantly had tears rushing down my face, I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ this was actually happening. I hugged and thanked her, and apologised for being\
  \ so irresponsible. She smiled back at me and asked me to be more careful next time.\
  \ She also told me the mountain I was supposed to be on existed, just ten kilometres\
  \ away and I could have easily gone there by car. \nFeeling very discouraged on\
  \ top of that mountain, I quickly learned to pay attention and having a second pair\
  \ of shoes can take you a long way. Little I knew this adventure was, in fact, teaching\
  \ me about humanity and kindness, knowing when to ask for help. About human nature\
  \ and how, even when everything seems lost, there is still a helping hand at the\
  \ end of your struggles. And sometimes that helping hand has shoes exactly your\
  \ size, just like in a fairy-tale."
