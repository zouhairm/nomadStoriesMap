Text: "I was woken up by the loud noises outside my tent in a tiny riverside camp\
  \ of Rishikesh. I remembered sleeping peacefully the night before and couldn't fathom\
  \ from where the noises were coming from so I decided to go out and inspect why\
  \ there was a rant on this perfect Sunday sunny morning. Stepping out of my tent\
  \ I stretched my arms and gave out a long yawn, my friend came rushing to me and\
  \ told me that the owner of the camp had asked our group of 40-50 people to leave\
  \ as there had been a warning to clear off the riverside areas. So, long story short\
  \ we had to pack our bags and leave Rishikesh by evening because we had nowhere\
  \ to go. But I chose not to accept this terrible fate as I still had to visit The\
  \ Beatles Ashram, which was pretty much the reason I came on this trip. So it was\
  \ decided that me and my group of 5 friends would meet everyone at the Bus Stand\
  \ at 4pm where we would take our bus back to Delhi. At 12pm Six people of the camp\
  \ were out on the streets of Rishikesh looking for a bus to the Ram Jhula from where\
  \ Beatles Ashram was quite near atleast that's what google maps said. We took a\
  \ bus to Lakshman Jhula and thought we would decide the further course of action\
  \ when we reach Lakshman Jhula. I was keeping strict track of time because it was\
  \ a commodity which we didn't have in abundance. We reached Lakshman Jhula at 12:30pm\
  \ and started our journey towards Ram Jhula which was 2Kms away after I stopped\
  \ a small traveller and we agreed to pay him \u20B920 each for a ride till Ram Jhula.\
  \ All of us reached Ram Jhula at 1:30 pm because we were treated by Heavy traffic\
  \ on our way and all our spirits were washed away. For one long hour all we did\
  \ was sit in the car and listen to catchy pahadi songs which were on the back of\
  \ our minds for the next 24 hours. \nWhen we reached Ram Jhula all 5 friends of\
  \ mine decided to abandon me and go for a swim because they were so tired. I was\
  \ devastated as I checked Google maps and saw the Ashram was on the other side of\
  \ the river. All this effort was for nothing. \nThen I heard someone play another\
  \ catchy pahadi song and it made me smile thinking about how I would never anytime\
  \ soon get the opportunity to visit this Mystically Brilliant place again. So I\
  \ pulled out my mind from the well of sadness it was in and decided I would visit\
  \ Beatles Ashram alone with my 10Kg luggage and Big back pack and my friends would\
  \ meet me at the Bus Stand where they would ensure the bus doesn't leave without\
  \ me after they've finished their swim. \nWithout anything else being said, I picked\
  \ myself up and walked towards the boarding area for the boat where I had to purchase\
  \ two round way tickets for me and my bag. The boat ride was quite comfortable once\
  \ you had a good seat, the boat had good balance and was infact very crowdy and\
  \ was filled with excited kids and hindu devotees who wanted to pay a tribute to\
  \ the Holy River Ganga on which we were floating on.  We reached the other side\
  \ of the river in 10 mins. I got off the boat and there was a sweet sound of a Hindu\
  \ Mantra playing somewhere in a temple, there were almost 500 devotees but no noise\
  \ or chaos. Everything looked so surreal and peaceful, swarg ashram had welcomed\
  \ me well. After inquiring I realised I had to travel 1km more to reach Beatles\
  \ Ashram with my luggage, ON FOOT. It took me almost 30 mins to reach the ruins\
  \ of a beautiful Ashram where the Beatles had once taken shelter. I was so tired\
  \ but I forgot everything when I saw the place, I boarded the Bus at 4:30pm and\
  \ slept the whole way back home. Never had I been so tired but yet so satisfied."
