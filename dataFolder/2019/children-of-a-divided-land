Text: "A three-foot-high, gray concrete wall ran down the middle of the main street\
  \ of Hebron, West Bank, dividing it into two halves. The wall was one of the first\
  \ things that our guide, Avner, pointed at as we entered the Israel-controlled sector\
  \ of the divided city. \n\n\u201CThis side is for Jews, and that\u2019s for Palestinians,\u201D\
  \ he said. \n\nHebron is located not more than 20 miles south of Jerusalem. The\
  \ Israeli government has split the largest city in the West Bank into two religious\
  \ sites  \u2014 the Tomb of the Patriarchs for the Jews to pray in and the Abrahami\
  \ Mosque as the Muslims\u2019 place of worship.\n\nDevotees of both faiths pass\
  \ through the divided main street to reach their respective places of worship. The\
  \ dividing wall is not high enough to hide each other\u2019s faces. But would a\
  \ Jew see a Muslim in the eye? Will they ever greet each other or, at least, acknowledge\
  \ each other\u2019s presence? I would find out soon. \n\nFrom the door of a house\
  \ on the Palestinian side of the wall, a girl not older than five came running towards\
  \ me. Perhaps the camera I held in my hand attracted her. Dressed in a purple jumpsuit,\
  \ her undone hair carelessly fell over her shoulders. She had a sweet smile while\
  \ she was still close to her door, but as she approached the wall her smile progressively\
  \ faded and confusion clouded her eyes. She placed her small palms on the wall,\
  \ which was almost her height, trying to reach me.\n\nIt later occurred to me that\
  \ while the child was still relatively far from me, she could see me. As she came\
  \ closer to the wall, I became less visible to her because of her height, hence\
  \ the uncertainty in her eyes. \n\nAs we walked down that street, I began to blame\
  \ the wall for everything. The physical barrier seemed to strengthen the mental\
  \ and psychological barriers that the Israelis and Palestinians have built between\
  \ them.\n\nAs we began our journey on the Israeli side of the city, we were told\
  \ we couldn\u2019t venture into the Palestinian side. A heavy-set guard, dressed\
  \ in an Israeli army uniform, had walked towards us briskly, even when we were outside\
  \ the city limits, and politely threatened us to not have too much interaction with\
  \ the Palestinian side of the city. Our cameras had further scared that mammoth\
  \ creature who thought we would disrupt the troubled peace in the city.\n\nHaving\
  \ reminded myself of the bulky Israeli guard, I stopped short of reaching out to\
  \ the child.  \n\nThe Israel-Palestine dispute is so deeply entrenched that it permeates\
  \ generations and shows little signs of dissipating in the near future. Hebron stands\
  \ as a symbol of that embedded discord, which is at once religious, territorial,\
  \ social, political and economic in nature. \n\nEndless debates about the nature\
  \ of the conflict, does not diminish the fact that lives of millions of people are\
  \ unquestionably disrupted.\n\nThe few hours we were permitted in the city were\
  \ spent treading slowly on that one main street along the Holy site that meets the\
  \ Shuhuda Street. Avner explained that Shuhuda Street had once been the main street\
  \ of Hebron. Now it looked colourless, almost lifeless. All we saw was the brown\
  \ of the dry sandy wind that blew into our eyes and the gray concrete of the streets.\
  \ Except for a living, breathing Israeli soldier toting a gun in his hand, the only\
  \ other sign of life was the graffiti splattered on the walls and on shuttered shops.\
  \ \"GO BACK ISRAEL\" \n\nThe Holy Land is divided everywhere, fraught and tense.\
  \ But in Hebron the tension is most palpable. As tangible as the 3-foot-wall. When\
  \ you touch and feel something, you cannot deny it even if you close your eyes."
