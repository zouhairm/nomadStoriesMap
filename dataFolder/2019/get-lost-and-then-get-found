Text: "Every January, I travel with some friends, it\u2019s my new\u2019s year ritual.\
  \ This year was the 3rd time, always on the same camping, always in the same beaches,\
  \ on the same days, it was comfortable and felt like home, we knew the path, we\
  \ knew when it would rain, the tide. The camping site is Tendal, the owners, Roger\
  \ and Rosana, created an intimate space where peace and freedom prevalence. It\u2019\
  s almost a rainforest refugee on Diogo\u2019s village, Bahia, Brazil, the village\
  \ itself is small, with some restaurants around the main beach, that\u2019s all\
  \ that I knew.\nLast year, Rosana told us that Imbassa\xED river passes nearby the\
  \ camping, and we went, the water\u2019s always warm and the river has a brown shade,\
  \ it was quiet and revigorating. It was surely added to our itinerary, but this\
  \ year I wanted more. There were two ways to get to Santo Ant\xF4nio beach, by the\
  \ sand dunes and by the road, the one we always went to, it was easier and not everyone\
  \ was willing to make through the dunes. But this year, I wanted more. Third day\
  \ of our trip and the route to the dunes seemed easy, we could do it anytime but\
  \ only me and my then boyfriend went. \nMy first surprise was how many restaurants\
  \ and bars there is in this part of the village, the one that\u2019s only four minutes\
  \ walk from our camping site and that we never saw. And that was people, a lot of\
  \ them. Locals sitting at the door of their houses, tourists going and coming, as\
  \ we spent most of our days in the camping or going to another beaches we didn\u2019\
  t get to see many people. When we get to the sign that warned us in what direction\
  \ the dunes were the sand started to cover the parallelepipeds, the vegetation was\
  \ dense and the sand was incredibly cold making it easier to walk, the river was\
  \ nearby, everything was refreshing. But it didn\u2019t last long, when we actually\
  \ got to the dunes there weren\u2019t trees, just some bushes unfairly distributed\
  \ and the sand was scorching, it was almost dangerous to walk barefoot, and so white\
  \ your eyes can hurt. It would be impossible to get to the beach if we didn\u2019\
  t guide ourselves by the blue line on the horizon. When we got to the beach, the\
  \ water was so cold it was a reward for the incessant heat and long walk we just\
  \ faced. The beach was almost deserted and there were about 5 restaurants with great\
  \ food and low prices.\nGoing back to the dunes was easy, just follow the white\
  \ stripe on the horizon, but finding which one we should go to get to our way back\
  \ wasn\u2019t. First, we tried the one on the left, that one looked like the one\
  \ we passed by, it wasn\u2019t. We tried the next one, the one on the right, the\
  \ one on the left again. There wasn\u2019t no internet signal, so we were completely\
  \ lost and there wasn\u2019t anyone else around us. We could still laugh and hug\
  \ each other, even though we\u2019ve been walking in circles for more than one hour\
  \ with the sun right above our heads. That was precious. \nI was almost hopeless\
  \ when we saw a group of people, and that was our chance. We run to them, and we\
  \ can see a tour guide talking to this group of Spanish speakers, they smiled at\
  \ us. The tour guide was native, and knew how to speak Spanish and English fluently,\
  \ we didn\u2019t know his name, we couldn\u2019t even talk to him because we were\
  \ so exhausted, he just looked at us and said: \u201CYou guys got lost, right? It\u2019\
  s quite common\u201D and started telling his story and the stories he knew about\
  \ the dunes. We couldn\u2019t talk much, but we could listen. When I looked around\
  \ me I saw that I wanted more, but I already had everything, I just needed to look\
  \ with more attention. As Jorja Smith says in the song February 3rd, when sometimes\
  \ you could be lost, you could be found."
