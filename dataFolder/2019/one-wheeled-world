Text: "I first realized that I had to unicycle around the world a year and a half\
  \ ago, when I was spending time in the oldest grove of trees, the redwoods of Northern\
  \ California. I knew I had to leave my old normal life behind me and get out of\
  \ my comfort zone and into the fray. Two days later, a shirtless man pulling a wagon\
  \ behind him passed by, walking around the world!  Two weeks after that, I saw a\
  \ Facebook page: Unicycling Around the World, and sent a message. Both guys told\
  \ me the same thing: this is NOT a coincidence! I was a hoarder, and gave away my\
  \ most of my possessions, so I could move out of Portland, OR, and live in my truck\
  \ for a year, between Oregon, California, and New Mexico. This was stage one of\
  \ my bootcamp.\nOn January 9th with unicycle in my checked bag and overweight paid,\
  \ I was off to Paris for my first visit. For seven magical hours on my layover,\
  \ I walked from The Louvre to the Champs-Elysees to Arc Du Triumph, past canal party\
  \ barges, museums, The Eiffel Tower, City Hall, and through tiny streets with flagship\
  \ designer boutiques, Cathedral Notre-dame, Shakespeare & Co. I even ordered Escargot\
  \ and baguette for a late night dinner at Le Departure Restaurant at 3AM, before\
  \ heading out to my flight to Berlin! It was enchanting!\n\nBut, why did I choose\
  \ Berlin in Winter? With no reservation? To train in a free spirited mecca full\
  \ of freaks, is why! I was drawn here by the free spirit of the international culture\
  \ and rich history contained here. At the airport, I found a boat hostel on google,\
  \ and soon I was bobbing along peacefully in my new bed, next to my portal window\
  \ that looked out on the historic Oberbaumbr\xFCcke , one of only two bridges that\
  \ East Germans were only rarely allowed across to West Berlin for day visits with\
  \ their families. It was truly magical being there, despite the icy rain, wind,\
  \ and jet lag!  \nLittle did I know that I would soon be celebrating the German\
  \ Fasching Karnaval festival with one of my high school classmates and his German\
  \ wife in a tiny Bavarian town of 2000 people, seeing incredible surrealist architecture\
  \ with another old friend from New Orleans in Magdeburg, touring a pipe organ factory,\
  \ training in front of the Wall Museum and East Side Gallery, getting free entrance\
  \ to an experimental music festival in the top rated club on earth, where a synthetic\
  \ ice rink had been installed, or having emergency surgery to have an abscessed\
  \ cyst on my shoulder removed!  (I'm certainly glad that my parents insisted that\
  \ I get a Nomads Insurance policy before I left The States!!!)  I can only imagine\
  \ how much more amazing this will be once spring arrives here in Berlin. I'm going\
  \ to continue preparing for my ride by crafting a looping music project, for cultural\
  \ exchange, across language, monetary, and class lines, and to support myself en\
  \ route. I want to collaborate with other circus performers and musicians, leveraging\
  \ my quest with philanthropy opportunities for charities and worthy causes along\
  \ the way. I hope it'll open doors that the traditional consumer tourism model wouldn't\
  \ allow me to pass. My slower travelling pace will afford me more nuanced textures\
  \ of beauty and daily life wherever I go, and allow for cooperative cultural appreciation\
  \ and exchange.\nI'll riding through Europe and Egypt, South Sudan, Kenya, where\
  \ I grew up in Malawi, and on to Madagascar, Capetown, Namibia, Zanzibar and the\
  \ rest of this beautiful Nation Of Planet Earth.  I believe that with enough conscious\
  \ cross-pollination we can all learn to celebrate and sustain each other in new\
  \ and powerful ways that will bring about a more peaceful and consensual planet;\
  \ without borders, poverty, or hunger.. I know that I'm about to have the adventure\
  \ of my life, and I can't wait to write all about it and post my amazing photos\
  \ . Join me on my One Wheeled World Blog and Instagram pages, and catch a glimpse\
  \ of a different view of the planet, through my lens.  As they say in Deutschland,\
  \ Tsch\xFC\xDF !~Sid Simpatico"
