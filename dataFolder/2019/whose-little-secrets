  \ you were a \u2026\u201D\n\n\u201C\u2026 A local\u2026?\u201D\n\nI honestly had\
  \ not intended my retort to be so harsh. She quickly covered her mouth, trying to\
  \ hide the reddening tinge of her furious blushing. I immediately regretted my impatience,\
  \ and snapped my tone back in line with a smile.\n \n\u201CIt\u2019s alright. You\
  \ couldn\u2019t have known otherwise. But no; I\u2019m not from here, as I\u2019\
  m constantly reminded. I\u2019m as much a foreigner as you two.\u201D\n\nThe smile\
  \ worked. The unease they were clearly feeling briefly receded. Martha: as I later\
  \ learned her name was: continued to look around in a curious mix of fascination\
  \ and horror at the dramatically altered landscape, while her husband: Garrett:\
  \ dabbed his sweating forehead with the small rag. \n\n\u201CWere you here throughout?\u201D\
  \ Martha continued, tentatively. \n\n\u201CYes.\u201D I replied calmly.\n\n\u201C\
  May I ask what they were like?\u201D Her burgeoning confidence was annoyingly endearing,\
  \ but I was heading to a Ministry security briefing right now.\n\n\u201CLet\u2019\
  s just say, I have many enemies, and yet, I couldn\u2019t have wished this experience\
  \ on any of them!\u201D I saw her instinctively clutch her husband\u2019s arm in\
  \ response to that answer. She tried to avoid my eyes, peering southwest instead,\
  \ past my suited person, towards the distant peak of Mount Sage. I quietly let them\
  \ absorb the cataclysmic reality. \n\nI had seen the pair walking through the back\
  \ entrance of what had been my office\u2019s parking lot. Of course, there were\
  \ no longer any barricades or signposts. Those were somewhere littering the battered\
  \ mangroves nearby. I had observed the stream of passengers, as had many here in\
  \ Road Town, with umbrage. It was December 6, 2017, and they had arrived on the\
  \ first cruise ship to have returned since Irma and Maria had, three months earlier,\
  \ ravaged these islands, which the ad campaigns kept calling \u201CNature\u2019\
  s Little Secrets.\u201D I had wondered as to what kind of twisted psychopaths would\
  \ book a trip to see a location decimated by two Category 5 hurricanes passing it\
  \ within two weeks of each other. The sight of many, predominantly white people\
  \ coming to peer at many, predominantly black people in this vulnerable condition\
  \ struck a hostile chord in my Afro-conscious, Jamaican mind. \n\nHowever, when\
  \ Martha stopped me and asked how to get to the Botanical Gardens near Station Road\
  \ through all this chaos, it slowly dawned on me that these two pensioners from\
  \ Sussex were not your average thrill seekers or devotees of disaster tourism. Stumbling\
  \ past mounds of rubble still cluttering the sidewalks and photographing galvanised\
  \ roofing sheets that were wrapped like bows around what coconut tree trunks remained\
  \ standing, their evident emotions struck me. They questioned me on how quickly\
  \ the lush vegetation seemed to have rebounded, as observed from their ship\u2019\
  s deck while entering port. Putting down my briefcase, I assured them that things\
  \ were getting back to normal. People had now stopped bursting into tears in the\
  \ middle of streets, offices and shops, trembling from the ongoing post traumatic\
  \ shock. The incessant drone of diesel generators, with their attendant noxious\
  \ fumes, was being replaced by the more customary tunes of Soca and Reggae music\
  \ blaring from roadside loudspeakers. Despite the collapsed embankments and the\
  \ dank whiff of rotten bedding and swollen furniture piled up outside of roofless\
  \ homes, people were banding together; local \u2018Belongers\u2019, coloured \u2018\
  Down-Islanders\u2019, Caucasian \u2018Expats\u2019, short term Government consultants\
  \ like me \u2013 everyone was tapping into new reserves of communal unity to recover\
  \ and rebuild. From Vincentian electricians to Caymanian police, various stakeholders\
  \ were helping. And yes, the hills were still sculpted. The outlying islands were\
  \ still breathtaking. The beaches were still picturesque; the waters, still turquoise.\
  \ This was still a paradise.\n\nThen, glancing at my own barely salvaged Rolex,\
  \ I asked Martha why they were so intent on visiting the Gardens, which I knew had\
  \ been obliterated. As her eyes glistened with tears, Garrett answered, \u201CThirty-five\
  \ years ago, I proposed to Martha in those very Gardens. They mean a lot to us.\u201D\
  \n\nMortified by my own prejudices and assumptions, I loosened my jacket and tie,\
  \ unpinned my neatly coiffed dreadlocks, and told them I would carry them there\
  \ myself. The meeting could wait\u2026"
