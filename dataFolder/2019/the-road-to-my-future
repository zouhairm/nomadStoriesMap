Text: "I am laden down with a liter of homemade wine, a box of chocolates and half\
  \ a hundredweight of homegrown dill and tarragon. These are my current host's gifts\
  \ to my new hosts. Perhaps they hope to sweeten the deal for the people I will be\
  \ living with for two years? I am traveling more than 200 kilometers south of Ararat,\
  \ to the city of Goris in Syunik marz. Syunik is the narrowest part of Armenia,\
  \ pinched between Azerbaijan, Nagorno- Karabakh and Iran. Goris is where I will\
  \ live for the next two years. \n\nI am traveling with Lilit, who will help me fit\
  \ in in my new city and new role. She looks like she could be Isabella Rossellini\u2019\
  s daughter\u2013 heart-shaped face, high cheekbones, almond skin and sleek dark\
  \ hair. She speaks Hayeren, Russian, French and perfect English. She has a Masters\
  \ in Linguistics and specializes in Germanic Philology. It is all rather humbling.\
  \ \n\nLilit arranged a taxi for our journey and my heart lept when I saw it was\
  \ a nearly new Mercedes. It had tinted windows. Would it also have air-conditioning\
  \ and leather seats? It did not. There are now four people squashed in the car,\
  \ plus the driver. Two women are at least my size and are clutching hefty holdalls.\
  \ I am sitting behind the driver, who has long legs. Poor Lilit is sitting on the\
  \ hump in the middle of the back seat. That\u2019s the price you pay for being young\
  \ and slim. \n\nWe stop for gas and everyone gets out of the car and stands well\
  \ back. Cars here run on natural gas, held in a tank in the trunk or under the chassis.\
  \ The gas is both very cheap and very volatile. It is hot, dusty, and dangerous:\
  \ a sort of concrete hell where employees must crouch low like Caliban to fuel the\
  \ cars. The mouths of the gas tanks are low, close to the exhaust. \n\nFull up,\
  \ the car snakes slowly into the mountains. Rock lovers should definitely plan a\
  \ trip to Armenia. There is shist, there is scree. There are drumlins and u-shaped\
  \ valleys hollowed by glaciers. We are climbing steeply when a car coming the other\
  \ way honks. We do a u-turn on a hairpin bend (I must compliment our driver on his\
  \ clutch control) and stop. Everyone piles out. The people in the other car walk\
  \ towards us smiling. I have no idea what is going on. It turns out one of the other\
  \ car\u2019s passengers is to be a colleague of mine in my new office. She was on\
  \ her way to Yerevan  and wanted to say hello. We exchange warm words in English.\
  \ I was too confused to remember anything in Armenian. I look forward to getting\
  \ to know Anna better on firmer, flatter ground. \n\nWe pass several hundred sheep\
  \ and lambs, a donkey and some goats being herded along the road by a young man\
  \ in a Ferrari baseball cap, jeans and a rip-off Real Madrid jersey. \n\nNow there\
  \ are vine terraces and I begin to fantasize about stopping for some dolma and a\
  \ glass of local red. We do stop, but only so one of my fellow travelers can check\
  \ on the chickens she has stashed in the trunk: a dozen pullets squabbling in a\
  \ hot, dry cardboard box. And to think I was worried about whether my herbs would\
  \ make the journey unharmed\u2026\n\n\nA few hundred more sheep, this time shepherded\
  \ by an old man wearing a bomber jacket emblazoned with the Bentley logo. As the\
  \ herd passes, a old woman with thinning hair dyed an unkind  red-purple hurries\
  \ on to the road with a witches broom to sweep up evidence of the sheep. \n\nThe\
  \ road is good all the way. Did the Soviets build it or has the Armenian government\
  \ scraped together the funding to ensure a straight run to and from Nagorno-Karabakh?\
  \  Either way, I am grateful. \n\n\nThe road dips and bends. My ears pop.  We turn\
  \ a corner and suddenly see a town built on the steep sides of a deep crevasse.\
  \ Shining tin roofs glint in the sun. I am home."
