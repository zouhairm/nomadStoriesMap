Text: "\u201CIt is snowing!!\u201D I heard a loud cry from the neighbouring room.\
  \ I was a bit suspicious. As I peered outside I saw little white cotton balls falling\
  \ down. What a sight!! This was my first winter trip to Spiti valley. Situated at\
  \ an altitude of 2670 m from the sea level, Reckong Peo is one of my favourites\
  \ travel destinations. Surrounded by majestic mountains, it is an easy get away\
  \ from Delhi (570 kms) or Shimla (235 kms). It gets crowded with tourists during\
  \ the summer months. Winters are harsh with temperatures dipping to -40 degrees\
  \ Celsius. However, I personally thought winter was a perfect time to enjoy the\
  \ deep powdered beauty of Spiti valley. \n\nAfter a long cycling program in the\
  \ hot and dry part of India, Spiti valley in Himachal was a spontaneous decision\
  \ for me. I packed my bags and took a bus from Delhi to Reckong Peo. I hadn\u2019\
  t planned my trip and thought I will work it out on the go. Luckily I found a decent\
  \ guesthouse in Reckong Peo, where the gatekeeper agreed to let me stay. Travelling\
  \ by local bus is the best way to feel the pulse of the place. Next day morning,\
  \ I woke up thinking I will go Kalpa, a small town 8 kms from Reckong Peo. As I\
  \ walked out of the guesthouse, it was a lovely sight to watch the entire place\
  \ snowed in. However, when I went to the bus stand, I decided to head towards Kaza.\
  \ Local buses are the lifeline of these places connecting small villages situated\
  \ along the way. Drivers are used to the narrow and sometimes dangerous roads passing\
  \ through stiff mountains. As we go ahead, we have to get used to less oxygen. Walking\
  \ small distances and drinking hot tea at regular intervals helped me throughout\
  \ the journey. We halted at a place called Spello for tea. As we were about to start,\
  \ just after 500 meters, there was a landslide. The driver announced that we cannot\
  \ go ahead and quickly turned backed the bus. Landslides are a common occurrence\
  \ in this area. We were told that we can either halt at Spello for the night and\
  \ wait for the morning bus the next day (which if we are lucky will go ahead) or\
  \ go back to Reckong Peo in the same bus. I decided to take my chance and stay back\
  \ at Spello. A river called Sutlej flows nearby and I set out for a walk with my\
  \ camera. \n\nLuckily, next day morning roads were cleared and I got in the bus\
  \ going towards Kaza. The road is populated with scenic landscape making it a wonderful\
  \ journey. There were just five people in the entire bus and the driver and his\
  \ assistant were friendly and started chatting with us. They had been working here\
  \ for more than 15 years. We talked about the winter time in Spiti valley, village\
  \ life, how people go about their lives, local food and much more. The driver offered\
  \ me local food and guided me regarding stay options in Tabo and Nako villages ahead.\
  \ During winters, it is difficult to find accommodation as most guesthouses and\
  \ homestays are closed for the season. It is a good idea to enquire for which stay\
  \ options are open at bus stations. The bus stopped at Kaza. As I stepped out of\
  \ the bus, it felt as if I was freezing. Temperature had dipped to minus 25. Luckily,\
  \ I had purchased extra woollens at Reckong Peo for the travel. Kaza is the biggest\
  \ settlement in Spiti. It possesses a distinctive Buddhist culture. As I chatted\
  \ with the locals at the bus station, I got to know of a fun festival being held\
  \ there in the evening. I headed towards finding a homestay. A few days more at\
  \ Kaza will help get used to the cold and then I plan to go ahead to visit Kye Monsatry,\
  \ Kibber, and Hikkim. Meanwhile time for another cup of tea!"
