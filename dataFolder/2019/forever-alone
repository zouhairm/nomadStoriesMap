Text: "It is hard to be alone and no companion to travel. When you grow up, your friends\
  \ and relatives have different duties to accomplish such as parenting (including\
  \ dogs). Those who are single have other priorities but you. \n\nYou have to admit\
  \ that you are not the adventure boy or girl to travel with. More if you are the\
  \ kind of person who enjoys museums, bookstores, restaurants but night l\xEDfe.\
  \ \n\nSo the only companion that I could get was myself and a ticket to Canc\xFA\
  n, Mexico, with the idea to know the wonders of earth that the ancient Mayan culture\
  \ offers, and keeping in mind that may be, after my break up, love was there.\n\n\
  What I remember the most, was the hostel that I booked. It was the perfect place\
  \ for \u201Cforever alone\u201D people like me, with the same taste and trying to\
  \ make a stop of their lives. \n\nSuddenly, I was doing many things that I never\
  \ expected from that trip. \n\nOne of many was that I celebrated christmas surronded\
  \ by many people with different nationalities and ages, like family, but each one\
  \ far away from home.  People who still are connected with me, at least, online.\
  \ \n\nDancing, surfing and enjoying myself were other activities that I never expected\
  \ to do.\n\nLove? I haven\u2019t found it yet. For that reason I keep enjoying myself\
  \ when travelling. \n\nI have learnt that I just need my ticket to fly, my passport\
  \ and make decitions about my next journey. I am not afraid to travel alone anymore.\
  \ \n\nAnd when you are back home, as the Brazilian singer Bebel Gilberto\u2019s\
  \ song \u201Cjust close your eyes, and you\u2019ll never be alone\u201D hundreds\
  \ of memories are with me to make me smile and face my everyday life.\nWanderlust"
