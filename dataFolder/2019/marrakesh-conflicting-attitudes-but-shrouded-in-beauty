Text: "It's the middle of the day and we're taking the minibus back to the hotel from\
  \ the Jemaa el-Fnaa; a speeding moped carrying a man without a helmet holding what\
  \ appeared to be a\_large satellite dish twice the size of him\_takes over us. No-one\
  \ bats an eyelid. This is the city where men selling human teeth at the side of\
  \ the road is seen as normal. You could be forgiven for thinking Marrakesh has an\
  \ incredibly laid back attitude towards life- yet this is a city where haggling\
  \ is a way of life and the street vendors can be very persistent, but welcoming\
  \ at the same time. \n\nTheir invitation of mint tea would be impolite to decline,\
  \ whether you like it or not. It is a Morrocan delicacy and offered in most establishments\
  \ as a welcome gift or as an aperitif in a country where alcohol consumption is\
  \ limited. However, they still have a way to go before the coffee wave that has\
  \ hit the UK hits Morocco- the Moroccan take on the 'Americano' appears to be a\
  \ shot of espresso in a metal milk jug, hot milk in a teapot and an empty cup on\
  \ the side. It was certainly the most inventive way I have been presented an americano.\n\
  \nBeyond the backstreets are a plethora of incredible eating establishments- one\
  \ of which housing the best lasagne I have ever tasted- in Morocco! \u2018Pepe Nero\u2019\
  \_may be difficult to find, but is well worth the search. In a similar vein, \u2018\
  Limoni\u2019\_gave a new meaning to 'a haven from the masses' as it truly made you\
  \ forget the contrast of some of the poverty seen in the alleyways, despite being\
  \ led there by two unscrupulous teenagers. If you want a more authentic dining experience\
  \ then try out the many street vendors and beautiful bakeries often disguised as\
  \ greengrocers- or even try experimenting with the many spice souks yourselves!\n\
  \n\LCleanliness on the streets may not pass the British standard, yet looks really\
  \ can be deceiving, as when you walk through the inconspicuous front doors the decor\
  \ is overwhelming and Moroccans really take pride in their own establishments. The\
  \ juxtaposition of clean interiors versus dirty exteriors and laid back driving\
  \ & health attitudes versus forceful vendors and strict religious beliefs is fascinating\
  \ to observe and makes Marrakesh a destination with many layers to unravel.\n\n\
  One way of voyaging through Morocco is via donkey, as many of the locals seemed\
  \ to. However, we opted for the more modern approach of a taxi which was reasonably\
  \ priced. If you are feeling brave, you could opt for a camel ride- however, be\
  \ prepared for a numb backside after spending an hour on a camel hump!\n\nMopeds\
  \ are a popular form of transport with locals too (a contrast from donkeys other\
  \ locals use!) but be prepared to have your wits about you if you wish to engage\
  \ with every other form of transport Marrakesh has to offer.\n\nSouks are the obvious\
  \ tourist traps, but well worth a visit and if you are good at haggling, then you\
  \ could get a good bargain. Naturally, you cannot avoid a trip to Jemma El-fnaa\
  \ when visiting Marrakesh, as it comes alive in the evening with storytellers, snake\
  \ charmers, belly dancers and much more!\n\nLa maison de la photograhie\_is the\
  \ obvious choice for exploring the history of Marrakesh and if you don't like having\
  \ to read about history too much then this is ideal as you can take a photographic\
  \ tour of the city which doesn't require too much concentration! Though, it is strikingly\
  \ remarkable that many of the images from the 19th and early 20th century look rather\
  \ typical of Marrakesh in 2019.\n\nA city so proud of its culture and past, yet\
  \ hidden to everyone apart from the most discerning traveller, Marrakech is a true\
  \ \u2018leap into the unknown\u2019."
