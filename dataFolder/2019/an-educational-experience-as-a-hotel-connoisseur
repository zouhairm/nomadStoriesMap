Text: "During nearly two-month-long winter vacation, I travelled alone to two popular\
  \ tourist cities in China; Chengdu & Xi'an rather than staying at home being idle\_\
  about.\nAt the end of January, I decided to leave for Chengdu as a connoisseur for\
  \ a youth hotel in Chengdu. They will provide me with free accommodation and meals,\
  \ and I need to faithfully feedback the environment and ambience of this Youth Hotel;\
  \ submit an original itinerary full of creativity and individuality after the journey\
  \ accordingly. I was so perplexed and puzzled for what should I do as a connoisseur\
  \ at first. What's worse, it is also the first time that I have travelled to such\
  \ a distant city on my own.\nIn view of my departure time is approaching the Spring\
  \ Festival (2019's Spring Festival is at February 5th), I couldn\u2019t get the\
  \ passenger tickets so I finally decided to took a 27-hour green train to Chengdu\
  \ by myself. The horrible scenes of Spring Festival travel rush, which can solely\
  \ be observed from television or newspapers, became my omnibearing recept on this\
  \ occasion. In the carriage, all the migrant workers were sitting densely and chatting\
  \ about their various work and colorful life in their joint dialect. Though their\
  \ clothes were shabby and dowdy, the enjoyment of returning home over their faces\
  \ does resonate powerfully with me. Their luggage, large and small, not only carries\
  \ the fruitful harvest of this year, but also shows a passionate heart of reunion.\
  \ Their life\_at\_the\_bottom\_are worth further thinking about. We should cherish\
  \ what we have, live every day contentedly, and do as much as we can to make what\
  \ we do truly meaningful.\nThen I took the high-speed railway and the subway after\
  \ getting off the train. It took me 30 hours altogether to reach Chengdu. Attractions\
  \ in Chengdu are concentrated, so I could make my itinerary more flexible according\
  \ to my preferences. On the first day, I chose to visit the three major exhibition\
  \ halls: museums, art galleries and libraries with the hope of quickly understanding\
  \ the cultural connotation and urban vitality of Chengdu through these cultural\
  \ input. I combined lanes and alleys holding the most captivating scenes with historical\
  \ sites to help me feel the charm of Chengdu more closely in the next few days.\
  \ Although it was my first attempt to live alone in the youth hotel, I met quite\
  \ a lot of sincere friends within only 5 days. All the difficulties I encountered\
  \ on my own journey have been overcome. Some of them were solved by the means I\
  \ found by myself, and the others were finally resolved with the help of the warmhearted\
  \ ultimately.\nLast but not least, I would like to say that there may be some things\
  \ that you are afraid to try on account of your ignorance and incomprehension, but\
  \ at the same time, you will lose the opportunity to explore a new world. Therefore,\
  \ just take the step bravely like me! Knowing little of travel experiencer, but\
  \ I still start my trip in the light of my deep love for travelling and perfectly\
  \ complete the mission given to me in the end. \nAs I participated in the application\
  \ for this writing scholarship, it simply plays the role of an exploration of the\
  \ unknown field or a promotion of myself on a deeper level. It must be a progress\
  \ in action and sublimation of spirit as long as you make a simple change from now\
  \ on!\n\nI am Lily. I am really eager to learn and good at learning."
