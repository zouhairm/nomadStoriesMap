Text: "Journey Down the Amazon River\nby Edward C. Davis IV\n\nIn January 2004, I\
  \ escaped another frigid New York winter for a 200-day Brazilian adventure. Landing\
  \ in Sao Paolo, I feared the worse. Although it had been two years since my last\
  \ Portuguese lesson, I had little trouble communicating. Body language revealed\
  \ a sense of distrust for my black body, and my youthful face. Perhaps, I was a\
  \ black boy, escaping the grit of the favelas with a stolen American passport. \n\
  \nArriving in the Amazonian modernized and developed capital of Manaus, I never\
  \ expected to find McDonald\u2019s, motorcycle factories, and a shopping mall. \
  \ When orientation in my teaching program ended, I took a 6-hour bus ride to the\
  \ village of Itacoatiara along bumpy craters on the only road to my new home.  Along\
  \ the route, burning fields welcomed my arrival, while ash descended from the sky\
  \ like acid rain. My eyes witnessed climate change in the very moment forestland\
  \ became cattle ranches and soya bean farms for global export. Teaching English\
  \ in Itacoatiara proved peaceful and serene.  The Amazonian rubber boom overtook\
  \ Itacoatiara over a century before I arrived. The mixture of indigenous, African\
  \ and Portuguese culture was a true testament to the diversity of the town, region,\
  \ and country. In my first months teaching, short boat rides upriver brought me\
  \ face to face with the true beauty of Amazonia.  Excursions to Uricuritiba or Presidente\
  \ Figueiredo would not compare to the ultimate journey through Amazonas\u2014a pilgrimage\
  \ to Parintins.\n\nWhile the rest of Brazil celebrates the carnival season, Amazonia\
  \ spends February preparing for the June festival in Parintins.  Everyone urged\
  \ me go to Parintins to experience a festa da boi bumba. Along the way, a parade\
  \ of small boats and large ships carried thousands of pilgrims for the party of\
  \ the year.  Originally a West African harvest feast in present-day Mali, boi bumba\
  \ arrived in Amazonia as a ritual of syncretized or blended traditions.  Enslaved\
  \ Afro-Brazilian added elements to preexisting indigenous folklore.  As such, the\
  \ African bulls became Caprichoso, represented by a blue star, and Garantido, who\
  \ is represented by a red heart. As one part of the legend goes, an enslaved woman\
  \ asked her enslaved husband for the heart of her master\u2019s beloved bull.  He\
  \ escapes from his master and kills the bull of his wife\u2019s master, only to\
  \ face death. Miraculously, however, the bull rises from the dead, without a heart,\
  \ and lives on victoriously full of courage. Anti-Black elements permeated the performances,\
  \ as the only time people embrace Indigenous heritage.\n\nThe Summer Solstice of\
  \ 2004 filled the bumbodrimo, a stadium constructed specifically for the annual\
  \ event. Like samba schools in Rio, special clubs from across Amazonas perform elaborate\
  \ dances in ornate costumes, accompanied by a live performance of previously released\
  \ songs.  In the months leading up to the event, soundtracks of the competing Caprichoso\
  \ and Garantido camps could be heard playing in every bar and restaurant.  By June,\
  \ not only did many people know the words to the songs, but they could also dance\
  \ along with the performers in the center of the arena. On several nights I was\
  \ on national television, according to my students back in Itacoatiara. On each\
  \ night, a different stranger walked up to my friends and sold me front row tickets\
  \ for less than US$10.  \n\nUltimately, however, my 5-day stay in Parintins ended,\
  \ as I needed to return to my job in Itacoatiara. Keeping on schedule, I arrived\
  \ at the dock two hours before departure. Unfortunately, the boat left the harbor\
  \ during the final performance in the bumbodrimo., with my hammock aboard. I found\
  \ a captain willing to stop in Itacoatiara. Nearly 12 hours into our journey, the\
  \ engine died, finding ourselves shipwrecked. The Brazilian navy attached two floating\
  \ vessels to our ship, spinning us towards an island where we would remain for 50\
  \ hours. The captain of the ship purchased cows and chickens from the handful of\
  \ residents. Slaughtered cow blood dripped all over the bench and table that had\
  \ been my bed. Soon, I became seasick and wondered, at 21-years-old, how I would\
  \ survive."
