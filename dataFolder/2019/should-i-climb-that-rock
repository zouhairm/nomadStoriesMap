Text: "Traveling might sound like a dream for some of us, specially when you think\
  \ priorities are elsewhere. But, what if we need to get our priorities sorted? The\
  \ first time I travelled by myself and payed the entire trip from by pocket was\
  \ to Vancouver, Canada. I chose it because some friends have gone a couple months\
  \ before and they told me it was amazing and also because Canada sounds quite safe\
  \ for a woman traveling alone.\n\nThe trip took a week but the thing I wasn't expecting\
  \ to find was to understand all that people climbing mountains and getting some\
  \ sort of epiphany. I had traveled before but never like this, all by myself in\
  \ a country I had never been before and with a plan by me for me. It was incredible,\
  \ I tend to be a little bit shy but I met many people in that short time and had\
  \ the time of my life.\n\nOne of the places I visited was Deep Cove and when I get\
  \ there I realized how hungry I was. It was almost 6 pm and the cafes and stores\
  \ were closed. I wanted to hike all my way up to the Quarry Rock, a perfect spot\
  \ for pictures I've seen on the internet, but I was so exhausted I wasn't sure wether\
  \ to do it or just to give up. I had been daydreaming about that trip for months\
  \ in the office and I was not going to chicken out so I started that journey.\n\n\
  It's a half an hour walk through the forest, it's pretty safe, you don't need an\
  \ extraordinary physical condition and believe me it's totally worth it. I've never\
  \ been in a forest with that amazing smell, probably it is not what you try to perceive\
  \ at first instance but that detail was mesmerizing. For me it was the smell of\
  \ Christmas, of the nativity scene decorations of my family and some type of incense.\
  \ The forest was so beautiful I felt trapped in the middle of a fantasy movie or\
  \ video game.\n\nWhen it started to get dark, I started to worry. I wanted to see\
  \ the sunset from the top of Quarry Rock and I wasn't sure I was going to make it.\
  \ I thought of giving up quite some times, not because it was a heavy climbing but\
  \ I was hungry and tired, so I was worried I would pass out. Suddenly, after some\
  \ more minutes I could see light between the trees. I walked a little further and\
  \ I saw the beautiful lake of Deep Cove, the forest all around and at the distance\
  \ Downtown Vancouver. The sky was starting to get pink and purple and the wind refreshed\
  \ my face.\n\nI took some pictures and I just sit there contemplating the view and\
  \ I thought that I would had missed that if I had given up. I even made a fluffy\
  \ friend, a little dog was cold and tried to get warm with my body. Her owner was\
  \ apologizing but I was ok, how can you say no to a cute little puppy? After a few\
  \ more minutes I climbed down and half way it got really dark. Thanks to my high\
  \ technology cell phone light I didn't fell and broke my neck. \n\nIt might sound\
  \ like simple walking excursion and it was, but after being ten hours a day in an\
  \ office, six days a week, walking around in a Canadian forest was magical. Simply\
  \ by daring to do that small trek I realized so many things of myself and my life.\
  \ I think that's the best part of traveling, because you don't have to go far, you\
  \ don't have to take a plane from Mexico City to Vancouver like me just to realize\
  \ you are giving up when things go dark or difficult. You just need to be a little\
  \ more patient and you will see the light at the end of the trail."
