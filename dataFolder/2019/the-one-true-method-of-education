Text: "A singer, a movie star, a Guinness record holder, a criminal, a rapist and\
  \ yet a \u201CSpiritual Guru\u201D \u2013 Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is a self-styled\
  \ godman with over 60 million devoted followers. Little did I know that I\u2019\
  ll be at an ashram listening to him preach about the \u201Cpath to truth\u201D \u2013\
  \ for what I\u2019d thought would be a meditation trip.\n\n \u201CAn event held\
  \ yearly to teach people the one true method of meditation by a spiritual Guru in\
  \ Sirsa; one of the oldest places in North India located in the Indian State of\
  \ Haryana\u201D said my Indian friend who organized the trip. \n\nTwo months later\u2026\
  \n\nWide brown eyes staring at us, women caressing our skin, children giggling as\
  \ we pass by, I found myself one of five tourists standing among thousands of locals\
  \ at the Dera Sacha Sauda ashram \u2013 a powerful sect headed by Gurmeet and meant\
  \ to offer \u201Cselfless services\u201D through donations made by its supporters.\
  \ \n\nAfter passing through the ashram\u2019s security, two guides escort us through\
  \ the crowds to our spot in the women\u2019s section at the front row nearest to\
  \ the main platform where an antique sofa on a 4 step higher little stage lies in\
  \ the center. They hand us five headsets to connect to an English translator, and\
  \ ask us to wait for few minutes before the Guru arrives. I sit on the ground, and\
  \ all that I can see is pretty faces happy to see foreigners in their humble town.\
  \ As I try to find a comfortable seating position, I feel someone gently pulling\
  \ a lock of my curly hair. I turn around and see a young beautiful girl with long\
  \ braided hair. I try to ask for her name, but she replies with shy smiles. I then\
  \ remember that few people here speak English.\n\nAfter two hours of waiting \u2013\
  \ amid the penurious conditions of the space \u2013 a distant roaring sound of a\
  \ car\u2019s engine fills the air of the massive hall. I look towards the ashram\u2019\
  s front side arches, and a bright green Porsche Cayenne driving at high speed pulls\
  \ the breaks hard as it approaches the central platform. Four men with snipers get\
  \ off the car, securing the way, and slowly comes out Gurmeet in his flashy patterned\
  \ clothes and colorful turban on his black frizzy hair. As he arrives to his throne,\
  \ he gently brings his palms together bending over to do the Anjali Mudra greeting.\
  \ He then rests on the couch crossing his legs and starts his speech. Stunned by\
  \ the shocking scene, I firmly press the headset\u2019s cups onto my ears to hear\
  \ him talk about his principles in life that he commands his devotees to follow.\n\
  \nCurious to visualize people\u2019s expressions as he speaks, I raise my head and\
  \ see women covering the parting-line of their black hair with red Sindoor, sitting\
  \ cross-legged on the cold surface of the concrete ground while carrying their babies\
  \ in between their laps, listening carefully to the Guru\u2019s words. On one side\
  \ of the hall, thousands of unfortunate people who live poverty, oppression, and\
  \ insecurity are looking for answers in his words; and on the other side, the \u201C\
  Guru of Bling\u201D in his ornate jewelry and fancy dress is preaching about humanitarianism.\
  \ \n\nHe then ends his speech with the \u201CNaam Method of Meditation\u201D which\
  \ is an ordered collection of words that shall be chanted regularly to achieve one\u2019\
  s own consciousness. It\u2019s the one true method of meditation taught only by\
  \ a true Guru. A \u201CTrue Guru\u201D that calls himself the \u201CRockstar Baba\u201D\
  , rides oversized motorbikes, has a passion for Bollywood, and wears custom-made\
  \ expensive clothes. \n\nHe eventually goes back to his Porsche, where his driver\
  \ awaits. Engine at full throttle, they drive backwards and the four bodyguards\
  \ sprint after the car. Everyone starts cheering, feeling empowered, hopeful, and\
  \ strong to face tomorrow. \n\nAs I try to get back on my feet, I feel my hips numb\
  \ \u2013 though nothing compared to the numbness in my brain. Walking towards the\
  \ exit, I realize that I came for a spiritual awakening experience and left with\
  \ a culture awakening lesson. A lesson which taught me that travel is the one true\
  \ method of education."
