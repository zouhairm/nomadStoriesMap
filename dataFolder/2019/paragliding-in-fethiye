Text: "A building sense of anticipation, an adrenaline-infused pounding heart, and\
  \ a literal leap into the unknown. After a forty-minute bus ride up Babadag Mountain,\
  \ I felt mentally prepared enough to embark upon my paragliding adventure - something\
  \ I hadn't really considered until the last few days. When arriving in Fethiye,\
  \ the azure blue of the lagoon and the promise of serene sea turtles gliding through\
  \ it, was enough to convince me to sign up almost immediately. Tomorrow's activity\
  \ was booked. \nAfter some careful deliberation on the way up, I decided I wanted\
  \ to go first. I figured there were only so many people I could watch run off a\
  \ cliff and didn't want to risk losing my nerve. The guides informed us that there\
  \ would be 'no falling' - which I was relieved about - as the air currents pick\
  \ you up and lift you away from the mountain. Exactly what I needed to hear, as\
  \ my breath was quickening, and my palms were starting to sweat. After the briefing,\
  \ we paired up with our guides and spaced ourselves out across the side of the mountain.\
  \ Secure in my harness, I watched my guide spread out the parachute behind me. Eager\
  \ to digest any last-minute instructions, my heart skipped a beat as he apologetically\
  \ explained that we would go last. He was running the show and had to make sure\
  \ everyone else took off safely. Not what I had hoped for, but I nodded agreeably,\
  \ assuring him it was fine. The wind conditions were just right, and all the takeoffs\
  \ were successful. When our turn came, I sat awkwardly on his knee before beginning\
  \ an uncoordinated jog down the side of the mountain. It was only a few minutes\
  \ before my feet no longer touched the ground and I could relax into the seat of\
  \ my harness. As promised, the air currents gently lifted us up, until we were far\
  \ above both the lagoon and the mountain. I marvelled at how far away the other\
  \ para-gliders were already, their multicoloured parachutes easily visible against\
  \ a backdrop of clear blue sky. I found myself surprised at the height we gained,\
  \ as I had imagined just running off the clifftop and sailing gently to the ground.\
  \ The day was perfect - warm, sunny and clear. The views over Oludeniz Beach and\
  \ Blue Lagoon were awe-inspiring and helped to quench my eternal thirst for summer.\
  \ My guide asked whether I had ever touched a cloud, as the sky around us briefly\
  \ turned white and we sailed effortlessly through one. My arms outstretched, we\
  \ soared through the deliciously fresh air, feeling liberated. He taught me to steer,\
  \ leaning gently to one side and using the ropes. At our highest point, he asked\
  \ whether I wanted to learn some tricks. Of course I did! So on our way down, we\
  \ swung side to side like a pendulum and somersaulted through the air. He managed\
  \ to capture it all on GoPro which I was stoked about. After a few rounds of tricks\
  \ I was starting to feel nauseated, so focused my attention on the calming blue\
  \ water beneath me. It helped. As we swooped down over the lagoon, I could clearly\
  \ see the outlines of the turtles gliding beneath its surface. I was stunned by\
  \ the clarity and beauty of it all. It was a powerful view, I felt I had never seen\
  \ a landscape so serene - it somehow looked untouched, even the small village by\
  \ the beach looked as though it were meant to be there.\nNearing the end of our\
  \ descent, we skimmed across the gentle waves rolling in, swiftly approaching the\
  \ terracotta roofs of the village. My guide emphasised the importance of continuing\
  \ to run once our feet hit the ground. He directed us towards a small area of grass,\
  \ which was rapidly approaching. I took heed of his advice, and didn't fall over.\
  \ It was strange to be on the ground again, and my nausea hadn't completely subsided.\
  \ He took some more photos of us and I thanked him delightedly. I lay down in the\
  \ grass, thrilled with what I had just experienced, and content to soak up nature\
  \ for a while."
