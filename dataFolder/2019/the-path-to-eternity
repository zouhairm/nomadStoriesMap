Text: "Singapore was my first abroad trip. I was super excited as, as i was selected\
  \ for the trip by my school in a Global immersion programme during my high school\
  \ years. I was really happy as many of my school friends also accompanied me. I\
  \ am from India. And as we know It is a developing nation, so we all were really\
  \ curious and eager to reach there.\nWe caught our flight from Hyderabad international\
  \ airport , and we reached Singapore the next early morning. We all could feel that\
  \ we were in a different country. The Singapore airport was huge from inside. The\
  \ whole country was full of fantasy , and it was like a dream.\nWe all had the same\
  \ motive to travel the whole country , take a lots of pictures , and take back as\
  \ many good memories as possible.\nOur motive was clean and clear, we wanted to\
  \ explore the city/country fully and enjoy the trip.\nThe first few days ,our school\
  \ authority took us to some of the top ranked universities in the world (which was\
  \ mandatory) , such as the Nanyang technological University and the National University\
  \ of Singapore. The university campus was amazing , there were students from all\
  \ over the world .there were people who all belonged to different families, caste,\
  \ cultures etc. I was really happy to interact to students from all over the world.\
  \ I made many friends in NTU and NUS.\nThe first few days were good, but we all\
  \ wanted something better and extraordinary. The third day we went Marina bay sands\
  \ , which is one of the most expensive and attractive hotel in the world. It has\
  \ an open pool in the top most floor of hotel.\nI was really jolly at that point\
  \ of time...I was thinking about how  did a small country such as Singapore develop\
  \ this fast and in an amazing way. Few days earlier Singapore was the first smart\
  \ country in the world , isn't that amazing.\nI wanted to know more about the country\
  \ and explore more , so with some of my friends I went to the regular streets of\
  \ Singapore and interacted with random strangers , some were the residents , some\
  \ were foreign travelers,who all shared some of there personal experience with us,\
  \ and finally the day ended well.\nThe next fine day was an important one, as all\
  \ of us planned to go \"universal studios\". The universal studies in Singapore\
  \ is one of the largest in the world and it was extremely beautiful. We saw a lot\
  \ of Indians out there , who all came to visit Singapore with family and friends.\
  \ That fine day ,I came to know that the number of indian tourist to Singapore was\
  \ way ahead comparing to the rest of the world. We all (class friends and seniors)\
  \ experienced and had a hell lot of fun at universal studios. There were too many\
  \ water rides as well as amusement park rides at universal studios, we spent the\
  \ whole day there,tried different types of food , went for shopping in there watched\
  \ many street shows and events.\nWe seriously enjoyed the day a lot, I never knew\
  \ that universal studios would be such a fun and happy place for tourists. By the\
  \ end of the day we all were really exhausted and tired, but every thing was worth,\
  \ as we enjoyed a lot.\nAs the days were passing we all were feeling kind of bad,\
  \ as we all have to leave this beautiful place and go back to India , (India is\
  \ beautiful too ) :)\nIn those last few days we all went to an island , Sentosa,\
  \ which was in the outskirts of Singapore, where we all ,also went for a night Safari.\
  \ In the Safari we all got in van and travelled the jungle and saw many animals\
  \ in the open.\nSo finally as days passed away....in this beautiful part of the\
  \ journey, the saddest part came ,the end of the journey.\nIn the end I noticed\
  \ , nothing worked according to our motives, we didn't travel the whole Singapore\
  \ , we didn't capture much pictures of many moments ,but I believe we all lived\
  \ every moment of this journey.\nAnd found the path to eternity from nowhere.\n\
  \           \n                                                                 \
