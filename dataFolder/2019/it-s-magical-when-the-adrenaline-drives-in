Text: "This story is not about any chemical drugs which induces adrenaline, But in\
  \ a way it is a drug and it is dangerous and the result is instant death or severe.\n\
  We had  seen a lot of people are awesome videos in the social media ,I know we had\
  \ goosebumps.\nI am not sure whether my story gives you one.\n\nIt was in munnar\
  \ top station in Kerala.\nI had a very intense study session , clearing all  my\
  \ backpapers on my last year in college.\nI just wanted to get some fresh air ,meet\
  \ new people, do some trekking . I called my friends to go and they call me back\
  \ as 'psycho.\nI don't  know why they make that call.\nI set out my journey alone\
  \ , I used public transport which was money saving but to exploit everywhere I recommend\
  \  a two stoke Yamaha( it drinks too much petrol ofcourse) . I didn't  used any\
  \ maps because it was near less than 200km from my college. I reached their early\
  \ morning in the munnar bus stand and I forgot to tell you that the bus was full\
  \ and I was sitting on the floor shivering all night. I had to take 4 buses to reach\
  \ munnar and didn't got direct hill station bus. When I reached the munnar stand\
  \  there was taxi facility was there, bus was there and I wasn't ready to wait anywhere\
  \ , I walked slowly through the early morning market of munnar smelling fresh fruits,flower\
  \ and hot snacks and tea. The problem started when i had a tea , I am a kind of\
  \ guys who really needs tea in ghe morning to write an easy bathroom story. I used\
  \ a restaurant bathroom. And I continued my walking ,I seen a board directing munnar\
  \ hill station 45km  but I just walked over  , I thought  I could  get some lift\
  \ on my way ,so that i can save some money and hoped I will find some characters\
  \ to talk.\nI walked about 4 km and I got a lift from a bike, he was going to the\
  \ church nearby and it was a small trip and we just exchanged our names a in the\
  \ end and he just wants to know why i  am alone and I  smiled and I continued my\
  \ walking then I got a Red omni van filled with fish from the coastal area and he\
  \ was on the way to hill station but I didn't  tell him thats my destination ,we\
  \ had discussion about his  business and I asked him about \"magic mushrooms \"\
  \   but deep down thats the quest of this journey was all about\U0001F609  and he\
  \ tell me about a dam,where in the morning, you pluck it and you can eat it .And\
  \ he dropped on that dam are and pointed me a mountain. I thanked him and continued\
  \ my walking towards dam ,it was open but no one around expect some horseride guys\
  \ who lives inside the premises of dam ,I went to the mountain area ,no one was\
  \ there I started looking for small pellets of mushrooms all over ,I didn't  got\
  \ any but found out some interesting insects ,small flowers, I wished i had a smart\
  \ phone atleast at that time with me to capture those amazing. While i was walking\
  \ I found my legs in a pit of mug and that pit seems interesting that it's the leg\
  \ print of an elephant and it was wet and seems fresh, Then I started to have a\
  \ little of adrenaline drive ,pumping my heart a little bit just say (90km/hr),I\
  \ looked around there was no one around, even no sounds too , I have a long way\
  \ back to the road and I telling myself inside if you found an animal do not  become\
  \ wild just be yourself and we can make a connection then I started walking towards\
  \ my road where I saw a large pack of elephants ,they l started starring me and\
  \ I keep my eyes on to them, and they all seems not interested in me and they started\
  \ minding their on business and I think they were saying \"hey pal look a psycho\
  \ starring at us\"\n\nThankyou\nSUNOJ JOLLY"
