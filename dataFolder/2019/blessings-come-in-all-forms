Text: "A blessing in disguise when I was laid off...One always wonders having suffered\
  \ three in less than 10.  All promised stability and growth potential but no one\
  \ could predict the industries and the economy.  After this final one I was able\
  \ to finally find the much needed balance through the passion of travel and a carefree\
  \ attitude.  Something I never truly experienced through other layoffs.  Maybe a\
  \ renewed sense of self and worth and/or a bit of confidence and optimist in view\
  \ that something larger awaited me.  An opportunity presented itself in the form\
  \ of a golf trip to Scotland.  My true passion for the game and sport.  You might\
  \ say I live and breathe it.    \n\nFor someone who has never experienced international\
  \ travel, I was in awe of the landscape. I loved the people that I met and still\
  \ in contact with to date. A place I could see as home, as I assimilated with the\
  \ culture from the onset.  I always make connections whether traveling or just within\
  \ my own neighborhoods. A mere glimpse of the culture, foods, drink, golf.   Golfing\
  \ a new course in my travels is part of my bucketlist items. I even attended my\
  \ first Open and being up close to greatness in all its forms.  Once in a lifetime\
  \ experiences.  I was able to experience this and while it was way too short it\
  \ reminded me of lifestyle that I had envisioned.  Things happen for a reason...so\
  \ something definitely awaits me at the other end.\n\nWhile photos tell a story.\
  \  It's more of an interest to tell mine and leave a lasting imprint.  Whether it\
  \ amounts to an financial gain is secondary.  It really has become a center for\
  \ me .  Hope that I bring something unique upon my sharing. \n\nPersonal obligations\
  \ have since shifted my priorities.  A pay it forward mentality hoping to finally\
  \ shift my way.  Who knows where my next adventure will take me."
