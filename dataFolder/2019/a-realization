Text: "I thought I knew India. The bustling streets of New Delhi, traversed by cars,\
  \ motorcycles, and pedestrians alike, inhabited by panhandlers, sacred cows, and\
  \ stray dogs. That familiar odor: a blend of spices, incense, burnt oil, dust. The\
  \ bright colors of women's saris, the hollers of street vendors selling fruit from\
  \ rickshaws, teenagers sporting jeans with kurtas. Through my annual visits to this\
  \ mysterious yet familiar land, I thought I had seen it all. \nBut as I sat in the\
  \ backseat of a taxi, my stomach uneasy after driving through the winding, deserted\
  \ roads, I gazed at the picturesque Himalayan Mountains in the distance, and I knew\
  \ I was in for something new. \nFrom the start, I knew this trip would be different:\
  \ instead of visiting family and sightseeing, I would be living in an Ashram and\
  \ volunteering in villages near Sidhbari - a town situated in the foothills of the\
  \ Dhauladhar mountains, a short drive from where the fourteenth Dalai Lama lives.\
  \ On our first day, the five other volunteers and I walked for hours to reach the\
  \ village. We trudged through unkempt weeds, wearing our barely broken in walking\
  \ shoes, dressed in loose kurtas in an effort to blend in. Half way through the\
  \ journey, we pulled out our \"tiffins,\" filled with hand-made rotis and cooked\
  \ vegetables. Mala, one of the adult volunteers, passed around hand sanitizer and\
  \ we all squeezed out droplets - we didn't want to get sick - then stuffed ourselves\
  \ full. \nBefore I had left the U.S., I was weary of \"volunteerism\" and aware\
  \ of the dangers of Americans entering a rural community as if they could solve\
  \ their problems. So I tried to put aside any preconceived notions I held about\
  \ India's impoverished communities. But even though I didn't expect to uplift a\
  \ village from poverty, I imagined leaving the community better-resourced than I\
  \ encountered it. \nSo you can imagine my embarrassment when, upon our arrival at\
  \ the first village, I \ncaused a power outage after plugging my laptop into the\
  \ wall. As I held the useless power cord in my hand, I looked up to see 50 pairs\
  \ of eyes staring at me. They were unfazed by the outage - apparently it was common\
  \ - but they were waiting for me to entertain. I laughed uncomfortably and realized\
  \ we had no plan B - without our laptops, we were nothing.\nWe had been asked to\
  \ teach women about sanitation and self-care, so naturally we prepared PowerPoints\
  \ replete with animations and videos. When we tried to explain our having technical\
  \ difficulties the audience - 50 women, sitting cross-legged on the mud floor -\
  \ simply stared back. They didn't understand why we couldn't proceed without power.\
  \ \nSome would call this village backwards - computers did not exist, electricity\
  \ was a luxury and most had never traveled outside the village. Yet I couldn't help\
  \ but feel that we were the real fools. As I walked around the village and saw women\
  \ earning a living by selling hand-made soap, men stripping bamboo to weave into\
  \ baskets, and children writing song lyrics as a pastime activity, the word resourceful\
  \ took on a new meaning. Women formed microfinance groups to create a bank from\
  \ which they could borrow money in times of need and support one another. \nWhen\
  \ I have a problem, I google it; when they have a problem, they solve it themselves\
  \ or collectively. \nOblivious to advancements in technology and the social media\
  \ revolution, the village was innovative, family-oriented, and happy. We enter their\
  \ homes and they treat us with hospitality, offering tea and biscuits. They entertain\
  \ themselves by singing and dancing, not by watching Netflix or playing video games.\
  \ When the power goes out, the village doesn't break down. \nAfter this trip, I\
  \ wondered how \"advanced\" our technologically savvy society truly is. The way\
  \ of life of in Sidbhari is different, not backwards, nor in need of revolutionary\
  \ technology. They may have fewer resources, but they were also some of the most\
  \ creative, intelligent, and kind people I have ever met.\nSo as I left Sidhbari\
  \ and entered the bustling city of Delhi, I couldn't help but laugh when my friend\
  \ said, \"Thank god we are in a normal city again.\""
