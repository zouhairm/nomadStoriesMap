Text: "Since I was born I started to travel, before I complete 1 year my mom moved\
  \ for a small city, maybe she thought it was better for me and my brothers and sisters\
  \ grow up there. My mom raise us all by herself, me 3 sisters and 3 brothers, it\
  \ was really difficult. When I was 8 years old I was adopted, It was for me to just\
  \ spend Christmas and New Year's Eve parties. It was a very change in my life, I\
  \ lived with other family, I study in a better school and I had more siblings. I\
  \ travelled with this family for Santiago, my first travel in a car, I lived 1 year\
  \ with them, but when they decided to change cities I back to my family. Than When\
  \ I was 14 I subscribed in a high school in other city, I did all the process and\
  \ passed. I think it was really good for me, I studied and live in a school with\
  \ peoples all around Brazil, I learned too many things. I lived 3 years there, it\
  \ was really strange from the start because I never had travelled for a big city,\
  \ I saw how small was my perception of the world. In these 3 years I explored Rio\
  \ de janeiro, I had field trip with the school, for Ouro Preto and Pantanal. I was\
  \ just very exited for to see and to learn more and more about my country, but before\
  \ I even noticed I was back home. When I back home I started search for maps and\
  \ I discovered my city was near of 3 countries, than I dicided visit Buenos Aires,\
  \ Paraguay and Uruguay. When I was in Buenos Aires I liked the city so much that\
  \ I was wondering if I should do my University there I really visited some universities,\
  \ when I arrived in Paraguay I was devastated 3 days before an earthquake occurred\
  \ and it was 3:00 am and everything was opened, too many childrens trying selling\
  \ things in the streets, many houses destroyed, I was sad because I knew it was\
  \ reflections of previous wars. In the other day I arrived in Uruguay, they are\
  \ having a local party with dances and typical foods, it was a really good experience,\
  \ but it was time to back home. Six months after I decided to move for other state\
  \ Florian\xF3polis-SC, this city have many beaches so the summer have many tourists\
  \ and is not so expensive after summer, I find many peoples from my state, so I\
  \ thought for myself I just discovered my new home, but my money was running out.\
  \ I got a job in other city so I had to move on again, it was the city who have\
  \ grape festival, but unfortunately they are not having this year, than I discovered\
  \ the man who I was working was bankrupt So I decided to move for S\xE3o Paulo with\
  \ a help of some friend I met in Florian\xF3polis-SC. I lived 2 years there in the\
  \ last one I did some exams for attending universities, When I discovered I passed\
  \ in a university in Florian\xF3polis-SC I just move on again, but when I arrived\
  \ I discovered that haven't students enough for make a class, but I stayed here,\
  \ waiting for my next journey. The friend who helped me to go to S\xE3o Paulo is\
  \ going to Portugal in March he told me about there and made me realized that I\
  \ need go to there and met those peoples, learned with them. I just know that the\
  \ world is my home so I just need to know my home better."
