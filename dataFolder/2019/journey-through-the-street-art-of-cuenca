Text: "After climbing 439 steps I arrived at the Mirador Turi in the city of Cuenca,\
  \ Ecuador. The panoramic view is something like this: a city crossed by four rivers,\
  \ houses with red roofs and a lot of vegetation. I observe well-preserved facades,\
  \ cobblestones, baroque balconies and churches that stand out for their Gothic and\
  \ Renaissance-style cupolas. From the top, the only thing that breaks the harmony\
  \ of this colonial city is the wind that forces me to blink more often. In the distance,\
  \ some rays of sunshine slip between the encased clouds and the mountains of the\
  \ national park \"El Cajas\".\nSince its founding, the \u201Ccuencanos\u201D had\
  \ a fervent faith towards the Catholic religion so for a long time, Cuenca was famous\
  \ for being an extreme ecclesiastical city. The map I have in my hand shows that\
  \ there are more than twenty churches in a very small space. But there is another\
  \ facet of it that is not reflected in the travel guides and is the one I came to\
  \ look for. This is the city that speaks through its walls.\nJust walk away some\
  \ blocks from the historic center to begin to peek the murals. Every hundred meters,\
  \ the walls become a canvas and the City an open museum where all kinds of themes\
  \ and techniques coexist. \nAfter walking for a while under the January sun, I begin\
  \ to smell paint and then discover that I am lucky. With a few curious looks around\
  \ me, I am a witness. I note that aerosol boxes make a support bench to reach the\
  \ top of the wall. Paul Desmond is one of the artists who is participating in the\
  \ collective intervention to decorate the walls of Brother Miguel La Salle School,\
  \ in Avenida Solano. \n\u2500I started when I was 17 doing tags and researching\
  \ on my own. I liked it so much that from there it changed my life. If I hadn't\
  \ started making graffiti I don't think I would have studied at the university.\n\
  Today he is a designer and when he speaks he shows his passion and desire to share\
  \ his art.\nThe murals took from a few hours to whole days of work. The artists\
  \ are meticulous in the details. They paint day and night. Many, like Paul, began\
  \ to graffit during adolescence as an act of rebellion, but then \u2500 or perhaps\
  \ for this \u2014 they became interested in art and even became professionals. This\
  \ is not accidental; The University of Cuenca is one of the best study houses in\
  \ the country and many of its careers are related to art.\n\u2500Painting on the\
  \ street you feel that your art is not only for you but for enjoyment by the whole\
  \ world. You can see all the people, without class differentiation, says Paul. \
  \ \nThe street gives them visibility.For some, Street Art became a job. They are\
  \ much better at painting outdoors than keeping their jobs in museums and galleries.\n\
  As I keep walking along the cobbled streets and dodging churches I find more murals.\
  \ I perceive how the graffiti are occupying the empty space of the cement walls\
  \ that, gradually, fill with color. Artists not only create true works of art \u2014\
  ephemeral \u2014 but use these spaces as exhibition platforms and as a way of expressing\
  \ themselves. The interesting thing is not only what you see, the mixture of colors,\
  \ shapes and figures, but each work tells a story. The street becomes a museum of\
  \ living art with political, social or aesthetic messages. And it is often these\
  \ expressions that reflect the local culture and those that best measure the thermometer\
  \ of the social moment that is being lived in a place. Those moments that do not\
  \ appear in the traditional museums or in the travel guides and that, to recognise\
  \ them, do not need to spend a single penny. Just walk down the street with your\
  \ eyes wide open and discover what your walls say."
