Text: "IN MALINDI\n\nOn the brink of the Indian Ocean, a hundred kilometers away from\
  \ Mombasa, there is a city called Malindi. It is not easy to get there: an invisible\
  \ line cuts it out from all the rest. Behind that line is where lost things end\
  \ up; where dreams, people and streets end. There, in Malindi, is where the world\
  \ ends; but the world doesn't know.\n\tWe are all pioneers, behind that line.\n\t\
  All pioneers, in Malindi.\n\tIn Malindi there is a child swinging on a rope dangling\
  \ between two palm tree logs. He is lost, and he doesn't know. He swings on a rope\
  \ that is no more that a wire, back and forth, back and forth; his face round like\
  \ the moon, his belly empty. He swings on a rope that is not a swing, and days pass\
  \ by right under his nose, dry, empty days.\n\tIn Malindi there is an Amazon going\
  \ around bare-breasted. She lives on the street, and she doesn\u2019t care. In the\
  \ daytime she begs for a crust; at night she sells lo-ve to the passerbies. Fake\
  \ love, good price.\n\tIn Malindi, right in front of the Kilimangiaro Shop, there\
  \ is an old man, papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 like face, roasting fresh-caught fish until\
  \ it burns, then wrapping it in newspaper and calling the tourists in a loud voice\
  \ - that is the tastiest fish in Africa, it tastes like sea, and salt.\n\tIn Malindi,\
  \ behind the rotten gate of the orphanage of Timboni, there are ten little boys\
  \ dancing and yelling, colorful hats on their heads, their knees encrusted with\
  \ old scars. They are begging for the money to buy a soccer ball, because a soccer\
  \ ball can make everyone happy, in the landfill of the world. Sometimes, one of\
  \ them gets to sneak out of the orphanage to get food for himself and the others.\
  \ Sometimes, the tourists roll down the windows of their jeeps and feed candies\
  \ to the little boys, ignoring that candies do more bad than good, in Malindi, where\
  \ people don\u2019t own a toothbrush.\n\tIn Malindi, where the red of the soil meets\
  \ the wild white of the beach, there is a pile of shapeless rocks, and a moman sitting\
  \ on them with her legs crossed. She is wearing a bandana and a crooked smile. She\
  \ breaks the rocks for a living: every day, twelve hours a day, she sits on the\
  \ pile and breaks the rocks into smaller fragments, and breaks the fragments into\
  \ smaller ones, so that the rich can cover the trails of their houses with the fruit\
  \ of her labour, with her twelve hours of incessant toc, toc, toc, toc.\n\tIn Malindi\
  \ there is a girl called Lucy. She has big eyes and a wooden toy dog on wheels.\
  \ Every day, Lucy chews up miles with the Earth sizzling beneath her feet, carrying\
  \ her little brother on her back. She is rehearsing the future, Lucy, because you\
  \ become a mother very early, in Malindi - even if your eyes are as big as hers,\
  \ even if you have so much to live, before.\n\tIn Malindi there is an adobe house,\
  \ tin roof, one door, no windows. Inside the house, only one square room; and, inside\
  \ that room, three rows of chairs; duct-taped on the wall,  the dog-eared pages\
  \ of a spelling book. That house is a school, but you can\u2019t tell at first glance.\
  \ Classes are cancelled today, because the teacher has malaria. Today, the school\
  \ is closed and empty, the students are doing hand-stands in the streets and wounding\
  \ their hands on the shards, looking in the garbage while chasing each other. Today,\
  \ in Malindi, nobody is learning.\n\tIn Malindi, when it gets dark, the air is fresh\
  \ and pasty. One by one, the candles lit on the windowsills of the adobe houses.\n\
  \tIn Malindi, when night falls, a woman wearing a bandana, a half-naked Amazon,\
  \ an old man that looks like he\u2019s made of leather, a child with a round face\
  \ and a girl named Lucy and dozens of orphans snuggle up on the roadside holding\
  \ their breaths, not to awake who is sleeping.\n\tNot to awake those who haven\u2019\
  t crossed the border, and still can sleep."
