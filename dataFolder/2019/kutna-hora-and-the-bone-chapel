Text: "Since we had plenty of time in Prague, my friend Julia and I decided to take\
  \ a guided day trip to the Czech town of Kutna Hora and to the nearby Sedlec Ossuary.\
  \ We found our tour group in the Old Town of Prague, and after a quick hour bus\
  \ ride found ourselves getting off near the Ossuary.\n\nThe first place we looked\
  \ at was the Church of the Assumption, a gothic and renaissance style church that\
  \ now hosts a tobacco factory within its walls. The history behind the church was\
  \ very interesting but also clouded in mystery. A common theme we saw throughout\
  \ our trip was that most of the people who had money and created the town in what\
  \ is now the Czech Republic  had not been nobles, and were mostly illiterate. Because\
  \ of this, much of the history of town and important dates are mostly estimates\
  \ and not facts.\n\nAfter looking outside of the church, we found our way to the\
  \ Sedlec Ossuary. It is a small Roman Catholic chapel, which is estimated to contain\
  \ the skeletons of between 40,000 and 70,000 people, whose bones have, in many cases,\
  \ been artistically arranged to form decorations and furnishings for the chapel.\
  \ The ossuary was extremely interesting as well as creepy. I was most impressed\
  \ by the coat of arms of the Schwarzenberg family that is also made of human bones\
  \ and includes a raven pecking out a man\u2019s eyes on the crest! It was very odd,\
  \ but very awe inspiring.\n\nAfter the ossuary we headed to the city of Kutna Hora\
  \ itself. Our first stop after getting off the bus was at the Church of Saint Barbara;\
  \ the patron saint of miners. The church was very beautiful and was placed within\
  \ a nice little garden area. It was nice to have a tour guide as we learned some\
  \ interesting things about the church.  One very funny thing was the frescoes inside\
  \ the church. Many of the paintings featured animals that the painters had never\
  \ seen themselves. This meant that they were just painting animals based on what\
  \ others had said (many of whom had pretended they had seen these animals). The\
  \ result was a lot of funny looking animals covering the church walls.\n\nAfter\
  \ the church we walked through the city and learned about a few more important buildings\
  \ and monuments. The town of Kutna Hora used to be one of the richest in present\
  \ day Czech Republic and was even considered more important than Prague for a couple\
  \ of hundred years. It was also a city that was known for being extremely dirty\
  \ and was a hotbed of \"sin\" back in the day. The city had a reputation of being\
  \ completely filled with alcoholics and prostitutes, and was a popular destination\
  \ for miners. Overall it was a very pretty little city and I am glad we got to visit\
  \ and learn a little about its rich history!"
