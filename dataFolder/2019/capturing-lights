Text: "I am on a bus to the middle of nowhere. It\u2019s almost the middle of the\
  \ night in Reykjavik. I am freezing, but excited. \n\nIn my mind, I replay what\
  \ our guide has told us about the Northern Lights. We are going to a remote location,\
  \ away from the city lights, so we can try to see them with our naked eye. It\u2019\
  s not a sure thing, but he will do his best. And if we don\u2019t see the Northern\
  \ Lights tonight, we can get a refund, or try again tomorrow. Except, A and I are\
  \ leaving Iceland soon. This may be our only chance.\n\nFifty minutes later, the\
  \ bus comes to a stop. As our fellow passengers start exiting, I look to A, who\
  \ is putting on her thick coat, hat, and gloves. We were warned that the usual April\
  \ Icelandic temperature would be even colder this late at night and this far out\
  \ from the city.\nAs soon as I step out of the bus, I am hit with a blast of cold\
  \ air. My Florida blood has not yet adjusted to the weather, and the extremity of\
  \ it momentarily takes my breath away. But A is already walking off, following the\
  \ crowd. I breathe in, breathe out, and follow along. \n\nWe get to the middle of\
  \ small wooden bridge and look up. Nothing. We will wait, our guide tells us. So\
  \ we do. All around us, small groups of people chatter in hushed, excited tones.\
  \ Various languages are heard among us, the motley group assembled in the middle\
  \ of Iceland nowhere. \n\n\u201CLook,\u201D the guide says.\n\nWe look up.\n\nMy\
  \ breath catches.\n\nPeaking faintly out of the black sky is a pale green line.\
  \ \n\nAs I stand there, it gets brighter. This is it. These are the Northern Lights.\
  \ \n\nI frantically reach into my coat pocket for my camera and start snapping away\
  \ like a madwoman. After about 7 shots in a row, I turn the camera around to look\
  \ at what I\u2019ve taken. \n\nNothing. Blackness.\n\nStubbornly, I take 3 more\
  \ pictures and look again. Still utter blankness. Meanwhile, the sky is now bursting\
  \ with light. The wave of green across the sky is pure and solid. It is vibrantly\
  \ neon. \n\nI have to capture this. How can I not? \n\nI pull out my cell phone,\
  \ open up the camera app, and snap a few shots. But that doesn\u2019t work either.\
  \ Yet, I try again. This is a once-in-a-lifetime sight, and I must document it.\
  \ I must. I am a writer. Documenting things is what I do.\n\nA must sense my frustration,\
  \ because she turns to me and reminds me what the guide told us on the bus. We won\u2019\
  t be able to capture the Northern Lights on our cell phones or regular cameras.\
  \ I heard him say that, too. I knew it. But how could I truly be there if I couldn\u2019\
  t prove that I was?\n\nWhen I make a vague sound of annoyance, A says, \u201CHey,\
  \ can we walk off by ourselves a bit? All the noise around us is distracting me.\u201D\
  \ I nod and follow her off the bridge and up a hill on the other side. \n\n\u201C\
  You have to take a picture with your mind,\u201D she tells me quietly, after a few\
  \ moments of silence. \u201CTake a snapshot with your mind, and then file it away\
  \ so you won\u2019t forget it.\u201D\n\nShe\u2019s right. Against all odds, I am\
  \ here. On a late April evening in the middle of nowhere, with the crisp Icelandic\
  \ air in my lungs. The Lights are shifting, waving. They are putting on a performance\
  \ for us. And I\u2019ve been so busy worrying about how to capture it, that I\u2019\
  ve lost this moment. This time I have with the neon green swatch of sky is finite,\
  \ and if I don\u2019t stop myself then what I lose will be this experience.\n\n\
  I look at A. She\u2019s opened her arms out wide, spreading them as far as they\
  \ can go. Her head is thrown back. She has a big smile on her face. She is embracing\
  \ the gift of the Lights.\n\nI smile, too. I take a deep breath. I look up."
