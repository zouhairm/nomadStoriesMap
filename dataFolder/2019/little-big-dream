Text: "In the school of a small village Makangale, lost somewhere in the middle of\
  \ a little island Pemba, Tanzania, our appearance makes an incredible effect. Some\
  \ children are terrified to the bone, some \u2014 quite curious. And then there\
  \ are those who are indecisive about what to feel. \nAs soon as we take out the\
  \ cameras and start to snap them, the kids turn away and cover their faces with\
  \ hands shyly or in some cases with a bit of aggressiveness even. Only few of them\
  \ dare to stop to pose and smile somewhat coyly. \n\nEverything around us screams\
  \ poverty: school uniforms \u2014\_re-darned a million times and still holey, torn\
  \ notebooks and textbooks, bare feet, half-empty classes, where there are not enough\
  \ chairs for everyone, so the children have to sit on the floor, and a detailed\
  \ picture of a computer drawn on the blackboard. A computer that they may never\
  \ even see in real life.\n\n\u2014 Do you have a dream? \u2014 I ask students of\
  \ an English class, that we interrupt so offhand. Most of them have just turned\
  \ 13 \u2014 a borderline age, when 70% leave the school for good. After the 7th\
  \ grade the education here is paid-for and optional. And since in most cases it\u2019\
  s far more crucial to earn money for the family instead of making them spend more\
  \ on an illusion of a better life, the choice is quite obvious. \n\u2014 My biggest\
  \ dream is to become a waiter in a chic restaurant at a luxurious hotel, \u2014\
  \ 14-year-old Becka answers me with a sincere and broad smile. \n\u2014 A waiter?\
  \ \u2014 I ask him again, confused and scared of the \"scale\" of his dream. \n\u2014\
  \ Exactly, \u2014 he defends his answer with an undeniable certainty. \u2014 I want\
  \ to meet different people from all over the world and be able to talk to them freely.\
  \ To hear all of their stories. I bet it\u2019s exciting!\n\nSuch a little but big\
  \ dream of a boy from an African island of Pemba. He is most unlikely to ever leave\
  \ the premises of this island to travel around the world (according to the implacable\
  \ statistics and the information gained from our guide, nearly no one sees something\
  \ other than their homeland in all their life and only a few islanders get to go\
  \ to the biggest town of the country \u2014 Dar-es-Salam \u2014 once or twice in\
  \ their lifetime), so he wants to be somewhere, where this huge wild world will\
  \ come to him instead."
