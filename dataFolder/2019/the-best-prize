Text: "My Trip to Tokyo, Japan, in October 2016 was hard fought for.  Given the opportunity\
  \ to compete in the world\u2019s third-largest Beauty Pageant, Miss International\
  \ as Miss Ireland 2016 did not come easy.  It was my 4th attempt at the National\
  \ Title, and with an inability to give up on a childhood dream, I felt well ready\
  \ for the competition.  What I wasn\u2019t expecting, was to fall in love with one\
  \ of the most welcoming, opportunistic and harmonious countries I had ever visited.\
  \  Another thing I really didn\u2019t expect to find was some of my current closest\
  \ friends in life.\nI\u2019m aware that sounds so clich\xE9 - \u201CPageant girl\
  \ doesn\u2019t win crown but gains so much more with friendships made\u201D when\
  \ we were all plotting against each other in order to make a place in the final.\
  \ Yet it REALLY wasn\u2019t like that.  Of course, there was a high sense of competition\
  \ in the pageant, but as one of the hardest, although amazing months of my life,\
  \ the friendships I made with the other delegates is really what kept me sane. \n\
  That, and of course the fact that although sleep deprived, I was surrounded by constant\
  \ Japanese beauty.  My room in the Tokyo Dome hotel only showed the most movie-like\
  \ view of Tokyo\u2019s crisp-clean skyscraper buildings in perfect formation.  When\
  \ stepping outside into a hotel that inhabited countless restaurants to fit the\
  \ needs of every local or tourist, from authentic sushi bars to American-style diners,\
  \ all overlooking the giant funfair, which was again, part of the hotel.  \nThe\
  \ treatment we received from locals was something I had never experienced before,\
  \ after all my years of traveling. Japanese people are beyond polite, and so helpful.\
  \  It just seemed to be their first impact to make you as comfortable as can be,\
  \ offering to take your empty coffee cup when they notice you carrying it in a store,\
  \ always allowing you to go first and holding the door for you.  I read that in\
  \ Japan they do not accept tips, but like with all our local tendencies, do not\
  \ see us as rude for trying but hand it back to you politely, with a smile.  When\
  \ telling this story to people at home, many mentioned that we were wearing \u201C\
  Miss International\u201D sashes and of course people would treat us well. However,\
  \ even on my off day, wearing jeans and trainers and looking far from Miss Ireland,\
  \ a Japanese local on the street helped me with my broken suitcase lock, smiled\
  \ and went on his way.\nI am glad my first experience of Japan was with the Pageant\
  \ however, as I never would have fit in so much touring in a month otherwise.  I\
  \ traced through the impeccably detailed Tokyo World Square, which is basically\
  \ a giant park built of mini versions of our world, broken into continents with\
  \ all the main wonders of the world such as the Taj Mahal, without forgetting the\
  \ smaller countries such as a little thatched Irish cottage \u2013 all in the most\
  \ precise detail.  \nSome tours were not what was expected.  Our trip to the Tokyo\
  \ Panasonic showroom, which was intended to be a day of girlie glamour and pampering\
  \ trying out the new facial cleanser products turned into the most educational experience\
  \ I had ever witnessed in terms of technology.  I felt like I was looking 20 years\
  \ into the future when I was shown the Panasonic plans for the future of cooking\
  \ or the home bedroom scan for checking a human body for pollen levels or chances\
  \ off sickness as they sleep.  \nFar from just a focus on glamorous activities and\
  \ looking perfect for photos, this trip really gave me a deep taste of true Japanese\
  \ culture.  From trimming a bonsai tree, dressing as a traditional Japanese Samurai\
  \ Soldier in Satima, making wishes in a fountain at the Buddhist Temple in Kamakura\
  \ or changing in a Kimono in Niigata I feel I really experienced what it was to\
  \ be truly welcomed to this beautiful country. The final night of competition was\
  \ upstaged by the journey of finding true friends and discovering beautiful Japanese\
  \ culture."
