Text: "I tried to cup my Arabic in the palms of my hands, but it dripped out every\
  \ time. \n\u201CHow come your English is so good if you grew up in the Middle East?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CYou should hear my Arabic, it\u2019s even better,\u201D I said. \nAt times,\
  \ it comes gushing out, flood gates opening in reply to a colleague asking me a\
  \ question in English. When this happens it\u2019s always with Arabic words that\
  \ can\u2019t be translated. I see someone having a meal, and the word \u201CSahtein\u201D\
  \ is a lump in my throat. Gulp, I swallow it. There\u2019s no way I could translate\
  \ that anyway. \n\nMy first time in the United States was three days after the 2016\
  \ election. My connection with this place was assigned at birth; my father named\
  \ me after Helen, Georgia. So the trip felt less like coming here for the first\
  \ time and more like coming back. But with the political polarization, I was no\
  \ longer sure that I could trust Dad\u2019s romanticized memories of his younger\
  \ years. \n\nThe first thing that struck me in Atlanta, Georgia was homelessness.\
  \ I had read about the homelessness epidemic in the US, but the reality was scary.\
  \ If this was allowed to happen in the West, what hope did we ever have, I thought.\
  \ So many people roam the downtown area with homes made of shopping carts. To them,\
  \ home is an ever-moving, ever-changing place they have to adapt to. That feeling\
  \ is familiar to anyone coming from the Middle East. Home is wherever you find a\
  \ job and feel safe enough to build a life, more often than not it is never your\
  \ native country. \n\nWalking up Stone Mountain, I heard hikers speaking German\
  \ and Russian which reminded me of something I\u2019d read. 64 languages were spoken\
  \ in Dekalb county. My family and I were speaking Arabic. We were all immigrants\
  \ or the children of immigrants standing on 300-year-old granite carved with a controversial\
  \ Confederate monument that imparts racial resentment. Everywhere you turn someone\
  \ is speaking a foreign language, yet you still feel like an outsider. \nWho belonged\
  \ here? Pop culture had prepared me my whole life for living on this side of the\
  \ world, but most Americans I met barely ever heard of Lebanon.  So, walking around\
  \ with Arabic names while speaking in Arabic can, at times, be a lonely feeling.\
  \ This was one of those times. We swapped loneliness for assimilation. After a few\
  \ annoyed looks, we decided to stick to English. \nWeathering pits and rocks etched\
  \ with religious verses, \u201CFor God So Love\u201D were dispersed throughout the\
  \ trail, under the shade of the loblolly pine and red cedar trees that looked like\
  \ they were reaching up to God. It\u2019s a 1 mi walking trail to the top where\
  \ I was 1,686 feet above sea level looking at the Appalachian Mountains. Tired hikers\
  \ can take a cable car down from, what seemed at the time, the top of the world.\
  \ Who knew the top of the world had restrooms, souvenirs and a snack bar available?\
  \ \nHiking down the mountain, we felt euphoric thanks to endorphins. It was a fitting\
  \ end to our trip, but our journey traversing the path of dual identities was only\
  \ just beginning. The following summer my family decided to move to Virginia, a\
  \ place that didn\u2019t necessarily welcome us, at a time when our countries of\
  \ birth rejected us. As far as the melting pot metaphor goes, we\u2019re still speaking\
  \ Arabic. A year later I ask myself the same question; who belongs here? All of\
  \ us."
