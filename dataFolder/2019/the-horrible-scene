Text: "Two years ago, my brother and I took a break from life to go cavorting across\
  \ central China. Three weeks of ascending hundreds of mountainous steps until our\
  \ calves burned, drenching mysterious meat into hot pot broth that made our eyes\
  \ sting, and traveling by overnight trains where smoke and urine particles replace\
  \ pure oxygen. \n\nTo say my brother and I crave adventure over comfort and luxury\
  \ would be an understatement. Perhaps that\u2019s why our most cherished memory\
  \ from the trip was something referred to as a \u201Chorrible scene.\u201D\n\nDuring\
  \ our stay in Chongqing, we took a train ride to experience the Fengdu Ghost City,\
  \ a collection of shrines and temples on a mountain dedicated to the Chinese afterlife.\
  \ Statues of ghosts with fangs and angry, gnarled faces guide the pathway to \u201C\
  hell.\u201D One stone demon is shown spanking a boy\u2019s bare bottom. Another\
  \ is grasping chains, his mouth open and frowning as if frozen in mid-scold. This\
  \ macabre place is noted by BuzzFeed as one of the \u2018Absolute Creepiest Places\
  \ to Visit on Earth,\u2019 a title worthy of a visit.\n\nUpon our arrival to the\
  \ mountain, we recognized the entrance: a stark, gray concrete wall housing an open-mouthed\
  \ demon through which visitors enter. The sight seemed familiar from our research,\
  \ with the addition of a gaping hole of dug up earth before it, and bright orange\
  \ caution tape surrounding the mess. Both the menacing demon and the caution tape\
  \ were signs this was probably not an entrance, unless it was part of the creepy\
  \ shtick. \n\nMy brother and I wandered the area, warding off Chinese men trying\
  \ to sell us trinkets, until we came across what appeared to be a visitor\u2019\
  s center.\nBarren and unwelcoming as the entrance to the Ghost City, the only signs\
  \ of life in the lobby were two young Chinese women sitting at an information booth.\
  \ Figuring they were our best option to becoming one step closer to the Buddhist\
  \ version of a \u201CSpooky Mormon Hell Dream,\u201D we approached them. \n\u201C\
  Ni hao! We\u2019re looking for the Fengdu Ghost City.\u201D My brother\u2019s seemingly\
  \ simple question received blank stares from both women. He tried again. \u201C\
  Fengdu Ghost City?\u201D \n\nOne of the women responded with a smile of recognition\
  \ and a quick nod. \u201CFengdu.\u201D Yes, we knew we traveled to the county of\
  \ Fengdu, but we didn\u2019t anticipate challenges in order to visit what we thought\
  \ was a popular tourist destination. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until my brother started\
  \ imitating spooky ghosts to help them understand what we were looking for (unsuccessful),\
  \ that the other woman brought out her cellphone. She pulled up an app that translates\
  \ English recordings into Mandarin text and vice versa, and started to record what\
  \ my brother was saying.\n\nFinally understanding what we were looking for, the\
  \ women pulled back in shock. One spoke rapid Mandarin into the app, then presented\
  \ us with the English text translation on her screen. \n\n\u201CYou wish to see\
  \ the horrible scene?\u201D the phone read. They stared at us in disbelief, as if\
  \ we just escaped from a nearby mental institution, seeking some sort of dangerous\
  \ thrill like storm chasing. \n\nMy brother and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh at\
  \ the situation: Here we were in the middle of nowhere, having traveled to see grotesque\
  \ demons, only to be judged by employees at the information center for the very\
  \ attraction we came to see. Much to our chagrin, the women began laughing too,\
  \ though we couldn\u2019t tell if it was with us or at us. One of them spoke into\
  \ the app, the translation presented to us.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s under construction\
  \ and won\u2019t open for two years,\u201D the phone read. That explained the caution\
  \ tape and lack of people. Perhaps out of exhaustion or hilarity, my brother and\
  \ I started laughing again, which prompted the ladies to rejoin in a fit of giggles.\
  \ \n\nWe could have been resentful about many factors from the day: the money spent\
  \ on travel to this desolate place, the waste of time during our precious vacation,\
  \ and misinformation about the Ghost City\u2019s temporary closure. But we will\
  \ forever associate one of the \u2018creepiest places on earth\u2019 with amusement,\
  \ absurdity, and connecting with strangers despite our language barriers."
