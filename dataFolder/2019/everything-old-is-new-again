Text: "The horse drawn cart finally made me stop. The GPS navigation system I'd rented\
  \ with the car was useless. Once out of range of the tiny airport in Transylvania's\
  \ Targu Mures, it just kept telling me to turn left, even when there were no roads\
  \ to be seen except the curving deserted one on which I was driving. Unsure what\
  \ else to do, I'd kept going, praying the signal would miraculously return, directing\
  \ me towards Sibiu, maybe reassuring me that I was indeed on the right path. But\
  \ any navigation help I needed wasn't going to come from my dependence on technology\
  \ or the grossly vague and not to scale map I'd grabbed in the shabby rental office.\
  \ So when the next bend of the road revealed a slow moving cart caravan blocking\
  \ the narrow lane ahead of me, I pulled off onto the shoulder of the road, a sinking\
  \ feeling in my gut. \n\nMy past called me to Romania. For my first solo trip in\
  \ over 20 years, I'd hesitated to pick a destination. My thirst for something new\
  \ and challenging was fierce, but my fear of being lonely and alone tempered it.\
  \ Nowhere too romantic, nowhere too expensive, nowhere I'd been before or that had\
  \ been on the list my soon-to-be ex-husband and I had excitedly curated of all the\
  \ places we wanted to experience together. This trip had to be about me, and the\
  \ parts of me that I felt were missing. Where had that wild adventurous girl gone,\
  \ the one who only wanted to explore, who had easily met friends on the trains and\
  \ in hostels and random restaurants where she'd wandered? The one who never felt\
  \ lost because she knew that forward was the only direction that mattered?\n\nSomewhat\
  \ ironically, I had to look deep to the past to find her. Embarking on a self-made\
  \ heritage tour, I'd flown to Romania from Budapest. My adopted father, the only\
  \ one I remembered, had escaped from Hungary and somehow made his way to Florida\
  \ where he met my mom, and me, just a baby. When he was dying of leukemia years\
  \ later, my mother petitioned both governments for his mother, still living in Budapest,\
  \ to be able to come say goodbye to her dying son. She did make it, briefly, bittersweetly,\
  \ but long enough for me to remember how much I hated the taste of sandwiches made\
  \ with lard, and how I cherished getting to meet her at all. Since the fall of communism,\
  \ Budapest had been on the back burner of my travel list, tinged with grief and\
  \ loss, but also hope and wonder that so much could change. It felt right to make\
  \ the flight reservations, the new me closing the loop on a tattered childhood end.\n\
  \nRomania came from my mother's side. And it seemed exciting, a place that was slightly\
  \ off the beaten route through Europe, mysterious and adventurous. History. Folklore.\
  \ Medieval UNESCO World Heritage sites. Good value. Everything I wanted. When I\
  \ started investigating routes of what sites to see, driving was my best option.\
  \ Other than reading some blogs, I tried not to think too much of what it would\
  \ be like to drive in a foreign country. When I was married, my husband always took\
  \ the wheel. I'd confidently assured the rental agent, and myself, that I absolutely\
  \ knew how to drive a manual transmission. As long as I have GPS, I should be good,\
  \ right?\n\nThis is not good, I thought as I stepped out of the car. It was a bit\
  \ of a shock, watching the horse lumber down the road, realizing I was standing\
  \ on an overlook above a valley of wine grapes, the straight lines twisted by the\
  \ undulating hills, not a gas station or modern building or cellular signal in reach.\
  \ Just me, and some horse carts. Another one drew up, the sounds of horse hooves\
  \ slowing, wheels creaking, a wizened man dressed in a red shirt and rough pants\
  \ looking curiously at me and my reddened eyes. 'Sibiu?' I called out, my voice\
  \ cracking. He smiled widely, giving me a thumbs up. 'La dreapta' he said. \n\n\
  I started the car, smiling. Right."
