Text: "As a 12 year old girl living abroad, who would\u2019ve guessed that I come\
  \ from a country with 17,000 islands, 700 languages, and 300 cultures?!\nI grew\
  \ up in Australia, specifically in Melbourne. On the year 2010, I moved to Indonesia\
  \ and lived on an Island called Java. Indonesia owns 33 provinces, every province\
  \ have different cultures and languages. Even the same province itself, varies many\
  \ other different languages and cultures. Indonesia has 6 religion as options to\
  \ follow. These religions are Muslim, Christian, Catholic, Kong Hu Chu, Buddha,\
  \ and Hindu. It is an obligation for the citizens to have a religion in this country,\
  \ otherwise it will prohibited to become an Indonesian citizen without one. This\
  \ variety of cultures created many different customs.\nAs  I was dreaming of becoming\
  \ a surfer and living the exotic life, my life gave me a surprise. A surprise that\
  \ formed my personality to accept differences in a colorful way. I began to observe\
  \ that Indonesian people are very polite. Especially in the tradition of Javanese.\
  \ Doing \u201Csalim\u201D which is a handshake by putting the eldest\u2019s hands\
  \ on our cheeks and hunching backs while walking in front of older people. Indonesian\
  \ people also never say no, due to their kindness and high self aware of helping\
  \ others. Indonesian people are very fond of tourists and western people who are\
  \ traveling to visit. They call western people \u201Cbule\u201D. Many Indonesian\
  \ people gets excited and take photos as if they are meeting celebrities. As bules\
  \ walk pass by, many street sellers or traditional trasportations drivers and citizens\
  \ would be shouting \u201Cbule, bule! Hello bule!\u201D. Indonesia is a very hot\
  \ and exotic country. So, when people visit Bali you will see many beers, bikinis,\
  \ and parties. Bali is considered the western part of Indonesia. But, when you visit\
  \ the real part of Indonesia, such as cities in Java Island, or Sumatera Island\
  \ etc, you will notice that people tend to dress very closed. Wearing shorts or\
  \ bikinis will be viewed as a negative clothing wear to be worn around these parts\
  \ of areas. This part of culture occurred, due to the combination of religion, law,\
  \ and habits.\nIndonesia owns a unique yet beautiful fabric called Batik. Batik\
  \ is drawn using canting and wax. This fabric owns variety of different patterns.\
  \ Every pattern has philosophies and stories behind, which they explain in the drawing\
  \ of the patterns. The javanese culture also owns a puppet which they call Wayang.\
  \ These puppets tells a mystical and historical stories that are performed on a\
  \ silhouette stage lighting, or sometimes they have people dressing up as these\
  \ puppets. I watched this live Wayang Performance in a city called Jogjakarta which\
  \ is located near Central Java. Javenese traditional culture is known very graceful\
  \ and soft. \nAs I traveled to Bali which is one of the eastern island of Indonesia,\
  \ was completely different as I compared to Java Island. Bali Island has an aggressive\
  \ culture. As I was watching and listening to the slow and graceful tempo of music\
  \ and dance from the Javanese Culture, the Balinese Culture has a faster tempo of\
  \ their traditional music and expression in dancing. One of the traditional dance\
  \ called Kecak is where a group of people creates a circle and somehow doing a spiritual\
  \ dance of calling the spirits. That was how I visioned it as I was observing. After\
  \ Bali, I traveled to an island next to it, called Lombok Island. Lombok has an\
  \ interesting culture as well. Weaving is the skill that you are obligated to learn,\
  \ especially for women. As they get married, they are obligated to make a certain\
  \ pattern while weaving to give to their husband on their wedding day as a vow.\
  \ They also have to make one for their mother-in-law as a vow as well. Their traditional\
  \ clothing wear is called Sasak. Lombok is a very beautiful island with beautiful\
  \ beaches. An hour away from Kuta Beach, you can find Indonesia\u2019s Pink Beach!\
  \ The sand was pink and had a beautiful view of the blue ocean. \nWhat I learned\
  \ in my experince of living in different cultures and countries, is the skill of\
  \ understanding differences and accepting different perspectives everday."
