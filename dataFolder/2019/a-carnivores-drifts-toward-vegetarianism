Text: "1) Outside of Kansas City (Missouri, not Kansas), the summer after 10th grade,\
  \ I saw a truck of chickens on the highway; a tarp mostly covered the wire cages,\
  \ but you could see the bottom 4 or 5 rows. Some chickens were dead, but all were\
  \ too tall for their cages. It seemed like each cage had a few eggs rolling around\
  \ and multiple chickens (the live ones would peck at each other every once in a\
  \ while). Chickens, ironically, packed in like sardines. \n\n2) Sometime in my high\
  \ school career (I think it was while I was learning to drive so sometime probably\
  \ during the summer before 11th grade again) my mom and I drove up to Rehoboth Beach,\
  \ DE together. We were on the highway right outside Rehoboth when a moth landed\
  \ on our windshield, right in front of me as I sat placidly in the passenger seat.\
  \ It was gross, ugly, and clearly injured (it obviously had issues). So we\u2019\
  re at a stoplight, and we notice it kinda suddenly and are unsuccessful at getting\
  \ it to go away. I don\u2019t know why, but I get all stressed out because it\u2019\
  s clearly in trouble. Then my mom says, \u201CI\u2019ll just put on the windshield\
  \ wipers!\u201D Now, I freak out. I start crying, begging her not to, because the\
  \ bug/giant moth isn\u2019t going to be able to get out of the way, and its guts\
  \ are going to be spread across our minivan\u2019s large windshield. So we decide\
  \ to just drive and hope the air stream pushes it off. When the light turns green\
  \ my mother starts slowly but then floors it. And I watch the poor, helpless, flimsy\
  \ thing roll off the top of the windshield, probably to be launched and land splat\
  \ on the ground, struggling for life, only to be run over by an 18-wheeler, or hit\
  \ another car and die.\n\nOr, even worse, a convertible.\n\n3) On the way back from\
  \ Everglades, December 2000, at a gas station in southern Virginia, I saw a truck\
  \ of pigs. I think it was an Exxon Station. I don\u2019t remember if they were dead\
  \ or alive, but I thought of the chickens. \n\n4) TODAY: About an hour ago by now,\
  \ as I keep getting interrupted/interrupting myself, I killed a fly. I vacillate\
  \ (depending on my mood at the time) between preferring to kill bugs and taking\
  \ them outside to save them. Often it\u2019s a matter of how messy I think they\u2019\
  ll be (i.e. crickets go outside). But unless I\u2019m feeling either frustrated\
  \ or aggressive, I\u2019d say I usually like to take it outside as long as my patience\
  \ can take it. Flies are harmless, but hard to catch. So after some struggling with\
  \ a lampshade, I give up. But a few minutes later, having been handed a fly swatter,\
  \ I catch the sucker in the corner of my eye on the vertical blinds.\n\nBAM!\n\n\
  I smack the outermost blind. The slow-mo instant replay shows my strike transfer\
  \ from Venetian blind to Venetian blind. Sandwiched as one blind strikes the next\
  \ for an instant, the fly then drops 3 or 4 feet to the ground. I see him writhing\
  \ in pain; whimpering; fluttering his legs around as he lies on his back on the\
  \ carpet, trying to survive. I shudder in disgust at what I have just done. I can\u2019\
  t get to the bug to finish him off and end his painful death because a chair leg\
  \ is in the way. I look at the poor soul again, and he has stopped moving. I look\
  \ to my mother, vacuuming another lampshade, for consolation, say, \u201CI\u2019\
  m never doing that again!\u201D and return to the Floridian not-very-lay-Z-boy recliner\
  \ where I have been writing. I look up and see my Caesar, staring at me, on his\
  \ back, legs in the air, next to the leg of the chair 4 feet away from me. \n\u201C\
  Et tu, Brutus?\u201D*\n\n\n*\u201DAnd you, Brutus?\u201D was said by Julius Caesar\
  \ as Brutus, a former friend, led the group coming to murder Caesar."
