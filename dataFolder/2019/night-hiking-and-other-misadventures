Text: "To my left and about one hundred feet below (30 meters for our metric friends)\
  \ rushed the Pelorus River. It\u2019s a lovely river, clear and calm pools eddying\
  \ between powerful rapids. It\u2019s a famous river, too. Peter Jackson shot \"\
  The Hobbit\" here, filming Tolkien\u2019s hairy-toed adventurers as they nearly\
  \ drowned in the water, kept afloat by wooden barrels.\n\nI feared that I would\
  \ soon be in a similar state to those hobbits, except with a thirty-pound backpack\
  \ instead of a buoyant barrel. I was hiking New Zealand\u2019s Te Araroa trail through\
  \ Mount Richmond Forest Park and dusk was falling quickly, but I was far from the\
  \ nearest campsite. I would soon be hiking in the dark.\n\nTo further complicate\
  \ matters, this was my first solo backpacking trip \u2013 and my first backpacking\
  \ trip.\n\nI\u2019m not a complete newcomer to the world of outdoor adventuring.\
  \ I grew up camping and hiking. Recently, I learned bushcraft from a young Kiwi\
  \ survivalist, sampling huhu grub and supplejack (the key is roasting the grub -\
  \ they taste like peanut butter that way). I know my way around nature.\n\nWhat\
  \ I don\u2019t know, apparently, is how to read a bus route. I arranged this trip\
  \ weeks before and even trained a little, if we\u2019re generous with \u201Ctraining.\u201D\
  \ Despite careful planning, I disembarked my bus and immediately faced the unexpected:\
  \ I was 14km from the trailhead. My campsite was another 10km from there.  \n\n\
  That was about five hours and four blisters ago. Now, night was falling. My walking\
  \ pace is slightly faster than that of an average cow (a fact I learned earlier\
  \ that day crossing fields of bovines to reach the forest), which meant that at\
  \ best, I\u2019d hike in the dark for two hours. At worst, four. \n\nSteep and narrow,\
  \ the track sidled along a riverside cliff. My weak headlamp lit only a few feet\
  \ ahead.  I was terrified. I could easily lose the trail and get lost in the forest\
  \ and die. Or slip and fall into the river and drown. Or trip and break my leg and\
  \ starve. At this point, I was convinced even a kiwi could eat me.\n\nWhichever\
  \ method of demise, I was certain I would perish. No one was expecting to hear from\
  \ me for four days, leaving plenty of time for pain and suffering before any sort\
  \ of rescue mission was launched. While I could sit the night out and wait for the\
  \ sun to rise, my stubborn and panic-stricken brain convinced me that continuing\
  \ was the only option. \n\nChanting \"one more step, one more step,\" I coached\
  \ myself through the darkness. The roaring of the river faded as I climbed deeper\
  \ into the hills. Summiting a peak, I could see the entire valley, illuminated by\
  \ the faint starlight. Trees stretched into the distance, the river weaving between\
  \ the hills. Another day, the solitude would have seemed peaceful. That night, it\
  \ was terrifying. The descent was slick with rain, making the switchbacks perilous\
  \ as I fought for stable footing. Suddenly, I fell.\n\nLuckily, the only thing that\
  \ broke was the nighttime silence as I shrieked and tumbled. Sobbing in the mud,\
  \ I wanted to give up. \n\nIn my moment of hopelessness, I glimpsed a faint glowing.\
  \ Beside me was a rock wall speckled with blue lights. Glowworms!\n\nTo picture\
  \ them, imagine the brightest turquoise stars on the clearest, blackest night. These\
  \ worms live mostly in caves, illuminating dark caverns with an otherworldly glow,\
  \ but apparently also settle on nice, damp rocks.\n\nFinding glowworms reminded\
  \ me why I started this hike. I came to New Zealand to experience nature, feel the\
  \ freedom of the trail, and challenge myself. I had been feeling lost since leaving\
  \ university months earlier and hoped that escaping to the New Zealand wilderness\
  \ would reignite my passions and confidence. As I sat mud-covered in the dark, unsure\
  \ of my survival through the night, my confidence was at an all-time low, but seeing\
  \ the magic of the glowworms helped me dash away my tears and muster the courage\
  \ to carry on. It proved I can persevere through the difficulties and maybe even\
  \ see some beauty in them. \n\nFinding the camp a few minutes later definitely helped,\
  \ too."
