Text: "A quick look at my old and not- so- smart phone informed me that it was 4 minutes\
  \ to 8am. The mercury was rising but morning freshness still filled the air. Thick\
  \ green rainforest surrounded me. I was told this trail, through steep cliffs and\
  \ gigantic trees, would eventually lead to the big blue but there were no signposts-\
  \ NO SIGNPOSTS. I was expected to just follow this unknown overgrown path. My heart\
  \ battered in my throat. \"What if I fell?\" I thought, already picturing the scene\
  \ of doom: compound fracture to the lower left tibia, a pool of blood trickling\
  \ down the rocks etc. etc. A loud rustle of leaves overhead woke me from this hair\
  \ raising scenario and drew my eye up to a little coati on a branch.  He stared\
  \ at me- judging my fear no doubt for a couple of nano seconds- before scampering\
  \ off into the green abyss. There were creatures unknown above, below and all around.\
  \ \n \nWater- tick. Sun cream- tick. Food- tick. Slight nervous rumble in the tummy-\
  \ double tick. I started walking. After an hour or so the gentle incline had morphed\
  \ into to an arduous and steep scramble over loose muddy rocks and through green\
  \ shiny leaves. I was high up now. This was a difficult hike alright. I watched\
  \ my every single step. A flat green mossy stone straight ahead caught my eye as\
  \ the perfect seat for a snack. I unpacked my bag and chomped down on a cheese and\
  \ ham roll. The self-generated noises of hiking: the walking, the panting, the crunches\
  \ of sticks, the clickety click of bag straps and the squish of mud made way for\
  \ pure silence. I sat and ate. The animals had grown silent too. The only sound\
  \ now was the slow and steady white noise of the ocean, wherever it was.\n \nThree\
  \ hours later my feet were hot and tingly. The climb had been going in a downwards\
  \ decline for the last 20 minutes or so.  I bent down to avoid a slap from a low\
  \ swinging branch and as I straightened up to go forward again, there it was\u2026\
  that glimpse of blue amid all the green. I pushed the branches out of my way and\
  \ there before me like a turquoise silk carpet laid down by the hands of some supernatural\
  \ being was The Pacific Ocean.  Two headlands jutted out like outstretched arms,\
  \ hugging the white sandy beach into their broad forest chest. Almond trees lined\
  \ the beach, a few gulls screeched overhead and pieces of driftwood littered the\
  \ shoreline. I steadied myself and jumped down from the sandy bank.\n \n I plonked\
  \ onto my weary and aching arse and carefully began untying my dirty, wet laces.\
  \ Removing my old manky boots I rubbed my throbbing feet. I neatly folded my socks\
  \ into each boot. I scrunched my toes up and inhaled as the soft warm sand poured\
  \ between each hot and swollen toe. I had a quick look around to make sure I was\
  \ indeed alone before peeling my black leggings off and hanging them from the branch\
  \ behind me. Piece by piece I removed the rest of my clothes. I released my hair\
  \ from its tight ponytail and headed for the water. \n\nThe wash hit my feet with\
  \ a gentle baby crash and it was the most perfect temperature. I walked to waist\
  \ height and turned around to look at the jungle behind me. This was an immense\
  \ view, wild, natural, beautiful- not polished and perfect like a tropical island\
  \ postcard, this beauty was rawer and more awesome. I was in a veritable bath of\
  \ green trees and blue seas - nature\u2019s best. With a big breath in and eyes\
  \ closing I dropped straight as a plumb line under the water. I swam and floated\
  \ in that ocean for what felt like hours, around and around in circles, over and\
  \ back in straight lines, on my stomach, on my back, on my side. Not one single\
  \ other soul stepped foot on that very remote beach for the day. Costa Rica\u2019\
  s oldest rainforest and my first step into the unknown."
