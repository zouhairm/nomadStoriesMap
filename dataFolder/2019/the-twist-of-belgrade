Text: "My nostrils knew before I did. The train was frequently stopping and starting\
  \ in the soft early morning, arrival was imminent. A heavy bustling made its way\
  \ down the corridor and stopped. A scratchy woollen uniform slid the door ajar and\
  \ full-bodied cigarette smoke snarled into the small room. A gruff \u201Cpassports\
  \ please\u201D from a square-framed uniform announced the dawn of my manifesto:\
  \ Beograd. As I fumbled through my documents I caught a glimpse out the grimy window,\
  \ seeing nothing but grey and frayed edges. What exactly was I doing on this eastward-bound\
  \ night train, now far from those more-famed cities that had once seemed quirky\
  \ but now felt childishly familiar?\n\nThe morning sun was barely strong enough\
  \ to pierce the scraggly, weed-like grasses that dressed the rusted tracks. We chugged\
  \ into a platform that seemed to never end, and when it did end, somehow my journey\
  \ was to continue around the outskirts of the central zone on a smaller set of tracks\
  \ that rattle-banged with disturbing vigour. The ghosts that inhabited the tramcar\
  \ didn\u2019t seem to note my presence. Presumably all the decay outside had severely\
  \ blunted their senses. I fell out onto the street at a bend which, according to\
  \ the folded map acquired back at the station, seemed close enough to the appointed\
  \ destination, though my heavy pack was sure to tell me if I were wrong. Stumbling\
  \ up a winding street and even windier staircase, I met a man who claimed to be\
  \ dragon. The dragon had quite a wit about him\u2014well-rehearsed quips designed\
  \ for occasions such as these\u2014which was a small puff of hope in spite of the\
  \ grim. I was shown to a room with bedding and d\xE9cor from another time (think\
  \ patchwork and trim) but the surrounds quickly faded as a heavy stupor descended\
  \ upon me. Three days of tickets, timetables and upright chairs will do that. \n\
  \nI awoke from the coma. Dragon smoke wafted under the door, dull laughter pulsated\
  \ through the wallpaper. How many hours had passed? Fears quickly set in. Dressing\
  \ hurriedly, I pushed out past the den, mumbling zdravo and blindly pelted down\
  \ the staircase. Standing on the hostel stoop, I stopped, taken aback. The ghosts\
  \ of the morning mist had faded and were replaced with coffee shops of cake, brutalist\
  \ buildings, modern supermarkets, fruit trees, old theatres and wide boulevards,\
  \ eclectic people and more, an entirely grand manifesto that willed itself into\
  \ existence. As I discovered had occurred many times in its history, Beograd had\
  \ reinvented itself, with a wicked new take on its old garb."
