Text: "Here I am. The summer has just started, I'm 30 and have just written my resignation\
  \ and I don't know what I'm going to do next. I was tired of a job that didn't give\
  \ me any joy or satisfaction. All I knew was that I had a whole summer before me\
  \ to see what to do with my life. A typical 30-year-old, huh? \n \nThe moment I\
  \ made decision, I felt an amazing sense of freedom. The same feeling you have when\
  \ you are on top of the mountain with snowboard, the wind is fluttering your hair,\
  \ and you close your eyes and let the board slip down. It's the kind of feeling\
  \ I had forgotten. And now I recovered it again. I jumped into the unknown without\
  \ knowing where my path will lead me. And experienced the most beautiful summer\
  \ in my life and new travel experience as well. \n\nI didn't travel abroad but decided\
  \ to discover new places here in my home country, Latvia. As they say \u2013 to\
  \ discover something new you don\u2019t need to go far away. Sometimes the most\
  \ beautiful places and all the answers you are searching for are just in front of\
  \ you or just around the corner. It turned out to be true. There were two of us\
  \ \u2013 my car and me.  And the whole seaside to explore. Latvia\u2019s Baltic\
  \ Sea coastline is around 500 km long and it surprises on every step.  Either it\u2019\
  s a rocky beach in Vidzeme, quiet beaches untouched by civilisation, wildlife in\
  \ nature park or the surfer\u2019s paradise \u2013 a tiny town called Pavilosta\
  \ in Kurzeme region - you can have it all. Much of it\u2019s charm you can feel\
  \ in those small fishing villages. And if you are lucky enough you can have an opportunity\
  \ to go fishing with old fisherman and hear amazing life stories. \n\nI started\
  \ every day without a specific plan. And when you stop making plans for every single\
  \ day, life takes you to right places and right people. For the first time in my\
  \ life I even slept in the tent close to the seaside. Cooking your meal on fire,\
  \ waking up by hearing sound of waves or going to sleep by counting stars \u2013\
  \ the best hotel in the world. Finally I had enough time to sit at the seaside for\
  \ hours, look to the horizon and think about nothing. And in those moments right\
  \ answers came. Even without a deep thinking. Instead of stressful Monday morning\
  \ with hundreds of e-mails, phone calls and meetings I was just sitting at the seaside\
  \ with cup of fresh coffee and feeling more alive than ever before. Finally I had\
  \ a time to appreciate how beautiful our seaside and countryside is.\n\nI called\
  \ this summer as an endless summer. Even on rainy days because for me it was a new\
  \ state of mind not a season. Even now when I work again in serious position I remember\
  \ that feeling. And I try to wake up every day with it. Because life itself is not\
  \ so serious as we think it is. \n\nThe unknown is always disturbing. Most of all,\
  \ we are afraid what will others think about our decisions. But it\u2019s your life\
  \ and it\u2019s your duty to live it as great as you can. You just need to make\
  \ the first move. Like with dominoes. And the rest will follow. As soon as you open\
  \ your heart to adventures, they come. And the right people come. I didn't expect\
  \ anything from last summer, but I received what was needed the most. I found myself\
  \ again and found my dreams I'd lost.\n\nWe put so many constraints on ourselves\
  \ everyday, imagined frames, but when will we really allow ourselves to live real?\
  \ And I think it can only be done when you get out of your comfort zone and let\
  \ yourself into life. I succeeded. Maybe it's your turn to try now? A leap into\
  \ the unknown can lead you to the most beautiful journey \u2013 your life."
