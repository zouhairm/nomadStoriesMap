Text: "I stand shaking and sweating as I am about to embark a train in the world's\
  \ most populous metropolis. Swarms of nameless commuters in non-descript gray, black,\
  \ navy and white suits push past me and behind me. Wedged into the coach I can hardly\
  \ breathe. It's kind of eerie how quiet it is in here although the early morning\
  \ train is jam packed. Finally, it's my stop and I feel relief as I disembark. The\
  \ picture that greets me outside the station is dull and dreary - light rain, half\
  \ deserted streets and drab buildings. So this is Tokyo - no neon lights, no bustling\
  \ crowds, no litter swirling around in the wind and no hubbub. Oh no! Panic sets\
  \ in because I can't find the Colonel Sanders landmark I've been given to locate\
  \ my workplace. \"Excuse me!\" I call out to passer-by\u2019s, but I get nervous\
  \ glances and apologetic looks until someone finally stops and directs me to the\
  \ red and white fast food joint.\n\nFor the next 12 months Tokyo is my home. Although\
  \ it\u2019s quite obvious to the locals that this is my adopted home; roaming the\
  \ streets of central Tokyo with a map in my hand and curly hair peeping underneath\
  \ my Russian faux fur hat. \u201CAre you lost?\u201D asks a voice behind me. I turn\
  \ around to face a tall woman. \u201CI\u2019m looking for the Imperial Palace\u201D\
  . The friendly stranger insists that she can take me there. I protest, \u201CI wouldn\u2019\
  t want you to go out of your way. I have a map.\u201D However, before I know it,\
  \ we have arrived at the Imperial Palace. \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D asks my\
  \ guide. My answer gets the standard Japanese expression of disbelief - \u201CEeehhhh!\u201D\
  \ My impromptu tour guide looks at me with twinkling eyes. \u201CI\u2019ve never\
  \ met someone from South Africa before. Can we be friends?\u201D \n\u201CSure.\u201D\
  \n\nBeing different can be a blessing or a curse. In the case of Japan it was a\
  \ blessing. It helped me to make local connections. My differences got me noticed\
  \ and opened doors for me into people\u2019s homes, hearts and lives. One of my\
  \ fondest local connections came in the form of an elderly woman who looked suspiciously\
  \ young for her age. Somehow she was mistaken for my mother. Ironically she became\
  \ a mother figure to me \u2013 plying me with home cooked meals and passing on a\
  \ kimono  to me from her mother.\n\nHaving local connections helped me to overcome\
  \ the shock of a foreign culture. If ever there was a concrete jungle, Tokyo, is\
  \ truly one. For as far as my eyes could see this sprawling metropolis is densely\
  \ packed with buildings. It is rare to see greenery, hear birds chirp (instead you\
  \ can hear your neighbors through paper thin walls) nor see butterflies or any insects\
  \ for that matter. This is in stark contrast to the \u201Cconcrete\u201D jungle\
  \ I come from where I live at the foot of Table Mountain and my suburb is bordered\
  \ by a forest. Trek deeper into the peninsula and you\u2019ll find baboons rule\
  \ the hillsides of Cape Town.\n\nOver the months I became accustomed to the easy,\
  \ efficient and safe society of the island nation I called home. As it came closer\
  \ and closer to the time for me to leave the Land of the Rising Sun, I became daunted\
  \ by the prospect of returning to my motherland. I had to prepare my senses to be\
  \ assaulted by colorful clothes, boisterous streets and people. My palate would\
  \ also have to readjust and my body reacclimatize. So often we leave our native\
  \ homes with a sense of trepidation, but we neglect to consider that our destination\
  \ will capture our hearts in such a way that we\u2019ll return home feeling like\
  \ a stranger. Returning home is always a joyous occasion but I had made such great\
  \ local connections with the kind, humble and generous people of the Far East island,\
  \ that I will always hold Japan in my heart."
