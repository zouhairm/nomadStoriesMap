Text: 'Leaving home left me empty, very conscious and frightened.

  When i had planned to move it never occured to me that i wouldnt recognise the roads
  and buildings, that id be a foreign stranger in the eyes of this new states community.

  Sure i hadn''t left the country yet as minutes, hours and day went past i felt less
  and less of the person i used to be, I was loosing my confidence, my personality,
  everything seemed fast and i constantly look confused , from getting lost en route
  to shopping centres to being cast out by local taxi drivers, Johannesburg was nothing
  like Cape Town .


  This was my new life. I had to learn and adjust to the systems and attitude here,
  even worse i was struggling with the language barrier and discrimination for bieng
  a Xhosa woman in Johannesburg.

  Yes I had fun sometimes and was privileged to see a few attractions in the city,
  but nomatter how hard I tried to live in this city the less i was alive...


  Leaving home left me empty,shattered and in tears every night thinking of the friendly
  smiles and the helping hands I''ve left behind all in the name of growth and progress.


  Leaving home made me leave myself at home.'
