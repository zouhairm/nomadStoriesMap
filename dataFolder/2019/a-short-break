Text: 'In 2012 I visited Europe for the fist time, with my family. After a long road
  trip from Lyon to Milan, everyone deiced it was time to call it a night, the city
  would be there for us to explore the next day. However,  an intense storm showed
  uninvited, and we saw ourselves stuck between dodging the balls of slush falling
  from the sky all day or sit in a hotel room and waste another day.

  So my father suggest we hop back in the car and drive up to Lugano, Switzerland.
  I was a bit taken back by his nonchalant manner, but agreed right away.

  About 2 hours on the road later we found ourselves arriving in a fairy tale. It
  was cold that day but not windy, the sun was shinning bright and all the colors
  around the city seemed extra vivid . We walked around aimlessly all afternoon, I
  don''t remember the names of the restaurant where we had lunch, the store where
  I bought the most delicious chocolate or even the park where we spent most of our
  afternoon, walking by the water near the swans.

  We left before sunset and it was already nighttime when we arrived back in Milano,
  but the storm was over, and the city was there for us to explore the next day.'
