Text: "I held on tightly to my seat-belt as our SUV roared and sped through a dirt\
  \ road a couple miles away from Mono Lake. The eight of us were struggling to keep\
  \ up with our trip director and friend, Santiago. He is notoriously known by the\
  \ locals for being a thrill seeker and for taking his guests out to long missions\
  \ and hikes through the woods. It was day two of our five day educational trip;\
  \ our mission as students, was to learn as much as we could about the Mono Basin\
  \ and water conservation. Since he was close friends with our department chair,\
  \ Santiago mentioned he had a special treat for us. Once in a while, we would all\
  \ exchange nervous glances; we couldn\u2019t shake away the idea that we were being\
  \ kidnapped.\n\n\u201CKeep up, haha,\u201D his voice echoed through our walkie talkie.\
  \ He drove a tiny car ahead of us that allowed him to navigate the roads with ease.\
  \ At a distance, I imagined that we resembled a cat chasing a tiny mouse.\n\nWe\
  \ had been on the road for about thirty minutes, and we were still struggling to\
  \ keep up with Santiago. \u201CIn a couple meters, I\u2019m going to make a sharp\
  \ right, stay close.\u201D\n\nThe sun had completely set, and the moon had not yet\
  \ risen. Our headlights were our only source of light - we were in complete darkness.\
  \ Occasionally, we had seen headlights from other cars in the distance but it had\
  \ been a while since we had seen any lights. I began to doze off but then was startled\
  \ awake when I glimpsed trees through my half shut eyes.\n\n\u201CTo your left there\u2019\
  s an old mining town, the Mono Mills,\u201D I closed my eyes and looked away - my\
  \ imagination ran wild and frightened me as I imagined the ghosts of miners waving\
  \ as we drove by.\n\n\u201CI want everyone who is not driving to put their hands\
  \ up in the air and say, \u2018weeeee!\u2019 Ready? Ok.\u201D We suddenly dropped\
  \ and rose as we drove over the road of some bumpy hills. We groaned and adjusted\
  \ our seat-belts. \u201CDid you enjoy that?\u201D\n\nWe parked close to each other\
  \ and jumped out of our cars nervously. We had no idea where we were, and were suddenly\
  \ taken aback by the vast desert emptiness and the constellations shone crystal\
  \ clear in the sky.\n\n\u201COkay, listen close for instructions! Tonight, we are\
  \ going to hike along the Eastern Sierra, we are going to hike up as a group\u2026\
  \ and then\u2026 well, we\u2019ll see.\u201D\n\nWe settled on top of a cliff that\
  \ was about 9,000 feet in the sky. To our right, clear skies and the lights of the\
  \ small town of Lee Vining. To our left, a lightning storm among ominous thunderclouds,\
  \ while the Scorpio constellation hung brightly above us. We all sat in complete\
  \ silence, awed as the moon rose above the clouds as lightning struck below.\n\n\
  Santiago used this perfect time to tell us that we would be hiking down on our own,\
  \ by ourselves, about five minutes apart from each other. It would take about ten\
  \ to fifteen minutes to walk back to our cars. I held my breath, this was something\
  \ I couldn\u2019t push myself to do. I had eaten alkali fly larva on this trip,\
  \ but I couldn\u2019t bear being fifteen minutes alone with my thoughts, yet I found\
  \ myself volunteering to be the first person who would go after the assistant trip\
  \ director.\n\nFour minutes in, the fast, loud beating of my heart became deafening.\
  \ I was walking on dirt and could no longer hear my steps on fallen branches. As\
  \ soon as I would catch my imagination wandering, I would snap into focus on nothing\
  \ but those distant lights from Lee Vining. I wasn\u2019t scared of running into\
  \ coyotes; I was afraid of running into something supernatural and irrational. I\
  \ thought about all the unjustifiable fears that had kept me from doing amazing\
  \ things. I was completely lost in thought, when I was surprised by the lovely smile\
  \ of the assistant trip director.\n\n\u201CThat wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201D"
