Text: "I was standing on the side of a road that twisted itself through untouched\
  \ jungles and remote countryside with my thumb out and a cardboard sign that said\
  \ \u201CSempurna\u201D. Behind me rose the tallest mountain of South East Asia \u2013\
  \ Mount Kinabalu \u2013 and a beautiful national park surrounded the foot of the\
  \ mountain with ancient flowers, massive trees and unique wildlife. My previous\
  \ days had been spent exploring the rainforest and eating the best mountain durians\
  \ from the neighboring village. I had started to love Borneo and its varied landscapes\
  \ and people. Now my plan was to visit the scuba diving paradise of Sipadan \u2013\
  \ a tiny island accessed through the mainland village of Sempurna. Fifteen minutes\
  \ or so into the waiting game a truck stopped. The window rolled down and two young\
  \ men smiled shyly at me \u2013 it was obvious that they didn\u2019t speak a word\
  \ English. Still, I managed to communicate my desire in an understandable way, and\
  \ though very hesitant to take me, they eventually caved in. The ride consisted\
  \ of breaking communication barriers, laughing a lot, eating more durians and other\
  \ local foods, and at some point they forced me to sing as the radio was broken\
  \ and they wanted to listen to music. I sang \u201CHotel California\u201D and random\
  \ Norwegian songs and they sang songs in Malaysian. After eight hours of driving\
  \ (yes I was lucky to get a long ride), the sky was dark and starry. My two new\
  \ friends communicated to me that they could not drop me where I told them to, as\
  \ it was too dangerous at night for a lonely girl. Perhaps they were right, perhaps\
  \ they were not \u2013 I was getting used to locals telling me stuff was dangerous,\
  \ but I mostly ended up doing them anyways. Nevertheless, I ended up going home\
  \ with one of the guys \u2013 Ruka \u2013 since he invited me to stay the night\
  \ at his family \u0301s house. Big, curious eyes and heaps of Asian shyness met\
  \ us as we entered the little house late at night.\nI was showed great generosity\
  \ and care the following day, and one day turned into the next. The family begged\
  \ me to stay until Monday, when they would celebrate Hari Raya \u2013 the end of\
  \ Ramadan. It was a no-brainer: It was an honor to be invited and I was very happy\
  \ to stay. Sunday was spent with the women, preparing for the big day. Mouthwatering\
  \ scents filled the house as the women cooked, and I couldn\u2019t wait to try the\
  \ special festive foods they were preparing. When Monday arrived Kartina, one of\
  \ Ruka \u0301s five sisters, took me to get dressed. She brought out a beautiful\
  \ deep blue dress. She gave me make-up and watched with fascination as I applied\
  \ it to my freckly skin and blue eyes. When I was done I was showered with more\
  \ compliments than I \u0301ve ever received: I looked like Angelina Jolie, I was\
  \ the most beautiful thing ever, I was a superstar, I was out of this world. I laughed\
  \ and thanked them for inviting me and feeding me and dressing me. We ate our way\
  \ through the day, going from house to house and feast to feast. When the night\
  \ came we sang karaoke and ate some more. Three days later I felt like a family\
  \ member, but I also felt it was time to go. After all, the underwater paradise\
  \ of Sipadan was awaiting me. Our goodbyes were filled with tears and promises of\
  \ my distant return, as well as gratitude for what had been. Kartina and her husband\
  \ ended up driving me to Sempurna even though I was planning to hitchhike. \u201C\
  You are crazy \u2013 it \u0301s too dangerous\u201D, they said, while I thought\
  \ to my self that this dangerous act of hitchhiking had brought me to them; it had\
  \ given me a unique meeting with the kindness of strangers and other cultures, and\
  \ it left me with second family in Borneo."
