Text: "Heartbroken, hungover, and halfway around the world, I plodded along the dusty\
  \ streets of El Nido in search of something that might take me home again, if only\
  \ for a few minutes. The past few weeks had held the highs and lows of backpacking:\
  \ from new friends and new wonders to sickness and fatigue. After a night of hope\
  \ and happiness, today held the opposite; all I wanted was to find something more\
  \ Philadelphia then Filipino.\n\nDepending on your view, this particular adventure\
  \ either started in Philadelphia or, more reasonably, on Penang Island in Malaysia.\
  \ It was there that I was finally feeling well enough to go and watch people stroll\
  \ up and down the bar-lined \u201Clove lane\u201D after hostel-wide disease had\
  \ taken me out of commission for the better part of a week. Inspired by the twisted\
  \ iron street art and dozens of murals, I unpacked my much-neglected notebook. As\
  \ I pushed my pen around reflecting on how Georgetown was a wonderful place to meet\
  \ travelers of all types, given its history, its affordability, and its ability\
  \ to accommodate both people who like to walk around cities (like myself) and people\
  \ who prefer proximity to nature, I met two women \u2014 one of whom transfixed\
  \ me with her eyes.\n\nThe pair had come up to me, asked what I was writing, and\
  \ engaged in all the usual polite banter. As the conversation turned to travel,\
  \ we discovered we were all going to the Philippines relatively soon, although we\
  \ would be parting ways in hours \u2014 them to Kuala Lumpur and me to Langkawi.\
  \ We promised each other we\u2019d reunite.\n\nMy island-hopping hope to see the\
  \ flirty girl with aquamarine eyes began in earnest after that. I had other promises\
  \ to keep along the way, however, so I hopped from a malicious Langkawi to the nightlife\
  \ of Kuala Lumpur. I hopped from the sleepy, self-promoting Brunei (to visit a pleasant\
  \ penpal) to the relaxed embrace of Labuan. I hopped from the beauty of Hong Kong\
  \ (a literal high as I climbed up the Peak and a metaphorical one as I stayed with\
  \ some wonderful friends I\u2019d met in Germany) to the diesely, dusty, human-machine\
  \ that is Manila. Finally, I hopped to El Nido, Palawan Island, to try to forge\
  \ a stronger connection with the girl who\u2019d been texting me for weeks now.\n\
  \nYou already know how this story ends \u2014 heartbroken and hungover. As with\
  \ the trip in general, it was highs and lows in El Nido. Beaches and bars and spending\
  \ time with a beautiful woman. Clinics and housing insecurity (how quickly we get\
  \ used to booking online instead of walking from hostel to hostel looking for a\
  \ decent price), and dealing with the loud, dusty life dodging \u201Ctrikes\u201D\
  \ (motorcycles with sidecars that enclosed driver and passengers). I thought we\
  \ were bonding as we treated her amoebiasis. On her last night there, she let me\
  \ know we were not. Feeling like an amoeba myself, I turned to the local therapist,\
  \ Red Horse (7%, $2/liter).\n\nIt was in this state \u2014 head pounding, having\
  \ traveled through four countries for a girl and literally to the other side of\
  \ the Earth from the hometown friends who might help ease my heartache \u2014 that\
  \ I made a discovery. A small piece of home that offered me a cure. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find a Philly cheesesteak in El Nido, but, tucked between a dive shop\
  \ and a liquor store mere yards from the beach, I found one. It was a reminder of\
  \ how far I\u2019d come and fuel for the journey ahead."
