Text: "Zipping up my jacket, I stepped out of the house, turning to walk towards the\
  \ water, ready to take my now daily walk down to the Stonington Point. \n\nRight\
  \ by the state lines of Connecticut and Rhode Island, on the edge of the Atlantic\
  \ Ocean, is the town of Stonington. I imagine it\u2019s like most small towns in\
  \ New England, full of homes, a few schools, churches and a main street with a few\
  \ shops and cafes. The Historical Society was kept busy year-round with the preservation\
  \ of buildings and monuments of significance to the town. \n\nComing to Stonington\
  \ was like crossing over into a different reality. I\u2019d grown up amongst high\
  \ rise buildings, concrete and steel and glass. I was used to older buildings getting\
  \ knocked down and replaced by something bigger, taller, better. In a land scarce\
  \ country like Singapore, everything was fair game in the name of progress. \n\n\
  So it was a shock to me that the house my family friends lived in was well over\
  \ a hundred years old - that much of the other houses and buildings were just as\
  \ old. I would never admit this to my aunt, but the first few nights I stayed with\
  \ her and her family, I was terrified I might fall through the floor. It\u2019s\
  \ a ridiculous thought, but I\u2019m not too ashamed to admit it. \n\nI\u2019d always\
  \ considered myself a city girl, because the city is all I\u2019ve ever known. Even\
  \ the few places I\u2019d travelled to in my life were cities, full of skyscrapers\
  \ and people; a little stifling and claustrophobic, but exciting in the energy of\
  \ the people bustling about - running errands, running to meetings, running late\
  \ for work. \n\nIn Stonington, I didn\u2019t run - I walked. I slowed down. I enjoyed\
  \ the last week of my holiday, content to simply soak in this reality where I had\
  \ nowhere to be, and nothing to do except to amble down to the Stonington Point,\
  \ look out over the Atlantic as I went, wondering if I was facing more towards Ireland\
  \ or England, thousands of miles away. \n\nTurning away from the wide expanse of\
  \ water towards Westerly, RI, you can squint and find Watch Hill, and just barely\
  \ make out Taylor Swift\u2019s summer home, right at the top. You might imagine\
  \ she\u2019s there, curled up by the fireplace, until the chilly ocean breeze hits\
  \ you and reminds you that it\u2019s winter, so she\u2019s probably in New York.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s New Years\u2019 Day, my last day in Stonington. I\u2019d gotten\
  \ up early to take my walk, intent on braving the cold t catch sunrise over the\
  \ horizon. As soon as I\u2019d reached the Point, I walked to a bench, sat down,\
  \ and pulled out my journal. \n\nI had to admit to myself that I wasn\u2019t ready\
  \ to leave. I\u2019d come to love living in this small town - it was quiet and peaceful\
  \ and I never felt like I had to be somewhere or do something, just for the sake\
  \ of it. The people here lead blissfully simple, unhurried lives, so unlike the\
  \ one I\u2019d left behind four months ago to come to the US for a semester-long\
  \ university exchange. The life I had to return to in less than 48 hours. \n\nAs\
  \ I sat there and watched the sun crawl upwards, I wondered how strange it was that\
  \ I could feel this sense of home in a place that was still largely foreign to me.\
  \ Was it odd that I found comfort in a place so unlike any I\u2019d ever known?\
  \ Maybe, but I didn\u2019t feel like questioning it too much. \n\nI heard the whistle\
  \ of the wind a split second before I felt it, biting at my cheeks and ears, pushing\
  \ me away from the water. Maybe it was a sign, telling me it was time to go back,\
  \ not just to the house, but back to Singapore, to home. \n\nAs I packed up and\
  \ got ready to leave, I looked to the flagpole at the tip of the point, where someone\
  \ was hoisting up the American flag. I waited until it was all the way up, fluttering\
  \ in the breeze, as if it was waving at me, saying goodbye."
