Text: "It was my last day at Albion House in Newcastle, England. It was a tender,\
  \ sobering moment, being stood outside in the cold, rain next to my friend and flatmate,\
  \ Sam. Along with four other flatmates, we\u2019d just finished a year-long master\u2019\
  s program and were waiting for 12 o'clock - the final hour we could be on the grounds.\
  \ The rain didn't seem to be letting up and the sky was a dark grey - typically\
  \ English.\n\nI remember telling Sam how excited I was about travelling to other\
  \ cities for the next two weeks, especially Liverpool, home of the only band that\
  \ matters: The Beatles. Still, Sam reminded me to check out the International Slavery\
  \ Museum, noting with conviction that I\u2019d like it. To be fair, I was skeptical\
  \ about his advice. I shivered remembering a summer trip, nearly four years ago,\
  \ to a cold and rainy Berlin, where one too many depressing torture museums later,\
  \ justified my hesitation. I couldn't imagine adding a slavery tour to a day filled\
  \ with a Beatles-type mantra of 'peace and love'. \n\nSam quickly promised to keep\
  \ our group chat alive, and with a wave, made his way up the street. Gripping my\
  \ own luggage, I headed toward the metro station. Free from school obligations and\
  \ ready to travel before heading back to Texas, my first stop was Liverpool - home\
  \ of the Liver bird, the Reds, The Beatles and - to my surprise - Black History.\n\
  \nSituated along the Mersey River, Liverpool's largest port boasts its domination\
  \ in 19th century global trade and its status as a World Heritage site, and in my\
  \ mind, a place where the Beatles no doubt frequented. Albert Dock was quite impressive;\
  \ I loved sitting along the waterfront with lunch - a steaming cup of tea and a\
  \ tuna sandwich from Tesco. I loved the cold, grey weather and the black port railing,\
  \ lined with colorful bunting as I quietly watched the ships go by. I loved seeing\
  \ young families and their children running up and down the ports\u2019 pathway\
  \ toward a museum or to chase the pigeons sat along the dock. I loved the selfie-takers,\
  \ the chip-eaters, and the ordinary people going about their day.\n\nI followed\
  \ the bunting, past a scruffy guitar busker, and along the famous port to take in\
  \ the scene before me. I was warm - filled with a sort of giddiness at being there\
  \ in Liverpool, soaking in all the Beatles\u2019 history. But I wasn't paying attention\
  \ because this city didn\u2019t just belong to the Beatles, but to people who looked\
  \ just like me. Before studying abroad in England, I thought the grass was greener;\
  \ race relations for Black people in Britain was progressive, but it was on Albert\
  \ Dock, where for three centuries, nearly 1.5 million African slaves were sent to\
  \ America on Liverpudlian ships. How could this legacy follow me to a place where\
  \ I thought I could exist free from the scars of racism and discrimination?\n\n\
  I checked my itinerary again and noticed I had a particular place left to go, according\
  \ to Sam. I worried that I would end my day feeling like I had in Berlin: despair.\
  \ Up a set of stairs and toward a darkened hallway, I found freedom in a bright,\
  \ orange illuminated light box. I found Liverpool's Black community - locals with\
  \ African heritage who were born, raised and lived along the Merseyside and fought\
  \ for racial equality in a climate of brutal, traumatic experiences. I found a wall\
  \ dedicated to Black American heroes, including Muhammad Ali, Maya Angelou, and\
  \ Gregory Hines. I found words, with African roots, that my family uses in a vernacular\
  \ linguists call, African-American English. I also found more nods to The Beatles,\
  \ where the street name Penny Lane, was probably named after a slave ship captain\
  \ and anti-abolitionist. Somehow, when I emerged from the dark museum halls, I\u2019\
  d found the heartbeat of Liverpool, and it didn\u2019t look like a brightly-colored,\
  \ magical mystery bus. \n\nAs the exhibition ended, I came upon an unusually small\
  \ window tucked into a corner. At a distance across from where I stood, was the\
  \ Museum of Liverpool with a banner that read - \"Imagine peace,\" and I felt infinitely\
  \ more hopeful."
