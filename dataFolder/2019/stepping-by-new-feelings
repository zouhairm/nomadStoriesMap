Text: "Imagine this girl, an western, from an latin-american small city, only child.\
  \ Crossing the world alone. Stepping for the first time in eastern lands. That was\
  \ me, in India, carring bags and lots of fears.\n\nI was afraid about the cultural\
  \ shock, afraid about the spicy food, afraid about miss too much my family and friends,\
  \ but, specially afraid about being alone, during six months, in the other side\
  \ of the world. \n\nYeah, in the beggining things were not easy, as I thought it\
  \ would be. I really was feeling like an stranger in that country. I was homesick.\
  \ Missing my family, my friends, my people. I was missing my food, where were my\
  \ rice and beans? My affraid thoughts dominated my mind in that days. Why did I\
  \ took the decision about going to India? I cried, a lot. Everything I wanted was\
  \ a ticket back home.\n\nBut somehow I knew if I purchased tickets to go back home\
  \ I wouldn't get stronger as I wanted to be. I choosed India, such a different place\
  \ to grow up. To face distinct things. So, I hold on this feelings and said to myself:\
  \ I will be an brave girl and I will live these six months in here. Keep calm. I\
  \ am still learning!\n\nTwo weeks passed by since I was there, and for the first\
  \ time, I met an Indian couple. They took me to go out, to learn a bit more about\
  \ what was India. In that day I met more indian guys. And, yeah, that was a great\
  \ day for me. A big step for what I was about to live.\n\nFrom there, I started\
  \ making friends. I was being accepted by that people. Everyday I had an appointment\
  \ with someone. Feelings of happiness began to appear. \n\nPeople are the most beautiful\
  \ and rich thing about a place. They who carries in the blood the real spirit of\
  \ what the culture is. I was being blessed. People were by my side in that time.\
  \ \n\nMaking indian friends, I knew I was not alone anymore, so I kept my insegurance\
  \ feelings inside my bags and started to live the India's culture. I set to feeling\
  \ proud being there, experiencing that country. \n\nI started to get used to all\
  \ that spices flavors and I was loving the food. Still missing rice and beans, yeah,\
  \ but enjoying to try new flavors. India has such an big menu, where everyday you\
  \ can try something new. That's what I was doing. My food repertory was growing\
  \ up and my paladar was making a party. By the way, speaking of party, India has\
  \ festivals during all year. The time I spent there I lived half of them. It's beautiful\
  \ to see how the festivals time are so important to them. They celebrate each one\
  \ with all presence in it. They are proud about this and wanted to share that moments\
  \ with me. So, during the festivals I used to wear tradicional clothes and get henna\
  \ tattoo in hands. Yeah, I was feeling part of that culture, I was living with all\
  \ heart in. Even being so different, I seemed like an indian girl in that time.\n\
  \nFor me, this latin-america girl, experiencing India was being amazing. Everyday\
  \ I was able to experiment something never faced before. In six months, I have never\
  \ ever met someone from my country. Everybody I met were indian.\n\nBut time passed\
  \ by, so fast by the way and I had to come back home. And this time, in the airport,\
  \ was me again with my bags and such a big lesson. How could I feel afraid being\
  \ alone in the second most populous place of the world. From that time, I knew.\
  \ I shouldn't feel afraid being alone anymore, anywhere."
