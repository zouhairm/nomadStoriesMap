Text: "A bomb went off in Times Square and I was going to be late for work.\n\nI didn\u2019\
  t know if there were any injuries or fatalities or why it happened. All I knew was\
  \ that all trains were being diverted away from 42nd street, and I still had to\
  \ ride the F train all the way to the West 4th station. If you asked me now, I couldn\u2019\
  t even tell you when it happened. I guess there just wasn\u2019t anything remarkable\
  \ about this particular bombing.\n\nThe subway car was packed full like it was every\
  \ morning \u2013 \u201Cconfined\u201D didn\u2019t even begin to cover it. I had\
  \ a stranger\u2019s backpack rounding third base with my backside and I\u2019d nearly\
  \ gotten lipstick all over the man\u2019s dress shirt in front of me at the last\
  \ stop. \n\nWhen the conductor came over the surprisingly clear speakers to tell\
  \ us that we were being diverted to a different track due to an \u201Cincident\u201D\
  \ in Times Square, a teenage girl, with what must have been Tony Stark level technology\
  \ to get signal through so many layers of concrete, pulled up Twitter and announced\
  \ to her friend that a bomb had gone off. \n\nI remember having a split second to\
  \ think, \u201CNot again,\u201D before it was immediately followed-up by a quick\
  \ run through of all of the trains that could take me to West 4th without going\
  \ through the Theater District. \n\nPeople groaned and rolled their eyes and huffed\
  \ through the next twenty minutes we spent stuck in a tunnel. \n\nI wouldn\u2019\
  t call myself a tough or callous person; if anything, I give faster than overcooked\
  \ spaghetti. But after moving to New York City, I\u2019d gotten a hit of that big\
  \ city Novocaine and things didn\u2019t touch me the way they did in small-town\
  \ Texas.\n\nI was a New Yorker in that moment. I was sharing an apartment with four\
  \ girls that I had met only weeks before, sharing a living room with one of them\
  \ with only a shower curtain for privacy. My closet was also the pantry. I had maybe\
  \ twenty dollars to my name, rent was due in a week, and if I was going to survive\
  \ the rest of the day, I was going to need Starbucks. \n\nAnd I was late for work\
  \ because a bomb went off in a heavily populated area.\n\nI have never lived in\
  \ a war-zone and I\u2019ve never known anyone that came from one. All of the books\
  \ say the same thing about what it can do to a person \u2013 post traumatic stress,\
  \ detachment, compassion fatigue, desensitization to violence, etc. \n\nThe City\
  \ is not a place for the mundane. It\u2019s either rapturous, or it\u2019s devastating.\
  \ Every moment feels like standing on the edge of a waterfall and waiting for the\
  \ frayed rope holding you to snap. When it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s nearly ecstasy;\
  \ the lights in Times Square turn midnight into daylight and performers in Central\
  \ Park leave you breathless. But when it finally does snap, you\u2019re not the\
  \ slightest bit surprised. \n\nThe rope snaps. A bomb goes off. People die. No one\
  \ is fazed. \n\nIt\u2019s horrible the first few times it happens. \n\nBut after\
  \ a while, you stop feeling the fall and only feel the moment you sink underwater;\
  \ and after long enough, you learn what it feels like to live there.\n\nI spent\
  \ a year underwater. \n\nA man drives his car through a crowd of people. A pipe\
  \ bomb explodes in Chelsea a few yards from me. A woman is pushed in front of a\
  \ train I\u2019m on every day. A homeless man freezes to death outside of a subway\
  \ station.\n\nAnd I sink.\n\nI didn\u2019t even notice it at first. It wasn\u2019\
  t until this bomb. It wasn\u2019t until I felt inconvenienced by an explosive that\
  \ I realized what had happened. \n\nFor all that the world has warned me of its\
  \ strife, I didn\u2019t expect to find a war-zone in New York City. \n\nThe world\
  \ is full of dangerous places and people. Trying to avoid chaos is like trying to\
  \ avoid water in a tsunami. If I\u2019m going to be swept away anyway, I am going\
  \ to see the world that makes it worth it."
