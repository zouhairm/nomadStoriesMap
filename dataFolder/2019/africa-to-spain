Text: "It was my first trip abroad and i was terribly nervous when the enormous aeroplane\
  \ stood in front of me on the morning of 15 June. I left my beloved Africa to embark\
  \ on my very first European experience. \n\nSixteen hours later, i stepped onto\
  \ foreign soil, dressed in a thick wool dress and jacket (looking complete out of\
  \ place) and was surprised by a 38 degree welcome from Spain. Armed with an underground\
  \ ticket to central Barcelona, a suitcase and heaps of experience from South Africa,\
  \ i tackled the local transport. \n\nI walked through the city for hours, indulging\
  \ in local tapas, sangria and sight seeing, not realising that my fiancee and i\
  \ were now alone at two am in the morning on our way back to the hotel. Something\
  \ unheard of in Africa because of safety concerns. \n\nSadly, we only had one day\
  \ in this magnificent city and found ourselves on a bus to a little town in Navarra\
  \ for a wedding celebration the following morning. \n\nWhat a spectacular celebration!\
  \  We were mesmerized by the architecture of the town and the church was magnificent.\
  \ The locals embraced us and we were quickly introduced to at least twelve main\
  \ courses of Spanish perfection whilst dancing the night away with the happy couple.\
  \ \n\nWe grabbed breakfast on the train the following morning and traveled in style\
  \ to Pamplona, the city of the bulls! This is where i would settle down, given the\
  \ choice. We strolled through the ancient town, watched an outdoor theater production,\
  \ swam in the rivers, had copious amounts of ice cream and patatas bravas and even\
  \ attempted a hike in the Navarra district.  We followed a group on their pilgrimage\
  \ journey and were lucky to discover a wall, offering free wine to it's thirsty\
  \ travelers. This city with it's rich culture and history stole my heart, what more\
  \ do you need?!  \n\nOur journey continued to our second last destination, San Sebastian.\
  \ Beaches, ciders and fresh cherries welcomed us to this vibrant town and it was\
  \ the ultimate relaxing destination. We were spoiled with choices for restaurants\
  \ and were delighted to experience what they call the \"old town\". My suitcase\
  \ was bursting at its seams after another shopping experience in the older district\
  \ and i eventually just bought another bag to keep my treasures safe. \n\nTwo days\
  \ later, I waved goodbye to my new favourite country and crossed the border to Biaritz,\
  \ France. The town is known for it's wealthy members who visit for holidays and\
  \ the luxurious seaside. My fiancee had a great time surfing their waves but i quietly\
  \ missed my new Spanish friends and their cuisine and longed to return to Barcelona.\
  \ I  blame myself for not brushing up on my French before visiting their country,\
  \ i could only order a glass of red wine which was an interesting breakfast choice\
  \ but quite funny either way. \n\nTwo days later, my wish was granted and we returned\
  \ to sunny Barcelona. We met up with two friends who we met at the wedding and they\
  \ introduced us to the Spanish music movement. It was a great day, filled with dancing,\
  \ more sangria and a relaxing nap in the middle of a park. We even enjoyed a last\
  \ minute picnic and soaked up the sun before returning to our cold winter in Cape\
  \ Town. \n\nI was quite sad when i left Europe and had to park my car at the very\
  \ beginning of Long street, Cape Town, in order to remind myself why i love my country\
  \ so much. \n\nI have since traveled to Madagascar and Mozambique to bring back\
  \ some African culture into my blood but have enjoyed a ski trip to Livigno Italy,\
  \ romantic walks in Venice and Verona and now, i am ready for my next destination,\
  \ Greece and Portugal! \n\nSee you soon :)"
