Text: "My impression of Savannah now: an old beauty. Stately. Sticky. Slow.\n\nMy\
  \ parents\u2019 new home was not what was expected or hoped for. Coming from hippyville,\
  \ California, with its maverick waves, left-of-Berkeley politics, and their neighbor\u2019\
  s medical marijuana plot, my parents were not considering Georgia at all as they\
  \ searched for a more affordable locale to prepare for retirement. It could even\
  \ be suggested that, before the move, we were just a wee bit dismissive of the entire\
  \ southern half of the country. After all, who would want to relocate to any of\
  \ those bible-thumping, gun-toting, redneck states after fully embracing California\u2019\
  s open-minded and accepting values.\n\nAnd yet, Savannah, Georgia was where the\
  \ job transfer was, so they packed up and moved across country. Ahead of the move,\
  \ I flew down to join my mom on their house hunt. I found a lot that could be used\
  \ as material for some late-night comedy show. The airport\u2019s hallways led you\
  \ past advertisements of automatic guns and hunting rifles right up to TSA. On the\
  \ way into town, we drove past crumbling neighborhoods, remnants of racist policies,\
  \ only to then turn onto a boulevard of gleaming white-columned mansions, adorned\
  \ by lacey Spanish moss-covered trees.\n\nSuburban America was on full display as\
  \ well and only reaffirmed my commitment to a globetrotting, metropolis lifestyle.\
  \ Hulking SUVs zipped by as we barreled down a 4-lane thoroughfare. Boxy chain stores\
  \ bejeweled either side of the road like your great aunt\u2019s chunky, out-of-date\
  \ necklace. It\u2019s ugly would smack you in the face if you got too close. All\
  \ the stores and restaurants peddled the same ordinary experience, the same ordinary\
  \ food, the same, the same, the same. I saw all that I was prepared to hate.\n\n\
  Fast-forward two years and multiple trips later and I love visiting the Old South.\
  \ I am lucky to call Savannah one of my homes. The city that General Sherman thought\
  \ was too beautiful to burn is covered in stately old homes and neatly laid-out\
  \ squares, begging you to sit down and fan the humidity away for a minute. The click\
  \ clack of shoes on cobblestone match the clatter of the horse-drawn carriages,\
  \ transporting tourists to another time. And I just can\u2019t get enough of those\
  \ moss-covered trees. We should really think about getting some of that tropical\
  \ beauty up north.\n\nSo, if home is where the heart is, am I Southern now? I\u2019\
  ve eaten the prerequisite tomatoes, developed an appreciation for the practicalities\
  \ of the word y\u2019all, and know that sugar goes in tea and not cornbread. In\
  \ fact, after I\u2019ve had my fill of the big city, I might even consider moving\
  \ to a community outside of the Northeast or West Coast, bless my heart.\n\nNo place\
  \ is without its faults. The good-ole boy network is strong in Savannah. My mom\
  \ was furious when a business group\u2019s email chain instructed the women to pick\
  \ out the cake for an upcoming event. And one of the most terrifying signs I\u2019\
  ve ever seen was outside a coffee shop, barring entry for those carrying concealed\
  \ weapons. It had not occurred to me that the person passing by on the street could\
  \ be armed and ready. In hindsight, maybe I should have smiled back when they said\
  \ hello.\n\nThere are many things that we do not miss about California. The foggy\
  \ summers at the beach match the frigid water. And ultimately the lack of affordable\
  \ housing, anywhere in the massive state, pushed us out and we have no intention\
  \ of moving back.\n\nWe are still adjusting. My dad\u2019s favorite joke \u2013\
  \ \u201Cwell, at least I\u2019m not as fat as that guy\u201D - is no longer relevant\
  \ as he is now one of the slimmest middle-aged men in the room. However, his delight\
  \ in pointing that out when dining at a fried chicken emporium, with families enjoying\
  \ their dinner on either side, did not endear us to anyone.\n\nTravel, whether in\
  \ the form of a two week vacation or a parents\u2019 cross country move, is a gradual,\
  \ transformative experience. I don\u2019t remember when I changed my mind about\
  \ the charms of the Old South. I am just thankful it happened. I\u2019m a better\
  \ person for it."
