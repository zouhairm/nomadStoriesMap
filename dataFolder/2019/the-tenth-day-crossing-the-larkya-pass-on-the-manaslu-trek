Text: "We wake at three in the morning. At breakfast, the lights aren\u2019t on because\
  \ the generator can\u2019t power the dining room and kitchen at the same time. The\
  \ tight space is a blinding mess of head torches where it is difficult to see your\
  \ own food. I eat half a bowl of Tsampa, Tibetan barley porridge, and half a piece\
  \ of Tibetan bread with jam. The Tsampa is for strength- at our guide Ram\u2019\
  s suggestion. The sugary bread is just for my sweet tooth. \nBy half past four we\
  \ are ready to begin. Ram leads us, but the night sky has its own beacons for us\
  \ to follow. The moon, not quite full, is ahead of us. Orion sits to our left. The\
  \ morning star at our back, bright and clear above Shyala\u2019s pointed cap. The\
  \ route follows a rocky crease in the landscape, which undulates like bony knuckles.\
  \ The rocks, covered in pale lichen, are the same colour as the snow that lies like\
  \ discarded quilts by the path. Frozen lakes glow light blue in the moonlight. \n\
  The cold is biting- even with the thick down jacket and multiple layers beneath.\
  \ My nose is running constantly and I keep pulling my fingers out of the gloves\
  \ to bunch them into a fist.  \nDawn begins as a faint glow over the range behind\
  \ us. Then the light, golden and new, touches the peaks ahead of us, slowly trickling\
  \ down from the summit like honey poured over meringue. At last the rays of daybreak\
  \ reach us, and just as they do, we stumble upon a delightful surprise: Larke Teashop.\
  \ The little building is stone, blending in with its surroundings, but the crowd\
  \ massing around it gives it away. We sit in the sun and drink ginger lemon tea,\
  \ listening to the tunes of some Nepali music coming from a radio in the house.\
  \ From his seat on a boulder, with the steel cup grasped between his hands, Ram\
  \ sings along. \nAfter this break, the terrain becomes more otherworldly. The path\
  \ is invisible in the rocky moraine, and the stones coat the land as a white rubble.\
  \ The only vegetation is a dry crimson shrub that nestles between the boulders.\
  \ Grey glaciers and ice falls crouch in the corrugations of the mountains. The moon\
  \ hangs there, above what could almost pass for its own surface, though soon it\
  \ drops away. We reach a larger frozen lake, our boots leaving footprints on its\
  \ sandy beach. The ice is solid, the colour of old porcelain, with crackle glaze\
  \ to match. \nFrom up the hill, a mule train appears, suddenly, hurriedly, but with\
  \ no herders. In a surreal scene, the beasts clatter across the flat surface of\
  \ the lake and come to a halt on an island of sand in its centre. Most of them are\
  \ loaded with sacks, and although we wait for some time by the lake, no one comes\
  \ to fetch them. \nAbove the bleached landscape, the sky is a profound blue. Fierce,\
  \ bright, and deep, unlike any I\u2019ve seen before. As though the world were saying,\
  \ here is all the blue there ever was, and all the blue you will ever see again,\
  \ caught in this one day. Then if tomorrow I were to wake and the colour had been\
  \ stolen from the universe, it would be alright- I would have seen it all already,\
  \ seen enough to last a lifetime. \nAfter the porcelain lake, Ram guides us up a\
  \ pathless slope. Unexpectedly, we come across a mess of rainbow. Prayer flags everywhere,\
  \ strung across the rocks and lying in tangled piles on the ground. A stone shelter\
  \ that has three walls and no roof. Trekkers, guides, and porters mill about, taking\
  \ photos and chatting. This is Larkya La, the highest point of our trek. The pass\
  \ sits in a saddle between Chio Himal and Larke Peak, beside the rambling folds\
  \ of ice and gravel which make up the Larke Glacier. A hand painted sign jammed\
  \ between two rocks reads:\n\nLARKE PASS (5106M)\nTHANK YOU FOR MANASLU VISIT\n\
  SEE YOU AGAIN\n\nI\u2019m too ecstatic to notice the slight headache brought on\
  \ by high altitude. \nWe have made it."
