Text: "The days on the calendar passes by as a reminder not only of what we could\
  \ have beeen/ will be,  but also of what we are giving up to fulfill borrowed objetives.\
  \ Regardless of our ethnical and cultural background, at the end of the day we are\
  \ all wondering what we came to this life for. So we find an ideal and we fight\
  \ for it: feminism, politics, climate change, human rights. All altruist ways of\
  \ the high & medium class to clean that feeling of being born in a position of privilege\
  \ without knowing if we actually deserves it.\nAt this point of life where we are\
  \ deconstructing what we are in order to give the adulthood a chance, we tend to\
  \ put in doubt every choise that have been made in the past for or by us. From family\
  \ until friends, work and connections. We wonder if we could fit in any ideal and\
  \ then be highlighted as a good lover, friend, worker, son, sister, parent. \nTo\
  \ travel is to have the chance of playing a secret game when no limits are put for\
  \ the players. It gives you the sense of a fresh start. We can introduce ourselves\
  \ as we feel we are and simply let our best attributes to make our days magical.\
  \ Without expectations to reach, impressions to make or prejudices to fight against.\
  \ Therefore, our stories becomes our thoughts, our thoughts becomes our actions\
  \ and our actions shape the routine we took in the first place. \nBeing said that,\
  \ I wonder if by spending 350 days saving money to travel 15 with the pretext of\
  \ discovering  new horizons, we forget that these feeling of \u201Csaudade\u201D\
  \ that Lisboa emanates is for anything else but us returning our actual and only\
  \ home: self awareness.\nWe travel not only for the pictures we take but for the\
  \ memory we have of ourselves living those moments without recipes to follow."
