Text: "Concrete hotels with wifi stood beside wooden sheds. As a bus revved, horses\
  \ and mules grazed nearby. Gumgadhi was a strange town, and I seemed to have caught\
  \ it right in the middle of its transformation. \nGumgadhi is in Karnali, a remote\
  \ northwestern region of Nepal below the Himalayas. It used to take months to walk\
  \ there, but recent constructions had changed that, and I had ridden a bus there\
  \ from southern Nepal. \nNot just Karnali's towns but its people too were transforming.\
  \ Women dressed in colorful fariyas and antique coin necklaces carried sacks of\
  \ cement. Later I saw them smoking, and apparently laughing at me.\n\u201CJust want\
  \ to wear pants like you,\u201D one of them giggled.\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t you?\u201D\
  \ I giggled back.\n\u201CMy husband will beat me when he's back from the field!\u201D\
  \ I couldn\u2019t figure out if she was serious. I settled on 'sarcastic'.\n\u201C\
  If you have fields, why do you labour, carrying sacks of cement?\u201D\n\u201CTo\
  \ pay for his drinks\u2026\u201D she sighed. \u201CHusbands these days are worthless!\u201D\
  \ This time she was serious.\nShe began singing it out, her voice ringing around\
  \ the valley, rising and falling with her emotions.\nOh poor one\nMy heart sways\
  \ wildly\nMy destiny is faulty\nGoosebumps rose on my skin as others joined her.\
  \ Here, everyone was a superstar. Because they did not have televisions or cinema\
  \ halls. They were not yet told what they felt. So they expressed what they really\
  \ felt.\nPeople of Karnali held their emotions and stories dear. In Sinja valley,\
  \ with Karnali river meandering through miles of paddy fields, people spoke of treasures.\n\
  \u201CThis is where old princes lived,\u201D said one, pointing to ruins, and then\
  \ caves: \u201Cthere they hid from enemies.\u201D\n\u201CMy neighbor found a box\
  \ full of old metal treasures in his fields!\u201D said another.  \nYou may not\
  \ be inclined to believe these stories. Until you visit Kanaka Sundari temple, a\
  \ crumbling mud structure full of neglected stone panes. Devotees digging around\
  \ for a new temple found buried statues. Since everyone wanted them, they were taken\
  \ to the police station and locked up.\nI walked to the police station. \u201CWhat\
  \ a day this is! When devotees have to visit their gods in jail!\u201D said a local\
  \ woman as a policeman opened a wooden box.\nOut came five statues, no more than\
  \ a foot tall. Three of them were almost whole: Hindu deities Indra, Sachi, and\
  \ Vishnu. I stared and started at their delicate poses, peaceful faces, heights\
  \ of imagination and artistry.\nIn Kathmandu, they would be prized in temples thronging\
  \ with devotees. Elsewhere they would be venerated in museums. In Karnali they languish\
  \ in a police station.\nGlumly I walked to the bus stop, through a village hours\
  \ away from roads, clearly built for pedestrians. Houses stood on top of one another:\
  \ you had to walk up the courtyard of one, through the living room of another, down\
  \ the kitchen of another and so on, ascending and descending bamboo ladders at odd\
  \ angles. \nI was hit by an aching sense of loss as I realised that all this may\
  \ be gone. There will be roads everywhere, the village of ladders will be replaced\
  \ by standalone buildings. People will not walk through each other\u2019s homes.\
  \ Ruins will be built on, and no one will think of them as magical connections to\
  \ myths. Televisions and cinemas will air new songs, and people will stop making\
  \ up their own. Nobody will bother gods at police stations.\nFor a girl who had\
  \ never known a place connected to her myths, songs passed down through generations,\
  \ or jewelry hundreds of years old, the trip was a journey back in time. \nA longing\
  \ for unknown roots filled me completely: Hiraeth, a homesickness for a lost home,\
  \ or a home that never was. I just wanted to close my eyes and stay right there.\
  \ This place seemed incredibly precious, and people incredibly lucky. \nI sighed,\
  \ because I was romanticizing as an outsider, and perhaps the people of Karnali\
  \ preferred roads that made life easier, over this sentimental nonsense. I took\
  \ the bus back home, forever tinged with the magic of a land where dreamy landscape\
  \ came alive with stories."
