Text: "The Single Place I\u2019ll never Visit Again\n\nHere, in my treasured shelter,\
  \ it\u2019s all and always dark. It\u2019s also humid, very humid to the extent\
  \ of wetness. Yet, it\u2019s always warm: in the range of 37 Celsius, so it\u2019\
  s probably considered hot, not warm. Nonetheless I like it very much, and it feels\
  \ as cozy as a home. After all, I\u2019ve been locked up here for months now, so\
  \ it really started feeling like home. Despite that, I can\u2019t exactly say where\
  \ on earth I am. Honestly, I'm not entirely sure how I got here in the first place.\
  \ But believe me, it\u2019s nice, snug, comfy, and very close to the heart. A place\
  \ to stay at for a lifetime, except, it is tightening and getting smaller by the\
  \ day. What is growing bigger, however, is my restlessness. \n\nFor some time now,\
  \ I hear my provider calling me, intermittently, but consistently. I feel the eagerness\
  \ in her voice, but also sense her weariness. She has been taking care of me for\
  \ the past weeks, and we go along very well. Even so, I don\u2019t miss noticing\
  \ the hint of fear in her cries. Because I like her a lot, let alone how dependent\
  \ I am on her, I start contemplating answering her calls. The best part of me wants\
  \ me to get out of here and meet her in daylight. But I\u2019m no less frightened\
  \ and don\u2019t know how to overcome my fear. To the best of my judgment, it\u2019\
  s hostile out there: noisy, cold, lots of talking on hard-to-understand matters,\
  \ and above all, mysterious. There is, from time to time, some tranquility, maybe\
  \ with a bit of music; but soon after, sounds of machines storm in. \n\nBeing very\
  \ worn-out by waiting, though not knowing for what, I finally take the hard decision\
  \ to answer her calls. The moment I did and started moving, the whole place shook,\
  \ and it felt as if it\u2019s crumpling. Water is now seeping out. I too try to\
  \ slip, only to realize that I\u2019m moving from an already narrow cavity into\
  \ even a tighter one. It\u2019s becoming very noisy now with the outer voices drawing\
  \ closer and stronger than usual. Among the several voices, one male\u2019s voice\
  \ attracts my attention. He sounds confused, worried, but somehow encouraging. I\
  \ hear him talking to my provider in a very caring tone, and at times, addressing\
  \ me with inviting and welcoming salutations. Many years later, I came to understand\
  \ that he too was my provider.\n\nWith my entire valor, I let myself, or I\u2019\
  d rather say force myself, to follow the tempo of the chorus of voices. I squeeze\
  \ my body, head first, into the only opening in the walls of my chamber. It\u2019\
  s so dark and tight that it\u2019s more of a dark passageway than an open door.\
  \ Filled with fear of the unknown, I close my eyes, clench my fists, hold my breath,\
  \ and gather all my will and courage to release my body, by pushing. With my sense\
  \ of time lost, or rather never acquired, it felt it\u2019s never ending.\n\nThen,\
  \ all of a sudden, my provider lets out a long loud cry; a cry I could hear reverberating,\
  \ in here and out there. An echoing sigh follows, then a moment of utter silence.\
  \ I too don\u2019t feel any more my body to be squeezed, or warm. And just before\
  \ I open my eyes, I get a slap on my back. I start crying, but don\u2019t hear my\
  \ voice because applauds and cheerful cries fill my ears. My provider, the tender-voiced\
  \ man, and few others are cheering my arrival, and welcoming me out of my cell.\
  \ Wrapped with warmth and a familiar scent, I open my eyes. This must be my provider\u2019\
  s face. I smile.  \n\nThis is the story of my first journey. Its ending is, by far,\
  \ the best; as not only it delivered me to the real world, it did something a little\
  \ more: it gave me a name, and put me on a much longer journey of becoming who I\
  \ am. One painful ending that turned into a fortunate whole beginning."
