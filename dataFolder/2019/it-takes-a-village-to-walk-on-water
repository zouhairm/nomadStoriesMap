Text: "After an hour of negotiations with the hotel\u2019s staff over Google Translate,\
  \ at 11 p.m. we finally got in a reasonably-priced cab. The Chinese New Year was\
  \ in its peak in the southern Vietnamese city of Nha Trang, where I had landed the\
  \ day before. I was excited to leave its scooter-infested streets to the flocks\
  \ of Russian tourists and not lose another day of kitesurfing. I had to learn \u2026\
  \ this time around.\n\nI was making my second pilgrimage to the My Hoa lagoon, near\
  \ the town of Phan Rang. I first visited a month earlier to spend the holidays with\
  \ my partner. He had decided to stay and learn kiting at the Phan Rang Kite Center.\
  \ Friends introduced him to the serenity of this flat-water spot, one of just a\
  \ few in Vietnam, where you can find only a road and a few kite schools in contrast\
  \ to the nearby surfing resort of Mui Ne. He arranged kitesurfing lessons for me,\
  \ but my time ran out before I could even stand up on the board.\n\nTucked away\
  \ in the cab, I was grateful to be back next to the person I love. I was excited\
  \ to hang out again with passionate kitesurfers from all over the world over banana\
  \ milkshakes in the mornings and Saigon beers at night. They\u2019d talk about future\
  \ and past adventures, their home countries, the tricks they pulled and the war\
  \ wounds they got while kiting during the day.\n\nI was anxious to go back in the\
  \ warm, thiel waters. Would I get up on the board this time? \n\nIn the first morning\
  \ of gracious winds, I dropped by the courtyard/restaurant of our guesthouse. I\
  \ pointed at the English translation of the laminated one-page menu to ask our smiley\
  \ hosts for a cup of coffee, served with condensed milk. I enjoyed my wake-up treat\
  \ while catching up with a Swiss banker, a veteran in kitesurfing. While I was gone,\
  \ he\u2019d managed to break his ribs during a kiting session. \n\nWith that positive\
  \ outlook in my head, I went over to the school at 1 p.m. sharp. My Swedish instructor\
  \ had told me the water would be deep enough then, which meant ankle-deep that day.\
  \ He gave me a 7-meter kite, i.e. the wind was gnarly, but I had only a few days\
  \ to stand up on that board, so I got in. \n\nI lay down in the water; put my feet\
  \ in the straps; steered the kite up, down ... and up; gained power; stood up; forgot\
  \ to move my legs; gloriously FELL on my face; got vehemently dragged in the shallow\
  \ water; scraped on corals; bumped into rocks; stayed hydrated with seawater.  \n\
  \nLather, rinse, repeat. \u201CAsshole,\u201D I yelled at the kite on the 15th fall.\
  \ It almost strangled me with its lines on the next one. \u201CLet\u2019s work together,\
  \ buddy,\u201D I then pleaded while hyperventilating. In response, the kite lifted\
  \ me a few meters in the air until I remembered to release. Splash! I kissed the\
  \ water. \u201CThank God for the helmet,\u201D I mumbled; the only memento of the\
  \ crash was a juicy bruise on my thigh.\n\nI conceded for the day. Limping out of\
  \ the water, I stewed in the disappointment with my fear. \n\nBack on shore, everything\
  \ got better. My instructor praised me for persevering in the rough conditions.\
  \ My partner poked my bruises to tease me, but gave me the pep talk I needed. Later,\
  \ in the kite center next door, we shared a few shots and a few good stories with\
  \ surfers from 11 countries. I, the kiting toddler, also had war wounds to brag\
  \ with now. \n\nI got in the water the next day, not on the board. More disappointment\
  \ followed, more support too. On Day 3, I stood on that board and glided a few meters\
  \ across the water. \u201CI am doing it!\u201D I shrieked before \u201Cdiving\u201D\
  \ to gulp a salty cocktail spiked with seaweed. \n\nTwo days later, I was out of\
  \ time again. \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of places to kite at, but I hope the second\
  \ time was not my last time in the My Hoa lagoon where I enjoyed a communal, yet\
  \ cosmopolitan, wicked good time."
