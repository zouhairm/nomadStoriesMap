Text: "In Havana, Big Brother has a name: Che Guevara.\_\n\nThe dead man's face stares\
  \ out from every street corner, adorning surfaces from colossal billboards to age-worn\
  \ posters. A single portrait, mirrored over and over\u200A -\u200A dishevelled hair\
  \ spilling out of a military beret, hard eyes focused on some enemy out of sight.\n\
  \nAlberto Korda's famous picture of the revolutionary is said to be the most reproduced\
  \ photograph of all time, and yet the sheer ubiquity of the image in Cuba is striking.\
  \ Che's presence is palpable from the cobblestone streets of Old Havana to the sea-swept\
  \ Malec\xF3n boardwalk. I remember a weather-beaten veteran of the cruise ship jetty,\
  \ hawking t-shirts with Che's face and a revolutionary slogan of your choice. The\
  \ man's sales pitch to me was illuminating: \"With this shirt, you will remember\
  \ Havana.\"\n\nMy bedroom in a casa particular (a Cuban homestay) had already given\
  \ me a sense of the salesman's truth. Images of Che were plastered across the wall\
  \ like he belonged to a boy band. I hadn't slept well on my first night in that\
  \ room \u200A -\u200AI put it down to the laughter and pulsing Latin pop leaking\
  \ in from the street, but it also took me some time to adjust to the omnipresence\
  \ of a dead war hero.\_\n\nIn George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, Big Brother\
  \ is the personification of the totalitarian ruling party. There is a certain similarity\
  \ with the way Che is lionised by the Cuban government, treated as the embodiment\
  \ of socialist grit and its ultimate triumph. I noted with interest that it was\
  \ Che\u200A - \u200Aand not Fidel Castro\u200A - \u200Awho adorned the walls of\
  \ Havana. Like in Orwell's world, Cuba's government has preferred a stylised fiction:\
  \ here, the archetype of a revolutionary martyr.\n\nBut no character in Nineteen\
  \ Eighty-Four willingly covered their home's walls with pictures of Big Brother\
  \ in the manner of my host family. The Cuban government might have put up the billboards\
  \ of Che, but the posters belong to the people.\n\nMy obsession with Che's iconography\
  \ grew each day I walked Havana's streets, stepping\u200A - \u200Aseemingly \u200A\
  - \u200Aback through time. Crumbling colonial-era buildings are a feature of most\
  \ neighbourhoods, left to succumb to the ravages of time. Naval forts dating back\
  \ to the nascent Spanish empire line the seaside. Even Cuba's grandest building,\
  \ the Museo de la Revoluci\xF3n, is ridden with bullet holes from a revolutionary\
  \ gunfight. Maybe the deification of a long-dead historical figure is only to be\
  \ expected in a city that is itself a monument to history? A symbol of past glory\
  \ to fortify the resolve of a people struggling in the present, perhaps. The weaponisation\
  \ of adulation.\n\nWhat became abundantly clear is that Che ceased to be a human\
  \ being long ago, replaced by the canvas of Alberto Korda's portrait. Che's image\
  \ has proliferated so widely that his very identity has been subsumed: to love Che\
  \ is to love Cuba; and to love Cuba is to love Che. To me, this posed a contradiction.\
  \ Without irony, my host family would praise the revolutionary hero while simultaneously\
  \ negotiating for medicine on the black market. Conversing with locals at a restaurant,\
  \ I heard a myriad of problems afflicting Cuba, and just how little faith there\
  \ was in the government to fix them. It is fascinating that an erosion of confidence\
  \ in the Communist party could do so little to harm the reputation of a man pivotal\
  \ to its rise.\_\n\nMore than anything else, it is these shades of cognitive dissonance\
  \ that made Che's visual presence in Havana so distinctive. The man that was Che\
  \ Guevara has been distilled to a symbol as fictional as Nineteen Eighty-Four's\
  \ Big Brother, but unifying in a manner quite unlike Orwell's creation.\n\nWhen\
  \ I booked my trip to Havana, I was prepared for a place dissimilar to anything\
  \ I had seen before. But I didn't expect to find myself losing sleep over a dead\
  \ revolutionary icon. I left Cuba with the thought that the lionisation of Che Guevara\
  \ speaks to the state of Havana today: a city moored by the ballast of its history."
