Text: "I moved to a remote Ecuadorean community near the border of Colombia with excitement\
  \ and an eagerness to learn and to help. The official reason I relocated was to\
  \ finish a research paper for my program. On a personal level, I was hoping to gain\
  \ clarity on what I wanted to do in my future. Before this placement I had no idea\
  \ what to do post-University, and that was terrifying. \n\nI chose to work with\
  \ an organization that helped immigrants and refugees resettle and begin to rebuild\
  \ their lives. After a week of moving throughout the office trying to find who was\
  \ doing the most interesting task that I could observe or help with, I was late\
  \ leaving the office one afternoon and walked by a small group of youth huddled\
  \ around a tiny laptop. I recognized them as some of the youth that spent most of\
  \ their days at the organization, so I went over. One of the girls was working on\
  \ an online English course, trying to finish a University degree that she had started\
  \ before leaving her home in Venezuela. I immediately offered my help. She was ecstatic\
  \ that someone who spoke English was helping her; it was a fairly hard course. I\
  \ myself got a few of the questions wrong, which was slightly embarrassing and very\
  \ difficult to explain to them that the English language quite simply does not make\
  \ sense. Yet, we made it through her quizzes, joking along the way, and called it\
  \ a day. Thus, unexpectedly, a beautiful friendship blossomed. \n\nOur friendship\
  \ made sense on a basic level: we were both females around the same age and outsiders\
  \ living in a community where we were both eager to be, but felt we did not belong.\
  \ The only barrier we faced was that neither of us spoke the others' language fluently.\
  \ We got around that easily enough, with me speaking Spanish to her and her speaking\
  \ English to me. We likely sounded crazy, but we were both learning and having fun\
  \ while doing it; it worked for us. We became quick friends and spent most of our\
  \ free time together. \n\nIn a small community with barely a mestizo in sight, I\
  \ stood out. Yet somehow, I did not seem to stand out as much as my new friend.\
  \ Apparently to a trained eye, one look at her was all that it took to recognize\
  \ her as an outsider. While I had grown used to that in Ecuador, due to having a\
  \ minority skin colour, I was shocked that being from a mere two countries over\
  \ made her features recognizable enough as somebody not welcome. Putting two unwelcome\
  \ outsiders together made us into a very-easily-stoppable duo. One day we were walking\
  \ around trying to find a gym to join together. There were two gyms within walking\
  \ distance of our houses. The first one that we went to would not even allow us\
  \ to come in. The manager looked down at us and blocked the door, saying they only\
  \ allowed women in the gym one day a week. This was strange, as she was a woman,\
  \ and we could see other women in there. She then claimed there were no memberships\
  \ available at this time. Before I could say anything, my new friend started to\
  \ pull me away, with a shamefully sad look on her face. As we walked away she explained\
  \ to me that we weren't allowed in because it was obvious that neither one of us\
  \ were from there. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Being from Canada, this was the first\
  \ time I had been denied something because of my skin colour, but for her it was\
  \ normal. Two gyms later we found a small place that allowed us in. Together we\
  \ worked out, practiced each other's language and had a great time.  \n\nBeing two\
  \ outsiders sharing new experiences together over several months, both good and\
  \ bad, bonded us and to this day we still keep in touch. While it breaks my heart\
  \ that she has not yet been able to return home to Venezuela, I do plan to visit\
  \ Nori very soon and we both cannot wait to reconnect."
