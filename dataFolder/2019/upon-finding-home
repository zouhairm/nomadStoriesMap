Text: "For 24 years of my life, I felt as though I did not belong in my city. I knew\
  \ there was always some place for me, I just could not find it. When I turned 24,\
  \ these thoughts took a toll on me. I did not want to work in my city, meet people,\
  \ socialize or step out of the house. I wanted to move, find the place that had\
  \ always been calling out to me. Through a leap of faith, I decided to try my luck\
  \ in London. I have always been an introvert and in the society that I come from,\
  \ people found it strange that I would want to go to a global city and make a life.\
  \ So I did.\n\nThe minute I stepped out of Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport, I remember\
  \ telling my mother that I have found my city. It was a perfect London day, misty\
  \ rain and grey cloudy sky. I moved into a studio in Stockwell, South London. Being\
  \ the first time living by myself, I was confused, figuring out commute, laundry\
  \ cycles and room cleaning schedules. Once this fell into place, I started exploring\
  \ the city. I found the closest commercial area was Brixton, which also happened\
  \ to be the most notorious. My first few times in Brixton, my hands were always\
  \ in my pocket, clenching my cellphone on one side and wallet on the other. Eventually,\
  \ I began to notice that everyone in Brixton knew one another. They were happy,\
  \ friendly people always willing to help and have a conversation. I wandered further\
  \ into Brixton into the so-called dangerous areas of Market Row and Electric Avenue\
  \ and it still was the same. \n\nBeing confined to the introvert box all my life,\
  \ I amused myself by the number of friends I made in London and with what ease.\
  \ These were my kind of people, sharing the exact same ideas and sense of humour.\
  \ Commuting in London is simple and fun, you are never more than 5 minutes away\
  \ from a tube station or a bus stop. This gave me the confidence to explore every\
  \ part of the city. I would start my mornings at the University College London Library,\
  \ get lunch in Exmouth Market and go for classes in Hackney Wick. Some weekends\
  \ I would spend scavenging through books at the Southbank Book Market and on others\
  \ go for a Sunday Roast at Snooty Fox. \n\nSeveral months of living in London and\
  \ previously being a person with stage fright, I started conducting audio and walking\
  \ tours through South London. I interacted with people from different cultural backgrounds\
  \ through these and was often lost in their world and stories. I found myself actively\
  \ participating in public meetings and seminars and was wonderstruck by how London\
  \ had changed me. \n\nTwo years of living here and I have walked all the streets\
  \ in Central London and I am still curiously exploring its suburbs. Presently due\
  \ to Brexit, with protests, processions and diversions, even though the city is\
  \ not at its best, I am sure it will be home again to many. I may have to leave\
  \ this year, but it will always be my home. A place where I found myself."
