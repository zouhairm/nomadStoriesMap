Text: "Previously concealed by the impenetrable, grizzled buckbrush hedges lining\
  \ this once deserted road, another pilgrim appears. Our eyes instantly meet - his\
  \ widening, taking in my sudden appearance; mouth gaping to form a soundless \u201C\
  O\u201D. A lamb who\u2019s strayed too far from the herd, coming face to face with\
  \ a wolf. \n\nShock. \n\nHe pauses momentarily, adding a minuscule shake of his\
  \ head. Efforts to remove any doubt I am a mirage, manifested of a wandering mind\
  \ on this barren Spanish Meseta. My presence persisting, his brows furrow. \n\n\
  Confusion.    \n\nRival to an owl, his head swivels - glancing behind, then towards\
  \ me again. Eyes now desperately probing; seeking confirmation to an unspoken question.\n\
  \nPanic. \n\nFrantically, he scans the trail ahead - gaze settling on a cement pillar\
  \ hosting a yellow scallop shell facing his direction. A visible exhale follows,\
  \ releasing the breath unknowingly held since my arrival.\n\nRelief.\n\nConfidence\
  \ fully restored in his prevailing direction, the usual pilgrim greeting of \u201C\
  Buen Camino\u201D is abandoned. In its place, I find myself accused: \u201CYou\u2019\
  re going the wrong way!\u201D\n\nAmused, I sift through potential responses to his\
  \ assured allegation. Being cheeky I could mirror his reactions; insist with unwavering\
  \ persistence that HE is the one going the wrong way\u2026 Or, channeling the spiritualism\
  \ shrouding this route, I could stare off into the distance spouting a theological\
  \ affirmation, before vanishing down the trail. Those who follow their hearts are\
  \ seldom astray\u2026\n\nNever one skilled in the dramatic arts, I settle for a\
  \ direct response.  Flaunting my expansive two-word Spanish vocabulary I reply,\
  \ \u201CYo regreso, I am not going to Santiago!\u201D \n\nHis recovered confidence\
  \ ebbs, as if my statement poses a perplexing riddle. One questioning syllable escapes\
  \ his lips: \u201CWhy?\u201D\n\nFor the past seven weeks, I have walked the Camino\
  \ de Santiago: an ancient Christian pilgrimage route to the resting place of Saint\
  \ James in the City of Santiago, Spain. Encompassing trails from all corners of\
  \ Europe to this holy destination: my journey began in Lisbon, trekking north via\
  \ the Camino Portuguese way. After 31 days I had reached Santiago, but far from\
  \ road-weary I ventured onwards. Guided by the stars of the milky way I headed east,\
  \ walking the \u201Cwrong way\u201D on the most populous long-distance hiking route\
  \ in the world: the Camino Frances.\n\nA route of 800 kilometers spanning across\
  \ northern Spain and into France: over 25,000 pilgrims would traverse the Camino\
  \ Frances to Santiago during my time on its trail. Of these thousands, I find myself\
  \ an anomaly. My course confounding to even the most seasoned Camino goers; this\
  \ recent pilgrim is not alone in his query of \u201CWhy?\u201D. \n\nNearing the\
  \ halfway point on this route, my response is refined to a simple; yet probing question.\
  \ \u201CHow else did pilgrims centuries ago get home, except returning the way they\
  \ came?\u201D\n\nAn understanding seeps into my counterpart\u2019s features - stumbling\
  \ onto this hidden truth of the Camino, buried beneath the modern luxury of sprinting\
  \ home from one\u2019s destination by planes, trains, and automobiles.  To our pilgrim\
  \ forebears, Santiago was only ever a midpoint; their journey home half the adventure.\
  \  \n                                                                          \
  \                                                                              \
  \                                                                              \
  \  \nWe linger, chatting a few moments more; the afternoon sun beginning its descent\
  \ towards the westward horizon beckoning my acquaintance onward. Though we walk\
  \ the same road, his footsteps follow hundreds before that day; mine continuing\
  \ solo on their counter course. Neither of our crusades a proverbial walk in the\
  \ park - pilgrimages never are, but that is where our similarities reach a dead-end.\
  \ \n\nAhead, his journey will be accompanied by a growing fellowship of familiar\
  \ faces; guidebooks and painstakingly placed signposts lighting a righteous course.\
  \ For me, a sea of new faces, and misleading way-markers, rarely guiding my backwards\
  \ way forward lie ahead. All too often finding myself pondering a fork in the road\
  \ as Alice in Wonderland - but no Cheshire Cat ever appearing, I am left to inquire\
  \ the faint impressions of footprints on hard-packed dirt, \u201CWhich way I ought\
  \ to go from here?\u201D \n\nOn this, the most well-trodden trail on earth, I have\
  \ found the road less traveled. Without death-defying feats or forsaking all creature\
  \ comforts, I have made a leap into the unknown - simply by daring to be a little\
  \ backwards, and going the \u201Cwrong way.\u201D"
