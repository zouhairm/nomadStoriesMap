Text: "\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D It\u2019s rude to ask a stranger anything but\
  \ this question first in my culture. This should be asked even before your name.\n\
  \nBut where you\u2019re from isn\u2019t answered as a country or the town you grew\
  \ up in, it\u2019s the place where your ancestors first stepped foot and settled,\
  \ where they built their first homes and where they are buried. I am from \u014C\
  taua, a place that has more thistle bushes then people, but the people are much\
  \ pricklier than the thistle bushes.\n\nI was born and raised in a city that is\
  \ dominated by foreigners. The M\u0101ori people are a small population trying to\
  \ cling to our traditions and language as they dissolve in our hands and tongues.\
  \ I am ignorant to my own culture and I do not even possess the beautiful copper\
  \ coloured skin of my people, but I still knew where I belonged and a few years\
  \ back I made the trek home.\n\nMost maraes I had visited had carvings on the outside\
  \ but Pukerata marae had none. It was old, plain and we weren\u2019t even allowed\
  \ inside the original marae instead staying in the rebuilt wharenui Te Rau Tawainui.\
  \ It was across from the urupa and surrounded by nothing but bush and trees and\
  \ small bodies of water for miles. \n \nThere was a waterfall on my nanny\u2019\
  s land that was mere metres away from the road but took almost an hour to get to\
  \ through the thick underbrush as the land grew wild without supervision. Rays of\
  \ sunlight burst through the canopy and made the ngahere, the forest, feel otherworldly.\n\
  \nI felt I could live here. This was home after all and home was beautiful, and\
  \ it felt like the whole forest, birds and insects, welcomed me. But the people\
  \ did not. \n\nThey looked at my pale skin as I told them my diminutive name, forgoing\
  \ my full M\u0101ori name that no one in the city could say out of habit. And as\
  \ my tongue stuttered over M\u0101ori words, the people grew slightly colder, polite\
  \ in the way you\u2019d be to someone who didn\u2019t know any better, like a child\
  \ or more accurately, like a foreigner who wasn\u2019t going to be there long. They\
  \ thought I was a tourist.\n\nAnd they were right. I was a person who didn\u2019\
  t know the land or the people, even if I was related. I didn\u2019t really know\
  \ the language or culture and I wasn\u2019t staying no matter what I had imagined\
  \ while standing in the ngahere. I was so whakam\u0101, so ashamed, that I keep\
  \ silent to that fact that I was M\u0101ori and I was from the very place I stood.\n\
  \nBut along with shame, I also felt a sense of determination, I experiences such\
  \ a deep shame over my ignorance that it fuelled me to try to connect. Not just\
  \ with my own culture, but with others and now every time I travel to a new place,\
  \ I make sure to get to know a little of the culture and a little of the language\
  \ as I connect with the people who call it home. And I proudly call myself a tourist,\
  \ someone who experiences and learns what makes places great, even if that place\
  \ is home."
