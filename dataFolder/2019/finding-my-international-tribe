Text: "I'm not a very prayerful person. But as I stood on the corner of Dame and St.\
  \ George at 3:30am, I closed my eyes and prayed. I ached for a moment of calm that\
  \ wouldn\u2019t come. The blinking light mocking me: Don\u2019t Walk. Don\u2019\
  t Walk. Joke\u2019s on you, light; I\u2019m not moving. Our group went from four\
  \ to three in the beep of that walk signal and we had no idea where Elly was. \n\
  \nIt\u2019s my final night in Dublin with my hostel mates Eliza, Elly and Justine.\
  \ They wanted to do the Backpacker Pub Crawl together, but I\u2019m no drinker so\
  \ I had to be talked into it. I am the responsible one, after all, so I had to keep\
  \ watch!\n\nWe felt like we owned Dublin: singing, dancing in the streets, people\
  \ taking our pictures. Elly, who confessed to hating crowds and had a penchant for\
  \ escaping, had us spending half the night tailing her. We tried to stay close to\
  \ our increasingly drunk friend, but we were tired of chasing her. Our guide reminded\
  \ us at every location not to wander alone so we started to first look outside on\
  \ curbs and doorways for her before getting annoyed. \n\nFinally, dead phones and\
  \ dead tired, it\u2019s closing time. We had a mile walk back to the hostel still.\
  \ Elly had latched on to a group leaving with us, and as we hit a four way stop\
  \ she ran across Dame street with them, leaving Justine, Eliza and me behind. During\
  \ a break in freshly released pub traffic the crowd dispersed and we noticed that\
  \ Elly was not waiting on the other side. I was certain I saw her cross the street\
  \ ahead of us not twenty seconds before. Didn\u2019t I?\n\nWe ran over to some of\
  \ the other groups to see if they\u2019d seen her. Nobody had. We called out for\
  \ her. Nothing. One drunk got physical by shoving us away. Did he meet El?  Did\
  \ he hurt her? Is she injured? She was walking slowly earlier, maybe she stopped\
  \ and we hadn\u2019t noticed. But we would notice, wouldn\u2019t we?\n\nI internally\
  \ began to panic but wanted to appear calm. \u201CDid we miss her?\u201D we questioned\
  \ ourselves. We erred on the side of it being another disappearing act based on\
  \ how often she\u2019d left us during the night without thinking. The three of us\
  \ decided to split up for a few blocks, ominous streets be damned. A police car\
  \ screamed past us and turned down St. George street, the same direction Eliza started\
  \ walking. My aching feet stopped dead to see her run down the street behind them,\
  \ the panic forming like bile in my throat. As I moved east I looked in curbs and\
  \ doorways for a hunched over lump that might be Elly. Not knowing if she walked\
  \ off or was escorted, walking alone in the dark made me feel exposed. I walked\
  \ as far as I dared before turning back to our corner and when I realized I was\
  \ the first one back I wondered if I was doing enough. I felt guilty for not watching\
  \ El better, and now for taking less time to look. I\u2019m failing her. It was\
  \ then that I prayed. The others also returned empty handed. We were at a loss for\
  \ ideas or anyone to help. We had spent all night easily finding her sitting outside\
  \ alone or in a corner but at 4am we thought the best way to handle the situation\
  \ was to now let our hostel alert the police. Deflated, we walked away.\n\nTen minutes\
  \ into our walk back Justine got a message from Elly asking us to be quiet when\
  \ we came in because she was heading to bed. She\u2019d staggered back to the room\
  \ thinking we were behind her and just kept going. We shared a sigh of angered relief\
  \ that turned into a burst of energy. \n\nNearing home, we managed to take one photo\
  \ of the Ha\u2019Penny before Justine\u2019s phone died. That photo is symbolic\
  \ not only of the tribe I never expected to find, but the lengths at which we had\
  \ all gone for our newfound friendship. I had it framed."
