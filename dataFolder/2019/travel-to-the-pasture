Text: "I was born in a family affiliated with agriculture, herding livestock and observed\
  \ my parent enjoying their lives in the wakhi traditional style. In a few year of\
  \ my childhood the modern lifestyle took away this lifestyle of my family and even\
  \ vanished from my village. I was much more involved in my new lifestyle different\
  \ from my parents and my childhood. After long time I got an opportunity to visit\
  \ Batura pasture one of the tourist attraction location in Hunza Pakistan.  Herding\
  \ livestock is still alive in one or another way in the life of people of Hussaini.\
  \ The trail along the Batura Glacier is not too longer, tougher but not as danger\
  \ as other pasture in the area.  There are two tracks to reach Batura. I followed\
  \ the trail of Sekr Wush e Zdur starts from Karakoram Highway at Passu along the\
  \ Batura Glacier at western side.   I selected the trail because it is shorter way\
  \ to reach there and the tracks were made by the local donors with the help of volunteers.\
  \ The donors have provided only food to the volunteers for construction of these\
  \ trails. No payment is given to any one while constricting the tracks from Passu\
  \ to the end of the pastures. \n I left my village Hussaini early in the morning\
  \ and start tracking at Passu and reached at first pasture called helga.  After\
  \ two and half hours track I was in Batura consists of two summer pastures Mulungin\
  \ and Maidun. The villagers were settled in Maidun where they live for about 3 months\
  \ with their livestock in the summer. They herd thousands of ships and goats. In\
  \ the morning they take the animals for grazing after milking.   The turn of grazing\
  \ comes to each family and they are responsible for the day of their turn. They\
  \ must go with animals otherwise snow leopard and beasts hunt their animals. In\
  \ the evening they bring back the animal to the cattle-shed for milking and taking\
  \ care of them near the human settlements gathered in an area with boundary walls.\
  \ Caring of animals is duty of young people and milking is the duty of elder women.\
  \ The elder women are also responsible for producing other dairy products. They\
  \ transform milk in to yogurt and guide young women shacking yogurt in a wooden\
  \ machine called Se\u0304ghu to separate butter from the lassi. The elder women\
  \ continually check the process till it is ready to separate butter from the dhig\u0304\
  h (lassi). This all process is called dhig\u0304h xhak. As butter is separated from\
  \ the lasi then the lasi is cooked almost for 8 hours to transform it into qe\u0304\
  ru\u0304t. When the liquid is condensate then it is kept on the roofs of the houses\
  \ for drying. This dried substance is called qe\u0304ru\u0304t and kept in stores\
  \ for future used. It is mixed with many Wakhi foods e.g. Molida, Dghov, Ghalme\u0304\
  ndi etc. during my journey to Batura Pasture I also enjoyed all these local and\
  \ traditional foods prepared by dairy products. \nPasture and pasturing in Hussaini\
  \ is related to a local calendar called Diqun Hisob, they adjust their living in\
  \ low lands in winter and high lands in summer. In mid of May the villagers leave\
  \ village for pastures. They start grazing from Mulungin, which is a low altitude\
  \ pasture and then move to Maidun  at about 3,300 matters high above sea level.\
  \ As autumn appear on that altitude they come back to the lower pasture to avoid\
  \ harsh weather. They have special rules for grazing of both the pastures. If they\
  \ are in Maidun they do not allow anyone to take animals to Kirgaswashk for grazing,\
  \ the same if they are in Mulungin they do not allow grazing in Maidun. This control\
  \ is mostly exercised by the oldest women in the pasture. Rest of the people in\
  \ the pasture has to be obeying the lady considering her the most experience women\
  \ in Cheqar (the pasture settlement). Free grazing is strictly prohibited in both\
  \ the pastures. The elders of the Che\u0304qar have to decide on grazing areas of\
  \ the pastures on daily bases and to monitor the grazing schedule."
