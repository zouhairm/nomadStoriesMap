Text: "The second day into the new year, I was at scenic Deori Village. Tirthan river\
  \ cut through rocky spaces, giggling in the laps of gigantic Himalayas. Our loving\
  \ hosts at the Pinterest-looking cottage recommended us - my brother, two of our\
  \ friends, and I - to go to Jalori Pass. \u201CYou must go if you are in Tirthan\u201D\
  \ \u201CJalori is where you will find snow\u201D.\n\nSo, we decided to leave for\
  \ wilderness, on a foggy afternoon. Jalori is a mountain pass, that connects two\
  \ popular districts of Himachal, Kullu and Shimla,  also a means of trading and\
  \ migration for centuries. It was roughly 30 kilometres from our cottage in Deori.\
  \ Halfway through, our car heated up. Roads were wet and steep, he advised not go\
  \ ahead. We were standing on a mountain road, contemplating ways to make it to Jalori\
  \ when I noticed snow-dust began to fall, melting as it touched the wet road.\n\n\
  Out of nowhere, we saw a car coming. Akash, a concerned local, stepped out of his\
  \ car, asked if we needed help. He said he was going Shoja, the last village before\
  \ Jalori. Looking at our faces, he offered us a ride for a reasonable charge. He\
  \ promised to drop us back at Jibhi village, where he said our car could be parked\
  \ meanwhile.\n\nWe wrapped ourselves with every warm cloth hurriedly - I piled myself\
  \ with sweaters, a thick jacket and two ponchos, a triangular woollen cloth. I slid\
  \ my freezing hands into gloves. Everyone had warned us that it gets too cold. We\
  \ hopped inside his car, thrilled at the thought of snow on our tongues.\n\nAs we\
  \ drove upwards, roads narrowed, snowflakes turned bigger, and brown bare earth\
  \ changed its hues to all white. Tall pine trees stroked white, glowing with dashes\
  \ of sunrays, that the cold air could manage to seep in.\n\nDriving forward, some\
  \ people waved, signalling us not to go any further. We were exactly 3 km away from\
  \ the peak, the milestone said. Akash followed their recommendation and asked all\
  \ of us to start hiking up.\n\nWe followed him, as I felt the snow descending like\
  \ magic. There\u2019s nothing more miraculous than a snowfall, the powerful music\
  \ created by its silence. We walked and ran, paused to click photographs, to dance\
  \ a little. I rode a long slide of a frozen waterfall. Then, picked up a beautiful\
  \ orange leaf, watched it as the only colour in the pearly backdrop.\n\nThe grey\
  \ sky grumbled. We started to walk back as the sun was slowly disappearing, and\
  \ the temperature had gone too low.\n\nOn our way back, we slipped and tripped on\
  \ the frozen ice, multiple times. At first, we laughed out loud. Slowly, the snow\
  \ started to fall faster and heavier. Hilarious turned scary \u2013 as we couldn\u2019\
  t take a single step without the fear of falling.\n\nThe last few sun rays from\
  \ the setting sun were still a hope. We managed to reach the car, and said \u201C\
  phew\u201D in relief, only to realize that what was going to follow us was a bigger\
  \ hurdle than we just passed.\n\nOur car couldn\u2019t be moved, the wheels slipped\
  \ in the black ice, without any control of steering on it. There was another car\
  \ from the plains, whose driver couldn\u2019t manage at all. Akash volunteered to\
  \ help as their vehicle was heavier. Around 8 men surrounded the car, with Akash\
  \ on the driver seat, they dragged their vehicle further down, out of my sight.\n\
  \nThere was no sign of sun anymore. Akash hadn\u2019t returned in an hour or what\
  \ felt like four. My brother was left at the car, and my friends had gone further\
  \ down. It got completely dark. The temperature dropped to minus 17, a passerby\
  \ stated. With no battery on my phone and swollen toes - I sat without a torch,\
  \ on an iced rock, I was absolutely alone.  My fingers felt like it\u2019d burst.\
  \ My face was numbed.\n\nThere are only rare times that I\u2019ve felt frightened\
  \ to a point that I am breathless and this was that. That\u2019s when I whispered\
  \ to myself \u201Cwhy are the most beautiful experiences so dangerous after all?\""
