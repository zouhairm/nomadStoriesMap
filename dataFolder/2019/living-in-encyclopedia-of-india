Text: "The thing about things in places you dont live in is that you are looking for\
  \ words to define how they felt to you. So the thing about Sikkim was that it truly\
  \ had my back. \n\nIf a place could hug and offer you a glass of whatever it is\
  \ that you like a glass of, that place would be Sikkim. Its nice old person always\
  \ wanting have people over, to entertain them and to look/ be looked after. \n\n\
  While my travel to this land was nothing but a series of stories, it is my journey\
  \ here that prepared me to see what I was in for. \n\nIRCTC, Indian Railway Catering\
  \ and Tourism Corporation, is an introduction to authentic India. A map comprehensible\
  \ only to its makers, tries to simplify an overly complicated network of railway\
  \ systems and track that connect the Himalayas in the North to the Indian Ocean\
  \ in the South and Thar desert in the West to the magical Himalayan Forests in the\
  \ East. This is the Living Encyclopedia of India, simply because you don't meet\
  \ one type of person. You meet a confusing array of extremely different people talking\
  \ in different languages all the while passing through cities, towns and village\
  \ of India. \n\nMy train from Chennai would take me to Kolkata from where I would\
  \ catch a bus to Sikkim. The journey from Chennai to Kolkata would take two days\
  \ to complete and it gave me plenty of time to finish a book I had been wanting\
  \ to read. However, on seeing a a family of four enter my compartment all thoughts\
  \ of completing my book vanished. The family consisted do of a young mother and\
  \ three little daughters. \n\nThe mother was a tactful mixture of kind and sharp.\
  \ How do I know this? While the kids were fun, funny and vivacious they were extremely\
  \ well behaved. Now, how do I know would that? I was able to complete my book. \n\
  \nI became friends with the family though. The kids did the most peculiar things\
  \ and came up with all sorts of elaborate and ridiculous entertainment for their\
  \ mother. One of them was to plate the left over food they carried with them and\
  \ garnish it with salt and sugar. Except the salt was really detergent. The other\
  \ was to make an impromptu swing from one seat to another.\n\nThe family was going\
  \ to visit their mother's parents in Sikkim. They kids were looking forward to swim\
  \ and the mother looking forward to rest. She had already started on that matter\
  \ though. It seemed like she was catching up an entire years worth of sleep because\
  \ she napped through most of the train ride. That surprised me a little. Because\
  \ in this day and age most parents are extremely vigilant when it comes to watching\
  \ over their kids. However, I soon came to know why. While the mother napped, the\
  \ children were confined to do whatever it is they wanted to do in the compartment.\
  \ They were careful not be loud and wake their mother. While she was awake, they\
  \ would parade the entirety of the railway block stopping to chat with random strangers\
  \ while the mother sat on the edge of her seat watching them. This seemed to be\
  \ carefully executed intricate routine that had takes years of practice. On the\
  \ rare occasion that the mother was not napping, she and I would have the famous\
  \ IRCTC tea. I learnt that the family cam from an extremely humble home but the\
  \ mother was a fierce feminist when it came to her daughters. Not so much for herself\
  \ though.\n\nOn the last day, the mother laid out papers on the seat (so as to not\
  \ dirty the seat during meal times, she did this for all the meals) and took out\
  \ four neatly packed boxes of food. The family ate, and just as they were winding\
  \ up, the youngest daughter flung out her neat little box and spoon out the window.\
  \ The mother visibly irritated asked her why she did that. And the little, little\
  \ kid replied ever so nonchalantly, 'the world is my cupboard Ma, the tiffin will\
  \ be back when you need it'."
