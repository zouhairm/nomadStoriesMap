Text: "It\u2019s midnight. The cold breeze tweaks my uncovered cheeks. There is no\
  \ sign of life at the train station, except for one mother and her two children.\
  \ They seem so vulnerable, but so calm. \u201CWhat it is that you do here, on the\
  \ edge of the rails of such a small city?\u201D. Then, my odd accent causes the\
  \ delay of the train to go unnoticed. At least for her.\nMore and more passengers\
  \ arrive. Loneliness is no longer a problem, fortunately. For some, like me, it\
  \ would be necessary to wait twenty long hours to cross from the province of Santa\
  \ Fe to Tucum\xE1n, in northern Argentina. From there, Salta and Jujuy would be\
  \ the destinations, where I hoped to find salt deserts and colorful mountains.\n\
  What is so magical about a foreigner? His language, of course, is different, as\
  \ are his physical traits. However, this seems to go well beyond. There is a mystery\
  \ that everyone seems to notice, but no one can describe what it is. A lack of shyness\
  \ helps me to become an attraction. But time\u2019s not flying for me. \nA stone.\
  \ The conductor\u2019s cabin had been shattered by a flying boulder. Two hours lost\
  \ on a frosty spring night. The only heat available comes from people. Their faces\
  \ come and go as the clouds pass in the sky. Each one of them carries a story, some\
  \ secrets, pains and passions. Is it possible to unravel them? Well, maybe for a\
  \ foreigner. After all, what is there to lose? He doesn\u2019t know anyone. The\
  \ twenty long hours, which at first would be solitary, are filled with generosity.\
  \ Besides food and drink, people share their stories as if I were an old friend.\
  \ \nHow sweet is the sleep of weariness\u2026 whatever position, it overcomes all\
  \ setbacks. The monotonous landscape of the sunlit plain is overcome by an unexpected\
  \ scenery in one of the train cars: it was full of boy scouts. I took part in that\
  \ movement for the seven years of my adolescence. That people reminded me of colors,\
  \ smells and faces. More stories and company for the long day we were going to face.\n\
  Coincidences exist. At least that\u2019s what we think. During the clich\xE9 dialogue\
  \ of asking \u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D and \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\
  , I met people from the same place I came from. The world is not small. In fact,\
  \ it is we who have the incredible gift of moving. You know what? Everyone wants\
  \ to know the best destinations, but few realize that the greatest wealth is on\
  \ the way. \nThe noise of the brake signals the end of the journey, which is actually\
  \ just the beginning. Who would have thought? Twenty hours on a train would cause\
  \ nostalgia. So is life on the road, or rather on rails. Once in a while, the smiles\
  \ of people can attract more than the colors of a landscape."
