Text: "It was a bright sunny morning, I woke up to birds chriping and the alarm ringing.\
  \ Today, It was the start of the Norwegian experience! I was living in the heart\
  \ of Bergen, it was a small city yet so rich in culture and heritage. Situated along\
  \ the edge of Norway, it is a trading port.\n\nMy stomach growled from hunger. Time\
  \ for the first Norwegian breakfast! I have heard that it is well-known for their\
  \ vast seafood spread. I headed straight for a seafood experience at the Bergen\u2019\
  s fish market! There are many different stalls set up in the same area, most of\
  \ them selling almost similar products but yet at different prices. I made a quick\
  \ tour around the fish market. There are many fresh seafood, both alive and dead\
  \ within an hour. Crabs, scallops, oysters, prawns, etc. Oh my, I was blessed with\
  \ so many options to choose! But sadly, I have a budget to stick with during this\
  \ trip. I couldn\u2019t make up my mind to what I should eat, I am a sucker for\
  \ seafood. I would choose seafood over red meat. So I asked for recommendations\
  \ from the staffs of one of the stalls in the fish market. They recommended me to\
  \ pick any seafood that I would like to have and they will top it off with some\
  \ salad. The staff also note that Norwegian are famous for their salmon, and it\
  \ seemed like they are proud of it and they took a lot of pride in preparing them!\
  \ I finally came to a decision to have two oysters, one big huge juicy scallop and\
  \ a nice amount of Norwegian salmon. I was so excited, and yes I\u2019m already\
  \ starving! \n\nI was brought to a table outside of the fish market. I wanted to\
  \ enjoy the view of the many little boats, ships and the beautiful city of Bergen.\
  \ When I always travel, I will always take the opportunity to connect with people\
  \ and nature. It was 7 degrees of winter, the smell of fish and salty ocean . So\
  \ foreign yet comforting and sat comfortably on my chair and waiting patiently for\
  \ my food to be prepared. Soon a waitress came with my freshly prepared food! I\
  \ was so excited to dig in, took a quick Instagram snap to capture this amazing\
  \ piece of art! Started off with the oysters, and I was taken off guard by how fresh\
  \ it was! Exactly what I was looking for in seafood, the taste of the ocean. The\
  \ scallop was as big as my palm of my hand. Ok probably a little bit bigger. To\
  \ be honest, it was the biggest, juicy and fatty scallop I have ever eaten in my\
  \ life! The salmon was grilled to perfection, Not too soft or hard, it has a very\
  \ tender yet juicy texture. It isn\u2019t any kind of grilled salmon that I would\
  \ eat back home. The salad was amazingly fresh and so crunchy. I love salad that\
  \ have a grassy smell and crunchy. It makes salad eating so much fun and interesting!\
  \ I ordered a glass of Norweigian mineral water from the mountain. I was told that\
  \ Norweigian tap water is very safe to drink as their water comes from the mountains\
  \ that they have. They don\u2019t know how blessed they are, I sip a little bit\
  \ of the ice cold mineral water and it became the most fresh and quenching water\
  \ that I have ever tasted and drank. After the amazing and sumptuous meal. I sat\
  \ back at my seat and enjoy the fresh morning air in bergen. I was actually very\
  \ cold but yet everything seemed so comforting, It was nothing that I have experience.\
  \ Everyone was walking pass by enjoying the view. I closed my eyes and slowly took\
  \ a deep breath while emerging myself in this little happy city."
