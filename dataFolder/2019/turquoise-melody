Text: "Who would have known that a random plan could have ended up being an experience!\
  \ My cousin Shubho had come to visit us, making time from his busy schedule. I quit\
  \ my job in the big bad capital city in order to figure out what life wanted from\
  \ me, and so here I was asking serious questions and rethinking about making strategic\
  \ plans. \n\nShubho had come to my sleepy little town, Shillong, on a three day\
  \ tour for some work related purpose and had a day off. He confided how he had heard\
  \ about the Krang Shuri Falls and wanted to check it out. I was in. I needed a fresh\
  \ perspective. After managing to persuade my father and uncle, off we went the very\
  \ next day.\n\nThis place was located in Jowai in the West Jaintia Hills, a few\
  \ hours drive from Shillong. We started at around 8 in the morning. Soon the urban\
  \ landscape faded from our view. All around us were vast fields, winding roads,\
  \ and small shops. The rural way of life- children playing with marbles and sticks,\
  \ elders chatting on the steps of their shops, a farmer smoking a cigarette- made\
  \ me smile. I imagined myself in a movie. This felt just like that. We stopped for\
  \ tea and some light snacks, inquiring about the waterfall and how to get there.\
  \ The locals spoke in broken English and so it was decided that we would ask people\
  \ on the way, should we need direction. We did and Shubho was at his hilarious best\
  \ while trying to communicate with a group of young children who were returning\
  \ from school. \n\nSoon we reached the place. As it turned out, we had to walk for\
  \ sometime to reach the Falls. The steps were steep in some places and we carefully\
  \ went down. One could hear the sound of water. Once we got there, a majestic view\
  \ revealed itself. The water was a deep turquoise blue. On its left was a partial\
  \ cave where people could sit and chat, click selfies with the waterfall in the\
  \ background, or just get a better view. Some teenagers were swimming and hooting\
  \ as a way to express joy. I found a cozy corner and a medium sized boulder was\
  \ just that. \n\nAs the other tourists were leaving, silence descended like a welcome\
  \ change. The sound of the Fall was soothing. I had seen the other waterfalls in\
  \ my town, but this felt different. Imagine being on a raft in the middle of a calm\
  \ ocean; this was that. The birds chirped and the sun was at its warmest. I loved\
  \ this feeling of being engulfed by stillness. Several minutes passed, and soon\
  \ we were on our way up. \n\nClimbing down is a riot, but climbing up is always\
  \ about counting your breath. Tried counting the steps and forgot about it. Once\
  \ we reached our car, we decided to have lunch. A small food joint was nearby, run\
  \ by a local Jaintia family. The food was simple yet delicious- rice, lentil soup,\
  \ mixed vegetables and chicken curry. This was perfection at its best; a laid back\
  \ energy to the day. The woman who ran this place had a daughter who was somewhere\
  \ between 8-9 months. I will never forget her face. I carried her around and she\
  \ seemed to like me. All of us laughed when she refused to go back to her mother's\
  \ lap. \n\nDay gave way to dusk and soon we were on our way back to Shillong. Slow\
  \ music accompanied the gradual darkening of the sky. And with every turn of the\
  \ road, I felt at peace with myself. After a long time, it was this unexpected peace\
  \ which filled me. And then, it rained."
