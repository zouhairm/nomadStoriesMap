Text: "After five days in Bangkok, I planned to swap Bangkok\u2019s concrete jungle\
  \ with a real jungle and hopefully spot some wildlife in Khao Yai National Park..\
  \ This was to be my first jungle trek.\n\n Since this is a large park, I hired a\
  \ park ranger with his own vehicle. I stressed that I wanted to avoid the trails\
  \ where lots of tourists trod. Therefore, we proceeded up a trail into the jungle\
  \ away from the gathering tourist groups. \n\nIt was quite cool inside the canopy\
  \ of trees. The sky could barely be seen through the very tall trees. Soon, the\
  \ sound of cars faded as we made our way deep into the jungle. As time went by I\
  \ noticed that the jungle was strangely quiet. When I pointed this out, the ranger\
  \ remarked that the wildlife may have been disturbed by vehicles and people. In\
  \ a humorous tone I remarked that the animals may have gone away on holiday, being\
  \ 31st December, a public holiday. Still I had not yet lost hope of spotting at\
  \ least one animal. \nTo his credit, the ranger was all the time on the lookout\
  \ for any visible animal. All of a sudden he put up his right hand palm to stop\
  \ me ,and placed a finger to his ear, signalling me to listen. At first I couldn't\
  \ hear anything but then I started to discern a tock-tock...tock-tock rhythm. The\
  \ ranger then pointed upwards to a nearby tree and there I saw a bird tapping with\
  \ his beak onto the trunk. 'It's a woodpecker' cried the ranger. 'Look, there are\
  \ two others further up the tree!'\n\nAfter admiring the woodpecker we continued\
  \ on our trek. Shortly after, we heard a cry coming from high up in the trees. The\
  \ ranger said that it was a bird called hornbill, showing me a photo from his guidebook.\
  \ \u2018It eats fruit, insects and small animals\u2019. The cry followed us for\
  \ some time but we never saw the bird.\n\nA short while after we stumbled upon an\
  \ elephant footprint and a flattened area of shrub and vegetation next to a small\
  \ water puddle. \u2018Look, an elephant was here and stopped to drink' remarked\
  \ the ranger. Soon after, we spotted another elephant footprint. The prospect of\
  \ meeting with a wild elephant filled me with a mix of excitement and fear. Especially\
  \ if it happened to be a male elephant as these are aggressive. In addition an elephant\
  \ can run up to 25km per hour, so escape is ruled out. However no elephant showed\
  \ up. \nWe continued on our trek, negotiating the tree roots meandering across the\
  \ rough paths. Every now and then we came across a large Banyan tree with its giant\
  \ roots. These trees are described as a 'restaurant' for the jungle wildlife, a\
  \ source of food for many animals. Still, no sign of other wildlife except for claw\
  \ scratches on the barks of some trees and a small hole 1 inch in diameter, in a\
  \ tree trunk. These happened to be Asian Black Bear claw marks as it made its way\
  \ up to a beehive and a tarantula spider hole respectively. All of a sudden the\
  \ ranger pointed upwards towards a nearby tree. 'Look up in that tree, at the top.'\
  \ Can you see a big black shape with a long tail?\u2019 'Where ?' I asked. 'Up there,\
  \ follow my finger' replied the ranger in an excited tone. Finally I managed to\
  \ spot a big black shape but could not discern what I was seeing. 'Is it an Asian\
  \ Black Bear?'  'No, it is a Giant Black Squirrel' explained the ranger, getting\
  \ out an illustrated wildlife booklet out of his jacket and showing me the description\
  \ of the animal. Well, it was so high up in the tree that it was not possible to\
  \ view in detail. Soon after we excited the jungle and headed for the Visitors\u2019\
  \ Centre.  \n\n\u2018Go to the river bank. There is a deer\u2019 , shouted the ranger.\
  \ I immediately rushed to the spot. After waiting patiently for other eager photographers\
  \ to make space,  I got a close up shot with the deer in the background. My wildlife\
  \ spotting adventure was now a success."
