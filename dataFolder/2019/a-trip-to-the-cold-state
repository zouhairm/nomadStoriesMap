Text: "It always amaze me to travel and when traveling to somewhere unknown is what\
  \ gives me thrill a passion to travel more. I have visited many places like andaman\
  \ my birth place, then goa, Maharashtra and many more. It always thrilled me what\
  \ it would be like to travel north and what it will feel to touch the snow, how\
  \ the people live in that cold? Well all that were answered when we traveled there.\
  \ \n\n   It was really cold there and places like kullu and manali are the places\
  \ were you will want to live the rest of your life. When i opened my window curtains\
  \ of my hotel room all i can see was a big mountain with a snow blanket on it and\
  \ it's really unexplainable that feeling you get when you see something or leap\
  \ into the unknown. There was places that gave me inner peace, those temple and\
  \ the little monks running here and there, loved to play cricket with them too.\
  \ The people there were very helpful, they feed us also with there special food.\
  \ There clothes were very colorful and thick to protect them from that temperature\
  \ but they were living there for many years so they told us that this cold is nothing\
  \ compared to the real ones and on the other side we were dying in that 2\xB0C cold.\
  \ We traveled to many places like the bike trip to leh ladakh, brighu mountain,\
  \ eat and drinked their special wine known as \"Lugadi.\" The people there were\
  \ always smiling having a good time without any tension and main thing there was\
  \ very less pollution. The air was very clean and healthy. They said that \"the\
  \ people who live in the villages or mountains live more years than those who live\
  \ in the city\" and that's a truth. I never wanted to leave that area, that sight,\
  \ those people but a traveler needs to move on and that's what i did. A leap into\
  \ the unknown, i will never forget that place and thinking about to soon visit again."
