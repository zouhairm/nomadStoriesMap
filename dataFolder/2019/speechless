Text: "I dropped my suitcase off at Georgie's house before I hailed a cab for the\
  \ station.  \nShe wanted to walk me but I wouldn't let her.  I wish I had had the\
  \ courage to read her the poem I had written her but I figured I could read it to\
  \ her when I came back for my suitcase and said goodbye for good. \nThe bus to Aqaba\
  \ sounded on the loudspeaker in Arabic and I read the script flash across the screen\
  \ from right to left.  I didn't know why I had chosen to go to Egypt on my own.\
  \  I couldn't explain to my parent\u2019s just months before why Jordan but   my\
  \ parents got used to accepting it when saw they had no say.  They urged me to consider\
  \ the circumstances and then reluctantly supported my decisions, but I knew why.\
  \  Nobody knew about the Middle East like I did.  Even my Uncle, who was a civilian\
  \ contractor for the Air Force and had spent time in Afghanistan and Iraq told me\
  \ to \"watch out for bombs.\"  I didn't expect something like that from him, and\
  \ honestly I hardly expected anything before I left.  \nFour months traveling and\
  \ learning Arabic in Amman had taught me a lot. I saw the conflicts in Palestine,\
  \ the barriers and the bullet holes, and the place where Jesus was born.  I saw\
  \ empty streets on Friday mornings and protests echoing in the alleys that same\
  \ night.  I didn\u2019t know what to believe and yet I my experiences took me from\
  \ dark nights into fresh mornings, where the man on the corner would be waiting\
  \ for me with a falafel sandwich.  \nMy host family taught me about how to stay\
  \ warm in winter with one space heater, And that sacrifice meant more than going\
  \ without a good beer for four months.  They\u2019d give up a bed and a room to\
  \ teach their kids English and live in a better part of the city.  I felt like a\
  \ prince in their home, but so was every guest I saw walk through their front door.\
  \  \nWe sat cross legged on the ground and smoked Houkas in the afternoons, making\
  \ life and love with strangers and discussing our own solutions to the conflicts\
  \ we saw.  The stray dogs followed us home, and the cats seemed to hover on building\
  \ edges looking over us.  Trash burned on city corners and the flames licked up\
  \ the edges of their containers to second floor heights.  I glanced around me and\
  \ nobody seemed to notice.  \u201C3eaddi Y3eanni 3eadii\u201D my friends would joke\
  \ with a nod and wave of the hand, \u201Cnormal, normal,\u201D and we\u2019d shrug\
  \ it off.  \nI looked out the window of the one-roomed station as the bus pulled\
  \ up and everyone shuffled towards the entrance.  I put my headphones in and let\
  \ the music ring in my ears.  It calmed me when I felt most anxious and alone and\
  \ I had listened to it often on my long walks home.\n\nIt felt as though I was leaving\
  \ a place I had made my home.  I was taking a step into the unknown.  Nobody I knew\
  \ had ever been to Egypt. The News pleaded of unrest and car bombings, of violence\
  \ and terror tactics at checkpoints and borders and I knew it couldn\u2019t be the\
  \ full story.  I had to see it for myself.  \nI boarded the bus and let my backpack\
  \ fall into the empty seat next to me.  I looked out the window as the bus dodged\
  \ traffic towards the city limits. \nI felt a tapping on my shoulder and turned.\
  \  The man smiled at me, I smiled back.  He mouthed words but nothing came out,\
  \ so I responded, asking his name in Arabic. He pointed towards his ears and motioned\
  \ quickly with his hands and eventually at the notebook and pen in my lap.  I translated\
  \ the script, reading out Iraq and he smiled with a thumbs up.  We talked and he\
  \ pointed at my phone saying, Kameera! \nHe put his arm around me and we smiled\
  \ at the lens.  Captured forever, Iraq and I, in Jordan, on the way to Egypt and\
  \ into the unknown together."
