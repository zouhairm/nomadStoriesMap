Text: "Travelling to new place is no big deal in my opinion, the gaga is what i want\
  \ from this holiday? Fulfilling the annual family check list or upgrading my social\
  \ media status by saying \"much needed break\" or simply and selfishly satisfying\
  \ my very own solidarity?  Till a year ago my travel zeal used to be a mix of the\
  \ first two, however, be it the so called middle age crisis or finally understanding\
  \ my heart crying for 'i need a break from everything', I finally nodded to the\
  \ idea of travelling alone. \n\nI wanted to travel slightly far away from my native\
  \ land and see in person how more exotic the oceans in abroad may look like, and\
  \ of course considering my wallet on a primary basis, I chose Bali in Indonesia.\
  \  As per my understanding, 7 out of 10 Indian International traveler has definitely\
  \ been to Bali and they only consider Kuta to be inhabited by humans and for sure\
  \ the place is nothing but only the cradle of jiggling lights, loud musics and jumping\
  \ jacks all night. \n\nOn a contrary to brag about my holiday in Bali and to tell\
  \ people arrogantly that ' you have to know where to go in Bali'; I wanted some\
  \ different choices, and luckily i found some options, lot more than i expected\
  \ and whats more they seemed so much unusual. Sanur was the first stop of a week's\
  \ holiday. A partially quiet town, with no sign of loud music but a toothsome number\
  \ of foodies' caverns, and long paved walkaways along the fawn sandy beach. While\
  \ the sunny afternoons are apt for slow, long beach walks and resting on the shacks\
  \ for coffee in between and loving the light-dark sky blue water, evenings are all\
  \ about gorging. Be it at the rolling stalls of the night market, who sells all\
  \ possible Indonesian street foods or the multi-cuisine fine dining restaurants\
  \ by the glossy road, everything is heartilicious. \n\nVisiting the neighboring\
  \ towns made me realize that I could lose lots of my charity calories very easily\
  \ while in Bali. Trekking in Ubud rice terrace for example, looks like numerous\
  \ grassy rectangle blocks are arranged one after the other inside a crater and an\
  \ hour's of climbing down those tall steps like Godzilla then crawling up like a\
  \ bear is quite a kicking-the-muscles. I also shouldn't forget to mention that i\
  \ had shared this day trip with an elderly Belgian couple close to my parents' age,\
  \ and to my amazement they were rib-punchingly funny. While this was neither planned\
  \ nor expected, even guffawing at their purposely witty pranks was crazy and unexpected.\
  \ \n\nI had cautiously skipped the commonly visited places by tourists to avoid\
  \ the flock of heads all around which wasn't a bad decision as at Uluwatu temple\
  \ I faced the same, herd of pretty faces swarming all over. But then the view of\
  \ the crystal salt water up from the cliff was startling, and gazing at the sun\
  \ setting under the ocean was like falling in love again. \n\nI was quite happy\
  \ with my first selection, and was more excited about the next. Candidasa it was,\
  \ a small village in Amlapura, east of Bali. I had to check my heart beat to realize\
  \ the originality of this place. A quiet village embracing tourists with all required\
  \ facilities, and enriched in their traditional cultural values. The ocean here\
  \ is like, chilled Blue lagoon is overflowing from the giant margarita bowl.  The\
  \ Sparkling and slightly nudging water is perfectly addictive for snorkeling or\
  \ swimming. Also there are the vintage temples, palaces; soothing foamy waterfalls\
  \ across the villages. This small island in Indonesia is filled with surprises.\
  \ \n\nThen there are the Balinese people, as happy as home and helpful like the\
  \ neighbours and seeing so many Westerners settled here speaks it all. Bali is beguiling\
  \ in every aspect. The Sapphire blue sea water, lincoln green nature, shimmery daytime\
  \ and cool evenings; Bali is all these. Even the scenic smooth drives along the\
  \ shore cannot be a miss. Life is cuddly when holidaying in Bali and holiday in\
  \ Bali has been satisfactorily finding myself at last and vowing to never stop solo\
  \ travelling here after.."
