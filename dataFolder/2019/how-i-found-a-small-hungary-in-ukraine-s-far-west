Text: "BEREHOVE \u2013 Imagine a land of beautiful mountains, flowers, rivers and\
  \ caves. A land where brightly colored pheasants scamper across the fields, and\
  \ vineyards grow lush under the sun.\n\nFor a living, the locals make red and white\
  \ wine, as well as dozens of types of organic cheese.\n\nThis land is in the far\
  \ west of Ukraine\u2019s Zakarpattya Oblast \u2013 in Berehivskiy District, some\
  \ 800 kilometers to the south-east of Kyiv, and only about 10 kilometers from the\
  \ border with Hungary.\n\nThese territories used to be part of Hungary before the\
  \ World War I. Then they were Czechoslovak, Ukrainian, and then Hungarian again.\
  \ Zakarpattya finally became part of Ukraine only 72 years ago, in 1946, when Ukraine\
  \ was part of the Soviet Union.\n\nLocals say anyone who was born at the beginning\
  \ of the 20th century in Zakarpattya could have lived in five different states without\
  \ setting foot outside the area.\n\nBut a part of Zakarpattya \u2013 several districts\
  \ near the Tysa River, mostly inhabited by ethnic Hungarians \u2013 has managed\
  \ to maintain its Hungarian culture, language, and traditions.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian\
  \ Empire architecture of the cities and towns of Berehivskiy district is mixed with\
  \ cozy traditional houses with tiled roofs in the countryside.\n\nThe best time\
  \ to come here is in April and May to enjoy cherry trees, lilac, daffodils, wisteria\
  \ and many other flowers that bloom in spring.\n\nBeregszasz\n\nIs it Berehove or\
  \ Beregszasz, Ukraine or Hungary? The street and road signs here are written both\
  \ in Hungarian and Ukrainian.\n\nThe Hungarian language can also be heard everywhere\
  \ in the streets. Berehove and the nearby villages of Berehivsky District are home\
  \ to some 100,000 ethnic Hungarians, who constitute 10 percent of Zakarpattya\u2019\
  s population of 1 million.\n\nOne of the options to stay in Berehove is the Zolota\
  \ Pava or Golden Peacock Hotel, located at 1 Ferenc Racoczi Square, in the city\
  \ center.\n\nOriginally a casino, constructed in 1913 when the Austro-Hungarian\
  \ Empire ruled these lands, the building was turned into a restaurant during the\
  \ Soviet times, and then into a hotel in 2003.\n\nThe building looks like a haunted\
  \ house from a movie by U.S. filmmakers Guillermo Del Toro or Tim Burton: The dark-purple\
  \ hall and blue restaurant features giant reproductions Alfons Mucha\u2019s muses\
  \ on its ceiling and walls.\n\nThe shady corridors with red carpets and yellow walls,\
  \ lined with paintings of the old towns of European capitals, lead to suites with\
  \ wooden furniture, large bathrooms, free Wi-Fi and air conditioners.\n\nA semi-lux\
  \ suite with a skylight and an extra sofa costs Hr 600 or $22 per night. Breakfast\
  \ is not included, but the Zolota Pava Restaurant, located on the first floor of\
  \ the hotel, offers plenty of dishes from Hungarian, Ukrainian and Zakarpattya cuisine,\
  \ and the average price per dish is Hr 150-290.\n\nBerehove is an ideal base from\
  \ which to travel all around the area\u2019s Hungarian villages, vineyards and mountains.\n\
  \nWine country\n\nThe small, picturesque villages of Muzhiyevo and Bene, inhabited\
  \ by ethnic Hungarians, are located some 8 kilometers east of Berehove. One can\
  \ get there by car, or by a local bus for Hr 16.\nIn the past, Muzhiyevo was the\
  \ gold mining center of the region, with a gold mine operating here until 2010,\
  \ when it was finally declared bankrupt.\n\nNowadays, the main business here is\
  \ winemaking.\n\nTwo major Ukrainian wineries, Cotnar and Chizay, are located in\
  \ Muzhiyevo.\n\nChizay\u2019s main office is located in Berehove, but the company\
  \ offers wine tours to Mala Mountain, near Muzhiyevo. Mala Mountain is completely\
  \ covered by Chizay\u2019s vineyard.\n\nFor Hr 360, or $13, the company offers a\
  \ three-and-a-half-hour tour, which includes a walk and a guided tour of the vineyard,\
  \ a wine tasting, and a bowl of the Hungarian soup Bograch for dinner.\nCotnar Winery\
  \ also offers a tour and tasting in a wine cellar in Muzhiyevo for Hr 300 or $11.\n\
  \nVisitors can see the winemaking process and then sample nine types of wine \u2013\
  \ red, white and rose \u2013 along with local cheese, fruit, and bread. However,\
  \ wine is made in the region not only by major producers: Lots of the locals also\
  \ produce homemade wine, and have been doing so for a long time.\n\nThe Ursta Family\
  \ winery, for instance, with its four-hectare vineyard in the village of Bene is\
  \ one small local winemaker, which has been in the Ursta family since the 1930s.\n\
  \nOnce bottled, the Urstas\u2019 wine is matured in the winery\u2019s cellars, located\
  \ 5-25 meters underground in the 400-year-old caves carved into the Kerteys Mountain.\n\
  \nThe winery is located at the foot of the mountain. After a wine tasting, visitors\
  \ can buy a bottle of Merlot, cold and wet from the cellars, and without even a\
  \ label. There is no need to pre-book a tour to visit Ursta Family Winery \u2013\
  \ tired tourists can just drop in: It is against local traditions to turn visitors\
  \ away.\n\nHow to get there:\n\nTo get to Hungarian Ukraine from Kyiv, take the\
  \ Kyiv-Solotvyno train for Hr 380 or $14 with a ticket on to Berehove railway station.\
  \ The journey is a long one, at 18 hours, but the train is comfortable.\n\nIf traveling\
  \ by car, take the E-40 and then E-471 highways west from Kyiv to Mukachevo, then\
  \ drive south by the M-24 and M-25 roads, or the M40, to get to Berehove. The 804-kilometer\
  \ drive should take about 10 hours.\n\nTo order a wine tour to Mala Mountain with\
  \ an English guide call +38067 322 9910.\n\nTo order a tour to Cotnar Winery, call:\
