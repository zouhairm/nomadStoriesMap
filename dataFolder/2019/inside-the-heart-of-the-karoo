Text: "We made our way through the Karoo \u2013 a vast semi desert natural region\
  \ stretching across three provinces in South Africa. The sun was coming down hard,\
  \ we could see it in kilometre upon kilometre of dry earth, beige fynbos and shimmery\
  \ fire glistening on the road\u2019s surface. All around us, as far as the eye could\
  \ see and farther still stretched more dry earth and beige fynbos, interrupted intermittently\
  \ by mounds of earth, rock and oases of defiant greenery surrounding windmills and\
  \ clinging to gullies through which the rivers flowed when the rains took mercy.\
  \ \nWe turned left off the National Route 12 heading West towards the heart of the\
  \ Karoo, our home for the night and one of the many small towns in the Northern\
  \ Cape: a hot, dry and sparsely populated province. \nVictoria West stood in a valley\
  \ 276 km from Orania, one of several white only separatist settlements, and 596\
  \ km from Cape Town, our destination. It is held in the bosom of two mountains,\
  \ its name on stone in the far distance. The town has a unique albeit old charm.\
  \ \nWe got our keys from our host and slumped onto the single beds with relief and\
  \ excitement, anxious to explore the town. The reading material in the room, first\
  \ in Afrikaans then English tells a story of the founders, of trees which have survived\
  \ the unforgiving heat for over a hundred years and the Dutch Reformed church -\
  \ its bell now tolling, built to bring together and bear witness to the spiritual\
  \ leanings of the new inhabitants, close to two centuries ago.\nAs we get ready\
  \ to explore and later get a bite to eat, I ask our host about the crime, if any,\
  \ in the area. She is good-naturedly dismissive. The only serious crime they had\
  \ was two years ago, when some youngsters visiting from Cape Town broke into a shop\
  \ in the early morning of their last day. They were caught however, and balance\
  \ quickly restored to the quaint town. We had nothing to worry about and so with\
  \ our minds at ease, we put our hats on and took a leisurely stroll. \nThe town\
  \ was silent save for a car or three on the road. We joked about westerns and scared\
  \ ourselves with tales of ghosts. The church bell went off again and our daughter\
  \ jumped, she couldn\u2019t wait to leave. We finally came along an open shop playing\
  \ Christmas music, a woman watched us with curious boredom from the counter. We\
  \ often wonder what people make of us in the small towns we pass - a lesbian multiracial\
  \ couple and their child. We left the shop with a bottle of tomato jam and headed\
  \ back to the one conspicuously open hotel on the main road. It was a buffet with\
  \ four items on the menu for the night, one of which was the Karoo lamb the area\
  \ is famous for.\nBefore we left, I asked our waitress (a coloured woman) how safe\
  \ the town was expecting a similar answer to what I had received from our hostess,\
  \ but her response was the stark opposite. She told us of rape, a murder and gang\
  \ activity on the coloured side of town. The quietness is mostly on the white side,\
  \ she said.\nWe left the hotel uneasy. The extreme polar realities are present throughout\
  \ the country but more so in smaller towns where the past hangs like a cloud over\
  \ the present. We were very eager to leave in the morning, to escape this painful\
  \ reminder of the hostile history of this beautiful country we call home."
