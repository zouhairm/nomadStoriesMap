Text: "At the end of the September Hamburg reminded me of hometown in the piedmonts\
  \ of North Caucasus. During the daytime, it was like an Indian summer with people\
  \ wearing only t-shirts. At the evening my open heels and pleated skirt were still\
  \ a reminder of the warm weather, but the hand-me-down jacket was a real-life clash\
  \ back. \n\nI played hide and seek with the rain under the canopy of the bar Frau\
  \ M\xFCller. At this bar, my friend Anna and I spent three evenings in a row watching\
  \ Bundesliga games, drinking  Aperol Spritz, meeting amazing people and living as\
  \ if we were locals.\n\nOne day we walked kilometers around the city. Even though\
  \ we didn't have much time for exploring we were searching for Hamburg vibe. Anna\
  \ tried to visit all Protestant cathedrals in the city while I was diving into casual\
  \ city life.  During the night, we went to the city\u2019s harbor and listened to\
  \ the waves. During the day we were running through the crowds at Hamburg Central\
  \ station trying to make it to the metro. \n\nOn that long walk, one thing amazed\
  \ me. It was the Church of St. Nicholas. A masterpiece of Gothic Revival left unrecovered\
  \ after the bombing on Hamburg in 1943. I\u2019ve never heard about this church\
  \ before and was shocked to see it in the center of the city. I sighed with amazement.\
  \ Lena \u2014 my friend whose family moved to Germany in the mid-90th \u2014 asked,\
  \ hear me gasping:\n- Do you know about the bombing of Dresden? \n- I read about\
  \ it in Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 5.\n- Hamburg suffered a little less. \n\nBroken\
  \ facade of a light stone was all covered under the layer of black soot. It looked\
  \ like scars. Inside of it \u2014 frighteningly calm emptiness, blown by all winds\
  \ due to the absence of the walls. Only the front part of the Cathedral and the\
  \ altar survived. On the left there was the statue of crying person with the caption:\
  \ \"No man in the whole world can change the truth. One can only look for the truth,\
  \ find it and serve it. The truth is in all places\".\n\nReaching the port of Hamburg\
  \ we were exhausted and only dreamed about a diner. But what a moment that was.\
  \ While the wind was scattering our hairs, dozens of boats were floating in the\
  \ water. And Elbphilharmonie looked as if it was a palace from the depths of Atlantis\
  \ and the windows of it were reflecting the glow of the sunset.\n\nRemember I mentioned\
  \ Central station? We came here straight from the airport. \"Although it is not\
  \ the most tourist area, it is very good here. Just don\u2019t go through Hansaplatz\
  \ at night\",  \u2014 same old Lena told us and rushed forward to understand what\
  \ guys migrants were so loudly quarreling. \n\nAnna and I saw Hansaplatz on our\
  \ second night in the city. She was taking photos of the column in the center of\
  \ the square. While our new fellow \u2014 one of the two brothers we met a few hours\
  \ ago \u2014 almost left in an unknown direction with a very impressive lady. We\
  \ noticed them when the guy opened his wallet to give the lady all the love he had.\n\
  \nOn the last morning, I went back to Hamburg Central station again. It was the\
  \ only place I could get coffee at 5 a.m. We had to check out from the hotel was\
  \ at 8. My night was full of acquaintances and fun, buy my suitcase was lying empty\
  \ in the middle of the room. I remembered my mother, who\u2019s packing routine\
  \ usually starts a few days before departure, and for the first time in my life\
  \ wanted to agree with her.\n\nSomehow we managed to get to the airport in advance.\
  \ We throw our suitcases in a long queue for registration and ran up to the second\
  \ floor. First, to drink another cup of coffee. Second, to watch as the sun's rays\
  \ fill the departure hall with light. \n\nI must confess. Germany was never my \"\
  go-to\" destination. But sitting at the airplane seat, all ready to go, I cried\
  \ as if I was leaving my home behind."
