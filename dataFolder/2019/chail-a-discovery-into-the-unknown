Text: "Pretty much every slope station in India \u2013 be it Shimla or Darjeeling\
  \ recount a similar story. Lavish and copious in summer with snow kissed conifers\
  \ covered on their slants in winters, these towns have been culled out of nature\
  \ by the British. The interesting names, a lethargic railroad station, an antiquated\
  \ church , a club and the palatial cottages are on the whole reminiscent of the\
  \ old world appeal.\n\nOn the off chance that you go for a comfortable stroll down\
  \ the shopping centers and markets of these towns, despite everything they bear\
  \ a resemblance to the provincial heritage. These slope stations were named the\
  \ late spring capitals of the Britishers who reigned over them for quite a while.\
  \ But then, one little slope station stands separated from the rest, opposing the\
  \ pilgrim headache . It owes its reality on the political and traveler maps to an\
  \ Indian ruler who made it his late spring capital. This is the tale of Chail ,\
  \ a town scarcely 45 kms from Shimla in Himachal Pradesh .\n\nSituated at a higher\
  \ height than Shimla, the story goes that the Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala\
  \ made Chail his mid year capital when the British banned him from entering Shimla.\
  \ Despite the fact that the contention was not on military grounds, the story goes\
  \ that the Maharaja was romancing a girl of Lord Kitchener, who was then the Commander\
  \ in Chief of the British armed force.\n\nThe Maharaja chose to give the British\
  \ a fitting answer and proceeded to make his own late spring capital in Chail. He\
  \ initially assembled a royal residence close Khandaghat called Chail View Palace\
  \ and after that constructed a street to Chail lastly his own late spring retreat\
  \ in this little town encompassed by deodar woods. Amusingly Chail itself had been\
  \ talented to the Maharaja by the Britishers prior .\n\nThe Maharaja was a devoted\
  \ cricketer and had captained numerous an Indian group other than playing a few\
  \ top of the line matches himself . He left Chail a trophy \u2013 a cricket ground\
  \ which has the most noteworthy ever pitch situated at 2140 meters and it bent over\
  \ as a polo ground too.\n\nIn the same way as other Indian towns , Chail has its\
  \ a lot of fantasies and legends. We visited a sanctuary devoted to a holy person,\
  \ Sidh Baba based on a hillock by the lord. Local people trust that the lord had\
  \ wanted to fabricate his castle here prior , however the diviner had visited him\
  \ in his fantasy and requesting that he pick another area.\n\nIn any case, the Maharaja\
  \ couldn't have discovered a superior spot to make his mid year capital. With the\
  \ Himalayas out of sight and the valley underneath, the waterway streaming down\
  \ and three thick hillocks secured with deodar backwoods, Chail looked each piece\
  \ an illustrious capital. The lights of Shimla and Kasauli came up as I remained\
  \ there for a short time watching the sun went down. Chail had without a doubt made\
  \ some amazing progress from an untainted village to a regal seat and now a traveler\
  \ resort ."
