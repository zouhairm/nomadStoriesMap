Text: "As I was on my flight from Toronto Pearson Airport to Sanremo, Italy as I kept\
  \ thinking to myself \"this is a mistake...\" All I wanted was to hop on the first\
  \ flight home. But I decided to stay true to my word and tutor at the ACLE camps\
  \ for one month. I would love to say that the first day I realized I made the right\
  \ the decision to travel and teach, but this was not the case. Instead, I felt even\
  \ more confused, sad and overwhelmed. I started looking at flight homes instead\
  \ of my tutoring rule book. That moment of clarity came the last day of my first\
  \ camp. It had been an exhausting two weeks of teaching, adjusting to my new host\
  \ family and student struggles. I was watching my students perform their final project,\
  \ a scene they created themselves. It was magical. I know that sounds silly but\
  \ at that moment my heart filled with joy and I wanted to freeze this moment forever.\
  \ In a flash, the scene was over and their parents applauded. \n\nI kept this moment\
  \ in my mind the whole time I travelled home. As I unpacked and returned to my life\
  \ of preparing for law school. The next thing I knew I was cancelling my application\
  \ and starting on my new path of teaching. Without that leap of faith, I do not\
  \ know where I would be except for on the wrong path."
