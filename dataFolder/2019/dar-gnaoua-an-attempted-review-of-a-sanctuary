Text: "Morocco had always been the land of my dreams; striking architecture bejewelled\
  \ against a backdrop of a seemingly arid desert. Yet here I was confounded by reality.\n\
  \nI was never going to be this person; I had watched \u2018The Amazing Race\u2019\
  \ in disgust as arrogant travellers expect everyone in the world to speak English\
  \ \u2013 yet here I was straining to remain calm as I did an awkward rendition of\
  \ the YMCA to spell out ATM to the staff at Information at an international airport\
  \ (Mohammad V \u2013 Casablanca airport). \n\nI give up and storm off; grumbling\
  \ under my breath and walk down to the train station to book my trip to Fes. I brighten\
  \ up\u2026\"This is convenient!\" Ironically, the staff (at the train ticket kiosk),\
  \ speak English beautifully. I will have to take a train to Casa Voyageur and then\
  \ take a connecting train to Fes.\nI wait for the train at a nearby caf\xE9 and\
  \ I\u2019m joined by a lovely young lady. \u2018Taken\u2019 scenarios run through\
  \ my head as she insists I join her and her family in Rabat and go to Fes the next\
  \ day. The probability that this could be a testament to the warmth and hospitality\
  \ of the people is not even considered. I continue on my 4 hour journey to Fes alone\
  \ after promising to call her the next day. I never do.\n\nFortunately, the owner\
  \ of Dar Gnaoua, Laurence advised me to take the train to Fes instead of the bus.\
  \ This advice came a week before my trip via e-mail that included clear instructions,\
  \ specifically: the confirmation of the room for the specified time period, where\
  \ the steward would await my arrival, contact numbers as well as a picture of Amhed\
  \ (the steward), who is the only person permitted to bring one to Dar Gnaona. Little\
  \ details did not escape Laurence; as she went on to describe what a petit taxi\
  \ is (a red Fiat) and the approximate fee from the train station to the meeting\
  \ point.\n\nAmhed is a kind-faced gentle mannered man. I am escorted to the B&B\
  \ down numerous alleyways; this whilst trying to acclimatize to a bombardment of\
  \ stimuli: the mannerisms of the people, the donkeys and the cobblestones.\n\nAs\
  \ soon as I arrive at Dar Gnaoua, Laurence joins Amhed and me in the foyer. I was\
  \ not expecting to feel as overwhelmed; however I am quickly put at ease as soon\
  \ as I step into this sanctuary. The B&B is an enclave of peace hidden within a\
  \ labyrinth of beautiful chaos that is the medina of Bar Rcif. \nThe interior is\
  \ distinctly Moroccan but with a sophistication that could possibly be ascribed\
  \ to its French owner. Everything from the tiling to the choice of colour can only\
  \ be described as tasteful. I would later learn that this is something I \u2018\
  need\u2019 to feel relaxed within an environment. \n\nI am given a drink upon arrival,\
  \ a map to guide my way around the medina as well as recommendations of restaurants\
  \ and sites to see whilst in Fes. A detailed itinerary or advice can be asked for\
  \ each day.  Considerations such as torches for night visits are pointed out along\
  \ with the assurance that a night attendant will wait up and collect one in the\
  \ medina if you get lost. \n\nThe single room I am shown is perfect for my needs\
  \ and includes an on-suite shower. The rest room is on the stairway adjacent to\
  \ the room. The furnishings included a bed, a chair, dresser, small chest and a\
  \ set of drawers.\n\nI ate at one of the restaurants recommended by Laurence and\
  \ had the most delicious lentil soup. I also spent much of my time on the rooftop\
  \ terrace eating breakfast and contemplating my life as I watched people; particularly\
  \ women go about their daily lives on neighbouring rooftops. \n\nAfter one particularly\
  \ late night, Amhed noted that I came in late and I am so grateful that I am at\
  \ an age that I could appreciate this as concern and not as intrusive; as I would\
  \ have done when I was younger. He truly worried about me as a solo female traveller;\
  \ and this is a rare and beautiful thing."
