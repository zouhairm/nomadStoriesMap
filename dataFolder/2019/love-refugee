Text: "It\u2019s almost embarrassing. The answer to why I left is the same as the\
  \ answer to why I returned. \n\nI was 19, serious and sun-kissed. I worked at a\
  \ backpackers\u2019 hostel on Manly beach. Entertaining foreigners was my favourite\
  \ preoccupation in the hours away from law-school. I felt that their constant awe\
  \ of my surroundings was contagious, and my wanderlust was somewhat satiated by\
  \ their adventures in my sandy backyard. Nothing like a bright-eyed traveller to\
  \ help you fall in love with your own environment again.\n\nI wore a yellow singlet\
  \ that day. Black shorts. I walked eagerly from caf\xE9 to restaurant with resumes\
  \ in hand. On the hunt for another summer job to afford the next semester\u2019\
  s worth of heavy textbooks. Philip was a waiter at a local favourite. Charming,\
  \ sickeningly handsome and radiating confidence he invited me to lunch after introducing\
  \ me to his manager. I didn\u2019t get the job, but I did join him for lunch. Five\
  \ years later, my Danish prince would take me to his cold country.    \n\nLove was\
  \ difficult in Copenhagen. Passionate, intense and difficult. My overbearing need\
  \ for surety, his whimsical confidence that life would continue to take care of\
  \ us. With my visa pending, my days were filled like those of an idle puppy. The\
  \ city too expensive to venture into, and people too busy and closed to let a stranger\
  \ in. I was so lonely. \n\nMy best friend visited as the snow began to fall. She\
  \ had an uncanny fancy for the hotdogs sold by street vendors in the town hall square.\
  \ We indulged it, and as we walked back to the car one night with her hotdog in\
  \ hand, Philip said the words that would change the course of my life \u2013 \u201C\
  your visa arrived today\u201D. The memory of those words still makes my stomach\
  \ tighten and heartbeat quicken now.\nI was on a beach in Copenhagen the following\
  \ spring when I received a phone call that built a new track on the railroad of\
  \ my life. I was offered a role well below the salary and prestige I might have\
  \ expected in Sydney. Yet I was ecstatic. I remember the HR lady\u2019s words as\
  \ though it was yesterday. She said, \u201CI can hear you smiling through the phone\u201D\
  . \n\nAs my heart embraced the new and the unexplored, it closed towards the familiar.\
  \ Our relationship ended as I walked through the company gates on one of those perfect\
  \ Danish summer\u2019s days. I found a home and a family in the walls of a company\
  \ that didn\u2019t provide long-term accommodation. I learned their language, commuted\
  \ by bicycle and became the independent woman that one becomes in Scandinavia. \n\
  \nOf course, as fate would have it, it didn\u2019t take me long to meet and fall\
  \ for the only Australian man in the company. Jason brought me into his team. He\
  \ had greater faith in me than anyone I\u2019d ever known. He empowered and inspired\
  \ me and so I fell, hard and fast and inappropriately, in love with him. Unreciprocated\
  \ love truly is a bitch. \n\nThe single most brave and stupid thing I\u2019ve ever\
  \ done is to kiss my boss after a great & boozy corporate dinner. I had flashes\
  \ of the future I was about to enter just before our lips touched \u2013 being pushed\
  \ away, getting fired, shamed by my workmates. The humiliation! When you ask him,\
  \ he was as shocked by his reaction as I was. He kissed me back and my madness was\
  \ rewarded.  \n\nIf love is easy for others, I need to start watching more carefully.\
  \ Two Australians meet in Denmark, fall in love and return to a new city in Australia.\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to come back, but I wanted him. Him a married father of one.\
  \ Me, confused. Both eager to love again and do it right.  \n\nJason asked me to\
  \ marry him on my thirtieth birthday at the top of a mountain overlooking Queenstown,\
  \ NZ. The moments are captured by our helicopter pilot who served as a cameraman\
  \ in the most spectacular moment of my life. The clouds below us, the snow beneath\
  \ us, the sunshine upon us and the future ahead of us."
