Text: "Miltenberg is a little city 45 minutes from Frankfurt am Main. I had the opportunity\
  \ of going there last year! \n This city was one of few that resisted the destruction\
  \ of  World War II, in it we can see one of the oldest restaurants. The locals are\
  \ very nice and I even found some Portuguese among the locals! It was very easy\
  \ to fit it, so easy that I never felt so good in any other place that I visited!\n\
  \ Miltenberg is as beautiful and captivating in the summer or on winter! It has\
  \ a magnificent view from the castle and you can see the Main river flowing away,\
  \ just breath taking! \n On Easter in the monastery you can see a giant Easter egg!\
  \ And if you want enjoy the view from up there, it is absolutely breathtaking! \n\
  \ German food is very different from what I usually eat as a Portuguese young woman,\
  \ but is absolutely delicious! I had the chance of being invited to a birthday party\
  \ of some of the Portuguese I met there! The variety of ways they use potatoes is\
  \ amazing may I add the flavours and textures are very different but they are very\
  \ tasty! The schnitzel and the meatballs are divine! And I\u2019ll never forget\
  \ the breakfast Bretzel, both sweet and salty! Even though I barely talk German,\
  \ it was very easy to communicate! \n Miltenberg is a very fond place in my heart,\
  \ I\u2019ll always remember it, the quietness and the ducks chasing people around\
  \ for some bread! The night lights, but most of all the amazing people that welcomed\
  \ me into their life\u2019s and still remain in contact with!"
