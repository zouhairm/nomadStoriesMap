Text: "It was my first time travel out of my country. i was afraid, exited and nervous\
  \ in same time. Never go by airplane alone and didn't have any idea what should\
  \ i do. But i did it. I live in a tropical country and visited 4 season country\
  \ is like step into another world. I arrived in Istanbul past midnight. My turkish\
  \ friend picked me up at the airport and take me to the hotel by taxi. First jurney\
  \ is Sultan Ahmed Mosque. The most beautiful mosque i ever seen. I was shocked because\
  \ no one on the street at day time. When night time come everyone come out from\
  \ their house and eat at the park like picnic. \nFew days in istanbul i went to\
  \ Ankara by bus. Another shocked approached me when i saw beautiful view fom the\
  \ bus. I felt like in a fairyland. In Ankara i stayed with my friend family because\
  \ i want to know their culture and food. living with local people was great choice.\
  \ I learned a lot of their culture and food they eat everyday. it was impressive\
  \ even though they could not speak English. Thanks to advances in technology that\
  \ make communication easier despite different languages. In Ankara i tried all the\
  \ pucblic transportastion. Car, bus, mini bus, teleferik, train and taxi. I visisted\
  \ Anitkabir and learn about their history. Turkey history. I saw how was war there,\
  \ their weapon and uniform. \nNext journey is Antalya.  Out from aitport taxi waiting\
  \ me and took me to the hotel near beach. Beautiful city with so many beautiful\
  \ beach. I also met local people there. It was easy because most of people in Antalya\
  \ can speak english really well. there also easier to find restaurant because along\
  \ the coastline there are restaurants. Two weeks in Turkey i tried all their fruit\
  \ and few of their foods. Know little about their history and culture. Most important\
  \ i got a lot of experience that i can't get in my country which makes me want to\
  \ explore this world if possible."
