Text: "To be silent - to be afraid of yourself. Therefore, I tell this story to people\
  \ I love.\nAdventure always begins with a person. \nMy love for sea originated from\
  \ my childhood: endless spaces, horror of the depths, passion for happiness, which\
  \ it brings. Caught with 100 euros in my pocket at a bus stop in Germany, I terribly\
  \ wanted to see the sea. 80 euros in exchange for a round-trip ticket. To Venice\
  \ and back. We were separated with the sea only 18 hours by bus.\nCollecting a suitcase,\
  \ sending letters to relatives, warning my boss, preparing the house for departure,\
  \ I looked for ways to walk, museums I wanted to visit, squares, bridges and shops.\
  \ I expected to find shelter there from my fears, excitement, unspent energy. I\
  \ expected to face my fears of getting lost, with the excitement of a long journey,\
  \ I was afraid to squander all that I have. Each journey is a collision between\
  \ Ying and Yang, when fears are faced with overcoming them. And I'm proud of myself.\n\
  My backpack was not full: a bottle of water, pants, jacket and documents with a\
  \ purse. When will anybody ask me: how much does a traveler need for happiness?\
  \ I will answer that not.\nThe bus was late, the nerves were at the limit, but everyone\
  \ was waiting, clutching a backpack in their hands.\nThe long-awaited bus arrived,\
  \ and the journey gained a complete and original appearance. People dozed, opened\
  \ bags of food, chatted, some of them thought about their own. The place near me\
  \ was empty for a long time, and we kept moving further and further away from the\
  \ place where it all began. A couple of calls to relatives, some obsessive thoughts,\
  \ a playlist in headphones.\nI was thinking about something remote, funny, and probably\
  \ ridiculous, when a nice, tanned guy sat down with me. As it turned out, my journey\
  \ began from exactly that moment.\nSilence tormented us for a very long time, even\
  \ growing up, we are afraid to start a conversation. But trusting people while traveling\
  \ is an important thing that cannot be overlooked. We just helped each other at\
  \ the next stop, but our acquaintance began with this.\nFor 12 hours we talked about\
  \ our countries, telling him about Kazakhstan, I dreamed of  hearing about Portugal.\
  \ He had lived in Lisbon until he moved to Germany. Reading at that moment Remarque\u2019\
  s \" Die Nacht von Lissabon\", I asked him about everything I read about. He eagerly\
  \ answered and was glad to remember his home. Went out in Milan, where his girlfriend\
  \ lived, he put a shell in my hand. He said that as a child he found it and carried\
  \ with him as a sign of the memory of the house. This little thing was his biggest\
  \ treasure for several years, but he gave it to an almost unknown girl. I asked\
  \ only why. His answer was a lesson for me: \u201CWe must return what we take, especially\
  \ from water. I want it to be with you, I will still remember the house, but you\
  \ have to promise me that your travels will not end in Venice and Germany, and you\
  \ will go much further. Be sure to visit Portugal and return to the ocean what I\
  \ took from it. \u201D He received my promise at the last minute of our farewell.\n\
  Adventure always begins with a person. Expecting to see anything, I did not expect\
  \ to find it all in another person who gave me much more than just a trip. Squeezing\
  \ in my hands a small shell from the ocean, seeing the expanses of the sea of a\
  \ completely different country, I felt a connection with everything living on the\
  \ planet. I found an adventure, first of all in my heart, and only then in another\
  \ country."
