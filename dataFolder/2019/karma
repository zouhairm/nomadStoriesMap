Text: "For sure, India is one of the craziest and most incredible countries you will\
  \ ever been. It is a country that has the most friendly people and the coolest backpackers\
  \ in the world. In the beggining you'll be crazy with the crowded cities, but if\
  \ you try to absorb the culture and feel the peace of the people, you'll also feel\
  \ that peace. And more than the peace, you will start noticing, with the simplicity\
  \ of the people, what really matters in life. \nWhen I got to Delhi, I was doing\
  \ volunteer working, and staying in a hostel with many other volunteers from all\
  \ around the world. After somedays together, we were talking about the shower at\
  \ the hostel, and a guy said that he had no towel and that he was was going to be\
  \ traveling around Asia for six more weeks. When we got back to the hostel, I went\
  \ to check my bag and realized that I had two towels but never used one of them.\
  \ Already in the Indian mode, to help the others, I just gave one to him, because\
  \ for sure he was going to use it best than I. In my point of view, people who are\
  \ traveling should always help others, because sometimes it will be you that will\
  \ need the help. And maybe in that moment when you help someone it might be nothing\
  \ to you but can mean so much to others. \nAfter few days, I went to a small town,\
  \ Rishkesh, with an American friend I made in Delhi, Natalie. The whole trip was\
  \ an adventure. First, in the train station, the train delayed two hours, and there\
  \ was almost no foreigners in there, and everyone was staring at us. Then, in the\
  \ train, we were in a wagon with many drunk men, also staring at us. We just bought\
  \ Indian food, (that we almost couldn't eat baucause it was like a soup and the\
  \ train was swinging), ate it, and stayed in our seats. We were lucky that in such\
  \ small time we became really close friends, and everything was easy cause we were\
  \ together. Afterall it all worth! We made it to one of the holy cities in the country.\
  \ The place when yoga was born, and that you can do many yoga and meditation classes.\
  \ Where you can swim in the Ganga river, and it is clean! And also meet people well\
  \ with life. In our first day, we just entered in a coffee that we found in the\
  \ street, without knowing that it was the place that many backpackers go, and spend\
  \ the evening there. There, we met a guy from United States, who introduced us to\
  \ many other friends he had in the city, and in one day we created our small Rishkesh\
  \ squad. We were supposed to stay there for a weekend, but in the end we extended\
  \ it for five days, just to watch more sunsets in the river. It is impossible to\
  \ stay just two days there if you really feel the good vibes the city has. In our\
  \ last day, we were in the same coffee, and I was writing in my travel journal at\
  \ the same time that I was trying to buy an airline ticket to go to Nepal in the\
  \ next day. But I dont know how, the airline company website was not working on\
  \ my phone. Exactly when I was complainig about the website, a guy came to me because\
  \ he saw my notebook and we started talking about writing travel jounals. After\
  \ some conversation, we became friends just because we started talking about writing.\
  \ I told him about my problem with the website and he lent me his computer for me\
  \ to buy my ticket. And in the end, he told me that he also had an notebook but\
  \ he had never written anything there because he never know what to write. So he\
  \ gave me his notebook because he said I was going to use it better than him. That\
  \ was when I realized that no matter where, as the Indians says, if you do something\
  \ nice, it comes back to you."
