Text: "I murmured a curse, in English, and fumbled through a hurried apology in Turkish.\
  \ The landlady of our airbnb stood before us, bleary-eyed and wrapped in a well-worn\
  \ pink cotton bathrobe. We had clearly just woken her up. It was 8:00 p.m. on a\
  \ Thursday. \n\n\u201CWe didn\u2019t mean to wake you!\u201D I pleaded, shooting\
  \ a glare at my friend Sarah beside me. It was she who had insisted we knock, ignoring\
  \ my ponderings that the 70-something year old woman with the hunched shoulders\
  \ and shuffling gait that owned the apartment we were renting might already be asleep.\
  \ I had only ever known my maternal grandmother, and she passed when I was very\
  \ young. Sarah still had living grandparents on both sides of her family, which\
  \ made her the expert in the nocturnal habits of the elderly, and hers stayed up\
  \ late, apparently.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s no trouble,\u201D our landlady replied in\
  \ barely-accented English. \u201CHow may I help?\u201D\n\nAll we needed to know\
  \ was where to leave our key in the morning. We were flying out of Istanbul at 6:00\
  \ a.m., onward to Goreme. With that sorted, we begged forgiveness again and began\
  \ our retreat back down the stone staircase.\n\n\u201CHave you tried Turkish coffee\
  \ yet?\u201D\n\nWe had not. We were tea drinkers.\n\n\u201CCome in, then,\u201D\
  \ our landlady commanded. She turned around and padded into her kitchen before we\
  \ could protest.\n\nThat was the thing about Istanbul (and Turkey generally). There\
  \ were so many things to love - the bloody and storied and fascinating history;\
  \ the sumptuously decorated, awe-inspiring mosques and churches; the delectable\
  \ cuisine; the bustling markets and sprawling riverside. All of that was to be expected,\
  \ really. But the people kept surprising me.\n\nAn entire bus (literally all 17\
  \ people on board) arguing good-naturedly over which stop Sarah and I should disembark\
  \ at to make it to a tiny, little known church on the outskirts of the city. The\
  \ young, local journalist who, when we asked for directions to the funicular, insisted\
  \ on walking us there himself, and ended up becoming our impromptu tour guide for\
  \ the day (not to mention surreptitiously paid for the entire bill at lunch). The\
  \ motherly woman we sat next to on the plane in and gave us a ride to our accommodation\
  \ because she didn\u2019t want us to have to wait by ourselves for the night bus.\n\
  \nAnd now our landlady. We had woken her up, and here she was, making us coffee.\n\
  \nAs we took our first few tentative sips (Turkish coffee is unfiltered and notoriously\
  \ strong), we asked her questions about herself, and her life story began to unfold.\
  \ She was from Istanbul and had lived most of her life there, except when she moved\
  \ to London by herself when she was 20. She had pursued a degree in Literature,\
  \ but her savings were slim, so she procured a four-year degree in only two and\
  \ moved back home. She married, and had four children. She spoke three languages\
  \ fluently: Turkish, English, and French. She had been a teacher. \n\nMy friend\
  \ and I had initially regarded all of these overtly friendly encounters warily,\
  \ even suspiciously. The woman who gave us a ride to our accommodation? We gave\
  \ her a fake address, two streets over, just in case. The young man who escorted\
  \ us around the city for a day? At first we tried to shake him off, convinced he\
  \ would eventually end up hitting on us, or worse. But he never did. We met up with\
  \ him when we were back in Istanbul a week later, hoping to buy him dinner in an\
  \ attempt to repay his generosity. He ended up paying for the entire meal a second\
  \ time. And in all of these scenarios (and countless others), when we questioned\
  \ why these people were being so kind to us, we were given the same simple explanation:\
  \ \u201CTurkish hospitality!\u201D\n\nThe coffee dregs sat at the bottom of the\
  \ blue and white porcelain cups, and the three of us rose to our feet.\n\n\u201C\
  Can we help you with the dishes before we leave, at least?\u201D, I asked timidly.\n\
  \nOur landlady laughed. \u201CCertainly not!\u201D"
