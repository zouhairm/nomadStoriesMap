Text: "I might not have travelled overseas yet \u2013 but trust me, travel in Indonesia,\
  \ the country which is famous for its various culture and nature, also the country\
  \ in which I was born in, has always created such a great story. Even I have been\
  \ dreaming to explore Indonesia from Sabang to Merauke. Because you can always create\
  \ different great stories from different cities. \n\nThere is one of the cities\
  \ that I just visited currently, it is Yogyakarta. The so called Student City, as\
  \ well as the City of Culture, is located in the Center of Java and has limitless\
  \ places to be visited. I guarantee you, A single day clearly won\u2019t be enough\
  \ to explore the whole city. \nOne day, as I arrived in the city with my friend,\
  \ we stayed in the hotel near the center of the city. Yes, we stayed in the place\
  \ where the most crowd does exist. It wasn\u2019t because we like the crowd \u2013\
  \ only so could we find anything a lot easier. During the stay, we rented a motorbike\
  \ since the city is full of traffic and motorbike is always the best option \u2013\
  \ especially in Indonesia \u2013 to shorten the arrival time and of course, to enjoy\
  \ the wind and scenery better.\n\nWhen you visit a city with great nature in it,\
  \ make sure you never miss a chance to see sunset or sunrise. Either in the hills\
  \ or the beaches, the sunset and sunrise always creates such remarkable scenery\
  \ in any place you are in. And that\u2019s why my friend and I decided to step outside\
  \ the hotel at 3 AM, and rode the motorbike for 1,5-2 hours to get to the hill for\
  \ sunrise. For a moment I felt lucky because I brought my sweater because seriously,\
  \ the wind is pretty cold and freezing.  But I could say it was all worth it.\n\n\
  We got lost several times because the maps gave us wrong direction. It was 4 AM\
  \ and we saw nobody but the trees and a few houses. It was pitch black and lucky\
  \ we have the headlight so the road was not that dark. We turned around and after\
  \ 15 minutes found dead ends everywhere, we could finally make our way back to the\
  \ main road. Because the maps kept showing us the false direction, we decided to\
  \ use our intuition to make it to the hill; since the hill is pretty close already.\
  \ \n\nSince we have no idea where the hill is and our phone signals was slowly nowhere\
  \ to be found, we only took the main road and any climb, because logically the hill\
  \ is supposed to be there. The logic was proven correct, but it wasn\u2019t the\
  \ hill we were supposed to be. It was more like a wild forest with dry leaves and\
  \ branches along the track. Because we almost reached the dead end, so we decided\
  \ to park the motorbike near the forest and walked there. After a few minutes walking,\
  \ a spot where it shows the sky was found and we decided to follow it. \n\nWe kept\
  \ on walking until I couldn\u2019t believe what I just saw as we reached the spot.\
  \ It shows the line of small houses which are surrounded by the rice fields down\
  \ there, also with the mountain and trees around it. It truly took my breath away\
  \ that I didn\u2019t expect such a view does exist in place like this. Another good\
  \ thing is, that spot is also where the sunrise happens; so we didn\u2019t miss\
  \ the moment. Right in time, the sun began to appear and showed its shine slowly.\
  \ And it\u2019s true; about what people said. It was so beautiful and I must say,\
  \ I didn\u2019t regret for going up here on 3 AM, getting lost here and there, and\
  \ ended up in the unknown place \u2013 it was all worth it. There is a saying \u2018\
  never judge a book by its cover\u2019; and it actually goes to things like this\
  \ as well. Never judge any place because who knows that you might find a greater\
  \ view than those famous places you visit."
