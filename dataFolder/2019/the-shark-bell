Text: "It was Dunedin where I first saw ghosts. \n\nI thought I\u2019d felt cold before:\
  \ afternoons that slowly turned bitter, winter evenings with creeping fingers of\
  \ damp. There was nothing slow about this cold. It announced itself. When I opened\
  \ the door, Oliver threw an arm across my shoulders. He pointed at something white\
  \ on the ground. \u201CIce.\u201D We tiptoed to the car, clambered into the back\
  \ seat, heard the engine splutter in the gloom. The car hurtled down empty streets,\
  \ the tin roofs around us beginning to glow in the morning sun. Day one of our Dunedin\
  \ tour. \n\nOliver drove fast, turning his head to fling facts into our laps. \u201C\
  That\u2019s the university\u2014you\u2019ll recognise the clocktower\u2014look,\
  \ you can see it poking its head through. Lots of history there. When do you plan\
  \ to start studying?\u201D\n\n\u201CNext year. February.\u201D Chris\u2019s voice\
  \ couldn\u2019t mask his fear, and Oliver laughed. \u201CThe famous railway station\
  \ on your left.\u201D He gestured at a brown and white building. \u201CAnd look\
  \ out on your right, that\u2019s the back of First Church.\u201D A mass of stone\
  \ hunched on the cliff above us.    \n\nWe slipped on to the motorway. Now the sun\
  \ was up, and the harbour gleamed. Oliver turned the wheel and rows of little matchbox\
  \ houses appeared, neatly stacked along streets that looked barely wide enough even\
  \ for one car. \n\n\u201CCaversham. And South Dunedin. The old rugby ground, Carisbrook,\
  \ that\u2019s near here too, if we keep going in.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt looks\u2026\
  poor.\u201D\n\n\u201COh, it was. Is. Not quite the student slums\u201D\u2014Oliver\
  \ flicked us a grin in the mirror\u2014\u201Cbut they\u2019re pretty wretched inside.\u201D\
  \ The houses slumped against each other in defeat. Some were missing bricks. Others\
  \ had lost their paint and stood naked, weatherboards streaked with salt. \n\n\u201C\
  I think my granddad lived around here.\u201D Now I\u2019d said it out loud, I was\
  \ sure of it. I tried to imagine his long frame folding to squeeze into one of the\
  \ tiny rooms. His father vanished when he was a child; his mother worked seven days\
  \ a week, washing and mending clothes.\n\t\nThe car turned again and this time we\
  \ faced the ocean\u2014not the still harbour, but the wild sea. \u201CSaint Clair,\u201D\
  \ Oliver announced. He waved his hand at a grey building over the road and I could\
  \ just make out the sign: 'Est. 1868'. At home, history was something in a textbook.\
  \ At school we studied Tudor kings and queens. I\u2019d never thought of history\
  \ as something you could touch, something that sprang up around you. \n\nWe walked\
  \ down the beach, shivering despite the sun. Now and then a sleek black figure appeared\
  \ on top of a wave, bobbing up and down as it raced to the shore. Oliver led us\
  \ up to a tall wooden post. A large bell hung from the end. \n\n\u201CShark Warning\
  \ Bell,\u201D Chris read, glancing nervously at the surfers. \u201CThere are sharks\
  \ here? I thought it was too cold.\u201D\n\n\u201CHeaps of them out past the breakers,\
  \ apparently. Great whites. Don\u2019t worry.\u201D Oliver chuckled at our faces.\
  \ \u201CThey don\u2019t come into the harbour\u2014well, not often.\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  Then why\u2026?\u201D \n\n\u201CThere were some attacks in the sixties. Three boys\
  \ from the surf club died. Here, you can read their names.\u201D We looked down\
  \ at the plaque under our feet. Leslie Jordan. William Black. Graeme Hitt. \u201C\
  They made this bell to warn swimmers. It\u2019s not really used now. They put shark\
  \ nets in after the last attack.\u201D\n\nOliver paused reverentially. Now I could\
  \ see them: three boys running down the stretch of wet sand, surfboards tucked under\
  \ their arms, no footprints behind them. A snatch of laughter carried up to where\
  \ we stood. I blinked and the boys disappeared. A wave thundered in.  \n\n\u201C\
  Here, pretend to ring it.\u201D Oliver handed Chris a rope and he tugged it gingerly.\
  \ The sound was small: just a single \u2018ting\u2019, and Oliver shook his head\
  \ at Chris\u2019s attempt. But somehow the bell kept ringing. On and on it rang,\
  \ reverberating through my eardrums, the ghost of an echo calling through the years."
