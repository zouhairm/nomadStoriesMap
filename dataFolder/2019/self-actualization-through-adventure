Text: "Every soul craves to wander but there are very few who actually listen to the\
  \ signs and calls of their wandering dreams waiting to come true, the only thing\
  \ needed to make them come true is the courage to leave all the fear behind.\n\n\
  I left my job to go on a trip with friends as it was my first trip outside town.\
  \ Exploring different places always inspired me but only thing i had done before\
  \ that trip was to walk for kilometres on the unknown roads and find new places,\
  \ observe new people and learn culture where it is demonstrated best. I wasn't doing\
  \ good in my Anthropology major at that point of time but i was certainly getting\
  \ inspired by the beauty of this world.\n\nSo, the trip began and there wasn't any\
  \ mention of the job i had left in my mind and the quarrel that i had to face at\
  \ home to come hear. The only thing in my mind was this craving to experience all\
  \ this nature around me and to dive into the water. Cutting through mountains, the\
  \ road took us to the land of divinity. The world yoga centre 'Rishikesh', one could\
  \ easily see the mixture of spirituality, lust to find oneself, adventure and business.\
  \ Or maybe only i saw that because my friends saw good looking foreign girls, photography\
  \ spots and long walks which is one perception and their own sense of reality.\n\
  \nRishikesh's diverse culture could be an eye candy to anyone, people from different\
  \ parts of  the world coming here to find their purpose of life in this was cosmic\
  \ sea. Although, one finds his/her purpose according to their own perspective and\
  \ the limitations of their intellectual capability but that purpose is the reality\
  \ for this person. One can learn the art of objective substantiation to a great\
  \ extent on these divine banks of Ganges.\n\nAdventure always pulled me and i never\
  \ resisted because it has given me the actual value of life. So, my first adventure\
  \ was to walk 27 kilometres all around rishikesh to see rishikesh at its best. All\
  \ my friends who also happen to be gym freaks couldn't bear it after 5 kilometres\
  \ and were taking rest everywhere i stopped to take pictures or just to enjoy the\
  \ view. That's when i actualised my inner wanderlust and the energy new places fill\
  \ inside me. \n\nHere comes the actual adventure, we were on the bank of the river\
  \ ganges in a place called 'Shivpuri', named after the almighty god 'Shiv'. We were\
  \ being given instruction on how make sure of your safety in river while you enjoy\
  \ white water rafting in  one of the mightiest river 'Ganges'. Even though everybody\
  \ was scared, i was both scared and excited and wanted to experience the biggest\
  \ rapid of all time and wanted to jump in the river without support so, that this\
  \ universal energy inside river could provide me the first hand experience of nature's\
  \ power.\n\nWith a great experience of thrill and adrenaline rush we reached a break\
  \ point and i stood facing my all time love 'Cliff Jumping'. To some people jumping\
  \ from a 30 feet cliff is a child's play but for me it was my biggest adventure\
  \ at that point of time. We headed towards the top to jump and it felt like an eternity\
  \ to see the flow from the top. A small stardust called human who thinks that his\
  \ problems are too big and he couldn't get through them, stood facing the might\
  \ of nature and was now about to make a jump into a whole new world of adventure.\
  \ As i stood there facing the blazing sun, the flow of ganges below me and my heart\
  \ pounding due to fear as if its going to come out of my chest, the time stood paused\
  \ and the world went silent and as i pushed myself off of the cliff, the blood rushed\
  \ through my heart and i flew for 10 seconds in the air before my leap ended me\
  \ being in the lap of a near death experience and as i rose above i lived again\
  \ with my first breath."
