Text: "9:35pm. Mozambique's border to South Africa. The bus stops and everyone needs\
  \ to get off. Sleepyhead, I don't know what\u2019s happening, I stare out of the\
  \ window. \u201CThat must be it,\u201D I think, although I can't see much beyond\
  \ a distant wooden house with a sort of half-flashing light. I leave the bus, and\
  \ the rain gets my face wet, at least makes me feel more awake. Stepping through\
  \ mud and stones, I follow the flow and I go in search of the queue to pass through\
  \ the border. I see the wooden house closer, only to discover that's actually the\
  \ immigration office and there is no queue or information whatsoever. I enter and\
  \ hear an empty silence, I see a clock on the wall displaying a 2-hour delay from\
  \ the proper time. I walk in past the front area and what I see is roughly 40 men\
  \ waiting to be attended. I am the only female. Finally, my turn comes and I stand\
  \ by the booth to listen to the man speaking to me in my mother language \"Brazilian?\
  \ Why leaving so fast?\u201D. I think \"Well, it has been 2 weeks since I arrived\
  \ in Mozambique.\" \u201CTime to go,\u201D I tell him \u201Cbut it has been great\u2026\
  \ thank you, I guess!\u201D. The stamp is given and he calls for the next one in\
  \ line. That is the end of the world, and against all odds, we all speak the same\
  \ language. Is the world a big place after all? Back in the rain, I wonder what\
  \ to do without any guidance. The bus I came in is no longer there. I walk 200 meters\
  \ towards South Africa, which makes me feel bit safer but not to the point where\
  \ I would forget the wild area I'm approaching, where all animals we like to see\
  \ on safaris live wild and free. Finally, I arrive at another immigration shack\
  \ opposed to the one I just left. The officer this time looks me in the eye as who\
  \ thinks \"Are you lost?\u201D. But he doesn't mention a word towards me, and instead,\
  \ I got my passport stamped one more time as he kept checking what seemed to be\
  \ a local TV channel. I find my way out and walk extra 100 meters to actually put\
  \ myself out of Mozambique, and by this time I can see some buses parked ahead,\
  \ and guards putting out the suitcases and brutally opening them all. My gut tells\
  \ me that is more like a scene than actually an inspection, anyone who would like\
  \ to cross with, hum lets say, less appropriate luggage would be more than ok. Who\
  \ would care anyway? We are all hostages of the darkness tonight. My luggage is\
  \ finally released as I intend to return to my sit. The driver standing by the entrance\
  \ door asks for my ticket. Alright, I've got one. After checking it, he lifts his\
  \ face and tells me \u201CYour ticket gets you until Komatiport only\u201D and I\
  \ placidly say \u201CI know, that's where I am going\u201D, he blocks the doorway\
  \ saying \u201CDarling, you are already here, now get your bags and clean the way\u201D\
  . Wait, what? I can feel the coldness rising behind my spine, and this time wasn\u2019\
  t because of the cold rain. \u201CHere, you mean, here?\u201D I ask pointing towards\
  \ the nothingness we are on. \u201CYou telling me my stop is in between two countries\
  \ in the middle of a road?\u201D (Read with the appropriate desperate intonation).\
  \ \"Is this even legal?\". But at this point who cares what is legal or not, every\
  \ man is for themselves. I just have to try to find my way out of here. Probably\
  \ touched by my \"trying to play cool face\" the driver asks me: \u201DWho is coming\
  \ to pick you up, darling?\u201D. The movie of my life passes in front of me, I\
  \ take a deep breath in and say \u201CI will take a taxi\u201D. Sooner than I thought,\
  \ I hear the words I knew were on the way \u201CDarling, there is no such thing\
  \ as taxis here\u201D. 11h15pm. I am in South Africa. I sit and start to pray to\
  \ be ready for the unknown."
