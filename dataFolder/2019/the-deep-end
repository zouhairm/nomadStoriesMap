Text: "The first day I found out about cenotes was the same day we found a sign inside\
  \ Chichen Itza, saying that that the ancient Aztecs used to throw sacrificed bodies\
  \ down them. The sign stood right in front of the rails of the cenote, as if strategically\
  \ placed so that we could lean over and better imagine how it must have been like,\
  \ to be thrown down into the bottomless waterhole. \n\nWe were four single young\
  \ women on this Cancun trip, out for sun, adventure, and fun. Out of us girls, only\
  \ two of us were willing to jump into the cenotes. The first one we tried was the\
  \ cenote Ik-Kil. The place was packed with tourists, excited crowds wanting to experience\
  \ its renowned beauty. We opted out of wearing the life jackets and went straight\
  \ for the water. \n\nAs a child, I had a fear of drowning. And honestly, it still\
  \ lingers to this day, no matter how many times I've gone into the waters and dived.\
  \ The thought of being submerged underwater for long periods of time, without oxygen,\
  \ always filled me with dread.  When us girls agreed to go on a trip together to\
  \ Cancun, I knew there would be water-related activities involved. But, there would\
  \ also be the kind of tourism I enjoyed, such as good food and rich local history,\
  \ and sometimes to get to what you want, you have to take a chance and push past\
  \ your comfort zone. \n\nThere was a moment, after having slipped in and treading\
  \ water in the centre of Ik-Kil, where I was struck by the incredible beauty of\
  \ this place, that faraway circular sky framed by the rocks and leaves. A beauty\
  \ that you feel deep in your soul, seeping through the insides of your water soaked\
  \ body.\n\nOf course, the thought that followed soon after was, \"Okay, I'm swimming\
  \ without a life jacket, and if I drown here, there's literally no end to this sinkhole.\"\
  \n\nEven after I rushed to swim back to the edges of safety, the image of the sky\
  \ opening at Ik Kil still stuck in my mind.  \n\nAll my life, I've been afraid of\
  \ drowning. But, I never wanted to let that fear stop me from experiencing what\
  \ beauty the world had to offer. Sometimes this means taking a chance and facing\
  \ your fears, to see where you come out of on the other side. \n\nA few days later,\
  \ we were at another cenote, this time a smaller one in the Riviera Maya area, with\
  \ just us girls and our tour guides. We had life jackets on this time around, and\
  \ one of the tour guide's assistant called out at us from the waters to jump.\n\n\
  I could spend my whole time in the water imagining the watery grave below me, ancient\
  \ bones of sacrificed bodies, imagining the feeling of drowning into the bottomless\
  \ water. \n\nOr, I could kick my feet, trust in my life jacket and my own swimming\
  \ abilities, and look up. \n\nOnce inside the waters, my friend beckoned me to follow\
  \ her, and we ducked under the rocks, out of sight from the other two girls who\
  \ didn't want to jump in, and the tour guides. On the other side, we found a beautiful\
  \ circle sky above us, overgrowth on the rocks framing the picture. Neither of us\
  \ had a water proof camera, and we would have nothing to remember this moment by\
  \ except in our shared memory, quietly floating above water under that particular\
  \ sky. \n\nThe next and last time someone asked me to jump during that trip, we\
  \ were at the eco-water park called Xel-Ha. The signs read \"Cliff jumping\", one\
  \ of the many options of activities to do while we floated down the lazy river.\
  \ I stood at the ledge, my friends having already jumped into the water calling\
  \ out to me to join them. \n\nThe truth is, I am still afraid of drowning. The unknowable\
  \ watery deeps still frightens me. Even so, the more I go into the water, the more\
  \ I trust that I know how to swim and be able to resurface. \n\nSo I looked out\
  \ over the ledge, and jump."
