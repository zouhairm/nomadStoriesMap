Text: "The moment I was accepted at university in London with Journalism, I knew I\
  \ had to do one last thing before leaving my motherland Bulgaria behind my back.\
  \ Somewhere deep in my heart I felt the need to stop time and start wandering in\
  \ the mountain nooks of Rhodopes with my family. Rozmari De Meo, a Bulgarian writer\
  \ known for performing the ancient sacred Bulgarian ritual of \u201Ccalling the\
  \ joy\u201D, has a saying: \u201CTo be happy, you need to reconnect with your roots.\
  \ Do not be a single branch in the forest: find your tree.\u201D\n   During the\
  \ one-week journey in the Rhodope mountains we visited numerous places that made\
  \ us connected to something bigger, even than the Universe itself. Our haven in\
  \ Smolyan town where we engulfed sunbeams, fresh air and organic food, was called\
  \ \u201CChapov\u201D. Located only two kilometres from Smolyan\u2019s lakes, it\
  \ is a traditional, three-storey, untouched by time and modernization house, hidden\
  \ mysteriously behind a high fence. I spent every morning with a boiling hot cup\
  \ of sweetened milk on one of the logs in its pretty garden, which had a palette\
  \ of flowers more abundant in colour than the rainbow. The owner of the chalet,\
  \ grandpa Stoyan, prepared breakfast typical for the region- rodopski patatnik,\
  \ rodopski klin or katchamak. We devoured every bit of these delectable dishes to\
  \ gain enough power for adventures and new knowledge with our old cherry-coloured\
  \ friend, Renault 19.\n   We had the chance to tickle our palate and actually make\
  \ a difference between various kinds of cheese and milk. In Smilyan, a hamlet embraced\
  \ by the mountain\u2019s hands, we went to the \u201CDairy Inn\u201D, where we tried\
  \ home-made Bulgarian yogurt with strawberry jam. It was one of a kind dessert,\
  \ not solely because of bacillus bulgaricus, the bacteria used in the yogurt that\
  \ can be found only in Bulgaria. What contributed enchantingly to the taste sensations\
  \ were the wild strawberries, forming the marmalade\u2019s consistency. For a while,\
  \ with the spoon in my mouth, I started thinking about how properly handmade food\
  \ and icy air penetrating our lungs with its purity can lift our spirits. Before\
  \ this holiday, I had never woken up so early in my life, rejuvenated and clear\
  \ of toxic thoughts. And while most of the people search for happiness in the immense\
  \ beauty of Indian villages and their gurus, I found my India in the core of Rhodoppes\
  \ with its good-humoured shepherds.\n   After we recharged our physical batteries,\
  \ it was time to thrill our souls with the peculiar landscape revealed from Orpheus\
  \ rocks. They fill your body with adrenaline and gratification when you reach the\
  \ top, and are ideal for non-experienced hikers. The whole Smolyan shines with his\
  \ red roofs and white chalet houses at the foot of the mountain, and you can get\
  \ to the village really fast if you are not careful with the steep cliffs. The magical\
  \ atmosphere coming from the rocks is still tangible, as if Orpheus, captivating\
  \ in his sorrow over the loss of his wife-to-be Eurydice, hides somewhere in the\
  \ bushes and plays mesmerizing, yet dramatic melodies with the help of leaves.\n\
  \   Not only did we take delight in gazing at the astonishing nature of Rhodopes,\
  \ but we also turned our look to the stars. We had the chance to visit NAO (National\
  \ Astronomical Laboratory) Rozhen, the biggest on the Balkans, and cast a glance\
  \ at the Sun. This reminded us what tiny particles we are, and yet how much we brim\
  \ with life-constructing energy.\n   The final stop of our trip was Snezhanka tower,\
  \ which unveils scenery beyond description. Our breaths were taken away when we\
  \ caught sight of the Aegean Sea along with Rila, Pirin and Rhodope mountains from\
  \ the caf\xE9 on the last floor. \n   On our last day in Chapov chalet grandpa Stoyan\
  \ showed us a corner of his garden we had not noticed before. There he grew Leontopodium,\
  \ an endangered flower included in the Red Book of Bulgaria. \u201CYour life is\
  \ as important as this plant\u2019s. Make sure you always water it, give it space\
  \ to grow, and cherish it,\u201D he smiled and gave us seeds as a gratitude for\
  \ being his guests."
