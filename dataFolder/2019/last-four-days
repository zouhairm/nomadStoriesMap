Text: "It was the last day of our trip and we were on our way to Phnom Penh Airport\
  \ to fly back home. As I rode on the local ride called \"tuk tuk\"  I embarked upon\
  \ our amazing last seven days in Vietnam and finally the Angkor Wat day of Cambodia.\
  \ As I looked at two of my trip partners who shared the tuk tuk with  me, I realised\
  \ that was how my face would look like too, full of exhaustion yet oddly at peace\
  \ and mind filled with our truly exhilarating experience in life so far.\n\nIt all\
  \ happened at lightning speed. I heard a motorbike accelerate and saw a guy who\
  \  stretched from his seat to snatch one of our bags. All three of us could only\
  \ simply stare at the bike with the guys who now had our bag. With a terrible shock,\
  \ I realised the worst truth that all three of us had our  passports in that bag.\
  \ We kept screaming at our driver to follow them but he dint seem to understand\
  \ us, or did he?\n\nThere started our true exploration of Cambodia right from the\
  \ police station to the embassies to immigration offices and airports. Every day\
  \ presented us with a new experience that we never sought to achieve. From the officer\
  \ who tried to feel my palm to the countless bribes and insults on one side, some\
  \ kind acts from the embassy that helped us get home soon or the native food that\
  \ we got from the hotel nearby on the other side, we three truly lived a life time\
  \ in those four days.\n\nI was fed, given medicine and was taken care of in every\
  \ way that only my family could have done by my trip partners who by now had become\
  \ my friends, my boys.. It is at the worst of our times that we come to know how\
  \ capable enough are we to resist, to be resilient and more importantly to love.\
  \ We cried in agony when we were denied our duplicate passport first and then we\
  \ cried in joy when we finally got our return tickets hugging each other like kids.\
  \ \n\nOn my flight home, besides having had the worst experience, images of Cambodia\
  \ kept flashing inside my head; its beautiful night life at the pub street, the\
  \ way people from all over the world seem to have dancing along the streets without\
  \ a care in the world. It was freedom at its ultimate. Nobody could deny the energy\
  \ the place seems to emanate at night. Oddly, Cambodia,I felt safest at night. Sadly\n\
  , same could not be told about its day time life. It felt as though the city Phnom\
  \ Penh  sleeps during day time with only the Gods atop those gorgeous steep mountains\
  \ awake to guard the city and while the Gods sleep, the mankind wakes at night to\
  \ its mischievous ways.\n\nYet now as I safely lay on my bed at home, and look back\
  \ at our trip, all I can remember are those last four days. For the world, Cambodia\
  \ could be AngkorWat and countless magnificent temples, but for me, Cambodia is\
  \ me and my two friends and the bond that I dint expect to find between us. \"I\
  \ \"went for a trip and \"we\" came back is all I can say!"
