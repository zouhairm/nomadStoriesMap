Text: "Men yelled out rhythmically, the way only salespeople at old local markets\
  \ know how to do, swaying you to their stands to buy local produce of all colors,\
  \ shapes, and sizes. Rows of stands emerged along the way, all following the same\
  \ direction as the line of cars and a river of people walking next to it.\n\nEnormous\
  \ parking lot emerges. It is is the end of the road for my friend. Can not follow\
  \ me through, does not have the permit. He stops and asks for help an old lady and\
  \ her teenage son passing by us. If they are already going this way, it means they\
  \ have the permits. They just need to navigate me through to the other side. It\
  \ is in their culture not to refuse to help others.\n\nBig plastic bags they both\
  \ had swaying down are filled with a variety of trinkets. For them, this is a daily\
  \ commute. They make a living by buying items at the market on this side of the\
  \ wall, carry them through and sell on the other side at a higher price. Everything\
  \ is more expensive on the other side.\n\nNoon sun shines brightly above us until\
  \ we enter the darkness of a massive metal construction serving as a checkpoint.\
  \ Lines of people squeezing through rows of metal bars on each side, waiting for\
  \ the light to go green above the one way revolving bars passing one by one through.\
  \ But not all the way through.\n\nMany rules to follow and not enough time to understand.\
  \ People are in a hurry. They want to get through. They have jobs to get to, life\
  \ to live. Nobody wants to wait for a foreigner, a tourist to understand the reality\
  \ of this place. The old lady, my helper, notices puzzled look on my face and with\
  \ a shrug says: \u201CIt is normal.\u201D \n\nOnce I got the green light and passed\
  \ through I found myself in a room with illuminating lights so strong my eyes take\
  \ a toll. The place is equipped with a security scanner and a metal detector, but\
  \ something is missing. People. People are missing. \n\nInstructions are shouted\
  \ at us through the speakers and cameras are covering every angle. The old lady,\
  \ my helper, pushes me toward a small, bulletproof window where I just have to flash\
  \ my passport. I am a foreigner and thus allowed to cross. They do not even take\
  \ my passport to inspect it. They do not care about anyone else, only one nation.\
  \ Old lady and her son get a completely different, harsh treatment involving even\
  \ scanning their fingers to prove their identity.\n\nI felt obliged to repay the\
  \ kindness they showed me and thought helping with collecting all their trinkets\
  \ from security scanner convey belt would do just that. When I started placing them\
  \ back in plastic bags, speakers started rumbling with noise. I do not understand\
  \ the words but understand the expression of the old lady and her son. People behind\
  \ the glass were not happy with my action.\n\nThey wanted me to get out. The light\
  \ was green on the one way revolving metal bars at the other side of the room, leading\
  \ out into the light. The old lady pushes me out. She, on the other hand, could\
  \ not go. I do not want to leave her. She did nothing wrong. She urges me not to\
  \ make it worse and to leave; she will manage. It is not her first rodeo.\n\nI wait\
  \ outside, do not want to get into the bus. After a while, her teenage son gets\
  \ out and urges me to go into the bus that is leaving soon. They will catch the\
  \ next one, or the one after it, depending on when they release her. Reluctantly,\
  \ I get on the bus, shaking. We drive off, with old lady still not appearing in\
  \ the light of day. Three-meter wall follows along the way.\n\nQalandia stayed behind\
  \ me, together with an old Palestinian lady who showed me so much kindness and got\
  \ punished for it, on my way to Jerusalem."
