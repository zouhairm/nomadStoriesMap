Text: "I watched the driver nonchalantly hauled our backpacks onto the roof of his\
  \ tuk tuk. His was like no other tuk tuks. It was longer, wider, taller, and more\
  \ durable to transport his passengers and their goods off to a greater distance\
  \ than the regular ones could. \n\nThere wasn\u2019t much to glean from the internet\
  \ about getting to Thi Lo Su waterfall in Umphang by public transport. \n\n\u201C\
  Basically, all we have to do is to get to Mae Sot. It\u2019s a border town with\
  \ Myanmar. From there, if we are lucky, we might catch a tuk tuk to Umphang.\u201D\
  \ I said hesitantly.\n\n\u201CGood enough for me!\u201D Jeremy answered. \n\nMae\
  \ Sot is only a muddy river away from Myanmar, connected by a bridge through which\
  \ pedestrians and cars alike, transported mountains of goods on their back into\
  \ Myanmar. Across, a colony of metal huts set roots on the acrid ground, hardly\
  \ any trees survived. Less affluent huts were dressed in colorful tarps as roof.\
  \ Topless men roared as they played a game of soccer, copper dust trailed behind\
  \ their steps. I turned around and looked at Thailand, oddly opulent in comparison-\
  \ vendors guarded their giant tiger prawns and Burmese whiskey behind makeshift\
  \ stalls. Ironically, people looked more tired and worried. \n\nBack in the tuk\
  \ tuk van, our local companions shared mangosteen and rambutans with us. They wore\
  \ what Muslim in Malaysia would traditionally wear- sarong for men and head cover\
  \ for women. I felt a sense of familiarity, having grown up in Malaysia myself.\
  \ Half way through the journey, a young man joined us. He greeted us in English\
  \ and asked where we were going. \n\n\u201CUmphang.\u201D Jeremy answered. \n\n\u201C\
  I haven\u2019t been there. But that\u2019s about 2-3 hours away.\u201D, he said\
  \ pensively. \n\n\u201CYou speak English well, I hope it\u2019s not rude to ask\
  \ you how you learnt.\u201D, I asked curiously. He told us that he grew up in a\
  \ Burmese refugee camp where Australian missionaries would teach children English.\
  \ He was going home to visit his family. When the tuk tuk unloaded some passengers,\
  \ I realized his home was still a refugee camp. It wasn\u2019t until much later\
  \ that I thought about him again, when the Rohingyas conflict occurred in 2017.\
  \ \n\nWe arrived in Umphang Wildlife Sanctuary, only to discover an unexpected hike\
  \ awaiting us. It was already 4:30pm; we quickly decided that we\u2019d have to\
  \ arrive in the first camp base before nightfall. With two 70L backpacks crammed\
  \ with one week\u2019s worth of camping supplies, we began the ascent. The sun raged\
  \ on mercilessly that even opening my eyes was excruciating, especially when salty\
  \ sweat streamed into them like acid. \n\nThe sun set minutes after we set up our\
  \ tent. We bathed by the tap under the moonlight, squealing like school girls with\
  \ each pail of cold water sent down our bodies. The next day, we left the camp for\
  \ the remaining 13km hike. Soon, a vehicle approached, carrying women and their\
  \ rattan bags in the trunk. The driver gestured us to hop on. I thought, \u201C\
  Who are these women? This leads to nowhere. Is there a settlement by the waterfall?\u201D\
  . Shortly after, the vehicle stopped, and the women climbed out. They disappeared\
  \ into jungle like the experience was hallucination from our dehydration. \n\nWe\
  \ hitched another ride to the final camping site. After setting up our tent and\
  \ greeting the custodian of the sanctuary, we ventured into the jungle towards the\
  \ waterfall. Our first encounter with Thi Lo Su waterfall was this gentle splashing\
  \ echo that became more enlivened and thunderous as we drew closer. We fastened\
  \ our steps, picturing all the possible images that we were about to witness. \n\
  \nThen, there it was. The multistoried waterfall sat calmly among the tropical rainforest,\
  \ so pristine and raw that one could almost be certain that they looked quite the\
  \ same since the beginning of time. It was like they too had been waiting for our\
  \ arrival. At night, fireflies danced in the forest, illuminating the trees like\
  \ Christmas lights. I believe that exploration is a primitive and fulfilling aspect\
  \ of being human. Nothing compares to the deep satisfaction of discovery- \u201C\
  Hmm, I\u2019ve known it\u2026\u201D."
