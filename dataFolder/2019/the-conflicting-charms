Text: "\u201CI think we\u2019re lost!\u201D my friend says, as he is starring at his\
  \ map in one hand and struggling to hold his umbrella steady on the other. The wind\
  \ is blowing stronger and the rain drops are getting heavier\u2026 not making it\
  \ any easier for us to find our way to the harbor to catch the morning ferry. \n\
  \ \n\u201CLet\u2019s ask for direction.\u201D as I fixate on my sole goal today,\
  \ to catch the ferry\u2026 away from the city.\n\nWe finally reach the harbor and\
  \ excitement kicked in. At last\u2026 away from the city.\n\n \u201CNo tickets to\
  \ Procida, Capri or anywhere, ferries not operating today, bad weather!\u201D said\
  \ the the officer.\n\nApparently we\u2019re not going away from the city after all\u2026\
  \ Naples would not let us go!\n\nWe arrived in Naples Airport the night before,\
  \ headed to Positano, one of the scenic villages in Amalfi Coast, 35 miles from\
  \ Naples. I was so excited by the exquisite reputation of Amalfi Coast, and Positano\
  \ did not fail me. I fell in love with its colorful terraced houses, narrow hilly\
  \ pathways, calm turquois sea, cute shops, heavenly delicious pasta and even its\
  \ endless stairways. Had I had it my way, I would spend the whole weekend there.\
  \ Nevertheless, traveling with a buddy entails compromises. Thus, we settled on\
  \ spending one night in Naples instead. \n\nThe first taste of Naples after Positano\
  \ was nothing less than flabbergasting. Grueling traffic, narrow, dark and rather\
  \ dirty alley where there was literally no space between our taxi and the crowd\
  \ jamming in the alley. Almost all the walls in the alleys are covered with graffiti.\
  \ Several caf\xE9s and bars lined up with over flowing customers. We navigated vigilantly\
  \ to find our B&B, tucked in the middle of what supposedly Naples historic center.\
  \ The B&B is on the 3rd floor of a shady building with cracked wall, dimmed lights\
  \ and no elevator. As we nervously climbed up the dusty stairs, we settled our next\
  \ day itinerary: away from the city!\n\nThe rain is still pouring, rubbing on our\
  \ shattered plan. Refusing to be defeated, let\u2019s make the best out of what\
  \ we have and see what Naples has to offer.\n\nWe walk back to the historic district\
  \ toward via San Gregorio Armeno. The street is loaded with people, but surprisingly\
  \ daytime provides quite a different outlook than the night. Now that the shops\
  \ are open, most of the graffiti is hidden by the stalls and store displays. The\
  \ alley looks dazzling with festive colors of various handmade crafts. Mostly have\
  \ Christmas nativity theme such as baby Jesus, Madonna and angels. There\u2019re\
  \ also lots of miniature pizzerias, waterfalls, fruit market and my favorite, the\
  \ butcher stall complete with meats. \u201CIt\u2019s tradition, Presepe\u201D the\
  \ owner says. It\u2019s a tradition during Christmas for families to build Presepe,\
  \ the nativity scene, using various figurines and crafts. \n\nThe rain has stopped\
  \ though still cloudy. We move towards Chiaia on the seafront.  This neighborhood\
  \ seems more affluent, the streets are cleaner and the atmosphere is calmer. Unlike\
  \ the previous parts of the city where graffiti can be found on the main roads,\
  \ the walls here are spotless. \n\nThe clouds have stepped away and the sky is bright\
  \ as we continue to the hillside. We stop in Posillipo where we see the city from\
  \ above. The houses curve along the bay, the smooth sea line and then the sparkling\
  \ blue water. At the far end, there\u2019s Vesuvius, active volcano that destroyed\
  \ Pompeii, lurking over Naples with its alarming grandeur. We stand there silently\
  \ feasting on this stunning view.\n\nAt dusk on our way to the Airport, I encounter\
  \ the same sight of the messy crowds, the filthy streets, and the graffiti on the\
  \ walls. But now I see them differently. I see Naples in its distinctive characters.\
  \ The 3rd largest city in Italy that deemed to be one of the poorest and chaotic\
  \ city in Europe, a tainted reputation due to harsh history of Camorra, the Italian\
  \ mafia. Yet, the city is filled with vibrant energy, striving to transform itself.\
  \ It carries rich culture and undeniably captivating vistas.  Naples with its conflicting\
  \ charms\u2026 leaving us the choice on how to embrace it\u2026 just like life."
