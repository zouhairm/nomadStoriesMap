Text: "I don\u2019t normally go on a trip just for the sake of it. Most of my travel\
  \ adventures aim on studying or offering family support (that\u2019s how I once\
  \ ended up in a Chinese Opera summer school in Shanghai and attended a biochemistry\
  \ congress in Russia). Last January I turned down long-expected sunny days and hot\
  \ nights in Brazil for the company of my sister and five-year-old niece in a gray\
  \ cold village in Germany. My mission was to be there for them, keep their hearts\
  \ warm and their apartment mold free.\n\nGatersleben is a less than 3000-resident\
  \ village in the state of Saxony-Anhalt - countryside, some three-hour travel from\
  \ Berlin. I had no idea great world powers had such small towns! True, they are\
  \ all connected by a sophisticated transport infrastructure, but we\u2019d still\
  \ smell manure from the over four hundred year-old farm very close to the train\
  \ station. \n\nLocal history dates back to the 13th century and it is thoroughly\
  \ documented in a book I borrowed from the library. The nostalgia of borrowing a\
  \ book added to the fact that the village was a living document itself. I traveled\
  \ back to Middle Age with the rocky fortress walls spread around. A forest and a\
  \ stream surrounding one of the most ancient buildings made me think of crocodiles\
  \ and catfishes that surely guarded town hundreds of years ago.\n\nIn modern days\
  \ lots of history remain. For example, the place where my sister stores unwanted\
  \ furniture and parks the bikes during the night was once a stable. Other habitants\
  \ live in buildings from the communism decades. I would normally get lost in that\
  \ area, since the buildings looked all the same. Were they some square meters smaller,\
  \ they would be very similar to the standardized ones of nowadays.\n\nWhen it come\
  \ to standards in Germany, one may say it reaches deep levels of life in society.\
  \ So I wondered while performing my housework duties. I had never seen a neighborhood\
  \ so fully assisted by a waste recycling service and occupied by residents so concerned\
  \ about the correct disposal of the trash. I suppose that\u2019s part of a particular\
  \ sense of living together. Simple things like agreeing among neighbors whose turn\
  \ it is of cleaning the corridors were insights on how living in society varies\
  \ around the world.\n\nLiving in society maybe tough too, especially in an unknown\
  \ one. My sister has the habit of going out with her hair wet, because of the hot\
  \ weather in our country. My niece developed the same habit (it\u2019s very hard\
  \ to change a five year-old\u2019s mind) and kept doing it even in cold German days.\
  \ Kid\u2019s normally very healthy, but once a neighbor mom warned my sister she\
  \ may be reprehended by government authorities for such \u201Cneglect\u201D.\n\n\
  One may feel very suspicious. In a town that must have been used as scenario for\
  \ \u201CDark\u201D Netflix series, I didn\u2019t expect to find local cordiality.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t find anyone in the streets when I got lost amidst a sudden snow\
  \ blizzard in a rare sun-shining afternoon. Nor there was anyone passing by to help\
  \ me when my bag tore apart and all glass bottles I was taking to recycle fell on\
  \ the street. These were quiet, lonely bike adventures. Meditations on persistence\
  \ and resilience took place.\n\nNevertheless, routine may build ways to get to know\
  \ people and places a little better\u2026 At the sole bakery in town, the attendant\
  \ advised me not to order tomato soup, but to buy it in cans in the supermarket.\
  \ It would be cheaper and I could eat it \u201Cfresher\u201D at home. Another day\
  \ I forgot to bring money and noticed it only after I had K\xE4seschnekel and cookies\
  \ to go. I explained it was my last day and asked if my sister could pay for me\
  \ afterwards - she knew us, because we\u2019d always go there. She said yes and\
  \ asked if those cookies were for myself. I said they were. She bear-hugged me and\
  \ told me those were gifts and that my sister didn\u2019t have to pay for anything.\
  \ Unexpected affection\u2026! What about that to keep my heart warm?"
