Text: "In the splendor of the Pacific Ocean between pairs and drifts, in the middle\
  \ of the salt and crystal blue of the turtle bay of the city of Huatulco in the\
  \ state of Oaxaca Mexico I did not expect to meet her, a tall girl with dark hair\
  \ and complexion brunette, the sea breeze was waving my pareo and the sun clouded\
  \ my view it seemed that he wanted to blind my eyes to avoid the encounter, I remember\
  \ having set my body and started walking, my feet were sinking more and more into\
  \ the sand the sea was wrappeding me, first covered my ankles, then my knees, he\
  \ took my waist and went up to my neck, in that moment was when fear invaded me\
  \ despite knowing how to swim my heart was shaking and my lungs screamed for more\
  \ air, I let to feel the sand look down and fall off, hold my breath but my ability\
  \ did not give me, I waved legs and arms but I felt that I couldn't that it was\
  \ not enough and I immersed myself in it, everything is different from the bottom\
  \ I thought, the rays yellows came in and touched my body but I was shaking despite\
  \ being hot I was cold, I was about to close my eyes and give up but one hand took\
  \ me out and brought me to the surface, it was my father, I opened my eyes and there\
  \ I was, I did not expect to find myself, I was lost and in the sea i found myself\
  \ again in that reflection of me. \nIn that trip i found the meaning of life again,\
  \ i realice that sometimes we need to live moments that teach us that life is so\
  \ beautiful and those moments and experiences reminding us that we only have one\
  \ life and we have to live it, we have to do the effort to travel just like the\
  \ quote that says \u201Ctravelling is the only thing you buy that makes you richer\u201D\
  . \nMy experience in Huatulco helps me to fight and not give up. For me traveling\
  \ makes you a better person, helps you grow internally and externally, you learn\
  \ about culture, history and met wonderful people and you have stories to tell and\
  \ share so my advice to you is travel as many as you can."
