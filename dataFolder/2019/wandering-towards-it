Text: "It all began with a faithless hope that I might be contented to just stay awhile\
  \ with some friends in a ski town, though my bags were packed for further travel.\
  \ Perhaps it was knowing the impending dissatisfaction and feeling of being lost\
  \ that would then vault me forward unto my true yearning, that fearless path I still\
  \ held apprehension for and yet desired so dearly. \n\nIt was mid-February as I\
  \ sat in my dear friend\u2019s one room flat in the ski resort town of Winter Park,\
  \ Colorado. I had been there just over a week, having been enticed with the opportunity\
  \ of staying the remainder of the ski season working some job at the resort and\
  \ riding daily, and yet I was hopeless to do anything but continue forward in my\
  \ wandering. \n\nI had taken the train from where I had been living under my parent\u2019\
  s roof in Massachusetts all the way to Colorado despite initially wanting to ford\
  \ westward by way of thumb. With what financial means I had I knew that hitchhiking\
  \ would be the only long term option available to me and I was by no means experienced\
  \ at traveling more than short distances. Still I desired the authenticity of this\
  \ mode of travel, the personal relationships it requires you form, and of course\
  \ the financial practicality of it. \n\nWhat my impending journey demanded of me\
  \ was much more than I had ever dreamed. The only solace for my tortured nerves\
  \ was the fabricated confidence of my ability to figure it all out, that I had the\
  \ necessary ability to overcome the challenges ahead. I had no idea what was to\
  \ come and any attempt to fathom what would be could not even come close to what\
  \ was in store for me. \n\nMy spine tingled with nervous anxiety, though there was\
  \ something else that accompanied the buzz, a deeper spinal vibration, something\
  \ like excitement and yet not quite so easily defined as so. It was in this semi-sure\
  \ manner that I stood next to the highway passing through the small ski town holding\
  \ my humble cardboard sign with \u201CGOING WEST\u201D scrawled across in big block\
  \ letters and no firm destination other than the general geographic direction. I\
  \ hoped for a ride from someone leaving the resort who had come from afar by car\
  \ to ski over the holiday weekend and was now heading back home westwardly, yet\
  \ I knew to appreciate whoever should stop and take me any bit closer to it. It.\
  \ That imagined place of mine I knew to be more than just the working of imagination\
  \ and yet all the same was just as intangible.\n\nNear to an hour passed, lightheartedly\
  \ and with a twang of angst standing by the highway traffic light on the edge of\
  \ town smiling, waving and performing minor dance acts. It was enough to just share\
  \ a cheerful face and hope to make eye contact, any bit of dancing or silliness\
  \ just kept the mood light and my attitude carefree. A lone pickup truck came to\
  \ a stop at the light, my eyes followed the area where the driver\u2019s face should\
  \ be behind the windshield, waiting for any kind of reaction. A hand motioned over\
  \ to me while the face behind the wheel remained indistinguishable. I gathered up\
  \ my belongings, a backpack and travel guitar, and approached the passenger door.\
  \ The lock clicked and I pulled the door open wide.\n\u201CHey man, I can take you\
  \ as far as Denver, hop in.\u201D a cool voice drawled. \nI threw my things into\
  \ the bed of the truck, climbed aboard, and I was off towards \u2018it\u2019."
