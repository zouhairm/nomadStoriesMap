Text: "Sonja, my uncle\u2019s girlfriend told me to go with her to Germany, at the\
  \ beginning it seemed like a bad idea, but as the days passed by and she kept telling\
  \ me about how wonderful the travel could be, I started changing my mind.  I was\
  \ eighteen by then and had never travel somewhere outside Costa Rica. If you have\
  \ had the chance to come to Costa Rica then you know there is a huge difference\
  \ between a Central American country and an European country. \nWe arrive in Munich\
  \ on June 15th, the flight was very long and I felt very lost, just wanted to sleep\
  \ for the next 48 hours. When I finally woke up it was like 6:00 pm, and went downstairs\
  \ and Sonja introduce me to her family, her mom Monika, her dad Frank and her brother\
  \ Matthias. They live in a Bavarian town called F\xFCrstenfeldbruck, located 32\
  \ kilometers west of Munich.  Their house had two floors and outside was covered\
  \ almost completely with a climbing plant, it looked beautiful. \nF\xFCrstenfeldbruck\
  \ looked old and new at the same time, at last to me. I loved how everyone was riding\
  \ a bike, sitting outside on those caf\xE9\u2019s where the chairs never stand even\
  \ in the ground, eating some gelato or just drinking coffee or tea. The smell was\
  \ perfect, in every new corner you smelled something delicious and I wanted to try\
  \ it all. The bread, the cheese and the chocolate\u2026 God the chocolate. There\
  \ were some foods I didn\u2019t like while in Germany though, for example the mazapan,\
  \ is supposed to be sweet but I didn\u2019t it taste sweet to me, the brezel, that\
  \ it looks like a huge pretzel but I wasn\u2019t very into it, and the wurst or\
  \ sausages, no matter what time of the day it was they could eat a sausage and of\
  \ course drink a beer. \nF\xFCrstenfeldbruck has many things to offer, many things\
  \ to see and many to eat. I went to the Zisterzienserkloster Furstenfeld that is\
  \ an ancient monastery very interesting and beautiful. Also went to the Museum F\xFC\
  rstenfelbruck in Kloster and to the Fuerstenfeld Abbey among others places.\nMy\
  \ trip didn\u2019t focus just on that part of Germany; I had the opportunity to\
  \ visit Berlin as well and stayed there for 22 days. I was very surprise that the\
  \ city had so much green in it. There where trees all over the city and the combination\
  \ of huge gray buildings and trees completely amaze me.  This city is fabulous,\
  \ is such an intercultural city and yet so conservative. It is fascinating how the\
  \ history of this city remains in every corner and how the future days are making\
  \ its way to her bringing new colors and new cultures. This is definitely a must\
  \ watch city, I enjoyed myself so much in there, met so many nice and interesting\
  \ people and watch so many great things that my memory has a complete photo album\
  \ named: Berlin unexpected.  \nIn the time Sonja and I were there I had to help\
  \ her pack, she was moving. She used to live in Berlin, but now, she was moving\
  \ to Costa Rica. We had to sell some of her stuff so we went to the flea market\
  \ at Boxhagener Platz, and that was just mind blowing. There were artists, handicrafts\
  \ products and people selling used goods. We went there three days in a row, and\
  \ I got to meet many people with many interesting stories. It was a complete pleasure.\
  \ \nBefore we went back to F\xFCrstenfeldbruck, Sonja took me to know some places;\
  \ the one that I remember the most is Neuschwanstein Castle in southwest Bavaria\
  \ and I just have to say that the pictures you see of this place don\u2019t make\
  \ justice to what you see in person while being there.  Extraordinary.  If you haven\u2019\
  t been there, I recommend you to ASAP, you won\u2019t regret it.  Germany was my\
  \ first trip, and this is just a few words of what I would really like to say about\
  \ it, what I had the chance to know about that country and about myself while being\
  \ there was perfect. An experience I didn\u2019t expect to find."
