Text: "Dearest Vincent,\n\nI visited your museum a few days ago. That must feel strange,\
  \ huh? Did you ever think you would have a museum to your name? Did you ever doubt\
  \ it? I wonder if you can see us all, piling in and out of that place everyday.\n\
  \nDo you feel honoured? Do you feel satisfied? Has the madness finally closed its\
  \ eyes and laid to rest? I wonder if it ever really does. Are you happy now? As\
  \ you lay up there with the stars you so often dreamt of.\n\nI spent much of this\
  \ trip with you in my heart. I walked the streets of your country feeling the same\
  \ enchantment you must have as a boy. I braced the same cold, slipped on the same\
  \ ice, fell in love with the same canals. I sit in coffee shops and write letters\
  \ to my dearest, just as you had all those lifetimes ago. And though the cafes have\
  \ changed, I imagine the foundations remain the same (do the bones of cities ever\
  \ really change?).\n\nI understand it here, the need to create. Perhaps I thought\
  \ I understood it before, though I imagine I was wrong. But here; I understand.\
  \ There is magic in Amsterdam. It flows through the balconies and the streams, and\
  \ all the pretty magic places in between. It does not tickle you; no, it is not\
  \ so subtle. It jerks you, provokes you, dares you. It tempts you to succumb. \"\
  Make magic\", it pleas. \"Make art\". And with a voice like that, how can you disagree?\n\
  \nSo here I am. Sitting in a cafe whose name I cannot pronounce; writing letters\
  \ to you. The heart of this city is inspiration enough to flow my literary juices.\
  \ The pen moves on its own accord, I need not compel it to.\n\nI am happy with my\
  \ decisions in this life. They have shifted and conspired and led me here; led me\
  \ to you. I hope you're happy with your choices too.\n\nEver Yours, \n - Harleen"
