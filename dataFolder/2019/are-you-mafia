Text: "In Thailand, shuttles are a cheap way to move around between cities. A friend\
  \ and I decided to take a shuttle to Krabi. They gave us all a small sticker and\
  \ said to wait.\n\nA van pulls up. We get on. A few minutes later, Deb looks down\
  \ and says to me, \u201CMy sticker is gone.\u201D It\u2019s fine, they barely stick\
  \ on anything. I am sure it is okay.\n\nRight then, the driver looks at her in the\
  \ rearview mirror,  \u201CWhere is your sticker?\u201D He is mad. \u201CI just had\
  \ it, it must have fallen off.\u201D He shakes his head. He says, \u201CAre you\
  \ mafia?\u201D Huh? No, we are just two nice American girls trying to go to the\
  \ beach. \u201CNo sir, we are not mafia. We paid for our tickets.\u201D He stops\
  \ and pulls over on the side of the road.\n\n\u201CGet out of the van!\u201D He\
  \ is screaming. We look around at the other passengers who are sitting in silence\
  \ with stunned looks on their faces. Now, I understand his anger if he thinks some\
  \ tourists are trying to scam him and get a free ride. But the level of his anger\
  \ happened too quickly for it to be related only to this incident. It must be coming\
  \ from something deeper and we just triggered it to come alive.\n\nHis anger is\
  \ growing and you can tell everyone in the shuttle is legitimately scared. She pulls\
  \ out 400 baht and hands it to him even though she already paid. We have no service\
  \ here, it is getting dark, and there is no town in sight. \n\n\u201CHere, I will\
  \ pay again, please let us stay.\u201D He takes the money and throws it at her.\
  \ He steps out, walks to the side of the van, slides open the door. He says, \u201C\
  Get out of the van or I will drive you to an alley, pull out my gun, and shoot you.\u201D\
  \ Okay, we will get out of van. \n\nWe grab our stuff and get out. Everyone is sitting\
  \ there in shock. Then, a guy in the back shouts. \u201CShe paid. If she gets off\
  \ the bus, I am getting off too.\u201D\n\nHe climbs to the front of the van, gets\
  \ out, and stands by us on the side of the road. The others in the shuttle start\
  \ climbing out as well until we are all standing outside. The guy from the back\
  \ continues to advocate for us. He is says it is all of us, or none of us. The driver\
  \ stands there. Likely thinking about how this might not look good if his entire\
  \ shuttle is empty when he arrives at our destination. We all end up getting back\
  \ in the van and ride the rest of the way in silence.\n\nI spent the last hour of\
  \ the ride feeling so much love for this stranger. He didn\u2019t know us and could\
  \ have easily let us be left on the side of the road so that he could enjoy his\
  \ holiday. Instead, he took the chance of being left on the side of the road himself,\
  \ in order to try and help us. No one else said anything, although they did follow\
  \ him. Without his voice, we would have been stranded alone while they continued\
  \ along on their journey.\n\nThis made me question how many times I had stayed quiet\
  \ when I should have said something. I am sure others in the van wanted to help\
  \ but were too scared to make this driver more angry. There are times when it may\
  \ feel like no one cares about us. But when it comes down to it, people really are\
  \ willing to help each other. Sometimes, all it takes is one person to be the voice\
  \ and often others will follow. From that moment on, I told myself I would strive\
  \ to be this voice.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, we are all in this together and\
  \ need to stand by each other. While I would prefer to never be in this situation\
  \ again, I am thankful for the reminder of the power of human connection. And if\
  \ you are ever in Thailand, do NOT lose your sticker."
