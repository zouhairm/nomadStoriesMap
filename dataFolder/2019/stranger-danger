Text: "When I was young, my parents always told me: \"Don't to talk to strangers!\"\
  .\nBut, the more I've traveled, I've realized that, that sentence comes with a lot\
  \ of terms and conditions.\nThis is the story about how a leap into the unknown\
  \ helped me become fluent in Spanish, and conquer my fear of talking to strangers.\n\
  \nOne day, I decided to take a step out of my comfort zone and move to Argentina.\n\
  But, when I first arrived in Argentina, I was not at all ready for the amount of\
  \ strangers I'd be speaking to everyday, and on top of that, I was not at all confident\
  \ in my Spanish skills. So, for the first few weeks, I was so scared of being judged\
  \ (by strangers) for my accent that I would barely even speak (I would nod my head,\
  \ and point A LOT). \n\nAfter a while, I decided that if I could move to another\
  \ country, I could conquer this fear. So, I decided to start saying small sentences\
  \ each day to work up my courage. And, eventually (after almost a month), I worked\
  \ up enough courage to start having small conversations in Spanish with random strangers.\
  \ Those conversations started getting longer and longer every day. And, before I\
  \ knew it, I was having full conversations in Spanish with strangers. And, now,\
  \ I can actually say that I can fluently speak Spanish, and I am no longer afraid\
  \ to speak to strangers.\n\nIt was definitely not a quick and easy process because\
  \ I had to conquer two fears at the same time (speaking to strangers, and being\
  \ judged for my accent). But, it was definitely worth it because now, I can say\
  \ that taking that step out of my comfort zone to live in another country, made\
  \ me start to gain confidence, let my fears go, and start speaking to strangers\
  \ (in a foreign language!).\n\nIn conclusion, stepping out of my comfort zone to\
  \ live in a foreign country taught me that the unknown can be really exciting; that's\
  \ why I chose to write about this theme. Taking the leap into the unknown and living\
  \ in a foreign country changed my life in so many ways. It helped me conquer my\
  \ fears, and gave me a lot more self-confidence. \nAnd, I believe that a big part\
  \ of traveling is doing things you wouldn't do in your own country because sometimes\
  \ it takes stepping out of your comfort zone to really change your life and learn\
  \ valuable lessons.\nSometimes the only way to conquer a fear is to take a leap\
  \ into the unknown because the unknown is where you truly try your hardest!"
