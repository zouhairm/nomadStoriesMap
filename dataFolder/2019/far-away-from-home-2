Text: "I have always dreamed of traveling but I had to push those dreams aside while\
  \ growing up and only had the passion of bringing it back to life when I joined\
  \ a long drive with my family to a remote industrial town, west of Abu Dhabi \u2013\
  \ Al Ruwais.  A lot of people would say that Al Ruwais is just an extension of the\
  \ UAE\u2019s capital city Abu Dhabi, and a border to Saudi Arabia, but I never expected\
  \ to notice changes between living life in a huge city compared to living life in\
  \ a small town the moment I set foot there.\n\nIt was indeed an enriching experience\
  \ to go for a trip 5 hours away from where I lived in the city to a town which was\
  \ once nothing but a pile of red desert sand.  The area houses families whose family\
  \ members were assigned to work there, mostly in the oil industry. Few facilities\
  \ such as malls, hotels, travel agencies, schools, central parks, and man-made beaches\
  \ have been built to cater to the individual social needs of those living there,\
  \ especially the children. I even recount my cousin mention to me the number of\
  \ students in his class; he told me there were only 15 of them, and I realized just\
  \ how equally important it is for them to be able to spend time outside the corners\
  \ of their homes.\n\nOnce during a Christmas get together with our family, my cousins\
  \ showed us around the area.  To my north was the only mall and just a few minutes\u2019\
  \ drive away was a huge mess hall where we had our buffet dinner. The mess hall's\
  \ exactly what restaurants looked like in hotels, except that this one wasn't in\
  \ a hotel. Instead, it was an entire building to have meals. It felt different to\
  \ be in the midst of people who looked like they knew almost everyone. Maybe the\
  \ size of Al Ruwais was one factor why everyone were much more open with each other,\
  \ and I thought to myself\u2013 when people have no choice and enough freedom to\
  \ move out and about, they by all means adapt to their environment and make the\
  \ most of it.\n\nI also had a chat conversation with a man who works in Al Ruwais\
  \ and asked him how he felt about living far away from his hometown in South Korea\
  \ only to work in Al Ruwais. He told me he was often bored and only have the chance\
  \ to hop on the bus and indulge himself in a 2-hour long drive to Abu Dhabi once\
  \ a week.  Life for him meant work and home every single day, but once in a while\
  \ he told me he goes out for walks.  Despite Al Ruwais termed as a remote desert,\
  \ I don't think so someone would say 'no' to long walks in a calm atmosphere where\
  \ the hustle and bustle of city life isn't much of a distraction.\n\nAl Ruwais may\
  \ be a tiny town within a city but it holds so much in terms of business for the\
  \ UAE.  My yearly trips there have always been one that\u2019d spark pleasure in\
  \ me, but most of all, those short trips led me to bringing back my travel dreams\
  \ to life. If I had the ultimate joy of finding out how people lived in an unknown\
  \ part of this country, how much more would I be amused when I get to witness a\
  \ complete change of environment?  Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to find\
  \ such immense happiness in a small town far away from home."
