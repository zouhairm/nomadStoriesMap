Text: "Growing up, I was always content with the life in front of me - establishing\
  \ myself close to home, staying near all those I cared about so much. In 2014, I\
  \ had the incredible opportunity to escape the traditional lifestyle and experience\
  \ life on an all-inclusive resort in Punta Cana. From learning about the local culture\
  \ and tradtitions to jumping at the chance for expeditions that I had only dreamt\
  \ of in the past... every day was an adventure unlike any other.\n\nSnorkeling in\
  \ the ocean was always on the bucket list, but it took local experts encouraging\
  \ me to finally take that step into the unknown. To experience the colors and atmosphere\
  \ that most only see on television from the comfort of their own homes... became\
  \ an instant addiction. I realized that there was so much more to life than the\
  \ \u201Cstability\u201D of home owning and settling down, and began to pursue adventure\
  \ accordingly. After that, I found myself anywhere from the Bahamas to Canada, even\
  \ if it meant extensive hours of driving to be able to soak it all in.\n\nMy hope\
  \ is to broaden my horizons beyond North America to the rest of the world, and to\
  \ document it in a manner that others can not only share in - but feel that they\
  \ are there in the moment themselves."
