Text: "That Lisbon is beautiful, there is no doubt about it, that at Christmas it\
  \ looks bright, radiant and plethoric. And that these special dates change the heartbeat\
  \ of almost any Christian city we already know.\n\nThat the capital has a lot to\
  \ offer, is a reality; Heritage, scars of earthquakes, a rich cultural life, teleporting\
  \ streets in time, curious shops, art galleries, delicious cuisine ... without a\
  \ doubt a highly recommended destination.\n\nI guess maybe not everyone finds beauty\
  \ on the decadent side of the city. But for me that broken soul, that \u201Clisboeta\u201D\
  \ sadness, ... the chipping, alleyways, the castings in the sun ... give the city\
  \ an essence, a personality so unique and special that I fall in love. \n\nThere\
  \ we spent a New Year's Eve surrounded by a radiant light as Atlantic as that of\
  \ my beloved C\xE1diz, up and down slopes and gossiping the city on foot and from\
  \ some nocturnal and romantic tram ...\n\nI remember that on the night of December\
  \ 31 we had dinner relatively early and we did it in a tiny, simple and recommended\
  \ local bar. I could not miss the cod, rice, green wine or homemade sweets ... all\
  \ in a very familiar atmosphere and with a very funny waiter.\n\nAfter the rich\
  \ dinner we went to the Plaza del Comercio where they had installed a stage. The\
  \ decorated place began to fill with music and people waiting for midnight. And\
  \ there we stayed a while to take the pulse of the environment. And what a weak\
  \ pulse. Ay \"om\xE1\" with how beautiful the \u201Cfados\u201D are ... Ay \"om\xE1\
  \" ... with what we like the languid voice of the great Dulce Pontes, ... but oh\
  \ \"om\xE1\" the little that the \u201Cfados\u201D hit for a happy night of end\
  \ year. Deep \u201Cfados\u201D are torn songs that speak of nostalgia, melancholy,\
  \ and above all of fatalism and frustration ... It's a very \u201Clisboeta\u201D\
  \ soundtrack perfect for that chipped beauty that seduces me ... but perhaps sad\
  \ and sleepy as a lullaby to start the new year ...\n\n\nOf course, the boy on stage\
  \ had neither the voice, nor the art, nor the elegance of the sweet singer ... we\
  \ gave him some \u201Cfados\u201D as an opportunity ... but considering the much\
  \ languor of the matter, the great \u201Csodade\u2019 that was breathed and the\
  \ pain of the feet of the tourist long day, ... we decided to return to the hotel\
  \ before falling asleep or cutting our veins with the same sadness.\n\nSurely there\
  \ were other places, bars and places with more atmosphere, but we were already in\
  \ \"Cinderella On\" mode and we left before they stopped public transport and it\
  \ was impossible mission to take a taxi. \n\nWe arrived just in time to bid farewell\
  \ to the year. In the absence of the classic grapes we manage with some raspberries,\
  \ we toast and from the heights we enjoy the fireworks that that special night flew\
  \ over the Lisbon shore of the Tagus. \n\nNow every time I hear the first notes\
  \ of a sad \u201Cfado\u201D ... I smile with the many traveling memories that music\
  \ is able to bring to our memory."
