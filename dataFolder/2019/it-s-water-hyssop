Text: "When searching for a reasonably priced hotel in Hong Kong, I found a place\
  \ that promoted itself as close to the Hong Kong Wetland Park.  I had not heard\
  \ of the area or the park.  I chose a hotel closer to the city center and did not\
  \ have time to visit the park on that trip.  However, I knew that I would have to\
  \ return to see what the Wetland Park was about.  On my return trip, seeing the\
  \ park was my top priority.  I was amazed by the size.   The majority of the trees,\
  \ bushes, grasses, and flowers were labeled, and explanations as to their food and\
  \ medicinal purposes educated me about traditional Chinese cuisine and uses for\
  \ plants.  It was an arboretum and wildlife refuge in one big, peaceful, quiet place.\
  \  Fellow visitors were young and old, and many photography and wildlife enthusiasts\
  \ arrived with gear to capture the beauty of the birds.\n\nThe spoonbill is a mascot\
  \ of the park.  At the first two hides I visited, I failed to see them.  At the\
  \ third hide, I saw a lifetime\u2019s worth of the special creatures.  It is so\
  \ wonderful to see animals living outside of human control.  Some of the migratory\
  \ birds were on their long journeys to different continents.  I did not see the\
  \ mudskippers.  I also missed a wing holding the aquariums.  I will see those on\
  \ my return visit.  This is a park to visit at various times of the year.  Animals\
  \ arrive during different seasons.  Flowers and fruit are seen during different\
  \ times as well.  The butterflies that I did see were brilliant and inspiring. \
  \ There is no greenhouse to keep them in. The park is their home.\n\nThe park advertised\
  \ on the double decker buses rolling through the crowded streets of the city center.\
  \  When asking local people if they had visited, I only spoke with one person who\
  \ had gone, but had not seen the whole thing.\n\nOne of the many plants that I learned\
  \ about is a humble little water plant called water hyssop. Years ago, I had bought\
  \ a bag of it at an Asian supermarket in my home state of California.  There was\
  \ no scientific or common name listed in the grocery store, only the name in Vietnamese\
  \ and Chinese.    After nearly twenty years, I have a name for the bitter little\
  \ plant: water hyssop (Bacopa monnieri).  I learned from my visit that it grows\
  \ in water.  It was a breakthrough moment for me.  It was the highlight of the trip,\
  \ to get to know something better.\n\nI hope to return to Hong Kong and the Wetland\
  \ Park in the coming year.  The experience made me a more fulfilled person.  I have\
  \ a little water hyssop plant growing near my kitchen window.  It makes me happy\
  \ and reminds me of the joy of travel and learning."
