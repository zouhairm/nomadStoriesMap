Text: "In the middle of nowhere in a small Italian city, we lost our way to a train\
  \ station. On a poorly lighted street, no soul could help us out. At such an hour\
  \ the shops were closed, and in the only grocery we found, a shop-woman didn\u2019\
  t speak English or German, neither had we done Italian. So, we left emptyhanded.\n\
  Outside under the only working lamp, my friend took out a small dictionary from\
  \ her backpack. \n-\tYou should have done this earlier when we were in there. \u2013\
  \ I was mad.\n-\tWould it make any difference, we couldn\u2019t understand her anyway,\
  \ right?\n-\tDamn, right. We could make her draw the way for us at least. \nWe both\
  \ were exchange students traveling through Europe for a week but for a first time\
  \ trapped in a city where no people spoke English or German. \nShe found the word\
  \ \u201Cstation\u201D in Italian and we headed back to a grocery. The short old\
  \ man with a bike suddenly appeared in front of us while the shop-woman closed the\
  \ grocery and vanished.\n-\tBeing out at this late hour is dangerous \u2013 he said.\
  \ His closes were old but tidy; he looked like a wizard wearing a hat and a long\
  \ jacket. A modern wizard if you\u2019ll consider the bike. \u2013 What you\u2019\
  re looking for? \n-\tTrain station, sir. Missing our train would be a disaster,\
  \ yet we have all chances to stay here tonight \u2013 I answered and realized I\
  \ understood him mostly. He filled in his English sentences with Italian words he\
  \ didn\u2019t remember. \nThe man smiled again and promised to show the road. We\
  \ had no choice but to follow him to the next road. He turned to a completely dark\
  \ alley, I stopped.\n-\tIt\u2019d be foolish of us following you there. Just show\
  \ us the direction, please. The different one with lights.\n-\tWhere are you from?\
  \ \u2013 asked the old wizard.\n-\tShe is from Russia, I\u2019m from Ukraine, we\
  \ both live in Germany now. \n-\tI used to be a sailor and have been to Odessa in\
  \ Ukraine and Krasnodar in Russia. \u2013 He turned his bike to a broad road with\
  \ good light. \u2013 I\u2019ll bring you to the train station. Actually, I stopped\
  \ because I heard you speaking Ukrainian. I still remember a couple of words. \n\
  We went to the end of the broad road and turned to an alley where buildings stood\
  \ close shoulder to shoulder looking down at us. We felt small. The door ripped\
  \ behind.\n-\tDon\u2019t you mind if we hurry? The train will leave at midnight\
  \ \u2013 my friend said.\n-\tNot at all. We have 10 minutes\u2019 walk ahead of\
  \ us \u2013 said an old man. \u2013 What have you seen here?\n-\tA couple of monuments\
  \ and churches. We liked the Nicolaus church the most. \u2013 I said.\n-\tI\u2019\
  m named after the Nicolaus from this church. He saved me and my family many times\
  \ \u2013 An old man described how he worked, how met a good girl and married her,\
  \ now he had a son and a daughter living somewhere else, his wife passed away, and\
  \ now he rode a bike from time to time to amuse himself. \u2013 I\u2019ll treat\
  \ you coffee, girls. \u2013 He said suddenly. \nWe refused. Wouldn\u2019t it be\
  \ awkward to drink at night with an old stranger? He insisted, we refused again\
  \ and almost felt his loneliness. So we agreed. \nSitting at a night caf\xE9 next\
  \ to the train station we felt somehow safe. The coffee was black, no milk, no sugar.\
  \ He ordered. \n-\tOne has to fasten a bike in this small city if you want to find\
  \ it where you\u2019ve left it. Are you done with a coffee?\nWe nodded. He smiled\
  \ and added:\n-\tI\u2019m happy now because you wouldn\u2019t fall asleep now and\
  \ get robbed. Bless you and don\u2019t sleep on a train. \nWe\u2019ve taken a picture\
  \ together, and he vanished in a mist carrying his bike.\nWe didn\u2019t get asleep\
  \ that night and came home safe. The other week my friend from Russia traveled to\
  \ Florence and got robbed, the camera with our picture now was lost forever. Still,\
  \ I remember Nicolaus and hope he\u2019s doing well."
