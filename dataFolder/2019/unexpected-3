Text: "My hotel came equipped with flickering lights, dark narrow corridors and a\
  \ suffocating room absent of windows. I was completely alone. It felt like the opening\
  \ scene of a Hitchcock film, Psycho sprung to mind. But it was just one night. Tomorrow\
  \ I would take the short leap from Colombia into Ecuador. \n\nAs morning light rose,\
  \ I made my way to the border. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but I was excited\
  \ to explore Ecuador. My excitement soon wavered:\n\n\u201CGood luck,\u201D my taxi\
  \ driver said wistfully.  \n\nAs I fumbled for my bags, my eyes settled on a sea\
  \ of strangers, washed over the pavement like a vast ocean, their faces glum, tired,\
  \ desperate. The air was oppressive, smothered with sadness and confusion. As I\
  \ searched for the end of the line, I realised these people had been camping out\
  \ here: setting up shelters; stringing up hammocks; sleeping in between their suitcases.\
  \ I reluctantly remembered how heavy the rain was last night.  \n\nMy eyes flickered\
  \ up and down the line, trying to find other travellers for a sense of security.\
  \ There were none. Despite lessons taken earlier in my trip, my Spanish was basic;\
  \ I felt alone again.\n\n1pm. After 4 hours of sitting in the stifling Colombian\
  \ heat, armed with Google translate, I finally plucked up the courage to ask a girl\
  \ beside me what was going on. As she answered, she smiled, but her eyes told a\
  \ different story. \n\nThrough broken English and Spanish and an ongoing game of\
  \ charades, I learnt that most of the people in the queue were Venezuelans, caught\
  \ in the cataclysmic spiral of their home country\u2019s\u2019 growing political\
  \ discontent. Maria was barely 19 years old. As the only one in her family able\
  \ to work, she was responsible for sending money back to her elderly mother and\
  \ son. This was her first time away from home and away from her little boy; he was\
  \ just two years old. She was not there out of choice like me, but out of necessity.\n\
  \n7pm. As our weary feet shuffled along the cracked pavement, we snaked around to\
  \ another line, only to be further than our original starting point. The sun began\
  \ to fade; darkness encased us. Ten hours had passed, and we were still no closer\
  \ to the border. We were cold, hungry, exhausted. But despite the relentlessness\
  \ of it all, the language barriers and the variable events that had brought us there,\
  \ we found solace in one another. We laughed at our cross-lingual attempts to convey\
  \ our thoughts, we danced, we cried, and we huddled together as the cold set in.\
  \ We had formed an alliance; a friendship. \n\n11pm. We had made it to Colombian\
  \ immigration. Now cocooned together in our blankets, we waited patiently to get\
  \ our exit stamps. It was a mini victory. We were almost there. \n\n\u201CVAMOS\
  \ VAMOS\u2019\u201D\n\nThe guard\u2019s overpowering authority hit us like a tidal\
  \ wave. Tired and disorientated, we were confused by his urgency. Then it dawned\
  \ on us; we were being separated. There was a different line for British Citizens,\
  \ one that would get me over the border in just fifteen minutes.\n\nI refused. I\
  \ felt unexpectedly bound to Maria. We were in this together.\n\n2am. As the exit\
  \ stamp plastered my passport, I breathed a sigh of relief. I searched for Maria\
  \ to share in our triumph but when our eyes locked, all I could see was despair.\
  \ With the remaining pesos on her Colombian phone-card and before entering Ecuador,\
  \ she had called her son to say goodbye.\n\n\u201CTe Amo\u201D\n\nShe repeated these\
  \ words through the breaks of her tears, but they offered no reassurance, met only\
  \ with desperate cries for her to return home. \n\n4.30am. We were in Ecuador. Slumped\
  \ on the cripplingly cold floor of the bus station, we would soon part ways. I felt\
  \ a sense of imminent loss. I had known Maria for less than 24 hours and yet those\
  \ 24 hours had created an unexpected bond.\n\nAs we said goodbye, I wondered what\
  \ was next for my friend. For me, the last 24 hours had been the hardest part of\
  \ my journey, but for Maria, it was only just the beginning."
