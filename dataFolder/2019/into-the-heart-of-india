Text: "The noisy horns mixed with the sound of the people shouting around the street,\
  \ the cows, the dogs, the people sitting on the street and the tuk tuk's, all making\
  \ it hard for you to walk through the streets of Delhi.You are lucky if, on your\
  \ way, you don't step on someone or get interfered with a cow trying to make it's\
  \ way around the city.  There is a strange smell covering the whole city, which\
  \ can be identified as the remains of the garbage stored in the sidewalks, or the\
  \ smell of the food stops which usually serve somozas, typical Indian food. \nDelhi\
  \ is known as being one of the most contaminated cities in the world, and this can\
  \ be proved by the fog that covers every part of the sky, avoinding you to see any\
  \ part of sun or blue sky. People live by there own rules, there are no street lanes,\
  \ nobody respects traffic lights, there are no trash cans, they use the street as\
  \ a bathroom and they don't even use toilet paper! But besides this, Indian people\
  \ are generous, always looking to find the way to help you out and they are friendly\
  \ people who want to get to know you. Every structure that needs to work for a city,\
  \ does not work for Delhi. However, the society is so patient and kind, that they\
  \ make it work."
