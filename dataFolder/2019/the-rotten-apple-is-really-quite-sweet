Text: "On 22 Friday of February, 2019, at approximately 12.35pm Eastern Standard Time;\
  \ I departed Kingsford-Smith airport in Sydney, on a flight destined for Los Angeles\
  \ (LA) airport, also known as \u201CLAX.\u201D My final destination was to be John\
  \ F. Kennedy airport in New York, although it is mandatory to enter New York via\
  \ LAX, which did not phase me one bit as I was eager to leisurely walk from Terminal\
  \ B for 10 minutes, to eventually arrive at Terminal 2 for connecting flight.\n\n\
  The entire purpose of my expedition was to persist in my progressive learning of\
  \ the Hip Hop street dance style named K.R.U.M.P (\u201CKingdom Radical Uplifting\
  \ Mighty Praise) as there were workshops from three of definitive masters of the\
  \ dance style; of which I have been participating in, performing to various audiences\
  \ for, and occasionally Teaching for 10 years. Little did I know, I was to be one\
  \ of three people chosen by USA Customs Officer at LAX, to be escorted to a seperate\
  \ area for bag searching and questioning. I was not concerned whatsoever, having\
  \ travelled to the USA before; however, when it was my turn to have my bags searched\
  \ and be questioned by the Officer, I was compelled to share with him that was on\
  \ a sightseeing holiday, but also to give him a short historical background on Krump:\
  \ the fact that it was created in LA as way to resolve conflicts in troubled neighbourhoods,\
  \ and was growing faster worldwide, than any other Hip Hop dance style. Once he\
  \ had heard my true intentions for the journey, he sent me on my way, and as I walked\
  \ towards the Security screening section of the airport; I thought to myself: \u201C\
  This is not going to be an ordinary trip!\u201D After all, I have always known that\
  \ travel \u201Cbroadens the mind,\u201D which I has been re-emphasised to me over\
  \ my short few years of travel.\n\nArriving at JFK airport at approximately 6pm,\
  \ I was not only tired but also disorientated - I didn\u2019t really know where\
  \ to catch the train to, in order to get to my hotel in Queensbridge! I had done\
  \ my usual research and planning, however, I was quite confused by the fact that\
  \ I was staying near Long Island for two weeks, and there was a subway station area\
  \ known as \u201CLong Island railroad,\u201D it was only once I began asking some\
  \ of the very helpful Airport train staff how to get to 21st Queensbridge station,\
  \ that I was carefully directed to the correct area. My confusion and disorientation\
  \ was reassured by their generosity and compassion...which became the binding element\
  \ of my \u2018nomadic sightseeing\u2019 as I like to call it, in and around New\
  \ York. Surprisingly, I found that whether I was in the centre of New York or in\
  \ Harlem, all the people who I asked help or assistance from, were extremely sympathetic\
  \ and kind. And to think, all these misconceptions and negative stereotypes regarding\
  \ New York City residents as being moody, miserable, aggressive, bitter, etc; it\
  \ was all completely inaccurate and inappropriate.\n\nAlthough, my fondest memory\
  \ occurred when strolling in and around Harlem and was taking photos using my camera\
  \ phone; I innocently came across a piece of Graffiti art on an old blue door in\
  \ a backstreet. The following words were spray painted in white: \u201CToo many\
  \ humans & not enuf souls,\u201D I was blown away. This was in Harlem. All the countless\
  \ years of reading Philosophical quotes and classical texts from great writers such\
  \ as Lao Tzu, Confucius, Miyamoto Musashi and Socrates to name a few; I discovered\
  \ probably the most profound and simplistic expression relating to our existence\
  \ on this planet. It was not to my surprise that it was on a street away from the\
  \ centre of the town, as I have experienced this many times before. The philosophical\
  \ content was deep, despite the grammatical and spelling errors. It did not matter\
  \ to me - the message was crystal clear and quite simple. I pondered on the subway\
  \ train back to Queensbridge: \u201CWhat is the true purpose of life?\u201D I have\
  \ always personally seeked the more altruistic elements of life, and New York reminded\
  \ me of these truths in life."
