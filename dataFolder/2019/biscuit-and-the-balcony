Text: "It was 10 minutes past 10. Uncle Decosta was still finishing last few sips\
  \ of his King\u2019s beer while John fixing his bed was anxious about his cricket\
  \ match next day at the Oval. Every CharPai was taking the load of some or the other\
  \ Madgaon fellow except the one near the balcony whose load was still in transit\
  \ from Borivali.\nNext Morning , black scooter wala dashed into an old gujarati\
  \ lady crossing the junction, waking up Pedro, who was almost signing the possession\
  \ papers of his 4 BHK flat in Cuffe Parade in his sleep. Not bothering about the\
  \ chaos at the junction, disappointed Pedro hurriedly went down to roll up the shutters\
  \ of Kyani & Co.\nMargaokars and Pondakars were queuing up the narrow corridors\
  \ of the courtyard making comments on their respective football clubs. While everyone\
  \ was worried about bathing before the water runs out, Savio was still in bed. He\
  \ would never get a sound sleep on land. Young Shipman would keep gazing the ceiling\
  \ washed in Metro Cinemas blood red neon light. Nostalgic about the chilled rose\
  \ sherbat, that would be his favorite on the ship.\nWalking on the sidewalk on a\
  \ long avenue from Victoria Terminus, Joseph remembers what Aunty Ruby said ,\u201D\
  \ These policemen would catch you even if you cross roads\u201D, listening her voice,\
  \ also reminded him that the building where the club is was supposed to be is a\
  \ tall building turning with the road, and there is a music store named after some\
  \ Furtado uncle. He chose subway over crossing roads. He got lost. He kept speeding\
  \ straight where he could see some light falling on the side walls. As soon as he\
  \ came out, he was welcomed by a huge Bollywood Actor posing on the banner of Metro\
  \ Cinema. This time he didn\u2019t care about using the dingy subway, and just ran\
  \ crossing signal after signal till he reached Furtados. His trunk was less of clothes\
  \ and more of masalas for his everyday fish curry. He knew that Bombay Duck wasn\u2019\
  t as delicious as Goan Rawas.\nJoseph Mascarenas takes every step with the idea\
  \ of the twisted candy like staircase or even the building coming down. Why do we\
  \ leave Goa for this paralyzed building, whyyy ? The retrofitted stainless steel\
  \ railing helped him to reach the first floor.\nSavio blocks his way to ask, \u201C\
  Hey, You play guitar at Darios, right ? I think I have seen you performing there,\
  \ I come there often.\u201D Joseph felt like he has finally back home.\nNancy, the\
  \ cat was seated on the balcony railing for John to come with some relaxing news,\
  \ or else she would have to go back to Ponda and share food with Jimmy. Meanwhile,\
  \ Savio and Joseph started jamming over few jazz classics.\nExhausted smile on John\u2019\
  s face, gave a hint to Pedro that it was the time for some Bun Maska and Chai. He\
  \ called Savio to be a part of the victory treat. Savio missed his reading session\
  \ across the road and took Mascarenas as well for some free fresh buns. John gave\
  \ some crucial insights of the match. His actions with the bat even made Irani Uncle\
  \ believe in this young Mapusa boy. Savio gazing at John\u2019s shots never realized\
  \ that the dipped biscuit fell into the chai and so did the first floor balcony\
  \ on to the ground. Jer Mahal was only a dream to be living in...\nThe cat went\
  \ missing !"
