Text: "It\u2019s the Fifa World Cup Final and I'm rushing through the cobblestone\
  \ streets of Lisbon. Only thirty minutes till the kick-off and, as a standard Brazilian,\
  \ I was eager to savour the emotions of a proper World Cup final in the middle of\
  \ the European fans, after all it was France vs Croatia.  I had only arrived from\
  \ the airport, so I left my luggage in the room and went back to the front desk.\
  \ The hotel clerk told me there was a huge screen at Pra\xE7a do Com\xE9rcio, the\
  \ city\u2019s most emblematic square. The thing is: the place was twenty minutes\
  \ away \u2013 in a fast pace \u2013 and I still wanted to buy a bottle of vinho\
  \ verde \u2013 a kind of fizzy white wine, very popular in Portugal. \nI left the\
  \ hotel at Avenida da Liberdade and kept moving towards the Rossio. It wasn\u2019\
  t my first time in the Portuguese capital, but the lively atmosphere of Lisbon always\
  \ delivered a whole new experience, and this time it was even better cause I shared\
  \ the streets with tons of football fans chanting anthems and wearing national jerseys.\
  \ So, as I approached the square, I found a small wine shop and quickly made my\
  \ way in. \nSpeaking Portuguese, I asked for a bottle of vinho verde, and I specified\
  \ the brand. The salesman was a tall and serious gentleman close to his 70\u2019\
  s. He instantly frowned upon my request, not saying a word. I repeated, slowly,\
  \ but I had the same response. I started to get a bit irritated, but then I realised\
  \ I needed to restart the whole conversation. \u201CPlease, I\u2019d like a bottle\
  \ of green wine. What would suggest, sir?\u201D. \nThe password had been accepted.\
  \ Mr. Almeida, as he introduced himself, grabbed me by the arm and proudly presented\
  \ some of his best bottles. He started by saying that the one I initially ordered\
  \ was worse than cat\u2019s piss and Brazilians wasted their money drinking that.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but laugh, as he maintained the phlegmatic expression. In\
  \ that moment I made the wrong \u2013 or right \u2013 question of the day: \u201C\
  Ok, then. So what makes a good green wine?\u201D.\nMr. Almeida took it seriously\
  \ \u2013 \u201Ca long time ago, some families from up north decided to cultivate\
  \ grapes\u2026\u201D. I couldn\u2019t believe I had ignited Mr. Almeida\u2019s time\
  \ machine five minutes before the kick-off. When I was about to grab any bottle\
  \ and thank him for his explanation, he said: \u201Cmost of these families, like\
  \ the Nogueiras\u2026\u201D I interrupted him and asked \u201CNogueiras, you said?\u201D\
  . He nodded positively \u201Cthey were one of the best, but when the war came, most\
  \ of the family had to leave the country\u201D. \nI was paralyzed. I was a Nogueira\
  \ myself and I knew my ancestors had come from Portugal. I also knew they were originally\
  \ Jewish, but the tradition didn\u2019t move on. So, when I got back to my senses\
  \ I told what I knew to Mr. Almeida. That was when he said the following words,\
  \ which still give me chills whenever I remember them: \u201CThe name came up on\
  \ purpose. When I heard your accent and noticed your features, I guessed you were\
  \ a descendant from Brazil. You know, my family and the Nogueiras were deeply connected\
  \ and their departure left us with a great void. However, My father \u2013 and myself\
  \ \u2013 we managed to keep in touch with them through letters. Unfortunately, twenty\
  \ years ago I lost track of Aloisio, my pen pal\u201D.\nI couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ that was really happening. I looked around to check if there weren\u2019t any\
  \ cameras filming this prank. Aloisio Nogueira was my grandfather whom I had barely\
  \ met. \u201CI knew it! The northern blood is strong my son!\u201D shouted Mr. Almeida\
  \ in the middle of the shop, which was empty since the match was already approaching\
  \ the middle of the first half. \u201CC\u2019mon, let\u2019s celebrate this encounter.\
  \ I always invited your grandpa to come and meet his origins, but his pride wouldn\u2019\
  t let him and I am completely terrified of flying, so I\u2019ve never left Europe.\
  \ Come, let\u2019s drink my best Port Wine and, oh, please, add me as a friend on\
  \ Facebook, stamps are too expensive these days\u201D."
