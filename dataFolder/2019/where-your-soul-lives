Text: "Do you know that some people`s souls do not belong to the place of living?\
  \ I happened to be one of those people (please tell me that I`m not alone in it).\
  \ It takes some time to finally found, where your soul really belongs.\nIt happened\
  \ in the summer of 2016. I`m young, free and ready to embrace the whole world. That\
  \ was the time I decided to visit Spain. My choice was beautiful Barcelona. \nFrom\
  \ the first day, I felt total love for this city. I got lost in the narrow streets\
  \ of the Gothic Quarter. I spend the whole day walking along small shops and cafes,\
  \ surrounded by people, different smells and sound. The spirit of old times was\
  \ looking from every corner, making you feel like an explorer of the unknown world.\
  \ The smell of this city cannot be forgotten. Sweet and salty at the same time,\
  \ it was filled with the scents of all kinds of food, perfumes, and antiquity. This\
  \ smell has stuck in my nose and I do not want to let it go since then. Occasionally\
  \ I catch this smell in very different places and it always reminds me of good.\
  \ \nI stumbled across a small caf\xE9, hidden from the eyes of tourists by all the\
  \ small turns and twists of these winding streets. It turned up in front of me so\
  \ unexpectedly and so in time. I was starving. The small place between two trees\
  \ was filling the air around with the smell of fresh seafood. I had a feeling, that\
  \ it hides the sea around the corner. I stepped in and immediately felt at home.\
  \ An old Spanish woman met came out to meet me. Her family has been the owner of\
  \ this place for many years. This place was here long before I was born. These people\
  \ were carrying out the best family recipes through the decades, and they were happy\
  \ to let me see and taste this part of their family history. \nI was one of some\
  \ locals, who greeted me with warm smiles. I got the opportunity to try the authentic\
  \ Catalan cuisine made by the very local family that was Catalan to the bones. This\
  \ family told me lots of stories about them, their country and their city. The old\
  \ women hugged me, when I was leaving, and gave me a small book with Catalan fairy\
  \ tales dated by 1931. It was a precious gift for me.\nWhen I was walking back to\
  \ my flat, everything inside me was trembling with excitement, like when you found\
  \ something that was lost long ago. All the small details that surrounded me were\
  \ making me fell in love more and more with every passing minute. In love with the\
  \ city, local people, culture, architecture, tastes, smells, in love with myself\
  \ in this place. \nEvery day this feeling was getting stronger. This is the city\
  \ with a special spirit. The spirit of freedom, love, joy, ease, and openness to\
  \ everything and everyone. This is the city that combines the ancient and modern,\
  \ gray and bright colors, hustle and calmness. This is one of the not many places,\
  \ where very ancient parts of the city, that carry the weight of centuries of history,\
  \ are harmoniously complemented by modern architecture and surrealistic art. It\
  \ makes Barcelona incredibly unique, outstanding and unforgettable. \nAll this made\
  \ my soul realize that it has found its place in this huge world. There are so many\
  \ more places to see and explore but I had no doubt that it is the PLACE, my place.\
  \ \nWhen I was planning this trip I was expecting a nice holiday by the sea in a\
  \ beautiful city full of entertainment and must-see places. But I couldn`t even\
  \ imagine that I will find such a place, where my soul belongs to. And from that\
  \ trip, my soul is always eager to go back to this one and only city, no matter\
  \ how much I travel!\nP.S. I could never find this corner with the family caf\xE9\
  \ since then, no matter how I tried. And all that is left from it is a little old\
  \ book with amazing and beautiful fairy tales!"
