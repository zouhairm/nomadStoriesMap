Text: "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned last year, it\u2019s that when\
  \ you let go you create space for something better. When a thing has served it\u2019\
  s purpose, it will go away. If you try to hold on to something that has already\
  \ fulfilled its purpose in your life you are going to hurt yourself.  Last July\
  \ 2018 I decided to quit my job, walk away from negative people and toxic environment,\
  \ and once again pack my bag...embrace changes and living the uncertainty. I've\
  \ always wanted to learn French and experience how it's like to live in small town\
  \ in France. On the day I quit my job, I sent an email to several French schools\
  \ in France and less than 24 hours I received a reply from one of the French schools\
  \ in Nice, France. I packed my bag and started a whole new adventure from Hawaii,\
  \ LA, then Nice, France. Stepping out of comfort zone was never easy but the moment\
  \ you let go of the bad things in your life, the miracles happen. I moved into my\
  \ dream apartment in Nice,  with a balcony and walking distance to the beach. I\
  \ learn French from Monday to Friday and exploring Provence Alpes Cote D'Azur from\
  \ Cannes to Menton on the weekends. I make new friends, write a lot, create everyday\
  \ through photography and travel writing. I even find a dance studio only 10 minutes\
  \ walk from my apartment. Things truly fall into place when you brave enough to\
  \ embrace changes, trust life. For more adventures feel free to visit https://herhappinessproject.com"
