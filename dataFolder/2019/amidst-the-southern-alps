Text: "Silence, of all things, intrigued me. Especially when it was in the intimacy\
  \ of home and deliberate. Mum said incompletely, \"When Julia was born...\" and\
  \ stopped as she noticed me enter the room, never to speak about it again. \n\n\
  Around the time I was born in 1992, my parents left their country home to live in\
  \ the city. They had been living in a cottage at the foot of the Southern Alps,\
  \ glacial and covered in snow. Snow that may have buried tragedies or memories they\
  \ never spoke of, but that entwined them in a mysterious bond they brushed off as\
  \ marital bliss. I decided I had to go there and see for myself what I would discover.\
  \ I knew I had been there before.\nIt was the 15th day of November, my birthday.\
  \ I had been travelling for hours from the top of the South Island south westward\
  \ to the Southern Alps. I drove alone, savoring solitude. The aim was to get to\
  \ the Grey river that delicately laced the Alpine fault boundary, separating the\
  \ two tectonic plates. \n\nMy GPS didn't work in these parts. I followed the paper\
  \ map as best I could, archaic as it felt. Hours passed. The trees grew skyward,\
  \ and got thicker as I drove. The scenery was both spectacular and melancholic at\
  \ the same time. Solace and emptiness engulfed me. In the background I could hear\
  \ the subtle gushing of a river. I was finally getting closer to the approximate\
  \ vicinity of my 'home'. In the distance I could see dark storm clouds looming.\
  \ Approaching was an old chapel at the foot of the Alps. It was here that I sought\
  \ refuge. \n\nThe exterior was wooden featuring heavy doors and a modest heavenward\
  \ spire. I entered in. It looked historic and unused like the map I had earlier\
  \ desperately tried to decode. Natural light poured into the chapel through intricately\
  \ designed stained glass panels that extended downward from the ceiling almost to\
  \ the floor. The entire structure was held together by several Gothic styled arches\
  \ and supporting buttresses. I walked toward the altar and saw a door, from beyond\
  \ which a vicar emerged. He had light frail eyes, scanty hair but a calm and reassuring\
  \ smile.\n\"Welcome, to St Peters.\" he said enthusiastically. \n\"Hi, I'm Jill.\
  \ My parents used to live around here.\" I said. \nMy voice echoed through the nave,\
  \ \"This is a beautiful place and strangely reminiscent\"\n\"What's your family\
  \ name dear?\" he inquired. \n\"Fernandes.\" I said, examining the exquisite internal\
  \ architecture of the chapel.\n\"I knew them once.\"He paused for a moment, looking\
  \ at me as if he knew me.\n\"They lived at the far end of the woods. Come this way\"\
  \ he said and walked off. \nI followed him into the gardens, leading to the chapel\
  \ cemetery. He narrated the history of the chapel when it was in use and the stories\
  \ of the people that now lay here to rest. Never before had I taken such an interest\
  \ in the stories graves tell. Stories of the lives of entire families now gone,\
  \ but that were once lived in the very place I was now so bewildered by. \nEngraved\
  \ on one of the stones was the following.\n 'In loving memory of\nMarcus Anderson.\n\
  1887-1962.\nGrace Anderson.\n1892 - 1921.\nJunior Carl Anderson.\n1918-1919\n&\n\
  Darling Marie Anderson.\n1919 - 1920.'\n\nI soon realised this man had lost his\
  \ entire family in the span of three years. He never remarried.  Loss and heartbreak\
  \ must have plagued him his entire life. Yet here he lay with the family he once\
  \ had. My eyes teared up. The chapel, the historic graveyard, the majestic Alps\
  \ in the background, I had a moment of d\xE9j\xE0 vu. It was all coming back to\
  \ me like memories, but ones that I had never had. \n\nThe clouds darkened, a thunderstorm\
  \ was brewing. We walked along to where the graves ended and the mountains began.\
  \ The vicar pointed at a small cross. The cross read \"Baby Julia. 15th November.\
  \ 1992. Angel on Earth for a day, summoned to heaven the next\". A drop trickled\
  \ down the cross, it wasn't the rain."
