Text: "Due to the insecure situation of Afghanistan, my family decided to immigrate\
  \ to Pakistan and later to Iran in 1991. However, on September 04, 2003 we depart\
  \ to our country. Because the Taliban was somehow broken down by international security\
  \ forces and there was a so-called relative peace in Afghanistan. Besides, we were\
  \ disgusted by rude and inappropriate behavior of Iranian. On September 05, 2003\
  \ we reached the immigrants camp in Herat, Afghanistan and the first word that I\
  \ have heard and it was ambiguous for me was \u201Clook at that Hazar boy\u201D\
  \ and they chuckled. I did not know the meaning of Hazara, and later I asked my\
  \ father about it, he explained who Hazar is in details. He broadly talked about\
  \ the history of Hazara people and how they were forced to leave their motherland\
  \ and how they were massacred by Abdul Rahman Khan and the current racial discrimination,\
  \ which was somehow disenchanted for me. After the lengthy discussion, we came to\
  \ an agreement that we are not going to stay in Herat, and we should travel to Kabul,\
  \ capital of Afghanistan.  \n \tOn the way to Kabul, I have seen everything except\
  \ pleasure. From Kabul to Herat it is about 1000km but it took as four complete\
  \ days' drive to reach; there was no street as a real meaning it was just some paths\
  \ that drivers could distinguish that this is the right one if they went a bit more\
  \ to left side or right side the could go on explosive mines. However, parts of\
  \ the areas were highlighted by red color; which means the danger of explosion.\
  \ So, after a tiresome trip, we reached Kabul.\n When we reached Kabul, we took\
  \ off at an area which is called \"Selo,\" and we wanted to go to my grandfather's\
  \ house which was in the vicinity to Darulaman Palace.  This house was in rent with\
  \ someone else. The taxi driver charged us ten times higher than regular fair price,\
  \ which we later found this out.   \n Another new phrase that I have heard was \"\
  Zawarkha\" which means those who come from Iran, which was utterly confusing for\
  \ me. Indeed, such words expose the deep root of discrimination and illiteracy in\
  \ Afghanistan, which racial is one and the most hazardous one because all of the\
  \ past and present calamity of Afghanistan have risen due to that.\n \tSo, traveling\
  \ to Kabul assisted me to understand somehow what is going on in my country and\
  \ the culture that I was grew up was entirely different from the culture in Afghanistan.\
  \ It took years for us to adapt to a new culture. \n \tIn 2005, my parents decided\
  \ to travel to Bamyan, our original location in Afghanistan. Moreover, most of our\
  \ relatives were residing there. On the way to Bamyan, we have seen the beautiful\
  \ scenery of various provinces. Bamyan is famous by \"Land of Buddha\" because there\
  \ are two statutes of them, but unfortunately, the Taliban has exploded most of\
  \ their parts. Also, Bamyan is the land of Hazara, which means most of its population\
  \ is made by this ethnic group. Traveling to Bamyan was more interesting for me\
  \ than the traveling from Hamedan to Kabul because I learned the pure culture of\
  \ Hazaragi; how they treat people, how they eat, how they dance, their music and\
  \ so forth.   \n It was then I found a clear understanding of my ethnicity. We almost\
  \ spent three months in Bamyan and we have traveled to most of its parts, include,\
  \ Yakawlang, Band-e Amir, Foladi Valley, and so on. \n \tTo conclude my travel story,\
  \ I would like to state that the more you travel, the more you learn. Traveling\
  \ is a different experience. This traveling assisted me to choose my educational\
  \ major, that currently, I am doing my Master's in Sociology at South Asian University.\
  \ The reason that I have chosen sociology is this to understand the Afghan society\
  \ profoundly and appropriately and conduct researches in various parts of the country.\
  \ I hope I can be one of the participants for the Travel Writing Scholarship in\
  \ order to boost my writing skills and write more and more about Afghanistan for\
  \ its people and international societies."
