Text: "Street art and graffiti has outgrown its reputation. Where it used to be an\
  \ act of vandalism by hoodlums on subway cars, or an indicator of a dodgy neighbourhood,\
  \ now cities actually employ \"graff artists\" to paint murals on skyscrapers as\
  \ a way to encourage tourism and investment. Cities like London, New York, Paris,\
  \ and Sao Paulo, who once sentenced graff artists to long custodial sentences, now\
  \ offer a myriad of street art walking tours geared at tourists and boast entire\
  \ museums (indoor and outdoor) devoted to free-hand calligraphy, wheatpastes, and\
  \ stencilling. \n\nIn Canada, Montreal is the mecca for graff. The annual Mural\
  \ Festival invites famous graff artists from around the world to paint the city,\
  \ and coupled with music and food events, the festival adds millions of dollars\
  \ to city revenue. But in Toronto, the biggest city in the country, the scene is\
  \ a bit dead. Toronto is a great city, but it's not rich in beauty like Vancouver,\
  \ or rich in culture like Montreal. Toronto is a lot like Brooklyn . . .  except\
  \ with a future. In that sense, you could say it's rich in character. \n\nAs a self-proclaimed\
  \ \"graff hunter,\" I have travelled the world just to hunt down and photograph\
  \ the works of Space Invader, Roa, Phlegm, Shepard Fairey, and the elusive Banksy,\
  \ but my own city has left a lot to be desired. This was the thought crossing my\
  \ mind one evening as I waited for the streetcar on Queen Street West,  an area\
  \ which is the ground zero for the independent arts scene, and noticed a wheatpaste\
  \ poster across the way. Squinting through the gauze of night, I saw an image of\
  \ ethereal beauty: a weeping woman, eyes cast down, and painted in the Renaissance\
  \ fashion. I immediately recognised it as the image of Mary from Michaelangelo's\
  \ La Pieta, albeit in monochrome and with a stylised use of shadows and negative\
  \ space. It was loaded with melancholy longing and it struck a nerve. The tag on\
  \ the poster said Deadboy; the artist's sobriquet. But as I was reaching for my\
  \ camera, the streetcar approached, so I made a mental note to come back the next\
  \ day. Which I did, and promptly posted my photographs of the wheatpaste to my blog,\
  \ alongside a couple of questions: \"Deadboy, who are you? Did you love someone?\
  \ Did you lose someone?\" And to my surprise and delight, a few days later, an email\
  \ popped up in my inbox from Deadboy, and he said, \"Yes to both questions.\" \n\
  \nAfter that, Deadboy and I became friendly, so much so, that whenever he would\
  \ erect a new wheatpaste, mural, or stencil around town under the cover of night,\
  \ he would email me the locations so I could photograph them. I would spend my days\
  \ exploring my own city, which suddenly became new and fresh; running down alleyways,\
  \ peering behind dumpsters, or hopping a construction site fence. It became the\
  \ highlight of my week, because his works were so meaning-potent and fire-infused.\
  \ Suddenly Toronto had a richness to it. An embarrassment of riches.  \n\nDeadboy\
  \ started to become a local legend. He would sell-out his gallery shows on the Ossington\
  \ strip, companies would license his work for their campaigns, even the City of\
  \ Toronto hired him to paint murals. And I was so happy that my favourite local\
  \ artist, who made me love my world-weary city again, was getting the wide respect\
  \ he deserved. \n\nOne day, he asked to meet me at a cafe, so of course I agreed.\
  \ And as I'm stirring my tea at this little Italian joint, in he walks carrying\
  \ a massive canvas, 36 x 48, covered in brown paper and fastened with twine. He\
  \ hands it to me, and says, \"I wanted to give this to you, because you were the\
  \ first person to ever see the value of my art.\" I rip off the paper, and see that\
  \ the image of the monochrome, misanthropic Mary from La Pieta is staring back at\
  \ me, in all her opulent beauty.\n\nAnd it was in that moment I realised that sometimes\
  \ the best discoveries in life should be left unsaid. \n\nSpray it, don't say it."
