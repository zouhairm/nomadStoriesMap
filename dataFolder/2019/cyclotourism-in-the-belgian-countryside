Text: "The following events occured during the first semester of 2015, when I worked\
  \ as an au-pair in the city of Lille, France.\n\nThe life of an au-pair can be quiet\
  \ challenging; stepping out of your comfort zone and dealing with new cultures,\
  \ people and challenges is a rewarding but arduous experience. During my stay over\
  \ there, I managed to become friends with another au-pair, Sebastian, a Dutch man\
  \ from the town of Gouda. As you might imagine, like many of the Dutch, he was very\
  \ enthusiastic about cycling. So, during the Easter holidays, he invited me to cycle\
  \ with him from Lille to Mouscron (a small Belgian town), since he had two bicycles.\
  \ Amazed by the opportunity, I accepted without hesitation.\n\nAt dawn, we met in\
  \ the house he worked in. Then, we had a well-packed breakast and prepared ourselves\
  \ for the upcoming trip. When I asked Sebastian if we were going to use Google Maps\
  \ for the travel, he simply looked online on which cardinal direction Mouscron was\
  \ from our location and picked a compass to guide us (no kidding). I was astonished\
  \ by his bold decision, but I trusted the idea; the craving for adventure was overwhelming.\
  \ After packing some snacks and few clothes, we finally started our journey. Since\
  \ the highways didn't have much to look at, even though they were the easiest and\
  \ the fastest way to arrive, we decide to go by the countryside, where we could\
  \ visit local villages and admire the native landscape.\n\nDuring the trip we passed\
  \ by many small towns, making a stop in a long-established antique shop on one of\
  \ them; the salesman there was a very kind elderly man. However, we had a lot of\
  \ trouble communicating. He didn't understand English, French, or Dutch (which is\
  \ similar to the Belgian Flemish dialect). According to Sebastian, the salesman's\
  \ Flemish sounded too \"medieval\", few words were understood by him. After the\
  \ stopover, we had lunch at a local fries joint; I must admit those were the best\
  \ fries I ever had.\n\nAfter 14 hours of journey, getting lost sometimes and asking\
  \ locals for directions, we finally arrived in Mouscron. Sebastian previously contacted\
  \ a Belgian family on CouchSurfing, and they accepted hosting us. The house was\
  \ located on the outskirts of town, an area consisting mostly of hills (lucky us)\
  \ and fields. The air was fresh and impregnated with the scents of the blossoming\
  \ flowers of recent Spring. It still remains on my memories as one of the quietest\
  \ and most peaceful sites I have ever been in my life.\n\nWhen we arrived at the\
  \ house, we received a warm welcome from our hosts: the adolescent siblings, C\xE9\
  dric and Amelie, and their grandfather, Jacques. They greeted us and showed us the\
  \ bedroom we would occupy during our stay. However, when we headed to the living\
  \ room and started exploring the residence, we were greatly surprised by the amount\
  \ of animals that lived over there! The entire place was abundant with mysterious\
  \ tribal decoration and exotic pets: monkeys, snakes, peculiar rodents, and unusually\
  \ large spiders! Their home was basically a zoo, which Sebastian and I found to\
  \ be really fascinating and admirable.\n\nWe were then informed that Jacques is\
  \ a scientist that lived for decades in Africa, researching the local wildlife.\
  \ We had a very interesting conversation about his experiences, and then we were\
  \ invited by Amelie and C\xE9dric to go to a local \"reggae\" show in the center\
  \ of town. We accepted and we went to the event by car (my thighs were really pleased\
  \ by that). Arriving there, the music was pleasant and the local beer was delightful.\
  \ The attendees over there we very interested regarding my Brazilian nationality,\
  \ because they had \"never seen a Latin-American in their life\". Therefore, I quickly\
  \ became the \"celebrity\" of the party, resulting in many beers as gifts from the\
  \ participants and the barmen.\n\nAfter such a pleasant night, we returned home\
  \ and slept comfortably. The next day, we had a fantastic breakfast prepared by\
  \ the family: fries and apple sauce, an unexexpectedly delightful combination. After\
  \ thanking immensely our hosts, we retrieved our bikes and safely headed back to\
  \ Lille, both contented with our adventure."
