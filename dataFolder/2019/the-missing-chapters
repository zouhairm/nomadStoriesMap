Text: "\u2018What\u2019s up with you Balkan people? I\u2019ve never got a chance to\
  \ study your countries: at school, all my teachers skipped the chapters about you\
  \ saying your history is too complicated\u2026\u2019 I looked expectantly across\
  \ the puzzled gazes of my students who came from all over the ex-Yugoslavia. Despite\
  \ the recent conflicts between their countries, we were all living together under\
  \ the same roof.\nEven though I had been teaching in Macedonia for a few months,\
  \ my impression of the Balkans was still fragmented. That\u2019s why I decided to\
  \ spend a week every two months in each Balkan state.  \nI started with Bosnia and\
  \ Herzegovina. Two of my Bosnian students gave me a ride on a snowy night to Sarajevo.\
  \ One of them was Tarik, a bubbly man with warm, honest eyes who took advantage\
  \ of the many hours ahead of us to tell me about his country and the three ethnic\
  \ groups inhabiting it: Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats. He is a Bosniak, a Bosnian Muslim\
  \ who, despite living part of his childhood during the war and spending six months\
  \ in Sarajevo under the siege, is still in love with his city and has lived there\
  \ ever since. \n\u2018Remember to drink the water from Sebilj, the fountain in Ba\u0161\
  \u010Dar\u0161ija before you leave so that, if it\u2019s God\u2019s will, you\u2019\
  ll come back to Sarajevo!\u2019 \nThese were the words he left me with when they\
  \ dropped me off at the doorstep of my hostel. I turned to steal a look of the city;\
  \ however, the darkness of the night, even in the glow of the Catholic Sacred Heart\
  \ Cathedral, was too thick to distinguish anything.\nI had to wait until dawn to\
  \ see Sarajevo. I bumped into it in the dimly lit caf\xE9s which even in the early\
  \ morning are full of smoke and smokers. I followed it on dusty trams, travelling\
  \ alongside elderly women who peeked at me underneath their headscarves and held\
  \ me hostage with their mysterious chit-chat in Bosnian. Melancholic Sarajevo waved\
  \ at me from the open windows of abandoned buildings, from the burned domes of palaces\
  \ which used to make the passerby\u2019s head spin. \nIn the following days I learnt\
  \ about the longest siege in modern history and the deep sufferance endured by Bosnians.\
  \ \nOn my last afternoon I met up with Tarik near the Miljacka river. In front of\
  \ a cup of Bosnian coffee he gave me the history lesson I had been missing for so\
  \ long, a history which is tightly intertwined to his own. In September 1992 when\
  \ he was nine years old he escaped from besieged Sarajevo by crossing the city airport\
  \ runway at night. Despite the risk of the Chetniks\u2019 bullets, Tarik and his\
  \ family managed to seek refuge in their hometown Ilid\u017Ea. \n\u2018Not everyone\
  \ was as lucky as we were\u2026And still what I remember the most about the siege\
  \ is that people kept their dignity\u2026 Life didn\u2019t stop even if death had\
  \ become part of our daily routine, it was always hunting us from the hills while\
  \ we were collecting water, buying bread or going to school. Sure, humans are humans\
  \ and some took advantage of the war to make money. However, most of us helped each\
  \ other, there was a sense of community: my mother shared flour and sugar with the\
  \ neighbours even if we didn\u2019t have much ourselves\u2026\u2019\nAccording to\
  \ Tarik, the strongest weapon people in Bosnia and Herzegovina used to resist during\
  \ the conflict was the sense of humour they are famous for and which luckily does\
  \ not get lost in translation. \nAfter exchanging our 'Do vi\u0111enja' as goodbyes,\
  \ I walked back along the river. Like the fog over the Miljacka, the past of Sarajevo\
  \ covers the city like a blanket. \nPreserving time and protecting the present is\
  \ a collective mission in Sarajevo, a rule to respect even when visiting: slowing\
  \ down is required, one cannot run in the streets of Ba\u0161c\u030Car\u0161ija\
  \ without knocking down the artisans\u2019 stalls. Sarajevans gather every day around\
  \ caf\xE9 tables to tell their jokes, as if there were always time to talk about\
  \ life and death, laugh and be together. As if they were rewriting the missing chapters\
  \ of their history."
