Text: "It was already past 6 o\u2019clock when the boat engine was fired up. In a\
  \ latitude of the planet where the sun only goes to bed shortly before midnight\
  \ at this season, passengers still soaked their face with sunscreen, wary of that\
  \ night sunstroke. \n\nIt was not an ordinary boat. To enter Brazo Rico of Lake\
  \ Argentino (which borders the southern face of the Perito Moreno Glacier) the vessel\
  \ must cut, occasionally, pieces of ice broken from the larger rocks that then,\
  \ floating, watched us far away. A scenery by itself unusual, as close as I could\
  \ possibly imagine of a Shackleton\xB4s expedition. Inquisitive, I ask about water\
  \ temperature: \u201Ctwo degrees Celsius...\_enough to die of hypothermia in a matter\
  \ of minutes,\u201D said the Commander, before my regret.\n\nThe magnificence of\
  \ that\_steep white wall was remarkable. It rose to 250 feet above the water, bordering\
  \ it for 3 miles to meet the Andes Mountain chain. Invariably, it would shatter\
  \ on the edges, in exciting and cinematic crashes. Always moving, the cliff advances\
  \ and recedes, long ago, according to the vanities of the season.\n\nFrom the docking\
  \ at the pier, an Indian line followed the last traces of the arid land around El\
  \ Calafate, the base city of the expedition. Beanies, glasses, coats, scarves, raincoats,\
  \ gloves, and the most crucial: \"los crampones\". A sturdy iron structure that\
  \ stitches shoe\xB4s sole with sharp pointed edges down and forwards to the feet\
  \ \u2018s grip on the ice. On a glacier, one must walk with a horseshoe. Without\
  \ them, it\xB4ll be mostly skating.\n\nSlowly the strides ceased to scratch the\
  \ earth that now lay beneath a porous mantle. From stone to stone, flake to flake,\
  \ everything starts to clear entirely. The feet sank deeper and deeper, demanding\
  \ more of the body to launch into an endless white desert as far as the eye can\
  \ see. And that giant white cliff saw at the boat, that inhospitable drift of ice\
  \ lay, finally, underfoot.\n\nAnd walking would not be like before. Crunchingly,\
  \ the floor chatted with me each footprint. An intense connection with the land\
  \ that no longer existed and instead turned to the grossest state of the water.\
  \ Solid, she\u2019s the one pushing forward, pushing the locks of the crampons,\
  \ rocking me like a penguin. As fate did not reveal itself, amidst the snowy expanse\
  \ of the ice-sculpting garden, with no obvious spatial references, it remained to\
  \ rely on the Indian line. The queue of Babel, where the most different languages\
  \ \u200B\u200Bwere understood since enchantment and amazement are universal languages.\n\
  \nUp and down the hills of ice for more than an hour, our eyes were being trained\
  \ to see what until then had been less obvious. The melting of the peaks in small\
  \ summer showers, the wells of clear water sprouting from the bottom of the earth,\
  \ the cracks that under the reflection of light were revealed in that indigo-blue\
  \ sky day, now displayed in the sensation of walking on an adventure filming location.\
  \  A fictional experience, if it were not the ice that awakens more than any pinch.\n\
  \nIn the end, an invitation. Overlooking the lake, a polyglot party embracing an\
  \ improvised table with \"alfajores de dulce de leche\" and whiskey. On the rocks,\
  \ for sure. Ripped from the ground! It was the ultimate redemption of that sunny\
  \ night. Without any commitment to reason, we had just conquered the Ice Age."
