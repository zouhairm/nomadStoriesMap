Text: "Since I went to Cuba, my taste for the islands was settled. There is a kind\
  \ of yearn for mainland and a time feature that takes place in those lands surrounded\
  \ by the sea, which is difficult to explain in words but it feels just you put one\
  \ foot out of the plane.\n\nThe island that I was addressing this time was Ireland,\
  \ a country totally different from the Caribbean\u2019s, starting with the weather.\
  \ When I went out the first day, like an onion with infinite layers of thermal clothes,\
  \ sweaters, hats and gloves, I felt that the cold even penetrated my thoughts. So\
  \ my brain was seconds away from sending the signal to my feet to return to the\
  \ apartment and keep me there for the rest of the two months trip, \u201Dridiculous\"\
  \ I thought, so I keep walking and enter the cobbled streets of Dublin. Half an\
  \ hour later I was sheltering in a full Irish breakfast, acquiring the necessary\
  \ calories to survive. The body is wise.\n\nThe good news is that I adapted to the\
  \ weather faster than Irish English, especially because I did not have to communicate\
  \ much through him. Throughout the city you could hear Spanish everywhere, whether\
  \ it was from Spain, Mexico, Venezuela or Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nAs the days passed,\
  \ the Irish seemed closer and closer to the Mexicans because of the way they drink,\
  \ how noisy we can become and even the way of driving around the city.\n\nBut above\
  \ all, I fell for them because of his warm treatment, his taste for Mexican food\
  \ (several Irish make their own tortillas) and their effort to learn Spanish language.\
  \ So, they either have Mexican blood or we Irish blood.\n\nSoon I ventured to the\
  \ outskirts, to promised lands that I\u2019ve seen on the internet. Of course I\
  \ always smile with satisfaction when I discover that everything is much better\
  \ there, in the place. That's why I'm a passionate traveler. To be on the edge of\
  \ the Cliffs of Moher, breathing the plains and green hills and feeling the mysticism\
  \ of places so old that I thought I was in a real fairy tale.\n\nAlso the walks\
  \ through the coastal cities of gray tones and cold beaches, with their fishermen\
  \ and their seagulls fluttering, transported me to those european films that I saw\
  \ at a midnight cultural channel. The dream continued not only in the landscapes\
  \ but in the dynamics of \"trust\" that is evidenced everywhere: when making purchases,\
  \ when taking a tour without having printed your proof of payment; surprising me\
  \ about the respect of the people towards the people.\n\nBut my epiphany came when\
  \ I return to the apartment, where I was staying, walking alone at 3 am. No eventuality.\
  \ I felt safe and enjoyed the lonely streets, as if traveling through unknown lands,\
  \ as if it were a videogame, something unreal.\n\nAt \u201CEmerald Isle\u201D I\
  \ experienced the utopia that I have imagined so many times for my country, those\
  \ virtual lands where women are respected and we can walk free at any time and everywhere.\n\
  \nOf course I had heard about countries with these characteristics, but being there\
  \ made it completely clear to me that another reality is possible."
