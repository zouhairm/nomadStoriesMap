Text: "If you've ever played a classic videogame like Pok\xE9mon or Final Fantasy,\
  \ there was always the feeling when having to slog through the obligatory cavern\
  \ level, where you were out of your element and the slightest mistake could be costly.\
  \ High-level enemies, undecipherable text, twists, and turns, but once you've reached\
  \ the final leg of your ordeal, you see a shine at the end of the tunnel. You've\
  \ reached the next level, and you don't where you are.\n\nThe last few words I had\
  \ heard were still ringing in my head like I couldn't believe them. \"Welcome to\
  \ Tijuana, Mexico; have a great time.\"\n\nFresh air, hot sun and the smell of chorizo\
  \ wafting from a street cart right outside the San Ysidro Port of Entry.\n\nI had\
  \ no clue where I was or what I was doing. One minute I had been driving along the\
  \ coast of Southern California, from Los Angeles to Mission Viejo, Escondido and\
  \ San Diego; visiting friends and making memories. The next, I said I was hungry\
  \ for tacos, decided to park my rental car in a sketchy side-street in San Ysidro\
  \ and walk twenty minutes to the Mexico\u2013United States border. \n\nMy eyes came\
  \ upon on the Tijuana Arch in the distance. I didn't know what was beyond two-steps\
  \ in front of me, but when you follow the rainbow there's always gold. The beginning\
  \ was quiet, trekking across the narrow shoulder of the Puente el Chaparral highway\
  \ but as I kept getting closer, I could hear it. It was a murmur, but then that\
  \ turned into a cacophony of voices, bustling of feet and music fading in all over.\
  \ And there I was, looking up at the arch above. \"TIJUANA\" read a sign that hung\
  \ high from its peak.\n\nI had always heard that Tijuana had a bit of an \"anything\
  \ goes\" reputation. So, I let my heart and stomach lead the way down, Avenida Revoluci\xF3\
  n (Revolution Avenue) in Zona Centro, the heart of downtown Tijuana.\n\nDucking\
  \ in and out of shops, side streets, and alleys, I always finding something new\
  \ to feed my senses. From taking a picture with a Zonkey (a zebra painted donkey),\
  \ watching children play in the Plaza Santa Cecilia with colorful papel picado decorating\
  \ the street tops. Then stopping in a restaurant called El Torito. It was empty,\
  \ but the staff was friendly. I sat and ordered quickly. Polishing a plate of tacos\
  \ al-pastor, four one-dollar coronas, a margarita, I was ready to call it a day,\
  \ until I had seen an option to buy some absinthe. The waiter took my order and\
  \ took me inside to the bar. A glass of ice, a metal spoon of sugar, a lighter and\
  \ a paper cup. One drop of liquor on the sugar, he set it ablaze and I watched as\
  \ he poured a stream of absinthe from the cup over the spoon cascading a river of\
  \ fiery anise into the glass. He raised me my glass and then his own. \n\n\u201C\
  Arriba, abajo, al centro y adentro!\u201D We taught me this cheer and we threw them\
  \ back.\n\nFrom this point on it was a blur. but I had backtracked a little bit\
  \ to La Chavelas, a certain type of \"bar\". It caught my eye earlier and was where\
  \ I had nursed a glass of mezcal and sat at a table to watch \"La Flora de Fuego\"\
  \ (The Flower of Fire). From the moment she took the stage, the passion I saw in\
  \ her eyes as she danced; twisting and turning her body is still burned in my mind,\
  \ while the absinthe burned in my blood.\n\nWhen she left crowd a richer woman,\
  \ and myself a poorer man, I knew it was time to go \"home.\"\nReveling in the fire\
  \ in my veins, I retraced my steps to the border port of entry. Going back through\
  \ that same cavern level, going through annoying parts of this game again, just\
  \ to get back to levels I had been through before. \n\nBefore I was free, I was\
  \ asked by the customs agent if I had enjoyed my stay in Mexico.\n\nAnd I thought\
  \ to myself. \n\n\"Did I leave my rental car unlocked all day?\""
