Text: "As we drove further away from the city lights and into the dark countryside,\
  \ I started to wonder if I had made the right choice to visit a remote village in\
  \ northern Albania with my boyfriend of three months. It had been my idea to travel\
  \ to his hometown; he did not share my enthusiasm. For me, the trip was an exploration\
  \ of unfamiliar territory, a new experience. For Dorel, it was a journey back to\
  \ his childhood, to the town where he'd grown up under communism. \nThe road leading\
  \ to Re\xE7 was long and turbulent. Unaccompanied by streetlights, Dorel seemed\
  \ to have known the way home from memory. He pulled into the driveway meticulously,\
  \ careful to avoid the deep ditch in the middle that had been there his whole life.\
  \ As he parked the car, a ray of light shone from the front door of his family home.\
  \ His mother came out to welcome us and hugged me tightly. Inside I met his 15-year-old\
  \ sister, Anjeza. She looked up at me and said, \u201CThe whole village is waiting\
  \ for you!\u201D\nThe next morning, Dorel and I made our way to the main restaurant\
  \ in the village owned by the only people who live there - his family. We were stopped\
  \ at every house by his smiling aunts and uncles and cousins offering coffee, food,\
  \ homemade raki, a local fruit brandy \u2013 anything they had. The first woman\
  \ I met just stared at me. Anjeza, one of the few who spoke English, explained that\
  \ their aunt had never seen an American before. The woman quickly ran inside her\
  \ home and came back with a tray of juices, coffee and snacks. The ten-minute walk\
  \ to the restaurant turned into a two-hour journey with lots of coffee and laughter.\n\
  Walking through his village tucked into the rough-hewn mountains felt like walking\
  \ through a postcard I had never seen before. Situated in Mal\xEBsia e Madhe, which\
  \ means \u201Cgreat highlands\u201D in Albanian, Re\xE7 seemed to be protected by\
  \ nature. As I looked around, in awe of my surroundings, Dorel pointed to a field\
  \ where he used to play soccer with his friends. He told me that when he was nine\
  \ years old, a chestnut tree began to grow in the middle of the field. The chestnuts\
  \ it dropped made it too difficult to play barefoot. To remove the source of the\
  \ spiky inconveniences, he got a bomb and placed it by the chestnut tree. Then he\
  \ ran up one of the mountains with his friends and blew it up. They told no one,\
  \ and the village thought they were being attacked. \u201CWhere did you find a bomb?\u201D\
  \ I asked. He laughed and said, \u201CThey were so easy to find. They were everywhere.\u201D\
  \ When I was nine years old in Oregon, I wasn\u2019t allowed to go outside without\
  \ supervision.\nAs I looked around the now barren field in awe of his story, he\
  \ showed me the fruit trees that were too high for him to reach as a young boy.\
  \ He used to make slingshots and hit branches while one of his friends stood below\
  \ to catch the fruit. They would collect berries on branches like skewers for a\
  \ snack. When they couldn\u2019t eat any more of the fruit they had collected, they\
  \ would give the rest to the village cow. \u201CShe loved me,\u201D he said with\
  \ a shy smile. \nDorel was guiding me up a mountain as he told me stories of his\
  \ childhood when he stopped and said, \u201CEmma, why did you want to come to Albania?\u201D\
  \ The look of genuine curiosity in his eyes stopped me. Where do I begin? The untouched\
  \ landscape filled with mountains that seem insurmountable, but somehow a nice Saturday\
  \ morning hike in Dorel\u2019s eyes. The people who made me feel more welcome than\
  \ anywhere else in the world and loved me, a stranger, without hesitation. The stories\
  \ I heard of unity among all Albanians; a feeling I\u2019ve never experienced in\
  \ America. A country with so much generosity and tolerance masked by its poverty\
  \ and scars. He wanted to leave and never come back. It was my first time but I\
  \ knew it wouldn\u2019t be my last."
