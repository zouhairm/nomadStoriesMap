Text: "A Mongolian nomadic herder sits across from me on horseback and passes a hand\
  \ rolled cigarette to me as we survey his herd, five hundred strong. His son is\
  \ close by, yelling at me to come and help with the evening chores. We maneuver\
  \ our horses to round up our herd of sheep and goats and usher them a few miles\
  \ away in the subzero temperatures to the one of the last areas of arable grazing\
  \ land. After taking care of the horses, we trek back to our ger in a snowstorm\
  \ and I help prepare dinner by the light of fire, while steeling myself for the\
  \ bitterly cold night to come. As we eat our dinner of rice while sitting on the\
  \ ground, my host family\u2014my family\u2014shows me games and teaches me the Mongolian\
  \ language. It is then that I go back outside to round up our herd alongside my\
  \ ten-year old brother for the night and patrol the outskirts of camp for wolves.\n\
  \      The stifling black of night is remedied only by the brilliant stars of the\
  \ Mongolian steppe, illuminating our herd and landscape ever so slightly. My brother\
  \ and I circle our herd, eyes alert for danger, while the snowstorm of the evening\
  \ grows in inclemency. I see my brother\u2019s eyes dart back and forth, and in\
  \ an instant, he takes off running, yelling the Mongolian word for wolf. In that\
  \ moment, my instincts take over and I tear off after him, running in the direction\
  \ of the danger, bent upon protecting both my brother and their herd\u2014their\
  \ livelihood. I force the herd to move in the opposite direction of the wolves and\
  \ grab a handful of small stones that I hope will be enough to drive off the predators.\
  \ I was able to communicate to my brother and ask him to move the herd while I went\
  \ after the wolves. I continued in a sprint towards the edge of the herd, throwing\
  \ rocks and forcing sheep and goats out of my way in pursuit of an enemy I could\
  \ not see. The wolves are as black as the night itself, and without the aid of a\
  \ flashlight, I could only guess where they were and hope that I was driving them\
  \ off. \n      A Mongolian nomadic child sits on the ground in the dead of night,\
  \ recovering from the scare of the wolves, and explaining to me the importance of\
  \ one goat. To him, they not only delineate his life and legacy\u2014they actually\
  \ are it\u2014directly providing for my family\u2019s physical needs and enabling\
  \ my brother attend school. Though their herd is large, having one animal die or\
  \ be killed has a significant impact on their ability to survive. The winter this\
  \ year was unusually harsh, making springtime barren and forcing us to move the\
  \ herd more often to find areas where we could graze the animals. My brother hates\
  \ the wolves because they represent his failure to protect what is his. To him it\
  \ is a matter of life and death, and while I was living with him it also became\
  \ a matter of life and death for me. \n      To be a nomad is to be resilient, resourceful,\
  \ strong, and capable. To be a nomad is to read the skies and the steppe, to listen\
  \ to the herd, to domesticate that which is wild, and to be full of life. I left\
  \ the comfortable American college life and leapt into the unknown that is the wild\
  \ frontier of Mongolia, living and studying amidst nomadic herders, learning their\
  \ way of life, and being accepted and included as a part of the family. We laughed\
  \ together, worked alongside each other, and I learned endless life lessons from\
  \ their wise words. To be a nomad is to leap into the unknown every day. To be a\
  \ nomad is to find freedom in the heart of the wild."
