Text: "During the first semester of last year, I had one of the most rewarding experiences\
  \ of my life. I had the opportunity to go on exchange to France where I have managed,\
  \ among other things, to learn the local language, make great friends and above\
  \ all, fall in love like never before. \nEverything in life ends, and my journey\
  \ was not the exception to that rule. On July 28th, it was time to return to my\
  \ country, leaving all that joy behind. To top it all, three days later, I had to\
  \ take my last exam to graduate as a mechanical engineer in Buenos Aires. There\
  \ were too many things inside my head, although none of them was willing to study.\
  \ Fortunately, I managed to draw a sigh of energy and finally passed the exam. At\
  \ that point, graduation rather than bringing relief caused noise inside my head,\
  \ because now, I also had the responsibility to choose what to do for the rest of\
  \ my life! I was feeling like a buoy wandering aimlessly around the ocean. For that\
  \ reason, I decided to follow the known path my parents had instilled in me since\
  \ I was a child. Then, age 25 and holding my engineering degree, I was distributing\
  \ my CV everywhere going after a \u201Cconvenient\u201D life. \nHowever, some weeks\
  \ later I suddenly realized that I had to fulfill my burning ambition of going to\
  \ Machu Pichu. It was the perfect opportunity to me as I I was counting on something\
  \ extremely valuable, TIME. Therefore, I decided to purchase a bus ticket from Salta\
  \ to San Pedro de Atacama and began my adventure. During my journey, I made great\
  \ connections and got to know incredible places such as San Pedro, Uyuni, La Paz,\
  \ La Isla Del Sol until finally arriving in Cusco. Before being there, I had always\
  \ had in my head the image of the magnificent sacred temple of Machu Pichu. Nevertheless,\
  \ when I saw it myself, it was breathtaking. I could not believe my eyes just standing\
  \ in front of that wonder. It was then that I realized that there is no more beautiful\
  \ picture than the one taken with your own eyes. No one can convince you that magic\
  \ exists, you have to witness it yourself to believe. \nHowever, most things are\
  \ not as one imagines them. In my case, they were much better! Not only did I come\
  \ across Machu Pichu, but also discovered some other wonderful places around such\
  \ as Laguna Humantay, Valle Sagrado and Rainbow mountains. Even the city of Cusco\
  \ was quite impressive. In fact, I fell so in love with Cusco and its surroundings\
  \ that I decided to stay there and work as a volunteer at a hostel. Apart from knowing\
  \ a beautiful place, it also allowed me to get the best out of myself. I had always\
  \ been afraid of ridicule when it came to performing in public; yet, being there\
  \ I managed to get rid of my stage fright. \nAfter forty days in the capital of\
  \ the Inca Empire, I decided that my time there had ended. Nevertheless, instead\
  \ of going south on my way back to Argentina I headed north. First, I went into\
  \ the Peruvian jungle of Iquitos where I took a 13-hour boat trip to the triple\
  \ border between Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. It was precisely in this last one that\
  \ I settled down. I set out working as an assistant translator on tours through\
  \ the Colombian Amazon. Thus, I got in return lodging, meals and, of course, a jungle\
  \ adventure. I doubt very much that I will go back there but I am sure about one\
  \ thing: I will treasure that time for the rest of my life. \nTo sum up, it is due\
  \ to my journey that I have awaken my travelling soul. Beyond that, the most important\
  \ lesson of it has been that it is not a choice to feel lost or aimless at times.\
  \ However, it is actually a choice whether to stand still or do something about\
  \ it because any rough time can turn out to be a blessing in disguise."
