Text: "I turned 50. The end..... or so I thought.\n\nHaving grown up in a tiny mining\
  \ town at the top of Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, Australia, I was naive to\
  \ say the least when it came to life beyond my back yard.\nOf course I did what\
  \ was expected of me... school, job, marriage, babies.\nBy the time my mid life\
  \ crises came around at 50 years of age I had completed the cycle expected of me,\
  \ with a few random bits of shit thrown in for good measure.\nJob, marriage, baby,\
  \ divorce, marriage, job, more babies and heading for second divorce.\nLike thousands,\
  \ maybe millions before me, I happened across the movie The Way, about a spiritually\
  \ devoid group of people walking the Camino Santiago in Spain.\nHaving never left\
  \ Australian shores or traveled alone before, I decided this adventure was for me.\n\
  I had quit my job as a Rural Remote nurse in a very isolated Aboriginal community\
  \ in Cape York, informed my husband I had been cheating on him and packed my bags\
  \ prior to being told.\n\nArriving in Paris was soul destroying.\nI couldn\u2019\
  t speak a word of French, got lost at every turn and thought I would die of hypothermia\
  \ in the freezing conditions.\nMaybe my job and marriage hadn\u2019t been so bad\
  \ after all?\nAfter much ado I managed to get myself to the wrong train station\
  \ on my way to Biarritz, where my itinerary indicated a one night stay before I\
  \ went on to St Jean Pied de Paul where my 800 km walk was to begin.\nAwestruck\
  \ by the cobble stone pathways and historic stone wall embracing the eclectic mix\
  \ of cultures, joining as one to embark on the same journey, my self doubt and anxiety\
  \ morphed into excitement and a sense of belonging.\nDay one negotiating the Pyrenees\
  \ Mountain brought with it the cold, hard realisation of the physical and mental\
  \ challenges ahead.\nMy only moment of glory came when I managed to limp past a\
  \ pilgrim worse off then myself, in tears, nursing hypertension and associated cardiac\
  \ disorders with a glaring sense of defeat.\nAs kilometres turned into wine bars\
  \ and villages turned into adventures, I began to find a me which had never seen\
  \ the light of day. \nAs my confidence grew, I began socialising with the masses.\
  \ \nA young gentleman from Brazil became a constant companion, who, with high functioning\
  \ Aspergers disorder, preferred not to speak or show emotion... perfect!!\nTogether\
  \ we became a two person team, enduring and enjoying a full life on the trail which\
  \ lasted for eight incredible weeks.\n\nThe daunting prospect of life after the\
  \ Camino soon loomed.\nHow could I possibly return to Australia to look life, as\
  \ I knew it, in the eye and say \u201CI still love you\u201D.\nI couldn\u2019t and\
  \ I haven\u2019t.\nAs I write these words, I sit alone on the verandah of a nurses\
  \ unit in the Torres Strait Islands, waiting for the phone to ring to attend my\
  \ next medical emergency.\n\nThere is no such thing as a midlife crisis... it\u2019\
  s simply the yearning to be free."
