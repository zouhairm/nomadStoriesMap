Text: "I had expected Casper, Wyoming to be unremarkable. \n\nGoogle satellite images\
  \ had shown me a flat, drab town, the absolute opposite of my undulating, colorful\
  \ San Francisco. Wyoming, the parts that are not the Grand Tetons or Yellowstone,\
  \ seemed more foreign to me than any other country I\u2019d been to before. The\
  \ entire state is less populated than the city I grew up in, and I imagined a place\
  \ with little diversity, except for variations in facial hair and cowboy boots.\n\
  \nBut I'd come here\u2014despite my doubts, on a whim\u2014to teach outdoor education\
  \ on Casper Mountain.\n\nEvery day, I snowshoe around the lodge, cutting paths through\
  \ firs and pines to reach aspen in the valley. Footprints and fallen branches weave\
  \ a living tapestry with the snow. And, like snowflakes, no two days are the same.\
  \ Today the uphill is especially hard. My mind is a pool of muddled thoughts and\
  \ nagging questions. Since there aren\u2019t kids around, I collapse, compacting\
  \ the powder beneath me. I take comfort in the way the snow pillows around me, muffling\
  \ the drumming of woodpeckers and pitchy chickadee calls. I lay still, corpse-like,\
  \ my body heat dispersing into the ground despite many layers of down and wool.\n\
  \nArms spread wide, I feel that I am embracing the entire sky. My heart is happy\
  \ for the break, no longer suspended 5 feet off the ground at 8000\u2019 elevation.\
  \ Eyes closed, I listen. Waves of wind whip through pine needles, whistling. Lodgepole\
  \ pines creak and groan as they bend away from their midlines. Widow-makers, they\u2019\
  re called. Amidst the harshness\u2014sub-zero temperatures, wind that makes welts\
  \ emerge from my face, and blinding, bouncing light\u2014there is music. There is\
  \ something simple and sublime that stirs my inner creature. \n\nMountain chickadees\
  \ flit above me, and I marvel at how they manage to stay warm. Once my limbs are\
  \ almost numb, I stand and make my way back to the lodge. I know that inside holds\
  \ the coziness of the fireplace the scent of fresh sourdough bread. \n\nWyoming\
  \ is the last place I ever thought I would end up. But on this mountain surrounded\
  \ by never-ending plains, I\u2019ve found a special place with snow enough for a\
  \ thousand white Christmases. Its sparseness offers space for my thoughts to fill,\
  \ to intertwine with the cutting, howling wind."
