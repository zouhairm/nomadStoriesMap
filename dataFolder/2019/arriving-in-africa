Text: "I arrived at Glen Afric on my first non-educational or family-related trip\
  \ with a pit in my stomach the size of my overpacked suitcase. In just a few short\
  \ weeks volunteering, I wanted to be able to change the world, at least a little\
  \ bit. \n\nAfter a sleepy journey from Johannesburg to Hartbeespoort, I opened my\
  \ eyes to see a long giraffe neck right outside my car door. I ooh-ed and ahhh-ed\
  \ with the other new volunteers as I stepped down from the van nervous, but eager,\
  \ to begin my gap year as I\u2019d always intended. I didn\u2019t know what to expect,\
  \ but from the moment I arrived, I knew this place would be lifechanging. \n\nI\
  \ hauled my suitcase into a fenced-off area labeled \u201Cquarantine.\u201D This,\
  \ I was told, was where I\u2019d be sleeping and spending my free time. The fence\
  \ surrounded an open area with hot, sticky dormitories, bathrooms, offices, and\
  \ a lounge with a very popular VHS player. I was told to keep the fences closed\
  \ at all times to ensure the animals didn\u2019t end up on the wrong side. I laughed\
  \ at the idea of caging people to protect animals, until I woke up one morning to\
  \ a dazzle of zebras outside my door.\n\nAfter getting acquainted with my new sleeping\
  \ quarters, the fresh arrivals and I were shown the animals for whom we\u2019d be\
  \ caring. As we walked the dirt paths, a senior volunteer reminded us not to leave\
  \ the designated areas where dangerous animals may be lurking. Nodding, another\
  \ new volunteer tried to lighten the mood by howling Toto at the top of his lungs.\
  \ In response, our guide quickly advised us not to step on the dirt, which is filled\
  \ with small metal particles, during a thunderstorm. The mood remained enthusiastically\
  \ somber.\n\nThe first animal we saw was an old cheetah with strong shoulders that\
  \ stood out as he walked. His home lined up to ours with a fence that seemed it\
  \ wasn\u2019t nearly tall enough to keep him from escaping, even with electricity\
  \ pulsing through it. Still, we were assured we would be safe, and later we were\
  \ granted the privilege of going inside his home.\n\nThen we walked over to the\
  \ lions. We watched as more seasoned volunteers threw heavy pieces of horse meat\
  \ slashed in various cuts over the fence. Experienced Glen Afric workers and South\
  \ Africans directed the volunteers which male lions ate first, as if they were pet\
  \ cats arguing over mice, only with much higher stakes. \n\nWe continued on to the\
  \ hyena, a shrewd female whose yips and laughs were the highlight of the day. She\
  \ begged for food the minute she saw us coming. The volunteers happily obliged,\
  \ throwing her a hefty piece of meat she quickly tore to pieces. \n\nThen, three\
  \ elephants came rushing down the dirt path holding great big stalks of grass in\
  \ their trunks, their tusks glistening in the sunlight. I stepped back and waited\
  \ as the giant creatures stomped heavily past, sniffing at my camera and hair as\
  \ they went.\n\nFrom then on, my time at Glen Afric was no longer a mystery. Every\
  \ day I woke up and began my work caring for the animals. I swept and shoveled elephant\
  \ dung into rickety old wheel barrels and scoured the ground for gnawed-out bones\
  \ in the leopard enclosure. I pulled stinging weeds from tall grasses and ran electric\
  \ wire between cages. \n\nMy first night there, I marveled at the lion\u2019s roaring\
  \ and jumped at the hippo\u2019s grunts. Soon, I\u2019d require these sounds to\
  \ fall asleep. My first day, I wouldn\u2019t have touched the raw meat so carefully\
  \ selected for our charges, but just a week in and I was throwing a piece to my\
  \ favorite albino lion. Though the place was different from home, just being there\
  \ made me realize how much the differences didn\u2019t matter. People from the U.S.,\
  \ U.K., Canada, Iceland, Israel, and more had come together because they believed\
  \ their time there would make a difference. While I\u2019m still not sure if it\
  \ really did, I know one day when I go back the elephants will remember what I did\
  \ for them. After all, an elephant never forgets."
