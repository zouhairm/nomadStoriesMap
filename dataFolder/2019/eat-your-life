Text: "There is a phrase which every mexican use to say: \u201Ccomete el mundo\u201D\
  \ which translates: \u201Ceat the world\u201D, which means to live your life without\
  \ fear, to make your dreams become true, to follow every goal you have.\nIve been\
  \ in another countries and it change my life totally, not only the people I met,\
  \ but my mind changed completely into good terms. Ive become (and still working\
  \ in it) in a better person.\nI was raised by two persons with a very hermetic mind,\
  \ so my goal was to find a good job, good money, good house, good husband and thats\
  \ what I wanted. \nNot anymore, I wanna be happy, I wanna become a person who knows\
  \ about other\u2019s minds, cultures, Flavors, food.\nI wanna write a book to people\
  \ who is settling. I wanna make people to think what they really want. \nThis year\
  \ I got sick, and maybe it was cancer, but finally it was not cancer (Thank God,\
  \ or whatever it was) I started to think that life is very short and the years passed\
  \ and you make the Choice of being happy or not. \nI do not know if cancer is gonna\
  \ beat me next year or in 5 years or in 10. In the mean time I wanna be the best\
  \ version of Myself, and I wanna make people to pursuit their happinness, to meet\
  \ theirselves. \nIt is more like a personal \u201Cfounding theirselves \u201C book.\
  \ \nThat is why I selected that title instead of eating the world, eat your fucking\
  \ life! Eat every single Day, hour minute, because the time is clocking, the life\
  \ doesnt wait for us."
