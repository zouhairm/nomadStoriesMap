Text: "I sat with my back pressed up against the cool cobblestones, trying to force\
  \ some feeling back into my unexpectedly numb body. I removed my ever-swollen feet\
  \ from my seemingly shrinking boots. My blistered and battered toes looking as worn\
  \ and tired as I felt. Their mission was complete, they had reported for duty and\
  \ carried me 800 kilometres across Spain through rain, hail and shine. Literally.\n\
  \nIt had been an easy hike through the mountains that morning. Everyone on the trail\
  \ was teeming with high spirits and a craving for achievement that floated in the\
  \ air between us and spurred me along the path. Luck and circumstance had seen me\
  \ complete my journey just as I had started it, excited but alone with only my thoughts\
  \ for company.\n\nMy load felt a great deal lighter than the one I had taken off\
  \ with thirty-six days earlier. As though with every step along the winding trails\
  \ between Saint Jean Pied de Port and Santiago my troubles had slipped away, but\
  \ unlike Gretel and her trail of breadcrumbs I had no intention of retracing my\
  \ steps to find them. Without so much as a glance backwards I marched into Santiago\
  \ eager for that sense of success and relief that would surely await.\n\nMy pilgrimage\
  \ through Spain had broken me, both physically and mentally but not a single encounter\
  \ along the way came close to preparing me for the emptiness I felt when I reached\
  \ that final courtyard. I am still not sure whether it was disappointment at the\
  \ out-of-place scaffolding that weighed upon me or whether it was the complete loneliness\
  \ at having no one to celebrate my achievement with. So, there I sat, in my own\
  \ pit of solitude and observed the others parading into the square.\n\nI watched\
  \ as the endless stream of pilgrims took the final steps of their journey. I searched\
  \ their faces, hoping to find a familiar one or at least one that shared some of\
  \ the unwarranted disappointment I was feeling. But it seamed like an infinite sea\
  \ of smiling faces, congratulatory hugs and blissful words of relief. I have never\
  \ felt more alone than I did in that moment.\n\nI had made many friends along the\
  \ journey but as are the ways of the Camino, and life it seams, people come and\
  \ go. So in that moment, I found myself grieving for friends I had known for no\
  \ more than a few days but who had shared with me their life stories, their dreams\
  \ for the future, and the struggles that found them along the Camino. They are faces\
  \ I would never forget but that I would never see again. So, instead of celebrating\
  \ I said my goodbyes and silently wished them good luck.\n\nAs the emptiness subsided\
  \ and the exhaustion set in I decided to make a move. I swapped out my hiking boots\
  \ for sandals and began to make my way from the square. A smarter traveller would\
  \ have unloaded those boots then and there but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to let\
  \ them go. I had suffered too much of a loss that day already. Parting with my only\
  \ other support system from the journey was not an option.\n\nJust as I reached\
  \ the outskirts of the square and was about to slip into the crowds of locals and\
  \ off into life\u2019s next adventure I heard a voice behind me call my name. I\
  \ turned to face it, praying that the voice was as familiar as I hoped. The warm\
  \ smile that greeted me sent an instant calm throughout my tired body. We had shared\
  \ a simple ten-minute conversation over dinner a week prior, but something made\
  \ him stop to give me my own congratulatory hug and I will always owe him for that.\
  \ Because in that crowd of weary pilgrims he taught me that life\u2019s biggest\
  \ achievements aren\u2019t worth nearly as much if you don\u2019t have a familiar\
  \ face to share them with."
