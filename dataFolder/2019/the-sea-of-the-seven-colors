Text: "A few years ago, I was on vacation in the Island of San Andr\xE9s, a Colombian\
  \ archipelago in the Caribbean, near the coast of Nicaragua. I was almost at the\
  \ end of my trip and I had indulged myself in many of the pleasures this crown jewel\
  \ of the Colombian seas has to offer.  I had enjoyed its sandy beaches at the North\
  \ End, went to a beach party at the old, artsy neighborhood of San Lu\xEDs, visited\
  \ the local alligators (known as babillas) at the Big Pond in La Loma and contemplated\
  \ life as I stood by the Hoyo Soplador, a coral sea geyser located in the southern\
  \ tip of the island. \n\nBut there was a big part of the trip that I was still missing:\
  \ scuba diving at the world-famous \u201CSea of the Seven Colors\u201D. Although\
  \ the whole island is surrounded by beautiful, multicolored crystal-clear seas,\
  \ the colors at the Big Reef near Johnny Cay are truly a spectacular view, but when\
  \ I went to Johnny Cay a thunderstorm raged on and it was impossible for me to go\
  \ scuba diving. We had to stay at the beach bar until the storm passed, and then\
  \ it got too late.  \n\nAt the Big reef, an enormous variety of marine life can\
  \ be seen, including fish of literally every color on the planet. The colors are\
  \ mesmerizing as the predominant blues and greens of the sea combine with the whites\
  \ and brows of the coral and the yellows, reds, purples and many others of the species\
  \ in the sea. I felt my soul twitching at the thought of leaving San Andr\xE9s without\
  \ enjoying such a breathtaking place. But at that moment, it seemed I had no choice.\
  \ \n\nOn the next day after my journey to Johnny Cay, I attended the opening of\
  \ an Art Exposition by the brazilian-born painter Aurea Oliveira, who made San Andres\
  \ her adoptive home since the eighties. I was still bummed as I walked into the\
  \ art exhibit at Sunrise Hotel but when I reached the middle of the hall, I experienced\
  \ one of the most strange surprises I have whitnessed in my whole life: hanging\
  \ there, in the middle of the room, there was a big painting of the Sea of the Seven\
  \ Colors and it looked tremendously real. I stared at the painting for almost an\
  \ hour and after that I told Aurea that she had, without knowing it, made my trip\
  \ complete."
