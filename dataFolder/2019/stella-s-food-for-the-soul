Text: "Finding myself with my sweet husband and a wonderful group of people in Tanzania\
  \ ushering in the New Year was a dream experience that I can't still quite wrap\
  \ my head around. Volunteering to help others turned out helping me in more ways\
  \ than I could ever imagine. So intrinsically beautiful was the profound love I\
  \ saw in the main 'house mother' and cook who fed each of the 25 orphaned girls\
  \ every single day, breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner.  Stella, \"Stoic\
  \ Stella\" or \"BB Stella\" and her supporting sisterhood of 'house aunties' who\
  \ also tend to the girl's needs has such a humble presence in the home. I was so\
  \ eager to get close to her and be 'her friend' that I made an effort everyday to\
  \ make eye contact, thank her and compliment her for amazing food. A beautiful woman\
  \ with an outwardly older looking complexion (from her hard life) but an inwardly\
  \ youthful spark that glinted in her small eyes and glowed in her almond chocolate\
  \ complexion. \n\nLife there stands still and yet moves at a sacred pace in the\
  \ pursuit of survival and joy. The happiness there, though fleeting because of the\
  \ shortage of resources is not stunted because of the eternal joy the people hold\
  \ in their hearts and share in their smiles. I witnessed a love so great and a truly\
  \ spiritual caring for one another that I feel like we left that special place so\
  \ much better than when we arrived and it's all because of the connections made.\n\
  \nStella and I had a running joke that I would bring her back a beautiful man to\
  \ marry when I came back to visit the home, she said \"bring me a tall American\"\
  \ and I would say, \"even better, I'll bring my Dad, a handsome British man.\" She\
  \ would laugh, the ladies in the home would chime in with their squeals of joy and\
  \ I knew I had broken through to her. When she called me 'daughter' in passing one\
  \ day in the kitchen as I went to clean plates after one of her delectable lunches,\
  \ I welled up inside with such joy. I was a 'daughter' to her too, different but\
  \ universally the same a the 25 girls she takes care of everyday, she took care\
  \ of me for two blissful weeks. \n\nShe feeds all the girls and loves on them in\
  \ the best way she could as well as the staff at the orphanage. With tough love\
  \ when needed and with sweetness when called for. Watching her watching each girl\
  \ eat around the well-worn in wooden dining tables and their sweet feet dangling\
  \ just inches above the ground. Drinking their precious water in their cups fetched\
  \ from the well on the property. Seeing her watch the girls and like the mother\
  \ lion of the tribe seeing to each one of them getting the nutrition and love they\
  \ need, to grow into the strong, beautiful girls they are. All because of the restoring\
  \ and healing power of the permeating love and the food for not only their growing\
  \ bodies but their growing souls. The seemingly small victory to others but grand\
  \ one for myself was feeling 'let in' to her embrace, sharing a tear with her on\
  \ the day we left and knowing she remembered my name."
