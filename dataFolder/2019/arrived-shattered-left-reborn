Text: "Recently divorced and 3 year advocacy project collapse left me depleted and\
  \ lost. On a whim, and desperately needing to run away, I booked a 4 day trip on\
  \ my own to New York City. I was completely terrified and having done no travelling,\
  \ I had no idea what expect. \nLanding at the JFK airport, a wave of anxiety, sweat\
  \ and loneliness washed over me, with betraying thoughts of what the heck was I\
  \ thinking? It literally took one step after another to get me to my hotel. \nWhen\
  \ stepping into my place of stay at Roosevelt Hotel in midtown Manhattan, there\
  \ was something comforting seeing the old architecture and sweeping ceilings. My\
  \ breath slowed down and shoulders relaxed. \nThe staff smiles and greetings were\
  \ much needed medicine and slowly my inner fire sparked. \nThat first walk through\
  \ Manhattan on that hot September day was like Travolta Saturday night scene. The\
  \ smells, the sights, the smiles, slowly glued the cracks in my soul. Sitting in\
  \ Time Square with a hot dog and a homemade sangria, I looked around in disbelief\
  \ that I was there, on my own. I DID IT! \nHaving booked severe tours throughout\
  \ my trip, women from all over the world were very curious as to why I was there\
  \ by myself. I poured my heart out and received invaluable advice, guidance and\
  \ cheers. \nThe thing that surprised me the most was how friendly New Yorkers are.\
  \ I chatted with everyone, everywhere I went. \n Going out for dinner was the only\
  \ time I felt lonely but the bartenders Anthony and Tony at the hotel took care\
  \ of me. I was wrapped in their care and concern for this Canadian woman travelling\
  \ on her own.\nI never felt once unsafe whilst the smiles I received were uplifting\
  \ and healing. \nFinding myself again in New York, confidence and passion were relit.\
  \ \nThis broken Canadian single mom who usually buries herself in nature  didn\u2019\
  t expect to find herself on the gritty, yet reassuring streets of NYC. \nArrived\
  \ shattered. Left reborn.\nThank you NYC!"
