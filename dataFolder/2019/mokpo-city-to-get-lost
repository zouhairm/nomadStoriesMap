Text: "The day I arrived in Mokpo happened to have a heavy rainfall. So, because of\
  \ that, I ended up going straight to the hotel as walking around the area was not\
  \ easily possible. I believed this was a good choice as the hotel has a really nice\
  \ and cozy coffee shop on the first floor. So I waited at the coffee shop before\
  \ my check in time. Sitting in the cafe and watching the rainfall outside the window\
  \ was an amazing way to start my day. After a few hours enjoying my time in the\
  \ cafe, I was told my hotel room was ready.I was explained how to get to my room\
  \ and when I got there I was stunned by the view outside of my window. It was just\
  \ amazing.Everything was perfect and I could not have been happier. The bathroom,\
  \ the beds, the rooms cleanliness, the equipment, everything was in place and ready\
  \ to use. It was raining all day outside so I spent the rest of a day in my room\
  \ working on my own.During the evening, I was able to call the reception desk and\
  \ order food from the cafe on the first floor.After dinner, I just worked a bit\
  \ more looking at the stunning view from my room. In the morning I packed my stuff,\
  \ went downstairs, passed the keys to reception and the only thing just left in\
  \ my mind is how good my last day was.\nDoes it ever happen to you that you want\
  \ to take a break from the noise of the city and find yourself in a quiet place,\
  \ where only you and nature, where people around are not in a hurry. Then this park\
  \ is just the place that you have been looking for a long time. An open park that\
  \ conveys the pleasant noise of a river flowing nearby, the scent of flowers that\
  \ relaxes you. It's so nice to walk here so you forget about everything around and\
  \ just enjoy this moment.The view from the morning is beautiful as the view at night.\
  \ In the evening, you can take a walk and find a peaceful bench to rest on. During\
  \ the nighttime, if you look at the sky, you can see the stars that are missing\
  \ from the night sky in Seoul.My hotel was not far from this park, which meant the\
  \ view from my window was an amazing view of this park. I cannot pass up the fact\
  \ that you can rent a boat and ride on the river. If you need to take the time for\
  \ a rest, which will leave you relaxed and comforted, this place is for you.The\
  \ park does not have a set time of being open, so you can enjoy it at any hour of\
  \ the day.\nDid you know that Korea is surrounded by mountains? So, the mountain\
  \ located here is Yudalsan Mountain.It is 15 minutes away from my hotel. The mountains\
  \ are not considered the highest in Korea, so it took me only 40 minutes to climb\
  \ to the top. The view from the top is amazing. It\u2019s as if the whole city was\
  \ in the palm of your hand. I do not know about others but, personally, climbing\
  \ mountains gives me motivation. It\u2019s as if I am working toward my goal, and\
  \ by reaching the top of the mountain, I have achieved it. When I see that unforgettable\
  \ view from the top, I begin to believe in myself and in my bright and successful\
  \ future. At the top there are several places to view, such as the temple and cable\
  \ cars.I visited the temple, which I really enjoyed. During my visit the cable cars\
  \ were unfortunately not working, but I believe a ride on the cable car would be\
  \ unforgettable. Sunset,it was so beautiful that no photo could convey this beauty.The\
  \ long bridge nearby gives an even better view of the sunset from small place called\
  \ Nakjodae Overlook which was a perfect place to view the sunset.\nI had my dinner\
  \ in a close by Italian restaurant. After dinner with thoughts of great memories\
  \ i made in this small town i take a road back to Seoul."
