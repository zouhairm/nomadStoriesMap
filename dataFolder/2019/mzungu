Text: "\u201CWhere are you taking my sista\u2019, Morgan?\u201D After a few days,\
  \ I had become accustomed to seeing Charity at the door of our building dressed\
  \ in camouflage, a military-grade rifle with a full clip across her lap. Hers was\
  \ not an interrogation, just simple curiosity. She\u2019d grown fond of me and I\
  \ of her. We slap-shook hands, as is the custom in Uganda to express fondness. \n\
  I went down the rust-colored road where Morgan had indicated, my ankle-length skirt\
  \ swirling up crimson clouds. Upon entering the salon, more than one eyebrow lifted.\
  \ Mzungu visitors are virtually unseen in rural Uganda, and in a hair salon downright\
  \ non-existent. \nPreparations for my visit were organized by a local named Nora;\
  \ impulsivity was inadvisable given my golden locks. Book in hand, I settled in\
  \ for the next several hours as six women worked simultaneously on my braids. The\
  \ knot at the base of the scalp is the most difficult part I learned and there is\
  \ one stylist who specializes in this. The others finish the braids \u2013 essentially\
  \ the chorus of this coiffeur opera. The number of people who \u201Cjust-happened-to-be-walking-by-and-dropped-in-to-say-hello\u201D\
  \ that day was reaching comical proportions. Word had spread that the mzungu was\
  \ getting plaits and my personal opera soon became a community affair. Unfazed,\
  \ I read on marveling at the dexterous performance surrounding me. \nHeading further\
  \ into town after my salon experience, I passed textile shops, food stands and various\
  \ other vendors. Men sewing on machines lined the dusty walkways. The marketplace\
  \ was bustling with activity. Nevertheless, people would still stop to ogle the\
  \ novelty of a muzungu with a crown of blond braids strolling past. \u201CYou look\
  \ smart!\u201D A young woman said boldly as I passed. Smiling, I thanked her. Genuine\
  \ was the word that came to mind. People were friendly and curious and not timid\
  \ in asking questions. \nNext stop -- retrieving a parcel. My theory that all post\
  \ offices are abominably bureaucratic was confirmed yet again. It\u2019s never a\
  \ quick in and out; there\u2019s always something missing \u2013 a form, another\
  \ step\u2026 Unsurprisingly, I was absent a document necessary to locate my package,\
  \ so I had to return to the apartment. I hadn\u2019t gone ten steps when I stopped\
  \ dead in my tracks\u2026a marabou stork about my size was approaching me. Having\
  \ never seen one of these astonishing avian beasts, I observed it with a wary eye,\
  \ but it simply sauntered on by, completely indifferent - the only one seemingly\
  \ unmoved by the mzungu in its path. Later I would learn these extraordinary creatures\
  \ were ubiquitous to the region and regarded everyone with the same disdain. \n\
  I spent my afternoons working at the internet point where I had first encountered\
  \ Nora. That day, I gifted her some delectable alfajores I had brought from Argentina.\
  \ My new friend had been an incredible source of help and information and I wanted\
  \ to thank her. The simple act of giving a gift in thanks was not customary, which\
  \ surprised me at the time given the generosity of spirit abounding there; but now\
  \ it makes sense as gifts aren\u2019t necessary in such a selfless culture. \nWhile\
  \ there, the other patron in his conspicuously white dress shirt watched with intrigue\
  \ as I unwrapped my alfajor. I offered him half and his complete surprise at this\
  \ unassuming gesture made me smile. His face transformed from intrigue to ecstasy\
  \ as his teeth passed through the smooth chocolate outer layer, then the tender\
  \ cookie and onto the velvety dulce de leche filling. In a place where the word\
  \ \u201Cdelicious\u201D is the same word as \u201Csweet\u201D, I could only imagine\
  \ how his palate was processing this explosion of cloying sweetness. It literally\
  \ left him speechless -- no easy feat for such chatty people. All the same, his\
  \ ecstatic silence conveyed tacit approval. \nAlmost as if on cue, the power failed.\
  \ Fortunately for us, the computers ran off of car batteries -- ingenious in a land\
  \ experiencing regular 12-hour electrical blackouts. I couldn\u2019t help but admire\
  \ the combination of resourcefulness and imagination of these lovely people. Not\
  \ for the first time I mused that when the zombie-apocalypse hits, this mzungu hopes\
  \ she\u2019s in Uganda."
