Text: "Romancing With Nature\nAround 7:30 pm we left for Ranthambhore, our next destination.\
  \ Post 8 hours of travel, we landed at the luxury tents of Sultan Bagh at 3 am.\
  \ The mere glimpse of those tents under the twinkling stars drove away our tiredness.\
  \ Staying at Sultan Bagh will always hold a special place in my memories since it\
  \ offered an idyllic picture of nature with a touch of the royal Rajputana hospitality.\
  \ Moreover, it is here, where we \u2014 as a couple \u2014 found our peace amidst\
  \ the noise of the animals.\n\nTents at Sultan Bagh\nBeing a wildlife and nature\
  \ enthusiast, I was eagerly waiting for our visit to the Ranthambhore Wildlife Sanctuary.\
  \ So as morning struck, we geared up for the safari but unfortunately, got delayed.\
  \ This happened because of the unavailability of transportation facility from our\
  \ hotel to the pick-up point for the safari. Later at the sanctuary, we came across\
  \ merely a wild cow and a peacock. Even then, the wild safari itself turned out\
  \ to be an aesthetic experience for us.\n\nThe area surrounding the tents at Sultan\
  \ Bagh\nHell of a Ride\nShortcut to Bhangur\nIn a short trip, while tackling the\
  \ lust for visiting as many places as possible, time is always a pain. So, even\
  \ when Bhangarh was not included in our package, we decided to pay a visit to the\
  \ fort infamous for being haunted. This is when we ran into another couple headed\
  \ towards the same. So, we all left Ranthambhore at 2:30 pm but were put way behind\
  \ schedule by a tire-puncture. After losing more than an hour and with the 5 pm\
  \ deadline lurking on the head, it was now down to a battle between the roads to\
  \ Bhangarh and our car. Along with the sun shining bright and excitement running\
  \ through veins, our car stormed through the dusty roads of a shortcut. We never\
  \ realized when an unfortunate delay turned upside down and we actually ended up\
  \ enjoying the wild ride.\n\nThe spooky Bhangarh Fort\nWe reached Bhangarh after\
  \ braving a huge traffic jam. We were keen on visiting the place because ghost stories\
  \ have always fascinated us. Though hunting trouble didn\u2019t yield much, as we\
  \ didn\u2019t come across any ghost spirit, but we definitely sensed negative vibes\
  \ exuded by haunting silence of the place. On our way back to our hotel in Jaipur,\
  \ we made a stop at Chowki Dhani, where we ended the day with a lavish dinner served\
  \ with folk music and dance.\n\nExperience at Chowki Dhani\nDAY 2 Jaipur \u2013\
  \ The Pink Galore\nPosing inside Hawa Mahal\nThe last day of our trip and it was\
  \ time to visit the heart of Rajasthan \u2013 Jaipur. With a number of architectural\
  \ marvels to visit, we started off by visiting Hawa Mahal, followed by Jantar Mantar\
  \ and then Ajmer Fort. The tiring day was then complemented by a delicious dinner\
  \ at Lal Mass. Lastly, we captured the colors of Rajasthan by buying some authentic\
  \ Jaipuri items, before calling it a trip!\nDay 1: Ajmer and Pushkar \u2013 The\
  \ Kickoff\nWe took off from Mumbai at 10 am and it took us about three hours to\
  \ land in Ajmer. The hotel stay turned out to be amazing since the hotel was impeccably\
  \ neat and pleasant. After being transferred to our hotel, we made the best out\
  \ of our leisure time by exploring the streets of Ajmer. Since it was a Friday,\
  \ we met a huge Namaz-crowd. While we were waiting in a narrow lane, somebody suggested\
  \ us to get inside an old structure and unknowingly we entered the Deevan Sahab\
  \ Ki Haveli. The place holds historical importance since it was home to Khwaja,\
  \ Ajmer Sharif.\n\nThe main entry of Bramha Temple\nAfter visiting Ajmer, we were\
  \ then taken to Pushkar where we visited the only Brahma Temple in the world. The\
  \ aura of the temple was very calm since the place is not very commercialized. The\
  \ temple visit was then followed by a Camel Ride at the nearby desert. We started\
  \ the safari well before sunset but after covering a few meters, our camel refused\
  \ to walk. In the process of getting another camel and restarting the ride, we ended\
  \ up losing an hour"
