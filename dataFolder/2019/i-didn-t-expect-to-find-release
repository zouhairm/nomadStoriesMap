Text: "The shabby cat's amber eyes peered at me from behind the dingy paw it so coyly\
  \ licked. I had just knelt to offer it my hand when my tour group trotted up the\
  \ rain-slick cobblestone street, the color of which nearly matched my new feline\
  \ friend. San Gimignano lay before us, awaiting my students' wide-eyed gazes. \n\
  \nFollowing behind my small group, we admired a museum of medieval torture, which\
  \ boasted their fully-functioning guillotine. Some of the more fearless girls in\
  \ our group posed for giggly guillotine pictures before noticing the world-famous\
  \ Gelateria Dondoli in the Piazza della Cisterna. We all ducked inside for samples\
  \ just as a fine mist fell from fleecy clouds above, sending innocent bystanders\
  \ to shelter beneath fortresses. Peering from the gelateria's window, I allowed\
  \ myself to feel homesick for just a moment, to let the overwhelming Italian beauty\
  \ fade away and the warmth of home and family and my grandmother's hugs replace\
  \ it. But my grandmother's death was the push I needed to leave home for broader\
  \ horizons, to see things she always wished to see and live an adventurous life\
  \ she always wanted. \n\nI shook my head and walked outside to feel the rain and\
  \ remind myself to live in the moment--in the soggy, sodden Italian moment. That\
  \ always seemed to be a constant battle: remembering the past versus living in the\
  \ moment. While I appreciated the stray cat's appropriate timing in our day (we\
  \ had found her just as the sadness had begun to rise within me), I  couldn't forget\
  \ to be just as locked in to the present. \n\nContinuing on, we passed a small souvenir\
  \ cart with pins and postcards one of which had a lovely oreo-colored cat emblazoned\
  \ across its front. Smiling softly, I offered the tiny beshawled woman at the cart\
  \ coins in exchange for a card. \n\n\"Grazi,\" she said, and I bowed my head in\
  \ response, too afraid to let out my thick-as-molasses southern drawl in any attempted\
  \ Italian. \n\nWe continued our ascent past the centuries old family fortresses\
  \ and battlements, smiling at the other tour groups following their leaders. \n\n\
  \"Hey, what's with the whole cat thing?\" my coworker asked after a few quiet seconds.\
  \ \"You have bought a cat postcard in every town so far. \n\nSmiling sheepishly,\
  \ I said, \"Seeing cats makes me feel like my nana is with me. She had a thing for\
  \ cats.\" \n\nBeing forced to say talk about her in past tense sent shots of pain\
  \ through my chest, but her memory left me warm. Thankfully, my coworker nodded\
  \ in understanding without asking for more details. \n\nWe reached the city's summit\
  \ and were greeted by a view of the sprawling stone battlements and patina roofs\
  \ in the waning sunlight, ruddy with satisfaction at finally breaking through the\
  \ grey storm clouds. We gathered our students and chaperones together for a quick\
  \ picture above the city with the soft rolling sage green Elsa Valley framing San\
  \ Gimignano. Exhaling a breath I hadn't realized I was holding, I smiled into the\
  \ camera's lens, counted to three, and shouted \"Prego!\" as the camera clicked."
