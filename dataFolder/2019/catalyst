Text: "Why is it that even the best laid out plans don't materialize? Despite having\
  \ all the means and the efforts. The sweat and tears poured into it, the years of\
  \ constant yearning and the desperation. Why is it that nothing ever goes according\
  \ to our wishes? \n\nWe name it as Destiny.\n\nWhy is it that sometimes our dreams\
  \ don't match our realities ?\nWhat is really our purpose ?\nHow do we know that\
  \ the path life had laid down for us isn't the one we wanted , but is best for us\
  \ ?\nHow do we realize our Dharma ? Our own purpose for existing .\nThis is the\
  \ age old conflict between a dreamer and her reality .\nExcept this time , both\
  \ wins .\n\nThe story of a girl who was pushed into something she didn't even knew\
  \ existed. An aspiring lawyer who had to change paths and become a yogi. Battling\
  \ depression and anxiety with so much hatred for the world. She set out in search\
  \ for her purpose in life. Stumbling over a life changing love and looking for the\
  \ will to wake up everyday, she kept going and ended up in the beautiful village\
  \ on the coast of Italy. With only her journal and pen as an escape she found her\
  \ place in her world."
