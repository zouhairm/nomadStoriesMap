Text: "The smell of a bonfire always awoke in me pleasant memories and granted appeasement\
  \ and tranquility. And giving that something delicious was cooking, the foretaste\
  \ of future feast supplemented. However, that time it was rather different. For\
  \ three consecutive days nothing had been cooked on a bonfire, except for the tea\
  \ from herbs and needles. We were on the Baikal shore, both beautiful and wild.\
  \ Having completed a 14 days march through the Barguzin range we reached the point\
  \ where the speedboat had to bring us food supplies for the rest of the trip and\
  \ carry to peninsula Saint Nose. Unexpectedly, the speedboat didn\u2019t arrive.\
  \ We didn\u2019t see it the following day and the day after. By then we run out\
  \ of food which had not been eaten during the march through the mountains. Luckily,\
  \ another group of travelers carried us to the peninsula in their boat, inside the\
  \ engine-room, stinking of oil and diesel, and looking more like a steamboat from\
  \ a museum than a working ship.\nOnce we had reached the peninsula, around 100 kilometers\
  \ separated us from the extraction point, and covering this distance without food\
  \ supplies definitely could not encourage us. So, we decided to wait for our speedboat:\
  \ now the mobile communication was available again, and we negotiated a new date\
  \ of delivery. Unfortunately, due to the storm the boat was quite unlikely to leave\
  \ the port in next two or three days. We expected to wait for it eating mushrooms,\
  \ as we did in the mountains, but we soon discovered, that this food, so typical\
  \ for the spurs of a Barguzin ridge, did not grow on the peninsula. Eventually,\
  \ our daily diet included pine nuts and soap made of water and two or three tiny\
  \ fishes, which sometimes happened to take the bait. So, we decided to examine the\
  \ shore of the peninsula in a desperate desire to find shop or a local farmer, who\
  \ may sell us some products, even if it would cost us a pretty penny.\nThree hours\
  \ after leaving the camp, we found ourselves in front of an old shack, similar to\
  \ the one which children all around the globe construct to hide their treasured,\
  \ like books about pirates, commemorative coins and wooden swords with a convoluted\
  \ patterns, made with the grandpa\u2019s soldering iron. Indeed, this one definitely\
  \ was made much more reliably and for goals more practical-oriented. Right from\
  \ the rooftop several nets fell down, two rods leaned on the wall and the smell\
  \ of a dried fish left no doubt about its owner\u2019s business. However, having\
  \ knocked the door and entered, we did not find the man we expected to see. Instead\
  \ of a hardened fisherman, there was a laddie, sitting on a bunk bed. Tanned and\
  \ fit, he looked at us with eyes full of a wisdom, more common for Nepal wise man\
  \ than for a boy who didn\u2019t even go to school yet. \u201CFather is absent.\
  \ Will be back soon.\u201D \u2013 he told us. And then, after an awkward silence,\
  \ he added: \u201CTea?\u201D. Drinking tea on an empty stomach, when the whole house\
  \ was packed with a fish, smelling better than in a Michelin restaurant, was absolutely\
  \ impossible. We asked a boy for some food, offering him our money, but he just\
  \ smiled and gave us three big fishes, adding that notes and coins were useless\
  \ there. But his excited look at my compass gave an idea of how we may pay him back\
  \ his generosity. I untied the rope of a compass and throw it to him. \u201CLet\
  \ it help you catch your marlin, old man\u201D \u2013 said I. While the boy tried\
  \ his new outfit, we dedicated all our attention to the fish. The fresh fish, smelling\
  \ with an aspen smoke just melted in a mouth. We had completely forgotten the etiquette,\
  \ pulling out the meat and swallowing it almost without chewing. Scales, small bones,\
  \ everything faded away once we tasted the fish so delicious and juicy. Even now,\
  \ tasting some seafood, I invariably remember this boy, who fed some strangers and\
  \ hope that the compass I had given him would show him the way, which \u2013 maybe\
  \ \u2013 would cross my own."
