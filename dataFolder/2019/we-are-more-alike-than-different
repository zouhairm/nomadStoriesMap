Text: "\"They want to make us see who is the boss...\", my driver mumbles under his\
  \ breath.\nIt's 1 A.M. local time as I sit in the back of a beat-up minivan, making\
  \ my way from the Amman Airport to Petra.  I smile as we pass a parked police car,\
  \ realizing why my driver was so irritated.  I had just met Yosef, but I could already\
  \ tell communication would be difficult.  I don\u2019t speak Arabic and his English\
  \ was spotty.  But, I appreciated his effort and tried making a connection, \"Are\
  \ they looking for people going too fast?\u201D \n\"They look for anyone, does not\
  \ matter what you are doing.  They want to feel like big man!\"\nWe laugh together,\
  \ and I see his smiling eyes look back at me in the rear-view mirror.  \nThis was\
  \ my first time in the Middle East and to be honest, I had no idea what to expect.\
  \  As a single female traveler, I am forced to constantly balance adventure and\
  \ safety.  On each vacation, there are hundreds of warnings flooding my head \"\
  Don't tell anyone where you are staying, don't put in earbuds it makes you look\
  \ less alert, dress like a local, don't drink too much when you go out, trust your\
  \ instincts...\"  To be fair, my mother would not be thrilled that I was driving\
  \ in the middle of the night with someone I just met into the dessert of a foreign\
  \ country.  But my gut was telling me that Yosef was a kind man just trying to do\
  \ his job.\nScreeeeeech... maybe not.\nThe van veers off to the side of the road\
  \ and we make a sudden stop.  My heartbeat begins to pick-up and I feel a lump forming\
  \ in the back of my throat.\n\"You want something?\" Yosef looks back at me.\n\"\
  ...What? Umm... no?\" I was half confused, half terrified.\n\"Okay!  I will be back!\"\
  , he opens the door and walks off towards a shack resembling a convenience store.\
  \  Once my adrenaline rush tapers off and I realize what just happened, a wave of\
  \ relief washes over me, and I begin to giggle.  What kind of store stays open until\
  \ 1 A.M.?  My giggle turns into a laugh as I unclench my fists and feel my body\
  \ relax again.  I see Yosef's head pop out of the shack and he approaches the van,\
  \ looking proud of his armful of goodies.\n\"For you!\", he says, handing back orange\
  \ juice, chocolate, and what looked like a granola bar.  I instantly feel guilty\
  \ for doubting my new friend.  \nWe slowly pick up speed again and my eyes scan\
  \ the outside darkness, looking for any indication of how much of the 4-hour journey\
  \ we've completed.  \n\"They believe that they own this road!\", Yosef groans as\
  \ we pass by another parked police car.  With every new police car and slow-moving\
  \ semi-truck, Yosef voices his frustration.  Each time I smile and realize how similar\
  \ things are no matter where you go.  \nFor the next 3 hours, we talk about the\
  \ political climate of both our countries (to the best of our small communicative\
  \ abilities).  I learn about his family and his favorite spots to eat in Paris.\
  \  He is in awe from my description of Hawaii.  And before I know it, we've pulled\
  \ up to the hotel.  Yosef helps me with my luggage, gives me a large grin and a\
  \ firm handshake, and takes off down the driveway, waving until he is out of sight.\
  \  I am left standing in awe of the humble kindness of a man in a beat-up minivan,\
  \ ready to embark on what the rest of the country has in store."
