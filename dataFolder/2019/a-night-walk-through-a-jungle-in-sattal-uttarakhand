Text: "'A night walk through a jungle'\n\n\nSattal was our destination and we were\
  \ ready with our bags, \nBut the bus broke down and the plan had to drag.\n\nNo\
  \ plans, no activities, what next? We had no clue. \n'Jungle night trek', came a\
  \ voice, oh! that's come so new.\n\nThe mist was setting in and the temperature\
  \ falling down,\n'In the jungle within the dark', even the thought was scaring around!\n\
  \nClimbing up the hill and walking on the roads, \nStories, laughter, friends and\
  \ all so loads.\n\nTaking along the sand and talking to the neighbouring snows,\
  \ \nFar away from the city, this temple stayed on its own. \n\nWe all sat down,\
  \ to see the miles of darkness surround, \nIt was us and the dog, and nobody else\
  \ around!\n\nThe stories of the lost and the stories of the heights,\nThe stories\
  \ of the stars and the stories of haunted nights.\n\nA whispering silence while\
  \ crossing the barren lands, \nWe see the blurring temple when we take back a glance.\n\
  \n'Quiet' when he said and everyone got so scared, \n'Here the start of jungle',\
  \ and at once we all crumple. \n\nSlow but not so steady, we stand in a row, \n\
  Cold so blood and the worried brows!\n\nTrees and the bushes gathering us inside,\
  \ \nThe narrow paths might have some leopards walking beside!\n\nCrossing with us\
  \ was the silence of fear, \nThe sounds of footsteps and our breaths we could hear.\n\
  \nThe start was lost and the end was somewhere... \nJust following the sand, every\
  \ path was unaware.\n\nJumping over the fallen trees and holding onto the standing\
  \ greens, \nWalking on the edge of the path, scared about the forest scathe. \n\n\
  Staring at the ground, frightened to look beyond, \nWith courage we put the lights\
  \ around, to see the deep valleys going down. \n\nTall so trees, playing music with\
  \ the breeze, \nAnd then very soon, they are hiding the moon.\n\nDancing of the\
  \ leaves and passing of the breeze, \nThe magical sounds of blue and chirping sounds\
  \ of few. \n\nTrees and the birds, water and the winds, \nThe dog and the moonlight,\
  \ soon our companions of the night. \n\nFollowing their path, taking the mystery\
  \ along,\nSomewhere in the midst, we just lie down. \n\nGazing at the stars and\
  \ the moving satellite,\nNow the moon has won, it's clear and so bright.\n\nThey\
  \ all so far but still so close, \nThey all so apart but still make our part. \n\
  \nLost in the bushes, lost in the forest, \nLost somewhere unknown, but still feels\
  \ our own. \n\nWalking with them all, no fear of the fall, \nWalking with smiles,\
  \ no count of the miles...\n\nThe shinning leaves and the lost calls of deer, \n\
  Our friends leaving back and we knew the end was near.\n\nThe lost end was found\
  \ and once again the silence around, \nThis time the silence was not the fear, this\
  \ silence was of leaving the near!\n\n-Nikita Karamchandani"
