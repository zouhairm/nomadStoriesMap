Text: "AHAA! FOR SOME PEEPS, TRAVELLING DEFINES AND THRILLS THEM OR GIVES A REASON\
  \ TO DISCOVER THEMSELVES FROM THIS SAME SHITTY ROUTINE. FORTUNATELY, I\u2019M ONE\
  \ AMONG THAT SQUAD. THINGS THAT KILLS ME MAKE ME FEEL ALIVE. IN FACT I WANT TO BECOME\
  \ WANDER-LOST (HAHA). IT\u2019S MY CHILDHOOD  FANTASY TO TRAVEL EVERY INCH OF THIS\
  \ WORLD, WAKE UP EVERY MORNING IN A NEW CITY, MEET UP DIFFERENT PEOPLE, MAKE MY\
  \ TASTE BUDS TRY LUSCIOUS AND MOUTH-WATERING DISHES, LEARN NEW LANGUAGES AND SEE\
  \ OUR SOCIETY WITH SET OF NEW VISION AND LIST GOES ON.\n\nIN THE TRAVELLING WORLD,\
  \ NO ONE IS STRANGER, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOM WE COULDN\u2019T MEET YET. I WOULD\
  \ SAY TRY TO BE A NOMAD IN THIS STUCK-BUSY LIFE. IMAGINE, YOU ARE IN AN UNKNOWN\
  \ CITY WITH PEOPLE AROUND WHOM YOU NEVER SAW BEFORE, NO LOCAL SIM AND YOU HAVE TO\
  \ SPEND A LIFE FOR A WEEK. SEE, HOW EXCITING THAT SOUNDS!! SO, ALWAYS BE OPEN TO\
  \ NEW CHALLENGES, AND AS WE ALL KNOW \u201CLIFE STARTS AT THE END OF OUR COMFORT\
  \ ZONE\u201D. DON\u2019T KNOW WHETHER MY DREAMS WILL COME TO EXISTENCE OR NOT, BUT\
  \ STILL I WILL GIVE MY LEVEL BEST AND TRY TO EXPLORE NEW CULTURES AND CITIES. YOU\
  \ SHOULD ALSO, IT\u2019S GREAT AT LEAST GIVE IT A SHOT ONCE.\n\nNOWADAYS, MANY PEOPLE\
  \ SWITCH CITIES FOR STUDY OR JOB PURPOSES. I REQUEST THEM DON\u2019T SIT BACK AND\
  \ THINK ABOUT YOUR OLD GOLDEN PLACE. YOU ARE AT A NEW PLACE, TRY EVERYTHING YOU\
  \ CAN BECAUSE THE PLACE YOU CAME FROM IS GOING NO WHERE. SO, TRY TO TAKE A BAG FULL\
  \ OF MEMORIES FROM THIS NEW PLACE. LIFE IS ALL ABOUT MAKING EVERY SECOND COUNT.\
  \ I THINK I STRONGLY HAVE MADE MY POINT AND INSPIRED YOU TAKE CHANCES. TILL NEXT\
  \ TIME, KEEP EXPLORING. I\u2019M ALSO ON HUNT. HASTA LA VISTA!!\n\nFOR SUGGESTIONS/\
