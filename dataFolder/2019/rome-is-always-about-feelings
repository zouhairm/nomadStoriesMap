Text: "Rome is a city of a dream for many: eternal, unshakable and infinitely romantic,\
  \ multi-layered like a cake, as ancient as an aromatic Italian wine, as friendly\
  \ as a kitchen in the parental house, where always tasty to feed. About Rome poems\
  \ were dedicated, people constantly talk about it's dramatic beauty from the pages\
  \ of social networks, magazines, television, make films about. Travel beginners\
  \  hanker to come to explore it's secrets and peculiarities of lifestyle in order\
  \ to trump awareness with others, thereby changing the beginner's yoke to the title\
  \ of a travel expert. \nEvery time my coming to Rome, I understand that this is\
  \ a city which subsists, which changes over the years, acquires great value as an\
  \ antique item, and at the same time gives rise in it\u2019s womb to new forms.\
  \ If journey starts early in the morning from from Piazza Bocca della Verit\xE0\
  , walk past the oleander bushes along the paths to the Temple of Hercules of Olives\
  \ with a round tiled roof relying on small, white columns; accompanied by the rising\
  \ sun, making it\u2019s way because of the dense crowns of centuries-old pinyas.\
  \ Then you will plunge into the atmosphere of the first inhabitants of Rome, who\
  \ worked in the port on the Bull Forum, find yourself on the famous Cloaca Maxima,\
  \ along which they went to work in the port. Getting up at dawn, the workers began\
  \ shipping or loading cattle, which then cropped up on Roman markets and on the\
  \ tables of the citizens. In honor of the god of commerce stands a Temple of Portun,\
  \ turned gray from the time and life adversity, but beautiful for it's laconic.\
  \ Behind his back, it hides the destroyed territory of the port and warehouses along\
  \ with lush bushes. \nStrolling through Cloaca Maxima, past temple of Ceres, you\
  \ will come across the eyes of the Roman goddess of the morning and the fertility\
  \ of the Mater Matuta, and you will find Circo Massimo, where the sun will shine\
  \ with caressing light in all it\u2019s glory for a new day and new opportunities,\
  \ to highlights the richness of the colors of the urban landscape. As if by magic\
  \ you will notice that everything comes to life. Vitality spreads around the city\
  \ with golden streams, city shops and cafes begin to open, running lovers appears\
  \ on Circo Massimo tracks, some mothers seat children in car to drive to school,\
  \ shutters open in the distance and elderly Roman comes out to the balcony with\
  \ a cup of coffee to greet sunrise and check weather outside the window. Another\
  \ beautiful Roman morning for all residents, and for free.\nMeanwhile, you will\
  \ begin to circle from Pallatin, trying to memories all ancient Roman buildings,\
  \ able to see the houses of Romulus and of Libya, along the bridges, to see the\
  \ aqueduct and a full dozen temples on the Aventine Hill, the pyramid of Cestia\
  \ and Villa del Priorato di Malta. Moving about to Capitol Hill, recognizable in\
  \ all photographs, gathering around itself daily crowds.\nIf you are lucky to become\
  \ a spectator of a wedding photo shoot. A beautiful girl in a white will be trying\
  \ to do as little movements as possible to keep herself beautiful, the way she saw\
  \ herself in the mirror this morning. Older women will gaze at her, remembering\
  \ something, one of will receive a hot kiss and a hug from her husband, the father\
  \ of the bride, of course, who thanks the wife for such a beautiful and adult daughter.\
  \ Young girls will hide awkwardness and ineptly trying to be useful on a day when\
  \ everyone\u2019s attention is focused on their friend. Merry laughter and jokes\
  \ will spread. And you will be fascinated to look, a little uncertainly. And hardly\
  \ force yourself to move on, make a wish at Roman sights, in holy places, so that\
  \ you can have fortune or love.\nAnd She, of course, lurks everywhere. You can fall\
  \ in love with near basilicas, parks, near the Troyan market, near the Golden House\
  \ of Nero. Circling through you will forget about the time, and only slowly dying\
  \ light will force you to brush away the open window for shooting on smartphone\
  \ to figer the time. Having slipped the Colosseum to find that your phone and head\
  \ full of photos, delightful pictures of city life, and in front - lies the Tiber\
  \ with jade water. The sun of gold-guard will color buildings and passers-by, cars\
  \ like a magic loot of Photoshop, creating an incredibly sensual picture. Rome is\
  \ a city where nature itself creates it's body, hides dilapidation behind, where\
  \ sensuality is poured everywhere and mixes with a bright Italian cheerful character."
