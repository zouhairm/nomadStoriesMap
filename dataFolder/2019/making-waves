Text: "We crossed our first checkpoint before dawn. We were in the heart of the Holy\
  \ Land, and the checkpoint was a valve: as we pumped through at 120 kilometres an\
  \ hour, I saw cars with green and white Palestinian plates queueing in the other\
  \ direction. We had spent less than an hour travelling the width of the country.\
  \ I\u2019d read that for some Palestinians, a ten-kilometre commute can take four\
  \ hours. My chest tightened. \u201CReconsider your need to travel to the West Bank,\u201D\
  \ the Australian government had advised us. It was too late for that now. \n\nFrom\
  \ the backseat of Adva\u2019s Peugeot, I gazed into the dark desert, and read the\
  \ roadsigns that flashed up like verses from the Old Testament: Jerusalem, Judea,\
  \ Jericho. We pulled into a gas station at Kalya. Kim and I sat under a date palm\
  \ and ate boiled eggs while Adva bought coffee and cigarettes. Kim and Adva had\
  \ trained together in Melbourne as dancers. When Adva had told us she was leaving\
  \ her leafy seaside apartment to move back to Israel, I couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ why. \n\nWe drove on. The sun was still tucked behind the Abarim mountains. To\
  \ our west, I half-expected to see Tusken Raiders peering out from behind the bare,\
  \ rocky outcrops. We passed a second checkpoint, and then Adva stopped in the dry\
  \ dirt. I stepped out of the car and saw white horses dancing on the Dead Sea\u2019\
  s shimmering surface.\n\u201CAre they waves?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CNooo!\u201D Adva\
  \ said. She stared at the whitecaps. \u201CIn all the times I\u2019ve been here,\
  \ I\u2019ve never seen that.\u201D\nThe Facebook universe had warned us about the\
  \ salt: \u201CDon\u2019t swallow the water, don\u2019t pee, and above all don\u2019\
  t get it in your eyes!\u201D But no one had told us to pack surfboards.\n\nWe followed\
  \ a sandy track to the shore. The rising sun brought gusts of wind that shook the\
  \ apple of Sodom trees and blew hot air in my face like I had just opened an oven\
  \ door. We laid out our towels next to a freshwater pool, stripped down to our undies,\
  \ and waded into the sloshing sea. The stinging salt found its way into every cut\
  \ and scratch. I tried to float on my back but the waves were too big, and I had\
  \ to strain my neck to keep my head out of the water. \n\nWe got out, lathered ourselves\
  \ in thick, grey mud, and sat down between the driftwood and the junk. We weren\u2019\
  t alone. I saw a makeshift tent in the distance beyond the bulrushes. Behind us,\
  \ a man with cropped hair lay on a mattress in the shade of a tamarisk tree, naked,\
  \ drinking beer and smoking cigarettes. To our right, an old man wandered back and\
  \ forth as though he was looking for where he\u2019d left his clothes, or his God,\
  \ or simply trying to remember why he was here. \n\nKim was back in the water. \u201C\
  This is a magical place,\u201D I said to Adva. \u201CI feel like I\u2019m at the\
  \ edge of the world. Or the bottom of it. The edge of time, even\u2013 like time\
  \ has stood still. And to think that human civilisation began on the other side\
  \ of those mountains\u2026\u201D\n\u201CBut you wouldn\u2019t want to live here,\
  \ right?\u201D Adva said. She broke off a piece of knafeh and gave it to me. \n\u201C\
  Toda,\u201D I said. The sugar stuck to my fingers. I crunched quietly.\n\u201CWe\u2019\
  re not even meant to be here, right?\u201D Adva said.\n\u201CI\u2019m not sure anymore.\
  \ I think both sides have valid claims to this land\u2026\u201D\n\u201CMany Jews\
  \ and Arabs agree. More than you might think.\u201D\nI nodded slowly. \u201CAnd\
  \ you?\u201D\n\u201CYeah, it\u2019s not perfect. But Israel is my tribe. I want\
  \ to give it a go.\u201D She wrapped a red scarf around her head. It wasn\u2019\
  t yet eight o\u2019clock, but the summer heat was oppressive. \u201CWe should go\
  \ soon.\u201D\n\u201CSure,\u201D I said. \u201CTen minutes? I\u2019m going to try\
  \ and catch a wave.\u201D"
