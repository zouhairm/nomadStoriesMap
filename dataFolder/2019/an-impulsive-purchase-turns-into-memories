Text: "\"Oh wow! There is a promo ticket Jakarta - Makassar returns for only 20 bucks.\"\
  \n\n\"I say, we must go\"\n\nThat was the short conversation at the bar after my\
  \ noon class.\nI was not really close with my (not so) best friend at that time,\
  \ when we were talking about how desperately we need a break from our routine in\
  \ pursuing the Master of Arts title.\n\nA month later, we made the trip.\n\nWe even\
  \ just figured the details of our trip when we landed at Makassar. Sort of trying\
  \ to googling what is the main interest here. \nAfter few minutes, I told her that\
  \ we should try to visit Toraja since if we are lucky enough, we will be able to\
  \ join the traditional funeral ceremony. \n\nPeople of Toraja believe when they\
  \ died, the family needs to pay respect to them and spend extra extra extra money\
  \ on the ceremonial to honor and maintain their power in society. \nOften, when\
  \ the money is not yet enough to cover it, they wait for years after to do the ceremony.\
  \ They put the coffins below their house and they use the magic to wake the coffins\
  \ and ask them to walk to their final place.\n\nIt was decided then we should go\
  \ there then we went to the bus station where we could buy the ticket; took the\
  \ latest trip of the day. Voil\xE0 woke up the next morning at Toraja City when\
  \ it was still too early for any shops to open their doors but still enough to fuel\
  \ the travel agents to start to offer us their services.\n\nGiven the situation\
  \ was pretty crowded for our clueless mind, we decided to walk to the nearest church\
  \ just to give ourselves a place to sit and figure out about our acitivies. \n\n\
  I started to open the TripAdvisor too see the recommendation about Toraja and found\
  \ recommended driver slash tour guide contact. I gave him a call but turns out he\
  \ was not availabe on that day. However he promised us that he will send his friend\
  \ to pick us at the city center (that looks like more to a village center).\n\n\
  While waiting for his friend to pick us, we saw the cart of traditional chicken\
  \ noodle, that eventually tasted so bad and sour but quite enough to fill my tummy.\n\
  \nIn short we managed to joined two traditional funeral ceremonies and engaged with\
  \ the local. \nWe saw the super mega expensive \"white\" bull as the symbol of power\
  \ and respect to those who died. I heard that the \"white\" bull might cost you\
  \ at the cost of new BMW!\n\nWe even invited to watch the cow fight at their backyard\
  \ on one of Toraja's mountain hills while sipping our traditional alcohol drinks\
  \ made from rice and sipped from the real bamboo. They somehow managed to craved\
  \ the bamboo into simple drinking glass.\n\nThe downside of the trip was we cannot\
  \ find any great taste of foods and drinks; other than their traditional alcohol\
  \ drink. \n\n\nIn short, Toraja is a great place for cultural experience but the\
  \ infrastructure itself has not yet supporting the conveniece of travelling. There\
  \ road was bumpy and dusty. You will find most of the villages cannot be reached\
  \ with vehicle. \nAll those things is still worth the experience of getting to know\
  \ the culture that hold strong Christianity mix with Animism, being stuck with traditionality\
  \ versus the modern world, struggling to have the money to buy the \"white\" bull\
  \ but often feel starved. \nAnd ofcourse the beauty of travelling is to discover\
  \ yourself and create the memories with any special person."
