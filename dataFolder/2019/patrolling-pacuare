Text: "\u201C\xA1Abajo!\u201D a command to get down is whisper-yelled in my ear. It\
  \ is midnight and I am on shift with Elsa, a local guide. We work for a turtle conservation\
  \ project located on Pacuare Beach, south of Costa Rica\u2019s Tortuguero National\
  \ Park. We are on a routine patrol, combing the beach for nesting sea turtles. Our\
  \ goal is to find their eggs before poachers do. \n\nElsa is a petite woman in her\
  \ sixties who is surprisingly fit for her age. She just spotted the signs of a Green\
  \ turtle coming to shore: deep two metre long trails in the sand that could be easily\
  \ mistaken for ATV tracks if ATVs existed on the island. I watch in amazement as\
  \ Elsa inches across my line of sight on all fours, looking like a turtle herself\
  \ with her backpack moonlighting as a carapace. I wait for her signal and imitate\
  \ her crawl in the sand, eventually worming my way next to the mother turtle. \n\
  \nElsa grabs her measuring tape and we move in a frenzy to get the mother\u2019\
  s measurements. I am thrown to the ground when a flipper catches my foot in its\
  \ attempt to dig a nest. I don\u2019t know why I am surprised at the turtle\u2019\
  s strength when its flippers are the size of mini surfboards. We wait for the mother\
  \ to finish digging her nest, enduring the sand whipped in our faces as we watch.\
  \ We see the turtle\u2019s eyes glaze over, an indicator she was entering her birthing\
  \ trance. Elsa quickly pulls out a bag and places it under the mother\u2019s cloaca\
  \ to catch the incoming eggs. \u201CCiento cinco\u2026 ciento seis...\u201D, we\
  \ count one hundred and six golf ball sized eggs through misty eyes. We tag the\
  \ turtle before making our way to the hatchery. \n\nThe eggs are heavy and warm\
  \ in our hands. Elsa and I take turns to relieve our aching arms, sore from cradling\
  \ the bag. We pass a group of poachers halfway to the hatchery. My stomach drops\
  \ seeing the machetes at their waists. We were taught the law of the beach was \u201C\
  whoever gets there first, gets the bounty\u201D. They stare at our eggs before one\
  \ of them nods at Elsa and says something to her in rapid Spanish. Elsa tells me\
  \ the man is her nephew reminding her to bring her laundry in before the forecasted\
  \ rain later that night. Welcome to Pacuare, where the people you work against are\
  \ also your family. This is a community of thirty and the only source of income\
  \ is the illegal egg trade; islanders are either poachers or former poachers turned\
  \ local guides. \n\nAt the hatchery, we give the eggs to other volunteers who bury\
  \ them for incubation. As we wait, I ask Elsa what it was like to grow up in Pacuare.\
  \ She eagerly recounts stories of being a young girl sitting with her father watching\
  \ turtles come ashore every twenty minutes. Now, they come every two or three days.\
  \ Poaching and human activity have decimated sea turtle populations by over eighty\
  \ percent in the last twenty years. Before we bid goodbye, Elsa adds me on Facebook.\
  \ She tells me proudly about her friends from around the world, \u201CTengo amigos\
  \ de Alemania, Jap\xF3n, Francia, todo del mundo!\u201D I become another card in\
  \ her rolodex of international connections. \n\nI stumble back to my moldy bunk\
  \ bed exhausted. It was now three in the morning. The beach is a ten mile obstacle\
  \ course infested with sand fleas, biting crabs, and driftwood-garbage anomalies.\
  \ The locals know the beach like the back of their hand. Us foreigners on the other\
  \ hand, well, I was either falling down sand banks or ignoring the itches from my\
  \ flea bites. The realization dawns on me that the guides do this every night. They\
  \ could choose to be poachers and not go through the extra work of mandatory patrols\
  \ and data collection. However, their love for the turtles they grew up with push\
  \ them to go the extra mile, or in this case ten miles, every night. I fall asleep\
  \ to the sounds of the ocean knowing the mother sea turtle will not be the last\
  \ of her kind."
