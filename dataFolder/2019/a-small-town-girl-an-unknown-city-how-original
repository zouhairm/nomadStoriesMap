Text: "A small town girl, an unknown city. Basically, the beginning description to\
  \ every romantic comedy ever.\nAs the frame pans to the subway, a beautiful girl\
  \ dressed out of place in an overalls dress stumbles up the stairs and into the\
  \ light; squinting her bright green eyes.\n\nThat\u2019s me right there. The green\
  \ eyed, overall wearing, squinting, and confused girl in the middle of the bustling\
  \ streets of New York City.\n\n\tIt was the summer of 2016 and I had left my sheltered\
  \ Hawaii life to practice and perfect the art of contemporary, and ballet in the\
  \ city of art. Attending Joffrey had always been a dream of mine. They are the best\
  \ of the best and that\u2019s where I wanted to be. Much to my surprise the most\
  \ life changing part of that summer was not the improvement in the way I turned\
  \ or leaped, but rather the internal shift that occured when I experience the city,\
  \ and what it meant to possibly be unsafe for the first time in my entire life.\n\
  \n\tAfter 4 weeks in the city, my time began to come to a bittersweet close. I felt\
  \ as though I had conquered the understanding of a place so vast. The subway and\
  \ streets became easy to navigate, the people became bearable. But soon enough,\
  \ in two days I would be getting on a plane and I needed to enjoy the next two days\
  \ in the city.\n\tIt was a perfect sunny Sunday. My three friends and I spent the\
  \ day in central park, riding bikes, and downing a few bottles of champagne until\
  \ the sun set at nine and we hadn\u2019t eaten all day. Gallivanting down the streets\
  \ of New York, we decided to wait for 2 hours for Ellen\u2019s StarDust Diner where\
  \ your waiters are professional singers who deliver your food and drinks while breaking\
  \ out into song and dance -- Sign Me Up!\n\t\nThe food was subpar, but the entertainment\
  \ was extreme. It was an ideal way to end my trip. \n\nBy the time we had finished\
  \ eating after the wait it was midnight. My friends needed to drop me off at the\
  \ dorms where I was staying for my dance school so we headed back down those stairs\
  \ that I once walked up, and into the subway -- and this is where things went downhill.\
  \ We had a beautiful day: our adrenaline was carrying us through the night. We were\
  \ on the subway, speaking and cackling so loud that everyone on the subway was staring\
  \ until we realized we had been on the this underground train for far too long.\
  \ Passing Manhattan we went virtually 45 minutes past our destination and into the\
  \ Bronx. We nervously looked around, without knowing what to do. We got off at the\
  \ next stop and walked out of the subway to grab 4g only to realize all our phones\
  \ had died. Looking around we saw that we were noticeably in the wrong area of town.\
  \ Across the street a KFC filled with people begging for scraps, prostitutes getting\
  \ their fried chicken fix, and rough looking guys kicking it on the 1 am streets.\
  \ It was obvious that we had no idea where we were or if we should be there. We\
  \ sprinted back in the subway looking for someone to help guide us. Multiple subway\
  \ routes were under construction at this late hour we couldn\u2019t find our way\
  \ home. We sat in the subway, some attempting to stay calm while, one cried. \u201C\
  How could a small town, young teenage girl like me have \u201Cconquered\u201D a\
  \ place as intricate as New York City,\u201D I thought to myself.\n\nAfter the help\
  \ from a kind woman we made it back to where I was staying. This humbled my traveling\
  \ experience and allowed me to realize that when in a new place, you  have never\
  \ mastered the tricks of the city until put out of your comfort zone. No matter\
  \ where I have traveled in the world, I now possess a humble perspective that has\
  \ impeded me from encountering dangerous situations, but I am happy to say that,\
  \ just like every romantic comedy, the protagonist gets off scot-free."
