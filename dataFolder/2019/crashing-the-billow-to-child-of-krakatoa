Text: "World knows Krakatoa was a legend. The massive stratovolcano exploded on August,\
  \ 1883 - triggered 40 meters deadly tsunami through West Java and Lampung district.\
  \ \n\nLast December 2018, Tsunami swept back those districts in silence. It was\
  \ presumed to be an aftermath due to Child of Krakatoa volcanic activity. My heart\
  \ was breaking to hear this sad news and shortly I remembered my formidable \u2013\
  \ also dreadful journey to Child of Krakatoa on early March 2015.\n\nI decided to\
  \ go with few friends after we had kept curiosity to the legend \u2013 which more\
  \ than a century ago propelled volcanic ash to 260.000 feet in height, changed the\
  \ weather, thwarted world harvest season, and caused global famine. \n\nWe left\
  \ Jakarta to Merak Port on Friday night by bus. After that, we crossed over Sunda\
  \ Strait to Bakaheuni Port Lampung by ferry. \n\nAs our arrival next early morning,\
  \ we took local transportation to Canti \u2013 a small port where traditional motor\
  \ boat would deliver us to Sebesi Island \u2013 the closest island to Krakatoa,\
  \ once severely struck by eruption and tsunami both in 1883 or December 2018.  \
  \ \n\nOn the boat, we met around 10 tourists heading to Krakatoa. Most of them are\
  \ Indonesian. Few were from India and Netherland. Sky was clear, wind blew normally\
  \ and so did the wave. \n\nBefore caught Sebesi, we had stopped at Sebuku Island,\
  \ our first snorkeling spot. The coral and fishes were lively colorful and the water\
  \ was warm \u2013 caused by magma activity. The second snorkeling spot was Lagoon\
  \ Cabe which had more incredibly beautiful underwater view. \n\nWe reached Sebesi\
  \ on twilight and stayed for a night. Here, soaring 844 meters Sebesi Mountain \u2013\
  \ just few meters distance behind homestay we rent. \n\nEarly morning around 4 AM,\
  \ we had been woken up and soon after, we headed to Child of Krakatoa. Stars sprinkled\
  \ above the sky that morning. So beautiful! \n\nWave and wind looked normal in a\
  \ while. But, less than 2 hours later, a shocking wave shook the boat. I saw my\
  \ friend, Yoan grabbed a girl\u2019s arm who sat near in the boat\u2019s edge. She\
  \ was almost been thrown out to the ocean. \n\nI was little bit calmed down when\
  \ noticed Child of Krakatoa in my sight. Slowly, our boat moved closer to the dock.\
  \ \n\nSands under my hiking sandals felt warm. Similar with the warm ocean water,\
  \ it was caused by magma\u2019s activity. We climbed it through path that surrounded\
  \ by forest and shrubbery. It just needed 1 hour, but the higher we climbed, the\
  \ more sulfuric we smelled. \n\nClosely to the caldera, we found light brown ground\
  \ mixed with gravels and stones. No more trees on the top. Unfortunately, we were\
  \ forbid to reach the caldera edge for safety. Even though, view from the top was\
  \ more beautiful than I had expected before. From 800 Mdpl, we captured sceneries\
  \ of ocean, mountains, islands and clouds at a same time. So marvelous!\n\nUnluckily,\
  \ bad weather had come when we went down and back to the boat. Strong wind blew\
  \ the boat, therefore, we reached it hardly from the beach.\n\nOn the boat, I noticed\
  \ the coming of billow when I had grabbed a life jacket. Soon, our boat was shaken\
  \ off. Dramatically, rain dropped hardly and storm blew wildly. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ how high the billow was, but I remembered it was higher than the boat. \n\nI gazed\
  \ around and found the India girl started to scream. Liters water poured from the\
  \ boat\u2019s window and flooded the cabin. It happened over and over so I thought\
  \ our boat would sink shortly. \n\nThe most frightening moment was when our boat\
  \ had to climb a huge billow and suddenly its machine was stop. In a such gripping\
  \ moment, I thought I would die. Rain didn\u2019t get stop and we trapped to bad\
  \ weather almost 3 or 4 hours, with huge and wild tide until we finally reached\
  \ Sebesi in the afternoon. \n\nUnfortunately, the journey had not ended yet\u2026\
  \ \nWe had to cross over wild ocean from Sebesi to Canti Port, then continue to\
  \ cross over Sunda Strait from Bakaheuni Port Lampung to Merak Port Jakarta. \n\n\
  Gracefully, we returned safely to Jakarta. Thus, I can share this story today."
