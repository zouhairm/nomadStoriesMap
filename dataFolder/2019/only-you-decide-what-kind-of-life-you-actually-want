Text: "Kathmandu is Alive\nDo deeply  Alive. \nKathmandu is a lawless place. It is\
  \ chaos in its purest form with its heavily congested traffic,giant globs of tangled\
  \ wires hanging off telephone poles.\nWhen you walk throught these streets,it doesn't\
  \ matter who you are; status,money or origin wont save you from the chaos, and that\
  \ is why i love Kathmandu- \"it is a lawless place and in that lawlessness,  there\
  \ is ORDER, HUMANITY and RAWNESS.\nNepal is one of my favourite place, the #1 reason\
  \ is the people. This country is real raw, some of the most genuine ,kind and honest\
  \ human I've ever encountered during my travels. They are people who press their\
  \ palm together and bow their heads every time they greet you ( Hello-namaste-meaning\
  \ -the divine light of me bow downs to the divine light within you).\n\nNepal has\
  \ taught me that there is so much magic in this world, in each person  that we encounter,\
  \ and we may not even see it.\n\nBut what if we tried to?\n\nThe best part of this\
  \ magic is that we are all part of it . We all contribute to it. Just pay attention\
  \ and you'll all see.\n\nThe humility,piety and kindness of people revieved my faith\
  \ in humanity."
