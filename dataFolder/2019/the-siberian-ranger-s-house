Text: "I can hear my tired breath. I feel the cold sweat running down my back. Even\
  \ though I am sweaty and my cheeks are all red. I have some sort of weird sensation\
  \ of cold \u2013 it\u2019s not because of all the walking, it\u2019s more because\
  \ of the cutting wind that blows straight into to my face, hurting me. \nWe\u2019\
  re already walking for 8-9 km, I think we left the village 4-5 hours ago. But here\
  \ you cannot count the time and distances in usual parameters. The secluded scenery\
  \ of the western shore of Lake Baikal it\u2019s a rocky zigzag, with just a few\
  \ plain areas. Therefore, it mostly takes you up and down the hill, closer to the\
  \ water and then further in the land, making it difficult to have any landmarks.\n\
  The wind becomes harsher and keeps the forest and the lake in a continuous tremble.\
  \ Looking at the lake I can see that the wind pushes big chunks of ice to the shore.\
  \ Because of the pressure, the chunks shatter into billions of crystals and transform\
  \ in icy waves, changing shape continuously. I have never seen or hear anything\
  \ like it. The sound of wind and breaking ice it\u2019s both weird and addictive.\
  \ It keeps me in awe.\nAnd there is something more - the noise of emptiness - you\
  \ would say that in an isolated place like this, you would find your peace and quiet.\
  \ Isolated yes, quiet no. Even though there are so many noises around me, they all\
  \ scream emptiness, isolation. As I realize this, I become aware that I find myself\
  \ in the wilderness, in the most secluded place I\u2019ve ever been to.\nHaving\
  \ this in mind, I try to keep my focus until we get to our destination, which I\
  \ don\u2019t really know where it is. I ask Valera about our destination and he\
  \ tells me we will be there in half an hour and he will make me a tea from the leaves\
  \ and plants he just finished picking. He is a biologist and tour guide around Baikal\
  \ since the 80\u2019s. Sometimes he walks like now, sometimes he skis or skates,\
  \ depending on the season. \nIndeed, after half an hour, we\u2019re here. It\u2019\
  s the dry valley of a spring, the starting point of the Russian gold rush. About\
  \ one hundred years ago, some gold nuggets were accidentally discovered in the spring\
  \ and people started rushing to this place in search for treasures.\nValera started\
  \ preparing our lunch while telling local stories from the gold rush time. At some\
  \ point, as if he sensed my need to get a bit warmer, he started telling me that\
  \ in the summer, tourists can rent horses from a ranger and his wife and do tours\
  \ around the area. I wasn\u2019t paying too much attention at the moment. Because\
  \ of the cold and the hunger I was a bit irritated so I continued eating. Soon after,\
  \ as I was regaining my better social self, I saw Valera showing me something in\
  \ the opposite direction from where we came, while still talking about the ranger\
  \ and his wife. Now, feeling surprised, because I thought they were living in Bolshie\
  \ Koty, the village where we came from, I raised my eyes and looked in the direction\
  \ that Valera was pointing. As I cannot see without my glasses, I took the camera\
  \ and zoomed in to figure out what this man was trying to show me.\nI could see\
  \ in the distance, the Siberian ranger\u2019s house. They live 20-25 km away from\
  \ the next human settlement. They don\u2019t have kids. In the summer, the ranger\
  \ and his wife rent horses for the tourists. Other than that, they just live their\
  \ life in between the lake and the forest.\nToday it\u2019s Easter, the first one\
  \ away from my family. On my way back to the village, I can\u2019t stop thinking\
  \ that maybe it was just me the one who perceived this place as the most isolated\
  \ place on earth. That even if they were living in the harshest wilderness that\
  \ I ever saw, these people never felt this way. It\u2019s their home. And now I\
  \ feel like it\u2019s mine as well."
