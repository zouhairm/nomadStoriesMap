Text: "Travel is always experiential ,and no one learns from other people\u2019s experiences.There\
  \ is hardly anyone without \u201Cwanderlust\u201Don their Instagram bios nowadays.Travelling\
  \ has become a new lifestyle indeed.Bollywood films as the world knows are larger\
  \ than life,extravagant.This is the \u201CYOLO\u201D  Life, you only live once ,and\
  \ out of major \u201CFOMO\u201D(fear of missing out),we yearn for this particular\
  \ lifestyle .Everyone after watching the \u201CTomatina festival\u201Din this particular\
  \ bollywood movie\u201DZindagi na milegi dobara\u201D,dreamed to be jumping into\
  \ the hoard of tomatoes and painting the town red  apparently.So when I got a chance\
  \ to plan a trip to experience the La Tomatina ,I was excited beyond measures.I\
  \ could almost picture my self dancing ,humming,\u201DOo Aa ,Take the world and\
  \ paint it red\u201D.This was my first experience travelling solo with a group of\
  \ strangers, which is completely oppugnant to my personality .We left for Bu\xF1\
  ol, outside the city of Valencia,during the early hours ,reaching beforehand because\
  \ this is a crowded affair and everyone is briefed about the basic Do\u2019s and\
  \ Don\u2019ts ,also served sangrias, staple for spain.People assemble in the streets\
  \ of Bu\xF1ol, everyone in white ensemble as per the theme for the \u201CWorld\u2019\
  s biggest food fight\u201D.Everyones in high spirit and all ready for WAR, just\
  \ kidding .A long wait in an utterly crowded street for huge trucks filled with\
  \ tonnes of tomatoes to pass through.There are portable washrooms arranged ,a little\
  \ distance from the area where the actual food fight takes place , with really long\
  \ waiting lines, you can imagine after drinking all that sangria.The crowd dancing\
  \ ,bustling with people of diverse originalities ,everyone excited about the forthcoming\
  \ tomato fiesta .I mean imagine you get to throw tomatoes on each other for no rhyme\
  \ or reason ,sounds fun eh! With the canon fire ,trucks start entering within the\
  \ streets ,fluttering streets make way for the trucks to pass, they came in creating\
  \ a lot of buzz and anticipation among the people.There are people divided on either\
  \ sides ,assuming these are the two teams ,no changing sides now .The minute the\
  \ first tomato hits you ,ouch !that hurts ,disclaimer:please squeeze the tomato\
  \ before throwing them on others.A never ending war starts between the two sides\
  \ ,plunging tomatoes everywhere.Crazy atmosphere, catching tomatoes being thrown\
  \ from the truck ,picking the  ones from the ground .Anyone will get a whiff of\
  \ tomatoes for sure.Truck after truck ,huge ones ,passing one by one ,crowd engrossed\
  \ in the fight of a lifetime, rolling on floor of the streets, laughing ,having\
  \ the time of their lives.As soon as the trucks have passed away ,everyone is drenched\
  \ from head to toe in nothing but tomatoes, streets are filled with them ,people\
  \ are covered in them,It is a true tomato extravaganza for sure.I was now waiting\
  \ for the trucks with water pipes to come as I had seen earlier in that movie which\
  \ inspired me to come and experience this all together, but here\u2019s the catch\
  \ ,those were only depicted in the movie.Basically after the whole food fight ,you\
  \ are literally drenched in tomatoes but to get back to your hotels ,everyone had\
  \ to ride the bus back.The bus won\u2019t let you enter all dirty ,the only way\
  \ to remove the tomatoes from your bodies are the hoses provided by the locals ,which\
  \ of course have long lines because of the assemblage.Or people can go to the Bu\xF1\
  ol river ,but as we had time deadlines to reach the bus ,it would not have been\
  \ possible .I thought that was a bit of a task right there,to be honest .Standing\
  \ in lines, fearing the bus might leave you if you don\u2019t turn up on time,I\
  \ didn\u2019t even have my cell phone ,that I could contact someone, plus your eyes\
  \ will be stinging for hours after due to all the citrus acid in the tomatoes, felt\
  \ such a sigh of relief once I got on to that bus.The real labour starts after you\
  \ reach the hotel ,when you have to get that whole tomato gunk out of your hair\
  \ ,that can take days even ,joking.Though I had to go to a local salon to get it\
  \ thoroughly cleansed .Nobody can roam around with bits of tomato stranding from\
  \ their hair ,that would be just gross."
