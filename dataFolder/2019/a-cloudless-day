Text: "It was a cloudless day in Naama Bay. \nAfter the long and tiring summer work\
  \ we decided that we could afford a trip like we never did. We were travelers and\
  \ not tourists. \nWe really were.\nSo\u2026 we had already swum with the dolphin,\
  \ we had plucked from the sellers of fragrant essences, we had unwillingly participated\
  \ in the tourist village to bocce competitions, to the game of the apple in the\
  \ bucket and to group dances.\nWe had to take a day out of the fun tunnel. \nSo\
  \ a taxi driver with a scar all along a cheek  and that drove a sort of very large\
  \ brown Cadillac  tell us that would have brought us a hundred km towards our destination\
  \ and would have waited all day for us to do our visit tour. \nIt was a cloudless\
  \ day even in Dahab. \nWe had left quietly in a sunny place after lunch along the\
  \ Sinai desert, leaving behind the monastery of Santa Caterina at the mountain of\
  \ the burning bush. We were twenty and more devoted to fun than to religious culture.\n\
  We were in Dahab in the afternoon. Finally, no big resorts, only buildings in harmony\
  \ with the harsh and essential nature that housed them: the managers of the various\
  \ businesses thought to color with cushions and carpets the space that would have\
  \ welcomed you for a tea, a narghile or a meal.\nEverything was really restful and\
  \ we were melancholy to think that our holiday would end there, that we would have\
  \ the flight the next morning and for the fact that there we felt so comfortable\
  \ and we had only discovered the last night of our Red Sea.\nThe sun had already\
  \ begun to descend and in the light of the street lamps we looked calmly for the\
  \ restaurant for dinner when we began to whiz to the side people running like chased.\
  \ At first we thought of a theft but when the street lamps went out suddenly we\
  \ started to look around us, attracted by a waterfall noise. It took me a while\
  \ to mentally realize what I saw: there was like a wave three meters high that was\
  \ thrown into the sea from the road from which we had arrived at the sea. All the\
  \ roads we had seen had become rivers.\nWe had water at the ankles but looking for\
  \ the road to reach the meeting place with our scarred driver we noticed that the\
  \ level was rising. Tourists were as if swallowed by this absurdity was screaming\
  \ in several languages not because there was a real danger of life but it was difficult\
  \ to walk to meet and get together because the water always higher now also had\
  \ some current strength was cold full of stones and it came to an adult's waist.\
  \ The locals instead lived the event as if it were a carnival and were amused but\
  \ also prepared. A local lady told us that they knew that on the mountain that was\
  \ hollow, it had rained and that the crater would overflow. So as it happened only\
  \ four years ago they had taken everything away and had their houses cleaned by\
  \ the force of the waterfall.\nThis made us smile less when we asked how long this\
  \ carnival would last ... she replied that she could not know the last time it was\
  \ three days\u2026 and we had the flight to Italy at ten... the next morning. We\
  \ left our Cassandra trying to find the way to the taxi. We ended up on a small\
  \ hill with a small donkey. The situation did not improve until we heard the sound\
  \ of an off-road vehicle picking up derelicts like us who were not heading. We said\
  \ goodbye to the donkey and a little worried about him we got on the off-road vehicle.\
  \ It was honest, I do not know how he managed to transport us from the taxi driver\
  \ who was quiet to the dry and professionally at our disposal despite the three\
  \ hours of delay on the roadmap.\nWhen we were on the return plane we felt a little\
  \ sorry that we had not been forced to stay."
