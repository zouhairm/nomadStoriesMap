Text: "My soul has always been one who craves the natural world \u2013 listening in\
  \ on conversations whispered between swaying trees; or being able to sink endlessly\
  \ through miles of toasted sand. So, when I discovered a city bustling not only\
  \ with metropolitan life but also the buzz of nature, my heart was captivated. Vancouver\
  \ is a treasure chest conglomeration of mountains, woodland, little beaches, yet\
  \ also city skyscrapers.\n\u201CThe City of Glass!\u201D Our tour guide had pronounced,\
  \ his mop of curls proudly bouncing as he swept an arm across the glistening buildings\
  \ reflecting vivid greens and blues.\nIf you were to ask me one location which particularly\
  \ stood out to me \u2013 a park may be deemed an odd response at first. Surely,\
  \ I could pick out something far more spectacular than simply some park? \nStanley\
  \ Park, however, is different. Constructed from such dense forestry and surrounded\
  \ by the sea front, it feels as though it is its own little escape into wildlife.\
  \ Although filled with plenty of the same amenities as most urban parks, something\
  \ about the layers of trees and frosting of lakes and wild animals is a location\
  \ that seamlessly allows time to fly by. \nNeedless to say, (in between day trips\
  \ and visits to local restaurants) we soon became frequent visitors. It is no longer\
  \ countable on how many occasions we heaved ourselves to stand \u2013 after stuffing\
  \ ourselves with a year supply of Tim Hortons\u2019 donuts \u2013 to pay a visit.\
  \ My mum, in particular, had become rather infatuated with the raccoons plodding\
  \ freely along the lakesides. \nAside from the nature within the downtown area itself,\
  \ we also caught the public transport to the mountainous hiking trails further north:\
  \ specifically, Lynn Canyon Park. Having flown into Canada from a place where the\
  \ skies are constantly grey, and the closest to nature you can get are some farmers\u2019\
  \ fields in the outskirts of the town \u2013 this was a drastically different world.\
  \ Glacier rivers and rockpools; trees climbing the hills for miles; mountainous\
  \ rocks endlessly flowing up and up and up\u2026 it was quite surreal that such\
  \ a place existed just a short bus ride from the city center.  \nDespite the touristy\
  \ appeal of the suspension bridges and mapped hiking trails (which we did visit\
  \ in the quieter hours of the morning before it became swarmed with visitors) we\
  \ ended up hiking the little side-trails, and followed the trickling sounds of flowing\
  \ water beckoning us to a rock pool we later discovered to be marked out as the\
  \ \u201930 foot pool\u2019 on the entrance\u2019s map. We laughed at the hikers\
  \ dunking their bodies in the crystal glacier water and screeching at the cold,\
  \ but soon ended up joining them \u2013 our yelling reflecting the Canadian geese\
  \ who inhabited the area. \nWhile perched atop one of the smooth rocks, munching\
  \ on the packet of mixed nuts we picked up from 7-Eleven, I found myself drifting\
  \ away. Basking in the sunlight, gentle and comforting on my skin, and watching\
  \ the rippling water; the forest offered a calm that nowhere else could match. \n\
  Oddly, after returning to Downtown Vancouver later that afternoon, I didn\u2019\
  t feel as though I had left the natural world. I craned my neck to watch the skyscrapers\
  \ as my tired legs carried me past them and saw not a dirt-stained city but once\
  \ again the colours reflected there: blues of the sky, and green of the trees. The\
  \ city breathes the same air as the nature that surrounds it: inhaling and exhaling\
  \ untainted air.   \nCities may be toxic and infected; a reflection of humanity\u2019\
  s destruction. But this one is not. Vancouver does not reflect the toxicity of mankind\
  \ and the infection of pollution, but instead the unprocessed craftsmanship of mother\
  \ nature. Here, I could seamlessly breathe fresh air."
