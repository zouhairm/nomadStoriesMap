Text: "Sven got on board and stood on the deck of a city that did not look as nice\
  \ as its streets. Night was falling silent and the stars were all brighter, blew\
  \ a cold wind, only to hear the hum of the engine, which is more foam drifted off\
  \ to sleep. People hung over and sleepy lay down all over the place from the stairs\
  \ to the bars, room watching television, the ship\u2019s decks and space with lift.\
  \ The bar was reached, light music. Nobody moved, only the ship\u2019s ladies heralded\
  \ very long and sleepless solar eclipse. The sounds of the saxophone and synthesizer\
  \ sounds kitschy unknown players were held awake atmosphere, dimmed lights and lamps\
  \ painted the intimacy between couples lost in the vastness of the blue.\nSven was\
  \ away from all that, smoking his cigarette-holder, as he pondered what to do next,\
  \ were waiting for him and a desert mirage together. He ignored what was left behind.\
  \ He lived in was launched to sea without a message in a bottle or a letter with\
  \ post script, without a word and deeds. He bought his paintings torn from the album\
  \ which I filled in choosing only landscapes. He put his image on the hidden place\
  \ you might ever need him when he gets a better time. It\u2019s full of. Albums\
  \ are better as they get older and images that he collected have not faded so all\
  \ you had to remove dust from them and revive and give new clothes and paintings\
  \ captured the icebergs below the surface. Midnight is moved away long ago, Sven\
  \ flipped his painted landscapes, hoping for at least a fraction of this motif.\
  \ He quickly dozed off on the ship\u2019s bench. He woke up when the ship was already\
  \ in the port.\nHe got up around 9,30 a.m, hastily washed his face, not the best\
  \ yet awake. Nothing breakfast as usual sat on the bed and let the synapse back\
  \ routine. He began writing the presentation, failed to go to where it should take\
  \ a computer desk. So wrote until four o\u2019clock and completely broke after which\
  \ he came to meet with an acquaintance from France who was traveling. Since it was\
  \ broken, and she was not exactly to communicate everything turned out badly, sat\
  \ twenty minutes, it seemed that the little lost like all Frenchmen who met her,\
  \ I could be wrong, but the way to deal with its own decadence has good outlines.\n\
  On it was over then went briefly surfed the Internet, of which he exhausted more,\
  \ the way he ate with the Albanian who thought he was a stranger, he wandered around\
  \ town and came home. He began to draw in paint, hoped to finish this story."
