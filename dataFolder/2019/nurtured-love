Text: "After embracing 1,5 hour-long traffic crawl heading north into the lush, green\
  \ parts of Denpasar. I was welcomed into his beautiful duplex which overlooked the\
  \ closeby fields. Served some coconut water and the most divine vegan coconut flapjacks,\
  \ I mingled with the mother and daughter fellow guests, an adorable pair from Australia\
  \ vacationing Bali for the next two months. Two months? Yes, honey - and I was within\
  \ my feels about that time in paradise. The coconut oil workshop was 2 hours of\
  \ mild labour: grating, sieving and boiling coconut pulp amidst conversation and\
  \ connection. \n\nStep by step we ground, grated and kneaded coconut. Each process\
  \ revealed the assumed evolution of nature. While we nurtured this plant, which\
  \ coincidentally take 8 months for the real coconut to release the best version\
  \ of itself, for you and I. Zaintiar explained the many ways to use and change and\
  \ enjoy coconut, in oil, balm, scent, food and life form. I learned  about the unending\
  \ possibility of nature. I had to be so patient, so so so patient with myself while\
  \ anticipating the end of this process a Balinese coconut oil that smelled euphoric!\
  \ It was a relaxing experience, a memory and huge gift.\n\nWe joked about cultural\
  \ differences of humour, kindness and communication between Balinese and the diverse\
  \ visitors, explorers and \u2018searchers\u2019 that would visit months at a time,\
  \ to connect, create and love. Zaintiar and I shared the many dynamics of being\
  \ a working millennial, the awareness of community and the how\u2019s of creating\
  \ opportunity for ourselves, and others. \n\nAs I looked outside the ricefield as\
  \ the breeze shifted the grass from left to right; I caught a peek into the possibility\
  \ of how infinite life could be."
