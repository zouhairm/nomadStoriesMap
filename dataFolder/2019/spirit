Text: "Sitting together trying to map out a holiday, myself and three friends were\
  \ a bit stuck. Mindlessly yelling out cool or familiar destinations was getting\
  \ us nowhere. We were sick of researching every place that sounded remotely viable\
  \ and couldn't help but think we were ruining the beautiful of these destinations\
  \ by seeing photographs of them before we experienced them in real life. So, we\
  \ made a decision: we'd book the best airfares we could find on Skyscanner and no\
  \ one was allowed to research the place beforehand. No pictures from Instagram,\
  \ no group chats saying 'we have to go and see this', no information at all. We\
  \ were going in blind and excitedly booked our trip to Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu.\
  \ \n\nFlash forward a few short weeks and we had arrived at Santo. Throwing our\
  \ luggage into the back of a ute and then ourselves, we held on while our local\
  \ driver showed us his home. As we were driving along, we passed a few men walking\
  \ on foot towards the town centre. As we gawked at the beautiful country we'd found\
  \ ourselves in, they waved to us with brimming smiles. We quickly waved back and\
  \ mentioned how nice a gesture that was and how lovely those men were. We soon realised\
  \ that every local in Santo waves to every other person they see. Their friend down\
  \ the street, a small baby in a pram, four tourists lost from their hostel. Everyone\
  \ beams happiness and excitedly greets one another. \n\nRealising this, we couldn't\
  \ wait to get involved. We started to learn the language and made it our mission\
  \ to connect with as many people as possible. We travelled far away to Port Orly\
  \ to a tucked away treehouse and met the owner, Ang\xE9lique. She showed us her\
  \ haven and introduced us to other travellers and her local community. We found\
  \ ourselves sitting around a table playing cards with ten others from around the\
  \ world, laughing the night away. \n\nSomewhere in the midst of meeting these incredible\
  \ people, we were beginning to also see Santo for all it had to offer. I've lived\
  \ in Australia my whole life, a country known for its beautiful beaches, and nothing\
  \ compared to Santo. Untouched, hidden and completely deserted beaches that were\
  \ full of coral, turtles and fish. We travelled by speed boat with a local resort\
  \ owner to their nearby island and spent the day paddle boarding with turtles. We\
  \ helped the local community set up for a Christmas event they were putting on for\
  \ the children. We dove into blue holes that were so clear they looked just metres\
  \ deep, only to discover the bottom was unreachable with a mere snorkel. We bomb\
  \ dived into lagoons, \n\nAll mapped, planned and executed through the knowledge\
  \ and trust of locals. We lept head first towards the unknown and embraced it for\
  \ everything it was offering us. I watched Vanuatu materialise in front of me, unspoilt\
  \ of expectations and preconceived ideas. I ate omelettes at a cafe recommended\
  \ by our hostel staff, I swam one-hundred metres from shore after a local told me\
  \ that's where the shipwreck was the most beautiful, I got into the back of a bus\
  \ on its way to nowhere and hoped for the best. We trekked through jungles and rode\
  \ quad bikes at the top of mountains. We experienced the best of Vanuatu because\
  \ we allowed ourselves to experience it through the local communities. \n\nAs an\
  \ avid planner, someone with an itinerary and a clear image of what my trip will\
  \ look like - this trip made me nervous. I used to think I loved planning because\
  \ it ensured I wouldn't waste a minute while I was there. What it was really doing\
  \ was spoiling parts of it and taking some of the magic away. The bliss you feel\
  \ when you arrive at a destination that never in your wildest dreams could you imagine\
  \ existed - that's something different. That's another world of travelling. That's\
  \ where the true magic lies, and you only get to experience it if you take that\
  \ leap. If you leap into the unknown."
