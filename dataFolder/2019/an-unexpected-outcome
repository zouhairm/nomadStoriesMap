Text: "Everyone enjoys a vacation, the ability to get away from the day to day routine\
  \ to have a new experience. These experiences can teach us a lot, about other cultures,\
  \ but also about ourselves.  Travel can push us outside our comfort zones to have\
  \ experiences that challenge our preconceptions and give us new perspectives. My\
  \ first visit to Europe was a jump into the unknown and the experience gave me a\
  \ perspective I could not imagine. \nMy first trip to Europe I visited Austria.\
  \ I was apprehensive and self conscious to visit a country where I was not fluent\
  \ in the local language. I was concerned of not being able to get around or being\
  \ seen as disrespectful by needing to conduct conversations in English. I learned\
  \ basic German phrases before leaving, but I anxiously clung to my German English\
  \ dictionary. \nAfter staying mostly to myself, on my second day in Austria I visited\
  \ the small town of Melk and toured Melk Abbey. Late in the day during this excursion\
  \ I encountered a couple who very rapidly asked me \u201CIst der Gesch\xE4ft ge\xF6\
  ffnet? \u201C  In my simple German I apologized and said I did not understand, my\
  \ German was not very good. They told me \u201CNein nein nicht schlecht.\u201C That\
  \ I understood as \u201CNo not bad\u201C and they asked me the same question again.\
  \ After going back and forth and not getting anywhere with the conversation a young\
  \ man approached and asked if I spoke English,  I said I did, and he told me they\
  \ were asking if the abbey shop was open. Ah at last I knew what had been asked!\
  \  I told him it was not open and I had not understood what they were asking. He\
  \ asked if I was an American and I told him I was.  He very politely replied \u201C\
  Well that makes sense why you only know one language.\u201C  Touche, as Americans,\
  \ it seems to be our culture to have everyone accommodate us.  I vowed then to attempt\
  \ the beginnings of all my conversations in German. \nThree days later I found myself\
  \ in Salzburg touring the Hohensalzburg fortress overlooking the magnificent Baroque\
  \ Old Town. In the Golden Hall, I was admiring the coffered ceiling and spiral fluted\
  \ marble columns. As I was preparing to leave I noticed a guide for the fortress\
  \ on the opposite side of the room, this I thought would be an excellent time to\
  \ strike up a conversation in German. I walked over and asked how old the room was\
  \ and I vaguely understood the response as five hundred and some odd years. We spoke\
  \ a little more in German before the guide then dove into a more in depth description\
  \ and I had to apologize and tell them my German was not very good. They immediately\
  \ switched to English. This was not wholly unexpected in a tourist attraction but\
  \ I was happy that I had attempted my question in German first. We continued to\
  \ talk about the fortress and how old it was and the different additions that had\
  \ occurred since construction began in 1077.   \nAt this point I should explain\
  \ that when I went on this trip I was a professional structural engineer, and while\
  \ I had a great job I was not happy. It was talking to this guide that turned out\
  \ to be my ah ha moment. It took traveling more than 5,000 miles and being taken\
  \ out of my comfort zone to realize I could change my career to something I was\
  \ more passionate about. This travel experience for me was one of the most influential\
  \ of my life in that it caused me to change the direction of my life more than any\
  \ other single experience to that point. I came back home and within two weeks had\
  \ given my one month notice at my engineering job. Today I work in a museum, absolutely\
  \ love it, and aspire to a job that combines history and travel and helps other\
  \ people get outside their comfort zones to have transformative experiences while\
  \ traveling."
