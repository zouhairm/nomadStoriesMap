Text: "One of the most liberating things about travel is; listening to, and, hearing\
  \ other travellers regale tales of incredible discoveries, and unique experiences\
  \ from the road, in turn inspiring you to go on, hatch a plan, catching yourself\
  \ an opportunity to go explore some of the magic they painted for you. \nThis story\
  \ is of one of those moments, and how it paid off for me and my travel buddy. We\
  \ were spun an idyllic tale of swaying in a hammock, on top of a Volcano in El Salvador,\
  \ under the cover of a million stars, awakening to the most breath-taking sunrise.\n\
  We set our sights on this Volcano Conchagua, and its fairy tale sunrise. Standing\
  \ at 1,242 meters tall, it looks out over the Gulf of Fonseca, home to a collection\
  \ of various small islands, encompassing views of Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador\
  \ in one vista.\nTransport to the top was; what could only be described as an old\
  \ cattle truck. A domed open wire frame, ropes hung, tied and knotted from same;\
  \ choosing a rope, we braced for the bumpy journey up hill. The views glimpsed between\
  \ clearings and moments of concentration to avoid branch whippings were spectacular.\
  \ \nAt the top wind had picked up considerably, we were shown to an empty unfinished\
  \ restaurant, and it was suggested we sleep there. Unfortunately the weather continued\
  \ to turn, and with no windows or properly secured doors, the winds howled, ripping\
  \ through the restaurant. Without sleeping-bags we were clearly under prepared.\
  \ \nGone was our vision of a calm, balmy night dozing in a hammock, occasionally\
  \ gazing up at a canopy of a billion stars. On taking our last bathroom break before\
  \ properly bedding down, we were met with several parked 4x4\u2019s and the most\
  \ warm and welcoming of greetings. A small group of El Salvadorians had driven from\
  \ San Salvador to camp for the night, part of a hiking group that met at weekends\
  \ to hike volcanos all around El Salvador, and Central America. \nThey informed\
  \ us, a freak weather front had come in from the States. When we told them of our\
  \ under prepared situation, they offered a half covered truck bed for us to sleep\
  \ in. This is what turned out to be our saving grace. \nReturning to the restaurant,\
  \ and our icy tiled layer, we huddled as best we could, bony hips met with hard\
  \ tiles, padded bottoms grown numb. To the truck-bed we went.  Crawling into the\
  \ compact space we were instantly relieved by the wind cover.\nEarly morning brought\
  \ calmed winds; we were beckoned for the first tendrils of sunrise. \u2018Girls\
  \ it\u2019s starting\u2019, stiffly we climbed out, met with the offer of a warm\
  \ sleeping bag. With sleepy heads, and puffy eyes, quietly we padded across to the\
  \ viewing area, and picked our viewing spots.\nBlack horizon turning a dirty grey\
  \ orange, to cobalt blue and burnt, firey tones, the rest of the sky remaining inky,\
  \ stars still twinkling bright. Oranges turned to powder pink and cerise. The sun\
  \ began to shine its golden glow upon us. Each and every second being different,\
  \ never stopping to hit you right in the chest. How it lit up every cell in our\
  \ bodies with the acknowledgement of how truly incredible it is that this happens\
  \ every, single, day. \nWe lolled on rocks, ate breakfast, drank coffee and relished\
  \ our time on Conchagua together. Exchanging stories, this Volcano had brought us\
  \ all together, from such different parts of the world, with diverse life experiences\
  \ and stories. Hitting home we were all human, in search of, and, or trying to maintain\
  \ our inner peace by connecting back to our earth, and in turn, each other.\nLater\
  \ in our trip we managed to connect again; climbing Volcano Santa Ana with some\
  \ of the group.  This honest, pure, human connection we had encountered on Conchagua\
  \ made not only our first sunrise of Central America so special, but our time in\
  \ El Salvador one that we will hold onto for a very long time to come. \nAnyone\
  \ visiting El Salvador should add this into their time budget. It is worth spending\
  \ a piece of it here to catch a sunrise."
