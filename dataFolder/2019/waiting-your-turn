Text: "Last week at this time, I was shivering on a litter-covered sidewalk in Red\
  \ Hook, Brooklyn. Wrapped in blankets and scarves, I waited in line for six hours\
  \ surrounded by hundreds of heavy-set, bearish men, each of us (except me and a\
  \ couple close friends) waiting for the release of a new craft beer.\n\nHours earlier,\
  \ before I found myself despising my awful judgement in that never-ending queue,\
  \ a friend had seen an ad on craigslist to help some beer enthusiast wait in line\
  \ with him all night so he could buy as much beer as was allowed. Each person in\
  \ line could buy only five cases, and he paid us to wait with him so that he could\
  \ buy fifteen more cases. \u201CEasy money - all you have to do is stand in line,\u201D\
  \ the ad read.\n\nWe arrived at 4am. Concerts of men camouflaged the sidewalks.\
  \ They were partying- huddled in intimate circles, drinking the beer they stayed\
  \ up all night last week waiting for. A sea of football jerseys, long beards, solo\
  \ cups, and unused lawn chairs garnished the streets for blocks. I stood hunched\
  \ over with my butt touching the brick wall, occasionally breaking the lingering\
  \ eye contact I\u2019d been making with my feet to look up at my friends. While\
  \ everyone celebrated the release of this limited edition beer, we looked like we\
  \ just arrived off the boat at Ellis Island.\n\nTwo days later my feet marinated\
  \ in the sun over 4000 miles from that sullied street in Brooklyn. I\u2019d be surrounded\
  \ by as many bodies, but here I'd sit and I\u2019d watch more graceful people sip\
  \ espressos and inspect white lilies from a flower stand that made even a foreigner\
  \ feel at home under it\u2019s awning.\n\nI was in the center of Padua, Italy, leaning\
  \ on a stone wall while sitting on a stool, considering another culture\u2019s version\
  \ of leisure.\n\nInside Piazza delle Erbe, the distance from home felt emotionally\
  \ further than the miles that stretched across the Atlantic. I\u2019d wiggle on\
  \ my stool just a bit to align to its groove, and I\u2019d settle in.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\
  \nToday marks a week since I\u2019ve been in Italy. The rustic house, the varicolored\
  \ buildings that stand more confident than those back home, and the pace of life\
  \ that saunters around these Romanesque structures have all made my transition seamless.\
  \ No jet lag, no homesickness. I take the bus now, I eat dinner late now, I take\
  \ care of two children who barely understand the words I say now.\n\nOn my first\
  \ morning here, an hour before I found myself giddy at the perimeter of Piazza delle\
  \ Erbe, I dropped off Alessandro and Ingrid at school. As I left the school, two\
  \ fathers, \_both whom seemed dressed for work, asked (in Italian) if I\u2019d like\
  \ to grab a cappuccino quickly. The coffee bar was thirty meters away.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s hard not to immediately recollect an image of any school drop-off from my childhood.\
  \ Bumper to bumper in a parking lot, horns honking at forgetful kids reminding them\
  \ to come back and retrieve their lunch, hearing the words come from every direction,\
  \ \u201Cyou\u2019re gonna be late.\u201D\n\nAlessandro and Ingrid hug me goodbye,\
  \ I\u2019ve known them for ten hours, and then two men, clearly observant enough\
  \ to recognize I am new, ask me to join them for coffee.\_I often romanticize places\
  \ when I first arrive, but Italy gave me no choice. It didn't matter that they didn't\
  \ talk to me once we got there because I speak hardly any Italian and that they\
  \ probably won't invite me again, because I didn't understand them either. It was\
  \ the cadence of things I loved; the undemanding pace of their step contrasted with\
  \ the sharp speed of their hands as they spoke.\n\nOn the horizon a trip to Bologna.\
  \ I\u2019m on the train headed that way now and when I think about waiting on that\
  \ sidewalk in Brooklyn it is easy to realize that this is what I was waiting for;\
  \ this adventure, this perspective, this train ride. As it would have it, I spent\
  \ the money made that night \_on this Bolognan adventure. Somethings are worth waiting\
  \ for, no matter how cold."
