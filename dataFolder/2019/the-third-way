Text: "If you peel back your identity, how many layers do you have, how many lives\n\
  have you lived? Rome was built, burned, and reborn\u2014 its empire waning and waxing\
  \ with 35,893 moons. I embarked on my voyage to Rome knowing that I would miss two\
  \ full moons, five best-friends and infinite possibilities associated with things\
  \ real, semi-real and not-real in Seattle. Yet in order to grow as not only an artist,\
  \ but into my \u2018authentic\u2019 self, I would have to enter into the gateway\
  \ between past and present: the inbetween. \n\nRome survives through it\u2019s conversation\
  \ with itself, the intersections between time periods where voices collide into\
  \ a third way of thought. In Rome, I was both the actor and observer holding conversations\
  \ with the art around me, its residents and my own thoughts. San Clemente taught\
  \ me the importance of time travel\u2014taking a simple step on a staircase meant\
  \ a leap into a different strata. While I mined for details in the marble, hidden\
  \ codes in tricolor mosaics revealed mysteries lodged between medieval brick. I\
  \ was undergoing transmutation: art was acting as alchemy. I started to ask walls\
  \ their stories and they began to whisper back, asking about my history. Like a\
  \ child uttering its own name for the first time, I was finding my voice through\
  \ writing. Poetry became my alchemical art:it required me to dissolve and shed my\
  \ old patterns and forms.\n\n\u201CI am not a black artist, I am an artist.\u201D\
  \ \n\nBasquiat stated in an interview that he wanted to be known for the brilliance\
  \ of his work and not his physical identity. He wanted to defy boundaries and limitations,\
  \ in not only his transition from being a graffiti artist into a renowned painter,\
  \ but as a creative of color. Being an African American artist, especially a woman,\
  \ colors not only the work I produce, but the life I live. I am constantly trying\
  \ to find the threshold where I can speak my truth, express my emotions and have\
  \ them be respected, instead of commodified. Traveling and living abroad as a Black\
  \ woman was both empowering and isolating. There were times where I was praised\
  \ for my differences and fruitfulness that my experiences bring. However, the moments\
  \ where stares became whispers and empty seats were shifted to for no reason were\
  \ not ignored. Instead, I found a series of truths: \n\nAlways keep writing\nWrite\
  \ through the pain \nWrite to release yourself from societal shackles and encourage\
  \ others to do the same\n\nOne of the most impactful historical sites I visited\
  \ was my first, the Pantheon. I was completely taken back by its age and size --nothing\
  \ is modest in Rome. Yet the real focus was revealed inside, the oculus. Writers\
  \ are always looking through a lens, adjusting one\u2019s aperture to fit the tale;\
  \ perspective is inherent in any story. In my writing, I started to incorporate\
  \ different voices to challenge the dangers of a single narrative. I aimed to create\
  \ a third voice by merging different worlds much like present Rome, which rests\
  \ on interwoven echoes of its past. \n\nRoman Graffiti also became a huge inspiration\
  \ for my work. I started to look at\nthe various tags, and pieces in conversation\
  \ with one another. Each piece is a voice of the present, a representation of the\
  \ ideologies of the people. People use graffiti to make a stand, to create a cultural\
  \ memory. From encouraging people to be \u201Cgood in love\u201D or for catharsis\
  \ in \u201Cthis fucking city sucks\u201D, the pieces have such authenticity and\
  \ timelessness that began to  incorporate this essence into my own work.\n\nBefore\
  \ I left for Rome, a group of my friends hosted a send off for me. My friend\u2019\
  s\nmentor called me a cognoscenti, a person who knows. I looked up the root word\
  \ in Latin: cognoscente, getting to know. At the time, I didn\u2019t understand\
  \ how that applied to my life. I was born and raised in the Pacific Northwest. I\
  \ barely had lived anywhere outside of Seattle. Yet after the trip, I transformed\
  \ into a cognoscenti. After living independently in a city where I don\u2019t speak\
  \ the language or know the culture, I have reclaimed the agency of my life."
