Text: "Europe. The land of history, pastries, museums, wild contrast from one country\
  \ to the next. I was finally going back to Europe. This time to spend a whirlwind\
  \ three weeks catching up with friends and exploring new places. I couldn't wait.\
  \ Europe and it's ancient buildings, cobblestone streets and winding alleys is the\
  \ stuff of dreams for many recent university graduates just like me. I had scrimped\
  \ and saved and I was finally on the plane to Ireland to start my journey. All I\
  \ had to get through was a ten hour layover in St. John's, Newfoundland. I was prepared\
  \ for several hours of bad airport food, cramped seating and fighting for an outlet\
  \ to charge my phone. How was I to know that I would to come to find that my favourite\
  \ place on my Europe trip was in my home country of Canada?\n\nTaxiing down the\
  \ runway on arrival in St. Johns, I spotted a fellow traveler. His overloaded, yet\
  \ perfectly sized to be considered a carry-on backpack is what caught my eye. I\
  \ guessed, correctly, that he was headed to Europe and was in for the same ten-hour\
  \ wait that I was. In an uncharacteristic moment of brashness, I asked if he would\
  \ like to share a taxi to somewhere touristy to bide the time while we waited for\
  \ our plane to somewhere fascinating and new. He said he had plans for this layover\
  \ and I was welcome to tag along. We exited the terminal, marvelling in the July\
  \ sunshine and piled into a taxi with a couple from the plane. Hilarity ensued as\
  \ we tried to communicate with the taxi driver. We hadn't even left our home country\
  \ and here we were, laughing along with someone speaking perfect English, with the\
  \ strongest Newfie accent I have ever heard. We eventually figured out where we\
  \ were going and after fifteen minutes of swerving through serpentine streets lined\
  \ with strikingly gorgeous coloured houses, we pulled into a gravel drive. An unbelievable\
  \ amount of blue stretched in front of us; the sapphire of the Atlantic ocean blended\
  \ with the cotton candy sky. \n\nBlue was the colour of the day. There was blue\
  \ in the bruises I got after clumsily tripping down the steep stairs on the hike.\
  \  We rewarded ourselves after a three-hour hike along the coast with blue glass\
  \ bottles of beer made from the water of ancient icebergs that glittered in the\
  \ incessant sun. The water of the stream that we scrambled down to with a spontaneous\
  \ Irish girl we met while drinking beer was a cool, silent blue as we soaked our\
  \ hot and dusty feet. A friendly stranger let us photograph her jellybean blue house\
  \ complete matching blue VW van and blue bicycle. The sky darkened to a hazy, navy\
  \ colour as myself and my new companions, the man from the plane and the spontaneous\
  \ Irish girl, devoured fish and chips in the spot recommended to us by locals. \n\
  \nOver more beer, we came to discover that not only was the companion from the plane\
  \ from my hometown, he was in fact the brother of my sister's close friend. I had\
  \ planned this trip to Europe to escape my home town and even my country for a while.\
  \ And here I was, making a new friend who represented the town I wanted so much\
  \ to leave behind for a spell. \n\nSitting in the airport, moments before my departure\
  \ for another continent, I couldn't help but smile over the memories and friends\
  \ I had made on that surreal, blue-tinted ten hours in St. Johns. I knew already\
  \ that I would count these moments among my favourites of this current adventure.\
  \ When I left for Europe, I didn't expect to find wonder and amazement in my home\
  \ country of Canada. But oh, did I ever."
