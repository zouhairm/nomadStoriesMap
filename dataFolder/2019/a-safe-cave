Text: "A SAFE CAVE \nBy Ms Marian Kutsoati\n\nPlans had been underway to move from\
  \ my land of birth the coast of Ghana-West Africa, to an unknown region to pursue\
  \ a fulfilling career. What defines a fulfilling career? Having material possessions\
  \ or being successful at what you do?Upon arrival at what is known to be the financial\
  \ district of the world-London, I was simply stunned with very little knowledge\
  \ about the systems at work, the culture of the British as well as the diversity\
  \ that I experienced in the wake of getting myself acquainted with an unknown land.\
  \ With various cultures in display, one could not firmly link a groups language\
  \ or dish with a particular nationality. Through careful association with friends\
  \ of diverse European background I realised one common trait about them- friendliness.\
  \ I always maintained an open-spirit, improved my connections and established life-long\
  \ ties that have been useful to my stay in London. From one location to the other\
  \ as a roller-coaster, sometimes going back and forth, I struggled to find my bearing.\
  \ It is a large metropolis that involves the careful study of maps to create meaningful\
  \ links to other townships. The initial experience was frightening as I missed my\
  \ planned destinations from time to time but still managed to stay abreast with\
  \ the transport system. I was down in the dumps thinking I would never come to terms\
  \ with my new abode.It was not until a couple of days that I began giving directions\
  \ to tourists which made me feel so accomplished. I had now graduated from the feeling\
  \ of an outcast to a fully-fledged citizen of the United Kingdom and no longer bit\
  \ anyone\u2019s head off. In an English town known as Cutty Sark, there is a rich\
  \ culture of the appreciation of art. Surrounded by River Thames, the chirping and\
  \ flying birds, the breeze produced by the river gives the town its ambience and\
  \ attraction. As a home to several architectural masterpieces from the classical\
  \ Queens home to the contemporary Laban building and other works of art. It is the\
  \ historical monument of classical art and contemporary art. With so much life in\
  \ London somewhat indifferent from the Ghanaian land, one could barely have lone\
  \ time. A launch into student union activities flew me high after a successful election\
  \ to represent the University. I was puzzled however drew my inspiration from the\
  \ standpoint that \u201Cimpossible\u201D is a word that does not exist. The journey\
  \ continued with a new status as a Union Leader coupled with high expectations from\
  \ my new subjects. A train of thoughts flooded my mind as I undertook my new role.\
  \ Was I prepared to undertake all the responsibilities associated with the leadership\
  \ role? Was I prepared to make sacrifices and serve as a medium that makes the University\
  \ a better place of study. With my chest out, I boldly responded yes! Where there\u2019\
  s a will, there\u2019s always a way! Looking forward to a University representation\
  \ trip of a lifetime in Glasgow, I anticipate banking on as many opportunities I\
  \ can. This is the story of my life."
