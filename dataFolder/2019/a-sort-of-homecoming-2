Text: "Our plane touched down at Cork Airport just after 7am, and we made our way\
  \ through the usual international traveler checkpoints to the Arrivals Hall.  Despite\
  \ the tall windows showcasing the ever-struggling Irish sun, and the resulting glare\
  \ doing our bleary eyes no favors, we managed to locate my friend Trevor, who had\
  \ graciously offered to pick us up at the airport.  Exchanging pleasantries and\
  \ gratitude, my husband, stepdaughter, and I wheeled our luggage out into the misty\
  \ morning fog toward Trevor\u2019s car.\n\n\u201CSo - how\u2019s everything, how\
  \ have you been?\u201D I asked, somewhat anticipating the response.\n\nIn true Cork\
  \ phrasing, and with a wry smile, Trevor answered, \u201CWhat - in 14 years, like?\u201D\
  \n\nIt was spot-on; I hadn\u2019t set foot in Ireland in 14 years.\n\nFurthermore,\
  \ apart from a few recent communications, I also hadn\u2019t been in touch with\
  \ Trevor in 14 years.\n\nI had made my first journey to Ireland nearly two decades\
  \ earlier, for a year of undergraduate study at University College Cork.  Unfortunately,\
  \ even with my general zeal for all things Irish, acclimation proved difficult.\
  \  To better adjust, I joined several university clubs and societies, which is how\
  \ I initially met Trevor.  By the end of the year, Trevor had become an integral\
  \ part of my Cork community.  Even as my subsequent travels to Cork grew further\
  \ and further apart, we managed to keep in touch.\n\nThen, somehow, we didn\u2019\
  t.\n\nLess than a month before this trip, Trevor and I reconnected via social media,\
  \ a set of tools barely in its infancy the last time I visited Cork.  My hope was\
  \ to simply meet up, introduce Trevor to my family, and revive our long-lost friendship.\n\
  \nInstead, as Irish hospitality and Cork pride would have it, we were in for more\
  \ than a bit of nostalgia and a quick pint at the pub.\n\nWe shoved our suitcases\
  \ into the trunk of the sedan, took our seats, and departed the airport, beginning\
  \ a circuitous but scenic route toward Cork City.  An odd mixture of familiarity\
  \ and disconnection washed over me as Trevor deftly navigated the narrow suburban\
  \ Irish roads.  Since my husband and stepdaughter had never been to Ireland, a stream\
  \ of observations and questions flowed inside the car.  A native Corkonian, Trevor\
  \ enthusiastically provided answers on all things related to Ireland\u2019s \u201C\
  Rebel County.\u201D\n\nOnce in the city, Trevor clarified the morning plans.  We\
  \ would park at the hilltop school where he now taught, taking in panoramic views\
  \ of the city and countryside, before walking downtown to have breakfast at the\
  \ Farmgate Caf\xE9 overlooking Cork\u2019s famed English Market.\n\nWhile Trevor\
  \ explained the English Market and its storied, quintessentially Cork history to\
  \ my family, I found myself incredulous at the cliched dynamic of past and present\
  \ colliding before my eyes.  I was pleased to see so many older buildings that I\
  \ warmly recalled stubbornly persisting on the city streets.  Yet it was abundantly\
  \ clear that more modern architectural endeavors had made their mark in recent years,\
  \ causing the city to feel colder.  I was settled in the familiar passenger seat\
  \ of Trevor\u2019s car, listening as he excitedly educated my family, whom he had\
  \ known less than an hour.  I was back in the place I still considered my second\
  \ home, realizing just how long I had been away.\n\nAs our umbrella-free quartet\
  \ trekked through the city, the Irish skies unsurprisingly began to drizzle on us.\
  \  I was extremely concerned that the inclement weather would negatively impact\
  \ my family\u2019s first impressions of a place I desperately wanted them to love\
  \ as much as I did.  However, the light rain neither slowed our pace, nor altered\
  \ Trevor\u2019s commitment to giving us an outstanding vacation.\n\nIn the few days\
  \ that followed, Trevor advised us on where to go in Cork, took us to historic Kinsale,\
  \ and climbed the cliffs with us at the Old Head.  He walked with us through Charles\
  \ Fort, drove us down the Wild Atlantic Way, and brought us to charming Clonakilty.\
  \  Finally, on our last day in Ireland, Trevor returned us to Cork Airport.\n\n\u201C\
  Let\u2019s not make it another 14 years,\u201D we both expressed optimistically,\
  \ knowing we quite possibly would, and appreciating that it wouldn\u2019t matter\
  \ in the slightest."
