Text: "The north-east has always been one of the lesser-accessible regions of India.\
  \ This is in part due to the geographical barriers that have not completely succumbed\
  \ to infrastructural development. The bright side to this is that the region is\
  \ lesser explored (and exploited) by tourists.\n\nWe visited Sikkim during the last\
  \ week of January, when many warned us that \u201Cit will be too cold\u201D. However,\
  \ we wanted to see snow, and we weren\u2019t compromising on that. \n\nOur journey\
  \ started in Mumbai, Maharashtra, from where we flew to Bagdogra, West Bengal. An\
  \ SUV was to take us to our hotel in Gangtok, Sikkim. To say that this four-hour\
  \ drive over the mountains is an uneasy one would be putting it lightly. However,\
  \ the breath-taking natural beauty that we got to witness totally made us forget\
  \ any discomfort. On our way, just as we crossed the Teesta IV hydro-project dam\
  \ site, we could see the Teesta river in all its glory. We also spotted the Coronation\
  \ Bridge, which is apparently one of the few remaining open-spandrel-arch bridges\
  \ in India.\n\nTsomgo Lake\nThe itinerary for our first day just had one item \u2014\
  \ visiting the Tsomgo or as the locals call it, the Changu Lake. At the lake site,\
  \ it\u2019s magical to witness the clear blue skies against the backdrop of snow-clad\
  \ mountains. \nHere, one won\u2019t find any restaurants but shacks that serve piping\
  \ hot noodles and momos. In the freezing temperatures, these local delicacies taste\
  \ heavenly. We suggest complementing them with black tea, which helps beat high-altitude\
  \ and travel sickness.\nOne can also opt for yak rides near the Tsomgo. While we\
  \ were concerned about torturing our animal friends, the tribal guides assured us\
  \ that they had only male yaks here. \u201CWe leave mums and babies at home,\u201D\
  \ a yak rider patiently explained, adding that yaks have a capacity of carrying\
  \ 300 kilos and that we all would be like \u201Ca bird on its back\u201D. Despite\
  \ making jokes at our expense, they eventually convinced us for a short ride. The\
  \ yaks, we discovered, are the cleanest animals; it is nature\u2019s benevolence\
  \ to them. These four-legged furry inhabitants of India\u2019s cleanest state \u2014\
  \ Sikkim topped a survey by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) \u2014 have\
  \ naturally odourless everything, from fur to poop.\n\nSpirituality and ecologism\n\
  Day two was reserved for visiting some of the famous monasteries. Buddhist culture\
  \ thrives in Sikkim and it\u2019s evident among the peace-loving locals. It was\
  \ a pleasant surprise to see no one losing their cool in traffic jams. In fact,\
  \ it was all about, \u2018Who\u2019s stuck? Let me help the poor soul out\u2019\
  . Most of the drivers call each other \u201Cbhau\u201D (brother). We even spotted\
  \ someone clear a boulder off the road so that those after him don\u2019t face trouble.\n\
  The calmness of Buddhism, however, hasn\u2019t come in the way of the architectural\
  \ splendour of their temples. All the monasteries are colourful and vibrant with\
  \ intricate detailing adorning statues and pillars. At some monasteries, one can\
  \ shop for souvenirs, too.\nSikkim thrives in natural beauty and the government\
  \ has taken several measures to conserve nature. One such place is the Plant Conservatory.\
  \ It was established in 2015, under Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)\
  \ assisted Sikkim Biodiversity Conservation & Forest Management project, to create\
  \ a recreational-cum-conversational area. It is a must-see for those with a penchant\
  \ for ecological conservation.\n\nKanchenjunga and ropeways\nFurther on in our itinerary\
  \ was the Tashi View Point, from where you apparently get \u201Cthe best view\u201D\
  \ of the Kanchenjunga. Even from afar, a glimpse of the third-highest mountain that\
  \ stands at an elevation of 28,169ft is spellbinding.\nWe concluded our sightseeing\
  \ with a 1km-long ropeway ride during sunset. The cable car did not have any seats,\
  \ and about 15 other tourists crammed into the \u201Cthe last ride of the day\u201D\
  \ giving us a d\xE9j\xE0 vu of travelling in Mumbai\u2019s local trains. Nonetheless,\
  \ we managed a spot near the windows to get an aerial view of the city. The buildings\
  \ stacked precariously on the edges gave it a fairytale-like appearance. Despite\
  \ the crowded cable car, that vision was a pleasant culmination to our stay."
