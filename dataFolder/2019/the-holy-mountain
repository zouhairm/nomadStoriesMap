Text: "I am seated outside my apartment watching the elephants grazing along the fence\
  \ of my camp suddenly I hear something buzzing...that must be my phone, I stood\
  \ and run to my apartment am anxiously waiting for a call from sam,its him calling,there's\
  \ a grin on my face and my heart is beating fast ,I pick up the phone\"clearing\
  \ my throat\"hello sam,how are you?his voice echo in my head as he responds,I am\
  \ well just checking if you are down for tomorrow,I cant help the excitement..\n\
  \   I had met sam a coupleof months ago,the tall handsome warrior had swept me off\
  \ my feet,we had gone on a few dates and planned for the samburu trip on our last\
  \ date.\nMe:Yes sam,am soo ready I was waiting for your call to confirm the set\
  \ trip,\n Sam :okay hun its all set,get you bags ready and everything you need I.will\
  \ pick you up at 10 am.\nMe:okay sam,i can't wait,see you tomorrow and don't be\
  \ late please,\nSam:okay dear have a good evening.\nMe:have a lovely evening too\n\
  (He hangs up.the.phone.\nThroughout the night I couldn't stop thinking about how\
  \ the experience will be,and as am lying on my bed with a millions questions crisscrossing\
  \ on my mind I fell asleep eventually I assume cause that was the last thing I remember.\n\
  The yellow rays peep through my window and the birds chirping,its yet another sunny\
  \ day.I get in to the showers cause I need to get ready before sam shows up,he hates\
  \ waiting .in an hrs time am all set and ready.I get  my suitcaseto the packing\
  \ lot, I got my thermos with coffee already and of course I had an extra one for\
  \ sam,in a few.mins sam suddenly shows up,he steps out of the car,he is not smiling\
  \ sam...is everything okay,why is your face soo gloomy this morning,he gets closer\
  \ gives me a peck on my right cheek,and he says\"goodmorning, he exhales deeply\
  \ but this time am soo tensed am almost loosing my mind ,sam what happend...change\
  \ of plans are the words he uttered to me,...mmmmh...just like that i said,and you\
  \ have the audacity to tell me now when  am all set to go...I begun to get more\
  \ furious and I start pulling back my suitcase but before I could get to my apartment\
  \ ,sam runs after me and gets my bag  and he says come on I was just pulling your\
  \ leg,the trip its still on,my heart leaps with joy as we rush towards the car ,its\
  \ an hour to the camp close to the mountain,sam drives as he continue to laugh at\
  \ me for pranking me..I feel soo stupid ...how could I believe that,\nThe weather\
  \ is hot but there's a  cool breeze from the opened window,sam has been there before\
  \ because its close to his home but he didn't want to spoil my moment to dicover\
  \ the northern part and what it feels like,its been like fourty five mins and suddenly\
  \ sam shouts,viola...there goes themountain ,the holy mountain,mt ololokwe..the\
  \ view from the  Well tamarcked road is epic,sam sudenly stops and asks me we need\
  \ to take pictures of the view its exciting,we get down take a few and finish and\
  \ again we get back to the car and now almost to the camp,we get there and in a\
  \ few minutes we are checked in,we keep our bags and freshen up and sam says are\
  \ we ready...I have my shoes on I have been so ready.the afternoon is cool so we\
  \ decide to  go in the afternoon,as we start.the hike I feel excited that am finally\
  \ doing this the steep rock and the sharp twists around the meandering path towards\
  \ the top gets me more anticipated about the view from the aerial,I can't help to\
  \ imagine,on our way we joined by two british couples on their way and I must say\
  \ the team just  got stronger and we say hello as we continue...I was getting ahead\
  \ but then after an hour I realised I was soo much ahead that I lost sam and  the\
  \ two couples,I.lost my way\"am sweating profusely ,torn between two,should I get\
  \ back or just continue and assume they.mightcatch up\nDashing sound behind me,gets\
  \ me frightened.."
