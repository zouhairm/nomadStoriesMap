Text: "So off I go, first solo trip. To find myself doing something so scary yet invigorating\
  \ was a boost of self confidence that I didn\u2019t think I had. I started off taking\
  \ notes of each adventure and how I felt so I could review at the end of the day,\
  \ honestly first day was a nightmare of heartache/anxiety/stress and the unbearable\
  \ feeling of I CAN\u2019T DO THIS...\nI walk around Rome finding myself in jaw dropping\
  \ situations, the beauty, the architecture, people hand holding and in love, and\
  \ then me, alone and scared.. but I build myself up and find myself carrying on,\
  \ roaming around amazed by everything.. I saw roman ruins, Trevi fountain, coliseum,\
  \ and the Jewish quarter.. amazing memories. I bought a tram ticket but used it\
  \ once. I walked everywhere in sweltering heat, I ate with the locals and drank\
  \ local wine, I found myself gaining more confidence and also having mini break\
  \ downs along the way. It\u2019s an experience everyone should do, to feel themselves\
  \ build themselves up when they got knocked down.\nTo travel and roam in a foreign\
  \ country, to see and embark on the beauty and local activities, to see the amazing\
  \ work throughout the areas, side streets that have no one walking down them but\
  \ the beauty that lay within these small streets. I would walk all day.m returning\
  \ to the hotel union sunset, sitting on the rooftop terrace reading my adventures\
  \ throughout the day, looking at the pictures of what I\u2019d seen.. amazing myself\
  \ at what I had overcome, writing my feelings down and seen how brave I was to embark\
  \ on a journey of unknown, alone in a foreign country, unknown what was on the way,\
  \ what this trip would bring me, how it could change me, how it\u2019s making me\
  \ feel, I feel lonely now, how can I survive the next 4 days.. we\u2019ll i suprised\
  \ myself I took those next four days and found myself happier and more at peace\
  \ than any other time in the last 32 years of my life.. people saying \u201Cyou\u2019\
  re on your own\u201D - \u201Chad you no one to bring with you\u201D - \u201C I could\
  \ never be so brave\u201D mixed comments left me with mixed emotions.. till the\
  \ final day and I met this amazing couple in my hotel.. they told me, they\u2019\
  d been watching me, they\u2019d never seen me with anyone at dinner or breakfast\
  \ and was so interested in hearing my story, so I told them, all my life I had people\
  \ telling me \u201CI can\u2019t do this\u201D - \u201CI\u2019ll amount to nothing\u201D\
  \ - \u201CI\u2019ll be alone for all my life\u201D - \u201Csomeone like you is scared\
  \ to achieve or amount to anything\u201D so I done all I could and took that leap\
  \ into the unknown, no I\u2019ve my stories of how I done this and how amazing it\
  \ was, the confidence it gave me.. now instead of people telling me \u201Cyou can\u2019\
  t\u201D they say \u201C wow, your really brave\u201D.. how attitudes change when\
  \ you tell them it\u2019s the most memorable experience in your life. Something\
  \ everyone should do.m, and because of this, I write my travel blog, anxiousglobbter86\
  \ on blog it and I\u2019ve had many come to me and say thank you for helping them,\
  \ so that that unknown leap, if I can do it, you can.. the words I can\u2019t. Simply\
  \ say I can.."
