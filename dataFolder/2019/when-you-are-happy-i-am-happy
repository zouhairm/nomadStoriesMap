Text: "It\u2019s not quite lunch time but I'm hungry. I stroll around the cobblestoned\
  \ city, and find myself in front of a white door. That leads me to a mysterious\
  \ eatery, hours before my return flight. People are in; I'm looking to get a sandwich\
  \ for lunch. The vendor greets me with \"Bonjour\" and a smile. He proceeds to give\
  \ me the  menu, then encourages me to have a seat, as I wait for my turn, and  decide\
  \ on what I'd like to have.\n\nIt was my first time there. It's tiny, but seemed\
  \ to gather a lot of interest and appreciation from people. The ambient atmosphere\
  \ is calming. \n\nIn front of his workstation, through the display window, you can\
  \ see tens of different cheeses. On top of his work station, condiments and fruits.\
  \ On the wall, there are handwritten banners saying you can order milkshakes for\
  \ 3 euros. I also see a banner urging us to not leave without cheese,  because \"\
  The cheese is the gift\", it notes.\n\nAt a table in front of me is a group of young\
  \ Americans. They've had a great time it seems. Raving about the sandwiches they\
  \ just had and thanking their host for bringing them here. They decide to make a\
  \ final takeaway order, before leaving.\n\nAs I wait to give my order, I notice\
  \ the bells hanging through the ceiling and resting in front of the entrance. Every\
  \ few minutes, a new customer will emerge. The bells jingled as the door opened\
  \ and slammed over them.\n\nMy turn has finally arrived! I ask the seller to recommend\
  \ his top picks.  He gives me two suggestions, one with hard and one with soft cheese.\
  \ He points to a beautiful ball of soft cheese decorated with cranberries!\n\n\"\
  It looks amazing\", I thought.\n\nHe then points to a piece of hard cheese. He proceeds\
  \ by offering me a thin slice of it, so I can try. I informed him that I'd take\
  \ his hard cheese suggestion. He then asked, with a strong yet friendly Belgian\
  \ accent:\n\n\"Are you sure? When you're happy, I'm happy.\"\n\nAt the sound of\
  \ that, my eyes lit up. A stranger cares about my happiness?\n\n\"I don't know if\
  \ it will make me happy. It's my first time here. I'd know when I try it.\", I replied.\n\
  \n\"This is just my suggestion, but please choose whatever you want. I want you\
  \ to be happy. I want you to smile.\", he noted.\n\nThat prompted me to go for something\
  \ else, a combination I saw in the menu. A mix of spicy hard cheese, soft cheese,\
  \ chorizo, apple slices, and honey! \"This combination seems so weird. I am not\
  \ sure  if I'd like this, nor if it will make me as happy, but I want to try something\
  \ new.\", I thought.\n\nHe meticulously crafts the sandwich. Everyone attentively\
  \ stares at the process, through the display vitrine. I decided to have a seat.\n\
  \n\n\"It's ready!\", he says, and I stand.\n\nIt is a take away, I need to catch\
  \ my flight soon.\n\nHe hands my order and states, \"If you are not happy, come\
  \ again!\"\n\n\"Today I'm traveling far away, so I won't be able to do that.\",\
  \ I replied.\n\n\"I'm here everyday. Come again another time.\"\n\n\"Alright, I'll\
  \ keep it in mind.\", I said.\n\nAs this conversation unfolds people are queuing,\
  \ waiting to place their order.\n\nThe seller restates, \"Please smile! When you\
  \ are happy, I'm happy.\"\n\nThe kindness in his soul is contagious. I couldn't\
  \ help but smile.\n\nWhile I was leaving, he said, \"Thank you for smiling\", mirroring\
  \ my smile.\n\nAs I walked away with a lingering grin, I noticed other customers\
  \ smiling right back at me. It was a beautiful scene of pure bliss and happiness.\
  \ I didn't expect to find my smile becoming contagious. \n\nOutside, I stand on\
  \ the cobblestoned pavement, unwrapping the paper towel covered sandwich. I have\
  \ a first bite. The richness of flavors, in this unique combination of ingredients,\
  \ hits my palate. I want more, but can't afford to wait in the queue again.\n\n\
  It was delicious, and oh so good that I smiled!"
