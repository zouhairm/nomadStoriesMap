Text: "When I decided to travel to Kenya against my mother's most horrific predictions,\
  \ including being run over by a pack of Zebras (Zebras don't move in packs, duh!),\
  \ I was looking for a wild adventure: red soil on my feet, burning sun on my skin,\
  \ pungent smells and transparent eyes. I found all that and more by immersing myself\
  \ in a complete different lifestyle and culture for two months, an experience that\
  \ changed my life completely. But the local connection that most impacted me and\
  \ really changed my perspective on the world was a very unexpected one. \nIt was\
  \ a slow early afternoon (like most of the afternoons in such hot and humid country),\
  \ and I was reading on a mattress on the ground of my huge tent; I was on a safari\
  \ on my way to climb the Kilimanjaro, and rest breaks were key to be able to complete\
  \ the whole hike. Crickets filled the surreal quiet of nature with their monotoned\
  \ chant providing the most pleasant lullaby until, they suddenly stopped. Weird.\
  \ I watched way too many horror films to know that this can't be sign of anything\
  \ good. A loud stomp. Then another. And just like that, I turn to the other side\
  \ of my tent to see a massive elephant that literally just SNUCK behind me. I always\
  \ thought that, faced with such gigantic wild animal, my first reaction would have\
  \ been: RUN! Instead, I found myself completely frozen by... serendipity? I was\
  \ witnessing the miracle of nature in its most simple and natural way. I was looking\
  \ at the biggest creature I've ever seen feeding itself, and it was magical. I have\
  \ never been a religious person, but in that exact moment I saw so clearly in front\
  \ of me the overpowering perfection of nature, I felt the energy of a Universal\
  \ balance that's way too complex for the unworthy human mind to understand. That\
  \ encounter gave a silent shock to my soul and connected my spirit to the real Africa.\
  \ I realised how small and insignificant I am, and yet how important is to fulfil\
  \ my destiny as a microscopical link keeping together the chain of life. The animal\
  \ kept on eating for a couple of minutes, and then left without even glancing at\
  \ me. Since being back to reality, the stress and frustration of life in a big city\
  \ inevitably took over the peace of mind acquired during my African experience.\
  \ But I always carry with me this universal secret, an instinctive awareness of\
  \ nature and a blind faith in a natural balance, thanks to my biggest friend and\
  \ new tattoo: the Sneaky Elephant."
