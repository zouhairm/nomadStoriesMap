Text: "A little tap on my arm woke me up from dreamland, where I stood upon a bridge\
  \ and marvelled at the magnificence of La Seine, it's grandeur opulence. Oh! How\
  \ I love Paris. That was unfortunately not that case as I was laying on a mat, in\
  \ a bus terminal, in Lagos, Nigeria, soon to journey for hours by land to another\
  \ country. \nPrequel to the trip, the excitement I felt knew no bound as I sat by\
  \ the window to take pictures and soon, we were out of Badagary heading towards\
  \ the Cotonou border. \n\nNigeria share borders with some Francophone countries\
  \ and that helped put my elementary French lessons to use as I tried deciphering\
  \ every billboard I saw. We had stop overs for clearance at the borders where I\
  \ was greeted with lots of \"bonjour belle mademoiselle, Qu'aimerais-tu acheter?\"\
  . Yes, I knew the \"bonjour\" and \"belle mademoiselle\" part but the rest, I was\
  \ helpless and for the first time, language barrier slapped me in the face.\n\n\
  One of the trip's best moment was the attempt to buy groundnuts from an assumed\
  \ French speaker at Aflao, the last boarder into Ghana. Approaching, my partner\
  \ and I began unearthing the French vocabularies we knew to express \"how much is\
  \ it?\". Google translation would have been the knight in shining armor but unfortunately,\
  \ we had no access to Wi-Fi. So, after we've blurted out the last of our knowledge\
  \ while she stared at us as if we were escaped lunatics, she busted out laughing\
  \ and confessed \"I can speak English\". Trust me, it was embarrassing but funny\
  \ though she supplied the correct expression, \"Combien \xE7a co\xFBte?\", which\
  \ according to her would save us from future talks of shame.\n\nIn the little time\
  \ we spent at the French speaking countries, I met a young man, a local who could\
  \ speak few English words. He said, while gesticulating with his hands \"Your country,\
  \ my country, beside each other, you speak English, I speak French and we do not\
  \ understand one another, though we close\" and closing his palms together. It was\
  \ truly a thought provoking statement.\n\nWe arrived at Tema in Ghana around 12:00\
  \ am. Unfortunately, our host, a young man we met through Couchsurfing, an online\
  \ platform where travellers get connected with locals for accommodation, was unavailable.\
  \ Hanson's phone was switched off. Umm, but getting stranded was not how I pictured\
  \ my first experience travelling. \nWith a minimal amount allocated to miscellaneous,\
  \ we approached a motel in the middle of the night. The hotelier was obviously sleepy,\
  \ still, he gave a welcoming smile and with little verbal communication, he took\
  \ us to a neatly arranged room, gave us a key and turned back to sleep. Perplexed,\
  \ we called him back, \"Sir, how much is per night? We need to know if we can afford\
  \ it\" He smiled again and said \"From the way you speak, I figured you're Nigerians\
  \ and that makes us neighbors. Here, we are family. Sleep well and see you in the\
  \ morning\". My partner and I exchanged glances and wondered as the keeper closed\
  \ the door, almost immediately, he opened it again and whispered \"welcome to Ghangeria\"\
  .\n\nIt took me a while to realize it was a combination of the name of our countries,\
  \ Ghana and Nigeria and truly, we might be separated by boarders but at heart, we\
  \ are family. \n\nBefore I slept that morning, I flipped the newly stamped pages\
  \ of my international passport as I recalled the sight of the oceans we crossed,\
  \ the faces, smiles and laughters of strangers I have seen during the trip, the\
  \ languages and understanding we had without words and how a stranger opened his\
  \ door to two strangers in the middle of the night, I closed the passport, kissed\
  \ it as I drifted into another dreamland. This time, it was Valencia, during La\
  \ Tomatina, in Spain.\n\nTruly, the world is out there and it calls out to me."
