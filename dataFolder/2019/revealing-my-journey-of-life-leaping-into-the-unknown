Text: "Deodatta V Shenai- Khatkhate once said \u2018When you take a leap into the\
  \ unknown, only two things can happen. Either you fall freely, all the way to the\
  \ ground, or you develop your wings and begin to fly. The result is unknown until\
  \ you try.\u2019 This story reveals about my journey of life as I travelled from\
  \ different homes, locations when everything took a twist of turn. Been living in\
  \ a platonic cave, lacking nothing and never felt the pain of losing a mother when\
  \ she passed on when I was just a toddler as i had the best attention, love and\
  \ support in short I was spoiled. We had an exultant quite life with my father but\
  \ all that changed when a new woman came into our lives. Suddenly there was a twirl\
  \ as my new second mother felt she was in competition for love with my father and\
  \ felt much attention was drawn more to me than her children. She began to despise,\
  \ curse allowing her words to control me and being sentimental, she used that at\
  \ her advantage. At the age of twenty I was bitten severely each time I missed what\
  \ she instructed hence fear and bitterness sank in. Mentally I was deranged. Professionally\
  \ both my parents served in the military force, she owned a higher rank than my\
  \ father\u2019s and that gave her more power to control everything despite a man\
  \ being the head of the family. I became recluse and avoided the company of others,\
  \ it was no longer a home. My performance in college dropped and I for slowed going\
  \ for holiday vacations after school and visited at relative\u2019s place even it\
  \ means they had nothing. It was better to eat a dry crust of bread than to have\
  \ a feast in the house full of trouble. By the time I graduated I was chased out\
  \ of the house, and my father saw it better deserving to depart though I could tell\
  \ he was wounded. I began travelling in different locations, cities even outside\
  \ the country beyond the border moving from one household to another experiencing\
  \ different lifestyles and had to exert myself to modify in line of what each family\
  \ expected. With the economic crises in my country, I burdened other families more\
  \ hence could not permit myself to stay not more than three months. I became like\
  \ a nomad, a wonderer with no sense of belonging. The feeling of knowing that you\
  \ a graduate, unemployed and feeding from one household to the other was unbearable.\
  \ I fed from hand to mouth and some of those families would use my presence at their\
  \ own advantage. My life was doleful, I was trapped. As they say when you reached\
  \ the rock bottom, the only way is up. I had to train my mindset in a positive way\
  \ to experience the beauty side of life. Living a life of constant fear and rejection\
  \ made me realize battle was never with people but the mindset. I became like a\
  \ palm of Lebanon, and did not concede words to annihilate my inner peace. When\
  \ one is in contentment you tend to overlook what are others are facing in their\
  \ day to day lives, their struggles and become judgmental towards them. My struggles\
  \ were an eye opener as they made me become more affectionate to the needy and understood\
  \ how it feels not to have food on the table, a roof over your head. It taught me\
  \ to practice humanity towards the less privileged. Along the way, I found a family\
  \ which volunteered to take care of me and made their place to be my permanent home.\
  \ I was no different with their children and everything in that home was done with\
  \ love. I had inner peace from a stranger\u2019s house which I lacked when I was\
  \ under my own parent\u2019s home. They never took slight issues into heart and\
  \ every problem was solved amicably. Conclusively this journey of leaping into the\
  \ unknown helped me to grow and modified myself physically ,spiritually and mentally\
  \ in a way that any circumstance be it good or vicious, made me become sturdy and\
  \ embraced the little things which I overlooked."
