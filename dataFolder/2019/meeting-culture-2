Text: "Culture is so beautiful in its own way. Different human race blend into one\
  \ culture and new culture is formed. Culture gives birth to our values, our food,\
  \ our festival, our family and list goes on. Traveling makes us understand how one\
  \ culture has given birth to other culture and food. It helps us to understand all\
  \ culture have same values & same thought process. \n\nTraveling in itself is a\
  \ meditation to me. I want to share my travel story to one of the most beautiful\
  \ place on this earth Leh Ladakh. Leh Ladakh is in India, in the state Jammu & Kashmir.\
  \ Listening the name of Kashmir, we get  a picture in our mind of beautiful pine\
  \ trees mountain and shikarad in Dal Lake. My journey started from Kashmir. I enjoyed\
  \ my evening in Kashmir before my road trip started to Leh Ladakh.\n\nThe journey\
  \ started in the early morning from Kashmir. It is said, that starts well that ends\
  \ well. The journey started with the authentic tea of the region, 'Kava' and the\
  \ authentic bread made in chulla. On our way to Leh Ladakh from Kashmir we did white\
  \ water rafting. The water was so cold, that in every splash of water, we were getting\
  \ goosebumps. After white water rafting, we had authentic Kashmir food in small\
  \ road side restaurant made by local kashmiri. \n\nIn few hours, we reached Kargil,where\
  \ we had a night stay. In night, the beauty of Kargil was not visible, but in early\
  \ morning as the sun rays touched Himalayan mountains, the beauty of Kargil was\
  \ mind blowing. The river flowing beside our hotel and the cold breeze made a beautiful\
  \ combination. \n\nFrom Kargil our journey started again to a village, just before\
  \ Ladakh. The village had a beautiful resort. They welcomed us with peach shake.\
  \ They had organic farm with exotic vegetables. At night, from telescope we can\
  \ see planets Mars and Venus. The village had few thousand population with Buddhist\
  \ culture.  The village in itself had a beautiful feeling.\n\nWe started our journey\
  \ to our final destination, Ladakh. Our our way, we clicked famous  Leh Ladakh photograph,\
  \ sitting on road in Magnetic Mountain. We reached, Ladakh in the afternoon, where\
  \ our hotel was in middle of the market. The hotel was surrounded by small shops,\
  \ where we get Ladakh sovereign and Ladakh food. People in Ladakh speak slow and\
  \ walk slow. The reason if we discover is less oxygen in area. Ladakh is only cold\
  \ dessert in the world with various habitat surviving. We visited various Buddhist\
  \ Stupa, desert and lake. The journey and food in itself is unique. The salt tea,\
  \ the dark cheese, the Ladhakhi food is unique and shows its culture.\n\nJourney\
  \ is meeting different culture. Leh Ladakh trip has given taste of their beautiful\
  \ culture, food, people and religion."
