Text: "I expected to find many things when I went to Paris: arts, good food, music,\
  \ inspiration. I was alone for the fist time in my life, away from my family and\
  \ friends, and knowing only one or two phrases in French to survive the next five\
  \ months. I was hoping to find myself, not someone else, but ended up getting both,\
  \ and that has forever changed me. \nWe were probably the two most different people\
  \ in the world: I\u2019m a Christian, he is a Muslim, I grew up involved in Western\
  \ culture, he knew nothing about it but taught me a lot about Eastern costumes and\
  \ traditions. Maybe the worst of all: he is a dog person, while I\u2019m the embodiment\
  \ of the cat lady concept! Still, we roamed around the city exchanging our unique\
  \ worldviews and maybe were the lights that would illuminate everything after sunset\
  \ or the accordion players near the Seine, but each time we met our differences\
  \ seemed less and less important as we grew fond of each other. \nThat is the kind\
  \ of romance that could only grow in a place like Paris with its vibrant mix of\
  \ cultures. We would sit in tables alongside our friends from all over the world,\
  \ listening to their fascinating tales of daily-life and little by little discovering\
  \ that not just us, but everyone who lives is, in the end, nothing more or less\
  \ than human, and all the things that keeps us apart are frivolous. \nIt was very\
  \ movie-like: a picknick under the Eiffel Tower, a late date near the river, exploring\
  \ the infinite restaurants to try dishes from all over the world, going out in the\
  \ middle of the night just to see the Opera illuminated.\nBut our happy ending didn\u2019\
  t come. I had to go back to my country, and he stayed in France.  And even if the\
  \ stars aligned, taking all our problems away, we still had to deal with the non-acceptance\
  \ of our families. Since the beginning, we decided that this would be a short-termed\
  \ story.\nFor a long time, I thought that Paris would be cursed for me: the place\
  \ where I found love and lost it. That would be the lesson I got from the capital\
  \ of romance and, oh, what a fool, I should have seen this coming. \nBoth of us\
  \ had never experienced that before and knowing that it had to end broke our hearts.\
  \ We were innocent, breathing the romantic atmosphere that surrounded us, pretending\
  \ that wishing for something enough was somehow a solution. Heartbreak is always\
  \ a hard lesson and pain is an inevitable teacher, but now I see that we were the\
  \ lucky ones, blessed to see love in its purest form: above all borders."
