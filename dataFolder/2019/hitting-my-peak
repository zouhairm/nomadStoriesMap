Text: "I stop to drink some water and suddenly my whole body feels like it\u2019s\
  \ failing me. I\u2019m sweating despite the fact that I\u2019m fighting the 0\xB0\
  C weather with a paper thin windbreaker, sandals, and three pairs of socks as gloves.\
  \ I need to sit. No, throw up. No. Eat? \n\nIt\u2019s dark. Two in the morning dark.\
  \ And I\u2019m scared.\n\nAn endless sea of headlights is approaching, forcing me\
  \ to decide whether to wade against the tide and head back to my tent or continue\
  \ on into the pitch black abyss ahead of me.\n\nMy partner Ben and I hopped off\
  \ the boat at the Lombok port, just a nauseating 15-minute speed boat ride from\
  \ Gili Trawangan. It\u2019s a small island with little tourist appeal but we were\
  \ there for one purpose: to hike Mount Rinjani.\n\nI was noticeably more anxious\
  \ than Ben, as per usual. It\u2019s not that I thought I couldn\u2019t do it, but\
  \ some of the preliminary questions the company asked via email had me a bit concerned.\
  \ \u201CHave you ever hiked 11 km in a day?\u201D Of course, I had\u2014I had hiked\
  \ much more than that actually\u2014but my comfort zone was the Canadian backcountry,\
  \ and between the language barrier and the unknown terrain, I wasn\u2019t sure how\
  \ I\u2019d hold up on an Indonesian camping trip.\n\nI\u2019d spent to last four\
  \ summers leading canoe and hiking trips through Ontario Provincial Parks, but recently\
  \ I decided to resign. Every year I got physically stronger, but every year my anxiety\
  \ crept up just a little bit. I first started hiking as a way to calm my anxiety,\
  \ but somehow it also became a source of it. Recently, the anxiety-inducing factors\
  \ of hiking had been getting to me more than the healing factors had been helping\
  \ me. I thought I had lost that strength hiking gave me back when I was 16 and just\
  \ discovering how empowering it could be. \n\nNow I\u2019m facing my hardest climb.\
  \ Now I need that strength I lost. Our guide Alim wakes up at 2 a.m. that morning,\
  \ passes us a warm egg and cheese sandwich in our tent and, we embark on our six-hour\
  \ trek to the top of Rinjani. The beginning is easy. Step on that rock. Grab this\
  \ root. Follow the crowd. But around 40 minutes in I feel myself crack. I pulled\
  \ over to the side as hikers pass me, glancing my way first to send their condolences.\
  \ All I want to do is vomit, or turn around, or curl up in a ball and wait until\
  \ sunrise. Alim says if I can make it a little further there\u2019s a spot I could\
  \ watch the sunrise. It\u2019s not as good as the summit but it\u2019s better than\
  \ nothing.  \n\nWhen we reach the plateau I tell Alim I would keep moving, but I\u2019\
  m not going to summit. \n\nHours pass and I\u2019m still climbing. \u201CJust a\
  \ little further,\u201D I tell myself until suddenly we\u2019re at the base of the\
  \ final incline. A one-hour trek up a forty-five-degree angle ledge completely composed\
  \ of volcanic rock. For each step you take, you slide back at least two. Once you\
  \ start up here there\u2019s really no turning back. \n\nBen and Alim look at me\
  \ to hear my decision. I say nothing. I start climbing. \n\nMy brain is screaming\
  \ \u201CI can\u2019t do it,\u201D but my mouth is whispering something else.  \u201C\
  I can do it. I can do it,\u201D I chant on every exhale. I dig my toe into the ground\
  \ and then claw at it with my hands. Hikers are curled up on the sides of the narrow\
  \ path\u2014I remember that feeling. But that\u2019s not where I want to be. The\
  \ sun starts to peak out from behind the mountains and I can see exactly where I\
  \ was going to be.\n\nThe light exposes the path just as we just conquered and I\
  \ can see for the first time what I had just done. \u201CHey, you made it,\u201D\
  \ one of the other hikers says, recognizing me as the girl who was about the bail\
  \ less than an hour into the journey. It\u2019s ok the be that girl, but it\u2019\
  s just not me."
