Text: "It was night and the sky was becoming greenish. Around me was silence and,\
  \ all of of a sudden, I heard a loud bang below my feet. Booooom. Everybody around\
  \ me started running away and I really couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.\n\
  \nStanding in the middle of a frozen lake in Lapland, Finland\u2019s northernmost\
  \ region, I was admiring the incredible natural scenery around me when the ice covering\
  \ the surface began to break. Ten people were standing next to me and, after hearing\
  \ the bang, they run towards the shore of the lake.\n\n\u2018Chiara, come here.\
  \ Run, run!\u2019 my sister shouted. Her voice echoed in the dark but colourful\
  \ night. \u2018The ice is breaking, come here, quickly!\u2019\n\nI was totally lost\
  \ in my own thoughts, thinking how wonderful that solitary angle of the Earth was.\
  \ It took me a while to realise what had happened. Only after everyone started shouting\
  \ my name very loudly, I turned around and run towards the rest of the group trying\
  \ not to slip on the icy surface of the lake.\n\nWhat an adventure.\n\nWhen you\
  \ embark on a journey to a far-away destination, you never know what to expect.\
  \ You draft a plan, you set out a few places to see and some things to do, but there\
  \ is always an element of magical waiting for you.\n\nI am one of those people who\
  \ love to plan trips in advance but I also enjoy spontaneous adventures and that\
  \ is exactly what happened in Lapland. \n\nThe night trip to see the Northern Lights\
  \ was unexpected and not planned.\n\nI got on a bus from Rovaniemi, Santa Claus\u2019\
  \ Village, with a few more thrill-seeking people and, as our driver made her way\
  \ in the middle of the northern Finnish forest, I looked out of the window. I couldn\u2019\
  t help falling in love with the landscape. Snow didn\u2019t seem to end anywhere\
  \ - everything was white, everything was magical. That\u2019s how I had always imagined\
  \ fairy tales to look like and that\u2019s where I found myself all of a sudden.\n\
  \nMaybe it\u2019s because of the time of the year I visited it - between Christmas\
  \ and New Year\u2019s Eve, when temperatures reach their lowest peaks - but Lapland\
  \ really resonates in my mind as the most beautiful place I\u2019ve ever been to.\n\
  \nThe short-but-intense trip made me experience the coldest weather I\u2019ve ever\
  \ been exposed to: -27C. Wearing layers and layers of clothes never seemed enough,\
  \ but something special about Lapland made the cold less cold: maybe the smiles\
  \ on people\u2019s face, the voices of children playing in the snow or the constant\
  \ contact with nature.\n\nOne day my family and I went for an excursion with huskies\
  \ in the middle of the forest. The arctic dogs run fast among the snowy trees and\
  \ the cold wind was impressed on our faces. We wore scarves, hats, gloves, but every\
  \ single second made us feel the -27C fully on our bodies. My mum left a lock of\
  \ hair outside her hat and I was very shocked when I saw it breaking up after freezing.\
  \ Luckily it was just a small lock.\n\nWith only two hours of sunlight, days in\
  \ Lapland seemed very short. We soon understood we couldn\u2019t waste any second\
  \ and we began appreciating time even more: every minute of sunlight was an extra\
  \ opportunity for an adventure.\n\nIf someone asks me why I loved Lapland so much,\
  \ I could try to explain the feeling of cold on my body, the magic I experienced\
  \ when looking at the greenish sky, the beauty of locals who proudly show the richness\
  \ of their land. \n\nI could try to explain the sensations, the excitement and the\
  \ adrenaline I felt when the ice started breaking below my feet in the middle of\
  \ a frozen lake, but it would never represent what I lived fully. \n\nLapland is\
  \ not a simple destination, it is not just one of those places you  tick off your\
  \ bucket list: Lapland is a feeling, it is an emotion, it is something you can understand\
  \ only by living it."
