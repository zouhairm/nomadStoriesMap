Text: "This was a sudden plan to travel to have some adventure.  We planed to travel\
  \ Gangwondo, a province in korea. Whithin a short notice we arranged our 3 day 2\
  \ night journey. Crazy cold at our depurture day was first obstacle but who cares!\
  \ We were determined. Our mini bus started breaking snow covered road and we started\
  \ amazements.\nWe reachd the the destination after 4 hours long drive from Daejeon.\
  \ Having a small refreshment, the team started surfing the area. A lot of amusements\
  \ all over the area, among them the Olympic vanue was the center of attraction.\
  \ Everything that I visited was surprising but the thing I still remember is the\
  \ skywalk experience. \nCan you Imagine that you are walking over the sky, the ground\
  \ is so far that even the gigantic trees were looking like plants in your flower\
  \ tub. Literally, there was nothing under my feet but a layer of transparent glass\
  \ which I couldn't trust on. That was blood curdling experience which made me almost\
  \ crying. I failed to cry infront of other friends and also failed to smile while\
  \ taking pictures.\nThat was an experience that I will ever remember. I have seen\
  \ the ground from higher altitudes many times but that time it was full of adventure."
