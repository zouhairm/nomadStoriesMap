Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find . . . myself\n\nI\u2019ve lived in South Africa\
  \ my whole life, but I never really realized how amazing it was until my boyfriend\
  \ and I decided to quit our jobs and travel for three months around our homeland.\
  \  We called it our \u201Cgatvol\u201D tour (gatvol = fed up/tired of everything).\
  \  In our case, we were just tired of our entire lives and the direction they were\
  \ heading in.\n\nNeither one of us wanted to get married, have children (right then\
  \ anyways) or buy a house like all of our friends were doing.  Instead, we wanted\
  \ to take time off and just travel.  I had traveled through Europe extensively when\
  \ I was 20, but I had never really done that around my own country and feeling lost\
  \ and out of place seemed like the best time to do it.  I saved up for six months,\
  \ worked my bum off and eventually it was time to leave.  Our first day didn\u2019\
  t go exactly to plan with us still waiting on a new video camera we had bought for\
  \ the trip to arrive before leaving.  It was already a week overdue, but I just\
  \ couldn\u2019t wait one more night to leave.  I told my boyfriend that if we didn\u2019\
  t leave right then, we might never leave.  At the time, that just wasn\u2019t an\
  \ option.\n\nI struggle with depression and found that when I worked at a job I\
  \ didn\u2019t enjoy, or fought with my partner more times than I laughed with him,\
  \ my life would just feel like a big black hole that I couldn\u2019t possibly climb\
  \ my way out of.  I had always struggled with finding something to get me out of\
  \ bed in the morning and keep me truly happy all day.  It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019\
  t feel passionately about anything.  In fact, the opposite was true.  I found myself\
  \ passionate about too many things and not sure what to stick with.  I loved writing.\
  \  I loved taking photos and I loved to travel.  All I wanted at the time was to\
  \ find a job that would combine all three of my great loves.  Needless to say, that\
  \ proved impossible.  So, instead of getting a lump sum from a rich aunt somewhere\
  \ (I wish), I worked super hard to make the money to travel.  Spending money on\
  \ traveling never seemed like a waste to me.\n\nThe best part about traveling for\
  \ three months was the unexpected places and sights that we found along the way.\
  \  We had planned most of the journey out, but sometimes nature didn\u2019t exactly\
  \ play along with where we wanted to go.  We had to change directions a couple of\
  \ times without planning, especially when the flowers in Namaqualand decided to\
  \ bloom early because of all the rain. \n \nWe also found ourselves making friends\
  \ with others that were travelling around South Africa the same as us.  We found\
  \ more often than not that most people felt exactly the same as we did.  They were\
  \ tired of their mundane routines and just wanted to get out and enjoy their lives\
  \ again.  Yes, we were young (under 30), but we\u2019d somehow lost our way and\
  \ felt like we were on the verge of an early mid-life crisis.\n\nI\u2019m incredibly\
  \ scared of heights, but found myself walking across a huge suspension bridge at\
  \ Oribi Gorge.  We tasted wine on many, many wine farms in Franschhoek and Stellenbosch.\
  \  We hiked through the mountains of Kaapsehoop and found their wild horses.  I\
  \ sat on an ostrich and held its baby.  We walked with teenage lions.  We lay in\
  \ a field of orange flowers in Namaqualand and watched lightning shoot across the\
  \ sky over the Augrabies waterfall.  My favorite memory however, was getting to\
  \ feed and massage Jessica the Hippo with my feet.\n\nThrough all of the activities,\
  \ all of the traveling and camping along the way, we ended up meeting some amazing\
  \ people.  We also ended up finding ourselves again.  Somewhere along the way we\
  \ ended up finding our happiness again and also finding our way back to each other.\
  \  We were just looking for a break, but ended up finding so much more than that."
