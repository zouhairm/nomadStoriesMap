Text: "When I asked Douglas of what to consider when going to explore the Pantanal\
  \ his simple answer was: \u201CDon\u2019t get too much drunk and sleep on the floor.\
  \ Anacondas might want to eat you.\u201D Also, \u201CYou are wearing motorbike boots,\
  \ you should be ok for snake bites.\u201D LOL! Ok, I suddenly realised to be in\
  \ the middle of no mens land, in the middle of the wilderness\u2026\n\nCaymans,\
  \ snakes, bugs and other poisonous stuff just everywhere. And not to forget\u2026\
  \ the top predator and king of the animal kingdom in the Pantanal: The mighty jaguar.\
  \ Apparently, it is not a good idea to walk alone in the early and late hours of\
  \ the day. The animals got very much used to humans and might possess a serious\
  \ risk. Certainly, I would not be at risk\u2026 I had to recover from my exhausting\
  \ motorcycle ride down the Transpantaneira and fell immediately to sleep. When waking\
  \ up the day, I could feel every single muscle in my body and realised that the\
  \ trip cost much more energy that I initially thought.\n\nI could not believe my\
  \ eyes when leaving my simple accommodation. Two deep blue macaws were just sitting\
  \ in front of the door step and were in search of water like so many other animal\
  \ species during the dry season of this year in the Pantanal.\n\n\u201CThe Pantanal\
  \ is the world\u2019s largest wetland, pooling over 81,000 square miles (210,000\
  \ square kilometres)\u2026in the center of South America, mostly in central-western\
  \ Brazil and straddling the borders of Paraguay and Bolivia. Often overshadowed\
  \ by the Amazon to the north, the Pantanal quietly harbors the highest concentration\
  \ of wildlife in South America. It\u2019s part national park and part UNESCO World\
  \ Heritage site, and it\u2019s considered a critical region of the world by the\
  \ World Wildlife Fund, which estimates that 325 species of fish, 159 species of\
  \ mammals, 656 species of birds, 53 species of amphibians, and 98 species of reptiles\
  \ live in this hotbed of biodiversity.\u201D\n\nAfter breakfast we started our safari\
  \ around 8 o\u2019clock and hopped on our boat. Driving more than 30 minutes upstream\
  \ we saw from the far distance a couple of boats anchored across a sand bank. I\
  \ first did not realise but Doug mentioned that we might be very lucky and indeed,\
  \ there he was. The mighty Jaguar, lying lazily on the sand bank and posing already\
  \ for the cameras of the safari tourists who came like me to spot this beautiful\
  \ animal.\n\nI could not believe my eyes and adrenaline was rushing through my veins\u2026\
  \ an enormous feeling of happiness to encounter the \u201COnza\u201D (Portuguese\
  \ for Jaguar) already on the first meters of our early day. I just could not get\
  \ enough of the beautiful camouflage of the animal! After a couple of minutes of\
  \ laying at the sand bank he moved majestically along the river in search of possible\
  \ prey. Smoothly and very carefully with his head in between his shoulders he made\
  \ one step after the next.\n\nMy favourite moment of the day was to observe the\
  \ jaguar drinking water out of the river. Only by magnifying the pictures and seeing\
  \ the animal more in detail, you could see the \u201Cfrightening\u201D impression\
  \ of the jaguar. A mountain of muscles! You certainly don\u2019t want to meet him\
  \ alone in the dark\u2026 no chance to escape this mighty hunter with its sharp\
  \ teeth and claws.\n\nAfter 10 minutes the magic was over and \u201COnza\u201D was\
  \ disappearing in the thick bushes of the Pantanal. Funny, I thought. The animal\
  \ was not bothered about the 5 boats packed with tourists, observing every single\
  \ step of him. He is the real king and stood above everything.\n\nThe end of an\
  \ unforgettable day was near and while the boat engine was rattling in the background\
  \ we made our way back home."
