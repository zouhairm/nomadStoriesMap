Text: "The history and culture of certain places can permeate their every aspect.\
  \ Stepping into New York\u2019s Birdland Theater is like diving into sixty years\
  \ of Jazz music. Red velvet curtains and black and white photos decorate the room.\
  \ Trumpets, vintage microphones, saxophones, pianos... they\u2019ve all accompanied\
  \ the greatest jazz musicians who\u2019ve performed here and shared their rhythms.\
  \ Pieces of eternity hanging on the walls.\nFor me, New York has always been filled\
  \ with this list of ideas and images I\u2019ve gotten from movies, music and books.\
  \ Visiting for the first time made them real. And with each new visit, I\u2019ve\
  \ opened doors onto new images, other dreams. But Birdland takes me right back to\
  \ the pages of Jack Kerouac, to the music of Duke Ellington. \nThe place is already\
  \ filling up with travellers in the know, as well as regulars, and I just got my\
  \ \u201Cdrink ticket\u201D from the hostess. I\u2019ve been told I\u2019ll find\
  \ Peter at his usual spot at the far end of the bar for the Wednesday 5.30pm show.\n\
  I sit on a bar stool and, in the dim light, I make up stories of who the people\
  \ here could be and what their lives might be like. A tall woman with a Slavik profile\
  \ and short blond hair arrives with a musician. She seems artistic and is obviously\
  \ a regular here. She orders a Manhattan and chats with the bartender, a short man\
  \ dressed all in black, with a kind face and a gentle voice. He interrupts his conversation\
  \ and my thoughts to ask me if I need anything. I don\u2019t dare ask if Peter is\
  \ here and order a margarita, hoping it will bring me some Dutch courage. \nThis\
  \ is my chance to have a conversation with a real New Yorker. I don\u2019t want\
  \ to blow it by being too shy. Luckily I\u2019m early and when he arrives, he sees\
  \ me at the bar. Peter is a sixty-something man with a natural class and piercing\
  \ blue eyes. He speaks in a warm, welcoming voice, as if he\u2019s always wished\
  \ to meet me. Greetings and handshakes are exchanged and the topic of our mutual\
  \ friend is enough to break the ice. We are soon interrupted by the club manager\
  \ asking for silence as he introduces the band. \nEvery chance he gets - that is,\
  \ every time the music breaks to let the band leader introduce the next piece -\
  \ Peter gives me bits and pieces of wisdom about the place, the musicians, or the\
  \ music itself and asks me for my impressions. I\u2019m still too intimidated to\
  \ give any kind of smart or well-informed answer but that\u2019s fine, he\u2019\
  s just making sure I feel included.\nWe are listening to the Louis Armstrong Eternity\
  \ Band, who\u2019ve been playing here for about fifteen years, every single Wednesday.\
  \ They feel at home and it shows. If it wasn\u2019t for the few tables obviously\
  \ occupied by tourists and the waiters running from order to order, I\u2019d think\
  \ we were in someone\u2019s basement for a private show.\nWe\u2019ve all forgotten\
  \ the summer heat and the Manhattan frenzy outside; daily life escapees, we all\
  \ nod our heads and move our feet to the rhythm of the music. It\u2019s a whole\
  \ world inside a city. From what Peter is telling me, I gather his life is pretty\
  \ much about going from one of these New York universes to another. He goes to work\
  \ every day in the New York Public Library\u2019s writer\u2019s research division,\
  \ where he meets people from the writing and publishing world, whilst his job itself\
  \ is more related to the movie industry. Every story or anecdote he gives me is\
  \ a new piece of the New York puzzle for me to add to my collection. As I\u2019\
  m staying in town for a while, I\u2019ll have a chance to meet him again and continue\
  \ building my puzzle. For now, the music has ended and the next show is about to\
  \ start. We leave and land with a bump back in crazy, vibrant midtown Manhattan.\
  \ I watch Peter as he walks away, taking his own collection of puzzle pieces with\
  \ him, and I realize: every person walking these streets carries pieces of their\
  \ own."
