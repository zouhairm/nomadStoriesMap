Text: "We just drove off the boat and on our way to our accomodation when we were\
  \ welcomed with this burning red sunset which set the mood for a magical week long\
  \ holiday in Tasmania, pumped to explore this island full of nature and the wonders\
  \ i will stumble upon.  Camping was on the agender not even planning any spots so\
  \ just pointed on the map and said lets try here.  I did not expect to find somewhere\
  \ so beautiful the area is called \"bay of fires\" on the east coast of Tasmania,\
  \ the sand made of silica, so white, water crystal blue yet freezing cold perfect\
  \ for waking you up feeling energized.  But the rocks they were orange from the\
  \ algae truely beautiful and the sunsets making the blue water pop and the orange\
  \ rocks glow.  Our camp spot which is free, was only a few steps from the beach\
  \ access, only need to bring your own shower and sink and toilet paper.  3 days\
  \ we spent here, walking tracks, beach combing, exploring the rocks, snorkelling,\
  \ fishing and meeting new people around campfires.  Each day we went into town and\
  \ to explore surrounding beaches and tracks.\n  Bioluminance is know in Tasmania\
  \ as well, yet we did not see any i heard from some travellers it is around.  The\
  \ australia aurora is something i looked out for at the night time under the billion\
  \ of stars you could see so perfectly every night, making a perfect romantic walk.\
  \  Theres no light pollution so stargaze and chill all you like its amazing! \n\n\
  Being in Tasmania for 3 days already we heard from some campers some pretty places\
  \ to check out, Friendlys beach another spot you can camp at a small price from\
  \ the national parks.  To get there was only an hour away and we stopped in Bicheno\
  \ a small town on the way to get some supplies.  It's off the beaten track and we\
  \ go looking for a camp spot to find little wallabies hopping around and signs saying\
  \ wombats even known to roam around, these camp spots were more allocated and not\
  \ first in first serve, some spots even your own access to the beach if your lucky.\
  \  If your looking to stay at friendlys beach i recommend booking in advance as\
  \ spots fill up quickly.  The beach is long and still more white sand, just be careful\
  \ of the wildlife birds were nesting this time of year. \n\nWe set off in more seach\
  \ of this Tasmanian beauty, wondering how much better can it get.  Til then i was\
  \ blown away by a beach called Honeymoon Bay, just the place to stumble upon on\
  \ our 2 year anniversary with the man of my dreams. \n The bay was an array of colours\
  \ perfect clear blues, black mussels growing on rocks and green seaweed and kelp.\
  \  Honeymoon Bay has much warmer waters and we swam out to a rock island that had\
  \ some fish swimming around.  \nIn the area you can go to Coles Bay and dive for\
  \ abolone and crayfish, theres a marina there and icecream shop popular with travellers\
  \ or take a cruise to Wineglass Bay, or you can hike to a lookout and there's access\
  \ down, i heard its well worth the walk, bring your hiking boots as well. \n\nFrom\
  \ the East Coast we decided it was time to go look at something different, we went\
  \ to Marakoopa caves near Mole Creek, the story of how it was found and the beauty\
  \ of an underground river and even glow worms made the drive out so worth it.  In\
  \ the area theres also another cave yet we left it too late to visit.\n\nTheres\
  \ a rich history and beauty to how unspoiled Tasmania really is, you cannot just\
  \ do everything in a week, theres much nature to see, farm gates to visit, buy local\
  \ produce and cheese and wine trails galore. Learn about australias convict settlement\
  \ in Port Arthur and how it was built. Chill and go at your own pace plan or dont\
  \ plan you'll find the unexpected. \n Tasmanias cleanest air certainly got to us\
  \ and i recommend people see this \"apple isle\" of Australia you'll certainly pinch\
  \ yourself."
