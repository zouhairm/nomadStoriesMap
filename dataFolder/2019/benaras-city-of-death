Text: "I was hardly able to write.\n\nI plunged myself under a shower of cold water\
  \ at 3 am in the night. I got dressed, packed my bag with essentials, a camera and\
  \ a diary to write and left the dorm.\n\nI had arrived at the city just the previous\
  \ day, crossed a bridge in prussian blue sky, in an auto under moon light. Cows\
  \ soiled ancient town\u2019s shuttered streets. People smoked tea light. I checked\
  \ in the Benaras H. University\u2019s dormitory. \n\nI walked to the ghats from\
  \ dorm, taking pictures. People are sleeping on the steps of the ghat. I climbed\
  \ stepped buildings in concrete and found myself on the terrace of a balcony. I\
  \ sat and made a sketch of the river front in the dark. People gathered slowly.\
  \ Cows surround a tree. \n\nThe day I arrived, I wondered about people\u2019s lives\
  \ in these maze like streets that foreigners and saints walked alike. I saw burnings\
  \ ghats in funeral fire. It rained bulls in narrow streets. \n\nLight pierced me\
  \ from all directions reaching depths unexplored. Something is calling. My soul\
  \ flew exposed. I found myself among hundreds of people gathered in time at the\
  \ ghat, walking across repetitions. Somebody might have been where I was and seen\
  \ what I had seen. As the sun rose, I stepped on a boat. \n\nI met an old foreigner\
  \ couple at the ghat during Sandhya aarati, the night of the day I arrived. The\
  \ man from Cuzco had stayed in Varanasi for more than 10 years and had happened\
  \ to return just that day after 20 years\u2019 time. Kahlil Gibran, his favourite\
  \ was destined. The lady from London told Sai Baba was calling me. I went along\
  \ to their place. Classical musicians were playing. In her eyes\u2019 deep oceans,\
  \ I felt the certainty of seeing a soul for the last time.\n\nPeople are like cells\
  \ which do not have the understanding of the purpose they serve achieve. Sounds\
  \ from bells and vocal chants merged in rhythm. From middle of this river flowing\
  \ from times unknown, I looked at the abundance of truth at the ghat. People came\
  \ lost to the city which took a part of them away. Decorated lifted lamps of flames\
  \ up the sky in dance like movement from one side. The other side of the river kept\
  \ telling me another story, of land untouched that had seen the city being built\
  \ from ashes. \n\nThe day I arrived, I couldn\u2019t get a piece of it at all. A\
  \ part of me wanted to leave the city. After a chat with my best friend I decided\
  \ to stay.\n\nWater splashes erase memories in the boat adrift. I hear everything\
  \ I stare. Birds fly moon high. Tides fall and raise high, producing intelligent\
  \ versions every present of dancing emotions. Battery\u2019s destined dead for events,\
  \ yet the urge of expression is satisfied. I sent mom a text message. I lost the\
  \ part of self that day that wanted to leave. \n\nYoga is instructed at the ghat.\
  \ People exhale inhaled; coughing illness of bodies. Sounds rose \u2013 Jo prakriti\
  \ ne diya hai; uska aanand lene ka poora adhikar aapko hai. Beautiful understandings\
  \ of civilization so early. I sat near an old man at the ghat who was getting his\
  \ stuff ready. \n\nKids holding hands walk in youthful comfort of the day to school\
  \ across all of this. It is important to question. I rose and walked towards the\
  \ river and at the last step, silence met. Some left behind activity. I wouldn\u2019\
  t write. \n\nI was hardly able to write."
