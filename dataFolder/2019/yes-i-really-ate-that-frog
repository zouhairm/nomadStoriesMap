Text: "What comes to your mind when you think about the weirdest food combinations?\
  \ Pineapple on pizza? Popcorn and ketchup? Or maybe fries dipped in honey? Here's\
  \ one more from me: frog and Turkey.\n\nI couldn't find it in Berlin, Vienna, Amsterdam\
  \ or even in Paris. Both historical and modern with their impressive architecture,\
  \ they greet you with a cold handshake and at the end of the day you realize that\
  \ you still remain like a stranger to them. They are being reprinted into guides'\
  \ colorful pages that voracious visitors will then hold in their hands to finally\
  \ see all those old districts, monuments and palaces in life-size scale.  Cities\
  \ that seem a bit exhausted, so used to constant interest, but utterly exploited\
  \ and so easily left behind. Cities that were supposed to left us in awe but eventually\
  \ they left us just indifferent. Cities where sometimes you can see everything except\
  \ life. \n\nThis is why there's probably nothing more awkward than a person with\
  \ social anxiety encountering Turkish society. On November 10th, 2016 this adventure\
  \ was about to begin for yet another person and it happened to be me. My father\
  \ picked me up to the airport in the middle of the night so I could catch my flight,\
  \ my mother pretended she was not worried and here I was, sitting in a plane to\
  \ Turkey. I was about to visit my boyfriend's country for the very first time.\n\
  \nThere are nearly 15 million of people that circulate in Istanbul's hot blood.\
  \ When I finally landed in Atat\xFCrk's airport, I felt like all of them were waiting\
  \ just for me. Never in my life have I seen such crowds - people were trying to\
  \ get into the metro, to cross a street on red light despite bad traffic or to fight\
  \ for dominance on this concrete's jungle epicentre, the sidewalk.  All this to\
  \ the accompaniment of m\xFCezzin's singing from the nearest mosque. I had an impression\
  \ that the air that I was breathing in was warmer that the one I was exhaling, everything\
  \ was just buzzing with life. I was both petrified and thrilled - a bunch of Emre's\
  \ friends wanted to meet me. They not only wanted to finally meet the girlfriend\
  \ of their friend. They also wanted to see a yabanc\u0131, Turkish equivalent of\
  \ a gringo. Yes, I was a foreign woman in the Middle East.\n\nTurks, even if they\
  \ see you for the first time, rarely greet you with a cold handshake. In fact, they\
  \ hug you, from both sides, and feel very comfortable with physical touch in order\
  \ to show you their sympathy or when they simply want to mess with you. Apart of\
  \ that, Turkish people are a collective society - they adore spending their time\
  \ in large groups, so it's very normal to go and eat lunch with ten other people\
  \ and then drink tea in a cafe nearby. And then go, all together, to somebody's\
  \ house and drink even more tea. \n\nAs a person suffering from social anxiety,\
  \ at the beginning remaining sane in those kind of conditions was very difficult\
  \ for me. I wasn't used to big crowds and large groups of people hanging out together.\
  \  Before meeting some of my boyfriend's schoolmates or neighbours, I felt panicked,\
  \ especially because I was usually the one being in the limelight and unable to\
  \ speak in their language. Since I come from country where we usually stay reserved\
  \ towards people that we don't know very well, their openness and warmth were very\
  \ new for me. Slowly I realized that Turkish hospitality and the sense of community\
  \ help me to fight my worst fears. Talking to local people about their ordinary\
  \ life, their country\u2019s issues and their culture was beneficial. Day by day,\
  \ by getting closer to them, I felt more and more close to my own self.  \n\nSometimes\
  \ people eat very strange things when they travel. I wasn't an exception -  the\
  \ Mark Twain's frog in a form of social anxiety that was waiting there to be eaten\
  \ since forever, was finally eaten here in Turkey. \n\nAnd it turned out to be delicious."
