Text: "It was early morning when I lifted my eyes open, only to smile at the view\
  \ from the window. The site of the sunrise between the mountains lifted my spirits.\
  \ And I realized, I had finally made it..! \nAs a woman, travelling solo could be\
  \ a task. In India, it's even worse. But I had to break the stereotypes, and see\
  \ for myself whether it was actually dangerous or adventurous! That's where the\
  \ magic began. \nI took a bus from New Delhi to a hill station called Bhuntar in\
  \ Himachal Pradesh. A 12 hour overnight journey should have been exhausting but\
  \ I felt a different energy inside my body. I was calm and peaceful. I wasn't tired\
  \ at all with the uncomfortable but journey. Infact, I enjoyed my morning breakfast\
  \ in a long while!  It was a tiny shack that served tea and noodles at the river\
  \ bend. What better a view with warm food and the sun kissing your skin? Well, it\
  \ was the best I had in years! \nIn order to understand the place, I moved around\
  \ a bit, and asked the locals about places to visit. And the loving lady at the\
  \ shack shared with me a place that she called her paradise. Hearing her talk about\
  \ the place with utmost glitter in her eyes, I knew I had to get myself there. She\
  \ guided me with the route and gave me her blessings. Trust me, for a 60 year old,\
  \ she seemed decently young to me!\nNow all I had to do was to catch the next local\
  \ bus, towards Barsheni, a village that links a couple of other routes to different\
  \ villages of the Parvati Valley. Hopping to the closest empty window seat, I plugged\
  \ in my earphones and played all my favorites from my playlist and enjoyed the drive.\
  \ It took me 3 decent hours to get there. And guess what!? The clouds were gracious\
  \ enough to make me witness my first snowfall..! But it became a task when I was\
  \ informed that no taxi would be running that had to take me to the paradise that\
  \ lady told me about. \nOn inquiring with a couple of people around, I decided to\
  \ walk. A group of friends from a different city joined me as well. Hiking up the\
  \ snow paradise was all I'd ever wish for! My first solo journey with my first snowfall.\
  \ What more could I have asked for? \nThe trail towards this winter snowland was\
  \ a four hour non stop hike. No pit stops,  no shop to take a break. I had pushed\
  \ my limits and faced my biggest fear, heights. As I hiked my way to the top to\
  \ this beautiful village called Tosh, I had this great awakening. I had a calling,\
  \ a calling that made me fall in love with mother nature. She was beautiful, she\
  \ was calm. Her tranquility filled me with the most pleasant energy. \nBreaking\
  \ the monotony and stereotypes of the urban life by opting to have this travel experience\
  \ was one of my best journies till date! Sometimes taking the leap of faith and\
  \ trusting your instincts could result in you having the best time of your lives!\
  \ \nI believe everyone, should at least once, travel solo and face their wildest\
  \ and biggest fears. Obstructions and hurdles will always be a part and parcel of\
  \ life. It's how you cross it,  that counts."
