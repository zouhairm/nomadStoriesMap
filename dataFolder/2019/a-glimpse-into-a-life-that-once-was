Text: "It was an eerie feeling as I stepped up the cobble stones to an old run down\
  \ room that had seen better days. The paint was coming off the walls, the stove\
  \ needed an upgrade and the bed that was in the corner looked as if it was going\
  \ to break in a matter of seconds. \n\nWe were greeted by this warm, loving lady.\
  \ She was so frail. Her back hunched over as she held her walker so tightly with\
  \ her thin arms. As she moved around I was amazed at how much weight her legs took\
  \ as they looked like they would snap if she twisted in the wrong direction. Yet,\
  \ she carried herself with so much pride. Her hair was immaculately done, her floral\
  \ dress was buttoned all the way up with the collar neatly tucked over and her apron\
  \ had not a stain in sight. \n\nThere was so much love in her eyes. So much excitement.\
  \ So much emotion. As we sat around the room I listened to the voices of those I\
  \ had only just met yet they carried such a familiar feeling to me. It was as if\
  \ I had known them my whole life. So soothing, so comforting. \n\nThere was so much\
  \ history in this room. So many emotions were soaring through. This was my Nonna's\
  \ first time back at this place since she had migrated to Australia with her immediate\
  \ family. Her first time re-connecting with her Aunty since the move 60 odd years\
  \ ago. The only Aunty that still lived. As I looked at them, my heart felt the love\
  \ and compassion that was shown in front of it. The memories flooding back for them\
  \ both. The years coming back. It was a strong feeling for my Nonna as she looked\
  \ at this lady in front of her and could only see an identical figure of her mother-\
  \ the one she had lost at such a young age. This beautiful lady was an exact replica\
  \ of her own mother. My Nonna owed a lot to this lady.\n\nMemories flooding in as\
  \ they continued to share stories of when Nonna was growing up and what life was\
  \ like back then. They both continued to laugh as they remember three families being\
  \ squished into this room, or as they referred to it 'their home'. Everyone lined\
  \ up on the ground like sardines, to ensure they could all fit as the night passed\
  \ on. It's no wonder why my Nonna has been so appreciative with her life back in\
  \ Australia. What her parents did for her. What her parents did for her family.\
  \ They made the big move in order to provide for a better life for them all. For\
  \ the future generations.  \n\nAs I looked at my Nonna's eyes I could see the raw\
  \ emotion that was there. So many stories were seen with those eyes. So many stories\
  \ were experienced with those eyes. The piercing bright blue continued to sparkle\
  \ as her smile would fill her face.  As the memories were recalled. As the emotions\
  \ were felt. Hearts throbbing, tears flooding, joy filling our surrounds.\n\nAs\
  \ we made our way back down the cobblestones there was a sense of heart ache. A\
  \ sense of pain. None of us wanted to leave this beautiful Aunty who many had just\
  \ met. As we waved our goodbyes, it was sad to think this would be the last time\
  \ I would ever see her. That Nonna would ever see her. They parted ways for the\
  \ final time in this life in the hope they would be reconnected in another time.\
  \ In another life."
