Text: "Iceland is like Sweden\u2019s weird cousin that shows up at all the big holidays.\
  \ It looks more like the moon or a newly-discovered boiling planet than the other\
  \ Nordic countries, yet it shares the same ancient gods and speaks some variant\
  \ of an old mother tongue. It\u2019s intriguing, mysterious, remote, cold and hot\
  \ (simultaneously)\u2026 It\u2019s the one who tells all the cool stories at family\
  \ gatherings, tales so far-fetched that we\u2019re not sure whether they\u2019re\
  \ real or not.\n\nIt\u2019s roughly the size of Kentucky (or, the size of Ireland\
  \ and Belgium combined), but with a population smaller than the city of Nice; so\
  \ once you leave Reykjavik virtually everywhere feels like you\u2019re in the middle\
  \ of Nowhere.\n\nOne corner looks like a troll nursery, while another, a boiling\
  \ cauldron ready to burst its seams and spew scalding water or lava or unicorn entrails\u2026\
  \ one never knows.\n\nMy first observation: there are no trees here. But: black\
  \ mountains and weird green rolling hills pop up from flat expanses, appearing out\
  \ of the fog like they\u2019ve just sprung from the depths of some grim faery tale.\
  \ It\u2019s like Kansas meets Mars or the Moon, in black (and green) and gray, but\
  \ there are still literally no trees, just a smattering of what looks like wheatgrass\
  \ and moss-covered boulder fields. And rainbows appear on a moment\u2019s notice,\
  \ since it\u2019s drizzling then sunny\u2026not terribly unlike New England weather.\
  \ But with ink-black earth. And volcanoes. And maybe trolls.\n\nI shot on the order\
  \ of 600 photos in 3 days, beginning that Monday morn. How? When the landscape and\
  \ the light are otherworldly, and the sky shows a different side every 8 minutes,\
  \ even a simple snapshot out the window of a hotel room has a mood and a texture\
  \ like a painting.\n\nSo on this new day, when the dreariness looked like it wanted\
  \ to thwart an entire stopover, I woke up and steeled myself for the worst of elements.\
  \ At brekkie, though, the clouds broke. For a precious few moments the sun appeared\
  \ as if it would stay the day\u2026 alas, by the time I was ready to embark, the\
  \ skies darkened and Thor reigned (and rained and rained). Undaunted, I set out\
  \ (rather, there is quite literally NOTHING to do here except look at nature, so\
  \ I went anyway). First stop: Kirkjufellsfoss.\n\nThe tour bus and teeming tourists\
  \ turn me off at first (as do the rain and wind). But the clouds momentarily break,\
  \ the bus leaves, and I am left with a living photograph before me\u2026 The shot,\
  \ worth it. Then the skies then darken and it begins to hail.\n\nHailstorm, brief,\
  \ I set off again, towards the seaside town of Stykkish\xF3lmur, situated on the\
  \ northern side of the peninsula, then continue my Sn\xE6fellsnes loop with a stop\
  \ at the renowned B\xFA\xF0akirkja, a dark-brown church built in the early 1700\u2019\
  s by a Swedish merchant, torn down and rebuilt (twice!) before the mid-1800\u2019\
  s. Made only made more stunning by its site (mountains on one side, the wild North\
  \ Atlantic on the other) and the magic Icelandic skies.\n\nBy midafternoon on that\
  \ first day, cold and wet were factors by which I had stopped measuring my well-being.\
  \ The weather began as gray, moved to alternately downpouring and sunny, shifted\
  \ to gale-force winds (in which, at one point, I had to hold onto my rental car\
  \ to avoid getting flung off a cliff), hail, more rain, then brooding fog. More\
  \ sacrifices to the gods of Gore-Tex. Nj\xF6r\xF0r (Njord), Norse god of sea and\
  \ wind, is ever-present.\n\n\nI\u2019ve found that the most amazing experiences\
  \ I\u2019ve had travelling are the ones not in a guide book, but rather what arises\
  \ when you least expect it: fresh kanelbulle from a local baker; a stranger coming\
  \ to your aid when you are out of options; a kind local guiding you to the best\
  \ view in a town you can\u2019t pronounce; deep sleep in an old dirt-floored cabin\
  \ beside a stream; a paddle down a canal beside an urban island once used as the\
  \ Royal hunting grounds; a hike through rainbow-coloured steaming earth; a hail\
  \ storm then a magnificent rainbow on a volcanic coastline in a village with 12\
  \ houses."
