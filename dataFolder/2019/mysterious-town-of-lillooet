Text: "Excitement, curiosity, rapture, strangely pleasant fear. I get all these mixed\
  \ feelings when entering a town. Town that seems abandoned at first sight, filled\
  \ with mysterious atmosphere, town of Lillooet.  \n\nEven the views on the way to\
  \ this place are suggesting what unforgettable experience is awaiting me. Beautifully\
  \ odd nature is leaving me speechless and I cannot take my eyes away from the scene\
  \ around me. I have seen many beautiful places but this one has something special.\
  \ It makes me feel like it's keeping a secret and I just want to find out what is\
  \ it. Those hills, valleys, water, flora\u2026 it all just matches together so perfectly.\
  \ I can see, smell and feel the symphony all around.  \n\nI pass a wooden sign supported\
  \ by a heap of rocks that says: Lillooet - guaranteed rugged. And I must admit,\
  \ the sign doesn't lie. Wild West style building of Reynold's Hotel welcomes me\
  \ and it gives me a first hint of ambience I'm about to witness. As I continue down\
  \ to the village, I pass by small wooden houses of subtle colors. Trucks and vintage\
  \ vehicles are parking in front of them and they help to create that feeling of\
  \ mystery. You know, the kind you see in the movies.   \n\nDriving further, I see\
  \ a House of Jade on one side, Museum of Lillooet on the other. The cute little\
  \ houses are mostly little stores selling native crafts, antiques or even real estate\
  \ agency. It is all so authentic and believable. I can see houses standing alone\
  \ far away, up in the hills. No neighbours, but apparently occupied. As I get to\
  \ the end, I come to the old suspension bridge. It was built in 1913 and made of\
  \ wood and steel. On the top of steel construction, I see a nest with eagles in\
  \ it. No wonder they chose this place, it's magical.\n\nThe longest river in Canadian\
  \ province of British Columbia flows under this bridge, Fraser River. When I look\
  \ to the other side, I see another bridge. This one is old railway bridge. It's\
  \ quite far but from where I'm standing, the view is perfect. Among those mountains\
  \ and above the massive river, it looks stunning. It feels like the time has stopped\
  \ here. \n\nHowever, sadly, it didn't. Sun is about to start setting down and I\
  \ just realized how tired I feel. I go to my car and back through the village, passing\
  \ by Reynold's Hotel, turning right and heading to my final destination, the Lodge\
  \ and RV Park. I have a room booked so I just quickly run to the front desk which\
  \ is located in one of the RVs in front of the lodge on the parking lot. I get my\
  \ keys and go find my room. It is dark outside by this point and I can hardly see\
  \ anything. But I just can't help myself and have to stand for a little while on\
  \ a terrace in front of my room. Even though I cannot see anything, I enjoy this\
  \ moment so much, it is so peaceful here. I can hear gentle breeze and crickets\
  \ chirping. \n\nNext morning, I wake up at six, I cannot wait to get outside and\
  \ enjoy the views around me. I take a quick shower and head out of my room. Only\
  \ now I can see the true astonishment surrounding the lodge. Majestic mountains,\
  \ green nature, blue sky. I see a few RVs next to the motel, people in are still\
  \ sleeping and it's so quiet here. I decided to have breakfast and enjoy this place\
  \ while I have it for myself. I go to one of the camper-like houses in front of\
  \ the lodge. It is a small kitchen where I can choose from cereals and milk or bread\
  \ with strawberries jam. I grab a slice of bread and a huge mug of coffee and go\
  \ outside enjoy my breakfast on the stairs. The sun is already out, pleasantly touching\
  \ my face and keeping me warm so early in the morning. I sit there and cannot believe\
  \ this place. I just never want to leave."
