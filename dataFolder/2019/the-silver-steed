Text: "\"I could get any one of you to do anything.\" Richard shouted, over the band\
  \ performing their rendition of ACDC's Highway to Hell, \"Absolutely anything!\"\
  \ He chuckled, his smile wide, stroking his grey beard with his tattooed arms crossed.\
  \ Richard sat, shades down over his eyes, and legs straddled either side of him,\
  \ as if he never left his motorcycle. Instead, we were sitting around a club bar\
  \ table, in a mechanic's workshop converted for tonight\u2019s celebrations. I returned\
  \ his smile and nodded, looking around at the rest of our party, a rag tag mix of\
  \ Australians, newlywed Spaniards, a lone Brazilian businessman and an Italian gelato\
  \ maestro. This was our last night in Los Angeles, and a farewell to the man that\
  \ had dragged us some two and a half thousand miles across America\u2019s mother\
  \ road, Route 66.\n\nHe had taken forty-eight tours before ours. On a road through\
  \ tidy towns in Illinois to dusty, forgotten trails in New Mexico, riding across\
  \ the heartland of America on shiny late-model motorcycles. The bright metallic\
  \ sheen of the bikes racing against the brick, concrete and pavement, of a road\
  \ that had been revered in songs, and then shattered, re-aligned and broken as it\
  \ was surpassed by a highway system.\n\nFor fifteen days, Richard had taken us on\
  \ a one-way ride on his Route 66. To those places he had remembered from family\
  \ road trips, the iconic American drive-in, guarded by a Giant clutching a spaceship,\
  \ a big rocking chair, freshly painted for each tour season, and past a swimming\
  \ hole home to a wooden Blue Whale, crafted from a man's love for his wife. Onwards\
  \ he led us on his silver steed, through prehistoric canyons to the desert, where\
  \ only traces of Route 66 remained as fragmented road bed, hidden beneath wooden\
  \ telephone poles standing upright alongside a petrified forest.\n\nRichard pulls\
  \ off his sunglasses, revealing dark eyes set in a face lined from time spent in\
  \ the sun and weathered from the wind on the road. He starts to sing loudly, and\
  \ almost in tune, with the band. The route from Chicago to Santa Monica was identical\
  \ for each journey, but every tour Richard claimed was different. A unique and unpredictable\
  \ combination of motorcycles, weather and people. This was what had lured him back\
  \ from his beach-side retirement. On two or three wheels, his guests will travel\
  \ through anything from soft snow in early fall to blazing summer heat, exposed\
  \ to a road brought back from American memories. \n\nRichard had guided our bikes\
  \ to each landmark, carefully lining up our row of motorcycles through the trickle\
  \ of campervans and family cars. The bar and shield stood over a man and his rabbit\
  \ ranch in Stanton. It watched over a couple looking after a family legacy in Gay\
  \ Parita. It protected an abandoned gold mining town, over run by donkeys, in Oatman.\
  \ Greetings and good byes were exchanged through solid handshakes and firm hugs.\
  \ Souvenirs were gifted and guestbooks signed to ensure the survival of those that\
  \ made a welcome to the American dream their business. \n\nThe motorcycles had eagerly\
  \ devoured every mile, highway and twisted road.  From that first chilly morning\
  \ ride to watching the colors change as the sun set on the Grand Canyon, our time\
  \ with Richard on Route 66 was complete. Watching the band finish through their\
  \ last chorus, I think back to an early morning in Amarillo. To a bare paddock in\
  \ which ten Cadillacs stood sinking into the clay, rear exposed and rusted in the\
  \ Texan sun. Richard had handed me a fluorescent green can of spray paint and just\
  \ pointed to the cars. A silent command to leave my mark on his Route 66."
