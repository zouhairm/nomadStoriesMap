Text: "The medieval executioner approached us, his face hidden beneath a red hood.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t Halloween. It was the restaurant\u2019s employee uniform.\n\n\u201C\
  Where are you girls from?\u201D\n\nOur responses went: Germany; Germany; California.\
  \ \n\n\u201CNice!\u201D He removed his mask. He appeared our age, a twenty-something.\
  \ Much friendlier-looking than seconds ago. \u201CI\u2019m Jakub!\u201D \n\nMy companions\
  \ and I introduced ourselves. Veronica, the graduate student. Kristina, an aspiring\
  \ model. And me, the unemployed Californian: Sophie. I\u2019d met Veronica and Kristina\
  \ an hour ago. We were roommates for the weekend, staying at a hostel just outside\
  \ Prague\u2019s Old Town. We were eager to try the local cuisine and wound up here,\
  \ drawn in by the restaurant\u2019s outdoor swinging tables. \n\nBetween Jakub\u2019\
  s costume and those tables, it was possible we had fallen for a tourist trap, but\
  \ we didn\u2019t mind. It was part of the place\u2019s charm.  \n\nJakub provided\
  \ puzzle games to keep us occupied during our wait for a table. He joked with us\
  \ while we ate. As his shift ended, he invited us to join him and his friends for\
  \ drinks. He offered to drive since the pub was a few miles away. \n\nI shared a\
  \ hesitant look with Veronica and Kristina.\n\nI was born and raised in a Cambodian\
  \ culture with three critical rules when it came to strangers.\n\n1. Do not talk\
  \ to strangers. \n2. Do not accept things from strangers. \n3. Do not go into a\
  \ stranger\u2019s car.\n\nMy decision to backpack across Europe revolved around\
  \ meeting new people and experiencing other cultures, so breaking rule number one\
  \ was a given. Jakub\u2019s invitation was exactly what I wanted\u2014a chance to\
  \ leave the beaten path and hang out with the locals.\n\nBut to agree to enter a\
  \ stranger\u2019s car\u2026 I could already hear my older sister yelling, asking\
  \ if I was suicidal.\n\nVeronica and Kristina\u2019s silence suggested we shared\
  \ similar concerns about Jakub's possible ulterior motives. \n\nJakub waited for\
  \ an answer. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to sound rude with an outright no.\n\nI blurted,\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019ll only go if you let me drive.\u201D \n\nClever me. \n\nJakub wouldn\u2019\
  t trust a stranger, especially a foreigner, to drive his car. This was where we\
  \ would part ways.\n\nBut without a second thought, Jakub handed me his keys and\
  \ said, \u201CSure.\u201D\n\nShoot. \n\nI gave my friends an apologetic look, although\
  \ they seemed more excited by this turn of events than disappointed. \n\nI reassured\
  \ myself that since I was behind the wheel, we would be fine. Even though I\u2019\
  d broken rule number three, I was in control.\n\nAs I situated myself in the driver\
  \ seat, I noticed the stick shift.\n\nJakub hadn\u2019t mentioned it. Of course\
  \ he wouldn\u2019t. This was Europe. Everyone drove manual. \n\nDouble shoot. \n\
  \nMost of my experience operating a stick shift involved stalling out at stoplights.\
  \ I was glad it was dark. None of the others could see me panicking.\n\nStarting\
  \ in first gear was the most difficult. I eased off the clutch and accelerated.\
  \ To my surprise, no juddering or stalling engine. I didn\u2019t know if I could\
  \ accomplish this again. I shifted upward, and for the next ten stress-filled minutes,\
  \ I avoided dropping into first gear. My only stops were rolling-stops. \n\nJakub\
  \ said, \u201CTurn right, we\u2019re here.\u201D \n\nNo dents. No ticket. No stalling.\
  \ Mission accomplished. \n\nI let out a deep breath. Conversation had filled the\
  \ entire ride and I couldn\u2019t recall a single topic. I\u2019d gone from fearing\
  \ Jakub to fearing for Jakub's and my friends' safety due to my driving.\n\nIn the\
  \ bar, Jakub proposed we join him on the dance floor. No hesitant looks this time\u2014\
  Kristina, Veronica, and I accepted his invitation.\n\nLater, alone at our table,\
  \ I sipped on a beer recommended by Jakub\u2019s friends and watched our host. He\
  \ was dancing alone, eyes closed. He looked content. I reflected on how the night\
  \ had unfolded, feeling guilty for my doubts. I\u2019d been overly wary, unable\
  \ to trust a stranger. Jakub had been the opposite, not only inviting us into his\
  \ personal life, but also allowing someone he barely knew to drive his car. And\
  \ here I began to appreciate that this adventure hadn't happened because of me taking\
  \ a risk, but through a stranger\u2019s trust."
