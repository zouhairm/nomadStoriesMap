Text: "I had been looking outside the window when I saw a board signalling Malawi..\
  \ I knew this was my stop, I needed to get off the bus  next to me was a lady who\
  \ didn't speak English she had been trying to strike a conversation between throughout\
  \ our journey in Swahili.. We found a way to communicate she would say three things\
  \ and I would choose one as my response..\n\n\nI called out Malawi, she did the\
  \ rest for me telling the driver to stop on the side so I can catch buses to Malawi\
  \ she had pointed out to me. As I got off the bus a guy screamed Malawi I said yes\
  \ he took my bag carried it on his shoulders with me running behind him we reached\
  \ a bus going to the Songwe border...  \n\nOn a seat in front of mine was this beautiful\
  \ lady formally dressed in powder blue formal clothes, once in a while she would\
  \ be on her phone with her mommy although the rest of the conversation was in Swahili;\
  \ my instincts told me she could speak English. \n\nAn hour into the bus journey\
  \ I nudged her, asking if she could speak English.. She delightfully said yes my\
  \ sister I can but my English is not very good.. That's all I needed to make the\
  \ rest of my journey easier...\n\nI explained to her I was on my way to Malawi and\
  \ was hoping I could cross the border that evening... She explained that the border\
  \ closes at 6pm it was around 7pm.. She paused and sadly looked at me and said:\"\
  I am so sorry I am poor my sister, if not I would accommodate you at my house, we\
  \ have family over\".... I responded and said it's ok all I need for her to do is\
  \ find a nice decent place to sleep. Although it was late she wanted to bring me\
  \ dinner she explained that having been on the road the whole day I needed something\
  \ to eat and not go to bed on an empty stomach...\n\nWhen we reached the border\
  \ town she took my bag called her husband who owns a motorbike to come and transport\
  \ me to the lodge, when I protested she responded I shouldn't worry it's close,\
  \ she will walk... It was my first time on a back of the bike I climbed on the husband\
  \ took me to this beautiful and clean lodge.. It was around 5$ per night she asked\
  \ of the price was OK as she could ask them to give me a discount I told her it\
  \ was fine, I had the money... I told her I was too tired and needed to sleep and\
  \ she shouldn't worry about dinner I was OK...\n\nThe next morning as I was preparing\
  \ to leave all packed I called Enes to thank her for everything she has done for\
  \ me, she insisted that she was on her way I should wait for her... She arrived\
  \ carrying a cute basket with her beautiful set of dishes and a flask told me she\
  \ couldn't let me leave without eating breakfast.. It was freshly made chapattis\
  \ and chai tea, I got overwhelmed by her kindness and warmth, and started crying..\
  \ She panicked and said \"my sister are you ok please please tell me what's wrong,\
  \ do you not have money. Please tell me is everything OK you are my sister\"...\
  \ I told her there was nothing wrong I am just overwhelmed by her love and kindness..\
  \ She dismissed me and went on to tell me her husband has found me a boda boda guy(motorcycle\
  \ taxi guy) who's going to take me to the border post.. He will wait for me until\
  \ I get my passport stamped, change money and carry my bag onto Malawi and will\
  \ not leave my side until I get into a taxi into Mzuzu for only 1000 Tanzanian shillings.\n\
  \nHe left his bike and we crossed the border on foot, leaving his bike on Tanzania\
  \ side and carried my bag on his shoulder, helped me get a Malawian sim card, water\
  \ to drink and took me to a taxi to Mzuzu only then left."
