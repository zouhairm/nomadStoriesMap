Text: "It\u2019s 1885. July 26th to be exact. I wander down Mane Street of Pioneertown\
  \ California with Louise, my city-slicker friend from L.A.\n\nLouise bends down\
  \ to tie up her boot while I peer into Mane Street Hotel\u2019s window. There\u2019\
  s a sign saying there are rooms upstairs but the teacups on the table look untouched\
  \ and there\u2019s a decrepit piano in the corner collecting dust. I picture a ghost\
  \ sliding her bony fingers along the keys late at night, playing to no one. The\
  \ hotel is eerie, to say the least. \n\nWe amble further down the road to the Wagon\
  \ Wheel Saloon, boasting \u201Cfree beer tomorrow.\u201D I take a seat on the porch\
  \ and bask in the relentless sun. There\u2019s no one around. It\u2019s as if the\
  \ town has run out of beer. \n\nNext door, in the Saddlery we find a leather smith\
  \ hard at work. His glasses are poised on the bridge of his nose; his attention\
  \ focused on the hook and eye in his hands. After admiring the saddles, we excuse\
  \ ourselves and walk outside. \n\nI look over yonder, past the wagons and the cacti.\
  \ Something catches my eye. It\u2019s a wooden shack of some kind. On closer inspection,\
  \ I read the sign, \u201CTown Haul. Ocupyied.\u201D I can\u2019t help but chuckle\
  \ at the wash closet before me. It seems that cowboys have a sense of humor that\
  \ is ironically quite dry.\n\nWe pass a few stores selling wares but the pottery\
  \ barn perplexes me. Why do cowboys need pottery? It sounds like a joke I might\
  \ hear if I head to the saloon later tonight. As I admire the trinkets in the adjacent\
  \ store, I realize I\u2019m searching for one thing in particular: a classic \u201C\
  Live, Love, Laugh\u201D knitted on a tea cozy or written on a towel. This saying\
  \ seems to be a common thread in small-town gift shops, but alas I find no such\
  \ thing, perhaps because it\u2019s 1885. I giggle as I think what the cowboy equivalent\
  \ of such a phrase might be. \u201CSaddle, Saloon, Skedaddle.\u201D\n\nWe\u2019\
  re back at the General Store on the very edge of town. I turn around to bid the\
  \ place goodbye and make the leap back into 2019.\n\nIt\u2019s time to wet my whistle\
  \ at Pappy and Harriet\u2019s, the local watering hole for the tourists passing\
  \ by. The place is packed, which is to be expected on a Saturday night as many well-known\
  \ bands perform in the venue. Live music floods the saloon and groups of people\
  \ chat animatedly over a beer. We join the waitlist for a table.\n\nI am surprised\
  \ to discover that Pappy and Harriet\u2019s was a former biker burrito bar called\
  \ Cantina back in 1946, when the town was founded by Hollywood investors. After\
  \ making over 50 films and T.V. shows, Hollywood deserted the set and now the place\
  \ exists as a touristic treasure and hipster hotspot.  \n\nAs I watch the band jamming\
  \ onstage, I feel a pang of nostalgia. Pioneertown, a preserved, imaginary town\
  \ in the desert is in fact very real and still stands as a testament of how beautiful\
  \ it is to leave the past behind."
