Text: "\u201CThird time lucky\u201D \u2013 I said when an alarm woke me up on 5 am.\
  \ I was stubborn and determined as the mountains I am heading to conquer. A snowstorm\
  \ made us turn around on the first time. Second time the snow crust was not solid\
  \ enough to walk on it, so we could not overcome even the foothills. I encompassed\
  \ an ardor of adventurer and wait-and-see of a hunter when we had a ride to the\
  \ trailhead. \nA spot of rosy sunrise spread over a half-empty parking lot when\
  \ I took my backpack out of the car. We passed the caravans of families and loving\
  \ couples leisurely walking around the lake and kept on going directly to the forest.\
  \ Short-but-steep trail through the woods was a crowd repellent.\nSoon we reached\
  \ a series of small peak-framed alpine lakes. We silently enjoyed it. Not only because\
  \ postcard views were majestic and made us reverently muted. Also because we were\
  \ out of breath after a slippery climb. I had been thinking about the tribes of\
  \ natives living here years ago. This scenery was a backyard for them.\nSweet-smelling\
  \ spruces ceased hugging us when the forest trail ended up with a portal to the\
  \ stony tundra. Land over the treeline opens space to explore. That was the entrance\
  \ to the hiking along the spine of the Continental Divide.\nI was born on another\
  \ Continental Divide, between Europe and Asia. Ural Mountains are a belt similar\
  \ to Rocky Mountains, but older and less come-at-able. Since the Urals are located\
  \ more to the north the weather is severe and views are mostly greyish.  Opposite,\
  \ Rocky Mountains are flourishing, sunny and full of tourists. Places are akin to\
  \ a grumpy grandfather and a cheerful grandson. However, there is some powerful\
  \ spirit in the air and ground that makes both formations alike \u2013 the spirit\
  \ of tremendous transformation.  \nAfter hours of rim-walking the eastern edge we\
  \ reached point of a spectacular display of the Never Summer Mountains at its finest.\
  \ Interestingly, snow actually melts out of the Never Summer Mountains. I wondered\
  \ who gave such a daunting name to this beauty and what they tried to conceal. \n\
  The surface of green and gray carpet of grass and mossy stones was neatly decorated\
  \ with pyramids.  The manmade signs you want to keep an eye on to go through the\
  \ area that expands out for miles on end. You feel obliged to put a stone on the\
  \ top of this piece of art, as a gesture of respect to the path and others like\
  \ you.\nI looked after a cloud wondering if it was going to touch the top of the\
  \ hill or this was an altitude illusion, when a visitor appeared. Lonely deer observed\
  \ us and stamped a forefoot on a stone several times. I remembered the Ural fairy-tale\
  \ that had heard when I was a child. It was about a goat with silver hoof. According\
  \ to the legend, it was a big luck to meet this animal due to gems appeared where\
  \ he stepped. Spirit of mountains shapeshifted in animal form. I smiled thinking\
  \ about the fact that I had had to travel half of the world to recognize the resemblance\
  \ of traditional legends from my homeland in another place. May be gems from the\
  \  fairy-tale were an allegory for new brilliant thoughts that mountains kindly\
  \ give you if you are strong-willed to go up there.\nMountains force you to review\
  \ the life, they wind out useless thoughts and show the real size of meaningful\
  \ objects in one\u2019s life. The Continental Divide is especially symbolical based\
  \ on its nature  \u2013 filtering the flow of right thoughts and intentions on the\
  \ one side and the rest on the other. \nThe deer followed us until the final destination\
  \ - a series of black toothy peaks. Obviously, he looked pleased safely guided us\
  \ there and left us after the fulfillment of his mission.\nSatisfied and enlightened\
  \ with traveling \u201Csatori\u201D we turned back. Because you\u2019ll want to\
  \ be below treeline when afternoon storms roll in."
