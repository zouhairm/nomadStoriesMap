Text: "There are many things that travel can teach you, but one thing I\u2019ve really\
  \ learned is to break the first rule you get to know with the upbringing: \u201C\
  Do not talk to strangers\u201D.\n\n\nI have made quite some travels. I love talking\
  \ with people, escaping from the commercial areas and exploring the unknown. I\u2019\
  ve got art history degree, that made me passionate about exploring the abandoned\
  \ and forgotten spaces. Once on a trip I found out in an art history old album ancient\
  \ ruins that it seemed rarely anybody has heard of. \_\n\n\nIt took place in Turkey\
  \ last year. I was lucky to meet a nice girl accidentally, so since she shared my\
  \ enthusiasm, we decided to go there. She was quite a nerd, slavic origins, scientific\
  \ approach to life. Sensitive, open minded and scared of dogs as well. None of us\
  \ had much of a hitch-hike experience, so following the online advices, we started\
  \ with a petrol station. \n\n\nWe made a story, of students making research and\
  \ bla bla bla, we\u2019ve got the ride. The talk was in the mix of languages, but\
  \ we kept on understanding each other. The man was divorced, had a picture of of\
  \ his new born kid. It was clearly a boy, since the main subject of the picture\
  \ was his penis. Not surprising, that\u2019s one of men life objective sometimes.\
  \ He left us on a countryside, where we were not lucky to get a ride after some\
  \ time. \n\n\nTrack driver. \n\nHe was passionate about car racing. Once an accident\
  \ caused a burn of a skin on his back. Proudly he demonstrated. He drove a bit fast\
  \ and furious, wanted to make an impression on my friend Natasza. Eventually we\u2019\
  ve got our destination.\n\n\nThe museum was closed. We spent all the day making\
  \ this travel, so we jumped the fence over, had a nice walk. The sun was setting.\
  \ The ruins were shrouded by a \_mild worm light. \n\n\nFastly it got a deep night,\
  \ time to go back. The frustrations started growing in us, no drivers wanted to\
  \ stop. Suddenly a lady came to us, saying that she parked her turck few miles away,\
  \ and offered a lift. \n\nShe appreciated our company so much, that proposed to\
  \ visit her at home.\n\n\xB4-i will stop to see my children, wanna come over? -\
  \ we were convinced. \n\nI\u2019d love you to try my liquor.\u201D\n\nThree dogs\
  \ run over us. Natasza panicked. Some people call their pets \u201Cchildren\u201C\
  . We understood. To make it weirder, the table was shaped as a wooden dog too. The\
  \ alcohol was very strong. \u201CWhen is the day going to end? If ever?\u2019\u2019\
  \n\n\nWe did. The tracklady left us some cons to buy train tickets to get back home\
  \ even. After a day I found in my bag a cinnamonn cake, favourite of the lady who\
  \ wanted us to try it. \n\n\nNowadays I feel this adventure made me another person.\
  \ I believe people can be helpful, and anyway I\u2019m confident, I will always\
  \ find my way.\n\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe male truck driver tried to engage with my Natasza.\
  \ Not successful, of course."
