Text: "I hear him coming behind me. His feet skiing on the ground like sandpaper.\
  \ I hear the kissing of teacups as they clink each other on the tray while the saucers\
  \ slide back and forth. I am too embarrassed at the thought of being impolite to\
  \ turn around. He brushes past my uncle and I, and begins another round of work.\n\
  \nHe is the tea man. He is charming and invites all those around him to conversation.\
  \ He wears a black beanie gently folded over at the brim, paired with a carefully\
  \ layered ensemble. In true Russian nesting doll fashion, his navy blazer is paired\
  \ over his wool argyle vest, which sits over his off-white button up. His warn dress\
  \ pants wrinkle more and more the nearer they reach the floor. \n\nGreeted with\
  \ a slew of hellos as he walks past each business in the carpet faction of the Tabriz\
  \ bazaar, the tea man offers each merchant a cup of chai. He has created an art\
  \ form out of a minute chore. He balances fifteen to twenty teas that he has poured\
  \ to the rim of hourglass chalices. Sensibly placed on stacked tiers, he carries\
  \ his rounded silver trays by pinching the self-made handle on the top tier.\n\n\
  The men working in this bloc have a distinctive culture. Throughout the day they\
  \ sit outside on stools or lean against the doorway of their shops as they make\
  \ conversation with one another to pass time. My uncle says that many of these men\
  \ will not sell one carpet today. It\u2019s a slow business with few transactions,\
  \ and the isolation makes it difficult for many. One day, a client will walk in\
  \ and a five-figure transaction is completed in a matter of minutes. The rest of\
  \ their hours are spent chatting with one another, and waiting for rounds of chai.\
  \ \n\nThe chai keeps spirits high. It is a necessary cog in the mechanism. The tea\
  \ man\u2019s welcoming presence and appearance every hour gives the merchants something\
  \ to look forward to in an otherwise dismal business.  \n \nWe sit in various shops\
  \ and meet the men my uncle has brought me to see. Successful and confident businessmen\
  \ roll out their silk carpets like diplomas. \n\nSince the Safavid rule in ancient\
  \ Persia, Persian carpets are seen as luxurious approaches to intricately expressing\
  \ a person\u2019s wealth or rich travels. During Safavid rule, Tabriz received international\
  \ prominence as a carpet hub for locals and global art collectors alike. Today,\
  \ the 1,000-year-old bazaar that once welcomed traders on the Silk Road continues\
  \ to be the beating heart of hand woven carpets.\n\nI\u2019m speaking of undeniably\
  \ beautiful, handcrafted pieces. The carpets each told their own story. Their colors\
  \ were intentionally chosen. Their patterns were passed down from generation to\
  \ generation within kin. These are the very carpets hand selected to decorate the\
  \ walls of museums and elegant living rooms throughout the world. \n\nI hear the\
  \ clinking again. \n\nHe\u2019s arrived with tea for the merchants. Smiles slowly\
  \ domino across their faces one by one. Their renewed energy is sure to last the\
  \ next hour, and their spirits are noticeably lifted. In a bazaar filled with the\
  \ world\u2019s most luxurious carpets, the tea man holds the most priceless chandelier\
  \ in the world."
