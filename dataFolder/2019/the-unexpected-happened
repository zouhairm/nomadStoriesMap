Text: "In August 2018 I had been booked for a three day financial markets course in\
  \ Cape Town. The course commenced from the 19-21 of August. On the last day of the\
  \ course, while still at the course venue - I received an sms from the Airbnb owner\
  \ asking if I'm may be interested in a city tour that he organised for all his BnB\
  \ guests for that weekend. Without any hesitation I responded with a big YES. It\
  \ was an exciting request because I didn't really know Cape Town that much - so\
  \ it was an opportunity not to be missed. Little did I know that he was also a certified\
  \ tourist guide with proven track record.\n\nThe total price for the tour was very\
  \ reasonable. Also, we (the guests) were offered a free night stay for the 22nd\
  \ - the day of the tour - which was a cherry on top! So, the journey began in the\
  \ morning, 22 August - where we started off by the cbd to explore historical buildings\
  \ and monuments . We then proceeded to the famous Camps bay, a very beautiful surbab\
  \ with an amazing architectural designs and beautiful beaches. I took quite a lot\
  \ of pictures, and of cause videos just to make that experience memorable.\n\nWe\
  \ then proceed to Hout bay, a very beautiful town - where we took on a boat cruise.\
  \ As much as it was my first time boarding a boat, the experience was impeccable.\
  \ I had finally overcomed my fears of going through ocean deep. I felt like I've\
  \ been trapped some where secluded for a very long time cause after the trip I realised\
  \ that I haven't lived my life to the utmost best.  \n\nWe took a long drive along\
  \ the Atlantic ocean and passed beautiful towns and beaches and finally reached\
  \ the Cape Point where we went through the assembly point and proceeded to the higher\
  \ end of the place. When you're at the top of Cape Point you can easily see where\
  \ the Indian and Atlantic oceans meet, and the water is very different - with the\
  \ Atlantic having the blue water, Indian ocean having the darkish blue water. Also,\
  \ at the top, you can see from far where Cape Town cbd is at.\n\nWe then proceed\
  \ along the Indian ocean through Simon's town. Another beautiful town with a rich\
  \ history. We saw penguins and learned a lot about how they preserve the penguins.\
  \ The time was about 15pm in the afternoon and we stopped by at some sea food restaurant\
  \ to fill up our tummies as we were very hungry. I had the most nutritious meals\
  \ ever. The restaurant serves food that comes directly from the sea straight to\
  \ their outlet - so no middle man in the whole process. I also learned about the\
  \ history of the restaurant's owner. He started the business together with his brother\
  \ who had unfortunately passed on, (may his soul continue rest in eternal peace).\
  \ It was at that moment when I realised that I owe it to myself to come back again\
  \ to the restaurant whenever I'm in Cape Town. \n\nOn our way to Muizenburg, we\
  \ stopped by along the road and took photos and proceeded with the journey. I was\
  \ enjoying the trip so much that I had forgotten to call at home and tell them I\
  \ would be coming back on the 23rd. The weather started getting a little cold and\
  \ everyone seemed to be a lil disappointed cause we still had to go get a few beers\
  \ at the shimmy beach club. That didn't stop us though because we wanted to have\
  \ fun and make great memories that'll be cherished by our children and great grand\
  \ children in the near future.\n\nAt the end of trip I was filled with so much enthusiasm\
  \ and couldn't wait to tell my friends and family about my experience. I honestly\
  \ never expected so much fun for that weekend. I urge to everyone that's visiting\
  \ Cape Town soon to partake on such trips and explore the town in the most exciting\
  \ and enjoyable way. I really didn't expect to find the beauty that is Cape Town\
  \ so intriguing like the way it was when I was exploring."
