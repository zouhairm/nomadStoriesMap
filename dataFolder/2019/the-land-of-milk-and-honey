Text: "Springbok is renowned for the transformation when the barren scrubland explodes\
  \ into flowers. This time of year, the flowers in my grandmother\u2019s yard stand\
  \ proud as soldiers. Many tourists take pictures there. She refused, ashamed of\
  \ the chipped paint, the rusted window frames. But it adds to the \u201Cauthenticity\u201D\
  \ of their photograph. During my visits I often felt alien rather than inhabitant.\
  \ At first this was because of school and later because I realized I hate winter\
  \ rains. If I\u2019m going to a semi-dessert, I want it hot, dry and dusty. \nI\u2019\
  ve chosen to attribute my hydrophobia to the Nama\u2019s abstinence from water during\
  \ sacred phases. After a woman gives birth, she\u2019s kept in a hut for seven days,\
  \ isn\u2019t allowed to wash herself or baby and is to avoid human touch as far\
  \ possible. To minimise the child\u2019s risk of catching track. Evil spirits walk\
  \ about at night and anyone who walked on their track spreads it. Since we no longer\
  \ live in huts, we stay home for ten-days after the birth. This, I\u2019m preparing\
  \ to tell the nurses at my next pre-natal visit. A bedvrou is not allowed to leave\
  \ the house. \nBefore someone passes, they are kept from touch and water until the\
  \ very end. Water is for drinking and cleansing.\nOur parents breastfed us memories\
  \ of the Land of Milk and Honey-where the people are as brown and seemingly lifeless\
  \ as the scenery. But, if you know where to look, it hosts an unimaginable magnitude\
  \ of life and death\nThis journey would be different from all other trips made to\
  \ the Promised Land. I was six-months pregnant and didn\u2019t know if I would survive\
  \ an eight-hour drive in the back of a bakkie. But most importantly, here was the\
  \ purpose of the journey-my grandmother\u2019s funeral. For me, life and death were\
  \ jumping in front of me like the renowned kudus on this very road. \nWhen we arrived,\
  \ the entire place smelled like damp soil. Like those scents you cannot describe.\
  \ Those you don\u2019t think about until you smell them again. Those that indescribably\
  \ smell like home. \nWe drove around in the dorp. The houses with trimmed green\
  \ lawns had signs, \u201CBeware of the dog\u201D. I\u2019m reminded of one time\
  \ my aunt and I walked through Xhoeroe passageway, a thin dusty footpath that snakes\
  \ through rocky hills. The easiest way to walk from the coloured location to town.\
  \ I must have been twelve and my relaxed-and-straightened hair threatened to show\
  \ its true colours. When we made it all the way up and down again, we stopped for\
  \ a moment under the shade of a tree. A white lady came out yelling \u201CThis is\
  \ private property! Gaan weg!\u201D\n In Bergsig, the coloured community which makes\
  \ up 79% of the town\u2019s population, there are few tar roads. Most Nama people\
  \ who have been labelled as \u2018coloured\u2019 during Apartheid-census, live in\
  \ four-room matchboxes with outside toilets.  Now, new shops have popped up on every\
  \ corner. I bought a loaf of bread at the tuckshop and the owner, Bafana, slid three\
  \ R200 notes underneath for, \u201Cone night\u201D. \nDuring apartheid, the natives\
  \ could be promoted from \u201Cblack\u201D to \u201Ccoloured\u2019. A light-skinned\
  \ coloured could straighten/chemically treat their hair to be promoted to white.\
  \ The goal was always white and we inherited this. When I stopped straightening\
  \ my hair, my grandmother cried, ashamed to walk with me.\nMy father\u2019s words\
  \ dried up in my last trimester. Disappointed beyond console, which, as I saw him\
  \ the morning of the service at his childhood home crying, I wish I could. My proud\
  \ father, a real soldier, crying. My uncle knotted my father\u2019s tie and put\
  \ it around his neck. Striking, because my father always does them himself, having\
  \ been in the army or as he says, the real army. I wondered if it was his way of\
  \ severing the tie. \nOn our way back, we stopped in Pofadder. My father climbed\
  \ out, came back with dried fruit and a springbok with buttons for eyes. He passed\
  \ it to me through the small window saying nothing. Sometimes forgiveness doesn\u2019\
  t need announcing. It rained before we got to Upington and I knew, we went to be\
  \ baptized."
