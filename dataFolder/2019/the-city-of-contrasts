Text: "Coming from a very religious country while not being a very religious person\
  \ myself I have always found interest in the relations that religion holds onto\
  \ social and personal development in cultures. That\u2019s why I wanted to explore\
  \ Asia, a continent with so many different belief systems; rituals and representation\
  \ of spirituality often compacted in our own erroneous western visions. \n\nIn 2018\
  \ I had the opportunity to travel to Thailand and found the most amazing cities\
  \ of contrasts. I have never thought that Bangkok would be this modern, busy and\
  \ traditional city all at once. You could be walking through boutiques and huge\
  \ malls just to turn around the corner and encounter with a Buddhist temple covered\
  \ in golden statues and people from all ethnicities kneeled in front of religious\
  \ images in total silence, completely unaware of the busy life that is going on\
  \ outside, of the rivers of tourists like myself taking pictures to what we find\
  \ beautiful and they find sacred.\n\nI come with a big group, so we rush into the\
  \ bustle of the city. The smell of recently baked bread comes out of a coffee shop,\
  \ crossing the streets full of cars and tuk-tuks which are the most popular ways\
  \ of transportation, small motorbikes that fit three people comfortably but are\
  \ often packed with four or more tourists. Walking among barefoot monks we arrive\
  \ at a street covered in peddlers offering noodles with seafood cooked in the moment,\
  \ traditional clothes and endless amounts of different souvenirs from ashtrays to\
  \ t-shirts, improvised shelves on top of motorcycles offering lighters and key chains.\
  \ A woman serving a warm beverage while she holds a cat on her shoulder, children\
  \ playing around the shore of the dock watching us with curiosity and hiding behind\
  \ their parents lap as our 34 people group tries to pass through all this movement\
  \ compacted into a small alley. \n\nThe boat takes us on a 20-minutes ride across\
  \ the grey landscape that the river offers. Infinity of small-improvised houses\
  \ and establishments made of blades and wood are built at the shore of the river\
  \ and bellow the bridges and docks, you can see the clothes of the people living\
  \ there laid over the windows. Since it\u2019s really early, there\u2019s only our\
  \ group in the waterbus and kids with school uniforms. We arrive to another spectral\
  \ point of interest, the Wat Arun temple. It is still early for the hordes of tourists\
  \ to arrive, so we have the whole place for ourselves.\n\nI come close to the entrance\
  \ of the temple where there are 2 big trays holding incense and candles. Some are\
  \ recently lit, but most of them have been here for quite some time, there are also\
  \ lotus flowers at the feet of the trays, as I will later found out this are offerings\
  \ to Buddha. We wander around the Wat Arun temple for an hour. Climbing the stairs\
  \ everything being blue, golden and white and not one centimeter of the temple isn\u2019\
  t covered in decorations, statues or paintings. \n\nAt the end we have some free\
  \ time to see the surroundings of the place. Outside the temple and close to the\
  \ souvenirs vendors there is an exhibition where volunteers explain the teachings\
  \ of Buddha, how they see him as a master and not as a god and most importantly\
  \ explaining to tourists like many others and me visiting this place the ultimate\
  \ sacred meaning behind the image of Buddha and the way to show respect to the religion,\
  \ the believer and the image itself. \n\nI have so many questions; and ask as much\
  \ as I can to the people at this exhibition who are also helping me translate a\
  \ conversation I\u2019m having with one of the monks. Happy to explain me his beliefs\
  \ and convictions, explaining me his point of view in life, religion, death and\
  \ pain. And for those 20 minutes before I had to rush back with my group, sitting\
  \ there at a bench overseeing the Chao Phraya River, poorly translating my conversation\
  \ with a monk I obtained the answers that this city of contrasts has hidden."
