Text: "Taking a sip of coffee. Ah! Feels so good. Looking ahead at the marvellous\
  \ nature, covered in blankets of snow were the Himalayas. Huge trees dancing in\
  \ joy, dew drops falling of leaves, the sun trying to peek through those rebellious\
  \ cloud! Cold air refreshing all the tiredness and making us feel so calm spreading\
  \ huge smiles everywhere.\nThis was a trip to trek Kedarnath mountain residing in\
  \ Himalays through Uttarakhand.\nAll the bags packed moving towards the Railway\
  \ Station looking at the people gathered around for the trip I was mesmerized. They\
  \ were around 50's varying drastically in age, that's how Indians usually travel\
  \ i.e with family groups.  \nI was in grade 9 and loved to travel, after 3 days\
  \ of continuous travelling from train following by a bus we finally reached the\
  \ mountain ridge and it just felt worth bearing those intolerable train days. \n\
  We reached our destination by noon time and decided to start the journey for meeting\
  \ the apex early morning. Randomly shopping and marking all the essentials the atmosphere\
  \ became quite breezy. Strong wind blowing small shops away all of a sudden it starts\
  \ raining. The rains were quite mild at first, gradually it started pouring heavily.\
  \ Within few hours the world seemed like half immersed in water. Pedestrians hiking\
  \ down informed everyone it was heavily snowing and chances are the path would be\
  \ closed soon. \nThere were no rooms available so everyone decided to take a stay\
  \ in a big hallroom, no electricity supply dining within the candle lights we were\
  \ lost in the moment enjoying ourselves at the fullest and went asleep not worrying\
  \ about the outside nature drama. \nWe woke up to the morning where everything seemed\
  \ just right on place. We completed our hike with all smiles having fun around experiencing\
  \ all the new things! \nSheeps and peopled just seemed like ants within so much\
  \ of fog we all were invisible to each other even at some distance. \nThe experience\
  \ was great!!"
