Text: "Roatan was a place I had never traveled to and it was a destination that piqued\
  \ my curiosity so I encouraged my husband to go as he's not as adventurous as I\
  \ am and we went!  Life back home in the States seemed ok but it was time for a\
  \ little excursion outside the home and our daily grind.  Let us see it started\
  \ on a cruise the Royal Carribean which gave us the freedom to take advantage of\
  \ the sights and seeing into this beautiful destination.  Honduras in my mind I\
  \ knew was not like Paris, FR Cozumel, Mexico or even Savannah Georgia here in the\
  \ United States.  No, it was more alive with bustling streets filled with locals\
  \ zooming fast in their motorbikes, sometimes without helmets! Never the less, on\
  \ our bus tour we enjoyed a day of sights with our wonderful bus guide Antonio and\
  \ his partner in crime Shirley - not to mistaken by another other Shirley in town\
  \ as per Shirley herself.  It began with the visit to the lizard farm sanctuary\
  \ that housed not one but families of iguana lizards of all shapes and sizes.  While\
  \ they weren't the only domesticated animals there a few beautiful peacocks that\
  \ neighbored these curious lizards.  Down by the dock - a young man feeds hungry\
  \ local fishes.  You were encouraged to feed them for a tip which we did with our\
  \ hands into the bay.  Next was then a visit to missionary church which was now\
  \ converted into the mini Epcot center for clay headstones reminiscing the ancient\
  \ world of the Mayan culture.  Life was good but it didn't end there - no while\
  \ being bused through the tight narrow streets of the West Shore Bay we were dropped\
  \ off to a local barista that allowed tourists to witness the making of their local\
  \ cocoa being made into sweet chocolate concoctions and coffee delights.  We were\
  \ in heaven, to say the least.  Walking through this dirt road many children were\
  \ out selling their homemade beaded bracelets, keepsake charms and for the price,\
  \ I happily agreed to take home my beautiful and macaw hanging charm.  Continuing\
  \ our bus tour my husband and I waiting anxiously for what was next.  Yes, finally\
  \ some ancient ruins! While it was low key and not overly \"touristy\" our final\
  \ bus tour destination lead us to Costa Maya to Chacchoben ruins.  This colossal\
  \ of pyramids of sacred temples could only be experienced by the experience itself\
  \ and that is truly being there.  As you traveled through the jungle of this monumental\
  \ moment the presence of the ancients could be felt like no other.  Several other\
  \ tourists, including Miguel our tourist guide, promised us they would surely see\
  \ us through without any causalities so we sighed in relief.  One never knows when\
  \ you're traveling to a destination unknown like Roatan Honduras - a place of wonder,\
  \ sights and funny looking lizards that in some way remind you of a sister or brother.\
  \  \n\nWelcome to the West Shores of Roatan and Costa Maya where life awaits and\
  \ there is no turning or running back!  \n\nWritten by XDL - aka KM- KittyMeow.\
  \  Hope you enjoyed it...Till next flight"
