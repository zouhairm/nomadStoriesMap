Text: "In my eyes, \u201Cmaking it\u201D has always required success on a big scale.\
  \ That\u2019s why I applied to a college on the east coast that promised opportunity\
  \ and excitement and was over a thousand miles away from my Midwest roots. So, when\
  \ one of my best friends took the opposite path after high school graduation, I\
  \ was baffled. Josh moved from the capital of Nebraska to a town on the other side\
  \ of the state with 15,000 people and about as many cows. He sought freedom and\
  \ solitude, so he baled hay, herded animals, and lived in the basement of his grandparents\u2019\
  \ farmhouse. \n\nA few months after he moved, I played my last game of softball\
  \ before college. My family\u2019s options after the tournament in Colorado were\
  \ to drive eight hours home through a summer storm or stay in Denver and wallow\
  \ in defeat. I proposed we go north and stay with Josh in Scottsbluff. To my surprise,\
  \ my parents agreed. \n\nDuring the drive, I observed the prairie. I realized that\
  \ there was something beautiful about the lack of trees because I could see the\
  \ whole sky that way\u2014horizon to horizon. It was not only above me, but beside\
  \ me. The color blue engulfed our car as its speakers blared, \u201CBye, bye Miss\
  \ American Pie\u2026\u201D \n\nThe nothingness made the world seem smaller. I could\
  \ not wonder what hid behind buildings or mountains. There was only the sureness\
  \ of flat land and the sky. The impending change in my life weighed heavily on my\
  \ shoulders, so I bathed in the security of the empty land. \n\nThe tires of our\
  \ car crunched the gravel all the way up to the little white farmhouse. We parked\
  \ between a tractor and pickup with a cherry picker on the back.\n\nAs I approached\
  \ the porch, two old men emerged from inside the house. I wasn\u2019t sure which\
  \ one was his grandfather, so I smiled patiently. The one with a baseball cap and\
  \ a belt buckle welcomed me up the stairs while the other walked to the truck. \n\
  \u201CJohn here fixed our power lines just in time for your stay!\u201D \n\u201C\
  Your power was out?\u201D my dad asked. \n\u201CI thought Josh told Amelia,\u201D\
  \ now-confirmed Grandpa replied.\n\u201CI didn\u2019t tell my parents because then\
  \ we wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201D\nMy mom sneered because she knew I was right,\
  \ and my dad laughed because he would\u2019ve done the same thing. \n\nJosh and\
  \ I headed out to visit the namesake of the town, the bluff. It jutted out from\
  \ behind houses and farms. It\u2019s essentially a glorified sandcastle with the\
  \ evidence of thousands of years of formation stacked in shades of light brown rock.\
  \ Like a sandcastle, the bluff is fragile. But instead of waves washing the masterpiece\
  \ away, the winds that rip across the Great Plains and the footsteps of travelers\
  \ wear down the bluff inch by inch.\n\nFrom the top of the bluff, the sky stretched\
  \ from nothingness in Nebraska in the east to the mountain of Laramie, Wyoming in\
  \ the west. Past my feet, I examined the entirety of Scottsbluff. There were little\
  \ houses, and a couple of schools, and a church.\n\nScottsbluff is not glamorous.\
  \ Nor are a lot of Nebraskan towns. But places don\u2019t have to be pretty to be\
  \ beautiful. When I look at city skylines I am filled with wonder because they hold\
  \ bustling crowds where anything could be happening. When I looked out over a small\
  \ town on a Sunday, I was filled with comfort because I didn\u2019t have to guess.\
  \ There were people like me putting one foot in front of the other. \n\nThe idea\
  \ that \u201Cmaking it\u201D demanded a big stage and bright lights discredited\
  \ Josh\u2019s success, which is on no stage at all, but rather alone in a field.\
  \ The beauty of what he does, and what Nebraska is, is that what you see is what\
  \ you get. It may be mundane, but there is no denying that it is authentic. And\
  \ with the unfamiliarity of getting older in a new place approaching on my horizon,\
  \ it felt good to know that I had something that I could count on."
