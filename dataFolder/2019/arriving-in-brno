Text: "\u201CWhy Brno?\u201D people asked me when I told them about my study abroad\
  \ plans.\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D\n\u201CHave you visited the Czech Republic before?\u201D\
  . I hadn\u2019t. I soon would though, I thought, looking at the details of my one-way\
  \ flight.\n\nMy arrival in Brno was at the tiniest airport I\u2019d seen - the baggage\
  \ carousel wasn\u2019t even moving when I went to retrieve my suitcase. I waved\
  \ cautiously at a girl who looked like the \u2018buddy\u2019 I\u2019d been assigned,\
  \ Ketrin. She was smiley and she helped me haul my stuff into the car, whilst quiet\
  \ anxiety settled in my stomach. It was 10:30 pm so I didn\u2019t see much of Czechia\
  \ as we drove through the darkness on the way to my dormitory. Ketrin told me all\
  \ about her 2018 adventures studying abroad in Britain. I\u2019m not prone to homesickness,\
  \ but hearing her talk about England so fondly made me start to miss home already.\n\
  \nIt was only a short journey and when we got there we yanked my stuff out the car,\
  \ walking over to a cold, brick building only to be met with exasperation from a\
  \ tired receptionist.\n\u201CYou\u2019re in the wrong place\u201D she shooed us\
  \ away with an unpleasant tone.\n\u201CThey\u2019re often like that\u201D. Ketrin\
  \ laughed, unphased. I smiled but it made me even more nervous.\n\u201CDo you speak\
  \ English?\u201D I asked the next receptionist, when we\u2019d moved to the correct\
  \ location. He gave out a heavy sigh and rolled his eyes dramatically. He shook\
  \ his head and directed everything he had to say at Ketrin. As she translated, the\
  \ receptionist stared at me, eyebrows raised disapprovingly. The look told me I\
  \ was a nuisance and I could physically feel the shame that leaked out of my British\
  \ passport. \u201CI voted remain!\u201D the voice in my head screamed, wondering\
  \ if my accent was synonymous with the embarrassment of Brexit. As he gestured for\
  \ me to go away, I felt very alone.\n\nThere were a mere few lights visible when\
  \ looking out the windows of my room in nighttime Moravia. Inside, everything was\
  \ white and cream and beige. As Ketrin left me I too could have asked \u201Cwhy\
  \ Brno?\u201D, but I didn\u2019t need to ask. After some sleep, the semester to\
  \ come would show me why I was here.\n\nThe next few days consisted of exploring\
  \ the city, meeting new people and learning that the Czechs really do take their\
  \ beer seriously (I had some adjusting to do, I thought, sipping on my white wine).\
  \ The city was relaxed but full of life; everything was new and I was in awe that\
  \ over these next few months, it would all become familiar.\n\nI had a couple of\
  \ questions about how things worked in the dormitory.\n\u201CJust ask the receptionist\u201D\
  \ Anna said when I brought it up. I looked over at those disapproving eyes and approached\
  \ the desk reluctantly. His bothered gaze made me anxious.\n\u201CCan I help you?\u2019\
  \ he asked in perfect English. I blinked and responded hurriedly. He smirked like\
  \ he was amused and answered my questions kindly. I thanked him, pleased. Aside\
  \ from having explanations, I was just happy that he didn\u2019t seem to hate me.\n\
  \nNow, when I say \u2018Ahoy\u2019 as I walk through the door and see him, he dares\
  \ to share a half-smile and, greeting me with \u2018Hello\u2019. I think about how\
  \ he refused to say a word of English upon our first meeting. Just because someone\
  \ can speak English, doesn\u2019t mean they necessarily want to. And why should\
  \ they? Let the British student who\u2019s arrived in the Czech Republic be failed\
  \ by her reliance on the dominance of her native language - let her feel shame over\
  \ being monolingual in a country that isn't her own.\n\nAmongst the adventure, friendship,\
  \ mind-blowingly great public transport and beer cheaper than water, I have found\
  \ home in consistency. I\u2019ve found it in the walk I make to and from the bus\
  \ stop daily; the quietness after 10pm; and of course, the polite exchanges with\
  \ locals I manage to get half-smiles out of. They show me why I\u2019m here: to\
  \ explore, and to learn more and more definitions of \u2018home\u2019, in what was\
  \ once just the unknown."
