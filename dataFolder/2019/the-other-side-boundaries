Text: "In today\u2019s time Traveling is a much fateful for everyone. It is a part\
  \ and parcel of everyone. It considered as a constitutive for the youngsters to\
  \ know about the other countries and come knowing about their cultures, their livings\
  \ as well. Every person wants to travel in their lives and it\u2019s a dream of\
  \ every youth as well, I am also in of them. We know that travelling abroad is vastly\
  \ expensive for middle class family as I am one of them. In my point of view, what\
  \ real travelling is? and how it feels from the depth of the heart. Without travelling\
  \ we don\u2019t come to know about this new era and the real world.\nFirst and Foremost,\
  \ travelling is a life, it\u2019s an addiction, and it\u2019s a love. We can\u2019\
  t feel it if we don\u2019t know the real adventure of life. Travelling from one\
  \ place to another without knowing anything that what is coming next. The imaginations,\
  \ feeling, goose bumps in whole body tackle. However, stimulation to know about\
  \ the culture of the place, pupil livings and their welfare society. \nMoreover,\
  \ in 2018 I went to Indonesia for Asian Games as a volunteer which was a sponsored\
  \ trip. It was mine first abroad trip. I was so astir and comfy. That was an inexplicable\
  \ trip for me. I lived there on my own for at least one month and got a chance to\
  \ make a local connections and know about their community. During game work I met\
  \ so many local folk and the understanding between us was like we were friends from\
  \ so many years. It\u2019s all about the great sightedness and the feelings regarding\
  \ each other, even we didn\u2019t come from same background. I met their friends\
  \ to friends and procured a juncture to know about their summation. I used to promenade\
  \ in public transports which helped me to know about the local life. Every day I\
  \ woke up with a thinking of new daring, some new to do and new excitement. I converge\
  \ with so many different demos there which helped me to know about the mindset of\
  \ the native who live there, the language there is different, but I learned that\
  \ even if you don\u2019t speak the language, try to make a conversation, it\u2019\
  s also a one part of your travelling, discussions gave me a new understanding. Dine\
  \ with them was also a one of the apart exposure of the trip and trust me it was\
  \ an unspeakable feeling. Over and above, I moved at so many ancient places and\
  \ in cultural events which helped me to be aware about their veterans.\nIn the last\
  \ when it was a time for me to come back to my country, everyone was so sad, some\
  \ cried too and I was also nostalgic. The time I realized that from wherever you\
  \ come from, only boundaries make you apart but people desire you with their heart.\
  \ Travelling helps you to change your mindset and fill positiveness in you. It is\
  \ one of the extreme conspicuous feeling ever. It gives us a lesson that we are\
  \ one, so many things are common in between us. Just feel it and live it. I learned\
  \ that widen your world by starting small. Be limitless."
