Text: "\"Brussels is too cold in January. I\u2019d love to come back in the spring.\"\
  \n\nI kept repeating this to myself as I wandered around Old Town, fidgeting with\
  \ my faux leather jacket.\n\nMy calves ached from my boots. The slight incline of\
  \ the streets caused them to compress and dig into my legs. My socks were already\
  \ soaked from the water that crept into the seams and worn spots. \n\nThis was the\
  \ first winter I didn\u2019t have a proper winter coat. I could have asked for one\
  \ for my birthday.  But instead I asked my parents for money to buy a plane ticket\
  \ to Brussels so I could join my husband on a \u201Cbusiness trip.\u201D \n\nI was\
  \ the wife of a broke PhD student. I shivered on the cobblestones thinking about\
  \ all the things we would do in Europe the next time we had money.\n\nWhile he was\
  \ at the university during the day, I created little adventures for myself. That\
  \ day\u2019s adventure lead me to a clean and organized vintage clothing store.\
  \ \n\nI wanted to take home a souvenir; something to add to the adventure I was\
  \ writing in my head. \n\nI knew what I needed: A winter coat!\n\nThe coat that\
  \ whispered to me was olive green and wool, trimmed with reddish suede.  Jewel toned\
  \ colored squares lined the bottom of the hem. And big brass buttons with lions\
  \ on them lined the front. It was \u20AC 20.\n\nI was cold. I wanted to put it on\
  \ immediately. But my mother\u2019s words echoed in my mind. \"You really should\
  \ wash it first.\"\n \n\u201CAre these pre-washed?\u201D I asked the cashier. \n\
  \n\u201CNo,\u201D he said. \u201CWe recommend you wash them to get rid of any dirt\
  \ or parasites.\u201D\n\nParasites?\n\n\u201COk, fine, thank you.\u201D  I paid\
  \ and went on my way, carrying my coat in a flimsy plastic bag.\n\nI looked at the\
  \ time. I still had a few hours before I needed to meet my husband. \n\nDid I have\
  \ time to get the coat dry cleaned? No, probably not. And besides, I had no idea\
  \ how much the service cost in Brussels. \nI was determined to wear it. I walked\
  \ a little further and then I saw my solution.\n\nA laundromat!\n\nYes, I could\
  \ go to the laundromat and wash it on a delicate cycle. Then dry it slightly and\
  \ hang it to dry in the hotel room. \n\nBrilliant!\n\nMy coat was soon settled into\
  \ its wash cycle. I watched and waited. \n\nA man struck up a conversation with\
  \ me. He complemented my blue eyes and American name. Malek was his name. He was\
  \ happy to practice his English. \n\nWe talked about America. I told him about how\
  \ I moved to Switzerland with my husband for his job.\n\nA thumping sound interrupted\
  \ our conversation. I checked my machine.  My coat was saturated. The drum was off\
  \ balance. The machine stopped and an error message flashed across the screen.\n\
  \n\u201CShould I tell someone?\u201D I asked Malek. \n\nThere was no attendant present.\n\
  \n\u201CNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201D he shrugged. \n\nI opened the machine door and\
  \ took out the sopping coat. There was a pool of water still in the bottom of the\
  \ machine.\n\nI thought that if I dried the coat in the dryer for a short time it\u2019\
  d relieve some of the excess water. But eight minutes wasn\u2019t enough. \n\nMalek\
  \ shook his head and took the coat outside. I watched him twist the water out onto\
  \ the already wet cobblestones. I thanked him for his help and shoved the coat back\
  \ into the plastic bag. I\u2019d just go back to the hotel. Malek wished me well\
  \ \n\nI rode the subway oblivious to the fact my coat was still dripping. A lady\
  \ tapped me on the shoulder and said something in French. \nShe took a plastic bag\
  \ out of her purse and offered it to me.\n\nEmbarrassed, I took it and thanked her.\n\
  \nI walked through the hotel lobby with a trail still dripping behind me.  I hung\
  \ the coat from the shower curtain bar in the bathroom and watched it drip on the\
  \ floor; little pink drops from the dye that ran from the red suede trim.\n\nAdventure\
  \ completed. I\u2019d be warm tomorrow."
