Text: "After all the time looking for this exchange program I was only looking for\
  \ a right place to learn proper English and study. \nA twenty years old girl in\
  \ Canada that was expecting everything, but not falling in love. Falling in love\
  \ with him is easy, and get used to him even more. I was not expecting to find someone\
  \ that could actually make me feel like changing all my plans. I think that\u2019\
  s what happens with the trips. My mom says that if we want to make everything more\
  \ interesting we don\u2019t need to plan, just go ahead with a little idea of what\
  \ we cannot miss in the trip but then just go for it, like if we were guide by the\
  \ wind and changing places everywhere all the time. The same happen with me, in\
  \ this journey of school I let myself guide by the wind and believe me, I\u2019\
  m enjoying the ride.\nWhen we travel we don\u2019t spect anything besides memories\
  \ that last forever and that\u2019s what is going to happen to me, meeting people\
  \ from all around the world and learning different cultures and languages it\u2019\
  s something that we cannot change for anything. The feelings of experiencing things\
  \ that we were not planning it\u2019s the most satisfactory feeling. Happiness,\
  \ intrigue, adrenaline; just let yourself guide by this spontaneous wind and I swear\
  \ that you will never regret. \nThis love story guide me to one Austrian boy who\
  \ was here also for an exchange, there was no way that we can coincide in this journey\
  \ before what happen, and let me tell you that finding out that there were only\
  \ 3 months left was the saddest thing but also the most amazing one. Every break\
  \ we have we decide to go and travel together, bringing to all this journey new\
  \ experiences together for both of us, eating food from places that are not our\
  \ regular dishes and discovering the culture bring us more together. \nCanada has\
  \ bring me a little dumbo to my life, someone that can be discussing about next\
  \ place to go and experience together or just someone to jump to the next adventure.\
  \ You just be wondering why little dumbo, and well, it\u2019s actually a quite funny\
  \ story. When this little dumbo was a kid, he once had a haircut in which the mix\
  \ of the hairstyle and the big ears that were not proportional to the head make\
  \ him look like elephant ears, since that haircut his family always call here dumbo,\
  \ nowadays the ears look quite proportional so it\u2019s not a dumbo anymore but\
  \ for me since I saw that picture, it is.\nNow one month left and we still thinking\
  \ in that last trip to banff and the delicious food we have there, how the snow\
  \ \xC1ngels in the snow are going to be hard to make in Mexico and austria, how\
  \ the salsas and the milanesas are going to remind us all the experiences in this\
  \ trip. How the difference in language between everybody just bring us together\
  \ and also how a trip can just change your life forever, because I\u2019m sure that\
  \ going back to Mexico will never be the same if all the things I\u2019m doing here\
  \ will have a different meaning and will feel different just because I\u2019m not\
  \ going to be with the same people.\nZulema Romero Ruiz"
