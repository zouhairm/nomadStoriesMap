Text: "Travel is usually associated with feelings of excitement, optimism, enthusiasm\
  \ and anticipation but for me travel came with two big apprehensions; affordability\
  \ and social anxiety, two areas rarely talked about when discussing travel.\n\n\
  I grew up as an only child in a single parent household and naturally for this reason\
  \ I was extremely timid and shy. Even with relatives my words were limited and interactions\
  \ minimal. Hard work from a young age was essential in being able to afford the\
  \ basics and then some. \n\nFor these reasons travel always felt like the impossible\
  \ dream, one that I didn\u2019t put much thought towards until 2015 at the age of\
  \ 22. For me just booking my first overseas trip was petrifying. In the end I booked\
  \ a solo 18-day Contiki Tour of Europe with extra days before and after. \n\nFor\
  \ me, it wasn't just a leap into the unknown, it felt like I was diving head first\
  \ into a parallel universe that was so completely opposite from myself and the safe\
  \ little world I had come to know.\nIn the time between booking my trip and the\
  \ trip itself, fear and doubt were reoccurring feelings that were loud and on repeat.\
  \ \n\nThere is one clear moment, just a few weeks out from my trip, were I sat reading\
  \ the terms and conditions related to cancellation and I remember my Mother saying\
  \ 'If you no longer feel like it's something you want to do or can do, it\u2019\
  s not worth doing. There's no shame'. Although looking back they were very true\
  \ words, at the time these words sent my panic attack spiralling out of control.\
  \ \n\nSomehow though, I managed to make it onto my flight on the 14th October 2015.\
  \ I remember sitting for the entire duration just thinking \u2018You\u2019ve only\
  \ ever been on two holidays. They were both not that long ago, one with your Mum\
  \ and one with friends. They were only half hour plane trips and now your venturing\
  \ half way around the world, on your first overseas trip, solo, what on earth are\
  \ you thinking?\u2019. \n\nWhen I arrived over in Europe and I began meeting people\
  \ both on my tour and on similar ones, I would instinctively greet everyone by saying\
  \ \u2018I\u2019m here by myself. I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m doing this, it is\
  \ completely out of character for me\u2019. It took me a good few days before I\
  \ started embracing the beauty of travel and something within me started to change\
  \ very rapidly. \n\nI soon began exuberating confidence and outgoingness.  I started\
  \ to allow myself to be open to new people and new experiences. While there\u2019\
  s many moments I could write about to provide a mental image of this change, I think\
  \ it\u2019s a post I put on Facebook on the very last day of my tour that sums this\
  \ change up perfectly; \n\n\u2018Eighteen days I completely stepped out of my comfort\
  \ zone and ventured half way across the world, on my first overseas holiday, all\
  \ on my lonesome. Since then I have been to places that I never thought I would\
  \ have the opportunity to go to, do things I didn\u2019t think were even possible\
  \ and meet people that now mean the absolute world to me. I\u2019ve ticked off a\
  \ lot of bucket list must do\u2019s and learnt about the world in a way that can\u2019\
  t be taught in the classroom. My trip may be short, but I feel refreshed and grateful\u2019\
  .\n\n As clich\xE9 as it sounds travel has truly changed me and I owe everything\
  \ I am now to it. Travel allowed me to strip myself of all my vices, to stop the\
  \ doubts and the mental barriers that had held me back in all aspects of life for\
  \ so long. \n\nThrough travel I was able to truly discover myself, my capabilities\
  \ and become a person who is very much willing and wanting to throw themselves into\
  \ this expansive and beautiful world. Now I live by the words of Miram Beard and\
  \ hope that everyone can personally discover that \u2018Travel is more than the\
  \ seeing of sights; it is a change that goes on, deep and permanent, in the ideas\
  \ of living\u2019."
