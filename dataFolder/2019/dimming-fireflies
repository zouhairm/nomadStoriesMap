Text: "Have you ever been to a speakeasy? Well for me it was impossible cause in Mexico\
  \ there are no such places, we just don\xB4t have that tradition,  however last\
  \ year I found myself in Los Angeles, I was walking around Hollywood and Vine with\
  \ my headphones on, taking pictures while humming Sex on Fire by the Kings of Leon\
  \ because I would never dare to sing it out loud but I can hum and head bob to it.\
  \ \nWhile just around the corner a girl, 5 feet of sunshine and piercing deep blue\
  \ eyes, appeared. She passed by me and hear what I was humming, she touched my shoulder\
  \ and asked; \"have you ever listened sex on fire from a vinyl?\" I looked at her\
  \ and immediately went full idiot, I have known English since I was a little kid\
  \ but in that moment I blanked, I wanted to say that i haven\xB4t heard the KOL\
  \ on a vinyl but that I have been to one of their concerts, instead what came out\
  \ of my mouth was a stammering \"mpf\", she smiled.\nAfter a couples of seconds\
  \ my brain rebooted and was able to say that I would love to hear them on vinyl,\
  \ she gave me instructions to meet her at 9 in a pizza place 10 blocks away from\
  \ my hotel, I arrived 10 minutes early, she arrived 10 minutes late, we walked to\
  \ the end of the pizza parlour, passed the restrooms and enter a hidden staircase\
  \ that took us up to a beautiful little place, the moment we got in I realized I\
  \ was in one of those speakeasies that I had only read on books, it was hidden on\
  \ top of a pizza place, soundproofed and with thick curtains so no one could look\
  \ inside.\nIt was a date of cocktails and music, we went from the Bee Gees up to\
  \ lady Gaga without missing the Kinks and the Beatles, magic was present on that\
  \ night.\nNear 2 am, the girl went up to the DJ and passed him a note, he went to\
  \ the back of the place and took out an amazing black vinyl with an orange center,\
  \ he meticulously put it on the turntable and the people on the bar stood in silence\
  \ for a couple of seconds, then the magnificent chords we all know followed by the\
  \ first words of that great song \"lay where you\xB4re laying, don\xB4t make a sound\"\
  \ we were all excited feeling the music in our bones and as if all of the people\
  \ were gathered there just for encouraging me I grabbed the girl\xB4s hand pulled\
  \ her near me and whisper into her ear \"it sounds amazing on vinyl\", then we both\
  \ shouted \"you, your sex is on fire\".\nWe were the last customers of the place,\
  \ we end the night talking about movies and staring into each others eyes, I have\
  \ always thought that feelings are like little people inside all of us shouting\
  \ out instructions of what should we do, that night the little people inside me\
  \ were commanding me to kiss her, I took another shot of liquid courage and look\
  \ right into her, she pulled me next to her face and gave me the most amazing kiss\
  \ I had ever had, the lights went off and you could only see among shadows a couple\
  \ having their first kiss with fake candles shining around them like dimming fireflies\
  \ waiting to stop shining."
