Text: "On top of the world, life existence is so much challenging because you\u2019\
  ll never know what will happen to you from the past, present and future. \n\tI\u2019\
  ve been a person who keeps a lot secret in life but I\u2019ve never give up on fighting\
  \ on what I have to fight for in life.  I grew up consistently with a lot of issues\
  \ about family especially with my parents. I\u2019m at the age 4 when I\u2019ve\
  \ witnessed a very sad family life of my mom. My mom is being bombarded with a lot\
  \ of pain from my dad. Every time mom arrive home school, I see her being punched\
  \ by my dad. And so as time passed by, we grew up witnessing all the fights and\
  \ struggles of my mom with a terrible pain inside her. I remained tough for my mom\
  \ until such that life becomes so different when we decided to move out from my\
  \ dad. Our family went well when we decided to have our own home with our mom without\
  \ our dad but another secret came into my life that changes my whole personality.\
  \  My mom brought me out of this world and I\u2019m so thankful about it though\
  \ I\u2019m a daughter from a secret affair. I never doubted being raised by my mom\
  \ and biological dad. \n\tMy story is so much challenging itself and so I decided\
  \ to become a person through dealing with a lot of travels by observing the family\
  \ life of each place I came to visit. I want to be honest because I envy those who\
  \ have a very good relationship of family.  There comes a point that I need to interview\
  \ them and to sympathize or empathize them with their life situation because of\
  \ their painful struggle.  I came to a point that I carry my own heartache about\
  \ family but I came to realize that it shouldn\u2019t be the case.  I visited already\
  \ one country, they had the land of smile or shall I say it\u2019s Bangkok, Thailand.\
  \ \n\tIt is my first time to move out from comfort zone, I\u2019m on a place where\
  \ there are unknown things around me specifically their culture- a culture that\
  \ has no stress at all that they deal with full of happiness. I can say it because\
  \ it\u2019s been almost 6 months that I\u2019ve been here and people are so accommodating\
  \ that they seem to understand you even if you\u2019re not from Thailand itself.\
  \  Thai people are as gentle as the breeze of the wind that surpasses your expectation\
  \ of being in strange place yet it is nice as the temple you can compare to any\
  \ other countries.\n\tIn Thailand too, I\u2019ve been in loved with their greetings\
  \ to any elders, co- workers, co- teachers and also for the monks. I\u2019ve been\
  \ in loved too with their hierarchy of showing respect within the society.  It starts\
  \ with monks followed by the teachers, elders and young ones. Respect for me is\
  \ a very huge thing because it will show your humanitarian sense within the society;\
  \ in addition to that, it will also give a reflection of being a down to earth person\
  \ which indeed the most very important thing when dealing with people.  Now that\
  \ I\u2019m aware of what is going within their society, I\u2019m quite interested\
  \ of adapting their culture to my own country because somehow it will help lead\
  \ my own country to a most peaceful and orderly known Philippines. \n\tFinally,\
  \ the idea of leading yourself away from the comfort zone where you are about to\
  \ leave it, it is not a good but instead, it is nice to glance for a while because\
  \ it reminds you of many struggles that you surpassed through over time.  It also\
  \ will help you mend all the heart aches from the past to the present and to correct\
  \ it to the future life.  So with these travel I\u2019ve had, I know that it is\
  \ another challenge of my survival which can help me become more strong person facing\
  \ all the hard challenges I will have in life.  I\u2019m also looking forward of\
  \ becoming a better person with the help of positive people who supports for all."
