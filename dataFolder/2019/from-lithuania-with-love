Text: "\u201CWhat do I do now?\u201D I thought, as I sat on my suitcase in front of\
  \ the Panorama Mall in Vilnius. I looked at my watch; an hour had passed since my\
  \ sixteen-hour bus ride from Berlin ended at a nondescript bus stop on a side street\
  \ in the Lithuanian capital.\n\nI had taken a leap of faith with a familiar stranger,\
  \ a modern-day pen pal. I had mentioned in recent correspondence that I would be\
  \ travelling to Europe in a couple of weeks.  On a whim, we decided to meet in her\
  \ hometown of Vilnius.  So there I sat, assessing the grim nature of my situation:\
  \  I had no local money; I had no place to stay; I didn\u2019t speak Lithuanian;\
  \ my phone was almost out of credit; and my friend wasn\u2019t answering my calls.\
  \  Had I been stood up?  I watched the sun approach the unfamiliar horizon and started\
  \ contemplating my options when my phone rang.\n\nFifteen minutes later, a face\
  \ I recognized only from pictures came into view. She approached with a smile, my\
  \ own even bigger, with the relief of knowing that I was no longer stranded.  We\
  \ hopped on a faded red and yellow streetcar that looked like it had dropped straight\
  \ out of the 1950s Soviet Union.  She took me to an unnamed street on which there\
  \ was an apartment block.  Within the building was a hotel with four rooms, one\
  \ of which my friend had reserved on my behalf.   My hotel room was impressively\
  \ monochromatic, with the bed, walls, shelves, and carpet all matching.  This style\
  \ became a theme over the next few days.\n\nThe next morning, I headed over to my\
  \ friend\u2019s home for breakfast.  Her apartment block was run down, like something\
  \ you\u2019d see in Cold War-era spy movies.  It was constructed of prefabricated\
  \ concrete slabs, crudely cemented together.  The exterior was drab, grey, and utilitarian,\
  \ built in a time when function was the predominant focus.  The only splash of colour\
  \ came from the military-green mailboxes that lined the interior of the main floor.\
  \  The stairs leading up to the other levels were all worn down in the middle from\
  \ years of traffic.  My footsteps echoed off the cement walls as I raced up the\
  \ poorly lit stairwell, adding to the unwelcoming feel.  \n\nThe warm greeting I\
  \ received at the hallway door was a welcome contrast to the building\u2019s character.\
  \ From the entryway, the entire 200 square-foot apartment was in my view.  In the\
  \ kitchen was a small table, cut in half to fit over a radiator.  The combined bedroom-and-living\
  \ room had a pullout bed that she shared with her roommate.  It would be easy to\
  \ feel sympathy for someone whose living quarters were so tight, yet my friend was\
  \ happier than anyone I knew, because her space didn\u2019t define her.\n\nTouring\
  \ around Vilnius in the following days, I started to understand the city and its\
  \ residents.  From the vantage point atop the 15th-century Gediminas Tower, perched\
  \ above the Neris River, one can visualize the city\u2019s history.  South of the\
  \ river, colourful buildings in yellow, green, and blue, peaked with red rooftops,\
  \ reflect medieval times, while to the north, the bleak, industrial, grey concrete\
  \ world of the modern Soviet-built city takes over.  \n\nIn the old town of Vilnius\
  \ you will find the Republic of U\u017Eupis.  It is a micronation within Vilnius,\
  \ run by local artists.  U\u017Eupis represents an idea, and has a unique creativity\
  \ unparalleled elsewhere.  Tucked away on a small street is a wall with twenty-three\
  \ metal plaques, on each a translation of the Constitution of U\u017Eupis in a different\
  \ language, so that the world can see its great words.  I had headed to Lithuania\
  \ knowing little to nothing about the country; the Constitution\u2019s thirty-eight\
  \ articles gave me much more insight into Lithuania\u2019s people, their culture,\
  \ and what they have been through.  What resounded through my mind, in particular,\
  \ were three of the articles of the Constitution:\n\n\u201CEveryone has the right\
  \ to be unique.\u201D\n\u201CEveryone has the right to be loved.\u201D\n\u201CEveryone\
  \ has the right to look after a dog, until one of them dies.\u201D\n\nThese words\
  \ had me pondering, perhaps truth, love, and humour are all we really need?"
