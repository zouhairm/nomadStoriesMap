Text: "India, the country I really want to visit ever since I saw Shahrukh Khan in\
  \ his infamous movie, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. I was on 6th grade back then. The eagerness\
  \ is getting bigger when my boyfriend who happened to be an Indian, sent me a picture\
  \ of samosa he had for breakfast.\n\nTickets were booked, bags were packed, and\
  \ we\u2019re ready to explore the homeland of Bollywood. My friend, who was equally\
  \ enthusiastic about India, has agreed to accompany me in this journey.  After 7\
  \ hours of flying from Jakarta, we finally arrived in Delhi. \nThe warm breeze hit\
  \ our face as soon as we stepped out of the airport. It was pretty warm, even for\
  \ us who was used to the tropical weather. A lot of people were standing in front\
  \ of the arrival gate with the sign board on their chest. Among them, I saw two\
  \ men waving at us. Welcomed by a tight hug from my boyfriend and a handshake of\
  \ my friend\u2019s \u2018special friend\u2019, my heart was racing. I was totally\
  \ ready to explore this big city. \n\nWe ordered Uber to take us to the hotel we\
  \ have booked. I was so tired due to the long journey, but I can\u2019t help to\
  \ notice the hustle lied in front of me. It was 1 am, and I could see a lot of people\
  \ coming out of the airport looking for taxi, drivers who kept on honking their\
  \ horn to get their way out of the crowd, and people yelling to offer their taxi\
  \ service. \n\nIt took us around 40 minutes to get to our hotel which is located\
  \ in the Old Delhi. Not much of a view can be seen through the dusty car window,\
  \ as it was dark outside. We had to walk the rest of the journey as the hotel is\
  \ nestled inside of a small alley. I could see small shops lining up when we walked\
  \ to our hotel. This is definitely not a touristy area. We even had to hop over\
  \ a pretty big puddle along the muddy roads in order to keep our shoes dry.\n\n\u201C\
  We should come back before dark tomorrow. I don\u2019t feel good staying in this\
  \ area,\u201D my boyfriend whispered to me. I just nodded without questioning. He\
  \ warned me about the raping cases that happened a lot in India, and this city has\
  \ the highest rate.\n\nThe morning started with a simple breakfast provided by the\
  \ hotel. Then, we bid good bye to our boyfriends who could not join us due to duty\
  \ calls. Welcomed by the heat and a sweet smile from a lady sitting in her shop\
  \ across the hotel, we began our adventure. \n\nWe walked to the point where the\
  \ Uber driver dropped us, but the puddle were even bigger than last night, making\
  \ it impossible to pass through. We looked around to ask for direction, then that\
  \ sweet lady shouting and telling us in Hindi that we could walk around the alley\
  \ to get to the main road, or we think so. I noticed one thing during that conversation.\
  \ There\u2019s an open toilet where we bought our dinner last night, from a stall\
  \ sitting next to it. Mind blowing, but this is India, and I am not complaining.\
  \ The dinner was tasty.\n\nSo, we walked the other way as the sweet lady suggested\
  \ us. The alley is pretty narrow, old buildings were surrounding that area, crazy\
  \ amount of wires dangle over the buildings, and the smell. One step we could smell\
  \ the aromatic spices coming out from the pan of street food stalls, another steps\
  \ filled with the confusing funky smells. Bike Riders kept interrupting our walk\
  \ by honking so loudly at us to get their way. But, there is something calming about\
  \ walking in this area. It\u2019s like traveling back with the time machine. Like\
  \ we are inside of a black and white movie. \n\nI realized one thing. The big city\
  \ is just like our life, filled with traffic jam and pollution. Wearing us out.\
  \ But, we could simply find peace just by removing ourselves from the business of\
  \ the city and finding peace in a small alley we call family."
