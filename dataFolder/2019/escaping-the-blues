  \ LEISURE, coming true!!\nA place can have all the homely vibes if the people living\
  \ there are friendly and welcoming. Travelling is not for the ones who cannot deal\
  \ with a 9-5 job it is for those who can appreciate the beauty of the world with\
  \ welcoming arms.\nColonize your inner demons, let go of your mundane life, make\
  \ your every day more worthy than your previous one. Make your life worth living.\
  \ Travel and find yourself, fight your fears and take each breath of freedom and\
  \ tranquillity. \nIn the land where the sky is full of peace and serenity, who could\
  \ have imagined that once upon a time that same land was a battleground for India's\
  \ freedom struggle. Today, as I step onto the land a sense of freedom enters my\
  \ lungs through the aura of the place.\nANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS comes under\
  \ the union territory of India. This beauty mesmerizes oneself with its history,\
  \ architecture and its beautiful flora and fauna. Not to forget about its beaches!!\
  \ Apart from this, the disciplined lifestyle of the people residing there and the\
  \ strict law and order that they abide by are worth learning from. So here's a detailed\
  \ itinerary of my tour to the very beautiful and mesmerizing Andaman and Nicobar\
  \ Islands, India.\nCELLULAR JAIL NATIONAL MEMORIAL  \n  Well, the name can be mundane\
  \ and boring to one's ears but after entering you would be taken aback learning\
  \ about the history and the architecture associated with the place. It's a place\
  \ of Pride and valour for all Indians. The aura of the place takes you back to the\
  \ era of British Raj and how India's freedom fighters gave their life, serving the\
  \ nation and freeing them from slavery. It's a captivating view of the 7 wings radiating\
  \ from the watchtower.\nBEACHES\nHavelock island is a small island near Andaman,\
  \ 69kms away from Port Blair which is the capital of the Andaman. There are many\
  \ ferries/ships available to reach the place. It is a 2-hour long journey to this\
  \ captivating place. The island has world best beaches like Radhanagar beach, Elephant\
  \ beach etc having crystal clear water, white shiny sand and various fun activities\
  \ such as elephant ride and scuba diving.\nSCUBA DIVING\nThe main highlight of the\
  \ vacation is scuba diving. The breathtaking corals and reefs leave you spellbound.\
  \ It takes you all together to a new enchanting world, where there is absolute tranquillity.\
  \ No noise, no worries about anything just peace! It gives you some amount of time\
  \ to reflect on your life. There's absolute silence, so much so that even your movement\
  \ underwater seems absolute fluid and from the depth of the water when you see upwards\
  \ towards the sky, you will see a ray of sunlight bringing along the rays of positivity\
  \ in the otherwise dark waters. It's really worth your time and money!!\n      \
  \      The pace of life in the Andaman's is slow but steady.\n                 \
  \      Stories of the beach life are breathtaking.\nIt's so surreal to visit a place\
  \ where history stands tall, glorifying each and every corner with its struggle.\
  \ Showing its strength and weakness in the same frame. On one side it's the history\
  \ showcasing pain and discomfort and on the other side, there are beaches with its\
  \ pristine beauty telling us never to stop and look back for the trace of sadness\
  \ that will only harden and deepen our sorrows and very reluctantly stop us from\
  \ enjoying our present and our future. It's a reminder that our work is just a small\
  \ part of our life. A quick getaway will allow us to view the world through broader\
  \ and bigger lenses. Exploring such a possibility will only make us learn to view\
  \ the world from a better perspective, by which all our mental and emotional trauma\
  \ will vanish and we would be able to breathe air filled with freedom from life's\
  \ hustle and bustle, from the rat race and above all will give us some space to\
  \ listen to our heart's content. \nSo grab your opportunity and take the leap into\
  \ the unknown and make the most out of it!!!"
