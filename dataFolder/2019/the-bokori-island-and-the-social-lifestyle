Text: "We have often heard that islands in the southeast Sulawesi province are indeed\
  \ amazing. Clusters of islands that offer each of their potential make the island\
  \ have their own advantages. Hear southeast Sulawesi, always remember Wakatobi,\
  \ or maybe the island of Buton. But, there is one island that is very well known\
  \ in Southeast Sulawesi. For the local community this island has been known to them\
  \ since the island is still inhabited until it has been inhabited by residents.\n\
  Bokori Island, an island located not far from the city of Kendari, namely the capital\
  \ city of the Southeast Sulawesi province. The island is the frontline for the city\
  \ of Kendari tourism, even though the island is territorial in Konawe district.\
  \ This is because, to reach this island, the city of Kendari is the only city that\
  \ is used as a stopover to this island.\nFor the matter of costs, don't worry. We\
  \ can rent fishing boats from the land bokori community, which used to be residents\
  \ of the bokori island itself. This crossing access has become the lifestyle of\
  \ the local residents after Bokori Island was declared as a family recreation center\
  \ by the local government. With the support of cottages, villas, and camping land,\
  \ it seems that you have enough to pay for your fatigue after doing a lot of your\
  \ work activities.\nWell, fellow readers, it is this lifestyle that begins to shift\
  \ from activity before they move from being fishermen (permanent jobs) to being\
  \ a passenger delivery service to the island. For once crossing, you will be charged\
  \ a tariff of Rp. 250,000, -. \"Well, how, is there still enough savings?\" For\
  \ the entry fee is quite cheap, namely at the price of Rp. 10,000, - outside cottage\
  \ inns or villas.\nFor rental villas and cottages, the price ranges from Rp. 400,000\
  \ up to Rp. 1,000,000. Hmmm, it looks like my friends are starting to cool the money,\
  \ hahaha. In addition, there are a number of water games such as banana boats, donut\
  \ boats that will take you at high speed through the vast waters of the bokori island.\
  \ My advice when you are going to this island, stop for a while to chat with local\
  \ residents to find out their history of leaving the island. Because, they were\
  \ ordered to leave the island by the government with various assumptions. The number\
  \ of infectious diseases, the sinking of the island, and there will be large faults\
  \ on the island. Well of course, this is the first step before you stay on this\
  \ island.\nBesides that, the lives of Bajo people who have inhabited the mainland\
  \ island of Southeast Sulawesi, all you need to know is the local kearfian and the\
  \ hospitality of the people themselves. Settlements above the waters with typical\
  \ Bajo community buildings can be seen throughout your journey to the pier. The\
  \ boisterous voices of the Bajo children running around the house and the streets\
  \ made of boards instantly turn your holiday atmosphere into an amazing one.\nThe\
  \ typical skin is dark due to sun exposure and the activities of mothers who use\
  \ cold powder while sitting at the front door of their house you can also watch.\
  \ The smile emanating from the ina-ina of the Bajo will be a complement to your\
  \ trip to the island. Bajo residents are a sub ethnic group in Indonesia with their\
  \ livelihood as fishermen. For most Bajo residents who are on the mainland of Southeast\
  \ Sulawesi (the city of Kendari) being a fisherman is a sure thing and an introduction\
  \ to tourists is a must for them. To support the government to increase the tourism\
  \ potential of Southeast Sulawesi province.\nDear readers, what is really the most\
  \ typical of these settlements. You know that the Bajo community's fishing is used\
  \ as a livelihood for the village mothers. Drying salt fish that has a distinctive\
  \ smell, is the main thing you will breathe. Ebi shrimp that will be used as shrimp\
  \ paste, decorate their home page. \nIn addition, when you visit one of the houses\
  \ in the village. Don't be surprised, because it will be difficult for you to find\
  \ a toilet. Because, they are so guarding their local wisdom anymore"
