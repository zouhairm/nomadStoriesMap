Text: "South of Campeche, about 7 hrs from the city of M\xE9rida I have finally arrived\
  \ at Zoh Laguna, a small community that belongs to the municipality of Calakmul.\
  \ To get here we chose the path  \"alternative \" So from M\xE9rida we took a second\
  \ truck that took us to Hopelchen in Campeche, was a light journey of about 3 hrs.\
  \ I had never been to Holepchen before but I had great references that I would find\
  \ a lot of Mennonites settlements. It was a Sunday that day we arrived and it was\
  \ noticeable the concurrence of Mennonites in the town square and given my deep\
  \ interest in them spent the rest of the afternoon in the park watching them, do\
  \ not misunderstand me, are very friendly and respectful people but I  Like to see\
  \ their hats and clothes made by themselves, their shade of yellow skin, blond hair\
  \ and smiles contained;   As is to be suppose I did not take the desire and I went\
  \ to talk with some girls, I chose the only brunette in the group to start the talk,\
  \ I know... Strange decision, why the brunette think, but I was very surprised to\
  \ see that between Mennonites Gueras and Blue Eye would have a brunette skin girl\
  \ like me.He appeared as Rufina, is from Belize, says Saber Maya, Spanish, a little\
  \ Dutch but prefers to speak in English, currently living in Canada and only this\
  \ missionary spreading the Gospel in Holpechen and communities nearby, exchanged\
  \ numbers in the hope that Pu Eda I keep asking him questions like that afternoon.\n\
  At dusk we took the next bus that would take us to our last destination: Zoh Laguna.\n\
  This community south of the jungle Campechan has a past of abundance and progress\
  \ of which remain as testimony the beautiful architecture of the town, all the houses\
  \ made of boards and two waters, walking two blocks and you feel teleported to a\
  \ distant Pu Eblo in Poland with tropical dye.\n This old community settled here\
  \ to work the gum industry and later for the exploitation of precious woods such\
  \ as oak and mahogany. As it should be the wood is over, they exploited the jungle\
  \ until it could not be more, so the sawmill \"Caobas Mexicanas\" lost its license\
  \ to extract forest resources, they had to go to loot some other jungle and as compensation\
  \ to their workers it was allowed to keep their homes. On this side they will note\
  \ that it is a \"tutti frutti campechano\" of residents in Zoh Laguna, Veracruz,\
  \ Quintana Roo, Tabasco, Chiapas and Yucatan, you can tell by walking on this side\
  \ you hear their talk in Tzotzil, the opposite with an accent here, others with\
  \ an accent from there, mayeros and the odd foreigner to visit here.\nApparently\
  \ the people in this town miss those days of opulence with Mexican Caobas, the dances,\
  \ the cinema and a hospital that does not exist anymore. To the decline of the sawmill,\
  \ the economy was stopped by what its inhabitants have adapted self-employed Do\xF1\
  a Mari for example sells some very delicious tamales coladitos, the lady who sells\
  \ atol, the neighbor who weaves hammocks, that taxi driver, the boss of the tendej\xF3\
  n and does not miss the neighbor who also works his plot and his bees.Today we have\
  \ the vestiges of that boom, a beautiful and small community, with its colorful\
  \ wooden houses, in general a quiet place, where silence and birds often fill the\
  \ void."
