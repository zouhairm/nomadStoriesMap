Text: "It was early in the week when I learned that my cousin was taking a trip to\
  \ Dubai. No stranger to spontaneous travel, I acted quickly. One subtle message\
  \ to her expressing interest in the trip led to a plane ticket being bought for\
  \ that weekend, my characteristic way of maintaining an impulsive, nomadic lifestyle\
  \ within the confines of the standard work week. \n\nUnlike my typical travel standards\
  \ of bodega breakfasts and budget-bus backpacking, my cousin travels well, and I\
  \ was eager to see the world from her perspective. Already mentally stimulated by\
  \ the Arabic menus on the Emirates flight, the late-night airport arrival and subsequent\
  \ highway procession was littered with cab driver stories of the \u2018Old Dubai,\u2019\
  \ a mere fishing village just thirty years prior. \n\nWe stopped at a traffic light\
  \ as my eyes began to widen, attempting to absorb the scope of structures around\
  \ me. The overly air-conditioned atmosphere sent chills down my forehead as I leaned\
  \ against the frigid backseat window. On the other side of that glass was something\
  \ much, much different: the great desert heat of the Middle East. I was on the edge\
  \ of my seat.\n\nIt became evident as we entered downtown that the hotel couldn\u2019\
  t be far from us now. My wanderer instincts kicked in and I decided to tackle the\
  \ rest of the journey by foot. Unfortunately, my pedestrian lifestyle was no match\
  \ for the ramps and overpasses of vehicular circulation that built this desert city.\
  \ Eventually, I\u2019d know to use the pedestrian bridges rather than search for\
  \ crosswalks, but that was a lesson I had yet to learn.\n\nPockets of public wi-fi\
  \ paired with countless Google Maps screenshots eventually led me to the hotel,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t sleep much. The choreographed fountains could be seen dancing\
  \ through the patio door, in front of which a passageway of illuminated palms gestured\
  \ towards the Burj Khaifa. There it was: the tallest building in the world, the\
  \ embodiment of human ambition in built form. My wide-eyed adrenaline was ready\
  \ to soak up every second of this.\n\nWe crammed as much activity as possible into\
  \ the next 24 hours: all the places I\u2019d only ever dreamed of seeing. We strolled\
  \ the Dubai Marina, drove out onto the palm shaped island archipelago, conducted\
  \ a photo shoot in front of a 6-star hotel, and \u2018bashed\u2019 the dunes of\
  \ the Red Sand Desert. Even a small trek to Abu Dhabi to see the Sheikh Zayed Mosque\
  \ wasn\u2019t too far out of reach. Having grown accustomed to a rigorous, time-consuming\
  \ work schedule, I was reminded of how many hours in a day there truly were: enough\
  \ to really see the world if you made the effort to.  \n\nAs it turned out, a miscommunication\
  \ in flight times meant that my cousin was departing the night before I was, so\
  \ I needed a place to stay. Dozens of listing appeared on my hotel app, so I picked\
  \ one at random in the general direction of the airport. Upon checking in, the concierge\
  \ reminded me, \u2018Don\u2019t forget to check out the rooftop:\u201D exactly the\
  \ kind of suggestion I was hoping to hear.\n\nQuickly dropping my bags in the room,\
  \ I sprinted upstairs, only to be greeted by a sea of sparkling skyscrapers. Club\
  \ music oscillated from the surrounding speakers and I made my way to a lounge chair\
  \ pointed right out towards the skyline. This was my first moment of reflection.\
  \ Without worry or dread, I was overcome with the reminder that in 24 hours, I\u2019\
  d be sitting on my bus on the morning commute, surrounded by people with their headphones\
  \ in and their eyes fixated on their devices, with no awareness of or curiosity\
  \ towards this world I\u2019d just encountered. Life would go on as usual. Yet this\
  \ time, I\u2019d have this image burned in the back of my mind: the image of this\
  \ rooftop and the joy and ease of getting there. Therein I was assured; anything\
  \ really is possible."
