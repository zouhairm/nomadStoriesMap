Text: "Dadaji had told me stories from sixty-five years back.  \nFour hours, eighty\
  \ miles and a few mustard fields back I was still in the 21st century. But I am\
  \ pretty sure time travel is still not feasible.  \nBANDHUAN KALAN.  \nPerfect place\
  \ to hide during a Zombie Apocalypse.  Maybe? Google Maps failed. Thanks to Dadaji\u2019\
  s memory, it was the only way we found our way here. Our Traveller had to stop a\
  \ kilometer away because roads weren\u2019t wide enough to get in.  A small village,\
  \ pretty much a large family, hidden in the interiors of the overpopulated North\
  \ Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. Roughly a large acre of land, with a total headcount\
  \ of a hundred or so people, a hundred or so cows, and the blessings of a hundred\
  \ or so gods.  \nHouses that would shatter anytime the wind decided to be fierce\
  \ enough. Men lay under the sun all day, would plow their fields if they desired\
  \ to do so. Their wives struggled to burn the chulha, filling their lungs with all\
  \ kinds of carbon only to see their families stay full and happy. The children ran\
  \ across the village playing quirky Indian games and had absolutely no other work.\
  \   \nDadaji\u2019s father used to be the village Sarpanch 30 years back and so\
  \ everyone seemed to know Dadaji. All of us were welcomed with open arms, wide smiles\
  \ and wider hearts. They looked so happy to see us as a five-year-old, on a Christmas\
  \ morning.   \nRadheysham, Dadaji\u2019s old neighbor, still lived here. He hugged\
  \ him. Mom and Dad bowed down to touch his feet. I waited for a while, not knowing\
  \ how to proceed. Then followed my mother\u2019s quick eye movements, commanding\
  \ me to do what they did. I quickly bowed down too. Once. Twice. Thrice and at least\
  \ seven more people to go, because remember, I am an Indian standing in a large,\
  \ long-lost family of unrecognized faces, making sure I keep my first impression\
  \ decent. But that is the thing about us Indians, no matter whether we know a person\
  \ or whether the person shares our blood, we ought to Namaste and touch their feet.\
  \  \nSo, we were guests now, and quite important apparently. And I, was especially\
  \ new to the scenario. Never had I ever been outside urban territories and all of\
  \ this seemed pretty much fictitious. It was too hard to sit back and indulge in\
  \ family relations. There hadn\u2019t been such escapades in my life before and\
  \ I had absolutely no clue if I would ever get to return.  I swiftly shifted ways\
  \ as no one looked, changed my direction to escape the family and, to explore Bandhua\
  \ Kalan.  \nSurprisingly confident in such unknown territory; I crossed roads and\
  \ took a few cuts here and there, through muddy broken paths and waist-high wheat\
  \ crops. Stepping into cow feces, slipping on wet soil and, tripping over broken\
  \ pavements, I trod the village. Dogs and children ran at an equal pace all-round\
  \ the \u201Clarge acre of land\u201D. There was hardly any business or commotion.\
  \ Young girls rolling beedis then stitching and weaving. Boys were taught crafting\
  \ brassware because brass brought home money. All they needed was a little amount\
  \ of cash to have two compelling meals a day.   \nLife was straight.   \nYou are\
  \ born. You grow a little old. If you are a girl, they tell you how to do the chores,\
  \ if you are a boy, they tell you ways to earn. By the time you turn eighteen, you\
  \ are married off to a stranger and spend the rest of your life at \u2018his\u2019\
  \ mercy or as \u2018her\u2019 \u201CParmeshwar\u201D, literally Hindi for God. Now,\
  \ for the next forty years; if you are a wife you do the cooking and cleaning and\
  \ if you are the husband you cultivate land and find jobs. If you manage to live\
  \ longer, you bask.   \nI spent hours strolling multiple times, each alley and turn.\
  \ Studying people and, their lives, without actually talking to them. Everything\
  \ seemed new to my eyes. Ironically, old to my brain. But I had to move. With every\
  \ step I took, reminding myself, this was still how people lived in parts of the\
  \ world."
