Text: "Once upon a time, yes, like all fairy tales, this story begins like this. Big\
  \ city, full of old buildings, iconic monuments, romantic language, and many people,\
  \ plus 4 Chilean girls with all the energy to discover! Hello Paris!\nWe arrived\
  \ in the morning from Rome, as good students that we were: economic flight, backpack\
  \ and hunger !. We landed in Beauvais, took train and headed to the capital city,\
  \ honestly a little bit scared, we had been told that the French people were cold\
  \ and did not like foreigners, so we were a little quiet on the trip, started to\
  \ relaxed little by little, and from that moment the Chilean accent was heard in\
  \ all the wagons. As we arrived in the city a guy approached us, told us that he\
  \ was French and also spoke Spanish because he had studied in Spain, he thought\
  \ our accent was funny and he knew what it was like to be an Erasmus student so\
  \ he gave us tickets for the Subway, very grateful we accepted them and asked many\
  \ questions until we got off the train.\nFirst stop was the hostel, nearby Bastille,\
  \ we leave our stuffs there and we are dedicated to discover the city. The first\
  \ stop Parc de la Villette, we wanted to meet it because we had studied it once,\
  \ i had not mentioned that we studied Architecture. We dedicated to take pictures,\
  \ and go back to downtown, we wanted to continue with our odyssey, we only had 3\
  \ days and our visiting places list was long, and like good Chileans girls, always\
  \ late! But leaving the best for last, you can imagine what I mean !, Yes that's\
  \ it, the magnificent and wonderful Eiffel Tower, which was in the last day, I remember\
  \ it very well, was Thursday, and our flight was at 8 in the afternoon, so at 6\
  \ we should be at the airport.\nSo 5:30pm we were taking the subway to pick up our\
  \ things from the hostel, running, excuse me we are late, then take our backpacks,\
  \ which weighed more than before, be on the train to Beauvais, wait there for a\
  \ bus to take us to the airport, which did not happen So, we had to stop a car asking\
  \ him to take us there, offering him some money, it was a couple of old people who\
  \ helped us gently. We arrived at the airport, and it was already 7:30 p.m., and\
  \ the girl from counter tells us that it is not possible to board, because we arrived\
  \ late, so we begged, crying, asking please to let us board the plane, but nothing\
  \ worked. We asked the price of the next plane and it was very expensive, so we\
  \ decided to go back to Paris and stay a few days more there and buy another flight\
  \ ticket but cheaper.\nWe arrived in Paris at about 9:30 at night, went directly\
  \ to the hostel to ask for a room, impossible ita was full !, and we were looking\
  \ around, all were very expensive, we could not pay that amount of money, with this\
  \ results we did not know what to do. So we decided to go to a subway station which\
  \ it had a gallery, and spend the whole night there. We were protected from  cold\
  \ and there were more people, homeless and dogs, we settled and ready to sleep,\
  \ when some policemen arrived and they started to kick everyone out of the place,\
  \ so dogs, homeless and us evicting the \u201Chostel\u201D!\nFrom there we started\
  \ to get desperate and hopeless, so we walked looking for more hostels and zero\
  \ results, until we found a church and it was open,  we entered, there were the\
  \ same roommates from gallery, so a friend slept on the pews and us 3 on the floor,\
  \ just right in the middle was the ventilation of the subway, therefore, it was\
  \ warm and finally we closed our eyes, until when we woke up and first image was:\
  \ the church was full, there was a piano playing and a priest in front of us. Amen!\n\
  Thank it was not wedding day"
