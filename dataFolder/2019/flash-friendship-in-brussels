Text: "- Maybe it's better if we go toghether. Don\u2019t you think?.- Oeuyown told\
  \ me. My new american friend.\nShe was a girl from Virginia and, the same as I,\
  \ it was the first time she visited Belgium. We just had met fifteen minutes before\
  \ in a metro station in Brussels and we were both a little bit lost. \n-Sure, let's\
  \ go!.- I answered enthusiastically but without having any idea of what to do next.\n\
  \ It was my first time wandering. And for me this trip was almost like a \"living\
  \ la vida loca\" experience since I arrived to the country to visit my cousin.\n\
  By the other hand, Oeuyown planned on going to an art exhibition in the afternoon\
  \ and then going back to Paris, where a friend of hers lives.\n-Sounds interesting!\
  \ But... look. Someone told me that there's a really nice pub in the Grand Place.\
  \ And Belgium is known for its beers. So, would you like to drink something and\
  \ then you go to that art exhibition?.- I persuaded her as if I were a bad influence\
  \ or something.\n-Yeah! Why not?.- She shrugged with a smile on her face.\nI remember\
  \ that we walked a lot, watching our maps on the cellphones to find the highly recommended\
  \ pub.  After strolling through the alleys full of restaurants, colorful chocolat\
  \ markets and the corner of the Manneken Pis, we finally got there. \nIt was an\
  \ underground pub with barrel tables and the ceiling plenty of big models of beer\
  \ lids. We sat at the bar and asked for some beers.\n-Look at that barman. He\u2019\
  s really handsome, isn\u2019t he?.-Oeuyown whispered.\n-I didn\u2019t notice him\u2026\
  \ but you\u2019re right. He\u2019s good-looking...- I said. I tried to act as normal\
  \ as possible then, but sometimes I peeked into the direction where he was. \nAfter\
  \ a pair of beers, the alcohol began to work. We look at each other and we thought\
  \ that was a good idea for an espresso, so we could recover our energy.\nThe time\
  \ flew and while we talk about what was in and out of our lives, I realized that\
  \ I was crumpling a slip of paper unconsciously.\n-Wait\u2026 Why there\u2019s a\
  \ slip of paper below my espresso?.-  I thought aloud. \n-What is it?.- Oeuyown\
  \ was curious.\nIt was a phone number with a heart drawing on it. His name was Jean.\n\
  I looked up and I saw Jean\u2019s deep blue eyes staring at me  while he was filling\
  \ up a cup with beer. \n-Are you gonna text him back?.- she asked me.\n-I think\
  \ so. Maybe I\u2019ll text him tonight\u2026 - I answered. \nWe stayed at the pub\
  \ a little bit longer and then we went for another walk. \n-You know  I\u2019m having\
  \ a great time here in Brussels. And I found a hostel for tonight, so what if we\
  \ enjoy what this night brings.- Oeuyown invites me.\nSuddenly, we became the best\
  \ travel buddies for the day.\nThen I remembered Jean. It was night already and\
  \ I had to take a train at 00:15 to go back to my cousin\u2019s house. However I\
  \ had few time, I decided to text him anyway. I told him we were waiting at the\
  \ Grand Place.\nAfter a while he text me back: \u201CI\u2019ll be there in 10 minutes\u201D\
  .\nAnd I saw him. He was smiling, just the same as I. But I had to told him that\
  \ I had to go soon.\nHe didn\u2019t mind at all and took us to a nice place to talk\
  \ and the minutes left flew by below the glowing street lights.  \nIt was 00:00\
  \ and I had forgotten the most important thing: where was the train station? \n\
  Luckily, Jean guided me there quickly. So I was truly thankful.\n-If I were on your\
  \ shoes, I know you would have done the same. Remember this day as a crazy day.-\
  \ He embraced me.\nThen I said goodbye to Oeuyown and we wish to each other nothing\
  \ but the best.\nFinally, the train left the platform just in time. \nSince then\
  \ I can say that exciting days do not depend on the place, but the people. Even\
  \ in the most common situations."
