Text: "This is everything my mother warned me against, I thought as the thin Spaniard\
  \ slipped out from behind the steering wheel. He slid open the door of his den \u2013\
  \ a big, black van, complete with a makeshift bed, Buddhist trinkets hanging from\
  \ the roof and two mangy dogs loitering at the door. Victor, the Spaniard declared,\
  \ extending a calloused hand.\n\nThe dogs squirreled back to their hideout underneath\
  \ the bed as we tried to take everything in. Shaking, I whispered something in Afrikaans\
  \ to my travel partner, Suzaan, and we looked at Josephine Grape in the front seat\
  \ - fit as a fiddle and comfortable as a cat. Victor slams the door, gets back behind\
  \ the wheel and guns the engine. A journey so unexpected that our rumbling tummies\
  \ had to remind us that we haven\u2019t even thought of breakfast, lunch or dinner.\n\
  \nIt began two nights before. Suzaan and I met Josephine at a Couchsurfer. Having\
  \ to share the close quarters of a Maldovan volunteer, we were forced to become\
  \ quite close. She has been a nomad for eight years, travelled to 60 countries and\
  \ can speak 12 languages. She told us about headhunters in Somalia, fishing in Gambia\
  \ and the pink dolphins of the Amazon. Her woven locks were knotted into a bun and\
  \ she shut her eyes as she sang to us in Swahili, gently plucking at a guitar she\u2019\
  d engraved with a fork \u2013 a guitar she was gifted a week before and would exchange\
  \ for food and lodging the week after. She evangelised about travelling alone, and\
  \ whilst teaching us how to hitchhike, invited us to join her the following day.\
  \ She was planning to meet a friend in Cadiz and travel to Tarifa \u2013 the travellers\
  \ Mecca. Enamoured and enraptured, we were up at dawn and on our way.\n\nThe first\
  \ hike was easy, but as the sun rose higher cars raced more hastily past us, hikers\
  \ on a hopeless trek. We tried everything. Intersections, petrol stations, singing,\
  \ dancing \u2013 even signs, to grab the attention of the next willing, four-wheeled\
  \ Samaritan. Eight hours later, we met Victor at the train station.\n\nSo, there\
  \ we were, the four of us en route to Tarifa chewing on peanuts and dry apples in\
  \ that monstrous van with the two dogs ( the black one was named Carma, and biologically,\
  \ yes, she was a bitch). The van reeked of incants and mutt, but somehow it blended\
  \ well with the Spanish countryside and the song that kept repeating \u2013 \u201C\
  woman is mah sista, woman is mah motha\u201D. He was thoroughly strange, this Spanish\
  \ Victor. Constantly battling with his Valencian lisp, knotting his tongue trying\
  \ to keep up with the English. Sometimes he would switch over to Spanish and Jo\
  \ would laugh and translate. She told us how excited he was for us to see Tarifa\
  \ and her beauty. That we must sleep on the beach, dance and watch the lights of\
  \ the Moroccan buildings grow brighter on the horizon.\n\nWhen we finally arrived,\
  \ after spending a night on the beach and two days on the road, we were surprised\
  \ to find that there was no one. Tarifa was quiet. Only a few tourists, locals and\
  \ an Australian hippie wandering around the supermarket. Victor said it was because\
  \ of the wind. The nomads follow the sun, he said. And I guess he was right, because\
  \ Josephine left us before the sun set. She decided that she wanted to take a boat\
  \ to Morocco and she hitched to the docks of Algeciras. That evening Suzaan and\
  \ I sat on the beach in silence. We longed to hear some moon drums or the songs\
  \ of different tongues. But as soon as the light started dying, the silence was\
  \ all we needed. We watched as the sun bled into the ocean, kissing Europe and Africa\
  \ goodnight\u2026 Home had never felt so far and yet so close.\n\nThat next morning,\
  \ we greeted Victor, the dogs and Tarifa. On the bus we took a last glance at the\
  \ sea, wondering if Josephine Grape was swimming in different waters. Our rebellion\
  \ felt sweet. Mothers don\u2019t know everything after all."
