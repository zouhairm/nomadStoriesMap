Text: "Waking up to the silence of a land unknown, I opened the double-sided wooden\
  \ door, to close my eyes as the wind blew gently into my face. With a smile, I breathe\
  \ in the smell of a new place. My heart pumped out excitement to discover a place\
  \ which only in dreams I have been, I felt the adrenaline rush into my head in each\
  \ step I took. Squished between locals, I sat through a bumpy jeep ride, as unknown\
  \ languages and sounds echoed deep in my ears. My eagerness could not wait to open\
  \ my eyes into the views outside, yet all I could see were headless bodies of locals\
  \ who clung outside, on the steps of the jeep. Finally, I stepped out of the jeep\
  \ and turned back to get one glance of it before I take the next step forward. With\
  \ wonderment in my eyes, I noticed every detail from the old wooden doors, to people\
  \ sitting by the roads with a cigarette in one hand and a glass of tea in the other,\
  \ to the jingle from a woman\u2019s anklets as she walked with three earthen pots\
  \ on her head. As I walked through the muddy bushes, immersed in the petrichor,\
  \ my eyes squinted from the sparkling waters of a creek. Leaving behind my shoes,\
  \ I empty my pockets and step in to the clear waters to feel a tingle pass from\
  \ my toes to head. With water upto my calves, I stood hypnotized by the pebbles\
  \ of millions of colors, until I jumped from a prick on my feet. I turned back to\
  \ find a school of fishes swimming away from me. Giggling at myself, I took a step\
  \ forward to get the next prick from a crimson sharp pebble, naturally polished\
  \ by the waters. I put the pebble in my pocket and walked carefully. With my jaw-dropped,\
  \ I stood in a gigantic cave of rocks as high as a three storied building on either\
  \ sides of me, with water gushing on the ground. On every step that I took, the\
  \ water had a greater force. With water upto my waist, and rocks above my head,\
  \ almost making a ceiling, I stood in front of a waterfall inside the cave. Not\
  \ able to go any further, I managed to climb up the slippery rocks to find a mini-cave\
  \ within. My feet could feel the cold rocks of the mini-cave as water dripped from\
  \ the rock-ceiling of the cave. Getting a complete view of the cave, the waterfalls\
  \ in between, the clear water and pebbles below me, I stood holding the slimy surface\
  \ of the rocks above my head. Yelling out a \u201CWoo-hoo!\u201D, the caves kept\
  \ yelling back Woo-hoos at me, until I couldn\u2019t hear them anymore. With the\
  \ height of the mini-cave decreasing, I climb down the rocks. As I walked through\
  \ the water, the cave became brighter. I looked above to find the rock ceiling widening\
  \ apart, until the rocks on either side of me ended. There, I stood again, in the\
  \ sparkling creek."
