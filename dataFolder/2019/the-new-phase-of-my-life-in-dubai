Text: "I was 6 years old when my mum died, my dad took me to the Dubai to get going\
  \ and start a new life. I was that old school girl from a small town in India where\
  \ I studied in Gujarati medium, not knowing English language at all.\nI was admitted\
  \ to the school hoping to get my life better, as I was small didn\u2019t know much\
  \ about sorrows and those emotional emptiness from which my dad and my family was\
  \ going through. \nFrom one side my dad was new in upbringing me, as he always stayed\
  \ away from us in Dubai and we stayed in India, but he still managed to take care\
  \ of me by making breakfast for me, grooming me for the school everyday, ironing\
  \ my clothes, helping me with my homework etc. And from other side I was managing\
  \ myself in learning English and also a new language called Arabic, which is the\
  \ mother tongue of the United Arab Emirates.\nCommunicating with other students\
  \ and teachers in the school was a task for me, I felt like an illiterate. Going\
  \ through all of this made me stronger and confident, and English? Yes I learnt\
  \ it very well, by the time. I and dad healed each other and had some great time\
  \ as well together. After a year my dad got married again and we had our new life\
  \ and family.\nSo this was about my personal life, let\u2019s get back on my travel\
  \ story and my experiences in Dubai and other emirates in United Arab Emirates.\n\
  Dubai has a combination of modern tall glass skyscraper along with a hippie kind\
  \ of a vibe with the mosques and other beautiful places.\nI stayed there for almost\
  \ three years from 2003-2006. So let\u2019s start with the golden place, which is\
  \ the Gold Souk market, it is the largest gold market, it\u2019s in the area called\
  \ Deira. I know this market because my father used to work there, it is the shiniest\
  \ place of Dubai, filled with lots of jewelry shops, mannequins draped with big\
  \ necklaces and other pieces.\nIt takes waterworks to travel some areas in the city\
  \ here and there. Every week on Friday, as it used to be my holiday in school our\
  \ family used to go on outing to different malls and parks (stating the Dubai mall\
  \ was built during this duration) it\u2019s the largest mall in the world.  \nThere\
  \ comes the talking of the food \u2013 Dates and spices are the delight, and Falafel\
  \ sandwiches, hammus-khabus and much more! This is what we had on weekend dinners.\
  \ As I\u2019m an Indian so I cannot forget national food also, so for maintaining\
  \ my native cravings we also had many Indian cuisine joints.\nThe city also smells\
  \ very great, which is this city sells amazing perfumes handmade from natural flowers\
  \ to which they call \u201Cittar\u201D in their local language, which is also a\
  \ pride to their lifestyle.\nThey do live a royal lifestyle with disciplined values\
  \ to their culture in terms of worshipping their god, wearing a burkha, welcoming\
  \ millions of tourist everyday, serving them great services and also entertaining\
  \ them.\nEntertainment? Oh yes! This city leaves nothing incomplete, we had a very\
  \ big family friends group with whom we used to visit desert safari quite often.\
  \ Males from the group used to have hookahs we used to have amazing jeep rides and\
  \ watch the great Belly dancing, which blew our mind! Don\u2019t forget the palm\
  \ jumeirah beach which gives you amazing shots to capture in the early morning,\
  \ with the Burj Al Arab accompanying you in the picture.\nHave you heard of 7 wonders\
  \ coming together at the same place? Well you can have a small part of all these\
  \ at the place called \u201CGlobal Village\u2019 which is located at Sheikh Mohammad\
  \ Bin Zayed road. It is the world\u2019s largest tourism, leisure, shopping area\
  \ which combines cultures of 90 countries from the world, where people can shop,\
  \ see their exhibits and cultural stuffs from their country and can fulfill the\
  \ cravings of fun-park as well.\nSo this is what I gotta tell you from my three\
  \ year experience, which was amazing and mesmerizing ."
