Text: "Torrents of sweat pooled in my lower back. Even in mid-morning, the tropical\
  \ air sagged with heat, coating my skin in a layer of moisture. Today marked two\
  \ weeks in Colombia and while my body proved slow to adjust, my clothing permanently\
  \ drenched, it hadn\u2019t stopped me from ticking off the must-see sights. Hiking\
  \ along beaches, ambling through cities, and scrambling along rows of coffee trees,\
  \ I\u2019d certainly seen my fair share of the country. And yet, as I followed Eskil\
  \ through the streets of Cartagena, wiping yet another droplet from my eyes, I felt\
  \ as though I hadn\u2019t yet truly experienced the country. \n\nRounding a corner,\
  \ we hurried across an intersection toward a circular stall, its metal facade glimmering\
  \ in the sunshine. Inside stood a gentleman who, noting our arrival, began tugging\
  \ and pulling his long sleeve jacket until certain it draped perfectly. Spreading\
  \ styrofoam cups across the countertop as easily as one dealt cards, he introduced\
  \ himself as Lazarus, a 67 year old Cartage\xF1a native who, when asked his marital\
  \ status responded, \u201CI\u2019m single. It\u2019s my wife who is married.\u201D\
  \ Cracking a smile that encompassed him entirely, Lazarus explained he\u2019d spent\
  \ the last fifty years crafting one single dish: the shrimp cocktail. \n\nPlacing\
  \ a hat on his head, Lazarus glanced upward encouraging me to follow. Stomach rumbling,\
  \ my eyes eventually came to rest on the roof of his stall where, rather than tin,\
  \ there sat an exact replica of his sombrero, from the curve of its brim to the\
  \ detailed black and white pattern. Hearing Eskil announce we\u2019d arrived at\
  \ \u201CEl Sombreron Ostrer\xEDa,\u201D the pieces fell into place: the hat, the\
  \ roof, the name. Recognizing my realization, Lazarus\u2019 eyes glistened. \n\n\
  Plastic chairs, narrower than most, were arranged around the structure, their teal\
  \ cushions worn from the weight of hungry travelers. A few sat nestled under an\
  \ umbrella, tempting me with the shade I\u2019d hoped for all morning. And yet,\
  \ while others fled toward cooler temperatures, I found myself remaining in front\
  \ of him and beneath the sun. Instantly drawn to Lazarus\u2019 warmth, I needed\
  \ to watch him work, recognizing this would be more than just a treat for the tastebuds.\
  \ \n\nInto each cup Lazarus dropped a handful of shrimp, on top of which he spooned\
  \ onions, a dollop  of mayonnaise, garlic oil, cocktail sauce, and his \u201Csecret\
  \ ingredient,\u201D a green chimichurri-like spread. Lazarus\u2019 hands moved deftly,\
  \ his enthusiasm increasing with each ingredient added. Grabbing a long spoon he\
  \ started mixing the contents, ensuring each seasoning covered every shrimp. I stood\
  \ transfixed, the heat long forgotten.\n\nAs he stirred, Lazarus regaled us with\
  \ stories that brought me into his world and into his city. Pointing to the Guiness\
  \ World Record sign pasted onto the stall, he explained how he\u2019d produced the\
  \ largest shrimp cocktail ever recorded. Amassing a total of 1,320 kilograms, the\
  \ dish fed 20,000 people, all crowded in front of his shop. Recounting how thousands\
  \ partook in his cocktail, Lazarus\u2019 grin grew, creasing his cheeks and eyes\
  \ until the pride he felt about his achievement had spread across every inch of\
  \ his face.  \n\nHanded the finished product, I took my first taste and my mouth\
  \ jolted awake. Removing the saltine Lazarus provided as an accoutrement, I piled\
  \ both sauce and seafood onto the cracker, savoring each bite. Shutting my eyes,\
  \ I memorized this moment: the combination of sweet and salty, the varied textures\
  \ on my tongue, and the way in which Lazarus\u2019 passion amplified the flavors,\
  \ as though I could taste his love for the craft. \n\nA ringing interrupted this\
  \ feeding frenzy and, reaching into his pocket, Lazarus pulled out a phone so ancient\
  \ my shrimp stuffed mouth fell open. Noting my expression, along with the raised\
  \ eyebrows of Eskil, Lazarus laughingly held it out exclaiming, \u201Ceveryone wants\
  \ to see my iPhone 15.\u201D Quips, it would seem, were as second nature to Lazarus\
  \ as the crafting of shrimp cocktails.\n\nAs the final forkful entered my mouth,\
  \ I paused, realizing that Lazarus had provided me with much more than just a satisfied\
  \ stomach. Sitting here, enjoying food from the sea and stories from a local, I\u2019\
  d finally tasted Cartagena, and Colombia, in more ways than one."
