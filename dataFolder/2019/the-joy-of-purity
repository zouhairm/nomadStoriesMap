Text: "This travel story is my origin story, it is where I entered the story. It was\
  \ a year after the death of my father whose voice was always louder in my mind than\
  \ any other I allowed in, and in trying to deafen it I deafened them all. Costa\
  \ Rica began my quest for silence. \nI set forth on a family vacation to expose\
  \ my children to culture and leave us with stories of rich foods and lavish accommodations\
  \ and found in myself a deep dissatisfaction with the excess in my life. I saw more\
  \ joy in the faces of local women beside a river handwashing their clothes than\
  \ I had ever felt in my upper middle class hamster wheel race. The people I met\
  \ opened my eyes to my own lack of love. I had lost my connection to my children\
  \ and in doing, to my divine feminity.\nMy husband got ill on our trip and instead\
  \ of compassion I showed only intolerance. I literally was willing to have him leave\
  \ alone than \"ruin my vacation\" empathy was lost in me.\nThat trip highlighted\
  \ my disassociation from everything I'd grown to love. I planned that trip with\
  \ the expectation of relaxing and connecting and what I found was a deep separation.\
  \ \nWhat I know now is that I was not ready for what my spirit was seaking. It would\
  \ be another decade before she emerged and set fire to my longheld misbeliefs and\
  \ the demons lose in my soul. I lived in a perpetual state of unrest for ten years\
  \ following Costa Rica, filling the void with anything that could numb the ache\
  \ of it. \nBut there was a moment in Costa Rica I was, briefly, who I wanted to\
  \ be. \nOn a day alone I rode a horse bartered from a neighboring ranch next to\
  \ the villa we rented. My husband and children were on a different planned excursion.\
  \ I rode with my sister until her blisters were unbearable and she turned back.\
  \ I continued, I felt alone and magnificent. I don't remember my horse's name, but\
  \ he trusted me and so did I.  I got him to a gallop in the Pacific surf until I\
  \ came to a rock wall. My calf was bleeding from the stirrups but I had not felt\
  \ it, I did not feel any pain at all. \nThat was when my healing should have started,\
  \ when I realized that I wasn't in any pain.\nI could have continued to believe\
  \ that I was pain free. \nI climbed over the wall and slid into the pool that fell\
  \ from the mountainside into the lapping waves below the rocks. It washed over me,\
  \ it took with it my attachments. I remember the feeling of contentment almost felt\
  \ shameful. In that moment I felt connected, I felt alive and dead at once and had\
  \ I disappeared then I could have gone content, but I do not think my place in this\
  \ world is in contentment, I believe it is in change. Now, now I believe that, then\
  \ I would have disappeared had that option been presented. I floated awhile with\
  \ my ears below the surface and breathed in the connection. When I emerged I was\
  \ only wet, I was not enlightened and I was not any happier. I wanted to be. I pretended\
  \ to be. But I continued to seek outside of myself for the love and healing I was\
  \ slowly dying for. I continued to need the love from my children, I continued to\
  \ need attention from my husband, I continued to need approval from everyone. I\
  \ lost the lessons in the smiles of villagers I captured in my camera. I gave the\
  \ pain of emptiness names like \"migraine\" and \"auto-immune disease\". I put poisons\
  \ into my body and noise into my mind, and men into everything to drive away the\
  \ ache of the emptiness, which only gnawed it deeper. \nI, for too long, pined for\
  \ that place, that experience, that moment in time. I focused on it for so long\
  \ that when I looked up it was 2019 and the ground beneath me shook and now I look\
  \ only forward to continue my story."
