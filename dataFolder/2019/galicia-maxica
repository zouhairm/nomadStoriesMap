Text: "The land of the cloudy sky and the wind, the land of the storm and the apocalyptic\
  \ rain. But also, the land of an eternal green, of ancient traditions and hospitality.\
  \ Galicia is the land of my heart. I close my eyes and I remember each part of Galicia:\
  \ the ocean, the beach, the forest. But most, I remember Galician people: they are\
  \ children of the sea, they are inheritors of Celtic culture and they have an unbreakable\
  \ relationship with their land \u201Cterri\xF1a\u201D.\n\n I remember my first day\
  \ there: from afar, I could hear the bagpipes announcing the \u201CCarnaval\u201D\
  , from close I could smell the salt and fried fish and I could see the Galician\
  \ women dressed up in their typical costumes, ready to dance a \u201Cmui\xF1eira\u201D\
  . \u201CDance with us!\u201D and without realizing, I was dancing an unknown dance\
  \ that gave me life and made me free. That day, I felt like I was one more Galician.\n\
  \n In the darkness of the bar, the waiter appears with a glass where there is a\
  \ liquid: he sets it on fire and then begins a spell in old Galician. When he finished,\
  \ he offered me the drink, queimada: after drunk it, I felt like joy and tranquility\
  \ flood in my heart. \n\nToday, Depor is playing! And, when Depor plays, it's like\
  \ a party: bars open very early and the fans spend here the hours before the match.\
  \ Then, the groups are walking along the Paseo Mar\xEDtimo until they reach the\
  \ Riazor Stadium. During every game, they cheer on the team, regardless the result,\
  \ because the passion of \u201Cla gente marinera\u201D for football overcomes the\
  \ desire for victories.\n\nIt is raining! But people do not take out their umbrellas,\
  \ because the rain is a blessing, the rain clears everything, even the pains of\
  \ the heart and gives an infinite green to Galicia: no matter the season, Galicia\
  \ always impresses with its green.\n\nAt night, the oldest Roman lighthouse, the\
  \ Tower of Hercules, illuminates the city. Under the tower, on a bench, two enamored\
  \ lovers are looking at the stars. Galicia never stops surprising me: the whole\
  \ day it's cloudy, but then, at night, the sky is full of stars!\nIn April it rains\
  \ less, the sun shines more and people spend the whole day at the beach, bathing\
  \ even if the water is cold, but it's a desired bath after a long winter. A bath\
  \ that gives them powers and also a big smile: summer has just arrived! The sunset\
  \ in April is wonderful: first, the sky turns pink and then turns orange. On the\
  \ horizon, the cruise ships continue their journey, while the fishermen are returning\
  \ home. Children are playing with fine sand, dirtying their school uniforms, while\
  \ parents are walking near the ocean. The ocean is very calm today, there are only\
  \  few waves that collide with the rocks and break the silence. \u201CLet's go home,\
  \ it's dinner time!\u201D Suddenly, I can feel the smell of seafood and tortilla.\n\
  \nToday, surfers are lucky: it's a great day to fight with the waves and enjoy the\
  \ feeling of freedom, while people who are walking along the Paseo Mar\xEDtimo stop\
  \ for a few moments to watch them. The bells of the church announce that the Mass\
  \ is over and the priest accompanies the people to the exit. The streets are full;\
  \ in every corner you can see groups and hear a soft murmur. \n\nI'm going to the\
  \ most emblematic monument of this Galician city, the Tower of Hercules, because\
  \ today I want to see the panorama from above. I am the only visitor at this time,\
  \ so the person there does not hesitate to accompany me and tell me stories about\
  \ this magical place. From above, the views take my breath away: anywhere you look,\
  \ the city is surrounded by the ocean. Also, you can see La Rosa del Viento who\
  \ reminds us that the history of the Galician land cannot be forgotten and that\
  \ traditions and language must be maintained and passed on to future generations.\n\
  \nNow, it is time lo leave, !Marcho que te\xF1o que marchar!, but I will return\
  \ because I still have to discover magical places here."
