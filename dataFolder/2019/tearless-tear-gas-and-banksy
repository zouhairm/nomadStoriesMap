Text: "My tired eyes scanned the Tel Aviv airport after an overnight flight from Spain\
  \ to Israel. The Hebrew on the signage coupled with Arabic translations was the\
  \ first sight of the ironic proximity between the warring countries. After being\
  \ roughed up by airport security that patiently conducted a three-hour background\
  \ check on my person, I finally saw the sun as I hunted for transportation to checkpoint\
  \ three-hundred. There, I would cross through Jerusalem, Israel to Bethlehem, Palestine\
  \ alone to get to my hotel. \n\nThe cleanliness of Israel made it look like a holy\
  \ paradise. Jewish men and women donning religious dress while tourists, Palestinians\
  \ and others like myself with curious eyes scurried around the Damascus Gate, where\
  \ my minibus dropped me off. A backpack on my back, a hoodie on my head, and my\
  \ camera in hand, I made confident but cautious strides toward my last bus until\
  \ reaching one of the most famous checkpoints between Israel and Palestine. With\
  \ only a couple hours of sleep in the last day, I stepped off the bus to face checkpoint\
  \ three-hundred. \n\nMostly men at the afternoon hour were passing in and out through\
  \ the checkpoint. I kept my face expressionless as the holy paradise slowly transformed\
  \ into a rougher reality, with an abundance of metal bars, gloomy watch towers,\
  \ and an obsession with tall, grey walls. The view of the sky from the Palestinian\
  \ side of checkpoint three-hundred was married to the towering concrete barriers\
  \ set up by Israel, yet the gray cement was animated with miles of graffiti screaming\
  \ messages of freedom. Of the many pieces of art done on the Israeli wall in Bethlehem,\
  \ there is a piece done by the global renowned English, street artist, Banksy whom\
  \ the Palestinians love and know well. \n\nI searched in exhaustion for my landmark\
  \ hotel, The Walled-Off Hotel by Banksy, a project launched in 2017  that includes\
  \ hotel rooms, a museum and an art gallery all of which are filled with information\
  \ on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. A few wrong turns later and I approached\
  \ the out-of-place, beaming \"Walled-Off Hotel\" sign positioned directly across\
  \ from the Israeli wall. I stared at both the hotel and the wall together in disbelief\
  \ and finally entered the lobby where I was met with original Banksy art work and\
  \ a welcoming staff. \n\nMy days in Palestine and Israel consisted of guided tours\
  \ through refugee camps, holy sites in conflict zones, and strong, yet emotionless\
  \ eyes from Palestinians who shared their stories of displacement. I befriended\
  \ the hotel's tour guide, Marwan, who took me through Aida refugee camp in Bethlehem.\
  \ He pointed at pictures of his friends and neighbors on the walls of the camp who\
  \ had been killed by Israeli soldiers during protests and random shootings. He introduced\
  \ me to his friend Akram who is a famous jeweler in the area that turns tear gas\
  \ bomb shells into beautiful jewelry. \n\n\"Made in America\" is what the bombshells\
  \ read, \"these are made from really good metal,\" Akram explained. \"I started\
  \ collecting the shells after realizing they were good quality material,\" Akram\
  \ said as he slowly rotated the shell in front of me for a better look. When I looked\
  \ in his eyes I saw exhaustion, but when I looked in  his hands I saw shining beautiful\
  \ artwork. I silently began to cry. I could not help but to feel overwhelmed between\
  \ the beauty of his craft and the reality of the situation; life was hard in the\
  \ camp but their eyes showed no weakness and they did not shed a single tear.  \n\
  \nThe endless security checks made me feel trapped in Palestine and in Israel and\
  \ I thought that I would never be able to leave. Even when I was on the plane on\
  \ my way home, I felt like the country was pulling me back. After seeing how people\
  \ lived in Palestine and in Israel, I felt that I had seen something that not many\
  \ people know exist, it was like someone whispered a secret to me that I would take\
  \ with me and share to with the world from that day on."
