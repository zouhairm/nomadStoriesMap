Text: "Is it 3 A.M sharp?  I mean the blanket now stuffed to your chest 3 A.M - sharp?\
  \ It is? Good. Close your eyes. Channel up the flames, darling \u2013 burn down\
  \ the castles. Look at you, listening to the blades of the ceiling fan \u2013 humming,\
  \ buzzing, uh rattling. Sshh, I\u2019m here, watching. What a turmoil you\u2019\
  ve been wrestling against \u2013 I sense an inferno around you. It looks like light,\
  \ gives burns like fire \u2013 the kind that chooses to burn you down \u2013 ashes,\
  \ ember, soot - then chooses to bring you back \u2013 skin, muscle, bone. Flakes\
  \ of us burn at dusk, of ashes we collect in daylight. A cycle of piercing back\
  \ to the immaterial, the irrelevant. Have you tried breaking through? From the purgatory\
  \ that your 9-5 job is or perhaps from the misery that your last heart break had\
  \ brought? I\u2019ll tell you what it takes to put off the fire of your inferno\
  \ sweetie\u2013 we\u2019re about to take a leap into the unknown.\n\n \u201CYou\
  \ ride bike? It rain today. It dangerous.\u201D It was obvious he was having trouble\
  \ speaking English \u2013 a man - aged somewhere around fifty  with a wrinkled face,\
  \ parched lips and a sunburned forehead told me not to rent a bicycle on a rainy\
  \ day. But it was my first and only day in Interlaken, Switzerland \u2013 and when\
  \ there\u2019s only one chance for you to do it \u2013 do it. \u201CHere\u2019s\
  \ your Euros Sir, I\u2019ll be back \u2013 dead or alive.\u201D I laughed it off\
  \ as I sped into the next lane. Of course I didn\u2019t know which way to go. That\u2019\
  s the best part about travelling \u2013 wander off until you\u2019re lost \u2013\
  \ find your way back \u2013 then lose yourself again. About fifteen minutes in,\
  \ it started raining. Now was the time to... go home? For a traveller, maybe \u2013\
  \ for a wanderer, are you kidding me? Watching the mountains from afar, the only\
  \ thing I wanted was to reach them and the clouds that touched them, talked to them\
  \ \u2013 you know \u2013 like a child who\u2019s always wanted to reach the stars\
  \ - pointing out to the brightest star at a murky night telling his friends he\u2019\
  s going to go up there someday  and witness, well - magic. I followed the mountains\
  \ \u2013 lane by lane \u2013 the closer and closer they got \u2013 the farther I\
  \ felt, from myself \u2013 from shutout emotions, material captivity, the pulsating\
  \ insanity. Rattle, squeak \u2013 the bike had stopped and there I was, on the road\
  \ with not a single form of life around me, grassland on one side - mountain on\
  \ the other. I\u2019d fell. Too occupied with the scarred knee, I panicked \u2013\
  \ it was getting dark and now I couldn\u2019t walk properly. The bike\u2019s paddle\
  \ wasn\u2019t moving, thank god it didn\u2019t. I saw a log house at the corner\
  \ of the grassland and decided to walk to it in hopes someone lived there and would\
  \ help. \n\u201CHello, is anyone there?\u201D I walked in only to find out just\
  \ another door at the other end of the log house. It wasn\u2019t just a door to\
  \ the log house though \u2013 it was a door to... divination?  A lake gushed through,\
  \ right below my feet,  with a mountain right across \u2013 the rain hadn\u2019\
  t stopped - a rainbow peeked through the mountain. I could hear some bird chirping,\
  \ their melodies mixed with the sound of thunder though. Tears rushed down. There\
  \ was everything for me to witness \u2013 there was nothing I could see.  Have you\
  \ ever felt that way darling, you know like rain on an infertile desert being reduced\
  \ to nothing \u2013yet being exalted up to everything, have you ever felt the breeze\
  \ reaching out \u2013 telling you everything is okay, everything will be okay. That\
  \ is exactly what it takes to burn the infernos of your heart sweetie. \nNow come\
  \ along, shh, channel up the flames, darling \u2013 burn down the castles \u2013\
  \ is it your time to witness a leap... into the unknown?"
