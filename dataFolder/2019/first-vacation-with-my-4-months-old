Text: "It was October and the season of Autumn as I was taking a stroll with my 4\
  \ months old son in the park, I realized he enjoys being out in the open, he admires\
  \ the nature by just pointing fingers on birds, swings, etc., and suddenly I thought\
  \ maybe it\u2019s time for his first vacation.\n\nAs soon as I went back home, I\
  \ started looking for places. After few hours I thought of the beautiful \u201C\
  Kashmir\u201D. I immediately called my husband to tell him about the plan that I\
  \ just made. After he came home, he was like are you sure about Kashmir being cold\
  \ and snowy, do you really want to take him at this age, isn\u2019t he too small\
  \ for the weather there. My response was let\u2019s make his first vacation memorable\
  \ with snowfall. I mean of course he will not remember a thing but he will have\
  \ pictures to see.\n\n3 weeks after, we landed in the beautiful Srinagar for a 6\
  \ days\u2019 vacation. Srinagar is the largest city and the summer capital of the\
  \ Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. It lies in the most picturesque Kashmir valley.\
  \ Being extremely beautiful the area unfortunately continues to be highly politicized\
  \ with frequent spontaneous protests and strikes. As a result, bunkers and checkpoints\
  \ are found throughout the city.\n\nMostly, it is extremely risky to visit the city\
  \ but you will always find tourist visiting Srinagar. The city is located on both\
  \ sides of the Jhelum River which passes through the city and meanders through the\
  \ valley, moving onward and deepening in the \u201CDal Lake\u201D. Dal Lake which\
  \ is famous for its beautiful houseboats and is no less than a 5-star hotel and\
  \ I personally recommend to choose a houseboat over the hotel as it will give a\
  \ completely different and fulfilling experience. Make sure to go for the \u201C\
  Shikara\u201D ride in the Dal Lake to experience the floating market, floating post\
  \ office and the fountain. \n\nWhen in Srinagar definitely visit Gulmarg \u2013\
  \ \u201CMeadow of Flowers\u201D. Gulmarg lies in a cup shaped valley in the Pir\
  \ Panjal Range of the Himalayas. Experiencing the beautiful two stage Gondola in\
  \ Gulmarg which is one of the world\u2019s highest operating cable cars was absolutely\
  \ fascinating and my munchkin\u2019s expression while on the Gondola was just priceless.\n\
  \nOn top of our list was extremely beautiful hill station known as Sonmarg \u2013\
  \ \u201CMeadow of Gold\u201D. In its vicinity lies the great Himalayan glaciers.\
  \ It is inaccessible during winter due to heavy snowfall and avalanches. Situated\
  \ in close proximity to Zojila Pass that connects Ladakh with the Valley of Kashmir,\
  \ is an ideal place for those who have profound love for nature and enjoys solitude.\
  \ It\u2019s a perfect location for setting up base camps before resuming your trekking\
  \ expeditions. An epitome of beauty, Sonmarg is the true reflection of the valley\
  \ of Kashmir.\n\nThere are a lot of major attractions in Sonmarg however, we decided\
  \ to visit Thajiwas Glacier as it is the most easily accessible glacier in the region.\
  \ Yes, I had a 4-month-old with me so didn\u2019t wanted to be too adventurous.\
  \ Thajiwas Glacier exemplifies the charm of Sonmarg, a ride up the hill on ponies\
  \ or a leisure walk with its intrinsic natural beauty and exceptional vistas. On\
  \ the way to the glacier, you get to witness the beauty of the shining frozen lake\
  \ along with all the greenery around. \n\nNext on the list was this beautiful town\
  \ known as \u201CPahalgam\u201D which is also known as \u201CMini Switzerland\u201D\
  . Its lush green meadows and pristine waters attract thousands of tourists from\
  \ all over the world. Getting around Pahalgam is mostly done by walking and on Ponies.\
  \ The area holds a rich cover of vegetation. Due to the constant threat of illegal\
  \ border crossing because of the thick forest, the Indian Army is always patrolling\
  \ the area and is on constant high alert.\n\nThis vacation definitely refreshed\
  \ all of us but somewhere down the line, it makes me extremely unhappy to see the\
  \ condition of the people living there in terror all the time and our brave Indian\
  \ Army guarding the borders to keep us safe. Left me with one question \u2013 When\
  \ will this all end?"
