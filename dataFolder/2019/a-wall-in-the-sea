Text: "It was hot that day in the village. Molly woke up earlier than the others ,it\
  \ was her  first day  holiday and also her first time in Italy. She dreamed a lot\
  \ about that trip probably the last one with all her  family  before the start of\
  \ her first university year and that morning exactly at 8.00 am she was  the only\
  \ one awake  and too curious to remain  indoor waiting her brothers and parents\
  \ to wake  up , so without too much reflection  while the others were sleeping she\
  \ silently  wore  a bikini and some shorts and decided to go out for a swim. \u201C\
  The sea should not be far \u201Cshe taught considering the fact she saw it   the\
  \ night before  while arriving from the airport . From the car the distance hadn\u2019\
  t  seem so long and altought she hadn\u2019t have ever seen a  a Lampedusa map and\
  \ she didn\u2019t know any beach name of  the island  she started to walk. \nAfter\
  \ ten minutes walking trough a countryside road the small house on the hill was\
  \ disappearead , instead the sea appeared in front of her, it was only 8 30 but\
  \  the sun was already disturbing so  she changed the side of the street to walk\
  \ under the threes shadow. She was angry she didn\u2019t eat nothing before leaving\
  \ for the beach and she started wondering if there was some shops on the way. But\
  \ while wondering suddenly she realized she was arrived, exactly in the  smallest\
  \ beach of Lampedusa.  The beauty of the landscape was unbelivable white sand and\
  \ light blue  all around, there weren\u2019t  many people, and just few meters away\
  \ she realized a coffee place was opened  and she choosed to walked in that direction.\
  \ She entered in the bar, a couple and two men\u2019s were taking a coffeee standing\
  \ at the bar they were speaking  loud  and the sound of that Sicilian dialect appeared\
  \ to her like a song itself  that land appeared so welcoming and warm she couldn\u2019\
  t believe she was there in Italy. Ready for one entire  month holiday after that\
  \ long trip. She grabbed a \u201Ccornetto\u201D and a cappuccino she said grazie\
  \ and paid with 10 euro she had in her pocket she still had them from her previous\
  \ trip to France and then she went  out  from the wood bar on the beach and she\
  \ sit on sand to do her breakfast.  There were around 6 people in the beach and\
  \ it was All so silent. \nIt was the perfect moment for a swim, she undressed herself\
  \ and she jumped in the sea the temperature was perfect and she started to swim\
  \ , the feeling of the water in her skin was so refreshing. But at the some point\
  \ she felt something touched her knees. It was a glass bottle and as every \u201C\
  sea bottle\u201D has some paper inside it. \nShe couldn\u2019t believe she had found\
  \ a sea bottle she took it and came back to the beach. She didn\u2019t want to wait\
  \ and with some efforts  she managed to open the bottle  and take off the paper.\
  \ She opened it and inside it was written\u201D dear Molly we\u2019re  you\u2019\
  re parents  Amina and Abdulla we are in the sea  now we\u2019re travelling since\
  \ five days we don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll survive the trip , from Africa is hard\
  \ and it seems the wind is not helping the boat to reach the coast but we know you\u2019\
  re safe in Lampedusa  and that the Italian gouvernement accepted you and that you\u2019\
  re currently living with an Italian family, that is volunteering for the red crops\
  \ project that accept  young Africans emigrated in the country. This is our last\
  \ message we received all your lettter home , and if  you   will ever read it we\
  \ want you to know we love you and this wall in the sea will not prevent us to protect\
  \ you from the sky or from everywhere else  we will be \u201C Driiin Driiin the\
  \ alarm clock sound broke Molly sleep that morning,  she suddenly wake up the temperature\
  \ in the room was hot and she didn\u2019t understand if that was a nightmare or\
  \ a dream."
