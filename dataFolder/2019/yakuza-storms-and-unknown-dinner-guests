Text: "A car finally pulled over in this dreadful thunderstorm. An ex-convict and\
  \ his barefoot wife stepped out to save two sopping wet hitchhikers with a barely\
  \ legible sign for the town \"Mashike, Hokkaido\". Without taking a real look at\
  \ the driver and his companion, we began piling our soaked backpacks into their\
  \ trunk.\n \nI usually leave this part out when recounting my travels in Japan at\
  \ the dinner table. My mother might suffer an aneurysm if she found out I hitchhiked\
  \ at all, let alone did so with a former yakuza. Where I\u2019m from, hitchhiking\
  \ is taboo. Several high-profile serial killer cases in the 90s, plus countless\
  \ disappearing girls along Canada\u2019s Highway of Tears, made sure the taboo stuck.\
  \ But jobless and three months into my journey through Hokkaido, my North American\
  \ nightmares were a world away and this mode of transport was the perfect blend\
  \ of frugality and adventure. Equipped with naive optimism, half-melted cardboard,\
  \ and a decent insurance package, we were convinced nothing could go wrong.\n \n\
  Still barefoot, the driver\u2019s wife ran into the rest stop and a moment later\
  \ reappeared with two hot coffees, promotional towels for a local minor league baseball\
  \ team and skewers of soy-dipped dango. They laid out the towels in the back, and\
  \ assured me that the small sponges formerly known as my shoes were \u201Cperfectly\
  \ alright\u201D in their pristine SUV. I wiped off the stupid salty Hokkaido rain\
  \ in my eye.\n \nOur saviour turned out to be a couple from Rumoi: home of the best\
  \ herring roe, a coastal town just 16 kilometres north of our destination. Their\
  \ town mascot is a large, neon-yellow slab of roe with long, flirty eyelashes. We\
  \ thanked them repeatedly in broken Japanese, but our beaming smiles were enough\
  \ to show them how much we meant each mispronounced word. \u201CFate,\u201D exclaimed\
  \ our driver, Mr. Sasaki. His wife showed us pictures of herself barefoot in ice\
  \ and snow, while Mr. Sasaki smiled gleefully and asked if we enjoyed our Japanese\
  \ desserts. He proudly told us he will visit America one day when his son gets drafted\
  \ to play college baseball. Neither of them had left Japan before, so out of kindness\
  \ and immense curiosity they wanted to give the two tragic-looking foreigners a\
  \ ride. Even though the west coast of Hokkaido is textbook sublime and an abundant\
  \ source of world class seafood, it is mostly frequented by Japanese tourists and\
  \ a few cycling enthusiasts who have done their homework. Mashike just wasn\u2019\
  t the type of sleepy town to get foreign tourists, let alone doughy Canadian hitchhikers\
  \ like us. Before we knew it, we were somehow invited to the Sasaki household for\
  \ dinner the next day.\n \nFive kids, a golden retriever and a mountain of yakitori\
  \ skewers, takoyaki and fried noodles, the Sasaki home was a fine balance between\
  \ chaos and cozy. The younger children peered behind corners as their parents handed\
  \ their precious wine made from the plums in the Hokkaido Shrine to their strange\
  \ Tuesday night dinner guests. The two teens mustered the courage to ask if we would\
  \ like wasabi on the fresh octopus sashimi their dad was slicing in the kitchen.\
  \ \u201CYes, please,\u201D we answered in Japanese. The Sasakis darted glances of\
  \ approval, joyous to find the foreigners enjoyed the slippery, divine chew of a\
  \ raw octopus as much as they do.\n \nMr. Sasaki came out of the kitchen with a\
  \ beautifully arranged plate of octopus. In between bites, he told us about life\
  \ before their suburban bliss. All I could catch was \u201Cchef\u201D and \u201C\
  yakuza\u201D, the word for Japanese mafia. Now I had more questions than ever. Was\
  \ he a chef for the yakuza or a chef turned yakuza? We later found out that our\
  \ host was incarcerated twice before finding comfort in his quiet family life of\
  \ running a cleaning service and trading cryptocurrency. In between bites of home\
  \ cooked deliciousness and sips of priceless plum wine, we fell into a warm, comfortable\
  \ slumber. Never quite knowing why the lady never wears shoes or how Mr. Sasaki\
  \ got into cleaning and crypto, they tucked us into their oldest son\u2019s bedroom\
  \ and bid us good night."
