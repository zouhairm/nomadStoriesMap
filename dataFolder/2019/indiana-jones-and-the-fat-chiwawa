Text: "It all started with a jeep, two strangers and 5 days of travel. I left the\
  \ comforts of my single bed in London to sleep in a borrowed hammock in the forests\
  \ of Costa Rica, joining a man I\u2019d just met from an Airbnb ad on a 5-day hike.\
  \ There\u2019s a lot of worries for the parents of incredibly independent children,\
  \ my mums, however, was highly irrational. She didn\u2019t fear me being bitten\
  \ by a Fur De Lance or drowning in the Pacific, instead, it was the unlicensed guide\
  \ I\u2019d employed that furrowed her brow. Now I know she had reason to be worried,\
  \ but I figured my Spanish was good enough to shout for help, had something gone\
  \ wrong. I had a broken phone, $15 I\u2019d borrowed from a student I\u2019d been\
  \ working with at an animal rescue centre and 20 days\u2019 worth of sweat lined,\
  \ hole filled, and mud-crusted clothing within an overpriced 70L backpack. I was\
  \ the epitome of a solo traveller, with all the clich\xE9s included. I met, Javier,\
  \ my tour guide, who greeted me with a beep outside the arrivals of Juan Santamaria\
  \ International Airport. The first thing that struck me was his hat, either he was\
  \ cosplaying as a young Indiana Jones or he was hiding a receding hairline, spoiler\
  \ - it was the latter. After overcoming the awkward silence that filled the 4x4,\
  \ I decided to joke about him possibly using Airbnb to plan the perfect murder,\
  \ alas he was vegetarian and that was reason enough for me to trust him. After all,\
  \ how many vegetarian serial killers have you heard of? The anthem of the trip was\
  \ notoriously \u2018keep the car running\u2019 by Arcade fire and I\u2019m not sure\
  \ if it was because Javier enjoyed the song, or if he thought serenading the car\
  \ might help it last an extra 50 miles. I never had the nerve to ask. Our last stop\
  \ was at a lonely bar house in Guanacaste, the exact location I\u2019m still unsure\
  \ of. We came intending to visit a river with three distinct layers of blue pigment\
  \ and sleep in the trees surrounding the bar. However, Javier hoisted up the light\
  \ green cotton hammocks onto what he believed to be a strong Cedro tree, shushing\
  \ my worries about its ability to hold him with a quick \u201Ces Fuerte\u201D, only\
  \ to fall, bringing down a tree faster than any logger I\u2019d ever seen. Paulo,\
  \ a middle-aged, blue-eyed man with three daughters and a fat chiwawa called Pino,\
  \ witnessed the event commenting on Javier\u2019s pseudo-macho attitude as the scream\
  \ that left his lips only seconds reverberated into the mountains. Generosity, whether\
  \ from witnessing a fall more dramatized than a BBC crime thriller or possibly from\
  \ my gaping mouth at the realisation I\u2019d have to climb into a hammock myself,\
  \ led to Paulo asking us to stay with him. His condition was that we join the celebrations,\
  \ which I later found out was the Annexation of Guanacaste day. After getting comfortable\
  \ on Paulo\u2019s kitchen floor, with our sleeping bags, pillows converted from\
  \ hiking bags and some new acquaintances in the form of glass spiders that had taken\
  \ up roost under the kitchen sink, we joined Paulo in picking up supplies. The local\
  \ shop was a fifteen-minute drive with the main commerce being sugar and rice. Costa\
  \ Rica in the previous three weeks of travelling had not given me such an overwhelming\
  \ feeling of isolation or disconnection from the outside world, I felt like an extra\
  \ in a Jurassic Park sequel. Upon our return, the horizon of the bar was lit, highlighting\
  \ a parade of children with drums followed by horses and cows who were more decadent\
  \ than the attendees of the last royal wedding, through local streets littered with\
  \ oranges and sapote. I was in an unknown location, with unknown people, eating\
  \ unknown potato soup. I confronted my apprehension, with a sour pilsner and very\
  \ poor cha cha. This isn\u2019t an advert for pilsner, I can promise that but, I\u2019\
  m sure there\u2019s nothing music and food couldn\u2019t fix, including our presumptions\
  \ of the unknown. Javier was most definitely not a serial killer, just very bad\
  \ at pitching hammocks."
