Text: "High mountains and a wonderful sea, in summer's sunny days which makes breathing\
  \ deep and quiet. The mysterious island of Corsica is a time temple blessedly preserved.\
  \ Here history and culture do not belong to the past but to the present.\_\nSurprising\
  \ prehistorical places like Filitosa or Funtanaccia with their enigmatic dolmens\
  \ that makes our imagination look for that old and primitive man just hidden behind\
  \ a stone or a tree.\nNear the city of Aleria we can find indelible traces of many\
  \ people: Greeks, Etruscans, Carthaginians, Romans that can be rediscovered in an\
  \ impeccable museum and an astonishing archaeological site full of contemporary\
  \ sculptures of ancient myths. Today it is still possible to transit by roads and\
  \ enjoy thermal baths, like Rose of Caldane, constructed by the Romans.\nLonely\
  \ round stone towers built by pirates, isolated on distant peninsulas, cities and\
  \ castles surrounded by high defensive battlements, enchanted medieval citadels\
  \ like\_Bonifacio and Porto Vecchio, that surprise us at every moment, are true\
  \ living memories of the Middle Ages.\nAjaccio, Napoleon Bonaparte's birthplace\
  \ and a charming summer resort is also renowned for its museum of fine Arts, with\
  \ intense cultural life and  at the same time a place of traditional typical regional\
  \ product fairs on weekends.\nInside this precious island, mountains ranges to lose\
  \ sight  of  with hanging small towns, like wild goats, in abrupt rock's faces.\
  \ For a moment I felt myself hovering over the sky.\nThousands of years of history\
  \ to tell, wonderful boat trips along the coast, so beautiful sandy beaches with\
  \ crystal  blue waters, challenging rocky mountains, unforgettable sunsets have\
  \ made me leave this island with the same feeling of the seagull that flies, lonely,\
  \ at the moon rise over deserts oceans ... Visit Corsica."
