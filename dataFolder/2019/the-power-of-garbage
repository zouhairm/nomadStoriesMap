Text: "A traveler. A woman. A bike-rider. A worker in overalls. A garbage collector.\
  \ A bicycle trailer user. An activist. A white European.\n\nI was all of the above\
  \ at the same time in Kuseibmond, Walvis Bay\u2019s black neighborhood. I was alone,\
  \ out of my comfort zone, collecting garbage in the street for recycling using a\
  \ bicycle with a trailer. No, I definitely could not just blend in. \n\nI was helping\
  \ an NGO conduct an experiment. They wanted to know if someone could make a living\
  \ by working full-time as a recyclable waste collector. It turned out difficult\
  \ to find someone willing to test it out, so I offered to do it myself. Since Kuseibmond\
  \ had a lot of garbage lying around, it proved to be Walvis Bay\u2019s best area\
  \ for collection. \n\nNamibia\u2019s precious, finally obtained after four years\
  \ of protests, Walvis Bay was the last city to have joined independent Namibia.\
  \ It is, after all, the biggest port in the country, no wonder South Africa wanted\
  \ it so bad. Walvis Bay became a part of Namibia in 1994, the same year that the\
  \ apartheid system was abolished, the same year when segregation ended. Or did it\
  \ really?\n\nMonika, the 22-year-old student who was kind enough to offer half of\
  \ her bed to me for two whole weeks, was also living in Kuseibmond. You\u2019d have\
  \ to walk about an hour to get from Monika\u2019s place to the main public library.\
  \ \n\nWe both loved the library. The large green tidy lawn in front of the public\
  \ library reminded me of home. The dark brown wooden shelves covered with old books,\
  \ the silence, the wooden tables, the light, they all teleported us in a better\
  \ world, a world very different from chaotic Kuseibmond. The library was in the\
  \ nice part of the city, not far away from the city center, close to the coast,\
  \ surrounded by tall, freshly-painted houses with large yards. There was barely\
  \ anyone in the streets, most people were driving. This was the white area.\n\n\
  The dusty roads full of holes, the poky houses, the lack of green spaces, the messiness,\
  \ the noise, the crowds from Kuseibmond seemed to be thousands of miles away and\
  \ decades behind by comparison to the area around the library. But it was just a\
  \ one-hour walk or a 20 minutes bike ride. Kuseibmond was the black area.\n\nAfter\
  \ my first day of collecting garbage, I was informed that everyone in Kuseibmond\
  \ knew me. I was \u201Cthe white lady on a bike with garbage\u201D. After a few\
  \ days, kids were offering to help me clean up the football field, men wanted to\
  \ try out the bike to see how heavy the trailer was, women were asking where I was\
  \ going and what I was doing with the garbage, business owners offered to collect\
  \ plastics, glass, aluminum and cardboard separately to make my job easier. Everyone\
  \ was smiling.\n\nI met Monika through a homestay platform where she was expressing\
  \ her enthusiasm for traveling and discovering new cultures. I was excited to get\
  \ to know her. I was hoping she would become my bridge with the local culture. Getting\
  \ to know her, was my chance of blending in in a society very different from mine.\
  \ \n\nMonika could speak Owambo, Afrikaans, English, and German, but she could not\
  \ ride a bike. Her parents did not afford to buy a bike for her when she was a kid,\
  \ so she had never learned. She was walking every day to the library, the internet\
  \ was relatively fast and free there. She was looking for a summer job. \n\nIt was\
  \ very easy to make friends with Monika. We were soon cooking together, organizing\
  \ weekend day trips together, riding together on my bike, I even taught her how\
  \ to ride a bike. \n\nBut funnily enough, she was not my bridge with the local culture.\
  \ She was not the reason why I finally felt I was blending in. It was garbage. Garbage\
  \ helped me connect with people I had never thought I could connect. Garbage made\
  \ the segregation disappear. I wasn\u2019t \u201Cthe white lady on a bike with garbage\u201D\
  \ anymore. I was simply Irina now and that made all the difference."
