Text: "\u201CWe\u2019re lost, aren\u2019t we?\u201D my partially rhetorical question\
  \ was met with grim silence from both of my friends walking ahead of me, somewhere\
  \ in the forests of Germany.\nOur day had begun with the plan of taking a day trip\
  \ to visit the castle made up of all our childhood dreams. The Neuschwanstein Castle,\
  \ that inspired the design of Disney\u2019s logo, had been on top of our wish list\
  \ of places to visit while on our student exchange in Stuttgart, from the very beginning.\
  \ The castle, as I\u2019d always seen in the pictures, sat dreamily in the center\
  \ of densely filled masses of greens. Little did we know of what awaited us right\
  \ amid these forests. \nWhile we\u2019d barely recovered from the sheer joy of visiting\
  \ the castle, we realized that we had just enough time to accommodate an experience\
  \ of witnessing the Lechfall in F\xFCssen. \n\nThe leaves wet with freshly fallen\
  \ snow were slowly losing its crunch. I could feel the narrow path we were walking\
  \ on, getting exceedingly slippery. I felt the wetness seeping in through my feet\
  \ and my poor choice of footwear only then hit me. My UGGs weren\u2019t made to\
  \ endure the snow. The endless hike was slowly making us aware of the grave miscalculated\
  \ error we\u2019d made.\n\nI could smell the pine in the air, but it was mixed with\
  \ the gruesome smell of our combined fear. The trees surrounding us seemed hauntingly\
  \ tall as the sun was dipping in the horizon, shrouding us all in their shadows.\
  \ The biting cold that seemed to be getting icier by every passing moment was making\
  \ us really question the decision of choosing to visit this less explored jewel.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t control the overwhelming feeling of wanting to be at home, back\
  \ in India, where right around this time Ma would be serving us supper that she\u2019\
  d have lovingly prepared with the entire family gathered around the table for a\
  \ night filled with good food and conversations. Never had I ever lived away from\
  \ home, away from the protectiveness, away from the love. The poor connection on\
  \ my phone wasn\u2019t the only reason why I didn\u2019t want to make a call home;\
  \ I was afraid they\u2019d be terrified for my situation and drive themselves sick\
  \ with worry.\n\nAfter what felt like hours of hiking, we were slowly starting to\
  \ lose hope of finding any way out. However, my growling stomach brought me back\
  \ to the present.\n\nI could try to describe the feeling of seeing another human\
  \ being other than the two accompanying me, but I cannot. She was walking her dog,\
  \ a schnauzer, whose ears perked up at feeling our presence. \n\n\u201CEntschuldigung!\
  \ Wir brauchen Hilfe\u201D it is then when all the time and attention spent in my\
  \ German language classes seemed to have paid off as I was able to ask for help\
  \ in my state of stupor. \n\nIn the chilling cold, her warm smile and an invite\
  \ to her vacation home close-by, made me feel all warm and giddy inside. I witnessed\
  \ the forest changing right before my eyes. The same biting cold was not so frosty\
  \ anymore; the very same haunting trees now felt like the guides to a safe haven.\
  \ I heard my friend voicing her wish to bottle up the petrichor, however, I couldn\u2019\
  t stop desperately wanting to bottle up this strong feeling of hope and gratefulness\
  \ to treasure it forever.\n\nOver steaming cups of Milch Kaffe, Saskia promised\
  \ to drive us to the bus stop. Amongst all the coconut and peach theories in the\
  \ world, I found my theory of humane. \nI realized that getting lost was essential\
  \ to finding what we did."
