Text: "Thrust out of my New York City comfort zone and into the complete unknown,\
  \ I find myself in San Ramon, Costa Rica as part of an outreach program. Surrounded\
  \ by an international, diverse collection of volunteers, I'm engaging in some of\
  \ the most challenging physical work of my adult life.\_\n\nThe house we are building\
  \ in San Ramon is for a small family of three, and we're starting from the ground\
  \ up.\_ Every day we take a forty minute bus ride to a piece of land nestled in\
  \ a hill within the sprawling green dips of La Paz, the Central Valley region.\_\
  \ We began at the beginning - just a flat dirt area roped off - and the initial\
  \ work encompasses\_everything from digging trenches to making and pouring concrete.\
  \ \_We form assembly lines to move piles of breeze blocks and wheelbarrow pounds\
  \ and pounds of sand, rocks, concrete, and dirt. \_Most days I come home covered\
  \ in dust, dried cement, bruises from dropped breeze blocks, and a variety of bug\
  \ bites, all caked under layers of sweat from working under a blistering sun.\_\n\
  \_\nThe family - Walter, Lindsay, and their little girl Abigail - are on site every\
  \ day, along with Walter\u2019s brother-in-law and a fellow worker. From both an\
  \ emotional and logistical standpoint, it\u2019s crazy to think this family will\
  \ be living in something I helped build. \n\nOur daily diet consists of carbs with\
  \ carbs.\_Rice and beans are a staple at every lunch and dinner, paired\_with anything\
  \ from meat to pasta.\_One night I was served a monochromatic palette of beige on\
  \ beige - boiled potatoes with white rice. \_\n\nI\u2019m humbled by the simple,\
  \ pleasant attitude and diligent work ethic on site.\_These men toil day and night,\
  \ without so much as a complaint or a frown appearing on their gentle faces.\_My\
  \ fellow volunteers are a fascinating group, coming from all over the world at all\
  \ different stages in life, all drawn here for their own reason - strangers who\
  \ became a family overnight. \n\nOn a Friday afternoon we board a bus from San Ramon\
  \ to Manuel Antonio for some relaxing beach time after a week of intense labor.\_\
  The house now has all of its walls up, the frames for the windows have been built,\
  \ and the preparation for the roof is in place, with my only casualties being more\
  \ mosquito bites and a fifteen pound breeze block cracking on my thigh. In just\
  \ two weeks time, on this simple\_piece of land, sits a home.\_ We can walk through\
  \ doorways and peer out windows, enjoying the breathtaking view that Walter and\
  \ his family will wake up to every morning.\n\nOn the bus journey down to Manuel\
  \ Antonio an older Costa Rican woman takes a seat next to me.\_ She appears to be\
  \ about sixty, with kind eyes, weathered skin, and a smile that reveals crooked,\
  \ missing teeth.\_To my surprise, she attempts\_to speak English with me.\_Unlike\
  \ Europeans, most of the Costa Rican people are quite comfortable with their native\
  \ language and speak/understand little English.\_ The woman tells me she lived in\
  \ New Jersey for a year where she worked at Wendy\xB4s and her daughter worked at\
  \ ShopRite.\_ \n\n\u201CSo nice and so beautiful!\u201D she exclaims. \n\nShe speaks\
  \ of her family, her grandchildren, and her house in San Ramon, and ask me what\
  \ brought me to Costa Rica.\_ I tell her about the building project and her warm\
  \ eyes light up. She blesses me and my fellow volunteers, states how much she loves\
  \ Americans, loves English, and loves me.\_The child-like appreciation she has for\
  \ life reminds me of why I came to Costa Rica in the first place.\n\nI wish I could\
  \ be here the day Walter, Lindsay and Abigail move in to their \u201Ccastle\u201D\
  \ on the hill.\_ We had a good laugh the other day when we asked one of the workers\
  \ what Walter\xB4s address will be and he responded (in Spanish), \u201CWalter\xB4\
  s House, 100 KM east of the church, La Paz, San Ramon, Alajuela, Costa Rica.\u201D\
  \n\nI have a feeling my Christmas card won\xB4t be getting there, but a piece of\
  \ me will always remain on that hill."
