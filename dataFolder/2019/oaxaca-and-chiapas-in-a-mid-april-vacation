Text: "It was mid-April, the air was dry and warm, and the sun was shining brightly\
  \ in the south of Mexico, in Oaxaca. I had been living in Mexico since January of\
  \ that year, marveling at every discovery I had made so far about local culture\
  \ and cuisine. A group of friends and I decided to start our vacation from there.\
  \ Oaxaca is known by the indigenous tradition and the natural landscapes. The capital,\
  \ also named Oaxaca, is marked by historical buildings from the period of Spanish\
  \ colonization, each brick seems to tell a story. The central square, the Zocalo\
  \ Oaxaca, is of simple beauty, a protruding church, in a square with robust and\
  \ green trees, and that at night receive a special illumination that makes the atmosphere\
  \ even more festive. The next day I went to Hierve el Agua, a rocky formation of\
  \ minerals that created small natural pools, about 70km from Oaxaca. To get there,\
  \ it was necessary to travel in vehicles adapted for collective transportation.\
  \ The road swinging was felt every kilometer, but the company and the landscape\
  \ made the route a little more pleasant.\nAfter enjoying the beauties of the central\
  \ region of Oaxaca, we set off to the coast, arriving in Mazunte. I was surprised\
  \ by the powerful waves that were breaking on that small beach, almost paradisiac\
  \ and little explored, with streets of simple ground and restaurants to the seaside.\
  \ Sleeping and waking up listening to the rough ocean of the Pacific Ocean remains\
  \ one of the most beloved memories of this trip. I also bring with me some scars\
  \ from the adventures as I confronted these same waves which, at about 6 o'clock\
  \ in the afternoon, became strong Zapotec and Mixtec warriors.\nPuerto Escondido\
  \ was the next destination. The city is already busier than the quiet Mazunte, certainly\
  \ for the fame among surfers looking for the \u2018unpacific\u2019 waves of the\
  \ Pacific. The beauty of the beach is undeniable: translucent blue water and white\
  \ sand, accompanied by rocks where waves crash and large and imposing trees. Unlike\
  \ surfers, Puerto Escondido was the time for us to relax in the shade of a big tree.\n\
  Other famous beaches of Oaxaca are the Bahias de Huatulco, a set of 8 beaches that\
  \ can be visited in a single boat trip. The intention was to spend the day stopping\
  \ at each of the beaches. The food of our lunch was more expensive than planned,\
  \ apparently Huatulco is already part of the tourism business. Anyway, the food\
  \ was tasty, it is not for less that Mexican food is Intangible Cultural Heritage\
  \ of Humanity.\nWe decided to make our trip by land transportation, which takes\
  \ us to a long trip to San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. Like Oaxaca, the historic\
  \ Spanish colonization has left its mark on the city's architecture, which transports\
  \ us back into the past with ease and charm. In the central streets of the city,\
  \ there are a variety of handicraft shops and cafes. Particularly, I am a fan of\
  \ handicrafts and I had to control my desire to take San Crist\xF3bal de las Casas\
  \ inside my suitcase. The Guadalupe Church can be seen at the top of a hill, to\
  \ reach it, there are 79 steps that allow an incredible view of the region. In fact,\
  \ the churches of the city are beautiful.\nOur group took the opportunity to visit\
  \ el Chiflon, a national park cut by the San Vicente River and its beautiful waterfalls,\
  \ among them the Vielo de Novia, approximately 120 meters high. The turquoise color\
  \ of the waters falling in the middle of the forest made the place one of the most\
  \ beautiful I have ever seen, as well as wild animals that can be seen while walking\
  \ through the park. We still visited the Lakes of Montebello, on the border with\
  \ Guatemala. Despite the warm weather, the water in the lakes was still icy. Just\
  \ as I dove into the lake, I can say that this trip was a leap into the unknown.\
  \ A Mexico that I did not know and that today is a happy part of my history, a destination\
  \ that never left my list of places to revisit."
