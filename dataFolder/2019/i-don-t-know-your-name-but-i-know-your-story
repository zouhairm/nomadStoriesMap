Text: "I've always been fascinated with London. I remember my 2nd grade English book,\
  \ filled with stereotypical pictures of pie and custard, Big Ben and Tower Bridge,\
  \ and for as long as I can remember I've dreamed of visiting the city. I finally\
  \ managed to do it in 2016. It was my second trip abroad by myself, I was way out\
  \ of my comfort zone and high on the adrenaline given by that kind of independence.\
  \ \n\nI arrived at the hostel and settled in. From the bunk bed across the room,\
  \ I heard a friendly voice, \"Hi, how are you?\", and when I looked up I saw a man\
  \ around 50 years old, all smiles. I told him I was taking a minute before going\
  \ out and he said he also arrived that day. I mentioned I was on holiday and that\
  \ it was my lifelong dream to set foot in that place. He explained that my words\
  \ brought him back to when he first came to the UK. He was an immigrant, from Pakistan,\
  \ and came here to build a better life for his kids. His voice trembled as he remembered\
  \ how small they were when they arrived and how scared he was that he wasn't going\
  \ to be able to provide for them, so that they could have an easier life. Easier\
  \ than his. \"All I ever wanted was for my kids to never go through what I did and\
  \ to have the opportunities I never had\". In his country he was a dentist, degree\
  \ and all, but is diplomas weren't valid here. \"I was supposed to take courses,\
  \ but there was no time for that. I had to find work immediately and provide for\
  \ my wife and kids\". And so he did. For over 20 years. The money he earned working\
  \ jobs in places far from what a dentist's clinic looks like helped achieve that.\
  \ His two children are now all grown up now. \"They both got into the schools they\
  \ wanted and didn't have to compromise on that. Now I can relax\". He beamed with\
  \ pride. I asked him what \"relax\" meant, after such a difficult journey through\
  \ his adult life. \"I live in Leicester actually. I came to London to take courses\
  \ in order to get a UK dentistry degree, so I can go back to my own dream\". I felt\
  \ a lump in my throat when he said those words. \"I have courses over the next week\
  \ and hostels are cheaper. Also, I get to meet new people and feel less alone\"\
  . We went on to chat about other things, like football, a passion we both shared,\
  \ and the fact that Leicester City FC, his local team, was about to win the Premier\
  \ League in a triumph impossible to imagine or repeat. \n\nI barely saw him over\
  \ the next few days, as I was busy being a tourist and he was busy with his courses.\
  \ I thought about him and his story on the plane back home and realized I didn't\
  \ even ask what his name was. But even without knowing his name, I knew his story.\
  \ The story of millions of people who put their dreams on hold because of other\
  \ priorities. I felt lucky to be a tourist, while he struggled for decades to make\
  \ ends meet in a foreign country. What an incredible man.\n\nI thought of him again\
  \ when Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the beloved Thai owner of Leicester City FC, died\
  \ in a terrible helicopter crash last year. Even though they came from different\
  \ backgrounds, I felt they both embodied the spirit of the city and what I always\
  \ thought this island was, in its core. A place for people to make their dreams\
  \ come true, to build a better life for themselves and the ones around them. No\
  \ matter where they came from.\n\nI will always believe traveling is more about\
  \ the people and less about the actual place. They make you feel like you are part\
  \ of something greater than amazing landmarks and incredible photos. They give you\
  \ the true memories, the ones that stay with you over the years. And that's the\
  \ best feeling in the world to me."
