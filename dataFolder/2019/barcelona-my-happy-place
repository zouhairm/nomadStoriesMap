Text: "Ever since a child I have always loved to travel and I often did but never\
  \ alone. I always felt safer and comfortable when travelling with others and didn't\
  \ have the guts to go anywhere alone as I was afraid.\nAt the age of 34 and after\
  \ a crazy break up with my boyfriend which took me years to recover from, I finally\
  \ decided to find myself.\nI was single, in a crappy job and felt sorry for myself\
  \ as I just seemed to be stuck with no direction. After watching Eat Pray Love and\
  \ The real Marigold Hotel alongside every other travel-love story, I decided to\
  \ do something out of my comfort zone and embark on my first solo trip abroad. I\
  \ had a burning desire to find myself and my happy place and so I did.\nNervous,\
  \ scared and  excited at the same time I decided to go to Barcelona for sun, sea\
  \ and sangria. \nAs soon as I stepped on the plane my holiday started and everything\
  \ was going to plan and I knew this was going be a great solo  adventure.\nmy plan\
  \ was to grab a taxi upon landing but to my luck they were on strike so I ended\
  \ up catching the Aerobus which worked out better as it was much cheaper than a\
  \ taxi.  With the sun beaming through the  window, I sat there quietly admiring\
  \ the views and the beautiful buildings... I was already in love with the place.\n\
  So excited I quickly checked in to my hotel room and to my surprise  was given the\
  \ deluxe  room on the top floor with a balcony and I only paid for the basic room.\
  \ I was feeling lucky and grateful  as I sat and enjoyed the views of the city with\
  \ for the whole afternoon before I rushed off to explore the city before dark .\
  \ There was no time to be wasted and i was sure to make the most of it.\nI wandered\
  \ the side streets and alley ways and discovered cool places to eat.. I was a little\
  \ uncomfortable the first time because i have never eaten alone before but as soon\
  \ as i sat down and looked across the room I noticed I wasn't the only solo diner\
  \ and I immediately felt at ease. There were no awkward stares from people it was\
  \ just nice\nAs the day went by i became more confident in  this beautiful , vibrant\
  \ and cosmopolitan city and also in myself. I met some wonderful people and  even\
  \ made friends along the way as this trip just got better and better for me.\nI\
  \ would spend the mornings sitting on the balcony, soaking in the sun and people\
  \ watching with a coffee in one hand and last nights churros in the other. I would\
  \ then take a stroll around the many street blocks, discovering  something new every\
  \ day and by the evening I would have a very late dinner as this was the norm and\
  \ finally head out to the local bars in Las Ramblas\n\nAs my holiday was coming\
  \ to a close, it hit me I didn't want to leave. This was no ordinary holiday for\
  \ me this was meant for me this trip made me find myself and there was just something\
  \ magical about this city and the people that I fell in love with and knew I had\
  \ a deep connection with this city, it felt like home but better and I knew I would\
  \ be coming back soon\n\nI met some lovely people from all walks of life and different\
  \ parts of the globe, some I will  see again and some i  probably won't. \nI would\
  \ spend a lot of time on my own sat in coffee shops or strolling the streets, reflecting\
  \ on life and really enjoying my own company for once and it never felt this good.\n\
  soon after i returned I felt lost and something was missing and it was my heart\
  \  which i left in Barcelona. I didn't expect to find my happy place in Barcelona\
  \ but I am so glad I did. \nAs Oscar Wilde once quoted \"Live life with no excuses,\
  \ travel with no regret\"."
