Text: "The other side \nHow I felt a foreigner in my own country.\n\nHave you ever\
  \ been to Baikal? Even though I have been plenty times (as I live not far from the\
  \ lake), that was my first hiking trip to the Great Baikal Trail. Ironically it\
  \ started with a \"great fail\". When you plan trips like that the first thing you\
  \ should do is to check the weather forecast. What I and my friends actually did,\
  \ however, we were not stopped by the rain and wind the forecast called for. So,\
  \ the fail was the mere decision to go hiking in rain. \n\nAs I already have asked,\
  \ have you ever been to Baikal? That\u2019s the question every foreigner receives\
  \ when he comes to Eastern Siberia and Irkutsk city. \nThis question is not surprising\
  \ as Baikal is almost the only worthy reason for tourists to come over here.\n\n\
  We met them at the starting point of our trip in Bolshiye Koty village. It didn\u2019\
  t take much time to figure out that Alina and Jana from Berlin just like Bart and\
  \ Peter from Warsaw were going the same way as we were - back to Listvyanka through\
  \ the Trail. As for three of us, it was a bit scary to hike and climb by ourselves,\
  \ the decision of going together with strangers came up conventionally.\n\nThereby\
  \ the mixed company of people who had just got to know each other was getting through\
  \ cliffs and woods under the rain along Baikal Lake. \n\nWhile our new foreigner\
  \ friends were just impressed by the views they saw during the trip, I was doubly\
  \ amazed. I couldn't imagine that wildlife landscapes would be so magnificent and\
  \ breath-taking even in poor weather. Besides I've been traveling to the Baikal\
  \ every summer in the past, but only in touristic areas never seeing mountain forests\
  \ and crashing into the steep rocks waves. That was a sort of a separate country\
  \ with its unique laws. The only who reigned there was pure nature. An accident\
  \ man got to this territory was only a subject who must obey. There were no beaches,\
  \ no electrical wires, no crowds of tourists leaving mountains of waste. Just us\
  \ and a Trail stretched about 24 kilometers. We also barely met strangers walking\
  \ towards, greeting us by unwritten Trail rule. I never knew this country before.\n\
  \nThat experience helped me to overemphasize my treatment to my homeland and wild\
  \ nature. \n\nHave I said our trip was a great fail? Forget that. Now I realize\
  \ we were fortunate to witness natural force in stunning glory."
