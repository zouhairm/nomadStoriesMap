Text: "They call Venice, The Floating City, and it is just that. A taxi boat brings\
  \ you back and forth from the mainland and lets your eyes take in all the beautiful\
  \ architecture and culture as the boat buoys along. You find you allow yourself\
  \ a moment to relax, which can be hard to do when travelling with a group. You seem\
  \ to always be moving and going to the next planned event, but this boat gives you\
  \ the much needed time to comprehend this floating city and watch the water hit\
  \ the buildings in a strangely soothing manner. \n\nThe best thing about this amazing\
  \ place is it's inhabitants, not only on The Floating City, but the mainland too.\
  \ They know they live in this mind boggling curiosity, although it may not seem\
  \ as magical to them as it does to us. Music floats through the cobblestone roads,\
  \ begging you to find it's owner and listen for the night, which is exactly what\
  \ I did. \n\nThe notes were enchanting and I knew had to see the hands playing the\
  \ guitar. I walked down the cobblestone road and wandered upon a small bar filled\
  \ with raucous laughter and drinks readily flowing. The lone man playing the guitar\
  \ sat near a microphone, but didn't use it, just strumming a melody that any woodland\
  \ fairy would die to be present for. \n\nThese are the moments that make you want\
  \ to never go home. When you find a local place that hasn't been touched by tourists\
  \ and lets you see a glimpse into the life of a native. I sat at the bar and rattled\
  \ of a drink I new how to say in Italian, trying to blend in. The maestro smiled\
  \ over at me and I smiled back, not wanting to interrupt. The man next to me attempted\
  \ to start a conversation, but since my Italian was poor, he quickly switched to\
  \ English and I thanked him. I learned of his family, his wife and daughters, who\
  \ no longer lived with them, and his life in Venice. I explained that I was in town\
  \ for research and wanted to get to know the real Venice and not the city that all\
  \ tourists found. He smiled then and told me to leave my drink on the bar and follow\
  \ him.\n\nI know you should not be going off with strangers in a foreign city, but\
  \ how else will you get to know the hidden gems filled with delectable Gelato and\
  \ a Cacio A Pepe that would knock your socks off? The answer is, you wouldn't. Not\
  \ without the help of someone who knew exactly where to go.\n\nMy new guide, Matteo,\
  \ called his wife to meet us, then led me to a restaurant that was a off an alley\
  \ and down two staircases and I know it sounds suspect, but it landed us in an oblong\
  \ shaped restaurant that smelled of heaven with wood fire oven's in the back. His\
  \ wife arrived shortly after and we ordered pizza and pasta to share, wanting to\
  \ be sure we got the full taste of Italy in one meal.\n\nThere are many factors\
  \ that go into delicious food, but there is something else entirely that can change\
  \ the way food tastes. If someone doesn't care about what they're preparing, then\
  \ the flavor will reflect that. In Italy, not only do they care, but they love every\
  \ dish before it leaves the kitchen and every bite shows that. The melt in your\
  \ mouth pizza, followed by a simple pasta with marinara that tasted like nothing\
  \ I've ever had or made before. \n\nIt teaches you to appreciate how going back\
  \ to the basics can make a food new again. It teaches you to appreciate any local\
  \ willing to take the time out of their day to help you understand the love they\
  \ have for their city. It teaches you to appreciate a new city and a new culture\
  \ and to immerse yourself in it for all the time you have for once you've left,\
  \ that feeling doesn't linger long.\n\nAnd to all the pasta I've left behind, I'll\
  \ be back for you."
