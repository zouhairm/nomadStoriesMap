Text: "For three years I wanted to travel to South East Asia. As an Australian it\u2019\
  s affordable, close and hey, everybody is doing it! \nBeing a female in my 20s I\
  \ was hesistant to backpack on my own. Thus,  I decided to book a tour with Intrepid.\
  \ It was a 29 years and under group that went through Cambodia and Vietnam. \n\n\
  I want to say that Cambodia was the time of my life, and that travelling is always\
  \ such a blast. But I spent 9 days completely weak, dizzy and unconscious (sleeping..\
  \ just sleeping) , due to a bad reaction from anti malaria pills. I won\u2019t lie,\
  \ I was freaking terrified! At one point we were in a home stay 5 hours from the\
  \ city hospital and I had NO idea what was wrong with me. What if it was a heart\
  \ problem that stemmed from an unknown cancer and once it took over my body completely\
  \ I would only have 3 hours left to live???? I really needed to stop googling things,\
  \ that\u2019s for sure. \n\nEventually I stopped taking the tablets and BAM Instant\
  \ health, positivity restored, the threat of cancer subsided and my energy ready\
  \ for Vietnam. And, my dear readers, I am so glad that it was. For on our first\
  \ night in Ho Chi Minh city we joined the rest of our tour group.  Most of which\
  \ were, naturally, Australian, but there was also a good looking English boy who\
  \ took my fancy. I couldn\u2019t help having a crush on him, it was like my subconscious\
  \ was trying to make up for never having the opportunity to meet and woo Hugh Grant.\
  \ I want my own Love Actually, actually. \n\nWe connected straight away, there was\
  \ no doubt about it but it takes time for feelings to develop. Perhaps I needed\
  \ a little romantic inspiration from a romantic town. Que: Hoi An.  If you\u2019\
  ve never been to Hoi An then this is going to become very difficult to explain as\
  \ this city is NOTHING you\u2019ve ever seen before. The city is broken into old\
  \ town and new town. In old town the walls are yellow, the doors are blue, there\
  \ are gondolas in the water, lanterns at every corner, secret alleyways that lead\
  \ to beautiful coffee shops, and a nightlife like no other. It\u2019s a mix of France,\
  \ Japan, Italy and (obviously) Vietnam.  That night, we all had dinner as a group,\
  \ but I couldn\u2019t stop talking to my British Boy. Perhaps it was the romantic\
  \ music playing in the background, or the fact that cocktails were only $3 and it\
  \ would be rude not to have a few, but we decided to sneak off and explore the city.\
  \ Oh boy, we came across beautiful lights, smiling people, a bar dedicated to Mr\
  \ Bean and eventually a bar with live music and a pool table. Upon entry we bought\
  \ a few drinks and talked eachothers ears off (occasionally practising our Vietnamese\
  \ ).  After an hour we realised that the band was missing a lead singer, and they\
  \ would play a well known song while an audience member came on stage to sing. They\
  \ started playing Rolling on a River. This sparked something in my modern day Hugh,\
  \ and he raced on stage and sang (beautifully!) the entirety of the song. It was\
  \ that moment that I fell for him. In an unknown bar, surrounded by happy locals,\
  \ in the middle of Hoi An. \n\nMonths later, we\u2019re still together.  I thank\
  \ my lucky stars for that perfect evening in Hoi An and hey! If you\u2019re having\
  \ relationship problems, maybe book a flight and see who this mysterious, romantic\
  \ town will lead you to."
