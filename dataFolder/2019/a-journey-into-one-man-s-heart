Text: "\u201CCanada! What a beautiful smile you have,\u201D he returned as I stepped\
  \ into his trap, unwittingly flattered by his compliment. He had stolen a glance\
  \ from me as I passed him on a busy street in Ho Chi Minh City and asked me where\
  \ I was from. As an experienced traveller, I was well accustomed to this ruse\u2014\
  peddlers beckoning for you to engage them in conversation before they begin their\
  \ impenitent plea. \n\nSomething about his jovial complexion broke my disdain. The\
  \ moment our eyes met he began spinning his web, carefully weaving each strand until\
  \ I was tightly in his embrace\u2014cunningly convincing me of an offer I didn\u2019\
  t even know I needed or wanted at the time. \n\nIt was mid-morning and I\u2019d\
  \ yet to venture beyond the central boulevard out front of my hotel. Every attempt\
  \ to cross the street was opposed by a constant and rapid flow of traffic\u2014\
  a perilous undertaking for a foreigner unaccustomed to their roadside conventions.\
  \ I needed to find a way to secure my passage.\n\nHis name was Cuong, but he assured\
  \ me I should call him Diamond. He quickly swooned me into hiring him for a day\
  \ tour around the city. By the time he returned me to my hotel that evening he\u2019\
  d convinced me to engage him in a tour of the Mekong Delta. Although I\u2019m certain\
  \ now he was guilefully plotting our sanctimonious union.\n\nThe next morning I\
  \ woke with trepidation, fretting that I\u2019d been played for a simpleton. Wondering\
  \ if my gallant companion would return to claim his bride or if he had already smarted\
  \ off with my pre-paid deposit. I lambasted myself for being so naive. And then\
  \ I began to wonder if he did return for his fair maiden, what dubious misfortune\
  \ awaited me?\n\nI quickly began typing out a letter home to bear witness to my\
  \ calamity, giving just enough indication of my last known whereabouts without raising\
  \ the alarm. I told my family I was heading out on a tour around the Mekong Delta\
  \ and that they should expect to hear from me again in four days time. I then hauled\
  \ my backpack to the street corner to await the verdict. \n\nOf course, he showed\
  \ if not a minute or two early. I cursed myself again for being so incredulous.\
  \ With a sigh of relief, I climbed onto the back of his motorcycle and we set out\
  \ on our exploration of the Vietnamese countryside.\n\nWeaving our way through traffic,\
  \ we exited the city. He leaned back and shouted at me pointing to the tandem beside\
  \ us, \u201CYou can wrap your arms around me like this,\u201D implying his ardent\
  \ hope that I would tuck my body in closer to his. Our first stop was a visit to\
  \ the hospital to see his ailing father.\n\nI was caught unprepared for the way\
  \ in which he would invite me so deeply into his world. Bearing witness to an intimate\
  \ moment between father and son on what was very likely one of his final days, I\
  \ secretly wished I had the coveted power to make myself disappear. Not knowing\
  \ where to avert my gaze\u2014I suddenly found myself interested in the curtains.\
  \ It was the ecstasy of defeat. He smiled at me reassuringly, skillfully drawing\
  \ me into his world and evincing me of everything that was raw and beautiful about\
  \ it.\n\nHaving secured his father\u2019s approval meant we could resume our affair.\
  \ We spent our days lazing in hammocks at roadside stops drinking iced coffees and\
  \ in the evenings we chased fireflies and laughed uncontrollably over copious bottles\
  \ of rice wine. When the time came for me to return to my solitary journey, I felt\
  \ a pang of regret knowing the emptiness that he would leave behind. \n\nI never\
  \ would have known this world beyond tour buses had I not returned his charming\
  \ advances\u2014an admiring companion forever etched in my heart. To this day I\
  \ can still hear his voice ringing in my head, \u201CYou never try to you never\
  \ know.\u201D While I never did accept his offer to take him for my husband, I admired\
  \ his tenacity. We both took a risk, him with his heart and me with my faith."
