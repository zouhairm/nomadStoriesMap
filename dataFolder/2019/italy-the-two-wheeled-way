Text: "This is the story of my first motorcycle tour, a thousand-mile, weeklong trip\
  \ on a rented motorcycle. It\u2019s a circular, counter-clockwise tour starting\
  \ in Florence, taking me to Venice, the Cinque Terre villages on the Mediterranean\
  \ coast, Pisa, the island of Elba, and finally back to Florence.\nIn Florence, I\
  \  make my connection with Alessandro, who has a small motorcycle repair shop who\
  \ outfits me with a 500cc Honda sport bike, but not until after an hour spent filling\
  \ out a stack of paperwork (this is Italy, so what did I expect?). I leave much\
  \ later than I had planned for the first and longest stretch of my trip, a 170-mile\
  \ ride to Venice.\nI arrive in Venice in the late afternoon, settle in, and grab\
  \ a bite to eat (pizza, of course). At dusk, I take a stroll along the waterfront\
  \ of Guidecca, the island I\u2019m staying on. I can see St. Mark\u2019s Square\
  \ and Cathedral across the wide Guidecca canal and I am mesmerized by the beauty\
  \ of Venice lighting herself up for the night.\nI get up early to tour Venice on\
  \ foot and by vaporetto, the city\u2019s water buses. I\u2019m captivated by this\
  \ elegant, decaying city; it really is as magnificent as the guidebooks say it is.\
  \ I would love to stay longer, but to make it to my next destination on time, I\
  \ leave early in the afternoon and head to my next stop, Cinque Terre.\nThese five\
  \ isolated fishing villages are precariously perched on the rugged cliffs of the\
  \ Italian Riviera. My journey to Riomaggiore, the only Cinque Terre village accessible\
  \ by road, is through a drenching rain and even a little bit of hail.\nBut the rain\
  \ stops, the sky clears, and cliff-hugging Riomaggiore is as beautiful as its depictions\
  \ on postcards. I\u2019m here early enough to spend the rest of the day hiking on\
  \ the trails that connect the villages. I hike north from Riomaggiore, on the famous\
  \ Via dell\u2019Amore, to Manarola, and then on to Corniglia, the middle of the\
  \ five villages.\nThe hiking trails are exhilarating, especially when stepping to\
  \ the edge and looking down at the rocky white coastline hitting the crystal blue\
  \ water of the Mediterranean. I consider continuing on to the final two villages\
  \ so I can experience more of this exhilaration.\nBut alas, hiking under the hot\
  \ Tuscan sun for just two hours has done me in and I can\u2019t go on. This upsets\
  \ me, because I\u2019m a little obsessive when I play tourist. If there are five\
  \ villages here, I want to see all five of them, dammit!\nI reluctantly return to\
  \ Riomaggiore and my motorcycle. I ride 75 miles down the coast before stopping\
  \ for the night. I\u2019m about halfway to Pisa, my next destination.\nWhen I arrive\
  \ on the outskirts of Pisa, I have no trouble navigating to the center of the city.\
  \ At every intersection, there are signs directing traffic to La Torre. Clearly,\
  \ this city knows it\u2019s a one-trick pony. But it\u2019s a pony worth seeing.\n\
  Photos of the tower do not adequately convey how much the darn thing leans, and\
  \ looking at the tower gives you the feeling that it will topple at any moment.\n\
  You can see all there is to see in Pisa in an hour or two and so, by mid-afternoon,\
  \ I head south and hop on a ferry to the Mediterranean island of Elba [section on\
  \ Elba omitted to meet 700 word limit]\nI return to Florence, and Alessandro looks\
  \ at the trip odometer, which reads 628 kilometers. I point and say mille (one thousand)\
  \ to indicate that the odometer has rolled over. When he realizes I have ridden\
  \ 1,628 kilometers in seven days, he gets a big grin on his face and I get a hearty\
  \ pat on the back.\nYes, I think to myself, I do deserve a pat on the back. After\
  \ all, I\u2019ve just successfully completed my first motorcycle tour: a 1,012-mile\
  \ trip, solo, and in a foreign country to boot. Definitely the ride of a lifetime.\n\
  Well, not quite. I\u2019ve got to go back and see those two Cinque Terre villages\
  \ I skipped, right?"
