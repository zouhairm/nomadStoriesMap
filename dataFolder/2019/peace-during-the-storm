Text: "A trip to Israel was announced during a service in my church, I wanted to go\
  \ but I couldn't afford it. During that time I was going through a very tough situation,\
  \ some thing I never imagined I would have to face. I would be constantly hearing\
  \ about the trip but stopped paying mind to it. I was experiencing hardship so I\
  \ was focused on the problem. While the days went by, I received a message stating\
  \ that someone wanted to pay for my trip. I was shocked and confused at the same\
  \ time. I wasn't expecting such gift from someone I did see often but didn't quite\
  \ know. After the news of course I went to thank the person and started getting\
  \ prepared for the trip. I had soo much turmoil going on but at the same time I\
  \ was excited for an escape. I love to travel and I've never been to this side of\
  \ the world. Why wouldn't I be? I knew I would come back to the mess again but why\
  \ not take a break from it? Time went by and the big day arrived! We were getting\
  \ ready to depart. We had a layover in Turkey which I would had loved to explore;\
  \ then we flew for about 2 more hours and arrived to Netanya, Israel. I was extremely\
  \ eager to experience the magic of being on a new land. With that being said, we\
  \ had an amazing tour guide and driver and everyday we would see the beauty of such\
  \ country. The views were breath taking and inspiring and the food was delicious.\
  \ The people were extremely kind and giving. The places where we shopped would always\
  \ end up gifting us something. Some would even welcome us with homemade beverages\
  \ including tea and coffee. \nFrom Tele Viv to Jerusalem, from Jericho to Bethlehem\
  \ we experienced soo much variety of culture, it was amazing. Every part of the\
  \ country told a different story. \nLet me tell you about my camel ride in Jericho!\
  \ \nIt's like I was going back to my childhood, last time I was on a camel I was\
  \ 5 years old in Connecticut, Massachusetts and I am now 22. It was nerve wrecking\
  \ but super fun! I felt like I was on top of the world while sitting on this animal.\
  \ \nAs the days went by Israel started to feel like home, I was getting use to the\
  \ food and all the adventures! But I have to say my favorite place was Mt Carmel.\
  \ This was an extremely rocky mountain, but while literally hiking up I felt this\
  \ inexplicable peace. We were actually going up to have a service, which included\
  \ singing and praying. During our time there everything seemed to be still and quiet\
  \ and suddenly it started to get really windy like if some sort of storm was coming.\
  \ But the weird thing about it all was that I was not afraid I was at peace. My\
  \ heart, mind and soul were at peace. It was a peace I couldn't comprehend, it literally\
  \ covered me. It was soo much, that I couldn't hold back my tears. I felt that besides\
  \ everything I was going through things were going to be okay and were going to\
  \ get better. At the moment I didn't even know why all the doors opened up and made\
  \ this trip possible but now I can say I know why. I didn't just need an escape,\
  \ I don't just love travelling but I needed peace during my storm. I could have\
  \ experienced peace back home, but Israel was the channel used for my peace. Not\
  \ only was this unforgettable but it taught me a lot. I learned to not force things,\
  \ it's okay to want something, we all do. But is it really for you, is it your time?\
  \ I wanted to go on this trip but I didn't push the door open, it opened alone.\
  \ Not only that, but it reminded me that it doesn't matter what we face in life,\
  \ pain isn't eternal. We can encounter peace even when we feel the heavy rain on\
  \ our shoulders."
