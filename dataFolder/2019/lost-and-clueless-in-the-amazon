Text: "So I was living in Rio De Janeiro, sick and tired of big city life and stumbled\
  \ across a cheap flight to Manaus. Without much money I thought that sounds nice\
  \ with a romanticized view of the amazon and took the next plane there which was\
  \ in a few days. Soon as departed (at night) the aircraft the intense heat hit me,\
  \ and jumped in to a cab to the cheap hostel I was staying at. Cab driver was subdued\
  \ and almost depressed, with a John Lennon speech in the background talking about\
  \ Love. The layout of the city seemed fault and more industrial with a totally different\
  \ ambient, I was already missing Rio. I was searching for boats up the amazon and\
  \ in the end purchased a ticket to the frontier with Colombia and Peru. I had to\
  \ get my own hammock for a 11 day journey upstream. toddlers were crawling into\
  \ my hammock during the day, any chance to sleep and knockout was found how sleeps.\
  \ The atmosphere was good, good food. Ended up realizing it was a bit of a party\
  \ as everybody was sleeping with each other on the boat. I was only foreigner bar\
  \ 2 brits I stumbled on. Eventually reached Tabatinga, last town in Brazil, And\
  \ just a short 2 minute borderless walk to Leticia, in Colombia. Everything changes\
  \ suddenly in Leticia, the people (appearance amongst everything), way of life,\
  \ (Will explain in detail But not enough writing space here), music etc.\u2026 Any\
  \ way I had borrowed and made notes out of the lonely planet of the 2 English on\
  \ the boat previously from Manaus, and had opted for the super cheap Luncheon Boat\
  \ option from the Peruvian border settlement down to Iquitos. So during duck I approached\
  \ the port of Leticia and boats were readily available which took me to the Luncheon\
  \ boat, approaching the boat, it looked like a large piece rust and scaffolding\
  \ on a large metal raft. This Boat was clearly not made for passenger travel nd\
  \ the primary purpose was to move cargo and goods up and down the Peruvian amazon.\
  \ Food was not included on this boat and neither nobody working on it cared as well.\
  \ The journey was approximately 4 days however felt like 4 years. The motor of the\
  \ engine made such a large noise, while in the middle of the night the boat would\
  \ usually just cash in to the side bank, and usually stay there overnight. I could\
  \ hear constant changes over my head of people changing hammocks with ongoing people\
  \ and families exiting and arriving and shuffling. Bats and Mosquitos were constant\
  \ everywhere. The river was narrower and seemed denser and someone even spotted\
  \ an anaconda. The atmosphere on this boat was vastly different to the Brazilian\
  \ one, quite serious, subdued. There was one other foreign (looked American or French)\
  \ looking person on the boat who seemed to have an eye on me. He happened to be\
  \ Colombian and was with his son (who looked local like everyone else). In the end\
  \ after arriving at Iquitos I was persuaded by the Colombian guy to go back to his\
  \ house. So to get to the place I rode on the back of a high powered motor bike\
  \ fast on bends and dips with luggage and no helmet. Ending up at the house, apart\
  \ from the wife and a few friends of the wife everybody happened o be Colombian.\
  \ There were chickens running around. The people seemed fine, in the end I had slept\
  \ there for a night. Thinking it was time for me to leave. The hospitality was good.\
  \ The Host was sharpening the blade in front of me, and when I hinted in should\
  \ go he seemed disappointed asking me if I wanted hard drugs, or women, he would\
  \ bring. He hinted How I got my money and suggested that I just ask my mum for money.\
  \ Feeling a bit uncomfortable a took my bags hugged them,left to be greeted to a\
  \ street of barking dogs. TO be continued this is a brief overview to fit the wording."
