Text: "Never having flown out of South Africa before the first destination I had my\
  \ eyes set on was Cambodia. Not knowing what adventures await me upon getting there\
  \ I was thrown into the deep end of a culture I was unfamiliar with. Upon arriving\
  \ things were nothing like they were back home. Not only was the culture completely\
  \ different but there was a language barrier. Not being able to be understood helps\
  \ you come up with creative ways in communicating. Thanks to technology it was not\
  \ that difficult. Getting around in the streets of Phnom Penh was initially quite\
  \ scary as the road regulations are not entirely followed and gives you a few near\
  \ death experiences appreciating life so much more. Once you get the hang of it\
  \ though you realize it\u2019s not that scary to begin with. The traditional food\
  \ is amazing. Very unconventional and nothing you would think about how a meal should\
  \ go together but you need to try and experience something in order to know whether\
  \ or not you would enjoy it. The country is very 3rd world but that does not stop\
  \ the being from being as humble and helpful as they are. They look to help wherever\
  \ they can and don\u2019t expect anything in return. This incident happened when\
  \ my scooter ran flat and the locals at the market were more than willing to help\
  \ two foreign girls out who had no idea what the problem was. They took control\
  \ and got the scooter up and running without us having to even ask for help. This\
  \ touched my soul because they didn\u2019t expect nothing in return. Just a good\
  \ gesture of kind will to the next human being. I unfortunately had to leave the\
  \ kingdom of wonder much sooner than expected and I cannot wait to go back to experience\
  \ more of what a beautiful country it is."
