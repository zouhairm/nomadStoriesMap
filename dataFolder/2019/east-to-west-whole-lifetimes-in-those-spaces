Text: "The night before my flight east, as a first step to driving west, I finally\
  \ took a hurried look at the AAA map of the United States. Unfolded, it unleashed\
  \ pinks and blues, greens and yellows and reds. I realized (as if for the first\
  \ time) that I live in a very large country. And I had somewhat blindly agreed to\
  \ drive across it. Not knowing which states or highways we\u2019d cross. Too ignorant\
  \ to know what I might need to prepare. \n\nI\u2019ve driven in Mexico, Italy, Israel,\
  \ and tracked lots of miles in the United States but I\u2019d never driven across\
  \ the entire country. I wasn\u2019t sure that I\u2019d be able to safely make the\
  \ drive, carrying my youngest child, newly graduated from college, with all her\
  \ belongings stuffed into the rental car, from one end of the country to the other.\n\
  \nI had dreamed of driving across the United States since before I could drive.\
  \ Whether this grew out of family vacations up Highway 99 when I\u2019d stay awake\
  \ listening to the steady click of my dad switching the brights on and off with\
  \ his left foot, or from reading Jack Kerouac, I don\u2019t know. I simply know\
  \ that the road has always called me and here I was, about to embark on the mother\
  \ of all open road trips, having hardly slept or had time to ponder the journey\
  \ in any meaningful way. Instead of researching routes or destinations, I had been\
  \ consumed with graduation festivities and helping my daughter clear out her dorm\
  \ room. \n\nI spent the morning before we disembarked cleaning our Airbnb cottage\
  \ in Vermont. When we finally shoved off, my thoughts were on the mountains of suitcases\
  \ and tents and boxes of books and bags of food and all the other detritus from\
  \ college life and travel, now crammed into every space in our rented Camry. I wondered\
  \ whether I\u2019d be able to see out the rear-view mirror.\n\nWe pulled out of\
  \ the muddy driveway in Monkton, Vermont and headed west. This first night was the\
  \ only room I\u2019d booked, giving us a target as we drove across the southern\
  \ tip of Lake Champlain and crossed into New York. The hills were green and timbery.\
  \ The roads were narrow and twisting \u2013 less extreme than the Sierra Nevada\
  \ mountain highways I was used to but daunting because I had no idea where the road\
  \ would turn, or when I\u2019d have to slam on the brakes. My daughter slept and\
  \ I drove, fairly certain I knew where I was going, but not really sure. I simply\
  \ focused on pushing westward. \n\nEach day followed the same pattern: I drove while\
  \ my daughter alternately caught up on sleep and used her phone to search routes\
  \ and lodging. Each day was also completely different,  as we crossed New York,\
  \ Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, South Dakota, Nebraska, Colorado, Utah, Arizona,\
  \ Nevada and finally California. All were roads I had never driven \u2013 narrow\
  \ farm roads where I pulled over to make room for oncoming tractors, state highways\
  \ pelted with rain so heavy we had to stop driving, and my favorite, a terrifying\
  \ 30-mile gravel road that led us south from Badlands National Park toward Nebraska\
  \ and Colorado, rhythmically thumping the entire way.\n\nThe night before we began\
  \ our journey I didn\u2019t sleep well. I was worried \u2013 my daughter\u2019s\
  \ life would literally be in my hands and as awful as it makes me feel to admit,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t sure I was up for the task. However, I did get behind the wheel\
  \ and drive. Near Bluff, Utah, with a couple thousand miles behind us, I knew that\
  \ we were going to make it all the way just fine. Somehow I had worked through what\
  \ had seemed like crippling exhaustion, my worries about paying for gas and motels,\
  \ and every other thought that might have stopped me. \n\nWe arrived home in California\
  \ just after dark. We were giddy and it felt strange to unpack the car, removing\
  \ every trace of us before returning it to Hertz. We had made it. One mile following\
  \ another, 3,400 miles from Vermont to California and our journey was over."
