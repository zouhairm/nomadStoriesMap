Text: "'There, there!'.. As the forest guides hissed, I turned my head towards the\
  \ nature induced majestic and human eye's coveted predator. The black and yellow\
  \ stripped Tiger gave a don't-care look at us and started lapping it's tongue against\
  \ the water. We watched it, bemused by its magnifying aura. After days of cat and\
  \ mouse game, we caught a glimpse of the tiger who's in fact invoking the old habit\
  \ of cannibalism. After reading in the news the strange habit of tiger cannibalism,\
  \ I went to Kanha national park, Madhya Pradesh, to catch a glimpse of the tiger\
  \ who not only fought with a tigress but also savoured it. These solitary living\
  \ beings have their own way of expressing emotions and a deep rooted passion against\
  \ their dominated area gives rise to fights with their own kind. A forest, being\
  \ dedicated to tigers,  is a lot of hard work in order to keep these living beings\
  \ thriving in the nature.\nThe locals in Kanha have devoted themselves to the service\
  \ of the tigers. They don't care if the tigers enter the buffer zone and in turn\
  \ destroy their fields or domesticated animals. They believe that they reside in\
  \ THEIR area. It's the tiger's habitat and it should live peacefully. A town fully\
  \ dedicated to the well being of the tigers and it's their priority to keep the\
  \ poachers at bay is a commendable. \nThere's an amazing milieu between the tigers\
  \ and the residents of the area. The worry sketched on their faces when they find\
  \ a tigress dying, invokes a muted, deep connection between the two forms of living\
  \ beings.\nKanha National park is located in the laps of the Vindhyas. The old mountains\
  \ and the shady trees are the natural habitat for the national animal of India i.e\
  \ the Royal Bengal Tiger. Along with this are the barasinghas. Horned deers, with\
  \ their antlers having twelve branches. These deers have a mythological history\
  \ which is all the more daunting to search for them in the forest just to catch\
  \ a glimpse of them!"
