Text: "I have traveled to over 40 countries at the mere age of 26 because travel is\
  \ my one true passion. Meeting people from all over the world brings me so much\
  \ joy that is has become insatiable. Whilst living in Europe, i would travel every\
  \ weekend to discover a new city, a new culture and make friends with the locals\
  \ to get a deeper understanding of my travel destination. To me travel is art -\
  \ it is a way to rediscover yourself whilst you discover a city - I pay attention\
  \ to my feelings and what elements of my environment fuel certain emotions. It\u2019\
  s not simply seeing the main sights, but it is experiencing the culture so you come\
  \ back anew and inspired. Having been to Portugal before, I understand it\u2019\
  s rich culture, vibrant society, scrumptious food, delicious wine, colourful art\
  \ and architecture, and some of the most breathtaking views I have ever experienced.\
  \ My travel story will be more localised - I want to eat where the locals eat, dance\
  \ where the locals do, shop authentic Portuguese goods and live with the locals\
  \ to give my reader a chance to discover the real Portugal. After my trip to Portugal,\
  \ I was so inspired by the colourful architecture of the city that I took up painting\
  \ and am now invested in abstract art. I can\u2019t wait to go back to Portugal\
  \ and discover what else it has in store for me! I can\u2019t wait to inspire my\
  \ readers to not only visit these beautiful country but also come back feeling richer\
  \ and inspired."
