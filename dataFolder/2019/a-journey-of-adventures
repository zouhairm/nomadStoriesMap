Text: "Philippines is my home, and I am proud to be a filipina, despite of my country's\
  \ reputation, I strongly believed that my country is worthy of people who tend to\
  \ make a difference in life. However, when I met a spanish guy in Palawan Philippines,\
  \ I took him around the city to see how beautiful my home town is, I also let him\
  \ try the street foods and sea foods that are very famous which is located at the\
  \ city Baywalk.\nFor me being a local is wasn't so hard sharing the ideas, culture\
  \ and traditions of filipinos, as we all know that Spanish colonised Philippines\
  \ for 333 years and as of now in the Philippines we all still living the way like\
  \ Spaniards before. Ofcourse in this generation its more hightect and more open\
  \ minded and sometimes its too much to bare. Anyway, because of many reasons why\
  \ Philippines and Spain had connections we became good friends in a way that we\
  \ like more each other more than it used to be. After a day he needs to go back\
  \ to Spain and in my side I wasn't so sure if he felt something like I do\U0001F614\
  After a week I have to leave as well as I am working abroad as a teacher, we talked\
  \ almost everyday on the phone chatting and video call and our being friends status\
  \ changes to something good,something that it makes me smile and help me to be more\
  \ strong and contented. After few months he invited me to visit him and his family\
  \ in Spain but I wasn't sure if its a good idea or not. So, he send me an invitation\
  \ letter from the Mayor's office just to be sure I can get a visa to Spain, in my\
  \ behalf I present all documents needed from my recent job and all other supporting\
  \ documents, it wasn't hard as I remember applying 4 years ago and I was denied,\
  \ but this time with him he really make sure that I will not be rejected, he hired\
  \ a lawyer so the process of presenting documents are good and legal and well after\
  \ just few days frim the moment I applied my visa is granted\U0001F600I was crying\
  \ on the tuktuk when I saw my visa indicate on my passport, and imagine I don't\
  \ have phone for that two days because someone robed me at the street market in\
  \ Phom pehn Cambodia, but anyway since I have laptop I immediately call him and\
  \ announced the good news, my visa is granted\"I've got the visa! Now I am in the\
  \ north of Spain, living with the man I thought would never be interested in me,\
  \ as we are living in one roof I can see how happy he is being with me, and everyday\
  \ as promised he really take and care of me even in smallest things around us...I\
  \ am happy that despite the differences and the miles away between me and him, he\
  \ really make things possible for us to be just beside each others arms again\U0001F618\
  \ \nI am Layla Balagon and this is just a part of my story, if you'll giving me\
  \ a chance to travel and work by writting all the adventures and information,I hope\
  \ that this short story of mine which is real life will inspired you.\nI also write\
  \ a story about my life all the ups and down, people I met along the way and the\
  \ experience who change me, because I want that people know how to live a life even\
  \ being poor,different or uneducated, we always have a choice to choose what is\
  \ the best, we only live once and for that we should not stop doing what makes us\
  \ happy!"
