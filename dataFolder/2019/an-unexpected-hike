Text: "\"And now?\". These were the only two words bouncing around our heads in that\
  \ warm afternoon of July. \n\nMy friend Igor and I had pushed that FIAT Panda to\
  \ its limits uphill in the mountains of Trentino Alto-Adige, but at that moment\
  \ we were a little bit confused.\n\n\"So, let's recapitulate it,\" Igor said. \"\
  If we want to try this canyoning experience, we have to reach that goddamned shelter\
  \ right now. Local people told us that there is a lake and our goal is to arrive\
  \ on the other side through a dam. Therefore, firstly, we have to find this dam\"\
  . \n\nWe had just one path in front of us. We had no alternatives but traveling\
  \ along it and see where it would have arrived. We pushed ourselves into the wood.\
  \ The complete silence was broken just by a far sound of water flowing, which could\
  \ mean that maybe the lake was not so far. \n\nAfter a while, we reached a small\
  \ valley crossed by a stream. The sun rays made the water sparkling, and the reflection\
  \ on the white pebbles created a magnificent painting of peace. No animals around,\
  \ no people, and, most of all, no path. Suddenly, a yearned help stood out in front\
  \ of us. A sign told us that the shelter we were looking for was just... 40 minutes\
  \ from us. Wait, 40 minutes? That was a lot. We knew that we would have missed the\
  \ canyoning experience, but in that precise moment finding the shelter was a matter\
  \ of pride. We followed the direction of the sign, going in the opposite direction\
  \ of the stream. \n\nThe silence of that valley was broken just by the water. One\
  \ step after the other, and after twenty minutes of walk, nothing. We expected to\
  \ see a huge shadow projected by a giant dam, and maybe some stairs to reach the\
  \ top. However, the more we walked, the more wild the environment around us appeared.\
  \ In our mind, on the surface we were worried if we were on the right path, but\
  \ on a deep level we were enraptured by the place in which we were. \n\nThe stream\
  \ was flowing creating bends again and again with a rare prowess, forcing us to\
  \ cross it multiple times. It turned out that it was funny to maintain the balance\
  \ on the rocks on the surface, a game that brought out from us that joyful mentality\
  \ that only children have.\n\nThe typical evergreen vegetation around was opening\
  \ more and more, creating a majestic sight in front of us. The mountains stood out\
  \ surrounding the valley, like a peaceful and silent hug from Mother Nature. \n\n\
  The fate was against us in finding that shelter but we did not stop. We kept walking,\
  \ telling ourselves that we would get there. Suddenly reality slapped us in the\
  \ face. A gravel hill in front of us was saying proudly: \"game over, end of the\
  \ line, you shall not pass!\". We checked our watches. More than one hour of walking.\
  \ Clearly, the sign we had seen one hour before was a scam. No lake and no dam at\
  \ all. It was time to get back.\n\nThe sun was going down and in a few minutes,\
  \ it was behind the mountains. The shining valley was changing little by little\
  \ into a darker desert. Thrilled by the deadline that the sun was giving to us,\
  \ we moved faster following the stream.\n\nWe finally reached the starting point.\
  \ In the moment of getting back to the car, suddenly we asked ourselves: \"What\
  \ if we have chosen the wrong direction?\". We had to verify that theory despite\
  \ we were late and the sun was keeping going down. Pushed by the curiosity we walked\
  \ this time in the direction of the stream.\n\nSurprisingly, after just five minutes\
  \ there it was: the lake stood out in front of us. As a result, Igor and I ended\
  \ in a huge laugh. We were amused by the fact that we had totally missed the direction,\
  \ but we were aware of the hike we had had in that wonderful, peaceful and unforgettable\
  \ valley."
