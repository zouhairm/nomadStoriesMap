Text: "The view of the Minato Mirai harbour, complete with the distinctive Cosmo World\
  \ ferris wheel, was enough to tempt me outside after a day of time travel and transfers.\
  \ It was like magic: I left New Zealand at midnight, bumped into my ex-partner at\
  \ a coffee kiosk in Hong Kong Airport, then arrived in Yokohama in the early evening.\
  \ I couldn't believe it was still Monday.\n\nYokohama is a picturesque coastal city\
  \ only 32km southwest of Tokyo. It's Japan's second largest city and one of the\
  \ most popular date spots in the country. Its architecture and character bloomed\
  \ from tragedy: the Great Kanto earthquake of September 1923 and the Allied bombings\
  \ of the 1940s. Each disaster destroyed much of Yokohama, but true to the Japanese\
  \ maxim of \"Ganbaru \u2014 to stubbornly persevere\", the city not only recovered\
  \ but thrived. On that first warm autumn evening in Yokohama I took a head-clearing\
  \ walk in the gorgeous oceanside gardens of the Yamashita District, built from the\
  \ rubble of the 1923 earthquake.\n\nJust a couple of blocks away from the gardens,\
  \ at SusiZanmai, a regular helped me order a sashimi nigiri sushi set of \"luxury\
  \ and indulgence\" which cost $41 and was worth every yen. When I became mildly\
  \ lost in Chinatown, local teens guided me back to the Yokohama New Grand Hotel.\
  \ They had as little English as I had Japanese, but we communicated our ages and\
  \ names and even my occupation. Language barriers? No worries. There are always\
  \ Japanese locals around who will help you.\n\nAutumn in Japan is sunny, breezy\
  \ and a little rainy \u2014 with a late-summer heat lingering in the background.\
  \ On a perfect day we visited the Sankeien Gardens, considered among the finest\
  \ in Japan, and participated in a tea ceremony. The afterword of the instructional\
  \ pamphlet struck me as an endearing message to the anxious foreigner; \"We hope\
  \ you have a feeling of tranquillity. Was it stressful?\"\n\nOishii, meaning \"\
  delicious\", is a very handy word to have in Yokohama. At lunch, a chef prepared\
  \ oishii wagyu sirloin steak before my eyes at Seryna Steak Dome. The historic restaurant\
  \ overlooks Bashamichi, the first Western-style boulevard in Japan. For dinner,\
  \ I feasted on Cantonese food on the two-hour Royal Wing Yokohama dinner cruise,\
  \ taking in the Minato Mirai skyline and the Yokohama Bay Bridge as the sun slowly\
  \ drained from the sky.\n\nSeryna Steak Dome, in Yokohama. Photo / Eleanor Barker\n\

  \ Oktoberfest was in full swing, a taste of the festivities planned for rugby fans\
  \ this time next year. In the square, throngs of people were enjoying a drink in\
  \ the enormous beer tents or relaxing in the Red Brick Park. If you're less of a\
  \ beer fan you'll want to take your time exploring the themed floors of artisan\
  \ shops in the Red Brick Warehouses.\n\nMy pick of the souvenirs is \"replica food\"\
  \ \u2014 convincing faux food items that many Japanese restaurants display in their\
  \ restaurant windows. There is also real food to consume, local specialities like\
  \ omelette rice, local vege-packed ramen Sanma men, Kiyoken shumai \"famous shumai\
  \ dumpling bento lunch box\" or Bashamichi ice cream.\n\nOn our way out of Red Brick\
  \ Square we spotted a local man walking his pet meerkat - and it took a liking to\
  \ me. I left with the best travel photo ever and the sense that all sorts of wonderful\
  \ things can happen in this city."
