Text: "His words, the recorded words of my great grandfather fill the car as we drive\
  \ past the fields of greens and golds. There aren\u2019t fences here, nothing to\
  \ trap in or keep out. There are still men in these fields, still hundreds upon\
  \ hundreds of them tangled among the corn and potatoes. Fertilizing the ground.\
  \ They are still finding them. Farmers plowing fields finding arms bones and legs\
  \ bones. Discard like stones Unnamed, unidentified. \n\nMy great grandfather\u2019\
  s voice is just as I imagined, old and strong and proud. Still with his English\
  \ accent but worn down from his small-town New Zealand life. At home I see the land\
  \ he ploughed, on my drive to school, I like to wonder where his thoughts would\
  \ have drifted on those lonely frosted mornings, what stories he could have shared\
  \ in silent companionship with the dogs and the cattle. Now as I see where he fought,\
  \ his words seem so far away from the places we stop to see. \n\nWe were the same\
  \ age, only 17 when he went to war. The boys at school, my brother could have gone.\
  \ In the museum there are pictures, portraits of solders. From different battalions,\
  \ countries, parts of the world. But they all look the same. Young, brave and hopeful.\
  \ I want to warn them, tell them of their fate. What going to war actually means.\
  \ But it\u2019s no use, they would do it all again, still do it now. The sense of\
  \ pride and honor in serving, is blinding. At that age boys are bullet proof, invincible.\
  \ Already too late when they realize they are not. \n\nThe cemeteries start to blur,\
  \ a rush of whites and greens as if we didn\u2019t even get out of the car to walk\
  \ through them. It\u2019s too hard to imagine that each of these stones represents\
  \ a person, a family mourning. I feel like a jar filled up, water keeps flowing\
  \ but it doesn\u2019t have the capacity to hold it anymore.  They must have stop\
  \ feeling. Or buried it deep within themselves. A soldier\u2019s mind must have\
  \ had to be cleaned, as you would a gun to prepare for battle.  Wiping everything\
  \ away, leaving it, more or less, spotless.\n\nMy nana came on this trip with me,\
  \ for me. Great grandad wasn\u2019t even on her side of the family. Nana is very\
  \ proud of our family, our history. I never really cared for history, before this\
  \ trip. I took it in high school for a bit, it felt so far away, all written by\
  \ old men. I didn\u2019t like that you just had to spit facts, couldn\u2019t change\
  \ the story to sound more beautiful or exciting. But there are so many stories,\
  \ I\u2019m realizing that now. Everyone has a story and they are all life changing.\
  \ \n\nShe sits in the front, my nana, gives the directions. Map sprawled across\
  \ the dash, road running like rivers on to her lap. She is always outspoken, the\
  \ first to comment, question, complain. But here she is quiet, speaks in whispers.\
  \ Alan came to, my dad\u2019s cousin. He is the reason I am here, the reason we\
  \ know so much. Alan sat in front of great-granddad at my age and asked for the\
  \ recordings. Wanted to go to Europe and visit the battle sights. Without his curiosity\
  \ all of this knowledge would have been lost. He drives, speaking to nana under\
  \ his breath, words like wind whistle through to the back of the car, but I can\u2019\
  t catch them they fly out the open window. \n\nI spoke at the Anzac Day service,\
  \ at home before I came. Spoke the words of my great granddad into the micropore.\
  \ They washed over the crowd, bouncing back at me off buildings. They caught me\
  \ off guard, his words, the power they hold. They brought tears to the eyes of my\
  \ great uncle, his son. They brought me to this country. Are the reason we are all\
  \ in this car. The reason I stand where he stood, 100 years later, reading the words\
  \ he spoke. They are so much greater than his thoughts,this moment, or this trip.\
  \ Greater than he ever could have expected."
