Text: "Glancing at a diagram of the island and attempting to find road signs to point\
  \ us in the right direction, I realized my navigating had gotten us lost. My travel\
  \ buddy, Nick, laughed while snatching the map out of my hands to study it as dozens\
  \ of dairy cows temporarily blocked our path in the road. \n\nThe Chainsmokers\u2019\
  \ Paris was playing as we cruised around the winding roads looking for the small\
  \ brownish-black arrows labeled with three words in white ink: Algar do Carv\xE3\
  o. \n\nFeeling excitedly-lost was the theme of the trip. We were 930 miles off the\
  \ coast of Portugal and 2,400 miles off the east coast of North America. Dropped\
  \ in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean are nine islands (The Azores) that are under-appreciated\
  \ as a tourist destination. One of the larger islands, Terceira, covers about 148\
  \ sq. miles. \n\nThe center of the island is home to Algar do Carv\xE3o. It contains\
  \ dormant volcanic caves created from an eruption over 2000 years ago. The location\
  \ allows you to literally explore an extinct volcano. Which was what we were trying\
  \ to do prior to the map ending up in my hands. \n\nGetting back on track we tried\
  \ to decide how we could describe the current view to family and friends. The verdict?\
  \ Jurassic Park. The tree line and vegetation lining the road was so thick it created\
  \ a darkness convincing enough to be midnight. Both of us expected to see a dinosaur\
  \ climb into our path.\n\nOur destination was a small parking lot capable of holding\
  \ about 50 vehicles. The sky was full of low, grey clouds and a light mist was glistening\
  \ the landscape around us. Headed towards the entrance we realized we were the only\
  \ vehicle and people in the area. \n\nThe door was emerald green with a large square\
  \ grid containing three documents. The top left-hand corner listed the contact information\
  \ for the organization responsible for maintenance of the cave. Below that was a\
  \ short list of visitor rules and expectations. On the right hand side was a vertical\
  \ flyer highlighting the lava caves and volcano we were dying to explore. This flyer\
  \ taunted us with photos and listed hours of operations: they were closed Monday.\
  \ Today was, of course, Monday. \n\nLaughing at ourselves, we journeyed back to\
  \ Angra do Hero\xEDsmo. We spent the afternoon walking the wet cobblestone streets\
  \ passing local shops, incredible churches and perfect caf\xE9s before settling\
  \ down for one of Portugal\u2019s best-selling beers, Super Bock, and fried potato\
  \ skins for dinner. \n\nThe next day we relived our driving journey with ease. As\
  \ we walked back up to the entrance, neither of us knew what to expect as we headed\
  \ into the gift shop to purchase our tickets. \n\nDoors opened into the wet stone\
  \ entrance lit with torches hanging on the wall. The sound of water hitting the\
  \ uneven ground below us followed the echoes in the hallway leading us into the\
  \ volcano. Another door opened and both of us gasped as Nick turned on the GoPro\
  \ strapped to his forehead. \n\nStairs led to a platform 150 feet below us; above\
  \ us, the former chimney of the volcano allowed natural light and rain to fall over\
  \ us. Moss, vines and vegetation added life to a previously dark and deadly threat.\
  \ Water trickled down the walls and the smell of sulfur lingered as we descended\
  \ down the stairs to the platform. \n\nOverwhelmed with the beauty around me, my\
  \ eyes filled with tears as I stood in a place once filled with angry magma. I could\
  \ imagine magma rolling from side-to-side and studied the veins and craters it left\
  \ in the walls each one telling a different story. A second set of stairs led me\
  \ down another 150 feet to a rainfed lake. \n\nStanding in the base of this extinct\
  \ volcano, next to a lake created by the same rainwater I felt hitting the top of\
  \ my head, I realized how much this hidden gem reminded me of us as individuals.\
  \ Unknown to those around us, we are small but mighty. We tell stories of pain and\
  \ anger hoping the unknown ending will be beautifully created. And we\u2019re dying\
  \ to be found."
