Text: "He started by saying \"let's go to the USA, I can work and you continue your\
  \ studies there\". That moment I forgave him, I forgot all the pain and struggles\
  \ I faced when he wasn\u2019t around. I forgot that he left me for 16 Year and decided\
  \ to give him a second chance and we traveled together, this is my father. It all\
  \ started when I was four years old, my parents agreed to get divorced; I was a\
  \ young kid who didn't understand the meaning of divorce or separation, my main\
  \ concern at that time was to watch Barney and sleep. Then after all those years\
  \ he came back into the picture, apologizing for not being there, defending himself\
  \ and saying that my mom was the reason, and he decided to vanish from my life.\
  \ In these years he started a new family and had kids. So he came back asking for\
  \ forgiveness and to give him another chance in a different country. I was so happy\
  \ that I finally saw my father after I lived all these years without him; not knowing\
  \ what is the meaning of the word father.\n\nAt first I was fascinated by the USA\
  \ and what a beautiful country it is I felt as if I belonged, the people were very\
  \ nice and welcoming, the weather was chill and pure, the nature there was amazing\
  \ the stars were very bright and shiny at night .But, i only spent 7 good days with\
  \ him! Until one day I was in my room, about to sleep and i felt a very bad pain\
  \ in my breast, so i ignored it and slept; but after a couple of hours i woke up\
  \ crying and screaming from the pain, I ran to him and told him I can't take my\
  \ breath the pain is indescribable! He smiled and said what a sassy girl you are\
  \ and slept. At that moment I felt as if someone slapped me really hard on my face,\
  \ I started crying harder not from the pain but because he disappointed me again.\
  \ I went upstairs, changed my clothes and went to the nearest hospital; I did the\
  \ ultrasounds and everything. \n\nThat was the hardest moment, am in a foreign country,\
  \ all alone in the hospital, I was hungry tired and without a father as usual. And\
  \ then the doctor came in and told me \"I think you have inferior cancer\" there\
  \ was silence for 10 seconds; he then asks if I have anyone around? And my answer\
  \ was no! Then he asked why? At that moment I burst into tears like a little baby\
  \ who lost her new toy and can't find it anymore. I left the hospital knowing that\
  \ i have to come back tomorrow to do the rest of the scans and i was very terrified,\
  \ not knowing what to do or who to call. I went back home and he was lying on the\
  \ couch watching television then he looked at me and asked, so what happened? I\
  \ told him what the doctor said and he replied in a very careless tone, \"doctors\
  \ tend to jump into conclusions, no worries dear\u201D, by the way he\u2019s a physician!!!\n\
  \nI silently went to my room wondering what if I have cancer? Will I die? Is that\
  \ the end? But i woke up the next day and went to the hospital all alone, did my\
  \ scans and the doctor said the results will be out after four days! In these four\
  \ days I couldn't sleep, then the big day came and the results were out. I was all\
  \ frightened and shaking from the inside but what i didn't expect to find was that\
  \ it was a benign tumor, I was relieved and calm. Until the doctor said you have\
  \ to do a surgery to remove it, however, my dad didn\u2019t even want to pay for\
  \ the surgery. \n\n\nSo, I left him in the USA and came back home, I did the surgery\
  \ and was surrounded by my beloved family and friends. Although it was a very hard\
  \ phase, it passed, leaving me stronger and wiser\n\nBut, am sorry father I can't\
  \ forgive you anymore."
