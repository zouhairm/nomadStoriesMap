Text: "A few years back, I travelled to Kenya as part of a voluntary project. I'm\
  \ vegan, and like many others in the v-gang, exploring new places is synonymous\
  \ with exploring the local vegan food scene. I wasn't holding out much hope for\
  \ my culinary adventures in Kenya, but almost as soon as I touched down on Kenyan\
  \ soil, I started to chomp my naive assumptions away. It turns out that a huge majority\
  \ of Kenyan meals are 'accidentally vegan' - they just happen not to contain, or\
  \ need, any animal products. Even the most carnivorous among our group stuffed themselves\
  \ with sukuma (kale or collard greens), dug into githeri (a delicious mixture of\
  \ corn and beans) and happily munched on meals that were 100% vegan. Here's a sneak\
  \ peak virtual taste test of the most scrumptious trip I ever took. \n\nA disclaimer\
  \ should be made that whilst in Kenya, I stayed with a host family and total gratitude\
  \ goes to my chef extraordinaire host Mum Winny, without whom my experience would\
  \ have been no way near as tasty \u2013 thanks Mum! I knew I liked Winny from the\
  \ very first breakfast she made us. Tucking into vegan pancakes \u2013 that's vegan\
  \ as standard, no adjustments made - I immediately became a convert to Kenyan cuisine.\
  \ The word pancake here might be slightly misleading \u2013 they're not thin and\
  \ delicate like the french crepe or soft, fat and fluffy like the american variety.\
  \ Instead, they've got a glorious sweet stodginess to them and I would choose them\
  \ one hundred times over their counterparts. What's more, Kenyans know how to spice\
  \ up their pancakes and keep your taste buds on their toes. Winny grated lime zest\
  \ into our first batch and each mouthful was pure sweet and tangy bliss. Our pancakes\
  \ the following morning \u2013 we were very spoilt \u2013 had grated carrot and\
  \ lemon inside. That's my two favourite cake flavours in pancake form. All my dreams\
  \ were coming true.  \n\nKenyan dinner is a carb fest like you've never seen before.\
  \ It was pretty standard to have spaghetti, rice and potatoes and for no one to\
  \ bat an eyelid. While I'd never been particularly fussed by rice, Winny made it\
  \ taste like the food of the Gods and those fluffy little grains left me feeling\
  \ on top of the world. But none of these dominated the dining table quite like the\
  \ controversial and group-dividing ugali. Ugali is a starchy polenta-y, porridge-y\
  \ dish made by mixing maize flour with water, and playfully labelled as 'Kenyan\
  \ marmite' by our group leaders. Regardless of whether we loved it or hated it,\
  \ it was staple of our diet. Great hunky slabs of the stuff served as edible cutlery\
  \ - you pull off a piece, squidge it about then use it to scoop up rest of your\
  \ meal. There's a certain novelty to not using cutlery but if the rest of my food\
  \ was a bit on the sloppy side, I'd be left with my entire meal cemented to my hands.\
  \ Funnily enough, my host family never had this problem and weren't in a hurry to\
  \ share their secret. \n \nOne last shout out has to go to the humble orange veg-but-technically-fruit\
  \ that, in the UK, makes its annual appearance at the end of October \u2013 the\
  \ pumpkin! We picked ours from our garden (about as local as local produce gets),\
  \ cut it up, boiled it then fried it with onions and herbs. It was so good that\
  \ we had it again for breakfast the next day - and invited the neighbours around.\n\
  \nSo there you have it, veganism in Kenya is completely possible and entirely delicious.\
  \ Eating out was a breeze with no subbing out or swapping required and while I don't\
  \ think I brought (m)any Kenyans round to the vegan lifestyle, they also didn't\
  \ see it as that weird - hurray! \n\nSince my trip to Kenya, I've visited some top\
  \ vegan-friendly travel destinations. Sure, they've been tasty but I still find\
  \ myself daydreaming, and my heart and belly aching, for the food that I ate in\
  \ that small Kenyan town, which rightfully remains the title holder of my tastiest\
  \ travel experience to date."
