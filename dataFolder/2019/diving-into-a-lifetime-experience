Text: "Everything started in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In the Turkish consulate. I was about\
  \ to start an internship to work as en English teacher I'm Sakarya, small city in\
  \ Turkey. The Turkish consulate didn't want to give me the visa because the document\
  \ the company sent wasn't readable. I talked to the president of the company and\
  \ she said: it's ok, we can solve it here. \nThen Sao Paulo, airplane, Casablanca,\
  \ airplane, Istanbul. Turkey was a cultural shok. Starting by the strong accent\
  \ while talking to the immigration officer and, after that, Turkish language itself.\
  \ It's completely different from everything I've experienced so far. When I left\
  \ Brazil I thought: speaking three languages will help me communicate with people.\
  \ But it didn't. Traveling from Istanbul to Sakarya I was listening to people speaking\
  \ and I couldn't understand a word, it was like life was teaching me how to be humble\
  \ and saying: you don't know anything yet kid. \nArriving in Sakarya a mountain\
  \ of unforseen situation started falling upon me. The first day in the city I had\
  \ problem with accommodation. The country fell into a deep financial crises and\
  \ the deal I had flew out in the wind. The owner wanted to charge more because I\
  \ was a foreigner in his country then we had no deal. After that I find someone\
  \ to share the house with but he tried to deceive me twice, asking for.money and\
  \ using the \"current Turkish laws\" as a shield. \nBut the real problem started\
  \ when the school that hired me cancelled the contract. The government didn't approve\
  \ the pedagogical plan so they couldn't open. So I left my country with a contract,\
  \ a deal for accommodation and in fifteen days I had nothing. All of this happened\
  \ in the middle of a very important religious holiday (but I was so upset that I\
  \ didn't even ask the name of it) and I had to wait for twelve days until someone\
  \ could solve the problem. Meanwhile I found someone to share the house with but\
  \ this one had hundreds in debts he didn't pay. We were out of gas so it was cold\
  \ shower and no cooking. All the money I had for emergencies went for food (which\
  \ became an emergency). \nAfter the holiday I signed a twenty-five hour contract\
  \ with a kindergarten school and it became another problem. This twenty-five hours\
  \ became forty against my own will. Fifty minutes class became two hours class and\
  \ teaching turned into nursing. I wasn't ready for that. By the end of the month\
  \ I was waiting for my payment, that didn't come. Then I asked my boss and, after\
  \ asking, it took another ten days to get paid. Next month the same, and again,\
  \ and again. Finally I decided to cut a deal and left the school. \nWhile is was\
  \ fighting to get paid, I was trying to find another place to live. Lucky I was\
  \ because I made good friends there and here's something interesting: all of them\
  \ were foreigners. Iraq, Algeria, Palestine, Venezuela, Colombia, Georgia, Egypt.\
  \ These people helped me when I was lost over there. \nI still remember the fastest\
  \ job interview I ever had and a new job. And it was amazing. The principal was\
  \ a good man and the coordinator was a really good person. I was finally recovering\
  \ my happiness and my will to keep teaching. I was working in a good place, with\
  \ good kids and a good team. I found friends to share an apartment with and everything\
  \ was cool. But, then again, I was wrong.\nOne morning I got a warning about my\
  \ situation in the country, my Visa had expired. The information they gave me in\
  \ Sao Paulo wasn't correct. Once again my contract was broken and I had to leave\
  \ the country. When I left my country I imagined a good experience, learning new\
  \ people, new language but it was problems over problems but I never learned more\
  \ in such few time. I learned about the history in the middle East, I learned about\
  \ Muslims, I had the opportunity to make great friends and know new places. It was\
  \ a good lesson in the end."
