Text: "\u201CSalaam Sadiq, I am Youssef.\u201D But the tone was contemptuously insouciant,\
  \ belying the formal courtesy of the greeting.  \nHis eyes hid behind Ray-Bans reflecting\
  \ the fierce glare. His leathered face was as fissuredd as the surrounding cliffs.\
  \ Having weighed and found me wanting, the glasses shifted to consider the camp\
  \ stores in the back of the Hilux. \n\u201CWe are broke down since yesterday and\
  \ have no water or food. Perhaps you can help fellow travellers.\u201D \nIt was\
  \ a statement, not a question. It was not a matter for dispute.\nHis hand brushed\
  \ my own momentarily, without sincerity, before moving like a scorpion across the\
  \ storage containers in the Hilux\u2019s cargo well.   \nThis was the desert; survival\
  \ may depend on the assistance of strangers. It is the very essence of the timeless\
  \ convention between travellers. \n\u201CWe can let you have water. And take one\
  \ of you to get help with the truck.\u201D I offered.   \nBut he ignored me. \n\u201C\
  You have many provisions! But we are poor men and cannot afford to pay you for the\
  \ food we need.\u201D\nUnder his black and white chequered keffiyeh, he spoke a\
  \ clear, incongruously archaic English. Perhaps he was a fan of old Hollywood movies:\
  \ had learned like Ashley Wilkes not to give a damn. And like Errol Flynn I suspected\
  \ he would always let you down. \n\u201CIt\u2019s prudent to expect the unexpected.\u201D\
  \ I said, regretting my stupidity for not having followed my own advice by stopping.\
  \ \nWe were returning from a Hash House Harrier meet; desert running in the comparative\
  \ coolness of early Spring. We were now stopped by the abandoned grey hillbilly\
  \ truck blocking the trail to the towering columns of the Tuwaiq escarpment a few\
  \ miles beyond. \nTo the right a fork in the rutted trail rose between sedimentary\
  \ walls, cresting after 50 yards. \nWe stopped, and several men emerged from hiding,\
  \ surrounding the Hilux. Dressed like Youssef in gutterahs, shirts, and sirwals,\
  \ bare feet splayed in battered chapaals. They were hard-eyed men, living in the\
  \ wild.\nMade uneasy by their sudden appearance, their exclamations and low whispered\
  \ conversation when they saw the girls in the cab heightened my apprehension. \n\
  In Saudi Arabia men do not see unveiled women in public, foreign workers in the\
  \ remote quarries and construction camps of the Wadi Hanifa would not see a woman\
  \ for months, even years at a time, let alone two attractive blonde, blue-eyed Europeans.\n\
  And we were alone and unarmed at this desolate, empty fork in the trail. \nI saw\
  \ the girls\u2019 angry, concerned faces in the cab. Had they locked the doors?\
  \  I wondered,  vainly, how we would get out of this trap.\n\nWithout warning, two\
  \ Landcruisers roared over the crest. They stopped beside us. Armed police leaped\
  \ out, shouting and pointing weapons. Forcing the men face down on the ground they\
  \ were searched and chained. A small pile of weapons included knives and an automatic\
  \ pistol concealed in Youssef\u2019s waistband.\nThe serious young police captain\
  \ in smart khaki fatigues and peaked cap came over.  \u201CIgama!\u201D He barked,\
  \ without preamble. \n\u201CBe on your way.\u201D He said, studiously ignoring the\
  \ girls. Before I could speak, he held up his hand to silence me.\n\u201CConsider\
  \ yourself lucky.\u201D He added, handing my Igama back. \u201CWe were hidden, watching\
  \ them. They\u2019ve been robbing travellers for weeks. And worse.\u201D he said,\
  \ looking meaningfully at the girls.\n\u201CWhat will happen to them?\u201D I asked\n\
  \u201CPrison, if they are lucky, deportation back to Yemen.\u201D \nTo Saudis criminals\
  \ are always foreigners, never fellow Saudis. \nHe pointed at Youssef, \u201CHe\
  \ raped and killed a woman, so\u2026\u201D he graphically drew his outstretched\
  \ palm across his throat.  \n\u201CMy sergeant wants me to arrest you all. You have\
  \ broken the Sharia being unchaperoned with these women. But I have better things\
  \ to do, this time. You would not enjoy prison or the attentions of the Religious\
  \ Police. \nI hope you have learned not to travel alone again. The Nejd is a dangerous\
  \ place for the foolish and unwary.\nMay Allah protect you on your journey\u201D\
  .\n\u201CShukran, Captain, truly we are very grateful for your timely assistance.\
  \ And wah-alaikum-Salaam.\u201D I replied with understated feeling, climbing with\
  \ relief into the cab."
