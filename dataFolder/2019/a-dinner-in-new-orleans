Text: "October 2018: New Orleans: \nMy girlfriend Catherine and I travelled to New\
  \ Orleans. We both love live music and wanted to see a truly unique place in America.\
  \ We are Canadians from Ottawa, and we decided to go and see what this intriguing,\
  \ music-loving city of New Orleans was about. I sought a lot of recommendations\
  \ and one specific recommendation that stood out from the pack all was for us to\
  \ check out Kermit Ruffins\u2019s Mother-In-Law-Lounge. I had never heard of it,\
  \ but it came up more than once. \nOn our last night we were very, painfully hungry.\
  \ I promised Catherine a lavish, full, expensive dinner with all the fixins\u2019\
  .  I did not know where that would be, but I imagined we would get this lavish dinner\
  \ when went to the establishment known as \u201CKermit Ruffins\u2019s Mother-In-Law\
  \ Lounge.\u201D We did not know much about it, so we figured we\u2019d eat there.\
  \ It was the last place on our list. \nWhen we got there, we came across a wonderful\
  \ environment. We were immersed in what was a large backyard; many picnic tables;\
  \ patio lanterns; lots of jovial people; with a huge stage. \nWe were the only two\
  \ Caucasian people there, and were a tad overdressed in my collared shirt and Catherine\u2019\
  s fancy dress. Everyone was African-American and dressed casual and comfortable.\
  \ \nWe sat on the exterior of a picnic table, open to the crowd and stage, in which\
  \ the 13-piece brass band played a joyful and rousing series of Motown covers, the\
  \ most notable being \u201CJust My Imagination\u201D by the Temptations. Everyone\
  \ was dancing to their hearts content. Dancing so freely and inspiringly and again:\
  \ jovially!  \nOur stomachs were growling when the sweet, young southern belle server\
  \ came up to us to take our order. We ordered two Coronas, and then asked her for\
  \ menus. A standard, perfunctory exercise; or so we thought!  \nThat was went it\
  \ came: \nThe server said in her southern drawl: \u201CAw: Honey: you in Kermit\
  \ Ruffins place\u2026 ain\u2019t no menus here!!\u201D She said with aplomb. I said:\
  \ \u201CPardon?\u201D She smiled: \u201CHoney\u2026you and you beauty here with\
  \ you, y\u2019all gonna eat what everyone else is enjoying, and that\u2019d be Kermit\u2019\
  s own spicy turkey. Which y\u2019all is gonna serve yourselves when all ya\u2019\
  ll head over to that cooler over there! And when ya\u2019ll do that, I\u2019ll be\
  \ back with Coronas!\u201D \nShe pointed enthusiastically, to a nearby picnic table\
  \ with a tall blue cooler sitting on its dining end. I moseyed over.  \nThere was\
  \ some more info the server had sweetly glossed over, that soon became clear: \n\
  Eating nothing but the only thing available: SPICY TURKEY. It was on the picnic\
  \ table, with no ladle or utensils of any kind. That meant I had to get it and slop\
  \ it onto the paper plates, and then eat the whole thing, by-hand-and-knuckle; straight\
  \ from the cooler. As had everyone else! There were no apologies to be made, because\
  \ it was the beautiful unquestioned norm. \n\u201CGo with the Flow\u201D will never\
  \ sound the same again! \nOnce we forcibly got over the utensil- and option-less\
  \ eating procedural: It was delicious and filling!! \nWe went for seconds!  \nThis\
  \ was how I treated Catherine, my girlfriend, for dinner when I had promised her\
  \ a big, lavish dinner all that day. It was certainly memorable!  \nThe environment\
  \ and music was so awesome and friendly and race had no space in this lovely place.\
  \ \nEveryone danced with such passion and talent and freedom; it was reminiscent\
  \ of Tom Petty\u2019s warm line: \u201CI got a Room at the Top of the World tonight.\
  \ Where everyone can have a drink and forget those things that went wrong.\u201D\
  \ I remember leaving feeling like it was the warmest place in the World. \u201C\
  Why can\u2019t THIS be the \u2018America\u2019 I see on the news??\u201D we asked.\
  \ There was a message hand-painted on the street curb just outside of Kermit Ruffin\u2019\
  s place that wonderfully read: \u201CTry imagining a place where it\u2019s always\
  \ safe & warm.\u201D It was. \nComically, jovially, and with no metaphor, though:\
  \ I literally scraped the bottom of the barrel, with my dragging, scraping, digging\
  \ fingertip, for dinner that night, and loving Catherine was a good sport about\
  \ it!\n- Simon Seline"
