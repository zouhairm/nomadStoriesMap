Text: 'On summer vacations I went to the United States with my sister, first we were
  in San Diego and in Los Angeles, but both are cities we had already been in, so
  we decided to travel to another place we would never have gone, finally we got very
  cheap flights to Reno, so we decided to go and explore.


  As soon as we got to the city, we realized that there were many homeless, hotels
  that looked seedy, people who seemed to be drugged, did not feel safe being in the
  streets and when we entered a supermarket many products like shampoo, deodorants,
  rakes, etc. they were under lock, as we need several things we solicited to someone
  to give us the products and we took the opportunity to ask


  -Why do you have so many products under lock? there are many thefts?-

  - Yes, we do not want to have things like that because it is uncomfortable for those
  who buy, but we have to do it.-


  Being from Mexico, we always thought that in general in the United States we would
  feel more secure, but it was not like that, we were afraid to leave the hotel and
  explore the streets, and although we did, we were very careful.


  In Reno people mentioned that Lake Tahoe was very nice and it was only an hour and
  a half from the city, so after discussing it we decided to go, we went by car, almost
  when we arrived, we stopped down the mountain, on the side of road, because the
  view impressed us, I had never seen anything like it, and we did not expect what
  we saw.


  After several photos and be there for a while, we went down the mountain and arrived
  at the lake, I am a very cold person so I did not want to enter the water, but I
  ended up doing it because it would be my only chance, once inside I did not want
  to leave, because although the water was freezing, I felt happy, seeing the trees,
  and the mountains full of snow, it was like the scene of a movie, with an extraordinary
  view and I wanted to be there as long as possible, so that the sensation and the
  Memory will linger in my memory.


  I tell this because with this trip I realized that both the United States, Mexico
  and other countries are not just one thing, they are complex, they have problems,
  but at the same time they are beautiful and that is why it is interesting to travel
  to each of these, to know in depth places in order to build a better understanding
  of the culture, of the people and their difficulties.'
