Text: "Friday, November 2010, the blue night turned into bloody red in the north.\
  \ \u201CKentongan\u201D (a traditional wooden alarm) was beaten continuously from\
  \ the distance, representing the heartbeat of the people of Cangkringan. 15 kilometers\
  \ from the district, Mount Merapi showed her power. \u201CThe Sacred Great Lady\u201D\
  \ was roaring, diffusing with the scream of men. Women and children were crying.\
  \ All prayed for the best, between life and death. The great eruption of Merapi\
  \ had killed hundreds of people, wiped away hundreds of villages; slaughtered thousands\
  \ of cattle, with millions of material lost.\n\nMy journey was no picnic at all.\
  \ Riding 25 kilometers from Yogyakarta, I finally reached the ground zero early\
  \ morning. I was surprised by the damage Merapi had caused. Tons of volcanic material\
  \ buried everything within its path: houses, schools, mosques, farming areas, even\
  \ rivers. Merapi had painted the areas into a grey desert. Trees remained their\
  \ grey trunks. Leaves were all burnt, blanketed by tephra. I didn\u2019t recall\
  \ the area where I spent my childhood. Next to my feet, I found a roof of a Javanese\
  \ traditional building and soon realized that I was actually standing up on the\
  \ top of a school building. \n\nAs I felt volcanic dust burnt my feet, I began to\
  \ move my step to the lower ground. The smell of the deceased was stronger. Beside\
  \ the horror, I was fascinated by Merapi\u2019s purest form after the eruption let\
  \ up. Because of the piles of the materials, the ground level raised about 100 meters.\
  \ Thus, the peak of Merapi seemed to be dramatically \u201Ccloser.\u201D It was\
  \ a great catastrophe but it couldn\u2019t be denied that Merapi had showed her\
  \ most breathtaking figure. The sky was clear blue and the ash was soaring high,\
  \ red-and orange as the sunrise hit it.\n\nI returned to Cangkringan 8 years later.\
  \ Merapi has given her bless. The grey land has changed into the ever-green land.\
  \ Trees were growing; houses, mosques, and school were rebuilt. The land has been\
  \ naturally fertilized. I\u2019d love to call Cangkringan as \u2018The Living Museum\u2019\
  \ for the history that is kept by all the places and the people dwelling there.\n\
  \nAs one of the most active volcano in Indonesian Ring of Fire, Merapi is still\
  \ surrounded by villages; making it one of the most perilous tourist destinations.\
  \ Yet, would the visitors aware of the danger? \n\nNanda, my cousin and my guide,\
  \ was 12 when the big eruption happened. Haunted by the fear of the disaster, Nanda\
  \ would feel alarmed whenever hearing the roar of a jeep, or the rice mil. He joins\
  \ a community which always informs the update of Merapi\u2019s volcanic activity.\
  \ They are aware of any potential dangers: the growth of the lava dome, the volcanic\
  \ quake, the cold lava flood, or the pouring ashflows. \n\nThe community provides\
  \ Nanda a lesson about disaster mitigation. He quickly learns what to do if the\
  \ eruption happens and where to go. He also learns how to read the natural sign\
  \ whenever the volcanic activities increase. The growth of the lava dome, which\
  \ is possible to observe bare eyes from Kaliadem gives warning: the eruption might\
  \ happen in short time. \n\nThe animal\u2019s behavior is also a sign. The volcanic\
  \ activity might also disturb the radio signal. So, whenever the radio buzzes, he\
  \ knows he has to run. Although the eruption cannot be accurately predicted, the\
  \ signs give early warning to close off the area.\n\nDisaster mitigation is something\
  \ precious the visitors should get from the guide. As for me, riding motorcycle\
  \ with Nanda, recalling the area of Kaliadem, observing the peak while sipping local\
  \ coffee, were like making connection between me and Merapi. The Sacred Great Lady,\
  \ which was once showing her rage, was sitting solemnly before us. Nanda and the\
  \ people of Cangkringan never mean to be a daredevil who offers an extreme adventure\
  \ to the visitors. They rather tell us how to live side by side and respect the\
  \ nature. Despite the saying \u201Cmother nature is a cruel mistress,\u201D Merapi\u2019\
  s solitude will certainly give us the sign of warning. The lesson that only the\
  \ humblest may understand and finally survive."
