Text: "Dehradun is likely not on your travel itinerary. \n\nThe once sleepy Indian\
  \ town is now the bustling, overcrowded capital city of Uttarakhand. Tourist attractions\
  \ are scarce. Known for its boarding schools, research institutes and army bases,\
  \ Dehradun is also a gateway city to the more scenic Mussorrie and the spiritual\
  \ Rishikesh.\n\nBut one of the town\u2019s attractions is worth a stopover. Nestled\
  \ in a small Tibetan colony at the southern tip of the city is the tranquil Mindrolling\
  \ Monastery (pronounced Minh-dro-lyng). Founded in 1965, the monastery schools over\
  \ 300 monks from the city\u2019s Tibetan refugee community.\n\nTibetan refugees\
  \ have long been settling in Dehradun since the 1950\u2019s. Neighboring hill station\
  \ Mussorrie was the Dalai Lama\u2019s first home when he escaped from Chinese controlled\
  \ Tibet in 1959. Since then, an estimated 150,000 Tibetans have left Tibet and now\
  \ call India home.\n\nAt the center of the vast monastery grounds is the Great Stupa,\
  \ a towering 185-foot white temple. Considered the largest stupa in the world, the\
  \ Great Stupa houses various Tibetan Buddhist art and relics. (Photography inside\
  \ the stupa is not allowed). Overlooking the entire park, near the top of the stupa\
  \ stands a gold depiction of Maitreya, a future Buddha who is to appear on Earth\
  \ to reteach Buddhist doctrines.\n\nGuarding the western area of the monastery is\
  \ a 115 foot gold statue of Buddha, erected in dedication to the Dalai Lama. The\
  \ statue is encircled by what seems like 100\u2019s of prayer wheels, whose spins\
  \ are believed to bring blessings. \n\nThe surrounding gardens house other temples,\
  \ stupas, and relics but are also home to many visitors relishing in the serenity\
  \ of the monastery. Teenage students lounge on the grass near the stupa, while young\
  \ monks quietly walk between buildings to attend classes. Construction workers restore\
  \ one of the nearby shrines without the slightest bit of disruption to the park\u2019\
  s silence.  And yet, just blocks away, the busy streets of Dehradun are blaring\
  \ with honking cars and shouting passersby.\n\nIf anything, the aptly named monastery\
  \ (Mindrolling means \u201CPlace of Perfect Emancipation\u201D) is worth a visit\
  \ for its art, its Tibetan culture, or just to escape India\u2019s chaotic streets."
