Text: "Bali, Indonesia. The day I\u2019m going to visit my friend. We both love adventures,\
  \ so we thought \u201Cwhy don\u2019t we try something new while we had a free time.\u201D\
  \ Destination has been set, Pura Lempuyang, East Bali.\n\nI strolled around Denpasar(Bali\u2019\
  s capital) a bit, waiting for her to finish her work. Sun just leave it\u2019s peak\
  \ hours, and thus begun our journey to the Temple (Pura means temple in Indonesian\
  \ language).\n\nRelying only with GPS, we drived for hours, occasionally stopping\
  \ a friendly local if we had the right direction. \u201CAlmost there,\u201D he said.\
  \ \n\nWe\u2019ve finally reached the lowest part of the temple, we parked our car,\
  \ and continue with foot to climb the thousand stairs of faith. \n\nWe\u2019ve met\
  \ several Balinese people during our walk, they always smile when encountering a\
  \ stranger. The taboo during this journey is we\u2019re not allowed to complaints\
  \ around the vicinity. So something like \u201CI\u2019m tired, it\u2019s too far,\
  \ I want to go home\u201D is forbidden to say.\n\nWe stopped a few times in the\
  \ checkpoint, which usually consist of a smaller temple and people praying. It\u2019\
  s good to met a friendly face during the journey.\n\nFinally, we reached our destination,\
  \ Pura Lempuyang Luhur, one of Bali\u2019s oldest and most highly regarded temples,\
  \ on par with Besakih.\n\nThe view is magnificent! We can see the clouds and the\
  \ village beneath, the breeze is cool and refreshing. A ritual is conducted in the\
  \ temple during our visit, so it\u2019s really calm in there. I like to watch a\
  \ traditional ritual of Balinese people, it\u2019s enlightening.\n\nWe rest a bit\
  \ then enjoying the scenery, it\u2019s breath taking! \n\nAfter talking with the\
  \ local to gain some knowledge, we decided it\u2019s time to leave. \n\nThe experience\
  \ is eye opening! Seeing many elderly doing the same walk of faith as us really\
  \ makes me think about their dedication to tradition. This is a one of kind experience\
  \ for me, I hope their traditions will live on with the next generation. Keep the\
  \ smile Bali!"
