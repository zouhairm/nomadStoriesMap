Text: "Alone, nervous and excited, I left the gentle - occasionaly brutal - warmth\
  \ of Nigeria's sun and headed to start a new life in Canada. \n\nThe decision to\
  \ move to a new country was a spontaneous one. The idea of learning and appreciating\
  \ a new culture, environment and meeting new people was such a thrill! I had to\
  \ do my curiosity a favor by jumping on this opportunity so on the night of new\
  \ year's eve, i got on a plane to my new home. New year, new me eh?\n\nSitting by\
  \ the window seat, i vividly recall watchin little specks of snow fall as the plane\
  \ landed. Upon my arrival, i got a cab to my accomodation, dressed in warm clothes\
  \ and stood in the snow. In that moment, the feeling of experiencing snow for the\
  \ first time eased my anxieties. There and then, adrenaline began to rush through\
  \ me; i was ready to take on the world (Canada) one new experience at a time.\n\n\
  The impromptu nature of my decision prevented me from making proper research about\
  \ my new environment. This, however, was no problem; I was excited to make new discoveries.\
  \ The following day, with no particular place in mind, i wandered around the quaint\
  \ city of Waterloo. Though it snowed still, the atmosphere was warm with laughter,\
  \ chatter and the smell of gravy drenched fries that i have come to love. The best\
  \ part about Waterloo, was how different groups of people (ranging from goths to\
  \ the skater kid to the tribal drummers who regularly hosted concerts at the public\
  \ square) peacefully co-exist and look out for each other. \n\nMy next stop was\
  \ the picturesque town named Baden; an old-fashioned city wih mormon churches, fields,\
  \ horse stables and open arms. For a few weeks, i got accustomed to the scent of\
  \ freshly mowed grass and the sounds of horses playfully snickering. Weekends were\
  \ especially great to look forward to because of the beautiful hymns that found\
  \ their way from the church to my bedroom window. Yet again, I moved to the city\
  \ i currently live in - Mississauga.\n\nMississauga is definitely different from\
  \ the first two cities. It is urban with lots of tall apartment buildings. It is\
  \ not as hospitable as people are often in cars and public areas are too busy to\
  \ stop and meet new people. I have not fully explored Mississauga yet though I regularly\
  \ take solo road-trips to neighboring cities. So far, the higlight of my Canadian\
  \ experiene has been meeting people from different ethnicities and backgrounds.\
  \ Multiculturalism is a major part of Canada's identity and people from all over\
  \ the world come here with their different histories. It has been great learning\
  \ and experiencing different cutures. I've eaten with Asians, cooked with Indians,\
  \ sang with Jamaicans and so much more. I've discovered new things about people\
  \ around me that have made me appreciate all their ways of life. \n\nThough Canada\
  \ is absolutely mazing, I can not wait to explore other countries of this beautiful\
  \ big world!"
