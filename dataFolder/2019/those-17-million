Text: "There are approximately 7.6 billion people in the world, and the chances of\
  \ being born where I did, are only 17.2 million; that means that there were 7, 582,\
  \ 800, 000 chances of having been born somewhere else. For many years, I asked the\
  \ universe, why it had put me in such a country. To the patriotic people, the land\
  \ of eternal spring and the nicest people in the world, to the world, the heart\
  \ of the Mayan world, and to me, a developing country where opportunities lack.\
  \ \u2018Why Guatemala?\u2019, I kept asking myself, even as I was already a week\
  \ into my project in Medellin. \n\nA couple of months before, I had joined AIESEC,\
  \ the biggest volunteering youth-run organization in the world. It took me a week\
  \ of dealing with international affairs in the organization to decide to do my volunteering\
  \ project in Colombia. Now that I was in Medellin, working with 30 people from 14\
  \ different countries, I was finally out and living! Foreseeing my struggle with\
  \ cultural shocks, I didn\u2019t imagine battling them; the most frustrating thing\
  \ would become to explain everything about Guatemala. It was annoying to explain\
  \ to Germans, Venezuelans, Slovaks, Italians, Peruvians, Colombians, Australians,\
  \ and even Mexicans what being part of those 17 million meant. \n\nPart of our job\
  \ in Medellin was making Global Villages which were well ornamented fairs where\
  \ we would showcase our countries, cultures and traditions. The anger I managed\
  \ to swallow when smaller-minded people called me Mexican built me up to spend five\
  \ hours cooking tortillas and a Guatemalan candy called \u2018canillitas-de-leche\u2019\
  \ for the last Village. The punchline is\u2026 I burned the canillitas and the tortillas\
  \ were made with other type of corn flour. As I exposed my culture to the children,\
  \ I swallowed tears once I looked down and saw the brown canillitas and the inflated\
  \ tortillas! The rage with which I defended my country, was fading.\n\n\u201CSomeone\
  \ call Sebas!\u201D, said one kid when they approached my stand dripping with sky\
  \ blue and white and weird Mayan particularities. Some kids pushed one little boy\
  \ from their class towards my stand and they all conglomerated around us. \u201C\
  This is Sebas, from Guatemala!\u201D, said one of his friends. \n\nThis time I couldn\u2019\
  t contain it and a tear streamed down my cheek. The kid seemed to be very loved\
  \ and his friends got excited as his bright eyes filled with nostalgia. We talked\
  \ for a bit, and by mere impulse and heat of the moment, I leaned and before he\
  \ left, I told him, \u201CSebas, don\u2019t ever forget where you come from\u201D\
  . I caught myself in a school in the middle of Medellin telling a kid that he should\
  \ be proud of having been born in such a picturesque and unique country... could\
  \ I be talking about something I didn\u2019t know of?\n\nOur last night in Medellin,\
  \ we partied like there was no tomorrow! Job was done, and all our flight tickets\
  \ sentenced us to go separate ways in less than 24 hours, but only then, I was certain\
  \ of three things: Colombia was amazing, I had met the best friends I would ever\
  \ have, and I could now make more sense to the lyrics of a particular song. \u2018\
  Guatemala your immortal name\u2019, I mouthed after sitting down drunk in the middle\
  \ of frolicking people. That song was my national anthem; an anthem that had never\
  \ made sense to me, but a year later these lyrics echoed as I climbed that tall\
  \ pyramid in Tikal. The horizon is broken by the tall temples that seem to be floating\
  \ in a green sea of trees. Guatemala was  perpetually  printed in my heart. The\
  \ immortal birthplace of culture, the majestic embodiment of beauty, and the most\
  \ truthful definition of kindness.  \n\nI never thought I would find my identity\
  \ amidst other cultures and traits!\n\n\nToday, I live in Frankfurt. Within the\
  \ stereotypical German introversion, I catch them muscling into my culture and heart.\
  \ Still, as I sit by the Main river looking at the sun set behind the skyscrapers,\
  \ I can\u2019t help but wonder, \u2018what did I do to deserve it? How did I get\
  \ so lucky to have been part of those 17 million?\u2019."
