Text: "I stick my hand into the Holy Water and make the sign of the cross as I genuflect.\
  \   As usual, I am late for Mass, but if the 40 minute qiche(long distance bus)\
  \ ride I took, followed by the 20 minute  gonggong qiche (short distance bus) ride\
  \ followed by the 5 min walk  from the bus stop doesn\u2019t provide me with a valid\
  \ reason I don\u2019t know what would. \n\nComing to university in China was certainly\
  \ a unique choice. I never imagined living in Asia, I wasn\u2019t obsessed with\
  \ the cuisine nor the language or even the culture like many people I had met so\
  \ far. I simply applied for a uni on a recommendation from a family friend and there\
  \ I was. \n\nOn first impression, Dalian is a peaceful and well-tended city, granted\
  \ my university was quite a distance away from the city centre in Lvshun, a mountainous\
  \ area by the beach. Luckily for us living so far away didn\u2019t affect us as\
  \ we had everything essential to millennial living- McDonald\u2019s, KFC, a mall\
  \ with a Walmart  surrounded by banks and even several museums, parks and karaoke\
  \ bars!. And most importantly reliable transport of every prince range into the\
  \ city! \n\nBut one thing was nagging at me, what about church?\n\nLike many people,\
  \ I had heard about the Communist attitude to religion and assumed the worst. I\
  \ left home not expecting to set foot in a church the entire time I would be in\
  \ China. I was pleased to be proved wrong. \n\nAutumn gave way to winter and the\
  \ hunt was postponed to resume in more explore friendly spring. \n\n           \
  \                                                                              \
  \               The hunt resumes\nAsking around doesn\u2019t yield the results I\
  \ expected. Other foreigners invited me to their Pentecostal Church on the 29th\
  \ Floor (claustrophobic by the way!) of the building behind the imposing Intercontinental\
  \ Hotel at the heart of Dalian city centre.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t easy to articulate\
  \ that it wasn\u2019t just a worship experience I was seeking but a home, a family,\
  \ a connection with something that had been part of my whole life up until that\
  \ point.\n\nThe campus is vibrant as everyone is excited for spring. The sun is\
  \ out and the campus is green and pregnant with possibility.  \n\n\u2018wo yao qu\
  \ jesu difang.\u2019  I said to the first cabby I saw.\n\n\u2018Yesu difang\u2019\
  \ is not conventional Chinese, literally translated it means \u2018Jesus place\u2019\
  \ not knowing the word for church I took advantage of how derivative and literal\
  \ Chinese is and tried my luck.\n\nIt paid off! The guy knew a church in Lvshun\
  \ and said he\u2019d take me there. \n\nDidn\u2019t quite know how to work Catholic\
  \ into the conversation, so I just figured I\u2018d see what kind it is when I get\
  \ there!\nSo off we went amid animated conversation on if he knew who Jesus was,\
  \ he did.\nI asked if he believed in him, he didn\u2019t.\n\nHe said he knew about\
  \ religion but he didn\u2019t have time to take whole days off to worship any of\
  \ them as he had money to make.  \nIt wasn\u2019t a Catholic church.  The services\
  \ where done for the day but the people there were no less welcoming.  \nThe church\
  \ was quite an imposing structure, it was built at the top of a very sandy hill\
  \ and was well decorated inside. I couldn\u2019t tell what denomination it was but\
  \ I asked the cabby to take a picture of all of us in front of the church none the\
  \ less.\n\n                                                                    \
  \                                    A Catholic Church is found\nFinally I decided\
  \ to be a modern about this and Google.  (Don\u2019t ask why I didn\u2019t start\
  \ here, I don\u2019t know either!)\nI was encouraged to see the address was in an\
  \ area I knew quite well.  \nAgain the next available Sunday I make my way there.\
  \  It\u2019s about 3 or 4 pm (I can never make it for the earlier Masses), there\u2019\
  s a very polite care taker who explains the church has moved to another location.\
  \ \nI decided right then I was done exploring for the day.  \nI took note of the\
  \ address to try again another Sunday."
