Text: "Usually Portugal or Portuguese is one of the names in Mozambique. But its soundness\
  \ not only from a political, economic and cultural point of view, but from the historical\
  \ point of view and with this opportunity to reproduce the tale and the Portuguese\
  \ reality I saw as an opportunity to relate the experiences welcomed with the elders\
  \ of the my community about Portuguese as an individual in the Mozambican context.\
  \ Porto Am\xE9lia is nowadays in the city of Pemba, the elders say that in the present\
  \ day, depending on the dynamics of life there, they choose to return to the stage\
  \ where the Portuguese colony reigned in their lives, claiming that there was more\
  \ respect and individuals. Most of us in young people reject it in the past and\
  \ do not even want to think about dividing what is ours with Portugal or Portuguese\
  \ because of the stories related to racism and slavery that we follow or have followed\
  \ in the Social Science or Stories manuals. If I could live the past, what would\
  \ I say tomorrow, is it an embarrassing imagination to describe how life has been\
  \ or is being complicated to the point that the elders now choose to go back in\
  \ time to forget or rectify tomorrow? What has remained behind on the good relationship\
  \ between Mozambican and Portuguese that history is not telling to those who do\
  \ not know the past or is simply a matter of not accepting the emergent transformations\
  \ in the communities in the present day? Since older people refer to the past as\
  \ saying things like: at the settler stage you would not do anything like that or\
  \ at your age you could not or could not do such actions. With so many embarrassments\
  \ about the past and the present, what would you say tomorrow about Portugal?"
