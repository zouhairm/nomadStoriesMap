Text: "The plane ride there I didn't feel as nervous as I thought I would. Being it\
  \ was my first plane ride ever, I would have thought otherwise. Excited mostly and\
  \ couldn't wait to explore what I had never imagined possible. It was my dream to\
  \ travel the world, and this was just the start.\n\nOnce I stepped off that plane\
  \ and walked into the airport, I immediately felt overwhelmed. A language I only\
  \ partly understood, signs I could read but couldn't follow, and nowhere to go.\
  \ We hadn't even booked a place to stay. During this time, I was with my mom, who\
  \ the same as me dreamed of Korea and the wonders it would hold. Even in my head\
  \ that sounded corny but it was true. We decided together we would go to Korea to\
  \ start over. Even though it was a trip we had no plans for, it turned into a life\
  \ changing experience.\n\nAfter a week or so of getting over our jet lag, in an\
  \ area where no English speakers were present, we decided to head elsewhere, Hongdae,\
  \ South Korea. The first few days were for exploring and eating at some local restaurants.\
  \ Then, we decided to be adventurous and follow the crowd, literally. Our guesthouse\
  \ was located at a somewhat quiet area with many cafes around, but further down\
  \ the strip we went, we discovered the music.\n\nPeople everywhere, pushing past\
  \ and bumping into you without a look, something you get used to. Food beyond food,\
  \ shopping on every corner, people singing and dancing in the street, and to my\
  \ comfort, English speakers. People were out until 6am every day and just a few\
  \ hours later, starting their day right back up. My first city experience was the\
  \ best first experience. It was everything I ever wanted. These next 2 weeks I would\
  \ make the best of.\n\nI was lucky enough to meet someone during this time that\
  \ would teach me all I needed to know about Korea and what I didn't already learn\
  \ myself. From simple things such as proper etiquette when dining, how to catch\
  \ a taxi, to what your Korean age is. I also learned Koreans are also very concerned\
  \ for your health, as well as being family-oriented. But with all of this known\
  \ to me, I was still always trying my best not to offend anyone with what I was\
  \ yet to learn. Knowing the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of a country is very important\
  \ to me and I want to make sure no matter where I am in the world, I am respectful\
  \ while learning and understanding their culture.\n\nSouth Korea is only the beginning\
  \ of my travels and I can definitely see myself moving there permanently. There\
  \ is so much more to learn and discover in this world and I\u2019m going to take\
  \ that opportunity every chance I get. This was only 2 weeks out of a 4-month journey,\
  \ but the most memorable and I\u2019m grateful for every second of it."
