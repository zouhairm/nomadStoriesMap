Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find such a feeling when I made my very first trip\
  \ to Europe during Christmas Eve in 2017, a feeling known by many travel lovers\
  \ as wanderlust. I know. You might think it\u2019s not a big deal, it\u2019s just\
  \ a wish for traveling more and more, but it\u2019s bigger than this. Somehow, it\u2019\
  s hard to explain with words. I promise I\u2019ll give my best.\n\nI always enjoyed\
  \ traveling, as much as anyone, I guess. However, this feeling changed completely\
  \ when I made this trip to Europe. That wasn\u2019t my first international trip,\
  \ because I had a golden opportunity to live in the USA during the year of 2013.\
  \ I stayed there for eight good months, practicing my English and being familiar\
  \ with another culture. Before this, I have visited Paraguay and Uruguay on small\
  \ trips with my family when I was a child.\n\nMaking a trip on my own\n\nSo, why\
  \ Europe was so special to me? What has changed after all? Europe was the first\
  \ place I choose to be on my own. I planned the entire script, the places I\u2019\
  d like to visit, and the countries I\u2019d like to meet. I bought the flight tickets,\
  \ book the hotels and the train tickets as well and research all I could to make\
  \ the most of it. And I did this all by myself. Thirteen days traveling on my very\
  \ own and six countries: Germany, Holland, Belgium, France, Italy, and Swiss.\n\n\
  That was the first time I feel like moving forward, moving freely, you know? I think\
  \ the best word to describe this feeling is freedom. I saw a brand new word right\
  \ in front of my eyes. A world that I had no idea that was even possible to be real.\
  \ A world that I saw so many times only by pictures. I finally could see it with\
  \ my own eyes. And it was much better than anything else I could imagine.\n\nFrom\
  \ that day on I had this feeling growing bigger and bigger inside of me. A strong\
  \ feeling to discover each piece of this big and beautiful world where we live in.\
  \ Addicted to this, a feeling to turn each trip in memories to share with everyone.\n\
  \nMy little piece of the world\n\nWith this in mind, I\u2019ve created my own blog.\
  \ It\u2019s still a small personal project. I know I have lots of things to do,\
  \ but for now, it\u2019s my little piece of the world, where I can make memories\
  \ and share my experiences with other travel lovers. \n\nI can, not only write about\
  \ my trips, but also show the photos that were once stored on my computer, just\
  \ for me. Now everyone can see what I see through my camera. That\u2019s something\
  \ I really enjoy doing as much as traveling and writing.\n\nEach day I can\u2019\
  t think of anything else than planning my next trip or planning how I\u2019ll tell\
  \ my stories the best way I can to help other travelers. There are so many places\
  \ to see, so many things to share. \n\nWorld, it\u2019s just the beginning\n\nEurope\
  \ was just the beginning. After this trip, I made lots of small trips in 2018 here\
  \ in Brazil, where I live. There are beautiful places to visit here too, many of\
  \ them I still don\u2019t know. And this feeling of wanderlust took me to many more\
  \ places than I could imagine, not only during vacation but also enjoying my free\
  \ weekends to be on the road and the holidays. I spent time traveling this year\
  \ more than any other year.\n\nMeanwhile, I also added a dream trip to San Francisco,\
  \ about four months ago. It was a short trip, but I did it and it made me so happy.\
  \ Europe was just the beginning, the whole world waits for me. I still have many\
  \ countries to visit there, including Portugal, and also another dream trip to Japan.\
  \ Who knows, right? One of them may be much closer than I think. I hope so!"
