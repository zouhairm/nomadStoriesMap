Text: "An affair that takes place at least once every year, at the most suitable venue,\
  \ at the most accurate time and with the finest humans. I am at my most peaceful\
  \ stage during this time of the year, ignoring the rest of the world completely\
  \ out of this arena. This year too likewise the rest, we packed our bags and kept\
  \ only the necessary items.\nHaving decided upon visiting the wild life sanctuary\
  \ for a change we headed to the 40kms away destination. Reaching the site that was\
  \ amidst the jungle, we explored the cottages and the land. It was an avenue where\
  \ in the sun kissed, the river sang and the trees danced with their utmost positivity.\n\
  The aura of the scenic beauty that was felt was similar to the beauty within us.\
  \  Quietly when we were slithering amongst the dense forest looking forward to encounter\
  \ the owners of the jungle, did we realize the best part of togetherness; passing\
  \ those \u201Cssshhss\u201D and \u201Chupps\u201D with a variety of strange faces\
  \ was the most appealing part of the trail. Observing the sun set together from\
  \ between the two pointedly joined twigs made us wonder about the life and death\
  \ theories, we were glad that we would die together if the death approached us then.\n\
  Heading back to the cottage it was dark and there was no facility of artificial\
  \ light or wind. We took seats in the darkest corner, under the starry sky, nearest\
  \ to the huge trees. We discussed about undiscovered entities and conferred all\
  \ the \u2018what Ifs\u2019 and \u2018Buts\u2019 in the conversation, leaving the\
  \ same with an awe of wonder.\nDeep thrilled stories of the forests were shared,\
  \ so as to make one feel the presence of hundreds of others around. We cuddled and\
  \ switched places, spreading a vibe of optimism until the talks ended.\nSitting\
  \ together in absolute silence, staring at different directions, clutching hands\
  \ so tight that neither the pain was felt nor a scream of fright was uttered, sharing\
  \ just a moment which sensed the inseparableness. In the midst of gentle breeze\
  \ and sweet voices of the moving leaves, we had attained the most blissful numbness.\n\
  \nThe most awaited moment which was yet to be gone through had approached, breaking\
  \ the peaceful silence with a crisp packet of batteries, we connected the speakers\
  \ and played the most loved music of old times; we danced uninterruptedly  until\
  \ dawn, on whatever was being played, we were captivated  by the love that had surrounded\
  \ us and the strength that had held us. Our figures were moving involuntarily but\
  \ on perfect beats. We felt free and high above all. It was as if the rightest place\
  \ and the rightest individuals have surrounded me, people whom I have known since\
  \ the beginning of time and wanted to be just there until it stops. Seeing the happiest\
  \ faces of each one of my people made my cheeks turn red with ecstasy.  And that\u2019\
  s how my one night stand with my family of sixteen dear ones ended."
