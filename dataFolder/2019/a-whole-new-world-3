Text: "All I wanted back then was to spend my summer holidays in Mikonos or Ibiza.\n\
  \nInstead, my parents had something else planned: to bring humanitarian aid to embargo-suffering\
  \ Iraq. Since mid-July of that year, people were already dropping dead on the streets\
  \ after the outer temperature had sored up to 70C\xB0 degrees. To sum up, the ideal\
  \ place where to spend August in a camper without A/C and a fridge with a sinister\
  \ tendency to shut down already in the parking lot near the house. I cursed my parents\
  \ the day that at noon we blew a tire on the road from Baghdad to Mosul and we had\
  \ to change it while the sodas in the storage under the camper\u2019s floor were\
  \ exploding like grenades, one after the other.\n\nDespite the Tigris\u2013Euphrates\
  \ river system, Iraq is a huge sandbox. A sandbox with oil. Before invading Kuwait\
  \ in 1990, Iraq was one of the emergent economies of the region. In 1998 the traces\
  \ of what the country could have become if it hadn\u2019t lost the war, and most\
  \ of all, if it hadn\u2019t been sanctioned with the international embargo were\
  \ still there to see. But the embargo had made irreversible damage to the population.\
  \ A child could die because of a simple cold. No medicines, no basic supplies. No\
  \ aspirins, no antibiotics, no syringes or gauzes. Nothing. \n\nWe ate whatever\
  \ was available. Charred chicken in Nassiriya served in old newspapers and the traditional\
  \ \u201Cmasgouf\u201D carp in Mosul, marinated in spices and cooked on an open fire.\
  \ We wore the conservative black \u201Cchador\u201D in the holy cities of Kerbala\
  \ and Najaf and t-shirts for our visit to Babylon. We navigated the Shatt al-Arab\
  \ where the Tigris and the Euphrates merge together and played the piano with the\
  \ only waiter of a deserted hotel in Basra. We distributed tons of medical supplies\
  \ to the hospitals and assorted stationery to the local schools. From north to south,\
  \ every day our cargo was getting lighter, but our hearts heavier. We visited the\
  \ monumental ruins of Ctesiphon near Baghdad and after that, the Amiriyah shelter\
  \ in which hundreds of civilians were incinerated during the Gulf War. \n\nBagdad\
  \ itself was no scenario for the Arabian Nights anymore. In the deserted bazaar,\
  \ newly verdigrised copper lamps were lined out on the ground to be sold to the\
  \ occasional tourist in search of Aladdin. On our last night in Baghdad, we were\
  \ invited to have dinner with the Chaldean patriarch at the Saddam International\
  \ Tower. The tower had a revolving restaurant on the top floor that was opened to\
  \ a selected public only on special occasions. They served us western food, \u201C\
  filet de b\u0153uf au poivre vert\u201D, a world away from the chicken in Nassiriya\
  \ but not for this any better. The embargo was hitting the people, not the government\
  \ or the highest spheres of the Iraqi society. \n\nI was filled with rage. But then,\
  \ the restaurant floor started moving, and I was flying over Baghdad and just for\
  \ a few moments, all the anger and disappointment were washed away.\n\nOn my very\
  \ last night, I had found the magic carpet."
