Text: 'i came from Indonesia which most of the people there don''t really travel to
  find themselves, mostly they are only the "Tourist" type who goes with a group tour,
  follow their Tour Leader and Tour Guides , take photos in famous touristic spots
  mostly around Asia and Europe and that''s it, they don''t really explore, they don''t
  really connect with local people or experience local culture.. i want to change
  that.. so on June 2013 i took a leap of faith and travel solo for the first time
  to Brazil... i applied to be a volunteer for an event called World Youth Day without
  at that time knowing any spanish nor portuguese..

  turns out it was one of the best decisions i''v made in life.. a life changing adventure...
  i realized that what i know in this world is really small after all as i''v met
  and share stories with people from around the world (mostly south americans at that
  time) some from africa and some from europe. there are countless of other cultures
  to explore , to learn,. like there''s always somethin new to see! from then i decided
  to learn spanish and travel anywhere as i can!

  i also got a scholarship last year to study spanish in Colombia for 4months. it
  was an amazing experience for me!'
