Text: "Berlin is one of those cities that is not just a city it's an experience; exploring\
  \ its secrets was exhausting. \n\nIts role as catalyst and its dualities fascinate\
  \ me:  a liberal and intellectual haven vs. the centre of nazi imperialism, hardline\
  \ communism vs. rampant capitalism.  Symbols of the folly of man abound: of politics,\
  \ of war (hot and cold), of resistance, triumph and defeat.  I found it inspiring.\n\
  \nThe last time I was in Germany was 1984. The cold war was heating up, U.S. President\
  \ Ronald Reagan joked over a hot (radio) mic ,\u201Cwe start bombing in 5 minutes\u201D\
  .   Europe went on red alert and I watched things unfold from the centre of it all\
  \ - a \u2018peace camp\u2019 down the road from an American missile base where short\
  \ range nuclear missiles (Pershings) were deployed.\n\nIn those days the iron curtain\
  \ was still up and the only way into Berlin overland was by train through East Germany.\
  \  I never did it, much to my regret,  but I finally had my date with Berlin and\
  \ it was extraordinary.\n\nToday, the most popular part of the city is the Mitte\
  \ district, the former East, the centre if which is Alexanderplatz and the radio\
  \ tower that at one time was the tallest structure in Europe.  \n\nI was introduced\
  \ to Mitte when the airport bus stopped short of its run and sent me onto the streets\
  \ without a map.  I prefer to discover what a city has to offer rather than guidebook\
  \ my way through it, so when i got off the bus I knew two things - which way to\
  \ go and the hostel wasn\u2019t far.  (Tip: Far is relative).   After 1km of navigating\
  \ my small suitcase along the semi- cobblestoned streets I stopped to rest in a\
  \ park. \n\nLooking up I beheld a larger than life brass statue of Friedrich Engels\
  \ standing beside his muse, a seated Karl Marx.  I was definitely in old East Berlin.\
  \  They were surrounded by a series of roughly hewn stone reliefs and brass cast\
  \ depictions of humanities war agonies, western aggression, and photos of U.S. anti-imperialist\
  \ protests.  \n\nWalking through the park I found the original city centre, dateline\
  \ 1700\u2019s.  It was charming (I very rarely use that word),  with winding streets\
  \ and a centuries old church, stone buildings, an outdoor cafe serving hot chocolate\
  \ and showing old black and white movies, and a 300 year old re-built pub.  I got\
  \ a flavour of both pre-war and East Berlin, and through the photos and art, got\
  \ a glimpse of its bawdy nature back then.\n\nThe next day I joined a walking tour.\
  \ Most cities have them and they are hands down the best way to learn a city\u2019\
  s secrets and stories.  We met at Brandenburg Gate(Tor), the 18th Century romanesque\
  \ monumental entrance to Berlin.  A symbol of a divided Germany, it was in \u2018\
  no man\u2019s land\u2019 from 1961, when the wall went up, to 1989 when it fell.\
  \  \n\nWe walked to the Holocaust memorial, half a hectare of granite coffin-like\
  \ stone slabs, that strangely absorb sound, rising from the undulating ground. \
  \ The memorial to the Roma is in Tiergarten Park, between Brandenburg Gate and the\
  \ Reichstag. Both memorials are deeply moving.\nPassing Hitler\u2019s bunker, now\
  \ under a car park, we headed for the former headquarters of the Luftwaffe, now\
  \ the tax office. It survived the war standing because allied bomber pilots used\
  \ the huge building (4000 windows, 2,800 rooms and 7km of corridors) as a landmark.\
  \ \n\nNext door stood Gestapo headquarters and the SS building and though they were\
  \ flattened you can see remnant (underground) cells of the former with a length\
  \ of wall crossing overtop; a stunning display of two conflicted eras.   Where the\
  \ SS building stood is now a museum called \u2018Topography of Terror\u2019, the\
  \ name says it all.  My head was spinning with the meaning and symbology of it all.\n\
  \nI loved Berlin. Uncovering its treasures is invigorating, its trove of museums\
  \ and galleries, excellent public transportation, reasonable prices and great restaurants.\
  \ The nightlife rocks and I even got my film festival fix when I stumbled onto the\
  \ Berlin Short Film festival happening down the road from my hostel.   Auf wiedersehen\
  \ Berlin, till we meet again."
