Text: "Making a local connection\u2026\n\n\u2026With angry neighbours and the Chinese\
  \ police.\n\n\nI had the wonderful privilege of spending my summer in China last\
  \ year, with the goal of improving my \u2013 admittedly still very limited \u2013\
  \ mandarin.  \n\nShanghai is a mammoth of a city with so much to see and experience\
  \ \u2013 incredible and exotic food; countless tourist locations like the Huangpu\
  \ river, Nanjing road and the Pearl tower; and cheap and affordable marketplaces\
  \ where you can buy everything under the sun. \n\nBut like all places, it has its\
  \ downsides. The summer months are monsoon season, and with the amazing locations\
  \ \u2013 where one has to battle enormous crowds \u2013 I was stricken with deluges\
  \ of rain, plagues of mosquitoes and the scorching sun when the clouds finally did\
  \ clear.\n\nSo instead of being cooped up inside, plastered to the air conditioner,\
  \ the friend I was staying with invited me along with her on a trip to Qingdao.\n\
  \nQingdao \u2013 famous for producing Tsingtao beer \u2013 is located in the north\
  \ of China near the sea, so the weather was a wonderful relief from the sweltering\
  \ urban savannah that was Shanghai. People could be seen parasailing just off of\
  \ the rocky shores, the unique smell of the ocean permeated the air, and sunlight\
  \ glinted off the waves \u2013 Qingdao is a proper holiday destination. \n\nWe did\
  \ unashamed tourist things \u2013 we went to the beer factory where they provide\
  \ complimentary beer along with your admission, and ate the local delicacy \u2013\
  \ seafood cooked live for extra freshness. Most people would agree that seafood\
  \ is best fresh, but when it\u2019s literally crawling off your plate, well\u2026\
  \  \n\nApart from my runaway squid, our first day was wonderful; the atmosphere\
  \ of Qingdao was peaceful and friendly, the cobbled streets quaint, with that specific\
  \ \u2018China\u2019 vibe that I absolutely adore. \n\nIt was the next morning that\
  \ we got a knock on our apartment door, and opened it to a man and woman, both of\
  \ whom were rather irate.\n\nUnbeknownst to us, the owner of the flat we were in\
  \ for a couple days wasn\u2019t supposed to be rent it out, and we had been a rather\
  \ large and conspicuous group when moving in the day before. \n\nIf you\u2019ve\
  \ ever heard angry people yelling in Chinese, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree with\
  \ me that they can sound pretty scary \u2013 especially if you have no clue what\
  \ they\u2019re saying. Thus, my strategy for dealing with this was devised; I grabbed\
  \ my passport, cowered in the back room, and prepared to brandish it in their faces\
  \ yelling that I was a British citizen, and I was going to call the consulate!\n\
  \nMy prepared dramatics were thankfully unnecessary as our erstwhile neighbours\
  \ seemed content with angry posturing and expressing their displeasure non-violently.\
  \ My other Chinese-speaking companions had much more imminently practical \u2013\
  \ if not particularly helpful \u2013 solutions and yelled right back. We said we\
  \ had paid for our stay in the flat, while they insisted it was against policy,\
  \ things escalated, and the police were called.\n\nIn complete contrast to our irate\
  \ neighbours, the officers were all patient and understanding, and verified the\
  \ situation properly. The flat owner was called, the building security was consulted,\
  \ the neighbours ranted some more; it was a Thing. \n\nThe whole ordeal took three\
  \ hours, and when we had all packed up and exited the lift, our soon-to-be ex-neighbours\
  \ had rounded up a group of other occupants in the large tower of flats, and they\
  \ had gathered outside to watch us leave (did they not have better things to do\
  \ with their time in the middle of the day?)\n\nWe all walked out like some strange\
  \ procession; us, the stars of the parade escorted by our bodyguards \u2013 the\
  \ long-suffering police officers \u2013 and our not-so-adoring fans. \n\nEven though\
  \ they were probably fed-up with our nonsense, the officers were incredibly helpful,\
  \ and even recommended us a hotel which allowed foreigners to stay in, kindly escorted\
  \ us into taxis and sent us on our way. \n\nIt just goes to show that you never\
  \ know what you\u2019ll experience \u2013 in hindsight I\u2019ll say it was pretty\
  \ exciting, and definitely one of my more memorable trips!"
