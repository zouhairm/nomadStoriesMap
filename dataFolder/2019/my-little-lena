Text: "It was summertime - not mine, but theirs - cool, yet hot with the bustling\
  \ of bikini- and speedo-clad Russians desperate to steal any available sunshine\
  \ by the lake. \n\nLena ran down the wildflowered path near the water - the \u201C\
  squish-squash\u201D of her feet hitting the marshy ground grew louder as she approached\
  \ me. My new friend jumped into my arms and kissed my cheek. Her 5-year-old innocence\
  \ knew nothing of the decades of animosity standing between us.\nThis was the first\
  \ of many summers I would spend as a teenager volunteering in Roscheno, Russia -\
  \ a village near St. Petersburg. An American from the South, I was still too cold\
  \ to wear anything less than a t-shirt and jeans. \n\nLena held my hand as we picked\
  \ flowers for the fourth time that week. By now, she had invited me over for lunch\
  \ with her mother. I was to meet her in front of her building that afternoon and\
  \ she would show me to the room they shared with another woman and her young daughter.\
  \ \nTheir room was dark with only a few pieces of furniture. Lena\u2019s mother\
  \ sat me down on one of the beds, which was used in place of dining chairs. A table\
  \ was pulled in front of me. The others sat, nestling me between them. \nI was offered\
  \ hot black tea and two thick shortbread cookies with even thicker slabs of butter\
  \ between them. My gracious hosts were thrilled as I ate their \u201Cbutter sandwiches\u201D\
  \ and navigated through the conversation.\n\n\u201CIdi syuda,\u201D Lena said in\
  \ her soft voice, interrupting my attempts to communicate with the adults. I understood\
  \ some Russian by then. \u201CCome here,\u201D she repeated, motioning me toward\
  \ the splintery cupboard at the end of her bed. Her face was glowing with pride\
  \ as she reached inside. A breeze whipped through the slightly cracked window, punctuating\
  \ the moment.\nShe then placed a clay figurine of a woman wearing a red dress and\
  \ matching hat in my hands. The paint flaking and the red staining my fingers, my\
  \ heart filled with gratitude. She had given me what seemed to be her only toy.\
  \ \n\nThe gift of her tiny treasure was a glimpse into the heart of the Russian\
  \ culture and a lasting lesson about giving my best and not withholding. I did not\
  \ expect to find one of my greatest teachers in a child."
