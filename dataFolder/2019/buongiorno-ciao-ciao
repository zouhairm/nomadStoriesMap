Text: "Trattoria Mario\u2019s at 12:34 on a hot Florentine Wednesday. The place to\
  \ be. A small restaurant located on the outskirts of the San Lorenzo marketplace.\
  \ Only open between the hours of twelve and four because that\u2019s all they need.\
  \ Communal dining and daily changes to the menu to reflect what is fresh. It was\
  \ the first restaurant in Florence where we had to wait for a table. Three of us\
  \ were seated at a table set for four. Moments later, the empty seat was offered\
  \ to an old Italian man with gray facial hair and a bright orange polo. He nodded\
  \ to each of us saying \u201CBuongiorno, Ciao, Ciao\u201D. We smiled and muttered\
  \ what tried to sound like an Italian greeting back to him. The restaurant was alive;\
  \ overcrowded with guests, the staff hustled, diners yelled in all different languages,\
  \ people from all over the world gathered to indulge. We were lost in, but our new\
  \ Italian friend was clearly home. He ordered and finished his food before we even\
  \ received our water. I asked for a rating of his dish with a thumbs up or down;\
  \ he gave a big smile, thumbs up and a nod. Then he got up, said \u201CCiao\u201D\
  \ and walked away. He was supremely calm and happy to be there amidst the huge crowd,\
  \ despite his solo title. Our new Italian friend is the perfect parallel to the\
  \ city of Florence; overcrowded, loud and full of people from all over the world,\
  \ but with a comfortable sense of independence. A calm knowing that you can be alone\
  \ without ever feeling empty. Alone, but belonging\u2026the unique magic of Florence,\
  \ just like the small Italian man in Trattoria Mario\u2019s."
