Text: "The story kind of starts with my boyfriend biting the head off a deep-fried\
  \ fish.\nBut let's backtrack just a little more.  I had a four-day weekend and had\
  \ decided to use it to make my way from my home in Tokyo to Yakushima, a land best\
  \ known for having the oldest trees in Japan and being the setting for the studio\
  \ Ghibli film Princess Mononoke.  After our second full day of hiking, and feeling\
  \ like we had really accomplished everything we were going to have time to do in\
  \ Yakushima, we headed to an izakaya, or a Japanese style restaurant/bar, a few\
  \ minutes from our hotel.  \nIt was an excellent find.  The izakaya was small -\
  \  it had a decent-sized bar space and only three short tables on tatami-style mats.\
  \  We were the only non-locals in the restaurant.  Although it started normally,\
  \ everything was so good that the meal quickly developed into a feast.  The edamame\
  \ had the perfect amount of salt.  The tamagoyaki was a perfect blend of sweet and\
  \ hearty.  Then, the fish: It was whole and deep-fried, erected upright, fins out,\
  \ with the skewer piercing it so that it seemed to still be swimming.  The meat\
  \ was so juicy and tender, the outside so light and crispy, you could just cry.\
  \ It was a masterpiece.\nAs the place started to clear out, a couple from the next\
  \ table hollered to us, \"You have to eat the fins!\"  So we tried them.  They were\
  \ right.  They were a delicious, ridged-potato-chip-like snack to accompany the\
  \ fish.  \"Now the head!\" they hollered.  I honestly didn't even know how to eat\
  \ the head - there was no meat to pick off! - so I asked my boyfriend.  He picked\
  \ up the whole fish with his chopsticks, smiled at me and said \"Like this!\" and\
  \ bit the whole head, bone and all, clean off.  They cheered.  \"Kakko ii\" (\"\
  How cool!\") shouted the woman.  We had made friends.\nThe next thing we knew, we\
  \ had gotten into a cab with them, gone back to their friends' house for a party,\
  \ and were chatting about how much we loved Yakushima.  They were telling us about\
  \ watching the sea turtles hatch and return to the sea, when the man started showing\
  \ us pictures of a former crystal mine he had found by chance.  He showed us pictures\
  \ of this beach of huge, light-colored rocks with white, and sometimes dark red,\
  \ lines running through them from top to bottom, for meters.  He insisted that the\
  \ lines were all crystal, and that this was a former crystal mine, and in some of\
  \ the pictures, it really looked that way.  When he realized we were leaving the\
  \ next day, and that the next day was a national holiday so he was off work, he\
  \ insisted to taking us there.  I tried to explain that if we didn't catch our 10AM\
  \ ferry, we would definitely miss our flight, so as lovely as it sounded, it was\
  \ probably not possible.  They took it as a challenge and he agreed to pick us up\
  \ at our hotel at 7:00 so we could definitely make our ferry.  \nSure enough, he\
  \ arrived at 7:00 the next day, drove us about halfway around the island and took\
  \ us past a \"Enter at Your Own Risk\" sign.  It was definitely not intended for\
  \ people to climb on.  I felt relatively certain that I would slip, fall, and need\
  \ to be helicoptered out.  But from the moment we arrived, it was clear that those\
  \ lines throughout the rock really were crystal, and they were simply dazzling in\
  \ the sunlight.  Our friend dug some larger-sized crystals out with his fingers\
  \ and gave them to me.  We stayed about an hour, climbing up and down over the sandstone,\
  \ exploring the largest hole of pure crystal - already hollowed out by miners -\
  \ watching the waterfalls and the waves crashing against the rocks around us and\
  \ beyond.  We drove back, caught our ferry, and returned home.\nI still have those\
  \ crystals; one white, one red, one both.  I plan to keep them forever.  There are\
  \ so many wonderful things to do in Yakushima, but I would never have imagined we'd\
  \ find this."
