Text: "We rattled past misty mountains, bunches of yellow flowers crashing against\
  \ the empty windows. Pollen perforated through the carriage, a beaten-up old tin\
  \ can of olive green, giving way momentarily to the putrid stench of a toilet left\
  \ uncleaned for several decades. \n\nA 100-metre skeleton trembling between two\
  \ sheer cliff faces came into view. We lurched haphazardly onto Goteik viaduct and\
  \ suddenly verdant greenery plunged into stark stone below us. I froze, suspended\
  \ in sheer panic, before the Burmese man next to me stood up, stretched and calmly\
  \ lit a cigarette, signalling our arrival onto safe ground. \n\nThe blood was just\
  \ returning to my gnawed fingertips when I caught the gaze of two stern men. I could\
  \ just make out the Shan state flag stitched onto their military uniforms before\
  \ we chugged past into thick maze of palm trees. It was just long enough to take\
  \ note of the matt-black AK47\u2019s they were clutching. The bridge wasn\u2019\
  t looking so bad anymore.  \n\nI was about to head into the longest-running civil\
  \ conflict in the world. Here in Myanmar\u2019s northeastern Shan State, home of\
  \ dreamlike landscapes of cascading wildflowers, fear of your neighbour is psychologically\
  \ engrained. Rolling hills of golden crop conceal ever-changing enemies, status\
  \ quo can alter with every passing hour, and any chance of governmental relief is\
  \ systematically corrupted through bitter tribal power struggles. \n\nI took an\
  \ overnight hike from Hsipaw. My guide, Napar, was a slight, goofy 22-year-old from\
  \ a small village in northern Shan state. We trekked through tumbling hillsides\
  \ with wild grass up to our waists and shared stories of our families and hometowns.\
  \ Napar told me stories about his dad, a doctor and therefore highly respected community\
  \ leader. One day, soldiers came to his village looking for him. They forced him\
  \ to walk in front of them as they crossed the jungle, to test for landmines set\
  \ the previous year. Napar\u2019s father found one but identified it in time - it\
  \ exploded five metres behind him. \n\nThough not ethnically Shan, the Palaung,\
  \ Napar's ethnic group are closely associated with the Northern Alliance (NA-B);\
  \ a military coalition who oppose the Southern Shan State Alliance (SSA-S). Also\
  \ known simply as the Shan State Army, the SSA-S are one of the most formidable\
  \ rebel groups in Myanmar and have long-standing affiliations with Burman rulers\
  \ and military.  \n\nWe crossed thick jungle. Napar showed me how to blow bubbles\
  \ with a local reed and shoot grass arrows. He was kind and adventurous, and his\
  \ eyes would light up when he talked about his girlfriend. I was very fond of him.\
  \ At one point, we reached an old man sat on his haunches, smoking nonchalantly.\
  \ He called to Napar, and suddenly three young men appeared. They were adorned with\
  \ SSA-S regalia and clutching assault rifles. \n\nI nervously smiled as Napar the\
  \ man exchanged gruff monosyllables. The other men stood by, watching closely. Finally,\
  \ he dismissed us.  \n\n\u201CWhat the hell was that?\u201D I whispered.\n\n\u201C\
  Shan army - wanted to know what I was doing here.\u201D\n\nThey had recognised his\
  \ Palaung features immediately; we were but an hour\u2019s trek from his village.\
  \ I asked if this was normal, or whether my being there had ruffled them. He responded\
  \ calmly that had I not been, he would have been \u201Cin big trouble\u201D. He\
  \ laughed nervously and we went back to blowing bubbles. \n\nA technicolour sunset\
  \ cascaded across the horizon as we stopped at the village we were to spend the\
  \ night. Children with faces caked in Thanaka tumbled excitedly towards us, and\
  \ mothers washing clothes in the fading light waved warmly. Foreigners were rare\
  \ in these parts, Napar explained. \n\nAs night fell, the world fell silent and\
  \ the only light came from the impossibly clarion starscape above. The military\
  \ had cut the village's electricity a few months back to ensure no spying could\
  \ take place. But, as it had only come four years before, no one missed it much.\
  \ The only life, bar the huffs of a few domestic animals was coming from inside\
  \ the village\u2019s tiny monastery. Monks were finishing their nightly prayers,\
  \ and in the midst of smoking plumes of incense, I could just make out some tattered\
  \ Arsenal posters, next to landmine survival guides."
