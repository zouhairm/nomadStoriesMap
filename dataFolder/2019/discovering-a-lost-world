Text: "One day many years ago, in the days before Instagram (yes, that many years\
  \ ago), I was perusing a blog called 'Places to See Before You Die'.  I came across\
  \ an image - not a story, just an image - of a flat-topped mountain hugged by palm\
  \ trees, with waterfalls cascading down the sides.  I couldn't see any evidence\
  \ of a single human footprint.  The mountain towered above the surrounding plains\
  \ - steep rock walls that appeared impossible and mysterious. 'I have to go there',\
  \ I said to myself, with no idea of what that would entail.  I saved the image of\
  \ Mount Roraima on my computer, and after a little research which led me to discover\
  \ that the mountain was an ancient tepui plateau, the home of wild creatures endemic\
  \ to the mountain like pitcher plants, and of frogs that haven't evolved since the\
  \ time of dinosaurs, the decision was made.  \n\nMy travel companion was an unlikely\
  \ one.  Well, not unlikely in the sense that he was my boyfriend at the time, but\
  \ basically in all other respects.  Tim, a computer scientist, had not travelled\
  \ outside of the civilisations of Europe before.  He preferred being indoors to\
  \ being outdoors, and felt very uncomfortable at the prospect of slow internet,\
  \ let alone NO internet.  It was a true sign of his commitment that he was willing\
  \ to be plunged into the depths of the Venezuelan jungle by small plane, and to\
  \ break in his camping gear on our technology-free journey to the summit.\n\nIt\
  \ took about four days to hike up to the base camp of Roraima, after a few nights\
  \ acclimatizing to the area in the Canaima rainforest, where we slept in hammocks\
  \ and discovered poisonous dart frogs in slippery caves.  There were no roads approaching\
  \ the mountain in any direction, so our only option was to arrive on foot.  It was\
  \ a steep half day of climbing to the top, but when we got there we were greeted\
  \ by the most incredible views I have ever seen in my many years of hiking since.\
  \  Roraima is not the only flat-top tepui in the area, so from its height we could\
  \ look out to others, and squint to see where we had begun our journey.  You must\
  \ only climb the mountain with a guide, so we chose a local Venezuelan who could\
  \ share with us the stories and legends of the magical mountains that surrounded\
  \ us.  We were grateful for our guide when we ventured out onto the summit, and\
  \ realised that everything looked the same - other-worldly and unforgiving.  We\
  \ discovered secret swimming holes, crystals, carnivorous plants, and even a lake\
  \ as we hiked the 21km to the triple border where Venezuela touches Brazil and Guyana.\
  \  \n\nSometimes, back home in Melbourne, I daydream about those faraway lands.\
  \  I wonder what is happening up on that mountain - if it is shrouded in cloud today,\
  \ or if there is anyone up there looking for secrets.  It reminds me that there\
  \ is still mystery in the world, and adventures yet to be had.  Venezuela is going\
  \ through a political turmoil that was just beginning when we were there - we had\
  \ no toilet paper on our trip because the country had run out.  I can't imagine\
  \ what it's like for the people agonising over whether to flee their beautiful homeland;\
  \ my heart breaks a little just thinking about it.  But I do know that the dinosaur\
  \ frogs are still up there on Roraima, unaware of what is going on around them.\
  \  And I hope they are for a million years to come."
