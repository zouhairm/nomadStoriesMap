Text: "Don\u2019t talk to strangers on the internet. That\u2019s what they always\
  \ told me, growing up. Yet I was always the curious type, and could you blame me?\
  \ I had the entire world at my fingertips and some restless feet. I never really\
  \ fit in where I grew up. \n\nI looked for an escape, but to think that a single\
  \ tweet could spark some magic? Never did I imagine that it could come this far\
  \ \u2014 a completely different person from the absolute other side of the world\
  \ became my best friend. \n\nI had always imagined the moment we would meet, and\
  \ when our first trip was planned I was beyond excited. Of course, life never goes\
  \ according to plan. She told me that she wouldn\u2019t be able to meet me for another\
  \ day, yet when myself and another friend arrived at The London Eye, someone ran\
  \ up behind me in the crowd of tourists and placed her hands right over my eyes.\
  \ The shock and relief when I heard her voice was unreal. The surprises didn\u2019\
  t stop there. It\u2019s now a ritual to basically surprise me, whether it\u2019\
  s scaring the hell out of me by hiding in the airbnb closet before I arrive, or\
  \ unexpectedly running up to me at the airport! She has always gone out of her way\
  \ to be a great friend and teach me to expect the unexpected.\n\nI promise I\u2019\
  ll get her back one day.\n\nHer name? Serena. She is an Italian girl down under\
  \ in Australia, and I am a Punjabi girl from the opposite pole \u2014 Canada. Our\
  \ friendship does not just span a single country, it defies the boundaries of borders,\
  \ space, and time. It has placed opportunities in my hands that I could not fathom.\
  \ From going to London to see One Direction perform in the flesh, to looking for\
  \ princes in Los Angeles, to swimming in infinity pools in Singapore, to trekking\
  \ through Indonesian jungles, and pulling pranks in the streets of Sydney. \n\n\
  Truthfully, we are just getting started and I can feel that our friendship will\
  \ be one to last a lifetime. I am beyond thankful for every set of circumstances\
  \ that has crossed our paths together. \n\nI did not expect, however, that I would\
  \ find such a beautiful human being and a best friend through my travels. \n\nIt\
  \ is a marvellous thing to experience that the world is simultaneously so small,\
  \ yet so extensive. We must remind ourselves that there are so many places and friendships\
  \ to still discover."
