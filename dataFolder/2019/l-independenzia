Text: "When a young woman first arrives abroad in Italy, she lacks independence. Constantly\
  \ inviting other Americans on her study abroad program to visit new Italian cities\
  \ with her becomes frustrating when no one wants to join her.\nShe has two options:\
  \ to miss out on the opportunity of a lifetime and exile herself in her host family\u2019\
  s home, or embark on the adventure alone.\nAlong the way she meets many entrancing\
  \ new friends and is captivated and intoxicated by experiencing a new culture. She\
  \ learns to navigate the world alone, but more importantly she learns to embrace\
  \ her solitude.\nUnburdened by cliques, cultural insensitivity or restrictive social\
  \ norms American students often carry with them abroad, she is capable of becoming\
  \ a character in Italy\u2019s story, instead of simply making Italy the backdrop\
  \ of her own.\nShe learns of art history and of a culture that prioritizes family\
  \ and friends above capitalism and work. In this culture, she is not asked first\
  \ \u201Cwhat do you do?\u201D But instead \u201Cwho are you? What do you love? What\
  \ drives you? Who do you yearn to be?\u201D\nShe travels to her 14th new city alone\
  \ and enters a bar. She\u2019s been content with her solitude, but she yearns to\
  \ make a connection.\nA man buys her a drink. She accepts, but first she has to\
  \ pee.\nThe night is on fast forward and can not be rewound.\nShe awakes and does\
  \ not remember the night before. She awakes and is surrounded by three strange men\
  \ in a hotel, who are speaking a language secondary to her. She understands, though,\
  \ what has occurred.\nThe solitude and autonomy she just claimed was taken from\
  \ her.\nIt\u2019s nearly 5 years later now and she\u2019s reclaimed her autonomy.\
  \ She founded a nonprofit for survivors of sexual assault and she\u2019s doing her\
  \ life\u2019s work. She doesn\u2019t believe that everything happens for a reason\
  \ but she found a reason to move forward, to affect change and to help others reclaim\
  \ their solitude, autonomy and peace.\n\nNot everything happens for a reason, but\
  \ if you can find a reason to make a positive impact, do."
