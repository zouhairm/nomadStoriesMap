Text: "There is a southern ancient port city, located in a land that is refuted with\
  \ complicated political heaviness that bears down screaming and asserting itself\
  \ in every contemporary conversation. Political weight aside, such an old city,\
  \ rich in diversity, offers anyone who asks, a kindness, and inclusivity of \u201C\
  welcome.\u201D Its exuberant stone paths and intricate and narrow alley ways, reveal\
  \ a simple, uncomplicated, direct historical and ancestral line for many. The fast-pace\
  \ and yet laid-back fervor culture that is Jaffa plays an unforgettable experience\
  \ in my time in Israel in the fall of 2014. The port city Jaffa, is a part of Tel\
  \ Aviv, also known as Yafo in Hebrew or Yaffa in Arabic. All names are interchangeable\
  \ and unify in reference to the ancient city. \n\nI was a fresh college graduate\
  \ of art history, hoping to take root in Israel\u2019s unique art scene. It was\
  \ my first time walking alone in Jaffa, trying earnestly to find my way to my internship\
  \ interview for an up and coming art gallery. I never was physically alone due to\
  \ the busy streets and vendors, but felt a sense of isolation not sharing a mother\
  \ tongue with others. As I walked the winding streets, I felt more alone and lost.\
  \ I purposely did not have a working smartphone with data. I wanted an authentic\
  \ experience learning landmarks and street names on my own without the help of technology.\
  \ However, as time passed, the street numbers became further than my handwritten\
  \ address. Intuitively, I felt time slipping away from me.\n\nAs the hot Mediterranean\
  \ sun continued to pounce and create a gilded glow on Jaffa\u2019s narrow cobble\
  \ streets and shops, I decided to ditch my pride and ask for help. I choked up the\
  \ courage to brokenly ask in Hebrew for directions. I decided on a shop of knickknacks\
  \ and stepped in. Greeted with a warm shalom, I went ahead asking for the shopkeeper\u2019\
  s assistance. We did not share a common language, but she was concerned in helping\
  \ me find the gallery. She decided to come with me and we would walk together to\
  \ find it. After a block, she too became perplexed in finding the address. We then\
  \ both stepped in another shop to ask for their help.\n\nThe other shopkeeper and\
  \ her discussed it, and now he was coming with us. As all three of us made our way\
  \ through the neighborhood, gradually, bystanders on the street took notice. It\
  \ seemed everyone knew each other, everyone was a friend of a friend. As the adhan\
  \ called in the air, the neighborhood bakeries were placing their za\u2019atar breads\
  \ outside for sale. With every sense distracted, I no longer felt alone. Finding\
  \ the gallery felt hopeless and like aimless wondering for forty years. But I felt\
  \ a sense of ease with my new company of locals, despite not all of us being able\
  \ to communicate very well. \n\nAs minutes passed, adamant to help onlookers joined\
  \ in. Before I knew it, I had a diverse cohort escorting me to my elusive destination.\
  \ My new friends were young, old, men, women, some in kippas, hijabs, some speaking\
  \ English, Hebrew, Arabic, and even Russian. Turns out, I had the wrong address\
  \ and eventually someone had an idea of where this new gallery space was located,\
  \ not far from where we were. Shortly after, we found the street and gallery space.\
  \ \n\nSuddenly, I felt reassurance of my destination as I heard my name called above\
  \ me. I looked up, a man peering from a balcony looked down at me. He had been patiently\
  \ waiting. I was finally here and this was what I assumed to be the gallery owner.\
  \ I knew I had made it to my destination. \n\nEveryone let out sighs of relief and\
  \ laughter, all in unison. I said my many thanks and goodbyes. I felt glum and was\
  \ alone again, but relieved to look at my watch seeing I was not too late. I looked\
  \ back up to the gallery owner on the balcony, the sun was behind him. \n\nLooking\
  \ rather curious, he stated, \u201CThat is quite an entrance. Welcome, come on up.\u201D"
