Text: "I felt uncomfortable, a few weeks after finishing my degree. It was difficult\
  \ to not have secured a job while I watched my friends move on with their life.\
  \ I swallowed myself in blankets and was dragged out of it to Thailand, Phuket.\
  \ We lived like locals for a week at a self-catering apartment in Mai khao beach\
  \ with extra sunblock and a rental car. Family holidays would not be entertaining\
  \ without some sort of drama and we had a lot of it. \n\nAs we left our hotel to\
  \ venture out one morning to Patong we were greeted by our receptionist named \u201C\
  Cake\u201D. Her name was pronounced Ka-Keh and she wasn\u2019t dressed in frosting.\
  \ We made it out to the main road, which runs through the island and listened to\
  \ the radio that played Thai versions of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston which\
  \ caught us by surprise. As Mai khao seemed to calmly close Patong seemed to rush\
  \ in and slap you in the face with confetti. We saw what the locals will call \u201C\
  legal U-turns\u201D and traffic circles that had motor bikes, bicycles and cars.\
  \ I watched my dad\u2019s anxiety go up as he skillfully drove between them to ensure\
  \ our deposit was returned at the end of our holiday.   \n\nMy sister played navigator\
  \ with a maps app which luckily used live maps with arrows because everything looked\
  \ like gibberish on my dad\u2019s phone. It was about a 45 minute to an hour drive\
  \ between windy roads and green lush mountains. On arrival my dad parallel parked\
  \ outside a slightly dodge massage parlor where fair skinned women were doing their\
  \ makeup. As we got out of the vehicle we were notified by one of the shop vendors\
  \ who told us that we will get a hefty fine from the police if we park there. My\
  \ dad left us there in the hope of finding parking somewhere nearby. \nOne hour\
  \ passed, he didn\u2019t return. He was the only one with a cell phone with an international\
  \ sim card so there was no way to contact him. Not the best planning. We walked\
  \ around the corner to check if maybe he would drive past but we were unlucky. Although\
  \ we did find little travel agencies, more beach dressed tourists and colorful posters\
  \ for parties at different clubs in Patong. This really didn\u2019t do much to ease\
  \ my mother\u2019s stress and answer the question crossing all our minds, where\
  \ the hell is he? \n\nFinally, he returned finding parking a street away thank god.\
  \ After admitting he got lost and climbed a curb to get back we made our way to\
  \ Bangla road. It had the most amount of massage parlors in a row that I had ever\
  \ seen in my life.  The first one had a sign on the door that said, \u201CNo happy\
  \ endings\u201D. We proceeded with caution as they greeted my dad \u201Csah wah\
  \ dee khaa\u201D with a happy smile and signaled him to come inside. I guess their\
  \ target was 40-year-old and above men.\n\nConsidering it was mid-December the heat\
  \ was getting worse and I have the tanned pictures to show it. It did attract interesting\
  \ smells on our arrival to the market. Though, nothing stopped my sister and I from\
  \ getting excited to see a Thai rolled ice-cream stall which I guess was just normal\
  \ rolled ice-cream for Thai people. We ordered mango and mint and received a whole\
  \ show as he prepared, chopped and dragged the mixture in beat with his metal spatulas.\
  \ The show was just as good as the ice-cream.\n\nWe got back to the hotel later\
  \ that afternoon and sat around the table. My mother made fried chips for my sister\
  \ and jasmine rice with chicken tom-yum for the rest of us. The rice was mushy because\
  \ my mum overcooked it and the fried chips were unexpectedly sweet potatoes which\
  \ my carb loving sister was not happy about. Nevertheless, the table was filled\
  \ with warmth as we spoke and laughed about the events of the day. I realized then\
  \ that bad things put together can still feel good if you\u2019re with the right\
  \ people. I was going to be okay."
