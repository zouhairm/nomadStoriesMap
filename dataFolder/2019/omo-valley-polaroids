Text: "Traveling from New York to Ethiopia just to take some polaroid pictures always\
  \ seemed like a far-fetched idea but here I am, driving through the Omo Valley with\
  \ a local guide named Melak whom I met through Instagram. \n\n\u201CYou should hold\
  \ onto that\u201D\n\n\u201Cwhat?\u201D \n\n\u201CThat! The Handle\u201D\n\nMelak\
  \ points to the handle above my seat as he veers our 4x4 off the road. I\u2019ve\
  \ always referred to this handle as the \u201COh Shit Bar\u201D. You know, for those\
  \ \u201Coh shit\u201D moments when you find yourself grabbing onto that handle for\
  \ dear life. As Melak and I speed through one of the most remote regions of Southern\
  \ Ethiopia, our 4x4 violently vibrates with the kinetics of a mechanical bull. The\
  \ \u201COh shit bar\u201D is the only thing keeping me from bashing my head into\
  \ the windshield. \n\nMelak and I are headed to a remote Daasanach village on the\
  \ outskirts of Omorate, a small market town in Ethiopia\u2019s Lower Omo Valley.\
  \ The Dassanach are an ancient African tribe, who have inhabited the Lower Omo for\
  \ centuries. Unfortunately, within the past few years, the Ethiopian government\
  \ has leased several acres of Dassanach land to foreign investors. These corporations\
  \ have recently established multiple large-scale commercial irrigation schemes In\
  \ Dassanach territory. \n\nI didn\u2019t find out about this situation on the news\
  \ or online. I found out about it through Melak.\nWe met online about 2 years ago.\
  \ He grew up in the Lower Omo and runs his own eco-tourism company. I had been following\
  \ him on Instagram since I\u2019ve always dreamed of traveling to the Omo Valley.\
  \ One day Melak decided to reach out to me. He was fascinated by my use of instant\
  \ photography and invited to Southern Ethiopia to share my passion with many individuals\
  \ that do not have access to photography.\n\nThe Dassanach village we are traveling\
  \ to has been forcibly resettled as a result of the foreign investors' conflict.\
  \ This has caused many members of the community to abandon their traditional livelihoods,\
  \ which has ultimately turned many individuals into wage laborers [many who are\
  \ working for the same corporations that are responsible for their resettlement]\n\
  \n\n\nDuring our drive, Melak explained how forced resettlement has damaged the\
  \ livelihood of the Dassanach community and as a result, they are becoming more\
  \ reliant on wage labor and tourism in order to survive.  \u201CThere is not much\
  \ we can do; they are being forced to modernize but those who stay in the village\
  \ don\u2019t really benefit.\u201D \n\n \u201CIf they stay in the village, the only\
  \ contact they have with the outside world is with corporations that are taking\
  \ their land or tourists who are taking their photos, \u201CSays Melak with a disappointed\
  \ expression.\n\nWe plan to take their photos as well, but these photos will be\
  \ theirs to keep.\n\nAs we enter the Dassanach village we are greeted by a small\
  \ group of children and then a few young men & women. Everyone seemed very happy\
  \ to see Melak. He gathered up a few of the elders and tried to explain our photo\
  \ idea.  They seemed very confused at first and didn\u2019t really understand what\
  \ we meant. \n\nI decided to pull out my camera and gesture the elders to stand\
  \ in the frame. I snapped their photo and out came an instant image. They had definitely\
  \ never seen that before. They were extremely happy when I handed over the photo\
  \ to them but the most fascinating part was watching them see the photo developed.\
  \ They all huddle around the photo smiling and laughing. I viewed that as a \u201C\
  thumbs up\u201D and continued to take dozens of individual and group portraits with\
  \ a focus on inclusion and pride. Each subject was able to keep a portrait of themselves\
  \ or their loved ones. And the end I took a few group portraits of the entire tribe.\
  \ By doing this, we created a very unique connection but more importantly, we were\
  \ able to give back something that is often taken away from them [a photo, a memory,\
  \ a reflection of themselves]\n\nI believe each portrait allows these individuals\
  \ to be a part of modernization and not just a victim of it."
