Text: "As we apprehensively climbed into the small 10 seater plane, we were unaware\
  \ what was ahead of us as we embarked on our adventure to the largely unknown Kokoda\
  \ Track in Papua New Guinea.  Messages we brought with us to the small airport just\
  \ outside of Port Moresby included \u2018it is one of the most difficult and life\
  \ changing things you will ever do\u2019 and \u2018it holds so much national history\u2019\
  .  But the messages we brought back to Australia upon completion were so much more.\n\
  \nGetting off the plane in the small village of Kokoda, we were met by the friendly\
  \ faces that reside there, as well as our local porters, who were to become like\
  \ our brothers over the coming days.  Unsure of what to expect, the trek began.\
  \  It didn\u2019t take long for the tropical downpour to start, as we traversed\
  \ the spectacular scenery of the Owen Stanley Ranges and their steep inclines, sharp\
  \ ridges, deep valleys, and rivers that weaved their way through the villages, providing\
  \ us with much relief from the sweltering heat and humidity.\n\nPhotos may provide\
  \ an understanding of the wild and unforgiving location, dense with impenetrable\
  \ jungle, persistent mountains and their relentless false peaks; rivers that flow\
  \ silently in some areas and forcefully swift in others; the stunning butterflies\
  \ that lightly flap their blue and black wings above the river below; the warm and\
  \ inviting smiles of the locals when you arrive exhausted in their villages; the\
  \ red stained lips of your porters who enjoy a regular chew on betal nut; and the\
  \ remnants of Australian and Japanese jungle warfare from 1942, which now includes\
  \ somber yet alluring memorials dotted along the track where you learn more about\
  \ haunting, harrowing and heroic stories.  Photos will even provide proof of your\
  \ hard work fighting against every steep and slippery step through blistered feet,\
  \ soaking wet clothing and exhausted expressions on your face.  What these photos\
  \ will not show, however, is your growing sense of awe, or the bonds you make with\
  \ your fellow trekkers and the admirably supportive porters, or the evocative and\
  \ soothing sounds of your porters voices echoing through the jungle in song to motivate\
  \ and encourage you, or those feelings that take over your body that you are likely\
  \ to never shake.\n\nKokoda displays a rich and torturous history and is symbolic\
  \ in shaping Australia.  Every year, thousands of people take part in the pilgrimage\
  \ across the Track, yet, less than 0.1% of Australians have completed it.  Those\
  \ that do, find a strength, resilience and belief in themselves that they may never\
  \ knew they had, as well as pride, knowing that they have achieved something very\
  \ few people will ever try.  Hard moments come, not only from the many river crossings,\
  \ arduous climbs and precarious descents, but also from the intimate ceremonies\
  \ in memory of some of the most important battles in the Kokoda campaign. You will\
  \ fight back tears, sometimes unsuccessfully, while reading out loud moving poems\
  \ and stories in memory of brave and selfless soldiers that walked this track before\
  \ you.  Reaching the Isurava Battlefield, where the remote PNG jungle opens up to\
  \ lush green grass, distinctive rocks, and striking views across the valley, you\
  \ will see four stones which read Courage, Endurance, Sacrifice and Mateship.  Emotive\
  \ words when read individually, but strong and symbolic when seen together.  Kokoda\
  \ Track is not just about a historic and heroic military campaign, it is about breaking\
  \ barriers, bringing out the good in people and, possibly and unintentionally, finding\
  \ yourself.\n\nKokoda will change you.  You will find things within yourself that\
  \ you may not have expected to find.  You will be stronger in yourself, more self\
  \ accepting, and with increased patience and humility.  Some days or moments will\
  \ transport you back and you will refer to it many years from now, forever holding\
  \ the experience and its integrity in the highest regard."
