Text: All i ever wanted to do when I was little is to travel.I love discovering new
  places and exploring them.I went on a local trip to Soweto with my sister.The respected
  town of were the greatest World Icon President Nelson Mandela house is,before he
  was arrested for 27 years during the apartheid in our country.I felt very blessed
  to be in the same house-museum with different races to pay respect and to want to
  know about his life.That man fought for equality and there should be no oppression.i
  even made new friends with Ghana girls,we had a good time dancing to south African
  music,embracing the culture of Africa. Afterwards i walked down the street,I saw
  a board.it caught my eyes,for a moment I thought I had eye-sight problem.It was
  written (SOWETO LIVE SNAKE SHOW)I panicked wanted to get out from that place immediately
  but a lady from that place saw me and invited me in.it looked very creepy inside
  as if it was a haunted house,to be honest I thought I did sign for myself a death
  warrant when I saw huge snakes-anacondas,pythons.then I had to face my fear because
  all my life I never imagined myself holding a snake but it was one of the best decision
  I've ever made.It was scary at first but it felt so good to see it moving around
  my waist,i ever named her Leuricey.We felt connectedi, took alot of pictures with
  her.A beautiful experience,unforgettable momories
