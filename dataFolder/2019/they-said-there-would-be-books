Text: "My first impression of Wales felt like cold sunshine and tasted like peach\
  \ cider. My mum sat across the sticky pub table from me, suitcases with maple leaf\
  \ tags propping up our travel-weary feet. We were so tired it felt like we had physically\
  \ crossed the North American continent and Atlantic Ocean by foot, instead of snugly\
  \ enclosed in a Boeing 787, thousands of feet in the sky. It was a lovely day in\
  \ Wales, which meant there was a chilly breeze but the sun was out. As I shifted\
  \ around on an antique wooden bar stool, I felt I had made a mistake with my order.\
  \ This was the land of beer, dragons, myths and legends. And I had ordered peach\
  \ cider, something I\u2019d drink at home. This was no time for creature comforts.\
  \ This was the time to explore. \n\nThe easiest way to reach little Hay-on-Wye,\
  \ possibly the only way for a pair of Canadians leery of driving on the opposite\
  \ side of the road, was public transportation. There was something reassuring about\
  \ catching a bus in a foreign country. My mum and I could have been on our own street,\
  \ so familiar was the feeling of standing outside waiting to go somewhere else.\
  \ Recognizable characters populated the shaded stop. The teenager chatting on her\
  \ mobile phone, picking at her nail polish. The older businessman, no doubt averting\
  \ the next political disaster, as he tapped furiously on his upheld IPad. My mum\
  \ and I were the only ones out of place, simply standing contentedly in silence.\
  \ \n\nY Gelli Gandryll in Welsh, was a community of around 2,000 residents, renowned\
  \ internationally as A Town Of Books. There were over 20 bookshops. Even if that\u2019\
  s only 100 books in each bookshop, that\u2019s 2,000 books. Which meant there were\
  \ likely more books than people in Hay-on-Wye. This appealed to me immensely.\n\n\
  It was a beautifully quaint town. Like it belonged in a fairytale or daydream. Stepping\
  \ off the bus, we paused to take it in. Sloping green hills stretched past crumbling\
  \ ruins. The river Wye, languid as a slumbering deity. Cobblestone streets, where\
  \ people had twisted their ankles for hundreds of years. Stone buildings with stacks\
  \ that looked like they were hiding dancing chimney-sweeps. And the bookshops. Along\
  \ each delightful street was a bookshop offering every book imaginable. Open-air\
  \ bookshelves among castle ruins, paperbacks in the streets and mazes of tomes.\
  \ The entire town was a love letter to the written word. \n\nBut over the next few\
  \ days, I realized it wasn\u2019t just the books that created Hay-on-Wye. It was\
  \ the keepers of the town, people who lived and breathed it every day. They kept\
  \ the town alive. Breathed new life into it each day. The waiter at the Red Indigo.\
  \ He greeted us with open palms, his dark eyes and darker hair stringy and electrified.\
  \ He asked where my mum\u2019s husband was. This has happened often when my mum\
  \ and I travel alone. And I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last time. I\u2019\
  m sure until the end of time, whenever a woman walks alone, there will be someone\
  \ to ask her where her man is. But the waiter was in charge of our chicken masala\
  \ and we hadn\u2019t eaten since breakfast. So I watched my mum chat with him, using\
  \ reason and wit, fighting a smile. Slowly she charmed him into a begrudging ally.\
  \ I\u2019m always amazed at my mum\u2019s ability to connect with people. Suddenly\
  \ we learned about the waiter\u2019s own son, close to my age. His family\u2019\
  s dream of moving to Canada. We all talked about the best Indian restaurants in\
  \ Vancouver. We enjoyed the extra naan he brought to the table. We parted as friends,\
  \ when we started as strangers.  The housekeeper at The Swan Hotel. Bustling into\
  \ the room as I took a jet-lag nap, she clucked at me and asked if I needed any\
  \ hot tea. She called me dear. The jeweller we talked with one afternoon, who had\
  \ an affinity for gemstones and a distant cousin in our hometown. It was unexpected,\
  \ to realize that the people of Hay-On-Wye had as much to say as the books."
