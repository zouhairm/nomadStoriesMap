Text: "For me it seemed like any other ordinary day. The sun was shining a golden\
  \ yellow of promise, giving me the familiar wink that the South African sun tends\
  \ to do as if it is showing off. I nonchalantly winked back, accustomed to its mischief,\
  \ and carried on packing. Little did I know what I had in store for me as this was\
  \ the day of my first encounter of this little piece of heaven called Cape Town.\
  \ I arrived at my accommodation and I was greeted to what is now a familiar sound\
  \ of a \"taxi-driver\" (South African minibuses which are often illegally overloaded\
  \ and used for public transport) shouting a screeching \"Mowbray, Cape Town\". He\
  \ was indicating the destinations that he was travelling to as a sort of last call\
  \ for any would-be passengers, quite similar to the last boarding announcement at\
  \ the London Underground Railway Station. Ironically, the setting was in complete\
  \ contrast. Furthermore, I walked down the infamous Long Street and I was just amazed\
  \ by the diversity of culture on display. For a lifelong inhabitant of South Africa\
  \ to feel foreign in his own country just bears testament to how different Cape\
  \ Town is to the rest of South African. It is the closest thing to going to Europe\
  \ without having to bear the exorbitant travel costs due to tour limping currency.\
  \  In ten minutes I heard various different languages being spoken from my native\
  \ Xhosa, English, Afrikaans (A dutch dialect indigenous to South Africa), German\
  \ and even an Italian couple whom till this day am not sure were either excited\
  \ or quarreling.  \n\nIt was on my first excursion on the red double decker City\
  \ Sightseeing bus that I took full notice of the natural wonders that this city\
  \ has to offer. Mountains galore, with the chief of them all glaring at me with\
  \ pride. The Table Mountain fully deserves to be one of the seven natural wonders\
  \ of the world. Especially when there is a layer of clouds covering it, resulting\
  \ in what the locals have dubbed \"the table cloth\". Next we went to Boulder's\
  \ Beach where a colony of African penguins pass their time, we were lucky enough\
  \ to spot dolphins swimming not too far away and I envied the group of people who\
  \ had hired a canoe to get a close up experience. \n\nThe envy was short lived though,\
  \ as I indulged in the local cuisine called a \"Masala Steak Gatsby\", A sort of\
  \ over-sized sub filled with spicy masala sauce, pieces of steak and the usual greens,\
  \ that left my tummy giddy and content. Cape Town has the luxury of offering an\
  \ incredible variety of cuisines to choose from ranging from Cape Malay, Ethiopian,\
  \ African, German and even Asian food. Safe to say they do not discriminate against\
  \ any taste buds. The subsequent stop was the infamous Robben Island. A place that\
  \ has a dark history having imprisoned the great Nelson Mandela and fellow comrades\
  \ during the Apartheid regime.  Instead of sorrow, you get to feel more of a sense\
  \ of appreciation. This was a necessary experience as the beauty of Cape Town can\
  \ often leave one ignorant of the massive differences in income levels that are\
  \ present in the area and how far the country has come to be what it is today. \n\
  \nThese differences are to be embraced, as we noticed when we visited a \"tshisa\
  \ nyama\" (translated into 'burning meat' from Xhosa language) in a township called\
  \ Gugulethu, not too far from the CBD. South African house music was playing in\
  \ the background and tourists and locals alike were in jovial spirits, shaking what\
  \ their mothers gave them and enjoying flame grilled meat along with pap and chakalaka\
  \ sauce. It was amazing to see the kindness with which we were welcomed into their\
  \ community, not too mention that I was sharing a table with fellow tourists from\
  \ Mexico, Denmark, England and Congo and having an absolute ball. We danced till\
  \ our shoes were filled with dust, and our hearts with joy having little disregard\
  \ for the dangers that awaited us the next morning from having consumed African\
  \ beer.  \n\nCape Town, I thank you and I bid thee farewell."
