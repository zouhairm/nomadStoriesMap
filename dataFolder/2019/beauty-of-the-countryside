Text: A cold rainy day,we a group of childhood friend enjoying coffee in that weather
  and suddenly we struck by an idea.a trekking to the countryside.Boom next day at
  6'o clock in the morning,we packed our stuff and headed for dolkha(a small village
  far from city with a famous temple).our plan was to trek from dolkha to kalinchowk(a
  temple on the top of mountains).we reached dolkha by midnight by bus.we stayed in
  a lodge.all were exhausted and fell asleep right away.next morning we all wake up
  at around 7 and eat breakfast fast as possible.we start out trekking from dolkha
  to up in the mountains.as we go higher and higher,the surrounding becomes quieter
  and peace.finally i was far far way from home and the busy life of cities.we were
  walking through a narrow man made path.the first day of trek was good,we meet local
  people and some foreigner foreigners travelling like us.finally we reach local lodge
  at up in the mountains.our second day of trekking start with local meal which was
  delicious.all night we were comfortably sleep in the middle of the forest.2nd day
  going to be difficult because all day we have to climb the mountain.we start our
  day,we all knew we must reach kuri village by the night.it was little difficult.the
  roads,path and other stuff.as we go higher the view from there was breathtaking.all
  the small villages and towns and cold wind constantly blowing through your face.we
  do not waste any time,we knew we must reach before by night.at last we reach kuri
  village around 9 pm.we faced a little difficulty finding a room but we succeeded.that
  night we plan for bonfire and singing,dancing etc.the next day we were gonna reach
  our destination(kalinchowk).we all wake up at 4 in the morning to see the beautiful
  sunrise.it was so cold.the temperature was below minus.we all came outside wearing
  a blanket and get ready for 2 hour of staircase.(we were around 5 to 6 thousands
  meters up in the mountain).uff it was painful.but when we reach the top,view was
  absolutely stunning.the sunrise,i can't even describe how beautiful it was.all the
  efforts were worth it.it was on of the most beautiful moments of my life.that day
  i realized,when you want a break from your life,travel with friends to a unknown
  place no matter where it is,it will always brings you happiness and joy.sometimes
  it changes you to a good person.
