Text: "Year: 1948 | Place: Ladakh District, India. \nThe very first year of Indian\
  \ and Pakistani independence. In the middle hung the future of Jammu and Kashmir\
  \ by bullets. \n\nYear: 1962 | Place: Ladakh District, India. \nIndia has a new\
  \ neighbor, China, and the initial teething was more than just an adjustment issue.\
  \ For housewarming we received bloodshed. \n\nYear: 2017 | Place: Ladakh District,\
  \ India. \nThe minute I landed at Leh, the capital, I understood it was a jewel\
  \ worth fighting for. It is a good point to exclaim three facts. First, the state\
  \ of Jammu and Kashmir is still unstable due to tufts with Pakistan and China. Second,\
  \ the state is operated by the Indian Army. Third, my brother is an army Officer\
  \ posted at the Siachen Base in Ladakh. \n\nI spent the day acclimatizing to thinner\
  \ air. By the night I was an inquisitive traveller. I strolled through the local\
  \ market to visit a tiny cafe that my brother had explored during his time there.\
  \ Sitting next to a small bonfire, I sipped on a spicy thupka dish, a combination\
  \ of flat noodles, dimsums and pok Choi in clear soup, silently awaiting the oncoming.\
  \ \n\nThis brings me to my next set of facts. Here on, I had no clue about my journey.\
  \ All I knew was that every destination on my route was roughly a 10-12 hour drive\
  \ away, and that I was about to see Ladakh the military way. With this I set off\
  \ into the heart of the district. \n\nMy first stop was Gurdwara Pathar Sahib, a\
  \ Sikh temple, to take the Almighty's blessings before starting my journey. My adventure\
  \ began at Pangong Tso, a massive lake and bearer of borders of India and China.\
  \ Stepping into the water is a punishable offense for civilians, but here I was\
  \ on an Indian patrolling boat, charting these mesmerizing blue hues and face to\
  \ face with Chinese military. About when I thought this was an experience of a lifetime,\
  \ I found myself on a road never heard of, midst nothing but barren land and small\
  \ hills on both sides. It was turning darker by the hour, the road conditions worsening,\
  \ and no sight of another vehicle in our visual range. My driver sensed my worry,\
  \ and explained that we were in a tactical zone. On our left were Chinese foothills,\
  \ and Indian on the right. Also that we were under both armies surveillance. As\
  \ reassuring as this was, I was relieved on arriving at a small army station, Neyoma,\
  \ our halt for the night. With an exhausted body, hungry stomach and no network\
  \ or GPS, I decided to completely surrender. I woke up the next morning to the sound\
  \ of cavalry tanks. An officer saw as I stood gazing at these royal machines, and\
  \ was offered a ride! From dreaming of dune bashing on an RTV to that on a tank,\
  \ this was an unimaginable experience. \n\nWe left that afternoon for Nubra Valley.\
  \ The pass connecting the two valleys is the world's highest motorable road, Khardung\
  \ La. Another check on the bucket list, perhaps. In the wake of dawn, I sat in the\
  \ calm, watching lhamas swooping through dunes of white sand against the sunset.\
  \ It was a moment of introspection, and almost felt like I was meditating. \n\n\
  Next morning I was off to the next stop, lake Tso Moriri. A little insider knowledge:\
  \ the bumpier the journey, the better the destination. So on a ride more bumpy,\
  \ I discovered the might of Kyagar Tso and Tso Moriri. To my surprise and joy, I\
  \ was the only one there besides a few locals. I took the opportunity to befriend\
  \ a few strangers, who enthusiastically recited old folklore.\n\nI was now headed\
  \ to the peak of my journey, quite literally, the Siachin Glacier. From a distance,\
  \ I could hear chants of young officers, prepping and training for their climb upward\
  \ to the Line of Control. Standing at the foot of a historically violent scene,\
  \ my feelings were mixed. As I paid homage to the war deceased, I turned around\
  \ to see only courage and laughter of the young soldiers, ready to sacrifice their\
  \ lives if they had to, all in the name of motherland. \n\nMy leap into the unknown\
  \ exposed me to knowledge I'd hoped to gain on this pilgrim land. Perhaps, every\
  \ extra mile and bump was worth it."
