Text: "This interview is with a man I met during my sales job as a door knocker for\
  \ a solar company. \nIt was a hot day in the suburbs of Byron bay. Before I knocked\
  \ on this specific door, I had no idea I would meet Afro Moses. A man who grew up\
  \ in the poorest conditions of Ghana and made his way up. He\u2019s a multi \u2013\
  \ Award winner, plays 15 instruments, makes reggae funk music and works as a motivational\
  \ speaker. He reached the peak of his career in 2004 when he got nominated for an\
  \ Oscar. This story is about his message to the new world based on his experiences\
  \ through life.\n Me: \u201C Following what you love, making music and especially\
  \ coming out of poor conditions from Ghana to Europe was obviously a huge journey\
  \ for you. Did you ever come to steps in your life where you faced failure? What\
  \ is your personal philosophy to life? \u201D Afro Moses: \u201C Well in Life you\
  \ need to jump. This is my personal philosophy. In Ghana they teach you about Christianity.\
  \ Or at least that there is something called God. Religion did a lot of bad things,\
  \ but good things as well. They tried to teach me that there is a God in the sky.\
  \ But when I grew up, I found out for me it\u2019s not in the sky. Its a spirit\
  \ that is in myself and it is in everything. Its not about someone who is watching\
  \ you, which is what I got taught in the start. Life will always be up and down.\
  \ When I grew up, I, for example struggled, a lot. My family had no money. Today\
  \ I can go to university and teach African music. This is amazing. You asked me,\
  \ how do I keep on going in tough moments. Well, when I felt down, I always focused\
  \ on some things. The spirit of Love in myself, but also doing what I loved. My\
  \ inner fire is the music and this always kept me going. Everyone has that, but\
  \ it can be something different for everyone. Another thing I found out is that\
  \ even in Life, to my own ideology, before you jump you bent down. This means when\
  \ you come down it\u2019s not the end of the world. You need to jump.\u201C Me:\
  \ \u201CWhen you were around 20 years old you went through depression. How did you\
  \ overcome it?\u201D Afro Moses: \u201C Yes I lived in Denmark during that time.\
  \ I moved there originally because I believed what people told me. That I need a\
  \ house to live secure. I taught music at a college and earned a lot of money. But\
  \ I came from Ghana where it was very warm and in Denmark it was very cold. The\
  \ streets were quiet. And I felt like I was dead. Also when I lived in Denmark,\
  \ I felt like I wasn\u2019t allowed to be happy. Because you see on Tv how people\
  \ in Africa die. \nBut being sad and miserable will not heal anyone. I went back\
  \ to Ghana, and this healed me. The young spirit of the people made me feel alive\
  \ again.\u201D \nMe: \u201CWhat do you feel inside yourself when you make music?\u201D\
  \ Afro Moses: \u201CSometimes I feel myself  and sometimes I feel other people\u2019\
  s emotions and spirit. And this is what I bring forward in my music. I learned people\
  \ sometimes don\u2019t like to see themselves. Their inner self. When I was younger\
  \ I didn\u2019t like to see myself in the mirror. So when I sing how I see them.\
  \ I am a mirror to them.\u201D Afro, has a message to all the young people out there\
  \ and I think it\u2019s important to share: \u201CThink of what you actually want.\
  \ You have to find out where you belong. Its good for example to sit down and think\
  \ of your childhood days. Ask your parents how you acted what you liked what you\
  \ didn\u2019t like. Your childhood days are the purest moments of your life. No\
  \ expectations just one expectation: being happy and healthy. Doing what you want.\
  \ This is what we need to focus on. Doing what we want to, deep inside of us."
