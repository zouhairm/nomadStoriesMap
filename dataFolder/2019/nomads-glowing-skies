Text: "I was always fascinated by the images of the nomads in the middle of the steppes,\
  \ with their yurts and horses and nothing around. And then in Kyrgyzstan I finally\
  \ met them, or actually, I met the semi-nomads. In the summer, from May to August,\
  \ they pack up their belongings and set up warm, colorful yurts that smell like\
  \ lamb somewhere in the green mountains, where dozens or hundreds or thousands of\
  \ cows and horses and sheep can roam freely and enjoy an endless supply of grass.\n\
  In the \u201Ckitchen yurt\u201D there is always a stove with fire, and chai and\
  \ fresh bread and homemade jam and Kaymak - a very creamy cream they make with some\
  \ device that separates the milk. There is also a large wooden barrel full of mare's\
  \ milk that they mix with a large wooden spoon, mixing and mixing until it is fermented\
  \ and becomes the \"Kumis\". The result is a very strong taste of milk and yeast\
  \ (floating in the glass) and all that is a little fizzy. Yummy. But the truth is\
  \ that Kumis has many medical qualities and in one of the villages where we stayed\
  \ we met a Kyrgyz family who came for a \"Kumis retreat\". They drink a glass of\
  \ Kumis several times a day, breathe clear mountain air and clean their systems.\
  \ They were disappointed to hear that we were drinking coffee instead.\nIn the \u201C\
  bedroom yurt\u201D you'll find mattresses spread all over the floor covered with\
  \ a decent number of blankets that weigh a lot, and dry animal dung burning in the\
  \ stove that spreads heat and the smell of burnt hair. There is also a radio and\
  \ some even have a TV. As we lay under the heavy blankets and smelled the poop burning,\
  \ we heard our host family laughing in front of the television.\nThe children know\
  \ how to ride horses and donkeys, they jump and climb over them and are sent to\
  \ fetch some stray cows or sheep. They play with a little lamb that for some reason\
  \ naps in the kitchen yurt, warming up near the stove. They ride their bicycle in\
  \ the heart of these green hills and play and play and also help their parents all\
  \ the time, mixing the home-made jam that is absolutely the best in the world and\
  \ serving tea for the foreigners who have been invited to rest for a while. And\
  \ one child with a booklet of paintings and words in English and Kyrgyz takes the\
  \ opportunity to learn and to teach us how to say rain and horse and tomorrow. He\
  \ also watches a video in his mother's iPhone showing Western children terrified\
  \ of animals like ducks or cats, and bursts with laughter.\nThen in the winter they\
  \ fold up the whole camp and go back to their house in the village or town or even\
  \ in the city. It's too cold and too snowy and there are no tourists. And the animals\
  \ return to their buildings and the people go back into their houses and their hot\
  \ showers and the children return to their friends and dancing classes.\nAnd I wonder\
  \ how it feels to live in two different worlds, in the summer here and in the winter\
  \ there. And what does it do to a family, how do you suddenly make a switch from\
  \ the yurt and the closeness and intensity to the separateness and privacy of the\
  \ house. What happens when they come home? And after they all sleep together on\
  \ one floor, do the children manage to fall asleep at night without the whole family\
  \ close to them, and what do the parents do with all the intimacy that is suddenly\
  \ out there at nights? And how do the animals get along without all the fresh grass?\
  \ Do they all miss the nights with millions of stars in the sky? I wonder if they\
  \ have these glowing star stickers that we put on the ceilings, I wonder if anyone\
  \ buys them in this country where everyone knows exactly how glowing real skies\
  \ look like."
