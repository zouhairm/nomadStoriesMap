Text: "I\u2019m speeding tandem on a motor bike fast enough to create the illusion\
  \ of a night\u2019s breeze, a welcomed break from the thick hot jungle air. As we\
  \ round a corner, our headlights illuminate a stray dog in the middle of the road,\
  \ eyes rabid, panting as if pleading to be taken out by one of our bikes. I swerve\
  \ to the left, dodging the creature and continue closer to our unfamiliar destination:\
  \ Bali's Pasar Gianyar Night Market. \n\nThe market is just a 40 minute ride from\
  \ the center of Ubud where my friends and I have been staying. Hosting over 3 million\
  \ tourists a year and a large ex-pat community, central Ubud has more foreigners\
  \ than locals, catering to them with hippy chic shops, trendy restaurants, and villa\
  \ inspired accommodation. While starting my trip here was undeniably a nice introduction,\
  \ I was ready to experience some Balinese culture beyond the microcosm of a tourist\
  \ haven.  \n\nWe slow our bikes when we spot the market. The parking lot is full,\
  \ but there are few tourists, or bule as Indonesians would say, to be seen. I hop\
  \ off my bike buzzing, the energy is palpable. Crowds wearing a mix of traditional\
  \ and modern clothes flock to colorful stalls behind picnic tables. The set ups\
  \ are simple: one to three people prepare food under a sign listing the menu items.\
  \ It\u2019s a far cry from the trendy offerings of central Ubud, but judging from\
  \ the beaming customers, the food here is just as good, if not better.\n\nThe familiar\
  \ scent of fried batter narrows my attention to a cart selling gorengan, an assortment\
  \ of fritters. \u201CBoleh minta enam,\u201D I order for the group. Pleased to hear\
  \ me order in bahasa Indonesian, the man hands over a bag of fritters for 1,000\
  \ rupiah a piece, around 7 cents in my home currency. I go in for my first bite\
  \ of pisang gorgeng, fried banana, when my foot trips over a wrapper and pulls my\
  \ attention towards the flattened brown garbage that litters the sidewalk\u2019\
  s edge. The trash looks too old to be just the night's, the market is clearly affected\
  \ by Indonesia\u2019s waste problem. I shift my thoughts back to my food and keep\
  \ walking. \n\nWe stop next under a banner with a personified chicken foot and painfully\
  \ twisted chill pepper for our main meal.  The stall is owned by a kind Balinese\
  \ woman in a pink t-shirt named Wayan. Explaining each dish in detail, she helps\
  \ us chose a selection. She\u2019s friendly and takes interest in us, wondering\
  \ where we\u2019re from and what we\u2019ve done so far in Bali. I ask her if she\u2019\
  s from nearby. \u201CI live very close, with my daughter and my sister,\u201D she\
  \ gestures towards the other women cooking. \u201CWe\u2019re here every weekend.\u201D\
  \n\nWayan brings the food to our table, treating us like we're guests in her home.\
  \ She stays a while and waits for our reaction to the ikan baker gourami, a traditional\
  \ grilled spiced fish. \u201CEnak sekali!\u201D we echo each other, assuring her\
  \ it\u2019s \u201Cvery delicious\u201D - and it is. Tasting of chilies and turmeric,\
  \ we savor each bite, stripping the fish down to the bones.    \n\nWe say bye with\
  \ selemat malam and enter the next fluorescent lit alley. Here we explore stands\
  \ selling traditional goods such as patterned sarongs and intricately woven offerings\
  \ for the Hindu gods. There are also many stands selling items I\u2019d find at\
  \ markets back home like knock-off Adidas apparel and cheap sunglasses. In the row,\
  \ I spy a man with a colorful display of jarred gummies serving es campur, literally\
  \ translating to \u201Cmixed ice.\u201D I didn\u2019t save room for dessert, but\
  \ I have to try this. The man scoops up treats from each jar, combines them into\
  \ a bowl of ice, and tops off the concoction with condensed milk. I dive in my spoon\
  \ for a sugar ride characterized by the textures of chewy gummies and crunchy ice.\
  \ It\u2019s a sweet ending to the night.   \n\nAmbling back to our bikes, I leave\
  \ the night market full to my heart\u2019s content. I had tasted delicious food,\
  \ chatted with friendly people, and best of all, experienced a true local\u2019\
  s night out in Bali."
