Text: "The doorbell rings. A soft red blurs beneath my wine glass. We push away from\
  \ the table; our visitors have finally arrived.\n\nDown the hall and past a series\
  \ of cryptic locks, my host throws the light and pulls back the door. I shift, my\
  \ hands drop lower. I\u2019m eager. Too eager, nervous about making a good impression.\
  \ I tilt forward to better display the bowl gripped tight between my fingers. We\u2019\
  ve finished our meal and a full bottle of Merlot, waiting through the twilight for\
  \ the rain to pass. Only now, they have come to sing.\n\nTheir paper lanterns flicker\
  \ and bounce off a canopy of umbrellas keeping watch nearby. A dozen children stand\
  \ before us, neighbourhood classmates of the girl who lives next door. We are their\
  \ first stop. I grin as they begin a song so earnestly memorized.\n\n\u201CLeuk!\
  \ Goed gedaan!\u201D My voice lilts, foreign in the brisk November air. Careful,\
  \ encouraging words I have rehearsed in my mind.\n\nNow it is my turn - a role I\
  \ am assured, with a wink, is more critical than what one might experience at Halloween\
  \ back home. I begin to dole out chocolatey tokens of appreciation one at a time,\
  \ measured and modest. Swayed by these sweet faces and bright-shining eyes, the\
  \ last of the crinkling silver wrappers slip easily from my bowl.\n\nThis group\
  \ will be getting all the candy we bought for Sint Maarten\u2019s Day, the evening\
  \ grown long and stretching closer to bedtime. Ours is but one song on their journey\
  \ and the children are gone as quick as they arrived - off to grace another narrow\
  \ doorway between downpours. Knowing this clear moment is brief, we grab umbrellas\
  \ of our own and head into the darkened street.\n\nAn afternoon of drizzle has saturated\
  \ the landscape, and the ink of night deepens Amsterdam\u2019s golds and greys to\
  \ shadow. The threat of rain feels imminent, but you grow accustomed to its inevitability.\
  \ Like navigating these busy cobblestone streets, it is best to move as the city\
  \ moves - natural, assured. Prepared to step forward, around and through.\n\nWe\
  \ catch a cool-lit tram as the first droplets hit. The buildings become a backdrop.\
  \ Crisp panels of lights shimmer between rivulets on the glass, lapping along canal\
  \ walls, smeared on the Amstel River like wet oil paint. Neighbourhoods grow smaller\
  \ and nightlife swells. We swim against the crowd and into the theatre, heavy in\
  \ red, its velvet panels pushed back from a panoramic view of the skyline. Music\
  \ floats from the stage below and we lean in; one set, as fluid and complexly blended\
  \ as the streets lining the waterfront.\n\nOur plans take us higher. We move to\
  \ the river, next to swift, buzzing bicycle lanes and boats docked in silence behind\
  \ the rail. On the ferry across, and as we make our way up a glass-walled elevator,\
  \ I reflect on the quiet and confident flow of the city. It begins with the neon\
  \ hum of the red-light district and stretches along stony-walled canals lined with\
  \ vibrant doors and swaying houseboats. It widens further still, until you\u2019\
  ve left everything behind in search of hazy green landscapes dotted by windmills.\
  \ Amsterdam is born of the sea, bathed in timelessness and a graceful wisdom that\
  \ comes from centuries of experience.\n\nI have circled through grand parks and\
  \ towering, gilded museums. I have moved along waterways and bridges, breathing\
  \ in their reflections and letting my thoughts pass over me, only to wash away like\
  \ the tide. I came to Amsterdam burdened with emotional ballast - caught in a current\
  \ between the past and present. Through its eyes, I have discovered the value in\
  \ honouring these moments while learning to move beyond them, free to see the larger\
  \ picture.\n\nFar above the water, I see these details as their sum and they glitter\
  \ like a wave blurring gently into midnight. Nightcap in hand, slow strains of jazz\
  \ filtered through dim light, I drift on visions of a city that has gifted me a\
  \ sense of presence and peace I did not expect to find."
