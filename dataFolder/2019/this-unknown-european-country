Text: This little ountry sided on the west of Balkan, lays out the east coast of Adriatic
  and Ionion sea. The county is a beautiful combination of sea coast and mountains.
  All the west part of the country is bordered by the sea. When would you like to
  go there, what would you like to do there.... everything. If you are looking for
  mountain walks and jogging you have it, if you are looking for beautiful beaches
  with wonderful romantic sunset ...oh yes that's the place, if you are looking for
  delicious food you can have in all the cities you go, night life of course the best.
  The country if free and open to many tourists. From May to October you may enjoy
  the wonderful weather and swimming in the breathtaking beaches of the Ionian Sea.
  Enjoy the sea and go to eat in the mountain...that's Albania. Very easy reachable
  and quite cheap in comparison of many top Mediterranean countries. The country offers
  great escursion in the Alps and you may enjoy the Osumi Canions with kayak tours
  through the river with the same name. It's an undiscovered pearl in Mediterranean
  with combination of sea fro north to south, beaches, mountain clime, great delicious
  Mediterranean kitchen, traditional cooking, very nice people, night life starting
  from the one in the capital city of Tirana. You also have a lot to learn from the
  history of the country, previously closed and now quite open to integration. Very
  open minded people, full of interest and eager to be at the level of a European
  country.
