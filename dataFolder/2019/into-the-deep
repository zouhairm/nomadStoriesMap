Text: "I had spent the better part of that day driving along the highway trying to\
  \ find the perfect beach. The day had not gone as I had planned. After enduring\
  \ a late start, adrenaline-pumping traffic, and a few pit stops at some lackluster\
  \ beaches, I found myself on the road once again.\n \nIt was approaching late afternoon\
  \ by this time and while the sun still had yet to set, I was anxious about the time\
  \ that had already passed.\n \nEarlier that month, I had booked the trip as a sort\
  \ of a private respite from the chaos of daily life. I was feeling cloistered and\
  \ I needed to get out to the open calling of the ocean. I wanted to surf, relax,\
  \ and be free. In my mind\u2019s eye, the water would offer me a sort of serenity\
  \ that been missing in the drudgery of my day-to-day. I had never been to Hawaii\
  \ nor had I tried surfing yet my inexperience with both failed to phase me.  \n\
  \ \nPulling the car to the side of the road, I pulled out my GPS and plugged in\
  \ the address of a beach I had saved. I glided along the highway where I saw breathtaking\
  \ views of mountains draped in lush foliage and an ocean that never stopped glittering\
  \ in the sun.\n \nAnd finally, I was there.\n \nI looked toward the expanse of ocean\
  \ which went on further and more infinitely than my eyes could ever see. I saw its\
  \ waves cascading down in perfect rhythm. Forceful, yet manageable, I thought. I\
  \ laid down my belongings and made my way toward the water with my board.\n \nThe\
  \ water was cold, colder than I expected. I stepped in deeper, trying to acclimate\
  \ to the water. I climbed the board, trying to remember all the steps from a tutorial\
  \ I had watched. It wasn\u2019t successful, as I fell sideways, but I felt motivated\
  \ to try again all the same. With an eye on the incoming wave, I positioned myself\
  \ on the board, ready to take it head on.\n \nAt some point, it all went wrong.\
  \ I was suddenly underwater, salt water coursing through my nostrils into my lungs.\
  \ It was carrying the whole weight of me and I was hurtling in every which direction\
  \ . I was at the mercy of the ocean. The only lucid thought I had during this moment\
  \ was to brace for impact.\n \nAnd then, somehow, it was over.\n \nBut only for\
  \ a moment. While my head was no longer under water, I knew another intense wave\
  \ would be following shortly, making it imperative for me to get out of the water.\
  \ My body felt uncharacteristically heavy, as if I was being weighed down by several\
  \ anvils. My legs felt little better and I suspected they might collapse if they\
  \ had to bear the weight of my torso. There was also the matter of residual water\
  \ still in my lungs.\n \nMiraculously, I moved. Now away from the torrential and\
  \ unforgiving waves, I walked slowly toward my makeshift beach station, still shaken\
  \ by the ordeal. When I reached my towel, I cast the board to the wayside and sunk\
  \ into the sand, knees first. I reconfigured the position of my body and looked\
  \ toward the ocean.\n \nThe waves no longer looked inviting. From this vantage point,\
  \ I felt utterly foolish at how naive I had been to underestimate the intensity\
  \ of the ocean. It was beautiful, yes, but it was also a powerful, cataclysmic force\
  \ capable of swallowing whole coastal cities. Knocking me off my board was a given.\n\
  \ \nAt that point, the disconnect hit me. I was entirely removed from nature and\
  \ my understanding of it had been shallow at best, something whose severe effects\
  \ I had mostly observed on TV. In my quest for a destination vacation, I had reduced\
  \ nature to mere ornamentation. As beautiful as nature is, it is also a powerful\
  \ and overwhelming force whose sheer magnitude escapes many of us.\n\nAs I sat there\
  \ in contemplation, I felt the residual ocean water in the back of mouth. I swallowed\
  \ it, the salt sliding down my throat forever reminding me of the indelible lesson\
  \ it had left me."
