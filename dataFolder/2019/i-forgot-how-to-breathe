Text: "We walked down the red-orange cobblestone path laughing for the pure joy of\
  \ it. Basking in the beautiful sunshine on our faces. Imagining what the courtyard\
  \ to the center of St. Albans town was like back in 1300s? We passed an ancient\
  \ pub that had almost been there since the 1300s and you could hear the jolly laughter\
  \ of the patrons within, enjoy a delicious pint of something golden. Then we took\
  \ a left and walked a bit downhill, past beautiful gardens blooming with all things\
  \ floral, past men in adorable hats with their canine partner out for a walk and\
  \ you could sense the peace before you saw it. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect it. As we\
  \ rounded the corner I abruptly came to a halt and forgot how to breathe. Before\
  \ me was the most beautiful, ornate and grand cathedral I had ever seen. Granted,\
  \ being a midwestern, my cathedral surveys were limited but still\u2026.. it was\
  \ holy. Mystical, if you aren\u2019t quite that religious. All this, built to be\
  \ a beacon of hope in a dark time. \nAs we entered the cathedral before my eyes\
  \ danced the stories of thousands of pilgrims who sought something here. Etched\
  \ into the 100 foot columns were the names of those who would be remembered. Tapestry\
  \ and stain glass windows sung out, spoke of beauty and pain. Candles, waiting to\
  \ be lit for someone you wanted to remember, stood waiting. People walked about\
  \ in a hushed and reverential way. There was too much here not to feel something.\
  \ You knew you couldn't leave this place without knowing you would be changed. And\
  \ so I lit a candle, paid honor to the people before me; the martyr of St. Albans\
  \ who protected it from attack, the men and women who built the cathedral and the\
  \ people who would come after me. \nAnd as we left, I turned back and understood\
  \ that I was a part of world and it was big and vast. That everyone was searching\
  \ for something, whether it be hope, love or peace and I was not alone. And then,\
  \ I took a breath."
