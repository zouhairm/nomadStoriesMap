Text: "There are places which make you feel truly complete in body and soul, a year\
  \ ago I decided to volunteer in my neighbor country Costa Rica, mostly  known for\
  \ its beaches and green landscapes. I had the opportunity to share a capsule of\
  \ my life with the people from the indigenous community of Bribripa, located in\
  \ the indigenous territory of Salitre in the Puntareanas province, only about a\
  \ 7 hour bus ride and a taxi away from the Capital San Jose. The indigenous people\
  \ of Bribripa are known as Bribris, I had the immense pleasure of sharing a capsule\
  \ of my life with people who made me feel fulfilled, aside from their kindness and\
  \ community life, they taught me to be appreciative of the normality of everyday\
  \ life.\nDaily life consisted of getting up at 4:30 am to climb up La Sabana in\
  \ order to get a view of the sunrise, bets started to arise regarding the time at\
  \ which the sun was going to set (I lost). Going down that hill was not an easy\
  \ feat, slipping was not uncommon, but it was also not rare to go down with sense\
  \ joy and gratitude for the big plate of breakfast awaiting on the Bribripa community\
  \ center to get you through the morning, usually made up of Gallopinto (a mix of\
  \ rice and beans) made by locals and mostly with produce cultivated 100% organically\
  \ by them.\nProduce came in its majority from la finca de Don Cosme, which was another\
  \ climb up the hill kind of place in order to get to. Don Cosme is probably the\
  \ happiest human I've met, he'll gladly and proudly explain how he manages to cultivate\
  \ his crop 100% organically with the help of his teenage twin sons and the new adventures\
  \ he's taking on, such as creating a pond to raise fish. But the thing that gave\
  \ me the biggest lesson is the way he explains with such care and passion his sustainable\
  \ way of life in a family led community while sharing a little of his fresh bananas\
  \ and pineapples.\nA 20-minute walk down from the Bribripa community center is the\
  \ river which is perfect for swimming and resting after a walk under the Costa Rican\
  \ sun. At every moment of the day you can enjoy the natural orchestra of the Cicadas\
  \ and when you go down a tree you'll feel the light splashing of their pee, magical\
  \ right? But if the Cicadas compose the most amazing music, at nigh you'll enjoy\
  \ the real show, the magnificent and vast sky, which if you stare at long enough\
  \ you'll start to feel as if it\u2019s dragging you towards it.\nClimbing one of\
  \ the mountains surrounding the community of Bribripa is a real test to your resilience\
  \ and resistance as you\u2019ll go through a forest untouched by men with no clear\
  \ indications of where to place your foot and will have to take a double look to\
  \ check for curious reptiles around. Climbing this mountain has to be guided by\
  \ a local as they are the only ones who know the area by heart, this also gave me\
  \ the chance to get to know the Bribris a bit more as throughout this walk no loud\
  \ noises were aloud since these woods are considered sacred to them. \nLiving in\
  \ and indigenous community with not only the locals, but also with 20 other volunteers\
  \ from different parts of the world suddenly makes you realize that your city and\
  \ adulthood life problems are not as big as they seem. Some people are just happy\
  \ and make the best with what they are given, these are people who live in the moment\
  \ but don't forget about the footprint they\u2019ll set for future generations as\
  \ they take action to live sustainably. You go to these places hoping to help people,\
  \ until you realize that the one that needed the most help was yourself."
