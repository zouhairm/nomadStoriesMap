Text: "I disembark in Mexico City with a pocket full of warnings from well-meaning\
  \ friends, and a head full of my mother shrilly exclaiming that my penchant for\
  \ solo travel will be the death of her. I take a deep breath and feel my ears pop.\
  \ Nobody remembers to warn you about the altitude around here - at almost 8000ft\
  \ above sea-level, it's not for the faint of heart. I join the throng of my fellow\
  \ travellers escaping the winter, smiling as the disgruntled comments flow around\
  \ me. Yes it\u2019s humid, yes it\u2019s sticky, and yes Canadian airports are more\
  \ organized. But we\u2019re in Mexico City. Breathe. I make eye contact with an\
  \ older couple in front of me. They smile back and tell me they\u2019re heading\
  \ up to San Miguel for a month of exploration, reaping the rewards of their retirement\
  \ plan. I tell them I\u2019m here to celebrate my birthday and they wish me well\
  \ before a smiling officer beckons to them and I lose them to the light beyond the\
  \ exit. When my turn comes he mistakes me for a local and switches to Spanish. I\
  \ explain, using rudimentary phrases gleaned off television, that I speak English,\
  \ and he apologizes, exclaiming that I look local. He stamps my passport and waves\
  \ me through with a \u2018Happy Birthday.\u2019 It throws me until I remember he\u2019\
  s just seen my passport. My trepidation at being alone in Mexico eases, shrugging\
  \ a layer of the horror stories from friends and family back home, none of whom\
  \ had ever actually step foot here. I exit, hand luggage in tow, to locate the driver\
  \ sent by my hotel to pick me up. He\u2019s waiting, smartly dressed, bearing a\
  \ sign with my name. Introducing himself as Luis, he insists on helping me and settles\
  \ me in for the ride with a bottle of water. His chatter in hard-learned English\
  \ fills the car as we ride, pointing out landmarks and food stalls that surely rival\
  \ any Michelin star. Belatedly he realizes I might be tired from the flight, apologizing\
  \ for his conversation. I wave him off, thoroughly enjoying the experience. He\u2019\
  s only too happy to resume and I\u2019m a little sad to finally arrive at the hotel\
  \ - a gorgeously appointed boutique of suites nestled in the carcass of a formerly\
  \ wealthy villa - with an entirely new perspective. My haphazard Instagram gleaned\
  \ mental itinerary had been reassigned with what he assured me was the real Mexico\
  \ City.\n\u2018Speak to concierge, miss,\u2019 he suggests earnestly. \u2018She\
  \ will say to me to drive you one day. All places. One price.\u2019 He gestures,\
  \ emphatic that it will be the best tour. Caution thrown to the wind, I can\u2019\
  t help but discard those well-intentioned warnings. My mother\u2019s voice, still\
  \ shrill, sounds so far away. I check in, and ask Concierge if I can arrange a tour\
  \ the next day. She pulls out pamphlets for bus tours, private tours, guided tours,\
  \ but none of them sound as enticing as Itinerary Luis. I mention it and she arranges\
  \ a price, pleasantly surprised that I, alone, am willing to entrust a local to\
  \ show me around. I head to bed, shooting off a quick message to reassure my mother\
  \ that I still breathe air on earth.\nWe start with fresh juice and pastry from\
  \ a quaint cafe enroute to the pyramids.  We pass where Luis grew up, he detours\
  \ so I can glimpse Frieda Kahlo\u2019s Casa Azul, a whirlwind through Chapultepec,\
  \ tacos at a locally renowned stand and a gander at the Angel before returning.\n\
  As we approach, I notice the blue lights flashing. An ambulance is flanked by police\
  \ cars as they march a handcuffed young man out of the hotel. He\u2019s yelling\
  \ at them belligerently, drunk or high or both. His family is crowded on the sidewalk,\
  \ father sternly yelling at an officer who refuses to budge. I\u2019m about to ask\
  \ Luis what could have happened but I\u2019m startled to see him almost tearing\
  \ up. Before I can say anything, he softly explains.\n\u2018This, miss, is what\
  \ you see in your televisions tomorrow. In America. Not the museums. No parks. Just\
  \ drugs and evil Mexicans.\u2019"
