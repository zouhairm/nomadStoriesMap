Text: "24, december, 2018, end of a 6 months relationship. The last day that we talked\
  \ he told me about one Company looking for english talkers to teach meditation.\
  \ He saw on the walls of his job, he is mandarim teacher  in one of the most famous\
  \ colleges in Rio... Well i didnt want to ask him again to look for the telephone\
  \ number, so I asked my friend that study there... So finally I went to a Buddist\
  \ temple to do a meditation class to teach, Very Nice! I arrived one week before\
  \ the class s\xF3 I visited BKK, when I back 2 days before the course, i saw one\
  \ base of an army, time to wake up, everybody wearing same clothes,  listening a\
  \ Very borring mantra everytime, so I couldnt stay one year living like this...\
  \ I made a friend in BKK, so I asked him to help me, se talked than I thought, \"\
  \ i don't want to stay here anymore\", so I had to talk to 2 Monks and he waited\
  \ me 2 h outside, Finally I Said: I just wanna back, ok!? So as a action movie we\
  \ went to downtown of BKK. Thee Thai guy showed me BKK, It was amazing feeling completly\
  \ Free, following my one rules, after this situation i discored that I want  to\
  \ live travelling without destiny and my destiny  is have no destiny. \nI broke\
  \ all Patterns of my own mind, I want to see all differences of the world that connected\
  \ us..."
