Text: "Plane landed. What was I doing in a completely strange country?\nI did not\
  \ know that one day I would call it home. It was July 2015 that my journey through\
  \ Budapest began. My mission: study and live for a year in a country I had hardly\
  \ heard of. Do you think Paris is the city of lights? No, Budapest is. The city\
  \ of yellow lights. \nThe journey began in late summer, and I did not know that\
  \ a European city could be so hot. Summer is full of life! Picnics in the parks,\
  \ people smiling while sitting in the grass, bars and crowded streets. Then fall.\
  \ \nThe city of lights was colored with orange leaves. The Statue of Liberty wrapped\
  \ in orange. The old trams are a relic that passed before my eyes every day. The\
  \ older, the more charming. I felt like I was in an old and fancy movie, but with\
  \ much more life. Later came the winter. \nI did not know that the snow could turn\
  \ me into a child who discovered a new toy. The pleasure of my day was to walk on\
  \ the streets with no goal, only to form an ice ball with my hands and throw it\
  \ up. It was in the winter that I discovered more Hungarian flavors. Christmas fairs\
  \ seemed to have the gift to make all of us part of the culture. I was also struck\
  \ by how Hungarians are proud of their history, exalting in each monument their\
  \ important leaders. A monument was peculiar to me - the statue of the anonymous\
  \ writer, alone, nameless and faceless, sitting on the edge of a castle. With all\
  \ these characteristics, it is able to arouse the curiosity of who passes by the\
  \ place. A violinist complements the mystery around the tourists. Curious how, suddenly,\
  \ spring was made. \nThe anonymous was filled with flowers all around. Was he happier\
  \ with the arrival of so many colors? The nightlife of the city awoke again. People\
  \ of all ages would gather anywhere to watch their football team. The trams were\
  \ closed so everyone could move freely around the streets. It was a smiling, colorful\
  \ crowd. Besides the colors of the flowers, there were also the red, white and green\
  \ of the flags. \nFour seasons well defined, which showed me what it is to be inserted\
  \ in another culture as if it were yours. Four seasons that showed me that the world\
  \ is there to be discovered. That along the journey we have a lot to learn. Every\
  \ taste, every smell and every color is eternalized in memory. Four seasons that\
  \ made who I am today. This cultural baggage belongs only to those who have opportunities\
  \ like this. Traveling transforms you from the inside out, in ways you did not even\
  \ know that were possible. It makes you to want to live more and more experiences\
  \ like that. It drives you to want to relate these experiences to everyone around\
  \ you, because everyone should know the world as it really is, not as people think\
  \ it is."
