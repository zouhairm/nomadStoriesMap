Text: "This story is about the inevitable journey you make when you go from a happy\
  \ moment to a trauma. This unnatural movement between happy-traumatic moments are\
  \ also traveling stories. \nRecently I've run into the habit of starting in the\
  \ same way in several stories: \"In September of 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by a\
  \ category 5 hurricane, Hurricane Mar\xEDa.\" The reality is that despite having\
  \ a memory of one or another hurricane in my childhood this, without a doubt, will\
  \ be one I will never forget. The shortage of electricity that crossed Puerto Rico\
  \ had many implications, but one of the most precarious situations was the shortage\
  \ of food. Puerto Rico was desperate, and I felt that desperation. The food was\
  \ rationed more and more because we had to wait for supplies to arrive from the\
  \ United States (or for Trump to realize that we existed in order to send them)\
  \ and consequently my diet to change radically. The beginning of the day was at\
  \ 6 am when the sun came out and it was amazing because for quite some time I did\
  \ not get up with the sun. In this time several routines were formed: get up, take\
  \ a bath to dry the sweat of the night, get dressed, go out to find a place that\
  \ would sell breakfast, buy ingredients for lunch and dinner that did not have to\
  \ cool, cook, play dominoes, sweating, listening to the noise of the city, going\
  \ to sleep with the sun, and the same the next day, the week that followed and so\
  \ for several more months (I will not say the exact number of months to not cry\
  \ as I write the history). After three weeks amid uncertainty, the opportunity to\
  \ travel to the States was presented, and everything returned to its usual chaos.\
  \ That routine was the main purpose for which I traveled to Atlanta, Georgia: the\
  \ uncertainty of what was to become of Puerto Rico. One of the things that you learn\
  \ when you must emigrate unexpectedly is about the little preparation that human\
  \ beings have with unexpected movements, with transitions, with natural disasters.\n\
  I arrived in Atlanta at nine o'clock at night and I think I just wanted to sleep\
  \ in a place where there was air conditioning and to drink a glass of cold water.\
  \ I remember that the first thing I had for breakfast was the traditional peanut\
  \ butter and jelly sandwich, which I had never had the opportunity to try. The necessity\
  \ that Puerto Rico was going through became an experience to develop a guilty pleasure\
  \ that I would incorporate into my normal diet without realizing it and that would\
  \ accompany me on several trips. The best ideas that have come to me have been with\
  \ a sandwich of these in my hand. The crazy ideas, the wild famines, the \u201C\
  I do not know what to eat\u201D, have been starring by that sandwich. Better ideas,\
  \ for example, when I returned to Puerto Rico from Atlanta, I decided to apply for\
  \ a master's degree in Madrid, Spain. This is how one year after Hurricane Mar\xED\
  a I arrived in Spain to continue my graduate studies, and the last thing my mother\
  \ made me to eat was a PBandJ sandwich as if she were an accomplice of my guilty\
  \ pleasure,\nMaybe it's a way to hold on to that stage of my life where I was very\
  \ afraid. Or it is also a way to go home. In my case, I carry with me the trauma\
  \ of going hungry, or the sweet moment of that first bite of PBandJ sandwich that\
  \ afternoon in Atlanta so far from Puerto Rico. Going around the world with grabbing\
  \ something in your hands is a metaphor for things you do not want to let go or\
  \ let go we are all spinning the world with memories, traumas, emotions, in hand.\
  \ The PBandJ brings me closer to the piece of island that I know as my home. Perhaps\
  \ this story always about the ways of going back home that one finds through the\
  \ experiences - or the trips when someone goes around the world with a PBandJ sandwich\
  \ in the hand."
