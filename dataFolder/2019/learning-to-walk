Text: "Her face was a map of wrinkles. A spiralling stream and deep gullied canyon\
  \ spreading from the corners of her eyes and along the ridges of her forehead. When\
  \ she laughed, as she often did, she would squint, her dark brown eyes closing and\
  \ gap-toothed smile emerging from pruned lips as her body seemed to shake right\
  \ down to the bone. She sat at 5\u201D2 in a red deck chair, the oversized seat\
  \ dwarfing her as the tips of her feet, just barely scraping the ground, swayed\
  \ in turn. Se\xF1ora Echavarr\xEDa was seventy-five years old and had lived here\
  \ all her life, or so I would come to know. \n\nIt was my first week in Medell\xED\
  n. I was feeling pretty lonely; I didn\u2019t know anyone on this continent, let\
  \ alone in this city. Each morning I would leave my apartment, get into the rickety\
  \ elevator where the lights didn\u2019t work and plummet (a little too fast for\
  \ my liking) fifteen floors to the ground, waving to the security guard as I left\
  \ for a morning class of Spanish.\n\nHer house was on the street next to mine. The\
  \ bakery opposite wafting the scent of just-baked pan de coco as I passed each day.\
  \ Trees leaned over the pavement and the sagging branches and steady breeze meant\
  \ there were always little piles of leaves building up in the gutters. The houses\
  \ stood in alternating orange and yellow, stark against the luscious green hills.\
  \ Every few minutes a motorbike would charge down the street, sending little puffs\
  \ of smoke in backfire as they knocked up the leaves.\n\nIt was 8:55AM, my classes\
  \ started at 9. I rounded the corner at a half jog half walk and began down the\
  \ street. I was passing a parked car more rust than machine when she called out:\n\
  \n\u2018Joven! Young man, come over!\u2019 \nI hesitated, giving a quick glance\
  \ down at my watch before crossing over to her side of the road. I\u2019d seen her\
  \ three or four times before, her gaze following me along the street. I would walk.\
  \ She would watch. \n\u2018Why are you always rushing?\u2019 She questioned immediately,\
  \ before I could say anything.\nI stuttered to explain myself but stopped, something\
  \ telling me she didn\u2019t really want to know my answer anyway. Smiling, she\
  \ beckoned to an empty chair tucked just inside the door. \u2018Why don\u2019t you\
  \ sit awhile and let things catch up with themselves for a change?\u2019 \n\nI didn\u2019\
  t really know what she meant, and I think that\u2019s why I decided to stay, pulling\
  \ up the matching red deck chair as any idea of making my class faded away. \n\n\
  Her age was one of the first things she told me, seventy-five. She was proud of\
  \ it, almost like each year was something she had gone out and collected herself.\
  \ She had been in this neighbourhood since she was a girl, the house passed down\
  \ from her grandmother, to her mother and now to her. We sat together for awhile,\
  \ the faint hum of traffic humming in the distance. She would point things out while\
  \ she talked: the birds that fluttered in and out of the trees, little green and\
  \ blue flowers painted along the brickwork on her house, a mural that I\u2019d never\
  \ noticed before. She liked to share, with her stories meandering through the morning\
  \ and crossing borders into her life and the lives of those she had known. When\
  \ her stories reached the era of Pablo Escobar a fleeting sadness crossed her eyes.\
  \ I began to wonder who used to sit where I was sat now, and why one lady lived\
  \ in such a big house.\n\n\u2018This is my home, joven,\u2019 she mocked when I\
  \ asked her why she never left, \u2018this street is as much a part of me as I am\
  \ of it,\u2019 giving a fond wave as a man on a motorbike drove past, calling out\
  \ something I couldn\u2019t understand.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I stayed while\
  \ she told stories, but soon enough I could hear the chimes of the church faintly\
  \ in the background. I had long missed my class. Somehow it didn\u2019t seem to\
  \ matter that much."
