Text: "I almost flipped through pages to find her address.My hands shivered and my\
  \ body furiously wobbled while going through the careworn pocket diary. Adrenaline\
  \ rushing through my body, my tongue quivering while taking that single name. RHEA.\
  \ No, it cannot be her. It was not possible for a dead carcass to move around. \"\
  Rhea is no more! She died 3 months ago.\" I repeated in my mind like an orison to\
  \ calm my fears. Hunting through pages, I found a black blotted paper with a penmanship\
  \ not unknown, scribbled with an uneven vigour- \n Bibanwa Road, K-no.-229-1, Rajasthan.\
  \ Impulses ran through my body like electric shocks. Never thought my first trip\
  \ to Rajasthan could be this horrifying. \n.\n.\nI had to find Rhea in the place\
  \ where she spent her last days- Rajasthan...\"her hometown\". In past days of my\
  \ trip, I'd seen Rhea many a times trying to tell me something or rather haunt me....or\
  \ better- leaving me in a horrified perplexed state!\n.\n.\nStanding in front of\
  \ a big deserted chateau kind house with exceptionally large lychgate, not different\
  \ from typical Rajasthani architecture; chillies basking in golden sun on balmy\
  \ days of late summer, eerie bustle in the atmosphere which was too obnoxious for\
  \ a house who was still morning over a loss of a member, holes on the walls with\
  \ cobwebs in them, climber plants grew up the house winding around drain pipes-\
  \ all adding to the spookiness of the place. For a moment my heart sinked and I\
  \ wanted to run away from there but on another note, I could feel Rhea's presence,\
  \ forcing me to go in! Pushing the heavy gates open, the touch of the iron bars\
  \ seized my hands with cold. There was unevenness in the surroundings with a deafening\
  \ silence , in contrast to the crunching of the old dead leaves as I walked over\
  \ them.\n.\n.\nKnocking at the door, I felt awkward as well as numb. An old woman\
  \ wearing a \"Laharia\" printed Ghaghra and Kanchli with an odhni as a veil opened\
  \ the door. She had deep feeling less eyes with face full of warts and blackheads,\
  \ chewing betel nut with added more arrogance to her already \"arrogant face\".\n\
  \"Namastey!\" I said to break ice between two unknown souls. \"Is this Rhea Rana's\
  \ place? I'm her friend from England!\" \nThe woman glanced me with an outcasted\
  \ look. \"No...no!! There's no Rhea in there! Get away...\" She spoke in pure Rajasthani\
  \ and slammed the door on my face!\n.\n.\nI could sense something wrong.The woman\
  \ was hiding something and I had to know about it! \nI waited for 3 hours outside\
  \ that house, just to slip in at the right moment! Suddenly the grand gate opened\
  \ and a Range Rover moved out; that's when I slipped in....\n.\nAs I walked across\
  \ the gloomy room, I could see old portraits and paintings of old Rajputana rulers,\
  \ cobwebs on the corner,  flickering lamps, ripped old golden curtains, dust on\
  \ royal furniture, huge dust covered chandeliers which were creating an ambience\
  \ of a haunted house! The house was filled with smell of pipe or cigarette smoke.\
  \ Dust floating in the air was costing on my tongue and my heart pounded with fear....But\
  \ it didn't sway my determination.\n.\n.\nI racked the house and couldn't find a\
  \ single thing related to Rhea! It was like as if her whole life and existence was\
  \ erased! I knew that Rhea wasn't lieing but there was no time for me to find the\
  \ truth!\nI left for England next day with cradle full of experiences...No one imagined\
  \ that Rhea could be the part of my Travel Story! Instead of writing about my visit\
  \ to Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Mehrangarh Fort, Udaipur, etcetera, I wrote about the \"\
  encounter with my ghost pal\". Whenever I visit Rajasthan again, I would never forget\
  \ about Rhea's story which still gives me goosebumps!"
