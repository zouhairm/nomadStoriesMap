Text: "This is not a love-at-first-sight story but, I guarantee you, it\u2019s a heartfelt\
  \ and passionate one. It starts with a disenchanted young girl and a marvellous\
  \ city in the South of Spain: the girl is, obviously, me and the city is Granada.\
  \ \n\nI had been there for less than a month when one day I was feeling sad and\
  \ bored; the bullring was as blood-curdling as I imagined it to be, the Arabic castle\
  \ was way too far for me to possibly reach it, the cold mountains made me curse\
  \ the day I decided to pass an entire academic semester in that city. That millennial\
  \ homesickness was slowly killing me, so I decided to risk it all and pass my afternoon\
  \ in the gipsy hood of Sacromonte. \nIn those tight Oriental-looking streets I met\
  \ a fortune-teller who, after a long conversation about life, told me I was being\
  \ negative. He suggested that my problem was seeing things for what they appeared\
  \ and not for what they truly are: \u201CVisiting a country means changing the way\
  \ you look at others and embracing the possibility of being changed by them\u201D\
  . That chat was life-changing. I eventually understood I was frozen by fear, and\
  \ that, my friends, is the worst feeling a traveller can experience!\n\nOnce I finally\
  \ opened my eyes, Granada revealed itself as the enchanted and ravishing city I\u2019\
  ve read about in so many poems; the Plaza de Toros became a medieval arena where\
  \ bullfighters constantly tried to impress young ladies; the Alhambra became a fancy\
  \ Arabic kingdom where political and romantic intrigues were commonplace and where\
  \ Oriental and European flavours peacefully met; the Sierra Nevada provided the\
  \ snow for the magical creatures that lived there\u2026 Among those different worlds,\
  \ gipsies would laugh and dance every night, and they would put spells on the city\
  \ just to protect its starry sky and its moonlit atmosphere for the centuries ahead.\
  \ God knows how thankful I am for those spells! \nThere\u2019s a Spanish saying\
  \ which goes something like this: \u201CThere is nothing worst in life than being\
  \ blind in Granada\u201D. I get it now."
