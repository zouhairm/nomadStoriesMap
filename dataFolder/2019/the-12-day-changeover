Text: "We travel by battered boat, seaweed-stained, but its tiller still works, its\
  \ radio, its hand-cranked orange juicer. A fresh coat of pistachio. There is a crew\
  \ of three: a captain, a navigator, a cook. One of them is a ghost; they know one\
  \ of them is a ghost, hear the rattling chains every night, but the other two haven't\
  \ figured out which of them it is. At every meal, at every anchor, every time they\
  \ spy another ship on the river or a bird of paradise on the shore, two are thinking:\
  \ Are you a ghost are you a ghost are you a ghost are you a ghost? The third, the\
  \ ghost, is not thinking anything. The ghost is the perfect imitation of a human\
  \ afloat on the water, travelling somewhere. Ghost sups with the humans, plays cards,\
  \ talks dreamily about family back home, their distant destination. When they go\
  \ to sleep ghost lifts the phantom chains, rattles them, stalks the deck. Ghost\
  \ feels lucky to be here, where it is humid and noisy, where the air smells of campfire.\
  \ The insects are chittering. The birds call. Around dawn, the three will sit up\
  \ in their cots and stare across the room at each other and wonder.\n\nWe hunt small\
  \ rainbows: the lit-up sunset, pollinating bee, ravens on the rooftops. Finding\
  \ the pace, it may be slow, of getting through and moving on. Supporting what makes\
  \ life shine. Laughter, song. Walking at night. Walking at day. The warming sun\
  \ in winter. The moon, emptying and filling like a well. The distant stars. The\
  \ ragged cloth. These technologies will not steer you wrong as you travel through\
  \ your years.\n\nRainbows put a silver-screen sheen on you, the streets, your human\
  \ heart. A whole sky gone backdrop, a whole city gone set. Dashing like a dancer,\
  \ feeling beer-bittersweet; the taste of black liquorice on your tongue. Oh, those\
  \ silver pinprick stars. Oh, those rainbow oilspots and ruby flashing lights. What\
  \ a night, what a day, what a loop-the-loop of sound & vision. Running under lampposts\
  \ like you can outrun your scampering shadow; dart this way, that, and maybe you'll\
  \ finally lose that midnight thing, be rid of it and loose.\n\nStarshine getting\
  \ weaker by the minute; squint squint fire up the spotlights, turn them off, anything\
  \ to change the fade. Venus rising, mercury twinkle, flashlights off snow. Sunglasses,\
  \ let your eyes adjust. Have the patience of the international date line. You will\
  \ not be harried. You will not be hurried. Close your eyes and extend your hand\
  \ to the heavens and hope the stars'll flare up, brighter bright, then come and\
  \ take your hand, to dance. Or else go inside: screw it, what does the calendar\
  \ know anyway. All of us are cozy in the darkened den, one panorama after another,\
  \ lit up from the carousel. \n\nThe tide brings in different things. Backpacks,\
  \ dive-marker-bouys, driftwood. Another day it's slippas & turtleshell. A morning\
  \ after a thunderstorm there are jellyfish, millions of them, gleaming in the sand\
  \ like rubies. The tide brings sandpipers - planing, & whales - loping. It brings\
  \ dear friends in ships, with wide white sails. It brings salt. It leaves that salt\
  \ on your skin.The tide brings something sharper than lulling warmth: something\
  \ that will cut through the blood and muscle and sinew of you to leave that silver\
  \ in your heart. That silver & that 24 karat gold. There are different ways to heat\
  \ your body, tactics sneaky and subtle. Quick, wiki wiki, aSAP; Feel the trades\
  \ change with your pinky finger held up to the moon. The right kind of tide makes\
  \ it feel more sun than sunny. Sun that will not just to tide you over; sustained\
  \ warmth to ride out all the changing tides."
