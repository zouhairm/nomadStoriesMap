Text: "It was pouring rain as the boy was pushing the bike through the muddy paths\
  \ that led to his rural village in the outskirts of Luang Prabang. His sister went\
  \ ahead, smiling and chanting. She waited for us at the entrance of the small house.\
  \ There she was, soaking wet, informing her parents that they had brought a visitor.\
  \ \n \nI got to the steps of the small gray concrete house, no doors to separate\
  \ those two empty  rooms. Girl took my hand and guided me inside, Father and Mother\
  \ were surprised by my presence, yet brought a wooden chair an invited me to sit\
  \ down.  \n \nWords aside, just gestures and signs to communicate between two distant\
  \ cultures.   I sat with my camera, the same camera that had caught the attention\
  \ of the kids while I was watching them play in the small river cascades under the\
  \ rain just two hours before.  They jumped in and out the water, splashing and laughing.\
  \ Time stopped while water poured savagely and the kids played.\n \nThey were shy\
  \ at first, but soon began posing in front the camera lens.  Girl made an effort\
  \ to answer some of my questions in a broken English - river, school, village. \
  \ Boy was staring at the rented bicycle; he was waiting for permission to ride it.\
  \ I nodded. Sister stayed still, staring at her brother as he went back and forth\
  \ down the stone pavement.  Boy came back, parked the bike and talked with Girl.\
  \  They invited me to follow them, I had no idea where we were going.    As I reached\
  \ out for the bike, Boy smiled and took it from me: he would carry it. \n \nWe crossed\
  \ the thin stream of water that border the graveled road, and walked into a path\
  \ surrounded by dense vegetation. Girl led the way, while Boy pushed and pushed\
  \ the bike. The mud and dirt were getting inside the tires and brakes. A few hundred\
  \ metres away the small village appeared. Cows grazing, pigs splashing, and chickens\
  \ eating what they could find.\n \nI offered a smoke to Father, who accepted and\
  \ offered me one of his own. Mother put the kettle on the burning flame to heat\
  \ some water.  I showed him pictures of his children, playing in nature. His toothless\
  \ mouth smiled, the kids laughed and Mother looked happy.\n \nArgentina, I said,\
  \ and wrote it with the white chalk over the blackboard that hanged in the room;\
  \ during the day it was school, at night it became home.  I drew a big map marking\
  \ my origin, and another big dot of their country, Laos.\n \nThe water boiled and\
  \ Mother poured tea. They sat and watched me taking pictures, we smoked some more\
  \ and I thanked them for their hospitality.  As I was crossing the threshold on\
  \ my way out, I found Boy washing the bike, struggling with the mud, getting it\
  \ ready so I could go back to where I had to go.  \n \nAs I rode back to the hostel\
  \ in town, I couldn't help feeling moved by the innocence and care of the family.\
  \  Sitting in the balcony that looked over the Mekong River, I watched the rain\
  \ pouring down, and I remember smoking bitterly,  overwhelmed by the certainty that\
  \ nothing but flagrant inequalities reign our societies. And yet, as I scrolled\
  \ through the pictures in my camera, the smiles on Boy and Girl\u2019s faces did\
  \ not show any deprivation nor envy, just sheer joy and happiness."
