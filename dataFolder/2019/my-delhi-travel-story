Text: "A couple of year ago me and my friend Mr. Karwan who\u2019s from Kurdish region\
  \ of Iraq decided to visit New Delhi from Haydarabad, India. \nAt 16th of April\
  \ year 2016, we travelled to New Delhi. My friend was very excited because it was\
  \ his first time visiting a foreign country. I wasn`t so excited because I use to\
  \ travel a lot. So we went to Paharganj which is located in New Delhi capital of\
  \ India. \nOnce we arrived, we went to a local fast food restaurant and ordered\
  \ something to fill ourselves up. After that we went to a local store and got some\
  \ needed staffs. Once we had done that we just walked around and enjoyed the magnificent\
  \ country.\nThe first day was very nice. We ate at the Pani Puri (Indian Local Food)\
  \ and it was quite delicious, as it was our first day and we were very tired of\
  \ our trip, so we went to sleep early that we could be cheerful for the next day\
  \ along with our next programs. \nOur hotel was locating in Main Bazar of Paharganj\
  \ which is the great place for foreigners. The weather was getting hot day by day.\
  \ Accommodation, environment and overall all settings were quite peaceful. \nAs\
  \ we were foreigners and both of us especially my friend was not familiar with Indian\
  \ spicy food, so we were used to go Lajpat Nagar by Metro which is almost 15 Kilometers\
  \ far from Paharganj, where we could find Afghani food which is same like Kurdish\
  \ food. \nNext day we went to visit one the worlds heritage center. Taj Mahal. This\
  \ unique architecture is located in a Forest Colony of Tajganj, Agra, Uttar Pradesh,\
  \ as it is one of the world heritage center, it has thousands of visitors each day.\
  \ \nThe Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna\
  \ river. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, to house\
  \ the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan,\
  \ the builder. After visiting Taj Mahal.\nThe next day we decided to take a local\
  \ sightseeing trip of New Delhi, we took a package along with a guide and we visited\
  \ Lotus Temple, Qutub Minar, Humayuns Tomb, India Gate, Red fort, Jama Masjid and\
  \ many more historical places. \nWe allocate a day for shopping also and we went\
  \ to City Walk, DLF Emporia and The Chanakya Mall and we shopped our favorite T-Shirts\
  \ and Jeans. \nA number of days which we were in Paharganj, we had a lots of unforgettable\
  \ memories, it was a fun journey and I\u2019d defiantly recommend my friends visiting\
  \ at least once, because it was one the best trips I\xB4ve ever taken I hope that\
  \ one day in your lifetime you will get the chance to go to there."
