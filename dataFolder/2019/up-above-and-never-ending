Text: "\u201CPlease be careful when you\u2019re taking pictures or recording,\u201D\
  \ the Park Ranger warns in a monotone voice. \u201CIf your phone falls in any of\
  \ the cracks, we won\u2019t fish it out for you.\u201D\nHis glove pointed next to\
  \ his iron cleats, where there was a fine but long crack on the ice, almost like\
  \ a gigantic scratch. The deeper it went, the darker the blue tints would get. And\
  \ in one side, small as a frozen beetle, you could see a black spot: a trapped phone.\
  \ \n\u201CIt must be a bummer to lose your phone here,\u201D one of the hikers murmured.\n\
  \u201CWe don\u2019t care if you lose your stuff,\u201D the instructor replied without\
  \ hesitation. \u201CWe care about the glacier. Phones\u2019 batteries take hundreds\
  \ of years to decompose.\u201D\nNone of the tourists lost their phone on that particular\
  \ hike. Only one of them was too busy vlogging to notice his step and almost slipping\
  \ into one of the mini lagoons. Almost. He just laughed it off and put his selfie\
  \ stick away for a while. I don\u2019t blame him, because walking up here is hard.\
  \ Up here, on the Perito Moreno glacier, I am forced to walk the same way astronauts\
  \ do: with slow, exaggerated, calculated steps to prevent me from falling. Surprisingly,\
  \ it doesn\u2019t take much training to climb up. You only need standard winter\
  \ gear, gloves, special crampons and lots of attention.\nIt\u2019s easy to lose\
  \ the horizon line between the cloudy sky with weak sunshine bumping against the\
  \ chain of low mountains with sharp peaks. Below, a steady river is making its way\
  \ through the ice.  I\u2019m told the water is so pure I can drink from it if I\
  \ want, or fill up a bottle for the rest of the trip. We have a long way to go and,\
  \ forward, I see nothing but bumpy, never-ending white ground. No matter where I\
  \ look, everything is frozen. Every cave, crack and bridge is so immaculate that\
  \ it glitters. And the quiet is menacing. I\u2019m sure the only sound out here\
  \ is my disrupted breath and heartbeat. Except for the moment everyone stands still\
  \ because, in the distance, there\u2019s that weirdly familiar sound of land violently\
  \ cut open. It\u2019s the chunks of ice in the front of the glacier that fall 60\
  \ meters into the Lago Argentino.\nI\u2019m not used to the cold. In the west of\
  \ Argentina, where I come from, it hasn\u2019t snowed since July 9th, 2007. That\
  \ day marked the end of a 90-year-old streak of a Buenos Aires without snow. I don\u2019\
  t really know how to behave, I don\u2019t know how my eyes have got used to all\
  \ this white in one place. My cheeks are slightly burning from the reflection of\
  \ the sun and I can\u2019t help but wonder what would happen if I took my gloves\
  \ off to feel the icy walls around me. My fingers are so numb I can\u2019t feel\
  \ the burn, but I see it: a mixture of red and purple bruises drowning in the pearly\
  \ graupel.\n\u201CIf I were you, I\u2019d stop doing that,\u201D the Ranger tells\
  \ me with a smile. \u201CPeople can literally freeze to death here, you know\u201D\
  .\nNothing moves for long on a glacier. There aren\u2019t any big birds flying over\
  \ us or eccentric silver furs walking out and about. Nothing survives up there.\
  \ Except for one tiny, black insect nicknamed \u201Cthe Patagonia Dragon\u201D that\
  \ climbs on even the highest spike. That and the hundreds of belongings left forgotten\
  \ inside the blue nooks and crannies."
