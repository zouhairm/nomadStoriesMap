Text: "\u201CWhen I grow up, I will go there and see the stunning beauty of North!,\u201D\
  \ the thirteen years old me.\n\nAt a very young age, I promise to myself to travel\
  \ around the Philippines and the world. I am amazed at what I\u2019ve discovered\
  \ and learned in our History and Social Studies subjects. \n\nOur country is recognized\
  \ as \u201CThe Pearl of the Orient Seas\" because of its natural beauty \u2013 tropical\
  \ country, abundant in natural and marine resources, rich in arts, culture, and\
  \ tradition.\n\nAnd one of the exquisite places to travel is the Ilocos Region,\
  \ located in the northwest coast of Luzon. This province became a travel spot because\
  \ of historic sites, beaches, and glamorous townscape.\n\nVigan City is the best\
  \ example of preserved historic colonial charm especially its unique grid street\
  \ pattern and urban layout that\u2019s why it is listed on the UNESCO (United Nations\
  \ Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage. \n\nNow tell\
  \ me, who are not hooked up to this region?\n\nSo I live the dream! I finally went\
  \ to this fascinating place. Thanks to the travel trend in our country, \u201CJoiner\u2019\
  s Tour.\u201D Every travel agency caters tour on a specific location, time and itinerary\
  \ joined by unknown people which turn into families after the tour. \n\nAfter a\
  \ busy week at work, I and my friends are ready for the weekend getaway! We joined\
  \ the 2 days and 1-night tour for only one-thousand seven-hundred pesos (P1, 700.00)\
  \ or thirty-four dollars ($34) per person. It includes round-trip van service, driver\
  \ & guide fee, fuel, parking and toll fees, almost 30 sites to visit, travel insurance,\
  \ permits, environmental, entrance fees and a lodge stay along the Pagudpud beach\
  \ area.\n\nThe joiner\u2019s tour usually departs every Friday night and back on\
  \ a Sunday night. This is where our journey starts!\n\nFor your information, Ilocos\
  \ is divided into 2 parts \u2013 Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur. Some of the highlights\
  \ are when we tried the extreme 4x4 ride at Paoay Sand Dunes. I\u2019m not into\
  \ rides, but the experience is completely surreal! Burgos Wind Farm and Bangui Wind\
  \ Mills exhibit large turbines that help to produce electricity and distribute to\
  \ the whole province, like wow, that\u2019s how science works!\n\nBacarra Church,\
  \ which became famous and controversial because of its long aisle, so to the future\
  \ bride and groom, if you have doubt in the last minute of your wedding, you know\
  \ where to go, kidding! Anticipated, the fourth longest bridge in the Philippines\
  \ is also here, Patapat Viaduct is an elevated road over 30 meters above sea level\
  \ and connects to a neighboring province, Cagayan Valley.\n\nAnd of course, the\
  \ much-awaited beaches! Blue Lagoon is also known as \u201CBoracay of the North\u201D\
  \ mesmerize by the color of water and face the South China Sea. You can also enjoy\
  \ the world\u2019s longest zipline! Saud White Beach, enclosed by hills and mountains\
  \ with windmills around. It is picturesque make you feel wait to be with the ocean\
  \ waves again. \n\nYou will also see paradise after the 1.5-kilometer trek and it\u2019\
  s Kaybigan Falls!\n\nHeritage Village and Calle Crisologo show architecture is awesome\
  \ because of multi-cultural influences! You can also roam around by a calesa ride,\
  \ mode of transportation using a horse-drawn calash.\n\nFood is cheap but satisfying!\
  \ Three famous delicacies are bagnet, Vigan longganisa and Ilocos empanada. Bagnet,\
  \ boiled and deep-fried pork is good viad. It is crispy, crunchy and indulgent.\
  \ Vigan longganisa is a sausage delicacy with plenty of garlic and spices in the\
  \ mixture. While Ilocos empanada is a delicious snack! It is a handheld orange pastry\
  \ made with wheat flour stuffed with meat, carrots, corns, cheese, and peppers.\
  \ It is not hard to find because it is noticeable along the streets!\n\nTraveling\
  \ in Ilocos made me realize that it\u2019s just a one step closer to connect and\
  \ know more about my country. It\u2019s just a single ethnic that brings a lot of\
  \ remarkable and astonished assets in the Philippines! That\u2019s why I\u2019m\
  \ grateful and fell in love with this region. Agyamanak (local term for thank you\
  \ in Ilocos), Ilocos Region!"
