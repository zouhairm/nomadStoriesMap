Text: "Why I enjoy making a stopover every time I'm headed south of India to this\
  \ famously dubbed \u201CFrench Riviera of the East\u201D  is because you don't travel\
  \ to Pondicherry and go frantically scouring your travel itinerary for \u201Cplaces\
  \ to see\u201D and \u201Cthings to do\u201D. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are\
  \ places to see and things to do, but it\u2019s more about soaking up its famed\
  \ Indo-French culture.\nFor nearly three centuries before India\u2019s independence,\
  \ Pondicherry passed through the hands of the Dutch, British and French colonists.\
  \ While citizens forego a possibility to remain French in 1954, the union territory\
  \ still retains subtle remnants of the French culture that pervade the small beach\
  \ town popular with western tourists.\nMe and my seasoned travel mate arrive at\
  \ Ville Noir \u2014 the black town part of the city, and move towards the Promenade\
  \ where the city beach is located. The change in urbanscape is stark: brick-lined\
  \ pavements, pastel-shaded colonial styled villas, sunny boutique hotels and guest\
  \ houses, and roads that have still retained their French names. We know now that\
  \ we've arrived in the French Quarters, or Ville Blanche (white town), as they call\
  \ it.\nThe harmony with which the two cultures have merged since its colonial past\
  \ begins to rub on us as we move from the Joseph-Fran\xE7ois Dupleix floor (opening\
  \ onto the calm, unadulterated view of the sea) to the Mohandas Gandhi Quarters\
  \ (with its own private library stocked with books on philosophy, new-age lit, art\
  \ and a large dose of Vogue magazine!)\nIt\u2019s a hot and humid sunny day, so\
  \ we grab a bike, map and sunglasses, and leave to navigate the glories of the colonial\
  \ past as the French war memorial, Gandhi and Fran\xE7ois Dupleix statues erected\
  \ around the Promenade pass us by.\nA sense of calm pervades the air as we push\
  \ through the silent streets with just the right amount of tourist smattering and\
  \ locals to see the Sri Aurobindo ashram.\nA visit to the Pondicherry Museum proves\
  \ the city\u2019s spectacular past: Carriages and rare Victorian furniture from\
  \ the 18th century belonging to princes, governors and generals; and other rarities\
  \ found at archaeological digs in Arikamedu. The highlight of the day remained \u201C\
  Danae\u201D\u2014 a sensuous painting by Italian artist Antonio Corregio.\nAt the\
  \ French Institute of Pondicherry (which is usually closed to the public), we counted\
  \ our lucky stars to have been taken on by a bored but thankfully enthusiastic researcher\
  \ who allowed us to see (and touch!) a 16th-century palm leaf manuscript. The institute\
  \ is home to some rare palm leaf manuscripts dating back to as early as the 14th\
  \ century and it carries out research missions in Indology, ecology and social sciences.\n\
  Alliance Fran\xE7aise \u2014 the French cultural center, usually conducts art workshops,\
  \ film screenings and plays on most evenings. We were lucky to view some spectacular\
  \ Cannes film festival French movie screenings of this year: Poupoupidou and Delicatessen.\
  \ The place is great to meet and network with other tourists and like-minded wanderers\
  \ of the artistic kind.\nNirvana, a boutique store nearby, stocks some amazing kitsch\
  \ and pop art collectible items, clothes and accessories by local designers that\
  \ are worth a buy. I was especially impressed with an old rice sack from a company\
  \ in the early 90s turned into a hot sling bag.\nA trip to Pondicherry without visiting\
  \ Auroville \u2014 an international township endorsed by UNESCO and also called\
  \ \u201CThe city of dawn\u201D \u2014 is a mistake.\nAuroville is home to some of\
  \ the best virgin beaches, cafes, galleries and hippies backpacking from Israel\
  \ and Europe.\nIts main attraction is the Matri Mandir, an astounding golden dome\
  \ meditation temple with the world\u2019s optically perfect crystal globe at its\
  \ center. The structure is located in a beautiful area called Peace that has around\
  \ 12 gardens in over 22 acres of land, attracting thousands of yogis every year.\n\
  And this is why visiting Pondicherry should be in your top \u201Cplaces to see\u201D\
  . You owe it to yourself: to experience peace and a harmonious co-existence of cultures."
