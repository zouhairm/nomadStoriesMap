Text: "I had it. \nOn one end I had a loving girlfriend, a secure job with a steady\
  \ paycheck, and great friends that I hung out with regularly.\nOn the other end\
  \ I had a smothering needy girlfriend, a dead-end job that was boring as hell, and\
  \ a group of friends that did the same thing every evening and weekend. \nI should\
  \ have been grateful for what I had but I felt stuck and uninspired. I was lucky\
  \ enough to win a trip to Egypt and even have the ability to take time off of work\
  \ and save for expenditures. Never in my life have I felt such a spike in excitement\
  \ and giddiness that lasted for more than 10 minutes! I told everyone. I was on\
  \ top of the world! I bragged and gloated about how 'I WAS THE MAN' and how I deserved\
  \ this - just for winning this trip and being able to go. I told everyone that I\
  \ even opted and paid for all the available excursions, 'cus, you know, I was the\
  \ man. I was ON it. \nEvery day of the trip I was walking around with my chest puffed\
  \ like I was supposed to be there. I kept telling myself, \"I'm in fucking EGYPT!\"\
  \n\nThree days in and I had to wake up extra early to catch a ride on a sunrise\
  \ hot air balloon ride over Luxor. There was a bombshell redheaded Aussie that I've\
  \ been flirting with in the typical American Bravado kind of way. I played it 'mostly'\
  \ cool until the balloon actually left the ground. It was then when she called me\
  \ out almost immediately, \"Not so fond of heights eh? We've barely lifted off!\"\
  \n\nPlay it cool man, play it cool. \n\nNervous anxiety and excitement consumed\
  \ me. The city shrunk below us in a slow-mo fashion. We saw temples, the Nile, inside\
  \ the tops of homes; we even hit a tree!\nAfter we landed mostly unscathed, I was\
  \ ecstatic! So high on life. \nOn the bus trip back to the others we were given\
  \ a breakfast platter in a styrofoam to-go box. I was too amped to even eat. Did\
  \ that REALLY just happen? I had a slight shake to me. Nerves? Adrenaline? Hunger?\
  \ Not to mention it looked like a crummy sandwich on white bread, an apple, and\
  \ a couple of celery sticks. What kind of lame breakfast was this? \n\nPer usual\
  \ we got to our stop and a mob of people swarmed around the bus doors eager to see\
  \ us. It made me feel like a rockstar! Yes! I am an American, I am awesome! Although\
  \ this time was different. \n\nNo sooner than I stepped off the bus to greet the\
  \ people, a small group of kids grabbed my styrofoam breakfast box and ran off.\
  \ \n\"Hey! Shit!\" They were off. Weaving through the people and disappearing in\
  \ the crowd. \n\"They stole my breakfast\" I look around. \n\"Hey, Hello? Did you\
  \ see that?\" No one seemed to care. \n\nMy stomach growled and I instinctively\
  \ grabbed my belly; my plump, no-ribs-showing-through-my-shirt belly. \n\nI just\
  \ stood there in a stupor as the crowd dissipated and I sunk into myself. They weren't\
  \ crowding the bus to greet us, they were there to sell us trinkets, trade their\
  \ camels for wives... beg. Yeah, I was hungry but I JUST went on an incredible hot\
  \ air balloon ride in EGYPT - a trip that I WON. A trip that I searched for because\
  \ I wasn't content with what I ALREADY HAVE. \n\nI've got cash. I can get food no\
  \ problem. \nI'm fine. \n\nThey were shirtless, shoeless and, if I were good at\
  \ math, I could count their ribs. It was at that moment the world expanded outside\
  \ of myself. \n\nI didn't eat or speak the rest of the day."
