Text: "My boyfriend and I went for the first time to Africa.\nWhat did we expect?\
  \ Nothing, and I mean nothing in a good way, why, nothing? Because we wanted to\
  \ be surprised, to feel different and to learn a different kind of life.\nWhen we\
  \ got there we were already impressed with the Marrakech airport, so... Everything\
  \ went well so far.\nThen we got to our hotel, near to the main market, we obviously\
  \ went for a walk, it was somehow very similar to what we have back home but obviously\
  \ not in the same way. There were all kinds of handmade products, from shoes to\
  \ magnets, but what we liked the most were some kind of old houses that gave, I\
  \ would say, the unique Moroccan architecture.\n\nWhat I am about to describe is\
  \ a bad experience we had back there, BUT... Please be aware that this kind of things\
  \ can happen ANYWHERE, this is something to share in order so other people can be\
  \ prepared, but it doesn't involve the whole Moroccan culture.\n\nSo... We were\
  \ there, just walking around the market and we got lost, something I may say is\
  \ quite easy since the houses look pretty much the same. Short long story, we got\
  \ lost and someone offered some help so we took it but we ended up paying 30\u20AC\
  \ for his help. As I said, this is only a bad experience we had, but it doesn't\
  \ involve the whole Moroccan people, this could have happened ANYWHERE. Just wanted\
  \ to share so people can be prepared.\n\nAnyway, the next days we had a trip to\
  \ the dessert which by the way is not a near as we thought it would be, but it was\
  \ totally worth it, the travel agency gave us the opportunity to immerse in the\
  \ Moroccan culture every time it was possible, by eating typical Moroccan food,\
  \ smoking Shisha, Henna Tattoos, and explaining some of the intangible factors of\
  \ the culture such as how do they live, how does marriage work, the languages they\
  \ speak, the ethnicity, the clothes they wear and the role of the male and female\
  \ in society.\n\nOn our last day we got to know another side of the city, which\
  \ was more \"Occidental\" I would say, why? Beacuse, you can find all kind of fancy\
  \ international stores and restaurants as well as McDonald's and Subway. From my\
  \ point of view, even though we had a bad experience on the Moroccan markets, I\
  \ think this is the best place to get to know the real culture and the real people\
  \ on this city.\n\nSo, last but not least, some tips:\n- It's a hot city, so...\
  \ Bring a lot of sunscreen\n- Clothes? You can wear whatever you want I guess, but\
  \ please have in mind that it's a country with some traditions that would be nice\
  \ to respect.\n- Try to exchange your money in you hotel or airport, it's safe and\
  \ you won't have to walk around the city looking for a place to do it.\n- Try to\
  \ exchange the amount of money you will spend, that way you won't have money left\
  \ that maybe in you're country would be harder to exchange.\n- BE CAREFUL, try to\
  \ find a point of reference before you go into the market. If you do get lost, try\
  \ to ask to people who work on the market rather than people just walking on the\
  \ street, you will know you're lost if you feel like the only foreign on the street.\n\
  \nAnd finally, be open minded, we live in a world full of differences, there's no\
  \ NORMAL way of living life, there are just different ways to do it. Don't judge\
  \ and do not compare where you are to where you live, that way it would be easier\
  \ for you to enjoy the trip."
