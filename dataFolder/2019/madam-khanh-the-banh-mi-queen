Text: "Every city has its tales of legends and heroes. Those who are talked of in\
  \ hushed tones with religious reverence. I hadn\u2019t been in Hoi An long before\
  \ I heard a name repeatedly whispered in the esteem of a deity: Madam Khahn, The\
  \ Bahn Mi Queen. \n\nRumours swirled and stories were told of a little stall just\
  \ outside of Hoi An\u2019s old town, tucked away in a corner behind a corner behind\
  \ a corner that for 32 years, from 7am to 7pm, has served more than 200 sandwiches\
  \ every day, the first the same as the last: p\xE2t\xE9, pork char siu, sausage,\
  \ fried egg, homemade pickles, papaya, carrots, parsley, chilli sauce, soy sauce,\
  \ and the magic ingredient, Madam Khanh\u2019s secret sauce. All served in a hot\
  \ fresh, crusty on the outside, soft on the inside French roll.\n\n\u201CShe\u2019\
  s not easy to find\u201D people told me, her exact location shared between those\
  \ deemed worthy. \u201CBut be careful\u201D they warned. \u201CMadam Khanh serves\
  \ one thing and one thing only. Don\u2019t try to order anything else. Be polite,\
  \ be respectful, if you offend her, she won\u2019t serve you.\u201D\nDiligently\
  \ following the directions scribbled onto a napkin by a German backpacker the night\
  \ before, I rounded the final corner and saw it, a small stand with an awning above\
  \ that proudly read \u201CMADAM KHANH THE BANH MI QUEEN.\u201D  \n\nThere she was.\
  \ A tiny women with a pink scarf tying up her long white hair, sitting behind the\
  \ stand, rubbing her hands to stay warm. She looked up at me as I took a step forward.\
  \ \u201CMadam Khanh?\u201D I asked. She looked me up and down. \u201CYou. Sit.\u201D\
  \ She nodded towards the little table and chairs inside. \nAnother woman came up\
  \ to me as I started to say \u201CI\u2019d like to try the-\u201D but she cut me\
  \ off. \u201CBAHN MI\u201D she shouted out at Madam Khan who shouted something back,\
  \ already working her magic in her little kitchen moving between the toppings, heating\
  \ the french roll in a makeshift oven and cooking eggs on a single burner stove.\
  \ I look around the little room. The walls are adorned with photos of herself serving\
  \ the people and visitors of Hoi An. There are letters plastered like wall paper\
  \ from tourists who have written to her to thank her for her sandwiches. \n\nStreet\
  \ food runs in Madam Khan\u2019s blood. At 20 years old, she got her first job selling\
  \ sweet bean soup, during the American war, she was restricted to selling from home,\
  \ though the conflict steered relatively clear of Hoi An. After the war, she carried\
  \ her soup around then streets on a bamboo stick with baskets on either side, selling\
  \ to passers by. And finally, in 1985 she settled at her house and started her b\xE1\
  nh m\xEC business.\n\nAs I waited for my breakfast, I watched her work. Madam Kahn\
  \ nodded at scooters buzzing by on the street, locals came by for their regular\
  \ order, she knew what everyone wanted before they ordered it and sandwich after\
  \ sandwich was handed out as customers came and went. \nAnd then it arrived. A fresh\
  \ Bahn Mi was delivered to my table and while Madam Khahn remained busy at the front,\
  \ I caught her watching me out of the corner of her eye. \n\nI took a bite. Sweet,\
  \ salty, spicy, crunchy and creamy. It was everything they said it would be and\
  \ more. A meal that had been perfected over 30 years and now lived in the memories\
  \ and hearts of those who\u2019s sampled it, as it soon would do mine. I couldn\u2019\
  t hide the pure joy on my face as I took bite after bite and while she remained\
  \ as busy as ever at her cart, I saw a smile of satisfaction creep across Madam\
  \ Khanh\u2019s face as I finished my breakfast. \nI walked out under the awning\
  \ and turned back to catch Madam Khanh\u2019s eye. \u201CThank you\u201D I said\
  \ and nodded towards her. For a minute I thought I\u2019d connected with her, a\
  \ once in a lifetime bond formed over pork char sui. \n\nBut Madam Khahn just grunted\
  \ at me and turned back to her hot plate, rightly focussed on the next order."
