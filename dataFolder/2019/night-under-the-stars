Text: I could feel the heat in the air. Never thought a december can be so hot. That's
  when the driver said "We are here." I had seen desserts only in movies. But they
  were exactly like I had seen them. Sand dunes every where. My throat felt like it
  could use some water. In between those sand dunes some tents were built up. I always
  heard about camping in woods or lakeside but camping in dessert was something new
  for me. The time flew by and the sun started to set. The sky started changing its
  colors like shading on a canvas. The most beautiful sunset I had ever seen. Suddenly
  the cool breeze gave me a sigh of comfort. I could feel the change in temperature.
  It felt like summer was long gone and the winter is coming. And I prepared like
  the westeros by wearing warm clothes. But I didn't expect it to get so cold. I can
  feel goosebumps even under my thermal wears. But the Flames of bonfire made it alright.
  It started getting dark. A pleasant night with bonfire and soft music. That's when
  I saw it, the sky full of stars. Living in a city its a miracle to see even one
  star in the sky. But seeing that sight felt like I have reached the space. That
  was whole new experience for me. I hope I get a new experience like this every single
  day. From making friends, lighting the campfire to listening to new stories, everything
  teaches you something.
