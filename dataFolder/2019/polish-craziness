Text: "\u201CChristina, you are selected to travel to Poland\u201D. With these eight\
  \ words and a huge smile on her face, my high school English professor announced,\
  \ that I was one of the eight students that were selected, to travel to a different\
  \ country, (in my case it was Poland), as part of the Erasmus+ student exchanging\
  \ program. Long story short, that is how the most wonderful, life-changing adventure\
  \ of my life begun.\nMy professor, my classmate and I arrived at Warsaw in the noon\
  \ the weather was charming, while we had just a few hours to explore the city and\
  \ its history. The architecture of the buildings located in the old town was marvelous;\
  \ the fact that the historical center of the city was destroyed, during World War\
  \ II, and rebuilt made the observation of these architectural masterpieces even\
  \ more interesting. We were running out of time in Warsaw, so we got in the bus\
  \ heading to Jedrzejow, the hometown of our host families.\n\nWhile our teachers\
  \ were settling in their hotel room, I was in a car with Iza; my host student. \u0397\
  er mum was driving us to their house. I cannot forget the excitement and agony I\
  \ was feeling at that moment. I was about to meet the family that would host me\
  \ for the week ahead. Finally, we arrived. Our destination was a lovely farmhouse.\
  \ In the yard, one could see an enclosed part with chickens in it, while there was\
  \ a stud as well.\nThe moment I walked into my host family\u2019s house, an old\
  \ woman came towards me, she hugged and kissed me 3 times on the cheeks, just like\
  \ all Polish people do. Iza explained to me she was her grandmother. Later on, I\
  \ met her two sisters, the middle one was 14 while the youngest was 6- and a sweetheart.\
  \ We went to bed early, as we knew that the following week was full of activities.\n\
  The three following days of the week passed by really fast. They consisted of morning\
  \ lessons in Iza\u2019s school and excursions in the evenings. In one of those excursions,\
  \ we visited Krakow, Poland\u2019s second largest city and historical center. Krakow\
  \ was SO beautiful and vibrant. I have visited many European cities, but nothing\
  \ can be compared to it. With its large flea market, the stunning old town and its\
  \ big square, Krakow is definitely a hidden gem. While in there, we had the chance\
  \ to visit the Wavell\u2019s castle, an imposing landmark, as well as an unusual\
  \ chocolate shop: chocolate hearts, statues, even shoes, all of them were handmade\
  \ and for sale.\n\nThe next morning, the sunlight, coming through the shutters,\
  \ woke me up. It was Friday, my last day in the Polish school. Iza was already awake.\
  \ We ate breakfast and headed to the school. It was the last time I would see all\
  \ those wonderful people, Iza\u2019s classmates, and her professors. When the lessons\
  \ were over the Polish professors informed us that they had prepared a surprise\
  \ for us in the evening. We headed home wondering what it could be.\nIn the evening\
  \ we were informed that we would go to a traditional Polish restaurant, but none\
  \ of us could imagine what would happen next. As we entered the restaurant, we noticed\
  \ that the waiters were wearing traditional Polish costumes, while there were some\
  \ extra costumes displayed next to the tables. After the delicious dinner, consisted\
  \ of pierogis, (traditional Polish dumblings), one of the girls took a hat from\
  \ the costumes exhibited, a few minutes later everyone was wearing hats and capes\
  \ while dancing to the rhythm of a traditional Polish song, called \u201CPoloneza\u201D\
  . Our professors were clapping for us while taking pictures. It was truly an unforgettable\
  \ experience.\n\nThe day of separation had come. I had to say goodbye to Poland\
  \ and this wonderful family. This was the worst part of the trip. We were all very\
  \ sad but we promised that we would meet again someday in the future. Iza\u2019\
  s little sister gave me a drawing, one that still hangs in my room\u2019s wall,\
  \ reminding me the moments we lived together in this beautiful, European country.\
  \ Thank you Poland, for everything."
