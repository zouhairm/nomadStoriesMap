Text: "June, 2017\n\nThe waves had been changing from azure with occasional shimmers,\
  \ rays of sunlight reflecting in the moving shades of the Mediterranean, to violet-blue\
  \ to pitch-black with white crowns. Now, in the moonlight they were breaking silver\
  \ at the large stones that edged the thin sand beach to my right and the grey cliffs\
  \ behind me and to the left. \n\nFor the past hours, I had been watching day handing\
  \ over to night, absorbed by sea\u2019s steady rhythms, on the Northeastern tip\
  \ of Aigina, a small island in the Aegean Sea. \n\n***\n\nTen days earlier I had\
  \ arrived on a ferry from Athens. I had flown in from Berlin to attend a summer\
  \ school. On my way from Athens airport to the harbour, which included a stop close\
  \ to the Acropolis where I purchased a straw hat to hide my Northern skin from the\
  \ burning heat, I had emptied three large bottles of water. \nIt was the hottest\
  \ June in a long time, maybe even in the history of the Greek capital.\n\nOn the\
  \ island, I had exchanged urban dust for azure blue, taking dips into the soothing\
  \ sea from the small cliff lined beach at the feet of our hotel, dancing with rays\
  \ of sunlight that sliced the under water world into abstract paintings; shades\
  \ of blue and turquoise. An occasional yacht, visitors from the main land, swaying\
  \ in the sluggish waters around me. \n\nI raised to swim, and I swam before I descended\
  \ into my dreams. A daily routine in-between the desert winds, up to 45 degrees,\
  \ that were hollowing my lungs.\n\n\nNow, the summer school was over and I had been\
  \ on my way to take a ferry back, passing the coastal walk towards the tiny harbour,\
  \ when I stopped at a small cliff lined bay a few hundred metres away from the hotel.\
  \ In the distance, its minimalist, concrete, white body, slightly yellowed over\
  \ the years, on top of sharp grey cliffs, surrounded by more cliffs and pines trees,\
  \ resembled a movie scene. \n\nThe scenery\u2019s deserted harshness reminded me\
  \ of Bergman\u2019s Persona. In it, a troubled woman spends a summer with her caretaker\
  \ on a remote island in the Baltic sea. An absence of voice marks the motion picture.\n\
  \nI had sensed the absence of voice in this space, nested in the lingering humidity\
  \ that had slowed down everything around me during my stay in the hotel. One of\
  \ few, maybe the only one, that was still operating on the Northeastern side of\
  \ the island.\n\n\n***\n\nOn an excursion a few days earlier, I had left the group\
  \ and walked down from the Temple of Aphaea on winded sand paths that turned into\
  \ narrow asphalt roads as I approached the centre of the harbour village, Aigina\
  \ Marina, passing an assemblage of barricaded patios, locked doors, and broken windows.\
  \ \n\nThe sea was opening up in front of me when I climbed through one of them,\
  \ a large shop window to the left on the road, stepping on the dusty grounds of\
  \ emptied space, a ventilator, catatonic, hanging from the ceiling, the door to\
  \ a tiny toilet in the back of the room half open. \n\nOn the other side of the\
  \ road, two old men were sitting on plastic chairs, a bucket between them, waving\
  \ at me when I passed by, holding a sea shell and a knife, carving out her flesh.\
  \ \n\u201CLook!\u201D\nHuge teeth were smiling at me. \n\nDawn was crawling up the\
  \ shore when I approached the end of the steep road where an old man crossed his\
  \ legs on a white plastic garden chair in front of another closed shop, smoking,\
  \ gazing into the night, a motorcycle next to him. \n\nA gathering of silence against\
  \ ocean sounds and clear sky; smoke of melancholies fading into the wide night.\
  \ \n\nLater that evening, I joined a few participants who attempted a party in the\
  \ beach bar of the ghost like village. One that I imagined to belong into Western\
  \ movies. Inviting occasional travellers, deserted, pushing the Frontier, falling\
  \ in. From time to time. Then again, silence. \n\nThey had fallen in, certainly,\
  \ seven years earlier. \n\n***"
