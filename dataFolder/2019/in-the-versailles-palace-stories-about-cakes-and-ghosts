Text: "Have you gone to Versailles? No? You've saved a lot of pain and blisters, but\
  \ let me tell you a little about this place and its splendor - I might make you\
  \ go to the good old France. At first glance this is just a huge palace, built several\
  \ centuries ago by Louis XIV - the Sun King. But when you look for the second time,\
  \ you see the story.\nI started from the palace. There are many things to say about\
  \ it. The question is what can not be said.  It is NOT ordinary. When I came in,\
  \ the glow of gold dazzled me stronger than the sun outside. Its huge dimensions,\
  \ its tall, spacious rooms made me feel small. I saw about a quarter of it, but\
  \ it was enough for me to realize that the French monarchy had no equal.\nI went\
  \ out into the gardens, and once again I was shocked - every little flower, every\
  \ fountain, every stone had its own place. Over 1,000 acres of gardens, and yet\
  \ such an order is put, and my room, which is four squares, is not half so tidy.\n\
  The water in the big channel was relaxed. There were people who were sitting on\
  \ the grass and enjoyed the sun and the view. I closed my eyes and shifted to another\
  \ time. Louis XIV walks calmly, and behind him, a huge crowd. What did he thought?\
  \ He was an ordinary man like us, but I could not imagine it as ordinary. \nFrom\
  \ my place I could see the huge window of the library specially created for the\
  \ son of Louis XIV. The books in it must have been cleaned from moments that are\
  \ not suitable for children, and summaries of difficult passages must have been\
  \ added. And what happened in the end? The library was completed when the son of\
  \ the Sun King was 28 years old, with family and children.\nI walked away and as\
  \ I approached the Little Trianon, I remembered what the tour guide had said about\
  \ this place. The Little Trianon was donated by Louis XVI to Marie Antoinette. It\
  \ was his favorite place, away from the strict French court label and the intrigue\
  \ in the royal palace. Here she could go back to the ordinary, daily routine. I\
  \ understood her completely. They said the queen's ghost was hanging around the\
  \ building, and I could feel her presence. Here things were arranged in her way.\
  \ She put her soul in every single thing.\nI went to the gardens and the only thought\
  \ in my head was, \"How could I forget to buy a cake!\". I should have bought a\
  \ cake in honor of Marie Antoinette. She had said, \"Let them eat cake!\". I imagined\
  \ her. She's in a ball dress, and I'm wearing a T-shirt and shorts. Different in\
  \ appearance but the same in the soul. I wondered what it would be if I was her?\
  \ I laughed aloud. Maybe I would be even more capricious than her, knowing what\
  \ kind of princess I am sometimes. All I knew was that I would never achieve her\
  \ sophisticated coolness. Even on the guillotine, the good manners did not leave\
  \ her and when, she by accident stepped on one man's foot, she apologized to him\
  \ with the words: \"Excuse me, sir, I did not want to do it!\" Has she apologized\
  \ to the man or maybe she had given another excuse? She is not here to answer, but\
  \ the question is in the air.\nI was walking and thinking how maybe her kids were\
  \ playing there, and here, behind that bush, she might have cheated on Louis XVI.\
  \ It is no secret to anyone that she has done some mischief behind her husband,\
  \ but she should have had a place for secret meetings. But who knows if these meetings\
  \ have been kept secret. Perhaps the safest place was behind the bush.\nI think\
  \ they are too many \"maybe\". Maybe I just have to enjoy the gratifying memory\
  \ and go to the local sweet shop to buy some cakes. And you ... go ahead, travel\
  \ a lot and later tell me your story."
