Text: "In Sri Lanka you swerve rather than drive. Stop signs lamely referee intersections,\
  \ some are so faded it is only their circular shape which reminds of their disciplinary\
  \ role, yet most are ignored. The unwritten rule here being; the bigger you are,\
  \ the higher priority on the road. I sit back and try to look out the window. Passing\
  \ towns are as rare as clouds, as is the screech of horns that fill a suffocating\
  \ humid air.\n\nI had met my driver some twenty minutes earlier and despite brief\
  \ acquaintance we will now spend the next three days together, the places we\u2019\
  ll go are at the hand of the wheel.\n\nMilan collects me from the small town of\
  \ Sigiriya, with the aim to drive one hundred and seventy kilometres south to Nallathanniya,\
  \ a base town before the impressive Adams Peak, the short distance is a heartbreaking\
  \ six hour drive, seemingly superfluous given the distance. With tourism contributing\
  \ to one in ten jobs in Sri Lanka, Milan looks back over his shoulder in the rear\
  \ view mirror at me to see if there was any future in the behind.\n\nThe problem\
  \ in this situation was affording the driver and sometimes privilege can be perilous.\n\
  \nMilan asks every so often \u201CMy dear friend, would you like to visit the temple?\u201D\
  \ and \u201CMy dear friend, would you like to see the waterfall?\u201D I had rather\
  \ hoped he preferred the formal epithet out of attachment reasons rather than recollection.\L\
  \L \n\nWhile finding the similarities in our seemingly separate cultures we discuss\
  \ our views on rental prices, social media and our favourite beer, but there is\
  \ an elephant in our presence and it wasn\u2019t the one walking beside us, a common\
  \ sight in rural Sri Lanka. We found our differences in the most unlikely of places,\
  \ over lunch. You see, Milan wanted to dazzle me the sights and Hallmarks of his\
  \ country and my declines had jolted his spirit. My chosen lunch venue was the last\
  \ straw: an open air, street kitchen and it was not up to standard.\n\nThe confusion\
  \ over our agreement had come to head; he thought he was to guide, I had expected\
  \ he was to drive. The disagreement was hard to ignore given my active attempt to\
  \ avoid a tour guide, opting to see the real Sri Lanka for what it is, and no amount\
  \ of temples and lookouts were going to make me feel connected with the people and\
  \ it\u2019s land. \n\nIt was here, in the open air kitchen with; stove tops that\
  \ fog up your glasses, of spatulas that scrape hot pots by ladies who shriek when\
  \ monkeys snatch fresh batches of Kottu Roti. Of banana leaves served as crockery\
  \ and the communal wash basin with the bar of soap in its own soup of questionable\
  \ water.\n\nThe sights, the sounds and the smells of the mundane suburban life of\
  \ a Lankan on their lunch break were the coconut in the coconut sambal. Milan found\
  \ that troublesome because what most travellers wanted was less. Less heat, less\
  \ noise and more calm to all the calamity.  \L\nThe next three days with Milan were\
  \ trying as we tugged at our own interests and agendas, but what sticks to mind\
  \ is that open air kitchen; the decadent string hopper, the coconut kalu dodol that\u2019\
  s cooked for hours and the vibrantly coloured dahl. This to me this was the real\
  \ Sri Lanka and I loved every second."
