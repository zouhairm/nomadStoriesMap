Text: "This begins with a tale of love where I flew over seas to follow the (ex) French\
  \ girl of my dreams. Having not learned the language of love I could not get a working\
  \ visa in France so I ended up living and working in hostels in London. Being sick\
  \ of the typical \"Aussies in London\" charade, myself and a mate quit out jobs\
  \ to go back packing across the cold land like Frodo and Sam so to speak, which\
  \ is exactly what I pictured us as. So planning on walking from London to Edinburgh\
  \ with a detour to Cardiff and not other planning that that we set off with our\
  \ tents and pots and pans like her Or thinking we were the next best thing. \nBeing\
  \ free with no technology and walking and sleeping amongst nature was incredible\
  \ and having never camped before myself I learned some new skills. \nAfter three\
  \ days of blissful peace we have up our quest and caught a coach to Cardiff where\
  \ we walked a popular trail (Taff Trail) to The Brecon Beacons. The three day hike\
  \ was glorious. Walking through the mildly warm valleys of Southern Wales made us\
  \ feel like we were in middle earth, turning the trek into a mini pub crawl along\
  \ the way to the destination. \nDay one of this hike led us to a man singing  quite\
  \ happily riding his bike full of camping gear around the tri countries of the UK.\
  \ We stopped and shared tales of each other in which he was an old university professor\
  \ whom had been fired for selling weed to students in campus and off he rode. \n\
  Day two of this led out paths to cross again and feeling quite uncomfortable as\
  \ he tried to encourage some illicit substances upon us we swiftly left and made\
  \ our way through and abandoned rail way tunnel u see a Brecon mountain way. Emerging\
  \ from the other side we set up camp in a random field and awoke the next morning\
  \ being surrounded by wild horses.\nThat third day we m a de the peak to Brecon\
  \ and accomplished that amazing feat so we decided that we were done with walking\
  \ and caught a 17 hour bus to Edinburgh then another to Fort William in Scotland\
  \ to climb the UKs largest mountain, Ben Nevis. \nWe set up camp and got to talking\
  \ to some other hikers who told us of this beautiful waterfall to visit. We had\
  \ three days of beautiful forecast so we thought we had time.\nLater that night\
  \ we drank a bottle of Jack Daniels between us and had the brilliant idea for a\
  \ stroll the waterfall but accidently ended up slowly making our way up hill towards\
  \ the peak of the mountain. We didn't realize until half way up when looking back,\
  \ on a full moon night,all we could see were tiny twinkling camp fires from out\
  \ site. We argued about going back But decided that we had come this far do we best\
  \ keep going. \nThe alcohol was wearing off and we were regretting our lack of planning\
  \ for food and water but we powered on. \nPhantom peak after phantom peak we finally\
  \ made it to the top, 5 hours later. The full moon k  one side and the sun was minutes\
  \ away from dawning. \nI hoped up a refuge shelter on top of the peak and there\
  \ was a German fellow resting for the night and wanted to be woken up in time for\
  \ the sun rise and thanked us for waking him.\nHe set up and we waiting and just\
  \ as the dawn was breaking the icy cold clouds cake flowing over us like a tsunami\
  \ from the sky and we decided to head back. We passed likely a thousand people all\
  \ hopefully to see the view which had now been blocked.\nWe finally got back to\
  \ camp and passed out and I drifted off to sleep to the sound of the putter patter\
  \ of the rain on our tent which continued for another two days afterwards in which\
  \ we returned to London with a lifetime full of memories."
