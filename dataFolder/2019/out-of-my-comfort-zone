Text: "Traveling is something that puts me out of my comfort zone, I look forward\
  \ to it to wander somewhere I never been; somewhere I always wanted to go, somewhere\
  \ I feel happy & blessed. Each adventure provides my mind and soul with an important\
  \ boost that makes the rest of my life seem even more worthwhile. I personally feel\
  \ that traveling isn\u2019t always pretty neither it is comfortable but such journey\u2019\
  s change us. It leaves a mark on our memory, on our consciousness, on our heart\
  \ and body. From each journey we take something and hopefully we leave something\
  \ good behind too. In the beginning traveling used to leave me speechless but in\
  \ the end it all used to turn me into a story teller. During one such trip to London\
  \ I happened to meet a fellow traveller at a hostel who told me that we all travel,\
  \ some of us forever, to seek other places, to blend and get to know their culture,\
  \ way of living and all this to cherish our memories, our souls. \nEach of my journey\
  \ also sums up my desire to keep learning by expanding my social circle, experiences\
  \ and external influences. And since I am looking forward to being a Travel vlogger/Blogger\
  \ each trips adds to my persona. I\u2019ve made many friends around the world, and\
  \ it\u2019s the time I\u2019ve spent with them that has made my travels so fulfilling.\
  \ Who I meet and spend time with is always more memorable and important than simply\
  \ crossing another city or country off of my bucket list. Another gladdest moment\
  \ of my life is my departure into an unknown land. Stepping into the land of some\
  \ beautiful castles and lakes (Scotland), wowing stories from the past attached\
  \ to it is even more like a dream come true. Scotland trip was me was one of the\
  \ memorable chapter in my travel diary. Story behind each castle, kings & mind blowing\
  \ stories is tantalizing. That trip led me to see the journey of how a whisky is\
  \ made. I personally feel that \u201CNo place is ever as bad as others tell me it\u2019\
  s going to be.\u201D It\u2019s easy to get jaded, but worth every effort.\nIt is\
  \ said that every journey has a story, a story of hope. My one such trip was to\
  \ Dubai- The land of culture, spices, supercars \u201CBurj khalifa\u201D and many\
  \ other wonderful architecture. I got intrigued with the colors, the people, their\
  \ smiles, the energy and their spirit. During this trip every spot attracted me\
  \ due to its differences. Truly an unforgettable trip. Even Abu Dhabi wasn\u2019\
  t less in any way as compared to Dubai. Truly these two trips were the most nonpareil.\
  \ \nMy most recent trip was to China- A mix of modern and historic architecture.\
  \ The palaces and other huge structure were just engrossing which even includes\
  \ \u201CThe Great Wall of China\u201D.\nI consider traveling to be modest. We get\
  \ to know what a tiny place we occupy in the world. Also most of these trips that\
  \ I did was solo. When I stopped waiting for others to join me on my travels, I\
  \ finally began seeing the world the way I\u2019d always wanted to. It really goes\
  \ well with the saying \u201CThe use of traveling is to regulate imagination with\
  \ reality, and instead of thinking of how things may be, see them as they are.\u201D\
