Text: "All intentions of eating mindfully over the next two days of travel go out\
  \ the window when instead of exchanging the excess Thai Baht in my wallet I use\
  \ it as an excuse to spend every last bit on food at Bangkok International Airport.\
  \ I then board my flight and scoff everything the stewardess offers me even though\
  \ I feel like I could vomit from my pre-flight airport binge. I\u2019m nervous,\
  \ unsure and eating to distract myself from my anxiety as I take my biggest step\
  \ outside of my travel comfort zone yet. \n\nI\u2019m en route to Playa Gigante,\
  \ Nicaragua, to live with a local family and study Spanish. Up for a challenge and\
  \ ready to use my brain beyond deciding what culinary delights to nosh each day,\
  \ I booked this next leg of my wanderings the week before. My vocab extends no further\
  \ beyond English but there was no time to arm myself with the basics of Espanol\
  \ as I wrapped up my time mastering the art of \u2018\u2019doing nothing\u2019\u2019\
  \ in Pai, the creative hippy Mecca of Northern Thailand. After 3 months in South\
  \ East Asia, I'm undecided if ignoring the Smart Traveler warnings and advice from\
  \ well-traveled friends about Nicaragua's current situation and level of safety\
  \ was a great idea. The high sensation seeker in me says ''hell yes'' but there\
  \ was still lingering fear and thoughts of ''what have I signed up for?'' \n\nMy\
  \ first stop is a 2-hour layover at Shanghai Airport before boarding my flight to\
  \ LAX. I hit the long haul flight jackpot and score a row to myself. More food,\
  \ red wine and one and a half films later, I pass out and wake not long before arriving\
  \ in the U.S. After hearing horror stories about border control, I nervously wait\
  \ in line at LAX praying to the universe that I completed my ESTA visa correctly.\
  \ Another win, this time in the form of an all too casual officer who is so relaxed\
  \ he's about to slide off his chair and I'm granted entry without question. \n\n\
  Next stop Hollywood airport and a 6 hour stop over. I take the lovely security guards\
  \ hot tip and head to \"Lesters Diner\" to fill up my time. I'm stoked when I get\
  \ there and it's quintessential American with cops eating breakfast at 5 am, old\
  \ guys in trucker hats sat at the counter as they have for the past 15 years, waitresses\
  \ who look like they've worked there every day forever and who would like to tell\
  \ their boss to stick it and never pour another percolated coffee again, ridiculous\
  \ plates of greasy food and a cabinet full of over the top pies. Of course i \"\
  when in Rome'' and order an omelette that could feed four, a side of potatoes and\
  \ toast with blueberry jelly. I manage to resist the pie but only because I've drunk\
  \ 3 cups of bottomless coffee and feel high as a kite. I order an uber and head\
  \ back to the airport. The driver and I exchange details of our homelands and chat\
  \ about Australia's ''deadly'' animals. With no energy to defend my natives, I laugh\
  \ off his statement that Aussies and Yanks are ''similar''. \n\nI board my final\
  \ flight to Managua, Nicaragua and notice I'm the only non-Hispanic passenger. I\
  \ distract myself for the 2hr 45 minutes with a crime podcast, probably not the\
  \ best choice when questioning my destinations safety. \n\nMy plane lands in Managua\
  \ at 2 pm, I'm delirious and smelling like I'm still floating around Pai. I breeze\
  \ through immigration and collect my bag. The airport is small and the facilities\
  \ obviously those of a 3rd world country. I look anxiously through the crowd of\
  \ locals waiting for their loved ones and spot the white piece of paper with my\
  \ name. I walk towards the brightest white smile, it belongs to my driver, Dolman.\
  \ ''Hola Linsy!'' His voice immediately reverberates the overwhelming sense of unfamiliarity\
  \ and my whole body melts with relief. Fear is replaced with excitement and uncertainty\
  \ with curiosity. I smile. I'm awake. I'm ready and remember why I pushed my comfort\
  \ zone to Nicaragua, to feel all extremes as I enter the unknown."
