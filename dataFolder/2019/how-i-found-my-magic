Text: I remember being a teenager very vividly. The moodiness, the anger, the triggers,
  the pressure; it was such a confusing time in my life. I remember being so angry
  at the world because I felt that no one understood what I was going through. When
  I graduated high school, I was at the peak of my angst. I remember listening to
  a TED Talk by Rick Steves, where he encouraged people to travel and to broaden your
  perspective. So I packed a suitcase, and went on a road trip down the East Cost,
  starting from Manhattan down to Miami, Florida. It was an exhilarating experience.
  However, I made a stop at Nashville, Tennessee and I fell in love. I remember getting
  out of my car and walking down Music Row. The people were so welcoming and open,
  and curious about me! am a naturally shy person, but I'll never forget when the
  bartender pulled me up to the stage to sing along with the band. I just felt my
  anger melting away, my angst just subsiding and I thought to myself, I want to feel
  this way all the time. Nashville made me feel alive, and I remember just wanting
  more, wanting to be at the heart of the city. Ever since that trip, I have made
  it a point to travel to at least one country a year. I make it a mission to stock
  up my vacation hours and with surgical expertise, use up my holiday hours just so
  I can see how others live. Traveling makes me feel alive, and it opens up my eyes
  to see that I'm not alone. In fact, I'm a tiny, little person in a vast expanse
  of humanity. That feeling may make you feel small, but it should empower you to
  see how much impact you make in the world just by being you.
