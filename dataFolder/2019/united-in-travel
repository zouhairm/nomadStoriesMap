Text: "I met Janine at the gate counter at Toronto Pearson International Airport on\
  \ our way to Quito, and she quickly became a friend, a travel companion, and a catalyst\
  \ for some of my fondest memories in Ecuador. \n\nAt our departure gate, United\
  \ Airlines staff were looking for five ticket holders for the flight to Houston\
  \ departing imminently (the first of my three-leg trip to Quito) to volunteer stay\
  \ back. The flight was to follow an alternate route and needed to lighten the load\
  \ to make it safely. The volunteers would receive new flight itineraries covered\
  \ by United Airlines, complimentary hotel rooms and meals, and, the real incentive,\
  \ a $1000 USD flight credit for future travel. Despite my overwhelming excitement\
  \ to travel overseas for the first time in over three years, the flight credit was\
  \ too tempting for me to not consider delaying my departure. \n\nI approached the\
  \ counter and stood beside another solo traveler, Janine, a friendly woman a few\
  \ years younger than me with a big smile and an even bigger love for chatting. She\
  \ too was volunteering to change her flight. While United Airlines staff revised\
  \ our travel schedules and issued vouchers, I learned that Janine was born in Canada\
  \ and had moved to Quito a few years prior to teach English. She lived in an apartment\
  \ owned by her grandparents, two native Ecuadorians who now lived in Toronto but\
  \ who returned to Quito to escape the harsh Canadian winters. \n\nWith our new flight\
  \ itineraries and vouchers in-hand, we set off for the Crowne Plaza. We dined together\
  \ that evening, shared breakfast the next morning, and remained travel companions\
  \ until we reached Quito more than 24 hours after meeting. Both traveling alone,\
  \ our fast friendship helped the time \u2018fly\u2019 by! It even felt only slightly\
  \ unwise to accept Janine\u2019s offer to stay at her apartment that night when\
  \ we realized that, by the time we had landed, it was too late for me to check into\
  \ my hostel. Any reservations I had about staying with someone who I had just met\
  \ melted away when I walked into Janine\u2019s warm, comfortable flat and met her\
  \ welcoming grandparents, Julia and Carlos. \n\nWe chatted briefly before my hosts\
  \ showed me to my room for the night. The next day was December 31st, and I was\
  \ to set off early for Canoa to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve on the beach. However,\
  \ over hot coffee and fresh pastries, I learned that New Year\u2019s Eve in Ecuador\
  \ is a much larger celebration than it is in Ontario. Bus tickets sell-out as the\
  \ locals flee the city for parties and getaways in surrounding towns. As such, the\
  \ next bus to Canoa with available seats was leaving the night of January 1st. I\
  \ was stuck in Quito.\n\nWhen traveling, things don\u2019t always go to plan, and\
  \ in this case, disruptions to my plans worked out in my favour. I was grateful\
  \ to be invited to spend the day with Janine, Carlos and Julia, to exchange travel\
  \ stories with them, and to talk about our families and passions. They were fabulous\
  \ sources of advice about traveling throughout Ecuador, and provided an excellent\
  \ opportunity for me to practice my Spanish.  \n\nThat night, I celebrated New Year\u2019\
  s Eve with the my new Ecuadorian \u2018family\u2019 and their friends. I learned\
  \ about multiple fascinating traditions that make this occasion so important and\
  \ joyous for Ecuadorians \u2013 dancing in the streets, burning papier-m\xE2ch\xE9\
  \ dolls to symbolize the cleansing of the bad from the previous year, eating twelve\
  \ grapes at midnight for good luck over the next year, and running around the block\
  \ with luggage to ensure a year of abundant travel. \n\nI had an unforgettable time\
  \ with these kind people and I learned so much about Ecuador, its culture, and its\
  \ traditions. When we said goodbye, I left with their contact information and an\
  \ invitation to visit again soon, in either Ecuador or Canada! Making these connections\
  \ kicked my trip off to a fabulous start, and I set out with an open mind and heart.\
  \ The amazing thing \u2013 it all started before I even left Canada, at the flight\
  \ gate counter!"
