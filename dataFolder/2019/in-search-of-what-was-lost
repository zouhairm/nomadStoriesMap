Text: "I had come to Colombia with no real purpose except for the fact that I could.\
  \ My best friend was stationed in Bogota and I thought why not visit her? It\u2019\
  s always been a country that I\u2019ve been saving for my travels. \nI didn\u2019\
  t like Bogota. But nevermind that, Colombia had so much more to offer. My best friend\
  \ had to work during the week but on the weekends she\u2019d fly to join me in whatever\
  \ city I landed in and this time I had landed in Santa Marta. She had the brilliant\
  \ idea of trekking to what was sold as \u2018Colombian Machu Picchu\u2019 but with\
  \ a more ominous name, much like the fear mongering that shrouds the country. It\
  \ was called La Ciudad Perdida - the Lost City. \nSanta Marta is unfortunately a\
  \ port city. The waters yellow at night not by the street light but by the high\
  \ turbidity dredged up during the day by large tankers. It was uncomfortably humid\
  \ despite being on the coast. The cool night breeze just not enough to give anyone\
  \ any relief. Santa Marta\u2019s only redeeming feature was being the entryway to\
  \ the magnificent jungle and national park that was once the home of Pre-Columbus\
  \ Colombians, the ones that left the city in the middle of the jungle only leaving\
  \ its name.\nAs we trekked through the thick sludge befitting of landslides, thanks\
  \ to the recent rains, the jungle was unusually quiet. In fact, it didn\u2019t have\
  \ any of the sounds you\u2019d expect of a lush greenscape such as this. The giant\
  \ strangler figs were still, the green leaves of unnamed ferns immovable. The air\
  \ saturated with condensation where every breath felt like a gasp for the tiny molecules\
  \ of oxygen that remained. We might as well have been wearing rebreathers underwater.\
  \ Our Indigenous guide Omar, a far off descendent of the former inhabitants of La\
  \ Ciudad Perdida (or so he and the brochure said) took a pinkish purple leaf from\
  \ an unidentifiable (at least to me) tree and held it up covering the lower half\
  \ of his round smooth face. He then made low growling sounds, with increasing pitch,\
  \ volume and intensity - mimicking the howler monkeys that reputedly populated the\
  \ area. We all laughed at his silliness not yet realising the tragedy behind his\
  \ mimicry. At a scheduled pit stop with pineapples and watermelons - fruits of our\
  \ pack donkey\u2019s hard labour - we asked when we would see a real howler monkey.\
  \ He immediately hushed us, one finger over his lips. Cupping his ear with his other\
  \ hand, he implored us to listen, looking first to the left, then to the right.\
  \ We followed him. Silence. A minute goes by, more silence. The silence begins to\
  \ feel irritating, unwelcome, making us painfully aware. We had not heard anything\
  \ up until this point. Where had all the life gone? What strange wind has come through\
  \ to suck the life out of the jungle as it swept out the inhabitants of La Ciudad\
  \ Perdida? Finally Omar\u2019s stoney face broke and solemnly said \u2018la guerra\
  \ contra las drogas\u2019. The War on Drugs. He mimed the planes that sprayed the\
  \ jungle with a herbicide to poison the illicit coca plantations deep within the\
  \ jungle. Quick, efficient and cost effective. While the Americans assured them\
  \ that it was harmless to humans, it had the unintended effect of killing everything\
  \ else. Omar picked up the pinkish purple leaf and resumed his howler monkey act.\
  \ \nWhen we finally reached our fabled destination, Omar immediately shushed us\
  \ again. Pointing to an impossibly tall tree with thick branches and dense foliage,\
  \ directing our gaze upwards. \n\u201CMira, alla\u201D as he leaned in closer to\
  \ turn our heads slightly to the right. \n\u201CI didn't expect to find any left\u201D\
  \ I whispered, gaze fixed, fearing a breath would rob us of this moment. \n\u201C\
  Hoooowwwwwww haaaaa haaaa\u201D Omar laughed uncontrollably, dancing with his leaf,\
  \ interchanging it like a Japanese kabuki dancer. \nFor the rest of the trek back,\
  \ Omar re-enacted the scene; him dancing on the ruined foundations of his ancestors\
  \ laughing at the gullible tourists, while our faces burned with embarrassment.\
  \ Or was it the stifling humidity?"
