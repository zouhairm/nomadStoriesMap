Text: "Crying out load in my room, terrified and worried because I could not find\
  \ my USA visa-card to cross the border: \"Not again, not again... NOT AGAIN!...\
  \ I left it here, I left it here...\" scratching my head and turning everything\
  \ upside down, from books to clothes, searching back and forth the same places,\
  \ hitting my head over and over just to try to remember where I put it.   As the\
  \ 2nd time it happened to me, I knew what was coming through: a high possibility\
  \ of being denied a visa one or maybe twice because of some stupid excuse, a few\
  \ hundred dollars lost and possibly some years until I get one.   I was so sure\
  \ I left it in my red backpack right before leaving because I knew I was not going\
  \ to use it in South America. Living in the border sucks.  \nA day before, happy\
  \ that I was getting on the plane from Medellin to Mexico, I found myself lucky\
  \ to leave the passport on my luggage and being able to go back to my country...\
  \ as my arms and head got heavier I felt into a deep sleep on that very late-night\
  \ flight, that only my hunger woke me up:  \"Miss, do you have something to eat?\
  \ I felt asleep\".  -I asked the flight attendant.  \"Oh I\xB4m sorry, food non\
  \ taken is already polluted and we are going to start our arrival now, but I can\
  \ give you some peanuts\" - She said.  So that was it; no phone, no wallet, no food\
  \ and a 4-hour stop over in Mexico City's airport without WiFi, plus a small 2.5\
  \ hours trip ahead that no-way was going to serve me food in-'flight.  I felt so\
  \ lost and powerless; it would be more than 24 hrs since my last meal by the time\
  \ I arrived to my destination. \nMan, that last meal was tasty, good sushi shared\
  \ together with my friend Josue, who took care of all my stuff before my trip to\
  \ Peru; I was so happy that I left everything I could with him and borrowed as little\
  \ as possible on my trip to Machu Picchu; thus, despite I got scared when I didn't\
  \ find my visa there, I thought that for sure I left it with my parents.  I left\
  \ a card with him, lucky me... but the one I didn't use so often, so I couldn't\
  \ actually remember my pin-code and later blocked in Mexico City. I left also my\
  \ driver's licenses and Swedish Id's, but no USA visa card.  Also, everything that\
  \ has to be remembered was on my phone, so again I was pretty grateful when that\
  \ Colombian migrant agent had my friend's address registered on my way back.  \n\
  I remember using everybody's phone in Peru: the flight attendant who wanted to make\
  \ sure I had a flight back to Mexico once in Colombia, the clerk on Western Union\
  \ to pick up the money I sent from my e-bank to my sister back in Juarez, the guy\
  \ who helped me to go to the tourist police once I found out my wallet and phone\
  \ did not arrived their destination on my purse. \nI did everything to get it back,\
  \ playing detective until getting into the city's cameras department, wrote the\
  \ cab's phone and call it.  No answer... I visited the 2nd hand stores to find it:\
  \  No phone or wallet; I sat down the plaza to read patiently all small white cab's\
  \ number without luck.  I blame myself most of all, for not getting a hostel near\
  \ downtown, knowing that I could walk all-drunk to sleep, instead of taking a taxi\
  \ God know's where.   Strangely I also blame whoever says it was my fault for not\
  \ putting attention... I answer back: \"The only one guilty of this fault is the\
  \ cab driver, who didn't call me back the moment I left the sit next to him\"...\
  \ a guy who strangely waited longer time on the street, saw me cross the street\
  \ and got into my building's door before he started driving.  \nIf he knew what\
  \ would happen... would he do it again?"
