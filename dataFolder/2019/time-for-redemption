Text: "Unfortunately I don\u2019t have much of a travel story since I\u2019ve never\
  \ really had the opportunity to travel. I majored in Organizational Communication\
  \ with an Emphasis in Public Relations with the dream and aspiration to become a\
  \ well known writer. These past two years have been a time of pain, loss, grieving\
  \ and did I mention loss? After having pursued what I truly believed Christ was\
  \ calling me to do which consisted of putting my Journalistic skills to use, I jumped\
  \ on the opportunity. An opportunity which led me to confirm some of my suspicions,\
  \ and whic led me to lose precious time with my oldest brother before he was called\
  \ back by Christ. Christ continues to put writing into my heart and to accomplish\
  \ what He has called me to accomplish and I feel this confirmed even more by coming\
  \ across such an amazing opportunity such as this one! This is what my Journalistic\
  \ soul is screaming for! An opportunity to branch out of my comfort zone into the\
  \ unknown for just the right amount of time that my ptsd will allow while getting\
  \ an opportunity to travel to a country I\u2019ve never been to, while feeling at\
  \ ease because it\u2019s to broaden a skill and passion which has been put into\
  \ my heart by the One and all high mighty, Christ. Thank you for this opportunity\
  \ and I hope to be blessed with taking part in it."
