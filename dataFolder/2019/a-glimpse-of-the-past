Text: "It was an unexpected short term visit to one of the old kingdoms in Java island.\
  \ I had an opportunity to pay a visit to Keraton (Palace) Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat,\
  \ in Yogya, Central Java province of Indonesia.\n\nI was in Yogya to pay a visit\
  \ to my step brother and my step grandparents. We stayed at their house for a week,\
  \ during my school holiday.  It was a sunny day and very hot. Although had eaten\
  \ an ice cream cone, still it didn't satisfy me. Something was missing, an empty\
  \ hole inside my heart. My father suddenly asked me what I was thinking, due to\
  \ blank expression of my face. I told him about the empty feeling inside me and\
  \ a hunger of exploring the city, but not knowing where to start. He paused for\
  \ few seconds, then proposed a short visit to the palace of the Governor of Yogyakarta\
  \ province. At first, I wasn't very excited, but I didn't want to let him down.\
  \ So, I agreed and prepared myself.\n\nAfter half an hour of travelling, we arrived\
  \ at the front gate. Surrounded by approximately 6 meters of white walls, the palace\
  \ has been opened several of the rooms for public. We were greeted by the guards\
  \ who wore traditional uniforms, spears, and a lot of palace servants. It is commonly\
  \ the palace servants are fully devoted to the Sultan (the King of the Keraton)\
  \ and his family. We had a chance to take a look at the Sultan's throne area, catches\
  \ a glimpse of the pictures of previous Princesses and wives of previous Sultans.\
  \ \n\nWhen I touched the bed that belonged to a Princess, an air of mystery suddenly\
  \ appeared. I couldn't imagine how she survived her life right in the palace, where\
  \ everything is arranged, no freedom of her own, but full of internal conflicts.\
  \ As a woman, they didn't had any rights to make a speech, choose anything they\
  \ want, even to continue formal education. It was changed by mid of 1900, by letters\
  \ written by a Javanese noble woman, Raden Ajeng Kartini, who poured her feelings\
  \ of the culture. Her correspondence with her pen friend in the Netherlands was\
  \ published, and she was named as one of Indonesian national hero, for defending\
  \ women's right of pursuing higher formal education. \n\nAfter we finished out short\
  \ tour, as usual, attack of empty stomach caught us. A palace servant guided both\
  \ of us to a well known restaurant, at the corner of the palace. To my surprise,\
  \ the restaurant serves all favorite foods and beverages of the Sultans and his\
  \ family. Some of them are fusion food of Javanese culture and a little bit influenced\
  \ by Dutch culinary. I had an unforgettable moments with Beer Jawa (Javanese herbal\
  \ drink), Salad Huzar (fruit and mayonnaise salad), and a plate of Bistik Lidah\
  \ (slices of beef tongue with potato wedges, vegetables, and special sauce). My\
  \ father indulged himself with Nasi Goreng Jawa (traditional fried rice) and Udang\
  \ Bakar Madu (grilled giant prawns sprinkled with special sauce). For desserts,\
  \ both of us were impressed with Manuk Nom, a traditional pudding made of sticky\
  \ rice, pandan, and eaten with melinjo crackers.\n\nAlright, I might not a princess\
  \ or a queen consort (there is no line of succession for female descendants!), but\
  \ visiting Keraton, food tasting of Sultan's daily menus, were such a priceless\
  \ and memorable experience for me. I even forgot to take pictures, anyway, I might\
  \ not needed to do so. I am so grateful not living in the past, but it doesn't mean\
  \ I could forget our ancestors's richness of history, culture, and culinary."
