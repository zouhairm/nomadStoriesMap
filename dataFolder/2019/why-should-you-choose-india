Text: "With over 29 states filled with million of diversities in each aspect, you\
  \ still haven't seen the best of what India is there to show you. Dwell yourself\
  \ into the culture, the history, the architecture, the mythologies, the peaks, the\
  \ deserts, the beaches and what not - the list is endless! Bharat (India was given\
  \ by the Britishers) is a rich land of unique, mind boggling and fully potential\
  \ of why should you visit this place. \nYou talk about the oldest human civilization\
  \ of the world, we have it, you ask about the spiciest food we have it, you ask\
  \ about mind blowing mythologies we definitely have it! From the beautiful valleys\
  \ of Kashmir to the temples of South India that are loaded with grandeur, from the\
  \ typical new modern architecture to the mud houses, India is a vast land to experience\
  \ it all. Unity in Diversity. \n\nI never thought I would end up dropping accounts\
  \ for going to study for travel?! Yes I do study travel and tourism management and\
  \ believe me, I never had this urge to travel or even the slightest wanderlust until\
  \ and unless things keep working out and I found my way towards this. As soon as\
  \ I started going outdoors and started experiencing all, the cool breezes, the hot\
  \ summers in a desert, the local food at a homestay, I knew it then. This was the\
  \ best decision I made. It isn't just about the travel studies. You can have the\
  \ zenith of wander lust even if you are not studying the told. But for me, it did\
  \ magic and here am, sharing my experience. \nThe second part of this travel story\
  \ is my habit of writing which I am always confused about! Is it even interesting.\
  \ Am I making some sense or is this totally stupid to even write. I always loved\
  \ reading and writing. Spent hours down to write poems and indulged myself in almost\
  \ all genres of books. Last year, it striked to me to write about my travels, my\
  \ stories and make a blog or do something where I can simply share my experience\
  \ to the people. So that I could connect. But it never worked out for me. I felt\
  \ demotivated and would never have confidence to explore myself more. So here I\
  \ am, with two of my favorite things my travel and my writing. Travel makes me happy\
  \ and writing gives me peace. This what I feel is a deadly combination :)"
