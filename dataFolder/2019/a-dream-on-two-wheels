Text: "Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the \u201Ccity of sin\u201D,\
  \ which, like John Green, I\u2019d rather call \u201Ccity of freedom\u201D: Amsterdan.\
  \ \nLet me start with the fact that paradise doesn\u2019t have to be tropycal. I\
  \ was there in the summer season, but believe me, only in theory. Despite of that,\
  \ I think that the cold give to the city part of its charm, elegance and romantic\
  \ vibe. I mean, it\u2019s a beautiful place full of people with a beautiful winter\
  \ outfits riding bikes. \nIt looks like a movie scenario. With all that buildings\
  \ with the most perfect arquicteture (which includes medieval , renascentist and\
  \ modern construtions) and the poetics water channels there\xB4s always something\
  \ else to be entranced by. You can\u2019t get enough, visually saying. Since then\
  \ and to this day I want to go to Venice just because Amsterdam is also known as\
  \ \u201CNorth Venice\u201D.\nI remember to be walking by AMS's streets and be aborded\
  \ by two adorable childrens that started to talk to me in dutch. I said, in english:\
  \ sorry, I don\u2019t understand. And then, one of them took 2 seconds to remember\
  \ the word he was looking for and said: \u201CHmm, humm... Magic, Lady\u201D. And\
  \ then, they made a cute magician performance right there and I gave them a little\
  \ money. And I must say: simpathy is not a virtue specific of the kids. They all\
  \ were always kind and polite to me. And this is something I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to find because in Germany and Belgium (borders countries) I felt a little hostility.\
  \ Anyway, the local people are extremely special. And do not be alarmed if you are\
  \ easily sucked into their relaxed way of life and delicious atmosphere they inspire.\n\
  But now, let\u2019s be pragmatic and point a few places I think it\u2019s mandatory\
  \ in this trip adventure, so a local connection can be made :\nAnne Frank Museum\
  \ \u2013 in a city full of joy, there\u2019s a reminder of the sad and disturbing\
  \ side of world history. Netherlands had suffer a lot with the second war but the\
  \ history of this little girl is very much inspiring. Her strenght and hope even\
  \ in the worst moments of the humanity is something that should be praised. The\
  \ daily visits are limited, so prepare your schedule accordingly right herehttps://www.annefrank.org/en/museum/tickets/\n\
  Red Street Light \u2013 I might say: this was the most confusing place, in a matter\
  \ of what it makes me feel, that I\u2019ve ever been. It\u2019s a mixed of curiosity\
  \ and perturbing feeling. You should visit, of course, but there\u2019s a diferent\
  \ and specific vibration in this experience. \nDam Square and Royal Palace \u2013\
  \ this place is situated in the heart of the city and provide a lot of options of\
  \ things to be visited, such as art galleries and the Madame Tussauds museum, beyond\
  \ the important cerimonies that happens once in a while on the palace. If you are\
  \ interested, check more in: https://www.paleisamsterdam.nl/en/\nVONDELPARK - the\
  \ largest city park in Amsterdam, and certainly the most famous park in the Netherlands.\
  \ A stunning place loved by tourits and Amsterdammers. With a lots of visitors,\
  \ open shows and nature. It should really be in your itinerary.\nVan Gogh Museum-\
  \ the most famous works of art of one of the most iconic-legendary-breathtaking\
  \ artists of the history. I think I don\u2019t need to say anything else.\nBeyond\
  \ all of that, there\u2019s plenty of things to do. Coffe shops, bloemenmarkt, beer\
  \ bars, boats ride, houseboats and all envolved by their gorgeous arquitecture,\n\
  It\u2019s a really safe place, which might be a good option for girls travelling\
  \ alone in this crazy world we live in. As soon as I arrived at the airport, I took\
  \ a cab and talked to the driver. I was afraid of being alone there. And he told\
  \ me: \u201Cyou can be peaceful. Of course there are violence everywhere, but here\
  \ is rarely this kind of stuff. And I can see you\u2019ll have no problem because\
  \ you\u2019re a Lucky girl, once you are here.\u201D And he was right.\nAfter this\
  \ experience, I\u2019ve no doubt I Amsterdam (by the way, Museumplen also earns\
  \ your visit). You should be too."
