Text: "Fjord. A word but the most overwhelming emotions. The impressive mother Nature\
  \ drags me one more time. How lucky, how lucky to live this moment, how lucky to\
  \ stumble with people who are led by the imperious willingness of wanting to live\
  \ more and more, each time with more intensity and with more curiosity than fear.\
  \ The Sun greets us and smiles at our pace, opening our way between the frozen blocks\
  \ of the North Sea, illuminating the green and white touches that adorn the cliffs\
  \ and mountains. \nThe heat transmitted takes me to my deepest tissue, and the cool\
  \ breeze renews me. I sense that every part of me is reborn. The sunlight reflects\
  \ in the water as we pass, and a ray sunshine finds every nook and cranny of my\
  \ mind's refuge, a ray that makes life lighter, more daring, more seductive. \n\
  It resembles a story, filled with all the promises that Hollywood and those books\
  \ which you devoured made, but this time is real.\nA small house lost in a rocky\
  \ gap makes you question why. Why drive ourselves through this anxious life. Because\
  \ maybe, just maybe, a simple life is greater than yours. That perhaps your place\
  \ in the world is not to continue your career, it is not seeking the improvement\
  \ of society or of your family and friends. Perhaps happiness is between the freezing\
  \ silence of the north while you fish. While the wind cuts your breath and kindly\
  \ reminds you: you are alive. \nOh, just three words, but how brutal and terrifying\
  \ the magnitude of the world becomes after them. So vast that it dwarfs you and\
  \ lowers you. The infinite places that I would love to travel, each and every one\
  \ of them. I would love to be in each city, in each town. I am nothing, but how\
  \ great it is to be nothing compared to the beauty of the Earth."
