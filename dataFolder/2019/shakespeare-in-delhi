Text: "Last year I was invited at the National School of Drama to put on a Shakespeare\
  \ play. the experience was unique. Getting to know the students from all over India\
  \ and managing to find a common ground of understanding and aesthetic.\nThe first\
  \ read was spent trying not to have them sleep. They would fall asleep as soon as\
  \ they read their first line. Like a phone, if their brain was not actively used,\
  \ it would put itself on stand by. From the moment, we started to put on the play,\
  \ things changed. They would be so creative and energetic. They had wonderful ideas\
  \ on what their character was and how he would behave.\nThis made me realise two\
  \ things. The first one is that there are different ways of thinking and understanding;\
  \ our psychological approach of the play by just reading it and talk about it, wasn't\
  \ working because they have a physical approach of things. They would understand\
  \ the psychology of their character by playing him, moving around the space. Basically\
  \ by being him, by sensing him.\nThe second discovery was how universal Shakespeare\
  \ is. We always say that and we mean it, but we always talk within a Western culture.\
  \ I had never experienced Shakespeare through Asian eyes. The message was clear\
  \ and in tune with the Indian reality. Students felt happy to be transmitting a\
  \ such needed message as education sets you free and more specifically the idea\
  \ of educating women.\nThe play was in Hindi, the rehearsal in English and the director\
  \ I was with only spoke Spanish. I was her translator and assistant as well as the\
  \ costume and set designer (my actual job).\nThe costumes were a mixture of typical\
  \ Indian clothes and period costumes. The two worlds fitted perfectly together.\n\
  \nAt the end, the play was wonderful. European and Indian. Both cultures mixed together\
  \ and creating something bigger. The result was very well received both by NSD's\
  \ students, staff and teachers and by the general public.\nAnd we felt blessed to\
  \ experience this month and a half experience of craziness and humanity above all.\
  \ Rehearsing in a venue with dogs, cats and rats wandering around. \nSome things\
  \ go beyond a culture or even beyond a language. Ideas and communication are of\
  \ the human realm and not linked to a specific tradition.\nThis experience made\
  \ me love Delhi and India even more. I felt at home even if I was clearly not a\
  \ local. I felt welcomed. In a natural way by some people, in wonder by others,\
  \ as a funny thing by some. But in a way, always welcomed."
