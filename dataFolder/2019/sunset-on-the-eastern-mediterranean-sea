Text: "Before the sunlight dimmed completely, a moment before the last orange fingers\
  \ of warmth disappeared below the horizon, a pair of travellers climbed on deck\
  \ to breathe in the evening and ready themselves for the 15-hour trip across the\
  \ Mediterranean to the shores of Lebanon. \u201CIt\u2019s not a mistake. Plenty\
  \ of planes fly to Beirut every day. But we are sailing to Lebanon!\u201D\n\nOne\
  \ part vain consolation, one part rueful acknowledgement, our conversation attempted\
  \ to lighten the journey to Tripoli from little-known Ta\u015Fucu on the southern\
  \ Turkish coast. It was a trip timed to Eid al-Adha, a long holiday at the universities\
  \ where we worked as Fulbright English instructors. Although Turkish cities are\
  \ well-connected via Istanbul, we had spread out our Google maps and discovered\
  \ that traveling by ferry would also allow for trips to nearby Mersin and Adana.\
  \ Savvy trip-planning isn\u2019t necessarily centered on the easiest way of passage;\
  \ rather, anticipating departures from a straight line has never failed to yield\
  \ new friends.\n\nThese acquaintances were fig orchard barons, wine-fermenting Couchsurfing\
  \ hosts, and Turkish truck drivers bound for Iraq. One year of Turkish from eavesdropping\
  \ on my students and tea with the neighbor ladies helped me recognize words like\
  \ m\xFClteci when the captain was pointing at the refugee families, evraklar when\
  \ asked for our documents, and d\xF6nd\xFCrmek when I realized that instead of a\
  \ pleasure ride, this was a return to Syria via Lebanon.\n\nThe sun suddenly slipped\
  \ out of view and the sky turned away, not wanting to acknowledge the too quick\
  \ departure of a friend. An unforgiving chill promised nighttime winds, and I reached\
  \ for a sweatshirt and nodded in agreement. \u201CNothing is a mistake, if we believe\
  \ in the written-ness of it all.\u201D \n\nWe descended back down to the main level,\
  \ a sad area of nubby red carpeting and empty concession equipment. Most of the\
  \ female passengers wore the most conservative style of Islamic dress; I tugged\
  \ at a now-useless sweatshirt, trying to distract myself from the stuffy stillness\
  \ of cabin air and despair. \n\n\u201CSennn? Ya-baan?\u201D Syrian mothers wondered\
  \ aloud about our foreignness. Brave kids asked in halting English where we were\
  \ going, a funny question given that the destination of the boat was clearly Lebanon.\
  \ The captain had even cornered us with a \u201CK\u0131br\u0131s -- o tarafta!\u201D\
  \ similarly convinced that we were Cyprus passengers and gestured to our assumed\
  \ compatriots in Birkenstocks and bucket hats. \n\nOne high school girl, Amina,\
  \ was keen to try out some English and thus served as our informant for what-the-heck-is-going-on\
  \ in the trip. Amina was sure she wasn\u2019t returning to Turkey--in high spirits\
  \ typical of youth with intact dreams, she spoke instead of dreams to study in Germany\
  \ once her English improved. Amina introduced us to her cousin who shared the same\
  \ dream, though reservedness or a deeper reality prevented her from lighting up\
  \ as Amina did. Amina\u2019s mother was even more conservative with words--in any\
  \ language--and urged Amina to sleep, to prepare for \u201Cthe journey back.\u201D\
  \n\nWe must have fallen asleep in the booths of the cafeteria, because hopes articulated\
  \ in the dark vanish in sunlight too bright. I found Amina in the line of families\
  \ anxiously eyeing the port, and scribbled down my email address. \u201CIf you need\
  \ anything, one day or ever!\u201D Amina\u2019s eyes widened in surprised gratitude,\
  \ and then she scrunched her fists into pockets to produce weathered Lebanese bills\
  \ she had certainly hidden away for years. \u201CFor you! For you trip! Have good\
  \ trip!\u201D\n\nI looked away, at anything else, as the line became the chaos of\
  \ people trying to run past the bus waiting to drive directly to Syria. I wondered\
  \ so many things, about place and space and time and where were we and where are\
  \ we going and why is that unmarked bus so terrible and so benign. I wondered if\
  \ Amina would write, and why our vacation in Beirut was in such stark contrast to\
  \ Amina\u2019s bumpy bus ride. \n\nI wondered if Amina noticed I hadn\u2019t wished\
  \ her a good trip in return, if perhaps I should have, and if that's what she had\
  \ wanted or needed to hear in another one of those moments too quick, when sun warmth\
  \ disappears."
