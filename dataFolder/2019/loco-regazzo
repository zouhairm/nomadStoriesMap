Text: "A lone whistle blows on the only departing train at a tiny train station in\
  \ the middle of Tuscany somewhere. \nA slightly groggy, but wise young vagabond\
  \ is snapped out of her early-morning exhaustion by the shrill sound. \nSuddenly\
  \ she leaps up & lurches her way towards the train she\u2019s meant to be boarding!\
  \ \n\u2018Dammit\u2019, she mumbles, as she stumbles down the walkway towards the\
  \ soon-to-depart train. She WILL NOT miss this train just because she\u2019s fallen\
  \ asleep at the wrong time! \nThe doors close & smack her bum on the way in. \n\
  She waddles her way along the narrow aisle; giant backpack knocking each seat along\
  \ the empty carriage. Awesome-no screaming babies or annoying pick-pockets eyeing\
  \ her off--afterall she\u2019s not entirely inconspicuous with her backpack! \n\
  She feels a little uneasy in the quiet cabin solo, so she shuffles her way to the\
  \ door of the next cabin, hitting the \u2018Aperto\u2019 button. The door slides\
  \ open & she\u2019s faced with another empty cabin. \nStrange. But obviously not\
  \ many people heading out of Tuscany today. \nThe uneasy feeling sits in her stomach.\
  \ \nShe shuffles her way to the next cabin-the train starts moving & she\u2019s\
  \ relieved. \nThen the train lurches awkwardly to the right & slows to walking pace.\
  \ \nStrange, she thinks to herself again. But Im lucky to have the cabin to myself\
  \ she mulls as she settles into her seat. \nSuddenly the train slows, and the steady\
  \  motion lurches to a halt. \nScreeeech.\nWhat the fuck? She stands up from her\
  \ seat & peers out the grotty windows, trying to make out where they are stopping\
  \ so suddenly. \nShe\u2019s faced with a very unlikely scenario. \nA line of identical\
  \ train engines & carriages to the one that she\u2019s in is to her left.\nShe races\
  \ over to the right side of the carriage. Peering through the dirty glass, she sees\
  \ a mirror image on the right. What the fuck?! The train has stopped all movement\
  \ and, come to think of it, all sound now! \nNo. No. No. \nShe races to the carriage\
  \ door & hits the Aperto button. \nNothing. She hits it again, harder. \nNothing.\
  \ She stifles a funny squealing noise as she considers her predicament & comes to\
  \ the realisation she\u2019s now locked in a train in the middle of the engine yard,\
  \ in a foreign country with no food & water and noone has a clue where she is. Not\
  \ to mention no way to get out! \nShe looks around the train yard outside & cannot\
  \ see a soul. \nSo this will be my end. \nThis is how I will go.\nStuck in a stuffy\
  \ old train carriage with not a soul in the world aware of my awesome last journey.\
  \ My amazing adventure that I didnt even get to tell anyone about. \nBut I guess\
  \ there are worse ways to go than travelling the world?\nAs she\u2019s about to\
  \ give in to her resolve, she sees a tall, middle aged man amble down the side of\
  \ the train, apparently checking something on it\u2019s exterior. \nShe leaps to\
  \ attention & BANG BANG BANGS on the window furiously! Nothing. \nA little louder\
  \ this time & shes shouting \u2018Helloo!?\u2019\nThe man is startled & looks up\
  \ at the window. He\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s seeing, but he snaps to attention\
  \ & races to the carriage\u2019s outer exit door, unlocking it with a bunch of heavy\
  \ keys. \n\u2018You shouldnt be on here!\u2019 He scolds. Obviously he\u2019s aware\
  \ that she speaks English from her screaming inside the train. \nShe bursts out\
  \ in tears, thankful to the handsome man for saving her life (possibly). \nHis angry\
  \ eyes quickly turn to concerned, kind eyes when he realises she\u2019s no trouble-maker,\
  \ just a silly foreigner in need of a kind stranger to escort her out of a quandry.\
  \ \nHe takes her hand & helps her down from the train & leads her through the yard\
  \ to the platform where she embarked on her brief, confused (& confusing) journey\
  \ to nowhere. \n\u2018Don\u2019t worry. It happens all the time!\u2019 He kindly\
  \ quips in his strong Italian accent, as she stands there feeling a complete fool\
  \ in front of this handsome older man. \n\u2018To make you feel ok, I lunch you?\u2019\
  \n\u2018Ok. If you\u2019ll let me buy\u2019...she blushes\nAnd they lived happily\
  \ ever after.."
