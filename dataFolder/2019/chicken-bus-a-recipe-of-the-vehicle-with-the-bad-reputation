Text: "It is probably possible to write a whole poem about the chicken buses. So much\
  \ fame they have: both positive and negative. Some travelers love them; some travelers\
  \ are terrified by them and avoid them as much as possible. I belong to the first\
  \ group, though I was a little bit nervous getting on my first chicken bus in Guatemala.\
  \ But like with any \u201Cfirst time\u201D, if it goes smoothly, the excitement\
  \ to do it again and again is hard to conquer. Hence, I traveled through El Salvador,\
  \ Honduras and Nicaragua without using a shuttle bus even a single time. Only the\
  \ chicken buses! Is it really so dangerous?\n\u2800Well, I can\u2019t deny that\
  \ sometimes chicken buses are being attacked by the gangs. However, it used to happen\
  \ much more often ten years ago than now, and the chance to be attacked being on\
  \ a touristic shuttle bus was actually even higher. I had a chance to talk to the\
  \ former shuttle-bus driver from El Salvador, and he told me that only a decade\
  \ ago, the tourists on the shuttles were robbed on a regular basis! Not anymore\
  \ though. Based on my experience, I got to the conclusion that the chance to be\
  \ attacked by a gang being on a chicken bus is pretty low. The chance to be robbed\
  \ - same like the chance to be robbed in New York or any other city on the world.\
  \ Just watch your bag no matter where you are!\n\u2800It is true: I saw a lot accidents\
  \ on the roads traveling through the Central America. Some of the drivers go really\
  \ fast \u2013 you cannot deny it. Still, I believe this is just the way how many\
  \ people drive there, regardless of what type of the vehicle they drive: a chicken\
  \ bus or a BMW. In such wise, unfortunately I do not think you lower the chance\
  \ of accident going on a shuttle bus instead of a chicken bus. \n\u2800 Another\
  \ \u201Cterrifying fact\u201D about riding a chicken bus is sexual harassment that\
  \ is a \u201Ccommon thing\u201D happening to the female travelers. I did read some\
  \ stories, and I watched some vlogs about how girls where sexually assaulted on\
  \ the chicken buses. Well...isn\u2019t it happening almost anywhere in the world?\
  \ You might be a target being a solo female traveler in Central America. Or Spain.\
  \ Or Great Britain. I travelled solo for more than three months in the region and\
  \ never have experienced any tricky situations.\n\u2800As you see, I don\u2019t\
  \ think there\u2019s a reason to be terrified by the chicken buses! They are a little\
  \ bit slower than the shuttle buses of course (I would say you arrive to a destination\
  \ 1,5 - 2 hours later.), but they are 3-4 times cheaper! And getting from one bus\
  \ to another is super easy: the bus workers will carry your luggage and will transfer\
  \ you to another bus almost holding your hand!\n\u2800Finally, the last thing. Chicken\
  \ buses are like the subway in NYC. They are life of the country, and it\u2019s\
  \ blood it\u2019s vivid energy! Go on a chicken bus if you want to get to know locals,\
  \ to see what they eat, what they talk about, what they laugh about, how they dress,\
  \ and what is in their eyes after a long day working on a field\u2026"
