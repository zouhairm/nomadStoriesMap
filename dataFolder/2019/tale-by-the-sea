Text: "It was a cloudy afternoon when I arrived at the picturesque dalmatian coast\
  \ of Dubrovnik. The air felt heavy, moisture-laden with a hint of an upcoming downpour.\
  \ Though I missed the sunny warmth, nevertheless I dumped my bag at the Airbnb overlooking\
  \ the sea and without wasting a minute  I prepared myself to explore the new place.\
  \ As I walked down the hilly crisscrossed path leading to the walled town below,\
  \ it had already started drizzling. The dark grey clouds enveloped the sky and the\
  \ otherwise blue sea looked a shade of emerald from that distance. When I finally\
  \ reached the old town, the streets were almost empty except for that occasional\
  \ passerby hurrying for shelter against the sheets of downpour which was now increasing\
  \ by the second. Half drenched with the umbrella not helping much, I walked briskly\
  \ through the passageway leading out of the fortress to the sea. Coming to the opening\
  \ at the end of the town walls I stood there for a while, mesmerized and transfixed,\
  \ my heart thumping excitedly at the sight of the sea! It is a feeling which always\
  \ failed any expression,  although it is that familiar flutter of exhilaration every\
  \ time I am by the sea.  I walked ahead and climbed up a concrete platform to watch\
  \ the waves lashing out (as if in fury). It is my first time to have encountered\
  \ these high waves from such close quarters. I looked around and noticed a lone\
  \ iron bench on one side, rusty with salty water. Maybe on brilliantly sunny days,\
  \ it serves as a strategic position for a love-pair to sit there holding hands and\
  \ staring out at the sea with dreamy eyes, whispering sweet nothings! Suddenly I\
  \ was engulfed by a deep sense of loneliness. I walked slowly up to the wet seat\
  \ and sat there still holding my umbrella. Through the heavy rain, my eyes were\
  \ fixed at the high waves once again. I noticed a movement through the corner of\
  \ my eye and realized I was not alone here after all! A cat with black and white\
  \ coat jumped onto the bench beside me, nonchalant of my presence, made itself comfortable,\
  \ oblivious of the downpour, its eyes fixed at the waves in front. Although it took\
  \ me by surprise, I was pleasantly fascinated by the audacity of the little wet\
  \ feline. I slowly eased out towards it but stopped close, not touching only sharing\
  \ the umbrella. It did not move! We sat there together, under my umbrella appreciating\
  \ the silent companionship of the moment and watching the waves fall and rise as\
  \ if the world outside doesn\u2019t matter. Then I started speaking, softly, don\u2019\
  t remember what! maybe about my love for the sea or my fear for storms and the unpredictabilities\
  \ of life. My friend seemed to be taking in everything like a good listener would,\
  \ with mute attention and infrequent purry affirmations.  It\u2018s true that sometimes\
  \ you don\u2019t need to speak or understand the same language to bond with another\
  \ being, be it human or a cat. And by its all-knowing glance that scanned the sea\
  \ and the ease with which it held itself with a stranger,  it seemed to say that\
  \ unlike me this is not its first introduction with such turbulence in life and,\
  \ the sea \u201Edoes\u201C behave unruly sometimes! Time stood still. Then breaking\
  \ my reverie the kitty moved and stretched itself and I realized that the rain had\
  \ stopped with the moon shining up bright in the sky. The sea too had calmed down\
  \ with only a calm breeze blowing. With one last look at me my furry comrade moved\
  \ away and as I gazed after him he disappeared behind the rocks. I sat up straight\
  \ and rewinded the memory of the past moments shared with my unexpected companion,\
  \ my heart inundated with happiness. I had always cherished an image on a new year\
  \ greeting card I had once received as a child. It had a sketch of a wavy-haired\
  \ girl and a cat sitting together on a bench sharing an umbrella in the rain, overlooking\
  \ a stormy sea. Such a serene picture- I had thought then!"
