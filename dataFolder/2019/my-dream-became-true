Text: "Once i was reading article in my local news paper written by a writer \"Khushnood\
  \ Ali Khan\" that he visited a Wadi Al-Baida, also called \"Wadi Al-Jinn\", is a\
  \ mysterious valley where cars move without drivers touching them. The valley is\
  \ situated some 30 km northwest of Madinah. It draws the attention of thousands\
  \ of locals and visitors from around the Kingdom and abroad. Many city dwellers\
  \ travel to this natural park and erect tents for a few days, especially during\
  \ the weekend.Traditionalists believe the power of jinn is present in Wadi Al-Jinn.\
  \ Among the many peculiar stories about this valley are those about vehicles moving\
  \ upward in the mountainous roads, without any need to push the accelerator. Even\
  \ when the driver would switch off the engine, the car would move. Many people related\
  \ this to the power of jinns in the valley but it is also claimed that the mountains\
  \ in this region have some special type of magnetic powers.\nMy curiosity made me\
  \ go and explore the valley, after hearing the unusual stories. It is a beautiful\
  \ place, with trees surrounded by mountains, no houses or signs of any city or village.\n\
  We parked the car in neutral gear and to our amazement the car was moving slowly,\
  \ even though the engine was switched off. First we thought the road must be sloped,\
  \ but it wasn\u2019t. In fact the car was moving upward on its own. After a while,\
  \ the speed of the car increased.\nWe learned later that the mountains in the surrounding\
  \ area have magnetic qualities, which attract cars. Any iron object with wheels\
  \ will move on its own.\nGeological experts point out that this phenomenon, known\
  \ as reverse gravity, is also evident in other regions in the Kingdom, including\
  \ the southern regions of Asir and Najran. It is regarded as a natural phenomenon\
  \ taking place usually in some rocky mountainous regions.\nLocals who have stayed\
  \ in the valley at night said they had heard voices asking them to leave. \u201C\
  You don\u2019t belong here. This is our place,\u201D they claimed the voices had\
  \ told them.\n\"I have been hearing about the place for the past 3-4 years from\
  \ all the UMRAH visitors. I myself visited the place on my recent Hajj visit. The\
  \ car goes to the end of the long 6 km road where the actual drama begins from a\
  \ roundabout. The car was in neutral gear and the car moved from 0 to 140 kn/hr.\
  \ YES !! YES!! 140 km/hr..... \nOur guide in Madina took us to WADI E JINN. . He\
  \ showed us that after a certain point of entering the place which was surrounded\
  \ by pointed mountain, the things were repelled in the direction out of the Wadi.\
  \ He put the car in neutral after that point and shut down the engine. the car kept\
  \ on moving backwards and in a few minutes started picking up speed even though\
  \ we were going upwards !!same happened when the threw some water on the road. the\
  \ water started flowing upwards towards the direction point out of the wadi.. they\
  \ say the jinns are protecting the place from dajjal the one eye monster who is\
  \ suppose to enter Madina and attack Muslims.\nSomehow this valley has gained holy\
  \ or magical importance which is not real. Yes, the vehicles and things move against\
  \ the pull of gravity here but it is merely due to the topography of the area that\
  \ the pull of gravity is reversed. However, some people have associated this phenomenon\
  \ with Jinns and other beliefs etc.Any how this traveling was very nice i experienced\
  \ all that i read and heard from so many visitors."
