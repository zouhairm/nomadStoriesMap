Text: "since the ancient time portugal people were famous as tough sailors, portugal\
  \ sailors have visited almost the entire world. surely they also bring cultures\
  \ from their countries to other countries they visited, first in this review of\
  \ the trip I will convey the influence in terms of the food they provide to other\
  \ countries, the second I will share my experience  when I visited portugal, For\
  \ example the food influence from portugese people is Japan with Tempura, India\
  \ with Vindaloo, Brazil with Fejioda, and also with the macau egg tart . Also portugal\
  \ have a famous cold fish dish typical portugal food in the form of traditional\
  \ food made from sea fish. Generally these foods are usually served during the holiday\
  \ season, during the summer, fish are usually easily available on the market. Fish\
  \ will be cooked with a lot of oil.\n\nAfter cooking, the dish will be served with\
  \ potatoes. Coldfish dishes will taste savory because they are also served with\
  \ spices such as red shrimp, garlic, and using olive oil, making this dish have\
  \ a special aroma.\n\nThis typical Portuguese cuisine is easily found in several\
  \ portugese restaurant, if you speak about a main dish you must not forget about\
  \ the dessert, at here I will talk about bolo rei do you hear a dish with this unique\
  \ name? every Portuguese must immediately realize, this unique dish is always synonymous\
  \ with the sea. Yup, dishes that might be considered like seafood are heavy-duty\
  \ seafood lovers.\n\nPortuguese people like to make snacks or typical snacks from\
  \ seafood, not much different from coastal people in Indonesia actually, but the\
  \ different processing methods clearly make typical Portuguese food have special\
  \ value.\n\nBolo Rei, known as the King Cake in England, is a traditional cake from\
  \ Portugal which is said to have to be on Christmas Eve. Bolo Rei is a soft white\
  \ dough filled with raisins, some also like to add peanuts and crystal fruit. The\
  \ appearance of this cake is quite unique, like donuts in my motherland Indonesia,\
  \ the difference is, this cake will be decorated like a king's crown. Therefore\
  \ in England this cake is called the king's cake. \n\nBefore when I worked at cruise\
  \ ship I had visited portugal for many times, like madeira , and lisbon. If we speak\
  \ about a portugal we can't forget about the mega star of football  from portugal,\
  \ Cristiano ronaldo. When I visited madeira cristiano ronaldo hometown, I had visited\
  \ the museum before. At madeira cristiano ronaldo museum are near at the port of\
  \ the cruise ship, on the front of the museum you can see ronaldo controversial\
  \ statue the one people say it ugly and not like the real cristiano ronaldo pyhsically.\
  \ \nHis statue was also a victim of vandalism by Ronaldo haters. Inside of ronaldo\
  \ museum is very amazing, people can see all the achievement from ronaldo throught\
  \ his career. They cost you only 5 euro for the entrance ticket. From the museum\
  \ of cristiano ronaldo you can walk straight to the center of the city, you will\
  \ see the beautiful of madeira with its location bordering on the seafront, the\
  \ local people and touris usually do a water sport like kano, jet ski, flying boat,\
  \ also a yacht.\n\nOf course not only that you can found at madeira. You can go\
  \ to local market and buy a souvenir for your family and friend. \n\nLisbon, city\
  \ that has a nickname \"the birthplace of portugal\" filled with a ancient building\
  \ like the 10th - century building. Castle of Guimaraes, medieval churches, and\
  \ archeological from the iron ages. \n\nLisbon also it\u2019s home to one of the\
  \ world\u2019s most top secret recipes, only three person in the world know the\
  \ original recipe of Past\xE9is da nata (portugese custard tart).\n\nWhen I visited\
  \ lisbon for the first time I got amazed with the architecture of this city, the\
  \ old classic tram, and the food experience is worth to visit. \n\nYou can spend\
  \ time on costa da caprica beach for free and wander around the historic place like\
  \ alfama.  \n\nIn the sunday morning many of museums , and monuments are free. For\
  \ the bonus you can listen to the live jazz performance in the jardim da estrela."
