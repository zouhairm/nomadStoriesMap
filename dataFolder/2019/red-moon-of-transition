Text: "It was the last night after our campfire \u2013 the girls were praying, some\
  \ even crying, on the floor of the wooden shack in the middle of the night. It was\
  \ one of my first night duties at the outdoor education centre, where I was supposed\
  \ to guard the group not staying up all night, nor leaving their dorms. I was having\
  \ coffee with Ernst and although I was tired in those nights, especially because\
  \ I\u2019d be working again at 7am, I enjoyed sitting there on the floor with him\
  \ talking. He was a local, he was born closeby and he was connected to this land\
  \ more than I could \u2018ve ever dreamed of. Since he had been part of the school\
  \ for some years, he had lots of knowledge of the stars and he would name their\
  \ constellations for me. It was fascinating - this opportunity to look at the sky\
  \ so clearly \u2013 there were almost no artificial lights and the stars lit up\
  \ the darkness of the endless flat. I have spent my whole previous life in a big\
  \ city more than 8654.40 km away and I\u2019d always dreamed of leaving, so I could\
  \ go somewhere remote to see life from a different perspective.\n South Africa,\
  \ with its 11 official languages, offered a variety of perspectives to me. Ernst\
  \ was Afrikaans. Before arriving, I believed his culture to be quite similar to\
  \ my Austrian heritage, but I soon realized that this wasn\u2019t the case. The\
  \ area where the school was located was called the Freestate. It\u2019s right in\
  \ the middle of South Africa, a region that was mostly inhabited by Afrikaans, and\
  \ Sotho, but since I was a white European I never had any contact with black people\
  \ apart from work. When Ernst explained me the origins of that name I was shocked:\
  \ \u201CThe Freestate wanted to remain \u201Cfree\u201D in a sense that its locals\
  \ wanted to keep the freedom of choosing in favour of the Apartheid system after\
  \ it had been abolished.\u201D\n\nWhy would anyone want to keep this system? I just\
  \ couldn\u2019t let go. In fact, thinking about it made me uncomfortable and I,\
  \ as stranger in this country, got a sense of not being welcome. It happened to\
  \ us some night ago that we went to a bar to play some billiard. It was a small\
  \ bar, but probably one of the biggest in town, and it reminded me of an Irish pub.\
  \ There were only white people in the bar \u2013 Afrikaans and some English. When\
  \ a black man entered, everyone stopped \u2013 no one was drinking anymore, the\
  \ conversations immediately silenced. Almost like there was this collective agreement\
  \ in the air where everyone was supposed to stare at the new arrival. The barman\
  \ then walked towards the door and asked the black man to leave. After he had left,\
  \ the bar became lively again and the moment passed as if nothing had ever happened.\
  \ Ernst was my only friend at the school, because somehow, he gave me the impression\
  \ of being more tolerant and welcoming than the others. And still, he couldn\u2019\
  t answer my questions either. There were separate bars and churches for whites and\
  \ blacks, but we had various school classes at the camp of different ethnical backgrounds;\
  \ Xhosa and Zulu mostly. The school class we were watching on that night was Zulu.\
  \ \nWhen I entered the barrack, I expected the girls to maybe talk or giggle like\
  \ we used to do during school camps back home, but instead I found them gathered\
  \ on the floor \u2013 some praying, some crying. I was really confused. One of the\
  \ girls noticed my perplexity. She said:\u201D Haven\u2019t you seen the red moon\
  \ tonight at the campfire? In our culture this might be a bad omen. So, we are praying.\
  \ Do you want to pray with us?\u201D I stopped praying when I was a child, so I\
  \ didn\u2019t join them, nonetheless I didn\u2019t stop their gathering. My duty\
  \ was teaching me to watch the moon from a different perspective that night and\
  \ I embraced this new knowledge. The next morning, we all woke up well, the world\
  \ didn\u2019t end, and we were the same- well, almost\u2026something inside me changed."
