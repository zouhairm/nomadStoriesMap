Text: "On August 29th, 2005, I tried, unsuccessfully, to imagine how I\u2019d decide\
  \ which few belongings I would stuff into my backpack and which I\u2019d sacrifice,\
  \ if I were forced to evacuate immediately.\n\n\nFor it was on that night that Katrina,\
  \ a powerful category 5 hurricane slammed the gulf coast transforming the once vivacious\
  \ New Orleans into what looked like a war zone.  Hundreds of thousands of people\
  \ were left homeless, their businesses destroyed, their families uprooted.   In\
  \ total the city suffered upwards of $100 billion in damages, but more importantly\
  \ are the 1,800 lives lost.\n\n\nAt the time I was 658 miles away from the submerged\
  \ city, but my friends were there\u2013 they were saying goodbye to their parents\
  \ to live on their own for the first time, only 3 days before disaster struck. \
  \ Dubbed the \u2018Katrina Class\u2019 they were forced to scatter to new schools\
  \ across the US with only their photographs to remind them of their short stay in\
  \ Louisiana; photos they took but could never bring themselves to look at.\n\n\n\
  \nSix years later, almost to the day, on a balmy August morning, I flew into Louis\
  \ Armstrong New Orleans International Airport.  I expected the passing of time to\
  \ wash away the mass destruction that was the aftermath of Katrina.  I was embarking\
  \ on a food and sightseeing tour and while worried that the rich history of the\
  \ swamplands might not be what it was prior to the storm, I assumed all was well.\
  \  I was not prepared for what I found.\n\n\nA local guide with sunken in eyes and\
  \ a weary smile walked my friend and I through cemeteries littered with trash and\
  \ overturned tomb stones from Katrina\u2019s strong winds.  We walked along the\
  \ streets hearing story after story of the devastation, noting the water lines that\
  \ were still visible on buildings and bars.  Imagining the terror as the city flooded\
  \ with 6- 10 feet of water, army tanks around every corner.  An entire city barren\
  \ and desperate for relief.\n\n\nOur guide brought us into an authentic restaurant\
  \ for a much needed escaped from the relentless August sun.  Sipping on the city\u2019\
  s signature frozen slushy concoction known ironically as, a Hurricane, he explained\
  \ how he didn\u2019t have the resources to leave his home in such a short amount\
  \ of time, or perhaps he just didn\u2019t have the heart to.\n\n\nAs 100 mile per\
  \ hour gusts of wind knocked down telephone poles and trees the situation became\
  \ dire.  He, along with 10,000 other locals who also ignored the overnight mandatory\
  \ evacuation order, were shuffled off to the Superdome for safety.  That is until\
  \ that structure suffered under the wrath of Katrina.  Forced to flee, he stayed\
  \ with a cousin up in the Carolinas, unable to return for almost a year.  The New\
  \ Orleans he came back to, wasn\u2019t the same one he left though.\n\n\nThe stark\
  \ difference between the atmosphere inside; freshly painted red brick walls, rustic\
  \ tables filled with smiling visitors, and live music and the tattered streets and\
  \ destroyed buildings outside, didn\u2019t go unnoticed.  We enjoyed silky oysters\
  \ on a bed of salt, Po\u2019boy sandwiches with a spicy Cajun flare that needed\
  \ multiple paper napkins to catch the drippings, a mixture of sauce and grease,\
  \ and signature beignets covered in mounds of powdered sugar.  As the trombone player\
  \ held his last note, my friend exchanged glances. It felt almost wrong to indulge\
  \ in the rich flavors and boisterous melodies as the conversation turned to the\
  \ people whose lives were taken.  The poor and elderly, the people unable to evacuate\
  \ due to lack of transportation or means.\n\n\nSix years and New Orleans is still\
  \ plagued by the ghost of Katrina, the hurricane that\u2019s woven itself into the\
  \ very DNA of the small city.  It\u2019s left its footprint in every courtyard,\
  \ on every home and on the lives of so many.  That is if you care enough to hear\
  \ the stories of the residents who lived through it or notice the discolored bricks\
  \ that showed how high the water rose and streetlights that appear a little dimmer,\
  \ at least to me."
