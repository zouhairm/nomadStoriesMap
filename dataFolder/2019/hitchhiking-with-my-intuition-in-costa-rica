Text: "THUMB OUT to the road it\u2019s time for an adventure. \u201CWill I get raped?\u201D\
  \ It\u2019s a damp day on the Caribbean coast of the Costa Rican jungle. The bus\
  \ I'm waiting on never shows so I decide to hitch a ride. It\u2019s my first day\
  \ off from my random hostel job and I think about the fact that country after country\
  \ none of the other travelers look like me. \u201CI am a traveling Black Queen,\u201D\
  \ I tell myself. \u201CI am an anomaly in motion.\u201D\n\nTo travel as a Black\
  \ Woman is an exercise in fluidity; an exercise in how much you can challenge your\
  \ mental conditioning and perceived inferiority;  an exercise in how much you are\
  \ willing and able to trust your intuition. I have a flashback to a meditation I\
  \ practiced the night before on Uranus, the planet of spontaneity - I decide to\
  \ let her be my guide today.\n\nA car slows to a stop in front of me. I look in\
  \ and see two young guys\u200A. \u200AThe passenger has smiling eyes, shoulder length\
  \ hair, and gauges in his ears.\n\n\u201CWhere are you going?\u201D He asks me.\n\
  \nFeeling poetic, I respond, \u201CTo the end of the road.\u201D\n\nThere\u2019\
  s only one road that runs the Caribbean coast so he smiles knowingly and responds,\
  \ \u201CTo Manzanillo?\u201D\n\nI say \u201CSi.\u201D He says \u201CSi.\u201D\n\n\
  The vibe feels Irie so I hop in the backseat with my trust in Spirit.\n\nIn the\
  \ car, I briefly start to question if I made the right decision but before I have\
  \ the chance to go into a mental downward spiral the brown cutie with gauges whose\
  \ name turns out to be Luis asks me if I have any papers to roll the Ganja. I laugh\
  \ and tell him I forgot mine. He laughs with me as he grabs a big bag of shaggy\
  \ herb from under the seat. \u201CAyeee, I chose some weedheads?!\u201D These guys\
  \ aren't murderers! Intuition check\u200A\u2014\u200Aconfirmed.\n\n\u201CGood vibrations,\u201D\
  \ I say to no one in particular. Luis smiles with a nod. We are here.\n\nI step\
  \ out of the car and take Manzanillo in\u200A\u2014\u200Athe crashing waves, the\
  \ kids playing, and the black and brown sand that somehow seems to mimic the pigment\
  \ of the locals I see hanging out in front of the seaside bars and stores. This\
  \ place is vibrant\u200A\u2014\u200Aantique and decrepit yet pulsating with life.\
  \ Luis passes the joint.\n\n\u201CYou want to go to the lookout point then go for\
  \ a swim? It\u2019s about a 30 minute drive. \u201D I hear Luis ask me.\n\nI hit\
  \ the joint, shake my nerves, and calmly respond, \u201CSure.\u201D\n\nWe're back\
  \ to driving through the jungle now better acquainted and barefoot, sippin\u2019\
  \ on some light liquor from Panama called Tamborito, which goes down surprisingly\
  \ smooth.\n\nPunta Uva literally means Point Grape in English. Maybe because it\
  \ looks like a grapevine. Luis looks back at us and says, \u201CLet\u2019s go up\
  \ to the point.\u201D No more intuition checks.\u201CLet\u2019s go UP!\u201D\n\n\
  Tipsy and still a lil high, we begin our trek through the jungle. Our feet gush\
  \ in the mud as we climb and reach for branches to stop us from falling. We slip\
  \ and laugh and grab each other\u2019s hands when we\u2019re about to bust our asses.\
  \ Luis does a little double squeeze every time he grabs mine. I giggle but then\
  \ go back to focusing on the ascent.\n\nWe reach Punta Uva and I am breathless.\
  \ It feels like we are in the middle of the ocean. We can see the surfers trying\
  \ to catch the massive waves to our left, but straight ahead it\u2019s nothing but\
  \ deep blue. It\u2019s absolutely beautiful. I chill and meditate while Luis and\
  \ Kevin relax on the grass.\n\nAfter some easy conversation, we take a last shot\
  \ of Tamborito to shake our nerves before making our way back down. When we get\
  \ back to beach, we peel off our sticky clothes and run our muddy bodies into the\
  \ warm caribbean waters. Luis and I go in deeper and splash and float and play like\
  \ kids. We talk about souls and spirits. \n\nBefore I know it, it\u2019s dark and\
  \ we're still enjoying the vibes. I\u2019m vibrating like drums. Intuition Confirmed."
