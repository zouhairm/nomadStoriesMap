Text: "Santi and I usually plan our trips long ahead of time. In January though, he\
  \ suddenly wrote me during work saying that he wanted to visit our friends in Donostia.\
  \ Within ten minutes I had selected flights and a few days later the entire trip\
  \ was booked. It was going to be Bilbao, Donostia and finally Santander, so that\
  \ we would get to see something more in Spain. \nWe left Cork - where we live -\
  \ on a stormy January day and took a bus up to Dublin from where we would get direct\
  \ flights to Cantabria. I squeezed in a visit to the Chinese embassy to pick up\
  \ my visa for our March trip through Asia while Santi had a coffee in our favorite\
  \ spot by the Liffey river.\nThe flight itself was shaky and when we arrived to\
  \ Santander it was pouring outside. \nOur bus wasn\u2019t due for an hour and a\
  \ half, so we had yet another round of coffee and surprisingly good croquettes with\
  \ ham filling. \nMore rain awaited us during the good hour we spent on the bus to\
  \ Bilbao where we grabbed our suitcase and walked to our hotel. The route picked\
  \ by my phone was impressive. Santi, usually quite badass when it came to dark alleyways\
  \ and possibly dangerous streets, was the one finally steering us off the marked\
  \ trail and onto a livelier street. \nIn the old quarter of the city we walked by\
  \ bars with displays full of pinchos and wine glasses behind the bars. The entrance\
  \ to our hotel was conveniently located next to a guy who seemed to be selling drugs.\
  \ We entered the building quickly and made sure the door closed behind us before\
  \ walking up a gigantic staircase and checking ourselves in. \nI felt hungry and\
  \ within fifteen minutes Santi was ready to have dinner at a Mexican place because\
  \ why not. He was taking antibiotics and I felt sorry for having a margarita but\
  \ nonetheless I had it. \nSanti picked an array of Mexican dishes he considered\
  \ typical enough. \n\nThe next morning began with rain and since the outlook for\
  \ the remainder of our stay did not look any better we spent the morning in the\
  \ local Decathlon shopping for rainproof jackets and shoes. We weren\u2019t quite\
  \ sure how we would fit the additional baggage into our luggage but the desire to\
  \ stay dry was stronger. \n\nNext up was the Guggenheim. 16\u20AC per person would\
  \ have put us off on a sunny day but we gladly paid for a change of scenery. \n\n\
  For dinner I had picked a pincho place from Michelin\u2019s cheap eats list and\
  \ afterwards we ate more when we found a bar serving Basque cake. \n\nAfter checking\
  \ out on the next morning the bus took us to Donostia. It was raining there as well.\
  \ Our little inn looked perfect and comfortable but Santi felt like walking to the\
  \ coast for even more water. \n\nTo spend a bit less, dinner was cheeseburgers and\
  \ a Fanta at McDonald\u2019s. \n\nTo our surprise the next day was sunny and warmer.\
  \ The inn kept our luggage and we took another stroll to the beach, shared Basque\
  \ cake and got some souvenirs.\n\nThe bus then took us to Santander. Santi was stunned\
  \ at our posh looking hotel. I had found a deal on the internet and felt proud of\
  \ myself. \n\nThe promenade took us by caf\xE9s and a brand new museum while on\
  \ the opposite side of the water there was a beautiful mountainous backdrop. \n\
  Santi picked a Peruvian restaurant for the night and we ate ceviche accompanied\
  \ by Pisco Sour. \nSanti has stopped caring about his antibiotics by now and allowed\
  \ himself a drink for each dinner. \n\nThe final day was as rainy as ever. We shared\
  \ breakfast close to our hotel and went to an archeological museum before catching\
  \ the bus to the airport.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t raining in Ireland as we arrived."
