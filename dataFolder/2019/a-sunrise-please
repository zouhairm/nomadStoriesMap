Text: "I was driving through the darkness along a quiet, lonely highway, too early,\
  \ at a time when others would be asleep. I had left the camping area in the forest\
  \ near Coopernook only a few hours ago. I had arrived that late I didn't have enough\
  \ light to set up my tent, so I resigned myself to sleeping rather unsuccessfully\
  \ in the car. That was why I decided to continue the journey. 4:30am. Tired again\
  \ and I needed to stop.\n\nI had passed Port Macquarie already and I was lamenting\
  \ the idea of stopping by the side of the road without a cup of coffee in sight.\
  \ There was a vivid vision that arouse within my mind - Sunrise. Yes, this is exactly\
  \ what I wanted to do. In the night, everything looks the same. Where could I find\
  \ the coast? It had to be on the right; where else would the coast be while travelling\
  \ north? The map would know. Squinting at the brightness of the phone, I was the\
  \ dot. What's the next turn that will take me to my goal? Kempsey just happened\
  \ to be 15 minutes away. And a road that looked like it lead to a beach - Crescent\
  \ Head. \n\nAfter driving through more darkness, the veil begins to lift. The chill\
  \ of the morning permeates through the windows, \"That's alright!\" I tell myself.\
  \ \"The sun will be with us soon\". The dawn arrives and with it's vivifying inspiration\
  \ so do the creatures of the day. Dolphins out in the water, birds rustling in the\
  \ trees. And of course, the plethora of people walking up and down the promenade.\
  \ From the comfort of my driver's seat, I could see it all. The reflection of the\
  \ sun on the water, the washing of waves over sand. Perfection! \n\nOne piece of\
  \ the puzzle was missing. One little item that makes the early morning bearable\
  \ - coffee. I'm not sure whether it was fate or just clever business placement,\
  \ but a beachside kiosk was opening meters away from where I was parked. What a\
  \ win. \n\nThe kiosk was owned by a lovely couple who had bought land north of the\
  \ beach and the kiosk was the way to pay it off. The best thing about travelling\
  \ is the people you meet, each with their own dreams, aspirations, wants and needs.\
  \ It is amazing what connections can arise from these seemingly random interactions."
