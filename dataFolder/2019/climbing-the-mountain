Text: "We hiked to the bottom of the steep mountain that appeared to be going straight\
  \ up. It was day two of my first backpacking trip and I doubted I could make it\
  \ to the top. What if I fall?\n    The mountain was covered in patches of dying\
  \ grass which just managed to hold onto a tint of light green. Other patches were\
  \ dark green and full of life. Then, placed in random spots, as though thrown by\
  \ children, lay a variety of rocks, ranging from pebbles to blocks the size of toaster\
  \ ovens.  \n    We were in Retezat National Park \u2013 a mountain rage in Romania,\
  \ a six-hour drive from the capital, Bucharest. I was studying abroad nearby in\
  \ the Jiu Valley, which is comprised of six small towns and a few villages with\
  \ the total population of less than one-hundred-twenty thousand. \n    There were\
  \ only two other students in the program and it was their first backpacking trip\
  \ as well. Intense hiking and carrying a fifty-pound backpack, was a challenge.\
  \ But the harder one was being a liberal Jew from California in a group of conservative\
  \ Christians from Iowa. My problems however, did not stem from religion, but from\
  \ the differences in the ways we were raised. I was brought up to be independent\
  \ and ask for what I wanted, and they were raised to do as they were told. \n  \
  \  Earlier that day, we had stopped for a break. Maya, one of the other two students,\
  \ was \u201Cleader of the day,\u201D which meant she got to pick the snack. She\
  \ chose homemade cliff bars, as they were heavy and she was carrying them. My stomach\
  \ was upset and cliff bars didn\u2019t appeal to me. Carter, the other student,\
  \ accepted Maya\u2019s choice without hesitation, though he had thrown up hours\
  \ before. But, when I asked for an apple \u2013 my craving that morning \u2013 the\
  \ answer a the loud, clear \u201Cno,\u201D from the semester supervisor. After all,\
  \ Maya was the leader of the day and her choice was irrevocable. \n    After that,\
  \ I pulled out my iPod, which I barely received permission to bring, and I let John\
  \ Denver serenade me with Annie\u2019s Song, which I played again when I started\
  \ to climb the mountain. \n    In order to counter the weight of my enormous backpack,\
  \ I leaned so far forward, I could have been searching for bugs in the grass. My\
  \ hands squeezed the grips of the hiking poles as I found a place to put my foot.\
  \ I was able to make my way up the lower part of the mountain, sometimes struggling\
  \ to find a safe place to step forward. This was supposed to be a backpacking trip\
  \ for beginners.  \n    My foot slipped, but I managed to right myself. I took another\
  \ step forward and screamed. The patch of dead grass that looked safe, hid a group\
  \ of loose stones. I tried to straighten up to regain balance, but the fifty pounds\
  \ on my back was pulling me towards the bottom of the mountain, where we had been\
  \ twenty minutes before. I felt a hand on my backpack. Carter was supporting me.\
  \  \n    \u201CThank you.\u201D You saved me.\n    He nodded.\n    I looked at the\
  \ ground, unsure where to step, then back at Carter. Help.\n    \u201CPut your foot\
  \ there.\u201D He motioned to a spot that was a little flatter. I did. \u201CNow\
  \ there,\u201D he pointed to another spot covered in dark green grass. I kept going\
  \ by myself. Up and up until I made it. I unclipped my backpack and let it fall\
  \ to the ground. Freedom.\n    I hadn\u2019t thought that I could climb this mountain,\
  \ but with Carter\u2019s help, I had. Maybe now I could begin a different climb,\
  \ another one that I wasn\u2019t sure if I could accomplish \u2013 making friends\
  \ with someone so different from me. This came without fear of falling, but with\
  \ risk the of being judged and ostracized by people who I didn\u2019t understand.\
  \ But Carter had supported me once, maybe he would do it again. \n    \u201CYou\
  \ did it,\u201D Carter said. And he smiled."
