Text: "Fahre came into my life unexpectedly. And in the end, was my most cherished\
  \ memory of Turkey.\n\nIt had, until then, been a mixed experience. My companion\
  \ had abandoned me to go do a trip on her own; I wasn\u2019t prepared for how cold\
  \ it turned out to be in Istanbul; the locals either turned my heart to mush with\
  \ their generosity or made me run for cover with their aggressive sociability. Especially,\
  \ the men in Istanbul. They confused me.\n\nDerya told me about them first. She\
  \ was not so much a guide, but a crash course of life as a woman in Istanbul.\n\n\
  I asked her what I am asked every day as a woman over the age of thirty: why wasn\u2019\
  t she married yet?\n\n\u201CI am 30. I have my share of men. A good job which pays.\
  \ I meet interesting people every day. Live and pay my rent in Istanbul. What can\
  \ marriage give me, which I don\u2019t already have?\u201D she answered.\n\n\u201C\
  Are women like that everywhere in Turkey, or just in Istanbul?\u201D I enquired.\n\
  \n\u201CWell, I am from Izmir, and women from Izmir are supposed to be extra-modern,\u201D\
  \ she laughed softly. A tinkle of warmth cut through the crisp winter air. \u201C\
  In fact, if you tell someone from Istanbul you are from Izmir, they turn up their\
  \ nose like this.\u201D She showed me.\n\nWe laughed together because I knew exactly\
  \ what she meant.\n\n\u201CHave you heard of the common saying in Istanbul?\u201D\
  \ she asked seriously then.\n\n\u201CNo, which one exactly?\u201D I asked. \n\n\u201C\
  If you are married to a man who works in Istanbul, there is a 50% chance he will\
  \ be unfaithful. If he works in Istanbul and is well traveled, there is a 75% chance\
  \ he will be unfaithful. If he works in Istanbul and is well traveled AND in tourism,\
  \ there is a 100% chance he will be unfaithful.\u201D\n\n\u201CSo\u2026\u201D I\
  \ prompted.\n\n\u201CSo, why marry? It is bound to end badly.\u201D\n\nThat and\
  \ many other small incidents made me wary of Turkish men.\n\nUntil I met Fahre.\n\
  \nIt happened on my last day in Istanbul. I had a nonrefundable flight to Sel\xE7\
  uk at 7 p.m. At 4 p.m. and still in the city, I was dangerously late.\n\nI stood\
  \ at Ey\xFCp waiting anxiously for a bus to arrive. I had to be back at my B&B in\
  \ Sultanahmet, pack up, and rush to catch my flight. I knew only one way to get\
  \ to Sultanahmet and that was via Emin\xF6n\xFC. I\u2019d already let one bus pass\
  \ me by, alarmed by how crowded it was. I needed another one to come soon.\n\nFahre\
  \ was standing at the bus stop with me. It was just the two of us. Red striped sweater.\
  \ Neatly combed hair. Narrow face. Easy smile. Good looking. I wondered if I should\
  \ strike a conversation. \n\nHe beat me to it.\n\n\u201CWhich bus are you waiting\
  \ for?\u201D he asked.\n\n\u201C99A to Emin\xF6n\xFC,\u201D I said. \u201CAnd you?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CI'm going to Sultanahmet,\u201D he replied.\n\nGodsend.\n\n\u201DMe too!\"\
  \ I replied, trying to keep the panic out of my voice. Act cool, I chastised myself.\n\
  \n\u201CAre you getting late?\u201D he asked. \"Do you have to be somewhere?\"\n\
  \nI nodded vigorously. Pathetically. \"I need to catch a flight. I\u2019ve been\
  \ waiting for the 99A for ages. One went by, but it was super crowded. I couldn't\
  \ get in. And now I don\u2019t know any other way to get back.\u201D\n\nHis face\
  \ lit up with an impish smile. \u201CThere\u2019s another way,\u201D he said conspiratorially.\
  \ \u201CTake the bus to Beyazit Square. Sultanahmet is close by. You can walk.\"\
  \n\nAfter ten minutes, the bus to Beyazit rumbled to a stop next to us. It was bursting\
  \ at its seams. I swallowed nervously. Fahre beckoned to me. \u201CI\u2019ll take\
  \ you.\u201D And so he did. Guiding me amidst the swilling crowd; persuading a man\
  \ to leave his seat for me with a stern glare; afterward guiding me down the bus\
  \ when our stop came.\n\nHe showed me the way to my B&B and made as if to leave.\n\
  \n\u201CWould you like a coffee?\u201D I asked, heart in my mouth.\n\nI never made\
  \ my flight. \n\nHe told me later it wasn\u2019t even his stop."
