Text: "If you are strapped for cash like me but love to travel to Southern Europe\
  \ it is a real struggle. Countries like Italy, Spain and France are notoriously\
  \ expensive for young, broke. Well I think I have found a cheap alternative.\n\n\
  Although, Vilnius is on pretty much the opposite side of the continent it somehow\
  \ manages to offer a very southern European feel. The architecture, weather and\
  \ society seemingly offer themselves more to the Southern European countries than\
  \ their Baltic counterparts. So, if you are looking at flights to the French Riviera\
  \ but see your overdraft looming, carry on reading and I will show you this cheap\
  \ alternative. \n\nThe first striking comparison I saw to Southern Europe, especially\
  \ Italy and Spain, happened as soon as I stepped off the bus, Vilnius looks Southern\
  \ European. The buildings are basic and more classically styled, completely white\
  \ and in places a little \u2018run down.\u2019 This is not intended as a criticism,\
  \ I love this style of architecture. Another thing that struck me was how similar\
  \ the public buses looked to those that I have rode on across Southern Europe. Again\
  \ they are more simple and stripped back and a great example of the more laid back\
  \ culture of countries like this. Going further into the centre of town the comparisons\
  \ get stronger and stronger. Lithuania is a Catholic country and as such follows\
  \ a very similar style of church building to countries like Italy and Spain. The\
  \ complex decoration and gold plated ornaments surround you at every turn in the\
  \ city centre much like they do in Rome and Barcelona.  So there you have it, if\
  \ the aesthetic of Southern Europe is what you are after Vilnius has got it.\n\n\
  Now you are probably thinking \u2018Matthew, you crusty Northerner, how can the\
  \ weather be anything like Southern Europe that much further North?\u2019 Yes I\
  \ know the weather is what we as Brits and many other countries flock to the Southern\
  \ European states for year after year, and yes Lithuania year round is not on the\
  \ same level as Italy and Spain in terms of heat. But, it is the Southernmost Baltic\
  \ country and when we were there in mid September, I am not going to lie it felt\
  \ boiling. At points it soared upto temperature of 26 degrees, but it definitely\
  \ felt hotter than that. I don\u2019t know why this was or if we were just very\
  \ lucky but having been to Barcelona earlier that summer, Vilnius felt hotter. \n\
  \nThe final comparison I wish to make, is between the societies. Personally my favourite\
  \ thing about countries like Italy and Spain is the way the people act on a day\
  \ to day basis. This attitudes also is apparent in Lithuania. Drinking tea, coffee\
  \ and great beer outside throughout the day in the sunlight allowing you to the\
  \ relax happens all over Vilnius. No one seems to have to get anywhere in too much\
  \ of a hurry, allowing you to walk the streets freely without fear of getting push,\
  \ shoved or crushed. Finally the outgoing and hospitable locals help you feel like\
  \ you belong and are not interfering with their day to day lives, once again allowing\
  \ you to chill out and just enjoy yourselves. All of these things were what I love\
  \ about the South of Europe and they are what I love about Vilnius.\n\nThat\u2019\
  s it! Now it must be said that to get the full Southern European feeling you have\
  \ to go to Southern Europe and I am framing Vilnius as a cheap alternative for those\
  \ of us who struggle to afford Spain and Italy. Some Baltic traditions obviously\
  \ have there place in Lithuanian society, mainly the food, so if you are going to\
  \ Southern Europe to get your fill of  Tapas, Pizza or Pasta, Vilnius is not what\
  \ you are looking for. But for the rest of us who go on holiday for the three reasons\
  \ discussed in this blog post I hope you check out Vilnius, not just for your fill\
  \ of Southern European culture on a budget, but also to try something a little different."
