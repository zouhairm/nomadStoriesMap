Text: "The region of Mount Elgon cares nothing of borders, with its peaks and valleys\
  \ dancing along the line where Uganda and Kenya shake hands. Dressed in a billowing\
  \ emerald green and the vibrant shades of summer\u2019s produce, the only reminiscence\
  \ of its long antiquated days of volcanic activity, comes in the form of clouds\
  \ coloured gun-metal gray during rainy season. From the summit of the mountains,\
  \ one can see the homes that dot the hillsides, connected by narrow footpaths that\
  \ run amid the fields of maize and by the hearts of those who inhabit them. Together\
  \ these families create a village, and their communities a tribe; but just like\
  \ a hard-to-see constellation, they remain unknown by the world\u2019s majority,\
  \ with the exception of those who look just long enough to see and never forget.\
  \ \n\tWithin the easternmost aspects of Ugandan territory, and the staggered bounds\
  \ of Mount Elgon, lies the unhurried district of Bududa. I travelled to the region\
  \ during the summer preceding my final year of undergraduate studies, as a developing\
  \ health professional eager to extend compassion to a world left wanting, and entirely\
  \ unsure how. Waking early to the sounds of discontent roosters and the gentle hum\
  \ of motorcycles already carrying passengers through the village streets, it took\
  \ little time to appreciate how drastically different the rhythms of life flow thousands\
  \ of miles from home. But as I recounted in my leatherbound journal by candlelight\
  \ at the end of each long day, the feelings of sorrow, of love, and of joy remain\
  \ relatively constant, even if the context and experiences that inform those sentiments\
  \ vary. \n\tRuben was one individual who exemplified a personality that stood in\
  \ contrast to the easygoing nature that seemed to characterize the village as a\
  \ whole. We met at the medical clinic where I was volunteering that summer, as he\
  \ there held the important position of outreach coordinator. Clad in a pristine\
  \ suit jacket everyday despite the insufferable heat that persisted until the arrival\
  \ of late afternoon rains, and with a smile that formed a wide crescent moon against\
  \ the brown pigment of his skin, Ruben put everything he had into his labour. I\
  \ was humbled to discover that not only was he a proud clinic staff member, but\
  \ also a loving father, a fervent pastor, and the compassionate owner of an elementary\
  \ school, which he opened as place of refuge and of learning for orphaned and vulnerable\
  \ children in the region. \n\tThe final weekend that I spent in Uganda, I chose\
  \ to stay within Bududa District, such that I would have an opportunity to visit\
  \ the local church where Ruben preached. In the weeks prior my volunteer team had\
  \ made excursions to Jinja to raft the perilous rapids of the River Nile, and to\
  \ Sipi, where we hiked amid beautiful cascading waterfalls. But this occasion was\
  \ quite different. While the majority ventured to Murchison, two of my friends and\
  \ I walked along a familiar road to where we met Ruben just a short distance from\
  \ the clinic. Straddling the back of a motorcycle far too small to carry all our\
  \ weight, we travelled to an anonymous church halfway up the mountain. Sitting on\
  \ the wooden pews beside village locals and clapping along to the sound of traditional\
  \ African drums, the interconnectedness of the paths we had travelled along began\
  \ to make more sense. They were hollowed by repeated visits between close neighbours,\
  \ because just as Ruben introduced us to his congregation, neighbours were meant\
  \ to be friends. \n\n** Name changed to protect personal privacy and security."
