Text: "It was an ominous sign, the flight attendant was working in an expedition style\
  \ Canada Goose jacket and not for the fashion. I was heading to colder temperatures,\
  \ much colder, a small hamlet called Pangnirtung that lies on the Canadian Arctic\
  \ Circle. This was to be a first for this Australian traveler as I was seeking something\
  \ different to the monotony of charming European cities and the plethora of beaches\
  \ that I had seen in my lifetime. I needed a travel challenge, something few people\
  \ experience and isn't set to blow up in the next Instagram trend. It needed to\
  \ be beyond that reach and do something that will put me out of my depth and here\
  \ I was about to find out just how out of my depth I will be.   \n\nThe pilot announces\
  \ that \u201CWe will be beginning our decent\u201D in that tone that suggests he\
  \ has done it a thousand times before. \u201CWe have clear skies and a temperature\
  \ of -32\xB0C\u201D, he adds.  \n\nI look out the window and see nothing but white\
  \ fluffy pillows. \u201CThat\u2019s strange\u201D, I commented. \u201CAll I see\
  \ is clouds\u201D. \n\n\u201CThat's the Arctic\u201D, a seasoned northern passenger\
  \ comments amused, as I clearly show my hand that this is indeed a first time for\
  \ me. It suddenly dawns on me more than ever that I am heading into a vast barren\
  \ land like some other planet, seemly void of any life and that includes trees.\
  \  \n\nI step off the plane and onto the tarmac in a rush for the terminal. It's\
  \ so cold it hurts to breathe, my fingers experience the onset of frostbite in a\
  \ matter of seconds. I\u2019m hungry  but the hotel restaurant is extortionately\
  \ expensive so I decide to venture out to the supermarket. $35 for ketchup, $13\
  \ for a cabbage? Maybe the hotel wasn\u2019t so expensive after all. \n\nWith no\
  \ activities planned and only a few hours of sunlight per day, it was a chance to\
  \ explore and go for a short walk beyond the community limits. I head outside and\
  \ it proves difficult to walk in winter boots so bulky they feel like they are designed\
  \ for astronauts and wearing more layers than an onion. A simple 30 min stroll feels\
  \ like a workout, so I reach the end of the road and decide to turn back. A pickup\
  \ truck pulls up beside me to check if I'm OK, it\u2019s a local Inuit man from\
  \ town who has a slight look of bewilderment in the fact that he knows that I am\
  \ out of my element. I tell him \u201CI\u2019m fine\u201D and the conversation quickly\
  \ turns to put me on alert.  \n\nSoftly spoken, he asks \u201CSee any polar bear\
  \ tracks?\u201D \n\nMy eyes widen with excitement at the thought that they could\
  \ be so close, but at the same time the reaction is from fear of what a risk I had\
  \ taken walking this far by myself.  \n\n\u201COne made his way through here only\
  \ a few days ago before he was spotted on the other side of the ice. I hope you\
  \ got your pistol handy\u201D he chuckled in an I'm not joking kind of tone, knowing\
  \ full well that I had come unprepared.  \n\nHis passenger, a younger Inuit man\
  \ speaks up to offer his advice, \u201CI wouldn\u2019t be out here without a pack\
  \ of dogs on your side, not at this time of year. They\u2019re hungry you know?\u201D\
  \ \n\nClearly, I wasn\u2019t travelling with a pack of huskies either and they knew\
  \ that too but with that nonchalant warning he was on his way and I was looking\
  \ over my shoulder. The day wasn\u2019t over though as tonight there would be a\
  \ performance of Mother Nature\u2019s finest work, the conditions for Aurora Borealis,\
  \ the northern lights, were just right. \n\nDespite spending enough money on winter\
  \ clothes to fund a week in Paris for two, I struggle to be outside. My beard was\
  \ now a giant icicle and my camera had literally frozen. I was officially out of\
  \ my depth, apparently just where I wanted to be and that felt great because the\
  \ rewards were tenfold. It was pure wilderness and not a single railing insight."
