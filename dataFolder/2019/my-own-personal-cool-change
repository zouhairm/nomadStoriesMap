Text: "In the neighborhood of Fitzroy North in the city of Melbourne on the continent\
  \ of Australia, the cafes close at 3:00 p.m. As an American freshly relocated from\
  \ New York City, the city that never sleeps, I hadn't foreseen this possibility.\
  \ To me, it seemed like Melbourne was the city that never awoke. I stood outside\
  \ the beautiful Victorian storefronts on Nicholson street, admiring the intricate\
  \ wrought iron adorning them and regretting the jet lag that had kept me from getting\
  \ to the caf\xE9 sooner. Inside, employees with charming accents finished wiping\
  \ tables, closing out cash registers and locking doors. \n\nDespite being less than\
  \ 20 minutes via tram from the Melbourne city center, Fitzroy North is a sleepy\
  \ little suburb. Parents of children and dogs alike mill about in Edinburgh Gardens\
  \ when the weather is nice. Cyclists whizz by on Canning street, exotic birds make\
  \ bizarre, guttural sounds from high up in the pale gum trees and trams glide back\
  \ and forth, ferrying people to and from the CBD. When dusk hits, the strange, exotic\
  \ birds increase their volume for some reason, like they're fighting to get the\
  \ last word in before the sun dips beneath the horizon. Then, suddenly, they all\
  \ go quiet and the air fills with living shadows. Thousands of fruit bats, called\
  \ Grey Headed Flying Foxes, leave their colony on the outskirts of the city at sunset\
  \ and take flight, their leathery wings silhouetted against the rapidly darkening\
  \ sky. \n\nVictoria, the Australian state Melbourne is contained within, is named\
  \ after England's second-longest reigning Queen. This province has a climate that\
  \ can swing from 110 degrees Fahrenheit to 60 in a matter of hours. When one of\
  \ these dramatic weather swings occurs, I like to picture the region as a tempestuous\
  \ old monarch whose unpredictable moods throw the whole state into meteorological\
  \ chaos. One minute it's sunny, bright and oppressively hot. Then the next minute\
  \ you're trapped in a downpour. When it rains in Melbourne, it feels like the whole\
  \ city is positioned beneath a raging waterfall. This type of intense weather swing,\
  \ like everything else in Australia, has a nickname. It's called a \"cool change.\"\
  \ I love that expression and find myself turning it over in my mouth, like a smooth\
  \ pebble, every time I see dark clouds moving rapidly across a clear sky.\n\nWhen\
  \ I spontaneously applied for an Australian visa and booked a flight from LaGuardia\
  \ to the Southern Hemisphere, I'd expected a lot of things. I hoped to be thrust\
  \ into a disorienting adventure that would rouse me from the fixed rhythm of my\
  \ life back in Brooklyn. But, despite the distance, the truth was that Melbourne\
  \ didn't feel all that alien to me. For one thing, Australians didn't find my accent\
  \ exotic or interesting, most of them having grown up on a steady diet of imported\
  \ American media. The culture shock I'd expected, hoped for, even, never came. Instead,\
  \ the cultural and social differences were subtle. To observe them, I had to force\
  \ myself to slow down, to be quiet, to listen. \n\nOver time, I began to notice\
  \ the different pace of life here. The studied politeness of people. The stars,\
  \ which seemed upside down to me here on the bottom half of the world. The metric\
  \ system. The food. The cars driving on the other side of the road. I learned how\
  \ to tell when a \"cool change\" was coming. I got used to the strange sounds wild\
  \ Cockatoos make, and to the heavy coins of Australian currency. Afterwards, American\
  \ change felt light and insubstantial to me, like play money. \n\nSlowly, my American\
  \ expectations dissipated into my newfound Australian tranquility, like milk foam\
  \ mixing with espresso to make a Flat White, the signature coffee drink of Melbourne,\
  \ which is best served on the patio of a caf\xE9 on Nicholson street, in Fitzroy\
  \ North, in the city of Melbourne, on the continent of Australia, any time before\
  \ 3:00 p.m."
