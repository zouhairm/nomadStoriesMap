Text: "\u201CShe has sickness of the heart,\u201D Mat\xEDas informed us in Spanish\
  \ as Robin and I tumbled around in the backseat of his bouncing pickup truck.\n\t\
  \u201CThe whole family\u2019s been up all night,\u201D he continued, \u201CPerforming\
  \ a ritual to help Ana.\u201D His voice was tinny. He seemed out of breath.  \n\t\
  \u201CAy, que terrible,\u201D Robin shouted over the rumble of gravel. Mat\xEDas\
  \ cast a forlorn glance into his rearview mirror and managed to muster up a smile\
  \ back at us.\nWe three chased the Trancur River down the mountain, under the ironically\
  \ cool shadow of Volcano Villarica. Soon, we reached a finca, or farm, in a small\
  \ southern Chilean town. Mat\xEDas\u2019s indigenous Mapuche family agreed to house\
  \ Robin and me and allow us to study their cultural tourism business in exchange\
  \ for labor in their herb garden \u2013 which Ana ran. \n\tMat\xEDas gave us a hand\
  \ as we hopped out of his truck onto lush, open land.\n\t\u201CScar,\u201D Robin\
  \ pointed to the lesion that connects Mat\xEDas\u2019s undereye to his upper lip,\
  \ as if to say, impressive. \n\t\u201CI fought a puma,\u201D he smirked. Later,\
  \ we found out over dinner with his family that he was not, in fact, joking.\n\n\
  I remember wondering, those days, how anyone\u2019s heart could fall ill when living\
  \ on acres of silent majesty. For such a small, raggedy pony, Paloma had no problem\
  \ trotting after me through the valley every morning on my way to work at the herb\
  \ farm, nipping at my elbows.\n\t\u201CPaloma, basta,\u201D I muttered, that was\
  \ enough.\n\tUp ahead and through the mist, Robin and I could make out the faint\
  \ figure of a man in a sun hat and blue jeans.\n\t\u201CHoooola,\u201D he called\
  \ out, waving. Then, a jovial belly laugh.\n\tWe jogged towards him, believing we\
  \ were late. He was hauling giant tin pales and clippers out from his shed.\n\t\u201C\
  My love Ana is unwell, so I will teach you. Jaime.\u201D\n\tHe shook our hands and\
  \ his smile plowed his wide cheeks so far up his face that he looked a lot like\
  \ the sun.\n\t\u201CAna is sick?\u201D Robin had been eager to meet this woman mastermind\
  \ of aromatherapy and small business.\n\t\u201CShe is sad.\u201D\n\tRobin and I\
  \ exchanged glances and understood. Just like Robin, Ana was depressed.\n\n\tFor\
  \ weeks, the three of us lost ourselves in a sort of busy bliss. Sometimes, Jaime\u2019\
  s young son Victor would help us. Jaime trained us to identify lavender, rosemary,\
  \ and eucalyptus, to boil the herbs and separate their oils to make bars of soap.\
  \ I got over my fear of bees as Jaime worked beside us with the hives, occasionally\
  \ getting stung and blaming it on us with a howl of laughter. Sometimes, we would\
  \ sing Jaime songs while we mixed soaps in the lab and he\u2019d smile his smile.\n\
  \t\n\tOne day, while I was peeling potatoes with Ana\u2019s mother, Mat\xEDas burst\
  \ in complaining that his sister would not even get out of bed on her son\u2019\
  s birthday. Robin and I exchanged glances.  \n\tWe ran to Jaime to offer to take\
  \ Victor into town for his birthday. While we waited for the two of them to get\
  \ ready, we sat in the garden in a misty, post-torrential rain silence.\n\t\u201C\
  She needs medicine.\u201D\n\t\u201CRobin, they have their own practices.\u201D\n\
  \t\u201CShe\u2019s dying.\u201D\n\t\u201CNo.\u201D\nBut Robin was right. I\u2019\
  d been writing about Ana\u2019s ailing health in my journal and the pages looked\
  \ bleak. Even Ana\u2019s mother had been muttering in the kitchen that the ritual\
  \ they had poured their efforts into for twenty-four hours only seemed to make things\
  \ worse. Robin\u2019s own medication had been helping her, and secretly I believed\
  \ Ana needed the same and quickly, but \u2013 it just did not seem my place to suggest\
  \ such a practice. I do wonder. Still today.\nAs I watched Robin eye the house,\
  \ it was evident that she was enraged with Ana. This woman was once an idol and\
  \ had suddenly become everything Robin hoped desperately not to be. A mother that\
  \ could not wake up for her son.\n\tVictor exploded out of his house and, chest\
  \ open to the volcano above, bellowed,\n\t\u201CVaaaaaaamos!\u201D\n\tJaime slipped\
  \ out too and patted him on the shoulder \u2013 please, don\u2019t wake mama."
