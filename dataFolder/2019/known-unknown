Text: "I stopped to look around. The stillness of it all pulled me in. Tall rectangular\
  \ structures casting long imposing shadows, neatly marked concrete roads lined with\
  \ equally spaced cars on either sides that looked like the colored metal tins lined\
  \ on my granny\u2019s shelves and a thin crispness in the air. Colorful summer blooms\
  \ on well-tended garden beds and a occasional fighter jet piercing right through\
  \ clear skies held my gaze.  I walked along the neat line of palm trees that lined\
  \ this neighborhood, situated a mile from the Pacific Ocean in the city of San Diego.\
  \ Miles away from the eastern hemisphere that I found familiar and knew for its\
  \ culture, order in chaos and color, I was on a journey to discover the familiarity\
  \ lurking around.\n                                      My chappals dragged on\
  \ in the hot California sun, as I passed a mail office. She was standing right outside\
  \ it. I sat nearby, on a bench overlooking a green well-maintained garden exclusively\
  \ for dogs. From a distance, I could see her struggling with her wheelchair. She\
  \ didn\u2019t look like she had yet made friends with her new companion. While talking\
  \ to her caretaker, waving one hand in the air she looked around to check if her\
  \ chihuahua had ventured too far away. The granny looked like she was well looked\
  \ after, with her short white hair tied in a bun and that the California winter\
  \ and the following sun and done her good. Struggling for some reason unknown to\
  \ me, she wheeled herself away in a sudden moment of angry abandon. Her hands threw\
  \ themselves in a wild abandon and the head shook between nods and heaves. The chihuahua\
  \ picked up the cue and gave its freedom one last sharp tug. The lady in the white\
  \ formal short and a baggy grey pant who stood by as her caretaker, tried her best\
  \ to abandon all facial expressions.  \n                             \n        \
  \                          Something in me moved, and I stood to walk over to the\
  \ mail box outside the office. Pretending to put in a mail, I turned around and\
  \ looked directly into the elderly lady\u2019s eyes and smiled. She smiled back.She\
  \ had found her warmth. I had found my peace in the unknown. The picture was now\
  \ perfect."
