Text: "We were halfway across the dry desert before the possibility of not being able\
  \ to make it back in time struck us in all seriousness.\n\nThe camel continued to\
  \ sprint, colourful tassels of its headgear swinging frenziedly, and our cart bumped\
  \ along behind, the two of us half-hanging on to what was essentially a plank of\
  \ wood on wheels. \n\n\u201CHow far is it, bhaiiya?\u201D I yelled at the camel\
  \ driver over the wind. The reply came in a mix of grunts I couldn\u2019t decipher.\
  \ I had been distracted by something else; the silhouette of a few figures had suddenly\
  \ appeared up ahead.  \n\nThis was the middle of the Great Rann of Kutch, one of\
  \ the world\u2019s largest salt deserts, part of the Great Indian Thar. It resembled\
  \ an artist\u2019s palette, the narrow dirt road merging into dark stretches of\
  \ gritty sand, which vanished into a horizon of dull gold and blinding sky. Around\
  \ us, there was only nothingness and the approaching figures. \n\nWe had started\
  \ off as tourists at the Rann Festival, being shuttled from the festival camp to\
  \ nearby viewpoints so we might catch a glimpse of the famed white rann, the pristine\
  \ salt desert that shone like silver in documentaries and tourism ads. But visibility\
  \ relied on favourable weather and light conditions, which had eluded us so far.\
  \ \n\nAnd so, on our last day at camp and a few hours before the last bus was scheduled\
  \ to leave, we enlisted one of the camel carts and paid the driver to take us to\
  \ the nearest patch of the salt desert. Figured that standing on its brink was the\
  \ only way we were sure to see it. \n\nSoon, we were a mile away from camp and had\
  \ bypassed the vehicular road that was used for driving up close to the salt marshes,\
  \ a road that was well-manned and mapped. Beyond it, we were specks in the horizon.\
  \ \n\nOur cart had meanwhile teetered to a halt and the specks in our horizon had\
  \ turned into men in grubby uniforms with guns across their backs. \n'Shit, did\
  \ we need a permit to be here?' 'Were we going to be sent to the prison for deranged\
  \ runaways?' Worse yet, 'were we in actual danger?' \nThis was, after all, the hinterlands\
  \ of a country where anything goes. The local communities were no stranger to acts\
  \ of aggression. The Indo-Pak border wasn\u2019t far. \n\nLater in life, I\u2019\
  d think back to this moment and remember feeling that I had finally gone too far,\
  \ that I should have done the things I wanted to when I had had the chance. When\
  \ I wasn\u2019t the woman stranded in the middle of a desert, next to a camel, with\
  \ three gun-toting men staring us down. \n\n\"Ky\u0101\u1E41 ja'\u012B rahy\u0101\
  \u1E41 ch\u014D?\" (where are you going?) \n\nOne of the men had come forward. Our\
  \ rider responded in the same dialect. \"Ladies from the camp\u2026 they want to\
  \ see the salt\u2026 \"\n\nThe men exchanged glances. I glanced at my friend. \n\
  \n\"We are going there too. We will ride with you.\"\n\nI blinked. \n\nSilence.\n\
  \n\"Yes?\" \n\nYes, okay. \n\nWe shuffled in as they hauled themselves onto the\
  \ plank. We set off again; at a slower pace, but with renewed hope.\n\nAlong the\
  \ way, the men struck up a conversation with us in broken Hindi. They were from\
  \ the nearby village, they said, responsible for guarding the desert perimeter.\
  \ They walked all the way every day from their homes to do their job. Life in the\
  \ desert was demanding, after all.  \n\nAnd us? Where had we come from? Two girls\
  \ from the cities, chasing a chimera in the desert, so far from home. One of the\
  \ men had been to the city once, but hadn\u2019t enjoyed it. Life in the city was\
  \ demanding too. \n\nThe wind whipped the sand into our hair and eyes, and we saw\
  \ that the dull gold of the horizon had disappeared while we talked. Instead, we\
  \ were now facing miles and miles of a leaden silver; chalk-hued at the edge, crystalline\
  \ white in the distance. \n\nWe were halfway across the desert, and we probably\
  \ wouldn\u2019t make it back in time, but we had finally arrived. \nAll of us."
