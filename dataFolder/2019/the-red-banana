Text: "I look down at the torn stump of a train ticket in my hand and try to make\
  \ sense of the scribbled scrawl. At 120 Malawian kwacha (roughly 50 cents), it's\
  \ almost too good to be true for a four-hour journey through the African wilderness.\
  \ I can faintly decipher the bleached origin and destination (Liwonde to Nayuchi)\
  \ but other than the price, this faded yellow stub of paper is a mystery to me.\
  \ \n\nThe piercing screech of the train's whistle brings me back from my daydream\
  \ and I scamper down the platform, just as the carriages start to make their reluctant\
  \ journey into the scorching African sun. I'm conscious that if I miss this train,\
  \ today's task of crossing from Malawi into Mozambique will become considerably\
  \ more difficult. \n\nI squeeze my way into the overcrowded compartment, past passengers\
  \ ladened with all sorts of goods and produce, and almost knock over a vertical\
  \ cage of chickens. A hundred pairs of eyes turn on me as my poultry victims cackle\
  \ and crow. I search for a small vestige of space and smile as I hear the rustle\
  \ of bottoms shuffling along the splintery train pew, making a meager modicum of\
  \ room for me. \n\nSandwiched in, I survey my surroundings. The carriage is light\
  \ and breezy and the big wide windows are drawn all the way down to help blow away\
  \ the stifling heat. My new companions are brightly dressed in all types of African\
  \ garb and have the sorts of friendly faces that put you instantly at ease. \n\n\
  Malawi's lush greenery rushes past in a blur, and the hubbub of conversation casts\
  \ a strange spell. I realise I'm the only white face among a sea of local commuters\
  \ and travellers, but you wouldn't know there was anything different about us. That's\
  \ the Malawian way. \n\nThe group immediately to my right are munching quietly on\
  \ what appear to be red bananas, and intrigued, I can't help but stare. Before too\
  \ long, the closest person turns to me, shyly, and offers a small bunch of the cardinal-coloured\
  \ fruit. I shake my head and fein gracious thank yous, but they insist. As I break\
  \ one away from the cluster, I feel again the weight of 100 eyes. I look up, the\
  \ chatter returns and everyone continues with what they were doing. \n\nI slip the\
  \ creamy flesh from it's tiny red sheath and am amazed at the taste and texture.\
  \ Despite it's strange outwardly appearance, this is the best banana I have ever\
  \ eaten. I lean my head back against the bumpy carriage wall and smile. The generosity\
  \ of Africa never fails to astound. \n\nAs the train pulls into Nayuchi, just kilometers\
  \ from the Malawi/Mozambique border, a mother sitting across from me tries successfully\
  \ to catch my eye. She's cradling an infant child. \"Nome,\" she implores in Mozambican\
  \ Portuguese. \"Nome?\" \n\nI realise, flatteringly, she wants me to christen her\
  \ child. I look at the little bundle, asleep and oblivious to the world, wrapped\
  \ in a faded pink blanket. She's gracefully beautiful and her peacefulness reminds\
  \ me of my mother. \"Prudence,\" I murmur, saying Mum's name aloud to the train.\
  \ \"Pru-dens,\" the mother repeats, beaming and bowing. \"Prudens.\"\n\nI nod, pick\
  \ up my bag and shuffle out of the carriage and into the Nayuchi swelter. A puff\
  \ of wind plucks my little yellow train ticket from my pocket and it flutters off\
  \ towards the stark, African horizon. As I watch it drift slowly away, I think back\
  \ to my ebullient ride. I smile. And say a little prayer for Prudens and wonder\
  \ if she will ever know that bananas also come in yellow."
