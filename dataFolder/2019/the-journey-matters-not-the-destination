Text: "They said it is one of the few breathtaking places in the region of Donegal,\
  \ the north-western part of Ireland. I had just finished a five month Erasmus student\
  \ exchange program studying journalism, from January to June 2018, in the southern\
  \ city of Cork, when I decided to pack and solo travel this gorgeous region. After\
  \ a nine-hour bus ride on a unexpected warm and sunny week, I arrived in the city\
  \ of Donegal. Tired of the ride, I fell asleep in this charming hostel, reading\
  \ a brochure of what the region has to offer. I woke up the morning after at 7 a.m,\
  \ undecided where I would headed to, but determined to do it by bicycle.\n\nI entered\
  \ in the only bicycle shop of the small town, with two questions to ask a friendly\
  \ shop assistant. \xAB Can I rent a bicycle for the day ? \xBB and \xAB What places\
  \ would you recommend to visit ? \xBB First answer : \u201COf course\u201D. Second\
  \ answer : \u201CWell, if you really want to ride for the whole day, you can go\
  \ to Slieve League Cliffs. It is 50 km from here and it\u2019s a lovely ride along\
  \ the atlantic ocean.\u201D I had already seen the Cliffs of Moher which is arguably\
  \ the most famous place in Ireland and made me want to see other kinds of these\
  \ fascinating natural creations. I did not need to hear more. I gave him my I.D,\
  \ closed my backpack and hit the road. \n\nI seriously underestimated what two times\
  \ 50 km was, and the absence of other cyclist made me questioned that leap into\
  \ the unknown. The sun was shining, the grass was greener than ever, and the ocean\
  \ so clear. I discovered along the way secret beaches the coast would hide, with\
  \ average-sized waves, soft sand and grass in the background. Secret spots where\
  \ brave surfers would face a different kind of adventure. Around 3 pm, I was getting\
  \ closer to the Cliffs and started to feel exhausted of an endless uphill road.\
  \ \n\nWhat I have not mentioned thus far, is that the cliffs were not the only thing\
  \ I had in mind that day. Yes, it was the 30th of June and France, my country, played\
  \ against Argentina of Leo Messi in the FIFA World Cup. How could I manage appreciating\
  \ a once in a lifetime experience and watching my nation triumphing. I finally reached\
  \ my goal and admired Slieve League Cliffs. But I probably stayed ten minutes up\
  \ there and only saw a glimpse of this beautiful piece of nature. Why have I not\
  \ enjoyed more the reward of this endless ride ? I couldn\u2019t miss the game.\
  \ Deep down I knew I just couldn\u2019t. \n\nI got back on my bicycle and headed\
  \ back to the city of Donegal. Midway through the ride, I stopped in a local pub\
  \ of a small town named Carrick, to have a beer during the game. I was obviously\
  \ the only french guy. But the famous \xAB luck of the irish \xBB made me come in\
  \ at the 52nd minute. Yes, I arrived only five minutes before Benjamin Pavard\u2019\
  s outstanding goal. Yes, the one that was named best goal of the tournament. Yes,\
  \ the goal that completely changed the momentum of the game and helped France to\
  \ strike back, overcome Argentina and win it 4-3. Yes, it was that game that gave\
  \ France that killer instinct to go and get that trophy. And France wining the world\
  \ cup made this day even more special. \n\nOn the way back, I was not thinking of\
  \ the historical moment I had just witnessed, but only being grateful for the view\
  \ on my right. \nThis day was all about finding the emotional balance between where\
  \ I am and where I am from. Nothing compares to living the moment. But sometimes,\
  \ leaving the moment makes us appreciate even more other moments in the future.\
  \ Slieve League Cliffs were not what the day had best to offer. The journey, with\
  \ everything I saw and felt, was. \n\nIsn\u2019t it like this in other aspects of\
  \ life ?"
