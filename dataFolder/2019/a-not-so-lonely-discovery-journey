Text: "Are you going alone? They asked. Surprised faces and curious questions were\
  \ all over the place. To me, I was going to live a big adventure, and to them, seemed\
  \ I was going to a sad journey of loneliness. Guess who was right? Let\u2019s just\
  \ say I had the best month I could have ever asked for. The thing is, I didn\u2019\
  t went very far. Gosh, I didn\u2019t even left the country. But for someone who\
  \ is always seeking a challenge, that was more than enough.\n\nI had been to S\xE3\
  o Paulo before, but that was the first time I was all by myself... not only there,\
  \ but somewhere. With my head full of uncertainties, there I was, discovering not\
  \ only a new part of the city, but a new me. As I walked into those streets everything\
  \ made sense, it was all so different. Like me, like the way I used to feel different\
  \ in the place I\u2019m from.\n\nI still remember the first day. The local antiques\
  \ fair was just around the corner of the Benedito Calixto Square and that\u2019\
  s where I went looking for my first adventure. I\u2019m not gonna lie. At first,\
  \ I felt like a stranger in there. When I realized I actually was a stranger, that\
  \ was the moment I let myself be open to all kind of experiences that place could\
  \ bring me.\n\nI talked to other strangers, bought an ice cream that I considered\
  \ way too expensive, walked into little stores with urban arts, got lost trying\
  \ to get back \u201Chome\u201D and promised myself I was going to be back at that\
  \ fair to buy a little beautiful painting I saw. But I never did.\n\nAs the month\
  \ was passing by, I knew I belonged to that city. I wanted to walk through the Paulista\
  \ Avenue on a Sunday one more time just to be mad at the hundreds of people walking\
  \ there as well, but also appreciating every little thing and the diversity it showed\
  \ to me. I wanted to go back to Bixiga and go to all those restaraunts I didn\u2019\
  t have the chance to try on. I wanted to go to Catavento or any other museum that\
  \ I didn\u2019t have the chance to go because there\u2019s so many of them in there.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s a brazilian song called \u201CThere is no love in SP\u201D. It\u2019\
  s funny thinking about how we all feel different about so many things in this world.\
  \ And that\u2019s one of those situations, because I\u2019ve found love in S\xE3\
  o Paulo. Not the usual love, but the one that connected me to that place. A love\
  \ for a new me... discovering, maturing and giving me the certainty that you should\
  \ never quit doing something just because you\u2019re doing it alone. Actually,\
  \ I would venture to say that\u2019s exactly when you\u2019re going to have one\
  \ of the most complete journeys of your life."
