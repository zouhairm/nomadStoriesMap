Text: "My trip to Costa Rica didn't include Tamarindo. My friend and I were escaping\
  \ the Canadian winter and on a whim, we decided to travel to Costa Rica. Like many\
  \ North Americans, we booked ourselves an all inclusive trip- although not our preference,\
  \ but on a short notice, an all inclusive served its purpose and was budget friendly\
  \ for both of us. Guanacaste in Liberia, the capital, was our destination. When\
  \ we arrived, we were already taken away by the friendliness of the people and rather\
  \ impressed with the city's infrastructure. The cordial welcoming interaction with\
  \ the van driver paired well with the warm weather and beautiful sights out the\
  \ window. I already had a good feeling about this trip. My friend and I arrived\
  \ to the hotel, and after checking in and unpacking, we went to tour around the\
  \ hotel; get to know where we will be living, eating, swimming during our week long\
  \ stay. We were okay with the resort until we reached the beach. The beach was pebbly\
  \ not sandy, the shore was rocky, and there were no chaise-longs to sunbathe. I\
  \ wasn't excited anymore, because nothing matters to me more than swimming in the\
  \ sea, not the pool. Something was to be done - so I asked around for other local\
  \ beaches and one day we signed up for a day trip to a surfing beach. It was an\
  \ hour and a half away by car from our hotel and I was determined to explore this\
  \ beach so many were talking about over dinner and at the reception. We signed up\
  \ for the next day's drop off - by boat. It was a refreshing trip until we reached\
  \ Tamarindo. It's like we fell upon a gem and spotted it from a far. Long stretches\
  \ of surfers parked with their boards, scattered around like a mess that makes you\
  \ happy, similar to a perfect chaos. Sun was beaming, waves were soaring high, sand\
  \ was hot yet silky and many cafes stretching along. I immediately grabbed two chairs\
  \ and parked myself in front of a charming cafe that served beer, small bites, and\
  \ loud music. There were benches and swings to enjoy while sipping your drink, kids,\
  \ teens and elders all shared a quaint space of happiness. I walked along the shore\
  \ only to discover more joy along the way; families celebrating a Jewish marriage\
  \ at a hotel, hot slim surfers at every turn, a strip full of Italian gelato, Mexican\
  \ bites, Egyptian themed motels, Indie mood cafes, souvenir shops- a combination\
  \ of sweet and salty bites of your favourite foods that blended well together yet\
  \ enjoyable separately, when joined together, you fear of losing the distinct of\
  \ flavour of each yet you savour the combined exotic taste of each together, never\
  \ wanting it to completely fade away. I was euphoric for days as my friend and I\
  \ went back four times before our departure. Whatever disappointed us in Guanacaste,\
  \ was made up for it in Tamarindo. Everything we didn't find during our stay at\
  \ our resort, we found on the long days at Tamarindo; between chatting with couch\
  \ surfers, locals who entertained our tans and accents, and tourists who were living\
  \ every moment in Tamarindo in the best way possible, the purest form possible,\
  \ as Costa Ricans say it, Pure Life. Everything they encounter, every way they live,\
  \ however way they feel, they feel it as they say it best: Pura Vida. \nAlthough\
  \ my days in Tamarindo were limited, the euphoria and happiness I discovered there\
  \ were absolute as I savoured the simplicity of living and indulged in Costa Rica's\
  \ purest form being."
