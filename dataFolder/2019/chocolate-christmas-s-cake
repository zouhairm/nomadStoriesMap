Text: "I arrived Rio de Janeiro past Christmas's eve expecting to find at least soemething\
  \ to eat at the airport, only to find out that every single store was closed.\n\
  I tried not to worry, and took a cab to the hotel I was going to stay in Catete.\
  \ I asked the cab driver if any restaurants would be opened when we get there and\
  \ he said \"sure!\" \nI arrived at the hotel, the manager gave me the key to my\
  \ room and i proceed to ask him if he knew of some place I could eat. He had nothing,\
  \ but told me to download an app or to venture down on the street.\nHe told me the\
  \ neighborhood was safe, but everyone I know that had been to Rio told me a story\
  \ of how unsafe streets are. Specially at 11pm. Let alone Christmas's eve.\nI was\
  \ hungry and I didn't care. Also it was raining but my umbrella was on the bottom\
  \ of big case and I didn't had much time spare.\nSo there I went undee the rain,\
  \ 5 blocks to the left, 5 blocks to the right. Nothing. I was going to bed without\
  \ eating on Christmas's eve.\nI was now hungry and angry.\nThe manager Gustavo,\
  \ wished me a goodnight, I went to my room.\nBrushed my teeth, put my pijama on,\
  \ and as I was just about to hop into bed, someone knocked on my door.\nIt was Gustavo,\
  \ he must have felt really sorry for me, because he brought me a piece of chocolate\
  \ cake that they would serve on breakfast the next morning. He only asked me to\
  \ bring the plate back when I was done.\nI almost moved to tears. It was the yummiest\
  \ chocolate cake I've ever had and my Christmas's eve dinner."
