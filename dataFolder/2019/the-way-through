Text: "When you think of Maui, with all of its active volcanos and cascading waterfalls,\
  \ you imagine natural beauty filled with abundant life. But the hole I was staring\
  \ at, the hole I was about to drop myself into, represented everything of the opposite.\
  \ \n\nDan, our unofficial tour guide, was an Army veteran at age 30 who now chose\
  \ the barefoot and carefree living that Maui promised.\nHis lips curled into a smug\
  \ smile as he witnessed our reactions arriving at his special spot.\nNo tourists\
  \ knew of this cave, and for good reason. It was less than legal to be here, and\
  \ it most definitely had me questioning both my sanity and likelihood to get out\
  \ of this alive.\n\nThe seven of us could detect the uncertainty in each other\u2019\
  s eyes, even in the weak light of a single flashlight dancing in the obsidian darkness.\
  \ The nervousness became palpable in the tiny cave.\nLuckily, it didn\u2019t come\
  \ down to a ruthless game of rock, paper, scissors to decide the order in which\
  \ we would each drop into the next part of the cave. I was second to last. \n\n\
  Dan began explaining what to expect, how to successfully drop through the hole barely\
  \ wider than your average Joes hips, and tips on remaining calm. My ears were too\
  \ busy being drowned out by the violent pounding of my heart to take any of it in.\
  \ Screaming to me that I sure had better find a way out of this. \n\nBut today,\
  \ I was bigger than my fear. \n\nThe angle of the hole was in such a way that you\
  \ were required to hang onto the rock above you while sliding your legs into the\
  \ hole until you were ready for the plummet. The key was to become as straight as\
  \ you could whilst ignoring the goosebumps now charging up your body, giving you\
  \ a teaser of what\u2019s to come.  \n\nIt was my turn, and I was stationed in place.\
  \ I took a few breaths and let go. Within what felt like a split second I was plunged\
  \ into icy water that may have never seen any sunlight. My body was awake, every\
  \ cell exhilarated and intoxicated with adrenaline. \nAs I surfaced my instinct\
  \ was to find the closest wall for support. Using the others voices as a beacon,\
  \ I moved through the darkness towards them. Screaming escalated when our legs kicked\
  \ against each other and we inevitably imagined some hungry creature circling us.\
  \ \nMy hands found the wall, bringing a very short lived sigh of relief. \n\nThe\
  \ next part was supposed to be easy, scaling the wall up to our only exit. But I\
  \ was the shortest in the group at 5,2\u201D, meaning I couldn\u2019t reach the\
  \ ledges that people of average height would have no problem attaining. \nThe others\
  \ made it look effortless, long limbs whisking them up the wall and towards safety.\
  \ \nI, however, was having a serious problem with this. I was quickly losing adrenaline\
  \ and the voice in my head that really wanted me to make it out of this alive was\
  \ getting louder and louder.\n\nMy foot kept slipping off the only rock that was\
  \ level enough to imitate a launch pad. Every time I applied pressure to hoist myself\
  \ up, I would slip right off, and back underwater I would go. \nI had to find a\
  \ way. My muscles were burning, my fingers had become numb and I was now pleading\
  \ with whatever higher power I believed in at that moment.\nI told myself I could\
  \ do this, and with one more desperate leap, I did it. I had made safety.\n\nCrawling\
  \ out of the cave, I felt a part of myself get left behind in the darkness. \nI\
  \ took in a breath for what felt like the very first time, and said goodbye to the\
  \ old me. \nAs I welcomed the warm sun flooding over me I pondered an idea; that\
  \ maybe in order for you to feel reborn, to make it through, you must first feel\
  \ that perhaps you are going to die."
