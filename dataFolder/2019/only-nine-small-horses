Text: "As we drive our rental car from the old town of sleepy Archangelos down a dusty\
  \ dirt road we progressively immerge into the Mediterrean maquis and the static\
  \ noise of grasshoppers and insects, broken only by some bleating. \nAfter a few\
  \ kilometers at a walking pace in the attempt to avoid hitting one of the thousand\
  \ wild goats lazily grazing we get to a desert clearing, surrounded by ancient gnarled\
  \ olive trees. The intense smell of sage and thyme saturates the air.\nAnd there,\
  \ enclosed in the bare mountains of the island of Rhodes, apparently light years\
  \ away from the fluorescent chaos of touristic resorts and bazaars, lies the Faethon\
  \ ranch.\nWe look beyond the horse shelter and we see, near one of the stables,\
  \ a human figure.\nWhen he notices us he slowly gets closer, leaning on two wooden\
  \ crutches, while a stray looking dog runs barking towards us ahead of him. \nThe\
  \ old hippie offers us a toothless smile and let us in and, after a series of ritual\
  \ jokes about the sacred pizza \u2013 pasta \u2013 mandolino italian triad, he introduces\
  \ us to the animals. \n\u201CThese are the only specimen left in the world. Can\
  \ you imagine that?\u201D.\nThe man shakes his head. \n\u201COnly nine small horses.\u201D\
  \nHe tells us the name of each one of them, and describes in details their personalities\
  \ in details.\n\u201CThis fella here is a vain one, check out his mane... Ah, what\
  \ a showoff. The black one over there is moody. And that is our senior, the oldest\
  \ horse we've got. If he were a man he would be in his ninties. You can tell it\
  \ from his eyes, he has wise eyes.\u201D\nAnd indeed he does. \n\u201CThis is a\
  \ family. That's mama and that's papa, and guess who's that?\u201D\nThe smallest\
  \ horse I've ever seen in my life cheerfully stumbles to my outstreched hand.\n\
  Now, don't imagine the Faethon as ponies. Faethon horses are not ponies, they are\
  \ a miniature armonic version of standard horses, once loyal companions of every\
  \ Greek family and then, due to the industrial revolution, left behind and even\
  \ killed because useless, until the current state of semi extinction.\n\u201CHumans\
  \ can be mean. We've become so mean to Mother Nature\u201D\nWe remain silent in\
  \ the stillness of the sawdust ring.\n\u201CEveryone thinks that ancient artists\
  \ had no clue about proportions\u201D he laughs.  \n\u201CBut they've forgotten\
  \ about these little guys\u201D\nBeing an animal lover I can't be anything but moved\
  \ simply by standing that close to these almost unique creatures and thinking about\
  \ the dedication that this group of volunteers puts in trying to preserve the Faethon\
  \ species.\nWe cut the apples and the carrots we've brought along into slices, throw\
  \ them in a filthy bucket and offer them to the horses, that greets us neighing\
  \ and trotting to the stables fences. \nThe farmer then invites us to enter a small\
  \ cabin. On a bare plank there's a homemade bread loaf and a bunch of ripe tomatoes.\
  \  \n\u201CI've got everything i need, the sun, simple food...and company\u201D\
  \ he says and pauses gazing through the broken window to the hills while a mewing\
  \ cat rubs against our legs.\nHe has clear opinions about italians, he tells us\
  \ stories about the occupation, anecdotes about Marconi we are not completely sure\
  \ we understand and then walk us back to the stables, looking with affection and\
  \ pride at each single horse.\nWhen the lunchtime blazing sun starts beating down\
  \ we are invited in the shade of the big house, a rustic yet very welcoming building\
  \ that hosts traditional parties for the community, seminars and awareness-raising\
  \ activities about the rich flora and fauna of the Dodecanese island, involving\
  \ the new generations in the delicate aim of saving what's left of an extremely\
  \ complex ecosystem.\nEventually we says our goodbyes and walk back to our car,\
  \ then drive back to our hostel in a mixture of hope and subtle sadness, wondering\
  \ if next year, if we'll decide to go back to Rhodes, we will find ten small horses."
