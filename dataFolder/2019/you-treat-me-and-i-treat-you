Text: "I landed on Kuala Lumpur airport at 11pm without a plan. I rarely ever planned,\
  \ but arriving in a foreign country without a plan, accommodation for the night\
  \ and no language skills... I've had better ideas. I walked up to a taxi stand and\
  \ asked the young guy, who was about to close for help. He helped me book the cheapest\
  \ hostel for the night and a cheap taxi. He wrote his number on my receipt and said:\
  \ 'If you ever need someone to show you around.' Zharif. I smiled and left. Cute,\
  \ but I wasn't stupid. Or was I?\nThe next day i stepped into the draining heat\
  \ and humidity and got overwhelmed with the amount of people and noise.\nI asked\
  \ a stranger for directions to buy a sim card and after doing exactly that I walked\
  \ around the city. After a while I realised that said stranger was following me.\
  \ I tried to lose him, but was unsuccessful and hid in a KFC in China Town.\nThe\
  \ stranger was outside still staring at me through the window. I looked at my phone.\
  \ I didn't know anyone and had noone to call. Or did I? Zharif. \nI called him asking\
  \ for a tour around the city and 10 minutes later a black car with dark tinted windows\
  \ stopped at the entrance to China Town. \nI looked back and forth between the stranger\
  \ and the car. How bad could Zharif really be?\nI got into the car and it was the\
  \ best decision I could've made.\nHe drove with me through the slums surrounding\
  \ Kuala Lumpur to show me, what he called, the real life and brought me to a hidden\
  \ food market. We chose our food and I couldn't pronounce any of it nor did I know\
  \ what I chose, but I quickly learned it was spicy and would seriously hurt my insides.\n\
  He paid for my food and I paid for our drinks. \n'I treat you, you treat me.'\n\
  A phrase I should quickly know by heart.\nThe next morning he called me and said\
  \ he was in my street. Not a question, just a statement.\nI got into the car with\
  \ the tinted windows, and he said nothing. In general we didn't talk a lot, his\
  \ english was basic airport english and I was unable to communicate in malay. So\
  \ we tried a mix of english and body language. After seing the Twin Towers we met\
  \ up with his friends for lunch and they didn't seem fazed by the girl sitting at\
  \ their table not being able to talk to them. They gave me bit after bit of local\
  \ food I needed to try and only laughed a little when I cried from spiciness. I\
  \ paid the food, he paid drinks and dessert.\n\"I treat you, you treat me.\" \n\
  The next day he called me and just said 'monkeys'.\nWe drove to the Batu Caves,\
  \ a spot full of history, tourists and... monkeys.\nHe bought me a coconut drink,\
  \ and after a monkey stole it he said: 'I treat you, you treat monkey'. \nAfter\
  \ that we spent every day together and he showed me the beauty and the pain of his\
  \ city. He showed me mosque after mosque, temples, the graffiti scene, food markets,\
  \ his friends and family and how he lived. He showed me how to dress and with which\
  \ hand to eat.\nWhen he drove me to the airport after three weeks together i asked\
  \ him, why he did that for me and he explained that as a Malay he has to be invited\
  \ to Europe by friends to be able to travel.\n'Will you invite me, Lea?'\nI promised\
  \ and he laughed.\n'See. I treat you, you treat me.'\nAnd to this day he does. After\
  \ a year he sent me a picture of his girlfriend, after two years of his wedding\
  \ and after three years a picture of his first child. 'Maya Lea'. Named after one\
  \ of the bravest and most spontanious girls he ever met. He made me cry again, and\
  \ this time not from spiciness. He treats life with kindness and i hope life will\
  \ always do the same."
