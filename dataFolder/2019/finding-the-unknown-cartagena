Text: "I visited Cartagena on 2017. I didn\u2019t expect to find myself on a trip\
  \ that wasn\u2019t thinking to learned about me and my real spirit.\n\nThe real\
  \ objective about this trip, was to participate on Hay Festival, event that have\
  \ conferences, talks, lectures and speeches about cultural, social, literature,\
  \ health, care and important topics about human beings interests. \n\nWater:\n\n\
  Had the chance to realize who I was, teached me that the comes and goes of the waves,\
  \ while people walking on the seaside with the grimson glow as a background of their\
  \ lives, was a lesson about how people disappears from a day to another. How some\
  \ of them was my closest friends and now I don\u2019t have any idea if they are\
  \ alive or not. \n\nUnderstood that as part of the universe, we have a reason on\
  \ people\xB4s live and that\u2019s ok. Nothing is forever! We have to keep walking\
  \ in the path of life shining with the background that existence predetermined for\
  \ us.  \n\nAir:\n\nAlso listened in Plaza San Pedro the combination between colonial\
  \ architecture, with the sound of people\u2019s voices talking other languages,\
  \ create a special place when the old and new cohabited and let enjoy different\
  \ cultures, is a unique sensation that combinate cultures, musical genres, skin\
  \ colors, black or white explicitly. Mixes that explained, why my inner had vintage\
  \ even futuristic ideals, jumps from one idea to another and can be different individuals\
  \ in my body.\n\nLand:\n\nGraffitis, murals, and big people\u2019s faces smiling,\
  \ dancing or animals painted with warm and cold colours, joined native with foreigners,\
  \ on Getsemani streets. Roads created with stones, bricks, grey walls and millions\
  \ of tones, gave a visual party when shapes, strokes and lines created a postcard\
  \ impossible to forgive. \n\nFire:\n\nRichness, poverty, houses, buildings, museums,\
  \ palm trees, wind, sand, movements, nonverbal language. Cartagena is more than\
  \ these words, is a city that don\u2019t have a meaning in the dictionary, the pictures\
  \ don\u2019t do justice to their real beauty.\n\nA place that gives us the gift\
  \ to knowing oneself and match up with their tourist sites, returning to the essence\
  \ of us and the basis of the universe."
