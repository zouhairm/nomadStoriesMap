Text: "The thunderstorm had finally stopped. After three hours of sleep, a laborious\
  \ and confusing journey to the small, but sufficient room we were staying in and\
  \ a short walk around the unfamiliar and dusty streets of Split, Croatia fat drops\
  \ had begun to fall, confining us to our room. Forcing us to sort out our jumbled\
  \ thoughts. And now, the thunderstorm had stopped, and I stepped out the door and\
  \ breathed in the new life thick, hot moisture had breathed into the narrow cobbled\
  \ streets directly outside of our door. Suddenly, the dry intimidating city became\
  \ alive and vibrant with wetness and life, like a flower that simply needed a little\
  \ watering before blooming right before my eyes. \nWe were lucky enough to be in\
  \ a city teeming with life and excitement. Any people we met were eager to aid in\
  \ our enjoyment of their city most of all, the woman from whom we were renting our\
  \ accommodations, Lu. In the afternoon, following that life-giving thunderstorm,\
  \ we explored the city, gazing in wonder at the bright white stone walls of the\
  \ Diocletian palace, now populated by restaurants, shops, and flea markets. The\
  \ red-topped homes, clustered in a way that emulated a scene from a movie, which\
  \ we could see from the top of a bell tower in the very center of town. \nSimultaneously\
  \ tired and invigorated by this vibrant new city, with stomachs full of delicious\
  \ traditional Dalmatian food, we returned to our room. In our eagerness to leave\
  \ our room following the storm earlier in the day, we remained oblivious to the\
  \ fact that had we tried to turn on a light, the switch's empty, hollow click would've\
  \ been the only effect. The storm had knocked out all of our electricity and our\
  \ running water. What would have been a significant issue, however, quickly became\
  \ a testament to the people in the town, who were so willing to help us any way\
  \ they could, especially Lu.\nLu sprang into action the moment we contacted her.\
  \ The restaurant across the way offered us their ambient candles, an electrician\
  \ that lived nearby dropped all that he was doing to help. Meanwhile, people all\
  \ up and down the street, at Lu's request, gave us flashlights, offered us their\
  \ showers and bathrooms, and some restaurants even offered us meals. Lu seemed to\
  \ have a superhero of mobilizing people, even for small issues like a power outage.\
  \ She gave all that she could to people, her kind, jubilant energy, her smile, and\
  \ her generous nature all made people want to give back to her. The ability of a\
  \ community to come together in such a way, to aid two young women traveling on\
  \ their own for the first time was truly an incredible thing. After two days, the\
  \ outage was resolved, with Lu never once letting up on the incredible hospitality\
  \ she offered up to us. \nThe stone streets and castles that populate the screens\
  \ of viewers of Game of Thrones may have had the regal, ancient beauty that I anticipated\
  \ when coming to Croatia, but the incredible people and community that existed within\
  \ the narrow streets of the city I never would have been able to forsee, nor is\
  \ it something I will ever be able to forget"
