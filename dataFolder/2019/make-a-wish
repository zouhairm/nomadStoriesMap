Text: "Before I started  this trip, my friend C\xFCneyt, whom I mildly call Dju, had\
  \ warned me with the words that the most I would \u201Cget\u201D out of all this\
  \ would be to \u201Cget hurt\u201D. Badly. Why not come with me, did I ask the same\
  \ night while trying to make up my mind. He would simply smile at me with his terrific\
  \ blue eyes and say: \u201CIt is not the place for me, they will rape me there.\u201D\
  \ With these words in my head I signed up for the youth project in \u015Eanl\u0131\
  urfa, deep down in Turkey, where three nations will be surviving under the same\
  \ rooftop while war is happening 150 kilometres farther south. \n\nOur journey begins\
  \ at midnight when we take a bus from the capital and cross the country reaching\
  \ the Turkish border in several hours. My first impression of Turkish people who\
  \ do not consider themselves Bulgarians shows me a great respect to the customer\
  \ - they do not inquiring whether we would like more tea, sweets or water, lulu\
  \ break, hot, cold, new film on the TV. This somehow eases the suffering from the\
  \ overnight travel and upon arrival in Istanbul we soak up the morning breath of\
  \ the big city and are all enthusiastic about heading to the airport where we will\
  \ meet the other participants. And yet, the small flexible screen on the plane makes\
  \ me realise for first time how far we go from the civilization we know the best.\n\
  \nThe sky of Urfa is grey and unwelcoming. By contrast, our thrill, among colourful\
  \ laughs and jokes, traces our the way to the base which they rented specifically\
  \ for the project, former kindergarten. Our hosts are young people from Gaziantep\
  \ who want to change the world and who will challenge us to do so in the next seven\
  \ days. The message we are going to spread is simple: \u201CMake a wish\u201D and\
  \ let this wish be for a place to accommodate the spirits and the daydreams of all\
  \ those people chased by the wrecking misunderstanding of human live\u2019s value.\n\
  \nThe organisers stand out as people with broadened horizon, nevertheless, at our\
  \ first dinner as a newborn community some rules are being introduced: we cannot\
  \ take everything for granted the way we do in Europe, some privileges, which we\
  \ share as Europeans, must remain there. As the personal choice to walk in the street,\
  \ go out in the evenings after dinner, be dressed as you would usually be in a hot\
  \ weather, flirt with strangers or even sweet talk in the coffee shops. We have\
  \ a strict agenda and a goal to accomplish; our days are filled with visits of local\
  \ youth organisations, work on the specific proposals we have for the municipality,\
  \ rehearsals and international nights, including a lot of cooking and culture exchange.\
  \ \n    \nUntil the day of the excursion. We leave early in the morning and travel\
  \ for an hour or two. Soldiers stop us on the way and here, in the deepest part\
  \ of Turkey, where we mean nothing to any of these people, we smell the warning\
  \ signals of the guns hanging on the shoulders, recently used.  When we are finally\
  \ at Halfeti, I cannot hold myself but breathe from the air down here with all the\
  \ thankfulness of a human being who is alive at the present moment. My eyes fell\
  \ on a rock nearby. There, where Euphrates calmly shifts its waters from centuries\
  \ ago, I write my wish on a rock. Because we are not at all far from the civilization\
  \ we belong to. We are where the civilization we belong to embraced its future,\
  \ where it learned how to crawl, walk, ride a horse, travel between lands."
