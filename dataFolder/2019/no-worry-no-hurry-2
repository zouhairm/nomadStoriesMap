Text: "Fiji... where do I begin. Over 300 islands in the pacific ocean, each one stunning\
  \ in it\u2019s own way. My short time here was spent on three different islands,\
  \ away from the mainland. I was wanting a taste of local and island life\n\nWhat\
  \ I experienced was so much more. Learning that Fijians have got to be some of the\
  \ friendliest and happiest I have met. After spending 16 days around New Zealand\
  \ (anthother story for another time) I was ready to embrace the \u2018no worry,\
  \ no hurry\u2019 life I had heard so much about. \n\nMy first island was Tavewa\
  \ island (Yasawa islands) and was greated by the friendly staff of Coral View. Greated\
  \ with Bulas and hugs it already felt like home. I more \u2018formal\u2019 resort\
  \ with menu choices and aircon in the dorms, the staff could not do enough to make\
  \ you feel comfortable. Around dinner time they would come and sit with you talking\
  \ about their lives and yours. \n\nNanuya Lailai was my next island, visiting Sunrise\
  \ Lagoon Homestay. Another warm welcome to the island and their compound. This was\
  \ much more relaxed with local children and animals running around. Dinner and breakfast\
  \ were served each day, with everyone congregating around one table for a real community\
  \ feel. \n\nNaqalia Lodge was my final stay on Wayasewa island. It was very much\
  \ a mixture of the two. Auntie Mary straight in with a hug and songs being sung\
  \ on the beach. A family run lodge where laughter can be heard all day. More communial\
  \ meals and delicious meals they were too! Jamming sessions in the evening - most\
  \ Fijians seem to play the guitar. Card games too. \n\nMy time in Fiji was definitely\
  \ a memorable one. I have never felt so welcome in a country from the moment I landed\
  \ to the moment I left. Everyone smiling all the time. I hope you feel the same\
  \ when you visit too.  And remember... no worry, no hurry."
