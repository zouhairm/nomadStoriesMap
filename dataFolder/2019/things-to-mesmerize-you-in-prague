Text: "place\nTo gift much a curious case\nWe\u2019ve all heard of The Hague\nBut\
  \ my readers this is Prague.\nFor all you avid touristers\nThis place is great to\
  \ bring your misters(and your ownself too).\nEurope is too splendid and too beautiful,\
  \ too diverse and too picturesque just to be captured by visiting the western side.\
  \ The true beauty, the romantic music, the spooky history, the folk dances,the communism,\
  \ the socialism, the dancing nights and the painful dungeons .\n\nMedieval astronomy,\
  \ gothic architecture, colourful baroque buildings ,historical core, everything\
  \ that the common folk identifies Europe by.\nThe civil wars, the raging wars, the\
  \ educated nobility, the problematic peasantry. The fanciest fairy tales, the horrendous\
  \ horror tales, they all belong here.\nThe heart of Europe,geographically,literally,truthfully,soulfully,culturally.\n\
  \nSuch vastness, such cultural dimensions, all enclosed and bloomed in one territory.Hard\
  \ to believe,right? Trust me you\u2019ll be stunned,and history buffs will take\
  \ the immediate flight. Direct or non direct.\n\nCentral Europe. The virgin,secluded,unmolested\
  \ beauty that not everybody knows.\nThe taste of ecstasies\nThe tunes of rhapsodies.\n\
  \nFashion, culture, food, extravaganza, history, astronomy, architecture, music,\
  \ classics, you name it they have it.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody is a classic song.\n\
  Rhapsodise in the once-capital of Bohemia.\nWelcome to the City of Bohemians.\n\n\
  Rhapsody means an epic work of poetry, sometimes with religious overtones. Bohemian\
  \ Rhapsody is a popular classic rock song by Queen. Rhapsodise means to write or\
  \ experience a rhapsody. Bohemia covers most of present day Czech Republic.\n\n\
  Exclusive, extravagance.\n\nMaking some soulful sense, am I?\nWait till you get\
  \ there."
