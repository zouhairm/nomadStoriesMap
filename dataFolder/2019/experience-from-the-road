Text: "BANGLADESH is my neighbouring country still I didn't get a opportunity to visit\
  \ there so I decided to visit there and want to encounter with my eyes what I heard\
  \ about the country was really true or not? On the decided day I took a flight and\
  \ I reached Bangladesh within an hour or so , rested in a hotel then started my\
  \ journey. The crowds are amazing. I have never seen so many people condensed together\
  \ in one tiny little area. My God, there are so many people in that tiny little\
  \ country. Dhaka is an amazing experience, if nothing else, for the crowds. Watch\
  \ rush hour in Dhaka with all of the bicycle rickshaws flooding the streets and\
  \ colliding with each other. Wow! The pollution, confusion, and pure mass of the\
  \ crowds in Dhaka outweigh any other city I have yet seen on the Indian subcontinent.\
  \ It was thrilling and amazing to experience, but at the same time I would sometimes\
  \ think to myself, while negotiating the crazy crowds, \u201CI wonder if there is\
  \ a way that I can push my flight up and leave a little sooner.\u201D It is an amazing\
  \ experience, but utterly exhausting.\nThe people are perhaps the most hospitable\
  \ in the world. So many people are just genuinely interested in you and where you\
  \ come from. They ask so many questions; they are so curious. And, surprising for\
  \ such a poor country, there is so much that you will never have to pay for just\
  \ because the person sitting next to you, so utterly enthralled to have a conversation\
  \ with an Indian, will ask to pay it for you and refuse to let you do so. Anywhere\
  \ I went I would be engaged in a conversation with someone and sometimes I would\
  \ even end up following them home or to their office, by invitation, at least in\
  \ part because they wanted to show me to their friends or family. But, really, it\
  \ is an excellent opportunity for an authentic cultural experience .Bangladesh is\
  \ really a beautiful country, although it doesn\u2019t have dramatic mountains or\
  \ amazing beaches. But, what I found so amazing was the endless waterways of the\
  \ country and the greenary. There seems to be water flowing everywhere! It is almost\
  \ a sea in itself. And it is so beautiful. I feel so lucky to have seen where the\
  \ massive rivers of the Indian subcontinent are so close to flowing in the sea.\
  \ And the Sundarbans is truly a special place in the world as well.\nThe tourist\
  \ slogan for Bangladesh is \u201CBefore the tourists come.\u201D Well, I think that\
  \ this pretty much says it. Sometimes Bangladesh is too much, really. The crowds,\
  \ the attention, the pollution. It really can make you feel very exhausted. But\
  \ I feel that the good far outweighs the bad, and I am quite glad that I spent the\
  \ little amount of time I did in Bangladesh. It really is an amazing experience\
  \ to visit that I will remember for the rest of my life. It is a very special place\
  \ to visit greatly because tourism is so yet undeveloped and thus the people are\
  \ so extremely hospitable and friendly. I do hope that I can visit for a longer\
  \ amount of time sometime."
