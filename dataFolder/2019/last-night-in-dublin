Text: "\u201CI haven\u2019t known you long enough to say I love you,\u201D he said,\
  \ haltingly.\n\nWe were surrounded on all sides of the patio by vibrantly anonymous\
  \ patrons of The George, one of Dublin\u2019s most popular gay bars. Though completely\
  \ public, we were also fully alone, the remnants of our desperately energized dance\
  \ to Whitney Houston tactile in the charming sweat on his back, drying in the gentle\
  \ air  and cigarette smoke of the summer evening. \n\nSmiling nervously, he continued:\n\
  \n\u201C\u2026but I can\u2019t explain it any other way.\u201D\n\n\u2014\n\nI went\
  \ to Dublin for a gig. I play classical piano and often get to travel for it. It\u2019\
  s an especially wonderful lifestyle, because depending on the gig, I get a lot of\
  \ free time to gather inspiration from the world around me, while simultaneously\
  \ diving into a local community whose official language is music. \n\nBeyond mandatory\
  \ rehearsal, queer spaces are usually my first destination \u2014 there I can be\
  \ both tourist and local, with a set of universal aural and visual cues complicated\
  \ exquisitely by the subtleties of specific geography, local norms, and expectation.\
  \ A series of rewarding monogamous relationships meant that these explorations of\
  \ queer spaces had been only observational, purely platonic. \n\nI went to Dublin,\
  \ though, after a emotionally tough breakup, and before I left I made a plan: the\
  \ trip was to be a kind of sexual awakening. Two days before I left, I mustered\
  \ up the courage to finally conquer the sacred quest, and I visited the Boiler Room,\
  \ a bathhouse for primarily gay men located just off of Temple Bar, Dublin\u2019\
  s cobblestone crawl of pubs and eateries. Temple Bar doesn\u2019t feel as suffocating\
  \ as it could, considering the saturation of drunk tourists \u2014 perhaps because\
  \ there\u2019s also a joyous rebellion of folks who congregate there, immigrants\
  \ and locals, straight and queer. It was in this intersection where I met Tom\xE1\
  s.\n\nThe batthouse was an alternate erotic universe I\u2019d never experienced\
  \ \u2014 the guys hot and sweaty, wrapped in only towels and popping in and out\
  \ of hot tubs, steam rooms, and private quarters. Beautiful Tom\xE1s could have\
  \ been just another half-nude object of admiration, but serendipitous hesitation\
  \ gave space for us to smile at each other. We kept smiling. And we made out, finding\
  \ our way to a private room upstairs. We didn\u2019t leave the bathhouse until it\
  \ closed just before dawn, and then walked back to my hotel, where we laid in bed\
  \ together and told each other our stories. I told him about my piano playing, about\
  \ the performances I had, about how I lived in New York. I learned that he was a\
  \ Czech immigrant, the director of a school, a former model (bucket list item),\
  \ and, rather improbably, almost twice my age. He was, most crucially, immensely\
  \ kind.\n\nI nervously offered him a ticket to my show that night, just before he\
  \ left my room.\n\n\u201CI would love that,\u201D he answered gently.\n\nAfter the\
  \ show the next day, through which his image was seared into my mind, I searched\
  \ desperately for him, in between socializing with the presenters and other musicians.\
  \ Nowhere to be found, I held my deflation until I could get back to my hotel room\
  \ and check my Facebook messages.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t find you\
  \ after the show,\u201D he had written, after a few searching messages sent earlier.\
  \ \u201CBut what are you doing tomorrow? I want to show you my Dublin.\u201D\n\n\
  By myself, I visited churches, art galleries, highly recommended restaurants and\
  \ played with a major orchestra. But none of it was nearly as beautiful as the eating\
  \ crappy Chinese buffet with him, or the homemade walking tour we took, or dancing\
  \ intertwined at The George, forgetting about the impossibility of all of it, or\
  \ what would happen when I left the next day.\n\nWe said goodbye a few hours before\
  \ I had to board my flight. I turned back around, to catch him stealing one last\
  \ glance as well. The corridor of stone buildings refracted the sound of many drunk\
  \ folks staggering home, but I was only conscious of the memory of his voice on\
  \ the patio, wondering if anyone else had heard it, if it was real at all."
