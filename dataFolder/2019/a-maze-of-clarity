Text: "Direction turned into an abstract concept as we barreled deeper into the pitch\
  \ black rocky shafts. Holding on to each other\u2019s clammy hands, we followed\
  \ our Turkish guide\u2019s voice as he took us into the secret subterranean tunnels\
  \ of Cappadocia\u2019s famed Kaymakli Underground City. Our breathing quickened\
  \ and feet tripped over uneven surfaces. The spaces were now so narrow, that even\
  \ our shorter than average Hobbit-like frames had to contort to get by.\n\n\u201C\
  Come along my angels, don\u2019t get lost!\u201D We heard Ozgur\u2019s voice floating\
  \ through the unlit passage. \n\nThere we were, three 25-year-old quarter-life crises\
  \ facing women, traipsing deep into Turkey\u2019s widest ancient underground city.\
  \ We were following our guide, a sweet, 40-something man we\u2019d known for only\
  \ a day, into a labyrinth of rock. \n\nNo cellphone coverage, dark corridors, with\
  \ every possibility of getting lost. What could go wrong? A lot, in hindsight. At\
  \ that moment, though, we were fearless voyagers. In the midst of our shattered\
  \ hearts, aborted dreams and directionless existence, we sought blind adventure.\n\
  \n\u201CInvaders would often get lost in these tunnels,\u201D our guide Ozgur, told\
  \ us earlier. \u201CI have access to the lower levels that aren\u2019t allowed to\
  \ the full public. If you want, we can go.\u201D All we had to do was look at each\
  \ other to know. There was no question, we were following him into the bowels of\
  \ the Earth. We weren\u2019t burdened anymore, we were children exploring the unknown.\
  \ \n\n\u201CZinnia!\u201D I called out to make sure my friend, bringing up the rear\
  \ of our quartet didn\u2019t fall behind. The tunnel run had begun quite slowly,\
  \ with Ozgur letting us feel our way through the maze. He insisted on keeping his\
  \ torchlight off, allowing us to experience what the inhabitants did. He soon began\
  \ a practised sprint, leaving us to catch up as we squat-walked, pirouetted and\
  \ squeezed past rocky surfaces that would scrape and scratch if we made the mistake\
  \ of getting too close. \n\nMuch to my relief, the tunnel opened up into the living\
  \ chambers that families slept, lived and cooked in, centuries ago. The walls were\
  \ laden with the stories and tragedies of generations that made this underground\
  \ city their home, safe and protected from ravaging marauders and bandits.\n\nWe\
  \ huddled together, shivering, holding hands as Oz\u2019s voice took us on a journey.\
  \ Our minds conjured up a time so different from ours that it felt unreal. So many\
  \ lives were lived confined in a massive underground maze that connected the dwellings.\
  \ I imagined children bounding through the passages, playing games as wild as their\
  \ imagination would allow, unafraid and familiar with every crevice and ledge. Entire\
  \ households and their animals slept in the chambers smaller than an average city-sized\
  \ living room. Storage rooms, kitchens, stables, ventilation shafts were all carved\
  \ into the soft volcanic rock that covered Cappadocia. The entire community would\
  \ cook together in the stealth of the night so that their enemies would be alerted.\
  \ Huge rock boulders would roll and block off entryways to keep the inhabitants\
  \ safe. \n\n\u201CJust like you, right now, you are safe,\u201D Oz said. And it\
  \ was ironic that it took travelling thousands of miles away from home, going deep\
  \ into the earth and holding a stranger's hand to finally understand the meaning\
  \ of that word.\n\nThere was only us, our pounding hearts and the Earth. If I ever\
  \ felt close to an inexplicable force, larger than me, it was in this moment. We\
  \ sat there in darkness unlike any other, enveloped in a strange unsettling calm,\
  \ away from the debilitating pressure of our lives. \n\nThe walk back seemed shorter\
  \ than I remembered. This time, lead by our guide\u2019s torch, I was almost reluctant\
  \ to keep going. But, as I saw the soft glow of the city at the end of the widening\
  \ tunnel, the waves of relief I felt in the chamber came rushing back, keeping me\
  \ tethered to what I can only describe as an otherworldly, spiritual experience.\
  \ \n\nI slept soundly that night, wrapped in the vast safety of a magical rock shelter."
