Text: "On a summer morning in mid-July I climb out of a hot Ukrainian night train\
  \ into an equally hot Ukrainian nowhere. Regional center of Khmelnitsky is so authentic\
  \ that instead of a usual McEvil restaurant travelers are greeted by a string of\
  \ dark little shops selling everything from local poppy bread to orthodox icons.\
  \ A city-girl I can hardly imagine two weeks in a local village with an impossible\
  \ name of Medzhybizh. But when a giant medieval tower looms over the bus stop, I\
  \ am ready for all the tents and summer showers ahead. How much can you pay for\
  \ time travel?  \nForgotten, Medzhybizh is wrapped in history. Even the director,\
  \ who comes to show the archaeologist headquarters in the Officer Tower, reminds\
  \ of a musketeer or a pirate. He lures me by showing a 100-year old bottle of wine\
  \ recently found in the well. \u201CBy a volunteer like you.\u201D But to deserve\
  \ the honor one must visit the Stone Age.    \nAs the first morning light sparkles\
  \ on the far bank of the river Bug, I walk through the endless fields of grass.\
  \ These are my lands, and I feel confident guiding our bright multinational group.\
  \ We walk past the gates with a Star of David hiding in the tall grass and wildflowers.\
  \ A faded shadow of the old war. And down to the river, where Vadim is already sieving\
  \ through a 400,000 old layer, He\u2019s hunting for fossils, and no one dares to\
  \ voice the main goal - to find the traces of ancient men. These first days we are\
  \ carefully watched. Ukrainian archaeologists face enough obstacles: from amateur\
  \ gold diggers to village cows that destroy precious layers.\nAs a child I dreamt\
  \ to be an archaeologist. And now by some strange whim of destiny I am standing\
  \ one leg in Paleolithic writing down coordinates of Vadim\u2019s finds. He explains\
  \ that the tooth in a transparent packet belonged to an elephant. \u201CNot a mammoths?\u201D\
  \ - Paul, a Swiss volunteer asks.  \u201CMammoths came here much later\u201D. Paul's\
  \ jaw drops. \nWe return when the sun hits its zenith. All covered in sand and dust,\
  \ like ancient hunters, we walk through the entrance of the Fortress. A group of\
  \ tourists flocking at the ticket office stare as we go on to our tents under the\
  \ large oak tree in the corner of the yard. Back to the Middle Ages, some go on\
  \ to wash in a summer shower next to the main Palace, others cut vegetables for\
  \ dinner behind the museum of ethnography. After a couple of days you stop noticing\
  \ people with cameras roaming around while you\u2019re washing your T-shirt. \n\
  At six the gates close, and volunteers are left alone with the security guard and,\
  \ if lucky, one of the guides. Medzhybizh museum workers are as unique as the place\
  \ itself. Tatiana leads us up the tower in summer storm. And one day Pan (Ukrainian\
  \ for \u2018Mr\u2019) Igor appears in traditional jewish clothes and walks us \u201C\
  to the Hasids\u201D. Two streets from our homely Middle Ages stands the birthplace\
  \ of Hasidism, the official religion of Israel. Pan Igor jokes that he uses jewish\
  \ clothes to trick the cameras around the main synagogue. \u201CWhen security is\
  \ asked \u201Cwho was that roaming our sacred sites again?\u201D, he just answers\
  \ \u201CAh, there was some jewish guy with his friends from the city.\u201D \nThe\
  \ district of Hasids is just as international as our group. I hear a man with a\
  \ distinct American accent discuss some bonds outside the ancient cemetery. Every\
  \ gravestone has a symbol with its own special meaning. But let the Hasids have\
  \ their privacy. \nWe walk on to a once impressive arches of Trinity Church. Here\
  \ a national hero of three countries Tadeusz Koszushko was struck by an unhappy\
  \ love for young Teklia. Every walk through Medzhybizh attracts stories. An old\
  \ woman walks up to me and urges to \u201Clook in the well of the round tower for\
  \ a precious sword Turks dropped when they ran from the Polish army.\u201D A taxi\
  \ driver spills about two road workers who found a sack of golden coins on the old\
  \ road. All these little tales create a very special mood around this secret and\
  \ sacred place."
