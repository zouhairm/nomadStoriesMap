Text: "It was the last summer of 2017. Searching for some places, looking for great\
  \ taste. Clicking and scrolling down, what things to do, what to eat, where to stay.\
  \ That time was a summer holiday, I lived in Taiwan taking my degree and that summer\
  \ was special for me, my family just arrives in Taiwan to visit me. We had a great\
  \ time for 5 days in Taiwan but still expecting something more to come all the way\
  \ to our holiday trip. Day 2 in Taiwan while having a full plate of dim sum in Din\
  \ Tai Fung, that something came by across my mind.\n\n\"How about we are going to\
  \ Hong Kong?\"\n\nAnd what they say about it? \n\"How we go there? Should we take\
  \ the city tour?\"\n\nNope, we should go by ourself. This is where the story begins.\
  \ In short, I got my own itinerary for this family trip. I did not expect to tick\
  \ all my checklist on this trip since I went with my parents. Thinking this should\
  \ be relaxing, fun and not too exhausting trip. Booked our flight and hotel for\
  \ 5 days 4 nights, we were ready to take off. My first time travel with my own itinerary\
  \ and me myself as the guide, so pumped and a little bit nervous. \n\nMorning flight\
  \ around 10 AM, leaving the hotel after our breakfast. Rushed to the airport, checked\
  \ in then into the cabin and then someone hit my back. Turning my head back, he\
  \ said\n\n\"Hey yo, you are going to Hong Kong dude?\" said in Chinese\n\nThis man,\
  \ his name is Jack. One of my friend from my university and I feel so lucky, Hong\
  \ Kong is where he comes from. Having a little chit chat and he says that I could\
  \ ask him everything while staying here. After 2 hours of flight, we arrived. Claimed\
  \ out our baggage, Jack told me not to leave before he shows me something important\
  \ to do. Firstly first, MTR pass card. Second, some suggestion for my questions\
  \ and the third of course\n\n\"Have a nice day here, hope you enjoy here in my country,\
  \ call me whenever you need something to help.\" \n\nSpeak in Cantonese, he helped\
  \ me to talk with the taxi driver and sent me off to the hotel. Such a nice friend,\
  \ I should treat him when we get back to Taiwan. Arrived at the hotel around 2 PM,\
  \ check-in and put aside our stuff, had a quick lunch and off to our first destination\
  \ 'Madame Tussauds' wax museum. It was not so hard to get there, we got to The Peak\
  \ and mimicked some of the big stars there. Jackie Chan, Obama, Michael Jackson,\
  \ Mr President Jokowi was there, and many more. Taking pictures and to the peak\
  \ for selfies. Buying souvenir there, great vibes and a full load of people. Day\
  \ 1, The Peak and Madame Tussauds. \n\nNext day, we bought Ocean Park tickets. As\
  \ we look to the Ocean Park map\n\"Looks like we will walk a lot.\" \n\nMaybe not\
  \ if they have a train to ride. We queued up and stepped into Ocean Express Train,\
  \ fully packed. It designed so well and looks like a submarine. Taking a quite distance\
  \ to the other side for us to see a big robot. Wander in the middle of Seaquarium,\
  \ coolest thing to see at the end of the day. After that, we are going to the night\
  \ market for dinner and pork belly. Temple Street Night Market, a famous night market\
  \ in Hong Kong. \nDay 3, we off to see Bruce Lee at The Avenue of Stars and take\
  \ some pictures of beautiful Tsim Tsa Shui. Seek for typical best of Hong Kong foods,\
  \ Hong Kong best offer. What I loved the most and best of the best is Yum Cha Dim\
  \ Sum. Unique, creative, funny and great taste. They said Yum Cha means \"drink\
  \ tea\" in Cantonese is a time for family or friends to gather to savour a table\
  \ full of dim sum, tea and delicious bites. \nWe are leaving to Macau for the next\
  \ day but in the future, I will definitely come back here for dim sum."
