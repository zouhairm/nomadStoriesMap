Text: "Last year, I ticked off a major #TravelGoal and visited beautiful Cuba! Like\
  \ many, Cuba has been a dream of mine to visit for many years, I have always been\
  \ intrigued by the art, music, fiery politics and interesting history.\n\n\u201C\
  it is estimated that 72% of the Cuban population practise Santeria\u201D\n\nA major\
  \ source of inspiration during my visit, was having the opportunity to learn about\
  \ Cuban spirituality and religion after visiting a Santeria church in Hana . The\
  \ most popular religion in Cuba is Santeria (it is estimated that 72% of the Cuban\
  \ population practise Santeria), a religion rooted in both Yoruba religion and Catholicism,\
  \ rising out of Spanish slavery and colonialism.  During the Spanish conquest of\
  \ Cuba, West African slaves were forced to abandon their indigenous beliefs and\
  \ adopt Catholicism, this resulted in many West Africans worshipping catholic saints\
  \ whilst bringing forth Yoruba cosmology and Orishas in secret. The very word Santeria\
  \ was bought about by Spanish Catholics who labelled the West African slaves worship\
  \ of various catholic saints as excessive, leading to the Spanish word \u201CSanteria\u201D\
  \ meaning the \u201Cworship of saints\u201D.\n\nThe popularity of Santeria, a religion\
  \ influenced heavily by a West African religion is really fascinating to me, coming\
  \ from a Ghanaian Christian household I am used to the colonial notions of African\
  \ indigenous beliefs being evil and deep rooted in backwardness. However, in contrast\
  \ many Cubans I spoke with both black and white, religious and non-religious had\
  \ a deep respect for the Santeria religion and recognised it as a key part of national\
  \ Cuban pride and heritage.\n\n Whilst in Cuba, I had the opportunity to speak with\
  \ a Santeria priest knows as a Santero I was told about how Santeria became popular\
  \ in Cuba during the 90s when the country faced a severe depression after the collapse\
  \ of the Soviet Union. Many Cubans found solace in Santeria and practised the religion\
  \ collectively. The Santero also spoke about the use of plants for healing and overcoming\
  \ mental or medical ailments. \n\nOne of the most popular deities is the Yoruba\
  \ Goddess Och\xFAn, the Queen of Rivers representing justice, ultimate femininity\
  \ and is associated with the colours yellow and amber. Beyonce famously channelled\
  \ Ochun in her music video \"Hold Up\".  Another significant deity is Yemoya representing\
  \ the creator, the mother of all things residing in the ocean. The catholic saint:\
  \ Our Lady of Regla is synonymous with Yemoya and can often be seen in churches,\
  \ appearing African and dressed in blue or white.\n\nThe emphasis on nature, dance,\
  \ rhythm and music in becoming closer to the spiritual world and ancestors is particularly\
  \ powerful when thinking of contemporary evangelical worship in Africa and throughout\
  \ the African diaspora. Interestingly, I was told by many Cubans that referring\
  \ to Santeria as an \u2018Afro-Cuban\u2019 religion was offensive as the religion\
  \ is truly a part of Cuban identity and shouldn\u2019t be labelled as \u2018Afro\u2019\
  \ or \u2018other\u2019 in any way.\n\nIf you find Santeria religion interesting\
  \ and plan on visiting Cuba soon, I recommend visiting Callejon De Hamel in Havana\
  \ a unique neighbourhood that has become a shrine for Cubans who practise Santeria.\
  \ Cuban artist Salvador Gonz\xE1les Escalona has adorned the area with Afro-Cuban\
  \ art inspired by Santeria and a mix of surrealism, cubism and abstract art."
