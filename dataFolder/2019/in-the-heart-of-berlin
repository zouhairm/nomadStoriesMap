Text: "The sky was a dazzling blue and birds were singing in the trees as I approached\
  \ the memorial that resembled a graveyard. It was a bitterly cold February afternoon\
  \ in Berlin, Germany. \n\nJackson Reid, an old friend and deeply patriotic classmate\
  \ of mine who I had taken a World War II history class with, had urged me to visit\
  \ the memorial. \n\n\u201CThere's nothing like it anywhere in the U.S.,\u201D he\
  \ said. \u201CIt kills me to say this, but we really could learn a thing or two\
  \ from the Germans.\u201D  \n\nThe concrete slabs, or stelae (stee-lee), at the\
  \ perimeter of the memorial were coffin-sized. Small children in brightly colored\
  \ winter coats laughed as they climbed over the slabs and chased one another around\
  \ them. \n\nI walked past the sign that read \"The Memorial to the Murdered Jews\
  \ of Europe.\" Direct and to the point, as Germans tend to be.\n\nWith each step\
  \ forward, the stelae increased in height. The tallest stelae were at least seven\
  \ feet high. No names were engraved on their surfaces. Exactly 2,711 of them swept\
  \ across the square like unmarked gravestones in a cemetery. The architect behind\
  \ the monument, Peter Eisenmen, had assigned no significance to the number. \n\n\
  The cobblestone path sunk and sloped downward. It gave the impression of an almost\
  \ gravitational pull towards the center of the memorial. The stelae gradually drowned\
  \ out the laughing children, the whistling birds and the heavy traffic that surrounded\
  \ the square. Soon I could hear nothing but the sound of my breath. \n\nAn old man\
  \ turned a corner and walked towards me. When we met, the narrow pathway forced\
  \ us to face one another as we sidled past each other with our backs against the\
  \ stelae. He was wearing a worn-gold Star of David around his neck. His sunken,\
  \ tear-filled eyes met mine briefly as he passed.\n\nI looked back and watched him\
  \ vanish behind the rolling gray maze just as quickly as he had appeared. \n\nAs\
  \ I ventured deeper into the memorial, there was an undeniable sense of isolation\
  \ and dread. Even at mid-day, a chilling darkness permeated the pathways. Sunlight\
  \ could hardly slip in through the looming concrete skyscrapers. \n\nHow much time\
  \ had passed?\n\nThe stelae cast long, suffocating shadows. They varied only in\
  \ height. They rose and fell to form a menacing concrete wave.\n\nJackson was right,\
  \ I thought. We may have museums with our dark history contained within their walls\
  \ - but we have nothing close to this magnitude. \n\nThis is the equivalent of a\
  \ \"Memorial to the Slaughtered Native-Americans\" spanning 200,000 square feet\
  \ across the National Mall in Washington D.C.\n\nThis is a \"Memorial to the Enslaved\
  \ African-Americans\" erected outside, in plain sight, dead center of Montgomery,\
  \ Alabama. \n\nSuddenly, the ground leveled out; I had finally reached the heart\
  \ of the memorial. I began to walk back up the inclining path. \n\nI ran my fingers\
  \ along the stelae as I navigated my way out; their gunmetal-gray surfaces were\
  \ rough and stinging cold to the touch. \n\nThe sky slowly opened up above me. Sunlight\
  \ warmed my face and hands as the stelae shrunk to six feet. Soon I could see over\
  \ them. Other visitors\u2019 heads poked out from the columns. We emerged in a daze,\
  \ stunned by the sudden sensory overload. \n\nI looked back at the sea of ominous\
  \ gray that had swallowed me up for what had seemed like an eternity. \n\nIs this\
  \ what it was like?\n\nLife on the outside had gone on undisturbed, but inside the\
  \ memorial, just moments ago, it seemed to have dissolved away entirely. There had\
  \ been only the endless grid of stifling alleys; only the feeling of powerlessness,\
  \ of being shuffled along by some unknown force from one dismal space to the next.\n\
  \nI let out a long, heavy sigh of relief. My breath crystallized in the air. I looked\
  \ around the square and watched the laughing children playing tag in the grass and\
  \ chasing each other around the stelae. The needles on the pine trees stirred in\
  \ the wind; small black birds cleaned each other\u2019s wings on their branches.\
  \ The afternoon sun beamed down from a cloudless blue sky. \n\nLife outside of the\
  \ memorial, somehow, had carried on."
