Text: "The road was long, much longer than I remembered. The old VW campervan was\
  \ without aircon and the heat seared. I looked around at the stricken countryside.\
  \ The earth was terracotta, with layers of grey ash. The smell was terrible. The\
  \ light burnt into my eyes. I imagined the retina melting. I could not keep my thoughts\
  \ from the people who died on this stretch of road. They made the awful choice of\
  \ whether to stay in their cars and die like fish in a kettle or to run into the\
  \ flames. The tears that welled up in my eyes were hot, steam tears.\_\n\nAs we\
  \ drove on, the road distorted in the heat, seemed to rise up before us, trying\
  \ to shake us off. The van, having purred across all of England, France and Spain,\
  \ started to judder and splutter.\n\nWe pulled off the road.\_ I saw smoke pouring\
  \ from the van\u2019s rear vents and grabbed the bag with our passports. I headed\
  \ as far from the van as I could. The smoke didn\u2019t stop. It engulfed the rear\
  \ end of the vehicle.\n\n\u201CWill the LPG tank explode?\u201D\n\nI looked at the\
  \ patch of rough ground we\u2019d pulled on to. It was scrubby, full of sharp shards\
  \ of glass and biting insects. I wished I\u2019d had more substantial shoes than\
  \ the ugly black flipflops I\u2019d picked up in a French supermarket.\_\n\nWe looked\
  \ around for water but there was none. My throat was parched, needles pricking my\
  \ tonsils.\n\nA water bottle had rolled under the passenger seat. We had to choose,\
  \ the van\u2019s thirst or our own? The water lasted nano seconds as it hit the\
  \ dry radiator and hissed at us, a paltry amount.\n\nI looked around again and noticed\
  \ a small cairn of stones and bits of car bumper.\_ The vines were black but intact;\
  \ perfect bunches of grapes hung from recently pruned stems. What happened here?\n\
  \nSpirals of new smoke were rising from the ash-covered ground around us like mini\
  \ tornados.\n\nA few cars passed by, the drivers stared. A police car did a u-turn\
  \ and I felt a sour mix of hope and fear as the driver leaned forward to look at\
  \ us. It slowly cruised past and disappeared over the hill.\n\nThe smoke from the\
  \ rear vents died down but flared again as we approached; we stepped back.\_\n\n\
  \u201CMaybe the fire extinguisher would stop it?\u201D\n\nA crazy swirl of foam,\
  \ the smoke subsided. I took a red triangle and walked along the roadside and placed\
  \ it carefully the required distance behind us. When I turned back to look it had\
  \ fallen flat.\_\n\n\u201CWe need to call breakdown.\u201D\n\nI flipped my phone\
  \ ready to dial.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s no signal.\u201D\n\nAs the sun dropped below\
  \ the surrounding hills the blackened tree trunks became silhouettes against the\
  \ grey sky. \n\nThe searing heat switched rapidly to chill. I shivered in my sleeveless\
  \ cotton and draped a towel over my shoulders. As the darkness fell a strange wind\
  \ whipped the dust at our feet. The sandy soil was abrasive.\_\n\n\u201CWe\u2019\
  re going to have to hitch a lift.\u201D \_\n\nThe cars had stopped passing without\
  \ us noticing.\n\n\u201CAre we near enough to walk to a bar?\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\
  \ wait, I\u2019ll cycle\u201D\n\n\u201CNo!\u201D I wasn\u2019t stopping there on\
  \ my own.\n\nAn hour later we were outside a small caf\xE9, the familiar Portuguese\
  \ hospitality kicked in. Wonderful food any time of the day at prices that made\
  \ us smile at the bill. We watched the glorious purple dusk. The van was dead, would\
  \ be towed back to the UK three months later. This part of central Portugal has\
  \ a healing property and we were healed, the horrible experience already felt like\
  \ something that had happened years ago not hours.  \nA year later and the land\
  \ was healing too. Already new growth painted the hills in myriad greens, the hazy\
  \ sun set the endless blue waters of the huge lakes alight. 62 people died on that\
  \ stretch of road in the horrendous wildfires in central Portugal, 2017. Those victims\
  \ would not be forgotten but the Portuguese are a resilient people able to pick\
  \ themselves up, dust themselves down and, like the land, start all over again."
