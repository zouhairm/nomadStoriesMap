Text: "I was sat on the U bahn on my way to see the Brandenburg gate, wearied and\
  \ lonely in the sprawls of Berlin. I wanted to play tourist for a while. There was\
  \ a comforting familiarity to this. Stations zipped past and people came and went.\
  \ (I find travelling on underground networks like travelling through the bloodstream\
  \ of a city, transporting people like oxygen to the body).\nMy journey was hindered\
  \ when an oldish man came to sit next to me. He was breathing heavily and muttering\
  \ under his breath. It was in German so I couldn\u2019t make it out which made me\
  \ feel uneasy. He stared at me intently with piercing eyes, fears began to fester\
  \ in my mind, probably stupid ones but my inner cocktail of disorientation and vulnerability\
  \ lead me not to trust him. I wanted to get off the train.\nAs we were pulling into\
  \ the next stop a strange thumping began to fill the carriage mimicking my inner\
  \ unrest. It was an all consuming thumping, strangely alluring, so strangely alluring.\
  \ I got off. I had no idea where I was...\nAs I walked up the station steps to the\
  \ exit, the sound became louder and louder. There was a strange kind of electricity\
  \ in the air and as I reached the top I was met by hordes of people. They were taking\
  \ part in some kind of protest. A ponytailed woman passed me bouncing, carrying\
  \ a sign \u2018Die stadt geh\xF6rt uns allen\u2019, the city belongs to us all,\
  \ I made out another one in the distance, \u2018F\xFCr buntes ein Berlin\u2019,\
  \ for a colourful Berlin. Everything about this protest was colourful.\nHalf the\
  \ people followed big trucks with blasting speakers as they danced down the street,\
  \ all to a similar beat. It was a raving procession,surging with the music. The\
  \ other half walked along, still bopping, sipping on glass bottles of beer that\
  \ would later be left neatly next to a bin so someone could sell them on. I felt\
  \ awkward at first, an 18 year old girl walking hesitantly on the sidelines, overcome\
  \ by what I had stepped into. I clutched my bag tightly. \nI think one couple noticed\
  \ this.They turned to me, welcoming me into the crowd. They smiled and I smiled\
  \ and then we began to walk and dance. They told me my bag was \u2018cool\u2019\
  \ but I couldn\u2019t hear much else. I could feel myself loosening, allowing myself\
  \ to be part of something bigger, trusting that not everyone was out to steal my\
  \ iphone.I was a young girl in the midst of vastness, but this didn\u2019t matter.\
  \ All of these people were just little people in the midst of vastness, but they\
  \ had a voice and a beat that they all moved to. I was learning to follow the churning\
  \ machine of the city. \nIt\u2019s slick, well oiled, a place where everyone waits\
  \ for the green man before they cross, a place where the bus doors close within\
  \ about 30 seconds. Everything moves like flickers of electricity on a circuit board.\
  \  This had felt cold and dystopian. But seeing the smiles on peoples faces I realised\
  \ that there was a strange kind of freedom in trusting it\u2019s mechanism. Like\
  \ the procession, it moves to a steady, all consuming beat. A desire for freedom\
  \ breathed through those streets like the techno sound people moved to. It seemed\
  \ that this was the freedom that walls could not contain. The bleakness of its history\
  \ has brought Berlin parading into its present and it\u2019s future. \nAfter stumbling\
  \ across this procession I too learned to trust the mechanism, trust in travel,\
  \ follow my nose and the beat and the people. \nI never did see the Brandenburg\
  \ Gate."
