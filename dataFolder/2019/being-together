Text: "I lived in Delhi-Sonepat Highway, the so called NH1. Believe me, it\u2019s\
  \ more boring that what it sounds. One find day, at my flat, there was a Notice\
  \ put up by the Residence Welfare Association about a 6 hours power cut. Being first\
  \ time to National Capital Region, makes me often wonder, what to do and what not,\
  \ as you don\u2019t know the city. Suddenly, my cell rang up. It was my childhood\
  \ friend. Thank God, you truly are omnipresent! I rushed to take bath and started\
  \ with no delay to Connaught Place. We finally met at Palaki Bazaar. It\u2019s quite\
  \ rejoicing when you suddenly meet your childhood friend at once; especially when\
  \ there is 6 hours power cut at your flat. My friend is very practical guy. Our\
  \ meet, mostly end up a monologue from his side towards life and inspirations, but\
  \ believe me, I love it and I live it to the fullest.\n\nFinally, he asked me if\
  \ I would like to drink tea. I\u2019m not much of tea guy previously, but Delhi\
  \ has made me one tea fanatic. He took me to the Chawri Bazaar to a shop, which\
  \ was too remote. I was very surprise by his choice initially, but when I drank\
  \ the tea, I knew, what it actually was! I have never ever in my life, ever drank\
  \ such tea. I have gone places and drank the so called \u201Cspecial tea,\u201D\
  \ but it was literally a special one. It is rightly said, sometimes, you don\u2019\
  t need any advice, a tea suffice to all. It stimulates everything inside you. If\
  \ it is good, its mind blowing and removes each and every thought process, and further,\
  \ above all, when it is with your best friend, it\u2019s just and Buddha Enlightenment,\
  \ the so called \u201CNirvana.\u201D\n\nWe ended up drinking more than two cups\
  \ of tea. When the tea is good, you can\u2019t remember the number of cups, and\
  \ especially when, your friend pays for it! We continued talking and this time,\
  \ the whole argument went about politics. It\u2019s quiet strange, we always start\
  \ taking about our own life and then end up discussing other\u2019s life \u2013\
  \ a phenomenon, so obvious, but never comprehendible.\nAlthough, I have spent many\
  \ a times with my many friends, but this turns out to be the best amongst those.\
  \ Precisely because, it gave me lot of optimism that was required by me for the\
  \ moment, especially when you stay alone for the first time. A small chit chat over\
  \ tea sometime, matters more than spending whole day, doing fun things, with hell\
  \ lot of good friends. I call it, \u2018The Tea Tweak of Optimism.\u2019 A lot of\
  \ things can happen over tea also!"
