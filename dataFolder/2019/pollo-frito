Text: "I got off the bus, leaving behind the relative familiarity of hot dogs in a\
  \ bag, upbeat Latin music, blasting air conditioning and new car small, and stepped\
  \ onto the radiating heat of a Managua sidewalk. I gripped my guidebook expectantly\
  \ and repeated the Spanish phrases I\u2019d taught myself from my brand new espa\xF1\
  ol-ingles dictionary to myself in my head. I\u2019d had plenty of time during the\
  \ 18-hour bus ride from Guadalajara to teach myself some new phrases. \n\nI walked\
  \ away from the setting sun, in the direction I had just mapped out for the fourth\
  \ time; right to the hostel, just around the corner. There weren\u2019t many other\
  \ people around, and certainly not any \u2018gringas,\u2019 foreigners, like me.\
  \ All the other travellers on the bus had gotten off in Honduras in an industrial\
  \ neighbourhood in Tegucigalpa, while the rest of, warned not to wander far, stayed\
  \ at the Holiday Inn beside the bus stop for the night and ventured to Pollo Campero\
  \ across the street for crunchy and comforting fried chicken. \n\nAs I walked the\
  \  residential street of Managua, I noticed eyes on me. Eyes from front stoops,\
  \ where a few people sat and drank, as music drifted from open doors. Eyes from\
  \ the occasional car that drove by. I checked \u2018the book\u2019 as my trusted\
  \ Lonely Planet had come to be known. It should be here. Right here. I ask a woman\
  \ on the street \u201Cdonde esta\u2026\u201D and she looks at me apologetically\
  \ with wide brown eyes. I understand enough Spanish to know that she knows the neighbourhood\
  \ but does not know of any hostel around here. And she hurries on, as the neighbourhood\
  \ grows darker, quieter.\n\nI circled a couple more times, walked past the small\
  \ bus station- just a stop, clearly- but it\u2019s now dark, shut, cerrado. Without\
  \ cell phone or internet connection, I\u2019m stuck. A man on his small lawn approaches\
  \ me, carefully. His two children are in front of him, used almost as a shield between\
  \ us. His house is glowing behind him, small, gated, full of green leaves, plants\
  \ growing, and his wife is there, and his voice is kind. He warns me it\u2019s not\
  \ a good idea to linger here. \n\n\u2018\xBFEst\xE1 bien?\u2019 I\u2019m not sure.\n\
  \n\u2018Perdido.\u2019 I\u2019m lost, I admitted. \n\nThe two young children are\
  \ fascinated by me and are smiling, glowing with laughter and curiosity, asking\
  \ their parents, both on the lawn now, question after question about me, pointing,\
  \ wanting to know where I came from with my big bag, my blonde hair, my tired eyes.\
  \ \n\nI asked about the hostel, about a taxi. The wife invites me in, tells me many\
  \ cabs aren\u2019t very safe in Managua, and indeed later I hear the stories from\
  \ other travellers. They call a family member, to try to get a car, to drive me\
  \ somewhere themselves. I can understand enough, and they talk slowly, for my benefit.\
  \ The boy and the girl are thrilled to have me in their home, and the wife asks\
  \ me if I\u2019m hungry. I realize and confirm that indeed, I am. The bus stopped\
  \ hours ago at a small spot on the side of the highway, a chance to stretch long-seated\
  \ legs and have some fried chicken and limp French fries. \n \nI learned their names,\
  \ all of us more curious now, feeling each other out. The boy and girl, Samuel and\
  \ Emi. The husband and wife, Franco and Ana.  My name is pronounced the way I\u2019\
  m coming to like hearing it, like the song it implies, shhhhan-tal and I smile.\
  \ They are \u2018de Nicaragua- aqui, Managua.\u2019 We eased into comfort as dinner\
  \ was prepared and the warm smells settled me. \n\nFinally the relative with the\
  \ car calls, they chat, and Franco tells me \u2018ma\xF1ana.\u2019  He will have\
  \ the car in the morning and can deliver me to the big bus station, to bring me\
  \ to San Juan del Sur, my destination. I\u2019m invited to stay in a small alcove,\
  \ on the couch. Fried chicken and rice and beans, freshly made, are softly placed\
  \ in front of me, and we sit down to eat. I smile, and this pollo frito is the best\
  \ yet."
