Text: "Arriving at a quaint cabin on the Oreagon cost in a little city Called Nesquin,\
  \ we excitedly ran through the house checking out the amenities and picking bedrooms.\
  \ The cabin was beautifully furnished in oversized chairs and loungers begging your\
  \ bottom to relax. The patio boasted a barbecue, and a porch swing with a sunset\
  \ view of the ocean, complete with the authentic sound of waves breaking on the\
  \ sand. Shortly after settling our things in place, we set off on our first adventure.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t sure at first which sight was more impressive, the instructor or\
  \ the ocean. As my cousin and I shifted glances between the horses, the surf, the\
  \ fog and our dreamy captain we drank in the refreshing foggy sea air. Our horses\
  \ were seasoned pro\u2019s, who enjoyed the surf breaking at their feet. It was\
  \ magical the way the fog broke and gave way to picturesque islands that emerged\
  \ from the cloud as we trotted by. \nAfter exploring the beach on horseback we were\
  \ ready to enjoy the water ourselves. A quick change of clothes and a short walk\
  \ from the cabin and we are on the beach. The fog burned off and we came across\
  \ a penguin in distress. After building a small cardboard shelter and calling a\
  \ wildlife officer the little guy was underway to recovery. Time for us to recharge\
  \ too. We drove into Lincon, about 20 minutes from Nesquin to do a little shopping.\
  \ We found beautiful little souvenirs, at a shop called Beachcombers. I even made\
  \ off with a life size stuffed orca and some dried seahorses for my friends and\
  \ family. Time for grub now! An hour from Licon is the major city of Portland, and\
  \ a place called Moe\u2019s that has been serving up seafood for a long time. Jumbo\
  \ Alaskan King Crab that would take up the entirety of the glass top nautically\
  \ themed scenes set into the wood of the tables. Being close to the ocean itself,\
  \ the freshness of the cuisine is reenforced with salty ocean mist drifting in.\
  \ A quick stop at the local aquarium and a visit with Keiko himself, the orca made\
  \ famous in the movie Free Willy, and our ocean themed vacation wrapped up nicely.\
  \ \n\n\n\nThis was a trip I took when I was 11 years old, I live in Canada in the\
  \ Rocky Mountains in a small town with many hot springs, lakes, hiking and off road\
  \ trails. We have impeccable skiing, with multiple ski hills less than an hours\
  \ drive. It\u2019s incredible to enjoy the comforts of a place like Whistler with\
  \ the lines ups of a small town. There is no overcrowding, very reasonable prices\
  \ and tons of places to explore. I love it here, and could speak to the wonderful\
  \ places to visit from natural waterfalls to underground mines and old railways\
  \ to explore. We are also fortunate in that one of the first roads ever created\
  \ in the Area, the Dewndy Trunk Trail runs through land we own and ends at a local\
  \ heritage town called Fort Steele. From fishing to big game hunting, boating, we\
  \ really have it all. On second thought, don\u2019t come here, I like the clean\
  \ air and no line ups :)"
