Text: "The age of the iguanas\n\nIn this story there are more than eight hundred iguanas\
  \ and one man. The man is sixty years old, but he appears to be younger. The iguanas,\
  \ on the other hand, appear to be the age of the world. The man's name is Ram\xF3\
  n Medina Archundia, and he was once a mechanic. The eight hundred iguanas are of\
  \ the species \"Iguana iguana\", or common green iguana. Since 2010, it is a species\
  \ subject to special protection by the environmental authorities of Mexico, the\
  \ country where this story takes place.\n\nThe man and the iguanas coexist in a\
  \ property, of thousand square meters, in which grow six leafy trees next to a small\
  \ house. Between the branches of each of the trees they inhabit more than a hundred\
  \ animals. The iguanas almost overflow from the treetops, but they do not leave.\
  \ Ram\xF3n Medina also decided not to leave. This man prefers to live with iguanas\
  \ before with other men. That's why he turned his house into a sanctuary for reptiles.\
  \ And here, the iguanas raised their own kingdom.\n\nThis unique sanctuary is located\
  \ in Manzanillo, a port located in western Mexico, 120 miles from Puerto Vallarta.\
  \ It is known as \"Iguanario Archundia\u201D. \n\nEvery morning, after the sun rises,\
  \ Ram\xF3n opens the front door of his house and prepares to go in search of the\
  \ 350 kilos of food a day that the iguanas require. He climbs into his modest truck\
  \ and drives to the city market. The merchants of the small market donate the fruits\
  \ and vegetables that the iguanas will eat during the day. It is not fresh food,\
  \ but it does cover the nutritional needs of iguanas. After touring the market,\
  \ a couple of hours later, Ram\xF3n returns home carrying a gigantic salad in his\
  \ truck: withered lettuce, bruised papayas, mashed bananas, broken watermelons,\
  \ damaged mangoes, and rotten tomatoes. This colorful mix of fruits and vegetables\
  \ is placed in the iguanas' feeding trough. People can see the iguanas, descending\
  \ from the branches of the trees in a hurry, running over, when the food arrives.\
  \ This is how the world should have looked when the reptiles dominated the earth.\n\
  \nRam\xF3n told me that everything started more than forty years ago. He was a teenager\
  \ when he rescued an iguana meant to be his grandfather's lunch. Ram\xF3n felt sorry\
  \ for the helpless animal, so he decided to take the iguana before his grandfather\
  \ cut his head and threw it into the pan. He healed the little beast from its wounds\
  \ and released it under the shade of one of the trees in the backyard. From then\
  \ on, the iguanas would go to the backyard and never leave. Over the years, the\
  \ reptiles would dominate not only the trees, they also occupied the walls and roofs\
  \ of the small house. Since then, huge and fat iguanas sunbathe on the walls of\
  \ the house. They are like living gargoyles.\n\nOn Sundays in the morning, the day\
  \ that Ram\xF3n's family usually has breakfast under the shed, the iguanas usually\
  \ approach, expectantly, to look at that rare ritual that humans have when they\
  \ eat. It's an almost surreal scene: a family sitting at the table, surrounded by\
  \ hundreds of iguanas.\n\nRam\xF3n says that the average age of these iguanas is\
  \ 5 to 8 years. \"If you add the age of all the iguanas, it results in several thousand\
  \ years,\" says Ram\xF3n. Millennia of animal life are concentrated in this small\
  \ space. It is a small Jurassic park, growing, pulsating in the heart of this city\
  \ located in the tropics of Mexico."
