Text: "Butt clenched like a fist in my seat and right hand compulsively cupping my\
  \ outer thigh to find the reassuring bulge of my phone in my pocket, I muttered\
  \ to myself, \u201Cwhat\u2019ve you gotten into now?\u201D The newish black-but-dusty\
  \ Hyundai was pushing night-covered desert quickly past my window. I could only\
  \ see the first few hundred metres of sand and rock before the high-beams\u2019\
  \ light suddenly evaporated through bristles of dust. My mind was left to fill in\
  \ the restive darkness with monsters and ISIS. \u201CThis is fine,\u201D I tried\
  \ to console myself. \u201CThis is fine.\u201D \n\nAn hour earlier I had been in\
  \ Israel with a friend, crossing the Wadi Araba border into Jordan by foot. Passing\
  \ out of Israel we walked along the border fence, chuckling at the \u201CWelcome\
  \ to Jordan\u201D sign with the \u2018L\u2019 dangling upside down. This minor imperfection\
  \ eased the tension that arose from standing on a dirt track with literal minefields\
  \ on either side. Signs in three different languages implored travellers to refrain\
  \ from crossing the fence, please, lest they turn themselves into shawarma. \n\n\
  On the Jordanian side, there was a single chatty immigration officer processing\
  \ a short line of foreigners. He was flirting with the women and trash-talking with\
  \ the men. He tried to bait me into arguing with him about Australia\u2019s 0-1\
  \ football defeat to Jordan that week. I wasn\u2019t biting, so he stamped my passport\
  \ and waved me on to the next window.\n\nMy friend and I got talking to some others\
  \ waiting in line. There was an Italian and a Mexican, who were married, and a Brazilian-American.\
  \ All were friendly and funny, a winning combination. The Brazilian mentioned he\
  \ was hiring a car in Aqaba, just over the border, and offered for us all to join\
  \ him on the drive to Wadi Musa, where Petra is waiting to be \u2018discovered\u2019\
  \ on Instagram. Not hesitating to consider that we were in the Middle East and it\
  \ may have been potentially precarious to get into a car with complete strangers,\
  \ we agreed to tag along.\n\nSo, I found myself in that Hyundai, flying through\
  \ a Jordanian desert dreamscape in darkness. Grinding my teeth as we slid around\
  \ curling, unlit roads, I tried to gauge how everyone else was feeling. One was\
  \ fast asleep, and the others seemed relaxed. I started to realise that the hunting\
  \ shadows outside our car probably weren\u2019t ISIS but projections of my own neuroses.\
  \ Many chewed nails, checkpoints and missed turns later, we pulled safely into Wadi\
  \ Musa.\n\nThe five of us spent the next few days travelling around Jordan together.\
  \  We visited the ancient Nabatean city of Petra, a relic of architecturally skilled\
  \ caravanning nomads. The sun-embattled rocks and sand crunched underfoot like granola\
  \ and sweet milk.\n\nThe group grew as we met people along the way. We all travelled\
  \ to Wadi Rum, a big red desert where Bedouins took us hurling around sand dunes\
  \ in the back of a ute and barbequed dinner in an underground cooking apparatus\
  \ called a Zarb. I was promised we were not served anything from the minefield at\
  \ the border. \n\nThe morning this whole dizzying circus was to come to an end,\
  \ the Brazilian with the Hyundai mentioned that he had another rental car parked\
  \ in Taba, in the north of Sinai, which he had to return to Cairo within the next\
  \ four days. Would any of us be interested in coming with him to Egypt? Four of\
  \ us selflessly volunteered to return to the limits of our comfort, the shadowy\
  \ area of our worlds that was slowly receding with every pita filled with mystery\
  \ meat.\n\nWe knew there was some ISIS was only a few hundred kilometres north of\
  \ where we would be driving. We crossed back into Israel, then into Egypt, climbing\
  \ into the parked rental near the border to begin another foolhardy journey, all\
  \ of us relative strangers. It was hard to tell if this was personal growth through\
  \ the unknown or reckless stupidity. It was probably both. Heart fluttering in my\
  \ chest like a caged parrot, I tried to check my phone less often than the first\
  \ ride. \n\n\u201CThis is fine,\u201D I told myself. \u201CThis is fine.\u201D"
