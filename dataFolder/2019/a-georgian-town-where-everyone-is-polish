Text: "Making a local connection - a Georgian town where everyone is Polish\n\t\n\
  My mom has been organizing our mother-daughter trips since I was ten years old.\
  \ Now I\u2019m twenty-four and we still travel together, sharing a friendship, similar\
  \ temperaments and lifestyle preferences. One of our unspoken rules is to be thrifty,\
  \ not risky. For example: use a public bus whenever you can, but don\u2019t hitchhike\
  \ or take hitchhikers. During our 2018 trip to Georgia, we broke both of these rules.\n\
  \tWe only visited Akhaltsikhe (a name I learned to pronounce, but which spelling\
  \ I still need to double-check), because it is the best place to spend the night\
  \ if one wants to see a cave monastery of Vardzia. Our accommodation was situated\
  \ opposite Rabati Castle, but we did not count on having time to see it. Marshrutkas\
  \ (minibuses) to Vardzia departed only a few times per day, and not exactly in convenient\
  \ hours.\n\t\u201CPoland, Polska?! My grandmother was from Sucha Beskidzka!\u201D\
  \ - in recent years, Georgia experienced a real boom of Polish travelers, possibly\
  \ thanks to cheap airlines flying there. We were not surprised to hear that a taxi\
  \ driver recognized our language at the bus station, but he took us aback by mentioning\
  \ the name of a small mountain town. Only a Polish grandmother could make him remember\
  \ the name of \u201CSucha Beskidzka.\u201D What were the odds?\n      He insisted\
  \ on driving us to our accommodation for free because he loved his grandma. It was\
  \ a three-minute ride, during which he used all of his marketing skills to convince\
  \ us, that taking a marshrutka to Vardzia would be a waste of time. My mom bargained\
  \ a bit for fun. After three minutes, I realized that we broke our \u201Cno-taxis\u201D\
  \ rule and that we were all set to go with him to Vardzia the next day.\n\tOur host\
  \ greeted us with a bottle of sweet wine, which we drank with fellow Poles, who\
  \ stayed the next door. One could meet Polish compatriots everywhere in Georgia,\
  \ but we rarely had time to make friends, because my mom is famous for overpacking\
  \ travel itineraries with sightseeing plans (according to my fianc\xE9, I inherited\
  \ this trait). But this time, we ordered a taxi and did not have to wake up for\
  \ the minibus! We were drinking wine with Szymon and Ma\u0142gorzata until 2 AM.\
  \ We ran out of our two bottles by 10 PM, but Szymon purchased a 2-liter plastic\
  \ bottle of homemade wine the other day. \u201CWe really have to drink it. We travel\
  \ with carry-on luggage, so we can\u2019t fly this bottle to Poland!\u201D By the\
  \ end of the night, we convinced them to share a taxi to Vardzia with us. They never\
  \ used taxis either, but alcohol encouraged everyone to be luxurious.\n\tA trip\
  \ to Vardzia took over an hour and our driver made a point to teach me Russian by\
  \ the time we reach our destination. After I learned a word for \u201Chydroelectric\
  \ power plant\u201D (which we passed on the way), we spotted two hitchhikers in\
  \ the middle of nowhere. Our taxi could fit six passengers, and that couple looked\
  \ like they had no idea where they were going, so the driver pulled over. Of course,\
  \ Beata and Piotr had no idea where to go (to Vardzia, which they would not reach\
  \ by foot), and, of course, they were Polish. We all spent an intensive, fun day\
  \ together: sightseeing Vardzia, another cave monastery, and a small castle. We\
  \ came back in time to visit Rabati castle as well. \nI grew fond of new traveler-friends,\
  \ but I knew such friendships don\u2019t last. Moreover, Beata and Piotr lived in\
  \ the UK, Szymon and Ma\u0142gorzata in Pozna\u0144, Poland, and I was going back\
  \ to Chicago. Still, I and Beata became facebook friends and, soon enough, real\
  \ friends. We text regularly about almost everything, while my mom stayed in touch\
  \ with Ma\u0142gorzata.\n\tBy sunset, everyone was on their separate ways. My mom\
  \ and I went to the supermarket. \u201CPoland, Polska?! My grandmother was from\
  \ Sucha Beskidzka!\u201D - exclaimed the cashier, who did not look related to our\
  \ taxi driver at all. The \u201CSucha Beskidzka\u201D marketing technique made us\
  \ four new friends that day, though!"
