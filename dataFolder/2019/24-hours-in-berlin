Text: "On a trip to Abu Dhabi, I found myself with 24 hours to enjoy Berlin. This\
  \ was my first time in Berlin. My oh My, was it a good stopver? Berlin is an eclectic\
  \ city mix with art, culture and history. I stayed at Sofitel Berlin Kurfuerstendamm,\
  \ an elegant 5 star located in the heart of City west, in the immediate vicinity\
  \ of the legendary shopping street Kurfurstendamm. The hotel was so amazing. Immediately\
  \ I dropped my bag at the hotel, I wanted to see everything so I did what every\
  \ tourist does, I hopped on the sightseeing tourist bus. \nWe drove through the\
  \ Brandenburg gate. Brandenburg gate is one of Germany\u2019s most iconic landmark.\
  \ What a stunning architecture, Its an old city gate and was rebuilt around 250\
  \ years ago. I visited the Holocaust Museum, the holocaust memorial in Berlin is\
  \ a memorial to the jewish victims of the holocaust designed by architect Eisenman.\
  \ The Holocaust museum is a memoir to the fallen also known as the memorial to the\
  \ murdered jews of europe. According to the architect who designed it  \"the memorial\
  \ is meant to evoke an unease and confusion\"\n \nFrom the Holocaust museum , I\
  \ wandered to the Checkpoint Charlie, Checkpoint Charlie was the crossing point\
  \ between east and west Germany during the time of the berlin wall. If you want\
  \ to see the original building head to the Allied Museum for a more intimate look.\
  \ After a wander around at checkpoint charlie, it was time to check out Friedrichstrabe.\
  \ Friedrichstrabe is one of the best shopping streets in Berlin. I loved the selection\
  \ of shops in the shopping galleries and malls. My favourite is Galleries Lafayette\
  \ which is incredible.\n\nI wanted to see more but it was time to meet up with friends\
  \ for dinner at SRA BUA  Restaurant by Tim Raue. SRA BUA is a modern Asian restaurant\
  \ with European flair. Food was very delicious, service was very personable and\
  \ friendily. The interiors of the restaurant is luxurious and modern. During dinner\
  \ I had a glass of Beer. How can you not drink beer when you visit Berlin Lol!\n\
  \nWhat more can I say? Berlin really surprised me. \n24 hours in Berlin was not\
  \ enough to explore Berlin. It was time to leave Berlin, but with a firm resolution\
  \ to go back and explore this magnkificent city. \nI cant wait to be back and  explore\
  \ more sights like the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, berlin zoo, berlin catherdral\
  \ etc and explore the food scene"
