Text: "The mighty Himalayas and their charm. One voyage to the mountains lets you\
  \ forget everything.\nMy story began from Lachen,  North Sikkim at 9000 ft . It\
  \ is the nearest tourist accommodation to Gurudongmar Lake at 17800 ft, which is\
  \ 68 kilometers and 3 hours away. \nGurudongmar Lake\u2014 Source of the mighty\
  \ Teesta river, this high altitude lake is perched on a plateau by the side of Kanchengyao\
  \ mountain range. Special permits are required to visit this holy lake which can\
  \ be organised by any of the  Sikkim tourism tour operators in Gangtok.\n\nLachen\
  \ was beautiful and calm. Hotel Apple Orchard in Lachen is one of the finest hotels\
  \ you can stay at, with wooden cottages and top notch service. \nOn my visit to\
  \ the market, a day before my trip; a lady shopkeeper told me the story of the mountain.\
  \ The legends have it that the region was once parched, and the lake remained frozen\
  \ all year. If you visit the lake now, even in winters, you will find a tiny spot\
  \ that stays unfrozen! As for its mystery, the locals believe that Buddhist Guru\
  \ Padmasambhava, also a renowned tantric, touched the very spot and blessed it to\
  \ remain unfrozen to make life easy for the people around. Believe it or not, visitors\
  \ as well as the locals vouch for the existence of a tiny, unfrozen corner, even\
  \ in the harshest of winters. \nNext morning at 5:00 am, I left Lachen. \nOne after\
  \ the other, four cars left for Gurudongmar, the lake that I had only seen in the\
  \ pictures. Fifteen minutes into the journey, the roads have shed all their niceties\
  \ and I find myself jumping like a popcorn. The milky Lachen Chu is flowing happily\
  \ alongside, cutting through the ridges. Snow peaked mountains teased at a distance\
  \ and at every curve the \u201CWOWs\u201D got a little more prominent. Jagged mountains\
  \ kept company with waterfalls pitching in every now and then.\nThe road went from\
  \ bumpy to bumpier. But Mother Nature was balancing it out. For every bump there\
  \ was a carpet of purple primulas spread over. As far as the eyes could see, tiny\
  \ primulas looked like purple stars spread over the green.\nTwo hours and 4000 feet\
  \ higher, we stopped at Thangu for breakfast at a small restaurant run by Pema and\
  \ Doma, two efficient sisters who dished Maggie, tea, omelettes to tourists.\nAs\
  \ the journey to Gurudongmar lake continued, the green cover slowly started diminishing\
  \ but the river never left us, first roaring, then bubbling, then gurgling. Clouds\
  \ replaced the trees and the landscape slowly turned rugged as we entered the alpine\
  \ zone.\nThere were hardly any people to be seen, just army jawans and check posts\
  \ at regular intervals. At 15000 ft, we reached an army base camp where there were\
  \ convenience facilities, a cafe, medical assistance and a bunch of enthusiastic,\
  \ ever helpful jawans.\nThe landscape was breathtaking now, a little bit of Ladakh,\
  \ a little bit of Spiti and a little bit of Sikkim. Miles and miles of  only mountains,\
  \ clouds and gorgeous blue skies. \nWhile one mountain was milky white, another\
  \ was like black forest pastry and another was a brown velvet carpet.\nWe were 9\
  \ kms away from the lake and suddenly, the ride felt smoother. \nMy heart was fluttering\
  \ now. The destination was minutes away.\nThe car off roaded and started ascending\
  \ on a hillock, coming to a halt after five minutes. And there it was. Behind an\
  \ array of parked vehicles. \nGurudongmar lake: A majestic frozen beauty. \n80%\
  \ frozen, covered with a sheath of ice, 20 % water glistening in the sun, the reflection\
  \ of the sky on the lake. \nWith just 3% oxygen and gaining an altitude of 9000\
  \ ft in 4 hours, walking at a regular pace was uncomfortable. Breathing heavily,\
  \ I stood on the edge, gazing at the surreal view. The wind blew and the multi-colored\
  \ prayer flags danced."
