Text: "The need for information. The right for information. This way Journalism was\
  \ born, relatively a new profession and area of acting that structure in true, fact-checking,\
  \ editing, examination and other aspects that forms the journalist, as well as the\
  \ social commitment of the profession, which goes far beyond just informing.\n\n\
  In United Kingdom it is not different. In 1922 a British Broadcasting Corporation\
  \ (BBC) was founded, an English public broadcaster of radio and television that\
  \ has a big reputation worldwide. BBC, which is popularly known, is nowadays the\
  \ most important communication carrier in the region, specially in London where\
  \ is the company headquarters.\n\nThe collaborative journalism and the participation\
  \ of the public in the construction of the news are the base of their work and content\
  \ products, principles hardly seen in newsrooms these days.\n\nThe company was born\
  \ in a context of autonomy and free of political positioning. BBC does not have\
  \ a private financing but rather a public financing that influences in the content,\
  \ news, programs and all that the communication vehicle publishes. With budget paid\
  \ by those who have a TV set, this British broadcaster stands out for its independence.\n\
  \nProducts like documentaries and hard talk interview program show how the company\
  \ walk together with a public opinion and participation and forms a conjunct action\
  \ with a society and power structures to express liberty and search for the truth.\n\
  \nThe company gets to rule also histories and narratives that are not common in\
  \ big companies of journalism like The New York Times in EUA, Le Monde in France\
  \ or even Globo in Brazil. BBC shows its force when leads the public to a quality\
  \ journalism and products that include new tools. One example is the documentaries\
  \ that rely on interview, images, videos, audios, depoiments, fixing a complete\
  \ material to catch the public up and encourage the participation in the construction\
  \ of the news.\n\nIn formation of BBC, the journalism yet was a social institution\
  \ and a public service, pint that explain how the company and its history developed\
  \ based on this conception. This is the action motivated by common good, public\
  \ interest and consensus.\n\nBBC surpassed the politics representants and revel\
  \ a neutral position, the objectivity, considered the basic aspect of journalism.\
  \ Born in this moment a new perspective of a profession and acting area.\n\nMost\
  \ of this English company has references in a posture of their professionals. In\
  \ this context, hard talk is a interview program that makes the participant confused\
  \ and the objective is putting it in contradiction, an important example of the\
  \ plight with the truth, investigation and a good canvass.\nThe not politics stance\
  \ of communication company gets to itself credibility to act like protector of society\u2019\
  s interests. The audience look this like a form of confidence and preserve their\
  \ social role.\n\nIn this logic, journalism is an environment of debate subjects\
  \ and to access the public scope, allowing that people have a voice and can charge\
  \ their rights. This allows calling the media as the fourth power.  \n\nThus, since\
  \ the first radio news bulletins, almost 80 years ago, BBC News has become the first\
  \ place people turn to during big news events, like wars and festivals, using resources\
  \ and techniques to enrich their work and performance.\n\nThe bulk of programming\
  \ comes from the news centre in Television Centre, West London, the largest operation\
  \ in the world. Political programming, including the BBC Parliament channel, is\
  \ based in the heart of Westminster at Millbank while international radio programming\
  \ comes from the home of World Service, Bush House in central London.\n\nThe company\
  \ does not produce the BBC's UK regional news programmes and services but works\
  \ very closely with BBC Nations and Regions across all media to ensure that they\
  \ reflect the diverse picture of life in communities throughout the UK.\n\nSo, please\
  \ note that current journalism faces a great challenge with the great amount of\
  \ content published by anyone who wants to produce. After all, as has already said\
  \ George Orwell \u2018\u2018Journalism is to publish what someone does not want\
  \ to be published. Everything else is publicity\u2019\u2019."
