  \ next. Her boyfriend just broke up with her and she starts to question everything,\
  \ leading her to a small degree of depression. \nAs her senior trip her parents\
  \ let her go to a trip to Netherlands that she payd for. Maya expects to find love\
  \ but struggles with her independent side telling herself she does not need anyone\
  \ but herself. She is at the tulip garden thinking about what to do when she trips\
  \ and falls into the tulips.\nShe remains unconscious for a bit but then as she\
  \ wakes up and rises from the tulips she finds that she is bo longer in Holland.\

  \ its a dream she tries to go back to sleep when she hears whistling. She sits up\
  \ and sees an elf. Confused she asks where on earth she could be. the elf corrects\
  \ her saying its not earth but theart. Maya tells the elf that she wants to go back\
  \ home and the elf says he doesn\u2019t know how to send her back, however if mother\
  \ theart called her that means Maya could not go back until theart believed she\
  \ was ready to do so. \nThrough Maya learns she needs to love herself and stop trying\
  \ to be such a perfectionist. Through learning to love and appreciate herself. She\
  \ also learns it is okay to let people into your lives and it is also okay if they\
  \ leave. \nOnce Maya has learned this she is compelled to to back to the tulips\
  \ where she first arrived from to say thank you to mother theart. As she said thanks\
  \ she decided to sleep in the tulips when the next day she finds herself back to\
  \ Holland just as she left it. Estatic she runs back home early and does some changes\
  \ around her way of life, promising herself she would never forget her adventures\
  \ at theart."
