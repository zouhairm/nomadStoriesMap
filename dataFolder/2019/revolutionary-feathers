Text: "We rode rickety bicycles through backyards thick with grass. I swatted at midges\
  \ nipping my calves while trying to keep pace with my casa particular host, Reinal.\
  \ I\u2019d arrived in Vi\xF1ales planning to get an early night and spend the next\
  \ day exploring the tobacco fields on horseback. Instead, we\u2019d shared a rum-soaked\
  \ evening playing dominos and discussing Cuban-American relations. He criticized\
  \ the numerous touristic clich\xE9s of Havana, and lamented the artificial impression\
  \ it left on visitors. When I agreed with his perspective, he suggested we postpone\
  \ the horseback riding for something more authentic. He didn\u2019t mention what\
  \ I needed to be prepared for, but it didn\u2019t matter, I was ecstatic: here was\
  \ my chance to see a different Cuba. \n\tAs we slipped through a morning mist further\
  \ away from the valley, I began to realize this wasn\u2019t a typical bike tour.\
  \  \n\t\u201CThe chicken is the fiercest animal in all of the land.\u201D He shouted\
  \ into a headwind. \u201CIn your country, it\u2019s over-farmed, over-eaten. Here,\
  \ we respect it. The mother raises her chicks by herself, then she pecks at their\
  \ head until each one leaves\u2014alone. When they return, brothers fight brothers.\
  \ Hasta la muerte. Valiente, como los revolucionarios.\u201D \n\tReinal knew this\
  \ was the final leg of my ten days in Cuba. He seemed intent on ensuring that I\
  \ would return to California branded by his hyperbole. \n\t\u201CSure, Havana is\
  \ one of the seven prettiest cities in the world, but nowhere else on earth has\
  \ mountains like in Vi\xF1ales.\u201D\n\tWe arrived at a small compound where I\
  \ was immediately hit by a stench of feathers and cigarettes. A group of men were\
  \ gathered around a small thatched-roof arena secured by mesh string along the sides.\
  \ Stacks of cages housed squawking chickens who seemed to sense what was coming.\
  \ One man held two roosters upside down by the legs while another wrapped cloth\
  \ around their talons like prized-fighters\u2019 fists. I kept my distance and shot\
  \ Reinal a look. Either he didn\u2019t notice my discomfort, or it was precisely\
  \ why he\u2019d brought me here. In any case, he paid me no attention, instead examining\
  \ the neck of one of the chickens, then stroking its feathers with the back of his\
  \ index finger. \n\tThe trainers signaled for me to step into the arena. In over\
  \ three years living in countries with bullfighting, I\u2019d never once considered\
  \ attending, repulsed by the idea. The forced violence made me uncomfortable, but\
  \ so did the thought of offending the men by backing out. I stepped to the far corner\
  \ and leaned against the wall, watching as the trainers followed inside and closed\
  \ the gate. An older man with no front teeth refastened the cloths along the talons\
  \ of one chicken, ensuring they were taut. This was just a training session: they\
  \ wanted blood, not death. \n\tThe two birds were placed in the dirt, both stood\
  \ motionless, each eyeing its opponent. When the old man clapped, one of them shrieked\
  \ and exposed its surprisingly agile body. The other flapped twice, rising off the\
  \ ground before striking with its beak. Flecks of blood stained their pristine white\
  \ feathers. The battle continued, and with every blow, the old man shouted, \u201C\
  Asi es!\u201D\n\tThe injured chicken fluttered up and down, attempting to attack\
  \ with its sheathed talons. It was pecked out of the air each time.\n\t\u201CAsi\
  \ es.\u201D\n\t\u201CAsi es.\u201D\n\t\u201CAsi es.\u201D\n\tA smile grew on the\
  \ old man\u2019s face as he scooted forward, separating the animals when it was\
  \ clear who\u2019d won. He collected the victor, wiping away the blood with a rag,\
  \ stroking his feathers in congratulations. I hurried out of the dark ring, anxious\
  \ to return to the beaten path. Reinal joined me in the soft rain and placed his\
  \ hand on my shoulder. He lit a cigarette and pointed to the winner. \u201CHe\u2019\
  s a true Cuban, a great champion. He\u2019s ready to fight.\u201D\n\t\u201CAnd that\
  \ one?\u201D I asked, nodding towards the losing bird. \n\t\u201CHe\u2019s ready\
  \ to die.\u201D"
