Text: "At happened me in the middle of February, that I have been in Lebanon, more\
  \ specifically in Beirut, the capital, walking along the streets. How did I, young\
  \ girl appeared in this Arabic country in winter time? I want there to explore other\
  \ cultures, nations and human-beings within a meeting of youth workers. So, I have\
  \ already had quite some experiences behind me. I have visited some places the capital,\
  \ I have been talking with local people around finding, if they are proud to their\
  \ country, and I have been exploring such a different setting on my own. I have\
  \ met many outsiders, many kind and strange people. I have visited a refugee camp.\
  \ But what I have been most driven to, was talking about taboos in this society.\
  \ \n\nFirst, this is always interesting point in discussing with anybody. Second,\
  \ I have no idea, what to expect getting from people living in society, where social\
  \ injustice, gender imbalance and arranged marriages are standardised, accepted\
  \ and proved. My and my two friends, we have more than one hour long walk toward\
  \ our accommodation, so we started to talk. We shared our insights about our passed\
  \ experiences first. But than we started to challenge each other in sharing secrets.\
  \ In sharing those buzzard pieces of information, we would rather to keep for ourselves.\
  \ Topics were truly very diverse. And for most of the time we end up talking about\
  \ sex. \n\nIn the middle of busy streets of Beirut. Passing other people who might\
  \ or might not understand our conversation in English. Yes, there were putting their\
  \ sights to us. But it might be, because obviously we did not belong to their society\
  \ for the first sight. Yet nobody ever noted or mentioned anything to us. Just sometimes,\
  \ some people smile to me of my friends or laugh. I do not know, why or what. But\
  \ I can fur sure tell, that talking about such a private and delicate topic on public\
  \ with people I have barely known was deliberation. Fearful, difficult, extremely\
  \ ashamed sometimes, but I felt like a rebel doing this in the middle of the country,\
  \ when even lovers or husband and wife do not talk about at all. \n\nWhen we were\
  \ starting our journey, I did not expect to find such an understanding and such\
  \ an openness. I was surprised, amazed, flattered. I can state after this experience,\
  \ that I was a different person. With a different point of view to myself, with\
  \ some new trustworthy friends. With a new level of compassion toward this yet strange\
  \ and distinct culture, as Arabic world can for me, from a central Europe be. And\
  \ at that spot I realised, that those are the gates toward synergy, to share about\
  \ all those deep and dark truths, we all have. To find out, we all are just humans\
  \ sharing those same emotions and insights about ourselves and our lives."
