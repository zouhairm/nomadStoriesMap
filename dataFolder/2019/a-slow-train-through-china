Text: "It was July 2015 in Shanghai. The eve of a 16-hour train journey to Guangzhou\
  \ \u2013 my first and last in basic economy class. The weather was humid, muggy\
  \ and made my thinnest t-shirt stick to my torso like a second skin. The clouds\
  \ overhead were smudged silver over an orange pastel canvas.\n \nThe expedition\
  \ through the waiting room, down onto the platform and finally onward to board the\
  \ train was an obstacle course of humans and luggage. Bags and holdalls were squeezed\
  \ into cellophane corsets. Legs acted as hurdles. Steamed pork dumplings and crispy\
  \ duck produced an enticing aroma on the unconditioned air. Incoherent music from\
  \ phone loudspeakers answered each other in a disjointed group sing-a-long. Groups\
  \ of young children giggled and failed to discreetly take a picture of the only\
  \ western person in their midst. Me.\n\nThe stainless-steel snake came, filled its\
  \ bowels with passengers and moved off again within minutes. The carriage was a\
  \ series of banks with six-seats in each; three facing forward, three backwards.\
  \ There were no tables and very little leg room for a five-eleven man with fairly\
  \ longish legs. The seat had a blue paisley print cover with an embroidered antimacassar\
  \ bearing the company logo. With the aid of my iPod and a book, the journey could\
  \ be completed hassle free. I immediately realised upon seating myself why the reservation\
  \ had been so cheap. The covering was flimsy and thin, concealing a steel frame\
  \ with no cushioning of any kind. \n\nThe hours slipped by whilst the sun outside\
  \ retreated beyond the horizon and the world beyond the windows finally dissolved\
  \ to black. The fluorescent strip lighting came on overhead. And then the pleasant,\
  \ somewhat uncomfortable journey thus far descended into an unforgettable night\
  \ (and early morning). \n\nPeople began singing loudly in their own little groups,\
  \ the phone loudspeakers started up again. A woman slouched in her seat and swung\
  \ around to put her feet up on the wall. When I took a toilet break, I became aware\
  \ that squatting toilets were selected over traditional bowl types. So ensued my\
  \ best surfer impression as I relieved myself messily into a metal hole with an\
  \ audience watching through a constantly opening and closing sliding door which\
  \ had no lock. God forbid if I\u2019d wanted to go number two!\n\nEventually, the\
  \ lights in the carriage extinguished just short of midnight, ending all the madness\
  \ and bringing silence on the carriage. Temporarily anyway.\n\nSometime later, a\
  \ bright light hit my eyes, forcing me to squint and squirm like a newborn coming\
  \ into the world. A glance at my watch told me it was 1:30 am. All around me other\
  \ passengers were waking up groggily but with a strange calmness and anticipation.\n\
  \nThe ticket attendant appeared in the gangway. Music began playing loudly over\
  \ the tannoy. He held a giant cucumber aloft to rapturous applause and collective\
  \ laughter. To accompany this, he brandished a shoebox-sized pencil sharpener and\
  \ like a showman, he began \u2018sharpening\u2019 until serrated cucumber shavings\
  \ began materialising. The pieces he laid over passengers\u2019 faces as a beauty\
  \ treatment which incited further merriment. I had unconsciously stepped into the\
  \ unknown and was now living in a dream. I\u2019d never seen a spectacle like it.\n\
  \nAlthough the performance ended shortly afterwards, this was only act one. On the\
  \ second occasion, an hour later, a bag of triple use phone cables was thrust in\
  \ my face. And again, an hour later, my leg was being knocked into the other after\
  \ I dozed off. Children\u2019s spinning tops were now on offer. I couldn\u2019t\
  \ criticise the perseverance, only the timing. The routine continued twice more\
  \ before dawn, whereby I was propositioned with tureens of dried fruit and steamed\
  \ Goubulis.\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say after arriving six hours later in Guangzhou\
  \ that the whole experience was a learning curve. China had always fascinated me;\
  \ the culture and its people, and this was just part of it. I\u2019m now more open-minded,\
  \ a trait I probably owe to this train journey. It was a leap into the unknown complete\
  \ with language barriers and culture shocks. And yet, I\u2019ve been on the lookout\
  \ for a giant pencil sharpener ever since."
