  -styled dinner laugh if I told everyone that I played basketball with senior Hong\
  \ Kong citizens in a basketball court in Kowloon City. Now, granted, ten years ago,\
  \ being a miniature vermin with a sky-high flat top, playing ball using a worn-down,\
  \ rimless basketball system makes this Hong Kong fever dream seems like a terrible\
  \ airball.  \n \nI was a sophomore at Lawrence University when I was given the opportunity\
  \ to travel to Hong Kong to study sustainability and urban planning. Opportunities\
  \ like this came rare so the idea of being on an airplane for thirteen hours seemed\
  \ bizarre. And in fact, it was. Now, I'm not the one to focus on race and politics\
  \ when entering on a plane, but I can count the number of African-American people\
  \ with one hand, including the ones who joined me on the trip. But that being noticed\
  \ didn't match the anxiety of staying on a plane for thirteen. straight. hours.\n\
  \nThe neon lights corresponded with the vivacity of people walking both ways down\
  \ Kowloon Street. My camera served as my vessel to capture the variegated billboard\
  \ lights, the local street vendors designed with luminescent colorful bulbs, and\
  \ concrete smothered by the intentions of feet and strollers going past and forth.\
  \ The Midnight In Paris-like stroll through Hong Kong led me to a near-vacant basketball\
  \ court where two elderly Hong Kong residents passing the ball to each other, running\
  \ up to the rim, and making their shot.\n\nSo in my head, I'm like cool, I'm from\
  \ the hood, I'm Michael Jackson- no, Jordan. I'm black. Tonight, I'm gonna let stereotypes\
  \ work in my favor. I treaded to the two men and decided to play a one-on-two game\
  \ against them, mind you my pride and my ageism definitely blinds me from the athleticism\
  \ of these two citizens. Their alley-oops were dangerous. Ball fakes after ball\
  \ fakes. Three pointers looked like first-grade algebra. To swallow my pride, I\
  \ decided to take a picture holding the basketball with one of the elderly men.\
  \ Outside, my jealousy forced a smile next to a five-foot-two Hong Kong citizen,\
  \ but inside, I realized: I just played basketball in Hong Kong, the city that inspired\
  \ Blade Runner. I can get dunked on all I want back home, but nobody can dunk on\
  \ my experience."
