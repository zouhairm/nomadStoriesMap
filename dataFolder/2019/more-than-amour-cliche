Text: "So I was thinking this trip was gonna be kinda basic but who could blame me!\
  \ Besides a lackluster desire to learn a new language, the only reason I chose France\
  \ was cause I was too lackadaisical to scroll down far enough and pick the U.K..\
  \ Plus, it\u2019s Paris for Christ sakes, the tourist capital of the world! What\u2019\
  s the old saying again, \u201Cwhen in Rome do as the Romans do\u201D. I wonder if\
  \ that was coined by a Parisian? Anyway, the experience was a wholesome one; cafes,\
  \ French bread and lots of cheese. I saw the Louvre , rode a moped, and I, of course,\
  \ saw the most grand daddy of all touristy things ever, the Eiffel Tower. Heck,\
  \ I even rode a bullet train out to the countryside! None of these, However,  gave\
  \ me the gratitude I embody for France now. I soon fell in love with a concept deeper\
  \ and more fruitful than all of that. Not the type of love that comes and goes but\
  \ the type that\u2019s infinite like spacetime or an endless buffet. Like a wave\
  \ crashing at my toes on the shores of the English Channel, I was engulfed in a\
  \ whole new scene that opened my eyes for the first time. In fact that was the first\
  \ time I had left the tri state area, all three being Texas obviously. I felt totally\
  \ embraced by the locals as if I was being consumed in the warm embrace of my grandmother\
  \ who passed. I felt totally enveloped  by the culture, the people, and the food\
  \ especially, that I forgot where France ended and I began. It was almost as if\
  \ that was were I should have been all along. That\u2019s probably why cliche means\
  \ \u201Cfor something to lose its original meaning or effect to the point it becomes\
  \ meaningless\u201D. I completely lost my notion of what I thought it was or what\
  \ it was supposed to be and in doing so I found France."
