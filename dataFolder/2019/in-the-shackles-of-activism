Text: "I live my life shackled by activism. \nAware of the 13th amendment\u2019s exception\
  \ maintaining slavery within prisons, my desire for justice of people of color in\
  \ the United States has grown fonder from constantly being engulfed in anger. My\
  \ knowledge on why the exception was established is not immense, but I plan to acquire\
  \ a theory throughout my college years. \n\nBorn into a poor white family in Salem,\
  \ Oregon, as a mixed black woman, the stigma of being different struck me like a\
  \ bullet. I was thick-haired, thick-skinned, rocking a gap between my teeth, and\
  \ Goodwill shoes on my feet. At school, I couldn\u2019t stand a chance. I was bullied\
  \ into isolation, originating a passion of my own: Justice. Despite house transitions\
  \ and poverty, I never let go of my desire to restore justice in the black community.\
  \ \n\nMy drive to end the main component of systemic racism originated when I was\
  \ fourteen years old, finally embracing my roots. Accessing facts of black family\
  \ and ancestors being tormented by their own homeland enraged me enough to try and\
  \ put a halt to it. I scrolled through social media and discovered hundreds of different\
  \ branches of feminism, eventually landing on a piece of my passion: feminism for\
  \ women-of-color. I did a particular amount of research, enlarged my eyes, expanded\
  \ my heart and education on racial injustices, and never went back. I educated hundreds\
  \ on the internet about covert racism in our laws, gave public speeches, and shared\
  \ rhymes that I wrote whenever a black person died in the hands of law enforcement\
  \ to city crowds. Every high school elective I took educated me on government policy\
  \ and current affairs. I watched the 13th documentary, and came to the conclusion\
  \ that the 13th amendment exception will be my #1 issue to focus on, since it does\
  \ the most damage in many areas. I am now 18 years old, preparing to render my theory\
  \ on the reasoning behind the kept loophole, on the TED stage in hopes to commence\
  \ a revolution; a change in the Constitutional amendment, and a change in our prison\
  \ system. \n\nI have traveled from poverty, to the dreamer\u2019s stage, and am\
  \ currently aboard the train to success. Bound to these chains of racial inferiority,\
  \ I cannot escape! I will not escape until I change this! All I need is the opportunity\
  \ to achieve full liberty and justice for all. All I need is this opportunity of\
  \ a lifetime to spread awareness of the corruption within the United States Judicial\
  \ System."
