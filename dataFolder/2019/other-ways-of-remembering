Text: "There are times the body demands movement and the mind must listen. One afternoon\
  \ in Thailand, my body pulled me outside. I spoke to no one as I flew from the classroom,\
  \ feet crunching on the pebbles while I walked towards the stairs and up to the\
  \ fourth floor to change my clothes. Descending, I surveyed the row of bikes clustered\
  \ by the staircase, each standing upright but not much better than that. Tires wilted,\
  \ cobwebs clinging to the handlebars, they were a motley crew from which I selected\
  \ the strongest among the bunch. Grabbing it, I mounted and rode away as that tension\
  \ unwound from me in the wind I left in my wake.\nAll day, the sun had waged against\
  \ us, a small group of students and our professors sequestered in a classroom. Even\
  \ in our shelter of the house and with the barest of movements  \u2013 an arm drifting\
  \ back and forth as my hands inscribed notes \u2013 the heat enticed sweat from\
  \ my pores. Yet, I urged my legs to pump the bike forward, the sun could not daunt\
  \ me. After a full day of academic lectures, muscles coiling tighter with each hour,\
  \ putting my feet on pedals of a bike triggered a mental release.\nI pushed my way\
  \ up the winding inlet and out onto the street, making a turn right before the corner\
  \ store and down a country road that always framed the setting sun at the end of\
  \ the day. It didn\u2019t take long before I came upon a field. The road narrowed\
  \ into a bridge that revealed a field of dirt at the beginning of the semester.\
  \ Now, I looked out on sprouting grass that hid rice beneath. I slowed and pulled\
  \ to the shoulder. My fingers inched toward my phone, almost without prompting from\
  \ my mind. As I passed houses or people on the road who acknowledged me with a smile\
  \ or head nod or some such gesture, I wished for a camera. And I dwelled again on\
  \ what I\u2019d been noticing since the beginning of my trip: that I instinctively\
  \ wanted to clasp onto what I found interesting, intriguing, and beautiful.\nThis\
  \ tendency wasn\u2019t new. Just as it was not new, the yearning to feel, to know,\
  \ and to hold was as universal as a baby whose tiny fists open and close to grasp\
  \ a shiny toy held in front of their faces. As I pedaled onward and came to a field\
  \ of sunflowers, I knew the vibrant petals were no shiny toy. But I found some part\
  \ of me reaching out and grasping just as if I had been a baby, perplexed by the\
  \ unknown, yet desirous to hold it with me forever.\nI suppose that\u2019s why I\
  \ wanted my camera. With an adequate lens and a couple gigabytes of space, I could\
  \ contain the mysteries my mind could not solve or hold firmly in the moment. The\
  \ camera yields a concrete mold into which we pour abstract emotions: joy from the\
  \ head thrown back in laughter; love in the unshed tears of a groom; and tenderness\
  \ within the pores and wrinkles that traipse across every person\u2019s face. I\
  \ knew this as I passed an alleyway down which I could see children dancing and\
  \ laughing. I recall that moment with uncertainty, though, because I refused to\
  \ take a photo, wanting instead to try inscribing the image into my own memory.\
  \ The ride that day eased my tension as much as it tested a theory about other ways\
  \ to remember, which worked in part. \nWe can write. We can paint. We can speak\
  \ to each other of the experiences in our lives that will cling to us even as we\
  \ move on and have more. These methods may require greater focus and time than we\
  \ possess or are willing to spare. And in the end, they may create a depiction even\
  \ hazier than the photo we can snap in an instant. Yet we can use these approaches\
  \ to piece together a depiction of the human life akin to the blended, blurred,\
  \ yet brilliant images of the Impressionist movement. It is not quite a replica,\
  \ but a representation."
