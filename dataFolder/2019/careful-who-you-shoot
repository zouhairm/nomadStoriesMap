Text: "I've been summoned. And it's for all the wrong reasons.\n\nI know my ears are\
  \ crimson. They're burning despite the cool breeze that slips through the narrow\
  \ lanes leading from the piazza. Rushing blood drowns out the trill of an accordion,\
  \ ice chinking against glasses filled with Aperol, a cacophony of conversation in\
  \ more languages than I can decipher. He's looking right at me. I spotted him as\
  \ we were leaving the Pantheon, forging a path between jolly Americans and wilted\
  \ British tourists, the breeze giving no respite inside the great marble dome. His\
  \ burgundy beret sat neatly atop, contrasting his khakis and the dilapidated ochre\
  \ fa\xE7ade behind him. It's ideal, I need characters to bring the images to life.\
  \ \n\nI was aiming for his profile, candid, authentic. All the things street photography\
  \ is supposed to be. Instead, he and his comrade are waiting for me to cross the\
  \ divide, disapproval marring his otherwise serene expression. Shaking his head,\
  \ he steps toward me. I've realised my mistake, adrenaline triggering an internal\
  \ battle. Should I run? Seems unlikely they'd use their assault rifles to stop a\
  \ person fleeing after capturing a photo. I decide to stay. \n\nBack home in Sydney,\
  \ we don't have military personnel manning public spaces. No large rifles resting\
  \ by their side as they stand to attention in the corner of city squares. We're\
  \ disconnected from the world, too far to feel the threat of terrorism on our doorstep.\
  \ But this is Europe. More people, more places, more opportunity for risk. My intentions,\
  \ although endearing, have ignited a reflex. Do they suspect I'm a spy? A rather\
  \ awful one if I were. A young woman, mousy hair streaked blonde, freckles bright\
  \ after a week in the sun. My floral skirt and sandals hardly seem suitable attire\
  \ for anyone but a tourist. He has a job to do, and I've interrupted it.\n\nIn a\
  \ few strides he's here. He couldn't be more than 20, not much younger than me and\
  \ only a few inches taller. \n\n\"Show me the camera,\" he says, his accent emphasising\
  \ the 'e' in camera. \n\nI quickly hit the playback button and delete the last image\
  \ as he looms over me. I'm too quick, he wants to see more. I scroll through the\
  \ images. First forward, the vivid colours of Burano and weathered doorways of Venice\
  \ flashing across the small LCD screen. Then back again, fountains and markets,\
  \ churches and cobblestone streets. No trace of him remains on my memory card. He\
  \ looks at me dubiously, eyes quizzically searching for a sign of dishonesty. I\
  \ didn't expect to find myself fearing a night in an Italian gaol. Alas, here I\
  \ am. \n\nMaybe he's going to confiscate my camera, or delete all the images on\
  \ the card, as a precautionary method. Losing it would be like losing a limb, or\
  \ an eye. My camera is an extension of myself. I don't explore without it. A safety\
  \ blanket for solo travel, giving me purpose and direction, comfort in my own company\
  \ through assignment. It's this very companion that gave me away. I wasn't the only\
  \ one taking photos, but it's professional body and telephoto lens don't afford\
  \ me the cover of being inconspicuous. I'm in the crosshairs.\n\nHis eyes soften,\
  \ shoulders dropping slightly. \n\n\"No photos,\" as he shakes his head. \n\nI nod\
  \ in agreement. My pulse steadies, heart no longer trying to escape its bony prison.\
  \ He turns, quickly taking up his post in front of the faded ochre building again,\
  \ eyes focussed ahead, still and straight. \n\nFinally, aware I've escaped a night\
  \ in a cell, I twist and begin to weave through the swarms of people toward Piazza\
  \ Navona. I will need new characters for this story, preferably less of the national\
  \ service type. I resolve to spend the next few days shooting street performers\
  \ and local vendors, avoiding another run in with the authorities. This was not\
  \ how I had anticipated my first afternoon in Rome."
