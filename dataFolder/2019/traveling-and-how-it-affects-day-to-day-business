Text: "A man once asked me, \"What is the most critical piece of advice you would\
  \ give me, if you could only give one?\" I said travel! He stared at me with a sense\
  \ of perplexity. I then proceeded to explain.\n\nA few years back I got on a plane;\
  \ not thinking anything by it. I would travel all throughout Colombia. Being a young\
  \ single female, brought much concern for many individuals. For me, it was a sense\
  \ of freedom and exciting new cultural experiences ; that many pass by. Since that\
  \ day I've traveled throughout Australia and Europe; along with countries in the\
  \ Caribbean . I've learned 5 valuable traits and I want to share these with you.\n\
  \n1. Becoming more Social\n\nThe more you travel, the more you are pushed to engage\
  \ with others; rather it be for communication, business or personal reasons. You\
  \ are involved and interacting in ways you've never known before. You're learning\
  \ a new language, a new way to do business, or perhaps you're learning about ideas\
  \ for your next business that haven't even been exposed to your country.\n\n \n\n\
  2. Becoming more open-minded\n\nYou know that awful food you saw on the food network?\
  \ You find yourself eating it and loving it! You know that hostel you thought you'd\
  \ never sleep at? You're staying there and realizing what you have back home that\
  \ you have been taking for granted. But the funny part is, you actually enjoy the\
  \ lifestyle and the humility it brings with it.\n\n \n\n3. Becoming more grateful\n\
  \nYou find yourself in a sense of awe. You realize what you have as well as what\
  \ you could have. You step back from reality just to see the comparison of all diversities.\
  \ You blend what was with what can be. You start to see business ideas and concepts\
  \ in a whole new light. You go home with a sense of gratitude you can apply to your\
  \ work place and environment.\n\n4. Becoming more confident\n\nThis is probably\
  \ my favorite attribute I have gained from traveling. Once you learn that anything\
  \ is possible and everything happens for a reason, you can start to take things\
  \ down a notch. You start learning that when you travel , things do not go as planned.\
  \ You have to go with the flow of life at times. You learn to control what you can\
  \ and to also let certain things take the course they are destined to run. You become\
  \ more confident in your decisions which enables you to step up and take on leadership.\n\
  \n \n\n5. Becoming more knowledgeable\n\nAm I the only one who saw this coming?\
  \ Traveling gives us a well rounded sense of knowledge on so many levels; culture\
  \ being a critical one. When you can learn to understand how people think all around\
  \ the world and why, you can then become an experienced asset to your company. Your\
  \ way is not the only way and more often than not, it is not the best way. You learn\
  \ to listen. You can take in knowledge from all over the world and then learn to\
  \ implement your own process. It truly is a beautiful experience to look back on\
  \ and see how far you've grown.\n\n \n\nI challenge you to take a trip to somewhere\
  \ you've never thought of. Where have you been that has changed your perspective\
  \ on life?"
