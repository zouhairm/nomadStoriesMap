Text: "I guess we should have known better when the driver leaned across the rifle\
  \ lying on his passenger seat to invite us into his car. We should have known that\
  \ the inevitable result of hitch-hiking across northern Iraq would be kidnapping\
  \ in Kurdistan\u2026\n\nHassan was a young peshmerga (Kurdish soldier) driving home.\
  \ He couldn\u2019t speak English but he read in Arabic the name of our destination,\
  \ the Yazidi temple at Lalish, and off we went, speeding along the new roads that\
  \ twist through the desolate mountains, only breaking for occasional army checkpoints.\
  \ \nAs we progressed the cliff walls seemed to get tighter against a narrowing road.\n\
  \nCommunication was a bit difficult as, knowing only the words for \u201Cvery good\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cthank you\u201D, I can express a pretty limited range of ideas in Kurdish.\
  \ The conversation, such as it was, took a surreal turn when Hassan handed me a\
  \ message on his phone which said we should kiss a million times \u201Cand when\
  \ we\u2019re through / let\u2019s start again and kiss anew.\u201D I looked up at\
  \ Hassan who was beaming and nodding. \u201CVery good\u201D I said, and \u201Cthank\
  \ you.\u201D\n\nHassan indicated that he wanted us to come to his for lunch. Behind\
  \ the baked clay walls of his family compound we were warmly greeted by a combination\
  \ of brothers, black-clad wives and kids. We sat on the floor together while a delicious\
  \ seven-dish lunch was served on a communal plate, falafel, foul, hummus, salad\
  \ and endless freshly baked bread... \n\nSeveral hours later we tried to depart\
  \ for the temple. That was when we discovered we\u2019d been kidnapped - by hospitality.\
  \ The nature of the hospitality kidnapping is that your kind host is so insistent\
  \ you stay that it becomes almost impossible to leave. Hassan and family spent an\
  \ hour using every means available to keep us there, pleading, miming sleeping,\
  \ trying Google Translate, even phoning an English-speaking friend in Baghdad. I\
  \ thought it was just a matter of time till he forced us to accept further hospitality\
  \ at rifle-point.\n\nEventually, a deeply reluctant Hassan accepted we were going.\
  \ But very generously he insisted on driving us to Lalish temple, the Yazidis\u2019\
  \ holiest site.  \n\nYazidism has its roots in ancient Mesopotamian religions that\
  \ predate Christianity and is considered by Islamic militancy to be Satanism. The\
  \ Yazidis worship a peacock called Tawuse Melek, who refused to bow to Adam out\
  \ of love for God, mirroring Satan\u2019s behaviour in the Qu\u2019ran. \n\nLalish\
  \ was home to a 12th century saint who is worshipped as an incarnation of the peacock\
  \ angel. Pilgrims here pass through marble halls covered with carved peacocks and\
  \ snakes to find the saint\u2019s tomb, buried within cool caverns, and then tie\
  \ a knot in the brightly coloured silks draped over it, whilst wishing for some\
  \ blessing. I followed suit praying for safe travels on our hitch-hiking trip that\
  \ would, God willing, take us from Iraq back home to Liverpool just before Christmas.\n\
  \nMy prayer was answered but tragically many of the wishes of the Yazidi pilgrims\
  \ for their own lives were soon to be destroyed. ISIS\u2019s rise saw Yazidis subjected\
  \ to a campaign of rape and murder that brought this obscure religion to worldwide\
  \ attention. That ISIS was stopped was thanks largely to the efforts of peshmerga\
  \ like our friend Hassan. \n\nWe left the temple to find him waiting patiently outside,\
  \ ready to drive us 200km out of his way back to Dohuk. Upon arrival we said tearful\
  \ farewells, but Kurdish hospitality did not end there. Strangers treated us to\
  \ eight cups of tea. Our dinner came with five extra free dishes. Back at our hotel\
  \ the owner refused to accept payment for our stay, arguing \u201Cyou are guests\
  \ in my country, I cannot let you pay.\u201D I tried to explain the weaknesses in\
  \ this business strategy for a hotelier, but he waved my protestations away.\n\n\
  Apparently in the time of the great medieval adventurer Ibn Battuta, travellers\
  \ were so rare, and hospitality so great, that people could go to other countries\
  \ without needing money. In Kurdish Iraq it seems this is still true. What can I\
  \ say except Kurdistan is \u201Cgelek horsha\u201D (very good) and a heartfelt \u201C\
  s\u2019pas\u201D (thank you)."
