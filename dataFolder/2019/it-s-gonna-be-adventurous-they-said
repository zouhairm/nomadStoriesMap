Text: "Locals said that people with babies do it often, but I didn't believe them\
  \ so much. My husband Max saw the poster advertising the 4 days 3 nights Komodo\
  \ trip on the second day of our stay on Gili Island, Indonesia in one of the local\
  \ \"travel agencies\". And straight away he told me with the look full of excitement:\
  \ \"We have to do this. It's once in a lifetime experience.\" I said no\u2026 Meanwhile\
  \ our 6 months old baby Nina was sleeping in her stroller. \n\nI'm not a boring\
  \ person. During our very first trip together we have crossed 4500 m Laurebina pass\
  \ during 9 days hiking in Nepal, without even having a guide or porter (Nepalese\
  \ guy who would carry our stuff to the top) with us. I also was brave enough to\
  \ climb a cliff in China on my 5 month of pregnancy (well, it wasn't so high). But\
  \ this time he was proposing me 4 days on a quite small boat with no hygiene facilities,\
  \ with 28 strangers in the middle of nowhere with our 6 months old baby... it sounded\
  \ crazy to me. But later I changed my mind. \n\nMany tourists we met during the\
  \ trip were truly excited about this \u2018cruise\u2019. So Max proposed me to go,\
  \ again. \u201CMaybe it\u2019s not such a bad idea.\u201D \u2013 I thought and we\
  \ made this leap into the unknown. \n\nThe boat was white and clean, spacious enough\
  \ for 28 people plus a crew, with some kind of a small kitchenette and toilet, and\
  \ two nice open decks at the front part to chill on. It was an adventure from the\
  \ very beginning. We had a cabin right above the engine, so it was really hot and\
  \ loud, with the annoying smell of fuel. Members of the crew were also smoking all\
  \ the time and you could smell it everywhere. We started our trip by crossing Alas\
  \ Strait \u2013 really fast stream, so the pitching was really strong and the best\
  \ option was to lie down and try to sleep. After everything calmed down, I woke\
  \ up from the heavy smell of fuel, so we decided to try to sleep on an upper deck\
  \ - right under the stars. Nina\u2019s night sleep was perfect on the boat, thanks\
  \ to the gentle and not so gentle swaying, I guess.\n\nThe other night Max woke\
  \ me up and said that I have to go and see an erupting volcano. Whaaat? We have\
  \ been passing the uninhabited island with the volcano spitting out lava from its\
  \ muzzle. The third night was calm - we slept on a boat with engines being stopped.\
  \ Some of the crew guys were not sleeping - they were trying to catch us some lunch\
  \ for the next day. My romantic husband went to watch the stars again and got a\
  \ grilled squid on the way back from one member of the crew. It was the most remarkable\
  \ seafood meal I have ever had. \n\nMany nice things happened, thanks to that boat.\
  \ I saw the most incredible marine life, when we were sailing along the Rose beach.\
  \ All the corals and fishes looked very close. I was so scared to disturb the beautiful\
  \ and harmonious life of these fabulous creatures! Baby Nina watched her first sunset\
  \ on a boat in Flores Sea waters with mom and dad and a lot of other happy people\
  \ around. We were swimming in a 100m depth ocean waters, watching mantas and touching\
  \ huge human size turtles. And dragons \u2013 Varanus komodoensis, also known as\
  \ the Komodo monitor, is species of lizard found in the Indonesian islands. It is\
  \ the largest living species of lizard, growing to a maximum length of 3 metres.\
  \ Nina and I recently have read a book about the animals of the world. And in the\
  \ reptilian section, there was it - Varanus komodoensis. I wonder if she remembers\
  \ that those are the ones she has seen on Komodo island. I'll try to find it out\
  \ after couple of years."
