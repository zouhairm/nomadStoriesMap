Text: "Dear Italia,\n\nYou surprise me, yet again, with the meandering beauty of Shakespeare\u2019\
  s fair Verona \u2013 the quaint setting of Romeo and Juliet \u2013 a town where\
  \ lovers aimlessly stroll through open piazzas hand-in-hand.  Ironically the very\
  \ privilege denied our famed Shakespearean couple, whose love demanded a pardon\
  \ from a century old grudge connected to birthright, not merit.\n\nDespite a dual\
  \ death ending, a romantic folklore began around 1972, claiming those unlucky in\
  \ love who touched the bronzed heart of Juliet would forever change their fortune.\
  \  A pastime so popular the statue actually had to be replaced.  These pilgrimages\
  \ became the fodder for the 2010 release of 'Letters to Juliet', a movie inspired\
  \ by the real-life 'Juliet Club' which replies to letters from forlorn lovers from\
  \ all over the world.  \n\nNow it\u2019s my turn.\n\nI arrive at the gates of 'La\
  \ Casa di Giulietta' equipped with a pen and harmonica, in case my Romeo needs a\
  \ little help finding his way.  I walk through an arched entranceway covered in\
  \ graffiti with post-it notes and letters shoved between the cracks of a stone wall\
  \ leading to a courtyard.  There right in the middle, gleaming in the afternoon\
  \ light, stands Juliet.  Next to her is a middle-aged man with his arm wrapped around\
  \ her back and a hand cupping her breast.  He smiles at his wife looking like a\
  \ schoolboy who just coped his first feel.  Meanwhile, a swarm of other people wait\
  \ in a half moon circle for their turn to do the same.  \n\nEventually, I solicit\
  \ an Italian woman to take my photo posing with a harmonica between my hand and\
  \ Juliet\u2019s heart. \u201CPerfectoooooo \u2026 rub it, girl!\u201D she teases,\
  \ and in this moment it clicks.  The sonnet I've been composing for days in my head\
  \ completes itself and hurriedly I walk into the museum to commit it to page.  Removing\
  \ my pen, I step to a podium that has a book opened to a blank page and start writing:\
  \  \n\n \"Dearest Juliet, where do I begin? \n  Standing hopeful under your balcony\n\
  \  scribing a letter for a love wherein\n  new life is breathed \u2013 divine harmony.\
  \ \n  \n  A flickering dance ignited by two \n  heartbeats in accord, vibrating\
  \ off each\n  other, challenging, complementing. Few\n  attune to such frequency;\
  \ many preach.\n \n  O my Romeo where art thou hiding? \n  Tis cruel to leave me\
  \ alone for this long\n  roaming the earth, where art thou residing?\n  Solo, erratic\
  \ beats that seem all wrong.\n \n   Be kind, make haste, and show thy face, a plea\n\
  \   for reciprocity, sweet melody.\u201D \n \nOnce completed I ascend the stairs\
  \ reading enlarged excerpts from Romeo & Juliet along the way.  Before reaching\
  \ the balcony, I read: \u201CIt is the east, and Juliet is the sun! Arise, fair\
  \ sun, and kill the envious moon.\u201D   Boldly, I pull out my harmonica stepping\
  \ forth to play a little diddy for my Romeo just as another person below reaches\
  \ for Juliet\u2019s heart.  [insert video]  \n\nLaying Tracks,\nAmerica"
