Text: "Bruce arched his eyes above his trademark white rimmed glasses, and a kind\
  \ smile stretched across his face. 'I think the boys have earned the chance to have\
  \ some fun, don't you Jo?' he said to his wife, whilst looking out onto stretches\
  \ of Australian countryside. \nMe and my best friend Chris had been working in the\
  \ small town of Colac near Melbourne as part of the WOOFING programme, where you\
  \ help locals in exchange for food and accommodation. We quickly realised we had\
  \ squandered a worrying portion of our time and money sampling the local nightlife\
  \ and slurping cheap wine from metallic bags. We reached the point where our finances\
  \ were looking dire, leading us to sustain ourselves by any means necessary. \n\
  Colac was a place that reminded me of the dusty hinterlands that the first tourists\
  \ from the west must have encountered; misty sun drizzled streets laced with varnished\
  \ saloons and whisky soaked anecdotes. Having suspected to be greeted by a lumbering\
  \ farmer tasking us with cleaning out sodden chicken coups, we were pleasantly surprised.\
  \ When we first walked into their home, the obligatory marriage photo you would\
  \ expect was nowhere to be found, and in its place was a picture of Bruce and Joanne\
  \ posing in the Pakistani mountains. As I eyed up the photograph, Bruce leant over\
  \ and span some fascinating tales about buildings rattling from car bombs in the\
  \ towns that he had stayed in, and witnessing TNT blowing up through mountain tunnels.\
  \ One already had the sensation this would be a pleasantly unconventional stay.\
  \     \nIn between a generous helping of cigarette and wine breaks on the porch,\
  \ even though my personal experience with this field of work had merely been glaring\
  \ at my father dutifully positioning his bird houses in Yorkshire from one corner\
  \ of the lawn to another, I like to believe we took to the tasks with youthful vigor.\
  \ We had summoned all of our slumbering testosterone to negotiate stubborn roots,\
  \ spools of rustic metal, and avoid lurking huntsmen spiders.\nIt was after spending\
  \ several days dismantling a gargantuan fence, that Bruce informed us of our next\
  \ task. This was to be the day of the bonfires. We scuttled out early from our bedrooms\
  \ like field mice to collect our materials. As we gathered spindly pieces of wood,\
  \ there was something oddly ritualistic about the affair, as if we were ancient\
  \ scavengers celebrating the oncoming of spring. As the meandering horses looked\
  \ on, we took photographs with our burgeoning piles like trophies. One picture with\
  \ us both in comically sized straw hats looking back at the camera in front of the\
  \ fire could have definitely been used for a future folk album. After setting up\
  \ the bonfires across the many acres of dry turf, we began to hurl the fire lighters\
  \ like confetti through the air. At first we stood back with pride, and reveled\
  \ in the spiritual connection we had concocted between modern and primal man.\n\
  That's when things started to escalate. The lashing flames started to trickle higher\
  \ and higher into the thick air, and before we knew it, our frail sense of control\
  \ had unraveled. Ravenous fire balls shot up the gaunt white gum trees with ease;\
  \ clusters of branches burst and crackled. Future news stories flashed through my\
  \ mind; talks in the town of pyromaniac Pommies. Through the swirling chaos, we\
  \ heard an Australian shriek of 'What the hell have you done boys!' and turned around\
  \ to see Bruce's large frame sprinting towards us with jugs of water, frantically\
  \ trying to douse out the fire, along with our sense of smoldering incompetence.\
  \ \nBack at the house, we gazed at the grey ribbons of smoke that were the legacy\
  \ of our latest work. Joanne informed us that she had mistakenly thought that bonfires\
  \ were allowed that day, when they were infact not because of the heat, so we were\
  \ grateful that only our trust was broken and not the law. That was the day we almost\
  \ went from bonfire to bushfire. I had once again proved my proclivity for disaster,\
  \ and ensured building small garden walls out of bricks would be my speciality for\
  \ the remainder of our stay."
