Text: "I put one foot in front of the other, keeping a slow rhythm between the crunch\
  \ of my boots on the wet gravel, my slow and labored breaths, and the beating of\
  \ my heart. I looked up to see the crowds lingering at the top of the mountain,\
  \ the high altitude, 8 km trek being no detterent to folks looking to get a snap\
  \ of Peru's Vinicunca, the Rainbow Mountain, for their Instagram.\n\nTime for one\
  \ last break before continuing to the top. I stopped and called down the mountain\
  \ tauntingly \u201CYou sure you're doing okay, Michael?\u201D\n\nMichael, an energetic\
  \ boy of 19, looked even younger from 100 meters ahead. In his New Balance sneakers\
  \ and jeans, he was surprisingly sure of his step on the wet ground. His 30-year\
  \ old uncle, Giovanni, trudged alongside him, carrying one of my hiking poles that\
  \ he had made fun of me for bringing earlier. \n\n\u201CYou've got proper shoes\
  \ on!\u201D he yelled up at me. \u201CThat doesn't count!\u201D\n\nI reached the\
  \ peak soon after, taking in the views of...well, of nothing. A heavy fog fell over\
  \ the valley, and the snow covered the Rainbow Mountain in a blanket of white. Just\
  \ our luck. Michael and Giovanni joined me at the top 10 minutes later, and we laughed\
  \ at the irony of our monochromatic view of the mountain.\n\nI had met Michael and\
  \ Giovanni in my hostel in Cusco, Peru. They were from Bogot\xE1, Colombia, taking\
  \ a trip together to celebrate Michael\u2019s recent entrance to university. The\
  \ next day after our disappointing climb to Vinicunca, we set out to Machu Picchu\
  \ together, spending two days walking along the train tracks and up the stairs.\
  \ We then had to part ways\u2014while I was privileged enough to be able to continue\
  \ my travels throughout Peru, Michael had to get back to school and Giovanni had\
  \ work. Before we said goodbye, however, they urged me to make my way up to Colombia\
  \ to visit them.\n\nAfter hiking and eating my way through Peru, I landed in Bogot\xE1\
  \ about a month later. \u201CYou look a little more gordita,\u201D Michael told\
  \ me in good humor as he opened the door to his home. He introduced me to the rest\
  \ of his family\u2014his mother, father, and chihuahua named Candy\u2014and we talking\
  \ and sang and laughed throughout the night.\n\nThe next day, Michael and I set\
  \ out to take on Montserrate, the 3,150m hill towering over Bogot\xE1. Though there\
  \ was a funicular that could take us up, Michael and I opted for the hike, 1,500\
  \ stairs that would take us right to the top. I had read online that it was supposed\
  \ to take up to 2 hours to complete\u2014Michael insisted that it took him less\
  \ than an hour. Seeing how he had been trudging behind me at Vinicunca, I had my\
  \ doubts. \n\n\"You'll see, Raneem.\"\n\nWe began our race at 9 am. Though we started\
  \ off at the same pace, Michael quickly overtook me and stayed about 15 steps ahead\
  \ of me the whole time. \u201CI\u2019m taking in the sights\u201D I yelled as I\
  \ took a much-needed breather on the side of the stairs, leaning against a wall\
  \ that was obstructing the view. \u201CYou\u2019re more used to this altitude!\u201D\
  \ \n\nIt took me an hour. As I climbed the last steps with my hair stuck to my face,\
  \ cheeks red, Michael looked down at from the top cool as a cucumber, arms crossed.\
  \ He had been waiting for 15 minutes. I joined him and we walked together the mirador\
  \ looking over the city, the sun caressing the colorful houses that climbed up the\
  \ side of the mountain, and the red rooftops of the city looking all the more vibrant\
  \ against the green of its parks. Maybe we hadn't seen Vinicunca on its best day\
  \ in Peru, but Michael seemed to have a Rainbow Mountain of his own at home.\n\n\
  We stood there, taking in the view until our stomachs rumbled. Michael turned and\
  \ grinned at me: \"Race you down?\""
