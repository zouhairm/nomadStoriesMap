Text: "When I set out to explore Europe, I didn\u2019t anticipate splitting a pepperoni\
  \ pizza with a Pakistani refugee in a French grocery store. But such things happen.\
  \ I shouldn\u2019t call him a refugee \u2013 he\u2019s Ahmed. I also shouldn\u2019\
  t call it \u2018splitting\u2019\u2013 that\u2019s a liberal interpretation of the\
  \ cheese dangling from Ahmed\u2019s beard and the majority of our pizza in his belly.\
  \ \n\nAhmed is trying tonight. 'Try' is part of our joint language here in the burnt\
  \ down remains of the northern France refugee camps, where I am a volunteer. It\
  \ means smuggle. It means tomorrow morning, Ahmed could be in the UK. Or a French\
  \ detention center. \n\n\u201CIs special try,\u201D Ahmed gesticulates between bites.\
  \ \u201CAll my money.\u201D\n\nTonight, a British couple will hide Ahmed beneath\
  \ the floor of their van. \u201CExtra for UK child,\u201D Ahmed reminds me with\
  \ a toothy grin. The couple\u2019s child will sit atop Ahmed\u2019s hidey hole,\
  \ and smile sweetly to border security. Ahmed will arrive in the UK in style \u2013\
  \ no chance of refrigerated lorries or sardine-packed fellow migrants for him. \n\
  \nHe licks his fingers, and insists on paying the bill. \u201CGoing away party!\u201D\
  \ he informs me. \n\nI\u2019ve been in Dunkirk, France for a few months, now. I\
  \ live in a caravan park with the other (mostly English) volunteers \u2013 there\u2019\
  s no hot water and none of us are proficient enough in French to argue with the\
  \ landlord. That, or he conveniently misunderstands. \n\nSome mornings, before we\
  \ set out in the rusted Honda to pass out donations, I run along the packed sand\
  \ beach. Across the water, there\u2019s England. I look at the slate channel meeting\
  \ the yellow sky and think of the country I called home for the last four years.\
  \ Averting my eyes, I continue running. Even sand feels like mud here. \n\nWith\
  \ my American passport, it was just a bit of bureaucracy before Britain granted\
  \ my student visa. Now that I\u2019ve graduated, they\u2019ve politely kicked me\
  \ out and I\u2019m on the classic Euro trip. I long to return to England, and the\
  \ idyll of a freshly adult identity, not my American Midwest homeland. In a few\
  \ months, though, I\u2019ll be back in my home state that voted for a border-hungry\
  \ president by 10,000 votes. But my resentment fizzles when I remember Ahmed and\
  \ the other refugees. We don\u2019t talk about their homes, but I know in Pakistan,\
  \ Ahmed\u2019s homosexuality is a crime punishable by death. \n\nThe movie Dunkirk\
  \ came out this summer. People loved it. Scrolling through social media, I\u2019\
  m often met with Harry Styles\u2019 pasty face. 'Dunkirk: When 400,000 men couldn\u2019\
  t get home,' the movie poster reads. In present day Dunkirk, lines of brown-skinned\
  \ men wait for the meal that is offered to them once each day.  Cases of trench\
  \ foot crop up among them \u2013 the first in the area since World War II. The French\
  \ police swagger about with their guns. Once, they stopped us from giving a blind\
  \ unaccompanied minor a blanket for the night. \u201C\xC7a les encourage\u201D they\
  \ said. It just encourages them. I know the rule: No fixed abodes. No homes in that\
  \ desolate forest. \n\nThe morning after Ahmed\u2019s Going Away Party, I arrive\
  \ in the camp, as usual. I and the other volunteers clamber out of our not-so-trusty\
  \ Honda, just as a crowd begins to form. I open the trunk to reach for our damp\
  \ box of socks, a highly requested item and the first line of defense against trench\
  \ foot. As I resurface, there\u2019s \u2013\n\n\u201CAhmed!\u201D I gasp. It\u2019\
  s a reflex. What else do you say to a man who traveled 5,861 km from a home that\
  \ wants him dead, is 124 km from his destination, and just spent all his money on\
  \ a failed try? \u201CI didn\u2019t expect to see you,\u201D I fumble. \n\nAhmed\
  \ shrugs. I swear there is still cheese in his beard. \u201CPolice,\u201D he gestures\
  \ broadly. Then: \u201CNo chance.\u201D As if those two words encompass all there\
  \ is to say. But his eyes \u2013 here, I find hope. I pass him a pair of socks.\
  \ He\u2019ll need them."
