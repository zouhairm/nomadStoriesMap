Text: "\u201CToo fast too fast, Must slow down,\u201D the guy next to me mumbled in\
  \ broken English, waving his hands in the air. We nervously watched on as Jesse\
  \ wobbled and teetered on both sides of the Balinese back road, like a toddler taking\
  \ his first few steps but atop a spluttering and rusty old moped.\n\nHe eventually\
  \ made it over to us unharmed and beaming. \n\u201CWe\u2019ll take it!\u201D he\
  \ told the guy as he unbuckled his helmet and lifted it from his head. Thanks to\
  \ Ubud\u2019s 85% humidity, he was red-faced, dripping with sweat and his hair had\
  \ been glued unfavourably to his forehead. A far stretch from Ubud\u2019s claim\
  \ to fame, Eat, Pray, Love, in which the new love interest gracefully pulls off\
  \ his helmet revealing silky though slightly overgrown hair to flow in the wind\
  \ while gleaming from calculated lighting rather than sweat.\n\nOur new Balinese\
  \ friend and I faltered. While I questioned my possibly misled expectations of an\
  \ intimate journey of self-discovery, dotted with spiritual awakenings, emerald\
  \ landscapes and encounters with wise Dali Llama type figures, he seemed torn between\
  \ making some quick cash and possibly becoming a murder accomplice. He settled on\
  \ a quick warning before waving us off.\n\u201CMust slow down! Careful, please\u201D\
  \ \n\nBefore I had a chance to object, Jesse had pulled his helmet back on and tossed\
  \ the second helmet toward me. \n\u201CJump on\u201D he yelled over the motor and\
  \ nodded behind him at the slither of the remaining seat space.\n\nAs I straddled\
  \ the bike behind him, Jesse began waddling the bike towards the chaos that is Ubud's\
  \ main road. Minutes later we arrived at our first intersection pumped with adrenaline\
  \ but otherwise intact. A constant stream of topless children on motorbikes and\
  \ rusty pickup trucks sped past us. Even a monkey clinging to the back of a middle-aged\
  \ man drifted past, oblivious to the chaos and turmoil surrounding him. \n\nThere\
  \ were no lights, no lollipop man, no pedestrian crossing and no foreseeable gap\
  \ in traffic. At least not for us. While we panicked, a young Balinese family -\
  \ two young children sandwiched between a man and woman, crept up beside us on a\
  \ scooter similar to ours. They peered curiously over to see who was holding up\
  \ the traffic before roaring head first into the frenzy of people and wheels. Following\
  \ their lead, Jesse pulled back on the throttle and blindly entrusted our lives\
  \ to fate. After all, we were in the Island of the Gods. \n\nBesides a few quick\
  \ beeps and amused looks, we were still alive and now a small part of the ten-mile\
  \ long traffic jam. Slowly and erratically we rolled past colourful stalls run by\
  \ withered and tanned locals, trenches of plastic bottles that lined the road and\
  \ then a bejewelled and somewhat terrifying creature, (Barong, as we were told later)\
  \ writhing in time to the drums and symbols played by the children circling him.\
  \ Looking closely, I noticed three pairs of small bare feet peeking through the\
  \ fabric. \n\nTen minutes later the festivities and bright colours of the city morphed\
  \ into Temples adorned with yellow silk and flowers, rice paddies guarded by small\
  \ men in straw hats and hundreds of flea-infested dogs. Though the scenery changed,\
  \ the feeling of bliss and contentment, did not. \n\nAmidst the poverty, rubbish\
  \ and chaos that engulfed this small country, laughter trickled down every alleyway,\
  \ smiles flooded every tanned and weathered face we passed and a sense of joy lingered\
  \ in the air despite the constant traffic. People were happy here, barefoot and\
  \ bankrupt. In love with their island lives, they were blessed by not only the Gods,\
  \ but their own ability to find peace within chaos and love despite poverty. \n\n\
  We pulled in to our $20 per night hotel and ripped off our helmets. Perhaps Bali\
  \ had a thing or two to teach me after all. We began walking towards our room and\
  \ the receptionist ran over to greet us with pineapple juice, beaming as we drained\
  \ the cups. \n\u201CYou like?\u201D He asked, hungry for our praise. \n\u201CWe\
  \ love!\u201D I told him, watching his smile grow bigger."
