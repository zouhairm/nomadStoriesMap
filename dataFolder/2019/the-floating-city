Text: "There\u2019s something particularly telling about the graffiti in Cork. I noticed\
  \ it upon arrival, displayed on stone walls and fences, on buildings and various\
  \ facets of the cityscape. The art provides color, combating gray walls and a pallid\
  \ sky.\nThere\u2019s one work in particular that marks a small electrical box in\
  \ the midst of the city. Etched in black and white against red, reads the following:\n\
  \ \nIreland is like a bottle, it would sink without a Cork.\n \nWould Ireland sink,\
  \ deep into the Atlantic, without its southern coast?\nI\u2019m not so sure.\nWhat\
  \ I am sure of is its effect on me: its energy picking me up when I was down, teaching\
  \ me how to wade through the streets on my own. It was the city that kept me afloat,\
  \ and as always in Ireland, it is a city marked by its proximity to water.\nI knew\
  \ close to nothing about Cork before venturing there. I was like a child on a pier,\
  \ antsy and seeking adventure. Purchasing my plane ticket was my means of taking\
  \ a leap into a life that had yet to see beyond the boundaries of New England country\
  \ roads and picket fences. I took a deep breath, pumped my legs, and ran into it.\
  \ Splash.\nWould I recommend this in the future? No. In fact, I soon learned that\
  \ the smartest travelers are researchers, prepared and familiar with the intricacies\
  \ of the land they venture to. At the time however, I was an amateur itching to\
  \ explore beyond the confines of what I\u2019d always known. On one hand I was unprepared\
  \ for a total change of scenery; yet on the other, my ignorance forced me to live\
  \ in the moment.\nIn Irish, the word Cork is actually Corcaigh, or marshland. The\
  \ city itself is just that: a marsh, stretching its way in between channels that\
  \ crisscross and breach from the ancient River Lee. The depths of the river flow\
  \ through the land, sustained by a constant inundation of rain from above. I found\
  \ myself encamped on its banks in the spring of 2017, lodged in a small apartment\
  \ with five others from the States. We meandered through the streets as six distinct\
  \ personalities to add to the already colorful collection of souls that dwelled\
  \ there.\nThe Irish populace proved endearing and welcoming, with a kind of dry\
  \ humor that even their surroundings can\u2019t quench.\n\u201CWhat\u2019re ya doin\u2019\
  \ in Cork?\u201D Many asked baffled when I said I chose here, of all places I could\
  \ have gone, to stay long term. \u201CWhy not another city in Europe? Why not Dublin?\u201D\
  \nI\u2019d shrug, unsure of how to answer.\nI attended classes in the local university,\
  \ roamed the quaint stores of brick and mortar, and enjoyed pints that flowed freely\
  \ by night. I journeyed around not looking for anything in particular, but finding\
  \ more than I could have ever wanted in a city.\nIn doing so, I gained an answer\
  \ to the ever-present question: why Cork?\nIt was a place, not only to travel to,\
  \ but to make one\u2019s home. I wanted to immerse myself, seeing life through the\
  \ lens of more than a tourist, and Cork allowed me to do just that.\nNow, I miss\
  \ the rain, the river, the marshland, and still think of it often while walking\
  \ through dry New England air, chilling my bones and sinking into my skin. I close\
  \ my eyes and picture myself there, alongside that river once more. In fact, once\
  \ in a while I miss Cork in a way I can hardly muster words to describe. It is a\
  \ kind of pain that comes only from a remembrance of past happiness, so immense\
  \ it must be longing.\nCork, and Ireland itself, has the power to make you feel\
  \ like you belong. I may not have explored its every crevice and cliff, I may not\
  \ live there again, I may not be there now. Regardless, I will always keep it a\
  \ home in my soul, nestled alongside the yearning, burning, perpetual desire to\
  \ travel\u2014 to go\u2014 to take a leap and submerge into the unknown\u2026\n\
  all because a floating city taught me how to do so."
