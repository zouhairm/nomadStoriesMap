Text: "Cold January nights, dim lights and the smell of tiny green hotel shampoo bottles.\
  \ A half-full bottle of champagne in the corner, palm trees swaying behind the sliding\
  \ doors. Bright white sheets and my reflection in the mirror. I was feeling uncertain\
  \ but confident. I didn't feel nervous, I didn't feel alone, I didn't feel bored,\
  \ I didn't feel any of the emotions that would be absolutely appropriate to feel\
  \ for someone in my situation. But I was never famous for having the right feelings.\
  \ Some people take it as a lack of feelings... Most people when faced with the unfamiliar\
  \ and/or unexpected prefer to give it a negative meaning rather than figure out\
  \ the real one. It doesn't bother me that much, though.\n\nBeach walks on the first\
  \ day of the year, cold ocean water on my ankles, everything feels new and I'm enjoying\
  \ every inch of it. Street lights on Manhattan Beach pier, palm trees on Venice\
  \ Boulevard, planes descending over Westchester, lush trees outside my bungalow.\
  \ Bus rides to Santa Monica, morning walks to work, sudden plans and quick changes.\n\
  Smiling at strangers, engaging in conversations, feeling open and happy. \n\nOn\
  \ the overnight bus form LA to SF, top deck, middle seat, dimmed lights, swaying\
  \ empty plastic bags hanging from the aisle seats making it look like I'm on some\
  \ thriller movie set. But it feels safe and cozy. A friendly bus driver chatting\
  \ about the rules and precautions, he mentioned there's going be a pit stop at 2am,\
  \ \"Wendy's and a gas station, to stretch your legs or have a smoke or whatever\
  \ you feel like\". He almost made me feel like he cared. Hearing someone casually\
  \ talk about Wendy's and shit made me feel like I was home, so familiar, for some\
  \ reason. Even though deep down it's all fake, the whole American dream is just\
  \ a big illusion, but it's not like it doesn't exist - it does... Just because it's\
  \ fake doesn't mean it can't make you feel real (feelings). It's all just a big\
  \ journey to nowhere and everywhere at the same time. I think I'm finally getting\
  \ the hang of not caring about where I'm headed and just fully succumbing into the\
  \ moment. It's so much easier when you can actually enjoy each moment without forcing\
  \ yourself to. But it's not a \"wherever the road takes me\" attitude. It's wherever\
  \ my future self takes me. And I better work on the present me to make sure it'll\
  \ be a good place and not something dark and unpleasant.\nWhen I think about where\
  \ I used to be mentally and territorially it feels like a bad dream... when I think\
  \ about St Pete the first things that come to my mind are: walking to uni in the\
  \ cold winter morning, rushing into that big old dark building with arched ceilings\
  \ and rusty walls; or walking through narrow barely lit streets being slightly scared\
  \ for my life; or walking along the canals and feeling like your bones are shivering\
  \ with each gust of the icy wind; the sunrise at 5am and feeling a bit disoriented\
  \ but inspired in the center of a big deserted street downtown; spending the nights\
  \ with my friends, the nights were so casual and familiar and mostly of the same\
  \ scenario, yet so anticipated and special each time; looking up at the moon peeking\
  \ in between the buildings of my best friend's old apartment... So many warm and\
  \ happy memories when I start to pick my mind apart but when it's all there, piled\
  \ up, it just forms a bleak and gooey mass, and I prefer not to think about it so\
  \ I won't get sucked into that portal of doom. It sounds too dramatic but that's\
  \ just how I feel. I like to tell myself that it's okay to feel whatever way I do\
  \ because feelings are irrational and I have no accountability for them whatsoever,\
  \ I can't control them. The best way is to let go. \n\nIt's so unfamiliar to feel\
  \ so good, not deep down, not in theory, not almost, not for a moment, not deliberately\
  \ - just simply & unequivocally, right here and out in the open."
