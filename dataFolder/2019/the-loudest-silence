Text: "It was the loudest silence I had ever heard. I had expected beaches, loud music\
  \ and swarms of tourists. Instead, I was swept up in an unexpected calm. Sweat dripped\
  \ down my forehead, as I gazed around me, taking it all in. \n\nWe had made it to\
  \ the top of the mountain. It was midday, and the blazing Spanish sun illuminated\
  \ the sandstone chapel at the top of the hill. Several goats roamed the courtyard,\
  \ one climbing elegantly along the stone walls that fenced the area. Behind the\
  \ chapel, was the monastery. It stretched across the hilltop, overlooking the rolling\
  \ hills and the blue of the mediterranean sea. Not a single sound could be heard,\
  \ but that of the goats, the muffled buzzing, and occasional snapping of locusts,\
  \ nestled in the surrounding olive trees. There was a warm breeze, yet everything\
  \ felt still.\n\nIt had been a long day. I had planned a European trip for my family,\
  \ and had done an impressive job. That was until the night before, when I hadn\u2019\
  t reserved a ferry from Barcelona to Mallorca. I had misunderstood that I could\
  \ purchase ferry tickets the day of departure. In hindsight, I was delusional to\
  \ have even considered this. It was August, afterall.\n\nBy some stroke of luck,\
  \ we arrived to Palma, Mallorca by overnight crossing. After an early bus ride,\
  \ we found the small town of Pollenca, nestled at the foot of the towering giant,\
  \ home to our accommodations at the Santuari de Maria del Puig. I felt anxious at\
  \ the thought, wondering if I had actually made a reservation.\n\nI had called a\
  \ number I\u2019d seen on a blog. After what I deemed to be a successful Spanish/English\
  \ exchange, I was convinced I had used my less-than-conversational Spanish to secure\
  \ a stay at a former monastery. I was beginning to feel unsure.\n\nExhausted and\
  \ hungry, we stumbled into the town, greeted by the sights and scents of an elaborate\
  \ day market. Varieties of olives glistened in the already hot sun. We chose instead,\
  \ to purchase an entire watermelon.\n\nAfter a cold drink, we decided it was time\
  \ to make the trek to our accommodations. It had quickly become evident that the\
  \ only way to reach the monastery was by foot. The smell of sun from the sweet fruit\
  \ of a fig tree, marked what would become our daily forty minute hike. \n\nThe silence\
  \ broke. The crunch of footsteps signaled my brother\u2019s approach. He lay the\
  \ watermelon beside me, and sat down, followed by my mother and sister. No one said\
  \ a word; partially due to exhaustion, but mostly because the mountain top was deserted.\
  \ It felt wrong to speak. \n\nI entered the monastery, and let out a sigh of relief.\
  \ A woman verified my name on a handwritten calendar. At least we would have somewhere\
  \ to sleep for the next few nights. \n\nThe accommodations were simple; two beds,\
  \ and a small table. It felt as if the monastery had been abandoned more recently\
  \ than 1575, when the nuns were ordered to leave. We had travelled through time.\n\
  \nWe ordered dinner for the evening, traditional Mallorcan lentil soup, and four\
  \ americanos, which we brought to the courtyard. The aroma mixed with that of the\
  \ goats, the dry grass, and the ocean breeze blowing through the leaves of a huge\
  \ siliqua tree. In the distance, the sky was darkening, hints of a summer storm\
  \ creeping in on the horizon.\n\nThe coffee was no match for our exhaustion. We\
  \ were awoken a few hours later by the sound of sheets of water hitting the orange\
  \ terracotta shingles of the roof. A huge gust of wind had thrown open the wooden\
  \ shutters. The sky was a purple-black, the rain relentless. I got out of bed, and\
  \ sat in the window, watching rivers of rain cascade off the shingles of the monastery\
  \ roof. For a moment, it made me want to believe in God.\n\nEvery now and then,\
  \ when my mind drifts to Mallorca, as it often does, I do not think of the breathtaking\
  \ beaches. I think of that August in Spain, when my soul was reset on a hilltop,\
  \ in the midst of a summer storm."
