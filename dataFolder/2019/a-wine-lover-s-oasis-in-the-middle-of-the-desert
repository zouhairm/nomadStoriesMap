Text: "\"They call it 'The Liar\u2019, because it\u2019s not what it seems\u201D,\
  \ explains the Argentinian winemaker as he pours a splash of Torront\xE9s into my\
  \ glass.  \n\nHe watches as I swirl the bright gold liquid around, letting the sweet\
  \ aroma fill my nostrils. With my first sip, I know I've been tricked. This wine\
  \ is much dryer than it smells and has an unexpected depth of flavour. The winemaker\
  \ smiles. \"The Liar\", he repeats, satisfied my surprise has validated the name.\
  \  \n\nI am in wine heaven... otherwise known as Cafayate. Perched at a baffling\
  \ elevation of almost 1,700m above sea level, and in the middle of the desert, this\
  \ dusty little town is the unlikely producer of world-class wine. In particular,\
  \ Cafayate is renowned for its enigmatic Torront\xE9s grape; a white wine unique\
  \ to Argentina but often overshadowed by the country\u2019s flagship varietal, Malbec.\
  \   \n\nWhile this region may not have the tourism draw-cards of bright city lights\
  \ or activity, it holds the impressive moniker of \u2018highest wine growing region\
  \ on earth\u2019. As a dedicated wine enthusiast, this was enough to pique my interest\
  \ and plan a visit.  \n\nIsolated in Argentina\u2019s barren north west, Cafayate\
  \ isn\u2019t the easiest destination to get to. More than 1,400 kilometres from\
  \ the capital, Buenos Aires, and a 200km drive from the province capital, Salta,\
  \ the journey involves many hours of overland travel.  \n\nUpon arriving, the town\
  \ is no more than a quaint cluster of colonial-style buildings, huddled around a\
  \ central square. These ageing structures have been sun-bleached into sandy hues,\
  \ the effect of 330 blistering days of sunshine per year. However, it\u2019s the\
  \ smattering of bodegas (the Spanish term for wine cellar) that have drawn me here.\
  \ Dotted around the outskirts of town, rows and rows of thirsty-looking vines reach\
  \ out across bone-dry soil. Implausibly, they are flourishing in the middle of this\
  \ arid landscape, as they have for more than 125 years.   \n\nThese grape vines\
  \ have direct sun exposure almost every day of the year; their roots forced to stretch\
  \ down many metres into the earth in search of moisture. With oppressive summer\
  \ highs of 40-degrees Celsius, this region produces ripe grapes with high acid and\
  \ sugar content. At night, the temperature plummets into single digits, which preserves\
  \ the balance of natural acid. This extreme fluctuation is known as \u2018thermal\
  \ amplitude\u2019 and it\u2019s a key ingredient in the region's characteristically\
  \ intense colour, aroma and flavour.  \n\nCafayate\u2019s charming bodegas are mostly\
  \ family owned and conveniently situated only a couple of hundred metres apart.\
  \ I quickly learn the best way to visit them is to hire a bicycle and pedal from\
  \ one bodega to the next. The flat terrain makes the journey an easy one, but the\
  \ dirt roads are incredibly stony (fortunately, every bike rental comes with a tyre\
  \ puncture kit). At each cellar door I\u2019m greeted by descendants of the vineyard's\
  \ founders, whom enthusiastically share their wine knowledge and colourful family\
  \ history. Between the hours of 1pm and 3pm, most of the bodegas close for a customary\
  \ siesta. I find this break in the day slightly prohibitive to my program of wine-sampling,\
  \ however, I use this time to visit Museo de la Vid y el Vino (Museum of the Vine\
  \ and the Wine) to learn how this little-known region is rivalling the best wine\
  \ producers in the world. \n\nEven after the sun has set on the day, my wine adventure\
  \ is far from over. In response to the influx of tourism, a few swanky wine bars\
  \ have opened their doors and offer a curated tasting experience of the region in\
  \ one convenient place. Visitors have the opportunity sample exclusive small harvest\
  \ wines and local cellar door releases. These are not bottled for exportation, and\
  \ therefore, must be enjoyed there and then. Unable to decide between a tasting\
  \ flight of white or red wines, I order both and take my time to savour as many\
  \ of Cafayate\u2019s unique varietals as I can.  \n\nThis out-of-the-way destination\
  \ truly is a wine lover's oasis in the middle of the desert. It's remote, it\u2019\
  s hot, but it\u2019s well worth taking a detour and sampling everything this little\
  \ town has to offer; you never know, the unexpected flavour may surprise you."
