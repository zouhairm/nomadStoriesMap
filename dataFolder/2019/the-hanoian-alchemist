Text: "With the first taste I felt a warmth overcome my body. My taste-buds quivered\
  \ with anticipation as the sticky-sweet substance sent my senses into a frenzy\n\
  \nMy mother\u2019s chocolate ersatz had always been a hit with the family. Whether\
  \ it was for a birthday, a broken arm or just a dull, rainy day, any excuse called\
  \ for its creation. Nothing felt more comforting than its luscious smell wafting\
  \ through the house and the warm glare of the oven against my cheek as my sister\
  \ and I peeked inside impatiently. No recipe in sight, this was an undisclosed family\
  \ formula. Born out of a time of scarcity during Poland\u2019s Communist rule, my\
  \ mother had concocted this culinary craft from the very few items she could acquire\
  \ with her ration papers. I held my mother\u2019s recipe in the highest regard and\
  \ vowed to guard her secret with my life.\n\nThe light buzz of motorcycle engines\
  \ rose in the distance and the fresh smell of peach blossom lingered in the air.\
  \ The sound of clanging dishes on street corners echoed as the stillness of the\
  \ night descended into a familiar chaos. Dawn was breaking over Hanoi. \n\nAs I\
  \ roamed the vibrant streets of the Old Quarter in search of my morning coffee,\
  \ meandering through the omnipresent tangle of snarling traffic, I wondered whether\
  \ I would ever master the art of crossing the street in this city. Open doors revealed\
  \ dim, marble-floored rooms, offering a glimpse into the intimate lives of Hanoian\
  \ locals. The tired smile of a grandmother, her face withered by the ravages of\
  \ time and war. A child, gently swinging in a rope hammock, avoiding the harsh glare\
  \ of the sun. A tailless cat weaving its way through food stands, scouring the street\
  \ for scraps. I watched as two men with goatees and bamboo hats perched on a shaded\
  \ street corner, heavily engrossed in a game of chess. The sudden blare of a horn\
  \ snapped me back into reality, as a motorcycle carrying a family of four and an\
  \ orange tree hurtled past me. Nope. I would never learn.\n\nThe magic of Hanoi\
  \ had stunned me from the moment I arrived. Nestled on the banks of the Red River,\
  \ this vibrant, dynamic city had enough charm to inspire even the most jaded traveller.\
  \ Its unique identity - indomitably Vietnamese, yet marked by French and Chinese\
  \ influences - was a testament to the unwavering resilience of its inhabitants in\
  \ the face of foreign occupation. \n\nAs I finally reached the lake at the end of\
  \ the main street, I examined a row of houses to my left in an attempt to find the\
  \ one which matched the description I was given by my host-father. One house appeared\
  \ older and more weathered than the others. I walked towards it and gave the musty\
  \ green door a light push, revealing a narrow stone staircase. I climbed three floors\
  \ as instructed and turned right into a large room flooded with light. Instantly,\
  \ an overwhelmingly rich smell hit me. I stepped into the room and ordered my first\
  \ Hanoian egg coffee. \n\nBorn out of a time of struggle in 1940s Vietnam, Hanoian\
  \ egg coffee, or C\xE0 ph\xEA tr\xFAng, had become a local sensation in the capital\
  \ and beyond. A lack of fresh milk had inspired a family to innovate by replacing\
  \ it with whisked egg yolk, and while outsiders were allowed to taste the delectable\
  \ concoction and revel at its brilliance, the recipe remains a mystery. An undisclosed\
  \ family formula.\n\nWith the first taste I felt a warmth overcome my body. My taste-buds\
  \ quivered with anticipation as the sticky-sweet substance sent my senses into a\
  \ frenzy. I smiled. This coffee could do with some chocolate ersatz."
