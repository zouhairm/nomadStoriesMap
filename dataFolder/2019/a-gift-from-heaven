Text: "\u201CKeep the doors shut at all times,\u201D Mathew had instructed whilst\
  \ leaving the house for his 11 AM meeting. \u201CThe terrain is rampant with snakes,\
  \ poisonous ones.  And I refuse to live in this house once it has been discovered\
  \ by them.\u201D He finished on his way out.\n\nMathew was never one to be afraid\
  \ of snakes in my recollection, as poor as it may be. I was a student of his from\
  \ many years ago and this peculiar demand of his wasn\u2019t something I was going\
  \ to question.\n\nI shut up the doors as instructed and went about discovering his\
  \ house. Mathew was a Professor of Film Studies at the Indian Institute of Management\
  \ in Kozhikode, Kerala, India. He had been quite a revolutionary in his day and\
  \ had half the capitalist state governments of the country glad to have seen the\
  \ back of him now that he was back in his (communist) home state. His house was\
  \ an ode to his past, covered inch to inch with rare film posters from the glory\
  \ days of Indian film. His students at the notoriously capitalist institution he\
  \ was now part of had helped him acquire some of the more expensive and rare ones,\
  \ he had informed me. \u201CWell, someone has got to pay for the revolution. Might\
  \ as well be these guys.\u201D I thought aloud as I stared at the original print\
  \ of the modern (1957) classic \u2018Mother India\u2019- a landmark film if ever\
  \ there was any.\n\nAs I made my way into his famed library, I was convinced he\
  \ was worried more about poster thieves than about snakes. I sank into a chair and\
  \ pulled out a book from the nearest shelf. It had that new book smell that can\
  \ motivate even the most stubborn non-readers into flipping a few pages and that\u2019\
  s exactly what I did before the contours of the chair took over and I drifted into\
  \ a dreamless, sweaty slumber.\n\n\u201CWake up, Rahul! You are going to be late.\u201D\
  \ Mathew\u2019s delicious baritone came screaming into the library as I rubbed my\
  \ eyes and looked for a watch. I had a train to take to Cochin that same evening\
  \ and a flight onward from there to Bangalore at midnight. It was a tight itinerary\
  \ and Mathew had warned me about delays, but stubborn as I was about spending every\
  \ possible minute with him, I had booked the last possible train out of Kozhikode.\
  \ \n\n\u20184.30\u2019 read the digital watch in the library and I knew there would\
  \ be no time for pictures as I had to make the train at 5.30 PM. His house was a\
  \ good 45 minute auto (tuk tuk) ride from the train station and without one around,\
  \ I started to check for refunds on my travel app. I could have bought Mathew a\
  \ new classic movie poster with the money I was about to lose.\n\nMathew sensed\
  \ my resignation and made a phone call. He then called me out on the veranda for\
  \ a smoke. \u201CWe will get you on that train, Rahul, but you are going to have\
  \ to be nice enough to get there.\u201D \n\u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D\n\u201C\
  In Kerala, locals will do crazy things for the people they like.\u201D That\u2019\
  s all he had said when we were interrupted by a door bell. \u201CThat must be Santhosh.\
  \ You better get packed\u201D. It was 4.45.\n\nI was still packing my rucksack when\
  \ I encountered Santhosh and Mathew folding a beautifully printed cotton bed sheet\
  \ in the living room. \u201CThis is Santhosh, he is the only guy who can get you\
  \ on that train,\u201D said Mathew. \u201DMy sister has sent him a new bed spread\
  \ for his daughter\u2019s wedding. Come take a look?\u201D\n\n \u201CCan I give\
  \ him something?\u201D I asked before bringing out a brand new white cotton shirt\
  \ from my rucksack. I had bought it as a gift for Mathew the day before but in the\
  \ wrong size. \n\n\u201CIs it a size 40?\u201D \n\n\u201CYes!\u201D Santhosh was\
  \ thrilled as he took the shirt, \u201CThanks. Why don\u2019t you come back in Thulam\
  \ (September) for the wedding?\u201D\n\n\u201CIf I can make it back today, I will.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CI will make sure that you do.\u201D And he did."
