Text: "When we are young we travel to be away from our parents, away from our cities,\
  \ away from our traditions and our food, there is no more beauty in life than the\
  \ innocence of a child trying to find all the things he is missing in life somewhere\
  \ else, this is the story of my life, Mexican young boy traveling abroad, looking\
  \ for all the answers in life, wondering why things are as it should be, questioning\
  \ about life and personal purpose.\n\nThere is no desk procedure to travel abroad,\
  \ we have many pictures of people traveling all the time, what they didn't tell\
  \ you is that travel makes you stronger, travel let you see life as it is, and there\
  \ is nothing more beautiful than to be face to face with yourself, appreciate all\
  \ that you have, serve each other around no matter the situation.\n\nTravel to Spain\
  \ for one year, make me recognize that life is just a second and that I'm truly\
  \ grateful for being here in this amazing journey, I didn't expect to find myself\
  \ in that trip, to know me who I am and take care only of myself, if I found the\
  \ beauty inside me now I can go ahead and find someone who will love me a little\
  \ bit more than what I do right now.\n\nWhile looking for everything I had missing\
  \ in my life out there, I understood that I had it in my life all the time but I\
  \ wasn't looking clear, the clearness was defined by the courage of leaving everything\
  \ behind, therefore the love of my life and the life I have chosen was just waiting\
  \ for me in Mexico, come back to the place you left where you have everything you\
  \ need to be happy has been truly the greatest experiences in life.\n\nI Really\
  \ want to change people lives while encouraging to go out there, to find everything\
  \ and don't find anything, to return home and value life as it is because we are\
  \ one world, we are all brothers and sisters and this traveling should be unifying\
  \ all of us togheter. \n\nSincerely\nXavi"
