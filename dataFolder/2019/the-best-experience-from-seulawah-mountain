Text: "I once submitted a request to my parents about this semester's vacation. but,\
  \ I'm confused about where I will go for this vacation. my parents advised me to\
  \ take a trip to Seulawah mountain. I just agreed to what my parents suggested.\
  \ because I always think that parents always know what's best for their children.\n\
  \nmy family and I departed from Darussalam, my most beautiful village. \nand we\
  \ went using the previous Kijang car, we went through the main road or public road.\
  \ \nbefore the trip, my mother told me to take medicine so as not to nausea on the\
  \ way. The journey from my house to Gunung Seulawah was quite a lot of time and\
  \ the distance was quite far. But, because I went with my family, I went with the\
  \ car so that the distance no received a problem. And the compilation arrived at\
  \ the mountain below the mountain condition was still foggy and I was wearing a\
  \ jacket because the mountain below would repair it would feel very cold.\nwhen,\
  \ my family and I arrived at my destination I was very happy because I could play\
  \ around it. starting from playing with monkeys to disturbing pigs. and how lucky\
  \ I was that day because on that day the elephant came down from the mountain. my\
  \ family and I immediately approached the village to take a photo together. I was\
  \ rather idly I tried to feed the elephant by giving carrots to the elephant. And\
  \ what happened ?. the elephant hugged me with its trunk. although it feels a bit\
  \ horrible but, quite exciting because it can meet directly with elephants that\
  \ we think we will be trampled by because the elephant's body is very large. my\
  \ mother panicked because the elephant hugged me. my mother's concern was also caused\
  \ by me. because, before I feed the elephant. my mother told me not to approach\
  \ the elephant. because, something unwanted can happen at any time. \nmy day's sightseeing\
  \ ended with buying souvenirs from the saree market. both crackers, fresh vegetables,\
  \ and much more. and before I set foot in my village in Darussalam. I could see\
  \ a very beautiful view. namely watching the sun set in the afternoon from the top\
  \ of Mount Seulawah while eating crackers that I bought at the Saree market. I saw\
  \ the sun sink into the vast expanse of the ocean. so beautiful the beauty of this\
  \ world."
