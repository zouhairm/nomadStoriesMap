Text: "Pakistan is a country which has unfortunately remained deprived of good governance\
  \ from the time when the subcontinent was torn into two pieces. This deprivation\
  \ has got many areas endure on national as well as on domestic level. Cultural heritage\
  \ is one of those calamitous part of our country which has hardly been taken care\
  \ of. The past of our side of subcontinent is packed with historic events, wonderful\
  \ places and ancient civilizations including the oldest considered Indus Valley\
  \ Civilization, a part of rich culture of Sindh. The land of Sindh has many histories\
  \ buried in her chest. Some of which are discovered, some has remained undiscovered.\
  \ As mentioned earlier, some part of our cultural heritage has been facing hard\
  \ time due to the lack of interest by government authorities. There are many parts\
  \ which are regrettably left unowned. The Qalamati Graveyard near Malir District\
  \ in one of them.\n\nDuring my stay in District Malir of Karachi in September last\
  \ year, thanks to my dear friend Halar Khan, I got a chance to visit this wondrous\
  \ graveyard. It seemed enormously attractive even from miles away, catching eyes\
  \ of everyone passing by. Situated outside Memon goth, this graveyard barely gets\
  \ any visitor in months.\n\nArcheologists says that this 60 Acres widespread graveyard\
  \ is nearly 700 years old. This burial site remained under the ownership of Balouch\
  \ Qalmati Tribe for a long time till 18th century who then started migrating to\
  \ different part of United India due to the acceleratory influence of British into\
  \ the region and slanderous tribal disputes. There are many important personalities\
  \ of Qalmati Balouch Tribe buried here including their chief Malik Toota Khan. Archeology\
  \ experts also says that Qalmatis from different parts of region including Pasni,\
  \ Gawadar, Lasbella, and Thatta used to reside here as well. They reckoned this\
  \ area as a sacred place to live at and to be buried as well after death, which\
  \ is said to be the reason behind this residential part of land turning into a mighty\
  \ graveyard. Archeologists claim that there are utmost 600 bigger graves measured\
  \ about 15 ft in height and many smaller graves present in the graveyard. \n\n\n\
  \nThe Qalmati Balouch Graveyard is an amazing art of sculpture. The graves reflect\
  \ some brilliant handcrafting work which gives an idea how the carving art was used\
  \ to beautify materials. Archeologists says that it used to cost 10,000 Rupees for\
  \ the construction and handcrafting work on one grave in 17th century. \n\n\nHowever,\
  \ It was sad to see that the graveyard was left on its own. Many graves were broken\
  \ in half and no board nor fence was settled around it. No guide was found to provide\
  \ information about the place. The encroachments around the graveyard are demolishing\
  \ the beauty of it. Archeologists has showed concerns that many graves are being\
  \ destructed in the search of treasure left my Qalmatis. The Government seems nowhere\
  \ in this situation and it hasn't taken any efforts to save such heritage of our\
  \ Motherland. Such historical places and heritage are the important part of our\
  \ history as well as part of our identification. If we loose them, we'll loose our\
  \ identity!"
