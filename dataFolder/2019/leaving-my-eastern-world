Text: "Here I am, walking through the most ancient civilization of the world. A world\
  \ that I barely know and a world that is asking me to discover it so much more.\n\
  If you ask me, I wouldn\u2019t say that I leaved my country, M\xE9xico, I probably\
  \ would say that I left my globe, my eastern globe. \nToday I\u2019m more conscious\
  \ about the existence of a completely new way of living of some people and I\u2019\
  m stunned. My education, experiences and my simple way of life had leaved me a really\
  \ occidental way of living and that didn\u2019t permit me to think about different\
  \ ways of experimenting the complex nature of things. \nNow, I\u2019m here\u2026\
  \ watching the world without occidental lenses, feeling like an International citizen,\
  \ sitting in the sand\u2026 eating spicy food above a clean sky even when I never\
  \ thought that I would stay that much in the dessert, next to a calm camel and enjoying\
  \ the company of a bunch of incredible people that connects with me not because\
  \ of the language, we connect because of the happiness that we are feeling right\
  \ now staying here, eating in a small pillow inside a tend. \nI can\u2019t find\
  \ the words to explain this feeling and I think that every single citizen of the\
  \ world should experiment things like this because the world is OURS and experiences\
  \ like this can\u2019t be limited by simple frontiers."
