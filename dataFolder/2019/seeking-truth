Text: "Seeking Truth\n\nI\u2019ve spent the better part of my forty-four year life\
  \ listening to society\u2019s take on other countries and cultures. I\u2019ve watched\
  \ the news, read the paper and of course, until recently, allowed social media to\
  \ sway my opinions of where and how I am supposed to \u201Csafely\u201D spend my\
  \ time traveling. \nI finally took a stand. For 3 months now, my wife, two children\
  \ and myself have been traveling Asia on our way west around the globe to eventually\
  \ end up back in Alberta, Canada in roughly seven and a half months from our departure\
  \ date from Edmonton. I\u2019ve always wondered how the world really worked. How\
  \ Asia differed from the middle east. How western Canada differed from Europe. Peoples\
  \ views of the world stage are so diverse that forming an educated stance on what\
  \ to believe can be impossible with limited experience. Asking a friend from small\
  \ town Alberta who recently traveled to an all-inclusive resort in Phuket, Thailand\
  \ for week with their sister is not a fail-safe way to gather intel on how simple\
  \ and chill the people of Thailand live. Clicking on a blog that does hotel reviews\
  \ for westerners traveling to Japan, is in no way the right method to conclude that\
  \ the beds in Tokyo are incredibly hard.\nI decided that it would be best for my\
  \ family and I to see and feel first hand, the warmth and caring if the Thai culture\
  \ and, yes, how incredibly hard the beds are in Tokyo. These were but a couple of\
  \ experiences that we wished to check off on our three-quarter year journey from\
  \ China to Spain via Canada. We wished to smell the smells. To hear the languages\
  \ and of course to taste the food. \nWe are a little under half complete, our tiny\
  \ piece of the world\u2019s pie and the one thing I didn\u2019t expect to find is\u2026\
  \nWE ARE ALL THE SAME.\nLanding in Beijing on November 7th, our senses were absolutely\
  \ overloaded with the exact things we set out to expose ourselves to. The language,\
  \ the smells and the food all hit us at once. We stayed huddled in our room for\
  \ the next couple of days unsure of how we were to go about communicating with the\
  \ Chinese people on the other side of our wall. Jet lag was but a mere excuse for\
  \ the fact that we were feeling WAY over our head here and this is only day one.\
  \ Coming from a town of less than 1000 people in Northern Alberta, Canada and dropping\
  \ ourselves in a city of 22,000,000, we knew that we had made our bed and now we\
  \ have to lie in it.\nAs we slowly made our way out of the confines of our Air B&B\
  \ apartment and onto the streets of one of the top most populated cities in the\
  \ world, we started to realize something. \nThere are vehicles making their way\
  \ through the streets. Some people are headed to work and some are on days off.\
  \ The coffee shop on the corner is serving coffee and the traffic lights are red\
  \ and green. Shop owners are cleaning up from the night before so as to create an\
  \ inviting atmosphere for the patrons of this day.\nAs we make our way west and\
  \ subsequently into Thailand from which I now write this, our main take away so\
  \ far is that WE ARE ALL THE SAME. One people under a God of their choice with ambition\
  \ and a will to live and thrive. Though our language, physical appearance and geography\
  \ all differ from each other, our LOVE of family, our passion for our country and\
  \ our simple sense of creating a positive atmosphere for each other wherever we\
  \ may be is EXACTLY the same. No matter where we are in the world. \nTraveling has\
  \ opened our eyes to the beauty and diversity of the world but most of all it has\
  \ shown us that we are all here for the same purpose. The differences around the\
  \ globe are far outweighed by the similarities. Take hold of that chance you have.\
  \ NOW.  Seek truth\u2026"
