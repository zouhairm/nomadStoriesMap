Text: "\u201CHi, can you help us?\u201D My guitar playing stopped abruptly and I looked\
  \ up. In front of me stood four young people. Three guys and a girl. I knew straight\
  \ away who they were from their dishevelled appearance, tanned skin and large hiking\
  \ packs on their backs. They were Shvilstim, which is the Hebrew word given to those\
  \ who walk the Israel national trail. This is a hike that takes around two months\
  \ to complete and covers the length of the entire country.\nI was currently volunteering\
  \ at the Shelter Hostel in Eilat, Israel. The hostel offered those who had completed\
  \ the Israel trail the chance to stay one night for free and young Israelis were\
  \ arriving almost every day to make use of this offer. \n\u201CSure I can help,\u201D\
  \ I said laying down the guitar and hopping off my seat. I loved meeting the Shvilistim.\
  \ At this time of the year, they had usually finished the hike when they arrived\
  \ at the hostel and I was in awe of their dedication and love of their country.\
  \ I myself couldn\u2019t imagine doing such a lengthy trek.  \n\u201CSo, you\u2019\
  ve been hiking the Israel trail?\u201D I commented as we made our way to the office.\
  \ \n\u201CYes, we just finished it today.\u201D the girl answered proudly for the\
  \ group. Her brown eyes glowed and her wavy dark hair was pulled away from her face\
  \ with a colourful scarf.\n\u201CCongratulations, that\u2019s awesome!\u201D I said\
  \ enthusiastically. \u201CHow long did it take you?\u201D \n\u201CAbout two months,\u201D\
  \ one of the guys replied, running a hand through his dark beard.\n\u201CTwo months,\u201D\
  \ I breathed. \u201CAnd I thought I was doing well when I completed a four day hike!\
  \ You must be so happy to be finished.\u201D\n\u201CWell I would just really like\
  \ a shower,\u201D the girl said smiling. \u201CThen I can think about celebrating!\u201D\
  \ We all laughed at this. \nI was checking them in when the office door opened and\
  \ a blond head appeared in the doorway. It was John, the owner of the hostel. Originally\
  \ from Holland, he and his American wife Judy had been running the hostel for the\
  \ past thirty years and were now in their seventies. \n\u201CHello!\u201D he greeted\
  \ the group enthusiastically before switching effortlessly into Hebrew, one of the\
  \ many languages he spoke fluently. It never ceased to amaze me how someone could\
  \ remain so fresh and friendly after being surrounded by foreigners and strangers\
  \ for so many years. I tuned back in as John changed into English. \u201CSo, you\
  \ will join us for dinner tonight? We are making pita and having a party. A party\
  \ because you have just finished the Shvil!\u201D John enthused, using the Hebrew\
  \ word for the trail.\nI chuckled to myself when I saw the Israelis slightly confused\
  \ look. The \u201Cparty\u201D tonight was in fact for three of the volunteers who\
  \ were leaving the next day, but John loved the opportunity to say that it was \u201C\
  especially for those who had just finished the trail.\u201D \n\nLater that evening\
  \ found a group of us all sitting on mats outside. John had made pitas on a fire-pit\
  \ and his wife Judy had provided delicious homemade hummus and labneh. Once the\
  \ pitas were cooked, we roasted corn on the fire. \nI sat there under the stars,\
  \ with the aroma of the food and the different languages swirling around me and\
  \ it struck me as to what a special place the Shelter Hostel was. Here I was, a\
  \ kiwi from New Zealand, surrounded by people from Israel, Germany, Russia, Holland,\
  \ Canada, Slovakia and America. \nAnd even though I was very far from home, at that\
  \ moment I couldn\u2019t have been happier and I realised that what is so important\
  \ is the connection you make with people. Finding that common ground even when at\
  \ first you all seem so different.  Some of us were little more than strangers,\
  \ we were all from very different countries and backgrounds, but on that November\
  \ evening in the south of Israel, we all came together and were united by good food,\
  \ conversation and a shared love of travelling. And I realised that it really didn\u2019\
  t take that much to make a meaningful connection after all."
