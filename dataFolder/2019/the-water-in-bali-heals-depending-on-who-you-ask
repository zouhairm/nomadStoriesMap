Text: "A phenomenon observed and understood is that when an elephant dies, its relatives\
  \ make a pilgrimage to its bones. There they encircle it, they mourn, and they lament\
  \ their loss.\nI imagine the oldest member of any tribe having the biggest impact,\
  \ drawing the largest herd to his body. \nThis thought runs through my head as I\
  \ prepare to return to Ghana for the funeral of my Grandfather.  \nI was days out\
  \ from a trip to Indonesia when I heard. The plan was to spend three weeks exploring\
  \ and not to think too much on my grandfather\u2019s passing. But it leaked in,\
  \ in drips and in then in spurts.\nI arrived soon in the verdant countryside of\
  \ Bali, Indonesia. As we drove, the vines and bushes seemed to grow so far into\
  \ the road that they threaten to block your vision! In the predominantly Muslim\
  \ country, the tall statues of Ganesh at almost every intersection made me stop\
  \ and stare. \nWhen you meander down the narrow streets dodging mopeds and stray\
  \ dogs, you must also keep an eye down for the small and carefully folded baskets\
  \ made from palm leaves. \nCanang sari are daily offerings left to the Balinese\
  \ Hindu gods, in praise and worship. They are often filled with rice, candy and\
  \ flowers. Most often I saw strays and ants feasting on the contents.\nOn the first\
  \ night, we arrived to find hundreds of ants scrambling busily over our bed\u2019\
  s canopy. The hotel attendant laughed heartily and responded to my concerned questions,\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s because we\u2019re in nature, you know?\u201D\nThe next day, our\
  \ driver pulled up in a white SUV. He jumped out, straightened his polo shirt and\
  \ extended his hand up to me with a warm smile. His name was Budi. During our short\
  \ ride, he had shown us an entire booklet of tours around Bali. \nOne place that\
  \ stood out was Tirta Empul. Budi explained that it was an important temple for\
  \ Balinese Hinduism. It boasted a natural fresh water spring, considered holy, with\
  \ purification and healing properties. \u201CWell, depending on who you ask\u201D\
  , he joked. The idea of being absolved of all worries did appeal to me though.\n\
  To enter the temple, you must wrap a Kamben, a type of sarong, around the lower\
  \ half of your body. We followed Budi inside, noting that the almost constant birdsong\
  \ of Bali seemed muted. He pointed out the well-sculpted gardens of the Indonesian\
  \ presidential residence on a hill overlooking the temple. It seemed at odds with\
  \ the discoloured, aged stones that made up the temple walls. \nOnce inside the\
  \ central courtyard, you could see the source of the spring, fresh water bubbling\
  \ up from underground. It cascaded through stone tunnels towards the purification\
  \ baths. There, thirteen altar-like spouts pumped water into a large rectangular\
  \ bath. The stones were well coated in moss, making them slippery to the touch and\
  \ obscuring some of the finer detailing cut into each fountain. \nI dipped my toe\
  \ in and instantly pulled back. Despite thick humidity, you could feel the chill\
  \ of the water. As I began to lower myself in, dressed in a special swimming type\
  \ of Kamben, I noticed that the pool was teeming with koi fish. I tensed, absurdly\
  \ afraid that I\u2019d slip and step on a fish. \nThis fear kept me passenger as\
  \ I lowered my head beneath the first of the thirteen spouts and allowed the water\
  \ to gush fervently over my shoulders. I remained there for a few moments, feeling\
  \ my shoulders slide down my back. I entered the next fountain without any fear.\
  \ \nAll at once, I found tears on my cheeks. Then I was coughing and shaking, concealed\
  \ by the flow of water.\nMy Grandpa was gone. \nI closed my eyes and said a wordless\
  \ prayer, hoping that he was happy and that he was in the heaven he had always believed\
  \ in so faithfully. I hoped that a Christian god would see me, look past the Hindu\
  \ temple and grant my sincere wishes.\nAs we left, Budi asked jokingly \u201CSo,\
  \ do you feel any different after the purifying?\u201D I gave him a small smile,\
  \ saying nothing but feeling the start of healing."
