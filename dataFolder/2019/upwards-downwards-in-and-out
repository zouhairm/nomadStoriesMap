Text: "Bosnia uphill, and before my eyes a small metal screw winding its way down,\
  \ down into the Croatian foothills. It had fallen from my bicycle.\n\n\u201CBetter\
  \ take the chance to travel while I can,\u201D I had thought. A British passport\
  \ in hand and bicycle between my knees, I cared less about the lines marking borders\
  \ on the map than about the contours which forecast a steep hill, or the enclosure\
  \ of a town square, promising an espresso, and the chance to moan about Brexit in\
  \ brighter sunshine than I was used to in England. \n\nAnd now I was heading upwards\
  \ to Bosnia, geographically European, politically not in the union. Laden with an\
  \ imprudent amount of luggage on a groaning bicycle, I couldn\u2019t be bothered\
  \ to get off and chase the escaping screw. Hopefully it wasn\u2019t an integral\
  \ part of the machinery. See-sawing on, my panniers creaked and sighed, each turn\
  \ of the pedal breaking the stillness between the fir-lined slopes of the Dinaric\
  \ Alps. \n\nDusk and sweat in my eyes from the long journey made my exit from Europe\
  \ dim. Stinging white grape liquor, which I had been offered freely along the road,\
  \ deepened the sway in my cycling and softened the crossing at the first hard border\
  \ I had come to. I managed only a short distance up into Bosnia and Herzegovina\
  \ before I spotted an empty house by the roadside. Perfect - no need to put up the\
  \ tent. \n\nMorning, and I blinked to find the face of my makeshift hotel was scattered\
  \ with bullet-marks. I guessed these were a legacy of Bosnia\u2019s war, a sharp\
  \ wake-up call, even if they were more than twenty years old. They were the first\
  \ I would see. I felt the lonely euphoria of rushing down the other side of the\
  \ mountain range, breaking through the trees into the vastness of an empty plain,\
  \ where scores of empty houses, gaping windows and pockmarked walls stood lonely\
  \ under purple clouds, waiting to receive me.\n\nI was relieved to come to my first\
  \ inhabited town in the country, and to find that the Rakia still flowed freely,\
  \ hard border or no. I couldn\u2019t resist asking my drinking companion: \u201C\
  Croat, Serb, Muslim?\u201D \u201CCroat,\u201D he told me, and he couldn\u2019t resist\
  \ an eye-roll at the question. \u201CBut it\u2019s not important, that\u2019s only\
  \ on the TV and stuff.\u201D For Niko, the cultural legacy of the war was mainly\
  \ an annoyance, an administrative tedium that meant it took over a year for the\
  \ three separate sections of government, which represent the country\u2019s three\
  \ ethnicities, to return a paper as part of its EU membership application. \n\n\
  He guided me up the road, past signs in Roman, Arabic and Cyrillic scripts, to the\
  \ outskirts of his hometown of Livno. We crouched in the dark where a spring gushed\
  \ out of a bare cliff-face, and we sipped from the water filtering through the rocks,\
  \ a tonic to the heat of the grape-liquor. Families were leaving a mosque into the\
  \ lamplight on the opposite bank, heading home after breaking their Ramadan fast.\
  \ \n\n\u201CLook up,\u201D Niko told me. Caves hidden in the cliffs above dated\
  \ back to Illyrian tribes and had hosted prayers and sleepers and playing children\
  \ back through periods of Ottoman, Slavic, and Roman settlement.\n\nHe had recently\
  \ graduated, and like me, would be looking for a job. He studied in Croatia, and\
  \ now his sights were set on Germany. \u201CYou can\u2019t get work if you don\u2019\
  t speak German,\u201D he said, and he did speak German, as well as Russian, English,\
  \ and several others. \u201CThere\u2019s not a lot to do here\u201D he laughed in\
  \ explanation. The economy is fucked, Niko said, youth unemployment, refugee population.\
  \ He thought joining the EU is the only choice. \n\nOn the bus from Heathrow, I\
  \ began to catch up with the news. Junker issued a warning to Bosnian leaders to\
  \ \u201Covercome their differences\u201D if they wanted in. Theresa May marked out\
  \ what set Britain apart. \n\nAnd finally onto the bike to cycle home. Niko\u2019\
  s parting gift to me had been a small, metal screw."
