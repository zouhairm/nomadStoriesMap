Text: "It is a six-hour flight crossing Africa from Cairo to Tangier. Africa, the\
  \ continent I was born in, but never explored. Now that I will be leaving for a\
  \ long journey of self-discovery, I decided to give it a goodbye kiss. \nWhy Morocco?\
  \  Maybe I wanted to cross to the other end of Africa and face the Atlantic Ocean?\
  \ I wanted to see how this special part of Africa evolved with exposure to European,\
  \ Spanish, and Andalusia civilizations. I wanted to understand how it's African,\
  \ Arabic, Amazigh, and Andalusian history blended together. \nMy plane landed in\
  \ Tangier, I was eager to explore the city where Hercules hid and Tarek ibn Ziyad\
  \ stood and spotted Spain. Captivated by its beauty he decided to cross, starting\
  \ the Andalusian Era. This controversial era is viewed by some historians as bloody\
  \ and oppressive and by others as the foundation of the European Renaissance.  Regardless,\
  \ it was an Era that produced prominent philosophers, unique architecture, and enchanting\
  \ music that is still vibrant today in Morocco and Spain. \nIn Tangier, I chose\
  \ to stay with a local. I picked a simple Dar in the Old Medina. As I walked by\
  \ old stones, colorful ceramics, and children playing in the narrow alleys, I heard\
  \ an Acapella singing group, then I discovered it was Moroccan women singing and\
  \ dancing in a traditional wedding in the Dar next to mine. There were thrills of\
  \ joy and I had the chance to share the moment. We had conversations about heritage,\
  \ traditions as well as the challenges and insecurities. The Dar was an old Moroccan\
  \ traditional house that had been converted by the owner\u2019s to a guest house\
  \ for tourists to explore Tangier. Sitting in Fina El Dar, the traditional courtyard,\
  \ I imagined all the celebrations and tough moments these ancient walls have witnessed.\
  \ \nAfter Tangier, I traveled to Chefchaouen, known as Morocco\u2019s blue pearl\
  \ for its beautiful blue old houses, hills, and waterfalls. As I arrived in the\
  \ city, I was captivated by its calming ambiance. I reached the old house I chose\
  \ to stay in and was greeted with complimentary Moroccan lemon mint on my arrival.\
  \ The old man at the reception told me the secret, the city\u2019s blue color and\
  \ calm spirit was intended to praise God and create a feeling of serenity. He invited\
  \ me to a Darwish-like night of praising where old men sang enchanting hymns about\
  \ the love of God. It was abstract, beautiful, not tied to one religion; rather\
  \ a sensational experience of peace between God, humanity and the universe. A night\
  \ I shall never forget.\nOn my second day in Chefchaouen, I decided to try hiking\
  \ in the nearby mountains and see the waterfalls of Akchour.  After an hour taking\
  \ wrong paths, I stopped at the nearest caf\xE9 to ask for help. In Akchour, a caf\xE9\
  \ is a few plastic tables and chairs in the middle of the waterfalls. You sit with\
  \ half of your body in the water and drink mint tea, an exquisite experience. After\
  \ drinking my tea, the caf\xE9 owner offered his eleven-year-old son to guide me\
  \ through the mountains. At first, I was not sure following an eleven-year-old was\
  \ a wise idea.  I decided to break the ice; asking him which grade he was is and\
  \ what he likes to do. He answered I go to school, but I enjoy guiding people here\
  \ in my mountain in the summer. But then all of a sudden, Ayman, my little guide\
  \ looked into my eyes and said in a confident tone you are not doubting my abilities\
  \ miss, you are doubting yourself. You think and overthink every step, yet adventurous\
  \ hikers don\u2019t do that, rather they visualize their dream, think of the beautiful\
  \ falls and the two mountains bridge at the end of the falls, then bravely follow\
  \ their heart with little guidance. I felt courageous or maybe curious to follow\
  \ Ayman. After 3.5 hours, a few falls and one scar; I reached the end of Akchour\
  \ falls and saw the breathtaking scenery. It was one of the most fulfilling moments\
  \ I experienced and a valuable unexpected lesson to me. This trip was life-changing\
  \ at a pivotal point in my life."
