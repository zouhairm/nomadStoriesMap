Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s beginning to look a lot like Christmas\u201D, except it was\
  \ February and not a present in sight! Boarding a flight to Kittila, I didn\u2019\
  t expect to land in a Christmas card. I stared out the plane window, the world had\
  \ turned white. Tina met me at the airport, a long way from Africa where we first\
  \ met. \n\nI soon realised the clothes I packed were far from Lapland worthy! On\
  \ route to the house, we stopped at a Finnish supermarket. I enjoy wandering around\
  \ foreign markets, trying to guess what\u2019s inside the packets. Outside, the\
  \ car park was not just for cars. It had allocated spots for dogs (koiraparkki)\
  \ and sleds (potkukelkkaparkki). Thank goodness for the illustrated signage! \n\n\
  Tina worked as a tour guide, leading people through the snow on husky pulled sleds.\
  \ The house she lived in was made of wood, with an indoor sauna and a cupboard full\
  \ of processed foods. Apparently, the weather has a tendency to stop them from shopping!\
  \ Knowing that clothes were optional in the sauna tested my Australian courage but\
  \ I\u2019m not one to say no to a new experience. I wrapped myself in a towel and\
  \ sat in the sauna with Tina. Afterwards we ran naked in the snow (apparently it\u2019\
  s a tradition!) OK\u2026 I wasn\u2019t naked, I was still wrapped in the towel and\
  \ I had over-sized boots on my feet, that snow is way too cold! \n\nThe yard was\
  \ separated into areas, each section enclosed with wire fencing. Little head holes,\
  \ connected to food bowls, were at shin level along all the paths. As hundreds of\
  \ little husky heads popped out of each hole waiting for their food, meal time was\
  \ a sight to see! One section of the yard was full of puppies and as each one jumped\
  \ up competing for pats, my heart was full and my face hurt from grinning (or the\
  \ sub-zero temperatures!) Everything was a novelty for me, I even happily joined\
  \ my friend on the roof to shovel the snow! \n\n\u201CLet it snow, let it snow,\
  \ let it snow\u201D. I\u2019m not going to lie, my mind sang Christmas carols for\
  \ the whole week, enough to drive anyone mad! Considering I come from Australia,\
  \ where Christmas is a 40\u2019 day, beach walks and pool parties, it\u2019s amazing\
  \ how snowy Christmas cards and carols can subliminally influence our minds over\
  \ the years! \u201CDashing through the snow, in an eight dog open sleigh, over the\
  \ hills we go, laughing all the way\u201D. I tailor-made my own carols, it seemed\
  \ fitting at the time!\n\nDays were spent sledding, walking and skidoo\u2019ing\
  \ through Lapland, surrounded by snow covered trees, passing reindeer and long-haired\
  \ ponies. If I ever got lost, the street signs would have been useless as none could\
  \ be read through the layers of snow. I learned that igloos are surprisingly warm\
  \ inside and how to make snow angels. We went for a walk one day to a river where\
  \ the temperature gauge read -15\u2019C. I took a photo of this river, and aside\
  \ from our brightly coloured clothing, the picture looked like a black and white\
  \ image.\n\nThe few hours of daylight were sandwiched between extra hours of dusk\
  \ and dawn and I was full of anticipation. I wanted to see the Northern lights.\
  \ Night after night, I waited. Night after night, it was overcast and cloudy! However,\
  \ during the day the sky was mostly clear and blue with the snow flakes glittering\
  \ in the sunlight like angel dust! \n\nMy trip had come to an end. We managed one\
  \ last adventure on the way to the airport as we slid the van off the road on our\
  \ way to buy more chocolate! I made my flight though, and as the airline staff de-iced\
  \ the plane, I reflected on my trip in the ultimate Christmas Card / Winter Wonderland.\
  \ As the plane took off and we ascended above the clouds, I looked out of the window\
  \ at the magic that is the Northern Lights. Green streaks illuminated the sky. And\
  \ with that, my trip was over."
