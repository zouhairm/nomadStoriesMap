Text: "It's the third day that the balloons flight is cancelled due to the wind. The\
  \ list of people waiting to live the lifetime experience is growing bigger. Some\
  \ have already left without being able to do it. I am just arriving to Cappadocia\
  \ and this panorama makes me forget my resistance to take the flight because I thought\
  \ it might be clich\xE9. But that prejudice disappears as I find myself surrounded\
  \ by giant versions of the castles I made as a child with wet sand, the earthy tones\
  \ mixing like melted ice cream: pink, yellow, white. In this distant and infinite\
  \ planet no sensation can be clich\xE9. As I was told, there are not many women\
  \ traveling alone. But I am determined to enjoy every corner on my own and encourage\
  \ all those who warned me against coming to travel.\n\nI book place in the balloon\
  \ flight for the three following days. That delays my visit to G\xF6reme Open-Air\
  \ Museum. I mention this to Max, who welcomes me in the hotel where I'll sleep \xA1\
  in a fairy chimney! He leaves the check-in unfinished and grabs his car keys.\n\u2013\
  Fifteen minutes for the last entrance \u2013he says as he indicates me to follow\
  \ him.\nWe arrive just in time and I get in after thanking Max for a gesture that\
  \ I find kind, but also homely, protective. I walk around stones rounded by years,\
  \ wind and history that guard amazing human creations. Cave chapels that are still\
  \ alive in the murals that surround me.\nMy first day ends on a terrace with colorful\
  \ cushions and cats. I enjoy the warmth and aroma of my Turkish tea. The Islamic\
  \ call to prayer rises like the wind among the silhouettes that the ancient shapes\
  \ project in the night of this enchanted city.\n\n5:30 am. My alarm clock rings.\
  \ Once again, the balloons flight is cancelled for weather conditions. I explore\
  \ Rose Valley and the formations of Pasabag Valley, which everyone insists in calling\
  \ mushrooms because they don\u2019t dare to say what they really look like...\n\
  In the afternoon I face the biggest challenge for my claustrophobia: the underground\
  \ city of Derinkuyu. The idea that it housed thousands of inhabitants thanks to\
  \ ventilation shafts helps me to continue going down, stooping along its corridors.\n\
  \n5 am. Call to prayer wakes me up. I run to the meeting point for the balloon flight\
  \ and it seems we are lucky today. We feel that a small movement can ruin everything.\
  \ And although we stand still, the wind moves... and the flight is canceled.\nI\
  \ only have one last chance.\nWith anxiety and spare time, I decide to walk to U\xE7\
  hisar Castle instead of taking a bus. There are no travelers on the path, just a\
  \ few locals working on their squash crops or feeding huge chickens. After two hours\
  \ walking, climbing and crossing through houses made in the caves of the road, I\
  \ arrive. As I reach the top, from where my starting point cannot even be seen,\
  \ I savor the reward of the path that I will keep as a personal treasure.\n\n4.30\
  \ am. Stars shine as I dress up. At the meeting point I see Frank and Ema, a couple\
  \ of old English anthropologists with whom I spoke yesterday.\nAnd then it happens.\n\
  We get to the field where the half-inflated balloons look like sleeping giants,\
  \ their faces squished against the floor. Each puff of air is a yawn that awakens\
  \ them. The sky lightens as they stand up. I'm the only one who is alone: baskets\
  \ compartments are taken by couples, families, groups. Frank and Ema come with me.\n\
  Despite the excitement, we remain silent. Our balloon sails between the pale valleys\
  \ that await the sunlight. What happens next takes our breath away: as we surpass\
  \ these first formations, an infinite dawn, blue, pink and orange holds dozens of\
  \ balloons floating like bubbles of this dream world. Frank and Ema share the moment\
  \ speaking softly. They look at my eyes, so opened that they can\u2019t release\
  \ the tears. And they talk to me. \nMaybe it\u2019s true. Maybe I shouldn\u2019\
  t have come alone. This is too big not to be shared."
