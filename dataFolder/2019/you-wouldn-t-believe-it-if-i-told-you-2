Text: "Rough draft #2. \n\n It was a feeling I couldn\u2019t shake.  Though 9000 miles\
  \ of land and sea wedged between my Cozy Cabin at the base of daunting Mount Shasta,\
  \ California and the fire-red sunset common in the expanse of the Masai-Mara safari\
  \ lands in southern Kenya.  Was I being watched? Was someone  keeping an eye on\
  \ me? \n\nMy loyal traveling companion, affectionately known as \u2018Ms.B\u2019\
  , was getting accustomed to us being just about the only tourists to venture out\
  \ since the post-election violence stole Kenya\u2019s peace in recent months.  \
  \ In a country known for friendly eco-tourism, the near civil war left behind a\
  \ wide swathe of contention, fear, distrust, and moral violation, hence, several\
  \ of the safari camps we stayed in were empty, save us and the dedicated men who\
  \ staffed the petite uncrowded camps. Us gals were spoiled.  I could get used to\
  \ this ratio! After all, this was one of the more extraordinary adventures for Old\
  \ Maids for Christ, Madame Presidente and my side-kick, the unpretentious V. P.\
  \ , Ms.  B. \n\nThis long awaited trip was supposed to get us away from the busy\
  \ schedules we both kept as single women. When I checked in at the dust- covered\
  \ podium and signed the guest book with my formal name, city/state and country,\
  \ little did I know there was something special about the two retired couples just\
  \ in from fog-laden San Francivsco. Coincidence? Nah!  California is an enormous\
  \ state. Yet something jaw- dropping happened that night as they joined us for dinner.\
  \ \n\nAs is customary, my attention was focused on the investigative questions that\
  \ were on auto-pilot composing in my brain. I\u2019m off the clock, I banter with\
  \ myself, yet the curios of travel always beckons. Who were these folks, and little\
  \ did I know I was just about to be figuratively \u2018knocked off my feet.\u2019\
  \n\nOne of the two tanned, white- haired chaps strolled over to me with his right\
  \ hand eagerly extended for \u2018The Handshake.\u2019 It was clear from the twinkle\
  \ in his eyes, this fellow obviously had something exciting to say and it was going\
  \ to burst out any minute. The suspense was killing me. \n\n\u201CHey, aren\u2019\
  t you the dog trainer from Mount Shasta? You trained my friend John Grogan\u2019\
  s dog and I met you at Lalo\u2019s Mexican Restaurant \nawhile back!\u201D  \n\n\
  My jaw dropped, my heart skipped and I couldn\u2019t believe what I just heard!\
  \ No wonder the gentleman had been staring at me. Sure. My client lives up by the\
  \ high school and his now-older fuzzy- faced  canine loves to lay out in the street\
  \ on the broad road that borders the school.  \n\nThe lesson for me was instantaneous.\
  \ Never-ever am I outside of the gaze of my Father in Heaven. King David mentioned\
  \ in Psalm 139:7-10 Where shall I go from Your Spirit?\n    Or where shall I flee\
  \ from Your presence?\nIf I ascend to heaven, you are there!\n    If I make my bed\
  \ in Sheol, you are there!\nIf I take the wings of the morning\n    and dwell in\
  \ the uttermost parts of the sea,\neven there Your hand shall lead me,\n    and\
  \ Your right hand shall hold me.\u201D\n\nSee, I knew I was being watched!  Never\
  \ am I out of my Creator\u2019s watchful sight!  He had a way to make me laugh hard\
  \ and deep and unashamedly, even as the night sounds of the \u2018bush\u2019 begin\
  \ their symphony. Next time you sense someone is eye-balling you, pause and know\
  \ it is always the One who is the Lover of your soul. \n\nCopyright Sooz Waller\
