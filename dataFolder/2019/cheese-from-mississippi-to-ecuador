Text: "In 1942 a young man traveled to the United States to learn to make cheese.\
  \ He ended up in a small town in Mississippi, met a local girl; they married and\
  \ had a son. Alas, the two young lovers were destined to part due to a series of\
  \ unfortunate events. \nSeventy years later, a Facebook search for cheese-making\
  \ in Ecuador brought up an old photograph--a photo of a young man in Mississippi.\
  \ The same photo the son had kept for more than 70 years as a memory of a father\
  \ he had never known. Now an old man, he contacted the person who had posted the\
  \ photograph. \nIn minutes, he had found family members who had memories of their\
  \ grandfather talking about his time in the United States and of a young son he\
  \ had left behind as an infant.\nA few months later, he traveled to Ecuador to meet\
  \ a family he had never known. \nWhen two young men and two young women walked into\
  \ the hotel in Quito, the old man saw younger versions of himself in the eyes, the\
  \ hair, the hands, and faces. The nephews and nieces saw a man who was the image\
  \ of their grandfather. \nAnd the story continues..."
