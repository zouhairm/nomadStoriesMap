Text: "\u201CThe sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever.\u201D\
  \ \n~Jacque Yves Cousteau   \n\nI am born of the sea, of the crashing waves and\
  \ the warm white sand.  I am one with the sound of the gulls and the smell of the\
  \ ocean and of the creatures that dwell within. \n\nWell, not exactly. I grew up\
  \ on a farm in rural east Texas in a time when there were only three television\
  \ channels. But once a week, I was a mermaid when I watched The Undersea World of\
  \ Jacque Cousteau and true to his quote, am forever in awe of its wonder. \n\nAfter\
  \ I had a daughter, Lauren, I continued my lust for the briny realm with most of\
  \ our outings centered around beaches, aquariums and any other venue where we could\
  \ get our deep-sea fix. We were bonded by our love of the sea and I wasn\u2019t\
  \ surprised when she inherited my oceanic fascination or that she collected little\
  \ wooden and glass sea turtles. \n\nLast Summer, Lauren asked me to go to Kauai\
  \ to help with her two children ages two and eight. I thought I hadn\u2019t heard\
  \ her right and turned off my white noise ocean sounds and asked her to repeat herself.\
  \ This destination was strategically chosen and the trip carefully planned around\
  \ her early second-semester pregnancy with her lifelong goal of seeing a sea turtle\
  \ in its natural environment.  \n\nMy most important pre-trip task was to find some\
  \ way of transferring our passion to the youngest female in our flotilla, two-year-old\
  \ Dylan. I did what any good Grandmother would do and bought her a Moana costume\
  \ to wear as we watched the movie non-stop. As time went by, our anticipation grew\
  \ at the same pace as our luggage. \n\nTwo days before the trip, Lauren went for\
  \ her routine prenatal check-up. \u201CThere\u2019s no heartbeat\u201D, she told\
  \ me still in shock since she had heard it just weeks before.  I was in denial and\
  \ unbelievably sad. The doctor said the baby had evidently perished shortly after\
  \ the last visit and travelling before she miscarried would almost certainly end\
  \ in the emergency room and advised her against it. Lauren then went home to grieve.\
  \ \n\nAll of us had resigned to staying home anticipating the inevitable miscarriage.\
  \ Later that evening, her doctor called. She had moved her scheduled around so she\
  \ could perform emergency surgery which would allow her to recover on vacation.\
  \ I know it wasn\u2019t easy but Lauren put on a brave face and the next day, we\
  \ were overpacked and on our way. \n\nAs soon as we stepped off the airplane, the\
  \ warm damp breeze wafted with the sweet smell of tropical flowers and salt water.\
  \ The lush landscape and gorgeous greenery set the backdrop for the tropical flora\
  \ and reminded me of my Uncle Bob\u2019s favorite shirt. \n\nLauren skillfully and\
  \ strategically scheduled and paced our time so we could see the most sites and\
  \ visit the beach every day where sea turtles were commonly sighted.\n\nOn the second\
  \ day, we ended up in the emergency room with Dylan, who was hallucinating. If you\
  \ have never seen or heard a toddler talk to herself in third person it is very\
  \ scary. Our minds raced as we thought the worst, but she was just sleep deprived\
  \ from the seven-hour time difference.  \n\nWe were beginning to think we struck\
  \ out, then on the day before we left, we walked the beach in silence as Dylan ran\
  \ between us and we happened upon not one, but two turtles. Lauren ran like a little\
  \ girl, throwing off her flip-flops to go faster.  She respected the signs and distance\
  \ then laid down on the sand next to one of the turtles. As I neared, the skies\
  \ opened and it began to rain. With the sacrifices she had made to get here and\
  \ the grief she still carried, I believed that could be nothing more that tears\
  \ from heaven. \n\nAs we departed, Dylan happily carried her purple mermaid doll\
  \ though the airport. \u201CI want to stay in Moana World and live on the beach\u201D\
  , she said. Lauren\u2019s eyes caught mine as we simultaneously smiled. The torch\
  \ has passed."
