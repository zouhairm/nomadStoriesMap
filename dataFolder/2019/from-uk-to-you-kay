Text: "I arrive in Hanoi and start sweating immediately. This is what 80% humidity\
  \ feels like. Streams of scooters whiz past with a language made up of horns and\
  \ beeps: I\u2019m stood trying to cross the road when a man swipes my trainer off\
  \ my foot and quickly starts cleaning it. I look down at the finished product and\
  \ it\u2019s practically glowing. \n \n\u201CThanks\u201D I say. \n \n\u201CPay\u201D\
  \ he says, whilst trying to wiggle the second trainer off my foot. \n \n\u201COh\
  \ no, thanks, I don\u2019t want\u2026sorry, I never asked you to - \u201C\n \nI\u2019\
  m walking around Hanoi with the cleanest trainer of all time, and the other covered\
  \ in layers of traveller\u2019s dirt. It\u2019s a look. \n \nWith my freshly cleaned\
  \ crep, I start exploring the streets for some famous Vietnamese food. There\u2019\
  s an amazing amount of choice with fresh smells wafting out of doorways and side\
  \ streets. I spot a lady beckoning me towards her. I go with it. Next thing I know\
  \ I\u2019m in her front room sat next to (I\u2019m assuming) her Dad, who looks\
  \ like he\u2019s hitting 90. He\u2019s smiling and chuckling at me, and I nervously\
  \ laugh back.\n \nSuddenly realise this isn\u2019t a caf\xE9. \n \nThe lady is excitedly\
  \ whizzing around and sits me down at a little table with a tiny stool and brings\
  \ out fresh food. It\u2019s my first day in Vietnam and I can\u2019t identity what\
  \ anything is. Doubled over with my knees up to my chin, I politely tuck in. Gramps\
  \ bursts into hysterical fits of laughter as I try to manoeuvre some chop sticks.\
  \ I eat the leaves meant for the pho like a caesar salad and he\u2019s practically\
  \ on the floor. I finish up, smile with bits of basil between my teeth and offer\
  \ some Dong as a thanks before heading off to find a spa. \n \nEveryone raves about\
  \ the massages in Vietnam, and as someone who has never had one, I was in a pretty\
  \ good city to try. TripAdvisor stars decorate the rows of Hanoi\u2019s spas and\
  \ I head into one with great bamboo exterior and lanterns. It\u2019s an instant\
  \ calm to the liveliness of the city at its doorstep and I\u2019m greeted with welcoming\
  \ faces of staff, a tray of tea, and a lengthy menu of massages.\n \nDidn\u2019\
  t quite realise there were so many massages in the world. \n \nChoose one at random.\
  \ \n \nI\u2019m then introduced to my masseuse, a tiny, beautiful Vietnamese lady\
  \ who takes me to a room that\u2019s filled with scented smoke and calming water\
  \ trickles. There\u2019s a little pair of silk shorts on the table. She gestures\
  \ to them and gracefully walks out. I take everything off and put the shorts on,\
  \ standing aimlessly half naked in the room. \n \nThe lady walks in and starts the\
  \ massage. \n \n\u201CYou kay\u201D she gently says to me every now and again, to\
  \ which I reply:\n \n\u201CYes, thanks\u201D \n \nThe inconspicuous meaty pho plays\
  \ back on me and I start sweating. The masseuse moves further down my back before\
  \ pausing at the silk pants. She rolls them up like a scroll between my arse cheeks\
  \ and starts needing my buttocks like dough. The rhythmic patterns get increasingly\
  \ intense and I\u2019m getting dangerously close to a fart.\n \nI\u2019m tensing.\
  \ She stops. Pauses. And in one movement pulls out a hair from my bum. \n(NOTE:\
  \ As a woman with long hair, it\u2019s common that after showering, hairs from your\
  \ head somehow travel down south\u2026)\n \nShe pulls it out like a fishing rope.\
  \ \n \nI\u2019m humiliated I\u2019ve let this nice lady touch my hairy sweaty body\
  \ but before I have time to think, I\u2019m rolled over in one swift movement and\
  \ she starts massaging my chest. \n \n \nWHAT\n \nIS\n \nGOING \n \nON\n \n\u201C\
  you kay\u201D\n \n\u201Cyes yes I\u2019m fine, fine, thanks\u201D  \n \nMy left\
  \ leg is suddenly thrust back for a stretch and the inevitable happens\n \nI fart.\n\
  \ \nI burst out laughing, breaking the aromatic tension. She joins in whilst holding\
  \ my leg like a pole and the two of us laugh together at the universal hilarity\
  \ of passing wind. \n \nIn the lift downstairs we\u2019ve resumed professionalism.\
  \ She asks if I\u2019ll write her a review on Trip Advisor as she hands me two trainers:\
  \ one glowing, one grubby.\n \n\u201Cfive stars, yes?\u201D."
