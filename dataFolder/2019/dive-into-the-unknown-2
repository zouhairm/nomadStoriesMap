Text: "November 26, 2018:\nAirport Gilberto Freire/Recife-PE, boarding time, ready-made\
  \ luggage, anxiety at its peak and joy spreading. It was a busy flight, it did not\
  \ stop raining, the delay was higher than we expected. Anyway, we arrived, 19 \xB0\
  \ C, Serra Ga\xFAcha - Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.\nThe orchids were blue and yellow\
  \ - their colors change according to the type of soil - it was love at first sight,\
  \ we arrived ready to venture, but what to expect when we immerse ourselves in the\
  \ unknown?\nThe junction of the mist with the orchids leaves the place looking like\
  \ a painting, a picture painted with all the care of the world, with the intention\
  \ of transmitting the real feeling of the place. Was it in some Netflix scene or\
  \ was it the joy of the place that was infecting me? Unlike the movies, there I\
  \ was writing my own script.\nI walked aimlessly along Avenue of Hydrangeas, the\
  \ city was really cozy, it seemed to have made every detail of the hand, the hours\
  \ were passing and the sun's rays were arriving and reflecting in the Valley of\
  \ the Quilombo - does it still have how to be more beautiful? - We found a waterfall\
  \ - yes, it was much more beautiful -.\nWe decided to have breakfast and venture\
  \ into the unknown. And it was in our breakfast that we realized that beauty was\
  \ not only in the landscape, but in each inhabitant, detail, everything belonged\
  \ magically to that place had no way to separate them.\nWe were greeted with a large\
  \ table, had breads, cakes, pastries, cheeses, juices, fruit and more, every detail\
  \ was thought with such care that everything became charming, the care was so much\
  \ that even the coffee overflowed just to contemplate the moment .\nAfter breakfast\
  \ we set off on the mission of being surprised. First stop: Train Maria Fuma\xE7\
  a, there were 4 hours of dancing, joy and knowledge. A place discovered by Italians\
  \ has become the place of wine, hydrangeas and why not love?\nWe continued traveling\
  \ being surprised at every step, the beauty seemed to have no end - and it did not\
  \ have -. We found the Magic Land of the Florybal, the connection with nature was\
  \ deep, we listened to the ants' walk, the place is fantastic, it gives to experience\
  \ from the Mesozoic era to the present day; to find the mine of the Seven Dwarfs\
  \ and Dracula's Cave, a true history lesson and children's tales.\nThe days passed,\
  \ we found a cooperative, The Colonist's House, it is about settlers of lawn where\
  \ they marketed breads, cucas, cookies, cheese, juices and much more, they are delicious,\
  \ the love to do what is liked was in each piece of the products.\nWe bought breads\
  \ filled with grape juice, sat in Communications Square, looked around, had people\
  \ of all kinds: hurrying, inattentive, dreamers, romantics but all had something\
  \ in common, they were enchanted by the landscape, the they did not want to miss\
  \ the next street under the sun's rays, the romantics chose a landscape and they\
  \ contemplated, the inattentive ones preferred to be surprised of what to look for\
  \ and to lose some detail of that wonderful place, the dreamers were thanking for\
  \ allowing themselves to realize their dreams. And at the end of the day, everyone\
  \ stopped and together they watched the lights show enchant to that place that we\
  \ thought we had, but no secret.\n\nI did not expect to find so much love, care\
  \ and happiness in one place, but I found more than good friends, I regained the\
  \ spirit of adventure in which I should never have left. Being afraid of the new\
  \ is normal, we do not know what he is waiting for, but to stop living by fear is\
  \ the biggest mistake we can make.\nLike the Serra Gaucha, the world is open to\
  \ visits and we do not need an authorization to become an adventurer, and we must\
  \ be authors of our own films. \nWhat will be the next wonder to venture? Only fate\
  \ can tell me, and you know what? I am happy because I know that there is always\
  \ a story to write in any place."
