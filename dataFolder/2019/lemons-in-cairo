Text: "On my first night in Cairo, my waiter taught me a magic trick. \n\nA slice\
  \ of lemon, a saucer filled with a little water, a match, and a glass. He presented\
  \ them to me with the solemn care of a surgeon laying out his scalpels. \n\nThe\
  \ object of the game was to get the water into the glass without touching the saucer.\
  \ He was young, handsome, and had gasped convincingly when told I wasn\u2019t old\
  \ enough for a cocktail. I was, of course, desperate to impress. \n\nI tried scooping\
  \ the water into the glass, using the lemon wedge as a sponge to soak up the water\
  \ (logic was not my strong point). \n\n\u2018I give up,\u2019 I said eventually,\
  \ irritated at myself for failing the test. \n\nHe grinned. \u2018You sure?\u2019\
  \ \n\nI nodded, watching warily as he gathered his materials for the big reveal.\
  \ Obviously, it was only possible to win by cheating. He\u2019d pick the dish up\
  \ with a napkin, or something, so he was never really touching it. It\u2019ll be\
  \ clever, and technically allowed, but most of all it would be a little disappointing.\
  \  \n\nExcept, it wasn\u2019t like that at all. \n\nHe lay the slice of lemon in\
  \ the centre of the dish of water. Lit the match and stuck the base of it carefully\
  \ into the lemon, so that it stood up straight. Placed the glass upside-down over\
  \ the whole contraption, in the centre of the saucer. \n\nThen I watched in fascination\
  \ as the water slowly began crawling away from the edges of the saucer and up the\
  \ inside of the glass.  \n\n\u2018You see,\u2019 the waiter said, bending down until\
  \ he was eye level with the glass. \u2018The match creates a vacuum, and the water\u2026\
  \u2019\n\nI nodded in disbelief. Science, not trickery. A magic trick, instead of\
  \ a con.  \n\nThat was Cairo, for me: at once simple and very, very complicated.\
  \ \n\nThat feeling followed me throughout our week in Cairo. I felt it every time\
  \ I looked out of my hotel window and saw the Great Pyramid of Giza what looked\
  \ like a hundred metres beyond the hotel walls. \n\nYou\u2019ll hear in any tourist\
  \ guide that the Pyramid is, against all logic and in stark contrast to every photo\
  \ you\u2019ve ever seen, smack bang in the middle of Cairo. This shouldn\u2019t\
  \ be that surprising; Cairo has grown up around its historical buildings in much\
  \ the same way that English cities grow up around Roman walls and medieval castles.\
  \ And, in the same way that the English are blas\xE9 about anything less than five\
  \ hundred years old, the Egyptians seem to pay little mind to the monument in their\
  \ midst. \n\nBut, as a history-obsessed fifteen-year-old, looking at it felt a little\
  \ like being smacked in the chest. The pyramid should seem fragile in its antiquity,\
  \ but it was really almost intimidating, a vigilant parent watching over the comparatively\
  \ toddler-size hotels and houses surrounding it. \n\nSimple and complicated. Just\
  \ as advertised, and entirely different. \n \nI felt it when, the next day, I turned\
  \ to watch the slow, sleepy ribbon of the Nile to our left, with a seemingly impassable\
  \ four-lane highway thundering past to our right. \n\nI felt it in the quiet clutter\
  \ of the Egyptian Museum and, much later, in the footage of display cases and artefacts\
  \ smashed and stolen in the wake of the revolution. It was there in the hotel waiter,\
  \ and the men who flogged knee-high neon socks from market stalls and swore quietly\
  \ at us when we shook our heads, and the lady who patiently directed us away from\
  \ the city\u2019s industrial district and back towards the souks we sought. \n\n\
  Perhaps Cairo is different now, in the wake of the revolution and the rebuilding.\
  \ But, for me, it will always be like water crawling slowly, magically up the inside\
  \ of a glass: simple and complicated. As expected, and completely surprising."
