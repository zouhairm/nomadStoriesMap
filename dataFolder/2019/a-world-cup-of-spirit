Text: "\u201CLisepa Na\u0161a domovino.\u201D Our beautiful homeland. \nThe third\
  \ goal had been scored. The dancing fans in the swaying Jela\u010Dic square roared\
  \ the national anthem in passionate unison. Beer was thrown up in the air and confetti\
  \ poured down. Waving limbs were waving flags amongst the tears, the laughter and\
  \ the triumph. \n\nIt was the 21st June. On my third stop interailing around Croatia,\
  \ I was in Zagreb for the World Cup match Croatia vs. Argentina. It was also the\
  \ ultimate night of Croatia\u2019s annual classical festival, hosting the famous\
  \ Zagreb Philharmonics. Natives and tourists alike were torn on which special event\
  \ to attend. It was around 5pm; we were sat in our hostel bar, sipping Karlova\u010D\
  ko to the music of the excited hum of the residents of the city. I was with my two\
  \ friends from university Elli and Charlotte, Ilia, a softly spoken Cameroonian\
  \ and Ana, a local Croatian. Immobilised for the moment, I watched a constant red\
  \ flow of people being pumped through the city, as adrenaline surged through its\
  \ veins. \n\nIn Jela\u010Dic square a single screen stood proudly awaiting the thousand\u2019\
  s of pairs of eyes that would soon be upon it for the world cup match. Lights were\
  \ already bouncing around the square beckoning football fans from their homes. King\
  \ Tomislav Square, the classical headquarters was already full of cross-legged fanatics,\
  \ sat in front of the stage anticipating the collision of sounds to fill the air.\
  \ After much deliberation we decided on going to the football match first, then\
  \ the concert. We were all dressed devotedly in blue or red and we joined the stream\
  \ of people to the square, with Ana hopelessly attempting to teach us the national\
  \ anthem on the way. It goes like this\u2026 actually I will leave that for another\
  \ time\u2026 \n\nWe arrived and were immediately consumed by the stomach of the\
  \ crowd. What was a concrete square just hours earlier, was now a swarming stadium.\
  \ The crowd was a rainbow of red, blue and white. Flags were glued to every arm;\
  \ every cheek smeared with paint, every inch of their bodies patriotic. People were\
  \ spilling from every door and balcony in the bordering buildings. The air, choked\
  \ on the crowd\u2019s relentless release of red flares, was blinded by the penetrating\
  \ strobe lights and deafened by the howl of the plastic horns. Every sense was overwhelmed\
  \ with culture and spirit. All I could see was blue and red as I surrendered myself\
  \ to the shaking hands of the city.  \n\nAfter each goal, we followed Ana\u2019\
  s lead and shouted the tune of the national anthem along with the orchestra of the\
  \ crowd. I hoped my British accent was not too incongruous to expose me. With ten\
  \ minutes to go, Croatia scored their third goal and Argentina was still on zero.\
  \ The people climaxed. A fire of patriotism was lit and it spread throughout the\
  \ city. The square was a carnival, each street a parade. My friends and I danced\
  \ in rhythm with the united city to their first win of the World Cup; there was\
  \ no way Argentina could come back from this. \n\nAs the crowd began to calm and\
  \ the celebrations dispersed into every edge of the city, the sweet noise of classical\
  \ music began to distinguish itself. We followed our ears leaving the chaos behind\
  \ to listen to the festival, but tonight the city was its own musical instrument.\
  \ We calmed our racing hearts whilst sitting on the grass in front of the stage,\
  \ listening to a violin solo, with a celebratory drink in hand. \n\nThe zeal for\
  \ music and football existed harmoniously, with us tourists attempting to experience\
  \ it all, infected with the city\u2019s passion. Coincidence is a beautiful thing\
  \ when on your final night travelling you get to immerse yourself into the epitome\
  \ of Croatian culture, with friends that I am still in touch with today. I have\
  \ never experienced energy quite like it since, and I do not think I ever will."
