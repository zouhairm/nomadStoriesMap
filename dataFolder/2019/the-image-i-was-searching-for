Text: "I was searching for an image. That was the theme of the last few weeks of my\
  \ travels trough South America. After high school, I knew I needed to get out of\
  \ my small northern Germany town and into the world. Traveling to South America\
  \ has been a dream of my childhood so I worked at a bakery for four months. I was\
  \ quite lost. High school hasn't only been fun. I grew up as a Kurdish - German\
  \ in an otherwise white town with a half brother whose father is from Ghana. I had\
  \ good times at school but my family was always the odd one out. It didn't matter\
  \ how hard I worked or how well I did in school, I felt it. Both my brother and\
  \ me fell into depression, though we didn't know that's what it was at the time.\
  \ After I finished school, all I knew was that I needed to deal with this feeling\
  \ of not belonging - to embrace it. I wanted to immerse myself in the unknown. So\
  \ I chose a place far away and left all by myself without knowing a word of Spanish.\
  \ \nIn many ways, the trip showed me all I needed to see. I met people from all\
  \ over the world, misfits searching for some sense of belonging. I shed old beliefs\
  \ ingrained in me from the small town. Traveling South America was a deep experience\
  \ that shook me to the core. It made me humble, it made me appreciate all that I\
  \ have. I found friendships that last to this day. All this I felt while I was there,\
  \ traveling Argentina, Bolivia, Peru. I knew I had to get a tattoo while I'm traveling,\
  \ I wanted to hold onto this powerful experience, to honor it. I started searching\
  \ for an image but nothing quite felt right. Then there were only two weeks left.\
  \ A Swedish friend and I decided to hike trough the Colca Canyon in Peru. It was\
  \ e a three day trip up and down the mountains, following trails, paths, climbing,\
  \ hiking. And it was one of the places where you were supposed to see Condors. I\
  \ haven't seen a single one during my travels and I was eager to go get a peek at\
  \ one. South America. has given me so much, I was sure it'd fulfill this last wish.\
  \ We hiked under the burning Peru sun, sharing everything we learned during our\
  \ trip. We slept in tents or in huts. We didn't drink enough water and got sunburnt,\
  \ we didn't care. I kept my eyes wide open. Not a single Condor showed up. On the\
  \ last day, we had to hike up for seven hours to get out of the Canyon. Dehydrated,\
  \ sweaty, dirty and exhausted we fought our way up the mountain. Hours passed, hungry\
  \ dogs followed us but we ourselves were starving. I felt sad I didn't get to a\
  \ single Condor. Finally, after seven hours in the heat, we made it. We stood on\
  \ top of the Canyon, leaning against one another and looked down onto the majestic\
  \ landscape. We saw all the trails we hiked in the last days. It was an incredible\
  \ feeling and I thought in that moment, I will remember this forever, standing at\
  \ this very top. I turned to my friend, I thanked him for sharing this experience.\
  \ I breathed. Then I told him; wouldn't it be amazing to see a Condor now? We laughed,\
  \ that would be crazy. A second passed. Then, high above me, I could see a shadow\
  \ blocking out the sun. We looked up at the same time. A huge Condor was flying\
  \ right above our heads. His wings spread wide, he circled around as. He let out\
  \ a shriek and it echoed trough the Canyon and back to us. A smile spread on my\
  \ face and I remember becoming very calm, watching this amazing animal coming out\
  \ to play. After a few circles, he flew off into the distance and I was overcome\
  \ with gratitude and a feeling of trust. I looked at my friend, he nodded his head.\
  \ We both knew, this was the image I was searching for all along."
