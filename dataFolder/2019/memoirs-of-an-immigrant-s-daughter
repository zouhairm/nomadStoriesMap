Text: "I often ask myself where home is? They say home is where the heart is. Well\
  \ my heart is in a lot of places in different continents of the world. Can this\
  \ be possible? \n\nI was born in Fiji Islands to Indian parents, my mum was born\
  \ in Fiji Islands but my dad had immigrated to Fiji Islands from India in his 20s.\
  \ My grandfather on my mum's side was a colonial man who owned a shoe business throughout\
  \ Fiji Islands. I had an amazing childhood growing up in the Pacific, a tropical\
  \ paradise. Then of course, we had to leave our little paradise behind. Military\
  \ coup broke out in Fiji Islands in 1987 which resulted in the overthrow of the\
  \ elected government, resulting in tensions between Indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians\
  \ ethnic groups. This lead to many Indians leaving Fiji Islands to foreign pastures\
  \ like Australia, New Zealand, Canada and United States of America. My parents decided\
  \ to immigrant to New Zealand to seek safety and provide tertiary education for\
  \ their children. \n\nThe year was 1992 just after my 15th birthday, I was told\
  \ that we were moving to New Zealand. I was excited but I only knew of New Zealand\
  \ from the photographs that my parents had taken on their travels. It looked cold\
  \ and different. I was going to be leaving my life behind in a tropical paradise\
  \ which had turned somewhat a place of fear now. It was unsafe and we had to find\
  \ somewhere else to live for a better future. I was old enough to understand and\
  \ this was a common theme amongst my friends and their families. \n\nMy sister and\
  \ I arrived in Auckland, New Zealand in February without our parents. We had been\
  \ sent to start school and were going to be staying with our cousin who had already\
  \ settled and started a new life in New Zealand. I remember been terrified going\
  \ through customs at the airport but all was well, we were welcomed with open arms.\
  \ \n\nFast forward to first day at school, I step into the classroom and immediately\
  \ the teacher sits me next to an Indigenous Fijian girl whose family happened to\
  \ have moved to New Zealand from Fiji after the coup just like us. This was an awkward\
  \ moment. We had just been kicked out of our birth country by these people and now\
  \ I had to make friends with them. She felt just as awkward as I did. Fortunately,\
  \ a kiwi girl took a liking to me and offered to show me around. From that day on,\
  \ we were inseparable. I have fond memories of my school days in Auckland and enjoying\
  \ the summer in New Zealand, walking back from school, going to the beach on weekends\
  \ having an ice cream while strolling along the beachfront. \n\nWinter was soon\
  \ approaching, we were told to purchase polar fleece and merino wool jumpers. My\
  \ parents were soon to arrive and we would move to a small town 3 hours south of\
  \ Auckland called Rotorua because this is where my god-parents lived and we would\
  \ have their support. We had to move yet again, this time to a place that was rural\
  \ and country like, with lots of indigenous Maori culture. It was a tourist hub\
  \ of New Zealand, and still is. There are thermal pools, mud pools and geysers and\
  \ sheep shearing and rainbow trouts and deer farms. \n\nWe settled in a nice area\
  \ of Rotorua, just across from the Whakarewarewa 'Redwood' Forest and Tarawera,\
  \ Blue and Green Lakes. I have fond memories of walking through the forest everyday\
  \ after school. Winter had arrived. I had to wear woollen tights with school uniform.\
  \ I had never worn tights in my life, it was unpleasant but it kept me warm. I remember\
  \ getting up in the morning, gazing at your cold breath through the air and walking\
  \ on black ice, it made a crunchy noise upon footsteps. \n\nThe change was inevitable\
  \ but we embraced the change..we had to adopt to a new life in a foreign land and\
  \ we felt welcomed. This was the start of my nomad journey.."
