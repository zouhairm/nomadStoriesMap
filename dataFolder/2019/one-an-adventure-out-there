Text: "For all my friends who asked for details of the trip, here is a summary of\
  \ everything I have experienced in this beautiful land called Argentina.\nSeveral\
  \ things are very different from our Brazuca culture but what surprised me most\
  \ was the warmth with which the Argentines welcomed me, I do not speak any Spanish\
  \ and believe I made friends, I met incredible places and I loved every bit of it,\
  \ not to mention I found the Spanish very charming, an easy language.\nDescribing\
  \ Argentina is a bohemian feeling, drama, being able to stay late on the street\
  \ and not be desperate, is to be able (even without money) to the many parks in\
  \ the city, is to enjoy, to be enchanted without thinking about the time in the\
  \ thousands of cafes that the cities have, is to be able to go to the bakery and\
  \ eat a simple empanada and stay looking at the Iguassu River, it is power, finally,\
  \ to understand their tango so practiced in everyday life. It is to go to the Chinese\
  \ market on the corner of your hotel-house and buy a Malbec for 30 pesos and buy\
  \ a cheap cheese. It is night out, and see children at two o'clock in the morning\
  \ awake with their parents in restaurants. Good I visited four cities one of them\
  \ was Puerto Esperanza which is in the Province of Missiones, a very small town\
  \ but that has its charms. The other one was Puerto Iguaz\xFA where I stayed more\
  \ days and who has several tourist points, where I lived close to the Argentines,\
  \ I passed through Buenos Aires but only passing. Another small and very rich city\
  \ was Wanda that owns a mining of precious stones."
