Text: "The trails of Byeonsanbando National Park were well marked and maintained.\
  \ At some points there were two, giving the option to walk on a manicured, easy\
  \ path, or a more rugged route, for the adventurous hiker. Eventually the trail\
  \ led to Jiksopokpo falls, which provided a peaceful place to rest. After that,\
  \ it became steeper and steeper. Without a map, I didn\u2019t know how long it would\
  \ take, but I continued up the mountain until I could see a beautiful vista laid\
  \ out before me. The mountain below spread out to a wide valley, that led down to\
  \ reaching sand flats, and finally  the ocean. I could see shining ribbons of water\
  \ streaming down to the sea, and in the distance, fishing boats, moored in place.\
  \ For this view alone, the hike would have been worth it, but there was something\
  \ even better waiting for me further on. \n\nA while later, beginning to worry about\
  \ the time of day and my return journey, I came to a fork in the trail. A sign pointed\
  \ to the left, leading to a higher peak. I\u2019d read about the fantastic views\
  \ and thrilling rope bridges leading there, and wanted to explore them, but I was\
  \ so tired, not having hiked long hours like this for a year or more. The other\
  \ sign, pointing down to the right, led to Naesosa Temple. I had no idea there was\
  \ a temple on this mountain, and I was curious to see it. I turned right. \n\nThe\
  \ descent down the mountain wasn\u2019t easy after hiking for so long. My mother\
  \ will kill me if I fall down a mountain and die alone in South Korea. I walked\
  \ carefully. I was fatigued and couldn\u2019t wait to get to the temple. Each rock\
  \ and tree root became an obstacle, and my ankles started to feel as fragile as\
  \ chicken bones. Suddenly all I could think about was having tea with a monk. I\
  \ didn\u2019t know if it was possible, but it became an obsessive thought, like\
  \ a mantra, that kept me going. If I can just get down this mountain and have tea\
  \ with a monk, everything will be ok. \n\nI made it to the temple grounds. The tiny\
  \ pebble and dirt walkways crunched underfoot. The only other sound was the tinkling\
  \ of water coming from the mouth of a stone turtle in the courtyard. Everything\
  \ was perfectly maintained, not a leaf out of place. There was no one around. I\
  \ stopped to read a bulletin board posted on one of the buildings about a templestay\
  \ program. As I read, footsteps approached behind me. Clunky black shoes, gray robes,\
  \ thick black-framed glasses, and a shining bald head with a warm smile met my eyes.\
  \ Here was the monk I had prayed for. And she was a woman! She introduced herself,\
  \ and asked me where I was from and what I was doing at the temple. I expressed\
  \ my interest in the templestay program I had just read about. She invited me for\
  \ tea. It felt like destiny.\n\nWe left our shoes outside the door, and entered\
  \ a room that was warm and enveloped in wood. Paper paneled windows let in the diffused\
  \ autumn light. Sunim gave me a floor cushion and I sat across from her at a low\
  \ table. She asked me questions about myself while she made tea, a process that\
  \ was mesmerizing to see. I watched her hands as she scooped the leaves, poured\
  \ the water, steeped the tea. She made everything with a practiced, studied air.\
  \ It was like a ceremony. We discussed politics, feminism, religion, life as an\
  \ American teacher in Korea and life as a Buddhist monk. She explained to me the\
  \ significance of the lotus flower in Buddhist ideology. I relaxed in her presence,\
  \ and we joked and laughed with the ease of old friends. I forgot my fear on the\
  \ mountain. She invited me to come back anytime. I could stay at the temple, learn\
  \ and practice with her. When I left, she taught me the proper way to bow to a monk,\
  \ and wished me well. I planned to return soon. I walked away, full to the brim."
