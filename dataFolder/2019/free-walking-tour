Text: "As I fastened the seatbelt in the bus that would take us to Cabo Polonio, all\
  \ I could think about was that if anyone had told me that this was how I would end\
  \ my day, I would have called them crazy at once.\n\nAt 10 in the morning, I was\
  \ relieved for successfully arriving at Independencia Square in time for the Free\
  \ Walking Tour that would present me Old Montevideo after having a too-long breakfast\
  \ that had set me back. Even still worried that the group would leave without me,\
  \ I couldn't help taking a few moments to admire the grandness of the place: the\
  \ quite wide area is home for tens of the tallest palm trees I had ever seen and\
  \ right in the center of the square a gigantic Jos\xE9 Artigas looks down upon the\
  \ passersby mounted on a fierce looking horse. \n\nAfter a couple of minutes I finally\
  \ crossed the Square to meet the people gathering around the man holding a cerulean\
  \ umbrella, our guide. Jorge presented himself and asked us to do the same, so that\
  \ we would feel less of a gaggle and more of a group. We were two couples of Argentinians,\
  \ three Colombians, a guy from Ecuador, a small French family and some Brazilians,\
  \ like me, but from Pernambuco state - quite far from home.\n\nJorge started the\
  \ tour by telling us about the Square itself, what necessarily went through learning\
  \ the main facts about Uruguain independence, which is quite bounded with the history\
  \ of their neighbor Argentina. While admiring the beautiful memorial that shelters\
  \ the remains of the independence hero Artigas, built in the underfloor of his statue,\
  \ I got lost in thoughts about how the Independence is such an important and pride-taking\
  \ topic in all of the three countries I had visited the last days - Chile, Argentina\
  \ and now Uruguay. Montevideo was my last stop before returning home in two days.\n\
  \nI was brought back from my reflections by one of the members of my group talking\
  \ to me. It was the Ecuatorian man, Enrique, making some small talk while we approached\
  \ the City Portal, that divides old and modern Montevideo. At first I tried to dispatch\
  \ the conversation quickly so that I could listen better to what Jorge had to tell\
  \ us about the beautiful greek-reminding building that I learned to be Teatro Sol\xED\
  s. However, as we continued our walk, Enrique proved to be a nice interlocutor,\
  \ both about what we were seeing in the tour and about social development, an interest\
  \ we shared in common. \n\nWe engaged in conversation so much that we stayed behind\
  \ a few times, talking and taking pictures. By the time we reached the profusion\
  \ of smells and colors that was Mercado del Puerto, Jorge had already used the word\
  \ \"pareja\" in a completely pointless joke. \n\nThe tour ended in a square next\
  \ to Taranco Palace, where nowadays works the Museum of Decorative Arts. Jorge granted\
  \ the group that besides the beautiful collection, it was particularly worth the\
  \ visit because of a painting of Goya on show. I didn't have a glimpse of doubt\
  \ that I wanted to see it, and was happy to find out that neither did Enrique. The\
  \ palace, built in a French architecture, was already a delight from the outside,\
  \ but the interior collection, composed by furniture, paintings and sculptures that\
  \ went back to the XVIII century was breathtaking. We must have spent about 10 minutes\
  \ admiring the 17-inch Goya picture, Episode of the French Invasion.\n\nWhen we\
  \ finally managed to unstick our eyes from the collection, we were pleased to notice\
  \ that the Palace had a charming interior garden. I asked Enrique if he wanted to\
  \ have lunch togheter, and got a little surprised by the serious and somewhat sad\
  \ look on his face. \"I can't, I'm going to Cabo Polonio in two hours and still\
  \ have to check out and go to the bus station\". I was about to break the silence\
  \ and say it was OK, when he came closer and continued \"I know it must sound crazy,\
  \ but would you come with me?\"\n\nI could barely believe myself when I heard my\
  \ own voice answering \"Yes\"."
