Text: "It is dark and I am walking through the streets of Busan on a beautiful November\
  \ evening. Busan has an amazing feeling to it and no matter where in the city I\
  \ am, I can always feel the essence of the ocean nearby. Yet, in contrast to the\
  \ calming atmosphere, I am sobbing; the kind of sobbing one would see from a girl\
  \ jilted by her prom date. After a thorough dumping of my backpack, my wallet is\
  \ nowhere to be found.\nI am here as a last hurrah of sorts before starting my first\
  \ full time job after college. One of my very best friends, Riley, is an English\
  \ teacher at a hagwon, and I wanted to experience Southeast Asia for a decent amount\
  \ of time before coming home. Yet, here I am, in an alley, calling my bank and praying\
  \ something can be done. I still have two weeks left of my trip before coming home.\n\
  Unsurprising to anyone with a lick of travel experience, the bank cannot help me\
  \ out. In my wallet was my debit card and I had failed to secure an emergency international\
  \ credit card before coming. If only I had taken my mother\u2019s advice! But alas,\
  \ clich\xE9d young adult overconfidence had taken away any foresight she attempted\
  \ to instill in me. Along with this, Riley, who I am staying with, recently confessed\
  \ to me that she had 0-won to her name due to paying off a student loan. We only\
  \ had 20,000-won, the equivalent of a little over $20, left in a side pocket of\
  \ my bag between the two of us for the coming two weeks.\nThe next five or six days,\
  \ we are sustained by eating convenience store dumplings, leftover food from the\
  \ neighbors, and free samples from the local grocery store. Our nights consist of\
  \ going on walks around the city for, not only the sights, but the free entertainment\
  \ a nice walk offers. With this frugality, we only spend 10,000-won and stay well\
  \ within our budget.\nOne evening, we are at Haeundae Beach, enjoying the beautiful\
  \ gratuitous view it offers when I hear Riley scream so loud, the spirit of my dear\
  \ departed great-grandmother can probably hear. She picks up a 10,000-won bill left\
  \ in the sand. I will never forget this moment. It is one of pure, euphoric, unrelenting\
  \ joy. We are crying and dancing.\nWe immediately go to a carnival game off of the\
  \ beach where Riley had been eyeing a stuffed bear. I have never understood the\
  \ idea of outgrowing stuffed animals. It is a guiltless source of joy. Many of my\
  \ peers had dumped theirs off of their bed long ago to be replaced with beige bedspreads;\
  \ the worst color! The amount of love and cuteness this specific bear offers makes\
  \ it a great investment, and we are willing to take the gamble.\nThe game is simple.\
  \ We have one chance to throw a dart at a balloon and pop it. I personally have\
  \ never been much of a darts connoisseur, but the situation calls for me to be impeccable.\
  \ I channel whatever dart gods may be and throw a Hail Mary toss. I hear a pop,\
  \ and once again, unbridled joy floods the two of us. We choose the biggest bear\
  \ we can.\nWe go to the nearest convenience store to purchase a beer to share with\
  \ what money is left over. We lay on the beach, sipping the beer, looking at our\
  \ newfound bear friend, and feeling grateful for little miracles."
