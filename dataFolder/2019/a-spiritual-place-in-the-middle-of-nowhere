Text: "Time ago i meet face to face with a great secret from the distant past. It\
  \ was april of 2004, i already have been in Santa Cruz, in the far bolivian north\
  \ for less more than three weeks, originally i travel there to stay only four days\
  \ to work as the keynote speaker in a crypto-jewish encounter, i haved discovered\
  \ my jewish roots four years before and i was invited to tell my story to arround\
  \ four hundred people. After the last day of meetings, they invite me to stay and\
  \ speak in some local communities, i spend a great time knowing beautiful places\
  \ and eating really weird food (to me at least), even i earn two or three pounds,\
  \ during one of the meals the community leader Yoshua says to me that they want\
  \ to take me to see a really special place, i ask where is it, he says \u201Ci cannot\
  \ put it in words, when we get there you will know, you will see, have a little\
  \ patience\u201D, next act i was sitted in a car in the middle of a nowhere road\
  \ going to this little town called something like \u201CValverde\u201D both side\
  \ of the road i can see tall green mountains with trees all arround that looks a\
  \ hard but print a beautiful contrast with the turquese sky as canvas. Suddenly\
  \ i started to notice that we are taking a side road, a dusty one really old with\
  \ no road signals in it, no electric cables, like a lost field road.\nAfter arround\
  \ fourty minutes of dust and more dust, we stop, Yoshua and the driver David breath\
  \ in really deep, i felt their emotional energy, i my self get a little emotional,\
  \ i didn\u2019t know why (yet) we left the car and start to walk trough the dust\
  \ in the air, as we advance i started to see a really big gray mountain in front\
  \ of us, they walk fast towards it with flash lights in their hands, i started to\
  \ feel a little anxiety, still didn\u2019t know why, but i keep walking until we\
  \ get there, in the low part of the mountain covered with the long branches of grass\
  \ there was this little cave, a secret entrance to the mountain, i started to think\
  \ that this look like a fantasy. Then Yoshua tells me, \u201Cdear brother, we need\
  \ to enter very carefully, this i s a gift from us, from our heart to yours\u201D\
  .\nIt was really dark, we walk arround ten minutes, i can\xB4t see much of the cave,\
  \ then he says to me, this time in a more serious tone \u201Carround five hundred\
  \ years ago, or ancesters escape from Spain leavig behind the inquisition and came\
  \ here to America and try to start a new life, but the inquisition chases them,\
  \ and came to Per\xFA, and the voice of it was heard all over Bolivia too, the families\
  \ that stay here in Valverde pose in front of the spanish people as normal catholic\
  \ families, but\u2026\u201D he stops. then turn on a big kerosene lamp that David\
  \ take from he back pack. As it start to iluminate the cave, Yoshua speak again:\
  \ \u201Cbut they keep our tradition, our religion, our way of life, here, in this\
  \ old natural rocky synagogue\u201D i don\u2019t understand inmediately what he\
  \ was saying, until thanks to the light i see clearly a stone table in the cave\
  \ center, another many stones arround it ordered as a temple, and hebrew letters\
  \ carved and painted in the rock walls. I could not believe it, my heart started\
  \ to pound faster, the tears flow from my eyes, i was standing in a place where\
  \ peope like me, like us, pray, study, share and keep their faith and their flame\
  \ alive, i felt a great amount of spiritual energy, i almost could felt the presence\
  \ of their souls, almost hear the mel\xF3dic hebrew chants, we stay in silence,\
  \ i cry in silence for a while, i say a little prayer and kee the silence until\
  \ we came back. I will never forget it, and always tell this story, about the oldest\
  \ synagogue of Bolivia, that almost anyone knows."
