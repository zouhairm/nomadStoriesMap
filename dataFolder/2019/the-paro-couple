Text: "We finally found a cab that would take us to Paro(Bhutan) from Phuntsholing\
  \ , border town of Bhutan with India. My friend and I were excited to begin our\
  \ drive and were discussing our plans to stop the car on the way to click pictures.\
  \ Just then our reverie was broken by Penpa, our driver who asked whether we would\
  \ be okay to share the ride with a couple. We were short on cash and had already\
  \ lost an opportunity to visit Thimpu due to a National Holiday in Bhutan. With\
  \ our cramped schedule , we wanted no delays. We said yes and in a few minutes we\
  \ were joined by a couple who introduced themselves as Dawa (wife) and Migmar(husband)\
  \ . They were Bhutanese and lived in Paro . I sat in the front and my friend took\
  \ the right-side window seat in the back. The topography changed almost immediately\
  \ as we started our steep uphill drive. \nThere were cleaner roads and green mountains\
  \ surrounding us. Looking at our amazement, Dawa said that these roads were maintained\
  \ by the Indian army for their excursions. With a sudden urge to know more about\
  \ Bhutan and its people, I asked Migmar what did their name mean in Bhutanese language.\
  \ He explained that the country has a tradition of giving the newborn child the\
  \ name of the day they were born on. Hence , Migmar meant Tuesday and Dawa meant\
  \ Monday as they were born on the respective days. Penpa , who till now was pensive\
  \ , chuckled a bit and said that his name means Saturday. We asked them the Bhutanese\
  \ way of greeting and learnt a bit of local dialect. This was something I was really\
  \ aware about from earlier travels to other countries that I should at least know\
  \ how to communicate my name and other little details to the locals.\nMigmar pointed\
  \ out to a small fruit seller at the side of the highway. We stopped and purchased\
  \ bananas , but Migmar did not let us pay and shone a bright smile at us . In the\
  \ car he said that we have a twin pair of bananas in the bunch which meant the bachelors\
  \ would soon find a bride .  My dear friend who was till now half dozing, heard\
  \ it and inquired about the myth and very gleefully agreed that it might be true.\
  \ It was only much later back in India that I would get to know that he had just\
  \ started dating a girl. The couple had brought a small cake packet with them and\
  \ shared it with us and we in turn shared our \u2018khakaras\u2019. The 4-5 hour\
  \ journey to Paro was laden with many monasteries, some small others bigger. We\
  \ clicked pictures of wherever we could. It might have prolonged the journey time\
  \ for the Paro couple a wee bit more but they were incredibly nice and even suggested\
  \ great spots to take snaps.\nAs we took a left turn from the Thimpu Highway towards\
  \ Paro, the sun was setting and the Paro river running along the side of the road\
  \ was gleaming with last bit of sunlight streaming over the mountains. As we entered\
  \ the beautiful and a very peaceful town of Paro, we were asked by our new friends\
  \ to have dinner with them . We were overwhelmed and agreed to their wish. \nAfter\
  \ a shower and a small walk along the Paro river beside our lodge , we were picked\
  \ up by Dawa and Migmar in their small truck. They first drove us around town which\
  \ was so small , that we were done in half an hour and then took us to a Karaoke\
  \ bar in the city. Dawa\u2019s singing was a revelation to us and Migmar told us\
  \ that she was a professional singer. After dinner, they dropped us back and we\
  \ promised to meet them the next evening after our hike from the Tiger\u2019s nest.\
  \ Our first day in Paro had been so short yet so eventful . Little tipsy from the\
  \ wine in our bellies, we drifted to deep sleep , gladdened about a day well spent\
  \ with lovely people!"
