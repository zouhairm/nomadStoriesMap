Text: To be honest, I have never travelled abroad as of yet but I did travel to parts
  of India visited less by the population. To escape from college, mounting works
  and pressure, I decided to book a ticket at random and travel all by myself. I took
  on a different name and I interacted with people from that area. I never felt so
  relaxed. The times I spent with the people I know and the time that I spent in Himachal
  Pradesh, the only difference was that I could be myself. Everything was new for
  the people of the hills, the things that I have to offer, nothing same old. I made
  a few friends over there, two little boys, a shopkeeper and lots of dogs! I went
  around exploring the hills alone, stopped on distant stalls for tea to warm myself
  up. I wrote a few good poems when I was there. I hmcould breathe without having
  to worry about much. My stay lasted for a week and I hopped around hotels and places
  and had the chance of meeting amazing people in the process of doing so. The small
  wildflowers, the clouded mountain terrains, the night sky, full of stars that are
  no longer visible from a city point of view, the smell of fresh grass and air, tingling
  your nose and leaving just enough to make you feel at home with yourself. It was
  all a beautiful experience.
