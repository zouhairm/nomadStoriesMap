Text: "Swallowed and tormented by existential angst and grappling constantly with\
  \ the meaning of life, I decided a year ago to head somewhere away from home in\
  \ the hope of finding myself again, in the hope of invigorating and rising myself\
  \ from the ashes. I had nothing but a glimmer of hope. Hope, which for an absurdist\
  \ pessimist was nothing but an illusion. Nevertheless, I gave myself a chance and\
  \ took a shot in the dark. After all, I was not living.\n\nAt first, I couldn't\
  \ pick up a place to go for many reasons. To begin with, I was tired of the hectic\
  \ lifestyle of the major cities and their dull routine. Moreover, the idea of isolating\
  \ myself in the wilds at that particular time when I was down in the dumps was not\
  \ tempting nor was it the right decision to take. In fact, what I really needed\
  \ was a unique place that combines the two forms of life, where what is urban and\
  \ what is rural meet in harmony to give birth to a world so whimsical, so consolatory\
  \ and peaceful. All I had to do to find such a place was asking around. One day,\
  \ a German traveler pulled over his van to take a break. I stroke up the conversation\
  \ with him, told him my story, posed the question and got the answer: ESSAOUIRA.\
  \ \n\nI still remember the day I arrived at Essaouira. It was an early Monday morning.\
  \ Patches of dense fog were all over the place. Birds chirping and busily lifting\
  \ from branch to brach as if each one was conducting an orchestra. The breeze of\
  \ the morning. The long and wide sandy beach. The old Portuguese ramparts. Everything\
  \ was just perfect, yet I still had that subdued voice telling me what is the point\
  \ of all this ? Is it really worthwhile? If, there is something worthwhile in this\
  \ life in the first place. But wait a minute! I had already been mesmerized by the\
  \ place the moment I got there. I just didn't allow my mind to accept and conceive\
  \ that plain fact.\n\nI was extremely lucky that my trip was timed to coincide with\
  \ one of Morocco\u2019s largest musical events, The Gnaoua\_World Music\_Festival.\
  \ It attracts musicians and bands annually from all over the world. The hypnotic\
  \ sounds of Gnaoua music reverberated within my soul and filled me with extraordinary\
  \ passion. The music touched my heart strings and lifted my spirits. Its rhythms\
  \ are so spiritual and so captivating.\n\nIn the afternoons, I went wandering around\
  \ the bright yet narrow alleys of the spice and jewellery souqs. The streets were\
  \ full of colourful blankets and rugs, wooden handicrafts, and delicious food. Just\
  \ the mere act of seeing all of this was good enough for me because sometimes we\
  \ buy or take pictures of stuff but we forget to enjoy the present moment, the moment\
  \ of being surrounded by beauty itself.\n\nHaving tea on the shaded promenade was\
  \ something totally uplifting. There, I had the chance to meet people from all tribes,\
  \ people from towns I have never heard of, people of different beliefs and worldviews.\
  \ Those conversations, short as they may seem, helped me a great deal in how I think\
  \ of my fellow human beings.\n\nI meandered down to the harbour one of the early\
  \ mornings to see the fishermen returning with the catch which all of a sudden reminded\
  \ me of a quote from The Old Man And The Sea \"A man can be destroyed but not defeated.\"\
  \ At that very moment, I realized that I was not defeated but destroyed. Destroyed\
  \ by myself for not traveling to explore the aesthetic dimensions of life, for not\
  \ opening my eyes enough to see that there is a meaning and it's available for everyone.\n\
  \nPeople sometimes ask me where is the adventure in all of this? and I simply reply\
  \ that advanture is not confined to risk and danger. Often times it can be a turning\
  \ point in our life. It can be going from death to a vibrant and purposeful life\
  \ and that's what travelling is all about. Travelling has led me to find what I\
  \ did not expect."
