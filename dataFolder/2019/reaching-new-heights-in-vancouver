Text: "A day after my arrival in Vancouver, who'd have guessed I'd be making connections\
  \ that I hope to keep for a lifetime. A chain reaction of events spurred by an impromptu\
  \ joining of the Facebook group 'Women Who Explore - Vancouver' in the weeks leading\
  \ up to my departure. \n\nIt may have been a 16 hour flight that saw me leave Australia\
  \ on one day and arrive in Vancouver the morning of that same day but I wasn't going\
  \ to let that stop me getting the ball rolling in exploring this beautiful city\
  \ and its' surrounds. The very next morning I took up with two strangers one of\
  \ whom will forever be a dear friend to me now, to navigate our way in an unknown\
  \ city and explore. Picture a short easy hike through forest, rivers roaring with\
  \ summer snow melt, a quiet lake, surrounded by trees and in the distance a snow\
  \ capped mountain all a short bus ride from the city. I had arrived and it took\
  \ my breath away. \n\nA few days later I was on my next adventure. 20 something\
  \ women, some strangers, some friends,  corralled themselves into array of rideshares\
  \ to meet and hike St Marks summit. What is that saying? 'It's the journey not the\
  \ destination'. Well, a few wrong turns meant that destination changed but still\
  \ here I was, an Aussie, hiking in the snow, in the sunshine, it was glorious! As\
  \ women are want to do we all chatted as we walked, to discover that we were from\
  \ all parts of the globe and revelled in the joy and the freedom of hiking. A few\
  \ more wrong turns and some helpful directions from kind Canadian folk, we found\
  \ our destination. A rocky outcrop overlooking downtown Van and in the distance\
  \ a formidable snow capped peak so large it actually resides in the US. Here I had\
  \ my first cheeky experience with Canadian wildlife, as chipmunks scurried across\
  \ to steal whatever nuts and goodies we may be snacking on before our descent down\
  \ the mountain. \n\nFrom this experience I formed a network of women who showed\
  \ me the charm of Vancouver, it's city lifestyle and the ease of access to awe inspiring\
  \ environments. Once I felt comfortable, I signed myself up for Evo, a rideshare\
  \ that works! I explored near and far. Goldern Ears National Park is a little further\
  \ a field of Vancouver city but a must see. I hiked a loop track that took me to\
  \ Half Moon Bay, and climbed back up the mountain to look back on scenery akin to\
  \ something out of Lord of the Rings. As the young group of guys that followed summed\
  \ up perfectly 'woah'.Next it was my turn to lead the exploration, I drove with\
  \ four women the 2.5 hours from Vancouver to Joffree's Lake. A hike that offers\
  \ up not one but two turquoise blue opaque mountain lakes, the top most one backed\
  \ by a glacier. \n\nNow this may all sound like I am an experienced hiker but to\
  \ be honest these were some of my first real hikes. I was just bolstered by the\
  \ community of women that I met. These connections allowed me to experience an authentic\
  \ lifestyle in Vancouver. I day tripped to a number of the city parks, I lazed by\
  \ lakes with snack purchased at local farmers markets, I went kayaking, I spent\
  \ afternoons chatting with a diverse array of women on the banks of the Vancouver\
  \ 'beaches' (sorry guys I'm from Australia, Canadian beaches aint got nothing on\
  \ us). I even went on my first real camping trip! I was empowered by the experience\
  \ of doing this with women of all ages and from all walks of life coming together\
  \ to share our passion and joy for the grat out doors. I learnt so may tips and\
  \ tricks for being out in the wilderness and now that I am home I continue to explore.\
  \ \n\nThis trip was life changing and will forever be imbued in the way I choose\
  \ to travel and explore in the future. Driven to make local and like minded connections\
  \ that allow me to have an authentic experience and make lifelong friends."
