Text: All I truly remember is the man grabbing my hands, us counting to ten and letting
  out a sigh of relief. This was familiar to me as it was something my grandfather
  continuously practiced on all of the grandchildren. He would say, "this is going
  to clear your head because right now you need the extra space".  It had been twelve
  years since his passing and here I am with a complete stranger reciprocating the
  exact method. This random act of true kindness all rooted from my cell phone slipping
  out of my pocket on to the seat of the bus. He was an older white Irishman whom
  looked passed my brown skin seeing only a young lady in need of assistance. Having
  being raised in Norfolk, Virginia for most of my entire life I was not accustomed
  to someone being so generous and welling to help. I felt terrible, embarrassed and
  childlike all at once. It was really my first time traveling abroad alone and I
  was failing miserably at it. Thankfully, my kind stranger managed to make several
  phone calls and tracked down the bus I had been on. Sitting upfront in a green and
  white taxi I watched us zip thru the narrow roads of Dublin to its city center.  We
  drove around the center twice then pulled up to the stop that was scheduled on the
  buses next route. He flagged down the bus driver as we approached the stop. The
  driver smiled recognizing my blue coat that resembled the one paddington bear wears.
  Her and my new friend had a chuckle at my expense over my reaction when she then
  passed me the cell phone. Walking back to the taxi-cab all my senses had returned
  to my body and I could not thank the man enough. His name was Joesph, just like
  my grandfathers.
