Text: "Ducks quacking, vintage steel chairs reflected on a small lake, and whispers\
  \ of soft winds on vineyards and olive trees welcome visitors at Karnas Ba\u011F\
  lar\u0131 boutique winery in Bodrum, Turkey. \n\nOnce at the winery, visitors are\
  \ greeted and welcomed with a heartwarming couple; Silva and Haluk.\n\nThe two have\
  \ been married for more than 40 years. They smile at visitors and tell them how\
  \ the idea of establishing a winery came to them after retiring from their engineering\
  \ post.\n\n\u201CWe are mainly known by the Zinfandel wines, which are also known\
  \ as Primitivo,\u201D Silva said.\nZinfadel includes a variety of black-skinned\
  \ wine grape.\n\nIt takes 20 minutes to get to the vineyard from Bodrum Airport.\
  \ The distance is rather short, and the vineyard is a must see.\nAfter being greeted\
  \ by cheerful ducks and swans, the couple invites visitors inside the freezing winery.\n\
  \n\u201CVisitors in the summer love it because the temperature is refreshing inside,\u201D\
  \ Silva said.\n\nHaluk, however, who travels for cheese tasting and discovering\
  \ new wine producing techniques, said that they make all types of wine; in that\
  \ region, however, red wine is more appreciated.\n\n\u201CIn the united states,\
  \ red wine is now considered a food and not a beverage,\u201D he said, adding that\
  \ \u201Cit is the healthiest drink between all alcoholic beverages.\u201D\n\nFurthermore,\
  \ not only is the sight of the visitors pleased with the inviting aesthetic of the\
  \ winery but so is their hearing, with the classical music that almost tenderly\
  \ beckons them to enter.\n\nApart from aesthetic purposes, the music also has a\
  \ practical function.\n\n\u201CThis type of music drives away yeast which is bad\
  \ for the wine,\u201D Silva mentions, adding that \u201Cany musical vibration could\
  \ help in driving away yeast.\u201D\nAfter completing the enriching tour inside\
  \ the winery, the time came for some wine tasting and food pairing in the garden\
  \ that hugs the vicinity of the winery.\n\nThe flowers reflect on the gleaming lake,\
  \ adding to the scenery an almost ethereal touch.\n\nDespite the distracting beauty\
  \ that makes the visitors forget their purpose of being there, Silva reminds them\
  \ and begins an unforgettable wine tasting journey.\n\nPicking a role creates a\
  \ successful team, and Silva and Haluk are here to prove it. She is the wine expert,\
  \ while he is the olive expert.\n\nHaluk made sure to step in before the wine tasting\
  \ and suggested that the visitors start with oil tasting before the wine.\n\nThe\
  \ secret of good olive oil is the ticklish feeling it leaves in the throat, several\
  \ minutes after tasting it, as the experienced man indicated.\n\nThe wine tasting\
  \ journey began right after that with KARNAS Shiraz, which is somehow fruity, and\
  \ suitable for aging. It bears the taste of black plums, blackberries, and violets.\n\
  \nAfter that, it was time for Karnas Shiraz 2015, which was paired with freshly\
  \ made bread with some olive oil. To top it, one can add goat cheese, mandarin,\
  \ and figs jam.\nHowever, the type of wine which the couple is most proud of is\
  \ KARNAS Zinfandel, which has some aromatic herbs, rosemary, and thyme notes.\n\n\
  The couple said that Turkey was the first to witness Zinfandel vineyards, and they\
  \ have received several prizes from many places in the world for that type of wine\
  \ they produce.\n\n\u201COur wines do not give you a headache the next day, as most\
  \ wines these days do,\u201D Haluk said, adding that \u201Clow sulfur leaves one\
  \ relaxed after drinking wine.\u201D\n\nHaluk and Silva insist on sharing with visitors\
  \ only what grows in their vineyards. \u201CSo today you find fig and mandarin jam,\
  \ and the next week you might find something else freshly made from our gardens,\u201D\
  \ they said.\nThe couple is also very proud of their olive oil, which is obtained\
  \ with 0.01 acid ratio. The olives are harvested early in the garden and are transformed\
  \ into olive oil instantly.\n\nEvents happening at the vineyard and winery include\
  \ weddings and other celebrations. The couple also welcomes visitors for wine-matching\
  \ events created with natural products.\n\nAt Zinfandel vineyards, excellent food\
  \ and wine are guaranteed to be on the table along with the magnificent view all\
  \ around.\n\nAs they spoke, the sun was setting, announcing the end of this unforgettable\
  \ trip."
