Text: "\u201CIt would be worth the trek.\u201D Our tour guide Emman assured us. On\
  \ a scorching heat of summer, I looked across the faces of my coworkers \u2013 the\
  \ twitched eyebrows, the smirked lips \u2013 indicated that they\u2019re not prepared\
  \ for this. Their whole life spent on the city, but not me.\nIn front of us, was\
  \ a trailless valley with pointed rocks everywhere and little cow grasses. I can\
  \ do this, I told myself, despite my wearing swimsuits and slippers only.\nI was\
  \ wrong. The Ditumabo Falls or \u201CMother\u201D Falls as the locals called it,\
  \ is a 45 min trek, as Emman told us. But it felt like a lifetime- a series of walking\
  \ towards slippery rocks, basking sun, dripping sweat, regret, and resignation.\
  \ Added to this were the makeshift bridges made out of bamboo and lumber that required\
  \ you to hold someone in order for you to cross the three small rivers.\nWe saw\
  \ the Sierra Madre Mountain from a distance. We learned that this place \u2013 Barangay\
  \ San Luis \u2013 was one of the site camps for Filipino soldiers during the Japanese\
  \ occupation. Anyone would want to hide here. We are surrounded by tall \u201Ctalahib\u201D\
  \ grasses that needed to be trimmed, and as we looked up, the canopies of tall coconut\
  \ trees. \nAfter the episodes of our heavy breaths and red-hot faces, we heard the\
  \ sound of the falls. We have arrived at our destination. Towering at approximately\
  \ 140 ft. is the Mother Falls. It was the most enchanting falls I\u2019ve ever seen.\n\
  My 10 yr. old self would have jumped right into it, but this time, I paused \u2013\
  \ as if the falls slapped me on the face with its beauty. The water slushed down\
  \ on the 30 - meter surface that made you felt embarrassed if you had decided to\
  \ quit at the beginning of the journey. The falls just recently opened to the public\
  \ a year ago, and they only allowed a limited number of visitors. We made the best\
  \ time of our lives by swimming to the clear cold water that the falls provided.\n\
  As we walked back, Emman told us that years from now, this place will be opened\
  \ for commercialization.\n\u201CIt\u2019s good, but I\u2019m worried about the incoming\
  \ pollution.\u201D He said this with a glimpse of tears on his eyes. Or maybe sweat?\
  \ I\u2019m not sure. \nThe dismayed tone of his voice and his concerned face made\
  \ me realized that this was much more troubling than the look on the faces of my\
  \ coworkers earlier.\nAlthough it never happened in the past, but it\u2019s as if\
  \ we\u2019re transported back to the Japanese era, and Emman informed us that one\
  \ of us had betrayed us, and told the Japanese soldiers where we\u2019re hiding.\n\
  \u201CBut for now it was worth the trek, right?\u201D Emman asked.\nTo which I replied,\
  \ \u201CYes, it was.\u201D"
