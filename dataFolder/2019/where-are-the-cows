Text: "A friends' meeting. This time in Scotland. A good vibe. Months of planning\
  \ out to visit this unfamous place. Four days. Loads to discover.\nScotland has\
  \ an underestimated weather. My friend thought it'll be the whole time raining.\
  \ \nI leave Bath (SW England) about to snow and I land in Inverness with the sun\
  \ blinding my eyes.\nOur main goal: Aurora Borealis.\nOther goals: Highland cow;\
  \ vikings with kilts; bagpipes; to visit Tomatin (in spanish \u201Csmall tomato\u201D\
  ).\nExpectations: Loads of snow; loads of whisky; best-seller soft drink IRN BRU\
  \ everywhere; sunset at 3 p.m.\nOvernight route: Thurso, Lossiemouth, Inverness\
  \ \nThe truth:\nArrived safe and sound to Thurso. We learn about black ice concept\
  \ afterwards.\nHostel room: Two bunk beds, flimsy if you sleep on the top.\nDunnet\
  \ Bay: Amazed eyes. Sheeps on the field. A virgin beach full up of black rocks all\
  \ over the border. Behind, the sea. \nDunnet Head: Sheeps on the field. Cliffs by\
  \ the sea. Agressive snow. Freezing wind. Immovable lighthouse. Unbelievable landscape.\
  \ Sheeps avoiding the cliff and the fence to be the models of our pictures. Surrealistic.\n\
  John O'Groats: Tourist's spot. Anyway, beautiful too.\nSunset arrived at 5 p.m..\
  \ \nWe continue our way driving through the snow, that becomes, by patches, a serious\
  \ deal. As a novice driver in the snow, I see the danger. My friend records videos\
  \ and dance with our special music. My other friend wants to visit a castle, somewhere\
  \ close, in the dark. Seeing there is more and more snow, I don't want to stop.\
  \ I don't want to get stuck in the snow. But suddenly, everything changes and the\
  \ snow dissappear. We stop by the castle.\nWe have dinner at Inverness and our drive\
  \ continue to Lossiemouth. \nHotel room: Amazingly huge. Cloudy night. No Aurora\
  \ expectations. Recommended bar: The Steamboat. We dismiss the option.\nWe wake\
  \ up to a freezing morning, but behind the windows seems a summer day. Sunny and\
  \ clear sky. I have my first full scottish breakfast. New routine: breakfast and\
  \ dinner.\nLossiemouth beach: Sunny. No clouds whatsoever. No snow yet. We make\
  \ some fool pictures in our ski clothes. \nNairn: The port has the water partially\
  \ frozen. We leave the car and walk. Tall grass in front of us. Behind, another\
  \ surprise. My eyes cannot yet believe it. A virgin beach. Flat, fine sand, quiet\
  \ waves, seagulls, small lighthouse. Clear blue sky and sunny. The perfection. One\
  \ downside:  It's cold. More cool and fool pictures.\nElgin's Cathedral: Cathedral\
  \ in ruins. Some snow. Solo route when we spread. I become a photographer.\nFort\
  \ George: Already closed. Walled castle. Sunset.\nClava Cairns: Compilation of stones\
  \ by Culloden aqueduct, very famous due to a serie my friend watches. Fool pictures.\n\
  We head to Inverness. \nHostel room: Fair enough\nChinese take-away food and we\
  \ head to Culloden Battlefield. Tonight is  the night. Too much light pollution.\
  \ We leave to Nairn. Port completely frozen. Light pollution. We drive to the other\
  \ side. Campervans' camping. We drive through. Rabbits and more rabbits. Light pollution.\
  \ Next stop is Findhorn. Seafront. Nobody. We decide to have dinner. Spicy chinese\
  \ food we don't expect to be spicy, almost kill us. No sighting. We drive to our\
  \ last spot: Lossiemouth. Dead. All hopes are lost. We look for a bar. We find it\
  \ at 12.40 a.m. The name: The Steamboat! Superparty! They close at 1 a.m.\nBack\
  \ to Inverness. Sleep.\nNext morning:\nUrquhart Castle: Ruined castle by Loch Ness.\
  \ No monster seen. Some fool or romantic pictures. \nFort Augustus: Not a castle.\
  \ Snow everywhere. A lot. We drive through an unexplored road. Tall trees. Some\
  \ houses. Blue hour. More snow. \nBack to Inverness.\nHotel room: Huge. \nWe have\
  \ dinner. Haggis and beef steak. Out it rains. We find a pub. Whisky shots. Countrymen.\
  \ Dancing. Laughter. We close the bar at 3 a.m. It rains. My friend expects us to\
  \ wake up at 7'30 a.m. to visit an old bookshop in town. I refuse to go, so they'll\
  \ go.\nNext and last morning: Breakfast. Split ways. Back to the room, I pack and\
  \ lie dead in the bed. \nWe leave.\nConclusions: No goals achieved. Constant and\
  \ intense surprises the whole trip. Wildness. Craziness. Happiness. I fancy."
