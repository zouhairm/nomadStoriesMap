Text: "Have you ever felt a peacefully beautiful sense of belonging in a place you\
  \ have never been before? It's when you feel most at peace with nature, the world,\
  \ yourself... I think this is the main reason I travel for, adventure is the only\
  \ thing that give me a sense of purpose in this big, crazy world. I travel for the\
  \ stories kind strangers share and for the places I haven't been yet, but most of\
  \ all, to discover as much as I can from this wonderful place we get to call home,\
  \ earth. \n\nNot so long ago, in the spring of 2017, I picked a small room for my\
  \ weekend stay in Sofia; I was an exchange student in Spain and I had just decided\
  \ I wanted to see every corner of this world; so I packed a little bag, bought the\
  \ cheapest ticket I could find for the weekend and 3 days later, landed in the freezing\
  \ land of Bulgaria. It was over past midnight when I rang the bell of a cozy flat\
  \ just in front of the Alexander Nevski Cathedral, which was the main reason I had\
  \ picked this apartment in the first place; but seeing it through photographs was\
  \ nothing compared as seeing it in realness; there I was standing in front of this\
  \ huge, majestic place, that looked so impotent just being beautifully hugged by\
  \ snow; I took a mental picture and thanked for this moment, I felt weirdly excited\
  \ about this trip and stayed still until the door opened and an old woman greet\
  \ me from the inside of what would be my home for the next two days, I enter in\
  \ a hurry since I hadn't been able to feel my feet for the last five minutes and\
  \ realized the lady had pijamas on, she smiled and with a broken English showed\
  \ me my room. That night I slept in the coziest, greenest room I had ever been in.\n\
  \nI spend all Saturday morning being a tourist, falling in love with the city, seeing\
  \ and exploring as much as I could for as long as I could hold up, after all, we\
  \ were in the land of the cold; I had never seen so many snow in a city or walked\
  \ so far without feeling my body. I returned to the apartment at around six o'clock,\
  \ with a cold nose and an empty stomach, but most of all, with a warm heart; the\
  \ old lady was in the kitchen, she saw me and instantly offered me a homemade soup,\
  \ so I could warm up; she must have thought I hadn't eaten in the longest time because\
  \ I devoured it in over a minute; and as she saw me defrosting little by little,\
  \ she started talking about her city, her beliefs, her life...  she told me about\
  \ when they lived in war, how the poverty struck and how she felt about her country\
  \ now, she remembered her mom and told me how she was able to get out, she told\
  \ me how when she came back, she brought presents that had to be hidden out in a\
  \ little spot behind the counter and the fear they used to live in every night...\
  \ we talked for over two hours, I mostly just heard, nod and asked, at the end,\
  \ I just stood there astonished, I was sharing a flat with the most interesting\
  \ person I have ever met, she was full of amazing, heartbreaking stories. We talked\
  \ again that night and over breakfast before I had to leave, we said goodbye as\
  \ two old friends; she wished me a happy returning and I wished her a safe staying.\
  \ I don't think I will see her again, at least in this life, but I learned so much\
  \ from her in so little time. \n\nTraveling has given me a lot of firsts, but nothing\
  \ can compare to the first local friend I ever made; meeting new people and hearing\
  \ them, learning from them and above all, making a real life connection with someone\
  \ else; this is why I travel for, to cherish and celebrate every life; after all,\
  \ the ultimate adventure is being alive."
