Text: "Going down the Alps, we see the monochrome of Alps gradually turning green.\
  \ However, \u201CThe weather\u201D, showing us \u201Cplus\u201D outside the train,is\
  \ pulling our legs in a such a cruel way, that something we don\u2019t feel them.\
  \ Just a glance on the locals in autumn coats makes ours frost-resistant-Russian\
  \ bones vibrate like strings of balalaika. \nWe proceed to the trains of the underground,\
  \ every single minute desiring to pay for the trip. Unfortunately, we are completely\
  \ unaware of the ticket system, so we just reach our place without fulfilling our\
  \ desire. \nWe live almost in the center, in a quite old apartment with a very bright\
  \ and spacious rooms and entry through the gay-cinema. We\u2019re taken aback by\
  \ heights: of the ceilings and of the guys outside. In order to suit that common\
  \ sublimity we\u2019re heading to Belvedere. Street artists apparently prepare us\
  \ to \xAB\_The kiss\_\xBB with Klimt. Would recommend. \nSatisfied mind goes down\
  \ to unsatisfied stomach. By the way, Vienna schnitzel would satisfy two stomachs.\
  \ By the way, S.Freud was right (at least in the question, concerning the strudel\
  \ in Landtmann, nothing sponsored). \nWe go home, accompanied by a joker in the\
  \ pack (in fact, nothing more than simple Jack) and sounds of opera in the air.\n\
  The best city for life in 2012 strikes us with its contrasts. You don\u2019t understand\
  \ it, but in the last minute desperately  want to come back."
