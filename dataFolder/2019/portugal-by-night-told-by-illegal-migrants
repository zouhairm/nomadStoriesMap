Text: European countries have been portrayed as the land of beauty, success, blossoming
  lands, lands of all lust with beautiful lights during nights. That is on movies
  but on real is life always like on movies? Not sure. Illegal migrants will not say
  that in Europ mainly in Portugal they have found what they dreamed for while immigrating
  in clandestinity. Obviously, things are not like they thought they should be. The
  welcoming lights spots and houses subject of beauty become something else. Clandestine
  immigrants soonly realized that Europe is not as welcoming as they thought it should
  be. They start wandering, living from place to another place like bohemians against
  there will. Feeling the cold, heat, the fear of being caught. In one word, they
  do no more live when the immigrate in clandestinity in Europe. I want to tell a
  story of illegal migrants. How do they go to bed, where do they sleep, how do they
  compare their nights in Africa and in Europe. I want to tell the story in that perspective.
  I think it will help many Africans to better understand and know why they shouldn't
  immigrate in clandestinity. This travel story will raise people concern about how
  difficult it is to live in somewhere we were not invited to.
