Text: "Flying out of Bhutan\u2019s Paro Airport is one of the most spectacular flights\
  \ you\u2019ll ever take without a zipline. Only eight pilots qualify to fly there.\
  \ The Drukair A319 slithers up the mountainsides from the valley floor, weaving\
  \ between 18,000-foot mountain peaks. Houses\u2014at eye level, right there\u2014\
  so close, you see wheelbarrows, dog collars, doorknobs.\n\nSoon after take-off,\
  \ a menagerie of mountains arrives, one mammoth after another, a feral skein of\
  \ natural beauty devouring a dark blue sky. The South Face of Everest peers through\
  \ your window like the king of the pride, wearing a wild, flowing mane of cirrus.\
  \  \n\nI fear what I might find in Katmandu because the recent Gorkha earthquake\
  \ killed almost 9,000 people, injured nearly 22,000, threatens cholera and typhus.\
  \ With a magnitude of 7.8 and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (translated, that\
  \ means Freakin-butt Violent), the quake demolished, or weakened, many atavistic\
  \ traditional structures\u2014still lying in rubble piles, or unrepaired. You may\
  \ wonder why wealthier countries don\u2019t offer more assistance, why the bottom\
  \ line isn\u2019t raised up where people suffer, rather than puddling around the\
  \ ankles of the world where money thrives.\n\nIn Katmandu, I meander the devastated\
  \ alleys.  I enter a Buddhist paraphernalia shop on Freak Street merely to window\
  \ shop. I have coveted one of those hammered singing bowls for years, decades really.\
  \ One bowl here seems decidedly finer than others I\u2019ve examined: its vibe,\
  \ its feel, its tone astound me. Due to the daily, government-mandated power outages,\
  \ Binod, the shop owner, cannot accept plastic. I intended to buy nothing but cappuccinos;\
  \ I carry only sixty dollars and a few thousand Nepalese rupees in my pocket. Binod\
  \ is asking $175: the bowl is ancient, in perfect condition, very thin, the highest\
  \ quality. Its sound, superior. Remarkably superior\u2014you can easily hear three\
  \ different tones at once. I want that bowl. I would buy it, but don\u2019t have\
  \ the 175 bucks. \n\t\t\t\t\nJoyless confession here: because the earthquake created\
  \ a dearth of tourists, and rampant dire straits, Binod reluctantly offers me the\
  \ bowl for my $60 plus 1500 rupees. Amazon sells smaller bowls, newer, thicker,\
  \ much-lower quality, for $158. Ambivalence\u2014ecstasy and guilt\u2014flows through\
  \ me like muddy water in a rice-field terrace.\n\nAt the airport when departing\
  \ Katmandu, I decide to upgrade to Business Class\u2014surprisingly inexpensive\
  \ here. After six months of constant budget travel, all the flights, the hustle\
  \ and bustle, the rickshaws, proas, taxis, treks, travails, longtails, decaying\
  \ hotels, customs, hucksters, meals with noodles and rice and spices and dodgy ingredients,\
  \ I just want to luxuriate into something familiar, mundane, comfortable. I want\
  \ to believe I\u2019ve earned it. But I surmise that, really, I\u2019m just plain\
  \ tired. \n\nI realize I\u2019m no longer the rabid traveler I once was: the kind\
  \ of man who would never consider Business, who would carry his backpack from the\
  \ ferry to a hotel in the heat of day at the equator during monsoons, the kind of\
  \ backpacker Bhutan now boycotts. The tired man I\u2019ve become walks into Tribhuvan\
  \ International\u2019s uncrowded Business Class lounge at 7 pm on 9 April 2016.\
  \ They serve brownies, and ice cream. I acquire a whole couch and a corner of the\
  \ room to myself. I begin to feel almost\u2026indifferent, serene.\n\nAnd then,\
  \ without warning, it hits: earthquake tremors.  In downtown Katmandu and Durbur\
  \ Square, locals dash outside to open spaces. They move away from buildings reinforced\
  \ with wood-beam scaffolding. Fear runs slightly amok. A young Nepali girl carries\
  \ a small dog in each arm, a mother covers her baby\u2019s head. The tremor measures\
  \ 4.5 on the Richter. \n\nInside the airport, some travelers wobble while wheeling\
  \ their carry-ons. Inside the Business lounge, people sink into sumptuous chairs,\
  \ eyes widen, eyebrows lift, foreheads furrow, lips part. One grizzled old man wheezes\
  \ as he sighs. Apparently, we don\u2019t harbor the same level of fear as Nepalis.\
  \ Perhaps, we imagine this like a fire drill: ignore it, it\u2019ll go away. Perhaps,\
  \ we have faith in a benevolent god. Perhaps, we\u2019re good-at-going-with-the-flow\
  \ New Agers and believe we\u2019re exactly where we belong. I take a bite of brownie\u2014\
  if this is the end, I\u2019m going down with chocolate in my mouth."
