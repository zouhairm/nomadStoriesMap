Text: "As I remember, we always moved on. I can resume our life in few boxes. We didn\u2019\
  t choose the place. We didn\u2019t have any choice about this life. However, it\
  \ become an instinct. This gypsy life was inside me. Deeply\u2026 I tried, I really\
  \ tried to change it, to convince myself. I was so afraid to be different, not a\
  \ normal girl. This kind of normality I didn\u2019t have right to get during my\
  \ childhood. This kind of normality escaping more when I was teenager. I tried step\
  \ by step to get a normal life when I became adult. But what\u2019s this? What is\
  \ normality? What are the limit of this word? I lied to myself so many time about\
  \ this. I escaped what I am like so much people in this world. So many guys want\
  \ to have more than be...\n\nI wanna die so many time, I got crazy about this life.\
  \ I destroyed myself, I damaged my soul for becomming this normal and perfect woman\
  \ that people expected around me. Of course, it never works. You can lie yourself\
  \ for sure. It\u2019s exausting but you can. For everybody, I was and I stay this\
  \ kind of strange and nice girl, cynical but with a lot of ideals at the same time.\
  \ I lost myself\u2026 so I decided to escape this normality. I abandoned all.. my\
  \ relationship, my job, my room. I understood I would close a chapter forever. I\
  \ put the key on the table. I flight. I recognize this sensation of freedom inside\
  \ me. I couldn\u2019t explain it by words. \n\n\nStep by step, I adapted myself\
  \ in this new life. New country, new mission, new people. I knew it would be not\
  \ so easy\u2026 I was wonderfull to capture these moments. First snow of the year.\
  \ Inside my room, I saw this beautiful landscape. So marvellous. I could spent hours\
  \ close to my window, thinking, days and nights. Thinking about him, about what\
  \ we could do together if we continued\u2026 if I didn\u2019t choose this freedom,\
  \ if I didn\u2019t escape this life. Time passed. Hours, days, months...We are in\
  \ spring. Flowers are coming. I enjoy this. Backpack, hours of buses, this journey\
  \ continue. I crossed this country in so many ways. I learned a lot\u2026 more than\
  \ I could imagine. Dreaming landscapes, hiking more and more\u2026 Catching views,\
  \ eating berries\u2026 When I arrived, it was so weird for me to try their food.\
  \ Our stomach is a reflect of our soul, you can adapt yourself or not. I became\
  \ addict of their Kofola, of their montains, of their moravian, their Knedilkis\u2026\
  \ What\u2019s happen to me? It\u2019s like a drug, I can\u2019t stop it. I\u2019\
  m like a newborn who grow up step by step. Everyday could be a victory. New place,\
  \ new words, I\u2019m trying, I\u2019m failing. Try again, don\u2019t stop. Spring\
  \ arrived sunny days too. It was so different this time. For them, for us, for me.\
  \ So hot, so sunny, we approched 30 degres\u2026 we could see hamacs everywhere\u2026\
  \ Summer, tents and new countryside again. Local, expat and tourist were mixing\
  \ in these places for the same reason\_: being in nowhere, being ourselves. We could\
  \ lost our mind in front of this bonfire. Piano was burning and we spoke about our\
  \ life, our dreams, our fears. And we left again\u2026 Our life continued.\n\nDays,\
  \ weeks, new people appeared and disapeared. Time pass faster than I expected. Time\
  \ is so similar to happyness. You can\u2019t catch it, you can\u2019t realize really.\
  \ You must appreciate and that\u2019s all. Backpack is ready. I put the key on the\
  \ table, a new journey is waiting me. A new place is calling me. One year here changed\
  \ me as much as imagine. \n\nHowever, I can\u2019t stop to think I failed to save\
  \ us. Freedom or love. Always."
