Text: "Travelling alone has always made me uncomfortable but I have always been familiar\
  \ with my destination. Travelling to the Philippines I remember feeling completely\
  \ inexperienced, inadequate and scared. I thought all my worst fears would materialise,\
  \ my bags would get lost, my items would be stolen and you know what... some of\
  \ them did. I landed in Manila with a sleeping bag and a spare shirt in tears. \n\
  \n\nAs soon as I found the courage to leave the airport I walked right into my coordinator.\
  \ We filed a claim for my missing bag, I was confused and alone in a new country\
  \ with no expectations. As we got to the accommodation I kept convincing myself\
  \ I was doing this for the greater good, to benefit a people to the best of my ability.\
  \ However as I lay their thinking about the next twenty-nine days, that night felt\
  \ like the longest night of my life.\n\nThe next day I woke up feeling calmer, my\
  \ IVHQ family was very helpful and supportive, providing me with everything i needed\
  \ from towels to a toothbrush. Suddenly I stopped feeling so alone. As I walked\
  \ onto the beach before breakfast all my fears washed away and instead my lungs\
  \ expanded with warm salty air. The pineapples and watermelons at breakfast replenished\
  \ my energy and it was time to experience the village.  \n\nLuckily the next day\
  \ my bag arrived and I could give my attention to my surrounding more completely.\
  \ We walked on the dirt roads amongst the trees and into local businesses. We were\
  \ taught to construct roofs of houses with dried banana leaves. Working with my\
  \ hands, being able to create something useful out of bare necessities was inspiring.\
  \ I was filled with a sense of accomplishment and peace that I do not come across\
  \ often. \n\nOur mentors taught us how to cook a local meal, and we spent the rest\
  \ of the evening playing volleyball and learning authentic dances. That night I\
  \ was lying on the beach when an unfortunate incident demanded that I return home\
  \ immediately. \n\nI lay on the sand looking up at the stars acknowledging my turmoil\
  \ of emotions over the past 24 hours. My fear turned to gratitude, which then turned\
  \ into chaos once more. In the car on the way to the airport I was admiring the\
  \ green uneven landscape.  \n\nI met people of all ages from all over the world\
  \ who had travelled far to find themselves and give back in the process. I admired\
  \ myself for attempting to be part of this and for coming as far as I did. I count\
  \ myself lucky to have found a country so far away from home that made me feel welcome\
  \ in less than twelve hours. That is the real achievement. \n\n Travelling opens\
  \ you up to look past differences and realise all human beings are the same in every\
  \ corner of the world. Everyone needs and deserves the same kind of love and respect.\
  \ The people of Palawan embody this philosophy, I recommend everyone to leap into\
  \ the unknown occasionally, more often than not you may not find what you expected\
  \ but something even better."
