Text: "I watch from the car windows S\xE3o Paulo\u2019s sugar cane farms giving way\
  \ to araucaria trees as we cross the border into Paran\xE1. A thousand kilometers\
  \ stand between our starting point and the Igua\xE7u Falls, and my father is determined\
  \ to cross them all in one day. By my side, Gabriel grins at the endless green landscape.\
  \ He is the reason of our road trip.\nEvery time he visits us we try to show him\
  \ a little bit of Brazil - its culture, history, people and richness. Born to Brazilian\
  \ parents in the United States, my cousin was six years old the first time he came\
  \ to the motherland. It was love at first sight, and Brazil became his favorite\
  \ travel destination. He developed a strong interest for the Igua\xE7u Falls after\
  \ seeing it pictured in the Soarin\u2019 ride at Epcot during a trip to Florida.\
  \ And so, as soon as he arrives in Brazil, we decide to hit the road.\nThe next\
  \ day, as we wait in line for the double-decker bus that will take us to the start\
  \ of the trail leading to the falls, we try to identify all the languages people\
  \ are talking around us and fail miserably. When our turn finally comes, we rush\
  \ through the stairs to the top of the bus. The cold winter wind hits our faces\
  \ with violence, making it almost impossible to breathe at points. We are sure to\
  \ get a sinusitis crisis after this, but we don\u2019t care. The view is worth it.\n\
  We hop out of the bus at the stop and make our way to the trailhead. Although we\
  \ want to sprint through the paths and stairs leading to the gem of the National\
  \ Park, we fill our lungs with the freshest air we ever breathed and take our time\
  \ to see the smaller cascades, enjoy the smell of wet earth, observe the quatis,\
  \ read the poem we found engraved in the rocks dating back to the construction of\
  \ the trail and let ourselves connect to the mighty nature.\nThe water sound gets\
  \ louder and louder as we make our way throughout the park. We pick up the pace,\
  \ in a hurry to get up close and personal with the stars of the show: the biggest\
  \ waterfalls. When we get to the start of the observation bridge that allows us\
  \ to get closer to the Falls, my mom decides to wait for us at the snack bar at\
  \ the end of the trail - she\u2019s afraid of heights.\nAround us, we see people\
  \ wearing raincoats to enter the bridge. We go as we are - we want to feel the splashes\
  \ of water, appreciate the breeze that hits our faces carried by the wind. We make\
  \ our way slowly through the multitude, Gabe holding my hand and I holding my father\u2019\
  s. There is no rush. We try to memorize every little thing so this moment can last\
  \ forever. We identify a tree branch hanging close to the cataract as the one Franz\
  \ Kohlenberger, one of the National Park\u2019s greatest lovers and adventurers,\
  \ is seated on in a picture we had just seen at the museum. Dad points to the top\
  \ of the waterfall and shows us the tourists at the Argentinian side - they look\
  \ like colorful dots to us.\nAt last, we get to the end of the bridge and look around\
  \ at the Devil\u2019s Throat in all its magnificence. And we just stand there, staring\
  \ at one of the most beautiful things on the planet, hand in hand. We can feel the\
  \ power of this place, the force of the water coming from all directions, the brightness\
  \ of the sun shining in our skins, the songs of the birds flying around us, the\
  \ rainbow glowing over the water and the amazement of everyone there. We don\u2019\
  t have to say a word. We let the deafening sound of water do all the talking."
