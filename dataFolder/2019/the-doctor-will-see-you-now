Text: "\u2018The doctor will see you now\u2019 says the hotel receptionist, perkily\
  \ swishing her ponytail as she hands me my room keys.\n\u2018Um\u2026\u2026?\u2019\
  \ I must look a bit forlorn, wilting in the unexpectedly warm and strangely ferrous\
  \ atmosphere, knees buckling under the weight of my rucksack. Really, I just want\
  \ to find my room and have a shower.\n\u2018Follow her\u2019 she insists, pointing\
  \ a burnished fingernail towards an altogether more homely woman in a tabard. I\
  \ do as I am told and follow the woman and her mop through labyrinthine corridors\
  \ to a bright, sparse waiting room, where I wait for \u2026.. what? \nI had come\
  \ to Jermuk, a pretty spa town in southern Armenia, to breathe some wholesome air,\
  \ enjoy gentle wooded walks, and catch up on reading; a kind of mini-break on my\
  \ six month journey along the Silk Road. But as I look around at the other guests\
  \ it is becoming increasingly clear that this is no ordinary hotel, and my hopes\
  \ of complementary travel sized toiletries (or even gin and tonic) begin to fade.\
  \ Drab track-suited families sit patiently in lines looking out over the sunny lawns\
  \ through huge picture windows. Occasionally someone flip-flops over the polished\
  \ linoleum, proffering papers to a Nurse Ratchett look-alike who watches proceedings\
  \ from behind a utilitarian desk. It suddenly dawns on me that I have inadvertently\
  \ checked myself in for three nights at an ex-Soviet sanatorium. \nMy name is called\
  \ several times before I recognise myself through the unfamiliar pronunciation.\
  \ The doctor looks childlike in her important white coat, but despite her youthful\
  \ demeanour, she has an oddly comforting gravitas. She speaks to me in Armenian\
  \ and then in Russian. I speak neither, so we point at bits of my body and gesticulate.\
  \ It is hard to know what to try and communicate given that I am not ill and do\
  \ not really want to see a doctor. Eventually the woman from reception is summoned\
  \ to help with translation, and after five minutes I have a personalised itinerary\
  \ of \u2018treatments\u2019 for my unspecified ailments.  I am suddenly very thirsty\
  \ but there is nowhere to buy a drink. I am told to drink the water out of the bathroom\
  \ tap, but it is very brown and I just don\u2019t fancy it. That night I sleep fitfully.\n\
  Nine-thirty a.m. Paraffin therapy. I\u2019m slightly anxious that they will burn\
  \ me with it or make me drink it, but in fact I am laid on a trestle table and a\
  \ pouch of warm paraffin is draped across my shoulders. It is very soothing. This\
  \ is followed by a mineral bath. I am not sure what to expect and am relieved to\
  \ see that I get a bathtub to myself, separated from my neighbours by a low wall.\
  \ An attendant pops in every five minutes or so to top up the scalding earthy water\
  \ in my huge tub and slosh it around with a grey flannel. I emerge after half an\
  \ hour shiny and slightly smelly and go in search of treatment number three \u2013\
  \ healing tea. By now I am so thirsty that I help myself to four cups of the medicinal\
  \ liquid, which results in stern words from the therapist. I begin to feel mildly\
  \ institutionalised, maybe a little cowed as I succumb to the final treatments of\
  \ the day \u2013 electric currents to my spine and a bitter inhalation. \nBack in\
  \ my room I am strangely melancholic, and worry that I may have overdone the healing\
  \ tea in my attempt to rehydrate. Uncharacteristically for me, I imagine the ghosts\
  \ of the first guests at this extraordinary place lingering in the sultry corridors,\
  \ clinging to the hope that these curious treatments will work their magic and restore\
  \ their ailing bodies. I hear them coming from every corner of the Soviet Union,\
  \ speaking Tajik, Uzbek, Georgian, pilgrims in search of health and vitality, and\
  \ the strength to return to work with their comrades. I pull myself together and\
  \ walk out through the stuffy lobby onto the clipped lawn and into a pool of sunshine,\
  \ glad of the piney air and the freedom to move on."
