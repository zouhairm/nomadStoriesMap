Text: "Hello, \n\nIam Oktafirda yeni, I love travel and i dont why i never feeling\
  \ tired when i walking to see the world.\nOMG I really love ocean and Traveling,\
  \ I didnt know why but Iam Really love that\n\nThe story about me and the boy from\
  \ Pasific Ocean.\nOne day i have oppurtunity to Jayapura city. You know when i see\
  \ Papua from Plane I cant describe anything except grateful.\n\nI Think its only\
  \ Jayapura how about Raja Ampat. I Really dream to come Raja Ampat one day..\n\n\
  The first time, I landed to Sentani Airport and you know Its the first time i see\
  \ Road behind Sea.. Its wonderful thing i ever see.\n\nIn the plane i get new friend\
  \ and he talk to me to invite me to walking around Jayapura city. Its the boy From\
  \ the Pasific Ocean He ask me and greeting with me on plane. Its very fun but My\
  \ heart already scary. Because my mom Always talking about be careful with people\
  \ you didnt know. But I didnt care because maybe i didnt have another reason to\
  \ come Jayapura next time. \n\nSo I travel to Jayapura only transit on jakarta.\
  \ Boarding past from Palembang at 5pm and Boarding past On soekarno Hatta to Sentani\
  \ Airport at 21.00. We was Arrived To Sentani at 6am WIT. \n\nAbout Price my Ticket\
  \ Travel Palembang to jakarta is Rp. 500.000 and Jakarta jayapura is 1.900.000.\
  \ \nI didnt order ticket direcly because lion palembang to jakarta sold out. So\
  \ i take flight with batik air. Ya iam really happy take flight with batik because\
  \ i get tanggo waffers. \n\nTravel from sentani to doc 4 i not see jayapura etnic\
  \ house like we know. Jayapura is city like Palembang but only have one mall. On\
  \ my opion its already good because The mall have bioskop and Restauran like Palembang.\
  \ \nThe people not like my imagination about Africa people on movies because we\
  \ see too much transmigran from Sumatera and Java but not dominan. I mean the people\
  \ negro not Dominan like the little island. \n\nIam really confuse at first time\
  \ because i see my wristwatch is 4am. But the sun has shone brightly. And My friend\
  \ told me if this time is 6pm WIT and my Wristwatch setting was WIB. hihi \n\nOne\
  \ day with him explore jayapura city. But he have friend too. \nAt the time Jokowi\
  \ Sir already have skyland its a little cafe high and very-very good place because\
  \ i can see See, Island and Tower Red and White or it can be called as transmitter.\
  \ We order coconout young ice its very good memory.\n\nPrevious we viser the peak\
  \ of Jayapura City. OMG you can see dock and cowlick jayapura like you see on Map\
  \ its same thing but in the real i can describe. But I never stop talking Alhamdulilah.\
  \ Because from the peak of jayapura i didnt see anything island and I believe the\
  \ Theory if earth is round is true. \n\nSame times i know if the ocean Pasific have\
  \ big wave from Hamadi beach. \n\nThe last place is Park of Pertamina on jayapura\
  \ city. the place is behind Dock. Too much a ship not functioning but its place\
  \ to live. The indonesia Flags become dull on the boat.\n\nBack to Palembang and\
  \ our Connection bad. Lost contact so i never have call and message from him. \n\
  \nThis really good memory i get, I hope i can have oppurtunity to travel to portugal\
  \ and talk about another Wonderful travel. Aamiin"
