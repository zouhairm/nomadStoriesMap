Text: "Lithe brown shoulders flexing with each paddle stroke, Roy (when asked his\
  \ real name he merely smiled and offered no answer) deftly turns around in the canoe\
  \ and yells \u201Chow old do you think I am?\u201D It\u2019s less a schoolmaster\u2019\
  s question than a Sphinx\u2019s riddle. The answer comes in short order \u2013 \u201C\
  65!\u201D The people of Alappuzha (Alleppey), it turns out, are quick to share in\
  \ everything they have. A pride in looking young included.\n\nRoy is a marvel. Perched\
  \ at the front of the three man canoe, he skims his boat over the Keralan backwaters\
  \ with as little effort as the slim-necked egrets gliding silently to rest nearby,\
  \ their twig legs refraction bent on the sunlit floodplain. Here on this seemingly\
  \ unnavigable series of interconnected lakes and canals, the jungle meets the Malabar\
  \ Coast. 900km of rivers and lagoons, teeming with life, separate the Arabian Sea\
  \ from the great landmass of Mother India. We paddle through the heat of the day,\
  \ me hand-blistered and sun-baked, Roy humming serenely, head wrapped in the t-shirt\
  \ which he routinely removes and dips in the water.\n\nRoy arrived early in the\
  \ morning. He slipped through the jasmine-tangled gates of our homestay and waited\
  \ with patience for the finishing of a breakfast of stewed pineapple chutneys, amber\
  \ hunks of cool guava and sweet bananas, short and fat as a sailor\u2019s thumb.\
  \ When asked the previous day about the possibility of hiring a berth on one of\
  \ the giant, ornate tourist houseboats famous in these parts, our host, Biju, had,\
  \ in the most gentle way possible, taken stern charge of our plans and explained\
  \ that the giant cruisers were bad for the environment and for local communities.\
  \ The trade in backwater tours which the locals have been plying for decades has\
  \ run aground against the tides of big business. Independents like his friend Roy\
  \ do not possess motors or swanky comforts, they simply offer themselves and the\
  \ chance to participate in the experience of life here, blisters and all.\n\nA water\
  \ bus out from the public jetties in town is the closest we get to luxury travel.\
  \ The scratched perspex windows give out onto an hour of views which move from dusty\
  \ town streets to wide, shimmering lakes. The waters are dominated by huge wooden\
  \ houseboats where families of tourists sit on deck, breakfasting at tables made\
  \ for individual enjoyment. When asked about the boats which line the watersides\
  \ and sit proud and high on the imperceptible swell, Roy turns and spits into the\
  \ lake.\n\nFrom the launch point at his house, where he and his factotum offer half\
  \ day rowing trips, we head out into the local channels. Among the frying pan-sized\
  \ lotus leaves unseen fish nip polite o\u2019s on the silent surface, while in the\
  \ intermittent palms overhead dazzling kingfishers screech their undulating calls.\
  \ Along the way, people occasionally appear from wooden houses and drowsily beat\
  \ their washing dry or splash cups of water over the buffalo cooling off in the\
  \ shadows. The only thing missing are the big boats, too wide and heavy to occupy\
  \ the same narrow straits as our canoe. Given the comparisons between here and Venice,\
  \ their presence would be like that city\u2019s visiting cruise ships squeezing\
  \ under the Ponte dei Sospiri.\n\nAfter hours under the unblinking sun we are tired\
  \ and our hands feel raw where the web of the thumb has worn away to a ragged red.\
  \ Back at their house, our guide and his wife feed us a thali of local dishes, all\
  \ served on a banana leaf in the bedroom of their now grown-up son.\n\nTheir food,\
  \ their house and their world is ours to share for a short while. After lunch I\
  \ fall asleep on a wall outside the house and when I wake it\u2019s time to leave.\
  \ It\u2019s been a beautiful but not always comfortable experience, one which feels\
  \ true to the spirit of the place and its people. It\u2019s something which the\
  \ two German couples in the other canoe, crisply sunburnt and ready for home, would\
  \ readily attest to."
