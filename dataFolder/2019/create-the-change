Text: "As a young fellow aspiring to create change in my community, I find life as\
  \ an amazing fact that needs to be understood by many people who seem to have a\
  \ clue about what it is. I ounce was into a loop, allow me call it a rat race where\
  \ I used to do the same things every now and then. little did I know that the greatest\
  \ things are found out of what you are familiar with doing often or daily (comfort\
  \ zone). I did lean that when you are out of your comfort zone you tend to achieve\
  \ much more than you can imagine. \n\nTo achieve what you aspire to achieve you\
  \ can not do it single handed but rather as a team. I discovered that if you want\
  \ to succeed do it alone but if you want to succeed and go far so fast do it as\
  \ a team. just as i ounce read in a book which says in a quote \"you rather own\
  \ 10% of something great than holding 100% of something small\" with this I learned\
  \ that to be a great personality you need raise a team that is build on trust togetherness\
  \ and love. Am now on a quest to create a strong team and network that will push\
  \ us to success as it is more satisfying to see people grow with better skills and\
  \ knowledge with support from each other this create love, unity and peace.\n\n\
  Supporting others grow has always been in me but i had not yet realized it not until\
  \ I got out of my comfort zone which has indeed helped  me a lot to create the change\
  \ I want to see in the community. most times always used to complain alot seeing\
  \ things not changing around my community not until I took action. I learnt a lesson\
  \ that nothing can ever change around you or in your life not until you take action\
  \ over what happens in your life or around you, that is the only way to create the\
  \ change.\n\nYou are probably thinking of what I did to create the change an talking\
  \ about, well I will share with you briefly. I did take some time and made some\
  \ research and found out that Africa, Uganda has various challenges but most of\
  \ all the challenges is poverty where most people live on or under a dollar for\
  \ survival for a day, yet they have all the resources they need to make changes\
  \ around the poverty and better their lives to a good standard. Also I discovered\
  \ that most youths who finish school do not get taken up by the job market and end\
  \ up becoming idlers in the community which leads to high crime rates. I and  my\
  \ team founded Innovation Nest, an organisational enterprise to nature youths the\
  \ skills of startup development in both tech and business enterprise. this has indeed\
  \  inspired many youths to startup their own enterprises that solve challenges in\
  \ the community we come from and this has and is indeed creating change that we\
  \ want to see and all this is done with passion.\n\nI conclude by saying as youths\
  \ we need to work together to create change in the communities we come from not\
  \ waiting for people from elsewhere, because they only come to help when you have\
  \ started helping yourself. I wish you the best all as you aspire to create change\
  \ in your communities. and change the world we see today."
