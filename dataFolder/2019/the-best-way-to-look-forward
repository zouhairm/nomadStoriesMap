Text: "\u201CSo how many of you here have watched Narcos?\u201D the tour guide inevitably\
  \ asked. Depending on the group, answers would vary, usually you could bank on at\
  \ least half of the people to raise their hands. \u201CI haven\u2019t,\u201D I whispered\
  \ to the woman sitting next to me in the van, \u201CBut after spending two weeks\
  \ here I feel like I\u2019ll need to when I get home.\u201D She laughed, \u201C\
  I know\u201D she replied, \u201CI feel like I\u2019ll want to compare it to the\
  \ real thing.\u201D  That day we were on the Transformation tour, which like many\
  \ of the other tours would touch on Pablo Escobar and the impact he had on the city\
  \ of Medellin. I didn\u2019t know very much about Escobar beforehand, and the little\
  \ I knew about him made him seem more like a villain from a comic book than a real\
  \ person. Being there, in that city gave the story roots, and made it come alive\
  \ right before my eyes. It showed the highs and lows of the entire city, and the\
  \ depths that it needed to go too, to bounce back from that. \n\tOur first stop\
  \ was outside an apartment building that, even though nearly 30 years had passed\
  \ since anyone in the family had lived there, it still clearly had Escobar etched\
  \ down its\u2019 right side. We gathered together outside the building, awe struck\
  \ by what we were seeing. Our group were the only ones there, so all you could hear\
  \ was our guides\u2019 voice talking about the history of the building and the family\
  \ during their time there. \u201CWhen we were kids, my mother worked as the Escobar\u2019\
  s cleaning lady\u201D our guide explained, \u201Cwhen they found out, that she had\
  \ a son around their son\u2019s age who went to the same school, they invited me\
  \ over for a play date. Now this wasn\u2019t necessarily a family you could say\
  \ no to so she had no choice but to bring me,\u201D he told us. From the stories\
  \ that he told, it sounded like the inside of that apartment was a wonderland with\
  \ the family residing in the penthouse, while lower levels were left for the business.\
  \ The Escobar family left in 1988 after the building was attacked. Since then it\u2019\
  s been left empty, which just added to the overall creepy feeling I got while being\
  \ across the street. What came across as a huge shock to me was that the city government\
  \ was debating putting in a children\u2019s playground on the grounds of the building.\
  \ But, as our guide explained to us, they wanted some of the area to go towards\
  \ a positive thing for the community. \n\t\u201CNow we are heading to the infamous\
  \ jail that Escobar built for himself, and then escaped from. To this day, it\u2019\
  s unconfirmed how he broke out, and given the location it was clearly a creative\
  \ escape,\u201D our guide said. As we got closer, I saw what he meant. For starters,\
  \ the jail is at the top of a huge mountain; with guards posted at the only exit\
  \ to the main road presumably searching any cars that left the premises. When we\
  \ got to the top, half of the original jail was preserved, letting time take its\
  \ toll. Walking around the ruins of the jail, I could feel my skin starting to crawl\
  \ as the guide described all the splendour inside, from the casino, to the parties\
  \ he would have, to the helicopter pad that was on site. As we returned to the entrance,\
  \ he then directed our attention to the second half of the area, recently repurposed\
  \ to be a retirement home. Once a week groceries were delivered, and this he explained\
  \ in detail was another way for the community to benefit from a place that had darker\
  \ roots. Half of the jail is left up, partially for tourists and partially for local\
  \ people to understand what happened there. For someone who comes from a place where\
  \ they stop making our country the focus of our history lessons early on, it was\
  \ refreshing to see the way that Medellin as a whole looks to the future without\
  \ blocking out the past."
