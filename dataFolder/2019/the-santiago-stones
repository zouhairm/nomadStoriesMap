Text: 'A man in his late 40s, an accountant from England, divorced, alcoholic and
  struggling to come to terms with his daughters move away to Portugal.

  He is successful but longs for more. He purchases a motorbike after not riding for
  more than 25 years, and takes the Santiago trail.

  Travelling through the country he manages to see the world through loves eyes, romances,
  friends and families are all around on his journey.

  However, once he gets into Portugal, he learns his sister has been missing for 4
  years.

  A sheepish man at best, our protagonist Neil, must find his daughter and track her
  back Across the Santiago trail, learning that the formerly friendly people he met
  were not who they seemed to be.

  Is there something bigger going on in all of this, is he the cause of all his own
  misfortune.


  I have many drafts at the moments and variations of the story but I long for a trip
  like this to focus the mind in order to get my head around what I really want to
  write.


  I know this is short but there are so many variations. I am 24 years old and have
  written many drafts but cannot move on to the next stage. I work 60+ hours a week
  and simply do not have the time or resources to become the writer I know I can be'
