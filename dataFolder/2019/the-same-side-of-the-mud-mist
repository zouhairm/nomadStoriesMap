Text: "\u201CSee that man standing by the Vi\u1EC7t C\u1ED9ng vets? He was shot twice\
  \ in his torso, Miss. Thought he was left to die in the rubber plantations overnight,\u201D\
  \ Number 4 mutters, eyes wide. \n\nMy parents brought me up with good manners. Be\
  \ polite, Maddie, don\u2019t stare, always say please and thank you. But now I\u2019\
  m staring, trying to envision how it would feel to think you were handcuffed by\
  \ the grips of death, all alone in a foreign country. \n\nThe journalism student\
  \ in me wants to furiously scribble interview notes in a murky mess of  shorthand,\
  \ dimpling the following page. The aspiring documentary maker in me wants to hold\
  \ my camera low against my stomach, a fly on the rubber plantations, recording relationships\
  \ once thought impossible. The daughter in me wants to hold the hands of the fathers\
  \ and grandfathers speaking solemn stories of PTSD.\n\nIt\u2019s the 18th of August,\
  \ 2016. 50 years since 105 Australians and 3 New Zealanders from D Coy 6 RAR defeated\
  \ roughly 2,500 Vi\u1EC7t C\u1ED9ng and North Vietnamese army. A ten to one numerical\
  \ superiority. \n\nGinger and star anise do a little v\u0169 phi\u1EBFn dance in\
  \ the ceramic bowl in front of us. Bone broth shouldn\u2019t tempt a vegetarian,\
  \ but its warm and homely scent is beckoning its little finger. I am both eyeing\
  \ off a mixing pot, and submerged in one. Veterans from both sides of The Battle\
  \ of the Long Tan surround me, sharing harrowing narratives and lunch.\n\nI fiddle\
  \ tensely with the disposable film camera I bought from Kmart. I don\u2019t feel\
  \ deserving of a spot at this table. A student from Adelaide who has never experienced\
  \ such torture or anguish. My skin sticks like fresh gum to this white plastic chair.\
  \ My corn coloured rain coat moulds to the shape of my arms. Strands of my hair\
  \ are sprawled in an oily mess across my forehead. Humidity is not my pal today.\
  \ Number 4 is though. \n\nShe leans into Jason, grinning as she shares personal\
  \ jokes I can\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know Number 4\u2019s real name. She\u2019\
  s Jason\u2019s fourth translator. The name feels a bit impersonal to me, but she\
  \ doesn\u2019t seem to mind. \n\nEarlier that morning, I sat cross-legged with Number\
  \ 4 and watched Jason from the top of SAS Hill in Nui Dat. He had a radio in one\
  \ hand and a metal detector in the other. Utterly lost in his search to find relics\
  \ for preservation, an explosive undiscovered from the battle could have gone off\
  \ and I think he might have missed it. I pulled at the dried grass and listened\
  \ studiously to Number 4\u2019s sunny chit-chat. She spilled poems about her home\
  \ town. Invited me to this impromptu event. Told me about Little Trin, one of the\
  \ many local children they teach English with money from Jason\u2019s DVA pension.\
  \ \n\nJason bends over the pho toward me, his greying hair slightly grazing the\
  \ lips of the broth. His voice is low, eyes melancholic. \u201CThere\u2019s been\
  \ talk of me bein\u2019 kicked outta Nam, Maddie. The government here aren\u2019\
  t convinced my intentions are good.\u201D\n\nIt seems maybe the Vietnamese Government\
  \ thinks the line between 'commemoration' and 'celebration' is as foggy as the post\
  \ monsoon \u2018mud mist\u2019 which hung low and heavy on that day in 1966. \n\n\
  Yesterday, 1000 Australian\u2019s who travelled to Vung Tau for the anniversary\
  \ of the battle were left with the taste of condensed-milk-less, sharp Vietnamese\
  \ coffee in their mouths. Only hours before commemoration services were set to begin,\
  \ they were all cancelled, or drastically altered under strict conditions. Little\
  \ Pattie, who was 17 when she performed in Vietnam, was told she couldn\u2019t sing.\
  \ Media outlets were met with stern faced government officials with intimidating\
  \ artillery.\n\nCramped backyards and street food eateries became homes to orphaned\
  \ veteran communities for the day. An asylum for support with humble handmade cook\
  \ ups. \n\nAlthough the official commemoration services were left hopeless, drenched,\
  \ and broken in the muddy rubber plantations of the Ph\u01B0\u1EDBc Tuy Province,\
  \ the soldiers were equipped with weighty, camouflaged backpacks filled with a remarkable\
  \ resilience. This time, however, with men from both sides of the battle on the\
  \ same side of the mud mist."
