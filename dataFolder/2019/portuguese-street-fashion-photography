Text: World is made of beautiful creatures and each part of the world has their own
  beauty. Traveling is a part of life which helps people be get close to blessings
  of God. I am a big fan of traveling and exploring historical places of each country
  also want to get the chance to know more about their culture and lifestyle of different
  people. Including my own home town I have been to six different countries with an
  aim to travel to majority of the cities as I can. Among these countries, I got the
  opportunity do a proper photo-shoot in 13 cities of India and several well-known
  ancient places of Turkey. I think the reason of loving traveling is my past, my
  family had a nomadic life. They use to travel from one place to another according
  to the season shifts. I can see the nurture impact of traveling in me. When I was
  in university I took photography class and passed it with high grades. That photography
  class helped me to be familiar with technical skills of photography and about other
  well-known photographer from whole over the world. This project will give me the
  opportunity to take a shot of new culture and new lifestyle. I am mostly interested
  in dressing of new generation and want to see if people still use traditional clothes
  in the form of fashion or not.  In my university time I was working on a project
  by the name of Street Fashion in Bishkek and it went successfully therefore, want
  to have a successful result in another country too. Moreover, I have worked as a
  documentary maker and photographer in Afghan New Generation Organization for 6 months.
