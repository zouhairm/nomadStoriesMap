Text: "The distance between Ukraine and Crimea is one night train. Although that night\
  \ becomes very long -train stopes almost each hour. What did I know about Crimea?\
  \ Almost nothing. Yes, I saw some pictures of my friends who spent their summer\
  \ vacation at the Black Sea \u2013 happy family beach portraits with sweet corn\
  \ in one hand and stranger with monkey next to them, a few more pictures of some\
  \ tourist attractions that nobody ever remember well...  \n  My Crimea I discovered\
  \ in February. I didn\u2019t go to the sea. I was on the way to the heart of the\
  \ peninsula \u2013 Simferopol. When I woke up in the morning, I realized that my\
  \ pillow was frozen to the window and I hardly can feel my nose. Crimean cold is\
  \ different, in winter it goes right through your bones. I warmed up only in Aishe\u2019\
  s house. \n Aishe was some kind of legend in Simferopol. Together with her family\
  \ she was deported from Crimea to Central Asia in 1944. Because of her strong will,\
  \ sharp mind and bright personality she managed to damage \u201Ciron wall\u201D\
  \ by speaking about situation of Crimean Tatars in Soviet Union to the world, twice\
  \ prisoned, including Lefortovo, by Soviet government, she didn\u2019t have a choice\
  \ but immigrate to USA. Even there she continued her mission by meeting Ronald Reagan\
  \ and other political leaders and speaking the truth at Voice of America and BBC\
  \ that was blocked so well by Soviets. After many years, when Ukraine got independence\
  \ in 1991, Aishe was back in Simferopol. She built house for deported lonely Crimean\
  \ Tatars and kept going to Central Asia and bringing them to this house to their\
  \ home land.  I heard that she was about to plan her next trip to Central Asia.\
  \  \nWhile waiting for Aishe in the quest room, I was observing inhabitants of this\
  \ legendary house. They were busy playing domino, some of them were cheating.. Small\
  \ argument and they continued to play and  retell each other some latest news. I\
  \ didn\u2019t understand Crimean Tatar language but I enjoyed watching their excitement.\
  \ When Aishe entered the room, they got quiet.  \nThere are some people who when\
  \ they speak the true meaning  were hiding somewhere between lines. Talking to Aishe\
  \ I didn\u2019t feel that anything was \u201Cbetween\u201D.  She was very simple\
  \ and open, with same look as on the black-and-white pictures on the wall of her\
  \ room. Even her hair style was same-tight bunch. Some clattering sound from radiator\
  \ interrupted our conversation. \u201CGirls from the kitchen downstairs are calling\
  \ for afternoon coffee\u201D \u2013Aishe  explained. \n\u201CGirls\u201D were 9\
  \ women who actually were working here and taking care of elderly people in the\
  \ house. They were already sitting around the table. Every afternoon together with\
  \ Aishe they were having coffee with come special snack, baked milk with sugar.\
  \ I have to say I thought I had strong coffee before, but nothing was like that\
  \ coffee. I felt that it\u2019s like my heart relocated to my head.  It was some\
  \ kind of ritual that after finishing coffee each of them turned over the cup. \u201C\
  You also turn\u201D \u2013Aishe insisted-\u201CFirst tell her, she is the guest\u201D\
  . The woman in front of Aishe took my cup and looked into it. \u201CShe is my cousin,\
  \ \u2013 Aishe explained.- Whatever she will say is all true\u201D. I was quite\
  \ skeptical but didn\u2019t dare to brake ritual silence. \u201CIn 4 day you will\
  \ get a job..Your life is in a road, but you will never come back here again..\u201D\
  \ \u2013 Aishe\u2019s cousin put my cup on the plate. \nI didn\u2019t think much\
  \ of thecoffee ritual after that day, although in 4 days I got a job offer.  \n\
  Distance between Ukrainian border and Russian checkpoint in Crimean is 7 km and\
  \ there is no transport connection between. I heard that from time to time Aishe\
  \ has to travel to Turkey through Ukraine  where Crimean Tatar diaspora is supporting\
  \ her house for elderly deported Crimean Tatars. Those 7 km she has to walk..."
