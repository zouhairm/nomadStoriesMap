Text: "It was not just closed, its windows were boarded. Matthew, my boyfriend (of\
  \ just a few months at that point), silently stared at the hotel, his mouth agape.\
  \ \u201CChiuso,\u201D I say. \u201CClosed for renovations.\u201D Visions of romance\
  \ at this medieval palace overlooking the Adriatic Sea were now as blind as those\
  \ boarded up windows. If the car radio was not playing \u2018Irreplaceable\u2019\
  \ by Beyonc\xE9 I might have heard his blood boil over.\n\nCue detonation. \u201C\
  Why didn\u2019t you phone ahead?\u201D he bellowed. \n\u201CI tried! They didn\u2019\
  t answer!\u201D\n\u201CWell now we know why!\u201D\n\nI tried to calm him, assuring\
  \ we\u2019d find somewhere to sleep. We had driven five hours already. Were we doomed\
  \ to drive countless more around dead-quiet seaside towns?\n\nPuglia, the region\
  \ at the heel of boot-shaped Italy, seemed gloriously attractive from Australia.\
  \ Now that we were here, we were ready to blame the other for failing to think through\
  \ the implications of coming to this seaside Summer destination in frost-bitten\
  \ January. \n\nWe turned inland. I\u2019d wrenched agreement from him that we should\
  \ drive the extra hour to Ostuni. We drove in stony silence through a patchwork\
  \ of undulating agriculture \u2013 olives, vineyards, vegetables and crops \u2013\
  \ where every inch of fertile land was devoted to produce.\n\nFarmhouse chimneys\
  \ pumped smoke from fireplaces. In spite of the cold, the region struck me as warmly\
  \ inviting. It dawned on me that perhaps Puglia was blameless. Matthew and I were\
  \ simply not traveling well together. What did that bode for us?\n\nI heard him\
  \ giggle. \u201CLook at those places,\u201D he said. He pointed to a town of higgledy-piggledy\
  \ stone houses that looked as if they were wearing cone hats. They made me smile.\
  \ They could not not make you smile.\n\nIn the distance we glimpsed crumbly castles\
  \ looking out to the sea, and ancient towns thrusting up from hills. They looked\
  \ like rock, carved from the very geology of the hill\u2019s heart. It was enchanting.\n\
  \nThousands of olive trees twirled by. Planted rows flickered in the edge of our\
  \ vision like an old film reel not playing quite fast enough. \n\nOstuni appeared\
  \ looming before us. La Citta Bianca. Its white-washed houses looked so tentative,\
  \ as if a breath could send them tumbling. I had to remind myself they\u2019d been\
  \ here for centuries.\n\nWe wound our way up, parked and got out. I exhaled and\
  \ saw the air was mist. Please, I thought, let nothing go wrong.\n\nWe walked into\
  \ the historic centre. We were the only people. Meandering lanes and alleyways quickly\
  \ got us deliciously lost. We were both dazzled by the city\u2019s stark white.\n\
  \n\u201CAre you hungry?\u201D Matthew asked. It was then my heart sank. I noticed\
  \ the ristorantes had turned their signs to Chiuso. We had done it again \u2013\
  \ too late for lunch, too early for dinner \u2013 arriving as the shops closed for\
  \ siesta. \n\nWe were locked out, trapped in a cold maze, curving endlessly around\
  \ us. Matthew went quiet. He closed himself off to me as brittle and frigid as the\
  \ city.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019ll find somewhere,\u201D I promised. \u201CEven some little\
  \ dive.\u201D\n\nJust then a fog rolled in. Thick, marshmallowy fog filled the gap\
  \ between the buildings. It became uncertain what was temporary and what was permanent.\
  \ Matthew\u2019s pace slowed and soon I could hardly make him out.\n\n\u201CMatthew...\
  \ This is so beautiful\u2026 If we were in some restaurant or having siesta right\
  \ now, we would miss this.\u201D As I got closer I saw his eyes were moist.\n\n\
  We saw an open door. Stepping into it we saw stone steps leading down into a grotto.\
  \ It was a restaurant. The owner looked up and we asked if he was still cooking.\
  \ He said they do not close.\n\nI looked at the menu\u2019s insignia. Osteria del\
  \ Tempo Perso. The Inn of Lost Time. \n\nI relayed to the convivial man our concern\
  \ that we\u2019d come to Puglia at the wrong time of year. The white bristles of\
  \ his face shifted around. Hairs which pointed down now pointed up.\n\n\u201COr\
  \ are we here at the right time?\u201D Matthew asked. Everything had dropped away\
  \ to white except the familiar flesh of this man before me. \n\n\u201CYes,\u201D\
  \ he responded. \u201CThis is the best time to visit Puglia.\u201D"
