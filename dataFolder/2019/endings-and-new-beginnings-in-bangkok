Text: "The adventure of my life began on the last day 2013 in Bangkok. Coming out\
  \ of catastrophically failed relationship, I decided to embark on a three month\
  \ solo trip around Southeast Asia. Treks, backpacks and hostels were awaiting for\
  \ me and as an over thirty who had never done anything like this; the fear was palpable.\
  \ \nI arrived in Bangkok on December 31st at midday after 24 hours of flights. I\
  \ quickly found my hostel was such a sweet deal only because it was way away from\
  \ the city. However, I still couldn't contain my excitement. I had made, it was\
  \ on. So, with barely any sleep I set off into the unknown eager and curious. I\
  \ was soon lost and more helpless that I expected. Some kind strangers led me on\
  \ the right way and I landed in the well known Khao San Road. So many people, so\
  \ much food. That would cheer me up right away. Bbq shrimp, pad Thai, fresh pineapple.\
  \ I quickly learnt the best food seemed to come from the dirtiest of stalls. I just\
  \ had to learn to look the other way. After walking around for almost 8 hours, the\
  \ jet lag started to sink in; I could feel myself giving up. I even considered going\
  \ back and skipping New Year's altogether. But, as I a sipped on my cold Tiger beer\
  \ I heard an accordion, a tango, the sounds from home, the voices of my loved ones\
  \ encouraging me to keep going, to find my joy. So I did. \nFollowing my heart and\
  \ the twinkling lights, I arrived at the park where thousands of thais gathered\
  \ to celebrate the arrival of the new year. I was showered by their generosity;\
  \ a palm reading and a massage and soon after I was letting go of my paper balloon\
  \ full of wishes. Life was about to change for me and the fear was starting to subside.\
  \ \nI met some fellow travellers and we shared some more Tigers. The roads were\
  \ blocked, traffic was chaos and so I missed my train back to my far off hostel.\
  \ I was now forced to celebrate the New Year all the way til 6 am. So there was\
  \ more delicious food, more beers, more travellers. More excitement, less and less\
  \ fear.\nBy the time I was ready to go I felt I was confident enough to bargain\
  \ with a tuk tuk driver. I had been warned by a guy at the airport that I should\
  \ be wary of them as they used to take advantage of young girls. He then, looking\
  \ at me closer said I should be alright. I wasn't that young. So my driver asked\
  \ for 200 bahts, I offered 100 and we settled on 150. I felt accomplished. I was\
  \ happy, fulfilled, so as he dropped me off at the train station I decided to pay\
  \ him the 200 he had asked for. I told him he was a good man and I was thankful\
  \ to him for his kindness. He leaned in to hug me. I was touched. I had heard about\
  \ thais' generosity and warm hearts but I hadn't expected to experience it this\
  \ quickly. I leaned in too and as I did, he quickly tried to peck me on the lips.\
  \ Having grown in the land where men try to steal pecks as a sport, I was quicker\
  \ and he missed. I laughed it off and walked away. Thais are cheeky too I thought\
  \ as I waited for my train."
