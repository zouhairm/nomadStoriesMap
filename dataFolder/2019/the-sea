Text: "It was a four hour drive. \n\nI found myself winding down the window as my\
  \ parents bickered at the front, talking about things that sound like a buzz to\
  \ my ears now. Their conversation is indistinct, insignificant because my eyes were\
  \ focused on something else. \n\nThe sea. \n\nWe were nearing the Indian Ocean.\
  \ I could see the blues that reflected off the light of the sun, the air that struck\
  \ my cheeks from the unwound window but I welcomed the feeling. The smell of the\
  \ sea - it was beautiful, fresh, salty. It was everything that I never had and everything\
  \ that I always wanted. \n\nI remember sitting on a plane miles atop the ocean and\
  \ watching it ripple into the dark night. I knew then that I was in love. But to\
  \ be so close to it now; it was different.\n\nBeing at the top of a lighthouse by\
  \ the sea gave me a different view of what life was like here. The horizon stretched\
  \ beyond my imagination and the waves fiercely clashed with each other but I knew,\
  \ I knew that somewhere out there, there was life and there was more than just still\
  \ water. I knew about the aquatic life and I knew about marine life. I knew about\
  \ all of it but what was this feeling?\n\nI lifted my face into the cold air. It\
  \ was 16 degrees and I pulled my coat closer to me. \n\nThe voice of our tour guide\
  \ was loud but to me, it was quiet. I could barely hear her because all I heard\
  \ were the waves. The cries of the wind. The flapping of the Australian flag that\
  \ sat nearby the lighthouse. The ticking of my watch as I warmed my hands with my\
  \ breath. \n\nI imagined myself flying because what was this feeling of what's beyond?\
  \ What is more precious than the whispers of the wind the echo in my ears or the\
  \ dancing of waves that garnered so much strength of the earth? \n\n\"Sophie?\"\
  \ My father pulled me out of my reverie and I look over to him holding out his phone\
  \ to me, my mother by his side. \n\nMy hands shook as I took his phone and took\
  \ the picture. \n\nIt wasn't the height that always gave me nightmares or the thought\
  \ of the sea plunging below darkness that I cannot begin to fathom. It was the jitters\
  \ of excitement that filled me. It was the europhia that came along with being one\
  \ with the sea that I fell in love with. The dark ripples at night that went beyond\
  \ my imagination. The slight curve of my lips as I stared out into the ocean, seeing\
  \ the sparkles that glinted unmissed by my eyes. \n\n\"So do you like the place?\"\
  \n\nI  blink and focus back on my father who is staring at me expectantly. I already\
  \ know what he's thinking and he knows what I'm thinking. We share the same thoughts\
  \ of most things and this is no different. \n\nThe smell of the sea fills my nostrils\
  \ as I breathe deeply, bathing in the soft sun, listening to the crash of the waves,\
  \ closing my eyes as I tilt my head back.\n\nWith a small smile, I return his own.\
  \ \n\n\"I love it.\""
