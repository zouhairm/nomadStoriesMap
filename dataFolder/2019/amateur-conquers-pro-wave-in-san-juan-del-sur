Text: "Back arched, paddling with all my might, the only thing left was to commit.\
  \ The approaching wave had my entire focus except for a smidgen that went to shouts\
  \ of \"Dale, Dale\". Down the face of the wave I rode. Ions from the ocean spray\
  \ charging my core. I was up, turning, and floating towards shore.\n\nSpanish for\
  \ 'Giver!', dale was a gift from Anders, the local surf coach at Rapture. A week\
  \ earlier, riding a wave at Playa Yankee was inconceivable. But the entire week\
  \ he pushed to make a better surfer out of me.\n\nHe insisted I watch the film Surfs\
  \ Up. Unknown to him, my totem animal is a penguin. The message was clear; enjoyment\
  \ comes from all the morsels you pick up on the route. It's not about what the end\
  \ looks like. Bits of progress, shared with others at the camp, upped surfing's\
  \ pleasure in a dramatic way. \n\nIn search of a low-key camp, I decided on them.\
  \ Twenty minutes outside SJDS, high above jungle and beach, Rapture is perfect.\
  \ They offer both private and dorm beds, good for different budgets. Included in\
  \ the price are transport to surf beaches, breakfasts, and dinners. Lessons and\
  \ board rentals are extra, as some people bring their own quiver.\n\nI bought a\
  \ Funboard from a local shaper in SJDS before the camp. Over the years this type\
  \ of board became a personal preference. If a board is too long, it's hard to get\
  \ out past the break. If it's too short, there's an exponential rise in difficulty.\
  \ Following the guides lead, I named it 'Novio', Spanish for boyfriend.\n\nAfter\
  \ hanging with my Boyfriend in the sunshine, a cold beer in the pool rewarded the\
  \ day's effort. Add new friends from around the globe, one word best describes the\
  \ experience - delicious.\n\nSurfing is an activity rising in popularity. Missing\
  \ in the discussion is how hard the learning curve is. If getting a BA is like most\
  \ activities, surfing is comparable to obtaining a PhD.\n\nSince 2010, my journey\
  \ has included peaks and troughs. The first six years often fell in the latter.\
  \ Sporadic lessons resulted in incremental gains. It dawned on me after a bad surf\
  \ trip what the missing ingredient was. To develop the skills needed, a camp was\
  \ essential. Spending a week or more with the same instructor has many benefits.\
  \ Among them are consistent coaching, quicker advancement, and outside perspectives.\n\
  \nOthers see what you don't. An embarrassing example occurred on a past trip to\
  \ Nicaragua. I'd signed up for a class as a refresher. After a handful of attempts,\
  \ the guide said something that still makes me blush.\n\nHe said \"Every time you\
  \ stand, you plug your nose. Your brain has already decided you're going to bail.\"\
  \ There's no way I would have spotted this alone.\n\nChoosing this place, instead\
  \ of more familiar high-price ones, we discovered the unexpected. They took us to\
  \ beaches in the area including Playas Maderas, Hermosa, and Remanso. Huddling together\
  \ in the back of a pickup, our rides passed in laughter, music, and good chats.\
  \ This added stoke to already remarkable white-sand beaches.\n\nThe instructors\
  \ surprised us with the decision to go to Playa Yankees. This wave is for experts\
  \ with fast and powerful barrels. We trusted their choice, but with apprehension.\
  \ It didn't look like much when we arrived, but even the tiniest swell had power.\
  \ \n\nIn truth, it took twice as long to get in the water than other days. Adjusting\
  \ my bikini nonstop, clenching my board, I kept going out. Until catching up with\
  \ Anders in the lineup, images of my limp body on the rocks filled every thought.\n\
  \nOnce out, a look and a smile for Anders let me know the next wave had my name\
  \ engraved on it. Believing I was a champ, I paddled like one.\n\nGosh, darn were\
  \ we lucky that day; a one-foot swell on an otherwise expert-only break. Made for\
  \ the wave of my life!"
