Text: "I did not come to explore the island; I was escaping broken dreams and unfulfilled\
  \ desires. Nothing worked as I wished: love, relationships, career, finance. The\
  \ aching heart longed to forget my failures. I applied for a job not expecting a\
  \ response. It suddenly came and a Skype interview was scheduled for my birthday.\
  \ It felt like a sign: this time, it could work out. It did. I got the job away\
  \ from everybody I knew. I have never been to there: a summer holiday destination\
  \ for many, bright sunny postcards with turquoise waters. What did I know about\
  \ it: a dot in the Mediterranean Sea, right in the middle, between Europe and Africa,\
  \ densely populated, one of the smallest countries in the world? For centuries,\
  \ nations were coming there, invading, conquering, and using it as an outpost, a\
  \ navel base for their trade and sea exploration. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans,\
  \ Greeks, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Sicilians, Spanish, French, and British, all\
  \ left their cultural mark on that archipelago of coralline limestone, and echo\
  \ in that Semitic language blended with English, Italian, and Sicilian. \nI arrived\
  \ in October. It was balmy and the sun was tenderly warming my skin. The humid air\
  \ filled my nose, seeped through my pores deep inside me. I could finally breath.\
  \ Wondering later through history, I got lost in time and space, standing in front\
  \ of the Neolithic stone temples, Hagar Qim and Mnajdra, facing west coast winds,\
  \ or strolling through narrow paved medieval streets of fortified Silent City of\
  \ Mdina in dim lights after the dawn. Catholic churches as Saint John Cathedral\
  \ in Valletta confused me with their arabesques: were they places of worship for\
  \ Christians or Muslims? I passed sites with onion domes and minarets. Was it the\
  \ Turkish Military Cemetery in Marsa that bewildered me to feel like in the Middle\
  \ East?  \nI was working there 10-14 hours per day, going to the detention centre\
  \ that reminded zoo cages where behind long iron bars innocent people were still\
  \ keeping their dignity, or to open centres, where some arrived recently with hopes\
  \ after their harsh journey to finally get a chance, while others already lost their\
  \ dreams and themselves, in time and space but not the same way as me. That sad\
  \ struggle was unfair. We all search better lives: I took a plane, they took a boat,\
  \ and luck divided us. Those who could not cope any longer were sent to Mount Carmel\
  \ Hospital. Once beautiful building in the British neoclassical style with a tranquil\
  \ garden in front of it was now in a shabby and neglected state, falling to pieces\
  \ as a perfect metaphor for those, who were locked inside by the merciless irony\
  \ of life: they asked asylum as refugees running away from violence only to get\
  \ into asylum for the mentally ill.\nDuring weekends, I was watching waves breaking\
  \ rough against rocky shores in front of Fort Saint Elmo in Valletta or Fort Tigne\
  \ in Sliema. This raging force of nature was bringing my mind by its powerful sounds\
  \ to eternal questions of human existence, so small and fragile, how unnoticeably\
  \ short we are here fighting our lost battles against infinity. I was hiking through\
  \ Dingly cliffs with my breath taken away by the incredible sunsets I enjoyed alone\
  \ about 250 metres above the sea. I was attracted to the secluded beaches of Gnejna\
  \ Bay by their extraterrestrial landscapes. I felt free and finally having a peace\
  \ with my restless soul.\nThese memories of Malta - the berserk street religious\
  \ festivities in the dark hours; the fireworks flashing on the black sky each summer\
  \ night; the smokes from barbeques along the coast line; the excitement bringing\
  \ the entire nation to outside celebrate election victory or loss, cars and trucks\
  \ of people with flags, gardens on fire, making me wonder whether I was in a rebel\
  \ controlled area somewhere in Africa; the blast that took away the life of Daphne\
  \ Caruana Galizia, and the memorial sprouting up on the plinth of the Great Siege\
  \ Monument in Valletta, demanding justice for the anti-corruption journalist, -\
  \ these memories, they haunt me now, when I am away. I miss the strength that I\
  \ found there."
