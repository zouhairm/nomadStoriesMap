Text: "I enjoyed excellent whether in Vietnam, except for that one typhoon.\n\nThe\
  \ rain had only just begun as I boarded the sleeper in Ho Chi Minh City and immediately\
  \ fell asleep, exhausted from a week on the road. Several times through the night\
  \ I stirred just long enough to notice that the train was stopping and starting\
  \ before dozing off again.\n\nBy morning Typhoon Damrey had swept through ahead\
  \ of us, devastating entire villages. According to Al Jazeera, Damrey was the worst\
  \ typhoon to hit Vietnam in 16 years and the final death toll reached 151 across\
  \ Vietnam and neighbouring Cambodia.\n\nIn my six-berth compartment I reclined at\
  \ an awkward angle, unable to sit upright without hitting my head on the ceiling\
  \ while watching movies on my phone, completely oblivious.\n\nThe only English announcements\
  \ featured a woman\u2019s pre-recorded voice pleasantly apologising for the delay.\
  \ We were a few hours late but I wasn\u2019t concerned, TripAdvisor led me to believe\
  \ that this wasn\u2019t unusual for South-East Asian trains. TripAdvisor was wrong.\n\
  \nWe pulled into Nha Trang and a Vietnamese announcement had everyone in my compartment\
  \ frowning and muttering nervously before half grabbed their belongings and left.\
  \ They weren\u2019t alone and it had seemed odd that so many departed at once, but\
  \ it was a main stop on the route north so I still didn\u2019t think much of it\
  \ at the time.\n\nHowever, after more hours of repeated stopping and starting before\
  \ stopping again, I watched the conductor gesture urgently as he spoke with the\
  \ couple in my compartment and my stomach churned with the belated realisation that\
  \ something must actually be very, very wrong.\n\nIt became especially clear when\
  \ they fell silent and turned to me in unison. I may not speak Vietnamese but I\
  \ understood those exasperated looks: how the hell do we tell her?\n\nI clambered\
  \ down from the top bunk for an interesting game of pictionary which explained that\
  \ we must catch a bus to another train and led me to assume that we\u2019d broken\
  \ down.\n\n\u201CDa Nang and Hoi An?\u201D I asked, pointing to their rough sketch\
  \ of the second train. They nodded. If we were all headed in the same direction\
  \ we\u2019d get there eventually, so why worry?\n\nLate into the afternoon, still\
  \ waiting to evacuate, I heard the word \u201Ctyphoon\u201D from a group of lovely\
  \ American women and learned exactly why I should worry. The only English speakers\
  \ I\u2019d encountered in days explained that debris had made long stretches of\
  \ track impassable so we\u2019d stopped to clear the way to the next station where\
  \ we could bypass the wreckage on buses.\n\nFor the first time I was gripped by\
  \ raw panic, imagining my mother seeing the words \u201Cdeadly typhoon\u201D on\
  \ the news back home with no way to contact me and I resolved to never again travel\
  \ without mobile data. Thankfully these women hadn\u2019t made the same mistake\
  \ and let me send a quick message on one of their phones before Mum could contact\
  \ an embassy or seven.\n\nThey invited me to join them in the dining car where we\
  \ squished into the last available booth and traded stories of our travels, balancing\
  \ golden cans of Ha Noi beer on the rickety wooden bench. It turns out time moves\
  \ much faster when you know what\u2019s going on. Inebriation and the ability to\
  \ speak with those around you helps too.\n\nWe finally arrived at 3am. We\u2019\
  d been trapped on that train with stale air and cramped limbs for over 30 hours.\n\
  \nIn Hoi An my \u201Cfield view\u201D room was upgraded to a water view as I looked\
  \ out over a murky brown floodplain. After scrolling through dramatic headlines\
  \ proclaiming the historic village a no-go zone, I found myself in a bustling town\
  \ that insisted on Business As Usual right up to the edge of the flood. I passed\
  \ shopkeepers beckoning me in even as they swept water out with a broom.\n\nI maneuvered\
  \ puddles and cracked pavement with delightfully aching legs, simply thrilled to\
  \ stretch and breathe deep. The breeze was cool and fresh. It stirred the paper\
  \ lanterns strung overhead, red gems against a blue sky. The sun was out again."
