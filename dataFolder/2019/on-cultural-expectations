Text: "Let\u2019s start with a little bit of context. I\u2019m a guy from Timi\u0219\
  oara (which is a city in Romania [which is a country in Eastern Europe {which used\
  \ to be behind the Iron Curtain}]). \n\nI\u2019m a lazy person, and I don\u2019\
  t travel much. But I do like travel stories! So\u2026 where does one turn when they\
  \ like travel stories? To other travelers, of course. And the easiest way to get\
  \ genuine, interesting tales is to host the travelers themselves. In other words,\
  \ I became a Couchsurfing host.\n\nOver time I\u2019ve had my share of guests, some\
  \ boring as deadwood, some too lively for my taste. Today I will talk to you about\
  \ M., a 25-years old student from Germany. Or, at least that\u2019s what the profile\
  \ said. She was in Germany on a scholarship; her home country was Palestine, and\
  \ yes, this will be relevant later :)\n\nNow, this Couchsurfing thing is supposed\
  \ to be a cultural exchange. We Romanians pride ourselves on having good food, so\
  \ in due time M. became acquainted with polenta, topped with (really fat) sour cream,\
  \ plus home-made sausages, plus other foodstuffs that I shall not mention for fear\
  \ of turning into G.R.R. Martin.\n\nOnce properly fed, I took her to visit the town.\
  \ One local attraction is this quaint, weird bar near the town center: Sc\xEEr\u021B\
  \ Loc Lejer. They have weird decorations, they play weird music, in short it\u2019\
  s heaven for hipsters and the local artsy population alike. On top of that, they\
  \ also play host to a museum!\n\nIt is pompously called \u201C(The) Communist Consumer\
  \ Museum\u201D, despite it being just a collection of items from the communist era\
  \ in Romania. Maybe you have seen rotary disks in movies. Well, Romania had exactly\
  \ ONE state-mandated model, to be seen in every home regardless of social status,\
  \ income or rank in the Party.\n\nTwo rooms chock-full of items that were mostly\
  \ imposed by the state. Two variations of radio devices, one vinyl disk player,\
  \ a fair sample of children\u2019s toys\u2026 oh yes, and of course a \u201CPegas\u201D\
  \ bike, the local pride. \n\nI like this place due to the reactions it elicits from\
  \ my visitors. Most of them have never had any contact with the life behind the\
  \ Iron Curtain, and they end up slightly shocked to learn how \u2026 dull and dreary\
  \ things could be, and how culturally repetitive and limited things were. They do\
  \ get cheered up by the collection of postcards, which are quite diverse and actually\
  \ do show a colorful life; just to be let down again by the kitschy \u201Cglass\
  \ fish\u201D decoration that used to be a staple ornament on every local television\
  \ set.\n\nHowever, my subject (M.)\u2026 she kept looking around with a mild smile.\
  \ Instead of cultural shock, M. is displaying an almost dreamy face. Finally, I\
  \ muster up the courage to ask what\u2019s going on, and she explains simply: this\
  \ time-capsule is taking her back to her home country. It is stirring up memories!\n\
  \nWhat, Palestine? Why, yes, Palestine, a place that has been trading bombs instead\
  \ of sweets with its neighbor. Palestine, the place where the \u201Ccommunist\u201D\
  \ kitchen tools that are on display here, would find a place of honor in an actual\
  \ kitchen. I\u2019m told that yes, *this* exact model of manual meat grinder is\
  \ still in use; who could afford kitchen mixers and other electric tools? The solid\
  \ wood wardrobe is similar to what her neighbors used to have. Piece by piece, she\
  \ touches another item that reminds her of home.\n\nWhen we descended in the museum,\
  \ I had expected to be the one schooling her. Instead, it is me that is getting\
  \ schooled!\n\nTurns out, waging a war with your neighbor for years and years will\
  \ leave a subtle mark on the economy and on the people. Or, as M. put \u2026\n\n\
  - What do you guys do, how do you survive with the constant threat of getting bombed\
  \ tomorrow?\n\n- We just keep going, day after day. You grow used to constant war.\
  \ You live around it.\n\nI guess there\u2019s something to take away from this,\
  \ but I am not sure yet how to put things into words\u2026"
