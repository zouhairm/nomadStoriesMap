Text: "We find ourselves at a crossroad, wondering which path will lead us till where\
  \ we want to go. After driving 30 minutes down a narrow and windy gravel road, we\
  \ had to stop the car, not being able to drive over the massive hole that took up\
  \ most of the road. So the car was left there and we continued on by foot without\
  \ knowing how far down the gravel road we would have to walk, before getting to\
  \ the actual trail we had set out to discover. Only thing we knew at this point\
  \ was that there would be a cave hiding somewhere among the cliffs and the forest\
  \ here on the West Coast of New Zealand. \n\nLuckily, after having walked a few\
  \ kilometres down the road, we encountered something else than nature - two local\
  \ cyclists. They stopped a few metres in front of us and turned around both with\
  \ a kind smile.  \n\u201CDo you two know where you are going?\u201D the man asked\
  \ us. That we did know, just not how to get there. \nThen we were stood at the crossroads\
  \ a little later, we tried to remember which way the man had told us to take. Discussing\
  \ backwards and forwards if it would be here we were meant to turn right, we ended\
  \ up doing it, only to discover this couldn\u2019t be the way and we went back to\
  \ the crossroads to continue straight ahead. Finally we saw a sign and now knew\
  \ in which direction we were going. At the sign we had to turn right. We were led\
  \ through the forest, where all the bugs were buzzing around us and the birds singing\
  \ songs, I have never heard of before. The trail itself wasn't anything special,\
  \ but what awaited us at the end was. Exactly what I had expected, I do not know,\
  \ other than I knew there would be a cave. Down some stairs we went and I found\
  \ myself in a place I had never expected to be. Here, in what felt like the middle\
  \ of nowhere, a magic place had appeared. We were like elves in Middle-earth - although\
  \ not looking like ones with hiking boots, a cap and a rucksack. Above the valley\
  \ the trees were standing, almost as guards, and beneath them laid the big rocks\
  \ covered in green moss with a small river running through. With an overwhelmed\
  \ grin on both our faces, we looked at each other not really knowing what to say.\
  \ It felt like something from our childhood, although a place we had never visited\
  \ other than in our dreams. In the background was the cave, and old trees that had\
  \ fallen down the slope, now covered in moss, were laying before it. Everything\
  \ was adding to the fairytale we were standing in, from the mysterious cave to the\
  \ sun that was shining down through the trees and glistening in the river. Jumping\
  \ from one big rock to another, balancing on tree locks, and swimming naked in the\
  \ clear water, we were kids again. Time wasn\u2019t a worry here, and in many ways\
  \ I felt like, we had stepped into an unknown world then we walked down the many\
  \ stairs, and I almost feared a bad villain would come anytime and break the fairytale.\
  \ But there must not be a lot of people disturbing the nature around here, because\
  \ on the trail on our way back to the real world, we met a bird, who wasn\u2019\
  t afraid of us at all. It was following us and flew closer and closer, until we\
  \ noticed it and we stood still. I sat down and looked at it, and it looked at me\
  \ - like it didn\u2019t knew people. Intrigued, it jumped closer, without any fear,\
  \ and didn\u2019t even fly away, was I to accidentally make a sudden movement. It\
  \ felt like magic was following us, and soon we would have to step back into the\
  \ real world."
