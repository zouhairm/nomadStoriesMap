  \ I say, and I point to another animal. \u201CCat,\u201D he says after a moment.\
  \ Correct again. I flip the page and point to another animal. He takes the book\
  \ from my hand and brings it to his face, and then he smiles and points. \u201C\
  Dinosaur!\u201D he yells confidently. Incorrect; it is a butterfly.\n\nBut he already\
  \ knows that. Before I can correct him laughs and scurries away from me. He skips\
  \ around the kitchen and sings \u201Cbutterfly, dinosaur, butterfly, dinosaur\u201D\
  . Ming, his mother, and I laugh. I have been teaching Sheng English for four months\
  \ now. It is enough of a challenge to keep up with the energy of a four year old,\
  \ but it is another challenge entirely to do it Thailand\u2019s heat.\n\nNonetheless,\
  \ I was proud of our progress together. Sheng picked up the English language quickly;\
  \ especially considering English is his third language. I tell this to Ming now,\
  \ and she nods in agreement. \u201CSometimes though,\u201D she says, \u201CI still\
  \ worry. What will become of my son?\u201D\n\nI stand from my seat at the kitchen\
  \ table to go wash my hands so we can begin making dinner. Ming and I\u2019s conversations\
  \ were usually light and funny. But tonight is my last night in Thailand, and we\
  \ are both being more serious.\n\nWhat will become of this boy? This boy who is\
  \ raised by his Chinese mother in a small Thai village. This boy who speaks fluent\
  \ Mandarin and loves to watch Spiderman cartoons. This boy who has trouble communicating\
  \ with his classmates, who sees his father sparingly because he is away in China\
  \ earning his PhD.  \n\nWill he face the prejudice that many Chinese people face\
  \ when they live in Thailand? Will he be labeled as an annoying tourist or even\
  \ an immigrant despite the fact that Thailand is his birth country? In his lifetime\
  \ will the Myanmar Rohingya Crisis spread into Thailand as thousands seek refuge?\
  \ Will he be able to live in China or the United States without facing discrimination?\
  \ \n\nMing listens to me while mixing spices together. She says these are \u201C\
  young American\u201D questions. They are questions that reflect my upbringing in\
  \ a country that claims to welcome diversity but discourages it by design. \n\n\
  Ming has her \u201CChinese mother\u201D questions, as she calls them. She wonders\
  \ if Sheng is receiving a good education. What would his father think if he became\
  \ a Thai \u201Clady boy\u201D? What would she think of it? She\u2019s not opposed\
  \ to tattoos, but would his Chinese grandmother approve? Would it matter by then?\
  \ These are the questions from her upbringing, from the love for her son. But still,\
  \ the matter remains: what will become of him?\n\nI pick up another little circle\
  \ of dough and plop a ball of minced meat in the center of it. Tonight\u2019s dinner\
  \ is also a cooking lesson: Ming is teaching me how to make dumplings so I can make\
  \ them at home for my family. There is a very obvious and laughable difference between\
  \ her dumplings and mine as they sit on lettuce leafs waiting to be steamed. \n\n\
  I ask Ming what Sheng wants to do when he grows up. She tells me on some days he\
  \ wants to be a teacher, some days a pilot. \u201CMost days,\u201D she says giggling,\
  \ \u201Che wants to be a dinosaur.\u201D \n\nSheng runs back into the kitchen when\
  \ he hears the word dinosaur and roars loudly. Ming smiles at him, the universal\
  \ smile mothers save especially for their child.\n\nLater in the evening the rest\
  \ of our friends arrive, each of them receiving a big hug from Sheng along with\
  \ an introduction to his latest toy. We sit on the floor around a small table and\
  \ eagerly dive into the spread of dishes that we prepared for each other.\n\nSheng\
  \ moves happily from lap to lap, switching between Mandarin, English, and Thai as\
  \ he goes. I watch him laugh with the adults, and I exchange a look with Ming. We\
  \ have no business worrying about the future. What will become of this boy will\
  \ be no greater than the love he has in the present."
