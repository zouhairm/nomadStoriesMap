Text: "Mexico came to me in a dream. I was asleep, dreaming of a beautiful kitchen\
  \ with gorgeous blue ceramic\n tiles with sunflowers on them. It was ine if thise\
  \ dreams that was very vivid, every detail was seen. The kitchen had gorgeous counters.\
  \ I remember wishing I had a kitchen like this. When I woke, I turned on the television\
  \ as if I was looking for something. And I come to the tail end of an Andrew Zimmern\
  \ program where in the rolling credits showed he was in Mexico. I wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ but I thought \u201Ccooking school\u201D and the next day looked up online and\
  \ found a cooking school in Oaxaca Mexico that Andrew apparently may have been at.\
  \ \n\nI found a tour package called the Dia de los Muertos from the school, a ten\
  \ day excursion and cooking experience and emailed the school. They wrote back they\
  \ were booked. I thought oh well. \n\nThen got another email saying someone dropped\
  \ out last minute would I still be interested.  I went and had the most unbelievable\
  \ time checking our markets, cemeteries, going to the mountains where people opened\
  \ their doors and we ate drank and danced in the candlelight, music and stars. When\
  \ I saw the school kitchen where we would be learning to make certain Mexican dishes,\
  \ I gasped. The same kitchen in my dreams was the very same kitchen I ws walking\
  \ into, down to the beautiful sunfliwer blue ceramic tile!  I also said the kitchen\
  \ looked like it was expanded and explained the area where and the owner said chills\
  \ raised the hairs on her neck when she explained that indeed the litchen had changed\
  \ but that information was not known to evwrybody just to the owner. She told me\
  \ I was meant to be there.   \nSo I take my cues from the universe seriously. When\
  \ I came across this, I had to write and enter. \nLook forward to my next traveling\
  \ adventure!"
