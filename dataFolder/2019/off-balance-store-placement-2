Text: "Butcher shop right next to an evening gown store. Dina, my 22-year-old host,\
  \ isn\u2019t fazed by the unusual proximity of the two stores as we are walking\
  \ the streets of Pristina, the least visited capital city in Europe. It\u2019s a\
  \ balmy November afternoon, Kosovo just celebrated its neighbor, Albania\u2019s\
  \ Independence Day and now Christmas stalls are being set up. Pristina does not\
  \ have abundance of cultural relics but has the remnants of a modern-day Istanbul.\
  \ Taupe colored low-rise buildings, hodge-podge of electrical wires and blend of\
  \ Eastern and Western values. At first glance it may seem deceptively dull, but\
  \ as strange as it sounds the city\u2019s idiosyncratic charm has a lot to do with\
  \ its resilient past.\n\nAs we are having \u20AC1.5 hamburgers which are not really\
  \ hamburgers but halal beef burgers, Dina tells me that she hopes to be a diplomat\
  \ one day. The good work UN has been doing in Kosovo seem worth the hustle of juggling\
  \ two jobs and a master\u2019s degree. Her unbridled optimism leaning on the side\
  \ of irrational exuberance is contagious. As we walk by the Bill Clinton statue,\
  \ she quickly points out that the Hilary Clinton pantsuit shop is nearby. It might\
  \ help her career aspirations.  I am starting to believe maybe a red pant suit will\
  \ charm my potential employers too. \n\nDina asked me, \u201CDo you know Rita Ora?\
  \ She was born here but then moved to UK.\u201D \n\nI am glad the topic of discussion\
  \ is pop culture. It\u2019s been a lot to process in the past few days. Probably,\
  \ the first Pakistani passport the immigration officials have seen. All but my last\
  \ name is baffling for them. \n\n\u201CWe know Hassan. Muslim name. First name never\
  \ aarrd.\u201D, said the Security Personnel in his thick Albanian accent.  \n\n\
  96% of the population is Muslim in Kosovo, unlike my homeland, it is secular in\
  \ nature. Their independence struggle is another story. Once a part of Federal Republic\
  \ of Yugoslavia, Kosovo was the last central Balkan state to gain independence.\
  \ In mid-1998, a full-fledged war broke out between Kosovo Liberation Army and Serbian\
  \ Army, which led to thousands being killed and millions displaced. Deemed as ethnic\
  \ cleansing of Albanian Muslims in the region, UN and NATO\u2019s intervention halted\
  \ the attacks but the road to being recognized as an independent nation took another\
  \ nine years. Economic autonomy is another contentious issue as it is heavily reliant\
  \ on foreign aid. \n\nThe sense of displacement permeates long after freedom has\
  \ been achieved. Dina is one of the fortunate few who had the opportunity to escape\
  \ to Albania with her family during the height of war but soon came back to a town\
  \ of obliterated homes and local businesses with their shutters down. Inhaling the\
  \ smog filled air, her voice breaks as she reflects on the struggles her family\
  \ had to overcome and how she is grateful for what she has now, a violence-free\
  \ life. \n\nTo build the town from ground up, the off-balance store placement, in\
  \ fact off-balance lifestyle makes sense. An ecommerce food startup next to a 50\
  \ square foot donor kebab restaurant. A mosque calling to prayer next to a nightclub\
  \ with lack of exit doors. Young girls in leather jackets accompanying their grandmothers\
  \ in headscarves. How can it be any other way?\n\nPristina has made me realize that\
  \ so much of my life I have spent compartmentalizing my thoughts and actions. As\
  \ a Pakistani living in US, how much do I adapt to my new environment versus hold\
  \ onto my longstanding beliefs? A modern citizen of an interconnected world? A conservative?\
  \ An imposter? I don\u2019t necessarily need my past or present situation to confine\
  \ me but to be grateful for the experiences that allow me to grow. \n\nMost of all\
  \ Pristina has taught me that harmony sometimes lies in absurdity. Dina and I are\
  \ now off to Mother Teresa Square to devour some gelatos."
