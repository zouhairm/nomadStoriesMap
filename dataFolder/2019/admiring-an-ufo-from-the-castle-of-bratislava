Text: "What price can a city pay to see a UFO flying on the horizon every day?\nYou\
  \ should ask about it in Bratislava where people enjoys the SNP Bridge - named after\
  \ the Slovak National Insurrection - since 1972, the most absurd and imposing of\
  \ structures that stand above the Danube. Forget Wien, Budapest or Belgrade: it\
  \ is the bridge of the secluded, modest Slovak capital to steal the scene on the\
  \ second longest river in Europe.\n\nAt one of its ends, supported by two imposing\
  \ pillars, here is UFO, the restaurant shaped like a spaceship that overlooks Bratislava,\
  \ the city of which it has become, imposing itself, the new symbol, the modern one.\
  \ Ironically, just from what was the old symbol of the capital, the bridge and the\
  \ tower are best enjoyed: the immaculate and austere castle, a building that seems\
  \ to follow you while walking from the city, nothing can stand against the strength\
  \ of a regime, the Soviet one, that anything would have done to show that yes, even\
  \ in Czechoslovakia, there was no question about its mightiness.\n\nTo build this\
  \ strange structure, it did not matter back then that the St. Martin Cathedral had\
  \ to be obscured by the road that begins to rise, becoming the SNP Bridge, and flies\
  \ over the Danube. What did it matter that there, for centuries, one Hungarian ruler\
  \ was crowned after another? Its foundations tremble when traffic fills the little\
  \ lanes in front of it. \nSame goes for the Jewish quarter of Bratislava - wiped\
  \ off by the regime without any thoughts - and, of course, a part of the medieval\
  \ walls, the link between the city and its heart: that very castle that today, from\
  \ afar, envies and bends its head in front of its cannibal successor of reinforced\
  \ concrete. \n\nAfter having climbed a thousands steps to get there, you can really\
  \ sense how time switches the way things are perceived by us, tiny and passing spectators:\
  \ a UFO reigning a flat landscape on the left, countless windmill blades on the\
  \ right, looking like menacing soldiers of Modern Times ready this powerless a out\
  \ of time banner the finishing blow. \nI hope that never happens."
