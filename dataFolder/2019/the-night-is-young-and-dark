Text: "It's June 2016. We are buffeted by the cold winter air as we emerge from the\
  \ restaurant. We make our way down Kelly\u2019s dark and empty steps and into the\
  \ bustling crowds that have lined Salamanca Place. The \u2018we\u2019 in question\
  \ is my mother and I. It is the first time we are travelling together since I had\
  \ fled the nest. We travelled south to Hobart under the guise of re-establishing\
  \ our relationship, but it would untimely be the catalyst for its end. \n\nHobart\
  \ is a city in the same way what I have with my mother is a relationship. The word\
  \ is claimed on a technicality and maintained it out of convenience for others.\
  \ According to Google Maps, it would take the average able-bodied adult a mere 4\
  \ hours and 46 minutes to walk from the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, down\
  \ by the tall masts that line the city\u2019s docks, through the famous Salamanca\
  \ Market and then scale the looming peak of Mt Wellington.\n\nIn contrast to its\
  \ physical size, the city has a monumental history. Not only acting as the launching\
  \ point for one of man\u2019s greatest adventures, the traversing of the Antarctic,\
  \ but also the setting to some of Australia\u2019s darkest histories, a genocide\
  \ so horribly effective that it inspired HG Wells to terrorise the British public\
  \ with his War of the Worlds. \n\nIt makes a fitting capital for the state of Tasmania.\
  \ Running conservative from conception, Tasmania functioned as a penal colony in\
  \ its infancy; the aftermath of which can still be toured at Port Arthur. The same\
  \ tourist destination saw the massacre that would be the final push for national\
  \ gun reform in 1996. And, the titbit of Tasmanian history that I had always found\
  \ the most personally disturbing, in 1997 it was the last state in Australia to\
  \ decriminalise homosexuality, just three years after I was born. \n\nWhile the\
  \ political face of the state has slowly changed, this is a history that demands\
  \ to be recognised. A history as ever-present as the cold wind that bites your cheeks\
  \ as you peruse the artisan wares displayed in Salamanca Market, every item perfectly\
  \ designed for their white middle-class target market. It seeps through the windows\
  \ of the Indigenous art gallery you are guided through by a white-skinned curator.\
  \ It battles with the warmth of the mulled cider you sip while snuggled into a booth\
  \ of a British style pub located in the centre of Hobart\u2019s nightlife. The city\
  \ we know as Hobart was founded on white, traditional values. But that night the\
  \ city was dark.  \n\nI had been lured into this mother-daughter trip with a promise\
  \ of visiting the Museum of Old and New Art (MONA). I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ that, as night fell on the city, the MONA would come to us. We had serendipitously\
  \ arrived in time for Dark Mofo, a yearly festival which takes the spirit of MONA\
  \ twenty-five minutes down the river and pours it onto the streets of Hobart. \n\
  \nAs my mother briskly leads me through the crowds, fresh new art emerges before\
  \ us. Spotlights carve lines through the overcast sky; the streets teem with tourists\
  \ and local\u2019s alike and rapidly growing queues reveal installations hidden\
  \ in the century-old brick basements. In front of our hotel, a giant inflatable\
  \ rabbit glows bright attracting crowds of amateur artist\u2019s intent on creating\
  \ self-portraits of their own. It is not yet eight PM and the night is young. \n\
  \nMy mother trudges on to our hotel room, ignoring my dragging feet. She flicks\
  \ the TV to some 80\u2019s b-movie as she grumpily climbs into bed. Without a word,\
  \ she turns off the light. The flickering of the TV is all that illuminates the\
  \ room. \n\nIt takes me a while to work up the courage, but the distant sounds of\
  \ excitement finally make me more intrigued than afraid. For the first time in my\
  \ life, something new conquers old. I grab the room key and head to the door. My\
  \ hair is blown off my face as I step into the night alone. The wind is cold but\
  \ the crowd is bustling."
