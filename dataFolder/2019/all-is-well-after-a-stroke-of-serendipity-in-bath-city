Text: "The soundtrack to the start of my solo trip was the click-clacking of shoes\
  \ at Paddington Station. I was visiting Somerset, head filled with a mish-mash of\
  \ plans and itineraries. Among them: see Pulteney Bridge in Bath, one of the few\
  \ in the world with shops built into it; take in the view from Bath Cathedral; immerse\
  \ in the undulating landscapes and history of Cheddar Gorge. The weekend was primed\
  \ for adventure and the air tinged with the promise of new discoveries.\n\nAt a\
  \ bus stop in Bath city centre, I met Jay who helped me with some directions. She\
  \ was a complete stranger, but we found affinity in our shared African roots within\
  \ minutes. Her Uganda to my Ghana. I remember the sun glistening on her dark skin\
  \ and the shifting light casting shadows on her face as she fidgeted. Something\
  \ seemed to be gnawing at her. \n\nFinally she blurted, \u201CMy daughter wants\
  \ to do a gap year instead of going straight to university. My sister, can you believe\
  \ it?\u201D\n\u201CWhat does she want to do?\u201D\n\u201CShe wants to travel. Thailand.\
  \ Cambodia. I don\u2019t even know the rest! Where did she get that idea? It\u2019\
  s not like us!\u201D\n\nJudging from the flecks of grey in her hair, she seemed\
  \ closer in age to an older aunt. Nevertheless, there was an immediate and familiar\
  \ bond in her use of \u201Cmy sister\u201D. We were two people of African extraction\
  \ who had both found new homes in Europe, thrown together by happenstance on a warm\
  \ August afternoon in Bath. Her reference to \u201Cus\u201D had not gone unnoticed,\
  \ either. Us, who? Us, Africans. I sensed her innate fear and hostility to the idea\
  \ of gap year travel. It was something considered to be the reserve of intrepid\
  \ young white people. Yet, here was her Westernised daughter, younger than I was,\
  \ nurturing dreams of seeing far-flung places that had been heard of but not sampled.\n\
  \nI understood Jay\u2019s concern in this vulnerable crossroad. However, from my\
  \ perspective as a young African navigating similar travel passions, sometimes to\
  \ the bewilderment of older generations, I also recognised my unique position in\
  \ the moment. Her daughter sounded like a kindred adventurer. So, I leaned forward\
  \ and spoke earnestly about the spirit of discovery in \u201Cus\u201D. We too look\
  \ at the horizon and wonder what\u2019s beyond; we are drawn to corners of the world\
  \ beyond the familiar. We want to embrace more of the people and places we allow\
  \ ourselves to experience. We do not have to rush to university just to tick that\
  \ box. Travelling is a positive time of learning for \u201Cus\u201D, too.  \n\n\u201C\
  Let her go,\u201D I finished gently. \u201CShe will return with a better perspective\
  \ of who she is, and how she\u2019ll carve a space for herself in the world.\u201D\
  \nHer mood was considerably lighter as she looked at me curiously. \u201CSo, do\
  \ you live and work here in Bath?\u201D \nI smiled my most winning smile. \u201C\
  No. I\u2019m just a traveller here. My sister.\u201D \n\nWe hurriedly exchanged\
  \ phone numbers as our respective buses arrived, promising to stay in touch. Sadly,\
  \ I lost Jay\u2019s number along with others\u2019 soon after during a phone repair\
  \ job. In the weeks and months that passed, I thought about that afternoon often.\
  \ Each time, I regretted not writing the number down in my notebook like the good\
  \ old days before technology took over almost all of our interactions.\n\nOne year\
  \ later I got a fateful phone call out of the blue. It was Jay. After much pressure\
  \ from her daughter to reconnect with the woman who had changed her mind, she sought\
  \ me out and told me my advice had been taken. In the end, the gap year experience\
  \ had taken her daughter back to her African roots. She had travelled around West\
  \ Africa, discovering more of the little-known continent she had ties to. Having\
  \ returned with new experiences, she had recently started a degree programme in\
  \ Law and Politics. I marvelled at how a serendipitous local encounter could reverberate\
  \ so powerfully! There was one thought playing in mind as I hang up the phone. \n\
  \nSometimes our travels pave the way for someone else to embark on theirs."
