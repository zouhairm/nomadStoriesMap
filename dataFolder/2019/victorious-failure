Text: "Sleep deprived, bleary eyed, and disoriented from altitude, I wake to put on\
  \ my five shirts, four layers of pants and socks, three sets of gloves, two hats\
  \ and strap on my headlamp, gaiters, and hiking boots.  It is midnight at Barafu\
  \ Hut, base camp, on Mount Kilimanjaro. After unzipping the tent flap, I am met\
  \ with placid, crisp air and peacefully falling snow, the kind that as a little\
  \ girl growing up in Michigan I always wanted to see fall on Christmas morning.\
  \ \n\nAs our guides prepare to take our team of four to summit, we drink hot ginger\
  \ tea and fill up on high calorie nutrition bars. While on the trail we pass other,\
  \ slower groups who already seem to be struggling while our group remained optimistic,\
  \ youthful, and strong. Unknowing that the next ten hours we would return with a\
  \ newfound respect for the mountain and the unrelenting, omnipotent Mother Nature.\
  \ \n\nAs we ascend, the air turns breezy, then windy. The snow transforms into tiny\
  \ hail, abusing the small amount of exposed skin on our faces. The trail disappears,\
  \ and any footprints from hikers before us are instantly covered by the snow, leaving\
  \ our guides to flex their navigational muscles to bring us to the distant summit.\
  \ The only time our team is not alone is when another hiker is being carried off\
  \ the mountain, heading back down to base camp, defeated.  Our optimism replaced\
  \ with doubt, our youth replaced with sheer exhaustion, and our strength replaced\
  \ with failing muscles. \n\nWe stop for a water break, clumsily removing our gloves\
  \ to access our buried liters of water in our backpacks. I reach in to find that\
  \ one of my bottles had spilled, ruining the journal I had been writing in since\
  \ arriving in Tanzania nine days earlier. The other has begun to freeze. I drink\
  \ what I can, knowing I will soon have start hoping for the charity of my mates.\
  \ Eventually my feet feel like 30 lb. dumbbells, lifting each one in and out of\
  \ the three feet of snow, sometimes more, depending on the boulders that lay beneath\
  \ and the direction of the wind. I start to dread having to stop to go to the bathroom,\
  \ as any exposed skin is subject to a slap from the bitter cold. One of my mates\
  \ completely runs out of energy, but carries on nonetheless. Another stop, a bit\
  \ more water, and we remember the caffeine pills that someone smartly brought along.\
  \ Every second during every stop our muscles get colder and the scene turning a\
  \ bit more perilous, forcing me to focus solely on putting one foot in front of\
  \ the other, transforming the trek into a meditation. Training my mind to dig to\
  \ the deepest depths of my physical strength to make it to the top. \n\nAt 8:30\
  \ AM we reach Stella Pointe, elevation 18,651 feet. The summit, but not the highest\
  \ point which is Uhuru Peak. We snap photos the best we can while fighting severe\
  \ nausea and exhaustion. The summit is not at all what the internet and travel blogs\
  \ depict: a serene sunrise, a few piles of snow, lots of smiles. Instead, we are\
  \ beneath a thick blanket of clouds, the wind threatening to blow us clear off the\
  \ summit, large drifts of snow in every direction. The scene eerie and otherworldly.\
  \ With Uhuru Peak less than a mile from where I stand, I have no choice but to accept\
  \ heartbreaking defeat while feeling an overwhelming pride and sense of accomplishment.\
  \ I am standing on top of one of the world\u2019s highest peaks. Deprived of oxygen\
  \ and energy, we turn back to base camp due to the safety concern of our lead guide.\n\
  \nWe utilize the mountain\u2019s face as a giant snow slide to descend, making our\
  \ way down on our rear ends, hoping to not snag a sharp volcanic rock. I walk off\
  \ the face of Kilimanjaro on my own two feet, an emotionless zombie. Looking forward\
  \ to a nap, I arrive to a collapsed tent, unable to bear the weight of the snow.\
  \ So I sit on a rock, remove my boots, and exhale."
