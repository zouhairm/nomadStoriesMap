Text: "As the plane took off, I felt high pressure on my neck. It was my first flight\
  \ and first trip into unknown places I\u2019ve never been before. I thought I was\
  \ going to die, and I blamed Hollywood for that. \nThere was a Turkish girl, Ozlem,\
  \ next to me. She had fair skin, long hair and blue eyes with nice smile. She tried\
  \ to calm me down with questions and asked about the purpose of my destination.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t a traveller but a student who always had dreams of seeing the world\
  \ and never had the chance. While Ozlem was talking about her travel experiences,\
  \ I was literally going to those places in my mind. I\u2019m not going to lie about\
  \ this because for a moment I fell for her blue eyes. And it was weird because a\
  \ moment away from home, I was already looking for love. Anyway! After 22 years,\
  \ it was my first time as a guest somewhere among strangers I know. \n\n Eight hours\
  \ of flight, and we finally landed in Bologna. There were some other students from\
  \ India, Czech Republic and Russia too that we got on the bus together. Ozlem waved\
  \ at me and wished me a good luck because she was leaving Bologna for Venice the\
  \ next day. And my destination was a small town in Tuscany province, Siena. \nRussian\
  \ friend of mine was constantly telling stories about Siena while I was watching\
  \ green hills and the signs on the road throw the window. On the half of the way,\
  \ an Italian got on the bus. His name was Francesco and after some short conversations\
  \ he mentioned that there will be a traditional horse racing, \u201CPalio\u201D\
  , this week. Palio is an annual competition among families in Siena. Even if he\
  \ didn\u2019t say, it was an easy guess that he was a member of one of those families.\
  \ You could sense his pride in the eyes while he was talking about how his family\
  \ horse would win.  Every family has their own flags and poems to tell and etc.\
  \ At first, I thought they are some kinds of mafia. Movies again! When I watched\
  \ \u201CPalio\u201D with Francesco, I realized that these people are too fun to\
  \ be mafia! \n I met an Azerbaijani friend of mine to take me to the dormitory when\
  \ I arrived in Siena. Narrow streets; among old buildings we passed throw. There\
  \ was history everywhere. Lamps on the walls were like in Harry Potter series. The\
  \ city was getting more mysterious a moment after moment. It has already been 5\
  \ months among strangers I know, and I made new home so far from home."
