Text: "Cold and unfriendly, that's what we felt when we first arrived in Hongkong.\
  \ We were presented with the scenery of hasty pedestrians who ignore their surroundings\
  \ as we were on our way to the hotel. It turns out our hotel is in a complex with\
  \ hundreds of shops and residents, thing we could not find in Indonesia.\n\nFinally\
  \ we arrived at our modest hotel room which we ordered through the website a month\
  \ ago. Surprisingly this room has a fairly good equipment for rooms at this low\
  \ price. Hot showers, storage cabinets, clean bathrooms and toiletries are more\
  \ than enough for us. Now is the time for us to take a rest and forget all the bad\
  \ things that happened today starting from being held by airport officers from unclear\
  \ reasons to being scolded by bus drivers.\n\nAfter resting enough, we took a walk\
  \ in the area around our hotel. Luckily our hotel that located in Tsim Sha Tsui\
  \ is a strategic place. High-rise buildings with sparkling LEDs adorn the entire\
  \ city that night. Just a short walk from the hotel we can see the stunning views\
  \ of the Bay of Kowloon and Tsim Sha Tsui clock tower. We ended that night by eating\
  \ spicy wontoon. There was no smile nor thank you from our waiter. Maybe it's time\
  \ for us to get used to it.\n\nThe next morning we went to Ocean Park, an amusement\
  \ park which, although not as famous as Disneyland, was suitable for three grown\
  \ men like us. We use the MTR to go there. As we thought, there were only the sharp\
  \ gazes of the passengers and a long silent. On our arrival, again our friend Joshua\
  \ was scolded by officers because he was only used to swipe train cards Jakarta\
  \ Metro e-gate.\n\n\"Pity you, both here and in Indonesia you are always scolded\"\
  \ said our friend Evo with a teasing tone. We laughed amused even though I also\
  \ felt grateful, because it could have been me who was scolded if I was the first\
  \ to exit the e-gate.\n\nHere it is, the mighty Ocean Park entrance. It would be\
  \ a pity if we didn't capture this moment Evo tried to get help from one of the\
  \ visitors to photograph us. \"wait for sure we will be ignored by her\" I shouted\
  \ but Evo did not hear it. From the distance there appeared to be communication\
  \ between them and she nodded. Smiling, she walked toward us. Amidst my surprise\
  \ I gave my cellphone to her. \n\n\"Okay this angle is good, one two cheese!\" she\
  \ shouted in a thick Cantonese accent. We took turns photographing each other with\
  \ her. After taking pictures we parted with her, it turned out that she was a Hong\
  \ Kong resident who lives in Tung Chung. The rest of thr day was amusing that when\
  \ we returned to the hotel we realized that our legs were already swollen.\n\nThe\
  \ next day is our schedule to Macau. We were confused to reach departure point and\
  \ no one seemed to want to help us . Until there is a woman in uniform who answers\
  \ our questions even with language limitations. With a rather rough intonation she\
  \ pressed the elevator button for us. Before I thought about how fierce she was,\
  \ she smiled when the elevator door started to close. \"Have a nice day\" she said\
  \ as she waved her wrinkled hand. The unexpected attitude of the Hong Kong people\
  \ surprised me once more. The day trip was interesting. We visited several casinos\
  \ until evening and took the night ferry trip back to Hong Kong to rest.\n\nNow\
  \ is the third day, our last day here. On the train to the airport, a woman forced\
  \ an old man to take her seat even though he didn't want to. Finally the old man\
  \ sat down and thanked the woman, what a stunning view. We then continued our journey\
  \ to the airport.\n\nAt 2:00 p.m. our plane finnaly took off. While looking at the\
  \ clouds I contemplate that grumpiness does not necessarily mean hatred. Hong Kong\
  \ taught me that kindness and compassion are not merely interpreted with smiles\
  \ and friendly words but should  manifested by action."
