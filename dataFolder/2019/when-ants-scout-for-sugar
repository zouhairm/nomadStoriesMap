Text: "Here I am. Gazing gracefully at the fluffy blanket of green beneath me, chuckling\
  \ at the army of ants reinforcing the uneasy smoothness of the route. A gush of\
  \ dusty wind humbles me, causing me to shift my dreamy gaze and remember where I\
  \ am. I had been sitting on a secluded edge, on just the tallest, still-climbable\
  \ pyramid in Quintana Roo. I was far from alone, and despite my efforts to not be\
  \ a tourist the reality is that I was another pair of legs in the army.  \n\nBut\
  \ at least I didn\u2019t have a selfie stick.  \n\nI chuckled at my own joke as\
  \ I eased back into a gaze over the colony of ants. They moved with order and persistence,\
  \ as if driven by an airy scent of sugar on top of this ancient ruin. Never really\
  \ taking a new route up, only that which had been smoothed down before them. I suddenly\
  \ felt grateful to be free, to have no schedule and to not be hurried back down\
  \ with the promise of more sugar in another destination.  \n\nI refused to be rushed,\
  \ after all, it had taken me four hours to get to Coba. I ventured out from the\
  \ comfort of Cancun\u2019s hotel zone that morning and, despite my determination\
  \ to travel locally and avoid tourist groups, it wasn\u2019t long before I was asking\
  \ for directions, in English. I was mortified by my inability to even ask \u201C\
  \xBFhabla Ingl\xE9s?\u201D first, and I was ready to divert my plans to downtown\
  \ shopping when I felt a gentle touch on my elbow.  \n\nI looked back to find a\
  \ woman gently gesturing for me to follow her. I watched her for a moment as her\
  \ short stature walked ahead of me, a determined movement causing her wispy brown\
  \ hair to sway side to side. Yet she wasn\u2019t moving very fast, in fact, it looked\
  \ as if she was walking on clouds. I assessed this stranger as the distance grew\
  \ between us, she came across as a woman with a purpose, and an intriguing aura\
  \ of peace. Deciding that I trusted that peace, I broke into a brisk walk to catch\
  \ up.  \n\nShe led me to a local bus, and upon boarding sat next to me with an unintrusive\
  \ smile.  I opened up my body language, willing to find out more about her, about\
  \ local life, about local struggles. I was met with silence. She had brought out\
  \ a book, and I followed by bringing out mine. So we sat side by side with a book\
  \ in our hands as the minivan stretched onto the highway and the heat began to grow.\
  \ I re-read a childhood fiction, the same book that had first intrigued me about\
  \ this side of the world and ancient Mayan culture.  I couldn\u2019t tell you what\
  \ this woman read, or even her name. I thought to myself, periodically during the\
  \ drive, does she \u201C\xBFhabla Ingl\xE9s?\u201D But never dared to disturb her\
  \ peace and ask.  The ride felt like eternity but eventually I received another\
  \ gentle smile from this woman. It was her time to depart from my side, live her\
  \ life and never really think about me again. She indicated that I still had a while\
  \ to go, and so I continued on my journey.  \n\nMy mind darted to that woman as\
  \ I admired the beauty of the jungle beneath my feet. I had the privilege of exploring\
  \ the world, of spending my day on top of an ancient piece of history. And her silent\
  \ help had been pivotal in me getting to my destination, arriving just as I was\
  \ pondering a shopping spree. She owed me nothing more and yet all I desired from\
  \ that encounter was more. I had selfishly wanted a story, a piece of her life as\
  \ a souvenir to show my friends.   \n\nI momentarily felt guilt.  \n\nAs the breeze\
  \ died down the sun\u2019s rays began to scorch, on both my skin and moments of\
  \ thought. At last, I stood up and made my way back down, not particularly taking\
  \ a new route. Simply that which had been smoothed by the tourists before me.  In\
  \ search of more sugar."
