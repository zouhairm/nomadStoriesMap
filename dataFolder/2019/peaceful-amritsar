Text: 'In india there is one of the most spiritual place is Golden temple It is also
  known as Sri Harmandir sahib.Divinity of this temple can only be experienced and
  not described.Serving as a symbol of brotherhood and equality, Golden Temple is
  visited by people from all over the world who come here to seek spiritual solace
  and religious fulfilment. Although the Golden Temple itself is of great historical
  and architectural interest, it is the view of the resplendent shrine, glistening
  in the centre of the tank, bringing an infinite calmness that is most memorable
  to a visitor. After going through a tumultuous period of demolitions, it was rebuilt
  by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in 1830 purely with marble and gold. In spite of the thousands
  of people milling about in the premises of the temple, the only voice you will hear
  around you is silence interspersed with chants of the Sikh prayers.

  The golden structure is a sight of beauty and awe, and despite the regular mantra
  recital; this place is incredibly intriguing and very peaceful. Around the edge
  of the compound, there are more shrines and monuments. The Sikh Museum is located
  inside the main entrance clock tower which shows the oppression endured by the Sikhs
  at the hands of the Mughals, the British and the Indian Government of 1984. The
  Ramgarhia Bunga is a protective fortress located at the southeast end of the tank.
  This fort is surrounded by two Islamic-style minarets. Golden Temple is indisputably
  one of the most exquisite attractions in the world.'
