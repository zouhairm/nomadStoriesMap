Text: "How one town in Northern Italy stopped wasting time and slowed down:  \n\n\n\
  Each wall of the building had been painstakingly pointed with the clumsy mismatched\
  \ bricks brought into some semblance of order by perfectly rendered cement. The\
  \ windows were surrounded by brick brows, arched around chestnut brown lacquered\
  \ louvers. Against the sun, which had not yet slid that low, each pair of louvers,\
  \ five across and four down, were shuttered tight. Each pair, that is, except for\
  \ one. \n\nFar below, I gazed up at the man in the open window whose frailty was\
  \ wrapped up in old-fashioned respectability in the form of a well-pressed, salmon\
  \ shirt. Perched on the inner sill of the highest and furthest window, he looked\
  \ down upon the piazza, expressionless. I dipped my head in a hello, but he turned\
  \ his back and was gone.  \n\nFrom up high, we must have been some sight: an army\
  \ of worker-ants scurrying frantically to set up the instruments we carried. Trumpets,\
  \ tubas, trombones and, in my case, a bass drum on my back, tom-toms in each hand\
  \ and half the colony traipsing behind with the rest of the kit.\n\nVisiting from\
  \ Scotland, the Mayor had invited us to play an afternoon of music as part of their\
  \ Cittaslow project. Borgotaro had been amongst the first wave of small Italian\
  \ towns to sign up to this network, fostering a philosophy of \u2018slowing down\u2019\
  \ to improve quality of life in the wake of modernisation, through a focus on quality\
  \ food, cooked slowly. But since its conception early in 2000, the definition of\
  \ \u2018Cittaslow\u2019 in Borgotaro had grown to mean more than just \u2018slow\
  \ food appreciation\u2019 and now encompassed slow worship, energy, tourism and\
  \ leisure. Although not easy to achieve, their aim was simple: create the ideal\
  \ place to live by slowing down the citizens and letting them enjoy the simplest\
  \ of moments. As the drummer though, my job was to urge everyone on. To be on time.\
  \ To stop them from slowing down. I wondered what the Cittaslow movement had to\
  \ offer people like me and why its popularity had spread to192 countries internationally.\
  \ \n\nStriking up each number, the citizens gathered relishing each tune with uproarious\
  \ glee. I gripped the sticks in the fulcrum of my thumb and forefinger and stroked,\
  \ licked and tickled the drums urging the sluggish brass along. Like so many times\
  \ before, I pounded my way through each bar as rhythmically as the seconds brought\
  \ the afternoon haze. Upbeat, downbeat, crescendo, diminuendo, my feet walked from\
  \ right to left, bass drum to hi-hat, shifting my body with the chop and sizzle\
  \ of the beat.\n\nAs we commenced the final number, I saw the man from the window\
  \ just to my left, leaning against a wall amongst the begonias. He was staring at\
  \ me and the tips of my sticks as they struck, rolled and frenetically thumped out\
  \ beats. \n\nArriving at the final note, he shuffled towards me with theatrical\
  \ arms and thwacking, crinkled lips. I stared at his mouth and the sounds of Italian,\
  \ which I was powerless to interpret. Between us lay an abyss of incomprehension\
  \ until he gently took my hand in his and wrapped my clutch around a single flower.\
  \ I looked at him and then at it. An oversized daisy, its petals were slim, pristine\
  \ white with a glowing centre and tender stalk.\n\u201CBella,\u201D he whispered\
  \ directly at me, but I could only shrug. He cupped his hands over my ears drawing\
  \ me in and lightly placed a kiss on my brow. \u201CBella musica,\u201D he commended,\
  \ then with struggling earnestness, \u201CByoo \u2013 tee - ful mu - sic!\u201D\
  \ Not even waiting for a response, he turned his back and slowly slipped into the\
  \ darkness of his building.\n\nI twiddled the flower between my thumb and forefinger\
  \ rolling the stalk gently back and forth making the tutu of petals dance. As the\
  \ band packed away briskly, I stood running my eyes over the perfectly crooked bricks\
  \ and the soft shadows, which now eclipsed his empty window. Nestled between the\
  \ valleys of Emilia-Romagna, Borgotaro had not just slowed down, it had harnessed\
  \ the gift of making single moments linger on forever in utter, simplistic beauty."
