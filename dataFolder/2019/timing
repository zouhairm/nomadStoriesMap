Text: "There's those moments.\nYou know, the ones that take your breath away. Where\
  \ you can feel it, all throughout your bones, in the pit of your stomach, as it\
  \ seeps into your whole body, right down to your feet. And for that one moment,\
  \ everything feels perfect. Like this, this is where you're suppose to be. \n\n\
  _\n\nIt was early morning and mom called me into the dining room.\n\"We're going\
  \ to Panama City Beach. I booked the condo for 2 weeks, so tell your work.\" \n\
  We did it every year. All four of us. Whether it was Florida or somewhere else,\
  \ it was a tradition my family and I had every year - to travel together somewhere\
  \ for 2 weeks.\n\"Panama City? Why? What's even there?\" I questioned.\nMom explained\
  \ it was beautiful and a doable drive down (yes, drive).\nI wasn't that excited.\
  \ \nI went back and forth with her for a few weeks about it on where we should go,\
  \ but in the end, Panama City Beach it was.\n\nA month later, and there we were.\n\
  \nAs I sat on the sand, my toes feeling the warm ocean water, everything felt right.\
  \ \nNo matter where I am in life, the ocean always seems to make me feel at home,\
  \ even in the darkest of days. \n\nA few days into our vacation, mom and I decided\
  \ to rent some lounge chairs from the beach service. \nThat's where I saw him. I\
  \ noticed him a few days before, and every time he'd look over, I got nervous.\n\
  \nHe set my mom and I up, and we all began talking. I remember thinking how much\
  \ we had in common, and that his smile could light up a room.\n\nA few days passed,\
  \ and when I saw him again, he asked if I wanted to go out with him, and I agreed.\n\
  Just like how the ocean makes me feel - he felt like home to me. \nWe had an amazing\
  \ few days together, just spending time getting to know one another and talking\
  \ about everything under the sun.\n\nI ended up staying behind and booking a later\
  \ flight back home, after my parents and brother drove home a few days prior.\n\
  Never in a million years would I of thought I'd meet someone on a random beach in\
  \ Panama City, and decide to stay just a little longer.\n\nThere's those moments\
  \ with people that are unexplainable. \nThere's those moments with people that take\
  \ you by surprise.\nThere's those moments with people that make you feel like you're\
  \ exactly where you're suppose to be.\n\nHim and I shared an amazing four months\
  \ together. We shared our deepest fears, our stories, our hearts and our minds.\n\
  We did long distance from two different countries and would fly out to see each\
  \ other every month.\nAs hard as it was, it was the most beautiful time of my entire\
  \ life.\n\nWe shared a connection, that even now, is hard to put into words. \n\n\
  \"I don't want to say goodbye.\"\nHe hugged me as he cried into my chest.\n\"Neither\
  \ do I,\" I whispered.\n\"We're going to see each other again, right?\"\n\"I don't\
  \ know.\" \nMy heart shattered.\n\nAs he left and walked through gate A17, that\
  \ was the last time I saw him.\n\nIt's been three months now since I've seen him\
  \ and about two months since we've spoken, and thoughts of him still linger in my\
  \ mind.\n\nIt's all about timing.\nIt's all about those moments.\n\nThere's moments\
  \ that stay with you forever.\nMoments that change you.\nMoments that make you a\
  \ better person.\nMoments that haunt you.\nMoments that you cherish so deep in your\
  \ heart.\n\n\nThose few months were the most unexpected, but the most beautiful.\n\
  \nThank you."
