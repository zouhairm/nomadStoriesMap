Text: "Sampling a sort of baked chickpea pancake at the bustling Rene Socca, Nice,\
  \ the bar manager asks us where we are from. Without making eye contact, I reply\
  \ \u2018the UK\u2019. Any Brit who has travelled in Europe recently knows all too\
  \ well the rising tension between our country and the mainland, with the British\
  \ withdrawal from the EU almost upon us. This, coupled with my consistent failure\
  \ to speak coherent French when it matters, was enough to make me sure that a short\
  \ trip to Nice would lead to a complete cultural disconnect. I was, then, very relieved\
  \ when my response was met with a warm welcome and a friendly exchange in English.\n\
  \nThe British tendency to Westernise all things foreign has made me long for culturally\
  \ \u2018authentic\u2019 experiences wherever I can find them. Admittedly, France\
  \ isn\u2019t the most exotic of destinations, but with my feet on another land\u2019\
  s soil I was determined to experience the French way of life; to make a real connection\
  \ to the city; to have one conversation where I did not stumble over my French or\
  \ confidently state that \u2018je ne comprends pas\u2019. \n\nOn our first night\
  \ in Nice, we set out for a proper French meal. Dipping into the side streets of\
  \ l\u2019Avenue Jean Medecin, with its sparkling shopping centres and fast food\
  \ chains, we found a wealth of restaurants serving everything from Lebanese to Irish\
  \ food. But where were the French delicacies we sought? Eventually, we came across\
  \ Chez Moi, a tiny establishment with a small set menu and (inexplicably for February)\
  \ a large Santa Claus propped up on the bar. The proprietor was proud to demonstrate\
  \ to my partner the correct way to eat snails, but as I tucked into my ratatouille\
  \ it struck me that there was hardly another soul about. If the locals weren\u2019\
  t here, where were they?\n\nThe next day gave us our first real opportunity to explore\
  \ Nice in the daylight. Strolling through Nice\u2019s old town Vielle Ville, with\
  \ its narrow streets, richly coloured buildings and cars parked in surprising places,\
  \ I was reminded of a trip to Naples the previous summer and felt at ease. It helped\
  \ that it was 18\xB0C in early February, too. We joined a walking tour led Polina,\
  \ an enthusiastic Estonian who said she had moved to Nice purely because she was\
  \ so in love with it. Whether this was strictly true or not, she did a good job\
  \ of selling the city. \n\nWith the shouts and chatter of the Monday flea market\
  \ as our soundtrack, Polina walked us through the old town and told us of Ni\xE7\
  oise living. One of the group remarked that it seemed more Italian than French,\
  \ and Polina pointed out that Nice had only been annexed by France relatively recently.\
  \ She showed us Italian restaurants on the seafront, amidst a wealth of other delights\
  \ from the Mediterranean and beyond. Ending our tour atop Mont Boron, looking out\
  \ over the glistening Cote d\u2019Azur, Polina implored us to try the local delicacy\
  \ of socca \u2013 and so we did, and though it was delicious as promised, we could\
  \ not remember seeing the chickpea flour concoction in any French restaurants back\
  \ home.\n\nOur final morning was spent eating bread and cheese on the Promenade\
  \ des Anglais, built for the English aristocracy in the 19th century as they wintered\
  \ in the city. It was a last-ditch attempt to be \u2018French\u2019 before returning\
  \ to the land of Brexit, but as I listened to the saxophonist in the distance and\
  \ turned over one of the beach\u2019s thousands of pebbles in my hand, I wondered\
  \ what I had spent the last few days looking for. I had arrived expecting a France\
  \ that was not far off the ill-informed cultural stereotype that every country tries\
  \ its best to shake off. Rather than striped t-shirts and strings of garlic, I had\
  \ found a beautiful hybrid of European life, and had finally come to the conclusion\
  \ that Italian pizzerias and Estonian tour-guides were more Ni\xE7oise than any\
  \ plate of garlic snails.\n\nTaking my last bite of baguette (or was it ciabatta?),\
  \ I turned towards the old town once more. I had finally felt my Ni\xE7oise connection."
