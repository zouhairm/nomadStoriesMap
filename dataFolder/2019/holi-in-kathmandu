Text: "We arrived at Durbar Square in Kathmandu around 9am. Although the day was sunny,\
  \ we were dressed in below the knee rain gear. We should have been dressed all in\
  \ white.  Today was Holi, the Hindu festival that marks the beginning of spring,\
  \ good over evil, forgiveness and a rollicking good time. Everyone throws colored\
  \ powder at every one in their path and beyond. Hot, intense, bright shades of screaming\
  \ color.  The markets were full of huge bags of seemingly impossible color for sale.\
  \ Squirt guns and water balloons abound because everyone knows that water fights\
  \ are soooo much fun too. The white clothes are to showcase the abstract expressionism\
  \ of the crowd's frenzied guerrilla painting. When we couldn't find white clothes,\
  \ we decided that rain ponchos would be a practical second choice.\nWe had a few\
  \ bags of colored powder that we got from the staff at our hotel. They were very\
  \ over the moon that we were going to get into the spirit  of the holiday. They\
  \ smeared our faces with brilliant red and hot pink and we were off. For a nano\
  \ second, the locals seemed to be taken aback that we were there, but the powder\
  \ was soon flying at us and my hysterical laughter had begun. We were in a dream\
  \ where everyone is equal and fair game in the swirling vortex of magic colored\
  \ clouds. We ran into a group of Japanese tourists who were mesmerized by the spectacle,\
  \ but hung  back to avoid being hit. They asked if they could take our picture and\
  \ soon we were posing with them. We surprised them,  reached into our powder bags\
  \ and ambushed them with a  lime green and yellow barrage. After a moment of shock,\
  \ they started laughing and it seemed like we may have made friends for life. After\
  \ their baptism of color, they threw themselves into the fray.\nIn an adjoining\
  \ square, throngs of people danced through flying color to some sort of trance music.\
  \ Many people had their faces painted with fantastical artwork. Everyone was laughing\
  \ and almost out of body with glee. Even the dogs had color on them. The young kids\
  \ thought it was funny that we were wearing rain gear, so soon we were a target\
  \ for all of them. They were shooting water up the bottom and sleeves of the ponchos\
  \ to make sure that we got really wet, which was overkill because we were simultaneously\
  \ being bombed with water balloons from a party on a second floor balcony. Whenever\
  \ the water fight had a lull, someone would come through and blast you with color\
  \ that stuck to your every surface. We were laughing. Everyone was laughing. Everyone\
  \ was laughing together. I don't know how long it had been since I felt such unbridled\
  \ mirth. and camaraderie.  All with strangers. Soon we were getting invited to neighborhood\
  \ parties and as the rice beer flowed, the hugging and back slapping got even more\
  \ widespread.  I don't know how to explain it, but it truly seemed that for a brief\
  \ thing moment, we had all bonded in silliness and absurdity. Then almost as quickly\
  \ as it started, it faded. We later found out that most people were going home to\
  \ rest for the next round of festivities. \nOnce again, travel has given me a priceless\
  \ memory. This one was in blazing technicolor. I will never be the same."
