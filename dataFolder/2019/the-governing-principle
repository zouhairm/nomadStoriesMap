Text: "I sat on porch chairs that seemed so familiar, although these familiarities\
  \ are dated and carried forward from longing memories, created as a 12-year-old\
  \ girl. Floors are cement, painted over red, with shadows of stained sand particles,\
  \ giving them a comfortable humility. The columns are painted white and stand tall,\
  \ majestic, but at odds with the very cement floors they exist to preserve. The\
  \ weather here typically ranges from humid to almost flood rain; it seems innately\
  \ bipolar for those who grew up in the west. I caught the former of these dualities,\
  \ and lucky for me, within range of my uncle\u2019s modest yet gainful property,\
  \ there bore mango trees that gave me repose by way of sustenance and shelter, from\
  \ the island\u2019s temperamental nature: Jaffna, Sri Lanka, 15 years later, 6 years\
  \ post civil war. \n\nJust when I settled in mid reflection, my uncle storms in\
  \ barking orders at the dogs sitting by my feet. The two mutts arose steadfastly,\
  \ half in admiration, the other in fear. My uncle at 66 years of age, casts quite\
  \ a shadow to all those around him, by way of his 6\u20192 stature and learned presence.\
  \ \u201CDon\u2019t let them get too close to you, they will get spoiled and won\u2019\
  t follow orders.\u201D He yelled out again at my aunt, this time remarking how the\
  \ faded cement floors need to be repainted. This is an impossible task considering\
  \ the island weather.  Wind and sand undoubtable wrecks havoc on such immaculate\
  \ preservation techniques. The cement floors were just another casualty in the fight\
  \ for order, on an island that seems to rush in the opposite direction. My aunt\
  \ knew this, but responded to my uncles orders steadfastly with plans to have it\
  \ painted by a man in town that did the neighbors porch; they had returned to looking\
  \ somewhat faded. My uncle is a man who thrives when there is order, he seeks it\
  \ and actively implements it wherever and whenever he can. Nonetheless, being an\
  \ innate realist and knowing his wife a little too well, he turned to me, grunted\
  \ and said, \u201CIt\u2019ll never get done\u201D, and seated himself in the worn\
  \ half wooden, half woven straw chair next to me.  \n\nBeing a hard worker from\
  \ an early age, he has weathered the ups and downs of the island\u2019s geopolitics\
  \ since birth. He also seemed to think he was an engineer by birth, destined to\
  \ develop the railways of the land. However, as circumstance would have it, he would\
  \ drop out during the 83\u2019 riots for fear of safety, and retained a job as a\
  \ Regional Development Officer in his hometown. Since order was needed in regional\
  \ politics and he could control what he can to ensure things ran smoothly, it was\
  \ seemingly ideal. However, sitting in his retired glory, he looked somewhat relieved,\
  \ order was not on his shoulders anymore.  \n\nHe knew his way around the land and\
  \ his familiarity seemed almost instinctual at this point. We avoided the unnecessary\
  \ rickshaw costs and opted for the motorcycle to venture to the market. The grey\
  \ paved roads accompanied with fresh road markings that weren\u2019t present 15\
  \ years ago, made for a smooth ride, as I sat from behind and observed the rural\
  \ greenery and houses built similar to his. Looking up at a beaming sky was not\
  \ an option, so I settled for the yellow mist that encompassed us. The road led\
  \ us to the market where we were reintroduced to dirt roads tinged with amber. \n\
  \nThere were stalls bursting with fruits and vegetables, each vendor more exuberant\
  \ about quality than the next. My uncle only approached those he had in good faith,\
  \ from his 50 years of making this trip.  The vendors were set up in open-air cement\
  \ red stalls, underneath a wooden rooftop bordering all the action.  There was chaos\
  \ and order living simultaneously, but I felt a rhythm that seemed to govern both,\
  \ a rhythm that my uncle seemed familiar with.  It\u2019s this governing authority\
  \ that seemed to give him solace, in any overarching disorder.  A rhythm that is\
  \ carried forward generationally and predates even him, a rhythm that I now felt.\
  \ It\u2019s not all on his shoulders, and he knew."
