Text: "The story of Night - On my flight to Berlin , i had the usual notion of the\
  \ city . \n\nBustling with energy, vibrant culture and cosmic -culture.  Days were\
  \ spent in covering the massive Berlin Science week , as i admired the immense talent\
  \ in the world of science , amazing speeches motivating the spirit and challenging\
  \ the limits of learning , breaking down the walls of the past. \n\nAt night , i\
  \ stepped out alone on a weeknight.  I didnt expect to find- the serenity of a Berlin\
  \ night.  Coffee stands stood beaming under neon lights, warming up the senses.\
  \ I decided to take a walk across the part overlooking my hotel.  It was a cool\
  \ quiet array of trees moving the winds in all directions . Calm lanes lit up in\
  \ silence light , making the grey green grass visible to the eye, while the quiet\
  \ surroundings surrounded me.  The monuments stood around me in historic magnificence.\
  \ I looked around the buildings as they shined under the moonlit night , It was\
  \ the grandeur of Berlin , the history  , the beauty . There was signs of ancient\
  \ sculptures, writings on the walls and dates that shone , despite the night.  I\
  \ spend the next few hours with my camera capturing the silence in the stories of\
  \ ancient Berlin, where so much had happened. How the city s beauty survived the\
  \ war and the reminiscence of the new vibrant city that speaks volumes of its creation\
  \ , overcoming the conflicts of the past, thriving in the beauty that was - the\
  \ Night in Berlin. \n\nI stopped at the Doner Kebab shop , bought one coffee to\
  \ go with it , sat by the pavement and watched the people go by , as the beauty\
  \ of Berlin by night captivated my senses. So much seen in so little time. My heart\
  \ yearned to stay longer but i had a flight to catch the next day.  In better days\
  \ and time, i might dwell back to Berlin and capture it in all its magnificent glory.\
  \  That Berlin night was unforgettable. An unmatched experience of a historic night\
  \ , of all nights. \n\nI will return to Berlin nights.  Yet again."
