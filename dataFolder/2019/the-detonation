Text: "Standing by the tram tracks on Av. de la Constituci\xF3n, amongst the architecture\
  \ that clearly said Spain, I realised what I\u2019d long since gotten good at \u2013\
  \ I was lost. With two backpacks weighing me down and the heat getting to me, I\
  \ told myself that this was how my first day in Seville was kicking off \u2013 all\
  \ this just to see some Game of Thrones locations. I was missing Cordoba. \n\nI\
  \ was about to ask around in my non-existent Spanish before spotting a free walking\
  \ tour \u2013 the guide, a young woman, was thanking her guests in clear English.\
  \ I told myself that the guide was my saviour and made a beeline for her.\n\n\u2018\
  Hi, I heard you speaking English \u2013 can you help me find my pensi\xF3n,\u2019\
  \ I asked, desperate to get to my accommodation.\n\n\u2018Of course,\u2019 the guide\
  \ replied. \n\nI showed her the dodgy map on my phone and the address for my pensi\xF3\
  n \u2013 she gave me the directions I needed.\n\n\u2018Gracias.\u2019\n\n\u2018\
  Not a problem,\u2019 she said.\n\nOn my way again, I\u2019m optimistic until another\
  \ woman holding sprigs of rosemary approached and insisted I take one. \n\nI\u2019\
  d already encountered a woman like this one in Madrid and after the sprig was pressed\
  \ into my hand she demanded I pay for it \u2013 that\u2019s when I\u2019d taken\
  \ off. I told the Seville woman No but she called out to others in the area \u2013\
  \ they charged and I\u2019m suddenly in Pamplona. \n\n\u2018Piss off!\u2019 I shouted\
  \ at them, legging it and sweating more. \n\nAfter losing the rosemary women, and\
  \ a lot of inner pagan prayer, I found the pensi\xF3n. I climbed the stairs, stepped\
  \ into a reception area with character and dropped my backpacks onto the floor.\
  \ I spoke with the guy at the desk and showed him my reservation.\n\n\u2018There\u2019\
  s a problem with your reservation,\u2019 the man told me, making me want to shout.\n\
  \nBooking.com didn\u2019t submit my correct banking details or something \u2013\
  \ my booking wasn\u2019t confirmed but the man offered an alternative. I think he\
  \ could tell that I wasn\u2019t impressed.\n\n\u2018We can get you into another\
  \ pensi\xF3n for the night \u2013 your room will be available from tomorrow onwards.\u2019\
  \n\nI think I was close to detonation but kept it in. The man got his teenage daughter\
  \ to carry my smaller backpack (the laptop backpack) and lead me to the other pensi\xF3\
  n. I said Thank You and that I\u2019d be back tomorrow, but at that moment I\u2019\
  m feeling something that wasn\u2019t right. \n\nThe girl with my laptop backpack\
  \ led me to the other pensi\xF3n where a woman at reception welcomed her warmly.\
  \ The girl explained everything to the woman before leaving my smaller backpack\
  \ on the floor and left \u2013 I was now at the woman\u2019s mercy. \n\nThe woman\
  \ gave me an old-fashioned room key and said, mostly with her hands, to go up the\
  \ stairs to my right. She offered a Flamingo dancing pamphlet but I wasn\u2019t\
  \ interested \u2013 I just wanted to rest. The look the woman gave me said I was\
  \ an inconvenience \u2013 great. Still, something inside me wasn\u2019t right. Something\
  \ was coming. \n\nI reached the top floor, entered my unappealing room and set both\
  \ backpacks down. I breathed in, hoping things got better, before sitting on one\
  \ of the twin beds \u2013 it was rock hard. I breathed out, and the attack followed.\n\
  \nBreathing fast, my heart rate went at it \u2013 this is what my anxiety looked\
  \ like, only on the other side of the world. Thailand had given me a dose once,\
  \ but I hadn\u2019t expected Spain to deliver. I hated it either way.\n\nShit, I\
  \ thought \u2013 I needed to talk to someone.\n\nI dialled Melbourne, expecting\
  \ to wake my parents but they didn\u2019t pick up. \n\nShit! \n\nI dialled again,\
  \ desperate, and still got nothing. Fuck!\n\nI sat on that rock hard bed as the\
  \ feeling of nothing took over \u2013 my breathing intensified which still didn\u2019\
  t help. I needed someone to come for me, and I didn\u2019t know anyone in Spain.\
  \ The tears were on their way. My breathing was still fierce. The nothingness inside\
  \ of me became hollowness. \n\nPlacing index fingers to my temples, my phone suddenly\
  \ rang.\n\n\u2018Mum?\u2019 I said, answering."
