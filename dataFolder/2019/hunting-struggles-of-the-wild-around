Text: "Strolling down the stairs, kicking the dusty snow along the way, she ran towards\
  \ me with a globe in her hand. At 14,000 feet in the Himalayas, she was shivering,\
  \ not from the cold, she held my hand and asked, 'is the earth really round?' \n\
  \nAfter a whirlpool of questions with the school students in Kibber, I was in the\
  \ basement trying to breathe. What I discovered a few moments ago, was surreal yet\
  \ pure. \n\nAn instance with the students, had given me an opportunity to show them\
  \ the bag full of games & maps l had bought from Mumbai. A seven year old picked\
  \ up the globe and shattered my conscience, when she asked what it was, later to\
  \ discover that none of them knew that the earth was round. \nBaffled by the unknown,\
  \ I ran for help towards my friend, who used to teach them after school and expressed\
  \ the thunderbolt I faced. His idea was that they learn when they face it. My mind\
  \ told me that they just did.\n\nKibber shattered my life in diverse ways. The gentle\
  \ swishing of the winds and the silence of the snow fall, the body fighting against\
  \ the low levels of oxygen , the plethora of mountains ahead, the occasional glimpses\
  \ of the sun, the warmth of the shawl, hunting struggles of the wild around, and\
  \ a few drops of speechless humanity in the people. A three day journey by air,\
  \ rail and road, to a destination with boundaries marked by the Himalayas and resourceless\
  \ education. \n\nHarnessing the strength to do the righteous, I gathered them along\
  \ and pointed them to the map of India on the wall. We played the game of Music\
  \ Ball till they found the map on the globe. Whilst they passed the globe in joy\
  \ waiting for a discovery, for them, it was the globe, the fact that the earth is\
  \ round, but for me, it was them, the village. \n\nWhile I felt that the lack of\
  \ knowledge is making them powerless sitting on top of the world, I was enlightened\
  \ to see their biggest strength, the ease at which they adapt to the change, the\
  \ innocence, the curiosity and the faith they have in the wilderness around."
