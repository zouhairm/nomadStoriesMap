  \ looked back as to ask why , the prettier sight of all her hairs were weaved in\
  \ many directions having an amazing symmetry,if she did it her self marry her ,\
  \ the talk was little cause seeing her so perfect in tight comfy dress sharing words\
  \ in ease her eyes looked like a lake of ice under black sky the darkest shine just\
  \ all this made self to be inspired for theing in life , be better ,for what? For\
  \ her. She is so amazing must have to deserving of her more would appreciable ,so\
  \ didn't ask her out she she said waived just thinking of being so much  better\

  \ yes if done the thought maybe the expectation gets higher so this is really like\
  \ a add on journey yet you be amazed how lucky is this to have life  ,so after time\
  \ when when in church before returning couldn't get in or maybe was closed looked\

  \  very well lost in alleys and parks didn't want to get out by help just discover\
  \ through it cause it's so beautiful to left out , and on side wall smelled something\
  \ ferocious from distance, looked and went ,a cool guy ,asked him how it is the\
  \ response was good the green black high sequence in faith friendship established,\
  \ it's the word that are used to talk decency wins them over , laughing in thoughts\
  \ went ahead the evening calm of sun over skies was reflecting blissful gaze could\
  \ just rest upon nothing and be home of nowhere the very thing was time that we\
  \ had to act by So programmed right? And when mind doesn't listen to it going now\
  \ deeper to emptiness of society spending almost and hour and half the grass was\
  \ sufficient and water was cold seeing reflections and wondering being better so\
  \ is it already happened or there is more to go \nReflexes faster than thoughts\
  \ picked this naily finger ,circling in front couldn't let her go now ,maybe she\
  \ wanted what was happening alone this late near water so scene was picturesque\
  \ hahaha couldn't figure those thoughts then Reflexes figured everything wild she\
  \ smiled when she kissed"
