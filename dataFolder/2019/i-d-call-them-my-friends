Text: "The city of Jerusalem shuts down on Shabbat Eve. By separate invitations, I\
  \ was left with two choices: attend a service at a synagogue or go to the Western\
  \ Wall. As a tourist of no particular religious faith, I wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable\
  \ with either option. I did not want to be perceived as a gawking tourist or be\
  \ disrespectful by my lack of knowledge about customs and traditions. I decided\
  \ to go to the Western Wall. I knew at the Wall I could keep my distance and disjointedly\
  \ observe as people celebrated and prayed. \n\nThe atmosphere around the Western\
  \ Wall was pure and alive with laughing, singing, and dancing. It was nothing short\
  \ of awe-inspiring. On the fringes, moving from empty space to empty space, I moved\
  \ closer to the Wall with a smile that was plastered on my face. Just as an observer,\
  \ I was washed with lightness and happiness. Eventually, a man who was dancing and\
  \ singing came over to me and urged me to join in to the singing and dancing. I\
  \ declined the offer explaining my lack of religious convictions and my respect\
  \ for the evening. He made me an offer, \u201CIf I go dance and sing, will you join\
  \ me?\u201D I barely hesitated.\n\nIn the next moment, the man had locked his arm\
  \ with mine and another man did the same on my other side. I quickly became a part\
  \ of a circle of interlocked arms and smiling faces. All of the men\u2019s voices\
  \ surrounded me in a beautiful song. But what were the words to this song? There\
  \ were no words. The men were producing vocalizations in perfect rhythm and harmony.\
  \ There was no sheet music or plan for the composition; the only guidance was their\
  \ comradery, intuition, and spiritual connection. I was stunned at how a spontaneous\
  \ melody could sound so rehearsed. I did not sing along but rather took everything\
  \ in as we spun in circles. If you could hear me sing, you\u2019d understand why\
  \ my vocalizations would have ruined the evening for everyone. \n\nAs it came closer\
  \ to the official time for prayer, the man asked me to join him closer to the Wall.\
  \ Again, I explained my reverence to the evening and pointed to my outsider status.\
  \ He still encouraged me to join his group. He retrieved a prayer book for me and\
  \ started guiding me through the crowd. On the way, he explained to me that I didn\u2019\
  t need to pray and that I could leave whenever I wanted. This wasn\u2019t an exercise\
  \ in conversion. This was an exercising in connecting as human beings.\n\nThere\
  \ was something comfortably overwhelming about the way the light danced off the\
  \ texture of the stones in the Western Wall and the dense air that was charged with\
  \ voices. The men around me engaged me in conversation and treated me as if they\
  \ had known me forever. I did not pray but I took in their faces, I tried to grasp\
  \ the history the stones of the colossal Wall had seen, and then I brought myself\
  \ to part ways with this group of men who welcomed me so easily. When I was ready\
  \ to leave, I said goodbye and left. The image of smiling faces as I backed away\
  \ from the Western Wall is searing into my memory. \n\nThat evening, religious beliefs\
  \ and other constructed demographic groupings didn\u2019t matter.  Being present\
  \ was all-consuming, and I couldn't help but feel jovial and grateful. It was a\
  \ remarkable display of humanity and love. I wish I knew the names of the men that\
  \ welcomed me in - I would not hesitate to call them friends."
