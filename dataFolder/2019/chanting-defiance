Text: "It's a chilly winter night with a drizzle in the air. Clouds are descending\
  \ on to the terraced rice fields of Bir, a Tibetan Colony in the northern Indian\
  \ state of Himachal Pradesh. Arun, a young Himachali lad who runs a small guest\
  \ house hears hustled footsteps outside his place. He peeps into the verandah through\
  \ a window and sees the outline of three men in robes- monks from a nearby monastery.\
  \ \n\nArun recongizes the young monks, his friends from a previous job he held as\
  \ a helper in the monastery guest house. He's met them on several nights after quitting\
  \ the job; a job he had to leave when his parents came to know that beef is acceptable\
  \ within the monastery kitchen. Ever since his father left his family when he was\
  \ four years old, Arun has been a man looking out after his mother and sister. Working\
  \ from as long as he remembers, Arun has engaged in all tasks and odd jobs that\
  \ would put a meal on the table.   \n\nThe monks, in their maroon robes shared one\
  \ umbrella and were wet at the seams from their walk up the mountain. They didn't\
  \ mind the walk up for this escapade. In their early twenties now, their families\
  \ in Tibet had managed to get them enrolled into one of the monasteries in Bir.\
  \ Growing up in the small mountain village, life was simple, secluded and organised\
  \ but their feet itched some times. Some kind of an unrest brewed within the young\
  \ hearts. \n\nArun opened the door and hushed the monks in. They took out their\
  \ chappals, left the umbrella outside and walked in making sure there wasn't anyone\
  \ watching them from behind. Inside, a dim light tried to warm up the room.\n\n\u201C\
  Is the bucket ready?\u201D asked one of the monks.\n\n\u201CYes, ofcourse,\u201D\
  \ replied Arun in fluent Tibetan and took the cloth off from the bucket and brought\
  \ a bottle which had a whole on its cap. \n\nThis was a simple contraption used\
  \ for efficient smoking of charas (cannabis), a device which had terrified Arun\
  \ when he first saw it long back. Now, the gravity bong, was a regular fixture of\
  \ these meetings. The second monk rolled out the 'stuff' and placed it where it\
  \ had to be and lighted up the contraption. The bottle on top of the bucket filled\
  \ with water gets occupied by the vapours and smoke which is gulped in through the\
  \ mouth. \n\nThey took in the vapours turn by turn and looked up at the ceiling\
  \ and the sky beyond. If it were day, there would be paragliders taking flight in\
  \ the air and the sky would be dotted with colourful parachutes for Bir is known\
  \ to be one of the best paragliding spots in the world. For the monks in that moment,\
  \ the senses were heightened and no more of external stimuli was needed. \n\nEnrolled\
  \ into the monastery without it being a conscious choice, the temple of faith had\
  \ become a prison for these young men who needed an escape every once in a while.\
  \ A hectic daily schedule with little interaction with the outside world can become\
  \ limiting for some young minds. As for Arun, living the life of faith outside the\
  \ monastery, he plays in a field which is beyond that of rightdoing and wrongdoings.\
  \ Whatever feels right, has light, has to be done. \n\nAs they sit there, echoes\
  \ of a gong waft through the space and filter through their ears. They remain oblivious\
  \ to this daily occurrence. The gong has been gonged in the monastery to indicate\
  \ the conclusion of the day's schedule and time for bed. Amidst and beyond all of\
  \ this, the head lama of the monastery sits on his cushion, omniscient of all events.\
  \ He observes them occurring, lets things unfold as they have to and strengthens\
  \ his inner will to add to the spring of life."
