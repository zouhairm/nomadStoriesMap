Text: "I have first experience of traveling to Europe. I went to Europe for participating\
  \ in Summer School Program in Essen, Germany. Then, I visited some countries of\
  \ Schengen group. One of them is France where I had some funny and amazing experience.\
  \ I was interested to learn their habbit and culture. This was the beginning of\
  \ my great journey in France. I found that many of people can not speak English.\
  \ That is why I always used body language as my communication to them. Bad things\
  \ happened when my handphone was broken so I can not write some on google translation.\
  \ Owh Owh.. I know, God will test me to survive within the limitation. First experience\
  \ happened when I would go to Ballroom to watch Ballerina dancing. I got lost on\
  \ the road. I asked some people there where the Ballroom is. I got stuck in explain\
  \ and I tried to describe it by doing dancing on the road. Suddenly, street musician\
  \ came then old woman and men come to join dancing. It is so funny and wonderful.\
  \ I didn\u2019t get the answer but we were dancing together. Another thing I got\
  \ is when I was in the train. There is an old woman just came but it was too crowded.\
  \ She looked tired. I was initiative to give my seat to her. After I got up from\
  \ my seat, she hug me so tight and say thank you (in French). After that, She was\
  \ not doubt to invite to just drink a cup of tea at her home (by pull my hand to\
  \ follow her). I feel a warmness within them although I am using scarf, they were\
  \ not afraid to me. It opened my eyes that in difference we can unite. \n-First\
  \ lovely experiences-"
