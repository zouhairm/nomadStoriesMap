Text: On a blisteringly cold winter's day in Incheon, South Korea, I woke up thinking
  I'd missed my stop and actually got off the bus one stop early. It was too cold  to
  add two blocks to what was already a four block walk, but no transfer buses were
  coming and it seemed lazy and ridiculous to pay another fare for a two block ride.
  So, I decided to walk. But where? The street I was on was totally unshoveled and
  now a block of ice. I considered walking on it anyway, but there was a woman coming
  toward me, doing the very thing, and she was walking like the Scarecrow from the
  The Wizard of Oz.  I didn't want a fall in my future; so, I walked in the street
  for a half block.  Crazy, I know.  The driving in Korea is something to be respected.  The
  road is for cars - not people.  But walk in the street I did and then crossed to
  the other side.  It was better for a bit, but eventually, just another block of
  ice. I stood still.  Looked around, trying to decide which route was best.  In ascertaining
  this I must have looked a little dazed and confused because a man tapped me on the
  shoulder and showed me his phone. It said, in English, "May I help you?" In that
  moment, I cared for Korea again - deeply.
