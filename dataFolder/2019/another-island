Text: "This is a transmedia project based on utube channel with a 3-min documentaries\
  \ filmed in Portugal (with English subtitles). Bright, emotional stories that affect\
  \ different aspects of the life of Portugal society (cultural characteristics, stereotypes,\
  \ politics, nature, urbanism, national color, religion, business, etc.). It will\
  \ be film-portraits in the style of cinema verite as a basis for transformation\
  \ of these stories into full-length international documentary films (co-production).\
  \ It's like a database with workpieces, templates and with all information in Russian\
  \ and English languages.\n\nReference: https://www.youtube.com/user/STATELESSMEDIA\n\
  \nThe goal is to draw the attention of foreign colleagues to this project and to\
  \ find producers, co-directors for the development of these short stories into big\
  \ documentaries and it's screening at the foreign film festivals, and then sale\
  \ at the film markets for European TV channels.\n1.\tThis project will help international\
  \ producers find interesting stories and heroes for documentary projects.\n\n2.\t\
  At the same time, such a project minimizes the risks, since a short video story\
  \ is a procurement that demonstrates the essence of confiture, the presence of contact\
  \ with the real heroes of this story, and the overall potential of such a project.\
  \ This is much more effective than the more traditional presentation of the project\
  \ in a form of text, photographs and pictures.\n\nHere is an example of such a short\
  \ documentary that I shot for this purpose: https://vimeo.com/96080093\n\nIf the\
  \ producer or studio is interested in the implementing a selected story, then he\
  \ has the opportunity to contact me or my representative for discussion, to receive\
  \ more detailed information and to conclude a contract for the implementation of\
  \ a co-production project.\n\nAs a result I expect:\n\n1.\temergence of international\
  \ documentary projects;\n2.\tdevelopment of international cooperation;\n3.\timplementation\
  \ of Russian film content in the European film markets;\n4.\tovercoming intercultural\
  \ boundaries;\n5.\tpromotion of the ideas of globalization and cooperation between\
  \ Russia and other countries;\n6.\tideally - cooperation with such channels as ARTE,\
  \ BBC, etc.\n\nPersonal interest:\n\n1.\tparticipation in international projects\
  \ as a local producer, director or co-director;\n2.\treach more professional relations,\
  \ finding partners abroad for the implementation of international projects;\n3.\t\
  creating a reputation as a specialist in the field of international art projects\
  \ and co-production; \n\nI once filmed in Portugal. I spent three months on the\
  \ island of Madeira. But this is only a small part of Portugal. And I want to continue\
  \ writing and filming about this country https://vimeo.com/74402097 ."
