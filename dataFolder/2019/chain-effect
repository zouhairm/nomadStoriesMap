Text: "\"Hurry up! Hurry up! \"Captain Fammi smiled conversely his enhanced up his\
  \ voice as this was the fourth time he had rushed us to get on board. Therefore,\
  \ I quickly checked all my equipment and started spiriting to the boat and hopped\
  \ on. It was still early in the dawning, but I could feel the ultraviolet light\
  \ was burning my shoulders, I picked a site where there's a shade to protect my\
  \ skin from the sun, but even hidden under the shade I could still feel the heat\
  \ in the ambiance, we were all squinting our eyes cause of the sun was too bright,\
  \ it was hurt to see. The rhythmic pounding punctured the stillness \u2014fwtt fwtt\
  \ fwtt, ''Excited?'' asked by Fammi well he started the engine. \"Woh Woh Woh''\
  \ we shut out to respond. Fammi steered the boat carefully away from the shallow,\
  \ I felt the wind gently kisses my skin. When we were out of the shallow we speeded\
  \ up, as the wind became stronger we got more exhilarating, we put on the song \"\
  Hope\" by The Chainsmokers, I grabbed my sunglasses then staggered to the front\
  \ of the boat where could lie down, I sat down and laid on the windshield, I used\
  \ my arms as a pillow, closed my eyes and enjoyed sunbath along with the swiftness.\n\
  \nDidn't notice how many minutes had gone by, when I opened my eyes the island where\
  \ we were was the size of my hand. Fammi slowly worked down the speed so he can\
  \ direct the direction, ''We used to see Dolphins around here.'' said by one of\
  \ the crew. We all make our eyes to the sea and hoped we could see one of them jumping\
  \ out of the surface, conversely, I saw a couple things that don't belong to the\
  \ ocean were floating on the water -oil, and plastics. I wasn't surprised by that,\
  \ I was confused, but what shocked me accordingly to what I saw next with my own\
  \ eyes. \n\n''What are they doing?'' One of my friends asked. My focus changed from\
  \ the floating plastics to a boat was two sizes bigger than ours. I wasn't 100%\
  \ sure but I saw three men working on the deck, there's one with a hat had his hand\
  \ on the rudder, the other two younger boys I would call, were bumping rubbish,\
  \ tossing buckets of food waste into the ocean. By the word I'm using working it's\
  \ because they were bumping through a red dumpster that I saw one on the island\
  \ where I stayed. Meaning what they're giving the ocean wasn't just theirs, it's\
  \ everyone's probably mine too. We speeded up, moving the opposite way from them\
  \ as they got smaller and smaller till their boat disappeared in my sight.\n\nBags\
  \ and bags of human mutilation, I was taken offense but not because what they were\
  \ doing, they were just getting paid to get the job done, I was enraged because\
  \ I couldn't do anything to stop this. Fammi and his crew didn't say a word when\
  \ we were all hesitation, I didn't blame them, I knew the ocean was their life,\
  \ they eat from it, they make money from it, they depend ocean mostly on everything,\
  \ they didn't have more land spaces to barred or to burn therefore tossing into\
  \ the ocean is the best way. \n\nSince I started free-diving and got so in touched\
  \ with the ocean, I saw the corals are bleaching, animals dying eating plastic by\
  \ mistakes, I even dived in a place where there're only human wastes but no breathing\
  \ life. I know how bad we had done to Mother Nature, I saw it, the cruel destruction.\
  \ I can guarantee to see with your own eyes the sensation feeling is way worse than\
  \ reading it on papers or watching it no news. I'm still learning and wish to change,\
  \ I alter myself to reduce single-use or any plastic items, not using sunscreen.\
  \ By sharing my stories, telling what I saw or learned to every person I can get\
  \ in touch with, hoping to start a chain effect, letting more people truly know\
  \ what is happening and what had already happened."
