Text: "Its start when I'm finished my senior high school. I'm 18 years old when I\
  \ was finished my school and I to much time before I start my study at the University.\
  \ I brave myself travelled to Bali. I'm start from Makassar airport to Denpasar\
  \ airport, that's my first time in the airplane and take a time about 1 hour 30\
  \ minutes. When the flight above the Bali island, we can see colorful lights and\
  \ the lights from Mandara's toll. When I first set my feet at Bali, I hear bali's\
  \ gamelan and that sound is so beautiful. My cousin and her husband picked me up\
  \ with their car and we go to their house in Denpasar. On the way to Denpasar from\
  \ the airport, I see  bali's house that's different from the house in south sulawesi,\
  \ to much foreign people walking in the sidewalk, warung or restaurant and etc.\
  \ Before I sleep, my cousin give me dinner with Indonesian food, sate. \nTomorrow\
  \ morning, my cousin's husband, I called him Mr. Yu ask me to go to Ubud with him\
  \ because he want to check his brother company. On the way to Ubud, I saw many beautiful\
  \ rice and that village in Ubud very naturally. When we arrive at the company, Mr.\
  \ Yu said that if I'm bored, I can go to in front of that company and meet a new\
  \ people. So I walked around 5 meters from that company and see beside my foot,\
  \ I found something like flowers in many colors such as yellow, red, green, white\
  \ and one candy in the same place. I asked Balinese I met there, \"what's this?\"\
  , and the Balinese says we called that Canang. Canang is the daily offerings to\
  \ thankful Balinese Hindu's God. We can find canang at their Pura, in front of their\
  \ hous and on the street or sidewalk. On sidewalk I meet without stopping foreign\
  \ people, I want to talk to them because I need to practice my english but I'm embarrassed\
  \ to them. Then I think, why I learned about English in the school but not practice.\
  \ So I start to smile with foreign who I meet and they smile to me and say hi to\
  \ me. We talking to much, I said I want to practice my english and they welcome\
  \ to me. That's my first time talk to foreign people, in Ubud.\nOne the next day,\
  \ I was go to in the north kuta, Seminyak area at Mr. Yu company again. Then he\
  \ tell his nephew to bring me to Seminyak beach, the one of beautiful beach in the\
  \ paradise island, Bali. That's a really nice beach, we can see beautiful sunset,\
  \ a lovely sound of the wave, a people with their families, couples, friends, pets\
  \ and they looked really happy, we can see a people swimming, diving enjoy the music,\
  \ exeraise, playing football, drunk and etc. We can see a people from another country,\
  \ different religions, different ages, smile each other, that's make me feel warm\
  \ to see them. I just enjoyed the beautiful sunset then go to the beach to wet my\
  \ feet then walking in the beach, I really loved that. \nA few days later, in the\
  \ morning I try myself to ride my cousin's scooter from Denpasar to Kerobokan. On\
  \ the way, I used google maps. Arrived Kerobokan I try to eat Nasi Jinggo, that's\
  \ my first time ate nasi jinggo, that's very delicious and cheaper, only 5 thousands\
  \ rupiah or 1 US dollar we can get 2 nasi jinggo (Jinggo's rice). I parking the\
  \ scooter at basangkasa street and go to the traditional market at seminyak. In\
  \ the traditional market, I see people selling Canang, traditional cake, fruits\
  \ ice, and etc. In that market, someone ask me that \"are you from Java? You look\
  \ like Javanese from Bandung\", and I said \"No, I'm from South Sulawesi\" then\
  \ He smile to me. From the market, I met a Balinese. His name is Ngurah. I called\
  \ him Pak Ngurah, Pak in english mean is Mr. I ask about the beach in Bali, and\
  \ he says to much beautiful beach in Bali, from this way you can go to petitenget\
  \ beach, then this way Oberoy beach, and if you go to seminyak beach, you can walked\
  \ on that beach untill Kuta beach. And that's amazing, before I go to Bali, I always\
  \ knew Kuta beach not the other beach in Bali. Not only Kuta beach have a beautiful\
  \ view or sunset, the other beach in Bali too. After that I go to Double six beach,\
  \ than Kuta beach and the others day, I go to Pandawa beach with my cousin and her\
  \ husband, who have a white sand and gorgeous sunset with the coconut drink beside\
  \ me. In Pandawa beach, we can find a big Pandawa's statue. I've take a picture\
  \ with the the one of the statue, Arjuna. From the Pandawa beach, we go to take\
  \ a prayer at Nusa Dua who have 5 prayers place. There are Muslim's,Hindu's, Buddha's,\
  \ Protestan's and Catholic's prayers place In the one area. Then we back to Denpasar\
  \ through Bali's Mandara toll. That's beautiful lights on the tool's way. Bali has\
  \ to much story for me, their food, their way, the gorgeous people I met, everywhere\
  \ I can see a smile from to many people, their traditional home, traditions, and\
  \ to many good things I can find there."
