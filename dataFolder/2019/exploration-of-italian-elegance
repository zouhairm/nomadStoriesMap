Text: "The Italian culture is one of the most Ancient an artist of culture in the\
  \ European countries, Italy is home to more than 62 million individuals as of 2017\
  \ and is ranked 23rd in population size when compared with other countries throughout\
  \ the world. Italian culture is steeped in the arts, family, architecture, music\
  \ and food. Home of the Roman Empire and a major center of the Renaissance, culture\
  \ on the Italian peninsula has flourished for centuries. Here is a brief overview\
  \ of Italian customs and traditions.About 96 percent of the population of Italy\
  \ is Italian, though there are many other ethnicities that live in this country.\
  \ North African Arab, Italo-Albanian, Albanian, German, Austrian and some other\
  \ European groups fill out the remainder of the population. Bordering countries\
  \ of France, Switzerland, Austria, and Slovenia to the north have influenced Italian\
  \ culture, as have the Mediterranean islands of Sardinia and Sicily and Sardinia.The\
  \ official language of the country is Italian. About 93 percent of the Italian population\
  \ speaks Italian as native language, according to the BBC. There are a number of\
  \ dialects of the language spoken in the country, including Sardinian, Friulian,\
  \ Neapolitan, Sicilian, Ligurian, Piedmontese, Venetian and Calabrian. Milanese\
  \ is also spoken in Milan. Other languages spoken by native Italians include Albanian,\
  \ Bavarian, Catalan, Cimbrian, Corsican, Croatian, French, German, Greek, Slovenian\
  \ and Walser.\"Family is an extremely important value within the Italian culture,\"\
  \ Talia Wagner, a Los Angeles-based marriage and family therapist, told Live Science.\
  \ Their family solidarity is focused on extended family rather than the West's idea\
  \ of \"the nuclear family\" of just a mom, dad and kids, Wagner explained Italians\
  \ have frequent family gatherings and enjoy spending time with those in their family.\
  \ \"Children are reared to remain close to the family upon adulthood and incorporate\
  \ their future family into the larger network,\" said Wagner.Religion in Italy\n\
  The major religion in Italy is Roman Catholicism. This is not surprising, as Vatican\
  \ City, located in the heart of Rome, is the hub of Roman Catholicism and where\
  \ the Pope resides. Roman Catholics and other Christians make up 80 percent of the\
  \ population, though only one-third of those are practicing Catholics. The country\
  \ also has a growing Muslim immigrant community, according to the University of\
  \ Michigan. Muslim, agnostic and atheist make up the other 20 percent of the population,\
  \ according to the Central Intelligence Agency Art and architecture in Italy\nItaly\
  \ has given rise to a number of architectural styles, including classical Roman,\
  \ Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical. Italy is home to some of the most famous\
  \ structures in the world, including the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.\
  \ The concept of a basilica \u2014 which was originally used to describe an open\
  \ public court building and evolved to mean a Catholic pilgrimage site \u2014 was\
  \ born in Italy. The word, according to the Oxford Dictionary, is derived from Latin\
  \ and meant \"royal palace.\" The word is also from the Greek basilik\u0113, which\
  \ is the feminine of basilikos which means \"royal\" or basileus, which means \"\
  king.\"\n\nItaly also is home to many castles, such as the Valle d'Aosta Fort Bard,\
  \ the Verr\xE8s Castle and the Ussel Castle."
