Text: "Victor Hugo once said: \u201CThat one is the most beautiful square in the world\u201D\
  . I will always remember that moment, that blitz trip of mine, regardless I came\
  \ back home even with more doubts than I had before I put every drop of hope in\
  \ a flight to Brussels. However, I did the craziness I thought I had to, as a 27-year-old\
  \ \u201Cgrown-up\u201D. I had nothing to lose, apart from the common sense that\
  \ unluckily was already gone. Furthermore, I saw a wide horizon colored with a serious\
  \ amount of opportunities to become my Heaven on Earth, just waiting in front of\
  \ my naked eye. I did my bet and I still don\u2019t know who won, if there was ever\
  \ to be a winner at all. I regret nothing, though... \nThere she was coming towards\
  \ me. I knew it was her. It just could be her. I mean, there was literally nobody\
  \ else around, to be honest. Only the freshness of a casual Saint Valentine\u2019\
  s night and that charming light pollution to randomly witness our encounter. There\
  \ she was, arriving all dressed up in black, fancy, posh as she could, sweating\
  \ style from all over, to the Grand-Place. \u201CThe most beautiful square in the\
  \ world in words of Victor Hugo. Tell her that in French, once you see her\u201D\
  , I repeated to myself like a mantra. I practiced the intonation out loud several\
  \ times, pretending I was a genuine Frenchman. \u201CTell her you are so happy to\
  \ be here, in her adoptive country, next to her, after God knows how much time it\
  \ has been since you last saw her, and magic will happen. Wrap her in your arms\
  \ and kiss her, there is no big deal. Come on, it has to work out!\u201D I kept\
  \ talking to my inner maniac, plenty of times as a reminder. I didn\u2019t dare\
  \ to warn you in advance that I was about to pay a visit to make everything more\
  \ poetic. The truth needs to be spoken, I was way too drunk to think clearly. I\
  \ don\u2019t know yet if I drank that much because I was so desperately hopeless,\
  \ that I knew I wasn\u2019t going to meet her that night, or if I did it so that\
  \ I could easily forget, at least for a while, that I was so desperately hopeless\
  \ because I wasn\u2019t going to meet her that night. The sole fact that mattered\
  \ was that I couldn\u2019t think properly, and even as drank as I knew I was, I\
  \ felt so nervous when I noticed that there was she coming.\nI still remember the\
  \ first words you said while approaching to Grote Markt. You were visibly gesticulating\
  \ with both arms, showing up your perplexity, asking for explanations. I guess I\
  \ just replied to your enquiry with a solemn and profoundly childish: \u201CS-U-R-P-R-I-S-E\u201D\
  . I must admit it, I am a talkative person, and under certain circumstances I don\u2019\
  t mind showing off my derisory, and excruciatingly overrated writing skills. Although,\
  \ that was not what my body asked for at that moment. You also asked me, how much\
  \ time in advance I took to deliver my infamous surprise. And then it was my turn\
  \ to do the mimics. I touched my chin, like Le Penseur of Rodin as the best response.\
  \ \nOnce, you asked me, using a French song from one of the infinite cast of musicals\
  \ that you adore: \u201CWhat do you want from me?\u201D. For what I said: I\u2019\
  ll answer to that question whenever you expect it the less. I imagined that crossing\
  \ 1500 km to stare in front of your blue eyes could possibly happen to be the best\
  \ way to do so. Or maybe I just wanted to discuss with you, face to face, about\
  \ the curious proportions of the Brussels Town Hall, that sadly made his architect\
  \ to commit suicide. Perhaps, I just wanted to have an ordinary conversation about\
  \ something stupid that came to my mind before you said: \u201Cshut and kiss me\u201D\
