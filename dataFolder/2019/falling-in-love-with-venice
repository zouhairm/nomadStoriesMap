Text: "As a kid, I had this memory game card set that I loved very much. They had\
  \ different photos representing each city. For instance, New Delhi had a snake charmer\
  \ (yeah! :/), London had Big Ben, San Francisco had The Golden Gate Bridge and so\
  \ on\u2026 The card for Venice had the picture of a three-tier Gondola with the\
  \ canal in the background. The idea of a city on the water with canals instead of\
  \ roads seemed very exotic to me. Ever since I have been obsessed with it and over\
  \ the years my obsession with Venice had become my obsession with Italy. And guess\
  \ what? I got to tick Venice off my bucket list in April!!\n\nPeople say that you\
  \ either love Venice or hate it \u2013 there is no way you can be indifferent to\
  \ the city. And after dreaming of what it would be like for the better part of my\
  \ life, I was prepared to be disappointed once I landed because I didn\u2019t think\
  \ reality could beat my imagination. So after checking in at our hotel and a refreshing\
  \ bath, we soon headed to Piazza San Marco. At first glance, the city seemed and\
  \ felt like a typical tourist trap. Restaurants, Murano Glass Shops, Souvenir Shops\
  \ and a lot of tourist attraction points rammed into one square. There are attractions\
  \ peppered all over the different islands, but Piazza San Marco is the center of\
  \ all the hubbub. It is a city with a lot of art and culture to offer to its visitors.\
  \ At the same time, it is also a city that can deliver gastronomic pleasures with\
  \ its usual flair. It can also be a shopper\u2019s paradise.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019\
  t until I had a look around and ended up sitting down on the bank at the Piazzetta\
  \ for a break that I really took notice of the rustic charm of the place.  We ended\
  \ up skipping a lot of \u201Cspots\u201D that we had planned to visit and walked\
  \ around the town instead. We switched off our Google Maps and made it a game to\
  \ see how long we could walk without having to cross a canal. Sounds childish perhaps,\
  \ but it was fun discovering small cafes, churches, and different piazzas on our\
  \ own. We may have missed out on some of the \u201Cmust see\u201D places that make\
  \ lists look good, but we also got to avoid the crowd and see the side of Venice\
  \ that perfectly planned trips do not cover. The beautiful bridges that connects\
  \ the city, the modern touch-ups on really old buildings, the really small alleyways\
  \ (the last two things did make me think of Banaras/Varanasi for a second), lovers\
  \ locks at random bridges, the gondoliers trying to convince you to take a ride\
  \ with them and the chefs insisting that you don\u2019t have to pay unless you absolutely\
  \ love their food \u2013 things that you do not seem to take much notice of at the\
  \ beginning to turn out to be the things that you take away from the city. To enjoy\
  \ this city, you have to forget your plans and just follow where your heart takes\
  \ you.\n\nVenice did not knock me off my feet nor did it Wow me. It kind of grew\
  \ on me and captured my heart. The really old buildings with crumbling plasters,\
  \ the cheery Gondolas, the narrow alleys and the small pizza parlours \u2013 all\
  \ it took was 3 days \u2013 to fall in LOVE."
