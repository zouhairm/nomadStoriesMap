Text: "He lowers the decibels of the indignant sirens of the Medellin Police. He inhales\
  \ the authentic mix of fresh arepas, marijuana and the ever so often winter rainy\
  \ showers. Under the Gilberto Echeverri Mejia Bridge, on a somber November night\
  \ in Antioquia, Colombia, a young artisan equips his tool of choice, his skateboard.\
  \ He has rebuked school and embraced the tattoo on his hip distinguishing his skate\
  \ group. \u201CListo?\u201D he yells as he turns his weathered baseball cap backward,\
  \ signaling the beginning of his performance. Normally the skateboarder is a solo\
  \ act, only allowing the ensemble of reggaeton, rush hour traffic and graffiti to\
  \ share his stage.\n\nTonight, however, he is accompanied by another artist. Not\
  \ a fellow skateboarder nor a fellow Colombian, this artisan squats in a poised\
  \ stance awaiting his counterpart to approach. A couple shades darker, but many\
  \ years older, the photographer aims his lens at the skateboarder. The photographer\u2019\
  s tattered Adidas and the evident rain and sweat stains on his shirt are merely\
  \ accessories of his craft. He puts all his energy into making his right eye and\
  \ right index finger work in sync. The photographer gives the universal thumbs up\
  \ to signal he\u2019s ready. As the skateboarder descends the ramp, the photographer\
  \ rest into position. Heartbeats race, sweat trickles, the snack vendor offers cheap\
  \ plant\xEDnitos for 3500 Colombian pesos. At this moment, pure art lingers in the\
  \ atmosphere, never to be cataloged in a museum, never to receive international\
  \ acclaim and never to have an encore show.\n\nHours earlier: Alejandro arrives\
  \ under Gilberto Echeverri Mejia Bridge from Poblado, a community four minutes away.\
  \ He greets his contemporaries, tells jokes, and even takes a couple of hits of\
  \ stress relief here and there. Despite the 13 stitches in his leg and the many\
  \ painful spills on the unforgiving concrete, Alejandro has made the space under\
  \ the bridge both his second home and his canvas. As the clouds darken and the traffic\
  \ thickens, the bridge becomes a temporary shelter for those who forgot to check\
  \ the weather. The drenched and dry alike pour in under the bridge. The street vendors\
  \ shift into gear and Alejandro prepares himself. It\u2019s time to put on a show.\
  \ It\u2019s time to perfect his art. \n\nAmong the drenched visitors sits Zay. His\
  \ journey to Colombia underground is not intentional nor is it a solo one. Accompanied\
  \ by Paula Echevarria, a Columbian American, the photographer takes the 1981-mile\
  \ flight from Atlanta to Medellin, in one major pursuit, to perfect his craft. As\
  \ a result of his mission, earlier this same rainy-day, Paula takes Zay to Parque\
  \ Arvi, an illustrious sky cab ride that overlooks the city. Upon returning to Itagui,\
  \ Paula insists on going under \u201Cthe bridge\u201D. After dismissing the idea\
  \ the day before, Zay relents and they go under \u201Cthe bridge\u201D. However,\
  \ upon entering the skatepark, Zay unsheathes his tools, scans the area, and begins\
  \ to look for angles and the moments that would depict this scene. It\u2019s time\
  \ to capture the show. It\u2019s time to perfect his art. \n\nZay presses the autofocus\
  \ button. Alejandro rushes full speed up the ramp and takes flight. Zay\u2019s right\
  \ finger presses the button. Click, Scrkkkktt, Roll. The show was performed. The\
  \ show was captured. The artistic vision has been made into something tangible.\
  \ The two artisans exchange a handshake. Zay shows Alejandro the picture. Alejandro\
  \ gives Zay a skateboard sticker. Communication is difficult as Alejandro speaks\
  \ little English, and Zay knows little Spanish, but it doesn\u2019t matter. As they\
  \ share tomate de arbol juice, an enjoyable conversation of gestures and translation\
  \ via Paula ensues. At that moment they take part in a mystical art form that transcends\
  \ the photo just took or the trick just performed. On a stormy day, under the Gilberto\
  \ Echeverri Mejia Bridge, the two artists take part in connecting with somebody\
  \ they barely know. They will never reenact this art with each other, they will\
  \ never have an encore performance, and they will never receive any accolades or\
  \ awards. But at that moment in time, the artists connected in a way that in a solitary\
  \ world, is an art in itself."
