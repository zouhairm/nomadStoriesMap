Text: "A month previous departing on another adventure, a friend gifted me a blank\
  \ journal insisting it would be nice to describe my new experience and read it later\
  \ on, despite of making sure, I would have some company, as I was going only with\
  \ my own self. Time flew, when I realized, I was glancing the surrounds, those bright\
  \ stars of my first night into the unknown. Sitting on the terrace, filling pages,\
  \ writing how that landscape looked gorgeously terrible. Making notes regarding\
  \ my first impression of my future three months home. It was also the first night\
  \ of insomnia, caused by stress and the moldy smell of my room, a hindrance trough\
  \ the complete night. I spent those long hours wondering If study Spanish in a socialist\
  \ country was a reasonable idea, considering how would I survive, without internet\
  \ or speaking no Spanish at all. \n\nSurprisingly, passed a week, most of the time\
  \ I did not even know where my phone was at anymore, and I was managing to communicate,\
  \ because fortunately, my Portuguese gave me a great hint. On the other hand, what\
  \ I came to find, was that those things were not even a challenge, neither the cold\
  \ showers that I was not aware of before going. During this time, complaining was\
  \ not a thing, in fact, I found myself in a position where I had no rights of self\
  \ victimization; A white privileged girl, which whom had money to survive, and a\
  \ great life waiting for it just a plain ticket away, where nothing of this existed.\
  \ Well, at least, not at the tiny world my head used to live.\n\nWithin time that\
  \ journal started to get volume, from filled pages of someone\u2019s else pain I\
  \ was feeling, and additionally the tears. Pauses were necessary. I routinely sat\
  \ down on the edge of that broken bed, recalled my day, selected memories, and turned\
  \ them into words. Pages full of emotion, as I would encounter from barefoot kids\
  \ running on the dirtiest streets, to people trying to commit suicide along those\
  \ days. \n\nUsually when walking around, I regularly would see \u201C2+2=5\u201D\
  \ on various graffitied walls. Which later I discovered, was a manner of saying\
  \ their lives were not a straight math, where there are an exact answer, specially\
  \ in a place their voices have no turn to speak for themselves. According to the\
  \ touristic perception of it, that is the land of salsa, rum and happy people. In\
  \ some ways I would agree with, meanwhile, I could not conform myself with many\
  \ conditions. For instance, the sexism in a surreal way, even though some saw it\
  \ as a self esteem invigorate, and most woman were even accustomed to it, as opposed\
  \ to it, not me. Furthermore, I was a foreigner, better known as a target of money,\
  \ and again, I had no rights to judge or feel bad for myself, as opportunities are\
  \ not frequent in that island. All of that confusion, contradiction and more, contributed\
  \ to my understanding about different math results that made no sense. \n\nIt is\
  \ important to recognize, a part of it my friend was correct, today, that journal\
  \ is where I can remember my experiences. However, not the way she expected, it\
  \ is not about pretty memories and reading them with a smile, it actually is a reminder\
  \ of the lesson it gave me, even though they can be extremely harsh. Contemplate\
  \ this disastrous calligraphy is a true gift, I see from all this melancholy, where\
  \ I found empathy, love, and specially gratefulness. And to conclude, I would like\
  \ to share the last stated phrase I wrote while on that reality: \u201DThis trip\
  \ changed my life, made up a new person, which whom sees her surroundings in a gentler\
  \ and more empathic way from now on, thank you and goodbye Cuba\u201D."
