Text: "As the plane descended, as did the snowflakes that fell that day.\nCroatia,\
  \ Oh! What a thrill! Finally !, my dream since I have memory.\nShe welcomes me with\
  \ a white blanket, a little pleasant scene, for a \nLatina who never had been so\
  \ close to the snow.\n\nWith that feeling that every traveler lives, fear and insecurity,\n\
  \ made it cross the gates of the airport, \nready for a new life and adventure ...\
  \ But there was a big problem,\nfor each sign that i passed, my face was more disfigured,\n\
  GOD WHAT IS THIS, I DO NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING!\n\nOn my way to the city, in a taxi\
  \ with an unkind man who did not \nunderstand anything about my English,\nMy fear\
  \ and anxiety grew, I transformed that\nIn the motor of my travels, crossing a border,\
  \ \nmeant growing as a human being.\nThe story of the hostel that I arrived at and\
  \ HOW I arrived...I'll leave that historie for another chapter, hilarious!\n\nIt\
  \ was February, and the sowing of snow did not leave me until the end of March.\n\
  \nFor 4 months, I laid my bones on a mattress with springs, \nI shared a room with\
  \ an Austrian girl, and two more Latinas ...\nPoor Austrian! So minimalist, and\
  \ we were so colorful.\n We know how much she suffered.\n\nMy dormitory was precarious,\
  \ but it would only be a semester\n\nThe main reason for my trip was to study, in\
  \ the beautiful city of Zagreb.\nBut the real reason for me was: to satisfy my whim.\
  \ Return to my lands\nwhich Sherlock Holmes, in search of my ancestry.\nWalk through\
  \ the streets of Zagreb, spend an afternoon,\ntalking and enjoying the movie in\
  \ which i was the main character.\n\nArriving in Croatia was a leap into the unknown\
  \ (not knowing anything about anything, not even the language)\nI got involved with\
  \ the Croatian people, as much as I could,\nto feel like my ancestry, identify with\
  \ my roots.\nI didn't expect to find anything of what I found and lived. \nThe parties,\
  \ friends, sunsets, landscapes, the odyssey of going to a supermarket\nand understand\
  \ what was bought, when we innocently cooked spaghetti with cream, \nand from nowhere\
  \ they were transformed into spaghetti with sweet cream. (Something that makes us\
  \ laugh until today).\n\n\nI liked it so much! I didn't want to leave, and in the\
  \ summer I took a katamaran and my destiny was towards Hvar, the island.\nIn this\
  \ place I was totally surprised of everything!\nA summer that felt like a year!\
  \ In Paradise! turquoise waters, sunsets like a photoghraph, beautiful nature!\n\
  \nWell, the thing was that you had to live, sooo I ended up working as a kitchen\
  \ porter, on the most top island in Croatia.\n\nFor four months, my transport was\
  \ a boat (which looked like it was taking us to the Azkaban prison)\nand my day\
  \ was spent washing dishes, glasses and watching the sea.\n\nIn the mornings we\
  \ drank coffee, anywhere in the world a coffee is something quick,\nin Croatia it's\
  \ takes like 3 hours, drinking\nand talking a coffee it's a national sport. (and\
  \ that sport always made boss angry!)\n\n5 -6 hours a day, just to clean, my mom\
  \ would be proud, hahahaha !.\n\nThe envy gave me to stick my nose out, and see\
  \ people enjoying the sun and relaxation.\nWe worked without days off, so my tourist\
  \ envy increased, and made me think even more about my next\nHoliday destination!\n\
  \nAfter my workday, I went the faster as i can to the rocks, to throw myself to\
  \ swim in the arms of the Adriatic \nand after that, I usualy went to the roof of\
  \ a house, to watch the sunset.\n\nIt ended that tortuous summer, and my passport\
  \ soul wanted to continue the journey.\nI went through all the Dalmatian area, until\
  \ I reached the cradle of Game of Thrones!\n\nCroatia, she was my friend, and she\
  \ invited me to travel more, so the next step was to assemble the suitcase and get\
  \ to know Europe.\nSo many tours, stories and people, I do not reach in these 700\
  \ words."
