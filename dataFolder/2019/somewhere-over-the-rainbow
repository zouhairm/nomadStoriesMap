Text: "It was just supposed to be a Tinder date. But I couldn't imagine I would get\
  \ to a meeting on the middle of a forest in Portugal's mountains. The meeting has\
  \ a name and it is called \"the rainbow gathering\".\n\nAn ordinary thursday. We\
  \ just had match. I asked her for drinking some coffee but she couldn't make it\
  \ because of a camp event on the next day. So, even uninvited, I asked politely\
  \ if I could go because what else I would do? \n\nShe called, unbelieved that I\
  \ was really asking for it. She explained to me that wasn't an usual camping place:\
  \ \"You don't have to pay to stay there, all the meals are vegetarian, you can't\
  \ drink alcoholic drinks and it is judgemental free\".\n\nDouble match!\n\nTough\
  \ I didn't have anything of the must necessary accessories for camping, kindly,\
  \ my czech friend lend me a sleeping bag, my italian flatmate had a tent and utterly\
  \ on that week I had borrowed a bike from a portuguese friend, so I took the mini\
  \ safety flashlight in the bike's handlebar. Lucky me, checklist done in less than\
  \ 6 hours.\n\nNext morning, backpack, bus station, tinder match, tickets and road.\
  \ Then, trees, river and no photos allowed.\n\nUs around the food, mountains around\
  \ us. At least hundred individuals from many countries giving hands and making a\
  \ huge circle around the food to sing, to dance and to be thankful. Singing songs\
  \ about love, spirit and gratefulness.\n\nFor those who pursue a life with meaning:\
  \ rainbow is the connecting element between heaven and earth. And in that only 3\
  \ days that I luckily stayed there, I could see the reason why it is called the\
  \ rainbow gathering. \n\nNo doubt it was better than just a cup of coffee."
