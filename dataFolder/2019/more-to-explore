Text: This is a place called saputara near silvasa in gujarat . It is kind of hill
  station in small budget with all its beauty in hills . I spent my whole day there
  in regret to visit some hill stations with snow . But in evening the sunset point
  maked me realize everything has its own reason to be you just have to explore it
  was a beautiful sun was falling down from the valleys of saputara ,sky was a bit
  of yellow and everything orange and the waves were so soft with a fresh smell in
  it. I was remembering whole day it was worthful the time i lended there was 8 i
  had breakfast in the hotel near lake was waiting for 10 am so that i can visit the
  museum of saputara it has all our ancient stories and things to make us realize
  the beauty of gujarat. After then i went to the aquarium near it. Aquarium was full
  of beautiful fishes ,snakes and some turtle . I love turtle . It was  2 of the afternoon
  we went for lunch in a dhaba they served gujarati thali it was yummy . There i realized
  why gujaratis are so sweet all their dishes have the sweetness of love in them.
  We went to the market where things like necklace, Braclets, anklets made from sea
  shells, pearls, colourful stones, and lots of beautiful nature things were sold,
  i bought lots of things from there for everyone. We went to the park near the lake
  with some fun rides in it . But i was all in mood to sit near the lake i don't remember
  why still it was peaceful. We went to the sunset point. There i tried paragliding
  for first time in my life it was so hard for me to jump but i was having trained
  person behind me to it was the awesome experience of my life i will never forget
  that.
