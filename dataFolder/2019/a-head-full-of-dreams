Text: "Never had I traveled before without being under an adult's supervision. It\
  \ was 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, just me and my friend, two 21-years-old girls unraveling\
  \ the \"wonderful city\". \nThe reason why I planned that trip was because I wanted\
  \ to see Coldplay live, so as a proper fangirl I traveled about 1832 kilometers\
  \ to attend their concert. All I knew about Rio de Janeiro was what I watched on\
  \ TV, like its beautiful sights and its high violence rate. As a tourism student,\
  \ I was really excited to see what the city had to offer, as a regular citizen I\
  \ was kind of worried about my safety, but by the time I got there and started visiting\
  \ different places I didn't expect to find myself so in love with the city. I've\
  \ never felt so carefree and safe while walking in the streets, I thought I'd be\
  \ stuck in traffic most of times cause the city is so populous, but not once had\
  \ I have difficulties to get to others places, except that one time I got lost and\
  \ almost ended up in a favela - that was sort of terrifying. \nOn the first day\
  \ I went to visit the most famous place in Rio: Christ the Redeemer. It's amazing\
  \ how you can see the statue from pretty much every where in the city, but curiously,\
  \ the closer I got the more I thought that it seemed bigger only when you're far\
  \ from it. I was more mesmerized about the view your get from the top than the Christ\
  \ itself, I mean, it\u2019s a very impressive construction, but looking at the city\
  \ from above it makes you feel so small and at the same time very self conscious.\n\
  Then I went to visit Lapa which is a \"bohemian neighbourhood\", that when translated\
  \ to real life means \"streets full of drunk preople at any time of the day\". I\
  \ had no idea what that region was like, all I knew was that Snopp Dogg and Pharrell\
  \ Williams had filmed a music video there once and now I was trying to find that\
  \ particular place. As you can see by now I'm the type of traveler who is very influenced\
  \ by music, so imagine my surprise when I get there and find myself surrounded by\
  \ people screaming and stumbling all over the place at 9 am. Nevertheless the place\
  \ has its charm. The Selaron Steps is basicaly a stairway covered with many colorfull\
  \ tiles. If you're not used to exercise, your legs may hurt a lot but once you get\
  \ on the top it makes everything worth it.\nThe next day I went to Copacabana beach\
  \ and while walking on its soft and warm sand I noticed a cluster of people in front\
  \ of Copacabana Palace Hotel, a very famous hotel in the city, so I decided to go\
  \ there to see what was happening, and to my surprise there was Coldplay's drummer\
  \ in all his glory, something that never in a million years I expected to happen.\
  \ The other day I went to the concert and was lucky enough to get to be in the front\
  \ row. The show was in Macaran\xE3 Stadium and it was such a unexpected experience,\
  \ because I was used to see the stadium on TV in football matchs, with its green\
  \ grass and ball rolling from one side to the other, but that day the grass was\
  \ covered and the field was very crowded. From where I was standing, it seemed more\
  \ exciting than the world cup final.\nWhile I was in the taxi making my way to the\
  \ airport, I was thinking about how I pictured the city on my mind and how different\
  \ it turned out to be. You can visit a place through Google Maps or Instagram as\
  \ much as you like, but when you\u2019re actually there it\u2019s an indescribable\
  \ feeling. Traveling is magical and it changes your life. It changed mine, and the\
  \ only thing that remains the same is the longing to return to the city where I\
  \ unexpectedly left my heart forever."
