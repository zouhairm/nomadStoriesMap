Text: "Before going to Jerusalem, I had an image in my head of the city. In my mind,\
  \ it was so religious that its people should be serious, reverent, or any other\
  \ adjective that denoted introspection. Add to that the political situation and\
  \ the battle for the city, and here we go: fun is not something I was expecting.\n\
  \nI stayed in an AirBnB with an amazing and friendly female host. She was so outgoing\
  \ and communicative that I even forgot that we had different religious (I am a Christian\
  \ and she is Jewish). We talked about many subjects, from food to politics.\nIn\
  \ my last week staying there, she invited me to have lunch with her family, that\
  \ was coming over on that Saturday. So, it meant Shabbat lunch.\nI have to be honest,\
  \ I didn't know what to expect. She told me her family was more traditional, but\
  \ she didn't say they were Orthodox Jews.\nI feared for my life!!! I thought they\
  \ were going to be prejudicial and mean...\n\nWhen they arrived, though, I couldn't\
  \ be more comfortable. They made everything they could to make me feel safe, we\
  \ played cards, we talked about the foods from our countries, their business etc.\
  \  During the rituals of the Shabbat, they explained me all the rituals. I could\
  \ see with this that our differences paled in comparison to our similarities. I\
  \ could recognized excerpts of the Psalms in their songs, and I even risked singing\
  \ a little in Hebrew!\n\nAnd the food... OMG! Everything was so delicious! I really\
  \ loved hummus, schnitzel and all the other dishes they made. I also loved learning\
  \ about the meaning of every meal course, and the symbolism that surrounds Israeli\
  \ culture and Jewish culture.\n\nWow! That was unexpected! At the end of the lunch\
  \ I was playing on the flood with the kids, I was inviting them to go to Brazil,\
  \ and also praying with them for peace in Jerusalem. \n\nThat afternoon is a day\
  \ I will never forget. It changed my worldview and the way I see other religions\
  \ forever. I want to always be openhearted to people of all backgrounds and religions.\
  \ And, like that Orthodox Jewish family, embrace what is different showing love\
  \ and understanding."
