Text: "As the winter creeps up in the town of Bishnupur, known for Terracotta temples\
  \ and Baluchari Sari, it brings the gift of joy and lasting happiness. This is the\
  \ end of the agricultural season; the land is ceremonious and people are ready to\
  \ drown in the sublime exultation of festivities. It is the time of Pous Mela also\
  \ known as Bishnupur Mela. The town is tickling pink anticipating melody and lustre\
  \ of the coming days. For the first time in the long and eleutheromaniac history\
  \ of my travel, I was numinous to witness or more accurately to breathe inside a\
  \ perfect blend of art, culture, and heritage.\n \nDuring the last days of the waning\
  \ year, the time in the city of temples, indeed, is suave. It is full of artistic\
  \ brilliance, colours, craziness, and metaphors. Yes, Metaphors; that's how beauty\
  \ reify itself and gives birth to emotions and this place is paddling through a\
  \ lot of emotions. It both intoxicates and fills you with thrill. The city moves\
  \ peripatetically round the clock.. Awnings have been raised; the sky has been canvased\
  \ with mini colourful lights; the streets are filled with fragrances; loudspeakers\
  \ are weaving cold breeze into harmony, all hearts are wriggling; Boys with pointed\
  \ beards and girls with large earrings are prone to fall for the most primitive\
  \ and the most beautiful emotion know to mankind.\n \nBig Bengali eyes are wandering\
  \ faces with mischief and smile.\nAs I was lured, It is indeed the season of romance.\n\
  \ \nI reached Bishnupur on the night of 21st December and the Mela was to start\
  \ from 23rd. My proclivity to wander without purpose and capture anything and everything\
  \ in phone propelled me to do what I do best, walk the streets. I set foot on the\
  \ street and took long walks to every corner of the town. To my surprise, most of\
  \ the houses are painted in bold colours; Dark Green, Bright Yellow, Blue, and Red.\
  \ First thing I learned is that people, here,  are not afraid of boldness and certainly\
  \ know how to apply their ingenuity.\n \nOn 23rd, Mela started with a Padyatra led\
  \ by girls and boys clad in traditional attires. Other people were participating\
  \ in the Yatra dressed as Santa Clause, bears, horses, elephants, and other creatures.\
  \  \nAfter the long march, I dived into throng from one end to other. Inside this\
  \ whisk of art and heritage, there were famous Baluchari sarees, finest Linens from\
  \ Nadipar Districts, terracotta horses, beautifully carved wooden utensils, flower\
  \ vase made of bark, colourful bangles, spine-chilling carousels, folk artists,\
  \ a fashion show especially curated around local products, singers and dancers assiduous\
  \ in their performances, and, beautiful men and women from nearby villages. Every\
  \ village, age, gender, class, language, emotion, and craft within a radius of 100\
  \ Kilometers was present. \n \nover the next week, the days were busy shopping,\
  \ eating and riding carousels; and the nights were basked in the heat of music and\
  \ dance. I cannot recall every performance. But, the two which absorbed me most,\
  \ were, a performance on \u2018R D Burman Music\u2019 by original R D Burman musicians\
  \ and a classical by the artists of Local \u2018Bishnupur Gharana\u2019.\n \nWhen\
  \ I was at rehearsal ground on the preparation day, I had a conversation with a\
  \ mystic. He worships Krishna and appeared at peace. No, there was no halo but an\
  \ unusual calmness emanating from his face. He was there with around a dozen of\
  \ his followers and they had been singing Hare Rama Hare Krishna in different tunes.\n\
  To be honest, I was astounded, somebody could actually spend their life singing\
  \ these four lines and, at the same time, I was intrigued too, to learn more about\
  \ him. He apprehends my curiosity. With the assurance in his eyes, He said \u201C\
  It is not important what you do.\nWhat matters is how you do it and what makes you\
  \ do that.\nIt could be anything, it could be gazing at stars; looking at the moon;\
  \ swimming in an ocean, playing with children or falling in love; writing poetry;\
  \ traveling the world; anything that liberates you is an Art\u201D. \n \nIndeed,\n\
  An Instrument of your freedom is the true romance; is magic; is an Art."
