Text: "\u201CSomething was wrong up on cloud number nine,\u201D lamented Bryan Adams\
  \ through the Toyota Camry\u2019s staticky speakers, as a mass of white tents began\
  \ to interrupt the monotonous desert landscape. Hussein - our spunky, middle-aged\
  \ Jordanian cab driver - was still gloating over his victory in the most recent\
  \ round of the impromptu \u201Cname-that-artist\u201D game we had been playing,\
  \ delighted that his pop culture knowledge had outshone that of two westerners.\
  \ My boyfriend and I had spent half an hour negotiating this ride from Jerash to\
  \ Umm el-Jimal - an ancient settlement built entirely of black basalt, with over\
  \ 2000 years of Nabatean, Roman, and Byzantine history. \u201CYou want to go where?\u201D\
  \ he had exclaimed. His skepticism was justified: a stone\u2019s throw from the\
  \ Syrian border, the site was certainly off the typical tourist track.\n\nThe mood\
  \ in the cab had been amicable and lighthearted, as Hussein regaled us with amusing\
  \ anecdotes and shuffled through his curated playlist of 90s pop hits. I had mapped\
  \ the route earlier that morning and knew we would be passing by Zaatari, the world\u2019\
  s largest camp for Syrian refugees. As it began to sprawl before us, we instinctively\
  \ fell quiet. Snapshots of displaced people\u2019s improvised lives flashed before\
  \ my eyes: colourful laundry hanging out to dry, piles of empty water containers,\
  \ families wandering the dirt paths between seemingly infinite rows of white tents.\
  \ Zaatari has been called Jordan\u2019s newest city, and its novelty can be traced\
  \ to both its recent emergence as well as its unprecedented magnitude and character.\
  \ \n\nLess than five kilometres away from this teeming white city lies the uninhabited\
  \ black city of Umm el-Jimal. We were greeted by a shuttered ticket booth, a relic\
  \ of a more recent past when the site was flooded with tour groups. Beyond it was\
  \ an expanse of diverse basalt structures, the inky weatherbeaten stones glittering\
  \ in the late afternoon sunlight. There were no set paths through the ruins, nothing\
  \ was roped off, no guards monitored our every move. Each peek inside a window,\
  \ climb up a freestanding staircase, or step inside a house brought a new surprise.\
  \ The most thrilling was a massive slab door still perfectly on its hinges, which\
  \ could hypothetically, with some serious muscle, be swung open and closed. \n\n\
  Devoid of tourists, the site functions as a meeting spot for locals, among whom\
  \ our presence caused quite a sensation. A band of teenagers spiritedly herded us\
  \ into multiple sets of selfies. A trio of men out for a stroll offered to take\
  \ our picture in front of a lofty tower. As I handed one of them my phone, the other\
  \ two unexpectedly clustered beside us to be in the shot, leaving a respectful gap.\
  \ In one candid image, the younger man is bursting into a grin with his eyes closed;\
  \ his companion looks anxiously at the lens while adjusting his head scarf, as if\
  \ to say, \u201CNot yet!\u201D; my face, laughing in amusement, is turned toward\
  \ them both; and my boyfriend, who is almost never prepared for photographs, is\
  \ the only one smiling at the camera. \n\nReturning to the parking lot, we crossed\
  \ paths with American aid workers who were leading a family of Syrian refugees around\
  \ the site. Moved by the news reports of the Syrian crisis, they had left their\
  \ small town in the United States and moved to northern Jordan in order to volunteer.\
  \ As part of their work, they organized cultural excursions in the area, and Umm\
  \ el-Jimal was one of their regular stops. \u201CDid you find the door on its hinges?\u201D\
  \ they asked, as if sharing one of the site\u2019s precious secrets. While my boyfriend\
  \ and I were about to depart to spend one more night in the country\u2019s official\
  \ \u201CWhite City,\u201D the nickname for Amman, we knew that after their visit\
  \ the Syrian family would return indefinitely to the white tents of Zaatari. For\
  \ that moment, however, we were all under the spell of the bygone basalt city, encountering\
  \ a history that was not our own but that brought us together in mutual admiration\
  \ for the people who had once transformed this dusty plain into a place that earned\
  \ the epithet \u201Cthe Black Gem of the Desert.\u201D"
