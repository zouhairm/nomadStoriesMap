Text: "I have the Dutch nationality, live in Sweden but feel most at home in Indonesia.\
  \ My name is Margot and I will take you on a journey to the \u201Csavage\u201D island\
  \ of Borneo. As long as I can remember, I have had a passion for Indonesia and specifically\
  \ for Borneo. In 2013, I went on a trip to Java together with my parents and brother.\
  \ We did not go to Borneo, however, because my father thought it not suitable for\
  \ a 14 year-old. Maybe he was right, but he could have known that the island had\
  \ become a whole lot less \u201Csavage\u201D in those thirty years he had not visited\
  \ the place. When we decided to travel to Indonesia for a second time, I was convinced\
  \ we had to stay for a couple of nights on Borneo. After all, there is a reason\
  \ why my father has collected over 500 books about this island.\n\nIn the end, my\
  \ father agreed and we decided to book rooms at a small ecotourism guest house in\
  \ Palangkaraya, the capital city of Central Kalimantan. The staff was incredibly\
  \ friendly and we felt right at home. It was perfectly situated: in a kampong to\
  \ fully experience the Bornean lifestyle and yet close to all shops and amenities.\
  \ Furthermore, the owners had employed a gardener who had done a great job on creating\
  \ a jungle-like outside space.\n\nJungle. Yes, that was what we came for. \n\nOne\
  \ day we went to a woodworking factory founded by the owner of the guest house to\
  \ create jobs for the locals. A noble gesture but he had one problem: it was almost\
  \ impossible to get his hands on good-quality wood. In the end he even decided to\
  \ import it from other countries. One may wonder: how is this possible? After all,\
  \ Borneo is famous for its tropical rainforest. The answer to this question is of\
  \ course (illegal) logging. I dare to state that everybody knows about it, yet almost\
  \ no one knows its severity. \n\nMy father, who has done research on the environmental\
  \ history of the Indonesian part of the island, almost did not recognize his beloved\
  \ Kalimantan. It was no longer a wilderness where Mother Earth could play with nature;\
  \ instead it was a modernized society where globalization has had a major impact.\
  \ Asphalt roads everywhere and even the Pizza Hut had made its introduction (I cannot\
  \ deny that that was in a way a rather pleasant surprise). Clearly this society\
  \ was no longer \u201Csavage\u201D, but at what cost?\n\nWe wanted to see for ourselves\
  \ what was left of the tropical rainforest. Therefore, on our last day in Palangkaraya\
  \ we hired a guide whom would take is into a nature reserve. In a way, it was a\
  \ great experience. I mean we saw tons of monkeys and I mean monkeys are simply\
  \ awesome. Yet, at the same time it made me feel very sad and gloomy. Sad about\
  \ what we have done to our planet and gloomy about its future. If we humans do not\
  \ wake up soon, the world as we know it may be lost. Anyway, to get back to my trip\
  \ in the nature reserve: there was basically no primary tropical rainforest left.\
  \ The tree that came closest to that description had recently been cut down by illegal\
  \ loggers.  \n\nAll in all, my trip to Borneo has been an eye-opener to me. I did\
  \ not know that such a large share of the primary forest has disappeared. Getting\
  \ to know the Bornean culture and meeting new people was an amazing experience.\
  \ Yet, it also left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. However, I do have hope\
  \ for the future.\n\nI hope that we will be able to change our way of thinking about\
  \ climate regulations.\nI hope that politicians will get a wake-up call by all the\
  \ youths demonstrating for better climate politics.\nAnd I hope that, in a few centuries\
  \ time, the primary forest will be restored in its glory."
