Text: "I just got my December paycheque and I\u2019ve been saving for this trip for\
  \ 3 year and I\u2019am just a part-time student. Few years ago I saw on the magazine\
  \ that Vietnam was one of the cheapest places to visit and I saved up for it, let\
  \ me say I sacrificed everything for this trip. I\u2019ve never been on a plane\
  \ and probably I\u2019ll be the first one in this village to travel abroad on plane.\
  \ I got all my stuff as the whole village is outside my house like I\u2019ve just\
  \ came back home with an Olympic Medal, celebrating my success. But I don\u2019\
  t blame them it\u2019s a huge deal and I appreciate them for celebrating my success\
  \ with me. We are travelling on my uncle\u2019s bakkie from North West to Gauteng\
  \ Province usually it takes people 3hours max but it took us 5hours because of (obviously\
  \ reasons) this bakkie is just left with few weeks to give in. But I am glad that\
  \ we finally here, as my fancy aunt command me to take a shower, maybe that\u2019\
  s why she never visit us because we villagers and we don\u2019t bath 3 times a day.\
  \  Anyway but it\u2019s always good to be here, having a toilet in the house, eating\
  \ with fork and knife, I always knew this is the kind of life I was destined for\
  \ that\u2019s one of the reasons I have to go to Vietnam. It\u2019s around 5am and\
  \ I still cannot believe I am in OR Tambo international airport, my flight leaves\
  \ at 5:30 or should I say departure time. All I remember is me walking inside a\
  \ big white bird and sitting next to this guy with headphones. My hotel it\u2019\
  s not like the one\u2019s I saw on magazines but it has everything I need. I was\
  \ having my breakfast peacefully when a lady in a green top with heavy makeup interrupted\
  \ me. Her English wasn\u2019t as fluent as mine but at least I could understand\
  \ what she was saying, pity till this day I cannot pronounce her name but I know\
  \ she\u2019s from Switzerland. I wish somebody could\u2019ve prepared me for   this\
  \ foreignness, most people here don\u2019t speak English and where am from when\
  \ you speak English you\u2019ve made it in life, but thanks to my dear friend who\
  \ loves makeup because she seems to understand what these people are saying. I forgot\
  \ to tell you guys that I am allergic to most spices so I tend not to eat spices\
  \ at all, I love my greens. We were busy having dinner with my dear friend, her\
  \ boyfriend and some guy with lame jokes when my body started itching but since\
  \ it\u2019s a foreign country I thought my skin was just reacting to the weather\
  \ and then my lips started becoming heavy when I speak, all I after that is that\
  \ when woke up I was in hospital and a nurse beside me telling me in her broken\
  \ English that this was the severe allergic reaction they\u2019ve ever encountered.\
  \ And I will have to be deported this evening because my immune system is very weak\
  \ for their country/lifestyle, I couldn\u2019t believe my ears but that\u2019s what\
  \ she said. I was deported and the whole village didn\u2019t buy my story and they\
  \ told me it\u2019s fine if I didn\u2019t go to Vietnam nobody has been there so\
  \ I don\u2019t have to lie!"
