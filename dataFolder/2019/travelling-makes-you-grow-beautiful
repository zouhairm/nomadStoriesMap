Text: "Ladakh.. It's a place which hits the lists of every traveller and everyone\
  \ wants to go their atleast once.. We were very fortunate that got this chance so\
  \ early.. Yes in our 20's only.. Me and my four girlfriends who were planning this\
  \ long time back and it finally happened a few months back.. As we hit the land\
  \ \"yeahhh Leh\" .. We were in Leh pinching each other if it's already happened..\
  \ I'm writing this and getting goosebumps as if I went back to the first day when\
  \ we took the flight from Delhi to Leh and we all were so tensed if we're gonna\
  \ make this or not.. No no we were not  scared of any other thing but yes a blunder\
  \ we did while booking the tickets, my friend misspelled my name on the ticket and\
  \ it was totally sounding different from my original name',, lol.. The one way the\
  \ security is not going to stop is if they ignore it somehow and yesss it happened...\
  \ We all were murmuring our prayers \"jai mata Di\" and we almost screamed in our\
  \ hearts when he gave that expression of \"okay tested\" and I entered the airport.\n\
  Now going back to our first day.. Since it was a rest day as we needed to acclimatise\
  \ to the climate.. We took our first stroll to the Leh market, straight away went\
  \ to the ladakhi kitchen after little shopping of the souvenirs, though we were\
  \ smart enough that we didn't needed to ask where to go but enough smart to book\
  \ the tables and we were standing after putting the order though few gentlemen offered\
  \ us seats but because we were five\U0001F61C we refused it and took our momos and\
  \ local apple wine to our hotel and danced like bar girls to the fullest without\
  \ having wine because we were adviced not to consume alcohol as it dehydrates and\
  \ saved it for our last day...our second day was for Shanti stupa and local Leh..\
  \ In the midst of all this let me tell you that we be became very close to our driver\
  \ bhaiya(that's how we call it in India) Dg his name, a young cute short guy though\
  \ married but still cute and generous enough to be liked,must say that he added\
  \ flavours to our trip and made it hell rocking, if you ask me how then sorry can't\
  \ explain it.. You know sometime everything cannot be defined and expressed in words\
  \ that why writing is an art. If you talk about beauty then I must say Pangong lake\
  \ is so beautiful that it's beauty can only be felt, cannot be captured and can't\
  \ be expressed... But once lights turns off, yes actually electricity turns off\
  \ after 11 pm I  Pangong and after that actual beauty can be seen only though naked\
  \ eyes that blue water when shines like a diamond with moon light... Ohh man that's\
  \ hell beautiful.. Nubra valley is like a home covered with a ceiling of stars...\
  \ You feel like you are so close to stars that you can touch them.. In Nubra we\
  \ also saw three rainbows together and it is known that it brings good luck, we\
  \ started feeling even more special once we heard this(you know girls and when 5\
  \ are together) lol... I want to mention one thing that always travel, solo or together\
  \ but must travel whenever you can, group travelling gives you lots of fun and memories\
  \ to cherish whereas solo travelling help you grow beautiful so beautiful that you\
  \ are gonna love yourself all your life, you don't need any special one to make\
  \ you realise that you are special.\nAnd yes atlast we contributed and bought a\
  \ gift for our driver bhaiya he also to came to drop us airport and we also exchanged\
  \ numbers and we all promised that we'll soon come back, and I said that I'll come\
  \ on a bike trip with my fiance because earlier I planned this trip with him but\
  \ just because we were in the middle of buying a new bike we couldn't and as soon\
  \ I left for ladakh he bought a new bike.. So see you soon Ladakh \U0001F929\U0001F929"
