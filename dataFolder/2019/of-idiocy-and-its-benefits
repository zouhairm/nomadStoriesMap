Text: "In hindsight it wasn't the smartest decision to attempt a two day guided trek\
  \ up Mt Toubkal guideless in under 12 hours. It might have been in error to bring\
  \ just two water bottles to face the Mediterranean heat and physical exertion of\
  \ a 32km hike in the Atlas mountains. It probably wasn't a stroke of brilliance\
  \ to leave our travel lodge at 4:30am before morning light with just screenshots\
  \ of maps which gave my companion Sarah and I only vague ideas of where the trailhead\
  \ might be. However the benefits of idiocy are the beautiful moments you wouldn't\
  \ experience any other way.\n\n Fumbling around in predawn gloom we applied our\
  \ clothes, boots, and sack; collected our packed lunch which was lovingly prepared\
  \ by our host's mother the previous night, and brazenly stepped out into the clear\
  \ Moroccan morning. Being Canadian I was already a tad warm, Sarah an Australian,\
  \ a titch cold. The stars were still out as we made our way along the winding road\
  \ into the village of Imlil, and had just began to fade as we took a subsequent\
  \ windier road from there to a wide river valley, where allegedly the trailhead\
  \ lay hidden within. \n\n Finding the mountain path in a rocky, flat expanse before\
  \ light has reached the valley floor is easier said than done however. After several\
  \ sweeps back and forth across the valleys breadth (with no avail), we were saved\
  \ by divine intervention... Or rather we spotted a local and his pack-mule plotting\
  \ their way to the slopes on the eastern side, where the path evidently was. \n\
  \  \n The incline swiftly increased as we pushed ever upward into the Atlases. The\
  \ narrow track lead us along rivers, cliff sides, seemingly empty shelters, and\
  \ after sometime, past tiny collections of huts and homes populated by Berber inhabitants.\
  \ The rocks, rivers and villages had a blue-grey hue, until finally the sun crested\
  \ over the eastern peaks and struck the western slopes with angel rays that injected\
  \ vibrancy into the land as it came alive with the reds and yellows the range was\
  \ known for. The wonder of the moment caught me off guard, as the weight of where\
  \ I was, the company I was blessed to be there with, and the beauty I was witnessing\
  \ all crashed down on me.\n\n Then as if to balance out that gift from the divine,\
  \ the demonic had their say. Cutting through the ethereal moment an unearthly screech\
  \ pierced our ears and hearts. Banshees? Nazg\xFBl? Damned tortured souls released\
  \ from Hell? Nope. Just a benign herd of goats being shepherded through the pass\
  \ above us. This was ground zero for the ensuing silliness. The absurdity of the\
  \ noise coupled with our growing exhaustion and shrinking oxygen, meant every tiny\
  \ joke, mishap, and bit lead to uncontrollable fits of laughter.\n\n Even with knees\
  \ throbbing from tiredness and ribs aching from laughter, we continued to press\
  \ up the steep path. Soon we began meeting sensible, Prepared, guided, hikers coming\
  \ down from their multi-day accent. When we told them how far we had come and how\
  \ far we intended to go, they would politely inform us that it was not possible.\
  \ \u2018more fool you\u2019, thought us. \u2018more fool they\u2019, thought them.\n\
  \n Hours and giggle filled kilometres later we at last reached the refuge basecamp,\
  \ 4km and 1,000m elevation from the summit. Exhausted we lay in a meadow in the\
  \ shadow of a \u2018Batman Begins-esc\u2019 monastery and ate our lunch of hardboiled\
  \ eggs and canned tuna while mules grazed around us. We assessed our situation.\
  \ Despite our efforts the afternoon had worn away, Summit not included we still\
  \ had 15ish km back down the mountain to our lodge. It finally dawned on us what\
  \ we had idiotically set out to do was impossible. Better late than never. Yet as\
  \ we began our decent I felt no regret. The thrill of adventure, the stunning vistas,\
  \ and altitude sickness induced laughter, made the day beyond worth it. And indeed\
  \ foreshadowed the escapades to come for Sarah and I. Because at the end of the\
  \ day misadventures are the only adventures worth having... Well in hindsight any\
  \ way."
