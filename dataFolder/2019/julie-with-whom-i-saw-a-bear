Text: "When I arrived in a Jasper bar to meet my old hiking buddy, I had not seen\
  \ a bear. I told Julie I didn\u2019t believe in bears, that I was convinced the\
  \ Canadians created this conspiracy of mythical animals to boost tourism. She laughed,\
  \ but seemed a little offended. A couple at a neighbouring table protested and the\
  \ woman showed me a grainy photo of a bear outside her kitchen window. I said it\
  \ looked like her boyfriend in a bear suit, and they both seemed offended.\n\nI\
  \ was not afraid of bears. Being mammalian, they seemed reasonable. I felt if I\
  \ met a bear we could just make it work, like communicating with a dog. Not like\
  \ reptiles. Snakes are unreasonable and hide under leaves and then kill you when\
  \ you step on them.\n\nThe next morning we took our hangovers in search of coffee.\
  \ Julie asked the barista at a hipster cafe where we could get \u201Ca nice greasy\
  \ breakfast.\u201D\n\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t know,\u201D the barista replied.  \u201C\
  I\u2019ve never had a greasy breakfast. I only eat good breakfasts.\u201D And she\
  \ smiled at us with her mouth but not her eyes, and laughed with her mouth but not\
  \ her soul. We went to the grocery store for lunch supplies and asked the cashier\
  \ the same question.\_\n\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t eat junk.\u201D\
  \n\nIt was time to leave this cesspit of nutritional sanctity so we drove out of\
  \ Jasper to hike a magnificent mountain. We were chatting noisily about why I\u2019\
  d never been to Paris when there was a loud rustle in a thicket next to the path.\
  \ We froze. Directly in my line of sight, perhaps ten feet away, a large, black,\
  \ hairy, fleshly, decidedly bearlike bear looked back at me.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s\
  \ a bear.\u201D I said stupidly.\n\nJulie grabbed my arm and walked us away, talking\
  \ loudly. \u201CSO WITH BEARS YOU WANT TO WALK AWAY QUICKLY BUT CALMLY AND TALK\
  \ LOUDLY ARE YOU SURE IT WAS A BEAR OH MY GOD YEAH SO PARIS CRAZY OH MY GOD WE SAW\
  \ A BEAR.\u201D\n\nI chimed in idiotically from time to time, \u201CIT WAS A BEAR.\u201D\
  \n\nAs we calmed down I described the bear repeatedly, as though Julie hadn\u2019\
  t been there, and she listened graciously. \u201CIt was black and looking right\
  \ at me and its right arm? Paw? Was up by it\u2019s face with that expression and\
  \ my goodness it was a bear right there. Black bears climb trees? It\u2019s with\
  \ grizzlies that you play dead right? Ok.\u201D\_\n\nAs part of our civic duty we\
  \ called the Forest Service. \n\n\u201CWe saw a bear,\u201D we informed them with\
  \ great ceremony. They were appropriately Jasperesque and unimpressed.\n\nWe ate\
  \ North American sized steaks for dinner, and started in on the harder topics that\
  \ a genuine bear sighting will inevitably unleash. Relationships, illness, politics,\
  \ loss, family, religion. Then we drank another bottle of wine and talked about\
  \ how we\u2019d seen a bear.\n\nThe next day we procured some greasy breakfast,\
  \ because now we knew where, and said goodbye.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t*\t*\t*\n\nA year\
  \ later I met JulieWithWhomISawABear in southern Alberta to undertake one of National\
  \ Geographic\u2019s \u201CMost Thrilling Hikes,\u201D the Crypt Lake Trail. I was\
  \ following Julie along the path by a rushing river when she abruptly swung around\
  \ and walked back towards me with her \u201Cit\u2019s a bear,\u201D face. I back\
  \ pedalled and fell over. Behind her scurrying legs I saw the glistening brown back\
  \ of a beautiful, big, wet, warm mammal, rolling away from us down the path. I lay\
  \ on the ground, reconsidering whether or not I was afraid of bears.\n\nSuddenly\
  \ a smaller bear burst out of the bushes just behind Julie and pelted after the\
  \ first one.\_My features morphed into the \"it's another bear,\u201D face, and\
  \ we both fell a bit further back up the trail. We were adequately thrilled.\n\n\
  \"Julie,\" I said, in the bar that night, \"How many bears have you seen while hiking?\u201D\
  \n\"Two.\"\n\"How much Canadian hiking have you done?\"\n\"Lots.\"\n\"Something\
  \ weird is going on.\"\n\nWe agreed that there was a cosmic, bear attracting force\
  \ that manifested when we hiked together and that we could never do it again in\
  \ case we didn't see a bear."
