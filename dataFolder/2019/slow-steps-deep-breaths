Text: "November 23rd, 2016. Location \u2013 K\xF6ln, Germany. \nMy name is Amanda,\
  \ and at the time of this trip, I was 20. More than two years have passed, but the\
  \ imprint that this journey left on me has stayed. It isn\u2019t being dramatic\
  \ to say that it changed me as a person. When I left for the trip, I was riddled\
  \ with anxiety. I\u2019d travelled before, but never alone. I was going to be staying\
  \ in a complete stranger\u2019s spare room, travelling to a country where I didn\u2019\
  t speak the language, with no one to look out for me, or rescue me if things went\
  \ awry. I couldn\u2019t remember the reason I had wanted to go so badly. I was triple\
  \ checking that I had my passport, my bag, my money, my keys. Anything. Everything\
  \ the voice in my head told me was going to keep me safe, or save me from the inevitable\
  \ kidnap, mugging, and/or assault that was going to happen.\n\nFive hours later,\
  \ my phone was switched off, my family and friends had no way of contacting me.\
  \ I left my Airbnb, detached from the world I had lived in up until that point,\
  \ as easily as though I was shedding a heavy coat. \n\nHave you ever come in from\
  \ the rain, (I mean, torrential, bucketing down rain) peeled off your clothes and\
  \ sank into a hot bath? It\u2019s not just the removal of wet clothes, or the hot\
  \ water washing over your skin \u2013 there\u2019s a real psychological effect.\
  \ It\u2019s just you, alone in the hot water and the silence, while outside the\
  \ force of nature prevails. You\u2019re in a bubble, safe, warm, in control of your\
  \ environment. You can get up anytime you like, and dry yourself off. You can experience\
  \ the rain, without the ramifications of getting wet. That\u2019s what it was like,\
  \ the moment I stepped out of the little apartment, onto the little cobbled streets.\
  \ I realised that, even though it was dark, even though I was in a foreign country\
  \ and alone, I didn\u2019t have to be afraid. I was invisible \u2013 almost like,\
  \ the moment I stepped off the plane, I was handed this superpower. I was just another\
  \ tourist \u2013 no \u2013 not even that noticeable, just a blur in the background\
  \ of the crowd\u2019s background. I felt this overwhelming sense of relief, and\
  \ safety. Nothing was going to happen to me because this world was big, and I was\
  \ small and indifferent to the lives revolving around me.  \n\nThe whole town was\
  \ lit up with Christmas lights; beautiful, tiny gold specks of light that reflected\
  \ the new-found glow inside of me. There was a literal hum inside my bones. I couldn\u2019\
  t remember ever feeling this excited about anything before. I spent three days in\
  \ total in Germany, and by the 2nd day, I had ceased to speak unless absolutely\
  \ necessary. I completely submerged myself into this new place, and allowed myself\
  \ to become as a wallflower \u2013 observing in every way, but interacting as little\
  \ as possible. It was though I had found myself standing in the most beautiful lake,\
  \ and I was holding my breath, hesitant to move and disturb the peace and the lives\
  \ surrounding me. I became less than a face in the crowd, with my scarf wrapped\
  \ around my neck and mouth, and my hat on my head.  All my other senses had lit\
  \ up \u2013 colours, sounds and smells I had never experienced before, infiltrated\
  \ my brain \u2013 bright red market cabins, hot, mulled wine, the loud and circumambient\
  \ chatter, disguised by different dialects and languages \u2013 it was surreal.\
  \ I walked through the markets, breathing it in, feeling all at once, as though\
  \ I had both become invisible to the world, and found my place in it. \n\nOn the\
  \ final day, I checked my phone again \u2013 still powered off. I resisted the temptation\
  \ to turn it on and just check. I left my packed bag inside the apartment to be\
  \ collected before my flight. I went down the stairs, opened the wooden door and\
  \ took a deep breath of cold, German air. One last day into the unknown."
