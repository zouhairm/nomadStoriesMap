Text: "I was far. \nI woke up extremely early for an experience that I could never\
  \ know that would be the most remarkable one in my life. \nI was still far, but\
  \ a bit closer, fighting against my sleepness while packing the tents and while\
  \ on the truck through Namibian Desert towards a Dune to climb. \nThis dune is called\
  \ Dune 45. Welcome.\nSo, there I was, even a bit closer now, staring at the greatest\
  \ beauty ever seen. A mountain of sand sustained by the wind provoking me, whispering\
  \ in my ears voices of strenght.\nConvinced by the whispers  I started my walk...\
  \ Way harder than I thought it would be, feeling like a winner after each step closer\
  \ to the top and enjoying the wind pushing me up (so I wish, the wind was actually\
  \ on the opposite direction).\nBut then, step by step, I was finally there. On the\
  \ top. And I saw the most beautiful view and the most beautiful sunrise that I could\
  \ possibly see in my life.\nThe light of the sun turning the dark sky to a cristal\
  \ blue and the yellow sand to a vibrant orange made the landscape a piece of art\
  \ to memorize and enjoy every second, because you can\xB4t find it in a museum.\
  \ You can only find it in your heart.\nBut it was not over. The desert always has\
  \ surprises, and among all that, where you can see nothing but sand, life pops up.\
  \ Two trees were bravely standing there, green and smily, fighting together and\
  \ being happy together.\nI wondered how nature could be this powerful and how I\
  \ felt so tiny, but also so honoured to  be there, seeing and feeling all that wilderness\
  \ that Africa, but specially that moment and place, allowed me to feel.\nI connected\
  \ with a side of my own that we tend to ignore or even deny, our wildness. The wolves\
  \ that live inside us.\nWhile absorbing all my eyes could see I felt incredibly\
  \ part of that all even though I knew that if I were that tree, I would certainly\
  \ be dead by now. Desert is not for playing.\nAnd that was when I started my way\
  \ back to the bottom looking forward to a great breakfast.  But then, distracting\
  \ me from my thoughts, Dune 45 gave me its last show. While going down, the sand\
  \ moved along with my feet and legs, looking like I was floating.\nIt also felt\
  \ kind like it. It was extremely soft and it was actually quite easy to lose control\
  \ of the movements if you went to fast. For a moment I felt like it would happen\
  \ so that I began to wonder if the dune would take me back up to the top after a\
  \ while, just as I was told that it does: if anything falls down the dune, you wait\
  \ and it will bring it back to you, because the sand is pushed up by the wind.\n\
  Well, I guess I would probably just stand on the bottom forever. I am not made of\
  \ sand.\nBut, thoughts gone and smile on the face, feeling like Jesus on the water,\
  \ I made it safely to the bottom to join the rest of my truck travelling group for\
  \ a deserved breakfast before going to the next adventure.\nFinally, when saying\
  \ the last goodbye to Dune 45, I realised I was far when I first woke up that morning.\
  \ And now? Well, now I am always there."
