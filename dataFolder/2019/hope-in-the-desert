Text: "\u201CCover your face! Cover your face!\u201D a bearded man wearing a traditional\
  \ white dress called thobe and matching headscarf shouted at me as I entered the\
  \ bus while I took the lower part my scarf and hastily tried to cover my face as\
  \ I possibly can. I find myself relax as I took a seat on the third row of the vehicle.\
  \ I sat there, bewildered. I\u2019ve been here for a year, yet it still surprises\
  \ me how different the culture is. \n\nIt\u2019s a warm August in the quiet city\
  \ of Hail located in the northwestern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A desert\
  \ city but it\u2019s peaceful and people lived a simple life. However, they still\
  \ have their ways that I find traditional. Like when I get stared at because my\
  \ face isn\u2019t covered, or how I\u2019m seated in the family section of the bus\
  \ going to Riyadh since most places here are sex-segregated. As I wait for the bus\
  \ to leave, I looked around me and saw several guys seated at the far back of the\
  \ bus, opposite to my right side is a family, and behind me are two ladies busy\
  \ talking in Arabic.\n\nI mentally prepared for the long ride \u2013 roughly five\
  \ hours from Hail to Riyadh. The bus started to move and drove past the barren roads\
  \ towards the outskirts of the city and I fell asleep as I watched the view of the\
  \ plain desert. After about two hours, I was awoken by the sound of passengers getting\
  \ off the bus when we stopped by the city of Qassim.\n\nThen a girl hovered beside\
  \ me and looked at me. She was wearing the same clothes worn by most girls here;\
  \ black Abaya, hair covered with a scarf, and face covered with niqab. \u201CIs\
  \ this seat taken?\u201D she asked. I told her no, and she sat beside me. She looks\
  \ like she is traveling alone, which is quite unusual for Saudi women. We sat there\
  \ silently as the bus starts to move again. \n\n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\
  \ she asked as she started a conversation. \n\u201CPhilippines. Are you Saudi?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\u201CYour English is really good\u201D\n\u201CThanks\u201D\
  \ I saw her eyes smile as she explained that she studied abroad in the US and she\
  \ just came back to the country four months ago. \n\nI found myself interested in\
  \ her story. I know that the kingdom gives out scholarships for students to learn\
  \ about ways to reform the systems and that they are expected to transfer and apply\
  \ that knowledge when they return home. But as she shares her experience, she tells\
  \ me that it\u2019s easier said than done. \n\n\u201CI\u2019m having reverse culture\
  \ shock. People in my city is still hesitant to change but I\u2019m traveling to\
  \ Riyadh to look for work.\u201D We continued chatting for hours about the recent\
  \ changes like the 'women to drive movement', and allowing tourists, and more until\
  \ we entered the city of Riyadh. \n\nI stopped as I was amazed by tall buildings\
  \ and city lights. Everything looks so different. Just then, I looked at the lady\
  \ beside me and I saw her smile. She removed her face cover. \"They have a different\
  \ culture here\"\n\nTalking to her helped me understand the vision of the country\
  \ for their future. She gave me the feeling of hope despite a lot of its negative\
  \ preconceptions. Hearing her plans on how she wants to use what she learned made\
  \ me feel optimistic that things are going to change for good. I became at ease\
  \ knowing that the future of the country is in her hands, together with many Saudis\
  \ coming back home. \n\nThe bus came to a stop as we reached our destination. We\
  \ stood up, gathered our things, and exchanged our numbers as we bid goodbyes. \n\
  \n\u201CThank you. I had a great time. I wasn\u2019t bored at all. Message me anytime\
  \ you're in the city.\u201D\n\nLike an old friend, I hugged her and started to walk\
  \ away. Then, I smiled as I saw her name on my phone.\n\n\u201CAmal\u201D (Arabic\
  \ for hope)"
