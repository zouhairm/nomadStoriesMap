Text: "Power and beauty\n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find a waterfall greater than all\
  \ the waterfalls in Iceland, but I did.\nLast year I travelled to Puerto Iguaz\xFA\
  \ in Argentina, the southernmost country in South America and I was not prepared\
  \ for what I found. The land of silver has a lot to offer: Exotic plants, mammals\
  \ and birds, climate zones ranging from subtropical rain forests to a cold subarctic\
  \ terrain, beautiful wine regions, the Andes, the South Atlantic Ocean and big,\
  \ vibrating cities full of history, culture, music and food.\nBut the most impressive\
  \ place in Argentina was the Iguaz\xFA Falls \u201CLas cataratas del Iguaz\xFA\u201D\
  . Sharing a border with Paraguay and Brazil, the small town of Puerto Iguaz\xFA\
  \ is worth a visit itself. The tri-border region offers a lot of hotels and cozy\
  \ hostels to stay and makes a good starting point to explore the waterfalls. The\
  \ locals are friendly and helpful and you get to practice your Spanish and get the\
  \ best advice about how to plan your trip to the park. Everyone there will tell\
  \ you that the Argentinian side of the waterfalls is the \u201Cbetter\u201D one\
  \ and I\u2019d say they have the right to say this. If you however plan on visiting\
  \ the Falls on the Brazilian side as well, I\u2019d like to give you the advice\
  \ to do this first. You will definitely enjoy it more this way around. \nNo matter\
  \ how you choose, be prepared to be awed, once you finally make it to the majestic\
  \ Iguaz\xFA Falls. Embedded in a national park, stretching almost three kilometers\
  \ the Iguaz\xFA Falls are not for nothing named one of the seven Wonders of the\
  \ Natural World. They leave you speechless. Their beauty is only surpassed by their\
  \ power and I never caught myself simply staring at a natural sight the way I stared\
  \ at those waterfalls.\nIf you like suspense you should definitely explore all of\
  \ the Iguaz\xFA trails and leave the best part, the Devil\u2019s Throat (La Garganta\
  \ del Diablo), for last. There is a lot of wildlife to be seen in the park and if\
  \ you\u2019re lucky you can catch a glimpse of a predator or the biggest bird in\
  \ the Western Hemisphere, the Condor. I was so lucky as to see a Condor and a Toucan\
  \ in one remarkable day.\nAfter the forest trails I slowly made my way towards the\
  \ Falls. I started with the Lower Circuit and I was surprised, to put it mildly.\
  \ Every corner I turned I saw the waterfalls from a new and different angle. I saw\
  \ them from the bottom and about mid high until I finally reached the top. It is\
  \ spectacular to see how many waterfalls there are, all crushing down together,\
  \ showing us how powerful nature is and how small we are. The Upper Circuit took\
  \ me on a tour atop some of the waterfalls and if the lighting is right you can\
  \ see rainbows over the Falls. I did, which only added to an incredible experience.\n\
  Once I finished all the trails I took the little jungle train to get the highlight\
  \ of the day: The Devil\u2019s Throat. Reaching this viewpoint is nothing but exhilarating.\
  \ It is hard to put the feeling of being up there in words. You can see, feel, hear\
  \ and taste the power of the Iguaz\xFA Falls in this place. The immense rush of\
  \ adrenaline while standing still on a platform is unique. The water comes crushing\
  \ down in a semicircle and you cannot help but wonder where all these masses of\
  \ water come from. It is an absolutely invigorating feeling. \nAfter all these breathtaking\
  \ moments getting closer and closer to the Falls and walking on top of them, I did\
  \ not expect to find an even more spectacular place but the Devil\u2019s Throat\
  \ is just that. I highly recommend visiting this thrilling, beautiful piece of Argentina\
  \ that leaves every visitor fascinated, grateful and humble."
