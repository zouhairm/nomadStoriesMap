Text: "Once in Merida, also known as the white city, we rented a room in the colonial\
  \ style building called Hostal Zocalo, a colorful bed&breakfast in the pure heart\
  \ of the city, crawling with dozens of travellers from all over the world. The relaxed\
  \ atmosphere, the powerful light of the day that seemed to reach every hidden corner\
  \ of the sumptuous palace, the charms of the architectures and what happened a few\
  \ days after we arrived, made this place in the world one of our \u201Clugares en\
  \ el mundo\u201D garded in our hearts. \nMerida is the capital and largest city\
  \ in Yucatan state in Mexico, as well as the largest city of the Yucat\xE1n Peninsula.\
  \ \nM\xE9rida has the highest percentage of indigenous population within any large\
  \ city in Mexico (60 % Maya ethnicity) and luckily not every aspect of the pre-Columbian\
  \  culture has been lost. You can easily find some shops where you can learn how\
  \ the Maya people can weave agave fibers to create hammocks and panama hats! \n\
  But I\u2019m not here to sing the praises of Merida\u2019s shop, or restaurants\
  \ (despite the fact that I\u2019ve tried the best tortillas ever) or museums. I\u2019\
  m here to tell a true story. \nThe amazing Hostal Zocalo prides itself on organizing\
  \ day trips for 10-12 people in the charming lagoon of Celestun. Oscar, a Mexican\
  \ man with a great love for Mother Nature, picked us up with his van early in the\
  \ morning. We were a group of young men and women from Italy, U.s.a., Canada, and\
  \ Taiwan. We first visited the flamingos habitat, a long lagoon with sandy shades\
  \ in the morning light..so relaxing! Then we took a small boat and we went through\
  \ the mangroves to reach a deep blue cenote (a hole in the ground full of water,\
  \ fishes and antiquities) where we took a refreshing bath. \nAfter lunch (I mean:\
  \ after one of the most exquisite ceviche I\u2019ve ever eaten) we went to visit\
  \ a marsh, a sort of pool full of salt crystals. The day was ending and during this\
  \ exciting trip we started to know each other a little, and to fraternize. Oscar\
  \ explained us that the extremely salty water of the marsh was a panacea for the\
  \ skin and the body and invited us to submerge. \nSticking my feet into the hot\
  \ salt and feeling all the different temperature layers of the water was really\
  \ inviting. So I didn\u2019t think twice and I dived into this cloudy pool, followed\
  \ by my newlywed husband and all our new friends. \nOnly few minutes later, when\
  \ we were starting to relax, I realize the chilling truth: I\u2019d lost my wedding\
  \ ring! \nWe got married just two month earlier and the ring was my grandmother\u2019\
  s.. I was devastated. \nOne of the girls, Monica, took the matters into her hands\
  \ and started a grid search.. the hands sticked into the salt we were all crouched\
  \ down, rifling through the crystals.\nI didn\u2019t expect to see my granma\u2019\
  s ring again.. but I continued telling myself \u201CI can\u2019t lose it in my honeymoon\u201D\
  !\nSuddenly Monica drawed something from the water: it was the ring! My ring! Oh,\
  \ what a lucky day!! \nWe hugged each other in tears! My husband said: tonight Margarita\
  \ para todos!!! \nEvery time I turn my wedding ring in my fingers I think about\
  \ that day in Mexico, and I smile."
