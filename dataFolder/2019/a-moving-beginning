Text: "4:20 AM : the airport looks different at this hour - it feels different too.\
  \  \n\nOr perhaps, I am feeling different right now.  A mixture of emotions go through\
  \ me, however I look and remain calm. I blame this on the sleepless night characterised\
  \ by strange dreams such as the one where I arrived in the wrong accommodation and\
  \ the one where I took the wrong luggage and had to come back to Malta. I also blame\
  \ the caffeine fix that hasn\u2019t started working yet. However, despite the zombie-like\
  \ appearance that I hold, I am well aware of what is happening, of the time slowly\
  \ reaching the culminating moment where I\u2019m off to the unknown. \n4 months\
  \ in France.\nA Maltese alone, studying in a country much larger than this dot of\
  \ an island she lives on. A million questions are sprinting through my brain : what\
  \ if I miss the train that will take me to Angers?, what about all the documents\
  \ I still have to sign?, will I manage to settle there?, will I catch up with the\
  \ lectures ? \nBack in May I was jumping at the thought.  When we were told that\
  \ we could apply for Erasmus I didn\u2019t even think it twice and when the acceptance\
  \ letter arrived and I had to confirm, once again there were no second thoughts.\
  \  And after so many struggles, emails and going from one person to another, I was\
  \ making my way to the check-in desk, passport in hand. \n\u2018Bon voyage\u2019\
  \ the check-in attendant she says. I smile and not, still not surely believing that\
  \ the \u2018Jour J\u2019, as the French would call it is here.  I hug my parents\
  \ tightly and I can see they are trying not to cry but the tears are well welling-up\
  \ in their eyes.  \u2018Goodluck\u2019 they tell me \u2018and take care, be safe.\
  \  \u2018Message us when you arrive.\u2019   \nThis is it.  They watch me go through\
  \ the boarding pass control for the security control. As I climb the steps leading\
  \ to the departures gates, I take a last glimpse of my family waving at me from\
  \ the departure hall until finally I turn my back and see them no more. It\u2019\
  s time to jump into something totally new and unknown.  I uttered my first words\
  \ every since I opened my eyes that morning: \u2018Malta see you in 4 months.\u2019\
  \n\n\nBreathless. But I made it.  The moment of when I almost lost my train to Angers\
  \ because of a wrong track, is marked by the painful stitch on the left side of\
  \ my waist. I thanked the trains in France for only giving me 5 mins to find the\
  \ track written on the screen and therefore testing not only my alertness, but also\
  \ my fitness skills.  Never had I sprinted so much as when the young lady told me\
  \ that I had to cross to the hall and find the other track.  And with less than\
  \ one minute to spare, a frantic girl with a luggage twice her size could be seen\
  \ looking for her cabin.  Because why simply leap into the unknown when you can\
  \ sprint into it ? \nWorry number one was over.  The unknown was getting closer\
  \ and closer.  In 2 hours the unknown was going to become all the more familiar.\
  \  However, for now it was time to enjoy the rarity of being on a train and find\
  \ my lost breath again."
