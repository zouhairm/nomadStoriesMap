Text: "A breath, \u201Csigh..\u201D shallow as it sometimes seems to be, this was,\
  \ one deep tugging after air. Step, after step, so vast, so large. \nWalking towards\
  \ a goal, a dream\u2026 a mountain top. Kilimanjaro, the seventh day, the Sunday\
  \ of the week. \nWe are aiming to reach the peak, 5900 altitude meter above sea.\
  \ The air feels thin, thinner than usual. Never would I  believe that the reduction\
  \ of oxygen in the sky would be so painful to inhale and exhale, a world embedded\
  \ in ice.\nI haven\u2019t eaten for the past five hours because of those dreadful\
  \ bars. All I brought with me for consumption was the cheapest \u2018proteinbars\u2019\
  \ I could find on the internet..  but why, ugh? That\u2019s the only thought running\
  \ through my mind as I push forward in attempt to not complain, because complains\
  \ have a tendency to grow loud in the shortest amount of time when you are resolved\
  \ in complete suffering through physical exertion. \n\u201CJonas, Jonas.. \u201C\
  \ \nSomeone are speaking to me. I gaze up towards the voice in lead of the group\u2026\
  \ Did I just \u2018zone\u2019 out completely from my body and mind? How long have\
  \ it been, realizing that I had walked without the thought of being there. \u201C\
  yes\u201D I manage to mumble, half-asleep tired and weary after a long week.\n\u201C\
  Are you alright?\u201D Robin smiles back at me, his the leader of the expedition.\
  \ \n\u201CYes, yes.. I am fine.\u201D I smiled in disagreement of what I just said\
  \ \u2013 Exhausted... My eyes staring cold into the pitch black night, another step,\
  \ Breathe, Breathe. \nPerfect.\nRobin, had climbed Mount Everest at the age of 24.\
  \ During one dialogue earlier on the mountain ridge towards the last and highest\
  \ tent camp, had I questioned \u201CWhy mountaineering when it is absolutely dreadful?\u201D\
  \ for me; as a first timer among the roots and slippery stones. \u201Cwell, I tell\
  \ you what.. Jonas. If it is something I am good at that would be this. Walking\
  \ long hours with a pack hanging loosely on my back while pushing myself towards\
  \ a dream.\u201D\nIt made perfect sense. Surely he seemed to walk easily upon the\
  \ snow, friction-free and true? Maybe were it technique involved just to walk efficiently,\
  \ or had he prepared better than myself? Easily are it to blame that others - are\
  \ more talented, or lucky, or that it may be because of light feet\u2019s, but more\
  \ importantly is to recognize; he as I are human too. \nUnderstanding perfectly\
  \ fine, if he is human he should have limits as everyone else, and if he can walk\
  \ without effort and smile as well, then shalleth I be able to do the same? \nIs\
  \ it about the altitude or the actual attitude that difference, good and bad, easy\
  \ and hard?\n\nWe stopped for a short break, another leader wearing the same name\
  \ as I do says firmly \u201CTen minutes\u201D gazing at his clock then up upon the\
  \ stars.. \u2018. He had instructed us as a group; that if we want to get ourselves\
  \ alive up unto the roof of Africa. Must we understand and commit towards his plan\
  \ and that would be; walk for an hour then rest for ten-minutes before walking again.\
  \ \u2013 \u201Csince..\u201D said he \u201Cif we stop every time someone are tired,\
  \ we\u2019ll never get anywhere at all.\u201D \nDespite \u2018Pole, Pole\u2019 the\
  \ epigraph of Kilimanjaro translated into \u2018slowly, slowly\u2019 did we prioritize\
  \ progress instead of resting long hours just for the cause of weary legs combined\
  \ with the issue of various aches and pains..\nA woman calls for the leader.. \u2018\
  Jonas, Jonas\u2019 myself looking up hearing my birth given name but quickly realise\
  \ she is talking to the guide as a friend.. She is bleakly coloured in her face,\
  \ meekly green despite the white light of the moon.. before she turns around and\
  \ throws up. \nAre she crying? She talks quietly with the guide so silently that\
  \ rest of the group shouldn\u2019t hear as if it was a secret, but I could overhear\
  \ a few words.. \u201CI should probably turn back down\u2026\u201D. She wiped her\
  \ eyes with one big glove and looked back down towards the large mountain hill -\
  \ the sun hadn\u2019t even reached dawn yet."
