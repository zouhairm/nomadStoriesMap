Text: "A 250 Years Old Person is the collection of lectures and writings of the Ali\
  \ Khamenei. It consists of 17 chapters. It starts with the life of Mohammad and\
  \ ends with Hasan al-Askari, 11th Imam of Shia. The first three chapters are about\
  \ the social and political situation of the Islamic Community, from the Day of Ashura\
  \ to the spiritual leadership of Ja'far al-Sadiq. The main concepts of the book\
  \ are the lifestyle of Imams and their aims in life. The period of 250 years is\
  \ applied to the tenth lunar Hijri year (631 CE) until the Minor Occultation (874\
  \ CE).[3] According to this book, Mohammad the prophet and the twelve Imams apparently\
  \ had various methodologies in their lifestyles, but in whole they tried to reach\
  \ one aim.\n\nPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES\n\n\"In the areas of political and revolutionary\
  \ ideas and Islamic jurisprudence, I am certainly a disciple of Imam Khomeini\"\
  \ says Ayatollah Khamenei. He adds: \"Yet the very first sparks of consciousness\
  \ concerning Islamic, revolutionary ideas and the duty to fight the Shah's despotism\
  \ and his British supporters, was kindled in my soul at the age of 13 when the brave\
  \ cleric, Nawwab Safavi, later martyred by the Shah's regime, came to our school\
  \ in Mashhad in 1952 and delivered a fiery speech against the Shah's anti-Islamic\
  \ and devious policies.\" \nIt was in Qum in 1962, that Sayyed Ali joined the ranks\
  \ of the revolutionary followers of Imam Khomeini who opposed the pro-American,\
  \ anti-Islamic policies of the Shah's regime.\nDedicated and fearless, he followed\
  \ this path for the next 16 years which ultimately led to the downfall of the Shah's\
  \ brutal regime: persecution, torture, imprisonment and exile could not make him\
  \ waver for a moment.\n\nIn May of 1963 (corresponding to the holy month of Muharram),\
  \ Imam Khomeini honored the young, brave cleric Sayyed Ali, with the mission of\
  \ taking a secret message to Ayatollah Milani and other clergymen in Mashhad, on\
  \ the ways and tactics of exposing the true nature of the Shah's regime. He fulfilled\
  \ this mission properly and traveled to the city of Birjand for further propagation\
  \ of Imam Khomeini's views. Here he was arrested for the first time and spent one\
  \ night in jail. The following the authorities ordered him not to speak at the pulpit\
  \ again. From that moment he knew that he would be under police surveillance all\
  \ the time. Of course he did not submit to police threats, and as a result of his\
  \ activities relating to the bloody June 1963 Uprising (15th of Khordad ), he was\
  \ again arrested and transferred to Mashhad to spend ten days in prison under severe\
  \ conditions.\nIn January 1964 (Ramadhan 1383), according to a well-organized plan,\
  \ Ayatollah Khamenei and a few close friends traveled to Kirman and Zahedan in southern\
  \ Iran, to expose the phony referendum the Shah was holding for his so-called reforms.\
  \ There in the course of many public speeches, he exposed the satanic American policies\
  \ of the Pahlavi regime. This time, the Shah's feared intelligence agency, SAVAK,\
  \ stepped in and arrested him one late evening. He was taken to Tehran by an airplane\
  \ to spend two months in solitary confinement during which time he was tortured.\
  \ \nOnce freed, he started holding lessons on the exegeses of the Holy Quran, the\
  \ Prophetic Traditions and Islamic ideology in Mashhad and Tehran. These lessons\
  \ were most appreciated by the revolutionary Iranian youth. As he was sure now that\
  \ SAVAK was watching him closely, he was forced to go underground in 1967. However,\
  \ he was arrested again for holding such classes and Islamic discussions.\nAyatollah\
  \ Khamenei has himself explained the reasons for such measures by SAVAK: \n\"From\
  \ 1970 onwards, grounds for an armed movement were being laid out. Accordingly the\
  \ regime's sensitivity and severity of action against me increased. They could not\
  \ believe that the armed actions were not connected with a sound, Islamic ideology.\
  \ They thought that there must be links between these revolutionaries and people\
  \ like me because of my intellectual and diligent activities. Despite all this,\
  \ after I was released, more and more people attended my classes on the Holy Quran\
  \ and many were present at our clandestine gatherings.\""
