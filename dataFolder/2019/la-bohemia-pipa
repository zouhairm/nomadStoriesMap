Text: "In July 2017, I was in Recife carrying out an academic exchange program, city\
  \ located in the northeast of Brazil, constantly was going out to nearby beaches\
  \ with my fellow intercambistas, with the days we were creating a large group with\
  \ people of different countries, and together we decided to conduct a travel to\
  \ a place that for us it was confronted with a rather exotic, I'm talking about\
  \ Pipa, a tourist town located in Rio Grande do Norte, famous for its natural pools,\
  \ cliffs, sand dunes, and especially for their lively nightlife. Thursday, October\
  \ 12, we began our long awaited trip. When we arrived, and we started to walk the\
  \ streets of this city I began to feel immediately a spirit of freedom, the streets\
  \ were full of hostels and walls of colors, people smiling, wearing bathing suits\
  \ and with beers in their hands. After seeing this we just wanted to save everything\
  \ and leave immediately to begin our first day, the first place we visited was Praia\
  \ de PIPA, this beach is seen from a small plaza that has a balcony, it was a wonderful\
  \ day, and from there the sea could not be more blue, in addition to at first glance\
  \ we were also able to appreciate their natural pools, that was originally one of\
  \ our main attractions, after enjoying those pools, we headed to the Praia dos Golfinhos\
  \ (beach dolphin), we had found on the internet that with a bit of luck you could\
  \ spot dolphins. When we arrived, you quickly in the water to expect to have a little\
  \ bit of luck and he could see them, since I had never had the opportunity to see\
  \ some, and indeed it was a day with a lot of luck, after about 30 minutes of being\
  \ there I saw you jump two of them to my side, I could only scream wow! For me,\
  \ this day was already wonderful for having seen for the first time the dolphins.\
  \ When he was going to fall the evening we decided to go to the Chapadao, a place\
  \ known for being a large cliff with a privileged view to see the sunrise and the\
  \ sunset, we walked about an hour and when we arrived we realized that it had been\
  \ completely worth it and my day was made even better with the view of that sunset\
  \ unmatched for its clear blue sky with red orange and red that looked cerqu\xED\
  sima of us. Watching the sunset we came in the night and yet we were expected to\
  \ live another of its attractions: the lively night life in the Avenida Bahia dos\
  \ Golfinhos. Indeed, when we left the hostel it was impossible not to be infected\
  \ by the atmosphere, partying in the streets full of tourists, music and caipirinha.\
  \ The next day we visited the beaches of the east end of the city, we started from\
  \ the Praia do Madeiro, which is located underneath of a few small cliffs, from\
  \ where you can observe the sea with its beautiful colors and the beach full of\
  \ surfers and in the distance a few small sand dunes, which made this beach has\
  \ a unique essence. In the afternoon we went to Tibao do Sul, which is the original\
  \ name of this city, in this little corner can take walks in buggies, we rent some,\
  \ and as I love the adrenaline, for me, this was one of the best moments of this\
  \ trip, and while enjoyed the ride in buggy our sunset we surprised, it was a perfect\
  \ combination of a sun, rays oranges hiding in the white sand of the dunes that\
  \ were appreciated from afar. And so, the night came again, and obviously we wanted\
  \ to go out to enjoy in that place where the party seemed to end, as though all\
  \ the clubs and bars closed at 2:00, the evening continued on the beach to enjoy\
  \ the sunrise and so did the rhythm of the brazilian funk with a few caipirinhas\
  \ and the sound of the waves of the sea. And so come down an unforgettable trip\
  \ in the to my \u201CLa bohemia Pipa\u201D."
