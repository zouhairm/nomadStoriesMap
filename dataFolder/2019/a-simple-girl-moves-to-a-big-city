Text: "Amsterdam. \n\nCaptured my heart almost 10 years ago and still in awe at what\
  \ always seemed to me to be something from a storybook. Unreal. \n\nHow could there\
  \ be a city so cute and charming. So quirky. So pretty. \n\nBut it exists. \n\n\
  And today as I cycled around, I felt like a girl before her wedding day. \n\nCold\
  \ feet. \n\nI'm supposed to be a big girl now. Move to a bigger city. Bigger opportunities.\
  \ \n\nBut how I would miss my simple life. The comfort of this village. \n\nShould\
  \ I call it off? \nTell my company I'm just going to stay. \nTell my landlord I'm\
  \ keeping my room. \nTell my future husband that I'm just not ready? \n\nBut I know\
  \ that all the challenges I've faced in the past has prepared me for this. No one\
  \ is ever ready. But you learn to adapt. And with adapting, you grow. \n\nI know\
  \ that I can create a home anywhere. I just need to create my own little space to\
  \ relax, retreat, restore. A place of comfort. To nurture myself. \n\nThere is no\
  \ shortage of people in Paris. And I'm sure I can make a connection with a few.\
  \ A few to call my friends. To engage with. To share thoughts and understanding.\
  \ \n\nThere is so much beauty in Paris for me to wander about. To discover. To explore.\
  \ \n\nA home to retreat to. \nPeople I can connect with. \nAn inspiring, aesthetic\
  \ environment to live in and wander through.\n\nThat's all I need. I'm a simple\
  \ girl. \n\n\"It isn\u2019t the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it\u2019\
  s the pebble in your shoe.\""
