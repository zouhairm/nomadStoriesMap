Text: "I'd been dying to visit Europe for about 15 years and when the time finally\
  \ came, I almost didn't book the trip. Nick, my fiance, and I had been discussing\
  \ and dreaming the details for almost a year, and now here we finally were, about\
  \ to hit \u201CBook Now\u201D on our meticulously pieced together dream package--a\
  \ 12 day journey through Italy--and I felt a nauseating anxiety creeping up higher\
  \ and higher in my gut, practically screaming at me, \u201CDon't do it!\u201D My\
  \ mind raced with panic over just about everything. The long flight over the cold,\
  \ black Atlantic. The prospect of being the farthest from home I'd ever been, in\
  \ a different culture, an unknown place. The threat of a potentially imminent terrorist\
  \ attack that'd I'd been especially agonizing over since the moment I read it on\
  \ the Department of State website. The wiley pickpockets, which are apparently everywhere\
  \ in Italy. Panic gradually gave way to a moment of clarity, and I realized that\
  \ all of the little excuses I'd made up until this point for not visiting Europe\
  \ (money, timing, convenience) belied what was truly inhibiting me: my fear. And\
  \ in that moment the voice of screaming anxiety gave way to a gentler one. \u201C\
  Do it. You must.\u201D\n\nI try to hold on to that electric feeling we both had\
  \ when we landed in Rome; the buzz of total displacement and a lush 12 days of unrealized\
  \ adventure stretching before us. That mindspace where every little thing feels\
  \ magical and exciting, starting with the strange toilets we were blissful to be\
  \ using after the overnight, 8-hour flight, flushed using 2 buttons on the wall\
  \ instead of the familiar metal handle. Europe is SO neat, I giddily think as I\
  \ bounce out of the bagno and back to Nick. We already begin to feel well-grounded\
  \ and capable when we find a vending machine to buy some badly needed bottled waters\
  \ from, frizzante specifically, and successfully buy due biglietti on the Leonardo\
  \ Express to the Roma Termini. My rapture builds with the speed of the train, delighting\
  \ in the sights passing by that could belong to no other location on Earth: palm\
  \ trees drooping with scorched fronds, mysterious ruins that could be anywhere from\
  \ 500 to 2000 years old, smatters of vivid, gritty graffiti covering the sides of\
  \ pastel stucco apartment buildings. The mishmash of ancient and modern is nowhere\
  \ more prominent than this citt\xE1 eterna.\n\nWe arrive at the Hotel Regio to an\
  \ underwhelming room, outfitted with the stiffest mattress I've ever experienced\
  \ and a bathroom so small you have to climb over the bidet to reach the tub. But\
  \ it's very conveniently located near the Termini where we can pick up the metro\
  \ and the rest hardly matters. We throw open the windows and gape at the quintessential\
  \ Roman streetscape outside. Two tiny Fiats are parked below us, their bumpers nestled\
  \ right up against each other like old pals. We set out on our next and only mission\
  \ of the day: to explore as much as we can on foot, and to be sure to stay up until\
  \ at least 6 pm, hard as it may be. We wander aimlessly, marveling at the unknown\
  \ wonders before us, including one particularly imposing, ancient-looking edifice--standing\
  \ in uncanny contrast to the graffitied storefronts and zig-zagging Vespas we passed\
  \ just a block before it--which we ultimately discover to be the Terme di Diocleziano,\
  \ the Baths of Diocletian, built around 300 AD. We decide to head for the closest\
  \ block of green space on our map, the Villa Borghese, for a relaxing end to the\
  \ evening. The park is wild, lusty, and beautifully unkempt, like all of Rome. Nick\
  \ is particularly entranced by the tall, lush, otherworldly umbrella pines dotting\
  \ the landscape. We purchase an overpriced gelato and sit, watching happy families\
  \ and couples take their evening passeggiata. Nearby, a musician plays a familiar\
  \ tune on his guitar, \u201CShine on You Crazy Diamond.\u201D Though we are strangers\
  \ here, Rome and its people already feel like family. We soon begin the long walk\
  \ back to the Regio to rest and prepare for tomorrow\u2019s adventures. It\u2019\
  s past 6 pm. We\u2019ve made it."
