Text: 'I''m Agusti Ardiansyah Saputro, i live in Pasuruan, East Java, Indonesia. I
  live in Pasuruan since 20 years ago. Not often i found many stresses because many
  problems. Many diversities in here. But a few groups always got some violences.
  So, thats groups cann''t live calmly. For real example, i''m fans of Arema FC. Arema
  FC is one of football club in Indonesia. But Pasuruan communities are dislike Arema
  FC. They will attack all Arema FC Fanses. They also will kill Arema FC Fanses.


  In February 2018, i went to Jambi. This is my first time visit Sumatera. I think
  all cities in Indonesia have high intolerance. But this is not found in Jambi. This
  is outside of my expectation. Jambi is more tolerance and more peace than my city.
  Jambi''s communities didn''t look the background of other people. They never look
  what is his favourite, what is his religion, and where is his come from. Jambi communities
  accept all difference. A week in Jambi, i fell Jambi''s people because the communities
  is very kind. Not only that, Jambi also have many wonderful places. Jambi has Muaro
  Jambi Temple who has many history of kingdom in Indonesia. Jambi also has Seribu
  Tiang Mosquito who has a thousand poles. Jambi also has many food who recommend
  for culinary destination, one of all is Pempek Jambi. Pempek Jambi is very delicious
  and cheap. I have eaten many Pempek Jambis. But, i sadly because i only a week in
  Jambi, not forever. I hope i can visig Jambi again in other time.'
