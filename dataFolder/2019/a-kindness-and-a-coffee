Text: "\u201CTwo hundred dirham! Each. Now!\u201D the driver screamed suddenly, all\
  \ but spitting at me as a wad of bills were flung suddenly in my face & the driver\
  \ door slammed violently. Four of us sat in the car, stunned, for a few moments\
  \ more before he was suddenly back in the driver\u2019s seat and we were off, surging\
  \ away from the halogen island gas station, quickly outstripping what seemed to\
  \ be the last town in Morocco. \n\nTo the intrepid traveler this is beyond where\
  \ you don\u2019t want to be, it\u2019s the situation you live with constantly in\
  \ your mind so that you don\u2019t have to experience it in real life, or more specifically\
  \ somewhere along the Sahara in the middle of the night. You hear about it most\
  \ often from friends and loved ones before any departure to parts unknown: isn\u2019\
  t it dangerous? But do you know anyone there? What if you get into trouble? There\
  \ are many answers to these (valid) questions, but in this case it was the simple\
  \ & universal answer to most of life\u2019s questions, or at least that's how it\
  \ started: over coffee.\n\nTen hours north of Marrakech there is an old train station\
  \ with ceilings so high the pigeons are specks as they swoop through the open arched\
  \ windows facing the bristling metropolis of Fes, Morocco\u2019s spiritual center\
  \ and home to the world\u2019s oldest university. Being \u201Cin the wind\u201D\
  , as they say, I set my pack down at one of the country\u2019s most venerable and\
  \ ubiquitous institutions, the Moroccan cafe, and set about looking for accommodations\
  \ that night. A bastion of caffeine & wifi, a cafe will come in all shapes and sizes,\
  \ from upscale joints serving tiny bottles of water with your espresso to humble\
  \ affairs that at first glance look more like someone\u2019s living room with street\
  \ access. \n\nIn a hurry to find the cheapest hostel, I distractedly took a sip\
  \ of the water after the espresso, as is customary. Before even setting the glass\
  \ down a kind old face suddenly appears by my elbow, eyes twinkling & suffusing\
  \ the kind of goodwill that catapulted him straight past my con-man barriers. Crouching\
  \ at my side in this fashion he says \u201CExcuse me sir,\u201D pausing to let out\
  \ a giggle, \u201Cbut if I drink the water I will be fine, I have lived here my\
  \ whole life.\u201D This last delivered with a warm note of pride. \u201CBut if\
  \ you do\u201D he is all smiles \u201Cand I mean no offense, but you will have --\
  \ well, you\u2019ll not leave the bathroom for days!\u201D We both burst out laughing,\
  \ names exchanged and from there a chair is pulled, conversation flows. Abdel-hak,\
  \ or simply Abdul, calls out for two more nous nous, that sweet caffeinated elixir\
  \ taken when one wants a break from the rivers of fresh mint tea. Over the course\
  \ of the next two days Abdul kindly guides me through the labyrinthine medina, reveals\
  \ the best holes in the wall for fresh roasted sardines served over beds of coriander\
  \ and positively glows when we get to the Chouara Tannery, his home and sustenance\
  \ since he was orphaned at the age of 8.\n\nAs a parting kindness, Abdul helps me\
  \ get in touch with a tour company that provides trips to southern Merzouga, \u201C\
  Doorway to the Sahara\u201D. Being early February, the pass is snowed out and extends\
  \ an already long drive into a thirteen hour affair, putting myself and the three\
  \ other passengers squarely in the middle of nowhere with an irate driver. When\
  \ I hand the phone over to him I can clearly hear, if not comprehend, Abdul\u2019\
  s electric delivery in rapidfire Arabic. The car slows down, all monosyllabic responses\
  \ from our end of the phone and he hangs up. As we pull up to the hotel a short\
  \ while later and everyone  hurriedly piles out of the car the driver calls Abdul\
  \ again, handing the phone over to me and I can hear his smile from 600 miles away.\
  \ \u201CSome people are obsessed with money, it\u2019s bad for business. Don\u2019\
  t worry now, enjoy the desert, and when you come back you will stay with me, there\
  \ is an excellent cafe around the corner we can go to!\""
