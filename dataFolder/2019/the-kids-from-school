Text: "Narrow pockets roads, a bit of congestion, buildings toned in different shades\
  \ of blue, tiny doors and windows, what more could Jodhpur provide to satisfy weary\
  \ travel hungry architecture students from the South of India wandering out there\
  \ trying to figure out the place. Walking through the streets, that narrows down\
  \ after every turn, where even google maps finds it difficult to help, and with\
  \ the only navigation being the Mehrangarh Fort around which the whole city is built,\
  \ we walked deeper inside and eventually started getting lost, stuck in between\
  \ trying to find our way back and making new decisions comes a light in the dark,\
  \ three energetic looking kids in their wrinkled school uniforms, still in their\
  \ early innocent stage of life, comes up to us and asks, \"Are you guys lost?\"\
  \ to which we nodded in desperation and they decided to help us find our way out,\
  \ but instead we demanded them to help us explore the local areas, to which they\
  \ affirmed and took us around, ten to fifteen minutes and a few hundred steps later,\
  \ we are on top of this hill overlooking the panoramic view of the blue city. Calm,\
  \ quiet, peaceful and a chilled wind blowing on our face, what more could we ask\
  \ for, the views did not disappoint either. Overlooking the opposite hilltop was\
  \ the fort that we were navigating while getting lost.\nA few pictures and a half\
  \ an hour of random conversation with these kids, it was time for them to leave,\
  \ they were on their lunch break from school. We asked the kids to lead us towards\
  \ the fort which they did and parted our ways promising to meet at the same location\
  \ a few hours later. \nA long walk through the fort, and we are back at the hilltop,\
  \ where we find the kids all dressed up and ready to show us around, they took us\
  \ places that a tour guide would find difficult to show us or explain, they took\
  \ us around the local monuments, helped us taste the local delicacies, not to forget\
  \ cruising through the local markets, and helping us bargain whilst shopping.\n\
  The energy, enthusiasm and the trust these kids had for helping out people they\
  \ have never met in their life, whom they don't know, these are the real experiences\
  \ that helps change our outlook and perspective of how we should be molding our\
  \ characters.\nThe end to the amazing day was celebrated with sweets after which\
  \ they showed us our way out and we were headed towards the railway station, with\
  \ heavy hearts we departed not knowing if we could ever repay them for their kindness\
  \ and not knowing if we could ever meet again and even if we do, would they be the\
  \ same innocent kids we met and spent time with, the kind of feeling that you get\
  \ from such experiences that can ache our inner selves, that makes you sit down\
  \ and think, that is the travelling one should look forward to rather than going\
  \ around all the famous and publicly know places.\n\nGet out, get local, get lost,\
  \ the more you are lost, the more you find yourself."
