Text: "Five weeks up north offered a novel perspective on this vast country. Just\
  \ when you think you understand a place, that illusion (whether satisfactory or\
  \ not) is shattered and pieced back together to form a different mosaic. Enriching,\
  \ illuminating, affirming - all this \u2018goodness\u2019 started where everything\
  \ starts. At the beginning\u2026\n\nRoughly twelve hours after landing, arriving\
  \ at my lodgings with the area completely unknown and unseen and cloaked in night-time\
  \ blackness, I was already saying farewell to someone. And yet, an adventure of\
  \ its own had already unfolded before I even reached my destination. One that began\
  \ with a bit of hesitation. \n\nEverything was familiar, and yet not. Is that possible?\
  \ The heat, the dust hanging in the air, the smell of fuel and cooking food. After\
  \ enjoying a quiet, air-conditioned metro ride from the airport, the bus station\
  \ in the heart of New Delhi was a taste of the \u2018real thing\u2019. Backpack\
  \ strapped to me, handwritten notes pulled out, I walked around looking for the\
  \ local bus that would take me to Rishikesh.\nA few minutes later, cashew biscuits\
  \ and mango juice in hand (my Indian essentials),  I sat down in a front row seat\
  \ of a windowless bus, ready for the hours of slow travel ahead. The seat next to\
  \ me did not remain vacant for long. A young woman seized the opportunity of having\
  \ more legroom, and as the bus pushed its way through the crawling traffic, we struck\
  \ up a conversation. Fascinated to discover this was not my first time travelling\
  \ in her country, but first time going to her hometown, she delighted in creating\
  \ an appealing image of what to expect - something far removed from the dense pollution,\
  \ incessant hooting and multitudes of people so characteristic of an Indian city\
  \ that never sleeps.\n\nTypical of a journey like this, not only the passengers\
  \ but the driver too, needs a few moments of respite from the road and perilous\
  \ driving. Our bus pulled into the parking lot of a busy open-air restaurant, an\
  \ oasis of refreshment and activity in the middle of who knows where. Unable to\
  \ read the local language, I relied on my young bus companion to recommend something\
  \ from the menu. Much to my embarrassment, she insisted on paying and no amount\
  \ of gentle arguing was to sway her. \nThe heat cloyed to the skin, the flies landed\
  \ everywhere at every chance. The food could not be eaten fast enough and was left\
  \ to decorate the table. It was time to press on. The bus was back on the road with\
  \ much driving still ahead. We were to arrive long after dark, in a place completely\
  \ foreign to me.\n\nWe wound our way to the final stop at the Rishikesh bus station.\
  \  Though I was fatigued, I could not refuse the generous offer of a home cooked\
  \ meal. My friend thought it best to experience some authentic Indian hospitality\
  \ before we parted ways.\nArriving at her house, I found myself comfortably seated\
  \ on the floor with a spread of delicious local dishes to taste. Though I needed\
  \ a second stomach to continue eating, I could not miss the chance to enjoy this\
  \ home-cooking. A perfect introduction for the palate to what I would enjoy for\
  \ the next 5 weeks. As we ate, her younger siblings watched me from afar,  her parents\u2019\
  \ curiosity obvious. Despite being unable to speak a common language, the conversation\
  \ moved swiftly with questions, answers, translations and laughter. The fluorescent\
  \ light with colourful decorations and photos on the walls kept the darkness at\
  \ the door.  Midnight approached and though a bed to sleep in had been offered,\
  \ I knew I needed to arrive at the ashram in due time, as morning would start at\
  \ 5.30am.\n\nOutside it\u2019s brightly lit entranceway, long shadows of a hug were\
  \ cast. I felt such wonder at the strangers who adopted me for a couple of hours.\
  \ I saw this as a positive omen for the rest of my journey - a journey to be alone,\
  \ and yet contentedly never lonely."
