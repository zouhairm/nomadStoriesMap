Text: "Growing up in Mexico City I was used to the noise, the fast-paced life, the\
  \ sea of people who walk out their door in the morning. Sometimes it\u2019s hard\
  \ to find yourself in that sea of faces and stories. I often felt like a drop in\
  \ that ocean, indistinguishable and part of a strong tide that told me what to want,\
  \ what to wear, how to behave. At the same time I looked up to people who were making\
  \ change happen, who were finding their way in the world, and it made me feel so\
  \ lonely to be so far away from my own dreams, simply because I didn\u2019t know\
  \ them for sure anymore. It\u2019s like waking up one day and realizing you no longer\
  \ like ice cream, and maybe you haven\u2019t for a while.\nLife moves on even if\
  \ you don\u2019t. My fianc\xE9 got a big job opportunity which involved moving to\
  \ Panama, and since her vision of her professional future is way clearer than mine\
  \ I decided to support it. At least one of my dreams, which has always been living\
  \ abroad, will come true right now. So we get married in a rush, pack, and move.\
  \ We leave our loved ones behind hoping to become better people for them. \nArriving\
  \ in a new city is both exciting and scary. Even though I speak spanish there\u2019\
  s a language barrier created by the local culture, slang, and a different accent.\
  \ It\u2019s not actually hard, but exploring a new culture makes you feel like an\
  \ outsider, sometimes in good ways, sometimes in lonely ways. I fall in love with\
  \ the light, it changes so rapidly due to the weather it brings out interesting\
  \ contrasts I unsuccessfully try to capture with my camera. \nI visit the Panama\
  \ Canal locks, an authentic marvel in an astonishing landscape. It is truly a testimony\
  \ of the connected world we live in. Back when the U. S. still had the control of\
  \ the Canal, Clayton Fort was a military structure right across the street from\
  \ the locks designed to guard and defend them. Today it\u2019s a foundation which\
  \ fosters research and development, in which people live and work, with an incredible\
  \ sense of community enhanced by the arrangement of its buildings and big recreational\
  \ spaces. City of knowledge makes me feel at home because of its tranquil atmosphere,\
  \ the sound of nature, the smell of green, and the sound of families spending time\
  \ together.\nThen I meet someone who actually lives there, and we become friends\
  \ immediately. She\u2019s a foreigner too, she feels lonely after attending school\
  \ in London and not going back home to Italy but Panama, where her family moved\
  \ while she was studying. We connect on so many levels, whenever we meet it\u2019\
  s hard to stop talking. We realize we both expected to have life figured out after\
  \ graduation. Part of the problem is, our interests and passions seem so eclectic,\
  \ deep, and plentiful it\u2019s overwhelming. However, knowing we feel lost together\
  \ makes this new life a bit less scary. \nThen everything changes, her best friend\
  \ who is far away dies suddenly. We grow close during tearful calls. She finds shelter\
  \ under a tree where she sits all day, every day for weeks. When I visit her I share\
  \ my own painful memories and realize I\u2019m still not over them; we cry. We laugh\
  \ about stupid things and I give her a new journal because I know hers has run out\
  \ of paper below the tree. Whenever I think of our friendship I remember that urban\
  \ myth about how doppelgangers can\u2019t be in the same room for too long.\nAfter\
  \ weeks of grieving she decides to move away back to her hometown. I think life\
  \ is telling her to move on, to get some answers, to look for new dreams. Inspired\
  \ by her strength I decide to do the same, I dive into my new life and manage to\
  \ get an amazing job. And because the universe agrees with me this time, my new\
  \ job happens to be at City of Knowledge. Whenever I go by that tree I send her\
  \ a picture, just so we can tell how time goes by."
