Text: "I still remember the first trip to the beach that I took with my close friends.\
  \ Two years ago, my friends and I went to Seme Beach to rest and enjoy our vacation\
  \ together. We had been planning this trip for two weeks. During these two weeks\
  \ we made hotel reservations and bought food and beverages for the trip. Finally,\
  \ one Friday we left at 6 a.m. to Limbe (Seme) and arrived around 10 a.m.. As soon\
  \ as we arrived to the hotel, we started to drink at the bar in the swimming pool.\
  \ A few hours later we were drunk, so we decided to go to the beach. We played a\
  \ funny soccer game to down the level of alcohol in our blood. It was a funny experience\
  \ because nobody was able to kick the ball and almost everybody was sick. After\
  \ the game, we watched the sunset together, and we told stories about our lives\
  \ and shared our points of view about the future. Then we returned to the hotel,\
  \ and we ate some snacks. Moreover, we drink another beers and swam in the pool\
  \ until it got late. Around 12 p.m. we decided to play some games where the loser\
  \ had to take some shots. A lot of times, I was the loser and therefore I did not\
  \ remember what else happened during that crazy night. The next morning we took\
  \ a bicycle ride to some close beaches. I remember vividly the ride to Conyal Beach\
  \ since it was so pretty. For that reason, we decided to stayed there the rest of\
  \ the day and enjoy the breathtaking views of this paradise beach. After this exhausting\
  \ trip to Conyal Beach, we returned to our hotel. The next day, very early, we returned\
  \ to Buea. That was my first and unforgettable trip with my friends.\n         \
  \  All this took place in Cameroon (AFRICA), that's my home country and my nationality\
  \ but presently i'm in the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus .\nI grew up with an\
  \ adventurous spirit in me to an extend it led me in to having illusions and this\
  \ same spirit caused me to base my life wanting to watch a particular brand of film\
  \ (American War and Adventure films) getting me into knowing ancients histories\
  \ and origins. In every of my travel i always try to bring out some thing positive\
  \ out of it within the shortest period of my stay and try to right projects concerning\
  \ some and sale to interested people . I really wish this opportunity doesn't pass\
  \ me by so i can exploit iconic facts/points from Portugal that may help some people/or\
  \ the world tomorrow. I will be very honored if i'm being granted this hilarious\
  \ opportunity . Thanks"
