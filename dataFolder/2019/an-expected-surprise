Text: "Salento, Colombia.\n\nThe van shakes East through the Valle del Cocora, the\
  \ main artery in a system of valleys that unfolds like a rumpled bed sheet of green\
  \ billiard cloth, broken here and there by monstrous black rocks and that tartan\
  \ of Latin American hilltops, the dark green criss-crossing of coffee plantations.\
  \ We\u2019re bouncing towards Salento and it\u2019s just rained \u2014 the daily\
  \ hosedown. That smell permeates the van; it drips onto my shoulder. \n\tWhat is\
  \ this place? the question floats. I feel the precarious excitement that comes with\
  \ arriving somewhere unknown, propelled by hearsay recommendation.\n\tI\u2019ve\
  \ come to see the wax palms \u2014 the tallest in the world \u2014 extolled to me\
  \ by a duo in Mexico City who, when they told me, went quiet and leaned in. In truth,\
  \ it\u2019s that tone of reverence that forced my hand.\n\nI walk in from the North.\
  \ The town is an eight-minute-wide, gridded circle of one- and two-story buildings.\
  \ Nice, though I barely glance down to see it. All around, massive ridge-line mountains\
  \ grow and slash over each other distractingly, Western fronts glowing gold. I see\
  \ no palms, though I\u2019ve kept an eye for them.\n\tI splash through small puddles\
  \ on bricks to find a bed, pay for three nights and follow a girl down a hall. From\
  \ a back porch, in the first light of dusk, I see a building with people about.\
  \ All around them: mountain bikes. That gets me. \n\tWith a smile I walk into their\
  \ compound, point at the one of the downhill models, kicking proverbial tires. \n\
  \tWho\u2019s biking?\n\nMy question is answered the next morning by a jolting ride\
  \ out of town, over the R\xEDo Quindio and up into the mountains. Looking into the\
  \ fog, wondering when the palms will reveal themselves, I calm my nerves for the\
  \ downhill. The truck vibrates to 90\u2019s hip-hop and the ruts of the road. Our\
  \ guide is young and excited, he loves his job \u2014 he is Colombian Champion.\n\
  \tAn hour and a half later, we are stopped in a cloud, a swatch of green hill on\
  \ our left, dense fog on our right. Before us, the road descends into white. We\
  \ unload the bikes and we\u2019re on the road, struggling to keep up with the campe\xF3\
  n, who disappears around corners and hops bottomless holes in the edge of the road.\n\
  \tVibrations ring up from my palms, which itch and are going numb, into my shoulders.\
  \ The bike bucks \u2014 a stream runs down the road intermittently. The fog condenses\
  \ on my skin, cold rivulets running down my arms, my back.\n\tWe stop 20 minutes\
  \ in, still in the clouds, still cold. Where are the palms? I ask. How long until\
  \ we\u2019re out of the cloud? He shrugs and smiles. Maybe soon.\n\tWe get back\
  \ on the bikes and, just as I\u2019m thinking that the cold is unbearable, we break\
  \ through and around us \u2014 awe-striking \u2014 is a valley, green and dew-covered.\
  \ Everywhere, wax palms rise from the grass like Dr. Seuss\u2019s Truffala Trees,\
  \ their tops impossibly lush and heavy, tipping their slender stems to dangerous\
  \ angles.\n\tMy vision is drawn to them, these strange, skinny plants of some world\
  \ not bothered by Earthly restrictions of scale, and I struggle to keep my attention\
  \ on the ricocheting bike beneath me. The girl behind me can\u2019t, and falls in\
  \ an awful symphony of gravel and bike and person in spin cycle. She gets up, bleeding\
  \ from the elbow and hip, smiling. Couldn\u2019t keep my eyes on the road! she says.\
  \ It\u2019s too cool!\n\tOf course she\u2019s right. Of course she means the palms.\
  \ They are magnificent things, huge and glorious. They\u2019re too cool. Hidden\
  \ in the mountains, beneath a thick blanket of clouds; secret seeming.\n\tI step\
  \ off the bike and walk to the precipice of a long fall. I knew I would find them,\
  \ but not like this. Not covered in mud, frozen as I am, not on the back of a bike.\
  \ They\u2019re every bit as awesome as alluded to be. I feel special and insignificant\
  \ and fictional. This valley, these trees \u2014 it\u2019s unreal, surely. \n\t\
  It feels like they came to me differently, to surprise me even as I expected them."
