Text: "My first international infact family holiday to Melbourne, Australia at 38\
  \ years turned out to be an out of the world holiday of my Life Time.\n\nIt's Beautiful\
  \ to know a new place,  people,  culture,  connect with people,  locals, do those\
  \ little things that people love to do there & what we would Luv to do as well,\
  \ I travelled in local trains,  took local ferry to understand place better,  deeply,\
  \  meeting people who are ordinary and live next door, celebrating Diwali like never\
  \ before in Australia, Country drive side to Sydney was further beautiful and amazing.\
  \ People whom you meet understand small things about that place,  shopping,  food,\
  \ Etc etc adds it all.. \n\nI totally totally missed not traveling all my Life,\
  \  but who cares life begins when you know it what you would like and what you wish\
  \ to do.\n\nBetter late than sorry... Yes we will have heard that. But time to preach\
  \ as well so the short story & to share that travel knows no boundaries no destination\
  \ it just knows a Beautiful place to be in. \n\nI aspire to travel now, look forward\
  \ to forever now. \n\nLuv you Travelista!! \n\nPoo....."
