Text: "\u201CAll trains\u2014Cairo to Alexandria\u2014full today.\u201D\n\nI sigh,\
  \ exasperated. \u201COkay, thanks.\u201D\n\n\u201CAlexandria. Platform one.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CBut\u2014tickets?\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s okay! Go,\u201D and with that\
  \ he shoos us away.\n\nPerplexed, Naomi and I join the throng shoving, rather than\
  \ queueing, to the platform. We succumb to the horde, and the pressure pops us out\
  \ on the other side one by one, like paste squeezed through a tube. \n\nWe pass\
  \ dozens of beige-striped train cars and choose brown seats with matching curtains,\
  \ faded and stained, plush worn to bare thread. Soon, however, passengers assigned\
  \ to the seats arrive, so we move from seat to seat, playing musical train chairs\
  \ until finally, we are forced to stand. \n\u201CWe should get off,\u201D I say\
  \ to Naomi just as the train embarks. \n\nA uniformed man approaches us\u2014we\u2019\
  re trapped. \u201CTazkara?\u201D\u2014ticket? \n\n\u201CMafeesh\u201D\u2014without\u2014\
  I respond, worried.\n\n\u201CMafeesh mushkellah\u201D\u2014no problem. \n\n\u201C\
  Fayn?\u201D \u2013Where? I question, when he hands back our change and \u201Ctickets\u201D\
  \ (pieces of paper he\u2019s written on). He leads us to a crawl space between compartments.\
  \ \n\nStill unassured, Naomi and I huddle in the corner until he returns with two\
  \ additional passengers and plastic stools for all of us. \n\nFrom the window of\
  \ the narrow compartment door, we see that Cairo never really ends. Humanity merely\
  \ thins, constellating into clusters of buildings adorned with satellite dishes,\
  \ interrupted by fields of crops. Bony cows are led by coarse rope hackamores along\
  \ dirt roads lining the trash-piled banks of the Nile. Little boys walk among sheep,\
  \ their fathers shepherding both from the backs of donkeys. \n\nA fellow, seatless\
  \ passenger lights a cigarette. \u201CSigara henna? Kwayis?\u201D\u2014Cigarette\
  \ here? Okay?\u2014Naomi asks.\n \n\u201CSure,\u201D he replies in English, cigarette\
  \ gripped in his teeth as he tucks the lighter back into his pocket. \n\n\u201C\
  But there\u2019s a \u2018No Smoking\u2019 sign.\u201D \n\n\u201CYeah, and someone\
  \ wrote: \u2018we sell cigarettes here\u2019 on it,\u201D he points to graffiti\
  \ on the sign. \u201CWe all smoke; this is Egypt!\u201D\n\nI had expected to get\
  \ in trouble for hopping on the full train, unticketed. Instead, we were smoking\
  \ from seats with a view.\n\nCivilization thickens again as we near Alexandria.\
  \ Our fellow smokers open the compartment door to kick the butts onto the tracks\
  \ as the train chugs sluggishly by crates of tomatoes, hanging cow carcasses, sheep\
  \ grazing on old lettuce heaped at the center of a street, and people streaming\
  \ through, around, and sometimes over, the interminable pandemonium.\n\nWe stack\
  \ and stow our stools as the train screeches into the station. \n\nKids wave at\
  \ us and holler \u201CWelcome to Egypt!\u201D the English words everyone seems to\
  \ know. Motorcycles attached to carts rumble over the tram rails, shouting their\
  \ services through megaphones.\n\nThere are palm trees in this quarter, their ancient\
  \ roots disrupting sidewalks. They grow up against the European-looking buildings\
  \ with cracking paint, sections of brick and cement entirely exposed and sometimes\
  \ crumbling away. Laundry floats on lines above us, and cats curl into shop corners,\
  \ under carts, and on blue and green-shuttered window ledges. \n\n\u201CI think\
  \ the only thing Egypt needs to become really popular is a powerwash and fresh paint,\u201D\
  \ Naomi jokes. \n\nIt\u2019s a Friday before prayer, and the streets start quiet\
  \ and sunny, but as the day wears on, rain, sunlit and warm, comes with the traffic.\
  \ Naomi and I duck into the nearest ahwa\u2014the quintessential Egyptian gathering\
  \ place. Once-vibrant cloths, now faded by dust and sun and time, cover tables set\
  \ with black tea and mint, Turkish coffee, and shisha (hookah). Hot coals are rushed\
  \ around to feed the pipes of muttering men playing dominoes on wooden boards. The\
  \ coffee is good, but \u201Cmafeesh sukr\u201D\u2014without sugar\u2014really just\
  \ means \u201Cless sugar\u201D. \n\n\u201CShams? Bukra?\u201D\u2014Sunlight? Tomorrow?\u2014\
  Naomi asks a man next to us. \n\n\u201CMomkin aiwa, insha\u2019Allah\u201D\u2014\
  Maybe yes, God willing.\n\nWe sit for a while, and I see residents intentionally\
  \ drop scraps for a dog taking refuge with her pups in a trash-filled dirt pit.\
  \ \nIn Egypt, you can hop on the packed train, you just might have to sit on a plastic\
  \ stool between compartments.\n\nHere, there\u2019s no singular way to do anything\
  \ that\u2019s possible, and there\u2019s at least one way to do any impossible thing.\
  \ In Egypt, there\u2019s always sun tomorrow, insha\u2019Allah."
