Text: "I can feel the sticky air in the van thicken as soon as the driver cuts the\
  \ air conditioning to have more power for the hill ahead of us. The humidity instantly\
  \ causes my skin to gleam with tacky sweat. My eyes stay closed for the majority\
  \ of the drive from the Indigenous Peoples Lodge to Ou Rona village, half because\
  \ it\u2019s seven o\u2019clock in the morning and half because the dirt kicked up\
  \ by the wheels blows straight into my face from the open window in front of me.\
  \ It\u2019s the end of the rainy season in Cambodia, late November, and I am trying\
  \ to remember what autumn in Maryland feels like. Through my headphones I play songs\
  \ that remind me of the dance parties I have with my mother when we cook family\
  \ dinners together.\n\nThanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays, second only\
  \ to Halloween because October 31st doubles as my birthday. I\u2019d spent the previous\
  \ two months sweeping through Cambodia and Vietnam, shoving the thought of missing\
  \ my favorite food-day with my parents and four sisters to the back corners of my\
  \ mind. But today is Thanksgiving and I am not in Maryland; instead, I am in Mondulkiri\
  \ Province in Cambodia collecting traditional stories from indigenous Bunong villages.\
  \ \n\nPulling my ponytail through the loop in my hat, I jump out of the van to convene\
  \ with my translator -- an older Bunong man who I\u2019d been introduced to only\
  \ days ago, but who can translate the Bunong language to English brilliantly. A\
  \ fellow researcher points us toward the house which she visited earlier this week\
  \ where the children raved about their mother\u2019s stories (I make note of how\
  \ kind it was for her to think to set up an interview for me). \u201CJust around\
  \ the bend in the road and on the right. You\u2019ll see lots of chickens and children.\u201D\
  \n\n A woman carrying a child on her hip stands in front of a stilted wooden house,\
  \ with several chickens pecking about around her feet leading us to believe we had\
  \ found our storyteller. She excitedly waves us down the walkway to the shade underneath\
  \ her home. Another younger woman, who seems just a few years older than my own\
  \ twenty, swings in a hammock with a sleeping baby. I can\u2019t help but laugh\
  \ watching two toddlers -- a boy without a shirt and a girl without pants -- clumsily\
  \ chase each other around hammocks and house stilts. A man offers me a chair. I\
  \ thank him in Khmer, forgetting briefly that there is another language at play\
  \ here; he smiles and nods anyway, laying back in a hammock adjacent to me. \n\n\
  Before I could muster an introduction, the woman motions to the platform beside\
  \ me. I turn to see a plate mounded with vibrant orange papaya. She\u2019d been\
  \ expecting company. She smiles and urges us to help ourselves, so when my translator\
  \ takes a slice I follow suit. I hate papaya but I love warm welcomes. While we\
  \ snack she corrals the toddlers into another hammock and they giggle when I hand\
  \ them both some fruit as well. I hear the woman let out a pleased sigh before she\
  \ takes her own slice, gets comfortable next to me, and begins to tell a folktale\
  \ about a deer. \n\nIt takes a moment for me to remember that the family in front\
  \ of me doesn't know the significance of this day for me. They don\u2019t know that\
  \ at nine o\u2019clock in the morning on Thanksgiving day I am usually drinking\
  \ coffee and chatting around the kitchen island in my childhood home with three\
  \ younger siblings, one older, and two parents. But today is Thanksgiving and I\
  \ am not in Maryland; instead I am listening to stories over breakfast with a Bunong\
  \ family in Cambodia, and I am equally as grateful."
