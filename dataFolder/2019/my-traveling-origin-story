Text: "Until about a year ago, I really didn\u2019t get traveling.  It was always\
  \ one of those things that I thought was for \u201Cother people.\u201D\n\nIn short,\
  \ they were everyone but me, or so social media made it seem.\n\nBefore I pulled\
  \ the classic desperation move of becoming a dog dad, I figured I might as well\
  \ take advantage of an incredible perk my company had\u200A\u2014\u200Aa two-week\
  \ exchange program for employees to work out of an international office.\n\nI chose\
  \ London, followed by two weeks of backpacking that would take me and Seth, a friend\
  \ from home, through Western Europe. Then I'd spend four days traveling solo through\
  \ the Greek Islands.\n\nBy the time I landed in Santorini, I was absolutely exhausted\
  \ and incapable of wiping the scowl off my face.\n\nThere was a group of people\
  \ chatting nearby at the hostel I was staying at who I assumed knew each other.\n\
  \nI chose to sit across the room by some outlet so that I could \u201Ccharge my\
  \ phone\u201D when in reality I felt too awkward and vulnerable to go engage in\
  \ their conversation without my social crutch, Seth, with me.\n\nAfter eavesdropping,\
  \ I realized they did not, in fact, know one another. Actually, they had just met\
  \ that day. I was also starting to feel self-conscious of the fact that I was being\
  \ almost intentionally anti-social. I had to do something.\n\nI waited for a pause\
  \ in the conversation, picked the most approachable-looking person, and asked her\
  \ for the wifi password, despite already being connected. Within a minute of small\
  \ talk, she invited me over to join their powwow where we traded names, hometowns,\
  \ and travel plans.\n\nThey were planning on heading to one of Santorini\u2019s\
  \ many beaches in the next 20 minutes for some gyros and cliff jumping and told\
  \ me to join them. \n\nI recognized that this was a big moment for me.\n\nI could\
  \ stay here and nap once my room was ready, or I could go with these friendly strangers\
  \ and experience what it\u2019s like to go off-itinerary and just let things happen\u200A\
  \u2014\u200Athe stuff that you hear travel is all about.\n\nI did not take the nap.\n\
  \n\nAfter an afternoon of deliciously cheap gyros stuffed with tzatziki and french\
  \ fries, cliff jumping, and beer towers, I felt like I had known these people for\
  \ months.\n\nIt was my first time realizing that magical stuff happens while you\
  \ travel if you stop trying to control everything and start being open to what comes.\n\
  \nFor the next two days we were inseparable until we started to go our separate\
  \ ways. I continued on to the neighboring island of Ios, a little worried that I\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be able to replicate that magic.\n\nTo my surprise, I instantly\
  \ bonded with a new group of travelers. It was during a particularly sweaty dance\
  \ session at a silent disco where I had an out of body experience.  \n\nI realized\
  \ that I was with a bunch of strangers that I had known for one day, dancing like\
  \ an idiot without a care in the world\u2014something my typically reserved nature\
  \ does not do.\n\nQuestions were racing through my mind as I took in the scene.\n\
  \nWhat is happening?\n\nHow do I meet people so quickly and reach this level of\
  \ comfort so fast?\n\nHow has it taken me 26 years to experience this?\n\nI left\
  \ Europe energized and motivated to start planning my next trip.\n\nNot long after\
  \ I returned, some impressive targeted Facebook advertising introduced me to a company\
  \ called Remote Year, which helped you travel abroad for 12 months with a community\
  \ of other people while keeping your job. \n\nIf anything was meant for those \u201C\
  other people,\u201D it was this.\n\n...right?\n\nThat was when this crazy, semi-terrifying\
  \ realization dawned on me\u2026I could actually do it.\n\nThen a second, even more\
  \ terrifying realization dawned on me\u2026I really wanted to do it!\n\nNow all\
  \ I had to do was get back that deposit I put down for the puppy because nothing\
  \ seemed crazier to me at that point than getting a dog.\n\nNot even selling all\
  \ of my things to travel the world for an entire year with a bunch of strangers."
