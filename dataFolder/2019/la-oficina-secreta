Text: "I don\u2019t remember the name of the park, but to my amigos cubanos, it was\
  \ La Oficina Secreta, or The Floridita, so called because it sits on the doorstep\
  \ of the famous bar of the same name that Ernest Hemingway used to frequent. On\
  \ my first day alone in Havana, when everyone had gone home and I was left behind\
  \ to binge on salsa classes until the end of the month, I went to sit in the park\
  \ to take a break from the gritty streets of the old town of Cuba\u2019s capital\
  \ city. As I sat down, I saw a guy turn back to look at me. I didn\u2019t pay further\
  \ attention to him until he and his friend moved, and repositioned themselves so\
  \ that they sat just across from me.\_\n\n\u201CAre you Mexican?\u201D they asked\
  \ me in Spanish.\_\n\nI didn\u2019t feel like entertaining them, so I told them\
  \ that I don\u2019t speak Spanish. \_\n\n\u201CWe don\u2019t believe you,\u201D\
  \ they said, again in Spanish.\_\n\n\u201CThen don\u2019t,\u201D I said, making\
  \ the mistake of answering them in their language. Now they knew that I could both\
  \ speak and understand Spanish.\_\n\n\u201CYou are Mexican,\u201D they insisted.\_\
  \n\n\u201CI\u2019m from South Africa.\u201D\_\n\n\u201CSudafrica? No es possible\
  \ \u2014 tu es blanca, y entiendes espa\xF1ol. Tu es Mexicana!\u201D\n\n\u201CThere\
  \ are white people in South Africa too.\u201D\n\n\u201CMentirosa!\u201D\_\n\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m not lying. I\u2019m not Mexican.\u201D\_\n\n\u201CMentirosa!\u201D\n\n\
  With that, I got my driver\u2019s license from my wallet to prove that I was indeed\
  \ from South Africa. They edged closer to me so that they could take a look, and\
  \ the proof of my identity fortunately silenced their questions on my origins. I\
  \ explained that, though a minority, there are white people in South Africa, that\
  \ I was born and raised there, and that my family is Greek, which is probably why\
  \ I\_look Latina to them. They launched into a volley of questions about how long\
  \ I was in Havana for, what I thought of the place, did I like dancing, and most\
  \ importantly, had I been to the terrace of the Hotel Inglaterra to salsa.\_\n\n\
  At this point, another of their friends showed up. I learned that his name was Allain,\
  \ and that the other two were Marco, and Guillermo. What fascinated me about this\
  \ trio from the beginning, was their preoccupation with, and equal disinterest in,\
  \ the different colors of their skins. They were the best of friends, of that I\
  \ was sure, but they mentioned their different skin tones at every opportunity.\
  \ Allain, with his sun-kissed white skin, was the blancito, while Marco, whose skin\
  \ was a light brown, was the jabaon, a word, they explained to me meant that he\
  \ was mixed race. The negrito, Guillermo, was the darkest of the three. They were\
  \ amusing, these three boys, and I immediately took to the easy way in which they\
  \ interacted with one another. Laughing and playfully teasing each other, they passed\
  \ around cigarettes, and all took sips from the same small carton of ron.\_\n\n\
  I learned that they were all from Guantanamo, and had come to Havana because wages\
  \ were higher. Now, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what each of them does for a living,\
  \ because my Spanish isn\u2019t actually good enough to be mistaken for a Mexican,\
  \ but this is the gist of it: Allain works in a mercado, Marco works in an Italian\
  \ restaurant (and loves to throw around his handful of Italian words to prove it),\
  \ and Guillermo either makes, or sells, jewelry. Being from outside of Havana made\
  \ them all campos, I was told, and so they looked out for one another in the big\
  \ city. The park that we were in was their office, where they would meet after work\
  \ and hang out, drinking ron, smoking cheap cigarettes, and talking nonsense. Sometimes,\
  \ one of them (usually Marco) might be distracted by his pursuits of finding a foreign\
  \ chica with money, but the ritual of meeting in the office each day was almost\
  \ always observed. And so this is how it came to be that, for the duration of my\
  \ stay in Havana, I was welcomed to these meetings in the office with open arms\
  \ -- open arms, and a small carton of ron."
