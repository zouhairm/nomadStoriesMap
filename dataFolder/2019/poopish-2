Text: "\u201CI\u2019m poopish,\u201D I whispered to Priya. \u201CThat\u2019s not even\
  \ a word,\u201D she said. \u201CIt\u2019s five in the morning. Do you have to do\
  \ this right now?\u201D I asked her. We walked out to the fields, wrapped in shawls,\
  \ shining our torches on the mossy, uneven path. We went straight to the spot that\
  \ Asha Didi had taken us to the previous morning. \u201CI\u2019m going there. You\
  \ stay here,\u201D I told her. Priya didn\u2019t look confident about waiting alone\
  \ in the dark but she nodded. I found a fairly clear spot and squatted. The grass\
  \ tickled my butt. I was nervous. There could be snakes. Bees might sting. Someone\
  \ could be watching. I kept shining the torch around to make sure no snakes were\
  \ sneaking up on me. I waited. My brain told me to poop but my body was as firmly\
  \ corked as a wine bottle. I walked back. \u201CDone?\u201D Priya asked. I shook\
  \ my head. \u201CYou\u2019ll have to some time, you know,\u201D she said.\n\nAsha\
  \ Didi was making us breakfast. A pot of chai was already brewing on a mud-stove.\
  \ She swung a fan made out of coir to get rid of the smoke that the stove was spewing.\
  \ Plates heaped with Poha were set before us. I pushed in a couple of mouthfuls.\
  \ \u201CYou don\u2019t like Poha?\u201D Asha Didi asked me. \u201CYou want me to\
  \ make you something else?\u201D \u201CNo no, this is really good,\u201D I said.\
  \ \u201CBut you\u2019re not having any!\u201D \u201CMy stomach isn\u2019t okay,\u201D\
  \ I told her. \u201CMaybe the chai will help,\u201D she said. \u201CI\u2019ve added\
  \ ginger to it. That\u2019s how you city people like it, don\u2019t you?\u201D Asha\
  \ Didi pulled Priya aside as we were going back to our room. \u201CDoes she not\
  \ like the food?\u201D she asked her. \u201CYou cook wonderfully,\u201D Priya assured\
  \ her. \u201CIt\u2019s just that she hasn\u2019t been to the loo since we got here.\u201D\
  \ Asha Didi was astonished. \u201CBut why not! Everyone here uses the fields.\u201D\
  \ \u201CShe\u2019s used to a toilet. But don\u2019t worry, it\u2019ll happen,\u201D\
  \ Priya said.\n\nPriya and I had ditched our usual Goa beaches-bikinis-beer holiday\
  \ route. A friend from Chattisgarh suggested we go to Andhala. Andhala was as different\
  \ from Mumbai as different could be. Mud houses lined the little village and square\
  \ courtyards lay in the middle of the houses. Farms stretched endlessly and phones\
  \ caught network only halfway up the hill. The farms didn\u2019t yield much though\
  \ and women from a local self-help group took in guests in the winters so that their\
  \ households could survive the summers. In our eagerness to live in a village, I\
  \ had forgotten that many Indian village homes don\u2019t have toilets. \n\nI lay\
  \ on a wooden charpoy in the courtyard that afternoon, reading a book when Asha\
  \ Didi\u2019s daughter called out to me from behind the house. \u201CCome here,\
  \ look what we made,\u201D she yelled. Asha Didi had put up four bamboos and wrapped\
  \ old sarees around it. \u201CThis is your toilet,\u201D she told me, beaming at\
  \ her creation. That evening, I shone the torch and walked to my makeshift loo.\
  \ Asha Didi, bless her, had even dug a little pit in there. I squatted over the\
  \ pit and prayed. A dog\u2019s shadow went in circles around the makeshift loo.\
  \ It sniffed at all corners before peeing against one of them. The loo was clearly\
  \ working for someone, if not for me. \n\nI woke up about half past five the next\
  \ morning. My slippers were nowhere to be found. I walked barefoot to our spot,\
  \ the cool grass beneath my feet. I squatted there and waited. The dog, no longer\
  \ a shadow, hung around, giving me company. The sun was beginning to rise, still\
  \ a faint blur across the farm. I switched off the torch. The birds were chirping.\
  \ The grass tickled my butt. I liked the tiled bathroom back home, but this was\
  \ good too. This place was beginning to grow on me. Asha Didi was up when I got\
  \ back. \u201CDid you do it?\u201D she asked me. I nodded, grinned. \u201CExcellent!\u201D\
  \ she said. \u201CSit here, I\u2019ll make you some chai.\u201D"
