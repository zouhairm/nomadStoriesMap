Text: "\u201CI had never thought about it before\u201D- you told me. We were standing\
  \ on the 7th platform at the train station Hauptbahnhof in Linz ready for our first\
  \ trip together, trip to Paris. I was from Russia and he-from United States, two\
  \ countries which still couldn't find a way to figure out their relationship, and\
  \ we were two people who kind of did it. We met one month ago but it felt like entire\
  \ life had already passed by. Trains in Austria were always late , despite the fact\
  \ that Austrians were so proud of their punctuality, which as we felt had  never\
  \ excited. \nHe slept at the airport on the floor, like typical American without\
  \ thinking about being judged and concerning only about comfort . I was sitting\
  \ near by in a fur coat with make up on looking like I was not traveling, looking\
  \ like I was going out on a date, typical Russian woman with a book in my hands.\n\
  Everybody told me that Paris was the city of love. My American said Paris was the\
  \ most romanticized city in US culture and that he had always imagined his honeymoon\
  \ there. He was 22. I was 21 and I had been to that city of true love before. It\
  \ smelled like croissants to me and only musicians on the streets made it special.\
  \ We met some of them there. At the end of our first day after visiting catacombs\
  \ of Paris, there I was joking that He would berry me with my phone to fulfill the\
  \ collection of dead people in that place ,we went on Montmartre-my huge love in\
  \ the city of love. I knew that usually some really great musicians and singers\
  \ performed near the Sacre Coeur , so I dragged him to see it. I was wrong about\
  \ the amount of musicians, but I was right about great performances. It felt so\
  \ right to get cuddled by him on the stairs of Sacre Coeur and to listen to old\
  \ American songs by a guy with acoustic guitar and with French accent.\nIt was so\
  \ funny that even in Paris where people were fighting so hard for their language\
  \ we still said to everyone  German \u201CDanke\u201D instead of \u201CMerci\u201D\
  . Literally everywhere even when we were buying tickets to Eiffel Tower while the\
  \ great Parisian marketing directors were buying us. I used to watch a lot of Disney\
  \ movies in my childhood and I felt like princess, maybe that's why I thought he\
  \ would say three words on the top of the most romantic place in the world . But\
  \ He didn't. I But I knew He was in love, but not a romantic man.\nYou know , there\
  \ are some moments in life when you feel  like it is a movie scene,When two heroes\
  \ are cooking together without explaining who should do that and who should do this\
  \ , when you are dancing together while waiting Italian pasta to get ready in France.\
  \ We had that moment in our small Parisian Airbnb.\nLast day in the morning we went\
  \ to the restaurant on Champs-Elysees to inhale the smell of Paris and croissants\
  \ the last time that trip.We were holding hands and somebody near us were speaking\
  \ Russian and smiling at us. It turned out that it was Ukrainian man , who had been\
  \ living in Paris for a long time. He spoke Russian with me so My American couldn't\
  \ understand.The man asked if I liked Paris and if it was my first time there. I\
  \ said I'd been there before .The man said that i would come there many times in\
  \ my live and maybe even I would marry  the boy who I was with.I laughed and answered\
  \ that it was great that my American didn't understood Russian language.In fact\
  \ My American was leaving the next day back to US.\nMaybe we'll meet one day on\
  \ this earth again. But I am sure that I will come back to Paris ."
