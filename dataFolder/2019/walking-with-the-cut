Text: "Lunchtime comes, Winslet has fallen over, cut her arm. At first I suspect she\u2019\
  s crying from some small scratch. I see Gillian, she was a Nurse in Ghana before\
  \ this, she' shaking. She\u2019s not sure what to do, then I see the wound. It\u2019\
  s horrible, yellow fat spills behind lacerated child muscle. Kate is convulsing\
  \ and there is lots of blood. I take off my shirt and tie it around the bloody forearm,\
  \ it\u2019s loose so I start again. With a good clove hitch around I pick her up\
  \ and we start the walk through Kibera slum to the doctors some 25 minutes away.\
  \ Everyone is looking at us, my bare chest dashed with my students blood, the community\
  \ symbolically nods at the sight. Kate gets very heavy after a while, it\u2019s\
  \ painful but when I look at her little face I forget my sufferings. We skirt down\
  \ alleyways, over open sewage lines, people are defecating in the street adjacent\
  \ the doctors. I stumble inside and let Gillian do the talking. The doctors remove\
  \ the bandage she had put on and more blood pours from Kate. The doctors start to\
  \ prepare her for stitches, iodine and local anesthetic are administered in quiet\
  \ procession. Then her face is contorting, she bites her lip and tightens every\
  \ muscle to the limit. They are sewing her arm back together as I held her head\
  \ and mutter useless English phrases. It goes like this for an hour or so and blood\
  \ keeps coming. Finally, they purse the 8th stitch together and clasp her arm shut\
  \ with some proper bandages. She's shaken but we muster her and walk her back. At\
  \ some point in all this I felt so queezy and disgusted I almost vomited. I took\
  \ a second to think about Kate\u2019s pain and I alighted to aid her in some way\
  \ which washed my ailments away. We went back to school and Kate took her seat among\
  \ the rest of the class, the little girl is stoic, surrounded by the rest of the\
  \ children, she stares forward at me and the blackboard and her life moves forward,\
  \ but for a small moment, I thought I'd lost her."
