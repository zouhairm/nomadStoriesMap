Text: "I was starting to get used to the scenery in Manah. A small town in East Oman\
  \ surrounded by sand, only the mountains broke the steady desert horizon. I had\
  \ asked the college\u2019s bus driver to drop me off at the local mosque where I\
  \ would meet my new contact. My Arabic had gotten better within the few weeks I\
  \ had been here, but I still felt a little awkward using it outside of the classroom.\n\
  \nA courtyard with stone benches, trees, and a water fountain surrounded the cream\
  \ coloured mosque. We didn\u2019t have courtyards in the mosques in Australia. The\
  \ mosques often had to maximise the space given to them and they were not able to\
  \ indulge in features like these. Standing at the front was my new friend, Tariq,\
  \ I had met him only a week ago. He was from Egypt and was teaching Islamic studies\
  \ at a local school here. Our college class took a field trip to this particular\
  \ school to see Arabic education in action. I was lucky enough to sit in Tariq\u2019\
  s class and watch him pour his joy and energy out into the teaching materials. \n\
  \nAfter the class, I went up to him and thanked him for allowing us to sit in his\
  \ class while he taught the local Omani children. He was happy to show off his skills\
  \ and the local education system. I had gotten used to the style of hospitality\
  \ here, so when he invited me to his place for dinner I thought maybe it was simply\
  \ a hollow offer. For some reason, however, on that day I took a step out of my\
  \ comfort zone. I said yes, gave him my number and we organised a time when I would\
  \ be able to pass the main town again.\n\nAs we walked back to his place he told\
  \ me that every second Wednesday a bunch of his friends, all from Egypt, met up\
  \ for dinner. This would be a great experience to meet people and practice my Arabic.\
  \ His small apartment sat above a restaurant in the middle of town. We walked past\
  \ a few families on the way to his room; they all seemed to also be foreign workers.\
  \ \n\nThere was something else that broke the endless desert horizon here in Manah\
  \ as well as in other parts of Oman. It was the large properties that were being\
  \ built by Omani nationals. I thought this was how most people in this spacious\
  \ part of the country lived. As Tariq brought me through his humble kitchen and\
  \ into the small living room, where we were going to eat I realised that wasn\u2019\
  t the case.\n\nOne by one, his Egyptian friends arrived and we sat on the floor\
  \ cramming ourselves in his small tv room. The dishes came into the room almost\
  \ as frequently as the guests. After the first few I started to forget names and\
  \ origins, in total I think nearly 15 people came that night. They were all foreign\
  \ workers and were all working in teaching. Despite our communication difficulties,\
  \ they were eager to know about what living in Australia was like. I too was so\
  \ interested in their life stories, why had they left their home countries and who\
  \ had the left behind. I imagined his friends lived in similar conditions, but in\
  \ the presence of good food and countrymen, I could not read any signs of discomfort.\n\
  \n\LLong before the end of the night, I had exhausted most of the conversation topics\
  \ I could handle in Arabic. Tariq and his guests still tried their very best to\
  \ make me feel at home, constantly refilling my plate and sometimes asking the same\
  \ questions over and over again simply to keep up conversation. I had no idea how\
  \ I was getting home but one of Tariq\u2019s friends, who by now I had no idea what\
  \ his name was, offered to give me a lift home. In the car I thought about it, there\
  \ was probably some rule about going to men\u2019s houses for dinner by yourself\
  \ when you had just met them, in a foreign country but I\u2019m really glad I trusted\
  \ my instinct and in Tariq."
