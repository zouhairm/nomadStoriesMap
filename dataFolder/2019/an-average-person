Text: "I am Zara Ahmad. An Ordinary person just like billions of other people alive\
  \ on the face of earth about whom nobody talks about. \n\nWhy i am saying this is\
  \ vecause whereever i travelled nobody,literally nobody focused or admired the normal\
  \ people. They always glorify people who achieve something, who are more privileged.\
  \ What about billion of other people who also struggle the same way but cant make\
  \ their way through people or are not highlighted.\n\nThat got me thinking that\
  \ some are fortunate enough to be born with high levels of intelligence, or with\
  \ a high degree of attractiveness or in an influential wealthy families giving them\
  \ a prominence in the world. Some strive their way through it. Then there is a very\
  \ common breed of people, people who covers almost 70% of the worlds population,\
  \ the breed of least talked about people AN AVERAGE PERSON. \nIn a perfectly designed\
  \ world each indvidual is looking for the best. In the search of the most ideal\
  \ and the ultimate, the MEDIOCRE are always forsaken. \n\nEvery single day we scroll\
  \ down over our social media. All we see is the perfectly designed lives of people,\
  \ making many being usatified with their own. Being in a constant battle to cope\
  \ up with the ideals of the world. In the struggle to achieve the best we have lost\
  \ the beauty of simple things that matter.\nBeauty isnt in perfectly shaped brows\
  \ and fuller lips and winged eyeliner. Beauty is in the imperfections, beauty is\
  \ in beig YOU rather than being a pile of sephora goods.\nTravelling isnt about\
  \ going abroad and posing infront of perfectly architetured place, Travelling is\
  \ in exploring even that be your backyard or a colony park.\nFun isnt about clubs,\
  \ discos and bars. Fun is in what makes you happy.\nSuccess isnt about earning big\
  \ bucks, Success is what makes you satisfied.\nFitness isnt in starving yourself\
  \ to zero size. Fitness is in being healthy so if your chubby with a good health\
  \ you are perfect.\nLove isnt in fancy dine outs and diamond rings. Love is about\
  \ understanding and it doesnt cost a thing.\n\nSo stop weighing up your life with\
  \ the perfect standards of the world. Be the best version of yourself. Be content\
  \ with what has been betowed to you it may not be according to the model of perfection\
  \ of this world but its just the right amount according to your Creator. The only\
  \ comparison is the person you were yesterday. Endeavour to be a better human being\
  \ rather being a dummy of brands and accesories.\nLife is in simple things so let\
  \ it be."
