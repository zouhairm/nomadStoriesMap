Text: "\u201CLook up,\u201D his voice ringing through the clear night, \u201Cshe is\
  \ right above our heads, she is dancing!\u201D\n\nWe are perched on the rocks between\
  \ the powder white snow and the freezing water of a northern fjord a few hours drive\
  \ from Troms\xF8, Norway.\n\nWe crane our necks to stare in awe at the sky, as the\
  \ green glow stretches from the frozen mountain peaks shining ghostly white under\
  \ the full moon, and drifts, shivering across the sky. Constantly shifting, she\
  \ ebbs and flows like quicksand between the constellations, disappearing only to\
  \ reappear in a new direction, painting the sky in a fleeting incandescent  ink.\n\
  \nWe had left the city of Troms\xF8 a few hours earlier that night, with hopes of\
  \ seeing the lights kept low, on a tight leash. It\u2019s joked that Aurora is like\
  \ any woman, driven by whim and prone to fickle changes in behaviour. She\u2019\
  s difficult to predict, and you need to get lucky.\n\nThe lights are the result\
  \ of a specific cocktail of environmental and meteorological conditions, that when\
  \ mixed just right- will result in the phenomenon. There are many tales of people\
  \ setting out to chase the lights, night after night, and not a flicker. In short,\
  \ the sight is creates as particles are hurled from the sun\u2019s solar storms\
  \ and caught in the Earth\u2019s electromagnetic fields. The particles are drawn\
  \ down to the poles, and here they collide with atoms in our atmosphere- creating\
  \ energy that is emitted as light. Green for oxygen, red for nitrogen.\n\nFrom below,\
  \ when conditions are right, we can see a breathtaking aurora. The dancing lights.\n\
  \nAnd we got lucky. We had a clear night, below freezing temperatures and a sun\
  \ storm a few days prior.\n\nFrom the insulation of our snow suits (and about ten\
  \ other layers under that), we watched as the skies came alive. The lights started\
  \ softly, a haze similar to a strand of light cloud cover against the starry sky.\
  \ Even at this tiny flicker, we stood watching with jaws dropped, small puffs of\
  \ steam obscuring the view with each breath.\n\nFor so many of us, this sight has\
  \ been a far off wonder that we thought we might never see. Yet there, hovering\
  \ above the mountain fjords of Norway, a green glow \u2013 that could be nothing\
  \ but the collisions of solar wind particles against our planet\u2019s atmosphere-\
  \ was growing brighter.\n\nAnd she grew stronger, leaping across the sky, creating\
  \ a river of twisting green light above our heads.\n\nThe best way to see the full\
  \ spectacle is to lie on the ground, face to face with the heavens. It was somewhere\
  \ around -20 degrees Celsius by this point and the beach we were on smelled faintly\
  \ of rotting fish and livestock manure (I like to think this might be from moose\
  \ or reindeer nearby). Embraced in nature, we lit a small camp fire on the rocks\
  \ to thaw our fingers and faces and once again turned our attention to the skies.\n\
  \nIn the sub-freezing cold, the lights danced from one side of the sky to the other,\
  \ and for around 3 hours, we were mesmerised.\n\nWe were lucky. We were lucky to\
  \ have the conditions just right to see the Aurora. But even without that, the experience\
  \ of lying on the beach, ice glistening from the seaweed washed ashore, the campfire\
  \ crackling and throwing shadows against the snow, the mountains glowing under the\
  \ full moon- it was incredible. To be surrounded by nature- the stars, the mountains,\
  \ the fish head and the moose of my imagination, that would have been enough. To\
  \ see the lights was the magic on top of an incredible night in the Norwegian natural\
  \ landscape."
