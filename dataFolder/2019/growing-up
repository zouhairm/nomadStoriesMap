Text: "It was the first time i was travelling completely on my own. Well, not at all.\
  \ It was just me and my friend, but we were both only 16 years old, we were just\
  \ kids. We were about to live the best experience of our lives, we had planned this\
  \ trip for months. We really wanted to improved our english in America, so we went\
  \ for it, but it was not that easy.\nThe day arrived, our parents took us to the\
  \ airport, we said goodbye and then the  adventure began. Since the first minute\
  \ everything was challenging.\nWe almost lost the flight. We had very little time\
  \ to do the check in, and when it was time to get on board we were not there. They\
  \ started calling our names. I was desperated, so we ran. Before getting on to the\
  \ plane they asked for our passport and the plane ticket, and also the permission,\
  \ cause we were not adults. My friend passed wery quickly, but as i heard my name\
  \ again on th loudspeaker, the man who worked there kept reading my permission very\
  \ patiently. It got me on my nerves. But we did it, we passed the first test of\
  \ this trip.\nAlready on the plane we were relax, i slept during all the flight,\
  \ until we arrived to New York. It was just a stopover, our finally destination\
  \ was Boston. We just had to wait a few hours in the big apple, but things got complicated.\
  \ We were not expecting this trip to be full of dares. \nThere was a big snowstorm\
  \ so our connection flight got cancelled. They told us that probabbly the plane\
  \ would not take off until the next day. We were terrified. We called our parents,\
  \ they tried to find a solution but it was difficult being so far away. \nWhen we\
  \ talked  with the staff of the airport they gave us two options: we could stay\
  \ the night in New York in a hotel or we could go to another airport in which there\
  \ was a flight with destination to Boston later. We choose the second one.\nThey\
  \ gave us some tickets for a transfer to move to the other airport, and then we\
  \ waited for it. While waiting we met an african guy who lived in boston, who was\
  \ coming with us in the transfer. He helped us a lot cause he knew we were young,\
  \ he guided us. \nWhen we arrived to that other airport we had a big number of hours\
  \ to wait until the flight took off so we ate and we walked around. There we met\
  \ a korean girl who was going to study in Harvard, and later a korean guy. They\
  \ did not know each other, but they got really close very fast. I think he was in\
  \ love with her, but that is not the point in this story.\nWhen the time to take\
  \ off was getting closer we sat in front of the departure door so we did not took\
  \ the risk to loose it, or if something happened we would get to know. But bad things\
  \ happened again. \nIt was almost time to get in the plane and the screen did not\
  \ say Boston. We asked, but had no answer . After a while we noticed we had an email\
  \ saying that the departure door changed. It was already time to get on board, so\
  \ again, we ran. Luckily we did it again, and we finally got to Boston where we\
  \ had an amazing time.\nWe met people from all around the world, we did very close\
  \ friends, and we learned lot of stuff. This whole experience really made me grew\
  \ up and also completely change my life and the way i see it."
