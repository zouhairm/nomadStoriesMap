Text: "Every Italian I have ever met has talked to me about Italian food. No, every\
  \ Italian I have ever met has talked to me MOSTLY about Italian food, and maybe\
  \ then some other things. And I have met many Italians: in Edinburgh, I lived, an\
  \ Indian, with a group of more than twenty Italians. I've been to Italy several\
  \ times, hosted by students and their families. Every culture has their own food\
  \ and traditions, but what is it about the Italians that makes them incessantly\
  \ converse about their food? \n\nIn Bologna recently, I asked my hostess, Martina,\
  \ who shook her head, a dreamy look on her face; \"It is a way to stay with people,\
  \ food. If you love someone, you cook for them. It is the most important moment\
  \ of the day\" That was evident; everywhere I went, my hosts and friends were delighted\
  \ that they could cook for me. In Naples, we spent long hours preparing dinner for\
  \ the evening, and it's not just the final meal, but the cooking time spent together,\
  \ that brings you closer. \"We grow up with this love for food and pass it on to\
  \ the next generation,\" Martina said. \n\nThis is especially significant in the\
  \ time of technology which makes lives so fast we want to grab-n-go. \"I don't understand,\"\
  \ my host in Torino Gabriele says, \"the Dutch always want to grab a sandwich and\
  \ go. They don't want to think about food for too long, they think it's a stealing\
  \ of their time. I think not thinking about food is a stealing of your time!\" \n\
  \nThis intense love for food resonates strongly all across, as Roberto, our other\
  \ host told me, \"Food here is a religion. If you don't cook by the correct recipe,\
  \ people take it personally. Pizza cannot have pineapple! Pizza was born in Napoli\
  \ with Mozarella and tomatoes, and that is what it must contain!\" A hilarious example\
  \ of this was when we sat down for lunch at a restaurant. An Egyptian friend of\
  \ mine (his first time in Italy) looked at the pizza he was served and found it\
  \ too bland; he asked the waiter if he could have some mayonnaise. The waiter said\
  \ no and walked off. \nThe Napolitan family who hosted us in Naples refused to let\
  \ him add vinegar to his pasta, despite several requests. \n\n\"Food really binds\
  \ our country together you know,\" Martina said, \"from north to the south, each\
  \ region is so different, with different dialects and traditions. But food is the\
  \ connection between us; when we meet someone we don't know, we break the ice by\
  \ talking about food.\" It sounds similar to the British always talking about the\
  \ weather. \n\nItaly, lying as it does at the heart of the Mediterranean, actually\
  \ had a huge advantage because since the time of exploration, they could always\
  \ import food from different parts of the world, being so accessible. Food in Italy\
  \ stands for love, for relaxing with friends, for using your hands to make something\
  \ from scratch in this age of clickbait; the love for food extends far beyond just\
  \ eating something flavourful or tasty. It is a way of expression in Italy, a way\
  \ to show that I miss you and I care for you. \"Food is a language here,\" said\
  \ Gabriele. \n\nA weekend Italian dinner, together with friends or family, would\
  \ easily last 3-4 hours. Starting with aperitivo including some salami and wine,\
  \ pasta or pizza, bread, dessert, coffee, prosecco or limoncello, and finally another\
  \ round of sweets, everything about food is well appreciated and relished at the\
  \ deepest possible level. \n\n\"Without enjoying food, or eating food just to fill\
  \ your stomach, that is the saddest thing for me,\" said Roberto, \"You have to\
  \ know the pleasure of food!\""
