Text: "I enjoy sitting on the cusp of. Dawn and dusk, the cusp of day and night. The\
  \ cusp of a new song.  I guess it's the anticipation. My partner, Ben, and I were\
  \ on the cusp of a Sri Lankan holiday. We were headed for Galle Fort from Colombo\
  \ airport. Our driver, Rohan, took us along a route that offered lush scenery and\
  \ showcased stunning Sri Lankan architecture. I was absorbing the surrounds with\
  \ desaturated senses. We were on the tail end of thirty-six hours of flight delays,\
  \ pithy food vouchers, bench-sleeping, and flight-board cursing. I was excited yet\
  \ a little apprehensive about this trip. Riots and incursions between the Sinhalese\
  \ and Muslims had just recently erupted. In addition to civil hostility around the\
  \ globe resentment for Westerners often runs deep. At times rightly so. Sometimes\
  \ the animosity is a thin film on the surface, sometimes it\u2019s a volatile gushing.\n\
  \nWe arrived at our accommodation, The Stairway, in Galle Fort. We were reservedly\
  \ greeted by three Sri Lankan men. A single outdoor area served as a restaurant,\
  \ kitchen and makeshift office. Where were the rooms? My hint of concern morphed\
  \ into a layer cake of confusion. Wasn\u2019t this establishment a restaurant as\
  \ well? Are we intruding on someone\u2019s living quarters? How do we come and go\
  \ as we please without restaurant patrons thinking we are the hired entertainment?\
  \  We were led into a room and my monkey mind dissipated as I absorbed the beautiful\
  \ decor.  A blend of shabby chic meets Mondrian meets Francis of Assisi. Relief\
  \ flowed as we were shown an exit door on the other side so we could come and go\
  \ as we pleased. We were given the option of an American or traditional Sri Lankan\
  \ breakfast the following day. \u201CSri Lankan\u201D we replied apprehensively\
  \ and in unison. And then we slept, oh how we slept, for a timeframe that matched\
  \ our transit time to arrive there. \n\nEyes wide shut. Eyes wide open. What is\
  \ that sound? Ben's eyes were pointing lasers at the ceiling, just as mine had a\
  \ moment ago. I checked my mobile for the time, 5am. A male voice was projecting\
  \ Muslim prayer through the streets. My initial feeling was a leaching Black Hawk\
  \ Down kind of panic. A few ticks of the second hand of a proverbial clock and the\
  \ panic feeling melted away to awe and wonderment. The kind that is familiarly addictive\
  \ to globe-trotters and vagabonds alike. Neither of us wanted to shift out of this\
  \ unexpected yet pleasant feeling. We would normally find audio of that nature alienating,\
  \ even haunting. Perhaps we were just uninitiated.\n\nMorning light had arrived\
  \ and we sat on the open terrace area of The Stairway, an area I now viewed with\
  \ soft eyes. We drank Sri-Lankan coffee while sweating it out each pore, more-ish\
  \ egg-hoppers, delicious curries and a platter of tropical fruits. The unexpected\
  \ dishes paired so nicely with the unfolding friendliness of the owner. He who I\
  \ had cautiously cordoned the day before. The conversation gently petered out and\
  \ he humbly left us to enjoy our multi-course breakfast. We looked down on the quaint\
  \ laneways framed with Dutch provincial buildings. We noticed a building of stunning\
  \ baroque architecture with Islamic detailing.\n\nBreakfast was done and our driver,\
  \ Rohan, greeted us at the top of the stairway. He sported a beaming smile and was\
  \ enviously absent of sweat. Rohan described how Sri Lankans tend to embrace a primitive\
  \ and free lifestyle. This resonated strongly with my current allergies to the corporate\
  \ lifestyle. Societal shackles, no thank you. He also pointed out that the building\
  \ we had noticed earlier was the Meeran Mosque. This is where the Muslim prayer\
  \ call we heard at the ungodly (in this case godly) hour of 5 am had originated.\n\
  \nThere has been significant conflict on this teardrop island. No country gets an\
  \ A+ for its history. As our trip unfolded, akin to that audible prayer, the remaining\
  \ regions of Sri Lanka we explored enveloped us with gentle smiles, kind gestures\
  \ and a refreshing love for the modest and the traditional - the B side to the unrest\
  \ broadcast to the world."
