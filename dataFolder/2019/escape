Text: "Unxepected journey,while I'm run away from everything.\n\nI\u2019ve never been\
  \ in this situation before.This is my first time being like this.I\u2019m too overthinking\
  \ and the worst thing is,my relationship is not in good condition.I almost broke\
  \ up with my boyfriend.I really don\u2019t know what to do,I can\u2019t even think\
  \ about anything,I feel so blank.I want to go somewhere,I need to calm my self,and\
  \ fresh my mind.So,I pack my clothes,put my camera around my neck,pack my important\
  \ things,and I\u2019m wearing my favourite jeans with a pink t shirt,also my lovely\
  \ white converse and baseball cap.And I go to the station and ready for my journey.\n\
  I\u2019m a student in Jogjakarta,Indonesia.And the nearest city to explore is Solo.It\
  \ take 1 hours from Jogja by train.I\u2019ve never go there before,so I want to\
  \ explore Solo,while I resfreshing my mind.I\u2019m using the local train,it cost\
  \ 8,000 Rupiah,and we can go at the same time we buy the ticket.I don\u2019t have\
  \ any plan for what to do,or where to go in Solo,I just want to enjoy my time,just\
  \ keep walking and exploring. Fortunately,I got some seat in the train,If I\u2019\
  m not,I\u2019ll stand for 1 hours until arrived at Solo.The sounds of the train\
  \ wheel when it touches the railway track make me want to take a rest for a minute\
  \ before exploring Solo.\nAfter arrived at Solo,I\u2019m still don\u2019t know what\
  \ to do,and where to go.So I walk to exit way,and just keep walkin without even\
  \ know where is my destination.Solo is a beautiful city and has a refreshing air,and\
  \ It\u2019s good for my mind.In the middle of my journey,I saw some unique statue,and\
  \ It\u2019s the sign of Laweyan Village,which is the batik village in Solo.So I\
  \ follow the sign to go to Laweyan Village.In the left side of the road,there are\
  \ some beautiful old buildings and it\u2019s get renovated,maybe it\u2019s the time\
  \ to change the old one with the new one,but I hope that\u2019s not gonna happen\
  \ in my relationship.\nI stop at some cafe,I feel so thirsty in because I\u2019\
  ve been walking for 20 minutes.Anyway I\u2019m just bring 50,000 Rupiah or just\
  \ 3.5 USD.Then I buy a Thai Tea.I realy like Thai Tea!Because sometimes,it\u2019\
  s little bit bitter,but sometimes it can be sweet,just like my relationship.I\u2019\
  m waiting for my order in table number 1,and I saw some old snack that I always\
  \ buy when I was kid!That is Arum Manis or Cotton CandyI\u2019m really enjoy it\
  \ because that is so delicious!\nMy close friend,Thori,who stay in Solo offreing\
  \ to guide me to explore Solo,so she pick me with her motorcycle and we start exploring\
  \ Solo,I say to her that  I need to go to someplaces where I can refresh my mind,I\
  \ need someplace which is have a lot of plants,and animal.So we go to Balekambang\
  \ Park,it\u2019s located in the heart of Solo,in it\u2019s one of the must visit\
  \ destination in Solo.\nAfter we arrived,I\u2019m so amaze with this Park,because\
  \ it\u2019s a big park,with a lot of big green plants,and they have some animals\
  \ too,like deer,swan,monkey and fish.We walk  around the park,I saw two deers lean\
  \ on each others,and it\u2019s make me remember to my boyfriend.I realize,I missed\
  \ him.We stop at the playground,and we sit in the swinger.I told her about my problem\
  \ with my boyfriend,and after that she said \u2018 I know you are tired,but you\
  \ still love him right?I\u2019m sure that he can changes,and I know he is not just\
  \ your boyfriend but also your bestfriend,he is your home,right?I think that you\
  \ just need a time to refresh your mind,your body,your soul,and don\u2019t forget\
  \ about your own happiness because you deserve to be happy.\nAnd what she said was\
  \ right,I need a time to refresh my mind,and Balekambang Park success make me refresh\
  \ my mind,body,and soul.And our journey today is ended here,because the sky is geeting\
  \ dark,and we need to take a rest for our next journey."
