Text: "As the airport doors opened in Amritsar, the heat, smell and sound of India\
  \ was like a punch in the face. Car horns blending into a constant drone in the\
  \ background, taxi drivers jostling each other to be the first to reach the trickle\
  \ of shell shocked arrivals and a heat, so humid, it almost settled on your shoulders\
  \ like a wet hug.\nAfter being snapped up instantly by a driver, and ushered into\
  \ a banged up old car that definitely wouldn\u2019t have passed a roadworthy certificate\
  \ since 1980, I was on my way.\n\nMy destination was The Golden Temple of Amritsar,\
  \ a holy place of the Sikh religion.\nAs it\u2019s name suggests, The Golden Temple\
  \ is indeed entirely made from and covered in gold. It is a truly impressive sight\
  \ to see, particularly at night, when the light reflects onto the lake surrounding\
  \ it and creates an incredible atmosphere.\nSikh\u2019s from all around the country\
  \ come to witness it\u2019s beauty and also to bathe in the water, as legend states\
  \ that it can cure skin ailments.\nArriving at the temple complex was an intimidating\
  \ sight. Thousands of people are fed here each day, and free accommodation is given\
  \ to any who ask. It was here, that I had planned to stay for my first night in\
  \ India.\n\nLeaving the safety of my taxi, I joined the throngs entering, and added\
  \ my flip flops to the hundreds strewn across the stairs and into the street. I\
  \ doubted very much if I would see them again.\nAs I entered the gate, I caught\
  \ my first glimpse of the place. It is a huge square lake complex, surrounded by\
  \ buildings and paved in concrete up to the water\u2019s edge. The temple itself\
  \ is in the centre of the water and reached by a walkway. \nPeople were everywhere.\
  \ Tradition states that Sikh men can never cut their hair, so as young boys, they\
  \ look quite comical with a bun rolled on the very top of their heads and covered\
  \ with a small cloth. \nFor men, this look is very striking, big bushy beards coupled\
  \ with large turbans of differing colours covering their hair. They also wear a\
  \ chola; a matching pair of pants and a long belted shirt. At the temple, many of\
  \ the men had haltered a huge machete style sword at their waists. It was an intimidating\
  \ sight.\n\nAs I neared the water\u2019s edge, I noticed that it had a faint odour.\
  \ Up close, it did not look like it could cure a skin ailment, quite the opposite.\
  \ It had a creamy green film on top, broken by small pieces of floating plastic.\
  \ Yet, I was surrounded by people kneeling at the waters edge to wash their hands\
  \ and face, keen to be touched by such a holy substance.\nContinuing on, I followed\
  \ the signs for accommodation. This was another huge concrete structure at the opposite\
  \ end from the temple called the Langar. On average 40,000 people are fed here every\
  \ day, and that number can swell to 100,000 on holidays. Chaos reigned. Huge crowds\
  \ of people impatiently waiting and pushing towards small windows labelled, \u2018\
  Indian\u2019 and \u2018Foreigner\u2019. After much jostling, I finally made it up\
  \ to speak to an impatient man, who wrote down my name, nationality and gestured\
  \ vaguely to the right and mumbled something about a foreign section.\n\nBy this\
  \ time, night had already settled and as I walked down the outside hall, I stepped\
  \ over the bodies of sleepers, some still wearing their swords stubbornly on their\
  \ hips.\nAfter reaching my room, and finding a small free mattress pushed up against\
  \ a corner, I gratefully settled in for the night. \nFor me, the size and scope\
  \ of the temple and langar had left me feelingslightly shocked and in awe. I lay\
  \ there listening to the unfamiliar sound of Punjabi, as thousands of people chattered,\
  \ ate and snored around me, with the ever constant hum of beeping tuk tuks outside\
  \ in the night. I thought, perhaps, when I was planning my next trip, I\u2019d give\
  \ myself at least one night in a hostel first, to give my poor jet lagged brain\
  \ a chance to acclimatise first."
