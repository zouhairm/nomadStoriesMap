Text: "Venice:  A city that\u2019s on everyone\u2019s bucket list, though few know\
  \ why. \nI ventured there alone, and was hosted by someone I met via Couchsurfing.\
  \ He was an older man (\u201CAndrea\u201D) who seemed a veteran couchsurfer, and\
  \ was more than willing to show me around the city. He picked me up from the train\
  \ station and immediately let me know he had the whole day planned out. We first\
  \ went to his home outside of Venice; he lived in a small village (Dolo) known for\
  \ its high-end shoe factories. He made us lunch (grilled salmon, pasta with white\
  \ cheese, tomato with mozzarella and vinaigrette, and white wine to drink) while\
  \ we listened to old soul and blues music. \nAfter lunch, we drove to Venezia. As\
  \ I said before, I knew very little about the town, so I had no visual or cultural\
  \ expectations before going. In addition, there were no specific places or landmarks\
  \ I wished to see so I was as happy to follow Andrea as he was to lead the way.\
  \ Due to my lack of knowledge about the city, everything felt surreal. Andrea preferred\
  \ to take me around the areas less inhabited by tourists, so I was able to observe\
  \ Venice\u2019s true personality. Simple and serene....there were no grand buildings\
  \ or bright lights. The tiny canals, the small alleyways, the winding paths...it\
  \ is a maze of beauty and history that would inspire even the weariest of artists.\
  \ [I am not a history major, nor a literary enthusiast, but there were times when\
  \ I had to stop in front of a building so that I could admire all its cracks...to\
  \ me, they seemed like\nbattle scars born from stories yet to be told. I would also\
  \ look into the windows to see what they reflected...imagining all the people that\
  \ have passed by them. Were they from Venice? Were they visiting? What lives were\
  \ they living? I felt like I was in a dream...wandering around some old wonderland\
  \ and admiring all its timeworn buildings.]\nEventually we ventured to the more\
  \ touristy areas, and though most popular landmarks can give off a very commercialized\
  \ feeling, the crowds did nothing to hinder the centuries-old beauty of the city.\
  \ From Rialto Bridge to the Piazza San Marco, Venice is not lacking in awe-inspiring\
  \ scenery. The gondolas floating by, the color and contrast between the old and\
  \ the new buildings, the music of a nearby beggar playing the accordion, and the\
  \ multilingual chatter of the\ntourists...I couldn\u2019t help but think that this\
  \ is the kind of experience that poets and musicians write about. As the sun went\
  \ down, the lovers came out and one only had to turn to one direction to see couples\
  \ in a deep embrace. And why wouldn\u2019t they be? Standing at the bridge and watching\
  \ the lights bounce off the water while gondolieri sang to their final passengers,\
  \ I felt as if I was in a romantic movie, blending into the Venetian background\
  \ while the co-stars expressed their love through kisses and starry eyes. Eventually,\
  \ walking along the cobblestone roads under the dim lights down the narrow alleys,\
  \ even Andrea and I succumbed to the amorous atmosphere and locked arms while wrapping\
  \ up our night.\nAfter a day of long walks, pictures, and aperitivos we drove back\
  \ to Andrea\u2019s home where we drank tea, ate chocolate, and watched TV. It was\
  \ a very uneventful day, though not in a bad way. My impression of Venice was not\
  \ breathtaking, in the sense that it had a very familiar feeling. I felt as if I\
  \ could be at home in this tiny town. Even the tourist destinations were simple\
  \ and serene. I appreciated Andrea for showing\nme the town from a local\u2019s\
  \ perspective rather than from a traveler\u2019s perspective. And I appreciate Venice\
  \ for opening its arms to us strangers. Though we may never come to completely value\
  \ the whole history upon which the city was constructed, my hope is that the experience\
  \ will leave us a bit more cultured and more appreciative of historical beauty."
