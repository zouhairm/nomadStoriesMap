Text: "Today is the day I seasoned the waters of Antarctica with a bit of chocolate\
  \ flavor and turned my feet into fudgesicles during the infamous \u201CPolar Plunge\u201D\
  .  Now this is not for the faint at heart and nor is the journey to get to this\
  \ winter wonderland. I took three flights and three taxis to get to my expedition\
  \ ship in Ushuaia, Argentina; and I was still two days away from checking off the\
  \ final destination on my travel bucket list.  \n\nThey say it\u2019s all about\
  \ the journey and mine was quite the adventure. The \u201CDrake Passage\u201D made\
  \ my bed feel like a simulated ride! Nightly restroom visits were like being inside\
  \ of a video game. The game\u2019s objective was to stay upright and avoid smashing\
  \ fingers in the swinging doors.  I set myself up for failure. Seven thousand dollars\
  \ gets you a room with a bunk bed and a roommate. The top bunk had a window, so\
  \ I picked the penthouse bed with the ocean view. The joke was on me! By day three\
  \ I implemented the no fluids two hours before bedtime rule, because I couldn\u2019\
  t keep risking my life for bladder relief.  I needed to live to participate in the\
  \ polar plunge!\n\nNow, it must be said that this activity is actually offered in\
  \ my hometown, Chicago.  However, doing the activity here in Antarctica is like\
  \ a fairytale.  There is nothing magical about Lake Michigan, so jumping in just\
  \ sounds stupid!  Antarctica however is an enchanted place; A sight many only experience\
  \ in Disney movies. Imagine pristine waters surrounded by penguins and snow-capped\
  \ glaciers.  Chicago participants probably plunge next to Jewel Osco bags and Coca-Cola\
  \ cans.  Where is the magic in that?\n\n We initiate the experience with a light\
  \ hike. I don\u2019t know if the intention was to get our blood flowing for the\
  \ activity or give us a chance to chicken out, but at 10:50am everyone gathered\
  \ around on the beach for the big show. We all just stood there waiting to see who\
  \ had the guts to go first and suddenly, some guy strips down to his birthday suit.\
  \ Butt Cheeks and testicles is all I remember! He darted into the icy waters of\
  \ Antarctica, took a dip, and emerged victorious! It appeared that the penguins\
  \ in the water had the sudden urge to get out when he ran in naked! After this adventurous\
  \ soul set the tone, it wasn\u2019t difficult for anyone else to take on the challenge.\
  \ Several girls wanted to plunge as a group, so they recruited me to join the crew.\
  \ Five of us ran in together with the ship in front of us, snowcapped glaciers around\
  \ us, and Gentoo penguins behind us. It was awesome until I realized that I couldn\u2019\
  t feel my toes! Numbness turned into extreme pain. Pebbles felt like glass.  My\
  \ body remained hot from the hiking; however, my feet turned into fudgesicles instantly\
  \ once they hit the water. My feet seemed to have gone on strike once I got knee\
  \ deep into the water. They were refusing to carry me. I used every bit of determination\
  \ within to make it back to dry land. There were staff members waiting on the shore\
  \ for us with towels and they had the zodiac boats all ready to go to wisk us back\
  \ to the ship before frostbite ensued. I carried a smile coupled with a feeling\
  \ of liberation as I ran to my room for a shower. The feeling in my feet didn\u2019\
  t come back for another thirty minutes, but It didn\u2019t even bother me.  Feet\
  \ are overrated! The only thing that mattered to me that day was being inducted\
  \ into the elite group of Antarctic polar plungers. Unlike the fudgesicle feet I\
  \ created, I want this memory to live forever!"
