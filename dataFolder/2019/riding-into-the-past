Text: "It\u2019s only after we climb off the back of the pick-up truck and actually\
  \ see the horses that I suddenly remember: I am SERIOUSLY afraid of horses, and\
  \ this rag-tag bunch of ponies isn\u2019t inspiring any sense of security in me.\
  \ \n\nSan Cristobal de las Casas is a beautiful town. So tiny that you can walk\
  \ from one end to the other in under an hour. It sits in a valley and is bookended\
  \ by a small church atop a hill on either side. You climb the staircase to one church\
  \ and look straight across to the other church. Like other Mexican towns we\u2019\
  ve visited it is centred around a lively town square and is an amazing place to\
  \ base yourself while exploring more of the Chiapas region. \n\nI agree to horse-riding,\
  \ mainly lured by the destination. Templo de San Juan in San Juan de Chamula, a\
  \ small church which combines local Tzotzil Mayan traditions with Catholicism, a\
  \ blend that oddly makes a lot of sense when you see it. It\u2019s forbidden to\
  \ take photos inside the church, but I hear rumours that sometimes visitors see\
  \ church-goers completing rituals involving eggs, or even the killing of a chicken.\
  \ I\u2019m definitely intrigued. \n\nBut first, the horses. After we\u2019re dropped\
  \ off next to our new hooved friends, our two Spanish tour guides allocate us different\
  \ horses. \nMine turns out to be a troublemaker. He cants away whenever another\
  \ horse draws near. I can\u2019t control his trajectory as he insists on trotting\
  \ down the middle of the road, ignoring approaching cars. He has a tendency to stop\
  \ to graze. A hungry boy. I\u2019m not used to the saddle and I have a strong feeling\
  \ that my feet aren\u2019t properly positioned in the stirrups. At one point, my\
  \ horse slips off the road into the grass because he\u2019s so eagerly munching\
  \ away that he doesn\u2019t seem to notice where he\u2019s putting his feet. I\u2019\
  m not entirely sure I\u2019m going to make it to San Juan de Chamula in one piece.\n\
  \nBut of course I do. And standing in San Juan de Chamula\u2019s town square I am\
  \ impressed by the bright blue church, although it doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly\
  \ special compared to churches we\u2019ve seen in other places. As we approach,\
  \ it starts to rain. \n\nThe moment we step into the church I feel calm. I know\
  \ it was worth the trip.  It\u2019s dimly lit and there are no pews. the floor of\
  \ the church is covered in dry pine needles. Throughout the church, patrons have\
  \ cleared space for themselves and their candles. Tall, thin wax candles that have\
  \ been stuck to the floor with wax, often several in a row. All this fire around\
  \ the pine needles should make me nervous, but it\u2019s serene.\nThere\u2019s a\
  \ low hum in the air made up of various prayers throughout the church. The stained\
  \ glass windows and pulpit at the front remind us of the church\u2019s original\
  \ purpose; as does the statue of Christ on a large crucifix. But the colonial outer\
  \ of the church is defied inside by the small rituals being carried out inside.\
  \ \n\nI watch one woman sweep aside pine needles to place her candles and begin\
  \ something involving eggs waved over the candles. Elsewhere I see people clearing\
  \ wax off the floor from burnt-out candles and sweeping the pine needles back in\
  \ place. My friend claims he sees a family with a chicken, but I don\u2019t see\
  \ it. Instead I\u2019m struck by how timeless everything feels. This strange amalgamation\
  \ of vastly different religions somehow makes complete sense here.\nWe watch as\
  \ the usual afternoon storm drenches the square. It stops in time to return to our\
  \ horses, though I am nervous re-mounting my troublemaker for the 10km trek back\
  \ to San Cristobal.\n\nI survive the return trip, and I think my horse is just as\
  \ eager as I am to get home. As we near the end of the road, the horse starts going\
  \ faster, sometimes slipping on its ankles on the road, scaring me more each time.\
  \ But I can\u2019t stop reflecting on the sight of the brightly coloured church\
  \ framed against a stormy sky, and the timeless serenity inside."
