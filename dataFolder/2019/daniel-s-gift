Text: "\u201CHe died last night, I believe\u201D I heard the woman in front whisper\
  \ earnestly in her British accent. \u201CHe was a legend. So sad. The world lost\
  \ a gem\u201D her friend responded. I was curious, but not enough to ask. Instead,\
  \ I sat back in my seat and enjoyed the contrasting scenery; bright pearly white\
  \ mounds glistening exceptionally against a beaming blue back drop. The sky was\
  \ cloudless & seemed infinite. I was shaken out of my hazy, warm day dream by four\
  \ words spoken behind me this time. \u201CNelson Mandela passed away\u201D\nAs a\
  \ South African, sitting in a safari vehicle deep within the Namib desert with a\
  \ group of people hailing from all over the world,  I felt a sense of guilt and\
  \ dread. Guilt because I was enjoying my great Namibian road trip without my mobile\
  \ phone while everyone back home was mourning, dread because he was the glue that\
  \ held our fragmented country together, or so we believed.\nThe rest of the day\
  \ seemed to go by in slow motion, I took a few photos of a sand snake that made\
  \ beautiful patterns as it slithered right next to where I was sitting. The sombre\
  \ air around us was broken by our tour guide cracking jokes about how he is actually\
  \ Kryptonian because he survived malaria. \nWe headed back to the town where it\
  \ seemed to permamnently be overcast, but not the dismal kind. The German architecture\
  \ made  Swakopmund seem all the more mystical & abounding. It\u2019s big enough\
  \ to never be bored and always find a different activity to do or place to explore\
  \ and small enough to do on foot. On my way to the beach the following morning,\
  \ I met a tall young man named Daniel. He approached me with the biggest smile and\
  \ a string of tiny brown balls in his hand. \u201CWhat is your name?\u201D I looked\
  \ around, a bit uncomfortable. \u201CWhy?\u201D He takes out some small carving\
  \ instrument and fiddled with the brown ball. Within seconds, three out of the famous\
  \ big five is carved on this tiny canvas, which he later explains is a nut that\
  \ is found on Makalani Palms. I tell him my name and he carves it intricately into\
  \ the nut and hands it to me on a string \u201Cyour new key ring\u201D he smiles.\n\
  \ He takes a walk with me down to the jetty and explains that he is from the Herero\
  \ tribe. We spoke about Tata Madiba and cried. Even as a Namibian, he felt the loss\
  \ and I understood why. I explained what ancestral trauma was and that the Herero\
  \ genocide is akin to what happened to my parents and grandparents during apartheid.\
  \ We both lay on the warm wooden planks, lamenting the loss of a freedom fighter\
  \ and wondered what the world would be like post his death. The sun starts to set,\
  \ leaving a shimmer of gold on the wild ocean. We hear the water crash beneath us\
  \ as we speak about our similarities. We were the same age. I was studying psychology,\
  \ he was an artist. He invited me to his home to watch the memorial service and\
  \ I would have gone had I not planned to be in Sossusvlei the following week. \n\
  The next morning, I ran into Daniel by chance.  It was my last day there so I had\
  \ to go try the town\u2019s famous pastries. I asked whether he had any more Makalani\
  \ Palm nuts and he sat with me in the coffee shop for around an hour, carving out\
  \ all my family and friends\u2019 names. \nAs I walked outside, a man sitting on\
  \ the floor talking in delightful clicks asked me to sit down as he started to draw\
  \ me in charcoal on a large white page. He captured my sad eyes and I thanked him.\
  \ I said goodbye to my two new friends with a self portrait portraying grief and\
  \ a filled heart. As I walked away, I felt pride and promise. A legend had died\
  \ and left us with a legacy and I had a handful of new key rings for everyone at\
  \ home to unlock their inner Madiba\u2019s, and keep striving for greatness."
