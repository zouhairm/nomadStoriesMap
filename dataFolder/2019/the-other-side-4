Text: "The narrow bridge that gives access to Vicu\xF1a in Chile was certainly meant\
  \ for horse-drawn vehicles, even though Don Quixote and his squire Sancho Panza\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be able to cross it side by side. Fortunately, no car was coming\
  \ from the other side when my parents and I - not without effort - crossed it with\
  \ the tiny car we rented. We were only there to visit a museum, have lunch, and\
  \ leave. But once you get to the other side nothing is the same anymore.\nOur first\
  \ stop in Vicu\xF1a was Nobel Prize in Literature laureate Gabriela Mistral\u2019\
  s former house and museum. Artists\u2019 museums are usually in their houses and\
  \ don\u2019t always reflect their work. In Mistral\u2019s museum\u2019s case it\
  \ was impossible not to relate her poems to the place where she lived. Gabriela\
  \ considered the mountains her mother: Vicu\xF1a is hidden in the middle of them\
  \ and it feels as if the peaks were looking after its inhabitants. When you look\
  \ up, just like Mistral said, the sky looks like a huge heart shaped by the mountains,\
  \ but frequently bitter to the poet when she was without her loved one. Her humble\
  \ house is the very beginning of a museum full of texts that have paved the way\
  \ for a different perspective towards teaching, bringing light to the children\u2019\
  s reality. There are some of her everyday objects as well, and in the end you may\
  \ find the letters Gabriela wrote to her beloved Doris Dana. After that there is\
  \ a garden where I had apricots dangling from their tree for the first time (I had\
  \ only seen them dried). Finally, when leaving the museum I realized that all of\
  \ the metaphors within her poems had yet another meaning for me, and every verse\
  \ was unique thanks to the experience of being in that same place where she was\
  \ born, worked as a teacher and saw nature and feelings coexisting. Life would always\
  \ run through her words\u2019 veins. \nLater on, we went to a traditional store\
  \ of chilean empanadas. The owner explained precisely what every flavor was about,\
  \ and how much she struggled to design every empanada\u2019s shape: \u201CI am an\
  \ artisan\u201D, she said. Indeed, all of her empanadas were specially designed\
  \ to relate to its flavor. By then I didn\u2019t realize the store\u2019s slogan\
  \ was \u201CEl Arte-Sano\u201D, where we get a little lost in translation because\
  \ it stands for \u201Cthe art-sane\u201D. Interestingly, I felt much better after\
  \ I ate those, not as if I only had ended my hunger but also healed my spirit. \u201C\
  Why do I feel like this?\u201D, I wondered. The owner would make many questions,\
  \ but I do not remember most of them. All I know is that she would always repeat\
  \ Mistral\u2019s name and smile at us.\nAs we were leaving Vicu\xF1a, I understood\
  \ something. In the beginning of Miguel de Cervantes\u2019 masterpiece Don Quixote\
  \ a book named La Araucana by Alonso de Ercilla is mentioned and praised. It is\
  \ about the war between the Spanish and Mapuche people. All of the books and stories\
  \ I grew up with were about conquer and discovery, about the uncivilized New World\
  \ versus the culture from abroad. Vicu\xF1a gave birth to a poet who not only wrote\
  \ about love with no boundaries, nature with its mysteries and kids taught through\
  \ affection, but also has appraised all of her ancestors. I realized Gabriela gave\
  \ voice to all of us South-American people, the children and grandchildren of a\
  \ society characterized by pain and a historical erasure. As I crossed the bridge\
  \ again I was very sure her poems were like \u201CEl Arte-Sano\u201D. They were\
  \ art and healing."
