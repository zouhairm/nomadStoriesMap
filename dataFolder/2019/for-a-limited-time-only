Text: "On a recent trip to Hong Kong, I came across a newspaper ad for a popular Lantau\
  \ dolphin boat cruise that could have been written by a sideshow carnie. \n\t\"\
  Be amazed! Rare pink dolphins, found between Hong Kong and Macau, live within a\
  \ few kilometers of one of the world's busiest shopping centers.\u201D\n       \
  \  Intrigued, I went on the cruise, hoping luck would smile on me. It did! Fifteen\
  \ minutes after the boat was out at sea, I saw a dolphin. It was bubblegum pink.\n\
  \         Unfortunately, I later learned that luck doesn't appear to be on the dolphins'\
  \ side. In 2003, there were 187 living in the waters around Lantau; the Hong Kong\
  \ Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department states there were only 47 remaining\
  \ in 2017.  Are the dolphins, (officially known as Sousa chinesis), leaving because\
  \ they don't like shopping? According to the Hong Kong Dolphin Conservation Society,\
  \ perhaps indirectly. Lots of shopping means there are more people who require boat\
  \ and high speed ferry transport to the stores on the various islands that comprise\
  \ Hong Kong. This traffic makes so much underwater noise, the dolphins can no longer\
  \ cope.\n\tThe Conservation Society chairman, Dr. Samuel Hung Ka-yiu says, \"Dolphins\
  \ are acoustic creatures that rely on sound to detect their environment, search\
  \ for food, and communicate.\" Since dolphin moms and babies maintain contact by\
  \ communicating through sound, \"the babies may wander off and get lost when it's\
  \ too noisy.\"\n\tWe humans don't hear well underwater. When we submerge our heads,\
  \ the ocean seems silent because our ears are designed to hear in air and have little\
  \ sensitivity to the medium of water. Dolphins on the other hand, hear very well\
  \ underwater. Hearing is their most finely tuned sense. \n        In the interest\
  \ of dolphin babies, I decided to avoid high speed ferries during my trip to Hong\
  \ Kong. It seemed the least I could do.\n \t Unfortunately, the territorial waters\
  \ of Hong Kong are not only loud, they are highly contaminated with mercury and\
  \ other heavy metals. The city is said to have dumped one hundred million gallons\
  \ of semi-processed sewage a day into its harbors. In fact, due to polluted oceans,\
  \ many species of dolphins are in trouble all over the world. In addition to the\
  \ pink dolphin, 9 other species of dolphins are on the verge of extinction.\n \t\
  Because of human actions, the pink dolphins that live in the waters around Hong\
  \ Kong are on the verge of disappearing for good. Such total disregard for the dolphins'\
  \ welfare is odd considering that people claim to like them.  Nor is this affection\
  \ a recent fad. Over the centuries, many friendly and helpful deeds have been ascribed\
  \ to the creatures. Stories of dolphins protecting humans from sharks, preventing\
  \ struggling swimmers from drowning, and rescuing ships in trouble recur often in\
  \ the folklore of many cultures, including that of the Chinese.\n\tSome of the earliest\
  \ stories about dolphins appear in Greek mythology. Apollo, for example, was said\
  \ to have assumed the form of a dolphin when he founded the oracle at Delphi. The\
  \ Greeks, and later the Romans, considered dolphins to be the messengers of the\
  \ gods. The ancients thought that harming a dolphin was a terrible crime that brought\
  \ dreadful luck to the person who had committed it.\n        Not only the ancients\
  \ thought this. A more modern and documented tale of Pelorus Jack describes a Risso\
  \ dolphin who, in the early twentieth century, guided ships through a dangerous\
  \ stretch of the Cook Strait at the northern tip of the South Island of New Zealand.\
  \ As soon as ships arrived in the treacherous water, Jack appeared and guided the\
  \ vessels through. He departed once the ships had made safe passage.\n\uFEFF\uFEFF\
  \uFEFF\uFEFF        One day in 1904, a drunk passenger on the SS Penguin shot at\
  \ Jack as the dolphin was guiding it.  Fortunately, Jack was unharmed and fled.\
  \ Weeks later, he appeared and resumed guiding ships. But Jack refused to guide\
  \ the Penguin ever again and in 1909, it wrecked in the rocky strait.\n\tSo what\
  \ will become of us humans--we who kill dolphins on a grand scale, including the\
  \ amazing bubble gum pink ones? The gods don't like when their messengers are killed."
