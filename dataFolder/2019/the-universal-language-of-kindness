Text: "English is the only language I know. It is not for the lack of trying, but\
  \ my brain is not big enough to hold any more bits of grammar and straggling words.\
  \ English is a useful language though- 1.5 billion people worldwide can speak English.\
  \ I have never had a problem with being understood in a foreign land; there would\
  \ always be an English speaker within earshot. Well, until now.\n\n\u201CCab, cab\u201D\
  \ I desperately motion my hands in a rectangular shape, as if it makes my demands\
  \ clearer. \u201CI need a taxi back to my hotel!\u201D\n\nThe restaurant staff stare\
  \ blankly back at me. They recognise the desperation in my voice, but they do not\
  \ know what to do. I stand at the entrance to the establishment, eyes scanning passing\
  \ cars on the road outside for a big bright TAXI sign, to no avail. I want to go\
  \ back. I am scared.\n\nUzbekistan is a vastly different country from Singapore,\
  \ where I am from. In Singapore, we take technology for granted. We take our efficiency\
  \ and safety and convenience for granted. We can afford to, being one of the most\
  \ affluent countries in the world. There is a rigid organisation of the elements\
  \ that make up society. We are clean, sterile, neat. But here, nothing stays within\
  \ its lines, and more pertinently, taxis go unmarked. Short of me- a helpless 22-year-old-\
  \ stepping into a randomly flagged car, I do not know how to find my way home.\n\
  \nThe hostess takes pity on me and sits me down at an empty table near her station.\
  \ The air is greasy with sizzling fat marbled with meat. This is a popular restaurant.\
  \ The food is considered to be some of the best in the region and boy do the customers\
  \ know it. They come in droves, from tour buses and local cars, following the scent\
  \ of International Recognition. The hostess ignores them. She is rapidly speaking\
  \ on the phone, in a language that trips elegantly over her tongue and dribbles\
  \ down her chin onto her perfectly pressed uniform. I know they speak Russian and\
  \ Uzbek here. I don\u2019t know which she is speaking.\n\nI want to go home. I am\
  \ about to cry. What if I never find my way back? I wonder if they had noticed me\
  \ missing yet. Probably not; we had just met at the airport the night before. 23\
  \ undergraduates, embarking on an exciting learning journey to an exotic land. One\
  \ university staff, apparently not very good at his job seeing as he had left me\
  \ behind after lunch on our very first day. I turn on my phone, but I do not have\
  \ a local SIM card. There is no open WiFi for me to Google Maps my way to safety.\
  \ I am at the mercy of the hostess at this busy restaurant, which, luckily for me,\
  \ happens to be very merciful indeed.\n\nShe passes me her phone and motions me\
  \ to talk. This is her third call since I sat down. \n\n\u201CHello?\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ voice on the other side replies, and relief hits me.\n\n \u201CYou speak English!\u201D\
  \  I squeal, and the neighbouring diners look up from their plovs.\n\n\u201CI do.\
  \ I heard you need help. What is it?\u201D She is not a native speaker.\n\n\u201C\
  I need to get back to my hotel- Hotel International Tashkent. My school group left\
  \ me behind. Can you help me call a taxi?\u201D\n\n\u201CAh, yes, yes, poor child.\
  \ Pass me back to my friend.\u201D I do.\n\n\nThey wave me off, floor staff and\
  \ hostess, lining the entrance steps with plates of undelivered food on their hands.\
  \ I sit at the back of the taksi, trying to paint an easy picture of myself to the\
  \ driver, who is asking me in halting English about life in Singapore. It is safe,\
  \ I tell him. Organised. Sterile. He does not know the meaning of sterile. Clean,\
  \ I say. Singapore is clean.\n\nThe driver gestures to the surrounding roads. \n\
  \n\u201CUzbekistan is sterile!\u2019 He proudly declares.\n\nIt is not. Uzbekistan\
  \ is slightly chaotic, an administrative nightmare, and possesses the kindest souls.\
  \ I don\u2019t correct him.\n\n\u201CUzbekistan is great\u201D, I say instead, fervently.\
  \ He understands."
