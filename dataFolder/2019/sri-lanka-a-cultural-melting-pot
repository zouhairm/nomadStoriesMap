Text: "Seizing the opportunity of the long weekend in January, we took off to Sri\
  \ Lanka. One of the countries which I wanted to visit since long. It was a short\
  \ weekend trip and just for two nights in Colombo, we had our flight on Friday morning\
  \ and reached Colombo in the afternoon. Ayubawan (the traditional Sri Lankan Greeting)\n\
  The highway road from Airport to Mawatha was well maintained and you can sparkling\
  \ cleanliness everywhere. As we start entering the city area of Colombo, we can\
  \ notice the Colonial Style Portuguese Buildings everywhere well maintained with\
  \ nice architectural designs, we can witness a mixture of both old centuries culture\
  \ along with modern culture in Colombo. Well, this is an appreciative factor that\
  \ Colombo has earned , despite that their Buildings dated long back during the Portuguese\
  \ were ruling over this country, they have still maintained their Old-aged buildings\
  \ neat and proper. I stayed in Mawatha and next to my Hotel \u2013 The Steuart By\
  \ Citrus, was the old Dutch Hospital which is now converted into a Shopping mall\
  \ mushrooming several restaurants as well. The Famous Sri Lankan Restaurant \u201C\
  Ministry of Crab\u201D can be found over there and it\u2019s a real must0visit place\
  \ if you every visit Colombo, Cause eating a Huge crab is an Art in Itself.Our Hotel\
  \ was one of those Fancy English type Hotel rated 4 Star and have the Bell desk\
  \ and the Lobby all set-up like in the British Era. We are welcomed warmly with\
  \ a Cocktail Punch . The Corridors are fenced by the wooden racks leading to the\
  \ stairs and most of the decorative pieces displayed on the walls and also kept\
  \ here and there in the Hotel are all antique British furniture. The room was well\
  \ laid with Scottish stripes Carpet which bring out the Scottish feel. The room\
  \ was very spacious and Double King-size bed was provided. Spacious wardrobe to\
  \ keep the cloth and the Mini Bar was filled with goodies. You have a Tea/Coffee\
  \ Maker as well which was available along with all the re-fills in case you get\
  \ a thirst for a Ceylon tea in the middle of the night. Bathroom was spacious too\
  \ and neat and clean, it was well maintained and cleaned for the Guests Convenience.\n\
  Surroundings areas of the hotel are mostly Open Air Pubs, resto-bars  with live\
  \ music concert while the glasses kept on re-filling with ounces of Beer and hot\
  \ mouth-watering appetizers served. You have lots of shopping malls, travel agent\
  \ bureaus, supermarket and also bakery in the surrounding.\nWhether you desire a\
  \ fancy restaurant or a local street one Colombo 01 has it all. Shopping is recommended\
  \ at Opel, Lakshya Handicrafts and also the main Market area is something not to\
  \ be missed if you want to explore the streets of Colombo. In the busy of the Hustle\
  \ Bustle market area, they have a nice architectural Masjid which stand in its all\
  \ its splendour and you just can\u2019t missed it while you are busy exploring the\
  \ roads in Colombo and you have the options of lots of street eateries where you\
  \ can have degustation of Colombo street food.\nBut if you fancy a high-end dinner,\
  \ then Ministry of Crab is a better option where you will have to wear an apron\
  \ and the tools are provided for fighting the big war with your crab. Be it crabs\
  \ or lobsters, you can find any seafood  that you desire over there in Ministry\
  \ of Crabs as well as other restaurants in Colombo.The country has a rich artistic\
  \ tradition, embracing the fine arts, including music, dance, and visual arts. The\
  \ Sri Lankan lifestyle is reflected in the country\u2019s cuisine, festivals, and\
  \ sports. Sri Lankan culture is best known abroad for its cricket, food, holistic\
  \ medicine, religious icons like the Buddhist flag, and cultural exports such as\
  \ tea, cinnamon and gemsas well as tourism. Sri Lankan culture is diverse, as it\
  \ varies from region to region. Sri Lanka has had ties with the Indian subcontinent\
  \ since ancient times. Demographics: Sinhalese 74.8%, Sri Lankan Moors 9.23%, Indian\
  \ Tamil 4.16%, Sri Lankan Tamil 11.21%, Other 0.6%. Sri Lanka climate is tropical\
