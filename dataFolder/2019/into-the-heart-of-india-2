Text: "'Free your soul in some far away roads ' that should  the primary slogan of\
  \ travelling. But like everyone else my motive was different ,all the beautiful\
  \ place I went become just ended as a shining stone to impress others . Rather than\
  \ enjoying myself the personal abnormalities in me ended my trip in taking some\
  \ photos , impressing others and making them jealous . But one day when I planned\
  \ to go for a trip in my vacation everything was changed . I usually spend half\
  \ of ma savings in some resorts . I always complained god for not having  enough\
  \ money to travel across the globe . But I was mistaken money isn't a matter that\
  \ stops you from exploring heart beat of our earth. I took a ticket to delhi \n\
  , the capital of india  with my friends . Our plan was to stay in some good place\
  \ , eat and return . It took almost two and half  days of travelling from kerala\
  \ to delhi. We got birth to sleep everything was good . I was still in my comfort\
  \ zone. We where busy posting photos in social media checked how many likes ee got\
  \ .. we where just a kid ,  sorry kids are better in exploring . Train crossed different\
  \ terrains different cultures and different emotions . But what  our eyes searching\
  \  is a good place to take photos.  But time has much more than we think to teach\
  \ us . We went delhi saw different mosques , churches and temples we slowly turn\
  \ to reality from virtuality. There we could see both  luxurious cars in the world\
  \ and broken poor huts with no trace of safety . But these things are not making\
  \ them down , they are opressed but waves of hope is still high on them , they work\
  \ hard to feed their child , they don't know a world other than their family . Even\
  \ when the problems are hunting them down they are rising again with a. Smile ,\
  \ which is lighter than anything in the world.\nWe started thinking , started feeling\
  \ that humans could think and feel the emotions of same kind. We stopped booking\
  \ bus tickets , hotels . . We started travelling with poor people slept in platforms\
  \ , railway station with them , they are not infectious , they are not hazardous\
  \ .They are humans , we could hear someone talking in our heart.we started talking\
  \ travelling turned us to be an extovert , a good listener .\nWe moved to different\
  \ states of  india , culture languages differs every two kms in india . I began\
  \ to explore . Most of the art forms are tools to enhance their strength, express\
  \ their emotions against their enemies,  some of them are to heal their wounds .There\
  \ is numerous artforms and festivals in where I live but I never tried to see it\
  \ without a pathetic approach. I started exploring , started inhaling the emotions\
  \ ,,  breathe of nature started to see the world with my heart.."
