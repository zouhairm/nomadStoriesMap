Text: "It was only two hours ago that we met Raja. He introduced himself to Ben in\
  \ English before turning to me with a wide-toothed grin and saying \"Khaisa hai\
  \ bhai\", with a tone of familiarity and warmth of a long lost family member. When\
  \ I responded to him in English in an accent that had been polished over a lifetime\
  \ of Western education, his smile immediately turned into a frown and he proceeded\
  \ to get our rides ready.\n\nWe were off. Our obnoxiously loud quad bikes speeding\
  \ through the Indian countryside for our afternoon fix of adrenaline.\n\nExcitement\
  \ soon became melancholy as I caught sight of the seven-year-old me stumbling behind\
  \ my pappa who steadfastly wove between rubber trees, inspecting the quality of\
  \ their sap. Melancholy became numbness as a passing rickshaw carried the sleepy\
  \ laughter of the ten-year-old me, on his way to early sunday mass with my ammachi\
  \ in her orange saree. Numbness became loneliness when we drove past a house adorned\
  \ with rubber sheets hung out to dry and my achachan standing outside in his singlet,\
  \ smoking a beedi and evaluating his hard work. \n\nI pulled myself back to reality\
  \ and asked Raja if we could go faster. After some hesitation, he agreed and we\
  \ were flying through the fields. Raja, Ben and my childhood memories dissolved\
  \ into the background as I felt the freedom of the wind. The same freedom of the\
  \ 19-year-old who had moved to Europe to study philosophy; the 20-year-old who partied\
  \ with reckless abandonment; the 21-year-old who had fallen in love; and the 22-year-old\
  \ who started a company, settled down in Amsterdam and never looked back. \n\nThen\
  \ I heard it. \n\nA loud metallic thump. \n\nSilence.\n\nRaja re-emerged, skidding\
  \ to a halt.\n\nA blood-curdling scream pierced the air. I turned around to see\
  \ Ben crumpled in a heap, pinned down by 400 kilograms of metal, screeching for\
  \ help. \n\nRaja vaulted off his quad and rushed to Ben\u2019s aid. \n\nI just sat\
  \ there. Soaked, speechless and shivering from cold and fear. I was just a child\
  \ who didn\u2019t know who he was, a kid who travelled the world seeking for a non-existent\
  \ home, a boy who always stumbled and stuttered when asked where he was from. A\
  \ 23-year-old who ran away from his past, haunted by the fear of being shunned,\
  \ tormented by a home he'll never find.  \n\nThe next hour was a blur. Ben was bruised\
  \ all over but alive. Raja was quiet but seething with anger and I was drowning\
  \ in guilt but breathing. We dragged our way to a roadside hut, the local mechanic\u2019\
  s home. We sat there, not looking at each other, not speaking, just quietly enveloped\
  \ in our guilt and embarrassment as Raja argued with the mechanic regarding the\
  \ price for fixing the quad.\n\nMy mind was a mess from the proverbial flashbacks\
  \ of a childhood that I thought I had left far behind. A past I repressed because\
  \ it was easier that way. A culture that didn\u2019t easily meld with the identity\
  \ I had created for myself. An origin story that I couldn\u2019t fully run from,\
  \ but one that couldn't easily be embraced either. And yet, there is this yearning\
  \ for belonging because at the end of the day, wherever I go, I seem to remain a\
  \ foreigner.\n\nMy inner monologue was interrupted by Raja\u2019s hand on my shoulder.\
  \ The smile on his face made it feel as if everything was going to be fine. As if\
  \ it didn\u2019t matter what language I spoke or what blood ran through my veins.\
  \ As if it didn\u2019t matter which fields I ran through as a child or in what city\
  \ I found love as a man. In that moment I realised that it\u2019s not about having\
  \ a home or being a foreigner, it\u2019s about accepting who I am and the path that\
  \ led me to this roadside hut. I understood that every memory and experience I have\
  \ adds to who I am today. \n\nFeeling a sense of liberation, I embraced Raja as\
  \ if he were a long lost family member. \n\nRaja shook his head and said: \u201C\
  I just wanted to say that you can pay the mechanic now\u201D."
