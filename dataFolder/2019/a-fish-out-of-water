Text: "The Salton Sea 2019.\n\nAs the year came to an end, I became increasingly exposed\
  \ to shooting more landscapes than anything, which had already started planting\
  \ seeds of curiosity, as I had started wondering already, if I were a landscape\
  \ photographer, what vision would I pursue?\_As I had no idea, a frustration was\
  \ also creeping in.\_In a way, I felt\_like a fish out of his element.\n\nIt turned\
  \ out to be a perfect warm up, for as the new year started I\_\_had a trip planned\
  \ with Johnny Kerr, to this place he had been to before and had thought I would\
  \ enjoy photographing as well, the Salton Sea, CA.\n\nA 5 hr drive that we stretched\
  \ out with multiple stops along the way. Stops\_to photograph something that we\
  \ thought was interesting and\_the first stop is always hard, as we both start seeing\
  \ interesting things but there's an unfamiliarity still, cautious to take\_the first\
  \ step, to make it count, or some such thing.\n\nAnyways, the first stop you gotta\
  \ get out of the way as soon as you can, and get it out of your system to start\_\
  opening the possibilities. Even better if it flops like mine did, as it turned out\
  \ to be one of those things that looked better than what I could get out of it.\
  \ However it served its purpose as the following stops were called in a lighter\
  \ spirit, allowing the whimsical nature of seeing to guide us.\n\nThe Salton Sea\
  \ is a lake that is receding and has long been in neglect, the increasing salinity\
  \ of the water killing its fish. It was a surreal experience for sure, as this overall\
  \ grim phenomena, was contrasted by the photogenic beauty it was leaving in its\
  \ wake. The salt content staining things around it in different shades ranging from\
  \ ash white to salmon pink, passing through teal. The sand, if you could call it\
  \ sand, was mostly crushed fish bones, feet deep in some areas, in which your boot\
  \ would sink to ankle level and even at times uncover a smelly bough. The neglect\
  \ freckling the overall scene with some odd elements, previously\_submerged but\
  \ have since been exposed as the water recedes year after year.\_\n\nThe different\
  \ towns scattered across the lake, bare signs of a previous touristic boom, 1970ish\
  \ propaganda fading and peeling away with time. People still making a life out here...some\
  \ way. One spot in particular had even embraced the urban neglect\_visual aesthetic\
  \ and had decorated some landmarks with graffiti and some other props.\n\nComing\
  \ into this, both curious and frustrated, the crushed bones I stepped on were an\
  \ ominous reminder to what happens to fish who stay too long of\_water. We spent\
  \ most of our waking hours photographing the scenes, making stops along one side\
  \ of the coast one day, the other side the next day. I was exploring, trying to\
  \ find my voice within landscape photography, wondering if I had one, and came out\
  \ the other end unsure of it all.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the trip was great and\
  \ I look forward to repeating it again, I had a great time spending most of my waking\
  \ time taking pictures, spending time with my friend and fellow artist, and in a\
  \ way the trip affirmed experientially\_\"Yes, I can do this all day without breaking\
  \ a sweat\"\_so to speak. In order words, the experience echoed with something deep\
  \ within me, telling me I was meant for this.\n\nI'm still in the process of working\
  \ through these photos, and I'll probably leave some for later as I enjoy leaving\
  \ myself nice surprises (you're welcome future me), but in the meantime let me share\
  \ these two with you:\n\nI chose these because one of the things I guess I got out\
  \ of shooting landscapes, is that mood is important in this type of photography\
  \ or\_at least I find it is to me. The mood of the inner trip I took to the Salton\
  \ Sea, I feel is echoed on these landscapes.\n\n\nAndres Gonzalez"
