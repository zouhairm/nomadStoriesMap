Text: "\"Feel the positive vibes\u201D, intones my lithe Indian yoga instructor as\
  \ she demonstrates a series of graceful asanas. I try to concentrate but my gaze\
  \ is repeatedly drawn towards the studio window through which I can see the glacial\
  \ green waters of the Ganges gushing by. Last night from my balcony at the modest\
  \ Sanskriti Vedic Resort I\u2019d watched transfixed as the ritual Ganga Aarti took\
  \ place on the opposite bank. Hundreds of chanting faithful offered up little leaf\
  \ boats cradling ghee-fuelled lamps which the sacred river consumed in insatiable\
  \ swirling gulps. Now I too am in the thrall of Ma Ganga and the cosmic town of\
  \ Rishikesh.\n\nThe concierge introduces me to Aman, a flirtatious young Seik who\
  \ transports me on his scooter to my next digs at the Divine Ganga Cottages. This\
  \ secluded place has seen better days but affords even more magnificent views straight\
  \ up the guts of the Ganges to the lush Himalayan foothills beyond. I can literally\
  \ feel my vibrational frequency getting higher. \"Would you like to see my cafe?\u201D\
  \ Aman inquires once I\u2019m settled in, \u201DWe're opening in two days.\" \n\n\
  Located near the original Luxman Jula Temple, the cafe is not easily found up interconnecting\
  \ stair wells which open on to a building site with no back wall but the spectacle\
  \ of the Ganges snaking its way towards the subcontinent proper increases my vibes\
  \ dramatically. Aman grins; \"Welcome to the Shanti Shanti Cafe\". I set about helping\
  \ him sweep the floors and stuff pillows into fancy slips. During a break, I duck\
  \ next door to check out the competition at the Shambala Cafe. It\u2019s pretty\
  \ cool. Global travellers lounge around on cushions and a local MC riffs into a\
  \ microphone. A bearded Baba wearing only a loin cloth and a generous coating of\
  \ sandalwood balsam shimmies up beside me. With him is a jaded-looking Australian\
  \ woman. \u201CHow are you?\u201D I ask her. \u201CTrying to control my rage,\u201D\
  \ she replies. \n\nThe vibeometre drops a notch but picks up when a blonde Russian\
  \ waif wafts into the room. Ignoring the Aussie, she snuggles in between me and\
  \ the Baba and purrs into my ear; \u201CBaba has taken a vow to be silent for 12\
  \ years. He has six more to go.\u201D Fascinated by this footloose trio, I fall\
  \ into step with them over the coming days and visit some of their favourite haunts\
  \ including the glassed-in but super friendly Revive Cafe, the Ganga Beach Cafe,\
  \ and the popular Little Buddha Cafe. These are all places where you could happily\
  \ spend a few hours munching on chapatis while pondering the mysteries of the universe\
  \ but these three simply can\u2019t stop fighting. \n\nAt the cosy Freedom Cafe,\
  \ Baba jumps up and urges me to follow him down a narrow path to the Ganges where\
  \ he whips off his loincloth. Grabbing one of the chains attached to the handrail\
  \ he steps backwards into the whirling waters and dunks himself under, washing away\
  \ the crust of white balsam. People say the river is a writhing cesspit of foul\
  \ bacteria, others that it is miraculously pure due to ceaseless mass worship. Whatever\
  \ the case I\u2019m compelled to take the plunge too. It\u2019s definitely invigorating\
  \ and I don\u2019t stay in for long in case I collide with a cow carcass but drying\
  \ off in the sun I begin to feel strangely newborn.\n\nOpening night at the Shanti\
  \ Shanti Cafe arrives and the kooky trio and I take off our shoes at the door. \
  \ Aman ushers us to a low table. Carpet has been laid over the concrete and the\
  \ fireplace is ablaze. The atmosphere is delightful and I feel chuffed to have been\
  \ a small part of its creation. My chunky watch suddenly feels really heavy on my\
  \ wrist.  I take it off and give it to the Silent Baba. He can use it to count down\
  \ the hours until he can finally speak again. I no longer need my sneakers so I\
  \ leave them behind too.  As I walk barefoot back to my room, I turn to see the\
  \ trio arguing again. They will probably be stuck in this dynamic forever. But me,\
  \ I feel freer than I have ever been."
