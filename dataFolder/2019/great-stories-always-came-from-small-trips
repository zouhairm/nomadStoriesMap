Text: "The complex relationship between Israel and the sorrounded countries can also\
  \ be appreciate inside the israli population. Here you can find from really ortodox\
  \ people to catholics with an arabic ascendence. Arabs, catholics and jews feel\
  \ here as israelies, and is that common feeling, as isralies, what can make the\
  \ country united. This idea can also be gained travelling, visiting and living in\
  \ Israel.\n\nPortugal is not different, with a historical catholic tradition, now\
  \ leads the growing economy in the Iberia peninsula, which means that, probably\
  \ the shadow of Spain will soon dissapeare. The gap between both country can be\
  \ defined as the result of some of the worst politic meassures that both countries\
  \ have followed for centuries. The future of Portugal and Spain shall be linked\
  \ if both want to develop cultural and economically. \n\nI know, that as in my trip\
  \ to Israel, travelling there will bring me the opportunity of know the cultural\
  \ vagagge of Portugal and how it is linked to the cultural feautures os Spain (where\
  \ I came from). Also I feel really interested in seeing how the Brazilian clmunity\
  \ in Portugal adapts there. \n\nBut not only the cultural part, but the turism can\
  \ be also explote between both countries. I wpuld really to enjoy Portugal and see\
  \ the trip as a trip I would do inside my country, feeling like home. And who knows\
  \ maybe as romatic trip can happen. Can you imagine? And spanish Juliet with a Portuguese\
  \ Romeo? This should history."
