Text: "We had stopped. This was it, my home for three months.\n\nWe had driven for\
  \ one hour through the blistering heat of India\u2019s desert heartland and had\
  \ arrived in a small village. Kids playing in the streets, locals chatting over\
  \ cups of chai and farm animals grazing in front yards- it was an eruption of life\
  \ in the middle of miles of sand. \n\nI just needed to step down from the rusting\
  \ old jeep, and I would see the people who I had dreamt so much about. The people\
  \ who would house, feed and look after me. The people who would offer me my first\
  \ experience of India. The people that I had already planned, wished and longed\
  \ to call my family.\n\nI looked around at the expectant faces, my fellow travellers,\
  \ and said my quick goodbyes. I was going to miss them. They were my slice of home,\
  \ they shared my excitement and my worries, but they also had adventures of their\
  \ own they needed to continue with. I broke out of our sardine formation and clambered\
  \ out into new territory. My sandal clad feet hit the rich red earth, and the warmth\
  \ rippled up my body. Without any cover, the sun rays swept me up in their blistering\
  \ heat and my salwar kameez immediately stuck to my body.\n\nSmall dwellings surrounded\
  \ me, some made from crumbling red bricks, others from traditional mud clay, But\
  \ it was the one in front, with a small dark entrance, a long hanging roof and a\
  \ huge ancient tree by its side, that held my attention. Inside the little one story\
  \ construction contained the next 12 weeks of my life. It looked relatively new,\
  \ the bricks still proudly clean and the entrance well swept. From a distance, I\
  \ could hear the low murmur of voices inside. Hindi, of course. I wondered if I\
  \ would be able to learn any during my time hear. I hoped so. I was told out of\
  \ the family of five, there was only one daughter that could speak English. For\
  \ now, she would help me communicate. Her name was Shazia.\n\nThey hadn\u2019t heard\
  \ us arrive. Despite all my eagerness, I felt butterflies. Nerves. I hadn't expected\
  \ quite so many nerves. Calming my breath, I started up the path towards the house.\n\
  \nI was about 10 metres away from the entrance when a figure emerged from behind\
  \ the large tree to the left of the house. It was a petit girl, around 20 years\
  \ old, dressed in a green and pink salwar kameez and holding a bunch of clothes.\
  \ Her face broke into a smile as she made her towards me, pausing right in front\
  \ of me. Her eyes full of inquisitiveness, as I imagine mine were too.\n\n\u2018\
  Hi I\u2019m Shazia. You are Kate. I\u2019m so happy to meet you. Come, see my house,\
  \ meet my family.\u2019\n\nShe had already started walking, beckoning with her head\
  \ for me to follow her in. Well, that was lucky, I was happy I could now hide my\
  \ shockingly poor Hindi until a later date. I hastily followed after her with renewed\
  \ sense of confidence. Clutching my bag packed full of rich tea biscuits, welsh\
  \ cakes and Scottish shortbread, I ducked inside the house, really hoping that they\
  \ had a penchant for British taste. As I walked into the main room I was met with\
  \ a shadowy cool. About 2 metres by 6 metres, it was bare except for an old fan\
  \ propped on up on a stool and a simple elastic bed frame. And people. There were\
  \ three people sat down. A woman, around 50 years old, with deep laugh lines sat\
  \ near a door way, kneading a large ball of dough. A beautiful teenage girl, the\
  \ woman\u2019s daughter maybe, weaving lines of colourful material together. And\
  \ a young man, who was studious looking, working on a laptop. I felt foolish, I\
  \ didn\u2019t think there would be laptop. But why should I have though that? I\
  \ realised it was time I should forget my expectations.\n\nAs we entered they stood\
  \ up. And then, there we all were, taking each other in.\n\n\u2018Namaste\u2019\
  \ I said.  \n\nAnd with that our three months together began."
