Text: "India is a country which is full of surprises. I started my journey from Kolkata\
  \ ( the city of joy ). I had a great time in Kolkata. This city is also known as\
  \ Citi of palaces. I travelled to many palaces in Kolkata and among them my favourite\
  \ was victoria . Victoria was a palace which was build for queen Victoria when Kolkata\
  \ was the capital of india. This city is also famous for having the largest zoo\
  \ in all over India. There are some very famous temples in this city such as kalighat\
  \ temple, dakhineswar and tarapit for goddess kali. I had some very famous for sweets\
  \ specially a particular sweet named rosogolla and the very famous street food puchka\
  \ and jhalmuri in Kolkata. This city also had a famous bridge known as howrah bridge\
  \ with no pillar made by British. I also visited bada bazar which is the largest\
  \ spice market in south Asia. After I finished my tour at Kolkata I went to delhi.\
  \ Delhi is the capital of india and also known as citi of monuments. There are number\
  \ of monuments to visit in Delhi. The Taj Mahal is the most famous among them. It\
  \ is also among the the seven wonders of world. Other than Taj Mahal I also visited\
  \ the famous red fort and qutumb minar (a very famous tower just like Eiffel Tower\
  \ of Paris). I clicked a lot of pictures at every monuments. Then I tried Chole\
  \ bahture the most famous street food of delhi. Delhi is the heart of india and\
  \ it won my heart too. The next citi where I went after Delhi was Mumbai. Mumbai\
  \ known as the city of dreams , where millions of people come to fulfill their dreams.\
  \ Mumbai being the most populated citi of india is also known as the Citi that never\
  \ sleeps. I visited the beaches juhu chawpati and then the marine drive where I\
  \ sat for the whole evening watching the sun set and having paprichat ( a famous\
  \ street food in mumbai). It was very calm ,the only sound there was the waves on\
  \ the water clashing with the stones (all having a particular shape). I found a\
  \ peace in the air at marine drive so I cancelled all my plans of that day and stayed\
  \ there for quite a long time. The next morning I booked a car and visited the bungalows\
  \ of all famous Bollywood stars. Amitabh bachhan, sarukh Khan,  Salman Khan, hrithik\
  \ roshan , madhuri dixit, karena kapoor and rishi Kapoor . I even saw sarukh waving\
  \ his hands to all of his beloved fans standing in front of his bungalow. I also\
  \ visited some movie sets where I saw the making of some movies ,I also learned\
  \ some famous Bollywood dancing steps watching them. I enjoyed a lot. At last I\
  \ went to the famous hanging garden of Mumbai. It was an awesome view from the top\
  \ of the garden. One can see the whole citi standing there in the garden. It was\
  \ an enormous view and I didn't missed to capture it on my camera. Then I travelled\
  \ to the northern most part of india. Most of the places in the northern part are\
  \ hill stations covered with a layer of ice. I saw the himalaya range of mountains.\
  \ I saw the second largest mountain k2 also. The famous street food there was momo\
  \ and Maggie. I even took a bath under a waterfall at -8\xB0C  temperature. I participated\
  \ in various adventurous sports such as bungee jumping, river rafting and skiing.\
  \ And after completing my tour there I went to the some southern most cities. There\
  \ people are very familiar with English in comparison with other parts of india\
  \ , so I find it very easy to communicate with them. They were very kind hearted\
  \ and welcoming. The people there even offered me free food and a famous cloth known\
  \ as lungi. All the Males in south india wear lungi. They even taught me how to\
  \ wear a lungi. I had some famous south Indian dishes ( idly , dosa etc) . I visited\
  \ a very famous salt water lake (chilka). My journey was full of surprises that\
  \ is why I called it unbelievable india."
