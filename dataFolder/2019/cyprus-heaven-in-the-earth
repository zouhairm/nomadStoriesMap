Text: "This is about my experiences about a place called Cyprus.\n\tIt is almost 20\
  \ years back from now. I completed my graduation degree in Computer science engineering\
  \ in India and started applying for jobs. And I got a job offer in Cyprus. Ridiculously\
  \ I was not sure whether Cyprus is a country or it is the company where I was selected.\
  \ Anyway, I made up my mind to go to Cyprus. And to my surprise a lifetime experience\
  \ started from this thought.\n\tAs my travel date finalized I was getting excited\
  \ for an unknown place with many open questions in my mind. I was not familiar to\
  \ any popular Internet search Engines to search for this place either. But got some\
  \ reference from my company to get few things to pack needed to survive for this\
  \ Island. \t\n\tFinally the day has come. I travelled from Delhi India to Cyprus\
  \ via Bahrain. There was no direct flights to Cyprus from India. So it was a connecting\
  \ flight through the Middle East. \n\tLanded Cyprus on a hot afternoon in April\
  \ in Larnaca airport in Cyprus. It was a small airport with not many planes around.\
  \ After crossing Immigration I came outside of airport to take a taxi to my hotel\
  \ in Limassol (Limassol is around 100km from Larnaca airport). It was beautiful\
  \ sunny day outside. I could hear all Greek \u201CEla re gumbare\u201D , \u201C\
  Daxi re gumbare\u201D all smiling friendly greetings from the local Greek people.\
  \ It was so nice feeling that my nervousness of being on a totally new place got\
  \ reduced dramatically.\n\tAs we cruised in the taxi through the highway from Larnaca\
  \ to Limassol I could see and feel that we were passing hot, dry and not-so-crowded\
  \ areas of Cyprus. The music in the taxi playing in Greek was adding to the flavor\
  \ to my new experiences. \n\tI reached Limassol in the afternoon. The hotel I stayed\
  \ was near to the Sea. In fact there is hardly any place in this small place that\
  \ is far from the Sea. It was clear blue Mediterranean sea with clear Blue sand\
  \ everywhere you go in this place. \n\tIn the evening I enjoyed the Kebab in a local\
  \ restaurants with some nice red wine. This was a much needed after such a long\
  \ journey.\n\tIn next few days after I got a car, I travelled to nearby places in\
  \ Cyprus. I can say that being such a small island, Cyprus gives all flavors of\
  \ landscapes in the world. On one hand there is clear blue sea with white sands\
  \ in AiyaNapa , on the other hand there is old Greek villages of Lefkara with all\
  \ stone floors and on the mountain. There are snowboarding, skiing in Troodos mountains\
  \ and there are cool sunset in Mediterranean river in Paphos. I also got a chance\
  \ to visit the disputed area in north-Cyprus and visited the beautiful places of\
  \ Famagusta and Lefkara.\n\tCyprus is known as the place of Aphrodite, The Goddess\
  \ of love. Many couples, including old couples from around the world come here to\
  \ relax and enjoy the 365-days sunshine. Sitting on a beach restaurant with cool\
  \ breeze from sea and enjoying wine from a local village and have a relaxing time\
  \ is quite common scene across all cities in this country.\n\tTalking of food in\
  \ Cyprus I could see varieties of fruits in this country. There are strawberries,\
  \ Apples, grapes and many other fruits in the village areas of Cyprus. I was lucky\
  \ to stay near the orange trees and could see many orange trees with full of oranges.\
  \ And the tastes of the fruits are really good.\n \tAmidst many disputed area, Cyprus\
  \ is situated in the Mediterranean Sea having a cool, slow relaxed lifestyle. We\
  \ see a blend of Middle East food with belly dance as well as a lot of culture from\
  \ Soviet.\n\tAlthough I never imagined staying a long time in this small island,\
  \ but I stayed quite a long time here. And now after visiting so many countries\
  \ if there is one place where I would go and spend my last part of the life relaxed\
  \ that would be this place called Cyprus. Always in the memory and never forgettable."
