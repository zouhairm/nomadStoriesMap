Text: "Spain truly came alive at night. Just like her. She could never determine what\
  \ exactly about darkness animated her. Was it the constellations of neon lights\
  \ peering from the high-rises? The movement on the streets of people drinking and\
  \ laughing? The infectious music spilling from the crammed pubs that forced her\
  \ head to move to the beat? Whatever it was, she knew what she actually needed to\
  \ focus on was following Google Maps back to the hotel. She couldn\u2019t be late\
  \ for curfew. \n     What a shame. Five weeks into this program and she was never\
  \ able to convince her Spanish host family to let her leave at night. Wasn\u2019\
  t European culture supposed to be more open? You know, youngsters loitering, strangers\
  \ crossing paths, rendezvous with foreign men. At least, that\u2019s what Gracie\
  \ told her. \n\tGracie, her \u201Cmodern\u201D friend. Though were both from the\
  \ same forgotten Californian suburb hidden behind khaki hills, Gracie belonged to\
  \ the world. Gracie was one of those Indian girls whose modern parents spent their\
  \ adolescence studying in London and who had friends scattered all over the globe.\
  \ She was the type to spend her summers rotating around her cousins\u2019 homes\
  \ in some inconceivable foreign city, returning in August to recount unimaginable,\
  \ intriguing (and at times questionable) stories.\n     Perhaps crazy summers like\
  \ that were only meant for girls like Gracie. And other girls were destined to spend\
  \ June wandering into eccentric boutiques, having cappuccinos between classes, and\
  \ discovering themselves. Which was perfectly fine for Jasmine.\n     Jasmine. She\
  \ told others to call her that because it was less of a tongue twister for the Castilian\
  \ tongue than her Desi name, but in reality she thought to create a new identity\
  \ from scratch you needed to start with the very basics. When you spend sixteen\
  \ years regarded as some commonplace girl (that is if you\u2019re regarded at all),\
  \ why not spend a summer in a foreign country living as the idealized version of\
  \ yourself? \n     Jasmine spotted frizzy golden and silver curls outside glass\
  \ doors. Alba, the program coordinator was checking students in and assigning a\
  \ hotel room. As Alba\u2019s pen scanned for her name on the clipboard, Jasmine\u2019\
  s eyes wandered, fixating on perhaps the most out-of-place object in the street:\
  \ a stained mahogany door steps away from the polished hotel entrance. Was this\
  \ door always there?\n     \u201CJasmine,\u201D Alba tapped her shoulder and interrupted\
  \ her thoughts, \u201Cjust because you\u2019re spending the last few days with your\
  \ classmates in Barcelona, the program rules apply still. Curfew is 10:30. I want\
  \ you back at the hotel by then.\u201D \n     \u201CS\xED,\u201D Jasmine wasn\u2019\
  t listening, her eyes stuck to the door. \u201CAlba, what\u2019s that door over\
  \ there?\u201D\n     \u201CThat\u2019s the service exit.\u201D\n     \u201CThe service\
  \ exit?\u201D Jasmine tilted her head in confusion.\n     \u201CYes, the entrance\
  \ for the employees.\u201D Alba wasn\u2019t sure if Americans really didn\u2019\
  t know what service exits were or if her Andalusian accent was incomprehensible.\
  \ Regardless, she scratched Jasmine\u2019s name off and wished her good night. \n\
  \     Jasmine waited for Alyssa and Raven by the elevator, already hearing Raven\u2019\
  s Atlanta accent boom throughout the lobby, \u201CIt\u2019s really unfair we can\u2019\
  t go outside when everyone\u2019s waking up from the post-dinner naps and getting\
  \ ready to go out.\u201D\n     Marissa rolled her eyes, \u201CIt\u2019s policy.\
  \ We can\u2019t wander in the streets of a foreign country.\u201D\n     \u201CWhy\
  \ not? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to do anything. I just want to see a\
  \ sunrise on the beach or something,\u201D Raven cooled herself with a periwinkle\
  \ hand fan.\n     \u201CAt midnight?\u201D Marissa scoffed. \n     \u201CIt\u2019\
  s not even that far! We\u2019d walk out and take a taxi!\u201D\n     \u201CYeah,\
  \ let\u2019s walk out in front of the staff who\u2019ll report everything to Alba\
  \ and Margarita,\u201D Marissa\u2019s words were laced with irritation. All three\
  \ of them had all been lamenting that they\u2019d been unable to experience anything\
  \ not included in the school\u2019s program, but Marissa was fed up with obsessing\
  \ over it.\n     \u201CWait,\u201D Jasmine held her hand out. The girls hesitated.\
  \ Her face indicated that she was collecting her thoughts and constructing a plan,\
  \ \u201Cthe service exit.\u201D\n     Raven raised her eyebrows, \u201CThe service\
  \ exit?\u201D \n     The corners of Jasmine\u2019s mouth turned upward cunningly,\
  \ \u201CYeah, I know how we can sneak out tonight.\u201D"
