Text: "About 6 months ago, we started a daily flow while we travel that was supposed\
  \ to increase your personal happiness in 21 days. It was first suggested to us by\
  \ a friend (thanks Aerin!) and then our mom via a TED Talk by Shawn Achor.\n\nWe\
  \ tried it for 21 days at first and continued doing it periodically ever since.\n\
  \nThe five things you were supposed to do for 21 days are as follows:\n\n1. 3 Gratitudes\n\
  \n2. Journaling\n\n3. Exercise\n\n4. Meditation\n\n5. Random Acts of Kindness \n\
  \nWe will define each further, but keep in mind that each item is open to your own\
  \ interpretations.\n\nHere is how we did each of the five things over 21 days:\n\
  \n3 Gratitudes\u2014we wrote down three gratitudes on a notes app on our phones\
  \ when we first woke up. These gratitudes usually included people we valued and\
  \ why we were grateful for them.\n\nJournaling\u2014the gratitudes easily transitioned\
  \ into journaling about a positive memory we had the previous day.\n\nExercise\u2014\
  there is no requirement here other than moving your body to the way you feel. That\
  \ could be stretching, jogging, yoga. Your choice. We used a couple of different\
  \ workout apps (shout out to the Workout for Women app) to do 7-15 minute workouts\
  \ once or twice a day. It helps to understand that scientific research between doing\
  \ nothing and doing something is much more important than doing something and doing\
  \ a lot.\n\nMeditation\u2014always the hardest one for us, but using Calm, HeadSpace,\
  \ or our personal favorite, the Breathe app, helps to get even 5 minutes a day of\
  \ silent thought/meditation in.\n\nRandom Acts of Kindness\u2014this is the most\
  \ fun one for us! We often message friends a paragraph or two of reasons why we\
  \ love them or do random acts of kindness for strangers. Our gratitudes and journaling\
  \ often come into play here, because it reminds us of why we cherish someone.\n\n\
  After we enjoyed doing the 21 days program so much and saw the effect on us being\
  \ more easy going, chill, positive people, we thought: Why isn\u2019t there something\
  \ like this for couples!\n\nSo, we created a daily partner plan for those couples,\
  \ life partners, and husband-wife duos out there. Do this for 21 days to get closer\
  \ to your partner.\n\n1. Gratitudes for your partner\n\n2. Ask relationship questions\n\
  \n3. Physical touch moments\n\n4. Random act of kindness for your partner\n\n5.\
  \ Embrace before sleep\n\nLike before there is room for interpretation, but here\u2019\
  s how we intended each point:\n\nGratitudes for your partner\u2014you can journal\
  \ this first if you want, but tell your partner one thing you love about them daily.\n\
  \nAsk relationship questions\u2014find the right time do to this, but ask your partner\
  \ one question about your relationship. Some examples would be: What are you looking\
  \ forward to today? Is there anything I can do for you? How did you feel when this\
  \ happened? We especially like the morning ask of what your day looks like for busy\
  \ people, because it gives you a chance to set expectations and be proactive with\
  \ your communication.\n\nPhysical touch moments\u2014find time to massage, hug,\
  \ kiss, and make loving physical touches with each other at least once per day.\n\
  \nRandom act of kindness for your partner\u2014this can be as small as saying, \u201C\
  I Love You,\u201D in a different way than usual, or reading their love language\
  \ and doing something special for them.\n\nEmbrace before sleep\u2014wish each other\
  \ goodnight, give a kiss, end the day on a love note.\n\nWe hope these two plans\
  \ bring more happiness into your life. Try the personal or couples plans and let\
  \ us know how you feel after!"
