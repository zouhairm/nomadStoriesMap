Text: "She bared her teeth. Pure Pitbull. \nShe wasn't like the ones in the suburbs\
  \ back home, with collars and leads, well-trained. \nShe was raw, a street dog.\
  \ \n\nPraia do Forte, or 'beach of the strong', was a  local hotspot which, frustratingly\
  \ for the locals, had recently become a thriving tourist hotspot. \nI arrived by\
  \ bus, grateful for the air-conditioning which intermittently groaned into action\
  \ as we bounced along the \"highway\". \nDust clouds rose as we pulled into the\
  \ carpark.\nFragrant trees framed an earthy walkway, and moments later nature transformed\
  \ into cobblestoned pavers. \n'Bem Vinda', a sign welcomed us to a luxurious beach-side\
  \ shopping village  overflowing with glamorous resortwear and cafes. \nShops soon\
  \ made way to coconut trees, and there it was - Praia do Forte. \nGlimmering in\
  \ the late morning sun, small waves nudging swimmers towards soft sparking sand.\n\
  \"Fresh coco!\" A man yelled. \nJust 4 brazilian real (NZ$1.80), I'd been drinking\
  \ fresh coconuts daily since arriving in Bahia. \nI loved watching the locals hack\
  \ the top off with practiced ease. They'd throw the coconut up in the air with one\
  \ hand, and as it landed in their palm the machete would whack against the thick\
  \ shell on top. Into the air again, rotating slightly, another whack. \n4 rotations\
  \ usually did the job, success marked by the satisfying cracking sound as the shell\
  \ finally gave way.\nI watched as a young man spun my coconut until fresh coco splashed\
  \ across his hand. He smiled, a huge toothy smile as I thanked him, \"Obrigada\"\
  . \n\nBeach vendors walked along in front of sunkissed tourists and locals, offering\
  \ everything from hot cheese on a stick to sunglasses for sale. My Brazilian friend\
  \ had stopped me from ordering cheese on a stick, or \"queijo coalho\" last time.\
  \ \"They reuse the sticks\", she'd told me. Shocked, I'd listened as she told me\
  \ about the real Brazil. Crime was rife, and money was scarce. They did what they\
  \ had to, and sometimes it meant that kids as young as 6 would be encouraged to\
  \ commit petty theft or worse. Her nephew had been rescued from a favela after being\
  \ accidentally shot during a gang war. I had a new appreciation for food and money\
  \ after that. I never told my friend but I kept buying the cheese on a stick after\
  \ that story. I'd never eat it, but I'd buy it. \n\nThe Bahian sun was fierce, and\
  \ my pale kiwi  skin could only take a couple of hours before I'd start to go pink.\
  \ \nI left the beach in search of shade, and found a beautiful park just past the\
  \ swimming bay. \n\nI spread my towel down and lay back under the shade of a palm\
  \ tree. \nAnd seconds later there she was. A stunning, ferocious Pitbull. \nI had\
  \ grown up on farms, surrounded by dogs with wagging tails. This one had no lead,\
  \ one and a half ears, and a makeshift bandana collar. \n\nShe stepped closer...\
  \ not wagging, not barking, just watching. With her teeth. \nI waited, breathing\
  \ heavily.\nShe didn't move. I thought, searching my memory bank for something that\
  \ could help me. \nCheese. I had bought a queijo coalho from one of the beach vendors,\
  \ and it was still wrapped in foil in my beach bag - I hadn't wanted him to know\
  \ I wouldn't eat it.\nI slowly reached into my bag as she stared at me intently.\
  \ As I pulled out the foil wrapper, her gaze moved to my hands. \nHer tail moved,\
  \ an almost imperceptible wag. She took one step closer. I unwrapped it and taking\
  \ a square of cheese from the stick, placed it in my palm as I extended my arm towards\
  \ her. \nShe stepped forward, looking at me, then the cheese, then me, then back\
  \ at the cheese. \nShe quickly launched towards the cheese and it was gone in a\
  \ second. She wagged her tail and looked expectantly at the foil. \nNo more teeth.\
  \ Lots of drool. \nI palm-fed her the rest of the cheese cubes and we somehow bonded.\n\
  In my 5 months in Brazil, she was the only local I ever met who had everything she\
  \ needed."
