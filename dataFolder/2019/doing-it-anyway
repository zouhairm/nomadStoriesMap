Text: "Doing It Anyway\n\n\u201CAren\u2019t you afraid?\u201D\nThis is the single\
  \ most common question I receive when I share my stories of solo traveling. As a\
  \ woman, and one of a certain age, I absolutely can answer that question with a\
  \ resounding, \u201CYes!\u201D\n\nI am afraid. I am afraid that there isn\u2019\
  t enough time left for all I want to experience and discover and explore.  I am\
  \ afraid that if I don\u2019t leave now, leave this gorgeous apartment I have hidden\
  \ in, leave this meaningful job that has been my security and identity for 30 years,\
  \ leave my beloved dog with my grown child, I will cease to grow. I will become\
  \ complacent. I am afraid of those things. I must give up what makes me safe to\
  \ find what brings me joy again. I must go. Again.\n\nI used to be afraid that I\
  \ was a bad mom. I left my kids sometimes with their father to go on trips by myself.\
  \ I used to be afraid I was selfish.  But now the kids live in four different time\
  \ zones, confident because they learned from my adventures, daughters who were not\
  \ afraid to backpack on their own through Europe and Asia, not afraid to au pair\
  \ in Spain or study in Scotland, or spend two weeks traveling with Mom and seeing\
  \ Benedict Cumberbatch live in Hamlet.\n\nWhat I am not afraid of is being a woman\
  \ traveling on her own, as so many other women like myself are discovering. Our\
  \ children are grown, our responsibilities diminished and the world awaits us. I\
  \ am not afraid of asking for help from strangers when these 58-year-old bones can\u2019\
  t quite lug the backpack up the tube stairs.  I am not afraid of asking the bartender\
  \ for a local recommendation, or walking through forests and glens, museums and\
  \ boulevards, full of wonder, watching and listening and eating and drinking. I\
  \ am not afraid of building the campfire like my Dad taught me nor laying in the\
  \ tent with the stars so bright above and solitude all around.\n\nI am not afraid\
  \ because standing in the tower on Glastonbury Tor as the sun set, light filling\
  \ the archway and spilling like living gold onto my face, as the mist eased its\
  \ way around the hill making it an island, looking into the west towards Wales and\
  \ the sea, I felt that whenever my death comes for me, I will have this transcendent\
  \ image in my heart and mind, stepping over the threshold into the light.\n\nI am\
  \ not afraid because in Faery Glen on the Black Isle in the highlands of Scotland,\
  \ I felt the ley lines of my own life and how all things had brought me to this\
  \ moment, how all things were connected. I am not afraid because looking over the\
  \ valley on the trail near the Fall State Falls in Tennessee, the river so far beneath\
  \ winding through the wooded mountains, I could feel time become irrelevant, history\
  \ flowing, nature thriving, stress releasing, perspective shifting. The world is\
  \ so beautiful and in nature there are all the lessons and realities and dreams\
  \ I need to find peace.\n\nAnd I am not afraid of the humans I meet along the way.\
  \ Danger exists anywhere and delight is worth the risk. I do like to think it was\
  \ not fear, but healthy respect, the time I pretty much ran from the very obviously\
  \ haunted antebellum home I was supposed to stay in, or when I left the pool I was\
  \ swimming in at the bottom of the falls before the dusk became feeding time for\
  \ bears and cougars. \n\nDriving across America several times on my own, as well\
  \ as my travels throughout Europe, has taught me I am not nearly as much as I can\
  \ become by interacting with other cultures, observing the natural beauty of earth\u2019\
  s geography, seeing the historical and architectural and artistic wonders of humanity.\
  \ I am enriched not because of what I have or what I\u2019ve kept but because of\
  \ what I have felt when I traveled. Unafraid, expanded, blessed, awed, overwhelmed,\
  \ astounded, wild, free, and entirely me.\n\nAm I afraid?\nYes. And no. Who cares.\
  \ Let\u2019s go."
