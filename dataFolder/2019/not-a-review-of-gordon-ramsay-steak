Text: "Illusions are inherently deceitful and yet we are drawn towards them in their\
  \ many forms. Las Vegas is perhaps the centre of mainstream American culture and\
  \ it is a city of illusions. Take for example, the well known fact that there are\
  \ no clocks and no windows in the many casinos of Vegas. This inability to sense\
  \ the passage of time leads to the illusion that you haven\u2019t been gambling\
  \ for as long as you really have, and thus you spend more money. Gambling too is\
  \ an illusion, this time an illusion of profit. You just won 40 dollars but you\
  \ lost 100 dollars getting there. And of course, there are the magicians who permeate\
  \ the city\u2019s entertainment offerings. Yes I saw Criss Angel, yes he \u2018\
  freaked\u2019 my mind, and yes I was taken off guard by his sudden apparition next\
  \ to me, an event that was somehow both expected and shocking. After Criss suddenly\
  \ appeared, I went in for the high five as he went in for the fist bump, resulting\
  \ in his fist colliding with my wall-like hand, making an already strange moment\
  \ stranger. I would be remiss to not mention the strip clubs and legal brothels,\
  \ businesses whose trade is to provide lust-driven illusionary forms of romantic\
  \ contact. Even the location of Vegas itself is an illusion, an illusion that the\
  \ desert is a viable terrain to inhabit. And again, all of these illusions are driven\
  \ by profit.\n\tI went to Las Vegas for the cuisine. In the past few years, Vegas\
  \ has become a culinary destination for \u2018foodies.\u2019 Vegas has become a\
  \ renowned culinary destination as it offers talented chefs a venue to make a name\
  \ for themselves without the stress and low wages that define more conventional\
  \ culinary cities like New York. Vegas\u2019 emphasis on the culinary arts is an\
  \ aspect of what is known as the \u2018New Vegas,\u2019 the fluctuating aspects\
  \ of the city that reflect the changing demographics and interests of the millennial\
  \ generation of tourists. But in this city of profit-driven illusions, can the culinary\
  \ arts be made illusionary? \n\tTake for example, Gordon Ramsay Steak, a restaurant\
  \ name whose lack of a possessive apostrophe infuriates me, which is located in\
  \ the Paris Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, wherein I had a dining experience that both\
  \ delighted and disappointed me\nBefore being seated, I passed by what was presumably\
  \ a plastic display of steaks, with various cuts of beef arranged discretely on\
  \ an ornate structure resembling the flailed arms of an octopus. Impressive, but\
  \ perplexing. When I took my seat, I was able to take in my surroundings. The dining\
  \ room had a classy vibe, with suede and leather materials abundantly adorning the\
  \ room. Of course the classiness of the setting is juxtaposed and undercut by the\
  \ shorts-and-tank-top-wearing tourists who sit throughout the room. The walls of\
  \ the dining room feature numerous large framed portraits. The portraits are of\
  \ Gordon Ramsay himself, wearing the stereotypical white chef outfit, lounging around\
  \ and scowling on couches. I am nearly 100% certain that these portraits are Hell\u2019\
  s Kitchen promotional photos, probably circa 2005, meant to give the impression\
  \ of a bad boy image. Yet, the way that they are clearly staged and seemingly hung\
  \ in this restaurant without a hint of irony renders the images comical in their\
  \ strange lack of self-awareness. Furthermore, the soundtrack of this restaurant\
  \ is equally perplexing. \u201CThat\u2019s Not My Name\u201D by the Ting-Tings and\
  \ other pop hits of 2008 play on the overhead system. Surely Gordon Ramsay, the\
  \ bad boy chef who likes to scowl on couches, does not listen to this type of music.\n\
  \tOn my way out of the restaurant, I passed by the ornate meat cart once again.\
  \ I paused for a moment, waited till the employees weren\u2019t looking and then\
  \ quickly reached out and kneaded the tomahawk steak. Shockingly, it was real. Amongst\
  \ all these illusions, there is something real here after all."
