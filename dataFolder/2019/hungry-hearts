Text: "I don\u2019t know him, I\u2019m sure. Almost every morning I miss the first\
  \ train at Gracia but even while I wait for the next one, I\u2019ve never noticed\
  \ him here, on a platform full of people and their bulky dreams. Today I decide\
  \ not to catch it on purpose, even if its doors open exactly in front of me; I turn\
  \ around and I finally see him, playing an old melody on his guitar and singing\
  \ his story. Today I stay here, in front of his peacefully-closed eyes, and I listen;\
  \ in the middle of this crowded, frenetic and anxious time, I stop to discover more\
  \ of myself through his melancholic voice.\n\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have to, it\u2019\
  s enough you stayed and listen to my music\u201D, he tells me while I am trying\
  \ to leave a coin in his case. Don\u2019t feel ashamed, I am a busker too, I know\
  \ what it means, I think. I tell him eventually, and I see a smile hiding in his\
  \ cheeks and creating little dimples, right next to his lips.  \n\u201CI\u2019m\
  \ Rafa, encantado. Wanna play something? I bet you\u2019re good. You must be \u2013\
  \ for the record, I hear you singing on the platform every morning\u201D he said\
  \ in a laugh. I suddenly feel violated: how dare he spy on my life from a corner\
  \ of the station? How come our eyes have never met before, not even when I was zigzagging\
  \ among all the people leaving Barcelona every morning? Why have I never payed attention\
  \ to the people who live here with me, in this magical yet tremendous city that\
  \ is pumping blood into our young and reckless veins?\n\nYou tell me, Rafa. Blue\
  \ eyes and an old painted guitar to collect all the beauty of this place with its\
  \ colors, fears and struggles. I feel a tear is about to roll down my cheek and\
  \ I know exactly what to do: I hold my breath for 7 seconds so it magically goes\
  \ right back in \u2013 as my sister taught me when I was 8 years old. Since then,\
  \ I\u2019ve always tried to keep it all in, covered, hidden in safe and unusual\
  \ place like the bottom of my stomach, free of all the complications my heart can\
  \ cause. But he seems someone I can trust, so I let it out for once and wet my face\
  \ a little \u2013 I finally feel the hunger again. \n\nWhen we get out of the station,\
  \ it has gotten dark and I can hear the traffic in Passeig the Gracia. \nI smile\
  \ while I walk to the other side; it might be uncommon but the place I love the\
  \ most is right there, in the middle of the biggest avenue I have ever crossed in\
  \ my life. Not Park Guell, the inside of Sagrada Familia or Barceloneta, but there,\
  \ feeling the ground under my worn-out shoes, right then. \nLooking around and embracing\
  \ what has already been my home for 3 months, walking with a stranger with good\
  \ eyes and a guitar as backpack. I wonder how many stories we lose, embedded in\
  \ rail tracks we will never have the chance to slide on; how many looks we forget\
  \ to notice, just because we are busy running away from our lives.\nI\u2019m almost\
  \ on the other side. Rafa is smiling, probably asking himself why I\u2019m taking\
  \ so long to cross the road. I smile back at him, realizing how lucky I am to live\
  \ this story, and I start singing."
