Text: "Spending few days with a completely Antwerpian friend, I can confirm that is\
  \ \u201CThe city of pride\u201D in a good way of speaking. You can see it in the\
  \ way they walk, they talk and the most important, in their way of being. But wait\
  \ I am going in another direction. And yet this is a nice panorama of Antwerp, through\
  \ a native\u2019s eyes anyway.\n\nWe cannot lie, staying in a hostel is a very pleasant\
  \ and a very attractive way to meet new people. But this tale is too way far for\
  \ a normal stay in a hostel in this distinguished European city and it came from\
  \ the indoors of this magical hostel. \n\nAn important fact is that I was working\
  \ as a volunteer in exchange for food and accommodation that helped me find this\
  \ experience extremely interesting. I could see through guests and owners perspectives.\
  \ \n\nAs a traveler you may find it quite cozy, the reception was the same table\
  \ were we shared dinner time, all together, highlighting this because we were at\
  \ least 12 people dinning every evening at that table, situation that made me feel\
  \ like home. There I tend to meet fascinating people, one of them was the owner\
  \ of this place. Who heritage the spot I am referring to. Big enough to host at\
  \ least 100 guests. \n\nA significant matter that probably you won\u2019t believe\
  \ me and I am about to tell you is the precious and valuable background of the previous\
  \ information. The legend of the place says that the owner began from scratches,\
  \ renting one bed until the voice spread and lot of homeless came to stay, and then\
  \ it became more \u201Cdescent\u201D for other travelers like bagpackers the most\
  \ common customers by the moment. It was difficult for me to understand how this\
  \ business kept on going with its limitations until I found that the owner\u2019\
  s bloodline came directly from Anthony van Dyck, one of the most representative\
  \ painters in Antwerp after Rubens. Then everything start to fall into place. \n\
  The man that I get to know reflected a sad look, as his form of living. I could\
  \ almost perceive his homeless heart toward his behavior and the style of treating\
  \ people. \n\nDuring my agreeable nightshift I observe and listen too many things\
  \ about this peculiar place and excentric man. \nOn the living room wall you can\
  \ find this words that particularly represents him in all of its forms \u201CIt\
  \ takes hands to build a house, but only hearts can build a home\u201D. People from\
  \ every part of the world came to stay in this hostel for a couple of days, for\
  \ vacations most of them. However the mystery that involves this place is the long-term\
  \ stays. Expats or locals searching for the opportunity that can change their lives,\
  \ inconveniently for others trying to find ourselves, all for a better life. Some\
  \ lived in the hostel since the beginning. For this individuals it turned into their\
  \ homes. A possibility for being the cheapest hostel in the city. \n\nAntwerp can\
  \ shows the fashion life, arts in its highest expression in contrast of these people\
  \ that had to experience another culture to make a difference in their own.  And\
  \ this Guy has provide them a piece of tranquility while they figure it out. \n\n\
  A friend of mine said we were \u201Clost in the right place\u201D referring to our\
  \ magical encounter in Antwerp. I cannot agree more. I shared many coffees, beers\
  \ and full nights with outsiders expressing their delightful and enlightening feelings\
  \ towards hosting there. Even though, I truly noticed that they weren\u2019t happy\
  \ at all, not because of the place but of their own situation. \nWith their natural\
  \ routines I ask myself why after all of these years they are still living here.\
  \ \nWhen speaking with them reveals all the mystery. -The place have something that\
  \ makes you stay more- they said, - you can lose sense of time-. Nothing more true.\
  \ I find the loop within this place.\n\nNow all that comes to my mind are moments,\
  \ meals, laughs, tears, love, and specially perspectives of life that we bring together.\
  \ At the end of my journey I gain more than just friends."
