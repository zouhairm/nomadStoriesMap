Text: "The trip to the moon can seem so easy when you sleep at night. The thing was\
  \ that she wanted to go there for real. How did it happen? Why did she want to go\
  \ there? Who did she want to see there?\nBefore answering those questions let's\
  \ hear a bit about her childhood. Like many kids, she - her name was Emi - didn\u2019\
  t take No for an answer.  And you my readers, do you remember how you took No when\
  \ you were tiny girls?\nWhen she was around three, her mom bought her a rubber duck.\
  \ It was Donald Duck. Finally, Emi was all alone in the room but the duck seemed\
  \ to be so high on the shelf. Emi could barely touch the edge of the dinner table\
  \ when she put her hand up. The shelf looked as if it was an enormous mount. She\
  \ joined all her forces and pushed the step stool towards the bookshelf. From her\
  \ first days of life she had loved challenges. Somehow she climbed up and grabbed\
  \ the duck. She was so pleased with her achievement.\nThis was just a  brief start\
  \ about Emi.\nOne day she heard about the Moon though she was  too little to understand\
  \ what the Moon was. But since that day she watched it every night. She thought\
  \ \u201CHow come she is so changeable and I am always the same: tiny with a chubby\
  \ nose and a squeaky voice. I wish I could be as beautiful as she is one day and\
  \ touch her smooth and icy surface. Maybe this will make me as beautiful as the\
  \ moon is.\u201D\nMany times she imagined herself on the Moon. Whenever she imagined\
  \ herself there, she felt so protected and strong that she decided to find the way\
  \ to the Moon. One day she chose a city which was full of lights and high buildings.\
  \ When she finally arrived to this place it looked a little scary, as everything\
  \ seemed just enormous. She walked all around it. The city seemed to be enchanted\
  \ as the lights popped up here and there. Then she came across a very high  building.\
  \ Like she always did she went straight to the skyscraper and in a second started\
  \ to climb up. It felt amazing. As she took each step up she felt closer to her\
  \ dream - to reach the moon. Suddenly, it became cold and windy. Snow started to\
  \ cover her eyes but it didn't stop her from climbing up. She was very determined\
  \ in what she wanted. The  higher she went up, the more the Earth looked like a\
  \ little green pea. She turned her head down and saw all those magic lights twinkling\
  \ at her and cheering her up. She was happy, as she knew it was the right way to\
  \ the moon. It looked as if the building would never end. Finally, she reached the\
  \ roof. She stepped on it and couldn't believe her eyes. The moon was smiling at\
  \ her and looked very pretty. \n\u201CHello my dear friend. How is it going down\
  \ there on the Earth?\u201D asked the Moon.\n\u201CPretty well. We have fun sometimes.\u201D\
  \ answered the girl. \n\u201CDo you want to stay with me? It was a long way to reach\
  \ this roof.\u201D mentioned the Moon. \n\u201COh I am not sure now. I was always\
  \ fascinated by your beauty. I wanted to look like you. Now I see that you are really\
  \ stunning. However, I already miss my parents a lot.\u201D sobbed Emi.\n\u201C\
  Oh I see. Don\xB4t you worry my darling. All little girls should be with their mums\
  \ and dads.\u201D said the Moon.\n\u201CYou are right. It's time to get back to\
  \ Earth.\u201D replied Emi.\n\u201CIt was very nice to meet you my dear,  and be\
  \ sure that one day you will be as beautiful as the moon.\u201D exclaimed the Moon.\n\
  Emi watched for the last time at the shiny moon, smiled and started her way back\
  \ home. Now she knew that the Moon would always be there and it was enough to just\
  \ know that, but live on the Earth with her mum and dad."
