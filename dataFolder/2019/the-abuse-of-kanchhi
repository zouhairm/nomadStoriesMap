Text: "Dai. I tasted the Nepali word on my tongue.\n\nThere are few words so simple,\
  \ yet so powerful. \"Dai,\" I called again. \"Big brother.\"\n\nThe man who'd been\
  \ trying to play with my hair just moments prior pulled back sharply. He waved the\
  \ waiter over, \"One beer. And bring her a milk tea. She's my kanchhi.\" Littlest\
  \ sister. Perfect.\n\nI was in Nepal again. I came first as a tourist. Then again\
  \ for a lover, and now I was back a fourth time.\n\nThe job was simple, if physically\
  \ demanding\u200A: shoot and write about an ice climbing festival. Complications\u200A\
  , like an organizer's advances\u200A, were unwelcome.\n\nSo imagine my relief when\
  \ Santosh retreated to familial terms couched in a mutual understanding of sibling\
  \ responsibility. I was no longer an unattached, unaccounted-for woman who was open\
  \ game for his advances. I'd become his little sister.\n\nOver the next few days,\
  \ Santosh would beckoned me over. He was a visionary with Musk-like propensities\
  \ to drama. \"My kanchhi,\" he'd proudly introduce me, hand too-heavy on my shoulders.\
  \ A few inches from inappropriate. The others, in turn, would treat me with respect\u200A\
  : not as a tourist, but as a strange little sister who didn't speak much Nepali.\_\
  \n\nHis requests started small: could I help him word an email invitation to a press\
  \ meeting?\n\nThen it was, could I shoot the meeting? Could I send him a few photos?\
  \ I woke the next day to find my photos \u200Aplastered all over the Nepali news\
  \ and internet without photo credit.\n\nMy career may be fledgling, but I wasn't\
  \ running a charity. He apologized, and I let it slide.\n\nBut as we trekked to\
  \ the climbing area on the Annapurna Circuit, I'd dread hearing that word. Kanchhi.\
  \ It was inevitably followed by a request. Refusal meant a reprimand.\n\nI soon\
  \ learned: his job as dai was to \"take care\" of me; my job as kanchhi was obedience.\n\
  \nAt the climbing area, about 3500m above sea level, the altitude was no joke. Walking\
  \ to the toilet made me gasp for air.\n\nSmall requests became all the harder. Could\
  \ I do video interviews with each participant? They didn't want to leave the fire\
  \ either. Come, kanchhi, sit next to your dai. I was deep in conversation with the\
  \ videographer on how to split our work.\n\nWestern-me would have just walked away.\
  \ Kanchhi could not.\_\n\nAs kanchhi, I inhabited that ambiguous crevasse between\
  \ tourist and local. See, when you're a tourist or even a perennial visitor, you\
  \ can scratch up the surface, make a mess, and walk away. When you're there as often\
  \ as I was, with so many vested social ties at stake, that's no longer an option.\n\
  \nThe tipping point was on the long trail down from the mountains. We were breaking\
  \ trail through hip-deep snow. As we lifted each leg, the snow slid back in to cover\
  \ the void.\n\n\"Kanchhi! Kanchhi!\" I heard from somewhere down the line behind\
  \ me. We were walking close in single file to minimize the effort required to stomp\
  \ the snow down and drag our feet into the next caving step. I ignored his calls.\n\
  \nBut they were coming closer.\n\n\"Kanchhi!\" Santosh breathed from right behind\
  \ me. He'd stormed the line to give me his next instructions.\n\nI stepped off the\
  \ trail and waved the videographer past me.\n\n\"Kanchhi, take a video.\" I pointed\
  \ out, my camera was at the bottom of my pack to protect it from the snow. He'd\
  \ hired a videographer. And his iPhone X was perfectly up to the task.\n\nAs each\
  \ participant walked past me, my heart sank a little. It was hard enough to keep\
  \ up with all the strong Nepali mountain guides. Santosh wanted me at the end of\
  \ the line videoing the others leaving me behind. Then the toughest part: once i\
  \ repacked my camera, I'd have to walk faster than before to catch up with everyone\
  \ else.\n\n\"No,\" I said. \"Enough.\" I left him there in the snow, calling after\
  \ me and questioning my disobedience.\n\nHis voice picked up, asserting his power\
  \ and ego through volume. I ignored him and walked on, leaving kanchhi behind in\
  \ the deep snow on the mountains that day."
