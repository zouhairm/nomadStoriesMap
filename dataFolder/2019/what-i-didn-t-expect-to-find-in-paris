Text: "I was recently gifted a book which completely transformed my way of thinking,\
  \ and it happened to arrive at just the right time. \n\nThe book, although very\
  \ simple in principle, leaves one with a profound thought, \"what is the meaning\
  \ of my life?\". In the pursuit of my 'Ikigai' or my 'purpose'. I booked a solo\
  \ trip to France and hopped on a plane to Paris, where I would practice my newly\
  \ acquired romance language and eat ALL the pain au chocolat. \n\nI found, however,\
  \ more than just sweet p\xE2tisseries fran\xE7aises... \n\nOn arrival and armed\
  \ with an extensive checklist - itself as dazzling as the City of Light and Love\
  \ - I found myself utterly lost and alone amongst the burgeoning crowd. I had thought\
  \ that by saturating myself in \u2018La Ville Lumi\xE8re\u2019, I too would find\
  \ enlightenment in the heart-centre of France.\n\nInstead, I sat paralyzed for some\
  \ time in the petit confines of the city hotel I had checked into, staring at my\
  \ overly researched itinerary of things to do, not knowing where to even begin.\
  \ It was in that moment that I realized this journey would change me irrevocably.\
  \ It had to change me.\n\nIn the words of Anthony Bourdain, \u201CTravel isn\u2019\
  t always pretty. It isn\u2019t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks\
  \ your heart. But that\u2019s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you.\
  \ It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your\
  \ body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.\u201D\
  \n\nPeeling through the layers of panic that had unexpectedly swept across me, and\
  \ surrendering myself to the beauty of the unknown, I stepped out into the curtain\
  \ of night that had fallen around Paris and I have not since looked back. At least\
  \ not to who I was in that moment.\n\nTaking some time away from my day to day life\
  \ to gain perspective, and being totally brave and self-reliant in unknown territory,\
  \ helped me to discover my 'Ikigai' - a reason to jump out of bed each morning.\
  \ \n\nTravel opens the doorway to new experiences from which we can develop and\
  \ expand into something new, it breaks us open and transforms us into a shape that\
  \ doesn't quite fit back where it once did before.\n\nIn the end, what I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find was me."
