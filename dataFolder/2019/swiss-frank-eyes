Text: "Switzerland is a country of extreme beauty, full of natural and material abundance.\
  \ Going there for the first time, I was amazed to find three different nations living\
  \ as one. As you travel from Lugano to Interlaken to Geneva, you get in touch not\
  \ only with the Italian, but German and French heritage of this small yet, very\
  \ impressive country. It was the perfect place to meet different people, but what\
  \ happened was something else entirely. Even though the languages seemed to change\
  \ faster than you could finish a sentence and the buildings and living styles reflected\
  \ the craftsmanship and cultural diversity of locals who had once been foreigners\
  \ like myself, what was most striking was the insignificance of it all compared\
  \ to the immensity of nature. \n\nThe exuberant mountains, the transparent water\
  \ in the countless lakes and waterfalls spread across the curvaceous road connecting\
  \ one city to the next were breathtaking and awe-inspiring. Sitting there, in the\
  \ middle of the lake, amidst the mountains, one could almost feel they had been\
  \ carried back to a time when it was just wildlife. No human intervention, no grand\
  \ constructions, just the water, the wind, the earth and stillness. Profound stillness.\
  \ You can drive for miles without seeing a single person and, halfway, you can\u2019\
  t help but feel the urge to get on your feet and breathe the pure cold air that\
  \ surrounds this magical place.\n\nIf the road from one city to the next is filled\
  \ with riches, so are the towns. Built in a very minimalist fashion, the store windows\
  \ are a perfect display of opulence. Everything is very expensive, including food\
  \ and drinks, but what is most disconcerting is being confronted with the reality\
  \ that money can buy anything, Bugattis, Rolexes and even women. Men parade all\
  \ their acquisitions across the streets and sidewalks. Sometimes three or even five\
  \ women all dressed in black, hiding their faces. If people catch even a glimpse\
  \ of them, they might realize there are human beings under those covers.\n It is\
  \ so bewildering to be in a place such as this, where you can climb to the Top of\
  \ the World to see winter raging during summer, discover emerald lakes, woodlands,\
  \ cows grazing to the sound of their bells two feet away from the road; where humans\
  \ are scarce compared to the amount of trees and, suddenly, realize that the priceless\
  \ peacefulness is not priceless at all. This is a nation that is nearly intact from\
  \ the destruction of wars. It has been able to stay away from conflicts since its\
  \ rise as a Federal State. What has been neglected during all this time? Can freedom\
  \ really exist at the cost of others imprisonment? \n\nAs I watched those women\
  \ lift the tip of their veils to eat their lunch, confined to their separate tables,\
  \ and imagined how hot and claustrophobic they must be feeling, the connection I\
  \ made was to one of them. For the brief moment her brown gaze met mine, I wanted\
  \ her to know I related, I understood what it was like being a woman in a world\
  \ of men. Sadness filled her eyes and my soul as we both knew there was nothing\
  \ to be done. I got back to my lodge looking for answers and discovered that Interlaken\
  \ and its surroundings had become a haven to rich Muslims looking to vacation at\
  \ fancy Arabic speaking hotels, flooding the cities with millions of Swiss Francs\
  \ every summer. Islamic immigration had also grown fivefold in the last 30 years,\
  \ spreading the veil all over Switzerland. \n\nThe country is filled with the sound\
  \ of potent motors running and the glimmer of jewelry, but its birds sing louder,\
  \ its sky shines brighter and so does the hope that humanity will understand how\
  \ to live in complete and utter harmony with nature and existence; that tourists\
  \ will only experience and share love and acceptance wherever they go and that no\
  \ individual, nation or religion will put up with oppression and tyranny. I hope\
  \ to return to Switzerland soon, to find all women speaking their own language,\
  \ sharing their truth and enjoying everything this nation has to offer its people\
  \ and visitors."
