Text: "Here we were. Five hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle, yet sitting\
  \ in a climate of eighty-five degrees Celsius. But not for long though.\nAs we sat\
  \ in silence, we all stared out to the white, snowy landscape beyond us. All that\
  \ met the eye was a silvery haze. All except the vast, foreboding Arctic Ocean that\
  \ lay just a few kilometres away. It never really seemed to end, just fade away\
  \ until it somewhere met the sky. \nThe world\u2019s snowy reflection was the only\
  \ thing lighting the dark hut in which we sat. Our silence, however, had at some\
  \ point turned from one of pure awe to one of trepidation. The only thing to break\
  \ it was the occasional \u201Chiss\u201D of water being added to the hot stones,\
  \ usually with a wave of heat and a humbling aroma of Finnish wood shortly following.\n\
  \u201CLittle Finland\u201D was the nickname given to Bug\xF8ynes - the little Norwegian\
  \ fishing village in which we\u2019d found ourselves. Most of its 230 inhabitants\
  \ had descended from a few Finns that had fled the country in the 19th century to\
  \ escape the poverty. Despite the village being 90km away from Finland (or any other\
  \ type of civilisation for that matter), the villagers were still keen to embrace\
  \ their Finnish ancestry. And with such heritage, it was hardly a surprise that\
  \ saunas played an eminent part of their lives and culture. \n \u201CThere is a\
  \ sauna in every single home in this village. And in every single one of those homes,\
  \ the sauna is the soul of them.\u201D the owner of the one local bistro had told\
  \ us, just before serving us our freshly-caught fish soup. \u201CWhenever I\u2019\
  m in my home, and I can feel tensions arise between the members of my family. Or\
  \ with a colleague that I\u2019m not seeing eye to eye with. I tell them, \u2018\
  come, lets put this to rest.\u2019. And we both know to go to the sauna. That is\
  \ where all wars come to end. For there is something magical about that space, and\
  \ its ablity to reveal our true selves and feelings without us even realising. And\
  \ when one does leave the sauna, all conflicts and hostiles subside to nothing and\
  \ all is at peace again. We\u2019re too small and isolated of a community to have\
  \ tensions, we depend too much on each other for that. That\u2019s why saunas mean\
  \ so much to us \u2013 it keeps the peace, so we can keep living.\u201D\nAnd as\
  \ we too at the moment sat in the sauna, we all had a mutual understanding of each\
  \ other\u2019s feelings without having a need to discuss them.  \nI then realised\
  \ watching the bleak landscape, that it seemed a lot darker and greyer. It was one\
  \ o\u2019clock in the day, and our sunlight was already beginning to run out. If\
  \ we were going to go, we had to go now.\n\u201COkay, on the count of three, we\
  \ go.\u201D We all gave each other anxious nods of approval, all bracing ourselves.\n\
  \u201CThree. Two. One. Go!\u201D \nAnd with that, we all jumped up, scrambling as\
  \ fast as we could to the door, creating our own congestion through its narrow space.\
  \ And as I reach its other side, a blast of the Arctic air hit my bare skin and\
  \ shocked me through. Scared that I would become almost paralysed by it, I decided\
  \ to defy it and started running. We all did: across the meadow and down the steep\
  \ sides of the cliff with its harsh rocks scratching the skins of our feet. Stumbling\
  \ and full of adrenaline, we made it to the bottom, and started to sprint across\
  \ the beach to the edge of the water. We all looked to each other with smiles of\
  \ excitement mixed with apprehension. We all could see the water coming closer,\
  \ and closer.\nAnd then it hit us: the frigid cold of the Arctic Ocean and the pure\
  \ sense of euphoria that came with it."
