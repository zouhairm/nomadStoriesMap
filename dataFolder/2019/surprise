Text: "A gray day on Sunday, some deserted streets and cool air do not prevent Mrs.\
  \ Luciana from preparing her suitcase and going to Brasov for a planned trip three\
  \ months ago, from the desire to enjoy nature and to relax.\nAs he arrived at the\
  \ train station, he waited impatiently and carefully for the arrival of the train,\
  \ listening to the serious voice announcing each train, but as he headed for the\
  \ red booth to buy a magazine, the train heard and rushed to climb. He sat in compartment\
  \ 2, wagon 1 and was happy! Admire the modern-style buildings near the northern\
  \ station, typical of Bucharest, later enjoying plenty of terraces, parched and\
  \ painted with grass greens and yellow sunflower. The living table continues away\
  \ from the hills and high mountains, and Ms. Luciana is more and more delighted\
  \ until the end of the voyage when she hurried down to find the hotel.\nHe managed\
  \ to settle at Hotel Speranta and, for three hours, walked in the city of Bra\u015F\
  ov on the streets with bored and loud people. He did not know if there was anything\
  \ good to see if he found something interesting, but he decided to forget about\
  \ the notion of time and take advantage of the new environment. As he walked agilely,\
  \ looking at the showcases with expensive and elegant clothes, suddenly his right\
  \ foot slipped into a shoe-shaped hole, and he had the impression that something\
  \ was pulling her out. He scared and struggled to maintain his balance, pulling\
  \ his foot out, but a misunderstood force struggled against her. She was a prisoner,\
  \ and people seeing her, gathered as a show around her wanting to save her foot.\
  \ They succeeded after repeated efforts four men to kick her leg and, to her surprise,\
  \ the black ice of the leather she wore was replaced by a white bridal shoe. As\
  \ the foot reached the footpath, the hole closed hermetically as if nothing had\
  \ happened. Ms. Luciana saw that the shoe is a note that reads: \"Dear lady, I've\
  \ been waiting for you for a long time to go through this place, you're a treasure\
  \ for me and want to be my wife. The troubled woman did not understand what was\
  \ going on and thought she was dreaming. She walked on, shoeped with ice and shoe\
  \ for three hours, and tired, and returned to the hotel, where an adorable gentleman\
  \ in a frac shirt, a shirt and a bowtie, who had a large bunch of roses in hand\
  \ and second white bridal shoe. The woman realized that the shoe was similar, she\
  \ recognized it immediately.\n\nMr. Lawrence, a well-known landlady in Paris, asked\
  \ for marriage, and in a week they married just at the foot of the mountains, in\
  \ a puddle, next to a stream of crystalline water. Mrs. Luciana told her husband\
  \ about the street, and Mr. Lawrence told him it was him.\nThe couple has forgotten\
  \ about the accelerated time of everyday worries, the city's turmoil, the sadness\
  \ of the people he met on the street, and lived in harmony until he left for Paris,\
  \ a city where he enjoyed living. Mrs. Luciana was delighted with this experience,\
  \ because when she decided to go on a journey she did not expect to find anything\
  \ interesting and yet ..."
