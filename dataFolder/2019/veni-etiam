Text: "It is interesting the way life gives you the time you need, or that you think\
  \ you need. It has been a year prioritizing my writing over all the activities that\
  \ a person of my age \u201Cshould\u201D be doing. Parties, meetings, studies, courtships,\
  \ discovering life purposes\u2026 none of those catch my attention more than to\
  \ grant the words that float inside my head a sense on a paper.   \n\nAfter having\
  \ clarified this, I have to confess that I have not been very consistent lately.\
  \ Based on the premise that in order to write you need to have an experience, I\
  \ have been prioritizing meeting new people, and with them their ideas, in this\
  \ new city that is going to be my home for the next six months. \n\nI have been\
  \ practicing my English, French, and even my nonexistent Italian. I have been soaked\
  \ by rains that last all day, impoverishing myself by paying simple meals like delicacies\
  \ whilst enriching myself by listening to human beings that, having stayed in my\
  \ comfort zone, I would have never met. \n\nAfter some weeks, I have been trying\
  \ to recall my main reason for choosing this beautiful city that I thought (betrayed\
  \ by my mental relationship between the water and relaxation) was a city with the\
  \ appropriate peace for a writer. And I say I have tried because I have found it\
  \ almost impossible to find a moment without a new potential friend texting me to\
  \ go grab a coffee, pursuits of decent priced food, migration formalities to be\
  \ completed or, of course, school. Among distractions, responsibilities and the\
  \ fight for survival, a lot of ideas appeared and disappeared in my mind. \n\nBut\
  \ today, a day with excessive plans, life has given me the time. And I say life,\
  \ not to mention my lack of attention. And I say lack of attention not to mention\
  \ stupidity. And I could keep saying this until I find the acceptable adjective,\
  \ but I prefer to stay there.   \n\nAnyway, let me tell you that I am the only exchange\
  \ student that enrolled in a class that is delivered outside of the city where I\
  \ am staying. Why? Let\u2019s say that life put me there (or you can go back some\
  \ lines and discover the real reason\u2026). The other city is gorgeous, but it\
  \ takes me two hours to get there, which includes; half an hour of boarding a boat,\
  \ half an hour of wasting my shoes, 45 minutes on the train and 15 minutes checking\
  \ my phone in order to know which train or boat I need to take next. During my first\
  \ three trips towards my class, I had been totally concentrated during the journey,\
  \ with the intention of taking the correct exits at the right time.\n\nWell, dear\
  \ reader, on the fourth occasion you simply gain confidence. I must clarify that\
  \ in my country the trains, formally and for the moment, are just used to transport\
  \ materials, no visitors. Clarifying this, my evident acquired confidence and my\
  \ crazy desire to write, pushed me to pull out my computer and continue the story\
  \ in which I have been working on for the last few years. My fingers moved a mile\
  \ a minute, my brain at double this speed, and it seems like the train tripled this\
  \ speed because the stop I had thought so much about on the last three occasions\
  \ was not ahead of any more, it was behind. Ups.\n\nMy first thought, supported\
  \ by the threat that sounded over the train speakers, was the fine I would get if\
  \ they happened to request my ticket. Fortunately, after 20 minutes of trying to\
  \ stop the train with my head, the train stopped and nobody asked for my authorization\
  \ to be in that city. That city I had never heard about before, a city that after\
  \ searching on the internet I found has a very famous sports character and monuments\
  \ a little too flashy for tourism. This city that apparently does not have anything,\
  \ but that, after walking for hours, has given me a bench with the perfect calmness,\
  \ a story to tell and a moment that without any doubt is going to be part of my\
  \ memories."
