Text: "A two night trip with five international students to Cameroon highlands of\
  \ Malaysia. We waited in great anticipation. Nobody have ever travelled on their\
  \ own before. Like all young adults, Google was our best friend. After some ferocious\
  \ googling, the tickets and rooms were booked. From hiking in the forests, tea plantations\
  \ to almost missing the bus to return, it was an adventure.\n\n A five-hour stomach-churning\
  \ journey after and there we were It is a small town, with indigenous people. The\
  \ weather was what attracted me to the place. It was cool and misty, nothing like\
  \ I\u2019ve experienced before. Well rested and freshened up, we were on our way\
  \ to the night market. Held in a parking lot, it was a labyrinth with sections for\
  \ food, clothing, souvenirs and toys. While I was buying some flavoured tea, my\
  \ friend bought a plush wolf hat that he wore every night. \n\nAfter a great breakfast\
  \ with a big glass of warm masala tea, our trek began. First to the tea plantation\
  \ of Cameroon Highlands. The tender green leaves caressed by the bright morning\
  \ sunlight. Far away, it gave the impression of being in Tuscany, Italy. My friend\
  \ was having a photo shoot with a tea leaves picker's bag, while I was adding flavoured\
  \ tea to my already large collection. Butterflies flying around you, while you look\
  \ at other insects, some I didn\u2019t know the existed. We didn\u2019t last a minute\
  \ in the bee farm from fear of being stunk. Hiking through the mossy forest and\
  \ feeling the spongy sensation of the moss. After a long day of walking, our reward\
  \ was the infamous Clay pot soup. The thick liquid warmed our empty stomach. We\
  \ ended the night around a camp fire, playing truth or dare.\n\nThe last day, we\
  \ were all packing, trying to squeeze all the souvenirs and in my case, all the\
  \ teas, into our bags. A masala tea after, we boarded the bus. Midway on the road,\
  \ it parked on a gas station for the passengers to stretch their legs, eat something\
  \ and freshen up. A friend and I made our way to the lavatory and had to wait due\
  \ to the troops. We were the last to leave and had to run to catch the bus as the\
  \ latter was already moving. I took a scream from my friend to warn the driver to\
  \ stop. Back in the bus, everyone was staring at us as we were walking. \n\nBack\
  \ to our world and all the photos and videos taken shared, we parted ways. All preparing\
  \ for the coming semester."
