Text: It was an overall amazing experience arriving to Hawaii as my first ever holiday
  by plane. See I was always in fear of getting in a plane as its so high. But finally
  last january I made the big desicion to take the leap of faith & conquered my fear
  by getting in aer lingus plane to travel to one stop to San Fran & stayed their
  one night. My luggage didnt arrive their so went to buy essentials for staying overnight.
  Next morning got the hawaiian airlines to Hawaii. Such a fabulous destination. Waited
  for my luggage to arrive no sign of it a few purple luggages going through but none
  were mine so went to the desk & luckily a kind lady managed to come over with my
  luggage found. Got a bus shuttle to Coconut waikiki & saw the hotel was just as
  beatiful as it looked before I booked it. Had a balcony overlooking the palm trees,
  sun, high built apartments & sea. So happy to know this was my base for the time
  I will be spending here. Went out exploring the town, real fun place to go on strolls
  & enjoy the view. Asked the hotel staff the next day for a taxi & minutes later
  a Limo arrived & collected me & it was the same price you wouldve paid for a taxi
  which was great. Got dropped off to Honolulu Zoo. Had so much fun seeing all the
  animals & drinking pineapple juice. Went to Mike Tysons live show & afterwards got
  a meet & greet. Was really good as I didnt have backstage passes so was lovely when
  the production did allow it. Bought some face creams in tresor rare which was nice
  to take back from the holiday & got clothes etc. Thoroughly enjoyed the holiday
  & am dreaming of the day I can go back as I cant wait to explore again was definitely
  worth conquering my fear of planes for ha. I love being in planes & am excited for
  the next journey abroad.
