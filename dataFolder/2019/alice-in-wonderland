Text: "Paris; The city of light. Endless metro lines and stairs full of people from\
  \ faraway places who sang with their angelic voices. Their beautiful tunes making\
  \ their echoes inside my head without me realizing I was underground trying to reach\
  \ my destination. Making me travel for a while in the centre of my deepest thoughts,\
  \ just before I was about to reach the surface once again. And upon there the most\
  \ stunning sites waiting to be seen: Montmartre with its picturesque roads and quaint\
  \ shops with souvenirs. Artists making sketches of tourists and local people in\
  \ a matter of minutes, making me more enthusiastic than ever.\n\nThe Louvre museum\
  \ with its magnificent pyramid always reflecting the sun. Its inner space hosting\
  \ unique pieces of art from all around the world. I would need a lifetime just to\
  \ see all those legendary paintings and statues. So much talent, hard work and stories\
  \ being depicted just in front of my eyes. Like I had the power to travel through\
  \ time and feel what these artists felt like while creating this vivid image. If\
  \ there were not for the working hours I would probably still wander around this\
  \ place. \n\nThe Notre Dame, living in my dreams thanks to Quasimodo whom I loved\
  \ since I was little girl. Never imagined I would ever go there. Not just in Notre\
  \ Dame but in Paris in general. And now here I was. Living inside my childish dream.\
  \ Like Alice in Wonderland. The only difference is, I wasn\u2019t really dreaming.\
  \ I became the place and the place became me. Maybe for a second or maybe for the\
  \ whole trip. But it did all the same. And after that, just another cathedral who\
  \ stole my heart like no other; Sainte-Chapelle. It was more like a royal chapel\
  \ than a cathedral in fact. So small and yet so big. The moment I entered the second\
  \ floor I let out a whoop of excitement as it was all covered in stained glass windows.\
  \ I could literally live there. Never had I thought so much beauty could exist in\
  \ such a tiny place.\n\nFinally, the Eiffel Tower. So much more than just a tourist\
  \ attraction. So much more than just some tones of metal. A symbol. An idea. A way\
  \ for Gustave Eiffel to express himself as every one of us should do. Before this\
  \ trip I held the belief, it was only overestimated. I thought about it as a sweet\
  \ picture for the hopeless romantics. But I was wrong. It was a masterpiece. Nevertheless,\
  \ I must admit that when I reached the first floor I was scared to death. I am not\
  \ afraid of heights very often, but this glass floor made my worst nightmares come\
  \ to life.\n\n Despite that, I was determined to reach the top. I was in one of\
  \ the most famous cities in the whole world and nothing, not even myself, could\
  \ stop me from going all the way up there. So, I climbed and climbed the staircase,\
  \ exhausted as I was, trying my best not to look at the void under my feet. Hopefully,\
  \ after a while we arrived at the second floor in order to take the elevator. The\
  \ thing is, I had no idea its doors were transparent. I wanted to scream so badly\
  \ but all I did was to say \u201COh mommy\u201D in Greek. I did not recall this\
  \ word was international. More than ten Spanish people and some others whose nationality\
  \ could not distinguish, turned to look at me only for them to laugh with their\
  \ hearts. I just hope they could sympathize me even a bit. Whatever the case, they\
  \ somehow made me feel more secure.\n\nWhen we finally reached at the top the view\
  \ sent shivers down my spine. I was breathless. Words are not enough to describe\
  \ all that I was seeing. I was thrilled. I was touched. I was more alive than ever\
  \ before. I found myself up there, just 300 meters above the ground. Paris, I promise\
  \ I will never forget you. I wish you could somehow hear that. Poets and artists\
  \ were right about you, you are a gem. Until the next time."
