Text: "Paradise. No other word describes Pedros home better than these eight letters.\
  \ It was the swastika on his worn out clothes which, as a German, made me curious.\
  \ Pedro is a Guna, indigenous people of Panamas San Blas Islands. The swastika is\
  \ their symbol standing for the four sides of the world. This dichotomous icon connected\
  \ us.\nThis short old man was so amazed by my interest in his culture that he invited\
  \ me to accompany him, knowing that my plan was to get to Colombia from the port\
  \ where we have met. It took us about an hour to get to his island from the dirty,\
  \ stinky harbor on the mainland where he sold his freshly fished seafood. Yes, His\
  \ island. One of 365 in this Archipelago. The smallest islet yet big enough to be\
  \ home for a single palm tree making it perfect for the well known picture of a\
  \ cast away scenery, the biggest with a city of a couple of thousands residents.\
  \ On the way in his motorized nutshell, the fishing rod always there to get some\
  \ more fish, this time for our dinner, some dolphins came across. Pure nature and\
  \ me wondering weather this is actually happening or just dreaming.\nOn the island\
  \ I was presented to the nine members of Pedros family. The women all dressed up\
  \ in their colorful traditional clothes and loads of crafted ornaments, the men\
  \ in a modern way with jeans and polo shirt. Everybody a bit reserved looking at\
  \ me, the 6 feet 4 white and blond stranger their husband, father, grandfather and\
  \ uncle just brought to their home. The communication was a bit difficult as just\
  \ Pedro and his nephew Antonio spoke Spanish, which I dominate quite well. No English,\
  \ no German, just their own language and Spanish. But with my hands and feet and\
  \ the help of Antonio as translator I also tried to get along with all of the family.\
  \ A smile is also a good way to break the ice and straight enter hearts.\nThree\
  \ cabanas as the Guna sleep traditionally in hammocks in handcrafted bamboo huts,\
  \ a partition and a shady construction. It took me fifteen Minutes to slowly walk\
  \ around the whole isle and discover everything. Back at the covered area I asked\
  \ for the toilet. Antonio smiled at me and said: \u201Cchoose one of these\u201D\
  , pointing at the hundreds coconut palm trees. \u201Cbut make sure to dig a hole\
  \ first and cover it well after you have finished as nobody wants to step in it\
  \ afterwards.\u201D Lets say you get used to do it like this and leave you here\
  \ with further imaginations. What was I expecting when I agreed to come with Pedro\
  \ to his home? The desert island had no water pipe and no power. Things one is so\
  \ used to that you just realize it when it\xB4s missed out. It was hard for me in\
  \ the first two days but I learned from the others and appreciated the new gained\
  \ freedom more and more. \nSo what to do when there\xB4s \u201Cnothing\u201D but\
  \ sand and the Caribbean Sea? Relax, swim, snorkel with rays, turtles and dolphins,\
  \ go fishing with the men to have for eating and learn how to cut a coconut with\
  \ a machete. Life as simple as it could be and the best place to forget everything\
  \ you where worried about life.\nI was already six days having the time of my life\
  \ when a Spanish sailor anchored with his sail in the calm crystal clear water in\
  \ the bay of \u201Cmy\u201D isle. Chatting with him he offered to take me to Colombia\
  \ as he needed a hand for the three days passage anyway and I needed to continue\
  \ towards Southamerica. As I looked to Pedro he had a board grin on his face, knowing\
  \ this was going to happen when we met in first place at the port. He revealed that\
  \ he knew that the Spanish was about to step by as they become friends a long time\
  \ ago. \nAfter a last supper we set sail, me with mixed feelings letting my new\
  \ family and this paradise behind and awaiting new adventures to come."
