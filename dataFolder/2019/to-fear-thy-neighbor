Text: "Bridges, by nature, connect things, joining one side to the other. Mitrovi\xE7\
  a\u2019s \u2018New Bridge\u2019, however, is an infamous point of contention and\
  \ division, as it was formerly the battleground for ethnic hate in what has been\
  \ called Europe\u2019s most brutal sectarian conflict since World War II.\n\nTwenty\
  \ years after Kosovo\u2019s armed conflict\u2014in which the international community\
  \ intervened to stop ethnic cleansing\u2014and just over a decade since its self-declared\
  \ independence, the country\u2019s identity crisis is still materialized in the\
  \ unsettled faces of the Kosovar Serbians and Albanians in this intemperate town.\
  \ The gunfire has ceased and the embers have cooled, yet it seems everyone is afraid\
  \ of a misthrown match. \n\nTo date, most ethnic-Serbians stay on their side of\
  \ the river, and ethnic-Albanians on the other. \n\nThough Mitrovi\xE7a lies entirely\
  \ within Kosovo\u2019s borders, people on either side of the bridge are still using\
  \ different currencies, speaking different languages, and telling different stories\
  \ about how the country came to be. \n\nWith the typical clich\xE9s that \u2018\
  youth are the future\u2019 and \u2018progress takes generations\u2019 in mind, I\
  \ sought out young people\u2019s opinions in order to gauge whether or not ethnicity\
  \ still matters. I met Branki\xE7a, a twenty-three-year-old Kosovar-Serb, on campus\
  \ at the International Business College, and, at first, she had a lot of inspiring\
  \ things to say. She expressed, almost as if it was obvious, that young people aren\u2019\
  t constrained by impeding categorizations such as religious affiliation, ethnicity,\
  \ or race. Her tone told me that young people know better, even though they had\
  \ inherited this tension of violence. \n\nHer apartment sits on the edge of the\
  \ river and from her bedroom windowsill she has a panoramic view of the \u2018Albanian\u2019\
  \ side. She was shy to admit that she doesn\u2019t know the details about the inhumanity\
  \ of the war because she hates to ask questions that upset her mother. Tens of thousands\
  \ of people died. Family members disappeared. Friends were displaced. And because\
  \ of that, she was initially afraid when her family bought this apartment so close\
  \ to the bridge. \n\n\u201CI was thinking \u2018oh my god the Albanians, what will\
  \ they do to us\u2019, but since moving here I realize that we have the same problems,\u201D\
  \ she said. \u201CThis is a divided city, but they are free to come to the north\
  \ and we are free to go to the south and we don\u2019t have to be afraid. It\u2019\
  s all just prejudice.\u201D\n\nAfter talking for a while\u2014about our studies,\
  \ our dreams of travel, our favorite foods\u2014I asked if she could show me the\
  \ other side of the bridge. She agreed, and I didn\u2019t notice any hesitation.\
  \ \n\nTo cross, we first had to pass by a makeshift-wall made of malleable matte\
  \ metal. The stapled-together sheets stand at about 10 meters high but are only\
  \ a few centimeters thick, proving its purely aesthetic function. Branki\xE7a explained\
  \ that there used to be a much larger, concrete wall, but it was removed a few years\
  \ prior. Either she doesn\u2019t know why or chose not to tell me.\n\nThe icy snow\
  \ crunched and compacted beneath our feet, and it must have been the fear of slipping\
  \ that distracted her from what she was doing. We both pointed at the amateur graffiti\
  \ below--the word \u2018Albania\u2019 crossed out and \u2018Serbia\u2019 written\
  \ over it, and the word \u2018Serbia\u2019 crossed out with \u2018Albania\u2019\
  \ shouting back in capital letters. When the realization came that she that she\
  \ had fully crossed over the bridge and tread into Albanian territory, she panicked.\
  \ \n\nShe had never been there before, on the other side of the river, two minutes\
  \ from where she lived. \u201CI don\u2019t feel safe,\u201D she told me, \u201C\
  everyone is staring at me.\u201D She started breathing heavily. I didn\u2019t feel\
  \ anything or see threatening looks, but her distress sent her striding back over\
  \ the bridge. \n\nI apologized for making her uncomfortable, as our conversation\
  \ genuinely led me to believe that the tensions were being created by rumors, misunderstandings,\
  \ and pain from a distant past. She agreed but qualified that she was confident\
  \ Albanians would still hurt her.\n\nSo then, what is true? Is there still danger,\
  \ or is everyone afraid of their own socially-constructed biases to the extent that\
  \ they find safety in division and fear?"
