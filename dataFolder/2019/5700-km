Text: "Everyone has purpose for traveling. Some people travel for passion. Some people\
  \ travel for relief their stress. Some travel to forget their past. What is your\
  \ purpose of traveling ?. As on me, I went overseas as a blank paper. My heart was\
  \ so empty. I just can not forgive my self. Therefore I felt so lonely.\n\nIt was\
  \ 2016 when I met her for the first time. \u201Ckawai\u201D the word I used to describe\
  \ her. She is Japanese born. She has classic short hair, and the most beautiful\
  \ smile I had ever seen in the world. She sat beside me during a ceremony. \u201C\
  Harue\u201D is her name. It means spring season. What a beautiful name.\n\nStories\
  \ goes. We get to know each other. We had fun together. She told me many things\
  \ about her life, about her experience traveling. I still remember how she always\
  \ take a picture of small elephant doll called \u201CMerika\u201D. It might be something\
  \ from her past. She inspired me. I fell in love with her. Many things happened\
  \ since then. I don\u2019t remember exactly what was happened, but then I lost her.\
  \ I could not fix it before we finally separated by 5700 KM away, Jakarta to Tokyo.\n\
  \nI don\u2019t want this to be happened, but it did happened.It took sometimes for\
  \ me to move on. Many times I blame myself. I regret everything. I cannot forget\
  \ her.I felt so lonely, powerless and in pain. However, I have to learn forgiving\
  \ myself. Life must go on.  \n\nI decide to travel. My first stop was Malaysia.\
  \ In Malaysia I met my friend. He is an Indian. His ancestor came long time ago\
  \ to Malaysia, built colony there, mingle with fellow malayan citizen, before the\
  \ country called Malaysian. No need for long time until we become brothers. He made\
  \ me enjoy malaysian dishes, which is delicious with ample portion. He brought me\
  \ to visit petronas tower and \u201Cpusat oleh-oleh\u201D. Although central of Malaysia\
  \ is so hot, I felt warmth by his kindness. I felt not lonely anymore.\n\nOn the\
  \ next occasion I decide to visit Philippine. It is a coastal country. One of the\
  \ most beautiful place in the world. It has collection of beautiful beaches, churches\
  \ and islands. This time I accompanied with \u201CHullya\u201D. it is small elephant\
  \ doll, the same doll with Harue\u2019s. Well, it is not exactly the same. As I\
  \ said, she inspired me. \n\nThere is one country I really want to visit. The country\
  \ is Brunei Darussalam. It is monarch country. The country adapt Islam as law and\
  \ regulation for its citizen. I don\u2019t know why so many people has wrong perception\
  \ about Brunei. The same thing does to Islam. \n\nPeople of Brunei are interesting.\
  \ They are natural born wealthy. You will see in every house in Brunei, every member\
  \ of family has at least one car. So if there is Five family members in the house,\
  \ the house has at least 5 cars. What a rich country. I don\u2019t even have my\
  \ own car until now.\n\nOne thing so interesting happened to me. I came to Brunei\
  \ exactly at the same time with the visit of Prime minister of Singapore. It means\
  \ many events were being held in Brunei. My friend Zuudin helped me to mingle with\
  \ fellow Brunei and even with the royal family. Unexpectedly we managed to do meet\
  \ and greet with Sultan of Brunei. It is once in lifetime experience you could face\
  \ to face with Sultan of Brunei and having a picture so closely with him.\n\nMost\
  \ of Brunei citizen are warmth and so kind. I could tell you. When I visit my friend\
  \ house. He offered me plenty of food. So many kind of food at one table. We are\
  \ just three person, but the food were so plenty. Our stomach so full that day.\
  \ I am so grateful. Every time I meet new places, new experiences, new family and\
  \ new friends, I can feel Harue by my side. I wish she could here with me now. Harue\
  \ If you read this. I want to say  \"Aishiteru\"."
