Text: "On one of our first days in Central Java, we met Johnny. Johnny was our Grab\
  \ driver when we went to visit a prominent mosque, known for its modern architecture\
  \ and, of course, top floor, rotating restaurant. As it turns out, Johnny loves\
  \ Jesus.\n\nWe talked for a while about what it\u2019s like to be a Christian in\
  \ Indonesia. He said in Semarang, he\u2019s lucky. The Muslims here are very tolerant\
  \ of Christians; he can live his life and worship his God as he chooses. Other places\
  \ aren\u2019t so lucky, but, \u201Cpeople are really nice in Semarang.\u201D\n\n\
  \"Interesting,\" I thought. \n\nHe considers himself lucky that he is allowed to\
  \ be a Christian without any repercussions, because in many parts of his country,\
  \ Muslim people aren\u2019t tolerant of Christians. \n\nThroughout Indonesia, I\u2019\
  ve been told that Sharia Law is common, and you have to identify your religion on\
  \ your ID card, which can lead to discrimination and persecution. Some places, like\
  \ Semarang, allow many religions; up to six are accepted here. Some places don\u2019\
  t allow more than one or two.\n\nAs an American, I filtered that through my Western\
  \ brain: here, Islam dominates; Christians pray to be tolerated. \n\nHow crazy to\
  \ feel like my existence is simply permitted. I didn\u2019t like it. Immediately,\
  \ my heart was pulled to my sweet Muslim friends back in the United States, who\
  \ must feel \u201Ctolerated\u201D quite often.\n\nFor the remainder of that car\
  \ ride, my mind was swimming with the thought, \u201CI can\u2019t just be tolerant;\
  \ it\u2019s not enough anymore.\u201D I was racking my brain for ways to be intentional\
  \ and to BE love. I came to the conclusion that I must celebrate people, cultures,\
  \ novelties, and the fact that I get to share space with them. I have to love with\
  \ the knowledge that the God who said I am \u201Cfearfully and wonderfully made\u201D\
  \ wove everyone else together in that same way. \n\nMary Magdalene. The Samaritan\
  \ woman at the well. Zacchaeus the tax collector. All were people who the rest of\
  \ the world \u201Ctolerated.\u201D Jesus loved them intentionally and called out\
  \ the greatness within them.\n\nWhen we arrived at the mosque, we awkwardly stumbled\
  \ around, trying to figure out what to do with our shoes, which bathroom to use,\
  \ and whether to sit, stand, or bow low to the ground. \n\nWe were seven foreigners.\
  \ Seven Christian women. We look American and out of place. But every man, woman,\
  \ and child that we (sometimes literally) ran into smiled and welcomed us. Asked\
  \ us to pray with them. Showed us where to go. Allowed us to be tourists in their\
  \ place of worship. And forgave us when we did it all wrong. We were shown kindness\
  \ in a place we didn\u2019t belong, where our presence should have simply been...tolerated.\n\
  \nOn that sweltering, sticky morning, squished into a very compact sedan with 4\
  \ other girls, Johnny showed me, without even knowing it, that it was time for me\
  \ to become intolerant of tolerance and to love people on purpose. Simply because\
  \ they\u2019re people. Same as me."
