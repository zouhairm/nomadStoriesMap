Text: "The crisp air of North Carolina made me forget I was finally travelling to\
  \ NYC!  The city that never sleeps and I had been sleeping mighty well in the mountains\
  \ of Hendersonville. \nI fly into LaGuardia... Not exactly the airport you see in\
  \ the movies.  Jump on a shuttle bus to check into my hostel.  I'm walking up the\
  \ stairs..  Pig tails back pack,  that Aussie smile and they tell me they have overbooked.\
  \  The next thing I know a ridiculously tall man grabs my bag off my back and tells\
  \ me to follow him.  The NYC I had dreamed of was starting to appear but I was so\
  \ nervous I was being robbed I didn't want to loose the man with my bag.  We stop\
  \ on Broadway and west 48th. Opposite the Hershey building (we will eat there later)\
  \  and as I walk into a lobby I knew I didn't belong at the said \"Jenna, we have\
  \ been expecting you\". The tall man ushers me into a lift and proceeds to press\
  \ PH2. I'm totally being sold as a sex slave.  Everything my mother has ever said\
  \ is rushing into my brain.  Wear two pairs of underpants, don't walk at night on\
  \ your own.  Turns out the penthouse is owned by a lovely Chinese man who said he\
  \ \"saw me at the airport\" and wanted to upgrade me.  That's when I learnt New\
  \ Yorkers are one of a kind.  They will give you the shirt off there back if it\
  \ makes your stay better.  I will always love the big apple,  and I enjoyed the\
  \ bite I took. It's got crunch and it fills your soul!"
