Text: "70 years, four continents, and three languages. A myriad of photos and iPhone\
  \ video recordings of friends sharing memories and favorite stories. Seven decades\
  \ captured in a 20 minute montage honoring this man\u2019s life. This was my birthday\
  \ gift to my dad. A man who has traveled the world out of curiosity, and at times,\
  \ out of necessity. My sense of adventure, and my nose, come from him. \n\nThere\u2019\
  s magic in traveling. My early 20\u2019s were spent living in Central America and\
  \ Asia; feeling most bewitched while connecting with complete strangers sharing\
  \ stories, a meal, or attempting to speak a hybrid language of our native tongues.\
  \ \n\nThe last four years of my life have been spent working at a software company\
  \ as a Human Resources professional entering data and auditing reports. It\u2019\
  s December in Boston. I\u2019m pale, I\u2019m cold, and uninspired. \n\nScrolling\
  \ through the black hole that is Facebook, an ad appears for The Salty Pelican Yoga\
  \ & Surf Retreat in Portugal. It\u2019s been two years since I\u2019ve left the\
  \ country. I\u2019m not what you\u2019d call a yogi, and I\u2019m definitely not\
  \ what you\u2019d call a surfer, but I decide that\u2019s my sign. I book a seven\
  \ day package and flight which included a 24 hour layover in Ireland on my way home.\n\
  \nThe absolute beauty and nightmare of traveling alone is that you have nobody to\
  \ answer to but yourself. You do and participate in anything you please, whenever\
  \ you please. It\u2019s liberating, and it\u2019s slightly terrifying all at once.\
  \ There\u2019s magic in traveling, but even more so in solo travel.\n\nThis retreat\
  \ far exceeded my expectations.\nMorning yoga on the pier. Slightly aggressive winter\
  \ waves crashing into the jetty surrounding you. Sunrise rays hitting your skin\
  \ as you contort, or try to contort, your body into eagle pose. Surf lessons after\
  \ a nourishing breakfast topped off with an adorable mini Pastel de Nata. Restoring\
  \ your body with afternoon Yin Yoga taught by Sonia, the resident yoga instructor,\
  \ and descendent of Buddha I\u2019m certain. Hikes, group dinners, and so much more.\n\
  \nA week of consistent yoga, meditation, and being in nature truly starts to seep\
  \ into your subconscious. I found myself saying things like \u201Cmindful\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cthe universe\u201D regularly. I felt wholly in tune with myself.\n\n\
  The events of the last day of the trip only reaffirmed my newfound woo-woo mentality.\
  \ When I landed at Dublin Airport I realized I had no actual game plan in place.\
  \ My phone ends up dying, so I aimlessly - or some might say mindfully - wander\
  \ the busier areas of the city.\n\nI stumble into a free comedy act. An hour later\
  \ I join a twenty person pub crawl. At the third bar I jokingly say, \u201CWhat\
  \ if this is a silent rave?!\u201D. Our group enters to find they are handing out\
  \ headphones because it WAS a silent rave. \u201CCoincidences\u201D like that continued\
  \ to happen throughout the night.\n\nThe most dangerous part of solo travel, the\
  \ part I forgot about, is the reminder of what could be. The reminder of that first\
  \ time I left the country, of that overwhelmingly joyous feeling you get while standing\
  \ in the back of a bumpy 4x4 ride through the Guatemalan jungle, of that feeling\
  \ you can\u2019t explain that almost brings you to tears. It\u2019s the reminder\
  \ of how much more of this world there is to experience, and the reminder to not\
  \ bury your life while you\u2019re still alive.\n\nWhen the highlight reel of my\
  \ life plays at my 70th birthday party I want to watch in awe and admiration for\
  \ the person I was and for the person I became; for the courage I had to follow\
  \ my gut, to travel the world, to learn and grow from strangers that became old\
  \ friends. I want to think, \u201CWhat a crazy son of a bitch\u201D while grinning\
  \ from ear to ear. I want to be thankful for how one decision led to another allowing\
  \ the right opportunities to present themselves. Portugal has sparked something\
  \ fierce inside of me. I came on a whim, not knowing it would realign my priorities,\
  \ reignite the flame within; and steer me in this new, but deeply-rooted path."
