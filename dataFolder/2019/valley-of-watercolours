Text: "Having several weeks off over the summer Grace and I had decided to travel\
  \ together through the Southern Chinese province of Yunnan. Visiting the must-see\
  \ temples and cities along the way, we heard of a tiny place. Hard to reach, limited\
  \ nightlife, not designed for international tourists. Lacking English signage, we\
  \ would be forced to put our language skills to the test. A postcard perfect vista\
  \ of lotus flowers and surrounded by water it promised something we had both been\
  \ missing since coming to the heavily populated city we lived in: unmanicured, green,\
  \ natural beauty. Enamoured at the prospect of fresh air and the chance to get some\
  \ top pics for Instagram; what did we have to lose? We booked a hostel that night\
  \ and left the next day.\nThe bus ride was a nightmare. Small, rickety, and being\
  \ driven by someone who presumably had life insurance we made friends while commiserating\
  \ with two Chinese students who had the same idea and were regretting it equally.\
  \ Sliding into a taxi for the final leg was much more comfortable though harder\
  \ on our wallets. This time as we sped along the buildings were further apart, the\
  \ fields were greener, and air refreshing. A final turn and we slowed to a crawl\
  \ passing stalls of food, paddle-boats, and tourist knick-knacks all brightly coloured\
  \ and loud with the sound of bartering. Horse-drawn carts moved alongside city taxis\
  \ swapping passengers and gossip. Our driver directing us to a friend of his to\
  \ get to our hostel. The village doesn\u2019t allow cars. Grateful at the forced\
  \ novelty of a new method of transport we had a token discussion over the merits\
  \ of saving money by walking into town. Instead we spent the ride taking selfies\
  \ in an open-air carriage and admiring the flowers growing alongside the dirt road.\
  \ \n\u201CWill you be awake for sunrise\u201D? the students asked, startling both\
  \ of us into sheepish laughter \u201CNot if we can avoid it\u201D! The next morning,\
  \ they would be waking at 5am to climb a hill and watch the sunrise. It was beautiful,\
  \ the best sunrise in Yunnan Province we were promised. Grace and I hesitant struggled\
  \ to decline and it was no match for their insistence, a 5am start for an hour trek\
  \ uphill\u2026what a way to spend a holiday.\nThe ground was uneven in the dark,\
  \ the track narrow and crowded even with only a dozen other tourists. It was a steep\
  \ walk hindered as much by the slippery path as our own lack of fitness; promises\
  \ to join a gym were grumbled frequently over the next hour. Reaching the peak overshadowed\
  \ by gratitude at the chance to regain our breath.\nThe peak was narrow, 10 meters\
  \ across, with several handy trees to lean against (or in my case trip over) but\
  \ even in the heavy shadows the sight was already impressive. Higher than expected\
  \ we could see incredibly far in any direction. \nThen the sun rose; not suddenly\
  \ as it does at the coast breaking over the water in an instant but with light pooling\
  \ around the hills. Lighting section by section so that your eyes were forced to\
  \ follow its path. A beam broke free to cut across the lake setting it glittering\
  \ blue and white even at our distance. Then the sun slipped over the highest peak\
  \ and we could see everything. The village tucked between two hills, the vast lotus\
  \ growing out in all directions with small green islands dotting the lakes, brightly\
  \ coloured pinpricks the hats of already working fishermen in their muddy brown\
  \ boats. The low-lying clouds that had been of such concern to us earlier had conspired\
  \ to create a vivid rainbow stretching away to our left and in front of us the lotus\
  \ turned the lakes a watercolour pink. \nThe sun up, mosquitoes returned, and the\
  \ moment moved on. We took some amazing photos and the obligatory selfies trying\
  \ to relish it (and delay the descent) grateful, more than ever, to pushy roommates.\n\
  Puzhehei truly is a place unlike any I\u2019ve seen before or since, and though\
  \ I am unlikely to return, I will never forget the sun rising like an artist over\
  \ the fields of painted lotus."
