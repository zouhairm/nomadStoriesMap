Text: "When we set out from Amsterdam to Mozambique, we didn't know what to expect\
  \ with a late flight on December 26. Under the pressure of a late decision, we just\
  \ wanted to arrive in Maputo. Whiles in the capital, we began the search for possible\
  \ holiday destinations outside the capital. We wanted to be alone. We did not take\
  \ with us any electronic gadget, not even a watch. A hotel business centre was plan\
  \ b.\nEverywhere appeared full. \n Luckily for us,(we thought we were lucky at that\
  \ point) we found a space on booking.com for a place on Ibo Island after a long\
  \ search. That luck was short-lived as we received a call from Miti Miwiri, telling\
  \ us that they forgot to update their booking records. In other less euphemistic\
  \ terms, there was actually no space for us although we already booked a place.\
  \ \n\nBut the Miti Miwiri guys had an alternative recommendation for us - Qurimba\
  \ Islands.\n\nAs part of an archipelago of about 32 islands, including Ibo, Matemo,\
  \ Medjumbe, Metundo, Quisiva, Vamizi Island and Rolas Island all going up to the\
  \ Tanzanian border, the Quiribas stand out as special with a different experience.\n\
  \n The Quirimbas Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off northeastern Mozambique, close\
  \ to Pemba, the capital of the province of Cabo Delgado.\n\nThe Indian Ocean is\
  \ currently rotating between low and high tides in every six (6) hrs. And travelling\
  \ from the mainland or between Islands by boat is highly dependent on the tide.\
  \ However, there are chartered flights from Pemba to the various Islands.\n\nQuirimba\
  \ is a single vila island adventure experience provided by Reiner Gessner a white\
  \ Mozambiquan man (third generation German). Reiner is totally eccentric with a\
  \ very unconventional but agreeable world view. His philosophy is  ''you arrive\
  \ as a stranger and you leave as a friend''.\n\nThe Island has a population of 50,000\
  \ but only about 30% of the land is occupied by the villagers in this Island located\
  \ within the forest reserve.\n\nThe remaining 70% provides the Island adventure\
  \ experience.  SISI and RASCAL are the two main companions of the man who provides\
  \ this experience.  The two dogs are as welcoming as their master who calls them\
  \ his ''children''. To find the Quirimba Island, it has to come from recommendations\
  \ from others. This is because it is not advertised online and it is also not available\
  \ on booking.com since it is a private guest house.\n\nAs a former professional\
  \ chef for close to four (4) decades of experience in South Africa, Reiner provides\
  \ the most sumptuous and healthiest seafood freshly obtained from the Indian Ocean\
  \ and from his farms.\n\nVegetable farms, coffee farms, fruit trees, provide freshly\
  \ made brunch and dinner in generous proportions.  The early morning coffee from\
  \ Reiner's farm is the best you can get anywhere. On a good day, when the tides\
  \ are high, a visit by boat to the next Ibo Island amplifies the adventure experience.\
  \  If you are lucky, with low tides during the journey, you may enjoy the view of\
  \ sandbanks in the middle of the ocean. \n\n\nThe flat undulating nature and land\
  \ of the Quirimba Island with several crossroads also provide room and challenge\
  \ for trekking and hiking from one side of the ocean to the other through the forest.\n\
  \ This exercise could offer the opportunity to see monkeys and other harmless mammals.\
  \  You may also enjoy baobab fruits as the fruitful savanna tree abound the Quirimba.\n\
  \nEarly morning on the Quirimba Island, you will like to witness the rising of the\
  \ sun from the east over the vast ocean. If you miss the sunrise, just wait for\
  \ it to set. It is an amazing sight to behold.\n\nIf you are looking to enjoy a\
  \ serene atmosphere while on holiday, a natural environment but not out of touch\
  \ with civilization, a place with a library where you can read or write intensively\
  \ without distraction whiles enjoying the priceless hospitality of your host, look\
  \ no further.\n\nWe went to Quirimba Island as strangers, intending to stay for\
  \ three days. In the end, We stayed for eight days. And I highly recommend for wannabe\
  \ adventurers and travellers to Mozambique who wants to experience the unexpected."
