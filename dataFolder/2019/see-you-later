  \ take this pay the cab\". \n\"I am sorry i cant take this\".\nHe insisted, she\
  \ accepted and paid for the cab ride.\n\nArun and had met 5 years ago at a friends\
  \ wedding. I was freshly divorced and he was just out of a very bad relationship,\
  \ what a combination. Our common friend introduced us and there were immediate fireworks.\
  \ He hand shake was firm, he looked me into the eyes and smiled. We spoke, met,\
  \ dated and soon got into a relationship. It almost felt as if we had known each\
  \ other for ever. It felt like this was the perfect relationship i was waiting for\
  \ all my life. Everything was perfect, it felt just right. Then the day came, when\
  \ he proposed marriage which was icing on the cake. Soon, families got involved,\
  \ dates were discussed and decided. All of this was happening too soon, but it felt\
  \ so good. As the day came closer, i started doubting my decision. Was i making\
  \ the same mistake again? Is this right for the both of us? Isn't this happening\
  \ too soon? I think we shouldn't have rushed this decision. I think it is a rebound.\
  \ I think i should have thought this through. I think i wanted to live my life after\
  \ my divorce, explore the world, introspect, explore myself. I panicked. I dint\
  \ know what to do. In a rather Hollywood style, one night i packed some basic clothing\
  \ and necessities and eloped from the house, leaving a note behind. 'I am sorry\
  \ Arun, i am not sure if i want to be married again, i need time to think, think\
  \ what i want, when i want, i want to travel see the world, dont try to find me,\
  \ i will figure it out.\nI set out my right foot and started my journey. I took\
  \ the first bus to a neighboring village that i always fascinated since childhood.\
  \ I reached there early morning, i knocked on a door and a old frail woman opened\
  \ the door. I told her i was seeking some shelter for a few days and would you mind\
  \ me staying with you for a new days. I stayed there for a few days and realized\
  \ how difficult it was to hunt for work and feed you family every day. But the family\
  \ did so without complains and lived rather happily. My next destination was a long\
  \ lost friend who I had lost touched with for a very silly reason. I got in touch\
  \ and met her. Meeting her taught me that it takes years to build a relationship\
  \ but just a moment to break it, you should value people in your life and or what\
  \ contribution they make. I then lived at a yoga center for a month where i wasn't\
  \ suppose to talk at all. Everyone around only smiled and spoke to each other with\
  \ gestures. It was extremely frustrating for the first few days, rather torturous\
  \ but it only got better with time. By the end of the workshop, i had felt emotions\
  \ that i had never felt before. This was precious. I was to cherish this all my\
  \ life. I had clarity, i somehow knew what i wanted and what i did not. I backed\
  \ my bags, with a smile on my face, i was ready to speak and tell the world what\
  \ i wanted. I had traveled alone in the last few months. I took a cab and reached\
  \ home. I was looking for change in all the pockets, but did not find any.\"Here,\
  \ take this\" he said.\n'I am sorry?'\n\"You dint seem to have change, take this\
  \ pay the cab\". \n\"I am sorry i cant take this\".\nHe insisted, she accepted and\
  \ paid for the cab ride\nWhile i was travelling alone for the last few months, i\
  \ had forgotten that you need a companion to travel. Arun was by my side at all\
  \ times, patiently waiting for me while i decided to explore. Not physically, but\
  \ he had traveled with me spiritually. Now, I knew what i wanted :)"
