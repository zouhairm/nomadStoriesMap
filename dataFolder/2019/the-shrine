Text: "\u2018Welkom, Na De Shrine!\u2019 read a white on purple sign at the entrance\
  \ of the graffiti building. A bouncer in a lime green T-shirt performed quick pat-downs\
  \ before letting the guests through. Vertical brick walls of custard yellow steered\
  \ our crew of four into the darkened core of Nigeria\u2019s famous attraction. The\
  \ Shrine. \n\u201CThese are all street people,\u201D my Lagos-based friend, Emeka\
  \ had said when we stepped out of a keke-maruwa or taxi outside the Shrine.\n\u201C\
  But it is midnight,\u201D I argued, pointing a puzzled look down NERDC Road. The\
  \ street was teeming with seemingly aimless young people bathed in neon lights.\
  \ \u201CWhat are they doing in the streets at this hour?\u201D \nOn the flesh, the\
  \ Shrine appears mundane. Within, it is a lively picture with a stage and a balcony\
  \ curving around the wide space. When we wandered into the moshpit, around fifty\
  \ people were plastered against multicolored chairs, focused on the stage where\
  \ a band was testing guitar chords and drums.\n\u201CGoat meat!\u201D Under-aged\
  \ hawkers shoved trays of roasted meat at us when we sat down at a table. A lanky\
  \ guy in a faded red bull baseball cap took our order.\n\u201CSK, Arizona, or Mali?\u201D\
  \ Another guy approached our table.\n\u201CMali,\u201D Emeka said.\nThe guy reached\
  \ into his pink Barbie waist bag and pressed a small package into Emeka\u2019s hand,\
  \ in exchange for cash.\n\u201CWhat are you doing?\u201D I whispered to Emeka when\
  \ he poured the contents of the clear plastic bag on the table and started separating\
  \ the seeds from the grass. \u201CYou\u2019ll be arrested.\u201D\nEmeka merely smiled\
  \ as he rolled a perfect joint, brought it to life, and took a drag. \u201CThis\
  \ is the Shrine. No one will arrest me.\u201D His declaration was confident, smoke\
  \ rushing out of his nostrils.\nI stared at him stupidly. His meaning only registered\
  \ when I took a good look around the dim room. The bulk of the Shrine\u2019s patrons\
  \ were either inhaling or exhaling smoke. Others seemed content lounging in the\
  \ mist. Most had that spaced-out, red-eyed look about them that could only be gotten\
  \ from consuming marijuana. Their comportment held no trace of the fear associated\
  \ with publicly indulging in an illegal habit. I wondered how I'd missed the smell.\
  \ \n\u201CEmmanuel Macron was here last month,\u201D Emeka said passing the joint.\n\
  The smoke provoked a cough in my lungs like it sometimes did with the good stuff,\
  \ but a sip of Smirnoff Ice took away the burning sensation.\n\u201CWhat? Why would\
  \ the president of France come to a place like this?\u201D\n\u201CHe was here in\
  \ 2002 as a student. Obviously, he liked it enough to revisit.\u201D\n\u201CDid\
  \ he smoke?\u201D\n\u201CNo idea.\u201D Emeka chuckled. \u201CMany influential people\
  \ come here.\u201D\n\u201CBut weed is illegal in Africa.  Except for South Africa.\u201D\
  \n\u201CThis place is off limits to the police. You can smoke as much weed as you\
  \ want as long as you are inside the Shrine.\n\u201CFela Kuti founded the Shrine\
  \ in 1970 as a safe haven for his social movement. The original shrine was burnt\
  \ down in 1977 when the activist recorded an album called \u201CZombie\u201D criticizing\
  \ the Nigerian military. This isn\u2019t just a place where people come to get high,\
  \ it a commune immersed in arts and culture.\u201D\nI understood then why there\
  \ were pictures and quotes from Fela covering the walls amid splashes of green,\
  \ red, and yellow.\nWhen I boarded a ninety-five-minute flight from Douala to Lagos\
  \ the previous day to visit Emeka, I didn\u2019t expect to find a place like the\
  \ Shrine. Cameroon and Nigeria have similar cultures. I\u2019d expected a familiar\
  \ set-up\u2014rubbish on the side of congested roads, foul-mouthed customs officers\
  \ at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport shamelessly extorting money from\
  \ travelers, random guys outside the airport pulling at my bags begging to help\
  \ carry them for a small prize, pickup showing up late.\nThe Shrine was a surprise.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t the weed I found fascinating; it was the thought of doing something\
  \ so illegal, under the supervision of the law, in a continent that outlaws unconventionality,\
  \ and dodging justice.\nOn the walls, the signs mocked us.\nDRUGS ARE NOT ALLOWED\
  \ IN THE SHRINE! \nNO SMOKING!\nDRUGS ARE A DANGER TO SOCIETY!"
