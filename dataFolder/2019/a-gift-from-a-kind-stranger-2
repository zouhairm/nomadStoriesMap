Text: "I arrived in Kyoto and made my way towards the backpacker hostel, K\u2019s\
  \ House. I\u2019ve stayed in hostels before, and I\u2019ve grown comfortable in\
  \ sharing a room with fellow travellers, sharing stories, befriending strangers\
  \ who all share the passion of exploring. I stepped into my four-bedroom room and\
  \ organized my things, made my bed and charged my phone. A few moments later, an\
  \ elderly man entered and sat on the bed beside me. We exchanged looks, \u201CHello.\u201D\
  \ I said, and he smiled and said, \u201CHello, where are you from?\u201D I smiled,\
  \ \u201CSydney, Australia. What about yourself?\u201D \n\u201CSorry, my English\
  \ is not that good. But I am from a small town in Hokkaido. Can you speak Japanese?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CChotto. Watashi wa Louisa des\u201D (\u201CA little. I\u2019m Louisa.\u201D\
  ) \n\u201CYour Japanese is very good. I\u2019m Mori.\u201D \n\u201CHajimemashite!\u201D\
  \ (Nice to meet you!) I beamed, gesturing my hand out. \n\u201CHajimemashite\u201D\
  \ Mori replied, and he shook my hand. \nMori began to tell me that he was 60 years\
  \ old, and had been exploring Japan completely solo. He taught me some Japanese\
  \ phrases, some tips on travelling, his family and that he was just in Kyoto for\
  \ a little stopover. \nI told him in a mixture of chotto Japanese and English that\
  \ I had finished my studies, wanted to keep travelling, and that I loved Japan so\
  \ much, particularly Japanese food. We shared a few laughs, and he urged me to follow\
  \ my dreams, as I was still young, able and full of ambition. I really appreciated\
  \ his encouragement and support, and even though I only knew him for less than half\
  \ an hour, this conversation reinforced why I loved meeting strangers on my travels.\
  \ After we finished talking, I went out to grab some dinner, called my family back\
  \ in Sydney, and planned what I was going to do the next day. The next day I left\
  \ early to go sightseeing, and when I came back to my hostel room, I noticed something\
  \ on my bed. The first thought I had was that someone had claimed my bed and their\
  \ belongings were on it, and I was already assuming the worst when it came to staying\
  \ in a shared room. However, after looking closely, I saw an old, used novel lying\
  \ there. I was the only person in the room at the time and thought that it was mistakenly\
  \ placed on my bed by one of the other stayers in my room. I grabbed the book THE\
  \ LUCK FACTOR that was the title of the book, followed by the tagline Four Simple\
  \ Principles that will change your luck \u2013 and your life written by Richard\
  \ Wiserman. \nI was curious and saw an elastic band was tied around it. After removing\
  \ it, there were two small notes inside. The first note read, \n\nThis book is a\
  \ present for you. \nThis book and the another book will make you happy and ssuccess!\n\
  From Mr. Mori \n\nThe second note was a list of book recommendations. My heart became\
  \ so full when I read Mori\u2019s note, and learning what the book was about. My\
  \ sister always says, \u201CThe universe works in funny ways.\u201D And I believe\
  \ it was the universe, luck, and fate that led me to meet Mori, and I wish I had\
  \ the opportunity to see him again so I could express my gratitude to him. Even\
  \ though this book is rough on the edges and pre-owned I view it as pre-loved. This\
  \ is one of my favourite gifts I have received in my entire life, and it was simply\
  \ from talking to a stranger who happened to stay in the same room as I, sharing\
  \ our stories and accomplishments but most importantly \u2013 just listening to\
  \ each other. Despite the language barrier and the small mistakes in his note, we\
  \ were able to communicate seamlessly and I like to think that Mori thought it was\
  \ luck meeting me too, and that gifting me this book was the perfect way to tell\
  \ me."
