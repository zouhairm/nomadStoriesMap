Text: Traveling is always an invitation to a new reality and discovery. On my last
  trip I stayed in a hostel, I confess, I faced fears and anxieties, sleep and be
  in the same room with strangers was an offshoot of life ignored prejudices, fears
  and people and I was challenged, I met and grew up. It was the end of the year,
  the city was packed and we became friends, as the days passed, we were no longer
  strangers in the same room, we were young in search of the new, to search for live.
  The experiences were amazing, from conversations around the pool even before bed,
  or even when the insomnia took care of our bodies. This trip has taught me that
  there are amazing people of North, South and Southeast, and the distance between
  the places doesn't compare with what we feel or want. We always need to have a goal,
  a purpose of life always in mind, because, between the sky and the Earth, billions
  of souls who are looking for a place to call your. Some find this place easily,
  others never find it, because they can't accommodate. They are here for discoveries,
  then your place is anywhere. Believe so can be my soul I thirst to live the unknown,
  learn and meet new realities. In this immensity which we call world there's wonderful
  things that I still want to see, people and cultures to explore, each experience
  is unique and intense, I hope that this dream of getting to know another country
  than my, can be real. In this life, I have learned that we must fight and believe
  that it is possible to make our dreams come true, because no matter what, every
  day a story full of excitement, surprises and achievements is written.
