Text: "I am standing at the dimly lit luggage carousel for what feels like an eternity.\
  \ The large crowd that exited the plane with me has long gone and all that is left\
  \ are two other passengers waiting for their bags.  I have arrived in San Jose,\
  \ Costa Rica for a language immersion program in which I will be staying with a\
  \ host family who only speaks Spanish. Feelings of panic ensue due to the fact I\
  \ have ignored all of the travel advice I have read and did not pack extra clothes,\
  \ important items or hard to come by necessities in my carryon. The contents of\
  \ my carryon mainly consist of chocolate, Doritos, and jelly beans which by some\
  \ could be deemed necessities but nothing in my bag will be very useful unless I\
  \ am starving or need a sugar rush. I report my luggage missing and I am greeted\
  \ by the most cheerful woman. I grumpily fill out the report and as I am leaving\
  \ she says, \u201CPura Vida\u201D. I look at her confused because this translates\
  \ literally to \u201Cpure life\u201D. I say nothing thinking maybe I heard wrong\
  \ and just smile.\n\nI leave the airport and go outside to look for the driver who\
  \ will escort me to my host family. He asks if I am Katie and I tell him I am. I\
  \ also sadly tell him my lost luggage saga in the best Spanish I can muster which\
  \ probably sounds about as confident as a 2 year old. He responds with a huge smile,\
  \ welcomes me to Costa Rica, tells me not to worry and says, \u201CPura Vida\u201D\
  . I am now sure I am hearing this right, I ask him what Pura Vida means and he explains\
  \ that this is the country\u2019s slogan and way of life. It can be used in a multitude\
  \ of scenarios, when greeting someone you can say Pura Vida, instead of goodbye\
  \ you can use Pura Vida, if someone asks you how you are you can respond with Pura\
  \ Vida and even if asked how the food at a restaurant is you can answer with Pura\
  \ Vida to explain you enjoyed it. In this case when the driver uses Pura Vida it\
  \ would translate to \u201CThat\u2019s Life\u201D.\nWe arrive at the home where\
  \ I will be staying. The driver brings me to the door and knocks but no one is home.\
  \ We wait outside some time when the driver decides to call the woman who I will\
  \ be staying with. She answers and says she totally forgot I was coming and I can\
  \ hear her hearty laugh through the phone. She continues to tell the driver that\
  \ they are at a big family reunion and asks the driver to instead drop me off at\
  \ the party. The last thing I want to do is go to a party after hours of flying,\
  \ sweating, hair standing up and no way to freshen up but what can I do. . The driver\
  \ can sense my hesitation but guides me to the car and shrugs his shoulders uttering\
  \ my new favorite phrase, Pura Vida.\n\nThis is only the beginning of my adventures\
  \ in Costa Rica. I spend my time doing everything completely out of my comfort zone.\
  \ I communicate daily in Spanish. I go on trips alone to beautiful volcanoes and\
  \ beaches. I discover snakes and bugs bigger then my hand in my room and my reaction\
  \ of utter hysteria gives my host family the best laughs of their lives. I meet\
  \ people who feel like total strangers at first but end up feeling like family that\
  \ was missing from my life.\n\nFor me, Pura Vida represents the marvelous way Costa\
  \ Ricans live their lives to the fullest, appreciating the simplest things. It reminds\
  \ me to step back and enjoy my surroundings, to not rush, to relish time with friends\
  \ and family and actually live life. Pura Vida becomes a mantra to live by even\
  \ when I realize I have left all my souvenirs in a bag in the taxi I took to the\
  \ airport to fly home ( you cannot make this stuff up) but hey \u2013 Pura Vida."
