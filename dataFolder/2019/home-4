Text: "Home \n\nSkipping swiftly and valiantly into the past battle grounds of Mr\
  \ Che Guevara himself, after a strenuous two day, roundabout journey, the eagerness\
  \ and excitement multiplied as the air suddenly changed, the streets filled with\
  \ a string of instant attention drawing, multicoloured structures, vintage transportation\
  \ whizzing past ever so slightly blowing the fringe out your face, and the ever\
  \ increasing bulging and pounding rhythm that thumped through the very core of your\
  \ existence\u2026\u2019Pa pa u pa pa pa\u2019\u2026the simplest, yet most universal\
  \ language known to man: Musica. \nWhilst helping these foreigners settle in, tears\
  \ as clear as crystal beads, slowly trickled down his cheeks, longing etched over\
  \ the mountainous contours of his face, Frank, our host, yearned for the chance\
  \ to be let out the country to visit his emigrated sister as easily as we chacha\u2019\
  d our way in. Sitting and brewing over the stories of locals, we waited while the\
  \ faint whistle of the kettle got incessantly louder, and as it hit it\u2019s climax,\
  \ it was time to sit down to some tea and golden brown home baked treats. \nAnd\
  \ just like that, like a sudden rip in the space-time continuum, the mood backflipped\
  \ from a sombre one to that of a B12 booster, as we fought the exhausted, heavy\
  \ eyelids and marched our way to the weekly rumba festival, not just brimming, but\
  \ overflowing with the pure rawness, love, life, culture, expressiveness, comradery\
  \ and passion of dance. Surrounded by talented individuals, embracing every second\
  \ like today was already a distant memory, graffiti murals encompassing the essence\
  \ of the people, art carved into the very foundation of the building, the ultimate\
  \ thirst quenching mojitos filled with dripping, fresh mint, and ice clanking against\
  \ the side of the glass, the adrenalin levels hit the puffy clouds floating casually\
  \ across the nearly clear sky. \nReluctantly leaving, now all wide eyed and ready\
  \ for a repeat, we strolled past taxi drivers shining their cars, people peeking\
  \ out their windows emulating an extra in a Disney movie, kind eyes and sheer warm\
  \ smiles as we were greeted by street musicians, and at that very moment as I turned\
  \ back, brushing the hair out my face and holding my dress between my legs, was\
  \ greeted by a canvas encapsulating the montage of colours of the sunset as a backdrop\
  \ over the colourful city of what I would describe as nothing less than, free.\n\
  Every day filled with salsa on the beach, bonding, learning about the origin of\
  \ the styles of dance and genres of music, and tours to cigar factories. Every night\
  \ starting off with a concert, a gentle tap on the shoulder the most beautiful lead,\
  \ footwork and dances to last through the absolute sands of time. Locals who started\
  \ off as acquaintances and teachers became friends and nothing less than familia.\
  \ \nMy heart beat to the rhythm of these drums, the feeling as if the fantasy world\
  \ in my head exploded and became this country. Always having this longing to belong\
  \ somewhere, this fractured, wandering soul and young, dancing heart was finally\u2026\
  home."
