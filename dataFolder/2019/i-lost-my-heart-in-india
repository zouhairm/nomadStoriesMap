Text: "Something about the Indian culture has drawn me in from a very young age. \n\
  \nI used to make my stepdad go on weekend adventures with me to find every single\
  \ little Indian shop in our area, where I would buy magazines and fabric swatches\
  \ to make Indian inspired collages to put on my walls at home. I studied India more\
  \ than I studied anything in school. The fashion, the food, the hundreds of different\
  \ religions, cultures and languages within India. I dreamed of visiting the country,\
  \ I would wear their clothes and drink way too much Chai. I wanted to go and actually\
  \ talk to the people and get a better understanding of their culture. I was obsessed.\
  \ \n\nIn July of 2015 I finally got to go. Honestly, when we arrived in Chennai,\
  \ I immediately hated it and wanted to just turn around and go home. The airport\
  \ was hot, crowded and dirty with plain walls. I got stopped and interrogated by\
  \ an immigration officer for over an hour. When we stepped outside it was humid\
  \ and smelled less than ideal. There was a stray dog laying on the ground, the security\
  \ guard was holding a huge gun and a bunch of people were taking pictures of me(?).\
  \ It was about one o'clock in the morning when we left the airport so the drive\
  \ to our hotel was dark, but all I could see were people sleeping on the streets,\
  \ more people sleeping on the streets than I have ever seen in my life. Living in\
  \ San Francisco, California, it's not unheard of to see people on the streets, but\
  \ this was different. Mothers with multiple children were laying in the dirt on\
  \ the side of our equivalence to a freeway. I knew I would witness poverty in India,\
  \ but this was not what I had dreamed of, when I dreamed of visiting India. \n\n\
  After the rough first night ended and I saw the country in the daylight, I started\
  \ to fall in love with the country just as I dreamt I would. The busy colorful streets,\
  \ the decorative cows walking around all over the place, people warmly welcoming\
  \ a crowd of foreigners with the biggest smiles ever. All the markets full of flowers,\
  \ fruit, handmade baskets, Sari shops, barefoot kids running around playing cricket,\
  \ the jingle of the bangles and anklets that all the women wore.  Now that is what\
  \ I had in mind, in fact it blew my expectations away. \n\nWe spent most of our\
  \ time in a small village a few hours south of Chennai where we stayed at an orphanage.\
  \ We played with and loved the kids who lived there. I painted the girl's nails\
  \ and braided their hair and they gave me henna tattoos. They taught us the games\
  \ they play and how to play cricket. We walked the Kid's to school through the village,\
  \ where we got to know some of the village people. We made Jewelry with the village\
  \ ladies to help them make a living. (I now sell their jewelry here in the states).\
  \ We also ate delicious food and drank WAY too much Chai. \n\nThe most significant\
  \ day of my stay in the orphanage is one that will always haunt me when I close\
  \ my eyes. The day I had to pull a little girl out of her fathers arms and watch\
  \ her scream, kick and cry as he said goodbye forever. The orphanage was her new\
  \ home, and the other kids there were her new family. She had two brothers with\
  \ her and fortunately my close friend was standing with me to handle the situation\
  \ better than I could have alone. Their mother had recently died and their father\
  \ could not afford to take care of them anymore. In India a life in an impoverished\
  \ village can be very dangerous for children, especially young girls. Their father\
  \ wanted a better life for them and was fortunate enough to get them into this orphanage.\
  \ I felt incredibly privileged to be the first experience that little girl had after\
  \ being taken away from her father. \n\nMy heart has been lost somewhere in India\
  \ for three years now."
