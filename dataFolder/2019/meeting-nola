Text: Copplestone pressed on bare feet, only a slight reminder of the many paths,
  whom have crossed the same as I. With this brings an even greater appreciation,
  of not only the public arts surrounding me, but also; the history, the culture,
  the ambience that overtakes all I thought I had a thirst for. It's like when you
  take your first bite of that food you have been craving for way too long! This city
  has me feeling like dancing with all the colors of smooth soulful rhythms that it
  has been able to keep alive for generations! Tradition is a great influence here.
  The energy is rich and alive with French and Spanish inspired vibes. (swamps included)
  More attributes this city brings include; a large Creole population that maintains
  it's roots, thus contributing, to the millions of visitors every year. One of the
  most known, but maybe not the most celebrated events to take place here is Mardi
  Gras. My personal favorite is the live music on almost every corner and the food
  that has managed to keep it's authenticity here, only to be imitated elsewhere.
  (take it from me, I ate enough for two families, lol) Prices are not bad, but be
  prepared for humidity if you go during certain times of the year. If you're looking
  to travel in the United States, this is worth a pin on your map for sure!
