Text: "During my visit to Hong Kong, the very famous Ocean Park was a part of my itinerary.\
  \ I went there expecting to see pandas, enjoy the cable car ride and leave. What\
  \ I didn't expect from the cable car ride were the breathtaking views of the mountains\
  \ and sea that surround the park. Although I was there in the hot, sultry afternoon\
  \ the sunshine glistened in the waters and I found myself admiring the stunning\
  \ views from the cable car from great heights and also certain points in the park.\
  \ At the very moment I found myself wanting to visit one of the beaches on the island\
  \ I remembered reading about. You see, the views that I were admiring did not have\
  \ any sandy beaches although the sea surrounds the entire area. Hong Kong itself\
  \ is a geographically unique place that seems like big chunks of mountain islands\
  \ where chipped and developed into a humongous city. \n\nAs soon as I was done with\
  \ my to-do list at the park, I got on a double-decker bus ride to the end of Hong\
  \ Kong Island. There is a popular beach that goes by the name of Repulse Bay where\
  \ I decided to get off. It seemed scary at first, because it is a bit far from the\
  \ hustle and the skyscrapers of the city. But as soon as I walked a green trail\
  \ of trees with the beach visible from a distance - I knew I was in love! \n\nThere\
  \ were a number of stairs that I had to climb down because the entire area is basically\
  \ great, big mountains. As soon as my feet reached the sandy surface, I was hit\
  \ with a cool breeze. It was close to sun down and the beach was rather quiet. Spare\
  \ a few families, pretty much everyone seemed to be there for relaxation. I think\
  \ I went there for the same purpose. The sea can give people a calming effect and\
  \ can sometimes be the perfect place to kick back and relax - after one had a loud\
  \ and eventful day.\n\nIf someone had asked me before I went to Hong Kong about\
  \ why I was visiting, I would have said that it was to enjoy the city. Ironically\
  \ I found an alternate appeal to Hong Kong - mountains and the sea which served\
  \ as an amazing source of peace and relaxation during the trip. Repulse Bay is a\
  \ rather known place by locals, albeit a little less explored by the tourists. There\
  \ are not many beaches in the entire island so traveling greater distances to enjoy\
  \ the sea waves seems like a rewarding thing to do. \n\nI do know that Repulse Bay\
  \ might not have been the most beautiful beach I have been to, but it is was surely\
  \ unique and has a vibe that no other beach can replicate. I would list this in\
  \ the big gems of Hong Kong and recommend everyone to get there to enjoy the stunning\
  \ views along the way. Driving with sea on one side and mountains on other can feel\
  \ quite cool to someone like me who has lived in a flat and no-beach place all her\
  \ life. Plus the sunshine - the sunshine is always a positive part."
