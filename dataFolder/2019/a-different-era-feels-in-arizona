Text: "Me and my ex boyfriend went  on a trip to Arizona, prior to that we were debating\
  \ of whether to go or not.  But since we love to travel, and I had been dreaming\
  \ about seeing the Grand Canyon, we made it.  It's been days travelling on the road,\
  \ my ex beau drove while I just sit, took pictures and nap.  We passed several U.S.\
  \ states and we're from Toronto.  Imagine, driving for days, fatigued, boredom at\
  \ the same time exciting seeing those beautiful scenery once we've only seen on\
  \ movies.\n     We arrived at our reserved hotel accommodation and it was in the\
  \ evening.  By the next day we drove for hours, it was summer so when we get to\
  \ the Grand Canyon it has lots of tourist.  The sunset is almost fading, the place\
  \ is so huge and I can't believe seeing these things that once I had been dreaming\
  \ of.    I want to get emotional and feel and sink in the feeling but was also got\
  \ irritated by my ex's disrespect of me.  It seems like he is changing and I knew\
  \ something was off.  Then we went on a little hike along South Kaibab trail which\
  \ is part also of the place.  We bought souvenirs, jump back in to the free tour\
  \ bus going to the car park and it was already dark.\n     Driving back to the hotel\
  \ was a very long way of darkness and I felt goosebumps, we saw a fox and we think\
  \ we hit a rabbit.  The next day after lunch we hurriedly drive our way going to\
  \ Antelope Cave, we passed Page, Arizona.  Once we get there, we have to book for\
  \ a jeepney ride going to that cave.  We are late  and all store agencies we went\
  \ to are already fully booked so we are on the waiting list.  Luckily a couple didn't\
  \ show up so we took that spot. We jumped in to the jeep with other tourist and\
  \ a tourist guide.  The way going Antelope cave is a bumpy one for we were passing\
  \ a bumpy, sandy desert, it was a fun ride though.  \n     We were already late\
  \ to capture a good picture of the insides; angle/wave of the  cave.  The sun is\
  \ already setting and also it's like a 30 minute only tour; a 20 minute tourist\
  \ guide's explanation of the cave's history, etc. and a 10 minute of sightseeing\
  \ so I guessed.  It was a full-packed of tourist inside, rush picture takings and\
  \ we have little time to really savour the moment.  The cave is not really that\
  \ big but we're grateful we had been there on that day and no need to come back\
  \ tomorrow since already accomplished something in that day.\n     After that I\
  \ discovered that Horseshoe Bend is just nearby.  So we went there and of course\
  \ it's summer and there's a lot of people.  We have to hike for awhile in a desert\
  \ until we reached it.  It's a frightening to come to the edge of the bend but I\
  \ manage to pose closer to it.  My ex is full of energy climbing the rocks while\
  \ I'm scared to go further, I even feel tired.  \n\nNight time came and the atmosphere\
  \ was romantic, people were already leaving but some couple stay.  Me and my partner\
  \ wanted to do some intimacy \nbut I have this morbid imagination of foxes and us\
  \ getting robbed or killed so I told him we should leave.  \n\nThe next day we left\
  \ our hotel and we passed a signage going to LA or Las Vegas and we choose the latter.\
  \  It's not on our plan but we glad we took that way for we had seen the Hoover\
  \ dam as well experienced  the Vegas night.  although me and my ex are not together\
  \ anymore I don't regret the happy times I had with him.  I'm grateful and thankful\
  \ for that once in a lifetime trip and experienced that was once I had been dreaming\
  \ about.  I hope and pray that I will get this scholarship.  For me to visit another\
  \ country and share it's wonder to the world."
