Text: "I lingered as the sun drenched my face on a crispy September morning, it\u2019\
  s my first time on a plane. I giggle as I run that thought through my head. Travelling\
  \ is luxury in the place where I come from, but what do they know? I\u2019ve worked\
  \ all summer to afford this ticket, I\u2019m 17, and I\u2019m on my own. Was I trying\
  \ to imitate the clich\xE9 idea of finding your bigger purpose through travelling\
  \ perhaps?\nTouchdown, I gasp all the air into my lungs, I whisper to myself: \u201C\
  you\u2019re here to help\u201D. The sand swiftly through a breeze swept off my headscarf,\
  \ interrupted by her hazel eyes, a girl, lifted her tiny toes out of her worn out\
  \ flip flops to reach out and fix it. \u201CYour hair is showing\u201D, she uttered\
  \ those words as she gave me a nod. I didn\u2019t feel foreign to her, the nod was\
  \ a form of acceptance, was it because I was wearing something she doesn\u2019t\
  \ find too strange? Maybe she\u2019s the only one that does, my campaign friends\
  \ think I\u2019m just oppressed and forced to cover myself which doesn\u2019t make\
  \ me capable of doing things, but here we are, all, trying to make a difference\
  \ in the lives of people whom lost their home, doesn\u2019t that count for something\
  \ that you can maybe judge me for? \nI couldn\u2019t resist but embrace my love\
  \ for her sweetness, in the midst of trying to initiate a conversation, I was interrupted\
  \ by the need to start with moving the supplies we got for people. I greeted her\
  \ a good bye and left off to continue what I came for. As I helped out with carrying\
  \ down the boxes from the truck, I skimmed through the place. It\u2019s not a dream\
  \ destination, it is Turkey, but not the glamorous part, where you munch on baklavas\
  \ by the Bosphorus, however, the deserted part, where the Syrians who left their\
  \ homelands, found refuge in it, the border of the country, where you\u2019ll find\
  \ people seeking.\nMy first encounter was a family of ten children, I tried to invest\
  \ in my smiling skills as I got to know each of them, people take refuge in smiles,\
  \ they search for hope in faces. I wondered how they were able to have such a big\
  \ family in times of war, but I never questioned it, until the mother looked me\
  \ in the eye as I was scanning the beautiful faces of her children as if I had it\
  \ written on my forehead, and she explained:\u201D My daughter, with every one of\
  \ them comes a blessing\u201D. She continues to tell me:\u201D Ahmad, my 3 months\
  \ old was born the day we got here, he was the reason God eased the path for us.\u201D\
  \ The father then continued to say:\u201D we never had a day that we didn\u2019\
  t have food on our plates, I try to work with all of my potential so that we don\u2019\
  t need the help of those who displaced us in the first place\u201D. \nI scan through\
  \ their faces, tired eyes that long to belong, somewhere where they don\u2019t feel\
  \ rejected, where they sense security, for once. As I try to think through what\
  \ I\u2019ll be living in for the next week, I think to myself, these are the granddaughters\
  \ and sons of the refugees they weren\u2019t able to burn! What could be more powerful\
  \ than realizing that you descend from fighting ancestors? That weakness can empower\
  \ you.\nThe little girl approached me again, just as the sun was bowing down, she\
  \ held a tie in her hand, so I ran my hands across her sun soaked golden hair and\
  \ as I braided it, she said:\u201D Let me tell you how I can see the whole world\
  \ when I close my eyes.\u201D"
