Text: "I am not brave when It comes to travelling. Having grown up in an overprotected\
  \ family in Greece as an only child. I didn\u2019t take the bus to downtown Athens\
  \ by myself before I was 18. Asia was out of the question. Too far, too dangerous,\
  \ too \u2026 different!\nGoing to Indonesia, was not possible to imagine for my\
  \ parents. But I had a classmate who invited me, and it finally seemed feasible.\
  \ If I have a local connection, I will not feel so lost and scared, I thought.\n\
  How old am I in this trip? In my 30s, a young adult in Europe, but I could be a\
  \ grandmother in other parts of the world.\nI land in Jakarta mid-August with high\
  \ temperature and humidity. My classmate\u2019s family picks me up at the airport\
  \ and I try to grasp as many images as possible through the window, as the car slows\
  \ down in the traffic. Modern buildings and highways, villas and slums.\nMy friend\
  \ lives with her family in a wealthy part of the city. They are welcoming and I\
  \ almost feel at ease.\nTomorrow I have some business and I asked my younger sister\
  \ to accompany you around the city, my classmate tells me. I feel grateful and reassured.\n\
  My friend\u2019s sister arrives the next morning and I ask her for suggestions.\n\
  I know where we should go, she tells me: to the old harbour, so that you discover\
  \ the different faces of the city.\nWe take the tube, we take the bus, we walk.\
  \ And we arrive in the old port of Jakarta: Sunda Kelapa de Batavia.\nThere is stagnant\
  \ water, and a slum with semi-destroyed houses, constructed with anything accessible,\
  \ around it. The colour of the water is brown and the smell is not very welcoming.\
  \ Let\u2019s take a small boat and visit, the sister says. I follow her because\
  \ I don\u2019t want to seem scared or uninterested. Don\u2019t be chicken, I tell\
  \ myself, but I am afraid of falling into the water, getting who knows what infection,\
  \ despite the vaccines I had to do before travelling.\nI also don\u2019t want to\
  \ show any disrespect by demonstrating a lack of interest. I say yes, and we get\
  \ into a tiny boat that could tip with any wrong movement. We approach the slum.\
  \ I look foreign: families try anything to welcome me. They smile and wave at me.\
  \ Little children dive in to show me all they can do. They are adorable but I fear\
  \ for them and I breathe through my mouth. The water stinks.\n\_\nThey seem loving\
  \ and happy, living in the moment, despite a lack of any comfort and basic hygiene,\
  \ what we may consider extreme poverty. They touch my heart.\nWe go back and I feel\
  \ a bit embarrassed with my visit. Is it different from hundreds of years of colonizers\
  \ and their foreign curiosity?\nThe sister told me, I wanted you to see something\
  \ different.\nIt sure made a lasting impression.\nA few months later, I find myself\
  \ in the Northern part of London, towards Wood Green. My local connection is a Greek-British\
  \ friend living in a flatshare.\_ The first morning, he leaves early for work and\
  \ I find a note to join him later for lunch. His flatmate is there and offers to\
  \ show me around the neighbourhood. How about getting some coffee and familiarize\
  \ with the area? The closest place is the local pub. It isn\u2019t exactly morning,\
  \ it is midday. The pub is populated with middle-aged men, already drunk, an empty\
  \ expression in their eyes. A smell of alcohol all around. These men are numb as\
  \ if kissed by the Dementors, in a Harry Potter book. It\u2019s important you get\
  \ to see the different faces of London, my friend\u2019s flatmate said. I have a\
  \ flashback at that moment. These men are living in one of the richest cities in\
  \ the world, one of the most powerful. Individually, they might be richer than the\
  \ children in the Jakarta slum and their families.\nAnd yet, the absence of joy\
  \ is shocking."
