Text: "So this is it, this is what the other side of the world looks like. A never-ending\
  \ emerald ocean, the sound of waves crashing against rocks and golden strips of\
  \ sand nestled between white cliffs.\n\nIt\u2019s been a long ride to get here.\
  \ A day of my life spent in the clouds. It\u2019s also the furthest I have ever\
  \ been from home. From my time in college to my work days, I have always belonged\
  \ to a very local and sedentary species and never felt the need to adventure far\
  \ from the nest. My days have always followed a very careful plan, answering to\
  \ the rhythm of a daily commute and the occasional outing to the pub. \n\nI never\
  \ really knew what I wanted from life but I knew this wasn't it - so last week I\
  \ summoned the courage to quit. Because I did not want just a mild change of scenery,\
  \ my next destination needed to be as far as it can get. I decided to flee to the\
  \ other side of the world, literally. So this is my story, the story of the rural\
  \ girl from Suffolk taking over bustling Sydney. First stop in the city: Bondi beach.\n\
  \nAren\u2019t all beaches the same? Not this one. There\u2019s an element of drama\
  \ to Bondi that contrasts with the sleek and clean architecture of the city centre.\
  \ With its rugged rocks, gushing waves and powerful wind, the coastline of Bondi\
  \ is a constant reminder of how untamable nature is.\n\nFrom the clifftop, the view\
  \ is scenic and the surroundings are majestic. As I\u2019m perched there, with nothing\
  \ but water before my eyes, I slowly feel the soothing effect of the ocean on me.\
  \ I am thousands of miles from home but I have never felt closer to myself."
