Text: "In secondary phase I was selected for scholarship with the YES program to spend\
  \ \n\n\n\n\nthe academic year 2011/2012 in Texas, USA. I stayed with a host family.\
  \ Although the couple was much older than me, we developed a close friendship. By\
  \ caring for me as\ntheir daughter and introducing me to their neighbors and friends,\
  \ they truly made me feel as though I was at my Egyptian home.\nAlso, they demonstrated\
  \ respect toward my religion. For example, my host father helped me in finding the\
  \ website of the closest mosque so\nthat I could follow the five daily times of\
  \ prayer. Another special thing occurred during the time of Ramadan. Repeatedly,\
  \ my host mother would awake during the night to prepare a special breakfast (el\
  \ sohor) before waking me up to get ready for fasting and school. In return, I went\
  \ many times to church with my host family in order to make new friends and to show\
  \ that, in Egypt, we respect each other no matter the belief.\nMy host mother was\
  \ blind as well. She showed me how to do house\nwork, printed my school materials\
  \ in Braille, and studied along with me.\n I joined public school. It was my first\
  \ time experiencing a school for sighted students, and it was their first time to\
  \ receive a blind student, thus creating challenges on both sides.  Fortunately,\
  \ I learned about an organization for special education that helps students with\
  \ disabilities improve their personal and academic skills. \nThey connected me with\
  \ the light house for the blind where they provided me with a lot of training opportunities\
  \ such as technology classes, playing golf, customer service, and mobility classes\
  \ (white cane). After noticing my interest in media, they insisted on arranging\
  \ a training program with a TV channel in order for me to learn more about the production\
  \ process of the new sessions. I also received training at a newspaper where I learned\
  \ how to write articles. At the end of the training, they surprised me by publishing\
  \ an article about me in the Tyler paper. \nThe YES program also provided me the\
  \ opportunity to join another organization called Mobility international USA (MIUSA).\
  \ MIUSA allowed me to experience a greater level of challenge, where members had\
  \ to learn to interact with different types of disabilities and communicate with\
  \ each other in creative ways. It was designed to challenge you!  For example: after\
  \ being paired with a specific disability, one must figure out how to best communicate\
  \ with a person with this different disability. We played several games to facilitate\
  \ the opportunity to try this. It was challenging but fun.\n\tWe met again at the\
  \ end of the year where we had other workshops and meetings about disability rights\
  \ and how American law protects them. I also remember that we went to the University\
  \ of Oregon to learn about how students with disabilities obtain the material and\
  \ how they solve any problem they face in their classes. Lastly, with MIUSA we went\
  \ to volunteer for gardening. Although the weather was cold, the satisfaction for\
  \ accomplishing something like this has warmed us.\nWhen I returned to Egypt, my\
  \ school selected me to manage the student\xB4s union. I tried to share with the\
  \ students what I learned in the USA, such as technology and the English language.\n\
  Yet, that was what  I didn\u2019t expect to find\u2019"
