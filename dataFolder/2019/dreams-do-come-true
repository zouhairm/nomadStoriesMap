Text: "Last spring I took a great leap of faith into the unknown. It was the most\
  \ exciting and amazing experience that I have had thus far in my lifetime. I traveled\
  \ overseas for the first time in my entire life. I divorced my dear spouse several\
  \ years earlier, after extreme emotional and verbal abuse. Sometimes even physical.\
  \ The battle was tremendously painful. I fought to take care of my children, as\
  \ a mother with a very low paying job. I decided that year to treat myself to vacation.\
  \ I did not know how I was going to pay for it. I was able to use part of my tax\
  \ money to pay for my plane ticket and I made payments on the trip. I was finally\
  \ living one of my dreams for my life! To be able to see another part of the world!\
  \ The island was immaculate. The people were so cordial and beautiful! I soaked\
  \ up the equatorial sun each and everyday with my skin! I drank the fun & fruity\
  \ drinks with extreme contentment. And I admired the humble but rare people of the\
  \ lands. I saw the love of my life too. It was something I will never, ever forget!\
  \ I know that one trip added to the strength & joy that I needed to continue my\
  \ journey in this thing called life! I do not believe I would have endured without\
  \ it! I look forward to my next journey to travel. When and where, I am not sure.\
  \ I am still making a new life for my children and I. I lost everything. So am I\
  \ still rebuilding. But I know the importance of taking time out to care for myself\
  \ and that o deserve it! I hope this trip giveaway can provide me another opportunity\
  \ to travel and keep the flame of hope high in my life! That\u2019s what traveling\
  \ does! It keeps your spirit alive!! Thank you for the opportunity to tell my story\
  \ and why traveling is so important!"
