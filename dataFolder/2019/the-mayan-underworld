Text: "Wandering out of my hostel dorm room, I did a quick scan of the courtyard in\
  \ search of some breakfast.  I grabbed a coffee, and sat quietly by myself, wondering\
  \ what I would do with my first day in Tulum.  There was a beach nearby, some ancient\
  \ ruins, and several limestone sinkholes called \"cenotes\" that were said to be\
  \ crystal clear.  Lost in my own thoughts, I was soon approached by a friendly local\
  \ around my age.  He wanted to take a group into the jungle for an inside look at\
  \ authentic Mayan life, as well as a tour of an elaborate cave system with underground\
  \ cenotes.  Without a second thought, I jetted back to my room to pack a day bag\
  \ and jumped in the car with Alexandro, a German couple, and a Brit, and off we\
  \ went.  \n\nWindows down, we sped through the jungle in Alexandro's modest, un-airconditioned\
  \ car until we reached a small house accompanied by a roadside stand of handmade\
  \ crafts and art.  Alexandro knew the family living there and agreed to bring people\
  \ by to look at their trinkets in exchange for allowing us to visit with their animals.\
  \  Among the many animals were alpacas, hogs, chickens, and a little spider monkey\
  \ named Natasha, who we were told was found abandoned in the jungle.  Natasha was\
  \ undoubtedly the star of the show, and her feisty attitude came out immediately.\
  \  The second I turned my head to pet an animal, or speak with someone, she was\
  \ in my bag seeking out the sandwich I had brought for lunch.  Giving in, I offered\
  \ her some of my apple, and we became friends.  As I tried to capture the moments\
  \ on camera, she became extra fond of my bright pink hair.  Alex joked that the\
  \ color  reminded her of a dragon fruit, earning me the nickname \u201Cpitaya\u201D\
  \ for the rest of the trip.\n\t\nWe said goodbye and carried on our way to a small\
  \ village.  Here we met another family, and several more animals.  They showed us\
  \ around their homes, and we climbed a very high, very questionable tower that overlooked\
  \ the whole village and the surrounding jungle.  We retreated into the jungle on\
  \ foot for a short hike before reaching the cave entrance.  A man from the village\
  \ provided harnesses and ropes to repel into the narrow opening of the cave.  One\
  \ by one, we descended into the cave, which opened up into a large cavern.  Looking\
  \ up, we could see a massive root system that encompassed one entire wall.  It was\
  \ such a surreal feeling to view the world from this angle.  We explored several\
  \ different chambers of various sizes, some connected only by small tunnels.  Stalactites\
  \ and stalagmites grew from both ends of the cave, and bats fluttered around our\
  \ heads.  Finally we reached a large opening.  The striped walls displayed layers\
  \ of the cave's history, and below, the clearest turquoise waters I have ever seen.\
  \  Although it was relatively cold in the cave, we had been climbing and crawling\
  \ for almost an hour, and the cool, crisp water was quite refreshing.  \n\nAfter\
  \ a quick dip, we continued through the cave, passing what was once an area designated\
  \ for worship by Mayans long ago.  Shamans would perform rituals here, believing\
  \ that this was the entrance to Hell.  Ultimately we reached a wooden staircase\
  \ that led us back to the world above.  Trekking back towards the village, we were\
  \ hit with the smell of fresh-cooked fish wafting through the air.  As we ate our\
  \ fried fish and masa tortillas, we were greeted by the many animals roaming the\
  \ property.  I slipped a few pieces to a mangy white puppy aptly named Blanca. \
  \ I badly wanted to put her in my bag and take her home, but I begrudgingly resisted.\
  \  I quickly finished my food, more interested in gawking at all of the animals.\
  \  I managed to find the tiniest of turtles, some parrots, and a brood of chicks\
  \ scurrying after a surrogate turkey.  Eventually, the group managed to peel me\
  \ away from the critters and with the sun quickly setting, we made our way back\
  \ to the world that we had escaped for the day."
