Text: "Suzie is sitting completely naked with her hands joined inside her thighs,\
  \ sandwiched between a couple who is busy feeling her up. I am sitting in the aisle\
  \ row opposite Suzie\u2019s, inside Suzie Wong a go-go bar in the popular red light\
  \ district Soi Cowboy of Bangkok. There are three rows in the bar; the middle row\
  \ has a table the bar\u2019s length on which there are adult dancers entertaining\
  \ bar guests as they sip their drinks. It is difficult to watch Suzie and her patrons;\
  \ it has made me very uncomfortable. \n\nI am in Thailand with my three friends;\
  \ we are on a bachelorette trip. I work as a research analyst, frequently conducting\
  \ interviews and hosting conferences. The senior management, consisting only men,\
  \ is convinced that pretty faces tease out more answers during Q&A and increase\
  \ attendance at events.\n\n\u2018I intend to begin the search for a new job after\
  \ finishing this trip\u2019, I tell my friend, as we step out of Suzie Wong.\n\n\
  When we stop at a souvenir shop, I see an iron ashtray with a woman\u2019s body\
  \ carved on its edges, like a soap dish designed as a bathtub. The woman\u2019s\
  \ legs are carved in detail along the ashtray\u2019s edge, creating an image of\
  \ a woman spreading her legs wide. As the idea of ashtray\u2019s design dawns upon\
  \ me, I feel a pit in my stomach.\n\nOne is essentially stubbing the cigarette in\
  \ her vagina.\n\n\u2018It is sadistic objectification of women. Selling and buying\
  \ this souvenir, to be placed in our living rooms is propagating this objectification,\
  \ accepting it and normalizing it.\u2019 I say it out loud. It is an image that\
  \ I cannot unsee.\n\nI have just now realized my experience at Suzie Wong. The problem\
  \ is not the sex industry; prostitution is work like any other. Suzie, when I saw\
  \ her was not in charge of her job. She was sitting there mute while things happened\
  \ to her.\n\nIn that sense, we are the same, Suzie and I. We both, and millions\
  \ of other women, are being objectified at work. It is respect that we deserve at\
  \ our workplace, and not to settle for anything less than that. We are more than\
  \ just our pretty faces.\n\n\u2018I want to resign from my job immediately\u2019\
  ; I tell my friend as our flight is ready to take-off from Bangkok and we are the\
  \ only four females on this full flight that seats 180 passengers."
