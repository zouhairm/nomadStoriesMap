Text: "\u201CAre you sure we haven\u2019t accidentally crossed the country?\u201D\
  \ this must have been the third time I had asked that question and the answer remained\
  \ the same: \u201CNo love, we haven\u2019t!\u201D \n\nI kept looking around, amazed\
  \ at what I was seeing, in total disbelief of the scenery before me. I must have\
  \ fallen asleep and we had somehow crossed the border and here I was now, in this\
  \ tropical place filled with palm trees and colourful houses. \nMozambique, we must\
  \ be in Mozambique, I repeated to myself. I kept dismissing the obvious signs that\
  \ we were indeed still in South Africa; the road signs, licence plates, the ads\
  \ on billboards, etc. it just didn\u2019t make sense though\u2026 we were on our\
  \ way to Thohoyando in Limpopo and my expectation of the place was nothing compared\
  \ to what I was seeing at that moment: green, lush, colourful, rich. I wanted to\
  \ get out of the car and touch something, to make sure it was real. \n\nIn South\
  \ African we basically have three overly populated main cities and a handful of\
  \ prominent towns; everything else is considered \u2018homelands\u2019 and those\
  \ of us who hail from the major hubs have a morphed perception of these areas, more\
  \ so if those \u2018deserted\u2019 places aren\u2019t coastal towns.  \nThe assumption\
  \ is that it is all bushveld, tin shack houses and areas where the majority live\
  \ in poverty.  However, this was far from what my bourgeois-self expected to see.\
  \ \n\nHills and mountains covered in fruit trees and verdant grass. Pink, purple\
  \ and yellow houses randomly erected in this sea of green; not a single shack built\
  \ from tin and scrap material in sight, these were three-bedroom homes and we could\
  \ feel a sense of community as we were driving past. Groups of school children in\
  \ their blue uniforms walking each other home, the little convenience stores covered\
  \ in coca cola adverts, the grannies sitting in front of their homes just watching\
  \ people go by and of course, the mandatory roaming dog.  \n \nAs we drove through\
  \ these rich hills, we could admire a tea plantation in the distance and from time\
  \ to time, got to have magnificent views of one of South Africa\u2019s sacred sites,\
  \ Lake Funduzi. This magical lake is said to be home to a giant python and a white\
  \ crocodile; it also has a strict policy forbidding anyone to swim in it, unless\
  \ they have special authorisation from the royal chiefdom which governs the region.\
  \ \n\nThoyohando is surrounded by so much natural beauty and mysticism, it is hard\
  \ not to fall in love with it. It is a place which leaves you wondering, and which\
  \ awakens your sense of curiosity. \n\nThis breath-taking region is a gentle reminder\
  \ of the all the hidden beauty that this country possesses; it is also a reminder\
  \ that the things that leave a long-lasting impact on you are often the beautiful\
  \ thing you don\u2019t expect to find."
