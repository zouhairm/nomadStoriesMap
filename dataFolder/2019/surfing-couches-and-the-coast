Text: "The first time I went surfing was in Rekjavik in 2012.  It was bitterly cold;\
  \ the wind numbed our faces and tore at our clothes. My friend and I navigated our\
  \ surroundings deftly that day, bobbing and weaving until we reached our destination:\
  \ a simple brick structure just outside the main street, Laugavegur.  It was the\
  \ dormitory of our couchsurfing host.  \n\nNils, a German study abroad student at\
  \ the University of Reykjavik, was tall and lanky with an inviting smile and a mischievous\
  \ glint in his eye.  He had agreed to put us up for the night during the country\u2019\
  s biggest music festival, Iceland Airwaves.  Instead of a board, we had a mattress\
  \ on the floor.  Instead of the surf, we battled the waves of people who flocked\
  \ to the numerous venues across the city. \n\nAccommodation had been a commodity\
  \ and we were one unanswered couchsurfing request away from sleeping at the bus\
  \ station.  To show our appreciation for Nils\u2019 hospitality, we took him out\
  \ on the town to small, steaming bars packed wall-to-wall, picking up new friends\
  \ along the way.  Our group grew from three to six.  \u201CMore people, more party,\u201D\
  \ Nils said as we all toasted our drinks to the sounds of an Icelandic death metal\
  \ band that raged in the background.\n\nIt was my first time staying in a stranger\u2019\
  s home but it would not be my last.  In December of 2014, I spent 20 days traveling\
  \ aimlessly across Ireland.  Near the close of my trip, a request to stay with a\
  \ host on the west coast was approved.  Lahinch, a small village in County Clare,\
  \ is renowned for its beach town vibe.  My host, Chris, gave me the green light\
  \ to come on New Year\u2019s Eve and told me there would be a party.\n\nHe gave\
  \ me a simple address: the house was on Station Road.  There was no house number,\
  \ he said.  I would know I was there when I saw the barn with the cow.  Across the\
  \ street would be a house with a white van in the drive.  I had never heard of houses\
  \ without numbers.  How did they get their mail?  Deeming my own question foolish,\
  \ I kept it to myself.  The directions seemed straightforward enough to me.  Before\
  \ I set off on the bus from Galway, I drew myself a crude map in my notebook.\n\n\
  Alighting the coach at the stop in Lahinch, I realized it wouldn\u2019t take me\
  \ long to get my bearings.  There was one road that served as both entrance and\
  \ exit.  The space in between those two points was compact and consisted of a handful\
  \ of pubs, a chipper, and a couple hotels.  Even for someone as directionally challenged\
  \ as myself, navigating was decidedly fool proof.\n\nWithin minutes, I found my\
  \ way onto Station Road.  It was a miserable evening: the darkening sky spit a light\
  \ rain that cast an inhospitable haze on the surroundings.  Soon, I approached a\
  \ wooden structure resembling a small barn.  Inside, a lone cow peered out curiously\
  \ at me.  I turned to face the houses opposite and sure enough, there was the one\
  \ with the white van.\n\nOnce inside, I quickly discovered that I was not alone.\
  \  Chris had approved the requests of a few others.  Seven others.  But instead\
  \ of being uncomfortable, conversations sprang up instantly among the group of strangers.\
  \  Talking with one of Chris\u2019 housemates, Jen, I learned she was a member of\
  \ the women\u2019s Scottish national surfing team.  She offered me a free lesson\
  \ and I enthusiastically accepted.\n\nAfter the craziness of the New Year came and\
  \ went, I found myself on the shore, shivering in a damp wet suit alongside Chris,\
  \ Jen, and a German couchsurfer, Katharina.  We ran through a quick tutorial of\
  \ the basics then she cut us loose.  The waves were strong and the frigid temperature\
  \ jolting, but for an hour we braved the surf.\n\nSitting around on our boards,\
  \ staring at the endless ocean, I threw out a question that broke the silence.\n\
  \n\u201CHow do you get your mail if you don\u2019t have a house number?\u201D I\
  \ asked.\n\n\u201CThe mailman just knows,\u201D was Chris\u2019 obvious response."
