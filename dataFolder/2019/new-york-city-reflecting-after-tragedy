Text: "New York City is a must stop destination for anyone travelling to the good\
  \ ole US of A. \n   An iconic world city, a vibrant epicentre of culture, finance\
  \ and sports. It is home of the Yankees, The Statue of Liberty, Times Square, The\
  \ Empire State Building and so much more. The city that never sleeps certainly lives\
  \ up to that mantra. \n   I only had three days to see everything that I possibly\
  \ could, it was the middle of January so I prayed that the weather would be kind.\n\
  \   The days averaged -1C (30F), that\u2019s cold for an Aussie but it didn\u2019\
  t bother the locals so I wasn\u2019t going to let it stop me either. Multiple layers\
  \ of clothing and the pure excitement of visiting the Big Apple would be enough\
  \ to protect me from the elements. \n   I caught a tourist bus to see the sights,\
  \ an onboard guide pointing out places of interest while providing interesting facts\
  \ and local history. As we ventured through Lower Manhattan my jovial mood became\
  \ a little sombre. The bus was approaching the site of the World Trade Centre, a\
  \ place that was violently shoved into infamy on September 11th 2001, a day that\
  \ the world and this city changed forever.    \n   I knew when planning my trip\
  \ to NY that this was a must visit destination, I wanted to pay my respects to the\
  \ victims of this tragedy, the 2,977 innocent people who died that day in addition\
  \ to more than 6,000 people who were injured including many brave and heroic first\
  \ responders. I knew that it was going to be an emotional stop but I wasn\u2019\
  t prepared for just how much it would affect me.\n   A little over seven years had\
  \ passed since that heartbreaking day. When I arrived at the World Trade Centre\
  \ site, I discovered it was bordered by a large blue fence featuring concept designs\
  \ for a new building and memorial. A new building of futuristic design that would\
  \ replace the two iconic towers, towers that had been an easily recognisable part\
  \ of the New York City skyline since the 1970\u2019s.  \n   I stood on Vesey St\
  \ behind the fence listening to the simultaneous sounds of construction and demolition\
  \ as the background noise of New York City seemed to fade away. As I silently payed\
  \ my own small tribute to the victims of that day I looked up into the overcast\
  \ sky, imagined the twin towers still standing in place. The cloudy grey skies were\
  \ replaced by a bright and sunny Fall morning as those memories came flooding back\
  \ to me. I was momentarily transported back to that morning, a plane appears, seemingly\
  \ out of nowhere before disappearing into the building, a fireball erupting out\
  \ of the hole it created.\n   That was the first image I saw when I turned the television\
  \ on that morning, at first, I thought it was footage from an upcoming Hollywood\
  \ blockbuster but that illusion was soon to be shattered. I continued to watch from\
  \ half a world away over the next several days and weeks as new information came\
  \ in, as yet unable to fully understand the consequences of the terrorist attack.\
  \ \n   As I stood there continuing to gaze skyward, a lady in business attire with\
  \ kind blue eyes and genuine smile tapped me on the shoulder breaking my train of\
  \ thought. \n    \u201CWe New Yorkers are strong and resilient. Remember the past\
  \ but don\u2019t dwell on it. Focus on the future.\u201D She said briefly gazing\
  \ skyward high above the blue fencing. It became apparent to me that she had seen\
  \ the emotions play across my face as I looked up and knew exactly what I was thinking.\
  \  \n  I had heard stories that New Yorkers were tough, hard to please bordering\
  \ on rude but that\u2019s not what I experienced, not this version of New York.\
  \ This lady who never told me her name embodied the new spirit of the city. It had\
  \ become a place that had turned its grief into a new zest for life determined not\
  \ to be beaten. \n   I hope to return to NY in the near future to see the completed\
  \ tower and memorial while reconnecting with this timeless, futuristic city once\
  \ again."
