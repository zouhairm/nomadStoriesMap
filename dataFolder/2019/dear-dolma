Text: "I never told you the day I arrived at your house was the day I turned 23. That\
  \ morning after a lazy breakfast I bought a ticket for Hemis Shukpachan. The bus\
  \ was bustling with local music blaring amidst Julley greetings by ecstatic Ladakhis\
  \ who were returning back after attending His Holiness the Dalai Lama\u2019s teachings\
  \ in Leh. Watching the flat round faces of the villagers with short thick noses,\
  \ wide cheekbones and a language akin more to Tibet than of India. I felt lost in\
  \ translation in my own country. Being the only clueless traveller who kept wheezing\
  \ due to the high altitude. I felt a strange sense of exhilaration when the bus\
  \ dropped me off at a quaint little hamlet. As I searched for a homestay little\
  \ did I know that your village was a close contender for the mythical Shangri-La!\
  \ Defying its surrounding with its green carpet in a valley of brown boulders and\
  \ rugged mountains in Western Ladakh, India.\_\n\nNever having been inside an old-style\
  \ Ladakhi house before I couldn\u2019t help but be fascinated with the insides of\
  \ your kitchen while sipping on my butter tea. Starting with the entire wall behind\
  \ the stove that gleamed with cookware, burnished and stacked on shelves. Nothing\
  \ remained hidden away in drawers or cupboards. The hand-painted wooden flour canister,\
  \ jars of spices, enormous hand-hewn pots and pans, flanked by towers of porcelain\
  \ cups and not to forget the brightly coloured thermoses lined up in order of height\
  \ in the lowest shelf next to the eating area. The aesthetics of a traditional Ladakhi\
  \ life was evident in the way you had arranged it all. \n\n\u201CShe lives here\
  \ alone with her four cats while my father and I work in the city.\u201D said your\
  \ daughter who spoke little English. \u201CWhat are the cats\u2019 names?\u201D\
  \ I asked. Your daughter smiled and replied, \u201CThey have no names. But respond\
  \ only to sounds made by my mother.\u201D At first, I found it strange but when\
  \ I saw you with them I understood how language becomes obsolete when we step in\
  \ the realm of love. You were the kind old cat lady. \n\nYour deep pensive eyes\
  \ spoke more than your daughter\u2019s translated words. They told me you were not\
  \ satisfied with our small talk. Craving to hear more than just sounds of cat mews\
  \ in your house. But all you could manage was saying ''Ya ya ya!''. Which I'm assuming\
  \ you picked up from an American who stayed here in the past. \n\nAt night when\
  \ I found an old photo album in my room, I knew it was my turn for craving more.\
  \ Hoping those moments frozen in time would tell me your story that you couldn\u2019\
  t yourself. That night I time travelled through your photographs. You were once\
  \ a beautiful young lady who loved getting her pictures taken. Over the years not\
  \ much has changed. Neither the kitchen nor you or the cats. Photos of family gatherings,\
  \ village weddings and women spinning yak wool in meadows showed me the age-old-way\
  \ of life of the Ladakhi culture in this remote corner of the Indian trans-Himalayas.\
  \ That is slowly fading due to the explosion of modern day tourism. \n\nNext morning\
  \ as we sat silently stemming spinach in your courtyard my mind kept going back\
  \ to that photo album. I understood now why you seemed so eager to know how long\
  \ I was staying & whether I liked the traditional skyu you cooked for me. I know\
  \ this because your photos showed me how you loved hosting and meeting new people\
  \ despite the language barrier.  \n\nI wish I could have stayed longer. I wish I\
  \ could tell you how fortunate I was for spending my birthday at your home. I distinctly\
  \ remember how those brown solemn eyes would light up meeting your weatherworn cheekbones\
  \ whilst you smiled and I knew you needed no translation as I took out my camera.\
  \ Our silent connection taught me how that which cannot be put into words can only\
  \ be grasped through silence sometimes. Or as Ansel Adam rightly said, \u201CWhen\
  \ words become unclear, I shall focus with photographs. When images become inadequate,\
  \ I shall be content with silence.\u201D"
