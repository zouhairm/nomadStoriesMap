Text: "On the night of 2 May 2018, she landed at the airport in Lisbon, the beautiful\
  \ Portuguese capital. She had last been on the sidewalks of the city a year and\
  \ a couple of months ago. During that time she had been through a lot of things\
  \ and changed a lot:\n\n\"How nice to see the same things with different eyes,\"\
  \ she thought.\n\nThe desire to return matured in her for a long time, yet the decision\
  \ to fly to Lisbon she took determined and spontaneous. She bought the ticket almost\
  \ as soon as the sun rose - she tried to make sure that all this was not emotional\
  \ and more rational. She was really excited and decided to keep the trip a secret\
  \ so far.\n\nShe still shared her parents just before she left. At least she thought\
  \ her mother would have told her. She really needed to run away.\n\nIn the last\
  \ week before his departure, there was still room to sleep - the trip coincided\
  \ with the Eurovision Song Contest, and all the rooms in the city were reserved.\
  \ This in no way disturbed her because she knew that magic was happening in this\
  \ country. Perhaps he even preferred it to be so.\n\nShe happened to be at the train\
  \ ticket machine ...\n\n\"Desculpe, podes ajudar-me com os bilhetes a comboio?\"\
  \ Asked a swarthy man: she thought he was asking her how the machine worked and\
  \ he just asked her 2 euros ... how kindly on his side ... Get on the train almost\
  \ in the last minute:\n\n\u201C16:20 - as always, the king is on schedule. I wonder\
  \ where the illusion of the Portuguese is coming from is that the Portuguese are\
  \ a late nation ... their transport network is uncomfortably accurate and moves\
  \ on schedule, and all the Portuguese I know arrive at the place quite a while ...\
  \ certainly ahead of me!\u201D\n\n\nSantos, Bel\xE9m, Carcavelos, Estoril ... views\
  \ one of the most picturesque: palms, sands, tourists on the beaches of the Lisbon\
  \ coastline ... The train stopped on Estoril. She felt her excitement quieten, and\
  \ she swam more and more slowly through the depths of her soul. Her eyes widened,\
  \ and she got that childish look on her face.\n\nShe was in love again and the lover\
  \ was the way again ... he had called to meet her by the ocean.\n\n***\n\nShe went\
  \ to the station in Cascais, where her classmate met her. They took pictures of\
  \ the beach, strolled along the paved sidewalks on the city's secluded street, and\
  \ finally drank cocktails on a terrace.\n\n- Where are you going to sleep tonight?\n\
  - I have no idea, everything is reserved for the Eurovision.\n- I will call my landlord\
  \ to warn him that you will come home.\n\u201CWow... this journey starts luckily!\u201D\
  \ ... - she thought."
