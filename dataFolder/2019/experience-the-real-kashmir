Text: Kashmir a real paradise... A solo traveller willing to get lost in d solitude  n
  explore life or a photo enthusiast looking to capture nature's best serenity, a
  couple trying to experience d breath of love in open air in a movie style or a family
  get together... Kashmir is a vacation gift.. The colourfully decked heritage boat
  in d Dal lake, sitting in d deck n taking d photographs of d beautiful mountain
  at d edge of Lake, glimpses of locals selling jewelleries, Maggi n beverages in
  floating market n chit chat with the locals, specially d doll faced kids is an out
  of box experience.I am a big time  foodie..and I loved every bit of mouthwatering
  Rogan gosh, Modur pulau, Goshtaba, Yakhni n Dum olav..The best thing I like about
  my trip is my interaction with the local driver a Kashmir guy in his mid 20's his
  welcome n warm attitude, his guiding to places while I explored Srinagar n Pahalgam,
  he accompanying us in treks... making me interact wt other locals..everythg is worth
  praisable..Waking up in morning n heading to Lal chow in morning fr a morning tea
  watchg d locals reading Newspapers, d iew of all time beautiful Lidder vallet n
  Betaab Valley  covered with snow covered mountains... N best part I witnessed d
  devotees going up n coming back from Amarnath temple through d rough mountain patches
  on horses back. Eating some local hot jalebis n sipping tea in d  cold... Kept me
  warm..
