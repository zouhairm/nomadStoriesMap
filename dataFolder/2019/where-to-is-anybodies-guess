Text: "I travelled like normal people to Hong Kong and then booked and paid for a\
  \ tour for me and my government prescribed holiday guide who was to meet me in Tibet,\
  \ that is, occupied China.\n\nBut the trek that was to unfold was far from \u201C\
  normal\u201D on the scale of one to ten for normality it ranked pretty close to\
  \ zero. \n\nOnce I reached Lhasa train station after a 48 hour journey on the most\
  \ bizarre little train, which included roasting ducks in the space where an awful\
  \ vinyl seat had been in my luxury booked train!!!!  On the station I met a gorgeous\
  \ young man, Phuntsok my guide,  we spent a few beautiful days in old Lhasa before\
  \ we headed of to trek through Tibet by car and on foot. \n\nThe Chinese government\
  \ make all tourists have a guide. Phuntsok spoke very good English, very rare in\
  \ all rural parts of China and so found that work easy to obtain to feed his family\
  \ of 6. \n\nIt is a beautiful country, such heavenly forests with every devine colour\
  \ of autumn nuance. It was truly majestic, the eye not knowing where to study but\
  \ wide open with wonder trying to capture it all at once. \n\nArriving at our first\
  \ accomodation, a monastery on our 3 week tour, we were met by the Buddhist monk\
  \ Abbott who had no idea we were coming; it became bleedingly obvious to Phuntsok\
  \  and I that the travel agent in Hong Kong had ripped me off after the second monastery\
  \ didn\u2019t know us either. Nor did any to come but all were very sweet, we would\
  \ turn up 10 minutes before the 6 pm deluge of rain turned on as if by tap until\
  \ 6 am and off the same way.  They would not know we were coming but turned tail,\
  \ ran up many steps, put 2 monks out of warm but very poor beds- straw no sheets,\
  \ hard wood no mattress no so clean, rudimentary but very generously,  happily and\
  \ we were grateful to be warm and dry. \n\nSome places booked did not even have\
  \ a monastery or nunnery and we would show up to the spot and have to camp out in\
  \ the forest. Once a nomadic tribe of Tibetans, of about 30plus people with black\
  \ tents and riding horses saw us with nowhere to go before the rain on the tundra,\
  \ thinking \u201Cwhere to from here? \u201D. They immediately asked to share their\
  \ tent, their food and everything they had. \nThe tibetans are the most generous,\
  \ happy, spiritual and sympatico with nature people I have ever met in the world.\
  \ They will share with you anything they have and expect nothing in return. This\
  \ was one of the happiest trips I ever had. \n\nIt included many other adventures,\
  \ too many to describe at length here but stories worth the retell: including taken\
  \ to the airport at gun point on \u201CChinese National Day\u201D by Chinese soldiers\
  \ and flown to god knows where ...turned out to be Chengdu. I discovered 24hours\
  \ later after being held at the airport????\nAnd one of my most special memories\
  \ ever- bathing with 20 village women, ancient twin great grandma and great aunt\
  \ and all generations of women inbetween a day old baby girl in natural hot springs.\
  \ \nI arrived home after 3 months and thought, well where to from here ...that one\
  \ is hard to beat but I went on to la camino Santiago de compostello and it was\
  \ an 1100km cracker as well!"
