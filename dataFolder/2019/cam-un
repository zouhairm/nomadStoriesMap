Text: "The warm runny yolk of an egg, pickled vegetables, fresh herbs, spicy peppers,\
  \ and homemade bread. I\u2019d had all these ingredients together in a bahn mi back\
  \ home, but this bite was different. My first day aimlessly exploring Hanoi had\
  \ led me to Thuy\u2019s bahn mi stand.  It was discreetly tucked away in one of\
  \ the many dark concrete alleys of Vietnam. She smiled as my face lit up with genuine\
  \ pleasure when I took my first bite. Thuy took her time making the sandwich, carefully\
  \ placing each ingredient in the right place with such importance. I could feel\
  \ how much it meant to her to create the best representation of herself through\
  \ the sandwich.\n\nIt was the best bahn mi I had ever had, but that\u2019s not why\
  \ I came back the next day. And the following day. And all the subsequent days I\
  \ spent in Hanoi. I looked forward to seeing Thuy and sharing a delicious meal with\
  \ her.\n\nShe waved every time she saw me coming. She didn\u2019t speak any English\
  \ and I tried to use the few phrases I picked up while traveling through Vietnam.\
  \ I knew my accent was not great, but she always smiled and patted my shoulder at\
  \ my attempts to order in broken Vietnamese. \n\n\u201CCam-un,\u201D I thanked her.\n\
  \nI sat at the small colorful stools set up next to her stand every time I visited.\
  \ One morning, we watched the locals getting coffee before they headed to mass at\
  \ the cathedral across the street. The next day, Thuy showed me developed photos\
  \ of her children. On another evening, we helped a neighboring local pack up his\
  \ merchandise store for the day. \n\n \nBefore leaving Hanoi, I asked my friend\u2019\
  s mom to come with me to meet Thuy and translate. And of course, to try her bahn\
  \ mi.\n\n\u201CShe says this stand is her real home. She loves having it to share\
  \ her culture and joy with visitors like you,\u201D my friend\u2019s mom translated.\n\
  \n\u201CTell her she achieved her goal,\u201D I smiled.\n\nThuy and I took pictures\
  \ together and she told me to come back before my 7am bus the next day.\n\nThe next\
  \ morning, I walked over to the stand just as the sun was peeking through the sky.\
  \ Thuy had woken up at the dark hours of dawn to gather fresh ingredients and make\
  \ five sandwiches for me. I gave her all the Dong I had left and we hugged. I placed\
  \ both of my hands on my chest and smiled with teary eyes. I didn\u2019t know how\
  \ else to thank her."
