Text: "I am sitting with my backpack and thermos by the lake in the Dolomites, drinking\
  \ a hot tea with a sandwich, thinking about the meaning of life, and trying to plan\
  \ where I will go tomorrow. \nI can not be considered an experienced traveler, because\
  \ I just started writing travel pages in my book of life. My discovering the world\
  \ began just six months ago, when I decided to become a volunteer in Europe. At\
  \ that moment I did not know what to expect, because I had never been abroad before,\
  \ but I always had a passion for traveling. \nSix month ago, I first came to the\
  \ airport not to meet someone, but to fly away. When I got on the plane, I was as\
  \ excited as a child might be when he first came to an amusement park. Can you just\
  \ imagine this feeling? There are no enough words to describe the whole range of\
  \ my emotions: happiness, inspiration, excitement, and fear. Yes, fear. I was afraid\
  \ to go alone to another country, I was afraid to start a new chapter of my life,\
  \ I was afraid to change my life. It is always easier to stay in your comfort zone\
  \ and not change anything for many years, but who said that this is the best solution?\
  \ Who said that staying in your comfort zone will make you happier? Was I happy\
  \ then? I do not think so.\nI remember very well the day that divided my life between\
  \ before and after. I was sitting next to the porthole and was looking at the clouds\
  \ and the Earth with a sinking heart. Two hours later my plane took me to Italy,\
  \ and a new chapter of my life began so suddenly and unexpectedly that I  could\
  \ not even breathe. It was a strange feeling that overwhelmed my soul. I realized\
  \ that dreams came true, and I finally left my boring routine life to explore new\
  \ countries and new cultures. On the other hand, I was afraid that people would\
  \ not be able to understand me, because I did not know Italian, and my English was\
  \ not perfect. I think this is a common fear for many people who start traveling\
  \ for the first time in their lives. Yes, I am not ashamed to admit that I was full\
  \ of fears, but I believe that each of us has fear at least once in our life, but\
  \ the main goal is not to let these fears break us. I knew that I was likely to\
  \ face some difficulties, but I was determined to take a step forward and jump into\
  \ this tempting unknown.\nDuring these six months, I think I have done more than\
  \ I have done in the past 25 years. I explored the Dolomites while hiking, danced\
  \ on the main square in Venice during the Venetian carnival, ate real Neapolitan\
  \ pizza in Naples, climbed Etna Volcano in Sicily on the first day of winter, celebrated\
  \ the New Year in Milan with my new friends. I was  also in Malta, explored this\
  \ small but very beautiful country, and now I know what the paradise looks like\
  \ \u2013 it is located on the island of Gozo!\nEvery time being in a new city, in\
  \ a new country I always meet  many  interesting people, and each new meeting changes\
  \ me and my life. And I think this is one of the main advantages of traveling: making\
  \ friends from different countries that will help you learn new cultures and languages,\
  \ and experience new beautiful moments together.\nSix months ago, I took a leap\
  \ into the unknown, and this step changed my life. I was tired of the daily routine\
  \ and was looking for my happiness. And now my every new journey helps me to understand\
  \ what makes me happy. I do not know where I will be tomorrow and what I will do,\
  \ but I know for sure that I will never stop traveling. I feel that so many beautiful\
  \ places and so many interesting people are waiting for me!"
