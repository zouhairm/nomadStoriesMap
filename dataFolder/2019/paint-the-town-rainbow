Text: "I bought my ticket without even knowing where I would live when I got there.\
  \ No idea. No plan. No direction whatsoever other than the direction of 7,940 miles\
  \ around the world. I had been accepted to study in Melbourne, Australia and although\
  \ I would be traveling alone, didn\u2019t have any family or friends to greet me\
  \ when I arrived, or any connections set up for that matter, the semester was going\
  \ to start with or without me so I just had to get myself there. What I didn\u2019\
  t realize was that I was throwing myself into a country divided.\n        Once classes\
  \ began and I got a bit more comfortable commuting around, I began to branch out\
  \ and explore. It became critical for me to occupy my free time by familiarizing\
  \ myself with all of the wonders of Melbourne. I quickly fell in love with the never-ending\
  \ sea of street art and graffiti splashed on its walls and flowing throughout its\
  \ many hidden alleyways. A favorite of mine became the famous Hosier Lane, a celebrated\
  \ landmark due to its urban art, which was home to my favorite graffiti piece: Snow\
  \ White and Cinderella sharing a passionate kiss.\n        Leaving Hosier Lane,\
  \ I crossed through what had become another favorite of mine, Federation Square;\
  \ a public space for arts, culture and public events in the central business district.\
  \ Passing through on my way to Flinders Street Station, I stumbled upon big concrete\
  \ blocks lining the street all along the station. I learned that they had been installed\
  \ just a few months before due to an incident that occurred just four blocks away,\
  \ where an attacker drove from the street onto the footpath, hitting pedestrians\
  \ \u2013 injuring many and even killing some. The blocks were now being used as\
  \ anti-terror bollards, dividing the street from the footpath. But what I found\
  \ even more curious was what was written on them - \u201CVote Yes,\u201D the \u201C\
  Yes\u201D written over with, \u201CNo,\u201D only to have a \u201CW\u201D added\
  \ to ultimately read, \u201CVote Now.\u201D\n        I arrived in Australia in the\
  \ midst of its first ever Marriage Law Postal Survey that was being used to gage\
  \ support for legalizing same-sex marriage within the country. So when I stumbled\
  \ upon the opportunity to perform in a flash mob with the goal of encouraging people\
  \ to vote Yes, I jumped at the opportunity! The creator was a tattooed, bearded\
  \ man raised in a small, country town who, in his early teen years, came out to\
  \ his parents and moved to the city. At 26, I myself was still enduring the aftermath\
  \ of coming out to my family not even a year before. \n        After I registered\
  \ for the flash mob, I received news from home that the California governor had\
  \ signed a bill making California the first state to recognize non-binary as a third\
  \ gender. I was ecstatic! There were so many times that I felt so defeated and overwhelmed\
  \ with the thought of what the condition of the world had come to, especially under\
  \ a particular presidency, so hearing the news of my home state\u2019s victory struck\
  \ a chord with me and gave me hope that my host country would soon be celebrating\
  \ its own victory.\n        Our flash mob gathered incognito in Federation Square,\
  \ just down the street from Hosier Lane, and through a beautifully crafted ensemble\
  \ of pop hits, while Snow White and Cinderella remained in their loving embrace,\
  \ we performed our flash mob to the delight of a small, unsuspecting crowd.  We\
  \ had decided to perform our flash mob on the same day as the Yes Fest Rally and\
  \ March, (also a first ever event), so that we could all attend the event together\
  \ afterwards. But news of our flash mob spread like wildfire and we were quickly\
  \ invited to join the event to perform an encore in front of an audience of thousands!\
  \ \n\tAccepting the offer to study abroad in Australia, I could\u2019ve never in\
  \ my wildest dreams imagined that I would be accepted into such a loving family\
  \ in the form of a flash mob fighting for human rights. And in November, we all\
  \ gathered to dance in the streets once again, but this time, in victory."
