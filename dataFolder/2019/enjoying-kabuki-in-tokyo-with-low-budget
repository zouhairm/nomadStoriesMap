  \ one of Intangible Cultural Heritage of UNESCO. Colorful and elaborate costumes,\
  \ expressive make up, eccentric movements, also the stage with many surprising tricks\
  \ are the elements of Kabuki. Every aspects of the show, including theater\u2019\
  s components with its hi-tech stage system, the actor himself with costumes, make\
  \ up, movement, and his capability to act as the character he played, with the background\
  \ music that fits the story could create a new kind of aesthetic, atmosphere, and\
  \ strong visual effect, that\u2019s why this performing art is much enjoyable for\
  \ everyone, even if they don\u2019t understand Japanese. \n\nKabuki-za Theater is\
  \ the recommended place for the first timer audience. It\u2019s one of the biggest\
  \ Kabuki Theater in Japan, located in the glamorous shopping district in Ginza,\
  \ Tokyo. Because of its strategic location, this theater considered as the most\
  \ accessible Kabuki theater in Japan (3 minutes walk from Higashi Ginza Station\
  \ on Toei Asakusa or Hibiya Subway Line). This theater hosts Kabuki performances\
  \ almost everyday throughout the year. Ticket on the spot can be bought from ticket\
  \ box office on the second basement, ticket machine on the first and second basement,\
  \ and single-act ticket box office stands beside the theater\u2019s main gate. \
  \     \n\nOne session of Kabuki show usually consist of three or four plays with\
  \ break about 20 to 30 minutes at every intervals of the show. Kabuki-za Theater\
  \ hosts Kabuki performances in two sessions a day, day show (usually from 11.00\
  \ to 15.00) and evening show (16.00 to 20.00).  If You only want to watch one act\
  \ or play in a session, You can go for single-act ticket or hitomaku-mi, which is\
  \ available for sale about 30-60 minute before the desired act or play being performed.\
  \ This ticket can be bought on the box office besides the theater\u2019s main gate.\
  \ We can see on the box office for the exact time for single-act ticket sale time.\
  \ It\u2019s recommended for You to check on the website www.kabuki-bito.jp to see\
  \ the schedule for the play or act you desired to watch, and be present on the single-act\
  \ ticket box office about 45 minute before the performing time (it\u2019s better\
  \ if  to come earlier, because this ticket is available in limited quantity). \n\
  \nPlease note that one person only allowed to buy 1 single-act ticket. If You\u2019\
  ll enjoy the show with Your friends, then they also need to be in queue. After getting\
  \ the ticket, we need to arrive at our seat 20 minute before the show is started.\
  \ This ticket is not including any reservation of seat, so there\u2019s a possibility\
  \ for not getting a seat and watching the show by standing (only 90 seats available\
  \ for single-act, and the standing area is only limited for 60 audiences).  The\
  \ single-act audiences will enjoy the show from 4th floor and enter the auditorium\
  \ through a door beside single-act ticket box office. After make our transaction,\
  \ we will get our ticket with queue number (not seat number). After arriving at\
  \ 4th floor, we will enter the auditorium based on our queue number on the ticket.\
  \ If we get the early number, obviously we could freely choose the best seat we\
  \ want. Single-act ticket is the solution for the tourist with limited time or budget\
  \ and it\u2019s much cheaper (about 200 to 3000 yen per act) than watching the full\
  \ session of performance which can reach 20.000 yen. English headset is available\
  \ for rent if we don\u2019t understand Japanese. \n\nAs the biggest theater, Kabuki-za\
  \ does not only offer great experience in Kabuki show, there are another facilities\
  \ to enjoy here such as restaurant, gift shop, and also museum. You can buy bento\
  \ (Japanese boxed meal) from Japanese restaurant here and enjoy it inside the auditorium\
  \ (eating is allowed during the break of the show), and don\u2019t forget to get\
  \ yourself some Kabuki themed souvenir on Kobikicho Square on the basement floor.\
  \ Kabuki museum opens on the 5th floor of the Kabuki-za Tower, a  skyscrapper building\
  \ behind the theater, you could take a closer look to many properties for Kabuki\
  \ perfomance here. Kabuki-za really is a good place to make a local conection with\
  \ Japanese cultural art."
