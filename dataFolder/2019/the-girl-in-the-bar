Text: "Imagine you have a double trip to Asia and you are excited as you can possibly\
  \ be and then all of a sudden just three days before the departing date the travel\
  \ becomes a solo travel. Well of course you go for it.\n\nIt all started with a\
  \ 18 hours layover in Tokyo, which for most people would be kind of annoying and\
  \ totally insufficient time to know such a big city, but I have always liked to\
  \ think about those long stops as a sampler. If you love it then you will definitely\
  \ come back for a proper stay and if you don\u2019t then you can move it down to\
  \ an appropriate place in your travel list. Even if you cannot stay for more than\
  \ a day, make sure you eat a week\u2019s worth of unknown local delicacies and street\
  \ food. Do not waste your time sleeping, your internal clock is completely confused\
  \ right now anyway. And so I did. I walked the whole city and even ran like crazy\
  \ when the time was about to be finished. \n\nDays feel longer when you have been\
  \ to some many places and took a thousand photographs. So, after exhausting myself\
  \ I had an amazing flight sleeping all the way to Cambodia. My hotel had made arrangements\
  \ for a driver to come and pick me up so I didn\u2019t bother to print a map or\
  \ directions or even sorted out a way to have internet. Sometimes I like to go to\
  \ the unknown; I feel there will always be people who can help you if you\u2019\
  re a bit too lost, at least they do it where I come from and later on I discovered\
  \ Southeast Asia people are quite friendly as well. I arrived and there was a young\
  \ man waiting with a sign with my name on it, we went to the parking lot and there\
  \ it was, among all the cars, a small bike pulled car. \u201CWe go by Tuk tuk\u201D\
  \ he said. He gave me his number in case I needed his transport services for later.\
  \ We arrived at the hotel and I bought a fruit smoothie just outside because the\
  \ temperature was getting real hot in the early morning. The girl at the front desk\
  \ gave me some quick recommendations of the sightseeing and night bars. She also\
  \ kept complimenting my nose which was nice and funny.\n\nThat night I went to a\
  \ local bar, full of tourists, met a girl on the bar and just talked the whole night.\
  \ Next day I rented a bike to see all the temples which are spread out by a few\
  \ kilometers apart from each other. Then we met again, the girl in the bar. We saw\
  \ a couple of temples together and this time we exchanged numbers. Also, in a whole\
  \ day of temple walking in such a small town as Siem Reap you keep meeting with\
  \ the same people, so you start being friendly to those known faces, and then you\
  \ feel like you know them and get this friendly feeling and start sharing moments\
  \ together. I only stayed in Cambodia for 4 days but I made a few friends that were\
  \ interested in traveling as I was, who were as enthusiastic about life as I am.\
  \ In the end it was time to say goodbye and go to the next city. And there she was\
  \ at the airport, the girl in the bar I met the first night, taking the same plane\
  \ as I was, flying to Singapore. I didn\u2019t expect to find someone to travel\
  \ with in my last minute changed double to solo trip. Unexpected but equally amazing.\
  \ We explored the city together and we even made some adjustments to our individual\
  \ trips and went for a third city together because we had been lucky enough to run\
  \ into each other randomly, so it felt right remain together as long as we could."
