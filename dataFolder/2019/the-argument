Text: "\u201CThere is literally nothing here\u201D, moaned Josh.\nTina looked down\
  \ at the ground, disappointed. It\u2019ll be great, she\u2019d assured us, as she\
  \ bundled us out the door that morning and onto the first bus of many. Neither of\
  \ us had particularly wanted to travel for two hours to take pictures of a cliff,\
  \ but Tina is obsessed with photography, so we\u2019d agreed. A friend of hers from\
  \ back home, Tony, had promised that this fabulous cliff was the most beautiful,\
  \ aesthetic, photogenic cliff in the whole of Malta. Tina had jumped at the chance\
  \ to take more photos on her DSLR camera. Her fourth and fanciest camera yet, she\u2019\
  d spent the entire holiday scouring out places for us to visit so she could take\
  \ pictures with its advanced features.\nTo be honest, we were running out of ideas\
  \ by this stage. It felt like we\u2019d packed so many activities into the first\
  \ few days that by day five, we\u2019d seen pretty much everything there was to\
  \ see on the island. I\u2019d have been quite happy just chilling by the pool at\
  \ our apartment, but the others, I could tell, were growing restless. That\u2019\
  s why, when Tina suggested this wonderful, unspoilt, you-have-got-to-see-this-before-you-die\
  \ cliff, I\u2019d jumped at the chance to get the others doing something, give them\
  \ the stimulation they needed.\nBut now that we were finally here, the cliff just\
  \ seemed quixotic, a failed dream. Just off the main road, we\u2019d walked across\
  \ the rocky, desolate, pre-cliff area. I\u2019d stood back from the edge, whilst\
  \ my crazy friends scampered up to it and peered over.\nThe landscape was bleak,\
  \ a lengthy road stretched out before us. To the right, dusty fields of dry vegetation\
  \ extended as far as the eye could see, sun-bleached long grasses interspersed with\
  \ pale yellow bushes. To the left, a stony ground littered with sharp, grey gravel\
  \ extended about 40 feet, before the ground fell away to the open sea. The whole\
  \ place looked as if it had been lazily designed long ago by someone who cared little\
  \ for this forgotten backwater. \nDisappointed with the uniform nature of the rocky\
  \ cliffs, flat all around and without any real change in the barren landscape in\
  \ sight for miles, we were now desperately walking, trying unsuccessfully to find\
  \ something to take pictures of that was even vaguely appealing. After the trapping,\
  \ stuffy heat of the bus, walking in this heat made a definite contrast. This was\
  \ blazing, scorching heat that made you feel weak and feeble by the time you\u2019\
  d walked even a few steps. I was parched and fading rapidly, so there\u2019s no\
  \ doubt the others were too.\n\u201CThis bit looks good!\u201D I said, feigning\
  \ enthusiasm.\nIt was no different to any other part of the cliff we\u2019d walked\
  \ past. Josh rolled his eyes at me.\n\u201CI guess. Alright, look out to sea or\
  \ something\u201D, ordered Tina, perking up.\nJosh and I are well acquainted with\
  \ Tina\u2019s photo-taking process by now. She gets us to pose in various positions,\
  \ some natural, some stylised. She\u2019ll play around with different exposures,\
  \ apertures and lenses to get the best shot. Just when we think it\u2019s finally\
  \ over, with a glint in her eye, she\u2019ll whip out her phone. I swear that girl\
  \ documents everything on Snapchat. \nAfter about half an hour of posing, Tina nodded\
  \ approvingly and decided we were done. It was time to get out of here.\n\u201C\
  There\u2019s a bus stop up there\u201D, murmured Josh, clearly keen to get out of\
  \ here. \n\u201CNah mate, let\u2019s go to the one we were at before\u201D, demanded\
  \ a sorrowful Tina.\n\u201CBut this one\u2019s closer\u201D, Josh insisted, tapping\
  \ his foot agitatedly, impatient.\n\u201CYeah but no\u201D. Tina was getting rattled\
  \ now. I could tell from the stiff way in which she held herself, and the irritated\
  \ tone with which she spoke.\n\u201CGuys, it\u2019s really not a big deal, let\u2019\
  s just pick one\u201D, I said calmly.\n\u201CLet\u2019s go with Josh\u2019s one\
  \ then\u201D, Tina huffed, sad the fun bit was over and we had a two hour journey\
  \ back to look forward to.\n\u201COh it really doesn\u2019t matter, I don\u2019\
  t mind going to yours\u201D, intoned Josh, desperate to leave, by any means possible.\n\
  \u201CFirst it\u2019s this massive deal, now suddenly it doesn\u2019t matter?!\u201D\
  \ Tina was shouting now. \n\u201CUm\u2026\u201D Josh looked blank, confused.\n\u201C\
  Well, byeee!\u201D Snapped a furious Tina.\nOff she stomped. Josh made to follow\
  \ her, but I put my hand on his shoulder, stopping him. There was no point trying\
  \ to reason with her when she was like this. The best thing to do now was simply\
  \ to wait. She\u2019d be back in an hour or two, apologetic and full of cuddles.\
  \ But right now, she needed to walk it off, listen to angry music and maybe kick\
  \ a tree if she managed to find one. She needed the space to get the anger out of\
  \ her system.\nNow, our little group goes way back, we know each other pretty well\
  \ by now. We know that when someone gets mad over something as trivial as which\
  \ bus stop to go to, it\u2019s not about the bus stop. It\u2019s never about the\
  \ bus stop. She was just frustrated and needed an outlet, a way to express her feelings\
  \ without tackling them directly. And she knew that we wouldn\u2019t take it personally,\
  \ wouldn\u2019t get offended, wouldn\u2019t turn it into a massive drama. That\u2019\
  s the thing about friendship. We may argue sometimes, but we love each no matter\
  \ what."
