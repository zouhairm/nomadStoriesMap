Text: "My name is Rashmi, I'm from Karnataka, India. In southern part of India we\
  \ never get see snowfall.. so this time I had a chance to go on a trip from our\
  \ college to visit North India, I was very excited to touch and experience the snowfall\
  \ and the happiness of making \u2603\uFE0F. It was a 14 days trip and we would first\
  \ reach New Delhi and from there we marched towards 'Gate way of india' and it was\
  \ very overwhelming to see all the brave martyers name carved on it , and we all\
  \ proceeded to have some snacks and then went to our respective rooms to take some\
  \ from the long 48 hours journey in train from Bangalore to New Delhi. The next\
  \ we have planned to visit two of the famous places one if which was lotus temple\
  \ (the temple is in shape of lotus, hence called lotus temple) we had to leave all\
  \ our gadgets in our bus because they do not allow any of it. After visiting to\
  \ the temple we headed towards 'The Indira Gandhi Memorial Hall'. It was the same\
  \ place where she used to stay and she got killed and everything of her belongings\
  \ are preserved for general public to view in a museum. After Delhi we headed towards\
  \ Shimla,Himanchal Pradesh. It is one of the beautiful city and also it had some\
  \ touch of westernization all of it was new to me and it was a very hilly region\
  \ it was getting difficulty for me to walk and bear the cold, because south indian\
  \ are not used to cold temperature.But few cups of coffee and some hot chocolate\
  \ helped me in keep going and exploring the place. Everyone of us was very amused\
  \ to go on a ride in toy train, which was famous, it passed through tunnels and\
  \ valley's etc. And it was very delightful sight to see. Next stop was at kufri\
  \ the place for adventure and it had many adventure sports like paragliding,net\
  \ climbing, etc. To reach on top of the adventure area we all had to ride on horse.\
  \ It was very muddy and slippery area and the horse ride gave me goosebumps it was\
  \ very scary as it was my time on riding a horse but it was completely safe and\
  \ well trained. We then headed towards kullu for out River rafting and it was a\
  \ mad experience!! I was I could do it again \U0001F602 . Then it was the time for\
  \ my most favorite place MANALI! It is a beautiful and mesmerizing place if Yu know\
  \ where to go in Manali! The temperature was falling to -2\xB0 and coldest amongst\
  \ all the other places .. and we visit to play and make snowmans, to sollang valley\
  \ .. the valley was covered with helps of snows and I was very happy to see the\
  \ beauty of it. After making some not so good snowmans it was time for us to say\
  \ goodbye to all these cold regions and headed towards Jaipur ( the pink city of\
  \ India). The city is famous for the loves of it's forts and the clothes. People\
  \ come here to shop for the prettiest clothes and jewellery and of course to experience\
  \ the Royalty of the forts of the Jaipur. We first visited the Amer fort. It was\
  \ huge and was with beautiful architecture it was well maintained and speaks alot\
  \ about royalty. And now it was time for to say good bye to our North Indian trip\
  \ and we were all set to depart from Jaipur to New Delhi . We got down in Delhi\
  \ and we had booked our train tickets in prior so we had to wait untill our train\
  \ arrives. Our train arrived at 10:40 and we reached to Bangalore after 48hours\
  \ of journey only to catch up another train to our hometown Mysuru. It was a 3 hrs\
  \ journey from Bangalore to Mysuru and here we are at the end of my story after\
  \ reaching home i was very tired but was filled with all the possible good memories\
  \ and experiences to share with my beloved parents who were missing me badly for\
  \ 14 long days \U0001F602\U0001F602 . Thank you!! Bye."
