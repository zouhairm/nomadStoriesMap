Text: "\u201CYou did what?\u201D\n\n\u201CI killed a swan.\u201D\n\nI have been an\
  \ unofficial resident of Lombardy, an Alpine region in northern Italy, for forty-seven\
  \ days. In forty-seven days I have learnt how to ask for a plastic bag in the supermarket.\
  \ I have learnt to accept tardiness with an Italian-style shrug and a smile. I have\
  \ learnt that Pisogne, the small town in which I live, is not actually pronounced\
  \ \u2018piss-on-ya\u2019, as I originally thought. I have met some of the locals,\
  \ one of them being this Mountain Boy sat beside me now, who has, for reasons unknown,\
  \ appointed me as the rightful person in whom to confess his act of felony.\_\n\n\
  \u201CYou know you would get in big trouble for that in England, right? All swans\
  \ belong to Her Majesty The Queen.\u201D\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re not supposed to kill\
  \ swans anywhere, I don\u2019t think\u2026 Do you want to see where I did it?\u201D\
  \n\nWe\u2019re in the van. The seatbelt alarm - broken - beeps for six sets of nineteen,\
  \ as usual, and we turn up the radio and sing loudly to drown out the sound, as\
  \ usual. We slice through the darkness down an offbeaten track. Applying some pressure\
  \ to the brakes, he indicates with his eyes to through the window on my side to\
  \ a spot of long silver grass. He tells me that this is where he crouched panting,\
  \ his arm taut around the animal\u2019s body, which was thrashing against the interior\
  \ of his backpack in a postmortem spasm, as he lay low, avoiding the headlights\
  \ of a passing vehicle. Then we keep going, following the story, the moon following\
  \ us, until the track comes to an end and we find ourselves beside the lake.\_\n\
  \nLake Iseo is a vision, appunto. It is the 60% water that flows through the valley\
  \ people, home to all of their outdoor passions, the \u2018aqua pura\u2019 that\
  \ is vital to their very existence. It is full-bodied and honest. If it is slightly\
  \ green, it means that it is going to rain. Now, beneath the watchful eyes of the\
  \ stars, it is coy. It hides behind those magnificent old mountains, whose beauty\
  \ I haven\u2019t yet (and will never) become accustomed to. Mountain Boy bends down\
  \ to pick up a small, round stone - perfect for skimming - and, for the first time,\
  \ I am conscious of his presence beside me.\_\n\nHe didn\u2019t do it alone. Turns\
  \ out, it was an accomplice who had pulled the trigger that night. He had finished\
  \ off the job with a swift decapitation, \u2018just to try to stop the flapping\u2019\
  , once they had hurled it onto the boat and realised, in a panic, the sheer size\
  \ of the thing. He describes to me the width of a swan\u2019s wing up close, its\
  \ weight, the relentless drum of his own heart beating in his chest. He tells me\
  \ that swans always travel in twos, that the female had flown away in fear and that,\
  \ in the weeks that followed, his guilt would lead him back to this very spot time\
  \ and time again with grainy peace offerings for her, until eventually she disappeared\
  \ and took her loneliness with her.\_\n\nI imagine it now, a childhood spent between\
  \ these mountains. Soft heels against rock before diving into water. The cold bite\
  \ of the snow in the peaks. The thrill and tranquilty of nature. And as he looks\
  \ at me, his eyes wild and full of perversity, I wonder if he feels the distance\
  \ between us. If he sees the empty cider bottles scattered across a multi-storey\
  \ car park, the graffittied walls that tell the story of a childhood spent far away,\
  \ in another corner of creation, reflected in my eyes. Two young lives lived, both\
  \ hungry for more, stumbled momentarily upon the same coordinates. Each one\u2019\
  s world getting wider with each year swallowed up. Then he turns to me and says:\n\
  \n\u201CDo you want to try some? It\u2019s in my freezer.\u201D"
