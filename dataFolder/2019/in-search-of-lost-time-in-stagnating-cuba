Text: "Salsa, rum and cigars versus censorship, poverty and dictatorship. At the time\
  \ my plane was landing at the airport, which looked rather as the plain agricultural\
  \ field, I was thinking that the first combination has become a clich\xE9, whereas\
  \ the second one still remains a devastating reality. \n\nAfter a bumpy landing\
  \ I took my first steps on this terra incognita and looked around: inside of the\
  \ airport was calmingly chilly and as all the passengers stood up in line for a\
  \ check at the customs, I got a feeling that in this country an old soul of mine\
  \ will feel at home. The room reminded me of a center of culture that one can find\
  \ in the post-Soviet countries, and the officer in a dusty green uniform added mysterious\
  \ charm to it. \n\nI began my journey to Trinidad, where the Caribbean sea and my\
  \ see-through dress was the perfect match for a few days in Playa Ancon. Yes, Cuba\
  \ had an impact on my strictly 19th century dressing code. I set myself free for\
  \ a while, allowing to immerse in deep waters of joy and excitement. I met Tony,\
  \ a twenty-something Cuban guy, who was dreaming about horizons that pass the island\u2019\
  s borders. He wanted to study engineering in Germany and support his parents in\
  \ a later future. Tony enjoyed my stories about life in Europe and North America,\
  \ in return, he showed me the hidden paradises of Trinidad. One evening we bicycled\
  \ 10 kilometres one way to Playa just before the storm started. We swam in the sea\
  \ which was dancing salsa with the wind \u2013 waves were enormous but luring to\
  \ embrace the danger. \n\nThat stormy night I could not fall asleep. I was listening\
  \ to the powerful wind, that was ripping the bricks from already decaying buildings.\
  \ The thought came to my mind: what if there is no bright tomorrow in this country?\
  \ The communistic downpour devastated the land irreversibly and the Time is Lost\
  \ for good? \n\nNext morning, I simulated that I feel well, just like American cars\
  \ from the 1950s simulate part of Cuban culture. Soon after arrival in La Habana,\
  \ I learnt a saying \u201CNo es facil\u201D - it is not easy. That is the island\u2019\
  s motto. No es facil, to connect to the expensive internet at the park. Non es facil,\
  \ waiting hours in line for bread in the evening. Nor it is easy to brush the teeth\
  \ with the soap. No es facil to earn 40 CUC per month if you are a doctor, and see\
  \ your neighbour, who is a taxi driver bringing home up to 60 CUC per day. \n\n\
  Just when I got used to the poverty around me, I was invited to stay for a few days\
  \ with my friend\u2019s family. They had a villa with a beautiful Persian garden\
  \ on the outskirts of La Habana. When I first arrived, I saw two little girls near\
  \ the fountain, wearing brand new dresses and playing with a morbidly obese cat.\
  \ I spent three days in this luxurious mansion, enjoying the company of Sofia \u2013\
  \ a Cuban Rapunzel, whose long black hair made her look almost too young to be a\
  \ mother of two little chatter-boxes. Her husband Richo, who looked much older,\
  \ used to come from work in the afternoons and we spent quite some time talking\
  \ about world\u2019s history. I never asked Richo if he is not only the head of\
  \ his family, but also a head of something else. I believe he deeply appreciated\
  \ that I never doubted his honest work and integrity \u2013 two traits Cubans value\
  \ the most \u2013 and as a good-bye present he gave me a pack of very expensive\
  \ cigars.\n\nAs I was waiting for my (unsurprisingly) delayed flight to Germany,\
  \ I thought about how many young men like Tony would take this opportunity and leave\
  \ the island. As I was trying to kill Time at the airport, I realised that It is\
  \ the only hope for a change, and I thought to myself, that I cannot wait for the\
  \ day this country is stopped being romanticised by its poverty. If only that Time\
  \ would come faster."
