Text: it is my first time travel outside of my continent and my coutnry alone with
  whole my life and my stuffs in one bag.I am going to explorer new side of my life
  in italy where I even dont know their language.guess from milan to bari with a good
  train is 11 hours and you have to change your train three times and you dont know
  italian.at the first it sounds horror but I lived that single moments and it worth
  it after getting off the train I saw one of the oldest town I'v ever seen where
  the masters of pasta lived and lives for several generations.I hate walking with
  a bag , a heavy one!! but I walked all streets of this old city carrying my heavy
  bag it was the best expreince ever I had before, that much I didnt want to go to
  a hotel and leave my bag there. after three days being in bari which was like a
  several years of happiness I was excited to take another 12 hours train to genova
  city in the north west of italy,another great city I had Dreaming to see entire
  my life.this trip was harder than the another I had to change four train in night
  and it was when I didnt sleep for three days in bari so hardest part was stay awake.
  and the another surprize!!! these four station didnt have a elevtore so I had to
  carry my stuffs by hand from this part of station to downstairs and them I had to
  go about 40 stairs up,finally I was in genova where I never tought I like it that
  much to stay there and live in that city for two years, even I started to go to
  university in genova and when I leave this city I feel I miss home. we dont know
  what is wait for us in destination so we should go and find maybe its good maybe
  not but if dont go we will never find that out.
