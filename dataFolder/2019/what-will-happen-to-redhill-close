Text: "I don\u2019t feel like waking up but I cannot be late! Singapore has no seasons\
  \ yet today at Redhill Close it feels a bit like autumn. Maybe because of smoky\
  \ haze or dry, fallen leaves on the pavement. Maybe it\u2019s Hungry Ghosts celebration\
  \ that leaves scraps of burned paper all around? Maybe.\n\nYunQin is so kind to\
  \ share her Saturday morning with me and it would be impolite to make her wait.\
  \ She greets me together with her 16-months-old daughter at 9 am sharp. Little girl\
  \ is falling asleep as we walk, she was already up for three hours.\n\nThis Saturday\
  \ morning is a day like any other here at Redhill Close, people buy vegetables at\
  \ the wet market and the food stalls are bustling. We are hungry too. YunQin\u2019\
  s husband and older daughter await us at the yellow, plastic table with hot roti\
  \ prata and we share it. It\u2019s a local specialty of multilayered Indian bread,\
  \ served with light curry and sugar. We also buy famous runny eggs followed by toasts\
  \ filled with butter blocks and coconut jam called Kaya. To finish, a few cups of\
  \ steaming Teh Tarik, local tea blend with sugar and frothy foam of condensed milk\
  \ on top,  It\u2019s all delicious and I have already forgotten how hard it was\
  \ to wake up.\n\nYunQuin\u2019s family always lived in this area but will soon have\
  \ to leave Redhill Close as it is up for redevelopment. It will be sad to see.\n\
  \nHuman dynamic in this neighborhood seems so smooth. Vibrant crowd shops for anything\
  \ one can imagine, wrinkled uncles - once local gang members - play mahjong, while\
  \ children enjoy the playground and passionately browse colorful cookie displays\
  \ placed right next to the street. Vegetable merchant at the market knows YunQin\u2019\
  s Mother and cuts her the nicest piece of pumpkin, we also buy some fresh fish for\
  \ girl\u2019s daily porridge.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago the government official came\
  \ to announce that they need to move out in less than 2 years. As I walk between\
  \ 1950\u2019s style housing I\u2019m deeply charmed by the arched facades, red columns,\
  \ roof-sheltered alleys. It\u2019s hard not to feel nostalgic, even if I see this\
  \ place for the first time and I have no relatives here.\n\nIt\u2019s an oasis of\
  \ calm, benches invite me to sit and contemplate on random rocks, spread across\
  \ the lawn. It\u2019s so relaxing and it will be missed. YunQin loves living here,\
  \ she tells me that the IKEA advert was probably filmed here. It\u2019s not certain\
  \ because aluminum postboxes are a bit of a city staple but she thinks it was here\u2026\
  or maybe elsewhere on the island? Nothing is 100% sure here at Redhill Close apart\
  \ from the upcoming redevelopment.\n\nNew construction will likely change this neighborhood\
  \ forever, hopefully the community will be strong enough to keep the market and\
  \ hawker center intact but the alleys and rock gardens will be gone. \n\nWe stroll\
  \ a little more around cozy street, older then Singapore itself. I will come here\
  \ again soon to get this autumn feel whenever I miss four seasons\u2026"
