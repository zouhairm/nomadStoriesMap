Text: "Growing up as an immigrant, I was always enamoured by the idea of a homeland.\
  \ However, it was not until college that I decided to leave everything behind in\
  \ search of my roots in Eastern Europe. Kozushko is the name that I inherited from\
  \ my Belarusian forefathers. I has been with me since birth, marking me with questions\
  \ of my heritage. Most importantly, it is the name belonging to the people in the\
  \ photograph I took to Belarus in search of answers. \n\tI was twenty years old\
  \ when I boarded an Aer Lingus plane destined for Dublin. I brought a snowboarding\
  \ jacket for the cold I would face, a new backpack eager for its first adventure,\
  \ and my dad\u2019s old guitar. \n\tMy plan was simple: make my way across Northern\
  \ Europe to Belarus, head to my grandfather\u2019s village, and show someone the\
  \ old photo of my relatives in hopes that they were still alive. From anarchist\
  \ squatters in Ireland to the poppies of Remembrance Day in London and onward into\
  \ the the former Soviet Bloc, I felt as though I was journeying into the past. I\
  \ crossed into Belarus from Poland at some point in-between night and dawn. The\
  \ fully-fatigued border patrol gave me great incentive to look as little like a\
  \ westerner as I could muster. After months of dreaming, I was in the country of\
  \ my ancestors. \n\tI met up with the guides who would assist me in my quest to\
  \ find my relatives. In their small apartment adorned with old floral wallpaper,\
  \ we pored over an online directory and finally uncovered the address of a potential\
  \ relative in my grandfather\u2019s village. We departed the following morning;\
  \ it was a cold drive, five hours south towards the Ukrainian border. By this point,\
  \ I was quite accustomed to sleeping on buses so, throughout the ride, I shifted\
  \ smoothly between waking and dreaming. During moments of consciousness, I looked\
  \ out over the flat frosty fields of Belarus. There were no mountains or hills\u2014\
  just forests and large clearings. The sky was grey and the scene bore no colour.\
  \ \n\tUpon our arrival in Mankavichi, I took a moment to survey the quiet village.\
  \ There were not many people around and no one at our potential address\u2014only\
  \ a donkey-drawn wagon and rows of small, rectangular colourful houses connected\
  \ by a network of dirt roads. I sat in the back seat, bundled up in my jacket with\
  \ the photograph in my hands, as we circled the village looking for direction. Finally,\
  \ we encountered an elderly woman wearing a traditional scarf on her head. I stepped\
  \ out of the car and, in my broken Russian, introduced myself. When I showed her\
  \ the photo and explained who my grandfather was, she seemed to understand and silently\
  \ began leading me down the dirt road. Eventually, we encountered my first relative\u2014\
  Galina\u2014who greeted me with surprising nonchalance and suggested that I stay\
  \ in the village and allow my family to find a bride for me. \n\tAfter settling\
  \ in, I bid farewell to my English-speaking friends from Minsk and surrendered to\
  \ complete immersion in my Belarusian heritage. The next couple of weeks were a\
  \ whirlwind of meeting unknown relatives, walking along the river where my grandfather\
  \ played as a boy, and visiting another village where I discovered more family.\
  \ I felt surprisingly welcome in Belarus, as if it had been home all along but I\
  \ had only just now arrived. The warmth that I felt from my family stood in stark\
  \ contrast to the melancholic haze surrounding the village. Despite being virtual\
  \ strangers, I felt an unprecedented bond. This is where my story began, before\
  \ I was even an idea, but rather just a strand of DNA. \n\tBelarus gave me a sense\
  \ of identity and a deeper gratitude for my great-grandfather\u2019s journey. He\
  \ ventured to Canada hoping to create a new and better life. Although he did not\
  \ live long enough to see the fruits of his labour, I recognize that I was afforded\
  \ far greater opportunity because of his struggle. Although I can\u2019t thank my\
  \ great-grandfather for that gift, sharing his story is my tribute to his legacy."
