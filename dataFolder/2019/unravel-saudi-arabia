Text: "In my wildest dreams, it never crossed that I could set foot on Kingdom of\
  \ Saudi Arabia. In the media and social media, you only hear about negative things\
  \ towards the country, It didnt interest me at all! It just scared me.  In 2016\
  \ that all changed, my husband was offered a job that was too good to turn down,\
  \ after him being there for a year, I came to stay. I was petrified when I first\
  \ came, This would change very quickly. \n\nAs Saudi Arabia is a muslim country\
  \ and that most of their lives work around Islam. This means when I arrived I had\
  \ to wear an abaya, there was no need to cover my face. \nI love travelling, one\
  \ of my favourite things is looking out the window on approach to see the city,\
  \ I was hoping for the same in Dammam but quickly realised that the airport was\
  \ surrounded by desert. \nMy trip from the airport to our  apartment was an eye\
  \ opener. For a second, I could have swear I am in America! In the middle of Arizona\
  \ desert. Massive multi lane highways, American trucks, American muscle cars, American\
  \ fastfood chains all around us! \nFew minutes laters, I then got my first taste\
  \ of Saudi Life, when we drove into residential area, I was met with Massive houses,\
  \ size of which most of us will call Mansions.  \nWhen I got into our apartment,\
  \ I felt like I was back in the UK, shape, decor, and tv channels just like being\
  \ at home! Except its way much bigger! \nThat evening my husband took me to dinner,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t sure what the options would be. I was surprised when we ended up\
  \ at the mall, surrounded by food court which was almost all western choices of\
  \ food. \nI\u2019ve now been here for almost  two years, its flown so fast and one\
  \ thing I can say is that I have never felt unsafe nor disrespected. \nOne time\
  \ my Husband and I went for a long drive to see the camels. It was a sight to behold,\
  \ hundreds of camel as far as your eyes can see, and some are in the road with us.\
  \ It is a vast desert, we drive past a group of people sand dune bashing, we also\
  \ drove past local in the desert ( next to thier cars) some doing barbecue, others\
  \ just chilling. \nWe stop to take photos of the camels, desert and sunset. I went\
  \ to crossed the multi lane highway to take photos, my husband was in the other\
  \ side of the highway taking photos too, local cars stops to ask if my husband have\
  \ a car trouble, on my side a local family stop along side me, if I needed help,\
  \ to which I said I am okay, that I am taking photos and I pointed my husband at\
  \ the other side of the highway. They have waited for me to take photos and insisted\
  \ to send me to the other side of the highway where my husband was. \nThis type\
  \ of kindless I did not expect! \n\nIs this place perfect? Ofcourse not, What country\
  \ is. All i can say is sometimes you have to make your own judgement about things,\
  \ being here and living here gave me the chance to do that."
