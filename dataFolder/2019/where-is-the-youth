Text: "Where is The Youth?\nBy: Amira Shokr \n\nThe smoky heat of the sunset in Taxco,\
  \ Mexico surrounded me and a small crowd of people seeking for honest silver in\
  \ a cramped market. I walked out to greet a dusty blue sky, the last wisps of orange\
  \ from the dying sun stain the impending night sky. A few people walked past me\
  \ towards the heart of the town where the sound of music and laughter trickles down\
  \ the alleyways towards me. \n\nI tilted my head back, still nauseated from the\
  \ car ride, my mouth in need of a toothbrush, and my sweater too hot on my skin,\
  \ sticking with sweat from the warm day. I heard a scraping sound a little too close\
  \ for comfort, and looked to my side to see an old man hunched over a half-open\
  \ wooden box filled with mints, gum, and throat lozenges. His face was wrinkled,\
  \ the skin folded in many layers around his face, his eyes did not greet mine, it\
  \ seemed liked youth had never been present in him. Perhaps it hadn\u2019t. \n\n\
  Throughout the day children had approached me, they spoke quick and assertive Spanish,\
  \ shoving their bracelets, wallets, and souvenirs towards me. Their voices were\
  \ small and pleading. Their small hands clutching their products, preaching their\
  \ price to every passerby. They never smiled, laughed, or looked like they had any\
  \ fun. These children eight or nine years old, their eyes in search of one goal:\
  \ money. No young spirit, no childlike amusement, only business. Once I would decline,\
  \ the children would immediately turn away on to their next prospective customer,\
  \ hands outstretched, I heard their tiny voices get tinier with every refusal. Would\
  \ a sale make them smile?\n\nIt is not a pleasant sight, children doing business\
  \ with you, but nothing quite got to me the way this old man did. He was so thin\
  \ with his body turning in on itself. He shuffled around with a cane in one hand\
  \ and his wooden box in the other. His body moved slow, swaying slightly, asking\
  \ the other people around if they would like anything. A gentle shove towards them,\
  \ and a slow pull away at every disregard. He did the same as the children, but\
  \ with no hope. He had hardly waited to hear me say anything before walking away,\
  \ already assuming I would refuse him. I watched him leave and go down a pair of\
  \ steep steps, where he struggled to descend with his cane. \n\nThis man looked\
  \ close to death, the complete opposite of the children I had seen earlier. This\
  \ man had no more ahead of him, his life ending in selling gum to tourists in a\
  \ town catered to lavish restaurants and stores filled with opulent silver. The\
  \ town is not for its own people, it is for foreigners like me that cannot speak\
  \ Spanish, that have every dollar to spare for every twenty pesos they need.  \n\
  \nThe children selling have a life ahead of them. One day they may decide they won\u2019\
  t sell souvenirs anymore, but the old man is living off of so little that he continues\
  \ to go out and sell mints on the sidewalks for a couple of pesos to get by. That\
  \ old man might be dead by now, I wonder if he had spent is whole life selling gum.\
  \ How many more countries have this sad truth? How many can we see, visit, experience,\
  \ and possibly change? Can we change?"
