Text: "His toothless grin is the first thing I notice about him. It is difficult to\
  \ do otherwise: it seems like time made the rest of his facial features shrunk,\
  \ highlighting his wide mouth with only one last proud tooth standing on the lower\
  \ jaw. We picked Humberto up at one of the many small villages built along the only\
  \ road connecting the Peruvian towns of Taraporto and Yurimaguas, both situated\
  \ in the upper part of the Amazon rainforest, where mountains meet the tropical\
  \ vegetation. I hitched a ride on the back of an open truck in Tarapoto, and now\
  \ I am sitting on bags of corns and potatoes, together with two young girls wearing\
  \ school uniforms.\nThe place where Humberto stops the truck, waving with a machete\
  \ in his hand, is actually hardly a village. It is more of a number of wooden houses\
  \ with laminated roofs spread along the road, most of them selling food or offering\
  \ to use their toilet. The truck abruptly stops next to the old man, and I move\
  \ on the side as much as I can in order to give him some room. Before climbing on\
  \ the back, he throws in two big papayas, a plastic bag full of peanuts, and two\
  \ sugar canes. Then, despite the age, he easily jumps in. He is a short, thin man:\
  \ he wears a shirt tucked into a pair of oversized blue jeans, held on by a belt\
  \ buckled through the last hole. His wrinkled face is partially covered by a baseball\
  \ hat. \nHe sits on a bag of corn next to me, adjusting all his belongings under\
  \ his feet so to keep the peanuts out of the schoolgirls reach. Unlike the rest\
  \ of the people I met along my journey in Peru, he does not seem too interested\
  \ in knowing what a white girl, a gringa, is doing traveling on her own. Instead\
  \ he takes his machete and cuts a small piece of the sugar cane, offering it to\
  \ me. \nWhile we travel down the bumpy road, racing way beyond the speed limit along\
  \ waterfalls and ravines, surrounded by more different kinds of trees that I could\
  \ name, the old man asks me if I own a machete too, at home. He is surprised when\
  \ I tell him I do not. \u201CWell, chica, my name is Humberto. And Humberto was\
  \ the name of my father and of my grandfather. And this is the machete I inherited\
  \ from my family\u201D. He starts telling me that being Humberto is not just a matter\
  \ of names. The Humberto of the family \u2013 so to say, the first born male of\
  \ very generation, gets to inherit the family machete that, now I see, looks a bit\
  \ rusty and not too sharp. \nHe comes from a native village on the Amazon river,\
  \ and explains that the machete connects his family with the yacurunas, the spirits\
  \ and creatures living under the rivers. Humberto tells me that he set a mermaid\
  \ free with his machete when he was a teenager. A mermaid? I think. However, he\
  \ does not seem to notice the skeptical look on my face. The mermaid was trapped\
  \ in his fishing net, he explains, and he set her free by cutting the net that got\
  \ stuck around her tail. \u201CHer name was Isab\xE9l\u201D Humberto says \u201C\
  Since then, she came to visit me every year. Well, in the last years I saw her a\
  \ bit less. I am not as good looking as I used to be and she got married, you know\u201D\
  . Humberto sighs, lost in his thoughts. For the rest of the journey he keeps quiet.\
  \ \nHumberto gets off at another village along the road. I look at him from the\
  \ truck, watching his small figure disappearing in the distance. He holds the machete\
  \ tight, like he does not want to part from it. And then I realize the importance\
  \ of being Humberto: in his hand he is not only holding a machete. He is holding\
  \ his inheritance, the history of his family and of his community. The myths and\
  \ the spirits of the Amazon jungle. Safe in his hand, he holds a whole world."
