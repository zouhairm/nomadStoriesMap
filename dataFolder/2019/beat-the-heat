Text: "Different place different situation. Arrive in the Hyatt Chennai Hotel to be\
  \ one of the choosen  people to see how the traditional fabric called handloom in\
  \ Chennai India. Our trip was 3 days, 2 full day  to see the Chennai exhibition\
  \ centre and enough to feel how India is for beginning. The journey from airport\
  \ to hotel remind me about Indonesia back years. Hot, dry, crowded, traffic is the\
  \ view you can feel and see from my journey from airport to the hotel. Many road\
  \ under construction include the highway. In small road All vehicles is passing\
  \ :  cars, motorbikes, include the people - no sign and special place for people\
  \ cross the road, you just jump your self into it, and hope they will stop. And\
  \ please add the cow too. Yes, it's real cow. Before I only heard that cow can walk\
  \ in wherever it\u2019s, now I see it by myself, and no one stop it. As Indian is\
  \ believing in cow as one of their holy. I'm not very shock as I heard before, but\
  \ I'm sure my face at that time is very exciting to see the whole thing. \nYes,\
  \ Chennai is one the industrial area in India and like Indonesia, they are a developing\
  \ country. But hey\u2026 this is one of  great experience I have when visit a country.\
  \ \n\nNext day at 9 am, the bus already waiting for us to take to Chennai Exhibition\
  \ Centre.  we came into the Chennai Exhibition Centre and we have our tour together\
  \ with almost 50 people who get this opportunity like me from all of country, before\
  \ we split into our own. There\u2019s part of the handloom corner exhibition. After\
  \ a man finish the handloom, we had small discussion as I\u2019m curious with the\
  \ technique, even here in Indonesia we still have traditional technique, but to\
  \ see others, it\u2019s amazing. I asked the process, how long the production, and\
  \ of course at the end prices. It won\u2019t lie that people want cheap price, but\
  \ still with strory telling how is the production made, it will increase the price.\
  \ And  a guy from Irish came closer to us to hear about the story. At the end, my\
  \ conversation and the Irish guy is become wider about the country and what do expect\
  \ from this 3 days trip. \n\nIt\u2019s very excited me to see this development country\
  \ and I want to come again to see the difference in couple of years\u2026"
