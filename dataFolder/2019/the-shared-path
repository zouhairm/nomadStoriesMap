Text: "We had almost stumbled across it, between our tourist-crowded wanderings around\
  \ the Colosseum, the Trevi fountain, and all the things that come up first on the\
  \ \u201Cmust-dos\u201D of a visit to Rome. The archaic city was allegedly founded\
  \ by the twins Romulus and Remus, but on this day, we were at the metropolitan\u2019\
  s peripherals on the Appian Way, a bus ride south of the brimming streets. \n\n\
  Although the old path isn't something you necessarily stumble across in the ancient\
  \ city, we had come across a bike rental store at the trail\u2019s head.\n\n\u201C\
  Let\u2019s do it,\u201D my identical twin sister, Ash, said, and so there we were,\
  \ riding rented bikes on the last day of our vacation together. I was spending a\
  \ year teaching English in France \u2014 the longest time we have ever been apart\
  \ from each other \u2014 and she had flown across the Atlantic from our hometown\
  \ of Philadelphia to visit me. It was her idea to take a wayward route out of the\
  \ center of things. \n\nBefore her arrival, I had been tentative about the trip.\
  \ We have always been incredibly close, as twins often are, but being a twin can\
  \ morph you, 0ften, into one identity. It\u2019s hard to forge your own path while\
  \ simultaneously living in tandem with someone who you\u2019ve shared your life\
  \ with. \n\n\u201CThis is the best day of the trip so far!\u201D\u2019she shouted\
  \ back at me, bumping over the crags and divots on her bike. Though the weather\
  \ was airy and warm, there was barely anyone on the uneven stones of the path on\
  \ this last day of October.\n\nNeither of us really liked crowds, and while places\
  \ like St Peter\u2019s Basilica made me catch my breath more than once with its\
  \ domes and pillars, Bernini\u2019s bronzed and cascading Baldachin standing at\
  \ the center, I knew precisely what she meant as I exhaled through my slightly straining\
  \ lungs: eroded stones, gold-stained foliage and the tinged breaths of a fleeting\
  \ fall.  \n\nWe had watched a video the night before about the ancient path, how\
  \ it was constructed in 312 BC to transp0rt military supplies during the Samnite\
  \ Wars. Over time, the path gathered other fragments that had assembled its shared\
  \ history: the church where Peter encountered the vision of Christ, entrances to\
  \ the Catacombs where Christians buried their dead, half-standing marble ruins.\
  \ \n\nWe passed all of this, along with old stone forts worn by rain and time, fields\
  \ reaching east and west as we cut through the center. Sometimes Ash lead the way,\
  \ sometimes I did.\n\nEarlier on in the week, we were getting ready to go out, her\
  \ in the bathroom, I in front of the mirror.\n\n\u201COf course I miss you, Dani,\
  \ but the distance is good for us,\u201D Ash said. It was something I had talked\
  \ about with our mom before Ash had arrived, and she had agreed. \n\n\u201CBeing\
  \ apart from each other will help you become your own person, the both of you,\u201D\
  \ my mom had said.\n\nWe pulled our bikes over on the side of the path. \n\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m gonna go this way,\u201D she said, gesturing to the wide field stretching\
  \ westward. \n\nI got out my small notebook that I keep with me in my backpack.\n\
  \nYou can see the world in two ways: there are either a trillion small things, or\
  \ just one, the way this one wooden spoke of this fence here on the Appian Way is\
  \ a part of the one great road that leads to Rome. And now, my sister is calling\
  \ my name from the field, the smell of pine and ancient stone \u2014 \n\nI looked\
  \ up; she was holding out a piece of stale blue clay that she had found on her wandering.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI wonder how old it is,\u201D she said, flushed cheeks, examining the\
  \ different planes and edges. I too wondered how long the small piece of clay had\
  \ laid in the dark dirt of the path, and what the whole vase would have looked like\
  \ before it broke. \n\nI took a picture of the small shard. \u201CA memory,\u201D\
  \ I said, smiling, before we both took off on our bikes again, this time with her\
  \ leading the way."
