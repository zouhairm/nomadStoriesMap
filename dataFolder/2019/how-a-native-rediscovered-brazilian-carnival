Text: "As the sun rises, I get ready for Carnaval. Being born a Brazilian, these four\
  \ days are almost part of our bodies considering that is one of the few moments\
  \ when we can all cheer up life itself without fear or shame.\n \nIn the State of\
  \ Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil, where I was born and raised, two cities make\
  \ carnival even special. Recife and Olinda aren\u2019t as famous as Rio de Janeiro,\
  \ but they can build a perfect moment for us, locals, to rediscover connections\
  \ to our homelands.\n \nI put some glitter on my face and wear gorgeous clothes\
  \ but I cannot wear the fancy ones, because the place is the old town of Olinda\
  \ that is famous for its slopes and the street carnival where anyone can join. The\
  \ city is quite known for block parades as O Bloco da Lama (Mud block), which I\
  \ intend to go and it\u2019s essential to be detached from clothes because of the\
  \ way they celebrate.\n \nPeople throw mud at each other to honour the heritage\
  \ of Chico Science, a famous musician who used his voice to speak about the poor\
  \ and forgotten communities of Pernambuco back in the 1990s. All of this in a celebration\
  \ to the Mangue (mangrove), important tropical vegetation typical of coastal and\
  \ salt areas. The mud is part of the mangrove and smearing in them is a way of resistance.\n\
  \ \nAlthough my body practically overfloats with the swing of the bus down the avenue,\
  \ people full of glitter through their bodies happily sing, even if they stand up\
  \ sweating for the whole trip, they will cheer up. The party happens before even\
  \ starts.\n \nTHREE PER TEN!\n \nA loud yell comes from out of the bus; the peddlers\
  \ are trying to sell their products. Perhaps, that is the most heard phrase in all\
  \ Carnival. Three beer cans per ten reais (R$) and it is cheap; happiness comes\
  \ from these noises. Drinking is an important part of carnival and it is even better\
  \ if the beer is cold hence to the heat of Olinda\u2019s summer.\n \nWhen I got\
  \ there, I noticed missing beautiful details about the historic city where I had\
  \ always frequented but had never really seen before. Under a burning sun and a\
  \ bright blue sky, sweating humans celebrate the heat, kids fire at you with water\
  \ guns to cool down your skin. Then, I\u2019ve got myself reconnected to my homeland.\
  \ I see, among drunk and dancing bodies, tourists waiting patiently in line with\
  \ their large suitcases in front of the small and colourful houses that shelter\
  \ them during these days of revelry. Perhaps their feet and souls could not help\
  \ dancing motionless to the sound of Frevo. \n \nAs I get muddy all over my body\
  \ while dancing to Frevo - a fast-paced an animated typical musical genre from Pernambuco\
  \ - I notice how Olinda\u2019s street carnival is a symbol of resistance against\
  \ repression. Back in the 1970s, Brazil suffered from a military dictatorship, which\
  \ controlled our right to walk freely on the streets. Carnival was the time when\
  \ people could get their voices heard. Eu acho \xE9 pouco or the closest meaning\
  \ \u201CIt could be worse\u201D is another famous block parade that exists since\
  \ 1977 as a way of striking back the repression.\n \nRESISTANCE!\n \nAn unhappy\
  \ crowd shout out about their desires while walking over the hillsides of Olinda.\
  \ Nowadays, we have an ex-military president who exalts the period of the dictatorship\
  \ that imposed tough measures such as the withdrawal of minority rights while sustaining\
  \ an ideal social conservatism. That is the moment of a total break with normality;\
  \ thanks to the free streets that makes ordinary people be able to come and celebrate\
  \ whenever they wish.\n \nI am at home, not where I sleep at night, but the place\
  \ where I see free love being shown with no fear of violence, the outcry for unanswered\
  \ desires and the bodies boiling into the heat of the sun just to praise life. The\
  \ air that walks through my hair makes me rediscover the soul of Pernambuco that\
  \ always lived inside me. I am a native."
