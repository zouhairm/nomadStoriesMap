Text: "Travel has always been a big passion of mine; it encompasses my love for food,\
  \ culture and history. I have travelled to many places before, including New Orleans,\
  \ Russia, Japan, Italy. But for all these trips, I was in the company of close friends\
  \ and family. Three years into my corporate 9 to 5, I had an itch to see the world.\
  \ This feeling was so overwhelming that I decided to quit my job and travel full-time.\n\
  \nMy life as I know it changed on September 10, 2018. It began like any other day:\
  \ I woke up, brushed my teeth, got dressed, and had breakfast. I then proceeded\
  \ to say goodbye to my family and carried my 46L backpack out the door. It was only\
  \ when I got to the airport and stepped onto a United flight bound for Singapore\
  \ that it truly hit me that I was beginning my first solo adventure around the world.\
  \ \n\nAs the cabin lights dimmed and the plane began to take off, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but feel anxious, thinking to myself, \u201Cwhat have I done?\u201D I left\
  \ my well paying job, my family and friends, and my girlfriend behind--for all a\
  \ leap into the unknown. Then I started thinking, \u201CWhat if I don't meet anyone?\
  \ And if I did, would they like me?\u201D It was classic high school all over again,\
  \ my insecurities creeping their way back into my mind. Growing up, I had a fear\
  \ of being alone. I couldn't really do anything alone and needed the company of\
  \ others to enjoy myself. It was pretty bad to the point where I left this concert\
  \ of a band I really liked because I couldn't find my friends in the arena.\n\n\
  I knew I needed to tackle my fears head on. \n\nFast forward six months later, I\
  \ find myself already half way through this endeavour. I have seen wondrous sights\
  \ that have taken my breath away--from exploring the majestic Angkor Wat in Cambodia,\
  \ to witnessing glittering lanterns at the Loi Krathong Festival in Thailand, and\
  \ seeing the surreal dunes of Len\xE7\xF3is Maranhenses in Brazil. Moreover, I have\
  \ made countless friends and connections from all around the world. There were even\
  \ moments where I gravitated towards being alone, to have some time to reflect.\
  \ Slowly, before I knew it, I have learned to be comfortable with my solitude--eating\
  \ alone, going to the cinemas alone, walking on a beach alone. \n\nPresently in\
  \ Brazil, I\u2019ve found it difficult to communicate with others due to my lack\
  \ of Portuguese or Spanish skills. The majority of other travellers are either Brazilian\
  \ or from other South American countries, and not a lot of people are fluent in\
  \ English. Fortunately the locals are the most friendly people I've ever met; they\
  \ are always eager to help out foreigners despite the language barrier. Their smiles\
  \ and friendly demeanor are so contagious. I remember an interaction I had with\
  \ an Uber driver in Iguazu Falls. He started speaking Portuguese to me and in my\
  \ limited repertoire I replied back \u201Cno fala portugu\xEAs.\u201D Using Google\
  \ Translate, he asked if I knew any Brazilian music, in which I only knew Michel\
  \ Telo\u2019s, \"Ai Se Eu Te Pego.\u201D He laughed in excitement as he puts the\
  \ song on his car stereo. We sang along together, and it became a duet. As he drops\
  \ me off at my hostel, we shook hands and parted ways. Turns out a mixture of hand\
  \ signals, Google Translate and broken Portuguese and English can go a long way."
