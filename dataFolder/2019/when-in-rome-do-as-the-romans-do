Text: "Living in the closet is still a reality for many gay men in Brazil, amid mould\
  \ and smell of Naphthalene, especially for guys who grew up in families that follow\
  \ the Roman Catholic Church. Well, that was my reality in the year 2013 and it was\
  \ also a time of professional growth for me. Due to a great proposal of work, I\
  \ moved to live in a small city in the state of S\xE3o Paulo, exercising an important\
  \ position in the company. In a job that required a lot of me and extremely stressful,\
  \ I lost social life and I found myself increasingly sunk and forgotten in the back\
  \ of the closet. But my story would change when on my first vacation, I decided\
  \ to visit \"the house of the Pope\". It has always been a dream for me to know\
  \ the cradle of the Catholic church and see places formerly budded by me only in\
  \ history books and religious magazines. What I did not expect was that instead\
  \ of a meeting with historic buildings and ancient churches, I would connect with\
  \ the deepest and truest self to discover my sexuality.\nHomosexuality, governed\
  \ by rules of protocol, was a common practice in Roma until the adoption of Catholicism\
  \ and in the early years of the Roman Republic, pederasty was forbidden. However,\
  \ the bosses could have sex with their slaves, provided they were top in the sex\
  \ act. At the time of the Roma Empire, pederasty was not only legalized, but the\
  \ marriage was also permitted between men since private activities did not concern\
  \ the criminal court. Male prostitution became a common practice, and there were\
  \ public restrooms where men went looking for homosexual relationships, as well\
  \ as a series of gesture and dress codes that indicated when a subject wanted to\
  \ relate to a relative. Lesbian relationships were not governed by any law, probably\
  \ because, given the gender norms in force, these occurred domestically, far from\
  \ the inquisitive eyes of the censors.\nBut what I found in Rome were men who, like\
  \ me, were also living in the closet repressed by Christian culture, but despite\
  \ their homophobic repression, they did not resist their sex and love wishes. If\
  \ these men who can not get their hands on the streets as a couple, they can in\
  \ saunas, public toilets, gay bars or indoors with all the curtains closed, perform\
  \ the most unimaginable sexual fantasies.\nMarco, Alessandro, Giuseppe, Antonio,\
  \ Luca, Giovanni, this story tells in each chapter my encounter with each one of\
  \ them and about how they taught me to discover and love me as a gay man in a world\
  \ where love can be the greatest of sins."
