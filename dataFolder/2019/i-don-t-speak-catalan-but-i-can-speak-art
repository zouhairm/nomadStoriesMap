Text: "We are in Catalonia, not Spain. Catalonia. The Catalan culture is rich and\
  \ diverse. They have their own language, own flag, and over the centuries has developed\
  \ its own unique identity. I was fortunate to join a group of 3 theatre professionals\
  \ travelling to Centre d\u2019Art i Natura de Farrera for an artist-in-residency\
  \ program. We were there to co-produce and teach theatre acting, dance, and English\
  \ with the local high school, Hug Roger III in Sort. MONSTERS is a musical based\
  \ on Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein. We use performance-art as a communication\
  \ platform to promote anti-bullying, anti-violence and anti-racism. We collaborated\
  \ with them to research on mythical creatures and legends of the Catalunya and produced\
  \ a performance.\nAs a first time traveller myself, I am aware of the local customs\
  \ and manners. Especially travelling to smaller communities, where people have never\
  \ been out of their villages and never dreamt of meeting a magical creature called:\
  \ an asian-canadian girl. As much as I would love to share with you all my entire\
  \ November adventure in the Upper-Pyrenees, you will just have to wait; because\
  \ you are in for a special treat! Hop onto my broom! Let\u2019s fly off to meet\
  \ the magical creatures of Catalunya including a real village witch!\n \n      \
  \   Our first stop is the bus stop. Our bus driver lady is a strong, independent\
  \ woman. Why? As a young driver myself, I can\u2019t imagine driving more than an\
  \ hour. Let alone 6 hours all the way from Barcelona. The scenery is breathtaking,\
  \ literally as we are climbing up to 1365 metres of altitude. Mountain goats parading\
  \ on dangerous cliffs, vultures watching above. Our bus driver was moody to us,\
  \ as we're outsiders who don\u2019t speak a word in Catalan. I saw that, so I drew\
  \ a thank-you card. Our stop was the last one, a couple of us were sleeping and\
  \ the driver hurried us off with disapproval. I gave her the card. She took it,\
  \ looked at it. Her eyes were big and full of surprise. A huge smile followed and\
  \ she helped us with our luggages! She loves her job and have been a bus driver\
  \ for over a decade. Immediately, she recognized my illustration is the iconic Mont\
  \ Serrat. She hugged me, thanked me and asked for a signature. She said this was\
  \ the first time someone has given her a hand-drawn card by an artist. It was so\
  \ wonderful! At last, We said our goodbyes and right after she drove off, our group\
  \ asked \u201C What did you give her? \" \n         This sparked a new idea: to\
  \ meet locals through the language of art. I don\u2019t speak catalan, but I can\
  \ speak art. Communicating is frustrating without a common language. How can I express\
  \ my gratitude in a foreign place? I want to explore deeper into communicating with\
  \ people more than just the knowledge of spoken languages. From that short connection\
  \ with the bus driver, I have decided to make thank you cards.\n         Here\u2019\
  s a tiny taste of how I craft my cards based on the story of individuals I\u2019\
  ve had the pleasure to connect with.\nHug Roger III Secondary School: A watercolour\
  \ illustration of the entire performance cast as their chosen mythical creatures,\
  \ which got published in their newspaper.\nTati Finchi: The brussel artivist who\
  \ speaks 5 languages and the key-bridge for us to communicate with the students.\
  \ A great mom, who is proud of her village, Alendo population of 8. Can you guess\
  \ what I drew her?\nAnna: The village witch (Bruxia) She is now a part-time witch,\
  \ and a full time housekeeper and cat mom. She doesn\u2019t speak a word of english.\
  \ But we did a lot of hand signs and acting! Which became our form of communication.\
  \ I painted her cats around her.\n          We weren\u2019t here to just teach.\
  \ I have learned from every single story spoken. By gifting back my art to each\
  \ person, I have earned the connection to keep-in-touch with locals through social\
  \ media. Connection with all the magical creatures from Catalunya. Wow. Truly, what\
  \ a treat for me"
