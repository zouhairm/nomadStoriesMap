Text: "-\tTable for two?\n-\tNo, just for one, thank you!\n\nI now know that if I\
  \ wait for others to bring me happiness, I\u2019d only grow bitter and cynical ahead\
  \ of time. So I took the suitcase in my own hands, packed my enthusiasm, curiosity,\
  \ and courage and planned my first solo trip. \n\nI spent my time wandering through\
  \ the cobbled streets of Valencia looking for my hostel through the looking glass\
  \ of Google Maps the night before my trip.\n\nStepping on the same street in front\
  \ of the hostel the next morning and eating my first bocadillo in the absolutely\
  \ gorgeous Mercado Central felt even better than a hazy 3D representation. I breathed\
  \ in the Valencian vibe \u2013 a mix between the subtle deference to the Moors that\
  \ shaped the city and the love for street art, traditional silk dresses and nature,\
  \ all with a twist of the refreshing Agua de Valencia, the local drink.\n\nI passed\
  \ by Gothic structures, the modern masterpieces in Ciudad de las Artes y las Ciencias\
  \ and the fused Romanesque and baroque influences sculpted in the walls of the Cathedral.\
  \ In between, I started seeing other forms of art, such as the colorful murals painted\
  \ on the walls. The street art of Valencia is a tour itself, with bits and pieces\
  \ of the locals\u2019 hearts and stories. The abstract representation of the faces\
  \ of those who endure the atrocity of war every day, in every corner of this world\
  \ left a stamp on my brain.\n\nAs I was exploring the narrow streets, where the\
  \ traffic is banned from unsettling the living history, I started putting a face\
  \ to my new favorite place.\nValencia was flooded in 1957 when the rain pushed the\
  \ Turia River to spread its unruly arms and cover the city. There was little to\
  \ no resistance from Valencia, as there was nothing to be done. The crushing arms\
  \ retreated and left a mess behind. Valencia carved a sign to mark the water level\
  \ that almost destroyed it and turned the riverbed into a 7-kilometer long park.\
  \ \n\nThe Valencia I was lucky to meet bears the face of resilience and dignity\
  \ in front of the waves of historic changes and influences. It bears expression\
  \ wrinkles from smiling at me with the love and understanding of an ancient goddess.\
  \ \n\nGoing on a trip by myself was more than ordering a table for one and not feeling\
  \ embarrassed. It was about becoming my best traveling buddy and embracing the world\
  \ around me. It was about allowing myself to get lost while searching for nothing\
  \ in particular."
