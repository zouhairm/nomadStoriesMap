Text: "Fifteen years ago, Kingston\u2019s inner-city suburb of Tivoli was a dangerous\
  \ place to be, day or night. It was ground zero for Jamaica\u2019s political warfare,\
  \ where the strong-arm tactics of gangs were enlisted to sway elections. It was\
  \ not uncommon for the area to be under the siege of gunfire. But all that changed\
  \ in 2003, when Oneil Miles set up speaker boxes on a street corner and started\
  \ playing music every Wednesday night. Passa Passa was born and it changed Tivoli\
  \ forever. Miles is the owner of the sound system Swatch International, a collective\
  \ of Tivoli DJs. In Jamaica, sound systems rule the roaring party scene, setting\
  \ the mood and determining the success (or otherwise) of songs. At the time Wednesday\
  \ nights on Kingston's otherwise busy nightlife circuit, were quiet. Miles\u2019\
  s intention was to bring the community together and take advantage of a gap in the\
  \ market. \n\nThe weekly gatherings started slowly, with a few Tivoli locals convening\
  \ to have a dance. But soon word got out. Tivoli's Wednesday nights began drawing\
  \ people from all quarters, including uptown Kingstonians, dancers, tourists, rough-necks,\
  \ pop stars and athletes. A dangerous ghetto transformed into a cacophonous alfresco\
  \ nightclub where people co-existed in a calm curated by music and dance. \n\nFor\
  \ visitors, Passa Passa delivers an authentic cultural experience. It\u2019s free,\
  \ outdoors and blaringly loud. The corner of Bread Lane and Spanish Town Road delivers\
  \ a high-energy block party; an unforgettable night of music, food and \u201Cwhining\u201D\
  \ (a provocative dance of the hips). But be prepared to stay up late. Technically,\
  \ the party starts on a Thursday at about 1am. \n\nAs I walk up to the intersection,\
  \ dancehall music, a fast-paced derivative of reggae, is booming from towers of\
  \ speaker boxes. The air is saturated with the smell of jerk chicken roasting in\
  \ steel drums. A buxom woman, wearing neon pink tights and huge gold earrings, dances\
  \ against a man cradling her hips with one hand and a cold Red Stripe beer with\
  \ the other. It is 3am when the crowds thicken and the DJ turns up a popular tune.\
  \ Everyone seems to sashay in formation to the same dance move, like a practised\
  \ choreography. It's mesmerising. \nI take in the diversity of the crowd as street\
  \ vendors selling everything from corn to candy vie for my attention. But I\u2019\
  m transfixed by the women. Their voluptuous curves beg to break free from skimpy\
  \ shorts and scanty tops, markers of dancehall fashion that require the level of\
  \ stratospheric confidence  innate to Jamaican women. They bounce intuitively on\
  \ tempo, showing off their mastery of the latest moves.\nThe DJ\u2019s console sits\
  \ inside a tuck shop, which by day sells bread and sundry. But on Passa Passa nights,\
  \ this is the DJ\u2019s throne. Dancing as he shifts the controls, he marshals the\
  \ crowd, shouting commentary in Jamaica\u2019s dialect, Patois, and playing a crafted\
  \ mix of dancehall and reggae that keeps the hypnotic energy high.\n\n \nI\u2019\
  m glad I know the moves to the next song as I step in sync with the man beside me.\
  \ A moment ago he was a stranger, but now as we move, we smile and share a moment.\
  \ It dawns on me that herein lies the power of Passa Passa. It unites disparate\
  \ people, enveloping them in an intoxicating all-night romp of music, movement and\
  \ intangible magic.\n\n\nIn Patois, \u201Cpassa passa\u201D means the stirring up\
  \ of excitement. And stirring things up is what it has done. It is credited with\
  \ reviving the street dance scene in Jamaica, now loaded with similar events such\
  \ as Weddi Weddi Wednesdays and Dutty Fridayz. Tour operators have started offering\
  \ street dance excursions to Kingston.\n\n\nFor me Passa Passa is what it always\
  \ intended to be, a one-of-a-kind night out in an area where I would usually never\
  \ venture. It is 7am when I decide to call it a night, or a morning, as it were.\
  \ The onset of commuter traffic seems to be the signal that the dancing is over.\
  \ I head to my car exhausted but happy, the taste of jerk chicken on my lips, the\
  \ sway of that last dance in my hips and a promise to myself to pass through Passa\
  \ Passa again."
