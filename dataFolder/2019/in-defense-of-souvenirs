Text: "The jean jacket emblazoned with sequined sleeves and a prominent unicorn drew\
  \ me to the store, but it was the poncho that kept me inside. It was a typical rain-resistant\
  \ poncho, like the ones you\u2019ve seen at Splash Mountain or Niagara Falls. Only\
  \ this poncho looked like a larger-than-life watermelon slice, made of 100% polyester\
  \ in an alarming shade of fuchsia, adorned with giant black \u201Cseeds\u201D. This\
  \ poncho was assertive. This poncho was alive. This poncho was not at all what I\
  \ had in mind when I set off to go souvenir shopping in the spiritual epicenter\
  \ of Bali. \n\nWhen we began packing for our four-month Southeast Asia adventure,\
  \ Brett and I agreed on three rules to ensure our 40L packs would still zip at the\
  \ end of the trip: \n1. Only pack essential clothing, which qualified as things\
  \ we\u2019d wear more than once a week. \n2. Two packing cubes per person, and all\
  \ clothing must fit inside. \n3. Unlike last time, he would categorically deny all\
  \ pleas to carry my bags. Whatever was mine was mine alone to carry, and so I should\
  \ pace my shopping accordingly. \n\nBut the poncho made me laugh! \n\nAnd not just\
  \ chuckle, it was full-on belly laughter. It sent twice the pain of sit-ups through\
  \ my core as I danced around the tiny shop, stopping to pose in front of every mirror\
  \ they had. I couldn\u2019t believe such a thing existed. And that I discovered\
  \ it amongst the Om singlets and singing bowls of Ubud\u2019s touristic facade.\n\
  \nRule Three indicated that I should have left the poncho on the hanger and continued\
  \ about our day. And so I did. We walked out of the store and into whatever Bali\
  \ wanted to share with us next.\n\nI shuffled down the cobblestone sidewalk, navigating\
  \ towards a coffee shop specializing in jamu (healing tonics) and waffle sundaes\
  \ that came highly recommended by a local. While simultaneous staring at my phone\
  \ and dodging the drum procession filling the street, the obvious happened. I stepped\
  \ heel-first into a puddle, causing the displaced water to splash all over my dress.\
  \ Yes, it was disgusting. But it was also a sign.\n\nFive minutes later I was back\
  \ inside the shop asking if they accepted American Express. \n\nI discovered three\
  \ important lessons in that first purchase, with which we have since replaced our\
  \ old rules: \n\nA souvenir should remind you of the unexpected.\nWe visit places\
  \ that have rich history and thus, associated expectations. But even the most predictable\
  \ places have something unexpected to offer. Try to find a souvenir that reminds\
  \ you of the surprise you uncovered. This will serve your nostalgia for the trip,\
  \ but also that of your own discovery. I will never forget that amongst the sea\
  \ of organic soap shops and yoga studios, there was a Balinese woman selling outrageous\
  \ hobby clothing far ahead of our time.\n\nA souvenir should remind you of how to\
  \ feel.\nMarkets will entice you with authentic farmer hats and jade energy rollers.\
  \ But you don\u2019t need culturally-appropriated devices to remind you or show\
  \ others where you\u2019ve been. A souvenir can remind you of how traveling made\
  \ you feel, of the days when you lived life light and easy. If a worthy possession\
  \ sparks joy, then a worthy souvenir sparks enlightenment. When I look at that poncho\
  \ in my closet, it will always remind me to laugh, no matter what.\n\nA souvenir\
  \ should be something you will actually use. If your souvenir is not an active part\
  \ of your life, the memories it holds will inevitably fade. A tchotchke that sits\
  \ on a dusty shelf, waiting for your mother to notice it and say \u201CI love this!\
  \ I saw the same one at HomeGoods!\u201D is one you may as well have bought at HomeGoods.\
  \ But something useful, like, say, a poncho on a rainy New York evening, can instantly\
  \ transport you from a damp subway station to tiered rice paddies. \n\nI still have\
  \ yet to wear the poncho, such is the blessing of Asia\u2019s perpetual sunshine.\
  \ But it has become my most beloved possession in my bursting backpack. The magnum\
  \ opus of my souvenir collection. Maybe\u2014hopefully\u2014tomorrow\u2019s forecast\
  \ will finally call for rain."
