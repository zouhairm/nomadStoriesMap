Text: "You can only travel to so many exotic places before facing the dreaded language\
  \ barrier, an overwhelming prospect even to well-worn travellers. For some people,\
  \ that alone is enough of a reason to keep their feet planted firmly on native-speaking\
  \ territory.\n\nUnderstandable, when the word 'backpacking' conjures thoughts of\
  \ standing at a bus stop, drenched in a mix of sweat and humidity, trying to interpret\
  \ foreign characters while a crowd of locals look on.\n\nHowever, more often than\
  \ not, one of the weathered faces will break into a smile and ask in university-level\
  \ English whether you need any help. (Well, it's usually that old man's grandson\
  \ who asks.)\n\nI'm very thankful to natively speak what has become the international\
  \ language for tourism, but it's the times my English is met with a blank stare\
  \ when I learn the most about myself and people more broadly.\n\nStripping communication\
  \ back to the minimum of shared language also sheds new light on my own mother tongue\
  \ and the idiosyncrasies we ignore in day-to-day conversation. Maybe \"by train\"\
  \ is a very appropriate answer to the question \"how are you going today?\"\n\n\
  Although it can feel alienating, the flip-side of it is peace. Even in a bustling\
  \ Asian megacity there is an odd twist of serenity when the words of every person\
  \ you brush shoulders with simply drift past your ear. And after returning home,\
  \ I found myself frustrated as my brain tuned in to the inane chit-chat of every\
  \ person who passed me by.\n\nThat's not to say there won't be times when the language\
  \ barrier causes an issue\u2026\n\nPicture this: It's late afternoon on a palm tree\
  \ lined, rural beach in the Philippines. Children laugh and squeal in the distance\
  \ as they toy with the lapping waves. (Now picture that same beach with a good dose\
  \ of washed-up plastic scattered across it: that's just the world we've created\
  \ and now have to live in, folks).\n\nNonetheless, after a hot walk down a gravel\
  \ road past homes with empty, makeshift shopfronts, a quick dip is just the reward\
  \ we need. But within minutes of wading in, a sharp pain fires in the bottom of\
  \ my foot.\n\nI wince at my girlfriend, who turns pale in response. Unspoken, we\
  \ both know the nearest hospital is hours away, and despite being from Australia\
  \ -- the land of all things poisonous -- we have no idea what lurks in these shallows.\n\
  \nBattling the (inch high) waves, I hobble out of the water and collapse on the\
  \ sand. On my heel we find about a dozen dark purple spots. My life flashes before\
  \ my eyes as my girlfriend whips out her phone to consult Dr Google, but the reception\
  \ is about as effective as that of a real doctors' waiting room --overdue for an\
  \ appointment with no doctor in sight.\n\nI look around for somebody to help and\
  \ spot a man with his young boy dragging a net and bucket back from the shallows.\
  \ \"He must be the local marine biologist,\" I think, optimistically.\n\nGetting\
  \ his attention he walks over slowly, despite our obvious panic. \"Do you know what\
  \ this is, will I be okay?\" I ask.\n\nHis reply: \"No, no. Tomorrow, is over.\"\
  \n\nAfter some repetition, we found vague reassurance that he meant the pain, and\
  \ not my life. Once we reached town, we indeed were able to confirm that sea urchin\
  \ stings are harmless.\n\nBy reducing our communication to the most basic elements,\
  \ it accentuates our similarities, not our differences. And at the end of the day,\
  \ we're all trying to say the same thing: \"which bus goes to the airport?\""
