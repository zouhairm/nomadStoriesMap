Text: "Things the internet told me before I visited Bali -\n\n1. Indonesia an archipelago\
  \ with more than 1000 islands, also a part of the very vulnerable region called\
  \ \"Ring of Fire\". And Bali is it's tourism capital.\n\n2. Ubud is the \"it\" place\
  \ to be.\n\n3. Beware of scams at money changer.\n\n4. Uber works everywhere.\n\n\
  5. People are nice and hospitable.\n\n6. We can get eggs cooked in lava from Mt.\
  \ Batur.\n\n7. Seasickness is in the mind.\n\n8. It is beautiful.\n\nThings I learned\
  \ after spending 11 days there -\n\n1. Mt. Batur trek starts at 2:30 AM and we don't\
  \ get eggs cooked in the lava (it's dormant). Also, do not wear your favorite Nike\
  \ trainers because downhill descend is basically gliding down the volcano surface,\
  \ somewhat like skateboarding without the actual skateboards, or even braking.\n\
  \n2. Ubud is definitely the \"it\" place but there are things beyond \"it\". Go\
  \ outside it, to the Nusa Islands, Gilli, anywhere. They are breathtaking.\n\n3.\
  \ Not every third person is a scam artist. However every 10th might be, so be safe\
  \ and go to an authorized money changer and count your money. \n\n4. Add three zeroes\
  \ to everything while shopping. If they say 200, it's 200,000. Don't panic though!\
  \ 1USD is almost 14500 IDR so you are not really denting your pockets, yet.\n\n\
  5. Uber does not work everywhere, in fact it works nowhere. Grab taxi might be an\
  \ alternate but local taxi drivers want monopoly so that too is not available everywhere.\
  \ Rent a scooter/car.\n\n6. And if you do decide to rent a scooter please check\
  \ distances to the sights you are planning to visit on it. Do not blindly fill your\
  \ tanks and just go with the flow. Use google maps, unless you want sore bums for\
  \ the rest of your trip.\n\n7. Durian is overrated for people who grew up on fermented\
  \ fish. But have you tried Magosteen? Well I would say if you wish to go home with\
  \ the sweet memory of an exotic fruit, skip the durian, try the steen! It is truly\
  \ Indonesian.\n\n8. Seasickness is very real and do not get on a boat without remedies\
  \ if you are tragically motion sensitive. And no matter what do not sit facing the\
  \ opposite direction of the boat's motion! (Lemons help miraculously)\n\n9. Scuba\
  \ diving will change you. Either you will fall in love or you will regret spending\
  \ every pence of your dollar in it. My advise, be brave.\n\n10. Indonesians take\
  \ their religion very seriously. They respect their traditions and demand that of\
  \ anyone who visits them. Buy a sarong and scarf.\n\n11. If you are thinking of\
  \ going off the Bali island towards remote areas, be prepared for a lot less English,\
  \ a lot more sign language, bad roads and getting lost. But if you stay calm and\
  \ smile a lot, people are more than willing to help, even through animated signing.\n\
  \n12. If you plan to go to Nusa Cenningan and hear about a beautiful place called\
  \ Secret beach, there is a reason why they call it a secret - nobody knows about\
  \ it. And I mean that literally, NOBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. Don't ask how much time\
  \ I spent looking for it. \n\n13. Firangipani is not just a flower in Indonesia,\
  \ it's like their culture, beautiful and fragrant.\n\n14. Lastly, I had heard a\
  \ lot about Indonesian cuisine and tried a lot of local food at the \"Warungs\"\
  \ I came across and by lots let's just say Bak-so became a staple for me. But everything\
  \ there came with a pinch of sugar and that is what my biggest experience has been.\
  \ \n\nIndonesia is a lot of things, experiences, challenges but all, with a pinch\
  \ of sugar in it. And don't we all agree a pinch of sugar (a drop of honey for the\
  \ health conscious ones here, if any)  makes everything slightly better to be?"
