Text: "The sound of the engine woke me up. It was the first bus stop, and the driver\
  \ called the passengers to get their baggage. I felt the calm summer breeze on my\
  \ face, making my heart smile and my eyes sparkle. No place is like an open road.\n\
  We were all there for a different reason, on our own journey. Old woman smiling\
  \ back at her husband, as they embark on yet another new adventure. Woman with her\
  \ little daughter having fun as best friends. Families excited for their summer\
  \ vacation to a well-known destination. In the shadow, apart from the noise and\
  \ the excitement, there was I - a lonely passenger looking at others from distance.\
  \ It was the first time ever that I decided to spontaneously dive into a new experience\
  \ on my own.\_\nMy adventurous spirit, wanderer mind, and introvert nature made\
  \ the decision easier. The closed-minded, prejudiced surrounding surely helped.\
  \ How outrageous, unacceptable and disapproving it is for a woman to travel alone?\
  \ I wasn't aware until I shared the idea. The simple act of traveling in the sake\
  \ of exploration and enjoyment is not encouraged, even though statistically women\
  \ travel alone far more than men do. Women must have a reasonable explanation of\
  \ why would they do such a thing. These unfounded beliefs made my decision clear.\n\
  Seeking for far more than the ordinary, one morning I started exploring an unsettled\
  \ direction. I walked with mixed unpleasant feelings, people strangely staring at\
  \ me on the forsaken road that I hoped led somewhere. With the cars stopping by\
  \ I realized that maybe people were right about the safety part. But then again,\
  \ that happens all the time no matter where you are. I thought about going back,\
  \ but long gone was my comfort zone and my legs just ran on, guided by my intuition.\
  \ I ran until there were no more people in the sight. With the indescribable heaviness\
  \ of discomfort, longing for silence, running to escape my thoughts. In an instant,\
  \ it all came back to me. All my insecurities and forgotten doubts were on the road\
  \ with me. The search for meaning and deeper validation in this shallow world kept\
  \ me going. As a hill emerged before me I knew I had to climb it, not even thinking\
  \ that I had to remember the way back. I was never sure about something in my life\
  \ as that day, about that particular path. That path that challenged every part\
  \ of me, making me question my own existence, character, all my excuses, values,\
  \ dreams, insecurities, and fears. It made me leave everything that weighted me\
  \ down, filling me with excitement about life.\_\nIn a moment of exhaustion, with\
  \ the last breath and misty view, \u200AI finally saw the magnificent ancient Platamon\
  \ castle. Suddenly everything felt perfectly into place. My imperfect victory. The\
  \ sense of rediscovered freedom. All alone, standing on the top of the ruins that\
  \ were once a castle. So appealing, I was soaking up the magnificent view from the\
  \ top. My exhaustion switched to amazement. In that simple moment of gratitude,\
  \ my walls became ruins. As I breathed in the fresh air I closed my eyes and realized\
  \ I wasn't the same person that got on that bus. This battle was for no one but\
  \ me. That was my learning season and I finally came back to myself. Like I was\
  \ in a car that suddenly decided to turn in an unknown direction, taking me on a\
  \ road that instantly captivated all of me. The sun over Platamon set me at peace.\
  \ It taught me how to enjoy the little things in life, how to make a memory that\
  \ lasts a lifetime and reminded me that I am capable of almost everything. It gave\
  \ me confidence and made me so proud of myself.\nEvery little victory since then,\
  \ I owe to you \u200A-\u200A painfully rewarding coast of Platamon.\n\"So, you really\
  \ came here all by yourself? I could never travel alone. You are so brave for doing\
  \ this.\"\nAnd I just smiled."
