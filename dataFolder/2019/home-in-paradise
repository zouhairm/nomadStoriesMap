Text: "The minibus stopped at it's stand. I quickly jumped off, leaving my friends\
  \ bewildered and wondering. I shout out to them that i would meet them at the planned\
  \ location in a few days. With that, the van sped off. The engines rattling loudly.\
  \ Around me I notice the market vendors. A grand array of tropical fruits, root\
  \ crops and sea food that is all too familiar to me. Each market vendor was packing\
  \ up unsold produce while still trying to sell off some at more then reduced prices.\
  \ The market awnings a dull shade of yellow and blue in the last light of day. \n\
  \nAlone. Scared, but excited. Adventure! \n\nThe next day we made our way up into\
  \ the valleys. The Sigatoka valley also known as the \"Salad bowl of Fiji\". It\
  \ did not ooze the typical things Fiji is known for. There was more mystery and\
  \ anticipation to our days activities. How I had lived in Fiji all my life and not\
  \ visited this place was beyond me. More then 2 hours drive from Suva, the capital\
  \ of Fiji. A place that will linger in your memory years after you've felt its beauty.\
  \ \n\nThe trip up the valley to the village of \"Mavua\" was breathtaking. Children\
  \ from neighbouring villages frolicked by the river banks. Naked, treading water\
  \ and throwing pebbles. Some raced down the river , waving at us and shouting \"\
  Moce\"(bye). Women lugged their laundry to the river and washed them on big rocks,\
  \ later beating them with wooden bats and rinsing them in the cool waters. A game\
  \ of rugby ensues nearby. You're not in Fiji if you don't witness rugby at least\
  \ 6 days of the week. \n\nFurther up, i noticed black cliffs towering over the river.\
  \ It looked majestic. The sun softly kissed the the soft peaks of the rivers ripples\
  \ and it glistened. The dense woodlands gave the valleys more grandeur. This was\
  \ Fiji, in all its ever green glory. \n\nUpon arrival at the village of \"Mavua\"\
  , we were ushered into the village hall. Here the traditional formalities took place.\
  \ The \"yaqona\" or \"kava\" is presented to the head of the village of the chief.\
  \ This is the root of the plant scientifically called the Piper methysticum. The\
  \ root is pounded till it becomes powder. It is then mxed with water to be consumed.\
  \ It is customary in Fiji to present this to village elders or chiefs when you are\
  \ visiting their village for the first time. This presentation is known as the \"\
  sevusevu\". It is akin to asking for their permission and blessings on your presence\
  \ in the village. This formality will also include partaking in the drinking of\
  \ kava, that has already been prepared by the village men. It is quite a solemn\
  \ few minutes when the first few bowls of kava are given to a few men according\
  \ to their standing in the village. The visitors are then offered kava also, after\
  \ which it literally becomes a social drink. \n\nAfter the formalities, dancing\
  \ and merry making took place. Villagers placed the \"salusalu\" around the visitors\
  \ necks. \"Salusalu\" is Fiji's version of a garland or lei. Talc or powder as it\
  \ is more commonly known in Fiji was then used sparingly on people's hair and faces.\
  \ This was done by villagers to the visiting party mostly in celebration and happiness.\
  \ There was a lot of dancing which is something I was used to. The visitors stay\
  \ for a few hours interacting with the villagers, eating  exploring the village\
  \ and enjoying a few more bowls of kava, which can start to have a numbing effect\
  \ and make you feel a bit drowsy. \n\nAfter disembarking. I was fortunate enough\
  \ to be taken on a ride by a good friend of mine who stayed around the area. I stood\
  \ in the tractor, holding one to the tractors bars and we made our way along the\
  \ dirt road. The vegetation was so lush, starting from the roads and ending by the\
  \ river banks. Cattle grazed. People tended to their farms. The valleys was way\
  \ more then I expected. There I was, confirming the fact, that Fiji was definitely\
  \ the way the world should be."
