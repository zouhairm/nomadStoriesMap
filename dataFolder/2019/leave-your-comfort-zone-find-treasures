Text: "Why travelling is fascinating? No doubt, the list to answer this would be never-ending.\
  \ Besides discovering is always exciting, exploring the unknown pulls us to learn\
  \ about new cultures, expand our vision and develop ourselves. If you have the courage\
  \ to step outside your comfort zone and move towards the unknown, life will be grateful\
  \ and will give you the greatest experience ever.\n\nLet me share one of my latest\
  \ adventures. Recently, I spent two amazing weeks in Ecuador with a local friend.\
  \ Although I was far from being well-prepared when I arrived, I felt safe in the\
  \ good hands of my friend, lucky me. He was happy to be our program planner and\
  \ I happily followed him.\nSo I did on that day in Ba\xF1os. I didn\xB4t bother\
  \ much about knowing our plans in detail, I was ready to go with the flow.\n\nIt\
  \ was a beautiful, sunny day when we started with a 20-km-bicycle tour to visit\
  \ the famous waterfall called El Pailon del Diablo. Our journey led us among mountains\
  \ with breathtaking views, fresh air and sunshine warming our face. What is so special\
  \ about a bike ride? Well, we stepped it up.\n\nOur first stop was at a zip-line\
  \ station, my first chance to challenge the border of my courage zone. If you are\
  \ not familiar with the concept, neither I was, you \u201Cfly\u201D over giant canyons\
  \ on a cable stretched between two points of different heights. At this place you\
  \ have the possibility to fly 300 meters at a height of 200 meters, with rivers\
  \ and waterfalls below you. The idea scared the living daylights out of me.\n\n\
  Once we departed, I lost all fear and just enjoyed every single moment of my first\
  \ flying experience. I observed all details of the landscape from a completely new\
  \ perspective, bird\xB4s eye view. It was mind-blowing!\n\nTaking advantage of my\
  \ friend\xB4s regional expertise, we looked for the lama who lived in the area.\
  \ A new friendship was born. Such a playful lama he was, I took a few minutes to\
  \ be brave enough to hug my new friend. Can you imagine the feeling when a 130 kg\
  \ lama jumps on you trying to bite you from pure love? Speechless.\n\nThe waterfall\
  \ was indeed spectacular, a great body of water failing incredible fast with incredible\
  \ potency. We took a rest before the upcoming adventure, the third dare for today.\n\
  \nCanyoning includes different activities to work our way down waterfall canyons.\
  \ I am not particularly a \u201Cwater girl\u201D and had never tried adventure sports\
  \ before, so I went straight into a panic when faced with the exercise\u2026\n\n\
  Soon my turn came, I took a deep breath and started to climb step by step holding\
  \ myself to the cable, in the waterfall, in parallel position with the stones. When\
  \ I arrived without any accident, I was so satisfied that in my happiness, I did\
  \ not realize a nearby hole where I obviously fell, oops. Did not care about the\
  \ awkwardness, the sense of achievement was overwhelming! The next round seemed\
  \ to be more challenging, tobogganing in a waterfall. I completed it with no incidents\
  \ and even enjoyed it. However, I refused the third activity, rappelling. This literally\
  \ meant leaping into the unknown from a high rock into the abyss! Leaving your comfort\
  \ zone is one thing, but doing something that freaks you out is another. Know your\
  \ limits, broaden it step by step.\n\nTo summarize, this day gave me unforgettable\
  \ moments, I felt extremely delighted to overcome a few fears and gained stunning\
  \ experiences by doing activities I might not have tried if I had known in advance\
  \ and without my supportive friend. The twist of the story? I was not only struggling\
  \ with mental strain but also with my physical condition. The night before I got\
  \ a terrible stomach flu, spent the whole night in the company of the toilet bowl\
  \ having the sensation of being in the third world war. Despite of all the inconveniences,\
  \ I made it!\n\nThe unknown sometimes puts you into unpleasant situations. I still\
  \ firmly believe \u201CLife begins at the end of your comfort zone\u201D. My advice\
  \ is to live it. Are you ready?"
