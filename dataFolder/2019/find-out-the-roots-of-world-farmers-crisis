Text: "Despite being a agrarian country, India is facing food grains crisis along\
  \ with entire world. India has agriculture based economy and this is the most pathetic\
  \ situation that India's one of the most fertile areas like Bundelkhand and Vidarbh\
  \ region is facing acute farmer's distress due to agrarian crisis, since last two\
  \ decades. In India, Bundelkhand region is become infamous for farmer's suicide\
  \ and in between this, two most positive achievements created ray of hope for entire\
  \ country to overcome this crisis. one is a progressive farmer's positive and solution\
  \ providing approach towards farming sector and another one is German woman journalist\
  \ working for village development campaign through unique child education program\
  \ in a far remote tribal village in Bundelkhand region. \nProgressive Farmer Prem\
  \ Singh has evolved a concept of farming named \"Periodical Agriculture\" based\
  \ upon his two decades experiment, which provides the way of farming in most adverse\
  \ circumstances. This formula gives a way of sustainable and inclusive agriculture\
  \ pattern for coming generations. Developed countries agriculture experts and students\
  \ is curiously coming to know this pattern for adoption as a way of life and for\
  \ research purpose also. \nGerman Journalist and traveler Ulrike Rheinhard has started\
  \ unique kids education program in tribal village of Bundelkhand. She is doing social\
  \ empowerment through child education with the help of sports. She started skate\
  \ park in this village and make it India's 6th skate park as canter of attraction\
  \ for tourists as well as for educationists. Kids has learning skate boarding with\
  \ compulsory school going condition. This condition jumped  attendance rate of students\
  \ in school and due this social change State govt. signed a memorandum of understanding\
  \ with this lady to expend this program in other schools also. \nSo these two success\
  \ stories could be high lighten before the world. I am planning to travel these\
  \ two places, situated in India's most backward area in Bundelkhand."
