Text: "If you are looking forward to diving into the Middle Age then there is no better\
  \ place than Albaicin - Granada's unique old quarter. The decision to visit Andalucia\
  \ and particularly Granada last summer was triggered long ago by Washington Irving's\
  \ famous collection of verbal sketches 'Tales of the Alhambra',  which I read when\
  \ I was twelve. \n\nAnd here I was, all by myself heading to my hipster Airbnb,\
  \ cursing at my silly decision to accommodate in the old town and to bring my experience\
  \ closer to the one the Moorish ruler Boabdil could have had in the fourteenth century\
  \ while strolling the narrow streets of Albaicin. Actually, I was obsessed with\
  \ this guy who died somewhere in Morocco after he got defeated by Spaniards. Boabdil's\
  \ love for his city inspired a number of writers and artists; however, I wanted\
  \ to have the love affair with this peculiar cocktail made of North African beguiling\
  \ vibes and passionate flamenco tunes. \n\nThere were only 3 days to enjoy my stay\
  \ and to decipher the puzzle constructed in my head thanks to Mr Irving. My main\
  \ area of discovery was Albaicin that I dissected into three 'barrios' or hoods.\
  \ Challenged by July's scorching sun, lack of air and shadow, I braved to have the\
  \ picturesque stroll of Paseo de Los Tristes along the river Darro, which could\
  \ be translated as 'The walk of the sad ones'. My guidebook would not explain much,\
  \ therefore instead of just reading the scarce information I decided to have a glass\
  \ of refreshing local white wine in the Tabernilla del Darro - the cosiest tavern\
  \ you would probably find in the whole area. Sipping on my delicious local Mencal,\
  \ accompanied by a teeny tiny bowl of green olives and a piece of flavoursome goat\
  \ cheese, I started writing my letters to Boabdil, not exactly the love letters\
  \ but something more academical, questioning his love for the city and building\
  \ up crazy hypotheses. Suddenly, out of the blue, a waitress named Rosario who just\
  \ started her shift came towards me and with a fine curiosity in her eyes asked\
  \ me whether I am a writer. Flabbergasted, delighted or merely surprised I couldn't\
  \ tell what I felt that very moment, but nonetheless Rosario happened to be the\
  \ key to all of my unresolved issues with Boabdil. It was my first night in Granada\
  \ and I already had an ally to battle against the unknown.\n\nMy second day started\
  \ with a 'cafe con leche', Spanish tomato toast and Rosario's sweet stories about\
  \ Granada at Trinidad's square. My new friend gave a brief overview of the Moorish\
  \ Dynasties that ruled Granada and after hearing my true reason of visiting the\
  \ city, she invited me for a short walk the result of which was my brief encounter\
  \ with Sir Washington Irving or to be more precise with his venerable statue. Right\
  \ after this short rendezvous, we headed from the low Albacin to the second area\
  \ called San Miguel Bajo. It took us some thirty minutes walking up the hill but\
  \ every step and every drop of my sweat was worth it. The square was peacefully\
  \ resting, orange trees were crowned with the fruit from the previous harvest and\
  \ a lovely elderly man sitting just next to the entrance of his house kneading his\
  \ basket. An idyllic image that still lives in my brain. Our next stop was San Miguel\
  \ Alto, the highest sightseeing spot of the city, where we enjoyed the views and\
  \ the silence. The maze of the little streets, the hidden squares, up the hill,\
  \ down the hill, heavy breathing, Rosario's short but vivid tales, tapas and wine,\
  \ more wine, flamenco fusion and unexpectedly the night had come.\n\nMy third day\
  \ wasn't that eventful. I stayed in my 'carmen', a flat that once belonged to a\
  \ numerous Andalusian family, and tried to compose another letter to Boabdil. And\
  \ it all made sense. The spicy smell of Albaicin, the silence, the local hospitality\
  \ - everything triggered just one emotion - being at peace."
