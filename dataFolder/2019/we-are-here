Text: "There I was, a city girl in a sub-village in the middle of nowhere. Sub-village.\
  \ It means more remote than its village. No cellular signal reception, no electricity\
  \ except for a few dim lightbulbs in the evening, no bathroom, no clean water to\
  \ wash up.\n\nSeveral friends and relatives wondered why I would want to go to a\
  \ far-flung place like Mentawai Islands in West Sumatra. I shrugged. I was just\
  \ eager to explore parts of Indonesia that I have not been before.\n\nTo reach this\
  \ sub-village within the Siberut rainforest, I joined a trip package along with\
  \ six other Indonesian travellers. We took a traditional wooden motorboat from the\
  \ southern part of Siberut Island, voyaging through the river for four hours in\
  \ one cloudy afternoon. The river width range was 25 to 45 feet, with murky light\
  \ brown water. Our two guides asserted there were no crocodiles. Great.\n\nThe small\
  \ motorboat was 30 inches wide, with single seats of wooden panels where nine of\
  \ us sitting in a vertical row, almost crouching, with our legs crossed and trying\
  \ not to make sudden movements to keep the boat floating in balance. Adding the\
  \ fun, there were no life jackets. I should not be surprised.\n\nWe were going to\
  \ spend two nights at a traditional house called 'uma', which was made of woods.\
  \ The roof was partly layered with sago palm leaves. The main house had a 30 feet\
  \ wide porch and extended to a space that functioned as both living and dining rooms.\
  \ Entering the doorway to the rear part of the house, there was one bedroom and\
  \ a large kitchen with a big fireplace and plenty of well-worn cooking wares. The\
  \ porch and the kitchen were decorated with skulls of various animals hunted by\
  \ the homeowner, such as boar and monkey. The more the skulls, the higher the social\
  \ status of the family in the tribe.\n\nWe introduced ourselves to the hosts, Mr.\
  \ and Mrs. Am. I think they were in their mid-40s. Their youngest son was still\
  \ studying in the village\u2019s only elementary school, an hour walking distance\
  \ through a muddy road. The couple were farmers, selling fruits and crops they could\
  \ grow on their land. They were not earning much. The statistics labelled the villagers\
  \ as eligible recipients of government assistance. We were touched when the snacks\
  \ and biscuits we brought for the family were treated as a luxury.\n\nThat evening,\
  \ we sat on the floor mat at the porch-slash-dining-room where dinner was being\
  \ served. Closest neighbours, whom were related to Mr. Am, attended the welcome\
  \ dinner. A guest of honour, the tribe\u2019s 'sikerei', was also present. Mr. Am\
  \ explained that a 'sikerei' is the shaman and has supernatural abilities. A 'sikerei'\
  \ is barefooted, only wears a cloth belting his private parts and ethnic accessories\
  \ on his head, neck, and wrists. The body of a 'sikerei' is covered with the ancient\
  \ Mentawai tattoos.\n\n\u201CIn the past, the military forced our elders to wear\
  \ clothes. They\u2019d beat us,\u201D Mr. Am opened up a grim tale from our 32-year\
  \ authoritarian era between the 70s and the 90s. The villagers, other than the 'sikereis',\
  \ wear \u2018proper\u2019 clothes now, although Mr. Am seemed more comfortable without\
  \ his shirt.\n\nHe continued, \u201Cwe\u2019re now also Muslims, Christians, Catholics.\
  \ Doesn\u2019t matter. There\u2019s no conflict here, we live in harmony. But we\
  \ also have to preserve our ancient beliefs and traditions.\u201D\n\nWe sat in silence\
  \ for a moment. There were us, the \u2018city people\u2019, came to hear the stories\
  \ of our own fellow countrymen who are struggling to maintain their indigenous identities.\
  \ They are not \u2018nowhere\u2019. They are there.\n\nI knew then why I visited\
  \ this place."
