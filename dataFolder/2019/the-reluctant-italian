Text: "Many travel stories have prologues. Mine began many years ago on a cold, Melbourne,\
  \ winter night in an old cinema. One of those cinemas where the seats are uncomfortable,\
  \ the red velvet curtains tatty and fairly heaving across the screen and the ambience\
  \ hints of a tawdry past. It was the perfect backdrop for The Leopard. \n\nThe Leopard\
  \ is considered Italy\u2019s Gone With The Wind, set in Sicily in the last, heady\
  \ days before Italy was finally unified. So just what did this film based on a novel\
  \ written by a Sicilian, impoverished Prince (who did not live to see it published)\
  \ and directed by the redoubtable Luchino Visconti, a wealthy Count, a Communist,\
  \ a Catholic and a homosexual (all the contradictions of Italy rolled into one)\
  \ have to do with me?\n\nSicily for me has always been a catch in my throat and\
  \ a tear in my eye, there is Mediterranean drama right there! I am the daughter\
  \ of Sicilan immigrants, the perpetual insider/ outsider, a reluctant Italian. Sitting\
  \ in the dark, the film brought Sicily back to me, a place I had not visited in\
  \ years. All at once I felt the incessant heat and the interminable dust\u2026it\
  \ was an atavistic experience where I connected with the paradoxes of Sicily, you\
  \ think you have grasped it and then all meaning eludes you.  It would take me on\
  \ many journeys, within and without.\n\nFast forward and I am in Palermo, land of\
  \ The Leopard. It is a balmy summer evening and I am strolling through the streets\
  \ with no favoured direction in mind just looking for a place to dine.  The streets\
  \ are deserted, the restaurants and bars vacant. What am I missing here? What joke\
  \ am I not in on? I finally settle on a restaurant that contains a few patrons and\
  \ pluck up the courage to ask in my scratchy Italian where everyone was. It was\
  \ the World Cup and Italy was playing their first match. They drew with Paraguay\
  \ 1-1. \n\nFortunately later on that evening the streets filled up with people.\
  \ I weaved around them, through the cobbled, narrow alleys ways where people spilled\
  \ out. I visited many a bar and conducted a sort of awed surveillance, as I let\
  \ the wine take over. There were the tacky ones, the bronzed, leathery, ones dripping\
  \ in gold, gesticulating with their wayward cigarette, the fancy ones, the faded\
  \ aristocrats, all talking over each other, fabulous!  You try and find the same\
  \ bars the evening after but they seem to have disappeared, I am convinced these\
  \ are revolving alleys, fleeting except in your memory.\n\nAnother evening I tried\
  \ to inconspicuously listen in on a group of men who I was convinced were mobbed\
  \ up. Straight from central casting these gents, they looked like they were ready\
  \ to dine on the flesh of young animals. Please let them order suckling pig, I thought\
  \ but alas very prosaic pizza was served. I\u2019m sure if I yelled out \u201CPeppe,\
  \ Ciccio, Turidu, Saro!\u201D They would all turn around. There would be no excellent\
  \ cadavers here.\n\nAnother night I wandered through the back streets near the infamous\
  \ market place, la Vuccuria. I saw the burnt out bombed buildings, from World War\
  \ 2. No one had ever bothered to rebuild them. To me they were a reminder of the\
  \ many reversals of fortune Palermo and indeed Sicily had seen. The countless invasions,\
  \ it is interesting to note that the Sicilian dialect does not contain a future\
  \ sense, how could they if they were never sure of their fate?\n\nI actually met\
  \ a descendant of the Last Leopard. We spoke in his home, it had been destroyed\
  \ in the war but thankfully restored. He was a melancholy soul and he regaled me\
  \ with recollections of old Palermo and the ghosts he lives with. He is the custodian\
  \ of the novel, The Leopard and its memories. The character of Tancredi was based\
  \ on him. I seemed to catch that melancholy as I set out again in the Palermo day.\
  \ The heat and the blue sky both stifle and dazzle. Flanked by sea and mountains\
  \ and endless possibilities, still the patina of defeat and joy always abound."
