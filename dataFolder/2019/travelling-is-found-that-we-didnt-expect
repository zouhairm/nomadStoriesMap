Text: "It was a journey to one of the famous city. It is Aceh, when I say Aceh we\
  \ always remember about the biggest Tsunami hit in Aceh the day after Christmas\
  \ on December 26th 2004. The victim in Aceh is the largest victim in this boxing\
  \ day tsunamis from among 14 countries. \nI have an opportunity to visited Aceh\
  \ on 2010, 6 years after Tsunami. My concern when I visited Aceh it was not about\
  \ the Tsunami but as a city that adhered to Islamic Law (Syariah Islam) and knowing\
  \ as a sister city with Makah, Arab. Their culture, their law, and their life is\
  \ a referring to Makah. So, I am thinking about how I should dress since a Muslim\
  \ woman should using the hijab and long dress cover all the body. Well, I prepared\
  \ so many pashmina and long hand clothes, I was born not to be broken heart traveler\
  \ because Syariah officer drove me away as soon as I landed in Aceh. I am not alone\
  \ on this trip, we traveled we a group of 10 peoples. \nIt was a safe landed in\
  \ Banda Aceh and my heart was not broken heart since we passed the checking in the\
  \ airport, even I didn\u2019t use hijab. \nFrom the airport, we directly went to\
  \ a ferry terminal Ulee lhee and destination to Balohan (Sabang). From Banda Aceh\
  \ to Sabang with Ferry it took 2 hours, and we enjoyed the journey with the story\
  \ about how Tsunami hit this ocean. As for our information Sabang is the worst area\
  \ in Aceh that hit by Tsunami. \nBack to about Aceh as an Islamic law area, I am\
  \ still not using hijab even almost the people in the ferry used hijab in their\
  \ head but fortunately they didn\u2019t give it attention to me. It was really surprised\
  \ me since I was expected to find the Islamic law is adhered in here.\nAt the morning,\
  \ I was run around Sabang and found a local \u2018Chinese descent spouse\u2019 run\
  \ with me and the woman not using a Muslim dress so I asked them about the Islamic\
  \ Law. Well, they said it is not applicable for non-Muslim but we still have to\
  \ use an appropriate dress, and try to respect the Law even you are not Muslim.\n\
  Well, it was kill my expectation about Aceh. At the first I thought i will not make\
  \ it to Aceh since I am not a Muslim. Secondly, I was found, nothing is happening\
  \ if you are not try. \nSo, traveling is about give it a try and feel new experience.\
  \ Sometimes we found that we didn\u2019t expect."
