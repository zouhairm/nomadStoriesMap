Text: "I don\u2019t know where it all began, maybe when you make that tattoo in my\
  \ chest, near the school gym; maybe that day we decided to go travelling all along\
  \ the USA, and I remember your eyes in front of the blinding lights of New York,\
  \ I remember the day when we fell In love, in Louisiana, it\u2019s was April 1992.\
  \ \nI remember when we left in spite of all, hands in hands, on Santa Monica\u2019\
  s pier, the sand below our feets, the blues sang down in New Orleans, the infinite\
  \ harvest, in Mississippi, the long walks by the bridge, by the river. I didn\u2019\
  t expecting you going away from me, from our story, from the story we supposed to\
  \ told together. But you did, and now I only have a Polaroid, each one tells us\
  \ a story, maybe a story that we still have to invent. And I miss the sunsets, I\
  \ miss you saying: \u201Cmaybe we can go to Alaska, spring is starting\u201D; al\
  \ the clocks stopped when you said, in Chicago: \u201CI have to come back, real\
  \ life has to start\u201D. I was surrounded by thoughts, too much to say by words,\
  \ and all I had was that tattoo, made in Baton Rouge, you looked at the girl and\
  \ you asked: \u201Clady, please, made us together, and write down Louisiana 1992\u201D\
  . She did, on my shoulder, something indelible, the thing that keep us together,\
  \ above everything, along the USA, along our love trip, along our love and nothing\
  \ else."
