Text: "Sweat was dripping down my face as the lunch break was called. We dropped our\
  \ shovels, looked up and smiled joyfully at each other. Three kilometers of trench\
  \ line was dug and with only two kilometers to go we knew tomorrow the water line\
  \ could be installed. I called out to Brad, \u201Clet's go on a walk!\u201D So we\
  \ left the group, set off on foot down the main village road in Mabare Uganda, and\
  \ took a leap into the unknown. The mountain contours rose and fell sitting high\
  \ in the crisp blue sky. Birds flew over head with ease and banana tree leaves shook\
  \ slightly with each passing breeze. We walked down the dusty red clay road, stopping\
  \ to capture the beauty. A local called out to us, as he leaned on a tree stump,\
  \ \u201Cwant to see my fields?\u201D I turned to Brad with a questioning look on\
  \ my face and received a curious nod from him in response. We turned in to join\
  \ the man. With a warm spirit he welcomed us like friends, and we all began to walk\
  \ down a thin footpath. We passed through loose cattle, pigs, and of course armies\
  \ of ants. The path went on gaining and losing elevation. We passed through backyards\
  \ and small patches of forest. We got to his house finally, and then kept walking.\
  \ A deep feeling in my gut raised the question, where are we going? No one knows\
  \ we took off for lunch. Step after step we tromped down the mountainside, climbed\
  \ over a large fallen tree, and jumped a small stream. Before I knew it we arrived.\
  \ The fields were lush with growing pineapples, skyscrapers of sugarcane, and large\
  \ banana trees dangled ripening fruit under a canopy of wide splitting leaves that\
  \ branched out towards one another. I was struck with awe. We ventured over to the\
  \ sloping hillside of pineapple plants and sat down among the prickly bushes. Baby\
  \ pineapples grew from the center, larger ones protruded the spiky vegetation and\
  \ ripe fruits shown with golden brown skin. Our new friend unhinged a machete off\
  \ his hip and cut the fruit right off the stalk. I captured photos of him delicately\
  \ slicing off the bristled ochre skin while holding tightly to the crown. Once the\
  \ bursting golden fruit was naked, he handed the whole pineapple over. My teeth\
  \ sunk right in. Taste buds exploding with ecstasy as my mind unraveled this unforeseen\
  \ encounter. The next golden fruit went to Brad, and the third to our new friend.\
  \ We chattered about his fields and life in the village, and then went in for another\
  \ round! Fresh juices dripped out of the side of my mouth and ran down my chin.\
  \ The taste was phenomenal and incomparable to any pineapple I'd ever tasted. Unparalleled\
  \ too, was this simply wonderful moment only the three of us enjoyed together. Our\
  \ new friend\u2019s warmth and kindness in welcoming two Mzungus in his field was\
  \ a blessing, and a leap into the unknown I will never forget. I often dream of\
  \ this moment in time that altered my reality, and opened my eyes to the wonderful\
  \ opportunities hidden in distant and uncharted places."
