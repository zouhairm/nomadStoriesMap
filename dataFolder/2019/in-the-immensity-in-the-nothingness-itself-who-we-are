Text: 'San Francisco is a city that awakens.

  Its people, from all parts of the world, are creators who constantly exploit, live,
  meet and communicate; artists that express themselves in the streets, in the nature
  of large parks with different shades of green, that abstract us from the big city.

  The beach is warm like it is rarely the weather, but we also have the luck of beginner
  and the sun, shine. The mirrors in the sand are like another dimension, a journey
  into our interior, in a moment, in many moments ...

  It is a place of living souls. And others not so alive; with a history, with a hard
  past; that is not seen on television, or in the media that paint "The perfect American
  dream"

  It is a shocking parallel reality that sees a simple sight, that looks for much
  more than a dollar, a look of contempt or a gesture of surprise, and it is very
  easy in the eyes of the state, to look the other way.

  I tried to make portraits, but when it comes to a reality that does not even resemble
  ours, it''s complicated.

  San Francisco is expression, art, youth.

  And we are there, in the big city, immersed among great architectures, walking through
  streets that hurt, or landscapes that leave you breathless.

  Knowing their multicultural neighborhoods, the night that is dressed in small living
  lights .. And somewhere ... we are part of this world of seven million inhabitants,
  and we are so insignificants, so small, so immense ...'
