Text: "Road tripping is a theme that fits well with me. Having lived in three different\
  \ countries for long periods of time (Per\xFA, the USA and England), I am no stranger\
  \ to long journeys and the never-ending yearning for adventure that they bring.\
  \ I have an almost pathological need to be surrounded by people at all times - in\
  \ an excitable, friendly way, while simultaneously still trying to maintain my independence.\
  \ I am forever in flux, always trying to soak up as much as possible. Along the\
  \ way, I try to stay life-limber, curious and open-minded. And, due to my aforementioned\
  \ need to be with people, almost always whilst I\u2019m on the move I\u2019m bringing\
  \ family, a friend, someone along on the journey!\n\nGenerally, on road trips the\
  \ journey becomes bigger than the destination. The journey is the adventure, the\
  \ story, the experience. This is why I mostly take these journeys with my closest\
  \ friends and family. As I have gotten older, I\u2019ve come to realise that not\
  \ all my friends are up to the task of coming on an adventure with me. Some friends,\
  \ good friends in the static world, become unbearable travel companions on the road.\
  \ There\u2019s \u201Cthe complainer\u201D, \u201Cthe drama-queen\u201D, \u201Cthe\
  \ pessimist\u201D and \u201Cthe cheapskate\u201D. No matter how good a friend they\
  \ might be, I just know I do not want to travel with them. These people are simply\
  \ not the right characters for the stories I want to write or experience on my travels.\n\
  \nSadly, in the fast-paced age we now live in, road trips, with their slower pace\
  \ have become a thing of the past. Most people would rather hop on a plane and get\
  \ to their destination in a few hours, than waste days on end in a car. If nothing\
  \ else, it is much cheaper to fly. I once read an article about a college student\
  \ who took a trip around Europe and visited five different destinations by plane.\
  \ He chose to do this when he realised it would cost him less to fly around Europe\
  \ than it would to take a train from Birmingham to London. Personally, road tripping\
  \ is my favourite form of travel, and I believe people would do well to embrace\
  \ the beauty of going off the beaten track in order to discover the well-kept secrets\
  \ the world has to offer. For example; if you take a road-trip, chances are good\
  \ you\u2019ll pass through a town or place you have never heard of and will probably\
  \ never see again. It\u2019s not the same if you fly. It\u2019s the unknown, the\
  \ discovery of something new that makes the journey memorable. You will meet people\
  \ you would otherwise never have met and you will see things you would otherwise\
  \ never have seen. To quote John Steinbeck in Travels with Charley: \u201CWe find\
  \ after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us.\u201D \n\n\
  Some of my fondest memories growing up are of road trips taken with my family to\
  \ the seashores of Per\xFA, where I would watch the Pacific Ocean break upon the\
  \ sandy beaches that seemed to go on forever. Every summer my parents would take\
  \ us to the beach to go camping for a few weeks and we\u2019d escape the hustle\
  \ and bustle of Per\xFA\u2019s densely populated capital city, to be somewhere quieter\
  \ and calmer. My dad was always able to find the nicest, most secluded spots. He\u2019\
  d put extra effort into making sure we went on the most memorable road trips, perhaps\
  \ because he was so absent in our regular lives whilst running the busiest salsa\
  \ club in town.\n\nThose trips opened my mind up to the infinite possibilities for\
  \ adventure the world has to offer and set ablaze in me a passion for travel. Over\
  \ the course of my life, I have travelled across five different continents using\
  \ all means of transportation. I have flown, driven, cycled, walked, hiked, inter-railed\
  \ and hot air-ballooned but sadly, I have never been on a cruise. Me and the sea,\
  \ we don\u2019t get along so well.\n\nI once saw a quirky wall sign that read: \u201C\
  Travel is the only thing you can buy that makes you richer\u201D. No kidding."
