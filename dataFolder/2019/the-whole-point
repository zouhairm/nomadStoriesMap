Text: "This Buddha monument in the middle of the arrival hall reminds me of my first\
  \ thoughts in this country. It\u2019s been quite a journey. Airports are amazing.\
  \ Diversity here does not contradict authenticity of such a monument or the distinct\
  \ uniform of the workers. The well-made show of folk culture, mixed with its profound\
  \ presentation in people hugging, crying, and jumping in joy. Exactly one month\
  \ ago, I was afraid this journey would turn into a disaster, now and after all the\
  \ impasses that went through me, I know those days would always be counted of my\
  \ best. Speaking of impasses, I made a theory; problems make stories, and traveling\
  \ is very much about telling. \n\tI got robbed of half of my money only thirty six\
  \ hours after I left the airport the first time. I got into my room, checked on\
  \ my money for the next day trip, and I surely freaked out. Should I get into the\
  \ next plane before anything else happens, for this place is obviously unsafe? Instead\
  \ I went on only by inertia, I know I cannot back down now, and I cannot just announce\
  \ defeat. Your little money is cut into half, and now you need to sleep for next\
  \ day trip to beautiful Ella. I sleep, I get into a bus very close to burst into\
  \ tears; and I did. I cried in one of our rest stations. I left the people and went\
  \ to sit by a stunning lake; and I felt really small beside those huge trees, and\
  \ really alive beside that small stream. I was invaded by feelings; suddenly I am\
  \ more grateful than I ever may be, and braver than I ever have been. I teared because\
  \ I saw the money thing fading, and I wondered if I would ever be this happy again;\
  \ but surely I have been. You may know the elevator test; storytellers tell you\
  \ to imagine your character in an elevator that malfunctions. You observe how your\
  \ character would react to the situation and now you are friends. You revive him/her\
  \ using your words. That is exactly what happened to me, I was thrown out of my\
  \ system, and I discovered how brave, and adventurous I am. I started to discover\
  \ that the next day when I reached Adam\u2019s peak in Ella with my slippers on.\
  \ My sneakers were still in Colombo; because I was disturbed by the robbery and\
  \ left them beside the door. I remember that this mountain had two peaks, and the\
  \ way between them was not paved unlike the whole trail up. Some people decided\
  \ to be satisfied with one peak, but I felt missing the other one, and the way to\
  \ it. I did it with my feet in slippers, and my heart on my hand. Clouds from there\
  \ surely differed, and stupidity, also known as bravery, got me new friends. Friends\
  \ are beautiful things you make when you are abroad; people you travel with suddenly\
  \ and subtly become family members even if it was for that little time. Friends\
  \ were there with me when people broke into our residency house in Colombo, and\
  \ we were together laughing after I shouted my heart out when I saw someone sneaking\
  \ on us from the balcony.\n\tSri Lanka has been nothing but kind to me. Nature is\
  \ kind; and Sri Lanka is a huge forest that would offer a home to any creature.\
  \ So, for every time I was terrified by a robbery, or a big fight that I had to\
  \ get into, I was calmed down by an insect, an animal, a tree, or a tropical fruit.\
  \ You visit Trincomalee on the east coast, well-known for tribal fights, but you\
  \ find the ocean so welcoming, and safe. You need to have a very long, very not\
  \ comfortable trip, but all of a sudden an elephant troop crosses the road, and\
  \ everyone is watching and smiling.\nI learned there how to love spiders, and leeches.\
  \ So, maybe the whole point of traveling is to find things you like about life,\
  \ and to tell people that there is always more to life than they may imagine."
