Text: "Perspective to Choose\nI was expecting nothing and I knew nothing about the\
  \ place where I was going. Everything happened so fast; I would say faster than\
  \ the blink of my eye\u2026 and I blink often. So, the trip was unplanned, the people\
  \ I went with and place where I went were unfamiliar and there were just couple\
  \ of weeks to be acquainted with these intriguing issues. My quick research about\
  \ this region, culture and everything else gave me a vague idea of what I\u2019\
  m about to see. Despite controversial rumors of Xinjiang district and simple pictures\
  \ that I saw, the true Xinjiang district became enigmatic for me.  \nFirst, I would\
  \ like to start my story from our transportation as it may be one of the most important\
  \ parts in our big adventure. We\u2019ve reached China from Uzbekistan by bus and\
  \ it was quite a way: first reaching Almaty by bus (it took about 13 hours), then\
  \ reaching Urumchi, capital of Xinjiang district, again by bus (but that took about\
  \ 24 hours). Those hours on road opened up passing landscapes that were shifting\
  \ from vast deserted areas of Kazakhstan to huge mountainous ridges covered with\
  \ towering pine trees, and then leading to bridges as high as 9-storey buildings.\
  \  It\u2019s been a long way, and finally, after crossing Kazakh \u2013 Chinese\
  \ border and stepping on Chinese land, we were shocked as our bus left and we couldn\u2019\
  t find it anywhere. Unable to speak Chinese, I was stupefied. For the first time\
  \ in my life, I found myself in the country where people couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ me. However, it turned out that Uzbek and Uyghur languages belong to same group\
  \ of Turkic languages, although they have BIG differences. It was hard to communicate\
  \ and we barely understood each other, but at last we figured out that we need to\
  \ go to some bus station. As we were passing the streets of an unknown city, I thought\
  \ to myself, \u201CI\u2019m indeed in China\u201D. Architecture included many skyscrapers\
  \ which looked modern and simply structured, but mixed with traditional buildings;\
  \ however the whole scene was giving a tranquil feeling of steady flowing life in\
  \ that city. Decorations were prevailing with red color and on the roofs of most\
  \ buildings you could find flags of China, swaying smoothly up in the sky. Gradually\
  \ reaching the bus station with our backpacks on, we were thinking of finally getting\
  \ back to a place we know, to a place where people understand us and we understand\
  \ them, to our bus. Whereas it was a very different picture with unbelievable twist\
  \ as staff at bus station didn\u2019t intend to let us in. Speaking, gesturing,\
  \ but finally entering the bus station, we\u2019ve discovered that our bus is not\
  \ there. Hence, we ran around bus station, trying to find THE bus, it was exhausting,\
  \ dreadful and of no effect. Be that as it may, our last hope was gone and all that\
  \ was left for us to do is to buy some Chinese snack and relish it while sitting\
  \ on stairs and waiting for a miracle. As you can predict, buying an unknown snack\
  \ in an unknown place with unknown language can often have two outcomes: either\
  \ horrible or splendid. I\u2019ve experienced both outcomes; specifically I have\
  \ concluded that you can never call anything in China bland, regardless whether\
  \ it is food or snack or just a beverage. Chinese cuisine is absolutely replete\
  \ with various sour, spicy, sugary and other tangs demanding either love or hatred,\
  \ but very rarely impartiality. Admittedly, I fell in love with one food, but hardly\
  \ endured to cope with another. As a matter of fact, snack sampling was fun and\
  \ digressive event, particularly helpful during our anguished period of bus anticipation.\
  \ As we were finishing our snacks, we saw familiar bus driving into bus station\
  \ and a big sigh of relief filled everybody\u2019s hearts. \nThis was only the first\
  \ long part of our short trip. All in all, I\u2019d like to say, that leap into\
  \ the unknown is like going through a forest: you may be frightened all the time,\
  \ or you may take this time to behold the surrounding beauty; everything depends\
  \ on the perspective you choose."
