Text: "Yes...South Africa is my country of birth but learning and respecting new cultures\
  \ and what's out there is just so extensive.  The places I've been and what I've\
  \ experienced was extremely overwhelming even for me having been here my whole life.\n\
  \nTook a trip down to Cape Town and making a few pit stops on the way opened my\
  \ eyes to a number of experiences I thought we didn't even have.  One that stood\
  \ out for me was in the karoo at an ostrich farm.  Got to meet an experienced, down\
  \ to earth and down right friendly gentle by the name of sipho who took me through\
  \ the do's and don'ts of how to be around these incredible creatures...which might\
  \ I add please listen and remember, or you will increase your chances of either\
  \ being hurt or worse.  Needless to say I got onto the amazing creature, grabbed\
  \ on for dear life and had one endurance filled experience that I'd urge anyone\
  \ with an adrenaline rush to do.  The speed and strength of this big bird is one\
  \ not to be underestimated.\n\nFrom our great day at the farm we moved on to spend\
  \ a night at a 'haunted hotel' which would have been great under the influence of\
  \ a few sleeping tablets.  Was a fun experience either way.  This sleepless night\
  \ began with a freakishly large gentle greeting us and booking us all in explaining\
  \ the apparent haunting which we nervously laughed about.  Once showed to our rooms\
  \ and settling down the fun or should I say scaring began...pipes banging, floors\
  \ creeking and strange screaming which started faint and only got louder through\
  \ the course of the evening.  A huge bang on the door got me thinking whether or\
  \ not stay here was a good idea.  Longest night of my life but really well worth\
  \ it.  Checking out was my greatest experience of the whole haunted hotel experience.\n\
  \nFinally on the road again and on the way to what I've been excited for the whole\
  \ trip thus far.  A bungee jump at one of the highest bridges in the world.  We\
  \ arrive and already I'm feeling pins and needles running through my toes and fingertips.\
  \   The cold nervous feeling runs from my head to my toes as they take you through\
  \ the safety and security tips.  The dreaded time arrives as you get you harness\
  \ and legs strapped up and told to please be seated until called.  The sound of\
  \ people screaming as they jump gets my pulse throbbing and my heart wanting to\
  \ jump out of my chest.  The time arrives and the last thing I wanted to hear was\
  \ my name being called out!!!  \"Craig you up\".  Face face immediately lost colour,\
  \ my heart sank and the thought of backing out was right there again.  As I got\
  \ closer my heart beat raced quicker and quicker.  It's time... on the edge... breathing\
  \ like a dog on a hot day... do I dare look down... Are you ready the ask.  Nervously\
  \ replying \"let's do this\".  1...2...3... and I jump!  As I go down screaming\
  \ the last bit of air out of my lungs, I watch the rocks and river water come at\
  \ me faster and faster and then....BANG!!!! The bungee line yanks me straight back\
  \ up into the air.  Round two here we go as is plummet straight back down at the\
  \ water.  Finally it's over as I'm lowered onto the boat at the bottom.  Relieved\
  \ I ask the guy at the bottom if there is a bathroom nearby so I can check my underpants.\
  \  The experience was amazing and taught me that live life to the fullest and never\
  \ be afraid to try the unthinkable.  \n\nWe then ventured off to our destination\
  \ in sea point and had a number of excursions within Cape Town which included craft\
  \ beer, wine tours and shark diving.  Met really amazing people form different walks\
  \ of life and different cultures.  Made new friends and learnt alot about myself\
  \ and the lengths I'm willing to spread my will.  I don't want to end life wondering\
  \ what if and could I."
