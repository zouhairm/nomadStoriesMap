Text: "This is the closest I ever felt to God. To my right there is water. To my left\
  \ there is a solid wall. I can smell the seaweed in the damp air, I can hear the\
  \ seagulls flying over my head, and the bell rings coming from the distance. I am\
  \ in the most tourist-flooded city in the world, the pop star of trips, the fast\
  \ travel destination, the one stereotyped to the point where it no more can be seen\
  \ under the covers of diverse images and narratives. You got it right \u2013 I am\
  \ in Venice.\n\nThe grandeur of Venice you expect to feel once you get there is\
  \ in reality overshadowed by the number of people admiring it. So while making my\
  \ way through the afternoon city, I try to catch the glimpses of its little parts\
  \ small enough to still be lurking through the layers of foreigners. The wet steps\
  \ coming down to the channel, white stucco on the churches\u2019 facades, massive\
  \ bridges over the dark canals, calli and campi, markets filled with vegetables,\
  \ fruits, and fish. People on the terraces of the cafes sitting with their cigarettes\
  \ and coffee, gold bracelets and tan; boats floating on the water; gulls hovering\
  \ over them. It\u2019s been raining the whole morning, and now the first rays of\
  \ sun mirrored in the ripple on the channel\u2019s surface make gold on the old\
  \ ladies\u2019 wrists and the dome of the Basilica di San Marco spark brighter.\
  \ \n\nThe city is filled with people who are almost spilling over its thin borders\
  \ made of wooden balks and stone walls. Those are sinking slowly, at last surrendering\
  \ to the time they have spent fighting the sea, pretending to be just another fish\
  \ \u2013 a giant pesce in the Adriatic. Thousands of thousands of people are constantly\
  \ tapping over it \u2013 and I am just one of them. The city will never even remember\
  \ me. I am the sand on its scales. Joseph Brodsky \u2013 a celebrated poet who kept\
  \ coming back to Venice during his life \u2013 once wrote that happiness was a moment\
  \ of spotting the elements of your own composition being free. Here, in this city\
  \ which is inevitably becoming a part of the sea, people should feel the happiest\
  \ then. I instead feel overwhelmed.  \n\nAt last, I step on the Fondamenta degli\
  \ Incurabili, the Embankment of the Incurable which these days is called Zattere\
  \ \u2013 the longest embankment in Venice, and the farthest to its South. Brodsky\
  \ named one of the most prominent works of his after this place. Water to the right,\
  \ stone to the left. There is no one here, except me. It feels surreal to be alone\
  \ after the endless crowds flooding the city which struggles so hard to escape the\
  \ flood. The border with history is thin here \u2013 no one is making it stronger\
  \ by their presence, so I can see it still as the place for incurable from hundreds\
  \ of years ago, enlivened with the people who were destined not to live long. Water\
  \ makes it look clearer. \n\nI am exposed. The place I am in is almost naked as\
  \ well: the city and its eternal spirit can\u2019t be hiding behind peoples\u2019\
  \ backs anymore. Suddenly it is very quiet, it is just the city and me, and the\
  \ time is passing between us, carrying the words of the poet because of whom I came\
  \ here, at this abandoned place surrounded by multilingual crowds. \u2018God is\
  \ time, or at least [\u2026] His spirit is. [\u2026] if the Spirit of God moved\
  \ upon the face of the water, the water was bound to reflect it.\u2019 The water\
  \ is everywhere, reflecting everything but itself. \n\nI came to Venice to find\
  \ a clich\xE9d place, a romantic city of gondolas and canals. Instead, I found something\
  \ much bigger than that \u2013 hidden in the water, hidden inside me, pretending\
  \ to be a fish. Just another pesce in the Adriatic."
