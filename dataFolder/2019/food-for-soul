Text: "When I got off from the train I could immediately feel the sensuous, thick\
  \ spirit of Storyville which was situated only a few blocks away from the station.\
  \ I imagined the XIX century prostitutes, often naked, waving to the train passengers\
  \ from their balconies. And adventure searching customers with the famous Storyville\
  \ blue books - guides for the visitors to the district's prostitution services;\
  \ they included house descriptions, prices, particular services, and the \"stock\"\
  \ that each house offered. Nowadays people can see young half-naked girls, mostly\
  \ tourists, only at carnival time. Walking down Basin Street I couldn't get off\
  \ my head Louis Prima's voice: Basin Street is the street, where the best folks\
  \ always meet, in New Orleans, land of dreams, ou'll never know how nice it seems,\
  \ or just how much it really means...Then my internal turntable wobbled and the\
  \ beat changed into the most sampled song in history: \"Take me to the Mardi Gras\"\
  . Right behind the corner, a handsome black man was using hoodoo-type tricks to\
  \ impress Beyonce-look-like girl. He definitely involved all his charms and voodoo\
  \ spells. \"Whoo doo you love?\"  - Bo Diddley played on my inner disc. Music is\
  \ everywhere in New Orleans, indeed. New Orleans IS music.\nSeeing gris-gris - voodoo\
  \ good luck charm -  on somebody's neck, I recalled Baron Samedi who had come here\
  \ from Haiti. This particular Baron wears top hats, black tuxedos, eye-catching\
  \ purple shirts and sunglasses that are missing one lens. Drinking a fiery mixture\
  \ of rum with chile peppers, he smokes unfiltered cigarettes. The lord of procreation\
  \ and destruction, lust and misadventure. The most interesting, funny, and outrageous\
  \ spirit in the Voodoo tradition. He is vulgar and is known to curse and play fights.\
  \ He also likes talking continuously about sex, embarrassing people by letting their\
  \ secrets be known. Baron is known to be a thief at times, and usually steals little\
  \ things here and there. On the other hand, he often saves people from death. Only\
  \ Baron Samedi has the power to accept an individual into the world of the dead.\
  \ Being the patron of those who died prematurely by unnatural causes, he is quite\
  \ popular here. People come to Bywater to ask him to drive away crack cocaine abuse,\
  \ burglaries, prostitution and assaults which are too common in this rotten with\
  \ corruption place.\nPassing through Congo Square\u2014originally known as \"Place\
  \ des N\xE8gres\"\u2014where slaves gathered on Sundays to dance, I ran across a\
  \ funeral. The music accompanying the funeral became more upbeat. I placed myself\
  \ in the second line following the band just to enjoy the music. Other second-liners\
  \ carried white handkerchiefs which they waved to symbolize the flight of the spirit.\
  \ There were also some open umbrellas reminding that we all walk in the shadow of\
  \ death. The rhythm of tambourines and drums was pulling me toward the cemetery.\
  \ Enchanted by soulful voices, I found myself alone among XVIIIcentury tombstones\
  \ and sculptures. The place looked creepy yet attractive. I decided to have a look\
  \ at the famous Saint Louis Cemetery but the southern heat and weariness were so\
  \ unbearable that I ended up resting next to Marie Laveau's gravestone.\nAnd then\
  \ that awkward moment came when I was in deep thought, and I realized I had been\
  \ staring directly at someone. The awkwardness was emphasized by his inappropriate\
  \ loud laugh. The guy who was oddly dressed in an expensive but outworn suit sent\
  \ me the most charming smile and the most coarse comment about my breast. I was\
  \ pretty sure that bum would rape me with his umbrella but surprisingly he sat next\
  \ to me and offered a stinky cigar. He opened his half broken parasol giving us\
  \ a nice shadow. He put his sunglasses on. One of the lenses was broken but he didn't\
  \ care even when it fell. His foul-mouthed monologue was hypnotizing. There was\
  \ something alluring about that weirdo and I hoped it wasn't that fine and strong\
  \ alcohol he treated me with. Anxiety that accompanied me at the beginning of our\
  \ meeting disappeared. He finished his wicked but wise speech with a sinister laugh\
  \ and another sexist joke. \u201EI love your magenta dress\" - he said at the end."
