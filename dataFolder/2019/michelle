Text: "In the 90s, I remember an international sponsorship commercial broadcasting\
  \ between Saturday morning cartoons. Indulging in a large bowl of cereal, I watched\
  \ a well-dressed bearded man representing the Christian Children\u2019s Fund slowly\
  \ walk through the landfill of a third world country. He carried a native child\
  \ named Michelle. While walking through the dumpsite, he explained that television\
  \ viewers can sponsor a child for 80 cents per day. Mesmerized by the piercing stare\
  \ and hopeful smile of Michelle as she wore her begrimed red dress with once white\
  \ ruffles and polka dots, this commercial ignited a fire inside of me that lingered\
  \ into my adult years. Each time the commercial aired, feelings of guilt and privilege\
  \ ruined my appetite. As a child, I believed that flying to less fortunate countries\
  \ to offer help held more value than money. I promised myself that if I was unable\
  \ to save Michelle, I would save children like her.\n\nFaced with my promise on\
  \ November 16, 2007, along with my college peers, I found myself standing in a malodorous\
  \ dumpsite in San Pablo, Laguna in the Philippines with children that resembled\
  \ Michelle. In addition to being engulfed in debris, we saw homes assembled from\
  \ rusted sheet metal, stained sheets, cardboard, and plastic. A few feet away from\
  \ the homes was a school that local children attended. We learned that the teachers\
  \ volunteered and taught between their primary jobs in attempts to give the youth\
  \ a chance at life.\n\nFrontline Ministries, a faith-based, non-profit organization\
  \ that has served the San Pablo community for decades, brought us to the wasteland.\
  \ Face the Children, a subsidiary of their main organization, rescues abandoned\
  \ and abused children from the streets and landfills offering rehabilitation and\
  \ healthier life. Our mission was to guest teach and bring the children food in\
  \ hopes that their parents would allow the organization to save them. Many of the\
  \ children provided for themselves by collecting plastic for currency and using\
  \ the disposal area as shelter due to their parent\u2019s incarceration or death.\n\
  \nAbsent of a school bell, the teachers yelled in Tagalog across the dumping grounds\
  \ that school would soon begin. A sea of sun-kissed children dressed in rags, ran\
  \ from their dumpsite dwellings to gather outside the structure hoping for a seat\
  \ inside.\n\nForming a line into the school entryway, the kids took their seats\
  \ as the teachers gathered my peers and me before the makeshift classroom. The students\
  \ whispered to one another and grinned as the teachers introduced us in their native\
  \ tongue. Although the children would not understand, my classmates and I were asked\
  \ to speak about ourselves to give the students an opportunity to hear the American\
  \ language. While speaking, a volunteer translated our introductions. The children\
  \ were attentive, smiled in awe, and clapped after we finished.\n\nHours went by\
  \ as we assisted with classroom duties and food distribution. To close the day,\
  \ instructors requested that we find a seat in the classroom and sit among the children.\
  \ I found a seat next to a girl reminiscent of Michelle from the commercial. Her\
  \ warm-hearted smile and compelling gaze exceeded her circumstances, and the stained\
  \ clothing she wore. I reciprocated the smile, greeted her, and proceeded to color\
  \ with her. She innocently reached out to touch my hair and face as she smirked\
  \ and uttered a question in Tagalog. With an expression of embarrassment, one of\
  \ the teachers came over to gently tell her not to touch me. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s okay,\u201D I smiled. The little girl asked her question again; this time I asked\
  \ the teacher what she was saying.\n\n\u201CShe\u2019s asking if you\u2019re her\
  \ sister.\u201D The teacher smiled and looked at the girl endearingly and reassured\
  \ her that I was not her sister. My dark skin and hair convinced her otherwise.\n\
  \nWith a saddened look in her eyes, the girl stood up and placed her head on my\
  \ shoulder and hugged my side. She did not see me as African-American; she saw me\
  \ as Filipina. With my eyes closed, I returned the affection.\n\nShe smiled and\
  \ sat down. We spent the rest of our time together communicating through the colors\
  \ of broken crayons underneath the rusted metal roof of the classroom."
