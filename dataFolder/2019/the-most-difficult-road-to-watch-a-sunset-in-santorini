Text: "All my trips are pictured with perfect scenarios; the target place can be reached\
  \ in different ways. When traveling you expect to have the time of your life, however,\
  \ money, people and of course time are factors that affect the way we get to our\
  \ destiny, this was not the exception. \n\nAll began when Cesar, Esther and I were\
  \ just outside of the Gran Via Subway station in Madrid, with our cameras were ready\
  \ to take the best pictures of one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Europe, not\
  \ only the architecture but also culture were the attractions in this trip, our\
  \ first night began with a dinner at Puerta del Sol square surrounded by tapas and\
  \ a Flamenco spectacle, but no one imagined  that night would be the most difficult\
  \ beginning to our main aim, Santorini.\n   \nAfter a few days our flight to Rome\
  \ was close, however Esther had to return unexpectedly to Panama due to a big problem\
  \ in her job, it was the worst birthday gift ever for her, then Cesar and I flew\
  \ to Italy, Naples was our second stop, as we landed I tried to get some cash and\
  \ my credit card was blocked for no reason, things were getting problematic, so\
  \ I had to get rid of expenses.  We checked in our hotel near Plaza Garibaldi, once\
  \ we opened the door, our room had a terrible look, an annoying noise in the bathroom,\
  \ the bed seemed to have bugs and a dirty and dusty wallpaper. We decided to go\
  \ outside and have a cappuccino, that city was empty, not even a cat walking or\
  \ a bird flying, it was perhaps the quietest night ever.\nThis road to our main\
  \ destination had a lot of peaks and valleys till now, before taking off to Bucharest\
  \ the tours in Rome, The Vatican and Venice were the longest and amazing walks \
  \ in my life, sightseeing had never been so marvelous, still with a tight budget\
  \ and more than 5 cities left to discover. Our second day in Rumania was the climax\
  \ of all of our concerns, but how did we end up in the police station? Well, one\
  \ day before we looked for a club where we could have fun and meet some travelers,\
  \ we party till the sun came up, as I woke up some flashbacks came to my mind, I\
  \ looked at my crashed phone with a message from the airline to get my check in\
  \ ready to Istanbul, I asked Cesar for his passport number but as the minutes passed\
  \ by he was getting worried, it wasn\xB4t anywhere, we immediately went out to look\
  \ for it in all the places we were before, the club, the theater but no sing if\
  \ it, we took a taxi with a local driver who did not speak an English word at all,\
  \ he took us to the police station, we stood in front of an officer who barely understood\
  \ a word, Cesar had to wait for Monday as the Mexican embassy could help him, with\
  \ 12 hours left to travel to Turkey I had to say bye to another friend till he could\
  \ get his documents back.\n\nOnce in Istanbul the atmosphere and people were complete\
  \ strangers to me even language was a barrier my speaking was slow and clumsy it\
  \ was a different world, It took me about 4 hours to get to my place, I didn\xB4\
  t expect to find myself all alone far away from home with no friends or companion,\
  \ finally outside of my balcony I could admire one of the oldest structures of what\
  \ was called Constantinople. \nThe sun came up, I grabbed my camera and walked through\
  \ the city for a while, it was noon and I met Cesar outside the Species bazaar with\
  \ a relieved face and his passport back.\n\nWe had reached the peak, ready to go\
  \ to Santorini, all those issues stated here gave me the toughest travel adventures\
  \ ever. The Day had come on the Aegean sea in the north coast of Thira, with a glass\
  \ of wine my eyes captured what my camera didn\xB4t, the last rays of the sun which\
  \ flawlessly touched the ocean."
