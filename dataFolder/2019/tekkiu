Text: "Hello mum,\nthe plane takes off and I see this land made of humble people,\
  \ colors and emotions stepping away. \nWhen I got to Marocco, a red flag with a\
  \ green star waved, like welcoming me. \nGot a taxi, the way was to Marrakech. The\
  \ road run along red soil hills, the same us ours in Puglia, but with more sparse\
  \ vegetation, made of little ever-green trees not higher than two meters. Got to\
  \ the city, I was stupefied by the suburbs. As far as the eye could see, leaning\
  \ houses left space to orange buildings, as highlighting the social hierarchy which\
  \ distinguishes them. A bright sky remembered that, in the end, we were all equal,\
  \ regardless the kind house in which we lived. \nArrived to the main square \u201C\
  Jemnaa el Fna\u201D , surrounded by the old town, I looked around amazed.I made\
  \ my way between snake charmers and tattooist I headed towards the middle of the\
  \ square where I found an infinite diversity of street-food stalls, rounded by every\
  \ size and kind buildings. The orange shined in his whole beauty.  I wolked on my\
  \ way looking for my accommodation. The narrow streets were made of bumpy tiles,\
  \ that sometimes were missing.  An explosion of colors and life seemed no ending\
  \ in that maze of streets. Shops of bright colored clothes, metal teapots or cosmetic\
  \ products were side by side along the street. A mazy ceiling made with cane mats\
  \ was shielding from the burning sun. \nThrough a wood doorway, I got into the accommodation\
  \ and due to a heavy violet drape I discovered the heart's house: columns of white\
  \ sparkling marble made arches decorated with curtains of the same color which surrounded\
  \ the internal swimming pool in the middle of the house. A stone staircase led to\
  \ the second floor, where the same structure of bows was made.\nThe alarm rang soon\
  \ the following morning and I went to the meeting point of a road trip towards Sahara.\
  \ Thanks to the altitude of the road on which we were, I could look down to other\
  \ streets that seemed like charmed snakes by a great piper.\nDuring one of the organized\
  \ stops, we were on the side of a valley full of vegetation. The rural town stretched\
  \ down towards a dry river, which divided it into two sections. On the other side\
  \ the village grew on a hill. Getting there, some children got closer, asking for\
  \ change... Fifty pence could feed a family for about three days! In my pockets,\
  \ I found a five pounds note and I tendered it to the closest child: he was skinny,\
  \ with black hair and big brown eyes which seemed to dream the wonders of our world.\
  \ Getting the note his eyes widened with astonishment and with a big smile told\
  \ me, almost screaming: \"Tekkiu!\". \nWith my eyes I followed him running away.\
  \ Heading towards the top, I noticed how the houses were entirely made of earthenware,\
  \ some of them were empty, some collapsed. While we were climbing up, I saw the\
  \ same child pulling the robe of a lady while pointing me with his finger. She was\
  \ his mum, who was wearing a long night blue dress and through the burqua I could\
  \ see the same big brown eyes of her son. But hers had a different depth, touched\
  \ from seeing her son so happy and full of hope to want to give him, at least, a\
  \ better future. She got closer to me and, with respectful distance slightly bowed,\
  \ told me with a warm calm voice: \"Thank you\". \"You're welcome\" I answered breathlessly\
  \ looking into her eyes.\nIt was at that moment that I decided to write you this\
  \ letter, mum. I wanted to tell you that I never would have imagined to feel, here\
  \ in Marocco, such as great deep love that only a mother can communicate through\
  \ eyes and two simple words... \nThrough the plane window I can recognize London,\
  \ already.From country houses to the skyscrapers in the center, it looks immense.\
  \ I see all the richness in which we live and think about that child, who with five\
  \ pounds, was the happiest in this world."
