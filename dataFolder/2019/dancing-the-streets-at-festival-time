Text: "Every country has celebrations for special days. I was invited to dance as\
  \ a clown from the city\xB4s bus stop to the soccer stadium in La Paz. The whole\
  \ street for 8 kilometers was lines with people. They throw flour, water balloons,\
  \ and soak the clowns the whole way. The objective is to dance the complete distance.\
  \ Trying to dance 8 kilometers is a bit of a long stretch. Especially when the group\
  \ behind the group you are with starts singing and drinking. Any group just getting\
  \ close to them is welcomed to drink, anyone coming near to drink a bit too. \n\n\
  What is thrilling is the community's excitement for those dancing and singing along\
  \ the way! Their songs make you realize that they enjoy community. While dancing\
  \ groups at times pull complete strangers from the crowd and skip to a tune that\
  \ just starts performing from one of the many bands that plays. \n\nAfter about\
  \ two kilometers of dancing in a line, or moving very little you are soaked beyond\
  \ going jumping into a swimming hole with all your clothes on. Bring a backpack\
  \ or something waterproof to store a towel. Normally only locals join the party.\
  \ However, if you purchase a mask and custom and are willing be soaked you too can\
  \ dance with the clowns of La Paz, Bolivia.  \n\nOnce you get to the soccer stadium,\
  \ there is public transportation to take you to where ever you need to go. A van\
  \ costing 2.6 Bolivians or less than 60 cents a van will drop you off throughout\
  \ the city. The whole occurrence can usually be experienced in April right before\
  \ Easter.  \n\nIf you are not into public transportation for less than three dollars,\
  \ you can catch a taxi from there to several different restaurants and cafe, which\
  \ will serve a variety of foods to your liking. The suggestion prior to Easter is\
  \ the pork. The different ways of frying it and adding sauce make each restaurant\
  \ their own little speciality shop. \n\nIt is a city celebrating and having good\
  \ clean fun."
