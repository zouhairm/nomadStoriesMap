Text: "My name is Aygun. I am from Azerbaijan. If someone asks me, \"what is your\
  \ prime wish\",  immediately I'll say \"travel\" . There are many reasons. I'll\
  \ say two main of them. \nFirstly, I want to illustrate my travel imagines. When\
  \ I was two years old me and my family members were banish from our hometown Qarabag,\
  \ in 1992 and over 20 years we live in Baku as a refugees. Since I have known myself\
  \ I want to find a way that can takes me to my birth land. That is why, I believe\
  \ if I travel more one of my journay  way  takes me to my Qarabag. The second reason\
  \ is close with my curiosity. So, I like to meet new cultures of different folks,\
  \ to be in historical places and etc. Shortly, I want to improve myself and the\
  \ best way for it is travel. Portugal one of my favorite country and it famous for\
  \ its cluture, for its geographic places and for its history. For instance, the\
  \ city of Lisbon is rich in architecture; Romanesque, Gothic, Manueline, Baroque,\
  \ Modern and Postmodern constructions can be found all over Lisbon. Also country\
  \ is famous with amazing museums such as National Museum of Ancient Art, Calouste\
  \ Gulbenkian Museum containing varied collections of ancient and modern art and\
  \ others. It is my wish to be there and the way to Lisbon is going through that\
  \ scholarship. I believe I will winner!"
