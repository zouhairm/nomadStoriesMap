Text: "Beginning from my courious mind about Thailand,I start to do my solo backpacker\
  \ to the Southeast asian neighbour.wondering their cultures,freedom,famous street\
  \ food,unique habit and looking for pleasure that I've never found in my hometown.\
  \ I spent 4 night at Bangkok. Saturday I already arrived to dong mueang airport\
  \ get local sim card and the customer service will help to register our card then\
  \ took a bus to get to my hotel place. And here the real journey began,all the bus\
  \ sign board is written using Thai character,how am I supposed to understand? Luckly\
  \ there were some guard will assist us to get the right bus to our destination.\n\
  My first day is just moving around the famous khaosand road till night,and then\
  \ my second day I'm traveling around chaopraya river,my jackpot our face having\
  \ similar with local folk they took my rate as local too not as tourist how fun,then\
  \ the next day when I'm around I do really lost in the midle of nowhere cause I\
  \ took the wrong bus and because of language barrier  I'm unable to ask anybody.thanks\
  \ God the driver using his Google translate give me direction how to get my destination.\
  \ \nSo far when I've been there all the local peoples very helpful and I'm very\
  \ impressed. So be nice to all because it will return to us. If there were no good\
  \ people let's be the ones."
