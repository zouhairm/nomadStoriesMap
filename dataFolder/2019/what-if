Text: "What if...\n\nTime and time again, I think about some song that says, \"Life\
  \ takes care of dates.\" And when I think about it, I actually think about the many\
  \ encounters, and mismatches that bring about encounters.\n\nIt's funny to think\
  \ of how each choice influences the people we know and the relationships we build.\
  \ In those moments just out of curiosity I start to ask myself: \"What if ...?\"\
  \n\nIf I had not crossed the street? if I had not taken that bus? If I had not gone\
  \ to live in that neighborhood, in that street? (my parents did not even want to\
  \ live there)... I would not have studied at that school... I would not approach\
  \ those people.\n\nSchool... I should have skipped the series... I did not have\
  \ to change so many times in school... I spent so little time in some... others\
  \ I did not even like... it did not go through my head to go to that other one...\
  \ When I saw I was already there... and I was glad I was.\n\nAnd that course? I\
  \ had never imagined doing it, I was certain of what I wanted to do with my life...\
  \ I ended up choosing by luck in the bench of a mall ... yeah, there's no way, it\
  \ was supposed to be... Tourism.\n\nSometimes I really think the Tourism chosen\
  \ me. Every shoot that I\u2019ve tried that year lead me to this. And then, my first\
  \ trip, at 17 years old. First college trip, first time away my parents, my sister.\
  \ I could not imagine that this would be the first of many times in that destiny\
  \ that one day would become \u201Cmy place\u201D.\n\nI just was looking for a direction\
  \ in my life. Something that gave me some stability. I could not realize how many\
  \ places I would know. I\u2019ve never guess how much I would learn about so many\
  \ things and, especially, about myself and my roots traveling away and even inside\
  \ my own city.\n\nWhat about that another trip? Everything planned for that other\
  \ destination, reservations made ... Everything went wrong ... did it really? In\
  \ another, I do not even know how I got there, when I saw I was already on a bus\
  \ going to I do not know where ... in the middle of a lot of people unknown ...\
  \ A weekend and suddenly unconditionality becomes present.\n\nMany people think\
  \ that traveling is about fun, status, something about money and privilege. I really\
  \ cannot omit the fact that traveling is not accessible to everyone, especially\
  \ considering where I came from. But what I think about the travel experience today\
  \ is that it is really about finding beauty in different corners and details, about\
  \ a new way of seeing the world and changing our way of being and thinking, even\
  \ if our look and feel, always have a little of our own personality and the luggage\
  \ that we accumulate throughout our lives.\n\nWhat I can say is that traveling anywhere\
  \ takes us out of our bubble. It takes us outside our home and our social circle.\
  \ It teaches and trains people to absorb adversity and give light to the impact\
  \ they cause.\n\nTravels are life experiences. Traveling is necessary. All the experiences\
  \ and learnings of a trip are part of who you are. It's all yours, forever. So it\
  \ is permanent and right. To travel is to invest in your most precious possession.\
  \ It is investing in you. Because travel changes people. They change the worlds.\
  \ The horizons.\n\nWell, but back to the question I put myself: What if? What I\
  \ can say is that I made plans ... I chose without thinking ... I gave up ... I\
  \ changed my mind (and how good it is to change my mind) ... I embraced the unknown.\n\
  \nSo many choices, so many omissions (which are also no longer choices), took me\
  \ and brought me sometimes what I was looking for or what I needed, as this serendipity\
  \ says there. It turns out that when you get lost and wonder if you made the right\
  \ choices, it's who we found (or was found) that helps us remember our place."
