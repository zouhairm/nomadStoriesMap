Text: "I like to balance my travel between two types of trips.  The first time I visit\
  \ a place I do everything that can be done- visit every major site, check out the\
  \ art and cultural museums, and try to find that perfect photo for my social media.\
  \  In a mad dash I explore and get to know the superficial feeling of a place and\
  \ its people. \n\nThe second experience, is the return trip, getting beyond the\
  \ superficial. Going back to places that you can\u2019t get out of your mind and\
  \ delving deeper, making friends, exploring the culture.  There are places that\
  \ I return again and again \u2013 like Bruges. \n\nBruges is a fairytale town \u2013\
  \ a UNESCO world heritage site.  An old canal port town, the Spanish sailors thought\
  \ the name sound like \u2018bruja\u2019 or witch and told tales of full of magic,\
  \ now the canals are all but gone, but the magic remains. \n\nA friend and I were\
  \ visiting  in The Hague for a conference when we decided to take the train a to\
  \ Bruges for the weekend.  We Booked a hotel online last minute, booked tickets,\
  \ and were on our way. The train pull into the city center and it turns out we had\
  \ somehow managed to book a hotel while a sold out music festival was taking place.\
  \  The outskirts of the historic city center were crowded music fans dancing , drinking,\
  \ and celebrating a mild summer day.  As we passed, I was excited that we had already\
  \  booked our hotel. \n\nWalking down the cobblestone streets the city opened up\
  \ like a book, its beautiful historic rowhouse neighborhoods, churches, and art.\
  \  Enjoying  the seemingly kismet way everything was working so smoothly my friend\
  \ and I stopped for a drink before proceeding  on to our hotel, to check in and\
  \ drop our bags.  But our luck wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 our hotel reservations\
  \ were for another weekend- and briefly, we thought our magic weekend might be over\
  \ before it began.\n\nTrying to keep our spirits up, we left  our bags with the\
  \ front desk of the small hotel and we headed towards the market and the famous\
  \ belfry. My fourth visit, and the small city never ceases to amaze me.  Having\
  \ been one of the  most prosperous  cities in Europe in the 15th century  when it\
  \ was a major port, but markets changed and it went into decline, the canals filled\
  \ in, the city froze, no longer aging, developing, changing. There are very few\
  \ places like it in the world, and there we were trapped with no where to go. \n\
  \nI took my friend to one of my favorite bars on the edge of town and we started\
  \ drinking, talking with locals, tourist, and festival goers alike. We asked for\
  \ ideas, called hotels, and laughed at the situation. Travel is all about the unexpected,\
  \ right? \n\nWe decided to Uber back to hotel to get our bags and maybe take the\
  \ train home early,- and then the magic turned back on.  Our Uber driver, the charming\
  \ Jan, ever part of the modern gig society, lived in town but was also house sitting\
  \ for his parents. They were gone for the next two months and he had been setting\
  \ their home up with plans to register it as an AirBnb (but hadn\u2019t finished\
  \ in time for the festival). Jan took us to get our bags, then took us outside the\
  \ historic city  center walls to his parents\u2019 home in the modern Bruges.  He\
  \ opened the side gate, walked us in to his backyard, and to their home \u2013 where\
  \ the back door was open to the garden. Greeted at the open door by their friendly\
  \ golden retrievers, Jan showed us to our rooms.   Only knowing us for 5 minutes,\
  \ Jan provided us a place to stay for the two nights for almost nothing- and sat\
  \ with us sharing a bottle of wine telling us stories in his kitchen.\n\nThis was\
  \ my fourth trip to Bruges \u2013 but I had never explored the city outside the\
  \ walls. A city that looks like many other European cities, but where people leave\
  \ doors open, and invite in stranded strangers. It was a kindness I didn\u2019t\
  \ expect to find."
