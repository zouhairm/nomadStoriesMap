Text: "It was June 23rd, we were right in the middle of the highest tourism season\
  \ of Peru and Bolivia. I was working as a tour leader at the time, taking groups\
  \ on amazing trips across breathtaking South American landscapes. Everything seemed\
  \ to be under control, even the uncontrollable factors like weather, until the unexpected\
  \ happened: a strike. \nStrikes are quite common in South America, and although\
  \ us tour leaders know we are always at risk of encountering one of these \u2018\
  exciting\u2019 events, we never get used to them. It is so hard to deal with the\
  \ logistics and to keep our groups happy, safe and motivated through hard times\
  \ like this! \nThis strike though, was special. We were in Puno, the region where\
  \ Lake Titikaka, the highest navigable lake in the world, is located. We were supposed\
  \ to go on a tour to the lake, but the strikers were not going to let us fulfill\
  \ our trip plan. Gladly, there was an equally awesome tour in the Bolivian side\
  \ of the lake with no potential strikers to ruin our trip.\nWe travelled for a few\
  \ hours, we took a train, then a bus and finally hiked for about an hour until we\
  \ arrived at a beautiful stone house on top of the Sun Island. It was a very cold\
  \ night, a typical winter night in the Andes, at 3800 m.a.s.l (14000 ft.). We had\
  \ a soup and went straight to be, so tired for the hustle that brought us there.\
  \ Only a few hours later, when it was still dark, the father of the family woke\
  \ us up, he just said: \u201Cit is time to go, new year is coming\u201D\nDid I hear\
  \ that right? It is June, we are not even close to new year! Well not for the Aymara\
  \ people, for whom the year starts on June 24th and they celebrate with a series\
  \ of rituals that I can still recall in detail. It all started with the community\
  \ members gathering at the top of the island before the sun came out. The local\
  \ shaman led rituals to clean the souls of the believers and guided them through\
  \ their soul-renewing journey. Then everybody, kids and old elderly, stood in direction\
  \ to the sunrise with their arms open, wishing to be blessed by the first rays of\
  \ their god, the sun.\nWhen the sun was out and shinning right over our heads, all\
  \ locals started giving each other such heartfelt and warm hugs. That is when the\
  \ party started, with people dancing in their most colorful traditional clothes,\
  \ holding hands, laughing with so much joy it was contagious. Happy new year brother!\
  \ Happy new year sister! We did not fully understand what we were witnessing but\
  \ we knew we were lucky to be there, by \u2018mistake\u2019, as a consequence of\
  \ an unfortunate event that turned out to be the best (bad) luck incident we could\
  \ have ever had. \nAfter this event, I became more optimist when I faced strikes\
  \ because I thought of them as opportunities for living exciting unusual experiences.\
  \ I do not think the tourists in my group minded the hustle we went through to get\
  \ to the other side of the lake either. After all, nobody gets to celebrate new\
  \ year twice the same year and few will ever get the chance to take part in such\
  \ a magical mystery tour."
