Text: "Sweat was dripping down my calves, a surefire sign I was overheating from the\
  \ 90-degree Australian summer heat. I dashed up three flights of stairs to my hostel\
  \ dorm room in Bondi Beach, taking care to avoid the reception area and, more specifically,\
  \ the receptionist. After dabbing off the sweat and changing into a relaxed, floral\
  \ print romper, I sauntered downstairs to the bright and nautical reception area\
  \ by 2:50 pm. With navy, cushioned benches lining three walls and seat-to-ceiling\
  \ windows overlooking the beach, this room was the hostel\u2019s primary social\
  \ spot.\n\nTrying to act as if it were simply a coincidence that I arrived minutes\
  \ before the receptionist finished his shift, I sat with other long-term guests\
  \ playing blackjack in the corner. At precisely three o\u2019clock, Kyle tossed\
  \ his black backpack over his shoulder and wandered over to the group from his desk.\
  \ I hesitated before looking up, but could tell he was hovering nearby, shifting\
  \ back and forth, with his hands in the pockets of his black jeans. \u201COdd,\u201D\
  \ I thought, \u201Che never sticks around after his shift.\u201D\n\nA few days prior,\
  \ and with only ten days before I permanently left Sydney, I finally worked up the\
  \ courage to add Kyle on Facebook. For three weeks, I had been regularly eavesdropping\
  \ on his Australian banter and eyeing the charming smirk he held on his face while\
  \ he worked. I was eager to discover if this could be something more. \n\nHis eyes,\
  \ as blue as the Pacific Ocean, pierced mine and I felt a pull in my chest as he\
  \ asked, \u201CWhat are you doing right now?\u201D A simple question, but the tone\
  \ in his voice exuded concern that I may have plans.\n\n\u201CNothing,\u201D I replied,\
  \ curiosity lingering on the tip of my tongue. \n\nHe moved closer, standing over\
  \ me as he boldly stated, \u201CWalk me to my car.\u201D\n\nI was taken aback by\
  \ the confidence in his voice and could only muster the word, \u201CWhat?\u201D\n\
  \nHe repeated himself. Still puzzled, I pointed to my bare feet and refused to climb\
  \ up three flights of stairs to my room for shoes just to walk him to his car. \n\
  \nWith a smoothness I\u2019ve only seen in romantic comedies, he said I was out\
  \ of excuses because he would walk barefoot, too. My mind flashed back to my travel\
  \ goals and I realized this was the perfect opportunity to trust my gut and say\
  \ \u201Cyes\u201D more often, so I shrugged away my resistance and off we went.\
  \ \n\nOutside the hostel, Kyle guided us to a round bench covered in red and blue\
  \ mosaic tiles to remove his black Converse. As we hiked up the road to his car,\
  \ the soles of our feet sweltering from the black pavement, he shot off question\
  \ after question as if I were in a job interview and he was short on time. From\
  \ university experiences, travel plans, and even my unhealthy relationship with\
  \ my father, he didn\u2019t stifle his curiosity. We disliked each other\u2019s\
  \ musical interests, but I admired his knowledge of foreign politics and he was\
  \ fascinated by my personal travel blog. I never expected to find a local connection\
  \ in a hostel full of international travelers, yet here I was.\n\nLittle did I know\
  \ when agreeing to walk Kyle to his car that the next seven evenings would involve\
  \ midnight coffees in unfamiliar streets, late night swims with sea urchins, and\
  \ watching a fiery sunset from a rickety dock at a beach we called \u201Cours.\u201D\
  \ Driven to unique places I wouldn\u2019t have discovered without my own local guide,\
  \ my final week in Sydney was every backpacker\u2019s dream.\n\nAfter we walked\
  \ twenty minutes to his car, he drove me back to the hostel. I casually mentioned\
  \ how I\u2019d only driven once in Australia because it was the wrong side of the\
  \ road for me. \n\nRadiating excitement as I took the stairs two at a time, I burst\
  \ inside the hostel. With my exhilaration from the success of saying \u201Cyes\u201D\
  \ evident in my gap-toothed grin, I took him up on his departing offer to teach\
  \ me how to drive on the left side of the road and messaged,\n\n\u201CSo, when are\
  \ we going driving?\u201D"
