Text: "It happened in the Summer of 2018, when me and my three friends visited the\
  \ historic town of Seville in Spain. The marvels of Seville are best experienced\
  \ in the old town, where the two main tourist attractions are located \u2013 the\
  \ Seville Cathedral and the Alcazar Castle. Our apartment, located close to these\
  \ two monuments, was set amidst narrow stony pathways, above a cozy pub called \u2018\
  Fabiola\u2019. The wooden doors of the pub opened to a bustling locality, connecting\
  \ the alleys to numerous tapas bars and colorful souvenir shops, leading up to the\
  \ Cathedral. The streets were lined with open tables set out by the restaurants,\
  \ where one could sit and sip on fine wine, while admiring the Moorish architecture.\
  \ Often, men on horse carriages would pass by, inviting tourists to take a ride.\
  \ It was as if we were transported in time!   \n\nWhen we reached our apartment,\
  \ our host, who was also the owner of Fabiola pub, welcomed us in. In fluent Espanol,\
  \ he told us that our apartment was on the second floor. I grasped as much as I\
  \ could, thanks to my newly acquired, half-baked Spanish skills. We were introduced\
  \ to Senora Roja, a lady who took us upstairs and showed us around. Only the Wifi\
  \ password, she said, was to be collected from the owner downstairs. As she left,\
  \ we immediately declared our spots in the room and took out our mobile phones to\
  \ update our Instagram feeds.  \n\nBut of course, the Wifi password was with Mr.\
  \ Fabiola! Naturally, I trudged down to get it at once. \n\nHowever, a strange incident\
  \ happened on my way down. I found Senora Roja, standing a bit startled near the\
  \ kitchen on the first floor. Her nose was bleeding profusely! I immediately rushed\
  \ to help her. But all she asked me was to get somebody from downstairs. \n\nThis\
  \ was a task I had not seen coming. I had to communicate that she was bleeding from\
  \ her nose and needed help, but in Spanish! I did not have my phone and had to act\
  \ quickly. I thought, even if I could mention bleeding, the task would be won. But\
  \ alas! My amateur Spanish dictionary was not prepared to spit out any word remotely\
  \ resembling \u2018blood\u2019.\n\nJust then, my mind drifted to the previous evening,\
  \ when we were in the Spanish capital, Madrid. We were at a restaurant and my friend\
  \ had asked the waiter whether they served white, or red sangria. The waiter had\
  \ been aghast hearing this! He had asked us:\n\n\u201CWhite sangria? Where have\
  \ you had a white sangria?\"\n\nWe had tasted white sangria before, which is made\
  \ with white wine and exotic fruits such as green apple, kiwi etc. Many tropical\
  \ countries serve it. But the waiter seemed to disagree. He explained:\n\n\u201C\
  Lady, traditionally, there is no such thing as a white sangria! Sangria means blood.\
  \ Hence, a sangria is always red.\u201D\n\nLike a thunderbolt, I switched back to\
  \ reality, where I was standing with the bleeding lady at our apartment in Seville.\
  \ I knew just what to do! \n\nI ran down, barged into the pub and confidently spoke\
  \ to Mr. Fabiola:\n\n\u201CSenor, un momento por favor\u201D\n\n(\u201CSir, one\
  \ moment please\u201D)\n\n\u201CEsa Mujeres\u2026\u201D\n\n(\u201CThat woman\u201D\
  , I continued, pointing upstairs)\n\nThis much, I knew. However, I did not know\
  \ the Spanish of \u2018nose\u2019. Hence, I simply pointed at my nose and said \u2018\
  sangria\u2019. \n\nHe stared at me, a bit amused. It appeared to him that my nose\
  \ needed some sangria, or that sangria was running down Senora Roja\u2019s nose.\
  \ Not giving a care about what he thought, I repeated the gesture multiple times,\
  \ after which, he finally seemed to understand what had happened. Without further\
  \ ado, he rushed upstairs to help her. \n\nI heaved a sigh of relief and ordered\
  \ for a glass of cerveza (beer) to calm my nerves. After I collected the password\
  \ from the pub, I walked up to find Senora lying down on the first-floor sofa, with\
  \ a kerchief pressed to her nose. She looked at me and smiled saying \u2018gracias\u2019\
  . All was well, that ended well.     \n\nJust in case you were wondering, blood\
  \ in Spanish translates to \u2018sangre\u2019. Hence, I was close. Really close."
