Text: "\u201CAldo, come si dice \u2018sister\u2019?\u201D \n\t\nFrom behind the register,\
  \ he eyes me over his tortoiseshell glasses, his bushy white eyebrows raised.\n\t\
  \n\u201CTu lo sai.\u201D\n\t\nI should have expected that. Aldo, in the short time\
  \ I\u2019ve known him, has not been fond of giving away what must be earned in knowledge.\
  \ Espresso and cantucci consistently fly over the marble countertop and into the\
  \ hands of regulars without so much as a centisimo exchanged, but the answers to\
  \ my nightly Italian homework are a guarded secret. \n\t\nWe met my first week in\
  \ Florence. I had (very unintentionally) arrived the sole attendant in my program\
  \ without a pre-packaged college friend group and spent the first several days bouncing\
  \ from caf\xE9 to caf\xE9, hoping to small talk my way into an international rapport.\
  \ The exercise proved difficult as A) I spoke very little Italian, and B) Coffee\
  \ culture in Florence lacks the leisurely, luxuriating quality of other cities like\
  \ Paris or even New York. You order your espresso at the bar, down it like whiskey,\
  \ and then push back out into the maddening crowds of Ciao Bella t-shirt vendors,\
  \ wonder-struck tourists and everyday locals. Be prepared for highly suspicious\
  \ glances if you settle in with a book. \n\t\nWhen I stepped inside Caff\xE8 Rondinelli,\
  \ tucked on a curving street in the shadow of il Duomo, nothing indicated my experience\
  \ would be any different. Though there was a spacious loft area with seating, not\
  \ a chair had been filled. The espresso bar was occupied, two men and a woman standing\
  \ shoulder to shoulder, waiting patiently for their cappuccino and ristretto. Behind\
  \ the counter, an elderly gentleman moved nimbly about his tasks, wiping down the\
  \ milk foamer, dotting saucers with espresso cups. He had a warm voice that he didn\u2019\
  t feel the need to raise to be heard and handled every part of the transaction with\
  \ gentleness. The customers took their coffee, drank as slowly as custom permitted,\
  \ and then left. \n\t\nHe nodded gravely at me, the remaining onlooker. \u201CBuongiorno,\u201D\
  \ he said. \n\t\n\u201CBuongiorno! Un espresso per favore e\u2026\u201D I looked\
  \ over into the dessert counter. An array of sugar-dusted pastries eyed me back.\
  \ I pointed at one with flaky layers. \u201CUno di questo per favore.\u201D\n\t\n\
  \u201CSfogliatella,\u201D he said. \n\t\n\u201CSafoylahta.\u201D\n\t\n\u201CS-Foh-lee-ah-tay-la!\u201D\
  \ He repeated each syllable with sing-song staccato.\n\t\n\u201CSfoylatella.\u201D\
  \ This attempt earned me a half nod, which I would come to understand as acceptance\
  \ of the passable. \n\t\nWhen I returned the following day, it was with determination\
  \ to present myself as a quick study. \u201CUna sfogliata per favore!\u201D \n\t\
  \n\u201CNo. Sfogliata \xE9 di Napoli. NAPOLI.\u201D Knowing full well which pastry\
  \ I\u2019d originally meant, he waited, hands folded, until I was ready to try my\
  \ pronunciation again. \n\t\n3 months later, I have taken breakfast here nearly\
  \ every day. I have learned about Aldo\u2019s family, who help run the shop and\
  \ continually ask when he will retire. He has told me which hilltop villages to\
  \ visit on my free weekends and which ugly city to avoid (Milano). I have introduced\
  \ him to the concept of a brownie, and he has shown me the care that goes into making\
  \ each defined layer of the sfogliatella. Yet, in the current moment, it feels as\
  \ though no time has passed at all, Aldo\u2019s hands folded as he waits for my\
  \ response. \n\t\n\u201CSister is\u2026Sorella? S\xEC?\u201D\n\t   \nMy reward is\
  \ a smile and the hint of approval in his eyes. \n          \n\u201CBrava, Sarah.\u201D"
