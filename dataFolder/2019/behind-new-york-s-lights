Text: "Having arrived in New York early that morning, jet lag didn\u2019t hit us when\
  \ we journeyed through the bustling city in an attempt to find our hotel and check-in.\
  \ People, though busy and often frustrated that they were stopped, seemed eager\
  \ to help and in a few minutes, we were in a taxi on the way to our new home for\
  \ the new two weeks.\nThe first day,  I was running on pure energy, caffeine and\
  \ adrenaline, as we made as many stops as we could to museums that day. It was a\
  \ grand total of three (more two and a half really). We hadn\u2019t eaten a lot\
  \ if anything apart from our quick coffee break before entering the second museum.\
  \ Spotting the hotdog cart, we muttered to each other but the complaining groan\
  \ of all three stomachs made the decision for us. Eating a quick curbside dinner\
  \ before making my way, with my companions, back to the hotel.\nIt wasn\u2019t until\
  \ that evening that I felt the time difference hit me. Being used to waking up around\
  \ 0600GMT and it being near one in the morning EST (0500GMT) by the time I had settled\
  \ into my bed. I just couldn\u2019t quite find the fatigue in me to drift off to\
  \ sleep. Hurriedly making my way out of bed, I threw on my jeans over my night shorts,\
  \ grabbed my coat, gloves, hat and scarf before wandering out the room once more.\n\
  New York in the early hours of the morning is a different vibe to the daytime. It\u2019\
  s slow, people are still bustling, but more languidly so. I walked down the street,\
  \ aiming to head towards the park and just sit and watch people for a while. However\
  \ as I turned down a dimly lit street, a new side of New York was introduced to\
  \ me.\nYou hear of New York\u2019s homeless population, you see them throughout\
  \ the day. (We gave those me could food and water.) But something about seeing them\
  \ trying to get through a cold evening really is an entirely new shock to your system.\n\
  It seemed I had taken a wrong turn. To which I cursed quietly to myself but as I\
  \ made my way down the streets I couldn\u2019t help but think of some of the lives\
  \ these people had before life handed them a bad card. Clothes that were decorated\
  \ with all sorts of muck and dirt laid against their skin. Most had holes in their\
  \ gloves and hats, whenever the breeze flittered by the tensing of their bodies\
  \ told me that it chilled them to the bone. I could hardly imagine what it must\
  \ have been like.\nAs I approached the end of the dark road that reeked of hopelessness.\
  \ It felt as though everything was getting lighter the closer I got to leave it\
  \ all behind. As though the struggles, pain and hardship these people were facing\
  \ had latched onto my shoulders when I started making my way down. I watched a hand\
  \ shift ever so slightly on my left. I trailed my eyes down and saw a young woman\u2019\
  s figure curled up in an old blanket. She couldn't have been much older than me,\
  \ that\u2019s what was most frightening. Like the others, her coat was ripped and\
  \ it looked more like a fashion coat more than anything. Immediately reaching up\
  \ to tear my scarf off from around my neck and promptly offered it to her. It took\
  \ her a moment\u2019s hesitation to realised the situation. My heart broke at the\
  \ look of fear and distrust on her face. But carefully, she took the scarf from\
  \ my hands. After this acceptance, I did the same with my gloves and hat ensuring\
  \ she was somewhat warmer. \nHer gentle \u2018thank you\u2019 carried me through\
  \ the rest of my New York trip. I came seeking culture and what better way to learn\
  \ about New York living that to watch those trying to survive the streets of New\
  \ York every day. Thinking back of my experience, I often find myself sad that I\
  \ didn\u2019t get their story but I\u2019m thankful I made that small connection.\
  \ Gives me an aim for my next visit."
