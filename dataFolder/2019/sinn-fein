Text: "As I make my way through the narrow halls at Kilmainham Goal, my white dress\
  \ lightly billowing in the cool spring air, it takes all of my strength to will\
  \ my feet forward. My footsteps fall heavy on the cobble stone under foot; the sound\
  \ echoing as it reverberates through me. This life we have shared, our love, it\
  \ all comes to a crashing halt at dawn.  \nMy heart pounds in my ears. With each\
  \ step my anxiety grows; how can it be that the total sum of our lives has equalled\
  \ to this moment? \nOh, my love! How I long for your touch, the taste of your kiss,\
  \ the calm of your eyes. It would appear our grandiose notions of a free Ireland\
  \ have cost us more than our lives. \n\nMy mind races as I wait for you in this\
  \ dimly lit chapel. The priest, just beyond my field of vision, is readying himself\
  \ to welcome the felon inside his house of God. The chapel doors open as two men\
  \ escort you in. Cuffs adorn your wrists, your face hardened in bravery, as a quiet\
  \ desperation permeates the room. The air is charged with all of the things we aren\u2019\
  t permitted to speak, with every touch we aren\u2019t permitted to act upon; our\
  \ expression of love having been distilled to fit the confines of our circumstance.\
  \ Our eyes meet and never falter. The only words spoken; \u201CI, Grace Gifford,\
  \ take you, Joseph Plunkett, for my lawful husband, to have and to hold from this\
  \ day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health,\
  \ until death do us part.\"\n\n\nWalking the halls lined with cells barely wide\
  \ enough to stretch out in, knowing that those spaces were the last place many people\
  \ lived, gives a haunting pause to those walking through. Though the jail was primarily\
  \ used for petty thieves and other lowly criminals, it\u2019s famous for the political\
  \ prisoners it housed during the tumultuous uprising of Easter 1916. As you make\
  \ your way through the different levels of the jail, you see the very cells in which\
  \ the leaders of the Easter Uprising were held. No beds, no furniture- just a bucket\
  \ for waste and a small opening in the brick for airflow.  This jail would be the\
  \ end of the line for the leaders of the uprising; their cells amplifying the bleakness\
  \ of their end. \n\nKilmainham Gaol (pronounced \u2018jail\u2019) was never intended\
  \ to be a high profile establishment. Built in 1796, Kilmainham was meant to be\
  \ a place where order was restored to the prison environment. It was meant to work\
  \ under the motto of the three S\u2019s. Solitary, Silence and Supervision. That\
  \ meant, one inmate per cell, who was not to speak- which in turn made it easier\
  \ for the guards to watch over everyone.\nHad it remained as such, merely a place\
  \ for common criminals and petty thieves, Kilmainham would not have warranted the\
  \ place in history it now holds. \n\nFollowing Easter week in May 1916, all fourteen\
  \ of the Easter Uprising leaders were executed by British firing squad. Thirteen\
  \ as they stood lined up and the last, James Connolly, who was injured in the battle,\
  \ was wheeled in and strapped to a chair on the opposite side of the stone-breakers\
  \ yard. \nFourteen crosses mark their resting place. \nThough these events transpired\
  \ over one-hundred years ago, there is still a palpable sense of dread that haunts\
  \ the grounds where these men were slaughtered. It\u2019s easy to get caught up\
  \ in the moment and imagine oneself as an inmate, to feel the fire of solidarity\
  \ for the right to a free Ireland being ignited in oneself. The spirits of the men\
  \ slain in their valiant fight for a free Ireland seem not to have not slackened\
  \ in their resolve; the stone-breakers yard, though dreadful as it is, is also saturated\
  \ with an unmistakable energy for change."
