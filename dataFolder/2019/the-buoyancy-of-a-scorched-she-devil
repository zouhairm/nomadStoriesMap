Text: "We were going to burn a witch. Tram 15 was alive with shuffling feet and restless\
  \ energy, crammed to bursting with Czechs looking to take revenge on winter. The\
  \ little girl in front of me tilted her pointy hat and curled her hands into claws\
  \ and shrieked into her brother\u2019s face. A shush came swiftly, flung down by\
  \ a woman in a synthetic purple wig. \n\n\tI smiled as I watched the girl make faces\
  \ in the window, holding onto every piece of Prague that I could. I was getting\
  \ ready to move back to America, exactly four and a half months after I had touched\
  \ down at the Vaclav Havel airport and met my best friends, amidst the fear of knowing\
  \ no one in a foreign country where I had never been before. But after a semester\
  \ spent in the Czech capital, I felt that I was leaving home, not returning to it.\

  ,\u201D echoed the robotic warning that our stop was next. The six of us piled out\
  \ of the tram and onto the cobbled streets of Mal\xE1 Strana. The narrow alleyways\
  \ were packed with costumed people in plague masks and medieval tunics who swarmed\
  \ past us by the hundreds. The Lesser Quarter was ablaze with ceremonial torches\
  \ and pink-cheeked adrenaline. A parade was winding through the streets, and the\
  \ drum beat grew louder, more frantic, as the wind picked up. Ibs offered me his\
  \ jacket, but I wasn\u2019t cold-- we were together, we were halfway around the\
  \ world from home, and we were going to burn a witch. \n\nThe last night of April\
  \ is a transitional period in Bohemian culture, when they cast off winter\u2019\
  s icy grip and usher in springtime with open arms. P\xE1len\xED \u010Darod\u011B\
  jnic is rooted in pagan tradition, when giant bonfires are lit as a way to ward\
  \ off the evil spirits who want to rob the people of their warmth and happiness;\
  \ it is the turning of the page between chapters. As the straw witches ignite, the\
  \ country thaws, and life starts anew. \n\nJostling elbows and deep chanting guided\
  \ us to an open square with a wooden pyre in the center. The crowd gathered tightly\
  \ around the structure, energy simmering like a pot of water due to boil over. I\
  \ linked elbows with my friends, and the six of us huddled near the front, ready\
  \ for the flames. \n\nShe lit quickly. The blaze started low, spreading up her scarecrow\
  \ legs and straight on to the crown of her head. Her loose rags were no match for\
  \ the inferno, disintegrating as quickly as the paper-mache face that sat atop her\
  \ shoulders. The moon rose with the heat, and the white light gave her a halo as\
  \ she collapsed into herself. I squeezed Caitlin\u2019s arm tighter as I realized\
  \ I needed to let go. \n\nWe burned a witch, and she saddled her pockets with our\
  \ coldness and sadness and fear and took them to ashes with her. The smoke rose\
  \ from the pyre into the bruised sky, trailing over the Golden City of a Hundred\
  \ Spires like a phantom. The revelry only intensified once the deed was done, and\
  \ adults and children alike danced around the square, shrieking into the face of\
  \ endless opportunity, staring into a blank slate. The end of one chapter is always\
  \ the beginning of the next. \n\n\u201CNa schledanou!\u201D We called out to the\
  \ night. \u201CDekuju!\u201D Goodbye, and thank you."
