Text: "In Kazakhstan my parents go each year at the end of August, my dad paraglider\
  \ and there are numerous competition. One of these is held near Almaty, the old\
  \ capital of Kazakhstan, though as for me it was Almaty this capital, city more\
  \ alive and the present than Astana, but not about it ... \nIn this year I decided\
  \ to the first time to went with them. For its relatively short life I visited a\
  \ large number of countries, more than 20,  I was in the South-East Asia, Africa,\
  \ visited a large number of the European countries, and when I went in this journey,\
  \ I do not expect to see here something unusual. As I was wrong.\nAll started with\
  \ tremendous nature. Mountain! And again mountains! Such a stunning scenery I do\
  \ not seen never, is that in the Caucasus. Everything was impregnated stunning atmosphere\
  \ of freedom. Snow the top, floating Eagles, wind which walk on infinite Kazakh\
  \ steppes, all of this could not do not capture the spirit. But the main beauty\
  \ of my travel was not in this. People! What are the great people inhabit this country!\
  \ Started with the fact that the my younger brother was bad, he has had a sunny\
  \ blow. We were 50 km from the nearest amenities of the community and did not know\
  \ what to do, but passing people could not US not to help. The first machine which\
  \ see us stopped and took on to the hospital, despite the fact that before that\
  \ they went to the other side. Moreover, they have not just took us to hospital\
  \ , they gave his phone just in case and said that we can call in every time . But\
  \ at this beautiful people in Kazakhstan not have ended. \nAfter each start paraglider\
  \ sits on a different distance  from the finish and their all need to pick up. For\
  \ selection stands out big Kamaz and somehow I once went along with his driver.\
  \ Turned out so that we arrived at 3 hours before, as well as he was a local, he\
  \ went to his home. All expensive while we went, I thought, what he will do with\
  \ me? I will sit in the car? Wait on the Street? Probably in Russia it can happen\
  \ , but he let me to himself home, and his wife seeing me the first time and said\
  \ only one: Are you hungry? I said \u201CNo\u201D, but it is not care her, she covered\
  \ table on which it was a huge amount of food, I never so much do not eat. Moreover,\
  \ they I was forced there! It was the most pleasant torment in my life. When we\
  \ went back to the car, his wife gave me a huge cart with fruit, which grew at them\
  \ on the backyard. It was amazing, like attitude to another's a person i've seen\
  \ only in the books. Kazakhstan truly incredible country and so it makes its people.\
  \ In spite of its distance I recommend all visit this country and find out what\
  \ is Kazakh hospitality!"
