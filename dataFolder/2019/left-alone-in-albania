Text: "Well I had an interesting morning ...\nOur tour bus stopped at a service station\
  \ halfway between Tirana and Berat for passengers to use the toilets. I was the\
  \ last one and when I came out, hmmmm ... no bus. I thought these guys were playing\
  \ a joke on me so I walked behind the gas station and hmmmm... no bus. Then I went\
  \ up to the coffee counter and the server made hand gestures demonstrating that\
  \ the bus indeed had driven off.\n\nHmmmm...\n\nYou are asking \u201CDidn\u2019\
  t your mother notice you were gone? Apparently not - though I always sit in the\
  \ seat beside her. Later she said she thought the Chinese woman at the front of\
  \ the bus was me. Hmmmm - probably because we look so much alike.\n\nSo here I am\
  \ in Albania in the middle of Nowhere - that\u2019s with a capital N - and I have\
  \ to figure out how to get to Berat. \nBut first I ordered an espresso and smoked\
  \ a cigar - there are priorities, you know - and considered my options. I couldn\u2019\
  t reach my tour guide on my phone but someone in the coffee bar offered to call\
  \ her. It took about 15 minutes but we finally connected. \nIn the meantime, a nice\
  \ Albanian man who looked like Tony Soprano and who didn\u2019t speak any English\
  \ somehow understood that I needed to get to Berat. He called a friend of his who\
  \ said he would drive me. \n\nHmmmm...\n\nSo the friend drove up to the service\
  \ station about 20 minutes later in a beat-up Mercedes that needed a bath. I made\
  \ sure the nice Albanian man called my guide to give her his friend\u2019s number\
  \ - you know, just in case my body ended up floating in the Adriatic Sea.\nSo after\
  \ a stop at the Albanian version of the Apple store (so he could get a SIM card)\
  \ and after a stop at the gas station (because he had none), we were on our way.\
  \ For the next hour, my driver would maniacally point to every road sign that read\
  \ \"Berat\" -- apparently his way of reassuring me that I was NOT being kidnapped.\n\
  Eventually, I arrived safe and sound at Berat Castle -- though, truth be told, I\
  \ needed a chiropractor after that ride. There to greet me was my guide, offering\
  \ profuse apologies; my mother, offering lame excuses; and my fellow travelers,\
  \ cheering my victory by buying me the first of many rounds that day. It was 11\
  \ a.m."
