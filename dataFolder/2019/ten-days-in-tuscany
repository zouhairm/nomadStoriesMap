Text: "For ten days in July and August 2016, I inhabited paradise. So it seemed to\
  \ me. My mother\u2019s Belgian cousin and his partner had rented a villa for three\
  \ weeks in the Tuscan countryside. We\u2014my parents, my younger brother, and myself\u2014\
  had been invited to stay one week, along with his father (my mother\u2019s \u201C\
  Uncle Peter\u201D), his sister, her husband, and their two boys. And so long as\
  \ we were in Italy, my mother thought, we might as well to see some else of what\
  \ the country had to offer. A small fraction, of course: we were to remain in Tuscany.\
  \ But we would see Lucca, Siena, and Florence, as well as various hill towns, like\
  \ Montepulciano and Cortona. \n\tI knew next to nothing about Italy, beyond what\
  \ I\u2019d seen in The Borgias. I suggested we watch some Fellini movies in preparation,\
  \ but my mother pointed out that they were mostly set in Rome, rather than Tuscany.\
  \ Instead we watched A Room with a View. What I took from that film, or what I was\
  \ supposed to take, I can\u2019t recall. It didn\u2019t do much to fill out my sketchy\
  \ vision of what Italy was like, unless the country hadn\u2019t changed since the\
  \ Edwardian era. What could I expect? What could I look forward to? I remember most\
  \ of all what I wanted was to see Botticelli\u2019s Primavera in the Uffizi Gallery\
  \ in Florence. (I did see it, but only at a distance: the room was crowded with\
  \ selfie-stick-wielding tourists impossible to squeeze past.) Beyond that, I had\
  \ no idea.\n\tFirst was Lucca, birthplace of Giacomo Puccini. We stayed at a hotel\
  \ outside the walls of the old city, inaccessible to cars; just before sunset we\
  \ entered, in search of a meal. That first night we sat in the middle of a square,\
  \ quaffing glasses of wine, feasting on bread and meat and cheese. The next day\
  \ we returned, visiting Puccini\u2019s apartment, walking along the wall, and briefly\
  \ stopping in a cathedral, where I picked up my first souvenir: a postcard with\
  \ a picture of Saint Sebastian, arms tied behind his back, pierced through with\
  \ arrows. \n\tThough I didn\u2019t venture to the top of Siena\u2019s Torre del\
  \ Mangia, I was able to see from the hotel roof a remarkable view over the hills\
  \ of the countryside, cast in brilliant shades of red and gold. Later, standing\
  \ on the transept of the unfinished cathedral, I had a similar vantage point over\
  \ the city itself. I couldn\u2019t keep myself from peering into windows and onto\
  \ balconies. What I saw wasn\u2019t interesting\u2014quotidian details of life,\
  \ laundry hung out to dry. A tourist city, wreathed in semi-mythic history, can\
  \ seem impenetrable to outsiders. These small details changed my perspective: Lucca\
  \ and Siena weren\u2019t merely historical marvels, but living communities, constantly\
  \ changing.\n\tFrom the villa in Cetona we made several excursions to surrounding\
  \ hill towns. In Cortona I made the climb to the very top of the hill, where the\
  \ Medici built a fortress; again I had a remarkable view over the countryside, which\
  \ seemed limitlessly vast. In all my life some perimeter had surrounded me, a dense\
  \ thicket of trees or a maze of skyscrapers. Only there did the world appear to\
  \ me as a true Cartesian plane, a place of infinite possibility and wonder. \nOn\
  \ our final days, we were in Florence. The morning we left I went out early and\
  \ crossed the Arno. I saw the city asleep, as if empty; I met no one. Crossing the\
  \ bridge back to the hotel where we stayed I felt a great sense of melancholy, as\
  \ if I\u2019d already left Tuscany behind. In a way, I suppose, I had: I had crossed\
  \ from ignorance to knowledge, and if I ever returned the streets would not look\
  \ the same, nor the houses nor even the cathedrals. Perhaps not even that god\u2019\
  s-eye-view would remain: vanished forever was the sense that there was a future\
  \ ahead of me, and a past which had passed under the horizon."
