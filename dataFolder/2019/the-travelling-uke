Text: "I\u2019m not sure which was the moment the real adventure begun. Maybe it was\
  \ during that breakfast with my friend Sofia, when we compared our schedules and\
  \ realized that in November we could have the same three weeks off. Maybe it was\
  \ when we booked the plane ticket through the Garuda Indonesia website. Or when\
  \ we landed in Singapore, falling in love with the city way more than we would expect.\
  \ Maybe it was when an Indonesian driver brought us from Denpasar airport to Canngu,\
  \ Bali, and with car windows open we lied our eyes on its exotic landscapes. I could\
  \ say the adventure begun on that day in Ubud, when we rented a motorbike and wandered\
  \ through the forest, without a single care in the world. Most likely, it begun\
  \ when we dropped off the boat in front of Gili Meno, a few meters from the coast\
  \ and, with the shoes in one hand, we dipped our feet in the warmest ocean water\
  \ human beings have ever experienced, being careful not to wet our heavy backpacks,\
  \ to reach the shore.\nI didn\u2019t know it yet, how long a short day and night\
  \ spent on that remote small island, the farthest from home I had ever been, would\
  \ have been stuck with me; but I had a hint of it as soon as I crossed his eyes.\
  \ \nHe was standing by the tourist port, trying to foul foreigners, \u201Cbule\u201D\
  , as they are called by Indonesians, with his smiley eyes, barefoot and topless,\
  \ wearing just a pair of shorts and carrying an old guitar, that he used to convince\
  \ people to give him some rupias. And, I gotta say, he was pretty good at it. \n\
  Adika was his name, as we found out later when, after going to our bungalows to\
  \ drop our backpacks and having a quick swim into the ocean, we came back to the\
  \ tourist port, apparently the only place where restaurants could be found on the\
  \ island. \nIt was the three of us, me, Sofia, and my ukulele, my loyal travel mate\
  \ which had kept me company during all my adventures in the previous year or so.\
  \ It wasn't even my best ukulele, and yet my favorite one, cause being the cheapest\
  \ and smallest I could easily bring it with me when I travelled. It was covered\
  \ with stickers from all the places I had travelled to since I had got it. Greece,\
  \ Jordan, Morocco, and now Singapore and Indonesia had their permanent spot on its\
  \ once plain yellow surface. \nWe slowly walked by a few restaurants, enjoying the\
  \ warmth of the night, the calmness of the ocean and the smell of grilled fish coming\
  \ from the kitchens. We had just grabbed a Bintang -the local beer- in a small store\
  \ when the sound of a guitar drew our attention.\nWe looked across the street and\
  \ there he was, sitting with Australian tourists and entertaining them with famous\
  \ songs. We made eye contact, he noticed my ukulele hanging from my shoulder and\
  \ invited us to join them. I wasn't that great musician, but I knew all the main\
  \ chords and a few strumming patterns to follow along. His eastern eyes, the warm\
  \ tone of his skin and the magic touch of his fingers on that strings -improved\
  \ by months of exercise when the wet season hit Indonesia and, being Gili Meno a\
  \ touristic islands, he had nothing to do than playing his guitar, interrupted only\
  \ by his one per day bowl of rice meal- made me let my guard down. I kept it down\
  \ later that night, when we ran on the beach, fluorescent plankton under our feet\
  \ and stars glazing above our heads, drinking local rice wine, holding hands and\
  \ laughing like we had known each other forever. \nI only realized how naive I had\
  \ been the next morning when, on the boat back to Bali, I found out my traveling\
  \ uke was missing."
