Text: "First off, I\u2019d like to start my story by introducing myself whom in this\
  \ story is the main character. My names Hayley, I\u2019m a 22 year old university\
  \ student who\u2019s mind was opened on one particular day. \n\nI started my days\
  \ off usually waking up with a cup of coffee and going to class, then usually on\
  \ the weekends I would uphold a social status and go out with my university friends\
  \ even though I\u2019d much rather be home watching my Netflix series that I\u2019\
  d be addicted on. Soon, my priorities changed and my lifestyle changes due to going\
  \ out and I got so caught up with the materialistic things in this world rather\
  \ than the important things. I think the cause of this was that I lost myself in\
  \ the repetition of my lifestyle. I started going out more and not like it\u2019\
  s a bad thing but I was trying to find myself in places that I shouldn\u2019t have\
  \ been in the first place. I eventually lost some friends and failed some classes\
  \ and it led to the turmoil that changed my life. \n\nOne day, I came home from\
  \ class extremely stressed out that I started crying. I didn\u2019t know what was\
  \ wrong and why I was crying, first off, I didn\u2019t know why my life was like\
  \ this and I started to think if this is what life is. I wondered if life is just\
  \ us, going to university to find jobs just to survive to the end of our time. I\
  \ wanted to find happiness and true meaning in life, I wanted to that joy in life.\
  \ I did some real thinking for the past 2 months and that\u2019s when I came to\
  \ the conclusion that maybe my mind was small minded since I\u2019ve never went\
  \ anywhere. I decided on that particular day, to go to Cuba. I know Cuba isn\u2019\
  t big or anything but for me, it was my first travel experi nice...alone. I ended\
  \ up booking a week vacation on Cuba alone and flew out the following 2 weeks. On\
  \ the night before my flight, I was so nervous and anxious for what was to come.\
  \ On my way to the airport, I started to question everything and if it was a smart\
  \ idea to go alone but once I got to the airport this excitment came into my life\
  \ and I loved that feeling. I boarded my plane and headed for Cuba! When I landed\
  \ in Cuba and got to my resort, it was a culture shock. I seen the people and the\
  \ differences in our lives. As I headed to the resort, I seen that the people were\
  \ struggling but they still seemed happy. I started to think about my life and how\
  \ I have all these amenities that the people in Cuba would be grateful to have.\
  \ I started to think about how I have taken these things for granted, I was thinking\
  \ about all the water I waste and how much food I throw away at the end of the week.\
  \ This trip for me going to Cuba opened my mind to the reality of the world and\
  \ how perspectives in life can change you. I became grateful and this is where my\
  \ travel experience opened. After my Cuba trip, I traveled more alone. I met some\
  \ amazing people who told me about theirselves and that opened my mind to how different\
  \ peoples lives are. I met some people who introduced me to some good books and\
  \ those books opened my eyes more. I realize that not only our perspective have\
  \ an impact on our emotions but we create our own negativity and that negativity\
  \ I created before I traveled was my mental state at the time. I was creating the\
  \ negativity in my life and thought I was lost, I realized I need to be more open\
  \ with my life and change my perspective on things. I\u2019m not saying traveling\
  \ is the key nor reading but I feel like it\u2019s meeting people. I feel like our\
  \ social interactions and how we interact has a meaningful impact on a persons life."
