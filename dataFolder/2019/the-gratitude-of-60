Text: "Ting\u2026 a notification showed up on my phone:  the free seat promotion from\
  \ a low-cost airline. My thumb clicked the phone before I knew it, chose the destination\
  \ randomly, and chose the dates around my birthday. A few seconds later, I already\
  \ bought a round-trip ticket to Singapore for nearly 60 dollars. I smiled \u2013\
  \ knowing I will have my first solo trip ever while celebrating my quarter-life\
  \ birthday. \n\n\u201CTo travel is to take a journey into yourself,\u201D Danny\
  \ Kaye, the legendary actor and comedian, once said \u2013 words I loved so much.\
  \ Now \u2013 right before I live on another quarter of life \u2013 is the best moment\
  \ to take a journey into myself. And Singapore: with the grandeur Marina Bay Sands,\
  \ beautiful waterfront gardens, mixed culture, and various foods, will be the right\
  \ place to explore.\n\nThe first day finally came and my excitement was in the air.\
  \ I woke up early, carried my 33 liters backpack, and managed to arrive at the airport\
  \ in 3 hours before my flight. While waiting in the gatehouse, I saw a man carrying\
  \ his backpack on his shoulders and was looked confused where to return his empty\
  \ trolley. I immediately came to him and showed him a point of the returned trolleys.\
  \ He smiled and we began talking about many things before we knew it. We got along\
  \ well and became much better as we sat next to each other in the plane. He shared\
  \ his solo trip experiences \u2013 to more than 80 countries in the world \u2013\
  \ which made our two and a half hours flight like a flash.\n\nArriving in Singapore,\
  \ we split our way as we booked different hostels. I was back alone but we had a\
  \ pretty good time together. \u201CThe journey just begins,\u201D I told myself.\
  \ I checked in to Wink Capsule Hostel, a hidden gem in the heart of Chinatown. My\
  \ pod has a comfortable bed with warm ambiance back-light, personal power socket,\
  \ and reading LED light. Every afternoon I had brunch in the kitchenette and made\
  \ friends with other customers from different countries.\n\nI spent my birthday\
  \ evening in the glamorous Marina Bay Sands. I sat down in the Event Plaza, allowed\
  \ myself for self-reflection while watching sunset between the buildings and waters\
  \ on Marina Bay. It was a beautiful evening, merely beautiful. When the building\
  \ lights were in, I began pouring my self-reflection into drawing and writing in\
  \ my journal.  The night became perfect with Spectra \u2013 the 15 minutes light\
  \ and water show that left me mesmerized with the beautiful symphony of dancing\
  \ fountain jets, lasers, mists, and colorful visual projections. I genuinely loved\
  \ the stunning show \u2013 to the point that made me watched the show twice that\
  \ night.\n\nOn the next day, I explored the hustle and bustle of Pagoda Street \u2013\
  \ the main street of Chinatown. I visited herbal and traditional medicine shops,\
  \ did window shopping of many souvenir shops, and bought a $1 souvenir coin from\
  \ the Chinatown Heritage Centre. My lunch became fantastic with the soy sauce chicken\
  \ rice with roast pork from Liao Fan Hawker Chan, the world\u2019s first Michelin\
  \ Star hawker. \n\nAs I walked to South Bridge Road, I visited Sri Mariamman Temple\
  \ that built in 1827. The city\u2019s oldest Hindu temple featured a tower densely\
  \ decorated with gods and goddesses. The Chinatown ambiance didn\u2019t stop there;\
  \ I also explored the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum \u2013 a five-floor temple\
  \ with a meditation hall, museums, and ten thousand buddhas pagoda. On the roof,\
  \ there was a Vairocana Buddha prayer wheel. We can hold the wheel, walked clockwise\
  \ and slowly \u2013 while saying our gratitude and wishes to Buddha. People believed\
  \ that doing the prayer wheel three times will make your wishes come true.\n\nI\
  \ spent the third day by relaxing in the chill-out room of my hostel. I was surprised\
  \ by how I get used to my own company during the trip \u2013 and at the same time:\
  \ how naturally I get along and talk with new people. This solo trip allowed more\
  \ time to be completely myself and take in all my surroundings. I flew back home\
  \ with a grateful heart and dozens of plans for further solo trips."
