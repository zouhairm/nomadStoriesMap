Text: "\u201CDid you guys steal the toe?\u201D one of my friends asked on Facebook\
  \ with a link to an article that read more like a \u201CWANTED\u201D poster.\n\n\
  Just days earlier we had crossed the border leaving Chicken, Alaska (yes, it\u2019\
  s called Chicken and supposedly given the name in honor of the local hen-like ptarmigan,\
  \ a name early gold miners couldn\u2019t spell\u2014I don\u2019t blame them for\
  \ keeping it simple). My husband and I would be working at Chicken Gold Camp and\
  \ RV Park all summer. One of many odd jobs included pouring beer as multi-colored\
  \ marshmallow Peeps fell from a prop plane circling overhead during the community\u2019\
  s annual Chickenstock music festival. Normal day-to-day duties involved checking\
  \ in RVers as well as visitors eager to take home a shiny piece of earth, that same\
  \ \u201Cyeller gold\u201D the initial miners missed in the late 1800s.\n\nWe crossed\
  \ into the Yukon 40 minutes from our off-the-grid summer retreat, which was completely\
  \ dependent upon generator power and only connected to the outside world via satellite\
  \ phones and Wifi. Think dial-up. As we crossed into the similarly scarce Canadian\
  \ outback known as the Yukon, also famed for its involvement in the gold rush of\
  \ the 1800s, my husband and I kept our eyes peeled for bears and other wildlife.\
  \ Our pickup rumbled up the gravelly pass known as the Top of the World Highway\
  \ and lead us straight into Dawson City. We passed an old wooden outpost with a\
  \ small airstrip and a couple of cyclists pedaling at a sloth-like pace. Taking\
  \ pity, we pulled over and my husband asked if they wanted a ride. \n\n\u201CNo,\
  \ we\u2019re fine,\u201D the man answered as his female counterpart looked at us\
  \ with pleading eyes. \u201CHelp. Me.\u201D She seemed to say. We pressed on another\
  \ hour leaving the woman and her soon-to-be-ex boyfriend in our dust.\n\nFinally,\
  \ we weaved down into a river valley that met up with the Yukon River and a complimentary\
  \ ferry ride to the other side. During certain times of year, Dawson City is completely\
  \ cut off from the outside world. Between summer and the freeze, there is no way\
  \ in or out. Even with the ferry in operation, it could be a sluggish process crossing\
  \ the river as the ferry can only take a handful of vehicles on each trip\u2014\
  a caravan of RVs coming through could take up to six hours carrying just one or\
  \ two Class A diesels at a time.\n\nMy husband and I checked into our old-timely\
  \ saloon-style hotel then roamed around the Western-front town expecting some rough\
  \ and rowdy miners to come bustling through with pistols and gold pokes at any moment.\
  \ Instead, it was the typical touristy kitsch and history petrified in time. The\
  \ only task luring us in while in Dawson City was to join the Sourtoe Cocktail Club.\
  \ The Sourtoe was not so much a club as a means of fraternity hazing; take a shot\
  \ of alcohol containing a human toe. Not just any toe though\u2014a toe that had\
  \ been lost to frostbite by a resident of the Yukon. There were only so many donors;\
  \ therefore, the toes were something of a treasure worth thousands to the hotel\
  \ pedaling aperitifs of Piggy in J\xE4germeister, Goldschl\xE4ger Digit Delight\
  \ and Vodka ala Phalanx.\n\nA group of German tourists huddled around waiting for\
  \ someone to dip their own toes into this outlandish club. Lucky for them, my husband\
  \ and I stepped up and offered our lips for a fungal souvenir. We both chose Goldschlager,\
  \ an ode to the gold miners who founded Dawson City. Out came the blackened toe\
  \ on a bed of salt crystals looking more like something you\u2019d scoop from a\
  \ kitty litter box. The keeper of the toe recited her infamous lines, mentioning\
  \ that \u201Cit must touch your lip\u201D as she plopped the cured appendage into\
  \ my shot glass. Scrunching my nose, I shot it down, swallowing the gold-flecked\
  \ liquid while pursing my lips enough to keep the toe at bay.\n\nThat same weekend\
  \ the toe was stolen. A few days later it was mailed back from Chicken, Alaska."
