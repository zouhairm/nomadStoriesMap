Text: "Flip flops, rubber and foam that prevents us from walking on the hot sand,\
  \ protecting our feet from whatever danger lies beneath are the epitome of happiness.\
  \ To a child, flip flops can be the reason for smiling.\n\nIn an orphanage, near\
  \ the capital of Sri Lanka, Colombo, children play. The sand of their playground\
  \ covers their legs as they kick a deflated football. A jungle gym in the courtyard\
  \ of the building is rusted and broken and the children sit and talk upon it instead\
  \ of using it in their games. The children are orphans of the 2004 tsunami, or their\
  \ parents can only afford to keep them for the weekends, so they spend the weekdays\
  \ here. To them, new volunteers are like shiny toys, people to talk to and laugh\
  \ at when they can not understand what they are saying. The children run around\
  \ and ask us to say English words that they\u2019ve learnt, pointing towards the\
  \ things they want to show us and try to explain the games they want to play.\n\
  A disabled child is yelled at for behaving in a way he can not help. In the western\
  \ world he would have had someone to support him and help from an early age. Here,\
  \ he has been disregarded as a misbehaving child rather than accepted and helped\
  \ for who he is. Other children ruin his notebook, tear his drawings and laugh as\
  \ he cries. There is nothing we can do, it is not our place. The boy collects the\
  \ scraps of paper, finds a pencil and continues to draw, cupping his hand around\
  \ the page and hiding it whenever another child passes him. \n\nAnother volunteer\
  \ comes over and tells me about our friend who is crying. The children cling on\
  \ to me as I walk to her, the blaring heat causing the sweat to run down my head\
  \ and stain my clothes. I find her, sobbing, staring at a child who sits in the\
  \ shade by herself. After speaking to my crying friend, I learn that the child was\
  \ hit repeatedly with a shoe. It had something to do with her sitting in the bedroom\
  \ alone. She sat the way we all do, alone in our rooms for some space away from\
  \ the busyness and she was punished. \n\nA woman working at the orphanage pulls\
  \ aside one of the volunteers, interrogating her about why we are there. The volunteer\
  \ doesn\u2019t know what to say other than to help. The woman leaves her and calls\
  \ the children over for snack time. The children run to the orphanage employees\
  \ who hold trays of balled treats. The balls look like brown sponges to you and\
  \ me, but as the children bit in to them, they were delighted in a snack that confused\
  \ us.\nThe next day we bought in notebooks, pencils and stickers for the children.\
  \ I was asked if I would like to hand them out, I decided not to, knowing that I\
  \ did not bring enough for every child. By the end of the day, torn pages floated\
  \ along the sand and stickers littered the faces of the children. They all smiled\
  \ and swapped stickers or stole them from one another. They ran and played every\
  \ day, as different children sat in the shade alone, having been told they had misbehaved\
  \ or simply craving the loneliness that didn\u2019t come with crowds made up of\
  \ volunteers and children. \n\nIn the following days, other volunteers bought things\
  \ for the children, stationary, toys and soap. Then there were the flip flops. I\
  \ turned towards the walkway nearest the offices of\xAC\xAC the orphanage to see\
  \ volunteers handing out flip flops to the children. A girl\u2014 an eight-year-old\
  \ who appeared little older than four \u2013 slipped in to pink flip flops and jumped\
  \ up and down on the concrete floor. Her smile was wider than any other smile around\
  \ her as the spongy shoe shielded her feet from the ground.\n\nThe next day, her\
  \ feet were bare, and another child wore her flip flops."
