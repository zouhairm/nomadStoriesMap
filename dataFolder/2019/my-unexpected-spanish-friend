Text: "Growing up and learning Spanish in Texas, I always imagined that Spaniards\
  \ were jovial, friendly, outgoing and welcoming people. When I went to college,\
  \ I knew I wanted to study abroad in Spain so I could further enhance my Spanish\
  \ speaking skills, and immerse myself in Spanish culture by way of food and friendship.\
  \ I chose to study abroad in Valencia, a coastal city in Spain where the modern\
  \ architecture of the Museo de las Ciencias mixes seamlessly with the Roman architecture\
  \ of the old town plaza. On the walk home to my apartment near the Estacio del Nord\
  \ train station, I pass by a 3-D movie theater, a bullring built in the 1850s and\
  \ a myriad of street side cafes filled with beautiful, young Spaniards sporting\
  \ cool hairstyles and funky outfits. The city was young and lively with an old soul.\
  \ \n\nI was thrilled to start my semester at the University of Valencia. However,\
  \ my first day of school was rough. No one spoke to me. No one welcomed me. No one\
  \ sat next to me. I was profoundly an outsider. Not only was I an American, but\
  \ I was also a Vietnamese American. I not only spoke differently, but I also looked\
  \ differently than my peers. I noticed a girl in my class that I thought I could\
  \ befriend. After school, I sat on the steps outside trying to make conversation\
  \ with her. With my limited Spanish, we did not get very far and she did not seem\
  \ interested in continuing the conversation. So, our friendship ended before it\
  \ ever began. \n\nWalking along the wide paths of Valencia, I looked longingly into\
  \ the windows of cafes and restaurants. I would pass by the bocadillo shops where\
  \ they sold Spanish style deli sandwiches on fresh baked baguettes; little corner\
  \ diners where businessmen stood to have their morning espresso. I longed for friends\
  \ to go to those places to enjoy a meal and a conversation. Not having friends or\
  \ much of a social life allowed me to explore more on my own. My favorite places\
  \ to go were my local grocery store and the beautiful train station. In the grocery\
  \ store, I discovered delightful Spanish staples like jamon iberico, golden olive\
  \ oil, manchego cheese and the Spanish tortilla. Being from a Vietnamese culture,\
  \ I was homesick for Vietnamese meals that were largely composed of fish sauce and\
  \ soy sauce. To my pleasant surprise, I discovered a few local Chinese grocery stores\
  \ that carried both of these hard to find items, and I was able to re-create some\
  \ of my favorite Vietnamese dishes at home. \n\nIn class, I sat next to an older\
  \ classmate named Marisol. Like me, she was not a traditional student as she was\
  \ much older than the rest of our classmates. She embodied the type of personality\
  \ I perceived Spaniards to have; she was open, friendly, generous and kind. We became\
  \ fast friends and she invited me over to her home for paella. I had only had subpar\
  \ paella from restaurants, so I was thrilled to be having paella made by my friend\
  \ in her home. The paella was cooked perfectly with al dente golden rice, fresh\
  \ mussels and large prawns that paired nicely with Tempranillo wine. She also served\
  \ sardines with crispy potato kettle chips. Never had canned fish and bagged potato\
  \ chips tasted so delectable and refined. \n\nMarisol\u2019s family was from a small\
  \ vineyard town called Pedro Munoz. I was fortunate to be invited to this tiny,\
  \ quaint town for Christmas with Marisol and her family. She took me to the famous\
  \ Don Quixote windmills and showed me the vineyards where her family worked for\
  \ many generations. I brought a 5-euro bottle of wine from the grocery store to\
  \ dinner, and her humble family of wine connoisseurs complimented the depth of flavor\
  \ and the oaky and fruitful notes in the wine. Whether they could tell it was a\
  \ cheap wine, I will never know. All I remember from the evening is the laughter,\
  \ the wonderful conversations, the delicious homemade food, and the warm, welcoming\
  \ hearts of these strangers who took this Vietnamese America girl into their home\
  \ and made her feel welcome and loved."
