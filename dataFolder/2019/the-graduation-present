Text: "\u201CI will help you find your mother\u201D, said the vendor from the samosa\
  \ cart.  He looked with such genuine conviction that we knew the course of our journey\
  \ was about to change. \n\nAs a graduation present Nisha Grayson wanted to take\
  \ a trip to India to reconnect to her roots.  She was adopted from Goa at six months\
  \ old and had never been back since.  Three of her friends decided to tag along\
  \ for the vacation.  I suggested looking for Nisha's birth mother, how hard could\
  \ it be?    \n\nWe spent two months in India.  The first month we toured the north\
  \ and hit all the touristy cities: landed in Mumbai, checked out the Taj Mahal in\
  \ Agra, hung out in Delhi, spent Diwali in Jaipur.  When we got to Goa it felt different\
  \ than any other Indian cities.  Goa is a lush green paradise with Portuguese and\
  \ Catholic influence.  The colonial buildings felt like Europe, yet the Hindu shrines\
  \ in the middle of the villages reminded us that we were still in India.  The beaches\
  \ of Goa felt cozy, compared to the California coast that we came from.  Goans referred\
  \ to themselves as Goans and not Indians.  They were different; perhaps the beach\
  \ vibe does that to people. \n\nWe tried to make everyday in Goa efficient.  We\
  \ rented scooters to tackle our tasks. We found the office that issued birth certificates\
  \ and the hospital that Nisha was born in.  We road through narrow roads and dirt\
  \ paths surrounded by rice fields or at least what we thought was rice fields, it\
  \ was probably just a fields of tall grass, but we road, and we road hard!  Our\
  \ down time was spent on the shoreline.  Anjuna Beach has a bustling bargaining\
  \ market to find all sorts of trinkets; Baga Beach was great for nightlife.  All\
  \ the beaches were littered with bamboo beach shacks to relax and order cold Limca\u2019\
  s.  Relaxing, but our mission was to find Nisha\u2019s mom.  \n\nAt the tail end\
  \ of the second month we came to a standstill.  The only clues Nisha had were questionable\
  \ adoption papers and a birthday card.  We came across interesting people that were\
  \ willing to explain Goan history and linage. We figured if we traced back to someone\
  \ with the same family name we might be able to find Nisha\u2019s mom. The search\
  \ was too wide and we were running out of time.  One important priority was to find\
  \ the orphanage.  We were told it was abandoned, but we still wanted to find it.\
  \   \n\nMonday night, on our last week of our trip / mission we stopped for samosas\
  \ at our favorite street vendor.  The modest brown and white cart parked in the\
  \ center of one of the busiest intersections in Panjim, it was this night the vendor,\
  \ Tony, asked, \u201CWhat brings you to Goa?\u201D Nisha told Tony her story while\
  \ his wife and daughter served warm crispy delights to passing patrons.  \u201C\
  I know where that orphanage is.  You meet me her in the morning and I will take\
  \ you.\u201D  Tony looked shifty.  He had a screw for a tooth, cheeks sunken and\
  \ defined.  He was a busy man; played football, ran a food stand, part time postman\
  \ and fisherman.  Tony was popular, he knew everyone in town.  Could he be trusted?\n\
  \nIn the morning we took our chances.  In his blue van he took us to the orphanage.\
  \  The house was behind another house nestled among wide leaf trees and palms. \
  \ We would have never found it on our own.  A family lived in the orphanage and\
  \ Tony convinced them to let us look around.  Nisha has always felt like the first\
  \ six months of her life was a mystery, but this day, a part of that mystery was\
  \ solved. \n\nOn the way back to the hotel, Nisha was beaming.  \u201CI will help\
  \ you find your mother.  I will keep looking.  I will make it my personal mission\
  \ to find her.  I promise.\u201D  Tony was serious.   With our return to the states\
  \ looming we knew our mission was to be put on pause, but our new friend Tony took\
  \ our mission in a new direction."
