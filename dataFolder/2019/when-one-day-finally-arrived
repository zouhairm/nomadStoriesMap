Text: "Traveling was something I always thought of as a dream; not getaways with family\
  \ and friends\u2019 kind of traveling, but the kind to explore a place, to be open\
  \ to the magic that a place has to offer. So while it was by no means the first\
  \ flight I was taking but still, as I got on that airplane to Amsterdam, it felt\
  \ as if it was.\n\nAlthough I had frantically researched every possible site regarding\
  \ public transportation in Amsterdam, and learned how easy it is; as I stepped out\
  \ of the airport towards the bus, I felt a sense of apprehension. This was it -\
  \ I was actually doing it. After getting down at my stop, I didn\u2019t go ten steps\
  \ and I was taken aback by the beauty of a canal. And then it hit me, my strongest\
  \ associations to Amsterdam were probably museumplien, Iamsterdam, tulips or red\
  \ light district and I\u2019m not quite sure what I was expecting, but it was not\
  \ this quaint, perfectly picturesque beauty. This was only the beginning of getting\
  \ my subconscious perceptions challenged.\n\nLater, on my way to Dam Square, I decided\
  \ to get down at the floating market. Walking through the narrow streets lined with\
  \ stores on both sides, I decided to step inside a shop of locally made chocolates\
  \ right across a store full of tulips and souvenirs. This no-frills place made me\
  \ realize what being a kid in a candy store must feel like! Although I had read\
  \ about the market, seen photos of cobblestone streets, it still felt new; it almost\
  \ felt surreal that I was actually here. \n\nContinuing to walk through the streets,\
  \ I was really looking forward to visiting one of the oldest secret churches in\
  \ Amsterdam, Lord in the Attic. During the 17th century, when people were not allowed\
  \ to practice in public, they ended up building secret churches inside their homes\
  \ so they could still practice their faith. This canal house was gorgeous to begin\
  \ with, but the views it must have at a time when there was much more natural beauty\
  \ than today just blew my mind away. Walking through the narrow steps as I went\
  \ across various rooms through the kitchen, and then walking up another spiral narrow\
  \ stairs, crossing a tiny bedroom, I was taken aback by the magnificent church built\
  \ by the owners themselves, no fancy artisans or professional architects. It was\
  \ fascinating to go through that journey through the house; and you appreciate how\
  \ people were passionate about finding a way - an instinct as old as time itself.\n\
  \nOf course it was not an option that I\u2019d visit Amsterdam and not make a trip\
  \ to the Anne Frank House. I had read Anne Frank\u2019s Diary but nothing really\
  \ prepares you to come face to face with the reality of it. The tiny space where\
  \ the family lived, listening to the audio describing how they had to tiptoe all\
  \ day long, but still the sound of determination and hope in those words, I felt\
  \ in every bone why she inspires so many. In the end, after he got to read Anne\u2019\
  s diary, as I watched her father talk about how he felt he missed out on knowing\
  \ his Annie, how incredibly inspiring she was, such a strong person, and that he\
  \ will never get to know her, it\u2019s not something one can shake off. That small\
  \ house, listening to the narration, although I knew the history of it, it still\
  \ felt much more unsettling. And in that moment, after hours of walking around that\
  \ small place, I realized why they say travel changes people.\n\nIn the short time\
  \ of simply opening myself to experiencing and being fully present in each moment\
  \ I had spent, there were so many things that had affected me, and I knew something\
  \ had changed. I saw things differently, felt differently, and had some perceptions\
  \ challenged. I knew that no matter how much you read about a place, until you experience\
  \ it for yourself, it is still an unknown. At this point, the only thing I was certain\
  \ of was that I couldn\u2019t wait to discover things for myself, to take that leap\
  \ again and again."
