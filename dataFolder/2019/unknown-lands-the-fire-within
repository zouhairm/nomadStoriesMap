Text: "Spain. \nIt started out as excitement when I got to know I am traveling for\
  \ work - for an exhibition.\nSo I knew people saw potential in me. \nBut then it\
  \ led to nervousness too.\n\nDay 1\nI killed myself with stilettos on day 1 due\
  \ to low self confidence of being really short and probably goofing up the potential\
  \ clients. \nDay 2. \nI woke up with my feet hurting still not fitting into my stilettos.\
  \ \nEnded up in formal flats with my grey dress, more nervous than the day earlier\
  \ cause I was shorter.  \nBut I managed.\nDay 3. \nBack in my element. \nIn terms\
  \ of my clothes and knowledge. \n\nAnd just like that, the event was over. \nWe\
  \ won an award. \nWe had a massive footfall with the speaker sessions \nIt was a\
  \ different high.\nThat day, during the team dinner and the team day which followed,\
  \ I realised, that I might\u2019ve been new when it came to pharmaceuticals. \n\
  But when it came to my business vertical, there was not a single person who did\
  \ not turn their head in my direction to listen to what I had to say, to know more,\
  \ and how do we plan on curating it further.\n\nTo sum it up?  \nI deserved to be\
  \ there :) \nAnd to reassure me, there was always my bud around. \nA 2 hour walk\
  \ with beautiful Madrid skies and about 2000 things to talk about. \nHe spoke about\
  \ his life and I spoke about mine. \nHe hugged me goodbye at the end of the night.\
  \  \n\nAnd then, after everything, came my ME time. \nI left the Airbnb apartment\
  \ with tears in my eyes; 13-1 Calle de Ventura \n\nThe next 5 days, Madrid & Barcelona,\
  \ they went past in a blur. \n2 cities, 5 days, copious amounts of caffeine, huge\
  \ glasses of sangria, changing landscapes, facades that I live for, cafes that steal\
  \ my heart, people who express love, beaches that freeze you and yet warm your soul,\
  \ hot churros, extremely strange elevators, a number of Polaroids, music on the\
  \ streets and happiness literally everywhere. \nThese 2 cities, so similar and yet\
  \ so different. \nI was warned and asked to be cautious everywhere. \nBy the shopkeepers\
  \ and everyone who knew I was going to Barcelona. \nAnd they might be right in their\
  \ own way, but I felt so much safer in Barcelona that I have felt in a long time\
  \ anywhere, even back home.  \nI felt grown up. \nI lived my way. \nAnd I know that\
  \ a lot of you might think that I do that even back home, yeah, to some extent.\
  \ I do. \nBut I lived for myself when I was away. \nI learned how to eat meals alone\
  \ and it\u2019s actually pretty amazing, it\u2019s peaceful. \nAll I cared about\
  \ was what should I do next which will bring a smile to my face, or leave me speechless\
  \ and breathless and full of life. \nI missed a lot of people when I was away but\
  \ not in a way to get back to meet them, but in a way that I wanted them to be around\
  \ cause I know they\u2019re just as crazy. \nEvery single day, in a different country,\
  \ I realised how trapped I feel back home, how held back I am, how it\u2019s filled\
  \ with a lot of baggage and how I\u2019d do anything to trade my current life to\
  \ a new place. \n\nAs I left room number 13 from my Barcelona hostel (yes, now I\
  \ have a special connection with the number 13) on 18th October to go back home,\
  \ I literally felt like crap. \nI didn\u2019t want to come back home. \n\nA 13.5\
  \ hour flight, flying across different time zones, clicking pictures of the golden\
  \ skies, least bit excited of setting my feet in Bombay, which is never the case!\
  \ \nBut I\u2019m back.  \nIt\u2019s inevitable. \n\nI couldn\u2019t be more glad\
  \ of choosing to stay back even though it hurts to be back. \nAnd I know that this\
  \ might just be the beginning. \n\nTo everyone who has endured my sadness about\
  \ being back? My apologies. But it\u2019s going to stay for a while. \nSpain was\
  \ a lot more personal than professional."
