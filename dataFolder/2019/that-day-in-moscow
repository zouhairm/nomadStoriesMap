Text: "The rapid pace of the great avenues of Moscow and the intense cold that is\
  \ felt at the tips of your fingers when you walk through the streets dodging the\
  \ snow, is not perceived from the windows of the warm lounge of the Ziferblat, a\
  \ famous anti-coffee in the downtown of the capital, inside the taste of a good\
  \ breakfast and the people who intermittently inhabit it give the feeling that you\
  \ start the day in the middle of a classic home, between windows, kitchen, bathtubs,\
  \ beds still unsettled and old cabinets with half-folded clothes, you find an atypical\
  \ stop, but necessary for any curious tourist, it is a place to rest away from traditional\
  \ taverns, modern bars and recommended places.\n\nThe anti-cafes have begun to change\
  \ the concept of space and time of the Russian metropolis, a city of gray skies\
  \ where the sun rarely makes a stop at noon, but that vibrates with its Orthodox\
  \ cathedrals full of colors and a subway underground whose enormous electric stairs\
  \ show you each section with the multiculturalism of the East, faces, and voices\
  \ in which you can not distinguish the strong accents, but communicate clearly through\
  \ blue glances, each station seems the entrance to solemn dance halls . \n\nIn the\
  \ center, as if you were walking through a gallery, you will come across works of\
  \ art on both sides of Tverskaya Street, its fame as the meeting place of the great\
  \ brands and boutiques of Moscow, is reaffirmed by just observing the exquisite\
  \ coats they stroll down its street in the skin of elegant ladies and gentlemen\
  \ abstracted by the perfectly decorated cabinets.\n\nA few meters away, you find\
  \ the Red Square with its imposing architectural figures, Saint Basil's Cathedral,\
  \ Kazan Cathedral, and the Kremlin, it does not matter if you look at them superficially,\
  \ no one is undaunted by the beauty and meaning of their symbolism, the same as\
  \ every day remember hundreds of onlookers as they approach the mausoleum of Lenin,\
  \ dressed indiscreetly by the sticks of selfies.\n\nThey say that the cold is hungry\
  \ and in Moscow they have learned that lesson very well, for those who are lovers\
  \ of exploring culture with their palate, there are restaurants of all types and\
  \ prices, Shashlyk, Borsch, and Pelmeni, are the names of some of the dishes most\
  \ known, all common in local menus, sometimes served perfectly with champagne and\
  \ caviar and other times with plenty of sorghum and a shot of vodka, to the health\
  \ of the body, the Russians say laughingly.\n\nBy nightfall, the lights of the bars\
  \ begin to illuminate the dreary low areas of the buildings that suddenly become\
  \ locals with extensive showcases of drinks and multiple types of vodkas, even for\
  \ an expert sybarite would be hard to imagine, here begins the nightlife of the\
  \ capital, a world open to sex, lust and drugs, but also to music, love and loneliness.\n\
  \nMoscow is what is said of it and what is thought, but above all what it feels,\
  \ is the city of modern buildings and buildings in ruins, giant avenues and small\
  \ courtyards, poverty and wealth, luxuries, pleasure, and illusion."
