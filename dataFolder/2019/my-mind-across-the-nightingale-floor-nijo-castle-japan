Text: "My Mind Across The Nightingale Floor: Nijo Castle, Japan\n\nHave you ever read\
  \ a novel that moves your imagination? Let you dream of walking on it. Give you\
  \ more curiosity in every page of it. Makes you wonder: where did the writer get\
  \ the inspiration of the story? What kind of situation that inspire him/her to write\
  \ the story? Did the place really exist? The questions keep on popping up in your\
  \ mind as reading the story.\nAs for me, it happened years ago when I read the novel\
  \ that is beautifully written by Lian Hearn titled Across the Nightingale Floor.\
  \ It was a fantasy novel, set back in feudal system period in Japan. The story was\
  \ about the journey of a young man within the conflict between the Otori Clan and\
  \ the Tohan clan. The story has a different kind of great location as the background.\
  \ The location that moves me a lot was a castle with the nightingale floor on it.\n\
  \nThe nightingale floor (Uguisubari) is a kind of floor that makes a chirping sound\
  \ (bird sound) when walked upon. From the story, it was used as security device\
  \ to detect the person who are sneaking through the corridors. The floors were made\
  \ from dried boards whereas nails were used to make a chirping noise under pressure.\n\
  \nThis concept of traditionally securing system was interested me, a lot. It keeps\
  \ me wondering on how much the ancient people comprehend about securing method.\
  \ And how they made the securing tools from limited sources at that time. For defending\
  \ themselves. It gave me this amaze and curious feeling. And makes me wonder: is\
  \ it really exist?\n\nThis feeling moved my subconscious mind. I found myself try\
  \ to find a possible way to travel to Japan. I was a college student in Indonesia\
  \ back then. So one of the possible way to travel abroad was by joining the student\
  \ exchange program. In 2009, I got the opportunity to live in Japan through the\
  \ student exchange program, called University of the Ryukyus Student Exchange Program\
  \ (URSEP) for 1 year in Okinawa Japan. Thus I made it to Japan, living my colorful\
  \ life. \n\nThe curiosity vibe was still going strong in my mind. It was on November\
  \ 2009 when I (suddenly) got the chance to go to Kyoto through the campus trip.\
  \ We visited many castles in Kyoto, when all the scenery was red-warm-colored by\
  \ the autumn maple leaves (Momiji). I remember it was raining a whole day. It was\
  \ cold and wet. And I found no nightingale floor. At that time, I wondered whether\
  \ my imagination was too high to find that thing. \nUntil I visited Nijo Castle,\
  \ that also located in Kyoto Prefecture. The castle was built in 1603 as the residence\
  \ of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the first shogun of the Edo Period. The castle consists of\
  \ The Ninomaru Palace, the ruin of The Honmaru Palace, other buildings, and beautiful\
  \ gardens. \n\nThe main building of the castle is called The Ninomaru Palace. It\
  \ was a white-brown-one-story elegant building, constructed by woods with tatami\
  \ mat covered room. The ceiling was elegantly decorated. And you could still smell\
  \ the woody aroma around the palace. Somehow, that gave me the ancient feeling.\n\
  \nThe first time when I walked upon The Ninomaru Palace, the floor was chirping.\
  \ The woods from the floor was producing the sound of bird. Nightingale bird: Uguisu.\
  \ I remember that I got a goose bumps during walked upon it. I felt so amazed. This\
  \ was it. The one that keeps me imagining, wondering. I found it. It is really exist.\
  \ As I walked upon the floors and listening to the chirping sound, I was visualizing\
  \ period people walked upon it. Their traditional clothes that rub against the floor;\
  \ their fast steps, then became slower when hearing the sound. It felt so magical\
  \ imagining it.\n\nPerhaps, it was just a basic floor for someone else. Or maybe,\
  \ it was just a wooden ancient construction for the other. But for me, it became\
  \ one of my reason for being there years ago. And it keeps me inspired, to go somewhere\
  \ else in this world, further. To find another magical thing."
