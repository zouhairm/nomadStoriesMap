Text: "Macau Fisherman\u2019s Wharf\n\nTo the south of the island of Macau and around\
  \ Monte Hill, there is a piece of coastal land reclaimed from the sea. Since 1923,\
  \ reclaiming project has been conducted in two stages to add more land to the small\
  \ city in name of New Port. The area used to be for agriculture purpose, belonging\
  \ to Cathedral District of Macau. With more tall buildings built in the area in\
  \ later period, a number of new roads have been paved and named differently in Chinese\
  \ city name such as Beijing and Shanghai in the old district and world famous cities\
  \ like Rome, Berlin and Madrid in the new district of the area with its Friendship\
  \ Avenue as the dividend.\n\nAfter five years of construction, Macau Fisherman\u2019\
  s Wharf came into soft opening on the last day of 2005 and into full operation one\
  \ year later. The facilities on the wharf such as casinos, museums, culture center\
  \ and Buddhist temple have been opened to the public around the clock since then\
  \ with no admission fee charged. The entertainment theme park is decided into sections:\
  \ Tang City, East Meets West and Legend Wharf. Tang City is a shopping centre while\
  \ East Meets West a theme park with volcano settings, castles and ancient Roman\
  \ square. Standing on the volcano setting gives visitor a nice view of the whole\
  \ wharf. Legend Wharf is filled with shops, pubs, hotels, Karaoke and other leisure\
  \ and entertainment facilities, widely welcomed by visitors from all over the world.\n\
  \nLast year I spent the Spring Festival in Macau. One afternoon, I went to the Fisherman\u2019\
  s Wharf full of festival celebrations with many temporary stands set up by students\
  \ selling their self-made gadgets on streets. The crowd of visitors and stands presented\
  \ an atmosphere of happiness in the festival. The area was almost wrapped in red,\
  \ the favourite colour of Chinese for festivals, and golden decorations adding more\
  \ charm to the area. I felt totally relaxed by taking on a cruising wagon or having\
  \ some chats with friendly strangers now and then.\n\nI prefer to visit the wharf\
  \ in daytime as I could have a better view of it. I would walk by those piers docked\
  \ with yachts on brownish wooden pavements flanked with creamy white columns to\
  \ the far. Every time I took ferry from Hong Kong, the first scene to me would be\
  \ the forest-like columns painted in white and black belts. In the humid environment\
  \ by the sea, the wharf is left with green dyed by tides. I don\u2019t know the\
  \ green are colour of sea lives. I would think they are colour of lives giving more\
  \ vitality to the wharf.\n\nThere is a pavilion in front of Rocks Hotel, with occasional\
  \ concerts held in it. Once I saw a band of pretty girls playing various music instruments\
  \ in the pavilion. Attracted by those performers, crowd of viewers blocked my way\
  \ and had me stopped to have a look at them. Soon enough, I found something new\
  \ and more interesting and quickened my pace to my next stop despite of the roaring\
  \ music from those speakers in the square.\n\nLike other women, I find more fun\
  \ in shopping. The commodity price in Macau is not as high as that in Hong Kong\
  \ but with the same availability for all the top brands of the world. There is a\
  \ long corridor on the wharf with many discounted stores for luxurious goods. There\
  \ are also plenty of souvenir shops on the wharf, selling at highly different prices\
  \ for customers\u2019s choice. Once I made a special visiting to the wharf for a\
  \ kind of doll I liked very much on my back trip from China Mainland to Hong Kong.\n\
  \nThe last time I visited the wharf was in a terrible weather caused by typhoon.\
  \ In contrary to high prosperity in the ordinary days, the wharf was with few visitors\
  \ and most of commercial facilities were out of business. Walking in the tranquility,\
  \ I thought I was doing some exploration to a mysterious castle."
