Text: "\u2018Embrace\u2019. That was the first word that came to mind as I looked\
  \ at the water of river Jhelum colliding against the rocks that lay underneath it.\
  \ The powerful wind that blew across the valleys of Swat, Pakistan, whispered in\
  \ my ears a story unfamiliar to me. I was a city girl, I was not accustomed to the\
  \ fresh air of the country side. Having gone through some tragedies in my life I\
  \ had decided to have a change of scenery, and as fate would have it some students\
  \ of my university decided to go to Swat, so I decided to tag along without caring\
  \ about the dangers of land sliding, steep incomplete roads, unknown stops in unknown\
  \ places. It took us 12 hours from Islamabad to reach Swat, stopping only once in\
  \ Peshawar in order to have our dinner. Even though I went with my classmates, I\
  \ felt isolated. They prioritized their photography and dancing to the music and\
  \ mingling with one another, but I wanted to listen. Listen to the tale mother nature\
  \ had never had the chance of telling me. \nWe reached Kalam, Swat at midnight.\
  \ It was too dark to see anything as I stepped out of the bus, my legs wobbly from\
  \ the long travel. It was cold there, as it was in the Northern Areas of Pakistan,\
  \ it had been inhabited with Taliban so nobody was allowed to go there, but due\
  \ to the successful operations by the army, the area had been cleared from any sort\
  \ of threat, so I figured it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity as my parents\
  \ would have been too afraid to ever go there. As I gazed upon the sky, I was left\
  \ in awe. The darkness was embedded with stars as though they were jewels in the\
  \ sky. I felt my heart tremble, it was a feeling of awe mixed in with sadness. I\
  \ had never known the sky could look like that. In a world of eerie silence the\
  \ stars provided hope. I walked to my room while looking up in the sky, I could\
  \ not take my eyes off it, the people behind me laughed when they saw me like that,\
  \ but it still couldn\u2019t stop me from keeping my head up.\nI fell asleep almost\
  \ immediately as I was exhausted. I was woken up by the gasping sounds of my roommates\
  \ as they peeked outside the window. I changed my clothes, which was hard as the\
  \ temperature was below 11 degrees Celsius and my body felt frozen and cold. But\
  \ I still managed and rushed outside. And that is when I heard her speak in all\
  \ her beauty, making the leaves dance in the breeze, making the water rise and lower\
  \ itself as they embraced the rocks underneath. The sun still hadn\u2019t risen\
  \ but there was enough light to see everything clearly. Some people though of the\
  \ scenery as dry, but for me it was as though the darkness of the previous night\
  \ had suddenly lifted its curtains and presented the underlying beauty that it hid\
  \ from man. I grabbed a cup of tea and sat just besides the water, the warm steam\
  \ coming from the tea cup tickled my red nose. I had never seen the lush greenery\
  \ up close. It felt peaceful. Like the world wasn\u2019t ending, nobody was panicking,\
  \ you weren\u2019t getting scolded for every little thing, people weren\u2019t fighting,\
  \ there wasn\u2019t any traffic, and there was only peace. Suddenly tears trickled\
  \ slowly from the side of my eyes as I gazed lovingly at nature\u2019s beauty and\
  \ nature gazing back at me showing off the beauty God had painted it with. The mountains\
  \ surrounding the valley of Swat were covered with snow, while the valley itself\
  \ didn\u2019t have a speck of it. It was as though the mountains protected the valley\
  \ from the coldness of the world outside. Even though it was cold outside, my heart\
  \ became very warm and comfortable. I finally smiled ever so lightly."
