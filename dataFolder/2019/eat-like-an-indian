Text: "I started to feel like a stranger in my own skin. India no longer felt like\
  \ home, despite being half Indian. This is a country where so many are starved not\
  \ only of food, but of freedom from religious and caste-determined realities. Here,\
  \ discrimination devours destinies. Unfortunately, these ideologies still rattle\
  \ through the bones of even the most educated. Recently, the scars of the ongoing\
  \ Indo-Pakistani religious conflict deepened, when the lives of 40 Indian soldiers\
  \ were lost to a suicide bombing in Kashmir. This exacerbated the illusion of the\
  \ \u201Cother\u201D. These were once our brothers and sisters.\n\nI have witnessed\
  \ in the people however, a hunger to belong, to be united and to be cleansed from\
  \ the echoes of Partition and injustice through the sacred and communal ritual of\
  \ eating. It is in these moments we transcend our differences, even if it\u2019\
  s only for one meal. And thus my journey to find unity within myself and a divided\
  \ country began.\n\nIt started in the North, where I softened at the clanking of\
  \ a metal plate when Aarthi placed it on the gritty, cold ground where I sat. On\
  \ it was arranged a quarter corn on a cob with a meagre helping of rice and dahl.\
  \ My plate, like their house, reflected the same bareness of the slate-covered,\
  \ hilltop terrain of Mukteshwar. Their home was held within four crumbling mud walls\
  \ and a few sparsely positioned belongings, yet somehow it emanated a warmth that\
  \ starkly contrasted the frigid Himalayan air. To others, I was merely a wandering\
  \ alien taken in by the kindness of their spirit. But to them, I was immediately\
  \ family. Even amidst their seemingly empty house they wore smiles that could carry\
  \ the weight of the world, their offerings like gold. They possessed something far\
  \ greater than any \u201Cthing\u201D. And my heart softened.\n\nThen I found myself\
  \ in the South, venturing the noisy streets of Thiruvanandapuram, blistering in\
  \ the heat. I retreated under the tin roof of a dilapidated chai vala, snacking\
  \ on vada, shaded from the relentless, humid South Indian summers. \n\u201CMore?\u201D\
  \ Delighted by my gluttonous tendencies, the shopkeeper placed another into my hands,\
  \ paired with the widest of grins. I couldn\u2019t help myself. I scoffed it down.\n\
  \u201CFree\u201D he bobbled his head, refusing to let me pay. My furrowed, sweaty\
  \ brows instantaneously relaxed. Home.\n\nIn the hills of Kumily I spent days in\
  \ a wander, feasting on thalis in roadside valas, shoulder to shoulder with rickshaw\
  \ drivers and shop owners alike. Although we had lived worlds apart, somehow I saw\
  \ myself in them. Our sameness was made ever apparent by our identical meals, proudly\
  \ wearing the same sambar, yoghurt and rice coated fingers under one roof. \n\n\
  In Varkala, as the circle that we had formed on the deep red Keralan soils grew,\
  \ so did our laughter. I found myself absorbed in chatter of broken English and\
  \ Malayalam. Brothers (chettan-maar), mothers (ammas) and sisters (chechis) huddled\
  \ together, peeling, chopping, frying and sharing stories under a singular incandescent\
  \ bulb. By the evening hour, as the distinct aroma of masala whisked through the\
  \ air, I became ever aware that the communion occurred much before the meal; with\
  \ bellies full of laughter. \n\nIn a Trivandrum ashram, we chanted every evening\
  \ at 8 o\u2019clock, seated knee to knee on fraying mats as our voices echoed through\
  \ the dining hall. \L\u201CBrahm\u0101rpa\xF1am Brahma Havir\u2026\u201D The symphonious\
  \ delivery of our gratitude dissolved into stillness as we ate our sattvic meals\
  \ in complete silence. These were offerings to the gods, the ones we sought within\
  \ ourselves and I would only hope, the ones we sought within each other.\n\nAnd\
  \ so it happened slowly. Steadily over the months I found her again, Mother India.\
  \ She lives in the often overlooked details. She can be found under the rusting\
  \ roof of a chai vala, or when eating off a banana leaf, or simply in silent glances.\
  \ North, South, East or West, these acts of communion have revealed to me the greatest\
  \ and purest Indian qualities that rest inherently within every spirit, and I hope\
  \ that one day these will be the ones that define our futures and ourselves."
