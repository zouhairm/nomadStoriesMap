Text: 'When I was younger, I would only travel to Venezuela because that was where
  my mom is from. I''ve always wanted to see other place and explore the other side
  of the world. During my second year of college, I had an opportunity to take a History
  and Philosophy of Science class that included a trip to the UK in the summer. This
  was going to be traveling alone without a parent. I was a little hesitant because
  I''m sheltered. I applied anyways and got in to the program with my friend. The
  idea of going to a different place without family was still scary to me, but I still
  went. It was very comfortable being there with the school and my friend and I was
  ok. However, for our free day my friend wanted to take the train to Dover to hike
  up the infamous White Cliffs. I wasn''t big on nature and didn''t like the idea
  of separating from my class. But then I realized that I needed to get out of my
  bubble and explore. As my school''s motto likes to put it: Take on your world. And
  that''s what I did. We went and hiked and saw the coast of France from England.
  What were the chances of me ever going to experience that if I didn''t go. Dover
  was not a tourist destination but I loved how it was a quaint town that I got to
  know and spend time in. I got to eat more authentic English food, and experience
  a small town, and got great views of nature. Imagine what I would have missed out
  if I didn''t take a leap into the unknown.'
