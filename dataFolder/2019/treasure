Text: "We were a group of ten or eleven. Two were my flatmates, Sasha and Jos\xE9\
  , and the others classmates of Sasha\u2019s. For her birthday, we were invited to\
  \ her hometown Dlh\xE1 nad Oravou in northern Slovakia. We were thrilled to be going;\
  \ through a shaky all-night bus ride, a hungry layover in Krak\xF3w, a red-eye,\
  \ and a midnight rattle along an unsealed mountain road in a van with the passenger\
  \ door taped shut \u2013 \u201Cfor safety\u201D. Arriving at the town\u2019s only\
  \ hotel with the town\u2019s only bar, Sasha\u2019s uncles greeted us with mandatory\
  \ homebrewed slivovica which we all tossed back, just thrilled to be there. \n\n\
  The next day was the kind that smelled of good weather. It was late autumn. The\
  \ sunlight was gentle but bright and washed the surrounding hills in gold. Sasha\
  \ lead a hike that dipped into valley forests and rose onto grassy hilltops. We\
  \ glimpsed towns below clustered on the banks of the Orava, its bends glinting and\
  \ shimmering. Clouds cast dark patches that migrated together across the landscape,\
  \ and a chill when they passed overhead.\n\nAt some point, we found an apple tree.\
  \ It was growing sideways, its branches pushing over a rotted fence. The apples\
  \ were small and sour so we left them, uneaten, scattered at the base of the tree.\
  \ As we scrambled up the next hill, I turned back to see wild boars scrounging through\
  \ the remains.  \n\nIn the afternoon, the hike dispersed into small groups so each\
  \ new wonder was discovered in cascading rounds of delight \u2013 Did you see the\u2026\
  ? How great was the\u2026?\n\nThe final wonder was a crumbling church. Someone noticed\
  \ the long shadows, that the wind had picked up, and suggested we turn back. The\
  \ stone spire, still mostly intact, reached at least twenty metres into the air.\
  \ The roof was gone but the walls were still standing well enough that the more\
  \ adventurous of us could climb up to sit on long, cracked window ledges. \n\nAt\
  \ the base of a wall, Jos\xE9 turned his phone flashlight on to investigate a hole\
  \ in the ground just wide enough for adult shoulders. I had my own look and saw\
  \ nothing. The hole absorbed all light hungrily and completely, but returned a faint\
  \ echo. Jos\xE9 shot a grin at me, whispered \"treasure\" and I felt I had no choice.\
  \ A few of Sasha\u2019s classmates were concerned but their curiosity rang louder.\
  \ They lowered Jos\xE9 down, legs first, holding a torch. I followed, deeply apprehensive,\
  \ and the dark was immediately oppressive. \n\nJos\xE9 was swinging the torch around\
  \ slowly, making weak arcs of light. I couldn\u2019t speak. The air was stagnant,\
  \ and bitter with age. It appeared to be a room no larger than a garage, though\
  \ the ceiling was too low for Jos\xE9 to stand upright. The beam of light from his\
  \ torch settled low. \n\nI sensed Jos\xE9 stumble a few steps backwards. The torchlight\
  \ curved away wildly, then back. At first I couldn\u2019t see more than irregular\
  \ rocks piled knee-high up against the wall. But then I couldn\u2019t breathe because\
  \ they weren\u2019t rocks.\n\nAfter surfacing, I still couldn\u2019t speak. I felt\
  \ whatever hung in the air below had seeped into me and I was reluctant to let it\
  \ out above ground in case it spread. Jos\xE9, also silent, handed off the digital\
  \ camera we\u2019d taken with us and walked away. The others peered down at the\
  \ tiny camera screen, agape. They counted out loud fifteen \u2013 \u201Cno, the\
  \ picture\u2019s cut off here so it\u2019s probably closer to twenty\u201D \u2013\
  \ human skulls. \n\nWhile we walked back along old train tracks, the others speculated:\
  \ \"a rushed grave\" \u2013 \"World War II victims\" \u2013 \"no, the church was\
  \ more fourteenth century than twentieth\" \u2013 \"well, no one said they came\
  \ together\". Sasha had only disinterested suggestions \u2013 \"it could be anything,\
  \ maybe bandits, this was Slovak country after all\". I lagged behind the group\
  \ with Jos\xE9. Once, he pointed out the moon rising between hills, an uneven yellow,\
  \ but otherwise we were silent."
