Text: "My Chicago experiences have always been fulfilling.  Although, I would love\
  \ to travel abroad, I don't have to go across the world to meet people of other\
  \ countries or try exotic ethnic foods.  My golden gem to explore and to get to\
  \ know people is right here in my local area.  Taking the time to travel downtown\
  \ allows me to try something new.  I always had the desire to learn how to rock\
  \ climb so I took advantage of a rock climbing experience through Airbnb where a\
  \ local host met me at Brooklyn Boulders - a hip indoor rock climbing gym that is\
  \ located in the West loop of Chicago not far from downtown.   Brooklyn Boulders\
  \ fosters a community of climbers and gives connection through rock climbing events\
  \ and classes, fitness, art, music and culture events.  It is truly a place where\
  \ you can meet people from various walks of life.  I met my future rock climbing\
  \ buddy here who migrated from China and has been a Chicagoan for three years. \
  \ Having a friend from a different culture means a lot as she can introduce me to\
  \ her traditions and of course traditional Chinese food.   I experience my first\
  \ homemade hot pot right here in Chicago. \nAfter getting a full body workout from\
  \ climbing, I decided to go to Michigan Avenue.  Beautiful and eye catching, this\
  \ avenue is known for its skyscrapers and retail stores along with daytime and night\
  \ entertainment from the locals near the Chicago Riverwalk - located on the south\
  \ bank of the main branch of the Chicago River downtown.   What makes entertainment\
  \ fun here? The performers always include the locals and the tourists.  People start\
  \ singing or the performer might ask someone to participate.   From a group of Latin\
  \ musicians playing music for locals to do salsa dancing, a Irish men playing the\
  \ bagpipes to a cool interactive human jumping competition hosted by a local group\
  \ of talented African men, you can get all types of unique cultural events right\
  \ on Michigan Ave.   After watching a street performance, I headed over to the Cheesecake\
  \ Factory to purchase one of their well-known rich slices of chocolate cheesecake.\
  \  Each slice is about 8 to 9 dollars a piece. Across the street is the Water Tower\
  \ Building.  Inside the Water Tower are beautiful water fountains slanted between\
  \ the two escalators.  Pearls of water jump out of the fountain like dolphins jumping\
  \ out of water.  What makes this building such as tourists and local attraction\
  \ is its unique architecture.  Each floor has its own set of stores and restaurants.\
  \  On Saturdays, it can get a bit crowded.  \nBefore going on the Metra to head\
  \ back home,  my last stop was the Millennium Park located on Randolph Street. \
  \ The Millennium Park is known for its artistic designs, landscape and music concerts.\
  \  Many well-known performers have entertained many Chicago visitors at the Jay\
  \ Pritzker Pavilion which was created by architect Frank Gehry.   Jaume Plensa's\
  \ Crown Fountain, an interactive artwork and video sculpture, is also a well-known\
  \ feature in Chicago's Millennium Park.   The things to do downtown Chicago is endless\
  \ and getting a real cultural experience will never end."
