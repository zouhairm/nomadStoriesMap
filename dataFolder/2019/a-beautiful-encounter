Text: "Across the breakfast table sat a near-stranger and I was surprised at the ease\
  \ of our conversation. C was a white from South Africa, while I was a Chinese from\
  \ Singapore. Many Caucasians found Singapore efficient but lifeless, and in their\
  \ words, \u201Coverly perfect\u201D, but C had unreservedly proclaimed that he liked\
  \ Singapore. I was typically reserved around Caucasians \u2013 it was like a natural\
  \ barrier existed \u2013 but with C, curiosity fueled our conversation. \nIt was\
  \ my solo trip to Hong Kong, and I had run into some trouble the night before. \n\
  \n\u201CI am the Hong Kong Police and I demand discipline from you,\u201D my room-mate\
  \ in the hostel had said tauntingly, after yelling at me in Cantonese that she wanted\
  \ to freeze me to death. I had left the room to seek help, and C had reached out\
  \ and asked, \u201CAre you okay and do you need help?\u201D   \nPost-breakfast,\
  \ we decided to explore Macau together, where my Macau friend would be our guide.\
  \ It was a leisurely afternoon. We had no particular agenda, which left us free\
  \ to roam the cobbled and quiet streets of Coloane. We checked out random alleys\
  \ and shops, took snaps of quirky architecture, and scaled the steep steps of the\
  \ Coloane trail. We basked in the cool weather, laughed a lot, and I felt light,\
  \ young and free. \n\nThe afternoon flew by, and it was time to take the ferry back.\
  \ In our ride back, I told C what I thought of him: a good-natured lad who had a\
  \ sense of justice.  \n\n\u201CSo, how would your friends describe you?\u201D I\
  \ asked. \n\n\u201CThey would describe me as a dick because I would never hesitate\
  \ to laugh at them,\u201D He laughed. \n\u201CThough they\u2019d always know that\
  \ they can count on me to help them, if they need my help.\u201D\n\nWe were on a\
  \ travelator. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019d you do if you drop your phone on the ground\
  \ now?\u201D he asked. \n\n\u201CCurse? Then exit the travelator and run back to\
  \ retrieve it?\u201D I answered. \n\n\u201CWould you laugh?\u201D He asked, a smile\
  \ playing at his lips. \n\n\u201CI might. Do you laugh at everything?\u201D \n\n\
  \u201CIt\u2019s how I was brought up, I suppose. My first response to a lot of things,\
  \ even the bad ones is to laugh at it.\u201D \n\n\u201CLike Claire from Modern family?\
  \ Where she processes grief with a dark joker-like smile and it\u2019s something\
  \ she can\u2019t help. \"\n\nAs it turned out, Claire was indeed the character he\
  \ related most with, on Modern family. We stopped at a convenience store to get\
  \ drinks. \n\n\u201CAre you hungry?\u201D I asked. \n\n\u201CWell, I could eat.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201COh, I am never going to get a straight answer from you, am I?\u201D\
  \ \n\nWe burst out laughing because the same exchange must have transpired like\
  \ at least five times that day.\n\nAs night drew, we continued to tease and quibble\
  \ as we made our way back to the hostel. At the doorstep of our hostel, I knew it\
  \ was probably our last moment together because I was catching an early flight out\
  \ the next morning. \u201CContinue being a dick okay!\u201D I said, before we locked\
  \ in a tight farewell embrace. \n\nThe encounter with C was beautiful and timely.\
  \  In the past years, my luck in dating had been dismal.  On dates, I was either\
  \ guarded and hence awkward, or I left no stone unturned and became quick to please.\
  \ I was neither able to enjoy the process of knowing or meeting someone nor get\
  \ the outcome I had desired. Over time, I had grown dispirited and doubtful. The\
  \ encounter had defied my past experiences. With the right fit, I could be at ease,\
  \ and enjoy the company of an attractive man. \n\n\u201CAnyone can be unkind to\
  \ you, but you will always have to be kind to yourself.\u201D I had thrown out this\
  \ random remark, while we were on the ferry, navigating on choppy waters back to\
  \ Hong Kong. He nodded. \n\nIt was a timely encounter \u2013 I found the universe\u2019\
  s resounding reminder to believe in possibilities again. We just have to be brave,\
  \ have hope, and keep looking. \n\n(682 words)"
