Text: "Once upon a time,before I came to live in Buenos Aires I was a tourist walking\
  \ in Floridas street with a Mexican friend when a girl toke me in my hand and inveted\
  \ me to drink a drink.\nI got in with her and they put me in a sof\xE1 with 2 girls\
  \ and then they started to pass four  hands in my body. \nFew minutes after another\
  \ girl brought my drink,but in same time I tought it was a medicament that will\
  \ make me sleep and those girls will robe me.\nIn same time I said.\nThank you girls,I\
  \ am al\xE9rgic to alcohool.\nAnd the girls tould me. \nAH...are you allergic to\
  \ Cuba Libre?\nSo  nos just to got in here you will need to pay 300 d\xF3lares.\n\
  I Said. \nI wont pay anithyng because you tould me that it will be free entry and\
  \ a drink as well. \nI started to call the Police,but using the number of Brazil\
  \ (190).I was a brazilian tourist in Buenos Aires.\nBut in Argentina the emergency\
  \ number is 911 like in Usa.\nI tought as well.\n-I Will call the Police,and they\
  \ will think I got in,I had sex with the girls and I didnt want to pay for theyr\
  \ services.\nThats why I resolved to get out there running a lot until my hostel.\n\
  I was extremally shoked with the situation,because in my wallet I had a lot of dollars\
  \ and Brazilian money too. \nAfter that situation I went to live in Ireland and\
  \ now I am living in Argentina. \nAll my family and friends knew about that history\
  \ and when I go to parties and some family/friend meetings,they always remember\
  \ and smile recordind everthing that I told them.\nNowadays living in Argentina\
  \ I nevermore got in a strange house."
