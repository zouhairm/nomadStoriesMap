Text: "A 35-year-old Vanita Thackeray, a villager from Khambacha pada (hamlet) will\
  \ be standing in a queue for water after four days. Reason? Even if the civic body\
  \ provides water every day for half an hour, the families in the hamlet get a chance\
  \ once in four days to fill-up water for themselves.   \n\nDozens of water bottles,\
  \ around 20 utensils and plastic cans filled with water can be seen outside every\
  \ mud houses in the Khambacha pada. The villagers which belong to an adivasi (tribal)\
  \ community have to use water depending upon the quantity of water filled after\
  \ every four days.\n \nOut of the 27 hamlets in Aarey Milk Colony, hamlets such\
  \ as - chafachapada, Khambachapada, Keltipada, navsachapada suffers water scarcity\
  \ every day. All the 27 hamlets have various issues to survive their daily life.\
  \ The issues mainly include - water scarcity, leopard attacks, lack of street lights,\
  \ bad roads, less income source.\n\nThe barter system is one such technique used\
  \ by the villagers even today. Prakash Bhoir, a villager from Kelti pada, said,\
  \ \u201CWhile every family gets chance once in every four days, the families also\
  \ use the barter system to get extra water. If I request my neighbor to give me\
  \ one bucket of water from the water they have filled for themselves, they will\
  \ note it down in a notebook. And next time when my family fills water for ourselves,\
  \ I have to give a bucket of water in return to them.\u201D\n\n\nOccupation for\
  \ livelihood\n\nFor villagers, the land is an important part of their source of\
  \ income. Majority of the villagers depend upon farming as an occupation. In every\
  \ hamlet's variety of grains fruits and vegetables are cultivated by the villagers\
  \ in their agricultural forestland for their living. \n\nIn some hamlets, the farm\
  \ fresh vegetables are sold on the spot. \u201CIn the evening, many visitors visit\
  \ our farm to buy fresh vegetables. Our major source of income is earned by farming.\
  \ Varieties of vegetables and seasonal fruits are sold by us throughout the year.\
  \ I have already got orders for mangoes,\u201D added Bhoir.\n\nBut now they fear\
  \ to lose their land for development projects. The Aarey colony is spread over 3,000\
  \ acres of land and with 27 hamlets, they have a size of around 7,000 population.\
  \ The development project started with giving land to Film City a few decades ago\
  \ and now slowly other projects such as metro, Force One, planning of zoo to name\
  \ a few.\n\nBhoir, added, \u201COnly tribal Adivasi were residents of Aarey earlier.\
  \ But due to development projects, more and more people started residing. The land\
  \ was earlier given for dairy development but slowly, more and more projects started\
  \ coming in. Most of the tribals fear losing their land for development projects.\
  \ Even if we are rehabilitated for the development projects, we will lose our main\
  \ source of income. Where will we do agriculture after getting rehabilitated in\
  \ SRA buildings? In 2014 development plan (DP) of the civic body, the padas were\
  \ the inhabitant stayed were not at all demarked. We had to raise our voice to make\
  \ sure that all 27 hamlets get demarcation in the DP.\u201D\n\nChanges in tradition\
  \ and culture\n\nJust like agriculture, sometimes their source of income also depends\
  \ on their traditional artwork. The mud houses can be seen decorated with warli\
  \ painting. Various communities in Adivasi staying in Aarey includes - Warli, Malhar\
  \ Koli, Konkona and katkari to name a few.\n\nThe community\u2019s traditional tarpa\
  \ dance too lost its traditional shine. The tarpa dance is performed by the Adivasis\
  \ during the festival seasons by coming together. The traditional folk dance of\
  \ the Adivasis is under threat as the younger generation don't seem too interested\
  \ in it.\n\nMarriages are done in inter-hamlets so that the inhabitant stays inside\
  \ the hamlet rather than outsider settling here and becoming the resident. \u201C\
  We are not well connected with the outside people. Our parents preferred searching\
  \ our life-partners from within 27 hamlets in Aarey Colony,\u201D said Thackeray."
