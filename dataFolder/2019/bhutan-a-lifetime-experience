Text: "It was the Land of Happiest people indeed. When I chose Bhutan for my first\
  \ solo trip I was nervous and frightened because it included one of the difficult\
  \ treks from my bucket list  - \u201CTrek to Tiger Monastery\u201D. It was going\
  \ to be the most chilling trip for me as the temperatures were between -1 to -14\
  \ degree centigrade. Just the thought of it made me shiver as I have always been\
  \ surviving in 30 degrees.I travelled alone on an airplane for the very first time\
  \ which was amazing. As I went to Bhutan it had a different culture and vibe altogether.\
  \ It was my first international travel as well and Bhutan made it very evident that\
  \ it was a whole another country, No honking zones, smiling and warm hearted people,\
  \ the spiritual vibe was incredible. As I traveled I noticed 5 colour flags on all\
  \ the high places, the green, red, yellow, blue and white. When I asked the locals\
  \ what was it for? The answer blew my mind. They said that the colourful flags had\
  \ prayers written on them and they were raised on high places so that the wind carries\
  \ all the prayers written on them to every living being and creatures around. And\
  \ the white flags carried the prayers to the dead so that they could rest in peace.\
  \ It changed the whole perspective of life for me, the thought of raising flags\
  \ was such a selfless act and so spiritual which made me think what if all the countries\
  \ around the world had such a noble thought process towards the nature, towards\
  \ the dead and all living beings. Further as I went we came to the base of Tiger\
  \ Monastery, one of my dream treks. We barely spotted the Monastery from below as\
  \ it was between the mountains. I had done trekking before but I had never trekked\
  \ alone. As I climbed I got to know many people, I conversed with them to know more\
  \ about the culture. One thing that I interestingly found common was the stone pillar\
  \ thing which the locals built while climbing. The stone pillar was meant to be\
  \ built placing flat rocks on each other in a vertical position which should be\
  \ odd in number and wish for something. Interestingly I spotted the same ritual\
  \ done in Hampi, Karnataka which is a UNESCO World heritage site and also heard\
  \ that it was done in Russia as well. Further I climbed for almost 5-6 hours where\
  \ I reached first temple which was opposite the Tiger Monastery. It was such a steep\
  \ climb with very small steps, it was risky to climb as the stairs were covered\
  \ with ice which made me slip and if I slipped I would have fallen directly into\
  \ the valley of Tiger Monastery. Yet something in me kept saying I have to do it,\
  \ you can and so I did. I climbed it with a stick in one hand and a rope in other,\
  \ slowly and steadily I reached the top, saw the view and enjoyed my moment as I\
  \ was the only one who went there. I clicked some shots and now was the dreadful\
  \ part. The wind was fascinating but it was freezing cold, when I saw downstairs\
  \ I froze at the sight of the valley. It was hard. But somehow I managed to do it\
  \ and came down again. Then I went to the great Tiger Monastery where people meditated\
  \ in temples and came for blessings from Lord Buddha. It included everyone the elderly\
  \ people, the mothers with their children on their backs, everyone trekked just\
  \ to seek blessings. The temples were amazing in its built and architecture. It\
  \ had various versions of stories wherein it was believed that Guru Padmasambhava\
  \ flew on a flying tiger and landed on the other side of the mountain where the\
  \ Tiger Monastery was situated. Seeking blessings I was climbing down thinking how\
  \ incredible Bhutan is and the noble thought of all the people living there. The\
  \ simple living, the smiling people and spirituality in the air made the my solo\
  \ trip worthwhile. It was an amazing and different experience altogether."
