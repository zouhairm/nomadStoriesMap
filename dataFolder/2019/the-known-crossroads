Text: "Having travelled India all my life.. when \u2018twas time to set my foot across\
  \ the international boundaries, little did I know back then what life had in store\
  \ for me. Coming to the USA was a game changer in all sorts of ways. Small town\
  \ boy out of his  box for the first time, feels and emotions held strongly at bay,\
  \ I knew the price and the gains I would reap from it. It\u2019s always kinda home\
  \ when you visit your siblings no matter where they are. So was New York City for\
  \ me and all the flashes and the extravagant over the top life of the people took\
  \ me with it. It was not just the people, but the city itself breathes now and then.\
  \ Pay close attention and you might feel her chest go up and down, or may be that\
  \ was just the subway.\nBut that was just one road that I crossed.\nWhen I went\
  \ to Arlington Texas to begin this journey of life in the form of my masters degree\
  \ that\u2019s when Myths and legends busted out in the open and real world stepped\
  \ up to me and said kid.. it\u2019s gonna be a hell of a ride from here! New place\
  \ always allows you to expand your horizons and see beyond the bubble that we create\
  \ in our little world, making new friends here and planning impromptu trips is the\
  \ kind of thing everybody digs but sometimes things go south and the plans simply\
  \ shatter. Something like that happened with us when our rented audi a4 busted it\u2019\
  s all four tires at 3 in the night in the middle of nowhere in Arkansas. That was\
  \ the moment I remember vividly when I said to myself boy you are screwed this time\
  \ and you gotta manage it in your own. Being in a tough situation is not that difficult\
  \ until you are the one who needs to hold his own and fight, guess that\u2019s when\
  \ we grow from kid to men to fight our own battles.\nThe question we all thought\
  \ at that moment was that are ever gonna get out of this? \nAnd for 24 hours straight\
  \ none of us had an answer to that. So we began our comeback by searching for any\
  \ car or tire shop in the small town of Arkansas which on a Sunday afternoon felt\
  \ like a zombie break out had happened there. No vehicles no people just the rustic\
  \ town with dried fall leaves rolling on the streets eerily.\nCut off from almost\
  \ every where we couldn\u2019t call people as we didn\u2019t have any network ehere\
  \ we stayed and the internet with our luck was down we had to go full retro. After\
  \ hunting tires in the daytime and driving almost 200 miles to and fro we ended\
  \ up the day playing ping pong and poker to lighten the mood and to prepare for\
  \ the war next day.\nAlthough we didn\u2019t wake up with the birds it kinda felt\
  \ like that going on hunting for some audi a4 tires everywhere for 10 straight hours\
  \ and our efforts finally paid off when a showroom told us that they had 4 tires\
  \ and we could buy them right away.\nWhen we returned to the car that stood near\
  \ a brook in the jungle on wood planks, we managed to put the wheels back on in\
  \ drizzling rains and below zero temperatures. \nThe nightmare had finally ended\
  \ and we were set to go home with the experience that never ever go rash no matter\
  \ what.\nAnd always keep those people close to you who stood with you in your dire\
  \ times.\nHome never felt better than at that night where we relieved the pain and\
  \ agony of those two dreaded days and finally paying off a lot more than we imagined\
  \ we ended the hideous trip in a good note."
