Text: "This was the incident where one rainy morning my friends and I had decided\
  \ to go for excursion. It was for a place called Polo forest. It is approx 150 km\
  \ from Ahmedabad, where I am residing. This place is specially renowned for it\u2019\
  s misty and cloudy weather in monsoon season as it\u2019s on the upper hills. \n\
  \nAs everyone were so keen to visit this place since long time, all got ready instantaneously.\
  \ We began the trip by car accompanied by 5 people. When we left from the house\
  \ it was pretty good weather so we thought of having fun on the way. But as says\
  \ god always have different plans than yours. The moment we reached halfway drizzling\
  \ started. Luckily we all like the rain so we stopped a car and we enjoyed the light\
  \ rain. Without 2.5 hrs we reached to our destination. \nThe real fun just begins\
  \ now. As it was a sudden excursion we haven\u2019t booked any rooms to stay for\
  \ but this place have enough facilities of different kinds of place to stay for.\
  \ There were ample of rooms available but as we all wanted to have more adventurous\
  \ trip we searched out for tents to live in. Which is only available in rainy season\
  \ to make your trip more memorable. With few reference we finally got the two tents,\
  \ one for girls and other for boys. After freshen up we started our tracking to\
  \ explore small mountains. I still have that eyeshot very clear and sharp in my\
  \ mind, what a blissful view it was. As far as I can see I was only feeling moist\
  \ in my hand and hair, a cold windy weather, a silence where I can even heard the\
  \ heartbeat of mine and a bunch of my people with whom I was ready to dive into\
  \ the calmness of mountain to create more memories to cherish forever. \nWhile we\
  \ were tracking we sang a songs, we shared our routine life discussion, we extended\
  \ our hand to each other the moments one felt enfeebled. Till the time we reached\
  \ to the top of the hill we all were realised that not every time a planned trip\
  \ can be successful but the unplanned one too with the bunch of happiness which\
  \ you haven\u2019t feels yet. \n\nOn the top of the hills, we were seeing a small\
  \ tiny house covered with clouds and fog. We were so tired but the view was more\
  \ worthy to forget our all pain. \n\nWe headed back down to our tents and rested\
  \ for a while. In the evening we helped tents organiser to make some food and that\
  \ was also fun to remember for. After finishing the dinner all get charged up again\
  \ to have more fun. As rain was already stopped we could able to light up bonfire.\
  \ That was the cherry on cake for everyone as the weather was so cold to get the\
  \ perfect fire to warm up ourselves. We all played dumb charades. The best game\
  \ to engage everyone to understand the silence of your companions and win the game.\
  \ \n\nIt was almost 1 am but no one was ready to sleep as if we felt that if this\
  \ time will be gone we won\u2019t get it back and we wanted to makes most of it\
  \ worth to lived for. Somehow we convinced ourselves to sleep for as we had to go\
  \ back to home next morning. \nNext morning we woke up had breakfast and headed\
  \ to home. On the way we all were thinking and discussing the only thing and that\
  \ was how one unplanned excursion can be so exquisite where you were not knowing\
  \ what will happened next second and that was the best part of our life to lives\
  \ for. There is no fun in living the things you were already knowing. It will kill\
  \ its charm to make your mind and soul to surprise. \nAt the end what I had learnt\
  \ through my unplanned excursion is , life is so unpredictable and that is it\u2019\
  s best way to live for what it is. Don\u2019t change it just go with flow, face\
  \ the challenges and make it worth remember for ages."
