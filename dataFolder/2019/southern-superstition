Text: "A timid but hopeful voice sounded behind me, \u201CAre you thru-hiking?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CHang on Mom, I gotta go. I have to get a ride into town before it gets\
  \ dark. I'll call ya back when i\u2019m settled for the night. Okay. I will. Love\
  \ you too.\u201D Hanging up I turned.\n\nThe voice had come from a tattered fuchsia\
  \ trench coat swallowing a petite graying woman. Her hair stuck out in many directions,\
  \ challenging my manners. She smiled a large, amiable smile and tilted her head\
  \ like she was going to ask again. \n\n\u201CI plan on making it the whole way,\
  \ but I\u2019ve just started\u201D I explain trying to sound humble.\n\n\u201COh\
  \ dear, you will make it, I can see it in your eyes. You have the same strength\
  \ my son had. \u201D \n\nHad. My smile wavered, unsure how to respond to such a\
  \ personal comment. She spoke again before I had to, offering me a ride into Gatlinburg,\
  \ Tennessee, ten miles east. Here eyes were warm and comforting like only a mother\u2019\
  s could be. I thanked her for the offer and climbed into her haint blue Town & Country\
  \ van. The color, she informed me, was to ward of bad spirits. I didn\u2019t question\
  \ farther. A worn set of prayer beads were wrapped around the rear-view mirror,\
  \ a rabbit foot hung in place of a cross, dancing when we hit bumps. \n\nMost people\
  \ I had met asked me why I was hiking the Appalachian Trail and would gawk when\
  \ they found out I was attempting it alone at 18. They wondered when I started and\
  \ how long I thought it would take me to finish. She didn\u2019t ask me how I got\
  \ food or if I carried a gun to protect myself. She didn\u2019t ask if it was scary\
  \ to sleep alone in the woods or how much my pack weighed. She didn\u2019t ask what\
  \ the best part is or how many miles I average a day. She asked if I was superstitious,\
  \ and when I said no, she asked if she could tell me a story. \n\n\u201CMy son was\
  \ 23 when he thru hiked the Appalachian Trail.\u201D She paused and put her hand\
  \ on her coat pocket, took a breath, and continued, \u201CI would wait, worried\
  \ sick when the phone was silent for just a little too long. The phone always rang\
  \ and he would tell me that he was finer than a frog hair split two ways.\u201D\
  \ She chuckled at the memory. \u201C He was a lovely boy.\u201D Her voice now tinged\
  \ with heartache.\n\nMy friends messaged me, they were staying the night in town.\
  \ I asked if she would bring me to the motel.\n\n\u201COf course, Sugar. Do something\
  \ for me, would ya? Hold out your hand and close your eyes.\u201D\n\nWe pulled into\
  \ the motel lot and she placed a small, hard, round object into my hand, still warm\
  \ from her pocket. It was a dark, almost black, tree nut with a light brown circle\
  \ in the center.\n\n\u201CMy son didn\u2019t think much of it, but he carried one\
  \ everyday, so I wouldn\u2019t worry. I worried anyways.\u201D She smiled. \u201C\
  It brings the holder good luck. I\u2019ve carried mine for 30 years, and now Wyatt\u2019\
  s for six. He forgot his at home the day he died, and I have no use for two.\u201D\
  \ \n\nShe had given me hers and I, feeling undeserving, tried to give it back. She\
  \ insisted I take it. I promised her I would carry it to Katahdin, the last mountain,\
  \ my finish line. \n\nShe squeezed my hand around the seed and held back tears.\
  \ She reassured, \u201CIt\u2019ll keep you safe.\u201D\n\nGrateful, I pocketed my\
  \ prize and hugged her. I would carry it, if not for the luck then for her. I was\
  \ honored to be entrusted with something of such value. I could find another one\
  \ on the forest floor, but this one has 30 years of love and trust already worn\
  \ into it. \n\n\u201CHey Mom, it\u2019s me. Yeah I made it to town. Hey, do you\
  \ know what a Buckeye is?\u201D"
