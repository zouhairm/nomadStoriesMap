Text: "Beautiful pictures paint a vision.\n\nLanded in Amsterdam beautiful city bright\
  \ lights everywhere, new country that everyone talk about going and visiting, it\
  \ was a bright start plane journey only lasted 45 mins from Heathrow airport, which\
  \ was good.\n\nAs I was leaping into the unknown the people where really helpful,\
  \ everybody was offering to direct me into hottest tourist attraction spots, which\
  \ was real fun, stayed in a 4stay hotel in Voorburg called \u201CHotel Den Haag\
  \ Voorburg\u201D which had equisite views outside and inside, with a touch of mediterranean\
  \ lights by the bar, it was defintely a nice place to show off to new local friends\
  \ I met, and my online circle on social media. Just outside the hotel was a Huawei\
  \ head office which was a a beautiful delicate view also there was street round\
  \ the corner filled with local bars and shops, perfect for bringing back souvenirs\
  \ to your loved ones and close friends.\n\nVoorburg was very close to a local city\
  \ called The Hague which was jam packed with lots of things to do, many local residents\
  \ said that The Hague is very similar to Amsterdam but is alot more beautiful which\
  \ was true, they had a wide range of everything you could expect from being in Holland,\
  \ lots of nice food places, my favourite was the Full moon restaurant they had in\
  \ China Town in The Hague, I got to the restaurant challenging myself to an all\
  \ you can eat buffest, 5 rounds with 10 different selections, my stomach barely\
  \ manage to survive second round, but the food was tasty. \n\nOverall my trip to\
  \ Holland was very exciting met the best people there and got to take lots of fascinating\
  \ pictures which is always a bonus if your on snapchat. \n\nWould definitely recommend\
  \ people to visit Holland at least once to have an feel for the area and most of\
  \ all have lots of fun."
