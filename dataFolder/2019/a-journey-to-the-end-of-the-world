Text: "The dread of the hill you want to believe is the last for the day. It is steeper\
  \ than what it appears or that might just be a weakened state, both mental and physical.\
  \ You look around and it is greener than what you could ever have predicted, this\
  \ green is a shade that buries itself deep in memory.\n\nI was steering brick feet\
  \ at this point. Earlier we had come to a hostel and before we could be even foster\
  \ a feeling of relief, the owner yells, \u201Cwe\u2019re full, sorry!\u201D He was\
  \ outside watching as others passed. The six of us kept on with an added weight\
  \ of discontent. An alarming amber was blanketing the gorgeous Galician green, as\
  \ dusk was beginning to salute us. An hour and thirty minutes later and we learned\
  \ what the color of perseverance paints like. Still, there was a synchronized sense\
  \ that we just needed to be supportive amid the delirium we all felt. \n\nWe could\
  \ see ahead a stop with one road that lead to a north/south passageway and nearby\
  \ two restaurants. Neighboring by was what we came to know as a pristine beauty.\
  \ We stumbled upon a cottage that could very well be what you personify as the warmest\
  \ hug you could ever find in these woods. We began to experience relief again, and\
  \ took the time to absorb our layout of comfort as we had the whole top floor to\
  \ ourselves. The entering fireplace made of a greying stone signaled you to unhinge\
  \ your shoulders; the fur rugs revealed a respect for tradition, and the wooden\
  \ artisanal furniture an affinity for the resourcefulness of nature. We took this\
  \ all in and gained our strengths, as the challenges that followed were to be just\
  \ as impactful. \n\nJocee or little patas (foot) initiated the idea to embark on\
  \ this trip to the end of the world as homage to her late mother. The historical\
  \ pilgrimage known as the Camino de Santiago extends to the sea forming a 90 kilometer\
  \ trek that rests at Cape Finisterre; a rocky cliffs edge that holds the sea at\
  \ bay, which in roman times was thought to be the end of the known world. Some of\
  \ us required more convincing than others, but we all agreed and went into it not\
  \ fully knowing what the journey would entail. \n\nThe six of us were sent to Spain\
  \ together as a group of international students, and from this we experienced the\
  \ thrills of life anew; passing courses, discovering cultures, and enjoying celebrations\
  \ together. It was this journey however, that revealed our methods for dealing with\
  \ struggle and from time to time, defeat. It was a feeling we all had coded on our\
  \ faces at any certain time throughout, but we knew someone always had to be the\
  \ higher power to continue us forward and our shared value for laughter always kept\
  \ us tight. We continued along this path trailed of seashells that spoke to you\
  \ as tellers of your oncoming fulfillment. They counted down the kilometers and\
  \ as you see passerby\u2019s backpacks you can locate the seashell, the symbol for\
  \ this journey.  \n\nEarly on, Alex found an expertly proportioned stick to lead\
  \ our trail; with this we passed between us all a sense of responsibility for the\
  \ group, and also a handy go pro extender. Towards its finale you begin to peer\
  \ onto the sea brushing against a steep rocky hillside and from this you know the\
  \ end is coming and your strength jolts. We finally reached the 0 kilometer seashell\
  \ at the top and then hiked down to the very edge of where a romans world would\
  \ end. It was there that we found a perfectly shaped hole for this expertly proportioned\
  \ Spanish walking stick; we placed the stick there to marker our reigning achievement.\
  \ This came to appear as a destined plan for us all, in the end. Every person we\
  \ met on the trail was willing to share something; be it a helping hand, a story\
  \ of resilience, or the encouragement to keep going. It was a vulnerability that\
  \ you award nature and from this she provides for you, a truer sense of self."
