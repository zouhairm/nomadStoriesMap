Text: "It wasn\u2019t my first time in Italy, but it certainly felt like it. It had\
  \ been a while since my last trip abroad and I was unsuccessfully trying to control\
  \ my thrill. The reason? An old time love, not only for a woman, but also for a\
  \ city, Naples.\n\nAs I was getting to the train station in \u201CPiazza Garibaldi\u201D\
  , the memories of a previous trip, years ago, erupted. I had always linked Naples\
  \ to those classical Hollywood movies, sunny beaches facing colorful fishing houses\
  \ packed altogether. Indeed, films like \u201CIt started in Naples\u201D were shot\
  \ in one of the famous bright islands accessible from the Naples harbour, Capri.\n\
  \nBut far from those kinds of settings, I faced the socioeconomic issues in the\
  \ south of Italy, instead. The streets weren\u2019t as neat as I had imagined. The\
  \ \u201Cpiazzas\u201D were full of homeless people \u201Calzando il gomito\u201D\
  , tippling just after waking up from the rumble of this dynamic Italian city.\n\n\
  To counterbalance the East side of Naples, the West side is filled with historical\
  \ buildings and narrow ancient streets, which provide a certain bohemian atmosphere\
  \ to the rich part of the city. At night, these streets are full of people hopping\
  \ from one wine-club to another, as if they were just showing off their natural\
  \ spontaneity and open-hearted personality. \n\nBut this is not the only thing that\
  \ keeps the two Naples together; there\u2019s another one: the fast-paced Italian\
  \ car-driving style, which makes it difficult for any mortal to cross any street\
  \ without risking his life. Cars won\u2019t stop unless they see you already crossing,\
  \ a classic in any list of Italians stereotypes, which happens to be true, at least\
  \ in Naples.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s one of the things that attracted me the most in\
  \ Lucia, the charming perkiness that seemed to drive her life. That same kind of\
  \ energy is seen in the Neapolitan district of the same name \u201CSanta Lucia\u201D\
  . This picturesque neighbourhood is located at the beginning of a modern street\
  \ area, as if its intention would be to connect the old with the new.\n\nFarther\
  \ down towards the sea, the Southern part of \u201CVia Santa Lucia\u201D is a colorful\
  \ place where the street gets narrower, and the hanging laundry provides a sense\
  \ of familiarity. There, the tenants from opposite balconies passionately converse,\
  \ heavily using their hands and body to convey meaning and emotion, in a much faster\
  \ and more accurate way than the dialogue itself.\n \nFrom there, it was inevitable\
  \ to see the five-towered \u201CCastel dell\u2019Ovo\u201D, a castle located in\
  \ the tiny, yet tremendously poetic, \u201Cislotto di Magaride\u201D, connected\
  \ to the peninsula through a long-standing cobblestone bridge. The castle stands\
  \ out in the coast the same way a lighthouse would challenge the sea in a stormy\
  \ day; only, in this case, the sun was bright in the sky, seemingly admiring the\
  \ invisible power of the small fortress.\n\nAs I walked on the paving stone, my\
  \ feet felt the uneven ground, typical of that architecture\u2019s time-period.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t resist thinking that those paving stones, very different from\
  \ one another, could be, in fact, comparable to me and Lucia, with somewhat opposing\
  \ personalities, though if paved together could form a solid bridge that resists\
  \ the force of the sea.\n\nUnfortunately, reality didn\u2019t withstand this comparison,\
  \ and the sea did separate us, sending me back to Barcelona. This trip wasn\u2019\
  t meant for a reunion either, but I couldn\u2019t resist reminiscing about her,\
  \ and entertaining the titillating idea of a casual running into each other.\n\n\
  Little did I know, destiny was keeping an eye out for us. My little body tingling\
  \ wasn\u2019t just a dizzying sensation from the sea. In one of the outdoor terraces\
  \ of Magaride Island\u2019s tiny cafes, there she was, sipping a cup of tea, staring\
  \ at the immensity of the sea. The 8 years that had passed since we last saw each\
  \ other were now condensed in 25 meters of distance. She was listening to the birds,\
  \ as they tweeted in the sunset, maybe hoping for one to say hey, or maybe, just\
  \ maybe\u2026 waiting for me to come back."
