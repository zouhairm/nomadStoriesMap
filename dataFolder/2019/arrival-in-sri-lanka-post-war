Text: "I was twelve years old when my father chose the jewel of the Indian Ocean for\
  \ a holiday. My grandmother begged us to reconsider. She argued the war was far\
  \ from over, the Tamil cease-fire being temporary at best, and a father-son package\
  \ from the suburbs of Melbourne would be obvious targets for kidnapping. Undeterred\
  \ and seeking adventure, we booked a flight to Sri Lanka. \n\nA feeling of foreboding\
  \ swept over us on arrival. The visage of armed military personnel standing idle\
  \ in an airport struck the senses, my father noting aloud that a number of automatic\
  \ firearms had the safety off. I wondered if my grandmother was wiser than we bargained\
  \ for. Despite the apparent danger, we were processed without delay, finding ourselves\
  \ lost in an otherwise deserted airport in the dark hours of the morning. \n\nSsearching\
  \ for the hotel transfer proved an unexpected and undesirable challenge, as the\
  \ rabid horde of airport touts and beggars we had read about never arrived. Instead\
  \ we searched through a silent car park, eventually discovering a driver who claimed\
  \ to have been waiting for hours. This large and imperious man directed us into\
  \ a shiny car, before taking off at high speed into poorly lit back streets punctuated\
  \ by dim, unevenly placed streetlights. \nI watched the dusty road pass by. Every\
  \ lane was glazed with the yellow of old lamps, occasionally populated by cripples\
  \ and small groups of men squatting in the gutter, gesticulating wildly. Meanwhile,\
  \ my father, the strongest man I had ever known, whispered to me in the dark, urging\
  \ me to run in the event of a violent attack. Sitting helpless in the back of a\
  \ speeding car, each of us feared the worst. \n\nWithout warning, the vehicle slammed\
  \ to a halt. The burly driver threw open our doors, popped the boot, and dropped\
  \ our luggage on the ground.  He demanded a price for his service despite knowing\
  \ we had prepaid the transfer. Alone and only tentatively certain we had arrived\
  \ to the correct destination as-yet unmolested, we paid the driver, who promptly\
  \ sped off into the darkness. \n\n Hot, sweating, adrenaline-charged and overtired,\
  \ we crept into a hotel as dark as the streets we had driven through. We soon discovered\
  \ a hotel manager asleep at his desk. He appeared bewildered when my father woke\
  \ him, but quickly confirmed we had arrived. He waggled his head and smiled, welcoming\
  \ us to his hotel, the Silver Sands.  \n\nIn that moment, my perspective transformed\
  \ from trepidation to anticipation, as a new wonderland opened up before me. Moonlight\
  \ splashed into the hallway as we followed our host to the room, illuminating antique\
  \ Spanish archways and whitewashed walls surrounding a grassy courtyard, paved intermittently\
  \ with stepping-stones. I looked up. A vision of vines dangling over pale terraces\
  \ greeted my eyes, backed by bedroom balconies leaning over the courtyard as moonlight\
  \ played off pre-war barricades. The sound of the ocean washed over the scene, and\
  \ then we were indoors, up the stairs, stepping into our room. \n\nA dim lamp in\
  \ the corner revealed a couple of mosquito-net covered beds with an ornate ceiling\
  \ fan revolving slowly overhead. I rushed to our balcony, looking down at the flat\
  \ first-floor rooftop. I was rewarded with a view worthy of M.M. Kaye\u2019s Far\
  \ Pavilions. My senses were ready to romanticise this country, and the Silver Sands\
  \ presented every opportunity to do so. From a position of fear had come unexpected\
  \ delight.\n\nFrom there the sun was our alarm clock, breakfast a sensory treat:\
  \ oven-baked toast ready with fresh butter and a spread of mango and pineapple jam.\
  \ Everything from palm fronds leaning through arched, glassless restaurant windows,\
  \ to the taste of pure Sri Lankan tea felt entirely tropical, a breath of wild,\
  \ positive energy. The hotel staff were by far some of the most attentive, polite\
  \ people I had ever met. We had truly underestimated and misinterpreted the soul\
  \ of Sri Lanka. Outside, a long, beautiful beach awaited, and beyond that, an entire\
  \ nation as yet undiscovered by two captivated travellers. I knew this would be\
  \ a grand adventure."
