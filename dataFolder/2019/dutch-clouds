Text: "The first night I arrived in Amsterdam I realised that perhaps my living arrangement\
  \ was not going to work.\nI have been taught bargains must never be spurned;  the\
  \ man I had met at a Jazz bar, from my previous trip to Amsterdam, had offered a\
  \ place to stay. We spoke for a time. I stalked his social media to see if he was\
  \ a murderer. We got on. Thankfully he wasn't a murderer. So I booked my flights\
  \ and came to Amsterdam.\n\nThe night was a dripping one, full of sleet and melting\
  \ orange lights. He came to meet me at the airport and we sat on the bus ride for\
  \ an hour in which he spoke of nothing but himself.  The hour after that, again\
  \ the preferred topic was him. \nI appreciate his generosity in opening his home.\
  \ And realised, a little deflated, that he had no obligation to meet my admittedly\
  \ high expectations. Before I arrived I was praying for a friend, a connection.\
  \ In him I saw the opportunity to find a companion perhaps- a person who would maybe\
  \ cure some of my loneliness. No it wasn't his fault. But the tragedy of fantasy\
  \ is, the reality always inevitably disappoints. \n\nWe got to his flat which was\
  \ in one of the many quintessentially  Dutch canal houses, but there was no rest\
  \ for me yet. His friends wanted to meet me and check that I too was not a murderer.\
  \ I had to oblige.\n\nI was whisked away to the back room of a pub I imagined was\
  \ the kind of place revolutions were born. It was reserved only for the group of\
  \ friends who sat assembled in plush armchairs, sharing expensive bottles of whiskey\
  \ and wine between them. Their discontent was voiced through deadpan jokes, their\
  \ friendliness and familiarity manifested in homely sarcasm. I could barely keep\
  \ up with the conversation but each would take the turn of ambassador, and explain\
  \ to me the subject of their chats. I appreciated their natural instincts to include.\
  \ Never once did I feel like a wall was between any of us. \n\nWe hurried through\
  \ the snow and canal black darkness. It was time to go home.  We tried to make ourselves\
  \ smaller so the cold might leave us alone but still our voices became crystallised,\
  \ our breaths the frost. But I found some heat in mine and my host's friend hot\
  \ red conversation. \nShe gossiped and confessed and was adamant to hear whether\
  \ I was indeed just sleeping on the sofa (I was) and how he was treating me. From\
  \ what I heard my host was not a bad man but, in her words, 'An arrogant prick'.\
  \  Our laughter rang shrill, more like the cackle of witches.\nLooking back on my\
  \ holiday it could have gone drastically different if I had stayed with him. But\
  \ Amsterdam is full of guardian angel it seems. Especially a drunk, electric haired\
  \ dutch woman who had decided we were best friends now. \n\"I'll take her.\" My\
  \ angel decreed to him., \"She's staying at mine.\"\nAnd I did. She marched me through\
  \ the night like a soldier. I needed to get my things back but there was no reasoning\
  \ with drunk logic. That's a matter for tomorrow she said. Tomorrow's tomorrow.\
  \ Tonights tonight. \n\nWe'd shared a bed that night. It bought back memories of\
  \ sleepovers in secondary school. A nest of crisps, popcorn and blankets had been\
  \ made around us. The window was open and she was hanging out of it, puffing industriously\
  \ on a spliff as she eyed the sunrise. She told me to come and look. I stood beside\
  \ her, overlooking the old rambling skyline.  She pointed not to the sun, but to\
  \ the clouds which looked as though they were painted. \"Dutch clouds\", she explained.\
  \ And so I learned that nations have their own clouds. And she was right in a way.\
  \ Dutch clouds were a classical artists interpretation of what clouds are supposed\
  \ to be. Large, fluffy, white, and slightly unreal. As was everything in Amsterdam\
  \ really. Reality painted by a romantic. Or maybe I was the artist guilty of painting\
  \ those memories. Because even the rain was golden."
