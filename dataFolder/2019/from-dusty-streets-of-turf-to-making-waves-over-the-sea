Text: "I was once A rural girl From the villages of mankweng,with a dream to go to\
  \ Atlanta USA.when my peers dreamed of going to local universities.she dreamed of\
  \ states universities . She dreamed of a future over the sea , she dreamed of making\
  \ Waves over that see & making name in the film industry but was it possible to\
  \ go there with a disadvantaged background ? I mean being raised by a single parent\
  \ who was unemployed seemed to be impossible but i knew i have to make her proud\
  \ . When i passed my 12th grade with B & 3 distinctions \ni knew i was close to\
  \ reach my goal of going oversea.The big city lights,sea, weaves, exploring and\
  \ the good life over the sea.well i  was not a dreamer but visionary. Many people\
  \ laughed at my big dreams of being a model in the states and study there but that\
  \ gave me hope to work hard stand firm and tall. It was 2017 September when her\
  \ dream finally became reality.she was accepted at  Gsu ,i pinched  my self five\
  \ times i thought i was dreaming .i was so excited and nervous too. My first time\
  \ to go over the sea and my first time on a plane . Excitement clouded me . Somebody\
