Text: "\u201CWhere are all the women?\u201D, I ask the short, Indian man stood next\
  \ to me, as we both witness an assortment of fires burn beside the river. His smile\
  \ reveals a jigsaw-like mouth, his few remaining teeth stained red by the chewing\
  \ tobacco that is consumed by the locals routinely.\n\nHe gestures his head side\
  \ to side, a subtle nod, in the distinctively Indian way, and gently brings his\
  \ eyelids closers together in a kind of contemplative squint. \u201CWomen do not\
  \ come here, for they have soft hearts\u201D, he insists, \u201Cbut men just cry\
  \ on the inside.\u201D\n\nDeath is a taboo where I\u2019m from. An ominous topic,\
  \ carefully tiptoed around, avoiding the the reality of our impermanence. In India,\
  \ religious traditions dictate different attitudes towards death, which are reflected\
  \ by the ancient rituals that continue to be performed. On the banks of the Ganges\
  \ river, bodies burn 24 hours a day.\n\nVaranasi is a holy town. Supposedly the\
  \ world\u2019s oldest continually inhabited city, it remains a sacred destination\
  \ for Hindus across India, who make the journey East as a kind of spiritual pilgrimage.\
  \ \n\nThe most notable visitors are the dying, with wishes to be ritually cremated\
  \ beside the sacred Ganges river, or \u2018Mother Ganga\u2019. They believe that\
  \ when their bodies are burned and their ashes are offered to the river, they can\
  \ avoid rebirth and instead, be transported to heaven, or \u2018Moksha\u2019.\n\n\
  The sick and elderly lay in rooms up the steps from the areas of water designated\
  \ for burning corpses, where they wait to die. Others, who arrive by way of their\
  \ grieving relatives, are already dead.\n\nThe bodies of the dead are carried on\
  \ bamboo stretchers, held together by thin pieces of rope, through the city\u2019\
  s narrow streets and down to the waters edge. The men, who carry the bodies of relatives\
  \ and friends on their shoulders, chant prayers in unison as they ceremonially lower\
  \ corpses into the holy water. Emotions gets the better of a few of them, and it\
  \ seems that some men do, in fact, cry on the outside too.\n\nA few meters in front\
  \ of me, the body of a large, elderly woman is laid on the floor, her clothes drenched\
  \ by the cloudy water they have just been dunked in. A group of locals begin covering\
  \ her torso in wooden branches, though her head and feet remain in view, sticking\
  \ out from either end of the pile.\n\nA skinny man, wearing nothing but a white\
  \ sheet tied at his waist, lights the wood that covers the dead woman. The body\
  \ catches fire and begins to burn quickly. I feel the heat  from the fire on my\
  \ own body grow as the flames do.\n\nThe skin burns first. Facial features start\
  \ to fade as flames melt brown flesh, that disintegrates quickly into a pile of\
  \ ash that forms beneath. The firewood, the dead woman's limbs and the clothes that\
  \ once covered them, all wither into grey dust.\n\nFor those accustomed to a less\
  \ visible experience of the process of death, witnessing corpses being set on fire\
  \ is a surreal experience. In the West, funerals are often subdued affairs, where\
  \ bodies are hidden in coffins and people wear black in solemn respect. Here at\
  \ the \u2018burning ghats\u2019, the areas of the river bank reserved from cremations,\
  \ thousands of white faces observe a different kind of spectacle.\n\nI look into\
  \ the fire with my toothless friend, neither of us speaking a word, while others\
  \ make noise around us. I hear the sounds of prayer being recited continually over\
  \ the distant racket of cows and car horns that are inescapable here.\n\nThe remains\
  \ of the elderly woman form into a small pile on the steps in front of me. Pieces\
  \ of charred bone and the ashes of her burned flesh are tossed into the river by\
  \ the same sheet-clad man who started the fire.\n\nAs evidence of the cremation\
  \ is quickly removed, I hear the faint sound of the chanting of prayers grow louder\
  \ from behind me and another body is lowered onto the same steps."
