Text: "The emotion that the Portuguese word 'SAUDADE' expresses is the feeling of\
  \ longing and nostalgia. \nHaving a plan makes a person feel safe and secure about\
  \ their future. However, adventures and miracles take place on impromptu trips.\
  \ \nIn the year 2013 June 16th, a turmoil took place in Kedarnath Temple, Uttarakhand,\
  \ India. The entire nagar in Rudraprayag district was flooded due to a massive cloudburst.\
  \ Me and my family were present at the very place where it took place. We were supposed\
  \ to walk upward toward the temple but due to bad weather condition we decided to\
  \ stay in. After a while my father and my uncle went outside and came to know that\
  \ the police is making an announcement asking people to evacuate the area. We started\
  \ rushing towards our vehicle which was parked 2kms away from our stay. We had to\
  \ cross landslides by walking with our bags in our hand in between the congested\
  \ crowd and water flowing from the mountains on our right. Without knowing the cause\
  \ of evacuation we had to rush in a haphazard manner during which we met a family\
  \ of 12 who coincidently were from our hometown and lived just two lanes apart from\
  \ our home. They were walking to their bus which was parked at a distance of less\
  \ than 2kms. They immediately offered us a lift. On reaching where their bus was\
  \ parked, 8 of us realized that they had only 8 seats left in it. Now is that Luck\
  \ or what? \nWe started moving, on the route was a gorge on our left and mountains\
  \ on the right. I peeped down the window to see what really was happening as we\
  \ were still unaware of the situation. What met my eyes was devastating and heartbreaking.\
  \ I could see parts of buses/cars flowing in the water stream at a rapid speed.\
  \ Not only that but clothes, trees and so many other things turning the blue water\
  \ brown. We reached our traveller in no time as I was busy taking pictures of everything\
  \ on my way. Despite being told to keep my iPad inside and being serious about the\
  \ situation I was constantly taking pictures. Why did I do so? I believe in living\
  \ large. We knew the situation was taking a toll on all of us but I was positive\
  \ and I wanted to be present in the moment because we didn't know what could happen\
  \ next, surprisingly I didn't have to make an effort in doing so and that is how\
  \ I know I am made to travel and explore because I am not afraid of what life has\
  \ to offer me in the succeeding stages.\nWe crossed a lot of towns in intervals\
  \ of 12-24 hours. At one of the Ashrams, we met a family from New Delhi who had\
  \ lost their car in the flood and were left with only their phones. We then asked\
  \ the family of 4 to travel with us. Luck coincides again when the family realized\
  \ that we only had 4 seats left. We drove safely to our destination with a few breaks\
  \ in between.\nWe reached home and got to know about Kedarnath's biggest tragedy\
  \ after 4 days since we had no mobile connection in the mountains to contact anyone.\
  \ We felt truly blessed to have reached home safe and sound. I have had a lot of\
  \ experiences in my life but this gives me the most chills. I wanted to share this\
  \ story because I want this story to be heard. That trip made me realize how precious\
  \ life is and how we take it for granted some times. It feels like my soul had woken\
  \ up after that trip. I will always feel thankful for not panicking and being a\
  \ sport even at such a tough time. \nI feel this scholarship would be a great opportunity\
  \ for me as I want to be an Art director whose skill is the art of storytelling.\n\
  \nAs after the Kedarnath trip, the world around me feels that I am living a second\
  \ life and I want to make the most of it by never losing an opportunity of doing\
  \ what I love."
