Text: "TODAY WAS AN EMOTIONAL JOURNEY.\n\nI think I cried for the first time in a\
  \ while.\n\nI always thought crying was about yourself. Many people do, and perhaps\
  \ it is. But I notice when I cry (on the rare occasions I allow myself too) it is\
  \ spontaneous, and always for other people and things.\n\nSometimes things I am\
  \ vaguely aware of.\n\nTHINKING OF GOING TO VIETNAM\n\nTraveling today through the\
  \ jungles of Northern Thailand. I thought strongly of Vietnam, a place I was considering\
  \ traveling to after Thailand.\n\nTHINKING OF THE WAR\n\nParticularly this song\
  \ by Creedence Clearwater Revival called \u201CThe Fortunate Son\u201D popped in\
  \ my head.\n\n\nIt\u2019s about the Vietnam War, and those \u201Cunfortunate sons\u201D\
  \ who were sent off to Vietnam from 1955-1975.\n\nAmong those killed (Vietnamese,\
  \ American, French, etc) were an estimated 1,353,000 according to professor emeritus\
  \ Guenter Lewy (of the University of Massachusetts Amherst).\n\nAmong those not\
  \ sent were my uncles (from Long Island) in the 1970\u2019s who narrowly missed\
  \ the draft, and my own grandfather (from France) in the 1950\u2019s who supposedly\
  \ broke his leg in a Greco-Roman wrestling match before his battalion was sent off\
  \ to the infamous massacre at Dien Bien Phu.\n\nSCARS OF VIETNAM\n\nThough this\
  \ may seem like the ancient past. I believe these scars from Vietnam still permeate\
  \ the American (and French) psyche today. And that it is important for us to remember\
  \ such things. So, we may have a peaceful future.\n\nFor so many people to have\
  \ died for nothing in a war against an indigenous people claiming sovereignty is\
  \ so terrifyingly sad.\n\nIt is for all the people who didn\u2019t make it, those\
  \ unfortunate sons (Vietnamese, American, French, etc.) that I cried. To see how\
  \ precious life is\u2026\n\nBRINGING IT BACK\n\nIt brought me back to the conversation\
  \ I had with Gabby and Guy (from my post Pai: The Last of the Sacred Medicine).\n\
  \nWe had spoke of peace, and the evolution of humanity beyond nationality, races,\
  \ etc.\n\nWe all had agreed, but it was so hard for Guy to accept because of the\
  \ difficulty of his country, Israel\u2019s situation.\n\nNo one spoke of personal\
  \ or overly emotional things, but we all agreed how beautiful it was that an Austrian,\
  \ an American, and Israeli could come together in Peace considering the last half-a-century.\n\
  \nREMEMBERING THE PAST\n\nThus, let us remember the past when we travel. So, we\
  \ can make a better future\u2026\n\nAnd God bless the hippies for helping stop the\
  \ Vietnam War (at least in America). We are eternally grateful to you!"
