Text: "My first experience with teaching was just after my graduation. It was a primary\
  \ school. I was appointed to teach class IV. I was both excited and anxious in equal\
  \ measures.\n\n\n \nOn my first day of school, the principal told me that I had\
  \ to take the Lower Nursery class since the teacher was sick and on leave. My own\
  \ class would be managed by the class teacher of class V.\n\nAs I walked into my\
  \ new class, I saw little faces with tears streaming down their eyes looking at\
  \ me, having left the warmth of their homes, their parents and pets, surrounded\
  \ by strangers, they felt at sea for it was their first day at school like me.\n\
  \nI decided to cheer them up. I introduced myself, most of them looked at me vacantly.\
  \ I decided to ask their names afterwards, instead I drew an apple on the board,\
  \ and asked them to identify the object. Most knew the answer, they sat and answered.\
  \ Suddenly one child stood up and said. \u201CI like bananas.\u201D There seemed\
  \ to be a transformation in the class, with each student trying to tell me what\
  \ his or her favorite fruit was.\n\nI was relieved, they were not crying anymore.\
  \ Next I sketched a bird, which drew giggles in the class. My drawing wasn\u2019\
  t that bad surely, I then realized that the little ones were excited.\n\u201CThat\
  \ is Mithoo my parrot\". One girl with a lot of curls on her head said.\nVery soon\
  \ the class was discussing their pets. Some had rabbits, guinea pigs even dogs.\n\
  I smiled as I looked at them.\n\nDuring the lunch break, some of them came and offered\
  \ me pastries and fruits. When I told them that I had brought my lunch and my mother\
  \ would get hurt if I didn\u2019t finish my lunch, they went back quietly and started\
  \ eating their tiffin.\n\nWhen school was over, they smiled and waved out to me,\
  \ they would not dread coming to school tomorrow I was sure of that.\n\nFrom tomorrow\
  \ their class teacher would teach them the curriculum, designed to help the child\
  \ unfold his/her talents. I just wanted them to relax, be happy and learn to love\
  \ school, for me it was a new day."
