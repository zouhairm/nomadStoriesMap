Text: 'When I was young, I traveled with my parents by train to California through
  Arizona and other cities such as New Mexico and Colorado. This was a very picturesque
  trip with desert in California, the mountains in Colorado, and desert in Arizona.
  When in California, we visited Hollywood and went to the Chinese Theater where we
  spent one day looking at all the stars'' footprints. We went to Disneyland another
  day and traveled through the Hollywood Hills and saw people''s mansions. We went
  to Hollywood Studios where we had a lot of experiences with rides where we would
  go on rides. We spent two days in Knott''s Berry Farm where we rode a roller coaster
  for the first time. Things were really interesting and fun. We learned about movies
  and how they were made. Overall, a great traveling experience. All the scenic beauty
  of the three days we were on the train was very picturesque. When we were sitting
  at the cafe of the train, we met several people. One was a guy who was 19 by himself.
  He was from Colorado. Another was from California. Overall, this trip was marvelous!

  We traveled by car through the desert in Arizona. We saw the Great Canyon. Deer
  would come by our windows in the car and visit us. In general, it was awesome and
  I will never forget this trip.'
