Text: "They say it\u2019s better to visit Lviv in winter, especially on holidays.\
  \ So I went there on Christmas and got to a fairy tale. \n\nWalking around Lviv\
  \ is like going along a path of time where a different epoch appears at every turn\
  \ and architectural masterpieces of the gothic, renaissance, baroque and other styles\
  \ come into view. You can stroll in this city for hours admiring the old streets\
  \ and unexpectedly find majestic palaces, mansions, cathedrals and temples. \n\n\
  I was rambling over Lviv and besides the buildings that riveted my attention, I\
  \ found public places that were impossible to pass by. \n\nJust like that, I was\
  \ wandering along the narrow and vivid streets at night and a man who was wearing\
  \ a coat and a cylindrical hat invited me to come into one of the buildings. It\
  \ was like an alchemy laboratory inside and there were lots of plants and cupboards\
  \ full of potions of different colors. There were also long and large glass vessels\
  \ with boiling liquids above the counter where the visitors could buy potions that\
  \ in fact were liqueurs with nice names like \u201Cpotion of immortality\u201D and\
  \ \u201Clove potion\u201D. One more interesting thing is a restaurant upstairs that\
  \ occupies some stories and has a great collection of gas lamps. Visitors can try\
  \ European cuisine and continue the potion sampling there. \n\nAnother place, which\
  \ I consider one of the most interesting in Lviv, is their Chocolate Workshop. When\
  \ you walk there, you feel as if you were a young wizard that had come to Hogsmeade.\
  \ The workshop is a fabulous three-storey house where you can buy different types\
  \ of chocolate and even see how the workers make it. There is also an area where\
  \ you can sit at the table and have a cup of hot chocolate. \n\nThe city is full\
  \ of cozy coffee houses lit by candles. This way the atmosphere inside is getting\
  \ even warmer. By the way, Lviv coffee is considered the best one in Ukraine. \n\
  \nNo doubts that Lviv has its own spirit and on Christmas it gets fantastic indeed.\
  \ \n\nWould I go there one more time? \u2013 Yes! Next time I would go there in\
  \ summer to see its beautiful green parks and gardens. \n\nAnd this wonderful city\
  \ is in the country where I live. I didn\u2019t need to overcome long distances\
  \ to have such admirable travel. Maybe, not far from the place where you live is\
  \ located an interesting small town or an ancient city, a dormant volcano or snow-capped\
  \ mountains where you haven\u2019t been yet. If your answer is \u201Cyes\u201D,\
  \ then what are you waiting for?"
