Text: "If my younger self was looking at my past few days, she likely would have been\
  \ bored. My current self has been content to relax and sit with the ebbs and flows\
  \ of Cambodian rural life. I'm staying at a homestay 30 minutes west of Siem Reap\
  \ by tuktuk on potholed, dusty, red roads, but a lifetime away from the typical\
  \ tourist haunts like Pub Street and the Night Market.\n\nThe first morning I awake\
  \ to the serene sound of monks chanting in the distance, overlaid with the occasional\
  \ rooster crowing. Through my mosquito net and open window beyond the red sphere\
  \ sun rises over the ricefields. The dewey grass tickles my feet on my walk to the\
  \ bathroom. The toilet appears Western style, though the flush handle is just for\
  \ show. Instead, I scoop a bucket of water from the large plastic tub and use it\
  \ to flush. It's the same bucket that I use to dump water over my head for my shower.\
  \ Though the temperature has not dropped below 25 degrees, I still have to count\
  \ down to the first shock of cold water.\n\nAfter a Cambodian breakfast of fried\
  \ noodles, pork, and greens I walk to the village nearby to explore. I wander the\
  \ tiny market and see women scaling shimmering fish and children playing under tables\
  \ where people are cleaving apart pigs and chickens. The scents are an assault to\
  \ my nostrils so I move toward the fresh smell of cilantro and lime in the produce\
  \ area, the bold colours of dragonfruit and mangos drawing my attention. As I linger\
  \ near a watermelon stand watching life unfold, the family who owns the stand brings\
  \ out another red plastic chair, inviting me to sit with them in the shade. For\
  \ a long time I observe the women cross stitching, children riding home from school\
  \ (often 3 per bicycle), the ice truck delivering huge blocks of ice to each home,\
  \ families Jenga-ing a week\u2019s worth of groceries and 4 people onto a scooter.\
  \ Because I've slowed down to experience the moments I am able to see the intricacies\
  \ of Cambodian life.\_\n\nThe watermelon family charades to indicate that they want\
  \ to share their freshly made lunch with me. They serve small bowls first to their\
  \ religious altar, then a large bowl to me. The mom stands and watches me eat the\
  \ (delicious if I don't think about it) fish head lettuce wraps and huge portion\
  \ of rice. I am humbled that these people who don\u2019t have much are so generous\
  \ and welcoming to me. \n\nEach day since I have walked to the village. When my\
  \ watermelon family sees me, they immediately pull over the red chair that invites\
  \ me into the fold of their lives. The women cluck amongst one another, stitching\
  \ and tending to customers, often with babies on their hips. The children are called\
  \ over to translate. A brief description of my unimaginable life. I\u2019m not sure\
  \ that they understand what snow is. 30 hours of flying to get here? They shake\
  \ their heads and pass around snacks.\nSchool children ride by and, seeing me, start\
  \ asking their well practiced script of English questions: What is your name? Where\
  \ are you from? How many brothers and sisters do you have? How old are you?.\n\n\
  In the evenings I\u2019m mesmerized by the stories from my homestay family. The\
  \ dad, Maden, is like a cat with 9 lives, surviving the Khmer Rouge, living on the\
  \ streets, falling victim to human trafficking and slavery on a fishing boat, a\
  \ harrowing journey through Thailand to return to Cambodia, and 3 bouts of malaria\
  \ in the jungle. He had a vision of creating this rural homestay. He said that the\
  \ neibouring people laughed at him. He has built it, and we have come. Each of the\
  \ four rooms is booked for the duration of my stay.\n\nAs the tuktuk drives me back\
  \ to the city of Siem Reap we go past the watermelon stand. My family jumps up to\
  \ waive to me and my vision is blurred by tears. This brief experience of connection\
  \ is one not easily replicated, especially in my fast paced western world."
