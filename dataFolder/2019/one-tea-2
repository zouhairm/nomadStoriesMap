Text: "I was there.\n\nDrinking a cup of tea 11,343 kilometres far away from my house.\
  \ I felt the endorphin around my whole body. When I decided took a flight from Colombia\
  \ to Turkey? How I came here? It was inevitable that a couple of tears rolled down\
  \ my face. I started walking through the streets of Istanbul and my only company\
  \ was my backpack, Google Maps and my camera. A lot of people told me: \"how are\
  \ you going alone to a new country? You're going to get lost\". And yes, they were\
  \ right. I got lost a thousand times and I was never happy as in those moments.\
  \ \n\nTime for one tea. Walking through sellers of corn, chestnuts, history and\
  \ tourists. I can't explain the emotion of hear a person speaking my same language.\
  \ When I saw me in the middle of the loud Turkish people, I started to miss talk\
  \ in Spanish. Until now, their obsession for smoke -everywhere and anytime- converted\
  \ me on a passive smoker. \n\nOne more tea. I lost the count of the times that my\
  \ masochistic impulse of eat spicy food let me with crying eyes and numbness lips.\
  \ This is the taste of Turkey: like tea\u2026 cucumber, tomatoes and olives; like\
  \ kebab, yogurt and spices; like an eternal cigarette. Turkey taste like happiness\
  \ with a drop of nostalgy.\n\nOther tea? One funny fact: I don't like the tea; but\
  \ yes, I want other tea. \nI'm still here, 181 days after arriving. Here, taking\
  \ off my shoes when I enter in a house; hearing the calling to pray in the mosque\
  \ 5 times per day; drinking tea and Turkish coffee all my days; eating onion and\
  \ spicy food as I never thought I would; living all the things that I dreamed when\
  \ I was fourteen.\n\nHere I am, and the tea never was so delicious as right now."
