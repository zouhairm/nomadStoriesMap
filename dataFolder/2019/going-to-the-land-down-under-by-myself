Text: "We arrived at the airport three hours before my plane was about to leave for\
  \ Bangkok (then Sydney). My brother-in-law was kind enough to drive us. We parked\
  \ the car in the jammed parking lot of Brussels Airport. My father and brother-in-law\
  \ offered to carry my bags. There was a weird atmosphere between us because I was\
  \ feeling very anxious as I had never traveled on my own before. We got out of the\
  \ parking lot and started walking towards the departure hall. Being at the airport\
  \ had a sad feeling to it too, seeing only a year ago there was a terrorist attack\
  \ here, killing fourteen people and injuring a hundred. I guess I was supposed to\
  \ feel scared something like that would happen again but that's not what I was afraid\
  \ of. I was afraid of what was coming. I had no idea what Australia would be like\
  \ in real life. Of course I had done my research and knew a bit about the country.\
  \ I also talked to a lot of people that had backpacked there so I had some idea\
  \ of what to expect.\nI checked in my suitcase and it was time to walk to security,\
  \ only my father and mother, sister and brother-in-law couldn't go any further,\
  \ so we had to say our inevitable goodbyes. I had promised myself I wasn't going\
  \ to cry but it was a promise I could not keep. I gave everyone a hug but when I\
  \ hugged my sister, she started crying, so I started crying. \nWaiting for my flight\
  \ to leave I videocalled my brother because he was not able to come to the airport\
  \ to say goodbye, so we said goodbye over the phone. He wished me good luck and\
  \ told me how proud he was of me for going on this adventure on my own, to a country\
  \ on the other side of the world. This was probably the nicest thing my brother\
  \ had ever said to me. \nWe were never a close family so I think saying goodbye\
  \ and being on opposite sides of the world than your family must be more difficult\
  \ for people that are, but still, I was going to miss them. \nI didn't mind the\
  \ long flight and layover in Bangkok. I could, however, not wait to arrive in Sydney.\n\
  Once arrived in Sydney, my anxiety got out of control. I had to show my passport\
  \ at the border control, get my luggage and get through customs. If you've ever\
  \ seen the TV show about the Australian border control and customs, you would be\
  \ nervous too.\nI had simply declared anything I thought they might want to know\
  \ on the yellow card you have to fill out on the plane. Luckily, everything was\
  \ fine.\nThe shuttle bus from the tour I paid for for my first week was waiting\
  \ for me. I got in and started talking to another backpacker. \"This is easy,\"\
  \ I thought. \"Who knew meeting new people was this easy?\" This was important to\
  \ me because it was one of the reasons I had deciced to embark on my adventure through\
  \ Australia. After a quarter-life crisis at 25, breaking up with my boyfriend and\
  \ moving back in with my parents, I wanted to know who I was. I wanted to meet new\
  \ people from all over the world. I wanted to become less shy in meeting new people\
  \ and try to be less introverted. I wanted to see the world because I have the rest\
  \ of my life to work. And what better country to start in than in Australia?\nOnce\
  \ I had arrived at my hostel and had checked in, I went to my dorm room to try to\
  \ get my jet lag under control. In my ten-bed-dorm were a lot of backpackers. I\
  \ talked to a nice guy from Scotland and some girls who turned out to be English.\
  \ Little did I know then that that guy, who was really attractive, would later disrupt\
  \ my well-needed sleep by having sex in a dorm full of people. This did not ruin\
  \ my first day/night in Australia but it did not make for a very nice start either."
