Text: "The Homework Club volunteers were planning a trip to the Victoria Falls. We\
  \ could afford to take up to 40 of the older kids and Henry\u2019s name was at the\
  \ top of the list. When he wasn\u2019t cracking jokes or focusing on homework, he\
  \ was telling volunteers about how badly he wanted to see the falls. He was eight\
  \ years old, lived thirty minutes away from the falls but had never been! \nThe\
  \ Monday before the trip, I arrived to Homework Club and heard that Henry had been\
  \ rushed to the hospital the day before. He had cerebral malaria, the worst kind\
  \ of a life threatening disease, and it was not looking good.\nI had never been\
  \ to a Zambian hospital. I did not know what to expect when I walked into his room\
  \ but I definitely was not prepared for what I saw. There were no mosquito screens\
  \ on the open windows, the air conditioning did not work, and the one fan was blowing\
  \ hot air. The small bed in front of me was holding a skinny, sweaty, sleeping body\
  \ wearing nothing but a diaper and a blanket to cover it. Henry\u2019s mother was\
  \ in a chair next to him looking exhausted and scared. She woke her sick child but\
  \ he was unable to sit up to say hello. He was breathing heavily despite the oxygen\
  \ tank he was hooked up to, his lips had sores on the insides, and his fever was\
  \ over 100 degrees. Fifteen injections were needed to save his life. His family\
  \ could afford three of them. After giving them money to pay for the rest, I promised\
  \ to come back the next day. Tears stung my eyes as I walked back into the sticky\
  \ November heat. \nThroughout the week, Henry had good days and he had bad days.\
  \ One night went smoothly but in the morning he needed a blood transfusion. Immediately.\
  \ Luckily his sister was able to donate blood to him but his body was not accepting\
  \ the new blood easily. A local friend instructed me to buy beetroot juice because\
  \ it would help his body recover. I rushed to the grocery store and bought all the\
  \ beetroot I could find. His mother, wearing the same clothes she had on since the\
  \ first day, told us that he was crying every day not because of his illness, but\
  \ because he was going to miss the trip to Victoria Falls. One week later, his lips\
  \ were starting to heal, his fever was down, he drank all the beetroot juice and\
  \ ate some Hungry Lion (the local fast food chain), and he finally smiled when he\
  \ saw me walk in the 40-bed children\u2019s ward.\nHenry was in the hospital for\
  \ nearly two weeks but was eventually healthy enough to go home. I walked by his\
  \ house to deliver the potatoes and rice he asked for and I spotted him outside\
  \ using sticks to draw in the dirt with his friends, just like any other day. \n\
  Three weeks after he was rushed to the hospital, Henry and I took a little trip.\
  \ We went to the Victoria Falls. We laughed at the baboons running past and he held\
  \ my hand tightly as we crossed a bridge that he was afraid of. The next week he\
  \ was back at Homework Club, sitting next to me and asking me for harder math problems,\
  \ as if he had never been gone."
