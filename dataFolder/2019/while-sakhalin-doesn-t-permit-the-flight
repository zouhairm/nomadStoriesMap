Text: "Can you go to the end of the Earth? Yes, I can - and farther!\nYuzhno-Sakhalinsk\
  \ shows up in my plans. A journey across the country and through eight time zones!\
  \ Could I ever have dreamt about it?\nWhile looking for tickets, I\u2019m thrilled.\
  \ Are there direct flights? I imagine Sakhalin as a little fishing village connected\
  \ with the whole world by once-a-week ship that brings food to islanders. To be\
  \ honest, a lot of inhabitants of central Russia like me believe that the Far East\
  \ is something mythical. Can one country possibly be so huge? But I have a chance\
  \ to break the stereotypes down. \nI get tickets to a direct flight from Moscow\
  \ to Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk on Boeing 777. It\u2019s time to ask: \xABPlease, Google,\
  \ tell me all about Sakhalin island before my iron bird jumps into the sky!\xBB\n\
  \xABEveryone loved it and forgot then. It stayed alone on the Earth\xBB, \u2212\
  \ says a line from a song about the island. I can\u2019t sleep during the flight\
  \ because of excitement. How is it going to be at the end of the Earth? My reward\
  \ for insomnia is the sunrise not far from the island. Imagine snow-covered hills\
  \ stretched out to the horizon welcoming the Boeing and you flying over them. It\u2019\
  s a real moment of happiness. We hit turbulence flying over the Strait of Tartary,\
  \ and then we finally land. \n\xABThere\u2019s so much space!\xBB I say when I see\
  \ Sakhalin. There aren\u2019t any buildings taller than nine floors. Only high hills\
  \ rise above the city attracting snowboarders and skiers. No, I can\u2019t sleep,\
  \ I\u2019m not tired! I left my belongings in the hotel\u2019s room and hurried\
  \ up to the ski lift. Up! There is a winter resort called \xABMountain Air\xBB here!\
  \ The sky lift carries me to the top and I start to feel fresh air smelling of the\
  \ ocean that is not far from here. I see Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk from the hill and my\
  \ heart stops beating. It seems this city grew here accidentally and became a part\
  \ of the biggest country in the world. \nIn the streets Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk isn\u2019\
  t so picturesque as from the top of the hills. It looks like one of countless Russian\
  \ residential districts with green five-floor buildings. The only beautiful building\
  \ is Sakhalin\u2019s history museum made with elements of Japanese style. In spring\
  \ tourists can enjoy the cherry blossom in the central park.\nThe streets are too\
  \ huge for small Japanese lorries made for overcrowded life of the neighbours. There\
  \ aren\u2019t big retailers or shopping malls. Just small cafes and shops with strange\
  \ names. Look! It\u2019s a Chinese restaurant where you can have lunch and not be\
  \ hungry for all the next week. What is a standard Sakhalin\u2019s lunch? Fish and\
  \ algae. It\u2019s really tasty. \nAt 6 p.m. the city becomes deserted. Shops are\
  \ closed. It\u2019s unexpected. Life here goes another way, differently from the\
  \ continent or the West (that\u2019s how locals call Moscow region). Right! Moscow\
  \ and other big cities live 24 hours a day or till the night. \nAfter 6 p.m. the\
  \ cold invades the island. I am frozen almost to death. It\u2019s clear why people\
  \ hurry up to homes! Walking in the evening is not amazing here. Just \xABMountain\
  \ Air\xBB stays alive. I look at the illuminated hills out of my hotel\u2019s window.\
  \ Skiers are tough! They are not afraid of harsh Far East climate as much as I am.\n\
  I stay at the hotel and look at the snow outside. Locals said that the ice storm\
  \ had started sometime in the evening and in the morning big trucks had to go through\
  \ snow tunnels.\nIt\u2019s time to fly away. I get exhilarated once more and decide\
  \ to come here again. \xABAeroflot\xBB calls me and says that my flight is delayed\
  \ for two hours.\n\xABIt\u2019s because of fog\xBB, a taxi driver says. \xABIt\u2019\
  s going to be a sunny day today\xBB.\nWhile Sakhalin doesn\u2019t permit the flight\
  \ the airport makes noise by voices of passages. The world doesn\u2019t exist at\
  \ this moment.\nAfter two hours the fog disappears. The taxi driver was right. Taxi\
  \ drivers always know everything.\nMoscow is waiting. I say goodbye. See you, Sakhalin\
  \ Island."
