Text: "Who could have thought that learning how to form the pizza technique using\
  \ the legs could literally save one\u2019s life? This was an eye opening fact after\
  \ my siblings and I leaped into the unknown and tried skiing for the very first\
  \ time!\n\nComing from a tropical country, we didn\u2019t have any expectations\
  \ as to what skiing really entails and if we had the skills to do it. We went to\
  \ Osaka, Japan for a family trip to let our Mom experience the winter season. Adjusting\
  \ to the subzero temperature was all we did for the first few days while we roamed\
  \ through the prefecture and and enjoyed the thrilling riders of Universal Studios\
  \ Japan. We screamed our lungs out while we rode the Hogwart\u2019s Forbidden Journey\
  \ and got lost in the magical Diagon Alley.\n\nTowards the end our vacation, we\
  \ decided to let Mom immerse in the ultimate winter experience - snow! She, along\
  \ with my other siblings, haven\u2019t seen any snow their entire lives except in\
  \ television. It was time for them to experience the bone-chilling winter wonderland\
  \ weather. Armed with down jackets, bonnets, gloves, and pure excitement, we headed\
  \ up to Hakodateyama ski resort on the last day our vacation. While my sister accompanied\
  \ Mom play and slip in the snow, me and two my siblings geared up for our much awaited\
  \ ski experience.\n\nIt turned out to be a 2-hour boot camp ski experience! Since\
  \ it was first and foremost an introduction to skiing, basic skills were taught\
  \ to beginners like us. Below were the first-timer tricks that were emphasized to\
  \ us during the training demonstration:\n\nWear proper ski outfit. Ski boots should\
  \ be the a right fit - tight and well adjusted for proper balancing. Use ski goggles\
  \ prevent snow blindness. Helmet will protect your head during skiing. Wear gloves\
  \ when carrying the skis to avoid cutting your hands.\n\n- Head skis should ALWAYS\
  \ be in front, never behind you. This would ensure the proper forward direction\
  \ of skiing.\n- Learn how to stop. The most important life-saving lesson - master\
  \ the art of pizza technique. Point the front tip of your skis together, then push\
  \ your heels out to form a wedge. This to prevent you from speeding down the hill\
  \ slope and hurt yourself. Never overlap the skis to avoid toppling forward.\n-\
  \ Learn how to fall. Yes, there is the RIGHT way to fall when skiing. If you feel\
  \ out of control and that you might crash into a tree or a person, fall sideways\
  \ nearest to your body to avoid getting hurt. Do not tense up - just fall gently\
  \ using the shoulder and hips to avoid serious injuries.\n- Learn how to get up.\
  \ The art of getting up after falling down is to sit with the skis parallel to each\
  \ to each other and stand up. Your should be in perpendicular position towards the\
  \ slope so as not to slide forward uncontrollably. Seems easy to do but it takes\
  \ a lot of muscle power in practice! After falling down several times, we were able\
  \ to master getting back up without sliding sideways or backwards.\n\nWe went to\
  \ the ski resort with zero knowledge on skiing. We left brimming with a newfound\
  \ skill and we truly bonded over countless falls and laughters. Not to brag but\
  \ skiing was a full body workout! Falling was a must and should not be taken as\
  \ a failure. Indeed, failing forward was the only way for us to finish the beginner\u2019\
  s ski lesson. Fell down 7 times, got up 8!"
