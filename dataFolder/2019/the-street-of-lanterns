Text: "I had never been somewhere so magical. It felt like walking into a Disney scene\
  \ \u2013 you know, the part in tangled where they send off all the lanterns. This\
  \ was Pittaki Street. An art initiative in Athens\u2019 Psirri district aimed to\
  \ renovate the area. Locals donated lamps, shades, Chinese lanterns and so many\
  \ other forms of light fixtures. They acted as a canopy over the street, in a fashion\
  \ that reminded me of bunting. I sadly never experienced it during the day, but\
  \ at night the atmosphere was something else.\n\nHow did I find myself here?\n\n\
  For the last few days I had been wandering Athens and decided to venture to my hostels\
  \ roof top bar for my last night. The sun was setting behind the acropolis, and\
  \ it was at this moment I realised that I had just visited the most beautiful and\
  \ fascinating city in the world.\n\nAthens was a haunt for Australians. It was their\
  \ winter, so they took to Europe for some heat - or our attempt at warmth. Sat at\
  \ my table were two lovely Aussie travellers and an interesting American, who spent\
  \ a long while insulting the English Northern accent. He claimed it sounded thick,\
  \ was hard to understand and that Northerners were rude. It is safe to say he didn\u2019\
  t hang around the table for long once I, a Northerner, started speaking.\n\nA couple\
  \ of drinks later, my two new Australian friends and I tipsily decided to leave\
  \ the bar and explore the back streets of Athens at night. In retrospect, this sounds\
  \ like a terrible idea, but had I not done this I would not have stumbled across\
  \ Pittaki Street.\n\nOur first port of call was the gelato shop. I wish I could\
  \ say in my four days in Athens that this was my first time here, but I would be\
  \ lying. This was my fourth time here, though in my defence it was really good gelato!\
  \ We took our ice-cream and began meandering through the back streets near Monastiraki\
  \ Square. \n\nThere is something about a city at night that excites me. It feels\
  \ like I am somewhere new \u2013a new atmosphere, new people and new experiences\
  \ to be had. One such experience happened to my friends and I as we turned a corner\
  \ and were welcomed by the most colourful street. No, this wasn\u2019t Pittaki Street.\
  \ It was a street full of vegetables - the floor and walls were painted red from\
  \ the splattered tomatoes. To this day I don\u2019t know what happened on that street,\
  \ but I love to imagine that there was a huge street food fight!\n\nNow, it is worth\
  \ remembering here that we were a bunch of tipsy twenty-year olds. We had no map\
  \ and no idea where we were, or how to get back to the hostel. So, we took the initiative\
  \ to follow the noise of music, laughter and happiness. This is how we stumbled\
  \ across the hidden gem of the lantern lit street. Before the initiative the street\
  \ was full of warehouses, now it is lined with alternative bars, cafes and restaurants.\
  \ The street was buzzing with tourists and locals, all having a good time.\n\nIt\
  \ was a shame that this was my last night in Athens, I would have loved to have\
  \ explored the street more. I am so curious what it would have looked like in the\
  \ daylight \u2013 but I can use this as an excuse for another trip! \n\nAt that\
  \ moment, with gelato in hand and beer on the brain, the street was completely magical.\
  \ I felt like I was in a colourful dream. A colourful, unexpected dream."
