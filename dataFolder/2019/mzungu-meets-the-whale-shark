Text: "Here I am, teetering on the edge of a dhow, great flapping flippers abound\
  \ my delicate white feet and my heart pounding in rhythm with the slapping of the\
  \ Indian Ocean against the bow.  What the hell am I doing here?  I am on Mafia Island\
  \ with my son and his friend on a great big dhow.  The ocean around me glows in\
  \ out-of-brochure azure blues and greens.  Theoretically I am in heaven.  In reality\
  \ I have simply come to visit my boy, a pilot for a local flying safari operation\
  \ who is lavishing his off days in this island paradise. \n Phrases are bouncing\
  \ off my back from all directions.  \u201CThis is a once in a lifetime experience\u201D\
  . \u201CMost folk never have the luck of swimming with a whale shark\u201D.  The\
  \ whale shark is an enigmatic ocean traveller who traverses these waters but once\
  \ a year and here you are, silly woman, teetering on the brink of a moment to treasure\
  \ forever and all you can think of is how to get back on the dhow.  You see, the\
  \ dhow is built of giant mango trees and the carpenter has but crude tools to hand.\
  \  The arithmetic is simple.  The Swahili people are nimble and I am not.  The boat\
  \ is deeply, deeply curved.  So here I stand, dithering and teetering on the edge\
  \ of a great experience and too scared to jump. I have snorkels fitted and flippers\
  \ galore.  I have witnessed the team all galloping off the edge with glee.  Tears\
  \ pour down my face mingling with the salt spray splashing up from the boat.  A\
  \ hand reaches out.  Njoo ja kuja\u2026\u2026. a smile appears, the kindest sunniest\
  \ smile I have ever witnessed.   I take his hand and we jump in together.  \nMy\
  \ knight in shining armour today is Azizi.  A member of Mafia Island Diving Company.\
  \   He came, he saw, he rescued Mama!  Azizi holds my hand tightly and we swim gently,\
  \ our legs in tandem and our flippers softly swooshing through the warm ocean water.\
  \  He smiles and smiles and smiles. I relax into the ocean and at once I am swimming\
  \ alongside the biggest creature ever.  The gentlest giant.  Silence engulfs me\
  \ \u2013 I am at one with the ocean.  Hundreds of tiny golden trevallies are nibbling\
  \ away at the unique pattern of spots on the whale shark loosening the luminescent\
  \ discs which are floating away, creating an ethereal back drift of wonderland.\
  \  \nForty Five foot of whale shark and me alongside it. A dot, although not incandescent\
  \ and floating off into the sunset.  I am struck with the vague feeling I have been\
  \ invited into this private moment.  Then I spot my son and his friend swimming\
  \ abreast of the whale shark and realise I am not alone after all.\nEach whale shark\
  \ has a pattern of spots that is unique.  A fingerprint if you will.  Scientists\
  \ study the identification of these spots using computers designed to study star\
  \ constellations.  I marvel at the thought.  How small we are, how little we know.\
  \  Right here, right now with Azizi close by I am everything I need to be. I plucked\
  \ my utmost courage and jumped and now I am at one with the whale shark.\nAzizi,\
  \ meaning treasure in Swahili, the son of another mother \u2013 plucks me from my\
  \ watery reverie back onto the dhow.  Pluck is too kindly.  Push, shove and haul.\
  \  I do not care.    I have overcome the greatest obstacle, myself.\nThe dhow chugs\
  \ back to shore. I tingle with every bump and crash.  The boys shine with life.\
  \  They are here to make the most of their time on this one big precious earth.\
  \   \nButiama Beach Hotel comes into view.  The dhow drifts into shore and we wade\
  \ in.  An ice-cold gin and tonic appears and I sip tentatively.  Palm trees sway\
  \ all around me.   The dala dala will bump and jog us the 20 minutes back to Big\
  \ Blue Lodge in Utende where we return to stay this evening.   Leaving I carry a\
  \ new seed of great accomplishment deep within myself.  The Mzungu jumped today."
