Text: The compelling true story of two beautiful 16 year-old sweethearts who meet
  when a Norwegian foreign exchange student arrives in a small town in Idaho, instead
  of his intended school in Florida.  After only a few innocent months of dating,
  the two split with heartbreak.  They never see one another again, not even on social
  media, until they both fly back to Idaho for a High School reunion. Now in their
  40's and married with grown children, they were unprepared for the intense feelings
  attraction and love that come rushing back.  Living safe and unhappy lives on opposite
  sides of the globe,  they both abandon their existences to take a leap into the
  unknown.  Each finding themselves with the freedom to travel for the first time
  in life, they arrange clandestine meetings in places the never dreamed they'd go.  First
  exploring the wilds of Norway and Viking territory, then the Mediterranean, Polynesia,
  Asia and so on.  With each trip they pack lighter, worry less and adventure more;
  skiing distant mountains, eating exotic foods, and losing themselves on tropical
  beaches. Over time they transform mentally and physically, shedding weight and stress;
  the years fall away and the hands of time reverse, unearthing their youthful minds
  and bodies.  Living and loving with abandon, they discover how much of the world
  there is to see, and how much life can be lived.
