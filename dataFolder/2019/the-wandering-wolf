Text: "This is the most unusual travel story because its about something I found in\
  \ my home city which will lead me to become a seasoned traveller.\n\nI always dreamt\
  \ of travelling the world, even maybe settling in some small corner of the world,\
  \ other than the one I have known all my life, but 5 years ago I found the most\
  \ amazing thing in the heart of Mumbai. Something that came out of oppression and\
  \ injustice, something that travelled the world and made a a home here in Mumbai.\
  \ Capoeira from Brazil was being performed on the streets of Mumbai.  I fell in\
  \ love with it, the moment I found it. \n\nCapoeiristas all from all over the world\
  \ have the tradition of travelling  to Brazil and other countries where they teach\
  \ and learn from each other. \n\nThe trip of my life would obviously be spending\
  \ a good amount of time in Brazil learning more about the history and the culture\
  \ in which capoeira came to be but also to other countries like Russia and Israel\
  \ where some of the most amazing capoeira teachers live and have their academies.\
  \ \n\nThis I think would be the perfect way to combine both my passions and finally\
  \ have a semblance of a balanced and happy life."
