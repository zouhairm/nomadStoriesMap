Text: "\"I should have practiced German before coming here.\u201D \n\nThis was the\
  \ only thought in my head when I reached Karlsruhe on a rainy Sunday night with\
  \ very few people at the \u2018hauptbahnhof\u2019. My phone had died out and now\
  \ I had started to regret my reliance on it.\n\nHaving spent all my life in a small\
  \ city in India, it was impossible for me to decipher the tram route given in German\
  \ as my city had a completely different public transport system. \n\nEven before\
  \ reaching Germany, I already had stereotypes about people here as cold, unfriendly\
  \ and formal, thanks to my friends and family.\n\nAnd here I was, all set to spend\
  \ the next 6 months as a student research Intern at a university with near to non-existent\
  \ proficiency in the German language. \n\nIn the first couple of hours, my thoughts\
  \ had started to rally towards the difficulties I was going to face in the months\
  \ to come. The nervousness and helplessness were clearly visible on my face while\
  \ my fingers were running frantically on a seemingly simple board as it had the\
  \ theory of relativity explained onto it.\n\nSuddenly, I heard a pleasing voice.\
  \ I turned and a lady in her early 50\u2019s asked me something in German. The look\
  \ on my face must have explained my inability to understand German but soon our\
  \ hands joined in the conversation and they started speaking louder than words.\n\
  \nThe smile on her face and her enthusiasm were fading my nervousness away. She\
  \ understood where I had to go and luckily, we both had to take the same tram. During\
  \ the 20 minutes that we shared the tram ride, she had asked me if I needed food\
  \ or water and had pointed out some of the nice food joints of the city which were\
  \ on our route.\n\nBefore getting off at her station, she made my life easier and\
  \ shattered the notion that I came with; \u2018Germans are cold and unfriendly\u2019\
  , right on the first day!\n\nThis lady laid down a strong foundation for me to love\
  \ Germany in the coming months which was later strengthened by my landlords, who\
  \ were a lovely couple in their late fifties. \n\nAfter getting off at my station,\
  \ I reached the apartment which I had booked through a Facebook group. The family\
  \ greeted me and showed me the apartment. For the coming months, I was going to\
  \ live with Mr. & Mrs Schreiber, who understood and spoke very little English. \n\
  \nGradually, I started picking up German words, but it was not enough to have a\
  \ fluent conversation. So, all my conversations with them were loud laughs, hands\
  \ waving in the air and saying \u2018Alles Klar\u2019, which means \u2018everything\
  \ is okay\u2019.\n\nOften they shared their favorite delicacies with me and I returned\
  \ the favour by cooking Indian food for them. \n\nBefore I knew, six months were\
  \ over and it was time for me to leave. Time flew by quickly, working, traveling,\
  \ and making memories.\n\nI now had to say goodbye to my landlords too. To show\
  \ the love and respect I had for them, I bowed down to touch their feet - the traditional\
  \ Indian way of showing respect, which I explained through a card. \n\nThe union\
  \ which started with a simple \u2018hallo\u2019, had come to an end and left us\
  \ teary. \n\nIn a matter of a few months, I had understood that a smile and hand\
  \ gestures are a great way to communicate love and warmth, that, language is not\
  \ a barrier to a welcoming heart."
