Text: "This trip had been years in the making; one of those you always talk about\
  \ but never quite seem to make happen. With the deep realization there will never\
  \ be a perfect time, together my mother and I sought out to journey in our rented\
  \ Skoda across the little island with a irrefutable reputation - Ireland.  An 11-day\
  \ journey hoping to reinvigorate us both. \n\nSomehow I managed to catch the fiercest\
  \ flu I ever had on the way to the Emerald Isle. It left me lifeless and disinterested\
  \ in the newness standing before me.  Despite it all, I did what I could as ill\
  \ as I was to make the most of it.  \n\nThe trip instilled a curiosity about this\
  \ country, particularly about why my mother named me after the Aran Islands from\
  \ her solo trip to the country at my age.  With a bit of persistence, I convinced\
  \ her to go back - a 20-odd some years later - to see the land that inspired her\
  \ in her youth. \n\nSwaying by the wicked waters that guided the ferry, I started\
  \ to question our decision to make the hike to Inis M\xF3r, the biggest of the three\
  \ Aran Islands. The sea rocked us and as we inched closer to land, I wondered why\
  \ anyone would endure this trip to get to some land secluded amidst the Atlantic.\
  \ \n\nThe pier was barren as we stepped off the boat, an eeriness ebbing through\
  \ the air. The other 100 odd some passengers quickly dispersed and began walking\
  \ inward to the island on foot as my mother and I waited for our B&B host to come\
  \ get us. Her husband arrived in his pickup, one of the few cars driven on the island.\
  \ \n\nWe soon arrived to the house with our host\u2019s spouse, St\xEDofain, guiding\
  \ us. The driveway was long and the cattle in the front yard stalked us as we approached.\
  \ Catherine, our host, stood by the door waving eagerly. Hugging us both, the smiley,\
  \ stocky woman warmly invited us in. \n\n\u201CMy sister is getting married in September!\u201D\
  \ she exclaims, motioning to the phone. \u201CWould you like some tea?\u201D \n\n\
  She rambles to her husband to get the kettle on.  As they banter in Gaelic, we sit\
  \ by the window overlooking the front of the island. I can see the waters settling\
  \ through the mist. \n\nMy mother and her begin conversing. I zone out from mere\
  \ exhaustion. After a while, I kick her from under the table hoping she takes the\
  \ hint I was in no frame of mind to entertain our host\u2019s Irish gift of the\
  \ gab. \n\n\u201CMicaela really isn\u2019t feeling well. She hasn\u2019t been all\
  \ trip actually,\u201D my mother says. \n\n\u201CPoor thing. I\u2019ll get something\
  \ special going for you.\u201D\n\nOur room is cozy and homey. I sprawl myself across\
  \ the bed and rest my eyes. My mother has become increasingly frustrated with my\
  \ ongoing lack of energy. \n\nCatherine soon returns - with a hot cup of tea in\
  \ hand. \n\n\u201CA bit of liquid courage,\u201D she says. \n\nI sipped hesitantly\
  \ knowing there may be a dash of something more than just English Breakfast. \n\n\
  We set out to cycle the island shortly after my whiskey kick.  As we begin touring\
  \ the island, the mystery of what made no sense started to unravel. \n\nFlowers\
  \ growing from rocks, the unhinged landscape allowing you to dance from stone to\
  \ stone until reaching the depths of the Atlantic. It was unlike any other place\
  \ I\u2019d seen, nor dreamed.  And the people, humbled and content with their way\
  \ of life, hidden away in their little havens, living simply and detached from the\
  \ world. Wildly different from the hustle and bustle of Galway: the island, untouched.\
  \ \n\nAfter a 2 mile cycle we approached the majestic Dun Aengus.  Unlike the famous\
  \ Cliffs of Moher, this historic cliff site had a raw, mysterious feel. The rugged\
  \ climb tested my body the entire way but each step felt like it meant more, some\
  \ sort of higher entity guiding my path.  Conquering the daunting cliffs of Aran\
  \ was cathartic. As we stood tall atop the limestone, I couldn\u2019t help but think:\
  \ I\u2019m on an island in the middle of nowhere. And I\u2019d never felt more at\
  \ home."
