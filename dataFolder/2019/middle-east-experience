Text: "I travel from riyadh to the Philippines last February 17, 2019 unexpectedly\
  \ because, my company in Riyadh is getting worst, Because, of the saudization in\
  \ the entire Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a lots of Filipino workers lost their job\
  \ in Saudi and they have no choice just to leave the country and go back to their\
  \ own native land, \n           It was the month of August last year when i decided\
  \ to file a resignation in my company, and i was really shock when i talk to one\
  \ of the staff in our office, when he told me that my company cant give me any amount\
  \ of benifits because he said our company has no money to pay my 5 years benifits\
  \ and my last salary,\n          Suddenly, i was so really mad when i heard that\
  \ words that comes from the mouth of one of the staff in our company, so i decided\
  \ to seek the help of our Philippine Labor in Riyadh, \n         Finally, after\
  \ 7 months, i recieve my travel document's from our Labor office in Riyadh, and\
  \ thanks be to God, after 7 months of hardship and trials in the middle east, i\
  \ arrive safe and sound in the Philippines.\n        Thanks to our beloved country\
  \ Philippines for helping all the distress overseas filipino, who are working in\
  \ different provinces of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."
