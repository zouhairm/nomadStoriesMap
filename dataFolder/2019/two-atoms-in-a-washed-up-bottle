Text: "Pichilemu, Chile. Halfway through January I ended up in a small hostel right\
  \ in front of the beach, cold from the ocean breeze and rubbing sand from my eyes.\
  \ Was this it? Was this the place where I was going to find myself?\nEveryone has\
  \ that one spot, the one where you fit in perfectly and feel right at home. You\
  \ wake up in the mornings and you forget that you only arrived a few days ago, clear\
  \ head and easy heart. Every step you take is a breath of fresh air and you can\
  \ go for miles before tiring. That place where you suddenly find all of the answers\
  \ to your questions. I needed my spot, or so I thought, and so I ended up here.\n\
  During the two weeks I stayed there, mopping floors and making beds and buying bread,\
  \ I thought I had found my place. Who wouldn't want to call a beachside hostel their\
  \ home? Going to sleep, lulled by the waves crashing against the shore; a beautiful\
  \ sunset every evening that painted the sky in reds and purples and pinks that almost\
  \ seemed unreal; the happiness and tranquility that only a small town can give you\
  \ in the shape of hand-painted signs and local hospitality. It was logical to think\
  \ that those things would make me happy.\nIt only took me leaving this hostel to\
  \ continue traveling that I realized that it wasn't the hostel that I was going\
  \ to miss, nor the sunsets, nor the beach, nor the town. Sure, the waves are nice,\
  \ but eventually you start to ask yourself if they're worth the mosquitoes they\
  \ bring. The sunsets are beautiful, but every sunset is beautiful no matter where\
  \ you are. And, well, the hand-painted signs were actually really pretty. But all\
  \ in all, I never expected to find out that none of these things were going to answer\
  \ my eternal questions, or tell me how to make my decisions, or make me truly happy.\
  \ \nIt turned out that some of my long awaited answers were buried in the minds\
  \ of the people around me. The other travelers that had, by some happenstance of\
  \ the universe, ended up in the same time and place as me, like two atoms crashing\
  \ together in a washed up bottle: unexpected and unforgettable. Some of my decisions\
  \ now are purely based on trivial things that I would have never thought of before.\
  \ The way I eat, the way I think, everything has changed because I started going\
  \ around this little ball of dirt and water.\nTo sum this all up, you won't find\
  \ yourself by traveling. You start off your trip with a canvas, full of expectations\
  \ and hopes, and begin piecing together parts of yourself that didn't exist before.\
  \ Some pieces are small, like deciding to never wear the color green ever again,\
  \ and some pieces are big, like getting a tattoo and going vegan. Other pieces might\
  \ be jagged on one side, like realizing you can't completely go vegan because you\
  \ love cheeseburgers. They might not all fit together at first, but eventually those\
  \ jagged edges smooth out and warp around the others and mix together and split\
  \ up and overlap until you create the epitome of all of your decisions and likes\
  \ and dislikes and thoughts and flaws and dreams. \nYou."
