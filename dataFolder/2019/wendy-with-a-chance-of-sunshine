Text: "I have been accepted to attend the World Youth Forum in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt,\
  \ and now I find myself riding a greyhound bus from Hollister, Missouri, all the\
  \ way to New York City. It happened that I got a fully funded scholarship that includes\
  \ the flight tickets, hotel and meals, but the flights depart from EgyptAir\u2019\
  s only hub in the United States, in New York. As I did not have enough money to\
  \ fly to New York, my only option to not miss that opportunity was to take a Greyhound\
  \ bus across the country.\n\tMy journey to New York became even longer after my\
  \ second bus delayed for more than four hours, which caused me to miss my next bus\
  \ transfer. As soon as I arrived in Memphis, Tennessee, I ran to the information\
  \ desk to change my tickets and catch the next bus leaving to New York. As I heard\
  \ the desk clerk typing my destination into the system, sweat beaded on my forehead\
  \ because I had a plane to catch the next day! Fortunately, the clerk put me on\
  \ the next bus leaving to Chicago in an hour, with a transfer in Cleveland before\
  \ finally making it to New York. I took a deep breath and thanked God for still\
  \ enabling me to make it to New York on time. I turned back and faced a long line\
  \ of people waiting to change their tickets because they came on the same delayed\
  \ bus too. I looked down and saw this little girl holding a folder with a sign that\
  \ stated, \u201CPLEASE HELP ME. I DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. WHAT BUS DO I NEED TO TAKE?\
  \ THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!\u201D That melted my heart, and without thinking twice,\
  \ I spoke to her dad in Spanish. I approached that young man in hopes that my language\
  \ abilities would help. He introduced himself as Zachariah, from Guatemala. By coincidence,\
  \ they also meant to go to New York, so I changed their tickets and put them on\
  \ the same bus that I would take. Happy to have helped Zachariah and his daughter,\
  \ I turned around one more time to realize that more than half of the people in\
  \ line were Latinos who spoke no English, and as they spotted me helping that little\
  \ girl and her dad, they approached me in haste and asked for help because they\
  \ also needed to change their tickets. I learned that most of those Latinos crossed\
  \ the border on foot. They had legal documents but did not have enough money to\
  \ fly to their destinations, so traveling by Greyhound was their last resort. \n\
  \tIt turns out that seven of the Latinos caught the same bus with me all the way\
  \ to New York: the two Guatemalans and five Cubans. On our way to Chicago, I took\
  \ a quick nap and woke up by feeling somebody poking me from the back seat: it was\
  \ the little Guatemalan girl. Her dad slept, so I had a little interaction with\
  \ her and asked her name in Spanish. \u201CMy name is Wendy,\u201D she smiled. Because\
  \ the buses made several short stops along the way, I noticed that everybody left\
  \ the bus for a snack or at least for a simple stretch, but the Guatemalans always\
  \ stayed on the bus. I asked Zachariah if he had anything to eat. He looked down\
  \ and shook his head, \"No.\" I opened my backpack and shared some snacks with them.\
  \ I asked more about his life and the reasons for leaving Guatemala, and I learned\
  \ that he had two uncles and one brother waiting for him in New York. As we arrived,\
  \ I did not leave to the airport until I made sure that his brother picked him up,\
  \ and we exchanged phone numbers. Riding a bus for one day and a half wore me out,\
  \ but at the end of all that experience, I felt overwhelmed and thanked God for\
  \ using me to help those immigrants on the way. On my way to a global peace conference,\
  \ I found the true peace left in my heart, as God used me to play a small role in\
  \ the lives of several people."
