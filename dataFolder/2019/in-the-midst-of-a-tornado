Text: "\u201C Brrrrrrrrrrrrng!\u201D I jumped to attention, quickly returning from\
  \ wherever my mind had drifted and back to my living room.  It was a sound that\
  \ carried an \u201Curgency\u201D, as if there was important news on the other end.\
  \ There I sat, studying for a medical  examination.  I was preparing to be certified\
  \ as an EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN and was preparing for a CPR class the following\
  \ day.   I loved humanitarian work and loved working in healthcare.   After working\
  \ as a volunteer Red Crosser and honing my skills I would apply for a paid position.\
  \  I was already on the volunteer registry but had yet to be assigned.  There had\
  \ been quite a few \u201Cmissions\u201D lately.  Each time I heard of a \u201Cdisaster\u201D\
  \ on the news, I would get excited hoping that I would receive that call.  The excitement\
  \ was often ephemeral, as I would later feel bad about becoming \u201Cexcited\u201D\
  \ over others misfortune! However I was soon to find out that most \u201Cdisaster\
  \ junkies\u201D were this way! When others ran AWAY from disasters, we ran TOWARDS\
  \ it, and this excitement we felt was the fuel that we needed to override what should\
  \ have normally frightened us as well.  I was hoping to one day soon join my \u201C\
  fellow Red-crossers\u201D in flying across the country, rendering \u201CRed Cross\u201D\
  \ care to victims of disasters. I didnt know why i maintained a land-line.  Most\
  \ people called me on my cellular phone as 90% of the world was already \u201Cdigital\u201D\
  . Its ring was always a reminder of a time passed by. I believe it was a comfort,\
  \ a sort of \u201Cunchanging\u201D staple in an ever-changing world. As I picked\
  \ up the phone I somehow knew that my life would never be the same.\n\u2018\u2019\
  Good morning how are you\u201D? It was Dorothy Jenkins, the area coordinator for\
  \ Red Cross.  \u201CFirst of all  let me start by apologizing that its taken me\
  \ so long to get back to you.  Our administrative staff had to make sure that your\
  \ background was clear before we could grant you any assignments\u201D.  I shook\
  \ my head.  As a person of African descent I was accustomed to authorities \u201C\
  making sure\u201D i was not a criminal or thug prior to granting me a position.\
  \  \n\u2018\u2019 O noooo its nooooooo problem\u201D, dragging the \u201CNo\u2019\
  s\u201D out! I was waiting patiently\u201D.\nHer voice suddenly shifted to a graver\
  \ tone. \u201CMarcus I\u2019ll be honest.  I doubted whether or not I should put\
  \ you on a mission this serious as a newbie.  But I know youre intelligent and we\
  \ need competent medical staff. There was an  tornado that struck outside of Fayetteville,\
  \ North Carolina. The authorities are searching for missing people, and the Weather\
  \ Service is saying there maybe more tornadoes. Can you be ready to deploy within\
  \ 48 hours\u201D? I agreed.  The rest of the call was administrative details.  I\
  \ was not listening.  I knew she would email the particulars and I was much too\
  \ excited! I was about to be dropped into the middle of a tornado! \nTwo days later\
  \ after completing my CPR class, and a detailed briefing, I was flying over North\
  \ Carolina.  As the clouds parted, and the plane lowered, the sight that met my\
  \ eyes nearly made my heart standstill.  We were greeted by  drivers and taken to\
  \ the local headquarters to meet the governor and officials. The entire town had\
  \ a dismal spirit over it and the air was very \u201Csticky\u201D. It looked like\
  \ a \u201Cthird world\u201D country. This did not resemble America! Entire walls\
  \ of houses had been tossed aside like toys.  Whole trees were uplifted by the roots!\
  \ I saw pieces of twisted metal wrapped around poles like tinfoil skirts! The most\
  \ amazing aspect of  a tornado is the amazing \u201Cexactness\u201D it has.  One\
  \ home can be entirely obliterated while the one right by it may  sustain only minor\
  \ landscape damage.  It is no wonder that tornadoes have been called \u201CThe finger\
  \ of God\u201D as there is often very little rhyme or reason to their destructive\
  \ meanderings.  We were  briefed again and then headed to \u201Cthe field\u201D\
  .  I knew with every fiber of my being that I had taken \u201Da leap into the unknown\u201D\
  \  and would never be the same."
