Text: "My first trip to europe wasnt planned to visit places, instead, I wanted it\
  \ to know the way pleople live, dress, dance, get along with the others and to see\
  \ the way they drink coffee. \nCzech Republic keeps a lot of secrets for the people\
  \ who wants to discover them. \nAfter have done a real research about local coffee\
  \ bars, the first place I visited when i get in Prague was Caf\xE9 Savoy, the one\
  \ that is placed in the opposite site of the dancing house, the fact is that one\
  \ year later, it received a Michelin star. \nPrague also has this PopoCaf\xE9Petl,\
  \ it has nothing to do with mexican/aztec culture, but it\u2019s funny to find this\
  \ mix of words in a totally different place. \nThe last thing I want to describe\
  \ about what I found there was that here was the first place where I ordered a Gin\
  \ Tonic and also a raspberry tart, why? Don\u2019t ask, I just followed the saying\
  \ \u201Cwherever you go, do what you see\u201D.\nTRY SCHNITZEL in the farthest place\
  \ from downtown!! It is way different and delicious. \n\nAfter discovering what\
  \ Prague had for me I went to Berno, the biggest city of Czech Republic just after\
  \ Prague, it is way pure, not so full of tourists and Momenta Caf\xE9, the one that\
  \ has sugar in an ice cream form; dark and white sugar. \n\nI think that you don\u2019\
  t have to go to an specific place to find yourself, what I have discovered is that\
  \ you get to know yourself with each moment you live."
