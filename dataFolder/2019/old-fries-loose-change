Text: "I am in Romania because of a postage stamp on a lampshade. It\u2019s a true\
  \ story. \n\nIt was Christmas Eve and I was determined to spend it anywhere else\
  \ but \u201Chome\u201D. I met my friend at the pub who helped me write random destinations\
  \ on a torn up menu when I noticed the lampshade at the end of the bar with postage\
  \ stamps glued to it. The stamps all said Romania. I booked a ticket to leave the\
  \ following day. \n\nIt\u2019s colder here than in Pennsylvania, where I am from,\
  \ but it\u2019s ironic to me that I am in another \u201CVania\u201D \u2026Transylvania.\
  \ There is a stoicness of the people here. The people look hard and challenged.\
  \ I feel like I fit in for some reason, and for another, not at all. I am eager\
  \ to get on this train which will take me through the Carpathian mountains so I\
  \ can challenge a garlic myth. I am scanning the interior of the woods hoping to\
  \ spot a bear or a werewolf. \n\nThe further north we go, the more I realize I was\
  \ crazy to do this. I do not speak the language. I do not know the customs, or even\
  \ the layout of the land. I briefly begin to panic at my own adventurous spirit\
  \ but I am interrupted by the train stopping.\n\LWe pull into the station of a little\
  \ town. The railings are green and the hanging pots are red. They are covered in\
  \ snow. There are five people on the platform. We are now paused, nestled inside\
  \ the Carpathian Mountains, it is snowing lightly and it looks like a fairytale\
  \ land. It FEELS like a fairytale land. I am sent off to wistful story in my own\
  \ mind where I am dressed as witch, performing a ceremony to leave all negativity\
  \ behind. Romania can handle it, I tell myself. It\u2019s a dark spirit here and\
  \ we\u2019re transmuting energy at the caldron...\n\nI am jolted back to reality\
  \ as another train goes by outside the window. My reflection appears and disappears\
  \ in the glass between the passing trains. I am thinking\u2026this is life\u2026\
  all the layers. Passing one over the other, revealing the self a little differently\
  \ against the changing background. The only thing we all really share is the speed\
  \ of which time passes. We are all present for that.\n\nIn a few minutes I will\
  \ see that caboose pass my window and I will be looking at that same platform, now\
  \ without people. I will be looking out my window and still see my own reflection\
  \ in the glass. I will continue to pass through the mountains until I reach my next\
  \ stop. When I get there, I will take only what I have in my little backpack and\
  \ walk towards cobblestone streets into another vortex of life. In Sibiu, I will\
  \ exchange glances with strangers that will never become my friends. I will share\
  \ seats, rides, language barriers and frustrations with them but we will never know\
  \ each other past that moment. \n\nIn Brasov, I will make a promise to myself, one\
  \ I will not tell anyone. One I will keep among the bits of life I have lost between\
  \ seats of car rentals I returned. They lie there between the bottomless pits of\
  \ places unreachable by hand or vacuum, next to old French fries and lose change.\
  \ And right there, in Bucharest, a piece of me crumbles off while walking down a\
  \ dirt road. I can\u2019t tell the difference between myself and the terrain. I\
  \ am disappearing or perhaps reinventing.\_\n\nI am only halfway through this country,\
  \ the country of Romania, the country of self. Mountains will not move until I go\
  \ further. Over, or under. I am aware. My memory is hinged to another destination\
  \ on this earth. Living in this moment of life where I am here but feel as if I\
  \ am in some other dimension of time and space with some unknown force propelling\
  \ me forward and forcing the lead. I watch my shoes hit the pavement and think about\
  \ every time they have gifted me the chance to be somewhere else but instead brought\
  \ me right where I am."
