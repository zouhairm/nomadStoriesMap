Text: "My breath becomes shallow as I trudge up the Chisos Mountains in West Texas,\
  \ my 65-Liter backpack\u2019s shoulder straps pulling me backwards and constricting\
  \ my chest. I gasp for air with a dry mouth that tastes like chemicals from the\
  \ SPF lip balm I\u2019m wearing. I feel the panic rise as I struggle to breathe\
  \ deeply. \u201CDon\u2019t hyperventilate, don\u2019t hyperventilate\u201D I repeat\
  \ to myself, fearing embarrassment in front of my nine mentally and physically capable\
  \ backpacking companions. We\u2019d been hiking steadily uphill all day and my body\
  \ was not pleased. \n\nThis was my first time backpacking, but I wasn\u2019t on\
  \ a beginner-level course. As an employee of my local Outward Bound school, I joined\
  \ colleagues from around the country on a 7-day staff expedition in Big Bend National\
  \ Park. The unique desert environment appealed to me, not to mention a fully paid\
  \ trip. Soon enough, I found out my spin classes had not prepared me adequately\
  \ for this challenge. \n\nI visited at a pivotal time. Part of the borderland between\
  \ the US and Mexico, West Texas has a long history of border disputes and cultural\
  \ mingling. Now, with a presidential call to erect a border wall and anti-migrant\
  \ rhetoric, West Texas is in the middle of the controversy. Shortly after my backpacking\
  \ trip ended, President Trump held a rally in El Paso, a city where 83% of residents\
  \ are Mexican, and was met with both support and protests. \n\nI continue the slow,\
  \ uphill struggle. \u201COne foot after the other,\u201D I tell myself. I roll my\
  \ ankle from a wrong step on a loose rock. I\u2019m careful to avoid razor sharp\
  \ prickly pear spines and the ocotillo\u2019s tall, spiky branches that pop up out\
  \ of nowhere when I remove my gaze from the ground to look ahead. The group finally\
  \ calls red light for a 15-minute packs-off break. I wrestle my backpack off and\
  \ drop onto it, using it as a seat. My breath becomes steady again and I look around\
  \ me at the vast scenery. \n\nEndless fields of prickly pears, ocotillos, chollas,\
  \ and other desert plants surround us. The roots of the stiff, green creosote bushes\
  \ clear paths among the various types of cacti, providing mostly safe passage for\
  \ desert creatures and visitors like us. Over all of this tower mountains, their\
  \ jagged edges and flat mesas etching out their place in the skyline. \n\nAs I inhale\
  \ the dry desert air and savor the cool breeze, I see a rusty can along the trail.\
  \ It could have easily been discarded thoughtlessly by another hiker. But in this\
  \ land, it was just as likely to have been from a migrant risking their life in\
  \ the wilderness to find economic opportunity and freedom from systemic violence.\
  \ I endured the harsh West Texas desert to travel and gain a new, unfamiliar experience.\
  \ Just on the other side of those mountains, migrants step into the unfamiliar every\
  \ day for entirely different reasons. \n\n15 minutes is up. I finally manage to\
  \ put my backpack on without help, hoisting it onto my knee and twisting it around\
  \ to my back in one heavy swoop. We continue our uphill climb, nothing on my mind\
  \ except my physical discomfort and the thought of what it would be like to make\
  \ this same trek without knowing what awaited me at the end."
