Text: "Standing on the boarders edge between Spain and Morocco... is rather interesting\
  \ sight to see. The hustle and bustle of daily life, a mixture of smells filling\
  \ the air, some familiar others I am yet to discover. \nAs I take a leap into the\
  \ unknown, my passport in hand, I follow the signs painted on the walls in both\
  \ Spanish and Arabic. Leaving Ceuta behind me whilst my Moroccan adventure awaits.\
  \ \nOnce on the other side it\u2019s clear I am no longer in Europe. Official tour\
  \ guides calling out for attention, people carrying their daily imports ready to\
  \ sell the following day. Line of bright blue Mercedes taxis await... admittedly\
  \ these vehicles have seen better days but it\u2019s all part of the adventure.\
  \ \nOnce in the taxi, a quick stop at my hotel is my first plan of action. As we\
  \ drive through the long dusty boarder town... sun shining, spices filling the air.\
  \ It\u2019s evident there\u2019s lots to explore, the unfamiliar atmosphere only\
  \ adds to my excitement. \nAfter speaking to the taxi driver in between a mixture\
  \ of broken English and Spanish it was decided he\u2019d be my local tour guide\
  \ for the day. \nMaking a stop in Marina Smir there\u2019s a noticble European influence\
  \ with the surrounding shops, layout of the marina. For a moment you would think\
  \ you are in a Spanish port until you turn to look at the architecture of the buildings\
  \ beind me. Detailed arches, intricate mosaic designs of white washed buildings\
  \ takes your breath away. \nMoving out of the marina and making our way to tetouan\
  \ is an interesting journey. Passing luxury villa after villa, kings residenc followed\
  \ by hotel after hotel. The pathways are spotless, gardens well maintained and the\
  \ area contntoled by varios royal guards is a far cry from the dusty, dirty border\
  \ town. \nAfter 35 mins we arrive at our destination... tetouan soq. My senses are\
  \ tingling, itching to get out into the busy streets, waiting to try some of the\
  \ delights that are filling the air. \nWalking into the market area is like taking\
  \ a step back in time. Cobbled streets leading to all the different quarters of\
  \ the market. Walking through mazes of what seems to be tunnels leading off to little\
  \ side streets full of artisans selling their wares. Bakers baking in old brick\
  \ style ovens. Fire pits filled with what looks like Cast iron food canisters being\
  \ bright to them one at a time with the ingredients inside ready for cooking. Spices\
  \ filling the air. Oranges and melons, nut stalls filling the streets. Breathtakingly\
  \ refreshing yet gruiling for the works. Seeing their faces with huge smiles yet\
  \ a sadness within their eyes, lines on their faces and working hands. You can tell\
  \ life isn\u2019t easy but happy they are. Passing a large number of stall after\
  \ stall of imitation designer goods, tourists having a filed day at the cost. Shopping\
  \ bag after shopping bag piled up around them. It\u2019s amusig yet disheartening\
  \ at the same time. \nComing to the tannery the smell is almost unbearable, mixture\
  \ between stagnant water and wet animals. It\u2019s enoguh to make you faint with\
  \ the airless heat surrounding us. Walking into the tannery, being able to see the\
  \ whole open air process is something I have never seen before. I can only describe\
  \ as a colourful array of concrete tubs. Watching the wool being dipped into each\
  \ one dependent on the colour or treatment, moving forward to the drying area and\
  \ out the other side. My eyes are open... trying to take in everything at once,\
  \ staring on in amazment at an age old tradition taking place right in front of\
  \ me is poetic. \nMoving on through to the old castle walls I come across what at\
  \ first looks like a hole in the wall. Peeking in there\u2019s a huge pot ontop\
  \ of and open fire. One table and two chairs. Smell of food filling the air makes\
  \ my mouth water, I have no choice but to sit, stop and eat. I\u2019m served with\
  \ a bowl of what looks like a mustard coloured chicken dish and a flat bread. Using\
  \ the bread as cutlery enjoying local delights."
