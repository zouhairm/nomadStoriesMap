Text: "Our tour bus pierced through the dark forest on an unusually warm, Wiltshire\
  \ morning. I was an Atlantic Ocean away from the origins of this trip idea. When\
  \ I first set out to travel to Stonehenge, I thought getting close could get me\
  \ further away from him.\n\nBy him, I mean the person who put those ancient, enchanting\
  \ rocks on my map. The curiosity he ignited in me turned into a seed that managed\
  \ to weather through our breakup and sprout at the opportunity of paying the historic\
  \ site a visit during my first time away in the UK. For decades, my ex dreamed of\
  \ visiting Stonehenge on a Solstice. His enthusiasm was so infectious, I started\
  \ dreaming too. Trouble was, my dream did not account for a journey of one. \n\n\
  The headlights dimmed as our bus engine came to a halt. About thirty people stepped\
  \ out into the darkness. From there, it was by shuttle or by foot. I chose the latter,\
  \ discovering that there was no better way to begin a pilgrimage to an ancient holy\
  \ site, than to walk in the dark hours before dawn in a procession with perfect\
  \ strangers. No electric light or electric wheels; just people following people.\
  \ \n\nWhen those iconic stones first appeared in the horizon, a chill swept through\
  \ my body. The distance between imagination and reality dissolved like the last\
  \ layers of darkness around me. The details of the windswept meadows, the sound\
  \ of footprints on the road, and the hushed chatter nearby, suddenly filled my senses.\
  \ I was waking up. \n\nWe arrived at Stonehenge just before the crack of dawn, where\
  \ already, hundreds of people from near and far, gathered. I did not know where\
  \ to be exactly, except somewhere inside the inner circle. A bearded man in a hooded\
  \ cloak, raised his hands and led the group to join him in thanking the four cardinal\
  \ directions. As soon as our brief attention was released, it felt like a celebration\
  \ had officially begun. \n\nThere was no formal agenda. Each had their own way of\
  \ preparing for the gradual sunrise. Several performed wiccan or pagan rituals.\
  \ Some played drums, with eyes closed and shoulders swaying in rhythm. Some went\
  \ barefoot to feel the cool earth beneath. A few meditated. One man formed a small\
  \ circle of linked hands and sang. Most looked to the horizon with excited anticipation,\
  \ like they\u2019ve never seen the sun before. \n\nThe first sunrise of Winter was\
  \ beautiful, just like every sunrise before it. The crowd, having grown to thousands\
  \ by that point, gradually shuffled beyond the inner circle. More drums, more dancing,\
  \ more photos, more costumes. Sage burned at every corner. The circle of linked\
  \ hands with the singing man grew larger. A choir, dressed in red and made of mostly\
  \ women, took to the inner circle and sang. A Welsh pagan offered me some Jack Daniels\
  \ with a genuine smile of some missing teeth (I kindly declined). In the distance,\
  \ a group of climate change activists foretold that only twelve Solstices remained.\
  \ \u201CAre we going to enjoy this as a celebration, or are we going to act?\u201D\
  \ The protester\u2019s voice faded, replaced by continuing drum beats and the giggling\
  \ squeals of nearby children, rolling in the grass.\n\nWhat remains of Stonehenge\
  \ is a ring of large, uneven shaped stones of unknown origins, debated to this day.\
  \ Empty or filled, it stands as a sacred meeting place welcoming any to its \u2018\
  doors\u2019 on all sides, regardless of where one came from and what they bore in\
  \ their hearts. \n\nSince the breakup, I ventured into the terra incognita of my\
  \ emotions and unexpectedly came out into the crowded, sunlit center of Stonehenge\
  \ on the shortest day of the year. Until that visit, I held onto my ex\u2019s dream\
  \ as if it was one of the last things of his that I owned. But neither he nor I\
  \ owned those stones. No one did. Stonehenge belonged to anyone. \n\nMy enchantment\
  \ broken like most of its stones, Stonehenge\u2019s real magic remained intact with\
  \ me. I found peace in my ex\u2019s absence among its ruins there, and finally,\
  \ the perfect resting place for my restless heart."
