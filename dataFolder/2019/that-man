Text: There is loneliness road,and getting dark as time passes,I don't know is it
  good to be alone or whatever I am just feeling free .these road , mountain,cold
  breeze and the famous Mall road.I am peace , afterall I quit my job and this is
  my retirement .I have always plan this trip when I am at my 20s with a girl whom
  I love but then my family doesn't want us together,and after some time we get married
  separately,and engaged in our responsibility,we never have conversation with eachother
  again,but we lived in a same village so I still ask about her from my former friend
  who is his neighbour.its been 10 years she shifted here ,the beautiful city like
  her "Shimla" it's beautiful like small heaven, it's been quite ,like all the Chaos
  from city have been lost somewhere,so you guys know m suffering last stage of cancer
  still somehow feeling alive today seeing flag of our country in d middle or going
  churches,you should know before coming here I am a big atheist but something happen
  when I listen morning bell ,I couldn't stop  wondering about this thing like it
  calling me like it was saying her name again again ,so I went up and visit it.this
  church was inside the military camp but extremely beautiful, I visit that place
  ask priest how to do prayer and close my eyes for a second and there she is much
  young and as beautiful as these sky here ,she is perfect,so I go to her with my
  stumbled feet"Gurpreet" I called, she turn back,like time was stop everything stop
  only my heartbeat was der ,and it was beating fast,who are you?? She ask. Suddenly
  I realise she is much younger but still happy this kind of resembles means she is
  her daughter may be I get to see her before I die,' you are her daughter isn't?
  I asked, yes!! But who are you and how could you know my maa? I don't have answers
  What happen if I say my name ,what will she think about me after all these year
  why I came?  I am Jagdish,I am from same village from you mother's? I say after
  some  thinking, "Jagdish, Jagdish Mathur, ? She ask with tears in her  eye, Yes
  I replied, she take me to the train station in Shimla which is famous because of
  toy train ,she took me for the ride and told me little story my move love to ride
  these train and always book two seat one for you and other for herself ,she died
  last year due to Alzheimer's,and in her last day only word she remember is you ,she
  loved you always.so I travel these train daily with two seats,she is with me,as
  his story complete he looked at me with little smile on his face. I saw is face
  one more time ,he is old but he know the love we people are missing, for me Shimla
  is all about the uncle with two seat
