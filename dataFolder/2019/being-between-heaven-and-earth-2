Text: 'Sometimes you get pretty close to heaven. And in the moments of being close,
  unexpected things often happen. Maybe because you are especially sensitive in those
  moments. Those who leave their comfort zone getting rewarded. Like I got it, while
  I was traveling to Nepal.


  I wanted to be close to people and culture. And didn''t expact, that I would feel
  quite close to heaven too. I was wwoofing and had been working in the fields all
  day. I was tired, but also fulfilled with joy. To let the day end, I looked for
  a quiet, inspiring place in nature to spend a few more minutes with myself. I stood
  on a mountain, could look far in all directions and watched the sun setting in the
  west behind the high mountains of the Himalayas. And then, unexpectedly, I experienced
  a profoundly formative moment: While on one side the sun disappeared more and more,
  the day went and the night came, the full, round moon appeared exactly opposite
  in the same speed. It was like a scale - the weight of the sun allowed the moon
  to rise. At that moment I had the feeling that the world was making itself clear
  to me. No lesson is as instructive as one''s own seeing and understanding.


  Perhaps one is particularly receptive to the great wonders, to the beauty of nature
  and the world, while travelling. As a traveller, I am always a learner,  a discoverer,
  a recognizer. More than ever.'
