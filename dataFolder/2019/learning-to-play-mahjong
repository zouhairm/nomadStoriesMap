Text: "I received a nice severance package from work and paid for a three-week group\
  \ tour around China, Tibet, and Hong Kong for me and my mom. On this specific tour\
  \ our stops included Beijing, two places of the Great Wall, Xi\u2019an, Yangtze\
  \ River cruise, Chengdu to see the panda reserve, Lhasa, and Hong Kong. Our tour\
  \ had numerous outings including meeting with local people along with some free\
  \ time.\n\nWhenever I travel, I always like to learn some words in the language\
  \ or at least at the very minimum hello, thank you and sometimes curse words and\
  \ how to say cheers. I was trying to learn some Mandarin for our upcoming trip.\
  \ In one of my classes I learned a saying called \u201Cma-ma, hu-hu\u201D which\
  \ translates into \u201Cso-so\u201D but whenever someone who knew enough English\
  \ would ask me words I knew I would say \u201Cni hao,\u201D \u201Cni hao ma,\u201D\
  \ \u201Cxie xie,\u201D and \u201Cma-ma hu-hu\u201D \u2013 which usually solicited\
  \ laughter since it\u2019s not a phrase most people are taught. I still remember\
  \ this phrase because I was born in the year of the tiger \u2018hu\u2019 and my\
  \ brother was born in the year of the horse \u2018ma\u2019.  \n\nDuring on organized\
  \ tour outing in Beijing, we were able to go through the hutong areas and I kept\
  \ seeing groups of people on these \u2018lawns\u2019 who were playing this game.\
  \ At one point in time, I asked our tour guide, \u201CMaggie,\u201D what it was\
  \ and she explained it was mahjong. Little did I know I would soon learn how to\
  \ play it.\n\nFast forward to Xi\u2019an, and our group was touring one of the local\
  \ herbal market, which all kinds of dried plants and some lizards and snakes for\
  \ whatever may ail the customers. While looking around the stalls, I saw a group\
  \ of four people sitting at a table playing a game along with other vendors and\
  \ customers gathered around. I went in for a closer look and indicated if it was\
  \ okay to take a photo of the game. Not only was it okay, but all of a sudden one\
  \ of the people sat me down and started to show me what I needed to do. Thankfully\
  \ another person in my tour group spoke Mandarin and knew how to play mahjong, so\
  \ between the two of them I was getting a crash course. All of a sudden there were\
  \ an additional 20 people around us watching me try to figure out the game. Unfortunately\
  \ we had only about 30 minutes but I was hooked. \n\nAfter Xi\u2019an, our group\
  \ went on a boat cruise on the Yangtze River from Wuhan to Chonqing. During the\
  \ evenings, Maggie taught me more intricacies of mahjong. On our third evening,\
  \ we had a chance to play an unknown business person and make some wagers since\
  \ it was \u2018legal\u2019 to gamble on the boat. He never had a chance between\
  \ the two of us \u2013  Maggie as a mahjong shark and me with beginner\u2019s luck.\
  \ I won a total of 80 Yuan (equivalent of $8 USD). It was a fun night and I probably\
  \ heard some good curse words from him, but don\u2019t remember them to this today.\n\
  \nOn the last portion of our trip, we went to the Hong Kong Night Market and of\
  \ course I had to buy a mahjong set. It moved around with me for a few years, but\
  \ then I donated it from when I moved to Chicago to the Denver area. I miss playing\
  \ it and am now trying to find some people in my community who play it on a regular\
  \ basis either in the evening time or on the weekends. Anytime I see the word mahjong,\
  \ or the game played, I remember with fond memories and all the other local connections\
  \ that were made on that amazing trip."
