Text: "My friends used to make it snappy in their daily life but I could not follow\
  \ their strict programs. I learnt how to spare time and be flexible, after traveling\
  \ into the nature of Chitwan, the subtropical southern part of Nepal. Chitwan National\
  \ Park, the richest natural area in the Terai, too humid during the midsummer, is\
  \ the strongest experience to go through if your versatile mind disobeys time. Find\
  \ out why the Nepalese jungle of 544 species of birds, home of one horned rhinoceros\
  \ and Gharial crocodiles, is the best shrink for stressed Europeans and Americans\
  \ who complain about not finding any free time in their life.\n\u2022\tHigh Sal\
  \ and Cotton Silk trees are so sculpturally beautiful that you stop looking at your\
  \ watch.\nIt is true that if you stop looking at your watch, time matters in a different\
  \ way for you. Tropical jungle of Nepal encouraged me to look high, observe more\
  \ and, thus, think more, in an abstract way. Even if nothing seemed to move around\
  \ for some minutes, while walking silently with an expert local guide, this natural\
  \ all green environment influenced my mood. I relaxed and learnt the importance\
  \ of being a good seeker of both nature life and life values generally. No more\
  \ big suitcases; just the necessary clothes to wear day by day, as the proper trip\
  \ counts more than one\u2019s appearance. Out of the blue, the jungle flora had\
  \ touched me. \n\u2022\tBirdwatching during the canoe trip in Rapti river of Chitwan\
  \ takes place when people don\u2019t chatter.\nThere is a huge variety of Asian\
  \ birds, the kingfisher of which is the most delicate. However, birds express themselves\
  \ when people are silent during their canoe trip in Rapti river. Quiet atmosphere\
  \ means freedom and safety for the birds. After coming back home, thinking on birds\u2019\
  \ melody, I decided to chatter less and avoid useless talks. Apparently, I spared\
  \ a lot of time with this attitude obeying the rule that less is more.\n\u2022\t\
  Local people work a lot but they still smile.\nApart from its fauna and flora, Nepalese\
  \ jungle is supported by local people, guides, trainers and security services. It\
  \ was a lesson for me to see local Nepalese people work a lot, even ten hours a\
  \ day, but still with a smile on their face. I also adopted their smiley look after\
  \ coming back, which protected me somehow from evaluating everything, even minor\
  \ things, in a negative way. So, now, I know how to spare time and build a personality\
  \ wall every time someone says something bad to me. I just move on to my next duty\
  \ with a Buddhist smile.\n\u2022\tChitwan flirt includes bicycle culture.\nIn the\
  \ jungle of Chitwan, local teenagers get to know each other by simple questions\
  \ about bicycles. It is not common to know someone, either man or woman, who doesn\u2019\
  t ride the bicycle over there. Then, after my trip to Nepal, I started walking more,\
  \ moving my body instead of taking the bus or the metro for just one or two stops.\
  \ I found some way to spare pocket money and, to balance time again, I cut off unnecessary\
  \ visits downtown.\n\u2022\tInternet matters but your body is physical and not digital.\n\
  In the midsummer, Chitwan jungle with all the natural sounds and animals living\
  \ there, is the most humid place to return to your body and its needs for a cold\
  \ shower. In Chitwan, where Wi-Fi comes and goes easily, I realized that technology\
  \ is not everything. It is more important to see rhinos and crocodiles, any bird\
  \ and baby or spotted deer than to stick to the mobile screen and Facebook. After\
  \ my natural experience, I stopped being close to screens, I reduced messages and\
  \ I spared time. I decided to call my friends in case I miss them and their voice\
  \ instead of emailing them.     \nTo sum up, this is not an article to show you\
  \ any mistake. This is a proposal to attain better living because time winners are\
  \ supposed to wait wonders. In the jungle, I didn\u2019t expect to find the best\
  \ time management lesson ever."
