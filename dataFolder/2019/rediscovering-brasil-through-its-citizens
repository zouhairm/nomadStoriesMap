Text: "Few Brazilians have been around Brazil. Visiting the 27 states is something\
  \ that doesn't t fit into a holiday itinerary and  it is expensive. The distance\
  \ is like travelling between countries and the expensive plain tickets creates a\
  \ situation that only the richest people can do it. Three years ago, my job gave\
  \ me the opportunity to travel around Brazil telling stories of Brazilians who were\
  \ chosen to run with the Olympic torch. As a journalist, my mission was to tell\
  \ 14 stories all by myself, with a camera and a computer. \n\nMission accepted,\
  \ I traveled almost three months through Brazil. Were more than 30 thousand kilometers\
  \ by land and air to understand the mystique of the Olympic flame and what it causes\
  \ into people and places where it goes. During this project, I interviewed 14 people\
  \ and among them I can choose somes highlights. \n\nIn the Midwest, I met a 70-year-old\
  \ triathlete who, decades ago, ran away from an abusive relationship and found in\
  \ sport a new chance to be who she truly was. In the north, I sailed for more than\
  \ 5 hours along Amazonian rivers to meet an indigenous athlete and his village.\
  \ There, after a few hours of interview, his mother made us a cupua\xE7u juice (typical\
  \ fruit), harvested at that time. In the south, I met an athlete who gave up the\
  \ Olympic dream to donate a kidney to his sister, after being the only compatible\
  \ donor. In the Southeast, a woman world basketball champion at age 70, who dedicates\
  \ her life teaching children the value of sport. In the northeast, a photographer\
  \ who has climbed the highest peak in the state to get to know him better and tells\
  \ the story of his people along the road.\n\nAll these stories we broadcasted in\
  \ the pre-olympic period the main sports channel in Brazil, where I currently work.\
  \ It was the most challenging and pleasent job I've ever done. In the end, there\
  \ were so many stories, so many lessons that there is no trip out of my country\
  \ that has impressed me more than this. Brazilian people are cheerful, solidary\
  \ and hardworking. They have so many dreams. Brazil is so big that I could only\
  \ complete the entire map by adding the other trips I have already done. Today,\
  \ I am proud to say that I have been in all the states of Brazil. This experience\
  \ is so important to me that I have the map of Brazil tattooed on my right arm.\
  \ I have known a little bit of our diverse culture, accents, foods and drinks and\
  \ I could be sure that here, despite all the problems, is the best place in the\
  \ world to live."
