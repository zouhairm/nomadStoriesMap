Text: "Leaving the refugee town of Barahle, navigating the desolate rocky landscape\
  \ I was glad of the plucky Toyota Land Cruiser that had safely transported us across\
  \ the remote and adverse terrain of northern Ethiopia that morning. I was also glad\
  \ of Security, in the form of Barahle\u2019s stern-looking Chief of Police, who\
  \ would be accompanying this part of my expedition although I was none too comfortable\
  \ with the business end of his revolver that poked me painfully in the ribs at every\
  \ jolt. \n\nIt was a relief to be on our way after the animated negotiations with\
  \ the town officials, which involved wads of 50 Birr notes and bunches of khat being\
  \ handed over by my guide Kato to ensure safe passage. Situated on the main road\
  \ observing the discussion out of the car window I noticed a mosque to the left\
  \ and an Orthodox church to the right; a town of two halves, symbolic of the region\
  \ we were about to enter. \n\nSitting in the hot and now crowded 4x4 \u2013 an AK47-toting\
  \ Afar tribesman who would act as our \u2018scout\u2019 had also joined us making\
  \ our party seven \u2013 I wondered for a fleeting moment what I was doing entering\
  \ a hostile area, ravaged by a half century-war over the disputed boundary between\
  \ Ethiopia and Eritrea that had left tens of thousands dead. \n\nBoth country\u2019\
  s leaders had signed a peace deal a month previously and the border, shut for 20\
  \ years, was opened with great ceremony and celebration. Despite the presence of\
  \ the Chief of Police and the silent scout up front, Kato cheerfully assured me\
  \ that our visit to the Danakil Depression would be perfectly safe.  A few hours\
  \ later as we turned off the mountain road onto a dusty track to descend into the\
  \ crater of the Dallol volcano I wondered whether in this isolated region absolutely\
  \ everyone had received the memo!\n\nThe Danakil Depression is not for the faint-hearted.\
  \ Billed as the most inhospitable place on earth, it lies over 100m below sea level\
  \ and temperatures regularly top 50 degrees centigrade.  What people are drawn to\
  \ are the amazing bright yellow and green sulphur lakes nestled in the middle of\
  \ the salt flats, a sight I was looking forward to experiencing the following day.\
  \ It was late afternoon as we reached the bottom of the crater and set off across\
  \ the vast expanse towards Hamad Ela, our overnight camp. \n\nHypnotised by the\
  \ blue of the sky against the white of the salt flats I\u2019d fallen into a slight\
  \ doze when I was jolted awake by the sound of music blaring from the car speakers.\
  \ Loud music is a staple of everyday life in Ethiopia and as the music persisted\
  \ the tension in the car slowly began to dissipate as, united by the latest pop\
  \ song, our guests and I began to tap our feet and smile as Kato sang along. \n\n\
  Hamad Ela has a community of a few hundred people who work the thriving salt trade,\
  \ although when we arrived the camp looked deserted with a few traditional bed frames\
  \ dotted around and a hut that would serve as a kitchen-diner. While the crew were\
  \ unpacking the mattresses, table and chairs, cooking equipment and supplies Kato\
  \ and I wandered over to some rocks to find a \u2018natural' toilet and came across\
  \ a football game! Even at sunset the heat was still intense and watching the kids\
  \ having fun I began to realise that any hostilities we might encounter were going\
  \ to be from the environment, not the locals.\n\nAs a seasoned traveller I always\
  \ carry a pack of cards and after dinner, eager to interact with my companions I\
  \ asked Kato to invite everyone to play. Trying to communicate the rules of rummy\
  \ was a challenge but with smiles, demonstrations and some help from Kato our previous\
  \ reticence vanished and all of us, including the stern Police Chief, were soon\
  \ enjoying ourselves. \n\nSitting on the thin mattresses playing by moonlight and\
  \ our torches I reflected that there were many things that divided our little group\
  \ \u2013 religion, culture, nationality and beliefs \u2013 but at that moment we\
  \ were united by the simplest of things; shared laughter and companionship."
