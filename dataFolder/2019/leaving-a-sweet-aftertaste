Text: "\"They haven't thought about preparing for next season yet\".\n\nOur interpreter,\
  \ Mr Ock, explains in English as the smiling, middle-aged woman meets our inquisitive\
  \ gazes, watching for the acknowledging nod of our understanding. Beside her, chasm-deep\
  \ wrinkle ripples echo out from a joyous, betel-stained mouth of her grandmother,\
  \ now well into her 80's. She's never met a foreigner before. It seems she feels\
  \ honoured that we'd want to talk with her, to ask her about her life here, and\
  \ to try to understand how she survived two and a half months trapped in this home\
  \ while the flood waters lapped at the floorboards. The water didn't go into the\
  \ house this last flood, but all of the hens and some aggressive, wild snakes had!\
  \ \n\nThe younger team-members of our party appear comfortable, sitting on the slat\
  \ floor of this family's home, but I shift my weight and position, my creaking middle-class\
  \ whitewoman bones protesting against the manipulations I'm forcing upon them. 'Don't\
  \ show the soles of your feet: it's rude', I remind myself, and glance again at\
  \ the slender, lithe form of this magnificent older woman, nearly double my age...\
  \ and flexibility. She has endured such  unenviable circumstances and experiences,\
  \ yet her energetic outlook is better than my own.  \n\n\"How did you cope with\
  \ being home, alone for all that time? Were you afraid?\" Clarissa asks. \n\nMr\
  \ Ock barely hesistates in formulating the Khmer translation, and delivers it with\
  \ such a warm and engaging style that the two women subtlely turn and lean toward\
  \ him, mirroring him, then respond.\n\n\"She says she went to the high ground in\
  \ the boat once or twice, just to visit, but she came back to sleep here each night.\
  \ She only gets scared at night time, when the wind blows and the storms are bad.\"\
  \n\n\"And what about the pagoda? Did she go to the pagoda during the floods?\" we\
  \ probe.\n\n\"No, she just stayed here, to protect the house from people coming,\
  \ stealing things from the family,\" Mr Ock translates.\n\n\"That's a terrible thing\
  \ for an elder\", our team leader responds. \"Merit-making is really important for\
  \ older people. For merit-making, the elderly regularly visit the pagoda and leave\
  \ a tiny financial contribution - maybe just 100 riel. It's in preparation for passing\
  \ away, for being recieved joyfully by the spirits after death occurs. This old\
  \ girl is really in a bad place, with no means of her own. It's tremendously important\
  \ for the sake of her sense of spiritual peace.\" \n\nWe'd established earlier in\
  \ the interview that the grandmother felt tremendous sadness and guilt over her\
  \ own living status, as she was entirely dependent upon her grand-daughter, who\
  \ also has seven children to raise. The grandmother had been left at home with a\
  \ little rice and fermented fish (prahock) to eat, which had lasted around two weeks\
  \ in the most recent flood. The grand-daughter's husband, a lowly-paid construction\
  \ worker, has no work during the floods each season, so he fishes in the Mekong\
  \ to try to earn something, and to feed the family. In the aftermath of the flood,\
  \ until new crops could be generated, the family was forced to seek a loan from\
  \ the village chief to survive until harvest.\n\n\"I want to leave her with just\
  \ a small financial gift. $20USD in small bills, so she can spin it out at the pagoda.\
  \ She might get six months of merit-making out of that,\" our supervisor reflects\
  \ with us, on bumpy bus-ride back to our hotel.\n\n\"I bet she would give it to\
  \ her grand-daughter,\" I respond, \"but I would love to see her have just a little\
  \ something of her own, too.\" \n\nAnd so we did just that. Within the wrapping\
  \ of a gift of soap, toothpaste and toothbrush, we snuck some low-denomination bills\
  \ and asked Mr Ock to whisper to the grandmother that there was a little something,\
  \ just for herself, inside. The following day we saw her again as we passed by,\
  \ as she visited a neighbours trading stand. No doubt she was getting sweeties for\
  \ the little ones, but I hope she enjoyed one herself."
