Text: "One of the benefit of knowing multiple languages is that you can mix into multiple\
  \ cultures and live any way you want.It was late August, Wednesday evening in Vienna.\
  \ Winters come early here,at least for the tourists like me,locals were not that\
  \ bothered with this sudden change of weather.\n\nMe and a friend of mine who is\
  \ studying in Vienna were getting ready to go to Fania Live Club at U Bahn. It\u2019\
  s a Latin club and that night was jam session, with open stage.As i get into the\
  \ bar ,it seemed me like a portal which  transported me to one of the music video\
  \ of Gente De zona.\nBar was full of Latinos singing traditional Spanish songs with\
  \ most traditional instruments like Timbales, Caj\xF3n ,bongo drums.The vibe and\
  \ music made me forget time until my friend said its half past midnight and he had\
  \ class in morning, \nI should have gone back  with him because I didn\u2019t knew\
  \ the way back.But instead I got on stage and showed off my beatboxing skills until\
  \ it was two in the morning  and me jamming up with last 3 guys on stage ,to almost\
  \ empty bar.\nI finally decided to leave with no idea which direction to go with\
  \ my phone battery dead ,though i knew the name of my area H\xFCtteldorf and I thought\
  \ worst case scenario, I\u2019ll  sit outside the metro station till morning.\n\
  I walked towards the bus stop to find the night bus routes and there I saw a girl\
  \ standing and it  seemed to me that she was crying , so i asked her, \u201Care\
  \ you all right\u201D, to which she gave no reply so i just continued, \u201Ci don\u2019\
  t have to take a bus but i am standing on this side, and will wait until you get\
  \ on your bus safely and if you need any help let me know \u201D.I noticed the next\
  \ bus was coming after 24 minutes so I  started looking at those little maps pasted\
  \ on the bus stop and tried to find H\xFCtteldorf on it. After spending minutes\
  \ making mental notes on directions on which I was confident were wrong ,i noticed\
  \ bus arrived and left but that girl was still there, before leaving I asked her\
  \ again, \u201Care you alright\u201D to which she burst  out crying \u201Cestoy\
  \ perdido\u201D  and I get to know she can only speak Spanish and she was travelling\
  \ from Colombia with her boyfriend, and she got in fight with him at the Fania club\
  \ ,and got out to find lighter to smoke, since then she couldn\u2019t  find him\
  \ ,and her phone, hotel name ,her purse and everything was with him. \nI  suggested\
  \ that maybe he also tried to find her ,but he couldn\u2019t ,so he went to hotel\
  \ to see if she was there . So the challenge was to find an unknown hotel ,in unknown\
  \ city with dead phones and no money.\nJuliana told me that she know way to her\
  \ hotel from St. Stephen's Cathedral and I knew the Donau Kanal, water channel bordering\
  \ the Vienna city centre, where St Stephen cathedral is,so I looked into those little\
  \ maps to find the direction for the canal and we headed towards it.\nWe just had\
  \ to follow the water channel until we were in city center, though we decided to\
  \ walk with the water below the street instead of on the road, Halfway through the\
  \ canal we saw some Skaters at 4 in the morning  on their skateboards with loud\
  \ music on their Bluetooth speakers ,having practice session. I asked help from\
  \ one of them ,and 5 minutes later ,I was riding a bicycle with Juliana sitting\
  \ on the front basket of cycle, and 4 boys on their skateboards and cycles escorting\
  \ us to Cathedral,\nIt took us few circles to find Juliana\u2019s hotel, where we\
  \ also found her boyfriend worried sick.\nAfter this adventure filled night , I\
  \ took a coffee, went to Donau Kanal to see Sunrise ,sat there sighed with little\
  \ reality coming back to me that my vacations are almost over and I have to wait\
  \ for my next vacations to live this adventure filled travel life I want to have\
  \ every day."
