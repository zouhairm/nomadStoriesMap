Text: "Villa Urvinkhan - A little piece of heaven\n\nAs cliche it sounds, my journey\
  \ to a homestay to the green mountains of Mudigere was nothing like what I imagined.\
  \ \n\nFour girls, embarking on a break away from home, away from our usual life\
  \ to reminisce our college days. Our drive to Mudigere from Bangalore was not what\
  \ I expected it to be. Mudigere welcomed us with it's luscious green pathways and\
  \ a breathe of fresh air, reminding my childhood days at my Granny's. The smell\
  \ of the earth, the rustic environment and most of all, down to earth people producing\
  \ one of the best coffee and pepper produce. Being a coffee lover, looking at coffee\
  \ beans plucked and left to dry at every doorstep at Mudigere left my soul, eagerly\
  \ anticipating to the private estate we were going to drive to.\n\nAt afternoon,\
  \ we arrive at this 500 acres private estate at Mudigere and that was just the beginning\
  \ of the drive to the top of the homestay we were going to stay. As we passed by,\
  \ all my attention  was dressed to the coffee and pepper plants intertwined and\
  \ the very people who were indulging in plucking both as it was the season of plucking.\
  \ \n\nOn reaching the top of the estate, at all it's peak I could c this beautiful\
  \ man made structure being welcomed by the staff and again coffee beans everywhere.\
  \ The estate, Villa Urvinkhan as modern it sounds was completely opposite of what\
  \ the name stood for, teak wood engraved doors and pillars, little waterfalls, books\
  \ and a pathway which lead to the infinity pool. This infinity pool was nothing\
  \ unusual but it was nothing like what I had expected. The view from the pool drove\
  \ me immediately to it. The minute I stepped into the pool, and Swam to the end\
  \ of it, my heart was feeling content as it felt like I was in the middle of the\
  \ clouds, a little piece in heaven! \n\nIt dint matter if I was with people around\
  \ me as the view from the infinity pool drew me much closer to the nature and the\
  \ only thing I could experience was peace. Being a city girl, I never liked the\
  \ idea of being in nature and being at peace but the view from the infinity pool,\
  \ the chillness of the water, the thick clouds covering the green mountains in silence\
  \ was nothing that I could have imagined and in a great company of three more girls\
  \ and the local wine was just perfect to end the evening before the fog froze us.\n\
  \nThe next day, I was not looking forward to my trek down to the pond in the estate\
  \ amidst all the coffee and pepper plants in the estate. As scary and unusual, to\
  \ walk down miles to the pond with no directions on GPS (literally the estate staff\
  \ were our GPS and my way out), slippery paths, dried brown barks and trees, couldn't\
  \ get any spookier, we reached this huge pond out of nowhere to the center of nature\
  \ surrounded my mountains and trees and surprisingly beautiful birds that I had\
  \ never seen. Sighting the birds and gazing at the view made the dreadful trek absolutely\
  \ worth it. And off course, icing on the cake was me having caught my first catch,\
  \ a small little fish.\n\nOn reaching the villa, it was almost our time to leave\
  \ and I just couldn't miss my one last dip in the infinity pool by the clouds. I\
  \ swam to the end of the pool to embrace the clouds before I returned to my city\
  \ life.\n\nThis journey I realised, how being in nature I found what I missing from\
  \ the hustle bustle of life, peace and how to love one self, something that I couldn't\
  \ experience with all the money in the world. While this journey was a very short\
  \ one, it thought me how I need to give myself a chance to explore and learn what\
  \ an experience could have an influence on me and now I have embarked on a new journey\
  \ through travel and experience and looking forward to the next one."
