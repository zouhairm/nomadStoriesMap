Text: "Have you ever felt like you don't belong where you are ? Like the people around\
  \ you don't understand the emotions you have or the way you see things? Well, you\
  \ are privileged then, because you are going to be able to understand not only your\
  \ steps but the energy on the way. \nThe first time I travelled to Ghana, was the\
  \ trip of the unknown ... Spanish girl living in the UK, going to a completely different\
  \ culture, weather, people... my fears were bigger than my passion to migrate but\
  \ I did not let my fears to take over.\nFrom the moment I boarded, I  was not really\
  \ conscious of what was happening: so many bags with different colours, people jelling\
  \ at each other in a different language and then suddenly laughing...Once we landed\
  \ the heat was making me uncomfortably sweaty... it was late night so i couldn't\
  \ really see much of what was waiting to change my life.\nAfter a few days of being\
  \ in Accra, I visited all the touristic places, eat at the popular spots and dance\
  \ the local dances... and realised then: That was not what travelling is.\nMy eyes\
  \ were no opened to a new town or country but only to the perception I had in my\
  \ head. \nSince that moment in every step I took, I breathed the essence of the\
  \ land, the colours, the people, the music and understood I was having the beautiful\
  \ chance of rediscovering my own identity based in other people experiences and\
  \ lifestyles .\nSo next time you feel like nobody around you understand the way\
  \ you think or you feel... remember you are having the incredible opportunity of\
  \ rediscover  ing yourself in a different culture and scenario. \nNot time to be\
  \ wasted, pack and go, you will only plus never minus. \n\nAna Rodriguez"
