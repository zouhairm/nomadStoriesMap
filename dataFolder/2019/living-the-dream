Text: "Once I saw a big and shinny moon. His light was so so strong that I couldn't\
  \ sleep. I got up from my bed, put on my shoes and went outside. There was a huge\
  \ mountain next to my house. So I realised that I have to climb. Why? Because I\
  \ wanted to touch that magic moon! \nI knew that something majestic gonna happen.\
  \ And I started my hiking at night trip. To the moon! It took about an hour. And\
  \ suddenly I was on the edge of the world. I saw everything with a new eyes. I touched\
  \ that magic moon and he changed my life. I realised that there are so many beautiful\
  \ things around me, but I couldn't see because I was blind. But now I can see everything.\
  \ And even more! I can see myself. For the first time in my life I am that human\
  \ being that I always wanted to be. \nThank you, luna. You are my guide. \n\nI woke\
  \ up. It was just 5.30 in the early morning. My headache was killing me... I realised\
  \ that yesterday I had too much Rioja. But it was impossible to stop drinking when\
  \ pizza and that magic red wine were just amazing couple for my tongue... \nYes.\
  \ This is Italy. The best place in the world to have a romantic trip with yourself...\
  \ When pizza and a red wine are having love in your mouth. Cin cin!"
