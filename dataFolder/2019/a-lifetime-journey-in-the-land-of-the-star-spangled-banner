Text: "Playing soccer in an American diplomat\u2019s yard, spending  a night singing\
  \ \u201CWe Are Young\u201D in the airport because the flight was delayed 12 hours,\
  \ being shocked with the size of a slice of pizza and how spicy it was, screaming\
  \ and laughing at the same time I felt my hands burning with the crazy cold of snow\
  \ when I tried to build a snowman and being extremely happy with teaching American\
  \ high schoolers to dance typical Brazilian songs wasn\u2019t the kind of thing\
  \ I expected to do. To my surprise,I was selected as one of the 50 Youth Ambassadors\
  \ that would represent Brazil in the United States. Nevertheless, it was this very\
  \ experience that taught me more about diversity, friendship, justice and human\
  \ values than I had learned in my entire life!\n               It was January 12th\
  \ 2019. I was in the American Airlines airplane looking amazed to that unknown frozen\
  \ water dripping from the sky when the pilot announced \u201CWe welcome you to Washington\
  \ DC\u201D and I finally started to believe I was landing in Tio Sam\u2019s land\
  \ and about to have my life transformed. As an 18-year old boy coming from a small\
  \ community in the countryside and one who had never traveled abroad, I had no idea\
  \ about all the incredible and unexpected moments I would experience over the next\
  \ three weeks as an exchange student with the mission of sharing his country in\
  \ a totally unknown place. \n                During the 21 days I spent in the Star-Spangled\
  \ Banner country, I had the opportunity of diving in a culture that I initially\
  \ judged so different and, more than that, I could live it and really be part of\
  \ it. In the first week having leadership, social justice and design-thinking workshops\
  \ in the 4-H National Conference Center, in Maryland, I figured out how wrong they\
  \ were when they said \u201CAmerican people are cold and don\u2019t you dare hug\
  \ them\u201D. Surprisingly, no one really cares about receiving an extra portion\
  \ of human heat when it\u2019s -18\xB0 C and you can\u2019t feel your body, trust\
  \ me. I am forever thankful for listening to them as they taught me how not to freeze\
  \ or catch on fire in the bath or explained how the American education and politics\
  \ work. I learned a lot, but nothing compared with what I would experience in the\
  \ second week in Louisville, KY.\n              We were divided into 4 different\
  \ groups and traveled to different host cities. Besides participating in volunteering\
  \ activities and exploring the U.S. by a closer perspective, we could live with\
  \ a host family and really see the american way of life through a unique vision.\
  \ If I would need to pick up one of my top 5 favorite moments in the trip eating\
  \ Mexican food with an Indian family as listening to Italian music and talking about\
  \ \u201CHow the American shutdown affects China\u201D would be in the first 100\
  \ positions. It was not only about getting new parents and two sisters for 12 days,\
  \ it was about expanding my grip of love. \n          \u201CI have a dream that\
  \ one day everyone over this Earth will live a life-changing experience like the\
  \ one I lived in here at least once in the lifetime\u201D. It was what I said to\
  \ the watchful crowd gathered to watch my \u201CI Have a Dream\u201D speech in the\
  \ Lincoln Memorial\u2019s stairs, the same place Martin Luther King Jr originally\
  \ spoke. I remember I was kind of sad because it was our last hours in Washington\
  \ DC before taking the bus back to the airport. Even so, beyond all the tears that\
  \ started to come up and the feeling of leaving, I also was extremely happy for\
  \ being surrounded by such a heterogeneous group and for everything I lived, learned,\
  \ laughed and even cried about.\n                Flying back to my home country,\
  \ I looked at the window and, as I saw all those lights becoming more and more distant\
  \ until disappear completely, I told myself and I could not be surer of the truth\
  \ in those words: \u201CKnowing the unknown, you became not only a better kind of\
  \ leader or young, you became a better kind of human being.\u201D"
