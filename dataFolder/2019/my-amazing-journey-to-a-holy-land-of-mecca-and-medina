Text: "It happened in June 2013. My first trip to Saudi Arabia in order to perform\
  \ an Umroh pilgrimage for 9 days. I traveled to Saudi Arabia with my Auntie and\
  \ two Uncles along with 20 other people under the same travel agent. We flew from\
  \ Jakarta Airport, Indonesia by Qatar Airways transited to Doha, Qatar continued\
  \ to Medina and stayed there for 4 days before finally landed up in Mecca as our\
  \ final destination.\n\nI was amazed and thrilled to see millions of people coming\
  \ to Medina and Mecca from around the world with different social backgrounds, languages,\
  \ ages and races for one similar reason that was to worship and testified the glory\
  \ of Almighty God. I was very happy that I finally could visit Kabah, the house\
  \ of God, the center of Islamic religious activities and civilization in the world\
  \ in Mecca.\n\nIt was a tough journey but worthy because I had to fly far away from\
  \ home and leave my family and friends for a while. I had learnt how to be more\
  \ patient, grateful and sincere when dealing with millions of pilgrims who performed\
  \ the umroh rituals.\n\nDuring in Medina and Mecca, we led by an Indonesia tour\
  \ guide who could speak Arabic and Bahasa as well. Our travel agent had arranged\
  \ us for some tour objects to Medina, Mecca and Jeddah beside our umroh pilgrimage\
  \ program. We visited our prophet Muhammad's tomb and the Caliphs' inside the Nabawi\
  \ Mosque at Medina. The tour continued to a largest graveyard at Medina called \"\
  Baqi\" where most prophet Muhammad's family and moslems martyrs buried there. We\
  \ also prayed at Quba Mosque, a mosque that prophet Muhammad first built which was\
  \ located 3 kms in south Nabawi Mosque in Medina.\n\nShopping was one of our agenda\
  \ when we tripped to Medina. That's why we stopped to a largest dates plant and\
  \ store in Medina to shop the authentic Arabian food and souvenirs. On the next\
  \ day, we visited to the famous Mount Uhud in Medina which was one of war location\
  \ when prophet Muhammad was alive. The rock mountain of Uhud was so high and it\
  \ took hours to climb on it. Unluckily, we could only see and took some pictures\
  \ from below mountain. The rest of the day we focused on praying at Nabawi Mosque.\n\
  \nAfter spending 4 days at Medina, we embarked to Mecca to continue our umroh rituals.\
  \ In Mecca, we lived in a 4 star hotel which was 3 kms far from Masjidil Haram Mosque.\
  \ I saw more people coming and staying at Mecca. I finally got used to live here,\
  \ to be more adaptive with the climate, the Arabian culinary and its culture. I\
  \ made some conversations with other pilgrimages as well as the local people. In\
  \ fact the local merchants could speak Bahasa too. They were so friendly and it\
  \ made me feel like home. \n\nIn Mecca, all of tour members have completely performed\
  \ umroh rituals which was started from Tawaf (walking around the Kabah and praying)\
  \ for 7 times, did Sa'i (walking or running) from Safa hill to Marwah Hill for 7\
  \ times per ritual and finally we did Tahalul (got our hair cut) to end the rituals.\
  \ We did it twice on 2 days.\n\nIn order to complete our trip to Mecca, we also\
  \ visited some tour objects like Hira Cave. A cave the prophet Muhammad got his\
  \ first revelation from Archangel Gabriel to spread Islam religion to the world.\
  \ Thus we visited Mount Arafah and Mount Rahmah. According to Islam, Mount Rahmah\
  \ is a well- known place where prophet Adam met his wife, Eve for the very first\
  \ time after they coming down from heaven. That's why so many people believe they\
  \ will find their soulmate if they make a wish above mount Rahmah. \n\nOn our last\
  \ trip, we stopped at Jeddah for praying at floating mosque and shopping at local\
  \ market before we flew back home. Thank god we safely arrived with content and\
  \ happy feeling. Yes, it was an amazing journey for me and I would do it again for\
  \ the rest of my life because for me life is a series of wonderful journey."
