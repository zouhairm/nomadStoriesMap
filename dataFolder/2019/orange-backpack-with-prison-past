Text: "I sat in real prison without any permission, just because some guy told to\
  \ police, that he saw some man with orange backpack.\nSo, the time is coming. I\
  \ can share the most curious situation and most irresponsible behaviour in my travel\
  \ experience.\n\nDec 29. 11:34 PM. Turkish south coast. I was going by hitchhike\
  \ with some man to Antalya, where I had a place to sleep and eat for closest 2 days.\
  \ Everything seemed perfect. Till time when I did not see a hugest one ferry in\
  \ my life. I asked driver about it and where they go.  He said, \u2018Cyprus\u2018\
  . After 30 seconds our car had stopped by driver near ferry ticket office and I\
  \ decided that tomorrow I want to wake up on the island. After 20 minutes I made\
  \ a leap like Leonadro Di Caprio did in \"Titanic\", when he won in cards with his\
  \ friend. Having listened Celine Dion music twice on the deck I fell asleep with\
  \ thought about Rosa and Jack on the bench without any payment.\n\nDec 30. 3:15\
  \ PM . I left ferry on Turkish side of Cyprus (then I did not know that Cyprus is\
  \ divided into two parts - for me it was always associated with Europe). I found\
  \ CS host and after 30-40 minutes he picked me up. I spend night there and on the\
  \ deeply morning, after understood all my situation, I decided to go to my embassy\
  \ to ask them help me. I have not reached two hundred meters. A passing man thought\
  \ that I had a relationship with the mafia (my orange backpack), and told the police\
  \ about it that was across the road. After this I had 4 hours of miss understanding\
  \ with police because nobody speaks English and I did not have an internet.\n\n\
  It was at the new police station near oldest Nikosia area. Two guys told me that\
  \ I will go to prison for nondetermined interval. It was deeply morning of 31 January.\
  \ When police guy gave you a box for all your stuff (include phone and money too),\
  \ you begining to remember all criminal movie related with this atmoshere. And when\
  \ you see to much guys with tatoo and their hands, which keep in gate bar you thinking\
  \ that is film yet. But, when your \"appartment\" closed your eyes instintincly\
  \ become blured, and you understanding that this is your reality for this time interval.\
  \ It was too much things what I feld there and understood. \n\nAfter lunch, a small\
  \ riot began. But what struck me most was not the prison, not its orders, but the\
  \ situation when I calmed down and left my cell, offering one Indian to explain\
  \ how times are organized in English (he understood a little English). After I started\
  \ to draw a table of times on the floor with a pencil, people began to gather around\
  \ us and soon all the prisoners of that block (23 people) stood above me and watched\
  \ what I was drawing. They were not just watching, they were trying to understand.\
  \ Just imagine that tattooed men who used drugs, killed people, leaned over me and\
  \ tried to understand what I explained in a language they did not understand. Tears\
  \ were dripping from my eyes, but I was happy, happy that they were around me, that\
  \ they were like protection. Then I stopped being afraid of them. Two hours later\
  \ I was free. My Ambassador on Skype called this prison, and the consul personally\
  \ came.\n\nSo, what i did? I \"crossed the border of occupation republic\".It was\
  \ too much curious and miss understanding situations, which I can't fully tell there.\
  \ There is emotional aspect, with which I want to share, because it changed my look\
  \ for many things.\n\nDec 31. 7:00 PM. I got out of prison, fell on the grass and\
  \ just cried looking at the sky. The first time I felt a taste of freedom on my\
  \ lips. Two hours later, I was hoste by an agnostic who does not recognize the new\
  \ year. When the clock showed midnight we discussed the topic of sexual abuse while\
  \ watching the episode of Black Mirror. It was the best New Year I ever had."
