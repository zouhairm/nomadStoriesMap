Text: "It\u2019s 1996. The musty cinema is emptying. There\u2019s an Aunt and two\
  \ nieces in the back row of the cinema. The end credits of Free Willy tumble down\
  \ the screen accompanied by Michael Jackson\u2019s Will you be there? The youngest\
  \ is bored. She\u2019s under the seat, colouring in a maths book. But the oldest\
  \ is transfixed, gripping the threadbare crimson arm rests, pushing herself up and\
  \ towards the sprawling ocean. Her blue eyes are wide and tears of seawater are\
  \ waterfalling down her cheeks. She is swimming with orcas. The great black and\
  \ white whale is over the wall towards freedom and family. Just beneath the scrolling\
  \ credits, pod after pod of wild orcas are breaching, tail slapping, feeding and\
  \ travelling. The cinema no longer exists. \nIn a travel magazine, I saw a breaching\
  \ orca against a copper sky. The Azores. A Portuguese archipelago of nine volcanic\
  \ islands. A string of moldavite beads in the wild Atlantic Ocean.  I ripped out\
  \ the page and pressed it into my diary. I began to save. I was going to see the\
  \ whales\u2026 \nTraditionally, Azoreans were infamous whalers. In Melville\u2019\
  s Moby Dick, American whaling companies recruited Azoreans because they were the\
  \ \u201Cbest whalemen\u201D on earth. Despite the whaling ban in \u201882, whales\
  \ were still hunted and killed around Azorean shores until \u201887. These whalers\
  \ used traditional methods, long boats and hand held spears, which are now on display\
  \ at Pico\u2019s Whaling Industry Museum. From high upon the volcanic island ridges,\
  \  vigias (watchman) would wait patiently using binoculars to pierce through fog\
  \ and sea mist to spot the silent blow before crying out, \u201CBaleia a vista\u201D\
  \ (a whale in sight). \nToday, the Azores is an unrivaled whale watching destination;\
  \ one of the world\u2019s largest cetacean sanctuaries. Over 25 species of whale\
  \ can be spotted from both boats and shore. Every year of research brings new discoveries\
  \ about the intelligence and sophistication of these ocean giants. \nI knew that\
  \ orcas have a sixth sense, echolocation, which they use to hunt, navigate and detect\
  \ threats. However, recent studies revealed several whales combine their echo signals\
  \ to collectively construct a clearer image of their environment. They see better\
  \ together. The orcas I fell in love with in that 90s cinema remain in family pods\
  \ for life. An orca will never leave its pod. If one member is stranded, the pod\
  \ will collectively, intentionally beach: presumably, it is better to die together\
  \ than live apart. They know what loyalty is. Their bonds are unbreakable. They\
  \ teach us what family can be.  \nIt\u2019s early. I, along with eight others, am\
  \ sat on an inflatable searib the colour of satsumas. Between the rib and the promise\
  \ of whales is a veil of choppy, dark-blue waves.  I am transfixed, watching hopefully\
  \ as the 8am rose gold sunshine illuminates the water. There\u2019s cerulean, lapis,\
  \ indigo, streaks of plum, iris, lavender. The oceanic borealis. Shimmering glimpses\
  \ of krill and sardines drift by like aquatic fireflies below me, their sparkling\
  \ trails writing messages I want to understand.  \nIt\u2019s still. No one says\
  \ a word. We are watching. Waiting. \nAnd then they\u2019re there. Suddenly, the\
  \ borealis is overpowered by darkness, as if black ink has spilt and bloomed. A\
  \ flash of white. The saddle patch of a female is within six foot of us.  There\u2019\
  s one, two, and in an instant fifteen female orcas break into our world. As they\
  \ surface, their whooshing exhales send bursts of spray high into the air. Rainbows.\
  \ The whales make rainbows. I hold my breath. Their bramble-like dorsals are curved\
  \ and clean. Whales are born from the waves they ride, like underwater surfers catching\
  \ every break.  They\u2019re playful, curious, circling our rib and spyhopping,\
  \ tailslapping before sinking below the surface. Against the backdrop of a volcanic\
  \ paradise, I try to imagine how anyone could ever want to harm a whale.  \nToday,\
  \ the vigias work with researchers to learn about the behaviours of these ocean\
  \ giants. The whale boats are full of humans pointing cameras not spears. As our\
  \ rib turns back towards mainland, all I want to do is stay; out here, in the Atlantic\
  \ Ocean, having a whale of a time."
