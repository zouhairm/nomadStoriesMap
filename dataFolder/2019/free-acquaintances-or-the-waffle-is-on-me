Text: "\u201CThe waffle is on me\u201D, the waiter of the airport cafe couldn\u2019\
  t even imagine that some minutes later he would become the hero of my story. \n\n\
  The feeling I wanted to write on this long night was completed by him. I was persuading\
  \ myself that the reason I am just procrastinating and not writing is tiredness.\
  \ Because I have chosen the transit flight. It is cheaper. Besides, saving has become\
  \ a new profession for me as a volunteer over this last year. And suddenly\u2026\
  \ Wow, a free waffle in the expensive homeland of waffles\u2026\n\nThe Belgian waffle\
  \ with a cup of morning coffee combined with the airport crowd is not only a pleasure\
  \ but also it is worth to be put on the sweet memory shelf. He could have guessed\
  \ that I was going to buy only coffee and was just curious to know the price of\
  \ the waffle, since I asked very casually. I overwhelmed my bag with too many sweets\
  \ and still have to save up for my Catalan trip (the profession speaks).\n\nBefore\
  \ going closer to the caf\xE9 I was thinking how small people feel themselves in\
  \ such cities. Some months ago I would walk around Brussels as well and explored\
  \ the city by myself. People were so different and numerous. You don\u2019t know\
  \ anybody and if you are lost or feel bad, nobody would notice. \n\nHowever, I might\
  \ be noticed now, after the long night here I feel at home. In the morning I even\
  \ wanted to greet everyone who had to sleep on that cold floor just like me. Sure,\
  \ this nice black girl sitting next to me would also notice my disappearance, we\
  \ have already gotten closer and started taking care of each other. \n\nAll these\
  \ travel and sweet situations begin at the end of your comfort zone, once you stop\
  \ your everyday life and go to meet strangers. \n\nFight your fears that strangers\
  \ are \u201Cstrange\u201Ders, hence, they are dangerous. Even in this multinational\
  \ and \u201Cterror city\u201D Brussels an unknown waiter is paying for my waffle.\
  \ Now I just want to remember who among my European acquaintances has made such\
  \ a big step. \n\nSo many friends I made during this last year just through being\
  \ hosted or hosting strangers. Indeed, it is dangerous to sleep at a stranger\u2019\
  s flat whom you have just met on CouchSurfing.com, or host an unknown person. With\
  \ some of them you could even get so close that you would fill your friend list.\
  \ By using Couchsurfing, I always stayed at very cozy apartments, and twice (!)\
  \ I had a free room that was even better than my own, at my parent\u2019s flat.\
  \ Some of the Couchsurfers even trusted me with the key to the flat. Moreover, even\
  \ hitchhiking, an adventure that most people perceive as very dangerous, can lead\
  \ to newly found love. Really, a friend of mine met her future boyfriend by hitchhiking.\
  \ However, I have never liked the guy, I am not the one going to kiss him. \n\n\
  Just look, all your friends, even the old ones initially were strangers to you as\
  \ well. Perhaps the only difference was the destination, you met them in your country\
  \ or just inside of your comfort zone. \n\nBelieve me, it makes life easier if you\
  \ think this way. You feel comfortable everywhere and you are open to meet all strangers.\
  \ By the way, agree that nationality also does not matter in this case. For example,\
  \ is it really important to know from where the waiter paying for my waffle is?\
  \ Nonetheless, if I had met him in my country, I could also have given him the Armenian\
  \ sweet pakhlava. But now I couldn\u2019t even manage to say the last goodbye, in\
  \ some hours his co-worker is already standing in the same place."
