Text: "As I live in a place where the nearest border is at least 15 hours away, I\
  \ had always wondered what would it be like to stand in two countries at the same\
  \ time. When on a trip to Germany I was told there was this spot where three countries\
  \ converged, I decided to go. \nI took the next train to Aachen. When arriving I\
  \ was not sure if would find what I expected to find. As I approached the Altstadt\
  \ (or city center), I got enchanted by the rhythm of the city: water, artworks,\
  \ people, change, flow... Floor tiles got smaller and statues and fountains depicting\
  \ history or myths of the city appeared more often. I followed the pile of artworks\
  \ of the past century, amazed by interactive pieces, such as Puppenbrunnen, where\
  \ I, just like other adults and children, would stop to change the position of the\
  \ arms and legs of the dolls of that fountain. This allowed me, and any other viewer,\
  \ to interrelate to the stream of the city while showing others my own vision of\
  \ the world \u2013 or at least a part of it - through an art piece. \nI kept walking\
  \ the streets of the city with no fixed route, I felt as if I was moving towards\
  \ a hidden treasure that perhaps I was not meant to find. Was this indeed a compelling\
  \ city or was \u2018beauty merely in \u2013 my eye \u2013 the eye of the beholder\u2019\
  ? Did Charlemagne make Aachen great or did he just live up to his mission and achieved\
  \ to preserve the vibes of a city that had conquered his soul in such a way that\
  \ he had decided to call it home during his life (and after his death)? \nI arrived\
  \ to the core of the city, Aachen\u2019s cathedral. As I entered the small but magnificent\
  \ Palatine Chapel, incense filled my lungs and let me perceive a glimpse of greatness.\
  \ \u2018Charles the great did make things great\u2019 I thought as I admired tall\
  \ marble columns connecting the place I was standing on with the ceiling filled\
  \ with golden flowers and spirals portraying stars in the dark blue sky. It suddenly\
  \ hit me; this had been for centuries the heart of an empire whose spirit remains.\
  \ Aachen, which means water, had long been a like the starting point of a river\
  \ of greatness to spread.\nMy vision had changed. I continued my journey towards\
  \ my original destination, but now realizing I was not walking towards a border\
  \ nor a magical spot, \u2018crossing\u2019 limits and borders is merely on our minds\
  \ and our constructs. This time, I was walking uphill deeper and deeper into a forest\
  \ of what was now a neighbouring country, but I knew I was merely exploring the\
  \ region where the essence of an empire that inspired future generations remained.\
  \ \nI saw a double rainbow that day, and few but very friendly people crossed my\
  \ way. Did Charlemagne fell in love with these amazing landscapes I experienced\
  \ on a single day or did he feel he belonged while meeting people like the ones\
  \ who made me feel like home? I guess we will never truly know, but a hunch tells\
  \ me he felt for Aachen homeland love, just like the song in my country, which talks\
  \ about the wish to be buried at home in case one died in a foreign land, except\
  \ it is about a completely different land."
