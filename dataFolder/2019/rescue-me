Text: "Rescue me! \n\n3,885 meters, stretching as if underneath our feet there would\
  \ be the Sahara desert and not a simple bridge. For a moment my eyes wandered to\
  \ the lights of the dream-like city we left behind, wondering what beautiful, romantic\
  \ or even tragic stories might be hiding in those lagoons under the Italian sun.\n\
  But the heavy bag strapped over one shoulder which started aching and the suitcase\
  \ I was dragging along with a broken handle had reality get the better of me soon\
  \ enough. Underneath the bridge was seemingly endless water, in which the full moon\
  \ seemed to bath and gave the impression of creamy, rich milk. Cars were rushing\
  \ by, disturbing my dreams. I was wondering if anyone has ever tried to swim across\
  \ the distance from the city centre of Venice to the quarters Mestre and Maghera.\
  \ Unfortunately I never found an answer.\n \n James, my boyfriend, signalled me\
  \ to hurry up. At this point I almost gave up hope  as our flight back to D\xFC\
  sseldorf was due all too soon. And the bus was canceled with no more information.\
  \ How could we have assumed that travelling back to the airport from one of the\
  \ most touristy cities in the world would be our greatest issue? Signore, aspetta\
  \ per favore... We tried to catch a taxi but were hit by the next obstacle at once.\
  \ Cash .As my salary didn't arrive on time, we ran out of money.\n \n In the morning\
  \ we had no better idea then to leave as early as possible and start walking into\
  \ the  night. Right until then this long week end trip had been the perfect Valentines\
  \ Day gift. I breathed in the crisp air that smelled so different and tried to walk\
  \ faster along the ever stretching pathway, just behind the crash barriers that\
  \ made my mind come up with visions of roads leading to nowhere. James signalled\
  \ me to put my thumb up, knowing that a damsel in distress might garner more attention\
  \ by the passers by. So we trotted along as fast as we could, the clock ticking\
  \ away. After ten minutes and a lot of buses who drove by and made me wish I could\
  \ turn back time, a fair share of honking and many nervous glances on  our cellphones\
  \ later, a car stopped. A dark haired young Venetian looked  at us with a puzzled\
  \ expression on his face: \u201CVa al aeroporte?\u201D No, he was not going to the\
  \ airport and I didn't react fast enough. After all the effort and time I had put\
  \ into learning Italian, I tumbled over my own tongue. He closed the window and\
  \ drove off. \u201CWhy didn't you ask him at least to take us over the bridge?\u201D\
  \ asked James.    \n \u201CThe words just didn't come out...\u201D We burst out\
  \ laughing and kept on trotting along with our luggage that seemed to become heavier\
  \ step by step. \n\n  The end of the bridge finally came into view and we ran out\
  \ of time, no more cars would stop and we now reached the motorway. Tears shot into\
  \ my eyes. We looked at each other and within seconds the decision was made. We\
  \ had to climb over the metal crash barrier to keep walking as we were entering\
  \ the slip road of the motorway. At this point, following an Italian motorway in\
  \ the dark, I felt the chance to get on our flight slipping through our fingers.\
  \ More and more frequently I checked the time which seemed to pass faster and faster.\
  \ As we arrived at a small motorway service station James waved at a taxi. Maybe\
  \ we would look pitiful enough. Within the next minutes I started believing in luck\
  \ again. The driver took my emergency credit card. \n\n  In the end I don't regret\
  \ any of the weird, wonderful and and even scary things that can happen when the\
  \ magic of a new place keeps you captivated, a great adventure, not simply a great\
  \ disaster and we knew that next time we would tell the story or think about it\
  \ we would laugh and it would put a smile on our faces, creating an unbreakable,\
  \ invisible bond only we would understand."
