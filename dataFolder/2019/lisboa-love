Text: "I\u2019m Maedeh! Originally from Tehran/Iran, I lived from 2010 to 2017 in\
  \ China and since October 2017 I am living in Germany. \nIn China I met many people\
  \ from different regions, different continents and various countries.. Untill one\
  \ day that I and my friend waved two guys who were sitting outside of Starbucks\
  \ drinking coffee! Since they waved us back with a big smile, we short the way with\
  \ our Ebikes and went closer to say hi! (It is very casual and normal of foreigners\
  \ to greet each other or just start talking to each other in china specially in\
  \ smaller cities where there not much foreigners around).. \nAs always the next\
  \ thing to say after a HELLO, was WHERE ARE YOU FROM?! \nThey replied: we are from\
  \ Portugal, Lisbon! Wow! All I knew untill then about Portugal was Christians Ronaldo\
  \ and nothing else! I have had friends from 40 plus different countries by then\
  \ but never a Portuguese friend.. Yeah, they were the first ever Portuguese I met\
  \ in my life and they\u2019re we\u2019re super fun and friendly.. We exchanged numbers\
  \ and texted for couple of times and that was the beginning of starting party in\
  \ Portuguese way and enjoy long talks of cultural things in Portugal.... Until in\
  \ one of our parties together ..\n(To Be continued)..."
