Text: "It was the winter low season in Puebla de Sanabria, with no festivals or pilgrimages\
  \ scheduled for months, but my traveling companion, Daniel, felt lucky to grab the\
  \ last one-star hotel room in the historical center. Puebla is one of the official\
  \ Most Beautiful Villages in Spain, a France-inspired list that began in 2011 as\
  \ a way to promote rural tourism. It\u2019s working.\n\nWe\u2019d come to see Romanesque\
  \ buildings, but quickly found that the churches on my bucket list were closed for\
  \ visits until Easter week. We were left with buying souvenirs or walking among\
  \ the pristine streets to admire the popular architecture. It wasn\u2019t a bad\
  \ consolation prize, because aside from the occasional car and a dragon-faced rainspout\
  \ the residents couldn\u2019t resist, the old town of Puebla looks as it must have\
  \ in the sixteenth or seventeenth century. Tawny stones fit together in pleasant\
  \ haphazard puzzles, noble crests adorn palaces, and extended eaves and colonnades\
  \ provide shelter from wet weather. We aren\u2019t the only visitors to get the\
  \ sense that this is a place untouched by time. \n\nAfter the climb to the robust,\
  \ legend-filled castle at the top of Puebla\u2019s dramatic rocky outcrop, we stood\
  \ at the gusty vista point to gaze down at the river and newer part of town below.\
  \ We read a plaque that advocates a tenuous connection between this place and Miguel\
  \ de Cervantes, then headed west on streets lustrous with slate paving beneath balconies\
  \ made of hand-carved wood. It wasn\u2019t long before we arrived at the other side\
  \ of the rock, a parapet facing a green valley and the setting sun. A line of yet\
  \ more historical homes cozied up to the bottom of the rock, but one caught our\
  \ attention because the roof, near our eye level, was a timber grid, and stacks\
  \ of slate tiles awaited placement.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019re really doing that up right,\u201D\
  \ said Daniel. \u201CIt\u2019ll fit in with the other houses, and it\u2019ll last\
  \ forever.\u201D \n\nA cat darted across the parapet, shooed by a woman in house\
  \ slippers and a T-shirt farther down the street. \u201CSorry,\u201D she said as\
  \ we approached. \u201CThe cats get into my plants!\u201D \n\nPots and vases covered\
  \ the parapet in front of her house, which she said they\u2019d built in the 80s\
  \ with high hopes. \u201CIt\u2019s really big,\u201D she said. \u201CIt\u2019s only\
  \ this wide, but goes way back, and it has two stories and the attic, which we were\
  \ allowed to build because the house that was here before had one.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  This was only built in the 80s? It looks much more historical,\u201D said Daniel.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThe city makes us use traditional materials. See, the window frames\
  \ are wooden. The sun batters the fa\xE7ade in the summer\u2014it gets to be 40\
  \ degrees Celsius right here.\u201D I believed her. At sunset in February, my jacket\
  \ already felt heavy. \u201CAnd in the winter, the frost comes and splits the wood,\
  \ not matter how hard it is.\u201D\n\n\u201CThey make PVC that looks a lot like\
  \ wood now,\u201D said Daniel. \n\n\u201CI wish I could use PVC, but the city won\u2019\
  t let me. It has to be authentic for the tourists.\u201D\n\nBlack mascara that must\u2019\
  ve once matched her hair color ran down her cheeks in the tracks of old tears. Her\
  \ husband had passed away five years before. The children had all moved away, one\
  \ as far as Valencia. They encouraged their mother to convert the grand family inheritance\
  \ into a hotel, like many of the other homes in the old town. Otherwise, it was\
  \ headed for neglect and ruin, with no one there to care for it. It looked as if\
  \ the woman wanted to tell us she would live forever to personally take care of\
  \ this legacy. \n\nWhen we said our goodbyes and moved on, I spied the shadow of\
  \ someone waiting for the woman at the end of the hall. A sister or cousin, as bent\
  \ by time as she, hadn\u2019t made it into her loneliness narrative. But I was relieved\
  \ she had some company in her battle against the two fronts of history and progress.\
  \ Puebla de Sanabria is touched by time, after all."
