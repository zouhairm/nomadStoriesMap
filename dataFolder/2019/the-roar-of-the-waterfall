Text: "It\u2019s 5 in the morning. She shakes Vincent's head to wake him up. Robin\
  \ is waiting in the other room, ready to go. Typically German. She could not sleep\
  \ for the all night, excited as she was, so she is already all set as well.\nThey\
  \ jump in the saddle of their motorcycles. She is the pillion passenger in Robin's\
  \ scooter, holding her professional camera with one hand, the other arm around his\
  \ waist.\nThe wind hits their faces while they drive on the dirt roads of Pak Chong\
  \ district.\nWhen they enter Khao Yai National Park, their hearts are racing. In\
  \ front of them, a long tree-bordered trail. They feel the adrenaline in their veins.\
  \ There is no one around, just them and the quiet nature. They can hear the wind\
  \ whistling, the birds chirping, other sounds unknown to them coming from the deep\
  \ woods. While they drive, the rumble of their scooters is the only noise fading\
  \ the symphony of the jungle.\nOn their way to the waterfall, they run into a group\
  \ of macaques. \n\u201CStop the motorbike!\u201D\n\u201CDon\u2019t go too close,\
  \ they might steal your bag.\u201D\n\u201CDon\u2019t look at them into the eyes,\
  \ they feel threatened.\u201D\nFew shots and they are back towards their destination.\
  \ \n\nJust a few days back they did not know each other. An Italian, a German and\
  \ a Canadian living their dream to travel solo in the Land of Smiles. By a twist\
  \ of fate, they happened to arrive the same day at the Early Bird hostel in the\
  \ historic city of Ayutthaya. The day after, they rented three bikes and explored\
  \ the historical park together. Among the ruins of the ancient capital, their friendship\
  \ was born.\nSolo travelers do not plan ahead. If they have plans, they are ready\
  \ to reprogram everything for the sake of living an adventure off plan. That\u2019\
  s why they decided to divert from their paths and take the road to Khao Yai National\
  \ Park. They wanted to breathe the air of the jungle.\n \nThey leave their scooters\
  \ and walk for around twenty minutes before reaching a long stairway made of bamboo.\
  \ At the bottom, a crowd of Thai tourists is staring at the panorama. The waterfall\
  \ is beautiful. Is that what they were looking for?\nThe day before, their host\
  \ \u2013 a wonderful Thai woman \u2013 explained to them how to arrive at a better\
  \ panoramic point. Therefore, after a couple of pictures, they decide to go back\
  \ and look for the other path. They find a second stairway, hidden from the main\
  \ trail. No one is climbing those stairs, which bring to a more difficult and longer\
  \ path.\nWhen she finally reaches the top, she is literally out of breath. In front\
  \ of them, the view is astonishing. None of them dare to say a word. The waterfall\
  \ is three levels higher than what they could see from below. Around them, thousands\
  \ of trees cover the horizon, hiding the animals of the jungle. Silence, the rustling\
  \ of leaves kissed by the wind, the roar of the falling water. \nThis is the most\
  \ precious gift life has given to them since their trip began. A taste of what awaits\
  \ them. \nThis is their moment. Just the three of them, staring at the edge of infinity,\
  \ enjoying a sublime peacefulness that can only be experienced in a few places and\
  \ a few moments in one\u2019s life."
