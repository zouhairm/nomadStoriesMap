Text: "I am a 32 old Argentine girl from Buenos Aires.\nI have tourism studies and\
  \ a I am a traveling lover. \nTroughout my whole life I've beenn working just for\
  \ the sake of being able to travel throughout the whole world. It is my dream to\
  \ visit every continent in the planet and being able to share it with everybody\
  \ now,  with social media makes it all much more interesting. I enjoy cooking and\
  \ eating, trying new techniques and ingredients. I'm fond of art history and I'm\
  \ learning how to take amazing photographs. \nIt all started as a child, I'm lucky\
  \ to have a traveling dad. Since I can remember we always had at least 3 destinations\
  \ per year. My country Argentina is huge and it has all tipe of climates and landscapes\
  \ itself. We went from Jujuy to Tierra del fuego, getting to know a most all of\
  \ our 23 provinces.\nWe traveled to Chile, Uruguay and Brazil several times and\
  \ finally every child's dream we visited Miami and Disneyworld.\nAs a 15 year old\
  \ I got the options, either a quincea\xF1era party or a big trip. Obviously my choice\
  \ was New York, I was amazed with the whole city and promised myself to return as\
  \ an adult.\nAs I grew up I had several trips to different cities and estates in\
  \ Brazil and Uruguay again, but now with the company of friends or boyfriends. \n\
  A year and a half ago my current boyfriend and best friend for 7 years now, offered\
  \ me to just leave, let's go somewhere and then plan a trip as time goes by. I said\
  \ yes, with the biggest smile in my face, a marriage proposal wouldn't be as exiting\
  \ to me as it was what he proposed. We started in Costa Rica for three months we\
  \ traveled trought the whole country, it's very little and has the biggest biodiversity\
  \ in the world. Just amazing, the jungle and the people, the way the handle life\
  \ in a totally different way than us in the big cities. During our stay there we\
  \ did some small visits to Nicaragua and Panama, and promised ourselves to explore\
  \ central America more deeply in the future.\nWe found some cheap tickets to Zurich,\
  \ Switzerland, so there we go Europe.\nIt was our first time in a different continent\
  \ and we planned a minimum schedule trip, from there on we had to decide by the\
  \ minute.\nSo we started from Zurich to Venice Italy, a lifetime dream, those canals\
  \ and stories. I am very lucky to have a book as a boyfriend so I never need to\
  \ book tour, I have the tourguide with me all the time. He is the cultural guide\
  \ I am the map. He always moks me, he says I am a living GPS.\nNext stop, Florence,\
  \ architecture museums and the most beautiful country side. We were getting closer,\
  \ mythology, films, books here we are! Rome the city was incredible from the ruins\
  \ to the metro in 1 minute. I have never walked so much in my life, sore feet were\
  \ all worth it, 5 days were not enough there was lots of hidden places and amazing\
  \ secrets left to know. We then had to go ahead with our minimum plan, last destination,\
  \ Barcelona. We ad a super short plane trip and arrived in Spain, it was good to\
  \ arrive in a spanish speaking county, but we were amazed to know that we did not\
  \ understand a thing, as Catalan rules there and it not as easy to understand as\
  \ one would think.  Here we were Gaudi, the sea , only 15 days in our trip and no\
  \ plans ahead. Where next? Valencia, the city it's a bit plane but if you love paella\
  \ this is the place to be, we were lucky to arrive there just for the local rice\
  \ party, we met new people and became good friends, we got to learn a lot from them,\
  \ understand the different inside culture people have in Spain depending on the\
  \ area, and decided to go ahead with our trip to the next Spain biggest area, Andalucia.\
  \ Granada, the Alhambra and I started to understand flamenco."
