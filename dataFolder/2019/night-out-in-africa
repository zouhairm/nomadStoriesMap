Text: "A few years back, I traveled to South Africa. It had been on my bucket list\
  \ for a long time, and I could not wait to immerse myself in that type of environment.\n\
  \nA story that stands out to me is when I went to a night club in Cape Town. Drinks\
  \ were strong, music was loud, and it was a kickass spot to be hanging out in the\
  \ busiest city in South Africa. Behind us, we could see Table Mountain peaking through\
  \ the clouds. I was outside of a nightclub in South Africa, and it was everything\
  \ I dreamed it would be.\n\nHowever, as I looked closer at the scene outside, two\
  \ things stood out. Mikeel and Anthony, two young black boys, begging in front of\
  \ the nightclub. They couldn\u2019t have been older than 7 and 9. Here they were,\
  \ barefoot, begging customers stepping out of their BMW\u2019s for spare change.\n\
  \nMy heart broke. For many reasons. One: This is a country run by the white man.\
  \ 90% of the citizens in South Africa are black, but only 10% own businesses. It\u2019\
  s a sad way of life. I was still listening to Nirvana when the black people finally\
  \ received their right to vote in 1995.\n\nBehind the two boys, was their mother,\
  \ holding a newborn.\n\nMy heart broke again. This story isn\u2019t the upbeat,\
  \ fun, party in Mykonos adventure, but it will always stick with me. I gave them\
  \ as much cash as i could, some snacks, and then they went on their way. All I could\
  \ think the rest of the night, sipping on my Ketel One and soda, was that they were\
  \ spending their nights begging.\n\nTraveling is a humbling experience. If I had\
  \ an unlimited travel pass, I would never stop traveling. It is one of my passions,\
  \ along with photography and writing, and I would love this opportunity to travel\
  \ with this company!"
