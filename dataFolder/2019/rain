Text: "It's just me and Norvin on our own today. We took the furthest house from the\
  \ school and trundled out here with our hoes and spades. I like working with Norvin\
  \ because he's from the village. He knows everyone. When given refreshements - as\
  \ we always are - he can make neighbourly chat, and I am party to genuine warmth,\
  \ rather than the awkwardness of charity bestowed by strangers. \nAnd since the\
  \ rain came there have been a lot more refreshments. The heavens open, we gather\
  \ our things, and we run for shelter. They are already unstacking plastic chairs\
  \ and pouring coffee for us. We receive gratefully. No neighbourly chat, for we\
  \ are silenced by the rain. I have never known a rain as loud as the rain on a tin\
  \ roof. \nToday, I am breaking the first sweat. Wet earth yields easily to my hoe;\
  \ I clear out rocks and waste as I go. Mother and child watch from the doorway.\
  \ Like others, she seems bemused at our labours, but happy to entertain them from\
  \ the comfort of her chair. After an hour or so, she asks me if I like mandarines.\
  \ I say yes, and she sends the child to find one. Then she resumes her sitting.\
  \ \nThis is largely what poverty consists of, I observe. Sitting. Chairs are important\
  \ in Nicaragua. Better off families have handsome, hand-carved rocking chairs in\
  \ polished cedarwood. Sometimes even children have their own little mecedoras. When\
  \ the sun goes down in the town of Masaya, at around 6pm, they get the mecedoras\
  \ out on the street to rock and watch and greet everyone on their way home from\
  \ a day's work. The rest of the chairs are blue plastic, to be stacked and unstacked\
  \ as needed. \nThere are no mecedoras in this village. This is a volcano-village,\
  \ of dust and sand and smoke. Or it was until the rain came - now it is a village\
  \ of mud. I eye the sky, pregnant with its next downpour, and shout to Norvin, who\
  \ is hoeing vigourously. I see the mother unstacking chairs. She gestures for us\
  \ to come inside, and the sky breaks. We are soaked through instantly.\nInside,\
  \ three plastic chairs just fit side by side. A faded duvet cover acts as a partition\
  \ wall to the bedroom.  The child is wriggling in her mother's lap. And coughing,\
  \ though you cannot hear it. Mother puts on a little television set, and for several\
  \ minutes we all watch cartoon dogs to the beating rain. Then something goes, and\
  \ the set expires. So we watch the rain. \nMother's face is utterly expressionless.\
  \ Mother is about my age. I feel myself reddening, so I look about me, at a shelf\
  \ of plastic utensils and what look like old bottles of medicine. A bucket of toys.\
  \ By my head, there are two gas rings and two tupperware boxes. Through the duvet\
  \ cover, I spy another child sleeping on a bed. And above the bed, a crucifix, several\
  \ posters praising the Lord, and a family photograph. \nFor hours of each day for\
  \ six months a year, there is the numbing silence and destruction of the rain. Roads\
  \ become rivers and roofs fall in. Disease spreads. \nWhen the rain subsides, it\
  \ all crowds back in, the noise and smells and life of this place. Mangoes abound\
  \ on the darkened ground. Burning waste pervades the brief relief of clean air.\
  \ Through the trees, Norvin and I can see a group of Nica volunteers dancing towards\
  \ us, taking photos with their phones, triumphant and wet."
