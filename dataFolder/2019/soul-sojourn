Text: "In the summer of 2018, me and family decided to take a break from the monotonous\
  \ routine of our daily lives! We packed our bags and went to the most exotic place\
  \ we could think of - Lisbon, Portugal! The flight from New York to Lisbon is available\
  \ several times a day, mostly with one stop in between! The round trip fare cost\
  \ us about 5000 US dollars for a family of four. It was the mo th of May when we\
  \ finally landed to start the most awaited vacation of our life! The air smelled\
  \ of grilled lamb and steak (or may be it was just me not having eaten my bland\
  \ flight supper!). Stepping out I could feel the heat and buzz of an always active\
  \ middle-eastern city! People were running in all different directions, all for\
  \ very important reasons it seemed; Women whose bright coloured dresses peeked through\
  \ the ends of burqua gowns and men clad in pastel shades of traditional salwaar-kameez!\
  \ It felt like there was order in the chaos, a way of life that was different from\
  \ my own in the city of New York. They say a New York minute is seven seconds! Here\
  \ the time seemed to stop, only the people were running! The cab driver was a friendly\
  \ man in his forties, cropped military style haircut, long oval face and goatee\
  \ beard. He was wearing a traditional cyan portugese salwar-kameez and flip-flops.\
  \ He welcomed us with a warm smile while taking our luggage to keep in the car trunk.\
  \ \nThe journey from the airport to the Hotel seemed like a journey back in time!\
  \ The street businesses worked at a hasty pace yet with the calm of the 1990s. As\
  \ we drove through the city bazaars, businesses were already half way into their\
  \ hustle and bustle of a busy weekday (Flights are the cheapest on a Wednesday!)"
