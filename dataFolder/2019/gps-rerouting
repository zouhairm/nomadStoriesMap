Text: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014\nI took the one less traveled by,\n\
  And that has made all the difference. \n\n\nThis post is inspired by one of my fave\
  \ poems- The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost. This is basically a page out my diary.\
  \ \n\nI have found myself reflecting on my life up to this point, I don\u2019t know\
  \ what it is about being Twenty five that makes you want to assess your life-and\
  \ I know for a fact it is not just me! It is an unwritten rule that you\u2019re\
  \ supposed to have it all figured out, I mean the whole shebang-love,career, family,\
  \ all of it! There is this unspoken rule that twenty five is supposedly the golden\
  \ age, the peak of your youth and the beginning of \u201Cadulting\u201D that has\
  \ so many of us in a frenzy and feeling like we are sub-par or failures. \n\nI am\
  \ tempted to say that it\u2019s unfair that society expects us to have it all figured\
  \ out but really WHO IS SOCIETY? And how dare he/she/they impose their expectations\
  \ on us! Truth of the matter is that we are all awarded different opportunities\
  \ and/or obstacles in life, what you do with them is totally objective and whatever\
  \ road you choose should not be compared with that of someone who chose differently.\
  \ No doubt that there are some amongst us who have it figured out (whoever you are\
  \ I envy you! Teach me your ways!!) but for the rest of us still in the smog-fest\
  \ trying so hard to breakaway from our youth and blindly walking into adulthood\
  \ I say for as long as we are still pushing through- we haven\u2019t failed! Just\
  \ keep traveling your road or perhaps even reroute."
