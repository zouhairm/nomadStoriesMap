Text: "Dried and Discolored, the flower fell out of the novel. I discontinued cleaning\
  \ the bookshelf and picked up this immortal piece of memories.\n    Somewhere in\
  \ the middle of a strange land, I found a girl who looked like me. Dhiita, she had\
  \ introduced herself to me with a smile that had made me feel home instantly. She\
  \ told me she would love to take me to places that won\u2019t be too tourist one.\
  \ I needed to be at some place alone and calm, so I happily accepted.\n    \u2018\
  I think you a Balinese\u2019, she spoke in her broken English, but better one that\
  \ I had heard earlier experienced. I assured her that I am not and that my origin\
  \ is India. But not just her, anyone could assume me as a Balinese. My face was\
  \ so much similar to them. After living for few days here, I actually started loving\
  \ it too.\n    Back in India, everyone had always teased me about my looks. My tiny\
  \ eyes are definitely not like a Marathi from India. I look completely different\
  \ from everyone else in the relatives, and somewhere I feel stranger in my own clan.\
  \ But in Bali it was different. People smiled to me like I was one of them. Many\
  \ even tried to start a conversation until I told them I wasn\u2019t a Balinese\
  \ and could not understand the language.\n    Dhiita started her scooter and her\
  \ talks. She had that charm that would make anyone comfortable. She told me how\
  \ she loved Bollywood and would watch every possible movie with subtitles. She was\
  \ a big fan of some daily soap actor and when I told her I don\u2019t watch one,\
  \ she convinced me to watch it. \n    From Amitabh Bacchan to Ranbir Kapoor, she\
  \ almost knew every song more fluently then the English she spoke. She stopped her\
  \ scooter at one point and asked me to follow her. The sun was setting down, it\
  \ could be dark any moment. I walked behind her like a curious child follows the\
  \ elder sister. The lane was very narrow and it was a good climb. I could hear the\
  \ heartbeats through every part of my body. Somewhere in my heart, I started doubting\
  \ her intentions and every danger I heard about solo traveling, kept pouring on\
  \ me. \n   After sometime I could hardly hear anything she was speaking; my mind\
  \ made my ears listen to my own thoughts. I saw around, not a single person around.\
  \ What if she has some evil plans for me? I thought. \n    After almost a good walk\
  \ and climb with racing heart, we reached a beautiful place. The sun was setting\
  \ low. The canvas of sky painted in colors which I hardly have seen earlier. She\
  \ sat down on the natural lawn. She told me this was her secret place where she\
  \ goes whenever she felt low. Only locals knew about it and may be that is why it\
  \ was still untouched. I sat next to her and she told me the biggest dream she has\
  \ is visiting India.  About how badly she wants to go for Char- Dham yatra and that\
  \ she wants to have one picture outside the residency of Bollywood stars. \n   \
  \ She told me she works as a receptionist at a small place but dreams of working\
  \ in \u2018Big big\u2019 hotels of Mumbai, someday. We talked about our families,\
  \ jobs, beliefs, choices, likes, dislikes. There was a bond that siblings have.\n\
  \    She picked a flower and placed it behind my ears. \u2018You look Balinese.\
  \ Like Jepun!\u2019, her eyes twinkled and so did the stars. \u2018You here, I go\
  \ Bombay\u2019 said Dhiita. We both laughed and the fear vanished. Even at such\
  \ isolated place, in the darkness, I knew I had sisterly connection with me. \n\
  \    On our way back we sang Bollywood songs while we passed the narrow streets\
  \ of Ubud. Bollywood is dream for everyone, but it is also a bridge of connection.\
  \ And without even knowing it, we exchanged our origins. At least in our conversations,\
  \ we did.\nThe same dried and discolored flower now looked like blooming one to\
  \ me, with the showering of memories!"
