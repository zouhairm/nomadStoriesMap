Text: "I love history. My husband loves to relax and enjoy the sun. This usually results\
  \ in a compromise when we plan our vacations. There will be days when I drag him\
  \ around exploring monuments, checking out museums, and walking through streets\
  \ or taking tours; and then there would be days where I sit reading or sleeping\
  \ under an umbrella while he lies in the sun or swims in the sea. It was always\
  \ a compromise. \n\nThen one day I came across Cumberland Island in a book I was\
  \ reading. The author told the story of the old inn, the owning family\u2019s legacy,\
  \ and the history of this remarkable island. The largest island off the coast of\
  \ Georgia was first home to Native Americans for thousands of years. It was then\
  \ colonized by the Spanish, and later looted by French pirates. Thankfully the French\
  \ left the horses, and there are still many who roam the island today. Confederate\
  \ General\_Robert E. Lee\u2019s father is buried there.The last to own the island\
  \ was the Carnegie family. That Carnegie family. Thomas Carnegie (Andrew\u2019s\
  \ brother) bought it in the 1880\u2019s as a place for the family to vacation for\
  \ the winter. \n\nThe family built estates on the island. There is Plum Orchard\
  \ where tours are offered multiple times a week, and the ruins of Dungeness can\
  \ be viewed but not entered, and then there is Greyfield. The Greyfield Inn is open\
  \ today, a beautifully kept mansion that now rents 15 rooms for a minimum two-night\
  \ stay. It is the only inn on the island, and it is still privately owned by descendants\
  \ of the Carnegie family. \n\nWe drove to Amelia Island in Florida and were picked\
  \ up on the boat The Lucy and taken to the island. On the way we were followed by\
  \ a dolphin. I was already seeing some of the wildlife I had spent months eagerly\
  \ anticipating. \n\nSince the early 1970\u2019s the island has been designated a\
  \ national seashore and is protected. This has helped the local wildlife flourish.\
  \ In my four short days on the island I was treated to the sights and sounds of\
  \ wild horses, armadillos, boars, a bobcat, skink, turkey vultures, horseshoe crabs,\
  \ alligators, and many beautiful birds I will never remember the name of. While\
  \ I did not see any snakes (though I was told about the few venomous breeds on the\
  \ island) I was able to see their tracks in the sand on an early morning walk with\
  \ a naturalist.  \n\nThe rooms did not have televisions and there was no pool. The\
  \ whole point of coming to Cumberland Island is to spend your time outdoors seeing,\
  \ breathing, and feeling the island. While I was taking in the beauty and the history\
  \ my husband was by my side, relaxing in the sun. It was truly the only vacation\
  \ where we both got exactly what we wanted, while having completely separate vacations,\
  \ side by side. He swam in the ocean while I combed the seashore looking for shells,\
  \ and shark teeth. I mostly found little maco shark teeth but it wasn\u2019t entirely\
  \ uncommon, I\u2019d been told, to find the teeth of great whites, and, albeit rarely,\
  \ megalodon teeth. Just last year someone found a woolly mammoth molar on the shore.\
  \ \n\nIn the afternoons between lunch and dinner there would be tours offered. This\
  \ was part of the appeal. We were driven for almost an hour, mostly along the shoreline,\
  \ in a white Ford pick-up to the North End where we were given a tour of the rest\
  \ of the island and told more of the history. This was what I had been waiting for.\
  \ We were led inside the church where John F. Kennedy Jr. had married Carolyn Bessette\
  \ in 1996. \n\nTo have days to wander and enjoy an island with such a rich history\
  \ was a truly incredible experience. Native Americans, Spanish settlers, French\
  \ Pirates, American Tycoons, African-American slaves, and finally America\u2019\
  s royalty, the Kennedy\u2019s have all left their mark on a beautiful island rich\
  \ in wildlife, flora, and most importantly, according to some, sun all year round."
