Text: "While memories of being three years old for most people may include clouded\
  \ images of messy paint drawings or rambunctious sand-pit dwellings, for me, being\
  \ three marked the origin of my very first memory\u2014sitting in the plush back\
  \ seat of our family car and looking up with wandering eyes to the slowly swaying\
  \ palm trees that greeted me at the entrance of our home in Haiti. For the year\
  \ that my family and I spent in Haiti as a toddler, life for me was a medley of\
  \ sweet adventures of mischievous games of hide-and-seek with my friends and basking\
  \ in the inviting Caribbean sun. This colorful time period in my childhood would\
  \ forever be etched in my mind and I spent the years yearning to return to my \u201C\
  Ayiti Ch\xE9rie\u201D. The opportunity finally came in the end of 2015 when our\
  \ family friends who lived in Port-Au-Prince invited me, a sophmore New York college\
  \ student at the time, to join them for their New Year celebrations. I was a bundle\
  \ of excited nerves on the plane ride over as I blissfully left the subzero temperatures\
  \ in New York City, to then be peering down through the window of my plane seat\
  \ down at the gleaming turquoise Caribbean waters below. From the cheerful clapping\
  \ that erupted from fellow passengers upon touchdown to the jovial calypso band\
  \ that played in the arrivals hall, a sense of calm settled in my spirit comfortably\
  \ and said to me, \u201Cwelcome home\u201D. I had always wondered why my childhood\
  \ memories in Haiti, though brief, were always so vivid. Though I, of Senegalese\
  \ and Cameroonian origin, was not Haitian myself, I had always felt a sense of pride\
  \ about it. A responsibility that I carried fiercely and fearlessly when recounting\
  \ to someone about how \u201CI used to live in Haiti when I was younger\u201D (often\
  \ times to shocked faces who could not believe that Haiti and \u201Cbeauty\u201D\
  \ could be synonymous). This trip saw me embrace the chaos and vibrance that envelopes\
  \ this beautiful Caribbean nation. As our family friends picked me up from the airport,\
  \ I found myself relishing in each thud and drop in the car as we drove through\
  \ the city\u2019s often unpaved, mountaneous roads. It was the 31st of December\
  \ and you could nearly taste and feel the excited New Years celebratory rush that\
  \ was racing through the city. While the first of January is celebration enough,\
  \ New Years Day has sentimental meaning to all Haitians as it marks their independence\
  \ day and their feat at becoming the world\u2019s first free black nation. That\
  \ evening, once we all got dressed to the nines (under the careful tutelage of my\
  \ auntie Nathalie), we headed over to her in-laws house which was the chosen location\
  \ of the night\u2019s festivities. We came upon a grand, multi-colored house which\
  \ bore a historicly rustic guise and were greeted by an affectionate elderly woman\
  \ that everyone called \u201CGrandm\xE9re\u201D .\u201CSak pase Ndey?\u201D was\
  \ a common Haitian greeting that I received throughout the night and I was comforted\
  \ to see how generously I was being received into a \u201Cfamily\u201D that I had\
  \ just met. The night was young and, while we all sat around conversing in delight\
  \ sipping on sweet Haitian rum cocktails and feasting on an assortment of Haitian\
  \ delicacies such as \u201CDiri ak djon djon\u201D (black mushroom rice) and \u201C\
  banane pes\xE9e\u201D (pressed ripe plantains), I couldn\u2019t help but notice\
  \ hearing the loud pop and crackles of fireworks setting off in the distance\u2014\
  prefacing the night of celebration ahead of us. \u201CGrandm\xE9re\u201D had called\
  \ everyone into the courtyard to set off fireworks and chant the New Years countdown.\
  \ As I stared at the ticking 11:59 PM time on my phone, I spontaneously broke away\
  \ from the group and stepped outside for a moment of reflection. I felt peace and\
  \ happiness settle in my spirit and tears begin to well up in my eyes. The sense\
  \ of love and community in Haiti had now fully washed over me and as the clock striked\
  \ midnight on New Year\u2019s Day, I breathed a satisfying sigh and whispered under\
  \ my breath, eyes still closed, \u201CI am home\u201D."
