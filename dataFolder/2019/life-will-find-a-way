Text: "I was on a school trip going to Cambodia.  School trips are the worst because\
  \ you are young and comfortably traveling with your friends-making it okay to bring\
  \ your own cultural practices to a foreign place.  \n\nWe landed in all the tourist\
  \ trap, book ended by my very human experience at Ankor Wat.  This story isn't about\
  \ how beautiful traveling and amazing things are.  It's about how things get ugly\
  \ when you travel as an ignorant world citizen.\n\nAs we were returning to our tour\
  \ bus, we were approached by a series of young boys that appear to be begging for\
  \ money.\n\nThere were atleast 4 -5 groups of them, and the walk back took 15 minutes\
  \ more or less.\n\nThey were all types of tough life, missing limbs, young and cute,\
  \ disfigured.  \n\nBefore I got into the bus, my good will resulted in a very regrettable\
  \ outcome.\n\nI dropped the smallest weakest and saddest looking kid a $50 USD.\
  \  It was 1/3 of my allowance at the trip.\n\nAs we pulled out, all 5 groups including\
  \ his own ganged up on him as he curled up into the ball protecting the $50 dollars\
  \ like his life pretended on it.\n\nlet this be a story about the dangers of traveling\
  \ with an ignorant mind and rejecting of other places cultures and practices.  This\
  \ is one of the reasons I enjoy traveling in smaller groups, because its the quality\
  \ of the experience not the quantity or road traveled.\n\nI am a film making producer\
  \ that wants to make travel and film the core of my living.  I seem to be making\
  \ money on one and losing all of it on the other end.  I would love to share a travel\
  \ experience with you and your crew."
