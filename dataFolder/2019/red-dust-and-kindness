Text: "Red dust rising underfoot, clinging to the tops of socks and backs of legs,\
  \ coating the throats of those who follow. \nIt\u2019s eight in the morning, the\
  \ sun rose an hour ago and there are walkers, like me, already far ahead on the\
  \ path. I\u2019ve already caught up with Fiona and Russell who I met at a campsite\
  \ in Uluru. We\u2019ve followed each other here by chance, last night we sheltered\
  \ from a sudden downpour under the same awning of their caravan. I\u2019ll stick\
  \ with them, loosely, on this trek around the King\u2019s Canyon, through the oasis\
  \ in the middle and the sheer drops on one side of a path well-trodden. \nA week\
  \ before I was in Charleville, Queensland, heading south, finishing my solo road\
  \ trip by following the path of lyrics from a country singer \u2018been through\
  \ Rome and Charleville it can\u2019t be far away\u2019 I never made it to Cunnamulla.\
  \ A chance encounter in a caravan park sent me back this way. \n\u2018Why wait?\u2019\
  \ He said, brown skin and Akubra hat, showing me photos on a laptop of his trip\
  \ a few weeks ago. \u2018It\u2019s the best time of year right now.\u2019 So off\
  \ I headed back North, to Mt Isa, a change of tyres, a hasty purchase of a camp\
  \ stove and tent and turn left at the intersection to journey down the middle of\
  \ Australia. \nThe people you meet out here on the road are, more often than not,\
  \ a reminder of the kindness humanity has to offer. I\u2019ve been fed and even\
  \ sheltered by complete strangers, welcomed to the table at free camp sites, regaled\
  \ with stories of desert trekking and country roads. They\u2019re the reminders\
  \ I needed when I set out on this self-guided trip in my little red hatchback. Reminders\
  \ of what the world can offer if you feel like giving it a go. \nSitting on top\
  \ of King\u2019s Canyon watching a lizard, watching the people around me take in\
  \ the view, feeling the heat in the sun and my muscles aching, knowing there\u2019\
  s more to go before the end."
