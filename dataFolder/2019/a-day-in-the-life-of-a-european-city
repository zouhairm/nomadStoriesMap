Text: "\u201CA mind stretched by new experience can never go back to its old dimensions\u201D\
  \n\nEven with my humble travels, this quote resonates truth about my own life. I\
  \ have travelled around some African countries, Thailand and have been to the United\
  \ Arab Emirates several times, but what stands out more for me was when I had to\
  \ reside in the United Kingdom for several months.\n\nIn 2017, I was selected to\
  \ be a part of an International Professional Exchange Program in the United Kingdom.\
  \ I had an embarrassingly low knowledge of the country that when I was informed\
  \ that I would be living in a city called Sheffield, I raided my cupboard to find\
  \ my Atlas, with the hopes of getting an idea of where I was heading to. This sounded\
  \ more and more like a quantum leap. \n\nBefore my departure, I learnt that it was\
  \ Spring in the UK. For us South Africans; the Spring season is fresh, still a bit\
  \ breezy but very warm during the day. I guess I got lost in translation because\
  \ what greeted me upon arrival in the UK was beyond freezing, I have never in my\
  \ life experienced the kind of chill that seeps through your bones, like lava. I\
  \ was even more amazed to witness a country-looking City of Manchester, I would\
  \ see sheep grazing from afar, I soon learnt that most of the country was that way,\
  \ but moulded by modern bulidings and stores. I received  warm welcomes from people\
  \ working at the airport and train station. They were especially fascinated by what\
  \ I was wearing in the cold weather. I kept acting confident and as comfortable\
  \ as possible, but my body kept failing me; with my fingers shivering uncontrollably\
  \ while my nose was turning purple every second and warm waters kept sipping through\
  \ my nostrils. I had to buy two coats which became my shelter throughout my stay\
  \ in the country. \n\nAs the days went by, I swiftly learnt the culture and cousine\
  \ of the British. The food is rich and would often become my solace whenever I felt\
  \ lonely. Every other day, I\u2019d travel to cities near and far. Although I am\
  \ an introvert by nature, I had to get out of my shell and speak more often to the\
  \ locals, lest I catch the wrong train or bus. Some of them knew the story of Africa,\
  \ others were more precise and would often ask how the apartheid regime has affected\
  \ South Africa to date. Sometimes we\u2019d have a language barrier, it was hard\
  \ for me to grasp the accent of the British, especially because it differed from\
  \ region to region. \nI would attend events in Leeds, London and Manchester. In\
  \ between I\u2019d have to de-tour into other towns like Chesterfield, Liverpool,\
  \ Leicester and Derby. Cities I\u2019ve ever only heard of on the television, during\
  \ soccer leagues or in my childhood days. I\u2019d often get nostalgic remembering\
  \ my late father smoking cigarettes called Chesterfield, little did I know it was\
  \ named after this town in the UK and that one day I\u2019d be walking a mile in\
  \ its streets.\n\nMy hours in Europe were fleeting and the nights were often a wonder.\
  \ I would be fascinated by the sun that sets at 10:30 pm. That was unknown to me,\
  \ it was as if the gods were playing tricks with my mind, but with every discovery\
  \ I made, I felt like a puppy experiencing something new every day.\n\nEven though\
  \ it\u2019s been almost 2 years since my European experience, I still have plenary\
  \ memories that often pop up in my mind. I have never been the same since then.\
  \ I\u2019m more understanding and accommodating of other personalities. It\u2019\
  s fascinating to know that something in me has shifted for the good. \nWith these\
  \ new experiences, came the realization that even though i\u2019m proudly African,\
  \ I now know for sure that my heart belongs everywhere."
