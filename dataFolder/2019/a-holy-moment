Text: "A Holy Moment\nThe soldiers gathered the scattered pieces of their uniforms,\
  \ grim expressions painting their faces. A thick silence hung in the air, begging\
  \ to be heard. No one was speaking, and no one could blame us. Our hearts were heavy\
  \ with the knowledge of what we were about to experience: The Western Wall. \n\n\
  Jerusalem had been good to us thus far, the white stone gleaming under our footsteps\
  \ and the views as breathtaking as the Google images. The walls were white, as was\
  \ the whole city. The color of purity, beginning, beauty, juxtaposed with the ancient\
  \ city filled with past strife. \n\nThe beauty drew me in as the bus carried me\
  \ closer. My eyes roamed over old bullet holes, holding onto memories of forced\
  \ entry. The bus driver stopped, and we were strongly encouraged to adorn our modest\
  \ clothing. Piling into the bathroom stalls, I changed with the other girls, feeling\
  \ my jeans stick to my legs in protest. I draped my shawl over my bare shoulders\
  \ and lowered my head in humble modesty as we entered the premises. We filed in,\
  \ following other groups of tourists from all over the world, here to pay their\
  \ respects. Israeli families passed by, wearing traditional, modest clothes. I set\
  \ my purse into a box, along with anything else I had on my person, and stepped\
  \ through the metal detector. Urged to go through, I followed my group to the entrance\
  \ of the Western Wall. \n\nMy breath caught, and I was taken aback. All was unexpectedly\
  \ tranquil. Israeli flags hung in the air, and the sun shone down, coaxing a sparkling\
  \ smile from the tile. I noticed the disparity within the wall; the men\u2019s section\
  \ to pray was approximately three-quarters of the entire wall. The women\u2019s\
  \ side only a tightly packed quarter, with waiting bodies. \n\nI watched in earnest\
  \ as Jewish women bowed several times over, tears falling as they walked backward\
  \ away from the wall. \u201CWe are told not to turn our back to the wall, to the\
  \ service our relatives provided to our families and our country.\u201D Hadar, an\
  \ Israeli soldier of twenty years old informed me. I nodded, feeling suddenly very\
  \ out of place. How could I stand there, letting tears well in my eyes and sadness\
  \ weigh on my chest when I wasn\u2019t directly affected? I felt fraudulent, but\
  \ soothed my own worries, knowing I was paying respect to my culture. That was enough.\
  \ \n\nFinally, it was my turn to approach the wall. I reached out tentatively and\
  \ placed my hand against the beckoning stone. Smooth. Glossy, even. An array of\
  \ prayers scrawled on bits of tattered paper competed for space. Every now and then\
  \ one fell to the ground, joining many other scraps. I grasped my paper, crumpling\
  \ it nervously. What was I to write? All the emotions of the wall and this day blanketed\
  \ my senses, clouding my brain. I, who was never short of words, had run dry. Time\
  \ passed. Shaky hands scribbled my supplications onto the paper and fruitlessly\
  \ searched for an open crevice. My prayer lay gently against the ground, with others\
  \ waiting to be answered. I started to back away and was surprised by the difficulty\
  \ of such a simple task. \n\nWe joined together under the Israeli flag blowing in\
  \ the gentle wind. My tears dried, and I felt blessed to have experienced such a\
  \ significant religious site. Ariel, another Israeli soldier, gently nudged me.\
  \ Neither of us spoke, our eyes said enough. Others were crying. Some were stoic,\
  \ unyielding to their emotions. \n\nOnce we were outside the wall and closer to\
  \ regaining an emotional equilibrium, the group leader prompted reflective conversation.\
  \ Rather than voice my thoughts, I listened in silence, simply feeling and being.\
  \ \n\nOur group was diverse, consisting of young people from across the United States\
  \ who had come to the birthplace of religion. Not all of us were religious, but\
  \ it didn\u2019t matter. Our humanity did, and I had never felt more human."
