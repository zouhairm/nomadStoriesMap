Text: There are myriad reviews of best places to take a picture of the sign, but let's
  face it the best picture is the one with your loved one's front and center with
  the sign in the background as it's people that make places. So let's go one step
  beyond. You need a permit to "go to the Hollywood sign," and if you get caught you
  may get in trouble but how do you get to the Hollywood sign. First thing if you've
  very young children or very old travelers forget this. For others for whom the naughty
  gene shines brightly, wear hiking clothes, and off we go. North on Beachwood Drive
  from Franklin Avenue, go left on Ledgewood drive and then a right onto Rockcliff
  drive. Go to nearly the end of Rockcliff and turn left on Deronda Drive, ignore
  all signs as the no parking doesn't apply on a weekday and park on Deronda where
  parking is allowed. Walk up Deronda, pass under the white arch and you'll figure
  out your next move. Walk up the paved road Mt.Lee Drive, and you will find yourself
  behind the Hollywood sign. It is said that one could shimmy down and sit on the
  sign and get a very cool picture. I can only tell you what is said, and that the
  pictures turned out great :-) Be careful and have fun.
