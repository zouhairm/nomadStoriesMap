Text: "\u201CIt smells like caramel vomit.\u201D Jeff\u2019s cyanotic nostrils flare\
  \ as we pass a doorway where the musky, milky scent of burning yak butter wafts\
  \ out into the alley. We\u2019ve been in Llhasa for 48 hours, and while my acclimation\
  \ to the altitude has improved, Jeff is plummeting into oxygen-deprived crabbiness.\
  \ \n\nFlying into Llhasa, the capitol of Tibet, means dropping through a ring of\
  \ ancient glacial peaks into an ultra-modern ghost town. The airport is surrounded\
  \ by uninhabited concrete high-rises\u2014a mind-boggling contrast to the ancient\
  \ temples and small villages featured on our tour company\u2019s website. Jeff and\
  \ I rarely travel with tour groups, but Tibet is different. Travel visas can be\
  \ acquired only through official guides, approved by the Chinese government.\n\n\
  The first three tour days are spent in Llhasa\u2019s Old Town, far from the new\
  \ airport construction.  Authentic Tibetan culture still keeps a stronghold here.\
  \ We visit centuries-old monasteries, we explore alleys and markets, but mostly\
  \ we acclimatize to the altitude. The Llhasa plateau, at 12,000 feet above sea level,\
  \ is often called the roof of the world. Our van of travelers will go higher yet,\
  \ including Mt. Everest base camp at over 17,000 feet.\n\nWe move slowly through\
  \ Old Town, not from a lack of oxygen but simply to absorb the abundance of color,\
  \ scents and sounds. We walk Barkhor Street, the pedestrian artery curving around\
  \ Jokhong Temple, the heart of Tibetan Buddhism. Clusters of devout Tibetans circumambulate\
  \ the temple, always clockwise. Many spin prayer wheels and chant mantras, some\
  \ inch forward by prostrations, and all move toward enlightenment. Giant clay ovens\
  \ burn incense, and yes, yak butter lamps fill the air with a distinctive hint of\
  \ burnt caramel. \n\nAltitude sickness is unpredictable. Jeff and I live at 3600\
  \ feet in our hometown of Bend, Oregon, and regularly hike at altitudes over 9000\
  \ feet. We expected to acclimate quickly, because we are mountain people, dammit!\
  \ Yet Jeff is not his cheery, energetic self. His heart races, his head pounds,\
  \ he breathes irregularly, and he\u2019s wide awake, all night long.\n\nThe next\
  \ morning we tour the Potala, home of the Dalai Lama. Towering white walls and stairways\
  \ seem to erupt straight out of the mountain. Inside, we climb tight stairways up\
  \ to the balcony where decades ago he studied the moon through his telescope. We\
  \ pass through ornate rooms, where advisors planned his escape from the Chinese\
  \ army. The palace hums with monks of all ages, despite the exile of their leader.\n\
  \nInside the Jokhong Temple that afternoon, breathtaking shrines are laden with\
  \ gold and gems, but I\u2019m struck by the thousands of tiny offerings\u2014small\
  \ bills and candy tucked into every crevice. Our guide gently explains, \u201CA\
  \ gift of water is just as valuable as gold, if the intention is pure.\u201D He\
  \ smiles patiently. \u201COne cannot buy goodness.\u201D\n\nWe head to Makye Ame,\
  \ a cozy second floor restaurant, for tsampa soup and yak stew with our tour group.\
  \ Most hail from coastal cities, but were feeling fine. They\u2019d all been taking\
  \ Diamox, a prescription drug that minimizes altitude sickness. One person offers\
  \ Jeff some Diamox, but adds \u201CIt only works if you start several days before\
  \ travelling. Sorry\u2026\u201D \n\nAfter another sleepless night, we visit the\
  \ Sera monastery for the monks\u2019 daily debate on the finer points of Buddhism.\
  \ It\u2019s a raucous event. Dozens of monks fill the courtyard, presenting their\
  \ questions with a high kick and a loud clap. Other monks sit quietly, answering\
  \ challenges, until they change positions. This would be my favorite part of the\
  \ day, if I were a monk. Jeff is twitchy, in need of a quiet escape.\n\nWe duck\
  \ into the cool, dark Shambhala Hotel bar, a rare spot in Old Town with cold beer.\
  \ I notice his lips look slightly blue, and realize it\u2019s time to rethink this\
  \ trip. Do we continue on to the highest corners of the roof of the world? If Jeff\
  \ gets worse, the whole group must turn around.\n\nOur guides arrange flights back\
  \ to oxygen-rich Beijing, where Jeff quickly feels better. Before we leave, I tuck\
  \ a coin into the temple wall, grateful for even three days in this rich and beautiful\
  \ place."
