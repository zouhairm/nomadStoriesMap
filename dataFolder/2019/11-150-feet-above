Text: "\u2018Rapido! Rapido!\u2019 yells our guide at the short man driving the Daihatsu\
  \ through the narrow cobblestoned streets of central Cusco. In the backseat: exhaust\
  \ fumes funnel through rust holes in the floor as the car accelerates into oncoming\
  \ traffic. Our Moses-ian driver sounds the horn and the cars part before us. The\
  \ wheel is spun to the left and we cross non-existent lanes onto a street that runs\
  \ along the neck of the geoglyph jaguar the city is built over and around. Now at\
  \ the tail, the car pulls to a halt before the double doors of the hospital. Two\
  \ doctors wait for us. Salcantay\u2019s peak rips the pale blue sky in two. Our\
  \ driver places a hand on my shoulder and offers a prayer.\n\n*\n\nCusco sits in\
  \ the zone between \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018very high\u2019 altitudes at 11,150\
  \ ft. At this height the amount of oxygen in the air is roughly half that of sea-level,\
  \ and stepping from the small plane that took us from the city of Lima to the Incan\
  \ capital, you could immediately feel the change. Walking across the tarmac led\
  \ to shortness of breath, my body not yet acclimatised and my chest tight with anxiety\
  \ at our reason for being there, and the reason for my first trip outside of Australia.\n\
  Four days beforehand my aunt, on holidays in South America developed altitude sickness\
  \ somewhere between Puno and Cusco which progressed to acute mountain sickness and\
  \ finally High Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE). We (my father and I) were there\
  \ to sign paperwork allowing the doctors to remove life-support. \nWe arrive in\
  \ Cusco on the second day. Are led to the hospital where we are met by a doctor\
  \ who is also a model and rides a Harley to work helmetless to allow his long, dark\
  \ hair to flow behind him. \u2018It may take overnight,\u2019 he tells us and no\
  \ context is needed.  \nMy father returns to the hotel and I take time to wander\
  \ the dusty streets of the old city. Dogs, mud clumped and eager, wander the lanes\
  \ and roads. Workmen in flip-flops use heavy machinery, while others lean ladders\
  \ against the powerlines that hang like ivy off building still affected by an earthquake\
  \ years before. Colonial structures are built on top of the Incan foundations like\
  \ a bad metaphor.\nI step across the threshold of what appears to be a restaurant.\
  \ In Lima my Spanish is acceptable, but here among the mountains that are still\
  \ worshipped the guttural dialect and frequent mashing of the Indigenous Quechuan\
  \ with old world Spanish leaves me ignorant, but between hand gestures and broken\
  \ language I order. \nThe hospitality of the Incan descendants is natural. Immediately\
  \ I am brought a Pisco Sour and a bowl of roasted corn kernels while I wait for\
  \ my meal. A woman sits and speaks to me and while we can barely understand one\
  \ another, to her it is clear that there is something amiss. We speak for a few\
  \ minutes, and when my soup arrives she leaves me to my own thoughts. When I am\
  \ finished slurping in my horrible manner, coca tea is brought over. A traditional\
  \ method of alleviating altitude sickness. There are some tears as I sip.\nBack\
  \ at the hotel, the tour manager for the company my aunt was travelling with asks\
  \ a question. Would we like to see Macchu Picchu? My father, silent and unable to\
  \ fully comprehend, babbles nothings. I answer, \u2018yes\u2019. \nThe next morning\
  \ my aunt dies, and for all the screaming of our guide urging the taxi faster through\
  \ the streets, we are too late to be there with her. Her hands are still warm when\
  \ we enter the room. A day later we are in Macchu Picchu, of which too much has\
  \ already been written for me to add more.\nBut as we leave, an Indigenous woman\
  \ who has shown us through the site; and who has heard the story of Erinne, my aunt,\
  \ says \u2018wait a moment.\u2019 She runs back through the gates and grabs some\
  \ soil and stones. \u2018Place these with her when she goes,\u2019 she says. \n\
  And a piece of that sacred valley is now part of the ashes."
