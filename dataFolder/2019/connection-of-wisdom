Text: "Wandering off to go for a walk on her own wasn't an unusual stubborn attitude\
  \ she had. Mastering to emotionally check up on herself frequently became a tool\
  \ of adult navigation.\n\nThere was something pleasantly refreshing on this walk.\
  \ She managed to get few minutes to herself to try catch the sunset and write a\
  \ bit of poetry about her summer holiday in Nairobi. Being back home after so long\
  \ felt emotionally overwhelming and the whole purpose of this trip was to maintain\
  \ a journal of emotional experiences.\n\nJacaranda avenue was a gated estate filled\
  \ with up high market homes that were all strictly secured, the opposite to her\
  \ home back in London , a small 2 bedroom flat that she shared with her partner.\n\
  \nThe best part of being back besides seeing all her nieces and nephews grown up\
  \ was the smell of the concrete after it rained in Nairobi. \n\nEnjoying the essence\
  \ of the jacaranda petals all along the pathway and the sounds of the birds was\
  \ somewhat unfamiliar anymore but refreshingly a peaceful escape.\n\nShe saw a white\
  \ man walking towards her with a fitted cap. As he got closer, she noticed he was\
  \ a celtic fan, such familiarity only stood out because it was close to where she\
  \ called home. He turns out to be an Irish descendant that has lived in Nairobi\
  \ for 50years.\n\nAs she carries on with her afternoon journal, she frequently started\
  \ bumping into him and having a catch up about all the wonders relating to social\
  \ affairs. The more they bumped into each other the more they realised how much\
  \ in common they had.\nThey both were celtic fans in different context, her partner\
  \ was of a scottish descendant and so his celtic cap was close to home and matched\
  \ the green and white jersey she brought along in her suitcase. He also knew more\
  \ about her than the place she was originally raised in as a child. \n\nThe on going\
  \ exchange of such wisdom through afternoon walks turned into genuine warmth of\
  \ friendship. He would frequently catch up with her in regards to her writing and\
  \ she would go on and on about issues concerning the Somali diaspora and how accumulating\
  \ different cultures while maintaining your origins can sometimes come with marginalization\
  \ and consistent battle of labels. She felt refreshed to come across someone that\
  \ aligned her perspective of systematic separation between nations and how all the\
  \ toxic affiliations is passed on generation after generation. The way we live in\
  \ an era where the main concern of our historical point as a human race is becoming\
  \ the portrait of indulgence of vanity, military basis and incomparable spread of\
  \ the use of wealth and currency.\n\nBeing born in mogadishu, raised in Nairobi\
  \ until the age of 8 and migrating to live in a little country side town in england\
  \ meant her lense of perspective in correlation to the ground reality that some\
  \ people unfortunately call life was sheltered most of her life. Going back in your\
  \ adulthood to a place you once called home as a child adds a whole different narrative.\n\
  \nIt wasn't a stubborn afternoon walk to try get away from a busy house hold of\
  \ family guest members that she barely knew, or from making an expected sweet shaax\
  \ with lots of cinnamon flavours, somali tea usually prepared in a huge pot to serve\
  \ the finest of the most judgemental guests you can have in your presence.\n\nLiving\
  \ across different cultures and countries always aids to knowledge of real experiences.\
  \ She quickly learnt that she had far more in common with an Irish man living in\
  \ Nairobi than people she had maternal relatives with."
