Text: "India, Afghanistan and I. \nI had always dreamt of a foreign experience. I\
  \ considered that if I had known people from foreign countries, it would be as if\
  \ I had visited them. That spring, I found what it really means to discover the\
  \ culture of a foreign nation, and to identify their history.\nWe were three friends.\
  \ It was such an awesome thing that we could find things of such great value in\
  \ such simple places.\nThat morning, together with India and Afghanistan, we were\
  \ going to take on the prize jewel of Potsdam. The sun shone with great beauty and\
  \ the serenity of the sky was a clear sign that we would enjoy the day. \n\u201C\
  How are you?\u201D asked India and Afghanistan . I answered only with a smile. \
  \ The train was filled with an unusual noise, which made it difficult for me to\
  \ get to know them better. Then I remembered the old game from my childhood. \n\u201C\
  Would you like to play a game?\u201D I asked them. \u201CIt is nothing difficult.\
  \ All we have to do is to prepare a set of questions and reply them. I would go\
  \ first\u201D, I concluded.\nLooking through the window of the train, I saw in front\
  \ of me, through the glimpses of the eyes, towns, villages and an endless number\
  \ of green trees. Suddenly a surge of hankering overtook me. \n\u201CWhat is the\
  \ most joyous memory you have of your childhood?\u201D I asked.\n\u201CI remember\
  \ there were days when I did not want to go to school. I was 12 years old at the\
  \ time. For this reason, I planned to lie about having stomach ache. I did not go\
  \ to school for a day or two until I was caught by my parents. I was beaten to within\
  \ an inch of my life. When I remember it now, the memory seemed very funnyage and\
  \ serene to me, which has its little space in my soul,\u201D told India. \n\u201C\
  And you, Afghanistan?\u201D\n\u201CI used to skip school. Instead of going to school,\
  \ I would go to a nearby building with a play room full of toys and gadgets. I stayed\
  \ there until tonight, lying to my dad that I was doing my homework with one of\
  \ my friends. But I was caught and I am afraid you do not want to know what happened\
  \ after,\u201D smiled he. \u201CAnyway, I never did it again as it was a dangerous\
  \ thing to cross my dad. He was a strict man,\u201D he said sarcastically. I burst\
  \ out laughing.\n It was astonishing to talk to somebody and to share the most sacred\
  \ memories of the soul. India and Afghanistan belong to such different cultures\
  \ but nevertheless we were able to become friends, who would understand our own\
  \ silence.  The new and the foreign beside me helped me free the unconscious. \n\
  So simple people, with physical features looking no different from mine. Three religions,\
  \ three faces and three worlds had become friends. From time to time, my eyes were\
  \ attracted by the crowd in the train. So different were they. Somebody was coming\
  \ to us with too much luggage, trying to find a place. Behind me, a lady was trying\
  \ to calm her crying child. Through the window, I saw a man involved in such a deep\
  \ conversation that while he was entering the train, he forgot his colored blouse\
  \ on the bench in the station. Each of them had their own living story, belonging\
  \ only to them.\nThe train hastened its pace, which activated our inner freedom,\
  \ of finding peace in the midst of this eternal human race. The enchantment of the\
  \ journey of this numb spring filled my soul with a steadyjoy. We had discovered\
  \ that the spirit opened even more widely amongst aliens. The desire to know another\
  \ country through its inhabitants and to appreciate the moment of identity whose\
  \ form unites and differentiates at the same time, made me think of the continual\
  \ transformation of who we were and whom we met into blaze.\n \u201CSo, what\u2019\
  s the next question?\u201D I smiled."
