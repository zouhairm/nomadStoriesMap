Text: "We lurch to a halt, brakes squealing.  The sliding van door flies open and\
  \ in climbs a woman dressed in a bright red, knee-length fur coat and matching tan\
  \ fur hat.  She spies an open seat in the back and sashays towards it on sky-high\
  \ stiletto boots.  Over in the corner a man in a leather jacket and ill-fitting\
  \ jeans closes his eyes and nurses a Baltika beer. It is a frosty Monday morning\
  \ in Saint Petersburg, Russia and I am on my way to school via the most colorful\
  \ means of local transport:  the marshrutka, from the Russian word marshrut, meaning\
  \ route.  Passengers can hail these rickety yellow taxi vans anywhere along their\
  \ fixed route but you will not find a route map or schedule for marshrutkas posted\
  \ anywhere in the city.  As with many things in this country, you just have to know.\n\
  Daily life in Russia can be frustrating, strange and absurd.  My grueling hour and\
  \ a half (one way) daily commute is no exception.  As one of my professors had remarked\
  \ earlier in the semester:  \u201Cyou need two things to live in Russia:  a sense\
  \ of humor and a boatload of patience.\u201D  I remembered his words earlier this\
  \ morning as I waited on the icy street corner attempting to hail my ride.  Not\
  \ one, but two marshrutkas had passed me by, already full.  My luck changed when\
  \ number three wheezed around the corner and sputtered to a stop in front of my\
  \ outstretched arm.  As I boarded the driver announced to all who would listen that\
  \ the door was to be closed nezhno, gently, lest it fall of its tracks.  Yes, these\
  \ old bruisers had seen better days but the Russian people have learned to make\
  \ the best of what they have.\nI had only a 500 ruble note and a one-way ride costs\
  \ 24 rubles (about 1 USD at the time).  I would need change.  \u201CPeredayte pozhaluysta,\u201D\
  \ I said to the babushka who sat next to me, asking her to pass my money up to the\
  \ driver.  When my 500 ruble note reached him he gave me a dirty look in the rearview\
  \ mirror.  I have learned the hard way that Russians hate breaking large bills!\
  \  He grumbled a bit and fished around for my change in the center console.  It\
  \ was returned in the same manner, passing from person to person until it landed\
  \ back in my hands.  I counted it.  Correct, as always.  The marshrutka driver is\
  \ an impressive multitasker.  He must watch for new passengers, listen for stop\
  \ requests, collect money and make change, talk on his cell phone, honk at other\
  \ drivers, and beg passengers not to slam that door!  He does all this while careening\
  \ around the city as fast as its brutal traffic will allow.  \nNow I peer out my\
  \ grimy window as the Neva River meanders into view.  Throughout the so-called \u201C\
  white nights\u201D of the summer solstice the sun never sets; the river banks teem\
  \ with revelers drinking away the bright night.  Today however, the Neva is silent,\
  \ brooding, slate gray.  Jagged ice chunks float sluggishly along the current, given\
  \ up to the sea upon reaching the Gulf of Finland.  These are the dark days of winter\
  \ and a frozen melancholy hangs in the air as the city and its denizens wait patiently\
  \ for spring\u2019s thaw.   \nAfter two students get off across from Saint Petersburg\
  \ State University we join a bottleneck of cars waiting to cross over the Palace\
  \ Bridge into the city center.  The Baroque Winter Palace stretches majestically\
  \ along the far bank of the Neva.  The morning sun hangs low on the eastern horizon\
  \ bathing the mint green palace in anemic December light.  \nFinally we cross over\
  \ the bridge and zip down Nevsky Prospect, the city\u2019s main arterial.  We are\
  \ nearing my school, Smolny Institute so I call out for a stop and as I exit I remember\
  \ to close the door gently.  As I pass by, I look up at the ornate cerulean blue\
  \ facade of Smolny Cathedral, its graceful onion domes reaching into the heavens.\
  \  It is a new day in this fascinating, maddening, beautiful city of darkness and\
  \ light."
