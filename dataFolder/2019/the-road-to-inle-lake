Text: "Jet lag infused insomnia plagued my days in Bangkok, the crushing humidity\
  \ didn\u2019t help either and while most of this was gone by the time I got to Chiang\
  \ Mai I was still convinced to avoid going back there. I cancelled my flight back\
  \ to the capital and decided to follow the girls, Luisa and Victoria, to Yangon.\n\
  \ \nI looked out the window, holding my crumbled printed visa I did the day before,\
  \ and saw the beautiful golden Pagoda as we landed into the city with the afternoon\
  \ sun. A smile filled my face. I was finally touching a land that months before\
  \ I included and then, based on fears of the strict government, I reluctantly removed\
  \ and everything just because I asked the girls on facebook the day before about\
  \ the price of the visa and turned into an offer to travel with them. I guess you\
  \ can\u2019t never truly fight the call from some places.\n \nI waited on the bus\
  \ station for hours, the smells (good and bad) overloaded my senses and the constant\
  \ noises and voices filled me with an excitement no other place has managed before.\
  \ At 5pm the taxi arrived with Vicky and Luisa, and soon after we were on our way\
  \ to the real destination, the city of Kalaw.\n \nSitting on the roof of our hotel\
  \ in Kalaw, drinking yerba mate with an oddly homogenous group of Argentinians,\
  \ the 5 of us watched under the refreshing night drizzle how the lights of the whole\
  \ city went off and then, first the big hotels and then (or maybe never) the small\
  \ houses started to light up again. And so the sequence repeated itself a few more\
  \ times, as if the lack of a proper electric system would transform into something\
  \ more special just for us.\n \nOur guide, for the following 40 km, was a young\
  \ girl with an incredible smile. Burmese people smile all the time but hers was\
  \ perfect, and all that young innocence was completed by a naivety in the most normal\
  \ things, or at least what we consider normal. Sitting on an immense rice field\
  \ cornered by mountains and with a silence only interrupted by our voices and the\
  \ bells of the cows, she would ask (after a short explanation of how you get robbed\
  \ in southamerica) if they used real guns or if they would actually shoot you for\
  \ a cellphone. We laughed at her naive ideas, how would you don\u2019t know that?\
  \ how could you be so unaware of the dangers around?\n \nThe night on the monastery\
  \ was calm, the cats ran around the place and the bathrooms (if you can call them\
  \ that) were full of spiders but the Milky Way was shining with a glow new to me,\
  \ the Southern Cross standing upright was an even stranger sight. After counting\
  \ 4 shooting stars I went back to bed.\n \nIn the second day of the walk we reached\
  \ a village and as our guide talked about the $6 per day the basket makers make,\
  \ I looked at the children running around with a Wallace and Gromit kite, they don\u2019\
  t have TVs or even electricity for that matter, they don\u2019t know who Wallace\
  \ and Gromit are. And the children played and smiled happily running between cows\
  \ and bamboo plants, asking Vicky for sweets in hopes she will pull something out\
  \ of her backpack. I couldn\u2019t avoid to listen to the constant coughing between\
  \ the house, I doubt tuberculosis has been eradicated here.\n \nThe boat through\
  \ Inle Lake proved to be a high note at the end of our walk, the blue water only\
  \ rivalled by the bluest sky. Floating plantations of tomatoes broke the uniform\
  \ colour that almost blended all the elements with the mountains some kilometres\
  \ away.\n \nNearing the village on the lake, flimsy wooden houses raised besides\
  \ sturdy brick hotels, all floating in the lake. Bridges that joined houses and\
  \ little piers where children and adults alike bathe with soap and shampoo and women\
  \ washed clothes. It was here again where we saw the sweet smile of the Burmese\
  \ children enjoying their bath on the lake under the sun."
