  \ to different places, different countries hoping to interact with the Locals and\
  \ experience firsthand its cultures without realizing that there are more to enjoy\
  \ in their locality than spending the entire savings account on a days travel.\n\
  \nMy last travel to Philippines was an amazing, fun, yet an unforgettable one. I\
  \ have been living  there my whole entire life and have not got the chance to travel\
  \ more of its Tourist Destinations. It was a dream come true and a fun-filled experience.\
  \ \n\nCebu. I was born, raised and a local from the Northern part of Cebu. The Southern\
  \ part was always my dream to escape. Without an itinerary in-hand, I wander around\
  \ the Southern part with a friend and was mesmerized by the Natural Beauty it has\
  \ to offer. \n\nHere are some of the \"must-do\" in the Southern part of Cebu:\n\
  \n1. Climb Cebu's Osme\xF1a Peak - Manloray, Dalaguete, Cebu, Phil.\n When you start\
  \ hiking early in the morning, prepare to embrace the cold temperature as it fogs.\
  \ By the time you reached the top, the sun has rise and you'll instantly fall in\
  \ love to Cebu's hidden gem.\n2. Vegetable Plantation - Dalaguete, Cebu, Phil.\n\
  \ Tagged as the vegetable basket of Cebu, a wide range of vegetable plantation can\
  \ be spotted here. Most of the vegetables seen here are lettuce, carrots, cabbages,\
  \ and a lot more.\n3. Swim with the huge and friendly whale sharks and millions\
  \ of sardines - Oslob, Cebu, Phil\n This experience is a must. Whale sharks are\
  \ present in Oslob all year round. See! It's a proof that this place is a travel\
  \ worthy that even animals loved to stay there. \n4. Sumilon Island Sandbar - Sumilon,\
  \ Oslob, Cebu\n It's a perfect place for getting cozy and a relaxing place to escape\
  \ the busyness of the City. They offer great food, great accommodation, infinity\
  \ pools, and a full body massage.\n5. Tumalog Waterfalls - Oslob, Cebu\n When you\
  \ speak of an ice-cold getaway, this is a place to be.\n6. Aguinid Waterfalls -\
  \ Samboan, Cebu\n Extreme water activities are offered in Aguinid waterfalls. 1-2\
  \ guides will be accompanying the Tourist to make sure the safety procedures are\
  \ observed.\n7. White Sand Beaches - Boljoon, Cebu \n White sand beaches are stretched\
  \ out all over the South, but Boljoon beaches are the best.\n\nThere are still lots\
  \ of destinations that I have not mentioned here, I promise you, it is Google worthy.\
  \ It was a spectacular experience. I always dreamt of visiting Bali, Indonesia to\
  \ explore its natural greenery without realizing I can definitely enjoy those near\
  \ me. We never had any difficulty on travelling from one destination to the other\
  \ as the locals were accommodating, they can easily recognize if you're a Tourist\
  \ and guide you to your next nearest travel worthy destination.\n\nNever a dull\
  \ moment when you travel with the local's smiling faces. It is a driving force for\
  \ Tourist's to keep on with the travel experience, to discover what makes the place\
  \ special, and it's a clear manifestation that they are blessed with the nature's\
  \ abundant bounty. \n\nWhile we are very busy researching, reading blogs, booking\
  \ tickets, reserving accommodation for our next travels, why not explore your local\
  \ tourist destinations first? Experience, explore, write travel guides, list some\
  \ travel hacks and leave reviews to help and guide the aspiring local travelers.\n\
  \nIf we can help boast the Tourism of a certain place, why not start in our own\
  \ locality and make that place known to everyone? After all, it is the locals who'll\
  \ benefit from it. More Tourists means more business to generate. \n\nIt is always\
  \ refreshing to travel to different countries once in a while for new faces, new\
  \ surroundings and new culture to explore. A year savings equals to a week travel.\
  \ We have to accept it, not everyone has the luxury and budget to travel from time\
  \ to time. And while you're very busy planning for your next escape, consider being\
  \ a Local with the Locals."
