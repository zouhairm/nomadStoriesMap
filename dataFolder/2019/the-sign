Text: "I was on my way back to the railway station of El Jadida, a Moroccan town in\
  \ almost two hours by train to the South from Casablanca where I had stayed. There\
  \ was not much to see in El Jadida, just the old Portuguese fortress built in the\
  \ beginning of the sixteenth century and nowadays playing the same part as a traditional\
  \ medina. A local store owner told me: \u201CYou have to see three places here.\
  \ The cisterns, the walls and my shop\u201D. By cisterns he meant old reservoirs\
  \ used in the Portuguese age to keep grain and, after that, water. I appreciated\
  \ his sense of humour (moreover, he knew some words in my native Russian) but didn\u2019\
  t buy anything. If I had shown my courtesy to every merchant I would have been out\
  \ of money in a moment.\nSo, one day was quite enough to explore El Jadida and I\
  \ was rushing for the train that would depart less than in an hour. If I was late\
  \ I would waste two hours more waiting for another one, without any idea what to\
  \ do all this time. I didn\u2019t know any bus routes, my legs were nagging after\
  \ a few days of nothing but walking and sightseeing and every minute was making\
  \ the chance to miss the train more real.\nI was hobbling along some deserted boulevard,\
  \ just cars were going by, when I prayed: \u201CLet somebody take me to the station,\
  \ please\u201D. Suddenly a black Land Rover stopped in ten meters ahead, I didn\u2019\
  t even raise my hand. When I reached the vehicle a young slim fellow in sunglasses\
  \ called me through an opened window:\n- Hey! Where are you going? I can give you\
  \ a lift.\n- Should I pay?\nI had already got used to the Moroccan habit to take\
  \ money for any little service but the guy answered:\n- Oh, no. I love Europeans.\n\
  Then my wild imagination shoved another insane thought to me: the boy wouldn\u2019\
  t drive me to the station, he would kidnap me and ask my parents and relatives for\
  \ a ransom. I was constantly alert visiting an arabic country but in that second\
  \ I felt myself unusually alive and decided to risk. I got into the car.\nThe guy\
  \ continued:\n- My family lives in London.\n- Don\u2019t you live with them?\n-\
  \ No, I\u2019m from Rabat, came here to see my friend.\nIt was inconvenient for\
  \ him to go right to the station so I started explaining where he would have to\
  \ drop me off. I barely managed to do it though a lot of Moroccans, including those\
  \ from small towns, speak English fluently enough. So, just in case, I was following\
  \ the map on my phone.\nThe driver didn\u2019t kidnap me. I offered some cash again\
  \ and he again refused. I said goodbye and started the rest of my way. Believing\
  \ the guy I won about ten minutes that saved me. I even had time to pop in a toilet\
  \ at the station before a long ride to Casablanca."
