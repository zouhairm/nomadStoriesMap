Text: "When you go overseas and travel solo, you learn how to be self-sufficient and\
  \ independent. As clich\xE9 as it sounds, my explorations have changed me in various\
  \ ways. I have also met several, inspirational and beautiful people.\n\nFrom a young\
  \ age, I've made it a goal to travel the world. I can proudly say that I've been\
  \ to all 3 places listed in the book Eat, Pray, Love. I've climbed the mountains\
  \ in Ubud, watched the sun rise in Kathmandu and ate the most delicious pistachio\
  \ ice cream in Florence. In every country that I've visited, I've met someone who\
  \ has changed me.  When I was in a youth hostel in Barcelona, there were two gorgeous\
  \ African girls staying in my dorm. Neither could speak English so I mustered up\
  \ the courage to ask them if they could speak French instead, \u201CParlez-vous\
  \ Fran\xE7ais?\u201D To my luck, they were from Senegal (North Africa near Morocco).\
  \ I had learnt about various French speaking countries years ago in my high school\
  \ French class, and Senegal was one of them. I was able to ask them several questions\
  \ and even give them compliments in French! \n\nFast forward onto India; a whole\
  \ six months later. I struck up a conversation with another French person who was\
  \ coincidentally a business partner with my hotel manager. The man (Fabien) and\
  \ the hotel owner (\u201CUncle\u201D) invited me for coffee and fruits in their\
  \ office. We talked about my background and my travels. In Vietnam, I met a kind\
  \ lady who took me to the markets to help me bargain down a good price for all my\
  \ clothes in Vietnamese and in Japan, I met Kevin in December of 2017.\n\nAt the\
  \ end of 2017, I had just finished university and was offered a job as an international\
  \ paralegal in Osaka, Japan. It was the very first time that I had moved out of\
  \ home, from all that was familiar and duck-dived into somewhere so foreign. I couldn't\
  \ speak a word of Japanese. I landed in Tokyo and had never felt so alone.  I came\
  \ alone to Japan 3 days before the job commenced. One week before, I had finished\
  \ my final university exam and handed in my psychology thesis. \n\nThe first night\
  \ in Tokyo, I stayed in my lonely capsule hotel and felt sorry for myself. I held\
  \ onto my pillow and felt deep sadness. In the morning, I went down to the lobby\
  \ for continental breakfast and this was when I met Kevin. He must have seen me\
  \ at my worst and felt sorry for me because he asked how my night was and where\
  \ I was from. I had panda eyes, a baggy sweater and I looked like a dork. We talked\
  \ for awhile before he asked if I wanted to explore Tokyo with him. I always have\
  \ my wits about me and I'd normally never jump at saying \"yes\" to hanging out\
  \ with a stranger, but something felt right and I knew that I needed to get out\
  \ of my misery. \n\nWe had the most amazing friend date. I'd learnt so much about\
  \ Kevin and his beautiful family. Eventually, I left for Osaka to start my career.\
  \ One month later, I received a message. It was from Kevin who told me that he had\
  \ landed a job as an English teacher in Kobe, a city 30 minutes via train from Osaka.\
  \ I met him at the airport and we instantly connected again. As the days rolled\
  \ on, we decided to make things official and we've been going strong ever since.\
  \ \n\nIn December 2018, Kevin took me to meet his family in Modesto, California.\
  \ This December 2019, Kevin will be meeting my family in Perth, Western Australia.\
  \  I count my lucky stars that I've met somebody who makes me so incredibly happy\
  \ every single day. My travels led me to meet somebody who is now my trusty travel\
  \ companion. Maybe he'll follow me to Portugal, who knows?"
