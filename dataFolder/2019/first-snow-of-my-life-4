Text: "Always dreaming of winter and snow, yes I guess it's the most common dream\
  \ you will ever hears from people who spend their lives in tropical country like\
  \ me in Indonesia. Having a trip to South Korea back in 2017 was the happiest moment\
  \ and may be the happiest trip I've done so far. \n\nFirstly, I personally didn't\
  \ expect to find or to feel snow in my hand because it was only October which is\
  \ technically should be an Autumn not a Winter yet. \n\nDay by day I spent with\
  \ windy weather, beautiful Autumn leaves blooming in every corner I passed by, it\
  \ was just a perfectly relaxing feeling. \n\nOn the fourth day, we went to visit\
  \ a castle, a king place you can say and the weather was colder than last three\
  \ days, but I love it, I enjoy it a lot. As a person coming from tropical country\
  \ with 60% Summer presentation every single year, having a cold weather is amazing,\
  \ you finally can feel something different than you always have in your life - so\
  \ I just enjoy them by wearing coat, handgloves, and boat. \nSuddenly something\
  \ touch my hair, a small hard thing, I felt cold inside my head, and I was making\
  \ sure by lifting my hand to the sky and what I got? Yes snow! Snow everybody it\
  \ was snow! The first snow in South Korea for 2017 and the very first snow for me\
  \ after living in the earth for 20 years! Can you imagine how happy I was back then?\
  \ I can't even believe myself that time, as I remember I was gratefully crying and\
  \ happy and fantastic. \n\nI never expected to have snow on October, like who will?\
  \ But then miss fortune is with me, she gives it to make one of my dream come true.\
  \ I wish I could have more snow in continuing years later."
