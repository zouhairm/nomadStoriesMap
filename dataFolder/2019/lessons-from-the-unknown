Text: "I\u2019m an island girl that always dreamed of traveling, I never traveled\
  \ much as a child but I enjoyed seeing persons take on adventures and always wondered\
  \ how I could do that with my life. Being a traveler learning never ceases which\
  \ I discovered when I explored my island, later on I then became curious to see\
  \ what lessons I would gain from exploring other countries. The day finally came\
  \ for me to leave the place I called home for all my life, the island known for\
  \ its coffee, blue waters, soft sands, free spirited people, the third largest Caribbean\
  \ island with population being 2.89 million; Jamaica. I was excited yet anxious\
  \ to migrate to the second largest country in the world, Canada, here I would continue\
  \ my life's journey, meet new people and attain new goals for the betterment of\
  \ myself. I am taking a bold and courageous leap, I thought. A leap into the unknown,\
  \ to a country I never visited, what I knew about Canada was what I acquired from\
  \ the internet or from what people had to say. Nevertheless being anxious, this\
  \ was what I wanted, I envisioned myself there and now I\u2019m receiving an opportunity\
  \ to travel to an unknown place, this made my heart & soul jump for joy. I boarded\
  \ the plane, as I settled in different  thoughts swarmed my mind, I told myself\
  \ that I am ready to explore, readjust and to be the best version of myself.  The\
  \ plane started to move down the runway, this is it, no turning back I told myself\
  \ with eyes closed. The plane sped up in preparation to take off, I clutched unto\
  \ my chair and as I opened my eyes the plane was among the clouds overlooking blue\
  \ waters and lush green land, my view was impeccable. Jamaica you are breathtaking,\
  \ I will surely miss you, goodbye for now. \n\n\n\nMy leap into the unknown will\
  \ soon give me the answers to all my questions and dreams,unknowingly it just won\u2019\
  t be at the same time. The pilot announced that landing would be in a few minutes,\
  \ I gazed out my window and saw a sea of lights, I was no longer anxious, just excited\
  \ for that moment, I could tell that the plane was getting closer to landing, until\
  \ it finally did. I welcomed myself to the city of Toronto, I arrived into the unknown\
  \ with a low phone battery and no service, how exciting I thought in sarcasm. First\
  \ lesson  the unknown taught me was bravery and confidence, I ended up missing my\
  \ connecting flight to the city of Calgary, with no phone to call family I thought\
  \ maybe I should ask someone for a call, never in my life have I done that before,\
  \ nonetheless, I did it. Everyone that I asked never denied me a phone call nor\
  \ did they give me the impression that they were only giving me a call out of pity,\
  \ all were  genuine and I felt that in my heart, I was thankful for everything.\
  \ Second lesson the unknown taught me was, be kind and help others when I am able\
  \ to.\n\n As I waited outside Toronto Pearson International airport I observed my\
  \ surroundings, I awed in gratitude and appreciation.  The high rise buildings wowed\
  \ me, everywhere was lit with lights of different colours, I was amazed at the fast\
  \ pace of everyone and everything... the island was nothing like this. The next\
  \ morning I arrived in the city of Calgary, which was a smaller Toronto, here, I\
  \ saw my first sun rise and my heart was illuminated with happiness. Third lesson\
  \ was, travel for views, experiences and happiness. I was then driven for three\
  \ hours to British Columbia, the entire drive I saw nothing but acres of land, deer,\
  \ elks and monstrous mountains which were gorgeous, I now understood the name beautiful\
  \ British Columbia. We arrived to a small town called Sparwood, with population\
  \ being 3,784 with little diversity. At this moment I became anxious with not an\
  \ ounce of excitement, will this leap be worth it? Fourth lesson was never expect\
  \ and be open to anything, which lead be to wonder, was the unknown now home?"
