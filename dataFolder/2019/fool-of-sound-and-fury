Text: "She just jumped into that hazel eyes where she saw herself reflected into it:\
  \ soulmate. Was a new music pulsating in her heart, skin, brain, everything: she\
  \ felt in love. Burn her ships, relationships, meaning, focus... nothing more matter\
  \ but it. This could be just another nuts history about being passionate, and was,\
  \ completely, famous Saturn's return: what could be done? Free pass for the body,\
  \ brain was out. For the very first time that powerful energy, a beam of inner fire\
  \ opened its eyes; how could she ignore it?\nThe travel for this living feeling,\
  \ where all the possibilities could be reached and she felt so strong, so deeply\
  \ existing, truly being woke up, was the path to meet after all, herself, not him.\
  \ But there is no path, the trail is made of walking into it, and this new place\
  \ full of flowers and kisses was just the border of a maze full of falls, dark pupils\
  \ and a desert of faith. But let's enter along this journey, about respect, values,\
  \ beautiful and darkness. \nWas after his return of some dive into pre Colombian\
  \ places and culture they got the first beach, their first island of paradise. Using\
  \ a coin they had all the hapiness to decide where to be Adan and Eva in their bouble\
  \ of love - and as a good bouble, use to explode anytime... with a help from another\
  \ lover, they divide a little boat and got to the beach before the place they was\
  \ looking for. Even a bit sick she was the one of that tripod who more resist the\
  \ climbing way with all that bagage for the camping thing - she felt as godess in\
  \ her truly will of living that moment plenity. What could stop our hearts of being\
  \ so happy?\nOnce there, counting stars, touching the purple velvet's leaves, making\
  \ underwater signals, making love everywhere, just like two apes, so pure, nothing\
  \ nor anybody more matters: that could be eternity - with children maybe. But, they\
  \ were not alone. Not with anybody else, but with other ghosts around them, inside\
  \ them, memories of what they left, what people in the work and social \"normal\
  \ life\" would ask - moments of bad trip, boom, bouble pop up. But her honey of\
  \ soup was always making another, colorful, giant boubles, all the sky filled of\
  \ that, a bridge of ilusion for still navigating above the complicate maze they\
  \ entered - so much tears in the future washed them all; but in the future, in that\
  \ time, the psychedelic experience of love painted all her sense. \nThey returned\
  \ in a ironic boat named \"No Regrets\", and somehow life start showing signs of\
  \ that jump in dark, like a circus pool, an ilusion between nothing and everything.\
  \ Then became the second trip: linn reveillon. Three days of music, sinstesy, camping,\
  \ colors, butterflies, cheeses, sweat, and all they was certain about being happy\
  \ and full. But still growing a feeling inside her heart about not knowing him anymore:\
  \ he started lying for her. After her divorce, and a new house to show him how into\
  \ it she was, he became guileful - or just brought what he had inside to out. Eyes\
  \ to eyes, that honey ring, so hipnotic start envoling her in a web of madness.\n\
  This false paradise she was addicted, like a blinded taurus, started making her\
  \ ill, inside her heart and losing weight as weel - friends of her asked why so\
  \ skinny? He use to say for her: they are heartburning you. This trip turn into\
  \ seeking herself again, lost in the maze of her own brain, veins, mess of not knowing\
  \ anymore the godess she once saw. \nThen the mask felt. All the time he made her\
  \ look in one direction, like a magician, doing other thing so near to her nose\
  \ she could just not see! The difference was that was no funny joke: he was picking\
  \ poket her dignity, her honor, glory, dreams, life, love. They broke, then tried\
  \ to fix, with all the golden clue she could... there was no way of being truly\
  \ happy withherself, as feminist, with her heart so agressive stucked. Walked home\
  \ to her onw soul after all."
