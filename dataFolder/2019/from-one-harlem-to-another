Text: "I arrived in New York on a cold January morning. Up to that point America had\
  \ just been a figment of my imagination populated with characters from Hollywood\
  \ and books. My welcome to America experience was a Nigerian cab driver conning\
  \ me $25 after driving me around near JFK Airport and dumping me in the middle of\
  \ nowhere. Two guys who were standing outside in the cold smoking helped me to figure\
  \ out where I was and where I needed to go. Welcome to America.\n\nHarlem is where\
  \ I wanted to be but it would not be for another few months.\n\nI had a sense of\
  \ de javu coming out of the subway in Harlem at 125th Street. The energy and dynamism\
  \ in this part of New York city is different from the rest. And it is the one place\
  \ I have seen the most black people all round at once.  The bustling streets of\
  \ Harlem reminded me of Harare streets \u2013you can get anything you want on the\
  \ streets \u2013 cheap t/shirts, burned cds, love portions, sidewalk booksellers.\
  \ Everything is familiar, it is so much like home but not.\n\nTwo of the main streets\
  \ in Harlem are named after iconic figures \u2013 Martin Luther King Jnr and Malcom\
  \ X. Here is what struck me. With all that I know of the two characters from their\
  \ historiography the streets felt mismatched. Martin Luther King Boulevard is the\
  \ busier artery that cuts Harlem in the middle, while the two-way street named after\
  \ the radical militant Malcom X Boulevard also known, as Lennox Avenue is strangely\
  \ serene and quiet. The poetic contradictions of Harlem.\n\nMy time in America has\
  \ also greatly coincided with the unnecessary killing of blackmen by the people\
  \ expected to protect them. You would think the world has grown past the black-white\
  \ racism, but clearly not. The only time I have been self-conscious and afraid to\
  \ be black is now, and living in America as a thirty-something blackman means that\
  \ I am a suspect of a crime that I am not even planning to commit. \n\nI had become\
  \ a part of the Harlem landscape, a place I have always associated with blackness\
  \ and black history and black space. The vibrancy, the colour, the energy that\u2019\
  s all here because of those things. This is what fascinated me, the characters that\
  \ populate Harlem. Like in my beloved Harare, people respond to the street as a\
  \ community in and of itself. While in my imagination I had not so much imagined\
  \ or anticipated parasitic corporates such as Starbucks in my cultural and historicalHarlem\
  \ but I think that tension is really interesting to visualise.\n\nI told a friend\
  \ from Brazil how Harare is also nicknamed as \u2018Harlem\u2019 and how this visit\
  \ had an important soul effect on me. He told me a brief history of Harlem, especially\
  \ how change has always been Harlem's watchword, from its start as a Dutch village\
  \ to the time, at the beginning of the 20th century, when it was the mecca of the\
  \ new generation of black artists and politicians who came here in the years before\
  \ the first world war and called themselves the New Negroes, to the dark days of\
  \ the 70s and 80s, when taxis refused to take passengers uptown and today its becoming\
  \ more gentrified.\n \nIt was worth it. Even though I miss the \u2018Harlem\u2019\
  \ where I was born and grew up, I also felt at home in the other Harlem."
