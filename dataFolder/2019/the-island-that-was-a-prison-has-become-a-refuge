Text: "There is a war raging as I run towards the edge of the old wooden jetty and\
  \ leap. The sun glares off my pale skin as my body plunges into the chill of the\
  \ Tasman Sea. I feel alive. \n\nI said good-bye to my husband and two daughters\
  \ to take this pilgrimage. We had moved to Tasmania years before and I had given\
  \ birth to my daughter here. That was when the war began. I was at war with myself.\
  \ It was a desolate war and a result of my post-natal depression. We had returned\
  \ to my hometown in Queensland, after three years to the support and open arms of\
  \ our family and friends. This trip was a journey to heal old battle scars and to\
  \ see Tasmania in her glory. \n\nWe land on the shore of Maria Island, located off\
  \ Tasmania's east coast. I am joined on my four-day hike by a group of strangers.\
  \ They are strangers who compete in the New York Marathon for a good time, volunteer\
  \ to collect seeds of rare rainforest trees and are survivors of harrowing life\
  \ tragedies and continue to smile and find joy. I tell them my story and they cloak\
  \ me with their protection, friendship and support like a warm blanket. \nWe hike\
  \ through old growth, open forest of Brown-top Stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua),\
  \ Tasmanian Blue-gum (Eucalyptus globulus) and Manna Gum (Eucalyptus viminalis).\
  \ We are dwarfed by the tall woodland of the plateaus and we climb through the scree\
  \ slope mosaic and up to the mountain top heath. \n\nDescribed as \"Noah's Ark\"\
  , Maria Island is a haven for threatened species which have been introduced in an\
  \ effort to conserve and protect them. What was once an isolated and foreboding\
  \ convict probation station is now a refuge for species including Cape Barren Geese\
  \ (Cereopsis novaehollandiae), Forester Kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), Bennetts\
  \ Wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) and Tasmanian Native Hen (Tribonyx mortierii).\
  \ Due to their population decline as a result of the facial-tumour disease, Tasmanian\
  \ Devils (Sarcophilus harrisii) were also released onto the island as part of a\
  \ captive breeding program. I see their footprints in the sand as a testament to\
  \ their thriving population and I am grateful to have not heard their screams at\
  \ night which I am told sound like the devil himself.\n\nA pair of Swift Parrot\
  \ (Lathmous discolor) fly in front of me and perch before feeding on the nectar\
  \ of a Brown-top Stringybark. Wombats (Vombatus ursinus) lollop about leaving their\
  \ square poo to mark their territory. \n\nThe day of hiking has resulted in sizeable\
  \ blisters on both of my heels. Our walking guide reassures me by explaining that\
  \ he was once an ambulance officer and is experienced in blister lancing. My shame\
  \ is held at bay only by my eagerness to relieve the pain when walking. The razor\
  \ blade slices through the skin of my heel, as clear liquid oozes out like lava.\
  \ I sense a familiar lack of dignity, similar to that which I felt post childbirth.\
  \ \n\nWith freshly lanced heels we hike to our final destination, the World Heritage\
  \ Listed settlement of Darlington. A delightful name for what was once a convict\
  \ probation station. We arrive through an avenue of Monterey Cypress (Cupressus\
  \ macrocarpa). Darlington is a combination of English cottage charm with a good\
  \ dash of prison hellhole. The clouds have settled in and the north-easterly winds\
  \ have whipped up. I walk alone through the relics of convict history. The grey\
  \ sky match the dull colour of the concrete historic silos which sit atop a field\
  \ of grass where Cape Barron Geese forage. \n\nThis island is an ark of hope for\
  \ threatened species and a bleak reminder of Tasmania's convict past. This island\
  \ and the folk I journeyed with were my Noah's Ark of hope, friendship and healing\
  \ of war wounds. I experienced Tasmania in all her glory, isolation and magnificence.\
  \ Tasmania, the place that was once my isolated prison, had become my refuge."
