Text: "It started in a reservoir, in the middle of North America on a 420 dinghy sailboat.\
  \ We spent the summer learning how to sail, we talked about sailing around the world,\
  \ buying a boat on the coast, but where to start? It seemed like such a far off\
  \ dream being land locked, living on the edge of the Canadian Rockies. \n\nAnd then,\
  \ just as if we were asking for a sign, we made a new friend down the street,  he\
  \ had just bought the Blue Jay, a 45ft racing/cruising sailboat in Malta. It was\
  \ July and he was spending the month of August on the boat sailing the Greek islands.\
  \ Would we like to go? Yes! Obviously! How could we say no? So I took the rest of\
  \ vacation time for the year and within a month we were on a bus travelling from\
  \ Athens to Patras, where we would pick up the boat and start out the journey. Although\
  \ I had never actually lived abroad a sailboat, the moment I stepped o board it\
  \ felt like home. \n\nThe Greek islands are where all the Europeans go to vacation\
  \ for the month of August. There are European tourists everywhere and this makes\
  \ the lesser known greek islands come alive! \nOur first stop was Galaxidi, a cool\
  \ town in the Gulf of Corinth, we walked up hill through cobblestone white washed\
  \ streets, away from the tourist areas to find the most amazing dolmades and Ouzo\
  \ I'd ever tasted. We sailed through the Gulf of Corinth, through the magnificent\
  \ Corinth Canal, sailed with dolphins along the way and cruised into Poros for famous\
  \ mega yacht watching and a nice night on the town along the harbour front. \nMy\
  \ first day on the helm, I sailed from Poros to Hydra. There are no cars on the\
  \ island, only donkeys, lots of great restaurants and amazing nightlife surrounding\
  \ the harbour. The next day we spent 10 hours heeled over sideways, sailing 87 nautical\
  \ miles from Hydra to Antiparos, averaging 8 to 9 knots with the windspeed around\
  \ 25 to 30 knots. The meltemi was on that day! Antiparos is a kiteboarding mecca,\
  \ the water is shallow and crystal clear and there were kites in the air as far\
  \ as the eye could see. We spent three days here, walking the cool maze like streets\
  \ at night. We drank in the town square, packed with beautiful stylish people with\
  \ sun kissed tans and kids on scooters pushing through the crowds from down below.\
  \ We didn't want to leave, but we knew the weather was telling us to take this window.\
  \ We were already turning around, we needed to head back up toward Athens. We motored\
  \ up to Kythnos, with unusually calm mediterranean blue waters, anchored the boat\
  \ and dined under the stars at the famous sandbar anchorage. We finished off with\
  \ a perfect sail up to Lavrion where we would say goodbye to the Blue Jay and head\
  \ back to Canada. \n\nTravelling on a sailboat is freedom on the water. It feels\
  \ like you are a part of an exclusive club, you go places that most people can't\
  \ and you experience a place like no one else gets to.  Your destination and mood\
  \ is always dictated by the weather. Provisioning for food is always an adventure\
  \ and there are an endless amount of things to fix. It is an incredible way to connect\
  \ with new people, explore the unknown and feel one with the sea! The only thing\
  \ I can hope for now is more time on the water!"
