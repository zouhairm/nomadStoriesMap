Text: "My first day of teaching English began in the bathroom of the teacher\u2019\
  s lounge, bent over a seatless toilet. Outside of the bathroom the teachers were\
  \ huddled together for the brief fifteen minute break between their 9:30 and 10:30\
  \ lessons. I could hear their loud bursts of French. Right now it was nothing more\
  \ than an unintelligible buzz in my ear. What was the French government thinking\
  \ giving me this job? I had never felt comfortable around middle schoolers (even\
  \ when I was one), and despite the few days of \u201Ctraining\u201D they\u2019d\
  \ given us when all of the new language assistants arrived at the beginning of October,\
  \ I knew nothing about teaching. \n \nThe 10:30 bell did not wait for my breathing\
  \ to even out or for my hands to stop shaking. I wiped my mouth on the back of a\
  \ paper towel and made my way to class. \n\nOnce inside the bright and empty classroom\
  \ I wasted a few minutes turning the computer on, fighting with the projector, and\
  \ arranging my whiteboard markers in a line on the desk. Eventually I peeked my\
  \ head out of my room to find eight sixth graders, sixi\xE8mes, stood in a straight\
  \ line outside my door. The second they saw me their hushed whispers turned to silence.\
  \ I ushered them into the room with the most genuine smile I could muster, and in\
  \ return they offered me quiet hellos. I made my way back to the computer, pulling\
  \ up my \u201Cabout me\u201D presentation. When I looked over my shoulder they were\
  \ still standing behind their seats, looking at me. \n\n\u201COh, sorry! Please\
  \ go ahead and sit down!\u201D Once the sound of scraping chairs had quieted down,\
  \ I continued. \u201CGood morning!\u201D \n\n\u201CGood morning,\u201D they parrotted\
  \ in an accent that was both cute and my job to correct. \n\nThen with a deep breath\
  \ it was on with the presentation. I felt incredibly uninteresting standing there\
  \ at the front of the room. I did my best not to look too closely at them. \n\n\u201C\
  Any questions?\u201D I asked once I had finished. \n\nThe sixi\xE8mes just looked\
  \ at me. Their faces were blank and their eyes were wide. I looked back at them.\
  \ For a moment we all shared a collective sense of panic.\n\n\u201CWhat did you\
  \ understand?\u201D\n\nSilence accompanied by a few pointed blinks. I repeated the\
  \ question again, this time much slower. The result was the same.\n\nNine years\
  \ of French and one month of life in Normandy had not made speaking French to actual\
  \ French people any easier. I still spent too much time in line at the grocery store\
  \ constructing potential answers to potential questions. I still did my best to\
  \ avoid small talk at the bus stop. It looked like French was my only hope right\
  \ now. \u201CQu\u2019est-ce que vous avez compris?\u201D\n\n\u201CAhhhhh\u201D several\
  \ of them said as comprehension spread across their faces. Relief spread through\
  \ me simultaneously. \n\n\u201CRien.\u201D \n\n\u201CNothing?\u201D I echoed in\
  \ English. \u201COkay. Let\u2019s do this again.\u201D \n\nAs I went through the\
  \ presentation again, translating and gesticulating as necessary, it felt like the\
  \ students and I had reached a compromise of sorts. Both speaking and thinking outside\
  \ our mother tongue, meeting each other halfway.\n\n When I asked for questions\
  \ again, their hands shot up. Mercifully their questions filled the rest of the\
  \ hour. The questions ranged from \u201C\u201Care all Americans cowboys?\u201D to\
  \ \u201Cdo you eat hamburgers every day?\u201D to eventually  \u201Chow do you feel\
  \ about Donald Trump?\u201D \n\nWhen the bell rang they gathered their notebooks\
  \ in their hands and called out \u201Cgoodbye, miss!\u201D \n\nAlthough my face\
  \ was still red, my forehead sticky with sweat, the relief stayed with me."
