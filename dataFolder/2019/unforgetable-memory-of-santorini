Text: "Santorini is a place that I have always wanted to visit. With its historical\
  \ story \"God and Goddess of Greece\" made me fell in love with it.\n\nSantorini\
  \ is an island in the southern Aegean Sea. When I travelled to Santorini last year\
  \ on April, I joined the Catamaran Cruise. Though it was a short trip, around 1.5\
  \ hours sailing through the Aegean Sea, I was still happy. My dreams come true,\
  \ I could see upclose of the Aegean Sea which is very beautiful and nice. \n\nOne\
  \ of the best place to visit is  a village named \"Oia\" , The architecture there\
  \ were truly awesome. Many white and blue painted houses at Oia, which is called\
  \ cliff houses. People can stroll around the village by walking, because Oia is\
  \ located on top of the hill, which is also surrended by the sea. Many souvenirs\
  \ and cafe there. It is the best place to see sunset too. There were many nice spots\
  \ to take photos . So instragammable!\n\nSantorini is considered to be the most\
  \ sought place for romantic getaway.  And I agree for it!  The Greek people are\
  \ so pretty and handsome too. \n\nOne time, when I was having dinner as I waited\
  \ for the sunset at one of the Oia's restaurant, the waiter who served me was Greek\
  \ Guy. As he talked to me, I was like hypnotized into his blue ocean eyes. \n\n\
  As I love eating, the food in Santorini were impressive too. Fresh seafood..fresh\
  \ vegetables and fresh fruits made me really spoiled and happy.\n\nSure, must visit\
  \ Santorini again!"
