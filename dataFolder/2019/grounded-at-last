Text: "\u201CThis is where they lived?\u201D I asked as I stepped gingerly into a\
  \ mostly abandoned house, the roof and walls caving in exposing much of the interior\
  \ to the elements. I was nervous. Anticipation was meeting reality and I had no\
  \ idea what this was that I was overcome with, except that it was unlike anything\
  \ I had felt before.\nI never had a connection to my ancestors in India and don\u2019\
  t even have a memory of meeting any of my grandparents. \nIt was one of many moments\
  \ during my six week sojourn in India when I felt this emotion; unfamiliar, raw\
  \ and yet  important and essential in some inexplicable way. \nI was born in Pakistan,\
  \ and lived there for a month before going to our home in Indonesia as a newborn,\
  \  with my mother and two brothers. My father travelled a lot for work and my mom\
  \ needed my grandmother\u2019s help during the last stage of her pregnancy. At four\
  \ years old, we moved to Singapore until my family immigrated to Canada when I was\
  \ twelve and a half. \nIn the Toronto area, a high percentage of residents were\
  \ born outside of Canada so it was not at all uncommon for people to ask where I\
  \ was from. I always hesitated. I would tell them my parents were from India. I\
  \ didn\u2019t feel tied to any one place, and I was eager to adapt to my new Canadian\
  \ home. I was enraptured by ice hockey and the sound of leaves crunching beneath\
  \ me as summer turned to fall. \nI was focused on the present and the future. My\
  \ culture was a part of me but more in the rear view mirror.  I felt a deep divide\
  \ within my understanding of it and its impact on my life. I ate home-cooked Indian\
  \ food, at times watched over-the-top Bollywood films, read fascinating novels by\
  \ Rohinton Mistry and even took an Ancient and Modern Indian history course. I kept\
  \ hoping these activities would ignite something within me and I\u2019d finally\
  \ feel this connection I longed for. But it evaded me. \nUntil now. I was twenty-five\
  \ years old, and it was the first time I could answer the question of where I was\
  \ from. Here I was in a verdant field in the middle of rural Pirna, Goa with cashew\
  \ trees swaying sleepily and the winter sun beating down on us. \nThis is where\
  \ I\u2019m from. \nMy great-grandparents had settled in this land and lived here,\
  \ but it has since fallen into ruin. Most of the family save my great-aunt Romaldina\
  \ had left Goa for better opportunities in big cities. My grandmother had gone to\
  \ Karachi before partition and it became part of Pakistan in 1947. My father and\
  \ mother had moved halfway across the world several times creating new homes, and\
  \ building a better life for our family. My father\u2019s employer paid for the\
  \ family to go \u201Chome\u201D every year but we never went to India; he had left\
  \ home at sixteen and not looked back too often. Instead we would travel to different\
  \ countries every year. \n\u201CWhere should we go this year?\u201D he\u2019d ask.\
  \ \nAustralia. France. Canada. Thailand. Italy. America. I began to think that maybe\
  \ it didn\u2019t matter that we never went to India. But this was never true. \n\
  Reading about the history of a place, watching movies set there and hearing stories\
  \ about my family were one thing. Sipping coconut water with my aunt and cousins\
  \ after a day exploring my father\u2019s hometown in Mangalore and visiting the\
  \ school where he studied and made plans for his future was another beast altogether.\
  \ \nI asked my aunt recently if any of our family has any claim to the land in Goa.\
  \ She had looked into it a few years ago with hopes that someone might build a holiday\
  \ home there one day. It was a bureaucratic and logistical nightmare just to figure\
  \ out who to talk to about it. \nI think about that house in even further ruin,\
  \ with the cashew trees likely overgrown; my great-aunt is no longer alive. But\
  \ it\u2019s enough for me to know that it might still be there."
