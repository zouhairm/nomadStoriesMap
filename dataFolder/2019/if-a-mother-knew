Text: "When acting irresponsible, they always say, \u201Cact your age\u201D. At what\
  \ age, I wondered, is it responsible to do what I am doing. What would they say\
  \ to me instead? \n\nAre you lost? \nLike in life? Or why am I here? Yes, and I\
  \ don\u2019t know.\nI had been holding my credit card before dawn and had a month\
  \ to kill before I started a new job. And now here I am. Oh fuck.\n\n\u201CWhich\
  \ organization are you with?\u201D\n I was asked for the second time in a week.\
  \ Except it sounded different this time (or I received it differently).\nI wanted\
  \ to say that I was with the Red Cross and was meeting my colleagues. But I was\
  \ not, so I could not.\n\u201CI'm not with an organization.\u201D\n\u201COk, so\
  \ you're a journalist.\u201D\nA question, a statement, it didn\u2019t matter.\n\u201C\
  No.\u201D\n\u201CWhy are you here?\u201D\nI am an idiot.\n\u201CI want to see Mogadishu\u201D\
  .\n\nA couple of weeks earlier I was sitting in an airy office with a pleasant,\
  \ but dumbfounded or bored - I wasn\u2019t sure - immigration officer for Somalia.\
  \ I was asked the same questions. And I proudly announced that I was a tourist.\
  \ They have few tourists, she explained but would give me a visa. Winning.\n\nThe\
  \ official in Aden Adde International Airport was neither dumbfounded or bored.\
  \ He was concerned.\n\n\u201CI can\u2019t let you leave the airport...\u201D\nGood,\
  \ put me on the next flight out.\n\u201C...without armed security.\u201D\nTo protect\
  \ me from myself? Please.\n\u201COk\u201D, I said. Not really knowing what armed\
  \ security meant. We had sandflies where I came from. And a hole in the ozone layer.\n\
  \nI found a seat. Thought about nothing. I was reluctant to let my brain stumble\
  \ back into reality.  They say you can\u2019t ignore your problems, so that\u2019\
  s what I did. A man appeared. Bashiir. He brought me back to reality. I liked him\
  \ instantly. He was either going to help or politely end it for me. He offered his\
  \ full service. Himself as a guide, hotel, vehicles and some armed men.\n\n\u201C\
  How much?\u201D\n\u201CWe\u2019ll talk about that later.\u201D\nWe shook hands.\n\
  \nWe left the terminal and met with my escort. Nine armed men. I hoped I was being\
  \ scammed and didn\u2019t need protection.\n\nI am going to Somalia; I had said\
  \ to my Father\n.\n\u201COh. Don\u2019t tell your Mother.\u201D\n\nI knew nothing\
  \ about Bashiir. No one outside of Somalia knew where I was going. I forgot why\
  \ I was here.\n\nI wish I had told my Mother.\n\nOur two cars left in convoy. The\
  \ airport seemed more like a military compound than a civilian airport. What did\
  \ I know?  \n\nThe streets we drove through were just like home in New Zealand.\
  \ Cars. People. Shops.\nBut nothing like home. Armoured cars. Armed people. Pockmarked\
  \ shops.\n\nWe pulled up to a security gate with high walls. We drove into the square\
  \ courtyard watched over by a sign which read, Peace Hotel.\n\nI knew Peace Hotel.\
  \ Popular with journalists and NGO expat staff. I hadn\u2019t been in touch with\
  \ them because I couldn\u2019t afford them. And here I was.\n\nI only had a few\
  \ days in Mogadishu before I caught a flight to Nairobi. \nAfter exploring the city\
  \ I was sitting with Bashiir eating fresh mangoes while watching television.\n\n\
  When hearing about a horrific event, we often remark that it never happens here.\
  \ Except I wasn\u2019t here. I was there. 71 dead and approximately 200 wounded.\
  \ Al Qaeda linked terror group from Somalia, Al Shabab, had attacked a mall in Nairobi.\
  \ Front lines between African Union forces and Al Shabab was in Mogadishu two years\
  \ ago. I arrived after the attack and was now heading to Nairobi. Bashiir told me\
  \ that he has been an Al Shabab target ever since starting to help foreigners.\n\
  \nThis was my flub.\n\nExcept it didn\u2019t matter. In a few weeks, I was set to\
  \ begin a job as a glacier guide where not even the sandflies could touch me. Bashiir\
  \ would carry on with his life here.\n\nI didn\u2019t need a Mother to protect me.\
  \ I needed a Mother to teach me about my privilege."
