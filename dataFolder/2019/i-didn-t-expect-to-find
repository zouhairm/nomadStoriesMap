Text: "I didn't expect to find, IGUASU FALLS! Not until I was there, in Argentina,\
  \ was I told about this \"magical place\" on the border with Brasil.  If/When the\
  \ moment comes and my life \"flashes before my eyes\", these waterfalls may very\
  \ well be the last image I see.\n\tI didn't expect to find, MY PADI/SCUBA CERTIFICATE\
  \ IN EGYPT! Not until I was there, in Egypt, was I told \"you should go scuba diving\
  \ in the Dahab.\"  I had no idea that the Red Sea was one of the premeire places\
  \ in the World for scuba diving.  When one hears of Egypt you think of pyramids\
  \ not coral reefs, desert sands not sandy beaches, asps not eels.  \n\tI didn't\
  \ expect to find, PETRA!  Not until I was there, in Egypt, was I told, \"you should\
  \ go to Jordan and visit Petra.\"  And there it was, buried in the rocks, an entire\
  \ city.  I recognized it immediately, oh yes, there is where Indiana Jones found\
  \ the Holy Grail! And I too, drank from this cup of eternal life, for this city\
  \ was magical and mysterious, mystical and mountainous, forgotten and crowded with\
  \ tourists, buried and alive.  \n\tI didn't expect to find ANGKOR WAT!  Not until\
  \ I was there, in Thailand, was I told \"you should go to Cambodia and see Angkor\
  \ Wat.\"  What? No, Wat.  What Wat?  Angkor.  Encore? No, Angkor.  NO, ENCORE!!!\
  \ More, MORE, MORE...Interesting how vividly I can recall never being taught about\
  \ this place in my World History classes.  \n\tI didn't expect to find, ISLA MAGDALENA!\
  \  Not until I was there, in Chile, was I told, \"you should join us tomorrow to\
  \ visit the penguins.\"  Punta Arenas, Patagonia, me, Alvaro the Spainard, Benny\
  \ the Israeli, 30 something other tourists, and 120,000 penguins! A marvelous sight\
  \ to see them nesting, walking, swimming, sleeping, living.\n\tI didn't expect to\
  \ find, DEATH ROAD! Not until I was there, in Bolivia, was I told, \"here in La\
  \ Paz we have the world's most deadliest road.\"  Mountain bikes, a cold morning\
  \ mountain start point...ending in a lush, steamy tropical jungle, pool side buffet\
  \ and a long refreshing swim.  Not to mention, a t-shirt proclaiming \"I SURVIVED\
  \ THE WORLD'S DEADLIEST ROAD!\"  It's not official unless you have the shirt.\n\t\
  I didn't expect to find ROUTE 36!  Also in Bolivia, also a deadly mountain, no shirt\
  \ but I survived...barely.\n\tI didn't expect to find TRUE LOVE! In Brasil, 17 different\
  \ times during Carnival.  Not until I was there did I...\n\tI didn't expect to find\
  \ myself  ALL ALONE IN THE GREAT PYRAMID OF CHEOPS!  Not until I was there, in Egypt,\
  \ during the Arab Spring Revolution in 2013, when everyone and my mother, told me\
  \ not to go, did I enjoy the Pyramid all to myself.\n\tI didn't expect to find a\
  \ plane ticket waiting for me in my Inbox, so I worked my ass off to save and not\
  \ live in debt and put all my eggs in one travel basket and off I went, again and\
  \ again and again and again...\n\tI didn't expect to find a brain tumor on my father's\
  \ MRI results! Not until we were there, in the hospital, did we realize the magnitude\
  \ of his condition.  14 months as his caretaker, countless tears, a long-quick goodbye,\
  \ and he off he went...then off I went on a 4-month round-the-world trip...BATTERY\
  \ RECHARGING.\n\tI didn't expect to find a lifelong travel partner, but a mutual\
  \ friend arranged a blind date and I would later ask her to marry me and WE didn't\
  \ expect to find ourselves on our honeymoon in DUSSELDORF, GERMANY, on the night\
  \ of the World Cup Final 2014!  Not until I was there did I understand the true\
  \ definition of a Victory Celebration.\n\tI didn't expect to find this TWO YEAR\
  \ OLD BABY BOY IN MY LAP!  Not until I was there, Row 36, Seat B, on a 21 hour flight\
  \ to India to see my wife's family, did I truly understand the definition of Torture!\
  \  \n        I DO expect to find IGUASU FALLS, waiting to grace me with her beauty\
  \ once again, in this life or the next..."
