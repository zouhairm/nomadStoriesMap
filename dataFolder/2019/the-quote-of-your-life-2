Text: "I believe that all people in this great world have a phrase that frame us either\
  \ because we found it read, or to listen to in one of those typical films of personal\
  \ motivation, or either because we read it in a book or that a person told us in\
  \ a difficult or beautiful moment of our life, and that phrase we want or not we\
  \ are constantly remembering. \n\nIn this life we all have ups and downs, and many\
  \ times to be remembering the past we can not see the opportunities that life gives\
  \ us, and to be focusing all our energy in that situation \"bad\" that seems to\
  \ me no situation is bad, because we can all get  something positive is either so\
  \ that in the future does not happen to us or simply is a lesson that wants to give\
  \ our lives, to remind us that we are human and feel pain, and we must also give\
  \ thanks for that kind of situations that make us grow as a person and thus values\
  \ what we have. \n\nAnd that is the journey of life, our ups and downs, and it is\
  \ in us to know how to get the good out of every situation. \nMy phrase of life\
  \ is \"many times to be lost in our pain and sadness, we sat watching a door that\
  \ is already hill, when the one side is open waiting for us with new opportunities\
  \ and adventures.\" \n\nIt is a trip that we do not know when it will end or where,\
  \ so we must create memories day by day, no matter where we are, whether we travel\
  \ to the village that is 15 minutes from the city or another continent."
