Text: "Sharing three years of your life with a Francophile best friend could be tough.\
  \ But what is even harder is travelling through Paris with them and watching them\
  \ fawn over every signpost written (quite obviously) in French. However, what no\
  \ one ever tells you about travelling with your *insert country name here+phile*\
  \ friend is that it would be extremely fun, especially if you love the onslaught\
  \ of random bits of information at the most unexpected times (I was made aware of\
  \ the fact that one of the french slangs for the police was 'poulet' (chicken) while\
  \ we were getting our passports checked. Fun.) \nHowever, this is not that story.\
  \ This is also not a cautionary tale of travelling with *insert country name here+phile*\
  \ friends. Although caution is advised, one can never resist the urge, nay, one\
  \ can never get rid of such friends. Unless you're willing to commit a crime most\
  \ brutal, which is not travelling at all. However, I digress. This is the tale of\
  \ the treason most high, how I was lured into the Palace of Versailles with just\
  \ hours to spare to go back, collect my bags, figure a way to the airport, reach\
  \ the airport, check my bags, get my ticket, and wile away my time like every normal,\
  \ well functioning, well-to-do, with a well full of well-wishers, human being has\
  \ a right to. But. \"Lets just have a glance at the museum wing as well\" she said.\
  \ And while I have been going on this tirade, spewing a word of caution against\
  \ the *insert country name here+phile\" friends, Francophiles among the worst, closely\
  \ followed by Anglophiles, I myself have a bit of an obsession, to my great regret.\
  \ I have, what I like to call the \"geeking-out-at-a-museum\" a self-explanatory\
  \ term, albeit a long one. However, as someone who has a favorite word (crazy, right?)\
  \ which happens to be supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, even though the sound\
  \ of it something quite atrocious (thanks, Ms. Poppins), this is hardly unusual\
  \ for me. Going back to our tale most foul, no sooner had the words museum escaped\
  \ her mouth, all the Self-restraint, I as a recovering \"Geek of the Museum\" possessed,\
  \ evaporated suddenly, until there was nothing left, like the little water droplets\
  \ on the bottom of a pan when the stove is turned on, like that nail polish remover\
  \ that your mother asked to replace the cap but you forgot, like oil when you saut\xE8\
  \ mushrooms, or like money. \nNow I don't want to make you cry cause, money. \n\
  So let's get back to the sad story of me missing my flight. On the Paris airport\
  \ named after a very impressive man indeed, Charles De Gaulle, who helped France\
  \ get over the German occupancy and recover from WW2. How do I know that? No I didn't\
  \ have to google that. When I called the Francophile to tell her apprise her if\
  \ the situation, that's what she told me. Now let me recreate the whole scene and\
  \ introduce the Deus ex Machina (plural) - extremely cold weather, alone me reading\
  \ the train information board incorrectly from Versailles to Paris, me taking a\
  \ longer route via metro to the hotel, me misplacing the room keys, me not googling\
  \ the way to the airport in advance, torrents of rain and me running through it\
  \ getting drenched, me reaching the airport with an hour to spare, but me wasting\
  \ time to stand in a line to get the information about baggage check-in and of course\
  \ there's me, reaching the boarding site with 5 mins to departure, but they've closed\
  \ the boarding gates early. As you can clearly see, none of this was my fault. I\
  \ was just a pawn in the gods' larger scheme at work - to make start watching Peaky\
  \ Blinders finally. So that's what I did at the airport all night. I sat at the\
  \ Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris all night to binge watch and when the morning\
  \ came, spent my time riding in one bus to another to have one final look at Paris.\
  \ And the weather was finally nice. Indeed, it was sunny."
