Text: "A very hesitant me boarded an empty train at 5 in the morning. It was nail-biting\
  \ cold but the butterflies in my tummy kept me warm. \nThough I am very happy with\
  \ myself, I have never gone ona journey all by myself thanks to all my crazy friends.\
  \ But, today I was maybe only girl standing alone in the station boarding a train\
  \ to a destination I have been but once when I was really young. The Palace and\
  \ the beggar , a mighty palace and a ruggedly man sitting next to the throne room.\
  \ The irony of it stays with me to this day.\nThroughout the journey I kept staring\
  \ out like with the excitement of a really young child, the noise of the city slowly\
  \ died- the concrete jungle gave-away to trees and fields.  I got down at the railway\
  \ station I was met with two really hot TTs who was doing something like bouncers\
  \ checking out your passes.\nThen I took the most popular heritage talk from google\
  \ results. Starting my journey Mysore was the perfect mixture of Indian Royalty\
  \ and the gradual modernisation of our towns. The malls next to the tiffany. The\
  \ blue and yellow shades of royalty fading before the bright shades of fast food\
  \ giants. \nThe first place in the city was the palace, The magnificence of it all\
  \ was overwhelming. The walk was long and the heat was getting to me but the Decors\
  \ made of ivory, the architectural beauty and intricate murals on each wall and\
  \ ceiling made me stop and just breathe in. They were too beautiful for my crude\
  \ photography.\nNext in list was the museum with original paintings and works of\
  \ some incredible artists of the state. But I was greeted by a lonely building which\
  \ was so barren as a woman travelling alone I was a bit freaked out but Oh! The\
  \ paintings were perfect, the difference between great artists and artists is in\
  \ the very stroke of the brush.\nAs I continued walking, I let new places sink in,\
  \ one thought kept repeating in my head, hey this street must be somebody\u2019\
  s home, a path someone takes every day, she/he will walk through this path without\
  \ so much as a glimpse yet so aware of its beauty and familiarity, there are a few\
  \ streets like that for me back home, I look at it with a hope to know it the way\
  \ they do-  a kind of beauty only things you know very well holds. Like how your\
  \ best friend, you used to think was ugly when you first met, slightly growing on\
  \ you and now, you can only see them as beautiful, you can\u2019t explain the beauty\
  \ but god aren\u2019t they beautiful. Like the house you have lived in for a really\
  \ long time, i hated my house when i first came to live in it, I remember plotting\
  \ and screaming to get out of that wretched place but today it is home, today even\
  \ if it is dirty, unorganised and looks nothing like a house to anybody else, It\
  \ holds a place in my heart nothing else matches, it is my companion that one place\
  \ of security. It knows more of my stories than my incredibly beautiful friends.\
  \ This place even though distant gives me an assurance that only home holds, it\
  \ should be the striking resemblance of the two cities the competing elements of\
  \ royalty and modernisation at war.\nThe next on list was the very best cafe in\
  \ mysore in walking distance, this was slightly more frightening as an extremely\
  \ extroverted person with slight insecurities I have never taken myelf out to lunch.\
  \ As I sat myself down, my insecurities took over me for a minute but soon I started\
  \ enjoying the date  with the only person that mattered at the moment, me. I was\
  \ slightly happier and calmer.\nLast stop was the Zoo just that by then I had walked\
  \ a total of some 15kms and the zoo was around 10 km The first 5 were easy next\
  \ 5 was a gamble but there I saw the most striking part of the journey a lonely\
  \ albino black buck, isolated by the rest."
