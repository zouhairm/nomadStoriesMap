Text: "Three months ago, I went to Lithuania. Vilnius. The capital. A scowling city,\
  \ a city of sleet and strange music, a city filled with markets and churches and\
  \ sodden figures walking around with their eyes fixed upon their feet. I noticed\
  \ this, the aversion people had towards raising their gaze, on the first day. For\
  \ some reason, nobody (aside from fellow tourists, identifiable by their non-participation\
  \ in this habit) felt the urge to glance up and examine the environment through\
  \ which they were proceeding. \n\nUpon being delivered to our accommodation, our\
  \ taxi driver indicated vaguely to the street we were standing in and offered us\
  \ the following advice: 'good luck.' I took this meant that we were evidently staying\
  \ in a rough area. The walk we went on the next morning to buy groceries confirmed\
  \ my suspicion. Most of the windows in the buildings we passed were covered with\
  \ sodden cardboard, and the ones with glass still intact were invariably  marked\
  \ by graffiti. This abundance of graffiti, it must be admitted, also applied to\
  \ every section of the city we visited. There was such a massive amount the stuff\
  \ garlanding the walls and alleys of even the poshest areas that I was half ready\
  \ to believe that it was obligatory, mandated by the government. You couldn't go\
  \ more than thirty seconds without seeing a stretch of brickwork colonised by a\
  \ spray-painted depiction of a huge, looming face.\n\nIn spite of the weather and\
  \ our initial wariness towards the place, I can state with confidence that the trip\
  \ ranks above any of the conventional holiday destinations I have previously flown\
  \ to. Vilnius was unique, from its architecture, a overlapping jumble of Gothic\
  \ and soviet styles, to its inhabitants, entertaining and warm once you genuinely\
  \ made the effort of engaging with them.\n\nEvery night - and this wasn't a conscious\
  \ decision - we ended up a bar called 'Snekutis.' It means 'snake' in English, although\
  \ the only creature present in the establishment wasn't a snake but a hideously\
  \ deformed goldfish they kept next to a window looking out onto the Bohemian district.\
  \ The goldfish did the same thing over-and-over-again, like an elaborately programmed\
  \ toy: drift to the bottom of the tank and swallow a mouthful of pebbles, then swim\
  \ back to the top to retch them back out several minutes later. The sight of the\
  \ goldfish convulsing as the pebbles were expelled from it was quite hypnotic, in\
  \ a faintly sickening sort of way."
