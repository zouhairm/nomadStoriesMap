Text: "The night sky was partly cloudy, thundering every few seconds and it was only\
  \ one night from New Moon. All the lights on the beach had been turned off and it\
  \ was pitch dark. The lightning continually broke the spells of darkness, painting\
  \ the landscape of the Kudle beach, nestled in between the hills of the Western\
  \ Ghats on three sides and the Arabian sea in front, in hues of gray as if painting\
  \ on the canvas of sky with charcoal. Alishan slept in the tent. Indian Pariah dogs\
  \ sat on either side of Abhijeet and I, as we lay on the cover of the tent, trying\
  \ to locate the constellations as Chris Martin crooned in the background \u201C\
  Lights will guide you home and ignite your bones\u2026.\u201D. Hundreds of ghost\
  \ crabs strolled the beach, away from the hustle and bustle humans bring during\
  \ the daytime. \nThe autorickshaw-walah dropped us, after a 20-minute ride on kucha\
  \ road, at a desolate Y juncture of thin paths descending into the wilderness. Thankfully,\
  \ the sun was still hidden in the nimbus. We needed to go down 60 meters to the\
  \ beach. Surely, we couldn\u2019t get lost. We followed one of the paths, pushing\
  \ away the low hanging leaves of devil tree and avoiding thorny bushes, and as we\
  \ did, we walked further away from the route on the GPS. We turned around, took\
  \ the other path. Same result. We re-returned to the paths, descending further each\
  \ time, till we heard the sound of water splashing on the rocks. A semblance of\
  \ a path looked like it went all the way down. Et voila, it was deserted! It was\
  \ 3 in the afternoon and we hadn\u2019t devoured a single morsel of food. We found\
  \ an old lady who didn\u2019t speak our tongue. But everyone understands the universal\
  \ language of hunger. We dug into the sweetest bananas and calmed our nerves. The\
  \ sea was full of vigor. As we got up to move, old lady\u2019s pet German Shepherd\
  \ decided we were trespassing and chased us through the red chili plantations. \n\
  We waded our way to next beach, carefully stepping on one calcified limestone after\
  \ another. \n\u201CAaahhhh\u201D, shrieked Abhijeet. I reflexively turned around\
  \ from photographing the rocks which resembled miniature version of Emyn Muil from\
  \ the Lord of the Rings. I watched him fling his mobile onto the sand and then the\
  \ phone submerging in the oncoming wave. I turned to him, confused, only to find,\
  \ in horror, his little finger twisted at an unnatural angle. Alarmed, he pushed\
  \ on his pinkie and set it right, all in the matter of a second! It was supposed\
  \ to be a straightforward beach trek of a meagre 800 meters, from Half Moon Beach\
  \ to Paradise or Full Moon Beach, covering Moonlight and \u2018Small Hell Beach\u2019\
  \ on the way. Irony much?\nStill no one else around. The waves rose very quickly\
  \ and dangerously on these beaches, and receded violently. The way to the next beach\
  \ was up the hill. We walked along a winding path by the cliff, passing one breathtaking\
  \ view after another. Water splashed high as it destroyed the rocks. Graffiti artwork\
  \ were executed on the abandoned rocks by \u2018Tona\u2019. Finally, we made it\
  \ to Paradise. It looked annihilated. Several palm trees with about 3 feet of roots\
  \ exposed, and some broken in half. Another 5 humans had made it to that beach from\
  \ other direction. Sunset was in 30 minutes and we needed to cover 800 meters to\
  \ make it to a tiny settlement, Belekan. It had taken us 270 minutes to traverse\
  \ the first 800. We started to diverge away from the path, again, even ended up\
  \ in a protected area, but managed to make it out. \nNow, all that separated us\
  \ from the village was about 30 feet of marshland. Then a dog ran over it. It was\
  \ just wet soil and silt. It had been that kind of a day. We settled on artificial\
  \ ripraps, feeling elated, grand, and victorious, literal translation of our names\
  \ in our mother tongues, as we munched on the tastiest pieces of egg bread toast,\
  \ and sipped on the sweetest water, while the sun set in the Arabian sea."
