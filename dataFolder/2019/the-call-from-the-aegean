Text: "As I always do when it comes to writing about a real travel experience of mine,\
  \ I am going to tell the story about my surprise with Turkey, which is something\
  \ I did not expect to find in that way.\n\nEverything started with an european scholarship\
  \ that I got in High School, giving me the opportunity to travel for free to Izmir,\
  \ one of the biggest cities in Turkey. I was about fourteen years old and I don\u2019\
  t know what I was thinking about exactly, but for sure I was not expecting the country\
  \ to be that paradisiac or that \u201Cnormal\u201D\u2026 that \u201Coccidental\u201D\
  . \n\nI realice now how uncultured I was back then. I didn\u2019t even looked for\
  \ anything about this place before landing there, but I do not regret this either,\
  \ because it made that trip more interesting. The first thing that we saw once we\
  \ were in the big city was a huge bright sea in front of us, behind a curtain full\
  \ of palm trees next to the promenade. Can you believe I did not know the name of\
  \ the Aegean until I was back in Spain? The name of the sea was something that sounded\
  \ so foreign to me, like the kind of things you read in the Bible. It could have\
  \ been the very first thing that connected my mind to Greece, but I did not realice\
  \ the relationship between these two countries until I saw some tensions between\
  \ the greek students and the local ones. And of course, all the ruins in Ephesus,\
  \ but that is not that shocking and definitely, not that unknown (but of course,\
  \ Ephesus was a big, big thing. For me it was like visit two countries at the same\
  \ time). \n\nIn summary, that paradisiac view did not match to the things the history\
  \ books and the News used to tell about that place. Nor that landscape, nor that\
  \ people. They were not wearing kerchiefs, they were not stearing weirly at us,\
  \ they were not being\u2026 the way I thought they were going to be. I am not ashamed\
  \ of confessing that I was a bit afraid of what I could find, but against all my\
  \ expectations, I found young people like me. Girls and boys laughing histerically\
  \ in the corridors, shily flirting in a hilarious way, asking a lot of questions,\
  \ going out to the shopping mall and grabbing our hands in order to guide us.\n\n\
  However, as the days went by, we could start seeing some details that revealed differences.\
  \ Anyway, this was not bad at all, precisely it was the most curious aspect. We\
  \ were living in turkish families\u2019 homes, where you could be in their true\
  \ atmosphere. One day in the afternoon, I saw my sister from another mother\u2018\
  s grandma praying in the middle of the living room, bending down in an extremely\
  \ way, absorbed in a very spiritual mood that no one can understand but them. In\
  \ the distance, I could hear \u201Cthe call\u201D from the Mosque, which sounded\
  \ several times a day and coordinated itself with the twilight. They name Atat\xFC\
  rk in their prayers, as well as in every other conversation. Can we, spanish nation,\
  \ understand that devotion for a politician, a president?\n\nBut there were other\
  \ things apart from this: even though all the girls were very similar to us and\
  \ were not extremely devotee; even though they wear as many skirst as us and didn\u2019\
  t even care about hair removal because they were feeling freedom itself, they were\
  \ hiding some love and public behaviour issues that were very religious. In those\
  \ moments, I kept remembering something my sister told me: that no one can have\
  \ real knowledge of a foreign place when you travel as a tourist. You need to live\
  \ there, just to understand how deep are some ideas in other countries. \n\nAnd\
  \ what is left to say about the magic of Turkey? Well, you could see people dancing\
  \ in circles in a place guarded by soldiers with big shotguns, while some women\
  \ were predictin the future in the remains of bitter coffees, revealing their eternal\
  \ mystic personality. Nevertheless, they always welcomed our skepticism with a smile."
