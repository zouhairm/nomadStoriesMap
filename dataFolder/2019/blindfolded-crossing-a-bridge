Text: "Y, a 27 year old woman, doesn\u2019t know what a camel is.  She was from Tibet,\
  \ and due to the political conditions, she has not been able to leave country or\
  \ even to seek information about anything that might be happening outside her border\
  \ line. Her only connection to the outside is the tourists she is happily guiding\
  \ to get as close as possible to the majestic Mt Everest. I was lucky to find myself\
  \ in her group and to learn from her what wearing a blindfold feels like. You could\
  \ see in her eyes the thirst she had for knowledge, but the fear that also governed\
  \ her. \n\nWhen we arrived at Tibet, Y was already waiting for us, and I could tell\
  \ from her exited  waving  that she was eager to meet people from the outside world.\
  \ The first thing she told us was to be careful, given the fact that we were being\
  \ recorded in the van and that most of the time \u201Cthey\u201D where listening\
  \ to our conversations. \n\nAnd with this, the expedition began. She walked us around\
  \ majestic temples and towns where people would look at us with wide open eyes,\
  \ curious of where we might come from. While walking through the temples I could\
  \ tell the importance religion has in her life and that this has also been the stone\
  \ that has kept her going every day. She would very gently explain to us what religion\
  \ meant to her and her people and we would slowly fall in love with her country.\
  \  She would joke and tell us stories about the places we had visited, and later\
  \ at night before going to bed she would happily listen with wide ears our stories\
  \ about the places we have seen around the world. When telling her our stories she\
  \ would be impatiently asking questions to get as much information as she could,\
  \ and sometimes she would look at the ground trying to regain her hopes for a future\
  \ full of knowledge and away from the Chinese repression. \n\nWe left the Tibet\
  \ through the bridge that divides Nepal and China. While we were crossing the bridge\
  \ and waving goodbye, I could see her hopes slowly fading away, knowing that she\
  \ would never be able to cross that bridge herself. Being blindfolded from a globalized\
  \ world nowadays is something most of us can\u2019t even imagine, but seeing it\
  \ so closely only made me wonder what the future might bring and where we would\
  \ arrive. But, at the same time, I was glad to find out people like Y are fighting\
  \ to take that fold from their eyes and to fight against a repressive system. I\
  \ don\u2019t know if I will ever see her again, but I\u2019m sure she will keep\
  \ fighting for knowledge and for truth and that someday she might cross that bridge\
  \ herself."
