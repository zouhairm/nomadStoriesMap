Text: "What do you like to do on your birthday? Be around family? Travel somewhere\
  \ inspiring? Nice weather? There are so many options for you if you have the time\
  \ and the resources. \n\nI decided to travel to Sedona, Arizona. My immediate family\
  \ is across the country in North Carolina. I didn\u2019t have much time, a day and\
  \ a half to be exact. I didn\u2019t have much money, what with being a recent graduate\
  \ who\u2019s still on the search for that special something, while working a few\
  \ part-time odd jobs just to scrape by. With this in mind, a 2-and-a-half-hour drive\
  \ to Sedona seemed just in my short-armed reach. \n\nWell, as per usual, practically\
  \ nothing, hardly a single morsel, stayed true to the plan. I made this plan, tentative,\
  \ to do a hike that was raved about on Google (the Brins Mesa trail), explore the\
  \ peace park I\u2019ve seen captured nicely on Instagram, head to a local brewery,\
  \ and grab a delicious, but not over-priced dinner. Instead, the hike was packed\
  \ to the brim, no parking for miles, something I found unexpected on December 27th,\
  \ the day before my birthday. With pouts, grievances, and thoughts of what I\u2019\
  d miss, we head to the next things on my list: the Amitabha Stupa & Peace Park.\
  \ \n\nI was overjoyed to experience this park and it did not disappoint. Upon entering,\
  \ the trail weaves through luscious trees garnished with waves of colored flags.\
  \ Each flag had a peaceful message written on it, sure to bring serenity and harmony\
  \ to one\u2019s troubled mind and soul. The trail opens to a large clearing filled\
  \ with a bronze buddha statue, a group of three spinning canisters with instructions\
  \ to spin on your own in a circle, and offerings spread around. This place felt\
  \ special to me. How many had stood in this exact spot? Wondered in this spot about\
  \ peace, religion, hope, and anything that could cross a tired soul\u2019s mind?\n\
  \nWaning through the trail among small benches under branches, more flags and trinkets,\
  \ we stumbled straight into a trail. Well, it wasn\u2019t the one I initially wanted,\
  \ but I figured it\u2019ll do. We weren\u2019t sure the name of the trail, and where\
  \ it led, but anywhere in Sedona has to be beautiful, right?\n\nRight. This trail\
  \ led us through and on top of the red rocks. Even one special huge rock with a\
  \ simple climb up led us to a gloriously full view of the city and the rocks. Complete\
  \ with a short and erratic dance party and some more scenery to make your jaw drop,\
  \ we head back and decide to take another trail up called Chimney\u2019s Pass. Two\
  \ minutes into the hike we realized it was a bit more intense of an incline. But\
  \ right at this moment, where we might have accepted defeat, a few snowflakes trickled\
  \ in front of our faces. The first snowfall of the season in this dry, desert land.\
  \ A gracious gift from God to give us that exuberance needed to complete the hike.\
  \ A little divergence from the path led us up these skyscrapers for rocks with an\
  \ even better viewing point. \n\nTake me where people look like ants so I can remind\
  \ myself how fragile life is, how every action might have a consequence, but does\
  \ it really matter in the end? What really matters is the people you choose to spend\
  \ this beautiful life with. Sedona was the perfect choice for birthday shenanigans,\
  \ even though the ones I love most couldn\u2019t be a part of my birthday, this\
  \ was the next best thing."
