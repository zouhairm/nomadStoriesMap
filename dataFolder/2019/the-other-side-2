Text: "Auroville\n\n       Come... i will take you to a space which most of the people\
  \ wonder and wander to experience. Yes its a space and not just a place, because\
  \ everyone living, working or walking there do their part of the work. It is an\
  \ utopian idea which is seen in existence in this most complex and diverse country,\
  \ transforming once a barren land to a dense jungle.It was a journey of findings\
  \ which were never thought about, never spoken about..Yet an unimaginable force\
  \ of magnetism was there in that space, that even if you meet people outside this\
  \ space after 50 years, they will be still feeling that force. \n      In the dense\
  \ vegetation of auroville, there are patches, roads and people; you come across\
  \ to every single time as if you are going in a loop. this loop seems visually same\
  \ but its a wheel of transformation.  And then while working there...\n\n      \
  \ Little by little piece by piece, we built it all tree by tree. This was the time\
  \ when we learnt the most from the thorns of the long bamboos which we cut with\
  \ no cost. It was tough and the ground was rough. We carried the bamboos on the\
  \ shoulder, passed it over the next tree by standing on the boulder. Day after day\
  \ it was getting ready... We took the bamboos higher and higher and the platform\
  \ was steady till we got the rush of wind.\n      Oh how can I forget. This was\
  \ the time our dear friends, red ants always tried to create trouble for us or rather\
  \ we were created trouble for them, always there was a fight on a bite. It was almost\
  \ done just a roof that remained to take a form and there stuck a storm. The wind\
  \ was hauling and the rain water splashing. We felt it will rip everything apart,\
  \ and tomorrow we do a new start. Trees were moving, they bend and still there was\
  \ whole night to be spend... we were worried but not afraid... It was the time nature\
  \ tested our structure... and we survived the storm. Mornings were spent in the\
  \ farm, with lots of hard work on the arms. Weeding, planting, harvesting all time\
  \ which ends with delicious breakfast on the line. Days went on with the friends\
  \ I cared and the stories I shared. And then it was the time when the north winds\
  \ called and I move on breaking imaginaries that were walled."
