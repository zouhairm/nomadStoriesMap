Text: "That day my feet were dangling off a cliff, while I was sitting in another\
  \ corner from those two. We were separated to sit at different corners. I was thinking\
  \ how we will be laughing about this once we were out of here. \n\nThe aravali's\
  \ are oldest range of fold mountains in India running approximately 430 miles from\
  \ Delhi through southern Haryana, Rajasthan and ending in Gujrat. Though there isn't\
  \ much wildlife to be seen sometimes leopard sighting are reported. The Wikipedia\
  \ article states presence of striped hyenas, golden jackals, leopards, civets, but\
  \ the only \"fauna\" I've encountered are nilgais and deers. But the main reason\
  \ I visit these mountains is due to its history. Years ago the aravali range were\
  \ subject to illegal mining. The mining was banned by the government but damage\
  \ was done. The mining resulted in huge craters which were flooded resulting in\
  \ disbalance of watertable and ultimately chaos. But these artificial lakes are\
  \ magnificent to watch. \nIt was in high school I realised my interest in photography,\
  \ we used to hike to nearby areas to photograph and sometimes free climb small cliffs.\
  \ We already had been to the places nearby as far as we could go and there was nothing\
  \ much left to see anyway. So the plan that day was to hike further into the jungle\
  \ to find the second lake which was deeper and appeared to be bigger than what we\
  \ used to visit on Google maps. \n\nI thought 'as a last resort I'll have to push\
  \ him downhill and run for my life or something'. I got up still admiring the overlooking\
  \ mountains of aravali, but this was no time to enjoy the scenery. I walked towards\
  \ the guy who was keeping us hostage, \"It's been 3 hours now, and we don't have\
  \ anything else to give you, let us go\", I said. \"Shut up\", he said. I thought\
  \ 'how the hell did we even let this guy take us hostage, we could've taken him\
  \ down, we very well outnumber him by 3:1'. But then I looked at the thin dude holding\
  \ the stick and remembered that he was signalling for help when he saw us and we\
  \ heard royal enfield's roar on nearby trail tracks somewhere. We didn't know how\
  \ outnumbered we were and so talked this guy into greed that if he were not to call\
  \ anyone he can keep our stuff to himself. \"I can't let you go, this guy is a Muslim\
  \ and you're here to kill cows and take them in the bag with you\", he said pointing\
  \ to Moin and the knife he found on me. Until that point I never thought this could\
  \ go south like this. Hindu Muslim riots are pretty serious in these parts of the\
  \ country, and recently there were reports of cow slaughtering in nearby villages.\
  \ Managing to not change expressions I pointed to Tushar and said, \"look at him,\
  \ he's a Hindu and that too of the highest caste, are you out of your mind?\" And\
  \ before he could process, \"do you have any idea what religion I belong to? I'm\
  \ a Christian and we are not supposed to touch these sacred animals\" my heart pounding\
  \ out of my chest on the bluff I just pulled hoping the uneducated crook would fall\
  \ for it. \"That is okay but I will have to report you to police\" he said with\
  \ a convinced face using scare tactics. And before I could say anything Moin jumped\
  \ in \"so be it, my uncle is the sarpanch of your village. I'll get us out in no\
  \ time\". The guy baffled by Moins comment asked me \"is he telling the truth?\"\
  \ \"Do you want to find out?\" I said trying to be fierce. \"Okay\" he said and\
  \ moved to a side for better reception trying to call someone. We grabed the opening\
  \ we got and I eyed Tushar who was sitting in another corner. All three of us ran\
  \ into the bushes. We ran for what felt like a hundred miles through bushes and\
  \ thorns, scratched and bruised we came out of the woods on a highway. Waved our\
  \ hands for the first car that passed."
