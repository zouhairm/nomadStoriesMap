Text: "It has been one of those trips where I felt things were odd from the very beginning.\
  \ The booking did not go through despite several attempts and I had to arrange for\
  \ a friend on the other side of the planet to send the funds for payment on my behalf.\n\
  \nFinally, we embarked to our next destination of our world travel, to Cancun and\
  \ a beautiful Golf and Resort hotel. I was looking forward to a few luxurious days\
  \ relaxing on the beach with my two kids after months of travels together all around\
  \ the world.\n\nThe day we arrived at the hotel the sea had clear turquoise water,\
  \ palm trees softly swayed in the wind. The resort displayed an abundance and luxury\
  \ we rarely had seen before. Our room was overlooking the sea.\n\nWe enjoyed the\
  \ feeling of happiness that comes along with sunshine, fresh sea air, free time,\
  \ a deep blue sky and abundant colors everywhere.The wind had noteably picked up\
  \ but the sky was clear and we had fun in the water and walked along the beach without\
  \ paying much attention to the weather.\n\nTwo days later, we drove a distance to\
  \ Chitchen Itza. In the evening, the pyramid light show got canceled due to the\
  \ increasingly strong wind and an electricity short cut. \n\nInstead of fireworks,\
  \ we saw the thousands of sparkles of fireflies in the dark. It was magical!\n\n\
  Arriving back in the hotel that night, we were issued with a warning that a hurricane\
  \ was coming and the hotel would keep guests further updated. \nAt 3 am we were\
  \ advised to lock our documents into the safe deposit box and leave our things in\
  \ the enclosed bathroom. \nThe hotel got evacuated at 5am with multiple travel buses.\
  \ We were not allowed to take any belongings with us apart from a small bag. \n\n\
  Our shelter was a low built primary school complex with flat concrete buildings\
  \ and nailed up windows. The doors were nailed close with wooden planks, twenty\
  \ five people per room inside, We stayed on thin sun lounge mattresses back to back\
  \ on the floor, without sanitary facilities, only plastic buckets. We had no light\
  \ nor electricity and little to no food. Water bottles were rationed.\n\nThe hurricane\
  \ came in, stayed for two days, changed direction, stayed for another three days,\
  \ before it moved on. The screeching noises and roars around us were truly frightening.\
  \ My small booklight run out of batteries after two days. \n\nThe devastation after\
  \ we finally came out of our shelters after five days was enormous. A  tanker was\
  \ on the street, the area flooded up to the hips, military moved in, locals looted\
  \ the shops, nerves layed blank.\n\nEverything looked like in a war zone, naked\
  \ wires dangling in the air.\nThe beaches, the solid beach restaurants, entire buildings\
  \ were gone. I saw photos of the hotel lobby and rooms being empty to the naked\
  \ concrete, apart from the suitcases locked in the bathroom and the sheer curtains\
  \ fluttering in the wind. The town and area were distroyed, the airport closed.\n\
  \nWe finally made it out on a bus, driving through flooded areas, being half emerged\
  \ in water.\n\nOur 19h bus journey took us to the next airport town, ready and able\
  \ to accommodate five hundred natural catastrophe survivors from our hotel. We arrived\
  \ at 4 am in the morning and it was chaos. Finally we were all accommodated to our\
  \ rooms, it felt like heaven.\n\nThe next day, most people flew immediately out\
  \ to their respective home countries. \nWe stayed on and waited for our luggage\
  \ to arrive. It contained all we had at the time. It would take one week until we\
  \ finally too, could leave.\n\nThe most memorable experience was that my little\
  \ son learnt how to play baseball in the eye of the hurricane, when we could leave\
  \ the rooms for a few hours.\n\nThe hotel did a fantastic job to keep the guests\
  \ safe, to provide food, transport and accommodation during a severe crisis.\n\n\
  Hurricane Wilma at the time was the most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded\
  \ in the Atlantic basin, and the most intense tropical cyclone recorded in the Western\
  \ Hemisphere."
