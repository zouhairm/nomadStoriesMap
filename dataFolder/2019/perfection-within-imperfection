Text: "As a political scientist, studying a Country's culture and traditions has been\
  \ always one of my passions. Understanding the reality, its causes and history becomes\
  \ a trip before the real journey. As a passionate for languages, it becomes even\
  \ more interesting when I have the possibility to discover a place beyond its physical\
  \ structures and through its people. The story I wish to tell here is important\
  \ to me since the moment I understood the importance of living a Country through\
  \ its cultural manifests, in this case: S\xE3o Paulo's carnival.\n\nWhen I was in\
  \ my fourth year at the University (I am from Colombia) I decided to travel as an\
  \ internship student to S\xE3o Paulo, Brazil. Obviously, I planned my trip in order\
  \ to have the chance to be at the Carnival. Even though I had never been to this\
  \ country, I've had a previous knowledge about this celebration thanks to the portuguese\
  \ lessons I took in school (for 3 consecutive semesters). However, I never imagined\
  \ the real dimension and its true meaning... living it was another experience.\n\
  \nEveryone - at some point - has imagined a carnival... perfect bodies, feathers,\
  \ glitter, dance, music and color. This idea is not far from reality, however, when\
  \ you really get to live this festive moment, you comprehend there is more beyond\
  \ it. First of, a carnival is not something you can improvise... its no improptu\
  \ event, it requires - at least - 1 year's in advance planning. Every samba academy\
  \ prepares, rehearses and coordinates to do outstanding presentations in order to\
  \ have enough points to be elected and classify to the carnival. Second, every and\
  \ each one of the people who participate at the carnival (minus the Garotas, who\
  \ are the professional dancers) buy their costumes and commit to attend the rehearsals.\
  \ Third, the carnival happens in two modes: the sambodromo (which is a samba - version\
  \ stadium) and the streets. The first one, is where the samba academies compete\
  \ to become the winners of that year's carnival, and the second one is more of a\
  \ colective kinda- type of popular party that occurs between 3-4 streets that are\
  \ closed during the occasion. Both types are incredible. At the sambodromo you get\
  \ to see the gigantic carriges that hold dozens of people who dance to the rythm,\
  \ the magnificent Garotas shaking their bodies at the drums' beat and the incredible\
  \ color display. In the streets you experience a generalized adrenaline rush accompanied\
  \ by the heat, the multitude and the celebration mood.\n\nI could go 300 pages long\
  \ just explaining the greatness of this moment... however, the most important thing\
  \ I would like to say - and that really stroke me - is that there is perfection\
  \ within the imperfection. I learned from the brazilians that \"perfect\" does not\
  \ exist, does not have room and will never be a \"must\" in this celebration. Being\
  \ able to see and enjoy the variety of bodies and color freely (and without any\
  \ social constraints regarding \"aesthetics\" or \"beauty standards\") was mesmerizing.\
  \ Each person is in its own celebration, not caring for judgements and that's what\
  \ makes this moment great. \n\nTravelling is not only a stamp in a passport, it\
  \ is also the biggest and most profound lesson one might have. I hope this story\
  \ may help me transmit how important it is for me to be part of social and cultural\
  \ manifests as a tourist. Those are the moments when you learn about diversity,\
  \ inclusion and even, different ways to enjoy a regular month such as march (in\
  \ the case of the carnival). \n\nThank you for taking the time to read my story,\n\
  Hope to hear back from you!"
