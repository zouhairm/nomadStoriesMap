Text: "The days were hot and humid in noon, but dry cold with hum of mosquitoes marching\
  \ at night. There was no electricity, left alone the internet. The only way to access\
  \ the area was by walking through an old wooden road with no more than two meter\u2019\
  s width. The water rich with grease, layered nicely on the surface of all-purpose\
  \ bucket; to bath, laundry, and drink. \nAt first, I wanted to scream \u201Chome\u201D\
  \ to the top of my lungs. But home was 3.928 km away at the time and I already pledged\
  \ myself to face any sort of challenge bestowed upon me. \nIt was a semester break\
  \ of 2014 when I took two-month social service program to Eme, Teluk Bintuni, deep\
  \ far to the remote of West Papua. My job was to carry out an education program\
  \ called Sekola Bintuni. Our mission was to help kids to develop their soft skills\
  \ with intercultural teachings like leadership, teamwork, diversity, and tolerance.\
  \ \nAlong with 19 persons who joined the program, I began the journey. We spent\
  \ five days sailing the sea toward Sorong, then went through another day joining\
  \ a local tug boat to cross the bay of Bintuni until we reached Eme. By the dock,\
  \ we met a woman called Mama Siren. She was actually the only teacher in Eme\u2019\
  s Kindergaten, the sole available school in Eme.\nShe took us to the village with\
  \ population no more than 70 people. As soon as we arrived, the tribal chief greeted\
  \ us. Shockingly, he explained that most of the Eme\u2019s could not speak Bahasa\
  \ Indonesia. Women, men, and children gathered as the chief introduce me and my\
  \ friends as some college youngsters that came from town to teach the kids about\
  \ \u201Cthings\u201D. \nLater on we commence the class for Eme\u2019s kids for every\
  \ noon until the sun set. They were terrified at first and prone to get violent\
  \ when we got too close. Luckily we had Mama Siren as an interpreter (even a shield\
  \ sometime). They need almost three weeks to finally accept us and started to really\
  \ curious about new things we do together. Thus, opening their heart to stranger\
  \ and strange stories about life on the other side of the shore.\nAs we grew closer\
  \ to the tribe, we thought it would be nice to have new activity that everyone could\
  \ join. Hence, I had an idea to create a small cooking workshop based on my recipe\
  \ of fish meatballs. I thought it will suit their needs as fisheries was their main\
  \ source of livelihood. We chose the night before my return to hometown as the D-day.\
  \ \nSurprisingly, everyone was indeed showing up. It was rather chaotic as we did\
  \ not expect everyone to come. Not to mention that we still talking in a kind of\
  \ \u201Crandom sign language\u201D. Yet at the end, we did manage to have fun and\
  \ wrapped the event with tasty barbecue afterwards.\nI remembered how loud we laughed\
  \ and countless times we clinked our glasses that night. My stomach was full so\
  \ I decided to sat by the river to calm it down. All of a sudden, bunch of my students\
  \ ran toward me and then hugged me tight with smile hanging in their ears and said,\n\
  \u201CDelicious! Meatballs delicious!\u201D\nMama Siren giggled behind them, teasing\
  \ me as their ran and shouted the word \u201Cdelicious\u201D around me. Surprise\
  \ and touched, I laughed my heart out while at the same time could not stop my tears\
  \ from dropping.\nSince then, every time I see fish meatballs in supermarket or\
  \ street vendor, flashes of days in Eme emerges. Not the weird taste water, labile\
  \ weather, mosquitoes, nor even life without internet. In contrast, it is the feeling\
  \ of warm sensation in my chest as I remember the Eme\u2019s stood by the dock with\
  \ teary smile. And while I scope a spoonful of fish meatballs, the Eme\u2019s will\
  \ always be there. Waving me a goodbye as they see me leaving in wet from crossing\
  \ their river, heading to a trip back home to Jakarta."
