Text: "The eve of Christmas was approaching. The decision to have a different experience\
  \ to celebrate it, more than 10000 km away from home, made me to want to materialize\
  \ a dream, the dream of Istanbul, visit the indomitable ancient capital of the Ottoman\
  \ Empire, a symbol of the conjugation between East and West, and contemplate the\
  \ vivid representation of the greatness of Turkish civilization.\n\nThe arrival,\
  \ early in the morning, was conventional, my expectations were the only ornament.\
  \ A highly guarded airport was my welcome, it was not a surprise, the internal and\
  \ external conflict had worsened, and the frequent terrorist attacks were hounding\
  \ the tranquility of the city. Received by the characteristic gray sky of the Turkish\
  \ winter, by a cold and dry climate, but very warm if humanity is about, I set out\
  \ to cross the Bosphorus Strait to arrive at Taksim, the historic and touristic\
  \ area of the city, home of the foreigners in the metropolis.\n\nRestaurants, shops,\
  \ embassies, theaters and a large crowd filled the space, an area with a strong\
  \ western influence, with a nostalgic and bohemian tinge, boisterous but charming,\
  \ the perfect area to understand and fall in love with Turkish mysticism. Wandering\
  \ through the backstreets, in search of a place to settle down, I came to a blue\
  \ wall with a hostel ad, no luxuries, only a rusty door. When I opened it, some\
  \ stairs took me up to a rudimentary desk. A quick registration, cash payment, 25\
  \ Turkish lira - less than 5 euros - and a small room to hang out is all I remember\
  \ before meeting him.\n\nThere he was, silent, with a lost sight, a long and bulky\
  \ beard - the symbol of Turkish manhood - and disheveled hair. I greeted politely,\
  \ but only received a look of bewilderment in response; after a while, he returned\
  \ the greeting. I insisted on talking, maybe the kindness of a beginner impelled\
  \ me to start a conversation, after all, knowing the city should include knowing\
  \ its population too. Coming out of his trance he followed my attempt of interaction.\
  \ His name was Hasan, a 20-year-old Turkish soldier from Gaziantep. He had left\
  \ on leave and was in Istanbul to meet his sister. He had come from the east, near\
  \ the border with Syria, an area in conflict where the Islamic State -ISIS-, the\
  \ Kurdish nation and the Turkish army, three antagonistic armed wings, disputed\
  \ the domination of the region.\n\nEventually we started talking and the conversation\
  \ turned into a kind of interview. Without realizing, my curiosity had turned to\
  \ the issue of conflict. I had no notion of time, but maybe an hour or two was enough\
  \ to vanish from my mind all those images that Orhan Pamuk with his picturesque\
  \ narrative had implanted in my head. Slowly, my imagination turned red, the mentions\
  \ of tanks, bombings and a humanitarian crisis contrasted with that world of opulence\
  \ and distinction that I had just admired before entering that hostel. There was\
  \ a completely different reality in the other side of the country, something that\
  \ I could not have imagined to hear or know about, even in the worst of my expectations\
  \ about Istanbul.\n \nHasan carried on his back the weight of three deaths resulting\
  \ from a confrontation and had on his phone the photos of those bodies. I could\
  \ not decipher whether with only 20 years he had developed the necessary moral coldness\
  \ to observe them without repentance, or perhaps, at his early age, his psyche had\
  \ been broken enough to lose the least compassion that any of us had had in front\
  \ of a violation of the most fundamental right of all, the right to life. Hasan\
  \ never knew if the bodies were Kurds, militants of Islamic State or simple civilians.\
  \ Apparently, death, allied with the desire for survival of the combatants, wandered\
  \ and indiscriminately snatched at will the lives of those who circulated in that\
  \ valley of violence.\n\nIstanbul for me was a dream, the doorway to a reality full\
  \ of beauty and charm, however, after that encounter, I realized that reality is\
  \ not usually affable with everyone and beyond the dreams of some, lie the nightmares\
  \ of others."
