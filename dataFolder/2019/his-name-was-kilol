Text: "We got on the train at Nanu Oya with the intention of going to Hatton; the\
  \ place to take the bus to Nayathaniya and climb the more than five thousands steps\
  \ -as if we were climbing our way to heaven- that would take us to the top of Adam's\
  \ Peak. Sri Lanka is a beautiful island.\n\nThe train wagon was full of guys dressed\
  \ the same sitting really close, right next to the other, sometimes even over the\
  \ other. White cotton shirt and dark pants. No seats available on the third class\
  \ ride, so we had to leave our backpacks somewhere around. I saw a man sitting on\
  \ the door -best place to enjoy the journey- and sat next to him, with my feet hanging\
  \ out of the train. The two mint painted ceiling fans danced and turned at the same\
  \ time to lighten the air. My friend Merel took a picture of me while she was having\
  \ a chat with the dressed-alike boys that were standing at the door, they were asking\
  \ about her country. I listened to the conversation as I contemplated what it's\
  \ called one of the most beautiful train rides in the world for the second time:\
  \ warm green and bright nature passing in front on my eyes, the sound of that old-beautiful-Wes-Anderson-style\
  \ machine in my ears.\n\nAfter a while, we swapped places for Merel to sit down.\
  \ Standing again I chatted with the traveling companions: they were on a six-month\
  \ training to become policemen, already passing the fourth. As we talked, something\
  \ that I had never seen before came into my eyes: they were holding a phone so small\
  \ that it wasn\u2019t bigger than a thumb. They were not allowed to communicate\
  \ with their relatives while they were in training: \"Secret Phone\" they called\
  \ it.\n\nHis name was Kilol, he was 23 years old. His was from Hatton, so we were\
  \ heading to his hometown. He was also studying a bit of History and Economics.\
  \ He asked me about my country: if Chile was close to Brazil, and if we had good\
  \ soccer players; we also talked about cricket. Suddenly, he excused himself telling\
  \ me that he had to call his girlfriend. He put the secret phone against his ear,\
  \ under the beige beanie that he was wearing and said something as fast as sinhalese\
  \ is spoken. He hanged the phone and looked outwards, as if looking for something\
  \ into the green, in the present that appears in front of the eyes of whom travels\
  \ by train.\n\nWe arrived at Hatton and before we got off, Kilol was gone. Denis!\
  \ Denis! I heard him shout, as I lost sight of him. I looked through the platforms,\
  \ no sign of where he went. After a few minutes my friend Merel, taller than me,\
  \ tells me that she sees him and points where he was. I stood on my tiptoes and\
  \ saw him with his girlfriend, probably saying something sweet. They had used the\
  \ opportunity of his trip to Colombo for the Independence Day ceremony to see each\
  \ other for a few minutes at the train station. I did not ask him how long he had\
  \ not seen her before. We saw them smiling. We lost them out of sight again in between\
  \ the crowd."
