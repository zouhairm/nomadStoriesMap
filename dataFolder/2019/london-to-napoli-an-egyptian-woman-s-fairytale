Text: "London to Napoli: an Egyptian Woman's Fairytale  \n\nIt was a very usual day,\
  \ the 13th of April I recall. I woke up in my tiny student room and had this sudden\
  \ urge to just get up and leave Guildford. And Guildford for those of you who don't\
  \ know, is a small town around 34 minutes from London. It's peaceful with nothing\
  \ much to do, a castle, a chapel and a Witherspoons. I called my friend, a Persian\
  \ girl I know from back home, and the I didn't even bother to ask, I just told her:\
  \ Parnian, I will be there in an hour, make me something good to eat. Well, I am\
  \ never usually this straight forward but it was one of those \"YES TO EVERYTHING\
  \ DAY\". I packed a little backpack, I forgot to pack knickers. Awful I know. I\
  \ arrived to Parian's place around 5 pm, had a glass of ros\xE8 and a grilled cheese\
  \ (girl didn't make me anything). Around 9 pm, I looked at my friend who was half\
  \ drunk and half immersed in a Ben and Jerry's Phish Food tub,  and I just told\
  \ her to get dressed. Fast forward two hours later, I put on a jean skirt and a\
  \ pink shirt, I didn't have nightlife on my mind when I packed and my friend being\
  \ the Persian queen she is, dressed in Gucci head to toe. Oh well! We headed to\
  \ Soho, no plan on mind, just wandering and looking at people. Tourists everywhere!\
  \ At this point I had been  UK for 7 whole months, and I no longer considered myself\
  \ a tourist, bloody hell. Parnian and I notice a place that looks too chic, so many\
  \ lights and like moths drawn to light we just walk in. Parnian and I feel a strange\
  \ vibe, all the men look too good to be true, too handsome, too groomed. Is this\
  \ heaven? but we also notice that not one man has even batted an eye as we walked\
  \ in. Two men finally approach us, oh hi there..here we go. The men: you guys look\
  \ super cute together.. Oh.. yep it was a gay bar, my bad. New friends, alcohol,\
  \ hot men and music, what more can a girl ask for? As super tipsy as I was, I head\
  \ out with my friend for a cigarette, I notice a man walking towards me, too well\
  \ dressed, amazing smile, olive skin and....... hot man: hey baby, can I kiss you?\
  \ again it was a YES day, don't judge. Italian men, you have to check that off your\
  \ list ladies. \nTwo months later I am flying to Naples to meet his family, family\
  \ is everything to an Italian man, and I felt this passion as I stepped out of Naples\
  \ airport. A homeless man swearing opposite to the exit just giving you the most\
  \ perfect welcome to NAPOLI. Napoli is like beautiful chaos. You don't want to live\
  \ there, but you also don't want to leave it. A big warm house, I meet his mother\
  \ who asks me from the first meeting if I wouldn't let her see her grandchildren.\
  \ \"I am not a putana\"  I answer her. No one speaks English, but they insist if\
  \ they repeat the words and talk louder that I would understand. My man and I roam\
  \ the city on a scooter, grab an gelato from Manella.. Oh Manella, its an orgasm\
  \ basically. Then a pizza from Gino Sorbello, I think at this point I would have\
  \ said yes if he asked me to marry him, for Naples, he is a piece of Naples. Everything\
  \ seemed like a dream, an Egyptian girl, Muslim, studying in London, on a scooter\
  \ through Naples drunk in love. I gained 4 kgs in that week and a yeast infection.\
  \ Totally worth it."
