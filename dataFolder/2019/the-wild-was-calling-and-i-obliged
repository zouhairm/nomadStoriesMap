Text: "Until now, my friends had known me to be the human that carried a badge of\
  \ honor announcing, \u201CI don\u2019t own a TV\u201D, but on a wintry NYC night\
  \ in late February 2018, after being dazed by a dramatic hospitalization, and wrongful\
  \ termination from my job as a Marketing Director, I logged into my sister\u2019\
  s Netflix account and gave into watching Chef\u2019s Table\u2014Season 1 Episode\
  \ 3 Francis Mallmann. \n\nWhile watching, I listened intently to Mallmann\u2019\
  s poetic depiction of solitude in the wilderness; he spoke about how Patagonia became\
  \ the companion that understood his stubborn need for freedom at a profound level.\_\
  \n\nMore than personal thoughts, Mallmann\u2019s words were a prophetic narrative\
  \ that articulated the most intimate desires of my soul; they were the divine compass\
  \ that guided me towards the most transformative 23-days of my life trekking and\
  \ camping in the Argentine and Chilean Patagonia. \n\nThe wild was calling, and\
  \ I obliged.\_\_\n\n10 days after that evening I was en route to Patagonia (which\
  \ was by far the most remote part of earth I had ever traveled to), and even though\
  \ I hiked in Upstate New York on weekends, camping was not one of my life skills.\
  \ \n\nFor the next 23-days, I\u2019d learn to befriend me and to rely on every element\
  \ in nature. As I trekked each day, the speed of the wind, the sound of the water\
  \ streams and birds all became my guides. Here, I only had my 50-liter gamma red\
  \ Osprey Backpack with food and basic shelter, some maps, and my journal. No phone,\
  \ internet, warm running water, no fancy gym with Kiehl\u2019s lotion. Dried fruit\
  \ bars replaced the $25 dollar cocktails and Michelin Star dining.\_\_\n\nThe things\
  \ that could have provided pseudo comfort during this challenging time in my life\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be there. In my heart, I knew that this trip would allow me to take\
  \ an honest look within and that it would serve as the stepping stone that would\
  \ get me to my next level of personal growth\u2014and so it did.\_\n\nAs I acquainted\
  \ myself with the terrain on my 6-hour trek on Cerro Torre, I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but wonder if some rhyolite (volcanic rock) I noticed on this trail were fragments\
  \ of the 2011 eruption of the\_Cord\xF3n Caulle\_volcano in Chile. It was difficult\
  \ to fathom that these would have traveled 947 kilometers to get here but by the\
  \ 15th day of trekking, everything I ever deemed impossible became believable.\_\
  \n\nBy the 23rd night, I had conquered many of my fears, however; I would still\
  \ fall\_asleep prior to sunset as I never stopped being terrified of the Patagonian\
  \ darkness.\_\n\nAs I faced my greatest fears in Patagonia, I learned to trust myself,\
  \ life and nature in a different in capacity. It forced me to release any mental\
  \ resistance that would arise when the circumstances and conditions didn\u2019t\
  \ seem ideal and to surrender to and embrace whatever experience was unfolding before\
  \ me at that moment.\n\nPatagonia\u2019s beauty is enigmatic, and it reveals itself\
  \ to your eye\_over time. As you explore the multi-dimensional aspects of her personality\
  \ (based on her moody winds), you become devoted to her, and can\u2019t help but\
  \ be love-struck by her strength.\_\_\n\nI learned to live on the edge of the unknown,\
  \ and moment to moment. The wild called me, and I obliged."
