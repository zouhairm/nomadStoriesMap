Text: "Getting out of a breakup with a devastated soul and an aching heart, the only\
  \ feeling I could fathom was the urgent need for a fresh new beginning. And that\
  \ was my inner flame pushing me to get out from Australian borders and to take the\
  \ initiative of exploring a new world. \nThere I was in Tunisia. A foreign country\
  \ in Africa\u2019s northernmost point. \nA different culture, a new language that\
  \ I hardly spoke! What an exciting experience! \nI spent the first week exploring\
  \ the north of this exotic land. Sidi Bou Said was my first destination. A charming\
  \ clifftop paradise! It is endowed with natural, and cultural attractions. I still\
  \ remember how relaxing the walks I had in its alleyways were, all the while admiring\
  \ the unique architecture of this village. All houses were whitewashed with cleverly\
  \ painted windows and doors in a unique stunning blue! It just creates an inspiring\
  \ illusion that will take you to another world! You never get enough of this gorgeous\
  \ place. Above all, I still tell stories about the rejuvenating pause I had in the\
  \ Cafe des Delices while enjoying the unique sunset. My second destination was Tabarka\
  \ where I contemplated the beauty of huge mountains and beautiful coastlines. Hiking\
  \ was my favorite activity there! It feels as if I landed on an unspoiled land that\
  \ magically healed my soul. To this day, I can still see Tabarka\u2019s earth carpeted\
  \ with grass and jeweled with breathtaking flowers. \nThe National Bardo Museum\
  \ was also an interesting place to explore. There were collections of mosaics and\
  \ galleries that exhibit the glorious eras of Tunisian history, from prehistory\
  \ to the middle of the last century. Another mesmerizing historical monument to\
  \ witness is the El Djem Amphitheater. A standing proof of the richness of this\
  \ small country and an eminent reminder of the Roman empire. Climbing up the top\
  \ seating tiers will just trigger your imagination to film the battles that took\
  \ place below. \nFurthermore, no holiday in Tunisia is complete without going to\
  \ the Sahara and experiencing the thrill of camping and camel riding. The Southern\
  \ part of Tunisia has an irresistible charm which made it not just a favorite destination\
  \ for all the tourists but also a great location to film the well-known movie \u2018\
  \u2019Star Wars\u2019\u2019. During my stay, I was lucky enough to witness the international\
  \ Sahara Douz festival. It takes place every year at the end of November in the\
  \ city of Douz. An amazing celebration the ancient desert life, and perpetuation\
  \ of the thriving culture from one generation to another. People pour in from all\
  \ over the world just to attend this amazing festival. I stayed in the south for\
  \ four fantastic days that shall never be forgotten! \nThere was traditional food,\
  \ baked over open fires in Berber camps sites. You could enjoy the captivating melodies\
  \ coming from the surrounding Bedouin tents or sit through a collection of shows\
  \ I have never seen the likes of elsewhere, such as camel marathons and horse racing.\n\
  The stadium of Douz is always brimming with life during those four days. There is\
  \ a song in every heart, cheer in every face and spring in every step. The atmosphere\
  \ is also contagious, it was difficult not to join in on the spirit of the event\
  \ even the policemen on duty enjoy it.\nBefore I went back home I made sure to learn\
  \ how to cook all the delicious Tunisian dishes I tasted during my stay. In fact,\
  \ this country is a foodie paradise and their culture needs to be transmitted and\
  \ presented to the world. After spending two months in a foreign country, I opened\
  \ my own restaurant in Australia that served Tunisian food which was kindly appreciated\
  \ by Australians. This adventure truly exceeded my expectations, providing me with\
  \ not just the emotional healing I went out there seeking but also with a new job\
  \ that I have never dreamed of. \nTake your chance! Travel as much a possible maybe\
  \ you will discover a new talent or a golden opportunity is just waiting for you\
  \ on the other side."
