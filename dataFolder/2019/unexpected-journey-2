Text: "Unexpected Journey\nI am six months pregnant when the training assignment to\
  \ Melbourne came. I was worry and happy at the same. I asked my husband about this\
  \ and he only said as long as the doctor said yes. My doctor said that it wont be\
  \ a problem as long as there was no tiring activity. So I confirmed to go to training\
  \ for six weeks.\nA length of the trip form Jakarta to Melbourne took about six\
  \ hour and thirty minutes. I felt my adrenaline rush, could not wait to explore\
  \ a part of Melbourne city. \nIt still young afternoon when I arrive at apartment\
  \ in St. Yarra. I walked around neighborhood to find food and cafe. I found fast\
  \ food on the way so I sat and took a little dinner. The training would take eight\
  \ hours per day minus Saturday and Sunday. I wrote my bucket list. Despite the low\
  \ stamina because of my pregnancy, I still have to visit amazing place here. \n\
  After reviewed, these are five best place that I visit at the weekend.\n1.\tBeach\
  \ Road\nA journey was very fun. The road was neat and clear. Occasionally wide green\
  \ meadows were seen. I could also see the sea along the way. There were several\
  \ surfer take a change in a big wave at Bells Beach that time. The weather was too\
  \ cold for me. \nWe drove about thirty minutes from there and we found a little\
  \ cafe near the beach. I choose hot green tea latte and sandwich as it still in\
  \ my brunch time. It was delicious for my empty stomach. \n2.\tState Library of\
  \ Victoria\nI see this building several times when I cross nearby and in that time\
  \ I always want to visit this library. When I finally could came, it was very fascinating\
  \ to see such a big library with elegant interior. I could say that the place was\
  \ cozy to read, think and maybe you just want to be alone and drawn in a thousand\
  \ book. \n3.\tYara Valley\nI love chocolate. That\u2019s why I immediately said\
  \ yes to go to Yarra Valley. The chocolate processing method was one of attractiveness\
  \ they offer. There were so many variant of chocolate and many flavor that made\
  \ you drool. It felt like I want to taste every kind of chocolate there. Beside\
  \ the factory, there were a beautiful vast pasture.\n4.\tTwelve Apostles\nOne of\
  \ the amazing place of nature that I see, Twelve Apostles. We could see the view\
  \ from above of the sea coral stands long. Actually the coral was not twelve, probably\
  \ it has the story, I believe. Many tourist came and taking a picture while they\
  \ see a big waves below. We were at a safe distance to see.\n5.\tSt. Kilda Esplanade\
  \ Market\nOne day before my return schedule to my country, I visited a famous market\
  \ in town which located not far from my place. Public transportation in Melbourne\
  \ was run very well. You don\u2019t have to be afraid to stray because you can see\
  \ guidance of direction everywhere. You can take the map for free on the bus stop\
  \ or inside the bus. Even if you take a wrong way, you can just take the opposite\
  \ way. They have a clean public transportation which came on time.\n\nNot quite\
  \ a long time, I arrived at St. Kilda Esplanade Market. On a sunny Saturday, I see\
  \ around. There are many seller offered many goods, from gift and souvenirs to furniture\
  \ and jewelry as it state in their website. Behind this market, I see such a beautiful\
  \ view of park and port. The park was quite large to go cycling or just hang out\
  \ with some friends. You can rental a bike if you want to. Next to this location,\
  \ there are Luna Park, an amusement park. What a strategic place to visit.\nI am\
  \ so pleasure to be there. There were so many place that I haven\u2019t had time\
  \ to stop by. It seems like I have to come back one day."
