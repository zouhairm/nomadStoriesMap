Text: "How do you react if you hear the word 'Bangladesh'? Would you think of poverty?\
  \ Or would you think of it as an undeveloped country? By the way, has it ever happened\
  \ to you what you imagined totally contrasted with the reality? I bet yes. Let me\
  \ take you to the world of my imagination. It was late august of 2017 that I came\
  \ across an application for a Model United Nations which would be held in Dhaka\
  \ city, capital of Bangladesh. I was not certain if I would be able to go there;\
  \ however, I still applied. The main reason I planned to visit Bangladesh was because\
  \ my sister was studying there. I wanted to surprise her with a sudden meeting.\
  \ I began my visa application. I booked the tickets. My first flight was from my\
  \ hometown in Kabul, Afghanistan, to Dubai, and then from Dubai to Dhaka. I felt\
  \ excited for this trip, and spent my hours pondering what it would be like.\nI\
  \ was lost in my thoughts when the plane landed. After I exited the airport, I took\
  \ a taxi to my hotel. I noticed something on the way. It was the beautiful dark\
  \ sky covered with clouds and rain pouring down.  I perceived every drop of the\
  \ rain. Though most people would not have been happy, I found the weather satisfying.\
  \ I reached the hotel and took a rest. After the three-day MUN in Dhaka, I booked\
  \ a train ticket to go to Chittagong because my sister was studying in that city.\
  \ It was unexpected for my sister to see me there out of nowhere. We hugged and\
  \ chatted. The next day, she told me that she had planned a trip to Cox\u2019s Bazaar,\
  \ known as the longest sea beach in the world. Having only seen them in pictures\
  \ and movies before, I had always wanted to visit a beach in real life, so a trip\
  \ to the beach seemed exquisite to me. Now you know how desperately I was waiting\
  \ for this journey to begin.\nOh my god!! I was there speechless, right in front\
  \ of that wild and free beach. I felt envious of the people that lived there and\
  \ commenced their days with the roaring of the sea. It was a universe full of secrets\
  \ and I wanted to drown happily in that deepness with no regrets. I could feel the\
  \ cooling wind touching my face and rolling over my hair. My eyes could not take\
  \ their gaze from the sea and my feet could not stop their steps from moving. There\
  \ were bunches of people taking photos and enjoying the scene, but I was amazed\
  \ that the sea could look this pretty. Every wave drove me nuts; I could no longer\
  \ focus on anything but the sea itself. It was the first time I felt something from\
  \ the core of my heart. It was enormous and beyond imagination. Words are not enough\
  \ to sum up that beauty. As I am typing, one cannot estimate how empty and hollow\
  \ I feel, like something is missing at the moment. I want to go back there.  The\
  \ sea washes away one\u2019s dejection. Every song in my play list reminds me of\
  \ those days. My heart is still there. It enlivened me. \nDon\u2019t believe me?\
  \ I dare you to visit Cox\u2019s Bazaar. You will not regret your decision."
