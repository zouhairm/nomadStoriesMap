Text: "HAMMAM\n\n\u201CTake all your clothes off! Everything!l. A stout woman stands\
  \ before me; her skin is a golden brown, her stance of hands on hips, eyes firmly\
  \ locked to mine,as if daring me to disobey,commands me to follow her.  Even though\
  \ I am modest and don\u2019t particularly like disrobing in front of a complete\
  \ stranger, but out of fear of any retribulations that surely will occur, I am compelled\
  \ to oblige.\n\n\u201CI am Fatima,\u201D she shouts back at me as we paddle down\
  \ a narrow hallway.  The aroma of something medicinal fills my nostrils.  I can\
  \ almost taste eucalyptus.  The steam is thick, beads of condensation roll slowly\
  \ down the walls forming puddles here and there.  I work my way along behind her\
  \ with hands grasping any stronghold I can find.\n\nWe enter another room that is\
  \ dense with hot vapor. \u201C Sit! \u201CAnother command.  By this time my eyes\
  \ are watering and I am alert, watching and waiting for what is to come next.  Fatima\
  \ is leaning over a large ceramic basin with a wooden pail in her hands.  She is\
  \ scooping out water and now turning in my direction, her timeless face tinged with\
  \ menace.\nWithout warning, the entire pail of water hits my body with a deafening\
  \ splash.  I\u2019m reeling!  It\u2019s hot.  I am holding onto my seat so as not\
  \ to slip off, still utterly shocked by her bold action.\n\nAgain, she fills the\
  \ pail and again turns to me with yet another blast. Each time, her strong muscular\
  \ arms reach into the water, I now know what to expect.  I am at her mercy.\n\n\
  I\u2019m numb, yet I am starting to feel a tingling from head to toe telling me\
  \ I\u2019m more alive at this moment than ever before.  After many more buckets\
  \ of hot water, each subsequent pail is cooler, then I am told to lay on a long\
  \ vinyl covered bed.  Fatima slathers a thick gooey soap over my entire body, just\
  \ like the green unshapely globs I saw today at one of the souks in the Medina,\
  \ and with a highly textured loofah, she starts to scrub at my now relaxed body.\n\
  \nI have just survived a real Moroccan Hummam.  I wonder what else is in store for\
  \ me now that I am in Africa."
