Text: "Growing up in south-east Asia, I was frequently questioned about my ancestry\
  \ due to my Portuguese last name. As a Portuguese Eurasian who is born and bred\
  \ in Singapore, I have always wanted to travel to Portugal since I was a teenager.\
  \ I wanted to learn more about my heritage beyond the concrete jungles of Singapore\
  \ and I finally had the chance to visit Lisbon last year. \n\nThe best way to immerse\
  \ yourself in the culture of a foreign land is to travel solo. You can explore the\
  \ destination at your own pace and you would be forced out of your own comfort zone\
  \ to interact with the locals since you are alone. Though I was excited about this\
  \ trip, I knew it would be a daunting experience since I was a lone female traveller\
  \ travelling to Europe for the first time. What made me even more nervous was reading\
  \ horror stories about pickpockets all over tourist destinations in Europe including\
  \ the infamous Tram 28 in Lisbon. When I arrived in Lisbon airport, my friendly\
  \ Portuguese driver who sensed my discomfort asked me if it was my first time visiting\
  \ the country. I nodded and his reply was \"Don't worry, you'll be safe,\" as he\
  \ carried my luggage all the way from the arrival hall to the parking lot. I was\
  \ taken aback by his kind gesture as most drivers would only help me to load my\
  \ luggage in the trunk and they would usually expect a tip in return for rendering\
  \ any extra help. \n\nThroughout my vacation, I have witnessed many random acts\
  \ of kindness from the Portuguese who were always helpful towards the tourists.\
  \ If you are lost, you could always ask the friendly local police for help. There\
  \ were a few instances when I dined at traditional restaurants with no English menu\
  \ available but there would always be a friendly staff who would make an effort\
  \ to explain it to me despite their limited command of English. \n\nI was on the\
  \ quest for more information about my ancestry for my family tree project, and I\
  \ did not expect to find a safe home away from home in Portugal. A lot of people\
  \ would discourage women from travelling solo because of safety issues, and I used\
  \ to agree with them. Now I would tell any female traveller that you only live once,\
  \ and you have to travel solo in order to experience a foreign culture in its purest\
  \ form."
