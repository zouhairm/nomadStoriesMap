Text: "I slowly open my eyes from what felt like a deep slumber. Where the hell am\
  \ I? I see my boyfriend sleeping next to me. He appears to be breathing. Thank God.\
  \ I slowly sit up and my head is pounding. Where am I??...\nI\u2019m slowly falling\
  \ over. I can feel my body drifting as I attempt to stay alert. I\u2019m plastered\
  \ out of my mind and it\u2019s only 3 o\u2019clock. He is sitting in front of me\
  \ telling me to sit up straight before we get kicked out of the restaurant. I know\
  \ I\u2019m in New York, I know I came to an \u201Cendless mimosas\u201D brunch.\
  \ I also know that I\u2019m going to throw up. I\u2019m not sure why I decided to\
  \ drink so much, especially on an empty stomach.\n\u201CIs she okay?\u201D The waitress\
  \ utters.\n I can barely make out her face. The room is spinning and I feel as if\
  \ I\u2019m hovering over my body from above.\n\u201CShe\u2019s fine, can we get\
  \ some water?\u201D my boyfriend utters.\n The waitress returns and slams down the\
  \ glass. The sounds of people laughing, cutting their Eggs Benedict, and the smell\
  \ of pancakes disperses around the room.\n\nAs I sit up and start to look around\
  \ me, I hear an array of noises coming from the couple next to me. They\u2019re\
  \ arguing about paint colors and how the woman wants to become a vegan, while she\u2019\
  s making a sandwich. I wake my boyfriend to make sure he\u2019s alright. As he wakes\
  \ he slowly sits up and I can see his body spinning.\n\u201CWhere are we?\u201D\
  \ he asks.\n \u201CI think we\u2019re in CentralPark\u201D I say, pointing to an\
  \ obvious sign in front of us.\n \u201CHow did we get here?\u201D he asks.\n \u201C\
  Well, we were drinking endless mimosas at the Restaurant, we must have walked\n\
  over here and fallen asleep\u201D.\n He looks like he\u2019s trying to process the\
  \ information I just gave him.\n\n Everyone seems to be having such a good time.\
  \ They\u2019re all laughing and enjoying\nthemselves, meanwhile he is trying to\
  \ make sure I don\u2019t fall asleep. My mind is cloudy, yet racing all over the\
  \ place. I find the strength and eventually get up to go to the bathroom. As I stand,\
  \ the blood rushes to my head and I feel like i\u2019m going to fall but I quickly\
  \ grab the wall to keep my balance. I knock on the bathroom door to make sure nobody\
  \ is inside. I walk in and lock the door behind me. Wow, I look atrocious. My hair\
  \ looks like I just rolled out of bed, my breath smell and tastes like rubbing alcohol,\
  \ and to make matters worse, my dress is tucked into my bra. Perfect. As I look\
  \ into the mirror I can no longer focus on anything except for the fact that I feel\
  \ like i\u2019m going to\nvomit. I feel the sensation of the alcohol rising up and\
  \ down my esophagus. The bile taste in my mouth is terribly unsettling. My head\
  \ is pounding and my heart feels like its going to fall out of my chest. I feel\
  \ dizzy, hot, and oddly excited. I leave the bathroom with an unexpected spring\
  \ in my step. I have a smile on my face, that just won\u2019t leave.\n\u201CAre\
  \ you okay? Should we go?\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m really dizzy, yet excited. We should\
  \ leave before we get kicked out\u201D. We get the bill and my body is in overdrive\
  \ as I stand up. I can sense people looking at me as we leave the restaurant.\n\n\
  \ As I stand to stretch, he has already fallen back asleep. I\nlook around my surrounding\
  \ and see the sun setting. People are packing up their picnic baskets, throwing\
  \ away trash and staring into the sky.\n\u201CWake up! We need to get out of here,\
  \ we\u2019re sleeping in Central Park!\u201D I yell.\n He gets up and looks around.\
  \ He has a dumbfounded confused look on his face. We look at each other and laugh.\n\
  \ \u201CDid we just get drunk off mimosas, belligerently walk over to Central Park,\
  \ and fall asleep without realizing any of it? he asks.\n I turn to him, putting\
  \ on my sunglasses, and say \u201CThat we did\u201D."
