Text: "This is my experience while I was attending a seminar in Bhutan, one of the\
  \ countries at the foot of the Himalayas. It was my third visit to the country,\
  \ which is known with its GNH (Gross National Happiness) concept. \nWe were given\
  \ a chance to experience the lunch with local people at a village in Punakha. We\
  \ had lunch at a villager\u2019s house, who opens a home-stay. The staple food of\
  \ the Bhutanese is rice, especially red rice. The other dishes are usually vegetables\
  \ cooked with cheese. Most of the Bhutanese are vegetarians, but it does not mean\
  \ that there are no meats in their menu. Poultry, beef, and pork are imported from\
  \ India, because the Bhutanese do not slaughter animals, probably due their religion.\
  \ Almost 99% of Bhutanese are Buddhists.\nThe organizer knows that one of the program\u2019\
  s participants, which is I, is a Moslem. So the foods being served were all vegetarian\
  \ dishes. Even the oil used is vegetable oil. The Bhutanese love cheese. Almost\
  \ all of their dishes have cheese as one of the ingredients. A typical Bhutan foos\
  \ is emadatshe, which is a condiment made of jalape\xF1o pepper cooked with yak\
  \ cheese. Its hot and savory taste is suitable for Indonesian taste. \nBhutanese\
  \ dishes are commonly hot, although not as hot as Indonesian sambals. They are spicy\
  \ enough for those not used to hot and spicy food. Much of the other foods are fried.\
  \ Some are very similar to Indonesian snacks, which are shredded vegetables fried\
  \ in batter and friend bananas. The lunch is ended with dessert, which is rather\
  \ sour yellow apricots the size of mangosteens. That was my fascinating lunch experience\
  \ at the house of a villager in Bhutan."
