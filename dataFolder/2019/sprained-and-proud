Text: "Manly Beach, Australia, December 2015.\n\nHow beautiful those photos of girls\
  \ with surfboard, skinny, strong, sporty.\nI wanted to be like that in Australia\
  \ too. But I have a belly, I'm not sporty, and I'm not strong. \"I do not care,\
  \ I'm here, I eat white rice for lunch and dinner to be here, and now I have to\
  \ surf,\" I tell myself.\nOn a cloudy morning I go to the beach at the surf school,\
  \ and I make unsuccessful attempts to make myself understood.\n\"Hi! I need a table!\
  \ \"I try.\n\"What? Why? \"The instructor looks at me, lost. It is evident that\
  \ \"surfboard\" does not say \"table\", as I would like to translate from Italian.\n\
  \"I would like to surf!\" I try again. The guy laughs: \"Ah! So you need a board?\
  \ \"\n\"Yeah, sure!\" We laugh, and I pay an hour's lesson.\nMy first real surf\
  \ lesson! They give me a huge longboard for beginners. Positive side: it is stable,\
  \ made to not let you fall; negative side: weighs a quintal, and a 99-pound creature\
  \ like me does not hold it. \"Determination, determination\", I repeat myself.\n\
  Wonderful, the ocean. Honestly I expected different: I had understood that it was\
  \ huge, but not so much. Seen up close is also a little scary. A little too big,\
  \ those waves. More than it seemed in the movies. I enter into the water exclaiming\
  \ \"Do we really have to?  This board it\u2019s a bit too heavy..\" I give myself\
  \ courage. The instructor directs me and since I am really determined, I masterfully\
  \ take the first wave on the first attempt.\n\"Aha, I'm a professional surfer! Bring\
  \ it on, ocean!\" I scream from the shore. The instructor is very impressed.\nI\
  \ go back and I also take the second wave: \"Even better! Tomorrow world championships!\
  \ Aha! Look at me grandma! I could even do backflips!\"\nI go back. I challenge\
  \ the waves to go further and further. They do not scare me, I'm so strong! It comes\
  \ a wave, a little too big. I do not have time to go back to the shore. I have to\
  \ \"jump it\". I try, nothing, it's too big. I leave the board, pull my foot, I\
  \ end up underwater, I drink. But I do not give up! I get up, but another wave,\
  \ too big, too early, lifts the board, which gives me a big bang in the face, then\
  \ in the shoulder. He crosses me and pulls me to the shore by the foot. I drink,\
  \ I die.\nOnce on shore, I get up pretending not to be dead, and I lift my arms\
  \ strongly to show the instructor that despite everything I'm alive.\n\"I'm ok!\"\
  \ I scream. And that's where I hear a trac.\nOutcome: sprained shoulder, very proud\
  \ instructor, world championships maybe next year."
