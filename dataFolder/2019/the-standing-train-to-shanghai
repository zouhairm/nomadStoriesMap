Text: "Typhoons throw you off course. They upchuck the landscape. They make things\
  \ new.\n\nFor me, an unexpected typhoon meant every train I\u2019d booked along\
  \ the east coast of China was cancelled, and my single-entry visa from Hong Kong\
  \ meant an overnight stay on the floor of Shenzhen\u2019s colossal train station,\
  \ amidst a clamour of uprooted families attempting to get home. A standing ticket\
  \ on a 16-hour train to Shanghai a day later was my last hope of salvaging my trip,\
  \ so I took it, uneasy at the prospect of the precarious journey ahead. \n\nSeated\
  \ passengers eyed me warily as I tried to create a makeshift bed in the aisle of\
  \ the train. Tucked between my rucksack and stranger\u2019s shoes, I dejectedly\
  \ stood up each time the food cart trundled down the corridor. On the way to the\
  \ bathroom, I stumbled upon a group of men wedged together in the smoking area who\
  \ were laughing, playing cards and sharing food together in a den of tightly packed\
  \ suitcases. They must have noticed me watching them, as one man reached out with\
  \ a packet of nuts and asked, \u2018Would you like to join?\u2019\n\nThey told me\
  \ they were commuters, who bought return standing tickets on this train every week\
  \ to work in Shanghai. Over their numerous years of commuting together they had\
  \ lots of stories to tell, and their friendships had cemented to become immovable\
  \ and solid; an unlikely home from home. I flinched as the train shuddered through\
  \ vast landscapes of felled trees and bulging pools of water that danced furiously\
  \ as the wind picked up and lightning ripped through the air, but my companions\
  \ were unfazed. Between unscheduled jerky stops and rainwater pouring through gaps\
  \ in the windows, they joked about their employers and the formidable government;\
  \ but their eyes softened as they mentioned the families they were working so hard\
  \ for. The man who\u2019d originally asked me to join, Li Jun, opened Facebook on\
  \ his phone to show me an article. I was shocked \u2013 Facebook hadn\u2019t worked\
  \ for me as soon as I crossed the border, and he laughed at my surprise. \n\u2018\
  Quiet revolution\u2019, he murmured, and winked as he handed me the phone and we\
  \ read together. \n\nAs night closed in and the ground became an unbroken, inverted\
  \ sea of stars, the group leaned against one another in the cramped enclosure to\
  \ get some rest. Observing me scratching away in a notebook, Li Jun told me of someone\
  \ he knew who became a writer after his rebellious paintings were discovered by\
  \ the government and he was thrown into prison for many years. When he was finally\
  \ released and came home to find his paintings destroyed by his captors, he couldn\u2019\
  t bear to pick up a paintbrush again, but began writing instead, as urgent as ever\
  \ to create art that spoke out against controlling policies. His work was censored\
  \ and living in China became so dangerous for him that he fled the country.\n\u2018\
  Deafening revolution.\u2019, I offered, and he nodded, sadly. \n\nWhen our journey\
  \ eventually ended, we emerged into the towering heart of the silver metropolis\
  \ that is Shanghai city centre, our bones aching and grateful at the sight. As they\
  \ left for their respective workplaces, I realised I had no idea where to go next,\
  \ as the typhoon had entirely rerouted my plans. My new friends spoke with nostalgic\
  \ wonder about a trip they had taken together to the Liu San Jie Light Show in Yangshuo.\
  \ Li Jun explained:\n\n\u2018The play is held on the Li River at sunset with over\
  \ 600 local performers that includes farmers, fishermen, children and even their\
  \ animals. They perform in costumes that blaze with light, floating on boats that\
  \ glide down the river. You will love it.\u2019\n\nI decided Yangshuo would be my\
  \ next stop, and thanked them for their kindness. As we parted ways on the station\
  \ platform, we exchanged contact details and they urged me to promise I would contact\
  \ them if I ever needed help during my stay in China. Touched, I realised I had\
  \ been welcomed into a rare community.\n\nOne untimely typhoon threw me off course.\
  \ It upchucked the landscape.\n\nIt rerouted me, and miraculously, re-rooted me."
