Text: "Two years ago, me and my boyfriend decided to ditch our rainy and cold Russian\
  \ summer and go on an adventure. We\u2019re both not experienced hikers, but I would\
  \ say we are both moderately adventurous. We decided that we needed sun, sea and\
  \ mountains. Commonly, Russians go to Georgia to find all three of those, topped\
  \ off with ridiculously cheap and delicious food, homemade wine and breathtaking\
  \ landscapes. So, the destination was decided, bus as someone who only has four\
  \ weeks off work to discover this cozy planet we call Earth, I decided to fly there\
  \ through Armenia. Just to put another checkmark on my travel list.\nI knew absolutely\
  \ nothing about this country when we landed, and the trip started with trouble.\
  \ The line at the passport control was horrendous. No air conditioning, no windows,\
  \ terrible heat. I always heard that people born in the Caucasian mountains were\
  \ called \u201Cflammable\u201D, but now I got to witness it with my own eyes. Irritation\
  \ ignited into fury in a matter of seconds. A line, which would have been gloomy\
  \ but silent in my country, turned into a microscopic revolt: adults swearing, kids\
  \ screaming. And right then and there I got to the realization: we are strangers\
  \ in a totally different culture. And this is flammable indeed. \nWe got to stay\
  \ in a small town called Gyumri town that reeked of Soviet heritage. The old dusty\
  \ cars, the flaking paint on the houses - everything was giving childhood flashbacks.\
  \  We rented a room in a local woman\u2019s house and she greeted us with such hospitality,\
  \ we couldn\u2019t even hope for. We went to bed with Mr. Stalin smirking at us\
  \ from the wall. \nThe next day we woke up and made Turkish style-coffee for breakfast,\
  \ and we got to experience another tradition in the Caucasus: long conversations\
  \ around the table. Right there, in a beautiful garden we found out that this small\
  \ village used to be a lively, booming city that was destroyed by the Spitak earthquake\
  \ in 1988. Over 7000 people were lost, including our host\u2019s husband and kids.\
  \ I was shaken to the core when she showed us the pictures. After what happened,\
  \ this town has never recovered, not economically, not culturally.\nBut what was\
  \ the most surprising, their spirit was not gone. The next day was the harvest festival\
  \ and we expected nothing from it. The heat was unbearable and as we walked through\
  \ town, dizzy and sweaty, we saw a gang of local boys running towards us, pointing\
  \ fingers and laughing, holding something. Buckets of water! They ran to us and\
  \ before we knew it, we were covered in water head to toe, laughing at each other\u2019\
  s puzzled faces. Turns out, for harvest Armenians pour water on each other for good\
  \ luck. What a lucky day it was!\nThe next three days were filled with adventure:\
  \ we took long rides throughout the country to find all the spots marked for us\
  \ by our host. The cars were old and they all ran on hand-made systems of liquefied\
  \ petroleum gas, as gasoline is too expensive. We rode those dangerous things through\
  \ the endless yellow deserts in the ruthless sun to discover ancient monasteries,\
  \ abandoned churches and beautiful ancient cities. Otherwise loud Armenians became\
  \ silent next to those places. The respect for the culture was palpable. The nature\
  \ was wild, but beautiful: a crystal-clear lake Aragats in the mountains will always\
  \ stay in my memory. I felt the need to stay longer.\nWhen we got to the capital,\
  \ Yerevan, we only had few hours and we decided to visit the Genocide Museum. As\
  \ a big town girl, I am spoiled with culture: installations are nothing new to me.\
  \ This museum only had pictures. Pictures of most terrifying crimes against humanity\
  \ that should have never happened. I was left speechless. The museum has a memorial:\
  \ a huge installation of a gas burner. We stood there in silence, and realized:\
  \ this country is truly flammable. Their flame of kindness, their hospitality and\
  \ love for life is burning against all odds. That country has a spirit of freedom\
  \ that you have no choice, but to respect. A fire in the desert. Flammable Armenia."
