Text: "I bordered a cruise ship in Rome with my parents in November last year. I thought\
  \ it was going to be another old age home at sea.  It was boring up until one chic\
  \ evening when when a charming sommelier in the dining room winked at me. I was\
  \ flattered, but knew that a crew member flirting with a passenger is illegal. In\
  \ my mind I refer to it as customer satisfaction, but I guess he could loose his\
  \ job if he tried anything. \n\nThe first time he came up to my table he offered\
  \ my mother and I some red wine. I was not interested at first, but then throughout\
  \ the cruise I was lured into his million dollar smile and charming Latino accent.\
  \ I eventually played the game and gave him my digits. We texted throughout the\
  \ ship and managed to make a plan to go off shore together. We had the time of our\
  \ lives touring, it was like were having a \u201Cforbidden\u201D summer romance.\
  \ We secretly kept this between ourselves. That night our glances across the dining\
  \ room were priceless. We had such a strong connection, it was hard to fake it...\n\
  \nThroughout the cruise we continued to grow the fire between us by meeting up all\
  \ the time without getting caught on the ship and off the ship. The day I had to\
  \ depart he told me loved me and I thought he was mad because it was only 2 weeks.\
  \ As I departed from the ship he got into a taxi and drove to the hotel to come\
  \ and see me the night before I had to fly home. I was flabbergasted when he told\
  \ me he was at my hotel, of course being the sommelier he brought some wine from\
  \ the shop and to be more cheesy, the same wine he served me the first time he met\
  \ me. He is a crazy love sick Colombian and we did have a magical evening after\
  \ all. \n\nWhen he left he asked me to be his girlfriend, I was speechless. How\
  \ on earth would we ever work out? He pulled out a Swarovski box and gave me black\
  \ swan necklace and told me he loved me again. As a ballerina I was overwhelmed\
  \ with so many emotions and thought it was truly a thoughtful and loving gift. I\
  \ gave him a chance not knowing what this extended summer romance would turn out\
  \ to be.\n\nWhen I got home we FaceTimed and chatted eveyday. He told me when he\
  \ finishes his contract he is going to fly over and see me. This was extreme and\
  \ did not expect him to come from Colombia all the way to South Africa. I broke\
  \ up with him it was escalating too quickly and it seemed mad. Yet he still came\
  \ and surprised me in South Africa. I took him around my home country and was basically\
  \ the tour guide, sommelier, uber driver and girlfriend for 3 weeks. We had the\
  \ most magical time and made golden memories. When he left he told me loved me again\
  \ and gave me another Swavorski box, which was the matching black swan earrings\
  \ to the necklace he bought...He said will do anything and everything to be with\
  \ me, that he is never going to give up. He is planning to visit me at the end of\
  \ the year again...Lord knows what box he going to give me next...All I can say\
  \ is that he is a crazy love sick Colombian and when you really want something I\
  \ truly do believe you\u2019ll fight for it. \n\nIt was a lot more than just a local\
  \ connection, it was chemistry. And it all started off with a simple glance across\
  \ a dining room table. The eyes are the window to the soul. Life is all about relationships\
  \ and connections. Make the most of all of them. You only have one life so meet\
  \ as many people as you can and enjoy every moment with them."
