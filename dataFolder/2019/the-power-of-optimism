Text: "When my sister said she wanted to travel with me to Vietnam a month before\
  \ her wedding, our entire family asked us why we wanted to go out of the country\
  \ so close to the wedding. It took some convincing but we managed to book a 5 day\
  \ trip to Vietnam. \nI usually enjoy researching about a new place before visiting\
  \ it, but I was swamped with  exams and could not read about Vietnam's dark history,\
  \ its war and its hopeful resurrection before going there. On my second day in Vietnam,\
  \ we visited the Cu Chi tunnels where I crawled inside a tunnel that people used\
  \ to hide in during the war. Immediately after that, we visited the War Remnants\
  \ Museum in Ho Chi MInh City and entered an exhibit room that had images and audio\
  \ recordings of people who suffered from illnesses and injuries from the war and\
  \ who were victims of the hazards of Agent Orange, the deadly chemical that the\
  \ Americans unleashed on the Vietnamese. Towards the end of the exhibit was a letter\
  \ that was written by a teenager who was a descendant of one of the victims of Agent\
  \ Orange; and as a consequence of the far-reaching effects of the chemical, was\
  \ born with abnormalities. The letter was addressed to Barack Obama, the then President\
  \ of the United States of America. The boy asked him if, when he spoke about equality\
  \ and ensuring equal opportunities for all, did he also remember the thousands of\
  \ Vietnamese people who were victims of the cruelties that the Americans subjected\
  \ them to. As I read the letter, I could feel a combination of feelings: of anguish,\
  \ a sense of despair over the horrendous past yet a tinge of hope, for a brighter,\
  \ happier future. The young boy did not even for a word, convey any anger or scorn\
  \ in his letter; rather, a heartfelt plea to work together and ensure world peace.\
  \ I broke down after reading the letter and it took some time for the goosebumps\
  \ on my body to go away. \nOn my last day in Vietnam, my sister and I decided to\
  \ go for a walking tour in Hanoi as we believe that walking through a town or city\
  \ is the best way to truly capture its essence. We usually go for experienced walk\
  \ experts but this time, we spotted a kiosk  which was providing free walking tours.\
  \ Students who want to get into the tourism industry in Vietnam offer free walking\
  \ tours to foreigners so that they get to improve their English speaking skills.\
  \ We signed up for the walk with low expectations because we'd already seen most\
  \ of the popular places in Hanoi. When we started the walk, our guide, who was a\
  \ girl as old as me, left the big lanes and led us to streets with spice markets,\
  \ medicinal herb markets, showed us a small house where Ho Chi Minh lived for some\
  \ years and showed us everything that Google might not have been able to show us.\
  \ On the way, she asked my sister about our culture and Indian wedding rituals.\
  \ We also met 2 Israeli girls who had finished school and were travelling around\
  \ Asia for 6 months. My sister and I always claimed to be 'explorers' and 'offbeat\
  \ travellers' but this level of local interaction was something we had never had\
  \ before. We asked our guide about the war and its effects and she did not shy away\
  \ from speaking about it. In her voice, I sensed the same optimism that the letter\
  \ in the museum had; that touched my heart. I'd always been told that \"Tough times\
  \ make tough people\" but after travelling to Vietnam, I strongly believe that a\
  \ small amount of optimism goes a long way. It helped Vietnam develop itself after\
  \ so many struggles; it reminded me of everything we can do, everything we can be,\
  \ every world problem we can solve with a mixture of optimism and hope. That's something\
  \ no book could have taught me. Travelling, though, did ingrain that in me. And\
  \ I will never forget how powerful optimism can be."
