Text: "The trip was a suddenly planned one, post my last exam on a random telephone\
  \ conversation with a friend I asked what this kind of no money travel meant. \u201C\
  Hitch Hiking\u201D came the reply. Even though at instance I didn\u2019t believe\
  \ that a thing like free trip could ever happen in a country like India. But as\
  \ they say \u201CMiracles happen in the land of god\u201D. Starting from an unexpected\
  \ free rickshaw ride till the highway to my return journey in an AC car. The experience\
  \ was truly magical and phenomenal. If I wouldn\u2019t have experienced it, I would\
  \ have never believed in an experience of this kind. After reaching the highway,\
  \ I made my first \u201CI need a lift till Nashik\u201D poster. A kind man offered\
  \ to pay for my bus ride till Nashik, and the rest half of the journey was a gift\
  \ from the kind bus staff. Getting down, it was a new city, new roads but kind people.\
  \ I headed towards a temple where I could get some food and sleep , post my nap\
  \ and lunch I \nwent out to explore the city. I saw museums and much more, Later\
  \ on as I was tired and Hungry , I headed towards the market to have some food.\
  \ I had my stomach filled and taste buds satisfied, for how much money you ask?\
  \ Not even a penny, but as the value for the breakfast: \u201C My story of my hitch\
  \ hiking experience so far\u201D. From that man I came across for my food to multiple\
  \ more kind hearted people I met on that sunny day in Indore. That evening I felt\
  \ I had taken in most of the city, in the video footage of my memory box. The same\
  \ evening I met a man who offered me a free car ride till Mumbai, from Indore to\
  \ Mumbai highway, we exchanged many stories and experiences on the road. The last\
  \ trip from the highway to my building was in a truck. And the truck is always the\
  \ best part about hitchhiking. Because whenever we\u2019re on road it\u2019s the\
  \ best moment to make memories . \nTraveling on Indian roads, is covering beautiful\
  \ scenes with each passing miles,\nFrom Kashmir to Indore, people dress differently\
  \ and talk different.\nOne thing renamed the same,\n\nThe spirit of \u201CAtithi\
  \ Devo Bhava\u201D(guest is another form of god)\nThe spirit of \u201CVasudeva Kutumbaka\u201D\
  \ (world is a family\nThe spirit of a carefree traveling where all the beautiful\
  \ views transform into poems of philosophy, culture , human spirit and life.\n\n\
  **There's a detailed version of this too , but that's for only people who wanna\
  \ actually read. This is like a summary."
