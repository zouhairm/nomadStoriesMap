Text: "\u201CLooking for a place here?\u201D asked Happy bhai walking towards me,\
  \ wearing his hemp shoes under the crisp sun of noon.\n\nMalana is a tiny, ancient\
  \ village in the remote high peaks of Himalaya popular for producing world\u2019\
  s best hashish. Naturally, I doubted his motives for such kindness. It had been\
  \ a long trek up here and without any mobile network I did not know my way around\
  \ so I said yes.\n\nWe climbed up to the very top of the village where he found\
  \ me a room with an amazing view of the horizon breaking. I put my bag in my room\
  \ and all this while he waited for me outside.\n\nOnce I came out he asked me \u201C\
  Do you want to buy some cream?\u201D I agreed right away knowing what it meant.\
  \ After all, it had been one of the reasons I had taken this trek here.\n\nWe walked\
  \ to his house which was not very far and before entering inside we walked through\
  \ his small farm of cannabis. I was still cautious while entering his home. We sat\
  \ on the carpet on the floor and he then took out a box full of charas.\n\n\u201C\
  You made all of this?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201CNot all.\u201D He smiled. \u201CIt\
  \ took the whole family including my maa and my sisters to make so much.\u201D\n\
  \n\u201CSo which one do you recommend the best?\u201D I asked him very surprised\
  \ of how making hash was a family task in here.\n\n\u201CAll of these are from the\
  \ same plants. They would all be just as good, but for me, I think the ones my maa\
  \ rubbed are the best. Everything is better when made with maa\u2019s hands.\u201D\
  \ He handed some to me to try as I rolled it in a joint. I shared the joint with\
  \ him and told him that I would be buying three tolas of it. He generously gave\
  \ me exact amount after weighing it on a scale. \n\nHe then put some from his own\
  \ stash in a bong and we shared hits. Among other stories, he told me that some\
  \ traveler had gifted him this bong a few years ago and he liked it so much that\
  \ he still used it.\n\nHe abruptly got up and said that he would return in a few\
  \ minutes, leaving me alone in the room with all his hash. He then came back with\
  \ two cups of the most amazing tea I\u2019ve ever had.\n\n\u201CHappy bhai, roll\
  \ na.\u201D I said.\n\nAt that point he told me that he did not know how to roll,\
  \ he also timidly asked me to use my stash since we had been burning through his\
  \ for a while. I did so. \n\nHe told me constantly that he was a small man in this\
  \ big world.\n\nHe left again for a couple of minutes and came back with a plate\
  \ of pulao just for me. He had put it up on the pot when he went to get tea.\n\n\
  After I finished the meal he insisted that he would take the plate back, to which\
  \ I was initially embarrassed but understood soon enough. I asked him more about\
  \ the agriculture and business of it. He told me that this is the only plant that\
  \ really grows here and the only means of livelihood. It is almost prasad to them\
  \ and they handle it very religiously. The police can\u2019t trouble them in their\
  \ village.\n\nIt was now well past sunset and naturally I was starting to feel hungry\
  \ again. So he walked me to a small dhabba and only after I had eaten, we said our\
  \ goodbyes.\n\nStories of 'drug worlds', ancient civilizations and rumours of arrogance\
  \ of the Malana locals, who refused to let an \u2018outsider\u2019 touch them or\
  \ the walls of their temples  had inspired some strange ideas in my head about what\
  \ such a place could be like. Instead, I found hardworking and kind people who treated\
  \ me with utmost respect and such warmth that any physical contact was not needed.\
  \ Even though I remained an outsider there, I found myself in the kind of place\
  \ I didn\u2019t know I was looking for."
