Text: "Heralded through the eyes of the Western world as a benchmark for societal\
  \ and technological effiency, I had heard nothing but awe and admiration for the\
  \ island bubble where politeness, respectfulness and well-mannered etiquette reign\
  \ supreme. This is all before one scrapes the surface of the hierarchical nature\
  \ of the language.\n\nAscertained within my first few hours, Tokyo runs on precision\
  \ and consideration. Transport delays are non- existant, workmen bow in respect\
  \ as you cross their worksites and waiters and waitresses treat customers as if\
  \ serving you is the highlight of their year. However, beneath the polished exterior,\
  \ Japan is not exempt from a unique set of societal hardships. \nThese darker sides\
  \ are presented under a rigid mask of clockwork faultlessness. \n\nThis is the Japan\
  \ that nobody told me about. \n\nJapanese work culture is the most glaringly obvious,\
  \ particularly if one travels on the rush-hour Tokyo subway. It is astounding to\
  \ step into a carriage and witness faces smushed into handrails, briefcases and\
  \ designer handbags or similarly static in mid-air, eyes closed and mouths shut\
  \ in a trance-like state. This mass silent sleep is accompanied only by the smooth\
  \ voice of the operator and equally soothing sounds of the train. \n\nAs fascinating\
  \ a spectacle as this appears, it is darkly fuelled by a gruelling work life, exacerbated\
  \ by an obligation to remain at work until your last colleague has finished and\
  \ to drink with your clients after office hours. Half an hour spent giggling at\
  \ a 24/7 casino machine surrounded by men in suits, puffing away on cigarettes (indoors\
  \ is legal), sometimes with a hand down their trousers glued to the screens infront\
  \ of them, left me with a sombre notion of vying for escapism.\n\nTokyo streets\
  \ flooded by hoards of clone-like officegoers during the morning commute are replaced\
  \ by intoxicated versions at sundown. Ironically, a system of early inebriation\
  \ allows for enough sleep to repeat this schedule on loop. This was relayed to me\
  \ in slightly slurred, broken English by a group of young Japanese men outside Tokyo\u2019\
  s British pub over a cigarette, before they convivially announced it was time for\
  \ them to move onto a brothel. \n\nAn obsession with sex is an inescapable part\
  \ of modern Japanese society, unexpected for a culture portrayed in the West as\
  \ undoubtedly demure. Percieving children walking past shops blatently displaying\
  \ sex toys and adult movies throughout the bustling streets of Tokyo, produced an\
  \ inexplainable feeling of intrigue and abhorrence. \n\nMy touristic perception\
  \ of a maid caf\xE9 can only be described only as a warped public space for sugar\
  \ daddies. Aged men, alone, paying good money for 20-something waitresses dressed\
  \ as shorter-hemmed Edwardian maids to present them with snacks in a childlike manner\
  \ of cuteness. This involves repeating \u2018kawaii\u2019 aloud, food shaped into\
  \ animal forms and iconic drawing of air hearts. More money could be exchanged for\
  \ nonexplicit photos. Although my Japanese friend expressed the maids are not considered\
  \ sexy, there was something rather uneasy in witnessing an older man paying for\
  \ the attention of a younger women dressed in fishnets and doilies. \n\nReverting\
  \ back to my Tokyo subway commute, I was introduced to the female- only carriage,\
  \ its times of use boldly plastered in place of advertisement. Sexual harassment\
  \ is still largely stigmatised and Japan was noticeably cautious in its #MeToo uptake.\
  \ Bombarded by advertisement of celebrity idol groups plastered on the walls subway\
  \ stations, the blurred lines of harassment and infatuated idolisation became apparent.\
  \ \nDuring one midday bus journey, I distinctly remember passing an impeccably neat\
  \ queue that lasted around five minutes transit for an idol concert. These groups\
  \ of all-singing, all-dancing teenage girls often dressed in school uniforms command\
  \ a staggering amount of influence, appealling to a wide demographic. \n\nOn another\
  \ subway commute, my Japanese friend responded to my observation that it is not\
  \ uncommon to see men deliberately standing with both arms raised above their heads\
  \ should the carriage be exceptionally busy. As a result of innocent men accused\
  \ of sexual harrassment, this allows for witnesses to confirm that their hands were\
  \ far from reaching distance of the female bodies around them. \n\nIn these perceptions\
  \ and more, Japan fascinates me for reasons I wholly did not expect to find."
