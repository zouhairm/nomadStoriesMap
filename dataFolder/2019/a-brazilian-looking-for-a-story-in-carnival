Text: "Carnival is an important event for Brazilians. Whether we like it or not, there\
  \ are at least five days when the country turns its attention to parades of samba\
  \ schools, clusters in \u2018street blocks\u2019 and everything in the combo music,\
  \ color and fun.\nThe images of crowds celebrating in the streets of S\xE3o Paulo,\
  \ the beaches of Rio de Janeiro or the festivals of Salvador never appealed to me.\
  \ However, there is a not always verbalized pressure about the need to live the\
  \ youth and enjoy Carnival \u2013 there is even a certain judgment if you choose\
  \ to stay at home. So this year, the holiday served as an excuse for a trip to the\
  \ inner city of Guararema.\nGuararema is a charm. As soon as I arrived, I was enchanted\
  \ by the natural abundance on the banks of the Para\xEDba do Sul River and the colorful\
  \ organized houses around the city. I had three days to enjoy that refuge that existed\
  \ within a hundred miles from me and I had neglected.\nHowever, we must not forget\
  \ that it was Carnival. Many tourists had had the same idea as me. Busy streets,\
  \ cars everywhere and sights filled with people eager for the perfect photos to\
  \ post on the social network. None of this was a problem for me.\nThe first stop\
  \ in town was the lodging place. Fleeing from the high values of hotels and rooms\
  \ crowded at inns, I found Maria\u2019s* house on an accommodation rental site.\
  \ I was greeted with a warm hug and pleasant conversations. At such times, I\u2019\
  m sure that no resort is worth a good soul meeting.\nI was gifted with the momentary\
  \ friendship of a woman who had left the coast of S\xE3o Paulo in the 1960s to discover\
  \ herself in Europe and, after five years of adventures, returned to make an administrative\
  \ career in Brazil. A businesswoman who knew the time to learn, the time to act\
  \ and, more importantly, the time to stop. Alone, Maria chose Guararema for her\
  \ well-deserved rest.\nFor me, rest would be worth during the night; while the sun\
  \ was in the sky, the idea was to explore the city. A map provided a ready plan.\
  \ However, on that first Saturday in March, the rain wanted to spread without warning.\
  \ But no showerhead holds an excited traveler. At every pause of the rain, a hurried\
  \ walk led to the desired places.\nIlha Grande Park: closed. The second unforeseen\
  \ incident had struck. Again, no stress. After all, the idea of a trip is to make\
  \ the most of everything that that locality can offer.\nLate afternoon, weak drizzle\
  \ and people began to appear. Boys with skirts, girls with glitter; the most varied\
  \ costumes and colors were passing me towards the loud and distant sound in the\
  \ square where the traditional Arueira Music Block concentrated to start the party.\n\
  A couple screamed behind me. I stopped. They were not dressed or having fun in the\
  \ puddles. He grabbed her. She pushed him away. I gathered all the courage of my\
  \ body and stared at them as they came closer. The man threatened me and I shouted\
  \ that I would call the police. Come on, where\u2019s the police? They were already\
  \ away when I saw a car. First Carnival with a law that makes acts of sexual harassment\
  \ a crime and I could not help the woman.\nNearby, the Arueira Music Block dragged\
  \ at least 500 people through the central streets of Guararema. I watched every\
  \ woman dancing in the crowd. Happy and safe. A relief.\nI followed the plans of\
  \ the trip on other days; I took a ride by train, I walked through parks and I felt\
  \ the good vibration that the happiness of the Carnival revelers leaves in the air.\
  \ With little money, I appreciated the beauty of the city and invested in good local\
  \ cuisine.\nGuararema has a place in my heart for having been my first Carnival\
  \ out of home. A reminder that what makes the trip are the good stories.\n\n* Hostname\
  \ has been changed to preserve your privacy"
