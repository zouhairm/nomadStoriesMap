Text: "This place carries a charge. \nThe moment I look across four lanes of traffic\
  \ separating the port exit and the square opposite already filling up with tourists\
  \ looking for their groups and guides I feel its surge. Breathing in deeply, I take\
  \ a right, deciding to hug the harbor and follow it\u2019s impressive fortified\
  \ walls. I have no group, no guide, very little Spanish. I feel glorious. It's mid-January,\
  \ a strong sun hovers above a dry 80 degrees. I have less than five hours to see\
  \ a city I've romanticized ever since Obama told us we could. \nI follow the broad\
  \ Malec\xF3n, smelling the sea-breeze as it volleys between the harbor and the sea\
  \ wall until it ends and brings me to the Plaza de la Revoluci\xF3n, a desolate,\
  \ concrete expanse where Castro chain smoked cigars and spoke for hours next to\
  \ a mid-century monument to Man.\nI have spent the last three days cooped up with\
  \ my mother and brother, in a room too small for all of our angst and egos. I stop\
  \ for coffee at an iron table in yet another square trimmed with pastel buildings\
  \ full of wooden etchings, crumbling plaster and rickety iron balconies. I have\
  \ one strong coffee with sugar, then another, and mull over my individuality, my\
  \ apparent inability to talk to anyone anymore without exasperation and annoyance.\
  \ I had hoped that I was just overworked and under-stimulated, I had placed great\
  \ hopes on this trip, a chance to bond with a family I seemed to like and understand\
  \ only in fits. It hasn\u2019t worked. I feel a loner after all, all I need are\
  \ some headphones and a new set of streets.\nThree men a table away from me kept\
  \ badgering the fourth about something, I understand none of the words, only the\
  \ quick cadence of the sentences directed at him, and his defeatist sighs in answer.\n\
  Then, \u201Cclaro o negro?\u201D\nThe words pierce my introspection, I jerk my head\
  \ in their direction. These words I know. By the way the man\u2019s three companions\
  \ pause, grin and visibly relax I know I'm right, he is referencing beer. I\u2019\
  m a dedicated drinker, I could not leave Havana without quenching the thirst I just\
  \ now realized I had. I fold a few bills under my empty coffee cup, stub out my\
  \ cigarette and wait. I'm incapable of summoning courage or words to ask them where\
  \ this Cuban beer might be found, so I become James Bond, waiting for my target\
  \ to move. Roughly twenty minutes pass before the men get up and I hope, start toward\
  \ a bar. I nonchalantly follow them. Their gate is easy, their conversation light\
  \ now, they\u2019re in no hurry. The setting sun frames the start to their night.\
  \ I adopt the same rhythm, and them as my unwitting guides. I pocket my headphones,\
  \ and as they chatter on ahead of me I begin to look at the growing number of women\
  \ looking down from second and third floor balconies flanked by lines of hanging\
  \ laundry. Kids and music are ubiquitous now, the former play some scaled down,\
  \ street version of baseball, the later wafts from every door. I notice we have\
  \ left the larger squares behind, the streets have narrowed and the cafes and tables\
  \ disappeared. We couldn\u2019t have walked for more than 30 minutes but there isn't\
  \ a retro taxi in sight.\nI almost walked right by them. My guides had stopped at\
  \ a window of a venta libre. I heard them ask for Caciques, poured light and crip\
  \ into their glasses. I walk up after them and quietly ask for a Bucanero, the dark\
  \ brew I like, the negro. The men sit down on a wide stone bench while a small pack\
  \ of dogs trot by on some business or other. I spot a low stone wall, take my bottle\
  \ and nest myself atop it. I have no idea where I am, or if I can GoogleMap myself\
  \ back, but the sun is low and hazy, the music rhythmic, my beer delicious. I feel\
  \ the peace that has alluded me, I toast my guides and close my eyes on the mess\
  \ of living, with joy."
