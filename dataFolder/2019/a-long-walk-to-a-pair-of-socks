Text: "In a former war bunker in Pristina, this newly converted cinema overflowed\
  \ with students attending a 'short film' Q&A.  The turnout was unexpected as the\
  \ films were screened the evening before.  It was now 9am and I, along with the\
  \ other filmmakers, were endeared to discover so many of the local Albanian community\
  \ turn up for what would be a discussion on war, accountability, and the power of\
  \ storytelling. It was not the last time I'd be surprised that day.\n\n\"Will you\
  \ walk with us, Mr. Alex?\" A trio of siblings who had been active in the Q&A corralled\
  \ me into a long walk around their slow-recovering city.  Leonit, the eldest, a\
  \ budding actor with an Errol Flynn mustache was the leader, followed by his younger\
  \ brother Dee, and his soulful sister Ulpiana.  She didn't say much but when she\
  \ spoke it was purposeful and with meaning.  \n\nThe eternally gray social district,\
  \ still riddled with bullet holes, now laid claim to a cautious, yet slow-bustling\
  \ community.  Small cobblestone alleyways might be confused with any quaint European\
  \ city, were it not for the occasional Muslim calls to prayer amplified from a distant\
  \ Mosque.  We arrived at the uncomfortably-named intersection of George Bush Blvd\
  \ and Bill Clinton Road, before I realized why they had singled me out for this\
  \ gracious tour.  \n\nAbove us, loomed a large statue of Bill Clinton with grotesquely\
  \ misshapen hands. \"A local made it! We love Americans!!\"  This was not my anticipated\
  \ welcome by a city with a travel advisory warning.  What I came to understand,\
  \ was that this predominantly Muslim community had a deep affection for those former\
  \ presidents, and the policies that ended the decade-long conflict.  The feeling\
  \ was so prevalent, that the local night markets included American flags and the\
  \ popular-selling Bush bobblehead among other tchotchkes.  It was 2013, and the\
  \ irony of a viewpoint not dressed in xenophobia warmed me.\n\nSuddenly, a homeless\
  \ man passed who was deep into conversation with the sky.  Coming from New York,\
  \ it didn't really phase me, but I noticed the trio gently tap their heart twice,\
  \ before turning to me.  \"You're lucky to see him, Alex\"  I was confused, as Ulpiana\
  \ walked towards me. \"We call him Jesus of Pristina.  Before the war he was one\
  \ of the richest men in the city.  He lost his children and his wife, and this is\
  \ now his life.  If he comes into contact with you, it is a local belief that good\
  \ things are to come.  Circle of life, yes?\"  I didn't know how to reply but I\
  \ really didn't have to.\n\n\"You must meet our mother!\" No time to contemplate\
  \ before the trio shoved me into the unmarked taxi. We whisked though the streets,\
  \ slowly elevating away from the cramped center, into the quiet of the local hillside\
  \ community.  We arrived at a lane with seven modest two-story homes.  As we walked\
  \ toward their house, a few of the neighbors, all women, smiled and waved at us.\
  \  It was friendly, but also curious.  Ulpiana spoke before I could ask.  \"None\
  \ of these homes have fathers anymore.  People pay attention but you are safe.\"\
  \ She smiled warmly as we entered her home.  After taking off our shoes, and listening\
  \ to them recount to their mother the days events in Albanian, the mother gently\
  \ grabbed me by the wrists and sat me down for a local meal.  She spoke no English\
  \ but food is universal!  Small salads and an Albanian centerpiece called 'Fli',\
  \ a multilayered pancake-like dish, served with sour cream, was quickly brought\
  \ and rapidly devoured.  I felt like I was being tested as I ate, but it was delightful\
  \ and hearty.\n\nMuch of the remaining evening was a blur as they poured some Skenderbreu,\
  \ the local brandy.  As the laughter turned into nightfall and we said our goodbyes,\
  \ Ulpiana handed me a puffy pair of socks.  \"We walked a lot today.  May you feet\
  \ stay warm on your long journey home.\"  It was not a Harry Potter reference, but\
  \ a deep new friendship.\n\n(Re: Country of the story.  I chose Albania, since Kosovo\
  \ is still disputed.)"
