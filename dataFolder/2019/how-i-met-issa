Text: "We first kissed at my housewarming party. The place was the best I could afford\
  \ on three hundred dollars a month as an intern in Sri Lanka. The shower produced\
  \ only a treacle of cold water, but who needs hot water on a tropical island anyways?\
  \ At least there was no rat in the kitchen \u2014 my main requirement for the new\
  \ accommodation. \n\nWe were standing at the balcony, while inside the apartment\
  \ three dozen people were getting hammered on cheap arrack and playing \u201CB*tches-b*tches\u201D\
  . To play this game one has to choose a name for himself. And by name I mean a sexual\
  \ position or a place where you\u2019d do it. The players sit in a circle and clap\
  \ their hands to a certain beat. When your name is called, you repeat it twice,\
  \ then call out someone else\u2019s name, all while maintaining the beat. You mess\
  \ up \u2014 you drink. \n\nWe escaped to the balcony to talk. I remember asking\
  \ him, \u201CHave you been working out?\u201D while accidentally on purpose touching\
  \ his arm (gosh, kill me!). He leaned to kiss me. I closed my eyes and clearly heard\
  \ our friends clap inside the room and cheer \u201CSixty nine!\u201D, \u201COn the\
  \ floor!\u201D, and \u201CMissionary!\u201D. That\u2019s how I thought I met Issa.\n\
  \nRewind. I\u2019d spent only two weeks in Sri Lanka, when New Year\u2019s eve crept\
  \ in. The interns were throwing a party on the beach, and I couldn\u2019t be happier\
  \ to escape hot and humid Colombo, if only for a day. We started drinking in the\
  \ morning \u2014 twenty-year-olds who finally broke free from parents tend to have\
  \ special appreciation of alcohol. At midnight, we ran into the ocean screaming\
  \ and hugging one another.\n \nFor the life of me I cannot remember meeting Issa\
  \ at that party. Neither does he remember meeting me. But the picture of us two\
  \ smiling into the camera says otherwise. On the first day of the new year I posted\
  \ it on Facebook. The intention was to say \u201CLook! Me and my Sri Lankan friend!\
  \ I am doing well here!\u201D My friends didn\u2019t need to know I had no idea\
  \ who the guy was. A month after the kiss on the balcony I came across this picture\
  \ again and gasped: \u201CIs that my boyfriend?\u201D That\u2019s how I really met\
  \ Issa. \n\nRewind. I arrived to Sri Lanka on a Friday evening in December of 2010\
  \ and almost burst out crying upon seeing the interns\u2019 house. My new roommate,\
  \ Dana from Kazakhstan, happily announced that we have no hot water, a rat lives\
  \ in the kitchen, and my three-hundred-dollar salary won\u2019t let me die of hunger.\
  \ On Saturday morning she dragged me on a trip to Nuwara Eliya with ten other strangers.\
  \ Not craving to stay one-on-one with the rat, I obliged.\n \nThe guy who planned\
  \ the trip had to stay behind last minute; he did book us accommodation, though.\
  \ After five long hours on the winding road we arrived to Nuwara Eliya only to find\
  \ no hotel. We called the manager and asked for directions. \n\n\u201CDrive by the\
  \ lake and turn right after two hundred meters\u201D, said the manager. \n\u201C\
  Ok\u2026\u201D We were dreaming of soft beds and hot shower. Hotels, unlike regular\
  \ houses, usually have hot water.\n\u201CNow go all the way down the lane. Do you\
  \ see the hotel?\u201D the manager asked.\n\u201CNo! There\u2019s nothing here!\u201D\
  \ We were in the middle of nowhere, feeling desperate. \n\u201CLet\u2019s start\
  \ over. Drive by Kandy City Lake\u2026\u201D \n\u201CWait, what? The hotel is not\
  \ in Nuwara Eliya?\u201D \n\u201CNo, it\u2019s in Kandy\u2026\u201D\n\nKandy, or\
  \ as locals call it, Nuwara, was a three-hour-drive away. The Sri Lankan guy who\
  \ booked our accommodation confused the names. A collective gasp escaped everyone\u2019\
  s lips, \u201CIssaaaaaa!\u201D That\u2019s how I could have met Issa. That\u2019\
  s how I heard my future husband\u2019s name for the first time."
