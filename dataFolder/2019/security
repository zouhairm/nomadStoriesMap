Text: "\u201CHow is Tolstoy today, Pavel?\u201D \n\nHis greying moustache bristled\
  \ over a quirked smile, and his eyes crinkled as he looked up from his paperback.\
  \ \n\n\u201CNot bad. He didn\u2019t have a good mood this chapter, many characters\
  \ are now dead.\u201D \n\nOr at least, this is what I thought he replied. My Russian\
  \ was still at that terrible and awkward level, when most discussions I had were,\
  \ at best, linguistically stunted. \n\nPavel was one of the first faces I had seen\
  \ at Moscow State University, a hulking, Stalinist monstrosity which looked outward\
  \ over the city from it\u2019s perch on Sparrow Hills. My plane had landed in the\
  \ bluish early morning, after the biggest snowfall the city had seen in over a hundred\
  \ years. Two days later, as the storm pushed further on it\u2019s journey westward\
  \ from Siberia, British newspapers would print in frantic, bold letters about \u201C\
  The Beast from the East!\u201D  \n\nBut, as I\u2019d disembarked at Domodedovo airport,\
  \ the snow question was piled around the tarmac in walls taller than myself, and\
  \ a crawling army of workers were routinely scraping it away. On my way to The University,\
  \ where the roads or paths weren\u2019t yet cleared, I had to plough my way through\
  \ the fresh, deep drifts. Irrational fear knotted within my stomach, that if I fell\
  \ I would be buried alive. \n\nPavel, with his colleague Dima, was a security guard\
  \ at the entrance to the dormitories. They worked and slept in alternating shifts.\
  \ The entrance had a security gate, which was electronically connected to nothing\
  \ and simply stood precariously in front of the door, as well as a chair for the\
  \ guard on duty. The adjoining room had a sagging camp bed that nearly touched the\
  \ floor. Heavy grates on the floor collected the melted snow from the shoes of hundreds\
  \ of students in black, slushy puddles. \n\n Some days Pavel didn\u2019t much feel\
  \ like talking, and as I flashed my student card he would simply raise and lower\
  \ his eyes with a short nod, allowing me through. He always had a book though, an\
  \ endless rotation of classic Russian literature. Some days he would tell me about\
  \ it \u2013 the mood, the colour, the images that it reminded him of places he had\
  \ seen in his lifetime. At first Pavel was reluctant to talk to me, which wasn\u2019\
  t surprising considering I was a foreigner stumbling through his language; a language\
  \ he cherished in the pages of his books. When I spoke, I was constantly falling,\
  \ and getting up and falling again, bashing around the sounds and phrases. It must\
  \ have sounded careless to him. \n\nWhenever he told me about his favourite companions\
  \ (Pushkin or Tolstoy), his arms began waving with enthusiasm. Fed from his energy,\
  \ Dima would start yelling too, slapping Pavel on the back waving his arms around,\
  \ the Russian between them pouring thick and fast and exhilarating, entangled and\
  \ complex I was helpless to do anything but stand and listen to the web of language\
  \ they were weaving around me. \nAs the daylight began to linger, the splat splat\
  \ splat of melting icicles hung on the air like music. Tiny buds began smattered\
  \ the trees in a soft green haze. True warmth kissed everybody on their exposed\
  \ skin, and my body almost sighed out of my heavy winter coat as the mercury tentatively\
  \ nudged 0. \n\nI passed through that small entrance with it\u2019s whirring heater\
  \ at least twice a day. Lethargy and boredom hung humid and sticky in the air, embedded\
  \ within the foundation of the peeling, crumbling walls.  Sometimes from my dormitory\
  \ window, I would see Dima moving restlessly outside the gate, his face turned upwards\
  \ towards the low sky, like a plant seeking sunlight, his breath hazy and cloaked\
  \ around him."
