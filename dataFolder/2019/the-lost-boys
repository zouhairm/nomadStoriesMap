Text: "It is said that there are approximately 800,000 LGBTQ refugees in Turkey. Many\
  \ who came from the Middle East. It is a safe haven, for Turkey does not prosecute\
  \ homosexuality. With the current political climate worldwide, resettlement efforts\
  \ have come to a near halt and gay refugees have been left in political and social\
  \ limbo that has turned into several years of uncertainty. This wave of global populism\
  \ has left the most vulnerable people without hope. A stark contrast from the bravery\
  \ it took them to leave their home  countries where homosexuality Is sometimes met\
  \ with death sentences and torture. I met Peyman online through a social networking\
  \ platform, he was 28 years old from Tehran, Iran and living in Ankara, Turkey.\
  \ He told me he lived with 3 other Iranian gay refugees for several years in a one\
  \ bedroom apartment. Unable to speak the Turkish language, he worked washing cars,\
  \ a job quite different from his usual career as a civil engineer. Peyman encouraged\
  \ me to visit Istanbul while he was there visiting for an annual LGBTQ  celebration.\
  \ With its hilly streets and ancient touches, Istanbul was another rapidly gentrifying\
  \ city. Peyman met me at a local coffee shop, a cafe that has been an unofficial\
  \ gay hang out. There I met several other gay refugees who sipped coffee and chain-smoked\
  \ while discussing their plans for the upcoming celebration. An upbeat group of\
  \ men who seemed excited to express their new sense of freedom, a freedom I had\
  \ taken for granted in the US. Peyman was shy and didn\u2019t speak much since his\
  \ English was limited, but that didn\u2019t stop him from wanting to show me around.\
  \ We visited the Haga Sophia, the 8th wonder of the world and a former Greek Orthodox\
  \ Christian cathedral turned mosque once the Ottoman Empire conquered the area.\
  \ Inside you could see remnants of its Christian past, with darkened cross mark\
  \ shadows on beams where crucifixes once decorated the area. Strolling through its\
  \ gardens and down the cobblestone roads lined with colorful graffiti on walls,\
  \ you will find a park that will take you back to ancient times. A stroll here will\
  \ give you a taste of the past with its rolling hills and long trees that have been\
  \ growing for centuries. Walking through the park you will eventually land at a\
  \ rocky coastline that is the Sea of Marmara, where fishermen fished and the feral\
  \ dogs of Istanbul feasted on the raw meat of one generous caretaker. Peyman said\
  \ it was his favorite part about Istanbul as it reminded him of home In Iran, a\
  \ place he missed, but more his mother. It had been years since he\u2019d last seen\
  \ his family and he wasn\u2019t sure if coming to Istanbul and waiting for a country\
  \ to accept him was ever going to happen; A choice that he still struggles with\
  \ today, for it\u2019s been almost 5 years that he and several others are without\
  \ a permanent country to call home."
