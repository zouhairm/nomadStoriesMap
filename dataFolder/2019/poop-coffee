Text: "The midday sun was burning our shoulders as my girlfriend Barbara and I were\
  \ riding our scooter toward Pura Ulun Danu Batur, an incredible temple at the foot\
  \ of the volcano Batur in northern Bali. Like everything else so far on our trip,\
  \ the temple visit was part of a meticulously planned itinerary.\nIn the middle\
  \ of the countryside, we were searching for that blue or green liquid that locals\
  \ sell in bottles of vodka on the road (I\u2019m not sure if it's possible to call\
  \ it gas) to fill up our bike when a scooter passed us and honked. Shouting louder\
  \ than the noise of our motorcycles, Hary, as we later discovered he was called,\
  \ alerted us that there would be a police blitz some miles ahead. He told us to\
  \ stop at the road side, and we obeyed.\nThe lovable Balinese then asked us if we\
  \ had an international driver's license to ride bikes in Bali. With our negative\
  \ response, Hary warned that in such situations, local police officers often ask\
  \ for bribes from unsuspecting tourists. Since we had read reports about the corruption\
  \ of the Balinese police \u2013 nothing very different from what we find in our\
  \ homeland, Brazil \u2013 Barbara and I were afraid. Paying bribes is not exactly\
  \ an experience that we wanted to have. Also, the bribes weren\u2019t included in\
  \ our expense spreadsheet.\nHary told us then that he worked at a coffee plantation\
  \ nearby and invited us to visit. There, we could wait until the police blitz got\
  \ off the road, which should happen in an hour or two.\nAmidst the fear of having\
  \ to pay a bribe (or worse) to a corrupt cop and having a cup of coffee, we chose\
  \ the second option.\nWe rode our almost-out-of-gas-scooter for another few minutes\
  \ when Hary started slowing down. On a highway sign, there was the draw of a small\
  \ mammal and the words \"Kopi Luwak\". For a moment I felt like Jack Nicholson in\
  \ \"Bucket List\". We were about to have the poop coffee.\nWe parked the motorcycle\
  \ and, still somewhat apprehensive, we entered a small farm. Shortly after the entrance,\
  \ a cage with a civet. This small mammal eats coffee beans and, after defecating,\
  \ its feces are harvested, washed and, thanks to some chemical and biological mechanisms,\
  \ it produces the best and most expensive coffee in the world.\nBarbara and I looked\
  \ at each other. Like any couple who have lived together for years, we don\u2019\
  t even need to speak: our eyes expressed the agony of seeing that little animal\
  \ trapped in the cage. Hary probably caught our agonized exchange of looks and then\
  \ explained: \"this is the only one in a cage, because it\u2019s sick. If it gets\
  \ loose, it can contaminate the others\".\nA little more relieved, we followed.\
  \ Our kind host served us something like 8 varieties of coffee: with coconut, ginger,\
  \ ginseng, local roots... And of course, poop coffee, as my girlfriend and I affectionately\
  \ call Kopi Luwak \u2013 I hope Jack Nicholson doesn\u2019t listen to me.\nAlthough\
  \ I'm not exactly a barista, I can tell: the coffee really is delicious. No wonder,\
  \ I brought a package to Brazil to serve my parents.\nIn addition to the delicious\
  \ coffee, we enjoyed the incredible view of the coffee plantation and the funny\
  \ stories that Hary \u2013 tour guide in his off-hours \u2013 told us about.\nAfter\
  \ our stop, and with some packets of coffee in the backpack, we continue our path\
  \ towards the Pura Ulun Danu Batur. After finally finding a smiling lady who sold\
  \ us the blue liquid inside a bottle of vodka, we rode the scooter for no longer\
  \ than five minutes until we saw the police disarming their blitz and leaving their\
  \ stop.\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly what we expected to see that day. Although we read\
  \ a lot about Bali before the trip, we didnt read anything about coffee plantations,\
  \ but a nice Balinese was enough for the bribe to a corrupt police officer to become\
  \ a delicious poop coffee and even more delicious stories."
