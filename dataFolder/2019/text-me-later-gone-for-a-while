Text: My story started as an Introvert ended an Extrovert Silence. It takes me a moment
  to even identify this phenomenon, so alien is it to my everyday experience. Thanks
  to 15 days lived largely on planes and in airports, shuttling between various metropolises,
  the absence of sound isn't something with which I'm overly familiar.Yet that is
  what surrounds me after I settled in my room facing upon the Tower bridge with serene
  calm and windy chilly night with the lights bestowing the city at night is a site
  unforgettable for a backpacker who has never been out of his country before it.
  As a 1st time traveller out of India and entering a place completely unknown is
  the most exciting scary bewildering challenge; On my 17 days trip to Scotland-London-Ireland-N.Ireland
  starting with London - City of Dreams was the most dreamy start for 1st time solo
  experience. Exploring the city in my one long week stay in the capital city made
  me realise the city is as a small as grain in the sack from a naive tourist point
  of view but from a lost travellers eye its like looking from a telescopic view which
  when i realised is the best way to explore a city is not by being a traveller but
  by being a local so i cancelled my hotel stay and lived with a local family and
  then started to explore the real London yes i did saw the most common touristic
  places ( London Eye, Buckingham Palace, Madame Tussauds, Big Ben ) but that's when
  i realised that's how travellers look at London and not what London is all about  but
  then when with the local family the places i explored the corners i visited the
  boulevards and allies i walked are the places not a single traveller has ever seen
  on a typical London trip. Then my next destination was Scotland, Edinburgh! (Fun
  fact i cancelled all my hotel bookings in 7 cities and booked hostels and Airbnb
  after realising the best way to explore a city and go places is by being a local
  yourself and not a tourist) Started my day at as early as 5 am early in the morning
  walking up the Arthur's Seat to witness the sunrise you cant capture that moment
  by a Camera then walking down hiking down the mountain and having a hot choclate
  float at Mary's Milk Bar facing the Edinburgh Castle in the cold typical January
  Scottish weather is the most pleasing time after a early start finished my day with
  going to Greyfriar's Kirkyard night show and then to Camera Obscura and catching
  a late night bus to Dundee staying with a local family in Dundee and exploring the
  city and its rich history in whale and jute industry going into factories and workshops
  which as tourist is not even possible to get into then flying to Ireland and going
  to Galway, Sligo, County Mayo and of course Dublin hopping into bars having Irish
  drinks living the Irish lifestyle all because of a Irish friend i made while travelling
  to Sligo from County Mayo before him i went to bars and had drinks that did not
  feel different from my India but later with him in Dublin Galway the bars he took
  me into the drinks i had the places i visited the local language  picked up " what's
  the craic" and few Irish slang helped me to make a strong local connection felt
  like was living in ireland since birth like a citizen and then last stop to Northern
  Ireland and going to all exotic locations 100 miles of Belfast visiting Game of
  thrones location and beaches and pykes and terrains and UNESCO sites was like living
  a dream inside a dream with a unlimited time frame was the highlight of my debut
  backpacking international trip. Before flying i did not even think i would have
  made 5 friends i ended up with having friends from almost 30 countries 7 continents
  100 cities 200 friends and countless memories learning culture of every different
  place and realising the world we know and have seen is not even 0.001% of all. Started
  as an Introvert ended a socialist Extrovert
