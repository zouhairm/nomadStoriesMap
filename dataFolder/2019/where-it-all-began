Text: "Back in 2013 I was an undergraduate student about to finish my degree at University,\
  \ I have had some international experience before and as the end of my career approached\
  \ the moment of truth would come for me to find a job and start what can be expected\
  \ from a graduate student. \nMany of my mates and class mates where working already\
  \ at some places and starting a professional career on graphic design, the career\
  \ I chose, so this day came when I asked; What I was expecting from myself to do\
  \ after finishing my education life? This is a very special moment in life where\
  \ you are free to choose what you want to do and realising what you wanna live like,\
  \ but at the same time we don't know or even realise about this or any other life\
  \ questions or stages where we start designing our own paths. \nSociety and mostly\
  \ parents are expecting this moment to be the end of our education life and the\
  \ start of our adult and professional life, meaning the real world and we never\
  \ know how or why happens but suddenly you find yourself lost on track when you\
  \ can't find your truth on what you want to do for the rest of your life; and that's\
  \ where it  all began...\n\nFew years before on a spring night I was in my room\
  \ and I remember I saw the moon by the window thinking on how my future would be\
  \ and who I wanted to be when this feeling came to me and then suddenly inside my\
  \ head the first thing that came to me was a word, a simple word that marked that\
  \ day and my future days: INDIA.\nWhen I suddenly went back to that feeling and\
  \ that night that something changed and decreed I wanted to live in India for a\
  \ while, I found myself in it and  knew it would be something that would change\
  \ my life forever, so my heart started beating and a strange feeling on how it would\
  \ be to live there would be like I knew I was doing it.\n\nTalking about India in\
  \ M\xE9xico it's a special point of view as Mexicans grow up with the idea of it\
  \ as a mystic, intriguing place full of palaces and elephants, we think of a country\
  \ full of people and yoga around the corner but then I realised just a few people\
  \ would really jump into the unknown and break those barriers in the idea of a certain\
  \ place and that that's something that not only happens between M\xE9xico and India\
  \ but between the world.\nThe idea of changing you eating habits, your local weather\
  \ and even your mother tongue is crazy; How someone would do that?! \n\nNext thing\
  \ I needed to decide is what I was supposed to be doing if I wanted to live there\
  \ and how long would I like to do it, so thinking about India I compared it to things\
  \ that happens in my country and found that in my position as a graduate student\
  \ I was free to do what I wanted and also I had the commitment not only with my\
  \ country  but the world to contribute in something that would change someone life\
  \ so I decided to become a volunteer.\n\nI have heard about volunteering before\
  \ and I didn't realise what is it about until you do it once in your life. Months\
  \ later I found doing this would change my perspective of life and that during my\
  \ year living in India the meaning took a complete different point of view and perspective\
  \ on what would someone think of it as you are doing things to help others with\
  \ no financial income, another crazy idea no one would think of in this practical\
  \ world!\n\nSo this is the beginning of a life time experience I would learn and\
  \ live when living in India, at present time we have so much things to decide and\
  \ change we sometimes don't realise that in order for you to achieve and do things\
  \ you should concentrate, connect and start doing them now, the time is now to leap\
  \ into the unknown."
