Text: "Religion can be a sensitive topic for some- it\u2019s understandable that the\
  \ questioning of one's beliefs can often come off as offensive, even if the intentions\
  \ are purely inquisitive. I wear the Virgin Mary around my neck, a nod to my Catholic\
  \ upbringing, and a Buddhist charm below it, paying homage to the spiritual journey\
  \ of my late teens, though I wouldn't define myself to either. It's hard for me\
  \ to believe that the answers to life's greatest questions are summed up into books\
  \ that reside in hotel room dresser drawers, and ancient scripts proudly displayed\
  \ in museums around the world in an attempt to provide clarity to those who seek\
  \ it, though I understand our need for answers.\n\nI was 18 when I decided to go\
  \ backpacking in Southeast Asia. A passion for animals brought me to Thailand, where\
  \ I ended up at an elephant sanctuary that would satisfy my desire to interact with\
  \ them in the most ethical way possible. The program was education based, titled\
  \ \"A Mahout for a Day\u201D- mahout meaning elephant keeper. We started early,\
  \ right after dawn, with a 2-hour drive into the mountains. When we arrived, we\
  \ were given traditional Mahout garb to wear, then taught the Thai words that the\
  \ animals would respond to. Nine of us sat under a straw hut, staring wide-eyed\
  \ at the gentle giants feasting on a pile of bamboo, as our instructor snapped his\
  \ fingers in an attempt to reign in our attention. Each of us was assigned to one\
  \ based off of our energies, which were assessed by the eldest mahout. I was matched\
  \ with a mother and her baby, Cyclo and Bubba. \n\nWe were shown how to check their\
  \ health and how to brush the mud off their backs with palms. Bathing them in a\
  \ nearby waterfall was a surreal experience, and they playfully sprayed us with\
  \ the murky water when they were ready to get out. Afterward, we road on their bare\
  \ backs through a river to their grazing area, where they ate grass and we ate a\
  \ traditional Thai lunch of fried chicken, sticky rice and bananas, picnic style.\
  \ The day was coming to an end, and we were soon back at the pickup spot to be transported\
  \ back into town. \n\nSaying goodbye to my new friends, I pressed my forehead into\
  \ Cyclo's trunk, sending her all the gratitude I could for such an incredible day.\
  \ Bubba wrapped her little trunk around my arm in what I thought was her version\
  \ of a parting embrace. I didn't realize she thought my arm was a piece of bamboo,\
  \ and she had just started teething. The next thing I know, my fingers were being\
  \ crushed between her molars. \n\nPain and panic quickly changed the mood as I was\
  \ rushed to the hospital. The ride was pure agony for me, and though I felt like\
  \ an adult at 18, all I wanted in that moment was my mother. A woman from Mexico,\
  \ who was traveling with her family, held me close to her chest, rocking me back\
  \ in forth in an effort to comfort me, praying out loud to God and Jesus. In an\
  \ effort to distract me, she started asking about my own beliefs, speaking openly\
  \ about her own. Before I knew it, she was recruiting me to Christianity, and I\
  \ prayed to God between sobs, begging to have my pain taken away. \n\nThankfully,\
  \ I recovered from the experience, and I reflect on that day often. In my desperation,\
  \ I'd sought relief, and I was willing to do anything to receive it. I didn\u2019\
  t expect myself to believe in God after childhood, but for a moment, I did, and\
  \ I'm able to approach conversations on religion more open-mindedly because of that.\
  \ Religions have converted entire nations with fear, and though my experience could\
  \ never compare, it brought me a deeper understanding of humanity. It created more\
  \ space for compassion in my own heart, and as the Dalai Lama once wrote, \u201C\
  It is my fundamental conviction that compassion\u2014the natural capacity of the\
  \ human heart to feel concern for and connection with another being\u2014constitutes\
  \ a basic aspect of our nature shared by all human beings\u2026\u201D"
