Text: "August 2018 was a rough time. I almost lost myself due to a relationship I\
  \ was drowning in with a narcissistic man child. I needed to get away and be alone\
  \ for a bit and everytime I board a plane I metaphorically feel my problems being\
  \ left on the ground as I climb into the sky, onward to a new place to get lost\
  \ and found for a bit. I booked a spontaneous flight to Switzerland and decided\
  \ to spend December and January, all holidays included, abroad with just my backpack.\
  \ I made a bucket list of items I was going to go after, fearlessly, and set the\
  \ intention to connect with the new faces I would encounter. What I really wanted\
  \ was to learn how to trust again. As I Aribnb hopped, I had the privilege of staying\
  \ with a welcoming hippie couple in Z\xFCrich who gave me hope that real love exists.\
  \ Their story is lovely; Chelsea is from LA, where Alec, from Switzerland, had stopped\
  \ through. She was working in a bar, left him her phone number and a week later,\
  \ along with several phone calls, Alec booked a flight back to meet her in person.\
  \ After 3 months of phone calls and video chatting, Chelsea and Alec eloped and\
  \ she moved to live with him in Z\xFCrich. You could just feel the love radiating\
  \ between the two of them as they danced around the kitchen, making dinner together.\
  \ They invited me to eat with them during my last few nights where they got to hear\
  \ 'my story' and by the end of my third Aperoli Spritz, they had me convinced to\
  \ not be afraid to take a leap of faith despite the obstacles. Just before my flight\
  \ home, I booked a last  minute paragliding experience to overcome my biggest fear\
  \ - my fear of heights. My thought process was, 'If I could run off the side of\
  \ a mountain, I could really do anything else I set my mind, and heart, on.' What\
  \ a remarkable, and truly freeing experience! As my feet landed back down on the\
  \ ground in Nashville, a new found strength had emerged. I came back, fearless,\
  \ still, and hopeful. The strangers scattered all over are potential life savers.\
  \ When I think about the couple I stayed with and the leap of faith they took to\
  \ see where the love they had for each other would take them, I felt inspired to\
  \ keep going after things that light me up rather than continue to keep things around\
  \ that weigh me down, including the person from my previous relationship. This new\
  \ wave of gratitude is one I'm choosing to ride for awhile."
