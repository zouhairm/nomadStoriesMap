Text: "Why do individuals choose to follow other people\u2019s path or beliefs? My\
  \ ultimate curiosity about mankind has led me to explore how one social stigma known\
  \ as the bullying phenomenon along with the field of marginalization that it implies\
  \ would possibly affect the former social group I used to be a part of. \nOne closed\
  \ road, rain and some liquor bottles, what could possibly have gone right?! Six\
  \ kids whose sole intention was to put an end to the nerve-racking Friday they were\
  \ having resulted in the clique falling to pieces with considerable side-effects\
  \ such as bits of vivid memories that did not hesitate to go straight to my head\
  \ like some sort of concussion. However, prior to the wreckage, it was just a normal\
  \ after-classes afternoon. A warm spring day when you could frolic in the sun for\
  \ hours and smell in the air a scent of burnt hay bales, which could make you feel\
  \ more alive than a sunflower. We agreed to show up to the usual park quarter, which\
  \ still knows our deepest, darkest thoughts, but without any special plan in the\
  \ back of our minds about how to kill the remaining Friday time efficiently. Courtesy\
  \ of a sense of recklessness, we started roaming the surprisingly quiet, dusty streets\
  \ of an otherwise crammed city and empty fields, in order to discover one abandoned\
  \ shadowy rose meadow located half an hour away, near a covered bridge. \nAs we\
  \ were putting one foot in front of the other, I noticed a strange feeling that\
  \ was gradually diminishing our attempts to maintain a group conversation, in that\
  \ even the most talkative girl, A., the actual person who would try on a daily basis\
  \ to make sure that everybody\u2019s opinion was taken into account, at that point\
  \ she was keeping her thoughts admirably locked in, far-off the one-way path that\
  \ we were absently sharing. \nFast forward ten minutes later, when we were almost\
  \ done with the journey, the sensory input shot up which implicitly led to the silence\
  \ vanishing. The all-around atmosphere had begun to indulge us into an adrenaline-inflicted\
  \ state of mind, hence the huge, sheer immensity drawn out of the fading lighting\
  \ poles\u2019 debris across the dusking sky began to result palpable. We were by\
  \ ourselves in this daunting natural background, two hours before midnight and without\
  \ any proper guidance-related knowledge about how we got there. It takes one distinct\
  \ issue to make it a collective one, by multiplying it in the intent of assembling\
  \ the singular components mirroring, in reality, an extended concern among individuals.\
  \ Basically, if I would have told A. about my escape concern, she would have clarified\
  \ to the rest of the group the complexity of the situation in which we were relatively\
  \ trapped, therefore calling off our not-so-realistic option to unwind. I did tell\
  \ her. She laughed. What took place next was left in the power of the night so as\
  \ to be weighed and given a sentence. \nScreaming as they were hitting the bumpy,\
  \ grass-reflecting hill with their hoodies, too fast for my eyes to predict the\
  \ magnitude of the consequences. However, I remember it as errors are always remembered,\
  \ cloudless, guilt-flavored, with a background sound so silent that it shivers.\
  \ You would not have expected E. and S. to be the first ones that would want to\
  \ exit the bridge\u2019s pillars. In small acts of one-second-heroism-seeking like\
  \ these lies the true nature of what is known as male bond. I still think of them\
  \ as the epitome of a friendship which I have never got tired of admiring, for more\
  \ often than not, they would disconnect from our group to share their opinions on\
  \ something in such a way that it could only be understood by them, the alpha and\
  \ beta, the only boys in an otherwise arrangement of girls.\nIt is in the form of\
  \ an endless kaleidoscope with memories that keeps haunting me through flashbacks\
  \ whenever thinking how that night ended \u2013 with each of us finding our own\
  \ means to return home, and losing track of each other. All the seconds of that\
  \ black starry night come back to me but they never do."
