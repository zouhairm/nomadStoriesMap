Text: "The house was raised on stilts, and there were a few wooden steps leading to\
  \ the entrance. The man we followed there kicked his sandals off on the first step\
  \ and then disappeared under the thick grass roof. We entered behind him, and he\
  \ ushered us over to a corner where a woman was rocking a baby in a hammock. I began\
  \ to introduce myself in Spanish, but she seemed not to see or hear me. The air\
  \ was thick and hot inside. I looked at the man, unsure how to proceed, and in a\
  \ low voice he said something to her in their language. She scoffed and stepped\
  \ aside. The man cracked a small smile at me and said in Spanish, \u201CShe doesn\u2019\
  t like doctors, but our baby is sick. Please, help her.\u201D \n\nI was volunteering\
  \ for an organization that set up medical clinics in the island communities of the\
  \ Ng\xE4be-Bugl\xE9 indigenous people in Western Panama, and the man had come by\
  \ our clinic earlier saying he had a sick baby\u2014too sick to bring to the clinic\u2014\
  so myself and two volunteer doctors gathered some supplies and followed him to his\
  \ home. \n\nAs soon as the baby felt the stethoscope touch her, she started wailing.\
  \ The woman snatched her up, shushing her and turning her back on us as she did.\
  \ I pleaded with the man: \u201CIf she could just hold her and keep her calm while\
  \ they check her vitals\u2026\u201D He spoke to the woman in that strange language,\
  \ this time his voice a little firmer. She said nothing, but she turned toward us,\
  \ allowing the doctors to work. \n\nThe baby had a high fever. I asked how long\
  \ she had been sick, and the man interpreted the question for the woman, who I then\
  \ realized didn\u2019t understand Spanish. Two days. She had also barely drunk any\
  \ milk since the night before. I interpreted for the man what the doctors were saying,\
  \ that the baby needed to go to the hospital immediately, that we would arrange\
  \ a boat to take them to the main island, that they may have to stay for a couple\
  \ days and should prepare whatever they needed. He started to tell the woman, but\
  \ I got the feeling he had already seen how this would play out and knew exactly\
  \ what she would say. She cut him off mid-sentence. He started again, but she silenced\
  \ him with a sharp response, and he turned to me with a defeated look. \u201CPlease\
  \ do what you can, but we won\u2019t take her to the hospital.\u201D\n\nWhen we\
  \ got back to the clinic, we told the supervisor what had happened. The two doctors\
  \ were both upset. One wanted to know if there was an organization we could call,\
  \ like Child Protective Services. The other thought maybe we had done something\
  \ wrong. The supervisor assured us we hadn\u2019t. The Ng\xE4be had a general distrust\
  \ of Western medicine, but especially of the local hospitals, and horror stories\
  \ abounded, like of women being given tubectomies during C-sections without their\
  \ consent. It was only during the last few years that many of the villages had begun\
  \ allowing the clinics, and still there were villagers that shunned our presence.\
  \ \u201CThey have their reasons, and they have their own beliefs about what\u2019\
  s best,\u201D said the supervisor. \u201CWe\u2019re not here to force our way of\
  \ life on them. With time they\u2019ve come to trust us more, and that trust is\
  \ what allows us to do our job. Just know that you all did exactly what you should\
  \ do.\u201D \n\nAs we packed up and prepared to leave that afternoon, the man came\
  \ back to thank us again for our visit. We left him with some Tylenol for the baby\
  \ and told him to let us know if they changed their mind and needed help arranging\
  \ a boat. He smiled and said he would let us know, and I knew there was no chance\
  \ they would, but he seemed happy. On the boat ride back to the base, I had to remind\
  \ myself that we weren\u2019t there to save them: we were there to gain their trust,\
  \ and we had done a good job that day."
