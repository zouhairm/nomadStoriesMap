Text: "It was the summer of 1999. I was 21 years old and backpacking the Silk Road\
  \ in China. If you were to travel the Silk Road today, you\u2019d be able to take\
  \ a westbound train from any major city along China\u2019s eastern coast through\
  \ its northwestern most province. But back in 1999, the train tracks ended in Urumqi:\
  \ the capital of Xinjiang Province, at the edge of the Takalamakan desert. \n\n\
  Being that I was 21, in a foreign country, and feeling adventurous: my travel companion\
  \ and I decided we\u2019d bus the rest of the journey along the northern edge of\
  \ the desert.\n\nWe spent hours on trains and buses during that month-long trip.\
  \ There were comfortable sleeper trains at the beginning, followed by less comfortable\
  \ sleeper buses. Then on the last leg of the journey to Kashgar, the town across\
  \ the border with Afghanistan - we embarked on a 50-hour seated bus ride. \n\nThroughout\
  \ this bus ride, I basically come in and out of consciousness - I was utterly overcome\
  \ with passenger fatigue. Sometime during the second night, some commotion by the\
  \ door woke me. Exhausted and with foggy vision, I see water coming up to the edge\
  \ of the bottom step of the doorway. The bus driver drove across a shallow stream;\
  \ but I don\u2019t know this and I think: we are driving straight into a body of\
  \ water and the bus would be submerged soon!\n\nAs I readied myself for meeting\
  \ my early death, I whispered the words, \u201Cmommy, I want to go home.\u201D\n\
  \nThis past summer I walked the Camino de Santiago, a month-long spiritual pilgrimage\
  \ in France and Spain, where I decided to pass my 40th birthday. One day while walking,\
  \ this memory came up: \n\nAs a kid growing up in Hong Kong, I attended a private\
  \ school where the school day ended in the early evening. One day, when I was about\
  \ 6 years old, school ended an hour early. I must\u2019ve forgotten to tell my mom\
  \ about the early dismissal the night before, because when the school bus driver\
  \ dropped me off at my stop, my mom was nowhere in sight. \n\nIt was getting dark.\
  \ I could see my apartment building across the street, but I was a good kid who\
  \ listened to my mom when she says things like, \u201Cdon\u2019t cross the street\
  \ without holding an adult\u2019s hand.\u201D So I waited. With no bus shelter,\
  \ I stood on the sidewalk holding onto the metal guardrail. With tears fogging my\
  \ my vision, I stared at the apartment building that was my home. Scared, I waited\
  \ for what seemed like the longest hour of my young life. \n\nWhat I remember from\
  \ that evening was wondering whether my mom was mad at me; because probably at some\
  \ point that morning I didn\u2019t do what she asked me to do. I had hoped that\
  \ this was just a punishment, and not abandonment.\n\nThis memory came back so strongly\
  \ while I was on my pilgrimage that I knew while this wasn\u2019t the lesson that\
  \ I thought I wanted to learn as I prepared myself to enter mid-life, this was the\
  \ lesson I needed to learn.\n\nWeeping that day on my pilgrimage in Spain, I also\
  \ remembered this - my mother was never late again for after-school pick up. Not\
  \ even after we moved to the United States, and during the years when she lived\
  \ as an undocumented immigrant. Instead, she continued to pick my siblings and I\
  \ up from our school bus stop until my brother, the youngest of us, started high\
  \ school. That day in Spain, I realized that for my mother - the thought that I\
  \ might have been taken away at 6, or that I might have convinced myself that I\
  \ wasn\u2019t worthy of her love, was more frightening to her than being picked\
  \ up by US immigration authorities.\n\nA few weeks ago, after a visit to my sister\
  \ in New Jersey, my parents dropped me off at the train station so that I could\
  \ get back to Brooklyn. As I was getting out of my parents\u2019 car my mom turned\
  \ to me to ask, \u201Cdo you want us to wait with you until you got on the train?\u201D"
