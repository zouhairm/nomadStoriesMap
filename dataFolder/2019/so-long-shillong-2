Text: "So long...Shillong\n      \n     \n\n                                     \
  \                                               It all began with a phone call from\
  \ my best friend after we gave our pg entrance exam, we were planning to relax and\
  \ a friend of hers had once mentioned it to her that you could have a vacation anywhere\
  \ but this is where you'll get an experience of a lifetime and so we were off to\
  \ discover the ever so intriguing northeast of India particularly Shillong . I had\
  \ my own reservations about this trip; after a year of listening to harrowing lectures,\
  \ cramming for hours and hours for my test; it was safe to say that the travel enthusiast\
  \ in me had gone dormant. And it didn't help that those areas were frequently in\
  \ the news for the Maoist- Naxalite insurgency or that it was slightly cut off from\
  \ the Indian mainland. But I was happily surprised.\n\n               From dangerous\
  \ roads to dead phones; from narrowly escaping an accident to fainting friends and\
  \ raging bulls running after you;  and to get lost in an unknown city with Google\
  \ maps betraying you; it had all the necessary ingredients for what one could call\
  \ a truly epic travel story. Yet these were not what made this jaunt what it was.\
  \ \n\n            We had rented bikes for our journey there. Initially, I was reluctant\
  \ about the bikes. I was worried we would be run over or much worse drive off a\
  \ cliff. The road wasn't promising either with sharp turns and blind curves. It\
  \ was a tiring journey with chilling winds and the long commute but the drive was\
  \ worth it. The changing landscapes, lush greenery, the sun warming you up and the\
  \ fog floating away from you, it literally feels like your riding the clouds. And\
  \ when the journey starts to wear you down you can always stop by the tiny bamboo\
  \ houses littered along the pathway that welcome you into their homes and offer\
  \ you warm food so that you can get back up and reach your destination.\n\n    \
  \          Nature was generous when bestowing its gifts to this land. I didn't expect\
  \ to find such crystal clear lakes anywhere let alone here. And you'll find plenty\
  \ of them almost at every other mile. The water was so transparent that you could\
  \ see the school of fish swimming at the bottom. \n\n                It was their\
  \ way of life that entranced me the most. I like the contrast they offered to the\
  \ rest of the country. It was refreshing to see women lead the families, make livelihoods\
  \ in an essentially male-dominated country with one of the highest rates of female\
  \ foeticides and infanticides. They offered me a glimpse of a society that was truly\
  \ gender equal. The northeast is primarily inhabited by tribes who preferred being\
  \ in their eco-friendly huts despite having the means to otherwise. It was pleasing\
  \ to see people go out of their way to help you and make you feel welcome when they\
  \ are not shown the same courtesy in the rest of their own country; making them\
  \ feel like an outsider by calling them Chinese, Nepalese and what not.\n      \
  \       \n                  The northeast is not just home to living root bridges\
  \ or the cleanest village in Asia or the various see-through cascades; it is also\
  \ home to the people that genuinely make me believe that India actually is a country\
  \ that celebrates unity in diversity. And thanks to the seven sister states my wanderlust\
  \ had come out of its slumber."
