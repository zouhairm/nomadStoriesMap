Text: "Breathing in a night sky bigger than any I had ever beheld, I turned off my\
  \ headlamp. The creamy moon lit our path up, up, up. The borrowed boots were bulky\
  \ on my feet; my snow pants made a swish each time I took a step. The stars were\
  \ innumerable and I paused often to gaze at them but Marco pushed us on. Natalia\
  \ hiked a few feet in front of me. On the steep incline her edges blurred into the\
  \ darkness that surrounded us. It was so cold. The air carried shivers inside me\
  \ with every inhale.\n\nI hadn\u2019t done everything I could in order to prepare\
  \ for this moment. I hadn\u2019t run 4 miles to the fence and back, wasn\u2019t\
  \ able to hike Pasochoa without taking a break, hadn\u2019t acclimated enough so\
  \ that altitude migraines weren\u2019t a daily occurrence. But the moment arrived\
  \ anyway, completely unaffected by my lack of preparation. Cotopaxi loomed in front\
  \ of me- perfect, inviting, and haunting. \n\n\u201CDescansamos\u201D said Marco,\
  \ our guide for summiting Cotopaxi. \"Let\u2019s rest.\" I pulled out my water bottle\
  \ and held it to my lips. No water came. \n\u201CEst\xE1 congelado!\u201D Marco\
  \ laughed. \"It\u2019s frozen.\" I whacked it on the ground a few times to break\
  \ up the ice, then popped a few pieces into my mouth. The moon had turned an eerie\
  \ yellow, it hovered above us, huge and inescapable. We snacked on nuts while strapping\
  \ on our crampons. Marco demonstrated how to walk in them and how to use the ice\
  \ pick.\n\u201CLet\u2019s go,\u201D said Natalia, my best friend since we met as\
  \ college freshmen.  \u201CI\u2019m too cold to keep sitting.\u201D\n\"Vamos.\"\n\
  \nWhen the moon disappeared we turned our headlamps back on. We had left the rocky\
  \ part of the trail and now only ice crunched under our big boots. The ice picks\
  \ whistled as they bit down. The path was narrow. My body ached. We were all attached\
  \ by a rope, Marco tugged at me from in front, Natalia from behind. I fell into\
  \ a rhythm.\n\nLeft foot right foot ice pick. \n\nCrunch crunch pick.\n\nCrunch\
  \ crunch pick. \n\nBreathe. Feel cold air enter my lungs. \n\nRepeat.\n\nLook at\
  \ the stars. At the mountain. Look at Natalia. I was absolutely positive she would\
  \ get to the top, even if I couldn\u2019t. \n\nCrunch crunch pick...\n\nMy heart\
  \ hammered. My breath was shallow. I was growing weaker. The trail, miraculously,\
  \ got steeper. The summit was nowhere in sight. \n\u201CMira!\u201D Marco called.\
  \ Natalia and I turned. Far off on the horizon was a broad, faint amber glow. Marco\
  \ answered the question on our faces.\n\u201CEs Quito!\u201D\nThe capital city of\
  \ Ecuador shimmered quietly in the distance. Suddenly, a loud crack followed by\
  \ a deep boom pulled us from our reverie, avalanches invisible in the night reminded\
  \ us of the mountain\u2019s indifference.\n\nWe trudged on, snow and ice up to our\
  \ knees. I ignored every signal my body was sending me to stop; the pain in my chest,\
  \ the budding headache, the fire in my legs. I stumbled and fell. I didn\u2019t\
  \ want to get up. Later I fell again, and again. The horrifying thought crossed\
  \ my mind that maybe I wouldn\u2019t make it. \n\nSuddenly Natalia was screaming\
  \ and Marco was hooting. I lifted my eyes, there was one more hill standing between\
  \ us and Cotopaxi\u2019s summit. Giant ice crystals jutted out every which way like\
  \ frozen swords, blocking us from our destination. With renewed energy, Natalia\
  \ and I scrambled one last desperate scramble, and pulled ourselves over the final\
  \ ledge, onto the icy edge overlooking an active volcano. \n\nIt was 5:30 in the\
  \ morning. We had hiked all night. On wobbly legs I hugged Natalia, then high-fived\
  \ Marco, my frozen cheeks pulling into a smile despite my exhaustion. We witnessed\
  \ a pastel sunrise over the valley of volcanoes and a milky sea of clouds. Marco\
  \ pointed out Pasochoa, the small volcano where Natalia and I had worked 6 weeks\
  \ as trail guides. Steam spewed from Cotopaxi\u2019s deep crater. We felt literally\
  \ and figuratively high- 19,346 thousand feet above sea level and giggling in pure\
  \ joy. We were both nowhere we had ever been before, nor ever would be again."
