Text: "At 8 o\u2019clock, there are only a few stragglers in the bar: an older English\
  \ couple, a man drinking alone, and a group of spring break American kids. The band's\
  \ lead singer, a Thai man clad in bare feet and a beaming smile, is lively despite\
  \ the quiet atmosphere. Electricity seems to radiate from his petite frame, and\
  \ his expression is all-knowing.\n\nIt\u2019s a typical island pub with a few tables,\
  \ a narrow aisle, and a small stage upfront. Two walls are composed entirely of\
  \ sliding garage-like doors, the metal accordions folded to expose the colorful\
  \ and crowded streets of Ko Phi Phi. Thunder roars dully in the background, not\
  \ unusual for this time of year in Southern Thailand. Every now and then, the sky\
  \ lights up above the street lamps.\n\nAt 9:30, Reggae bass fills the room, a call\
  \ to the locals. The band pauses to greet them with warm high-fives. Louder customers\
  \ follow, emboldened by booze from other bars. The singer grabs a couple from the\
  \ audience and implores them to dance. \n\n10 o\u2019clock. Song requests are taken.\
  \ We sit up a little straighter. The college kids went up for another round but\
  \ stay standing, careful not to give away too much eagerness. Dancers join the couple\
  \ in the center, encouraged now by clapping hands and impressed laughter. Onlookers\
  \ are bumped into, so they move their table and chairs out of the way. For a moment,\
  \ I am worried they will leave in annoyance, but they quickly return, stomping to\
  \ the drums. \n\nOne by one, inhibitions strip away and we are up from our seats.\
  \ It is not enough to tap our toes, these people from around the world want to dance.\
  \ The act of letting loose is contagious. As the rhythm builds and the remainder\
  \ of the furniture is pushed back, the lead singer seems unsurprised that almost\
  \ everyone is on their feet. Some move in a skillful manner, others sway just a\
  \ little offbeat. It is a holy sight as we shift effortlessly from the YMCA to Bachata.\
  \ If you don\u2019t know it, someone teaches you. \n\nHumid island rain trickles\
  \ in, mixing with sweat and Singha to cover our shoulders. Shoes kick off and toes\
  \ are stepped on. Elbows clash together like cymbals. Phones and purses are abandoned\
  \ on counters. A harmony is achieved with eclectic accents, all of which are belting\
  \ Amy Winehouse. I can hear that the woman next to me does not know the lyrics,\
  \ but continues to chant all the same. A tall blond man says something to me in\
  \ German; I shrug my shoulders dumbly and he grins, spinning me around. \n\nI\u2019\
  m not sure what time it is. The bar is full capacity, so people spill onto the streets.\
  \ Strangers reach up to hold hands with those inside the bar. It\u2019s still raining\
  \ and most are barefoot, rum buckets in tow, hair plastered to faces. A child sits\
  \ on a pair of shoulders, bobbing up and down. Swaying with his eyes shut, an old\
  \ man smokes a cigarette that refuses to stay lit in the downpour. One of the bartenders,\
  \ a large man towering over the crowd, shimmies out and embraces a friend like he\
  \ hasn\u2019t seen him in years. Guns N\u2019 Roses blares over the microphone,\
  \ sung by a stunning Brazilian woman.\n\nThere is a pulse in the room, a choreography\
  \ for one body that morphed from awkward side-stepping to poetry in motion. The\
  \ same reserved people I saw at the beginning of the night peel their bodies off\
  \ the wall and gravitate towards the center of the room. In one of the allegedly\
  \ most commercialized and touristy places in Southeast Asia, I witness a miracle\
  \ happen in its most organic form. The lead singer had known something we hadn\u2019\
  t: music dissolves the barriers of language, age, and origin. It tears down the\
  \ barriers made from fear and borders, and the ones separating local and visitor.\
  \ The singer knows this dive bar is grounds for a ceremony, he\u2019s the humanitarian\
  \ to show us we are part of something universal."
