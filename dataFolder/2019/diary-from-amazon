Text: "It was the last day in the Amazon forest. We has a \"sweet\" awakening in the\
  \ forest. Rog\xE9rio, our guide, prepared coffee for everyone and then we ate some\
  \ bread and disassembled the camping, ready to go back to the lodges. Our mean of\
  \ transport consisted in an old, small and quite unstable wood ship in which water\
  \ was continuing entering because of the holes in the wood and the weight. \nFirst\
  \ stop: the house of a local family. A sailor welcomed us smiley and proud showing\
  \ us a four meters long crocodile he had just killed that early morning (It could\
  \ look like a brutal action, but actually that reptile will be able to feed an intere\
  \ family for about two weeks). Then we visit their home and meet all the family\
  \ members. Back on the boat a big spider appeared in front of Jessica, my arachnophobic\
  \ friend, and she just disperately cried until the arrival to the lodge, while the\
  \ guides and I were making fun of her (bad friend, I know). \nAfter lunch it was\
  \ already the time to go back to Manaus, and I was feeling was quite sad, since\
  \ even if we had stayed there for just 3 days, we made friends with the locals,\
  \ to the point that an old woman wanted to adopt me and offered me a small place\
  \ in her wood house where I could live with her seven sons and twelve grandchildren.\
  \ I gently refused the offer, but I promise I will be back soon. \nWe say goodbye\
  \ to everyone, and start our journey back: we had to catch one boat, one combi,\
  \ another boat and a taxi to reach our hostel in the city. Everything ok with the\
  \ first boat, but then there was no combi waiting for us, no one to contact and\
  \ no internet connection. After one hour of waiting we had already made friends\
  \ with the old owner of the local shop and with a sailor, who told me that, as long\
  \ as I bought my small boat, I would have a house in the Amazon forever, and he\
  \ made me promise to come back soon. \nAfter two hours and half, the combi arrived,\
  \ and I go back to Manaus with just one certainty: I will go back soon, I promised."
