Text: "Here I am, walking through the streets of Brussels in Belgium. It\u2019s a\
  \ charming city. There\u2019s no doubt about that. The smell of waffles is wafting\
  \ from shops, spilling out onto the cobblestone streets. Gothic and baroque architecture\
  \ encompass the Grote Markt. The EU flag is flying outside the town hall as horse-drawn\
  \ carriages meander in and out of the square. An image that feels like an ode to\
  \ modernity and history all at once.\n\nI know a thing or two about Brussels. I\
  \ have the history down to a tee. But I\u2019m no infatuated tourist trying to get\
  \ a feel for the \u2018Belgian\u2019 way of life. No, I am a tour guide. A tour\
  \ guide who is nervous, not least because this is my first time in Brussels and,\
  \ yet, I\u2019m a tour guide for the day here. Here\u2019s hoping they go easy on\
  \ me on my first day. \n\n*\t*\t* \n\n\u201CThis is your \u2018script\u2019, shall\
  \ we say.\u201D says Nadya, handing me a pile of printed paper the day before the\
  \ first trip. \u201CI want you to learn this for tomorrow, Aishling.\u201D\n\nNadya\
  \ is my boss at the tourism company. Our target market are students at the University\
  \ of Groningen in the Netherlands, where I\u2019m on an exchange programme. It turns\
  \ out, the sheets of paper contain history and facts about the city of Brussels.\n\
  \n\u201CNo bother, Nadya.\u201D I reply, concealing how out of my depth I feel.\
  \ \n\n*\t*\t*\n\nEnunciate, Aishling. No \u2018dese, dat an\u2019 dose\u2019. It\u2019\
  s \u2018th-ese, th-at and th-ose\u2019. You\u2019re not in Ireland anymore. For\
  \ the love of God, do not go all \u2018Hiberno-English\u2019 on them, I say to myself.\n\
  \n\u201CNext stop, the Manneken-Pis.\u201D I say as I fumble around with Google\
  \ Maps, hoping no one sees. \u201CFollow me, everyone!\u201D \n\nI nearly would\u2019\
  ve missed the little Belgian legend, myself, had it not been for the bustling group\
  \ of tourists congregating around him. \n\n\u201CThat\u2019s it?\u201D a student\
  \ asks, rather unimpressed by the statue of the peeing child.\n\u201CThat\u2019\
  s him.\u201D I enthuse. \u201CThe man, the myth, the legend.\u201D \n\nHe\u2019\
  s a bit of a catfish, I admit. Definitely not what he looks like on Google images,\
  \ anyways.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the story behind this?\u201D asks another student,\
  \ turning to me.\n\u201CWell, there\u2019s a few tales out there.\u201D I say as\
  \ I begin to find my feet. \u201CSome say this little fella saved the city of Brussels\
  \ from enemies when he peed on gunpowder fumes. Others say he was the son of a wealthy\
  \ merchant who went missing. When he was found, the merchant erected a statue in\
  \ the fashion his son was found in; peeing on the corner of the street.\u201D\n\n\
  By the time everyone has some grub and free time to roam the city, we have to make\
  \ our way back to the Netherlands. On the journey home, I become acutely aware of\
  \ the silence. Not something you\u2019d expect on a bus filled with international\
  \ twenty-somethings. I turn around to have a look. From the back to the front of\
  \ the bus, dozing students are all I can see. I suppose our first trip has been\
  \ a success.\n\nWhen I think back to it, I didn\u2019t expect to find Nadya in my\
  \ apartment block that day. I had seen passed out students in the early hours of\
  \ the morning from the night before. I had seen confused delivery guys trying to\
  \ deliver takeaway food. I had seen students' rendition of the walk of shame. I\
  \ had even seen a pigeon or two. But never had I seen a middle-aged woman wearing\
  \ a hijab in the foyer until that day. She was recruiting international students\
  \ to work for her tourism company. Now that I think of it, she was actually trespassing\
  \ on private property. But I\u2019ll forgive her for that one. \n\nThe morning after\
  \ the trip, I check my phone to find a WatsApp from Nadya.\n\"Next up, Paris.\""
