Text: "Travelling and making friends goes hand in hand. Travel gives experience and\
  \ experience leads to friendship for life. Interestingly, I met one guy in the volvo\
  \ and he was from one of the beautiful villages of Kullu, one of the beautiful states\
  \ of Himachal Pradesh, India settled between Lower and Greater Himalayan Ranges,\
  \ along the banks of Beas River. It is famous for temples and base point for many\
  \ Himalayan treks like Bijli Mahadev, Chanderkhani Pass etcetera. Noticing, I am\
  \ a travel enthusiast and have been to many places, he invited me to visit his village\
  \ where he lives with his wife. After, a little nagging, I agreed and visited with\
  \ my partner.\n\nThe Saur village, residence of our host away from hustle bustle\
  \ of city life, clean water, cleaner air, was at greater height, having built houses\
  \ on one side of mountain and distant Beas river at footsteps of mountains on other\
  \ side, showing panoramic view of valley, the view you usually witness with drone.\
  \ As you move your eyes on mountains full of deodar and pine trees, from right to\
  \ left, you can see point where it seems like mountains from both sides are joining,\
  \ giving protection to the valley; it was spellbound as the sun was setting behind\
  \ them leaving magical sky lights. Absorbing the view, we reached the destination,\
  \ and we were welcomed by him and her wife. Looking at her wife\u2019s eyes; I could\
  \ ascertain she is happy to see me around and so was I. A simple, welcoming and\
  \ content woman. She greeted us with coffee, arranged bonfire outside and made tandoor(oven)\
  \ for heat inside the room. I helped her with the same and discussed general things\
  \ about her way of life. They even have cows for fresh milk and has grown few vegetables\
  \ in their land nearby. It was just wonderful, as you know you are having organic\
  \ things. \nThe day ended with nice dinner, the next day our husbands were working\
  \ on some work plans and my new friend took me to her land treading on the undulated\
  \ pathways sloping up and down having apple trees. She took me to meet her sister\
  \ and her kids. Their house was made of wooden frame and stone walls, with conical\
  \ roofs. We discussed various topics, advised each other on various aspects of life\
  \ and detailed the pros and cons of city and village life. Without any clear conclusion\
  \ on same, we moved back and on way back, we saw 1000 years old tree standing right\
  \ in the center of the village marking the history and its significance for village.\n\
  \nAfter reaching the place, we prepared lunch, had nice discussions and then started\
  \ preparations for dinner. The other beautiful day ended and when we woke up the\
  \ next morning, the nature surprise was waiting for us. The lush green trees were\
  \ white and far off sight was not even visible due to clouds. It was snowing!! It\
  \ slowly turned the slopes into beds of thick snow. It continued for two days, we\
  \ played in snow, made snow balls, walked on the paths and even slipped sometimes,\
  \ laughing it out. Our partners were also enjoying each other\u2019s company, cutting\
  \ woods for fire and chatting. We relaxed afterwards packed in our blankets, enjoying\
  \ the view.\n\n\nThe other day, we followed the treaded paths of gypsy on snowy\
  \ roads and made way back to our place, saying goodbyes to each other but with a\
  \ promise to see each other soon and welcome each other at our respective places.\n\
  \nThe visit construed that sometimes you become more comfortable sharing your thoughts\
  \ with strangers because you know, they are not going to judge you and they may\
  \ provide best thought in you which you never came across due to similar surroundings.\
  \ Moreover, the Nature has all healing capacity and is just beautiful, wherever\
  \ you are. It\u2019s a new learning and it\u2019s a new connection!!"
