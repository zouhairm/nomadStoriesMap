Text: "\u2018Mijo\u2019 a Spanish word meaning \u2018my son\u2019 is something you\
  \ would commonly hear from older Colombians to express their kindness and warmth.\
  \ But in the summer of 2018, I understood its true meaning. \nRosa, my landlady,\
  \ 50 years old, struggle painted on her face but always with a grand smile and her\
  \ \u2018coste\xF1o\u2019 (from the coast) charm, a \u2018fiesta\u2019 on her own.\
  \ I had been renting a room in her house for almost 2 months in Cajica, a small\
  \ Colombian town roughly 25km north of Bogota, while I volunteered to teach English\
  \ in a public school. \nOne morning, she knocked at my door to check up on me. Maybe,\
  \ because it was around 3 pm and she hadn\u2019t seen me all morning. I was on vacations\
  \ and usually talked to her at breakfast for some new story of her son, Javier,\
  \ who at the time was travelling in Ecuador as a street musician. From what I knew,\
  \ he was quite like me, rebellious and a traveller or how she liked to put it, \u2018\
  loco\u2019 meaning crazy. \nI opened the door and saw her concerned look. Dressed\
  \ in a bright pink track suit, I was the black to her white.  Looking at my ruffled\
  \ hair, a sleep deprived face and a sense of sadness; she simply asked \u201CHave\
  \ you eaten anything since morning?\u201D My high tone of voice was missing.  I\
  \ hadn\u2019t left my room in the last 18 hours. Resisting her invitation for lunch\
  \ for a few seconds, I accepted because I was indeed very hungry. My reluctance\
  \ was aimed at avoiding the questions I assumed were coming my way. Instead, she\
  \ told me another one of Javier\u2019s stories, but the theme was different. She\
  \ recounted his troubled childhood, time in the army, bipolar personality, ongoing\
  \ battle with depression and all, that a mother tries to hide from the rest of the\
  \ world about her son. \nHonestly, I was a little surprised because I had always\
  \ heard positive stories about him from a worried but proud mother. She told me\
  \ how, as a child, he used to get her into trouble with the neighbours, how he had\
  \ to quit the army because his medical result proved his bipolarity, how he couldn\u2019\
  t work a job for more than 6 months and his lack of motivation to build a steady\
  \ life for himself. \nAs the stories went on, I realized that she had recognized\
  \ my depression and was trying to share her own experience, through her son. In\
  \ the last several years, I have had such phases, lasting from a few weeks to a\
  \ few months but I always had family or friends around me to get through it. But\
  \ this time, I was too far away from home (India) and had no one that I trusted\
  \ enough to let in. On the contrary, I tried disconnecting from my family to protect\
  \ them from being helpless. \nRosa and I had always used names to address each other.\
  \ But that day, she called me \u2018mijo\u2019 several times, perhaps to let me\
  \ know that she was there to help and that she really understood how I felt. Having\
  \ finished my food, I thanked her and went back to my room. A dilemma loomed over\
  \ me to confine in her with my story.\nOver the next few days, she would check with\
  \ me in the mornings to see how I was doing (sometimes just to get me out of bed)\
  \ and invite me for food. As our interaction grew, I shared about my mother and\
  \ how she had become a friend to understand my internal conflicts. I talked to Javier\
  \ over Facebook to know about his journey. Interestingly, through my viewpoints,\
  \ she was able to understand her son better. \nOver the next several months, I shared\
  \ with her about my personal life, about my classes, my trips in Colombia, met her\
  \ family and introduced my girlfriend. In December, I got to meet Javier when he\
  \ came home for the Christmas holidays. With him, my family grew and I found a brother\
  \ in this distant land. \nAlthough I don\u2019t live with them anymore, they are\
  \ my family in Colombia as I continue my journey here."
