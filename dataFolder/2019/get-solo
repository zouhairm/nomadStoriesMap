Text: "When my friends found out that I\u2019m heading to France, well more specifically\
  \ to Paris! Everyone was in awe, some are like too excited for my post standing\
  \ right next to The Eiffel, some are a like so very much of a proud supportive friends,\
  \ and lastly, those whom I called.. \u201Cthe scared cat friends\u201D :)\n\nI received\
  \ a lot of compliments when my friends knew that I\u2019ll be traveling ALONE for\
  \ the first time. I equally received a lot of negativity and hearsay\u2019s about\
  \ the place where I\u2019m heading to. Stuff like..\n\u201CThere are too many pick\
  \ pocket in Paris!\u201D\n\u201CEurope is a place where nobody reaches their hand\
  \ to you\u201D \n\u201COh! Be careful about this african people in the streets of\
  \ Paris\u201D\n\u201CBe carefull whom you to talk to. The will fool you!\u201D \
  \ etc. and so on and so forth.\n\nBut along the way on the bus going to Paris from\
  \ Amsterdam.. I sat down with an African guy - we never talked along the way as\
  \ I was a little aloof and just wanted to sleep the whole time.\n\nAfter a long\
  \ travel of almost 7 hours in the bus. We finally reached Paris. The bus dropped\
  \ us in one of the main Train station in Paris. - I actually don\u2019t know where\
  \ I\u2019m going too and I had no data during that time!! And totally freaked out\
  \ knowing that there was no elevator on the said station and I was carrying a 20kg\
  \ trolley bag plus almost 7kg back pack! And saw this \u201COh my god\u201D long\
  \ stairs up to the train station!  This african guy who were seated right next to\
  \ me in the bus did not hesitate to help me carry my bag up to the station! I wasn\u2019\
  t expecting that! He even send me to my hostel when he knew where I\u2019m going\
  \ to stay upon our talks in the train! He never asked anything in return!! That\
  \ guy is an Angel!\n\nHe became my friend up to this time, and I will always cherish\
  \ those kind of people! \n\nSo Paris was never a bad place for me in my experience!\
  \ - I booked a bed in an all girls room and was able to meet other solo travelers\
  \ which made my trip even more exciting! \n\nWaking up the next morning.. We are\
  \ 4 ladies in our room - 2 from brazil and 1 from morroco. I\u2019ve never had any\
  \ difficulties in talking with these ladies! They were so friendly and approachable\
  \ too! After a morning talk with them we decided to go gor a walk all together and\
  \ have lunch outside, after we went to our different tours and agendas. We\u2019\
  ve agreed that we\u2019ll gonna be meeting at night at the bar down our hostel.\n\
  \nThe day was long and we definitely need a glass of wine to end our day right!!\
  \ We partied the whole night as if there will be no tomorrow! Indeed! Party in Paris\
  \ are awesome! We\u2019re able to meet other people like from Canada, Argentina,\
  \ US, etc. that night was really awesome as if we knew each other for a long time\
  \ already!!! \n\nAnd the rest is history! :) \n\nOh Paris! You are a dream came\
  \ to life! \u2665\uFE0F"
