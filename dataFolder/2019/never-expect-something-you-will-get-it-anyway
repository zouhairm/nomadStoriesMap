Text: "Ulvie here, an-almost 22yo girl from a country full of islands, Indonesia.\
  \ A girl who always expecting things included to travel anywhere I want, although\
  \ I couldn't get through there.\n\n\"Don't expect something on life\" that was what\
  \ my Mexican best friend told me all the time, because truly he said it would disappoint\
  \ ourselves, just let it flow and see what's in front of you. \n\nAfter he told\
  \ me that brilliant motto, I forced myself to stop expecting anything, including\
  \ traveling. I always expecting and dreaming to meet a foreigb lover, to travel\
  \ with a him, to exploring the city with motorbike, to swimming on the beach and\
  \ starring the sunset, trying new foods, having an amazing night in a beautiful\
  \ resort and so on.. And as what my friend have told me, since I expecting things\
  \ too much it was disappointed me much too, yes extremely much. Since I had those\
  \ dreams, I never could achieve ANY OF THEM, I feel inconsolable inside.\n\nAfter\
  \ a while trying to force myself, I finally can get use to stop expecting things\
  \ on my mind, and the miracle is come by itself, seriously it was a miracle. \n\
  October 2017, as I remember it was the first time I 'met' this European guy online\
  \ in an application, I bravely said met even though we never touch each other's\
  \ hands. I feel something like love on him only by text, I feel he speaks my heart\
  \ only by his words, I feel he always beside me, hug me, and kiss me towards the\
  \ emojis, I feel in love and loved by him deeply. \n\nAfter some time talking we\
  \ found a fact that we both do love to travel. And again without expecting things,\
  \ we talked about doing a trip together, honestly I wasn't sure that time although\
  \ I feel something on him but as you know to meet in real life everything would\
  \ be different than 'met' on the screen, right? \nI said to him \"come here if you\
  \ want to meet me, I couldn't meet you on your country and I don't want to travel\
  \ alone to the place you mentioned before\". He was worried though, he said, after\
  \ that I was just thinking that he won't come and I can't hope anything. \n\nSix\
  \ months later, we still talking as normally, and suddenly he called me to show\
  \ his flight ticket coming to Indonesia! Oh my Lord, I was so happy, shock, nervous,\
  \ want to cry, want to scream, want to jump, want to do things that people do when\
  \ they're achieve a prize - yes that was my feeling. \n\nThis guy is finally came,\
  \ came out through the exit door of my airport, bring the luggage on his hand, and\
  \ the backpack on his back, he looks the same on the picture, \"luckily. Yes it's\
  \ him\" said my heart (fyuh). He rans to me, I feel stuck seriously, but I walk\
  \ faster to him, we finally hug each other, kissed and cry, because I was sooo happy!\n\
  \nAs I've told you before, we both love to travel. From Jakarta the journey as a\
  \ couple has begun. We took a bus to Bandung to my city, and then flight to Yogyakarta\
  \ to see and to feel the traditionally vibe over there, eating foods he never ate\
  \ before, exploring the city with motorbike \"ah it was what I dreaming of, it's\
  \ happenning now\" my mind said while hugging him tighter from the back. To realize\
  \ more dreams of mine, we took a flight to Bali yes the most famous city and island\
  \ of my country. To spending days swimming on the beach, looking the sunset, having\
  \ some party like youth does, showering under waterfalls and stay in a perfect resort\
  \ with beach as our view, was so romantic. \n\nI'm so happy I already fulfilled\
  \ some of my dreams, (I still have more ofcourse) they are really coming true when\
  \ we don't expect things. Believe me, just trust your heart, follow everything what\
  \ you need to do, let it flow, and stop expecting, don't worry, beautiful things\
  \ will come out in the right time."
