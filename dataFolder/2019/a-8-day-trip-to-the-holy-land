Text: "In Autumn 2017, I had one of my biggest travel dreams that came true, I was\
  \ finally travelling to the Holy land - Israel. I landed in Tel Aviv a few hours\
  \ before one of the most important Israeli public holidays started. This public\
  \ holiday is called Yom Kippur and everything stopped and closed and on top of that,\
  \ people are not even allowed to drive. Therefore, my first two days were spent\
  \ to discover the city by walking around, meeting people at the hostel in which\
  \ I was staying and of course enjoying the big beaches of Tel Aviv as everything\
  \ was closed. During the sunset of the second day, Yom Kippur was ending and life\
  \ was starting again so I made the most of the opportunity to discover the Israeli\
  \ cuisine and Tel Aviv night life. On the third day, while I was walking to Jaffa\
  \ Port - the old city of Tel Aviv, I met with an American backpacker girl who asked\
  \ me to take a picture of her. As she was also going to Jaffa Port, we decided to\
  \ go together. She was a very nice and interesting person who had travelled to so\
  \ many countries over the world. On the fourth day, I was on the road to the Holy\
  \ city - Jerusalem. I was so excited to discover this city. It was only 1 hour far\
  \ away from Tel Aviv by bus, yet the atmosphere was totally different. In fact,\
  \ it was way more religious, traditional and full of historical sites such as the\
  \ famous Western Wall and the Temple Mount. Walking across the Old City of Jerusalem\
  \ was also a very rich cultural experience as it consists of 4 districts that are\
  \ the Armenian one, the Christian one, the Jewish one and the Muslim one. Actually,\
  \ I took a free walking tour there with a local guide who showed us the must-see\
  \ places and told us about the history of the Old City of Jerusalem. On the fifth\
  \ day, I took a day trip to the Masada National Park where I admired the sun from\
  \ the fortress, rising right behind the hills of Jordan with the Dead Sea in the\
  \ foreground. It was really worth getting up that early to see this spectacular\
  \ and speechless sunrise. After that, I went to the Oasis of Ein Gedi and then to\
  \ Kalia beach by the Dead Sea. It was a great experience because the Dead Sea is\
  \ so salty that the whole body just floats, in fact it is not recommended to put\
  \ the head in the water due to the big amount of salt, it may burn the eyes. After\
  \ that, I went back to Jerusalem where I met by accident with a Dutch backpacker\
  \ that I had met in Tel Aviv a few days ago so we went for a dinner together. On\
  \ the sixth day, I went back to Tel Aviv and decided to explore more the north of\
  \ the country so on the seventh day I took a \u201Csherut\u201D (=shared taxi) to\
  \ go up to Haifa and of course visit the Bah\xE1\u2019\xED Gardens. On the eighth,\
  \ it was the end of my trip, I still had a full day to spend in Tel Aviv as my flight\
  \ was in the evening. To summarize, this travel was one of the best I had ever had\
  \ and for sure I will try to come back again very soon. Thank you for reading me."
