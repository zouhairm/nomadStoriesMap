Text: "At eight years old, I knew I\u2019d live at Hogwarts when I grew up. Obviously\
  \ the magical castle was going to be my home from the very first page of the Harry\
  \ Potter books.\n\nAt eighteen, I\u2019d re-evaluated my plans. After my Hogwarts\
  \ letter got lost in the Owl Post (the only explanation), I\u2019d decided that\
  \ a sensible, steady job like law was a better idea; a Good Decision that would\
  \ set me up for the rest of my life. \n\nAt twenty-three, I found myself handing\
  \ in my notice at the little English village law firm that had promised me a stable\
  \ career and everything that came with it. I\u2019d planned to save for a house,\
  \ set up a pension, do sensible grown-up things, and now I had no idea what was\
  \ going to happen next. At most, I figured I\u2019d move onto another sensible,\
  \ steady job somewhere in the UK. I certainly didn\u2019t expect to be packing my\
  \ bags and relocating half way around the world. \n\nWhen I fired off the email\
  \ saying I\u2019d love to take a job teaching English in China I was packing a backpack;\
  \ two months exploring New Zealand beckoned. I thought that trip would be enough\
  \ for me \u2013 a once-in-a-lifetime, classic quarter-life crisis blowout. Incorrect.\
  \ \n\nFor the record, backpacking round New Zealand was fantastic, and part of me\
  \ will always dream of going back. I hiked countless miles, drank from mountain\
  \ streams, saw the sunrise over the ocean with only penguins for company, watched\
  \ the rugby and ended up dancing till 2am, and met people who changed my life. But\
  \ China was the big unknown, the real \"what the hell is going to happen next?\"\
  \n\nOf course, I knew it would be Different in China. And, in many ways, It Is.\
  \ Complaints about millennials spending all their time on their phones pale into\
  \ insignificance compared to the surgical attachment that Chinese people under the\
  \ age of 50 have to their technology, and I refuse to accept that it's ok to play\
  \ music on phones in public places without headphones. \n\nI knew the culture would\
  \ be Different, although I hadn't expected quite how big some of the differences\
  \ would be. As the only white person in the neighbourhood, I don't draw strange\
  \ looks so much as continuous open stares. The sound of spitting will forever make\
  \ my back crawl, and I'm not equipped to deal with buying chicken with the head\
  \ and feet still attached. Give me a processed, pre-packaged chicken breast any\
  \ day. \n\nIt's been more than a little challenging to adjust to life in China.\
  \ Gone are the mountain vistas and endless open spaces of New Zealand, and gone\
  \ are the rolling hills and stone cottages of my corner of England, replaced by\
  \ filthy city streets and skyscrapers dwarfing the millions of people crammed into\
  \ them.  \n\nBut I\u2019ve been amazed by how much joy I find in the daily routine.\
  \ I may be stared at openly whenever I get on the train, but I was followed around\
  \ a bookshop by a little girl who was determined to give me an English grammar book\
  \ to help her practise. I spent another train journey playing clapping games with\
  \ a grandmother and her twin grandchildren who were fighting to sit on my lap and\
  \ show off their English.\n\nI\u2019ve made baristas laugh when I tried to order\
  \ coffee and got so confused when they replied in perfect English that I thanked\
  \ them in German (I desperately needed that coffee), and spent half an hour deep\
  \ in conversation with a volunteer at a temple that was so awe-inspiring I\u2019\
  m not sure it was real. \n\nAt twenty-four I packed a suitcase and moved to China.\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect a lot of things \u2013  children being held over bins rather\
  \ than toilets was a surprise \u2013 but when I found myself crouched on a packed\
  \ train, with a small Chinese boy painstakingly sounding out the words I\u2019ve\
  \ known by heart since I was seven (\u201CMr and Mrs Dursley of number 4, Privet\
  \ Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much.\u201D\
  ), I realised that sometimes not knowing what to expect is the best way to be."
