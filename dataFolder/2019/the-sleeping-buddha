Text: "Amidst the purest air, I am here to rediscover myself, sitting on the meadow,\
  \ surrounded by no consumer, looking around through the clouds at the unknown. As\
  \ I look forward towards my stairway to heaven, the clouds seem to add a dramatic\
  \ beauty to this already magical mountainous landscape. The chilling breeze and\
  \ the brown grass announce that the winter has already arrived.\n\nWhen a person\
  \ is lost in the city, overburdened by commitments, he turns towards the nature.\
  \ So did I. I planned to trek through the conifers and meadows to a Himalayan Hamlet,\
  \ Tonglu, located on the Indian side of the India-Nepal border. Situated at an altitude\
  \ of 10,070 ft., one can trek up here for about 14 kilometers from Manebhanjan,\
  \ a village well connected to Darjeeling. The place is barely populated with only\
  \ 2-3 houses. A family runs an accommodation facility up here and also cooks food\
  \ for the travelers. Far from the complications of the modern world, you can see\
  \ innocence in the eyes of these extremely hardworking mountain people, treating\
  \ everyone with equal warmth.\n\nI was trekking on a very cloudy day and with high\
  \ probabilities of downpour. I could find almost no one throughout the trail except\
  \ the small villages I passed by. Solace was all I wanted and the nature seemed\
  \ to offer me it's exaggerated verse. I hummed songs and walked wriggly up my path,\
  \ careless. Once in a while I would sit down, not because I was tired, but to feel\
  \ the aura and to look around and observe how small it feels to be a human being\
  \ in such an open land. The tall mountains plunging into the deep valleys covered\
  \ by huge trees, everything is enormous. A small village could be seen faraway,\
  \ peeping through the clouds, clinging to the steep side of the valley as if about\
  \ to lose grip, expressing how vulnerable we humans actually are in this world of\
  \ intelligent design.\n\nThe destination had more to grant. Tonglu offers a view\
  \ of the beautiful range of the Kanchenjunga popularly known as \u201Cthe Sleeping\
  \ Buddha\u201D. The arrangement of the peaks and the angle of view from this place\
  \ makes it look like a sleeping man and since most of the people in this part of\
  \ the world follow Buddhism, they call it the sleeping Buddha. But I was not fortunate\
  \ enough. The weather seemed to get better only after the sunset. The night sky\
  \ though was stupendous, with no moon and a sky full of stars. You cannot see that\
  \ many stars from the polluted cities, not even a tenth of it. It was the brightest\
  \ patch of the Milky Way I had ever seen, extending from one side of the sky to\
  \ another through the tiny twinkles. It was difficult to stop ogling at them but\
  \ the temperature was drastically falling and standing out in open would not have\
  \ been wise. I crawled into my bed with a hope that the Sleeping Buddha will be\
  \ visible tomorrow.\n\nI woke up at least twice at night thinking I missed the glimpse\
  \ of what I was dreaming about, that was the level of excitement. Finally, it was\
  \ time, I could see some light through the window. I rushed out of the cottage only\
  \ to slip down. It had snowed, the whole place was white, the first natural snow\
  \ I had ever seen. Then I looked at the most anticipated direction. And there it\
  \ was, shinning bright in the sky, as red as the sun itself, rising above the clouds,\
  \ the mighty Kanchenjunga. With the slightest of imagination, it indeed looked like\
  \ a sleeping man. I fell on my knees with snow in both my hands, and thanked the\
  \ nature with a drop freezing down my cheek, satisfaction I had never experienced\
  \ before. I sat there quietly, did not move an inch till it hid behind the clouds\
  \ again, as if it had shown up only for me, and now the most beautiful play has\
  \ come to an end."
