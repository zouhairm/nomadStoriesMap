Text: "And then came the bells from The Torre de la Vela, their slow, powerful, deep\
  \ sounds echoing of the walls throughout the city of Granada Spain.\n\nI had finally\
  \ finessed my way to the edge of the square in the Mirador San Nicolas, where a\
  \ crowd of people lined the wall, sitting for photos for a chance to have the reddish\
  \ walls of the Alhambra as the backdrop. Located in front of the neighborhood of\
  \ Albaycin and on the left bank of the Darro River, this stoic build was there before\
  \ me, a fortress described by the Moorish as \u201Ca pearl set in emeralds\u201D\
  . All I could do was hope that the panorama view on my phone would be able to capture\
  \ it all.\n\nI was embedded in a sea of older Americans, Expats, and children, watching\
  \ as they engaged in acts of tourism. The sounds of their high-shutter speed cameras\
  \ clicking away and the infamous selfie sticks unsheathed like swords in the air\
  \ battling for the perfect angle that would induce just the right amount of FOMO\
  \ from their loved ones back home.\n\nThen I felt a hand at my shoulder and looked\
  \ up to find Sam, the curly-haired tour guide from the Makuto Hostel, where I was\
  \ staying with my friend, Lonnie from Los Angeles. He had taken Lonnie and I along\
  \ with a Peruvian woman who was passing through heading to Morocco, the scenic route.\
  \ We made our way through the narrow uneven cobbled stoned streets and the white\
  \ exterior houses of the Albaycin on a guided tour of Granada. Yet, behind the same\
  \ wired framed glasses he had on earlier, was an urgent look in his eyes. \n\n\u201C\
  We must leave now, we if we\u2019re going to make it by sunset.\u201D I hesitated\
  \ to move, for the soles of my feet were sore and I was exhausted from the days\
  \ walk. He saw my apprehension, \u201CDon\u2019t worry this will be worth it, it\u2019\
  s the best view in Granada\u201D he said.  I was born and raised in Los Angeles;\
  \ I shuttered to think there was better view than golden hour on a hot summer\u2019\
  s day at Santa Monica Pier.\n\nThe bells rang again and the herd of tourists that\
  \ once stood in solidarity began to disperse quickly with feet moving in every direction.\
  \ The group followed Sam as he turned and headed down a side street. \n\nThe walk\
  \ felt like a curse out of Greek mythology and as the sun grew lower in the sky,\
  \ the streets began to run together in my mind. The white walls began to blacken,\
  \ ceaseless like an endless tunnel. I was weakening and desired relief, but the\
  \ thought of seeing this view that Sam spoke so highly of, kept my feet moving forward.\
  \ Suddenly, I saw it off in the distance up on a hill, the Eremite San Miguel Alto.\
  \ It was a white church with four stripes made of brick going down it\u2019s front-side.\
  \ There were people sitting on a stone ledge in front of the church, and below that\
  \ were even more people nestled into the grassy hillside. \n\nSam led the group\
  \ to an open pocket of grass just mid-way up the hill. We settled in, while Sam\
  \ passed around a sack of cookies and a few cans of Mahou beer. As I looked at the\
  \ people around me, I observed the faces of friendship, the interlocked arms of\
  \ romance bundled under blankets, the rebellious youth of teenagers, with t-shirts\
  \ hugging their skin against the night air. \n\nThe sun was all but gone now and\
  \ what was left as I looked out before me was something I never expected. The lights\
  \ from the Alhambra and from the bars and the stores illuminated the city with a\
  \ ring of light that glowed against the surrounding darkness.\n\nMy eyes could make\
  \ out the coves of the Sacromonte below, where the Gypsies hung their garments on\
  \ wires. And as the bells rang for a third time and everyone peered off with their\
  \ eyes forward towards the city, I felt it again, the same solidarity I had felt\
  \ back in the Mirador de San Nicolas. It came back, it had returned again."
