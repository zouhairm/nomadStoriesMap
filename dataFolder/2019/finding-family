Text: "I travelled to the England to find family.\n\nMy father lost all his family\
  \ in parts of the world when there was war in South Africa. We found a few on Facebook,\
  \ One in the UK, Two in Australia and lastly a group in Portugal. My father and\
  \ I saved enough to travel to the UK in 2008 and Met my Aunt for the first time\
  \ and my father Had just met his sister who he hadn't seen since 1985. \n\nSaddest\
  \ part to the story was I found out that the reason my aunt left South Africa was\
  \ that she had 3 sons. Aged 3,4 and 6 they all where set alight in there home in\
  \ the Civil fighting. Once she got to the UK she met a man and had 3 daughters now\
  \ aged 28,29 and 31 the same ages her sons might of been. Hearing that story made\
  \ me realize that finding my father's family would lead us to many stories and happy\
  \ moments, seeing my father reunited with his only family brought so much joy to\
  \ him that I promised I would find them all. \n\nWe have been trying to travel to\
  \ Portugal for the last few years but funds haven't been the best so we starting\
  \ to wonder will he die never meeting any or will we sell all we have and travel\
  \ the world together hunting the lost family members."
