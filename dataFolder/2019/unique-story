Text: "\"Good morning Sir,  How are you?\" I said.\n\n \"I am good, thank you. I \
  \ would like to buy a keychain\" he answered.\n\nImmediately I had shown him where\
  \ was the place where he could to find the keychains.  When I saw him I had a lot\
  \ of tenderness, he was a regular size, pale skin, blue eyes, regular weight. he\
  \ looked like 70 years old. I felt something inside my heart. \"I should to approached\
  \ him asking if he needs some help,\" I told myself.\n\nI walked toward him  \"\
  Sir, what name do you looking for?\" I said.\n\n\"Kate\" he answered me.\n\n\"Let\
  \ me help to find that,\" I empathize.\n\n\"Is Kate your wife's name?\"\n\nHe stared\
  \ at me and answered, \"No, I have divorced many years ago, when I was young...\"\
  \n\n It was an unexpected answer. At that moment my thought was. \"As always asking\
  \ untimely questions\". seeing his face I could notice how he still had pain remembering\
  \ that situation.\"I am afraid of this question,\" I said.\n\nI saw how his face\
  \ was turning smiling. He said \"Young woman do not worry now everything is fine.\
  \ My friend name is Kate and the keychain is for her.\"\n\nWhen we finally found\
  \ that, we started to find another with the name of the Army. I was so curious If\
  \ he was part of the Army. I told myself lets go make a question it would not be\
  \ like the first. I said, \"Were you in the USA Army?\" he smiled weakly \" I used\
  \ to be part of Navy I retired years ago\" he whispered.\n\nHe told me \"I would\
  \ like to pay for those\"\n\nI accompanied him toward the cashier when he began\
  \ to count his money I thought \"probably he had not enough money to pay that\"\
  \ I told him \" Sir,  I can pay that for you\" He was glad.\n\n\"What is your name?,\"\
  \ I said.\n\nWith his soft voice, He said something like \"T...\" I felt so frustrated\
  \ because he repeated that three times, even so, I could not understand it. \"Excuse\
  \ me. Sir, May you write in this paper your name? I asked. I saw how he picked up\
  \ the pen with both trembling hands. \"This happens when people get old,\" he took\
  \ a breath looking at the paper. At that moment I wanted to disappear \"how had\
  \ it happened?\" I thought. It was one minute that seemed like an eternity. He finished\
  \ writing his name, showing all my emotions and my feelings I read it up \"Mr. Terry\"\
  .\n\n\"It is me, You have done well,\" he said."
