Text: "Dhahanu Valley...! (Visited By Me On 26 & 27th June, 2017)\_\n\nThe valley\
  \ is known as the 'Land Of The Aryans' as the people there are considered the purest\
  \ descendants of the ancient Indo-Europeans.\_\n\nThe Villages Dha and Hanu are\
  \ situated at a distance of approximately 163 km to the northest of the Leh. Crossed\
  \ through, Kaltsey, Domkhar, Skurbunchan, Achinathang. In the valley I found many\
  \ villages, However I (Tourists) was allowed to visit the villages Dha and Hanu\
  \ only. Being situated on lower altitude thus Villages face more warmer weather\
  \ than parts of Leh-Ladakh. Major attractions I found in these villages were to\
  \ see and meet pure Aryans, landscapes inside and around these villages and most\
  \ important I have had a chance to know the life of Drokpa community. At the confluence\
  \ of the river Shayok and Indus in the Kargil region west of Leh live a people known\
  \ as Drok-Pa. I literally felt they are racially and culturally distinct from Ladakhis.\
  \ One curious feature I came to know was, Their abhorrence of the cow or any of\
  \ its products. They are music lovers. I stayed in Makspon homestay, Mr. Sonam who\
  \ owns it. There were Mr. Sonam's Mom, Sisters and Daughters, too. I found them\
  \ completely lovable people. Mr. Sonam said Ibex is specially sacred to Drok-pa\
  \ community. I found their women costume so different and interesting.\_\P\PThere\
  \ are 2000 people settled in Five villages of this valley. Kids of Hanu thang gave\
  \ me Love For The Life , which I would not be able to forget anyday. One special\
  \ Boy in my all selfies, with Red Tshirt gave me new name 'YOU, NAUGHTY GIRL' as\
  \ he was too naughty and pulling my clothes and hair so I addressed him NAUGHTY\
  \ BOY. ;)\_\n\nI would love to visit Dha and Hanu again.\PThanks for reading My\
  \ Blog . :) \PLots Of Love...!"
