Text: "As we gradually started to rome around the beautiful scenarios and lavishing\
  \ natural views of the country portugal,we also endured the extra ordinary connection\
  \ with the local community because of their extremely kind and generous behavior\
  \ we came to know with in no time that our journey will be the splendid one of our\
  \ life time.While exploring the country portugal, it was giving us immense pleasure\
  \ to be gathered along the local people. They were so caring and obviously the food\
  \ they made us try was just out of this world. \nAnd most importantly as i was also\
  \ a soccer player and people of Portugal go crazy for football i played with them\
  \ in few matches and it was  a great plot for me to get to know more about them.We\
  \ had a great talk on Portuguese national players like Cristiano Ronaldo, Nani etc.It\
  \ was a funny talk though, we really did enjoyed that moment.Furtherly they also\
  \ took me to a national stadium to make watch a live match,It was a great time that\
  \ i spent there in the ground watching the match and we shared food, dresses.I tried\
  \ to learn there language and in return i taught them mine national language.Well\
  \ according to me it was easy for me to get envolved with local community because\
  \ of there generous and kind behavior and the liberal thinking for the guests.It\
  \ was an honour to be with them."
