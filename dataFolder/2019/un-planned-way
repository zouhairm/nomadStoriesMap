Text: "Heroes don\u2019t feature in the stories around forts. A villain sometimes\
  \ makes for a more interesting tale. That is the legend I hear when I land in Kannur.\
  \ Colonial flavour runs high in the town even centuries after Vasco da Gama landed\
  \ in Kerala (nearly 100 km south at Kozhikode, in 1498). Driving around forts, lighthouses\
  \ and churches takes you to the era when battles were fought at sea and enemies\
  \ were thrown in dungeons.It is almost sunset and I am driving towards St Angelo\
  \ Fort in Kannur to listen to its stories.\n\nThe fort stands majestically with\
  \ history plastered all over the walls. Standing there I look out into the little\
  \ fishing hamlet. Children are playing hide and seek while their families watch,\
  \ disinterested. A guide walks up to me and narrates a story about a famous prisoner\
  \ of the fort. The only interesting element is that the captive who was locked up\
  \ in the fort was neither Dutch nor British. He was not an Indian king either, but\
  \ a fellow Portuguese. And the tale revolves around conspiracies woven 500 years\
  \ ago.\nThe sun has finally been tucked away in the clouds and we are deprived of\
  \ a rosy sunset. But I stare at the waters and wonder how the sea was once home\
  \ to fleets from all over Europe and the Middle East battling for control of the\
  \ spice trade. My reverie is interrupted by the tourist policeman who politely requests\
  \ us to leave as it is time to call it a day."
