Text: "I woke up with a red-wine hangover from the night before, which I justified\
  \ as the inevitable result of any proper stay in a hostel, and climbed on to a chartered\
  \ bus with 25 other American students.  We headed south from Esquel, a small town\
  \ in northern Patagonia, through the sleepy, snow-capped Andes, occasionally passing\
  \ a tienda in what looked like an otherwise undisturbed landscape.\n \nAs we weaved\
  \ through the Argentinian wilderness, we passed a mountain with a familiar phrase\
  \ etched into the side: \u201CNo a La Mina.\u201D No to mining. I knew we must be\
  \ getting close. We were on our way to visit a Mapuche community, native to the\
  \ land we were on and under constant attack by both its own government and international\
  \ companies, usually American, eager to rob them of their resources.\n \nDespite\
  \ this plunder, when my busload of Americans arrived, each member of our Mapuche\
  \ host family welcomed us with a kiss on both cheeks. We were surrounded on all\
  \ sides by bright green pastures and towering mountains of the deepest blue, punctuated\
  \ by a cement house with smoke rising from the chimney. With the bus engine silenced,\
  \ I heard only a nearby river running and the occasional crow of a rooster or bark\
  \ of a dog dutifully herding the cattle and sheep.\n \nAfter a short hike up from\
  \ where we arrived, our narrow path opened to a lookout view of the river, which\
  \ weaved through a valley of trees, brush, and gentle mountains extending in every\
  \ direction. Our guide showed us where several of his relatives had been buried\
  \ in a small clearing in the middle of the wilderness, which represented the Mapuche\u2019\
  s deep and permanent connection to the land. As he showed us around the immense\
  \ Patagonian forest, he explained that Mapuche spirituality is rooted in the land\
  \ they inhabit.\n \nAs I listened, I remembered the \u201CNo a La Mina\u201D sign,\
  \ and I was overcome by my nauseating American guilt. Here we were, a group of Americans\
  \ who had likely never even heard the word \u201CMapuche\u201D before this trip,\
  \ welcomed so lovingly into a place where American companies relentlessly destroyed\
  \ land that they had no right to. \n \nMy first trip outside of the United States\
  \ was during the 2016 presidential campaign, when I sometimes told people I was\
  \ from Canada to avoid embarrassing political discussions. This always worked until\
  \ I inevitably let a \u201Cy\u2019all\u201D slip and gave myself up. It had always\
  \ felt innocent, just a funny thing I said that made me feel better.  This time\
  \ it was different: I could not avoid the discomfort, the creeping sickness. Our\
  \ hosts were showing us a kindness that had never \u2013 not once \u2013 been extended\
  \ to them, and suddenly my lie didn\u2019t feel so innocent. It felt hypocritical.\
  \ It felt selfish, the exercise of a privilege earned by an accident of geography.\
  \ I felt like a co-conspirator. \n \nIf my hosts had injustice on their minds, however,\
  \ they did not let it show. We spent the rest of the afternoon passing around yerba\
  \ mate and playing soccer in an overgrown field. The dogs chased the soccer ball,\
  \ and, once they tired, we competed for their attention to their great delight.\
  \ I had the surreal feeling of being with family in an unfamiliar place.\n \nI would\
  \ come to experience that feeling of being welcomed as family over and over while\
  \ traveling in Latin America, an unqualified kindness that always felt undeserved.\
  \ As my government debated a wall raised to protect us from an imaginary threat,\
  \ the people against whom it would be raised did nothing but accept me, again and\
  \ again and again. This dichotomy becomes more brutal with each passing day and\
  \ each passing offense. No one can heal the wounds of colonialism and consumerism\
  \ that have shaped our current reality. But, kindness this unconditional is transformative,\
  \ and its power overcomes all barriers, all walls, and all efforts to mine it away."
