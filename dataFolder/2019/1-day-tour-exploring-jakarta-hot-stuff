  Go to the Symbol of Jakarta, Monas!\n We said you didn't go to Jakarta if you never\
  \ go to Monas or the National Monument. This is a symbol of Jakarta and one of the\
  \ highest monument in this city. You can go by transjakarta busway and walk in or\
  \ from the international Airport Soekarno Hatta just get in to Damri Bus that head\
  \ to Gambir then walk in. In this monument they saved the first Indonesia's flag\
  \ that was waved for the first time at august 17th 1945 and was hand made by the\
  \ wife of the proclamator Ir. Soekarno as also the first President of Indonesia.\
  \ There are also other historical things there that interesting to see. Inside the\
  \ monument, there is a lift that you can go to the top of the monument. This is\
  \ special because the top of the monument is build by pure gold and you also can\
  \ see the nicest view of Jakarta city. Next trip is going around in monas area and\
  \ take a picture with street performers that called ondel ondel. This big doll is\
  \ the old art culture of origin people in Jakarta called Betawi. Backthen this things\
  \ is performed at wedding ceremony and other celebration of betawi people. But now\
  \ is rarely find in other place because now more people non betawi live in Jakarta.\n\
