Text: "When I arrived, Zeus was crying for Heracles; big fat tears fell from the sky.\
  \ Not quite my vision of Athens. A new city... a new country, to add to my growing\
  \ list. I made a mental note to jot the time and place on the back page of my book.\
  \ A silly and sentimental habit, I know, but, for me, the silent dialogue with the\
  \ pages signified a shared adventure. Books are often my sole travel companions\
  \ (trust me, I like it that way).\n\nThe journey from the airport was solemn. As\
  \ the driver coursed through the wet streets, my eyes raced across every road sign,\
  \ desperate to decipher the words, using the basics I\u2019d gained a week prior\
  \ (thank you, omnipotent Gods of modernity: Google, Youtube, iTranslate). Soon I\
  \ was stepping out onto the soaked streets of Tavros. A sense of arrival swam through\
  \ me, alongside a notion of unfamiliarity. The excitement of somewhere new, everything\
  \ is to be gained. With each glance, a brand new and never before seen sight filled\
  \ my voracious eyes.\n\nShabby awnings, narrow streets, potholes, skinny sidewalks\
  \ and phosphorescent pharmacy signs. Huh. Where are the ruins, the cobblestones?\
  \ I had anticipated Greece\u2019s retort to Rome, but so far heard nothing.\n \n\
  My finger fumbled for the doorbell, again the relief of arrival and a stupefying\
  \ sense of foreignness washed over me. Is this the right door? Hope pressed the\
  \ buzzer harder than I did. \n\nSetting down my bags with a furtive smile, I imagined\
  \ what \u2018grateful\u2019 and \u2018polite\u2019 looked like, and did my best\
  \ to perform. Words were useless. My host, an elderly man, barely spoke English\
  \ and my aforementioned Greek education was by no means sufficient to convey thanks,\
  \ properly. He hobbled around, performing light switch demonstrations, smiling,\
  \ and making eye contact; settling me into my impermanent home. He left. \n\nThe\
  \ rain still poured. It was 5PM and dark outside. Day one would not be used to find\
  \ my supposed \u2018Grecian Rome\u2019. I sat down, looked at my dripping backpac.\
  \ Took off my shoes. Peered around the apartment. Home for a while, I thought. Silence\
  \ crept in, and a smile danced at the corners of my mouth.\n\nFour weeks earlier\
  \ - literally no more and no less \u2013 at 5PM, I sat across the table from my\
  \ \"corporate oppressor\" and nervously skirted the issue on my mind. At 5:25PM\
  \ all was said and done. I had quit my job. Soon my lifestyle, London (I\u2019m\
  \ still SO sorry, I do love you), and everything else I identified with, would be\
  \ a part of the \u2018me\u2019 I used to be. This was it: \u2018traveling\u2019\
  , indefinitely. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all work out. Moments later I left to explore\
  \ the drenched neighbourhood. Home for a while."
