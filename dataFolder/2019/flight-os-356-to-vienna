Text: "We always meet twice in life \u2013 as we say.\n\nIt was not the first time\
  \ I went to Vienna, however it was the first time I went there for him. While boarding\
  \ the plane, I had the pleasure of hearing some symphonies of Austrian's pride,\
  \ Mozart. I took a quick look at my boarding pass: seat 7F. I had opted for a seat\
  \ next to a porthole in the hope of admiring the beauty of the urban landscapes\
  \ and the Alps. As soon as I settled down comfortably, I immersed in my thoughts.\n\
  Suddenly, a man in his fifties, friendly-looking, dressed in a light gray suit,\
  \ wearing a tie that did not go unnoticed and rectangular glasses, settled on the\
  \ seat next to mine. He struggled to fasten his seatbelt, then made some jokes in\
  \ Austrian dialect to acquaintances to him sitting in front of us. All of a sudden,\
  \ I noticed that he was not the only one being well dressed. His male counterparts,\
  \ dressed in suits, his female colleagues, with perfect tidy hair \u2013 were very\
  \ elegant.\nBefore the plane took off, I sent a last SMS, both nervous and impressed,\
  \ \xAB\_Sweetheart, I think I'm sitting next to someone important...\_\xBB - \xAB\
  \_Talk to him\_\xBB.\nWell, that's easier said than done.\n\xAB\_Ladies and Gentlemen,\
  \ this is your captain speaking, on behalf of Austrian Airlines, let me welcome\
  \ you on board of this flight OS 356 to Vienna...\_\xBB \nI took out a chewing gum\
  \ from my purse, a reflex I had never given up since my first flight. I was so eager\
  \ to land and to find my Felix. We had planned an exciting weekend together\_: he\
  \ was going to show me places I did not know in Vienna \u2013 because it is the\
  \ city in which he lives now \u2013 and then we would go to Bratislava, the Slovak\
  \ capital, to enjoy a journey to the heart of quietness. \n\xAB\_... We wish you\
  \ a warm Servus and a pleasant flight.\_\xBB This expression from Bavaria and Austria\
  \ made me smile. \nTime passed until the flight attendant came to serve us to drink.\
  \ \xAB\_An orange juice, please\_\xBB, I asked. My neighbor ordered some wine and,\
  \ smiling at me, asked me where I came from. \xAB\_Wolfgang, nice to meet you.\_\
  \xBB \nFrom this moment on, we began the discussion which remained the most memorable\
  \ of my experiences in a plane. He offered me a glass of local white wine. He was\
  \ working at the Austrian Ministry of Economy and was returning from a meeting in\
  \ Brussels as an EU delegate. Being myself a French student in political science,\
  \ we found lots of common interests. He told me about his travels, his experiences\
  \ in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Georgia. The Balkans, the countries of\
  \ the Caucasus, all this represent two areas that are unknown to me and where I\
  \ dream of setting foot one day. I did not believe my ears. \nTime went really fast.\
  \ Finally, he gave me his mobile number and said, in a very natural way, \xAB\_\
  I was helped when I was younger, so now it's my job helping some young people build\
  \ their network. I wish you a pleasant stay in Vienna, do not forget to tell your\
  \ friend to show you around the vineyards and to go to Albertina. I hope to hear\
  \ from you soon.\_\xBB \n\nI did not expect to find a politician sitting next to\
  \ me on the plane. I did not expect to meet him again three days later at the airport\
  \ \u2013 on my way back home \u2013 neither.\n\xAB\_Hello Sarah, didn't you recognize\
  \ me? How was your week-end? I hope you will not forget to call me soon.\_\xBB \n\
  I do not know if this is one of the events we call chance or if it is just the way\
  \ things should happen. All I know is an enthusiastic discussion starting from my\
  \ accent and wine-related clich\xE9s, a common passion for Europe and a link with\
  \ the city of peace, located between East and West \u2013  opened up a number of\
  \ perspectives I did not imagine before\_: I was going to spend one of the best\
  \ summer of my youth and start a new life in Vienna with the man I love."
