Text: "Have you ever stepped inside a curtain in the middle of a wall on a street\
  \ in Brno? If the answer is yes, then you know exactly what I have experienced.\
  \ If you don\u2019t even know where Brno is, I can guarantee you\u2019ll want to\
  \ be there yourself soon.\n\nIt was 8pm. Still light out and we knew exactly what\
  \ we were looking for. Google Maps had guided us to Husova Street and there wasn\u2019\
  t much to it. Did this place even exist? Was it just some wicked ploy of the locals\
  \ for the tourists? Were we too early? The answers to these questions are yes, no\
  \ and questionable.\n\nUpon brushing aside the curtains and knocking on the grand\
  \ concealed door we were greeted by a man in a theatrical ringmaster costume. He\
  \ looked at us expectantly through the gap of the partially opened door and asked\
  \ what we wanted. As earlier advised, I replied simply \u2018Super Panda Circus\u2019\
  \ in a questioning tone and he beckoned us through the doorway.\n\nOnce inside we\
  \ were given shot-glass portions of some herbal tea to cleanse our pallets. As we\
  \ were drinking our drinks, our heads were turned by another knock on the door.\
  \ These expectant guests were, however, turned away as they ignorantly enquired\
  \ \u2018is this the bar?\u2019 ... don\u2019t make their mistake. Also ... don't\
  \ be fooled by the name ... this is no circus.\n\nNever had I come across a place\
  \ so peculiar. We were led up a dark stairwell and guided to a private booth in\
  \ a dimly lit room. Once settled, glasses of water arrived on our shelf. We were\
  \ then asked by a waitress to pick a number from 1 to 16. My companion chose 7,\
  \ got told what the drink consisted of, and was happy with the choice. I chose 15,\
  \ a drink not to my taste. I then chose 5, only to find it was a gin mix. I don\u2019\
  t like gin. The waitress, deciding I was fussy, then proceeded to ask me questions\
  \ like: do you want it dry? fruity or creamy? rum-based? And that worked out for\
  \ the best because she came back with exactly the drink I didn\u2019t even know\
  \ I was looking for. It was a rum-based fruity mix ... don\u2019t ask me what fruits\
  \ because my pallet isn\u2019t that advanced ... but I can tell you that it was\
  \ very, very nice.\n\nNever have I felt so at ease. I felt as though I had been\
  \ transported away from reality and into this dark, exclusive bubble. I suppose\
  \ there is a certain danger to feeling so comfortable in a place. You forget your\
  \ worries. In my case that was in regard to money, because those drinks were on\
  \ the expensive side, but this wasn't an opportunity to be missed. I just had to\
  \ find out what they would bring me. And watching them make those drinks was a continuation\
  \ of the theatrical spectable we were first introduced to at the door. We, the audience,\
  \ relaxed in our seats and the bartenders on their stage, treating every drink creation\
  \ as an individual performance, that I, for one, could not peel my eyes away from.\n\
  \nNever have I quite lost my sense of time quite like I did in that room. With no\
  \ windows exposing any elements of the natural world, you are quite sheltered. Isolated\
  \ even. The whole experience was quite other-worldly and mystical. I knew I was\
  \ looking for a bar, and a perculiar one at that ... but this was something quite\
  \ unexpected and certainly not like anything I had experienced before."
