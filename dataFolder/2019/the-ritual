Text: "To appease the evil spirits you slaughter a ram and hang its intestines from\
  \ the branches of the forest altar.\n\nTo appease the good spirits you offer cookies,\
  \ milk, tea and vodka.\n\nTo appease a traveler you invite him to witness it all.\n\
  \n\u201CHe'll fly, of course,\u201D Lamayeva says.\n\u201CFly? Like fly fly? Are\
  \ you sure?\u201D\n\u201CYes silly, how else?\u201D she answers, so casual. Inside\
  \ the sacred grove, I believe her. \n\nThe rope around the meadow divides two worlds,\
  \ the mundane and the magical. Gates to other dimensions will soon open and gods\
  \ will descend from the skies.\n\nI check the wristwatch. My visa expires tomorrow\
  \ and like her father I\u2019ll soon have to fly. He may be able to bend the laws\
  \ of physics to his will, but for me time and bureaucracy are unappeasable.\n\n\
  A human skull rests atop the chief shaman\u2019s staff as he jumps and hisses, his\
  \ tongue whirling. The spirits have possessed him. Dozens of others follow, trembling\
  \ and shaking in the same pattern, sinking to the ground and rising, following the\
  \ drums like waves upon a spirit\u2019s shore.\n\nLamayeva's father stands under\
  \ the sacred birches, a blue and silken kimono resting on his shoulders. He waits\
  \ in silence for the gods to arrive. Once they come they\u2019ll tie their horses\
  \ to the treetops above and he'll go and meet them. Up. \n\n\u201CCan you pass me\
  \ the camera? Plee-aase?\u201D Lamayeva pleads.\n\nShe is the chosen one, predestined\
  \ to become a great shamaness of her people. She just turned fourteen. She loves\
  \ movies and is far more interested in my camera than the transcendental dance taking\
  \ place before us.\n\nI first read Carlos Castaneda when I was her age. And just\
  \ as she seems oblivious to the magic within her, I did not know at fourteen that\
  \ I would someday witness the kind of ritual described in his books. Let alone to\
  \ capture a human actually levitating in front of the camera. I check the time.\
  \ Who\u2019s going to fly first, me or him?\n\nShe takes the camera. In childlike\
  \ excitement we intertwine our fantasies. She\u2019s making her first movie, I\u2019\
  m immersing myself in the beating of the drums.\n\nThe sun sinks low. Sacrificial\
  \ meat hangs from the branches. Flies gorge on at the altars drenched in blood.\
  \ \n\nSuddenly I am sucked into the vortex. As if by magic, I see my whole journey.\
  \ Behind me, the glamour of the Moscow boulevards and coffee shops, the stark soviet\
  \ relics of Siberia\u2019s reinforced concrete and missile silos. Before me, the\
  \ sands of Gobi desert and Hokkaido\u2019s frosts. \n\nSpaces melt. I become a dot\
  \ on the rails of time.\n\nThe drumming intensifies. The rhythm shifts into hoofsteps\
  \ of the ancient horseborne gods. They\u2019re coming. I can feel it.\n\nThe alarm\
  \ sounds on my wrist, sharp and painful.\n\nLamayeva looks at me. Is she about to\
  \ cry?\n\n\u201CI'm sorry it takes them so long. Sometimes the gods are like that.\
  \ Sometimes they make us wait for days,\u201D she tells me.\n\u201CWell. There are\
  \ some forces in this world more powerful than the spirits of the taiga\u201D, I\
  \ say, the crushing monotone of a Russian immigration office cutting through.\n\n\
  She hands me my camera. A train howls in the distance, taking me further and back."
