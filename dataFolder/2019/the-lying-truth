Text: "\u201CHome home sweet home\u201D, finally I am back from the journey that changed\
  \ my life. I don\u2019t know if I am happy now or sad or maybe shocked but I think\
  \ I am ready to face the truth which always lied to me. I think it was difficult\
  \ but necessary. It was the most important couple of weeks in my life because what\
  \ I have learned will stay with me, guiding me in the rest of my life.\n     It\
  \ all began about three weeks ago, when I got accepted in a summer program. Two\
  \ weeks in New York, what is better that that! Or at least that is what I thought.\
  \ My whole life I was searching for one thing that I thought will make me happy.\
  \ That one thing was a scholarship to a university in America. I spent my whole\
  \ life working to achieve that goal.\n     It wasn\u2019t just the education what\
  \ attracted me, it was the country itself. The beautiful streets and decent people\
  \ who want to help me. But why I was sad? I just got accepted in a summer programs,\
  \ I should be happy. Yes, I remembered, I was happy till I saw the look on my mother\
  \ face when she knew about it. She was smiling but crying inside. And my father\
  \ he was proud but sad. Even my brother who hugged me very tightly, not because\
  \ I got accepted but because I would leave him.\n     I was a little confused because\
  \ of my family but I got normal and I remembered what I am about. It is a big step,\
  \ traveling to a foreign country which I only see it in movies. Finally, I get to\
  \ know new people and make new friends from another countries. It is exciting, I\
  \ was really proud and eager. I couldn\u2019t wait to get into the plane and leave\
  \ my old country. When I arrived in New York, I wasn\u2019t surprised, I saw it\
  \ a lot on TV but to be honest it was more beautiful than I expected.\n     \u201C\
  oh\u2026 finally I made it, I traveled to America!\u201D. Yes, that is true, I did\
  \ but why I wasn\u2019t happy. That question was always inside my head during the\
  \ whole journey. I kept asking myself \u201Cwhat is missing?\u201D. I did what I\
  \ want, I was with new people in a beautiful country, but why I was sad. I didn\u2019\
  t know the answer at first but finally I understood. I understood when I went to\
  \ bed and then remembered my mother and how I always check her before I get to sleep.\
  \ then I remembered my father and how he always come back at this time of the day\
  \ and bring us food and other stuff. And finally, I remembered my brother and how\
  \ he always hugs me before going to sleep. In the middle of all these thoughts,\
  \ I felt asleep.\n     The first couple of days, I was trying to make some friend\
  \ but it was really difficult. I think I was different, like a creep guy who looks\
  \ for a friend. And in the end of every day when I got back to bed, I remembered\
  \ my family and my country and how I was popular and loved. I kept asking myself\
  \ about all the thoughts that came to me when I was young, that I would be happy\
  \ if I went to a beautiful country. But now I realized that I wasn\u2019t happy\
  \ and all these thoughts were lying to me. They were fake.\n     It is not about\
  \ the beauty of a place or its people. Home will always be home and Family will\
  \ always be family. But the nature of human is dragging him to unknown places telling\
  \ him that he will be happy away from his family and friends, telling him that is\
  \ okay to travel away and leave everything. What a beautiful lie I wanted to believe!\
  \ But finally, I understood the lesson. Sometimes you want something very badly\
  \ that you are willing to give up everything for it even home and family and your\
  \ mind tells you that you would be happy, but trust me that is a lie from the truth."
