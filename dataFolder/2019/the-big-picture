Text: "I was 12 when I first came to Europe. My family packed up our lives into 17\
  \ suitcases and took off for a year-long stint in small town Sardinia. I knew no\
  \ Italian, had little understanding of Europe historically and was most upset I\
  \ was missing my little league baseball playoffs. My parents, on the other hand,\
  \ were thrilled to infuse my sister and me with the romantic notion of culture that\
  \ the States apparently lacked. Part of this cultural education meant touring each\
  \ and every church we ran into. There were probably at least 15 just in the small\
  \ town of Alghero where we lived. Having not been brought up with any religion (never\
  \ mind Catholicism) and with a non-existent understanding of art history, my sister\
  \ and I agreed that the most fascinating part of the experience was lighting a candle\
  \ in exchange for the smallest coin we had in our pocket \u2014not the most pious\
  \ practice perhaps. Needless to say, when it came to visiting churches, our motto\
  \ became \u201CSeen one, seen them all.\u201D \n\nSince then I\u2019ve visited most\
  \ of the mainstays of Europen churches but in particular Italy. From the majestic\
  \ duomos of Milan, Florence, and Siena to the humble churches in the small towns\
  \ of Piemonte, Lazio, Calabria, I\u2019d wager I\u2019ve entered over 100 places\
  \ of worship in Italy alone. I\u2019d hate to think I still subscribe to that juvenile\
  \ motto from my first European adventure, but the truth is, churches are still last\
  \ on my list to explore, especially now that I live in Italy. In fact, I was in\
  \ Bologna for a year and a half before I entered some of the most prized churches\
  \ of the city thanks to the urging of my visiting mother. \n\nI recently moved to\
  \ Sicily and when getting suggestions of things to do and see, I\u2019d heard over\
  \ and over of this famous Monreale cathedral just south of Palermo. I made sure\
  \ to visit every other attraction until an out-of-town friend forced me to take\
  \ the trip. As you might guess, I wasn\u2019t prepared. Sure, I\u2019ve been impressed\
  \ with the grandeur of many a cathedral in my lifetime, but this was beyond the\
  \ scope of my imagination. We happened to enter the church on a Sunday when Mass\
  \ was being conducted. The interior was filled with an atmosphere of reverence,\
  \ but casual revenue as is practiced in Italy. I looked up and was struck. The ceilings\
  \ and walls were covered in gold. Faces, figures, flora, and fauna abounded. The\
  \ entire ceiling dazzled as the windows lit up with light. Tiny mosaics made up\
  \ intricate scenes that stretched across every inch of the enormous nave.\n\nLooking\
  \ up I marvel at these biblical stories from a completely secular point of view\
  \ and yet I can\u2019t help but think that this is probably the closest I\u2019\
  ll ever get to heaven. My mind wanders from the time of Christ to the time of construction\
  \ and I think back to all the manpower, wealth, and devotion it took to create such\
  \ a structure. Surely there was a master plan, a grand scheme, a larger story when\
  \ it came to this mosaic making. But in this intricacy, these stretches of stories,\
  \ history, faith, power and riches, I saw one thing: simplicity. All of this was\
  \ created by single hands making simple moves, one tiny tile at a time, to create\
  \ this elaborate vision. \n\nAs we live our everyday lives, we become immersed in\
  \ the complexity of our surroundings, the logistics required to make the world go\
  \ round: to get to our jobs on time, to make sure our loved ones are cared for,\
  \ to pay bills, make plans, eat out and eat well and accumulate things. We constantly\
  \ look forward, trying to build a future that is safe and stable, and at the same\
  \ time beautiful. We do this for ourselves and hopefully for those who come after\
  \ us. And in contemplating this big picture, this grand scheme, we sometimes forget\
  \ the very movements, the precious small steps, that we need to take make sure our\
  \ big picture is built the way we want."
