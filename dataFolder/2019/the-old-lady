Text: "In the minute we got there, my eyes were captured by the image of that small\
  \ house, surrounded by flowers and a small fence to protect that delicate world\
  \ from the invasion of tourists that use to domain the place during the summer.\
  \ Fortunately, it was the end of winter. \nCabo Polonio was the last spot of a road\
  \ trip that I took with my friends through Uruguay. There were so few people there\
  \ that our first impression was that we had come to an abandoned place. But soon\
  \ we realized that we were in one of those places that seem empty at first sight,\
  \ but are full of secrets that come out when they finally understand what people\
  \ are doing there by that time \u2013 when they should be by themselves. \nIf I\
  \ close my eyes right now, I can feel that cold air bringing the smell of the sealions,\
  \ hear to the sea warning us to not get so close and, of course, be watched by the\
  \ empty summer houses that rest under that mysterious sky. \nAfter we left the truck\
  \ that brought us till there, we walked along the main unpaved street, trying to\
  \ guess what would happen in each of those bars and cafes during the high season.\
  \ But I did not want to see that \u2013 despite the trouble we had to find places\
  \ to have dinner or tea. The only thing that I was wondering was if the few time\
  \ we would have there would be enough to enjoy all that silence. That was when I\
  \ saw the house. \nIt was in the garden of the hostel that we were going to stay,\
  \ facing the beach. Not very high, with small wooden and glass windows, a small\
  \ chimney and a garden around it. It seemed that any minute an old lady would go\
  \ out of it and ask who we were and what we were doing there. \nI usually know when\
  \ a house wants to tell something. It's just the same when you look at someone and\
  \ you feel in that right minute that you know that person. I knew that house. But\
  \ why that one?\nCabo was full of other empty houses \u2013 and legends of strange\
  \ things that happen when they don't have guests. Along the beach, we even found\
  \ one that made us feel invited to rest on the balcony, watching the sea. At night\
  \ that same house that seemed empty during the day hosted a candle light dinner\
  \ \u2013 that we watched (a bit frightened) from the beach. But that one was different\
  \ and I could not stop looking at it. \nSo, the day we left, I actually saw an old\
  \ lady getting outside the house. It was our host. When she saw me, she smiled:\
  \ :\n_Do you like the house? \n_Very much. \nShe smiled again. She also like a lot\
  \ that house. That was the first place she lived when she moved there  with her\
  \ husband. He was a fisherman, and the children they have had were born in the house,\
  \ when Cabo Polonio not even dreamt about having those agitated summers. There was\
  \ just the fishermen families, the lighthouse and the sea.\nYears later, when they\
  \ moved near the beach and built a new house and the hostel, she couldn't leave\
  \ the old house behind. So the fishermen helped her to bring it to the new yard.\n\
  Now, the children no longer live there and the family doesn't  fish anymore. But\
  \ the lady is still there, taking care of that old house and keeping it alive as\
  \ if it was a person, that looks at the visitors asking them to discover who \"\
  she\" is \u2013 because she was there when everything begun."
