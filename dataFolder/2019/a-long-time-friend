Text: "Ten years ago, a colleague friend of mine named Helen travelled abroad unexpectedly\
  \ during our High School days. She didn't finished her final year before she left\
  \ as a result of the sudden opportunity. No one in my class knew the continent she\
  \ went to. I finished my High School and still never heard from her. Her elder Sister\
  \ and brother had graduated before she left, so, I couldn't find anyone to ask of\
  \ her whereabouts. But, I kept her picture in my memory hoping that I  will meet\
  \ her soon. She was beautiful inside out, genuine in dealings and very approachable.\
  \ \n\nWell, I couldn't find her for over two years and I obviously missed her. Though,\
  \ I never allowed that to weigh me down so I continued with my academic pursuit\
  \ and dreams. I obtained an admission to study Civil engineering in a Polytechnic.\
  \ Though, I was still spreading my antenna in search for her. I finally graduated\
  \ as a Civil engineering technologist and immediately went for a compulsory one\
  \ year service - National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). I  got a state award. Even\
  \ though I got a state award on the Computer Laboratory I executed. Nothing was\
  \ so sticking as the insight I drew from thinking of her friendship behavior one\
  \ day as I was thinking during my thinking time within the service year. The insight\
  \ I got that day eventually became a written book titled -\"A Genuine Friend\".\
  \ The book reveals that \"not all friends are friends indeed\". Also, the insight\
  \ I drew from thinking of her friendship brought about my definition of a friend\
  \ thus, \" a friend is a person whose right attitude projects genuine love in sharing\
  \ ideas, in conversations and sharing of gifts\". I really drew a positive behavior\
  \ from her, hence, the reason why her picture kept coming to my mind all the time.\
  \ In this case, \"out of sight is out of mind\" was never a reality. The mementoes\
  \ of her friendship behavior was very high in my mind. Today, this book is a blockbuster.\
  \ \nActually, it was approximately seven years I left High School but that notwithstanding,\
  \ her memories was getting more refreshing due to the insight I drew thinking of\
  \ her and has already been made into a book. As a generational thinker, I never\
  \ stopped penning down inspired ideas, the insight I drew from her was heavily maximized\
  \ which had also given birth to one of the most recently written books titled \"\
  The Order of Choice Making\". She is my role model. \n\nRecently, I began a serious\
  \ search for her implored all the available social media platforms and couldn't\
  \ find her perhaps, she was using a different name that wasn't know to me. I spent\
  \ another three years without any trace of her. At this point, I lost interest in\
  \ search for her. So, I discontinued my search for her. Suddenly, an opportunity\
  \ came. I was invited to a Youth Empowerment Programme in Canada. I quickly made\
  \ all necessary plans to attend. I got the airport and arrived in Winnipeg of Manitoba\
  \ province safely. We were taken to a Hotel where the organizers of the programme\
  \ have booked for us. I went straight into the Reception and behold a good looking,\
  \ gorgeous and long time friend Helen was the receptionist.\n\nFinally, we exchange\
  \ pleasantries and contact details excitedly. She personally allocated my room to\
  \ me. I couldn't believe my eyes and I almost thought I was dreaming. It was a miracle\
  \ indeed. Althrough my stay in Canada, she ensured I  enjoyed it beyond my imagination.\
  \  I was really amazed I have found her. I didn't expect to find."
