Text: "Culture shock hits me right in the face as we drive passed the roads of Mirpur\
  \ in our white car.  Looking at what Kashmir is well known for, I admire the fresh\
  \ breeze flowing from the tall grey mountains, with a hint of greenery from the\
  \ grass and lilies blossoming from the ground.  I ask my uncle to stop the car next\
  \ to a colourful bangle stall; \n\u201CRed, purple or yellow, what colour should\
  \ I choose.\u201D \nI think to myself.  \n\u201CBuy the red bangles; they will look\
  \ nice on your fair arms beta.\u201D \nI agree with my uncle and parallel with his\
  \ choice. As we drive to the main city, I notice a lot of small stalls selling vibrant\
  \ shawls and glass home decoration.\nSometimes simplicity is the best. Coming from\
  \ the big city London, I realized that everyone lives for their selves indulged\
  \ in their busy routine. Kashmir, on the other hand, is a community where everyone\
  \ works together. The man constructs the item and the woman markets it; with the\
  \ profit made, they then feed their children.  This is truly beautiful and the essence\
  \ of Kashmir.\nUpon arriving in the city, my uncle asks me to cover my head with\
  \ a scarf. I hear the afternoon pray being read.  Hearing the devotion of the priest\
  \ reading the Adhan, reminds me of how prepossessing Islam is and how easily you\
  \ can forget your roots while living in a western country.\nAlthough the city is\
  \ surrounded by mountains, it has also been modernised by showrooms like Toyota\
  \ and international petrol stations such as BP. The most popular Pakistani brands\
  \ such as Khaadi, or Alkaram are accessible in Mirpur, alongside may more designer\
  \ brands.  I now fully comprehend why Mirpur was given the title of mini London\
  \ by BBC. It is a city refurbished and essentially mimicking the same setting as\
  \ London. The city was developed by people who migrated to England years ago, like\
  \ my grandparents. They left the country and provided to their families in Pakistan\
  \ to open businesses. The country grew eventually and became a western outlet.\n\
  My uncle takes us into a jewellery shop which is surrounded by striking colours\
  \ of bangles. I beam and walk towards the wall of bangles hung up as d\xE9cor. \n\
  \u201CWhich colour would you like to try on madam? We have different shades of each\
  \ colour. For example, pink. We have; fuchsia, rouge, magenta?\u201D \n  The retailer\
  \ then points towards the other side of the bangles.\n\u201COr would you like to\
  \ go for the shade of blue? We have indigo, or would you like navy?\u201D\nI softly\
  \ greet him and let him know that I am just looking for now.\n\u201CMadam, did you\
  \ get those bangles from the small stalls on the way here?\u201D \nHe suggested\
  \ with a grin on his face.\nI lift up my arm up and show him,\n\u201CYes, I did.\
  \ They are very pretty! \u201C\nHe rolls his eyes back and replies saying,\n\u201C\
  They are glass bangles made with cheap colouring. You should have come here first\
  \ as we could have given you much better quality bangles. This shop is known to\
  \ be one of the best bangle shops in Mirpur as every foreigner comes to us to buy\
  \ their jewellery!\u201D\nIt abruptly made me realise how materialistic we ought\
  \ to become.\n\u201CI am sorry but I disagree with you!  In these bangles, I see\
  \ love and effort that has been made by a mother. In these bangles, I see a father\
  \ who has been standing outside in the forty-five degrees Celsius to Fahrenheit\
  \ heat trying to sell them to make a living. They are not as fortunate as high-end\
  \ brands to be supplied with better quality material.  They are, therefore, working\
  \ with minimal supplies.  I personally think that is admirable. Coming to Pakistan\
  \ and seeing a family striving so hard to overcome poverty has made my experience\
  \ surreal. I am proud of my roots! This is how my grandparents accomplished their\
  \ success; they worked hard in the United Kingdom to provide us with a better future.\u201D\
  \nThe storekeeper smiled towards me and informed me how I made an excellent point\
  \ and appreciated hearing an intellectual and heartfelt opinion."
