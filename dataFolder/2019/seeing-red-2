Text: "One month has passed and tomorrow my flyed pack to Buenos Aires is leaving\
  \ from Lima.\nI\u2019ve seen beautiful places, people and how beautiful the world\
  \ could be. I nearly could cry when I think about the moment sitting in the plain\
  \ to BA. Luke\u2019s saying to me: \u201Cbut you\u2019re not going back to Germany,\
  \ you are going to agentina! Could be worth or not?\u201D  Cause nearly half of\
  \ my family lives in Buenos Aires, going back was Form me like going home. \nI packed\
  \ my stuff, the bus is leaving in 40 minutes and I am walking 20min to the bus station.\
  \ \n\u201CBye Luke, see you!\u201D \nWell everything was fine. I gaved to the \n\
  employer my ticket and then.... I think it is one of the worst things that could\
  \ happen to a backpacker ... could find my passport.\nI have cleared my whole backpack,\
  \ bot nothing.\nCalled Luke, he started to search in our hostel room but also nothing.\
  \ 20min left, I run back I a speed I think I\u2019ve never runed. Found nothing....\
  \ \nThan Luke runed back with me... he tucked my dayback... and what was in his\
  \ hands.... in the one my red dayback, in the other my red passport.\nWhat a stupid\
  \ girl I could be haha...\n\nDuring these 20 minutes I was seeing red... \nand my\
  \ thounghs were: \nNoooo all my stamps."
