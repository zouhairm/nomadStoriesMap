Text: "Greece is a name of dream to me & when I got the opportunity to visit this\
  \ oldest country, I felt myself super lucky. I\u2019m a student of philosophy, so\
  \ that I studied numerous of philosophical thoughts belongs to Greece . When I was\
  \ planning for my trip to this country, I thought Greek culture, history, traditions,\
  \ were might be known to me very well . I had no idea that I was totally wrong.\
  \ Philosophy taught me a lot of Greek theories but they are Really not represents\
  \ the country as well . \n\nSo when I put down my first step to the Greek earth\
  \ I understood how unknown the country for me . I got overwhelmed with the tropical\
  \ weather, combination of natural view with ancient architecture, and amazing hospitality\
  \ provided by unknown pedestrian. \n\nI planned to visit two important cities of\
  \ the country, first is the capital called Athens & another is the trade city named\
  \ Patras.\n\nI liked Athens because it\u2019s the centre of arts , politics, learnings\
  \  & philosophy. It is the city from where philosophy was arised . A young boy named\
  \ Thales was curious about this world and asked a question that\n\n \u201C what\
  \ is the first ingredient of the world? \u201C\n\nBy this question, people was about\
  \ to think of this fact and before this, there were nobody to think of that . It\
  \ was just starting, then time passed and respectively there arised Socrates, Plato\
  \ , Aristotle, Alexander and many more . \n\nAthens is the home of Plato\u2019s\
  \ Academia, Aristotle\u2019s Lyceum and finally the birthplace of democracy. I new\
  \ these things before, but I didn\u2019t knew that all these history and cultures\
  \ were destroyed in several times and Athens survived plethora of decades to recollect\
  \ its historical resources and cultur . \nWhen I visited Acropolis, the main attraction\
  \ of Athens, I got opportunity to know some real issues organised by Pericles, the\
  \ founder of democracy. I got chance to read some paper book provided by the Acropolis\
  \ museum and I felt myself a real witness of war between Romans and Greek peoples.\
  \ \nAncient stone theatre, Odeon of Herodes attracted me so well and for some moment\
  \ I thought  there were standing Aristotle spreading knowledge ! \nThe Parthenon\
  \ was so sensitive as it was broken for so many times but that half devastated structure\
  \ was standing with pride ! The most interesting thing for me was to enjoy the full\
  \ view of Athens from the zenith of hill. I felt I was in a time machine and got\
  \ back to the ancient period . Funny part is , I would not want me to come back\
  \ from that fantasy. \n\nBut I had to come back and pack my back to visit my next\
  \ destination. Patras , third largest city of the country was located at the Ionian\
  \ Sea. The city contains some breathtaking views I couldn\u2019t forget ever . Beaches\
  \ which are located to the west of Patras like lakkopetra , gianniskari, are warm\
  \ sandy beaches with shallow turquoise coloured water . Though I have never seen\
  \ any Caribbean beach in reality, I watched pictures, videos and heard from my friends,\
  \ I felt Patras beaches are closely seem to the Caribbean beaches. \n\nThe water\
  \ is so transparent so that I could see some underwater plants and fishes easily.\
  \ Not only this , I enjoyed a sunrise and sunset from my balcony. The sunset was\
  \ so beautiful that I would like to watch this again sitting on the beach. So next\
  \ day I went to the beach, enjoyed sunset and luckily I got to know about the night\
  \ beauty of Patras . As I have no plan to spend evening at the beach but I was grateful\
  \ because I did that . It was totally surprising to me to observe the night view.\
  \ Fortunately I got full moon and found some restaurants just besides the beach.\
  \ It might two or three feet in distance between beach and restaurant. I enjoyed\
  \ dinner in a restaurant where  my surroundings was decorated by moonlight and tide\
  \ were came across to my feet , wets me a little so that I could get some divine\
  \ feelings . \n\nThus a little portion of my travel story in where I think Through\
  \ a time machine I just jumped into the unknown ."
