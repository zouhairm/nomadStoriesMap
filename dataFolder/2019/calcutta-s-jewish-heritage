Text: "On a summer afternoon, Samir left home to take a stroll to get a glimpse into\
  \ the Jewish heritage of Calcutta. From his house at Park Street, he walked along\
  \ the JL Nehru Road to reach and took a right turn near the Grand Hotel the New\
  \ Market. Once inside he visited the century old Jewish bakery Nahoums to try the\
  \ black forest cake and Jewish samosa. The shop still had the old charm, with the\
  \ glass showcases and the cashier\u2019s table being the same that the Shop\u2019\
  s founder Israel Nahoum used in the early 20th century. During Christmas, the shop\
  \ becomes a syncretic place, thronged by Hindus to buy cakes made by Muslim bakers\
  \ to celebrate the Christian festival. It being one of the most iconic bakeries\
  \ in the city, was as usual thronged by many foreigners. \nSamir, being an introvert\
  \ ignored them and left the shop. Again, he started walking along the road towards\
  \ the Jewish Synagogues of Calcutta. On reaching the Central Avenue, Samir took\
  \ a right turn to take the Canning Street to reach his destination. The Canning\
  \ Street houses the Bargee Market, one of the busiest markets of the city. Hence\
  \ the street always remains crowded with different kinds of people. The pavements\
  \ on both sides lined with makeshift stalls selling all kinds of articles ranging\
  \ from stationaries to electronics, clothes, utensils, etc. Shopkeepers shouting\
  \ at the top their voices to attract customers and customers bargaining with the\
  \ shop owners for a favorable deal. The atmosphere was stuffy with the Summer heat\
  \ and all the noises.\n    When Samir reached the intersection of Canning Street\
  \ and Rabindra Sarani, suddenly it started to drizzle. In front he could see the\
  \ highspire of the Magen David synagogue, and on his right side were the white marble\
  \ domes of Nakhoda Masjid, the largest mosque of Calcutta. He felt as if the Synagogue\
  \ was attracting him and went towards it. As he went ahead, the drizzle subsided,\
  \ and again sunrays fell on his head. In the sky he could see a faint rainbow. The\
  \ gate of the synagogue was well hidden by makeshift stalls. Samir had to make his\
  \ way through the congested stalls to find the gate. On entering the compound of\
  \ the synagogue, he saw a board of the Archaeological Survey of India stating some\
  \ information about the place. \nSamir then met the caretaker of the synagogue,\
  \ Ahmed, who acted as his guide. All the synagogues in India are looked after by\
  \ Muslims, due to the similarity between Kosher and Halal norms. A fact that may\
  \ be strange for any other person, but quite normal for Indians. Ahmed opened the\
  \ giant wooden doors and switched on all the lights and handed over a black cap\
  \ to Samir. Samir wore the cap and stepped inside the synagogue. He was mesmerized\
  \ by the grandeur of the interior. Sunrays crept in through the stained-glass windows,\
  \ creating a play of colors on the marble floor. At the center on the ground floor,\
  \ there was a place from where the rabbi read out the Torah. On both sides there\
  \ were wooden benches and chairs arranged in coupes, each one for each family. \
  \ At one end of the synagogue, there was the place for Jewish God, with the depiction\
  \ of the night sky on top and two plates with the Ten commandments in Hebrew. Samir\
  \ then went to the first floor by accessing the wooden stairs. The same arrangement\
  \ of benches was repeated in the second floor. There were chandeliers on the roof,\
  \ that were now lighted with LED bulbs instead for candles. There were iron railings\
  \ inlaid with gold along the sides of the first floor. After seeing the synagogue,\
  \ Samir left for his house.\nOn reaching his house, he made an entry into his diary\
  \ about the day\u2019s events. He was very delighted on being able to see and explore\
  \ the Magen David Synagogue, the largest Synagogue of Asia. Altogether, Samir felt\
  \ very happy at being able to explore a little part of the Jewish past of his city.\
  \ He pledged to visit it again along with his friends and family."
