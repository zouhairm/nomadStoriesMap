Text: "It was the middle of witners in north India. I was in Manali the heart of mountain\
  \ lovers. The journey from Delhi to Manali can show you two face of the country.\
  \ One hand you have the metro city where there is people, cars, traffic, pollution\
  \ and nothing else than that, where as on the outskirts of delhi you can find the\
  \ villages where they didn\u2019t even cared much about the city. During the journey\
  \ as we entered the hills there we could see the cultural differences between the\
  \ city people or the \u201Cnichhe vale log\u201D as called by the localites there.\
  \ They didn\u2019t bother who you are what you have how do you look, talk, they\
  \ just know that you\u2019re there guest and they have to take utmost care of you.\
  \ I reached Manali early in the morning at 5:00, and you can\u2019t believe that\
  \ people there were so active in these early winter mornings. Everyone had woken\
  \ up and we\u2019re onto their daily routines. \nI only knew 1 person in Manali\
  \ and he was the local man who was head for our company\u2019s local seeing\u2019\
  s. I reached the hotel and found that no one is there and everyone has left for\
  \ the trek. I had no chance other than to wait till evening when they return. After\
  \ having my breakfast, the local person helping with the company work asked me if\
  \ I wished to go out to city or somewhere other then sitting in room. My answer\
  \ was obviously yes!! I got ready for the day ahead and we took off on the bike.\
  \ \nI must tell you, it was the best bike ride of my life! The drives past the valleys,\
  \ hair pin turns, the winter breeze, everything was like one moment you get adventure\
  \ the other moment the sense of relaxation from life down in the cities. \nSo after\
  \ almost driving for half an hour we reached a place where we used to take our groceries\
  \ for the trekking camps. After completing with the work there we headed out to\
  \ our advanced base camp site to check on how the arrangements have been done at\
  \ the starting point. So again traveling for about and hour we reached the destination.\
  \ From there you can see the whole Manali lying under the foots of the mountain.\
  \ It almost got evening by the time we reached our hotel but during the journey\
  \ way back to hotel I could see Manali city changing its colours. From timid ligts\
  \ to bright red lights of cars stuck over for bypass. \nThat night I had no thoughts,\
  \ complaints, issues with what my life is going through. That night I met with the\
  \ other team members of our local team and I was so happy to be there as for the\
  \ next 35 days I will have the chance to be with these wonderful bunch of people.\
  \ During these days I had the pleasure to visit each and every members house, meet\
  \ their family, village people. I also had the chance to celebrate the local festivals\
  \ with them. I remember it was my last week there and there was this festival called\
  \ SAAJA where it is celebrated to mark the change of sun position. As it changes\
  \ it\u2019s position it signalfor the change in season. On this day people visit\
  \ to each others places and have khichadi with ghee and chaas! And also on this\
  \ occasion a lot of charity is done across the valley. They donate food in temples,\
  \ to the needy and it is also seen that people keep their doors open all the day\
  \ welcoming anyone to have khichadi and chaas. This is thier way to let everyone\
  \ be happy that day and make sure that no one sleeps hungry. You feel the enthusiasm\
  \ amongst the locals about this day. On the contrary the local people were so bonded\
  \ with me that they took me with them everywhere and also at one moment they tried\
  \ to marry me with one of the locals so that I could stay over here with them all\
  \ the time. \nTill day I remember those 35 days which went away so fast."
