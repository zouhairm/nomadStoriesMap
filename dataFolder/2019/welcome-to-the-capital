Text: "The visa was stamped onto a piece of paper affixed to my passport. Lefkosa,\
  \ the inverse, the twin, the upending of Nicosia, Cyprus. One city, two capitals.\
  \ The ease and simplicity of moving through Nicosia to enter the unknown of Lefkosa\
  \ was stunning. Yet on the other side of the ruddy, laughing guards shouting \"\
  Ho\u015Fgeldiniz\" or \"welcome\" in Turkish language to our straggle of scholars\
  \ was the sober realisation of a city divided. The political implications were far\
  \ from the good-natured, back-slapping appearances that security kept up.\n\nAnd\
  \ on entering the gates we were awash in a sense of rundown-ness, tempered by the\
  \ vibrant orange trees that never fail to cheer flagging spirits. I sipped a cup\
  \ of kahve, sloshing delicately porcelain cup in a tiny streetside caf\xE9 with\
  \ two rickety tables outside, and the owner insisted I let her read the grounds\
  \ to predict my fortune that day. I didn't mind, but neither could I gauge what\
  \ her frenzied gesturing meant. \n\nI was reading a paper at an international conference\
  \ hosted at the university in Nicosia, and the organiser was accompanying us on\
  \ a brief tour of structures in both parts of the city that have housed churches\
  \ and mosques. This was punctuated with jokes and commentary on translation--and\
  \ its beauties and difficulties--in this seemingly unthreatening island city with\
  \ its architecture of light and sun, its jaunty beach music, its fresh, airy, tomato-laden\
  \ food. \n\nBut the tomatoes, what bullets of tomatoes! Biting into their crisp\
  \ flesh atop steaming bread straight out of the oven, I was hesitatingly pushed\
  \ into my innkeeper's memories of the civil war between Greek and Turkish Cypriots\
  \ that rent Nicosia apart in the fifties. \"This lane, yes, this lane, my father's\
  \ house, this gate right outside, here, here, almost inside the breakfast room,\
  \ the blood came this far!\" she agitatedly flounced about the small garden in her\
  \ floral dress, her fifteen-year-old daughter blas\xE9 in micro shorts and a cropped\
  \ top. \"Shall I add you on Facebook?\" she demanded. \n\nOn a visit to Lefkosa\
  \ the next day--the previous afternoon spent in a haze of cherries and fruit liqueour\
  \ tasting in diminutive villages in the Troodos mountains--a family, conference\
  \ presenters as well, gave me company in a taxi. Passing in a vehicle through security\
  \ seemed far less adventurous, but the sights were rewarding in a different way.\
  \ Miles of nothingness and the hot sun, cornrows, bundles of hay in fields and an\
  \ occasional, perplexing immense hotel or fancy construction. We were headed to\
  \ the seaside. \n\nThe inviting water was lined with ghost apartments, for the people\
  \ had left long ago--as our driver-guide told us--from homes where televisions had\
  \ been left running, food rotting on kitchen tables, milk curdling in half-open\
  \ refrigerators. We lunched in a homely restaurant where the cooks offered to roast\
  \ a leg of lamb for our group, dressing it in a flavourful mint sauce and its own\
  \ juices. Bleached by the bright sun and fatigued by the heat, I could peck only\
  \ fitfully at a plateful of saffron rice and vegetables. \n\nTo imagine the struggles\
  \ that have intermittently rent the coast, or even the threat of it, was, to my\
  \ mind, a sacrilege. But isn't this what affects us, post the time of battle or\
  \ scrimmage-the need  to control the light that a place emits? instead of enhancing\
  \ the delights of a splendid indigo sea rife with marvellous tints, we have a half\
  \ and half: barbed wire and cockiness, beautiful safety and patches of fertile land\
  \ asserting their right to bloom. The brilliant red bushes along the highway stand\
  \ witness."
