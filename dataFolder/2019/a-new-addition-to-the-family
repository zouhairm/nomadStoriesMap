Text: "\"Hai!...lo siento, s\xED! uno cerveza por favor!' I had just arrived on a\
  \ muggy late afternoon in July to a tapas restaurant in Shibuya, Tokyo. Mixing up\
  \ Spanish and my limited Japanese was a common theme for this day as I was seated\
  \ at the bar in front of the kitchen. I was speaking to the owner, an older Japanese\
  \ woman who had lived in Spain and spoke with the familiar Castilian accent in which\
  \ every \"s\" and \"z\" sound was pronounced with a \"th\". Either way, my Japanese-speaking\
  \ ability on my first trip to Japan was very poor, so having the ability to speak\
  \ a little bit of Spanish at least made me feel a little bit more worldly. Myself,\
  \ being of Filipino descent and Asian in appearance, I had found myself the object\
  \ of curiosity by a Japanese couple right next to me. While we had politely smiled\
  \ at each other for several minutes, we had yet to actually exchange words. \n\n\
  Unexpectedly, one of the chefs in front of me behind the kitchen had sent me a plate\
  \ of champi\xF1ones rellenos, or stuffed mushrooms. The chef then gestured to the\
  \ couple right next to me, who had smiled and waved politely. That order of tapas\
  \ was courtesy of them! I had come to find out the name of my new best friend in\
  \ Japan would be Yukihiro, a happy bespectacled man with a hearty laugh, and his\
  \ girlfriend at the time, Hina. I had sent them the next round of red wine and we\
  \ spent the next several hours speaking to each other in a mix of my limited Japanese\
  \ and their limited English. However, I had my trusty iPad with me and phonetically\
  \ wrote everything they were saying in Japanese and I learned a lot of Japanese\
  \ that night and used it for the rest of my trip. \n\nWe had parted ways that evening,\
  \ though I kept in touch with Yukihiro sporadically over social media. When the\
  \ stars aligned, I was able to return to Japan and reconnect with my old friend\
  \ in his city of Hiratsuka, in Kanagawa prefecture, about an hour away from Tokyo.\
  \ My friend was now newly married and with a baby on the way. He and his wife, Nao,\
  \ were kind enough to drive me around throughout the town of Hakone and take me\
  \ to a Summer Tanabata festival(annual star festival) in Hiratsuka to wrap up the\
  \ humid, July night. Yukihiro and I realized that neither of us had really improved\
  \ mastery of each other's respective languages, but for some reason, it was never\
  \ felt unnatural or awkward. Yuki was using a translator app and while there were\
  \ a few times the translations did not make sense due to the vast differences between\
  \ Japanese and English, one thing translated perfectly on his app summed everything\
  \ up; \"I do not know why, but it feels like we are brothers, even if we do not\
  \ always understand each other.\" \n\nI had taken the last train just after midnight\
  \ to make it back to Tokyo, unsure when I would see my friends again. The next day,\
  \ around 1:00pm, I had received a text message from Yuki and Nao; a picture of them\
  \ and their newborn daughter, Rio. In that message, they wrote that they felt I\
  \ had a connection to them and their baby in some way, since I had visited them\
  \ the day before. Almost one year later, I had returned to visit them to finally\
  \ meet the baby, Rio. Nao had introduced me to her cousin, Maki, a college student\
  \ majoring in English, a new friend and someone who was there help to fill some\
  \ of the communication gaps. This time around, we had rented a van and embarked\
  \ on a 3-day roadtrip, enjoyed onsen, or hot spring baths, stayed in ryokans, traditional\
  \ l Japanese inns and even hiked under an ice cave! \n\nWhile I have quite a few\
  \ friend in Japan, this connection is really special and is a reason I keep going\
  \ back. This is to me the greatest thing about traveling; connections and happy\
  \ surprises. You may even find yourself a new addition to someone's family!"
