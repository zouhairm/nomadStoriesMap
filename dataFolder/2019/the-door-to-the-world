Text: "With a chance to realize my first experience of living and participating in\
  \ a new culture outside my home country, I did not hesitate to say: yes, I will!\
  \ A lot of people put some words of fear in the way, but i followed my main idea,\
  \ always imagining how incredible it could be.\nThe opportunity came from the university,\
  \ as a student of Architecture and Urbanism. The challenge was to do a semester\
  \ in a Portugal college, in an agreement with the institution in Brazil.\nI always\
  \ had the dream of make a big trip when I would complete 18 years. It was at this\
  \ age that the dream was about to come true. I confess that the fear appeared, the\
  \ sad moment of say goodbye to family and friends it was bad, but the desire to\
  \ know the world was bigger than everything.\nWhen I stepped on Portuguese soil,\
  \ I could see that what would come next would be all outside my comfort zone and\
  \ my reality. Moments later, I found the courage. And it was me. I entered on an\
  \ adventure of 5 months in an unforgettable exchange in the city of Covilh\xE3 -\
  \ Portugal, the country that welcomed me in a unique way.\nBefore your trip, you\
  \ imagine it will be a special experience. But it is difficult to express the true\
  \ feeling, only be there to feel and to experiment to get understand how this experience\
  \ is unique and different. It is like to be a new person, entrain on a new culture,\
  \ living with a new mode, feeling new pleasures, facing new challenges, view the\
  \ life with a new eye. And Portugal contributed to this, your landscapes and your\
  \ culture \"called me\" even more, the residents - a little shy with strangers,\
  \ they passed me security and showed me show a unique love.\nThey are special moments\
  \ like: to receive a good morning when passing by a gentleman (that looks like my\
  \ grandfather) in the street, to speak local slang without even noticing, to participate\
  \ in local culture events, download a playlist of regional songs, feel like an integral\
  \ part of that great family... And all this is part of this process of insertion\
  \ in this new environment.\nThere are negative points that are compensate by the\
  \ good points: stay away from the family, and at the same time form a new family.\
  \ Meet new friends, and have a shoulder of support in the necessary moments. To\
  \ create bonds that can last a lifetime and in my case, strengthen friendships for\
  \ the lifetime.\nI was so accustomed to this place that it welcomed me so well that\
  \ the most difficult thing was to say goodbye. It seems that I was already part\
  \ of that place, what was already my house, my home. But like everything is in your\
  \ time, it's time to return. I came back as a new person, a new Hellen. I came back\
  \ saying \"pois\", because she was already a \"rapariga\".\nI just have to thank\
  \ you and search for more experiences like this. Traveling became a passion, an\
  \ addiction. To know new cultures has become a purpose for my life, and discovering\
  \ the uniqueness of every place and every people has become a blessing.\nI see that\
  \ we are very small in this universe, that the world is open to receive us, that\
  \ we cannot lose the opportunities of life, that everything has its time, that meeting\
  \ new people, make new friends and sharing good moments is a gift, a beautiful and\
  \ big gift. That the beauty of life is in the simple things, and that there is a\
  \ lot of beautiful things around you to know. Thank you Portugal, for giving me\
  \ a pair of wings and the desire to travel the world."
