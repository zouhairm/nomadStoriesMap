Text: "The choice was made just one turn away\nAnd the turn is what we made\nThe road\
  \ was long but we knew\nit was all worth \nwhat was about to come.\n\nThe weather\
  \ was hot\nWe were covered in layers of sweat\nbut we knew it was worth it all\n\
  The marble beauty was worth it all.\n\nWe passed through the road\nwith greens and\
  \ yellow on both sides\nWe passed the road\nthrough winds both cool and warm.\n\n\
  The roads cheered as we passed by\nfluttering its branches \nthe trees waved to\
  \ us\ngood bye.\n\nPeople riding their carts \njust smiled\nWomen with their water\
  \ pots\nLaughed as we blared the rocks\nfrom the 90's \nwe liked.\n\nThe roads passed\
  \ by \nthe sun went down\nWe looked at road\nStill far we thought\nbut giving up\n\
  We never thought.\n\nThe sun rose once again \nour journey too began.\n\nThe sun\
  \ shining brightly upon us\nAnd our destination \nin the pages of history arrived.\n\
  \nThe marble wonder \nThe symbol of true love\nThe despair of a King\nA piece of\
  \ flaunt I call.\n\nThe Taj the Crown\nFor a woman of beauty\nIt was for a King's\
  \ pride.\n\nThe sun reflected its beauty\nthe white bright this afternoon.\nThe\
  \ art on its walls \nis the beauty I saw.\n\nThe show of power I saw\nThe power\
  \ of a King \nThe ruler of everything under the heavens\nThe ruler that tortured\
  \ twenty thousand.\n\nI climb up to see the surroundings\nthat witness this power\
  \ each day\nThe river which bore this beauty\non its banks\nThat flows with the\
  \ grief of many\neach day.\n\nThe half built walls of black\non the side \nof this\
  \ beauty in white.\nIncomplete it may be \nbut saved it has many lives.\n\nThe four\
  \ gates of this mausoleum\nGrand and beautiful as it should be\nfor beauty in marble\n\
  was made for \nthe Wife who was the Favorite.\n\nWe capture the memories we made\n\
  with this beautiful marble memory\nTo never forget this day.\n\nThe sun set I don't\
  \ know when and colored this white\nIn yellow, orange and red.\n\nI wondered how\
  \ much this love could change\nGoing from the pure white\nTo the fiery red \nAnd\
  \ to many more that may come one day\nWhen? I wondered\nWatching its magnificence\n\
  \nIt was time to leave\nAnd as I turned back to look\nat this beauty one more time\n\
  I hear the sigh of the beauty \nforever stuck in this magnificent structure\nI hear\
  \ the mourning\nof the King who still looks.\n\nThe stars appear in the sky\nAnd\
  \ I leave the Taj\nWith its beauty \nforever in my memory.\nI leave the Taj Mahal\n\
  hoping to return one day again."
