Text: "Jouissance\n\n\nThis is the story of a fallen man, of a poet misunderstood\
  \ yet vibrant as can be, a secret genius with a high tendency to make his world\
  \ a lavender of languages from object-orientation. He was, alas, a narrator of his\
  \ own right, with an insidious bond with chemicals of all sorts. He has already\
  \ chosen the evil between the two. \n\nThis is a story of the often drugged out\
  \ man who kept the depths of his mind the greatest secret to behold. This is the\
  \ story of a man who never spoke of his craft as a dialectical materialist because\
  \ existence became a self-proclaimed testimonial conscience in the incubation of\
  \ introversion. \n\nThis is the story of a man who took the deepest breaths in the\
  \ fall of rain, the crystals along edges of the snowfall, the skinny loves.\n\n\
  Meet Mr. Sonata, the \u201Csubject,\u201D quite a friendly engagement worth an extended\
  \ notice at the first glance, wholesome in his approach to extinguishing unholy\
  \ desires, a fine soul in the eyes of the women who praised him, a pseudo-Buddhist,\
  \ a character with a skyscraper nose compromised by the glamour of the metallic\
  \ piercings along both ears and the pink puffed cheeks.\n\nThis is he.\nHe is it.\n\
  Impermanent and forsaken. \nFallen down with so many sinful acts. \n\nHe indeed\
  \ had a full life of poverty thus far. Ruins from the past have shamed into pieces\
  \ against delight but some had it worse than he, he knew that he knew. \n\nSome\
  \ had it with tumors of pride and reliance on the services of others to wherever\
  \ travels gave in abysmal forthcomings. The origin of birth, the mother, a Finnish\
  \ woman of microscopically-stitched clothing always dressed in half-knee dark \u201C\
  professional\u201D clothing turned into a nineties French furniture collector and\
  \ the wealthiest woman on the East coast for her perfected pose, honest pride, and\
  \ downright unattainable intellect grown and fed never by the synthetic drugs the\
  \ university folks use these days, had instilled in him the habit of thinking towards\
  \ simple manners. As a melancholic biochemist and physicist breathing between hotel\
  \ receipts and three sets of sackcloths moving from the world's finest particle\
  \ accelerators known and unknown, above and below ground, simplistic contribution\
  \ was the answer. \n\nOh sure it was, for he knew how to split the \u201Catom\u201D\
  \ into several pieces of observation. This is by no means a joke at all! He would\
  \ have to act as a particle splitter, sterilizing processor, and drug developer\
  \ meanwhile collecting collapsed steel objects and stealing highway parts in due\
  \ time for large pieces of art (to be speculated upon).\n\nSimple was surely the\
  \ answer, quite so, yes, as a van vagabond, a patch of daisies would suit well in\
  \ the evenings. His eyes pierced through into the materialistic piranhas of the\
  \ twentieth century Americans. \n\nBear with him. He ain\u2019t no psycho here.\
  \ Just an expressionist with high pride after graduating one of the most difficult\
  \ universities out there: Cornell University. And soon thereafter making a distinct\
  \ promise to an old business partner to open up shop in a town of wilderness, keep\
  \ the handful of slaves in his mother\u2019s home toward which would be traded with\
  \ him for a good story in the paper on a new drug discovery thereby granting him\
  \ the inevitable entry into fame for the creation of a new psychedelic drug and\
  \ a scientist\u2019s exclusive art piece\n\nMeet the origin, the mother: she called\
  \ herself Lady Q, after the force towards all things unknown. Yes, she questioned\
  \ all phenomena, except herself. Skepticism named her the golden gypsy of town.\
  \ She became such a skeptic she began to ask if her son had reared himself under\
  \ the influence of his own pathologies and thus gave birth to a newfound sadism\
  \ as a consequence. Because he began to act like a foreign one to her. No longer\
  \ had he fulfilled duties towards purchasing extravagant household and clothing\
  \ items, no longer did he seek diamonds to store \"only on display please.\u201D\
  \ Rather he needed electromagnetic forces, batteries, and copper. Laboratories.\
  \ Tools. Microscopy. Explanatory exhibitions of science. Questions. The Aha! moments\
  \ and the the \u201CEureka!\u201D gasps."
