Text: "I have always been fascinated with the idea of traveling, however, except for\
  \ occasional exploring of Ukraine, my homeland, and one awesome trip to Kyrgyzstan\
  \ with my granny, I rarely had chance to see more. I mean, all those travels were\
  \ great but they felt like mere hors d\u2019oeuvre before the main entrance, nice\
  \ but not enough to fully saturate my desire. Money was one of the main obstacles\
  \ for me. My family just couldn\u2019t afford frequent trips within Ukraine, let\
  \ alone somewhere beyond. \n  Last summer, having finished my first year at university,\
  \ I was entirely committed to start \u201Cthe Journey\u201D. Although I didn\u2019\
  t improve my financial situation much, being of full age, I could consider a nomadic\
  \ style of traveling, which wouldn\u2019t have been allowed by my parents before.\
  \ And on hearing a lot of stories about hitchhiking experiences, I got really excited\
  \ to recreate something similar. \n  I found a like-minded friend with the same\
  \ passion and together we hit the road in the mid July. The whole journey took us\
  \ 21 days and cost about 150 euro per person. Heck of the trip it was, to retell\
  \ everything at once would be very complicated, but I will try to present you a\
  \ vivid picture of what we experienced back then.\n  \u201CJumping into the unknown\u201D\
  \ is one of the major benefits of this journey, far more important than money expenditure\
  \ or convenience. I doubt that I had ever felt more independent than during that\
  \ tour. You have no idea of what will happen tomorrow, no planned itinerary or scheduled\
  \ hotels; but you have all the time in the world to live through tiny moments along\
  \ the way and opportunity to narrate your own adventure. To bring things even further\
  \ we decided to use the internet as little as possible and rely only upon the conversations\
  \ with strangers.  It gave us a perspective of an old-fashioned traveler, when no\
  \ precise maps or guides had been available, and each step towards the destination\
  \ had been spanned by mystery. So many times we stumbled across some stunning building,\
  \ street or view, and the pleasure of a discovery multiplied even more because we\
  \ hadn\u2019t had any specific expectation about it.\n  Talks with folk were priceless.\
  \ I found it amusing how easy it was to open your soul before someone you had met\
  \ a moment ago. It takes some practice, but then a great deal of opportunities will\
  \ open in front of you. I had many profound dialogues with people of different age\
  \ and perspective; such experiences definitely shape your own perception of the\
  \ world and dump your doubts, encumbrances and fears as for connection with others.\
  \ Also the number of people striving to aid us with food, shelter for a night and\
  \ valuable pieces of advice was insane; we found constant support everywhere.  Afterwards\
  \ you really start to sense this unfathomable nexus of all human beings, our strong\
  \ bondage, - this was absolutely wonderful.\n  Another obvious advantage of every\
  \ travel is to behold historical sites, famous constructions or some beautiful places\
  \ made by nature. We were awed by delicate streets of Vienna and Venice, mind-blowing\
  \ views in Salzburg, and the gigantic powerful Alps, to name but a few. In addition,\
  \ hitchhiking will demonstrate you how one country and its culture slowly turns\
  \ into another one through small details here and there: various languages, versatile\
  \ architectural patterns, climate changes and so on. This diversity was unbelievable,\
  \ so many peculiar differences, customs and spirits, but it wasn\u2019t alien to\
  \ each other, somehow it all felt so familiar. \u201CGlobal village\u201D, I heard\
  \ once such an expression, and it is true, despite all distances between states\
  \ and our distinctions we are but same.\n   All in all, people were telling me that\
  \ the insane idea of going into the \u201Cunknown\u201D without plans, enough money\
  \ and experience would hurt me. They were wrong. That \u201Cunknown\u201D wasn\u2019\
  t frightening at all; instead it welcomed to discover it. Contemplated travels are\
  \ great, but they diminish the pleasure of being constantly surprised by little\
  \ things. Thus, I encourage everyone out there, who wants to immerse into captivating\
  \ adventure, to try a hitchhiking trip or take a spontaneous leap somewhere unknown\
  \ for you."
