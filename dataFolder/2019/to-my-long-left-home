Text: "I\u2019ve always considered home to be a place where you carve a space out\
  \ for yourself. Home isn\u2019t always just a space of stability, it\u2019s a place\
  \ where you learn, you change, you blossom into someone who is simultaneously the\
  \ present you and the future you. I found my first home in Winchester, England and\
  \ recently I returned to re-emphasise my local connections.\n\nI returned to Winchester\
  \ on a crisp February morning, feeling lost. Having not lived there for three years,\
  \ I was homesick, and reverting back to past behaviours, just wanted to feel like\
  \ the past me of years ago, full of optimism and promise. \n\nThe minute I walked\
  \ out of the train station I knew I was home. Re-treading lost footprints, I meandered\
  \ into the town, discovering new treasures in the military quarter. Due to Winchester\u2019\
  s historic prominence, many military units have links with the city, and there is\
  \ a large complex of military museums, including the hidden gem of the Gurkha Museum.\
  \ Speaking briefly to the museum curator, I was fascinated to learn how the Nepalese\
  \ community in Winchester were so proud of this museum, and considered the museum\
  \ to be a huge part of their local heritage.\n\nAfter leaving the Gurkha Museum,\
  \ I found myself drawn to the Great Hall. Walking around the large hall, watching\
  \ the Round Table hang imposingly above me, it seemed like I could almost see a\
  \ younger me with her friends, whispering excitedly about the myths and legends\
  \ and history contained in that room. \n\nThe rest of the day was dedicated to remembering\
  \ my old haunts. Waving at the man who runs the Ciabatta Grill food stall on the\
  \ high street I meandered down the high street, enjoying one of the almost daily\
  \ markets I used to love visiting, looking at stalls and talking to people I hadn\u2019\
  t for years. I frequented my favourite shops, making sure to pick up treats for\
  \ people that they hadn\u2019t had in years, and being sad that the best craft shop\
  \ I had ever been to had finally lost its battle against Hobbycraft. My day ended\
  \ in front of Winchester Cathedral, looking up at this beautiful structure and remembering\
  \ the times I picnicked in the park outside the Cathedral on summer days with friends,\
  \ the Christmas market I always took my family to, and the time in my third year\
  \ I actually worked up the nerve to climb the Cathedral tower. I almost saw myself\
  \ graduating, and walking out the large red Cathedral doors that all graduates of\
  \ the University of Winchester walk out of. I could feel the robes around me and\
  \ the bite of the October air as I mentally recreated my class throwing our hats\
  \ in the air, along with our tutor throwing his imaginary hat. Mostly, I remembered\
  \ my first visit to Winchester, a successful Open Day that ended with my parents\
  \ and I eating ice cream and watching the Paralympics on a giant screen placed next\
  \ to the Cathedral. Just like how there is always at least one cat asleep in the\
  \ middle of St James\u2019s Terrace, this had always been and always will be my\
  \ home, even then.\n\nBefore leaving the city, I made sure to sit on the Buttercross,\
  \ the way I did every September the day before university, and every May before\
  \ leaving for my childhood home. Allegedly, you are cursed to return to Winchester\
  \ if you sit on the Buttercross. In my eyes, a curse is a small price to pay to\
  \ be guaranteed to return to this fantastic city. Returning only emphasised how\
  \ dear this place is to me, and Winchester will always be a home to me."
