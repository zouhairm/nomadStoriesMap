Text: "The Bucharest train leaves packed from Vienna at six in the evening. Twenty-two\
  \ hours later, it's bound to reach its destination. For the past three days, Emma\
  \ and I have travelled over two thousand miles, coming home from Scotland. This\
  \ last leg is expected to be the most challenging one.\n\nMost of my past experiences\
  \ with the CFR [Romanian Railways] were troublesome. The ticket-purchasing system\
  \ is terrible and people trying to cheat it can cause issues. To my surprise, this\
  \ wasn't going to be that type of journey.\n\nOn such a long trip, one has time\
  \ to think. Six years ago, when I left home, I only had one guiding thought: I wanted\
  \ to run away from the crooked system, from corruption and the mandatory bribes,\
  \ and from all the bad habits inherited from the notorious communist lifestyle.\
  \ I didn't care where I'm heading, I just wanted to move away from it. So naturally\
  \ I'm always a bit scared when returning home from living abroad as I always experience\
  \ a few days of cultural shock.\n\nYet the atmosphere on this train is different\
  \ from my expectations. People are sharing food and stories. A strong sense of dor\
  \ (longing) fills the air. I sit quiet, listening to music and trying to read while\
  \ Emma is forcing herself to sleep.\n\nCrossing the border is a painstaking process.\
  \ It takes longer to travel between two villages in Hungary and Romania than the\
  \ entire Eurostar journey from London to Bruxelles. At around 4 in the morning,\
  \ we are finally in Arad. Most people are asleep. The air is thick with a cold summer\
  \ fog and the sun is shyly coming up.\n\nAs expected, Nasul (the ticket inspector)\
  \ walks in. Everyone shows him their tickets and I'm surprised of how well he knows\
  \ the Interrail system. He moves on and I go back to my napping attempt. Down the\
  \ corridor, I hear him complaining about people not having tickets. At first, I\
  \ sigh: \"here we go again.\"\n\nBut then I hear someone speaking in English, trying\
  \ to translate something Nasul said. The latter is trying to extort few hundreds\
  \ lei (around two hundred euros) from three passengers. To my surprise, they are\
  \ travelling with Interrail from Asia. In a typical Romanian Border Control manner,\
  \ Police took their tickets to do a check and never returned them. Nasul adamantly\
  \ demands the tickets value paid in full.\n\nYet the pressure increases from others\
  \ defending the Indian tourists. But Nasul knows his rights: the Interrail system\
  \ requires the physical ticket carried at all times. The only problem is that he\u2019\
  s cheeky enough to use this to his advantage and ask them all their euros as he\
  \ \u201Chas to exchange it for a poor rate.\u201D\n\nPeople are angry. For the first\
  \ time, I see Romanians uniting against an act of petty corruption. I'm ashamed\
  \ of the system that made Nasul the kind of person he is now. I can read he\u2019\
  s an honest employee. But I know that he and thousands like him doing everything\
  \ \u2018by the book\u2019 are part of the problem.\n\nIn a country with 3.6 million\
  \ people having left for a better world, the ones that you don\u2019t see are the\
  \ reason we\u2019re living so far from our loved ones. People like Nasul, asking\
  \ for too many euros despite me showing him the exchange rate, are here to remind\
  \ us the Romanian system is still deeply corrupt.\n\nI negotiate the amount with\
  \ him on behalf of the puzzled tourists. He ends up taking the hundred euro note\
  \ and cutting three tickets, visibly upset that he couldn't have it his way. I apologise\
  \ to the visitors on behalf of Romanians. My apology is well drafted, I have used\
  \ it many times before.\n \nAfter arriving home, I share this story with everybody.\
  \ I am not proud of it, but I have hope. Myself, together with everyone who tries\
  \ to improve the system, will eventually change the minds of people like Nasul.\
  \ They will no longer be invisible, hiding behind rules and status quos. So hopefully\
  \ one day, we\u2019ll be able to return home for good."
