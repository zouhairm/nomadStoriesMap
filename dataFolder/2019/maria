Text: "I took a sip of the thick, bright juice. My nose wrinkled. It was heavy with\
  \ pulp, something I hadn\u2019t yet gotten used to. I preferred the cans of fizzy\
  \ Fanta that were in almost every restaurant and market; it was the first time my\
  \ mom had let me drink so much soda. The chipas were too dry to eat on their own\
  \ though, and I needed the hearty bread to ease my motion sickness. Even with the\
  \ pulp, the cool juice was refreshing in the sticky, mid-morning heat. Our driver\
  \ chatted with the chipa vendor and the two passed a guampa gourd of terer\xE9 between\
  \ them, sucking the cold, bitter tea through a silver bombilla straw. \n\nWe were\
  \ two hours into a bumpy three-hour drive to visit Maria and her family and we were\
  \ running late. Recent flooding had made the unpaved Paraguayan roads even slower\
  \ than usual so they took us directly to the school - one long, low building split\
  \ into classrooms. \n\nAs we walked up the steps nearly a hundred children and teachers\
  \ started clapping. We were seated at the center of a semicircle and spent the next\
  \ hour watching their performance of traditional song and dance, including the famous\
  \ bottle dance I so desperately wanted to learn. We toured the school, the principal\
  \ proudly showing us the desks and lavatory our modest sponsorship had provided.\
  \ Our guide explained that we were only the second foreigners to visit the community\
  \ and the first hadn\u2019t spoken any Spanish. \n\nI peered out from behind my\
  \ mom and looked at the faces of the children trailing behind us; their big brown\
  \ eyes, dark hair, and tan skin so similar to mine. I looked up at my mom. My adoption\
  \ wasn\u2019t a secret, but I\u2019d rarely noticed our mismatched features before:\
  \ her chestnut curls, freckled skin, and light blue eyes. Suddenly, she seemed almost\
  \ exotic in the sea of brown skin, South American lilts, and red dirt. \n\nNext,\
  \ we went to Maria\u2019s home: two dirt-floored rooms joined by a covered common\
  \ space and an open-air cooking fire towards the back. Chickens clucked and pecked\
  \ around a swath of shrubby bushes. The cooking fire crackled. Maria\u2019s mother\
  \ was a smiling, round-faced woman, her wide feet and plastic sandals both covered\
  \ in a permanent dusting of red earth. Conversation flowed as easily as it could\
  \ with an interpreter; though Paraguay is a bilingual country, its citizens speaking\
  \ both Spanish and the indigenous Guaran\xED, in Maria\u2019s community, Guaran\xED\
  \ was more common. \n\nFlanked by sisters, cousins, and neighbors, we were shown\
  \ the new water pump, the newborn piglets, and then, tucked carefully in a corner\
  \ of their home, a neatly stacked pile: all the letters, photos, books, and toys\
  \ we\u2019d ever sent to Maria. As the afternoon wore on Maria\u2019s mother and\
  \ mine fell into a comfortable version of conversation as Maria\u2019s mother began\
  \ bringing pots and platters to the table. The entire neighborhood had pitched in\
  \ with dishes and ingredients to prepare a feast; thick bor\xED bor\xED stew, fresh-off-the-fire\
  \ chipas, and dense sopa paraguaya cornbread among others. \n\nWe ate. \n\nWhat\
  \ I knew then, even at nine years old, was that the only barrier between Maria\u2019\
  s life and mine was chance. She was a sister in another life. The version where\
  \ I had not been adopted, where my mom shared my blood and my thoughts found voice\
  \ in a bilingual tumble of Spanish and Guaran\xED. My world could have been the\
  \ dusty paths between school, the water pump, and an earthen-floored home filled\
  \ with the smell of simmering bor\xED bor\xED. Instead, my blue-eyed mom and I said\
  \ our goodbyes, my mom and Maria\u2019s embracing with tears in their eyes, and\
  \ Maria and I exchanging shy smiles before we climbed back into the dusty pick-up\
  \ to start the jostling drive back to Asunci\xF3n. \n\nTwo days later we flew home\
  \ to California. Home was just as we\u2019d left it, but something felt different.\
  \ The wooden floors were too shiny, the boxed juice too smooth, and though my mom\
  \ was still my mom, I studied my face in the bathroom mirror and wondered about\
  \ a woman 6000 miles away whose eyes maybe crinkled like mine when she smiled."
