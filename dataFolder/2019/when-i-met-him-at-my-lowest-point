Text: "Any travel becomes a lot easier when we connect with somebody during that journey.\
  \ A little help can become a good conversation but a memorable connection is possible\
  \ if we do something for one another in that small interaction.\n\nIt was a time\
  \ of February 2019,I was returning to London from India after attending my sister\u2019\
  s five days giant wedding. I was extremely tired and sleep deprived because of the\
  \ change in the time zone and endless travelling. It was morning 4.30 am, my friend\
  \ came to drop me after seven hours of drive to give me nice and warm see off as\
  \ the return to my country was expected no sooner. I was in the queue for my boarding\
  \ pass and after waving the last goodbye to my friend through the glass wall, I\
  \ immediately snapped into the zone of loneliness.It wasn\u2019t a good feeling\
  \ I was missing my people, out of sadness I kept my head over my hand that was holding\
  \ the handle of my luggage and I took few steps in that same position. Suddenly,\
  \ a guy standing ahead of me started talking \u201CAre you ok? You look tired. I\
  \ pulled myself up and replied \u201CYes I am \u201C. We spoke a little until we\
  \ reached to our boarding pass counters. Time went by with the immigration and security\
  \ check; we finally saw each other after boarding the flight.\n\nAs the journey\
  \ was of 13 hours with one stop at Bahrain, I went off to sleep because of my tiredness\
  \ and I woke up at after the flight landed to Bahrain. I met Nitesh once again he\
  \ was sitting opposite to me but far too ahead which is why the conversation was\
  \ happening on top of our voices. I noticed people were watching us, they were smiling\
  \ and laughing while listening to our conversation. I guess Nitesh sensed that too\
  \ as he took everything that he had and came sat next to me. We spoke for three\
  \ hours in that lay over. He told me about his first time visit to India and what\
  \ he did and even said that I was easily noticeable because of my red jacket. By\
  \ this time, we knew about each other profession, schooling, little bit about family\
  \ and friends.  As Nitesh was talking about his childhood days he told me how much\
  \ he enjoyed stealing things from the flights whereas I told him that I could never\
  \ do anything like that because I was too shy to do it.\n\nWhen the boarding started,\
  \ it became very much clear that we both wanted to talk more. As we went inside\
  \ the flight and were given our seats, Nitesh asked me for my seat number and I\
  \ saw him talking to the airhostess but nothing worked. My eyes were also hovering\
  \ for him as I was enjoying his company. Since nothing worked so all through out\
  \ our journey we were exchanging our looks and smiles to each other. Upon arriving\
  \ to our finally destination I had to take Non-EU lane for immigration while I was\
  \ following the lane suddenly I could hear my name, at first it was not that audible\
  \ but it became louder thereafter I was about to turn around and check, Nitesh jumped\
  \ right in front of me. He said \u201CPuja,I have got something for you\u201D. I\
  \ was wondering what is he saying but before I could ask something he pull the bag\
  \ from his shoulder unzipped the chain and takes out the headphone from within.\
  \ He gave those headphones to me saying \u201DSince you have never stolen anything\
  \ in your life, I wanted to do it for you\u201D .He left after saying that and I\
  \ was smiling wondering how crazy he was.\n\nAfter the immigration, I went to claim\
  \ my baggage. I looked all around for him but there was hardly any people left.\
  \ As my luggage was approaching, I saw him coming from the other side. He took his\
  \ place next to me and was waiting until I had all my bags with me and then he escort\
  \ me to the bus stop and from there we departed after exchanging our numbers with\
  \ each other."
