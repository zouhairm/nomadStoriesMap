Text: "One fine day, I found myself waiting for the bus at Baker St in Central London\
  \ on my way to Standsted airport once again. This trip to Venice, Italy was very\
  \ significant because it had been my dream to visit Italy for many years. Being\
  \ that my ancestry is rooted in Italy, I felt very connected to this journey I was\
  \ about to embark on. After taking the \u2018express\u2019 bus for five Euros, I\
  \ found myself at the Piazzale Roma bus station unsure of how to find my hostel\
  \ and worried about the percentage of people who spoke English. My Italian was more\
  \ than rusty! And, even if I could ask a question properly in Italian, no one would\
  \ speak slowly enough for me to translate the answer into English. \n\nThe central\
  \ area was surrounded by overpriced water taxis/buses, I decided to buy a map and\
  \ find the hostel because that\u2019s the spirit of a true traveler! Soon after\
  \ crossing one of just four main bridges on the Venice Grande Canal, I was amazed\
  \ by the picturesque views of Venice and traditional Italian bakeries, supermarkets,\
  \ gelaterias (ice cream bars), and osterias (wine bars). Immediately, I knew how\
  \ most of my money would be spent. I classify myself as \u2018foodie\u2019 and if\
  \ that wasn\u2019t enough; the window displays of scrumptious baked goods, gelato,\
  \ and other Italian favorites would lure me in anyway. Prior to taste testing the\
  \ entire city of Venice, I had to ignore the sweet distractions and locate my hostel.\n\
  \nAs soon as I checked into the hostel, I was off to cover the grounds of Venice.\
  \ The next three days were utilized to the fullest to be able to cover the entire\
  \ city of Venice. Strolling through the residential villages and climbing mini bridges\
  \ to cross the inner canals, I was in awe of this city. Every corner you turn is\
  \ a photographic moment and it seems that the scene reflects that of an oil painting.\
  \ No wonder why I found numerous painters spread out in Venice capturing the exterior\
  \ of Venice and selling their artworks on the streets.  Everywhere I wandered, the\
  \ gondola rowers were shouting at tourists to go for a ride on the canal. It was\
  \ so comical when the gondoliers yelled \u201Cgondole, gondole\u201D. I tried not\
  \ to speak in English when I was passing them or else I was an easy target or potential\
  \ \u2018customer\u2019. \n\nEventually, I settled for a canal ride on one of the\
  \ many large water boats and started the passageway at Piazzale Roma (the beginning\
  \ of the Grand Canal) and ended at the stop called Giardino (gardens). The last\
  \ stop happened to be this natural park with such greenery, which cannot be found\
  \ in the more touristic area of Venice. I had landed in the residential district\
  \ and it was lovely to see a less traveled place in Venice. The boat ride on the\
  \ canal was like a dream. It was completely breathtaking and it felt like I was\
  \ floating on the ocean absorbing the waterfront sights of the city. This was probably\
  \ the most memorable time in Venice and of course a dream come true.\n\n\nThe true\
  \ beauty of Venice (other than the cuisine and culture) is that you don\u2019t need\
  \ to follow a guidebook to have an adventure. I covered the inner city, residential,\
  \ and outskirts of Venice within three days and didn\u2019t miss a main street or\
  \ bridge for that matter. The culture in Venice was magnificent and the Italians\
  \ were as I had imagined them. They were warm and carefree. The lifestyle was so\
  \ inspiring and amusing to witness people who were living in the moment and not\
  \ so affected by the outside world. It was a bubble in Venice, a comforting place\
  \ that was a home away from home. It was so fantastic to see Italians living in\
  \ their environment and this was my greatest experience to date!"
