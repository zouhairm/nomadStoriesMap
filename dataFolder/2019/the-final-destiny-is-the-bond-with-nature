Text: "The path to Casa no Tempo is a sensory gradient, at least that\u2019s how I\
  \ feel it. I start to see the city on my review mirror, as the houses, the people\
  \ and the noise fade away behind me\u2026\n\n I was welcomed by Domingos, the farm\
  \ keeper - his warmth made me feel like we knew each other since forever. Leaving\
  \ the one street village behind, all I have in front of me is the countryside. \n\
  \nInstantly, I put the radio on mute, so I can appreciate everything around me,\
  \ in silence. The balancing trees, the muddy paths, the small brook that runs so\
  \ strong, thanks to the rain that still falls. The small goats that suddenly appear\
  \ on the road, didn\u2019t catch me by surprise: they are as inherent as the imposing\
  \ rocks along the field, as if they were supposed to be there, and I was already\
  \ expecting them. \n\nAt last, through all this intense but quiet path, I catch\
  \ a glimpse of the house from afar, on the top of the hill. It is different from\
  \ everything around it, but so natural that seems raised from the ground, as any\
  \ other tree of the property.\n\nWhen I arrived, and got out of the car, a silence\
  \ fell upon me, and I could finally listen. I could hear the birds singing through\
  \ the rain, the water of the swimming pool moving with the wind, as well as the\
  \ tree leaves dancing, far away. If I closed my eyes, I could see everything, even\
  \ better. \n\nThe visual silence around showed me nature\u2019s beauty and power,\
  \ as the rain welcomed me and introduced me to the house. Once inside, I easily\
  \ understood: Casa no Tempo honors nature, memory and time.\n\nThe beauty of Casa\
  \ no Tempo is that the house is not made only by the building itself, but rather\
  \ by what surrounds it, and the interaction between these parts. The house is an\
  \ ovation to nature, and makes sure that its elements are always felt, both in and\
  \ outdoors. \n\nThe raw wooden furniture, the framed landscape on a big window,\
  \ the natural clay floor underneath my feet, make me feel so connected with nature\
  \ as if I was hiking in the woods. Moreover, there isn\u2019t any room in the house\
  \ where nature doesn\u2019t enter through the large opening windows, as if they\
  \ were paintings, decorating the room: the interiors\u2019 simplicity allows nature\
  \ to be the leading figure of this experience.\n\nBut memory is also celebrated\
  \ within this walls, as the key ingredient that strengths the ties between architecture,\
  \ people and surroundings. \n\nMemory, in a sense that I see the men who re-did\
  \ these walls: the wavy marks they left on them tell me their own story. \n\nMemory,\
  \ in the way architecture reinvents a house typology, and elevates it through form,\
  \ materiality and construction details.\n\nMemory, because my mind brings me home\
  \ when I\u2019m here, although I have never been here before, and this doesn\u2019\
  t look like my house. But this warmth, that comes from within, gives me comfort\
  \ to be barefoot, to lay down on the sofa, to be happy because there is a storm\
  \ outside.\n\nTempo means time, but also weather. I like to think that the sense\
  \ in it relies on the timelessness of the experience, when your life takes a break\
  \ and you dive into this unbelievable and breathtaking universe. \n\nMoreover, Casa\
  \ no Tempo is the happiness and fullness feeling you have at this place, where the\
  \ seasons pass through you and you can\u2019t help but feel like an element of nature,\
  \ an element of the landscape."
