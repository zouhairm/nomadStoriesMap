Text: "The climb was intense and demanding but the landscape rewarding at each turn,\
  \ we pass through forests covered in ashes by a recent eruption of the volcano,\
  \ we are passed by a group of girls on Harley Davidson that probably came out straight\
  \ from a manga. We are at the top, we see the caldera from below, besides us is\
  \ a vast grassland, closed by fences but with an open gate, inside a few dozen cattle\
  \ are chewing grass. The view from there is astonishing, the terrain just perfect,\
  \ \u201Cwhat a camping spot\u201D we think, and we pitch our tent, at the peak of\
  \ happiness.\n\nIn the night, while camping in this beautiful spot on mt. Aso (the\
  \ biggest and most active volcano in Kyushu) we ear some heavy steps and grunts\
  \ and whispers very close to our tent, we think it must be a wild boar, we wait\
  \ but it doesn\u2019t go away. So armed with our TiGr Lock we go outside just to\
  \ find out it is a cattle. We shout at him but he seems not to care, anyway we feel\
  \ relieved, it\u2019s just a cow by the way. But it stays by the tent all night,\
  \ sometimes pushing with head and horns on it, quite scaring.\n\nWe go out two times\
  \ again but it doesn\u2019t seem a normal cattle, it\u2019s threatening, its eyes\
  \ are red and it looks on the verge of attacking me. Its horns are huge, we never\
  \ thought about how easily a cattle can turn into a bull, just a matter of perception.\
  \ We can\u2019t sleep. In the morning one of Elena shoes is disappeared and the\
  \ cattle is not in sight\u2026 it is then that we found some little mushrooms that\
  \ look like hallucinatory psilocybe, could be a cattle in a psychedelic trip?!\n\
  \nAfter a little while it\u2019s back, again threatening, smelling our bags and\
  \ looking at us with a freaky expression, at the end we go away and it follows us,\
  \ almost charging\u2026 we run away, scared by a cow, and without a shoe."
