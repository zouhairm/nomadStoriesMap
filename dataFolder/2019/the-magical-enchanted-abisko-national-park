Text: "The train arrived into Abisko STF late afternoon in October. Usually you'd\
  \ find a lot of snow and very chilly temperatures but this wasn't a usual time.\
  \ The temperature was a tolerable 15\xB0C. \nThe skyline was expansive and reached\
  \ from mountain top to mountaintop with a dash of waterfalls and a massive lake\
  \ silently sitting in the middle of the mountains spanning from Norway into Abisko\
  \ and on to Finland. The variations of rocks, trees and water were quite deep and\
  \ mystical. This was a magical Arctic experience with so much in store for us we'd\
  \ no clue what we were in for.\nOur first night we booked a Northern Lights photo\
  \ tour and from the moment we stepped out the door we were gifted with the magic\
  \ of Aurora. There was glowing green and swirls if reds and purple dancing as if\
  \ a CGI expert was painting the sky with a Hollywood experience. My mouth hung open\
  \ in awe of this truly magical experience being painted in front of us and this\
  \ was just in the car park!\nWe arrived to our photographing spot and you could\
  \ hear this powerful waterfall off in the distance. The immensity of its noise was\
  \ truly calling out that this was a very big waterfall. The backdrop for our Aurora\
  \ viewing was amazing. The glow of the Aurora was lifting up the valley in green\
  \ and giving an incredible show.\n\"The Abisko Bluehole is why\", our photographer\
  \ instructor told us. You see there is a weather phenomenon where the mountains\
  \ placed as they are create the perfect area to have a higher success rate of seeing\
  \ the Northern Lights. 86% of the time people have success viewing the Northern\
  \ Lights in Abisko and this is because the ocean winds from Norway create a flow\
  \ that pushes clouds from over Abisko to the surrounding areas and there is then\
  \ a hole in the cloudy sky. This is called the Abisko Bluehole. People come from\
  \ all over the world to view them here and I could see why on just my first of 6\
  \ nights there.\nWe stayed up until 3 am in awe of these beautiful light shows that\
  \ had no care for our need to sleep, it was the perfect show. This lady, Aurora,\
  \ sure knew how to entertain but she never slept and you'll never hear me complain.\
  \ My travel group was 3 ladies and we all had a love of photography as well as,\
  \ the Northern Lights. One of them said at 3 am, \"I never thought I could get sick\
  \ of seeing them but it seems I'm too tired to continue on!\" We all laughed as\
  \ we had only just arrived that afternoon so it's no wonder we were tired from travelling\
  \ so far and soldiering on thru the night to appease our love of Aurora.\nThe morning\
  \ came quickly but we had a great cabin and we had shipped for food so we were ready\
  \ to cook breakfast. The day was plotted out for hiking, which Abisko has multiple\
  \ trails to adventure through. \nWe all seemed to have a jolt of energy to get up\
  \ and out so off we went. We hiked up above the village and got expansive views\
  \ of the park, the lake and the mountain range. Everywhere I looked it was as if\
  \ there were little features in the wood, watching us and attempting to camouflage\
  \ themselves before we could capture a glimpse or even a photo of them. \nThe sense\
  \ of this location was a feeling of old medievil times. We felt like dragons should\
  \ be flying around and magical wizards walking about. We settled for a pack of Sami\
  \ reindeer that were grazing along and the sound of their bells as they moved. What\
  \ a site they were. There was about 15 of them and they were very prestigious looking.\n\
  The magic of this park is 24 hours. I can't explain it but everywhere we turned\
  \ there was something special to witness. The area is full of things to do. You\
  \ can't be bored here as there is so much to experience from daytime to night time,\
  \ you won't be disappointed at all."
