Text: "Flying into Rome Flumico Airport after 21 hours of travel, I was really excited\
  \ for one thing... COFFEE.\n\nI got through the airport fairly easily with only\
  \ one moment of confusion, needing to take a bus to get to baggage claim. With no\
  \ signage, I was lucky to find an English speaker to help me out and stop me from\
  \ doing laps of the airport.\n\nWith my baggage in hand, feeling exhausted and jet\
  \ lagged I headed for the one thing that could make me feel better; Coffee.\n\n\
  The cafe was run by Italian speakers, I walked up to the counter said latte and\
  \ paid 1:30 Euros. I was amazed by the price. I waited a few minutes and was very\
  \ surprised to be handed a hot milk. Turns out latte means milk in Italian, probably\
  \ should have learnt some phrases before I left \U0001F602\n\nToo awkward to fix\
  \ my mistake I drank my hot milk and left.\n\nThe rest of the day went quickly.\
  \ I met my fellow travellers, and was amazed that I'm the only Australian and the\
  \ youngest. By the time we made it to the hotel and checked in, I had already gained\
  \ some lovely new friends.\n\nFirst wander threw Viterbo was disappointing. My hotel\
  \ roomate and I went exploring while others napped, we headed down when in hindsight\
  \ we should of gone up. We saw a dodgy downtown area with no Italian charm, it was\
  \ confusing: is this really where we are staying?\n\nWe returned to the hotel and\
  \ slept for maybe 4 or 5 hours, only waking up for a free dinner provided by the\
  \ University.\n\nOur guides directed us up the street this time, through 11th to\
  \ 12th century medieval walls. This is where we found the real Viterbo. Cobblestone\
  \ streets, fresh produce markets, and every building being a historic building.\
  \ Exactly what I had pictured when I decide to live in Italy.\n\nOur dinner was\
  \ a 3 hour, 3 course meal.\n\nFirst course: Antipasto. Olives, Fresh salami, fresh\
  \ cheese, bread with olive oil, roasted zucchini and eggplant\n\nMain Course: 3\
  \ kinds of Pizza. Mushroom, margarita, and salami with olives. Beautiful crispy\
  \ pizza bases, perfectly balanced sauce and cheese.\n\nDesert: Tiramisu\n\nSuch\
  \ a spectacular dinner in the heart of Viterbo started my trip with a bang.\n\n\
  After dinner a small group us students toured the best nightlife areas in Viterbo.\
  \ It was a scientific expedition to know where to go out in our new home.\n\nUpdate\
  \ I've been living here a week, and  I've managed to order a take away coffee today.\
  \ I'm very proud of myself for not getting just hot milk. Life is all about these\
  \ small victories.\n\nThe order:\nCaff\xE8 con latte - coffee and milk\nA Portar\
  \ Via - to go\n\n\uFFFC"
