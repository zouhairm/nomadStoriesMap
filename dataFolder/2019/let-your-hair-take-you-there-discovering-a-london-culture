Text: "On my 37th day in the rain soaked city of London, I awoke to the loud, summer\
  \ rain beating against my hostel window. My first month\u2019s stay in the city\
  \ had been carefully planned down to the second in an effort to get the full tourist\
  \ experience. I saw every site listed in my guidebook. I crossed the iconic Abbey\
  \ Road; I investigated the truth behind the mystery of\_\u202A\u202A221B Baker Street\u202C\
  \u202C; I even grabbed a drink at the George in honor of Shakespeare. Although interesting,\
  \ I hadn\u2019t yet felt a deep connection to the space.\n\nAs I made my way to\
  \ the restroom of my hostel to get ready for another activity-packed day, I looked\
  \ into the mirror and gasped with a sudden realization. My meticulously planned\
  \ adventure de jour would need to be postponed because it\u2019d been over two months\
  \ since I\u2019d last redone my hair. Small, resilient afro tufts had managed to\
  \ slip from escape the captivity of their impressively neat plats, and now celebrated\
  \ their freedom at the edges of my hairline. It was time to get my hair done.\n\n\
  After wrapping up my hair in a distractingly, vibrant head wrap, I phoned a friend\
  \ who\u2019d been living in the UK for some time and inquired about the best places\
  \ to have my hair re-braided. After taking down a list of three of the supposed\
  \ best salons in London, I set off on my quest for a more perfectly quaffed 'do.\n\
  I traveled to three different boroughs in search of these salons, and at each I\
  \ was met the same dilemma: they were unfamiliar with handling or styling Black\
  \ hair textures. Feeling a bit irritated, I hoped on the tube, deciding to head\
  \ home and try again on a different day. Apparently, in my frustration I didn\u2019\
  t pay much attention, and boarded the wrong train! To make matters worse, my phone\
  \ died, concealing within it my directions home. As I exited the station, I found\
  \ myself smack dab in the middle of the Brixton borough, one of the few that I had\
  \ not visited. In an effort to calm myself down, I took a walk around the block.\
  \ While attempting to navigate my way back to the station, I encountered a smell\
  \ so alluring and familiar, that I stopped dead in my tracks.\n\nFollowing my nose,\
  \ I found myself standing in front of a brightly colored Jamaican restaurant called\
  \ Negril. After taking a seat in their outdoor patio area, I was approached by a\
  \ woman who introduced herself as Alvita. She stated that she would be taking care\
  \ of me for the evening and asked if I had any questions regarding the menu. After\
  \ taking my order (oxtail stew and a side of plantains\u2026yum!) she sauntered\
  \ back towards the kitchen to submit my order. Believing that most of our conversation\
  \ was now completed, I leaned back and closed my eyes for what I was told be a 'short\
  \ minute' until my food arrived. Moments later I heard a polite \u201Cexcuse me,\"\
  \ and opened my eyes to see Alvita smiling in front of me once again. After asking\
  \ me where I\u2019m from and the nature of my trip to London, we began to discuss\
  \ the city and the sights. Now comfortable, she took a seat across from me, clearly\
  \ enjoying the lack of customers in the restaurant, and began telling me of the\
  \ hidden gems of the city. Before I knew it she\u2019d made me a list of everything\
  \ from Jazz bars to reggae concerts, all of which were steeped in the culture and\
  \ history of the many immigrants that make London what it is today. What\u2019s\
  \ more, after hearing about my unsuccessful quest for a braiding salon, she also\
  \ referred me to her cousin\u2019s shop where she promised they could \u201Chandle\
  \ hair like ours.\u201D\n\nDue to a hair emergency and my apparent inability to\
  \ pay attention when I\u2019m frustrated, I was granted a look into the London not\
  \ featured in my airport purchased guidebook. Thanks to Alvita, I was able to get\
  \ my hair braided into the neatest and least expensive braids that I\u2019ve had\
  \ since. While getting my hair done, her cousin introduced me to a whole shop of\
  \ London immigrants, each eager to paint a picture of their culture in full technicolor.\
  \ This experience has shaped my understand of what it means to experience a culture\
  \ through the eyes of the folks that it belongs to. During this memorable trip,\
  \ I followed my hair to some of the most meaningful experiences and lasting relationships\
  \ that left my impression of London far different then the way it began."
