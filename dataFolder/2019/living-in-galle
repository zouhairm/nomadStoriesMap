Text: "As a cockerel sounds at the break of day and murmurs of morning prayer float\
  \ through the warm, sticky air from the mosque, I wake up and fling open the front\
  \ door of my sandy yellow bungalow. Each morning, I see mischievous monkeys swing\
  \ through the tropical canopy above and I hear the distant song of Beethoven\u2019\
  s Fur Elise, played from the bakery van that rolls through the neighbourhood. As\
  \ he pulls around the corner, I run out, waving ten rupees for some sweet, fresh\
  \ buns. I\u2019ve been living in beautiful Galle Town for just over a month, teaching\
  \ English in an extra tuition school called\_English and More.\_I feel so blessed\
  \ to be here as not only do I help enhance the English skills of adorable local\
  \ children, but I\u2019m fully immersed in Sri Lanka's\_fascinating, compelling\
  \ and captivating culture. \n\nGalle is mostly famous for its Fort; a Unesco World\
  \ Heritage Site boasting bold, white Dutch-colonial buildings. The charming streets\
  \ are decorated with plush boutiques, lavish jewellers and luxurious guesthouses.\
  \ During the day, tourists and locals soak in the Fort\u2019s history, by wandering\
  \ around it\u2019s ruined walls and admiring its treasures like the Lighthouse.\
  \ At night hundreds gather to cast their eyes over the mesmerising sunset across\
  \ the vast, enchanting Indian ocean. Like statues, they watch in awe from the Fort\u2019\
  s walls. On a clear evening, this is my favourite thing to do. At night, the Fort\
  \ light\u2019s up, making it the perfect spot for a romantic dinner, although most\
  \ restaurants charge extravagant prices in comparison to the rest of Galle.\n\n\
  Drift further out of Galle Fort to experience real Sri Lanka. Kottu is less than\
  \ a pound, Holy cows meander through Galles myriad of hooting and beeping transport\
  \ vehicles, often bringing traffic to a halt and the town is painted in vibrant\
  \ colour; lush tropics surround pink, yellow and turquoise houses.\n\nSerenity and\
  \ calmness are juxtaposed with hectic hustle and bustle. Right behind the pristine\
  \ Dewata Beach lies Galle's dirty main road and a man riding a rusty bicycle cycles\
  \ leisurely alongside the cities chaotic, weaving traffic. These stark contrasts\
  \ are peppered all over Galle; at the traffic lights, a shiny car pulls up next\
  \ to a man riding a wagon pulled by oxen. This captivates me. \n\nThe locals are\
  \ friendly, apart from the odd seedy tuc driver who can\u2019t resist cat calling\
  \ whilst cruising past. Across the street, children and ladies wave bashfully while\
  \ an older man wanders past grinning, barefoot and wrapped in a checked sarong.\_\
  \n\nDewata Beach is the best of Galle; a sublime bay lined with surf shacks and\
  \ bending coconut palms. Merely saying Dewata evokes a feeling and mood of pure\
  \ tropical paradise. During my time off, I enjoy soaking in Dewata\u2019s beauty\
  \ and ambience, book in one hand and a creamy coconut in the other.  Surfers ride\
  \ the waves and the ocean glistens and dazzles around them, it\u2019s truly bliss.\
  \ As the sun melts into the ocean, the sky above Dewata explodes with whirling pattern\
  \ and magnificent colour. It\u2019s my favourite spot in the world. \n\nIt\u2019\
  s on Dewata where I unexpectedly and impulsively fell deeply in love. I admired\
  \ his surf and the way he elegantly swooped forward his head and flicked back is\
  \ long, sun-kissed hair as he rode to the shore. As our eyes met, it was instantaneously\
  \ destined that I\u2019d return to divine Dewata again."
