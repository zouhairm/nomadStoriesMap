Text: "I had arrived in Berlin from the northern Scandinavian countries, in contrast,\
  \ I see the dirtiest city in my trip to Europe so far. With no intention, I landed\
  \ right next to the East-side Gallery; the largest part of the remaining Wall in\
  \ the middle of Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain districts. Yes! I landed right where\
  \ I wanted to be: in the epicenter of modern bohemian culture. \n\nBerlin is both\
  \ unpredictable and unique. The sound of sirens going off around the clock, the\
  \ long knives cutting meat-kebabs at every corner, the fresh smell of graffiti paint\
  \ cans, the underground scene with the most eccentric people creates a density in\
  \ the air that is both wild and vibrant. \nI can tell this city has inspired the\
  \ story line of movies like Mad Max since it is easy to unleash your imagination\
  \ just by walking through the city. Anything you can imagine can happen here, and\
  \ much more I am sure.\n\nI have met my friend Vesta through Couchsurfing and she\
  \ introduce me to a group of locals, we went to Madame Claude bar for some live\
  \ experimental music; the place was on the basement of an old residential building\
  \ that has survived the war, the price to get in was on a donation base, so after\
  \ a couple of euros we were going down the stairs, inside I noticed couches, tables,\
  \ chairs and an old black and white TV set, all attach to the ceiling, the place\
  \ was upside down. I asked myself where the live music is. Well, after a little\
  \ digging around, towards the back of the bar there was this metal door that I assume\
  \ it was meant to protect the people inside from bombs coming out of the sky during\
  \ the war years. I opened the heavy door and there was a cave room with people sitting\
  \ in transition and intense focus towards the playing DJ, science glass tubes with\
  \ flames right next to the mixing table. Since there was not a back door nor emergency\
  \ exit I stay as close as possible to the metal door just in case. This place was\
  \ surreal, it really doesn\u2019t exist where I come from. After some drinks, we\
  \ headed out for some fresh air and ended up at one my new friends flat; Bernard,\
  \ a Swiss filmmaker that moved to Berlin in the 1990s, the night turned into a philosophical\
  \ conversation till early hours. \n\nBesides the people and the bohemian side of\
  \ the city, I was impressed by the history of the place, Berlin has survived two\
  \ world wars and as told by my free walking tour guide \u201Dfrom the Nazis Holocaust\
  \ till this day an average five bombs are found in the city each year\u201D. I have\
  \ tried to visit every important building and location. My visit to Sachsenhausen\
  \ was one of those things that makes you question humankind and brought questions\
  \ like where are we going? Is there any hope? \n\nOn the other hand, The Wall was\
  \ very inspirational. At first, the graffiti is what grabs your attention but after\
  \ learning more about it,  It can become emotional just by sitting right next to\
  \ it; at one point families were divided by a heavy surveillance Wall, now is an\
  \ art gallery that inspires and gives hope. \n\nMy thoughts about Germany were not\
  \ exactly what I have found in Berlin. Germany to me was more like a clean, organize,\
  \ perfect, expensive country. But Berlin showed me a different face of what I\u2019\
  ve told before; a multi-diverse city with locals from different backgrounds and\
  \ different characters that refuse to live an ordinary type of life. \n\nOn my last\
  \ day I was late, so I took a taxi to catch my FlixBus, the driver told me that\
  \ \u201Cthe nicest area of the city was in the west\u201D, occupied by the allies\
  \ at one point after the war. He encouraged me I should visit. I told him that I\
  \ might know how it would look like already and that may be in the future but for\
  \ next time I come to Berlin I wanted to come back to the same place I landed in\
  \ my first visit and go deeper this time."
