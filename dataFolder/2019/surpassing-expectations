Text: "I was 18 years old; fresh out of school, with a yearning to explore the world.\
  \ Having never left Europe before, getting on the coach to the airport, alone, with\
  \ only a backpack as company, was the scariest decision I had ever made at that\
  \ point. Little did I know it would end up being the best month of my life. \nAfter\
  \ three separate (and long) flights, as well as a five-hour taxi ride, I finally\
  \ arrived at the old stable I was to be living in for the month. The walls were\
  \ smothered in messages and drawings from those who had been there before me, which\
  \ gave some comfort to my shaky nerves. After meeting the people I would be staying\
  \ with, and eating some amazing new food, we all set out on our adventure together.\n\
  For a month we hiked up the Andes, got chased back down by bees, crossed rivers\
  \ on thinly placed logs, explored and mapped Incan ruins, macheted through jungles,\
  \ crossed rail tracks over rivers, and rode down the mountains on the roof of the\
  \ van getting absolutely soaked with rain, watched the sun rise over Machu Picchu,\
  \ bartered with locals in Cusco and laughed until our stomachs hurt. My body ached\
  \ daily with the exertion, and I slept soundly every night in the comfort of my\
  \ sleeping bag and mosquito net. Life was good.\nThe most impactful part of the\
  \ whole experience had to be the people we met along the way. The young girl who\
  \ helped me learn Spanish, the crowded group of smiling strangers in a minivan who\
  \ laughed with me as I continuously bumped my head on the roof of the van, the young\
  \ boys at the local primary school we played football with, the old shopkeeper who\
  \ shared beers and jokes with us as well as his fire. On our last night there, he\
  \ called all of us his friends, despite the language barriers and our wobbly Spanish.\n\
  After leaving home terrified and nearly in tears, I left Peru crying that the experience\
  \ was over. To quote Mary Ann Radmacher, \u201CI am not the same, having seen the\
  \ moon shine on the other side of the world\u201D, and this is the quote that I\
  \ used to leave my mark on the walls of that old stable.\nI did not return home\
  \ the same person that I had been, for the better. I learnt to be confident, show\
  \ nerve, to surpass my own perceived limits and to live a little. Although there\
  \ were times where I thought I couldn\u2019t do it, I proved myself wrong each time.\
  \ After keeping a detailed diary for the month, I also discovered my passion for\
  \ writing. \nFrom the people I met, the adventures I threw myself into and the lessons\
  \ I learnt, Peru was a life-changing experience that will stay with me in my heart\
  \ forever."
