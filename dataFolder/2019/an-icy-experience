Text: "As I looked out the small window adjacent to the window seat that had carried\
  \ me across the North Atlantic Ocean for almost three hours, I realized that I was\
  \ moments away from landing in a country that would, perhaps, be the furthest I'd\
  \ ever traveled from my home in eastern Australia.  Iceland's south-western tip\
  \ was within sight, and I was starting to wonder if my family and friends were right...\
  \ it's January 2009, and no one ever goes to Iceland on holidays.  It is so far\
  \ away, and so cold... and there is nothing to do there!  My view of the choppy\
  \ ocean water and an excess of ice weren\u2019t calming my nerves.  I couldn't see\
  \ trees, animals, people, or infrastructure; just lots of grey water and ice.  My\
  \ brain was thinking two thoughts; what the hell am I doing here, and should I hightail\
  \ it out of here on the next flight to anywhere else?  My gut, however, kept reminding\
  \ me that I had spent a fortune to get here and that I had spent said fortune on\
  \ \"stuff\" that I was hoping would entertain me for the next five days.  After\
  \ that, I'd be on my way back home to Australia and the comfort of my everyday life.\
  \  It was time to put my brain to rest and give this experience a go.\n\nWithin\
  \ an hour of leaving the airport, I was walking through the front door of my hotel\
  \ for the next five days, Hotel Reykjavik Centrum.  Although my room was small,\
  \ it was clean and tidy, with a comfortable bed and a view over a public square\
  \ towards Althingi, Iceland\u2019s Parliament House.  The room's heated flooring\
  \ was lovely to walk on when snow could be seen falling outside of my hotel room\
  \ window.  My local neighborhood was full of restaurants and bars.  Tabasco's Restaurant\
  \ provided a reasonably priced, tasty mixture of Mexican and Icelandic fare within\
  \ a couple of minutes walk from the hotel.  Fish&Co was a real treat.  Their dishes\
  \ are representative of local fare and come at a price, but the quality of the food\
  \ and the atmosphere of the restaurant more than make up for the price you'll pay\
  \ to spend a couple of hours here.  A little further afield, Baejarins Beztu Pylsur\
  \ provide a range of hot dog options for tasting.  TV Chef Anthony Bourdain, former\
  \ US president Bill Clinton and actor Charlie Sheen have supposedly eaten from this\
  \ food truck, which was voted the best hot dog stand in Europe by British newspaper,\
  \ The Guardian, in 2006.\n\nThere were a few experiences in and around Reykjavik\
  \ that were highlights of my time there.  The Blue Lagoon is a geothermal spa set\
  \ in a rugged lava-plain to Reykjavik\u2019s south-west.  The man-made lagoon constantly\
  \ sits between 37 and 39 degrees Celsius.  I spent three-quarters of a day here,\
  \ but the lagoon is also an easy visit on the way to or from the International Airport.\
  \  A day trip on the Golden Circle will take you to the country\u2019s Geysers,\
  \ Gulfoss Waterfall and Thingvellir National Park, among other locations.  In Reykjavik,\
  \ Hallgrimskirkja Lutheran Church, the Pearlan, and the Sun Voyager Sculpture are\
  \ worthwhile visits for their design and views over the local landscape.  The National\
  \ Museum of Iceland and Reykjavik Museum of Photography provided an insight into\
  \ the local culture and history.  Crawling through a lava tube and hiking on a glacier\
  \ tongue provided me with boast-worthy experiences to share with friends and family.\
  \  Unfortunately, my two attempts to spot the Northern Lights were unsuccessful\
  \ due to bad weather, but friends who have visited Iceland on my recommendation\
  \ have had better luck than I did.\n\nMy time in south-west Iceland was a surprising\
  \ experience.  A leap into the unknown.  Although I felt prepared for my time there,\
  \ the first few hours I spent entering and exploring the country provided me with\
  \ an unease due the inhospitable landscape and the fears that had been planted in\
  \ my mind by family and friends back home.  I returned to Iceland for a second visit\
  \ in April 2011 and have inspired trips in at least a dozen friends.  Hopefully,\
  \ I will have the opportunity to return again."
