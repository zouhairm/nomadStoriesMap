Text: "Saint Blaise is the patron saint of Dubrovnik, depicted in the city\u2019s\
  \ flag holding a sceptre while he makes a blessing sign with his free hand. Probably,\
  \ his example  inspired local authorities in their solution to revive the \u201C\
  Pearl of the Adriatic\u201D after the Croatian War of Independence, when they gave\
  \ their blessing on tourism - a cruise ship terminal was built and the airport enlarged,\
  \ permitting low-cost flights and a surplus of tourist arrivals. It seemed like\
  \ a good plan for a place that had resisted a seven month siege and was consequently\
  \ in need of economy recovery.   \n \n But soon, Dubrovnik\u2019s limestone cobbled\
  \ streets got polished by the everyday strolling of tourists, and more recently,\
  \ they flock in dozens of Game of Thrones-themed excursions, giving this town of\
  \ barely 40.000 inhabitants the same souvenir shops, tourist-trap caf\xE9s and level\
  \ of gentrification of Amsterdam, Venice or Barcelona. Suggestions should be made\
  \ for the city flag to be updated with St. Blaise holding a selfie stick instead\
  \ of a sceptre, honouring the \u201Cdisneyfication\u201D of UNESCO World Heritage.\
  \ \n \n So I decide to ask a friend for a nearby beach that\u2019s calm and frequented\
  \ by locals. Beba was born near Dubrovnik but lived the California summer of love\
  \ during the 60\u2019s and probably understands a quest for authenticity.  She tells\
  \ me to look for Kupari, refusing to give more details, telling me to see for myself\
  \ and be surprised.\n \n For first impressions, this beach is a winner - there\u2019\
  s free, spacious and palm tree-shaded parking space close to the sea. Visitors leave\
  \ their cars right next to a large building that on its heyday was used as a hotel.\
  \ Now, the belle-\xE9poque style construction is a ruin, and there are bullet marks\
  \ scattered all over its walls. \u201CBombing for peace is like f..ing for virginity\u201D\
  , says a grafitti on a side entrance, giving a laconic insight on the incoherence\
  \ of war.\n \n Kupari\u2019s panorama reveals itself as visitors leave the tree\u2019\
  s shade and approach the pebbly shore - the hills surrounding the beach are sprinkled\
  \ by large, abandoned hotels, giving this place a post-apocalyptic aura, seasoned\
  \ with dissonance, as the abandoned resorts face a blue and still sea that melts\
  \ with the clear sky. \n \n On the northern slope stands a giant building shaped\
  \ like an inverted pyramid, like a capsized bride\u2019s cake; it\u2019s short floor\
  \ spaces remind me of 80\u2019s arcade video games and it has a soviet school of\
  \ architecture feeling. On my left, there\u2019s an even larger ruin that I reluctantly\
  \ decide to enter. Right past the reception is what used to be a ballroom paved\
  \ by glass debris, with some wood ceiling beams astonishingly resisting the massive\
  \ looting subsequent to the event that made Kupari a ghostly resort. Many years\
  \ have passed since the last time music was played here, but my attention got caught\
  \ by a symphony of glass-cracking footsteps; fearing a point-blank needle assault,\
  \ I wait and discover that exploring the ruins is a common pastime both for tourists\
  \ and locals.\n \n Zoran and his friends, who live nearby, explain me that Kupari\
  \ was once a luxurious vacationing retreat for Yugoslav Army\u2019s officers. In\
  \ 1991, during the war in Croatia, the independence forces occupied the resort,\
  \ which led the Yugoslav Army to blast their own complex. They were able to recover\
  \ it for a while, but definitively forced to leave after Croatia\u2019s Independence.\
  \ As retaliation, they burnt what was left of Kupari with phosphorous bombs.\n \n\
  \ We keep visiting the ruins and reach the swimming pool, which has almost all blue\
  \ tiles covered in cement rubble. Zoran tells me that after the war the hotels were\
  \ left vacant, bound to looting of any materials that had survived the conflict;\
  \ later they became a tourist attraction on their own and only recently have been\
  \ made proposals for recovering this ghost resort. In 2016, a bid by the Marriott\
  \ group suggested the transformation of the whole bay in a five-star resort for\
  \ rich people to retreat from the other 99%. As we leave to the beach, Zoran and\
  \ I agree that it would give Kupari the Dubrovnik solution, but disguised in a premium\
  \ package."
