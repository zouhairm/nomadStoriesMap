Text: "A place that has become sort of well \u2013 known for its celebratory festivals\
  \ of the summer solstice is the prehistoric British monument of Stonehenge \u2013\
  \ made a World Heritage site in 1986. One of the biggest controversial questions\
  \ regarding the prehistoric sit of Stonehenge is why, why was it built? Stonehenge\
  \ \u2013 still unknown as to why or how it was built - has been the subject of a\
  \ multitude of theories, many labeled as bizarre, a few theories saying that out\
  \ of Earth aliens had built it or brought it here. Some suggest Stonehenge was a\
  \ significant religious site for early Britons four thousand years ago. John Aubrey\
  \ and an 18th century archaeologist William Stukeley theorized that Stonehenge was\
  \ built as a Druid temple. Although, many modern scholars have suggested that Stonehenge\
  \ predates the Druids. \nThe complex circular structure, built in three phrases\
  \ from about 3,000 B.C. and 1,600 B.C. The construction of Stonehenge is remarkable,\
  \ especially for a group of people whose only tools were deer antlers to scoop out\
  \ Earth and stones to carve and shape the stones. A complex structure, with a yet\
  \ \u2013 still mysterious background that many scholars and archaeologists and scientists\
  \ have yet to figure out. Many theories have suggested it has been some sort of\
  \ religious temple, a place of worship, a place of healing, and even a place for\
  \ celebration. \nOne celebration that has taken place at Stonehenge for many years\
  \ is the Summer Solstice Festival. Around the 20th century, groups of people have\
  \ begun gathering at Stonehenge to celebrate the Summer solstice; ultimately turning\
  \ it into a Stonehenge Free Festival, or a British Free Festival, from the years\
  \ of 1974 \u2013 1984.\nThe Winter Solstice is also tied to Stonehenge. At the Northern\
  \ Winter Solstice, people gather around to watch the sun set \u2013 not at the heel\
  \ stone \u2013 but in the midst of the three great stones, which are known as the\
  \ Trilithon. The Trilithon consists of two large vertical stones with the horizontal\
  \ stone across the top. In 2009, a picture, belonging to Getty Images, was taken\
  \ of Druid Arthur Uther Pendragon, formally known as John Rothwell, who had conducted\
  \ a service at Stonehenge on the winter solstice. \nThe day the summer solstice\
  \ happens to be the shortest day for Earth\u2019s Southern hemisphere, however it\
  \ also happens to be the day of the year with the longest period of daylight in\
  \ the northern hemisphere. Always around June 20, the northern summer solstice,\
  \ the sun\u2019s path slowly ends in the northern sky, which for the northern hemisphere,\
  \ it is the day when days begin to shorten again. Thus, in the spirit of days shortening\
  \ and the sun\u2019s path stops moving northward across the sky, the summer solstice\
  \ becomes a time of festivals and celebrations in the northern hemisphere, at least.\
  \ \nThe Stonehenge Festival was a celebration, with numerous groups of people of\
  \ various alternative cultures, such as the Tibetan Ukrainian Mountain Troupe, the\
  \ Teepee people, Circus Normal, the Peace Convoy, New Age Travellers, and the Wallys.\
  \ Not only were people from various alternative cultures present at the festivals,\
  \ many others would show up. The summer solstice is major celestial event that brings\
  \ out all the alternative cultures, as well as, modern day pagans and druids. \n\
  Reading about the Summer Solstice Festival at Stonehenge and seeing Stonehenge in\
  \ person creates a sort of reflective emotion. To watch the sunrise at a historic\
  \ site, one that has been there for thousands of years and paid witness to a thousand\
  \ of past celebrations, perhaps, sounds like a remarkable opportunity \u2013 to\
  \ see the sun rise just above the heel stone on June 20th or around that date. To\
  \ be around people who, most likely, share your ideals and all of us just gather\
  \ collectively at a historic monument to watch one of the most amazing sun rises.\
  \ Let me just say that going back to Stonehenge for the Summer Solstice Festival\
  \ would be amazing, to watch the sun rise above the heel stone, although one would\
  \ have to stand, facing northeast through the entrance, right outside of the stone\
  \ circle, in front of the Heel Stone."
