Text: "Bus ticket in hand I stood at a loss for what to do next. The bus would take\
  \ me from Madrid to Paris, marking the end of my time in Spain - the end of my Camino.\
  \ A man approached me, his left hand extended asking for money. Like so many times\
  \ before I stumbled on how to respond to begging. I am confused as to how socio-political\
  \ economic structures create poverty. In Spanish he spoke of his family and children.\
  \ How he could not work because of his small permanently cramped right hand.\n\n\
  Walking the Camino takes time, takes you to other times. Your mind slows with the\
  \ repetitive motion. Walking is the continuous act of finding your balance. Putting\
  \ one foot in front of the other keeps you present in the moment. As I gazed into\
  \ the brown eyes of the neatly kept man, I wondered how often people touched him\
  \ rather than giving money. \n\nThe village of O Cebreiro lies at the height of\
  \ land pilgrims reach when they enter the autonomous community of Galicia. The \u2018\
  Camino de Santiago de Compostela\u2019 reaches it\u2019s conclusion in Galicia.\
  \ I entered this hamlet, amid mountain tops and flecks of clouds on a bright crisp\
  \ Sunday in November. The yellow arrow has been with me the whole journey. It was\
  \ the trail markers we followed to that final stone overlooking the Atlantic. At\
  \ the pilgrims\u2019 mass that evening the priest gifted us with small stones painted\
  \ with yellow arrows. The priest announced, \u201CThe yellow arrow of life is love.\u201D\
  \n\nI asked myself, \u201CWhat would love do now?\u201D I reached out and held his\
  \ infirmed hand in both of mine, closing my eyes. The love accumulated from walking\
  \ across the landscapes of the Pyrenees, the Meseta and Galicia poured through me.\
  \ I don\u2019t know what he felt but when I opened my eyes he reached under his\
  \ collar and removed the rosary from around his neck. Black beads with silver links,\
  \ an engraving of Our Lady holding the circle together and FATIMA stamped across\
  \ the back of the crucifix suspended from the beads. \n\nHe pressed the necklace\
  \ into my hands. Tears over came me. Flooded by memories of my childhood and belief\
  \ in something bigger than myself. Rosaries were something my grandmother had cherished.\
  \ This was my talisman at the end of all the walking and contemplating. The generosity\
  \ of those I met on this pilgrimage reached new heights with this man. He moved\
  \ away from me. Another man came over and gave him money, without any words.  I\
  \ walked away changed in ways I have still yet to fully comprehend."
