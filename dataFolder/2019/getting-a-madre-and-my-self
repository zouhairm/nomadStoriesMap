Text: "\u2018Thank you, very much!\u2019, Immacolata starts. \nCountless wrinkles\
  \ on her face blaze, her eyes blink with a distant light.\n\u2018Basta madre!\u2019\
  , Alberto, her son scowls. \nShe stares at him, offended.  \nWe all know, she wanted\
  \ to start her childhood memory with the American troops came this region at the\
  \ end of WWII. She wanted to tell how she got \u2018caramelle\u2019 from them, how\
  \ they smiled at her, the story she told a thousand times before. \n\u2018Madre,\
  \ chiedi.\u2019, I encourage.\nHer grandchild Rafaelle, works in Air Force and Alberto\
  \ exchange gaze, smile. \nShe starts, again her eyes blink. \n \nSun is disappearing\
  \ by a water-bound peak. \nReddish orange light is melting on Tyrrhenian Sea of\
  \ Capaccio-Paestum (an ancient Greek city, Poseidonia of 550 to 450 BC), water constantly\
  \ changing its colours and shades. \nGentle wind moves away her short hair; sound\
  \ of sea waves accompany Madre\u2019s words just like a Cello concerto from romantic\
  \ period as if life just begins after a horrible war. Three listeners are waiting\
  \ to wind up. \n\nA bikini-lady\u2019s silhouette figure, running on the sand, her\
  \ silhouette-puppy follows by. \n\nMadre wears an old fashion dress, not interested\
  \ for a bath, never goes for a bikini, but likes it. She spent her childhood beside\
  \ this beach, played with her chums on this wide empty coast; where, were nobody\
  \ for a luxury sun tanned bath, were no one with bikini.\n    \nI embarrassed with\
  \ my bikini, covered my hip with a small decorated cloth. \nIt\u2019s my first day\
  \ dare to wear a bikini.\n \nMadre\u2019s story ends. I go into the water again,\
  \ it\u2019s cold, and I start to shiver. Madre worries, covers me with a towel,\
  \ embraces tight to warm me up.  \n\nI\u2019m leaving Kolkata International Airport\
  \ to Roma, first time to fly, first time to abroad with lots of uncertainty. Leaving\
  \ my marginalized memories; was being a girl child, being a woman, being a poet\
  \ and filmmaker. \n\nMy ma (mother) happy and worried, dare to leave me alone as\
  \ she did before when I left my village for higher education, first generation of\
  \ my family to step out.  \n\nI recognize Alberto, seen his pictures, approaching\
  \ with a smile outside of Leonardo da Vinci airport. I\u2019m trying to be steady\
  \ and easy without knowing that I\u2019m going to meet a lady who will become my\
  \ \u2018Madre\u2019.  \n\nAlberto, an actor, organised a film festival. My film\
  \ selected there.  \n\n\u2018\u09AE\u09BE, \u0995\u09C0 \u0995\u09B0\u099B\u09CB\
  ?\u2019 (Ma, what are you doing?), my mother doesn\u2019t care, caressing her chickens,\
  \ \u2018Who will eat the meat and eggs?\u2019. We, me & siblings scowl; chickens\
  \ are here and there inside the room with lots of chicks. \n\nMadre is caressing\
  \ her chicks, inside carton boxes in her apartment. After some days when they are\
  \ strong enough she leaves them with the hen in the  courtyard. \n\nMy mother collects\
  \ male pumpkin-flowers from neighbors\u2019 garden to breed female pumpkin-flowers\
  \ of her garden. She does pollen connection with her fingers as there are no male\
  \ flowers in her garden and a few insects to do that.    \n\n\u2018Madre, so many\
  \ Pumpkin flowers!\u2019, I\u2019m exited.\nMadre is on the balcony, against a sepia\
  \ tone back light, sorting lots of flowers from her garden, smiles, \u2018piccolina,\
  \ \xE8 fiori di zucca.\u2019  \nNever-seen-before Zucchini flower looks familiar.\
  \ \n\nA bikini lady lies down on the sand with her baby girl, moving the kid up\
  \ and down, smiling. A man with colored swim wear stands beside them, his shadow\
  \ covers the baby and the mother. \n \nAgain, we are by the sea. I uncover my bikini.\
  \ Madre smiles at me, \u2018Bellissima!\u2019\nAfter a several trial and failure\
  \ I\u2019m not covering my hip with a cloth, even not embarrassed. Ah! No one\u2019\
  s gaze is uncomfortable. A very tiny black insect belongs from the sand bites me.\
  \ I start, find it, and throw away. \nMadre is telling Rafaelle, he may go anywhere\
  \ to stop war and will give caramelle to a war-effected little girl. \n    \nSunbeam\
  \ filtered through my glass, thinking of my childhood female companions. Most of\
  \ them are victims of child marriage, exhausted with lots of children and grandchildren,\
  \ most of them never went to school.   \nI could be one of them.  \nOh! No! \nThat\
  \ should not be me.  \n\nMadre smiles, tells me, \u2018Piccolina!\u2019"
