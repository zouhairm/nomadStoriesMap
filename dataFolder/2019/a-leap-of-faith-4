Text: "Arriving late into the night, I get dropped off under the bridge that crosses\
  \ the two banks of the Ganges river in Praygraj. It is cold, a low haze hangs in\
  \ the air, filled with dust, smoke and, the brightness of the white led light illuminating\
  \ what felt like a sea of tents. Here I was at my first Kumbh Mela, an event known\
  \ as the \"largest religious gathering in the world.\"\n\nAs I made my way to locate\
  \ my camp amongst the many campsites along the river banks, I felt lost. Not only\
  \ were the majority of the signs in Hindi, which I could not read but the few people\
  \ I came across did not know where my camp was. \n\nAfter a few calls and walking\
  \ around aimlessly, I reached my campsite where I met fellow German videographer\
  \ Maciej with whom I was sharing the tent for the next three nights. \n\nThe next\
  \ day, I started out exploring the various section of the event grounds. With the\
  \ most significant part being, at the confluence of the two rivers that go through\
  \ the city; the Yamuna and the Ganges where the ceremonial baths were held.  \n\n\
  Navigating my way around; tents, camps, \"akhara,\" and the waves of pilgrims departing\
  \ and arriving is overwhelming. An entire generation of family members and people\
  \ from all walks of life making the journey. I was moved by witnessing a group of\
  \ elderly believers partaking in the holy baths and offering rituals on the Ganges.\n\
  \nUpon further exploration, I came across a group of devotees sitting around a naked\
  \ man. He was covered in ash like paste all over his body with long dreadlocks while\
  \ he lectured to a gathering he received at his \"Akhara,\" a makeshift monastery.\
  \ I found out they were called \"Naga Sadhus.\" Mostly composed of holy men and\
  \ a few women, they follow a path of spiritual discipline renouncing to the worldly\
  \ life. \n\nAs I listened in to their preaching, I could not help to wonder about\
  \ their teaching and their lifestyle. Here, I was, far away from my birthplace,\
  \ witnessing and experiencing a completely different culture, different from what\
  \ I was thought growing up in Africa. Christianity, God, Faith, and spirituality\
  \ from a  different perspective.\n\n\" What is faith ?, What is enlightenment and\
  \ how does one reach it ?, What is the difference between, Christianity, Hinduism\
  \ ?, What is right and What is wrong ?\" \nThese are just some of the interrogations\
  \ that were on my mind as I walked back to my tent. I met up with Maciej, and we\
  \ planned to wake up early the next morning to partake in the significant ritual\
  \ bath passage with the Naga Sadhus.\n\nI could barely sleep, our camp was situated\
  \ next to one of the Ashrams with all-night prayers and chanting going on. \n\n\
  Waking up at three in the morning, we made our way to one of the bridges which we\
  \ anticipated was going to be used for the Naga Sadhus procession as the made their\
  \ way to the \" Triveni Sangam.\" The point of confluence of the holy rivers. \n\
  \nThe Nagas were electric, after smoking what seemed to be cannabis, the lined up\
  \ in groups and departed towards the Sangam. Without hesitating, I joined the procession\
  \ with other followers. \n\nIt was a surreal moment. Jostling each other, and chanting\
  \ prayers as we made our way to the Sangam. I observed hundreds if not thousands\
  \ of devotees behind the fences just made think of how blessed I was to participate\
  \ in a significant moment of the Indian culture. \n\n The energy was electrifying.\n\
  \nArriving at Sangam, the Sadhus armed with tridents and swords charged down to\
  \ the waters to bathe along with a mass of followers. \n\nIt dawned on me; that\
  \ this right here was unbelievably one of the most powerful moments of my journey.\
  \ Witnessing faith, and spirituality on another level and lots of unanswered questions."
