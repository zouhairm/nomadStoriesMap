Text: "I set out from Montevideo a breezy five hours ahead of my booking.  Who wants\
  \ to be rushed on holiday?  I headed northeast, making a slight detour to Punta\
  \ Ballena.  I'd spotted something architecturally scintillating here.  I'd expected\
  \ to find a structure around which one could stroll and snap pictures.  Instead\
  \ I found a museum, a shrine, if you will, to the artist who'd designed and inhabited\
  \ it.  This was so much more enticing.  Museo Taller was the converted home of Uruguayan\
  \ artist Carlos P\xE1ez Vilar\xF3.  The building was white, with curvy edges and\
  \ stalagmite-like spires pointing skyward.  It whiffed of Greek villa mixed with\
  \ Mexican desert dwelling, with a galactic twist.  Among the displays was a photo\
  \ exhibition of the infamous Andean air crash in which survivors consumed their\
  \ dead friends.  I thought this out of place.  Later I read that one of the survivors\
  \ was indeed this artist's son.\n\nAfter this I dashed on.  Plenty more kilometres\
  \ lay ahead.  Getting nearer my destination, I realised how wrong I'd been when\
  \ I'd imagined what I'd find.  I knew, of course, that the restaurant was in the\
  \ countryside, but I'd expected to pass farm stalls, quaint coffee shops and souvenir\
  \ stores.  Instead, as I twitched over gravel surfaces between farmlands, there\
  \ was simply nothing else around.  Bodega Garz\xF3n, it turned out, was on a young\
  \ vineyard, surrounded by naught but cattle farms.  The nearest settlement, twelve\
  \ kilometres away, was Pueblo Garz\xF3n, population 198.\n\nPassing through a gate,\
  \ I continued down the driveway, at first seeing no structure, until an expansive\
  \ yet unassuming edifice sprung suddenly from among the low hills.   Its dust-brown\
  \ exterior melted seamlessly into the rustic environment.  Within, the decor was\
  \ magnificent, the waitrons sofisti-elegant.  Attention to detail was evident in\
  \ everything.  Cutlery was laid on napkins, each fork on its side, packed tight\
  \ against all the other forks, as were the knives and spoons.  Each unused table\
  \ outside was adorned with a large basket of fresh lemons.  A smaller replica echoed\
  \ the motif on each table inside.\n\nThe choices on the menu were few.  From Chef's\
  \ Table, a Netflix show that led me to this restaurant, I'd learned that in a place\
  \ like this, one put all one's trust in the chef.  I was at least able to avoid\
  \ seafood.  Throughout my stay, the service was attentive.  These were clearly properly\
  \ trained, highly motivated servers.  An assortment of bread arrived, three kinds,\
  \ each with its own flavour of olive oil for dipping.  The dapper wine steward described\
  \ each oil and recommended not only which press to use with which bread, but also\
  \ the correct sequence, beginning with the mild virgin and white bread, progressing\
  \ through to the richest bottle and darkest bread.  This was, as it happens, a precursory\
  \ metaphor of the food itself. \n\nThe first course was a calm adagio, played softly\
  \ by viola, oboe, harp and the occasional tap of the castanets. ...... Burnt spring\
  \ onion on a bed of mash, a yellowish paste-sauce I couldn't quite put my finger\
  \ on, dusted with brittle crumbs.  The aroma was wonderful, the flavours subtle,\
  \ the textures surprising and delightful.  The second course became bolder, a sarabande,\
  \ only slightly louder, by cello, bassoon, trombone and rain stick. ...... Smoked\
  \ tongue on a slightly roasted potato slice, topped with a barely cooked yolk and\
  \ drizzled with walnuts.  Fuller, richer, the nuts less crunchy than the first course\
  \ crumbs.  After this course, fallen specks of bread were dusted off my white linen\
  \ placemat.  What a delightful, forgotten tradition!\n\nThe main attraction was\
  \ a step up again.  A deep, broad river flowed steadily but powerfully through dense,\
  \ peaceful woods.  The full string section competed with the lush woodwinds.  The\
  \ music crescendoed, full but gentle and melodic....... Lamb, polenta and pistachios\
  \ in a fruity, thin, broth-like sauce.  Absolutely delightful, explosive.  The finish\
  \ did not simmer.  Rich, delicate sweetness caressed the tongue and larynx, gradually\
  \ slowing but not quieting, ending in climax. ...... Cr\xE8me caramel, ice cream\
  \ and butterscotch sauce speckled with crushed nuts.\n\nI'd arrived at the restaurant\
  \ ravenous.  After the gastronomical entertainment, I didn't eat again for the rest\
  \ of the day."
