Text: "I received call from a friend saying he got job in Nellore and can join him.\
  \ I was blank but had to run from home just to have some time so gave a shot.\n\
  There I was on station, figuring which side of city I need to go. Finally phone\
  \ rings, come to other side of station he says. \nDark night, silent roads thinking\
  \ like is it a ghost city. Finally reached and slept tight.\n\nWhat a sunny day\
  \ it was!!! Now time was to hunt for some breakfast. Telugu everywhere, and I was\
  \ like in different India. \nSo my friend took me to a small stall type hotel where\
  \ a lady used to make dosa with speed of train. Finally my order arrived, egg dosa\
  \ with thick coconut chutney.. I wonder how much she earns looking the crowd at\
  \ her place.\n\nReturned to office, welcomed by the person in charge. He said I\
  \ can travel with my friend. Oh I forgot to tell he was sales engineer there and\
  \ used to travel villages.\nI just accompanied him. Afterall he need someone to\
  \ ride a bike so he could relax behind. \n\nThat's where I started traveling through\
  \ highways to small villages to the fields. What a feeling you have that just can't\
  \ express. That period our God was google maps. Riding through dirt roads,so many\
  \ huge water reservoirs and birds have seen made me fall for those views.\n\nIt\
  \ was noon by the time and stomach was growling. We halted nearby village had biryani\
  \ and a beer. Oh the food part, Nellore where rice is staple food and you mostly\
  \ get biryani,  egg rice, Idli-dosa, curd-rice. I left my friend there in the village\
  \ and started exploring the nearby area. As I started I could just see farm ponds\
  \ everywhere. People generally did aquaculture here. Sweet water Indian fishes and\
  \ my favorite thats king prawns were cultured. People mostly speak Telugu and feels\
  \ like its a different country itself with rare Hindi speakers. Liquor is cheap\
  \ and rice is staple food. That's how day ended.\n\nNext day my friend had field\
  \ inspection in some village so we started riding towards eat just after finishing\
  \ egg dosa. As I pass through road I just see wood everywhere and huge open fields.\
  \ People here also do wood farming here. People with fields are very rich here,\
  \ just plant trees and cut it after its matured. Finally we reached our field. It\
  \ was acid lime field, I mean lemon farming. 5acres of land just sits lemon trees\
  \ with sweet smell of lime in air. After our work they served us food. Rice, Daal,\
  \ egg and curd having under a tree in a farm with unknown family cooked by a beautiful\
  \ caring mother. Roaming and seeing nearby fields where lady finger was grown, coconut\
  \ farming, balck smiths where long and huge knifes were made. And another day passed.\
  \ \nNext day arrived where we were going to visit a dog kennel where Indian dogs\
  \ were bred and yes of course other dogs were also bred. Travelling through highway\
  \ with beautiful clouds above, fresh air, sky reflecting on farmponds across highways.\
  \ \nAfter that we decided to visit beach. So headed towards Krishnapatnam. So there\
  \ we could see reliance nuclear plant and port. Oh what a marvelous nuclear power\
  \ station it was. We reached beach less crowd with fish stalls serving fresh fried\
  \ fish. Having fish and prawns with a beer chilling and relaxing with view sea and\
  \ sound of tides is peace sometimes.\n\nThis is how I spent my days a break from\
  \ home, exploring rural India which was amazing and that's why India is called agricultural\
  \ country. You know many things specially how people live and survive. Traveling\
  \ northern hills is amazing I agree but travelling south has its own beauty with\n\
  all are harmless beautiful people. With all beautiful and amazing memories written\
  \ wrought my eyes to heart I returned home."
