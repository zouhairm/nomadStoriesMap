Text: "King Jahangir once told \u201Cif heaven on earth is there,it is here, it is\
  \ here\u201D.Kashmir the land of beautiful ice caped mountains, and green valleys.\
  \ If you\u2019ve been there once you want to go back again and again, but when i\
  \ went this time of the year, i looked closely to the life of people staying over\
  \ there;as a tourist we go for four to seven days enjoy and come back, but people\
  \ over there face the harsh reality of life, there is no proper electricityover\
  \ there, people live in fear all the time because when their lif\u2019s can change\
  \ in a split second even they dont know, they would be happy to get a two meal perday\
  \ and live to see the next day.\nPeople have misunderstood kashmirians cause they\
  \ are a muslim, well let me tell you all muslims arent terrorist, a terroist is\
  \ like a no man\u2019s land, they dont have any religion and faith, their minds\
  \ are filled with corruptions and misconceptions.people over their are very helpfull\
  \ and humble towards you.They treat you as one of your family  members and make\
  \ sky and land as one to fullfill your one request.\n  Well there are many scenic\
  \ beauties to see in kashmir but most mesmerizing view is Gulmarg\u2019s gondola\
  \ which take you to the peak of the icecaped mountain, i can guarantee that riding\
  \ the gondola is fun but riding back down on a snowbike will give you a thriller\
  \ experience of a lifetime.\nAnd then comes Pehalgam 3to4hoirs away from Gulmarg\
  \ , the best part of staying in pehalgam was setting a camp site near the river\
  \ and doing river rafting in that ice chilled water.Seeing the sum rise from behind\
  \ the mountain, is really a god\u2019s art.\nDal lake, gamous gor there boathouses\
  \ because the interrior and furniture is made of walnut wood,I tell you there are\
  \ many artistic men in kashmir who do beautiful kashmiri walnut wood work. we have\
  \ to go to the house boat with the inhouse taxi boats famously known as \u201CShikara\u201D\
  . Kashmiri row the boat and take you to the boat house.\n The boat house consist\
  \ of a a living room, dinning area, and 3to 4 rooms,which have the basic amenities\
  \ which a guest might need.\n I agree kashmir isnot safe right now right now, but\
  \ i feel because of the soilders and militants constant war, Kashmir might lose\
  \ its charm and beauty very soon. Maybe are upcoming generations may not be able\
  \ to see the heaven which god has built on earth."
