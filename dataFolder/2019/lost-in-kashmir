Text: "Lost. Trudging through the woods in waist deep snow, it was dark, and bitterly\
  \ cold. \nKashmir was wild.\nUnbeknown to me; I was getting closer to the disputed\
  \ Indian and Pakistani Line of Control.\n\nI had not expected the adventure of skiing\
  \ in the Indian Himalayas to get this extreme. After leading my four new friends\
  \ down a beautifully enticing  bowl, we had found ourselves descending further and\
  \ further down a gully, towards Pakistan. No wonder we were making fresh lines in\
  \ the deep powder, as no other skiers had taken this route. Ever.\nSteep mountains\
  \ rose up on either side, there was the only one direction to take, which meant\
  \ continuously crossing an icy, glacial river. Our measly day snacks were long gone,\
  \ along with our energy.\n\nCrossing tracks in the snow of the elusive snow leopard,\
  \ darkness fell and the level of peril increased. Our torches had died from the\
  \ cold and only one phone remained, with no signal. A thick blanket of stars was\
  \ the ceiling to the tree-lined valley, the clearly visible Milky Way was an incredible\
  \ sight, but even that momentary escape couldn\u2019t distract from our situation.\n\
  Gunfire echoed over the mountains reminding me that we were not in the Swiss Alps.\n\
  I silently contemplated the prospect of spending a night in the woods, acknowledging\
  \ that not all of the group would wake up in the morning.\n\nA light appeared in\
  \ sight on a distant ridge, it was hope.\nTrudging closer, shouting and trying to\
  \ draw attention, dogs could be heard barking from within what looked like an army\
  \ base; did they know we were out here?\nThe phone with a few percent of battery\
  \ suddenly found a bar of signal. We hastily made contact to our hosts back in the\
  \ village, they were already in the local Police station, trying to organise a search\
  \ and alerting the Indian army that there were five foreign tourists lost in the\
  \ area. \nUnbeknown to us, there had been an incident that very morning with Pakistani\
  \ terrorists infiltrating an Indian base and killing 4 Indian soldiers.\nUnderstandably,\
  \ there was heightened security in the usually twitchy area. The order was \u2018\
  shoot to kill\u2019 any persons seen near a base in this restricted area but the\
  \ army was now at least aware that there were lost souls on the mountain. \n\nLater\
  \ finding out that there was a 3-5 minute window between the connected call and\
  \ being within range of the base as the command was changed was a scary prospect,\
  \ bringing home the peril of the day.\n\nReaching a shabby corrugated iron fence,\
  \ heavily covered with razor wire, soldiers appeared out of the darkness and surrounded\
  \ us.\n\n \u201CWho are you? Where are you from? How did you get here?\u201D\n\n\
  Bright flashlights blinded our sight.\n\n \u201CDrop your bags, put your hands up!\u201D\
  \n\n\nIntimidating us with AK-47s pointing us where to go, we were led up a track\
  \ and ordered to sit down on the dirt, freezing, tired and hungry, our belongings\
  \ dumped in a pile, we obediently did as we were told.\n\n\u201CDo you know where\
  \ you are? You are on the Line of Control; you are two kilometers away from Pakistan.\
  \ You are very lucky! If you went there you would be dead already!\u201D\n\nWe had\
  \ put ourselves in an extreme situation. We had almost been killed. \nWe were in\
  \ various states of cold, hypothermia, shock and anxiety.\n\n\u201CIt is not possibly\
  \ to get here from Gulmarg, it is too far,\u201D said one of the soldiers, \u201C\
  You must have planned this.\u201D\n\nThis was all we needed now, a conspiracy against\
  \ a small group of foolish travellers on skis.\n\nWe were ordered to move from the\
  \ dirt track into the base, ducking through a low gate, hanging off its hinges.\
  \ Entering what looked like a construction site, small buildings were scattered\
  \ amongst diggers and piles of rubble, we were led into a cold bunker with two wooden\
  \ beds without matresses, the steel door was shut behind us and we were left alone.\n\
  \nWas this the end of us? Our imaginations drew up \u2018worst-case scenario\u2019\
  \ movie scenes."
