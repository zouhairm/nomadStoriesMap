Text: "It was not the utterly silence for 10 days nor 12 long hours sitting on the\
  \ floor every day that was the biggest problem. The simple task of observing myself\
  \ being present on the Sri Lankan hilltop was.\n\n \u201CAyubowan! May you be happy\
  \ in the next 10 days, and in the rest of your life\u201D.  The smiling man in front\
  \ of us fold his hands and make a bow as we get of our tuk-tuk at the gates of the\
  \ Dhamma Kuta Vipassana center, beautiful situated in the hills of Mahakanda, Sri\
  \ Lanka. After 2 weeks of kitesurfing in the Kalpitya lagoon and spending a week\
  \ with rescued street dogs and cats at the Fire Dragon Hideaway in Negombo, we are\
  \ saying goodbye to the outside world and are ready for the test. No smart phone,\
  \ no news, no social media feed, no music, no television nor books. And not talking\
  \ to anyone for 10 days. We were ready to learn the art of living. Sounds like the\
  \ perfect getaway, right? \n\nBecoming the next Buddha\nThere are 196 Vipassana\
  \ centers around the world, and they all teach the technique of Vipassana meditation,\
  \ rediscovered by Siddh\u0101rtha Gautama, the Buddha, more than 2500 years ago.\
  \ The father of these retreats is the late SN Goenka, who was raised in Myanmar\
  \ and learned the technique from monks there. We are about to follow in his footsteps.\
  \ As most of the students are locals, we are a small group of travelers who have\
  \ found Dhamma Kuta. Vitali Haiduchenko (30) has come all the way from Ukraine to\
  \ try to manage his mind. On the tenth day, he is overwhelmed.\n\"These 10 days\
  \ made me realize that my mind is giving way too much importance to the past and\
  \ the future. Learning the technique of observing the flow of respiration and sensations\
  \ will surely help me living me life at the present, and not having cravings or\
  \ aversions towards the outside world.\"\n\nRice and curry\nGoing through the 10\
  \ days of silence while meditating is a personal experience. On the line behind\
  \ me, Stephan Schaner from Switzerland has just finished his first course. After\
  \ travelling China, Mongolia, Tibet and India, he got his place just a day prior\
  \ and managed to get in from India.\n\u201C The Dhamma Kuta is a wonderful place.\
  \ It is away from the hustle and bustle and placed in the midst of nature. However,\
  \ I really did not appreciate the nature and landscape that much, as I realized\
  \ that also nature can be \"noisy\xBB. On the journey into my inner world, the outside\
  \ world became irrelevant, even though I had brief looks at the playing monkeys,\
  \ the setting sun and the hilly panorama. And the vegetarian food is just amazing\u201D\
  \ During the whole week we get the obligatory rice and curry, the culinary king\
  \ of the nation\xB4s food scene, with sauces based on coconut milk and fiery chillies,\
  \ and I realize that the art of living is not just about meditation. Is about enjoying\
  \ nature, food and living every moment as it was my last one."
