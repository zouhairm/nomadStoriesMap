Text: "The Fernando Belaunde Terry Highway is an irregular and lethargic snake with\
  \ views of the montane forests and turfy hills prevalent in northeastern Peru. After\
  \ traveling several kilometers towards the Corosha district in the Amazonas region,\
  \ my eyes paused at the uneven heights that drew the hills. It was night when we\
  \ reached the district of Pedro Ruiz and several hasty trucks dodged us as we halted\
  \ on the marginal road. From the gloomy fields a stunted man approached the driver\u2019\
  s window and handed him a bunch of carachamas; tattooed and prehistoric fish that\
  \ minutes later sat with us on the route.\n\nBy the time we arrived to the secluded\
  \ village of Beirut, two hours away from the city of Chachapoyas, our bleary eyes\
  \ couldn\u2019t make out anything beyond dark shades of land. I climbed out of the\
  \ van to realize I had underestimated the cold and couldn\u2019t help but feel I\
  \ was entering into an obscure passage whose end was at the beginning of the next\
  \ day. Fortunately a local woman greeted us into her home and served us some warm\
  \ arracachas, yellow colored roots that tasted like sweet aromatic carrots. \n\n\
  I spent the night in the home of Lizzet Garcia, one of the nine local women that\
  \ provided a room inside her home for visitors; travellers, biologists, photographers\
  \ and adventurers who had come to follow the five-hour hike to the Private Conservation\
  \ Area of Hierbabuena \u2013 Allpayacu. Despite our varied backgrounds, we all had\
  \ one thing in common \u2013we were motivated by the presence of a rare species\
  \ of a golden spectacled bear and endemic woolly monkeys. \n\nVictor Ramos, a local\
  \ farmer and chaperon would lead my horse\u2019s way through the hectares of montane\
  \ forest. As he walked by my side he told me a story. Weeks earlier, he\u2019d been\
  \ making his way through the forest riding my nameless horse and had spotted a light\
  \ golden pelage shimmering under the sun. \u201CI\u2019ve seen lots of \u2018negritos\u2019\
  \ but to see the golden one is a matter of God,\u201D he told me. That golden spectacled\
  \ bear, who\u2019s been named \u201CPaddy\u201D after it was caught by a camera\
  \ trap in this territory,  is now the symbol of the community of Beirut and one\
  \ of the reasons why the locals have decided to protect their biodiverse forest.\
  \ \n\nOn the first day we had no luck finding the bear, but next morning Lucas Guivin,\
  \ a guide who\u2019s been following the endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkeys\
  \ since he was a child, woke us up at 5 am. Dark and numbingly cold outside, Lucas\
  \ led the way as we strode through the dusky shade of the dense thicket canopy,\
  \ stepping over mossy barks and crackling leaves along the way. As we descended\
  \ deeper into the forest, the epiphytes and lichens clung to the trunks as if they\
  \ had arms that seized the trees. I let the silentious procession move forward and\
  \ stayed behind with Victor and his companion guide Demetrio Reyes whose cheek was\
  \ puffed up with a saliva-soaked ball of coca leaves.\n\nWe walked at our own pace,\
  \ bushwhacking and lifting our heads to track the agile monkeys\u2019 steps.  Minutes\
  \ after, we spotted a group of primates mirthfully swinging on the summit of the\
  \ branches. The deep mahogany color of their dense furry bodies began to glimmer\
  \ as the sunlight stroked through the boughs. I found myself staring at them in\
  \ awe, amazed by the spectacle and feeling a liberating sense of solitariness as\
  \ they maneuvered and lazed over the trees\u2019 arms above us.  \n\n\u201CNot all\
  \ have that huge yellow pubic tuft,\u201D Demetrio told me, as we followed our path\
  \ to the refuge some hours later. I had forgotten all about the bears. All I could\
  \ think about was the hurrying brook that awaited me back at our shack. I would\
  \ submerge beneath one of its subtle cascades, freeze and feel alive. \n\nHowever,\
  \ as we hurried skyward hungry and pleased by the warm beams of sunlight that fell\
  \ directly on us, we heard a fervent yell coming from the other side of the forest;\
  \ it wasn\u2019t a desperate wail, it was one of joy: \u201CBear, bear!\u201D hollered\
  \ one of the guides. I felt my heart thumping."
