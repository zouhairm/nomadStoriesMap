Text: "It was the 2nd last day of our trip across the Wild West of the U.S. The sun\
  \ was beginning to set over the massive stretch of Nevada desert we were cruising\
  \ through in our reliable rocket of a Jeep; en route to Vegas. Our blissful absorption\
  \ of the scenery was suddenly interrupted by a strange noise coming from the engine\
  \ soon followed by the realisation that we were pretty much out of gas and there\
  \ wasn't a dot of anything to be seen on the horizon. Panic began to set in. If\
  \ we stalled here we would not have had a clue what to do or who to do it with;\
  \ i had also left my phone on the roof of the car two stops ago. \n\nAll of the\
  \ above was happening at the end of an action-packed and delightfully dramatic 10\
  \ day road adventure with my buddy from college back in Ireland. This had involved\
  \ (including but not limited to): over 12 hours on the road most days, driving through\
  \ streams in the middle of the night, skidding on fallen rocks and almost spinning\
  \ off the edge of a cliff (several times), being sick and having to find a doctor\
  \ in a place where the middle of knowwhere was clearly first established, and running\
  \ through a forest thinking we were being chased by bears (also in the middle of\
  \ the night); to the slightly more mundain fun and frollicks of witnessing a police-chase\
  \ with cop cars and helicopters speeding through L.A. free-way traffic, while on\
  \ the way to see the 'Stars' in Hollywood. \n\nSome say that in life you are better\
  \ off to just take the good with the bad (and occasionally the ugly), and of course\
  \ there was a lot of good to be garnered too. The characters & connections in the\
  \ people you meet in the U.S. seem to be more varied, precarious, and lasting that\
  \ anywhere else I have been. Seeming to have an amazing way of actually giving you\
  \ your own live hollywood movie, if that is indeed what you're looking for; and\
  \ if you're looking for something else, to be fair they probably have that too.\n\
  \nBack to the deserted desert...To add insult to injury, we had also been sleeping\
  \ in the Jeep every night, which, needless to say, was not as fun as we had imagined.\
  \ So to say that we were not taking it in our stride that we might now be stranded\
  \ in the middle of the desert with a clapped out means of transport, no phone, and\
  \ no consumable liquids, would be an exaggeration. All we could do at this point\
  \ was drive in the slow lane at the slowest possible speed for as long as possible\
  \ and hope for the best. We approached a long steep hill that seemed to go on for\
  \ eternity. The engine continued to shudder. Steam or smoke was now spilling out\
  \ of the engine.\n\nJust over the hump of that hill a gas station appeared in the\
  \ distance, almost like a mirage. We chugged at snails pace down the other side\
  \ of the incline and into our apparent rescue centre. It was decided that we would\
  \ relax for a while, wait for the sun to go down, engine to cool, and re-fuel of\
  \ ourselves and the jeep before taking off again.\n\nAs we leaned against the bonnet,\
  \ both almost on empty, waiting for the sun to make a final exit, a van entered\
  \ the scene and appeared to be doing the same as ourselves. After a few moments\
  \ of stretching out the legs one of the passengers of the other vehicle called my\
  \ name out across the station. It was an old buddy from where i grew up. They were\
  \ also on their way to Vegas, and had 2 rooms booked in one of the fanciest hotels\
  \ on the strip. So in typical 'American Dream' fashion, that's where we spent our\
  \ last night, in absolute luxury, surrounded by bright lights, shiny things, beer,\
  \ buffets, air-con, blankets, and lots of laughs.\n\nYou never truly know what's\
  \ round the next bend...but sometimes its worth it to just go with it, and enjoy\
  \ the ride."
