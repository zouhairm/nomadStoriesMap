Text: "An ice-cold Tona in my hands is the only respite from the heavy, stifling,\
  \ heat and humidity. I shift uncomfortably in my seat, but it\u2019s not only the\
  \ heat, its the intense gaze Carlos is directing at me, the type that directly captures\
  \ you. Carlos is giving the group not only a reality check but a privilege check.\
  \ This isn\u2019t being done in a malicious manner, I\u2019m the one giving myself\
  \ the privilege check. Because the story Carlos paints of Nicaragua is a direct\
  \ juxtaposition to my apparently charmed Australian life.\n\n\u201CSo how serious\
  \ is the civil war\u201D I cautiously ask, speaking quietly, eyes darting around\
  \ out of fear of rousing attention in this local cafe.\n\n\u201CI wouldn\u2019t\
  \ call it a civil war, the government has total control\u201D Carlos states back,\
  \ no sense of fear in his voice only nationalist pride. He has mentioned earlier\
  \ he is ready to die defending his countries honour, so I am fully aware of Carlos\u2019\
  \ stance. But, somehow as he talks I am enraptured, seeing an altogether different\
  \ perspective from the tabloids and guide books.\n\u201CUs civilians have no chance\
  \ against grenades and machine guns, all we have is firecrackers and homemade weapons.\
  \ If you had come to Nicaragua only 9 months earlier the street outside here and\
  \ all of Leon would have been barricaded\u201D\n\n\u201CMany people would just disappear,\
  \ you can be arrested for simply flying a Nicaraguan flag as it is illegal\u201D\
  \ \n\nI take another gulp of my refreshing cerveza, although I find the reality\
  \ of Nicaraguan life a little harder to swallow. The images of Nicaragua that I\u2019\
  ve conjured in my head are slowly crumbling down, the colourful colonial streets\
  \ now seem a little more tainted. Upon entering Nicaragua the group had been military\
  \ searched, overlooked with intense stares by a rifle-wielding general. An early\
  \ indication of what the next seven days would entail; but also a seemingly normal\
  \ occurrence of daily Nicaraguan life. Driving into Leon it had also become seemingly\
  \ obvious the lack of people, the ramshackle houses boarded up and the abundance\
  \ of locked doors, the aftermath of mass exodus. Despite friendly smiles and welcoming\
  \ hospitality, a blanket of gloom seemed to permeate the streets.\n\n\u201CWe are\
  \ fine, we are survivors, the people are returning but many have left\u201D Carlos\
  \ states somewhat optimistically. \u201CBut we still have very far to go.\u201D\n\
  \nDays later my personal feelings of discomfort remain with me and in an ever selfish\
  \ manner, it is regarding my personal safety. Despite the fact that Carlos has stated\
  \ tourists are safe, we aren\u2019t the targets, I am struggling to find solace\
  \ in his words. The intensity and passion of Carlos words indicate that unrest is\
  \ still widespread, that the fight for a better life is still being fought behind\
  \ closed doors.\n\nTwo days later like many before him, Carlos\u2019 optimism is\
  \ slashed, Carlos is forced to flee his country.\n\nThe entire group hears the phone\
  \ call, the words uttered \u201Cthe police are at my house\u201D; everyone sees\
  \ the fear and panic that passes across Carlos\u2019 face. Unsure of what is going\
  \ on all we know is that our bags are unloaded from his car quickly and rushed goodbyes\
  \ are given. At dinner that night the puzzle is pieced together, the tour leader\
  \ tells us Carlos is fleeing Nicaragua, the police have come to persecute him; his\
  \ days here are numbered. \n\nHe is now an enemy of the government.\nI find these\
  \ words hard to fathom.\n\nDays pass before any news, but when it comes the feeling\
  \ of relief that floods us all is unifying, Carlos has made it safely to Costa Rica.\
  \ In the three days that passes Carlos traversed the continent, gotten rejected\
  \ entry to Mexico and been placed on a refugee flight to Costa Rica.\nHowever, the\
  \ connection we all feel to Carlos\u2019 and his plight is somewhat heartening,\
  \ some consolation that despite all the unrest in the world, empathy can cross barriers\
  \ between languages, religions and continents. Our personal compassion won\u2019\
  t, however, allow Carlos to return home; and as we all say adios to Central America\
  \ the last reality check truly sinks in. \n\nWe can all return home."
