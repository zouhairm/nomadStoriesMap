Text: "\"Travel\" what an important word, in my point of view, for example, is where\
  \ I can do a connection between two or more places with different values, cultures,\
  \ and others. With this idea in mind, I decided to visit Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil.\
  \ \nIt was so enthusiastic about the paradise beaches, the beautiful people, it\
  \ was awesome! I was walking through Rio\u2019s central city and I saw a little\
  \ far distance from me the Tomorrow\u2019s Museum.  A big planet in the main entrance\
  \ showed the effects of global warming and it contrasts with how the planet was\
  \ in the prior ages. Oh my god, I swear my mind was not in the full state of healthy\
  \ to describe what my eyes were looking to. \nIn the upstairs another touching scene\
  \ but at this time one hundred times more touching than see my world being destroyed\u2026\
  But you can think with yourself \u201CWhat can be more touching than this?\u201D\
  \  Oh, my dear friend, it was the cause of the destruction the main purpose of everything:\
  \ Us. In a kind of \u201Cdata show\u201D there was a short movie worldwide with\
  \ many different types of cultures such as India, Brazil, United States of America,\
  \ Europe, etc. And what They have most common: the pleasure of destruction. \nIn\
  \ brief, words have you ever seen how the world is changing? And better, the main\
  \ cause? For sure, you will soon observe that we are the main purpose of everything.\
  \ Hundreds of animals are being killed just for our pleasure of eating a different\
  \ meal, hundreds of natural beaches are being destroyed just because of our pleasure\
  \ of the trash in the beach and not In the adequate place for it. \nDuring all visit,\
  \ I changed my mind about the whole world and that happened when I was looking to\
  \ all images of surfer, horror, and I thought to myself \u201CRio de Janeiro is\
  \ an amazing city! For sure, to show all images of pollution I have no doubts that\
  \ the ocean here is cleaner than all the oceans of the world!!\u201D \nTo my surprise,\
  \ when I left the museum I suddenly saw the Bahia de Guanabara and it appeared to\
  \ me such as trash, and the more and more I looked around there was more and more\
  \ trash everywhere. In just a second, the marine life is being dead by human\u2019\
  s behavior, and soon hundreds of animals will be extinct because of these attitudes!\
  \ I did not expect to find so different places in just one country. I just got confused,\
  \ because in my left there was a museum that all information  to the public about\
  \ the marine pollution, and in my right, there was a \u201Ctrash ocean\u201D \u2013\
  \ This is a kind of \u201CDo what I say, do not do what I do?\u201D, so controversial.\
  \ \nThen, I decided to get closer to that kind of beach and in a question of seconds\
  \ I was capable of picking up plastic bags, drinking glasses, bottles and do not\
  \ matter their quantity They are everywhere. To illustrate the effects of the existence\
  \ of a drinking straw in the ocean, the turtle can perfectly eat it because this\
  \ animal does not know that this is not food. And soon, this animal can die, not\
  \ because the drinking straw but due to our irresponsibility to deal with the trash.\
  \ \nIn other words, the ocean pollution appears to me like a behavior that can the\
  \ controlled, in contrast the role society does not attribute value on the purpose\
  \ of let the nature (mainly ocean nature) be alive by just keeping it safe. \nIn\
  \ conclusion, in this specific travel I did not expect to  have In my hands the\
  \ power of make a distinction between clean, and not clean and with a great example\
  \ in front of me if you look yourself into the mirror, you will probably see what\
  \ I see now, the main purpose of all this trash, you."
