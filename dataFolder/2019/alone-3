Text: "Two years ago, I journeyed across the world to a country much different than\
  \ my own and experienced a moment that would single-handedly alter my outlook on\
  \ travelling for the rest of my life. Up until that moment, I had primarily visited\
  \ western European countries, areas of the world that were quite similar to the\
  \ way of life that I had been accustomed to growing up.  I couldn't see it at the\
  \ time, but as much as I praised myself to be someone who was comfortable with the\
  \ unknown, I hadn't truly allowed myself to actually make that leap. \n\nI was sitting\
  \ at a small cafe that was in the middle of one of the largest open bazaars in Turkey.\
  \ I wasn't alone, next to me was my boyfriend and his family who were animatedly\
  \ talking about all of the places that they wanted to take me to visit. I wasn't\
  \ alone, there were so many people moving around me, going about their day, families,\
  \ children, all moving towards something, and then one of the five daily Muslim\
  \ prayers began from a nearby mosque. I wasn't alone, but in that moment, as I sat\
  \ listening, I had never felt more isolated in my entire life. I didn't know the\
  \ language, I didn't know the culture and I was the furthest away I had ever been\
  \ from home. I felt like an outsider, someone who didn't belong in the mass sea\
  \ of people and I realized that for the first time I was scared of the unknown.\
  \ In a second, everything around me became silent and all I could hear was that\
  \ prayer. The man's deep voice engulfed me and when I shut my eyes to allow the\
  \ feeling to wash over me, I knew I would never be same when I stepped foot off\
  \ of this land.\n\nThis pivotal point in my life became the beginning of a journey\
  \ for me. In that moment, I chose to understand what was happening to me and instead\
  \ of shying away from it and letting it break me down, I chose to rise up and meet\
  \ my fear head on. I realized the power of that experience, the power of being daring\
  \ enough to venture into the unknown, into the wild and experience all that life\
  \ has to offer. I used this moment to fuel my desire of wanting to inspire people,\
  \ to make them believe that there's more to life than numbers, coffee breaks and\
  \ Snapchat; there are entire worlds out there waiting for you to breathe them in\
  \ and make you fall in love. I wanted to show people how travelling can change your\
  \ perspective of the world around you. \n\nTo me, this single moment was my definition\
  \ of the beauty of life and I wonder, if we would all be more open to these types\
  \ of experiences and appreciate the differences in each other, if the world would\
  \ be in a better place. Without even meaning to, that mosque and that prayer inspired\
  \ me to try and re-write peoples' fears of stepping foot outside of what they know\
  \ around them. \n\nSo, my friends, I invite you all to roam free, wander until the\
  \ sun goes down and then jump into the unknown darkness that is the beauty of life.\
  \ I can't promise you that it won't be scary or that it'll never feel lonely, but\
  \ I can promise you that I'll never let go."
