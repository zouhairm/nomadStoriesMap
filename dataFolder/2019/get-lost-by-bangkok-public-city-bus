Text: "It was so much fun exploring Bangkok with public buses.. Not many tourists\
  \ use public city buses in Bangkok, they prefer to ride MRT but I love using them!\
  \ It\u2019s like witnessing the action of the city and the daily life of locals.\
  \ Knowing the habbit and living like local people do. \nThere are many lines and\
  \ numbers of the buses, a bit confusing because of there's no english word on the\
  \ information route but thanks to local people and also google helps a lot! (Hail\
  \ Google!) \U0001F604\nSome buses in Bangkok are free of charge and some buses cost\
  \ a very cheap fare, operated by BMTA (Bangkok state-own bus operator). Some tips\
  \ to know whether the buses are free, there are Red-Cream colour with non air-con\
  \ buses shows a blue sign (in Thai read word only) on their frontscreen, at the\
  \ backscreen and on the sides that literally says (I just know after asking the\
  \ local people and googling, haha!): \u0E23\u0E16\u0E40\u0E21\u0E25\u0E4C\u0E1F\u0E23\
  \u0E35 \u0E08\u0E32\u0E01\u0E20\u0E32\u0E29\u0E35\u0E1B\u0E23\u0E30\u0E0A\u0E32\u0E0A\
  \u0E19 (which means Free buses from public taxes).\nYou will surely find out that\
  \ public transportation in Thailand can be very chaotic and a real adventure. I\
  \ frequently got on a wrong bus, miss my station or get off at the wrong one, get\
  \ stuck in traffic for hours, drive in circles and completely lose your way. And\
  \ to tell the truth, Bangkok is very hot. But beyond that, I could also see parts\
  \ of the town I would have never visited on my own and met interesting people.\n\
  I could meet Bangkok locals like the elder or even the monk going to the temple\
  \ or to the market. Very nice to see the culture there. And I was very lucky to\
  \ be able to watch one of the biggest commemoration in Traditional Thai, Songkran\
  \ Celebration. Every locals were dressed up and going to the temple to pray."
