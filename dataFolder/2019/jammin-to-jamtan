Text: "Traveling to Senegal \n\nAt 3am, surrounded by my four inebriated roommates,\
  \ I bought a one-way ticket from DC to Dakar. I had fallen in love with a girl who\
  \ had recently moved to Michigan and, deciding I could no longer stand to live in\
  \ DC without her, I had called her up only a few hours earlier to tell her that\
  \ either I\u2019d drive up to Michigan the next day to live with her or I\u2019\
  d move to Africa; she said no. \n\nThe following morning I called my father to tell\
  \ him what I\u2019d done, to which he incredulously replied \u201CWhat do you mean\
  \ you\u2019re moving to Africa on Friday? I\u2019m going to the moon tomorrow.\u201D\
  \ After informing my roommates that they\u2019d need to sublet my room, I emailed\
  \ Danny to remind him of the GChat exchange we\u2019d had a few months prior when\
  \ he invited me to visit him in Senegal where he was stationed as a Peace Corps\
  \ Volunteer (PCV). \n\nA few days later Danny was waiting for me just outside the\
  \ gate at the Dakar airport. He had brought along his paramour and the three of\
  \ us dropped off my bag and headed straight off to an embassy party on the beach.\
  \ It was there that I met Julia. This British ex-pat was travelling through West\
  \ Africa on sabbatical from teaching music in a Liverpool suburb. I didn\u2019t\
  \ think much of it until, the following day, while we were touring around N\u2019\
  Gor Island, the former slave embarkation point for the Americas, that her red bikini\
  \ caught my eye. The four of us grabbed lunch and, lacking a cell phone, I gave\
  \ her Danny\u2019s number, told her that we were headed to the Peace Corps Regional\
  \ House in Kolda, and that she should come by if she gets the chance. \n\nIt took\
  \ eight hours to traverse Senegal and The Gambia across fields and over rivers,\
  \ by ferry and by a \u201Csept place\u201D bush taxi (a curious Senegalese innovation\
  \ whereby seven passengers and a driver would cram into a 1977 Peugeot along with\
  \ their luggage, bags of sugar, and chickens). The sept place was stopped twice\
  \ by armed soldiers demanding 5,000 CFA bribes from \u201CToubabs\u201D (white people)\
  \ but we finally made it to Kolda. We arrived a few days before the big party at\
  \ the regional house, giving Danny just enough time for us to bike out to Salamata\
  \ Village and get settled into his one roomed, circular mud hut before we had to\
  \ return for the party. It took two hours to bike the 15 kilometers to his village,\
  \ stopping every 15 minutes to put the pedal back on my bike with a wrench I kept\
  \ in my pocket. \n\nMeals were served three times a day and generally consisted\
  \ of ground birdseed and boiled leaves, known locally as Mafe Lalo. On special occasions\
  \ we got intentionally spoiled milk with tapioca balls or as a treat we were served\
  \ Mafe Guerte (white rice with peanut paste). We quickly began to dream of food\
  \ and made our way back to Kolda for the party. \n\nIn Kolda there was bissap infused\
  \ with rum, palm wine, dibi lamb, and dirty dancing as PCVs got down and shook off\
  \ the dust of two weeks in the villages. The house was always in a state of flux,\
  \ populated by a crowd of PCVs from different regions, NGO staff, visitors, geckos,\
  \ and one cat named Cat who ate the geckos. \n\nJulia showed up unexpectedly the\
  \ morning after the party and, determined not to miss a cultural experience, we\
  \ made our way out to the village for the wedding of a 14 year old girl to a 30\
  \ year old man who could afford a dowry of a few cows to her father. A goat was\
  \ slaughtered, music was blared from a 1980s boom box drawing power from a white\
  \ Toyota pick up truck, and Julia found herself enjoying an entirely new type of\
  \ music. \n\nShe and I travelled throughout the region, she left, I farmed peanuts\
  \ and cotton, there were more parties, my horizons continued to expand, and I eventually\
  \ returned home with my heart full of \u201CJamtan,\u201D Pular for peace only."
