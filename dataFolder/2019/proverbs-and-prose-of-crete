Text: "Passing a white-washed cemetery, flowers abundantly strewn over the fence,\
  \ Velina said that there was a death of an old man in the village yesterday. My\
  \ expression shifted as I offered up my condolences, and she reassured, \u201CIt\u2019\
  s part of life\u2014death is, just as much as life is. It goes.\u201D I listened\
  \ to her wise words as we drove through the lush mountainside. \u201CHis wife yesterday\
  \ at the funeral, she is eighty-five, she began with poetry. It is unique to Cretan\
  \ life, this poetry.\u201D She explained that the words come on the spot, when emotions\
  \ are pouring out like libations and cannot be contained anymore. \u201CThe poems\
  \ gave me like bumps, chills,\u201D she said as she motioned to her arm. \n\t\u201C\
  Goosebumps,\u201D I mouthed.\n\t\u201CAh yes, goosebumps.\u201D \n\tLater on, when\
  \ we were overlooking the lake, I asked Velina again about those Cretan poems. She\
  \ looked out over the water. \u201CIt\u2019s a very beautiful thing and though I\
  \ didn\u2019t know this man well, I became overwhelmed by the poems, feeling the\
  \ love this woman had for her husband. Like that of a twenty-year-old, even though\
  \ sixty-five years have passed.\u201D She explained that Cretans share these poems\
  \ in times of mourning, celebration, elated happiness, and sorrow. Whenever the\
  \ feelings are rising inside, the prose just comes\u2026 The poems are not captured,\
  \ recorded or written down\u2014they are just for the ears of those around; sharing\
  \ the moment, the feeling, together.\n\tThat evening we were invited to Velina\u2019\
  s cousins\u2019 mountain-top dwelling. Unsure of what was in store, we grabbed our\
  \ jackets and the car began to climb the peak. \n\tHigh up on a mountain, we could\
  \ see the Milky Way weaving through the sky and thousands of glittering stars scattered\
  \ about. We met the cousins: traditional Cretan farmers that hand-make their cheese,\
  \ daily. Welcoming us in to their home, we immediately became part of their family,\
  \ which for them, meant greeting us with wine and raki, and inundating us with delicious,\
  \ but simple rations. The night was warm and full of exuberant laughter\u2014all\
  \ within the confines of the cousins\u2019 old sheep farm.\n\tInside the rustic\
  \ stone dwelling, the sunlight dimming outside, one of the cousins took a match\
  \ to the gas lamp... The one gas lamp, hanging from above, that lit the entire room.\
  \ Spirits rising, we toasted to the night, to life, and to family and friends. The\
  \ toasts continued on through the evening as the raki freely poured, and we celebrated\
  \ life. Because what better reason is there to celebrate than living?\n\tPouring\
  \ fresh milk from the cousins\u2019 flock of 900 sheep, we watched in amazement\
  \ as curdles of milk began to congeal and rise to the surface of a large metal pot.\
  \ Both cousins, worn by the sun, had leathery faces and eyes that twinkled in the\
  \ light. For them, this was their good and honest work\u2014making cheese, taking\
  \ care of the animals and living simply off the land, just as their forefathers\
  \ had.\n\tEarlier that afternoon, we had roamed around the family farm where I learned\
  \ to milk goats and taste the sweetness of vegetables straight from the ground.\
  \ I had sheered a sheep, with what seemed like mile-long scissors, trimming away\
  \ her warm coat; I watched as she relaxed on the ground, thankful to be shedding\
  \ the layers of winter and feeling renewed. We talked about living simply and with\
  \ what the ground provided.\n\tMy heart began to jump for joy as I felt my soul\
  \ becoming one with the earth. Velina reminded me that, \u201CWe come from nature\
  \ and we are of nature, so when we are not in it\u2014we are lost.\u201D Hours later,\
  \ we were sitting high up in the mountain, tasting the products of this labor of\
  \ love\u2014warm, fresh cheese, unlike anything I\u2019d ever tasted before. Those\
  \ Cretan poems began to flow from the mouths of our company, and I joyously listened,\
  \ not understanding a word, but understanding the meaning: the communal feeling\
  \ amid the incandescent light."
