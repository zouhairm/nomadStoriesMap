Text: "On a Christmas Eve in Da Lat, Vietnam, I was enjoying the holiday as best as\
  \ I could in a beautiful hostel called Cozy Nook. After a night of adventuring through\
  \ this small hillside town, a group of backpackers end up celebrating Christmas\
  \ at a horrible electronic club. In a drunken haze, I asked some man that I saw\
  \ at the hostel \u201Cwill you be my Christmas kiss?\u201D Something about this\
  \ kiss turned into 1 year of building a \u2018twin flame relationship.\u2019 The\
  \ next year consisted of love, failure, infidelity, cheating, running and chasing.\
  \ We visited 4 countries together then decided to split up because we weren\u2019\
  t growing with a safety blanket. When he left to go home to London, I chased after\
  \ him to London where I tried to assimilate to a new country, but in the end we\
  \ broke up on the following Christmas. I tried to find ways to blame him, but in\
  \ reality it was just me. It was my own insecurities, my inability to make decisions,\
  \ and trying to fill my cup up with his cup. He\u2019s depleted from trying to help\
  \ me with all my problems. I was alone and depressed. I questioned every decision\
  \ I made in the last year, reflected on how my life would be different if I changed\
  \ one tiny detail. Living in the past and regretting decisions I didn\u2019t make\
  \ won\u2019t help me feel any better about my current situation. It is a story of\
  \ growth, struggle, anxiety, and most importantly unconditional love."
