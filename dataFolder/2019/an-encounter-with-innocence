Text: "It was a little past noon when I made my way down a dirt road in Bagan. The\
  \ day was hot and humid and very few people were on the streets. Everyone sought\
  \ sanctuary from the merciless heat inside their homes, in cafes or in temples.\
  \ The air was still and so quiet I could hear my footsteps, kicking up dust from\
  \ the dry dirt road. I looked up and in front of me the sagely Ananda temple with\
  \ a gilded sikhara stood majestically against the clear blue sky. Dark, grayish\
  \ mold thrived on its exterior walls, covering most but for some parts revealing\
  \ to visitors that it was once white.\n\nAs I removed my shoes and entered the temple,\
  \ it was almost like walking into a different world. The air turned cool and the\
  \ quietness was broken down by echoes of whispers from tourists inside the walls.\
  \ My warm, dusty feet took appreciation in the soothingly cold stone floor. This\
  \ was my second visit. Without a second to waste, I scurried down the hall to the\
  \ center room, where four large Buddha statues stood, facing the four cardinal directions.\
  \ I briskly walked along the hallway that ran around the center room, sometimes\
  \ having to turn sideways to go through groups of people who were blocking the corridor,\
  \ rightfully, admiring its architecture. I was looking for Wei Wei.\n\nI met Wei\
  \ Wei in 2011 when I traveled to Myanmar for the first time. He was sitting on the\
  \ floor of Ananda Phaya, reading an English grammar book, when I walked in with\
  \ my friend. When he saw us, he quickly got up, introduced himself and asked if\
  \ we could let him show us around the temple. \u201CI want to practice English,\u201D\
  \ he said with hopeful eyes. Hearing stories about scams and with my fair share\
  \ of experiences being scammed while travelling, naturally my first instinct would\
  \ be to decline his offer. But for some reason, albeit a little hesitant, we agreed.\
  \ That decision changed my life.\n\nThrough Wei Wei, I learned that the Burmese\
  \ were an adamant bunch when it came to learning, especially in learning English.\
  \ He wanted to go to university but he could not afford it and so, he would come\
  \ to Ananda Phaya, where his mother operates a stall selling lacquerware, every\
  \ day with an English book in his hand. Wei Wei was a good guide. He narrated the\
  \ history of the temple and showed us small features of carvings on the walls which\
  \ would otherwise go unnoticed. We bade goodbye at a hallway that leads out to a\
  \ row of souvenir stalls. Before we left, he said something that I would remember\
  \ for a long time. \u201CDown there is my mother\u2019s shop. You don\u2019t have\
  \ to buy, just see is OK.\u201D There was no scam. He just wanted to practice his\
  \ English. For a moment, his naivety crumbled the wall of apprehension around me.\
  \ \n\nI went back to my hostel that afternoon with some of his innocence sticking\
  \ on me. I was humbled by his determination and kindness. On the evening of my last\
  \ day in Bagan, I sat waiting for my bus on a stone bench in front of the hostel.\
  \ The hostel receptionist offered to wait with me. Sitting next to me, he said,\
  \ \u201CNot many people come here. I\u2019m happy I get to speak English today.\u201D\
  \ My bus eventually arrived and I got on with a heavy heart, resolving to return\
  \ one day, to teach English. \n\nI stood on the south corner of the temple and I\
  \ looked up to see a statue of Buddha smiling down on me. I knew that the smile\
  \ would fade if I stood further away. I had learned that from Wei Wei. I wanted\
  \ to thank him for what he had shared with me that fateful day but he was nowhere\
  \ to be seen. I hope he has found his way to college."
