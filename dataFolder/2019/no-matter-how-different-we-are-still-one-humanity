Text: "The night before my journey, my dad said \u201C now Mari, I know how you always\
  \ like to explore but India can be quite dangerous. Please stay with the tour guide\u201D\
  . He always gives me goodbye speeches on safety measure before travelling. Little\
  \ he knew about What I was going to encounter. I was well behaved this time, I stayed\
  \ with the tour during my stay. I travelled with my friends and the tour guide to\
  \ three cities of Jaypour, Agra and Dehli. The words can not describe the hidden\
  \ beauties in that country. From colourful cloths to exotic food; breathtaking mansions\
  \ to ancient palaces. On the last day my friends were going to visit The Lupus temple\
  \ in Dehli. They hired a mini bus to take them there. However I really wanted to\
  \ visit the Swaminarayan Akshardham temple. My travel book said that\u2019s the\
  \ most beautiful temple in all Dehli. I welcomed the danger of being raped or kidnapped.\
  \ The hotel reception helped me hire a took-took to the train station. For those\
  \ of you who don\u2019t know what took took is; it\u2019s motorbike or a bike carrying\
  \ a carriage with you in it. It\u2019s atterly dangerous means of transport  In\
  \ most chayotic streets of India, but most fun. I was enjoying the wind in my hair\
  \ and sun on my face, when I noticed the took-took is going off-road. It seemed\
  \ the driver did not understand any English. I told him to stop. He was mumbling\
  \ something and going even faster! I jumped up and that seemed to alarm him. Eventually\
  \ he stopped and I noticed the station. Relieved but with my heart in my mouth;\
  \ I paid him and jumped off the took-took. I quickly got into station. I was lucky\
  \ to find a girl in a crowed to direct me to the temple. I walked from station to\
  \ temple. I simply followed the crowed! No means of belonging were allowed into\
  \ the temple. Whilst I was handing my bags I noticed dark featured good looking\
  \ young gentlemen. He noticed me too. By my surprise, he walked towards me and said\
  \ \u201C it seems you are visiting the temple alone, may I accompany you through\
  \ your visit\u201D. Before even thinking about it, the word yes jumped out of my\
  \ mouth. He smiled. I was cursing myself for talking and walking with a stranger.\
  \ Before I know it, we started to talk about our most personal matters.He kept me\
  \ close, guarding me from the crowd.  He explained he is from Israel. This was his\
  \ first trip out of tel viv. He said he is single, he practice judisem, he only\
  \ eats kosher meat. While travelling he only consumed vegetables. He carried his\
  \ belongies on his backpack. I told him I am from Iran, I travel a lot. I explained\
  \ I am Muslim and I\u2019m supposed to only eat Halal but I don\u2019t practice\
  \ Islam. He then said why a pretty girl like you travels alone. My heart ached from\
  \ scars of my previous relationships. I said \u201C i haven\u2019t meet the one\
  \ yet!\u201D He looked at me and said \u201C hold on girl I\u2019m sure you soon\
  \ will\u201D, he then held my hands. I didn\u2019t pull back, it was strange but\
  \ familiar. He said: he wanted to have many kids. I said: I love to have three children.\
  \ By then we finished looking at the temple. We were walking in the garden, he then\
  \ stopped, looked at me and said \u201C Mari you will come here one day with your\
  \ children; they play in the garden, you will remember me.\u201D I never meet Israeli\
  \ boy and he never meet Iranian girl. Our countries were enemies before we were\
  \ born. I found him far nicer and genuine that any other boy I ever meet. We finished\
  \ the temple. His warm body touching mine, we got our stuff. He walked me to station,\
  \ still holding my hands. He gave me tight goodbye huge as if he knew me for centuries.\
  \ I walked into station and got on the train. Surprisingly I saw the same girl who\
  \ direct me to the temple. \u201C Did you like the temple?\u201D She asked. \u201C\
  \ I leaped into the unknown\u201D I said..."
