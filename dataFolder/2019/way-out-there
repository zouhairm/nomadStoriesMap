Text: "West Texas isn\u2019t the first place I bring up when people ask where I\u2019\
  ve traveled. They want to know about castle-hopping in Slovakia or wielding machetes\
  \ in Costa Rica. I recount tasting macarons in Saint-Denis or surfing virgin beaches\
  \ in Asilah. But at the base of these stories is the unyielding, magnificent desert\
  \ of my childhood state. The American Southwest will not be suppressed.\n\nIt was\
  \ appropriate I was driving seven hours for a quick getaway. As I tell non-natives,\
  \ once you\u2019re in Texas, you are in Texas, even a visit to grandma\u2019s can\
  \ take nine hours. But despite the challenges of road-tripping with full-time jobs\
  \ and university deadlines, we couldn\u2019t pass up camping in Big Bend National\
  \ Park. \n\nI was journeying with friends from formative points in my life. I\u2019\
  d met Emily studying in Costa Rica when we\u2019d bonded over cafecitos, gallo pinto\
  \ and a shared habit of seeing weird things on the street no else did. \u201CDid\
  \ you see that truck with life-size wooden giraffes?\u201D I shouted as we wandered\
  \ around San Jos\xE9. Only Emily noticed. We hadn\u2019t hung out in years, but\
  \ when Emily mentioned a trip to Big Bend, we started scheming. Now we were on our\
  \ way, packed in my friend Kayla\u2019s jeep covered in \xA1Viva Terlingua! stickers.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019d met Kayla six months earlier, and we joked this trip was our anniversary.\
  \ We\u2019d applied to be Texas State Park Ambassadors with a program that paired\
  \ young adults with parks in their area. I was set up with McKinney Falls in Austin\
  \ while Kayla was assigned Davis Mountains in West Texas. We fell into friendship\
  \ naturally, and people asked if we\u2019d known each other before. We just seemed\
  \ to be headed the same way. \n\nWe started in Austin, a site originally named Waterloo,\
  \ seen today in businesses like Waterloo Records. But that\u2019s the white history.\
  \ Evidence of inhabitants in the Balcones Escarpment can be traced 11,000 years\
  \ earlier, and the area was populated by various indigenous tribes including the\
  \ Tonkawa, Comanches and Lipan Apaches. The name \u201CTexas\u201D comes from a\
  \ Hasinai word meaning friendship. Despite the hype surrounding Don\u2019t mess\
  \ with Texas, \u201CFriendship\u201D is our real motto, and you\u2019ll find it\
  \ everywhere in the expansive state. We left the Hill Country, passed through Sonora,\
  \ with its caverns, and made it to Fort Stockton, our last chance for nourishment\
  \ before the desert. The only way to freshen up out here was a visit to Balmorhea,\
  \ the world\u2019s largest artesian spring-fed pool and the last oasis for miles.\
  \ \n\nOur first stop was Davis Mountains State Park, where Kayla and I met six months\
  \ earlier. Our plan included wandering the backcountry, where last time we almost\
  \ didn\u2019t pack enough water to make it home, but it was worth it for the panoramas.\
  \ Next, we viewed the universe through the high-powered telescopes at McDonald Observatory,\
  \ part of the International Dark Sky Community. The Observatory hosted its Star\
  \ Party, where we gawked at the Orion Nebula, a star nursery in a hero\u2019s knife,\
  \ where baby stars are born. We drove to see Kayla\u2019s parents in Alpine, a cute\
  \ town at the foot of the mountains with local bookshops and unfussy vibes. We discovered\
  \ the haunted charm of Terlingua Ghost Town, which hosts a chilifest, and sampled\
  \ the world-famous chili at the Starlight Theatre. We explored Marfa, a town lighting\
  \ the landscape with otherworldly orbs and keeping hipsters content with unconventional\
  \ art. Finally, it was time for Big Bend, where the views over Santa Elena Canyon\
  \ hugged the Mexican border and spoke of exalted, unbarred boundaries. \n\nWest\
  \ Texas is not a wildly popular tourist destination. People wonder why anyone would\
  \ subject themselves to ennui and dust. I get that, but I must disagree. Unruly\
  \ and volatile, Texas is a passel of contradictions: irreverent but holy, relentless\
  \ but forgiving. It dares you to surrender and welcomes with open arms when you\
  \ do. \n\nIt took a while to understand why I like travel. I wanted to wander across\
  \ continents to encounter culture or explore the human condition. Now I see the\
  \ necessity of movement begins at home. Anyone can discover their story, mine was\
  \ in the familiar trails of Texas all along."
