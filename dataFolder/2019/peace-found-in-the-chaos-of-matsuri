Text: "\u201CHere is the updated plan for a Tohoku road trip from August 1-5 if you\
  \ are interested\u201D \n\nWhen this message popped up on my screen as I was scarfing\
  \ down my lunch last March, I can say with confidence that I:\n1. Had no recollection\
  \ of agreeing to a road trip, \n2. was entirely unaware of where Tohoku was, and\
  \ \n3. was definitely interested.\n\nCut to August: I crowded into a car for six\
  \ hours with my friends Janae and Kaylyn. The dulcet tones of the sputtering air\
  \ conditioner, the NHK English education hour and cicadas slamming into the front\
  \ windshield lulling me to sleep. Tohoku, as I learned embarrassingly late, is the\
  \ northeastern region of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. Tohoku is composed\
  \ of Akita, Fukushima, Iwate, Miyagi, Yamagata, and Aomori, our destination. Far\
  \ from the Technicolor dreamland that is Tokyo or the traditional surreality of\
  \ Kyoto, Tohoku is known for its\u2019 hot springs, mountainous landscapes, and\
  \ harsh winters. It\u2019s a place where the people find their peace through living\
  \ well\u2014a peace we hoped to share in.\n\nWe were on a mission to the Nebuta\
  \ Matsuri, an annual six-night Tanabata festival featuring a parade of massive washi\
  \ paper and wire lantern floats, traditional taiko drum performances, and numerous\
  \ musicians and dancers. Our hope was to arrive in time to see the festival\u2019\
  s first night of splendor. \n\nAomori City is famous for the distinctive flavor\
  \ of its local Miso Curry Milk ramen and it\u2019s practically unheard of to visit\
  \ the city without trying some. However, for three girls just off a six-hour car\
  \ ride, the restaurant\u2019s hourlong wait wasn\u2019t quite feasible and we resolved\
  \ to come back the next day for lunch. \n\nAfter a downtown stroll the next morning,\
  \ we found ourselves back in the Aji no Sapporo Onishi line with a mix of tourists\
  \ and office workers, blocking the sun with our hands and catching faint whiffs\
  \ of spice every time the door cracked open. As we were briskly ushered in to the\
  \ lightly air-conditioned shop, sounds of sizzling vegetables, low lunchtime chatter,\
  \ and the telltale slurps of ramen shops engulfed us. Eagerly accepting glasses\
  \ of water, we placed our order: three bowls of the Miso Curry Milk ramen kudasai.\
  \ \n\nMinutes later, three generous bowls with large pads of butter on top were\
  \ placed in front of us. After some necessary adjustments (Kaylyn\u2019s seaweed\
  \ into my bowl, my roasted pork into Janae\u2019s), we were ready. Our cautious\
  \ sips were rewarded with an exciting, complex flavor\u2014the typically strong\
  \ taste of curry was mellowed out by the milk, the tang of miso brought up the rear,\
  \ balanced by the butter and the noodles\u2019 freshness. It was delicious, but\
  \ confusing. Before I knew it, my bowl was empty, and I still wasn\u2019t sure why\
  \ or how these flavors worked together. \n\nFrom the shop we hurried to catch sight\
  \ of the floats before their evening debut. After taking the obligatory tourist\
  \ photos, being interviewed by a local radio station, and breaking for ice cream,\
  \ we made our way to the parade route. Much to the chagrin of a police officer (with\
  \ the most amazing posture I\u2019ve ever seen), we parked ourselves next to a main\
  \ crosswalk and resolved to stay put. Luck and the kindness of strangers decided\
  \ otherwise. My friend Kaylyn vanished to speak to a middle-aged Japanese gentleman\
  \ and moments later, we were upgraded to three front-row corner seats.\n\nThe streets\
  \ overflowed with excited faces as food stall aromas wafted over and floats wheeled\
  \ into place. Seven o\u2019clock struck, a rumbling chatter ran through the crowd,\
  \ the first chants of \u201CRassera, Rassera\u201D began.  \n\nFloats weaved down\
  \ the road with teams of people pushing them back and forth and around as whistles\
  \ directed them. Scores of taiko drummers, cymbal players, singers and chanters\
  \ filled the air with sound, followed by hundreds of haneto dancers. As one after\
  \ another went by, the procession of dazzling floats seemed infinite. Participants\
  \ tossed treats and trinkets. A topless flautist gave us a personal performance.\
  \ Sights and sounds, smells and smiles, merged to form a euphoric scene. I felt\
  \ the peace that Tohoku is known for.\n\nI was even more interested."
