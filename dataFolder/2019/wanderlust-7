Text: "It\u2019s my last day in Thailand. I spent six nights in Koh Samui at a five\
  \ star resort with an ex, and three nights el cheapo styles in Bangkok, alone. Or\
  \ as a fellow New Zealander I met on a boat trip referred to this energetic, delicious,\
  \ snarling metropolis: Bangers. My hotel is steps away from chaotic Asoke intersection\
  \ which is choked with scooters, tuk tuks, and taxis that take traffic signals as\
  \ suggestions only. I\u2019m in love with the massive shopping mall, Terminal 21,\
  \ designed to look like an airport with each floor named after different parts of\
  \ the world. I spend a lot of time inside this air conditioned consumer wet dream,\
  \ constantly snacking.\n\nI decide to have a night out, and head to Soi Cowboy,\
  \ a short pink and red neon-lit street packed with go go bars. A friend suggested\
  \ I head to trendy Thonglor instead because its nicer, but I feel like some red-light\
  \ realness. I stroll around looking for a place to hang out. Suzie Wongs, Deja Vu,\
  \ Kiss, The Dollhouse\u2026 Clusters of scantily clad women mill around, waiting\
  \ for business. I sit down outside at a bar called Lighthouse, and a woman with\
  \ a worn face sidles up and says \u201CDrink for me?\u201D She is wearing a white\
  \ strapless cocktail dress with a sweetheart neckline. It has some lace on it and\
  \ looks kinda 80s, like something Molly Ringwald would wear to the prom.\n\tI could\
  \ use some company, so I motion for her to sit, and light her cigarette. From my\
  \ hostessing days in Tokyo I know her drinks will be more expensive than mine and\
  \ that she is trying to make a little extra cash at the beginning of the night until\
  \ she gets a real customer. I wonder if she is a prostitute, as she isn\u2019t dressed\
  \ like a go go dancer or hostess and looks older than the other women. She tells\
  \ me her name is Nong, and that at 40, she is an old lady. She laughs when I tell\
  \ her that I am 44. Nong makes a joke in broken English that I think is about anal\
  \ sex because she acts it out. I chuckle along to be polite. A dancer sits down\
  \ and asks for a drink too. She has light eyes and honey colored hair. I check the\
  \ price first, and agree. Nong tells her friend that I am 44, and the friend says\
  \ that Nong looks ten years older than me, which makes me feel a bit sorry for her.\
  \ \n\t\u2018Why you look so young?\u2019 she asks.\n\t\u2018Because my mind like\
  \ child,\u2019 I say, and tap the side of my head. I doubt she would know the word\
  \ \u2018immature.\u2019 \n\tWe discuss Thai boob jobs, and the dancer invites me\
  \ to feel her fake breasts. They are very soft. I ask where the bathroom is and\
  \ Nong takes me inside, where a UV-lit stage is packed with young women dressed\
  \ in white bikinis wearing numbers. She leads me upstairs, where the floor is glass\
  \ and you can look down at the girls on stage below. I try to surreptitiously take\
  \ a picture through the glass but Nong catches me. I feel bad, like a sleazy farang,\
  \ and offer to delete it from my phone.\n\t\u201CIt\u2019s okay,\u201D she says.\
  \ \u201CNo one see. You my VIP.\u201D"
