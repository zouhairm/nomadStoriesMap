Text: "One spring day in Austin, Tx I randomly met a tall, handsome Kiwi man who was\
  \ in town from New Zealand for work. There was immediate chemistry and he prolonged\
  \ his stay for an extra week. After he flew back to New Zealand I didn't think I\
  \ would see him again. But not long after that he flew me to his country for a two-week\
  \ visit. For two years we continued to fly back and forth. Towards the end of the\
  \ last year I sold my car, all of my personal belongings except for clothes and\
  \ a few things I couldn't part with, moved out of my duplex and into my parents'\
  \ house, and told the school I taught at that I wouldn't be returning the following\
  \ year. In December of 2016 I moved to Auckland, New Zealand. It's so different\
  \ here. It's winter in August and summer in February. There are hardly any Mexican\
  \ restaurants and the ones that do exist don't really know how to make a taco. Air\
  \ conditioning and heating in the home is considered a luxury. And New Zealanders\
  \ have a dry, humour that I don't get and they often don't understand my humour\
  \ which is usually in the form of sarcasm and self-deprecation. It rains A LOT and\
  \ the UV index is so high that the sun can burn you in a matter of minutes. \nBut\
  \ I've never seen how brilliant a sunny, and blue-skied day could be until I moved\
  \ to Auckland. I can see the harbour and the sailboats from my house. The green,\
  \ rolling hills out in the country can make you feel like you actually might see\
  \ a hobbit ambling along. There are beaches less than twenty minutes from my house\
  \ in any direction; surf beaches with giant, crashing waves and peaceful, child-friendly\
  \ beaches with quiet waters. My partner and I drove to the northern-most tip of\
  \ New Zealand, Cape Reinga, where you can stand on the high cliffs and see where\
  \ the Pacific and Tasman Sea meet. People here are mostly friendly and enjoy a quiet\
  \ life. I get to learn about, and often times experience, the culture of the Maori\
  \ people, a group I knew virtually nothing about before moving here. \nMy partner\
  \ and I travel around the country as much as we can and we've made it back to the\
  \ States for Christmas a few times. But mostly we have a quiet life. We both work.\
  \ On the weekends we get out and explore or go hang out with friends. We go to the\
  \ gym regularly and a yoga studio has FINALLY opened up in the neighborhood. I walk\
  \ to work and my partner rides his bike. \n Often time on a Saturday night I'll\
  \ be in the kitchen making tortillas or baking something and singing along to whatever\
  \ music is on and I'll look at my partner who is playing a video game or watching\
  \ TV and I'll think, \"I can't believe I'm here. What random, unexpected, crazy\
  \ changes our life can have.\""
