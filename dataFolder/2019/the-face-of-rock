Text: "Suburbia is exotic, I realize, for the urban dweller. The quiet, curved neighborhood\
  \ streets of Riverdale are alien to a New York City block. Colonial-style houses\
  \ enveloped in shiny white vinyl siding or dull, steak-red brick sit back on slopes\
  \ of grass, the gray light of the clouded sky reflecting silver off of the windows.\
  \ The lawns roll out towards the road like long carpets, instead of small brownfields\
  \ pitied between apartments and brownstone townhouses. The long drone of cicadas\
  \ and the eerie creaking of birds echo from the copse of dogwood and gorse. The\
  \ neighborhood is almost empty. A father and son pass on the opposite side of the\
  \ street, heads lowered underneath wide-brimmed hats. They subsume into Spaulding\
  \ Lane. The houses, enclosed by white fences, frayed with dirt and chipped paint,\
  \ look abandoned. Suburbia, actually, is eerie. The neighborhood rounds out to a\
  \ lawn on top of the Hudson River, and drops down into cliffs that lean down into\
  \ the river water, the rocks gathering in craggy hills at the base of the mountain\
  \ wall. Silver light hits the muddied river water, reflecting green, and on its\
  \ kaleidoscope surface, a canoe sails next to a pittering swimmer, a red swimming\
  \ cap skipping in and out of the water like a buoy. They dissolve beyond the wall\
  \ of cliffs. The face of rocks never changes. Layers of hardened sand, fragmented\
  \ silt, and blackened mud. Beds of sandstone where the water inflates and recedes.\
  \ A coating of shale. The hereditary code of rock. Perched on the edge of cliffs\
  \ like a bird on a branch, the rock face of Inishmore stares blankly into the sky.\
  \ My aunt Brighid, once, sat back in her floral armchair, a teacup perched in the\
  \ palm of her hand, and narrated the history of Inishmore, one of three of the Aran\
  \ Islands in the mouth of Galway Bay. Brighid says the isle looks abandoned, with\
  \ a network of pre-century cottages and dirt roads. But residents gather together\
  \ in the one-roomed school and the dark pub with only one beer on tap. They drive\
  \ wagons of people with horses and ponies. A converted warehouse holds a museum\
  \ of prints, artifacts, and paintings. The lacework of small, hand-built walls encloses\
  \ livestock of cows, chickens, and pigs. Where the pavement has shattered into gravel,\
  \ arctic, Mediterranean and alpine plants side by side. An ancient language and\
  \ culture live on. Unconformity preserves the face of rocks. An older face of rock\
  \ is exposed to erosion for a period of time before the deposition of the younger\
  \ face continues. A buried weathering that separates two rock masses of different\
  \ ages. Gaps in the geologic record. \nThe air is stirring; the wind conducts itself\
  \ restlessly through low hanging flowers and tree branches. I have walked to the\
  \ edge of the cliffs on the Hudson River, and stare down into the gap of the river.\
  \ All rivers and floods seek out the ocean. If I jump into the river water, I would\
  \ swim to the Irish Sea."
