Text: "When you travel you experience other people and other cultures. In every sense,\
  \ it broadens your horizons and makes you more capable of accepting others for who\
  \ they are! \nIn Scotland you can see these really small creatures - something like\
  \ a slug. Yesterday I was watching one of them eating a leaf on the ground. It was\
  \ eating the leaf so slow and it was naturally in peace with its own self! My point\
  \ is - there are thousands of creatures that you can have connection with, not only\
  \ humans.\nOn one of my trips to Bulgaria I experienced something wonderful! \n\
  I climbed mountains and peaks. I went down through the Devil's staircase to the\
  \ Devil's throath. I fed horses. I spoke with sheep. I observed water running fast.\
  \ I listened the birds. I watched the smallest creatures. I looked at a frog's eyes.\
  \ The frog looked back at my eyes. I heard a lot of stories! I met my destiny! I\
  \ was an eagle. I laughed. A deer crossed my path. A rabbit jumped over my way.\
  \ I was a friend. I had friends. I watched a storm blowing out the sky! I got burned\
  \ by the sun, wet by a rainshower, I was sliding down a hill and fell in a mud-snow\
  \ paddle! \nI was me, myself and I and who I wanted to be! \nMoments like this make\
  \ me feel so inspired to be the change I wish to see in the world! Because I realize\
  \ there is so much more than everything we are used to see and to do everyday!"
