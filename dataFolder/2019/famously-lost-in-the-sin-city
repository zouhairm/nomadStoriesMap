  \ I thought to myself as the plane lifted itself off the runway. \n\n \u201CFinally,\
  \ on my way to a real fancy city,\u201D I said to my mom. Who of course, gives me\
  \ the usual run down on the rules in her helicopter mom like manner: \u201CNow,\
  \ Kyle when we get to the airport, I know you wanna see all the celebrities, but\
  \ you have to stay by me the whole time. A lot of weirdos,\u201D she whispered,\
  \ as she was afraid it would offend those around us. \n\n  After, what seems to\
  \ be the slowest hour and a half of my life. We arrived. The wide eye puppy dog\
  \ look doesn\u2019t begin to describe the excitement that ran through my body. The\
  \ lights, the billboards, the enterages, and I haven\u2019t even left the airport.\
  \ I started looking around seeing if I could spot anybody famous, while my moms\
  \ trailing me around doing the usual \u201C we made it\u201D texts on her phone\
  \ to all of our friends and family. \n\nFiguring I could cover a lot more ground\
  \ if I just went venturing off even though I have 40 minutes to get to the next\
  \ flight. I told her I had to use the bathroom and that I would meet her over by\
  \ the slot machines- she noddingly agreed as she was hoping to be able to play them\
  \ without having her 16 year old son trail her around. \n\n\nSo, without mom I set\
  \ off on my mission. My mission was to find a celebrity to take a photo with that\
  \ everybody back home would know of. I looked everywhere in the airport- the trolleys,\
  \ bathrooms, luggage reclaim area, even walking outside checking for limos. Couldn\u2019\
  t spot anybody famous that I knew of, so kicking rocks. I went back inside, where\
  \ I had to go through security. \n\n\n  At this point, I start to panic because\
  \ being so eager and dedicated to accomplishing my mission, I realized my mom is\
  \ by the terminal waiting on me with my ID and ticket. So after a long and what\
  \ seemed then to be a pointless chat, I see my mom appearing out of sea of people\
  \ leaving the trolley. \u201CMom!\u201D I said. \u201CI don\u2019t wanna hear it,\
  \ Kyle! I told you to stay by me!\u201D We showed the security my information and\
  \ went through the security check in fear that we was gonna miss the flight we ran\
  \ back to the terminal.\n\n  After arriving to the terminal, my mom asked,\u201D\
  \ did you at least get a picture like you wanted?\u201D Saddened and disappointed\
  \ in myself, I looked down and nodded no. \u201CWell, look around we still have\
  \ a few minutes before we have to board the plane. \n\n\n  So I jumped up, hoping\
  \ over and beyond that I would see any recognizable face. I\u2019m scanning the\
  \ rooms and restaurants, when all of a sudden I focus on on a young woman\u2019\
  s face. She\u2019s wearing a hot pink hoodie, nerdy black reading glasses, and she\
  \ has her hair up. I stopped dead in my tracks because she looks just like Britney\
  \ Spears. As I looked closer, I realized it\u2019s not Britney Spears but her sister\
  \ Jamie Spears. I remember thinking to myself at the time like \u201Cwow, I made\
  \ it!\u201D As I began to approach her I started to think of how I was gonna ask\
  \ her to take a picture with me, when she looked up and made eye contact with me.\
  \ \n\n  At this point, I smile because I\u2019m about to approach her table eagerly\
  \ when she makes a face of disgust and ill-feelings. Literally, looking me dead\
  \ in the eye while making the \u201Cdon\u2019t disturb me face,\u201D I smiled nicely\
  \ and walked off. When I was loading onto the plane, my mom asked again, \u201C\
  did you accomplish what you set out to do?\u201D I simply replied, \u201Cyep, met\
  \ a real celebrity.\u201D"
