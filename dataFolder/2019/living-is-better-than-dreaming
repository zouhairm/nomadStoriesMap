Text: "living is better than dreaming.\n  Yes, living is better than dreaming, and\
  \ the feeling of turning a dream into a reality is incredible and unforgettable.\
  \ now I'm going to tell the day when I could feel on my skin this wonderful feeling\
  \ of living a dream. Well, before I start telling the details of the story, it's\
  \ important to note that I was only 6 years old, yes 6 years old, and this trip\
  \ was so incredible that I keep the memories that my eyes have photographed to this\
  \ day.\nIt all started with a cold, rainy night, lightning and thunder were my company\
  \ that day. I was tired of feeling my body trembling with cold, all I wanted was\
  \ to feel the skin burning in the sun's rays haha, my dream was to know the beach,\
  \ feel the waves coming and going at my feet, feel the wind breeze swaying hair,\
  \ I was only 6 years old and I never set foot on those sands that only the beach\
  \ has, the same night I told my parents about my dream, they promised to take me\
  \ to the beach when summer came! I remember I was so happy that I could not even\
  \ sleep that night thinking about the beach, the sea, the sun in every detail.Until\
  \ summer has finally arrived! I woke up with my mother calling me to prepare a suitcase\
  \ that we would go to the beach! it was a distant beach, it was inside where my\
  \ aunts lived, it was the most incredible three hours of my life. on the glass of\
  \ the car, watching the way, I felt the feeling that I was finally living a dream,\
  \ I watched every second on the way to the beach, when I arrived at the beach, I\
  \ did not believe what my eyes were photographing! I saw the sea, it was beautiful,\
  \ blue, the first few minutes when I stepped on the sand of that beautiful beach\
  \ I just admired the beauty of the beautiful landscape, I closed my eyes for 10\
  \ seconds, the wind shook my hair, I just wanted to feel that my dreams finally\
  \ were reality, did I feel that I was making a connection with local knowledge?\
  \ Like a d\xE9j\xE0 vu like I was already there.Lastly, the best part was on the\
  \ way to the sea, my feet almost sank into that white sand, the winds were shaking\
  \ my hair and my connection to the beach only increases, when my feet touched the\
  \ sea, I was sure no doubt living is better than dreaming! This was my first time\
  \ at the beach, I brought with me memories that no camera could capture, that was\
  \ my local connection."
