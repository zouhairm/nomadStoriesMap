Text: "I got expelled from university and was too scared and still am too scared to\
  \ tell my family. Instead, I decided to travel to the Dominican Republic.\n\n Here\
  \ I\u2019ve met the friendliest, most interesting and free thinking people I ever\
  \ came across in my life. These encounters range from a 24 year old planning to\
  \ travel to all the countries in the world and having covered 57 so far to a 70\
  \ year old man who travels half the year and stil gets robbed by hookers. \n\nSome\
  \ of these people have inspired me and mentored me greatly, especially in Macao\
  \ where I met Andreas and Mariella, a very well educated couple who gave up the\
  \ corporate life and its \u2018pleasures\u2019 and ended up living in the mountains.\
  \ Jose, an electrical engineer turned kite surfer instructor is no less an inspiration\
  \ than the aforementioned. \n\nAside from the amazing people, the dance and musical\
  \ culture is phenomenal in DR. Going to a bar or party (fiesta as they call it)\
  \ is like being in a Flash Mob scene in Dirty Dancing but better. The dancing is\
  \ sensual, oozing with sexual vibes and innuendo but still very respectful. I know\
  \ very paradoxical, innit. You\u2019d have to see for yourself to believe it. You\
  \ can feel the salsa just by watching it and even get a little bit dizzy from all\
  \ the spins. I am yet to learn the bachata or salsa, however, my imagination is\
  \ a master of the craft. \n\nI am yet, to come out to my family that I got expelled\
  \ from university. Some of them still talk of a graduation. Don\u2019t feel bad\
  \ for laughing, even I laugh at The sheer irony of it. It\u2019s a laughable situation.\
  \ Come July, someone\u2019s going to be disappointed and I am hoping that won\u2019\
  t be me so I better find my passion now. Maybe it\u2019s writing? For now I\u2019\
  ll have a shot of rum and watch people salsa."
