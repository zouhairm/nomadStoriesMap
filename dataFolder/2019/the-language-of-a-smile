Text: "It was my first time out of the country and after spending three weeks working\
  \ with a group of WWOOF volunteers on an organic vegetable farm situated in the\
  \ picturesque English countryside, I now found myself in Lisbon, Portugal... broke\
  \ and alone. Almost immediately upon my arrival to this fragrant city of a half\
  \ million people, it began to pour. As I searched frantically for my heavily soiled\
  \ rain jacket that I know I tucked into the front zip pocket of my backpack, it\
  \ began to dawn on me that someone had stolen it from my pack, along with my Nalgene\
  \ water bottle plastered with band stickers, somewhere between Heathrow and here.\
  \ I begrudgingly purchased an overpriced umbrella from an airport gift shop and\
  \ proceeded to hail a cab. My flight landed in Lisbon around 3 am and I didn't feel\
  \ comfortable navigating public transportation at this time of night... as a solo\
  \ female traveler... in a country whose language I didn't speak. \n\nThe arrival\
  \ to my hostile left me lying in bed feeling unsure and a bit disappointed. The\
  \ streets smelled of garbage and the toilet (and bidet!) were in the middle of my\
  \ room; no walls! The paper thin mattress had me empathizing with the princess who\
  \ could indeed feel the pea. But travel exhaustion took over and I managed to sleep\
  \ well into the next day. \n\nAs I set out from the hostile that first afternoon,\
  \ it occurred to me that I was situated in a very \"colorful\" neighborhood. The\
  \ window displays of the stores on my street reminded me of photos I'd seen of the\
  \ red light district in Amsterdam; mannequins decked out in minimal strappy leather\
  \ clothing and the highest of patent heels. Admiring the beautifully tiled sidewalks,\
  \ I also noticed that there was no grass... anywhere... and that meant when dogs\
  \ do their business, it just sits there on the tiles like a disgrace to ceramic\
  \ artists everywhere. \n\nSeven or eight days into my Lisbon stay, I developed a\
  \ sort of routine. I would stop in the morning for an espresso, applaud my own ability\
  \ to spit out 'obrigada'/'obrigado' according to the appropriate gender, and then\
  \ just start walking. Most days I spent walking from sun up until sun down, taking\
  \ as many photos as I could, rationing my lavadores cookies from the corner store,\
  \ and reading or napping on park benches to enjoy the weather while simultaneously\
  \ (and inexpensively) killing the time. \n\nIt was also around a week in that I\
  \ realized it was time to visit the LavaMais self-service laundromat I spotted a\
  \ mile or so away. I stuffed my backpack to the brim with my muddy farm clothes\
  \ and started down the street in the hot sun. As I trekked with my 30-pound pack\
  \ forming a sweat river down my spine, I realized this elusive laundromat was further\
  \ than I remembered. Relief hit once I saw the bright cerulean blue sign. \n\nI\
  \ walked in to find I was the only patron of this place. I dropped my backpack to\
  \ the ground, pulled the sole 20 Euro bill from my wallet, and fed it into the coin\
  \ machine. No coins were coming out. I pressed every button and still... no coins\
  \ came out. This machine ate my last 20 Euro bill. I had a backpack full of grimey\
  \ clothes, a hunger in my belly, and a massive sense of defeat. I stepped outside,\
  \ propped myself against a crooked chain link fence, and began snacking on the stale\
  \ lavadores from my backpack, not caring about the crumb trail I was leaving on\
  \ my shirt. Then I noticed a tiny, old lady shuffling in my direction with her head\
  \ down, long silver hair, and a tattered black linen dress. As she passed me she\
  \ turned her head to me and gave me the biggest toothless smile I'd ever seen. It\
  \ was the kind of smile that filled my entire body with sunshine and a whiskey warmth,\
  \ starting from the bottom up. I laughed loudly and uncontrollably to myself as\
  \ she wandered off and thought \"obrigada!!\" but we already spoke the same language;\
  \ the universal language of a smile."
