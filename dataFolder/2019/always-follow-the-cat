Text: I always felt connected with Greece I met this greek girl in Berlin and she
  convinced me to take the next flight to the island and I did, got to Athens grave
  a ferry and arrived in Santorini to the most amazing sunset, I got lost walking
  in the middle of the nigh in the streets of Santorini, tired, mad and super hungry
  I was about to give up, suddenly a cat start meowing at me, maybe I was alucinating
  but if felt like he was talking to me, so I start telling him my story, that I was
  in this self discovery travel, then I ask him where I could find food and the cat
  start walking always meowing at me, I follow him to a house that had right next
  to it a small path that toke me right in the middle of the city plaza, I got into
  a bar where I meet this super sweet guy, next night I came back to that bar, we
