Text: "In our second week in Delhi, we had grown somewhat comfortable in the city\
  \ of 20 million people and sensory overload. There were the sounds \u2013 erratic\
  \ honking, cows mooing, and men yelling in Hindi. There were the sights \u2013 animals,\
  \ the crush of rickshaws, taxis, bikes, walkers, all blended between street and\
  \ sidewalk. And oh, were there smells \u2013 a mix of curries, fruit, but also open\
  \ sewers and spontaneously designated toilets. It was as mesmerizing as it was exhausting,\
  \ but developing a routine helped provide some normalcy. Growing comfortable with\
  \ my surroundings was one thing, yet having my surrounding peers grow comfortable\
  \ with me was another. \n\nI was there with another volunteer to teach at a school\
  \ for children living in one of the slums of the Oklha Phase-II neighborhood in\
  \ Southern Delhi. To call it a school is a bit of a stretch, as it was merely a\
  \ classroom in an alley behind a shack selling tires. The room was a cement slab\
  \ covered by a scrap metal roof, a chalkboard, and some unevenly spaced blankets\
  \ hanging opposite the board. \n\nAfter a week, as we were set to grab some street-side\
  \ Biryani and Roti for lunch, we were, in a serious tone, asked to walk into the\
  \ alley behind the school and into the slum.  We were led by the head of the school,\
  \ a man who had, despite his physical ailments, dedicated his life to giving local\
  \ children in the depths of poverty free education. For many of them, even public\
  \ school in Delhi was too expensive or inaccessible. Most lived in a collection\
  \ of homes squeezed and stacked together to form one dense community.  \n\nTo me\
  \ this walk was the community\u2019s way of showing we were now trusted and welcome.\
  \ They allowed us to walk through a neighborhood seldom seen by outsiders, without\
  \ gawking or judgement, but rather with smiles and greetings. I remember the concerned\
  \ look of a few mothers that walked their children to school on my first day. They\
  \ were entrusting their children with a strange man and woman that lived thousands\
  \ of miles away. Yet after just a few days, they allowed us a vulnerable glimpse\
  \ of their life. \n\nThe man who led us was treated like a scene from The Godfather\
  \ \u2013 children and adults approached him, bowing towards his bowed knees, saying\
  \ the traditional \u201CNamaste.\u201D He hardly said a word\u2013 as he wasn\u2019\
  t a tour guide, but providing us a real perspective of the neighborhood we were\
  \ working in and the children we were helping. \n\nI was constantly ducking beneath\
  \ the low ceilings, and it was dark, with virtually no electricity outside of a\
  \ few homes who had old televisions. Water flowed throughout the pathway between\
  \ homes. Each home was essentially a small room that housed an entire family. Similar\
  \ to the rest of Delhi, we wove through pockets of foul smells followed by delightful\
  \ whiffs of North Indian spices. When pockets of sunlight shone through the makeshift\
  \ tin roofs or stairwells, the collection of homes was particularly beautiful, with\
  \ rarely as much as a single exposed brick unpainted \u2013 showing a communal sense\
  \ of pride. \n\nIn the utmost expression of trust, we were allowed inside one of\
  \ the homes. Our guide asked an older student (about 12 years old) if we could see\
  \ her home. She happily obliged, and her younger brother protectively held my hand\
  \ as we entered. The room was hardly larger than a typical Western closet, with\
  \ one wooden platform functioning as a bed. It was the home of 3 children, no parents.\
  \ \n\nWhat simultaneously broke and warmed my heart, was that these children were\
  \ so incredibly proud to show us their home. This was a constant through the entire\
  \ slum, passing many of our students who were playing games in the space between\
  \ their homes. They were eager to say \u201CI live here.\u201D \n\nThe walk lasted\
  \ 30 minutes. Yet the impact will stay with me forever. In return for volunteering\
  \ a little bit of my time each day to pass some English skills to these eager children,\
  \ they gifted me a lifetime of perspective, and an intimate lesson on pride and\
  \ making the most of what you have."
