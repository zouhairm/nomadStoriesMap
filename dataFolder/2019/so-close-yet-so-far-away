Text: "How ironic. That my leap into the unknown was a two-hour car journey from where\
  \ I had lived my entire life. Somewhere which was a constant source of content for\
  \ our news cycle. Somewhere which dominated the domestic agenda for the latter part\
  \ of the 20th century. The simple act of being born in the Republic of Ireland meant\
  \ be subconsciously transmitted the knowledge of, the opinions on and the burden\
  \ of \u201Cthe troubles up North\u201D without ever really talking about it or getting\
  \ a thorough explanation of what it was. I was born just five years before the Good\
  \ Friday Agreement was signed. I had come of age too late for it to be topical and\
  \ so the story of Northern Ireland was never really explained to me. There was shadow\
  \ cast over the entire region, a veil thinly disguising the past. It was a place\
  \ shrouded in tension, judgement and indifference. I, like many others, was acutely\
  \ aware yet completely oblivious to Northern Ireland. \n\nAs we made our way up\
  \ north that day, the generational differences became clear. My father, a Dubliner\
  \ of 59 years, was wary, anxious even, worried we would walk into the wrong pub.\
  \ Me, on the other hand, I had nothing to fear and if anything, was excited to explore\
  \ this uncharted territory. As we travelled further north, we slowly but surely\
  \ changed territory and simultaneously travelled through time. The language on the\
  \ road signs singularised, the units of measurement on them switched and the flags\
  \ began to polarise. We had travelled for two hours on our small island but we were\
  \ suddenly in a very different place.  \n\nThe city of Belfast was fascinating.\
  \ It filled me with both horror and hope. I wondered how the people of the city\
  \ could live in a place like this but then I wondered how they could ever leave.\
  \ A momentous history billowed in the wind. The cranes of Harland and Wolff reminded\
  \ the city of its past industrial dominance, they commanded the skyline, adamant\
  \ that other parts of history were just as important. Meanwhile the titanic structure\
  \ of the Titanic Experience itself demonstrated why the ship had brought so much\
  \ hope to so many and why its tragedy continues to rock the world. \n\nThe music\
  \ and smiles in the atmospheric, cosy pubs were a familiar comfort. The smell of\
  \ the fresh food being enjoyed, the sound of the pavements being pounded by busy\
  \ workers and the sight of the happy wandering tourists. The buzz of the city was\
  \ undeniable, but something loomed in the background. This working-class city had\
  \ been dragged here. It was a culture-packed cosmopolitan city with the hand of\
  \ history firmly placed on top of it. It had stories to tell. \n\nThe local insights\
  \ we heard while touring through the various estates in and around the city brought\
  \ all those news reports and political speeches to life. The estates were like tributes\
  \ to a way of life. Every wall seemed to be a space to say something political,\
  \ meaningful, hateful, hopeful or sorrowful. The people were the friendliest, most\
  \ welcoming, most down-to-earth in the world but trapped in what seemed like a time\
  \ warp. I couldn\u2019t help but think about the children being born here today.\
  \ To live in this polarising magnetic field. A place so emotionally charged, so\
  \ visibly steeped in history must make change a hard thing to do, the past a hard\
  \ thing to forget and loyalty a hard thing to dismiss. How easy it is to become\
  \ staunch, to become stubborn, to lose yourself and to lose the meaning of it all.\n\
  \nAs I walked around Belfast I felt ashamed and inspired. Both the pride of patriotism\
  \ and the futility of it all conflicted me. The contemporary in me asked why this\
  \ was all so important while the nationalist in me sparked thoughts of our ancestors\
  \ fighting for freedom a hundred years earlier. I have been to other continents,\
  \ visited far flung, exotic and breath-taking places but I was left truly fascinated\
  \ by this city only down the road from where I had grown up. A leap into the unknown\
  \ just made me want to know more."
