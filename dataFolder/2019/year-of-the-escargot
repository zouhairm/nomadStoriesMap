Text: "My first impression of parisians was a clich\xE9. I thought they were mean.\
  \ But destiny had a thing prepared for me: love. After a year of a long distance\
  \ relationship with a mean Parisian, I decided to spend new year with him in Paris.\n\
  \ I arrived at Gare du Nord and understood all the Hollywood love films in that\
  \ moment. Romantic music invaded my mind while I looked for his face in the train\
  \ station. And there he was all blond and handsome, holding a sign with the words\
  \ \u201Ctaxi for mexicano\u201D.\nNext day came. I\u2019m not a very social person\
  \ so panic invaded me. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect for New Year\u2019s Eve\
  \ party. We needed to buy some food for the party so we headed to Galleries Lafayette\
  \ Gourmet, a nice food store full of people. We bought a couple things and left\
  \ to go buy some cheaper food in carrefour. And guess what? It was also crowded.\
  \ I guess panic shopping happens worldwide.  \nWe got back home and I had a French\
  \ cuisine class. We prepared a cake with white chocolate and a quiche. I say \u201C\
  we\u201D in order to feel part of the story but the truth is I only washed dishes.\n\
  Metro was free that night and very crowded. I remained quiet most of the trip trying\
  \ to calm down by watching people\u2019s outfits. \nWe arrived in Place de la Bastille\
  \ and walked a few blocks to get into the party. The tinniest elevator I\u2019ve\
  \ ever been in took us there. Door was opened and a tall man in a leopard pijama\
  \ appeared. It was a leopard theme party, so we were almost the only ones with no\
  \ leopard custome. Bad start. \nA lot of food was already on the table so I started\
  \ eating immediately. Those first moments were strange and full of anxiety. The\
  \ question \u201CWhy am I here?\u201D assaulted my mind as I heard people speaking\
  \ French, not being able to understand a single word. \nIt was time to take out\
  \ my secret weapon: Mexican candy. I offered everyone a mazap\xE1n and they all\
  \ accepted it. People started to get drunk and so did I. Small conversations in\
  \ English appeared, I wasn\u2019t alone anymore!\nMore people arrived and that meant\
  \ more food on the table. Foie gras wasn\u2019t pretty to watch but I had to eat\
  \ it to please my French hosts. It wasn\u2019t my favorite thing but it was good\
  \ enough to avoid making funny faces. I thought that was the weirdest thing I had\
  \ to try for the night, but it wasn\u2019t. A little box with mysterious food was\
  \ opened and I felt how everyone started watching me. Christophe approached me and\
  \ said I should try something else: escargot. At first I didn\u2019t knew what he\
  \ was talking about because of my precarious French knowledge, but then I saw it:\
  \ a snail shell. I freaked out immediately and shouted NO! So everyone close to\
  \ the area started encouraging me saying it was traditional food or even telling\
  \ me the animal taste was bad but the sauce it was prepared with was the best. I\
  \ felt blood filling my brain and I thought \u201CI\u2019m already here, let\u2019\
  s do it\u201D. I said I would try it and someone gave me a glass in case I wanted\
  \ to throw the snail. I took a toothpick and one of those little shells, took the\
  \ animal out of it, watched it\u2019s ugliness for three seconds and then put it\
  \ in my mouth. I must have made a horrible face, people around me started laughing.\
  \ I chew and chew until I could swallow the entire thing. It was amazing. I mean,\
  \ the taste was the worst but the experience was one of those unforgettable things\
  \ you tell everyone over and over. I remember discussing the taste with my new French\
  \ friends and then dancing and singing songs from all around the world until it\
  \ was time to drink champagne and toast for the new year, the year of the escargot\
  \ cause I\u2019ve told everyone I know the story of how I ate this disgusting snail\
  \ and had one of the greatest nights of my life."
