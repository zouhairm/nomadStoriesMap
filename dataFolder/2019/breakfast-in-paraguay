Text: "\"Well, getting stuck outside of Nottingham is not quite the same as getting\
  \ stuck in the Brazilian desert at 2am.\" - Han's friend (2018).\n\nIt's a trip\
  \ that I still love to talk about five years later, not for the shock factor but\
  \ for the pot of gold that I came home with.\n\nMore often than not, when I tell\
  \ people about the trip to see Iguassu Falls, people are shocked. \n\nIf there is\
  \ a shock factor to this story though, it is not: \n*Taking an overnight bus by\
  \ my twenty year old self from one side of Brazil to the other. \n*Getting stuck\
  \ in the middle of the Paran\xE1 desert when the bus broke down at 2am - with only\
  \ one tiny tuck shop for miles. \n*When a woman chose 2am in the middle of the Paran\xE1\
  \ desert to try and set me up with her son. (Oh! He had just graduated in engineering\
  \ from the same university I was studying at and they were taking a three day trip\
  \ too. What a coinkydink!) No that part was funny! Especially when I bolted off\
  \ the bus at the end and dove into a taxi before they could catch up with me. \n\
  \nNo, the shocking part for me was becoming friends with Thales. It went against\
  \ every instinct of my being that year.\n\nAfter spending one and a half glorious\
  \ days mesmerised by the 'Niagara Falls of South America' on both the Brazilian\
  \ and Argentinian sides, I arrived back at my hostel in Foz do Iguassu on the last\
  \ evening and got chatting to two German girls about their travels. A Brazilian\
  \ guy then joined us. This was Thales.\n\nHe had just arrived from the north of\
  \ Brazil and was on a solo trip by himself as his girlfriend had to work. He asked\
  \ about the Falls and what we had planned. The three of us went into gush mode,\
  \ telling him to see both sides because they are equally as impressive. Seeing the\
  \ self-created rainbow on the Brazilian side and exploring the winding paths on\
  \ the Argentinian side. I then mentioned I was going to Paraguay in the morning\
  \ before my coach trip back.\n\nTo which Thales told us he had never been abroad\
  \ and asked if he could join me.\n\nNow, throughout the year in Brazil I had put\
  \ my walls up a bit, particularly when it came to strange men. Even if they had\
  \ girlfriends or wives, you weren't necessarily immune from being hit on as a foreigner.\
  \ \n\nBut making our way towards the border the next morning however, Thales treated\
  \ me like any friend would. He laughed at my ridiculous determination to get a Paraguay\
  \ passport stamp - even though you didn't need it. Then I tried not to laugh at\
  \ his complete bewilderment when a man who showed us the way to a shop that Thales\
  \ wanted to go to, then turned around and asked for money at the end. Even though\
  \ I told Thales that he would.\n\nCiudad Del Este is a strange limbo of a place.\
  \ Dusty buildings filled to the brim with (mostly fake) goods, opium sold on the\
  \ street corner like normal tobacco and a buzz of different Spanish, Portuguese\
  \ and indigenous dialects. There were even about three different types of currency\
  \ that you could use just to buy bread because so many different people go in and\
  \ out of the place.\n\nDespite the Deep Blue Something song being firmly fixed in\
  \ my head, we never actually ate breakfast in Paraguay. In the end we either couldn't\
  \ decide where to go or didn't have the correct currency for the individual restaurant.\n\
  \nWhen we parted ways back in Brazil, I never could have imagined that I had made\
  \ a friend for life. One who then came to visit in London four years later with\
  \ his now wife. A friend I'm now planning on meeting up with somewhere in Europe\
  \ next year. A friend that, dare I mention, I would rely on more than someone I\
  \ spent four years studying with.\n\nA small pot of friendship gold at the end of\
  \ a self-created rainbow that I had never expected to find in the South American\
  \ jungle."
