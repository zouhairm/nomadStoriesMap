Text: "A last minute decision brought me to a place I never anticipated going, Sao\
  \ Paolo. It was my first time in Brazil, the home of my grandmother, Vova. I was\
  \ tired, just getting off a red-eye eight-hour flight. Though I would like to say\
  \ I was tired from anticipation at seeing the city of my Vova\u2019s childhood,\
  \ I was mostly tired because the bilingual passenger next to me stole my pillow\
  \ and blanket, and then pretended not to understand me when I told him in English\
  \ and Portuguese \u201Cthose are mine\u201D right before he closed his eyes.\n\n\
  My imperfect and very formal Portuguese was a gift Vova gave me during my college\
  \ years before she died. Now it was the only thing I had to communicate with her\
  \ family, whom I had never met before, and who was waiting for me after customs.\
  \ My cousin Afonso, an appellate judge for the State of Sao Paolo, drove me from\
  \ the airport to his family\u2019s apartment in the bairro of Higien\xF3polis. On\
  \ the way there he drove through the famous Paulista Avenue and pointed out street\
  \ art by Kobra that I had as my iphone\u2019s wallpaper. This was all surreal, and\
  \ usually, I\u2019d be enthralled by buildings I had only seen in Google Images.\
  \ However, none of that was as important as the prayer I was saying below my breath,\
  \ \u201CVova, please make them like me.\u201D\n\nI think Vova came through, because\
  \ in such a short period of time I had seen more family then I knew I had, ate more\
  \ then I hoped, and slept less then I would have liked. Afonso showed me the Vova\u2019\
  s old bairro, 25 de Marco. A poor, but bustling commercial center that was popping\
  \ with life. It did make you want to keep your hands in your pockets and on your\
  \ wallet, just to be safe. Vova always spoke of it like it was Champs Elysees, but\
  \ I don\u2019t think Paris has a knock-off electronics store right next to the Arc\
  \ de Triomphe. How humble were Vova\u2019s roots? I missed her.\n\nIn ten days,\
  \ I had seen a lot of Vova\u2019s old stomping grounds, but I hadn\u2019t felt a\
  \ connection with Brazil. I was hoping in being here I would find the same love\
  \ in these buildings that Vova had. I wanted Brazil to be my second home. I had\
  \ a couple days left and felt like I only had a long family history lesson. One\
  \ morning Enrique, Afonso\u2019s son, woke me up and asked if I would like to go\
  \ on a road trip with him to Praia Brava. He said it was a three-hour drive through\
  \ the mountains near the beach city of Sao Sebastiao, and a one-hour hike through\
  \ the jungle, but it was worth it. Was I interested? Duh.\n\nTowering trees that\
  \ eclipsed the sun and sounds of birds from all around made me feel like I was in\
  \ the Amazon. My short Brasilian cousin, admired the webs of the poisonous Banana\
  \ spiders, while I at 6\u20194\u201D ran into them with my face. We were careful\
  \ to watch our step but got excited as the pounding of waves drew closer and closer.\
  \ First up the mountain and then down, the sounds of Praia Brava were like a siren\u2019\
  s song, enticing Enrique and I to run ever faster to its call. The number of spiders\
  \ grew fewer as the sound of the waves grew louder. After two hours of walking,\
  \ we were now running.\n\nThe canopy of trees gave way beige sand. The mountains\
  \ we had climbed hugged the bay as the tallest waves I had ever seen cascaded onto\
  \ the beach like they were mad at the sand. One by one they followed each other,\
  \ symmetrical, consistent, soothing, almost poetic. The water was warm, the sun\
  \ was welcoming, and the shade of a tree called my name. No cellphone service ensured\
  \ that family couldn\u2019t reach me in this uninhabited place. There was no one\
  \ but Enrique and I for miles around. The beach was ours. This wasn\u2019t Vova\u2019\
  s Brazil. This wasn\u2019t Google Images Brazil. This was my Brazil. I had found\
  \ my connection, and I\u2019ll never let it go."
