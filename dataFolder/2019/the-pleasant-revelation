Text: "Looking at my phone screen the time flashed up 13.45, it had been several hours\
  \ since we had landed on the tarmac. Despite the restless sleep and early start\
  \ we had found the energy to venture out into the cobbled streets of the city of\
  \ Rome. The morning seemed to have passed in a blur of quick transfers hopping from\
  \ plane to train to bus eventually managing to find our hotel in one of the many\
  \ backstreets of the web-like city. The sun had greeted us from the moment we landed\
  \ with nothing but blue skies and the Italian heat baking the brown stone beneath\
  \ my feet. \n\nWalking through the streets was always the best way to see a city,\
  \ to listen to the snippets of conversation of others walking past, to smell the\
  \ various alluring scents of restaurants cooking pizza from stone baked ovens, seeing\
  \ the vividness of colour the sky gave the city. The streets were alive with a flurry\
  \ of people and traffic unlike anything I had seen before. Each street we turned\
  \ seemed packed with countless cars, all of which seemed to bear the mark of some\
  \ previous small collision. I have truly never encountered such creative parking.\
  \ I was accompanied by my friend and we had resolved to make our way towards the\
  \ Colosseum to take our obligatory tourist photos of ourselves and the ancient ruins.\
  \ The beauty of the city was beyond description, with marks of history to be found\
  \ on every building that we passed from small notches in the brick to detailed carvings\
  \ adorning the facades. My eyes were drawn up to the buildings, only once temporarily\
  \ distracted by a gentleman dressed in the full armour of a Roman General with a\
  \ dazzling red cape to match. Yet, the impressive General was immediately forgotten\
  \ as we reached the end of the street. \n\nWe had stumbled upon the Roman Forum\
  \ with the last remains of the Ancient city sprawled out in sunken terraces but\
  \ that was not what had arrested my attention. Directly in front of us stood The\
  \ Vittorio Emanuele II Monument, more poetically known as Altare della Patria \u2013\
  \ Altar of the Fatherland. The colossal size of the monument is difficult to ignore\
  \ with the vast columns of white marble illuminating the majesty of the building\
  \ from every angle. The building looked slightly out of place in its surroundings,\
  \ but I don\u2019t imagine that it was ever the intention to fade into the background.\
  \ \n\nIn all the postcards and travel programmes I had seen of Rome this magnificent\
  \ building had never been in one of them, often eclipsed by the great Colosseum\
  \ or the Vatican City. Yet here it stood demanding our attention and our admiration.\
  \ Rome had always been a destination I had wished to see for myself and somehow,\
  \ I had fully expected to be disappointed by it. Countless documentaries, movies,\
  \ and articles have captured almost every corner of the city to the point where\
  \ one can develop almost a strong familiarity with it. However, as I discovered\
  \ on that first day and in the days that followed, not one pixel of a photo could\
  \ capture the moment you realise the immense beauty of Rome. For me it was coming\
  \ upon this great monument that forced me to forget about what I thought I knew\
  \ to be replaced with the pleasant realisation of discovering a city that I fully\
  \ did not expect to find."
