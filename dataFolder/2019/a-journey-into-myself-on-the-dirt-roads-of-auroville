Text: "It was a feverish heat on that sunny day in Auroville, India, when I was watching\
  \ my two kids jumping and playing in the playground with five other children from\
  \ different countries. The moment that my two-year-old son got into the top at that\
  \ slide for his first time, taking his time to find his courage to slip with his\
  \ small eyes gleaming in anticipation, I had a moment of reflection thinking: Will\
  \ this journey really help me to identify what best suits our family lifestyle?\n\
  \nThe first time I heard from Auroville it was during our planning of this one-year\
  \ sabbatical around the world. Our goal is trying different lifestyles to find learning\
  \ that could improve us as parents to raise the potential of our children. Besides,\
  \ would be a good opportunity to think over the future and the shapes that it could\
  \ take. Somehow, Auroville allows all these experiences. \n\nAuroville is an intentional\
  \ community founded 51 years ago, motivated to be the place of global unity and\
  \ a experiment to create a \u201C\u2026new life that is more harmonious and true\u201D\
  \ as a well-documented dream describes its future. This future has not yet arrived,\
  \ but is clearly progressively evolving on this 2500 habitants\u2019 city. They\
  \ institutionalized since its foundation the idea of \u201Cno nations, no religion\
  \ and no possessions\u201D. Somehow it looks like the materialization of John Lennon\u2019\
  s song - \u201DImagine\u201D. Clearly he was not the only one dreamer\u2026 \n\n\
  Something that caught my attention during this research phase was that these 210\
  \ acres, a desert by the time of its foundation, although located in southern India,\
  \ were agreed to be a land of the humanity supported by United Nations, which none\
  \ Nation could call your own. All the houses and buildings belong to the Auroville\
  \ Institution, which demands of all citizens a detached spirit. And all religious\
  \ and believers should be respected, or more, encouraged finding their direct connection\
  \ with the divine, without the need for intermediaries. \n\nToday, on our bikes\
  \ and child-safe seats, we ride red dirt roads, most of which shaded by more than\
  \ 2 million trees planted in those five decades. Which in somehow an adventure in\
  \ itself, compared to our previous life in Sao Paulo City, with its heavy traffic\
  \ jams and fancy offices.  We have been living the last month in different places,\
  \ trying from small apartments to bamboo huts in the middle of a forest. It has\
  \ been a great experience to identify our potentials and limits that are exposed\
  \ when we are out of our comfort zone. \n\nHere is not exactly a touristic place.\
  \ The invitation is not to be a kind of spectator of a human zoo, but to take part\
  \ of this experience and contribute with your own experience and work, adding another\
  \ brick on that bridge to the future. There are many ways to contribute in more\
  \ than twenty projects with volunteer opportunities for work. Some are traditional\
  \ as cleaning and others are more sophisticated as working on research or installing\
  \ renewable energy equipment on facilities from the 60\u2019s that looks like they\
  \ were taken from that TV series \u201CLost\u201D, behind trees, with that front\
  \ door sign so strange as \u201CQuantum Researches and Magnetic Studies\u201D. Highlight\
  \ for one project in particularly, called Sadhana Forest that over the last 15 years\
  \ is rebuilding a forest that almost disappeared from the Earth due to human environmental\
  \ impacts. Working there, it has brought us a strong sense of belonging to nature\
  \ with practical classes on climate changes, water conservation, reforestation and\
  \ zero waste.\n \nAs soon as my kid got into that sand in the end of that slide,\
  \ I also had my experience and realize that maybe the right answer of a lifestyle\
  \ is still to be uncovered, or maybe there is not actually one. And just like him,\
  \ I also wanted to take another round on that city to figure it out another aspect\
  \ on me that was visible only that far from my comfort and somehow not in control\
  \ of the outcome, that a trip in places like Auroville can offer."
