Text: "It was august 1st 2016, I, for the first time in my life, had decided to backpack\
  \ as a 40 year old birthday present and after the most difficult break up in my\
  \ whole life. I had planned this for at least 6 months in advance and thought everything\
  \ would turn out to be a one in a life time experience, after all, it was Europe,\
  \ one of my biggest dreams ever since I was a little child. My sister and two of\
  \ my best friends took me to the airport on this 3-month adventure I was about to\
  \ start and I just couldn't believe it, I was going to Europe; so after all the\
  \ kisses, hugs and good luck wishes I finally left. \n\nIt was my first longest\
  \ flight, almost 17 hours, and the arrival place was northern Europe, Norway, where\
  \ I was going to visit a very dear friend whom I hadn't seen since we had finished\
  \ highschool, she was an exchange student back then and I was beginning to learn\
  \ English so I'd become friends with anyone who looked as a foreigner, and that\
  \ was my first stop. The plan was actually that there was no plan, I'd be staying\
  \ with her for a couple of days, going around, visiting and after some time when\
  \ I felt ready I'd just start backpacking. I was with her for about 8 days and it\
  \ was wonderful but soon I started feeling this urge to start what I had gone there\
  \ for.\nSo after drafting the beginning of my trip I flew to my first city and got\
  \ ready to backpack. To be honest, I was terrified and excited at the same time,\
  \ and eventhough I knew this was a dream come true I just couldn't understand how\
  \ I was going to manage to be travelling for 3 months moving from one city to another\
  \ all by myself. \nAs I started wandering around and moving from one hostel to another\
  \ from city to city, away from home, with no cellphone available and only wifi connection,\
  \ I began feeling terribly alone, I couldn't stop thinking about everything, my\
  \ life, my story, my ex, the trip, my family, and everything else that was important\
  \ to me; I wanted to be strong and fine at first but after 3 weeks I just broke\
  \ into pieces, it was in Frankfurt where I just burst into tears in a park, wishing\
  \ I were home where everything was familiar and where I had everything I \"needed\
  \ to be happy\", I was crying for at least 2 hours and I had decided to go back\
  \ to Mexico immediately, but soon I realized I couldn't, I was stuck there and even\
  \ if I wanted it'd take me at least 2 days to go back considering that I had to\
  \ pick up the rest of my luggage back in Norway, so after realizing that I was ALONE\
  \ in the middle of nowhere in Europe I just decided I'd stay and finish the trip\
  \ as planned.\nThe following days and weeks were a lot easier, feeling better everyday\
  \ and finally finding what I really needed to be happy, what I hadn't found in 39\
  \ years of existence, I'd finally found my own company. \nAs incredible as it sounds,\
  \ the rest of the trip just started getting better and when I reached Italy I was\
  \ completely at peace, getting ready to get to the final destination of my trip\
  \ which was Amsterdam, where I'd visit another old friend of mine. Those last weeks\
  \ where amazing, I made new friends, took long walks and hundreds of pictures, laughed,\
  \ ate and by the time I went back to Norway to pick up my things and fly back home\
  \ I had already found the missing piece of my this puzzle called life, I had found\
  \ myself for the first time. It took me 77 days around Europe to find myself and\
  \ it was the best trip of my life."
