Text: "I have been to an island that is far a way from home and I must admit it's\
  \ a whole different life out there, coming from a country that is landlocked and\
  \ finding your self at an island that is literally an opposite life of what you\
  \ have home is just a whole different life style. \n\nAt this island I have managed\
  \ to experience the heart and love of Indian's , Chinese , french and Creole people.\
  \ I haven't learnt to open an experience new culture without any sort of obstacles\
  \ that is in terms of religions and lifestyle. I would say my life would have never\
  \ been the same if it wasn't from the chance to be at another country. \n\nComing\
  \ from my home country Rwanda made me realize that there is an outer life that an\
  \ islander experiences and that life is all about what we make it I call this island\
  \ paradise but to some people that are here it might be maybe a limitation towards\
  \ there dream. \n\nThe reason why I connect a lot with this island is because my\
  \ film making journey has grown extensively that is through the fact that there\
  \ is space to explorer and do your photography freely and the fact that people make\
  \ it a better place for you to be more creative for yourself. \n\nIt is fully of\
  \ beautiful people and places that you can't literally explain by just words. I\
  \ managed to shoot one my best videos that's titles life of horse racers and this\
  \ story made me happy since I was telling this story about this islands' number\
  \ one spot. \n\nI have witnessed a lot but I have never seen beauty that is fully\
  \ packed in one place. Knowing that am going to wake up to seeing a beautiful day\
  \ with a different positive vibe has been great and helps me want to tell more stories.\
  \ \n\nI will not have been who I am today but the fact that I had a chance to step\
  \ out and tell my story the way I want made me a better me but most importantly\
  \ I owe it all to the beautiful island of Mauritius."
