Text: "My name is Gitana Martinez, my family is originally from El Salvador.  I grew\
  \ up in the San Fernando Valley, Ca., but I had been residing in Santa Cruz County/\
  \ Bay Area since 1993. In February 2014, I embarked on a \"work tour\". I lived\
  \ in Stockholm, Paris, Granada, Buenos Aires, San Salvador and Porto over the next\
  \ 3.5 years. I dedicated this time in my life to deepening my transformational healing\
  \ arts work, developing a transnational wellness and empowerment curriculum project\
  \ and to building a network of colleagues with the same passions and interests.\
  \ My main focus of interest throughout this tour was to develop interdisciplinary\
  \ art exhibits and workshops that intersected environmental/ social relevancy issues\
  \ and transnational cultural education. \n\nUnderneath this creative and professional\
  \ journey... was also a desire and search for home, for \"true belonging\". I inherited\
  \ my families \"displacement\" story, along with their wit and strength. In late\
  \ 2013, I was witnessing my 14 year relationship disintegrate. Since most of my\
  \ family lived spread out all over the world... I made the choice to sell my belongings,\
  \ buy a bunch of one way tickets and begin reconnecting with characters from my\
  \ familial past. This was a 3.5 year journey process. And even though I unexpectedly\
  \ find myself back in L.A., my soul is still journeying while reconciling all that\
  \ I experienced.  My story bridges many things: A Leap of Faith, Finding Family\
  \ in Unexpected Places... True Belonging. The Belonging that happens on a transpersonal\
  \ level that can only be found in your body-relationship to this world... and for\
  \ me, being on the \"road\" brings me home... as well as understanding \"Saudade\"\
  . \n\nSaudade... you are so beautiful. In Portugal, Saudade... \"is a deep emotional\
  \ state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing for an absent something or\
  \ someone that one loves. Moreover, it often carries a repressed knowledge that\
  \ the object of longing might never return. A stronger form of saudade might be\
  \ felt towards people and things whose whereabouts are unknown, such as a lost lover,\
  \ or a family member who has gone missing, moved away, separated, or died.\"\n\n\
  But I always think of it... as loving so much... that you can't stop loving just\
  \ because you can't see with your eyes. And like As Andorinhas... the swallows...\
  \ the love that only returns once a year. Do you stop loving just because they are\
  \ gone? \n\nAnd... since I've always been this way... and as I've peered at life\
  \ through the eyes of an ever present  five year old girl... filled with wonderment\
  \ at life's miracles... and maybe because I never grew up with a mother or a father...\
  \ maybe because I've always felt like an orphan... finding more comfort in the kind\
  \ eyes of strangers and more safety in the unknown than in the familiar because\
  \ a direct access to the infinite, Great Mystery was more palpable ...  for all\
  \ these reasons and other lil secrets, perhaps all of it together is why this longing,\
  \ this familiar way of being... of drifting from romantic musings to heightened\
  \ moments of renewal...   is just a way of living... is just a way of saying \"\
  I love you\". \"I love you\" because I never knew you, but you've always been real\
  \ and you will always be alive in me as I am alive in you. \n\nPerhaps because I\
  \ have my family members on three different continents, scattered throughout eight\
  \ different countries, I'm always longing for someone. Longing for someone I never\
  \ know when I'll see, or if the last time I saw them was actually the last time...\
  \ my heart is always vibrantly alive soaking in every precious second and simultaneously\
  \ filled with this beautiful, intense lovely melancholy. \n\nAlways most at home\
  \ on small village-city streets... comforted by the whispers on winds, feeling the\
  \ warmth of the Sun penetrating on my skin and being in communion with the deep\
  \ healing of all the elements ... life, even just the smallest detail of life, becomes\
  \ an anchor for living... you witnessing yourself and communicating to the essence\
  \ that runs through everything connects you to everything that you love. \n\nThis\
  \ is the story, I am longing to tell. Thank you for your sacred witness."
