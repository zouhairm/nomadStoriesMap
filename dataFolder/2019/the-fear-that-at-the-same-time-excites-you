Text: 'This caused me one trip that would take me to the sea, places I did not know,
  that would make me know people I had never seen before, I had no idea what they
  would be like or if I would tolerate them in so many hours and days. Take my backpack
  and few money and this is how with fear but excitement began my journey.

  Along the way, we tried to get to know each other and know our names and occupations,
  how we got there and if we knew the others and where we were going. After several
  shots we made as an unconscious covenant of our new friendship, the talk was so
  good that I just closed my eyes so I could sleep.

  We live so many moments, so many places, so many little difficulties that made us
  more united, deep talks and even diseases that make us value ourselves as people.
  After losing myself on a beach and knowing how important it was to find me I knew
  that this was not my trip ... this was our trip, which made us take care of some
  people, who taught us to share, respect and receive teachings.

  So it was like with people who did not know I lived the best trip of my life and
  well say that a person only knows better on a trip, Well I think that happened and
  that with them a lifelong traveling friendship.'
