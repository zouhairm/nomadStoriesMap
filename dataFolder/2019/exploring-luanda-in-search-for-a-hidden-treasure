Text: "Luanda, Angola\u2019s chief seaport and capital, was welcoming me from below\
  \ with uneven squares of grey and brown. First time in Africa, I arrived for work\
  \ and was exited and secretly scared to see my new duty station. A colleague picked\
  \ me up and rushed to mentor me on security issues. \nLuanda did not bother to welcome\
  \ newcomers with flowers and clean roads. The airport area, notorious for being\
  \ one of the most dangerous parts of the city, was covered in dirt and surrounded\
  \ by slums. Trapped in a car, we were barely moving; traffic jams made part of a\
  \ daily routine. Infrastructure built in the old days was struggling to handle fast\
  \ growing population that leapfrogged from four hundred thousand in 1940\u2019s\
  \ to two and a half millions, hosting one third of the whole country. Moreover,\
  \ with its unusual u-turn type intersections, the city designed by Portuguese for\
  \ free flowing traffic, suffered from recently introduced traffic lights. As we\
  \ were slowly making our way through the clogged roads some locals approached the\
  \ vehicle begging for money, selling fruits, wooden figures, some Chinese-made gadgets\
  \ and just staring at those white strangers. Later I faced a gun robbery in a similar\
  \ traffic jam. \n\nLuanda was not easy to fall in love with at first sight. Constant\
  \ uncomfortable attention, youngsters at parking spots claiming money for keeping\
  \ an eye on one\u2019s car or just for not making damage to it, and numerous quite\
  \ insistent street vendors made my urban exploration more challenging. Yet, who\
  \ was I to complain, this place was screaming extreme poverty and inequality and\
  \ I was obviously richer than most of its residents.\n\nMarginal de Luanda, the\
  \ city sea front had lost some of its 1960\u2019s postcard grace. Older low-rise\
  \ buildings with wrecked walls were worn-out. They say after the Carnation Revolution\
  \ many Portuguese families fled the country leaving fully furnished apartments behind.\
  \ After the independence Angola was absorbed by the civil war that lasted until\
  \ 2002. Torn by fighting elites and struggling to feed the poorest the government\
  \ was not concerned about restoration of cultural heritage linked to colonialism\
  \ and slavery. A few city landmarks, fortresses and old mansions, were mostly hidden\
  \ up in the hills or in some abandoned parks, monuments to colonial administration\
  \ leaders were moved from the city center.\n\nA diligent student of lusophone history\
  \ and culture, I was anxious to try and taste everything local. Finding an affordable\
  \ place to eat in Angola\u2019s capital was a challenge. Luanda gained its fame\
  \ of the world\u2019s most expensive city to live in for a reason: prices were ridiculously\
  \ high and most of restaurants were out of an average resident\u2019s budget. Willing\
  \ to try something authentic I went once to a local eatery despite having been warned\
  \ of a high chance to catch some tropical bacteria. I was the only foreigner there\
  \ and as my curiosity was winning over health precautions, I examined the buffet\
  \ options: rice and cassava flour porridge, calulu, dry fish cooked with some vegetables\
  \ in lots of palm oil, some giant fried bananas; all designed to keep one full for\
  \ a long time. \n\nMy experience turned out to be safe, yet the stomach infection\
  \ got me some weeks later. In the next couple of months, I survived malaria, got\
  \ my wallet and camera stolen, witnessed an armed robbery and still chose to stay\
  \ in Luanda. Something else that opened up to me with time made those daily difficulties\
  \ less important. There was something unique and more meaningful about this city:\
  \ kids playing capoeira in the streets, couples moving in the rhythm of kizomba\
  \ that was in their blood, ability of the most poor to be cheerful and to appreciate\
  \ every day of their lives; admiration of children in the market when they asked\
  \ for permission to touch my hair thinking it was golden; sincere kindness of people\
  \ who barely knew me and accepted me as I was. Living so close to Atlantic ocean\
  \ I could feel the sea breeze and sometimes hear a gentle whisper. Those must have\
  \ been kiandas, beautiful mermaids, that according to an old legend lived in the\
  \ water and protected late fishermen looking for a way back home."
