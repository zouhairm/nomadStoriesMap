Text: "Germany. What do you think of when you hear that name? An economical and political\
  \ monster? An old story with nazis in it? A fairy tale? \nIn my case it was an old\
  \ mixture of all the three before said. I was born and raised in Mexico, in the\
  \ wund of a middle-class family where nothing much happened besides our mandatory\
  \ vacations twice a year. \nMy grandparents were just regular low level workers,\
  \ and my mother was a teacher, how much more common could my family possibly be?\
  \ \nBut I wanted something different, I dreamed of traveling, I wanted to become\
  \ a journalist, I wanted to be on the core of conflicts, telling stories that would\
  \ change the world, I wanted to discover greatness, I wanted to be great (actually\
  \ anything except \"common\"). \nHowever, by the age of 25 I had achieved none of\
  \ it. Yes, I majored in literature, yes I had traveled abroad (by then I already\
  \ knew 15 different lands), but all of that seem selfish, vain. On my trips I hadn't\
  \ discovered anything interesting (other than my privilige and economical well-being).\
  \ I had only collected a couple of funny cultural anecdotes. But, was I really living\
  \ by the principles that were suppose to be driving my life choices? No, I hadn't\
  \ done anything remarkable.\nThat's when I chose to become an au pair. For me it\
  \ was an opportunity to experience life in a different country, and probably a small\
  \ leap into the type of life that I really wanted. I didn't have a clear plan, by\
  \ then I didn't even know what an au pair really was. I don't think I even propertly\
  \ understood what living on a different country meant. I took a leap of faith and\
  \ waited for the universe to compensate me. \nAnd the universe does have strange\
  \ ways to \"compensate\" you. My experience was not at all the magical fairytale\
  \ I was told it would be, there were not \"loving children\" or \"comprehensive\
  \ mothers from other lands\". There was only a lot of misunderstanding coming from\
  \ my lack of abilities in the german language, and a lot of dirty diapers to change.\
  \ \nBut Germany, itself, was magnificent. Being from America (the Continent) there\
  \ is so little information about the german culture. Yes, everyone knows about technology,\
  \ cars, and Oktoberfest. But only so few know about the beautiful medieval villages\
  \ lost in the black forest, the cozy Christmas celebrations germans have, the big\
  \ enviromental compromise most germans show. And, in general, how warm hearted most\
  \ germans really are. \nI was also surprised to see how multicultural Germany is,\
  \ there I met people from middle east, east and a lot of southamerican friends that\
  \ were, just like me, trying to adapt to a new way of life, and, especially, to\
  \ the strict scheduling of germans. \nBy the end of the year I felt more personally\
  \ attached to conflicts on the Middle East, many of the friends I did came from\
  \ there, I understood more deeply the conflicts within Europe and, in general, I\
  \ ended up with a much wider vision of the world we all share. \nThe year as au\
  \ pair has ended, but my thrive to learn more has just been born. Thanks for that,\
  \ Germany."
