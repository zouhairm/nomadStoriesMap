Text: "On a hot summer day in Tokyo, I decided to venture out of the hospital that\
  \ I was interning at to finally eat something other than hospital bentos for lunch.\
  \ As soon as morning clinic finished, I rushed out with my friend. \n\nWe\u2019\
  d heard great things about the nearby Tsukiji Market and wanted to have a taste\
  \ of the fresh seafood there. Google maps routed it for us. Easy 20 min walk. Decision\
  \ made. Proceed with plan.\n\nYet 20 minutes under the hot blazing sun at noon did\
  \ not seem a great idea at all. We had probably only made it 5 mins out of the hospital\
  \ before we were sweating through our normal clothes, with sweat threatening to\
  \ soak through to our white coats too. Motivation to continue with this midday \u201C\
  hike\u201D was at an all-time low. My stomach is also grumbling with hunger. \u201C\
  Do you think we need to go all the way to the main market to have nice seafood?\u201D\
  \ I asked my friend tentatively. Please agree to changing our lunch plans. I thought\
  \ to myself.\n\nWe turned a corner and thankfully I saw the welcoming sight of a\
  \ busy retail street. It seems to be a host to a range of fast food stores, clothing\
  \ stores and lots of restaurants offering lunch time deals. The footpath was flocked\
  \ with other lunch-seeking workers, many in their cooperate gear. How they deal\
  \ with that attire in this heat is truly unimaginable. \n\nAfter ruling out western\
  \ franchises \u2013 sorry but I did not come all the way to Tokyo for this \u2013\
  \ we were left with plenty of options still. Yet after careful reading of the signage\
  \ of the restaurants, there were some that seem too high-end for us and then some\
  \ that had huge queues that meant we would not be able to make it back to the hospital\
  \ on time for our next session. Ah, are we simply too picky? Come on, surely there\
  \ is somewhere with lunch for two poor, famished elective students amongst all these\
  \ restaurants and eateries.\n\nThen in the corner of the street, I saw someone coming\
  \ out of a small set of wooden sliding doors, thanking the owner after his meal,\
  \ before disappearing into the crowd again. There is a small sign with pictures\
  \ of seafood on rice and it seemed all to be set meals at less than $8. \u201CWhat\
  \ about here?\u201D I asked while half-dragging my friend over to face the store.\n\
  \nFacing us stood a little wooden establishment built in the traditional Japanese\
  \ manner which seemed a little out of place in amongst all the skyscrapers of central\
  \ Tokyo. It looked a little squashed by its taller, modern neighbours \u2013 probably\
  \ the reason for us not noticing it earlier. Had we even walked past it distracted\
  \ by other signage?\n\nAt this point in time we were both far too exhausted, hungry\
  \ and thirsty to hesitate further. We approached the sliding doors with curiosity\
  \ and blind trust. Behind the sliding doors were a set of curtains, beyond which\
  \ was the promising sign of a small but busy eatery and a smiling waitress. The\
  \ smell of freshly cooked rice settled any remaining doubt about this place as a\
  \ suitable lunch spot. This is it.\n\nAll the seats were facing the chefs who stood\
  \ in the middle, preparing different types of \u2018don\u2019 for customers. This\
  \ was a type of rice bowl topped with salad and different types of fish \u2013 salmon,\
  \ tuna, fish roe etc. We stumbled with our rudimentary Japanese level in ordering\
  \ our type of \u2018don\u2019 but thankfully the staff was patient and will tolerate\
  \ our juberish and mixture of pointing to pictures and menus. \n\nThe meal was fantastic\
  \ and not just because we were hungry. I had some raw tuna served on salad and rice.\
  \ There was an awkward moment when I realized I gathered the attention of nearby\
  \ customers because I was dipping the fish into the wasabi & soya sauce mix incorrectly.\
  \ Easy fix really. Aside from that it was a great seafood adventure for the two\
  \ of us during a limited 1 hour lunch break from our day as interns. A change of\
  \ plan that worked well for us."
