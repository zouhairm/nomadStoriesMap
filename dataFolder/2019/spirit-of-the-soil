Text: "\"You can\u2019t buy the wind, the sun, the clouds or the rain. You can\u2019\
  t buy my happiness. You can\u2019t buy my pain.\"\n\nThe worn-out guitar she gently\
  \ strummed matched the quiet exhaustion on her face. Her sharp, full-bodied voice,\
  \ however, gave no sign of resignation. She sang freely, the music echoing through\
  \ the expanses of fields and mountains, visible only under the last slivers of moonlight.\
  \ \n\nRoberta was my host mother, a short woman with stern eyes but an effortlessly\
  \ warm smile. She was the 'lonko' \u2013 or chief \u2013 of a tight-knit community\
  \ of indigenous Mapuche peoples in the heart of Chile, one of the only women to\
  \ hold that post in centuries. Although the biggest indigenous group in Chile, the\
  \ Mapuche accounted for less than a tenth of the country\u2019s population and were\
  \ often subjected to intense discrimination from the state. Women from the village\
  \ used to drop by the house every day, recollecting with great admiration stories\
  \ of Roberta's bravery against many a man.\n\nRoberta\u2019s flock of chickens,\
  \ however, proved no match for the matriarch. Every morning they\u2019d invariably\
  \ break out of their rusty old cage, and every morning I\u2019d wake up early to\
  \ help her chase them down, while she\u2019d ramble on about the \u201Centitled\
  \ little menaces.\u201D As we\u2019d herd the birds back, she\u2019d point to a\
  \ funny-looking \u201Cmonkey puzzle\u201D tree in the distance, telling me that\
  \ it was planted by her great-great-great grandfather to protect their land from\
  \ evil spirits. Further off on the other side, a small river coursed through the\
  \ lush foliage. Sometimes we\u2019d spot my host father saying a small prayer by\
  \ its banks before filling up jugs of water for the house. \n\nThe Mapuche peoples\u2019\
  \ land meant everything to them. Their souls and spirits relied as much on their\
  \ beating hearts as they did on the water and earth on which they walked. One evening\
  \ as we\u2019d been walking along the property, Roberta had suddenly fallen to the\
  \ ground in a fit of tears. She wept through the night with muted anguish. She\u2019\
  d discovered that some of her plants had died; the volcanic ash from the Llaima\
  \ eruption had lingered on in the air for days after, cutting off the plants\u2019\
  \ oxygen supply. Not knowing what to say, I just sat there by her side, until drops\
  \ of dew washed off the mud on our knees. \n\nOn this warm night, Roberta had chosen\
  \ to sing a song that her young audience could relate to, but it carried with it\
  \ the same weight and emotional resilience as songs from generations before her.\
  \ She had spent the day in the nearby city of Temuco, meeting with local politicians\
  \ and developers. My broken Spanish and her proclivity for quiet reflection had\
  \ prevented us from having any deep political conversation, but in that moment,\
  \ no words were necessary. She gave me a look that brought shivers down my spine.\
  \ My heart sank with hers. She had failed.\n\nFor several months, the Mapuche community\
  \ had been embroiled in a bitter struggle to protect their land from being redeveloped\
  \ into a hydroelectric plant. The underhanded politics and bureaucracy of land ownership\
  \ had not reached the hundred or so residents of this community, and Roberta was\
  \ the first to find out that the Mapuche people could not \u201Clegally\u201D lay\
  \ claim to the land they\u2019d been living on for centuries. \n\nIt was both intimate\
  \ and uncomfortable for me to be there, on the cusp of what could permanently change\
  \ the lives of an entire people. I felt the depth of their helplessness, shame at\
  \ my ignorance, pain for the family I\u2019d come to love. The little community\
  \ of Curarrehue would be no match for the multinational power company about to destroy\
  \ their ancestral homes, and no number of pi\xF1onero trees could ward off this\
  \ evil. But Roberta held on tightly to her guitar, chin held high. She would fight\
  \ till her dying breath and the Mapuche would stand with her. She remained stoic\
  \ under the starry sky, the last notes of her music wafting away into an uncertain\
  \ future:\n\n\"The struggle breathes here. Here we are standing. You can\u2019t\
  \ buy my life.\""
