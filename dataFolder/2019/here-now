Text: "I was stranded somewhere between Saida and Tyre, in south Lebanon.  Unexploded\
  \ cluster bombs\u2014ordnance from Israel-Hezbollah conflicts\u2014littered the\
  \ surrounding land. My iPhone, connected with a Lebanese SIM card, had no service.\n\
  \nI could walk, I thought. Or I could wait for another bus.\n\nIn Lebanon, there\
  \ is a public bus network\u2014a flimsy current of elongated vans posing as buses\u2014\
  that offer a cheap option for the Lebanese to travel between cities. Riding one\
  \ of these buses had seemed like an authentic, local experience, so I took one from\
  \ Beirut, headed south.\n\nI was going into Hezbollah territory, the small Shia-majority\
  \ town of Tyre, where the yellow Party of God flags snap among Roman ruins and UNESCO\
  \ World Heritage sites. With my Western wardrobe, I\u2019d tried to integrate into\
  \ local culture by wearing a long-sleeved shirt, buttoned up to my neck, over an\
  \ ankle-length black dress, despite the mid-September heat.\n\n\u201CDress conservatively\
  \ on the bus;\u201D \u201CYou pay when you get off;\u201D and \u201CSit in the front\
  \ with other women;\u201D were the bits of advice I had accrued throughout my ten\
  \ day solo journey. I had also heard that the majority of other passengers would\
  \ speak only Arabic, and not the French or English of trilingual Beirutis. The only\
  \ other language I could survive on was Spanish, and over the past nine days, this\
  \ had proved to be irrelevant.\n\nStarting from the \u201CCola Station,\u201D a\
  \ bus stop that was nothing more than a pocket alongside the highway of an unwelcoming\
  \ part of Beirut, I traveled first to Saida, a little town with a sea castle and\
  \ a maze of souks. After a few hours, I found an almost empty van destined for Tyre.\
  \ A local girl with a ponytail, dressed in a long sleeve tee and jeans, sat in the\
  \ first single seat up front. I slid into the double bench across from her. Soon,\
  \ a man joined. He was stubbled, unkempt; a gold chain glistened around the collar\
  \ of his yellow tee shirt. \n\n\u201CSour!\u201D He hollered in Arabic for other\
  \ passengers traveling to Tyre. Between his calls, he stared at me. He sat on the\
  \ console by the driver\u2019s seat, legs stretched forward, eyes leering.\n\nOutside\
  \ the window, midday sunlight glinted off the green dome of Zaatari Mosque down\
  \ the street. Traffic encircled Nejmeh Square, where water danced from a central\
  \ fountain. Once the bus was full, it was 45 minutes to Tyre.\n\nThe woman beside\
  \ me signaled for a stop from out of nowhere. Passing the fare in small Lebanese\
  \ bills, she paid the man and got off. He sat down beside me. \n\nHis leg to my\
  \ leg, he moved in close. I slid to the side of the van, against the window, clutching\
  \ my bag. He turned; he pressed his knee into my leg, cornering me. \n\nHe addressed\
  \ me in Arabic.\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D I snapped. \n\nHe smiled. His teeth were yellow\
  \ like wood, grey around the gums.\n\nFrom the front pouch of my backpack, I crunched\
  \ the loose pounds in my grip. \u201CI\u2019ll get off,\u201D I said.\n\nHe understood\
  \ me perfectly, but he replied in Arabic.\n\nI stood up.\n\nHe stood up.\n\n\u201C\
  Aqu\xED, ahora,\u201D I spat. Here, now, I demanded in Spanish.\n\nHe hesitated,\
  \ and then he said, \u201CHere?\u201D\n\n\u201CS\xED, ahora,\u201D I replied. I\
  \ shoved the bills at him. \n\nHe took the money, stepping backward to give me space.\
  \ He was smiling again, but he stopped the driver and I got out and looked around,\
  \ and then I knew why he had laughed.\n\nI was nowhere. My intentions of a local\
  \ experience hung suspended in a universal dilemma: I was a woman alone, up for\
  \ interpretation, lost in translation. Here, now, I waited.\n\nAnother bus sped\
  \ by. I stretched out my hand to hail it, just as others had hailed the bus I\u2019\
  d rode prior. The driver didn\u2019t stop\u2014the seats were full\u2014but he slowed\
  \ down, squinting at me. I skipped forward and drew back the door of the van, causing\
  \ him to idle. Rows and rows of hijab\u2019d women. I gasped with relief. One of\
  \ them gathered her abaya and moved over. \u201CThanks,\u201D I breathed. \n\nShe\
  \ glanced at me from behind the edges of her veil. Onward, I continued to Tyre."
