Text: "River GangesRishikesh is about 20kms from Haridwar. We took an auto and started\
  \ early for Rishikesh. The dark sky hindered the view, however, and the cool breeze\
  \ was telling us that we were heading closer to the hills. Our 45 minutes journey\
  \ was definitely a delight, especially for Swairik who was sitting on the step of\
  \ the auto\u2026Swapnil with his usual cheerful spirit and clown like acts entertained\
  \ us all through our way. The auto dropped us at Shri Radha Krishna Mandir, from\
  \ where we had to take another vehicle to reach our camp, Alaknanda River Rafting\
  \ Camp located in Byasi, which is approximately 38kms above Rishikesh. Swairik\u2019\
  s foreigner friend Lisa, who was staying at Lavazza Caf\xE9, was supposed to greet\
  \ us at Lakshman Jhula at 6.30 AM. Since it was just 5.15 AM, we decided to take\
  \ a little hike to Lakshman Jhula and other nearby places.We ran and cut through\
  \ the meandering alleys of Rishikesh, which were almost empty at the moment with\
  \ few small dhabas and restaurants open. The first glimpse of River Ganga stunned\
  \ us\u2026WOW! Was all I could say\u2026 I am certainly not a morning person, but\
  \ if every morning would allow me to get such a spectacular view, I might just stop\
  \ sleeping at all\u2026LOL. The emerald green river accompanied by lofty mountains\
  \ takes its usual walk. The pebbled path, along the river added to its beauty. I\
  \ finally dared to soak my feet in the water, Gosh! there was nothing that I can\
  \ compare the feeling with. Just like the Beatles said it\u2026\u201CI\u2019m just\
  \ a child of nature I don\u2019t need much to set me free\u201D\nAlaknanda River\
  \ Rafting Camp\u2026 Sun, Sand and Beach!\n\n At 3 PM, we were finally called for\
  \ river rafting.\nRiver Rafting\u2026 Facing Life\n\nRafting in RishikeshThe adventure\
  \ took a toll on us, the 250m climb up to the main road from Byasi was literally\
  \ impossible without breaking a sweat, and by the time we reached the main road\
  \ we were exhausted. To come to think of it, what a great drawback it is to stay\
  \ in a city, where motor vehicles are available and everything is available at a\
  \ short distance. Alas! We all are falling victims to convenience and comfort, allowing\
  \ our bodies to become delicate and unhealthy. The best thing about hills is that\
  \ it reminds you that it is still possible to live without many amenities that we\
  \ consider necessary\u2026We took a bus, headed for Marine Drive, from where we\
  \ had to start our 24kms rafting expedition. There are four major stretches for\
  \ rafting in Rishikesh, Brahmpuri (9kms stretch for family and beginners), Shivpuri\
  \ (16kms stretch for youngsters), Marine Drive (24kms stretch for daredevils) and\
  \ Kaudiyala (36kms stretch for experts). Anyways, adventure began for Swairik and\
  \ me here as we were the only people who had to take the raft on the opposite side\
  \ of the beach, where rest of the group was waiting. Let me tell you, it is not\
  \ so easy to row a boat anyways and rowing it against the flow takes a great deal\u2026\
  but we managed! Successfully reaching the other shore, we all geared up for the\
  \ final adventure\u2026BIZZARE! We were out of the rapid and were alive! On the\
  \ third major rapid the raft completely turned towards the right, I once thought\
  \ that Swapnil might fall off, but he survived, he was rowing hard, with his eyes\
  \ closed, which made me laugh\u2026he was doing everything he could to survive in\
  \ this particular rapid. By the fourth rapid named Roller Coaster, which was the\
  \ longest, everyone was a bit tired but DAMN the monster rapid put everyone in an\
  \ alert position, Swapnil again rowing with closed eyes and Kapil waiting for the\
  \ tide to come to him, as he didn\u2019t want to row in the air\u2026LOL! I felt\
  \ someone was throwing bucketful of water on me, the warm weather and cold water\
  \ made for a strange combination. It was at least 10 minutes of fast rowing that\
  \ pulled us out of the gigantic rapid\u2026the quite water followed with few minor\
  \ rapids to N.I.M Beach\u2026We had just faced death and lived a life!!"
