Text: "I\u2019ve never lived in London, but it feels like coming home.\n\nI have the\
  \ same feeling whenever I revisit somewhere I\u2019ve been before on my travels.\
  \ That feeling of familiarity, that simple I know this place comfort that makes\
  \ everything so much easier. I know how the transit works. I know how to find cheap\
  \ food. I know where to stay.\n\nAnd while there\u2019s comfort in that, I don\u2019\
  t travel to be comfortable. I travel to get out of my comfort zone. \n\nFresh off\
  \ the plane from Buenos Aires, I\u2019m groggy and jet lagged, but it doesn\u2019\
  t matter, I can navigate the underground in my sleep. Which, if we\u2019re being\
  \ honest, I basically am. \n\nI\u2019m crashing at a friend\u2019s place for a few\
  \ days before I to somewhere new.  \nShe\u2019s a restless traveller like me, but\
  \ she decided to settle for two years in a city she loves. She still loves it\u2014\
  but she\u2019s also ready to leave when her visa expires. There\u2019s so much left\
  \ to explore, so much new.\n\nI\u2019ve stayed places two, three, six months, once\
  \ even a year, but the itch always comes back. The feeling that however content\
  \ I am at the moment, all I can think of is all the things I\u2019m missing. All\
  \ he places I\u2019ve yet to be. All the experiences I\u2019ve yet to have.\n\n\
  After I\u2019ve showered and slept and feel human again, my friend and I go for\
  \ a walk. We stroll along the Thames toward Greenwich, the gold and purple lights\
  \ of the skyscrapers across the river reflecting on the water, making it glow like\
  \ there\u2019s something lurking underneath, fairy lights beneath the waves luring\
  \ you down.\n\nWe exit the wind into a warm, well-lit pub, only to find its quiz\
  \ night and all the seats are taken. I\u2019m scanning the tables when my friend\
  \ gasps and tugs me back outside, blushing furiously.\n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201D\
  \ I ask, already missing the warmth. \n\n\u201CDo you remember a year ago, I went\
  \ out on a tinder date with a guy, and afterwards I called you and said reminded\
  \ me of you?\u201D\L\n\nI nod slowly. She\u2019d said if I\u2019d lived in London\
  \ she\u2019d have introduced us. But I didn\u2019t, and it would have been weird\
  \ to be like \u2018hey, I have a friend who comes through here once in a while,\
  \ I think you\u2019d get along,\u2019 so nothing ever came of it.\n\n\u201CHe\u2019\
  s in there.\u201D She laughs a little. \u201CMy god, what are the chances? I haven\u2019\
  t seen or thought about him in a year, and of all the people I\u2019m with when\
  \ I see him again, it\u2019s you.\u201D\n\n\u201CQuite the coincidence,\u201D I\
  \ agree\n\nIf this were a book, or a movie, people would call it fate. They\u2019\
  d say we were destined to meet. Tonight would be the awkward first encounter that\
  \ would start the rom-com.\n\nBut this is not a movie or a book. This is real life.\
  \ \n\n\LShe sighs. \u201CIt\u2019s a pity you\u2019re not here longer.\u201D\L\L\
  \n\n\u201CWould you introduce us if I were?\u201D\n\nShe laughs. \u201CMaybe? Would\
  \ that be awkward? Hey, dude I went on one date with, remember me?\u201D She shakes\
  \ her head. \u201CAnd in front of his friends? I suspect he\u2019s too British for\
  \ that to go anything but politely awkward.\u201D\n\n\u201CProbably.\u201D I agree.\n\
  \nShe smiles sadly. \u201CDo you want me to introduce you guys?\u201D\n\nI give\
  \ it serious thought. I admit, I am curious what this person is like, that she remembers\
  \ him a year later as someone I\u2019d get on with. But eventually, I shake my head.\
  \ \u201CI wouldn\u2019t stop you if you did, but it seems a little pointless. I\u2019\
  ll be gone soon.\u201D\n\nHer smile is knowing, but a little sad. She wants this\
  \ to go differently, I know it. But there\u2019s no other way it can go.\n\nSo we\
  \ turn away from the pub and continue our walk along the shoreline as the glittering\
  \ lights of the city shine down on us. There are some experiences you just can\u2019\
  t have without staying still. But as the possibilities unravel behind me, I don\u2019\
  t have any regrets. I\u2019m looking forward to my flight in a few days, and the\
  \ siren song of the next place I\u2019ll explore."
