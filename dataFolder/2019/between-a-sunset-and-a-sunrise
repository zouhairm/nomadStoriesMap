Text: "While contemplating all of the workload that was going to drive me into oblivion,\
  \ I thought again of the offer that she had come to me with; my roommate. I couldn\u2019\
  t resist the shine in her eyes that reveled the stories of her excitement, and taking\
  \ a split second to consider the two choices I had, I decided I could procrastinate\
  \ work for another weekend. Reluctantly, I responded in the yes. We were going to\
  \ Jabal Jais, the highest mountain peak in the UAE. \n\nI did not have the slightest\
  \ idea about what I was to expect from this adventure. The one thing I was sure\
  \ of was this; I was not getting a wink of sleep Friday night. And so after a long\
  \ day of work, we set off on a 6 hour long journey that was going to take us into\
  \ lands unknown. The best part about the travel was that it was all after dark,\
  \ and that was an experience that was some would say, quite rare an experience for\
  \ me. My coming to this country was an adventure, and the day I had landed here\
  \ was the day the unexpected had started to happen.\n\nAfter two hours of the journey\
  \ and fifty some odd minutes of walking, we reached the meet-up point. There were\
  \ more than a few faces that were new to me. Little did I know that this adventure\
  \ would leave them all feeling like family by the time the night was up. The new\
  \ faces were not the end of the surprises for the night though, because we only\
  \ went a little further to discover that we were to ride in a Mustang. On the dark\
  \ and deserted road of Dubai, I looked around for signs of unicorns walking, and\
  \ maybe also some other forms of impossibility, one that would give me the slightest\
  \ inkling of this situation being merely a dream.  \n\nA few minutes of my rummaging\
  \ into my head for clues of impossibility, I discovered that I was actually going\
  \ to ride in a sports car for the weekend. After the mind had accepted what was\
  \ real, it was just a matter of keeping up with what was going on, and so a party\
  \ of four got into the mustang, while three rode in the other car, which was a Lexus,\
  \ no less fun too if I may add.\n\nAnother surprise that awaited us showed up a\
  \ little higher off the sea level, where we were greeted by a slight drizzle, while\
  \ journeying up the mountain. The rain got louder and faster as the journey progressed,\
  \ and our plans looked like they were going to remain merely plans.\n\nOur car came\
  \ to a halt at the highest bar-b-q spot that was on the mountain, and we got out\
  \ of our cars to get feelers of whether the rain would hinder our plans for the\
  \ night. That was the time when loud music rang far and wide into the dark valleys,\
  \ with all four doors of the Lexus open wide. While the rain came pouring harder,\
  \ we rushed to set up the tent we had packed along, arguing and quarreling while\
  \ the process went on. \n\nAfter the tent was done, the home cooked food was brought\
  \ in, and thus happened the dinner of seven at 3 in the morning. While the memories\
  \ of the dinner seem perfect in retrospect, the dinner itself was not, for the various\
  \ orifices of the tent gave way to pouring water, which came dripping down on us\
  \ all through dinner. \n\nWhile we resumed our wait in the cars to see if the rain\
  \ would subside, the playful teasing and story-telling continued through the night.\
  \ The rain finally said its farewell and we set up for bar b q, while a guitar was\
  \ playing on the neighboring bar b q pit. So in the midst of all of the chatter,\
  \ and the quarreling, and the smoke that rose from the coals, we waited for the\
  \ sunrise; at the highest peak of the UAE. So once the sun did show up, it was a\
  \ sight to behold, absolutely mesmerizing; magical no less."
