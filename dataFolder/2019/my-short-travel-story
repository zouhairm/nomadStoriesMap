Text: "I had a moment of realization while gliding through the air on the flying fish\
  \ (pictured above) in Kuta Beach, Bali.\n\n\"This is the best feeling ever! What\
  \ have I been missing out for the past 3 years?\"\n\nThat was the first time I flew\
  \ out of Singapore in three years, and the first trip abroad with friends.\n\nA\
  \ trip that changed my life.\n\nBefore that last minute trip (we made the decision\
  \ a day ago), I\u2019ve never given much thought to travelling.\n\nThroughout my\
  \ childhood, I\u2019ve travelled probably once a year with my mum and brother, staying\
  \ in the nearby regions of Asia and Australia.\n\nUntil 2011, when I was called\
  \ to serve the nation and my precious annual leave were saved for whatever activities\
  \ a 20-year-old thought were cool.\n\nOh boy, what a bad choice. I never knew what\
  \ I gave up.\n\n\nSince that Bali trip in 2014, I\u2019ve caught the travel bug\
  \ and been in and out of Singapore seven times each year for the next two years.\n\
  \nThe two craziest years of my life - striking off item after item on my bucket\
  \ list, meeting people from all over the world and pushing myself out of my comfort\
  \ zone, trip after trip.\n\nI\u2019ve jumped out of a plane in Brazil, dived in\
  \ the beautiful oceans of Malaysia, ran off a cliff in Vietnam, scaled the highest\
  \ volcano in Indonesia, took a helicopter ride above the majestic Angkor Wat temples\
  \ in Cambodia and couchsurfed in Australia.\nI\u2019ve travelled solo in multiple\
  \ cities, travelled as an uncle with my adorable nephews, travelled for the first\
  \ time with my father in 25 years, travelled with lovers, travelled with friends\
  \ old and new, and even travelled for free, with a 5-star hotel stay.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve gotten lost, gotten robbed, gotten sick. Been drunk on the streets. Starved till\
  \ I couldn\u2019t speak. I\u2019ve cried and smiled, loved and lost. And yet I yearn\
  \ for it more: The feeling of plunging into the unknown. The freedom that comes\
  \ with exploration and living each day to the fullest. The feeling of waking up\
  \ every single day excited.\n2016 was a year of laying low. As I watched my friends\
  \ enjoying their University exchange life in various countries, I took a hiatus\
  \ from travel. Instead, I made sacrifices \u2013 in my studies and social life.\n\
  \nWhile I stayed at home and in school, felt dead inside and unintentionally surrounded\
  \ myself with negative-thinking and scarcity-minded people, I slowly bided my time.\n\
  \nI started an internet business that gives me the freedom to work from anywhere\
  \ in the world. I learnt self-defence to protect myself on my travels. I even took\
  \ Spanish and Salsa classes. All for my dream of returning to South America one\
  \ day.\n\nEven though friends have asked, I never gave much thought to writing about\
  \ various short, scattered trips with no real focus.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe day I\
  \ booked a one-way ticket to Brazil.\n\nWith no return date, I decided to travel\
  \ slowly and fully immerse in the local culture of each of the South American countries.\
  \ I decided to record this journey from the perspective of a Singaporean.\n\nIt\
  \ is finally my turn to travel.\n\nAs I type this on the plane ride from Lisbon\
  \ to Rio de Janeiro, I want people to know that travel is not limited to short,\
  \ unfulfilled weekend trips. I want people to know that it is possible to live a\
  \ life of your dreams. I want people to know that it is a matter of the choices\
  \ you make daily.\n\nI do not subscribe to the notion that we are born to study,\
  \ get a job, pay off debts and die. I believe it is possible to live a life of freedom\
  \ and enjoy the beauty of this world at the same time."
