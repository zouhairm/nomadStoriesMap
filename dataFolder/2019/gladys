Text: "We decided to take a break from eating traditional Japanese food. It was day\
  \ four of our Tokyo adventure and our palettes yearned for something familiar. We\
  \ dove head first into plates and bowls of fresh sushi, ramen, and noodles. \n\n\
  We were reaching our Japanese food burnout threshold.\n\n\u201CLook, a Hooters,\
  \ \u201C I said to my wife. I was pointing at a google search for \u2018American\
  \ food in Tokyo\u2019 on my phone. \n\nShe smiled and shook her head, affirmatively.\
  \ Hooters is located in Shibuya, a Far East cousin to NYC\u2019s Times Square. We\
  \ happened to be a few blocks away from Hooters; we were hanging out at the local\
  \ hedgehog cafe. \n\nA few minutes later, we arrived at Hooters. The hostess escorted\
  \ us to our table.\n\n\u201CGladys will be your server,\u201D said the hostess.\
  \ She pointed at a thin, black woman balancing trays of buffalo wings and fries.\
  \ \n\n\u201CMaybe she is an exchange student from England.\u2019\u201D said my wife.\n\
  \nGladys arrived at our table with the same curious look we possessed. She was warm,\
  \ insecure about her English speaking ability, and gracious about our inability\
  \ to speak Japanese. \n\n\u201CAre you from......here?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201C\
  Yes, I\u2019m from here,\u201D she said sheepishly.\n\nShe peeled off some of the\
  \ layers of her identity and shared them with us. She was half-Ugandan. She didn\u2019\
  t know her father but she assured us she was O.K. She was a student. She was an\
  \ only child.\n\nWhile she served us, we told her about our hometown, Atlanta. And\
  \ how we were hosting the Super Bowl-this Hooter\u2019s location was having a super\
  \ bowl party. She and my wife talked about hair; they share a similar hair texture.\
  \ We laughed about our tourist experiences in Tokyo.\n\nWe felt like we made a friend.\
  \ There was an enthusiasm we shared about our exchange. We created a bond. I couldn\u2019\
  t explain it at first. But when I looked at all three of of our melanin enriched\
  \ hands resting on the table, I realized it. We all have Africa in common. A place\
  \ we are all connected to but not necessarily apart of. \n\nBeing different in an\
  \ such a racially homogeneous place can feel lonely.  There is a part of you that\
  \ feels like you can never truly fit in. And when those people who are different\
  \ but in a similar way come together, a camaraderie happens.   \n\nA few days later,\
  \ we ran across Gladys which is remarkable considering that Tokyo is a huge, megametropolis.\
  \ We stopped her and chatted for a few minutes. As she walked away into the abysmal\
  \ crowd of her fellow Japanese nationals who looked nothing like her, I wondered\
  \ if meeting us made her feel any less lonely."
