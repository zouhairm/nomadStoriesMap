Text: "I can tell by the looks on people\u2019s faces as I drag my roller bag up the\
  \ sloping street past closet-sized shops selling fresh tortillas and the table-and-a-plastic-chair\
  \ nail salons, this is not a place that gets a lot of foreign tourists. \n\nOne\
  \ would think my bucket list trip to Michoac\xE1n would be meticulously planned,\
  \ but in fact, this was the most hastily organized and under-researched adventure\
  \ I\u2019d ever attempted. Back home in Maine, snow banks as tall as fifth-graders\
  \ were losing their novelty, so a message from a friend suggesting I visit her in\
  \ Mexico was deliciously tempting. Realizing I\u2019d be traveling right past the\
  \ monarch butterfly sanctuaries during their peak season, I jumped online, bought\
  \ tickets for a week later, and pulled out the \"everything will work out fine attitude\"\
  \ I\u2019d picked up a few years before while traveling India.\n\nI was following\
  \ the blue GPS dot on my phone as it approached 20 de Noviembre, the main road closest\
  \ to my destination. Though I\u2019d received confirmation of my booked room, my\
  \ host never answered my last request for directions from the bus station. It was\
  \ past sunset now and quite dark out, the border between mountain and sky barely\
  \ visible, the bus lit only by occasional oncoming headlights and a red glow emanating\
  \ from behind a large crucifix mounted above the windshield. A leathery skinned\
  \ man in a battered cowboy hat who had smiled at me before--the kind of smile you\u2019\
  d give to someone wearing a giant banana costume--began to make his way to the front,\
  \ hooting to the driver to let him off. I made a snap decision to follow him down\
  \ the aisle, quickly grabbed my luggage and stepped from the bus onto the side of\
  \ the road, grateful for the luck I\u2019d had so far.  \n\nIt is only now, as I\
  \ plod up the hill, so obviously conspicuous, that I begin to worry a little. With\
  \ assertion and nervousness, I turn left and continue down a wide, empty street\
  \ until the blue dot aligns with my accommodation. Above, the lushness of a tree\
  \ obscures the street light and conceals the source of lively bird chatter, a pleasant\
  \ daytime sound that is surprisingly unnerving at night.  Below the tree, a closed,\
  \ unwelcoming gate blocks a long dirt drive.\n\nI think of the monarchs. They\u2019\
  ve traveled even further than I have to get here. How do they do it?\n\nI try the\
  \ latch, and to my relief, it isn\u2019t locked. Reaching the end of the drive,\
  \ through the windows of a spacious sunroom I can see a large television flashing\
  \ scenes of Vikings and an older couple sitting in front of it, their backs to me.\
  \ \n\nI knock. Again, expressions on faces make it clear that they are not at all\
  \ expecting me. Ingrid, a native of Germany who\u2019s lived in Mexico for decades,\
  \ and her husband Jos\xE9 are seemingly baffled when I show them my confirmation\
  \ email. Cycling through flustered English, Espa\xF1ol, Deutsche, Fran\xE7ais attempting\
  \ to communicate, none of us can seem to find the right words in the right language.\
  \ Ingrid goes to a phone on the wall and dials. I work out that her daughter in\
  \ Mexico City is the English speaker and in charge of the bookings, and that not\
  \ only do they not typically rent during the week, but none of the rooms are for\
  \ a single person. Yet here I am, rolling solo, knocking on her door at 9pm on a\
  \ Tuesday. Eighteen hours of continuous travel is threatening to devour my last\
  \ bit of composure. \n\nIngrid hangs up and leaves the room. Returning with an armful\
  \ of sheets, she leads me outside towards the guest rooms where she skillfully makes\
  \ up a bed in a room with four in it.  As she goes she speaks. I understand \u201C\
  desayuno\u201D and \u201Cocho.\u201D Breakfast. Eight. \n\n \u201CSi, gracias!\u201D\
  \ \n\nThen, like the grandmother she is, she pats my cheek, \u201CBuenas noches!\u201D\
  \  \n\nAs I fall onto the fresh sheets in my family room, the stress I\u2019d been\
  \ subduing for hours turns to tears. \n\nThen I relax. Everything has worked out\
  \ fine. I\u2019ve made it. And tomorrow, I am finally going to see the butterflies."
