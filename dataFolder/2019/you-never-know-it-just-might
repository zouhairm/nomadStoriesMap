Text: "I have never flown. First time ever, I am on my way to Morocco. My heart thinks\
  \ it is love. My mind is another matter. The flight over was a 13 hours. Very long\
  \ but no problems arose. I was overwhelmed at the tv charging bay and everything\
  \ about flying. I naturally packed too much and as I arrived in France for my 4\
  \ hour layover was fumbling with too much for a little woman to carry. Had no idea\
  \ where I was going. Needed to be on otherside of airport to catch my plane. By\
  \ time we all got through customs search because security was tight as was a bomb\
  \ scare day before. We missed our flight. Is a very good idea to pull up a diagram\
  \ of the Airport you're flying into. If I had I would have found info on a shuttle\
  \ drives from one side to the other. I Can speak little French. Is hard to ask questions\
  \ when dont know how. Finally found my way and somewhere I could get coffee and\
  \ a danish would take USD. Got stationary, charged my fone, contacted my love and\
  \ told him my fone was dying and I wouldnt be able to find him if it didnt charge\
  \ enough in the air. Pleaded make sure he met me directly where we disembark the\
  \ plane. \nWe fly from France In the most beautiul blue sky as far as you can see.\
  \ Up over the clouds for few hours. By then was around noon. Truly looks as cotton\
  \ out the window goes on forever. Was announced would be landing soon and a few\
  \ seconds later could see land. Was remarkable seeing how the land is petitioned\
  \ off. Not only in America but in other Countries as well surprised me. See the\
  \ farms in the red red dirt. I realized then why they called it Maroc in France.\
  \ Is so red. Flat forever. We land. I disembark. No boyfriend I go get luggage,\
  \ No boyfriend. I was trying to find him when my fone died. I told him to meet me\
  \ immediately.\nHe didn't. I was terrified I had just flown 5 thousand miles and\
  \ he was nowhere to be found. Finally a kind vendor man helped me to charge my fone\
  \ and contact my boyfriend. I dont know what he thought when he saw me. We ran toward\
  \ each other and sure enough cracked each others heads and just laughed. Uncontrollably,\
  \ or what seemed. He couldn't believe I was finally there and I couldn't believe\
  \ I flew 5000 miles to see him. I was elated. Then saw the beauty of this Grand\
  \ Country!\nPalms everywhere once we exited the Airport. We had a taxi driver take\
  \ us to the bus station in Casablanca where we would catch our bus to Merrakech.\
  \ We spent the night at Hotel Hicham. We laugh because was my boyfriends name. Hotel\
  \ staffman took my passport and I was scared. But I was told is normal. We slept,\
  \ got up next morning, ate and needed another taxi to Ouirgane where I had rented\
  \ us a beautiul three bedroom two bath home on Barrage Ouirgane. Hicham Had some\
  \ trouble gettting a decent price. I am not a rich woman. All wanted too much he\
  \ said. He also told me all think we are very well off. So charge more if think\
  \ a person has money. After about 2 hours haggling realized he wasnt accepting a\
  \ crazy amount and we started out. 20 miles down road we had a flat tire. Was actually\
  \ in a beautiful spot. Was a huge rock many had written graffitti on we took pictures\
  \ playing and acting silly while the driver fixed the tire. Was a farm led up into\
  \ the Atlas Mountains we so wanted to explore but no time we needed settled. We\
  \ made most of it and took so many pictures. Was a splendid ride. Finally arrived\
  \ little town of Ouirgane. On the border of the Atlas Mountains. A beautiful lake\
  \ town. With a Restaurant, Hammam(Bath house), Butcher and Grocer. Everything we\
  \ needed as far as I was concerned. The next two weeks were sublime. Never knew\
  \ such a wonderful experience."
