Text: "Face covered. My eyes are watering because of the blinding wind. My smile beams\
  \ under the Arctic gear. Imagine hard metal pounding in your ears, while hard metal\
  \ plows through the waves. I am a Viking armed with a camera. Covered from head\
  \ to toe in winter gear, I\u2019m still the coldest I\u2019ve ever been.\n\nI woke\
  \ up pretty early that morning to join the whale watching cruise. The boat would\
  \ travel 2 hours into the Arctic, north of Troms\xF8.\n\nThe spray taints the windows\
  \ of the ship with salty droplets of freezing ocean water, while the tour guide,\
  \ a Biology student doing his Ph.D. on whales, tells us how every fin pattern is\
  \ as distinct as a fingerprint. If we spot a whale, he says, we should send any\
  \ pictures we take to his organization and fill their database. He also explains\
  \ how the waters around here are rich with herring. So much so that orcas (or killer\
  \ whales) don\u2019t feel the need to kill humpbacks for food. They live together\
  \ peacefully around these parts.\n\nOutside, there was only white light shining\
  \ through an icy blue sky. The cold winds seemed to make even the sun too shy to\
  \ take a peek at the whale hunters armed with DSLRs and smartphones below.\n\nInside,\
  \ I was napping before I suddenly woke up. I could feel that something was up. Maybe\
  \ it was due to my whaling ancestors. No one had said anything, but I could smell\
  \ them. The whales are here. Though I won\u2019t be collecting whale oil today,\
  \ a few good pictures and some video footage are good enough.\n\nAll the passengers\
  \ get on deck. Someone screams. A group of orcas breaks through the surf and go\
  \ back down again. Then, a great fin cuts through the water. The wind is so strong\
  \ it\u2019s hard to look through the viewfinder on my camera. Is my focus off or\
  \ my eyesight? Maybe both.\n\nThe boat moves forward until the captain finds a new\
  \ spot and we wait for a little more. The sea snakes through the fjords from the\
  \ horizon to our stout vessel. All I can hear is the sound of waves crashing on\
  \ the boat\u2019s twin hulls until suddenly our Ph.D. student yells: \u201DHumpbacks!\u201D\
  \n\nA mother and child spray Arctic water through their blowholes into the air.\
  \ The boat sails after them as they swim in the freezing sea. Their spraying salt\
  \ water starts to feel like a kind of greeting. The humpback whale is one of the\
  \ largest animals in the world. Like an iceberg, I only saw a fragment.\n\nThe humpbacks\
  \ aren\u2019t popping up anymore. The boat stops. One minute. Two minutes. Ten minutes.\
  \ The whales have gone. Whatever light we had is fading now. It's time to go back.\n\
  \nOn the way to Troms\xF8, I had the most satisfying nap I\u2019d had in years.\
  \ I think you could blame the cold on that. I had been to the edge of the world\
  \ and back. When my ancestors hunted whales, they would only sail in warmer climates.\
  \ These were places where killer whales helped the whalers stalk and kill their\
  \ prey, but I came back with a different kind of bounty. In my father\u2019s own\
  \ words, no one in their right mind would want to venture to such freezing temperatures,\
  \ but I did. Even though I almost froze permanently, I don\u2019t regret it."
