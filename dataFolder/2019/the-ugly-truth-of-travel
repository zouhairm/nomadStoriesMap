Text: "Egypt is somewhere I've always dreamed of going, yet I never really expected\
  \ to venture there in my travels and I'll tell you what I didn't expect to have\
  \ the experiences I did there. I didn't expect the friendly people, the relaxed\
  \ atmosphere and incredible food. The one thing I didn't expect to find: food poisoning\
  \ and a month long bout of gastro. It is safe to say it made Egypt an unforgettable\
  \ experience. There's nothing like being in a country for less than 24 hours, meeting\
  \ your tour roommate and the first thing you say to her is \"My name is Simone and\
  \ I currently have gastro.\" Good one, Sim. She pretty much held my hand through\
  \ the whole two weeks in Egypt and Jordan while suffering along with me. This is\
  \ definitely one side of travel that no one discusses but here I am discussing the\
  \ incredible experience I had in Egypt that was clouded by gastro and some minor\
  \ food poisoning. There is literally nothing more exciting that driving through\
  \ Giza with the pyramids in the background and the bus aircon drying the sweat that\
  \ you're not sure is from gastro or the dry Cairo heat even still I loved it. Theres\
  \ nothing better than being on a Felucca sailing down the Nile for two days and\
  \ hoping the toilet boat isn't too far away because you're clenching your butt cheeks\
  \ hoping its only a fart. Sounds gross, totally was. Besides that, the Felucca trip\
  \ was totally life changing and not just because of the gastro. I have never had\
  \ such a relaxing two days filled with friendship and fun. It was probably my favourite\
  \ experience of the whole trip. I didn't expect to stop for lunch and have a splash\
  \ war or a soccer game on the banks of the Nile with the local Nubian kids who couldn't\
  \ speak English. It comes in a close second to fangirling over Hatshepsut's Temple\
  \ or Deir el-Bahri. That really knocked my socks off.  \n\nEgypt continued to bow\
  \ my mind and not just because I survived gastro the entire 10 days I was there\
  \ plus the 5 days I spent in Jordan following it. Especially after just about every\
  \ person I knew at home told me that I shouldn't go to Egypt because to quote my\
  \ father 'I'd get blown up'. Cheers for the racism, dad. Thats one thing travel\
  \ as taught me, live your own life and don't let the fears of other or in my case,\
  \ the gastro and food poisoning, stop you from doing something. I can honestly say\
  \ that there were so many unexpected experiences in Egypt which ranged from climbing\
  \ inside the Great Pyramid to sailing down the Nile and snorkelling in the Red Sea.\
  \ Now that was an amazing experience that I didn't expect in Egypt. Who knew they\
  \ had coral reefs and a gigantic Blue Hole? This girl definitely did not. I'll tell\
  \ you what though, gastro and snorkelling, not always a great mix especially when\
  \ there's only one exit and that involves swimming the length of the reef to get\
  \ there. Also, here's a handy tip, don't let your butt accidentally touch the reef\
  \ because you're too busy watching free divers, it hurts and causes a rash that\
  \ itches. That added to the unexpected list in Egypt.\n\nTo sum it up, I'm making\
  \ Egypt sound like a horrible place because I was sick the whole time and ten hour\
  \ bus rides with gastro are not enjoyable but it was probably one of my favourite\
  \ countries and experiences to date. I didn't know what to expect besides monuments\
  \ and incredible history yet I got to snorkel a beautiful reef, ride quad bikes\
  \ through the desert, sail down the Nile on a traditional boat and eat a bunch of\
  \ Falafel(potentially my favourite food now) and see a bunch of things I never thought\
  \ I'd see in this lifetime. So I didn't expect to find a wicked case of gastro but\
  \ this girl got it but I also made some lifelong friends (we're planning a reunion)\
  \ or some amazing experiences I'll remember forever (sharing a bathroom with another\
  \ gastro sufferer is not included in that)."
