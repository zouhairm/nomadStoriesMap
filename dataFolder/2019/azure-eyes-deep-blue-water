Text: "I remember his face. His smile was warmer than the gentle sun. The corners\
  \ of his lips flowed through to his azure eyes, brighter and more alive than the\
  \ chorusing river we were about to charge down. His skin was a dark honeyed brown\
  \ and his shoulder-length hair was even darker still, rugged and adventurous. \n\
  \n\u201CHabla Espanol?\u201D The first words he spoke to me. Soft, gentle, curious\
  \ \u2013 all the things I would learn he was. \n\nI felt myself smile. \u201CMm\
  \ no... porquito.\" I held up my thumb and forefinger barely an inch apart. \n\n\
  \u201CBa\xF1os, cervaza, por favour.\u201D Toilet, beer, please. I laughed, trying\
  \ to list the small Spanish words and phrases I had picked up along my journey.\
  \ I had travelled to Central America with my little brother. He wanted to immerse\
  \ himself in the history of Mayan culture through the ruins of Chichen Itza, Copan\
  \ and Tikal, while I wanted to experience the wildlife and nature of Costa Rica.\
  \ \n\n\u201CIs okay, I speak English ... a little,\u201D he winked at me, also holding\
  \ up his forefinger and thumb.\n\nHe told me his name was Adrian as he tucked a\
  \ canary yellow helmet over my head and pulled a life jacket tight around my waist.\
  \ He was a guide on our white water rafting adventure down the Pacuare River.\n\n\
  I stepped aside as he suited up my brother with a similar red life jacket.\n\n \"\
  You are hermanos? Family?\" Adrian asked and my brother nodded. \n\n\"I am your\
  \ new brother-in-law,\" Adrian thrust his hand towards my brother, gesturing a handshake.\
  \ It took us both a moment to realise what he had said. My brother looked at me,\
  \ confused. If he accepted this handshake would he accidentally agree to marriage\
  \ between his sister and a stranger?\n\n\u201CYour sister, she is beautiful. I will\
  \ marry her,\u201D he said, flashing a coy smile in my direction. \n\nI couldn't\
  \ help but laugh and shake my head. \u201CI\u2019m flattered,\u201D I told him,\
  \ \u201Cbut I cannot marry you.\u201D \n\n\u201CMaybe I will ask again, and you\
  \ will say yes?\u201D\n\n\u201CMaybe.\u201D\n\nThe river, wide and opaque, weaved\
  \ through the gorge. Flanked by towering mossy green walls, our rafts crashed and\
  \ splashed with each turn. \nHe stayed true to his promise, asking me after each\
  \ adrenaline-inducing rapid whether I would marry him. Every time he had me in fits\
  \ of laughter with his creativity and persistence. \n\nWe came to a lull between\
  \ rapids. The serenade of birds and wildlife amplified, no longer drowned out by\
  \ rushing water and excited screams. \n\n\"Swim here!\" Adrian motioned.\n\nAdding\
  \ to the euphony of human bodies hitting water, I jumped into the deep aquamarine\
  \ river below me. \n\nHe held out his hand and pulled me onto the front of his kayak\
  \ in one swift, effortless movement. \n\n\u201CWhere do you go to?\u201D he asked.\
  \ \u201CAfter this?\u201D\n\n\u201CI'm going to San Jose.\u201D Our final destination.\
  \ I could tell it was not the answer he wanted as soon as the words left my lips\
  \ \n\n\u201CI go back to Monteverde,\u201D his tone was heavy, disappointed. This\
  \ is where we had come from. \n\nI felt my heart drop. We spent ten minutes of rapid-free\
  \ serenity sharing stories about our lives. It only left me wanting to know more\
  \ about this sweet Costa Rican.\n\nA wicked smile encapsulated his entire face and\
  \ his brilliant blue eyes flashed mischievously. It was hard to remain disappointed\
  \ about the shortness of our time together when there was still so much adrenaline\
  \ coursing through my veins.\n\n\"Hold on,\" he picked up my hands and placed them\
  \ on the side of the kayak. I gripped the handles. \"Do you trust me?\" \n\n\u201C\
  Do I have a choice?\u201D I asked playfully. I did trust him though. I felt safe.\
  \ \n\n\"Hold your breath!\" He flipped the kayak upside down, the top half of my\
  \ body plummeting into the cool river.  \n\nAfter a few moments we flipped upright.\
  \ I laughed and gasped for air all at once, wiping my eyes and pushing my sticky\
  \ hair from my face. He was laughing hysterically. \n\nI remember that moment. I\
  \ remember his azure eyes dancing in the reflection of deep blue water. Those four\
  \ hours stay affectionately in my heart."
