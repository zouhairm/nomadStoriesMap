Text: "Arms and ankles covered with a non form fitting dress, I enter the classroom.\
  \ \u201CGood Morning Tee-sha Nia\u201D.  My students are excited to see their 45\
  \ min a day English teacher, and greet me with enthusiastic curiosity.  Today\u2019\
  s lesson is the usual, review of the alphabet, recognizing images via a hide and\
  \ go seek flashcard game, and the biggest take away, high five\u2019s.  Reliability\
  \ helped in Barcelona, fearlessness helped in Senegal; genuineness helps here in\
  \ Thailand.\nI got on a plane from New York City in April of 2018 with my guitar,\
  \ 2 suitcases and no expectations.  As an avid traveler, I jumped at the opportunity\
  \ to become an expat and live by myself across the world, completely out of my comfort\
  \ zone.  26 hours later, I was greeted by humidity, aromas of food and a bustling\
  \ city filled with tuk-tuks and street food.\nThe assimilation period was emotional,\
  \ lonely and exciting simultaneously, yet seemed to never end. Working with other\
  \ English speaking foreigners was stimulating, yet the connections and surface conversations\
  \ weren\u2019t enough for me to feel included abroad.  However, after 3 months of\
  \ teaching Kindergarten students, a void had been filled.  My students were the\
  \ connection to Thai culture and communication with the native people; a connection\
  \ that had yet to be initiated on both sides because of inherent and learned misconceptions\
  \ of outside nationalities. \nComing from a country where tensions and differences\
  \ are at an all time high, the lack of representation in a Southeast Asian country\
  \ felt isolating.  Furthermore, various cultural groups have made their mark in\
  \ Thailand taking part in corruption, fueling negative sentiments and charging disengagement\
  \ amongst locals and foreigners.  Thai is also a language only used in Thailand,\
  \ so communication was quite difficult for me.\nAs the semester went on, I would\
  \ continue to find solace in speaking with my students; them excited to show off\
  \ their English skills, me animating their confidence. I did not expect that this\
  \ daily contact would eventually be what I needed, but it turned out that the innocent\
  \ curiosity of 4 year olds is powerful.  During the last week of the semester, parents\
  \ began to shyly approach me with smiles and head nods, a custom sign of respect.\
  \  I was given gifts, asked about where I came from, how I was enjoying Thailand\
  \ and what were some things I have experienced here so far.  Parents also asked\
  \ advice on how to get their children to express themselves in English outside of\
  \ the classroom and looked to me for guidance on how they could help their child\
  \ become more confident in speaking English.  Within this week, parents gave me\
  \ Thai language crash course lessons, chatted and practiced their English with me\
  \ and, thanked me for working with their child.  Both the school teachers and parents\
  \ became more comfortable speaking with me, saying Sawadeekah (hello in Thai) and\
  \ smiling. They gave me Thai language crash course lessons, told me the best ways\
  \ to get around the country and I became more familiar with my school and it\u2019\
  s surrounding areas.  \nThese connections were all unexpected but everything that\
  \ I need to continue my journey as a true expat."
