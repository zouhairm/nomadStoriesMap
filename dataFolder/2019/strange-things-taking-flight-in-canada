Text: "From the road, it must have looked like we were flying above the churning powder\
  \ blue water of the river, 40 feet below. Our effort to shave off several miles\
  \ from the hike taking us from the Canadian Icefields Parkway to the icefield above\
  \ for two weeks of climbing lead us to use a steel cable that had been put in place\
  \ by the park service, for the same purpose that we had in mind, to save time. But\
  \ they had a cable car locked by a chain on one end, leaving us to use carabiners\
  \ and climbing harnesses to pull ourselves through the air above the standing waves\
  \ of the river below. We were noticing cars pulling off the road at the bend in\
  \ the highway, off in the distance. From there, they could not have seen the cable,\
  \ just us in flight.\n\nAs we crested the rise at the top of the trail, there was\
  \ a massive pile of broken rock and what looked to be two overgrown white medicine\
  \ capsules. If you were feeling ill, went to the pharmacy for medicine, and opened\
  \ the package, it would have looked just like these two capsules. They measured\
  \ about twenty feet long and served as our shelter for the next several days as\
  \ we climbed local peaks.\n\nOff to the side of the capsules was an outhouse, perched\
  \ on the rocks, looking out over the expanse of the icefield. Where normal cultural\
  \ etiquette would dictate that a closed outhouse door meant that the privy was occupied,\
  \ we established a local rule, that tying the door open would indicate that the\
  \ single seat throne had been taken. This would give the occupant a private room\
  \ with a view, across the ice that was the remaining westward expanse of Alberta\
  \ before it dropped steeply into British Columbia.\n\nLiving on the icefield, the\
  \ only sounds came from us. No hum of machines or buzz of crowds. There weren\u2019\
  t even any trees for us to hear the wind rushing through. This was just quiet. That\
  \ quiet was interrupted one morning when we heard a thump, thump, thump, of a helicopter\
  \ coming up the valley, landing 100 feet from the capsules which had become our\
  \ temporary home.\n\nTwo men and a woman climbed out of the helicopter before it\
  \ flew back down the valley. They were probably as surprised to see us as we were\
  \ to see them. About 15 minutes later when the helicopter flew back up the valley,\
  \ their story was confirmed. Hanging in a sling below the helicopter was a brand\
  \ new loo landing right in front of us.\n\nThe crew was very personable as we explained\
  \ our admiration of the view from the open door of the current outhouse. We managed\
  \ to convince them to set the new shack to have the door face across the icefield.\
  \ They must have thought that we were crazy. But as long as it was no extra work\
  \ for them, why not play along with our silliness. I\u2019d wager that they went\
  \ home with stories of their day at work as unexpected as our stories were from\
  \ that day. They removed the old shack and they capped off the old remnants below\
  \ it.\n\nWith their work here complete, the helicopter returned, the crew flew back\
  \ down the valley, and our surreal day came to an end. The quiet had returned and\
  \ we had a new privy. The extreme juxtaposition of the helicopter, outhouse, and\
  \ crew could just as well have been a dream, as it was so out of place. \n\nIf you\
  \ find yourself on the Icefield Parkway and you are looking for a restroom, maybe\
  \ you should consider a day hike up to the icefield. If you do, tie the door open\
  \ and take a moment to relax to the beauty and immensity of the view through the\
  \ open doorway. Don\u2019t forget to give thanks to the crew that installed this\
  \ room with a view and maybe even to the folks who convinced them to spin it a bit\
  \ to give you that view to take your breath away. You are welcome!"
