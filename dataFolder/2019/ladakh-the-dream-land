Text: "And wind started blowing, and soon it rested in my face. Smell was familiar,\
  \ and I realise soon, they are from the north. \nThere was not a single clue to\
  \ start my journey, but as they say, \n\u201CAnd, when you want something, all the\
  \ universe conspires in helping you to achieve it\u201D. While traveling through\
  \ one of the roughest route, nature protected me from all the barriers and severe\
  \ cold. And soon I encountered with the magic of Universe. Stars shelted the dreams\
  \ and mountains recreated his hope. \nIt was September of 2016, I started my journey\
  \ from delhi to Himachal , and I saw a mile stone, Leh 491km. And in a blink of\
  \ an eye, I feel the magic which I lost long back. As if there is some kind of magnet\
  \ which has a divine force, stronger then gravity itself. \n\nDusk of September\
  \ 9th 2016, the moment I realise I need to go some unknown place, and without having\
  \ a second thought the very next day, I was in Kasol. Maybe it was deodars, maybe\
  \ it was mountain or maybe river. Whatever it is, the phone which haven't in use\
  \ past 3 months played a important role. \u201DHow can you cry, when you are in\
  \ such a beautiful place\u201D. And silence continued. Don't do some stupid task.\
  \ \nCannabis of malana, that's what I heard, but that place is much more than that.\
  \ Call it a intense buzz, and maybe that's how I began to lose every materialistic\
  \ attraction and start recalling every single thing which was there in illusionary\
  \ past. \nAnd beginers luck helped me. Think once more, do.you really wanted to\
  \ do this, a friend who putted every possible effort to stop. \nAfter traveling\
  \ hundreds and hundreds mile, at 4 am in the morning, I reached the place which\
  \ I heard of. Where should I leave you, and my tongue murmured a only name which\
  \ I knew. \nAs if it was omen, the small girl in green trouser and black sweater\
  \ run towards north, and vanished in a bilnk of an eye. Illusion or reality i don't\
  \ know but now i know the direction. \nSo you have told me this place speak your\
  \ story, so i will ask the mountain, wind of maybe the stones. What if they tell\
  \ me. \n\nAnd after a year, I received a call. Manaas, where are you, I saw a dream,\
  \ I saw you. Are you in Ladakh? A call from a beautiful soul with whom I encountered.\
  \ And that's how I found my magic moment."
