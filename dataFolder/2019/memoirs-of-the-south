Text: 'My father died when I was a child. I knew he had family in Long Island, so
  I went searching for a connection. Before I moved, I met my current boyrfriend that
  I met three years ago in New Orleans. We were both from Alabama: in the heart of
  the Bible Belt, both very poor, conservative, oppressive, and infamously racist
  small towns. I was going to move to NY for family, and then he got a full scholarship
  to Skidmore. Over time, we have moved in together we now live in Saratoga Springs,
  NY. The town is only a few hours away from almost anywhere in the North East, and
  is only 2 hours away from the Canadian border. Since I have access to a free education,
  I am studying Spanish and Anthropology as a Videography minor. Additionally, I am
  taking an intensive ESL course that will enable me to teach English in other countries.
  I like to travel and talk about my experiences and pair them with travel photography.
  I try to add a picture with a story as a writing experience everyday and to relate
  my to everyday life. My topics typically focus on world, culture, social consciousness,
  and mental health awareness. I see the world in a delicate light, and I hope to
  one day connect with others to have a global impact.'
