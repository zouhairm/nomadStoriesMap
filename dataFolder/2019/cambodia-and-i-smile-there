Text: "Arriving at Phonm Penh, getting out of the airport immediately looked for Tuk\
  \ Tuk, transportation in Cambodia which was quite expensive when it was opened and\
  \ because I went alone so the transportation equipment was quite expensive, but\
  \ it didn't matter because cheap or expensive costs could not pay how happy until\
  \ the country becomes a tourist destination. \n\nWow, unique for vehicle number\
  \ plates here, why can it vary and use the City name on the license plate?\nI asked\
  \ enthusiastically to the friendly Tuk Tuk driver to me.\n\nOf course, because there\
  \ are many areas here as a sign of the origin of the area.\n\nIn the Hostel, just\
  \ checking in and I went straight to the next destination, namely Killing Field\
  \ by hiring a Tuk Tuk that drove me from the airport to the Hostel.The road to get\
  \ there is still very arid and dusty, it is recommended that you want to go there\
  \ with a mask and drinking water.\n\nThe trip is quite far and passes through residential\
  \ areas, I can see that there is still a lack of awareness of local people about\
  \ environmental cleanliness. During in the Killing Field I can witness the remains\
  \ of mass graves and human skulls in the tragedy of the dictator Cambodia's mass\
  \ slaughter, Pol Pot, scary when imagined in that era. The next destination is the\
  \ Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, a place where former schools are used as a place of\
  \ torture for Cambodian people, which they call \"Hell on Earth\u201D.\n\nNext day\
  \ visiting the king's palace and silver pagoda. The palace with a unique building\
  \ characterizes Cambodian culture. Silver pagoda is located in the area of the king's\
  \ palace, this pagoda has a floor covered with tiles made of silver and each tile\
  \ weighs up to 1 kilograms. While inside the palace stands a Buddhist statue made\
  \ of gold with ornate diamonds weighing 90 kilograms. The main attraction in Phnom\
  \ Penh is that there is a road on the other side that has a flowing river, and in\
  \ front of the palace there is a large park that has many flying pigeons, but unfortunately\
  \ on the roadside many people beg for tourists.\n\nI tried talking to some local\
  \ people and wanted to know a lot from them about Cambodia.\n\nHello, can you speak\
  \ English?\n\nAnd they answered in their language, Oh my God I dont understand.\n\
  \nThe third day of the trip to Siem Reap which took quite a long trip, 6 hours.\
  \ When I arrived at the Hostel I checked in and headed to the room, there was nobody.\
  \ 10 minutes later a traveler also arrived from Portugal, and just arrived in Siem\
  \ Reap and we got to know each other. Not long after telling stories, there were\
  \ two roommates from Sweden and Australia, both of whom had stayed a few nights\
  \ at the Hostel. We took a short break and in the afternoon visited Pub Street.\
  \ \n\nI have to sleep fast and not forget to activate the alarm so I can wake up\
  \ at 4.00 am because at 5 o'clock must be at Angkor Wat to watch the sunrise. \n\
  Angkor Wat is one of the most beautiful relics of the Hindu kingdom in the world.\
  \ The temple built in the 12th century has an area of 400 square kilometers, so\
  \ it is not possible to just visit for a while in the temple area, because from\
  \ the main temple there are other temples scattered in this area. \n\nDuring my\
  \ walk at Angkor Wat, I met a lot of travelers from various countries, very happy\
  \ and happy who couldn't pay anything. Because true happiness is when we can walk\
  \ with our feet where the direction can make us smile and realize that this world\
  \ is beautiful and I must visit. Solo traveling can teach me to be a person who\
  \ is more independent and can appreciate time, because we don't know whether we\
  \ can visit that country again or not. Cambodia is a country that is still improving\
  \ to become a comfortable country for tourists. The community is as friendly as\
  \ the Southeast Asian community in particular."
