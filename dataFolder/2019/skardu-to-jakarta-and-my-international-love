Text: "I am the only female traveler from a place in the North of Pakistan, which\
  \ is very diverse and backward. When I travel people see me like if I am a clown\
  \ but still I travel a lot because I am a traveler and my name 'Saira' means Traveler\
  \ which gives my more strenght. Whenever I feel down because of the people's and\
  \ societal pressure, I think about my name 'Saira' ahh ( I love to call my name\
  \ again and again) and I move forward and I travel. I am a travel blogger, I am\
  \ a photographer as well who captures the nature and share with the people and motivate\
  \ them to travel specially girls.  People here see differently if a girl travels\
  \ alone and I am a solo traveler where people associate traveling with the 'Men'\
  \ only and don't accept a girl who travels and consider them rebels and I am happy\
  \ to be a Rebel. I need my own company and attention to travel deeply and observe\
  \ the things around me. \n\nI am going to share the story of my first international\
  \ trip to Jakarta where I found 'True Love'. \nI got selected for a training in\
  \ Jakarta on 'Investigative Journalism'. I was very excited to see a new place and\
  \ to meet new people across the world as I call myself 'Global Citizen' and I don't\
  \ believe in borders. The training was so hectic and after attending the sessions\
  \ 8 am to 6 pm, I would sit around the pool which was located on 6th floor of the\
  \ hotel's terrace. The place was mesmerizing, I would sit at the bank of pool putting\
  \ my feet inside, seeing moon and talking to moon. \nOn third day of training, I\
  \ was sitting on my favorite place, a guy came out and sat near me and we started\
  \ talking. While talking I came to know that he fears to sleep alone so he spends\
  \ his night at terrace near the poor. We talked about the training, his married\
  \ life, his daughter and all at the end I asked if it was love marriage then he\
  \ said that he doesn't believe in Love, ''Love doesn't exist'' he said. But I was\
  \ a true believer of Love. I couldn't persuade him. Most of the time we spent together\
  \ I told him about my culture my people and my Mountains where I belong and where\
  \ I breathe deep and he told me about his country. We would go to bar, we would\
  \ ride bicycle around the city at night and sometimes we would go so far that we\
  \ forgot our way back to hotel. We stayed up last 2 nights and didn't sleep all\
  \ the night. \nLast morning when we all were leaving for our homes he called me\
  \ near the poor and gave me a flower and said \"Saira I started believing in Love,\
  \ Thank you and I don't know what's this but I am feeling something different which\
  \ I never felt. I Love you. I don't care if you love me or not if I could get you\
  \ or not but I just know, whenever I close my eyes I will meditate you, I really\
  \ Love you'' \nIt was a very different experience for me. I don't know what do I\
  \ feel for him but I really respect his feelings. Traveling' taught me to respect\
  \ humans and their feelings. I found that love unconditional, he didn't want anything\
  \ from me his love was so pure for me which I could feel. despite a lot of difference,\
  \ cultural, religious and two people from different countries, he dared to love\
  \ a different girl from mountains.\nJakarta made me meet amazing people and gave\
  \ me True Love. I know we can't meet but I will remember and respect this Love forever."
