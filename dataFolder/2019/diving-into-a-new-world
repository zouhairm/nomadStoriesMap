Text: "Nothing can prepare you for the first time that you go outside of your country.\
  \  Is even more special if it comes together with the longest trip of your life,\
  \ crossing an ocean, going to another continent. Together with the excitement, a\
  \ fear. What can I expect? Will I arrive safely? Am I going to enjoy it? \n\nBy\
  \ the window of the plane, I didn't see only the landscapes passing, but my life\
  \ too. So many things were into my head, my thoughts burning up. But, I wasn't going\
  \ to regret it. I needed to face whatever it would come. \n\nMy fears disappeared\
  \ when I saw a gorgeous beach with the most beautiful sea I ever seen. My eyes got\
  \ wet with tears of joy. The dream of a lifetime came true!\n\nItaly was the first\
  \ (and the most quickly) stop of the trip. It was there that I realized: I'm not\
  \ in Brazil anymore. I was hearing people talking on a different language of mine\
  \ (despite being an english speaker, is a bit scary). A mixture of sounds, tastes\
  \ and smells were taking all of my senses. So distinct and powerful! And it was\
  \ only the beginning of the adventure.\n\nAfter, I went to Netherlands, and was\
  \ there where the journey really started. After arriving at Schipol Airport, Amsterdam,\
  \ I took a train to a city named Amersfoort. When I dropped off the train and took\
  \ the taxi to the hotel, I discovered that I was going to stay in another city,\
  \ Soest, a rural and charming place. What?! The two cities are so close that is\
  \ a bit difficult to figure out when you're in Amersfoort and when you're in Soest.\
  \ \n\nAmersfoort took my heart! The historical center, with more than 700 years\
  \ of existance, reunites the past, the present and a possibility of the future.\
  \ In front of the Koppelpoort gate, with the essence of the medieval castles, the\
  \ fairytales I used to read in my childhood became reality together with the colours\
  \ used by Mondrian in his art. Not by coincidence, he was born there. The flowers,\
  \ so traditional in Netherlands, were covering the city together with a lot of green\
  \ trees, and the powerful colours of them certainly were reflected on Mondrian's\
  \ work. Close to the ancient gate, a lot of modern stores. A lot of bikes (normal,\
  \ is Netherlands), but not so much traffic. So different from where I am from!\n\
  \nThe people of the city, so kind with me and my family, are another positive point\
  \ of Amersfoort. Always (well, almost always) when I needed help, they helped. Of\
  \ course, I met some disgusting people through this journey. Is the life! No matter\
  \ if you are in China, Australia, USA or South Africa. You will ALWAYS find someone\
  \ dislikeable. But nothing that you cannot turn the tables on and deal with it.\
  \ \n\nThe food is amazing too (stroopwafels are one of the greatest things I ate).\
  \ The markets were a paradise, despite not being very cheap (don't worry, is still\
  \ cheaper than a restaurant). Is the only thing I have to complain, I think. And\
  \ the place, so clean and charming, is delightful.\n\nBetween some visits to another\
  \ Dutch cities, like Utrecht and Amsterdam, I spent four days in this place. I went\
  \ away from Amersfoort incomplete, because part of me was left on the city. I wish\
  \ to come back some day and enjoy more.\n\nI dove into a whole new world. It was\
  \ a leap into the unknown. And I could not be more happier of living that moment."
