Text: "There are some moments in life in which you simply feel aligned, aligned in\
  \ such a way, you can feel or understand changes that are to come. This happened\
  \ to me precisely before travelling to Ecuador in 2015, I felt blindly ready for\
  \ a revolutionary jump. \n     It is often said that trips are not so much about\
  \ the places you go to, but the people you meet along the journey, sometimes, it\
  \ can actually be both, but truth be told, it is always about one's self, for it\
  \ is you who must be open enough to allow experiences in and through. \n     I travelled\
  \ to this South American country with a mashed up group of friends, we were seeking\
  \  for adventure, fun and beaches and that was exactly what we got and, at Monta\xF1\
  ita, our very first stop, we became a party hit. It was precisly there that I met\
  \ the person who would not only switch my trip around, but my entire mind paradigm.\
  \ It was love at first sight if you may, or at least one of those connections highly\
  \ intensified by those narrower travelling limits of space and time.\n     He was\
  \ from a far away land (relative facts I understand, but I can say we lived as further\
  \ away as two people could ever live) and everything related to the way we met seemed\
  \ to be taken out from the deepest pages ever written within myself. \n     We almost\
  \ bumped into each other at the all-popular-street/beach-Monta\xF1ita-New Year's\
  \ Eve-party. He was with two friends, I, having strolled away from my group, was\
  \ all alone. We all talked, they were funny, I was clever, he liked me, I liked\
  \ him. They were \"living\" there, had some musical project, I was interested, we\
  \ kept chatting and then they had to leave, he squeezed my arm as they did. I stood\
  \ there feeling light headed. We ran into each other again at that party, I could\
  \ tell he wanted to reach me, but I was dancing, he didn't dance. He left again.\
  \ \n     I remember going to bed that night feeling oddly lured towards him. I had\
  \ to see him again, for some larger motive I ignored...\n     It did not happen\
  \ on the next day nor night. It was on my last couple of hours there that we bumped\
  \ into each other again. Our eyes met and  we just went for it, it was as if we\
  \ already knew one another. I had been waiting to meet him, he was a key for something\
  \ else. Everything made sense. \"Will I see you again?\", I had to leave, was moving\
  \ to my next destination in Ecuador, \"I don't know\". We both turned to look at\
  \ the other as we parted ways...\n     My journey continued with my friends and\
  \ a larger group of people we adopted during our stay. I felt spaced out, like when\
  \ after listening to seriously loud music, my insides were buzzing, my heart was\
  \ thumping, I was excited, and realized soon that I HAD to go back. \n     We kept\
  \ on moving upwards, snorkelling in Puerto Lopez, passing through Manta, staying\
  \ at Canoa. There was a week left on our journey, and instead of going with my group\
  \ to Ba\xF1os, I decided it was time to go back to Monta\xF1ita. It must be said,\
  \ that me and this guy had not exchanged no phone number no social media profile\
  \ nor anything, I had but a rather blurry name I wasn't truly sure about. I was\
  \ completely following my intuition, this HAD to happen. \n     I parted with my\
  \ friends and got on a night bus. I knew where this guy was supposed to live, but\
  \ I didn't feel like knocking on his door or anything. I minded my own business\
  \ and found a spot at the beach for myself, a spot that was actually on the opposite\
  \ side to where he was meant to be. I spent the day sun bathing and reading, when\
  \ the sun began to set... And then I see him, right in front of me, he had come\
  \ out to play some frisbee or something. And he sees me back. Both of us startled.\
  \ And again, that smile of recognition."
