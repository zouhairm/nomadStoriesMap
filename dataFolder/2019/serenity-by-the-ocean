Text: "All it took was a leap of faith and spontaneously, my ticket to go visit another\
  \ country was purchased. After 2 long years and saving up all my tips from my minimum\
  \ wage paying job, I finally had enough money to go explore outside my small town\
  \ in New Brunswick, Canada. After arriving, I immediately new I was where I was\
  \ supposed to be. The first night I leaped into the ocean, encased by water and\
  \ \n stars. I felt at peace for one of the first times in my life. After having\
  \ a mild fear of the ocean for most of my life, I didn\u2019t fear anything at all\
  \ in this moment. The ocean was a part of me and I was a part of the ocean. Lying\
  \ on my back, I gently moved my arms in unison with the small waves. Many times\
  \ in my life I wished that I could stop time. My promise to you is that you can\
  \ stop time. Time has no restrictions when you are at peace with how it moves. The\
  \ ocean gave me this peace, I did not care what time it was, I did not care how\
  \ many minutes or hours were passing by, all I cared about was how I was feeling\
  \ and the beauty I saw before my eyes."
