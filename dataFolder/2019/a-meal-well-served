Text: "Sitting in the most picturesque Thai kitchen I found myself staring at a deliciously\
  \ looking jam-and-fruit covered toast and a mixed feeling of longing and embarrassment\
  \ washed over me. The young woman that cooked exclusively for me and my travel companions\
  \ every morning stood happy in front of me, believing she had finally found a food\
  \ I would eat after refusing all the traditional thai recipes she conjured to the\
  \ table the days before. \nMy suffering had begun the moment I set foot in this\
  \ country and was of simple origin: I could not handle the food. After having a\
  \ first innocent spoonful of a watery but good-looking Tom Yam Gung soup at the\
  \ airport my unprepared self involuntarily began coughing and sweating from spice\
  \ - much to the joy of my companions but fueling my deepest fear - I had just proven\
  \ myself to be a dumb \u2018farang\u2019, a westerner who was not capable of the\
  \ culture and therefore excused to observe to general rules. Exactly what I did\
  \ not want. \nSpiciness had always been a border for me, I never dared to cross\
  \ and so the drama unfolded. Of all the things I liked to complain about: the humidity\
  \ during rain season, the striving for harmony by the locals around me that made\
  \ me so uncomfortable sometimes and my inability to communicate sufficiently with\
  \ hand and foot when there was no English-speaking person around, the food was my\
  \ worst nightmare. It was not just the spice, I loathed the smell of the numerous\
  \ small stalls along the road, colorful food trucks and tricycles in front of golden\
  \ temple rooftops and did not dare go near them for fear the quite exquisite aroma\
  \ made me buy and bite into something that I would later regret. \nI had been nibbling\
  \ on fruit and surviving on sticky rice with mango the last couple of days and my\
  \ mood grew worse with every meal especially since everyone else around me seemed\
  \ to be enjoying the versatile cuisine. During the last few days I dreaded the two\
  \ more weeks of travelling that lay before me, where I would inevitably have to\
  \ eat local food since we planned on visiting a friend in a remote untouristed area\
  \ where \u2018mai phet\u2019 (no spice) was not an option, as I had been warned.\
  \ \nNever will I forget the moment of my mind change. The sun was shining between\
  \ the dark wooden pillars of the old town hotel where flags in vibrant colors would\
  \ hang between fast growing bamboo. The garden was already growing into the kitchen,\
  \ which was an open space and served as wall-free dining room and lounge at the\
  \ same time. And now the good girl in her traditional outfit with a long red woven\
  \ skirt had seen me suffer and decided to prepare some toast for me to make me feel\
  \ better. I was deeply embarrassed and decided it would be time for a change. \n\
  I did not give the food a second chance but gave a second chance to myself. I asked\
  \ for a surprise Thai breakfast the next day which made me receive one of the biggest\
  \ smiles and sat down a little fearful 24 hours later. I should have known better\
  \ because I got one of the best meals I had until today even though I still do not\
  \ know what exactly I was served. My deep plate was full of a kind of paper-thin\
  \ homemade rice noodle sheets in a delicious curry with bits of savory meat sticking\
  \ out, a bit sweet and salty at the same time. Of course, it was spicy, but I had\
  \ found out I could handle it by focusing on the great flavors among it rather than\
  \ fearing a burnt tongue. From then on, I brought myself to try every meal even\
  \ if I would not finish it. In the end it had all been in my head and during my\
  \ travel I discovered a whole new world."
