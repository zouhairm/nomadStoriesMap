Text: "Honking horns, air that smells like fire and large grey clouds that reveal\
  \ a huge cross in the distance- a sign of a sacred ground. My first thought is \u201C\
  this is hell\u201D, as I walk through the center of Skopje, the capital of the soon\
  \ to be called Northern Macedonia, a country cursed by its past, present and future.\n\
  \nApproaching one of the most popular places of Skopje, the old Turkish bazaar I\
  \ stumble on its cobblestone, the same pavement that has been walked on by the Byzantines,\
  \ the Serbs, the Bulgarians and the Ottomans, and by every emperor who wanted a\
  \ taste of the Balkan\u2019s \u201Capple of discord\u201D. \nOnly few kilometers\
  \ long, this bazaar shows a joyful clash of the two most opponent religious beliefs,\
  \ the Christianity and the Muslim religion, together hand in hand like a jigsaw\
  \ puzzle. These narrow streets seem too tight for the mix of Slavs, Turks, Roma,\
  \ Aromanians, Albanians, who in their historic love and hate relationship have been\
  \ known to show real manners only when it comes to one thing - drinking. One drink\
  \ is the key ingredient to the war and peace in the Balkans and it is called rakia.\
  \ \n\nIn a cold winter it seems like the only option, so I enter a bar that welcomes\
  \ me with the picture of the socialistic Yugoslavian leader known as Tito. Gazing\
  \ at his enigmatic smile I start drinking my warm rakia.  It takes only one sip\
  \ to swirl around the country\u2019s troubled past, two sips to see the welcoming\
  \ goodness in the eyes of the Macedonians and a third one to fall in love. \n\n\
  I continue with my walk in the direction to the marketplace. This is a place where\
  \ elegance is forgotten, it is a land of simplicity, shouting laughs and an unexpected\
  \ boom of tastes and colors. Fruit, vegetables, spices, bloom with tastes that could\
  \ be every chef\u2019s dream. No one knows their real value and this biological\
  \ heaven is one of the tastiest and cheapest in Europe. \u201CPeppers hotter than\
  \ your wife\u201D, a sign says jokingly attracting everyone around, people laugh,\
  \ tell jokes and gather around the second epicenter of the fun in Skopje \u2013\
  \ the food. \n\nI continue to the center of the city that reveals the country\u2019\
  s \u201Cbeauty makeup\u201D full of controversial monuments and nationalistic messages\
  \ that add up to the conflicts with the neighboring countries. This is not unusual\
  \ though, as a matter of fact the Macedonians are used to being enslaved, humiliated,\
  \ undermined (even by their own people), and yet their eyes glow with charm and\
  \ a wish to find a solution for a better life.  Conservative lovers and world travelers\
  \ in the same time, Macedonians are obsessed with world trends and stylish clothing.\
  \ They are friendly, smart, easygoing and joyful.  These people are the third and\
  \ the most important asset of this land. They are what makes Skopje a welcoming\
  \ home for all. To be invited for a lunch at a Macedonian home means that one should\
  \ be prepared to eat and drink to infinity and back. How can it be that this hidden\
  \ gem is so unknown to the world? In fact some very magnificent people come from\
  \ these lands like Mother Theresa, the Michelin star chef Rene Redzepi and many\
  \ others, but somehow the general population rarely even knows how to find this\
  \ country on a map.  \n\nThe name Macedonia has been a controversial matter for\
  \ more than two decades. It has been connected to the concept of victory and power,\
  \ though the republic that I know has not had hardly any victory since its existence.\
  \ It however (no matter the name) knows about enjoying life in its simplest way.\
  \ It is a place to go to when sad, a place to retire and even a reality-retreat\
  \ for those who seek the meaning of life. Most importantly this is a place where\
  \ everyone is welcome. I act like a tourist in my city and I understand that this\
  \ is the closest to a sacred land a man can be, not in a sense of a fancy religion,\
  \ but as a sweet relief for the soul."
