Text: "Twisting and turning down the dimly lit rues and avenues, my face was hot with\
  \ excitement and disbelief and the strained effort of trying to remain calm.  The\
  \ taxi driver dropped us off in front of the apartment, laughing at me as I worked\
  \ to suppress an American Psycho smile.  After mercis were exchanged and my efforts\
  \ of coolness shattered, the cab left and Jody and I sat on our suitcases, waiting\
  \ for the key-bearer of our apartment to arrive.\n\nAs we sat, I swore that the\
  \ air was making me loopy - sweet and smokey and new.   I watched the boots of a\
  \ young, well-dressed, twenty-something as they clacked down the street...music\
  \ to the neighborhood\u2019s ears that played sounds and songs of all kinds.  The\
  \ foreign streets of Paris had hit me like a classic I\u2019d never heard, but that\
  \ stirred something familiar and comforting, with the static of the needle on the\
  \ record and all it\u2019s ridges.  The man and woman slowly passing under the yellow\
  \ glow of the lamp post were the sweet, dragging, saxophone. The loud group of locals\
  \ laughing and yelling over bottles of wine were the drums. The beautiful, shiny-haired\
  \ Parisian was the bass - her heels on the pavement keeping the rhythm of the city\
  \ in perfect stride.\n\nDuring the time we had, I made it our mission to fall into\
  \ that stride.  With no schedule, and an unspoken agreement to do as the Parisians\
  \ did, we casually studied our surroundings and copied everything we saw.   Lips\
  \ reddened with wine and lipstick, we traipsed into the nights guided by the desire\
  \ to blend in and to feel loved by a city so sexy.  Maybe we wouldn\u2019t be loved\
  \ back, but we didn\u2019t mind much settling for pleasure.  Thus, we set out to\
  \ consume everything we liked - from food to art to people - anything to digest\
  \ the attractiveness of it all. \n\nLike a long dream, bits and pieces got lost\
  \ in the moments, days and nights bleeding together in a mix of indulgence and imitation.\
  \  Each day was welcomed with a cafe au lait and a bready pastry and each night\
  \ we closed with drunken laughs, dancing to the band on the street corner after\
  \ feasts of cheesy risottos and lots of Lactaid, followed by gelato in the shape\
  \ of a flower.  \n\nWhether because we looked vaguely Eastern-European or, perhaps\
  \ because of our pitiful attempts to communicate in the native language, the Parisians\
  \ welcomed us into their warm, little bars and restaurants, cafes and clubs.  On\
  \ the last night, we sat perched on a firm, blush red couch inside a local spot\
  \ where we could hide from the reality of returning.  Loneliness swept over when\
  \ Jody became engrossed in conversation with a man who mistook her for Swedish,\
  \ and I turned to stare at the pretty people for comfort - legs dangling over bar\
  \ stools, coats tossed to the side, drinks in hands and drinks in mouths.  \n\n\
  A man with a guitar strapped around him parked himself in the booth adjacent and\
  \ began to strum as if the chords were an integral part of his communicating.  While\
  \ the other patrons continued on with their conversations, the singing man looked\
  \ into my eyes with the unguarded smile of a 5 year old asking me to play.  \n\n\
  \u201CCome on! You know the words! Sing with me!\u201D he said.  Shyly, I complied,\
  \ and the lyrics hesitantly flowed out of my mouth.  \u201CLouder!\u201D he commanded,\
  \ and louder I sang.  Guitar in hand, the 5-year-old man transformed into a conductor\
  \ before my very eyes - setting the tempo, melting my self-consciousness away and\
  \ unifying the entire corner of the bar, until we were all performers of a Jason\
  \ Mraz chorus, minus the fedoras.\n\nAs I made eye contact with the smiling strangers,\
  \ the rhythm of the city picked right up where it had left off. The sax, the drums,\
  \ the bass and, us - the chordal instrument with the differing notes that played\
  \ all at once. The Parisian Jazz quartet that pulsed through the city streets, now\
  \ pulsed in my veins in perfect harmony, leading me to believe that I ate Paris\
  \ whole."
