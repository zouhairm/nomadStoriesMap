Text: I just turned twenty, I was on my to Portugal from Hawaii, where I am born and
  raised. I had won a trip for a story I wrote, about wanting to travel to Portugal
  to meet people from my Roots, from where my people came from, little did I know
  that i would be meeting my father for the very first time by accident. Yep walked
  right in to him at a local bakery in the streets of Cambria, he bought two loafs
  of bread and walked up to me and said in english have some bread ,you remind me
  of something, I asked really! cause I'm looking for history of my family, told him
  where I was from, he started to cry and handed me his wallet I was confused, I wasn't
  robbing him he said open it , there was a picture of my mom and older sister and
  the man, she was about one years old when our father left, and me still in my mothers
  tummy now, that was the first person I met can you believe it! He had been deported
  and had no way to contact my mother and thought it would be best after many years
  to just forget about that life and pray she would live a good life with out him,
  he didn't know about  me, he said my mom was the most beautiful woman in the world,
  and he could never remarry even though they weren't married. My mom had passed away  and
  that s why I wanted to see where we were from, my sister and I visit as often as
  we can. Seek and you shall find.
