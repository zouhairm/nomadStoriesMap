Text: "I hit a semi head-on a month after winning my 1st cage fight. Two years after,\
  \ I had the itch to fight again :) I needed to get my body back into fight mode.\
  \ \n\nI had maintained contact with a man (Travis), I met at a seminar at Master\
  \ Toddys Muay Thai Camp in Vegas.  Master Toddy had since moved to Bangkok and started\
  \ a new camp. Travis suggested I go to Bangkok with him for training. I had learned\
  \ so much in Vegas and wanted to fix my tattered body. I was far from normalcy and\
  \ even further from the fighter I wanted to become again. So, what do I do?    \
  \ \n\nHead to Bangkok of course.\n\nA year later in December, Thai Summer, I left.\
  \ I stayed in a bungalow at the gym. It had everything I needed. I became a gym\
  \ rat. I trained 2 hours in the morning, 2 hours at night, slept, repeat...for a\
  \ month.  It was hot, hard, and awesome. Master Toddy and his wife treated us like\
  \ their own little Muay Thai Family.\n\nBangkok is confusing for a small town girl.\
  \ The sky train is a wonderful asset. I ate at the same few places, trained, and\
  \ went to fights. \n\nWe went to the famous Lumpini Stadium, which seats 9,500,\
  \ and it was packed. Thais love Muay Thai. It\u2019s the national sport, like football\
  \ is here. Kids grow up boxing to make money for their poor families. \n\nThais\
  \ may not have much, but they are the kindest, helpful, most genuine people.  Whole\
  \ families live in tiny, little rooms. \n\nI went to a ton of fights by Master Toddy\u2019\
  s students.  Most are foreigners who live, train, and fight for the gym.  All fights\
  \ are pro and for money. The gym gets a cut for training you and you get a cut.\
  \  A fight is really something to see.  There's no doubt you're going to see blood.\
  \ Knees and Elbows are vicious. The crowd gets into a betting frenzy that is ongoing.\
  \  You must be careful not to make a gesture that would obligate you to participate\
  \ in the bet.  There are always crowd favorites and a headline fight. \n\nMuay Thai\
  \ is a true art form. You start with the Wai Khru. Wai is an action of Thais to\
  \ show respect.  The fighter performs the Wai Khru by circling the ring three times\
  \ before kneeling and bowing three times as a sign of respect to God. He also bows\
  \ to Buddha to ask for protection for himself and his opponent and for an honourable\
  \ fight. Each fighter performs the Ram Muay on each side of the ring to demonstrate\
  \ his prowess and control to the audience. The Ram Muay is a personal ritual, and\
  \ contains clues about their trainer and where they are from. The fighter may wear\
  \ a headband called a Mongkhon and armbands known as Pra Jiad during the ceremony.\n\
  \nWe went to the Floating Market. It\u2019s literally floating. You travel from\
  \ place to place, stand to stand, by boat.\n\nThe Erawan Museum we visited next.\
  \ It is unique and an elaborately created museum and temple combination. It\u2019\
  s just a few kilometers away from Bang Na BTS station. Convenient. The most prominent\
  \ feature of the Erawan Museum is the gigantic 3 headed elephant that weighs a total\
  \ of 150 tons! It\u2019s def something to see.\n\nThen, Ancient Siam. A 320-hectares\
  \ \"city.\u201D The grounds of Ancient Siam correspond roughly to the shape of the\
  \ kingdom, with the monuments lying at their correct places geographically. \n\n\
  I also went with my Muay Thai family to get tattoos. They do it in clear ink.  Knees\
  \ for strong knees, elbows for strong elbows, the back of the hand for strong punches.\
  \ You\u2019re probably thinking what\u2019s the point? Well, they are done by Monks\
  \ and it\u2019s blessing. That is why you see so many fighters all tatted up. They\
  \ are truly blessed ;) \n\nLast my big 30th Birthday. Slightly depressed because\
  \ I wasn\u2019t where I wanted to be at point in my life.  But hey, I was in Bangkok\
  \ :) We had a blast. Went bar hopping, dancing, ate, drank ;) It was definitely\
  \ a Birthday I will never forget."
