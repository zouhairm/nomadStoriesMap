Text: "There is 22 years old Italian girl, who graduated, and everyone expects her\
  \ to find a job, find a house, move with her boyfriend and become an adult. And\
  \ she wants it to, until one day she realizes that life is not supposed to be like\
  \ that. And so she leaves, she books a flight with all the money she earned during\
  \ the university years and she flies to Pacific Beach, San Diego, California. She\
  \ lives and works in a hostel, a small and colorful hostel right on the beach, full\
  \ of crazy and amazing people. She learns how to listen, and she does it very well\
  \ that everyone in the hostel, guests and workers, want to share their stories with\
  \ her. She learns to surf, and she loves it. The days in the hostel are always different,\
  \ each day is a new story, a new discover, new friends. Every single person she\
  \ meets has an amazing soul. And then, of course, she fells in love. But she is\
  \ scared, she has to leave the USA because of the visa, and she doesn\u2019t know\
  \ what to do. And when she doesn\u2019t know what to do, as she always did, she\
  \ starts to write. And she writes all the story from the very beginning."
