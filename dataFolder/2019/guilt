Text: "The farm was an impossibility \u2013 an attempt at organic agriculture on a\
  \ barren outcrop in the Klein Karoo. Its German owners were liberal but bitter,\
  \ avoiding visits to town, ignoring the locals, refusing to learn Afrikaans. I caught\
  \ the two of them kissing early one morning \u2013 they jumped apart and walked\
  \ away separately. The reason they\u2019d come to the desert was ambiguous. I suspect\
  \ they were married to other people.\n\tMy own reasons were stupid enough. I\u2019\
  d followed a Capetonian I met in London. She called our first few days in South\
  \ Africa an \u2018abortion of a weekend\u2019. I still had three months before I\
  \ flew back home so I found myself somewhere remote to punish myself. The desert\
  \ was a perfect blend of quiet nights and fruitless labour.\n\n*\n\nThe Germans\
  \ had one employee, an old man called Opa (\u2018Granddad\u2019) who they pitied.\
  \ Opa was small, shrivelled and placid. He could carry about twice as much earth\
  \ as I could. We used cigarettes to communicate whilst working, since my only Afrikaans\
  \ came from a tatty children\u2019s book. Opa was patient and gracious.\n\tIt comforted\
  \ me to watch him work. He worked without urgency but still managed more than his\
  \ share. He took his wages back to his family, who lived a mile down the road. He\
  \ seemed perfectly free of pain. \n\tHe allowed me to condescend that we were more\
  \ alike than we were the Germans.\n\n*\n\nAfter a month, when it was suggested I\
  \ move on, Opa invited me to visit him at home. I was by now soaked with sobriety\
  \ and loneliness. Knowing he liked a beer at night, I presented him with a bottle\
  \ of London gin in the doorway of his house. He took it expectantly.\n\tI greeted\
  \ the family members one by one \u2013 an old woman in a chair, a middle-aged couple,\
  \ a group of teenagers, half a dozen children. Opa put the gin on the table and\
  \ gave me a beer. The teenagers translated for us. We joked together, and I took\
  \ in the house. \n\tThere was no electricity, no bathroom, no door in the doorway,\
  \ no glass in the windowpane. There were no pictures or books, and only a rug on\
  \ the floor with a dog lying over it. None of it struck me as strange, and none\
  \ of it provoked me to think. Their poverty knew no desperation. I just sat there\
  \ with them and drank.\n\tEverybody shared the beer but only Opa and I drank gin.\
  \ We drank it neat from plastic cups, toasting each other warmly. We drank steadily\
  \ like old friends. Before I left he stood over me and challenged me to hug. I stood,\
  \ we hugged and the dog chased me out of the house. Before I cycled away the teenagers\
  \ explained I was the only white person who\u2019d ever set foot in that house.\
  \ I rode back happy, with the road spinning all around me.\n\n*\n\nThe next day\
  \ I packed my bag. My head ached and my soul was dry. I thirsted for friendship.\
  \ I was surprised that Opa wasn\u2019t around to say goodbye. The Germans were apathetic\
  \ about his absence. They dropped me off in town and drove off quickly. I emailed\
  \ later to thank them. Their reply was a heartbreak. \n\tThey told me that Opa hadn\u2019\
  t shown up to work for three days because he\u2019d been \u2018sick from drink\u2019\
  . They\u2019d been forced to let him go. What they meant was that he\u2019d been\
  \ drinking the gin I\u2019d given him instead of going to work. He\u2019d sat in\
  \ his house, toasting me long after I\u2019d gone, his glass pointing at the empty\
  \ doorway, his responsibilities sinking to the bottom of his cup. They were no other\
  \ farms nearby \u2013 nowhere I could picture him working. I couldn\u2019t picture\
  \ his options at all. What did he say to his family when he sobered up? How had\
  \ his children replied?\n\tI wonder if they hated me. I wonder if they ate.\n\n\
  *\n\nI slumped down in a hostel in Johannesburg, broken and sick with stupidity.\
  \ I thought of the damage I\u2019d caused \u2013 the unseen and irrevocable damage.\
  \ Guilt overran me. And all I could do was drink."
