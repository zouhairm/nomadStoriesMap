Text: "\u2018Pure seduction\u2019 is more than a scent, it\u2019s Cartagena\n \nA\
  \ jewel-like paradise nestled on the Caribbean coast, the city tells the - not so\
  \ fairy - tales of a rich history and complex past. Amid stories of Spanish conquistadors\
  \ and battles for independence, this little gem has managed to cling on to its character\
  \ and preserve its vivacity, notwithstanding a historical struggle for freedom.\
  \ \n\n \nBy C\xE9lia Berlemont\n \nAside from a one-of-a-kind ticket sale and a\
  \ much needed \u2018soak up the sun for Vitamin D\u2019 session, little did I know\
  \ my 10-day trip would be much more than just an Insta-worthy sunny vacation, as\
  \ I booked our flights to the unknown.\n \nMarching to the beat of its own drum,\
  \ colonial buildings and dazzling beaches crown Colombia\u2019s most enchanting\
  \ fortress \u2013 Cartagena. Awash with vibrant colours, the intricate doors of\
  \ the old town invite you to travel in time and embark on a journey that takes you\
  \ back to the 17th century. \n\nDeeply rooted in Latin culture and architecture,\
  \ the old town has a somehow baffling majestic touch that leaves you powerless.\
  \ I can't tell if it's the ability to sense and feel the port city's most intimate\
  \ historical moments or the absolute lunacy of standing on top of a 13-km long stone\
  \ wall that got my head spinning, but there is something about a wall once built\
  \ to block enemies from entering the city by sea that made me instantaneously imagine\
  \ the great stories of the past. Yet, with the temperature currently hovering around\
  \ 36\xB0C, the immediate access to fresh water and local snacks just a few steps\
  \ away from the wall gives some enjoyable benefits to our present era.\n \nIt\u2019\
  s hot, it's quiet and it's magical. Despite the panoramic sea view, I couldn\u2019\
  t escape being swept along by the need to dive in, explore the side streets, drink\
  \ coffee and experience the cultural diversity the city offers. A colourful gem\
  \ both in the literal and metaphorical sense, the abundance of little boutiques\
  \ and green emeralds displayed in the streets\u2019 shop windows create a unique\
  \ atmosphere that merges hospitality and warmth with craft and fineness.\n \nOnce\
  \ outside the walled city, expect to find yourself drawn in by Plaza de La Trinidad\
  \ (Trinidad Square), another gem located in the heart of the up-and-coming neighbourood\
  \ of Getsemani that got me falling hard for its authentic and artistic feel. Not\
  \ only will you enjoy the Caribbean laid-back vibes of this traveller-friendly gathering\
  \ place where locals, families, students and street performers meet up every night\
  \ to grab drinks and eat incredible food, but you\u2019ll also lose track of time\
  \ dancing on the boisterous rhythms of local musicians \u2013 Don\u2019t waste time\
  \ trying to resist those salsa beats!\n \nGroovy on the inside and scenic on the\
  \ outside, the city is hard to leave at first but who can turn down the calling\
  \ of crystalline blue waters, hammocks and ceviches? A shy 40-minute boat ride from\
  \ the old town\u2019s port, Rosario Islands are what azure dreams are made of. In\
  \ budget-friendly resorts or more luxurious villas, say bye-bye to WiFi connection,\
  \ Uber Eats and virtual friends and hello to local villagers, freshly squeezed juices,\
  \ snorkeling and kayaking on the Pacific Ocean."
