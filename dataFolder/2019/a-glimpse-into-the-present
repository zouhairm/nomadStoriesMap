Text: "Sad isn\u2019t an emotion I typically have for long when travelling. I\u2019\
  ve met my fair share of awesome people just to be forced to part the next day, experienced\
  \ horribly unlucky days and seen absolute atrocities of the past, but this was different.\
  \ This was personal, and it has stuck with me to this day.\n \n\tI had decided to\
  \ quit my full-time job in Data Analytics to temporarily teach English in Beijing.\
  \ My reasons ranged from learning more about my culture and the language, to having\
  \ an opportunity to spend time with my extended family, who I haven\u2019t seen\
  \ in 15 years. Sprinkle in a bit of a quarter-life crisis and we have a life-altering\
  \ decision that completely shifted the trajectory of my life. \n\n\tGrowing up in\
  \ Canada for the vast majority of my life, my exposure to Chinese culture was limited\
  \ to my parents and the media. This painted a very limited picture of my entire\
  \ heritage and history, and I yearned to know more. Fast-forward to a few months\
  \ living in the largest city in China, Beijing. By now, I was calling it the same\
  \ thing as Toronto, only with Chinese being spoken, Chinese people and an incredibly\
  \ efficient transportation system. \n\n\tWhat had I learned? China is an amazing\
  \ country in its own right. Most live quite comfortably, basic healthcare is cheap\
  \ and efficient, very wealthy individuals running businesses (albeit many for the\
  \ government) exist and there are even features about it that I dare say are superior\
  \ to North America. The food specifically is ridiculously cheap and prepared in\
  \ literally minutes. China has come a long way since its earlier days and English\
  \ is now almost a status symbol in the country, so its prominence is improving rapidly\
  \ especially within the more developed cities. \n\n\tWith the 4 month semester I\
  \ had teaching at AIDI International School, one of the best education establishments\
  \ in Beijing, I had the chance to meet locals, other temporary teachers like myself,\
  \ and a number of international people who had decided to call China home. I am\
  \ quite thankful that I had managed to at least pickup some limited Chinese in my\
  \ parents\u2019 household. That generally allowed me to communicate in most social\
  \ scenarios unlike some of my other teaching counterparts.\n\n\tOne specific individual\
  \ who left a mark on me was a librarian at our school. We had chatted a few times\
  \ because I had gone to the library often in-between classes, since Wi-Fi was not\
  \ available in the Elementary school I taught in. Eventually she had agreed to grab\
  \ coffee with me and for context, my teaching contract was up in a month or so and\
  \ I was honest about that fact. The way I saw it, I enjoyed her company and I wanted\
  \ the opportunity to learn more about life as a local. Practicing my Chinese didn\u2019\
  t hurt either.\n\n\tConversation started pretty normally, discussing hobbies, past\
  \ experiences and future plans. However, as we talked more, things became more personal.\
  \ Towards the shop\u2019s closing time, she had told me about a letter she\u2019\
  d written to me, but was scared to show me. \n\n\tIt consisted of a description\
  \ of her history, from dealing with a difficult family, to studying hard to get\
  \ into a good school and finally landing the job she had at the school now, which\
  \ was decent but largely mediocre in the grand scheme. The worst part about hearing\
  \ all this was that there really was no plausible fix. Going back to school is unheard\
  \ of in China, along with most thoughts of entrepreneurship unless in an already\
  \ privileged household and for large parts of the population, education is the only\
  \ way to escape their parents\u2019 way of life. Once establishing a career, working\
  \ hours are long, vacation time is short, expectations are sky high and even after\
  \ all this, governmental restrictions on travel apply. \n\n\tTreasure the freedom\
  \ you have in your home country. Its importance is often neglected until we are\
  \ told that we cannot do something we want. We may not be able to carve out our\
  \ future\u2019s entirely but we have a significant role to play and that is not\
  \ a right given to all."
