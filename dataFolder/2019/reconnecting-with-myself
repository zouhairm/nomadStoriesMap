Text: "Same place, new approach. That was my intention when I went to Hong Kong last\
  \ March.  I always travel to Hong Kong at least once a year, and I always go to\
  \ the same place and do the same thing. This time around, I made the choice of approaching\
  \ this trip with a child-like attitude, full of curiosity and playfulness. I started\
  \ where I feel most comfortable with, the food. I always eat at the same restaurant,\
  \ at the same location, and always reserve beforehand. But I wanted to try something\
  \ new. I  roamed around the corners of the familiar streets, and I was rewarded\
  \ with restaurants that I never knew existed! I tried different food. I had to the\
  \ courage to start conversations with the locals and learned to smile more. \n\n\
  My activities were more spontaneous. I rode their local tram and just decided to\
  \ get off at a local park. It was a nice change of scenery from the usual busy city\
  \ and the malls. I felt the cold air's breeze, the smell of the trees, the fresh\
  \ air, and the peace and serenity that the park gave. As I sat there on the park's\
  \ bench, I closed my eyes and turned to gratitude. I was grateful for the opportunity\
  \ to enjoy the day's nice weather. I was grateful that for the whole trip, everything\
  \ went smoothly. I was grateful that I was able to spend time with nature and re-connect\
  \ with myself again.\n\nMost importantly, I was grateful that I was just being myself\
  \ during the whole trip. I learned a lot about myself, about what I really want\
  \ in life and how much I love life despite the uncertainty that it can bring."
