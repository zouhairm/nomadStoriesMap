Text: "A brief stay at a hostel I happened to meet a fellow globetrotter in Basel\
  \ Switzerland who after sharing our past and present travel destinations suggested\
  \ visiting Barcelona \u2013 Spain in my next bucket list. Basel was especially interesting\
  \ being at the centre of the Rhine River where one side is France, the other Switzerland\
  \ then the other Germany.\nTo cut the long story short and already armed with my\
  \ Schengen visa and an invitation by a friend to spend Christmas 2015 in Tarbes-\
  \ France then New Year in Barcelona 2016, I planned to spend a few days in this\
  \ relatively unknown country \u2018Andorra\u2019 sandwiched between France and Spain\
  \ which is famous for Skiing.\nAndorra a principality from hear- say and first-hand\
  \ experience is famous for skiing and discounts in shops whereby travellers from\
  \ neighbouring countries and world at large visit. I must say the bus journey from\
  \ Toulouse to Andorra City was exciting being a solo traveller and enthusiast at\
  \ the same time. I quickly found out that speaking English was essential in asking\
  \ for directions however, I quickly learnt that the commute to the city centre was\
  \ not very complicated as well as finding find your way especially being spontaneous\
  \ and finding your way by getting lost through exploring unknown territories.\n\
  There was obviously the feeling of a little bit different however; the warmness\
  \ and welcoming nature of the people I interacted with helped to make me feel at\
  \ home. I remember staying at a hotel was  a bit of a disadvantage to hostels which\
  \ I was able to make friends quickly however passing time at the shopping malls\
  \ and purchasing stuff at affordable prices for family and close friends was indeed\
  \ something that I was able to verify. I remember hoping on to a bus that drove\
  \ through some very breathtaking ski slopes and as usual, I dropped off at a local\
  \ antique shop where I bought a fridge magnet which is/was my rule for travelling\
  \ as a souvenir.\nFinally taking the bus to Barcelona at the end of the trip brought\
  \ both sadness and happiness as I had gotten attached and wanted to stay more bit\
  \ then again there was the excitement of visiting Barcelona with first hand eye\
  \ to eye view of the famous Camp Nou stadium. I remember thinking probably I could\
  \ have spent a few days in Monaco!!!."
