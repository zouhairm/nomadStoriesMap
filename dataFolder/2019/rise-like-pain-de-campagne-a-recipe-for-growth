Text: "(1) Portion 500 grams of whole-wheat flour from the canvas sack slumped in\
  \ the pantry. Pretend not to hear your hosts in the next room. \n\n\u201CElle ne\
  \ parle pas fran\xE7ais,\u201D LN will announce to Michel, nodding her head toward\
  \ the kitchen.\n\n\u201CHmm?\u201D Michel will question from behind an unfolded\
  \ newspaper. He won\u2019t misunderstand her statement; the purpose of his inquiry\
  \ merely a show of indignation.\n\n\u201CLa fille,\u201D LN will respond slowly,\
  \ pausing as if Michel himself does not speak French, \u201Cne parle... pas... le\
  \ fran\xE7ais.\u201D\n\nMichel\u2019s face will languidly surface from his reading\
  \ before disappearing back behind the news. He will sigh, \u201CAh, oui. Elle ne\
  \ parle pas fran\xE7ais.\u201D\n\n\n(2) Combine flour, a teaspoon of salt, and a\
  \ sachet of yeast to a bowl. Run a fork through the blend. \n\nIt will be your first\
  \ solo trip abroad. You\u2019ve signed up to volunteer as a farmhand in La Brousse,\
  \ a small commune in western France. You aren\u2019t a farmer. You don\u2019t speak\
  \ French. \n\n\n(3) Add 31.5 cl of lukewarm water from the squeaky tap. Mix your\
  \ ingredients. \n\nLN will show you your quarters. Try to memorize the path: out\
  \ the door, behind the ceramics atelier, past the vegetable garden, over the creek,\
  \ through a hedge of field elm. You will immediately spot the 1976 caravan, half\
  \ sunk into the landscape. \n\n(4) Knead your dough for 5 minutes. Repeatedly push\
  \ your knuckles to the cracked wood surface and pull your hands back toward your\
  \ apron. \n\nOn your first day of work, you will be instructed to pull the poppies.\
  \ Take a moment to admire them-- tangerine, carmine, canary, all bobbing in the\
  \ breeze-- but don\u2019t pause for long. \n\nLN will scold, \u201Cthese are poison\
  \ in my garden.\u201D\n\nYou will be sad, carrying handfuls of them by their roots,\
  \ their heads hanging like multi-colored frowns. \n\n(5) With a dull paring knife,\
  \ pit and chop two handfuls of olives\u2014three, if your hands are small.\n\nBy\
  \ day three, you should recognize the difference between poison and sustenance.\
  \ Understand that sometimes one grows up the other. Learn to delicately separate\
  \ the two, adding only the latter to dinner. \n\nBy day five, you\u2019ll know the\
  \ sting of nettles, honeybees, and bramble thorns. Learn where the dock leaf grows,\
  \ where the baking soda sits on the shelf, and where to hide the last pair of gardening\
  \ gloves. \n\n(6) Cover your dough with a damp cloth and let it rest in a glass\
  \ dish.\n\nBegin to accept solitude. Sneak into the kitchen in the early morning,\
  \ with only the sleeping wolfhound for company. Sit at the long farm table with\
  \ your knees to your chest and an open dictionary in front of you. Spread \u201C\
  le beurre\u201D on \u201Cle pain\u201D and wash it down with \u201Cth\xE9 vert.\u201D\
  \n\nFamiliarize yourself with this solitude. Sometimes you will find it along the\
  \ road back from town, as you walk your bicycle with the flat tire past deer grazing\
  \ in sunburnt grasses, chalky prehistoric caves, and fields full of slowly pirouetting\
  \ sunflowers.\n\nListen for it in the cicadas, the nightjar, or the grumble of a\
  \ passing old Renault over the pebbled road. \n\n(7) Punch down your risen dough\
  \ and knead in the olives. Roll the dough into a ball on a tray. Allow it to rise\
  \ for another 30 minutes.\n\nOn day ten, it will be La F\xEAte de la Musique. Follow\
  \ your hosts into town, with a basket of bread to share. The potluck dinner will\
  \ be outside of a church-turned-concert hall, on tables stitched together by mismatch\
  \ tablecloths. Drink wine. Try Berger basque, piperade, and several forms of ham.\
  \ \n\nBy twilight, the band will have moved out onto the street with their accordions\
  \ and guitars. Townspeople will crowd together, singing folk songs-- the kind that\
  \ even the children know, but you do not. Allow yourself to be pulled into the flock,\
  \ despite not knowing the words. Wonder if all 499 residents of La Brousse are there,\
  \ on that street, in that moment. \n\n8: Bake your bread at 240C for 15 minutes,\
  \ and for 15 minutes more at 180C. Bring your bread to the table.\n\nAsk for the\
  \ butter entirely in French. Hide a smile behind a forkful of dandelion salad."
