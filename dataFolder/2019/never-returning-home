Text: "I am a third culture kid. Not a bad thing isn't it? That's what I thought as\
  \ well, until once a fellow traveler asked me about my nationality and with pride\
  \ I blurted out \"Indian\"! Then she asked more about India and I was at a loss\
  \ of words, rather information. So in my defense, I revealed some more details about\
  \ me. Born and raised in Saudi Arabia and currently settled in Qatar! Although she\
  \ was excited to hear that, she asked me one big question \"why did you then say\
  \ you are an Indian\". 'That's how that side of the world is. It doesn't matter\
  \ if you were born there or how long you've lived there. I function on an Indian\
  \ passport, I guess that makes me an Indian. ' I said with a smile. \n\nIt was a\
  \ simple question, but it rang many bells in my head, it took me back in time. A\
  \ time where I didn't mind covering up with an ab-ayah (black cloak), or the times\
  \ that I didn't think much about being accompanied by a male family member, to most\
  \ public places or not having a church to go to. When you haven't really seen the\
  \ world, you tend to think this is how life is. I've also lived in India for a substantial\
  \ amount of time, but again I was accompanied by elders for safety reasons and of\
  \ course there was an unsaid curfew (6 pm) for us girls. I have to add college was\
  \ different though. After college I went back to Saudi Arabia and landed myself\
  \ a job. One of the first things i did was 'book a ticket'! People who know me now\
  \ wouldn't be surprised, but it all started from there. \n\nThe more I saw this\
  \ beautiful world, the more I realized how much I longed for independence. The sort\
  \ of independence that my family gave me, but the laws didn't. Soon I made my decision\
  \ to move out but here comes the tricky part. If I were to move, I would  get an\
  \ exit stamp on my passport (back then, Saudi Arabia was one of the countries that\
  \ did not issue visit visa's). It simply meant- there was no coming back. I stuck\
  \ to my decision and knew I needed to take this leap into the unknown for myself.\
  \ No more would I have to depend on my Dad or brother if I wanted to go to the grocery\
  \ store or anywhere insignificant. Without a second thought, I grabbed the first\
  \ job opportunity. \n\nBoarding that final flight was one of the toughest things\
  \ I had to do. The whole time, I had a lump in my throat. Imagine never getting\
  \ to return to the country you were born in, a country you spend most of your life\
  \ in. Imagine never getting to see the places that are dear to you. Imagine never\
  \ returning to a country that is in all sense your 'home', yet you never get to\
  \ claim it like that. Luckily, I found condolence in the fact that i was just moving\
  \ to the neighboring country and it even shared land borders. But a year later,\
  \ during the holy month of Ramadan Saudi Arabia, U.A.E. and Bahrain proclaimed a\
  \ ban on Qatar, cutting off all economic and social ties. Many families who had\
  \ cross country marriages had to helplessly subject to this big blow. Everybody\
  \ has now moved on and found ways to work around this situation. But it is always\
  \ a painful memory. There are times me and my husband go to the border (which is\
  \ now closed), for a long drive, and I find myself tearing up. And the times when\
  \ my husband who is born and raised in Qatar shows me his old neighborhood, schools\
  \ he went to, parks he played in, I cant help but reminisce my homeland with nothing\
  \ but fond memories. But wait, am I allowed to call it my homeland? \nLittle did\
  \ I know this is how I would feel years after I took that leap into the unknown.\n\
