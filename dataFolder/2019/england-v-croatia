Text: "The World Cup was taking place, and all of China knew it. No matter what city\
  \ I was in at the time some bar would be playing the game. I did not watch all the\
  \ games in the beginning, but I loved the hype of it. A few nights we all went to\
  \ a bar either downtown or near to us, to watch the game. Everyone inside would\
  \ watch intensely and we would have light conversation and cheer when something\
  \ happened. Then Croatia advanced, and my interest spiked. Being half Croatian,\
  \ and having spent almost all my childhood summers there I was proud of the new\
  \ name recognition. Each time Croatia played they had a 2 am game, yet I stayed\
  \ up and watched from the comfort of my apartment. Each time they won, was a small\
  \ victory for me, alone when everyone else was sleeping. \n\nAbout halfway through\
  \ the summer, a group of students from the UK came to stay near our apartments.\
  \ One of them interned with me, and we constantly bantered about the possibly of\
  \ England v. Croatia. Then it actually happened, again another 2 am game. At around\
  \ 1:40 am I went to the bar near our apartments that we always went to. All the\
  \ English students were there already, drinking, smoking, screaming out \n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s coming home!!!\u201D\n\nEveryone was in good spirits, laughing at me because\
  \ I thought Croatia would win. I sat near the TV watching intensely, the herd of\
  \ Brits standing behind me. Five minutes into the game England scored, and everyone\
  \ cheered. The guys began tackling each other, falling to the ground, jumping, shouting,\
  \ cheering, and I couldn\u2019t help but smile alongside, despite being down by\
  \ one. The next hour of the game was my favorite part. Everyone was singing songs\
  \ for England. Various chants about the players, insert some British slang, and\
  \ the happiest grins you\u2019ve ever seen. Each time one chant would end, one guy\
  \ would start another and everyone would join in without hesitation. Part of me\
  \ really wanted to join in, but I had to hold strong for my country. A few of them\
  \ would come to me, and again tell me\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s coming home!\u201D \n\n\
  Sixty-eight minutes in and Croatia scored. I cheered, again alone, everyone else\
  \ slightly on edge now with the score being tied. The game went into overtime and\
  \ everyone went out for a smoke. It was around 4 AM. I was exhausted, but then Croatia\
  \ won. I couldn\u2019t stop smiling, grinning ear to ear, however, the room around\
  \ me was silent. Not just a quiet silent, but a devastated silent. I quickly left\
  \ the room and ran home with the sun rising.\n\nThe next day I was on a constant\
  \ high from Croatia\u2019s victory yet, in my head all I could think was\n\n\u201C\
  Ohhhh Harry Kane you are the love of my life\u2026oh Harry Kane I\u2019d let you\
  \ shag my wife\u2026\u201D\n\nFor days, those songs were on a constant repeat in\
  \ my head. Honestly, they still are. In the end, they all cheered for Croatia despite\
  \ being beat. Various reasons were given\n\n\u201CWe just hate the French.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CIf they\u2019re going to beat us they might as well win.\u201D\n\nIn a\
  \ way, I wish England had advanced so I could have a repeat of that night. How they\
  \ cheered and sang and drank all night long, not just when England scored, but the\
  \ entirety of the game. It was intoxicating, their energy.  I was introduced to\
  \ English culture that night and fell in love with it, the last thing I expected\
  \ from my time abroad in China."
