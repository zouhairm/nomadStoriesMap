Text: "Bob Marley bumped through the speaker in my lap as we rumbled down a dirt road\
  \ towards Sigiriya. We\u2019d just escaped the chaos of downtown Colombo and were\
  \ headed in-land for a few days of history. Palm trees swayed and water buffalo\
  \ grazed on each side of the road, as the 30-degree breeze tangled my hair into\
  \ a tumbleweed. I leaned forward, threw my arms around Matt\u2019s neck and said,\
  \ \u201CThis is the best thing we\u2019ve ever done.\u201D\n\nIn the rearview, I\
  \ could see his smile \u2014 an ear-to-ear grin that matched my own. We were just\
  \ two days in to a month of roadtripping across Sri Lanka and we already never wanted\
  \ to leave.\n\nThree months earlier, we got married along a river outside our hometown\
  \ of Vancouver, Canada. For our honeymoon, we knew we wanted a combination of relaxing\
  \ on the beach, yoga (for me) and surfing (for him). Bali was the natural choice\
  \ (we\u2019ve spent several months there over the years), so that became stop one\
  \ for our honeymoon adventure. But we also wanted to experience a new culture we\u2019\
  d never seen before.\n\nSri Lanka had never really been on my radar. But when my\
  \ husband floated the idea and I started researching, I fell into a vortex of untouched\
  \ beaches, bottomless curry and rich history dating back to the fifth century. I\
  \ was hooked \u2014 Sri Lanka would be stop two.\n\nWe\u2019re not typical travellers\
  \ who plan the whole trip ahead of time. We\u2019d rather show up in a new place,\
  \ hop on a motorbike and figure it out as we go. We go away for months at a time\
  \ with nothing but a single duffle bag between us.\n\nThat said, we wanted to have\
  \ some idea of what to expect when we arrived. We figured it would be similar to\
  \ other Southeast Asian countries we've visited where you can rent a scooter and\
  \ drive yourself around at will. Turns out, that\u2019s not really the case in Sri\
  \ Lanka \u2014 tourists hardly ever trek the country on two wheels. But the thought\
  \ of being at the mercy of train and bus schedules didn\u2019t sit well with our\
  \ spontaneous travel spirit.\n\nThat\u2019s when we discovered the ideal mode of\
  \ transportation: a tuktuk.\n\nA tuktuk (or an auto rickshaw) is a small, three-wheeled\
  \ vehicle commonly used across the world as urban transport. In developing countries,\
  \ \u201Ctuktuk\u201D is almost synonymous with \u201Ctaxi\u201D: whether you\u2019\
  re in Thailand or El Salvador, you can\u2019t walk down the street without getting\
  \ a handful of ride offers from local drivers. They\u2019re rickety, cheap and not\
  \ exactly safe \u2014 but we knew a tuktuk was perfect for us.\n\nTo our pleasant\
  \ surprise, you can easily rent one in Sri Lanka. There are several companies that\
  \ match tourists with local tuktuk owners to make sure each rental contributes to\
  \ the local economy. Depending on the company, they\u2019ll even organize your local\
  \ driver\u2019s license (which is required in Sri Lanka) and insurance. If your\
  \ vehicle needs any repairs during your rental, that\u2019s all covered, too.\n\n\
  Renting a tuktuk opened us up to see parts of the country a typical traveller would\
  \ never see. We got lost offroading through rice fields and asked for directions\
  \ from local farmers. We hunted down waterfalls for fresh-water swims when the humidity\
  \ became a little too much. We paid a mango toll to a friendly elephant on the highway\
  \ through Udawalawe National Park. We backtracked by seven hours to hike Adam\u2019\
  s Peak at 2am to witness the first visible sunrise in over a week. We burned incense\
  \ at midnight in a moonlit Buddhist monastery, all because we saw a light at the\
  \ top of a hill and decided to explore.\n\nIn 30 days, we drove over 2,000 kilometres\
  \ in our little tuktuk. That three-wheeler felt more like home than any of the homestays\
  \ or bungalows we\u2019d stayed at in two months abroad. Without our own transportation,\
  \ we wouldn\u2019t have had off-the-beaten-track experiences that made our trip\
  \ unforgettable.\n\nWhen we first decided to rent a tuktuk, I thought it would be\
  \ a cool way to travel. Now that I\u2019ve done it, it\u2019s clear there's no better\
  \ way to experience this incredible country than on three wheels."
