Text: "Scotland, rich in culture, history, raw and wild nature, whiskey and a constant\
  \ drizzle of rain.\n\nI new it was a place I had to experience in my life time,\
  \ the only issue holding me back was, I had no one who wanted to come and explore\
  \ it with me. So I decided to go it alone.\n\nI had secured a live-in position in\
  \ a hotel on the Isle of Mull, in a settlement called Craignure with a population\
  \ of about 200 people. The isolation did not frighten me, much, but the anticipation\
  \ of being in a country, on the other side of the world, without knowing a single\
  \ soul, scared the living day lights out of me. \nBare in mind that before my move\
  \ to the UK I would not have been seen dead on a lone coffee date, let alone moving\
  \ to a foreign country, alone.\n\nI awoke on an old black leather couch in my friends\
  \ living room, with the familiar fog of a big night out. I seedily sat up and placed\
  \ my feet to the floor, sugar and crisps, crunched beneath my feet, mixed with the\
  \ sticky residue of some suspicious substance. Sleep deprived and hungover from\
  \ the two day bender of Brighton\u2019s, Wildlife Festival. \nI dragged my butt\
  \ up, pushing to the back of my mind the anxiety and vomit worthy fear that was\
  \ sneaking in with the realization that today was the day that I was flying to Scotland.\n\
  \nAs we strolled back to my friends apartment after breakfast, I absorbed my surrounding\u2019\
  s with awe. \nBeautiful old buildings of brick and stone, how did I get here, on\
  \ the other side of the world. I could still pinch myself with amazement, a small\
  \ town girl, from New Zealand becoming a woman of the world.\n\nOn arrival to Glasgow,\
  \ the driver who drove me to my hotel asked what my business was in Glasgow. I told\
  \ him of my venture to Mull his response was classic \u201CYou must not like people\
  \ very much then do ya?\u201D, I laughed and honestly thought \u201CWhat am I doing\
  \ here!\u201D.\n \nThe following day, at the crack of dawn, I was up to catch my\
  \ train to the coastal town of Oban. \nI had packed plenty of books for the 4 hour\
  \ ride, how naive I was. \nThe views I experienced on that train ride were some\
  \ of the most majestic and heart opening scenery I had ever seen, no books were\
  \ needed. With lochs galore, rolling mountains, quaint Scottish settlements, the\
  \ most lush looking greenery you could imagine, and a spontaneous Castle Ruin every\
  \ now and then. I was entertained by the very essence of this magical country. Every\
  \ corner we turned held a magical surprise.\n\nA 45 minute ferry crossing from Oban\
  \ took me to my destination.\nI arrived, gazing around at the TINY settlement of\
  \ Craignure, which consisted of a caf\xE9, a small dairy, a tiny Scottish pub, a\
  \ backpackers and an op-shop, all of which I could see from my viewpoint on the\
  \ warf. \nI stood thinking a mix of, \u201CWhat the heck am I doing here, alone?!\u201D\
  \ and \u201CI am so fricken blessed to be here.\u201D\n\nI was completely ALONE,\
  \ on an island, in a foreign country that I new of no one. This was to be a huge\
  \ lesson for me on nurturing myself, being proactive about my health and wellbeing,\
  \ becoming my own bestie and finding strength in the fearful moments. \nLife is\
  \ short, so babes, feel the fear and do it anyway.\n\nThe reality of travelling\
  \ alone is that it does have a huge amount of challenging moments, (I mean even\
  \ carting all your luggage alone can be a friggen nightmare). You will be pushed\
  \ to your absolute limit of surrender, acceptance and assertiveness, but there is\
  \ a beauty in lone adventures that could not be found in any other way. The sense\
  \ of empowerment, the experiences of kindness and support from absolute strangers\
  \ and travelers just like me and the excitement and deep gratitude from experiencing\
  \ the diverse beauty of the world we live in are experiences I will never forget\
  \ or tire from. \n\nWould I travel alone again? Abso-friggen-lutely."
