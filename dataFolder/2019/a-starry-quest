Text: "Resting with her back to the views, she watched us until her eyes gave, occasionally\
  \ reopening with a rumbling growl for any potential threats lurking in the dim light.\
  \ Illuminated minarets that pierced the sky were accompanied by the waxing crescent\
  \ moon, creating a picturesque nightlight in the heart of the enigma that was \xC7\
  i\xE7i\u2019s stomping ground: Sultanahmet, the Old City of Istanbul.\n\nIstanbul\
  \ was the final stop before my long flight home. Captivated and overcome with curiosity,\
  \ I was determined to spend my overnight layover engulfed in its mystery. As to\
  \ how exactly I was going to accomplish this in the night of an unfamiliar country\
  \ as a solo female was my great obstacle. \n\nClosing hour approached as nearby\
  \ mosques took turns echoing their last prayers into the evening. I knew I didn\u2019\
  t have much time left to find locals that could help me figure out what my potential\
  \ range for the night was, so I sat at the first restaurant I came upon in hopes\
  \ to get some information from the workers.\n\nAfter a couple of hours of bonding\
  \ with the staff that led to a round of rak\u0131, I earned myself an impromptu\
  \ walking tour of the area by the kind owner, Mehmet.\n\nThat\u2019s when we met\
  \ our third. She happened to stroll by just as we stepped out onto the street. When\
  \ I inquired for her owner, Mehmet shrugged, \u201CShe\u2019s ours, I guess, the\
  \ neighborhood\u2019s -- \xC7i\xE7i.\u201D (Pronounced Chi-Chi)\n \n\xC7i\xE7i,\
  \ a Turkish term of endearment; and the loveliest stray mutt she was. As luck would\
  \ have it, I found myself with two local guides who would end up accompanying me\
  \ until the sunrise.\n\n\xC7i\xE7i raced us down cobble steps as we began our starry\
  \ journey. It was 3am. At this quiet hour, with only the sounds of the faithful\u2019\
  s awakening prayers, one could have an intimate conversation with the streets. We\
  \ wandered and weaved through the historic quarters, sometimes following Mehmet,\
  \ other times trailing the pitter patter of our furry friend who knew the old city\
  \ like the back of her paw. We sat at Europe\u2019s edge on the waterfront that\
  \ looked out across the narrow channel which divided the city; the other half uniquely\
  \ occupying the Asian continent. Suppressing incoming aches created by my reluctance\
  \ to leave, I envisioned a day I\u2019d return to take it all in. \n\nWhen darkness\
  \ began to lift, we set out on our pilgrimage to the grand finale. \xC7i\xE7i\u2019\
  s gait loosened as she left my side, prancing straight towards the iconic monument\
  \ ahead: the Blue Mosque.\n\nLike a gracious host, she led the way underneath a\
  \ modest arch and into the solemn courtyard. Her dirtied, off-white coat blended\
  \ in with the neutral palette of white marble and stone. Mehmet left me to my solitude\
  \ as I humbly explored all the facets of the treasured jewel of Istanbul. Breaking\
  \ the hypnosis of Turkish architecture was \xC7i\xE7i, rolling around as she tried\
  \ to satiate an itch on the uneven stone floor. \n\nAt 6am, the prospect of trying\
  \ traditionally prepared coffee led us out into the park where we were lured in\
  \ by the aroma of a nearby street vendor. A Turkish elder had already beaten us.\
  \ He sat patiently, observing the foreign girl and her lone city wolf, while a culinary\
  \ alchemist tended to the charcoal, adjusting them accordingly around copper cups.\
  \ The smell soothed our minds as we gazed reverently at Hagia Sophia slowly emerging\
  \ in the light. \n\nIn the stillness of the morning fog, we all seemed to have gotten\
  \ lost in contemplation. Sensing our quest was complete, \xC7i\xE7i laid at my feet\
  \ and quickly surrendered to a deep, twitching sleep. I gratefully smiled to myself,\
  \ then to Mehmet, and lastly to our canine companion. Together at the crossroads\
  \ of Europe and Asia, we shared the final magical chapter of my journey."
