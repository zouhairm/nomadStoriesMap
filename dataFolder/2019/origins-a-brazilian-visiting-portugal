Text: "I have always been passionate about hearing the stories of families and their\
  \ origins. Immigrants, Refugees, Adventurers and all the encounters and disagreements\
  \ that may exist leave me intrigued! I realize that every little story is part of\
  \ a great story that transforms a place into a city and a people into a culture.\
  \ I'm Brazilian and I really like to travel. Yes, I can say that I know my country.\
  \ OK ... a country the size of Brazil would deserve a life to be really known, but\
  \ I can say that I've been to many places!\n\nIn this context, I am the classic\
  \ case of the Brazilian great-grandson of Portuguese. So, I decided to discover\
  \ the origin of my family in the old continent: PORTUGAL! The new year eave in the\
  \ city of Porto and some of the cities in the coast until arriving in Lisbon? That\
  \ would be great! So I rented a car and listed some places to eat and sleep. I would\
  \ resume it: It was incredible! ... In planning, I thought everything would be in\
  \ a very classic and traditional way: \"EUROPE\", but in fact, it was very similar\
  \ to Brazil! It was as if it were turned back in time ... I confess that I imagined\
  \ that the countries that were once a colony maintained many customs and traditions\
  \ of the colonizing country, but in my case, went beyond. It was like looking back\
  \ in time! It worked like that The city of Porto made me go back to Rio de Janeiro!\
  \ Lisbon made me arrive in Santos by a path never imagined, after all, an ocean\
  \ physically separated us, but every detail in the \"Pra\xE7a do Com\xE9rcio\",\
  \ and the \"Avenida dos Aliados\", made me see the similarities.\n\nA more restrained\
  \ people, (a difference perhaps by temperature). While in Rio it was 40\xBAC in\
  \ an intense summer, Portugal demanded a heavy jacket for me to walk in the streets...\
  \ but there was something behind the architecture. Something similar in the air\
  \ made me forget I was traveling! The scent of chestnuts, typical of Portuguese\
  \ winter, was different from the popcorn on the sidewalk ... what was it then?\n\
  \nOver time I understood the words better, I was feeling embraced by the environment.\
  \ That was it ... The Brazilian recognition of being a welcoming people had its\
  \ origin! Portugal is made of people who make you feel at home ... no frills, natural!\
  \ A Brazilian way of being that justified all the confusion and similarity of the\
  \ trams, the cafes ... In a metaforic way, I was in the country that was the father\
  \ of Brazil!\n\nAs a tourist, I could not fail to get to know Fado music, Portugal's\
  \ cultural heritage! I noticed in the traditional melodies the cry of the Portuguese\
  \ woman who suffers for her overwhelming love, but I also noticed the Moorish influence,\
  \ \"remember Arabic music, no?\". Maybe the same story of samba with African music\
  \ ... a mix of who was coming and ended up staying!\n\nAt the end of the trip, it\
  \ was already 2019 and I had to go back to my routine, my house, my job .. but I\
  \ would come back with a tight heart, it was like leaving a dear relative behind.\n\
  \nI met Portugal, I discovered in the country that I discovered Brazil where my\
  \ customs came from. I recommend it! Not only Portugal, but I recommend to all good\
  \ travelers to know its origin, to unveil the manias, the flavors, the colors and\
  \ sounds that have always accompanied you. I left Portugal, but Portugal accompanies\
  \ me every day since them."
