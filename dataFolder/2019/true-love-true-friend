  a girl named Melissa woke up and found everything different or actually she felt
  everything is different after she woke up her best friend Claire came and they had
  a fight actually Melissa started the fight cause she was angry with her she wanted
  to cut all the strings between them she never felt that she was her true friend
  she judge an she never understands the true meaning of what she says and she always
  look at her from a point of view that makes you vomit so Claire left and Melissa
  backed her bag and took her passport and took a day off from her work and went to
  the airport i bet that everyone is asking where did she go but hold on a little
  she flashback to Melissa's apartment window there is her neighbor Nadine, Nadine
  said hey Melissa you seem terrible today is everything okay? Melissa answered frightened
  yes i am fine. why frightened because Nadine is a girl that scares melissa she dance
  everynight she drinks she passout she is on drugs and Melissa didn't like this reckless
  life so back on the way to the airport she booked a ticket to Florence where she
  always wanted to visit this city ,she visited every inch in this city the river
  the buildings the cathedral it was amazing especially when she watched Medici masters
  of Florence and new that cosimo de medici(richard madden) was the one who build
  it in this TV show she went through all the stuff she talked to many people and
  went to Santa Croce, Florence and saw the architecture there she was fascinated
  by it then she met a boy named Lorenzo he was a tour guide he told her you cant
  come to Italy and not visit Venice so he took her to Venice where she went to the
  hotel where Angelina Joli and johnny Depp filmed their movie there (the tourist)
  she even told the guard that she was a journalist and wanted to go up to the room
  that was in the movie and take pictures and the manger in this hotel agreed so it
  was fun , crazy but it was fun and then she thanked Lorenzo and she  said i came
  here to find true friends and i made a friend not true friend but i did make a friend
  this Lorenzo was kind because he got his job back as a tour guide so he wanted to
  do something nice and for free so when he saw Melissa wondering in Florence alone
  he wanted to accompany her to make her happy. she took a plane back home and when
  she arrived on here street she saw Claire crying and saying leave me i did everything
  for you till i was not me anymore just go then her boyfriend left and she threw
  away his things and went upstairs Melissa felt terrible so she went to Clair's apartment
  and knocked and Claire opened and when she saw Melissa, Melissa said hi are you
  ok? do need any thing? she said i am fine but thank you i need help to get rid of
  my ex's stuff do you mind helping me of course not. Melissa saw Claire throwing
  alcohol and drugs away and the sound system so Melissa asked are these his things
  not yours?? Claire said yes those are not mine he made me live with all this filthy
  things everyday he drink and do drugs and i loved him but i cant live like this
  anymore. Melissa said you did the right thing you deserve much better, then they
  took a break Melissa said i was scared of you cause i though you were alcoholic
  Claire laughed and said i know i always wanted for us to be friends as we both try
  to fit in places that doesn't fit us we are the same you know Melissa said i know

  into the unknown so Melissa won.
