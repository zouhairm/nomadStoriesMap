Text: "Travelling has beeline of  my interests eversince I was born. But that was\
  \ not a case with my family. If we travelled then it was going to the village and\
  \ that was once in a while. The time I lost both parents I knew money will be a\
  \ scare resource and such that trips to the village were to be cut. That was true.\
  \ There could be no holiday trips to the village except when visiting for funerals.\
  \ As I was growing had lid myself never to give up. \nIt was in 2008 when I saw\
  \ a television advert for Imagine Afrika, a reality show calling for participants\
  \ to apply. I did the application and in no time I was selected along side two young\
  \ men to represent Malawi in Zambia. This was like a dream to. I was full of imaginations\
  \ of how Zambia looks like. The day I was supposed to travel was here in no time.\
  \ I started off by bus from Malawi's capital city Lilongwe to Zambia's capital city\
  \ of Lusaka. While on wheels I was so amazed seeing the Zambia's natural resources,\
  \ like the famous Luwangwa River.  This was a longest journey I have ever made outside\
  \ the country. Upon reaching the city,I found some similarities with my country\
  \ but somewhat different. It was quite such an amazing experience in my life. Although\
  \ it was a short period of stay in Zambia, I noted that we have alot of cultural\
  \ similarities and that aspect had always make me to mix with different people across\
  \ worldwide.\nOn a greater note, I praised myself for not struggling with their\
  \ currency that much. I have seen in my country Malawi, visitors from all corners\
  \ of the world struggle to understand the currency. But not all to say so. \n10\
  \ years down the line, I still have the memories of passing through a longest bridge\
  \ in my life, on the Luwangwa River. Sometimes I could think like I had just traveled\
  \ yesterday. The application was some kind of a blessing in disguise as the trip\
  \ to Zambia made me to face the reality hence wash off the imaginations I had."
