Text: "In Australia, it\u2019s customary to flash your lights at a car travelling\
  \ in the opposite direction to warn them there are police ahead. They might do the\
  \ same in Sri Lanka, if only the police officers were real. \n\nIt\u2019s our local\
  \ driver, Roshan, with his shock of dark, curly hair and frequent admissions that\
  \ he used to be fat, who explains these lookalikes to us. He tells us that local\
  \ police have set up cardboard cut-outs, complete with faux speed guns, to mimic\
  \ genuine officers and discourage speeding.\n\nThis is only our second day in Sri\
  \ Lanka and it quickly becomes apparent that we will learn more in a few days with\
  \ Roshan, than if we were to spend months here on our own.\n\nIt\u2019s Roshan who\
  \ describes the distinctive Sri Lankan head waggle to us, where a shake of the head\
  \ or, more accurately, a figure of eight, means yes. A more emphatic waggle; \u201C\
  I understand.\u201D\n\nI try to copy him but with little success.\n\nIt\u2019s Roshan\
  \ who points out the ubiquitous \u201Cfree\u201D cows which line every street and\
  \ cross without warning. My mum and I attempt to keep a running tally but we lose\
  \ count on day two at 47.\n\nIt\u2019s Roshan who explains the scarecrows we see\
  \ in front of housing construction sites, designed to catch the attention of passers-by\
  \ who may covet their neighbour\u2019s wealth. \n\nHe tells us this is just one\
  \ of a thousand superstitions in a country where former President, Mahinda Rajapaksa,\
  \ regularly consulted his personal astrologer.\n\nIt\u2019s Roshan who tells us\
  \ about the constant stream of visitors from the Gulf States and one in particular,\
  \ who jumped out of his car in the middle of the night during a particularly heavy\
  \ rainstorm.\n\nWhen we ask why, he answers: \u201CHe\u2019d never seen rain before.\
  \ Not once. And he wanted to dance.\u201D\n\nIn our week long trip, we travel hundreds\
  \ of kilometres with Roshan and I\u2019m extraordinarily sad to say goodbye. I worry\
  \ I won\u2019t be able to find the right words so when he asks if we will visit\
  \ him again, I simply waggle my head."
