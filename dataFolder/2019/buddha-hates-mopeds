Text: "Touching down in Phuket was a surreal moment. Immediately off the plane the\
  \ heat and humidity stick to my skin and fill my throat. The smells of fried meats\
  \ and chili sauce assault my senses and I see a rush of Thai people swarming to\
  \ sell me various novelties from the area. After leaving the airport and arriving\
  \ at the villa, I set out to see the area. \n        Motorbikes are praised as the\
  \ best way to get around the rather large island. My group rents our bikes and we\
  \ set out for the Big Buddha, one of the largest Buddhist temples in the world.\
  \ A 30-minute ride, according to our host, and almost a straight shot up the road.\
  \ Wind whipping by, we drive through Rawai and start our ascent into the mountains\
  \ to find the massive monument. Following signs for the giant statue, we continue\
  \ up and up a road that grows more narrow each kilometer. Finally, the road comes\
  \ to a point where we ride one by one, pinned in by rails on both sides, the hill\
  \ becoming steeper and steeper. \n        Full throttle, our motorbikes slowly come\
  \ to a halt. We're walking from there, we heave the motorbikes up the hill, sweating\
  \ in the Asian sun and doing our best not to fall over the railing separates us\
  \ from the jungle below. Around the next bend, we see a sign, Big Buddha 1 km, with\
  \ an arrow pointing ahead at a road that seems to go straight up into the forest.\
  \ We emerge from the forest, covered in sweat, leaves, and bug bites to the foot\
  \ of the monument. Ahead of us is a statue 150 ft high, and the strangest location\
  \ for a marketplace we have ever seen. Hundreds of tourists and locals mill about\
  \ sipping on fruit shakes and eating rambutan, unbothered by the heat and palpable\
  \ humidity.\n       Spending our time recovering from the journey up and touring\
  \ temple we decide it's time to begin our descent. Back down, we figured, hey, can't\
  \ be worse than walking up was, so we jumped on and began the descent. Brakes screeching\
  \ as we attempted to ride down the hill without throwing ourselves over the edge\
  \ or ride into the back of the person ahead of us. After less than half a kilometer,\
  \ we decided it would be best to walk them down. After almost a 30-minute walk down\
  \ the hill, motorbikes in tow, we made it to an area where we could mount and ride\
  \ back down the rest of the way. We finally make it to the bottom of the hill and\
  \ continue north, away from the villa to find a restaurant to have dinner. After\
  \ a short 5 minute ride up the road, we arrive at a strip of tents selling street\
  \ food and souvenirs. After parking our bikes and walking around, we find a sign\
  \ marking the Big Buddha, and find a massive parking lot for motorbikes, and a free\
  \ bus ride to the top of the mountain up a far wider and gradual slope to the same\
  \ monument that we had spent the better part of the day attempting to reach.  Frustrated,\
  \ we eat and ride home, ending the longest journey of our young lives."
