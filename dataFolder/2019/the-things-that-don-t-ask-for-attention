Text: "Five years ago, my father told me I would be doing my pilgrimage, hajj, five\
  \ days before the journey was supposed to happen. When he told me, I was shocked\
  \ and then, I became nervous because I was not prepared. He was telling me this\
  \ news just five days before the trip to Makkah. I kept thinking that before taking\
  \ such a trip, I should have been preparing in advance, I should have made mental\
  \ preparations for such an important spiritual journey. The trip was not easy at\
  \ all. \nThat year, the Government decided whomever wanted to make the pilgrimage\
  \ would have to pay a fee for permission to do so. This did not go down well with\
  \ my family as we believe that no one should pay to worship God. Instead of backing\
  \ down, we were resilient. When we make up our minds to do something, no one can\
  \ stop my family and this is what made our hajj unique. \nAfter we reached Makkah,\
  \ my father told us of his \u2018brilliant\u2019 plan to escape the police and avoid\
  \ being sent home. During the hajj, we have to visit certain places at certain times.\
  \ The plan was, we would go to the first place, Arfat, two days earlier than we\
  \ were supposed to, so that we could get inside the borders before the Government\
  \ set up a blockade. \nMy sisters and I were shocked when we arrived and realized\
  \ that we would not be sleeping in a hotel, but rather in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ There were only empty stores which we used for shelter from the burning sun during\
  \ the day. At night, we left the stores to sleep in the cool night air. For two\
  \ days we stayed here, doing nothing but hoping the plan would succeed. At night,\
  \ a gang of dogs would keep us company, causing my sister to sleep in the car. Finally,\
  \ the two days of torture were over and the plan succeeded. We got into Arfat and\
  \ spent some hours there. Later that evening, we left to the second location, Muzdalifah.\
  \ \nAt Muzdalifah, we could not stay in the hotels even though there were many around\
  \ because the police would check to see if we had our permissions from the Government.\
  \ This is what happens when things are illegal. The only option we had, once again,\
  \ was the road. The road was crowded with people from different countries. I could\
  \ not sleep. It was too hot and people were continuously using the road to go to\
  \ and from places. Thankfully, the night ended and the next morning, we went to\
  \ my grandfather\u2019s house where we slept all day until the evening. \nThat evening,\
  \ we went to our third and final destination, Mina. Completing the hajj at Mina\
  \ requires walking 8 kilometers  for three consecutive days. My dad however, had\
  \ another plan up his sleeve. He parked the car close to Mina so we wouldn\u2019\
  t have to walk as much as other people. My father is a walking GPS, he knew the\
  \ place like the back of his hand, even though we do not live there. Finally, we\
  \ finished the hajj.\nAfter I finished, I realized that it was not torture at all.\
  \ Although it was very hot and most of the places were crowded, I enjoyed the walks.\
  \ In the middle of nowhere, there was nothing to do but, there was quiet, the fascinating\
  \ navy sky, the cool air and family. At Mina, when we were walking, there were sellers,\
  \ the sounds, the sunlight, the bridge and the shiny colors of buses. They made\
  \ an unforgettable scene. There are things that don\u2019t ask for attention. We\
  \ notice them when we reached a level of inner peace, and as a result of this, they\
  \ generate new feelings in us. We feel like our souls are fresh again.\n\n\n* I\
  \ got some help in grammar."
