Text: "As I peek through the airplane window, I can faintly see the multicolored pastel\
  \ palettes of each facade as they emerge from the cliffs peering over the Mediterranean.\
  \ Right then and there I knew this was a good idea.\n\nIt was only a few days ago\
  \ that I had sent an email to my new romantic encounter, Raffaella, containing nothing\
  \ more than copy of my flight itinerary. No questions asked, no permission sought,\
  \ just a roll of the dice.\n\nAs I fly overhead, I am anticipating ten days in Liguria,\
  \ Italy, with a woman I had met all but three times prior. A spontaneous gesture\
  \ in the pursuit of love.\n\nThe moment we reconvene we are both in shock, awe,\
  \ and pure delight. This was not my first time in Italy, but this was certainly\
  \ my first time experiencing the country through a local\u2019s eyes and heart.\
  \ My destination, Cinque Terre, was certainly not a bad place to start.\n\nEach\
  \ and every day we would wake up with the pursuit of \u201Cla dolce vida\u201D:\
  \ seeking beauty in each other and in the majestic landscapes we encounter. We would\
  \ become explorers of a land -- new to me and renewed for her -- touring by way\
  \ of Vespa, bicycle, train, boat, and foot through these most picturesque of villages.\n\
  \nWhile strolling through the heart of Cinque Terre along a cliffside path from\
  \ Riomaggiore to Manarola, we encounter the Via dell\u2019Amore -- the Way of Love.\
  \ We pass by hundreds of locks, bound to the handrail as a declaration of love by\
  \ preceding couples along what is considered the most romantic path in all of Italy.\
  \ \n\nWe know we have to mark our love as well. Without a lock we search for the\
  \ next best thing; a golden key ring would do the trick.  Now, we needed to find\
  \ a proper spot.  We peruse the vicinity.  The railing is saturated with the locks\
  \ of others, too crowded for our symbolic statement.  We look inland towards the\
  \ cliffs, and there upon the hill we see a stone plaque reading: \u2018Uomini siate\
  \ non pecore matte\u2019 -- translated to \u2018Men are not crazy sheep.\u2019 This\
  \ plaque beckons us, urging us not to follow the herd. We place the ring on a fortuitous\
  \ hook at the top of the plaque. The golden ring radiates in the viscous glow of\
  \ the late afternoon Italian sunlight, creating a stark and stunning contrast against\
  \ the grey stone backdrop; reminiscent of a Chiaroscuro. We smile and nonchalantly\
  \ continue with our stroll.\n\nThe following days would pass by ever so quickly\
  \ and after ten days of pure Mediterranean magic, I face the harsh reality of my\
  \ flight back to the concrete jungle of New York. Raffaella would remain in Italy\
  \ for several additional weeks with her family while I was back to the daily grind.\
  \ The next few days would pass as what would seem like an eternity, as juxtaposed\
  \ to how quickly they had flown by in Italy. I count down the seconds until we are\
  \ reunited.\n\nFinally, Raffaella returns to New York. When we reconvene we quickly\
  \ realize that we could never recreate what we had in Liguria; the fairy tale had\
  \ ended.  There were no more sunset Aperol Spritz aperitivos in Portofino; no more\
  \ stoney beach picnics in Vernazza; no more furtive maneuvers to evade village gossip\
  \ about her mystery American guest.  Italy was ultimately but an ephemeral escape\
  \ from reality.\n\nOur romance faded with the warmth of the Mediterranean. We ultimately\
  \ part ways, which had seemed unimaginable on the Via dell\u2019Amore.\n\nDays,\
  \ years, and romances have passed as we have continued on our separate journeys.\
  \ Yet every time I think about this trip I cannot help but smile. Was it worth it?\
  \ Absolutely. Would I do it again? 100%. For me, this is what traveling is all about.\n\
  \nAnd while I smile, I grin a little wider, knowing that I have left a little piece\
  \ of us in Liguria, marking a time when I was a little bit crazy, but certainly\
  \ not a sheep."
