Text: "Being the youngest daughter in a lower middle class family, with working class\
  \ parents who had dreams ahead to buy a house, a car, among other things, and, living\
  \ in Guadalajara, Mexico, I had never been out of my country and obviously never\
  \ travelled in a plane before, the farthest place I had ever been was into Guerrero\
  \ state, a 7-hour journey from my hometown. I didn\u2019t have many opportunities\
  \ to make extraordinary trips and it really wasn\u2019t my goal; until I met the\
  \ love of my life, Ethan.\nI met him in a popular beach of Mexico, Nuevo Vallarta,\
  \ three years before. He\u2019s British and came for a holiday with his family.\
  \ We met. Had a \u2018Summer Love\u2019 aged 14 years old. We kept in touch through\
  \ Facebook and one and a half year after he came back to ask me to be his girlfriend.\
  \ Since then we\u2019ve had a long distance relationship, but as we\u2019re both\
  \ young and studying in our countries we get to see each other, with luck, every\
  \ 6 months.\nOn my 17th birthday, my parents surprised me with plane tickets to\
  \ London. We got my passport; the necessary entry permits; some new clothes and\
  \ couple of presents for my boyfriend and family. I worked every day after school\
  \ as a waitress to have some money until the day arrived. I still ask my parents\
  \ why on earth they let me go to another country to stay in the house of some strangers.\
  \ They\xB4d never met Ethan\xB4s parents and I only saw them twice; all my parents\
  \ knew about Ethan is what I had told them.\nWe got to the airport; I was so nervous.\
  \ Said goodbye to my family, my dad was crying and asking if I still wanted to go,\
  \ he was scared of losing his little girl. Conversely, I was scared for if I didn\u2019\
  t find the correct flight or if, when I get there, no one picked me up, or if my\
  \ boyfriend\u2019s family didn\u2019t like me, I was even worried if they didn\u2019\
  t understand my English pronunciation, thousands of thoughts ran through my mind.\n\
  I found my gate easily and it wasn\u2019t a bad first flight. I loved seeing my\
  \ city then Mexico City from the sky: all those lights, houses and cars. The higher\
  \ the plane was, the smaller they got.\nThe flight Mexico-London began. I was delighted\
  \ to get the window seat that allowed me to see the dawn- beautiful radiant colours,\
  \ pearly, pink, purple. It was amazing. All the journey I tried to imagine everything\
  \ in England, trying to ignore my fears. By the time I landed, I had filled my phone\
  \ with photographs of the London skyline.\nI couldn\u2019t hide my excitement. All\
  \ I wanted was run to see my boyfriend, finally in the same country again.\nStill\
  \ having to go through passport control, I queued for 2 hours; when I was finally\
  \ there, they asked a lot of things: how, when, where I met my boyfriend, why was\
  \ I there, where I was going to stay, who was going to pick me up and even more.\
  \ I gave my boyfriend\u2019s mom phone number. Seeing how everyone just had to show\
  \ their passport, stayed a few seconds and walk out with no problem; I thought I\
  \ was going to get send back to Mexico.\nThey took me to a waiting-room. More people\
  \ that seemed to have the same problem as me where there. They took my fingerprints\
  \ and photocopied my passport as I cried. After verifying all I said, I was released.\n\
  I couldn\u2019t escape the trepidation and the excitement. I washed my face, sprayed\
  \ some perfume, change my top; getting ready to see Ethan again. I walked out and\
  \ he was there, distracted, but right in front of the doors. He saw me though. Ran\
  \ to me, not caring about the bars that divide the arrivals and the rest of the\
  \ people, and hugged me. A tight hug that made me feel like everything was alright;\
  \ he kissed me. It was all I needed.\n\u201CAnything worth having, is always worth\
  \ the wait\u201D\nIt was an amazing month.\nThe best holidays I had had until then\u2026"
