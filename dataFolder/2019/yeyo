Text: "I had spent the past three days in Belize and I did not like it. I had preferred\
  \ speaking Spanish to the Latinos there and avoided the English speaking Caribbeans.\
  \ I didn\u2019t like their overt sexuality. Empress, they\u2019d shout at me as\
  \ I crossed on the other side of the street. They\u2019d follow me around the Chinese\
  \ storefronts offering to buy me bottles. I liked the reserved quiet Guatemalans\
  \ that stuck to themselves. I also liked the pale, pale, freckled Mennonites that\
  \ also kept to themselves and sold watermelon and pineapple slices from their trucks.\
  \ Last night I was taken in by some Missionaries from America\u2019s heartland.\
  \ I let them buy me a ticket for the little boat that left for Honduras.\n\nThe\
  \ boat took off into blue tropical waters and I watched the island receding behind\
  \ me. It was peaceful, a little slice of paradise. On the boat were various tourists,\
  \ and a handful of locals. The languages mingled discordantly and I couldn\u2019\
  t tune them out. The lilting Patois of black women and their children, the staccato\
  \ Spanish of Mexicans from DF, the pleased singsong of heartland American vacationers.\
  \ There was a waif of an African tying up the boat. I wanted to make his acquaintance\
  \ so I offered him a cigarette and asked him about general directions. He took it\
  \ and smoked it slowly appraising me. He was skin and bones, about 40 but you could\
  \ never tell.\n\nWhen we arrived at the dock I unpacked and he finished with the\
  \ boat. The stations by the docks were small and whitewashed and beyond it lay an\
  \ unassuming town, with sun-stroked adobe buildings and unhealthy palms and banana\
  \ trees. So you want to go to the highway huh? Its not too hard, but you have to\
  \ walk a ways. That\u2019s my place, he said pointing to a standalone shack with\
  \ gaps in the planks. Let\u2019s go by and do some lines, I have good yeyo from\
  \ Panama.\n\nWe went down the dirt road to the door and he opened it for me, creaking\
  \ loudly all the way. The sun was coming through walls and more dirt drifted up\
  \ through the raised planks of the floor. He put a bump for me on the nightstand\
  \ and a bump for himself and he lined them up. I took it in, smiling and nodding\
  \ at my new friend. It was good, I felt it immediately; this was no Tylenol-like\
  \ shit you get in Toronto. He put the next one down for me, and then put one on\
  \ my thigh as I was bent down on it. I turned to him quizzically as he snorted it\
  \ up. He met my look with a crazy grin and reached down to a throbbing erection\
  \ through his pants. Okay then, thought I, and I got up and grabbed my shit. Skin\
  \ And Bones came from around the bed towards me, rubbing his cock. But just then,\
  \ there was a creeeaek from below, and the floorboards gave way beneath his feet,\
  \ dropping him through the floor down to his knees. I burst out laughing and let\
  \ the door creak closed behind me. Away from the sound of ocean and towards the\
  \ highway, I went."
