  \ trip I was solo in my life searching for soulmate at that time.This was the time\
  \ of new year everyone was busying making plan for new some planing for going somewhere\
  \ but I m one who was searching for some peace and good people.So when everyone\
  \ was busy in making plan I was also start thing about something then I came to\
  \ know about solo traveling so I thought of doing that but there was a problem that\
  \ was lack of courage of doing solo traveling because I never did that \nSo i perpared\
  \ myself n went to Rishikesh \nA small town in India ( this city is also called\
  \ the home of shiv  Indian god).I choose this town in Uttarakhand because there\
  \ i can find the some good people as well as some peace so this was the only place\
  \ which was fulfilled my expectations .so when I reached there I stayed in a hostel\
  \ that was also my first time I was staying at a hostel so when I reached at Rishikesh\
  \ in the morning 5am dogs was barking n I am all along walking on empty road all\
  \ alone everyone was sleeping but at that time when I was walking alone for the\
  \ first time as a travel this thing wakes me up for the whole life this things brings\
  \ the confidence in me.The pure air I am still feeling while writing this thing\
  \ feeing of freedom then when I went to my hostel \nI met some people there some\
  \ are from New Zealand some are from Australia but I m Indian hesitate to talk because\
  \ I m bit introvert so I went to walk ground all alone \nThen that was my first\
  \ day on the next day I went to pramart Niketan a place in Rishikesh where a aarti\
  \ happen every day there so I went there to find some Peace as till now I was unable\
  \ to find some friends so after the aarti finished I was sitting all along watching\
  \ the Ganga then a girl came to me she wants me to help her to blow her lights because\
  \ she wanted to do prayer after I helped her she came to me for saying thank you\
  \ and then suddenly I asked her r u traveling alone she said yes so I told her the\
  \ same thing she gave me her number and offered me to meet him tomorrow  so she\
  \ called me next day we both met and visit all the places together n almost visit\
  \ each and every place of Rishikesh so this is my story about my first solo trip\
  \ where I was successful in finding peace as well as friend :)"
