Text: "When I travelled to Sapporo, Japan with my partner, Clancy, I never expected\
  \ to find myself standing outside St Johns Wood.\nI grew up in the quiet suburb\
  \ of St John\u2019s Wood, Brisbane (not to be mistaken for its London counterpart,\
  \ but not helped by my also living on the befittingly-named Buckingham Street).\
  \ Having never travelled overseas, I was itching to escape Queensland\u2019s stifling\
  \ humidity and what was beginning to feel like cloying familiarity.\n\nIn the middle\
  \ of Winter, Clancy and I spent a few days slipping around Sapporo\u2019s icy streets.\
  \ He a meat-eater, and myself a vegetarian, we wandered around trying to find somewhere\
  \ that could accommodate both of us, ending up eating steaming hot dumplings on\
  \ the street, and watching tipsy businessmen fall over in fits of laughter before\
  \ clambering to their feet. We were cold, but happy, taro-filled dumplings warming\
  \ our bellies, which strained at our waistbands from the mountains of the food we\u2019\
  d eaten since we\u2019d arrived.\n\nClancy had lived in Sapporo years before, and\
  \ remembered just enough to navigate with some confidence. This feeling was also\
  \ present for him when attempting to speak the language \u2013 he was capable, but\
  \ frustrated by the gaps in his memory. Personally, I was more than a little impressed,\
  \ especially since the only phrase that I had managed to learn was \u2018toire wa\
  \ dokodesu ka?\u2019 (\u2018where is the toilet?\u2019).\n\nWhen we stumbled upon\
  \ the welcoming fa\xE7ade of a British pub, we shrugged, having preferred to find\
  \ a more traditional Japanese nightspot. Our frosty fingertips protested at our\
  \ preference, though, and so we made to go inside. As we did, Clancy looked up at\
  \ the sign above the door.\n\u2018I remember this pub,\u2019 he said, sounding pleased.\
  \ I looked up and read the lettering. St John\u2019s Wood. I laughed.\n\nWe had\
  \ managed to travel for eight hours by plane, to the Northern island of Hokkaido,\
  \ crossing water, time zones, and temperatures, and ended up standing outside the\
  \ most familiar of places.\n\nIt seemed I couldn\u2019t escape my home, no matter\
  \ how hard I might try. I found, though, that this wasn\u2019t such a bad thing.\
  \ In fact, it was an oddly comforting feeling. If Clancy\u2019s seeming satisfaction\
  \ was any indication, he too was experiencing the comfort of the familiar; in his\
  \ case brought upon by recalling the home he once resided in right here in Japan.\n\
  \nBut even beyond these evocations of home, was the sense that no matter where we\
  \ went, and how unfamiliar it may be, we would always be able to inspire this feeling\
  \ of the warmth and comfort of home. Because after all, home isn\u2019t a physical\
  \ place. Above all, it\u2019s a feeling. And that feeling would be accessible any\
  \ time I held Clancy\u2019s hand in my own. As we stood, all of a sudden in little\
  \ rush to enter the heated pub, despite the snow falling around our feet, I said\
  \ a silent, \u2018d\u014Dmo arigat\u014Dgozaimashita\u2019 (\u2018thank you very\
  \ much\u2019) to Clancy, for consistently being my home, at, and away, from home.\n\
  \nWhat do you know? I had learned another Japanese phrase, after all."
