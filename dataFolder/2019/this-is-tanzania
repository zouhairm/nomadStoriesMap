Text: "Dust. Everywhere. On the ground, drifting through the air, in my eyes, caking\
  \ my skin. A sudden rush of anxiety takes over my body as I step out of the grubby\
  \ airport building and into the streets of the place I will call home for the next\
  \ six months. Everything is different here and I don\u2019t yet know if that\u2019\
  s a good thing or not. \n\nTentatively, I sit on the bus and take in more of my\
  \ surroundings. The dirt roads, the wooden stalls selling anything from fruit to\
  \ mobile phones. The people. Their smooth skin draped in fabulous patterns and materials\
  \ as they wonder the streets. For them, all is normal. Even for the ones trekking\
  \ from vehicle to vehicle begging for money for their family. \u2018Mzungu,\u2019\
  \ they beg me. For I am rich to them, because the colour of my skin is not the same\
  \ as theirs. \n\nThe food is plain. Boiled rice, meat, beans. This is it, I realise.\
  \ Six months eating rice and beans. I can barely eat at the beginning, I am too\
  \ anxious. It\u2019s my first time away from home and I don\u2019t even have a phone\
  \ to call my mum. That\u2019s on the \u2018to-do list\u2019. I don\u2019t know what\u2019\
  s in store yet\u2026but the hostel is dirty. I am in a hostel for a few days and\
  \ it can be described as basic at best. The white tiled walls are no longer white,\
  \ the floor is unclean with unknown creatures taking charge almost everywhere you\
  \ look. \n\nShowering is a scary experience in which you grit your teeth throughout.\
  \ Although the sun is blazing outside, the freezing cold water is unbearable. It\u2019\
  s an experience you get through as quickly as you can. I\u2019m reminded that some\
  \ accommodation doesn\u2019t even have a shower, just a bucket. I\u2019m reminded\
  \ that this place is quite nice. I wonder when I will believe it. \n\nI\u2019m surrounded\
  \ by other people - the staff, Judy who is looking out for us while we\u2019re here,\
  \ other guests and the other volunteers. Why am I still uneasy? Maybe I\u2019m not\
  \ cut out for this. \n\nWe gather in one of our rooms, get to know each other, play\
  \ games. It\u2019s nice, we\u2019re in the same boat. I still want to go home, but\
  \ that\u2019s something I won\u2019t be sharing. Don\u2019t let them know you\u2019\
  re weak.\n\nThere\u2019s a sign warning us not to go near the \u2018street guys\u2019\
  . Apparently, they are bad people who will rob us. Great. Now I can\u2019t even\
  \ feel at ease walking in the streets. I want to experience the culture, I want\
  \ to feel it. But I\u2019m going to get robbed.\n\nAnd then I see it. We wander\
  \ through market stalls with incredible paintings of fierce lions, and strong elephants,\
  \ and local people. I am transfixed by the elegant materials that the happy seamstresses\
  \ can easily turn into skirts and tops. I watch skinny men, in nothing but a sheet\
  \ of material tied around their waist, carve wooden bowls and spoons. I drink in\
  \ the sight of the Maasai Mara Tribe members going about their daily business. The\
  \ materials so gracefully clothing them are different to the ones found on these\
  \ stalls. They\u2019re just as bright and colourful, but the patterns are noticeably\
  \ dissimilar. Their ears are stretched, sometimes down to their shoulders, and their\
  \ heads are shaved. Women carry babies against their chest or on their back, swaddled\
  \ in the fantastic materials being sold everywhere. People carry their shopping\
  \ on their heads. A normal practice. Nothing new.\n\nI spend eight nerve wracking\
  \ hours on a bus to reach my actual accommodation for the next few months. It is\
  \ decent. Simple. But it will be fine. We explore the area and are searching for\
  \ our schools when we hear them.  \u2018Mzungu!\u2019 \u2018Teacher!\u2019 \u2018\
  Mwalimu!\u2019 Then we see them. Around eight children come running towards us,\
  \ still shouting. Their hands touch my feet, my bare arms, they run through my hair.\
  \ They are happy we are here. \n\n\nI look out at the view around me. Dirt roads,\
  \ dusty air, and happiness. All surrounded by picturesque mountains. And I am at\
  \ peace. I am here. I, too, am happy. This is Tanzania."
