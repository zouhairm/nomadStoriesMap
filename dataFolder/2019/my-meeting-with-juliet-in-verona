Text: "Juliet & Juliette \n\nI swiftly run right to the ticket counter with 20 euros\
  \ clutched tightly in my right hand as my left hand cradles my cross body sling\
  \ bag. Afterall, it's Milano Centrale station and my Airbnb host has shared some\
  \ mugging anecdotes about it. It is already 10.30 am but the flurry of office goers,\
  \ students, backpackers and tourists is incessant. I am determined to beat the crowd\
  \ and get my train ticket to Verona, which would leave in 15 minutes. As I ask for\
  \ a return ticket to the stern-looking ticket master in my broken Italian, he immediately\
  \ asks me to get a voucher with a number and wait for my turn in his heavily accented\
  \ but immaculate English. \n\n\"There goes my 10.45 am train,\" I sigh to myself,\
  \ as I get my voucher from a teller machine. My turn won't be for the next 10 minutes,\
  \ am assured by a young office goer standing behind me. I shrug uncertainly as I\
  \ move to a corner to get away from a man who weirdly enough felt the need to peep\
  \ into my voucher to see my number, thankfully he disappears shortly. I heave a\
  \ sigh of relief and observe the magnificent architecture of the station, I also\
  \ observe the young backpackers plopped on the floor with a comfortable, laid-back\
  \ air about themselves, I then smell the deliciousness of Italian espresso wafting\
  \ my way from a coffee kiosk nearby, I check my phone hoping 10 minutes have passed\
  \ but realise only two minutes have passed at a glacial speed. In this technology-driven\
  \ world, instantaneous has become a way of life but here I am waiting for my turn,\
  \ may I add, a bit impatiently to get a ticket to Verona, where I would see the\
  \ much talked about: Juliet's balcony, tomb and statue. \n\nAfter a long wait and\
  \ missing my 10.45 am train, I board the next available train and start my voyage\
  \ to explore Romeo and Juliet's town. I don't know if it's the gentle rocking of\
  \ the train or the hundrum sleepiness of Italian countryside, but I wake up directly\
  \ in Verona after a refreshing 1.15 hour nap. After following the tourist herd for\
  \ 20 minutes, I am welcomed by the towering edifice of Centro Storico, the historical\
  \ city centre of Verona. It's a charming little town, which will remind you of Venice\
  \ sans the canal. The worn out cobblestone streets, the vine-decorated door arches,\
  \ the gelato vendors and street musicians, the pastle coloured houses and souvenir\
  \ stores, the Al fresco cafes and horsedrawn carriages, all seem like a perfect\
  \ setting for a romantic story . I can imagine Romeo and Juliet falling in love\
  \ here. Even a cynic like me can feel a sense of love in Verona. \n\nI wander aimlessly\
  \ through the streets and gallerias, I pass the same sets of tourists thrice, I\
  \ get lost in the piazzas but I am calm. The beauty of exploring Italy as someone\
  \ insightful has said, is in getting lost. I meander around and reach the ancient\
  \ part of the city, Ponte Pietra. This side of the city is diverse from the Centro\
  \ Storico. There is a sense of calm and mystic here. The houses don't have the pastel\
  \ hues, the cobblestone streets are dusty. The tourists have thinned out, the cafes\
  \ are more vacant and the prices are considerably lower. I decide to enjoy a glass\
  \ of vino owing to these lower prices, Juliet and her balcony would have to wait\
  \ for this cash-strapped student traveller. I choose a small contemporary-looking\
  \ bar that has an artwork on the window display. It reads, 'I'd rather be ridiculous\
  \ than be absolutely boring', it quickly resonates with me and I settle down on\
  \ a bar stool. It's a cute bar, not overtly old and dingy, trying hard to emote\
  \ a fake medieval charm like the ones in the historical centre. It's modishly decorated\
  \ in shades of cerulean and indigo with a total of three empty mahogany tables,\
  \ two bar stools and a bar. \n\nAs I am thinking of the juxtaposition of the existence\
  \  of this cool, modern bar, situated in a far, ancient corner of a small, medieval\
  \ city, the barmaid hands me the drinks menu. Her dark brown hair and eyes complement\
  \ her olive skin, as her small nose slightly inclines to the right. They have an\
  \ happy hour offer running right now, she informs softly in passable English. I\
  \ request her to surprise me with a wine of her liking. That seemed to make her\
  \ happy. She pours me and herself a glass of white wine and informs me that it's\
  \ a local wine meant to have in the afternoon. I taste it and love the freshness\
  \ of it. That first glass of white wine marks the beginning of our friendship. \n\
  \nWe talk about her life in Verona, her husband who works as a photographer on MSC\
  \ Cruises, her young son who loves Justin Bieber and her home above the bar. We\
  \ discuss her name and the renowned Shakespearen story behind it. We bond over the\
  \ similarities between Indians and Italians and of course she shares some Italian\
  \ recipes with me. She tells me of her dreams to travel the world and her deep desire\
  \ to visit India. I promised her to invite her to my big, Indian wedding, if and\
  \ when it happens. I tell her of my travels and my experiences in Milan and share\
  \ my plans with her of my next stop: Naples. She pours me another glass of wine\
  \ and says it's her treat. I gave her my Indian 'bandhni' scarf which she loves.\
  \ We share a plate of gnocchi and rosemary spiced roasted potatoes. \n\nWe talked\
  \ what seemed like a few hours and opened another bottle of wine and in that moment,\
  \ I felt like I was home. Back on my couch with a long lost friend, talking and\
  \ reminiscing. By the time we finished the bottle, it was time for me to head back\
  \ to the station to return to Milan. \n\nI didn't see the famed Juliet house, tomb\
  \ or balcony on my trip to Verona. But, I met a real Juliette who found a happy\
  \ ending with her Romeo. Who is full of love and warmth; who made me feel at home\
  \ in this medieval Italian city, far away from Mumbai. \n\nAs she said, I need not\
  \ worry as I have a reason to return to Verona so that I can see the imaginary Juliet's\
  \ balcony and meet the real Juliette over a bottle of wine. I am certain that someday\
  \ I will."
