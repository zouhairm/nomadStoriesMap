Text: "So this is about my last trip to Manali Himachal Pradesh, India. This wasn't\
  \ my first time to this place, I've been visiting it from a very long time.  People\
  \ wonder why so many travellers come to Manali. I\u2019ve been loving it since my\
  \ first trip maybe since childhood and the answer seems simple to me: because this\
  \ is the place where you don't have to go and look for a beautiful view, look around\
  \ where you're standing I bet the view will be no less than a scenery. If you want\
  \ to go for skiing you go to Auli and If you want to visit lakes you go to nainital.\
  \ But if you're a traveller not a tourist I'd say, you go to Manali . Because a\
  \ traveller sees what he sees, and a tourist sees what he has come to see.  What\
  \ I believe is traveling brings wisdom only to the wise, mountains, roads and rivers\
  \ everything will serve you as a teacher, the people you meet on your journey can\
  \ teach you life long lessons I promise  but travelling also renders the ignorant\
  \ more ignorant than ever. I usually enjoy everything that comes in my way, be it\
  \ any hurdle like we had a tire burst on our way and eventually it became a night\
  \ to remember. We stayed in a hotel nearby and enjoyed evening tea on the basin\
  \ of river Parvati. The night sleep was so peaceful, the roaring waves of the river\
  \ nearby and the pleasant air. All and all it was a beautiful experience, I'd never\
  \ get bored of manali or any other place no matter how many times I visit or how\
  \ many difficulties I may face. Everytime I come back from a place, it's a like\
  \ a software update of my system. I'm no more that same person I was before the\
  \ trip."
