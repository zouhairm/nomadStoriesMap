Text: "The old part of the city is placed high up in the mountains of east-central\
  \ Spain, situated above the gorges of the Hu\xE9car and the Jucar river below.The\
  \ old town is compact and all around it is green or stone. This idilic Spanish town\
  \ is located in the region of Castilla la Mancha, a region that has been designated\
  \ with UNESCO status due to its\u2019 wealth of monuments. This city has witnessed\
  \ thousands of years of history. \n\nIt is easy to get to and from Madrid to there\
  \ by train or bus and thus could be seen by some as a day trip. However, in order\
  \ to really immerse yourself in the atmosphere of cobbled streets and this part\
  \ of historic Spain you need to spend at least a weekend here.\n\nWe stayed at Pasada\
  \ de San Juan which was once the home of choir boys back in 1668, thanks to the\
  \ wishes of Mart\xEDnez del Mazo and his uncle Diego de Vel\xE1zquez who had previously\
  \ owned the location. The rooms are comfortable and it\u2019s amazing to get the\
  \ opportunity to stay somewhere as historic as this. It allows you to quite simply\
  \ step back in time. \n\nCuenca is most well known for it\u2019s hanging houses.\
  \ Built over a rock and situated above the gorge in the 15th century, Las Casas\
  \ Colgadas are the only remaining samples of this type of building which was once\
  \ common in this city. It is possible to enter the hanging house which is now a\
  \ modern art museum. \n\nThe views of the hanging houses and the Hu\xE9car River\
  \ gorge are spectacular from the Bridge of Saint Paul. You need a head for heights\
  \ to walk across this bridge that spans the width of the gorge. \n\nThere is however\
  \ a lot more to historic Cuenca. The Bishops Palace features a remarkable collection\
  \ of religious art. The star of the show has to be its\u2019 piece by El Greco and\
  \ the handcraft carpets by The School of Cuenca. \n\nCuenca is known to be a foodie\
  \ paradise and this is certainly the case. There are plenty of great places to choose\
  \ from. Our favourites were Figon del Huecar and Posada de San Jose\u2019s Restaurant.\
  \ Both of these restaurants offer a fantastic view over the Hu\xE9car River gorge\
  \ that you can enjoy whilst sipping your Spanish wine and eating tasty variations\
  \ of regional or country dishes. Cuenca has a passion for meat and tender lamb is\
  \ its\u2019 speciality. \n\nHead up to the remains of the Caste, which was once\
  \ an ancient Arab fortress. The castle was home of the Holy Inquisition after 1583,\
  \ and it was destroyed during the 9th century by French soldiers during the Spanish\
  \ War of Independence. The views from further up the hill are some of my favourite\
  \ memories of Cuenca.\n\nThe old convent of San Pablo is now a Parador, but you\
  \ can still enter and take tea in the courtyard or the old chapel, giving you a\
  \ sneak preview of this remarkable place. The convent of Saint Paul was built in\
  \ the 16th century by command of Juan del Pozo, a monk belonging to the Dominican\
  \ Order. The church was finished in the 18th century, in Rococo style. \n\nThe cathedral\
  \ of Our Lady of Grace and Saint Julian was built from 1182- 1270. The facade was\
  \ rebuilt after its\u2019 collapse in 1902. This creates an interesting mix between\
  \ the old and new. This can be clearly felt within the cathedral when walking around.\
  \ The cathedral is located on Plaza Mayor, which is the heart of the old town and\
  \ circled by lots of little tabernas, each offering seating on the square. Sitting\
  \ there then allows you to have yourself a Tinto de Verano while sitting in the\
  \ sun, all whilst taking in your surroundings. \n\nThe archaeology museum is a small\
  \ but interesting to museum to wonder around and it contains many Roman artists\
  \ from the Archaeological Park of Segobriga. \n\nBe sure to take your walking shoes\
  \ with you for this trip, as well as the area being hilly, you also have a multitude\
  \ of walks around the gorges and beyond if you have the time to spare during your\
  \ trip to Cuenca."
