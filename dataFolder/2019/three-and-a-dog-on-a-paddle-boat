Text: "We might have been one of the only Romanian girls who stepped foot in Kappalady,\
  \ a small fishermen village on the West side of the island. And I mean small: that\
  \ small, than even the tuk tuk driver raised an eyebrow once we told him where we\
  \ are heading to. But once we negotiated the price, we were on our way. By the way,\
  \ you ALWAYS negotiate the price ahead in Sri Lanka, not necessarily for making\
  \ an exceptional bargain (we are talking about less than 5 USD discount), but for\
  \ really entering the travelling game. \n\nThere are three types of people living\
  \ in this village: the fishermen and their families, the kite surfing instructors\
  \ and the tourists. It is easy to find English speakers, as the region was once\
  \ part of the Commonwealth. Useful indeed, as one of our hosts told us: \u201DWhen\
  \ you go to the beach and you see the sign with Sinhala characters, stay away. It\
  \ is the area where the army test their weapons.\u201D. In order to get to the ocean\
  \ you have to go round a lagoon. It is there where most of the fishermen have their\
  \ nets. We started walking in the late morning and by the time we got to the sign\
  \ it was already noon. We decided to return on the other part of the lagoon, as\
  \ a circuit always gives you the opportunity to discover more. There are little\
  \ people on that wide beach. The sun is burning and right now there are 50 degrees\
  \ C more than in our home country. Some women are walking towards us and they are\
  \ all covered in black and their eyes are the only ones showing. We know that it\
  \ is the Muslim custom but it is still a bit of cultural shock, especially on that\
  \ heat! There is a dog too on the beach. I think we look quite funny to it, because\
  \ it is following us. Or maybe that is the first dog in Asia that understands Romanian!\
  \ \n\nWe can see the roofs made of palm leafs and we know that we are close to the\
  \ village. Almost close. If we would have remember our geography class about what\
  \ lagoon is, we would have known that at one point it is connected to the ocean.\
  \ We have reached that point. We can't walk any further and we can't swim either,\
  \ as the current is quite strong. Turning back is a few hours hike under the burning\
  \ sun and on the hot sand. We are too mesmerized by the landscape so we don't have\
  \ a panic attack... yet. But the situation is not too bright. We can see one man\
  \ on the lagoon who is fixing his fishing nets. They leave them overnight to catch\
  \ as many fish as possible. He paddles towards us, standing on his boat. This is\
  \ the traditional way of sailing in this area: with this type of paddle boats that\
  \ require an incredible amount of equilibrium. He is now at the shore, next to us.\
  \ The fisherman doesn't speak, he just makes a gesture inviting us on his boat.\
  \ I am the first one to go, then my friend and the dog jumps as well. We are quite\
  \ afraid that the boat will not hold us all but we are trusting this chubby man\
  \ that is still in complete silence.  The fisherman comes on the boat too and starts\
  \ oaring with his long wooden paddle. He is the only one standing, while we are\
  \ sitting, holding each other tight. The ride is actually quite nice. We reach the\
  \ other shore safely and I look for some money to tip him. He makes a simple gesture\
  \ letting us know that there is no need for that and he returns back to his nets.\
  \ \n\nWe have a short walk back to our room. Everybody in the village, young or\
  \ old, greets us and smiles. Some even invite us in their homes. We feel like we\
  \ belong there and we suddenly gave up all our misconceptions about this country.\
  \ Maybe it here were true happiness was hiding!"
