Text: "It was 7:40 AM, I had to get it even if it meant subjecting myself through\
  \ the arduous ascent again even if it delayed our maiden Himalayan-trek. This was\
  \ the first time my eyes would see and body would feel the snow. Racing down the\
  \ green pastures and the Himalayan goats I picked it from my tent shoved it inside\
  \ my backpack and started ascending the path which I had scaled Ten minutes ago\
  \ breathing deeply the available oxygen in the thinning Himalayan air. I reached\
  \ the guide patiently waiting for my return, my trekking partner-Thafnitha was unhurriedly\
  \ ahead. Scanning the guide leading our attempt in conquering the 4342m high Indrahar\
  \ Pass Summit nestled in the Dhauladhar Himalayan range, he was almost Six-feet\
  \ tall middle aged man wearing a worn-out Khaki trousers with a tattered sweater\
  \ over an old check shirt my vision fixated on his loafer shoes!! Me and Thafnitha\
  \ were from the southern part of India which was of tropical climatic character.\
  \ Preparing for our first Himalayan-trek we went 'all out' on the required gear.\n\
  We reached our first rest point around 10 AM munched on few chocolate bars and continued\
  \ our ascent (our guide informed that we were making excellent time) with renewed\
  \ energy and spirit brushing aside Thafnitha's Fever and my bout of gastroenteritis,\
  \ dreaming of grand summit views.\nAround Sixty minutes into our climb the skies\
  \ showered the first raindrops (our guide called it a passing drizzle), drastically\
  \ it picked up the pace lashing our bodies. We quickly took cover beneath a huge\
  \ boulder. I reached inside my backpack and took out my raincoat (which I had questioned\
  \ taking along earlier on a blissful Himalayan day) to offer some protection from\
  \ the splashing rain and dropping temperature.The rain had now converted into a\
  \ hailstorm. With my hands now freezing, I reached into my backpack again pulling\
  \ out the fleece gloves retrieved earlier from the tent which was meant to provide\
  \ me warmth after I had 'danced' in the snow. Cramped under the boulder waiting\
  \ for the heavenly out-roar to stop, which did after Ninety minutes. The guide informed\
  \ we had to descend down to the base camp as precious minutes of our journey were\
  \ washed away. I contended with the guide that we had traveled too far to turn back\
  \ now (I was not going to have a failed first Himalayan-trek), the guide mumbling\
  \ to himself moving ahead followed by Thafnitha and then myself. I could hear a\
  \ Gaddi Himalayan shepherd bawling from afar \"Marnaa Chhathae ho\"(Do you have\
  \ a death wish) undeterred I quickly clambered ahead.\nThere it was my first snow,\
  \ a dicey narrow snow passage which was being crossed carefully by a teenage girl\
  \ and guide followed by her parents, they were returning from the summit. I eagerly\
  \ asked them about the summit, they reinforced my vision of witnessing pristine\
  \ Himalayan views but the kind woman cautioned we were heavy on time and she descended\
  \ down with her daughter. I was insisting to the Gentleman that this was our first\
  \ Himalayan-trek, he answered \"surely it wont be your last\" taking time he reasoned\
  \ with us that we were young and the mountain would not go anywhere we would make\
  \ it to the summit but descending down in the dark would be perilous. \n'Summit\
  \ Fever' had hit me and Thafnitha; audaciously moving ahead I never removed my gloves\
  \ to feel the snow. Our building weakness from the fever and gastroenteritis weighing\
  \ us down with every step. The altitude read 4100m on my watch looking up at the\
  \ boulder studded pathway we decided to turn back at 4:30 PM, even for us first\
  \ time Himalayan trekkers we knew attempting another two hour climb to the summit\
  \ and descending in the dark would be digging our graves and quite a bad one!\n\
  Moving down vigilantly our mountain boots gave way many times on the boulders landing\
  \ on our tail-bone, Our guide firmly leaping like a gazelle with his loafer shoes\
  \ between Thafnitha and myself to move faster, nearing the camp we slid down a glacier,\
  \ I finally got to have my fun in the snow. We reached base camp at 9 PM."
