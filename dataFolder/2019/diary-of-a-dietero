Text: "Your body floats limitlessly, suspended in a celestial pool of stars, you a\
  \ small white figure so insignificant to your galactic surroundings. Your body drops\
  \ and plunges into a pond of rippling constellations which transmutes into a seed\
  \ and plants itself into the soil of the Earth, creating new life in the form of\
  \ a seedling. \nMy foot is touched and my body responds instantly, as if overcome\
  \ by a higher power granting it movement and receptivity. I am once again dragged\
  \ back to the physical world and I now sit upright before him in the darkness, just\
  \ making out his slightly hunched silhouette. Hunched no doubt from his 50 years\
  \ of shamanic practice, spending half his time crawling silently back and forth\
  \ in ceremony space to each individual under the influence of the Shipibo people\u2019\
  s sacred medicine, ready to suplow them. I extend my hands forward pressed together\
  \ with my head bowed, ready to receive my energetic cleansing. This feeling almost\
  \ beyond my ability to describe, his ancient lungs bellow air into the crown of\
  \ my head and the palm of my two hands. Images of an ancient forest bowing in unison\
  \ to a mighty wind dancing between my vision, my body releasing all tension, making\
  \ space for the fresh breathe of new life that is being restored in every cell of\
  \ my porous body. He then slithers away as if embodying the spirit of the plant\
  \ he's been aligned with, Ayahuasca. I lay my head back on the pillow and look outside\
  \ beyond the netting protecting us within the space, I watch as fire flies dance\
  \ to the hum of the vivacious Amazon jungle."
