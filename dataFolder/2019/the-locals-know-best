Text: "It was a partly cloudy, albeit hot afternoon in San Juan, Puerto Rico and I\
  \ found myself trekking through El Yunque Rainforest on a quest. Leading the troop\
  \ was Pablo, a local guide who, although quiet, had an air to him that relayed a\
  \ kind and assured confidence that had already gained my trust. I had met Pablo\
  \ during one of my frequent visits to the local Mercado about two blocks away from\
  \ my Airbnb and stroke up a conversation over papayas. As an avid trier of new things,\
  \ I was determined to get through as many local dishes and native fruits as I could\
  \ during my stint in Puerto Rico, and papayas were next on my list. I had already\
  \ experienced the sweetness of the guava, sourness of the starfruit, and surprisingly\
  \ the tart, floral taste of lychees, which I was ecstatic to have found after experiencing\
  \ the fruit on a previous trip in Beijing. Pablo happened to be near me and, eager\
  \ to practice my Spanish, attempted to ask him how to buy the best papaya, with\
  \ words like \u201Cfirma\u201D and \u201Cblanda\u201D mixed in with English words\
  \ for the thoughts where my vocabulary was limited. He laughingly smiled at me,\
  \ then responded in English that it should feel similar to the palm of your hand,\
  \ and appear yellow in color. Embarrassed, I thanked him and began my search for\
  \ said papaya. Pablo wasn\u2019t letting me off the hook so easily though, and asked\
  \ where I was from. I told him Ohio, and that seemed to amuse him even more. He\
  \ asked more about my life and why I was in Puerto Rico, and I inquired the same\
  \ to him. I learned that Pablo grew up in Puerto Rico, that it was his home, and\
  \ that he loved it. He also told me that he led tours of the rainforest, caves,\
  \ and surrounding beach areas around the island. My ears immediately perked up.\
  \ As an avid hiker, I was excited to hear and see all that the rainforest was willing\
  \ to show me. Pablo and I exchanged information, and I set back out to my Airbnb.\
  \ \nAfter some arm twisting, I was able to convince my three other friends, who\
  \ were much less outdoorsy and much more content with lounging with wine and Mofongo\
  \ in Old San Juan, to embark on the journey with me. I contacted Pablo and three\
  \ hours later we were deep within the trees. I had convinced him to take us on one\
  \ of the harder off trail hikes (to my friends\u2019 dismay), and because of this\
  \ much of the hike was silent. The silence allowed for me to enjoy my surroundings,\
  \ and I right away noticed that the forest had a motherly beauty that I had never\
  \ experienced before. The brown soil was as slippery as wet marble, but perfectly\
  \ paired with the vines who reached out to provide support. The rocks across the\
  \ streams were placed wide enough for you to reach, but made you exert just enough\
  \ effort that gave you the childlike feeling of encountering and conquering something\
  \ new. We were taking our first steps all over again. \nAbout two and a half hours\
  \ in, I began to hear the faint roar of rushing water, and the louder it got the\
  \ faster I walked. My heart was pumping so fast that at one point I couldn\u2019\
  t determine which was louder, when upon one more turn, the trees gave way to a massive\
  \ waterfall. We jumped, swam, and laughed for hours.\nAt the end of our tour we\
  \ all crawled back into Pablo\u2019s truck, muddied and giggling. My friend\u2019\
  s had come around halfway through the hike and seemed to have enjoyed it just as\
  \ much if not more than I did. Finally, I realized why Pablo had referred to the\
  \ hike as a quest. Not because we were out seeking the waterfall, or because we\
  \ were out seeking a final destination, but because what we needed to find, we would.\
  \ Whatever we needed, the rainforest would provide, and Pablo knew that \u2013 he\
  \ knew his home. Back in town, Pablo pointed out his favorite diner, where we enjoyed\
  \ the best Mofongo and wine."
