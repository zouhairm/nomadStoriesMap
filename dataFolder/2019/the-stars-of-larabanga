Text: "My eyes squint as they meet the afternoon sun. It\u2019s been a full of day\
  \ of travelling and still another bus. It\u2019s 35 degrees Celsius and I\u2019\
  m wearing a cotton dress. Sweat gathers between my boobs and clings to the material,\
  \ only making it hotter to sit still. A part of me wonders if this trip is worth\
  \ it, as I try to separate my legs that are currently stuck together by sweat. I\u2019\
  ve never been to such a hot country and am slightly nervous about going to a rural\
  \ village with just Charlotte by my side. The bus station is crowded. We want to\
  \ walk and stretch our legs but don\u2019t have the energy to do so. We\u2019ve\
  \ been travelling for 30 hours, living on dried Indomi noodles and water sachets.\
  \ Our final bus enters the bus terminal. Black smoke escapes its exhaust and I choke\
  \ on just the idea that I\u2019m constantly breathing in such a mix of chaos and\
  \ chemicals. \n\nI wake up and it\u2019s sunset. We exit the bus with full bladders.\
  \ 630 kilometres in under 40 hours, with cramped necks. Yet, my anxiety of such\
  \ a long journey escapes me. We cross the road and land in front of the Salia Brother\u2019\
  s Guesthouse; a faded aqua-green house with a front yard filled with goats. Muhammad,\
  \ one of the twin Salia brothers, greets us and shows us to our room, also offering\
  \ the rooftop where he has put a mattress down for us to sleep. We thank him for\
  \ his kindness, drop our bags and make our way back to the main street for dinner.\n\
  \nSitting in a small shop, we chow down on a rice dish, sipping Sprites and watching\
  \ the sunset. Our only views include the identical shops across the dirt road, the\
  \ gorgeous sky, and children running past us in Barcelona jerseys. We ask the young\
  \ shopkeeper what the chaos is about. Barcelona is about to play a massive game\
  \ and the entire village is rooting them on. Within minutes, the sun is down and\
  \ we are being pulled along with groups of children to join. We follow narrow and\
  \ curvy paths until we reach a shack with a small door and the roar of excited children\
  \ inside. We open the door and the room is packed with children. On a bench in the\
  \ back they are joined by a few fathers holding tiny babies on their laps. I giggle\
  \ as I feel the energy of these little football lovers start to grow my excitement\
  \ for a sport I know absolutely nothing about. One of the fathers scoots everyone\
  \ down the back bench, allowing a small spot for us to sit. We squish into the seat\
  \ with the biggest smiles plastered across our faces. Ten years of friendship and\
  \ I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever been in such tight quarters. Each goal brings\
  \ a roar from the audience, kids jump up and share high fives. The room is hot and\
  \ sweaty. I am extremely uncomfortable but I don\u2019t dare get up. Their little\
  \ smiles, their genuine excitement watching their favorite team kick butt, and the\
  \ thrill of their two foreign guests joining in on the action; priceless. \n\nWhen\
  \ the game ends with a final winning goal from Barcelona, the kids scream with joy\
  \ and race through the village to share the good news. We follow suit and run like\
  \ goons through the streets, laughing child-like and foolishly as we mimic their\
  \ screams, dancing with them in the street. Mothers and sisters come out to clap\
  \ and cheer on the excitement. It is pitch black, except for the light of the blanket\
  \ of stars overhead, helping light their small faces filled with toothy smiles and\
  \ sweat. \n\nCharlotte and I ascend the handmade wooden ladder to the rooftop and\
  \ lay on the mattress to look up at the stars. Mohammad is also on the rooftop listening\
  \ to the radio. The village has finally gone silent. All that surrounds us is the\
  \ sound of nature and the radio announcer speaking in Arabic. We talk until we tire.\
  \ My eyes close and I can still see every star in the Larabanga sky."
