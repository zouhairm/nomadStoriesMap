Text: "My best friend and roomie once told me \u201CTake life as it comes!\u201D.\
  \ So on a fine Sunday morning, here I am in Shirdi, one of the renowned piligrim\
  \ spots of Southern India, in the Aurangabad district of the state of Maharashtra,\
  \ dedicated to Sri Shirdi Sai Baba. I had been here a few times before, but I\u2019\
  m yet unaware of the mystical adventures awaiting me this time around.\nAs I\u2019\
  m standing outside the main temple premises, just by the road side; feeling so peaceful\
  \ and quiet, after my Darshana, I hear a man shout out \u201CEllora! Ellora!\u201D\
  , as he walks up and down the road. He stops by me and asks \u201CDo you want to\
  \ go to Ellora?\u201D in the local language. \u201CHow much?\u201D I ask, as any\
  \ tourist would. \u201CWe charge fixed price, only 500 rupees\u201D he replies in\
  \ order to avoid any hassles of further bargain. I say \u201CYes, I will come along\u201D\
  \ and he directs me to a mini-bus, offers me a seat and asks me to wait until the\
  \ unoccupied seats in the bus are filled up. In a while, all the empty seats are\
  \ occupied and the bus is complete and I am ready to take \u2018my leap into the\
  \ unknown\u2019.\nAfter a 3 hours long drive, I find myself in front of a magnificent\
  \ structure, which looks like a fancy cave, cut off a huge mountain, with state\
  \ of the art sculptures all around, facing a vast vacant land and a pretty little\
  \ lawn.\nI deboard the bus and I am directed to a queue, where I see a notice board\
  \ which reads \u201CEntry fees : For Indians \u20B950, For Foreign Nationals \u20B9\
  600.\u201D I buy my ticket and also discover that this is a UNESCO world Heritage\
  \ site and a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India, as printed\
  \ on the ticket.\nI want to know a little more, before I actually enter the caves\
  \ and so I start by reading a display stone, which gives me a fair overview of the\
  \ place. <<This place is one of the largest rock-cut-monastery-temple cave complexes\
  \ in the world, carved out of Charanandri Hills, during the 1st millennium (600\
  \ - 1000 A.D). There are more than 100 caves, out of which 34 caves, dug side by\
  \ side of high basalt cliff, built in proximity, illustrate the religious harmony\
  \ that existed during the Rashtrakuta dynasty of ancient India. Of the 34 caves,\
  \ Caves 1 to 12, are Buddhist monasteries, caves 13 to 29 are dedicated to Hinduism,\
  \ of which Cave 16 also called as Kailasha temple, is the largest single monolithic\
  \ rock excavation in the world! The remaining 5 caves from 30 to 34 belong to Jainism\
  \ and are believed to be built during the Yadava dynasty>>. After reading this,\
  \ it feels like I\u2019m just out of history class at school.\nI imagine myself\
  \ on a time machine that takes me back in time to this mysterious land.\nFinally,\
  \ I enter Cave 16, which is right near the entrance. On first thoughts, I would\
  \ have started with Cave 1, as any logical person would, but keeping in mind the\
  \ huge number of caves, and the limited time at hand, I decide to see the best ones\
  \ first. So I follow my heart and the crowd, upstairs to Cave 16. A dark and dingy\
  \ cave, with a ray of light, just like a ray of hope! It\u2019s called Kailasha\
  \ temple for a reason, even though it might be abandoned, people still remove their\
  \ footwear before they enter the cave, with sheer reverence to Lord Shiva\u2019\
  s linga that rests on for millenniums within this powerful structure. Nandi stands\
  \ outside as a guard to his Lord. I decide to soon explore the other Hindu caves\
  \ quickly, by hopping in and out of them, without taking much time.\nAnother cave\
  \ that captures my attention is Cave 10 also called as Vishwakarma cave. It stands\
  \ out from all other Buddhist caves, due to its rich imagery and also because a\
  \ typical Buddhist chaitya plan has been merged with tantric Buddhist ideals.\n\
  My time is up and I have to take my bus back to Shirdi but I will come back for\
  \ more!"
