Text: "Goa is that travel destination that attracts millions of tourist from arround\
  \ the world for its beaches,  churches and museums. It's rich and diversified culture\
  \ from Portuguese,  Indian's and local goanes makes it more versatile and colourful.\
  \ This travel expedition was a discovery of joy and happiness when I visited Goa\
  \ for attending Marathon 2017. \nI am an avid runner so attending marathons at different\
  \ locations gives me an opportunity to explore different places,  cultures,  cuisines\
  \ and lifestyles of that particular place. When in Goa you can't resits the temptation\
  \ to visit beaches I was no exception.  I was lucky that my relative used to live\
  \ just near the Miramar beach at caranzalem. As part of my daily routine waking\
  \ up early is an habit at 5:00 am so I was off to early morning beach walking jogging\
  \ spree.  Just after the  day I finished my matathon the very next day this wonderful\
  \ beach experience happened.  I was indulging at beach by walking on the sand which\
  \ used to get a splash of waves every now and then.  It was a fascinating experience\
  \ which I enjoyed a lot.  While exploring the cool morning sea breeze and the serene\
  \ sound of waves splashing the seashore it simply provided the calmness and suttel\
  \ joy of positivity. \nWhen I reached the end of Miramar beach I was excited to\
  \ discovery sea shells that were swept away by the waves.  For me this was a soviner\
  \ from nature.  Not only I got one I got an handsome collection 8-9 sea shell of\
  \ same type which was awesome. The child in me was extremely happy to discover such\
  \ extravagant nature's gift. The feeling of this small happiness which could experience\
  \ was simply amazing. \nBy the time I was returning to my dwelling place it witness\
  \ an spectacular view of sun coming out of the trees.  Suddenly It sparked an idea\
  \ in my mind to do something creative.  I simply put down the sea shells collected\
  \ on the beach in a circular way. Exactly, a circular way so that it could replicate\
  \ the sun on sand.  It was a jubilant experience to not only discover an small nature's\
  \ gift but it inspired me to utilize that discovery for a new innovation.  I clicked\
  \ pictures of this wonderful piece and uploaded on my facebook wall terming it as\
  \ - \"Sun on Sand\". \nAfter couple of days later i was contacted by Mr. Deepak\
  \ Hiranandani an Goan who was on quest to write a book on a contemplative,  philosophical\
  \ or spiritual bent through social media.   He requested me to give him that picture\
  \ of sea shell which I clicked which I readily accepted and obliged. He not only\
  \ published this picture but he dedicated his last chapter of the book terming it\
  \ as Nostalgia and a tribute.  In this book he narrated his experience of visiting\
  \ the same beach in 1977 by discovering those same sea shell which I found in 2017.\
  \ It was simply astounding to me to have that same jubilant experience which he\
  \ had in those years when I was not born..... Simply facinating....!! \nThis never\
  \ before felt experience with mother nature would be long cherished in my life......!!"
