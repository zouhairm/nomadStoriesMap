Text: "The call came through. I recognised the voice immediately, despite not hearing\
  \ this voice for a few years.  Did I want to go to Barcelona to wat\xE7h his football\
  \ team compete against the best football team in the world?\n\nI could take or leave\
  \ the football but saying no to Barcelona. I couldn't.\n\nSix days later we landed\
  \ with very little provisions, no hotel, no football ticket but a desire to be part\
  \ of this majestic city we walked through.  The beautiful streets. The fountains.\
  \ The heat. The people. Everything seemed far more exotic than the north east of\
  \ Scotland. But darkness fell and we waded through the emptying streets, AM came\
  \ and we still didn't have anywhere to stay. \n\nOn seeing the universal hostel\
  \ sign we hoped that our charisma would open the locked doors, like puppies at the\
  \ door begging for conversation with the owner who had clearly just been woken by\
  \ us and wasn't accepting our Scottish charm. Eventually the lady opened the door\
  \ and we had a well earned sleep at an abnormal price. \n\nThe next day we took\
  \ a tour of the Nou Camp and met some other fans, went to an Irish bar, met even\
  \ more people, drank like we had money to throw away and enjoyed the Barcelona marina\
  \ in perfect weather. Later that night we went back to the hostel assuming we now\
  \ stayed there to find our belongings at reception with the owner telling us they\
  \ were full-up. And like the Scottish pups we were, we left.\n\nOn wandering the\
  \ streets we walked into an area where teenagers were just hanging around at 1am,\
  \ coupled with my kilt it was a reason to be ridiculed, in Spanish. But being the\
  \ Scots we are we didn't accept this. So we opened a bottle of whisky and started\
  \ drinking on a bench close-by, as if to tell these kids we had no fear. They drank\
  \ with us, smoked hash, played football and were a good laugh. \n\nThe night melted\
  \ away and daylight rose like sanctuary after that eerie night where we thought\
  \ these teens would turn on us. One of them even sold me a bit of hash, and at around\
  \ 4am with love I'd never experienced before we parted ways. It was game day and\
  \ we were shattered. We needed to sleep and did so inside some modern art in a stunning\
  \ park. It was only a few hours sleep but it was enough. \n\nThe next few hours\
  \ were plagued with anger as we'd, without realising it, been robbed of all our\
  \ euros By these lovely teens, and now we were screwed. We had loose change and\
  \ no ticket for the football. \n\nWe still had our passports and return flights\
  \ home and at that point we contemplated going to the airport and staying there\
  \ overnight until our flight at 3pm the next day. He was in tears. It was his team\
  \ after-all, and his birthday, I was just tagging along for the experience! \n\n\
  We had 12 euros left. \n\nEnough for lunch and a beer each at the Irish pub. As\
  \ the day went on more fans filled the place up. On seeing our woe these people\
  \ bought us food, drink and gave us spare cash in the hope that we'd find tickets.\
  \ \n\nThe game drew closer and hundreds of other vagrants joined the search for\
  \ tickets, eventually we found one. One ticket. With all the donations we'd been\
  \ given I had to do the right thing. I bought the ticket. He would experience it\
  \ all while I would linger around the stadium waiting. He hugged me and took-off\
  \ through the turnstiles. I was bitterly happy and sat outside the ground listening\
  \ to the pre match atmosphere with jealously.\n\nSuddenly an elderly Spaniard man\
  \ approached me and asked if I wanted into the game, he was able to use a spare\
  \ electronic swipe card and I was in. I thanked the man who looked for nothing from\
  \ me and walked off. I gazed at the amphitheatre styled stadium. I had no idea where\
  \ Michael was but we were both here, watching his team pull off a great upset to\
  \ beat Barcelona, in Barcelona!"
