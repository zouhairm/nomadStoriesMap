Text: "3-5-9-2. Nothing. 3-5-9-2. Nothing. Sigh!\nThere I was, trying to open my hostel's\
  \ door by punching in a code emailed to me by the hostel's staff the day before.\
  \ Everyone had already left for the day when I arrived late, thanks to my delayed\
  \ flight, in off-season in Ljubljana. No one in sight to\_call for help.\nFrom beginning\
  \ the day before to that moment, this solo trip to Slovenia wasn't going well. Incoming\
  \ monsoon had disrupted flights in and out of my port of exit, Mumbai in India.\
  \ I suffered heavy air turbulence, flooded airport, and risk of being stranded there\
  \ indefinitely. Eventually I did reach Istanbul, only to find my connecting flight\
  \ to Ljubljana delayed by couple of hours. Thus I found myself\_standing at a deserted\
  \ street corner in gathering darkness of early spring evening in that far-away city.\
  \ Alone, tired, and ready to cry.\nFrustrated, I kicked the door. It opened! Apparently\
  \ my code punching had succeeded without me realizing it.\nCursing my stupidity,\
  \ I started hauling my luggage upstairs to my assigned room. Then I saw Him.\_On\
  \ a pedestal on the first landing, sat the smiling Ganesha, god of auspicious beginnings\
  \ and destroyer of obstacles. In\_that empty hostel far away from home, to greet\
  \ atheist me, like an old prankster friend jumping out of shadows shrieking \"Surprise!\"\
  \nI smiled, bowed comically. As if a dark cloud had lifted. And I just knew that\
  \ my trip was going to be fine.\nIt certainly was."
