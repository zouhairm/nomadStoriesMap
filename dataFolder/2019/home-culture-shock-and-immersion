Text: "Can your own culture give you a culture shock? \nDoes it count as cultural\
  \ immersion if it is your own culture?\nIt was our daughter\u2019s first ever visit\
  \ to India. The day we landed in Bombay (Mumbai), we took our year-old daughter\
  \ to see a Ganpati idol immersion procession. It is Hindu belief that once year,\
  \ every year, the elephant headed god Ganesh or Ganpati visits earth for a period\
  \ of eleven days. On the eleventh day he is sent off with great pomp. Ganpati idols\
  \ worshiped over the past eleven days are immersed in water bodies. I grew up with\
  \ this festivity. I have been a happy part of it, yet my first thought was that\
  \ the noise and chaos might overwhelm our daughter. I thought the noise and general\
  \ chaos might overwhelm our daughter, but she pushed my hands off her ears and danced.\
  \ I thought I would be swept away, and she would be overwhelmed, but she was swept\
  \ away, and I was a little overwhelmed. A couple of days later, we had a traditional\
  \ Hindu prayer service to mark our daughter\u2019s first birthday as per the Hindu\
  \ calendar. The priest and the baby both did much better than expected. In fact,\
  \ they were both champs. Not only did the priest actively include me in all the\
  \ proceedings, he even pacified well-meaning relatives who tried to stop me. Our\
  \ daughter dealt with the heat, smoke and attention overload like it was just another\
  \ day.\nOur daughter dealt with the sensory overload that is Mumbai like a pro,\
  \ but for me it was somewhat of a shock. I always thought it would be the other\
  \ way around. Afterall, even after all these years, this was still home.  But coming\
  \ back is never the same as not going. It\u2019s not just everything around you,\
  \ it is also about how much you have changed. That\u2019s the real shock. Suddenly\
  \ the streets look smaller, traffic seems worse, familiar faces look older, fewer\
  \ people recognize you instantly, you recognize fewer people, you clutch your baby\
  \ close and hope the auto rickshaw won\u2019t overturn\u2026 There are good changes\
  \ too \u2013 no more plastic bags. Change is natural, but what hurts is that the\
  \ change has happened without you. I was stuck in a time warp. It was not exactly\
  \ where I left. Sometimes it was a little ahead, sometimes way back in time. It\
  \ took me an entire day to process everything. India can be overwhelming. Coming\
  \ back, even more."
