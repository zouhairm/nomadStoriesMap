Text: "As I walked down the edge of Jeju\u2019s volcanic mountain, the wind was harsh,\
  \ stinging the side of my face. Jeju Island, an island off the coast of Korea known\
  \ for its fresh citrus fruit, was especially temperamental that day. I had lived\
  \ in Korea for a little more than four months and in that short amount of time had\
  \ learned a great deal about both the beauty and strength that fills Korea. One\
  \ of the most glaring embodiments of this was what inspired me to slide down the\
  \ slippery path towards the water cove, where women three times my age readied for\
  \ everyday work: Haenyeos.\nLike most of my travels, my curiosity was fueled by\
  \ food. As a child I was overwhelmingly picky about what I ate, but as my taste\
  \ for travel grew, my taste for trying new things grew as well.  I was intrigued\
  \ by local cuisine and what it could inform me about the history of a country; families\
  \ insisting on breaking up their work day to have a full meal together, friends\
  \ meeting for afternoon tea, lovers going out to eat and drink for their 2am mealtime.\
  \ All of these interactions with food told me about the people who are eating it.\
  \ When I moved to Korea, I dove into the history of local foods and, serendipitously,\
  \ found out about the famous female Jeju divers. \n        \tHaenyeos are more than\
  \ fishermen; they are the backbone of Jeju Island spawned by a  tradition that began\
  \ centuries ago. There are different theories as to how it began, but amongst local\
  \ historians and people, common thought seems to be that it was a result of the\
  \ different Jeju massacres that had occurred throughout Korea\u2019s dark history\
  \ of invasion and control. Due to an overwhelming number of men dying, women became\
  \ the providers and hunters for their villages and families. Thus grew the number\
  \ of women suiting up to gather the crustaceans and seafood harvested in the coves.\
  \ At a young age, Haenyeos begin their training, taking on short dives and shallow\
  \ depths until they develop the strength and lung capacity to stay below the water\
  \ long enough to truly gather for the village. Over time, a matriarchal society\
  \ was developed in Jeju, with the Haenyeo as the leader of the family instead of\
  \ the traditional male head. This is a lifelong occupation, with the oldest Haenyeo\
  \ currently over 80 years old.\n        \tAs I reached the bottom of the pass, women\
  \ in full slick wetsuits geared up and gathered in a line to sing a traditional\
  \ song as they made their way to the cove water. They swung their nets and buoys\
  \ as their voices chanted the familiar notes. I watched them descend into the familiar\
  \ waters for what seemed like hours. Every few minutes a head would pop back to\
  \ the surface for a breath and then disappear again as flippers swung up to the\
  \ waterline and sank back in. With each breath, a Haenyeo travels for dozens of\
  \ meters before resurfacing. The strength, the resilience, the commitment of these\
  \ women over decades of their lives was both overwhelming and captivating. It was\
  \ so different than my life experience, a world away from my childhood home, my\
  \ occupation, my mother\u2019s occupation. And while these women, these mothers,\
  \ daughters, aunts, sisters seemed a world of difference away, the difference was\
  \ so beautiful and inspiring.  Breaking from traditional Korean gender roles, Jeju\
  \ women created somewhat of a history because of how they coped with loss and attained\
  \ food for the villages. Food had a deep and meaningful way of shaping the island\u2019\
  s way of life, starting a tradition that still lives on to this day.\n        \t\
  When the women came back up from the water, salt sliding off their wetsuits, they\
  \ laid down the baskets and nets of sea creatures they had retrieved during the\
  \ dive. They gestured for me to pick out an fresh abalone and octopus that dangled\
  \ over the edge of the market table. One of the Haenyeos, with the easy movements\
  \ of many decades of practice, chopped it up in front of me and stuck it on the\
  \ grill. Together, we ate."
