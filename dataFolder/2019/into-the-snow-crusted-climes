Text: "I decided to wing it. I came to Lima as an exchange student, but dropped out\
  \ of my university program in favor of the Peruvian rainforest. Leaving the jungle,\
  \ I got on a bus heading south, intending to web my way across the Southern Cone.\
  \ I had been a backpacker in the Appalachian mountains growing up, and although\
  \ I had packed my bags to Lima prepared for study rather than adventure, the promise\
  \ of forlorn trails scrabbling through wild mountains called my name. I found a\
  \ mention of the Torres del Paine national park and, heeding the impulse, I hopped\
  \ onto a bus bound for Punta Arenas, Chile. Though my Spanish had gotten better,\
  \ I hadn't quite translated the hot summer tidings of May in the American South\
  \ into the Southern hemisphere's May-time warning of winter. \n\nI returned to my\
  \ shabby bunk in the hostel all loaded down- summer sausage, dried bean soup, stove,\
  \ tent, tin pot. I had arrived that afternoon and my shuttle to the park was leaving\
  \ the next morning. It was already dark. I tried running my travel-tired mind through\
  \ the paces of calculating the exact minimum I needed to haul.  It was a five-day\
  \ backcountry hike, I was traveling solo, and so much fuel for so many meals comes\
  \ out to... I threw up my hands, surrendered to the travel exhaustion, and crammed\
  \ the lot into my pack. I gave the bag a test heave, and it was heavy -- at least\
  \ sixty pounds -- but I would make do.\n\nWhile most hikers went through the loop\
  \ widdershins, I settled on the opposite direction. I forged out over the stony\
  \ heath, crossing creeks and boggy hummocks, climbing in elevation ever towards\
  \ the peaks above me. Breathing in the wet, brisk mountain air, I soaked in vistas\
  \ of copper-green lakes and the moors trod by capering camelids. The first few days\
  \ were smooth. The morning of the fourth day, I awoke in the cramped camping shelter\
  \ that I had shared with a couple Irish hikers heading in the other direction. I\
  \ poked my head, still groggy with sleep, out of the shelter and was greeted with\
  \ a sky madly speckling white snow over the whole of everything. I suddenly re-assessed\
  \ my array of raiments, all cotton, and remembered the old backpacker saw: cotton\
  \ kills. It gets wet, and it no longer keeps you warm. I considered my cheap boots:\
  \ not waterproof. Well, there's only one way forward. In a nod towards a childhood\
  \ of making do, I lined my boots with a couple plastic grocery bags I had packed\
  \ and, thus shod, continued on my way.\n\nThe snow didn't stop. It blanketed the\
  \ rocks and bushes as far as I could see, a sudden undifferentiated landscape of\
  \ white. There were no footprints before me. I measured the depth against my cold,\
  \ wet pants with every step - five inches, seven, one foot. I slipped and fell in\
  \ the snow regularly, following the quick, clean line of gravity between my pack\
  \ and the mass of Earth.  Even worse, the deepening snow made it impossible to distinguish\
  \ the footworn trail from the gentle curve of brush that cradled it. The blazes\
  \ marking the trail were all painted, oh damnedable color, white.\n\nI started getting\
  \ Jack London. My profligacy in packing would come in handy: I had enough fuel to\
  \ last me if I got stranded; if I had fuel and I had snow, I had water; I had pounds\
  \ of summer sausage; and I had registered at the ranger station, so somebody would\
  \ come looking if I didn't show. But most important to remember: Don't stop. Keep\
  \ going.\n\nThe trail opened out for a moment onto a slope with a wide view of the\
  \ sky and valley. Then I saw the snow line: the valley was entirely clear of snow.\
  \ However many tens of hundreds of feet below me, the world was not snowbound. I\
  \ would have laughed if I could spare the energy. Late at night, I camped, sleepless\
  \ in the cold. I gritted through another soaked, freezing day in all-cotton couture.\
  \ Then I broke below the elevation, descending to the thawed world, and made it\
  \ back to warmth."
