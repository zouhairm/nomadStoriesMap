Text: "I travelled to Europe after filing for a divorce and decided to go to places\
  \ where I had no understanding of the local language and culture. It all began by\
  \ writing to the locals on a couch surfing website and asking them to help me with\
  \ accommodation. Finally after weeks of surfing online, I found a wonderful host\
  \ in Differdange, a small town cut off somewhere in the suburbs. As I got off the\
  \ train I found this sweet school teacher on the station had come to pick me up,\
  \ he showed me his house a self sustainable design with solar panels and a windmill\
  \ and asked me to take a tour around the city.  As I walked around gazing at the\
  \ picturesque green landscape I found this old retired couple who not only offered\
  \ me a ride but took me to see a train museum nearby. We connected as friends and\
  \ they told me how they were fascinated by my indian attire. After facing months\
  \ of trauma and judgement in my country I realised it was so easy to make friends\
  \ and open up to people in this beautiful country. I sat down told them my story\
  \ in English and we translated it to French for them. We spent the whole evening\
  \ chatting, drinking local wine and finally left me back to my destination. On the\
  \ way home I saw a bakery and upon enquiring about their amazing cakes on display\
  \ the head chef was kind enough to offer me a big piece of cake for free. His cakes\
  \ were like art, every cake had a story about the person who it was custom made\
  \ for, some even looked like a vangogh painting and that got me talking to him about\
  \ his work. He sat me down and told me how he made cakes like he would make music\
  \ and how it is therapeutic to bake and let go of the negatives one gets perturbed\
  \ with in life. My discussions made me realise I was now venting and letting go\
  \ of all the hate and anger I had within me and I had almost reached a state of\
  \ catharsis. The later part of the evening was spent baking a cake in his shop and\
  \ talking about my culture and life. When I got back home I feel energised, happy\
  \ and rejuvenated. My host made me traditional food which I accepted with gratitude\
  \ and slept the whole night peacefully thinking about my day and the amazing kind\
  \ people I had met who did not know me but had welcomed me with open hearts and\
  \ gave me smiles and laughter that I had missed out on for the longest time. The\
  \ next morning I visited a couple of castles , realised how they had put in a lot\
  \ of effort conserving their monuments, saw a photo exhibition on war called \u2018\
  The Family of Man\u2019 and made sketches sitting near the local cafe. I was coming\
  \ back to life, I hadn\u2019t sketched in ages and here I was with my first real\
  \ life sketch after almost 15 years. I am a qualified designer but somehow life\
  \ had got to me but the sweet gestures of people, the beauty and the uniqueness\
  \ of Luxembourg made me feel alive again and get my confidence back."
