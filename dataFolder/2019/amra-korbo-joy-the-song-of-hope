Text: "Kid- \u2018Amra korbo joy!\nAmra korbo joy!\nAmra korbo joy ek di!\nAha buker\
  \ gobheer,\nAche prottoy,\nAmra korbo joy ek di!\u2019\n\nMe- Is she singing 'We\
  \ shall overcome\u2019?\n\nFather- Yes! She loves this song.\n\nMe- (Smiles) Which\
  \ language is this?\n\nFather- Bengali.\n\nMe- She's very cute, and is a much better\
  \ singer than I am.\n\n(Everyone laughs)\n\nMother- We used to sing this to her\
  \ every night. It is our song.\n\n(Mother looks at father and both smile)\n\nMe-\
  \ 'Our song\u2019? Well, I do not mean to intrude but there seems to be a story\
  \ behind this?\n\nFather- (Laughs) It's a long story. The song gave strength to\
  \ the two of us during some really hard times.\n\nMe- Ohh! Well, it's a long journey.\
  \ Would you like to share?\n\n(Father looks at the mother, and she nods with a smile.\
  \ He then turns back to me and says...)\n\nFather- We met in Delhi during our college\
  \ days and from the first year itself, we were college love birds.\n\nMe- (smiles)\n\
  \nFarther- We had our ups and downs like any other couple, but we stayed together.\
  \ Even when both of us got placed in separate cities, we didn't lose our bond. In\
  \ fact, we used to meet every month. Whenever I\u2019d feel low or face problems\
  \ at work or with family, she sang this song to me and vice-versa.\n\nMother- (In\
  \ a rather serious tone) But real troubles were about to come.\n\nMe- Marriage?\
  \ Convincing parents?\n\nFather- Well, that was one part of it. I belong to a Bengali\
  \ Hindu family and she is a Kashmiri Muslim.\n\nMe- Ohh!\n\nMother- As you might\
  \ have guessed, both of our families were against it. My family forced me to quit\
  \ the job and even threatened to kill him.\n\nFather- My parents simply disowned\
  \ me. So, like any other Bollywood movie, we eloped. We quit our jobs and came to\
  \ Eastern India. It is comparatively harder to track down someone there.\n\nMother-\
  \ The song saw us through those times as well. With the money that we had earned\
  \ and saved, we spent some time outside India.\n\nFather- Later, I started a small\
  \ business in Guwahati which luckily gained some success. \_She got pregnant around\
  \ the same time, so we decided to get settled there. We haven't contacted our family\
  \ since, and we don't think they'll be looking for us anymore.\n\nMe- Well, that\
  \ truly is like a Bollywood story.\n\n(Everyone laughs)\n\nMother- It is indeed.\
  \ We too laugh about it often.\n\nFarther- So, that's why we call this 'Our Song\u2019\
  , as it gave us a lot of strength and courage to deal with many such situations\
  \ in our life so far and our daughter loves it too, so we sing it to her every night.\
  \ Right baby?\n\nKid- \u2018Amra korbo joy!\nAmra korbo joy!\nAmra korbo joy ek\
  \ di!\u2019\n\nMe- (Laughs) Wait a second. Hey, bro! Do you know how to play 'We\
  \ shall overcome\u2019 on your Ukulele?\n\nBro- I can try. Shouldn\u2019t be difficult.\n\
  \nMe- Come here then. Play it for her.\n\nBro- Sure!\n\n(Strumming Ukulele)\n\n\u2018\
  Amra korbo joy!\nAmra korbo joy!\nAmra korbo joy ek di!\n\nDeep in my heart,\nI\
  \ do believe,\n\nHum honge kaamyab, ek din!\u2019"
