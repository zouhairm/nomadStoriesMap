Text: "In January I travelled to Malta with three friends from my meditation society.\
  \ As we learned about the Maltese way of life we realised how ridiculous our own\
  \ lives were. The Maltese don\u2019t give a fuck. They are so chill. It is inspiring.\
  \ We run around Dublin making ourselves so busy we are sick and then meditate to\
  \ try and find balance. It worries me how the Mediterranean way of life, the Italian\
  \ pleasure of doing nothing, shocks me every time, when it is so normal. It makes\
  \ so much sense.\nOf course, it is not fair to lump the Maltese in with the Italians.\
  \ They are truly a nation of their own. Looking around at the architecture and the\
  \ horticulture we can see hints of Greece, maybe Africa, Spain. The plants are so\
  \ dry, nearly like desert plants. We had no real preconceptions of what Malta would\
  \ be like and, on arrival, it was clear that Malta has an air that is difficult\
  \ to describe. As an island it has something unique about it, a certain feel and\
  \ a certain way of life. \nAs it was rather off-season (early January) many museums\
  \ and galleries in Valletta were closed. It was refreshing to not be surrounded\
  \ by more tourists and to just wander aimlessly, acquainting ourselves with the\
  \ city, not feeling the need to do or see anything in particular. A highlight of\
  \ the day was drinking remarkably cheap limoncellos in a caf\xE9 with the winter\
  \ sun warming us. \nWe did, however, pop into Spazju Kreattiv, the national centre\
  \ for creativity. The building was designed as an artillery platform, so is rather\
  \ functional but the interior aesthetics make up for this. Displaying all forms\
  \ of creative arts from video to theatre, Spazju Kreattiv has an incredibly chill\
  \ vibe, without the pressure or posterity that many contemporary museums or galleries\
  \ have nowadays. \nOur second day was spent in Mdina/Rabat, the old capital of Malta.\
  \ Here we explored the medieval walled city and St. Paul\u2019s catacombs. As beautiful\
  \ as the surroundings were, the most memorable part of the day was tasting our first\
  \ patizzis. We bought two each as they cost 40 cent so we feared that they would\
  \ be too small a snack. How wrong we were! Patizzis are traditional Maltese pastries\
  \ filled with either ricotta cheese or mushy peas. They were bizarrely indulgent.\
  \ They served as another reminder of the Maltese way, moving slowly and enjoying\
  \ life. \nThe final day of our trip was spent in Gozo where, before returning to\
  \ our beautiful, incredibly cheap Airbnb in St.Paul\u2019s Bay, we enjoyed a sunset\
  \ swim. Even though it was January and rather cold, we were eager to get in the\
  \ water. The view was spectacular. There is something about Malta that is just so\
  \ foreign, so different to home, that makes you hyper-aware that you are on your\
  \ holidays, that this is a special time to be in the present moment and forget about\
  \ the stress you carry around at home. As the sun set behind us, we watched ferries\
  \ come in and out of the dock. This wasn\u2019t a holiday for doing and seeing,\
  \ it was a veritable break from the monotonous every day, it was indulgence and\
  \ basking in the pleasure of our surroundings.\nI would recommend anyone who wants\
  \ to switch off and forget life as they know it in a bustling city to go to Malta.\
  \ As we took the bus (unreliable but so cheap in comparison to Dublin!) to the airport,\
  \ I looked at little houses on hills and dreamed of returning one day for a writing\
  \ retreat. I feel that the calmness of Malta is conducive to creativity and, honestly,\
  \ a happy life. I believe it is very, very difficult to be sad in Malta."
