Text: "Travel anywhere in the world and keep on exploring beautiful places , but you\
  \ can never have an experience of being complete within yourselves until you visit\
  \ the city with people having golden hearts. It is the Golden temple , Amritsar\
  \ .\n\nAmritsar is a city located at Punjab state in northern India and also has\
  \ a historical importance of the independence days for India . The city is known\
  \ as one of the oldest cities of times with old monuments and houses across the\
  \ way to Golden temple. The best punjabi delicacies are mouth watering with Indian\
  \ flat bread and butter chicken curry with Indian spices and masala available in\
  \ cheap prices all over the place.\n\nThe best part comes when the visit to the\
  \ golden temple starts. Either you can walk or take a rickshaw ride which is a marvellous\
  \ experience and then you see a white temple spread over looks shinning and sparkling\
  \ in the sun like a beautiful treasure. Once you enter , the peacefulness and the\
  \ murmering sound of the place takes you to another heaven. The pool located at\
  \ the heart of thetemple is of religious importance, but so calming to watch the\
  \ golden temple through the pool that you feel like sitting the whole day like this.\n\
  Apart from this there is a huge story about the temple and the history which makes\
  \ you cry listening although. Now you make a queue to enter into the main door of\
  \ the temple and experience surreal wonder and peace.\n\nComing out you are given\
  \ a chance there to serve people voluntarily and it ia nothing but the \"Langar\"\
  . Basically it is the place where thousands of people are being fed free of cost\
  \ day and night and hundreds of people work there day and night to make it as much\
  \ as they can. The food is so delicious that it can make you full throughout the\
  \ day. There is no discrimination of rich and poor there and it is the one place\
  \ where you see all people equal. \nWhat a wonderful experience and the warmth of\
  \ the people made me feel like staying over there for days together and keep on\
  \ experience the bliss.\n\nA must visit place in India to have the most peaceful\
  \ surreal view along with the feel of the best self within yourself."
