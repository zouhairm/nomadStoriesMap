Text: "Spencer and I were best buds in college. But after graduation he moved east\
  \ to New York City to chase his dream of professional photography, and I moved a\
  \ good deal farther east to teach English in Japan. Nearly four years on, Spencer\
  \ had arrived for a visit, and we were reunited for a hike in Shikoku, the smallest\
  \ of Japan\u2019s main islands.\n\nOur adventure started in Iya Valley. To get there,\
  \ we had to leave modern Japan behind. Narrow lanes escorted us around crooked hairpins\
  \ and along steep ledges to forgotten settlements tucked away in the mountains.\n\
  \nAt 1983 meters, Mt. Miune is only about half the size of the iconic Mt. Fuji,\
  \ and even in Shikoku there are certainly more notable peaks. But of course, we\
  \ had opted for the unconventional. Our destination was as unfamiliar as the two\
  \ of us had become, so with curiosity and a late start we headed up the track. \n\
  \nForced to save our breath for breathing, twisted grins took the place of small\
  \ talk as we trudged uphill. Although more grueling than we had anticipated, the\
  \ physical strain eased the nerves of getting reacquainted, and each step seemed\
  \ to endorse the promise of a greater reward ahead. \n\nFew and far between, cheerful\
  \ greetings of \u201CKonnichiwa!\u201D broke the hush when we chanced upon other\
  \ trampers. In every encounter, our surprise was well surpassed by their astonishment\
  \ at the sight of two tall Westerners wandering the backwoods. One bewildered passerby\
  \ even begged for a photo, convinced he was standing with Tom Cruise as he flung\
  \ his arm around Spencer\u2019s shoulder. \n\nNearing the top, we discovered a deep\
  \ pond beyond the tree line. A cabin marked \u2018Miune Hut\u2019 stood at the edge,\
  \ offering the perfect retreat for weary travelers after six kilometers of relentless\
  \ incline. But with daylight to spare we pressed on, tracing the rim of the crater\
  \ towards the final rise.\n\nIf our breath hadn\u2019t been lost during the climb,\
  \ the view would have taken it away. \n\nThe horizon was corrugated with the soft\
  \ crests of the yellow-green sea of mountains that sprawled in every direction.\
  \ Fields of bamboo grass fleeced the mountains in gold, and the ground fell away\
  \ sharply to either side of narrow footpaths etched along the ridgelines like rope\
  \ bridges stretched between the peaks. \n\nThe grass brushed against our ankles\
  \ in places and rose above our waists in others as we waded through this savanna\
  \ in the sky. All those steps had paid off. We were on top of the world, and with\
  \ each stride the weariness in our legs faded away. \n\nWe cruised along the ridge,\
  \ leaving behind the peak that we thought had been our goal. Any rift between us\
  \ evaporated like the sweat on our backs as we drifted up here above Iya.\n\nThree\
  \ and a half kilometers and we came to a shabby signpost. \u201CHey! There\u2019\
  s water over here!\u201D declared one sign playfully in Japanese, pointing down\
  \ the bank to the right. \u201CThe water over here is also delicious!\u201D teased\
  \ another pointing left. Empty bottles in hand, we took off towards the sound of\
  \ the stream and captured the clear water as it trickled through the moss. \n\n\
  A third sign read \"Okamegan Cabin,\" literally \u2018Turtle Rock Cabin,\u2019 marking\
  \ the shelter no doubt named for the massive boulder sitting on the ridge above.\
  \ We had stumbled upon our home for the night. Ditching our packs, we laid out our\
  \ sleeping bags and scrambled up the rock just in time for sunset. \n\n\u201CLook!\u201D\
  \ I shouted, in awe that the view could get any better. \u201CYou can see clear\
  \ across Shikoku!\u201D \n\nSure enough, to the south we could see the Pacific coast\
  \ freckled with faint lights, and to the north we could make out small islands rising\
  \ out of the inland sea between Shikoku and Japan\u2019s largest island of Honshu.\
  \ This place seemed to have a knack for bringing things together.\n\nMiles away\
  \ and high above the glow of civilization, a thick darkness soon engulfed Turtle\
  \ Rock. But as one view dissolved, another took its place. Above us the Milky Way\
  \ swept across the sky."
