Text: "My Story\n\nAn Expected Unexpected\n\nFirst of all, to explain what I didn\xB4\
  t expect I have to express what I did expect.\nNot much time ago I spent a few months\
  \ in Bordeaux, France, but I had the luck to go visit Paris, and other cities all\
  \ over France so I\xB4m writing about France in general, not just Bordeaux. Also\
  \ I would like to clear out that I am from Mexico and that I had never been in Europe\
  \ before.\n I expected whatever you see in old and latest movies that take place\
  \ in France and what most other people think about it. The glamour, the elegance,\
  \ the fluid French, the Art and history, the romance. \nI didn\xB4t expect to find\
  \ out that there is glamour, but for not so many people, most of French people just\
  \ go to work and live their lives making groceries and drinking coffee in small\
  \ local cafeterias where I found so much more charm than in glamorous rooftops or\
  \ expensive restaurants.\nThere was elegance, but in a different way, there was\
  \ elegance in people\xB4s lives, how they walk in the streets with such grace, there\
  \ it was in the buildings and the stores, it had nothing to do with elegant people,\
  \ it was just in the atmosphere.\nThere was fluid French, I learned it and I got\
  \ to talk quite well, but I never expected that the friends I got to know there\
  \ were mostly latin people, and the language I spoke and listened the most, was\
  \ Spanish.\nThere is a lot of history, tons of art. And it mixes very well. I see\
  \ contemporain art as one of my favorite expressions, but in France, there is so\
  \ much classic and ancient art that is almost impossible not being intrigued by\
  \ it. French history is interesting, exciting and tragic, all at the same time which\
  \ I find in almost all countries\xB4 history, so I focused in the Art\xB4s history.\
  \ As I entered to the most popular and important museums I never expected the feeling\
  \ I was going to get. It was absolutely intriguing. Everything I could think about\
  \ as I stared to a painting, or a sculpture was: what was the artist thinking as\
  \ he or she stared at the blank canvas? Did he know exactly what he wanted? Was\
  \ he satisfied with the result? \u2026 I imagined the person making his first brush\
  \ or his first sketch, and I wouldn\xB4t stop wondering how would these people feel\
  \ if they knew that people from all around the world come to see and appreciate\
  \ their work so many years later. That feeling of questioning was absolutely my\
  \ favorite.\nThere was romance in my journey. I fell in love profoundly. I fell\
  \ in love with the place and its people, I fell in love with the streets and with\
  \ a young gentleman who wasn\xB4t romantic at all, but I found out that this kind\
  \ of romance has been with me all along, I tend to fall for new experiences.\nI\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find out that everything went so much better than I expected."
