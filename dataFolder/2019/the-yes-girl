Text: "\u201CJust be a Yes girl\u201D I said to myself.\nIt be became my two word\
  \ mantra, a catch phrase borrowed from a 90s comedy film Yes Man, starring Jim Carrey.\
  \  Choosing yes became both a nagging voice and powerful reminder to expand my horizons.\n\
  I had no expectations and my only goal being to say Yes to opportunity.  A multitude\
  \ experiences eventually boiled down to some very powerful words.  Words that have\
  \ come to hold significant meaning in my life.\n\n\u201CSure!\u201D  I jump onto\
  \ the back of his motorcycle. You are much older than I am, you\u2019ve recently\
  \ been released after four years in prison. We are from different worlds. Weaving\
  \ through the heavily populated island of Bali, surfboards in tow, I observe. The\
  \ richness of a sacred, spiritual island known for its peaceful people and culture\
  \ of which, the powerful energy is undeniable. My arms are wrapped around an aggressive\
  \ and volatile man. A tourist who doesn\u2019t notice or care about the island beyond\
  \ its inexpensive commodities and world class surf. An exhilarating experience littered\
  \ with gluttony and guilt.  I\u2019m here for this, the experience, whatever it\
  \ may be. What stuck with me was the magnitude of     Contrast.\n\nIt\u2019s 4:30am.\
  \ Meditation is a new thing I\u2019m trying out. Recently I\u2019ve decided to incorporate\
  \ it into my morning routine. Eleven days of silence I\u2019ve just completed highlights\
  \ the act of observing ones thoughts without attaching to them.  There might be\
  \ something to this? I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s too soon to tell. I\u2019m work\
  \ in Bali and as I\u2019m sitting at my desk I am casually approached by a curiosity\
  \ filled seven year old student. Deep in thought she inquires \u201CMs.?\u201D \
  \ \u201CDo plants also need food, water and rice to survive like humans do?\u201D\
  \ I pause and reflect. Rice, I realize, might represent more than just a food. \
  \ Moments like these are priceless. I\u2019m left with a feeling to contemplate,\
  \ the word that I land on is      perspective.\n\nIt\u2019s charming and quaint,\
  \ with cobblestone streets.  I\u2019m excited for a semester of university in Mexico\
  \ and I\u2019m confident I\u2019ve got a pretty good idea of what I\u2019m in for.\
  \  I\u2019m the only one in my class. Why is the school so empty? It\u2019s just\
  \ me exploring the beautiful campus, a designated UNESCO world heritage site. \u201C\
  Take precautions\u201D they advise. \u201CBe leery of cars with tinted windows\u201D\
  \ It hits me, this place is dangerous. I\u2019m well traveled at this point in my\
  \ life but I\u2019m caught off guard nonetheless. I\u2019m committed to finishing\
  \ school and I really do need the credits. I begin to operate with a constant level\
  \ of anxiety, fear and depressing reality of the current situation affecting the\
  \ country. I\u2019m home watching a movie and so are the neighbors. I can hear their\
  \ loud TV. Bang, silence and screaming. I don\u2019t enjoy violent movies. Wait\
  \ a second, shit, it\u2019s not a movie. My neighbor has been shot and killed. I\
  \ am next door and I hear it all. I\u2019ve said yes to an experience that teaches\
  \ me a lot. I\u2019ve scratched the surface of       violence.  \n\nThe guy I met\
  \ last night rolls out of bed throws on his jeans and asks if I want  to join him.\
  \ \u201CYes I\u2019ll come.\u201D We hustle out the door and into a taxi. An expert\
  \ driver confidently navigating the busy streets of Lima drops us off. We arrive\
  \ in good time but for what I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m giddy with anticipation\
  \ of the unknown.  And then I find myself at a modeling shoot for a local skateboard\
  \ magazine. Then off to a clothing outlet store. Wow he\u2019s cute, this is fun!\
  \ He tells me to take anything I want from the store. For a moment I feel rich and\
  \ famous. I settle on a black skirt and contemplate uninhibited    spontaneity.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019m back to work in Canada. Tomorrow I\u2019ll head to South America\
  \ with fifteen high school students. My job is to teach them Spanish but my purpose\
  \ is to encourage them to choose \"yes\". A two word phrase and invaluable lesson\
  \ later I've learned. Judge a little bit less and listen and little bit more. The\
  \ destination isn\u2019t clear but the way forward is."
