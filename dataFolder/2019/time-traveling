Text: "Some people say they travel for the experience of being in a complete different\
  \ setting, listening to different languages, eating exotic food and mingling with\
  \ locals. You know, the whole travelling vibe. I say I travel because travelling\
  \ makes me gain perspective about life and about myself.\n\nWhat if there was one\
  \ place on earth where you\u2019ve dreamed of being at since you were 15 years of\
  \ age (and now you are turning 30)? What if every time you planned to visit this\
  \ place it all really just happened in your dreams and wildest thoughts? Like if\
  \ the whole universe was conspiring to deprive you from this lifetime experience.\
  \ Well that was me, or at least I thought that was my case. This is my story of\
  \ a platonic love affair with Spain. \n\nFastforwarding 14 years I had not gone\
  \ to my dream destination. But it all still fascinated me: the idea of being there,\
  \ looking at all the different colours around, the majestic Gaudi architecture,\
  \ the parks and long siestas, the food, the classic sangrias and the music! Ahh\
  \ the music!\n\nSo one day I woke and told myself, you need to make this happen\
  \ and it needs to happen before another 15 years go by! Yes I wanted to live my\
  \ teenage dream turning 30! But hey it\u2019s never to late to dream and certainly\
  \ never to late to travel. If anything, I learned that we need to fight for our\
  \ dreams and they need to be a priority in our lives. So I save all the dimes I\
  \ had and bought a ticket and a bus tour to Spain. The 13th of July I woke up in\
  \ the glorious Barcelona, 15 years after I first dreamed of being there. It was\
  \ a magical experience, like if I was time travelling and I was that young girl\
  \ again. \n\nDuring the next 15 days in Spain I lived a journey of self-discovery\
  \ and exploring of not only this beautiful location, but also of who I had become.\
  \ I had the opportunity of refresh and reset. To start thinking of how the next\
  \ 15 years could look like and what I would need to do to get there.\n\nIf I could\
  \ give a word of advice to anyone who like myself, keep on making excuses why you\
  \ can\u2019t travel to those places you think you can only dream of, it\u2019s to\
  \ fight for your dreams! You won\u2019t regret it, but you will if you just let\
  \ time pass you by. So get that cash saved, clean up some tables if need be! Just\
  \ do something about your dreams, they don\u2019t grow old."
