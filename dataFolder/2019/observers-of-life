Text: "When I wake up, I usually eat before leaving anywhere. After eating I try to\
  \ find some way of getting outside to experience life itself. I\u2019m a skateboarder,\
  \ so everywhere I go I have my wheels with me. I hardly take the bus because I\u2019\
  d rather save money to buy a drink and of course I\u2019d beat the bus by the time\
  \ i get to the spot I\u2019ve wanted to go too. So it\u2019s like a win win, as\
  \ soon as I start skating there\u2019s nothing really like it. All you do is enhance\
  \ all that\u2019s around you. For an example, trees, animals, and people. I like\
  \ to observe with what they\u2019re doing/how they\u2019re doing it. As well as\
  \ hearing natural sounds, like birds chirping, wind blowing, and people talking.\
  \ I travel at least 14 miles a day on my skateboard, pretty active you can say but\
  \ I like to see it as living my life to it\u2019s finest. When I travel I like to\
  \ take pictures and record little clips of the scenery I see within my eyes. Then\
  \ caption something meaningful to me or too the environment. Most of the time I\u2019\
  m skating around by myself, but when I do I attend to run into someone i know or\
  \ will know. That\u2019s what makes my day splendid and satisfying. No one would\
  \ expect to see me or I wouldn\u2019t expect to see them, it so happens to be that\
  \ way everywhere I go. I enjoy it so much because it makes me feel like I actually\
  \ found something in my life, instead of wondering what to find like most people\
  \ are. I also collect things that I see within a distance, that may seem like trash,\
  \ but with its unique form you can reuse it or literally do anything with your creative\
  \ mind to transform it. That includes people, people may see themselves as trash,\
  \ and like to flip that around to make them rich. I\u2019m not talking about money,\
  \ I\u2019m talking more about feelings. Without feelings we wouldn\u2019t respect\
  \ one another. With feelings we would think at a higher perspective with multiple\
  \ paths that lead you to success."
