Text: "Jogja, one of the beautiful cities on the island of Java in Indonesia. I never\
  \ thought I would really appreciate this city with all the culture and privileges\
  \ it carries. My story starts compilation I decided to take college in Jogja and\
  \ separate from my parents. At first I thought Jogja would be very boring for me\
  \ because the city was just a place to study. However, I thought I was compiled\
  \ into the first semester. I found many cultures that were so extraordinary, which\
  \ only existed in Jogja. Such as historical museums, make batik in the Malioboro\
  \ area, Ramayan Ballet Performances in Prambanan, sekatenan in keraton(a week-long\
  \ Javanese traditional ceremony, festival, fair and night market commemorating Maulid\
  \ (the birthday of prophet Muhammad), celebrated annually started on 5th day through\
  \ the 12th day of (Javanese Calendar) Mulud month (corresponding to Rabi' al-awwal\
  \ in Islamic Calendar), spectacle of the Jamas Keris demonstration,etc. And the\
  \ people of Jogja are friendly and sincere. Like the motto of the city of Jogja\
  \ \"Berhati Nyaman (be comfortable hearted)\".\nJogja's unique sweet and savory\
  \ food menu is my main attraction to always explore traditional Jogja foods such\
  \ as Gudeg (made from young unripe jack fruit (Javanese: gori, Indonesian: nangka\
  \ muda) stewed for several hours with palm sugar, and coconut milk), Sambal Krecek\
  \ (made from the soft inner skin of cattle (cow or water buffalo), however the most\
  \ common recipe today uses readily available rambak or cattle skin crackers), Bakpia\
  \ round-shaped Indonesian Chinese-influenced sweet rolls, usually stuffed with mung\
  \ beans, but have recently come in other fillings as wel), Yangko (made from glutinous\
  \ rice flour. Yangko shaped box with flour, chewy, and taste sweet. In its original\
  \ sense, It contains a mixture of chopped nuts and sugar, like cakes moci Japanese),\
  \ Geplak (a sweet snack made from equal parts coarsely grated coconut and sugar,\
  \ in equal amounts, often colored brightly. Some versions include rice flour, citrus\
  \ leaves and/or waluh fruit), Wingko (a traditional Javanese pancake-like snack\
  \ made from coconut), Oseng-oseng Mercon (Made from koyor or beef fat, this culinary\
  \ is processed with a series of herbs and whole bunch of cayenne pepper. Of course\
  \ it's called a firecracker because of its extraordinary spicy taste) , Cenil (Rolls\
  \ Tapioca Dessert) and other delicious foods.\nBesides those cultural and historic\
  \ tourist attractions, also a row of beautiful beaches always makes me \u201CALWAYS\
  \ MISS\u201D with this city so much. Longing to keep returning and returning. Jogja,\
  \ thank you for making me mature for you. Love the majesty of God to you."
