Text: "I am a pescetarian and a guilty one at that. I had long since given up eating\
  \ meat but hailing from the coastal belt of Kerala in South India, refusing seafood\
  \ was somewhat difficult. So I told myself, I must try and become a vegetarian in\
  \ February, on my birthday. My friends laughed because I chose to spend it at Mauritius.\
  \ On the 8 hour flight via Seychelles, every time I spotted a tiny island surrounded\
  \ by turquoise water, my thoughts conjured up elaborate Creole seafood platters.\
  \ The fact that I had never eaten Mauritian cuisine did not deter my imagination\
  \ from assembling the freshest of ingredients \u2013 coconut, banana leaf, spices\
  \ \u2013 and a tall glass of sugarcane juice to wash it all down. \nMy first impression\
  \ of Mauritius did not disappoint, lush tropical foliage, scalable mountain peaks,\
  \ friendly islanders, majority being fifth-generation Indians, disjointed from the\
  \ land of their ancestors and none (I met) had any friends or family in the sub-continent.\
  \ \nIt was so very Utopian when it came to community living, and I wouldn\u2019\
  t use another word to describe the secular lifestyle of the 1.2-million strong population\
  \ \u2013 a roadside plaque may have said it better: Many people, Many communities,\
  \ all Mauritians. I landed two weeks prior to Shivarathri, the biggest Hindu festival\
  \ celebrated on the Island. It is estimated that each year tens of thousands of\
  \ Mauritians irrespective of their religious belief undertake a padyatra (journey\
  \ by foot) to a holy shrine of Lord Shiva and an adjoining lake called Ganga Talao.\
  \ My taxi driver stopped by to chat with a colleague Hamid Sheik, whose forefathers\
  \ had arrived on the Island from Bangladesh, when British took over in early 1800s.\
  \ I was particularly surprised to learn that Hamid decided to forego a day\u2019\
  s wages by volunteering to help build tents enroute to the pilgrimage. I too had\
  \ undertaken a pilgrimage across India by foot in 2015-16, I told him, walking a\
  \ minimum of 20 kilometers, but he just didn\u2019t understand why someone needed\
  \ to walk 7,500 kilometers to promote national integration. The islanders made communal\
  \ harmony appear so blas\xE9. \nMauritius is hardly 421 years old. The Dutch, French\
  \ used this serene island in the Indian Ocean as a rest and rejuvenation spot, they\
  \ hunted its most famous bird the Dodo out of extinction, which the Islanders are\
  \ still bitter about. I soon understood that this almost-mythical bird was the one\
  \ common history that they shared, because everything since was bastardised to fit\
  \ an evolving template of culture and cuisine, which brings me to the food.\nMy\
  \ hope for an unparalleled gastronomical experience literally went South, when I\
  \ learnt that much of the Island\u2019s big fish was imported from South Africa!\
  \ This piece of information was made known to me as I was chewing a metallic-tasting\
  \ piece of Tuna. \u201CBut that\u2019s how we Creoles love to eat our food Madam,\u201D\
  \ explained a shocked waiter at the Island resort, \u201Cwe braise it slightly on\
  \ the outside but it\u2019s mostly done rare.\u201D No fish in thick coconut gravy\
  \ or steamed in banana leaf, but maybe a bland batter-fry calamari. I was flummoxed\
  \ and so I went to the hotel library and asked around why the Islanders didn\u2019\
  t fish.\nThe British mostly brought people from land-locked areas in North India\
  \ to work in sugarcane plantations. The few men who knew how to fish came from neighbouring\
  \ Madagascar. The Malagasis who practised shore-seine fishing (not venturing out\
  \ into the sea) had the most influence on the island in terms of cooking. But with\
  \ the evolution of a strong unified culture giving rise to the identity of Mauratian\
  \ Creole, old-school traditional cooking technology such as Salazana (brochettes\
  \ over an open fire-pit) have almost entirely disappeared. Mauritian Creole is yet\
  \ to fully develop a standardised orthography and many words associated with archaic\
  \ techniques such as building a damn with seaweeds to catch lagoon fish or harpooning\
  \ have disappeared from the local language. When words disappear, techniques disappear\
  \ and no one in an island nation that provides free education dreams of being a\
  \ fisherman. Needless to say, I turned vegetarian on a tropical island and that\
  \ was the last thing I was expecting to do."
