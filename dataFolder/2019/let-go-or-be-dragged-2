Text: "Remember when you wanted what you currently have? \n-\nThere\u2019s a silence.\
  \ \nThe sound of a heartbeat rips through it. The echoes are intense; their remains\
  \ are lawless, limitless, lucrative. I realize it\u2019s my own as my mom yells\
  \ at my brother and me to stand closer so everything can fit in the photo. But there\u2019\
  s no way, no way to fit all this expansive, prominent, self-aggrandizing show of\
  \ power and knockout beauty that is so overwhelming you can no longer breathe. \n\
  The Grand Canyon is huge and unwilling.  It\u2019ll drown you, suffocate you, strangle\
  \ you, so that there are no combination of words, numbers, gestures to encompass\
  \ it, but either way, you don\u2019t really want to, because deep down this is all\
  \ you ever wanted: to feel something you\u2019ve never felt before, to begin again.\
  \ \n\tWe wake up early. The air is brutally raw, the wind is cold and louder than\
  \ anyone\u2019s voice, my cheeks and nose are numb and red. A forecast of passive\
  \ light rain, coupled with the cold, results in a frigid landscape waiting for us\
  \ and the swamps of other visitors, bleary-eyed and exhausted from the low temperatures\
  \ and high-energy kids. \nOur compulsion and thick layers convince us to hike further\
  \ into the Grand Canyon. Fueled by our continental hotel breakfast and a promised\
  \ expectation of interest, we look for something that supplies us with what everyone\
  \ comes to the Grand Canyon for: a humbling wonder and fascination. The South Kaibab\
  \ Trail leads a portion of itself to Skeleton Point, a steep descent that pledges\
  \ to constantly shock and impress. Skeleton Point is exactly three miles long, one-way,\
  \ from the South Kaibab trailhead and provides its hikers with a subtle history\
  \ told through its streaked sedimentary layers and hard limestone from over 265\
  \ million years ago. \n\tLess than a mile from the trailhead is Ooh Aah Point, a\
  \ tight rest place good for a snack and photos. We indulge. The trees around us\
  \ are loud and looming; the brief sunlight in between the rain peeks through the\
  \ branches and periodically, when it\u2019s particularly nice, there\u2019s a delicate\
  \ rainbow that forces everyone to stop walking. \n\n          Following that is\
  \ a two-mile scraggly path. We quietly pad along in the gradual landscape, irrelevant\
  \ to the overwhelming scenery and emotions that come with the lower altitude, content\
  \ with our minuscule presence. Skeleton Point is just beyond this, and puts the\
  \ scene in widescreen and shows that the Grand Canyon is beyond words. The air feels\
  \ different, the view is unbelievable, and we all bask in the beautiful consequence\
  \ that we embarked on, the adventure that we begged for. We pause, reflect, and\
  \ we confirm that it is incredible. It\u2019s a test of how committed you are to\
  \ yourself and how far you can let yourself go. It\u2019s a feeling that if you\
  \ don\u2019t let go, you\u2019ll get dragged, and here, there are bigger things\
  \ to worry about."
