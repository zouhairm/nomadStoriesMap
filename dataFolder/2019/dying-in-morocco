Text: "If you are dying, die in Morocco. It is the prettiest place to expire from\
  \ the plague, with medinas featuring beautiful brass and cedar house goods, a desert\
  \ with a sharp divide between sand and sky, and seaside cities that wake you with\
  \ the cries of gulls and calls to prayer. However, Imlil, a small town with a twisty\
  \ river beside an equally twisty road, is where Death himself paid me a visit. \n\
  \n\tImlil is a tourist pass-through located in the Toubkal National Park. Supposedly\
  \ some gazillionaire built a house there for a view of the terraces and the mountains.\
  \ I don\u2019t see how he could have found a better view than I had from the hotel.\
  \ It was right next to a river with a small waterfall. The river was attended to\
  \ by a weeping willow with bright green branches. Beyond the waterfall, looming\
  \ over the town and the terraces, were the High Atlas Mountains.  \n\n\tWhen our\
  \ tour group first arrived I was too sick to fully appreciate the sights. Several\
  \ days of being unable to breathe through my nose or hear anything but echoes left\
  \ me short of breath and a little cranky. Any the drugs I ingested only made me\
  \ woozy and dizzy. The Grand Finale, I was certain, was coming. \n\n\tI was not\
  \ the only one in less than perfect health. A fellow tourist, Josie, suffered from\
  \ ankle twisted on a hike to Ait Ben Haddou. Still limping, she was not about to\
  \ shoulder a daypack and hike up another mountain for a night of camping. She offered\
  \ to split the cost of a room with me, which I gratefully accepted. Dying in a comfortable\
  \ bed held more appeal than dying on the side of a mountain. \n\n\tOur tour guide\
  \ was Mohamed, a man of infinite patience who possessed a talent for herding cats.\
  \ He helped Josie up the stairs of our hotel, while I followed, clutching the railing\
  \ and hacking up a lung. Before he left, Josie hugged him. Apparently he wasn\u2019\
  t willing to risk meeting the Grim Reaper, so I only got a high-five. He left to\
  \ go hiking, she settled down to rest her ankle, and I cocooned myself in my bed\
  \ like a cozy, wheezy burrito. \n\n\tI woke up an hour or two later. I still felt\
  \ sick, but at least the medically induced dizziness had gone away. Josie suggested\
  \ we gimp around the town. Every other shop along the main road catered to the tourists\
  \ with hiking gear and fresh orange juice. One guy leant Josie two hiking sticks.\
  \ He wouldn\u2019t rent them to her, but said she could either buy them, or borrow\
  \ them and return them tomorrow. Within five minutes I attracted some local attention\
  \ by gasping for breath and coughing. Nobody wants a cadaver wandering around the\
  \ neighborhood. \n\n\tAfter a dinner of spicy soup, salad, and couscous, Josie and\
  \ I bundled up and made our way to the rooftop. It was there that I stepped out\
  \ of the grave. It was dark and the air smelled so clean. The mountains were invisible\
  \ except for their snow capped peaks. Even from the roof we could hear the river.\
  \ The moon was brighter than the street lamps and there were hundreds of stars.\
  \ The local minaret sounded a call to prayer at the same time a women\u2019s choir\
  \ started singing. That was when I remembered how to breathe, if only to experience\
  \ Imlil at night a little longer. \n\n\tI revived quickly after that night, but\
  \ I\u2019ll always be glad I was sick enough to stay in a hotel. Dying of the plague\
  \ is not a pleasant experience, but hearing prayers accompanied by song echoing\
  \ off the mountains is a beautiful and unexpected memory."
