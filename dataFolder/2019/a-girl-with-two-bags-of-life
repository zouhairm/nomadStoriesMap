Text: "My travel story is a little bit different because this is a story of 4 years\
  \ of my life .I am a girl ,who lives in dreams mostly and travel is my first choice\
  \ but financially I couldn't afford it,so as a backup plan I gave some national\
  \ level exams and selected for course of agriculture in Gujarat.This was the first\
  \ step towards my dream of travel although it was for studies but for me it was\
  \ for discovering some new place, people, culture.In my life ,I have two fears ,one\
  \ is fear of social interaction & relationships and another is fear of exposure.So\
  \ my journey started with leaving my home as a INSECURE STUDENT.I came with two\
  \ bags ,one bag was full of stuffs related to my past and another was full of stuffs\
  \ of present life in search of A NEW BAG  with full of stuffs of satisfaction &\
  \ life.\nNow I am telling you a story of acceptance.Gujarat has a different culture\
  \ as compare to my hometown.life was so simple and colourful, peoples wera soft\
  \ spoken and food was sweet.I took only few days to became a part of this culture.I\
  \ bought a map of Gujarat and pinned my dream destination.sea beaches,local food,trains,\
  \ festivals all were become my daily life routine.My life was like beautiful sunset\
  \ ,means now only I am waiting for moonlight.So all these things continued for initial\
  \ 2 years.Slowy I realized that everything in this world are same mean any type\
  \ of building, sculpture etc were initially sand , people initially just a human\
  \ child with same structure,no language ,no cast,no culture.\nSO I MAKE A THEORY\
  \ OF MY LIFE THAT I AM NOT GONNA BE LIVE HRER (LIFE) FOREVER,I AM HERE FOR A VERY\
  \ SHORT PERIOD EVEN WITHOUT A NOTICE THEY TOOK MY LIFE.This realisation completely\
  \ change my attitude for life.Now for remaining two years ,I was not traveling any\
  \ city ,I was starting feel the city and life of people.l talk with people ,not\
  \ for knowing the culture but for knowing the heart and their thoughts.\nIn the\
  \ last I can happily say that now I have only one bag with full of life and when\
  \ my notice will come ,this bag will not leave me.\U0001F60A"
