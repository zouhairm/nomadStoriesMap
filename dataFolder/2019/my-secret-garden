Text: "After four months in Italy, and after listening to several people insisting\
  \ that I had to go to Verona, I finally gave the plunge. Not that I didn\xB4t want\
  \ to go \u2013 obviously I dreamed about visiting the so-famous city of Romeo and\
  \ Juliet (play that I have read at least three times) \u2013 but I didn\xB4t want\
  \ to go alone, if you know what I mean.\nWhere is the prince charming supposed to\
  \ invite me \u2013 not only that, to insist \u2013 to take me visiting one of the\
  \ world\xB4s most romantic city? That shows love and affection and makes me feel\
  \ special? I don\xB4t know. I didn\xB4t meet him where I live, and neither in Italy.\
  \ Because of that, I resigned to go by myself \u2013 not without trying to boycott\
  \ myself oversleeping and losing the first train.\nI passed through Porta Nuova,\
  \ Basilica di San Zeno Maggiore, Arena di Verona, through Castelvecchio, the bridge\
  \ of Caltelvecchio, the Duomo di Verona. I visited the Piazza Erbe, Piazza dei Signori,\
  \ went up in the tower of Lamberti (the view of the city from the top is worth it)\u2026\
  \ When there was nothing else to do at the surroundings, I gave up. I went to visit\
  \ the famous house of Juliet.\nYou see, I know that nobody knows if Juliet really\
  \ existed, much less if that was the house that inspired Shakespeare. The fact is\
  \ that couples from the entire world go there to stick letters and post-its with\
  \ vows of love for each other, and hang padlocks representing the love that will\
  \ be forever locked in their hearts. What I was supposed to do there? Touch Juliet\xB4\
  s breast and ask for more luck in love? Leave a letter begging for somebody that\
  \ fills me with affection? It was exactly what I did \u2013 excepting the letter\
  \ part, but I mentally recited the desire, at least (more than that would be too\
  \ much humiliation).\nIt was still early, so I decided to cross the \xC1dige river\
  \ to see the view from Castel San Pietro \u2013 and what a view! As it was winter,\
  \ the sun was already setting, and I got thrilled with the view of roofs and towers\
  \ from Verona illuminated by the golden light.  When I was getting down the slope\
  \ to get back from the castle, I saw a sign indicating the Giardino Giusti to the\
  \ left. It was almost time to get my train back to Milan, but I thought I would\
  \ have some more sunny time and didn\xB4t want to waste it. The train I could change,\
  \ anyway.\nThere I was, seeing the garden and making a lot of selfies at the \u201C\
  golden hour\u201D with the green vegetation around me, while near me was just a\
  \ couple, sitting together beneath the statues, she on his lap, kissing each other.\
  \ I decided not to interrupt the scene e went to explore the high parts of the garden,\
  \ when I came across a little tower.\nMore than curious, I opened its door e started\
  \ climbing the narrow spiral staircase to get to the top \u2013 and find out what\
  \ was there. Imagine my surprise when, up there, a little door opened to a small\
  \ hanging garden! I couldn\xB4t believe it. The view up there was beautiful, and\
  \ when I was leaving the tower to the lawn, the sun was setting, giving the sky\
  \ a thrilling orange tone.\nYes, I was alone there \u2013 what was making everything\
  \ more interesting: does everybody that visits Verona go up at that tower and discover\
  \ the garden? \u2013 but coming across that lawn was so unexpected (to me. Maybe\
  \ everybody else knew about its existence, except me. In any case, I don\xB4t want\
  \ to ruin my child fantasy of someone who grew up watching \u201CThe Secret Garden\u201D\
  \ movie), that made up for the lack of a love with me. Moreover, I overflowed love\
  \ for the sunset, the garden, the nature, Verona and Italy. I lost my train latter\
  \ that day, but I still didn\xB4t lose the desire to go back to Italy \u2013 with\
  \ or without someone by my side."
