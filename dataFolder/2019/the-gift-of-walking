Text: "Forget having a purpose, try being aimless.\n\nMany people meticulously plan\
  \ their trips down to the smallest detail -- what clothes to wear, where to go,\
  \ what to eat, how to move around. While planning is important, I tend to disregard\
  \ this entirely when I travel. One of my favourite things to do when I travel is\
  \ to walk around aimlessly, without a destination in mind, accepting whatever experiences\
  \ come my way. Besides being able to pinch pennies by saving on transportation,\
  \ walking enables me to take my time to discover places, slowly processing the environment\
  \ and taking it all in. You might overhear a conversation between the locals in\
  \ a tongue you don\u2019t understand, maybe even see a shopkeeper\u2019s children\
  \ tucked away in the back of a store watching television. These are details that\
  \ would otherwise be undiscovered on any other form of transportation; your travels\
  \ become more personal and connected to the locals. This is the gift of walking:\
  \ to be able to see and experience things that would otherwise be lost. \n\nI picked\
  \ one road, one direction, and headed off all the way on pavements that seemed to\
  \ be rarely used, since everyone\u2019s preferred form of transport was a moped.\
  \ Soon enough, signs in English appeared less frequently (always a good indicator\
  \ that you're out of a touristy area). Under the blazing sun, I made my way through\
  \ stretches of food markets that appeared along the road and came to a halt when\
  \ my eyes caught a glimpse of an entrance to a university. An opportunity!\n\nGoing\
  \ deeper into the school compounds, the only obvious non-local amidst a sea of uniform-donning\
  \ school students, I ended up in the administrative building of Lanna studies. The\
  \ secretary that worked there spotted me. Despite half-expecting to be kicked out\
  \ by her, she kindly gave me a tour of the building and even a brief history lesson\
  \ on the Lanna culture. Continuing on my journey, I thought that had been the highlight\
  \ of my day. \n\nBut it about to get better.\n\nThe pavement I walked on soon disappeared\
  \ into the highway, but before turning back, I walked a little more on the shoulder\
  \ where I stumbled upon yet another entrance. This time, into a park. Looking back\
  \ on what I had yet discovered, it was as if I stepped foot into a gift, unwrapping\
  \ it slowly with each step I took. And so began the unwrapping.\n\nIt was an ordinary\
  \ park. Nothing particularly special, except for the pockets of people dressed to\
  \ the nines in eye-catching, presumably traditional outfits. A few lingered around\
  \ taking pictures of one other, piquing my curiosity. I followed the unsteady stream\
  \ of well-dressed people and began to hear the soft thudding of a bass drum that\
  \ got louder until a massive stage appeared before me -- I had just accidentally\
  \ walked into a major event: the annual New Year\u2019s gathering of the Hmong people.\
  \ \n\nHow do I know that? Well, with not a single tourist in sight, I was approached\
  \ by the only other person in the park not dressed in an elaborate outfit, a half-Thai,\
  \ half-Hmong photographer, who filled me in on what was happening. To say that it\
  \ was surreal would be an understatement. \n\nIt appeared to be a fascinating modern\
  \ day twist on their traditional celebrations. Ladies wore their traditional gowns,\
  \ but accessorised with branded handbags and heels, as well as makeup styles highly\
  \ influenced by that of Japan and Korea. Almost everyone had their phones out taking\
  \ selfies, posing and showing off their traditional dress. \n\nYet, certain traditions\
  \ do remain authentic in spite of technology and modernisation. In neat rows, there\
  \ were pairs of Hmong, of the opposite sex, throwing a ball back and forth in their\
  \ pairs, which continued for a while.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s how they court their partners,\u201D\
  \ the photographer mentioned as we observed a lady lazily throwing a ball back to\
  \ her potential suitor. \n\n\u201CLooks like she\u2019s not very interested in him.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThis event only happens once a year, and I was extremely fortunate to have\
  \ taken a walk in the right direction, at the right time! \n\nSo, care to join me\
  \ on a walk?"
