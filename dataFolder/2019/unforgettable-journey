Text: "Back in the year 2016 I got an opportunity to go abroad for a media internship.\
  \ While I had a list of countries to choose from, I got an opportunity to visit\
  \ the African nation of Egypt. \nAt first I was very nervous coz it was my first\
  \ time when I was on an international flight into a completely different zone. \n\
  My first few days were very awkward as for me everything was new.\nAs the days passed,\
  \ I started taking interest  in the social activities where I met different people\
  \ with different nationalities. \nI hardly got time to explore whole of Egypt but\
  \ places where I have been were worth a visit. \nThe city of Cairo is way more than\
  \ we think and one should definitely try Koshary (an Egyptian dish) which is everyone's\
  \ favourite.\nFirst impression of this country may seem like a desert nation with\
  \ terribly hot summers but believe me it was nothing like that.\nTravel tip- before\
  \ making a visit to this part of the African continent, learn some basic Arabic\
  \ words as Egyptians are very particular about their culture and they expect you\
  \ to communicate in their language. \nIf you have an international student ID then\
  \ you could grab some additional discounts at the places you visit such as museums,or\
  \ eVen while shopping.\nSome of the landmarks from the French colonisation period\
  \ are marked as a protected structures so even if you are a great photographer,\
  \ be double sure as it could also land you in trouble."
