Text: "My bucket list always included visiting Machu Picchu, the lost city of the\
  \ Incas with astounding architecture and ancestral energy that fills every bit of\
  \ the site. I went there on my first ever backpacking trip when I got to visit a\
  \ few countries in South America.\n\nYou can either get to Machu Picchu by bus or\
  \ on foot from Aguas Calientes. My friends and I had decided to go up by bus and\
  \ come down on foot. Since we weren\u2019t the most sporty type of travelers, we\
  \ could save our energy on the way up and save money on the way down.\n\nIt seemed\
  \ like a great idea. After all, what could possibly go wrong?\n\nIt turns out that\
  \ more than one thing. We traveled in the summer - which was great for many of the\
  \ places we visited, but not so much for Machu Picchu. That\u2019s the time when\
  \ the clouds are heavy in the sky, which makes it hard to even see the mountains.\n\
  \nEven though the sun was hiding, the visit made an impact on me - but my great\
  \ adventure wasn\u2019t on Machu Picchu; it happened on the way down.\n\nIt was\
  \ raining when we decided to leave the site and get back to Aguas Calientes. \"\
  I\u2019m not made of sugar and I\u2019ve gotten wet before. It's not a big deal\"\
  , or so I thought. But there were a lot of factors besides the rain that made this\
  \ one of the hardest experiences of my life.\n\nWe were over 2,000 meters above\
  \ sea level and my body wasn\u2019t used to it, so my nose started bleeding. My\
  \ knees were hurting and my feet had so many blisters that it kept me from walking\
  \ any faster (I learned the hard way that if you\u2019re bringing only one pair\
  \ of shoes to your trip, it better be a really comfortable pair).\n\nLet\u2019s\
  \ say no one was in a good mood that day. My friends didn\u2019t wait for me and\
  \ I was having a hard time walking down on my own. But I made some friends on the\
  \ way, a black and a beige stray dog. They were walking in front of me and whenever\
  \ they lost my sight, they would wait for me to reach them to keep walking.\n\n\
  My mind was already bursting with pessimistic thoughts when I realized something.\
  \ As I stepped carefully, attempting to make my way down the steep declines of a\
  \ trail made of stones, all wet and slippery from the rain, it hit me that I didn\u2019\
  t have travel insurance.\n\n\u201CWhat if I slip and break my leg? I\u2019ll probably\
  \ die and no one will know, except for the dogs.\u201D My mind was racing with thoughts\
  \ like that.\n\nIn that moment I realized I was having a panic attack.\n\nWhen I\
  \ arrived at Aguas Calientes, you couldn\u2019t really tell raindrops from tears\
  \ falling down my face. I turned my face up to the sky to assimilate the experience\
  \ and let the rain wash away the old me.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting perception\
  \ we have of low-cost traveling before we actually do it. I planned for what I could,\
  \ but I thought the whole trip would be rainbows and flowers: beautiful landscapes,\
  \ new friends, great food and a lot of culture. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I got to\
  \ experience all of that, but I came to realize that traveling takes flexibility\
  \ and being willing to see life through a new perspective.\n\nUp until that point,\
  \ an experience like that would have been a tragedy for me. But later on, I realized\
  \ how that moment re-shaped my life forever. The despair kept me from seeing anything\
  \ good. But even when my friends had left me, I wasn\u2019t alone; those two dogs\
  \ were sent my way to ease the struggle, but I didn\u2019t take the time to appreciate\
  \ them.\n\nI can't say I had a good time in Machu Picchu. My memories from that\
  \ day aren't pleasant. But after that trip, I realized how important it is to be\
  \ present and live the moment, even the ones that seem difficult. I found within\
  \ me the ability to focus on the silver lining, even on the rainiest days."
