Text: "Following a sudden jungle call I gave myself a ticket to Bali, landing in the\
  \ Island of the Gods\u2019 five days later. \nLittle did I know about the magnificent\
  \ beauty that awaited for me to discover both inland and within. \nI had chosen\
  \ an ashram stay in Ubud for my first nights and that was as much of a plan as I\
  \ intended to have. It was my first time in an ashram, in Bali and in Asia itself,\
  \ had really no clue on what to expect except for a few typical blogg tips I\u2019\
  d come across during the flight layover in Doha. All I knew was I would most definetly\
  \ avoid the party locations and turistic conglomerations.\nMy arrival was a real\
  \ leap into the unknown world of inner peace and bliss in between rice fields and\
  \ palm trees. Schedule included morning chanting and yoga practice plus a delicious\
  \ breakfast; a healthy positive environment made it the perfect setting for self\
  \ exploration.\n My trip turned out to become a journey for the soul. Having spent\
  \ my previous couple months lost in my head, Bali became my world escape and the\
  \ ashram a mind oasis to be found. As soon as I stepped inside my reality as I knew\
  \ it ceased its existence and my findings started to rapidly unfold.\nIt is tremendously\
  \ empowering to discover we have the ability to lead us to a state where nothing\
  \ disturbs us anymore. As much as the island has to offer my focus became committing\
  \ myself to live in the present moment uncovering the misteries of my inside out.\
  \ Sometimes it seems we need to travel to a far away land to end up finding ourselves\
  \ all in one. \nI came to discover that the key to our own personal universe lays\
  \ on dettatchment from our known world. The more we are able to let go of our daily\
  \ grasping the more we soar. The process is in itself intense for as we dig through\
  \ our build-up layers more and more arises to be seen and acknowledged. We learn\
  \ then to be open to all possibilities, to accept with gratitude, to maintain our\
  \ equanimity and to ground ourselves. \nWe develop the understanding that our thoughts\
  \ and emotions are there just as indicators whereas before they confirmed our identities\
  \ allowing this to define us. \nWe begin to recognize the divine in us connected\
  \ to the divine all around us embracing our feeling of completeness on our own.\
  \ The green exhuberance that Bali portays allows it all to sink in faster for every\
  \ view in the island is amazing on its own.\nAs far as I am concerned we are manifestors\
  \ of our reality, we must remind ourselves that the beauty in the world is part\
  \ of us all and that we are able to create the most wonderfull scenarios our imagination\
  \ may foresee, we must embrace and share to multiply these materializations. \n\
  Rediscovering is the intention to be set, exploration the action to convey, patience\
  \ the main ingredient and belief the mayor indicator. Add a splash of trust to this\
  \ equation and you\u2019ll bring Balintensity everywhere you go.\nTraveling has\
  \ this expanding effect on our conciousness, our eyes become wider, our understanding\
  \ seems to take a leap, our fears are tested and our challenges ignite us. Travelling\
  \ to the unknown revives our instincts, tunes in with our forgotten will power and\
  \ excersises our bodies. We give us a time-out creating a bubble where everything\
  \ is allowed to become real. We pause. We meet others and become curious of their\
  \ ways and discoverings, we allow the unknown to behold our daily routine. When\
  \ we come back usually we bring new insights which luckily will bend our reality\
  \ as we know it."
