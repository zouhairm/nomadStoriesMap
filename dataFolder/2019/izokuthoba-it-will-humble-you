Text: "The Comrades Marathon in South Africa is aptly named the Ultimate Human Race.\
  \ But who runs 89 kilometers? \n\nMy curiosity with this majestic race ensured that\
  \ I had an annual 12-hour date with my TV. My curiosity always hovered giddily across\
  \ the dark and almost eerie starting line, ready to devour the stories of the 20\
  \ 000 fearless warriors from all over the world whose dreams were about to be laid\
  \ bare as they put one foot in front of the other. My curiosity eventually quietens\
  \ and marinades in the bellowing sounds of our national anthem and the united crowd\
  \ merrily singing Shosholoza. Then BANG! The gun explodes in the air and the engine\
  \ of my curiosity roars forward to lick every inch of this ultimate human race.\n\
  \nTo my surprise, my curiosity is quickly captured by South African runner Caroline\
  \ Wostmann.  There on my TV screen was a woman who was not a professional athlete,\
  \ but a lecturer at Wits University, a mother of two and a wife. But the commentators\
  \ were saying that she stood a chance of winning Comrades. They also casually mentioned\
  \ that she recently won the Two Oceans Marathon and if she wins Comrades she\u2019\
  ll be the second South African female runner to win both marathons in the same year\
  \ and fourth runner overall to do that. And she won it. Her win teleported me to\
  \ the 2016 starting line as I felt that this protagonist was every woman who wanted\
  \ to run the Comrades. \n\nBut first up, I had to tackle a marathon and run it within\
  \ 5 hours to qualify for Comrades Marathon. Berlin Marathon was my choice as I thought\
  \ to myself; what a spectacular way to debut into marathon running whilst getting\
  \ a chance of sightseeing a city by running 42kms in 5 hours. How many people can\
  \ say that they experienced the main attractions of Berlin such as the Reichstag,\
  \ the Siegess\xE4ule, Berliner Dom, Brandenburg and Potsdamer Platz by running through\
  \ the city? \n\nAs if the adrenaline pumping in my veins was not enough, you had\
  \ crowds dressed in all sorts of German regalia lining up the streets and cheering\
  \ you from the 1st kilometre to the very last. My magical moment came at around\
  \ 35kms where I could feel my legs becoming jelly and mind starting to shut down\
  \ on me. My favourite song in the world is Purple Rain by Prince and what do you\
  \ know? A whole band was playing that song at the 35km mark. I obviously burst into\
  \ tears and got the biggest booster to my system. \n\nI ran those last 7kms with\
  \ such gusto that I qualified with less than 5 seconds remaining on the clock: 04:59:55\
  \ and qualified for Comrades Marathon with my first attempt of running a marathon.\
  \ I'm that girl who makes it no matter the circumstances. And yes, the finish through\
  \ the Brandenburger Gate is a rockstar moment.\n\nI returned to South Africa a shero\
  \ and lined up on the Comrades Marathon starting line, running 89 kms between two\
  \ cities in Durban. On that day, I kept running for more than myself and my travels.\
  \ I kept running for *Pink Drive, I kept running for my dad who lost his battle\
  \ with cancer in 2012, I kept running to fill my life with humility, I kept running\
  \ to show up for my 12-hour date with 19 999 runners, etching our dreams 1km at\
  \ a time. \n\nThe Comrades Marathon is aptly named the Ultimate Human Race. But\
  \ who runs 89 kilometers? Storytellers like me. Next up is the Great Wall of China\
  \ Marathon.\n\n*I ran the Comrades Marathon to raise funds for PinkDrive. PinkDrive\
  \ is a breast cancer Non-Profit Company (NPC), powering South Africa\u2019s mobile\
  \ Women\u2019s Health Mammography and Gynaecology Units. PinkDrive\u2019s underlying\
  \ message is \u2018Early Detection Saves Lives\u2019. All PinkDrive units travel\
  \ to semi-urban and urban areas around South Africa with the aim of enabling all\
  \ medically uninsured access to women\u2019s health services. These services include\
  \ free education on women\u2019s health, free mammograms, free pap smears, free\
  \ clinical examinations and how to do breast self-examinations."
