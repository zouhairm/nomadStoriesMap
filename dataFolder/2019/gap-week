Text: "By that time, I had been living in the US for one year and almost one month.\
  \ It was beginning of August and, although things seemed pretty hard at that moment,\
  \ I had accepted my friend`s invitation to do a road trip to nine cities, eight\
  \ states in total, making a larger stop in Florida, where we would visit Disney\
  \ World and Universal Studios in Orlando. For a girl, that came from a middle-class\
  \ family from Brazil and was working hard to stay in the US and complete the Au\
  \ Pair program with the goal to study as much as possible, some break from it all\
  \ was tempting. I had to say yes.\nThe Au Pair program, for those who don`t know\
  \ what that means, it`s basically a work and study exchange program. You live with\
  \ a host family, take care of their kids \u2013 yes, exactly like a live-in nanny\
  \ \u2013 and get a pocket money weekly \u2013 much less than a live-in nanny would\
  \ get, I must say \u2013and the chance to study in an American college. From all\
  \ the ups and downs, this exchange program can be an amazing experience and teach\
  \ you a lot more about yourself, something that you would never know if you had\
  \ stayed in your home country.\nBut, even though it would be great keeping the focus\
  \ on the exchange topic, let`s go back to the road trip. It was the first one that\
  \ I would do in my entire life. Of course, I had traveled to another state by car,\
  \ but nothing like that. We planned one whole week with a very busy schedule and\
  \ barely any time for sleeping, which would be hard for the drivers, but they would\
  \ take turns and we hoped everything would be okay.\nWith some websites` help, we\
  \ booked our hostels` rooms, looked for what to do in which city, talked with our\
  \ host families about the vacation week and, on August 4th we departure for our\
  \ adventure. Being in a car with a group \u2013 we were in four - for too long can\
  \ be exhausting and difficult. Think like that: we were like four male betta fishes,\
  \ they can`t stay for too long together in the same aquarium without picking a fight.\n\
  Besides all the disagreement, the trip was going as planned. Our first stop was\
  \ in Nashville \u2013 Tennessee, and this city won our hearts. We stayed for just\
  \ one night and one day, but it was enough to have a taste from that amazingly warm\
  \ and welcoming city. After that, we did a quick stop in Memphis, the \u201Crock\
  \ & roll\u201D city.\nNext stop was Hot Springs \u2013 Arkansas, where we did hiking\
  \ that ends up surprising us with a huge church in the middle of the woods, it was\
  \ beautiful, all made by glass and wood. We head straight to New Orleans \u2013\
  \ Louisiana after the hike in Hot Springs. New Orleans showed us a very different\
  \ culture from all the other states that we saw so far. The mix between French,\
  \ African and American cultures resulted in a friendly place and delicious food,\
  \ not to mention the architecture of that place. \nGulfport \u2013 Mississippi,\
  \ and Mobile \u2013 Alabama, were two cities that we spent less time visiting, we\
  \ end up losing more time than what was planned in New Orleans, which cause us a\
  \ delay in our schedule and forced us to move faster to get to Orlando- Florida.\n\
  It was worth it, though. Orlando was like being inside a fantasy. Disney World and\
  \ Universal Studios \u2013 a spotlight to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter themed\
  \ area, that was wordless impressing for a big fan of the book and movie series\
  \ \u2013 was breathtaking and made us cry like kids for being able to realize that\
  \ trip.\nAtlanta \u2013 Georgia, and Raleigh \u2013 North Carolina was our two last\
  \ stops. We didn`t spend much time there either, but it was two very nice places\
  \ to wrap up the road trip that gave us unforgettable memories and experiences.\
  \ Besides all the negative things that happened, which is normal to occur, road\
  \ trips are exciting and bring surprises at all moment."
