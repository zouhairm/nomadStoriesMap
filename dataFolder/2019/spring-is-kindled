Text: "It\u2019s the silence that hits me, that brief moment of silence when the first,\
  \ pale flames start licking the Falla\u2019s base. The sharp crackling of sparks\
  \ can still reach my ears, only muffled, like those snaps you can hear under water.\
  \ Then Gloriana's hand finds mine, breaking the bubble. All the sounds, the laughter,\
  \ the excitement flood back in. No one speaks Spanish anymore, or English, or the\
  \ dozens of other languages that mix around the great, amazing Fallas of the town\
  \ center: those temporary, goliardic, caricature-like sculptures that appear in\
  \ every plaza like fantastic creatures escaped from a dream - or from a pastel coloured\
  \ nightmare. While the river of tourists in celebration flowed towards the perpetual\
  \ fiesta which is the center of Valencia in March, I swam against the current, left\
  \ the monuments and avenues behind me, heading into Gloriana\u2019s neighborhood.\
  \ There they were, low rustic houses with closed wooden shutters, and the deserted\
  \ waterfront in the moonlight. Houses that in summer will be filled with vacationers,\
  \ Latin American music, and the scent of salt and sunscreen. Now, however, the winter\
  \ still haunts them, its cold clings tenaciously to the rough walls and the dusty\
  \ palm trees in the gardens. And all around me, the neighborhood speaks its language,\
  \ the language of those born and raised here, of those who wait eleven months a\
  \ year for the Fallas to arrive. \"Only valenciano is spoken here,\" explains Gloriana.\
  \ The fire now roars, leaps upwards, engulfs the cartoonish body of the Falla, devours\
  \ it\u2019s grinning Cheshire Cat smile. The bonfire is only a few steps away from\
  \ us. Above, the flames graze the high tension cables hanging between the houses.\
  \ Yet no one is afraid. Old women in traditional dresses share smiles, sugared pancakes,\
  \ lemon beer, sangria or even glasses of the formidable \"agua de Valencia\". Little\
  \ kids challenge the heat by throwing candy, tiny firecrackers, and old toys into\
  \ the bonfire. Entire families contemplate the Falla, that impromptu monument they\
  \ designed and built for an entire year. Now, in the middle of the street, under\
  \ smoke-veiled stars, they celebrate its destruction. In an explosion of sparks,\
  \ the papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 and red-hot metal structure collapses on itself, accompanied\
  \ by cheers, wishes, and popular songs. Gloriana has tears in her eyes, but shouts\
  \ \u201COl\xE8\u201D like the others, as if she were watching a flamenco show. Why?\
  \ What drives this people to build a huge, ephemeral, grotesque statue every year,\
  \ only to see it reduced to ashes? Gloriana shrugs: \"Nobody knows for sure. But\
  \ it certainly is a rite of rebirth, a way to burn the winter away \". Midnight\
  \ has long passed, but no one will sleep tonight. Not even us. We will wait for\
  \ the dawn, holding hands as winter dies, devoured by the cruel, radiant flames\
  \ of spring."
