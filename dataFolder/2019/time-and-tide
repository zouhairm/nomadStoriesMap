Text: "Time and Tide\n\nThe Siddhi tribe actually built an impenetrable mud fort along\
  \ coastal Maharashtra? \nWrapping up my small film on this unique tribe sounded\
  \ perfect. \nAt age 25, in the year 2000, I was shooting a  series of films for\
  \ Discovery Channel on some little known facts about India.I was returning from\
  \ Gir Forest, at the heart of Gujarat, known for being a sheltered habitat of the\
  \ Indian Tiger as well as home to this little known tribe.\nThe Abyssinian Siddhi\
  \ tribe is a minuscule ethnic group that traces its origins to the Bantu tribe of\
  \ East Africa. They are said to have been brought to India by the Portuguese as\
  \ slave labour and then established their roots in certain specific regions, the\
  \ interiors of Gir forests being one such area. The fort at Murud Janjira, on an\
  \ oval shaped rock off the coast of the Arabian Ocean, is a testimony to their power\
  \ and architectural genius, which was far ahead of its time.\nOne can only access\
  \ this fort by boat, and since I was with a camera crew from Bombay, I needed a\
  \ host of other bureaucratic permissions as well. My producer, a man not known for\
  \ monetary largess, had already pre-paid for a 6 hour permission to shoot inside\
  \ the fortress and the clock was ticking.\nMy adventure began half way through my\
  \ journey to Murud, along the Bangalore- Mumbai highway, since my camera person\
  \ got suddenly taken unwell, doubling over with a severe stomach ache. With time\
  \ ticking away for travel and our trip ostensibly being mapped out, I found myself\
  \ literally stopping at every little hamlet I could find to enquire if there was\
  \ a doctor who could tend to what I feared might be appendicitis. \n\nFinally, at\
  \ the fifth stop, we were shown to a government doctor who gave an injection that\
  \ would make him drowsy but provide pain relief.\nIt was a blur of activity getting\
  \ to the port and finding our ferry with the agent who had our permission to enter\
  \ and shoot. My challenge was now to wake up a very groggy cameraman and get him\
  \ to shoot external shots of the fort as we approached it from the sea. He was sporting\
  \ enough through his haze of sleep to agree to be pinched every time I felt he was\
  \ falling asleep. We had already lost three hours of shoot time and now had a lot\
  \ to cover before our time ran out. We could not get back to shore during high tide\
  \ and would be stranded at the Fort!\n\nThe extent of power this marine stronghold\
  \ must have exercised is evident from the three of five hundred and seventy two\
  \ canons that still remain. Made from a combination of five metals or 'panchdhatu',\
  \ these canons never got heated so could be fired repeatedly. They had a range of\
  \ twelve kilometers out to sea. A kilometer long underwater tunnel to the nearest\
  \ village was recently sealed by the government.\nThe fort had two major entrances\
  \ flanked with ornate carvings of animals. There was rather a grand three storey\
  \ structure where court was held which is now in ruins.\nIt struck me as ironic\
  \ while the guard was showing us  the 'Darya Darwaza', a doorway which opens into\
  \ the sea and was probably used as an emergency escape that we were looking to do\
  \ precisely that!\nI was relieved to find my cameraman was well on the verge of\
  \ waking up after a three hour black sleep and another 3 hours where he was shooting\
  \ through his sleep- prompted and supervised by me pinching his arm black and blue\
  \ every five minutes.\n\nWe still laugh when we meet and debate where the greatness\
  \ really lay- in the Siddhi tribe building the mud fort or in my getting caught\
  \ by a demonic urgency to finish the shoot at breakneck speed and emerge victorious\
  \ within the time frame, so as not to have to pay for another round of permissions.\
  \ He tells me he has never allowed anyone to pinch him since that day."
