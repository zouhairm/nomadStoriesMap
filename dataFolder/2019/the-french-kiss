Text: "I wiped my tears for the final time as I turned back to look at her. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find this type of love \u2013 an already married love.\n\nIt was first\
  \ of December. France. Lyon exactly. I was in a group of young people who had gone\
  \ to France to find adventure. Not love, at least not for me. But I\u2019ve always\
  \ wondered, what the French kiss would feel/taste like? Somewhere in my hypocrisy,\
  \ I wanted to experience the French kiss! I wanted to be able to brag about it,\
  \ until I\u2019m old and grey. As the others were discussing what to have for dinner,\
  \ I smiled at myself, clicked my tongue and ran a hot one across my lips. I wasn\u2019\
  t looking for love, I said to myself, I was only looking for experience.\nAnd so\
  \ it was, that winter came upon us in France and it was a drunken excitement to\
  \ watch the snowflakes fall. Somedays, it came with a little drizzle, and some other\
  \ days, it appeared the universe was experimenting with the weather. Either ways,\
  \ the snow was exhilarating to watch. At once, I gained my childhood wonder back,\
  \ and for a moment, I forgot about the French kiss. It was at this point that I\
  \ felt a tap on my shoulders and turned to see her:\n\u201CCette route mene t-elle\
  \ au caf\xE9?\u201D She said \n\u201CI\u2019m so sorry, do you speak English?\u201D\
  \ I chuckled helplessly, the snow in my face.\n\u201CArrrhhh sorry,\u201D she laughed\
  \ nervously, \u201CPardon me! I just assume.\u201D She said in heavily accented\
  \ English\n\u201CI\u2019m ask for the caf\xE9 here!\u201D\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\
  \ I\u2019m new here and I don\u2019t really know if there\u2019s a caf\xE9 here\
  \ or not!\u201D I said.\n\u201CArrrhhhhh!\u201D She exclaimed in frustration. \u201C\
  Merci!\u201D\n\u201CYou\u2019re welcome!\u201D I said looking at her resigned face.\
  \ \u201CYou know what, I can help you find it.\u201D\nI got my phone out and asked\
  \ google map for help. Together, we took the short walk to the dimly-lit caf\xE9\
  . She said thank you profusely, sometimes, in words of French that came across as\
  \ expletives. I smiled and turned to leave.\n\u201CPlease stay. Me, you, eat something!\u201D\
  \ She pleaded.\n\u201COooh no, don\u2019t bother about it! It\u2019s really okay,\
  \ really!\u201D I said, for want of what to say.\n\u201CNooo, I want. Please!\u201D\
  \ Her accent and grammar nearly drew out a laugh but instead, I said \u201COkay!\u201D\
  \nI was there for four hours, basically getting interviewed. She asked me about\
  \ everything and begged me to teach her few words of English. By the time we were\
  \ done, it was too late to find my way home. So she asked me to come with her.\n\
  By the time we got to her place, I was already hungry again. I tiptoed my way through\
  \ the heavily parked parlour and slumped into the next chair!\n\u201CYou hungry?\
  \ I cook pasta!\u201D She said. By this time, it was easy to understand her English.\
  \ If I was hungry, she would cook Pasta for me, not that she had already cooked\
  \ pasta.\nI said no. I couldn\u2019t bear to bother her further.\nThen, she came\
  \ and sat in front of me and thanked me again. \nAs I was preparing myself to say\
  \ another round of \u2018Don\u2019t mention\u2019, her mouth covered mine! \nI was\
  \ numb and my fingers suddenly felt heavy! \nIs this even legal? Ooh dear God!\n\
  I surprised myself by kissing her back. We went about it for moments that felt like\
  \ insanity. That night I dreamt about the French kiss from a woman!\nWhen it was\
  \ morning, the cries of the baby woke me up. I opened my eyes to a man sitting on\
  \ the dining table, eating breakfast! Where am I God?\nShe came then, smiling.\n\
  I felt a tug at my heart. This thing that happens when your heart is losing cooperation\
  \ with the rest of your body. \nYes, I had my French kiss on the second day of the\
  \ snow. A French kiss from a French woman who is married with a kid. A French kiss\
  \ from a woman my religion forbids me to love. I didn\u2019t expect to find a strange\
  \ love that was already married!"
