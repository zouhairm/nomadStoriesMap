Text: "I knew I wanted to meet Italy but I never expected it to be this way.\nWhat\
  \ would you say if your daughter comes up to you out of nowhere and tells you that\
  \ she wants to be an Au Pair?, basically travel to a foreign country alone and stay\
  \ with an unknown Italian family... Crazy right? Especially when you\u2019re 18,\
  \ well that\u2019s exactly what my dad said when I told him my plans. The thing\
  \ is that I have Italian ancestry including my grandpa Angel, so I got the permission\
  \ of my family to go to Italy because of that, they said \u201CMaybe this experience\
  \ will be life changing for you\u201D and I was like \u201COk this is not that deep\
  \ I\u2019m just going to Italy for the pasta and the pizza\u201D but I was so wrong\
  \ and they were so right (just to point it out pizza and pasta are the most amazing\
  \ things here).\nMy flight to get to Italy  was the craziest thing, all three of\
  \ them (yes...three) from Miami to Lisbon and then from Lisbon to Rome and then\
  \ wait ten hours for my last flight that was to Genoa, I almost slept 24 hours when\
  \ I finally got home with my Italian family. I remember being so nervous to meet\
  \ them and hoping that they would like me and not kick me out of their house, but\
  \ they are actually the nicest people ever and super funny (and their kids are the\
  \ cutest as well)... but you don\u2019t want me to write about that now (maybe later\
  \ if you choose me to tell you travel stories in Portugal) you want me to write\
  \ about Italy...beautiful, gorgeous Italy, I\u2019m gaining a few kilos here but\
  \ I\u2019m not mad about it at all. \nI\u2019m in Genoa right now, I\u2019ve been\
  \ here for one month and I\u2019m staying till August, I have seen the most wonderful\
  \ things... churches here are fascinating, and the views and sunsets, and the people.\
  \ What drew me to Genoa was the family I met in the website but now that I\u2019\
  m here I know that it was the best decision of my life, I feel like I belong here,\
  \ I even know  the people from my bus stop and greet them every time with \u2018\
  Ciao Ragazzi\u2019, and I have the most beautiful group of friends to explore with.\
  \ \nYesterday one of my friends slapped her boyfriend and broke up with him so all\
  \ of us booked a ticket to Camogli to have lunch and make her feel better and boy\
  \ was I thankful that she broke up with him because that\u2019s what made the perfect\
  \ day happen. We grabbed lunch near the sea, we ate \u2018Pinguino\u2019 that\u2019\
  s a classic ice cream of Camogli, had some drinks while watching the sunset but\
  \ most of all we had so many laughs together it was wonderful. Now Camogli is my\
  \ favorite place in the planet, I have seen a lot of sunsets but the one I saw yesterday\
  \ was speechless, really beautiful. \nI now see photos and videos from myself two\
  \ years ago, even one, and I feel like I\u2019m a different person, it\u2019s crazy\
  \ how much you can change in just one month, especially living in a new country\
  \ with a new family and meeting new friends, I never thought that I would be the\
  \ person that jumps on a plane or a train spontaneously but I\u2019m evolving and\
  \ learning new things, even small stupid things like hanging clothes the right way\
  \ or how to order properly a coffee so you don\u2019t end up with just a small shot\
  \ of espresso. Life is quite unexpecting, I\u2019m here living in Italy and slowly\
  \ discovering this country, I\u2019m a better version of myself, a more mature one\
  \ also and I\u2019m so happy about it, so happy to be alive and to tell this stories\
  \ to my mom, friends from back home or even just random people. If my grandpa Angel\
  \ saw me right now he would be speechless, and I know that I\u2019m making him very\
  \ proud."
