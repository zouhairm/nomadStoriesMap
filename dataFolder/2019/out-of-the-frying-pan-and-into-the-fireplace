Text: "When my guide knocked a stranger out of the way and onto the ground that should\
  \ have been my first clue to turn back. He bellowed for me to keep pace or he would\
  \ leave me. Every commuter in our vicinity backed up as the force field of his foul\
  \ mood projected us through the crowd. \n\nThe scent of meat burning, impaled by\
  \ skewers, coupled with the sheer volume of slippery bodies at rush hour overwhelmed\
  \ me as we twisted through a labyrinth of off-white mini busses in various states\
  \ of disrepair. Their drivers screeched the names of unfamiliar destinations to\
  \ solicit riders while his clammy hand yanked my forearm and my attached body through\
  \ the taxi rank. While my Nigerian immigrant guide Jean-Paul, self named Fortune-for-Life,\
  \ hissed at vendors, passengers and drivers alike, I began to question how far my\
  \ desperation to connect with locals would take me. However, the promise of witnessing\
  \ to the budding afro-beat movement kept dragging me though Cape Town\u2019s CBD.\n\
  \ \nWe ended up in a suburb called Bellville, but not after our driver threatened\
  \ to kick me, Fortune and the sprite he was ferociously slurping through a straw\
  \ out of the mini bus twice. \n\nA couple wrong turns later we ended up in the courtyard\
  \ of a high schooler living at his aunt\u2019s home. Two toddlers scooting around\
  \ on plastic toys saw us and immediately went inside to fetch their cousin while\
  \ we waited next to the tile indenture of a drained swimming pool. Soon Ryan, the\
  \ producer arrived to tell us that since we were an hour late, his next customer\
  \ was already recording.  Upon hearing this, Fortune\u2019s voice began to get loud,\
  \ and Ryan\u2019s eyes darted towards his aunt\u2019s house. Eventually, he quietly\
  \ agreed to let us in. He led us past the kitchen through a makeshift bedroom sequestered\
  \ by sheets and directly into the fireplace in which Fortune would be recording.\
  \ It had the best acoustics. After looking Fortune up and down the other artist\
  \ accepted the fact he would have to wait and Ryan muttered a feeble apology. \n\
  \nThe beat bought from a Nigerian friend had the quality of static as it traveled\
  \ from Fortune\u2019s phone through an auxiliary cord and into speakers. It is then\
  \ that Fortune began to rap his lyrics in the brick studio. \n\nAs an immigrant,\
  \ making music was not Fortune\u2019s first choice of profession, and it showed.\
  \ His lyrics were shallow and did not translate well to English. Rapping was just\
  \ one of the many entrepreneurial and under the table jobs he had procured in his\
  \ time in South Africa. The list also included bartender, masseuse, and club promoter.\
  \ Just like in my country, rapping is seen as a way out of financial distress. But\
  \ his life was less than glamorous as he sought to earn a living wage and the stress\
  \ was obvious. \n\nUpon leaving Ryan mentioned the possibility of hosting a concert\
  \ with Fortune for extra money. When it came time to pay for the session, Fortune\
  \ explained that he spent all his rand the previous night. Both turned to me expectantly."
