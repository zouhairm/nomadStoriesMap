Text: "I bounded onto the train as quickly as the swarming throngs around me would\
  \ allow. Glancing around at the interior, teeming with people, I conveyed to my\
  \ traveling party that the six of us would need to divide and conquer if we wanted\
  \ to sit for the 40 minute ride back to London. I walked, scanning the aisle until\
  \ I noticed an empty seat next to a man working industriously on a laptop. Catching\
  \ my glance, he motioned for me to sit. I did so gratefully and, laying my heavy\
  \ backpack at my feet, I settled in.\n\tAs we pulled away from the Windsor and Eton\
  \ Central Station, I took advantage of the momentary solitude to bask in my pictures\
  \ and recall the leisurely day spent exploring the great Windsor Castle and the\
  \ bustling village surrounding it. I was flooded again with the near-sensory overload\
  \ I had experienced throughout the day. Red-coated guards in tall hats had marched\
  \ through the castle gate leading us all in procession onto the stately grounds,\
  \ heavily trod but still housing an air of majesty and importance. Beautifully unfamiliar\
  \ carvings had looked down on us from above each ancient door as we entered the\
  \ stately chapel and dignified castle halls. \n\t I was pulled from my recollection\
  \ of our marvelous day by the offering of a mint from my seat companion. Over the\
  \ past week of travel, I had learned that this was a common act of friendly courtesy\
  \ amongst the English. I had also learned through the course of my life, that one\
  \ never refuses a breath mint when it is offered, just in case.\n\t\"Is it difficult\
  \ to do your work on the train?\" I inquired as I accepted his token of neighborliness.\
  \ \n\t\"Can be a bit,\" he replied \"but better to get some'it done here, so as\
  \ not to have so much once I'm back home, right?\"\n\tI smiled in agreement, thanked\
  \ him for the mint, and deterred him from his busy typing no longer. It was at this\
  \ comment that my mind shifted from my musing, and I looked more intently around\
  \ the crowded train. There were a great many passengers doing work on computers\
  \ the same as my seat-mate, and they all seemed as fixed on their own as was he\
  \ upon his. One young man about my own age wearing a University College London sweatshirt\
  \ made feverish notes in a notebook opened over an English anthology. Directly across\
  \ from us, a mother rested her eyes as her children squirmed in a shared seat beside\
  \ her. Up the aisle an elderly woman was telling someone on her cell phone that\
  \ they were \"a bit late getting back, but would be around in time for dinner after\
  \ all,\" while her cohort checked his watch for what I assumed was not the first\
  \ (or last) time that afternoon.\n\tI was struck with realization that I was amongst\
  \ real people. Of course I had known this all along, but it had not really occurred\
  \ to me that I was traveling with these people on their commute. What was part of\
  \ the grand adventure to me was to these gathered here with me merely another trip\
  \ home or to work or school. Here among the ancient stones of castles, riding rails\
  \ laid by industrial pioneers towards a two thousand year old city, people were\
  \ living their everyday lives. Through my eyes, these people had been the important\
  \ but interchangeable background characters as I wended my way through an age-old\
  \ land. But to each of them, I was a face passing by as they went about their daily\
  \ business. Perhaps this man next to me would return home to tell his family how\
  \ he encountered an American today. What an exciting recognition, to be the stranger\
  \ that other people may carry stories of in their own memories.\n\tAs the train\
  \ halted at Paddington Station, I nodded farewell to this working man and, minding\
  \ the gap, stepped onto the platform. As my companions and I reunited and continued\
  \ onto the next chapter of our adventure, I found that I could not help but wonder\
  \ what tiny, personal adventure each person brushing by might be on themselves."
