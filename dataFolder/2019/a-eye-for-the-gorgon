Text: "Istanbul. Underground in the Basilica Cistern; A Byzantine water container\
  \ that supplied the Great Palace with fresh water fifteen-hundred-odd years ago\
  \ also supplies this writer with a little claustrophobic thrill reminiscent of Indiana\
  \ Jones (the Dyke version). Sweating heart-beats bullets at the doorway to the decent,\
  \ I take a breath and plunge like a high-board diver in a children's pool. I was\
  \ seeking Medusa in all her dust-making glory. \n\nUnderground is not my thing.\
  \ I could explain it away with some imagined past-life trauma of being buried alive\
  \ in an Egyptian crypt \u2013 but I know that I am just a chicken.  Beneath the\
  \ surface, hundreds of recycled marble columns support the roof of the cistern and\
  \ you can spy these popping up out of the ground all around the city like the shingle-back\
  \ of a diving dragon luring you to it\u2019s lair. For some people a visit to a\
  \ cathedral elicits emotions of worship, but for me it was this; a moment of real-time\
  \ time-travel. The rather shallow water is filled with the fattest carp you will\
  \ see and it is pleasantly cool down there. They (presumably the tourist board)\
  \ have erected concrete walkways to keep your feet dry but imagine being the first\
  \ people to find this after many years of sinister slumber? Imagine how weird it\
  \ would have been to plonk through that water and then find Medusa staring at you\
  \ from dead eyes where she has waited for centuries to connect with your gaze. \n\
  \nThe cistern has the most wonderful acoustics (and it is used sometimes for musical\
  \ events). As we wandered through it, the voices off the other people where distorted\
  \ into light, spooky hauntings that bounced around the walls and ceiling and followed\
  \ us as we roamed. For the most part, the smell was pleasant, just a slight mustiness\
  \ but as we neared the far corner where Medusa lurked, a foul stench hit. There\
  \ are two Medusa heads (Medusi?) one is upside down and the other on her side -\
  \ she is used as the base for two towering marble columns. No one really knows why\
  \ they are placed like this. The best guess is that it is to negate the power of\
  \ the Gorgon\u2019s gaze - the dullards however believe it was merely to make the\
  \ bases fit properly under the columns but let us not be the kill joys okay? \n\n\
  'Hens eyes' with tears are the other mysterious column type. The tears suggest a\
  \ tribute to the hundreds of slaves who died making the Cistern. There is a hole\
  \ in one of these columns which tourist have taken to having their picture taken\
  \ with their finger\u2026. it\u2019s too awkward to watch. Let's return to the Gorgon's\
  \ gaze."
