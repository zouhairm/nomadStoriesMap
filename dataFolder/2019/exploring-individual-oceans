Text: "20,February , 2019 I meet a person on airport -stranger - who is going to the\
  \ same event as I am. I land to Delhi now i encounter 10 strangers going to the\
  \ same event. We reach the bus stop and there is an entire bus of people I explore\
  \ towards the same destiny. \n20,February , 2019 4:00 Pm 150 stranger people or\
  \ I must say creators , explorers , artist \n3 days 150 people 30 mentors 1 destination.\
  \ I got to explore a whole new ocean in each one of them diverse perspectives common\
  \ desire. Some want to open startup\u2019s some want to help other creators some\
  \ want to invest some want to provide platform for those underprivileged people\
  \ who cannot access to bigger opportunities. I met humans who decided their own\
  \ self who chose to be women against the natural appearance of a men who embrace\
  \ this universe by creating a community of their people who explore art and paint\
  \ the walls pathways and cooperate walls. I came across those people who chose to\
  \ create something that the society oppressed on them they chose to fight they chose\
  \ to ignore they chose to live the way they want to live. \nFor me it was a chaos\
  \ as I was confused myself on what I wanted to do in life but seeing these 150 beautiful\
  \ souls made me realise I was just 20 I don\u2019t have to worry about giving of\
  \ iin life I don\u2019t have to worry about those people who stop me from doing\
  \ what I want I don\u2019t have to worry on how I won\u2019t be able to achieve\
  \ my dreams am just 20 I have a long life ahead I realised I can start small I can\
  \ explore small n lead to bigger changes. Difference between a music festival and\
  \ a creators fest is even the normal conversation starts with innovation creation\
  \ and ideas people around you talk to you about how one can achieve what they urge\
  \ to persue in life. I met singers writers musicians with vast knowledge and aspects\
  \ to life I learned how people choose different means to bring their raw emotions\
  \ and feelings out. I believe one can always learn a lot by travelling one can find\
  \ what they want by travelling"
