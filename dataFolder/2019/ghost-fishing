Text: "Marine conservationists know a chilling fact; our oceans are haunted. Ghost\
  \ nets, as they are known, are stray fishing nets, mostly left behind unintentionally\
  \ by fishermen. The nets continue their work long after they are lost, lasting in\
  \ the ocean for up to 600 years. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s a fishing net! It\u2019s wrapped\
  \ around the propeller!\u201D\n\nPatrik, our skipper and my Czech boyfriend gasped\
  \ in a shivering stutter, pulling himself back into sailing yacht Coriandre\u2019\
  s cockpit, using his tattooed right arm for leverage out of the chilling waters\
  \ of the English Channel. He attempted the engines start button again. The sun disappeared\
  \ into the ruler-straight horizon, and the sky turned gravestone grey.\n\nThe English\
  \ Channel, smallest shallow sea in continental Europe, is home to the busiest shipping\
  \ lanes in the world. A gruesome battle ground, a motorway with a rush hour that\
  \ lasts all twenty-four of them, and underneath, a museum of non-victorious nautical\
  \ voyages. I was sincerely hoping that Coriandre would refrain from becoming a new\
  \ exhibition piece for the latter.\n\n\u201CThe engines dead. We\u2019ll have to\
  \ wait for wind.\u201D Patrik\u2019s blue eyes were now fixed toward the bow.\n\n\
  Two miles to starboard, ships as tall as twenty story apartment buildings drew near,\
  \ aligned one behind the other like battle ships on the attack. Panic entered my\
  \ body, inviting the pores of my hands to create small swimming pools of sweat on\
  \ their surfaces. \n\nWith no wind nor working engine, Coriandre bobbed on the water\u2019\
  s surface like freshly made jelly, drifting closer to the Channels H20 version of\
  \ the M25. As Patrik calmly radioed the English coastguard, I fantasized headlines\
  \ of tomorrows newspapers in my mind, visualising my mother cursing my wretched\
  \ sea-dog boyfriends name.\n\n\u201CSailor couple perish as cargo ship cuts boat\
  \ into 50 pieces,\u201D it would read.\n\nI exploded, \u201CWIND!\u201D, feeling\
  \ a minute movement of air on my right cheek.\n\nAs though the boats lines were\
  \ an extension of his arms, Patrik hoisted the front sail with haste. Coriandre\
  \ slowly sailed to port, and eventually away from the unapologetic urgency of the\
  \ cargo ships course. \n\n\u201CThis wind will take us back to France. We won\u2019\
  t make it to Brighton now.\u201D \n\nThere had been an air of romanticism around\
  \ entering my own country by boat, but safety was paramount. \n\nThe Channels aesthetic\
  \ was now of a struggling artists canvas, who could only afford black. Our head\
  \ torches were our only saviour from darkness, allowing us to track the compass\
  \ on the port side of the hatch. Lights from other boats and buoys, stars above\
  \ and plankton in the water created a 360-degree planetarium. \n\nDespite the oceans\
  \ magic, I could not stop thinking about what had just happened to us.\n\n\u201C\
  If it had caught a dolphin, it wouldn\u2019t have survived, right?\u201D\n\nMy question\
  \ warranted no response.\n\nWhen small fish become trapped in ghost nets, larger\
  \ sea life are attracted towards them. As the weight of the catch increases, the\
  \ net will sink. Once the captives decompose, the net will rise again to take its\
  \ next victims. This is known as ghost fishing.\n\nTwelve hours after the net found\
  \ us, my feet met land at long last, every inch of my salt encrusted sailing shoes\
  \ touching the bobbing pontoon at Le Havre marina as though a magnet was placed\
  \ under them. Patrik stepped next to me with the same enthusiasm, his blonde spikey\
  \ hair soaked and his eyes sunken like coins in wishing fountains. We called a local\
  \ diver on approach, and a man in his 30\u2019s, head to toe in his skin tight black\
  \ uniform, greeted us with a polite wave, pulling down his mask and getting straight\
  \ to work.\n\n\u201CYou were very lucky,\u201D the diver said, handing us the tangled\
  \ green plastic mesh after a thirty-minute battle, drenched in murky marina water.\n\
  \nHe glanced at the Channel, searching for his English, his brown eyes showing concern.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThey always talk about straws, cups, plastic\u2026,\u201D he finds it,\
  \ \u201Cbags. But this is big problem too. They say its biggest killer in ocean\
  \ now, these fishing nets. Not the first this happened to. Not the last I think.\u201D\
  \ \n\nNo language was necessary for us to mutually acknowledge; it was time for\
  \ change."
