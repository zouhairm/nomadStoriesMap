Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re not thinking of taking a balloon flight are you?\u201D, the\
  \ Travel Doctor had asked as she checked our vaccination records. \u201CDon\u2019\
  t be tempted\u201D, she added.  It was this warning that played out in my head as\
  \ I contemplated a flight over one of the most beautiful spectacles I would ever\
  \ see \u2013 3000 temples and stupas in Bagan, Myanmar.\n\nAlways the adventurer,\
  \ I was not a careless grandmother on a thrill-seeker ride of a lifetime.  Mine\
  \ was a measured caution but the strong attraction pulled at me.  \n\nI checked\
  \ with the flight agent who boarded our replica teak river boat on the Irrawaddy,\
  \ and was assured that the owner of the business was an Australian (he would be\
  \ used to high safety standards) and the flight crew was trained and licensed to\
  \ International standards.  Only the ground crew was Burmese.\n\nI was relieved\
  \ and reassured in unbalanced measure.  Feeling only excitement and a keen sense\
  \ of adventure on my first ever balloon flight, I boarded the ancient, sluggish\
  \ bus that noisily pulled alongside our boat in the dark early next morning.  If\
  \ this transport was a measure of reassurance to nervous passengers, it was well\
  \ short of the mark.\n\nWe reached the field where the balloons stretched out on\
  \ the ground like old wet socks, immobile and spent.  I was intrigued about how\
  \ they would be inflated.  Then a loud, repetitious roar as the gas heaters, one\
  \ by one, leapt to life and the balloons gently began to inflate, rising above the\
  \ ground like huge deep-breathing giants, while tethered to the ancient buses so\
  \ they wouldn\u2019t float away to some unplanned destination.\n\n\nPassengers chatted\
  \ in excited nervousness while the balloons grew ever bigger and higher and more\
  \ impressive as their colours were exposed.  It was still dark and cool, and the\
  \ friendly Burmese ran about rearranging the balloons on the ground, ensuring they\
  \ weren\u2019t twisted, or caught up in any way.  I readied my camera and removed\
  \ the lens cap.\n\n\u201CTime to board\u201D, we heard our English pilot call. \
  \ With the help of a small brown hand, I clambered on board, into the divided basket\
  \ that held eight people in separate compartments. I straightened my wind-proof\
  \ jacket and looked around.  The space felt very small.\n\nSlowly and gently, like\
  \ a ballet dancer, we left the ground with the gas jets roaring more altitude into\
  \ the flight, the pilot smiling at our anticipation.  The sun was just breaking\
  \ the horizon and the golden light illuminated temple after temple, their spires\
  \ protruding through the haze, for miles and long minutes across this magic land.\
  \ Some were comparatively small and centred in dry rice paddies; others were majestic,\
  \ stuccoed and decorated in relief, glowing in the rising golden sun to create a\
  \ spectacle beyond expectations.  Sadly, the only gold on these temples was from\
  \ the sun but I imagined the visual splendour as though they were covered in thick\
  \ gold like other temples and stupas in other areas. \n\nVisitors milled around\
  \ some temples; moving specs crossed fields, climbed steps and entered the temples\
  \ in great reverence to worship Budda.  Suddenly I had the urge to follow them in\
  \ there, to explore and be in awe in these ancient monuments, their ornate murals\
  \ and friezes, some of which had survived for almost a thousand years in this earthquake-prone\
  \ area.   \n\nThe silent reverie endured, broken occasionally by the roar that kept\
  \ us at the correct altitude, as we travelled across this newly-awakened land of\
  \ magical spires of well-tended and neglected places of worship.  At times I felt\
  \ I could reach out and touch these beautiful monoliths and I wanted this fantasy\
  \ to last forever.\n\nWe crossed the great snaking Irrawaddy river, its muddy waters\
  \ hiding another rarity: the pink dolphin.  We would travel many more miles on Kipling\u2019\
  s \u201CRoad to Mandalay\u201D, going ashore to explore another village, temple\
  \ or special teak bridge, observing women cheerfully and chattily laundering the\
  \ family clothes at its edges while men tended the vegetable gardens that grew along\
  \ the land where receding floodwaters deposited new silt.  \n\nThen safely on the\
  \ other side, our first indication of a feather-soft landing was a brown face appearing\
  \ outside the basket.  We had arrived."
