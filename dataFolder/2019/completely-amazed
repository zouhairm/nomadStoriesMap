Text: "This is story about my trip in Dieng plateau Wonosobo which is known as the\
  \ land of the gods. There are so many beautiful places that I already visited such\
  \ as Sikidang crater, Sileri crater, Arjuno temple, Sikunir hills, Jalatundo well,\
  \ Dieng plateau theater, Semar cave and many others. Even the view along the way\
  \ was really beautiful. So green with the clear river and cool breeze air. But for\
  \ me the most memorable one is Menjer lake. Let me tell you why.\nActually Menjer\
  \ lake is the last place that I visited because until the last day I still uncertain\
  \ I will go or not. There are several reasons likes: limited information about the\
  \ destination, Menjer lake has the the farthest distance from another destination\
  \ and come on I already seen so many beautiful places and it's only lake. It is\
  \ worth it or not if I go, compared with the effort that must be taken and of course\
  \ I must estimated the time that will be needed because I must catch up my bus for\
  \ going home. Just information the bus has limited operational time. \nAfter deep\
  \ thinking I decided to still going because I don't want to regret it. As expected\
  \ it's not an easy journey it takes a long way. My guide are only google map, locals\
  \ and faith in my heart. This is very adventurous journey.The road are very quiet\
  \ and spooky, only few vehicle that passed by. The road is also twisty with so many\
  \ sloping descend and sloping slanting upward. I using matic motorcycle. The motorcycle\
  \ freely going down at a speed 60 km/hour even though I used maximum brake. It\u2019\
  s very dangerous because on the left and right there are threatening cliffs. Actually\
  \ in the middle of journey I have thought of retreat. I\u2019m feeling tired and\
  \ worried but my curiousity more bigger and thus give me more strength to keep trying.\n\
  After about one half an hour struggling, finally I found the one that I looking\
  \ for. After a little walk I see a wonderful scenery. You know what the first thing\
  \ that crossing in my mind, this is it, this is the paradise. I can see the Menjer\
  \ lake that very picturesque. The lake is surrounded by greeny hills. It\u2019s\
  \ green because the hills was covered by grass and so many trees. The trees have\
  \ various shape likes round, triangle like pine tree, short and tall. Behind the\
  \ hill there are blue mountains range and the most epic are there were several waterfall\
  \ on the sidelines of the hill. The sound of the water it\u2019s so soothing. The\
  \ unity of lake, green hills, blue mountains and clear sky making a perfect harmony.\
  \ It\u2019s pleasure for your eyes, ears, body and mind.\nNot only sigthseeing I\
  \ also rent a raft from the local. Fortunately he give me fifty percent discount\
  \ just because I\u2019m the first customer on that day. I rent a raft to enjoy the\
  \ scenery more closely by circling the lake. While enjoying the beautiful creature\
  \ I feel very grateful. I\u2019m very grateful that I get this oportunity in my\
  \ life. Grateful because I\u2019m not surrender and keep going untill I found the\
  \ magical lake. The beauty of Menjer lake was very memorable for me. Even though\
  \ I experienced this a year ago I still remember all the detail, all the feeling.\
  \ I fell very happy."
