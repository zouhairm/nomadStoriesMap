Text: "\u201CTell your American friend, I want a gori mem.\u201D  Pyarelal Singh,\
  \ about 55, had made his requirement for a white wife known rather matter-of-factly.\
  \ \u201CHe can shortlist about 50 women and I\u2019ll choose one.\u201D\n\nPyarelal\
  \ and the group of men sitting around him in the dusty, open grounds of Pushkar,\
  \ enduring the cold November winds from the Aravalli mountains of Rajasthan, are\
  \ camel traders. They have travelled about 250 kilometers from Palana village by\
  \ foot, ambling along for days with their \u2018wares\u2019 for the annual Pushkar\
  \ Camel Fair. My friend Nick and I were out at dawn for a walk through the vast\
  \ fair grounds where hardy traders in vibrantly coloured turbans arrive from various\
  \ parts of West India and make temporary settlements; Clusters of makeshift tents\
  \ for their 10-day stay and flocks of camels marking their respective territories.\
  \ Pyarelal\u2019s caravan hailed us over for tea and we gladly accepted in the biting\
  \ cold that winter morning.\n\nAppearing to be the chief of the huddle, Pyarelal\
  \ looks around to see if the effect of his statement has reached his men. When I\
  \ inform him that Nick is British, not American, he nods the Indian nod, uncaring\
  \ of the difference.\n\nI convey the proposal to Nick in English. \n\nNick\u2019\
  s expression is fuzzy behind the vapours wafting over his face from the tea in his\
  \ hands. All eyes have turned on him. \u201CTell him it doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201D\
  \ When I do in Hindi, Pyarelal straightens up and says, \u201CHe can name his price!\
  \ I am rich.\u201D\n\nIt dawns on me that Pyarelal is not joking about the wife.\
  \ Or the money. \n\nCouples fall in love and take time to figure if they want to\
  \ spend the rest of their lives together in the west, Nick explains. Pyarelal is\
  \ quick to make plans to spend a year abroad with his chosen lady. \u201CBut eventually,\
  \ she has to come to my village with me, walking by my side, where everyone can\
  \ see her.\u201D\n\nIn a country where dark skin is a social disadvantage, white\
  \ wives even in modern, urban societies elicit admiring glances and stir envy. In\
  \ a remote Rajasthani village like Palana, it\u2019ll be a conquest story that will\
  \ last generations.\n\n\u201CAnd, don\u2019t worry about my other two wives. They\u2019\
  ll be at her beck and call.\u201D A spirited discussion ensues over the profiling\
  \ of the girl, the remuneration, the follow-up procedure, mostly amongst the Palana\
  \ men themselves. We are allowed to leave only after they have our phone numbers\
  \ and our promise.\n\nTranslating for both sides, not just the language, but the\
  \ way of life, I come to be sitting on the median of two polarised worlds. I could\
  \ comprehend both cultures, even though quite literally east and west. Sitting here,\
  \ far from my city life, I could also comprehend that I was a paltry, privileged\
  \ percent of Indian women who could choose a culture of her liking and be on the\
  \ favourable side of gender equality. \n\nNick and I had wandered the grounds a\
  \ few times past camels with endearing lady names, decorated in feminine beads,\
  \ colourful tassles, mirrorwork and tinkling anklets, in the hope of catching a\
  \ trade in progress. This morning, we probably did."
