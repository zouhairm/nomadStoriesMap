Text: "Tuscan scorpions make nests of our suitcases. I trap one under a glass as it\
  \ skitters across the sea-green tile of the bathroom amid writhing tumbleweeds of\
  \ hair, and smash it with a copy of Dante\u2019s Inferno. Gnocchi burns in the pan.\
  \ Scrape away the mush with a spatula, go out for arancini. Laundry strung from\
  \ balconies, alleys reeking of snuffed cigarettes. Dodge swerving Vespas, a juggling\
  \ unicyclist. Cut through a garden brimming with cypress and umbrella pines. Flea-bitten\
  \ stray cats swarm the steps of Torre Argentina, where Julius Caesar was killed.\
  \ Late afternoon swollen with sun. I am swallowed up in it. \n\nYou don\u2019t expect\
  \ to be unhappy in your fantasies. You never think about having to fake a Canadian\
  \ accent to avoid being asked about Donald Trump. You drink too much wine, and your\
  \ body mushrooms several pants sizes. You are taking up too much room. Your American-ness\
  \ obvious no matter how hard you try to smother it. It\u2019s in the way you walk,\
  \ in your secondhand, baggy clothes and the way you feel inferior in this strange\
  \ world. It\u2019s in the way you stumble through a language you only half understand,\
  \ botching social customs and feeling the heat of embarrassment spread like poison\
  \ across your cheeks. Small victories: figuring out the subway, or the baffling\
  \ ritual of espresso-drinking. \n\nI meet Josh in my Roman Art History class. Tortoiseshell\
  \ glasses, Warhol turtleneck, over-sized camel coat. On mandatory museum trips,\
  \ surrounded by Michelangelo\u2019s angelic murals and marble sculptures of Greek\
  \ mythology, I stare at the back of this boy\u2019s neck, entranced. Have you ever\
  \ felt so lonely that you feel the craving for physical contact thrashing around\
  \ your stomach, poking at your skin like barbed wire? I beat down the urge to rest\
  \ my head against a stranger\u2019s shoulder. \n\nThe first time we sleep together,\
  \ it\u2019s two weeks before the program ends and I\u2019m meant to fly back to\
  \ Philly in time for Christmas. Fingers move like blind earthworms through moss.\
  \ Eyes the color of sage honey. Nerving yourself, reluctant swimmer at the pool\u2019\
  s edge, breath held before the dive. Vulnerability in your laughter. Leave the window\
  \ open in December. Falling asleep, cradled, he murmurs, \u201CHappy birthday,\u201D\
  \ because it\u2019s my twentieth birthday, and nothing about it feels like reality.\
  \ After sex lingers this temporary haze of safety and content. Drowsy and naked,\
  \ flooded with oxytocin, you can\u2019t help whispering into the sweat-dampened\
  \ pillow all of your fears, hurts, and dreams. \n\nIn two months\u2019 time we\u2019\
  ll end up in a screaming match, standing in the rain-slick street on the corner\
  \ of 22nd and Chestnut. I unravel like thread from a spool, your voice is needled,\
  \ stinging. And you realize you didn\u2019t fall in love in Rome, you were simply\
  \ occupying a different identity, cocooned in the false security that accompanies\
  \ living in a new place. And you become a relic of another time, another memory\
  \ glossed with time. I didn\u2019t fall in love in Rome, I fell in love with Rome,\
  \ the city of romance, the city illusion."
