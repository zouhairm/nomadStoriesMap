Text: "I have spent my entire life in a small town in the middle of a trades province.\
  \ It was cramped and suffocating in size and atmosphere and close-mindedness. I\
  \ dreamed of freedom and space and figured a big city would be the best place to\
  \ find it. So when I first touched down in Vancouver, I was surprised to find how\
  \ enclosed it really was. The sky train was filled to the brim with people travelling\
  \ together without going in the same direction, the streets lined with shops that\
  \ cater to the needs of residents while also enticing tourists to peruse the shelves\
  \ filled with their livelihood. \n\nIn fact, you could always tell who was native\
  \ to the land and who was only borrowing the title. The real Vancouverites, the\
  \ ones that adored their city and everything it stood for, would speak to the homeless\
  \ man outside of Joe\u2019s Grill in Davie Village who had three dogs to call his\
  \ own, while tourists would divert their eyes and pretend to not see the perfectly\
  \ content man who managed to find home without ever stepping foot in a house. \n\
  \nOften, actually, I found the homeless were grossly mislabeled- each one had their\
  \ own place, their own corner. They never needed a place of wood or brick or stone,\
  \ the city itself had become their home, and every lost soul wandering the street\
  \ were their brothers and sisters, every stray welcomed in the warm embrace of their\
  \ little blankets for the night. As someone who grew up in a place where everyone\
  \ had a room and a kitchen and a bathroom to call their own, I had never experienced\
  \ such a community so outside of the social normalities accepted so graciously.\
  \ \n\nAs I flew back over the city, the lights flickering like stars as if the vast\
  \ freedom of the sky was actually beneath me, I thought about each person living\
  \ their own life, their own path, and desperately wished every place would offer\
  \ such freedom in such a small way. I found that in between the workers and tourists,\
  \ the trendy cafes and homestyle diners, the souvenir shops in Gastown and the fresh\
  \ produce of the Granville Island Market, I could breathe fresher air than I ever\
  \ could in my small town."
