  \ it\u2026isn\u2019t that what the Zen teachers say? My trip to the Jinja Nile River\
  \ festival was anything but Zen at the start. The free car I thought I\u2019d travel\
  \ in turned out to be full, so I unpacked my bag. But then at the last minute, I\
  \ learned that married friends were also going and they had a lot of space. I repacked\
  \ the bag and we were off. Because they had a baby on board, we drove at a scene\
  \ soaking speed to the East of the country. \n\nBefore going to the festival, my\
  \ friends had to drop their luggage at their accommodation. A place called Saranac.\
  \ I had never been. They had offered me the spare room but I was meant to be camping\
  \ with the first group so I declined. Plus, I didn\u2019t want to impose on private\
  \ family time. \n\nSaranac is a little ways off the main road. The small mud houses,\
  \ children riding Hero bicycles and wide food plantations made it seem like we were\
  \ much further from Kampala. The road to was tight enough that when a car came from\
  \ the opposite direction, there was some manoeuvring back and forth so both could\
  \ fit without squashing any pineapples in the large garden to the left. \n\nFrom\
  \ the gate\u2026you see trees and flowers. And then, a nice little pool, vast grounds\
  \ and just about 2 cottages. They are grass thatched and the one we were at has\
  \ an outdoor sitting area and, dream of dreams, an outdoor shower. This was when\
  \ I forgot my discomfort at intruding on family time. We could see the River Nile\
  \ from the outdoor living room. Very close and still. I started to relax and become\
  \ more aware of my surroundings. I wanted to build a cottage exactly like this.\
  \ \n\nBut the plan had been to go to the Kayaking festival and so we set off, getting\
  \ lost only a few times because we had the wonderful care taker as guide. \n\nThe\
  \ Kayak festival makes you wonder at the nerve of the rowers. But using their oars,\
  \ they were able to dance through the foaming rapids and emerge unscathed. It was\
  \ good to see that the Nile is a bit like a school teacher whose students are at\
  \ different learning levels; Here were the true dare devils in the violent rapids.\
  \ The ones you hear before you see them. (It was crazy), those trying the more tame\
  \ adrenaline high with Adrift\u2019s white water rafting-experienced kayaker leading\
  \ them through moderate rapids and small kayakers rowing discreetly nearby, ready\
  \ to rush in for a rescue should anyone tip into the River, those who just wanted\
  \ to float in a boat with friends, and the native children who were washing their\
  \ clothes and swimming in the shallow. I joined this last group and swam with abandon\
  \ in water that I could stand in if I wanted. My friends saying I could get sick\
  \ made me feel like such an adventurer. \n\nBy 9pm, we were back at Saranac were\
  \ I promptly slept for 12 hours. The family had gone for a walk when I awoke to\
  \ remember that I was in a mini paradise. I showered under the blue sky, amongst\
  \ stones and flowers growing out of the ground. I walked around the compound barefoot\
  \ next to loitering guinea fowls that didn\u2019t care that I didn\u2019t look like\
  \ them, I swung on a swing obviously meant for children. \nAnd then I saw it, a\
  \ third cottage hidden in the corner. I could hear the Nile. Imagine going to sleep\
  \ against that backdrop. I wanted that. A few feet from it was a little dock where\
  \ you could put your feet right into the river. I sat there for a few minutes listening\
  \ to this beast which was so quiet just a few meters away.\n\nComing back from Jinja,\
  \ we were so relaxed that we seemed to be speaking in slow motion. But it was not\
  \ to last. Kampala brought traffic and bad drivers. Our reality. What we wanted\
  \ was to turn back, we knew we couldn\u2019t."
