Text: "Remember when you were young, full of energy and joy. Not having any idea of\
  \ what\u2019s in the world we live in and how we share our relationships with others.\
  \ You ask me what\u2019s my hobby and i\u2019d Say observing people. Being silent\
  \ and observing people reflects a story of the life we live. Each person I see carries\
  \ a story to be shared and my expertise lie in observing and learning. \nThe last\
  \ time I was trekking the Himalayas and volunteering at an ashram, I learnt to come\
  \ out of a difficult phase in life. Just when I thought that everything was over\
  \ and I may never be able to get back up, I saw doors opening for me to explore\
  \ and learn. It changed my perspective on how I looked at my circumstances. The\
  \ things I felt were my weaknesses turned out to be my greatest strength to form\
  \ the foundation for me to get back and catch up with life. \n\nThe experiences\
  \ that I am a part of today, teach me the principles of maintaining balance in life.\
  \ I am not an expert yet, I am a student, I learn and get better with time. I was\
  \ born in the mindset surrounding the importance of class system. I saw people with\
  \ less money struggle and people with some or lots of money being respected. \n\n\
  After travelling and seeing life by stepping inside the shoes of the families who\
  \ live in the mountains, work hard, earn a living yet stay humble, I learnt the\
  \ fact that this life has more to offer than wealth and a classist ego. I saw men\
  \ and women respecting each other even when they have had no education in their\
  \ growing years. I saw people helping me for no reason just because I was travelling\
  \ alone, I guess they loved my vibe. \n\nA moment of laughter with a stranger, smile\
  \ on the face of a baby, happiness of a dog when it meets you after a long time,\
  \ I run for such moments. These are the moments that make us who we are and put\
  \ us in the place we are meant to be. Travelling is my teacher, I have got the best\
  \ lessons in life by observing, reflecting and self realisation. What I am today,\
  \ how I think and what I feel about life has all been developed by travelling, sharing\
  \ experiences and stories. \n\nOur stories have the right message to be shared with\
  \ our readers who can connect to the dots of the writing done. If you can relate\
  \ to the thoughts I have shared, I know how deep your passion for travelling is.\
  \ I feel it too."
