Text: "She was 16 years old. Pretty face, brave heart. Wished to travel all over the\
  \ globe but some destinations were listed in a proper way. Alaska was one of those\
  \ destinations. She has already travelled there many times. But mentally, not physically.\
  \ Yet. \n\n\nThe most beautiful trip is trip to home. There is no place like home.\
  \  And this place is you. You are an embodiment of your home. Our life is just a\
  \ long travelling to home. We are constantly searching for it. Since teen age we\
  \ are aware of necessarily of running away in searching of place, which we call\
  \ \u201Chome\u201D. Maybe, in this time period we cannot define the meaning of such\
  \ definition as \u201Chome\u201D but what good in your young age is that you less\
  \ think and more feel. When we are growing and gaining this \u201Clife-experience\u201D\
  , whatever it means, and most of us returning back - home. These romantic travelling\
  \ vibes are going deep from our nature. People from the very begging were nomadic,\
  \ in same sense. Of course, society and certain foundations dictate us some aspects\
  \ about settling down. Some of people do, some of us try, the rest just have this\
  \ rebellious spirit, which is pushing you forward all the time. It is \u201Cnaturally\u201D\
  \ to be in each of these conditions but, of course, we cannot define what is 100%\
  \ normally or naturally. \n\nAlaska-girl defines herself as a person, who relies\
  \ on feeling of \u201Cbeing home\u201D. She has had this feeling many times. Her\
  \ home is where she is, that is why she will never lose her home, because it is\
  \ inside of her. But somehow, she also has a feeling that she needs to go there.\
  \ Something is waiting for her ahead, in wild nature\u2026 She is not looking for\
  \ home, she is searching for the feeling. \n\nThat is why her the most interesting,\
  \ exiting and engrossing journey is trip to home.\n\nInhale. Exhale. It was described\
  \ briefly my chaotic life.\nLove. \n@alaskainmysoul"
