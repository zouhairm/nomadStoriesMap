Text: "The gentle whisper of waves on warm sand; ambling down quaint streets in the\
  \ sunlight; lazy, endless days spent sketching the Spanish countryside... a month\
  \ of pure bliss was mine for the taking. \n\nAppearances, however, can be deceptive.\
  \ \n\nI was soon to discover that the cheery, laid-back atmosphere of Benicassim\
  \ was a mask that it only wore until the sun went down, and I, despite my best efforts,\
  \ couldn\u2019t resist the magnetic pull of what lay beneath that mask: an infinite\
  \ chain of moments drenched in effervescent life, all now seared forever in my mind\u2019\
  s eye.\n\nI see the glare of coloured spotlights on cheap body glitter, the sheen\
  \ of bare shoulders in the starlight, the masses of bodies crammed together. I hear\
  \ a chorus throbbing through a thousand voices, each word less coherent than the\
  \ last. I feel a jumble of pulses, hot breath on the back of my neck, a crowd of\
  \ beautiful strangers bleeding infectious, unfiltered vitality.\n\nNow, I\u2019\
  m not usually a festival-goer. In fact, this was my first festival. Young, inexperienced\
  \ and high on the excitement of being free from the watchful eye of my parents,\
  \ I was determined to make the most of it. That meant leaping into the world of\
  \ Spain\u2019s dynamic nightlife, a world that, so far, was alien to me.\n\nUnusually\
  \ for an au pair, I was not yet eighteen. I was responsible for my age, and reasonably\
  \ smart, but I was leagues behind my peers in terms of life experiences. This was\
  \ something I was painfully aware of, and something I was determined not to let\
  \ show. So, when the opportunity to go to the legendary Festival Internacional de\
  \ Benicassim presented itself, I jumped on it. \n\nI bought tickets with another\
  \ au pair, whom I had met a week previously, and we arranged to meet at the festival\
  \ several hours before the main acts were due to start. Alas, the foundations of\
  \ lies and half-truths upon which I had built my new, party-loving persona were\
  \ about to crumble.\n\nAs I approached the gate, ticket in hand, I noticed for the\
  \ first time the separate queues for under- and over-eighteens.\n\nNo problem, I\
  \ thought. Lucy, the girl I was due to meet, had texted to say she was already inside,\
  \ so there was no one to witness my deception as I slipped into the queue. The air\
  \ was dry and dusty, and the hot afternoon sun weighed uncomfortably on the back\
  \ of my neck. By the time I reached the front, my patience was wearing thin. \n\n\
  \u201CSu billete, por favor.\u201D Your ticket, please.\n\nI handed it to her absentmindedly\
  \ and peered over her shoulder, wondering how I\u2019d find Lucy once I\u2019d gotten\
  \ in. The attendant glanced at my ticket and gave me a funny look.\n\n\u201CCan\
  \ I see your signed note of consent from a parent?\u201D she asked, in slow, clear\
  \ Spanish.\n\nMy WHAT??\n\nI gave her my best winning smile and explained that I\
  \ was almost eighteen, and that my friend was waiting inside for me. No dice. She\
  \ couldn\u2019t let me in without the permission of a guardian. \n\nMy heart sank.\
  \ My host parents were already back at the apartment, and I was certain they would\
  \ be less than happy at being summoned across town to sign me in to a music festival.\
  \ My only other option was Lucy. The game was up. She would know I wasn\u2019t,\
  \ as I had vaguely insinuated, halfway through a university degree, like her. I\
  \ would no longer be her equal. \n\nBut I had no choice. I gritted my teeth and\
  \ dialled the number.\n\nShe was surprisingly unruffled about signing me in, and\
  \ casually remarked to me later that she had no idea I was only seventeen. And that\
  \ was it. I had worried for nothing.\n\nThe rest of the night passed in a blur of\
  \ colour and sound, and we danced and sang, buffeted by a sea of people, until the\
  \ last of our energy had left us. Then, blistered, hungry and thoroughly exhausted,\
  \ we trudged the two miles back into town and sat on the promenade watching the\
  \ first golden brushstrokes of the morning sun bleed through the sky."
