Text: "The air smells of sulphur as I step into the darkness. I board the airport\
  \ shuttle, squinting out the window to see the faint outlines of mountains, my excitement\
  \ overcoming exhaustion. On a typical November day, Reykjavik, Iceland will see\
  \ about six hours of sunlight, with the sun rising at 10 AM and setting about 4\
  \ PM. It was five in the morning as I stood in the parking lot of Hallsgrimskirkja\
  \ church. The shuttle bus drives away, taking the only other sign of life with it.\
  \ \n\nThe absolute silence consuming the city at this hour would drive a New Yorker\
  \ insane.\nI almost feel like I have to be quiet, hyper aware of the loud rumbling\
  \ my luggage makes as it bumps along the sidewalk. The eeriness of the silence fades\
  \ away as I walk, and the coziness of the cottage-lined streets makes me feel comfortable\
  \ being the only one outside.\n\nMy peaceful walk ends abruptly. The key isn\u2019\
  t under the flower pot. The Airbnb host isn\u2019t answering my messages. I go into\
  \ the backyard, wondering if I\u2019m at the right address, and I\u2019m met with\
  \ thirty flower pots. Using my phone flashlight, I frantically lift each. Maybe\
  \ it was the lack of sleep, or maybe it was the feeling of an oncoming panic attack,\
  \ but at this moment I could\u2019ve collapsed onto the ground in defeat. Holding\
  \ back tears of frustration, my only option is to wander until the Airbnb owner\
  \ wakes up and returns my messages.\n\nA hotel concierge chuckles at my misfortune,\
  \ but offers me pity coffee and shelter in the warm lobby. I\u2019m relieved at\
  \ the fact that his English is strong but haunted by the knowledge that I must look\
  \ like the stereotypical lost American tourist. I\u2019m surprised at his kindness,\
  \ and he ends up tracking down the Airbnb host on Facebook. He calls the host eight\
  \ times before giving up, but not before explaining an important Icelandic cultural\
  \ attitude: \u201CWe never leave voicemails, we just call and bother them until\
  \ they picks up\u201D. It\u2019s 8 AM and the sky is still black, but the pangs\
  \ in my stomach force me back onto the street in search for food. \n\nI am still\
  \ one of the few people awake in the entire city. I\u2019m relieved to see shop\
  \ lights in the distance turn on, and driven by hunger, pick up my pace. The cafe\
  \ is small but cozy and I finish my ham and cheese sandwich in under a minute. Maybe\
  \ I\u2019m in a good mood from my interaction with the hotel concierge or I\u2019\
  m going crazy with desperation, but I pull up the Airbnb hosts\u2019 Facebook on\
  \ my phone. Trying not to laugh at myself, I show the cafe worker. He laughs but\
  \ is kind when he tells me in a thick accent that he does not know the man. \n\n\
  I\u2019m struggling to stay awake when I hear loud talking in the complicated language.\
  \ The tone is friendly but rushed and the woman laughs as the cafe worker says something\
  \ in response. I think I recognize a recurring word and my ears perk up: \u201C\
  Bjorn\u201D. The name of my Airbnb host. The woman is smiling as she walks over\
  \ to me and says, in perfect English, \u201CI cannot believe this is happening AGAIN!\u201D\
  \ What\u2019s happening again? \u201CNobody can ever find that key! Gu\xF0 minn,\
  \ what a mess!\u201D She sees the confusion on my face. \u201CBjorn is my ex. This\
  \ happens all the time. I\u2019ll be right back.\u201D With this, I watch her run\
  \ down the street. She\u2019s back within a minute, the golden key dangling from\
  \ her hand. \u201CReykjavik is small. Everybody knows everybody.\u201D I\u2019m\
  \ in shock but I try to verbalize my gratitude. \n\nIt\u2019s 9 am and the sun is\
  \ just barely starting to rise. My hands are stiff from the cold as I put the key\
  \ into the lock, but I\u2019m motivated by the knowledge that on the other side\
  \ of the door is a bed waiting to be slept in. I turn the handle, drop my bags,\
  \ kick off my shoes, and collapse onto the bed. By the time I wake up the sun has\
  \ set again."
