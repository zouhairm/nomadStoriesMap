Text: "In the sleepy little town of Ollantaytambo, Peru, nestled within Incan ruins\
  \ in the Andes mountains, is where my family grew bigger. Typically known as a stopover\
  \ town en route to the marvels of Macchu Picchu, Ollantaytambo\u2019s quaint charm\
  \ offers authentic Peruvian essentials: an inviting community, crispy cuy (an Andean\
  \ delicacy of roast guinea pig), and the best damn pisco sour you will ever have,\
  \ although the high altitude is a little less forgiving with a hangover. The scenic\
  \ drive to Ollantaytambo is therapeutic: lush, rolling hills dotted with limestone\
  \ and granite oozing with history. The region boasts stunning ancient landmark walls\
  \ and arches of seemingly perfectly cut stone, curiously from a time where no such\
  \ tools to do so would have existed. The crisp oxygen-deprived air can make you\
  \ a little lightheaded, or it might just be from your brain trying to process the\
  \ beauty of it all. Even though the plan was to collaborate with other students\
  \ from around the world to refurbish homes and build relief centres, I was excited\
  \ to get in some authentic Peruvian sightseeing.\nThe community of Ollantaytambo\
  \ was devastated by the 2007 Richter-eight earthquake: the flourishing valley was\
  \ overrun by escaped criminals from a nearby prison that collapsed upon impact,\
  \ and precious crops and livestock destroyed, severing the livelihood of many locals.\
  \ The line between the surrounding slums slowly blurred. To an untrained eye, the\
  \ delicate historical ruins were indistinguishable from the rubble and wreckage.\n\
  An unexpected addition to our itinerary was at a kindergarten. At the tender age\
  \ of 14, little did I know how the next few hours and the small connection I would\
  \ make would shape me for years to come. The day was an exciting rush of re-tooling\
  \ playground equipment, inhaling the sickly-sweet varnish to re-colour monkey bars\
  \ and see-saws and playing with the children. \nI was drawn to one child in particular,\
  \ who had a mischievous smile not too far off from my own. Her name was Nicole.\
  \ We communicated with a healthy mix of broken Spanish (on my part) and large hand\
  \ gestures. Nicole was four years old. She lived in the slum but could afford to\
  \ go to the town kindergarten because her mother worked for a shopkeeper (or was\
  \ it beekeeper? I cursed my lack of Spanish vocabulary) nearby. I asked Nicole if\
  \ she wanted to stamp her hand prints beside my bright blue palms on the collectively\
  \ painted mural; she giggled, and stamped her yellow-painted hands inside of mine.\n\
  I finally took a break and visited the lunch room, which was housed at a neighboring\
  \ church uphill. I heard a small gasp behind me -- Nicole had followed me, her eyes\
  \ wide at the sight of food available to our group. I offered as many bags as I\
  \ could carry and we carted them down the cobbled streets to the kindergarten. \n\
  Winding through the stone terraces, my vantage point facing downhill was stunning.\
  \ The late afternoon light cast a soft glow, with the low clouds giving the entire\
  \ region a gentle hug. Upon arrival back at the kindergarten, Nicole\u2019s teacher\
  \ explained her mother had come and left in a rush to prepare dinner for the family.\
  \ \nThe idea of little Nicole walking home alone as the sunlight slowly faded made\
  \ me uncomfortable, so I hoisted her onto my back (and apparently 20 pounds of apples\
  \ from the food sacks!) and set out to take her home. Did I mention I was 14 and\
  \ didn\u2019t tell anyone where I was going?\nThe cobbled streets turned to rough\
  \ unpaved roads; sleek stone buildings turned to mixtures of corrugated cardboard\
  \ and aluminum boasting soda brands. The afternoon glow had faded into a sinister\
  \ shadow. Before my thoughts could be overrun with concern, Nicole\u2019s excited\
  \ shrieks cut through - she loved the bumpy sensation as I avoided ankle-destroying\
  \ rocks along way. I gave Nicole a big hug upon dropping her off. She squeezed my\
  \ hand and said to me, \u201CEres mi hermana.\u201D\nTears welled up in my eyes.\
  \ I had always wanted a sister. \nIt was worth every second of scolding from my\
  \ group leader."
