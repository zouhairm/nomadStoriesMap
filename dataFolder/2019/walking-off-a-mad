Text: "I never thought I'd meet a woman with no legs walking an 800km pilgrimage.\
  \  \n\tI meet her sitting outside a dusty cafe on the high pleateaus of the Meseta\
  \ in Northern Spain.  I shove my heavy, ugly pink backpack on the ground and slump\
  \ into a plastic chair.  Anger and frustration weighed down my pack.  I've been\
  \ walking off a mad this morning, and need a break.  \n\t\"I know anger well.\"\
  \  She says to me with a tired, knowing smile. \n\tShe's German, in her mid-fifties,\
  \ deep bags under sharp eyes.  Tangled grey hair, a heavy sweater, and a long, grey\
  \ skirt.  A scrappy oatmeal-colored terrier on her lap.  Her walking companion,\
  \ a younger, lanky, bearded nurse, sits beside her. \n\tWe're both two weeks--roughly\
  \ 300km--into our walks on the Camino de Santiago.  Part of a medieval pilgrimage\
  \ that modern folks like us undertake for various religious or personal reasons.\
  \  Both headed in the same direction: West, to Santiago de Compostela.  Both carry\
  \ packs full of clothes, snacks, fears, insecurities, and hope.\n\t But one major\
  \ difference:  I have sunburned legs and blistered feet.  She has metal poles for\
  \ legs and prosthetic feet inside muddy trekking shoes.   \n\t\"What brought you\
  \ out here?\" I ask the question every pilgrim asks each other.  \n\t\"I didn't\
  \ understand why I needed to do it, but I knew I had to walk the Camino.  Nothing\
  \ was going to stop me.\" She says.\n\t\"And believe me, we tried.\"  The nurse\
  \ man chimes in.  \"We told her she cannot do this, it's too dangerous for her,\
  \ but you are talking to an amazingly stubborn woman here.\"  \n\tShe swats him\
  \ with her hand and laughs. \n\t\"I had some money so I convinced Hans here to come\
  \ along.  He only agreed because we also have the van with the medical equipment\
  \ nearby.\" \n\t\"Yeah, so she walks and I sit and drive the wheelchair, and when\
  \ she gets tired we swap.\"  Hans says.\n\t\"Besides all of my health problems,\
  \ I have a bad relationship with my sister.  She's the only family I have left,\
  \ and I've been holding on to a lot of anger towards her.\"  She strokes the little\
  \ dog on her lap. The dog has a job too: to sleep next to her heart at night and\
  \ alert the nurse if her heartbeat goes out of whack.  Or stops.  \n\tAll morning\
  \ I'd been angry.  Tendonitis in my left ankle flared up, I was running on three\
  \ hours of sleep a night for the last week, and my internal demons were surfacing.\
  \  Angry that I couldn't control my feelings, couldn't hide them. \n\t\"But out\
  \ here, I have faced a lot of my own anger.  When I get back to Germany I'm going\
  \ to call my sister.  Already I've let go of so much anger toward my family, my\
  \ life, my health problems.  And it's only been two weeks.\"  She dabs her eyes\
  \ with a hankerchief.  Then turns to Hans. \n\t\"And Hans here has certainly been\
  \ surprised by the Camino, haven't you?\"  She laughs.  Hans nods, a big grin across\
  \ his face.\n\t\"When I began this walk, I thought I was here just to do my duty\
  \ as a nurse. But now, it's also become my journey, which I never expected.  And\
  \ then I met someone out here.  An Italian woman. I'm 42 years old and I'm in love.\
  \  None of this would have happened if I hadn't come out here.\"  He says. \n\t\
  I smile at these two, softened.  My anger dissipating into the dry Meseta air. \
  \  \t\n\tI had my legs, my own two feet.  I didn't need a dog to monitor my heart\
  \ or a nurse for aid.  I thought I just needed a break this morning.  But really,\
  \ I needed to hear her story.  Needed to feel humbled and awed by someone with such\
  \ resolute determination.  \n\t I look down at my blistered feet, swollen ankle\
  \ and say Thank you, thank you. This woman had more courage, more determination,\
  \ than I'd ever seen in my comparatively easy, sheltered life. \n\tWe hug.  Wish\
  \ each other a Buen Camino.  I hoped she would make it to Santiago.  \n\tWhen I\
  \ hitch my pack on to keep going, it feels lighter."
