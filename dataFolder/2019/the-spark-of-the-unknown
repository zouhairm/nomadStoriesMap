Text: "The day I arrived to St Marteen in March 2018 , my surprise was getting into\
  \ an airport that was just a modified tent for travelers.\nEverything was very organized\
  \ , immigration was very helpful and easy to interact.\nDidn\u2019t realize hurac\xE1\
  n Irma in September 2017 did so much damage to the beautiful st Martin/st Maarten\
  \ islands.\nOn my way to st Martin saw a lot of destruction everywhere, and then\
  \ realized there were no stop lights at all so people drive as they can, lots of\
  \ motorcycles and just small cars.\nThe roads were just  two lines and narrow, little\
  \ scary sometimes.\nSo I stayed on the French side St Martin and everybody is open\
  \ mind , very friendly and layback . There ate nudist beaches and you can decide\
  \ go total nude, top less or use your swimsuit, not matter.  No one is there to\
  \ judge or harassed you.\nPeople struggling to survive but they do not quit and\
  \ do whatever it takes to offer the best they have.  On the other side st Marteen\
  \ less destroyed \nBut different atmosphere.\nPeople more conservative,the majority\
  \ speaks English and I can say it\u2019s whete the party goes everyday.\nLove it\
  \ and will be back again, love the freedom I could feel there, the food , the people\
  \ and the beautiful scenery even with the destruction ."
