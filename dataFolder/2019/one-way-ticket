Text: "I stroll along the pavement that twists its way to the school gate. A road\
  \ I\u2019ve walked at least a hundred times, but today the path feels different.\
  \ There is a vigorous energy pulsating through the air and through my veins. I begin\
  \ to run, as I round the corner the school comes into sight. A sea of people lines\
  \ the entrance of the campus, waiting for the next tide to gently drift into the\
  \ school court yard. There must be 2,000; no, 3,000 men, women, and teenagers. Mothers\
  \ stand weeping holding their daughters hand-in-hand, fathers embrace their sons,\
  \ handmade signs are thrust into the air, and rings of laughter echo throughout\
  \ the mountains that surround the school. I look up to the black electronic billboard\
  \ posted high on the teaching building. All I see is the number 0 flashing in bold\
  \ red before everyone in sight. \n\nThe day is June 8. Students in grade 12 all\
  \ across the country have just finished the Gaokao: China\u2019s National College\
  \ Entrance Exam. I gaze into the crowd to witness a multitude of emotions strewn\
  \ across every face. One thousand Chinese students pour forth from the teaching\
  \ building, flooding the courtyard.  Each face is overcome with exhaustion; every\
  \ breath taken exhales a sigh of relief. They have just spent the last three days\
  \ testing in all core subjects. The results of their test scores only will determine\
  \ the universities in which they are admitted. \n\nIn the midst of all the students,\
  \ I recognize a familiar face. A face that looks weary, yet at the same time bright.\
  \ The face of a girl whose English name is Dawn. My thoughts drift back to a day,\
  \ not so long ago, when I stood in this very courtyard with her. On that day I probed,\
  \ \u201CWhat do you want to do in life, Dawn?\u201D \u201CI must get into a good\
  \ university first and then I can decide,\u201D she answered blankly. I paused momentarily,\
  \ only to retort \u201CGoing to a good university isn\u2019t the only way to succeed\
  \ in life. You have plenty of alternative avenues.\u201D She tilted her head and\
  \ lowered her hands, \u201CAnd that is where your country and my country differ.\u201D\
  \ Dawn continued, \u201CYou must understand that in China I have a one way ticket.\
  \ That one way ticket gives me the chance to provide a better life for myself and\
  \ my family. The only way to get that ticket is to study hard each day and hope\
  \ to be admitted into a top university. For me, there are no other options.\u201D\
  \  \n\nI lock eyes with Dawn. She approaches me and I smile in congratulations asking,\
  \ \u201CDid you get your ticket?\u201D She laughs and says, \u201CI think I did.\
  \ I\u2019m one of the lucky ones.\u201D As she walks away I consider her words,\
  \ reflecting on the pressures of every student who lives and breathes at this school.\
  \ A pressure whose weight is placed upon them by their teachers, who in turn feel\
  \ pressure from the administration, who feel it from the educational bureau, who\
  \ feel it from the provincial authorities, who feel it from the capital. I think\
  \ about the days, months, and years these students have spent preparing for this\
  \ very moment. Day 0. The day they complete the Gaokao and the pressure is finally\
  \ released. \n\nTwo weeks pass and I return to the school. The campus is quiet.\
  \ The families are gone. The newly admitted grade 12 students sit diligently at\
  \ their desks. I cannot see their faces, every head stares down, studying textbooks\
  \ that sit a foot high on their desks. I peer out towards the black electronic billboard.\
  \ In bold red it reads \u79BB\u9AD8\u8003\u8FD8\u6709340\u5929. 340 days until the\
  \ Gaokao. The clock has been reset and another countdown begins."
