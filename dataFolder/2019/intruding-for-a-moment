Text: "I was ignoring the red biro suggestions on the flimsy map from the man at the\
  \ hostel\u2019s front desk. Split is small. Whatever it had to offer me in the next\
  \ few days, I\u2019ll find on my own. \nUnmarked by red lines, I saw a little synagogue\
  \ labelled \u2019Jewish Community of Split\u2019. It was noon and on my travels\
  \ I had grown accustomed, at this time of day, to escaping from the heat in the\
  \ halls of cathedrals, castles, or any ancient structure cool and echoing. \nI followed\
  \ the map, each street getting narrower and, as I got nearer, I saw a small clutch\
  \ of people.  I joined their ranks, glanced up a steep flight of stairs and noticed\
  \ a piece of A4 printer paper with \u2018Synagogue\u2019 typed in Arial tacked to\
  \ a door. I was stood with them for less than a minute before I was ready to flee\
  \ to the town square, and try a new ice cream flavour instead.\nBut then the door\
  \ opened and an elderly man welcomed us. Anxiety gave way to curiosity, but the\
  \ aching anonymity of the place lingered.  Our little huddle filed ahead of the\
  \ old man who had lead us up the stairs and into a small, beige room. The midday\
  \ heat disappeared behind us.\nSharp shunts and thuds shook me out of my relief.\
  \ The old man had barred and bolted the door behind us. For half a second terrible\
  \ thoughts ran through my head but once he was done he turned and smiled. \n\u2018\
  Welcome, Lippmanns,\u2019 he said, \u2018you come far?\u2019\nI looked around the\
  \ small group I had attached myself to and realised they were all the same family.\
  \ How I had not seen the resemblance before now? And here I was; an outsider crashing\
  \ their private tour. \n\u2018The States,\u2019 the patriarch of this family replied,\
  \ \u2018thanks for showing us around.\u2019\nI shrank back behind the group but\
  \ there were too few of us to truly hide. With sun-bleached, golden hair and blue\
  \ eyes, I couldn\u2019t look more out of place next to this family with thick dark\
  \ tresses. No-one commented on my presence as we were led through the double doors.\
  \ \nThe poky exterior belied the size of synagogue that lay within. In front of\
  \ the ark, a young man stood praying. He was bound in Tefillin and bowing rhythmically\
  \ with his hands in front of his face. The old man ignored him and brought us further\
  \ inside to get a better look.  The room could have been part of something much\
  \ larger and grander, with high ceilings, arches and chandeliers. You could hardly\
  \ tell it was\u2026\n\u2018The upper floors of two medieval houses,\u2019 the old\
  \ man said, \u2018in the old Jewish ghetto in the 16th century. This hidden spot\
  \ was chosen, to keep us safe at a time when we were not.\u2019\nThere were long,\
  \ dark wooden benches extending the length of the synagogue and the tour group perched.\
  \ I sat opposite the Lippmans, not bothering to hide anymore. The old man told us\
  \ of Split\u2019s tiny Jewish community, never exceeding 300 people, who were nearly\
  \ all descended from extermination camp survivors and never had a Rabbi to lead\
  \ their congregation. Just as he was telling us that, as a group, they weren\u2019\
  t very religious, the young man praying turned around.\n\u2018Sorry but this next\
  \ bit is out loud.\u2019\nAs soon as we nodded he turned back to the ark and sang\
  \ out his prayer in fast, throaty Hebrew. The old man looked on, in no hurry to\
  \ get through his tour. We listened, in no rush ourselves. \nWhen the singing finished,\
  \ the old man invited us to view their small selection of treasures; Torahs hundreds\
  \ of years old shrouded in soft fabrics and silver altar ware. Survivors from centuries\
  \ of persecution. \nI was feeling quite at home when it was time to unbolt the doors,\
  \ expose the heat, and leave. The Lippmans left before me, shaking the hands of\
  \ the old man on their way out. For the first time, he looked directly at me. \n\
  \u2018Sorry for intruding,\u2019 I said depositing a few Kuna into the collection\
  \ box.\n\u2018No,\u2019 he said, \u2018all are welcome here.\u2019"
