Text: "Between Dulwich, a quiet neighborhood filled with young families, and Brixton,\
  \ the epicenter of Jamaican culture in London, stands Peckham. It seems like a village\
  \ of its own, with its language, its people, its colors and smells. It vibrates\
  \ by its population, mostly African immigrants from past colonies, who have brought\
  \ to Europe their traditions, clothes, food, religions. \n\nThe Main Street is called\
  \ Rye Lane. It overflows with shops of all kinds. The same store can provide a wide\
  \ range of services, like buying gold, making credit, selling old CDs, trading clothes\
  \ for food, food for clothes, and even serve alcohol. Peckham rejoices of these\
  \ places, filled with unknown people, mothers and children, bums and junkies, grandpas\
  \ and accountants and artists and students, and local women who sell you strange\
  \ fruit and smelly fish. It's a melting pot of people that came from nowhere and\
  \ everywhere.\nSmall coffee shops dwell on their oversized breakfasts; Jerk food\
  \ fills the streets with its smell. And then, there are the barber shops ( decorated\
  \ with black and white printed images of colored celebrities, red and green aprons,\
  \ clogs of hair abandoned on the sidewalk ) where packs of men hang out day and\
  \ night. In the evening, people go to hidden pubs, bars in caravans, a pizzeria\
  \ in an old bus. They go see concerts in old sellars, dj sets in abandoned parking\
  \ lots. They want to preserve all these places a secret.\nAt night, you can see\
  \ waves of people dressed in white with unusual hats. Sects of all kind hide in\
  \ basements, singing their lungs out. \nIn the daytime, school kids in uniforms\
  \ run to buy fried chicken.\n\nPeople who've lived in Peckham since childhood have\
  \ witnessed its transformation. R., a 60year-old man, tells me that \"these dirty\
  \ black people\" have invaded his hometown. Peckham has been the stage of violent\
  \ riots in 2011, with other South London Burroughs ( Brixton, Battersea, Ealing,\
  \ Barking, Lewisham, East Ham...). This occurred following the fatal police shooting\
  \ of Mark Duggan, a black man. After these riots, violence in the black community\
  \ as well as racism have been escalating ever since, with the occasional mugging,\
  \ or even murder.\nPeckham still holds the reputation of a dangerous place. Its\
  \ inhabitants, though, think of it as a precious community, almost a piece of themselves,\
  \ with an abundant art scene ( thanks to its cheap studios and art schools near\
  \ by ). The people who have made Peckham have it in their soul, I heard.\n\nOld\
  \ factories hide huge skateparks; a recording studio in a restaurant, counterfeit\
  \ brands. \nRecently, this scene has been threatened by a wave of gentrification.\
  \ Since Peckham's population is composed of mostly poor families and indebted students,\
  \ if prices rise up, they'll all have to leave, yet stick together in a further\
  \ neighborhood who's survived this effect. Somehow, people are united in their isolation\
  \ from the rest of the expensive city, a solidarity emerges from the streets- packed\
  \ in the daytime, empty at night.\nNext to this chaotic setting stands the local\
  \ cinema, the cheapest in London. Rumors said that it was going to be destroyed,\
  \ which revolted everyone who wanted to preserve \xAB\_the true spirit of Peckham\_\
  \xBB, a place of affordable entertainment and extravagant design. The entire inside\
  \ and outside of the cinema is painted in a bright candy colored pink, the front\
  \ reads the name of the movie theater in graffiti.\nThis cinema is a symbol. \"\
  It's one of the rare places where all people from the neighborhood come together\"\
  \ says D., a Peckham resident since 2009 ( But do they see the same movies ? ).\
  \ \"Everyone loves it, it's like our mascot\", she adds, looking nostalgically at\
  \ the small cinema.\n\nPeckham leaves me with a sensory overload. What details will\
  \ stick with me among this mass of information ? Its fish hanging from the ceilings,\
  \ or encens ? Neon signs above churches, flags flickering in the wind ? The gospel\
  \ choir with trumpets. Or maybe an old man pouring his heart out on the sidewalk,\
  \ with nothing left in a world who doesn\u2019t know who he is."
