Text: "They say that there are three types of traveller. \n\nFirst, the planners.\
  \ These are the people who travel for the wonderment of planning a trip and the\
  \ worlds that they create in their imagination. \n\nThen, there are the doers. The\
  \ people who love to live in the moment, in a place far outside of their comfort\
  \ zone. \n\nFinally; the sharers. Those who enjoy telling stories of their adventures\
  \ for years to come. \n\n\nI am very much a planner. I plan more trips than I complete.\
  \ \n\nImagine my surprise then, when for the first time ever, I went on a trip that\
  \ made me consider my past, more so than my future. \n\n\nLast summer, on my way\
  \ to Laos, I took a short detour via Thailand - a country I once lived in during\
  \ my gap-year. I didn't expect to achieve much whilst I was there, other than showing\
  \ my face and maintaining my promise to return. \n\nThe trip marked the 5-year anniversary\
  \ of my life there; a distant recollection from my youth. \n\nThe memories that\
  \ I carried from this country were bittersweet. After my return to the UK, it had\
  \ taken me 2 years to properly begin telling stories about my time there. People\
  \ had been quick to tell me how jealous they were of what I had done and how much\
  \ luckier I was than them - as if our circumstances were remarkably different. They\
  \ would dismiss my negative stories with the echoing reply \u201Cyou\u2019ve grown\
  \ stronger because of it\u201D. \n\nI\u2019m one of the biggest advocates for travel\
  \ there can be, but I didn\u2019t agree with the age-old assumption that travel\
  \ always equals growth. On one level, I had gained a sophisticated cultural awareness\
  \ of those unlike myself, I had learnt to live on my own and how to adapt to strange\
  \ surroundings. But none of this was something I hadn\u2019t been able to achieve\
  \ just moving to a new city in the UK.  \n\n\nTravelling had drained me. It had\
  \ made me question my concept of self so much that I returned feeling lost. I had\
  \ combatted such horrendous situations in among the happy times, that I struggled\
  \ to decide whether it had all been worth it. \n\nAs I planned my return to Thailand,\
  \ I was met with anxiety. Not for the places that I was travelling to, but because,\
  \ for the first time ever, I was having to confront the \u2018me\u2019 part of travelling.\
  \ \n\nI loathed myself. I felt anger towards that na\xEFve girl that thought that\
  \ a year away on my own was a good idea. So much had changed in the past 5-years;\
  \ I barely recognised myself from then. \n\nI remembered myself, aged 18, hiding\
  \ my identity from those around me. I was so confused by the new norms surrounding\
  \ me, that I had attempted to become \u2018the ideal Thai\u2019. \n\nIn retrospect,\
  \ all that this had achieved was giving people an impression that I was untrustworthy.\
  \ \u2018But how could I have survived any other way?\u2019 I thought. Everything\
  \ I stood for was everything they didn\u2019t, and I wasn\u2019t prepared to live\
  \ that year completely alone. \n\n\nI was returning with a new face \u2013 my real\
  \ identity, both pure and matured \u2013 would they even recognise me? This could\
  \ be the trip where I lost all of those friends that had begged me to return!\n\n\
  \nThen\u2026 I actually arrived into the country. The overwhelming smells and heat\
  \ that I remembered were not at all as strong as I thought. The people were just\
  \ going about their normal everyday lives and I realised that without me, their\
  \ lives had continued. \n\nI felt sorry for younger me \u2013 for her, these experiences\
  \ were overwhelming. She couldn\u2019t recognise the everyday. Her fear of loneliness\
  \ had warped the entire experience. \n\nIn that moment I grew a respect for younger\
  \ Jane \u2013 she may have been immature, but she was the bravest, strongest and\
  \ most curious person I have ever known. \n\nI began to reconnect with a part of\
  \ myself I had abandoned years ago. I accepted that she was a different person,\
  \ but I learnt to love her, flaws and all. It took a while, but in the end, travelling\
  \ really did make me stronger."
