Text: "After enduring two missed flights and delays, unpredictable August monsoon\
  \ rains causing a terrifying turbulence, some heated discussions, and weeks of contemplation\
  \ of whether I should push with this trip, I finally landed in the thriving city\
  \ of Bangalore. I cannot believe it. I am in India. I finally made it after almost\
  \ a decade of wishing and hoping. \n\nUnsure of what to expect in this foreign city,\
  \ I only have one mission \u2013 to see him for the first time, and maybe for the\
  \ last time too.\n\nHaving gone through a stressful flight and being in a foreign\
  \ country in a different time zone and culture, not to mention the incessant news\
  \ about the sexual assault on women, I needed to feel safe. I looked for him in\
  \ the crowd at the arrival area, hoping he'll be there to make me feel alright.\
  \ It was the farthest place I have been to so far. I looked at the crowd once more,\
  \ there I found a tall, dark man with charming set of eyes holding a sign with my\
  \ name on it. But it wasn't him. It was the chauffeur the hotel sent to pick me\
  \ up.\n\nI observed this new world from the untainted windows of the luxury car\
  \ as we drive to my hotel. The scenes weren't totally new. I see these daily back\
  \ home - people trying to board a loaded bus during the 6pm rush hour, honking cars\
  \ trapped in a chaotic traffic, barefooted kids running around, and random people\
  \ on the streets. Yet seeing Hindu temples left and right, women on bright-colored\
  \ saris, men in vibrant turbans, Bollywood stars in enormous billboards, and the\
  \ distinct Indian features of most people, still made it so foreign to me. It was\
  \ a glimpse of the country and culture I so longed to see, a fascination that started\
  \ 9 years ago when we first met.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the next morning when I\
  \ finally saw him for the first time. It was magical. Even more magical than the\
  \ enchanting beauty of India. \n\nThe next few days exposed me to what this city\
  \ has to offer. I visited the historic Bangalore Palace, walked through the MG and\
  \ Brigade roads where the locals frequent, rode a rickety rickshaw, witnessed Kollywood\
  \ movie being filmed, smelled the exotic aroma of chicken biryani, and spent unforgettable\
  \ moments with him. Bangalore distracted me too much, it made me forget all these\
  \ has an ending. The magic didn\u2019t last long.\n\nBack at the airport once again,\
  \ I saw him ran towards the departure area looking to find a familiar face. I tapped\
  \ the giant glass wall that separated us. His eyes found me. \u201CThey won\u2019\
  t let me out anymore,\u201D I said. He looked at me with piercing sadness as I showed\
  \ him my boarding pass. I am leaving in an hour to go back to Manila, but I am leaving\
  \ my heart in Bangalore. Behind the glass, we talked through our mobile phones saying\
  \ the saddest words ever told. \u201CIt\u2019s not going to be the last time,\u201D\
  \ he said as he fought back his tears. I disagreed.\n\nStill on the phone, I headed\
  \ to the immigration checkpoint. From the blurry glass wall, I saw him looking back\
  \ at me. Our time was running out. He cried as he started to walk away but stopped\
  \ and turned several times to see me until he faded before my eyes. It was the day\
  \ India broke my heart. The culture of dowry and arranged marriages tore me apart\
  \ \u2013 his family arranged him to marry someone else."
