Text: "Within an hour of meeting Rajeev, I was riding on the back of his motorbike\
  \ as we traversed dirt roads in rural India.  I covered the lower half of my face\
  \ with a turquoise colored scarf as dust swirled around us. \t\n\tA motorbike carrying\
  \ my sister and driven by our friend Maroof pulled up alongside us.  My sister and\
  \ I exchanged looks of wonder.  Around us, green fields stretched on as far as the\
  \ eye could see while water buffalo grazed on the banks of a skinny river.  We were\
  \ in the middle of nowhere, and it was incredible.\n\tEven if you showed me a map\
  \ today, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell you exactly where we were.  I was allowing\
  \ myself to be whisked away, instead of my usual travel behavior of over-planning,\
  \ and the reason I could do that was because we were with locals.  \n\tMy sister\
  \ and I had met Maroof in Delhi a week before.  He suggested we take the train down\
  \ to the province of Madhya Pradesh, where we could see temples, and visit his childhood\
  \ friend, Rajeev.  The two grew up in Kashmir together before both families left\
  \ due to the growing conflict between Pakistan and India.  \n\tRajeev and his family\
  \ owned a fabric store in Khajurajo, a small town known for medieval temples covered\
  \ in erotic carvings.  We were spending only one day there, so Maroof and Rajeev\
  \ decided the best way to show us the area was to rent motorbikes.\n\tAfter Delhi,\
  \ a city of 19 million people, the landscapes we were seeing seemed impossibly rural.\
  \  Ours were the only vehicles on the road, and occasionally we passed small farms\
  \ where people were working the fields. \n\tRajeev called to Maroof in Hindi, and\
  \ soon we were pulling off in front of one of the farms.  \n\tWe got off the bikes\
  \ and Rajeev told us he thought the family who lived here would show us their farm.\
  \  We were greeted by an older woman with carefully parted white hair, barefoot\
  \ and wearing a flowered vermillion sari and a younger woman in a brilliant blue\
  \ and pink patterned sari.  They spoke no English, only the local language, but\
  \ after Rajeev talked to them, they were friendly and welcoming.  The women led\
  \ us back the road to their land, past a hand-stacked brick building and a water\
  \ buffalo who stuck his head out as we passed, his eyes wild and his nostrils flared.\
  \ \n\tThere was only one other small building on their property; a one room white\
  \ stucco house with a roof supported by tree limbs.  There were other people on\
  \ the farm too; a man not much older than the four of us, two teenage girls in their\
  \ school uniforms of loose fitting white pants and sky blue tunics, and a skinny\
  \ boy wearing tiny shorts. \n\tI wondered if they all lived here, sharing the small\
  \ stucco house.\n\tMaroof was soon holding a baby goat, and we were all laughing.\
  \  The man offered us a tour of the fields, and the four of us compared the English\
  \ names for the crops with the Hindi names, a little game of translation.  We saw\
  \ mustard plants, sarson, and a pile of turmeric roots, haldi.\t\n\tThe women showed\
  \ us that they were churning butter, demonstrating how they agitated the silver\
  \ pot of buffalo milk by pulling on a rope tied around a large wooden pole.  The\
  \ white haired woman motioned for me to try, and I gave my best effort, all of us\
  \ laughing.   \n\tWhen we waved goodbye, got back on our motorcycles and drove off\
  \ down the dirt road, we were all still smiling and laughing.  \n\tIn India, it\
  \ can be hard to penetrate the wall that exists between locals and tourists.  I\
  \ sometimes felt daunted by the way the tourism industry in India is designed to\
  \ shield travelers from the darker aspects of the country.  Many Western tourists\
  \ are happy to take the road most traveled, but as soon as we got off the beaten\
  \ path, I found it to be a country that is full of warm, friendly people who love\
  \ nothing more than to show you their India."
