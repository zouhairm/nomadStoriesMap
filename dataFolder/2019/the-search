Text: "\u2018You guys are crazy\u2019 we heard again and again, the echo imprinted\
  \ in our minds.\n\nCrazy? Maybe. But determined? Definitely. \n\nWe chatted to the\
  \ Tuk-Tuk driver assuring him that our level of Tuk-Tuk driving was enough, sure\
  \ we\u2019d ridden a moped before. Was that not the same thing? \n\nA confident\
  \ exterior hid a nervous wreck of an interior as the streets of Aragum bay were\
  \ hustling and bustling with people moving far too fast for this early Saturday\
  \ morning. \n\nA quick slurp of our fresh coconuts and It was time. Surf boards\
  \ attached securely(ish) to the roof of our fluorescent green new companion and\
  \ with the taste of adventure in our mouths we hit the road. \n\nIf one has not\
  \ experienced the back-packing tourist side of Sri Lanka they may think that you\
  \ are driven around in an air-conditioned van from eco-resort to eco-resort but\
  \ for the tight budgeted travellers this was our reality, and we were thriving in\
  \ it! \n\nThe exhilaration of doing something quite absurd, which was definitely\
  \ not the done thing was quite spectacular. We were gliding along, wind in our hair,\
  \ a few humorous looks but nothing that would dampen our spirits. We navigated by\
  \ local's directions past the lakes where the storks flocked, passing our fellow\
  \ community of Tuk-Tuks with one place in mind as our destination - the waves of\
  \ Elephant Rock. \n\nThe second to final leg of our journey was a little hairy,\
  \ we had too many close escapes of a vehicle topple to recall. The tension I held\
  \ in my shoulders as I tried to steer the beast stayed with me for many days after.\
  \ But after these twists and turns our convoy reached the open sands. \n\nWe had\
  \ made it; the relief was felt with a unison of sighs. After a minute of composure,\
  \ the sound of the waves crashing took our attention. Unloading our beautiful, undamaged\
  \ boards we made our way to the oceans shore. Without previous warning, we now had\
  \ to embark on a lake crossing with an abundance of signs saying \u2018DANGER CROCODILES\u2019\
  . Now we were here, our journey could not be wasted and we could smell the salt\
  \ from the ocean so we took our chances.\n\nCrossing on a packed wooden float compiled\
  \ of plastic tubs and a wooden structure we sailed along the lake, with no crocodile\
  \ in site. The sun was starting to dip from its optimal mid-day height and the waves\
  \ were pumping, calling us by name. \n\nTouching down on the sand on the other side,\
  \ strapping our leashes to grazed ankles and experiencing that indescribable feeling\
  \ of running without hesitation into the depths of the blue. The cooling sensation\
  \ on our hot bodies was the only refreshment we needed to paddle into the sets.\n\
  \nSitting on my board, with the oceans vastness surrounding me I watched with a\
  \ contentedness in my heart as my friends old and new were all fixated on the a-framing\
  \ peaks of the rolling waves. The jagged headland of Elephant rock created a path\
  \ where only few surfers would go, to surf but to avoid this large obstruction.\
  \ We wooped and cheered as the surfers glided on the glassy lines. \n\nWe could\
  \ have stayed just like that forever, watching the water, listening to nature\u2019\
  s song and sharing the waves. But, the sun was tiring and as it settled on the sea\
  \ the sky ran crimson and gold and everything appeared just like a movie or a dream.\
  \ Our bodies started to shiver now the sun had shone its last and we dragged ourselves\
  \ out of our muse ready to embark on the journey in reverse. Exhausted and a little\
  \ apprehensive for our journey into the but very, very content."
