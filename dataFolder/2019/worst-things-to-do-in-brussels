Text: "\u201CNon non non!\u201D, yelled the police officer when I reached for the\
  \ waistband of my boxer briefs. He gestured to me to turn around, and after I obliged\
  \ him, he said \u201CVous pouvez vous habillez\u201D. I nodded and got back into\
  \ my shirt and trousers.\n\nThe few of us who\u2019d bothered to do some research\
  \ declared that Delirium Caf\xE9 was the place to go to. We wanted to shake off\
  \ the torpor of the first day of a study trip covering EU institutions, and were\
  \ in no mood to argue. So we made the obligatory stop at the unexpectedly diminutive\
  \ Manneken Pis, wolfed down some waffles, and headed into the place where I would\
  \ trigger my downfall. The legendary variety of beers on offer at Delirium was very\
  \ impressive, and I was determined to try at least a handful.\n\nShould alarm bells\
  \ have started ringing when I stepped on top of a glass-topped table to get past\
  \ it, rather than take the long way round? \n\nOlder than most of my classmates\
  \ by at least a decade, I must have felt compelled to step into the role of the\
  \ fun older brother, and everybody seemed to be enjoying the performance. Well,\
  \ at least the few that were left as we closed down the place.\n\nWe ran out of\
  \ places to go to, but doggedly persisted on foot, finding sources of amusement\
  \ in the most humdrum of things. We seemed to be the only people on the street,\
  \ and began to dare each other to silly feats. When someone challenged me to get\
  \ on top of a car, I didn\u2019t think twice before purposefully approaching a parked\
  \ station wagon. \n\nA video taken by a classmate shows me slowly crawling up the\
  \ car\u2019s bonnet, accompanied by raucous peals of laughter. I get on top, stand\
  \ up and break into the first line of \u201CSinging in the Rain\u201D (it was, unsurprisingly\
  \ for Brussels, raining). The laughter suddenly dies down as a sharp figure cuts\
  \ into the frame, briskly approaching the car as he yells at me in French. He grabs\
  \ me by the hand and yanks me to the ground. \n\nHe\u2019s wearing some kind of\
  \ uniform, and in less than a minute our faces are washed with the flashing red\
  \ and blue lights of a patrol car. The next thing I know, I\u2019m in the back of\
  \ the car, hands cuffed behind my back. I hear my classmates trying in vain to reason\
  \ with the officers as the car sets off. A half-hour\u2019s drive through unrecognisable\
  \ landmarks and forgettable cityscapes, and we\u2019re at a police station. \n\n\
  They take me in and I\u2019m made to sit on a bench while they initiate the paperwork.\
  \ \u201CJe crois que je vais vomir\u201D, and someone hands me a comically large\
  \ plastic bag. I stare into its depths until the feeling passes.\n\nMy bag, belt,\
  \ jacket, coat and shoes, fingerprints and mugshot are taken from me, deshabillez-vous,\
  \ habillez-vous, et hop! After my dismal performance, they usher me into my cell,\
  \ which is reassuringly empty.\n\nI wake up well rested, relieved at the absence\
  \ of a hangover. As I sit up and go over the night\u2019s events in the harsh fluorescent\
  \ glare, I\u2019m filled with more than the usual amount of remorse. I notice a\
  \ bottle of water and two buns on the floor, drink the water and ignore the buns.\
  \ \n\nIn the midst of unsuccessfully trying to find a means of communicating with\
  \ the world outside, I'm suddenly startled by the crackle of an intercom that had\
  \ somehow escaped my attention. I\u2019m asked if I understand French, to which\
  \ I foolishly reply in the affirmative. A while later, the door clangs open and\
  \ I\u2019m ushered out. My belongings are returned to me in sealed bags, and I sign\
  \ off on them. I think I understand what they\u2019re saying as they point out places\
  \ on forms to sign. I\u2019m handed a sheaf of papers and shown the way out. In\
  \ the noonday sun, I blink at the first page: \n\n\u201CORDRE DE QUITTER LE TERRITOIRE\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CYou are directed to leave Belgian territory \u2026 threat to public order\
  \ \u2026 a ban on entry for 3 (three) years is imposed\u201D."
