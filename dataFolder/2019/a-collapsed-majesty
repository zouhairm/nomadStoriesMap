Text: "My heart raced when I set foot in the ancient city of Sigiriya, as I laid eyes\
  \ on its imponent citadel for the first time. The paysage is, to say the least,\
  \ striking: surrounded by ruins of pools, gardens and fountains, an intricate palace\
  \ carved in a mighty rock, rising in solitude out of the Anuradhapura plain. I suspect\
  \ most that experience the joyful, adventurous, Indiana Jones movie atmosphere the\
  \ Citadel exudes today, its stairs teeming with noisy, curious schoolchildren, do\
  \ not align it with the notorious story behind its conception. Having previously\
  \ learned about it made this encounter all the more remarkable to me.\n\nAs is widely\
  \ known, it tells of the eldest son of king Dhatusena, prince Kashyapa, who, driven\
  \ by ambition, usurps his father of the throne and eventually assassinates him.\
  \ As a consequence, he became known as Pithru Ghathaka Kashyapa, or Kashyapa, the\
  \ Patrice, earning the animosity of his people and clergy. Fearing public rebellions\
  \ and retaliation by the rightful heir to the throne, prince Mogallana, Kashyapa\
  \ sought a new place for his capital and citadel. The majestic rock chosen provided\
  \ an unobstructed view of the proximities, allowing the king to prepare against\
  \ potential attackers; its near lion shaped structure, which King Kashyapa ordered\
  \ carved more elaborately to resemble the famous lion paws and extinct lion\u2019\
  s head, provided it its name \u2013 Sigiriya means \u201CLion Rock\u201D.\n\nAs\
  \ I climbed the first steps, I observed the surrounding structures: the monuments,\
  \ monastery complex components, such as the Bodhighara (Bodhi-tree Shrine), Image\
  \ House and ancient latrines set an ambience of reverence and holiness. I drew in\
  \ my mind a lively image of the ancient priests moving up and down those stairs\
  \ with their offerings, diligently in search of their nirvana. Then, I arrived at\
  \ the base of the Rock.\nThe following spiral staircase took me to the cave where\
  \ the famous king\u2019s concubines\u2019 frescoes \u2013 The Maidens of the Clouds\
  \ \u2013 are found. I was winded \u2013 under the scorching 1:00 pm sun, the climb\
  \ was somewhat straining at that point. However, any feeling of fatigue immediately\
  \ faded at the impeding sight \u2013 well preserved, lovely images of maidens gently\
  \ carrying flowers, garbed in vibrant colors and jewelry. Ingenuously crafted and\
  \ delicate, directly contrasting the with the energy of fortitude and power emanated\
  \ by the Rock, it seemed as if they existed to bring peace and balance to that place.\
  \ Peace and balance, I pondered, must have been precisely what King Kashyapa needed\
  \ during his relatively short reign, eventually ended in a coup carried out by prince\
  \ Mogallana \u2013 the delicacy of the frescoes and lavish structures surrounding\
  \ his Citadel certainly represented a refuge.\n\nClimbing the steps along the Mirror\
  \ Wall, which is said to have been so shiny that it could reflect one\u2019s face,\
  \ I proceeded to the entrance: although the previously existing head of the lion\
  \ above it is gone, the sensation of standing between its paws was incredibly empowering.\
  \ Once again, my mind transported me to the 5th century CE, depicting hundreds of\
  \ King Kashyapa\u2019s subjects walking through the mouth of the lion in hopes of\
  \ finding favor before the eyes of the King and of the gods.\n\nI kept climbing\
  \ the increasingly steep stairs, somewhat dehydrated and almost fatigued, until\
  \ I reached the summit of Lion\u2019s Rock. The view from the pinnacle, where King\
  \ Kashyapa\u2019s palace once sat, is marvelous: mountain peaks, lakes and an extensive\
  \ amount of green land compose an exotic and stunning landscape. I stood in awe\
  \ of the ancient boulder ponds and what were garden areas encircling the palace;\
  \ lastly, my imagination shaped the magnificent ambiance they unquestionably created\
  \ during the apex of the reign. I believe that I, for a minute, could feel what\
  \ King Kashyapa must have felt within his palace. Impenetrable, insuperable, majestic,\
  \ even as the course of history proved otherwise, as tragic as was his own ending\
  \ \u2013 laying into his own sword to avoid capture. As if I could touch the sky.\
  \ Unparalleled."
