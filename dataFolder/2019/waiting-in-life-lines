Text: "Each morning began with the sun peaking over the weathered buildings as I made\
  \ my way for the first-time down the narrow, uneven streets of Paris to enjoy a\
  \ cappuccino and warm baguette. From my patio seat, I watched the stylish Parisians\
  \ walking about their lives before setting out to explore the streets and boulevards\
  \ famous writers, painters, and artists had walked.  \n\nMy eager feet took me through\
  \ the blossoming Luxembourg Gardens, past Shakespeare & Company bookstore, over\
  \ Pont Notre Dame to my first cooking class where I would bake the baguette with\
  \ a true boulang\xE8re. Along the Seine, I strolled past Parisians and tourists\
  \ enjoying bottles of wine with the sun setting an orange and pink canvas behind\
  \ the Eiffel Tower in the distance. \n\nIt was on my fourth day, that I woke to\
  \ the tapping of rain drops on my balcony. The perfect day to visit The Centre Pompidou\u2019\
  s exhibit of Sheila Hick\u2019s \u201CLife Lines.\u201D Dodging the puddles along\
  \ Rue du Renard, the towering avant-garde structure of steel and glass tubes loomed\
  \ over as I made my way into the plaza. An architectural marvel I had not seen the\
  \ likes of before. \n\nMy mood instantly dampened seeing the line zigzag through\
  \ rows of roped corrals and stretch to the opposite end of the plaza. Having waited\
  \ in lines for days, I was tired of waiting, tired of removing my coat and bag,\
  \ of walking through metal detectors, only to wait in another line. \n\nWet and\
  \ irritated, I made my way through the crowd of tourists and past an armed soldier\
  \ to a nondescript caf\xE9. I would wait out the line with more espresso and another\
  \ baguette. \n\nUnder the covered patio, the museum\u2019s exterior steel beams\
  \ and modern structure seemed in direct opposition to the century old buildings\
  \ and homes I had passed. But as I ate, I began to see the beauty in the hard steel\
  \ lines that crisscrossed behind glass tubes. Tubes operating as a human conveyor\
  \ belt pulling further into a new artistic discovery. \n\nMy grey painting of a\
  \ modern-Paris icon covered in droplets of rain was interrupted as the soldier came\
  \ into view again. This time he was in a group. Five Ground Army soldiers in full\
  \ military gear \u2014 rifles across their bullet proof vest covered chests. Heads\
  \ constantly rotating side-to-side, they methodically walked through the plaza watching.\
  \ Growing up in the US I was not accustomed to soldiers patrolling the streets,\
  \ and so I watched with curious wonder as they disappeared around the corner and\
  \ out of sight. What were they looking for? \n\nRealizing the line had not diminished,\
  \ I admitted defeat and joined the others in the lightening drizzle. Moving closer\
  \ to the entry, my mind went back to the soldiers and a replay of the lines I found\
  \ myself shuffling through over the past few days. Lines that wrapped around street\
  \ corners and cramped roped off corrals leading to metal detectors. Confused tourists\
  \ trying to make sense of the equivalent of an airport security procedure, locals\
  \ waiting indifferently. Then it clicked \u2014 the metal detectors were there to\
  \ deter an attack. \n\nBack home the violence plays out on the television and computer\
  \ screens \u2014 bombings at concerts and museums, terrorists driving cars into\
  \ crowds, stabbings at caf\xE9s and on street corners. While we watch from a distance,\
  \ the rest of the world lives and waits within this unknown violent reality every\
  \ day. \n\nThe nuisance of waiting quickly washed away with the rain on the stone\
  \ plaza below my feet and the line began to move. I found myself inside, warm and\
  \ dry, slowly weaving through a kaleidoscope of colored yarn. \n\nAs the days went\
  \ on, I happily got lost wandering the streets of The Marais. Spent an afternoon\
  \ under the warm spring sun reading on a park bench and tasting my first macaron.\
  \ Stood under the Arc de Triumph at night while cars and motorbikes circled a mirage\
  \ of color around me. Line corrals and metal detectors soon forgotten in the colored\
  \ texture of life lines."
