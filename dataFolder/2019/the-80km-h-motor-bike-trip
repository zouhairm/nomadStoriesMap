Text: "80km/h speed on a motorbike with a stranger from a foreign country has never\
  \ been in my bucket list of crazy adventures.  \n\nMe and My friend decided to exchange\
  \ dollars to Tanzanian shillings when we\u2019re crossing borders by a bus from\
  \ Kenya to Tanzania. The driver stopped the bus and announced we got 10 mins. It\
  \ was lunch time. We went to the bank we found in-front of the restaurant and asked\
  \ for exchange. Few mins later I went outside to check on the bus. There was no\
  \ sign of our bus or any bus around. \n\nMe & My friend is alone in the middle of\
  \ a strange land. A man waving and running from the restaurant towards my direction\
  \ screamed \u201CYour Bus Left.\u201D \u201CNetsi \u201CI heard someone calling\
  \ my name and turn back to find Bex, our friend all frightened and relieved to see\
  \ me. \n\u201CWhere\u2019s Nina?\u201D he asked, \n\u201CShe is at the bank, Let\u2019\
  s go get her\u201D. We rushed to the bank and found Nina counting the exchanged\
  \ money. \u201Cwe are millionaires in Tanzania, Netsi\u201D. I laughed and told\
  \ her the Bus Left. She looked at me in shock. \u201Cyeah, so let\u2019s go out\
  \ and see our options\u201D Said Bex.\n\nWe got off the bank and the man lead us\
  \ to a small office next to the restaurant. We met a got, busy with the phone speaking\
  \ loud in Swahili. He explained the bus has stopped and is waiting for us. So we\
  \ need to take motorbikes to get there fast. \n\n\u2018MOTOR BIKE RIDE?? \u2019\
  Three motorbikes arrived instantly and the guy told them where to drop us. \n\n\
  One of the driver greet me with a smile and put a helmet on my head and helped me\
  \ get on the bike. He sat in front of me, pulled my hand and put them around his\
  \ waist, tapping on my fingers \u2013 I understand that he meant I should hold tight\
  \ and not let go at all. I showed him thumbs up as a sign that I have understood\
  \ what he meant. Crossed my hands and hold tight. He started the engine, didn't\
  \ waste a sec to get on the bumpy asphalt. He was riding like a Jet. We were going\
  \ faster than 80 km/h. Ohhhh Sweet Jesus; my heart was about to explode. I feel\
  \ my dreadlocks flying in the air. The speed breakers which were found in close\
  \ km were forcing the bike to Jump and fly in the middle of a traffic jammed street.\
  \ I got scared. I feel like we were going to roll over and crash against the cars.\
  \ The only thing I was able to hear was the air brushing against the cars left and\
  \ right whenever the motor bike passes by.\n\nI closed my eyes and covered my face\
  \ behind his back. I was feeling the movement while he was riding in spiral motion.\
  \ While holding tight I turn my neck and looked behind to check if my friends were\
  \ around. I saw Nina, she was terrified I can tell. After a long ride, we saw the\
  \ bus parked by the side of the road. Few people were standing outside. The guy\
  \ slowed down and smoothly stopped the bike close to the bus. I Jumped off the bike,\
  \ went to my purse and Paid 30000 shillings for three of us. smiled and said \u201C\
  Asante Sana\u201D ;(Thank you in Swahili), and they left. \n\nI feel so much alive.\
  \ Bex insist we look sad as everyone thought we were lost. Me and Nina instantly\
  \ put on our sad face and got into the bus. Everyone cheered and clapped; We both\
  \ smiled to the ones sitting in front and get to our seats and looked at each other\
  \ and high fived. We both had the best but unplanned and scariest adventure of our\
  \ life. Bex hand us over our lunch with a smirky smile and went back to his seat.\
  \ Rice and Chicken had never been so tasty. Never thought I would find the best\
  \ memory of my traveling life in the middle of a small town. I wish the motor bike\
  \ guy, know that I have found a lifelong experience to tell the world thanks to\
  \ him."
