Text: "July 2017, New York, USA\nI saw the Psychic Shop as I was heading back to my\
  \ hotel room. I was just from having the best ribs and cocktails at Dallas BBQ.\
  \ The thought had never crossed my mind but tonight it did. \u201CGo ahead! Let\u2019\
  s see what the future holds for you.\u201D Surprisingly, it wasn\u2019t that hard\
  \ of a choice to make. I found myself lying on my bed. Smiling. Knowing that this\
  \ was the beginning of something new. My mind had been opened and there was no turning\
  \ back. I didn\u2019t need a psychic to tell me what my future held. After all,\
  \ you don\u2019t have to know everything. All you have to do is take leap into the\
  \ unknown.\nFast forward to October 2018, China.\nThe USA undergraduate trip had\
  \ changed my perspective about the world. Since that trip my mind was set to exploring\
  \ the world and writing about it. I had read somewhere that Great writers have great\
  \ personal stories and this is what I was going for; to really live and have a story\
  \ to tell.\nThere I was; a 22 year old Kenyan girl with no clue about mandarin speaking\
  \ in the heart of China. This was just 2 months after my bachelor\u2019s graduation.\
  \ I had just turned down a permanent job in a big re-insurance company and taken\
  \ one year scholarship to study in Beijing. At this point, I was regretting not\
  \ visiting the psychic shop or was I\u2026\nMy school had a thing for trips and\
  \ just two months after enrolling they had organized a trip to Qingdao; a city in\
  \ China\u2019s Eastern Shandong Province; the loveliest city I had been to in 2018.\
  \ From the European style architecture to the southern china cuisine, to the friendly\
  \ people and let\u2019s not forget the coastal weather. It was divine.\nWe had tight\
  \ schedule with the school but we had the evenings to ourselves and that\u2019s\
  \ when the exploration would be done. If you want to have good memories, you have\
  \ to engage with the people of the city. That\u2019s exactly what my friends and\
  \ I did. \nOne night, we set off from our hotel rooms; took a cab to the center\
  \ of the city and started walking. The night was beautiful. Qingdao was lit up with\
  \ assorted colors everywhere and we did not feel alone. After walking for a while\
  \ ad hoping from different joints, we felt lost. A few minutes later, we were actually\
  \ lost. The night was getting colder and we couldn\u2019t find a cab. Just as we\
  \ were about to lose hope, we heard two loud male voices. We turned to look and\
  \ that\u2019s how we met Ed and John.\nEd and John. Two drunken Scottish males in\
  \ their mid-twenties who had left come to China to teach English. Ed made it clear\
  \ that this was his getaway plan and given how he\u2019s eyes shone brightly, I\
  \ think this get away was working for him. We had mastered the courage to ask the\
  \ two lads for directions and when they realized we were visitors in Qingdao, they\
  \ convinced us to walk around with them and allow them to show us great spots in\
  \ Qingdao. Forget everything our parents told us about interacting with strangers.\
  \ We agreed to go with. Talk about taking a leap into the unknown.\nWe went to the\
  \ most peculiar place. Believe it or not; it was an all pink ice cream shop with\
  \ an underground club. It felt like a secret mafia place. Ed just went to the ice\
  \ cream guy and said something to him then we signaled to go downstairs. This wasn\u2019\
  t just any club, it was a retro club with a weird room painted pink and had bean\
  \ bags where we just sat down and shared random stories. Did I mention we were the\
  \ only ones there; just us and two bar tenders. We were 5 strangers talking till\
  \ dawn. This is not where the story ends.\nI\u2019m set to graduate in June and\
  \ bid China goodbye but as David Bowie said, \u201CI don\u2019t know where am going\
  \ from here, but I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be boring.\u201D"
