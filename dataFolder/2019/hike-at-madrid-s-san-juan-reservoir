Text: "I have never been the sporty type, so ordinarily I would have turned down a\
  \ suggestion by my friend to go on a hike with a hiking group for travellers in\
  \ Madrid. However, keen to explore the country where I had recently arrived to spend\
  \ my university year abroad and to get to know like-minded people, I found myself\
  \ agreeing to the idea. \nWe arrived at the Madrid bus station bright and early,\
  \ equipped with walking shoes, swimming things and food. We were going to reservoir\
  \ San Juan, which was located 1 hour outside of Madrid. This was the first time\
  \ I had ventured outside of Madrid\u2019s city and its suburbs to a completely different\
  \ landscape. \nThe bus dropped us off at our destination, which was a dusty main\
  \ road with one lonely caf\xE9 stood opposite. How this could be the start of our\
  \ hiking route? We cautiously walked single-file down the road in the blazing heat.\
  \ Having reached the woodland area behind the road, everyone in the group introduced\
  \ themselves. I was pleased to discover there were many people who were in Madrid\
  \ to teach English like me. \nThe group leader looked at us sheepishly as he introduced\
  \ the next part of the hike. \u201CThis is going to be the most difficult part\u201D\
  \ he assured us, as he pointed to an almost 90-degree dusty slope beside us. I struggled\
  \ to hide the look of terror on my face. One by one we climbed this unexpected mountain;\
  \ my rucksack was so heavy against my back that I ended up half-crawling it, very,\
  \ very slowly as all my friends overtook me. Walking was never my thing, let alone\
  \ rock climbing. \nThe terrain was similar throughout the hike, and the 30-degree\
  \ sun was beating down on our necks as we trudged on. The thought that carried me\
  \ through was the promise of lunch and a refreshing swim in the elusive reservoir.\
  \ We helped one another clamber up particularly steep or rocky areas; it seemed\
  \ strange that just an hour ago most of us were strangers to each other. One rocky\
  \ slope had a small amount of barbed wire stretched across it and instead of turning\
  \ back as I expected, the leader advised us to carefully step over it. Was this\
  \ a genuine hiking route, or something this Spanish guy who we were all helplessly\
  \ trusting, had simply made up? \nWe gradually got closer to the shores as he said\
  \ gleefully \u201Cyou might find a few naturists along this stretch of beach\u201D\
  . We tiptoed past the nudist bathers and I wondered if anything on this trip could\
  \ surprise me anymore. Relief flooded my body as we saw a body of water emerge as\
  \ we looked down from the hill. After a ravenous munch of the food I had brought,\
  \ and some foreign snacks offered to me from travellers from various countries,\
  \ we treaded down through the rocks in our swimsuits to take the plunge into the\
  \ reservoir. I gasped with shock and delight as I swam through its ice-cold waters.\
  \ I was surprised at just how cold it was, given the beating rays of the warm Spanish\
  \ sun above us. \nThe walk back was mostly down-hill however it was even easier\
  \ to fall over on descent. We clung to each other\u2019s sweaty hands as we sidestepped\
  \ down in a long nervous line of wobbly, aching bodies. \nThe joy upon reaching\
  \ the lonely caf\xE9 was immense. We sat down at one long table and ordered jugs\
  \ of sangria to go around. The sangria tasted of Spain, summer and success. As we\
  \ got back on the bus to return to Madrid, the group leader congratulated us all,\
  \ particularly one girl, who had mild cerebral palsy and had fallen down several\
  \ times during the walk, gashing her legs all over.\nAs he checked she was alright,\
  \ she responded with such an overwhelming sense of positivity. She said, \u201C\
  If you fall down, you just get up again, no pasa nada\u201D. \nI found myself applying\
  \ these wise words to so many things during my year abroad, where I was presented\
  \ with new stumbling blocks every day. The important thing is the recovery, shaking\
  \ it off, NO PASA NADA."
