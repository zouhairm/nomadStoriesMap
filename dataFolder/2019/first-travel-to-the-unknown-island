Text: "it was yhe strangest place i've ever seen,but at the same time the most wonderful\
  \ and amazing one. \nwhat should i say first ? how can i describe this magical place?\n\
  \nthe pure nature and the green tall trees were standing like kings and the colorful\
  \ happy flowers  made this picturesque and fascinating scenery turn to a piece of\
  \ art and made this place breath-taking where you can throw all your problems and\
  \ forget about the past and start a new life . the sound was extremely relaxing\
  \ ,you can lay on the ground and let yourself be taken by the wonderful voice ofb\
  \ the differnt birds singing all the times that hamounious song with the calming\
  \ sound of the waterfalls .\n\non the other side of the island,were laying thousants\
  \ of yellow cristals forming the shining sand that was coverd in a big area by a\
  \ very vast brillant ocean.the view was perfectly unbelieveble . this golden sandy\
  \ beach was unforgettable and attractive that you will wish to spend the rest of\
  \ your life there !\nthen, i went to the biggest city there . i was astonished at\
  \ what i saw, this sparkling huge skyscarpers,these giant buildings,these magnificent\
  \ lightsand this wonderful view . What i have enjoyed the most was shopping .there\
  \ are lots of shops where you can buy clothes and antiques .there are also hundred\
  \ of markets not too far from the center of the city that sell everything you can\
  \ imagine: food,clothes,music, furniture and jewelerry  you can also buy exiting\
  \ things like old clothes and antiques. it is very popular,dynamic and cilorful\
  \ place. i loved it so much!\nHow can i forget the streets wich sound like festivals\
  \ where you can find all types of performance : music,theatre and circus performances\
  \ . THAT'S VERY AMASZING !\npeople there were very kind,cheerful and friendly .They\
  \ love to talk about their country, they live in a simple way, they are hard-workers\
  \ they love each others and live in harmony together.\nAt the end of this wonderful\
  \ trip, i was crying and i didn't wanted to leave this place .But, When i retourned\
  \ I irrefutably released that nothing has changed me more than this travel : i had\
  \ fun and i learnt at the same time how to love life and appreciate what i have,\
  \ and of course that travelling is the only thing you buy and makes you rich!"
