Text: "January 12th, 2018\n\n\u201CWhy are we having all these people from shithole\
  \ countries come here?\u201D \n\t\nDonald Trump\u2019s latest one-liner blared from\
  \ the airport TV before my flight to Italy. \u201CHe really tells it like it is\u201D\
  , I thought, reassuring myself that I had made the right choice in November 2016.\
  \ Boarding the TUIFly aircraft, with an English-teaching internship waiting for\
  \ me on the other side of the ocean, the President\u2019s remark made the worldwide\
  \ prestige of my brand new American passport manifest.\n\nJanuary 6th, 2019\n\n\
  Two hours of sleep were my sole consolation for the two-day journey ahead of me.\
  \ Thank God for the Uber driver. His conversation managed to keep me from collapsing\
  \ into the front passenger seat. It turns out that there is a new wave of people\
  \ that drive cabs on the side just to practice their English with foreigners. Once\
  \ I arrived, the \u201CAutogara Militar\u0103\u201D Bus Station of Bucharest contradicted\
  \ its official-sounding name. Before me was a compact wasteland; dirt, gravel and\
  \ a small ticket office were surrounded by a fence. The fleet of buses filled in\
  \ the rest of the canvas, and at the foot of each vehicle waited lines of middle-aged\
  \ Romanians. They were armed with bags filled with jams, cheese, cakes, and sausages.\
  \ It sounds like the preparation for a bucolic picnic, but the reality of the scene\
  \ could kill anyone\u2019s appetite. \n\nThis was the latest batch of long-term\
  \ workers returning to France, Italy, or Spain after the Christmas holidays, to\
  \ work as cleaners, masons, and caregivers for the elderly. I was in Romania on\
  \ a visa-run after overstaying the Italian residence permit stamped on my triumphant\
  \ passport. The possibility of being seized for deportation by the Hungarian custom\
  \ officers upon reentry into the Schengen Area terrified me, but my compassion for\
  \ these people neutralized this anxiety. Days before, they had been celebrating\
  \ New Year\u2019s Eve with their families, and suddenly, they were off again, to\
  \ toil for another half a year in Padua, Marseille, or Barcelona, just to send home\
  \ a few thousand Euros so their kids can finally cook with a stove instead of a\
  \ chimney. As I found a seat on the bus, my attitude began to change. Most of my\
  \ fellow travelers were at least twenty years my seniors, and many of them would\
  \ spend two more days than me on the road. Surely my youth could lend me the strength\
  \ to weather the ride with the same grace as them? \n\nLacking books to read on\
  \ my journey, the landscapes of the Carpathian Mountains were a perfect replacement.\
  \ Everyone else on board was breaking bread and smearing it with the aforementioned\
  \ sausages, guzzling home-made wine from repurposed mineral water bottles. If this\
  \ conviviality hadn\u2019t been enough, most of them seemed to have a CD player,\
  \ and they all took turns playing their favorite folk fiddle tunes through a kind\
  \ of rural democracy that was more crowd-pleasing than any Spotify playlist. \n\t\
  \nThe snowy peaks transformed into the semi-arid Carpathian plains, and as we neared\
  \ Hungary, the smell of the sausages mocked me and reminded me why I was riding\
  \ the bus back to Italy instead of flying there. I was strapped for cash; the internship\
  \ money dried up. \n\nWe made our final Romanian stop in the outskirts of Arad,\
  \ to switch buses. This station made the one in Bucharest look like an oasis. Upon\
  \ setting foot on the gravel, the dreary horde of migration swarmed my sight: chickens,\
  \ Roma women with colorful dresses and headscarves, and wrinkly sunburned men hauling\
  \ boxes. Whiffing this desperation made my inability to purchase food at the stall\
  \ with my almost maxed-out credit card all the more frustrating. Next to me, one\
  \ of the wrinkly men lit a cigarette, so searching for some physical solace, I asked\
  \ for one. He indulged me without reservations and observing my 60-liter backpack,\
  \ he asked where I came from. \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re American!? \u2026What are you\
  \ doing in this shithole!?\u201D \n\nShithole\u2026 \n \t \nThe smoke of that cigarette\
  \ tasted like the flame of cosmic justice equalizing me, the prestigious American\
  \ English teacher, with that against which I voted, the migrating manual laborer.\n\
  \nKarma\u2019s just like Trump.\n\n It \u201Creally tells it like it is\u201D."
