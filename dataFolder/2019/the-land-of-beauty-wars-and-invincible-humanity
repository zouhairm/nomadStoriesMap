Text: "More than five decades of the post-colonial tug-of-war between India and Pakistan\
  \ had left Kashmir ever-so-vulnerable. Yet this land retained a strange kind of\
  \ pristine and fearless beauty. I traveled to this wonderland in the year when a\
  \ deadly earthquake with an epicenter in Pakistan had scarred this region. For the\
  \ longest time before that, I had known this land through Indian movies on wars\
  \ and terrorism. Finally, I made a real journey to discover Kashmir in the ruins\
  \ of political turbulence and natural disaster.  \n\nI remember the first time I\
  \ laid my eyes on its beauty. On a crisp and cold October morning, a jeep carrying\
  \ ten of us from Jammu to Srinagar halted by the Dal Lake. I got down and stared\
  \ at the sparkling blue waters. That exotic blue was unlike anything I had seen\
  \ before. The sun poured down on the snow-capped mountains in the horizon spreading\
  \ a surreal glow. As I took my eyes off nature, I suddenly got conscious of my surroundings.\
  \ This was the region of the subcontinent so close to a war-zone, and someone had\
  \ been murdered in the Lal Chowk in Srinagar that day. Awe over natural beauty almost\
  \ overcame our trepidation as we took a ferry to our houseboat in the Lake.\n\n\
  Rehman, the caretaker, and cook of our houseboat welcomed us, smiling widely. Since\
  \ that moment, he provided all the delicacies without deliberation and wearing that\
  \ smile. The sweetness of this native could not right away relieve us from the unease\
  \ of being near the border surrounded by people from another religion. In the face\
  \ of wars and obsession over lands or Gods, ancient nomads often distrusted their\
  \ own kin. We have progressed little from there. Despite this disquiet, we enjoyed\
  \ the royal comforts up to the brim. The houseboat was worn out by the passage of\
  \ time yet it was impeccable in providing all the luxury. There, in the midst of\
  \ antique pieces of furniture, grand chandeliers, perfect crockeries filled with\
  \ delicious food, we found our temporary home. \n\nI cannot recall precisely when\
  \ I fell in love with the people in the northernmost tip of my country, I really\
  \ knew little about. Maybe, it was about the ever-smiling vibe of Rehman, or the\
  \ warmth of the boatmen,  or the fresh flowers that women carried in their ferries,\
  \ or the little boys with horses in Sonmarg, or the innocence of this land I unconsciously\
  \ assumed to be non-existent.  \n\nOn one of the mornings, we had taken a trip down\
  \ the lake in shikaras (the boats decorated in colorful curtains and similar to\
  \ Venetian Gondolas).  I asked the boatman,\n\u201CDid you get affected by the earthquake?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CYes, look at the broken pieces of land there.\u201D\nThere were disoriented\
  \ houses in the regions he pointed at. Women in colorful dupattas were pursuing\
  \ chores like carrying wooden logs and utensils. They were beautiful beyond words.\
  \ They were happily building up their lives from scratch. Destruction. Reconstruction.\
  \ The cycle of life. They have learned to steer through it the hard way. Yet, they\
  \ remained mellow inside. The spirit of life remains indomitable in this wonderland.\n\
  \nOn the final evening, we were invited for dinner in a local Kashmiri-Muslim household.\
  \ Two men from that family drove us to their place. In the dead hours of the evening,\
  \ as our cars speeded up tearing through the Srinagar mist, I wouldn't lie, we were\
  \ nervous. We were unsettled somewhere deep down as we entered their home. We sat\
  \ in their living room, while one of them came in with a traditional kettle containing\
  \ water and washed our hands lovingly. Then what followed was a grand feast. The\
  \ oldest member of the family sat in front of us, asking now and then, \"Do you\
  \ need anything more?\"\n\nDid we?\nThe old woman blabbered, \"We don't want to\
  \ be a part of India.\" They may not want to be Indians, but they did not forget\
  \ to love the Indians.  They did not forget to be kind. \n\nThirteen years passed\
  \ since I made that journey to discover humanity in the uncharted territories. Not\
  \ a day passes when I forget the universality of kindness and the insatiable spirit\
  \ to live."
