Text: "Berlin. Such a unique and historical city. It is clean, dirt cheap and oh so\
  \ different to any European City that I have ever been to before!\P\n\nWhat to do\
  \ now? Grab a cuppa, relax and read about my travels in a city that swept me off\
  \ my feet.\P\n\nHistorically, divided into two by the Berlin Wall, the city is now\
  \ an allure for the creative mind. Art, technology, alcohol and food is a large\
  \ part of the culture that features in Berlin. As well as this, it features beautiful\
  \ green spaces, rivers and archaic building's that really bring out the historical\
  \ side of the city and what it has gone through in the past.\n\nTo begin my travels,\
  \ I took a stroll through history, past and present, to the Jewish Holocaust Memorial.\P\
  \P \PTo look at it, it just seems to be a large amount of grey stones of different\
  \ shapes and sizes, right? However, the message of this memorial is that the stones\
  \ represent a graveyard of the Jew's who died during the Holocaust - however this\
  \ is open to interpretation. When walking through these stones, the ground seems\
  \ to rise and fall again, you are towering over the stones and then suddenly the\
  \ stones are towering over you. According to the Architect who designed this, Peter\
  \ Eisenman, this is an illusion to make you feel lost and confused. The uneasy atmosphere\
  \ is supposed to make you feel like a Jew during hiding in the war - that you have\
  \ lost touch with humanity.\P \n\nFrom this, I continued onto the Brandenburg Gate\
  \ - which is full of Tourist's - so I grabbed a photo and left. It was pretty and\
  \ worth the visit don't worry. And literally opposite the Brandenburg Gate is The\
  \ Reichstag. Germany's Parliament.\P\n\nThe Reichstag is FULL of history. Obviously\
  \ with an interest in Politics, this was a no brainer to visit. The 360 degree views\
  \ from the top of this historical building is outstanding, giving you a birds-eye\
  \ view of the full city.\P\P \n\nCheckpoint Charlie and Topography of Terror were\
  \ my afternoon activities, after sitting down to enjoy a fine lunch of a Currywurst\
  \ - a sausage with curry on, pretty much. It defiantly has a acquired taste I'll\
  \ tell you that!\P\n\nCheckpoint Charlie provides information of the history of\
  \ East and West Berlin, Post World War Two. With plaque cards full of information\
  \ about Germany in the time of the late 1940's and early 50's, if you are interested\
  \ in the history of the war, it's a must on the Berlin Bucket List!\P \n\nHaving\
  \ an interest in the War may also sway you towards visiting the Topography of Terror,\
  \ a museum which displays information and facts about the SS and SA during the war,\
  \ including their leader's, policy's and terror factors.\P\n\nAfter a few too many\
  \ Stein's the previous evening, I started off the next morning with a very insightful\
  \ and eye opening tour of a World War Two Bunker, which is hidden within the Subway\
  \ Station of Gesundrunnen. \PThe Tour gives you an insight into what life was like\
  \ as a German Citizen living in Berlin during the war. You learn what the air raid's\
  \ where like that destroyed up to 80% of Berlin and see artefacts from survivors\
  \ and what have been found in rubble, all with their own unique story behind them.\P\
  \n\nOn a lighter note, for a leisurely afternoon activity, I visited the Berlin\
  \ Zoo - which is the largest Zoo in Europe! It had a varied amount of different\
  \ animals and species that was such an amazing experience to see them all.\P \n\n\
  As I still had some time at the end of the day, I travelled across to the East Side\
  \ Gallery, also known as the Berlin Wall. The Wall was full of Urban art and influential\
  \ painting's, which was amazing to see as you walk up the side of it and gaze in\
  \ awe at the outstanding art that is plastered across the wall.\P\nWho would think\
  \ that something so historic and meaningful could turn into an urban, artistic canvas\
  \ for thousands to enjoy?\P\P \n\nBerlin, you have my heart."
