Text: "Personal circumstances led me to set time aside for travel in the Autumn of\
  \ 2018. It's something I had long planned to do. Music is my first passion but travel\
  \ comes a close second. Canada was to be the main focus of my attention, but not\
  \ my first port of call.\n\nA friend, who we'll call Mary, lives in Iceland and\
  \ had been very vocal that I should visit. It didn't cost a great deal more to stop\
  \ over for a few days and it seemed like an opportunity to be seized. From the second\
  \ I saw the eerie, lunar-looking landscapes as the plane made its descent into Reykjavik,\
  \ I knew I was in for an experience. I wasn't disappointed. After a pleasant start\
  \ sampling hot springs and some live music, Mary slipped and fell, breaking her\
  \ wrist.\n\nIt was an unfortunate, even ominous start, but I was undeterred. After\
  \ some polite but firm enquiries at the airport as to the purpose of my visit to\
  \ Canada, which was not as straightforward to explain as you might imagine, I was\
  \ on my way to Toronto. I'd been before, but had been intrigued enough by the city's\
  \ creative milieu to investigate further. It was a sort of pilgrimage.\n\nI was\
  \ staying with friends, although they were away a lot and I had plenty of time to\
  \ myself. I got to know the city; riding subways, streetcars and buses, seeking\
  \ out arty nooks and crannies and as much live music as I could. I went to many\
  \ open mic nights, where I found a warm reception and a sense of community. I spent\
  \ time writing, practicing and recording. On one memorable occasion, by chance I\
  \ met a friend from home who was on a streetcar going the opposite direction. On\
  \ a trip to Montreal, I made an acquaintance that blossomed into a lasting friendship.\n\
  \nApart from self-reliance, I learned to be more spontaneous. I saw that an musician\
  \ I had admired for years was playing in New York. With little hesitation, I booked\
  \ bus tickets to go. It was a long and grueling journey, but I did not regret it.\
  \ Apparently astonished that anyone would go to that trouble, he set time aside\
  \ to hang out. We talked a lot and became friends, something I would not have believed\
  \ possible before.\n\nAs the novelty of Toronto's bright lights began to fade, my\
  \ imminent return trip to New York became more alluring. I was going to do it 'properly'\
  \ this time. By a happy coincidence, a good friend from home, Eileen, was visiting\
  \ family in the Bronx. I was only too glad to see a familiar face. Fate, however,\
  \ had its own ideas. A niggling pain in my tooth prompted a trip to a budget dentist.\
  \ I was ambushed by three nurses as I left the chair, demanding an extra $75 on\
  \ top of the agreed $25. I escaped with my wallet and jaw intact, thanks only to\
  \ Eileen's shrewd negotiations.\n\nAs exciting as NYC had been, my tooth sealed\
  \ the deal. It was time to go home. And yet, there were still surprises in store.\
  \ I had arranged to visit Mary again on the way home but I had a few days to put\
  \ in first. Happily, 'my' room in Toronto was available. Being short on inspiration\
  \ and weary from traveling, it offered a welcome familiarity. On my very last day\
  \ there, I finally tracked down another musician I had long been a fan of. We hit\
  \ it off straight away, and spent a leisurely Sunday afternoon talking, having lunch,\
  \ playing pool and drinking beers, like old pals. We planted the seeds of future\
  \ collaboration. Having been glad to get out of the city only weeks prior, I was\
  \ now sad to leave it.\n\nBy the time I got to Iceland, Mary's wrist was almost\
  \ better. Just out of her cast, we were able to do the hiking and swimming we had\
  \ postponed. In the time I'd been away and she'd been off work, she met her new\
  \ boyfriend. The effects ripple on - friendships, collaborations, relationships\
  \ and more than anything, possibility. I really wasn't expecting\u2026any of that.\
  \ Perhaps I will now."
