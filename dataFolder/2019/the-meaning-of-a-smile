Text: "'Making a local connection'\n\nMy footsteps march in time to the beating of\
  \ the blood in my ears. I know that I should be relieved, but all I can feel right\
  \ now is foolish.\L\n\nFoolish to have scraped my knee in that impromptu touch rugby\
  \ game. Foolish to have not carried an extra bandage.\n\nI pound the last few metres\
  \ of pavement that extends from the huge hospital and enter the bustle of the street.\n\
  \nFoolish to have stood in the yard of that orphanage we visited. \nFoolish to have\
  \ looked away from that dog the kids were playing with.\n\nThe cacophony from the\
  \ motorbike taxi pilots dies down as I depart the depot. Confusion reigns as the\
  \ pallid \u2018mzungu\u2019 steps out of Moshi, Tanzania\u2019s White Man hospital\
  \ and into the surrounding land where he is seldom seen.\n\n\tFoolish to have covered\
  \ my graze just a second too late. \nFoolish to have put myself in the position\
  \ of needing a series of rabies shots in my first month in Africa.\n\nWell, I\u2019\
  ve had my shots. They didn\u2019t come cheap. A month\u2019s spending money down\
  \ the drain; I can only hope that the extra 20 doses for which I was charged get\
  \ distributed to those who need them the most.\n\nI had arrived at the hospital\
  \ in luxury, left foot toasty warm from the exhaust of the buzzy bike I had ridden.\
  \ \n\nWell, that was then and this is now. I\u2019m in cash saving mode. No, Mr\
  \ Taxi Man, I can walk just fine, thank you very much.\n\nA dreadlocked Real Madrid\
  \ supporter eyes me furtively as he disappears into a building. Along I stride,\
  \ mental mathematic acrobatics in overdrive as I figure out which way I should be\
  \ heading.\n\nCrash, smash, bash! Limbs falling from the huge ancestral tree towering\
  \ over me block the path. Point taken, I think to the tiny figures clinging way\
  \ up high. I\u2019ll find another route.\n\nI turn back and the Real Madrid supporter\
  \ is waiting. He seems a different man, eyes red and teeth grinding. \u201CMoney,\
  \ just a little money\u2026\u201D\n\nI duck past his clutching hands as if I was\
  \ part of El Cl\xE1sico and race off up the path.\n\nWalking home in a foreign land?\
  \ What was going through my mind? This sun has turned my brain to mush. Moshi mush.\
  \ \n\nEyes up. On the path ahead of me rises a bristling mishmash of teeth and bad\
  \ intentions. Uh oh. What is this beast? The original Moshi Monster?\n\nI take a\
  \ hint, turn tail and take off out of there.\n\nThe horizon yields a speck. Fuelled\
  \ by my curiosity and lengthening stride, this blossoms into a smudge, unfolds to\
  \ form a box, and blooms into a roadside stall.\n\nSheepish I approach, smiling\
  \ the smile that transcends language and culture and signals that a human is in\
  \ need of another. A smile that somehow acknowledges the ludicrousness of a situation\
  \ but simultaneously begs pardon, winks new acquaintance into co-conspiracy and\
  \ promises better days for all.\n\nThe beauty of a smile was re-written that day\
  \ on the outskirts of Moshi Shanty Town. A full set of fangs as advertised by Colgate\
  \ and Crest and Moshi Street Dog #73 never seemed so ghastly. In their place glowed\
  \ the gums of God, creased lips giving way to pure kindness. Human eyes, so often\
  \ narrowed in judgement, cannot resist crinkling closed by such a smile, because\
  \ true kindness knows no use for shallow sight.\n\nA stuttered question and some\
  \ hand gestures follow; before long, I am on my way down the road which will lead\
  \ me to my friends.\n\nIt is natural to fear the unknown; suspicious animals, we\
  \ emerged from the Continent and spread our wings around this earth because of the\
  \ respectfully wide berth we paid to Mother Earth and our fellow creatures. To bring\
  \ a stranger into one\u2019s world, to truly make them feel at home, is the greatest\
  \ present one can give. Leaping shadows become dappled sunshine; hooded figures\
  \ become friendly pilgrims. A perilous maze? A friendly village!\n\nThis may be\
  \ a morning I will never forget; but this connection to a local I will certainly\
  \ always remember."
