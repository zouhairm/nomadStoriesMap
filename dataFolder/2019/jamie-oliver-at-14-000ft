Text: "I had accompanied my partner on the 10-day hike from Lukla to Mount Everest\
  \ Base Camp. The 6 day climb had been difficult, but our wonderful sherpa and in-house\
  \ comedian Nirmal made it easier luring me up the steep hills with the promise of\
  \ carrot cake. \n\nWe had reached the final guest house Gorak Shep, and the final\
  \ walk to Base Camp was not the dramatic hike I had envisioned. After a slow climb\
  \ over glaciers and snow-covered rocks, I had an unpleasant experience when I ventured\
  \ behind a large boulder serving as an alfresco lavatory when I stepped into what\
  \ the local hiking committee calls \u2018the poo pit\u2019. Even as the Nepalese\
  \ government begins to enforce a strict littering ban, there was nothing to stop\
  \ the wads of toilet paper and ominous stains stashed in the snow. \n\nShuffling\
  \ in a line, our sherpa following in our steps making jokes about yellow and brown\
  \ snow, I encountered one of the dreaded risks of high-altitude climbing: altitude\
  \ sickness. My partner began to sway in his step, not unlike a drunk navigating\
  \ the hallway of his house. He was soon unable to walk in a straight line.\n\nReturning\
  \ to the guest house, it became clear we would have to evacuate to Kathmandu in\
  \ style: in a helicopter. Nirmal was the most excited about the evacuation. His\
  \ friend had had the same issue with American tourists and he was incredibly jealous\
  \ that his friend now had a wonderful Facebook profile photo in a helicopter. \n\
  \nUnfortunately for Nirmal\u2019s Facebook profile, the weather in the mountains\
  \ cares not for the troubles of men and had decided to throw a blizzard at our rickety\
  \ guesthouse in Gorak Shep. The helicopter would be delayed by three days.\n\nMy\
  \ partner was confined to the guesthouse bed. Wrapped in a sleeping bag with just\
  \ his face poking through, his breath came in rugged lurches. Suffering from a severe\
  \ case of altitude sickness and a suspected cerebral oedema, he had been unable\
  \ to leave the bed for almost 24 hours and no longer had the energy to speak.\n\n\
  Even though it well beyond midday, days spent in the shadow of the highest mountain\
  \ in the world seem to never truly begin. Whether it was because the temperature\
  \ barely reached 10 degrees or whether the high altitude affects the senses, it\
  \ seemed as though I was permanently in that tenuous stage of pre-coffee morning.\
  \ I sat around the small fire in the guest house. The only occupants were my napping\
  \ sherpa, my incapacitated partner, and a small village boy whose only job was to\
  \ monitor the fire and prepare simple meals.\n\nI sat in contemplative silence.\
  \ I had found a battered climbers\u2019 guide in the corner of the guesthouse that\
  \ informed me that if my partner was suffering from HACE (high altitude cerebral\
  \ oedema) he would not live past 48 hours. \n\nThe little village boy was busy preparing\
  \ some food in the makeshift corner, throwing surreptitious glances my way from\
  \ across the fire from me. As one of the ethnic groups native to the mountainous\
  \ regions of Nepal, his biology and age left his immune to the effects of high altitude.\
  \ \nAs I gazed into the fire he brought over a small bowl of steaming \u2018sherpa\
  \ stew,\u2019 a mystery dish crafted from spare ingredients. Taking the soup from\
  \ him, I murmured my thanks and warmed my hands on the bowl. \nA soft voice made\
  \ me jump.\n\u201CJamie Oliver,\u201D the boy said. \nI stared, had I too succumbed\
  \ to the high altitude? \n\u201CJamie Oliver,\u201D he repeated, pointing at my\
  \ bowl. \u201CI love his cooking, I want to cook like him\u201D. \nI looked down\
  \ into the bowl and saw something that astonished me. \nAmong all the mystery vegetables\
  \ and languid noodles sat a single stalk of coriander, placed with the care and\
  \ tenderness of a television chef. \n\nAt an elevation of 5,000m above sea level,\
  \ where even survival is questionable, where your carefully packed wet wipes freeze\
  \ and turn into a useless solid block and avalanches are the norm, I would never\
  \ have expected to find a Jamie Oliver fan.\n\nThat soup bowl was the most enjoyable\
  \ meal you could imagine."
