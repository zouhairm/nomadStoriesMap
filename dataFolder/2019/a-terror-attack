Text: "I cannot imagine myself in a more awful yet interesting place than Varanasi.\
  \ It is one of the oldest cities in India and the holiest city of Hinduism. Varanasi\
  \ is also considered as Shiva\u2019s favorite city which he never leaves. Above\
  \ Varanasi hovers a mixed mist of smoke and fumes, so that at night no stars can\
  \ be seen. The narrow streets are littered with garbage and feces, and cows, pigs,\
  \ dogs and monkeys are roaming around. Drug dealers and pimps are standing near\
  \ the Ghats, the stairs leading to the Ganges, looking out for tourists to scam.\n\
  \nMany religious people come here simply to die, to be cremated on the banks of\
  \ the Ganges, before the ashes will be handed over to the river.\n\nThey say, this\
  \ way it is possible to break out of the cycle of birth and rebirth. The city is\
  \ full of sick people waiting for death.\n\nOne evening we had gathered together\
  \ to visit a so-called Puja on the Ganges. It is traditionally Hindu ceremony in\
  \ Varanasi. Suddenly in the midst of the ceremony a bomb exploded. One child died,\
  \ many people were injured. According to the newspaper Hindustan Times a terror\
  \ organization called Indian Mudschaheddin confessed to this attack."
