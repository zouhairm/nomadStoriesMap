Text: "A bit about me: I was born in New Zealand along with my mother and father however,\
  \ their parents were from a small island in the pacific called - Samoa. A country\
  \ which to parts of the western world can seem to have a few things backward such\
  \ as; it is traditional for children to take on their fathers first name as their\
  \ last name instead of their fathers last name; or that the history of Samoa was\
  \ never recorded on paper but recorded through song and stories. These sorts of\
  \ things interest me!\nWhy? Because I am a musician , opera singer , animal lover\
  \ who has travelled the world telling stories in all languages. Stories of my life,\
  \ stories of other people\u2019s lives, stories of old and of the unknown. I was\
  \ told stories as a child, and now I am telling stories as an adult. C\u2019est\
  \ la vie! \n\nStories. \nSince the beginning of time, we have told and retold stories\
  \ to help connect us humans. Myths and legends have proved that we are notorious\
  \ for adding our own flavourings and spices because well, everybody loves a good\
  \ story. The story of who I am was first told to me by my mother and father, which\
  \ was in fact their mother and fathers story plus their own seasoning. Ha! But then\
  \ one day it all hits you and you realise that you have a choice, to live the story\
  \ you\u2019ve been taught, or live the story the way you want to retell it. Bingo.\
  \ \n\nQuestions such as how I came to be called by my name, or where did my funny\
  \ nose come from? These are all fundamentals to creating the story you wish to identify\
  \ with in order to communicate with your fellow humans. I say fellow humans because\
  \ it seems to break down the barriers of culture, time and language - not that they\u2019\
  re not important - but understanding that so many stories are created and retold\
  \ in all corners of the world in all languages is so exciting!! \n\nWhat else excites\
  \ me? Food , Wine and Music! These three languages (along with a little cheek and\
  \ curious wit) can take you to the most extraordinary parts of the world. And of\
  \ course these are TASTIEST when shared.\n\nMy proposition: I find myself travelling\
  \ and retelling stories all the time to friends and crowds alike. But my proposition\
  \ is this - My side kick cousin is Kiwi Italian but speaks many of the European\
  \ languages. He cooks, he works as a sommelier on Waiheke Island, he sings, but\
  \ most importantly - he loves life. I myself speak English and Italian and also\
  \ share the love for languages especially given my profession. The two of us are\
  \ dynamite in a room, in any given situation.\n\nWe would create stories and retell\
  \ them in our own words to share with people, to excite them and to open their eyes\
  \ to the word of other cultures. We aren\u2019t the type to be deep in night clubs\
  \ from dusk to dawn, nor are we the type to be found sitting inside all day. Our\
  \ main passion is people. Without people there are no stories. No one to share the\
  \ memories with, and no one to share the stories to. Hence why my proposition includes\
  \ my side kick. Because after years of travelling and tasting the wonders of the\
  \ world, a story is SO much more when shared. \n\nI am a current ambassador for\
  \ the All Blacks Tours heading to Tokyo for the 2019 Rugby World Cup to do exactly\
  \ this. If world Nomads were interested in throwing around some ideas for later\
  \ this year, we would love to talk!! \n\nAll the best,\n\nMoses"
