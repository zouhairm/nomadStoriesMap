Text: "Don\u2019t get me wrong, California will forever be my home but my travel history\
  \ has been Disneyland, San Francisco, and various beach towns within the confines\
  \ of the golden state. I knew that I didn\u2019t know what I was missing and the\
  \ only way to find out was to go out and see for myself. At 20 years old, I had\
  \ been living in Los Angeles working on a BA in Screenwriting at Loyola Marymount\
  \ University for two years all while maintaining a long distance relationship. In\
  \ April of last year, I broke up with him which included scrapping my summer plans\
  \ to live with him in San Francisco. I panicked over where I would go: either back\
  \ in my hometown, Sacramento, or stay in Los Angeles where I wouldn\u2019t be bored\
  \ out of my mind. Within the week, I secured a place to sublease in Los Angeles\
  \ for the summer but, there was a two-week gap between my on-campus housing and\
  \ the last day of the month; I did what any broke, travel-hungry college student\
  \ wants to do: booked the cheapest stay in New York City. The glimmer of the big\
  \ apple and the chic Brooklyn aesthetic attracted me East Coast because of all the\
  \ things California lacked. Honestly, it\u2019s the people in Los Angeles. There\u2019\
  s this understood difference between Los Angeles and New York: LA is beautiful arrangement\
  \ of smoke and mirrors but lacks authenticity while NY has the genuine aspect along\
  \ with a whimsically gritty feel. After seeing NYC, I couldn\u2019t deny the truth\
  \ in the comparison. \n\nThe most memorable part of NYC, classically, was Central\
  \ Park. Central Park is New York\u2019s adult playground and since I have seen my\
  \ fair share of movies, I cannot help but love the fantastical quality of being\
  \ on the film set of many classics. My first full day in New York I spent at the\
  \ Northern part of Central Park starting at Lenox Avenue. In July, the rain came\
  \ down consistently and bearable as I scaled south to the Met. The sidewalks were\
  \ lightly packed with people. The grass and Harlem Meer stood still calmly letting\
  \ the polite come down. I felt like an outsider looking in on a secret about New\
  \ York on a day most chose to stay inside. \n\nTraveling alone felt natural but\
  \ I understand not everyone likes to be alone especially in a place unknown. The\
  \ year before, I had not thought I would\u2019ve travelled across the country by\
  \ myself but there was something inside of me that knew I needed to do it.  I saw\
  \ New York City to the beat of my psychedelic, R&B walking music and finally had\
  \ the space form California I needed. With my 35mm Nikon in hand, I searched for\
  \ the city\u2019s visual nuances with my rolls of ammo. \n\nOn my last day, Central\
  \ Park concluded my trip. This time, I started on the southern side where I worked\
  \ my way up. Street performers sprinkled the sides of the pathways near the low\
  \ rolling hills on either side. New York City had so much greenery which added the\
  \ authenticity I\u2019d been craving. Tourists and locals alike strolled the paths\
  \ in the golden muggy sunshine of New York\u2019s summer. The park has this indescribable\
  \ allure that made me feel I truly could wander the park forever and that if I did\
  \ long enough,  I would one day understand the mystics that lie in the park.\nI\
  \ charmingly kept a journal for this trip and I re-read it to write this. On the\
  \ second day I wrote \u201CNew York seems like magic. I don\u2019t think that feeling\
  \ will last\u2026\u201D which was not true. Through and through, the city surprised\
  \ me and although I do not think I could live there for longer than a few months,\
  \ I would like to get the know the city better like I would a raunchy, yet charismatic\
  \ friend I met one time, briefly. New York is somewhere I\u2019d like to go with\
  \ money to blow; my broke situation was never truly forgotten. But I loved the plain\
  \ fact of just being there and seeing the people, the architecture and experience\
  \ the tranquility in traveling alone."
