Text: "What can a name tell you? Boa? I heard nothing for the first time. From the\
  \ small airport to the small town with six districts, I finally realize isolated\
  \ can be this amazing. My team was arrived around eight in the morning. After settled\
  \ our bags down, we were heading to Boa with a truck which local people use for\
  \ transferring pigs from one town to another. I saw various of ecosystem, one place\
  \ was like savanna and the next one was like grass land. Horses, cows, and lambs\
  \ gathered around to enjoy their meal, while we tried to hold back our food. The\
  \ truck was literally a roller coaster with local taste. Trough the narrow road,\
  \ with no many vehicles, anyone can drive like on the race. That was probably what\
  \ the driver felt. \nLiving for 22 years old, being Indonesia citizen, little did\
  \ I know about isolated city, like Rote Ndao and Boa. We were warmly welcomed by\
  \ local people. For the next five days, we stayed at the elementary school. There\
  \ was a well in the yard, and two bathrooms in the back yard. Not just the local\
  \ people, but pigs were coming to say hi too. In front of our simple-but-memorable\
  \ hostel, a beautiful beach lied with no end. I remember before coming home from\
  \ cassava farm, we stopped at the beach to enjoy the glorious sunset.\nIt was a\
  \ voluntary program. I was part of the environment team. We set three programs related\
  \ to Boa's environment issues.  One of the program was making cattle manure. So,\
  \ we were heading to the grass land across the school where the horses, pigs, and\
  \ cows spending most of their time eating. Still stuck on my mind, when we were\
  \ waiting those cattle to poop, under the coconut trees. Walking around with sacks\
  \ on our hands, picking up the warm-and-fresh feces from the ground. Windy and sunny\
  \ were a perfect combination. After filled the sacks, we took our moments to enjoy\
  \ the waves and pale sands. \nThe second program was cleaning the beach. I know\
  \ it sounds weird, but we found a lot of garbage at beach cliffs. It was still in\
  \ the morning, we were driving to the last district which 20 km away from school.\
  \ We missed the sunrise, but it was still worth it. Sound of the waves from the\
  \ cliffs, the sunny light, and the fresh air got me emotional knowing that tomorrow\
  \ I would leave. \nThe turquoise beach, the trees, and the potholes were absorbed\
  \ right into my memory. \nOur last night in Boa was more about grateful of what\
  \ had happened than sadness from the farewell itself. We sang a joyful song along\
  \ with the crickets voice from the mango trees. We hugged and cried together. Even\
  \ though we did not know when we will come back, still we made promise to the children\
  \ that one day we will come again to see the progress we have started. \nWe left\
  \ Boa early in the morning, around 4 am. Like the day when we arrived, local people\
  \ came to say goodbye and wish us a safe flight. \nNot to forget, the were pigs\
  \ too, saying goodbye with their unique voices. \nOur plane flew away from that\
  \ small airport who witnessed our spirit to share and care."
