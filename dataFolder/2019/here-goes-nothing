Text: "A lot of people have given me (often unsolicited) advice about studying abroad.\
  \ Some of this has been vague, like \"Go into it with an open mind.\" Some has been\
  \ oddly specific: \"The one time I was in Amsterdam 30 years ago I had a knife drawn\
  \ on me, so be careful when you go into this one bar in this one neighborhood.\"\
  \ To those family members extremely concerned about travel danger: I figured if\
  \ I can work in Baltimore City and live in New Orleans, I'll be fairly safe in Amsterdam,\
  \ where the most common crime is bike theft.\n\nPreparing for my time abroad has\
  \ involved making a lot of lists that I never actually use, skimming some Dutch\
  \ travel guides, and google image searching \"pictures of Amsterdam in the fall\"\
  \ every time I get nervous. I packed all my clothes, unpacked, and re-packed my\
  \ suitcase three times.  I'm entirely unsure what my flat will need; according to\
  \ the housing website, it will come with a bed, a chair, a desk, and one pair of\
  \ sheets. As for everything else: \"Maybe someone will leave stuff behind for you\
  \ if you're lucky!\" -A literal quote from the housing company. Maybe I will end\
  \ up with a full set of silverware, but maybe I will end up needing to buy one mug\
  \ that I can use for coffee, water, and wine. \n\nWhile abroad, I'll be taking four\
  \ classes: two European history courses, and two media studies courses. I'll only\
  \ have class two days a week, which means five days to travel! I'm still not sure\
  \ how this semester counts as school and not just a really long vacation. As of\
  \ now, I have plans to travel to Ireland, Germany, Italy, and France. I recently\
  \ purchased my tickets to go to Oktoberfest in Munich, where I\u2019ll be meeting\
  \ up with Loyola New Orleans students abroad in other countries. Mom and Dad-- I\
  \ promise I'll still try to pass my classes at the very least."
