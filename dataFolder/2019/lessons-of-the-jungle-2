Text: "Sometimes even before sunrise, in the early hours, in the silence, something\
  \ within you resonates with it as if in recognition. \n\nI felt that first sense\
  \ of familiarity as I watched the steam from the thermos flask melt into the atmosphere\
  \ and entangle in the dewy morning, as our driver, Ammar leans over the seat and\
  \ hands me a cup of masala chai. For a minute, I relinquished my desires and surrendered\
  \ to the vast depth that I recognize as my own depth, and that precious stillness\
  \ that has no objective than to be anything more than to enjoy a cup of tea with\
  \ this man, and his jeep. As I grip the warm tea, we watch the world awake. The\
  \ sun rises over the horizon, spreading her gold in every direction, and seeping\
  \ into my frosted fingers as warmth passes through blood and bone. The branches\
  \ of each tree spread out in bounty as they bath in the rosy glow, and that\u2019\
  s when I looked deeper and finally saw the wild elephants in the distant fog. There\
  \ was no sound but the leaves were like the whisper of an audience in melody to\
  \ this moment. I remember thinking to myself that this has to be the greatest classroom\
  \ my University has offered me. \n\nI came to the jungle with a small group of my\
  \ fellow students from Australia, and admittedly a huge ego, inflated by the prospect\
  \ of witnessing at least one of the 3200 tigers that are left on this planet in\
  \ the wild. We had not left the heart of the jungle in 5 days. Every morning we\
  \ set out on the Jeep before dawn breaks the day, and we return when the sun has\
  \ melted into the horizon and our bones start to harden with the cold. However,\
  \ this was our last day in the jungle. Which is why Ammar had taken me out to the\
  \ skirt edges, where the land meets the water and the elephants play. As if it was\
  \ a silent forfeit to not seeing the tiger.\n\nThere is something terrifically inspiring\
  \ about the inner peace and contentment of this man. In a world full of chaos and\
  \ motion, he remains in peace with the land. He has studied the ripples of the lake,\
  \ the heights of the mountain and the call of birds in the trees. He has surrendered\
  \ his plea to the rhythms of nature.\n\nI remember having these polarising thoughts\
  \ and sitting there on the side of a dirt path, diverting my attention from one\
  \ of Ammar\u2019s rants to a butterfly as it fluttered its beautiful amber and yellow\
  \ wings in the rear of my vision, landing itself on my leg. Just then the sun broke\
  \ through the canopy, providing us with a brief cessation of her warm light to bask\
  \ in all her glory. Nature indicated a sudden episode of perfect stillness and peace\
  \ in which gave me great clarity and heightened sensitivity to beauty. I felt as\
  \ if I had finally mastered the lessons Ammar has been teaching me on this journey.\
  \ \n\nIt was in that very moment of realisation and release, the universe conspired\
  \ its magic and just as we relinquished our desires, I turned my head to the right\
  \ of the Jeep and saw her. Stretched back by only 80 metres or so, blending into\
  \ blades of yellow grass, it was the Bengal tiger. Sitting among all her armour\
  \ and softness. Our lungs inflated with life in every unbelievable breath as we\
  \ watched her prance her magnificence and slowly and directly across the path in\
  \ front of us, as if she was putting on a show. In that moment, my mind went still\
  \ and allowed myself to experience a greater dimension. There was no separation\
  \ between the tiger and myself. This fleeting moment, left a lasting legacy. \n\n\
  In those moments when time seems to stand still, we get a glimpse of what is possible.\
  \ A shift in consciousness that was so rewarding, I will treasure it for a lifetime.\_\
  Could it be that beyond the turbulence of the world and our own mind, there is a\
  \ silence? A realm of peace that is always waiting?"
