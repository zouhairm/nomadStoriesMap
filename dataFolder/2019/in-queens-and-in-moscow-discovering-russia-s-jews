Text: "Seagirt, Queens is a Jewish colony of the Russian Federation. Or so it seemed\
  \ the day I drifted through it. A five-hour layover at JFK would provide the wholly\
  \ unsought occasion to discover snatches of that country in my own. \nI was headed\
  \ to Russia, that cold March afternoon, and for the first time. 'I want to see the\
  \ water,' I remember thinking. 'Why not the end of the A Train?' I was in a globe-spinning\
  \ mood.\n\n\nSeagirt is not the neighborhood\u2019s actual name. The term is the\
  \ name of a boulevard. Technically, it\u2019s in Far Rockaway. But \u2018Seagirt\u2019\
  \ grew indelible in my memory, and easier to recall than the endless numbered Beach\
  \ Streets that segment the peninsula. \nSeagirt means surrounded by the ocean, a\
  \ description that also fits Russia, from where so many of the area\u2019s residents\
  \ had come. Thousands, especially Jews, had settled here as the USSR crumbled toward\
  \ a new century. Russia is surrounded by seas of its own: the Baltic, Barents, Bering,\
  \ Pacific. Each migrant traversed those waters\u2014a latter-day Red Sea passage\u2014\
  to make it here. \nThe A Train soared from solid ground, dancing along sun-flooded\
  \ sea, the track connecting islands. I didn\u2019t know you could do that in New\
  \ York\u2014ride a train at water-level, weightless, the windows lit to blinding.\
  \ We straddled spits of land and frames of mind, surging to the coast.\nEnding at\
  \ Mott Avenue, I passed crowded Caribbean storefronts, following the smell of brackish\
  \ water. A sign in Cyrillic read: \u201CApteka-Polyklinika: Our doctors speak Russian!\u201D\
  \ I crossed the boulevard and past a shul with Hebrew letters tracing its roofline.\
  \ The building looked to the water as if to the past. \nHeavy-coated women chatted\
  \ in Russian below Soviet-looking apartment blocks. Perhaps they had done the same\u2014\
  cold-weather greetings, encounters between bus stops and elevators\u2014in St. Petersburg\
  \ or Novosibirsk. I nearly said 'Strazvuyte,' to air my good manners and what Russian\
  \ I knew. Then I checked myself. Sociability in New York, as in Russia, does not\
  \ permit hailing strangers on the street. \nThe neighborhood flowed down the boardwalk.\
  \ Boys in yarmulkes huddled on a bench, sharing a cigarette. It did not seem kosher.\
  \ The wind ruled out swimming but a few hardy men carried fishing poles, daunted\
  \ neither by the weather nor what they might catch in Queens\u2019 polluted watershed.\
  \ Russian fishing was much the same, I\u2019d heard. \nSeeing Russian signs and\
  \ hearing Russian spoken effected a kind of sensory red herring. What appeared Russian\
  \ or Soviet was neither, at least not here. These Russophones had left by choice\
  \ and for good reason. Not least of these was the endemic persecution against Jews,\
  \ who arrived and sometimes thrived in this new Jerusalem outside Manhattan.  \n\
  \n\nIn Moscow, the Jewish Museum braced me like a revelation. More Jews died from\
  \ World War II violence in Soviet territory than anywhere else, it claimed. The\
  \ museum bore the testimonies of Jewish combatants: Soviets, communists, patriots\
  \ of the Motherland all. Simply surviving was victory. \nHad any gone to America?\
  \ Had they sworn \u201CNever again\u201D? Or was it \u201CNever say never again,\u201D\
  \ like Fievel Mousekewitz said, the Yiddish mouse from the 1980s cartoon? Fievel\
  \ was making his own way to America, to his dreams. In movies and in life, conflict\
  \ and ambition can drive refugees half a world away from home. Seagirt was abundant\
  \ proof of that. \n\n\nFlying back I met a Hasidic family, one of dozens on their\
  \ Moscow connection between Israel and New York. I\u2019d spent a week amid art\
  \ galleries, snow, and big-city loneliness. \nThe Hasidic man, and his wife and\
  \ their many children, needed to borrow my phone. Theirs could not withstand TSA\u2019\
  s network-scrambling within JFK. I pointed him to the spot outside where I\u2019\
  d gotten mine to work. \nHe came back a moment later, viscerally relieved. Connection\
  \ made. \n\u201CI thank you!\u201D he seemed to pray, grinning through his silver\
  \ beard. \u201CMay God bless you today.\u201D \nSmiles broke over his face like\
  \ waves under a sunrise. I thought of Seagirt, just a train ride away, welcoming\
  \ waves of humanity to its American shores. The Hasidic family, and their people,\
  \ had come a long way to get here. In a far smaller way, so had I."
