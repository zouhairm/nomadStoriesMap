Text: "On a cold February morning last year my dad dropped me off at the airport to\
  \ do the craziest thing that ever crossed my mind; solo backpacking to Singapore.\
  \ I know it was probably not so out of the box, but for an introverted hermit who\
  \ always prefers to stay at home rather than soaking up the sun and socializing,\
  \ it was very much monumental and even though that was not my first trip anywhere,\
  \ it was the very first time I did it on my own.\nSeeing the world has always been\
  \ a dream of mine, but for a long time it was just that; a dream. Even after college\
  \ graduation in which I always said \u2018now that you finish with school, you can\
  \ do whatever you want\u2019 to almost every soul who would listen, it did not exactly\
  \ work that way. Turns out, adulting is harder than it looks, even as I write this,\
  \ I am still struggling with it.\n\nDuring a bus ride from Terminal 4 to Terminal\
  \ 2, I feel that things started getting real, like, \u2018holy, I am really doing\
  \ this\u2019. Stepping outside and breathing in the foreign air almost felt like\
  \ a therapy, but it did not make me less terrified of what could go wrong and this\
  \ blooming hope inside my chest that wished I could share this moment with someone\
  \ else.\n\nAfter almost getting off at the wrong stop (thank you for your help kind\
  \ uncle) I finally reached my accommodation; a hostel in Kampong Glam area, another\
  \ first time for me because I have never stayed in a hostel before and in lieu of\
  \ trying something new, I decided to visit a hawker because apparently that was\
  \ where the good foods are. Sitting in the humid hawker, I couldn't help but think\
  \ of how different life must be for Singaporean working class; behind all the shine\
  \ and glitters there are people who live there and lead very simple life, it became\
  \ such a contrast to the feeling of walking down Orchard Road, where the only thing\
  \ I could bought was a $1,5 ice cream that I enjoyed on the step of a fancy mall\
  \ filled with things I definitely could not afford. Funny thing, I heard a lot of\
  \ people speaking in Javanese language and right then, I did not feel foreign, I\
  \ feel that I had some kind of kinship with these group of strangers in red t-shirts,\
  \ speaking Javanese language in the middle of Southeast Asia most luxurious shopping\
  \ center like it was just another day in Klewer market.\n\nI spent the majority\
  \ of my second day at National Gallery Singapore and I had a great honor of seeing\
  \ Raden Saleh masterpieces. Looking at the sketch of \u201CPenangkapan Pangeran\
  \ Diponegoro\u201D brought tears to my eyes; I could feel the sadness and desperation\
  \ pouring out of it, that reminding me of my own sorrow. Maybe that is one of the\
  \ purpose of traveling, making sure that you remember to count your blessings, being\
  \ alone in a foreign country really makes me appreciate my life at home more.\n\n\
  Just like life after graduation, this trip was not all that I expected; all smooth\
  \ sailing without blistering feet after walking from Merlion Park to Marina Bay\
  \ Sands, but despite all the hardships I encountered, I still would do it again,\
  \ because then I discover that while I enjoyed being alone, I also felt like sharing\
  \ the fascinating experiences with someone could make it more interesting and rounded\
  \ because you are looking at it with two different eyes. Maybe next time, I may\
  \ do it, taking another leap into the unknown."
