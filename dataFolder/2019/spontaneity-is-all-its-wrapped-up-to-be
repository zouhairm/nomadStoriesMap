Text: "I flew on a whim, to Portland, Or. It was Fourth of July weekend and an old\
  \ Army buddy named Valentine, had invited me to camp with him and some friends,\
  \ Mt. Hood, Oregon States highest mountain at 11,249ft.  I'd grown up in Alabama\
  \ and had never seen a montain range up close, like I had Smoky's. My first steps\
  \ outside Portland International Airport, and I instantly, was in awe! The mountains,\
  \ were majestic.  As were the trees. It as if Johnny Apple seed lived there himself,\
  \ I told him, as he laughed at my expression.  Valentine grew up in Gladstone, Or,\
  \ so he'd known of this beautiful secret, his whole life.  He said, welcome to the\
  \ Pacific NW, Chavez....and we laughed and hugged each other.  Bags in the car,\
  \ we began the drive SE towards Clackamas County, towards Mt. Hood. Mt. Hood is\
  \ a potentially active stratovolcano.  I'm certain, dinosaurs still live there.\
  \ The evergreens were breathtaking and intimidating. Once we arrived to the camp\
  \ area, we ditched the jeep and hiked it to the campsite with or ruck sacks.  It\
  \ was dark when we arrived at the already crackling fire.  Valentine introduced\
  \ me to everyone, all of which had been there for two days already. I definitely\
  \ felt like an outsider.  This whole new world that resembled Jurassic Park and\
  \ here I am saying \"ya'll\" and wearing clean jeans.  The differences we had, became\
  \ laughs, jabs and comrade, by the end of the evening.  As the glowing embers billowed\
  \ into the sky, Jeds guitar began to play.\n\n  I woke to the sound of birds, a\
  \ faint sound of a running stream.  I had no idea that when I unzipped that tent\
  \ flap, what I was about to experience. I pulled it open and was greeted by the\
  \ most stunning of Gods creations, I'd ever seen.  The air was crisp, a fine layer\
  \ of dew, and the sun lazily filtered through the monstrous pines. I grabbed a pullover\
  \ and my toothbrush, and headed towards the stream, careful not to wake anyone.\
  \  I couldn't wait to explore.  The ferns, the moss....textures and shades of greens\
  \ and yellows, I'd never seen before.  After washing up in the glacial stream, I\
  \ followed it up a bit, on a trail. There stood before me, Mt. Hood.  A lake between\
  \ us, I looked up with a feeling of belonging to Mother Nature.  A feeling you get\
  \ when you see how expansive the Earth is.  It's captivating...and so is Mt. Hood.\
  \  Then and there, I fell in love with the Pacific Northwest. That's about the time\
  \ I heard my name and was thrown an innertube.  As frigid as that snow capped volcano\
  \ looked, it was warm enough for a dip in the lake beneath. The Pacific Northwest\
  \ is a place of Majesty, without question.  A walk through the woods will leave\
  \ you in astonishment, everywhere you look.  I didn't expect to find anything, but\
  \ I found a world that catches my breath, over and over again."
