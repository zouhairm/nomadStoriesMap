Text: "I would like to focus in how interesting could be a nomad life, trip after\
  \ trip. The trip I'm going to talk about isn't just a trip, it's an experience of\
  \ almost three years and I'm going to talk about it shortly.\nI want to explain\
  \ why I love to travel and live a nomad life is my way to be, to introduce myself\
  \ a bit better to you. The reason why is the next one:\nI've been enjoying and being\
  \ part of an \"obligatory\" nomad life almost since I was born, because of a very\
  \ interesting story that changed my life completely, but this story is that interesting\
  \ that I should tell it to you personally. This story made me be the nomad I am\
  \ nowadays, will just say that I've been traveling, living and studying 8 years\
  \ around 10 different countries in the whole America because I was running away\
  \ from the Interpol police with my Dad. So this story brang me many examples of\
  \ how to make a local connection in every single experience i had there.\nWhat I'm\
  \ going to talk about is about an \"obligatory\" nomad life I've chosen by myself,\
  \ so it was obligatory because it was what I wanted for me.\nThe destination was\
  \ Exmouth (Devon), England, I faced it alone, because I thought it would be the\
  \ most efficient way to make a local connection as well as to connect with myself,\
  \ getting in touch with their society and costumes, and just being one more of them\
  \ feeling like I was it.\nBut as you should know perfectly each culture is a new\
  \ world to discover, and this is what cheers us up and encourage ourselves to keep\
  \ on going, the curiosity.\nThey're three years of life there, at the beginning\
  \ it was simply just be interested in them, show yourself interested in all what\
  \ they enjoy doing, their language, gastronomy, or even their way to be or act in\
  \ different circumstances. We have to be patient to connect properly with them,\
  \ but the best way is mix yourself with them.\nEven in our original country we can\
  \ find hostile environments, so I've learned that \nanyone could be part of any\
  \ culture, we just need to want to do it, attitude!\nI've done it working in different\
  \ hotels, as a barman to get in touch with them even better, and then when I improved\
  \ my social situation I started to play football and started in the gym, which gave\
  \ me more social life.\nI've worked at the \"Imperial hotel\" starting  as a kitchen\
  \ porter, once I improved my English I started at the bar.\nFootball was important\
  \ in this development, played for the team of the town ( Exmouth Town F.C.) and\
  \ we got promoted that year to the next level up.\nNext year I moved to another\
  \ local town (Budleigh Salterton F.C.) that year was even more successful for me,\
  \ I have many special mentions in the local newspaper, even with my name in the\
  \ news title, one of them was: \"Raffa at the double\" when I scored two goals in\
  \ a game, so it's hard to get more local connection than in this example.\nFootball\
  \ made me travel around the area, I've enjoyed every Sunday trip the gorgeous forests,\
  \ estuaries and animals. Those trips gave me the chance to enjoy properly place\
  \ by place. It was amazing to have contact with the local nature properly and enjoy\
  \ every single green landscape.\nThe fact of live this experience on my own, alone\
  \ was the most important thing, and to do it in a small town gave me the option\
  \ of discover properly all this English society.\nI could name this kind of tourism\
  \ as: Real tourism; means the fact of take one destination, one motivation, a certain\
  \ period of time, without many economic resources, living day by day with the pleasure\
  \ of feel the freedom of traveling and interact with different cultures, always\
  \ looking for a working and sports activity, and in consequence: a proper social\
  \ local connection. Wherever we do it, we do it facing the social reality of that\
  \ certain destination, and being completely yourself, with nobody else's help."
