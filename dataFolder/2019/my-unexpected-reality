Text: "A small American girl in a foreign country for the first time, all by herself.\
  \ For as long as I can remember I\u2019ve always been fascinated with other cultures,\
  \ languages and foreign traditions. Growing up with a non-religious white family\
  \ in a liberal area in America, I craved niche traditions, something I could say\
  \ that \u201Cyes, every year my family and I ___\u201D, or that I speak another\
  \ language, something to make me feel cultured and special. I had none of that so\
  \ I began to search. I found this craved-culture in the food I ate, the music I\
  \ listened to and the men I dated. \n  while living in America, I often opted for\
  \ food of different nations rather than a burger. I never say no to hearing music\
  \ from other countries whether that\u2019s their style of hip hop, traditional folk\
  \ music or whatever sound is most appealing. In men, it just so happens to be that\
  \ every man I\u2019ve had a connection with was not American. I try to stay as open\
  \ minded as possible. \n   The previous paragraphs have been a lead up to this one\
  \ now, my travel journey. My journey began when I was dating another foreign boy\
  \ who was half Italian and half Thai. For Christmas I bought us a trip to Italy\
  \ so he could explore his Italian heritage (and who doesn\u2019t like pasta right?).\
  \ Unfortunately our relationship didn\u2019t survive long enough to reach our departure\
  \ date, therefore I swallowed that lump in my throat and threw caution to the wind.\
  \ I packed my bags and arrived at the airport with me, myself and I. The three of\
  \ us were off to quite an adventure. \n  Before I left, everyone including my family\
  \ told me I\u2019d be \u201Ctaken\u201D or that a little girl such as myself won\u2019\
  t be able to handle traveling alone (mind you, I\u2019ve been on my own since I\
  \ was 18). All this negativity made me question the trip in its entirety but I went\
  \ anyway. \n\nWhen I arrived in Milano, the first thing I did was catch a taxi to\
  \ the hotel, put my bags down, went outside and started walking. I had no clue where\
  \ I was going, I had no exact destination in my head. All along the way I saw beautiful\
  \ buildings like nothing I\u2019ve seen before, I met people that were solo travelers\
  \ just like myself and I tried to communicate at restaurants in Italian (wasn\u2019\
  t the best but the locals appreciated the effort). On this journey, I felt a sense\
  \ of liberation I\u2019d never felt before. I didn\u2019t have to ask anyone what\
  \ they wanted to do or where they\u2019d like to go. I went where I wanted, when\
  \ I wanted. The best part of all of this is that I had absolutely no itinerary.\
  \ I quickly learned that the best things in life, you stumble upon unexpectedly.\
  \ This trip gave me that dose of culture that I\u2019ve been longing for my entire\
  \ life, it gave me a glimpse into how people in a metropolitan city on the other\
  \ side of the world live. I can say that my first time outside of the country and\
  \ being solo changed me and my perspective, it also gave me the \u201Ctravel bug\u201D\
  . \n  In conclusion, this trip to Milan freed me from the doubt people threw at\
  \ me about traveling alone, gave me the cultured experience I\u2019ve wanted so\
  \ bad and inspired me to continue. I\u2019m writing this story while on my second\
  \ solo trip (currently in Bratislava). I\u2019m winding down from backpacking in\
  \ Eastern Europe for the last two weeks, I\u2019ll arrive back in the states in\
  \ two days to begin planning my next adventure. Im forever grateful for the unexpected\
  \ way my first trip in 2018 turned out. Remember that some things are a blessing\
  \ in disguised."
