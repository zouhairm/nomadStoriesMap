Text: "A glimpse of the land in between \u2013 after hiking the length of the United\
  \ States along the west coast I decided I want to also experience everything in\
  \ between the west and the east: the pure distance, the landscapes, I wanted to\
  \ meet the people and see some cities that don\u2019t get as many visitors as the\
  \ big ones along the coasts get.\_I spent about 68 hours in Greyhound busses and\
  \ Amtrak trains to cover the countrys width. I stopped in Denver/Colorado, Kansas\
  \ City/Missouri, Chicago/Illinois and eventually will get to the State of Maryland\
  \ at the east coast.\_I met a lot of interesting people, good souls, lost souls\
  \ probably also, and heard many different opinions on and about everything under\
  \ the sun in countless conversations. But everybody was kind, open and very friendly\
  \ towards me.\n\nThe landscape changed from desert, dry, red-orange-ish in SoCal,\
  \ Arizona and New Mexico to more forest and eventually the Rocky Mountains in Colorado.\
  \ After leaving Denver I made my way across the Great Plains \u2013 hours and hours\
  \ of nothing but flat plains, farmland \u2026 sometimes powderd by an early October-snow\
  \ that gave the countryside an extremely stark beauty. \u2026 and an emptiness that\
  \ invites to contemplate.\n\nAfter leaving Chicago the scenery got more densely\
  \ populated, the rolling hills of the east started.\_\n\nAnd I got a glimpse of\
  \ a different country again, the country in between, the country ignored, almost\
  \ forgotten by the ones only seeing the east and the west coast. Travelling by busses\
  \ and trains in a country where cars are the\_#1\_transportation, followed by planes\
  \ to cover longer distances, is an extraordinary experience as you get to meet a\
  \ different country. You get to meet the rather poor, the homeless, the addicted,\
  \ the single moms travelling with a handful of children, the ones who can\u2019\
  t take up with a society of capitalism and pure consumption. You meet the ones who\
  \ weren\u2019t lucky to be born in a middle class family, who didn\u2019t get a\
  \ proper education, you got to meet minorities, veterans with PTSD, pot smokers,\
  \ line inhalers.\_And you gotta see the backyard of the USA: littered highways,\
  \ out of town greyhound stations, small towns were the daily stop of the greyhound\
  \ throws the local McDonald\u2019s store in a turmoil, little run-down farms on\
  \ the plains with a bunch of rusted cars behind the house that definitely won\u2019\
  t ever roll on a road again.\n\nThat journey added new shades to a picture of a\
  \ country that is as diverse as hardly any other I got to experience before. Its\
  \ landscapes are fascinating, the changes and dimensions spectacular. But seen from\
  \ a European perspective it also faces huge differences in the equality of people\
  \ and in the way the country take a care of its citizens."
