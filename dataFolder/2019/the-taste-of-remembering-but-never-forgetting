Text: "I never expected to find a more than impressive culinary scene in a town known\
  \ for Tsunami memorial sites and scuba diving.\n\nBanda Aceh has a dark history:\
  \ During the 2004 Boxing day Tsunami, the city on the Northern tip of Sumatra was\
  \ closest to the powerful earthquake\u2019s epicentre, causing mass destruction\
  \ and the death of an estimated two hundred thousand people.\n\nIt was here the\
  \ famous \u2018Boat on the Roof\u2019 picture \u2013 a photograph showing a thirty-metre\
  \ long fishing boat stuck on the rooftop of a house more than a mile away from the\
  \ shore \u2013 was taken. \n\nNot that this is noticeable too much these days. The\
  \ city is bustling with people crowding around food stalls - the smell of street\
  \ food and smoke fills the air. Moped horns and vendors\u2019 cries interrupted\
  \ by the regular call to prayer from one of the city\u2019s mosques.\n\nRecently\
  \ the nearby island of Pulau Weh \u2013 a tropical paradise \u2013 has become known\
  \ of as \u201Cthe best Indonesian dive spot you\u2019ve never heard of\u201D, the\
  \ surrounding crystal blue waters of Banda Aceh\u2019s beaches giving a taster for\
  \ what can be found beyond the shoreline.\n\nBut this is not why I am here. I am\
  \ here to meet my friend Max, a Banda Aceh local, I had met during a previous trip\
  \ to Medan.\n\nI recognise his smile straight away. Max, like most other Indonesians,\
  \ has a shining personality with a smile to match. He runs his own business, taking\
  \ tourists on city tours with his moped. Today we are going on a tour as well, but\
  \ a different one. \n\nMax has promised to take me around the cities best food stalls\
  \ and to show me some local cuisine. I joke with him in one of the only Indonesian\
  \ words I have mastered so far: \u201CMore Nasi-Goreng?\u201D He laughs and shakes\
  \ his head: \u201CNo, no..there is so much better in Banda Aceh.\u201D He hands\
  \ me a helmet and we start driving to our first pit stop - a coffee shop.\n\nAceh\
  \ is also often called \u2018The land of one thousand coffee shops\" and there surely\
  \ is plenty of selection. The coffee scene itself is fantastic. After living in\
  \ Australia for a year I have become a bit of a snob, but what tops it all is the\
  \ preparation. The coffee is filtered through a cloth lifted up high over the cup;\
  \ a tradition that has remained since the Aceh Sultanate era. I am impressed, and\
  \ after the first taste of coffee, I am in heaven. \n\nNext up, a small stall with\
  \ plastic stools and paper plates on a busy market street.\n\nThe first two dishes\
  \ Max showed me were Mie Aceh soup, spicy, curry-like soup and Ayam Tangkap; chicken\
  \ that is marinated with spices and coconut water, then fried with herbs. Both delicious\
  \ but surely spicy. Max laughs at my miserable attempts to hide quite how spicy\
  \ for my palette and many other onlookers join in. Travelling in low season, I am\
  \ the only tourist at this stall. \n\nSoon a little circle has formed around us\
  \ with locals sharing their opinions and stories with me: \u201CThe best food in\
  \ Sumatra\u201D one of them states, pointing vigorously at the stall. Another shares\
  \ his memory of the events of the Tsunami with me: \u201COver there, all gone before.\u201D\
  \ I turn around. It is hard to believe that the promenade and place I am currently\
  \ sitting was wiped out a bit over a decade ago. \n\nMax has gone quiet and is facing\
  \ another way. He told me previously that he had lost many members of his family\
  \ in the Tsunami including his three sisters. Nonetheless, he had still promised\
  \ me to take me to the well-known Tsunami sites later in the day.\n\nBack on top\
  \ of the bike, Max turns to me and says \u201CI miss my family.\u201D There was\
  \ something bittersweet about all the fun I was having previously, suddenly receiving\
  \ a harsh reminder of what disaster had swept the city and its effect on the locals.\
  \ Seconds later, however, his distinct and contagious smile has already returned:\
  \ \u201CReady for dessert?\u201D \n\nBoth laughing, we put on our helmets and make\
  \ our way before it gets dark."
