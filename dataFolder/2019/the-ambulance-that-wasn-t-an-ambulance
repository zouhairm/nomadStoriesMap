Text: "When I saw it ambling down the wooded path, I jumped to my feet and ran. Fast.\
  \ Probably yelled something unintelligible to my friend, whom I left with her Tiny\
  \ Tim crutches sitting on a stump in the campsite. This was our salvation, and there\
  \ was no time to waste. You see our first 24 hours in Slovenia were getting more\
  \ abysmal by the minute. We spent most of the train ride from Munich trapped in\
  \ a cabin with a lederhosen-laden, extremely inebriated man who belched sausages\
  \ and German sputterings in our general direction. So it was quite a relief to arrive\
  \ in Lake Bled and check into our cozy little hostel. Even better to meet a few\
  \ new friends to accompany us to the local pub for some drinks and stories! \n\n\
  And then things went downhill. Whilst running downhill. Happy and tipsy, I started\
  \ skip-running ahead down the darkened road. When I turned around, my friend was\
  \ gone. \"Missy!\" I yelled, and saw a head pop out of a ditch to the side of the\
  \ road. By the time I reached her, we were all laughing. \"Ha ha I fell isn't that\
  \ funny? Silly me, whoopsie daisy!\" Hilarious!\n\nUntil the next morning, when\
  \ Missy woke up with an ankle the size of a baseball. Had it been a few years later,\
  \ maybe we could've quickly resolved the issue by downloading a translator app,\
  \ Googling the nearest hospital, calling an Uber and heading on our way. But it\
  \ was 2003. No smart phones. No translators. No Googly. So I loaded up all our belongs\
  \ onto my person, and we went on our way, Missy hopping behind me. We finally made\
  \ it to what we thought was a hospital, but honestly could've been a vet's office.\
  \ Through a frantic game of charades, we managed to get \"X-ray\" across, and through\
  \ the return game (and several friends the staff had to call in for back-up), we\
  \ discovered that the only person who could work the X-ray machine was gone for\
  \ the weekend. But they did have an awkwardly small pair of crutches for us. Sold!\
  \ Next step? March/hop to the post office to mail Missy's luggage home. And then\
  \ it was on to the car rental agency where I gave myself a crash course in manual\
  \ transmission, which, thankfully, did not involve any actual crashes. Since our\
  \ lodging budget was now being occupied by our car, we headed directly to a campsite\
  \ to set up shop. \n\nAnd this was the scene. Missy on her stump. Me with my head\
  \ in my hands, trying to figure out what in God's name to do from here besides sleep\
  \ in our adorably small Little Tykes car for the next few nights. And then, the\
  \ ambulance. Like a beautiful vision from the freaking heavens, it cut that shining\
  \ path through the forest and made its way toward us. But I couldn't wait. I RAN.\
  \ Waving my arms and yelling. I imagine it looked a lot like watching a person lose\
  \ their actual mind. I made it without really noticing the ambulance was a bit beat-up,\
  \ and maybe that red cross was kinda faded? Undeterred, I rambled off the evening's\
  \ events to the kindly couple who, faces a mask of confusion, rolled down the window\
  \ to hear my tale of woe. \n\n\"So? Can you help us?\" I gasped, trying to catch\
  \ my breath. The woman glanced at her partner, then back at me before answering,\
  \ \"Oh luv, I'm so sorry but we're not medics. You see this is an old ambulance\
  \ that we renovated to use as a camper. Soooooo.....\" \n\n\"Oh,\" I choked. \"\
  That's....fine,\" tears pooling. But then the most unexpected thing of all happened.\
  \ This couple DID take care of us. Just not in the way I'd anticipated. They took\
  \ us under their wing. Gave us a tent, fed us, actually traveled with us from Slovenia\
  \ to Croatia. They were our friends and saviors for the rest of that week, and we've\
  \ never forgotten them. Their names, yes. But their company and kindness, no. In\
  \ the moment we needed aid, we got it. Big time. (Btw, Missy's fine! Just a massively\
  \ massive and inconvenient sprain.)"
