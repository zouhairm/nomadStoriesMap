Text: "April 22, 1500. This date has historically marked the discovery of my country,\
  \ Brazil, by my Portuguese brothers. On that day, we began a connection that will\
  \ never be undone, it is marked in our origin and in everything that I admire in\
  \ my return similarities with our colonizing country.\n Speaking of that, the colonization\
  \ of the Portuguese can be seen as a poetic event with the touch of Camoes and Alexandrian\
  \ verses with regard to all the good things that happened later and how much we\
  \ inherited from culture and wisdom. For this reason, I can not think of another\
  \ better country that could have found us.\n  With this in mind I imagine knowing\
  \ this country in all its details, visiting it is tourist points and also all the\
  \ other places that did not win a postcard. I see myself in direct contact ith my\
  \ origin, place that influenced our devotion to Catholicism and that it is responsible\
  \ for my country today to be considered secular, with a diversity of religions.\n\
  \  In the same way that I can witness it is architecture,in houses, in the streets,\
  \ in universities,in stores, not only it is secular architecture but also it is\
  \ modern architecture and being able to contemplate it is coincidences and differences.\n\
  \  Finally I will be able to know the origins of folklore, which is a Portuguese\
  \ culture adopted by my country. I remember all the times I went with my mother\
  \ to this event, I remember how wonderful it was and I was dazzled, for a child\
  \ it was incredible. The culture of folklore inspired our Brazilian myths and our\
  \ first carnival fantasies.\n  Besides, I could not be more grateful to inherit\
  \ from Portugal the love of the seventh art because the Portuguese brought this\
  \ culture to my country. The theater and the cinema, two important elements that\
  \ serve as a stage to express feeling, pleasures, moments, events and make people\
  \ fell all their emotions generating a self-knowledge after this experience.\n \
  \ Without a doubt could not forget the greatest element that is responsible for\
  \ forming and developing any country: people. I will be able to observe the people\
  \ still carry historical legacies in their way of being and how these heritages\
  \ are passed from generation to generation prevailing until the present day. Observing\
  \ people I can hearthe language that originated mine, althought today the Brazilians\
  \ have created their own dialects it is important to know that without a good language\
  \ to serve as a basis of speech we would not have created that vast vocabulary that\
  \ we can use today.\n  Therefore, I would be honored to take advantage of some memorable\
  \ days in this country that would provide me with a wealth of experiences as part\
  \ of my formation as a person and a traveler."
