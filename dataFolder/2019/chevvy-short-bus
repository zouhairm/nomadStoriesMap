Text: "My travel story and all my travel stories are centered around my profession,\
  \ which is music. Music gives me cause and excuse to travel. \n\nLast year we (the\
  \ band) and Maia, Kai (bass)'s sister bought a yellow chevvy short bus school bus\
  \ in Pittsburgh, for $2000. We'd spent all summer busking (street rockin') in our\
  \ hometown of York, UK for the dough. We decided we couldn't afford to or were too\
  \ scared to go. Then we saw some cheap flights, I called each member of the band\
  \ to convince them, it worked. We booked our flights the next day and with the help\
  \ of Maia, the bus a week later. Certainly a leap of faith! A, step into the UNKOWN!!!\n\
  \nThis story really starts in a bar in Berlin around 6 months previous where we\
  \ met some of our musical heroes by mistake and they implied they might be able\
  \ to help us to play in Texas at SXSW. We stayed up with them all night and they\
  \ ended up playing at a house party we organised two days later. This planted the\
  \ seed to go to America and probably changed our lives. \n\nThe plan was to drive\
  \ from New York, to Austin Texas and back in a loop, stopping to play shows and\
  \ playing (unofficially) at SXSW, the only thing we could (almost) count on at this\
  \ point. After months of colllld emailing, We did it!\n\nTravelling in this way,\
  \ as a band, immediately immerses you in the culture of the place you're in. You\
  \ meet many people and they immediately get to the business of showing you what\
  \ is great about where they live. \n\nIn Baton Rouge New Orleans where we were treated\
  \ to a WHOLE bin bag of crawfish, strewn across the backyard table, steamed, fresh\
  \ and messy. In Memphis where are new friends showed us the musical heritage of\
  \ the city with *free tours of Stax and Sun records - as musicians we had! to know\
  \ what Memphis was about. We often slept in our bus in Wall Mart car parks. This\
  \ is ALLOWED. Apparently the creator of wall mart was at some time in his life homeless.\
  \ He decided that the least he could do was offer a place where anyone could sleep\
  \ at his 24 hour gun shops! \n\nThe bus broke down. Obviously! In Austin, Texas,\
  \ three weeks in to our tour. A few highlights first, the fire in the bus at Walmart,\
  \ Nashville, camping in Arkansas, staying with Satanists in Hot Springs, free beer\
  \ in Memphis. We arrived in Texas, triumphant! Ten gigs under our belt and boundless\
  \ hospitality! \n\nIt died, we slept in a vets car park at the side of the road\
  \ and eventually crowd funded our way to a rented vehicle thanks to our friends.\
  \ No more sleeping in the vehicle now. On the way back we camped in the smoky mountains,\
  \ slept in a hut in a dubious hippy commune in Atlanta Georgia, one of our stranger\
  \ 'gigs' and asked people we met at shows if we could crash at their place.\n\n\
  In doing this we made some very good friends, many of whom have since come to the\
  \ UK and played gigs with us at home. Playing and performing music allows people\
  \ to see you. You make yourself vulnerable on a stage and show yourself plainly,\
  \ people feel much more comfortable welcoming you into their towns and homes after\
  \ that. \n\nBrushes with the Unknown include: \nWhen the bus broke down (for the\
  \ 5th and final time) we had no idea what to do. Hitchhike in groups with our gear?\
  \ We had to be in New Orleans for a show in like 2 days. Call Jerome? The seemingly\
  \ rich guy we met in Holland who'd given us his number, instructing us to call him\
  \ if we 'got into trouble'.\n\nWe did call Jerome, at the side of the road, after\
  \ we'd just decide to haul ass to Louisianna in our not very fixed bus, 2 grand\
  \ down the drain. I wish someone had filmed me calling Jerome and asking him bluntly\
  \ for money, such was our desperation. \n\nWe had a blast, it worked out alright,\
  \ it always will! \n\nRock on"
