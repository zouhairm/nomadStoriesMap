Text: "I am travelling exactly five kilometres today. It is seven-thirty on a Wednesday\
  \ morning. The sun is already drawing lines on the road. I am in Linden, one of\
  \ the suburbs in the city Johannesburg also called Egoli - the city of gold.   \n\
  \nI stop my car in front of the church. The security guard opens the gate, and closes\
  \ it immediately behind me.  Outside are about ten people who sits and wait on the\
  \ trimmed grass and the pavement, eagerly waiting for the soup kitchen to open at\
  \ eight. \n\nI\u2019m here to meet Anrinet (called Riri by her friends). Riri\u2019\
  s transportation is a pink bike called Bella. Her life\u2019s mission is to help\
  \ people \u2013 a sort of independent mother Theresa. She started a craft project\
  \ about a year ago. \n\nRiri\u2019s got an urgency about her. She talks at a fast\
  \ pace. You need to keep up. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t find the time to complete\
  \ a sentence. She gives a nervous giggle \u2013 as if she knows that there would\
  \ never be enough hours in a day to straighten every picture in this life that she\
  \ sees hanging uneven.   \n\nThere are over a hundred thousand homeless people in\
  \ Johannesburg. People come to the city hoping to find a better life, only to find\
  \ misery. Most of the soup kitchen visitors sleep in the park. If you\u2019re lucky\
  \ you stay in a shelter, a shack or share a room with six other strangers.   \n\n\
  The main concern \u2013for Riri are Decembers: \u201CMost of the soup kitchens are\
  \ closed for the holidays. The solution is to teach hand crafts and arts so people\
  \ can sustain themselves.\u201D She gives another nervous giggle \u2013 this time,\
  \ I think, of relieve. \n\n\u201CAt the end of last year we had an exhibition. \
  \ There were only five students who attended the classes every Thursday throughout\
  \ the year, but they were able to earn enough to buy food in December.\u201D \n\n\
  The student who got everyone\u2019s attention was Phumlani Thekiso.  I met him just\
  \ after breakfast, after the coffee and stew and a banana was handed out. \n\nPhumlani\
  \ is originally from East London, about a thousand miles from Johannesburg. He lived\
  \ with his aunt and niece before he decided to leave home. His mother died when\
  \ he was only eight years old \u2013 so his aunt raised him. \u201CI call her sometimes,\
  \ but we never had a good relationship \u2013 she could just never understand my\
  \ love for art, my need to draw, it is inside of me\u201D he says.   \n\nAlthough\
  \ Phumlani is an orphan he considers himself lucky: \u201CI was able to know my\
  \ mother. Not everyone gets that chance.\u201D I have only one blurred photo of\
  \ her, and it is still in East London. Then he looks down and says: \u201CBut I\u2019\
  ve got my mother\u2019s hands. She was also an artist. When I look down, I see her.\
  \ She is still part of my life when I create art.\u201D  \n\nPhumlani\u2019s sketches\
  \ with charcoal on brown cartons, was sold out at the exhibition. And he got his\
  \ first commission to paint a mural at one of the church member\u2019s home.  \n\
  \nAfter most of the people have left Phumlani and I sat on the grass and talked\
  \ for a while. He opened his handbag and proudly showed me one of his recent sketches.\
  \ It\u2019s a portrait. \u201CI tried to exhibit my  art on the street, but the\
  \ moment I turn my back, it gets stolen.\u201D He sighs, and then he smiles: \u201C\
  I  recently found a place at a shelter. My dream is to one day be able to afford\
  \ my own room.\u201D \n\nPhumlani recently got a full time job at a car wash. I\
  \ told him that I am glad for him, but \u201CWill you still have time for your art?\
  \ He smiled an said: \u201CEverything in life is art. I will do this job, as if\
  \ it\u2019s art.\u201D  \n \nI didn\u2019t expect to find a man who dared me to\
  \ look differently at my own hands. It contains history -   and the potential to\
  \ shape your destiny. Phumlani seems to never be lost. He simply looks down to remember\
  \ a soul that understood his destiny and constantly reminds him which path to take."
