Text: "The voice of the muezzin echoed from the minaret of the mosque few blocks from\
  \ my place. It was nearly six o\u2019clock in the evening and men started to gather\
  \ for their sholat. The same sound made me fell in a deep slumber. I woke up the\
  \ next morning with the smell of basil leaves mixed with hibiscus scents and agarbatti.\
  \ It was Geetha, a neighbor who was busy doing her Sunday ritual. She was wearing\
  \ a white silk fabric clothe which complements the jasmine flower on her hair. She\
  \ greeted me with her language and I responded with a nod and an awkward grin. Her\
  \ sweet smile faded through the scattered smoke of incense as I walk along the way.\
  \ \n\n   And then, I headed to a Chinese restaurant which is famous for their best-selling\
  \ \u2018Bakuteh\u2019. It is a dish with pork ribs stewed with a mixture of fragrant\
  \ herbs and spices such as garlics, cloves, cinnamon, star anise, fennel seeds and\
  \ coriander.  I would never forget how its freshness and umami landed on my tongue\
  \ for the first time. It brought some childhood memories that I spent with my Grandfather\
  \ before he passed away. I contemplated for a while. \n \n   My conscious being\
  \ commanded itself to bring out the camera inside my bag. It was my goal that day;\
  \ to take photos that reflect the beauty in everyday mundane of Batam, an industrial\
  \ place in the island of Riau Province in Indonesia. With my determination to fulfill\
  \ my goal I attempted to ask permission to take some photos of the monks who were\
  \ sitting outside the restaurant. I could sense tranquility on their faces as I\
  \ gazed at them. In my mind, I questioned, how can it be? Can you really find peace\
  \ in this world full of chaos and adversity? I had a second thought. I stepped back\
  \ and decided to finish my food and had a short walk. As I stroll the streets of\
  \ Bukit Beruntung I saw many Indo-Chinese who were visiting the Maha Vihara Duta\
  \ Maitreya Monastery. There's also this group of women on their colorful hijabs\
  \ who were selling rujak, (traditional fruit and vegetable salad), martabak (pan-fried\
  \ bread), sate (skewered and grilled meat), bakso bakar (grilled meatballs) and\
  \ other fruits on the streets. It was also a good sight, seeing the children of\
  \ different colors playing and running around with their most innocent smiles. \n\
  \n   Alas! I found myself looking at the glaring sun. For the next two years I will\
  \ be working as an Expat. The morning stroll somehow validates the fact that I can\
  \ find my own place in the city that is so unfamiliar. I know that there will be\
  \ challenges and uncertainties, but I decided to still move forward and take the\
  \ journey."
