Text: "Aren't we always curious about things opposite to our routine?\nBecause i sure\
  \ do.\nI was born and raised in sun island, Bali, the whatpeople called: island\
  \ of paradise. \nMany people dream about visiting my place, to feel the warmth air,\
  \ to witness the beauty of its nature, to touch the salty sand beach, but i always\
  \ dreaming something else.\nI crave for the white snow.\nMaybe because it feels\
  \ surreal.\nWatching it only from the tv screen makes me wondering, is the colour\
  \ really that white? \nArent they feel cold out there?\nAll to my conclusion : how\
  \ lucky people to experience all those 4 seasons, because i only have two seasons\
  \ my entire life! \nThen comes to mind, I wish to experience those white snow, once\
  \ in a lifetime. \nUnluckily, traveling for me is not an easy thing.\nTraveling\
  \ is luxurious, even a light one.\nI did not even dare to dream about it. \nNot\
  \ until i was entering collage and earned my own rupiah.\nPeople said i was lucky.\n\
  I call it a paycheck of a hardwork and sacrifice.\nHere comes at my 21, when traveling\
  \ became affordable. \nI travel once or twice a year to foreign country.\nSo far\
  \ i have traveled to several country in asia, europe and UK.\nAll of them give its\
  \ own meaning to my life.\nBut Turkey is the one that captivated my heart in many\
  \ ways. \nIt was my longest travel so far, 12 days best of my travel time.\nI did\
  \ not expect to love turkey this much.\nBut you know what old people said: it is\
  \ called falling in love because you have no time preparing for it. \nAnd yes, I'm\
  \ falling in love with turkey, almost for all inside it.\nIt was not love at the\
  \ first sight, though. \nFirst couple days at Istanbul was just like any other traveling\
  \ time for me.\nI was excited, of course. \nNew place, new sound of language, new\
  \ sightseeing, new smell of people, I'm freakin love it!\nI spent earlier days to\
  \ visit most iconic places there: strolling arround hagia sophia, taking lots of\
  \ pictures in Blue Mosque and shop (a lot of) the yummy turkish delight in hazer\
  \ baba. \nEverything was exciting as usual until at the third day the wheel of my\
  \ bus was going towards Bursa. \nAlong the way there I couldn't stop staring at\
  \ my window, my mouth was open several times, my eyes wide open, it was truly beautiful\
  \ path we've been through.\nCouldn't believe that it was real sceneries, it seemed\
  \ like a painting, a magnificent one!\nIt was spring at that time, around mid of\
  \ april, various colors of tulips blooms wildly all at once but still the green\
  \ colors from the grass dominating the road, truly a freshness for the eyes to see.\n\
  That's the first moment im falling for Turkey.\nThe falling is going deeper everyday\
  \ through the journey to the Green Tomb, Troy Statue in Canakalle, Saint John Basillica\
  \ in Izmir, Cotton castle in Pamukale, the famous Kapadokya and many others.\nThere\
  \ are too many wonderful places I visited along with its historical value in this\
  \ country.\nAll the places there not only entertaining my eyes but also fulfilling\
  \ my soul and broaden my knowledge.\nDidn't expect anything more, but the sweetest\
  \ surprise came at very last.\nTwo days before my journey in turkey ended, I remember\
  \ that was an evening at one hotel in Kapadokya.\nI sat near the window and suddenly\
  \ through the thin glass I saw something started falling.\nIt was white, like a\
  \ rain, but different.\nAnd i freaked out, grabbed my phone, excitedly open the\
  \ window and started to record my first snow experience in my life.\nIt was cold,\
  \ very cold, but my heart feels warm.\nThen I said to my own self: \"Don't you dare\
  \ to be afraid to expecting something good. Even it feels too far away or too wild\
  \ to happen. \nBecause your  todays vivid dream could be your reality tomorrow.\"\
  \ \n\nThank you Turkey, for the first snow to warm my heart."
