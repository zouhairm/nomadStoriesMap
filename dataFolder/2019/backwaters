Text: "It was a summer holiday.Being a Writer and a Filmmaker, I take travels to write\
  \ stories. So once I decided to take a travel without knowing where I am going to\
  \ head to until I reached the railway station at Chennai.\nLooking the map of India,\
  \ I closed my eyes and moved my hands over it and when I opened my eyes my forefinger\
  \ was placed in Kerala-Karnataka borders and I was excited.\nThen I bought a ticket\
  \ to Mangalore and had to wait for my train for 2 and a half hours and as soon as\
  \ I got over it, I decided to sit in a place where I find some vibes of my kind\
  \ of people which I choose instinctively and sat down in a coach named B2. \nThere\
  \ was an old couple and a business man on his trip, then after a while a girl in\
  \ her early twenties came to my coach and sat down opposite to me.\nShe was wearing\
  \ a Jean and an Yellow Salwaar Kameez. There were a few minutes of silence and then\
  \ once when I made an eye contact with the girl she smiled at me.\nAfter a while\
  \ we started conversing and she said she was travelling for a marriage.\n\nBefore\
  \ the 10 hour train journey ended we became good friends and then we had to depart\
  \ to our places as soon as we got down in our stations.\nMangalore being situated\
  \ near Kerala is greenish,filled with trees and the tradition of Indian culture\
  \ that is treasured over from the food to clothing though the western influences\
  \ existed.\nI rented a bike,a Royal Enfield and took off on a journey from there\
  \ to Udupi and Kollur which are situated in between a lot of mountains, where there\
  \ are rains drizzling all through the year and with the old Indian tradition filled\
  \ up to its fullest.\nI kept writing some notes for my story I was working on. Meanwhile\
  \ in a Mookambika temple in Kollur I met this girl again and she asked me to drop\
  \ her back home which was nearby.\nThe long drive,with a wind on my face,and this\
  \ beautiful human behind me was magical to put down in words.\nInstead of going\
  \ home,she travelled with me on my rented bike till the evening and told me a lot\
  \ of happenings she had in her life which I was able to sneak in to the woman protagonist\
  \ I was writing about in my story.\nI have always had a dream to stay in the old\
  \ traditional Indian homes and I decided to fulfill that,hence I asked her if I\
  \ can stay at her place for the day and she took me to her home and it was fantastic\
  \ to be there at her place for two days and getting to know her family of 12 people\
  \ with different stories,journeys and backdrops.\nI used all their names,attitudes\
  \ and journeys in my screenplay I was working on.\nI then took my journey on my\
  \ bike to Mangalore again as i had to return my rented bike and took a flight from\
  \ there to Cochin.\nI love to fly as writers open up minds in airports as they find\
  \ a rush with a calm state of mind between people and this vibes I wanted to have\
  \ before I ended this trip.\nI stayed in Cochin and Allapey in Kerala in a Boat\
  \ house for four days travellling all day in backwaters.\nLooking at these backwaters\
  \ took me back to all my sweet memories and times. Also,the journey through the\
  \ backwaters of Kerala in a Boat house opened up so much of enlightenment inside\
  \ me as a human being.\nBeing a foodie, I tried all the food that is meant to be\
  \ famous there like the Puttu,kadala curry and stuff.\nAlso,the payasam in the temples\
  \ of Kerala are so fantastic that it is difficult to decide how and when to stop\
  \ eating it.\nAfter writing what I wanted in the whole 10 day journey I took relished\
  \ myself and the human I am and as a writer as well.\nI then took back a flight\
  \ to Chennai to head back home with memories."
