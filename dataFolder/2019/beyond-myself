Text: "\u201CHow am I going to fit my mermaid tail into my suitcase?\u201D I thought.\
  \ I was heading to Mexico. The last few years had beat me down with lack of work,\
  \ chronic pain and severe depression. I decided I needed more whimsy in life, and\
  \ my answer to that was to purchase a tail and book a mermaid retreat. I needed\
  \ to hit the reset button. I had little experience with international travel, so\
  \ I did as much research as possible. To make it affordable, I needed to fly into\
  \ Los Cobos and take a shuttle 3.5 hours North to La Paz. \n\nIt was mid-October\
  \ and I awoke on my departure date to find the ground covered in snow. I was grateful\
  \ to escape. Fate had other ideas. Our flight was delayed. I attempted calls to\
  \ the shuttle service. I had no idea how to get to La Paz if I missed my shuttle.\
  \ My stress level was rising. Then suddenly, we were boarding. We got comfy in our\
  \ seats, I introduced myself to my seatmates and we sat there.\n\nAnd sat there.\
  \ \n\nAnd sat there. \n\nFor three hours\n\nDavid, seatmate to my left, learned\
  \ of my predicament through friendly conversation. After take off, he gave me his\
  \ business card and told me to reach out if I needed anything. Appreciative of the\
  \ gesture, I tucked it into my pocket. \n\nWe landed 7 hours late and the sun was\
  \ setting as we disembarked. I thanked my lucky sea-stars there was no line at customs.\
  \ I walked outside the automatic glass doors into the humid air looking for my shuttle.\
  \ I made a loop. No shuttle.\n\nMy heart sank. \n\nI made another loop. Maybe I\
  \ missed the kiosk? No. I saw plenty of shuttles and cabs, but I didn\u2019t see\
  \ mine.\n\nBack inside the airport, I approached an attendant. I learned there were\
  \ no shuttles to La Paz until the next day. I felt sick. I had planned for every\
  \ scenario, except this. I had no cell service or wifi, and only a basic knowledge\
  \ of Spanish. I could feel the knot in my throat rising. I had no idea what to do.\n\
  \n\u201CIs everything okay, Miranda?\u201D I twirled around to see David. \n\n\u201C\
  No, it\u2019s not,\u201D I uttered, and explained the situation. David started speaking\
  \ Spanish with the attendant, then turned to me and said \u201CSo here\u2019s the\
  \ deal. Come with me and I will help you. Or stay here and figure out what you think\
  \ is best.\u201D My brain was like, \u201CYeah, right. I\u2019ve seen enough TV\
  \ to know how this ends.\u201D My gut said, \u201CHe\u2019s ok. Go!\u201D \nSo I\
  \ did!\n\nDavid was convincing me he\u2019s not a serial killer as the cab drove\
  \ us to his condo. \u201CI\u2019m married and just became a grandfather!\u201D he\
  \ said proudly. \u201CI live part-time in San Jose del Cabo. You\u2019ll have your\
  \ own room and bathroom at my condo. Or you can stay across the way in an empty\
  \ unit I own. It\u2019s up to you,\u201D He added. \n\nThe cab dropped us off. I\
  \ got settled, found wifi and let my family know what was going on. I sent photos\
  \ of David\u2019s business card and shared my location. Then, David took me out\
  \ for Mezcal. We watched a soccer game and ate tacos. With our bellies full and\
  \ legs stretched we headed back to his condo, where I slept peacefully. \n\nThe\
  \ next morning, I packed, ate breakfast, and tucked \u201Cthank you\u201D cash under\
  \ a fruit bowl with a heartfelt note of gratitude. David chauffeured me to the shuttle\
  \ stop, gave me a hug and sent me on my way. The rest of the mermaid retreat went\
  \ swimmingly. \n\nDavid emailed me to make sure that I made it to my destination\
  \ without further incident. I sent him a picture of the view from my room and thanked\
  \ him once again. \n\nThis trip created a paradigm shift in me. But, it wasn\u2019\
  t only because I went swimming with sea lions and spent a magical week with mermaids.\
  \ I will forever be grateful for learning how I can make a difference in this life\
  \ by practicing radical kindness in unlikely situations."
