Text: "Inhale. Exhale. All the aromas waffling through the air. I was obsessed with\
  \ trying to distinguish the aromatic compounds that I almost forgot where I was.\
  \ Bangkok. A mixture of cultures and traditions. There was something special in\
  \ here. Probably the cozy atmosphere that the city offered. Or the mixture of historical\
  \ events that had been conserved for more than thousand years. It is still a mystery\
  \ for me what is hidden behind the magnetism of such an ancient culture. I felt\
  \ the desire to experience more and more adventures as I was observing all these\
  \ floating markets in front of me-human beings at their purest among a fascinating\
  \ variety of pleasures-herbs, spices, fruits. It might seem just like a system of\
  \ canals but it is something worth visiting. This giant market place reveals a stunning\
  \ scenery which is must-see destination. My Swedish friend Alma and I decided to\
  \ \"go with the flow\" and pay for 1 hour private boat ride when we were immediately\
  \ bombarded from merchants revealing the diversity of local food. \nI was just about\
  \ to try Tom Kha Kai (coconut soup) when another boat bumped into us- it was a man\
  \ and his wife. We talked about their culture, interests and lifestyle. As we were\
  \ talking we were floating down the canals, discovering more of Bangkok's places.\
  \ It turned out that the man is a local rice producer. He invited me and Alma to\
  \ his house where we were shown the process of producing, packaging, marketing of\
  \ rice. Later on we moved to his house where we were treated with more of the delicious\
  \ Tailand cuisine.\nLed into the world of unknown we continued our journey in this\
  \ dream destination. Activities such as riding elephants, learning more about the\
  \ Buddhism which has played a significant role in Thai culture, was a real pleasure\
  \ for us.\nWe let out world widen with the unique cultural and geographic features\
  \ of the Land of Smiles-Thailand!"
