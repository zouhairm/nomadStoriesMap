Text: "A zone I've always been curious but hesitant about, South India was a pleasant\
  \ surprise that punched me in the face.\n\nMy impromptu trip to Coorg and Kodaikanal\
  \ (also add Bangalore and Mysore) has by far turned out to be the most exhilarating\
  \ and wholesome trips I've ever had. The restorative power of unplanned travels\
  \ is a force to reckon with!  I spent a week in 4 different cities on a meagre budget\
  \ of 20k and that includes flights, boarding and lodging. \nThe kodagu district,\
  \ first on my journey, boasts of cultivating a surfeit of sandalwood, pepper, bananas,\
  \ cardamom pods and a dozen other spices. Oh did I mention coffee? The most sought\
  \ after \"Indian monsooned\" Arabica beans are grown here. The strong, bittersweet\
  \ fragrance of filter coffee is a staple aroma everywhere in Karnataka. I woke up\
  \ to the sweet whiff of spices everyday.\nThe only scary part was the communication\
  \ barrier, I think. The people however, are extremely friendly and quick to help.\
  \ \nI stayed in a humble homestay and was indoors mostly because of the heavy rains.\
  \ \n\nMy week in the Southern half was survived only on filter coffee and ghee roast\
  \ dosas as I'm not much of a fish eater. Although the one dish that did stand out\
  \ for me was rice and Pandi curry. This dish from Coorg relies heavily on authentic\
  \ regional flavors. Juicy, tender pieces of pork melt in the mouth whilst the spices\
  \ burst and make you crave more. The Coorgis use a secret ingredient called Kachampuli\
  \ which is a souring agent. It has a unique fruity, sour appeal to it. I think one\
  \ needs to try it to understand how very addictive the taste is. \n\nKodaikanal\
  \ had turned out to be much better, strictly speaking in terms of rainfall. Tamil\
  \ Nadu is another state where Hindi is not popular. Kodaikanal is a beautiful hill\
  \ station with a clear blue sky and hills covered in clouds and mist. Step farming\
  \ gives the place a different view. Hiking and shrooms are what attracted me here\
  \ and boy was I rendered speechless. 'Magic Mushrooms' grow by the plenty here and\
  \ I had gone shrooms hunting with a bunch of backpackers I met at the Trippr Hostel\
  \ (get it?\U0001F60B). They too, were on a weekend getaway. We didn't have much\
  \ in common since I was the only one who had come all the way from Rajasthan. Getting\
  \ to know different backgrounds was interesting. \n\nI hope to once again wake up\
  \ to the gushing sound of mighty Cauvery and relive these memories and also to explore\
  \ more of the Deccan region."
