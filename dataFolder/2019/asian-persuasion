Text: 'My leap into the unknown came in July of 2017...i had travelled alot locally
  in my native country of South Africa. Bungee Jumping in Johannesburg,Shark cage
  diving in Cape Town,driving through the sandy and hot streets of Limpopo and exploring
  Mozambique upon the MSC cruise,all of which was awesome but leaving my continent
  of Africa was a new experience.Travelling to Qatar which was our longest flight
  we had,and then Thailand was a different ball game.

  We thought we had everything figured out and planned as we vacationed in Thailand
  but it was a whole new world compared to Asia,firstly the language barrier was abit
  comical,everytime we wanted something we had to explain in gestures like kids as
  English was not their strong point. The structure of their buildings and transport
  system was so different to ours yet so efficient,the beauty of their temples and
  islands is just unexplainable. The locals also could not figure out my race,light
  skinned biracial girl with blonde braids in my hair..yes safe to say they didn''t
  know if i was white or black,European or South American,most people from around
  the globe don''t know much about South african accents so safe to day that my accent
  did not help my cause. I''m a very fussy eater and a creature of habit so while
  my friends enjoyed the local food which was mostly rice and other Asian food..i
  on the other hand had Macdonalds,french fries and Burgers in Asia,i am not a fan
  of rice so sadly American food it was,although i explored every thing else i possibly
  could in Asia,scuba dived,played with thr animals ( i am a big animal lover) ,went
  to most of the islands..1 Island actually had a big sign saying "incase of Tsunami,go
  inside cave" was abit exciting yet scary reading that. We made so much friends,we
  canoed into caves,went through rivers on bamboo which was the most peaceful experience
  of the whole trip. Our next stage was the concrete jungle of Bangkok,it was nothing
  like Phuket which was an Island vibe,Bangkok was just tall buildings and so much
  scooters,i have never seen so much scooters in my entire life,Thai people love their
  king,huge pictures and posters of him everywhere,he had died at the time but was
  not buried at the time. Everything was modern,people dressed differently,very metropolitan,i
  had two very different experiences in Thailand,two cities in one country that were
  worlds apart yet the friendliness of the Thai people will always be with me,respect
  is very big there and to shout is looked down upon. A lady was doing all our tours
  and she wouls go out of her way for us,i even got sick and had already paid for
  a tour and she somehow got the money back for me. Travel and Tourism is a big way
  of life for the locals,it is their bread and butter so they really do all they can
  to help you,we walked around anytime of the night,was always safe,you cannot say
  that for other countries,we thought we knew what to expect but we got a whole different
  yet lovely experience. People travel and research and think they have an idea of
  how a place could be,google and actually being there is very different,some people
  have bad experiences but luckily for us..our leap into the unknown was an experience
  that made us know that the world is very big and your native country is just a dot
  in a great planet,so take that leap and go to places,meet new people and explore
  because when you go back home you are somehow altered.Asia just gave me a taste..a
  taste for many continents and hopefully this time i will try local foods.'
