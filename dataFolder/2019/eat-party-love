Text: "I never planned to fall in love. But here I am, 10,000 miles in the air, watching\
  \ eat, pray, love and crying silent tears over a city and a stranger who both will\
  \ inevitably change the course of my life in the best kind of way. You see, in Barcelona\
  \ - from the second my feet touched the ground, I was infatuated with every scent,\
  \ sight sound, accent and language I found myself colliding with. The melting pot\
  \ of strangers, metaphorically dancing around a city that is so rich in history\
  \ and architecture and culture - that I almost forgot that I'm a single, twenty-four\
  \ year-old with nothing to lose, and everything to gain (When it comes to beautiful\
  \ men, sex and heartbreak anyway.) I indulged in my daily routine of waking up,\
  \ drinking coffee at my local and practising my VERY limited spanish, ordering Una\
  \ Cafe Latte con Soya, sin azucar por favour, gracias - you know the drill. I would\
  \ then walk down the streets in wonder, chin raised high, neck arched, peering at\
  \ the chaos of colour, drying clothes hanging from the windows of apartment blocks,\
  \ observing everything from the cracks in the decaying buildings to the veins on\
  \ a man's hand as he presses the pedestrian crossing button. The veins on a very\
  \ tanned mans hand. That hand attached to a foreign body, with a head of beautifully\
  \ curled jet black hair and a stare so intense that it could burn the clothing off\
  \ a nun... hold on. I'm getting lost in thought here. You get the point. I had to\
  \ ask something, SHIT. My bad Spanish leads me two ways, to the bathroom, and to\
  \ the airport. Okay okay, uh... \"Hablas espanol? Mi espanol no es muy bueno...\
  \ pero\" No. Parlez-vous fran\xE7ais? I do speak english though.\" He smirked. Now,\
  \ this is where my totally non-biased review of the city of Barcelona takes a turn\
  \ into a TOTALLY biased view made purely for the lovers, the seekers and the dreamers.\
  \ If you are after a basic, trip advisor report of the best restauraunts and bars\
  \ - click away now. If you are after an enchanting recount of the best ways to hide,\
  \ find and seek love and friendships... romanticise incredible cities, learn what\
  \ to focus on and block out the noise of this twenty first century shitstorm, you\
  \ are in the right place. My french man and I (In a spanish city, a million miles\
  \ away from my hometown of Melbourne, Australia.) spent the late afternoon watching\
  \ tourists take the same photo you will see on ten thousand postcards, listening\
  \ to the sounds of the bells and the car horns, filling up on as much free bread\
  \ and balsamic vinegar as our bodies could handle and walking down the side streets,\
  \ away from the hustle and bustle to find the most secluded, most authentic, most\
  \ indulgent wine bars Barcelona could offer (Note, not recommended as a solo woman\
  \ traveller, you know the drill.) Sharing life advice, sharing travel stories, sharing\
  \ near death experiences (Mine involving a shark, coming from Australia obviously.)\
  \ but to me, this - is why we travel. We don't travel to get lost in the tourist\
  \ traps and re-capture the internets most shared photos. We don't travel to run\
  \ away from our problems, but merely to find something in ourselves that may have\
  \ needed re-igniting, to learn things from complete strangers, to dance with strangers,\
  \ to tongue-kiss complete strangers (In the sexy way, not the Kath-and-Kel way)\
  \ and learn how to say more than 'Where is the toilet' in one of the most beautiful\
  \ languages the toungue has the ability to make it's way around. A few days in this\
  \ city, a few hours with this man, a few glasses of red wine down and I was unconditionally\
  \ and irrevocably in love with yet another city, the idea of another stranger and\
  \ - what is a rarity in this crazy world, in love with living in a fleeting moment\
  \ in time - not poisoned by technology and wifi and schedules and responsibilities.\
  \ Something which we should be reminded of every once in a while, to fall in love\
  \ with travel, strange places, and being young and free."
