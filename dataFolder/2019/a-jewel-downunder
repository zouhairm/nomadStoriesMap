Text: "New Zealand, a beautiful gem residing at the bottom of the world. It's a mixture\
  \ of hustle and bustle meets nature,  with busy cities and green pastures, the shear\
  \ beauty nature provides awakening your senses, from discovering hidden waterfalls,\
  \ to floating down rivers,  sliding down natural water slides in gisbourne, or journeying\
  \ up the snowy peaks of the cook straight or ski down My Ruapehu. There's no shortage\
  \ of captivating experiences to set your soul ablaze. From the peak of Cape Rienga\
  \ where the famous light house is perched, to the amazingly stunning Stewart island\
  \ deep in the south. There is nothing more wondrous than camping at one of the many\
  \ campsites waking at dawn to the beautiful sounds of the shore or the chirping\
  \ of birds, before taking a day hike in many of the natural reserves or taking on\
  \ the rapid of Huka falls in Taupo. \n\nNeed a relaxing break from all the hustle\
  \ and bustle?  Make your way to Rotors a one of a kind natural resort where you\
  \ can relax your tired muscles and refuel your body,  taking in the native culture\
  \ as you do. \nOr if your travelling with your family you can travel to hot water\
  \ beach in the Coramandel and make your own luxurious hot bath with naturally heated\
  \ spring water. \nOr travel to Auckland's parakai springs for a romantic getaway.\n\
  In the mood for a city getaway?  Well Auckland city is a city filled with endless\
  \ fufillment. An enriching journey through this city jungle will give you an experience\

  \ distance away from each other, or take part in many of the beautiful festivals\

  I love the beautiful country that is home. To me New Zealand feels like the place\
  \ that frees your soul and allows you to make your journey a memorable experience.\n\
  New Zealand teaches you that your tastebuds can be unravelled, that your eyes can\
  \ be opened, your ears can hear the natural music of nature and your body can feel\
  \ alive and revitalised.\nWhat ever your reason for wanting to explore the world,\
  \ New Zealand is definitely a country worth coming too. It is a place where you\
  \ can lose yourself in nature, awaken your spirits in the city and take your taste\
  \ buds on a beautiful journey. There is no shortage of beauty and diversity. If\
  \ your wishing for a taste of home, New Zealand vast multi cultural society where\
  \ your likely to find even a small piece of home away from home."
