Text: "When somebody aspires to become a chef, it's not just food that makes that\
  \ person so interested. It is the culture that backs it up which can only be seen\
  \ when they travel. \n\nI find myself in Madrid only to dive a little more. Just\
  \ a click away to check out the nearbuy towns and in very bold font, I read \"Toledo\"\
  \ \n\nUsually, one would search more about any place and go through some of the\
  \ images, blogs and websites but only this time I booked a train and left for Toledo\
  \ after waiting like one confused soul from India at the Madrid-Barajas Airport.\
  \ \n\nA WORLD HERITAGE SITE- UNESCO! \n\n\"Ofcourse, it has to be! Look at it\"\
  \ \n\nFirst of all, Never do any research if you want to enjoy your trip a little\
  \ more. I realised that if I had read or known about Toledo before I arrived there,\
  \ then I probably would not have enjoyed as much. It would simply remove the full\
  \ load of surprises that await. \n\nLocated on top of a hill which appears to look\
  \ like a castle town, surrounded by clean waters and clearly having an intense history.\
  \ \n\n \"This was not what I had thought it would be\" \n\nSlowly as I began to\
  \ walk around the streets and grasped more through my senses. It was truly a baby's\
  \ day out. \nKnown as city of three cultures- Jewish, Islamic & Christians. I learnt\
  \ this by noticing the infrastructure and how it differed within a small town. \n\
  A city known for making the best blades in the world are now sold at local souvenir\
  \ shops.\n\nBeing a traveler on a budget, I managed to find an amazing hostel. The\
  \ same day, I happen to meet very friendly Canadians who were on their great Spanish\
  \ adventure as well. A lot many cervezas in a single night, discussions about bitcoin\
  \ and soothing to the music of Floyd and Tame Impala. \nIt was just amazing that\
  \ one spontaneous decision truly worked out and I happened to make friends from\
  \ Canada who had the same taste as mine. We all spoke, laughed and shared our experiences\
  \ until we headed out to roam around town the next day. A couple of museums, tapas,\
  \ beer and enjoying the scenic beauty. It was their last day as they had to leave\
  \ for Granada the next morning, while I decided to stay for a day. \nThis time it\
  \ was lonely and before I could convince myself \"Solutide is Bliss\", for the first\
  \ time ever I meet a guy from Argentina. He did not speak English, I did not speak\
  \ Spanish but we did listen to my music and conversed using the translator app.\
  \ It was such a hilarious night and we both enjoyed each other's company. After\
  \ a few bottles, he even started speaking in English and I did not expect it to\
  \ be so good, but maybe I was drunk too. \n\nI could really be comfortable around\
  \ most people because they would think that I'm from Colombia. It's my skin color\
  \ and my sensitive accent whenever I blabber something in Spanish which would not\
  \ let people think that I'm from India. Very often, I would find people telling\
  \ me how much they love Indian food but find it too spicy. \n\nAnd now that I was\
  \ in Toledo, I could truly immerse myself as a global citizen in a castle town in\
  \ Spain. As a food enthusiast, I enjoyed a lot of spanish delicacies and free tapas\
  \ with beer and needless to say, I thought from all perspectives about what would\
  \ make a person come to this corner of Spain in Castile- La Mancha. \n\nWhether\
  \ you're an artist, a backpacker, history geek, a chef or anyone you will be amazed\
  \ to see what the city of Toledo has to offer everyone. Most bizarre and interesting\
  \ pieces of art anyone would find! \n\nThe best part about traveling to unknown\
  \ places, is the fear. Because when that fear is gone, there's calmness. When there's\
  \ calmness, there's room for joy. \n\nMy joy comes out of knowing things that I\
  \ never knew. It comes when I get answers before I have built up my questions. Oh\
  \ Toledo! You were amazing!"
