Text: "Staring at the decaying fa\xE7ade of the crumbling house to say it hadn\u2019\
  t aged well was an understatement. Teetering precariously, the colours were those\
  \ blended by a kindergarten child painting for the first time, brown, brown and\
  \ more brown. It seriously crossed my mind whether I would emerge alive entering\
  \ the pitch-dark porch especially as every single window in the house was either\
  \ broken, patched up with all sorts of objects, or simply not there at all. Checking\
  \ on Air B&B during the daylight is treacherous enough but in the middle of the\
  \ night was downright pushing our luck.  The taxi driver laughed when I had shown\
  \ him the address which was not a reassuring sign. But I guess that\u2019s what\
  \ you get when you choose a spot at random on the map. Before I could decide to\
  \ make a run for it, which with all my luggage was unlikely, a lady in a faded blue\
  \ smock leaned out the third storey window \u2018Hi, welcome to Quincy\u2019, she\
  \ said in a typical American accent. \nShe showed the three of us inside, and thankfully\
  \ our room looked exactly like the pictures taking my anxiety down a notch. Bryce\
  \ stretched trying to get a know out of his shoulder. \n\u2018I could totally use\
  \ a run right now\u2019, Keva said yawning. \nI nodded stifling a yawn of my own,\
  \ trying to squash a vicious cramp in my foot. \nThe three of us headed out in the\
  \ direction the taxi had driven us from the airport. \nA creaking sound caught Bryce\
  \ attention and he pointed ahead. Squinting in the darkness I spotted the faint\
  \ outline of a swing set. Must be a park. \nKeva jogged ahead of us. It was kind\
  \ of her thing she liked to run which is something totally sociopaths do. Who runs\
  \ for fun? The answer nobody sane. Running is for life and death situations in my\
  \ book. \nCatching up with Keva, we entered an opening. It was like a child\u2019\
  s play area met a luxury holiday resort but on a smaller budgetary scale.  Complete\
  \ with swing set, seesaw, slide and small flower pool, lit with miniature candles\
  \ creating a flickering glow throwing all kind of shapes around the park. \nI sat\
  \ on one side of a seesaw as Bryce jumped on to the other end almost jolting me\
  \ off. \nNow that I could see more of the park it was way smaller than I had expected\
  \ There was an alluring feel to it and despite how exhausted I felt I didn\u2019\
  t want to leave. \nKeva splashed her feet in a small pool which was covered in hundreds\
  \ of pink and orange flower petals. Bryce joined her splashing her with water. \n\
  I smiled watching her shriek in laughter, she has been so lovely this trip it was\
  \ nice to see her smile. \nBryce hopped out, with Keva howling threats all water\
  \ recited after him. \n\u2018So when you finally going to ask her out? \u2018I asked\n\
  \ \u2018What are you talking about, I mean how do you know\u2019. Bryce mumbled,\
  \ blushing slightly. \n\u2018Mate a blind man could tell\u2019 I said chuckling.\
  \ It was sweet really, they both were so cute however neither of them was prepared\
  \ to make the first move. I shivered despite how picturesque the place looked there\
  \ was still a sharp breeze present in the air."
