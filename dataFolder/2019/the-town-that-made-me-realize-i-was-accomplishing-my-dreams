Text: "I was supposed to go just for one day. Someone told me that one day was already\
  \ too much time for \u201Ctouristing\u201D this place. But life has surprises, and\
  \ I got many surprises at Toledo, Spain. This was my first time in Europe and also\
  \ the first time I travelled by myself. I landed at the airport in Madrid and I\
  \ had the chance to visit some nice places in a couple of days, like the Prado Museum\
  \ and the Alcala Door, the little market of San Miguel, etc. I had a wonderful time\
  \ walking in the streets of Madrid. Then I went to get a train ticket to have my\
  \ \u201Cmandatory\u201D visit (as a tourist who goes to Spain) to Toledo. I had\
  \ the opportunity to stay at a house that an organization that I belong to has at\
  \ this place, but I only planned to stay one night with them. \n\nThis was my first\
  \ time in a train, but I couldn\u2019t enjoy it so much because I was struggling\
  \ with jet lag and soreness that I had already before my trip. Then I arrived and\
  \ a man from the organization picked me at the train station. I will never forget\
  \ how amazed I got when he was driving me to the house. The fort that was surrounding\
  \ the historic part of the city was spectacular. I felt like I was back in XIV century,\
  \ suddenly I was in a story tale of dragons, castles and princesses. I couldn\u2019\
  t do a lot that tired day, but walking and seeing what I could do next day, I found\
  \ about some museums and some food that I wanted to try. \n\nNext day I started\
  \ my day early, I had found out how to get the bus from where I was staying (because\
  \ I was in a suburb) and I headed to the \u201Cantique\u201D city. I started to\
  \ walk in that rainy morning, looking for a museum, and in between many little alleys\
  \ that Toledo has (it feels like a maze!) I got lost and I found myself in a little\
  \ park that\u2019s next to the Tajo\u2019s River. It\u2019s almost like a cliff,\
  \ and when you look down you may see an old bridge, a highway and the river; in\
  \ front, you have a spectacular view of hills full with trees of these species that\
  \ I\u2019ve never seen and a castell. That particular day, the sunbeams were trying\
  \ to make for themselves a way in between the hills and the clouds. So, in that\
  \ rainy morning, with this amazing scene, I finally realized I was not home, that\
  \ I was really far from my Mexico, and that I was not anymore at America. It was\
  \ so magical. I had around 13 years desiring to visit Europe and I finally was there\u2026\
  \ and in that morning my heart finally got that one of its biggest dreams was becoming\
  \ true in that moment. \n\nAfter this, with more joy than ever, I spent my day walking\
  \ and visiting every place I could at this little but charming town. There are plenty\
  \ of little museums and interesting stores. From museums of clothing, to museums\
  \ of weapons and history of war! From chocolates and marzipan\u2019s stores, to\
  \ beautiful damascene gold and Majorca\u2019s pearls jewerly stores (plus, many\
  \ of them were affordable enough!). And let\u2019s not forget about the chance to\
  \ admire art at the museum of El Greco (a very famous painter that lived at Toledo\
  \ at the XVII century), visiting the Jew neighbourhood, eating violet\u2019s cake\
  \ (yes, these beautiful flowers transformed into a delicious purple cake!), drinking\
  \ delicious and diverse kind of wines, and enjoying a walk by a city where you can\
  \ look to your left or right and you see armours and swords decorating plenty of\
  \ the stores. I mean it: you feel like if you were back at the medieval times! \n\
  \nAt the end of my official first day as a tourist there, when I realized that I\
  \ still had things left to discover and do, also a night tour and a city sightseen\
  \ bus tour\u2026 I just had to stay three days more.  And I still would visit this\
  \ enchanted place again."
