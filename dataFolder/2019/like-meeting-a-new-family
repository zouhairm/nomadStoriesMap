Text: I was in Yogyakarta with the aim of finding a place for On the Job Training
  and also a vacation, after finishing with the affairs I stopped by at Klaten to
  my friend's sister's house. Immediately felt the attachment when I headed for a
  modest house, the first thing that made me smile soon and reminded me of  my childhood
  was smell of cow dung, it sounds disgusting but that's one of things that impressed
  me. We were greeted by their hospitality and warmth, whether the feelings I felt  were
  happy  mixed with joy even though this was our first meeting. They invited us to
  take a break to relieve fatigue during the trip, after being relieved I was welcome
  to take a shower which indirectly passed through the kitchen, I smiled again because
  I saw a traditional pawon or stove made of bricks then used coconut skin fibers
  and wood for fuel, even though most people have switched to gas stoves, but it's
  relieved that there is still some preserving pawon, because in my opinion the dishes
  made on the pawon are typical, there is a scent of smoke attached. After we finished
  cleaning ourselves, we were greeted with an arousing aroma, we finally had dinner,
  on the sidelines of dinner we were exchanging news and we were given advice to live
  life, after that we returned to each room to rest. The next day we were invited
  to go around while buying breakfast, when we arrived at side of the road with a
  small table that offered variety of food, the seller was very friendly, one of the
  foods was called jenang which is another term for porridge that I just found out,
  the price offered is very cheap, we were told why it was sold so cheaply because
  they sold it to help other and didn't expect to get abundant profits especially
  the ingredients they used were planted themselves, a value that I rarely see in
  cities. We enjoyed breakfast then getting ready to go to tourist attractions in
  Socokangsi, there are many tourist spots but what caught my attention is the waterfall
  and its flow which is like a miniature Green Canyon in America, everyone in this
  area uses Javanese language makes me have connection with them even though it was
  the first time we met, I rarely answered with Javanese, but at least by understanding
  what they said I became a translator for my friends who didn't understand Javanese,
  we talked a lot about things despite the language differences between us. I found
  many similarities maybe because we were Javanese, the hospitality they always guarded
  especially in rural areas made relations closer. Their simplicity makes us reflect
  on our behavior so far, what we should be proud of when all the material that we
  obtain in the end won't be taken away. Finally, the kinship that I feel in Klaten
  is the same as the atmosphere in my hometown Karang Anyar, they help each other
  even though in their agility, respect for parents always put forward even seen from
  the language they use is divided into several levels, for example the Kromo Inggil
  namely Javanese language is used to express the high position of our interlocutors,
  used when we talk to parents, there is also a language that is used by peers or
  people that younger than us, so I have not dared to answer in Javanese, because
  language Javanese that I learned is not Kromo Inggil, I'm afraid of being disrespectful
  so I always answer in Indonesian. This trip made me aware of my origin and the value
  of what I have to follow, along with globalization we arle often more interested
  in other people's culture than studying our own culture, not a bad thing studying
  other people's cultures because it can open our viewpoint to many things, but I
  think it would be nice if we knew our culture first so that we could filter out
  bad exposure from the culture we learned so that it didn't conflict with our own
  cultural roots, so I became motivated to learn Kromo Inggil in order to communicate
  more free and get deeper information from them.
