Text: "Landscapes can change considerably when you had little sleep and went partying\
  \ the night before.\nThe temperature was very high and the sun at its peak when\
  \ I stepped in the crowded main square called \u201CJard\xEDn San Miguel\u201D an\
  \ oasis full of laurel trees located right on the center of the city.\n\nI felt\
  \ like one more of those hundreds of tourists with sunglasses and hats,  chatting\
  \ animatedly, holding  ice creams in their hands, except that I felt  overwhelmed\
  \ with so many people, not chatty at all, and I wasn\u2019t holding an ice cream.\n\
  \  \nI was in San Miguel Allende for the weekend just to celebrate my brother\u2019\
  s birthday.\n\n As I walked around, I recovered from the initial shock. I was sure\
  \ for a moment that I was missing an  important information about a public holiday\
  \ or a celebration so I refocused my naturally curious mood to find out more. \n\
  \nThere were   many local families nicely dressed, it was Sunday and they probably\
  \ went to church. Like the tourist they were also having ice cream among other varieties\
  \ of street foods.\nIt was difficult to say in a quick glance who was local among\
  \ so many foreigners especially with such a large, well known expat community in\
  \ the popular awarded-winning tourist destination of San Miguel Allende in the Mexican\
  \ state of Guanajuato.\n\nFor sure, the long benches in the city\u2019s main square\
  \ looked beautifully sprinkled with a little bit of everything.\n\nIt did not take\
  \ me long to find a place on a bench between two women. My neighbor on the right\
  \ side was from Ciudad de M\xE9xico. She was taking a break from the heat and her\
  \ travel companions. The neighbor on my left side was a Canadian in her sixties\
  \ who resided in Patzcuaro Michoacan, \u201Ca nearby beautiful affordable town,\
  \ this city it\u2019s so expensive!,\u201D she complained to a Mexican woman about\
  \ the same age as  hers who was seated at her side, She returned to her home town\
  \ after many years living and working in Texas, \n\n\u201CWell, I live here in a\
  \ not very nice but affordable neighborhood. The rents in town are very expensive\
  \ now\u201D she explained to her new friend. \n\nOur seats had a privileged view\
  \ of the iconic neo-gothic pink building, the famous \u201CParroquia de San Miguel\
  \ Arc\xE1ngel\u201D, the spot where all the visitors take pictures. \n\nDespite\
  \ the crushing heat, vendors were active, and men in a circus act swung a tall tower\
  \ of hats on their heads. \nWomen offered beautifully hand crafted cloth dolls,\
  \ called \u201CMar\xEDas\u201D with round smiley faces and braided colorful ribbons\
  \ in their hair, a typical local souvenir of the region.\n\n Around the square lots\
  \ of vendors were aligned with their stalls of big paper flowers in fantastic colors\
  \ and all kinds of shapes that were truly a visual explosion. \nThe children played\
  \ to chase each other and broke colored eggshells filled with confetti on their\
  \ heads!. The floor of the square was covered in tiny dots of colors. The wind was\
  \ filled with screams and laughter.\n \n\u201CI am not going to take care of all\
  \ your bags\u201D, complained my neighbor on the bench from Ciudad de M\xE9xico.\n\
  \u201CBut you are sitting on the shade!\u201D cried her friend, \n\u201CYes, but\
  \ I don\u2019t want to take more responsibilities while I\u2019m resting\u201D,\
  \ \nThey got entangled in a discussion.\n\u201CStop it!  You are too loud!\u201D\
  , \u201CYou don\u2019t let this poor woman concentrate on her writing!\u201D She\
  \ shouted at her friend while she looked at me.\nI laughed loudly.  \n\u201COh no!,\
  \ I am not concentrating, I am just doodling, I am very well entertained, and I\u2019\
  m  having so much  fun.\u201D  I clarified.\n\nAt that time, a friend of my Canadian\
  \ neighbor on bench returned with popsicles for the four of us. It was not an ice\
  \ cream, but I couldn\u2019t ask for more."
