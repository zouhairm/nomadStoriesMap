Text: "Work was proving challenging in only one way and that was that I felt a bit\
  \ of distain from one of the individuals and I was having a hard time dealing with\
  \ personality clashes. In addition this American was making me reflect hard on issues\
  \ such as multiculturalism and racism. I felt really judged because I generally\
  \ prefer to please people so I was avoiding her in the interim. The classroom was\
  \ easy and flowing smoothly. Things were becoming more creative and my kids were\
  \ super sweet. At the time I decided that it should be appropriate, well actually\
  \ mandatory for schools to have a training on how girls should stop judging other\
  \ girls specifically American girls that have little abroad experience. At the present\
  \ moment I still agree with this sentiment but not to such a personal level. Distance\
  \ has proven beneficial. I also created lettering for our class name that the kids\
  \ painted blues and pinks watercolor style meets acrylic like.\n\nFinally a flight\
  \ later in later evening. So to Penang. I wrote to myself first thing in the morning,\
  \ \u201Clet\u2019s celebrate this shit & find love\u201D. I also questioned Penang\
  \ as I really love the street art and culture there: \u201Cwill be to Penang soon\
  \ \u2026 let\u2019s see if it surprises me.\u201D Things began too smoothly. I checked\
  \ in over the counter and I had a 4a window seat which was top priority which never\
  \ happens. There was also no one in the middle seat which was a strange sense of\
  \ eerie. And in the split second that I wrote down this thought one of the stewardesses\
  \ came up to me and said you are on the wrong flight this flight is going to KL.\
  \ My heart dropped as I seriously have the worst airport anxiety because of several\
  \ several instances like this. Air Asia had changed my gate number I had checked\
  \ with them twice and they let me get on the wrong plane even when I confirmed to\
  \ Penang. At that moment I was in an immigration hell battle with the airline which\
  \ I had little hopes of winning and was \u201Cso so sad\u201D. The only thing I\
  \ could say to comfort myself was that I hate airports. I screamed and cried and\
  \ at first they wanted me to pay, then fly the next day, and eventually they agreed\
  \ to put me on the next flight. It sucked was awful and I felt a bit like a horrible\
  \ celebrity at the airport and desired to leave as soon as was humanly possible.\
  \ Eventually everything was sorted and I arrived in Penang at midnight. A one hour\
  \ flight had turned into ten hours, but I was to Penang I just had to get to the\
  \ hostel.\n\nI found the hostel with a blond girl speaking in French out front on\
  \ the phone who paused and informed me the guest house had just shut its doors for\
  \ the day (at midnight) and only the guests had key cards which had to be obtained\
  \ when one checked in. Obviously. My luck for the day was outstanding. But compared\
  \ to earlier I was really just looking at life as more of a hurdle race instead\
  \ of an end of the world race. So I was directed to a street with many bars, a girl\
  \ helped me, there were quite a few that were closed or full, but eventually I was\
  \ kindly ushered in by a hippy looking Malaysian gentleman at the Love Lane Hotel\
  \ listening to poor techno music with a room full of Germans who gave me a beer\
  \ and guided me to a spare room. That was my happy world at that moment and while\
  \ I still had no mosquito spray and was being eaten alive, I was quite happy to\
  \ be alive and in Penang. I slept so soundly and realized how much I hated the sound\
  \ of air con drifting off to sleep with an open window with pink bunny sheets for\
  \ curtains, lilac colored walls with prints of soft light neon green leaves, a thin\
  \ plain sheet, and a fan."
