Text: "I never would have guessed that on my first trip ever to South America, my\
  \ ability to speak Italian would be so useful. Travelling alone is an amazing life\
  \ experience that I have pursued ever since my first solo adventure many years ago.\
  \ Although South America was a brand new continent that I have never been to, I\
  \ felt confident in my abilities as a traveller, and I was excited beyond words\
  \ to explore this exotic land. \n\nI landed late at night in Quito the capital of\
  \ Ecuador, and spent the night in a cozy bed and breakfast not far from the airport.\
  \ The next morning I was on the move. Using my Italian language skills I was able\
  \ to communicate very tryingly with the Spanish speaking locals but it was enough\
  \ to get myself to a bus stop that was serviced by inter-regional buses. At this\
  \ point I had realized that my Ecuadorian SIM card wasn't working properly, so I\
  \ had no google maps to assist me. I was worried for only a split second before\
  \ I became excited by the concept of travelling without the help of technology the\
  \ way my great uncle travelled the world when he was my age. \n\nAfter changing\
  \ buses a couple of times, I ended up in the town of Puyo. Oddly we were dropped\
  \ off on a street corner nowhere near the bus station. I began asking around for\
  \ the bus station, and became increasingly concerned as multiple people pointed\
  \ in the direction of the bus station but then quickly warned me not to walk there\
  \ because it was too dangerous. I decided to take there advice seriously, and my\
  \ adventure without technology ended abruptly. \n\nI found an internet cafe and\
  \ looked up the bus schedule. There were no buses to Macas until the next morning.\
  \ I found a room for rent, and took a taxi there to avoid the dangers of being alone\
  \ on foot. When we got closer to the accommodations I quickly realized the dangers\
  \ the locals had warned me about. There were shady figures lurking everywhere, abandoned\
  \ buildings, and burnt out street lights making some street corners pitch black.\
  \ The address didn't make sense to the taxi driver so he called with his cell phone\
  \ since mine was not working. The host apparently told the driver my booking didn't\
  \ exist. I decided to ask AirBnB for a refund, and I asked the driver to bring me\
  \ out of this apocalyptic corner of town. Close to the bus station, I found a quaint\
  \ hotel that only cost $12 USD for the night. \n\nOh the glory of wi-fi ! \n\nUsing\
  \ the wi-fi of the hotel I was able to contact my host in Macas and give him an\
  \ ETA. The next morning riding the bus into the amazon was breathtaking. The raging\
  \ rivers and waterfalls, surrounded by deep green lush jungle and mountains blanketed\
  \ with mist. It was a beautiful journey I'll never forget. In the heart of the amazon,\
  \ and all of this natural beauty was the town of Macas. I got off the bus and found\
  \ myself slowly twirling in circles to soak up the beautiful chaos of the jungle\
  \ town. With the colourful storefronts, and the bustling locals it was like a tiny\
  \ metropolis. A tiny metropolis encircled by dark green jungle as far as the eye\
  \ can see. \n\nMy host easily found me, as I stuck out like a sore thumb... a wide\
  \ eyed sore thumb twirling in awe. I spent a week just outside Macas with some wonderful\
  \ people before heading back to Quito. On the way stopping in the extreme adventure\
  \ paradise of Ba\xF1os de Agua Santa, and the amazing mountain village of Quilotoa\
  \ located at the edge of a massive volcanic caldera that is now filled with vibrant\
  \ green waters. Like something out of Lord of the Rings, the trek down into the\
  \ crater to the beautiful lagoon was magical and dreamlike.  \n\nThe magic and beauty\
  \ of the landscape and the people was overwhelming. This was my first trip to South\
  \ America, but it will most definitely not be my last!"
