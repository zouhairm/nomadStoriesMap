Text: "I want to participate in this contest, not only for the love I have in traveling,\
  \ but 2 years ago a Balasar historian in Portugal came to my family looking for\
  \ important information to complete his book.\nMy family is from Portugal and the\
  \ historian Jose Ferreira came to my family through his studies and connected us\
  \ with history of Manoel da Costa\nresponsible for starting my family in Brazil.\
  \ We were able to find the house in Balasar that belonged to the family, and my\
  \ cousin married today with a Portuguese, had the opportunity to go to know the\
  \ exact place.\nThe name of the book is Balasar in the century of D. Benta. \nI\
  \ will be very happy to write history in the home country of my family. I connect\
  \ with this culture that I love so much, and I can write on my family's blog, because\
  \ after the historian Jose Ferreira came to our family to collect more information,we\
  \ update a blog of our family, writing and publishing more about the past of our\
  \ family with photos, documents, letters, and certainly I will contribute when I\
  \ am in Portugal writing about trave. I also hope to learn more about the other\
  \ regions of Portugal. I want to know, learn and write about customs, food, parties,\
  \ traditions. all this draws my attention.\nmy family is 100% linked to Portugal\
  \ by history and nothing will make me prouder than learning to write history where\
  \ everything started and have the opportunity to meet the local and the historian\
  \ Jose Ferreira.\nThank you very much for the opportunity."
