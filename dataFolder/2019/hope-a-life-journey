Text: "I am an Indian expat, born and raised in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I spent\
  \ more than twenty years living in the Middle Eastern countries. I have recently\
  \ graduated with my Dual Masters in Business and Psychology in the United Kingdom.\
  \ I spent more than twenty years living in the Middle Eastern countries.\n\nMy previous\
  \ experience as an international student living in the UK made me more aware of\
  \ my hidden passion and interests in outdoor activities. Such as hiking, mountain\
  \ climbing, archery, horse riding, nature lover and travel photography and much\
  \ more. I have developed my keen interests not only explored different part of the\
  \ world for leisure. To my knowledge and interests, I travel overseas to connect\
  \ with the locals, to know more about their culture, education, cuisine and market\
  \ prospects. \n\nSince 2016, I seized my opportunity to explore different regions\
  \ in the United Kingdom where I have shared my travel experience on social media\
  \ platforms. To some, travelling abroad would probably be for leisure purpose. For\
  \ me, it is not only just a therapeutic approach, but I have also developed cross-cultural\
  \ understanding and self-discovery where my level of resilience, extraversion, open-mindedness\
  \ have significantly increased.  I felt more contented and meaningful which enriched\
  \ both my learning, documented and shared my travel experience as a story-teller\
  \ upon arrival in my country and meeting up different people around the world. \n\
  \nAt the moment, I am exploring a number of options to make my own living. I am\
  \ eagerly looking forward to traveling to different countries to discover the wonders\
  \ of the world. Moreover, sharing my unforgettable journeys through my Blog and\
  \ Social Media platforms. From my point of perspective, I believe that there is\
  \ an element of psychology has a deep connection around us when one is travelling.\
  \ For the past three years, I have predominantly shared my journeys both as a traveller\
  \ and a resident in the UK and Middle Eastern countries on Facebook and Instagram.\
  \ And I found myself surrounded with tons of inspirations from the locals, fellow\
  \ travellers and country's history as well as success. \n\nI am very pleased to\
  \ find World Nomads for offering an amazing scholarship for individuals who are\
  \ interested in travel writing, photography and story-telling. My interests heavily\
  \ lies in travel photography, story-telling, history and wildlife nature."
