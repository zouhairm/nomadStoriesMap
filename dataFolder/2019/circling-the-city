Text: "I sat in the crowded train surrounded by chaos - chickens roaming the aisle\
  \ tutting amongst themselves, huge bags of fresh smelling crops stacked precariously\
  \ on top of each other, chattering middle aged women gossiping about the latest\
  \ scandals with the juxtaposition of the calm scenery rushing past me.\n\nRiding\
  \ the Yangon Circle Line Train was recommended to me as a way to immerse myself\
  \ in the culture and regular going ons of the capital city; a three hour snapshot\
  \ of the lives of dozens of locals. I was the only foreigner in the train surrounded\
  \ by countless other community members. Women returning from markets with their\
  \ towering armfuls of goods. Monks serenely gazing out of the train deep in thought.\
  \ Food and drink vendors clambering up the aisles, baskets wobbling upon their heads,\
  \ to help you quench your thirst or hunger with homemade treats.\n\nAs I sat looking\
  \ out at the countryside through the open doors, I was gently nudged by an elderly\
  \ man sitting next to me. He began to speak, introducing himself and explaining\
  \ to me that he always rides this line in hope of meeting foreigners so that he\
  \ can become more aware of those with lives far different to his. He pulled a battered\
  \ old journal from his satchel and opened it, showing me pages and pages of quotes\
  \ from various languages, notes from past train friends, and little drawings I imagined\
  \ he sketched when he didn\u2019t manage to make anyone\u2019s acquaintance that\
  \ day. He animatedly explained to me that he recently learned what FOMO and YOLO\
  \ means, beaming proudly at his extensive knowledge of the English language.\n\n\
  We sat together chatting and enjoying each other\u2019s company, until the train\
  \ chugged to a stop. He wasn\u2019t yet ready for our adventure to end, and invited\
  \ me for lunch at a dilapidated but homely looking restaurant he said he often frequented.\
  \ When ordering our meals, he ensured that there was a variety of local food for\
  \ me to try, and took care to ensure that my vegetarian needs were met. After finishing\
  \ the delicious Burmese dishes, including fragrant potato curry, mashed beans and\
  \ a tangy bamboo and chickpea stew, he led me to a local tea house to relax, drink\
  \ tea and have some sweets. We solidified our friendship by taking a selfie together,\
  \ our arms curved above our heads to form a love heart; his suggested pose. Before\
  \ long he had assigned himself as my official tour guide, showing me around the\
  \ bustling streets, pointing out beautiful buildings and temples, and teaching me\
  \ about the city\u2019s history.\n\nThe afternoon was growing late, and I decided\
  \ it was time for me to head back to my hostel. I excused myself apologetically,\
  \ offering whatever money I could rustle up from the bottom of my backpack as thanks.\
  \ Refusing to take anything, he instead thanked me, explaining that speaking with\
  \ me and learning about my ways of life was all he could ask for in return. He then\
  \ promptly left, with a final cheerful wave. I watched him go as the sun faded behind\
  \ the glistening gold temple nearby, the peaceful environment a strong contrast\
  \ to the start of my day. I headed down the emptying streets, admittedly surprised\
  \ but extremely touched by his selflessness, his actions giving me a refreshing\
  \ insight into humanity at its best."
