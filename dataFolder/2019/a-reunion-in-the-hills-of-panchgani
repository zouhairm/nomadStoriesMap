Text: "I had decided to take a bus to this small little town, Panchgani just outside\
  \ Mumbai on a cold winter morning in 2017. I had heard of its colonial history and\
  \ wished to witness the calmness of the hills and at the same time explore the ancestral\
  \ buildings of the town. On my first day, I decided to stroll through the old lanes\
  \ of Sawant Market, which was located near the main junction known as Chatrapati\
  \ Shivaji Maharaj Chowk. \n\nThere were thrift shops, bakery shops and some delicious\
  \ strawberries around me. The air smelled like a warm winter morning, with a breeze\
  \ that carried the small of its trees with a sweetness of the red coloured berries.\
  \ I came upon a trinket shop and as I was coming out of the shop, I saw an old man\
  \ on the street with a small cloth bag, one that people use for groceries, who was\
  \ surrounded by young people curiously looking into his cloth bag. As soon as I\
  \ step up to the old man to fulfill my curiosity, I find that there are two beautiful\
  \ white and brown coloured puppies inside his cloth bag. They were asleep but I\
  \ could feel that something was wrong. I could smell liquor on this old man and\
  \ the puppies seemed too young to have been licensed for sale. It wasn\u2019t much\
  \ later that two women, one with a slim and lean body and the other with a healthy,\
  \ wrestler like body walked towards us. They inquired what was going on and after\
  \ a while it was just these two women and me, negotiating and asking the old man\
  \ for answers. Soon seeing himself cornered, he left the puppies in my arm and fled.\
  \ Upon checking on the puppies, we found them breathing unevenly and they seemed\
  \ hungry. The slim woman introduced herself as Pooja, who runs a farm in Pune and\
  \ is very familiar with animals, especially dogs which seemed like a lucky coincidence\
  \ to me. She said we should take these puppies home and take care of them overnight.\
  \ The healthy, wrestler like woman, turned out to be a rugby player and both these\
  \ women were lovers. All of a sudden, I was part of their story and they were a\
  \ part of mine. We fed the puppies overnight and decided to search for the man in\
  \ the same market the very next morning. \n\nThe next morning, however we weren\u2019\
  t that lucky. Due to political unrest in nearby city, Mumbai, we were in the middle\
  \ of a curfew. There were less people on the street and we couldn\u2019t find many\
  \ to help us identify the old man whose photo we had taken the previous day. Soon\
  \ a rag picker told us that she could help as she recognized the old man as someone\
  \ who frequented these markets. In the middle of all this, something strange was\
  \ happening too. Pooja, the slim woman, was attempting to communicate spiritually\
  \ to these new born pups. She said that she has been trained in reading a dog's\
  \ mind and can see a blurry vision of their white furry mother. I was a skeptic\
  \ and so I could not put my trust to this revelation. Pooja also revealed that she\
  \ can see the mother dog in a red building, surrounded by big stone walls nearby\
  \ a church. The rag picker soon pointed us out towards a direction where she thought\
  \ the old man could be found. We followed the directions, and I could not believe\
  \ where we were standing. We were right in front of a red building, with big stone\
  \ walls and right opposite it, was a church. \n\nOnce we entered the red building,\
  \ we found a woman with a child sitting on one corner and a white furry dog nursing\
  \ her other puppies at the other. It was a beautiful reunion for the puppies and\
  \ an out of the world experience that I never expected to find. The old man turned\
  \ out to be a janitor in the building, who wanted to sell the puppies for some few\
  \ extra bucks to help him buy a drink or two. \n\nIt was a beautiful day. A hopeful\
  \ one."
