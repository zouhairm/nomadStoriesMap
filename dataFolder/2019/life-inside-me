Text: "Trust me, at some point in your life you`ll have a break down. It`ll come by\
  \ love, by pain, by loss. No matter how perfect your life seems to be, how amansingli\
  \ well done it is, you`ll have a break down. And, at this point, if you`re not prepared\
  \ you`ll fall and maybe never lift up again. \nI discovered it at 38 years, of a\
  \ fairy tale life. I had the most amazing parents. Two lovely and supportive brothers.\
  \ A few great friends that lasts for over 20 years and the love of my life.  And\
  \ yes, my break down came because of love, or maybe it would be better to say because\
  \ of love pain. \nI used to have it all planned. My own blue eyed prince charming\
  \ on a steal horse. The perfect life in a cozy apartment in Italy, having ice cream,\
  \ nice food, some adventure,  and living an ordinary and happy and loving life.\n\
  One day, this fairy started to fall apart. My prince charming, although remained\
  \ a prince, with the most beautiful blue eyes, was not so charming and gentle anymore.\
  \ Problem is, I had left behind my entire life, family and friends to be by his\
  \ side. I made him my rock, my safe, my only dream but, suddenly, I had nothing\
  \ and no one, not even me. Probably, no not probably, surely, I was not the princess\
  \ I used to be anymore. \nAt this moment I started my life all over again, and this\
  \ was the beginning of the most amazing journey inside my own soul. This was the\
  \ moment I started to look the world in a entire new way, my own way and this was\
  \ the moment I discovered an espectacular Italy I`ve never seen before. \nCome with\
  \ me, to know a place where mind, soul and food walk together. Where the best wines\
  \ will open your mind to se a new world full of colors, and perspectives and people\
  \ will guide you to a culture full of particularities."
