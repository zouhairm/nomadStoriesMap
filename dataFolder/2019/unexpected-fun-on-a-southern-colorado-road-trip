Text: "I\u2019ve always hated road trips. Every summer, my parents would stuff my\
  \ brother and I in the back of our family\u2019s sedan and spend the next 16 hours\
  \ driving to my grandmother\u2019s home in Minnesota. The only sightseeing scheduled\
  \ for our trip was a series of unremarkable gas stations that blurred together like\
  \ the scenery outside my window. \n\nSo when my husband suggested we take a road\
  \ trip through southern Colorado before we moved away for the foreseeable future,\
  \ I was hesitant. Could a road trip with my husband be something fun and memorable\
  \ instead of boring and miserable? Despite my reservations, I was ready to find\
  \ out. \n\nWe first stopped in the tiny town of Creede, where we stretched our legs\
  \ by walking Main Street and filled our bellies with lunch at Kip\u2019s Grill on\
  \ the patio beneath Colorado\u2019s trademark sunny blue sky. By early afternoon\
  \ we made it to Pagosa Springs. After checking into our motel (marking my first\
  \ stay in such lodging) we went to The Springs Resort & Spa to enjoy the hot springs\
  \ the city is known for. Settling into a small pool overlooking the river running\
  \ through town, we spent the rest of the afternoon sipping cans of beer from the\
  \ Riff Raff Brewing Company and basking in the last golden rays of the day. \n\n\
  The following day we explored Durango and even made our way to the top of the mesa\
  \ where the aptly named Mesa State University is perched. I questioned my choice\
  \ in colleges as I looked out over the city of Durango and beyond; the view was\
  \ stunning. We went to Ska Brewing Company that evening where it turned out to be\
  \ Trivia Night and the perfect end to our second day. \n\nTaking Highway 160 west\
  \ out of Durango the following morning, we drove to Mesa Verde National Park to\
  \ see the famed cliff dwellings of the ancient Puebloans who used to inhabit that\
  \ part of Colorado. I was shocked at how well-preserved the ancient buildings were\
  \ and just how high up on the cliff faces the Native Americans built their homes!\
  \ \n\nAfter reveling in the history and beauty of the park, we passed through Cortez\
  \ (taking care not to blink) and followed Highway 145 north into San Juan National\
  \ Forest. My husband leaned over and pulled a map out of the glove compartment,\
  \ instructing me to navigate us to Telluride. It was the first time I had to use\
  \ a road map to get myself anywhere! But after a leisurely drive through the forest\
  \ and thanks to my new navigation skills, we emerged in Telluride. Since this was\
  \ the priciest spot on our tour, we only walked through downtown and visited their\
  \ legendary airport high on the side of a mountain. \n\nWe then drove north to Ridgeway\
  \ and after a brief stop in a local fly shop, we parked along the Uncompahgre River\
  \ and spent the rest of the afternoon fly fishing. The tiny canyon town of Ouray\
  \ was our home for the night; a 20-minute drive from our fishing spot led us right\
  \ into the downtown where we stayed at the Swiss chalet-style inn. \n\nWe rose early\
  \ the following morning to fish the Animas River. To get there? We had to drive\
  \ the infamous Million Dollar Highway, carved into the side of the mountains running\
  \ between Ouray and Silverton. Despite being sacred of the steep drop offs right\
  \ outside my door at times, this was Colorado at its finest: mountain views, changing\
  \ leaves, stunning waterfalls and abandoned mining towns. \n\nAs we wound our way\
  \ through the mountains that morning, I reflected on our trip. Even though it wasn\u2019\
  t over yet, I was already dreading its end. My nightmares of being trapped in the\
  \ backseat and fighting with my brother for the armrest were a thing of my past.\
  \ I had no idea a road trip through my own backyard could be so much fun! And with\
  \ destinations loosely in mind, not feverishly adhered to, there was so much time\
  \ to stop and enjoy what makes the journey memorable. Because of this journey I\
  \ now know the true definition of a road trip."
