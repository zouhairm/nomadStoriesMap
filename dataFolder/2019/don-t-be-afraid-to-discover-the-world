Text: "I was 18 when I first travel alone outside my country and along with people\
  \ that I never knew them before! It was a 3 day trip from Romania, the city of Bacau\
  \ to Italy on the island of Sardinia, in a small village near Olbia. Romania is\
  \ a beautiful country but for me at that time was everything I knew. I imagined\
  \ that what is outside my country is an SF world!   \nThis was 13 years ago but\
  \ still so fresh in my mind! I remember that my father opposes so much because of\
  \ the dangerous things that can happen. As you all know the countries I have to\
  \ cross aren't the safest ones for a girl at that time: prostitution was huge by\
  \ that time and many girls were Romanians, taken without their will and make them\
  \ do this job, this is just an example... But my dream was big, I can make it, I\
  \ will arrive on my destination save and I did! \nAnd yes I did see these scenes\
  \ in the city of Padua, in the middle of the night and it was something typically\
  \ like our driver informed us. Was a shocking moment for me, who always thought\
  \ that people are good, this was a strong example of reality.\n\nBut this didn't\
  \ destroy my wish to explore more and more, good or bad, beautiful or ugly, actually\
  \ was just an eye-opening for what was coming in the next years!\nI force myself\
  \ not to sleep so much so I can see everything, to find from my window the life\
  \ of the villages, towns and to imagine the life of the people that I see. Most\
  \ of them were simple, working hard on their fields and this remembers my country\
  \ and I was thinking maybe we are not so different after all!\nOnce arriving at\
  \ my destinations I change my mind. Nature was fabulous, food was different, fresh\
  \ with divine aromas; the smell of the sea and the people... They were different...was\
  \ something that makes you feel home even you are a stranger! I found out that I\
  \ can speak Italian using my hands and that is very similar to my native language.\
  \  I understand those little things, like dinner with the family, are so important\
  \ and I saw how these links together generations.  \nThis trip changed my view and\
  \ after that, I decided to visit as many countries I can and discover as many cultures\
  \ as possible so now, 13 years later I am proud to say that I visited 11 countries\
  \ and I lived in 5. After each visit, I share my experience to make sure that those\
  \ people who are like I was before gain courage and interest to exit outside home\
  \ country and discover our beautiful world."
