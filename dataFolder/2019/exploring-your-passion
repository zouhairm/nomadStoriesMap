Text: "With a backpack that exceeded my physical capabilities, credit card with a\
  \ small limit and a guide book, but no plan I was looking for the right gate to\
  \ the Canadian Rockies. Afraid, but smiling, I was trying to develop trust in my\
  \ own abilities to manage a working holiday experience. With the same power that\
  \ the true Canadian winter storm welcomed me with, I was hit by the words I was\
  \ taught: \u201CIf you want to travel you need to learn to trust people.\u201D\n\
  \nProbably going way beyond  the meaning of the advice, in the middle of a country\
  \ night I simply said yes to a night adventure hike in Kananaskis nature park. Discovering\
  \ the hidden wildlife treasure of Alberta region on cross country skis, imagining\
  \ the tour and challenging myself, that sounded like me.\n\nHard to say, if it was\
  \ the minus 20 degrees or us together and alone for the first time that made me\
  \ look through the exciting emotions. Having a ride home, offering him a cup of\
  \ tea while changing the western outfit for backpack, made me realise, that he is\
  \ a complete stranger to me. Pretending to be comfortable with the situation was\
  \ contrary to my feelings.\n \nSooner than I wished, a sliding ride on a winding\
  \ road ended. I maintained my lady heart inside of the adventurous soul, but I was\
  \ not prepared for the outdoor experience.  However, having neither enough clothes,\
  \ neither glasses or charged flash light, turned out to be a good strategy to find\
  \ out the personality of your hiking partner. He lent me his spare clothes, starting\
  \ with gloves, ending with big trousers and jacket. On the other hand it made me\
  \ wonder, why he is carrying so many things in his car. My supplies, that consisted\
  \ of two bananas and tea, were nothing compared to his satellite phone and first\
  \ aid kid. \n\nThe biggest surprise was when he put his touring skis on, which after\
  \ the first few metres appeared to make a big difference in the deep snow. An intermediate\
  \ hike to Chester lake turned out to be a challenging climb, especially when my\
  \ poles without baskets were disappearing in the powder snow. Although we were walking\
  \ quietly, the way we were cooperating gave us a chance to support each other to\
  \ safely accomplish our tour. The Last two open snow fields felt like the strongest\
  \ shot of espresso, that pushed our abilities beyond our expectations. I felt so\
  \ cold, I wasn\u2019t even able to move my fingers. The view to the lake under the\
  \ moonlight was breathtaking, as it was surrounded by wildlife, I understood what\
  \ the danger is here. \n\nWe were wary of camping over night, We knew that we were\
  \ not welcome, especially in the middle of the night. We were hungry, but as soon\
  \ as we heard sounds coming from the forest; we knew we couldn\u2019t eat there.\
  \ Wolves, coyotes and cougars, who you can\u2019t normally see, but they can smell\
  \ you for a long distance. We shared the last drops of tea, because mine spilled\
  \ out in backpack, directly on my spare clothes. We were so exhausted, hungry and\
  \ we were shaking from the freezing temperature. Trying to build a small snow shelter\
  \ to have a rest for a while didn\u2019t work out so we decided to return. \n\n\
  Our trail was already snowbound, the moon was covered with clouds and wind started\
  \ changing the peaceful place into a mysterious and scary one. My legs were hurting\
  \ while I was trying to brake in the steep hill. I couldn\u2019t feel my fingers\
  \ and my view was blurred. When I could not see him in front of me, I imagined all\
  \ kinds of scary scenarios.\n\nThe clock showed 3:40 am. It took him a few minutes\
  \ to plan the adventure but a couple of hours to share his life story. This amazing\
  \ adventure could have turned out the opposite for me. I had a chance to discover\
  \ such untouched wildlife with an experienced mountain climber, however I have to\
  \ admit that I overstepped the unknown. Maybe fulfilling our desires might be about\
  \ taking chances challenging our limits."
