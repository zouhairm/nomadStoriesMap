Text: "Making my way through the haggling touts, I looked for a comparatively calmer\
  \ spot to think through the entire situation. I had come with the intention of keeping\
  \ my first solo trip so unplanned that it seemed straight out of an adventure book.\
  \ Now, I stood there feeling disoriented, more so after the just ended brawl with\
  \ a 'dharmshala' owner who I had offended (God knows how!) by being completely on\
  \ my own in a far-away city. He had scoffed at my request for a room to put up.\
  \ To him, I was a runaway and he couldn\u2019t take the risk. This was preceded\
  \ by a scuffle with a handicapped commuter who was acting way too perverted for\
  \ any sympathy. Any trace of pity I had for him was replaced by an urgent desire\
  \ to smack him heavily across the jaw. URGH! I felt so low on confidence. This was\
  \ nowhere close to the fancy imaginations of my first solo travel. \nVrindavan\u2026\
  a name that reeks of holiness\u2026a city where the perpetual chant of mantras echoes\
  \ through the air. The land is engulfed in tales from Lord Krishna\u2019s life.\
  \ Here, you don\u2019t walk for long without sighting a temple, a devout with rosemary\
  \ or being bothered by a monkey. Here, you don\u2019t say \u2018Namaste\u2019 to\
  \ someone you meet or thank you to a person who has been kind to you. All expressions\
  \ of greeting, thankfulness, attention, and apology melt into the pious utterings\
  \ of \u2018Radhe Radhe\u2019, the name of Krishna\u2019s beloved. In the most mundane\
  \ of sights, I got a glimpse of the city\u2019s age-old legacy. I shrugged off my\
  \ disappointment. I had no intention of feeling crestfallen for no fault of mine.\n\
  As much as Vrindavan is the city of Lord Krishna and his devotees, so it is of monkeys.\
  \ The streets were infested with them, driving people to nest their balconies and\
  \ terrace to keep them at bay. I hadn\u2019t walked for 15 minutes when a rickshaw\
  \ driver talking to me in an urgent tone drew my attention.\n\u201CMa\u2019am, remove\
  \ your glasses or these monkeys\u2026\u201D\nBefore I could make sense out of his\
  \ words, a monkey leapt on me, very deftly removed my spectacles like it had been\
  \ doing this to every other person who passed by and went up a tree. I shrieked\
  \ in dismay.\nThe man quickly fetched a packet of juice from a nearby store and\
  \ dangled it before the creature. Clearly, it was a good deal and the monkey traded\
  \ my glasses for the juice, disposing of the pair on a heap of garbage. Though short-lived,\
  \ the spectacle had attracted passers-by who now went about their business after\
  \ a bout of laughter. The encounter had jolted my belonging out of shape and one\
  \ of the lenses now rested at an angle of 45 degrees. I spent several minutes working\
  \ on it, all the while muttering curses on the mischievous little creature that\
  \ was busy savoring the juice. \n\u201CWhere were you headed?\u201D \nThat backpack\
  \ and baffled expression of mine were enough to suggest I was new to the place.\
  \ His curiosity gave way to concern when he learned I was on my own. \u201CYou could\
  \ come with us. I am taking a group of tourists on a sightseeing trip. They are\
  \ off to a temple right now.\u201D I realized this would also buy me time to plan\
  \ my next move. I agreed, knowing little that henceforth, would begin a trip wherein\
  \ I would also sleep on the road for want of shelter, get kicked by nasty people,\
  \ be almost crushed to death in a temple by an enthusiastic crowd of pseudo devotees.\
  \ But, for all those times that I was let down, I also crossed paths with people\
  \ who treated me as their own, who felt that my well-being was their responsibility\
  \ too and who would walk the extra mile to resolve my troubles. With them did I\
  \ walk 30 kilometers barefoot on end,  purging myself on a pilgrimage. \nIn retrospect,\
  \ every encounter, sweet or sour, was meant to add to my treasure trove of memories.\
  \ I\u2019d rather leave my comfortable bucket list unchecked for experiences that\
  \ would exhaust pages when penned down."
