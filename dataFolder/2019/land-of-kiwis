Text: "Culture, differences, change, religion. Those are all things you expect to\
  \ see when you travel across the world, right? \nThankfully, New Zealand is full\
  \ of culture, huge with differences and overflowing with change and religion. \n\
  The country has a rich history and an incredible Maori culture, and not to mention\
  \ the locals are some of the most friendly people I\u2019ve ever come across. There\
  \ are so many reasons to add New Zealand to your travel bucket list!\n\_ \_ \_ \_\
  \ \_ A big DONT when heading down to New Zealand is that\_unless you value your\
  \ life, or want to make friends with any kiwis while in NZ, dont badmouth rugby.\
  \ In New Zealand it is incredibly big, and they take huge pride in their countries\
  \ team; the All Blacks. Try and go to a match and you will quickly learn what rugby\
  \ means to them.\n\nSpeaking of the term \"kiwis\", where did that come from? Well\
  \ New Zealanders have been called 'Kiwis' since the nickname was given to them by\
  \ Australian soldiers in the First World War. \nIt relates back to the Kiwi bird,\
  \ who is a flightless bird with no tail, loose hair-like feathers and strong legs.\
  \ The residents of New Zealand are working hard to prevent the Kiwi bird from going\
  \ extinct, because there are only 5 species left in the world! Incredible right!\
  \ Oh and they're super cute as well in person! \n\nLong story short I have no bad\
  \ words to say about this unreal country. This amazing piece of land, surrounded\
  \ by the Southern Pacific, may be a world away...literally, but I can guarntee you\
  \ that it is worth every step you take to reach it...and penny. It has some of the\
  \ most amazing natural beauty, down to earth and welcoming people, and a culture\
  \ that is truly one of a kind, it should be at the top of any serious traveler's\
  \ destination bucket list."
