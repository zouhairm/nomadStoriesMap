Text: "The farm was unassuming, but his smile was not. \nBombing through the dusty\
  \ roads of Salento, the famed coffee capital of Colombia, with the amber sun setting\
  \ over verdant fields made for the perfect introduction. By this time I was incredibly\
  \ late as I made my way to Finca La Esperanza. I took a little while to convince\
  \ a Jeep taxi driver to take me out there as it was the furthest stop on his route\
  \ and encroaching on dinner time. I was lucky to make it to the farm, and very lucky\
  \ to make a connection with it\u2019s owner, Alberto.\nWaiting at the end of the\
  \ driveway was \nAlberto with his black cat Sol by his side. From the glow of the\
  \ headlights I could see him waving frantically with what would become that famous\
  \ beaming smile. \u201CHola, Hola! Bienvenido a su casa.\u201D He took my bags from\
  \ me to bring to my room and helped to set up the kitchen so I could cook a quick\
  \ meal before bed. It was a whirlwind of a meeting, but he said it best. I already\
  \ knew I was home. \nThe next day began all too familiarly. My crackling eyes open\
  \ to see his arm flailing back and forth. We began the day picking oranges from\
  \ the massive tree behind his antique hacienda farmhouse. We pressed some fresh\
  \ juice for our morning breakfast and set up a table outside to enjoy the beautiful\
  \ morning sun. Now I could finally ask Alberto about his farm and the day ahead.\
  \ All I had to do was ask one question and the next thing you know we have left\
  \ behind the juice to taste some Colombian field berries and say hi to his not so\
  \ friendly geese. The passion Alberto has for his farm is overflowing. \nHe was\
  \ quick to point out that it was not a coffee farm at all. His pride and joy was\
  \ actually his herd of cows! Even though I had traveled to Colombia\u2019s coffee\
  \ regi\xF3n that didn\u2019t matter to me because what I saw was rich, fragarent,\
  \ flourishing farm benefitting from tender love and care. \nHe encouraged me to\
  \ go down to the river that ran through his grass fields. Scurrying past the locking\
  \ gaze of the bulls, I found a quiet pool to bathe in. In the distance I could see\
  \ Alberto tending to some weeds. \nI couldn\u2019t help but think how different\
  \ our life experiences were. Here he was, caring for the same piece of land passed\
  \ down through generations, happy as can be. Later he told me he had lived on the\
  \ southern coast of Ecuador to escape Colombia during some more troubled times.\
  \ As every year passed it killed him being away from his farm. Once he returned\
  \ it was through the sheer power of love that he willed it back to life. And now,\
  \ all he wanted to do was share that love with others. I was mesmerized by this\
  \ story he told me on the first night as I sat by his bedside with Sol purring in\
  \ my lap. \nEvery day Alberto showed me something new on his farm. He shared his\
  \ plan for clearing more land for his cows, shared a glass of warm milk right from\
  \ the udder, and his thoughts about actually growing more coffee beans to sell in\
  \ town. \nThree days wisped away and it was time for me to go. Or so I thought!\
  \ He said I should wait for his sister to come later that afternoon with the grandkids.\
  \ Now, his sister Patricia was serving the BEST fried chicken ever while two little\
  \ nuggets were bubbling around the lawn. Three days turned into an unforgettable\
  \ six, and it broke my heart to see his smile shut and a tear roll down his cheek\
  \ as we embraced before the Jeep took me away. That amber sun was setting once more,\
  \ and I had never felt so warm. Alberto taught me something truly special. Keep\
  \ your heart wide open and share your passion with others. A photo we had taken\
  \ together with the whole family, our family, now sits framed on my dresser! This\
  \ connection will last forever."
