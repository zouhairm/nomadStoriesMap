Text: "It's been a while since I traveled anywhere. It's been more than a while since\
  \ I went anywhere alone. Thus, an all-by-myself wine night I can hardly remember\
  \ now, turned into a trip I'll hardly ever forget. I've been in love with Barcelona\
  \ since the first time I saw it. And I hated my job at that time. For these two\
  \ reasons I quit and bought a one-way ticket to my beloved city.\n\nI got to the\
  \ hostel around 1 a.m., tired and hungry. My only wish was to sleep, but dreams\
  \ don't always come true, do they? Instead, I met a group of people talking and\
  \ drinking who invited me to join them. Honestly, I didn't mind. I wanted to find\
  \ a soul mate or at least someone I could talk to. \n\nA Scottish alcoholic and\
  \ a French Apollo were a company that had a beneficial effect on my heart. A Mexican\
  \ bar & Argentinean dances at 3 a.m. were the things that influenced on our decision\
  \ to go on a 3-day trip to Andorra.  Shamefully, I didn't even know where Andorra\
  \ was situated. But I still said \"Yes\".\n\nThe next morning we felt really bad.\
  \ Bad for drinking too much. Bad for going to sleep too late. Bad for making such\
  \ a weird decision. Nevertheless, we took a car and headed to the Spanish border.\
  \ We've listened to Papa Mali for hours, talking, drinking, sleeping, laughing,\
  \ arguing, taking pictures and playing games. We said \"F**k you\" to each other\
  \ more than in \"Pulp Fiction\" and we still fell in love with each other. When\
  \ I was a child, I used to ask my mum why I'd never be able to have an elder brother.\
  \ She sort of explained, but I outwitted her because I've got two brothers now.\n\
  \nThe Scotsman is crazy. Dirty hair, torn pants, and a never-ending cigarette in\
  \ his fingers. You admire him because he is sincere. You want to talk to him because\
  \ he makes you laugh.  The Frenchman is really handsome. He is a hipster but I prefer\
  \ to call him a gentleman .He has a mirror in his pocket, and he will gently fold\
  \ his socks before swimming in the lake. But this, probably, what's called \"charm\"\
  . Besides, he is reliable, helpful and witty. \n\nHave you ever heard about  abandoned\
  \ cities? There is a small village named Viuet in the North of Spain - the village\
  \ you will hardly ever find on Google maps. That was the place we headed to.\n\n\
  \ By the time we reached it, it was already dark. We left the car in the forest\
  \ and went to the mountains to explore the area. It took us 2 hours and 5 km up\
  \ the mountains to get to the place we've been looking for. Suddenly, it started\
  \ raining really hard. Honestly, I got scared. At that exact moment I realized that\
  \ I was in the middle of nowhere with people I don't really know with no documents\
  \ or ideas of what to do if things got worse. My phone was dead.\n\nWe've decided\
  \ to put up a tent. The Scotsman made a fire and we cooked some food. We also had\
  \ 2 bottles of wine so in an hour the situation didn't seem that awful to me anymore.\
  \ The next morning all my fears and doubts disappeared. I remember myself standing\
  \   on the  very edge of the highest mountain, while the clouds were floating beneath\
  \ me, completely scanned by the sun. An indescribable feeling.\n\nIn 2 days I had\
  \ to come back to Barcelona. Surprisingly, I felt sad. The guys felt sad, too. I\
  \ felt like we were losing a part of something very important. I felt lost & confused.\
  \ A couple of days later I got rid of that deep feeling of being lost and felt fearlessness\
  \ and independence. \n\nAs for the abandoned village, we never got there. We never\
  \ found it. We never regretted about it. I've had enough courage to go nowhere with\
  \ the two most interesting people I ever met in my life. And that was one of the\
  \ best decisions I ever made."
