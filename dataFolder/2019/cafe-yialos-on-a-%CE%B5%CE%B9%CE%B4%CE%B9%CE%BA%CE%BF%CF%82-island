Text: "The large ferry arrived in the afternoon as Carlos and I took our first advantageously\
  \ dreaming sight of Mykonos. With this first glance we assumed the port was close\
  \ to town. \n\nUpon arrival we went up to the main road and started walking. It\
  \ was here that we realised our self-inflicted trap. We were literally heading onto\
  \ what would become nothing but road, with many kilometers ahead for our journey\
  \ unknown.\n\nAfter a moment of silent resilience, we returned to the port, comprehending\
  \ how we didn\u2019t have the stamina to race local traffic by foot and within minutes\
  \ we hailed down a taxi driver.\n\nUpon arrival to a hotel atop an arduous hill,\
  \ we met our welcoming receptionist and booked into our two night stay on the island.\n\
  \nIt was part of our whirlwind journey to Greece. First we would see a few Greek\
  \ Islands being Syros, Naxos and Mykonos and then see the endemic power of Athens\
  \ with a final train north to view the rock formations of Meteora.\n\nWe wandered\
  \ along the winding alleyways of Mykonos, as blue and white filled our visual senses.\n\
  \nThe tight knit edifices of Little Venice suddenly opened out to the broad Mediterranean\
  \ Sea. Water collided with the fa\xE7ades of old homes, as the turquoise drops returned\
  \ into the water body again.\n\nWe, Carlos and I, started dating years ago but had\
  \ survived the effects of long distance romance. I was Australian and he was Brazilian,\
  \ something you imagine could not have been easy with such distance. Being on this\
  \ stunning Greek Island, as tourist low season began, was our mission to continue\
  \ an adoration of travel with blooming love.\n\nWe arrived to a destination for\
  \ creating our first lunch on this delicate island. Here was the Old Port with an\
  \ open thoroughfare where restaurants and the sea meet to tantalize visitors and\
  \ comparatively less of them at this time of year. \n\nAs we walked along the promenade,\
  \ we thought of where was best placed to taste food from the region and country.\
  \ When travelling, I always love to taste the exquisite local delicacies to feel\
  \ freshness from the local trees, factories, produce and water deities.\n\nWe passed\
  \ back toward the beginning of the street and thought about going into a local Greek\
  \ caf\xE9 and eatery known as Caf\xE9 Yialos. \n\nUpon entering I pulled out my\
  \ white wooden chair and thought of our first need on this island paradise, \u2018\
  a bottle of house red wine please!\u2019 mentioned confidently to the Waitress.\n\
  \nAs we sat and waited for the wine, I began to listen through my ears to the sweet\
  \ sound of Greek locals chatting in the place, and read the many tastes that could\
  \ be experienced in this eating house.\n\nThe menu was full of exquisite local delicacies\
  \ like much prized Tzatziki, a starter on any meal in Greece, according to me.\n\
  \nFollowing my yoghurt infused place setting, we began to look at other flavours\
  \ to excite the tongue for our relaxing Mykonos time. I looked and saw meatballs,\
  \ locally known as Keftedes. I selected these, along with a side of a delicious\
  \ eggplant lasagna style meal known as Moussaka.\n\nOnce placed before me the fork\
  \ ignited my tastebuds in a way I adored, sparking a connection to this land.\n\n\
  After our comforting local meal, we decide to go for an ice cream at the place next\
  \ door.\n\nWe spoke to the local proprietors and chatted about low season on this\
  \ tourism infused island.\n\nUpon exiting the store we sat calmly as the sea breeze\
  \ lay before us and we licked our desserts delicately by the Mediterranean.\n\n\
  It was a great local experience, constructed slowly through the place and onward\
  \ into the Greek tastes as the island took us back to contemplation of travel. Travel\
  \ breathes a life I love from the ancient communities of these islands through to\
  \ the contemporary experiences of Greece, what an amazing experience in one easy\
  \ carefree day.\n\nI will never taste Greek food the same way again."
