Text: "Flying over a thousand miles I came across a city with a tremendous history\
  \ and heritage. The dusty fog and infectious flies of Delhi was an unexpected welcome\
  \ which was long forgotten as we walked down the streets bustling with festive stalls,\
  \ families and friends with happiness radiating out of them, but I was mesmerized\
  \ by how diversified these residents were, a Mosque calling for prayer, a temple\
  \ of Lord Krishna, a church where Jesus Christ and his mother are worshipped and\
  \ a Sikh temple crowded by people of all religions preparing for the meals. Such\
  \ an overwhelming sight!!\n\nDelhi being a capital for more than thousand years\
  \ resembles the many victorious battles and marvellous monuments that proudly stand\
  \ to describe the proud history. Some monuments are Jama Masjid, Red Fort, India\
  \ Gate and many more. These monuments held nothing but hard work, pride, beauty,\
  \ intelligence, love and sacrifice.\n\nMy educational trip so happened to be in\
  \ between Dussehra (a Hindu festival) and Eid-Al-Adha, the local markets were turned\
  \ into a little carnival. The beauty of a diversified community and festival was\
  \ something great to discover and live for. The more I learn the more connected\
  \ I felt, but the most fascinating part was about to begin.\n\nA day prior to Eid-Al-Adha\
  \ is celebrated as \u201CArafat Day\u201D where all Muslims are obliged to fast\
  \ (in the name of The All Mighty Allah) thus, I decided to fast for the day, fortunately\
  \ we had the supper of the fast in Jama Masjid (a prayer hall for Muslims) and further\
  \ continued our trip to Red Fort, Agra Fort and last but not the least the Akshardham\
  \ Temple. The trip was about to change lives.\n\nBy the time we reached our last\
  \ destination, the temple, it was almost dawn and everyone was exhausted and sweaty,\
  \ but what surprised us was the crazy crowd that ensured us at least three hours\
  \ wait. After four hours waiting in queue and security checking we entered the temple\
  \ but the actual temple as a mile away, fasting took a toll on my body, drained\
  \ out and hungry with long travel and humidity. I encouraged my group to go ahead\
  \ and for me to rest. By the time I realized I was the time for Azaan (call) to\
  \ break the fast, realization dawned to me.\n\nI a Muslim, was currently in a Hindu\
  \ Temple! I was well aware of the feud between Muslims and Hindus for years and\
  \ concluded that no one would help me and mustered all the strength to go in search\
  \ of water at least. After ten minutes I found myself almost slipping into unconscious\
  \ after a sixteen hour fast supporting myself near to the wall and prayed, perhaps,\
  \ for a miracle.\n\nA figure approached me, I sucked in a deep breathe in fear that\
  \ they will hurt me as they have already taken in my Muslim attire. To say I was\
  \ surprised would be an understatement, a Pandit (caretaker of a temple) asked if\
  \ I was fasting. I suddenly felt the overwhelming feeling to tell them everything\
  \ which I did, he suddenly stood up and brought water, milk and fruits and raised\
  \ the cup near me to drink it but suddenly halted his actions.\n\nThe Pandit asked\
  \ a bystander to check the Azaan timings and helped me in completing my fast on\
  \ time, traditionally and with contentment. The orthodox belief was forever erased\
  \ and the newborn respect and love for them bloomed. The understanding and the belief\
  \ of helpfulness brought me into a new light of loving and helping others to no\
  \ extent, to no barriers. The Pandit further explained to me how Muslims once helped\
  \ a Hindu woman in delivering the baby and how the Muslims protected a sacred temple.\n\
  \nSitting the plane and flying back to Dubai, I realized how connected I feel to\
  \ Delhi and its residents. A mere stranger taught me humanity and love for others\
  \ with no barriers and most importantly made me realize the beauty of the world\
  \ just by a simple action. I was returning home with a life long lesson and a contented\
  \ heart."
