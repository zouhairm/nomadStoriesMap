Text: "I spent a year traveling to a different city in Southern Italy every week.\
  \ I danced with Romani (commonly known as gypsies) until well after midnight on\
  \ New Years, until the sounds of gunshots and explosions drove us inside. I dined\
  \ with Mafia in an all-marble home. On a separate occasion, I dined with ex-mafia\
  \ in their two-room plywood scanty. On a three month visit to Sardegna, I was stalked\
  \ so severely that I had to flee the island. In the heart of catholicism, I read\
  \ the Bible cover-to-cover three times.\n\nItalians are incredibly prideful people.\
  \ Where on earth is better than Italy? You can't eat better anywhere else in the\
  \ world. You won't find a place so deeply connected to their ancestors because no\
  \ where else on earth is every male in a bloodline named \"Daniele Esposito\" traced\
  \ all the way back to when the first baby without a name was left at that convents\
  \ doorstep in Napoli. \n\nBari presented its own personality. A non-denominational\
  \ Christian group adopted me as one of their own during my two month rest there.\
  \ I visited their disciples in neighboring cities once a week and listened to their\
  \ sermons dutifully. I took on teaching their children English, even though they\
  \ insisted that I was teaching them \"American\" because my accent wasn't quite\
  \ right. \"How do you speak Italian so clearly but you can't spell in English correctly?\"\
  . \n\nOnce, the famiglia Pappagallo, brought me into the city center to try \"the\
  \ best pistachio gelato outside of bitonto\". We spent the evening there, strolling\
  \ along lungomare, window-shopping with leisure as I had forgotten my wallet. We\
  \ rested on a bench in centro, gelato in hand, lazily swatting at pigeons that got\
  \ too close to the children. Sorella Pappagallo taught me the word for napkin (tovagliolo)\
  \ and we grabbed the bus back to their home, where they graciously let me stay.\
  \ \n\nThe bus ride home was nothing out of the ordinary, we drove so close to pedestrians,\
  \ I couldve brushed elbows with them. I perused my copy of the Bible but wasn't\
  \ fully able to focus until a group of controllers got on the bus. Normally, not\
  \ a big deal. But my monthly bus pass was in my wallet that I had left at the Pappagallo's\
  \ home. Suddenly my bible became an extreme focus as I was literally praying that\
  \ I was only kicked off the bus and not issued a ticket. Funny how spending a year\
  \ in Italy drains you of all your funds. \n\nThe controller asked Sorella Pappagallo\
  \ for her pass and she gave it to him. He then asked for mine. \n\"ticket?\"\n\"\
  I'm sorry, I forgot my wallet at home.\" \nSorella Pappagallo vouched for me.\n\"\
  You can't ride the bus without a ticket.\"\n\"I know,\" I said. \"I do have one.\"\
  \n\"You can buy a new ticket or I'll ask you to step off.\" \nI explained one more\
  \ time that I didn't have my wallet and therefore couldn't buy a ticket.\n \nThe\
  \ controller reached into his pocket and instead of issuing me a ticket, he pulled\
  \ out his own wallet and with his own euro he paid for a one-ride only pass. That\
  \ controller taught me more about the Italian devotion to Jesus Christ than almost\
  \ anyone I have ever met because he was living it. He could've simply not charged\
  \ me. But he had so much mercy that he ensured I'd encounter no trouble in the future\
  \ either. \n\nI left Italy just a little more superstitious than when I arrived.\
  \ I believe that you can cross the road at virtually any point in time as long as\
  \ you choose the right car to dash in front of (pandas: yes, red fiats: no, buses:\
  \ yes, in Sicily alone). I believe that wishing good fortune, brought its opposite\
  \ but rather that good things come \"from the mouth of the wolf\". I believe that\
  \ the sign of the cross baked into leavened dough, made it much more palatable.\
  \ Do not stand under air conditioning. The further you are from Sicily, the worse\
  \ the food is. Napoli is simultaneously heaven and hell. Do not ever say the word\
  \ \"mafia\" out loud. And always say your prayers."
