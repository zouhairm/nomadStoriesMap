Text: "I'm a Balinese girl, live in Denpasar city but now Iive in Palu for continued\
  \ my study. I have had a crush, the first crush in my life, we met at the chess\
  \ competition in Palu, Central Sulawesi  Province, Indonesia. A tall man with black\
  \ eyes and white skin. It was really fast and we didn\u2019t have enough time to\
  \ talk. Then he promised me to invite me to go to his village, he said I will be\
  \ surprised. The date comes he said his village name is Gintu in Bada, South Lore\
  \ sub-district, in Poso regency, Central Sulawesi province and it was really easy\
  \ to find on google maps, I think it will not so challenging for going to a new\
  \ place, so I went there with my bro, I was so excited but also a bit scared at\
  \ the same time cause I heard some issues if the way to go to that village is a\
  \ terrorist nest. I didn\u2019t realize if the terrain will be so bad, we used a\
  \ motorbike but it died when we start to climb a mountain. We need to climb a mountain\
  \ with a steep incline and full of mist. We just can see the dead trees all around,\
  \ and the temperature just around 2 degrees Celcius.  There is no one besides the\
  \ sound of crows.\n    Although the situation and the terrain so bad, we still not\
  \ give up. After some terrible roads which full of mud, we arrived in a village\
  \ named Bewa, three villages before Gintu village. Normally I never so shock with\
  \ what I saw when I traveled, more amazed than shock sometimes. But this village,\
  \ have a thing that hard to find in another place. It\u2019s so ancient, the plant,\
  \ the society houses, or how the society looks like. You can see a lot of Equisetum\
  \ giganteum, shrubs, and some ancient plants with a big size. All the houses just\
  \ made by weeds for the roof and woods for the wall, and the people still use clothes\
  \ made by tree bark. It just makes you feel like in a different dimension, nostalgic\
  \ to an ancient place that you just saw in your history books in school. \n    After\
  \ Bewa village, you will meet Bomba and Bulili villages and then my destination,\
  \ Gintu village, I was trying to call him but it\u2019s so hard to find a signal\
  \ and when I can connect, he not take my call at all. And the bad things he also\
  \ not searched for me or maybe he doesn't really care. I was very confused, my bro\
  \ also cannot do anything. And it\u2019s a bit hard to find people that can speak\
  \ Indonesian, most of them just use their mother language. It feels like we are\
  \ trapped, and didn\u2019t have any direction. Then we just strolling around the\
  \ village hoping I found my friend, but we can\u2019t found him, but we found some\
  \ megalithic sites. It\u2019s so lucky to find another traveler when we enjoy the\
  \ sites. A big stone sculpted in human shape but holding his genitals. \n    Until\
  \ sunset I still didn\u2019t found him, yeah we didn\u2019t have any relationship\
  \ yet, and maybe just me that feel if I crush him but he is not. After all, it is\
  \ not his fault, it is me who became a dumb girl that accepted for going somewhere\
  \ that I don\u2019t know and full of strange and creepy things. But so far I didn\u2019\
  t feel disappointed, the problem was it is so hard for going back home."
