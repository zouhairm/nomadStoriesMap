Text: "In April of 2015 I was fortunate enough to be able to go to France, my first\
  \ major vacation out of my country, with a few fellow classmates and teacher from\
  \ my high school French class. The moment I stepped out the Charles-De Gaulle airport\
  \ in Paris, I knew I was about to have an experience of a lifetime, as seeing the\
  \ beautiful Parisian city for the first time was literally a dream come true. The\
  \ architecture in France is beautifully antiquated and not quite anything I have\
  \ ever seen in the United States, where I was born and raised. We landed in Paris\
  \ sometime in the morning and could not check in to our hotel until later that day.\
  \ Basically right off of a fifteen hour flight my French teacher walked us all around\
  \ the whole entire city. It was the best moment of my life seeing all that Paris\
  \ had to offer. I remember the first time lying my eyes on the Eiffel Tower, it\
  \ was everything I imagined it to be and more, it was a moment I would remember\
  \ for the rest of my life. The next few days we spent touring all Paris had to offer\
  \ including Le Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral and Towers (which had epically beautiful\
  \ views), Sacre Coeur (which also had amazing views as it\u2019s up on a hill and\
  \ has amazing views of the city especially at sunset/night), Champs-Elysees (which\
  \ is seriously a dream as a fashionista), Arc de Triomphe and a few local museums\
  \ and parks. We even made a day trip to Palace of Versailles, which was amazing.\
  \ It was one of the most unique experiences of my life being able to see the Hall\
  \ of Mirrors in real life, along with the rooms where King Louis and Marie-Antoinette\
  \ stayed in. It was an odd layout as their rooms only had three walls as if it was\
  \ part of some exhibition when in reality is was for when they got intimate they\
  \ could have an audience, which is so bizarre to think about. The Palace\u2019s\
  \ gardens were so extravagant and like no gardens I had ever seen before in my life,\
  \ just jaw dropping gorgeous. While we were in France we, also, visited the D-Day\
  \ beaches and toured the American Monuments, we even saw the British shoreline from\
  \ the beach. Some of the other places we visited were Rouen, St. Malo, Mont Saint\
  \ Michel and the Loire Valley. Honestly, this was an experience of a lifetime and\
  \ I forever wish I could go back to this time and my life to relive this trip as\
  \ it was the most fun I have had to date. Being in France made me realize how much\
  \ more to life there is out there as I come from a small town in Northern California\
  \ where I don\u2019t get to see much culture. In France, Paris especially, I got\
  \ to see all kinds of different people from all over the world, which makes Paris\
  \ even that more special to me. I have always been a people person and I have always\
  \ been curious about other cultures and religions and until I stepped foot in Paris,\
  \ I had been stuck in my own little world in Northern California where the majority\
  \ of people are white Christians. Walking around Paris that very first day I saw\
  \ so many different races and religions in the streets and it was amazing. Not only\
  \ is the architecture to die for and the views everything I could wish for, but\
  \ I felt as if anyone could fit in there as I don\u2019t always feel from my hometown\
  \ as it\u2019s so Conservative. Being in France, mainly Paris, made me realize how\
  \ badly I wanted to return there and possibly spend some time living abroad there.\
  \ This trip made me, also, want to explore other cities and countries abroad to\
  \ have the ability to learn even more about other cultures and peoples throughout\
  \ the world. If there\u2019s anything I could get across to other people is to get\
  \ out and travel abroad to experience other cultures to get a different perspective\
  \ on life as it is very eye opening."
