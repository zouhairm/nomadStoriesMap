Text: "From nuclear submarine stations to secret islam villages on pinnacles, from\
  \ ancient mysteries to forgotten past there is something in the air around the Balkans.\
  \ Being mixed by many different nations and religions first time is shocking in\
  \ a positive and also in a negative way. How many cultures that I had no clue about!\
  \ Gorgeous coloured hijabs, niqabs, vibrant tassels and sophisticated details were\
  \ fundamental ornaments through my trip. \nNew town is made out of concrete and\
  \ socialist realism that statued the living romance of the contemporary and classical.\
  \ Just a first conclusion. As I got nearer the downtown, I digged in the layered\
  \ tragic history between the mountains. The Latin Bridge where the first world war\
  \ started, and the shotholes on the walls from 92\u2019 and the roses of Sarajevo\
  \ kept reminding me: don\u2019t forget. The life fizzed around eerie impressions\
  \ of the war and slowly it got night.  \nAll the dawns are foggy there and most\
  \ of the days are rainy. I woke up in the authentic bosnian room filled with red\
  \ geometric patterned carpets. In the mornings mass of fog rolls down from the mountains\
  \ through cemeterys and alleys turning their colours into gray. Valleys waving around\
  \ with small streets and reckless gates on them looking like Istanbul. High M\xFC\
  ezzin towers and small groceries I walked by in the direction of the bazaar.\nOld\
  \ town with its auburn atmosphered bazaar is like an ancient emerald town inside\
  \ Sarajevo. I went through Ba\u0161\u010Dar\u0161ija to have a post-breakfast at\
  \ the well-known Baklava Shop. Got my bosnian coffee and baklavas, all made in front\
  \ of my eyes. What you can eat in Sarajevo is chevap, bosnian coffee and baklava\
  \ mostly. I went to see the Ferhadija mosque from the ottoman ages and after the\
  \ Saint Joseph\u2019s catholic Church. Felt like taking a step from Istanbul to\
  \ Europe. The bazaar is a maze for tourists, but when you got out of the nice carpets,\
  \ shotgun holes got bigger on the walls. It\u2019s a breathing city with university,\
  \ national museums, cinemas all affordable. Many bridges takes the visitor all the\
  \ way up to the old winter olympic stadium. Tickets for the most tourist attractions\
  \ are unexpectedly expensive and not worth the money. Muezzin started singing, it\
  \ got night again. Easy to get stuck between restaurants and small shops. The music\
  \ of Zdravko Colic filled the alleys next to the Habsburg styled inns and Tesla\
  \ blinked from every graffiti. \nI took a trip by train down to Mostar. A journey\
  \ through grey naked peaks with snowcaps on them. River Neretva there hide and seeks\
  \ under viadukts creating small or wide lakes as a lace cloth from above. Tiny villages\
  \ are hiding in valleys while I arrived right into the hot summer mediterranean.\
  \ Huge cross stood on the highest point saved the town and showed the Christian\
  \ majority. The small streets are not prepared for that insane crowd that are on\
  \ the streets twentyfour seven. I had to dig deeper into the atmosphere to find\
  \ something that is not that touristy. A cube stone with graffiti on it that said:\
  \ \u201EDon\u2019t forget\u201D. But tourists often forget. Forget about the bloody\
  \ history and the Mostar bridge, that is not even the original because it was ruined\
  \ in the 1990\u2019s. Old bridge\u2019s stones are in the bottom of the Neretva\
  \ or on the side of it. I headed back to Sarajevo by train. At night it\u2019s eerie\
  \ between robust mountains and the shot holes got bigger on the houses from the\
  \ outskirts. The road from the massive soviet train station to my apartment I took\
  \ by tram which is old but feels retro. The highway code is: there is no highway\
  \ code.\nThe last night was magical. Staring from above to the city, drinking turkish\
  \ tea under lanterns was really unique. My hosts were trying to spend most of the\
  \ time with me when they saw me outside so I was connected with them. I did not\
  \ expect to find a single country at the mediterranean Europe where are that many\
  \ religions living together in such a peaceful world."
