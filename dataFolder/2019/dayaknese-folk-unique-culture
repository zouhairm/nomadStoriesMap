Text: So let me tell about my travel story . On 2017 i explore Bangkal village( in
  Central Borneo, Indonesia) which is one of culture tourists attraction. So there
  was the culture is so pure they live so simple like just in small house but they
  look so happy. So i see Tiwah Ceremony( Dayaknese funeral rituals)  for the first
  the dead body is on grave about 3-5 month and then they take the bones from the
  grave after that they build like human statue and small house from wood. And then
  they kill a.k.a sacrife animal like buffalo,pig,chicken,and cow. The buffalo,pig,and
  chicken is tied on a wood then some man try to kill them slowly like they hit with
  tombak(a knive but have a long handgrip) till they dead and they take the blood
  from the neck and spread it to the bones and they pack the bones and take to into
  small house that they build before. The folk cook the animal after finish ritual
  and eat it together . And at the last they present traditional dance. Its actually
  so scary but its really unique culture I've seen! They believe that the ritual will
  take the dead person to the heaven. It also the most expensive ritual that is about
  3-5 billion indonean rupiah. I really want to see it again but its so rarely to
  do. After that i try to communicate with local person and just make interaction,
  they are really nice but sme of them can't speak indonesia or English they just
  use local language that make me difficult to understand what they talking about.
  I think its enough its really great travel experience i've do!
