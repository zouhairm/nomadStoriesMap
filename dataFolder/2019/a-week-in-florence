Text: "It all started at the train station in Florence when I got off the train and\
  \ walked to the coffee shop. I said \u201COne Coffee please\u201D .. He handed me\
  \ a little shot of freshly brewed espresso and a glass of sparkling water. My Italian\
  \ dream came to life with the first sip of that flavour burst from a tiny coffee\
  \ cup! \nI walked over to my Air BnB Just short of 200 meters  from the train station\
  \ where I was greeted by Julia, a pretty girl with brown eyes and her cousin Andy.\
  \ \nJulia in her true hospitable self led me into he cozy apartment, showed me around\
  \ , sounding so cheerful. Her English which sounded so Italian made me feel so welcome\
  \ . \nI handed her a small token of love from my country, chatted for a while and\
  \ we instantly became friends. She showed me around the neighbourhood and suggested\
  \ some great places to eat . \nIt was 8 pm them and I walked to a restaurant nearby\
  \ and discovered a quaint , rustic , old pizzeria by the sidewalks of a marketplace.\
  \ \nIt was early may and slightly chilly, the aroma of the burning wood and fresh\
  \ pizza drew me inside instantly.I was greeted by a middle aged woman . She was\
  \ the daughter of the chef and explained every bit of their simple menu. I, being\
  \ vegetarian ordered a pizza with aubergines and mushrooms and a local beer. \n\
  I still can\u2019t get over the taste of that freshly baked  pizza with fresh buffalo\
  \ mozzarella. Across the street was the Cathedral Of Santa Maria del Fiore which\
  \ basked in its full glory in the moon light.\nThe next morning I was picked up\
  \ Julia s cousin Andy who also happend to be a Sommelier and offered to drive me\
  \ to \u201CI vini del  Castello \u201C a wine tasting festival in the village of\
  \ montefioralle in Tuscany.\nIt was bright and sunny and he drove as we discussed\
  \ the Italian history, food, wine and lifestyle which all seemed so dreamy and wonderful.\
  \ \nHe stopped by at the prettiest town square ever in the village of Greve In Chianti,\
  \ where nonnas spent their day making fresh bread and pasta. I devoured a bowl of\
  \ fresh fettuccine with truffles and mushrooms and a plate of tomatoes and feta\
  \ salad . I clicked a million pictures of the townspeople, the town square, the\
  \ food, and i wanted more. \nI arrived at the wine festival around 3 pm and was\
  \ greeted by a band of boys playing some local music. I bought my self a glass and\
  \ started tasting the variety of wine the region had to offer.\nI stopped by every\
  \ counter talking to the handsome men who sold their produce with so much pride.\n\
  The wine tastes delicious and I was a bit high on all the alcohol I downed admist\
  \ those conversations.\nI danced with the locals on some Italian Jazz we headed\
  \ back to Florence to Julia s apartment.\nThere is a connection with Italy and Italians\
  \ which you can only express with laughter and wine and lots of delicious food.\
  \ A country whose lifestyle is dream of every outsider.\nIt was one of my little\
  \ dreams that led me to further travel across Italy for a few weeks and create the\
  \ most memorable experience ever !!!"
