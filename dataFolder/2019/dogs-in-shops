Text: "It was only Cape Cod, and it was only four days and three nights. But still,\
  \ it was a momentary getaway. A warm, sunny excursion before school started again\
  \ in the fall. Initially, I was hesitant, figuring sharing a room with my dad for\
  \ four days would lead to demise three stories below the hotel window. However,\
  \ for the sake of my sister and cousin, I obliged to join. A true act of humanitarianism\
  \ on my part. The trip was planned according to the housewarming party for my cousin\
  \ Edwin, who I had no idea even existed prior. \nThe three and a half hours to the\
  \ hotel were fine. I had downloaded some podcasts to listen to because music was\
  \ below me at this point. This pilgrimage over the New Hampshire border to mingle\
  \ with snobby Massachusetts folk had now put in the category of traveling intellectual.\
  \ From then forth I would only read classic literature, I would only drink soy milk\
  \ that cost ten dollars a gallon. My days of being a commoner were long behind me\
  \ as we slowly putted along the clogged highway to our luxury destination: The Hampton\
  \ Inn by Hilton. By Hilton! There\u2019s no denying I was something of a Rockefeller\
  \ at this point.\nAlthough the hotel was by no means the luxurious temple my working-class\
  \ heart had hoped my working-class dad could have somehow mortgaged, it wasn\u2019\
  t a wasteland either. There was a fitness center and outdoor pool. Whereas these\
  \ are likely commonplace among the chain hotel scene, I was still very flabbergasted\
  \ by the notion. \nThe trip was a classic family weekend, we went to the housewarming\
  \ party, ate out, and all the other charming factors one would expect on such an\
  \ outing. It wasn\u2019t until the third day, however, that my life was completely\
  \ transformed. Things would never again be the same. Upon visiting some downtown\
  \ shops in New Bedford, I was met with not one, but three shop dogs. Dogs. In shops.\
  \ Although I am sure this is by no means revolutionary, I was beside myself. These\
  \ animals were public servants, opening themselves up to critique and criticism,\
  \ yet doing it so elegantly. I was dumbfounded by the pure grace of these creatures.\n\
  Suddenly it is like my life had new meaning. I now had aspirations, found in the\
  \ bright eyes of a fluff-tastic Yorkie. The wagging tongue of a massive Wolfhound.\
  \ My newest goal in life would be somehow acquiring the same pose and beauty these\
  \ animals boasted so effortlessly. I would give up all material possessions, stick\
  \ a leash around my neck, and move down to the Cape. I too would reach the level\
  \ of little boutique dog. \nHowever, the time came for us to eventually leave the\
  \ shops and retire back to our hotel. That night at the pool, at the Mexican restaurant\
  \ we stopped at for dinner, in the satisfactory hotel queen bed, all I could focus\
  \ on was the star power that these dogs possessed. They were following their dreams\
  \ in these chic brick buildings frequented by habitual Massholes and sparkly eyed\
  \ tourists. They had it all: fame, fortune, and every now and then, a head scratch.\
  \ We were all just fools, it was these fluffy companions that had their lives completely\
  \ figured out. \nBefore I knew it we were in the car heading back to the lowlifes\
  \ of New Hampshire, stuck between highway and highway. I now listened to music rather\
  \ than Podcasts. Ballads to mirror the desolation I felt when faced with the truth;\
  \ maybe I would never reach the acclaim of a shop dog. I was a measly human, a New\
  \ Hampshirite. I went along with my family for sunshine, ocean waves, and culture.\
  \ Instead, I was met with harsh reality. Shop dogs will always take the cake, while\
  \ I will be left with an empty doggy bowl and sunburnt dreams."
