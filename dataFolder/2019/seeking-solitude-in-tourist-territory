Text: "\u201CSola?\u201D the woman looked at me with wide eyes. I answered that yes,\
  \ I was traveling alone. Her elderly mother sat in the corner of the room under\
  \ a woven blanket. They asked me, concerned, why I was alone. I came to this desolate,\
  \ dry place for solitude, I explained. \u201CCuidate mija,\u201D the old woman lovingly\
  \ warned. \nOver breakfast the next morning, I learn that the younger woman\u2019\
  s name is Celia. She and her husband run the hostel. They\u2019re from Bolivia,\
  \ whose border is only 60 kilometers away from here. We\u2019re in northern Chile\u2019\
  s Atacama Desert, the most arid landscape in the world. I rise early the next morning\
  \ to watch the sun ascend behind Volcan Lincancabur. The blue-violet volcano is\
  \ always visible from the pueblo of San Pedro de Atacama, whose downtown consists\
  \ of four square blocks of one-story adobe structures, unpaved streets, and friendly\
  \ stray dogs. And tourists. My friends back in Santiago had warned me that San Pedro\
  \ was a tourist mecca. I quickly learned that it\u2019s difficult to see the scattered\
  \ landmarks without hopping in a tour van with twenty other people. I booked a couple\
  \ of tours so that I could see the \u201Cmusts\u201D\u2014geysers, unique fauna,\
  \ and turquoise lakes\u2014but my objective was to depart from the chatter and clicking\
  \ cameras and spend time with the desert, alone. \n\tSo, I rented a bike. I started\
  \ peddling at dawn, before the tours began. I biked through Valle de la Luna, where\
  \ a dirt road winds through miles of rock walls jutting up from the smooth sand.\
  \ I glided between towering rock formations and watched patches of sparkling quartz\
  \ pass beneath my tires. I dismounted periodically to walk the trails that branch\
  \ further into the valley, using Lincancabur\u2019s indigo mount to navigate when\
  \ necessary. It marks not only the border, but also east. I took a path that followed\
  \ a narrow ridge, bounded by deep ravines. Identical tan ridges repeated themselves\
  \ indefinitely in every direction except south, where stripes of white, maroon,\
  \ and purple minerals shone in the distance. Standing on the ridge, with no one\
  \ to talk to, I admired the expanse. I thought of the Chilean poet, Zurita, who\
  \ wrote, \"The Desert of Atacama soared over infinities of deserts to be there.\"\
  \ The ridges stood with me in silence, stillness, and solidarity. \n\tThe following\
  \ afternoon, after an overwhelming morning tour, I went on a jog to explore by myself.\
  \ I set off in the obvious direction: east\u2014toward the Licancabur volcano. Celia\u2019\
  s mother\u2019s words hung in my memory as I trotted out of town, past a barren\
  \ playground, around a construction site, and into the empty plains under a cloudless\
  \ sky. After a few miles, I found myself at the base of a pile of sulfur rocks.\
  \ I recognized the sulfur\u2019s burnt, salty odor. A tangled barbed wire and some\
  \ beer bottles came into view. I slowed to a walk, approaching what turned out to\
  \ be an illegal dump. I saw the black frame of a stove facing the white skeleton\
  \ of a dented washing machine. There were bedsheets half-buried in the sand, the\
  \ rusted legs of a chair without a seat, a lampshade, and a lonely pink tricycle.\
  \ Beyond, there were heaps of the same. I scanned the horizon. Lincancabur\u2019\
  s humble, snow-streaked peak looked down on the human artifacts. Burlap sacks and\
  \ grocery bags flapped in the wind, tethered by metal scraps. I felt like I was\
  \ looking at the eerie ruins of my own time. It was a jarring reminder of our consumerist\
  \ habits. We buy tricycles and fancy lamps, only to discard them and buy new ones.\
  \ The sight of the colorful sands stretching out in front of me under the desert\
  \ sun was enough to put the whole lamp enterprise out of business.\n\tWhile the\
  \ tours let me float in the salty waters of Laguna Cejar and see vicu\xF1as prancing\
  \ among tola shrubs, it was during my self-guided, solitary endeavors that I got\
  \ to know Atacama. After my final tour, I chatted with my guide, David. He\u2019\
  s from Santiago. I asked if he returns to the city often. He said, \u201CNo. Too\
  \ many people.\u201D I told him that\u2019s why I prefer traveling sola."
