Text: "Throughout the hustle and bustle of Vietnam, there can be magic in the movement.\
  \ Often the road less travelled leads to some of the most memorable travel experiences.\
  \ On this day, my three amigos and I decided to tackle a region of the Mekong Delta\
  \ in the South of Vietnam. Wanting a more authentic experience of the Mekong, we\
  \ decide to embark on this journey self guided and not sign up with any tourist\
  \ an agency. Though tourism has it financials benefits to the country, some of the\
  \ trips provided by tourist agency can lack the cultural and nostalgic taste of\
  \ true travel.\n\nThe Mekong Delta region encompasses a large portion of southwestern\
  \ Vietnam of over 40,500sqk, beginning in the Himalayas and makes its way through\
  \ Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, before finishing in Vietnam. With the region dating\
  \ back to 500BC and hosting a diverse range of biological species, it is considered\
  \ the Gem of the South. It also holds one of the biggest floating markets in VIetnam!\
  \ By no means did we plan on conquering the whole river, but a few islands in the\
  \ middle would give a great example of local vietnam life and show of true culture.\n\
  \nA few hours before noon, we began our journey with a round of fresh ground VIetnamese\
  \ coffee, a true delight of mine about Vietnam. A coffee a day keeps the hanger\
  \ away! Our first stop would be the Futa Express bus in DIstrict 10 of Saigon. Iain\
  \ from England, Marius from Germany and Nicole from Colombian were my trust comparades\
  \ for this excursion. Crammed in a minivan with a few locals, we begin a 3-hour\
  \ bus ride to our first port town, Can Tho. Every small VIetnamese province has\
  \ its own unique charm, almost an energy you can sense. Once arrived, we spot a\
  \ \u201Cb\xE1nh bao chay\u201D or vegetarian dumpling, I\u2019m immediately drawn\
  \ into the city. Despite being a pretty famous snack, it\u2019s hard to find vegetarian\
  \ dumplings in the big city of Ho Chi Minh, or Saigon by known locals and hip tourist.\n\
  \nAs we finally reach the ferry, we are bombarded by tour guides offering us packages\
  \ for the day. We politely decline and continue to seek out the most local information\
  \ we could find on navigating the Mekong Delta. We are finally pointed in the direction\
  \ of a bridge we could hail a motorbike taxi across. As any traveller will tell\
  \ you, motorbike travel is essential in South East asia, where driving or riding!\
  \ It can also be fast and cost efficient in the dreaded Vietnam traffic. Face mask\
  \ anyone?  We decide to walk alone the tree covered banks of the Mekong before continuing\
  \ across to another island. 1000 coconut trees later, we happen to past a family\
  \ of local Vietnamese having a karaoke Tet celebration. Tet is the lunar celebration\
  \ or New Years of Vietnam. Most of the city shuts down and its probably the most\
  \ peaceful time in any big city.\n\nThe four of us were swifted into their home\
  \ and immediately offered cold beers and a spread of different foods to snack on.\
  \ From shrimp to giant oranges, we were especially grateful as famished travelers.\
  \ If you asked me at the beginning of this trip did I think I would be having a\
  \ beer and singing Vietnamese karaoke with some of the friendliest locals I've come\
  \ across my travels in Vietnam, I would\u2019ve been skeptical. But here I am, beer\
  \ in hand, whaling my lungs out trying to match the tonal words on the karaoke screen,\
  \ thoroughly enjoying being a foreigner in an unfamiliar country. 10 beers a piece\
  \ later, we find ourselves, with my eagerly volunteered assistance, being personally\
  \ rowed down a small stream of the river. Surrounded by a slew of palm trees and\
  \ different species of birds, this moment on the Mekong was one of the most relaxing\
  \ and magical moments in the craziness of Vietnam.\n\nWith the day minding down,\
  \ managing to get our last minute selfies of the beautiful sunset over the Mekong\
  \ River, we head to our bus and journey back to Saigon, reflecting of the memories\
  \ made and local connections that will always be treasured."
