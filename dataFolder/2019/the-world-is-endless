Text: "A leap into the unknown\nEvery one has asked themselves the quetion what are\
  \ we living for? People's personality differs from each other and the mismatch between\
  \ wishes seems normally. People around me including myself believe that we are living\
  \ for cognizing this world.\nMy exploring experience had started from a conscious\
  \ age. While my experiences, I have found out that it is impossible to fully cognize\
  \ this world without traveling. \nI have been still remembering my impression from\
  \ the mountains in the Burabay village, which was one of the first trips in my native\
  \ country. Despite the fact that I was only 4 years old girl, I had taken a promise\
  \ from myself that I would reach a peak of one of the highest mountains in the world.\
  \ After these wonderful views of the mountains, I hadn't expected that something\
  \ could be better than them until I saw the sea's endless. In Thailand, I joined\
  \ the club of people, who can't live a life without the sea. I am so happy that\
  \ fate favors my eager desires. This is because it gave me a chance to swim in the\
  \ sea at least once a year. After my first trip to Thailand, I had decided to take\
  \ swimming courses.\nIt was one of the best decision. The main problem to dive in\
  \ the sea by myself had disappeared. I am fully lost track of time, while I swim\
  \ in the sea. Sometimes, I don't even notice how I swim throw the floating barriers.\
  \ My mom has taught me to take a needle if I would have a convulsion. But she still\
  \ worries, when I swim too long or too far. In truth, I just feel better when I\
  \ don't hear someone's voices and see the bottom of the sea. It is so pacifically\
  \ to swim alone. I also love to dive and look after the undersea world. These funny\
  \ small fishes, which are take away back and forth by the strong waves make me happy.\
  \ The strong waves are a separate story for me. I can say that waves are the best\
  \ attraction that I have ever tried. It is like a survival game, where you should\
  \ jump with the high waves or they would turn you on all 360 degrees or even more.\n\
  In my last trip with my family, I had visited Dubai. This city hadn't astonished\
  \ me only with its crystal sea, because I have found the place, which had taken\
  \ from me the third promise. The dessert had scared me with its infinity and amazed\
  \ with its perfectness. Every grain of sand was similar to one another. The promise\
  \ was to try to drive throw these holmes by myself. \nI am not telling my story\
  \ about a certain city or country. I just want to share with my feelings about our\
  \ nature that astonishing me every time with the same feelings like in the first\
  \ time. I have been only in 4 different countries for my entire life. But the feelings\
  \ that gave me these countries and cities, I will never forget. And these are the\
  \ main things that we are living for are happy memories\u2026"
