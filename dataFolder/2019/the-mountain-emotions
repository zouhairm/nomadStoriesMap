Text: "Ever since I have got to Himachal Pradesh (the mountain state of India), I\
  \ have been in this paradoxical situation where I want to write about everything\
  \ I see, but when I sit down to do it, I feel incapable to write about the beauty\
  \ of the mountains. No describing words feel good enough, no picture seems to capture\
  \ it, no collectible would be sufficient enough to bring these memories back.\n\n\
  Probably the only way I could preserve these memories is through the music it gives\
  \ me. Even the silence of the mountains has music in it.\n\nNow as I am sitting\
  \ in an extremely crowded bus which is hobbling around tiny roads within the Parvati\
  \ valley, I can\u2019t help but think of it as a scene out of a movie. There is\
  \ beautiful Hindi music in the background that seems to be moving in sync with all\
  \ of us in the bus. Everything is moving extremely slow \u2013 the music, the surroundings,\
  \ the bus and the time. The air is as fresh as it could ever be.\n\nMy emotional\
  \ state has been alternating between two extremes throughout this journey. As the\
  \ bus moves higher and higher, I can see the little cities at the bottom or on the\
  \ other side of the valley. A feeling of magnificance over takes me, I feel disconnected\
  \ from everything else related to my life. I had a life- a life in a city, with\
  \ home, a job, decisions to take, issues to solve. But today, that life is far far\
  \ away \u2013 right now, life is just me here, with the surroundings, with the bus\
  \ and the people in it. Nothing else matters.\n\nBut suddenly, the bus takes a turn\
  \ and I reach a little valley in between massive mountains. I feel insignificant.\
  \ How important is my existence amidst these massive mountains?\n\nJumping between\
  \ these emotions has been extremely exhausting but greatly satisfying. Think for\
  \ a little more than I should, and I am sure that I never would be able to go back\
  \ to the city and it\u2019s fast paced life."
