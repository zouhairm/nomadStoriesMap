Text: "I want to tell you about my first unexpected and unplanned solo trip to Paris.\
  \ \nSo, I was on my way to Southampton via Paris to join my husband on a cruise\
  \ ship that he worked for, I missed my connecting flight and was stranded in Paris\
  \ for 3 whole days as the ship was leaving that evening and would be returning in\
  \ 3 days. I had traveled to places on my own before but a family member was always\
  \ there to pick me up at the airport, but here I was all alone and totally clueless\
  \ as to what to do next. I was very scared and nervous.  \n\nI informed my folks\
  \ back home about the situation and they tried to console me and make me confident.\
  \ My mom motivated me to take this little mishap as a blessing and enjoy my alone\
  \ time in Paris for the next 3 days, she told me \u201Cyou\u2019re in the most happening\
  \ city in the world, be happy and have fun\"! Having been brought up with conservative\
  \ family values I was not very outgoing and really shy, forget about talking to\
  \ strangers. I spent the next hour self-motivating and preparing myself for the\
  \ next 3 days that I had to spend on my own in an unknown city. After I gained enough\
  \ confidence I started my unexpected solo trip to Paris.\n\nThe first thing I did\
  \ was approaching the airport officials and informing them about the situation,\
  \ they booked another flight for me to Southampton in 3 days and guided me to a\
  \ tourist information center to gain an insight into the city. \nThe tourist center\
  \ gave me all the important information that I needed to make my stay comfortable.\
  \ I bought a local traveling pass from them that would allow me to travel for free\
  \ in metros and buses, this was one of the best things that I bought because it\
  \ made my travel in the city very easy and convenient, another tip that they gave\
  \ me was to book a taxi to my hotel from them because otherwise I would end up paying\
  \ double the rate since private taxis from airport charge much more and indeed that\
  \ was true. By this time my husband had already booked a hotel for me in the city.\
  \ \nOne of my friends is an avid solo traveler, being inspired by her I always wanted\
  \ to do a solo trip however, I never found the courage, but look at Gods plan I\
  \ never knew I will be forced to take one! \nI recalled the tips my friend had given\
  \ me on solo traveling, first - not disclosing too much about yourself to strangers\
  \ and not making it too obvious that you know nothing about the city you\u2019re\
  \ staying in! I kept all these things in mind and brought out the actor in me ;).\
  \ I did not disclose too much to my taxi driver who kept on asking me as to why\
  \ I was traveling alone, I spontaneously made up a little story that I was here\
  \ on a business trip from my company, supposedly I was working with an IT company\
  \ as a software engineer.. ;) clever me!\nI reached my hotel and after checking\
  \ in and freshening up I started exploring the area near my hotel, I took some tips\
  \ from the receptionist at the hotel who was very friendly and helpful and gave\
  \ me information about how to go about exploring Paris and make the most of my 3\
  \ days here. \nThe next 2 days were spent in exploring the beautiful city of Paris.\
  \ The advantage of being on a solo trip was the fact that I could spend as much\
  \ time as I wanted in places that interested me. I spent half a day at the Louvre\
  \ Museum and one whole evening just gazing at the Eiffel tower. \n\nI ended up having\
  \ the time of my life on this unplanned solo trip to Paris. This trip not only gave\
  \ me a lot of confidence but also brought out a personality   that I didn\u2019\
  t know I had! I became more open, made new friends and learned how to enjoy my own\
  \ company. :)"
