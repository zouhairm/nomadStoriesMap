Text: "\u201CI\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s a little awkward,\u201D I tell the Moroccan\
  \ man behind the counter. \u201CI\u2019m missing something.\u201D\n\n\u201CA pair\
  \ of, uh, ladies\u2019 things.\u201D\n\nI\u2019ve returned to the laundry stall\
  \ in this far corner of the Marrakech medina, hoping to retrieve my lacy orange\
  \ underwear. (Make that, lacy orange *thong* underwear.) Prey to my preconceptions,\
  \ I'm expecting the worst: leering, indifference\u2014or maybe an extra fee.  \n\
  \nAs a new arrival and solo foreigner in this traditional Arabic neighborhood, I\
  \ make an easy mark for locals jaded by the tourist trade. After dark, the narrow\
  \ lane buzzes with boys and young men, shooting pool and smoking hashish, sparring,\
  \ eyeing the passersby. More than once, an enterprising teen has tried to sell his\
  \ services as an on-the-spot tour guide. The opening gambit: \u201CMadame, the path\
  \ is closed.\u201D Even when I know it\u2019s not.  \n\nRarely do couples appear\
  \ together here; they shop the medina\u2019s hamlouts (tiny convenience stores),\
  \ chicken butchers and vegetable stalls separately. Most women sport fuzzy, full-length\
  \ djellabas that completely hide whatever they\u2019re wearing underneath. \n\n\
  What will this young guy make of a red-headed American come in search of her lingerie?\
  \ To my relief, his eyes widen in surprise and concern. He rummages under the counter.\
  \ Above him, hanging from the ceiling, sober gray djellabas rub shoulders with flashily\
  \ embroidered caftans. Along one wall, a double-decker clothing press leaks steam\
  \ into the dim stall. \n\nBut the attendant is more eager to chat than he is to\
  \ search out my rogue underpants. I\u2019m equally curious about him. Standing just\
  \ inside the centuries-old medina wall, we use an app to bridge the gap between\
  \ English and Arabic. \n\nHe\u2019s from a place called Castle of the Song.\n\n\
  America is very beautiful and he\u2019d like to go there.\n\nHis name is Hamzah.\
  \ He\u2019s in his 20s, with close-cropped brown hair, an open face and a beaky\
  \ nose.\n\nWe\u2019re interrupted by the round-faced laundry owner, who arrives\
  \ carrying his toddler son. (There goes another of my mistaken notions about Moroccan\
  \ men.) The little boy totters around the stall, clutching a disc of flatbread in\
  \ both hands. I coo to him in English. He\u2019s nattily turned out in trousers\
  \ and a fleecy jacket with the word \u201Cworker\u201D stenciled on the breast pocket.\n\
  \nMaybe it's a hopeful portent of his future. Moroccans might think so. The youth\
  \ unemployment rate here stands at more than 25 percent. The minimum wage for private-sector\
  \ workers is a dismal US $265 per month. No wonder the teenagers in the lane habitually\
  \ try to hustle me for a few dirham. For them, the path really is closed: Work is\
  \ scarce, money is short and their access to Europe\u2014let alone the U.S.\u2014\
  is all but barred. \n\nBut the mood at the laundry stall is light, the conversation\
  \ easygoing. (In the days to come, I\u2019ll learn how much Moroccans love to joke\
  \ and shoot the breeze.) Eventually, I remind the guys about the missing underwear.\
  \ Hamzah ducks through a curtained doorway, behind which washing machines hum. He\
  \ returns with the prize in hand: damp, and somehow dirtier than when I dropped\
  \ them off. The orange fabric now has a greasy blue-gray smear. It must have gotten\
  \ caught in the cogs of a machine.\n\nI decide that damaged goods are a small price\
  \ to pay for the number of laughs I\u2019ve had this afternoon. \n\nBefore I can\
  \ stuff the panties in my pocket, Hamzah wraps them in brown tissue paper, which\
  \ he carefully tapes closed. Buoyed by the encounter, I stride home with my package,\
  \ smiling past the \u201CCrazy Boys\u201D graffiti that once seemed a little ominous.\
  \  \n\nI had dreaded going back to the laundry and considered skipping the trip\
  \ entirely. But now, each time I pass, I say, \u201CSalaam alaikum\u201D to Hamzah.\
  \ On cold evenings when business is slow, I stop to warm my hands on the worn black\
  \ cushions of the laundry press and talk more with this Moroccan man\u2014the first\
  \ to confound my many misconceptions. \n\nBy risking the return trip and allowing\
  \ myself to be vulnerable, I scored much more than a missing garment. I got to push\
  \ past my assumptions and connect with kind, good-humored neighbors where they really\
  \ live."
