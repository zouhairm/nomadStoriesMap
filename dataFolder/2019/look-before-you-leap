Text: "When I look at all the possible lessons that could be extracted from travel,\
  \ it\u2019s hard to pinpoint what\u2019s worth telling. Look before you leap. Walk\
  \ before you run. There are two side to every coin.  Life has a strange way of proving\
  \ all those proverbial phrases true, and this bitter sense of irony had just reared\
  \ its ugly head.\n\nThe piercing sound of a bone pop echoes over the cicadas, and\
  \ I know instantly; this is bad.  I had just leapt off the ledge of a Mayan ruin,\
  \ approximately 10 meters in height, and buried somewhere deep in the pits of the\
  \ Yucatan.  Below me was the jungle floor- an embedded labyrinth of vines and vegetation\
  \ that could either conceal soft dirt or the stiff remains of stone carved structures\
  \ dating back 2000 years.  I could only hope for a stable surface.\n \nIt\u2019\
  s easy to get carried away here.  I had spent the past week wrapped up in the myriad\
  \ of seemingly unexplored territories; the still un-excavated remains of the Mayan\
  \ empire.   I tried to imagine the inhabitants of these dwellings; the short, bulky\
  \ masterminds responsible for constructing such complexity using only raw materials\
  \ on the structurally challenging jungle terrain. \n \nI loved how untouched it\
  \ was.  How there were no ropes or guided paths.  The peninsula was like a giant\
  \ ancient playground.  You can touch, climb, sit, stand (and in my case jump off)\
  \ any of the 66,000 ruins, the majority still buried.  There is an infectious quality,\
  \ a feeling as if you\u2019re discovering it for the first time.  Soon I had rendered\
  \ myself Indiana Jones (but with a Lara Croft wardrobe) in my mind's eye, and this\
  \ unfortunate, overestimation of my abilities caused me to leap.  \n\nA sharp rush\
  \ of pain splinters up my leg, which now looks abnormally disjointed.  I try to\
  \ stand, but my knee wobbles and the pain sends me collapsing back down.  \n\nAn\
  \ old woman has noticed.  The day is dwindling and she\u2019s the only one left\
  \ at park.  She approaches and I sense an air of wisdom about her, a respect for\
  \ this forgotten territory.  The deep-seated wrinkles on her face suggest a specific\
  \ sort of knowledge that can only be learned through the passage of time.\n\nShe\
  \ pulls a jar from her handwoven bag and begins rubbing it on my knee. I realize\
  \ its an ointment as the fresh throbbing pain subsides to a cool, numbing tingle.\
  \  A quick exchange confirms what I suspected; we do not speak the same language\
  \ so instead, she offers a hand. \n\nThe sun has long since set by the time we reach\
  \ the only bus stop atop this lone hill, which feels so far away from civilization.\
  \  I\u2019m happy to have the company, even without words.\n\nShe catches me eyeing\
  \ a worn booklet she cradles in her lap.  Her eyes drift upward to nearby information\
  \ plaque.  \"Lies\" she says. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to realize the locals\
  \ have their own history.  She scoots closer and opens the book.  Inside is a maze;\
  \ a mess of scribbling, highlighted passages, make shift book marks, notes spilling\
  \ out into the borders.  She turns past illustrations depicting the cultural crusades\
  \ of the Spanish Inquisition, past the influx of Westerners in the 1970's, when\
  \ global interest in the ancients peaked.  Finally, she lands on a page with a large\
  \ photo of what looks like a Hindu deity, perhaps of Eastern influence but distinctly\
  \ not Mayan.  \u201CFound here,\u201D she tells me.\n  \nAnother page shows a sculpture\
  \ with undeniably Egyptian characteristics.   \"Here,\" she repeats.  \n \nMy knee\
  \ is swollen to the size of a balloon.   The mosquitoes are rampant, the heat is\
  \ dense and drinking water ran out a long time ago.  But as I listen, my imagination\
  \ spirals.  She believes the Mayans were a global society, and rejects the stories\
  \ propagated by Shelley and other Westerners, that highlight selective information\
  \ to tell a palatable and familiar narrative.  \n\nHistory is written by winners.\
  \  There\u2019s another one I forgot.  The lessons to be extracted still vary. \
  \ Should I have looked before I leaped? Or was meeting her and learning what she\
  \ shared the flip side of the token?"
