Text: "Travel\u2019s sacred allegiance to the promises of movement, change and departure\
  \ from our accustomed and habitual environment, with all its daily conventionalities,\
  \ in order to see and feel the world anew is a vital human experience that can enrich\
  \ all of us. I observed for the very first time the extent of the power of travel\
  \ through the cathartic release and personal liberation it offers during my week-long\
  \ sojourn in Barcelona. Simply moving through the Catalan capital, I felt intensely\
  \ the personal benefits that travel can afford for those who travel vigorously.\
  \ Through experiencing vividly Barcelona\u2019s distinctive and varied character\
  \ it truly felt like my spirit had been animated from a listless lethargy. \nMy\
  \ awakened state owes its origin essentially to the architectural diversity of this\
  \ great city, to the creative and diverse atmosphere that is always breathing through\
  \ it, where the old and the new are in constant communication as respective parts\
  \ of an organic whole. Coexisting in a state of continued identity are three separate\
  \ architectural spirits. Firstly, the Medieval Gothic, exemplified most exquisitely\
  \ by the arresting Cathedral of Barcelona, located within the appropriately named\
  \ zone of El Gotic, and thus adjoined to its characteristically rustic and narrow-cobbled\
  \ streets. Secondly, the complex network of Catalan modernistic expression, as diverse\
  \ in function as parks, such as the highly imaginatively designed Park G\xFCell,\
  \ which in its quirkiness and childishness takes one into the worlds of fairy-tales,\
  \ and hospitals, such as the eye-catching Hospital of San Pau. Finally, the legacy\
  \ of Classical architecture which projects itself triumphantly in the understated\
  \ grace of the Pla\xE7a de la Vila de Gr\xE0cia and in the commanding monument of\
  \ Columbus.\nOf the three architectural spirits, it was Barcelona\u2019s expression\
  \ of the modernist spirit, (which so enlivens the city and to which it deeply owes\
  \ its special character), which most captured my imagination during my stay in Barcelona.\
  \ The tantamount significance of Catalan modernism was such that Barcelona became\
  \ the centre of the modernist aesthetic movement in the late 19th through to the\
  \ early 20th century. Accordingly, Barcelona became the spiritual home of one of\
  \ modernism\u2019s most cherished icons: Gaudi; himself the undeniable symbol of\
  \ Barcelona. The event which most concretely established Barcelona as the capital\
  \ of Modernism was the 1888 Universal Exhibition held in Barcelona. The event was\
  \ comparable in its implications for the aesthetic precedence of the city as the\
  \ 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics has been for the surge in tourism. An impression\
  \ of this swelling a stroll down the pine-lined avenue of Las Ramblas can easily\
  \ indicate. Unfortunately, this surge has caused the most insidious blight over\
  \ this great city: the omnipresent threat of robbery.\n The greatest legacy of the\
  \ 1888 Universal Exhibition is undoubtedly the Parc de la Ciutadella, designed for\
  \ the occasion. The park represented the multifaceted excellence of Barcelona, for,\
  \ within the park, we find together existing in a sustained harmony: the Catalan\
  \ Parliament, Barcelona\u2019s Zoo, and the incomparable Arc de Triomf. The aesthetics\
  \ of the fountain of the park struck a chord within me the most acutely. Its classical\
  \ splendour flowed out from the harmoniously designed pavilion topped by four vigorous\
  \ mythical golden steeds. This magnificence is offset intriguingly by the surroundings\
  \ of tropical flora and fauna. The peaceful lake below and its centre-piece the\
  \ swelling fountain inspires serenity, doubly so in its reflection of the grand\
  \ scene above. The park filled me with a silent aesthetic attention and admiration\
  \ within whose grasp I was temporarily contained.\nOnly the Gothic Cathedral of\
  \ Barcelona was equally capable of holding my senses in such a suspense. Its mysterious\
  \ form contained an allure that left me gazing, unable to retreat from the enchanting\
  \ spirits that were being effused from the building. The surprising realisation\
  \ that it wasn\u2019t the Sagrada Familia that inspired me thus showed me the sacred\
  \ privacy of travelling. For, it is is a profoundly personal experience, the fruits\
  \ of which depend very much upon the psyche of each individual traveller.\nBarcelona\
  \ is forever emitting her unique dynamic and creative vapours, however it demands\
  \ the intense attention of a keen traveller to fully inhale them, and to return\
  \ home, as I did: intellectually stimulated, aesthetically nourished and spiritually\
  \ awakened."
