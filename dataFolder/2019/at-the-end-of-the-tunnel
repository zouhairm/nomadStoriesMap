Text: "My first-time trip alone was just to escape the blues of the IT industry. I\
  \ had won an argument with my inner, the more rational self that I can do this all\
  \ by myself. As the bus hit the highway and the breeze started to decloak me off\
  \ all my hesitations, it felt similar to when the wind caressed my hair as I first\
  \ learned to ride a bicycle. There was a similar smile on my face. I never thought\
  \ I would feel that way as a grown up. \n\nI reached Sirsi, Karnataka the next morning\
  \ and immediately fell in the soup. I didn\u2019t know the language, there was no\
  \ cellular network and hence no GPS and I couldn\u2019t find any mode of transport\
  \ to reach the homestay. Google had previously confirmed that my stay was at walking\
  \ distance from the bus stop. However, all I could see was tall, lush green trees\
  \ which spooked up the already eerie setup, one tea vendor who had a board that\
  \ said- \u201CBeware of black panthers\u201D (the only thing they cared to write\
  \ in English so that I could freak out more). \n\nAs I grew relentless, a man on\
  \ a motorcycle suddenly approached me and asked in broken Hindi if I were lost.\
  \ Now, the thing about India is that it\u2019s quite difficult to decipher a man\u2019\
  s motive when he approaches a girl, dressed in a not-so-orthodox attire, all alone\
  \ and clueless. But, I had no choice. I could either take a chance and ask him to\
  \ drop me or I could play host to a panther\u2019s hunger. \n\nI told him where\
  \ I had to go and he happily agreed to show me the way. I prayed to all the Gods\
  \ I have ever known of and got on his bike. He rode for about 2 minutes and then\
  \ entered the forest without saying anything. My heart raced as we entered the woods.\
  \ I stayed still until he finally stopped and asked me to get down and walk a few\
  \ yards. I thanked him before leaving and set off again. I had to tread the dark\
  \ and silent woods for hours in search of the homestay before the miracle happened.\
  \ I saw a hut with two mortals in front of it, whom I assumed were Mr. and Mrs.\
  \ Hegde, the owners of \u201CShantivana Homestay\u201D (Shantivana means \u2018\
  Peaceful Forest\u2019, I swear). I almost sprinted toward them. The lady turned\
  \ towards me and greeted me in Kannada which I did not understand at all. Her smile\
  \ though calmed me down a bit. I felt secured after almost a day. There was this\
  \ lone hut with no electricity and a surrounding so dark that I had no idea if there\
  \ were any more huts hidden around. Honestly, at this point, I couldn\u2019t care\
  \ less. I was hungry and sleepy. I got food soon enough and it was worth the wait.\
  \ Mrs. Hegde served one of the best meals I had ever tasted. Very basic yet extremely\
  \ delicious. I had a plethora of questions for the couple, but I had already spotted\
  \ the bed Mr. Hegde had laid out in one of the two rooms in the hut. \n\nThe following\
  \ morning I gasped as I stepped out of the hut. It was a huge farm amidst the forest,\
  \ where almost all the vegetables and staples I have ever had was being farmed.\
  \ The bright orange sky with the magnificent hues of the sunset painted a beautiful\
  \ picture, perfectly complimenting the greenery all around. My hosts joined me with\
  \ a steaming cup of masala chai and gave me a tour of the farm. \n\nI wanted to\
  \ stay back so bad, but I had to leave. I had planned to visit a few spots in the\
  \ vicinity before leaving for my next destination. I received the warmest goodbyes\
  \ as the elderly couple escorted me out of the woods and as I rode the bus again,\
  \ I had become a different person, more confident, braver and much more eager to\
  \ set off for an adventure very soon. What felt like a nightmare the previous day,\
  \ had become a beautiful memory for a lifetime."
