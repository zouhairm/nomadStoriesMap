Text: "IT'S famous as the birthplace of football icon Cristiano Ronaldo but Portugal's\
  \ Madeira Island has a lot more to offer than good looking, talented sport stars\
  \ or so I've come to appreciate.\nThe last time I visited was almost 20 years ago\
  \ and to say it's changed is an understatement. \nThis once untouched Portuguese\
  \ archipelago recently voted the Europe's Leading Island Destination in the World\
  \ Travel Awards, is the island of my ancestors and while holding a special place\
  \ in my heart, people all around the world are now discovering the gem that is the\
  \ pearl of the Atlantic. Visiting in July, summer is in full swing and the island\
  \ comes alive with festivals and tourists aplenty but despite it being peak season\
  \ don't let it scare you because as busy as it is, you can also find peace and tranquility\
  \ in abundance.\nThe island has something for everyone, whether it's adventure,\
  \ relaxation, romance, nightlife, gastronomy, history, culture or scenery - it's\
  \ all there wrapped up in the most picturesque package. \nStaying at Enotel Baia\
  \ in the beach side village of Ponta do Sol (sun point), this quaint hotel pool\
  \ and restaurant was the perfect spot to lay our weary heads. \nHaving not been\
  \ back for almost two decades, there was a lot of catching up to do and first on\
  \ the agenda was attending one of the many village festivals and for us the Madalena\
  \ do Mar's (Madeleine of the Sea) Banana Festival was first cab off the rank.\n\
  The beautiful seaside village known for its banana plantations celebrates them in\
  \ all their glory.\nWith two nights of partying until the wee hours of the morning\
  \ (think sunrise and breakfast on the beach) and concluding with some folklore dancing,\
  \ traditional music and the judging of the best pick (bananas) of the bunch - it's\
  \ a festival not to be missed.\nWhen it comes to gastronomy you can eat and drink\
  \ well for as little as six euro. \nTraditional must haves include grabbing a poncha\
  \ (distilled alcohol made from sugar cane juice mixed with honey, sugar, lemon rind\
  \ and different fruit juices) at Taberna da Poncha in the village of Serra de Agua\
  \ and trying a espetada with milho frito and bolo do caco (skewered beef pieces\
  \ served with fried polenta and flat bread) at Restaurante O Polar.\nOther foods\
  \ to try should also include lapas grelhadas (grilled limpets) at Bar Senhora Maria,\
  \ a picado (small pieces of meat served in a gravy with chips) at the Beer Garden,\
  \ arroz de marisco (seafood risotto) at Restaurante Preia Mar, a caldeira (seafood\
  \ stew) at Restaurante a Poita, tapas at The Old Pharmacy and sip cocktails as you\
  \ watch the sunset at Zion Project and Maktub.\nAs for what to see and do, the best\
  \ way to see the island is to hire a car or your own private driver so that you\
  \ don't miss a thing.\nStops should include the Gabo Girao - the world's second\
  \ highest sea cliff and Europe's highest, the natural pools of Porto Moniz and the\
  \ charming village of Santana where triangular thatched buildings were once homes\
  \ to locals.\nEnjoy the Atlantic and take a fishing charter or better yet hire a\
  \ boat, grab some locals, catch your own and enjoy a seafood lunch on the beach\
  \ - it doesn't get any fresher than that.\nFancy a game of soccer? Watch teams Maritimo\
  \ and Nacional playing in the Premier League at the Est\xE1dio da Madeira.\nWander\
  \ through the island's capital of Funchal and visit the Marina, Mercado do Lavradores\
  \ (fresh food markets) and Zona Velha (Old Zone) to see the coolest spot in the\
  \ city. \nArty and tightly packed streets, this once forgotten area has been transformed\
  \ into the city's nightlife epicentre with new and imaginative bars, restaurants\
  \ and hostels.\nWant to island hop than do it on the Lobo Marinho cruise ship and\
  \ visit neighbouring Porto Santo for crystal clear sandy beaches and sit back and\
  \ relax while watching the world go by.\nMadeira was claimed by Portuguese sailors\
  \ in 1419 and I understand why they stayed - if not for the hot footballers but\
  \ for everything else this beauty has to offer - it's a pearler."
