Text: "\"My friend, I have a plan to move to Spain. When are you exactly gonna come\
  \ here?\". Ila, my best friend since college said to me one day. After married she\
  \ move to Melbourne, then move again to Sydney. I realize I had been saving from\
  \ 2015 to go to Melbourne and Sydney. However, several times that money went to\
  \ another trip to Asia. Once I got off the phone and calculating my money, I bring\
  \ myself to see my boss to ask permission for vacation. I booked ticket to go to\
  \ Melbourne then later on continue my journey to Sydney. I had some research and\
  \ came across this book called Cheating East Coast Australia by Vicky Amin. I particularly\
  \ like the part when he mentioned that Melbourne is the most liveable city. I am\
  \ intrigue to see why. \n\nI get on the plane and cannot sleep thinking about all\
  \ the excitement that I am going to find. Once I arrived in Melbourne, 9:30 AM to\
  \ be exact, I sent text to my other friend, Pir. He was my senior camera person\
  \ back in the days when we still work at TransTV. He took me to coffee place called\
  \ Brunetti at Flinders Lane. His recommendation is caffe latte, so I choose that.\
  \ The marriage between espresso and milk, made it such perfect match from heaven.\
  \ While sipping it slowly, and catch up with Pir, I realize how laid back are peoples\
  \ around me. No one is in a hurry. Everyone just chill and have a good time with\
  \ their friends. Pir told me that when he started study for Phd at Victoria University,\
  \ he got scared. He was scared thinking how he could compete with other post graduate\
  \ students from all around the world. But his anxiety soon diminished once he absorb\
  \ the ambiance of this city, Melbourne, Victoria. \u201CMelbourne has its own way\
  \ to remind a person how beautiful life can be\u201D, he said. My thought said,\
  \ \u201CIf the rest of my Melbourne trip is as good as this coffee, I am a believer\u201D\
  .  \n   \nThe next day I went to Melbourne Museum. Since I read Vicky Amin\u2019\
  s book, I am dying to see this museum. I took picture of me and the big Melbourne\
  \ Museum sign with my tripod (must have for solo travellers) and smartphone. Once\
  \ I enter the building there is a gift shop that caught my eye. It is not because\
  \ of the interior design of the shop, but the goods in it. One of the canvas bag\
  \ that they sell is written \u201CSydney is not that great\u201D complete with the\
  \ magnificent Sydney Opera House printed on it. Apparently there are competition\
  \ between Melbourne and Sydney to become the best city in Australia. \n\nAfter finish\
  \ shopping, I took out my Myki card booklet and show it to the nice lady at the\
  \ ticketing counter (she even great me \u201CSelamat Pagi\u201D\u2026so nice of\
  \ her. Selamat Pagi means Good Morning in Bahasa Indonesia). By showing that booklet,\
  \ I got discount, so instead paying 15 AUD, I paid 12 AUD. The moment I step into\
  \ the area after ticket counter, giant Dinosaur skeleton great me. This museum gave\
  \ information about every object on display. I immediately took out my smartphone\
  \ and did what millennials nowadays do\u2026Instagram Stories time! (Yes, I am still\
  \ considered millennials\u2026lol). Visitors tend to look up, to see tall and gigantic\
  \ dinosaur skeletons. So once other visitor accidentally step on my foot, I can\u2019\
  t really get angry. \n\nThe other part of Melbourne that I visit are St.Kilda beach.\
  \ Once I step out from the tram, there it is\u2026the Luna Park greet me with its\
  \ smile. I decide not to play inside the theme park, because I want to catch sunset.\
  \ I walk down the beach and found the sun is almost gone. I quickly set up my tripod\
  \ and smartphone to capture me and the sunset. So many attempts to capture this\
  \ moment caught attention from a couple. The man said \"Good luck!\". The people\
  \ in Melbourne are genuinely nice. This is another reason why I love this city and\
  \ make me understand why Melbourne earn right to become the most liveable city."
