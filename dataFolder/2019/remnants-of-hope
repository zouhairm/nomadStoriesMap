Text: "A human skull was not what I had expected to find on my first trip to the Middle\
  \ East. Yet there I stood, covered in a sheen of sweat and henna-hued dust, delicately\
  \ cradling one in my hands. \L\L\n\nIn my mind, the Musandam Peninsula has always\
  \ possessed an aura of mystery. A tiny, remote corner of Oman surrounded by the\
  \ United Arab Emirates, its reputation for secrecy and fierce independence is mirrored\
  \ in the landscape. The barren coastline extends upward from the sea, dramatically\
  \ transforming into layers of mountains hidden behind mountains. An occasional scrubby\
  \ acacia tree provides the only relief from this vast expanse of sand and stone,\
  \ proving that the Al-Hajar (Rocky) Mountains have certainly earned their name.\
  \ \L\L\n\nWhile the city of Dibba is an easy drive from the bustle of Dubai, crossing\
  \ the border felt like stepping back into another era. A tiny town with wide, empty\
  \ streets, its most noticeable feature is perhaps its stillness; other than the\
  \ occasional call to prayer echoing off the surrounding hillsides, the loudest sound\
  \ is the distant hum of the power plant. \n\nEager to explore, my friends and I\
  \ set off on a hint of a trail towards a remote beach called Smuggler\u2019s Cove.\
  \ Winding uphill, the heat and humidity began to press down like a wet quilt. Beads\
  \ of sweat pooled at my hairline before slowly snaking down my forehead and back.\
  \ Goats dotting the cliffs around us scaled effortlessly up and down, and I attempted\
  \ to mimic their grace as I slipped and slid across the scree, trying to avoid twisting\
  \ an ankle. Climbing further still, we passed an abandoned stone village, and at\
  \ the summit were rewarded with sweeping views of the coastline. \L\L\n\nOn our\
  \ descent to the cove I began to notice bits of clothing along the path, frayed\
  \ and sun-bleached. Until recently, this was a well-traveled route for illegal immigration.\
  \ Drawn by the promise of work and a safe passage to Dubai, many handed their savings\
  \ over to smugglers. After traveling overland from various countries to Iran\u2019\
  s southern coast, they boarded a rickety boat to cross the Strait of Hormuz under\
  \ the cover of darkness. \L\L\n\nUpon arrival at the beach on which we now stood,\
  \ these immigrants would begin the same trek that we had just completed. Along the\
  \ way, old clothes were swapped for local garb. From Dibba, those who could afford\
  \ it were driven to Dubai, while the rest were forced to navigate the final stretch\
  \ of desert on foot. The tattered shirts and pants I had passed were their last\
  \ vestiges of home. \L\L\n\nDesperate for a break from the punishing sun, I settled\
  \ under a shady outcrop, waving the rest of the group onward to explore tidepools\
  \ and swim in the turquoise sea. While resting I noticed a distinctive rock set\
  \ back into the deeper shade. Moving closer, I was shocked to see a human skull\
  \ gazing back at me, white and weathered. Unnerved, I stared, rooted in place. Eventually,\
  \ I gingerly picked it up and walked down to the shore. \L\L\n\nI called the others\
  \ over, and together we studied the skull uneasily. We had hastily attributed the\
  \ scraps of clothing along the way to survivors, and had neglected to think about\
  \ those who had not finished the journey. Surely there were still family members\
  \ and friends holding out hope that they might one day hear from their loved ones\u2014\
  \ people like this individual who perhaps, like me, had sought refuge in a solitary\
  \ patch of shade. \L\L\n\nWe decided to leave the skull where I found it, and began\
  \ following the same route back. As I navigated the tricky path still thinking about\
  \ my discovery, a torn strip of red fabric underfoot jolted me out of my reverie.\
  \ I saw each piece of cloth anew, every discarded item as a rare, tangible expression\
  \ of hope. The former owners of these clothes bravely took a chance, leaving everything\
  \ behind for the dream of a better life. With each step, I hoped more and more that\
  \ they had found it."
