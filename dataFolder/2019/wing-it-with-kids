Text: "I\u2019d travelled a bit before kids. You know, the cheap booze-fuelled escapade\
  \ through Europe on a bus filled with smelly hungover twenty-somethings barely able\
  \ to recall last night\u2019s Octoberfest adventures - except for some vague memory\
  \ of a conversation with a bearded dude who had a gun in his jacket and claimed\
  \ he was with the Macedonia Mafia - and cringing at the very thought of the sunrise\
  \ trip to see and hear the famous glockenspiel bells...\nSo, when my husband and\
  \ I decided to embark on our first \u2018family\u2019 trip, with 10 and 12-year-old\
  \ princesses in tow, the whole process became a little overwhelming. All of a sudden,\
  \ things like safety, kidnapping, luggage limits and healthy eating came into play.\
  \ Could we just wing it (literally) with a pair of needy, self-obsessed pre-teens?\
  \ So, I started researching the \u2018safe\u2019 places to take kids, checking out\
  \ organised tours, kid friendly activities, motels with swimming pools, air-con\
  \ and so on.\nSix months later, I\u2019d planned everything to a tee. Where we would\
  \ eat every meal, located every swimming pool, pinned maps showing Australian embassies.\n\
  Bursting with anticipation, we landed in Hanoi and took a taxi into the city. The\
  \ kids were excited, as were my husband and I. Vietnam had always been on my bucket\
  \ list. We got out at our motel in the middle of the city\u2019s old quarter. I\
  \ had butterflies as we climbed out of the taxi. Straight away we were hit with\
  \ the incredible stench, compounded ten-fold by 40 plus degree heat and 99 per cent\
  \ humidity. I started to panic. I tried to smile. What had I done?\nThe kids moaned\
  \ and pinched their noses as we stepped over piles of rotting food and rubbish that\
  \ overflowed off the footpath and into the street. We entered the cool foyer of\
  \ the motel and were met by friendly staff wearing starched uniforms who handed\
  \ us each a cold glass of juice. Feeling refreshed, we made our way to our rooms.\
  \ My youngest flopped on the bed red-faced and fanning herself with a moth-eaten\
  \ brochure. I locked myself in the loo and cried. I thought about the next month\
  \ here and I just wanted to get on the next plane home. \nWe strolled outside into\
  \ the chaos and after about ten minutes we didn\u2019t even notice the smell. Dodging\
  \ the rubbish and insane traffic became a fun game. That evening we found a tiny\
  \ dessert bar hidden in a back alley. The food was amazing and the young locals\
  \ serving us were exceptionally friendly and keen to practice their English. I looked\
  \ at my kids. They were bright-eyed and grinning from ear to ear as they devoured\
  \ the mountain of shaved ice cream served in an enormous coconut. \nThis first night\
  \ was just the start of an incredible family adventure. We made friends from around\
  \ the world, visited schools for under privileged kids and met teenagers whose lives\
  \ had been changed thanks to Australian charities that had helped them get off the\
  \ streets and into hospitality. We ate food off the streets and were even invited\
  \ into people's homes for tea.\nEverywhere we were greeted with massive smiles,\
  \ particularly those of tiny, weathered ladies selling fans, fruit, even toilet\
  \ paper on the streets. The waves from the cutest little kids as they whizzed past\
  \ on the back of their mum\u2019s motor scooter, often with several siblings and\
  \ a pet sharing their ride. The vivid colours everywhere. From rows of gorgeous\
  \ candy coloured houses and shop fronts to fruit so bright it looked almost plastic.\
  \ And the rainbows of fabric, orchids and silk lanterns that lined the streets.\
  \  After cycling through rice paddies, cruising the Mekong during a tropical storm\
  \ and sleeping overnight in magical Halong Bay, we bid a sad farewell to Vietnam.\n\
  While it\u2019s not the carefree sojourn of my youth, travelling for me offers a\
  \ new thrill as I watch as my children are enthralled by the people, the flavours,\
  \ the sights and the sounds. To challenge themselves, to go out of their comfort\
  \ zone, to try new things and to become better people. Forget the theme parks get\
  \ the kids out there and see the real world."
