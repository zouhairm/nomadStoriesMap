Text: "What would you expect from a 4-hours change of buses in a city that you don't\
  \ know - carrying a 12kg backpack - in a rainy day? Probably nothing special. I\
  \ imagined just an ordinary evening sitting in a caf\xE9 waiting for leaving again.\n\
  \nOn that day I hadn't any internet connection on my phone, I didn't sleep enough\
  \ and I almost lost my first bus to get home on a rainy day. I was quite tired and\
  \ soaked. Starting from the beginning I lost myself in Nancy trying to find the\
  \ bus stop which was very far from the center; I took the wrong bus to reach my\
  \ destination and after several changes and several panic moments I finally found\
  \ it. I already was something similar a bottle of rainy water. \nI arrived at 4\
  \ p.m. at Strasbourg and I started diving into the streets which were more swimming\
  \ pools rather than streets as I knew it. I was almost the only person around. \n\
  \nWhat should I do? \"Walking around of course! The rainy doesn't matter. I will\
  \ survive.\" That\u2019s what I though. The reality was very different. I was cold\
  \ like a draft beer and my back was speaking to me saying it didn\u2019t have any\
  \ idea to walk around with a 12kg backpack. In a few minute I decided to find a\
  \ warm place and I went into a shopping mall looking for the hottest tea ever.\n\
  I took my hot drink and I started writing some feelings until the magic words appeared:\
  \ new city.\nThese two words changed my day. I was in a city that I didn't know,\
  \ that I've never though to visit and which really inspired me just seeing the millions\
  \ of bikes parked around.\nI changed my plan, and most importantly my socks, and\
  \ I started my 3-hours-trip-in-Strasbourg.\n\nThe matter was that I didn\u2019t\
  \ have so much time and any help from my phone. I forgot that and I started walking\
  \ into the smallest streets following the touristic indications that inspired me.\
  \ In a few minutes I found one of the most stunning cathedral I've ever seen. The\
  \ Strasbourg Cathedral, which is 142 meters tall and it's one of that building that\
  \ you can't stop staring at.\n\nExcited by this discovery I started walking, walking\
  \ and walking again around the city, losing myself in those wonderful and historical\
  \ streets and losing the perception of time. I was able to breath the air of Strasbourg\
  \ under the rain which is very dynamic and alive. The rain gave it a dramatic aspect\
  \ but it seems that the citizens weren't affected by it.\nI walked close the city's\
  \ canals and I felt myself very happy and alive, until the darkness come. In a moment\
  \ I lost my landmarks and my phone said to me that I didn\u2019t have so much time\
  \ to go back to the bus station. The panic came. I searched a map but I couldn't\
  \ found any of the streets I knew. The rainy, which until that time was really thin,\
  \ came back again to remember me I was already soaked but not enough.\n\nI stayed\
  \ 5 minutes without moving and then I started running as a man with 12kg backpack\
  \ could do. I tried to remember the streets but without the daylight everything\
  \ was more difficult. I walked around, I ran, I lost myself and then I found the\
  \ way, I lost myself again and I started running again. Finally I found the three\
  \ words that saved me: Parque de L'\xC9toile! The place of the bus station.\nWithout\
  \ any energy left I fortunately took my bus in time with a new city to add to my\
  \ list.\nI was so fascinated by that I can\u2019t wait to visit it again!\nStrasbourg,\
  \ see you soon!"
