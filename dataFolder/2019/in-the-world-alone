Text: "I had never allowed myself to be alone. The thought terrified me. Even though\
  \ I had always feared solitude, I liked my own company. An ecstatic rush swept over\
  \ my body being in the city alone. San Francisco exhilarated me like no other place\
  \ could. When I boarded the first metro train that came through the station, and\
  \ got off at a random stop after having my eyes closed the whole ride, I was shocked\
  \ with myself. There was something about this new me that was thrilling. For the\
  \ first time in my life, I was by myself, and I liked it. Karl, the infamous San\
  \ Francisco fog, was perched in the skies above the Cole Valley neighborhood.\n\n\
  \u201CNothing ever happens here. I wish we were literally anywhere else,\u201D cried\
  \ a teenage girl with short, blue hair who wore a black leather coat, tattered blue\
  \ jeans, and military boots to her friend whose clothes juxtaposed her own. The\
  \ two seemed to exist on opposite ends of the fashion spectrum; the militant and\
  \ the posh. The friend wore a cream colored knitted sweater layered over top a navy\
  \ blue Oxford shirt, khakis, and Blundstone boots, the official shoe of the Bay\
  \ Area. Their conversation fascinated me. San Francisco is the city where life happens,\
  \ where activism meets reality, where anyone can do anything they desire. These\
  \ two teens, however, found their hometown to be too banal, too predictable. The\
  \ city that gave the world counterculture, hippies, and the need to wear flowers\
  \ in one\u2019s hair was too easily placed inside of a box which had no need to\
  \ exist.\n\nThe two passed by me. Our eyes met for a moment. We looked through the\
  \ lenses of each other\u2019s glasses, into a stranger\u2019s eyes, and life moved\
  \ on. They entered a French caf\xE9 which stood on the ground level of a crimson\
  \ Victorian building with bay windows overlooking no bay, but rather the damp street\
  \ and the forlorn bodies which paraded themselves on by. That was the end of the\
  \ tale. I would be only a footnote in the story of their day; the weirdo who kept\
  \ eye contact for a moment too long, if they would even remember the event.\n\n\
  As they entered the caf\xE9, a group of French preschoolers caught my attention\
  \ down the way. They wore yellow raincoats and backpacks too big for their bodies.\
  \ Their school teacher guided them down the street. She was a tall, black-haired\
  \ woman whose beautiful curls exploded in every direction. The children joked as\
  \ American ones do too, albeit in French. They shooed away the pigeons, laughed\
  \ at nothing, and played between trash heaps. Everything they did was somehow better\
  \ than what other children did due to it being in French.\n\nI was quickly approaching\
  \ the schoolchildren. \u201CExcusez-moi,\u201D though I thought of myself as proficient\
  \ in the language, I still stumbled over the simple phrase. They looked up at me\
  \ with astonishment filling their eyes. Someone, whom they didn\u2019t know, could\
  \ understand their schoolyard talk, and could speak back in their language which\
  \ was distinct from the majority. Before they could truly react to my two words,\
  \ I was gone.\n\nEverywhere I looked around me, there were people. I was just another\
  \ face in the crowd. I found myself at the metro stop waiting for a train to take\
  \ me back. I was alone, and I felt good. The people waiting with me were so unique,\
  \ so themselves, so San Francisco. The elderly woman who still dressed like it was\
  \ 1965, the girl who looked like someone I would\u2019ve met during my childhood\
  \ family trips to the South Side of Chicago, and the man who wore a tweed jacket\
  \ and carried a briefcase with papers peeking out the sides like a child scared\
  \ of getting caught. We all boarded the train single-file, and headed our separate\
  \ ways. I went back to the apartment which served as a temporary home. For the first\
  \ time in forever, I was happy being surrounded in the world alone."
