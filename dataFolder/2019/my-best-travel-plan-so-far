Text: "So, Kyrgyzstan wasn\u2019t part of the plan, if there was any plan to begin\
  \ with. I had just wanted to explore Uzbekistan further after my friends left because\
  \ I imagined crossing border alone as a girl in Central Asia would be stressful.\
  \ Duh! Fate had it that I met three Polish guys at the backpackers. That, was the\
  \ start of my adventure! JK raved about the amazing landscape in Kyrgyzstan, hooked\
  \ me up with his childhood friend, AJ who lives and works there, and assured that\
  \ I would be well taken care of. A quick check online confirmed that Singaporeans\
  \ do not need a visa. And voila! Now, I have a plan for next day!\n \nCrossing border\
  \ from Tashkent to Osh is supposedly a 6-hour drive but in Central Asia, that's\
  \ probably fake news. It was officially the roughest 14-hour solo adventure of my\
  \ life! I left the backpackers at 9am, following the direction to a local plaza\
  \ for shared taxis to the border. I got dropped off under a highway, full of cars\
  \ and locals and no traveller in sight. I approached a police for help and soon\
  \ enough, a Local offered to bring me to the right place. All these, with not a\
  \ word of English spoken and just a piece of paper with Dostyk (name of border)\
  \ written in Russian and Uzbek.\n \nWe arrived at a huge carpark, full of taxis\
  \ and drivers, shouting and haggling for customers for their long distance drive.\
  \ The Local found me a Driver shortly. I paid, thinking \"Great, I'm on my way!\"\
  . Two hours later\u2026 I was still sitting in the front seat with my backpack on\
  \ my lap under the sweltering heat, waiting for the Driver to fill his car with\
  \ three other passengers, in addition to the numerous parcels in the boot (their\
  \ unofficial postal service)!\n \nAfter dropping all the passengers and parcels\
  \ along the way, I thought I was finally heading to Dostyk. It was 8pm dark. I had\
  \ arranged to meet AJ at 4pm! At Andijan, a town near the border, I was asked to\
  \ get into another shared taxi with three other locals! When I said \"asked\", the\
  \ Driver simply shoved my bag into another car.\n \nBy the time I reached Dostyk,\
  \ it was 10pm. And of course, it wasn't your regular border! It was full of military\
  \ guys patrolling and hordes of locals waiting in front of the barbed wire fence\
  \ gate. I felt like a fleeing immigrant, exhausted and resigned to my fate, dragging\
  \ my feet across the dimly lit rubble. Being the only foreign traveller, I used\
  \ it to my advantage with my last ounce of sanity left. I waved my passport with\
  \ a weary smile at a military guy. He escorted me through the madness, both at Uzbek\
  \ and Kyrgyz border. Small win in life! It was 11pm when the chicken finally crossed\
  \ the road. AJ had already left... understandably. I got a local to help me call\
  \ him and finally ended my ordeal.\n \nHaving experienced all that, I have to say\
  \ the distress came from not speaking the local language. I did not feel unsafe\
  \ in a threatening way. My travel gut told me that the locals I interacted with\
  \ throughout the entire journey were not people with bad intentions. They were equally\
  \ exasperated for not being able to communicate. Fellow passengers were kind, trying\
  \ to assure me with a smile, attempting to chat with me in Uzbek, nodding their\
  \ head saying Dostyk, Dostyk when they saw me anxiously checking on my Google map.\
  \ The Driver was eager to show me the amazing landscape in his hometown during the\
  \ journey. That, is their way of life, chatting and laughing happily with strangers\
  \ in the shared taxi, not in a hurry, not worried about not knowing when they will\
  \ arrive at their destination. \n \nI could not be more thankful to have met good\
  \ people in my travels. AJ took great care of me in Kyrgyzstan like an old friend.\
  \ I\u2019m not saying this is always a good idea but sometimes, when you travel\
  \ without a plan and go with the flow, it surprises you with unexpected adventures\
  \ and friendships!"
