Text: "I made an impulsive decision to visit Mombasa, Kenya after an influence from\
  \ a friend, Winnie. We had spent most of our days looking for jobs and doing short\
  \ contracts to sustain ourselves as we hoped for stable jobs. Winnie was invited\
  \ by her suitor to visit him in Mombasa but she was uncomfortable to visit a suitor\
  \ she barely knew by herself, especially in a new place. Therefore, she asked that\
  \ I accompany her. The suitor sent us money for our bus fare. So we were off to\
  \ Mombasa the next day in the evening. We talked more about boys and the frustrations\
  \ they had brought in our lives. Winnie had no intentions of accepting her suitor.\
  \ It was a good feeling to go to Mombasa though, mainly because of the coconut,\
  \ the ocean, the spiced mangoes named 'achari' made by Swahili people, and the freedom\
  \ of wearing short provoking dresses and bikinis. Aside from the numerous emergency\
  \ breaks the driver kept taking, we had a successful journey. My heart was leaping\
  \ at every break the driver was taking, as if I was experiencing them for the first\
  \ time every time.  I have heard and seen stories of people dying in a bus because\
  \ of head on collision, loss of control, lose bus breaks, and many other unpleasant\
  \ situations the devil puts on the roads. Whenever I travel, I just can't stay away\
  \ from feeling the forces of these stories. \nWe arrived at 7.30am. We looked new,\
  \ judging from the way we looked around the city, the way we spoke, and our willingness\
  \ to pay ridiculous price for a short ride to the suitor\u2019s house. However,\
  \ this did not happen because we were thoroughly informed by a Good Samaritan. The\
  \ suitor picked us up by the stage and left his bed room for us. Apparently, one\
  \ cannot sleep without a ventilation fan in the room. I heard that Mombasa was hot\
  \ and thought that it was exaggerated. I came out of the bathroom and dressed up\
  \ while sweating profusely. We slept until around 12 noon. We made lunch, as Winnie\u2019\
  s suitor disagreed on preparing food for us because it was against his tradition.\
  \ He believes that ladies should cook and he could only cook if he were alone in\
  \ the house. I shook off the \u2018tradition\u2019 because I was more hungry than\
  \ angry at that. Besides, he called us for a nice treat. \nAfter lunch, we were\
  \ set off to Nyali Beach Hotel which I came to find out later that it was labeled\
  \ the elite\u2019s hotel. At Nyali, a wedding was proceeding. Most people were enjoying\
  \ themselves. Some at the spa, some at the beach looking good and taking photos,\
  \ some were being taught how to swim, some at the pub burning their liver away,\
  \ and others staring around like Winnie and I. We headed to the pub and took two\
  \ glasses of red wine, each one of us, before dinner. Winnie\u2019s suitor had a\
  \ different drink that I do not remember. \nWhat was interesting to me during the\
  \ trip was how I overcame my fear of swimming in a large mass of water because of\
  \ the horror movies I have watched about piranha and shark attacks. Luckily, I met\
  \ a friend at the beach who taught me floating skills and encouraged me of how fun\
  \ it is in the ocean. The ocean was clear, blue, salty, and irritating to the eyes.\
  \ What surprised me was the fact that people hardly got sick from drinking the ocean\
  \ water. Back at home, people often got sick from drinking water from boreholes\
  \ or random wells and dams. More surprisingly, the beach boys had a bad reputation.\
  \ Therefore, I was keen not to trust a stranger in the voluminous ocean. I heard\
  \ stories of beach boys pretending to help amateur female swimmers and later sexually\
  \ abusing them in the deeper waters. Some were left to drown while others were returned\
  \ to the beach after people had dispersed. Despite this, I gradually enjoyed the\
  \ feeling of a lot of water on my body as well as the sound of the waves which sometimes\
  \ brought the piranha stories back."
