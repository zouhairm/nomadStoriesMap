Text: "With my personality, I have always been eager to succeed and all the while,\
  \ not being particularly concerned about making mistakes. I guess you can say its\
  \ like diving into the deep end of a swimming pool and hoping you can swim. Just\
  \ go for it! There is an advantage to that, but on the downside, you can never know\
  \ how bad of a mistake you're about to make...until you make it! I have found quick\
  \ apologies are always in order. After my first couple of weeks in Italy, the locals\
  \ always asked me that one famous question, 'Hows your Italian?' My response - '\
  \ Well, I'm not sure. I open my mouth, sound comes out and I hope for the best.'\
  \ After some weeks I went into this housing agency to sign the contract for my apartment.\
  \ When we were all done with the paperwork I said, \" Ascolta, ti voglio pagare\
  \ adesso. Cosi\u0300 sei finito e non devo preoccupare.\" For whatever reason, I\
  \ was under the impression I was saying, 'Listen, I want to pay you now. In this\
  \ way, you are finished, (referring to the business deal we were about to make)\
  \ and I don't have to worry about paying you.\" Obviously, once I paid, my dealings\
  \ with this woman were finished. So as far as I was concerned I was putting the\
  \ correct words together to form my perfect Italian sentence. Or shall I say, all\
  \ but perfect Italian sentence. In my mind, all I had to do was translate word for\
  \ word into Italian. Simple, right? I quickly learnt that's not how language works.\
  \ When it comes to language, you translate, not just words in themselves, but thoughts\
  \ and ideas.\nDo you remember those good old school days when you just blurted out\
  \ the answer during class, Loud, Strong and Wrong? It was followed by that embarrassing\
  \ silence, which turned into everyone laughing at you. And there you were, your\
  \ mouth goes a bit dry and you start to sweat under your armpits. It seems like\
  \ this minute is the longest minute of your life. But make no mistake, your laughing\
  \ also, you have to laugh if you want to seem cool, calm and collected. But deep\
  \ down inside your praying, praying for the class to hurry up and end. That's right,\
  \ you know the feeling!\nSo here I am back in this housing agency with a room full\
  \ of people. When I said, ' Ascolta, to voglio pagare adesso. Cosi\u0300 sei finito\
  \ e non devo preoccupare'. Everyone stopped talking and all eyes were on me. It\
  \ was then, at that moment that I realised I had made a very BIG mistake. It would\
  \ have been so nice if I could have retracted that comment. Feeling under pressure\
  \ now, I gave a smile as I waited for a response. Within seconds my friend who was\
  \ with me says while laughing, ' No, you can't say that!' Come to find out that\
  \ in the Italian language when you say 'sei finito', it means your dead. In reality\
  \ what I told this woman was, ' Listen, I want to pay you now. In this way, your\
  \ dead and I don't have to worry about this anymore.' That statement was followed\
  \ by a quick and sincere apology. That was definitely one of my biggest laughs while\
  \ living in Italy. Those are some of the joys of learning another language.\nThere\
  \ is definitely a great deal of satisfaction that occurs when having learnt another\
  \ language. Taking that leap into the unknown I quickly grasped that learning a\
  \ language and using it in real life are two very different things. Using the language\
  \ as do the locals entails changing the pitch, pace, and power. Cutting some words\
  \ short while drawing out others. Using a language in real life means perfecting\
  \ those pauses. Ah...a pause can change the entire mood. And as the famous musician\
  \ Artur Schnabel said, \" The notes I handle no better than many pianists. But the\
  \ pauses between the notes ah, that is where the art resides.\"\nSomething I have\
  \ always enjoyed with regards to making mistakes is that when it's all said and\
  \ done I have a really good story to tell!"
