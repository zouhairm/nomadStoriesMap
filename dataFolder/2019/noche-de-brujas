Text: "Last fall, after separating from my wife, I moved to San Miguel de Allende\
  \ in the vast central highlands northwest of Mexico, planning to stay for a few\
  \ weeks, maybe a month while figuring out my next move. I rented a shabby second-floor\
  \ apartment with a fine view of the town\u2019s gothic church known as Parroquia.\
  \ Across the street was a taqueria, a used book store, and a dark little tienda\
  \ with an excellent assortment of local mezcal sold in repurposed soda bottles.\
  \ In short, I had everything I needed. Next door was a ruinous hotel called La Mansion\
  \ del Bosque. I was at the hotel bar having a beer one evening on noche de brujas,\
  \ which is what they call Halloween in San Miguel. Donna, the hotel\u2019s elderly\
  \ owner, was behind the bar wearing a green felt witch\u2019s hat decorated with\
  \ papier-m\xE2ch\xE9 chiles, onions, and tomatoes\u2014her pico de gallo witch\u2019\
  s hat, she called it, something she\u2019d concocted at a mad hatter\u2019s party\
  \ her tango class held that afternoon at Recrero Palace where Donna took dance lessons.\
  \ \nShe was quite pleased with herself because evidently her witch\u2019s hat had\
  \ won first prize. She told me this while slowly pouring herself a glass of cheap\
  \ red wine, her bony hand, covered in amber bracelets jangling against the glass.\
  \ The party had just started but she was already a little drunk. Donna liked to\
  \ spend her afternoons sitting in her shady courtyard beneath a lemon tree\u2014\
  the only one I\u2019ve ever seen in San Miguel\u2014drinking beer with ice out of\
  \ a teacup as a prelude to cocktail hour when she switched to red wine. The watery\
  \ beer, she said, eased her into it. It being cocktail hour. \nDonna was in her\
  \ late seventies. She came to San Miguel de Allende by bus from Memphis more than\
  \ 40 years ago, before anyone had heard of it she says, before it became \u201C\
  the Mexican Santa Fe\u201D as she says derisively. She took a bus by herself from\
  \ Memphis and opened the hotel after leaving her first husband. \nSomeone later\
  \ told me that Donna\u2019s first husband was bi-sexual and abusive. Evidently his\
  \ bi-sexuality wasn\u2019t the problem. She\u2019s been married two or three times\
  \ since. I could never keep track. \nDonna has a daughter, Gloria, who runs the\
  \ hotel\u2019s front desk in the mornings while Donna is still sleeping. I asked\
  \ Donna one time why she and Gloria fought so much. She waved a hand dismissively.\n\
  \u201CDamn girl looks just like her goddamn father,\u201D she said.\nThat would\
  \ be the second husband, Fernando. He was still around somewhere, though the stories\
  \ about him varied. Someone told me he was very ill. Someone else said he just pretended\
  \ to be ill, that he\u2019d been dying of one thing or another for fifteen years,\
  \ always coming back to Donna for money when he was broke so he could pay for some\
  \ \u201Cmiracle treatment\u201D in Mexico City. Everyone rolled their eyes when\
  \ they mentioned the \u201Cmiracle treatments\u201D in the same breath as Mexico\
  \ City. \nI didn\u2019t really know anyone at the party except Donna, but that\u2019\
  s always the way it is in San Miguel. People are always coming and going. There\
  \ are the ones who come for a week-long vacation and a month later are talking to\
  \ realtors about a second home, trying to decide whether they prefer the neighborhood\
  \ of Atascadero to Los Frailes. Some, like Donna, settle in and never go home. I\
  \ wondered if I would be one of those people. \nI finished my beer and went over\
  \ to say goodbye to Donna. She was arranging the main table in the dining room with\
  \ various alfe\xF1ique\u2014sheep, skulls, witches. It was quite festive looking.\
  \ \nOnce outside I realized it was still early and I didn\u2019t really want to\
  \ go home. So I walked up Aldama to the Jard\xEDn, passing little devils with blackened\
  \ faces and angelitos in communion gowns wearing chiffon wings. \u201CHjallo-queen!\u201D\
  \ they cried, running up and aggressively thrusting their hands at me, jostling\
  \ me from every side. Not trick-or-treat, like in the states. Just \u201CHjallo-queen!\u201D\
  \ But, devil or angel, I had nothing to give them."
