Text: "I forgot the pain that sat heavy on my chest from the loss of a long relationship.\
  \ I always seemed to love with every breath in my body and give all that I could,\
  \ though my love was rarely reciprocated. But Guatemala loved me back. It sang my\
  \ name through the foreign song of the birds, invited me to dance on the fertile\
  \ land with bare feet and closed eyes, and graced me with freedom that set me apart\
  \ from the gods only physically. \nMy sister and I had gotten off the airplane in\
  \ an unfamiliar land. The air was thicker, the loud buzz of conversation was faster\
  \ and more incomprehensible,  and smells of spiced food lingered. Stepping off the\
  \ plane I was carrying my luggage and a heavy feeling of uncertainty, because my\
  \ whole life I had aching wanderlust until I was there; finally off wandering, solely\
  \ relying on myself. We left from the harbor town of Panajachel to a little hostel\
  \ on Lake Atitlan right on the mountains, called La Iguana Perdida. \nThe ride there\
  \ was peaceful and the moisture in the air hugged my lungs. I was taking in the\
  \ tropical green covered mountains that surrounded the lake, as I noticed my sister\
  \ sitting across me completely taken in. Her eyes were shut to better indulge the\
  \ surrealness of this perfect scene; warm wind blew through her long blonde hair,\
  \ freshwater lightly sprayed her clean pale face, her arms perched on the side of\
  \ the boat, and the first genuine smile I had seen from her in a while, slightly\
  \ emerged on her face. \nAfter arriving, we found a hidden dock on the lake and\
  \ jumped in. The first transition from hot sweltering air to clean cold water stopped\
  \ my heart for a second, but as I plunged deeper my muscles relaxed, and I felt\
  \ acknowledged as a child of the earth safe in womb of this lake; the air welcomed\
  \ me back at the top and I breathed in the most refreshing and reassuring breath.\
  \ I could tell my sister felt the same way; we didn\u2019t have to verbalize it,\
  \ it was clear in the gleam of our eyes as we looked over at each other, both floating\
  \ to the rhythm of the waves under the beating sun. We ran off the dock jumping\
  \ into the water and climbing back up, over and over again, sometimes with grace,\
  \ sometimes with no effort at all, but we couldn\u2019t get enough of the revitalizing\
  \ Atitlan water.  \nMy sister and I started talking like we never had before; back\
  \ home we always found a reason to argue but surrounded by so much beauty we felt\
  \ obligated to just love; we put it all out on the table, time had no hold on us.\
  \ The loud rumble of the forest and coo of the exotic birds came to a hum and the\
  \ night led us back to the main lodge, where other noise picked up.  \nThere we\
  \ joined the antics of others playing games and enjoying the food, and there, I\
  \ would create some of the realest most genuine connections I\u2019ve known. My\
  \ sister and I met two young men by the names of Nim and Paul. We all got along\
  \ famously; we talked about the widest range of things and it felt like we had known\
  \ each other for years. The cool summer air invited us for late night talks over\
  \ cheap cigarettes under the stars, occasionally interrupted by the clucks of the\
  \ chicken that lived there. \nMy sister and Nim retreated to their rooms, but Paul\
  \ and I rose up the mountain just as the sun did. He told me there was a view I\
  \ could not miss. We chased each other up the mountain and as we reached the top,\
  \  tears welled up as we stood on top of the world looking at the peachy sky which\
  \ mirrored the lake, surrounded by evergreen islands. I was truly fulfilled for\
  \ the first time in my life and so humbled by the spirit of the land\u2019s endless\
  \ gift giving. In 3 years we are all due to meet up again and I will rejoice like\
  \ I never have."
