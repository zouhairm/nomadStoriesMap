Text: "In 2012 I spent the holidays in the prettiest city I\u2019ve ever known and\
  \ whom I\u2019ll get back over and over again, Porto, and with this travel story\
  \ I want to share with you a little about my experience in this magic city and I\u2019\
  m going to do it through the Portuguese food because is what I miss the most and\
  \ what surprised me in a positive way, well, to be honest, I miss everything about\
  \ this city but for the purpose of this text, I\u2019m going to talk about the food.\n\
  \nThe first portuguese dish I tried when I arrived at Porto was \u201CBacalhau com\
  \ natas\u201D, (codfish dish), in a little caf\xE9 near Senhora da Hora and let\
  \ me tell you, this trip couldn\u2019t begin in a better way, this is a dish that\
  \ you must try when visiting Porto, it has a creamy texture, you don't feel the\
  \ strong flavor that codfish has and you can find this dish in most cafes and restaurants.\n\
  \nContinuing with the fish subject here, if you love seafood, then a good plan is\
  \ to go to Matosinhos where you can find a lot of great restaurants that are dedicated\
  \ to this type of food, I\u2019ll recommend salmon, but at the end everything\u2019\
  s so good you can\u2019t go wrong with anything you order. After finishing your\
  \ meal, you can walk by the beach, watch the sunsets that are beautiful and enjoy\
  \ the breeze and peace of this place.\n\n\nThe next dish I want to talk about is\
  \ the one of the discord and it is the Francesinha, I\u2019m pretty sure most of\
  \ the people from Porto will recommend Bufete Fase as the place with the best Francesinhas\
  \ and I went there and I liked them, but I have to say that I loved the ones from\
  \ Caf\xE9 Luso, please don\u2019t show this text to any Portuguese because will\
  \ have a heart attack, but yes, I think my winners were the ones from Caf\xE9 Luso\
  \ and I\u2019m sure that this was the dish I ate most during my trip, to me the\
  \ francesinha, the French fries with the sauce of the francesinha and a super bock\
  \ are a match made in heaven and this, hands down, will be the first dish I will\
  \ eat in my next visit to Porto.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I went to Porto in the\
  \ Winter and is nuts season there, so if you\u2019re downtown, you can find in the\
  \ streets someone that sells roasted nuts that are delicious, so a night out program\
  \ is, sightseeing the city while eating these warm nuts, walk through Rua Santa\
  \ Catarina and enjoy the Christmas vibes.\n\nContinuing with the holiday subject,\
  \ the Christmas dinner in Porto is codfish (you can tell that because when you go\
  \ to a supermarket everything smells like fish), they cook it with potatoes and\
  \ cabbage, this is the main course of the night and I have to tell you that I didn\u2019\
  t care for it, It\u2019s okay but nothing special, but the sweets they make for\
  \ this holiday are out of this world, the rabanadas, sonhos, bolo rei, bolo rainha\
  \ with a glass of Port wine are also a match made in heaven and you must try them,\
  \ I know you\u2019ll not regret it.\n\nTo finish, I\u2019d like to share a little\
  \ advice with you, if you are from Colombia and you don\u2019t like coffee and a\
  \ Portuguese offers you coffee, accept it, don\u2019t tell them that you don\u2019\
  t like it because to them is like your committing the worst crime in the world so\
  \ take advantage of the situation and try something different, (the coffee the way\
  \ they drink it), and have a good conversation with them because they\u2019re the\
  \ nicest, kindest and the friendliest people I\u2019ve known.\n\nWell, I hope you\
  \ liked this little Portuguese gastronomy tour, I hope to be able to share with\
  \ you more dishes, stories and places to visit when I win the World Nomads Scholarship,\
  \ until next time"
