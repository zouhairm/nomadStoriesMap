Text: "As my friends and I made our way down the muddy mountain trail high above the\
  \ Basque city of Bilbao, Spain, we noticed small groups of working men in heavy\
  \ work coats buying coffee from a small shop. We hadn't eaten breakfast before beginning\
  \ our hike that morning, and the constant busyness of the establishment spoke to\
  \ its quality, so we stopped for a short rest. We selected an outside table because,\
  \ although the weather was blustery, the view of the city and the River Nervion\
  \ was wonderful. As we sat, a young worker asked us where we were from and if he\
  \ might sit with us. The four of us, two from the US, and two from Germany, were\
  \ happy to have more company. We were walking the northern Camino de Santiago, and\
  \ we loved trying to talk with locals since my Spanish was sufficient for communication\
  \ with most of the Basques we had spoken with. The young man stretched out in his\
  \ workman's heavy pants and boots and clasped his warm coffee in hands that were\
  \ hardened and sun-worn, waiting for us to begin a conversation. I asked about how\
  \ to pronounce some of the mysterious Basque words I had seen along the way, many\
  \ beginning with unusual combinations such as tx. The young man responded with enthusiasm,\
  \ laughing at us as we tried to reproduce words he pronounced for us. He taught\
  \ us the lovely word for a light rain, xirimiri, since it was sprinkling at that\
  \ moment. \n\u201CYou know,\u201D he said, \u201Cthat our language may be the oldest\
  \ language in Europe. It is like no other language that can be found. We are a special\
  \ people in many ways.\u201D He asked us what we thought of his country, and we\
  \ told him of our appreciation for the beauty, neatness, and safety of both the\
  \ villages and the countryside. We gushed about the people who seemed to appear\
  \ from nowhere with a quick \"not that way\" whenever we were about to take a wrong\
  \ turn. We told him we felt uniquely cared for in this lovely area of northern Spain.\
  \ \n\"Ah, yes,\" he said. \"That is because you are in Basque country. We have pride\
  \ in our towns, our countryside, our hard work, our healthy food, but the rest of\
  \ Spain does not have such pride. The rest of Spain wants to party without earning\
  \ that right. We want our own country, but they cannot let us go. They know that\
  \ we are the hardest workers. Spain needs us, but we do not need the Spaniards.\"\
  \ \nWe were silent a moment. We had all heard about the Basque desire for independence,\
  \ but as we listened to a young man with such pride in his language, his people,\
  \ and his heritage, we could feel the struggle around us in the peaceful place.\
  \ Never again would we read of a Basque demonstration, protest, or vote for independence\
  \ with indifference. Instead, we would see the face of this proud young man and\
  \ remember that what is right is sometimes far from obvious."
