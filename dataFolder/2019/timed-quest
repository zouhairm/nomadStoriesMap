Text: "I feel like there should have been some kind of warning from the tourism company.\
  \ But there was not. So, when I woke up in Huar\xE1z, I was confident in the end\
  \ of that day I would have seen one of the most beautiful landscapes of my life.\
  \ The main reason I decided to visit Huar\xE1z in the first place: Laguna 69 (I\u2019\
  m still wondering why they chose to name it after that number).\nThe preparation\
  \ for the tour was very simple. I put on my winter boots, my one and only pink winter\
  \ jacket and drunk some Coca tea along the way. Obviously, I knew it was a long\
  \ hike to get to the lagoon I had read something about it on the internet, but I\
  \ was mentally prepared for a little fatigue mixed with \u2018soroche\u2019 (which\
  \ is how they call altitude sickness in Spanish), or so I thought\u2026\nWhen our\
  \ Van parked outside of Huascar\xE1n national park, our tour guide gave us a few\
  \ instructions about the trekking to reach Laguna 69. However, I guess I was too\
  \ excited to pay attention. All I can remember is that everything was timed. We\
  \ had 3 and a half hours to get to Laguna 69, plus 2 hours to be back to the car.\
  \ Time was short, and we were in a hurry.\nOur group of 12 people began the trekking\
  \ together. I was with three girls I had met only a few days before the trip, two\
  \ Mexicans and one Brazilian. The guide was ahead, and he never seemed to stop or\
  \ look back at our group \u2013 you know, just to see if we were keeping up. So,\
  \ we just hiked, following his steps, without a chance to look around at the immense\
  \ valley, let alone take photos.\nMy breath began to grow heavy when we were still\
  \ on the flat part of the way. I was aware that was the easy part, \u2013 I was\
  \ currently 3900 meters above the sea level, and Laguna was 700 meters up me \u2013\
  \ and that scared me a little. Maybe \u2013 just maybe - I was not as prepared as\
  \ I thought. Being the last of our tourism group also did not help, there were elder\
  \ people way ahead of me, for God\u2019s Sake.\nAt some point, we were already climbing\
  \ Laguna\u2019s Mountain and I was lost from my Mexican friends. Actually, I was\
  \ lost from the entire group. Only I and Paula, my Brazilian colleague, had stayed\
  \ behind. I felt dizzy, the oxygen was scarce. My camera crashed, the lens scratched\
  \ and I could not care less. Staggering as I stepped on the rocks, I saw my fall\
  \ dozens of times. Death was right at my left side, and for a split of a second\
  \ I thought falling wouldn\u2019t be so bad, at least that nightmare would be over.\
  \ Frightened by that thought, I sat down for the last time during that climb. \u201C\
  I can\u2019t take it anymore\u201D, I said. I looked at Paula, she was exhausted\
  \ herself. \u201CLet\u2019s go down\u201D, she said to my absolute joy.\nNo, we\
  \ were definitely not happy with our decision. We gave up. We were quitters. But\
  \ going down was so easy that we could do it while chatting about our lives. With\
  \ no pression upon me, when we reached the 3900 meters again I was light for the\
  \ first time that day.  It was still cloudy, but to my eyes everything was different,\
  \ like a high saturation photo. The slime on the rocks, the twisted tree trunks,\
  \ and the stream flowing through the valley. Huascar\xE1n national park by itself\
  \ was a masterpiece.\nI looked at my watch, and there was no need to rush. We still\
  \ had two hours to explore."
