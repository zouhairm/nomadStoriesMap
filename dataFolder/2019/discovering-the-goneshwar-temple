  \nThe Gondeshwar Temple was a pleasant discovery on our way back from a road trip\
  \ to Nashik.  Our Nashik road trip was coming to an end but I was still greedy for\
  \ more!  So I did some net searching to see if there was anything interesting along\
  \ the way back where we could make a quick stop.  After spending some time on the\
  \ net, I found some reviews of the Gondeshwar Temple.  It seemed like a lesser known\
  \ historical place, but all those who visited had been impressed by its architecture.\
  \  \n\nWe started early from Nashik to avoid the city traffic and by the time we\
  \ arrived in Sinnar it was just about the time for sunrise.  As we drove through\
  \ the town of Sinnar, it seemed like a sleepy town that was just about to wake up.\
  \  Most stores and businesses were still closed.  I followed along google maps trusting\
  \ that it would take me to the right place.  Soon we got off the main roads and\
  \ picked up a almost dirt road and the large temple complex was visible.  It was\
  \ almost strange to see this large temple complex in the middle of nowhere.  Nothing\
  \ in the area gave a hint of any historical connection.  As we drove up to the temple,\
  \ we found a few bikes and a couple of cars parked outside the gate.  I was already\
  \ impressed by the huge temple complex surrounded by a low wall and a beautifully\
  \ sculptured gate.\n\nThe Gondeshwar Temple was built by the Yadava rulers who had\
  \ ruled in the area from 834-1334 AD.  The temple was built using black stone and\
  \ lime that was available locally.  The layout of the temple is called \u2018Shaiva\
  \ Panchatayan\u2019 which means that there is a large central temple dedicated to\
  \ Lord Shiva and smaller temples on the sides dedicated to Vishnu, Surya (Sun),\
  \ Parvati, and Ganesh.\n\nAs I stepped in through the gate I was completely mesmerized\
  \ by the incredible beauty of the temple and the exquisite sculpture.  There were\
  \ indeed five temples on a raised platform.  The central temple was the largest\
  \ and dedicated to Lord Shiva.  Inside the temple there was the main altar with\
  \ a Shiva Linga.  The area in front of the altar was a small hall with beautifully\
  \ carved pillars and walls.  Right in front of the Shiva Temple was a tortoise and\
  \ a smaller covered area with a statue of Nandi.\n\nThere were four smaller identical\
  \ temples around the Shiva Temple.  Each of them was a smaller beautifully carved\
  \ stone structure with a small altar inside.  These temples were dedicated to Vishnu,\
  \ Surya (Sun), Parvati, and Ganesh.  Since we happened to reach the temple right\
  \ during sunrise, I was able to experience an incredible view of sunrise from the\
  \ Sun Temple.  Some locals had come to the temple early and they were practicing\
  \ yoga in front of the Sun temple.  Others had come to say their early morning prayers\
  \ and we saw a couple doing elaborate puja in the Ganesh Temple.  Since the temple\
  \ walls enclosed a large space, the temple grounds provided the local young men\
  \ ample space for a game of cricket.\n\nThroughout the temple complex and on the\
  \ temples we can see exquisite carving on the stone walls.  Even though there did\
  \ not seem to be any real temple maintenance in progress, the entire structure is\
  \ surprisingly well maintained.  The locals have also kept the entire complex very\
  \ clean.  Perhaps it is a good thing that this temple is not so well known among\
  \ the tourists and not many people visit it and leave their \u2018traces and footprints\u2019\
  .  There were no crowds or lines to enter the temple, no vendors trying to make\
  \ a business out of Gods, no priests hounding the tourists for money, and no temple\
  \ employees shooing away the devotees from inside the temple.  It was an incredibly\
  \ peaceful and spiritual atmosphere inside the temples.  We could spend as much\
  \ or as little time we wanted.  The locals had made this place a part of their daily\
  \ lives, their place for yoga, a game of cricket, or the morning prayers."
