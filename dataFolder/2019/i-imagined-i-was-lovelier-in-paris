Text: "As if in an attempt to materialize normalcy in a foreign country, I created\
  \ a ritual out of visiting the parks and gardens. Depending on the time of day,\
  \ or my mood, or if the weather threatened rain or unbearable sun, I went out beforehand\
  \ and bought chocolates, or drinks, or a makeshift dinner from the convenience store\
  \ that more often than not was just whatever fruit I could find.\n\nIt felt exactly\
  \ like I thought it would. I had a record playing on my phone for lovers by a band\
  \ aptly called Cigarettes After Sex, one of those that sounds hazy and slow, but\
  \ I thought of no one. Already warmed from the sun, every chocolate melted a bit\
  \ between my thumb and middle finger before I ate them. Every fruit was either too\
  \ sweet or not sweet enough, but had soft insides like a Monet. Children and dogs\
  \ and couples and grandparents were unaware of me but I was still there, taking\
  \ up space on the grass.\n\nIf the city had opened up, like a sinkhole would back\
  \ home in Florida, and the dirt gave way to a pit of whatever is underneath Brussels,\
  \ Paris, or Barcelona, my regret would not be that I spent the afternoon by myself\
  \ in the park eating and drinking. I don\u2019t think there would be a regret. Every\
  \ time I imagined this happening, I always thought of the dull realization that,\
  \ somehow because of me, there would always be a gaping bleakness in the green.\
  \ As if my solitary meal, with my phone playing music, and my worn clothes, and\
  \ my chocolates, would have marked the city forever.\n\nI didn\u2019t know how to\
  \ be interesting in Paris. I have a tendency to look at myself through the viewpoint\
  \ of others, or films, or music, or old text messages. I picked clothes that I thought\
  \ would make me blend in with the ya-ya girls in the city, who effortlessly leaned\
  \ against the wall in the metro while I worried about listening for my stop. In\
  \ \u201CCeline and Julie Go Boating\u201D, there\u2019s a scene where Dominique\
  \ Labourier is running up the stairs in pursuit of the tram Celine is taking up\
  \ to Sacre Coeur. She runs in her Parisian heels with her nose scrunched, making\
  \ faces and trying to hold her big bag and her book of magic steady. I didn\u2019\
  t take the tram and was sweaty by the time I reached the top.\n\nI wanted Rivette\
  \ to direct me all the way up, like an omniscient voice made of Paris\u2019 rooftop\
  \ buildings and cigarettes. It never came.\n\nEvery time I looked at my phone, I\
  \ thought that one of my friends would text me, tell me to meet them at the street\
  \ with all the bars. At the top of those stairs at Sacre Coeur, I wished they would\
  \ have, although I\u2019m unconvinced that the nighttime is different in different\
  \ cities. It\u2019s all the same twenty-somethings haunting the same streets, drinking\
  \ the same cocktails, making eyes at the same strangers. When I went back through\
  \ the pictures I took, I realized I didn\u2019t take pictures of the people I\u2019\
  d met at the hostel, but only of the doors of the bars we went to. I imagined them\
  \ all as places I had been before, all memories that I had somehow extrapolated\
  \ to be applicable to this city where I\u2019d never been.\n\nThe caf\xE9 where\
  \ Anna Karina was discovered is still on the same street corner. Busier of course,\
  \ filled with tourists who probably want to bask in what\u2019s left of its history\
  \ of intellectualism. I wanted to go inside, to pretend I was like Anna Karina;\
  \ a working knowledge of French, a mess of dark hair, and big eyes filled with promise.\
  \ \n\nBut I came right at the lunch rush, and instead I stood outside. I never got\
  \ a good look at the door."
