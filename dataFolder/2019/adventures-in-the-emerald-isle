Text: "Since I first traveled to Ireland, I fell in love with this island so enriching\
  \ in many ways. I lived about 8 months in the quiet and beautiful capital of Dublin,\
  \ studying English courses. Studying languages in this city is one of its main characteristics,\
  \ as people from all over the world come to study the English language in this country\
  \ and its schools in general are recognized throughout Europe. There are many points\
  \ to take into account of why I liked this small country, but with a great quality\
  \ of life. I could start with its people. \n\nIf you want to meet the most friendly,\
  \ warm and talkative people in the world, go to Ireland, that's what some friends\
  \ told me while I was planning my trip to Europe and then I said \"ok, why not\"\
  . I chose Ireland because I had been told very well about this country and its people\
  \ with their own interesting style. In addition to fun people, they are very respectful,\
  \ humble and trustworthy. I had the experience from the first day I got off the\
  \ plane and went to the city of Dublin to find my accommodation to get help from\
  \ people for every single thing, they did not even let me go until I really knew\
  \ that I was going to the right area or that I was just following the right directions.\n\
  \nThen we have the wonderful landscapes that brings the Irish and the rest of the\
  \ world to a getaway to the island. Besides being a country where the whole year\
  \ is green, there are places that will leave you with your mouth open. As I mentioned\
  \ it is a small country, but with many variations in nature, for example, you are\
  \ in the city of Dublin that is on the east coast of the territory and just 3 hours\
  \ away you can be at the other end of the COUNTRY! enjoying unparalleled views of\
  \ the Cliffs of Moher or seeing the cultural history that a few lost castles could\
  \ tell. It is totally spectacular. And if that were not enough, me as a Game of\
  \ Thrones series fanatic, in the north of the country you can find the places where\
  \ this TV show has been filmed, which is another reason why Ireland would never\
  \ disappoint me.\n\nPolitical stability and quality of life is something that you\
  \ can not leave behind in this country. In addition to having a minimum of inequality\
  \ in terms of race, gender and religious issues, living in Ireland will make life\
  \ easier for you in many ways. I had the experience of working for a few months\
  \ in a hotel in Dublin, and since I started with the processes to get a job until\
  \ I finished it during my time there, there was not a moment where I complained\
  \ or wanted to give up this opportunity. Besides the minimum wage is already high,\
  \ it has been increasing every so often and making people happy, so this is another\
  \ symbol of greatness for this country.\n\nOf course I will not pass over the fabulous\
  \ \"pubbing\" and the Guinness beer. This is like a letter of introduction since\
  \ the first day you arrive in Ireland. A visit to Ireland would not be complete\
  \ without experiencing the thousands of pubs you can find. Irish pubs are much more\
  \ than just places to drink a beer. They are a way of life, a way of sharing, laughing\
  \ and knowing. A must-experience for locals and visitors. Sl\xE1inte!\n\nAnd as\
  \ the phrase says, the best comes at the end, the music. This is what fascinated\
  \ me most about the island and for what I would be willing to return a thousand\
  \ times. In Ireland music is much more than a sound or an entertainment. It is a\
  \ fundamental element of their idiosyncrasy and, as such, from an old age it is\
  \ unique in society. In a few words, a meeting is not conceived without music. Enjoy\
  \ a show of traditional Irish music and a dance is the best way to understand the\
  \ attachment to music and understand that language so exclusive that expresses through\
  \ melodies and dance. Irreplaceable!"
