Text: "When going off to college, as a photographer, most people don\u2019t expect\
  \ you to find inspiration in the things around the college town you\u2019re in or\
  \ a less than scenic state.  As a photographer you have to go out and find that\
  \ inspiration, and that\u2019s what I did.  I created three separate projects based\
  \ off things in areas around my college town.  I researched trails, bridges, and\
  \ lakes man-made or natural. \n I started off with what was closest to me and that\
  \ turned out to be a railroad track. I got a couple of my friends to become my models\
  \ and had them had them pose organically.  During that same shot, we noticed an\
  \ abandoned building and decided that that would be a great place to shoot with\
  \ the sun going down. \n For my next project I researched about a haunted bridge\
  \ and found that there is a folklore about it.  I wanted to have a photo shoot on\
  \ here and near it during the day to showcase how night something could look terrifying\
  \ but in the daylight it is a very beautiful area to be around.  I showed that using\
  \ smoke grenades of different colours. \n For one of the last of my projects, I\
  \ went to a lake that was three hours away and photographed the trails, the people,\
  \ and the water.  I wanted that project to be about how you have to labour through\
  \ something and your  reaward will be an fantastic experience and a view.  Due to\
  \ the fact that my friend and I had to drive three hours to get to this lake, hike\
  \ down the hill that was filled with trails and strep rock formations just to get\
  \ to the scenic part of the lake. \n I find the category of my photography as a\
  \ whole is urban exploration.  My goal, once I graduate college, is to have a career\
  \ field where they inspire people to travel and explore their surroundings and not\
  \ just go to the typical tourist attractions or places they are used to. You could\
  \ find so many hidden gems if you go out with an agenda and let your feet guide\
  \ you."
