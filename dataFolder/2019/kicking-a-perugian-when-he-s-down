Text: "\u201CHe\u2019s late,\u201D Tony says. We stand outside our flat on Via Bartolo,\
  \ our breath giving canvas to the falling rain as it goes high and away. Moss comes\
  \ up through breaks in the casually laden stone and the whole street is on a slant,\
  \ beginning at the hilltop with a seedy d\xF6ner shop and Perugia\u2019s famed Piazza\
  \ Quattro Novembre. It\u2019s currently rife with white tents, idle conversation,\
  \ leather-bound ledgers, and roasted walnuts\u2014the Christmas market. We can smell\
  \ the walnuts from here. \n\nBefore long, headlights appear on the street\u2019\
  s low end, where sits the Etruscan Arch, an old city entrance dating back to the\
  \ third century BC. Jacopo pulls up, rolling down his window and grinning through\
  \ a lengthy, finely-trimmed beard. \u201CGimo alla Via del Cazzo?\u201D he asks,\
  \ an expletive that means something like, \u201COn our way to sh*t street?\u201D\
  \ We laugh and Tony shoots me a look, confirming the suspicion that neither of us\
  \ say aloud. Jacopo is drunk, or at least half-glazed. \u201CLet\u2019s go play\
  \ soccer, dai\u201D he says.\n\nJac (\u201CYock,\u201D to English speakers) is a\
  \ law student at the University of Perugia, one of the oldest universities in the\
  \ country. He\u2019s under strict pressure from his parents to graduate, leave the\
  \ city, and leave the country\u2014a narrative that seems to loop back repeatedly\
  \ for Italian collegiates. \u201CThere\u2019s nothing, here,\u201D he says, \u201C\
  in Italy. It\u2019s corrupt and the job market is failing. The best thing is to\
  \ work in England or Switzerland. Still, it\u2019s my home.\u201D I immediately\
  \ recall The Best of Youth, an Italian epic in which the main character is told\
  \ to leave Italy in the 60's by his professor. \u201CItaly is doomed,\u201D the\
  \ professor says, \u201CA beautiful, useless place\u2026 doomed to death. \u2026\
  Nothing changes here.\u201D \n\nWe speed away from the city center, past the street\
  \ vendors huddled together with Lucky Strikes on Corso Venucci. Out and down from\
  \ the city, we take the highway and arrive at a field surrounded by a tall metal\
  \ cage. An olive farm lines the back side. Our team is called \u201CAS Puli,\u201D\
  \ after the dog breed, and our insignia is a soccer ball and a smiling dog with\
  \ a mop-like coat\u2014another jest. We hear the whistle and climb into the cage,\
  \ the turf plush under our feet. Jacopo says a few winning words to the team, the\
  \ smell of grappa on his breath. A win would do some good, I think to myself. Maybe\
  \ it\u2019ll clot the bleeding. \n\nFor me, an Erasmus student painting frescoes\
  \ three days a week for school credit, Perugia is a fluffy tiramisu. I can take\
  \ a bite of it, this ancient municipality stitched on a hill overlooking the golden\
  \ plains of Tuscany. When I\u2019m satiated, I\u2019ll put my spoon down and push\
  \ my plate away. For Jac, Perugia is an Umbrian island\u2014his extra chromosome,\
  \ what both makes him and deters him\u2014a volatile union held at bay with fresh\
  \ banter and small-game soccer, among other things. The starters take the field\
  \ and the whistle goes.\n\nJac is quickly called for a foul. He pleads with the\
  \ ref, hands together, innocence on his face; a face naturally selected through\
  \ generations in response to a once-ripe land that has sat in the sun too long.\
  \ On the next play, Jac throws an elbow wildly, catching an the eye. Immediately,\
  \ the opposing keeper grabs him off his feet and throws him to the ground. He kicks\
  \ Jacopo in the temple, hard. The cage erupts as Jac\u2019s eyes roll back, he goes\
  \ limp as a rag doll, and both teams are off the bench screaming injustice and latent\
  \ violence, hands prepped to kill. Rain falls on the cage\u2014it\u2019s bedlam.\
  \ \n\nThe referees calm it down and end the game short. After a minute, Jac coughs\
  \ awake, sits up, and takes an ice pack to his head. He\u2019s already developing\
  \ rings under his eyes. \u201CThe game doesn\u2019t count,\u201D he says, cursing.\
  \ The pressure is released, but without satisfaction. The high ends and Jac sits\
  \ in the same limbo as before. He wipes his mouth on his shirt, bloodying the smiling\
  \ Puli dog on the team crest."
