Text: "Since I arrived in Bordeaux, I've been looking for something. I started looking\
  \ for other ways of studying besides the course I did, to improve my French quickly,\
  \ then I went looking for a job, after all I'm here for this. I also went in search\
  \ of friends, and the good thing about when you do an exchange is that this comes\
  \ as the days go by. But something that I searched for a lot during my season here,\
  \ was to know the city where I was living.\n\nDuring the days when you are living\
  \ in another country for a limited time, be it a month, six months or a year, I\
  \ believe you should try to get to know the city deeply. Go to the best known tourist\
  \ spots and take pictures, but also go in that neighborhood that no one has so much\
  \ interest to go, but there's someone who told you that it is very beautiful and\
  \ quiet.\n\_\nThe best for you to know the city as a place is to get lost. And that\
  \ said, I use a lot of google maps, exactly because I'm a lost person (seriously,\
  \ right and left, quoi?) And always had the feeling that I was late, I believe this\
  \ is because I was used to live in a busy city, with a normal life, full of commitments.\
  \ It was hard to put down the phone and really stop to look at the street where\
  \ it was walking, the details of the neighborhood, the people. Fortunately I can\
  \ say that I'm satisfied with the number of times I got lost in Chartrons, my favorite\
  \ neighborhood in Bordeaux.\n\nIf I love Paris because of the bistros and cafes,\
  \ I love Bordeaux because of the Pubs. It's really like coming back to Brighton,\
  \ another city that I loved and that even reminds me a little of Bordeaux, for specific\
  \ reasons like the way the streets are, the architecture, etc. At Chartrons it was\
  \ where I found the largest concentration of Pubs and gentle people, so I guess\
  \ that's what made me so fond of it. The neighborhood is very important and is part\
  \ of the history of the Wine and Commerce of Bordeaux, so you find parts of this\
  \ history by the museums in there.\n\n\_But in Bordeaux, as a medieval city, there's\
  \ always a place telling its history. At the Aquitaine Museum you will find a collection\
  \ with over 70,000 pieces from prehistory to the present day. The museum is wonderful\
  \ and you stay there for sure a few hours until you can see all the collections\
  \ and exhibits. No need to say that yes, I got lost in the museum.\n\_\nA place\
  \ where you can stay and spend all day is the Place de la Bourse / Miroir d'Eau.\
  \ Is it the most popular tourist spot in Bordeaux? Yes. Is it cliche? Yes. But I\
  \ do have something with the water. This place is next to the river Garone, in the\
  \ main Quai de Bordeaux. So sitting there next to the water, watching the time pass\
  \ by, looking at the River, was certainly one of my favorite things to do. At least\
  \ until November when you could stay in the streets without having to freeze in\
  \ the cold that is now!\n\_\nBut my season in Bordeaux has finally come to an end.\
  \ I tried to change my plans to adapt to the city, but I believe it was not my goal\
  \ to be here, everything was  leading me to leave. So I decided to follow the reason\
  \ why I'm in France now: Go to Paris!\nThe good thing about you taking a trip alone\
  \ is that it's you and your suitcases and let's go. Friends stay on the path and\
  \ in your heart and life goes on, but you must always go after what you believe\
  \ will complete you, make you happy.\n\nOne tip I leave is: Enjoy your own company.\
  \ It's what I've been doing these last few months and I've found that I really enjoy\
  \ doing things myself. Just listening to my thoughts and the sounds of where I'm\
  \ going is enough. I'm enough for me. :)"
