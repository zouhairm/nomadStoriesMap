Text: "Without preparing yourself for it, the heatwave consumes you as the steel doors\
  \ of the plane open. The essence of the salt that has filtered out of the sea is\
  \ felt in the air as you enter Cancun, purifying you. The airplane had landed in\
  \ the middle of the runway, and we were directed to the nearest gate entrance. As\
  \ you make your way across the airport, you miss to see anyone rushing. The tranquility\
  \ surrounding the luggage belt is unreal, the bodies were moving in a dead manner\
  \ as they waited for their belongings to make their way around the cycle. The present\
  \ state every soul was in would be unimaginable to anyone who has previously stood\
  \ in an overwhelming multitude as they tried to exit an airport. We recruited our\
  \ bags and directed ourselves towards the pick-up area. Another cloud of warmth\
  \ embraced us as the automatic doors allowed us through. Since our hotel had provided\
  \ the transportation, we stood waiting for any sign of familiarity that could come\
  \ from any of the chauffeurs standing outside their vehicles. That\u2019s when I\
  \ felt a sudden breeze touch my back, confusion struck my face as I reached underneath\
  \ my shirt and my hand had immediately been covered in sweat. A minute out in the\
  \ open and the back of my top had become imprinted with it. I made a note to myself\
  \ to never make the assumption about needing a pair of long sleeve shirts when coming\
  \ face to face with the kind of heat these locations possess.   \n\nThe first glance\
  \ will leave an impression. The highway could not have been a better prologue to\
  \ this journey, it was a glimpse at the main course. The palm trees stood in a row,\
  \ a never-ending line bowing to us as they whispered their welcome. We exited the\
  \ rural and entered the urban as we reached the hotel zone. The variation of vegetation\
  \ that stood alongside the road was introducing us to centuries of cultural background,\
  \ that hid beneath the country I was raised in. I had been brought to this specific\
  \ part of Mexico at the age of five and coming back still felt like discovering\
  \ the essence of my culture for the first time. The anticipation felt as we caught\
  \ sight of the ocean, in the open slots between the buildings, allowed us to visualize\
  \ the moment in which our clothes came off and our swimsuits became our second skin\
  \ for the entire week. The check-in went on apace, not a breath wasted in figuring\
  \ out our accommodations and not another breath went by as we sprinted to the beach.\
  \ Before our eyes, the manifestation of the view\u2019s simplicity lightened our\
  \ presence. The indescribable blue held by the waves was the reflection of the sky\
  \ itself, not a hint of disturbance and manipulated only by the gentle wind. It\
  \ would not be an exaggeration to say I was standing beholding paradise. You were\
  \ instantly wrapped around the tropical atmosphere, with their vibrant guitar, marimba,\
  \ and trumpet based music to Regional Mexican tunes. The staff found a balance between\
  \ their mother tongue and English to accommodate everyone\u2019s needs, and the\
  \ service could not have been any more satisfactory. In such a touristic environment,\
  \ you are given access to the rich aromas and foods the Mexican culture provides.\
  \ Allowing its guests\u2019 palate to be transported from the soft tamales, a dish\
  \ of meat wrapped in masa which is steamed inside plantain leaves, to the refreshing\
  \ horchata, a drink of rice water with cinnamon and vanilla. \n\nEvery so-called\
  \ insignificant element was brought together to create the savory journey we embarked\
  \ on in this seven-day trip to Cancun, Mexico, which was gifted to us by my grandfather\
  \ weeks before his passing. The experience takes you from the swims deep in the\
  \ salt water, to the aromatic dishes, to the simplicity of standing within these\
  \ tropical grounds and finding something you did not expect to find."
