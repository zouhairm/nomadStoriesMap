Text: "Hampi, one of the major historical and architectural tourist attraction in\
  \ India, preserved by the UNESCO, is considered as one of the important heritage\
  \ sites in India. The kingdom, once rich with glory and prosperity is now left with\
  \ the mourns of the people. The monuments and spaces yarns about the events that\
  \ took place back then. The Dravidian architecture, destroyed by the Islamic invasions\
  \ in late 13th century still holds itself strong enough to stand on it's own. The\
  \ temples here, not only brings us closer to ourselves in a spiritual way but also\
  \ tells us Hindu mythological stories sculpted on its pillars and walls. \nThe terrain\
  \ here has magnificent visuals. Granite boulders, being the major rock found here,\
  \ creates stunning balanced rock formations. \nHampi was a huge trade centre back\
  \ them and it is said that the market had sacks filled with gold as if it is rice.\
  \ This shows how rich the kingdom must have been. \nThe place was ruled by Hindu\
  \ Kings and Hinduism was followed by the people before the Islamic invasions. The\
  \ religion had a great impact on the architecture style here. The temples built\
  \ are mostly of Hindu deities. Some temples also have traces of Jain Teerthankaras.\
  \ \nPalaces and gardens were built for the royal members of the family. A huge elephant\
  \ stable was also built. \nPublic celebrations were a big part of this culture.\
  \ Huge grounds and spaces were designed for the same. Great provisions for flower\
  \ decorations are even seen now. \n\nHampi is a great place to explore south Indian\
  \ culture and it's history. Art and architecture here is also highly flourished.\
  \ If you are looking for a supreme, culturally rich and a different topography altogether\
  \ at one single place - Hampi is certainly the best idea!"
