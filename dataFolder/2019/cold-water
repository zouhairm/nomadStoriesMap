Text: "And there it was! Under the clouds and surrounded by sea, I caught sight of\
  \ the island from my window. My heart started beating so loud that I thought everyone\
  \ in the plane would realise. Embarrassed I turned around, but they were too excited\
  \ with the awaited arrival to notice me. \n\nThe freshness of the air that filled\
  \ up my dry lungs made me realize one thing: it was about time to be back. I missed\
  \ that country from the second I left it. It took me ten years to get the courage.\
  \ But finally, I was breathing in Iceland again. \n\nThis time the colourful houses\
  \ and the cheerful people of Reykjavik did not feel right. I did not come back to\
  \ find the joy of the first time. I was back to find myself and that couldn\u2019\
  t happen in the lively streets of the city. I needed to get lost in the vast nature\
  \ of Iceland. I had to see the green, feel the power of the water, smell the dark\
  \ sea, taste the loneliness, hear the sound of the ice breaking, get disorientated,\
  \ completely off-track, in the country where the nature was still more powerful\
  \ than humanity: the country of hope. \nI ought to feel the insignificancy of my\
  \ being and experience the loss. Although I was already lost, emotionally lost,\
  \ I wanted to be also physically lost. Maybe, if my body and my soul were in synchrony,\
  \ I would be able to breathe again without that unbearable pain.\n\nWe decided we\
  \ would go back. She made me promise it that day. We were under a thundering waterfall\
  \ and her voice sounded weak. But her hand in mine felt strong. Our eyes met. And\
  \ I promised. \nNow, I was finally back, barefoot, walking peacefully along the\
  \ black sand of Vik. I was back. But next to my footprints there was nothing, nobody\
  \ standing next to me. She was gone. \nMy mum had left me a year after that promise.\
  \ She felt sick when we went away from Iceland. I never kept the promise. \nThe\
  \ contact of the cold water with my feet made me shiver. Burning tears rolled down\
  \ my cheeks and returned to the salty sea. I opened my wet eyes to confirm that\
  \ I was alone. \n   \nI walked for a month on that island with fire and gas underneath\
  \ before feeling my blood warm again. Slowly, my pain became anger and I felt the\
  \ heat flowing through my veins like the lava flows through the rocks. Then, I felt\
  \ the urge to start running, so I ran. I ran for hours, I ran until I found a place\
  \ where I didn\u2019t expect to find any other living being, and then I ran no more.\
  \ \nExhausted, I fell down on the soft moss, under the never ending daylight. \n\
  I couldn\u2019t move. I closed my eyes and I fell asleep. I could not say for how\
  \ long. \nThe sound of hundreds of sheep bleating awoke me. I sat, very surprised,\
  \ a bit scared. Their peaceful way of eating while walking, unconcerned about my\
  \ presence there, calmed me down. \nBut the sheep were not alone. Behind them there\
  \ was a tall man, wearing an old coat and a hat. He was a shepherd and walked towards\
  \ me slowly, but confidently. \nHe sat next to me. Not too close, not too far, in\
  \ silence. And just like this, we waited for a long time, staring patiently at the\
  \ sheep, until they were filled with fresh grass. Then the man stood up, and just\
  \ before leaving, without any warning, he looked me in the eyes and with a deep\
  \ voice said: \u201CKemur Allt Me\xF0 Kalda Vatninu\u201D. Then, he left. \nHe left,\
  \ leaving me there, alone. But, for the first time in years I didn\u2019t feel lonely.\n\
  \ \nA few days later, flying away from that incredible island where nature is still\
  \ dominant, drops of rain blurred my view of the infinite ocean. And I was in peace.\
  \ Although I didn\u2019t know why, I knew that this time things would fall into\
  \ place. \n \n\n\nIcelanders say \u201CIt all comes with the cold water!\u201D (Kemur\
  \ Allt Me\xF0 Kalda Vatninu) meaning \u201CThings will fall into place\u201D."
