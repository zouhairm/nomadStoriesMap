Text: "Placing each dainty sneaker-wrapped foot by foot on little rocky outcrops in\
  \ the mud, arms swinging rhythmically by the sides of her vibrantly-coloured traditional\
  \ smock, Mau leads me up one of the many trailheads into the mysterious Sapa Valley\
  \ to her home in one of the villages, built conventionally by hand with help from\
  \ immediate family and relatives alike.\n\nKnown as the Tonkinese Alps due in part\
  \ to the colonialisation by the French from the mid-18th to early 19th century and\
  \ the other due to its picturesque peaks and cool climate comparable to the Alps,\
  \ Sapa Valley has in the 25 years since it was opened to foreign tourists bloomed\
  \ into a hotbed of both locals seeking nearby adventure and foreign tourists looking\
  \ for winter in the Eastern hemisphere.\n\nI am one such tourist.\n\nI first heard\
  \ of Sapa in 2012, but it wasn\u2019t until December of 2018 that I made it to the\
  \ there from Hanoi, rumoured to drop to zero degrees Celsius at the peak of winter,\
  \ in search of Christmas ambience in South East Asia. Chugging up in the little\
  \ shuttle through the misty groved road into Sapa Main Town, I was quite eager to\
  \ stretch my legs after the sleeper train from Hanoi to Lao Cai (the nearest railway\
  \ station) and leapt out of my slightly-too-cozy vehicle I had just spent the last\
  \ hour in with 9 other people, plunging into surprisingly brisk air - just 8 degrees\
  \ Celsius - at the tail-end of dawn.\n\nIt was while I was struggling like an overturned\
  \ turtle into my woollen overcoat when I met Mau. Amongst the sparse scatterings\
  \ of humanity in the town square, just awakening to the hustle and bustle of the\
  \ day, a quick head wrapped in the ethnic cloth of the Hmong (said to originate\
  \ from the Yellow River in China) popped up under my nose - quite a feat since I\
  \ stand only 157cm tall - followed in subsequent succession by a smooth, unlined\
  \ face and a pink-cheeked baby.\n\nSpeaking in slightly accented but very clearly\
  \ enunciated English accompanied by pearl-white flashes of a smile, Mau got straight\
  \ to the point and asked if I was looking for a homestay or guide; jiggling her\
  \ brightly-swaddled infant in her arms, she continued to chirp questions  at me\
  \ until I said gently but decisively that I would first like to fill my stomach\
  \ before thinking about any plans.\n\nI had taken down Mau\u2019s number before\
  \ hunting down a very French croissant and hot chocolate for breakfast in a cafe\
  \ nearby; hence, after scouring a few of the local and social enterprise tour agencies,\
  \ I decided to place my tourism dollars directly into her tanned hands and hired\
  \ the 22-year-old mother as both guide and homestay host.\n\nAs I pant warm little\
  \ puffs, the sun beat down, mocking my seemingly well-planned outfit with a temperature\
  \ hovering somewhere in the mid-twenties (my online research had to all intent and\
  \ purpose pointed at temperatures about 10 degrees C less), causing my HeatTech-wrapped\
  \ legs to feel like sausages about to burst from their nylon casing. With her limbs\
  \ encased in more organic cloth, tied off with twists of thread, Mau definitely\
  \ had reached higher enlightenment on layers - as well as climbing height - than\
  \ I had.\n\nAs part of her daily routine, Mau rises at 4.30AM in summer and at 6.30AM\
  \ in winter to carry out a full day\u2019s work of taking care of her 1.5-year-old\
  \ toddler, running the gamut of roles from sales & marketing, business development\
  \ and even operations in order to find and guide clients for her homestay programme,\
  \ run jointly with her sister-in-law. It wasn\u2019t until our first rest on the\
  \ trek when I snapped a candid photo of her looking pensively towards one of the\
  \ shrouded peaks that I realised she was also cradling her unborn second child.\n\
  \nMany would say the domestic life and filial service to her extended family reflected\
  \ a throwback to antiquated gender norms, but in her abiding joy and quiet grit\
  \ I find defined an unanticipated feminine strength that shone even out of a contemporary\
  \ context."
