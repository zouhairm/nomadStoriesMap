Text: "I can still feel the rush of excitement when I got a job in the UK after a\
  \ grueling interview process that lasted almost a month. Frankly, I wasn't excited\
  \ about the job as much as the opportunity to live and work in the UK. As a child,\
  \ I was fascinated by British pop icons. Many of them being gay icons like Sir Elton\
  \ John, most notably. Having being raised in a partially homophobic environment\
  \ where the laws of the country too did not support freedom of expression and the\
  \ spirit of inclusion, I used to get succour just thinking about countries like\
  \ the UK that allowed for all personalities to bloom and well, just have all the\
  \ goodness of diversity to live in absolute gay abundance. I remember crooning to\
  \ Elton John & RuPaul\u2019s Don\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart and secretly dancing\
  \ on the foot tapping music back in the days.\n\nMy first job took to the shores\
  \ of Singapore. Another Asian country, that too, is still stuck in the throes of\
  \ colonial past with regards to how its sexual minorities are largely seen \u2013\
  \ more a liability than an asset. But, Singapore taught me to be independent both\
  \ emotionally and financially. I made new friends, dived into the melting pot of\
  \ its culture, especially food and people from all walks of life. But I still felt\
  \ incomplete. Something bothered me and I could only put a finger at being pretentious\
  \ and putting up this fa\xE7ade in the midst of a heteronormative landscape. \n\n\
  Finally, after all the personal and professional highs and lows, I arrived at London,\
  \ continuing to see almost everything with this lens of exclusion and carrying many\
  \ labels: Indian, Gay, Effeminate, oriented to a Fixed Mindset etc. \n\nI was this\
  \ eager doggy who was just served a juicy bone. I was in the UK! And, for what it\u2019\
  s worth, nothing prepared me to experience life, gain perspective and expect to\
  \ find who I am as a person, as did living in London.\n\nWhat struck me just in\
  \ the first few weeks of my arrival was how diverse this city is. I had an instant\
  \ connection with the city and it's upbeat. I felt a sense of belonging and I attribute\
  \ that a lot to the fixed mindset I grew up with about the perceived life in the\
  \ UK. Fortunately, I wasn\u2019t wrong in that expectation. I quickly immersed into\
  \ the scene in London, be it being part of the cultural events, watching musicals\
  \ in the West End to letting my hair down in Soho parties, to savoring the art scene\
  \ at Tate, to taking long walks by the Thames + Southbank to traveling the length\
  \ and breadth of the idyllic English countryside. I joined forums, meetup groups\
  \ and met some engaging people. I have to thank my stars because in 4 years I lived\
  \ in London, I did not once feel I was lonely, sad or even discriminated upon because\
  \ of the labels I carried. I felt London is a great place to be single because of\
  \ the sheer magnitude of activities that the city\u2019s thriving scene bestows\
  \ upon everyone. The city built my personality. I was able to have a clear narrative\
  \ of the person I am and who I want be \u2013 Myself. I had the confidence to just\
  \ be myself in any circumstance. Pretention left me. I carried this mindset even\
  \ when I went back home to India and traveled to 16 countries thereafter. This profound\
  \ realization is ingrained in me now that no matter where you are, you can be yourself.\
  \ I don\u2019t believe in \u201CWhen in Rome, do as the Romans do\u201D. Instead,\
  \ when in Rome, just be you.. celebrate the differences because that\u2019s what\
  \ makes us unique and united. And, Unity is beautiful in all its glory. \n\n\u201C\
  Because you have no idea who you are until you experience yourself through different\
  \ people and realize how we are all the same\u201D\n\nI love reiterating quotes\
  \ that are so stimulating to the mind and senses, especially as they are rooted\
  \ in my real life experiences because I feel so motivated to explore the world we\
  \ inhabit.  \n\nTraveling is invigorating. I enjoy all the memories I create."
