Text: "Little was left to be the wild jungle. Rather, there was something left over,\
  \ that paved main road and still deserted at that time of dawn.\nWho would expect\
  \ to see two young women from northern Mexico with suitcase in hand, attire not\
  \ appropriate for the place and time (sandals and flowered dresses) walking through\
  \ that small town known for housing the area's drug traffickers, which consisted\
  \ of Only about a dozen adobe houses scattered on both sides of the road?\nSurely\
  \ not that motorcyclist, and still the fate (that\u2019s what I want to think),\
  \ put him before such an unimaginable scenario.\nWith all justification he asked\
  \ us for an explanation and it is this: my girlfriend and I were returning from\
  \ our day of rest in the cabins where we were doing a volunteer work that we decided\
  \ to do by living a new experience. We had decided to go to Tulum, which by bus\
  \ is about four hours from Mahahual, the beautiful and paradisiacal beach with reefs\
  \ in the Riviera Maya where the cabins where we were working are located. The road\
  \ was a delight: prehispanic pyramids and tropical trees skimming the roof of buses.\
  \ It was necessary to take two buses on the way: from Mahahual to Limones the first,\
  \ and from Limones to Tulum the second, each with a journey of approximately two\
  \ hours.\nOne does not think that spontaneity can play against you, but when you\
  \ arrive in a town (Limones) and they tell you that no more buses pass until the\
  \ next day you can feel that you should plan your day better. Then, there we were.\
  \ At 1am walking without money, without a cell signal on a practically empty road\
  \ almost 3000 kilometers from our home.\nFate did not leave us that hot night where\
  \ it seemed that everything else had left us. He personified himself in the form\
  \ of a motorcyclist who returned home in lemons from his work in a Mahahual hotel.\
  \ As we could we rode the 3 and two suitcases on that small motorcycle with 150\
  \ cc engine and toured the Mayan jungle for two hours under the moons and stars\
  \ to reach our cabins on the seashore.\n100 pesos was the whole show of gratitude\
  \ that he accepted and that we were able to give. I do not remember his name, but\
  \ I know he saved our lives that night."
