Text: "Lesson one from my first solo trip: Tinder is not a good place to find friends.\n\
  \nI was on my own--all the other exchange students had gone home for the holidays.\
  \ We\u2019d just finished our semester in Bordeaux, France. Rather than return to\
  \ the States before my second study abroad program in England, I\u2019d opted to\
  \ explore Strasbourg\u2019s famed Christmas markets.\n\nSince my time in France\
  \ was drawing to a close, I resolved to spend my trip practicing French conversation--which\
  \ meant finding francophone travel buddies.\n\nI was overzealous in my search for\
  \ friends. I posted on social media seeking mutual connections in Strasbourg--no\
  \ luck. I tried Couchsurfing travel buddy forums--one response, from a 50-something\
  \ German man. I politely turned him down.\n\nSo, I began entertaining unlikely solutions.\
  \ I needed a platform with a large, active audience my age in a specific geographical\
  \ location. Tinder was the perfect match.\n\nThe impending failure should've been\
  \ obvious. But after reading articles about meaningful friendships that had begun\
  \ on Tinder, I was hopeful. Hadn't some friends even made resonant connections on\
  \ the app?\n\nInstead of friends, I found stale conversations. Most people were\
  \ seeking romance or hookups (whoa, really?!). There was little interest in meeting\
  \ up with a random American looking for travel buddies. \n\nSo I started my first\
  \ day alone. I ended up meeting a trio of marines from Brittany, and we explored\
  \ the Christmas markets together. They invited me to join them for dinner, and insisted\
  \ on paying for the dishes we shared.\n\nEmboldened by our encounter, I attended\
  \ a Couchsurfing meetup the next night. One of the locals there messaged afterwards\
  \ and offered to take me around the city the following day. I eagerly responded,\
  \ and we arranged to meet up in the city square.\n\nThe day went without incident--we\
  \ explored the Palais Rohan (where Napol\xE9on Bonaparte once stayed), sipped tea\
  \ in a hipster vegan cafe, and snapped photos in La Petite France (the particularly\
  \ picturesque old town). \n\nBut then my linguistic ambitions seriously clouded\
  \ my judgment. \n\n\"You have to try this wine called Gew\xFCrztraminer--it's an\
  \ Alsatian specialty! Let's get some and have it at my place.\"\n\nI thought to\
  \ myself: wow, he must really want to be friends! After experiencing unbelievable\
  \ French hospitality, this innately-suggestive proposal somehow seemed less creepy.\
  \ After all, I'd shared wine and cheese with my Airbnb host the day before, and\
  \ my marine friends had been nothing but welcoming. Still, I felt uneasy as we walked\
  \ to his apartment. \n\nI brushed it away, deciding that he was simply ultra-friendly.\
  \ He'd been a patient tour guide all day, and I couldn't pass up the chance for\
  \ more French practice. \n\nBut my suspicions kept creeping. As we chatted, his\
  \ arm inched its way from the back of the couch to my back. He began drawing leisurely\
  \ circles with his hand. I scooted forward. His arm followed. I scooted sideways.\
  \ His arm was still there. Despite my clear discomfort, he tried to pull me closer,\
  \ leaning in for a kiss. I checked the time and abruptly announced that I had to\
  \ go.\n\n\u201CSorry, it\u2019s getting late and I have an early train tomorrow!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI whizzed out the door. It was 5 p.m.\n\nAs I waited for the tram in the slight\
  \ drizzle, I felt somewhat guilty. Had I inadvertently given the wrong message?\
  \ As I debated whether to apologize, and if so, how to word it (how do you say \"\
  lead you on\" in French?), he beat me to it. \n\n\"Didn't want to make you uncomfortable,\
  \ was really interesting talking to you! I didn't want to hit on you at first, but\
  \ you got me at the caf\xE9. Wish you'd spend the night with me :)\"\n\nMy slight\
  \ relief at the quasi-apology turned to horror. I'd seriously misread his intentions.\
  \ My attempt to make friends and speak French had landed me in some deep merde.\
  \ I *was* looking for friends, but not *that* kind of friend.\n\nWhen I recounted\
  \ the tale to a friend from home, he offered some sage advice:\n\n\"When you're\
  \ in England, don't go home with a guy who's offering this tea that 'you just gotta\
  \ try' even if you want to practice your English.\"\n\nDuly noted."
