Text: "Traveling to Nairobi,Kenya last year was a leap into the unknown. The flight\
  \ from  Nassau, The Bahamas to New York City to collect my youngest daughter, then\
  \ on to Turkey and finally Nairobi, Kenya is a trip that stands out most memorably\
  \ out of my thirty trips around the world. Why? This trip afforded us the opportunity\
  \ to have fun while contributing to a greater good of volunteering at The Children\
  \ of Mercy  Orphanage in Kahawa West which houses 33 children from ages 3 - 16.\
  \ The daily treks to the orphanage, from our host mother, Winnie\u2019s house, along\
  \ the crowded and dusty road, through the bustling market place to arrive at our\
  \ destination, then to be greeted by smiling faces and chores for the day gave us\
  \ a reason to be alive. From cleaning, mopping, washing, cooking and cleaning -\
  \ sometims there seemed to be no end to the work. Waiting for the older children\
  \ to return from school and serving them lunch we had prepared, in the dining room\
  \ we had scrubbed, was a gratifying experience. Then we helped them relax by playing\
  \ games inside and outside, drawing, dancing, and reading. So fulfilling!!\nVacations\
  \ in the past were characterized by fancy tours, drinks by the poolside, eating\
  \ non-stop, shopping until we dropped, and purchasing what the locals offered as\
  \ well as Mall trips. \nThis vacation was a leap into the unknown. We had to travel\
  \ light so the suitcases could fit under the bed with shared rooms of other volunteer\
  \ travelers, so I was not a fashion diva this trip. We had to save our money to\
  \ assist the slums and families and to purchase fruits and vegetables for the orphanage,\
  \ so there was no wild spending on things and souvenirs I would normally purchase,\
  \ and we had to live frugally to purchase water and supplies while there were constant\
  \ water cuts in the area. Quite a difference from former vacations albeit the most\
  \ rewarding.\nSilly me, I read nothing about Kenya. I ventured into the country\
  \ oblivious to rules and customs and thought that this time I would learn along\
  \ the way. I would be observant and I would enjoy the scenery  and establish relationships\
  \ and start conversations to learn what I needed to know. Silly me- it did not play\
  \ out like this at all. Had I any sense, I would have read about the country, I\
  \ would have learnt a little bit about the language, I would not have squandered\
  \ my money on frivolous things. I would not have left things to chance. Trying to\
  \ converse with most of the locals was useless as they could not understand a word\
  \ I said. Some were not friendly although we were told Kenyans are the friendliest\
  \ people in all Africa. The children made fun of us and called us \u201Cwhite\u201D\
  . Some of the women eyed us suspiciously as if they feared we would steal their\
  \ men and the men looked us up and down not appearing to be even slightly interested.\
  \ It was as if we didn\u2019t exist out there in the world.\nBut in the orphanage\
  \ we were loved and cherished. We were appreciated and respected. We were welcomed\
  \ with such excitement and genuine care that the feeling remains with me today.\
  \ Mama, Papa, Auntie and Jack and the children gave such unconditional love and\
  \ admiration that you could sail through life without food or water and bask in\
  \ the security of their simple lives, love and devotion.\n\nDespite the hard work\
  \ during the week, let\u2019s not forget the ride in the mountains, through the\
  \ safari countryside during our down time, the giraffe farm, the animal orphanage,\
  \ the zoo, the lake, the Monkeys, zebras, crocodile farm,  ostrich eggs, and the\
  \ overflowing of gorgeous flowers everywhere and the aromas coming from java houses,\
  \ and scrumptious flavors from native meals that made your mouth water before a\
  \ piece touched your lips-food for the Gods. The country is as developed as it is\
  \ underdeveloped. The haves and the have-nots live side by side, the poor and the\
  \ rich ride together, and the army marches to and fro saddled with heavy guns meant\
  \ to scare and kill. A wonderful experience!"
