Text: "I didn't speak French. But I wanted to. So at 18, I moved\u2014alone\u2014\
  from California to Angers, a medium-sized city in Western France, hugged tightly\
  \ by the region's storybook chateaus and white wine vineyards.\n \nAside from English,\
  \ basketball was the only other language I spoke fluently. I'd find a women's team\
  \ to join, I thought, and in doing so, make friends and learn the language. Not\
  \ the kind of French you get in a textbook, but the real, locker-room kind.\n\n\
  High-tops laced and pocket dictionary in hand, I set out on foot to the local gym.\
  \ Small, and seemingly stocked with fitness equipment from '80s infomercials, this\
  \ was not the modern California powerhouse facility I was accustomed to. Still,\
  \ I hoped they could point me in the direction of a court.\n\nThe gym's sole employee\
  \ was jogging on the treadmill, a scarf tied tightly around her neck. Her tiny dog\u2014\
  just as wiry as she\u2014yapped and nipped at her heels and as she ran. Upon seeing\
  \ me, she hopped off and used her fingers to work the sweat from her brow up into\
  \ the spikes of her boyish haircut.\n\nI wiped the sweat from my own palms into\
  \ the sides of my basketball shorts, and in French said, \"I ... would like ...\
  \ to play ... basket?\" So unsure of my words, I delivered my statement with the\
  \ intonation of a question.\n\nShe tore a piece of grid paper from her notebook,\
  \ wrote down an address, and sketched me a simple map. Even her penmanship looked\
  \ foreign\u2014nines that looked like \"g\"s, and \"o\"s and \"e\"s that fused together\
  \ (\u0153). Paper in hand, with an appreciative \"merci,\" I set off.\n\nThe course\
  \ she laid out took me far from the half-timbered houses and cobbled streets of\
  \ the city's medieval center. Now, I walked along billboard-lined two-lane highways,\
  \ juking Renault and Citro\xEBn cars through traffic circles, as if they were players\
  \ on a court. I was glad to be wearing my high-tops. All the while, I rehearsed\
  \ my line: \"I would like to play basket.\"\n\nThe map eventually led to a warehouse,\
  \ with a high, gated fence, manned by a seemingly impassible guard. Thinking I must\
  \ have taken a wrong turn, I tried my line, expecting to be redirected. Instead,\
  \ he opened the gate. \n\nCuriously, I walked toward the back of the warehouse,\
  \ and met another guard, who let me pass inside upon hearing my straightforward\
  \ request. Security could be tighter, I thought.\n\nOnce in the building, I heard\
  \ the familiar sounds of squeaky sneakers and bouncing balls, and eagerly walked\
  \ toward the noise, down the full length of a dimly lit, concrete tunnel. Perhaps\
  \ I wasn't as far off course as I'd thought. \n\nAbruptly, the tunnel spilled me\
  \ onto the hardwood floor of a professional basketball arena. Balls stopped bouncing.\
  \ Shoes stopped squeaking. And NBA-like giants from all over Europe stared down\
  \ at me. Unsurprisingly, their practice came to a halt when an 18-year-old American\
  \ women, suited up to play, walked onto their court.\n\nI said the only thing I\
  \ knew: \"I WOULD LIKE TO PLAY BASKET!\" \n\nI was met with laughs and confused\
  \ looks, but most importantly, with the contact information for a coach of a traveling\
  \ team of French women my age, with whom I played over the course of that year.\
  \ \n\nMy teammates welcomed me into their homes, especially on cr\xEApe nights.\
  \ They poked fun at my mispronunciations and laughed as they watch me slurp my first\
  \ raw oyster in the seaside market of Saint-Malo. The brave among them tried my\
  \ peanut butter sandwiches after practice, or asked about American politics. One\
  \ took me along to her grandparents\u2019 farm in Brittany for the weekend, another\
  \ to celebrate New Year\u2019s Eve in Paris with her cousins. \n\nBy the end of\
  \ the year, my jump shot was still much stronger than my French. But I left with\
  \ reasons\u2014more motivation than ever\u2014to keep up and improve my language\
  \ skills. Fifteen years later, most of my teammates have come, in turn, to California\
  \ to visit me, and we still correspond regularly."
