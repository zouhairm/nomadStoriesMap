Text: "\u201CPlease raise your right hand and repeat after me, \u201DMary Kate Lowndes,\
  \ Country Director for Peace Corps Eastern Caribbean said.\n\nWe raised our hands\
  \ and recited the oath of becoming a Peace Corps Volunteer.\n\nWhen all was said\
  \ and done, we were officially Peace Corps Volunteers and before I knew it I had\
  \ my island assignment to St. Vincent and the Grenadines for the next two years\
  \ to serve in a small fishing community. \n\nLocated on the Northeastern coast I\
  \ was headed to the Carib village of Owia, a sweaty yet scenic two-hour drive along\
  \ the eastern coast of St. Vincent from the capital city Kingstown. \n\nUpon arriving\
  \ at Owia I felt like a kid who had just run into a glass sliding door that was\
  \ open just a second ago. It was an awakening that I was isolated, living in a place\
  \ that was mostly untouched. \n\n Surrounded on one side by steep mountains and\
  \ by crashing waves on the other, I felt this sensation of being trapped in an unfamiliar\
  \ place. It was as if my gut was screaming, what are you doing here? \n\nAs I came\
  \ to this realization, I opened my eyes and looked out the window of my room. The\
  \ lavender sky was setting in, overrun by a burning orange, late evening light with\
  \ a fade of grey among the clouds. I looked at the colored rooftops speckled throughout\
  \ the mountainsides, as houses were tucked in sporadically along the ridges. \n\n\
  \u201CWanna go for a walk?\u201D my host sister, Nicoya, asked as I walked onto\
  \ the balcony of my homestay enwrapped in my thoughts. \n\n\u201CSure,\u201D I responded;\
  \ pleased to have the opportunity to get out of my own head and orient myself. \n\
  \nTogether we walked down the onto the main road and began heading up the hill toward\
  \ the mountains. We walked side-by-side along the edge of the road, falling into\
  \ single file whenever we heard a car barreling up the road behind us. We crossed\
  \ over a river, taking off our shoes and dipping our toes into knee-deep rushing\
  \ cold water due to the rains that came down earlier. Crickets started to chirp\
  \ increasingly louder as the sun set and the air finally began to feel cooler. \n\
  \nWe walked past locals who were sitting by the roadsides, sharing drinks and conversation\
  \ as Socca music played nearby. To the left, the hills continued to rise, but to\
  \ the right, the sun was subtle enough that it wasn\u2019t bothersome to the eye.\
  \ At that moment I took in the first sunset in my community, looking to the horizon\
  \ just above the water. There was a sense of simplicity at this moment that left\
  \ me awestruck. \n\nWe continued on to walk down towards the famous Owia Salt Pond\
  \ being joined by more kids who were intrigued to know who I was. Everyone waved\
  \ from their balconies as I walked down shouting \u201Cgood afternoon!\u201D. As\
  \ we reached the pond, standing 200 steps above it I could see the volcanic rock\
  \ formations that surrounded the pond and coral formations that added color to the\
  \ pond. We made our way across carefully taking each step on the sharp rocks. We\
  \ spent the rest of that evening floating in the water as locals came to join us.\
  \ Barefoot, they effortlessly dashed across the rocks, flipping and jumping into\
  \ the water. Then as we were treading in the water, a roaring sound of an incoming\
  \ wave grew louder and louder. Looking behind me, a large wave crashed through the\
  \ crevices and over the top of the rocks. Everyone dove wildly into the water as\
  \ the wave overcame them and pushed all of us across the pond in its current.\n\n\
  As we walked up the everlasting steps, trying to catch my breath Nicoya pulled on\
  \ my shirt and said \u201Cthey have something to ask you\u201D pointing at the group\
  \ of kids who had joined us for an evening swim. \n\n\u201CAre you going to be here\
  \ tomorrow?\u201D they said.\n\n\u201CYes, I\u2019ll be around here for awhile.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CI\u2019ll be around here for a while,\u201D I thought back to myself later\
  \ that night.\n\nIt began to feel good to say that."
