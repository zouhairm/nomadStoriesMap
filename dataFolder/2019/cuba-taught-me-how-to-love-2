Text: "It's almost dawn, I'm sitting at the last step of the Plaza America's stairs\
  \ in between two locals and while watching the streets of Varadero coming alive\
  \ with the light provided by the sky I feel like I never want to leave Cuba. How\
  \ did I get here? Well... Since the first day that I got here I was partying at\
  \ the street 62, the most famous street at Varadero where you're able to get cuban\
  \ live music all night and all day long. I was with my partner and we we're dancing\
  \ by the rhythm of Buenavista Social Club when I saw this couple of locals that\
  \ have their own bottle of Rum and where dancing in the middle of the street as\
  \ professionals so without even hesistating I got in the middle of the dancefloor\
  \ and started dancing with them, that's how we become friends and after dancing\
  \ for hours we headed to Melaito Caf\xE9 at 4:00 am to get a Tuna Sandwich and continue\
  \ our after party.\nOf course when they told me we were heading to an \"after party\"\
  \ I imagined getting to another night club as the ones that I'm used to in Mexico\
  \ City but instead we got into Plaza America's -literally and empty/closed mall-\
  \ where we sitted until the dawn. And diverse of what it might seem, it was amazing.\n\
  \nThe locals where telling us stories of how it is to leave under the Cuban regimen,\
  \ what they eat, how's education, how they see their future in the isle and one\
  \ of them even told us a story of how he fall in love with a Mexican girl and how\
  \ they communicate according to their time difference and the wifi he's able to\
  \ get by periods of time in Varadero, all of this while hearing cuban music that\
  \ a guy had on his cellphone. Everything seemed like a dream, I felt like a child\
  \ that was hearing a fairytale before sleep. I remember at some point we were talking\
  \ about love and how hard it is to actually experience true love in life, I understood\
  \ how different is their concept of it as people that are almost incomunicated to\
  \ the rest of the world and I also remember that all of them felt so connected to\
  \ eachother -something that I never get to see before as a millennial mexican that's\
  \ always on her phone- that made me thought to myself that that's what life is all\
  \ about: strong connections, stories, random places at dawn's, dancing through a\
  \ cellphone's music, laughing with someone that you might never see again. I guess\
  \ that night Cuba taught me how to love and suddenly I never felt so lucky as then."
