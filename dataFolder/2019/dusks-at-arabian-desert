Text: "Travelling to some underrated places always seams to be like opening the Pandora\
  \ box!! Saudi Arabia is one of the most underrated travelling destination in gulf.\
  \ I was quite fortunate to have opportunity to visit some places like Riyadh, Dammam,\
  \ Jeddah and Abha.\n Basically, more than 95% of Saudi is covered with desert and\
  \ the climate here is extremely unbearable. Summer season is not at all tourist\
  \ friendly as the temperature here climbs upon 50 degree Celsius in some places.\
  \ Winter is also cool. I've experienced zero degree Celsius here in Riyadh, the\
  \ capital of Saudi Arabia. If lucky enough, then you may experience some hail storms\
  \ as well in mid December.\n  I went to Saudi Arabia first time in 2016 for an official\
  \ project and have been staying in it's capital for last couple of years with the\
  \ same purpose. I've got the privilege to connect with the locals to get the social\
  \ essence of the place. Being an Islamic country, Saudi Arabia contains a number\
  \ of well decorated mosques. These are definitely proving the architectural elegance\
  \ of it's people. Dammam and Jeddah are two regions which contain beautiful seashore.\
  \ Most importantly, one must visit the place Abha. Temperature here use to quite\
  \ low throughout the year, because of it's height from sea level. Ample of valleys\
  \ enhance the beauty of this place.\n  Apart from the places to visit, the diversified\
  \ culture of people adds the place to a must watch list of the travellers. A time\
  \ was there when almost all the places were covered with barren lands and deserts.\
  \ People from Europe, subcontinent and some other places have started to come here\
  \ in quest for gold and then they discovered petroleum here. Since then, the demography\
  \ of gulf population took a new path. I spoke with people in a popular market in\
  \ Riyadh called batha. There I found people from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh,\
  \ Sri Lanka, Egypt and Philippines. I listened to them when there were sharing their\
  \ uphill journey here to set up their own business. They shared the stories of loss\
  \ and gain, shared the story of pain to stay out side of home country. But nothing\
  \ stood strong in front of them. It was an amazing feeling for a traveller (a stranger\
  \ almost) to get their story and having food under moonlit night.\n I think I shouldn't\
  \ conclude here, as I'm still exploring various shades of this country and it's\
  \ people. Hope to catch you soon in any other article. Till then, good bye."
