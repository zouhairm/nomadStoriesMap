Text: "I stood dumbfounded on the side of the road, too stupefied for the grip of\
  \ anger to take over.  Garbage lazily floated by, held adrift by a late afternoon\
  \ wind. A large hog in my peripheral appeared to be rifling through its dinner comprised\
  \ of rotting produce and litter. A group of locals talked at me in incomprehensible\
  \ Hindi, staring curiously. Thankfully, their intuition held them back from asking\
  \ for a selfie. I\u2019d have punched someone out if they did. \n\nA compromised\
  \ credit card had inhibited me from making online purchases, forcing me to buy a\
  \ bus ticket at a local storefront. This decision had led me to being stranded on\
  \ the side of the road after being told my ticket was no good and promptly escorted\
  \ off the bus.  I had been in the city of Jaipur, in the northern state of Rajasthan,\
  \ India, where I\u2019d been travelling for the last few weeks. I needed to get\
  \ to New Delhi so I could fly home to Canada. India had worn me out. I was ready\
  \ to go. \n\nAfter having travelled India for two months, I\u2019d arrogantly thought\
  \ I was now well versed in the scams the travel blogs warn you against - don\u2019\
  t buy milk for the begging mothers draping infants in your face to tear on your\
  \ heart strings; don\u2019t drink the water; don\u2019t eat street food; and certainly\
  \ don\u2019t buy a fake bus ticket from a local travel agency. \n\nDespite being\
  \ a well seasoned traveller - having been all over the world from the remote island\
  \ of Sulawesi in northern Indonesia to the vineyards of Chateau Rayas in Chateauneuf\
  \ du Pape - nothing could have prepared me for a country like India, what could\
  \ only be described as going back in time 50 years. \n\nNo matter how hard I tried\
  \ to settle into the chaos, inevitably another experience would shake me to my core,\
  \ forcing me to raise my guard once again. I\u2019d heard from so many friends what\
  \ a \u201Clife changing\u201D experience India was. This was a resounding thought\
  \ with each passing day, and I couldn\u2019t for the life of me figure out why anyone\
  \ would describe it in such a way. \n\nOne word that kept relentlessly coming to\
  \ mind was contradiction. Despite a love for bureaucracy - redundant processes in\
  \ obtaining documents or tickets obsessively checked by officials (once even after\
  \ getting off a flight) - the disorder perpetually reigned. \n\nThe sensory overload\
  \ was real and never ending. I imagined a virtual dial controlling all senses -\
  \ auditory, olfactory, visual - turned to max volume. Where putrid and nausea inducing\
  \ odours proliferated, an ancient temple would sit quietly and regally amidst the\
  \ pandemonium. \n\nThe scams were frustrating and anger inducing too. Initially,\
  \ the curiosity appeared charming.  Inevitably, it was a ploy to sell you something.\n\
  \nAnd then the sadness would hit, induced by heartbreaking scenes of poverty. Children\
  \ barely a year old, sitting filthy and shoeless in a gutter, working under the\
  \ tutelage of their elder siblings. The school of hard knocks training their next\
  \ street hustler. \n\nOver the course of those two months, I knew at some point\
  \ all of these contradictory feelings and thoughts would come full circle, making\
  \ clear what I didn\u2019t expect to find upon embarking on the trip. \n\nThe fake\
  \ bus ticket was meaningless compared to the hardship most Indians face on a daily\
  \ basis. A quick search to find an Uber escorted me to a boutique hotel. There,\
  \ I sipped beer on a beautiful rooftop barely an hour after I\u2019d been stranded\
  \ on the side of the road.\n\nIt\u2019s a funny thing, inherently knowing in situations\
  \ of discomfort, that those will be your defining moments. With the welcomed returned\
  \ to Western luxury, came an unexpected longing for the exoticism of India, memories\
  \ of situations I thought I\u2019d despised, that I would later fantasize of. \n\
  \nI\u2019d expected to have my eyes opened when visiting India - I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ it to change who I was."
