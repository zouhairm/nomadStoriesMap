  ------------------\n\nLet me start by asking you a question. Have you ever been\
  \ to a place that has charmed you with its serenity and beauty, so much that every\
  \ time you plan for your next trip, you can\u2019t help but go back to thinking\
  \ what a wonderful time you\u2019ve had during the previous one? I know every place\
  \ is different and beautiful in its own way (and please don\u2019t judge me) but\
  \ I think it has got to do with my expectations from the new place and challenging\
  \ it to surprise me pleasantly. You may call it a \u2018mini-comparison\u2019 that\
  \ I do in my head. Portugal has, in a way, done that (sweet) damage to my mind.\n\
  \nIn April 2017, I embarked on a sojourn to Portugal \u2013  the first European\
  \ city I was ever visiting. Portugal, until April 2016, was the last country I would\
  \ have imagined visiting for my first European vacation. The Mister was hell-bent\
  \ and keen on going to this southern European country but honestly, I had little\
  \ expectations from it. In fact, just before getting married, I had almost booked\
  \ my tickets for a Europe trip (including places like Prague, Vienna and Budapest)\
  \ with my girl gang. That\u2019s what I was looking forward to the most, compared\
  \ to Portugal.  Being the good wife I am, I gave in.\n\nMy thoughts started changing\
  \ slowly when the husband showed me a couple of pictures of places he desired to\
  \ visit with me when in Portugal. I then started my research. I kid you not \u2013\
  \ the number of blogs and vlogs I end up watching before going to a new place is\
  \ so many that I end up feeling I have already been to that place before. The results\
  \ of my online research (read intense) were impressive and I couldn\u2019t wait\
  \ for the vacation to start.\n\nAlthough the average employee wishes for a really\
  \ long time off from work, the reality is harsh \u2013 both of us managed to get\
  \ only 10 days.  Finally, the day arrived when I departed for LIS.\n\nAs the capital,\
  \ Lisbon is an obvious choice to start any Portugal itinerary. You could also book\
  \ your tickets to Porto, especially if you are coming from the Americas or elsewhere\
  \ but flying from Delhi, my option was limited to Lisbon.\n\nTwo words that perfectly\
  \ describe Lisbon: Vibrant & Sunny. This city will charm you the moment you arrive.\
  \ It\u2019s a no-brainer why it's frequently voted one of the most interesting cities\
  \ in the world.\n\nThe best way to explore this city, its history and culture is\
  \ on foot. If you like breaks from walking continuously, the iconic Tram 28 or Red\
  \ Hop on hop off buses could be your preferred ways of sightseeing. They take you\
  \ through popular tourist routes, including the Praca do Comercio (iconic square),\
  \ Arco da Rua Augusta (commemorative arch), Santa Justa elevator (a famous lift)\
  \ to name a few.\n\nLisbon\u2019s food scene offers you plenty of options to enjoy\
  \ some delicious meals. Our days started mostly with the usual Ham & Cheese Croissants,\
  \ fresh orange juice and coffee. Later during the day we mostly dug into seafood\
  \ wherever we went \u2013 be it crispy Calamares Fritos, Portuguese prawns, baked\
  \ fish and I even tried roasted octopus for the first time! Of course, all this\
  \ would have been incomplete without sips of, either Super  Bock (Portugal\u2019\
  s official beer) or Sagres or a glass of fruity Sangria. We concluded our meals\
  \ mostly with the famous custard Tarts or the Portuguese liqueur Ginjinha or simply\
  \ Ginja.\n\nOne of the most underrated and not-so-marketed countries, Portugal steals\
  \ your heart from the word go! Its picturesque cities, lovely coastline, diverse\
  \ landscapes & culture and incredible culinary scene have made it one of my favourites\
  \ destinations.\n\nIt made me realise how wonderfully a destination can take you\
  \ by surprise, even when you expect very little from it. In the end, it\u2019s all\
  \ about travelling with an open mind!\n\nBy the way, you still haven\u2019t answered\
  \ the question I asked you at the beginning of this post. :)"
