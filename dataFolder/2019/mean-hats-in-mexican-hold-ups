Text: "The first surprising thing about a Mexican holding cell is its colour. A dark\
  \ bottle green spans the entire length of the wall, and the rusty bars glimmer with\
  \ a nuanced tropical sheen, like a wet rainforest.\n\nWe\u2019d been in there for\
  \ like two hours. Maybe three. No one was wearing watches and the clocks were as\
  \ corrupt as the officers who pulled us in, showing three sets of different times.\
  \ Midnight was fast approaching and with it the new year, but for the moment it\
  \ looked like we\u2019d be saying \xA1feliz a\xF1o\_nuevo! tightly bunched together\
  \ with a few other rough looking unfortunates.\n\nThe second surprising thing about\
  \ our shitty situation was that it smelled like baked bread. No joke. Imagine the\
  \ homely, cosy and warm smell of croissants wafting in between piss, tobacco and\u2026\
  \ is that diesel? Who knows. \n\nWhy we got pulled in is a story for another day\
  \ and an extended tale about the drugs and off beat entrapments of Tulum\u2019s\
  \ finest. A Mexican tradition of deliberate deception, but I\u2019ll tell you when\
  \ you\u2019re older.\n\nAnd but so, here I am, with my four mates - we\u2019re about\
  \ to lose the plot. A pair of watchful eyes laugh at us from outside the cell as\
  \ we scramble around the concrete floor, tactically compiling an exit strategy.\n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019ve got, I dunno, like 650 maybe?\u201D\n\n\u201CYeah same.\u201D\n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019ve only got 300.\u201D\n\nWe all look at Percy like are you serious\
  \ man who only brings enough cash for like half a decent quesadilla on NYE. \n\n\
  Meanwhile, Anastasia, her brow furrowed and her skin gleaming with sweat, is silently\
  \ doing some maths in her head.\n\n\u201CGuys I have 15000.\u201D\n\nSeriously?\
  \ Are these people out of their minds? That\u2019s enough to buy a designer Chihuahua.\n\
  \n\u201CGive me half,\u201D I say to her as she rescues the wad from her sock. She\
  \ slides the whole thing across, \u201CJust do what you need to do.\u201D\n\nI slink\
  \ over to the oily bars. They look like vines adorning a criminal canopy of miscreants.\
  \ I can feel the burn from other inmates as they watch me, s l o w l y, all intrigue\
  \ and lust.\n\nI drop a swift whistle at the guard who\u2019s scratching the side\
  \ of his jaw with what looks like a very old peeling knife. Intimidation tactics\
  \ 101.\n\n\u201CIs there no other way to settle this?\u201D I ask with sincere innocence,\
  \ sliding the crumpled pesos into his breast pocket. My eyes water. For a moment\
  \ I think it worked! A flash of light in his dark brown eyes and then \u2013\n\n\
  \u201CQue\u2019so?!\u201D\n\nA barrage of lengthy, fast and foul mouthed Spanish\
  \ flows from his lips and he scuttles away.\n\nDrats.\n\nI\u2019m about to give\
  \ up but he comes back, this time with a plumper looking officer in a slightly different\
  \ hat. This one looks mean and worn down. The officer not the hat.\n\n\u201CQue\
  \ passa?\u201D\n\nI explain on my hands and my broken Spanish that we don\u2019\
  t want any trouble, we\u2019re just some kids from Australia trying to have a good\
  \ new years. Please, officer, we\u2019re harmless.\n\nThe Mean Hat throws me a look\
  \ dirtier than the moustache he\u2019s wearing and stares at the notes thrusted\
  \ upon him by Peeling Knife. His eyes are curious but they don\u2019t smile. He\
  \ moves his lips as he counts.\n\nTheir interactions are measured. Telling. Suddenly\
  \ I know exactly what to do. Mean Hat expects a little extra spice on his taco,\
  \ if you know what I mean. \u201CSe\xF1or, for your troubles.\u201D\n\nI fish out\
  \ the other half of the Chihuahua money. My heart pumps like a dryer with a stolen\
  \ wad of cash in it.\n\nA smile flashes, exposing missing teeth and 20 minutes later\
  \ we\u2019re out and gulping air like newborn babes. The rest of the night is a\
  \ blur - fireworks, tequila and knowing smiles, we dance into the early morning\
  \ with no cash but the sweet taste of freedom is all we need that night.\n\nOh and\
  \ the third surprising thing about Mexican holding cells? You\u2019ll have to find\
  \ out for yourself, but I\u2019d highly advise you learn how to say \u201Corange\
  \ elephant\u201D in Spanish if you want to survive the night."
