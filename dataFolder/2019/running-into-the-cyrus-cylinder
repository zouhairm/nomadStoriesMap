Text: "I had heard the name multiple times before. A majestic object that evokes imperial\
  \ grandeur and a glorious history for a nation struggling with modern crises and\
  \ yet proud of an ancient past: Cyrus Cylinder, commonly referred to as the first\
  \ charter of human rights. It was a childhood ambition to stand next to it and capture\
  \ the moment in a photo. And when I stumbled into Majek that cloudy evening, I could\
  \ hardly visualize the fulfilment of the dream.\n \nMajek and I were both on a British\
  \ government scholarship to do a master\u2019s in the UK. He was one of the most\
  \ composed, jovial, energetic and optimistic human beings I\u2019ve met my entire\
  \ life. Majek is Nigerian: a man discriminated against here and there for the color\
  \ of his skin \u2013 something he rarely talks about. \n\nIt was a Thursday evening\
  \ -- notorious for the fatigue of the lectures and credited for the freedom following\
  \ them. I found myself wandering around London, walking towards an unspecified destination.\
  \ It had turned into my leisure-time habit: concluding lectures and homework, taking\
  \ the first train from Chatham in Medway to one of the London terminals and submitting\
  \ myself to destiny, strolling across the capital to make new inferences and discoveries.\
  \ \n\nThe sky in London was pulling out all the stops to impress me with a show\
  \ of colors: pink, orange, navy, blue and gray. Moving past the restaurants and\
  \ bistros introduced me to a special hunger I hardly experienced when in Medway.\
  \ Temptation to stop by and have a small dinner at one of the minority food places\
  \ was irresistible. Arabs, especially the Palestinians and Lebanese do it perfectly:\
  \ when the clock strikes six and seven, the intoxicating smell of kebab and lamb\
  \ stews starts being emitted from these eateries and you simply want to go and order\
  \ something. That day, I resisted.\n\nMeeting Majek turned into that day\u2019s\
  \ mission. It had been a few weeks since we last met and I should have paid a visit\
  \ to the Nigerian comrade. Every reunion with him would reenergize and rekindle\
  \ me. He always had something to offer: a new book, a place to visit or at least\
  \ a cup of tea.\n\nIt was almost a long walk from Victoria to Bloomsbury: a promenade\
  \ I willingly embraced and categorically said no to boarding a train. \n\nIt was\
  \ 6:45 and I was a few blocks away from Majek\u2019s house. Struggling with my outdated\
  \ phone to show me the exact address on Google Maps consumed a few minutes. I was\
  \ almost there. And yes: even before ringing the bell, I could feel the warmth and\
  \ weight of a hand touching my shoulder from behind. Majek was there, in front of\
  \ the gate \u2013 he had just arrived from the school, and was signaling to me.\n\
  \nA congenial greeting and exchange of some words marked the beginning of the encounter.\
  \ And as always, he had something to offer: a visit to the British Museum just around\
  \ the corner, opposite of his house. \n\nI was privileged to be invited to such\
  \ a great visit. But I knew it would be time-consuming to browse the museum thoroughly\
  \ and I had only come to pay a visit to Majek himself, have a coffee or tea, have\
  \ dinner and leave. However, I don\u2019t know why I agreed.\n\nMy agreement was\
  \ followed by a set of steps: we crossed the street and entered the museum\u2019\
  s yard, adorned with trees and flowers that could hardly be distinguished in the\
  \ dark, took the stairs and found our way to the main hall. It was a mesmerizing\
  \ and luminous hall. Expectedly, there were guides to different sections of the\
  \ museum: different civilizations and historical periods. And yes, a dedicated section\
  \ for the Persian civilization was included in the museum. I was so excited that\
  \ I could barely keep my feet moving. I was shivering and nearly breaking into tears.\
  \ Majek told me that I was going to shortly run into an indispensable and integral\
  \ part of my national heritage and background. We found the doorway to the Persian\
  \ civilization section of the British Museum, and the first object on display was\
  \ the \u201CCyrus Cylinder.\u201D"
