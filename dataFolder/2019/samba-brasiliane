Text: "\"Samba, Brasiliane*! \"\n\nIt was a dreamed, planned, expected trip.\nAnd\
  \ its big day has finally come! Fourth of July!\nThere were four years of saving\
  \ money, researching, making itineraries and arrangements like rail pass, international\
  \ student card, youth hostel guide... And the coolest part was to start the trip\
  \ in Spain, more precisely, in Barcelona, more precisely, on the day of the great\
  \ match of the 1982 World Cup: Brazil versus Italy.\nI travelled with a friend who\
  \ I met a few months before the trip in a selection for monitors of young people\
  \ who wanted to make international exchange. It was in the interview that I realized\
  \ that my English, which included even Shakespeare and simultaneous translation,\
  \ was not enough for me to pass the test. And, very frustrated, I decided that my\
  \ first trip to Europe would include a month of an intensive English course.\nIt\
  \ was quite a plan for a first-time sailor! To start the trip in Barcelona, right\
  \ on the \"match day\" of 1982 World Cup, to watch Brazilian soccer team and, \"\
  of course\", to witness our victory. Then, to travel to Madrid, Italy, Switzerland,\
  \ Germany, France and finally to reach my destination: England, where I would take\
  \ an English course in the city of Cambridge.\nI remember arriving in Spain in a\
  \ hurry, leaving the backpacks in the luggage compartment Barcelona rail station,\
  \ taking a taxi, arriving at Sarri\xE1 Stadium, buying the tickets (and I still\
  \ I wonder how much the ticket cost and how I was able to buy it, because I traveled\
  \ with really little money). We wore the Brazilian t-shirts over our clothes, exactly\
  \ as we had planned.\nAt that point in the championship, Brazil needed only a draw\
  \ to qualify for the semifinals.\nI've always been that person that if you asked\
  \ me if I liked soccer, I would reply: \"only in the World Cups!\" It was a party\
  \ at home, the family would gather to watch the games, my mother would make delicious\
  \ appetizers, my father would serve beer and we would stay there, cheering, cheering,\
  \ and cheering together.\nWithout being able to watch the match, without understanding\
  \ much of soccer, I was very hopeful in that starry team that had Zico, Socrates,\
  \ Toninho Cerezo and Falcao. Out of a sudden, I saw Italy to open the score with\
  \ 1 x 0, with goal of Paolo Rossi, in the 5 initial minutes of the game. Socrates\
  \ managed to draw in the 12th minute and 11 minutes later, Paolo Rossi scored again\
  \ and made 2x1 for Italy.\nPain in the heart!\nThe stadium was full of Spaniards.\n\
  The Italians, and they were so many, did not miss the chance to tease those two\
  \ yellow-green girls.\nEnd of the break and we were still hopeful that Brazil would\
  \ get the draw in that difficult match. And it was 23 minutes after the restart\
  \ of the game that Falcao achieved what we both expected and needed so much: the\
  \ draw.\nHowever, however, however, however, there were still 22 minutes of regular\
  \ time remaining.\nThat day, oh, my goodness, Paolo Rossi was impossible.\nHe did\
  \ his 3rd goal 6 minutes after ours.\nItaly 3 x Brazil 2.\nEnd of a dream.\nEnd\
  \ of the World Cup for us.\nOh, boy, if I think about the World Cup\u2019s experiences\
  \ of our family...  My father was in Maracana Stadium, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,\
  \ in that final we lost to Uruguay, in 1950: 1x0, a goal at the very end of the\
  \ match that silenced the whole stadium.\nThen, in 1982, I witnessed the unannounced\
  \ defeat in Spain.\nMy stepdaughter witnessed another historic Brazilian defeat\
  \ in Belo Horizonte, when we played against Germany: 7x1, in 2014 World Cup in Brazil.\n\
  Let\u2019s go back to Sarri\xE1 Stadium, in Barcelona.\nEnd of the match.\nThe worst\
  \ of all?\nAs my friend and I did not take the Brazilian T-shirts off, as we left\
  \ the stadium, the Italians kept provoking us. \nI still remember they laughing\
  \ at us and saying to us, in Italian: \"Samba, Brasiliane*! \"\n\n* \"Dance the\
  \ Brazilian 'samba', Brazilian women!\""
