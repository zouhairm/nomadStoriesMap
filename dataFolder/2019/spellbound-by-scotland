Text: "So much mud, the not-so-apropos hiking shoes I wear flying into Edinburgh leave\
  \ me beatific after a flight that leaves me beat. Those clunky, purple accented\
  \ Merrells become my backbone during the most magical, mud-filled moments on this\
  \ solo sojourn.\n\nFrom skirting around a hastily erected fence sporting a \u201C\
  Walkway Closed\u201D sign. Handing a duffel bag with a week\u2019s worth of clothes\
  \ to a complete stranger to make the mud slick fence hop easier. I lose my breath\
  \ rounding a bend that opened on Dean Village and find solace at the foot of a bridge\
  \ notorious for suicides prior to the raising of the parapets in 1912.\n\nTo trudging\
  \ through the kirkyard mud, artfully dancing my way amongst a few jutting stones,\
  \ and slithering my way down a steep cemetery path like Nagini to land at the foot\
  \ of the gravestone of one Thomas Riddell Esq. Sidling up along the edge of the\
  \ group, gaining confidence greater than my solo-traveler shyness. Asserting my\
  \ height advantage over the gaggle of eight year olds, I find my voice 3,255 miles\
  \ from home.\n\u201CIt\u2019s an anagram,\u201D I say. \n\u201CTEN POINTS TO GRYFFINDOR!\u201D\
  \ bellows Charles, the Potter Trail extraordinaire, clearly proud his own house\
  \ has taken a lead here.\nMy literary-loving, teacher brain smiles smugly and wants\
  \ to add that fun fact that Voldemort\u2019s middle name is Elvis in French publications.\
  \ Oh, wait \u2013 Charles has already done it aloud and is beginning the upward\
  \ slip and slide onward to the rest of the tour. \nUltimately leaving me in a haze\
  \ on Victoria street, where I find the magic sans mud. I stand for an inordinate\
  \ amount on time slack-jawed, with a neon sign flashing tourist splayed prominently\
  \ above my head. Shuffling down Diagon Alley itself, I pass a few standard facades\
  \ and then continue past a rainbow on my right. A blur of vibrant turquoise is tempered\
  \ by cream with window trims that pop just like the the red-edged eyes I had after\
  \ my overnight haul with a few days earlier. This gives way to a fuchsia and blue\
  \ reminiscent of Santorini. I lose track of time, but find a set of photographs\
  \ that spark joy, that is after I remember to climb back up the hill and take them.\n\
  \nThen tackling the muddy hiking trails of Glencoe. Hugging the rock wall to my\
  \ right as the left drops unforgivingly down a ravine. Helping a girl in heels get\
  \ back to the bus. Forging connections. Fording streams. Proving the solo travel\
  \ experience is anything but lonely. I am a victim on the mountain paths, but find\
  \ that half-hiked is still enough to make me love this country with my whole heart.\
  \ Mud and all.\n\nFinally, purposefully face-planting in the icy Sligachan river\
  \ for the promise of eternal beauty. A river connected to the fairy pools on Skye,\
  \ a river harbouring an old magic. Our bright yellow bus pulls off into a small\
  \ parking area on the road to Portree. You know the drill by now. Avoiding mud puddles\
  \ in the parking lot and hopping from rock to rock while scrambling down the riverbank\
  \ to the right of the bridge, I approach the water.\n\u201CWho\u2019s joining me\
  \ today?\u201D comes the query from our guide, Chris. I find out how red water in\
  \ a place that averages sea temperatures between 6 and 9 degrees Celsius in April\
  \ makes a face after seven seconds submerged. It\u2019s somewhere between a strawberry\
  \ and the rush of blood pumping through my veins.\n\nThough magic was not all of\
  \ a fantasy series variety, most of came complete with mud.\nSo much mud, I probably\
  \ should\u2019ve claimed it at customs."
