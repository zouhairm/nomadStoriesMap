Text: "Sometimes the \u2018Journey\u2019 is beautiful than the \u2018Destination.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t believe this line from a famous Bollywood movie until I had a\
  \ wonderful experience at the Andaman Islands. To the southeast coast of India lies\
  \ the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. This has been my favourite destination. Famous\
  \ for the exotic- looking beaches, coral reefs, water sports and biodiversity, this\
  \ place has a lot to offer.  We were on our way to the Limestone caves from the\
  \ Baratang island main jetty. The sun was brightly shining and so were the mangrove\
  \ forests. Our boat made some ripples in the otherwise calm sea. The freshness in\
  \ the air added to the bliss. As we moved forward in the sea, I got engrossed in\
  \ photographing the seascapes. Suddenly our boat moved in something that seemed\
  \ like a narrow lane. The canopy of mangroves made the ambience darker. Thanga,\
  \ our driver cum guide, asked the boatman to slow down. The machine stopped and\
  \ so did the ripples. I switched the video mode on. Stabilizing my hand on the camera,\
  \ my eyes were tranquilized by the beauty of what I was experiencing. It seemed\
  \ as if we were deviated from the highway to a small road. We moved in close proximity\
  \ of what seemed like a Sea-Mangrove Jungle. Hands on the camera, eyes were engrossed\
  \ in visualization and my ears heard the stories shared by Thanga and our boatman.\
  \ The mangrove roots stood strong and firm, now and also during the Tsunami. This\
  \ was the least affected area due to the presence of mangroves. We heard some bird\
  \ calls on our way. There was a peculiar forest and sea mix aroma in the air, which\
  \ was now cooler than what it was earlier. Sunlight peeked in from the less dense\
  \ canopy intermittently.  We approached towards a long, wooden bridge. This was\
  \ the way to the Limestone Cave.  We walked by the mangrove names and other informative\
  \ boards on the bridge. After walking for about 5 minutes we entered into a human\
  \ habitat. It was a village where 10- 15 families resided peacefully. Mangrove jungle\
  \ acted like a barrier between the sea and the village. The residents were busy\
  \ with their daily chores like cattle grazing and farming. Huts were made of leaves,\
  \ branches and hides, a typical in the earthquake-prone area. Dogs, Pigs and goats\
  \ rested under the shadows of these huts. Some ducks quacked around as they played\
  \ with the hen family. We trekked from the village, sipping fresh coconut water.\
  \ At the entrance of the caves, we read information about the formation of caves.\
  \ The stalactites and stalagmites content in the same cave is a unique feature of\
  \ this place. One can interpret the shapes as per one\u2019s own imagination. A\
  \ small walk in the caves was coupled with the guide\u2019s entertaining narratives.\
  \ An informal chat with the snack vendors gave some more information about their\
  \ lifestyle. Walking back to the boat, I was enthralled by the fact that in this\
  \ technology-driven world, there still are people enjoying life in simple ways.\
  \ Born and brought up in Mumbai, my fondness for coastal destinations has no bounds.\
  \ Sitting by the sea and watching the sun setting in the horizon has been my favourite\
  \ activity. But experiencing this journey on the sea seemed different. A cave visit\
  \ seemed very simple in the beginning. But during the boat journey and the village\
  \ trek, I felt like taking a leap into the unknown. At every step, I was stunned\
  \ either by the miracles of nature or the human connection. As a person, I was apprehensive\
  \ about the ripples of the unknown things in my life. But this experience changed\
  \ my outlook towards unknown ripples and I look forward to take more such leaps."
