Text: "The river flowing beneath the Pont-du-Garde aqueducts is one of the stillest\
  \ I have ever seen. If it wasn\u2019t for the concrete knowledge that I was, in\
  \ fact, looking at the Rh\xF4ne River, I could have believed it was a teal piece\
  \ of glass, that I could step on top and walk all the way down to the Mediterranean.\
  \ The pane of the surface is spliced by black rock, a jagged row of trees, a porcelain\
  \ sky. It is as real on the surface of the water as it is above me. If I stare long\
  \ enough, the flip is almost confusing; the real and reflection are so identical.\
  \ I\u2019m flipped, too. Of course, I\u2019m still me: Caleigh Flegg, freshly 21,\
  \ student at Gettysburg College abroad in Aix-en-Provence for the semester. Daughter,\
  \ sister, friend. Still me, but I feel like that reflection on the Rh\xF4ne. The\
  \ same to the naked eye, but untouchable. Without the realness, the craggy rocks,\
  \ the weathered limbs. The roots. \nI sit on the banks of the river, surrounded\
  \ by the gentle chatter of my friends. Further beyond, Ponte-du-Garde is crawling\
  \ with American students, bustling in clumps everywhere. I can hear all of them,\
  \ but I feel a bit underwater, like they are re recognizable but distorted. We are\
  \ a week into the program, and I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment the whole\
  \ time; the first time I sit and wonder exactly what on this earth I am doing in\
  \ France, hours and miles away from everyone I love. As far as my categorizable\
  \ skills go, being alone ranks somewhere under spider-killing; that is to say, at\
  \ the very bottom. When I was little, concerned at my juxtaposition to my independent\
  \ younger sister, I went to my mom and told her that I, too, needed some alone \u201C\
  Well, how much time?\u201D My mother asked. I responded, \u201COh, maybe ten minutes.\
  \ More than that and I\u2019ll be lonely.\u201D\nI am the only person I know who\
  \ speaks with her parents every single day, even as a junior in college. My best\
  \ friends from high school and I facetime at least once a week. I haven\u2019t even\
  \ figured out how to be apart from my friends at Gettsyburg yet \u2013 our lives\
  \ revolve around each other. My life is my people. I did not realize the gravity\
  \ of those words until I came to Aix \u2013 maybe even until I just typed them out.\
  \ Even on that trip to the Rh\xF4ne, a week into Aix, I was walking around with\
  \ three girls I already cared deeply about. We were a group. Almost instantly, I\
  \ found what I needed. I am lucky, I know, to not be someone who finds it impossible\
  \ to make friends. Even now, I have friends who actually see me \u2013 my reflection\
  \ but also my craggy rocks, my deep water.  I have everything I want. \nSadly, though,\
  \ French me is not immune to the anxieties I felt in America. I don\u2019t miss\
  \ my parents as cripplingly much as I thought I would, but other thoughts sneak\
  \ in. As soon as I am alone, my mind still revs up, wondering where everyone is,\
  \ if they\u2019re okay. If I should be with them, or if I should be where I really\
  \ want to be. I think about my friends from home, my friends from school, my friends\
  \ in Aix, my family. Even in that moment on the water, worrying about me, I was\
  \ worrying about me in relationship to others. I\u2019m not just myself, reflected\
  \ on Aix but not really here; I reflect those I love. \nI\u2019m beginning to wonder\
  \ what I would look like if it was all stripped away \u2013 would I still bounce\
  \ back the sunshine, the lush grass, the cerulean sky? What would be left? But what\
  \ I do know for sure is that the river is still beautiful if no one is there to\
  \ see it. The water still flows, the trees still blossom, the fish still orbit in\
  \ the current. So maybe for now, I can be a reflection. Sometimes an almost-there,\
  \ sometimes untouchable, but rich with the untapped possibilities of still water."
