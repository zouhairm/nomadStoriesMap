Text: "And at last, 17 years after I was born, there would come my first trip abroad.\
  \ I remember most happily those early hours in 1999. Going out with my little suitcase\
  \ to take the bus that would drive me to the Las Americas airport in the capital\
  \ city was unforgettable; such a feeling of confetti falling all around me.\n\n\
  After the now routine security check, which was totally new to me back then, and\
  \ a short wait before boarding, everything was ready; I was going to Caracas, Venezuela.\
  \ For the first time I was able to see my land from above, and not just the horizon\
  \ as I did so many times longing for this moment.\n\nAfter about two hours in the\
  \ air, I could see through the window the coasts of Maiquet\xEDa as the airplane\
  \ descended towards my destination, the Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar airport. There started\
  \ a journey that would become for me the best image I have been able to keep from\
  \ that beautiful country, which is nowadays living so many tragedies.\n\nThe Palacio\
  \ de Miraflores was something else, walking through the Sabana Grande Boulevard\
  \ was something else, the Sim\xF3n Bol\xEDvar plaza, the Venevision building, the\
  \ Margarita Island, the impressive Tovar Colony, all were places that left me beautiful\
  \ memories, and today I feel sorry to hear what they have become.\n\nBut no wrong\
  \ can last forever, and I know that the Venezuela that received me in such a beauty\
  \ will soon regain its brilliance, and there I will be, visiting again to jog the\
  \ image that stuck in my mind, so I could tell: THERE YOU ARE, JUST AS I REMEMBER\
  \ YOU, BEAUTIFUL VENEZUELA."
