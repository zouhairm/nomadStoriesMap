Text: "Traveling feels like living inside a great film. Time slows down, colors seem\
  \ richer and lines seem sharper. I notice things as if my eye is a camera guided\
  \ by a director. Here is a tabby sunning itself on the roof of a sun-bleached car;\
  \ here is a man with a cigarette, chatting quietly with his neighbor on an adjacent\
  \ balcony. Here is a quiet moment in an old hotel room, and a mote of dust suspended\
  \ in a beam of light. In moments like these, the plot of my life story no longer\
  \ matters. I am buoyed up and up by the goodness of being, until I too am suspended\
  \ in light. \nWhen I left my aunt\u2019s house in Albuquerque, I hoped to be buoyed\
  \ up by beauty. After visiting, I borrowed Gramma\u2019s Ford station wagon and\
  \ headed North, alone. No smartphone, no GPS, just an Atlas. I wanted to see Colorado,\
  \ but beyond that, no plan. On the heels of a breakup, I was another romantic looking\
  \ to get lost in the Great American West.\n\nDays later I found myself in a town\
  \ called Gothic, Southwest of Aspen. Heading into the mountains on a wide, even\
  \ dirt road, I entered a forest of silent birch. I pulled into my campsite as the\
  \ sun set, and was invited to a fire by my new neighbor, a gregarious, athletic\
  \ man in his late sixties. There were two Oklahomans, one broad chested man with\
  \ an easy laugh, and a tall man with a steady gaze, slim, sturdy, with a strong\
  \ nose and dark mustache. He reminded me so much of Daniel Day Lewis I suspect I\u2019\
  ve superimposed Lewis\u2019 face onto all my memories of him. \nAs twilight faded\
  \ to dusk, I shared these strangers\u2019 beers and learned about their lives. The\
  \ Oklahoman with the moustache had been coming to Gothic since he was a kid, exploring\
  \ the shuttered mines in the area. When the land was being sold to the government\
  \ for preservation purposes in the 70s, he managed to purchase one of them. He paid\
  \ $1000 for it. \u201CThe tracks that lead up to the mines are from the 1800s,\u201D\
  \ he said. \u201CBecause I own the mine, I\u2019m the only person who gets to drive\
  \ \u2018em.\u201D He gestured to his Jeep, a 50s era vintage painted an immaculate\
  \ red. \u201CWe\u2019re going up tomorrow morning. If you want, you can come along.\u201D\
  \n\nI didn\u2019t decide until the next morning whether I would join. I had seen\
  \ a case\u2019s worth of beer cans on the floor of the passenger side. Pushing axe-murder\
  \ scenarios from my mind, I decided to go along. I hopped in the back of the Jeep,\
  \ and we rumbled out of the campsite and further North. On the wagon trail, and\
  \ the hills were speckled with wildflowers, red, yellow, white and lavender. The\
  \ man with the moustache stopped at the gate, unlocked it, and we drove through.\
  \ He purred along slowly, waving at outraged hikers as we went. It was a silver\
  \ mine, he told me. Loose rock had fallen back down into the mine over the years.\
  \ We would clear some of it out. Continuing upward, the smell of flowers mingled\
  \ with a the sweet smell of unfiltered exhaust. \nOver rocks and ditches, up and\
  \ up. We entered a half circle of mounts, and he cut the engine. To the left of\
  \ the Jeep was the mine, up a steep hill littered with loose rock. I was sweating\
  \ when I got to the top, and I stepped down into the mineshaft. The man showed me\
  \ around proudly, and fished around on the ground until he found me a piece of ore.\
  \ We shoveled loose stone and tossed it down the hill as clouds gathered. A few\
  \ hailstones fell, and soon we were being pelted by dime sized pellets. We ran into\
  \ the mine for cover. When I got inside I turned around and looked out. The man\
  \ stood at the entrance, face silhouetted by the sun, looking quietly out at the\
  \ land with hail coming down around him. Time slowed down, and the picture sharpened.\
  \ The image is etched in my memory like a piece of film."
