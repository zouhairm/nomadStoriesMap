Text: "It was the best and worst year of my life.  My husband and I were on a year-long\
  \ journey circling the globe.  We swam with whales, camped in deserts, hiked mountains\
  \ and explored countless temples and ruins.  We were having the time of our lives,\
  \ yet I couldn\u2019t help but feel like our marriage was crumbling.\n\nIn between\
  \ our adventures exploring neighbourhoods, eating new foods and meeting locals,\
  \ the year of travel was punctuated with days of sitting in a hotel room or apartment,\
  \ trying to work through our difficulties.  These were not the kind of days I was\
  \ expecting when planning for this trip.  We had already been married for 10 years\
  \ and our relationship was pretty much settled and secure, with only minor issues\
  \ every now and then.  Somehow this year of travel changed everything between us.\
  \  Even though we spent over 300 consecutive days together, we had forgotten how\
  \ to truly talk to each other.  Over this time, the miscommunications grew more\
  \ common and the tension seemed to separate us.  We had more disagreements and tears\
  \ during this single year than our entire lifetime together.  Somewhere along the\
  \ way, I had convinced myself that if things didn\u2019t improve before the end\
  \ of our trip, Simon was going to leave me.\n\nToward the end of our trip, while\
  \ standing on beautiful Cape Milazzo in Sicily, I felt our relationship was truly\
  \ coming to an end.\n\nWe had spent the last few weeks driving around the island,\
  \ hiking Mount Etna and watching it erupt, wandering the numerous port cities, sampling\
  \ the delicious pizza and meeting the local farmers to taste their amazing fruit.\
  \  The Sicilians we met were so hospitable and vibrant, making us feel welcome and\
  \ at home during our stays.  It was truly a paradise with scenic landscapes, friendly\
  \ locals and abundant food.  Despite these wonderful experiences, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but continue to feel that we were going to separate.  That night, while watching\
  \ a beautiful sunset with craggy cliffs atop the ocean at the Cape Milazzo lighthouse,\
  \ my thoughts careened dangerously toward the conclusion that our relationship was\
  \ coming to an end.  Later in our hotel room, I finally shared my deepest fears\
  \ and learned it was all for nothing.  Simon had no intentions of ending anything,\
  \ it was simply a misunderstanding. \n Why had I waited almost a year to ask my\
  \ husband the simplest of questions?  To truly talk to him and listen to him?  Even\
  \ though we were physically closest together during this trip, we were mentally\
  \ the furthest apart.\n\nThroughout our travels, we always planned and allowed for\
  \ time to slow down and relax, letting us simply take pause from all the sightseeing\
  \ and activity.  We made sure we took care of ourselves and each other, but we never\
  \ thought to take care of our relationship \u2013 we were too focussed on travelling,\
  \ eating and exploring.  We somehow assumed our relationship would stay the same,\
  \ even though we were continually changing with each new experience.  Since that\
  \ night in Milazzo, we continued our journey with new perspectives.  We took more\
  \ time to learn how to talk to each other and acknowledged that things will continue\
  \ to grow and change for us, both individually and as a couple.  Our year of travel\
  \ accelerated our relationship by a hundred-fold and without our struggles, we truly\
  \ wouldn\u2019t have ever known how strong our bond could become.  It allowed us\
  \ to learn more about ourselves and each other, more so than during the entire decade\
  \ we were together before.\n\nOur love of travel and each other has not stopped\
  \ since.  We now live abroad and continue to work on ourselves and our relationship.\
  \  Although we still have issues to work through from time to time, we know that\
  \ our efforts will make us stronger and our relationship will only continue to deepen\
  \ as it changes.  Our year of travel passed us by so quickly but will always remain\
  \ as a significant turning point in our lives.  It was the best and worst year of\
  \ my life \u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way."
