Text: 'In each and every state of India there are Many District but as an officer
  I recently posted 8n jhalawar district in Rajasthan near MP Border. When I came
  here I don''t know anyone in this district as far as I spend time in Jhalawar I
  m getting some good local Connection and knowing their culture. The Main thing in
  jhalawar which attracts me more that their is a community .

  In this community when someone take birth they crying for that why you take birth
  in this community and if someone dies they celebrate like they won something. First
  time some people told me for this community I make fun of them but one day in morning
  when I was riding my bike and suddenly i saw that the group of people were crying
  on road just like somebody dies in their family. After few days again I m riding
  my bike and I saw that these people where celebrating with DJ sounds and dancing
  on Road then I stop my bike and talk with local then he said in this community only
  this opposite from other all community in India . Then I understand all this episode
  of the community. They didn''t have any home they lived in taint house .

  The local food of Jhalawar is save tamator Sabji. The people of Jhalawar were very
  helpful but bleongs from Rajasthan there no tourist attraction place. Jungle are
  attractive with nature . Rainfall in Jhalawar is much more than other district in
  Rajasthan.'
