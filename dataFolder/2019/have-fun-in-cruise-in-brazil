Text: "Go on a Cruise in Brazil was a leap into the unknown, because traveling on\
  \ the sea was something totally new to me. It was a wonderful trip with dear friends\
  \ to celebrate our college graduation. The trip was in December, when it is summer\
  \ in Brazil. The cruise left the port of Santos, which is in S\xE3o Paulo, with\
  \ destination to Rio de Janeiro (Cabo Frio Beach).\n On the first day, we embark\
  \ from the port of Santos, which is an organized place and, besides making the dispatch\
  \ of luggage, there you can find snack bars and exchange house if you need to. After\
  \ that, we entered the ship and noticed a lot of elegance and how big and well structure\
  \ it was. Also, the cabin was cozy, with comfortable beds, soft towels and even\
  \ had hair dryer. At the night, we had a round on the ship and had our first gala\
  \ dinner, washed down with great joy and Italian food.\nIn addition, the cruise\
  \ has a schedule with several events that take place at the same time, such as night\
  \ parties, musical show and casino. Further to these attractions, guests can enjoy\
  \ the local swimming pool, spa services (fees apply), golf club, gym and clothing\
  \ stores, accessories and souvenirs.\nOn the second day, we woke up early to get\
  \ the most out of our day on the beach. We got off the ship in Cabo Frio, a simply\
  \ amazing beach, with white sand, very clean water and nice waves. It was sunny\
  \ all day and we really enjoyed this place. So, at the night we went to watch a\
  \ musical with Italian music, which it was an exciting show.\nOn the third day,\
  \ we disembarked on island called Ilha Bela in S\xE3o Paulo, a spectacular place.\
  \ Near the landing we purchased a tour package ,that included touring the city in\
  \ a  van, with stops in the main points of the city, such as: local church, banks,\
  \ restaurants, bars, nautical museum, local commerce and with final destination\
  \ on the Curral Beach , in which we take advantage of the tranquility of calm and\
  \ transparent waters. In the downtown you will find various handicrafts and swimwear\
  \ of varying prices. A good tip, for those who want to save money, is to buy bathing\
  \ suits in the beach stalls, including payment by credit card machine.\nFurthermore,\
  \ in the ship the meals were plentiful and one could eat at will. We had breakfast\
  \ in the morning, then went to the beach (where we had lunch) and had dinner on\
  \ the ship. If anyone wanted to have lunch on the ship, it would be possible; however,\
  \ you would have to wait for the boat's time to the moored ship. We thought it more\
  \ practical to have lunch on the beach.\nOn the last night, we had the famous White\u2019\
  s Party, in which everyone dressed in white. The decoration around the pool was\
  \ beautiful, had good music, animated people, colorful and tasty drinks. In addition,\
  \ there were professional ship dancers who taught us some steps of some music. We\
  \ made the most of it and at dawn we sat on the stern of ship and waited for the\
  \ sunset over the sea. Then in the last day we just had our breakfast and disembarked\
  \ in port of Santos.\nIn conclusion, for those who want to have fun and make the\
  \ most of the trip route and destinations, the cruise can be an ideal option. You\
  \ can have many things just one place and to know a new places too. Traveling on\
  \ a cruise is a fun and unique experience."
