Text: "Mrs. Toula lives alone in an apartment above the \u201Crestaurant\u201D she\
  \ owns on a small street. The restaurant is really more of a large room with one\
  \ long table and two smaller ones, a television set and a kitchen area with a stove,\
  \ counter and refrigerator/freezer that looks as old as it probably is.\n\nKyrie\
  \ Toula, as she is known to the other 19 residents in the tiny northern Greek village\
  \ of Piana, is in her 80s with the health problems and signs of aging one might\
  \ expect from advancing years.\n\nShe greets me and my companions with a gentle\
  \ smile, slight hunch and big bottle of red wine. She follows with a Greek salad,\
  \ some overcooked pork chunks and potatoes roasted in her ancient oven. It is a\
  \ feast of joy offered with love and gratitude.\n\nThe old lady smiles as if she\
  \ has known us forever, and tells us tales of what it\u2019s like to live in a remote\
  \ part of Greece. Her neighbors are also elderly widows living alone. Their spouses\
  \ are long gone and children have moved to faraway cities. The village has a brief\
  \ period in winter when snow on the ground entices visitors to stay in the lovely\
  \ hotel nearby and ski for a few days. This is not the Greece you see on postcards.\
  \ Not even close.\n\nA bus comes to the village once a week but Mrs. Toula is not\
  \ strong enough to ride it to do her grocery shopping. If she is lucky, she can\
  \ give her shopping list and money to someone on the bus who will purchase her goods\
  \ and bring them to her when the bus returns. Sometimes she\u2019s lucky, sometimes\
  \ she\u2019s not.\n\nEven in this poor small village where the empty buildings far\
  \ outnumber the occupied ones, Mrs. Toula has been burglarized and is afraid. She\
  \ worries that a disappointed thief will beat her up when she says she has nothing\
  \ but a few Euros. She has been robbed before. Her fear is real, and to us visiting,\
  \ unimaginable.\n\nWhenever I travel, I try to meet with locals to learn more about\
  \ the food scene, the hidden treasures that tourists don\u2019t often find and the\
  \ cultural traditions of those living in the destination. Such encounters typically\
  \ provide me with the satisfaction of knowing I\u2019ve unearthed a more interesting\
  \ and authentic travel experience.\n\nMy connection with Mrs. Toula was not like\
  \ those. It filled me with a deeper sense of kinship tinged with a bit of sadness.\
  \ I somehow felt an obligation to make her world a more pleasant place because she\
  \ got to spend time with me, and to let her know sincerely how much her hospitality\
  \ had touched and impressed me. \n\nThough I couldn\u2019t understand or speak her\
  \ language, we shared a joyful evening over the modest meal. Local ingredients were\
  \ lovingly prepared by experienced hands and presented with grace. Laughter is universal\
  \ and there was much to be had among our merry group dining like honored guests\
  \ at Mrs. Toula\u2019s long table.  \n\nShe delightedly told us that she got the\
  \ feta cheese for our salad from a gentleman goat farmer down the road. She shared\
  \ her pride in the beautiful village where she raised her family, even though it\
  \ was now just a sliver of its former self.\n\nI loved the many hugs and kisses\
  \ and blessings she offered freely as we said goodbye. And, unusual for me, I offered\
  \ some of my own in return. \nFrequent travelers say that travel provides an unparalleled\
  \ education. I\u2019ve said that myself. Making a local connection can offer insight\
  \ into the truth of a place and its people. And making a connection with a local\
  \ like Mrs. Toula can expand your understanding far beyond anything you ever imagined.\
  \ \n\nNorthern Greece is full of surprises like snowy winter ski resorts, beautiful\
  \ colored fall foliage and apples growing alongside lemons. All of which beckon\
  \ me to visit again. But the most powerful magnet to my return is the voice of a\
  \ tiny old lady with gnarled hands, a beautiful smile and a spot at her table that\
  \ will make me feel like a local forever."
