  If I could choose a word to describe this moment, this word should be Inspiration.\n\
  Everything that happened here it was fantastic, but let me take you back when I\
  \ was 15 years old. It was there that started all those wishes to travel, I observed\
  \ that something was different on me and I simply cannot fix in that comfort . I\
  \ wanted more, I wanted explore the world in a different way, not just in the history\
  \ books.\nWhen I was 19, I made a little and I put in my wardrobe like a goal, the\
  \ list called 30 countries before 30's.\nThat was actually my motivation, like every\
  \ morning I looked at that and speak to myself:\nOne day, I'll explore each place!\n\
  I started to dream, save money, risk. The first place in my priority list it was\
  \ United States, a place that I could not die before go there. \nSo I  decided to\
  \ plan the trip, I made a passport, search about  particularities of the country,\
  \ and apply for a visa. I was refused twice and the vacation was close.\nSo, I was\
  \ invited to go to Portugal for 20 days! Lisbon was in my list, but I didn't knew\
  \ how fast this dream was came true.\nHere starts my story, the frist place to be\
  \ visited in that list, it was exciting! \nWhen I came there I was so sure about\
  \ life,  full of pessimism. Lisbon arrived in a perfect moment of my life, because\
  \ in  Brazil I was feeling very bad, I wasn't myself anymore. It was like, that\
  \  rest  and I can't go out of that black hole.\nBut let's talk about good things,\
  \ all the stuffs was collaborating to go there! I took a  flight of 25h (stop over\
  \ in Germany). It was terrifying! First trip abroad, it was the frist time traveling\
  \ alone and the first  that I took a flight! A lot of turbulences! When I saw Portugal\
  \ flying, I felt wonderful! My eyes was shining bright.\nSintra was amazing, I did\
  \ my first picnic and visited Monteserrate palace, it was a lot of culture in the\
  \ same place, indian, greek and portuguese.\nI've learned about the history about\
  \ that country, everything there always have an explanation.\nI didn't realized\
  \ but in that moment started a big change in my life, a perspective of a person\
  \ who was finding yourself.\nI thought: \"If everything in my life that heppened\
  \ it was so bad, in Portugal something good could happen.\"\nIt was true, that happened\
  \ and I'll tell you soon!\nI did a car tour with lovely Rosa, my friend's mom.\n\
  Oh, that woman! She's so good, she was a great guest and gave me the besties local\
  \ foods, showed me a lot of great  and treated me like a son.\nI went  Blue Lake,\
  \ Sintra, Guincho, Boca do Inferno, Cascais. It was wonderful!\nShe took me in the\
  \ center of Lisbon and then I took a taxi.\nWhen I was in taxi,I realized that was\
  \ true, I was there, I saw Lisbon at night and my heart was beating very fast! I\
  \ could not believe that I was really there!\nContinue...."
