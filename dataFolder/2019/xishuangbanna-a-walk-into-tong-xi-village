Text: "My recent travels back to China was rewarding to say the very least. A growing\
  \ curiosity towards the beautiful unknown had taken me to Xishuangbanna, where I\
  \ made an insider visit to a traditional Dai village along with a group of likeminded\
  \ travellers.\n\nEarly one morning, our tour bus arrived at Gasazhen. Waiting for\
  \ us patiently was a girl dressed in brightly coloured clothing and a few villagers\
  \ near the entrance. We were greeted with a very warm welcome as we made our way\
  \ inside doing a water cheer dance.\n\nTong Xin Village was home to around 400 people.\
  \ 90 families lived here all with a Dai ethnic background. This village rich of\
  \ history had underwent some changes following an evolution of Yunnan tourism, but\
  \ its ancient customs lived on. Traditions carried down from generation to generation\
  \ has made the Dais into one of the most well known ethnic minority groups in China.\n\
  \nXiaoyu (our guide) spoke in fluent mandarin as she uncovered some of the wonders\
  \ of the thriving Dai culture. I became drawn to the ways these villagers had lived.\
  \ It was organic, simple, and yet quite exquisite. We walked along the cement roads\
  \ passing courtyards full of bananas, papayas, coconuts, mangoes, as well as various\
  \ plants that could not be named. It was a walk accompanied by pleasant scents of\
  \ ripping fruits and blooming flowers. No wonder why people here lived long and\
  \ healthy.\n\nWe stopped by a half ruined golden temple to admire the beautifully\
  \ preserved Dai architecture. There was just the most incredible details carved\
  \ upon its oblique roofs. Buddhism is a religion most Dais believed in. Boys would\
  \ be sent to temples at a young age to learn the sacred writings. There's a century-old\
  \ bodhi tree at the heart of the village. The villagers had an enlightened heart\
  \ just like the bodhi, and the genuine kindliness channelling through one another.\n\
  \nI didn't get to take any photos of the villagers, for it was seen as taking their\
  \ soul away. Xiaoyu took us to her home, an old two story house built out of bamboo\
  \ and wooden stilts. The design kept the family safe from floods, bugs, and animals.\
  \ Before entering, she reminded us to respect the three family customs. One off\
  \ (shoes off); two touch (touch the red column upon entering, giving both the guest\
  \ and the host blessings and good fortune); three never look (never look inside\
  \ the family bedroom, for it was the most intimate and private place in the house).\
  \ Everyone in the family would sleep in one big room together, divided by different\
  \ coloured sheets hanging from the ceiling.\n\nWe sat on small wooden stools in\
  \ the living room and enjoyed some local Pu'er tea. Time flew quickly as we listened\
  \ to more of Xiaoyu's stories. She spoke with a kind of passion and light you could\
  \ almost feel. I didn't want to leave. I was struck when I heard that Tong Xin village\
  \ was run by females, and Xiaoyu was one of the candidates for an upcoming election.\
  \ Education and marriage life was favoured to the women in the village. The village\
  \ treasured girls so much they would host a festive banquet for every time a girl\
  \ was born into the family. The Dai's fine silver craftsmanship was an art of the\
  \ ages. From belts to combs to tea sets... Every fine silverware would be handcrafted\
  \ by the villagers. When the men married into the girl\u2019s family, they were\
  \ tested upon three years of hard work, the third entailed learning the traditional\
  \ ways for processing silver. \n\nI've always been a traveller with a strong desire\
  \ for learning. It's through travel, we discover, we understand, and we connect.\
  \ I left the Dai village that day in awe and bewilderment. There was just something\
  \ content about the local people there that made me wonder about life in this modern\
  \ age. My impressions for China had changed. It was no longer the land full of grey\
  \ skies and growing crowds, but a country of endless diverse cultures for new people\
  \ to explore."
