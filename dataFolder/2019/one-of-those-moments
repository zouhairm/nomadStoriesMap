Text: 'In your lifetime, you have only a few moments. A few moments that will remain
  crystal clear for the rest of your time here. one of those moments, happened in
  Japan. In the quiet village of Takayama in the brief days between Christmas and
  New Years. I''d taken time to look into small quiet towns up close to the mountains
  and Takayama provided the perfect serenity that I was expecting. I stepped off the
  train and found myself facing cool winds that would later bring one of these moments.
  I''d gotten used to the quiet as I walked through the small roads toward the hostel
  I would spend three days in. Checking in, I unpacked my belongings in my hostel
  room, spending some time planning my days in advance.

  I then felt my stomach rumbling and embarked on the daily journey of finding a little
  hole in the wall local food joint. However, as I stepped out, a snowflake landed
  on my shoulder. I looked up and found that there were small snowflakes falling from
  the sky. Each unique, different and cold at the touch. I found myself smiling. Coming
  from a country that had very rare occasions of snow, this was unique to me. As I
  walked to find my dinner, I found myself unable to stifle my smile. Months later
  as I write this, the spark of joy that I felt on that day recalls that smiles and
  sense of wonder I felt. The memory is crystal clear as though it happened yesterday.
  Its one of those moments walking through the small snow storm in Takayama by myself
  that I couldn''t help but smile every time I remembered.'
