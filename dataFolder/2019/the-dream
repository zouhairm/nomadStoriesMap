Text: "I've always loved reality more than artificial lives on social media. I would\
  \ watch the road for hours in the way to any place I go instead of staring at my\
  \ phone. watching roads is so delightful to me as it gives me various new feelings\
  \ and keeps me thinking about stories of unknown heroes in very ordinary places,\
  \ but once the same road is repeated over and over every day, those feelings start\
  \ to fade and the stories start to be so similar to each other. That thought hit\
  \ me on my way home after a long day in college. \n      I got off the micro-bus\
  \ in front of the hotel at the end of the street I live in. I was about to start\
  \ my 10-minute walk home when the sound of a tour bus door opening stopped me. I\
  \ saw a group of tourists getting off the tour bus headed to the hotel. They seemed\
  \ so happy, Egypt's dark hot sun shined against their so white skin in an amazingly\
  \ beautiful contrast. I wondered how they felt on their way to the hotel, how they\
  \ felt watching those completely different roads, new places, and Egyptian people.\
  \ I kept staring as I began to walk away. I went home, entered my room to take my\
  \ usual post-college nap.\n      I woke up to the sound of my alarm announcing that\
  \ my flight is 3 hours from now. I jumped out of bed with enthusiasm, got ready,\
  \ and pulled my suitcase out of the front door headed to the airport not even knowing\
  \ the destination of my flight. I pulled out my ticket to see that I was going to\
  \ Iceland. A few more hours passed before I was boating on a glacier lake filled\
  \ with ice crystals. I felt joy like never before, my heart bumped, and I could\
  \ feel my pulse in my fingertips. I started to feel dizziness that I didn't know\
  \ whether it was from the water all around me or from excitement. The cold weather\
  \ that I have never experienced before hit my skin like a bomb. At the same moment,\
  \ I saw a big ice crystal approaching and a whole set of new feelings exploded in\
  \ my whole body. I took off the glove in my right hand ready to touch the ice. Once\
  \ I did, I smiled automatically as I saw my sun-kissed tanned hand against the white\
  \ color of the snow. the contrast gave me shivers. Now I know how it feels to be\
  \ in a completely distinct place,  feel completely new feelings and think of offbeat\
  \ stories. It was truly beautiful.\n      Suddenly I started to see other people\
  \ on boats around me that I didn't notice before. They were speaking many different\
  \ languages that I didn't understand. That was like magic to me. People say completely\
  \ different words that mean the same thing. My boat moved around slowly and all\
  \ I did was watch this new road,  that was far beyond new actually, a road made\
  \ of water and decorated with ice jewels. I enjoyed the unusual unique feelings\
  \ and thoughts until I heard the sound of my alarm again. This time I can't locate\
  \ where this sound is coming from. I looked around and everything started to fade.\
  \ The lake started to have wall borders, the water is replaced with my room floor,\
  \ and the ice is replaced with the few pieces of furniture I own. I fully opened\
  \ my eyes, reached for my phone, turned off my alarm, and smiled. I found a new\
  \ dream to fulfill. I found a passion."
