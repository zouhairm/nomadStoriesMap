Text: "i decided to travel to Georgia (Tbilisi ) which its a green place and different\
  \ country to visit. and explore all the country and try new activities and meet\
  \ new people , last 2018/07 my trip started ,\nGeorgian language >> the most words\
  \ you will hear is gamarjoba and it means hello , and rogor xar > it means how are\
  \ you .\ni traveled to Tbilisi from sharm el sheikh Egypt ( red sea ) i arrived\
  \ to Tbilisi the weather was amazing and raining , i booked a cheap hostel of 7\
  \ lari per night to stay , i met some people from Germany and Poland and stared\
  \ to explore the city with the most cheapest way and trying all the Georgian food\
  \ was really amazing  the best 2 of them are , khinkali and its a meat dumpling))\
  \ The meat is uncooked when it's wrapped up in the dough , its tasty and i recommend\
  \ it to people who visits there and  khachapuri as well , its a traditional Georgian\
  \ dish of cheese-filled bread. usually with cheese in the middle and a crust which\
  \ is ripped off and used to dip in the cheese . transportation really cheap metro\
  \ ticket is for 0.5 lari only which its about 0.20 cents . public bus has the same\
  \ price as well , we went to the cable car above the green mountain and the ticket\
  \ approx about 3$ .  the day after we went for a paragliding )) and we went to explore\
  \ all the other places to finish up with Tbilisi because there is another cities\
  \ waiting for us .)\n-we went to Holy Trinity Cathedral (Tsminda Sameba) :its the\
  \ tallest church in all of Tbilisi and recognized as a symbol of  \u201DNew Georgia\u201D\
  . \n-we went to Mtatsminda Park : its a friendly park for kids and families >>))\n\
  -we went to Old Town Tbilisi : historic capital city in the heart of Georgia has\
  \ been built rebuilt many times.\n--- then we finished up with that and prepared\
  \ ourselves to checkout from the hostel in the morning to go to kutaisi city which\
  \ its very old city and even it doesn't have any modern homes or flats , for i adore\
  \ this city i like calm places to think and relax we stayed there for 1 week people\
  \ of that city very few and usually after 7 pm you cannot see anybody in the street\
  \ , you can go to the city by train from Gori approx 4 hours , there are many hostels\
  \ and cheap to stay in Kutaisi <\n-Kutaisi Botanical Garden :and it has so many\
  \ flowers and old ones and not possible to touch any of them for your safety and\
  \ not to hurt the flowers.\n-Okatse Canyon & ataplia Nature Reserve : these places\
  \ are my favorite , :) it has green and blue hues of the water ,trees and mossy\
  \ rocks are pretty phenomenal.\nwe finished up with my lovely city and the calm\
  \ one and prepared ourselves to leave and to go to batumi  ) i love this city too\
  \ because for sure its the city of the black sea !!\n-we booked a cozy and clean\
  \ hostel there for 11 lari per night , \n-we booked for the Argo Cable Car: its\
  \ a sightseeing attraction located on Anuria Mountain in Batumi, which its a 250\
  \ meters high from the sea level.)\nbatumi its  2-3 hours from turkey borders its\
  \ very near by . the road from tbilisi city is about 6-7 hours by car and by train\
  \ is about 5 hours max .\nif you like the zigzag ways and have a drone and would\
  \ like to shot a beautiful video ?! so for sure i recommend you to rent a car .\n\
  Georgian Police very responsive and helpful as they care about the travelers nicely\
  \ but take care of roads( patrol police ::)  . here i will end my story with something\
  \ i really learnt, to be more wise , travel , meet new people and never stop learning\
  \ and exploring new places , the day you travel its a thousand day of people who\
  \ are staying at the same place were they was yesterday )) . i have a lot to share\
  \ and a lot to do and launch :) see you on board !!"
