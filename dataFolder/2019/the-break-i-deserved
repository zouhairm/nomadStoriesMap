  \u201D this is one of the many Bollywood songs that were being played on loop in\
  \ my car\u2019s radio for this journey. It is said that a friendship is really built\
  \ when you take a trip with your friends. This is not a story of how close I got\
  \ to my friends after the trip or how when I was on this trip, I had an epiphany\
  \ and it changed me for ever. \n\nI along with my two friends left our homes to\
  \ take a trip to Chandigarh which is approximately 300 kms. from Delhi. It had been\
  \ a few months since my last chemotherapy and I was feeling a lot stronger that\
  \ I hadn\u2019t felt in almost a year. \n \nThe three of us are school friends and\
  \ now as we were almost done with our colleges this trip came as a break for all\
  \ of us. Of course, a lot of things had to be put into consideration, specially\
  \ for me before finalizing this trip. Any who I got everyone\u2019s approval and\
  \ we were ready to go. 3 days, that\u2019s how many days the doctors approved would\
  \ be enough for me. Well considering how my last year had been, full of hospital\
  \ visits, chemotherapies, and sleeping so many nights on hospital beds, this was\
  \ a welcome change for me.\n\n\u201CSuno suno senorita, kehte hai ham Kya\u2026\u201D\
  \ the change of the song brought me back from the memories of last year, when I\
  \ was diagnosed with Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma and my worst nightmare came true. But\
  \ here I was, with the best company in the world, singing our favorite songs and\
  \ laughing while remembering our school\u2019s memories.\n \nWe reached Chandigarh\
  \ after 5 hours ride and checked into our room. \n\nThe first place we went to that\
  \ evening was the famous Sukhna Lake. We booke\n\nd a boat for the three of us,\
  \ took it to the middle of the lake and stopped pedaling. One of my friend took\
  \ out his ukulele and started serenading our favorites from Bollywood. Our boat\
  \ just floated on water for almost an hour, we didn\u2019t talk and yet there was\
  \ a smile on our faces. I hadn\u2019t felt that calm inside of me since a long time.\
  \ We just spent around 2 hours on the lake, but it refreshed us.\n\n \nLater that\
  \ evening we went to the market and bought Business, the board game. As kids we\
  \ used to play it all the time. And that night after dinner we sat again in the\
  \ laps of our childhood and played till around 7 am.\n \nNext day we visited a couple\
  \ more places and later that night as we reached the room, we followed our routine\
  \ from the previous day of playing our newly found love for Business that we once\
  \ shared as kids.\n \nThe next day we left Chandigarh around 2 pm in the afternoon.\
  \ Not a perfect time to leave the city and travel as the sun was at its highest\
  \ and it was hot. But would you blame us that we woke up so late after playing all\
  \ night and going to sleep in the morning.\n\n\u201CChand sifarish jo karta hamari\u2026\
  \u201D with this song we started our way back home. I have taken a lot of other\
  \ trips to different parts of India, more entertaining than this trip. But this\
  \ trip is so close to my heart because of the circumstances that I took it in. \n\
  \nThe last year was difficult for everyone around me and it wasn't perfect after\
  \ coming from there. I had my bone marrow transplant last year and now I\u2019m\
  \ cancer free. But this trip with two of my best friends came when I least anticipated\
  \ it, but needed the most at that time. When, I look back at the last couple of\
  \ years, and how far I have come, this trip is the one thing that brings a big smile\
  \ my face. And yes, it was a hard time but not a one that I would ever like to forget\
  \ as I believe it has helped me grow in so many spheres of my life."
