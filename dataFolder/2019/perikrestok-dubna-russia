Text: "I walk into Perikrestok, my neighborhood supermarket in Dubna, Russia, for\
  \ my first attempt at doing grocery-shopping in this foreign country. No stranger\
  \ to technology, I walk in there with my iPhone on Google Translate, ready to overcome\
  \ any language barrier in millennial fashion. I walk into the unassuming-looking\
  \ two story building through two glass doors located about a meter and a half apart\
  \ - to keep the negative thirty degree celsius outside outside, no doubt. Inside\
  \ Perikrestok, I'm surrounded by familiar produce laid out in a classic \"supermarket\"\
  \ interior - dairy, meat, bread, some tantalizing-looking treats close to the teller\
  \ in case you left home with the sole purpose of buying tomatoes but chocolate-covered\
  \ hazelnuts stared at you as you were already paying the bill (they were only fifteen\
  \ ruble).\n\nI start at the dairy isle (classic shopping tactic: milk, butter, cheese,\
  \ next isle). \"Moloko\". I check my phone for the translation of what I assume\
  \ is milk and... nothing. I was on the verge of having an internal complain regarding\
  \ the state of mobile reception in this small research town when I remember that\
  \ this unassuming-looking building has walls about a meter and a half thick, and\
  \ - being in the small research town of Dubna for a radiation physics research trip\
  \ - I was no stranger to how radio-waves work (or don't work when blocked by a one\
  \ and a half meter thick concrete block). I'll have to do this the age-old way,\
  \ buy using my eyes to see what I'm buying. All of a sudden milk and cream look\
  \ very similar. But \"moloko\" sounds much closer to \"milk\" than \"krem\" or \"\
  iyogurt\", so I carry on doing my shopping - milk, butter, bread, eggs, a four-pack\
  \ of 440ml beer called \"Sibirskaya\" that would later become one of my favorite\
  \ beers. I'm a physicist s Cyrillic reads easier to me because it looks a little\
  \ like Greek with harder lines and edges.\n\nI arrive home, to a small narrow apartment\
  \ covered completely in plywood as if to be an 80's \"mod\" take of a wooden cabin\
  \ - if that cabin were on the ninth floor of a hotel in the small research town\
  \ of Dubna. Lazy to cook an involved meal - no doubt because shopping was so much\
  \ more difficult than I had originally anticipated - I decide to fry an egg while\
  \ I speak to my boyfriend on the phone who is currently living in India. We speak\
  \ as people who are in love speak when they are far away from each other, as I put\
  \ a stick of butter onto a hot pan to fry eggs for a basic egg sandwich. \"My day\
  \ was uneventful, I went to get groceries and...\", the butter starts burning in\
  \ a strange way, as if something more viscous had been infused into it, resulting\
  \ in a lard that will boil in a solid block but not melt. I check the package for\
  \ any expiration dates, and realize that I do not know how to find what I'm looking\
  \ for. I immediately ask my companion to excuse me while I use my phone with more\
  \ attention that I am giving to him during our call, and I face the camera at the\
  \ butter (Google Translate has this feature where you face the camera at any text\
  \ and it translates the text virtually on your screen). \"Slivochnyy syr\", I face\
  \ the camera and \"Cream Cheese\" I get on my screen. I bought cream cheese.\n\n\
  I drop on my bed an hate everything. It's cold and I have a pan with burnt cheese.\
  \ \n\nSome time later, an epiphany befell me. I brought cream cheese because it\
  \ was packaged how butter is in my country, in a gold-colored tinfoil-like wrapper.\
  \ That wasn't the epiphany. The epiphany was that things don't always work how I\
  \ think they do. The world is a large place with different people packaging their\
  \ cheeses with tinfoil and not in cylindrical plastic containers. The epiphany was\
  \ a foreign and beautiful sense of ineffectiveness, that somewhere out there somebody\
  \ packages their cream-cheese differently from how I know it. How much more do they\
  \ do differently?"
