Text: "At the foothill of the spectacular Andes Mountains, my view gazes over a bright\
  \ green sea of leaves. I manage to spot some of the elegant dark grape bunches still\
  \ left on the plants. It is February in Mendoza - harvest season in Argentina\xB4\
  s key wine region. Days are busy at most of the over thousand different wineries\
  \ here. It is time to get dirty hands, time to make one last effort after yet another\
  \ year of resisting nature\xB4s defiance. \n\nAt a prudent distance of this bustling\
  \ activity, a simple swirl of my glass of dark-red wine releases dozens of unique\
  \ scents. Red fruits, vanilla and a touch of French oak pervade my senses - each\
  \ sip being a symphony.  \n\nArgentina\u2019s wine has come a long way. After over\
  \ 400 years of growing grapes for no other purpose than taking communion during\
  \ Sunday service, the country is one of the world\xB4s mayor quality wine producers\
  \ today \u2013 Malbec being the country\xB4s ambassador and surely part of local\
  \ identity. It has a story to tell \u2013 a tale of reality, forever related to\
  \ the nations history.\n\nWhile I enjoy exploring a culturally active, multifaceted\
  \ and unexpectedly green city in 2019, by the end of the 19th century it must have\
  \ been an unmistaken sense of opportunity which let to growing wine in Mendoza:\
  \ a desert where regular earthquakes shake the very foundations and immense temperature\
  \ shifts from day to night with suffocating heat being as possible as iciness, hailstones\
  \ big as golf balls and no more than 250 millilitres of rain per year tempt the\
  \ fate of any winemaker.\n\nWhoever decided to grow wine here first needed passion\
  \ and an unflinching forward thrift as much as an extremely resistant plant \u2013\
  \ a survivor, the superhero of Argentina\xB4s wine tale I am able to enjoy today.\
  \ A century ago, it was immigration that created this ambitious pairing when millions\
  \ of Italians and Spaniards arrived with no more than the dream of building a life\
  \ in the New World, while the French had just given up on Malbec wine, being inadaptable\
  \ to the humid climate in Southern Europe. Three immigrants with nothing to lose\
  \ but the utopia of a new home. \n\nDefying Mendoza\xB4s extreme conditions, dark-red\
  \ liquid was soon running en masse. While Argentina solely produced for the local\
  \ market, people consumed an average 100 litres of wine per person. A seemingly\
  \ never-ending stream of red wine was conducted towards Mendoza\xB4s rail stations\
  \ via Vinoducts \u2013 wine transporting pipes. As bottling was only allowed in\
  \ the capital city Buenos Aires, 1100km farther east, wine trains crossed the country,\
  \ offering similar targets as ancient gold transporters in the wild west. Wine was\
  \ rarefied with ethanol and sugar as people wanted to get hold of their share, unnoticed\
  \ by Mendoza\u2019s winemakers. \n\nContrary to today, by 1980 nobody would gratefully\
  \ accept a bottle of Argentinean wine as quality was manifestly awful. Only blind\
  \ tastings implied a possible turning point for the whole industry and the beginning\
  \ of a new chapter in the story of Malbec. Quality needed to be improved in order\
  \ to survive once again.  And high altitude wines planted up in the Andes Mountains\
  \ were Argentina\xB4s answer to this dilemma. One more time, Malbec wine had to\
  \ bare it\xB4s teeth, adapting to a harsh climate at over 1500 metres - and survive.\
  \ Today, Mendoza\u2019s superhero is offering nothing less than a glorious outcome\
  \ year after year, bottle after bottle. Fighting to adjust to nature\xB4s constant\
  \ defiance, Malbec develops its most unique characteristics, turning each glass\
  \ you share into liquid art: a masterpiece. Make sure you don\u2019t miss the opportunity\
  \ to taste its heritage and listen to its story when visiting Mendoza. Cherish the\
  \ fruity aromas, admire the intense colours and taste the bunch of tannins Argentina\u2019\
  s icon wine is famous for today. You won\xB4t find no other Malbec than this."
