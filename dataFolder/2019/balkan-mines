Text: "After five days driving through Bosnia, in true travel alchemy, our tour guides\
  \ transformed from  strangers to our friends. Two Bosnian men in their mid-thirties,\
  \ high school friends, both with the same name. They solved every travel skirmish\
  \ for the seven of us with equal parts clever solution and laughter. \n\nElectricity\
  \ outage? They barbequed for us by candlelight. \n\nPassports left behind? They\
  \ called friends to coordinate retrievals. \n\nThey were front and center in masterfully\
  \ welding our offbeat explorations, frequent Bosnian coffee breaks, and travel mishaps\
  \ together. \n\nBut this time, they opted to sit outside the factory in Srebenica\
  \ and wait for us. \n\nWe walked silently into the old battery factory turned massacre\
  \ headquarters. The enormous skeletal walls morphed into black and white tributes\
  \ to the 8,373 lives taken within a few days during the summer of 1995.  Testaments\
  \ to the bloody, systematic assault on the former silver mining town of Srebenica.\n\
  \nThe cement building was as heavy as it was empty. \n\nI stood in front of each\
  \ photograph, witnessing the stories of the mostly men and boys herded into genocidal\
  \ traps in what was the deadliest killing spree in Europe since World War II.  A\
  \ science fiction author. Five brothers. A ninety-year-old grandmother, one of the\
  \ few women killed.\n\nInterspersed between the stories were the stains of propaganda,\
  \ some of the puzzle pieces to understand the makings of a killing machine. \n\n\
  \u201CNo teeth\u2026? A moustache\u2026? Smells like shit\u2026? Bosnian girl!\u201D\
  \ \n\nBut the heinous graffiti was a superficial scratch compared to the gashes\
  \ other evidence left behind. Serbs captured their own war crimes on video, leaving\
  \ nothing out of the shots. Recordings revealed a pattern of the most macabre of\
  \ manipulations - forcing those captured to hold the trigger against family and\
  \ friends. Inside the memorial, footage of the final moments of a young boy reveal\
  \ his father forced to call to him from across the field, coaxing him from his hiding\
  \ spot among the trees, leading to both of their deaths.\n \nStepping outside the\
  \ factory, we spotted our guides.\n\nThey were lying in the green field as we walked\
  \ towards them. Past them, small mountains coated in thick forests were nestled\
  \ on either side of the river Drina. We all sat sat quietly in a circle, unsure\
  \ if there was words, in any language, that would fit this moment. Quick calculations\
  \ put them all between the ages of 8-10 during the war. \n\n\u201CIs everyone good?\
  \ Do you need anything?\u201D they asked, never resting from their roles.\n\nWe\
  \ nodded our heads no in consensus. The younger guide, Adnan, stood by an apple\
  \ tree, grabbing apples, shining them softly on his shirt and tossing one to each\
  \ of us. \n\nThey told us it was time to walk across the road to the cemetery. We\
  \ walked together and broke off into pairs.\n\nAs I walked next to Adnan, he graciously\
  \ pushed away his silence and offered his own thoughts, a fitting answer to a question\
  \ I had not asked. \n\n\u201CI was eight  in Sarajevo during the massacres. I knew\
  \ what was happening. We all knew what was happening because they played everything\
  \ on the radio. We thought Sarajevo would be next.\u201D \n\nSarajevo wasn\u2019\
  t next. But after living through a four year siege of Sarajevo, a massacre in his\
  \ own city was an expected next move on the chess board by unfettered war criminals.\n\
  \nThe quick walk was over, we arrived at the gates of the cemetery. Thin, white\
  \ tombstones were packed on to the emerald hills. An open air canopy protected a\
  \ small area serving as a mosque. We each weaved separately through the rows reading\
  \ the names and ages. Every so often an unmarked tombstone surfaced, a reminder\
  \ of those tormented by burials and unburials. Bodies torn out and shuffled from\
  \ one mass grave to another to cover up genocidal accusations.\n \nMy mind spun,\
  \ useless in making sense of senselessness. I reigned in my thoughts and paused\
  \ to look for the others. \n\nI walked towards the small marble floor that rested\
  \ under the shade of the canopy. Stretched on green rugs were a row of people attending\
  \ the small Friday prayer services. Kneeling was Adnan, hands reached up, eyes closed."
