Text: "I just experienced the coldest I've ever been. We just polar plunged into the\
  \ freezing Antarctic sea off the coast of King George Island in Antarctica. An outside\
  \ temperature of two degrees Celsius but feels like minus ten. Water temperature\
  \ is minus two degree Celsius and unlike anything I've ever experienced. Usually,\
  \ when the sea is scattered with icebergs, it's not exactly an invitation to go\
  \ swimming.\nAs I hit the water, there was not a single moment where my body thought\
  \ it was okay to be there. Every cell in my body was thrusting into panic and screaming\
  \ to get out. I scratched my way up the swim steps of the boat as my body seared\
  \ with pain from the shocking cold and raced to the shower on the swim platform\
  \ which was already running hot water. We then proceeded to the sauna inside to\
  \ heat up before getting a warm cup of tea.\nIt was an incredible experience and\
  \ really gives you an appreciation for the severity of the conditions and how we\
  \ should be equipped for survival if anything were to happen. Luckily we have the\
  \ luxury of travelling through this part of the world on a beautiful Super Yacht.\n\
  \nWe arrived here in Antartica on the 2nd of January after spending Christmas in\
  \ Patagonia and New Years rounding the Cape Horn of South America before crossing\
  \ the infamous Drake\u2019s Passage, which is famously known amongst sailors as\
  \ being one of the most treacherous passages in the world. We were very lucky to\
  \ make it across with the sea swell only picking up to two and a half meters. This\
  \ time of year it is said to average approximately six meters and more. It has been\
  \ referred to as the Drake Shake, but also affectionately called Drake Lake, depending\
  \ on a number of different factors. It can either make or break an opportunity to\
  \ reach the other side. \n\nAntarctica is truly an incredible place. It\u2019s a\
  \ completely different world that very few are blessed to experience.\nThe landscape\
  \ is sometimes completely white in all directions with the exception of the sea\
  \ and sometimes the sky but most of the time it all blends together to create a\
  \ deceptive wall that you stare at for ages before you realise what you\u2019re\
  \ looking at. \nThe days can turn from a \u201Cbeautiful\u201D 6 degrees and slightly\
  \ breezy, to below zero and 60 knots of wind. \nIt\u2019s really impressive to witness\
  \ both extremes. It goes to show how spectacular this place is and really gives\
  \ you an appreciation for anything that survives there. \n\nWhen we originally headed\
  \ south, we were blessed with some of the best conditions ever seen by the onboard\
  \ Ice Pilot who accompanied us. Headed North, however, was a slightly more exhilarating\
  \ experience, as we ploughed through 3m swells and scooped water over the bow, Yet\
  \ we made it across to Punta Arenas in Chile where we spent a few days resetting\
  \ ourselves on the South Eastern tip of South America. \nWe were about to embark\
  \ on the single longest passage I've ever been on, and it was particularly special\
  \ as it was taking me across the Ocean to my beloved homeland, South Africa. \n\
  We left on the 6th of February and started our 7000km journey across the South Atlantic\
  \ Ocean. \n\nIt's been 2 years since I joined my floating home and pursued a life\
  \ on the water, travelling around the world to 35 different countries in 24 months,\
  \ driving boats through frozen ice and moving icebergs, to dodging coconuts and\
  \ sipping cocktails on white sandy beaches. \n\nI continue to search the world for\
  \ the end of my adventure, but over the horizon is yet another horizon and I don't\
  \ know where it ends.\nAt this point, a monotonous lifestyle would be damaging to\
  \ my spirit. I simply couldn't survive in one place for too long, So I continue\
  \ to follow the path I\u2019m on, and if or when I reach a crossroads, I will simply\
  \ continue to follow my heart in the direction it leads me."
