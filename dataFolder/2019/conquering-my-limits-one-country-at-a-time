Text: "When I first decided to go to Greece, I was excited but scared. I only knew\
  \ a few phrases, couldn't remember much from history class, didn\u2019t know anyone\
  \ local, and was traveling alone at a time of political discourse. The limits I\
  \ had set in my mind, vanished the moment I got off the plane. Wanderlust had taken\
  \ over and I couldn\u2019t wait to absorb as much of the culture and history as\
  \ possible. I met a group of Brazilians at the airport while in queue for a taxi.\
  \ We were all staying at the same hostel, so we shared an amusing ride trying to\
  \ break language barriers between English, Portuguese, and Greek. We spent the days\
  \ touring the sites, eating fresh seafood, relaxing on the beach, and nights on\
  \ the rooftop bar watching the sun set on the Parthenon. We met wonderful locals,\
  \ and only got lost a few times; which led to discovering beautiful gardens in Athens.\
  \ Learning about the history and local lore (like that of Athena and turtles) made\
  \ me feel child-like excitement I didn\u2019t know was missing from my life. The\
  \ owner of our hostel also invited us to a barbeque. There were Greeks, Brazilians,\
  \ Australians, Persians, and me- the American. No one cared about cultural differences;\
  \ only in learning about that culture. I will never forget that bonding experience.\
  \  The Brazilians and I kept in touch over the years and when one of their friends\
  \ came to the states, I had the pleasure of meeting him. When he found out I travel\
  \ to France often, he introduced me to his friend who moved to Portugal from Brazil.\
  \ I never knew pushing myself out of my comfort zone by traveling alone to a new\
  \ country, would lead to life long friends all over the world and the love of my\
  \ life. Now I have someone that loves traveling with me, and it has shown me that\
  \ humans are all connected by love, wonder and desire."
