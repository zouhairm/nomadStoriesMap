Text: "Until November of 2018, the only thing I\u2019ve heard about Malta was an old\
  \ video from Youtube entitled \u201CThe Italian man who went to Malta\u201D(which\
  \ actually says nothing about Malta, it just make fun of Italians accent). In December,\
  \ I was thinking in study English in San Francisco, but, then, the exchange agency\
  \ teaches me about Malta geography and sightseeings and, by the end, convinced me\
  \ to choose Malta with 2 arguments: \u201CIt was the place where was recorded Game\
  \ of Thrones\u201D and \u201Cit\u2019s the cheapest choice for an exchange\u201D\
  \nSo, in January of 2019 my adventure began. In my first day in Malta, I notice\
  \ that I was is in a place full of history and culture that hosts many tourists\
  \ from every corner of the planet, bus drivers can be very rude, and Italians have\
  \ indeed a funny accent (and it\u2019s adorable). But, my favorite story to tell\
  \ about this trip is my \u201CI\u2019m going to die today\u201D experience, which\
  \ happened on my second day.\nEarly morning, I went alone at the Ross station to\
  \ take my first bus to Ghar Dalam cave and museum. It was a cloudy day, but also\
  \ seemed the sun could appear any moment. One hour later, I was at the entrance\
  \ of the museum. I opened a door and could see all kind of archeological things:\
  \ bones, ceramics and fossils. Few steps away was the beautiful, exotical and important\
  \ Ghar Dalam: the cave, dated from 7.400 years ago, containing fossil bones of dwarf,\
  \ elephants, birds and etc. Beyond the cave, a fence leads to a big garden, with\
  \ many trees and rocks where supposed it would be two caves more to explore. There\
  \ were no signs and no person around, but, it feels safe, so I leap into the unknown\
  \ garden. After 40 minutes climbing the rocks and walking, I couldn\u2019t see the\
  \ way back to the museum anymore. I\u2019ve started to go round and round in circles\
  \ and, to increase my despair: it starts to rain. About one hour later walking and\
  \ dropping on the very smooth rocks about a hundred times, I sat on the ground,\
  \ completely dirty, exhausted and with tears in my face mixing with the rain that\
  \ was falling.  I hugged a rock nearby me and think: \u201CSo, this is it! This\
  \ is how I die: lost in the trees, in a foreign country!\u201D while I was laying\
  \ down to rest, with the rock I was talking to, I heard a woman voice yelling \u201C\
  Heyyy! Are you lost?\u201D I jumped and reply to her \u201CYes! I\u2019m lost! Please,\
  \ help me?\u201D\nLong story short: Somehow, she saw me into the garden and helps\
  \ me out and I made to be in time for my afternoon class as a reborn woman.\nGeografically,\
  \ Malta is the smallest country of  European Union, and it\u2019s not actually an\
  \ island; it is an archipelago formed by three islands: Malta, Gozo and Comino connected\
  \ by the Mediterranean sea. Personally, it is much more than that.You can feel this\
  \  walking by the beige streets of Mdina, where every corner you turn, it seems\
  \ like a viking army it will appear any moment, also, when you look at the megalithic\
  \ temples, dated as being from the Bronze Age and realized how little is the place\
  \ you occupy in the space and time, or, when you stare at the Mediterranean sea\
  \ and their many shades of blue, listening the peaceful and brutal sound of the\
  \ waves and letting your soul and spirit fly into the mystic and even when you get\
  \ lost in a garden underneath the rain\u2026 \nIt occurs to me that we are a little\
  \ bit like Malta: a kind of small and isolated on the surface but connected in the\
  \ deep.\nIt\u2019s been a month since I came back to my hometown and when people\
  \ ask me about the travel and the exchange I tell about Ghar Dalam and advice them\
  \ to enjoy every moment, every second of thatkind of experience. Because in the\
  \ end, we only realize how beautiful and amazing it was when we came home and rest\
  \ the head in that old and familiar pillow."
