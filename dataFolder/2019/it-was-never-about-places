Text: "I would bet that if you ask anyone what their ideal life would be, they will\
  \ answer: \"traveling.\" The ideal life of any person is to live traveling, to know\
  \ the world, to know what is out there, I am sure.\n\nI know because I always wanted\
  \ to leave this small neighborhood and see what other places were like. And everyone\
  \ I know - in and out of this place - they think exactly the same. And it is not\
  \ for less, the world has too much to offer, and it seems to take more than one\
  \ life to see everything.\n\nSo after 32 years locked in my impossibilities, I jumped\
  \ on my first trip. And destination was not the subject of discussion: BRAZIL. That\
  \ was the moment when my little posibility mattered the most, it was now or never.\n\
  \nSo there we went, in a group and no planes: traveling the earth, seeing the landscapes,\
  \ the people, the life. I do not know if my small city is too grey, or if the colors\
  \ in Brazil shine more.\nI think that is the last option.\n\nMaybe I was so eager\
  \ to see the world that my eyes were more open, and I saw everything much better.\n\
  \nHas something like this happened to you? Then returning home is like waking up\
  \ from a beautiful dream and reality does not compare. I was very lclose of literally\
  \ go up in a palm tree and refusing to return.\n\nWell, I couldn't be all the time\
  \ I wanted in the seaside resort of Cambori\xFA. And those days were not enough\
  \ time to travel around other cities and know everything possible. The colors continued\
  \ to amaze me and the songs of the Brazilians speaking Portuguese and the habits\
  \ of the people were added. The care of the environment, the conscience of respect\
  \ for the other. Discovering a new culture is always an incentive. The people are\
  \ wonderful, predisposed, helpful, warm.\n\nBut it was never about places.\n\nAs\
  \ I knew more beaches, and better restaurants; as I tried things I had never seen\
  \ (Caipirinha and Feijoada were just the beginning) and took risks I would not take\
  \ at home, as i talked to more and more people from different places ... I realized.\n\
  \nWe do not travel to know places.\n\nWe do not travel to know cultures and new\
  \ people. All that is great, of course, and it is an additional gain that enriches\
  \ us and - many times - changes our perspective.\n\nBut it's not about that. It\
  \ was never about that.\n\nWe travel to know ourselves. It is the biggest challenge:\
  \ to put ourselves in an unknown place and to get the best out of ourselves. Discover\
  \ that we prefer the sea to the mountains, or the sun to the snow. Encourage us\
  \ to climb a hill or throw ourselves on a zip line. Learn from other people and\
  \ take that to our very own places.\n\nPush us towards new things. Forcing us to\
  \ know other colors within us, forcing us to open our eyes more.\nIt's not that\
  \ much about places. It's about you."
