Text: "We\u2019re gathered around a table in the tiny dining nook of a one-bedroom\
  \ apartment in Los Angeles, around the corner from every other film set you can\
  \ name (or where, if they didn\u2019t film there, someone was sure to have penned\
  \ some screenplay). The room is filled with different languages, cooking clatter,\
  \ catching up, wine pouring, bustling over hot pots in the tiny kitchen. As steaming\
  \ dishes appear on the table, requisite introductions begin. \n\nFADE-IN:\nINT.\
  \ APARTMENT -  NIGHT \n\nGUEST 1\n(Pouring out red wine into assorted cups and mugs)\n\
  How do you know Heeny?\n\nGUEST 2 \nI know Heeny from Couchsurfing, I was her Couchsurfer\
  \ five years ago when I was backpacking from Indonesia\u2026\n\nHEENY\nAfter I made\
  \ bibimbap for her she loved it.\n\nGUEST 2\nI still do!\n\nME\nShe always makes\
  \ me kimchi jiggae now because once I slept at her place and she made me breakfast\
  \ and I was never the same.\n\nHEENY\n(Laughing) \nRebecca loves her spicy soup.\n\
  \nGUEST 3 \nI know Heeny through Amy. We met at a Couchsurfing meetup three years\
  \ ago when we both moved to LA\u2026\n\nHEENY\nAmy loves to go clubbing.\n\nAMY\n\
  It was for coffee!\n\nGUEST 4\nI know Heeny\u2019s boyfriend Egan through a Couchsurfing\
  \ meetup in Czech seven years ago\u2026\n\nGUEST 2 \nHow do YOU know Heeny?\n\n\
  HEENY and I pause in reflection. \n\nI drift out of my internal screenplay and realize\
  \ I haven\u2019t thought about this in a long time. \n\nHeeny\u2019s been a steadfast\
  \ older sister - nuna - for 10 years now, originating when I was newly graduated\
  \ from university, teaching English in South Korea. I\u2019ve stayed at her place\
  \ many times. Always, she cooks me kimchi jiggae for breakfast and always we drink\
  \ too much red wine. Now she visits me in LA and still we drink too much red wine\
  \ but we taste-test all the taco trucks. \n\nHEENY \n(Pouring her Belgian boyfriend\
  \ a glass of red wine) \nWe know each other through Marika\u2026\n\nConversation\
  \ sidetracks as EGAN and GUEST 4 chat in French, and Heeny interrupts them in English\
  \ to interpret for the rest of us that GUEST 4 is a poker player who literally does\
  \ not have an apartment but rather rents and Couchsurfs his way across the world\
  \ for his career. Exclamation and overtaking ensues momentarily.\n\nMarika, an Australian\
  \ wonder-woman who practically became fluent in Korean just, it seemed, so she could\
  \ chat up the Korean cab drivers.\n\nME:\nI met Marika through Ily! Heeny, you remember\
  \ Ily?\n\nHEENY:\nOf course!\n\nIly, a delightful woman from Mexico who now lives\
  \ in Salt Lake City with her husband and darling baby. \n\nME: \nRemember when we\
  \ hosted that World Cup party to watch the Mexico game at your old apartment and\
  \ the only Mexican beer we could find in Lotte Mart was Corona - in MINI bottles?\
  \ I think Pierre must have drunk a dozen. Oh Pierre, how is he?\n\nThe conversation\
  \ scatters as AMY scuttles to the kitchen and retrieves a giant box of cream pastries\
  \ GUEST 2 has brought from LA\u2019s Koreatown.\n\nI met Ily when I moved to Korea,\
  \ the summer of \u201909. My college friend Mari and I met up at a Latin America\
  \ fest in Seoul and ate flour-tortilla tacos and salsa danced in the square. When\
  \ we ducked into a local hotel to use the bathroom, we heard Ily speaking Spanish.\
  \ Mari popped out of a stall and immediately struck up a lively conversation which\
  \ resulted in hugs before we even left the room and ended in competitively eating\
  \ flour-tortilla burritos in front of the crowd (Ily\u2019s husband won). \n\nNow,\
  \ new friends and some reunited ones splashing wine, swapping travel tales, fumbling\
  \ with chopsticks of Heeny\u2019s homemade glass noodles and cooling our tongues\
  \ on an oh-so-American veggie tray with ranch dressing in between bites unexpectedly\
  \ felt more like home than anywhere I\u2019d been.\n\nI\u2019ve come to truly love\
  \ Los Angeles for its thriving multiculturalism. It\u2019s also a common hub for\
  \ travelers, which means I never have to say goodbye, only \u201Csee you soon.\u201D\
  \ These friendships are the very best kind, and they always make me feel more grateful,\
  \ more curious, and more itchy to hit the road."
