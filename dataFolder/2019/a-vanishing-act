Text: "Island of genies. Host to the dragon blood trees. Home to the world's greatest\
  \ sorcerers. \n\nSocotra.\n\nA place that enchanted me long before I set foot on\
  \ it. Socotra embodies all our greatest oriental fantasies: shepherds who recite\
  \ ancient Aramaic poetry in the dead of night and mix Islam with magic on jagged\
  \ peaks. I knew enough not to carry these fantasies to dearly, but like I suspect\
  \ many of us do, I wanted to know if Sinbad's world could remain amid the throes\
  \ of modernity and international proxy warfare.\n\nAt the time, the only way to\
  \ Socotra was via Mukalla, a coastal Yemeni city, during American assassinations\
  \ of suspected Al-Qaeda operatives, and several people tried to stop me from going\
  \ so I wouldn't be killed or kidnapped. They had their biases of looming, I had\
  \ mine of immanent magic. I assured them that Socotra was different from the mainland:\
  \ safe, removed, apolitical. But I didn't know or care. I wanted to see sorcery.\n\
  \nAfter landing in Hadibu and finding a room in its only hotel - the Taj Socotra\
  \ - I was told I would need to hire a local guide. Gallivanting fantasies dashed.\
  \ No problem, my guide would be a local shepherd, not a Yemeni tourism professional.\
  \ After some negotiation over prices, I agreed to meet Ahmed the next morning, and\
  \ armed myself with cans of olives, slices of cheese, and dates, saving just enough\
  \ cash to cover Ahmed's fees. I had spent nearly all my savings just to get to Socotra,\
  \ and reasoned I wouldn't need that much money on a magic island anyway.\n\nHe showed\
  \ up the next day, maybe five feet tall, with bare feet like rhino skin, and wearing\
  \ the kilt-like dress of Yemen, the futa. I was wearing jeans and Vibram five-toe\
  \ shoes - the dress of my people - so we gave each other the once over, nodded,\
  \ and set off to summit the jagged Skand mountains, pushing each other like men\
  \ do who wish to see what this new stranger is made of. \n\nAhmed was pretty fast\
  \ over rocks, but I think he expected me to beg for a rest at that pace. Once we\
  \ broke over the clouds by midday, he nearly had to force me to take a break. So\
  \ we had a photo-shoot. He took pictures of me, and I took pictures of him. He wanted\
  \ his portrait with only blue sky in the background, I wanted the whole landscape\
  \ behind me. \n\nThe next morning, we picked our way through endless rolling pastures,\
  \ resting in caves, chewing qat, fighting off ornery vultures, speaking without\
  \ talking, meeting other shepherds. I was blissed out knowing I could not be consumed\
  \ by modernity out here. I'd heard talk in Hadibu of Qataris buying out the Socotran\
  \ property to build huge resorts. I'd heard talk of separatism, of war. That could\
  \ not touch us here. \n \nI would have told Ahmed how much I appreciated him for\
  \ this, but he and I knew the same amount of Arabic; which is to say, five words\
  \ apiece. Most of our communication was based on gestures and assumptions. That\
  \ night Ahmed asked to be payed; I wish I spoke Socotri then. \nI gave him my last\
  \ cash assuming this was his full rate. He wanted more; this was just the daily\
  \ rate. I had no more cash, showed him this fact, and he was suddenly no longer\
  \ my friend. Ahmed was pissed off. I was slightly panicked. I could pay him later,\
  \ but I had no way of telling him this decisively. Yet I refused to turn back after\
  \ coming so far, and I had no way of telling him this either.\n\nSo when he went\
  \ to sleep, I made my move. Do as Sinbad would do. Escape into the dragon blood\
  \ forest just as dawn trickles into the night. Drink the olive water so you don't\
  \ die quickly. Follow goat paths to the canyon bottom. Drink. \n\nMany days later\
  \ when I wound up back in Hadibu, I did get the money to Ahmed. I had been foolish\
  \ and selfish, but I had also been brave and lucky, and clever and strong. That\
  \ is Socotra. I hope it will remain."
