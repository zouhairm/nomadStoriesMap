Text: "Hometown is a place that you belongs to. We will feel nice and happy when we\
  \ are there. But sometimes we do not want to explore other area than the area we\
  \ already know. It all started with my curiosity. My family and I decided to visit\
  \ the cities of Banyuwangi and Jember. Usually we only live in the village where\
  \ my father grew up. Because we want to try some special foods and some fruits that\
  \ are only in Banyuwangi. Rujak soto and Durian Merah. Rujak soto is a good combination\
  \ of food and it taste so good. Durian merah, durian is an exotic fruit. A lot of\
  \ people do not like this fruit because of the aroma of this fruit. But my family\
  \ and I are fans of this fruit. We love to eat, so we decided to get eat some. It\
  \ taste incredible and different from another durian. There are a lot of type of\
  \ durian. Bur durian merah only can found in Banyuwangi. Not only eat the fruit,\
  \ we also visit where the durian tree grows. The tree of this durian is so cool.\
  \ The trunk is split into two, the first and second trunk have different durian\
  \ types. I never expect I will see that tree. After that we decided to go home in\
  \ Kediri, it took 9-10 hours from Banyuwangi. But, when we touch down in Jember\
  \ we decided to find and eat another durian. When we try to find durian, we find\
  \ something unique. A lot of kind dragon fruit. All this time I only thought that\
  \ dragon fruit only has two types, red flesh and white flesh with red skin. I see\
  \ a cute little dragon fruit with yellow skin and white flesh and I thought that\
  \ was unripe dragon fruit, but it was ripe and taste so good. And a lot more dragon\
  \ fruit there. Banyuwangi and Jember is my hometown that I always visit every year.\
  \ But, I never expect to found a lot of exotic fruit there and I never expect that\
  \ the place that I always visit has another side that I never know. That\u2019s\
  \ make me always want to explore more and more and I wish I can explore whole world\
  \ and can share the story to you. The unique food, unique culture and other unique\
  \ thing that we don\u2019t really know that they are exist."
