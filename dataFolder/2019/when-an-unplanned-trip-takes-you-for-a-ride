Text: "I wanted something new in life and got bored by the humdrum of daily life.\
  \ So I was looking for an excuse to travel and there it was. I was to give an exam\
  \ in my neighboring state Odisha for a job and it was the perfect opportunity for\
  \ me to get excited. I was to travel with a friend who is a bit crazy or maybe a\
  \ bit more crazy than me. I ran from here to there just to sign all those forms\
  \ for the exam and then the day came.\n\nFrom the moment me and my friend boarded\
  \ we knew it would be an exciting journey for us and it didn't disappoint. He was\
  \ smoking in the train while putting his feet down on the steps of the train, being\
  \ fully aware smoking is a punishable offence in train. Soon an older guy from a\
  \ nearby compartment came and asked for light to which he shared. My friend finished\
  \ his smoke and the moment the guy started to smoke he was caught by a policeman\
  \ dressed in plain clothes. The train was going at full speed between the fields\
  \ of paddy and rice, and me and my friend just exchanged a smirk.\n\nWe reached\
  \ a cousin's home of mine (whom I did not know existed until my father told me about\
  \ him before the trip), and then after having dinner we were ready to visit the\
  \ Zoo. I took out my shoes and lo and behold a fully formed adult frog jumped out\
  \ of it. My friend didn't miss the opportunity and took the shot for endless trolls\
  \ later. It was a new territory for us but at night we were smoking on the open\
  \ field of the railway quarters. It was silent all around with occasional barking\
  \ and a floodlight that is trying its best to light the field.\n\nFrom the next\
  \ day the moment our exam finished, we made plans on the fly. We took an auto (called\
  \ tuktuk - a 3 wheeler vehicle which runs on motor) in some places) and went to\
  \ a nearby temple. It was an ancient temple and we have to go barefoot, I got entry\
  \ but my friend was asked if he was Muslim because he had these long beards (FYI,\
  \ only Hindus were allowed in that temple). Regardless, he was allowed entry and\
  \ we get to see the temple in its whole glory. Most of the structures were hundreds\
  \ of year old, mostly made up of rocks and were deep reddish in color. \n\nFrom\
  \ there we visited the Nalanda zoo where I get to see the variety of species of\
  \ birds and animals. Our final stop was the Buddha stupa, where the white Buddha\
  \ statue made up of while marble with different stages of his enlightenment in process\
  \ were carved on it.\nThe next day we woke up early and took a bus to Puri. While\
  \ on the bus I felt a different sense of freedom. We reached there at last after\
  \ 2.5 hrs and we checked into a guesthouse. Needless to say the guesthouse was a\
  \ contact of my companion and so the checkin was pretty smooth. \nThe next day we\
  \ went to the beach and boy, we made some pretty silly mistakes. The current in\
  \ the Bay of Bengal was quite strong and over that I carried a big towel and we\
  \ both had glasses on. While we were having fun in the water in the sweltering heat\
  \ of May, my friend suddenly got knocked down by a big wave and then he got back\
  \ up he had already lost his spectacles. The situation was so hilarious that I was\
  \ laughing hard, and as Karma has it I too was knocked down by a similar wave and\
  \ when I got back up, behold my glasses are gone. Now I was panicking and searching\
  \ for it frantically. My friend suddenly announced that something was stuck in his\
  \ feet and when he picked it up, bravo it was my spectacle.\n\nThe trip was full\
  \ of adventure and fun for me, but more than that it was the spontaneous decision\
  \ to go somewhere else leaving the comfort of my home."
