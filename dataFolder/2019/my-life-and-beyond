Text: Once upon a time there was a.little girl in the country of portugal...who once
  knew who she was..Throughout life...she sought out people to help.with answers she
  had questions too...she never really got the answers she was.looking for..She searched...she.looked...she
  asked...she prayed..still no.matter what people told her..she still doubted and
  had a hard time believing ...at.times..she even felt it was either.too good to be
  true..or she didn't think she could do what was told to her about her life and destiny..
  from.the very beginning . At times it was even hard to overcome people's accusations
  and bad views of her ..or what she thought other people were.saying of her at the
  time...it hurt and it bothered her alot...but all she could do at times was cry
  and pray ...she later on in life came to the realization  that you can't pray and
  worry at the same time...so.she would put her trust...strength  and courage into
  her words and prayers for others...but she also knew that "Hey I also need prayer
  for myself..so I can build up others in my most holy Faith in God..as I began to
  Pray ..God opened up my eyes to see what I needed to see so i.could.see.prayers
  answered..he began to show me answers to my prayers, and he even gave me dreams
  and visions..and also the needs of.others.and I would quickly respond to them the
  best way that I could...
