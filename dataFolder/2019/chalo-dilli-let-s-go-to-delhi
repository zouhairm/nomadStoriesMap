Text: "We had no photos together.\n\nI pointed this out laughingly after we met up\
  \ at Old Delhi Railway station.We were seeing each other for the first time in four\
  \ years.\nKetan, Anmol and I had been friends since we were all awkward and acne-prone\
  \ 9th graders. The last time I saw them,we were hugging each other goodbye in front\
  \ of our old school in Chandigarh,Punjab.Despite staying in touch after my family\
  \ had shifted to New Delhi,we never met again.\nUntil today.\n\u201CWe\u2019re coming\
  \ to see you next Saturday! Show us around your city\u201D,they had cheerfully texted\
  \ me last week.\n\nIt was my idea to visit Old Delhi. Built by the Mughal emperor\
  \ of India Shah Jahan in the 17th century,the ancient walled city of Dilli (Old\
  \ Delhi) is a throwback to the medieval history of India. New Delhi, where I lived,\
  \ was the modern half of the city constructed in the early 20th century as the new\
  \ capital of the British Raj. Old Delhi however, was composed of sprawling shops\
  \ selling everything from whole spices to precious silver.This chaotic and crumbling\
  \ city had preserved the gritty spirit of Delhi for well over three centuries.\n\
  \nOr so I\u2019d heard. I had never been to Old Delhi in my life. I was born in\
  \ East Delhi, had completed my schooling in South Delhi, and currently lived in\
  \ West Delhi,where I also attended college. Somehow I had never set foot in North\
  \ Delhi - Old Delhi.\n\nSo I winged it, and prayed that the boys couldn\u2019t tell\
  \ if we got lost a few times in the winding lanes as I gave them the grand tour.\
  \ We spent the entire day discovering the city on foot. From the towering Red Fort\
  \ to the narrow and decrepit lanes of Mirza Ghalib\u2019s haveli (mansion), we saw\
  \ it all.Drinking tall glasses of cold and sweet lassi (buttermilk) by the roadside\
  \ stalls,we managed to retell old stories above the sound of Delhi\u2019s blaring\
  \ traffic. Every lane we walked down opened a new direction in our conversations\
  \ as well.\nAnmol made it a point to document our first meeting by taking photos\
  \ of us on his brand new iphone. I had always been very camera-conscious,but in\
  \ the arms of old friends I felt that reserve melt away under the afternoon sun.\n\
  \u201CEww Sanjukta! Don\u2019t kiss the goats.\u201D,choked Anmol over his shoulder.\u201D\
  But he\u2019s so cute\u201D,I cooed,patting the downy head of the baby goat.\u201D\
  Why are they tied to the pillars in the street?\u201D.\n\u201DYour little friend\
  \ \u201D,remarked Ketan deadpan,\u201D is destined to become biryani next month.They\u2019\
  re fattening up the goats for Eid. Look.\u201D,he pointed to the menu board hung\
  \ outside Karim\u2019s mughlai restaurant.We were going there for lunch.My face\
  \ froze in horror,and Anmol made sure to capture that expression on camera.\n\n\
  Our last stop for the day was the Jama Masjid. The azaan ( muslim call for prayer)\
  \ resounded clearly inside the red-sandstone and white marble compound of the mosque.\
  \ Suddenly it struck me : today was the first day I had voluntarily spent in Delhi.\n\
  \nOver the last 19 years of my existence,I had moved in and out of the city several\
  \ times but I had no real attachment to it.My father worked as a sales manager and\
  \ he was usually transferred to supervise a different part of the country every\
  \ two years or so.I had left behind more cities,houses,schools and friendships than\
  \ I dared to count.\nWhen had I inadvertently decided that I would never put down\
  \ roots again?\nLooking at my friends goofy faces with shock, I realised that I\
  \ may have set out to show them my city, but the truth was that today I had seen\
  \ Delhi for the first time. I had seen it without the prejudice of wishing to be\
  \ somewhere else with someone else doing something else entirely.\n\nToday this\
  \ city finally felt like home.\n\nWith shaky laughter I took out my phone, and clicked\
  \ the last photo of us for the day."
