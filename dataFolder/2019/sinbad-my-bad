Text: "The day I met Sinbad was a wet, muddy, grey one.  The sheet of clouds hung\
  \ too low and the rain too heavy to foster a safe landing.  So Haley cancelled the\
  \ plane that was meant to arrive today that was meant to transport the pin-tail\
  \ feathers from three kakapo we were meant to catch to a lab on the main land. \
  \ The newly formed feathers harbor a reservoir of pulpy, congealed blood and genetic\
  \ material that, once plucked, can be harvested and frozen in a lab awaiting future\
  \ research, tests, and scientific findings.  \n\nToday was meant to be the day for\
  \ said tail feather extraction, which would have had us locating the selected birds\
  \ via telemetry, but the weather held different plans.  So I, resuming my original\
  \ feed out route, plod on through the mud, the rain drumming absentmindedly on each\
  \ covering leaf all the while.  \n\nAs I trod on I spy, just poking up from the\
  \ duff, a mottled green kakapo feather. As I bend to retrieve it I hear a noise\
  \ familiar by description but virgin to my ears.  A low, almost too low to actually\
  \ hear, breathy but guttural BOOM BOOM BOOM. Feeling it more than hearing, like\
  \ the deep bass of the car behind you at the stop light. The infamous BOOMING mating\
  \ call of the male kakapo!  And by the sound of it, this one is close! A bit disappointed\
  \ in missing this morning\u2019s scheduled opportunity to see a live kakapo, I reckon\
  \ this intimate auditory moment with a not far off kakapo fella more than makes\
  \ up for it.\n\nBut wait, just there, did something move? Shyly creeping out of\
  \ the thin ground cover, one long toed foot deliberately after the other, eying\
  \ me skeptically.  He freezes, then ducks under a tussock lump, instantly vanishing\
  \ like a professional magician thanks to his expertly crafted mossy green coat.\
  \  As he peers out at me I glimpse the fine, soft whiskers decorating his yellow,\
  \ owl-like face.  A massive, curved, vein-blue beak is his only giveaway.\n\nCounting\
  \ every one of my lucky stars for this precious encounter with this robust gentle\
  \ giant, I grab my pack and move on to the next feeding station.  But he hasn\u2019\
  t gotten what he came for.  Unknowingly I have accepted his booming coital invitation\
  \ and Mr. Kakapo has only just begun his quest.  \n\nThe moment my pack touches\
  \ the ground he is off like a bat out of hell, like a bullet from a gun.  Out of\
  \ the bush and no longer a coy flirt, but a green stealth bomber on a mission of\
  \ procreation.  His target: yours truly.\n\nI\u2019m sprinting full speed down the\
  \ thin, winding track, Kakapo Romeo hot on my heels.  His strong beak manages to\
  \ grab a gaiter edge, and for a stride or two he rides my leg like a stunt double\
  \ on a wild stallion.  Finally I manage to lose the shockingly fast day-breaking\
  \ night parrot.  Thinking he lost his lady fair, I imagine him sulking back to his\
  \ booming bowl, heart sick and balls as blue as his beak. \n \nBut wait, my pack!\
  \  He thinks of it just as I do because as I sneakily double back with hopes of\
  \ rescuing it I see him perched triumphantly atop my human scented lump of fabric.\
  \  And he\u2019s doing a victory dance!  Or is it a slightly more salacious one?\
  \  It doesn\u2019t matter because all dancing halts as soon as I round the corner\
  \ and he\u2019s sprinting towards me head held purposefully low, feet powering him\
  \ forward like a steam engine with no shortage on steam.  Once again I high tail\
  \ it out of there and luckily I have enough gain on this unlikely track star to\
  \ leave him behind long enough for him to finally take the hint and slink off into\
  \ the bush. I mutter, \"No Means NO Mr. Kakapo\" and leave my poor love starved\
  \ fine feathered (almost more than a) friend behind for good."
