Text: "Rewind six months, I was in the driving seat of my life. Jumping straight onto\
  \ my career path after university, travel had to take a backseat. In London working\
  \ my dream job. It was time for a break- tiredness can kill. \nCraving the same\
  \ phenomenal experiences as on our European road-trip, my girlfriend and I were\
  \ on the verge of booking a trip to Iceland.\nThen everything shattered. October\
  \ 16th, my twin sister died in a road accident. Losing Lucy stopped my engine, Iceland\
  \ didn't fuel me anymore; the world wasn't a place I wanted to see. I fully broke\
  \ down in January, I wasn't designed for this cold weather. \nIn February, summer\
  \ came to London. Sunlight ignited something inside me, moving again, I still wasn't\
  \ driving. Travel tapped my shoulder from the backseat- \"let me take the wheel\"\
  . It made sense, so I moved over.\nBudget flights were the first stop. Fez, Morocco\
  \ for \xA330? Indicate. Screeching \"you shouldn't go where people think you are\
  \ devils and deserve to die\" my girlfriend\u2019s mum forced an emergency stop.\
  \ Asking my parents for guidance, we discussed the right way to behave and shifted\
  \ up a gear. My girlfriend's handbrake was on- \"I can't go, so there's no point\
  \ discussing it\". \nI'd already burnt funds and my tank was full for the first\
  \ time in a while. The crash broke us up. Losing her flung off course, but you can't\
  \ be lost without somewhere to go. I opened the door to my friend James, put my\
  \ foot down and we sped into the unknown. \nWe arrived in Fez after sunset, and\
  \ because the Medina is notoriously hard to navigate, organised a direct transfer\
  \ to our Riad. \nI woke early, fumes of anxious excitement oozing from me; not wanting\
  \ to wake James- I scanned around. A knife on the wall pointed at the bedroom door,\
  \ I obeyed. Socks sliding; I followed the mosaic staircase down  into the Riad's\
  \ communal area. Decorative sofas welcomed me, the firm cushions directed my gaze\
  \ at a traditional Fassi outfit pinned to the opposing wall. I likened the hooded\
  \ garment to a less flashy version of what I'd seen worn inside Vatican City. The\
  \ analogy made things different, but more familiar.\nI text my friend. The closest\
  \ Muslim to me, I had told her the collision between my sexuality and Moroccan culture.\
  \ She brushed this off, but did worry being white would make me a target. She thoughtfully\
  \ organised, with Morrocan friends, a contact for me in country. The contact's name\
  \ was \"Lamiae, but say it Lam-e-ya\" Having realised O2 didn\u2019t cover Morocco,\
  \ Lamiae volunteered to show us where to buy a sim at midday of our first day. Her\
  \ kindness moved me. \nI overheard English; \u2018Roof terrace\u2019. I followed\
  \ the voices to glimpse my first look at the stunning city. A mosaic of rooftops.\
  \ The air felt warm, traditional but intellectual; I took a deep breath and tasted\
  \ life. \nI felt awake, my stomach too. Instinctively I found the kitchen. I explained\
  \ James wasn't awake but I wanted food. Back upstairs- James was up 'breakfast in\
  \ 15\" be ready.\nAfter dates and mint tea came croissants, cake and bread plus\
  \ \u2018M\u2019semen\u2019, a traditional pancake which combined all three.\nAt\
  \ Midday, we parked ourselves against the wall outside. Two women approached, wearing\
  \ colourful hijabs. \u201CAnna?\u201D \u201CHi, are you Lam-e-ya?\u201D She nodded\
  \ and gave a kiss on either cheek. \nLamiae took us to the sim shop. \u201CI can\
  \ drive us to Meknes- another medieval city, or to Ifrane- a skiing town\". A ski\
  \ resort in Morocco? That needed to be seen. Adventure beckoning, I was energised\
  \ by their kindness.\nWalking to the car, a man was struggling to push a cart. Instantly\
  \ both sisters were pushing.\nWe chased the Middle Atlas toward Ifrane. Stopping\
  \ at a roadside restaurant, without a menu, we were confused what to ask for. Soda\
  \ was a safe bet. I took a while to pour, my delay caught Lamiae's attention. \"\
  Bepsi\" she said, pointing to the arabic translation of brand name, \"there\u2019\
  s no P in the alphabet, so we have to use B\". I felt grateful our shared tastes\
  \ allowed me to learn more information."
