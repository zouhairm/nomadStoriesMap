Text: "Woke up this morning late, and since I am on holiday I decided to linger in\
  \ bed for a little longer, with my eyes shut, I started to reflect at 2017, the\
  \ places I've been to, the people I met, all those dreams which are now a reality\
  \ of the past. \nMy mind quickly took me back to two places which awaken so much\
  \ curiosity and interest in my brain : Marrakesh and Istanbul. Two places full of\
  \ contrast yet with so much in common. The first, is mystical and warm the second\
  \ is grand and intimidating. Both places are bursting with culture. A culture that\
  \ took thousands and thousands of years to build. I remember the short journey from\
  \ Menara Airport to our Riad. This Moroccan young man, picked us up. He was skinny,\
  \ wearing a black leather jacket and black sunglasses, his hair was combed backwards\
  \ and, had too much gel in it, so much that its natural curls were very well defined\
  \ . He clearly had the allure, possibly even the reputation of a respected gigolo.\
  \ \nOnce in the taxi, he started making small talk with us, and with hypnotising\
  \ Arabic music playing in the background although I was listening to him, I was\
  \ hugely distracted by the white peaks of Atlas Mountains I could see far from the\
  \ taxi window. \nAnd here I am, with the help of my mind at Spice Bazaar, in Istanbul\
  \ buying tea from Dimitri. He invited us into his shop, trying to introduce us to\
  \ all his merchandise as any merchant would do, with the hope that we would make\
  \ a substantial purchase. I was more interested in his origins so I ask 'How is\
  \ it that your name is Dimitri, this is not a Turkish name?' He tells me, his mother\
  \ is Greek. As I am easily distracted, I was quickly drawn to some dry red rose\
  \ buds I see in his shop . He tells me this is 'love tea' I said, I have a kilo\
  \ of that please? We both bursted in laughter. \nBack in England.... to be continued\
  \ ."
