Text: "Sketching the World: A scratch from the small Island\n\nWhen the scratch starts\
  \ from your book, then I begin to start the story from what I witness. The colorful\
  \ things that happens in the journey. From each spot of the place, from each site\
  \ of the street where we pass. From each highest peak that we imagine. From the\
  \ deepest place beyond the hole. A scratch from the lines, it is where the adventure\
  \ begins, not only from the picture but also from what we see.\nStarting from the\
  \ Archipelago\n\nThis starts from my archipelago, a country with thousands of islands.\
  \ Where you will need more than hundred thousand stop point to discover each of\
  \ its space. As this country has more than seventeen thousand islands separated.\
  \ And how we can imagine, how many hidden gems inside of it. From this strong motif\
  \ to discover all of it, and sketch all its spots, also makes this head to do other\
  \ exploration also around the world.\n\nThis is Indonesia, my home country that\
  \ has motivate me to make many sketches beside the pictures that we take. Starting\
  \ from city to city, Village to village, Island to islands, mountain to maintain.\
  \ Not only to discover, not only to take pictures, but also to draw it and I called\
  \ it as Live Sketching\nOnce, Indonesia is well known more as \u2018Bali.\u2019\
  \ It is not the capital, but this island is attractive, with thousands of local\
  \ culture beyond what we can imagine. You can find nature spots, culture, and even\
  \ semi urban living. The people are all smiling. The first and a must for me is\
  \ to do live sketching for some spots, hidden gem, and of course landmarks. \n\n\
  Sketching the nature which consist of beaches, mountains, reef, caves, I can feel\
  \ the wind coming through the lines. The colors of the mountains flows along the\
  \ color of the leaves in my sketchbook. Also, the landmarks gave me many stories\
  \ about the amazing history behind the place.\nThe hidden gems, can you imagine\
  \ taking pictures of places that people has rarely has taken before. It is more\
  \ amazing that if I can experience live sketching the places to show the hidden\
  \ gems a story of the unknown journey.\n\nDiscovering the Sanur Beach, where you\
  \ can hear the enormous waves. Where I can draw the ocean that has bluer sky than\
  \ the other place. Then, I moved to Kuta Beach. The Place full of foreigners, but\
  \ a great spot to draw between the horizon. Here, I sketched the beach with the\
  \ urban surrounding. With the people dancing, taking a picture with a live sketching\
  \ on it.\n\nMoving to the other side called Uluwatu Beach. Here I sketched the reef,\
  \ with the temple around the mountains and sea. Then, the Ubud Beach and forest\
  \ attracted me to sketch the story of the monkey island. With the culture around\
  \ me. And the sound of \u2018Gamelan\u2019 which is the instrument from Bali.\n\
  This is Bali, my island of Indonesia. One of the place that I witness, one of the\
  \ story that I draw. One of the part of my Archipelago for my dearest Indonesia.\n\
  \n-Ends around the world-\nMoving to other country, trying to explore some places\
  \ more. Witness and put not only to the picture, but putting inside the paper through\
  \ the memories, from my eyes and from my hand. Scratches that tells stories. Hearing\
  \ the others explaining the spot.\n\nI really want to witness all things that I\
  \ see into the sketchbook which is my other camera. Which is my other album of memories.\
  \ Witness the lines around the world, sketching what the spots would like to tell\
  \ about. Where the place, culture, peoples, and time blends among my picture, stories,\
  \ and drawings.\n\nThis is what I call as Travelling, and Resketching the world.\
  \ Spreading the story of what we see, and what we witness."
