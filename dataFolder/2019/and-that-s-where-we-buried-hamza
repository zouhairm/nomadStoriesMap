Text: "- And that\u2019s where we buried Hamza. He was nineteen. Young guy.\n- The\
  \ gravestone is nice.\n- That came later. Much later. After the war was over. During\
  \ the war we didn\u2019t have time for that; we had to do our funerals in a hurry.\
  \ Otherwise the snipers\u2026 Bang.\n\nAs I follow Ismail out of the small cemetery,\
  \ I enter again Bra\u0107e Feji\u0107a, buzzing with nightlife. Twenty-five years\
  \ ago this place was a battlefield. From these buildings the Bosnians shot to the\
  \ other side of the Neretva, trying to hit some Croatians. And vice versa. Now it\u2019\
  s full of tourists and backpackers. \n\nI met Ismail by chance on the famous Stari\
  \ Most, the Old Bridge, emblem of the wounds of Mostar. \n\n- I was a baker. But\
  \ when the war started, I had to become a sniper. Everybody had.\n\nMany things\
  \ have changed and sometimes I feel like the foreign travelers became what the UN\
  \ was trying to be: a force from abroad able to unite the two sides of the city\
  \ under the same aim. Business in this case. Sometimes, money can also be a peacekeeper.\
  \ \n\nThe sun is setting. Like every day, it rose on the Bosnian side, crossed the\
  \ Neretva to kiss the divers jumping from the Stari Most, and is about to die on\
  \ the hills behind the Croatian part of the city. That, at least, is always the\
  \ same.\n\nA concert of recorded voices starts at once from the top of all the minarets\
  \ in the eastern part of the city. It\u2019s the call for the sunset prayer, the\
  \ fourth of the day. On the other side, the huge Bell Tower of Peace chimes seven\
  \ times.\n\nWe enter a local place, a small cantine out of the touristic path. The\
  \ menu is in Cyrillic, but even if I could read it, it would have been useless.\
  \ Ismail already ordered for both.\n\n- Burek. Good one. Not the one you eat on\
  \ the shopping street.\n\nHe opens his bottle of Cockta. I ordered one after his\
  \ suggestion and I have to admit it\u2019s not bad at all. \n\nA woman enters and\
  \ greets him, taking place by his side. He already told me about her. Najda fought\
  \ the war next to him, the only woman in the front line. She didn\u2019t have to,\
  \ she had a nice life in Slovenia, the only relatively quiet place during the Balkan\
  \ conflict. When she heard about the tragedy in her birthplace, she drove her car,\
  \ a Zastava Koral, south until the checkpoint, and then she proceeded until Mostar.\
  \ Everyone was trying to escape from Mostar, she somehow managed to enter.\n\n-\
  \ Yugoslavia was heaven. We had a strong economy, we had high level education. And\
  \ fun. How often do you go out for nightlife?\n- Well, on weekends I\u2019d say.\n\
  - We used to go out every night. That was Yugoslavia.\n- And then?\n- And then Tito\
  \ died.\n\nIsmail turns to Najda and starts drawing some gestures with his hands.\
  \ She lost her hearing because of a grenade, towards the end of the conflict. Ismail\
  \ instead, made it to Germany as a refugee. He came back after fifteen years. \n\
  \nIt\u2019s almost midnight and the bazaar streets are empty. A man is washing the\
  \ cobblestones in front of his restaurant; I try to dodge the small streams of water\
  \ on my way back to the hostel. A lonely car proceeds slowly on Mar\u0161ala Tita.\
  \ I wonder if anyone will ever return Najda\u2019s Zastava."
