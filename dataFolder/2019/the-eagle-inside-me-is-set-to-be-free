Text: "One of the worst things about flying is getting trapped in one area for hours,\
  \ with a small child kicking the back of your seat. It was fifteen minutes past\
  \ eight when the airplane took off from Algiers, I leaned my head on the back and\
  \ set about reading an article which says that \u201Ceagles are amazingly majestic\
  \ creatures, soaring high in the sky, overlooking the world with their keen eyes\
  \ and inspiring awe in anyone who sees their incredible wingspan.\u201D I was always\
  \ fascinated by this creature and considered him as a symbol of beauty, freedom,\
  \ and magic. Because deep inside me lived a little brave eaglet that was too shy\
  \ to fly. \nAfter finishing my reading, I dropped off to sleep until we landed in\
  \ the capital of Egypt. When my feet touched the ground of the city of Cairo, the\
  \ view took my breath away, As well as, the historical buildings attracted me. Through\
  \ my journey in Egypt, I got caught in a cycle of admiration that indulged my soul\
  \ so that I was infiltrated by excitement. Each place and corner over there tell\
  \ the history of the ancient Egyptians. For a moment I couldn\u2019t believe that\
  \ am actually standing in front of, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world,\
  \ the old three pyramids of the Giza.\nwhile walking the streets, I came face to\
  \ face with random strangers that some of them were smiling at me in a jovial way,\
  \ others were so friendly and greeting people with hospitality ready to help out.\
  \ Each person I came across was running to earn his or her living, I didn\u2019\
  t expect that behind those smiling faces there were sad, poignant, hidden stories,\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect that every heart has its secrets.\nThe whole world agreed\
  \ that Egypt is the mother of civilization but the thing I have noticed is humanity\
  \ can\u2019t find a place on her lap. People in Egypt live in extreme poverty they\
  \ are unable to provide even basic food, in need of health care. Children engaged\
  \ in hazardous jobs to help their families.\nOne day I stopped for a moment to buy\
  \ a fresh mango juice, this latter was so delicious and quenched my thirst. In a\
  \ fraction of a second, a woman with her children gripped my attention, who was\
  \ riding on a horse-drawn cart singing in a beautiful voice \u201Cone of the songs\
  \ of OUM KULTHUM, Planet of the East, and the most famous female Egyptian singer\
  \ \u201C, she said when I got close to them.\nHer children were gathering the remaining\
  \ sugar can from the back of the juice shop wearing ragged clothes, who were really\
  \ messy-looking. I felt sorry for their difficult unpleasant situation where they\
  \ had to work very hard instead of going to school just like their peers, they were\
  \ so young. I struck up a conversation with them about their dreams and hopes.\n\
  \ The most amazing thing about them is that despite the bad conditions they are\
  \ living in, they were so optimistic and full of laughter. Challenging life to be\
  \ stronger and happier. Their mom told me something that was engraved in my heart\
  \ and my mind \u201Cwe may look poor from the outside, but we are rich from the\
  \ inside, our hearts are full of love, gentleness, and kindness, our hearts bloom\
  \ with grace. If you are thankful for what you have, only then you have everything\
  \ you need.\u201D, she said.\nThe woman and her children made me think and be grateful\
  \ for the things that I have, I understood that happiness is a choice, it is always\
  \ up to you. Every second of our lives is worth living with love and gratitude.\
  \ Happiness comes from within, it\u2019s an inside job. Thanks to them the eagle\
  \ inside me is set to be free, he is no longer that weak, frightened little fledgling.\
  \ Though he has grown in the womb of nature alongside fear and pain but sorrow,\
  \ gloominess can no more surpass him. He is so ready and eager to leave that nest\
  \ towards glory that his wings swaying luxuriously and hugged the sky."
