Text: "The first glimpse is shocking. After winding greenery and fruit stands, the\
  \ highway begins twisting around hills and hugging coast. The water peeks between\
  \ hills and trees and you roll down the window to see if you could smell the sea,\
  \ the subtle hint of salt teasing your nostrils. The car makes a final turn around\
  \ a hill and suddenly it\u2019s a blanket of brilliant blue to your right. From\
  \ the passenger seat, you stick your hand out the window and move it up and down\
  \ through the wind, feeling the waves of the ocean riding with you.\n\nYour first\
  \ weekend getaway with him was in Big Sur. You made up a story about sleeping over\
  \ at Abby\u2019s and packed your backpack and rode off in his rickety Honda Civic.\
  \ The awkward first weeks of dating had passed, and you were wondering where this\
  \ relationship would take you. This first place was paradise.\n\nIn the Julia Pfeiffer\
  \ State Park, there is a small trail that starts at the edge of the road and begins\
  \ taking you down through a short tunnel and then onto the side of the cliff. The\
  \ ocean is larger here than it was from your window, up on the road. You are suddenly\
  \ reminded of how small you are, how the tiny creature that you are is standing\
  \ on the edge of the continent, staring into a sea that eventually grows into others,\
  \ together blanketing the earth. The trail leads you to a viewing platform. Down\
  \ below, on the other side of the curved edge of the cliff is a small beach with\
  \ the McWay Falls. The water comes down from crevices on the mountain and hits a\
  \ pool in the sand, less than a mile away from the waves coming in and out.\n\n\
  He parked the Civic on the side of the road and you both slept in the back, drunk\
  \ with supermarket whiskey. Every so often a car would pass by, shining through\
  \ the windows and waking you up. Sometimes you would forget sleep and look up through\
  \ the windows. He had chosen a spot under a mass of trees, but in between the branches\
  \ you could see the stars, so plentiful in comparison with the city sky under which\
  \ you grew up. You imagined how the ocean must look, mirroring those small, twinkling\
  \ lights, the waves crashing against the cliffs and lapping at beaches now abandoned\
  \ for the night.\n\nYou woke up in the early morning as the sun was still peeking\
  \ in the horizon. The stars that had shown through the trees were gone, but you\
  \ saw the premature rays of daylight sparkling in the dew. Your phone blinked with\
  \ unread messages and missed calls from Mom. She had checked with Abby and found\
  \ that you weren\u2019t there. He drove to a gas station where you had service and\
  \ you called, explaining where you were and who you were with. There was a feeling\
  \ of regret, of shame for lying and getting caught. But as much as you felt sorry\
  \ for sneaking out and lying, you couldn\u2019t help that feeling of satisfaction,\
  \ that your overdue teenage rebellion had brought you to an Eden, just hours away\
  \ from home.\n\nThe next time you see Big Sur, it is after you had moved in together.\
  \ The rickety Civic has long since retired, and you drive in a shiny new Honda Fit.\
  \ Night time has already fallen by the time you set out from home, so the winding\
  \ hills stood dark against the moonlit sky. The car twists and turns around the\
  \ dark sentinels. Where small scenes of brilliant blue had shone in between turns\
  \ and trees, you see glimpses darker than the sky. Finally, the familiar turn comes\
  \ up, car curving around the final hill. You are surrounded by black ocean. It is\
  \ violent this night, sending waves against the cliff side. But every so often it\
  \ subsides and the water is still for a few moment -- just as you imagined that\
  \ first night. The stars twinkle in the still water, shining from above and below\
  \ you. You open the window and stick out your hand, letting it ride in the chilly\
  \ nighttime wind."
