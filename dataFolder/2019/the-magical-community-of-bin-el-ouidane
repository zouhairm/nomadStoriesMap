Text: "It's our third day in Bin El Ouidane.\nThe Google pictures showed a peaceful\
  \ lake. Imagine the most beautiful shade of blue. \nHowever, when we arrived, the\
  \ water levels in the lake were very low. The only way to reach our friend's villa,\
  \ in an area that is pretty much unspoiled, was to park our cars outside a hotel\
  \ that looked abandoned and cross the lake on a small boat.\nIt was dark, pouring\
  \ rain like the last day on earth. \nOnce the boat docked, no one seemed to care\
  \ about the rain, the slippery red clay ground or the darkness, and everybody started\
  \ to climb up, thrilled to finally see our final destination in front of us.\nAs\
  \ I was limping along, a dog appeared from the darkness and started climbing next\
  \ to me. If I stumbled, it would pick me up. If I stopped to catch my breath, it\
  \ would wait for me. \nAt the time, I had no idea that Aroun was going to become\
  \ the mascot of our trip. This lovely dog would regularly disappear in the most\
  \ mysterious circumstances, and then magically re-appear, much to our relief.\n\
  The next morning the sun was shining and the lake looked beautiful. \nBin El Ouidane\
  \ is a rural commune. Female shepherds, kids playing with the animals, women tattooing\
  \ each other and men selling the local produce. A simple life.\nYes, it's Morocco's\
  \ second largest lake, a place that Moroccans use for honeymoons or special weekends,\
  \ but it's also an unexpected surprise on the way between Marrakech and Fez. Driving\
  \ through the scenic road along the Atlas Mountains, there is almost a sense of\
  \ re-discovery, like stripping off layers of unwanted luxury.\nThe more I talk to\
  \ the locals and eat their food, walk their walk, the more I feel attached to this\
  \ place.\nWe are driving around when we glimpse a small group of children outside\
  \ a small building, with a girl who must be 19 or 20 years old.\nThey wave their\
  \ arms and laugh, and we pull over.\nAs the older girl translates from Berber to\
  \ us, the kids start showing interest in what we have in our car, so we give them\
  \ our fresh fruit and cookies. They look ecstatic.\nThe young girl is their school\
  \ teacher, even though this building is not formally a school.\nWe decide to give\
  \ Fatima a lift home, all her students are gone now but one of them is still following\
  \ her every step.  His name is Omar. \nIn the car, we switch from Arabic to English\
  \ and Berber, trying to have a conversation about how they deal with isolation,\
  \ living in such a remote area. About Amazigh women getting their chin and face\
  \ tattoed less and less, as tattoos are forbidden in Islam.\nKhadija doesn't seem\
  \ to care much. She says she wants to get married, asks us if we have a cousin or\
  \ a brother who would be interested in marrying her and taking her to London. We\
  \ all laugh out loud.\nHowever, once we arrive at Khadija's house, I realise that\
  \ maybe hers was bittersweet laughter.\nThe flat is tiny: one big room for the whole\
  \ family, with a dusty rug taking up half of the room. An old TV sits in a corner,\
  \ Khadija turns it on as soon as we walk in, she also turns on the gas cylinder,\
  \ gets a couple of things out of an old fridge. She has a portable stove.\nHomemade\
  \ bread, pickled aubergines, hummus, and some Berber tea.\nWe all sit on the rug,\
  \ the food on a metallic tray where we all share the bread.\nOmar and Fatima look\
  \ incredibly excited, I show Omar how to take a selfie with my phone, we promise\
  \ Fatima we'll send her the photos. \"And some clothes from London,\" she asks cheekily.\n\
  In fact, she asks, can she have my friend\u2019s jumper?\nA few months after our\
  \ trip to Morocco, two Scandinavian tourists are found murdered in the High Atlas\
  \ mountains, not too far from Bin El Ouidane.\nI remember Fatima and Omar, and hope\
  \ that this won't stop people from visiting this unspoiled region of Morocco, and\
  \ this truly magical community."
