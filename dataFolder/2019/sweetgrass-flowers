Text: "It is mid-August in Charleston, South Carolina and I am here to marry a gentle\
  \ man from my hometown in California. I have brought my father with me to give my\
  \ hand in marriage. The air is heavy and wet, it sticks to us and clings our clothes\
  \ to our skin as we walk down Broad street. The street is lined with tall palmettos,\
  \ colorful historic buildings, and locals producing sweetgrass flowers and baskets\
  \ at expert speed. \n\n         A woman in blue catches my eye. She is sitting in\
  \ the shade with an array of sweetgrass merchandise laid out before her on a small\
  \ tarp. I stop at her set-up and tell my father to keep exploring and that I will\
  \ catch up. I watch as her fingers furiously twist and tuck the grass into a genuine\
  \ Charleston memento. Her gaze shifts from the unfinished basket to meet mine, but\
  \ her hands do not stop fastening the grass. A friendly smile spreads across sweet\
  \ cinnamon skin. She says, \u201CDo you see anything you like, honey?\u201D Her\
  \ voice is saturated in southern drawl. \n\n          \u201CEverything is so beautiful,\u201D\
  \ I reply, \u201CI don\u2019t know what to choose.\u201D\n\n          \u201CPick\
  \ the one that brings the most joy to you,\u201D she says through a grin. I search\
  \ through the baskets attempting to feel the \u201Cjoy\u201D with each one I pick\
  \ up. I decide on a small yellow and red basket that fits in the palm of my hand.\
  \ \n\n         \u201CI will take this one, it\u2019s the perfect size for a ring\
  \ dish!\u201D \n\n         \u201CAh, yes, it is the perfect size\u201D \u2014she\
  \ looks to my left ring finger\u2014 \u201Cfor such a beautiful ring!\u201D My cheeks\
  \ flush with warm blood as I look at my ring, a gift with the promise to wed from\
  \ my gentle man. \n\n         \u201COh, thank you!\u201D I gush. \u201CI am getting\
  \ married under the gazebo tomorrow at White Point Gardens. I am nervous and incredibly\
  \ excited at the same time.\u201D\n\n         \u201CYou will be a beautiful bride.\
  \ I\u2019m gonna charge you ten dollars for the ring dish and please take this as\
  \ well as a wedding gift.\u201D She says while handing me a beautifully woven black\
  \ and white vase holding three sweetgrass flowers. \n\n         \u201CYou are so\
  \ kind, but I couldn\u2019t possibly accept this without paying for it.\u201D \n\
  \n         \u201CYes you can honey, it\u2019s a gift,\u201D she says, \u201CI know\
  \ love when I see it and you baby, you\u2019re in love and getting married. That\
  \ is some thing to celebrate. So, pay me my ten dollars and accept my best wishes.\u201D\
  \ I thank her repeatedly and pay her the ten dollars. I set down my Charleston treasures\
  \ and ask for a hug to give my gratitude for showing me such kindness. She wraps\
  \ her soft arms around me and kisses my cheek before letting go. I tell her I would\
  \ like her to come to my wedding and to meet my future husband.\n\n         \u201C\
  It\u2019s at 5 o\u2019clock, okay?\u201D\n\n         \u201CI\u2019ll be there and\
  \ I\u2019m bringing my grandbabies if that\u2019s okay with you.\u201D\n\n     \
  \    \u201COf course,\u201D I say picking up my things \u201CI didn\u2019t get your\
  \ name.\u201D\n\n         \u201CIzetta, what\u2019s yours?\u201D\n\n         \u201C\
  Orlawna.\u201D\n\n         \u201CThat\u2019s a beautiful name. I\u2019ll see y\u2019\
  all tomorrow, Orlawna.\u201D I wave goodbye and catch up to my father waiting on\
  \ the steps of the city hall.\n\n         It is the day of my wedding and as always,\
  \ I am fashionably late. I walk up to the gazebo with one hand wedged in my father\u2019\
  s elbow and the other holding my bouquet. I am shaking from a mixture nervousness\
  \ and glee as I approach the alter. My father and fianc\xE9 shake hands, hug, and\
  \ exchange a few quiet words among them to start off the ceremony. I search the\
  \ crowd to find Izetta. She is wearing blue again but this time it is a formal lacy\
  \ dress. With her are three giggling girls brightly dressed in pink. She smiles\
  \ and waves. \n\n         After the ceremony I take my husband to meet my new friend\
  \ Izetta and the girls. She hugs the both of us and thanks us for the invitation.\
  \ \u201CThis was the most beautiful wedding I\u2019ve ever been to,\u201D she says,\
  \ \u201Cand I\u2019m so happy to witness such a kind and wonderful love.\u201D"
