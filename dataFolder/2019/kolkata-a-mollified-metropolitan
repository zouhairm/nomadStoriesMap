Text: "No, I\u2019m not biased but the grace that this city holds is what I miss the\
  \ most. Getting to witness all of it\u2019s charm and warmth all over again is a\
  \ different story altogether.\n\nThe evening rain accompanied by two hot fried shingharas(samosa)\
  \ from the roadside at Camac Street became my companion. I got no cabs to drop me\
  \ home. There was traffic. There was rain. But there was no chaos. It was calm.\
  \ The cool winds hitting my face. There was nothing unpleasant about the situation.\
  \ Waiting for my bus, I grabbed a Chicken Roll to munch on. This is something you\
  \ have to commit your rainy evenings to. The exotic combination of a Chicken Roll\
  \ and a rainy evening at Kolkata is unmatched. Jhal muri with beguni being the second,\
  \ obviously.\nFinally,I got a traveller and and rushed back home after waiting for\
  \ more than an hour. The wait is never boring. I am used to everything here. The\
  \ charm still appeals me. I got no stares from anyone.I wasn\u2019t in a hurry to\
  \ go back home. I was comfortable which is not the case in Delhi NCR.While I was\
  \ returning,I just smiled to myself thinking about how pristine and unblemished\
  \ the city and it\u2019s people are. The humanly connection a shopkeeper holds with\
  \ his customer or the clouds have with this city is just omnipotent. Nothing can\
  \ change all of this. Neither time nor the changing living standards.\n\nThis is\
  \ a Metropolitan city which holds back itself and packs with it humid days, breezy\
  \ nights, amazing and pocket friendly food and ofcourse the maach. The wet ground\
  \ of the paras reflect the street light and highlight the beauty of heritage houses.\
  \ Kolkata emits an old world charm which you will find nowhere else."
