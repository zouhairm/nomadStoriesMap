Text: "It was my second time traveling alone. But still my first one working on another\
  \ country.\nI had heard that being a volunteer would be about \"leaving your confort\
  \ zone\". I know it's an old, clich\xE9 phrase, but it could fit the situation I\
  \ was about to enter.\nI met a few other brazilian trainees there, when we first\
  \ arrived in C\xF3rdoba's airport. We spent our first to days in a moderately good\
  \ hostel, and then were sent to another, which was not even ready to \"host\" anyone.\
  \ The building used to be a child hospital in the past, and still looked like an\
  \ old, abandoned one.\nDuring the starting days, some things were interesting to\
  \ notice. Like the large number of icecream shops, probably due to the hot weather.\
  \ There were large pieces of meat in some meals at almost every place, and chicken\
  \ was also very common. A single lunch costed over 100 argentine \"pesos\", since\
  \ the currency was in such a low value. I didn't know when was the last time I had\
  \ seen so many stray dogs, but even their behavior was quite different, following\
  \ us around in a way a brazilian dog would hardly do. They looked more well-fed,\
  \ too.\nBut nothing I saw at the city center was like the small comunity where the\
  \ NGO where I would work was located. To get there, I had to take a bus for a twenty\
  \ minutes to half an hour route. Then, cross the train rails and get to the group\
  \ of paintless houses among unasphalted streets of soil.\nThat was my first time\
  \ inside a poor community, a contact with a much different reality. The NGO was\
  \ called \"Copa de Leche\" (\"Cup of Milk\"), and was a small house where parents\
  \ could leave their children during the morning, while they were working. We helped\
  \ to educate the kids, teaching them math, geography, portuguese, english, and the\
  \ little spanish we knew. We showed them some music tracks and gave them some time\
  \ to relax on the football camp.\nI got to know the kids to some extent. Some had\
  \ more trouble learning than others. One of them was still really little, but had\
  \ a cunning mind for math, solving some advanced multiplication problems with ease.\
  \ There was one boy, however, whose education proved to be a challenge: his name\
  \ was Lautaro, and he was eleven years old. That's far older than most of the other\
  \ infants. I never had the chance to talk to his parents and ask about his time\
  \ in school, but it was clear that he had his problems. For some reason, he didn't\
  \ know how to read and, when we tried to sit and teach him, Lautaro would just get\
  \ up and leave the house. He would also scream when we intervened on fights betwen\
  \ him and other boys. An even more serious problem was in how he behaved near female\
  \ teachers: he tried to hug them all the time, and he talked a lot about atractive\
  \ women. Apparently, never received sex education.\nEveryone agreed it wasn't Lautaro's\
  \ fault. The owner said his parents were \"hard to deal with\". He once said himself\
  \ that his mother was always busy and his father never helped him with anything.\n\
  My main job there was to make interviews through the neighborhood and gather information,\
  \ and despite asking some stuff about garbage colection and other issues, education\
  \ was alway the main subject. Acording to the area residents, there was a public\
  \ school not too far alway, but some still wished that their sons and daughters\
  \ would learn english and have more opportunities. Despite that, seemed that the\
  \ most recurrent reason for people to live kids at the NGO was because they could\
  \ have lunch there.\nIn the community, dogs didn't look that healthy. Often, all\
  \ houses ran out of energy. They also had no filtered water, and were located close\
  \ to the stench of a sewage outlet\nAfter some time, we made some difference. A\
  \ crowdfunding had good results and the children learned some things. Even Lautaro\
  \ stopped rejecting his lessons. I too learned something, after seeing a little\
  \ of how hard life is for many."
