Text: "As we walked up the road leading to Surya Mandir (Temple of the Sun God) in\
  \ Jaipur India, I had a sneaky suspicion that the locals here were a bit rougher\
  \ than in other areas I\u2019d visited. The monkeys lining the walk sat perched\
  \ on the steep edges like kings of the castle, daring anyone to challenge them.\n\
  As if to confirm my suspicions, I saw a monkey slap a goat across the face for trying\
  \ to eat its pile of treats, purchased and left by other tourists. These monkeys\
  \ were the masters of this domain and not to be messed with!\nWe made our way up\
  \ to the mountain top of Surya Mandir easily enough, taking pictures of the magnificent\
  \ views over the pink city and the furry creatures that sit and overlook their kingdom.\n\
  My friend and I were on a 3-week tour through India and had taken the opportunity\
  \ of our free day to see the sights of Jaipur. Having just come from the Amber Fort,\
  \ we were intent on visiting the Surya Mandir. This temple is part of the larger\
  \ Galta Ji Temple complex, otherwise known as \u201CThe Monkey Temple\u201D.\nAs\
  \ we admired the amazing views the temple offered of the city, a few monkeys began\
  \ to join us through small openings in the temples thick balcony wall. Previous\
  \ experience has taught me to give these guys their space and, on the advice of\
  \ a travel book, not to look them in the eye as they may see this as a challenge.\
  \ \nAs I casually looked away from the most recent arrival, I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but notice this particular monkey was looking directly at me. Using my peripheral\
  \ vision, I could see that he was indeed very interested in me.\nFeeling a bit unnerved\
  \ I cautiously took a step backwards, keeping the creature within my field of view.\
  \ To my dismay, he too took a step\u2026 towards me. Again, I stepped back and he\
  \ stepped forwards. I slowly started walking backwards and he kept a steady pace\
  \ towards me. He was closing the gap between us much too quickly for my liking.\
  \ Fear now rising within me, all I could do was say \u201CMonkey! Monkey!\u201D\
  \ in a high pitched, slightly panicked voice to my friend, in the hopes that she\
  \ had some clue as to how to rid me of this stalker. My friend gave me a look that\
  \ said she had no idea what to do about this problem either and I was on my own.\n\
  With the monkey\u2019s torpedo-like gaze firmly locked on me, I felt like the target\
  \ in a game of battleship with no escape. At this point I was thinking I\u2019d\
  \ have to either: a) run and hide (where do you hide from a monkey?!); or b) relinquish\
  \ some piece of clothing, baggage, etc. that I had with me as a peace offering.\
  \ I looked down and saw my camera, day bag and sweater tied around my waist, knowing\
  \ full well that anything I gave to this creature would never be mine again.\nThen\
  \ I spotted my orange flower necklace made of carnations, the one I had received\
  \ while visiting the temple within the Amber Fort. There it was, hanging around\
  \ my neck like a beacon calling to the monkey. Perfect! I was definitely willing\
  \ to sacrifice this in order to secure my freedom from a monkey attack (and possibly\
  \ a trip to the local hospital for a monkey bite and a rabies shot). I hastily took\
  \ off the necklace, tossed it to the monkey and took a few hurried steps towards\
  \ the entrance of the temple. Looking over my shoulder I saw the monkey grab his\
  \ prize and run away to a far corner where he could enjoy his hard-earned bounty\
  \ in peace.\nFilled with relief and a bit of pride for having survived an almost-\
  \ monkey- attack, I was ready to move on. Based on what happened to me, my friend\
  \ though it would be a good idea to donate her flower necklace to the residents\
  \ of the temple before they demanded a payment from her too."
