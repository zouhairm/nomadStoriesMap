Text: "Quiet, not cold, most defined Pitumarca at 4:15 am. I extracted myself from\
  \ weighty layers of alpaca blankets and tiptoed past maize drying on the creaking\
  \ wooden floor, trying not to wake the hospedaje owners sleeping behind the tienda\
  \ downstairs, and met my team by the van.  No sound was present in the town square,\
  \ where buses would later bring tourists who recently discovered nearby Rainbow\
  \ Mountain.\n\nWe were on a different trip. I\u2019d secured an internship with\
  \ a nonprofit working with rural Quechua families to improve their homes and environment.\
  \ Villages near Rainbow Mountain had experienced economic revitalization, some families\
  \ even able to purchase solar panels to provide reading light to their children,\
  \ but the other side of the valley was still barely subsisting. We embarked early\
  \ to visit alpaca herders before they took their animals high into the hills, hoping\
  \ to convince them to build chimneys in their homes so cooking fire smoke would\
  \ go out of the house instead of into their lungs.\n\nWe drove up and up to the\
  \ very end of a precariously winding road, parked the van and walked higher still.\
  \ Behind us, dawn threatened to break over Ausangate, the Incas\u2019 most sacred\
  \ mountain god. Ice rivulets and frozen turf crunched beneath our feet. Above 15,000\
  \ feet, air holds little heat and the chill would linger much longer until the intense\
  \ sun could bake the frost away.  \n\nWe eventually approached a dispersed community.\
  \ Each home, built of stone or sometimes sod, was a living testament to Incan construction:\
  \ a thatched roof over one small room with a low doorway, cookstove in the center,\
  \ niches in the walls and a platform bed made cozy with skins and heavy wool blankets.\
  \ Small exterior rooms stored dried llama dung for fuel. Raw meat was set out on\
  \ rocks to freeze-dry.\n\n\u201CSenora! Allillanchu!\u201D My boss Larry called\
  \ the lady of the house at every doorway, empowering her to make decisions for her\
  \ family. His fluent Quechua and encouraging demeanor won them over.\n\nThe first\
  \ home held a young couple and their infant daughter. They gave us a few pieces\
  \ of fry bread; we shared our oranges. Fresh fruit is rare where it\u2019s too high\
  \ for even potatoes to grow. Hungrily tearing into my bread, I realized my colleagues\
  \ were saving theirs. Shortly after departing they instructed me to stay close as\
  \ a neighbor\u2019s protective dogs challenged our presence in the valley. The bread\
  \ was our ticket for safe passage up the trail. \n\nNearby, we chatted briefly with\
  \ several women starting their day together, their flock of sheep corralled nearby,\
  \ until they shooed us away and told us to return on the way down. \n\nOur next\
  \ stop was the winter home of a successful couple \u2013 he was a trekking guide\
  \ with a strong American handshake. I sat by his wife in the sun while Larry talked\
  \ about building a chimney. He was reluctant to take time away from work until he\
  \ learned about his wife\u2019s health risks from cooking over a fire. He looked\
  \ at her lovingly, her own gaze focused on their herd, and committed to the construction.\
  \ \n\nAt the top of our trek, we met a 72-year-old woman, with the finest alpacas\
  \ I\u2019d seen. Living alone, she tended her animals and wove their wool into traditional\
  \ finery. A true beauty, few teeth left but delicate features and vibrant eyes looking\
  \ beyond her deeply lined face, she must have been stunning in her day. She still\
  \ wore her wedding hat.\n\nAlpacas were anxious to climb up to the warming sun,\
  \ and it was time for the herders to go. \n\nWe turned downhill, stopping to revisit\
  \ the ladies as requested. They had made us hot potato stew with lamb. No chairs,\
  \ we sat on the bed while the cook served a delicious meal to her three guests using\
  \ every bowl she owned. She proudly told us she had walked two days to carry her\
  \ new metal roof up from town. The food and conversation warmed me more than I knew\
  \ I needed.\n\nRetracing our steps, melting ice making each step treacherous as\
  \ the sun finally rose over Ausangate, we waved and called \u201Ctupananchiskama,\u201D\
  \ Quechua for \u201Csee you again.\u201D"
