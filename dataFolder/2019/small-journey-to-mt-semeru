Text: "That night, me and 9 friends dashed towards the nearest train station.\nWe\
  \ were ready to start a small journey. A small journey with plenty of big lessons\
  \ and message. A journey to reach the highest peak in Java - Indonesia, Mount Semeru\
  \ be it\u2019s name. A mountain with the height of 3676 MASL. In the morning, carrying\
  \ our own carrier, we left the base-camp and ready to start the hike. Hiking up\
  \ a mountain is not easy, but it\u2019s there where we can know each others. Leaving\
  \ all the modern amenities in the city, friendship without material judgement. We\
  \ hiked for 4 days and 3 nights. Starting at 10 in the morning, we walked, slow\
  \ yet surely, step by step. Till day turn to dusk, and we were greeted by the night\
  \ rain. The slippery pathways made our journey more challenging. Cold and wet, we\
  \ arrived to the first resting place. Relieved, it was unfortunately too dark for\
  \ us to appreciate any kind of view. We were only able to make out tent and rest.The\
  \ next morning, we were awoken by the sun. When the tent opened, a gust of morning\
  \ wind slipped into our tent. Our eyes were lavished by the lake which span wide\
  \ between 2 hills right outside out tent. Ranu Kumbolo be it\u2019s name. \u201C\
  Don\u2019t get too lax, the trip is still long\u201D Said one of our guide. After\
  \ breakfast and a quick stretch, we continued our journey towards the second resting\
  \ place. We arrived there at around 1 in the afternoon.  People generally call this\
  \ place with the name, Kalimati. From here, the peak of Mount Semeru is in clear\
  \ sight. It stands firm, even the clouds are hesitant to cover it. Truly, not one\
  \ moment can be dismissed. The feeling of missing home was replaced by the beautiful\
  \ sight. After making the tent, joking around, and enjoying the atmosphere, we quickly\
  \ rested. Later tonight, we must awoken to reach the peak. 2 in the early morning,\
  \ we were ready to head out for the summit. The challenges piling up. Travelling\
  \ without the sun, even the cold night wind did not waver our determination. The\
  \ track we went through was also far from friendly. Sand, gravel, and pieces of\
  \ boulder greeted us. Encouraging each other shoulder to shoulder was the warmest\
  \ thing that happened then. Until one moment, halfway to the top, our friendship\
  \ was tested. Whether it was fatigue, or the cold weather, one of my friend have\
  \ difficulty breathing. She nearly failed to continue. Her steps slowly diminishing\
  \ to nothing much like her spirit. At the start, we were happily giving her encouragement.\
  \ Shouting \u201CLet\u2019s go, we\u2019re almost there!\u201D or \u201Ccome on,\
  \ you can do it!\u201D. But, along with the rise of sunlight, our ego rises with\
  \ it. The dream of watching the sunrise from the highest peak of Java nearly allured\
  \ us to leave our friend. This is where the biggest message lies. To hold one ego\
  \ for another. Trying our hardest for someone else, and to fight any limitation\
  \ we have. Becoming much stronger than anything you\u2019ve ever imagined. 8 in\
  \ the morning, everyone was tired yet relieved. We reached the top without anyone\
  \ left behind. No one was unable to see the sunrise from the peak, because we realized\
  \ it wasn\u2019t what we were after. The most important thing, we were all able\
  \ to view the same thing, together. Looking in awe of the beauty that lies far below.\
  \ The open blue sky dotted with clouds which gave shade to the green landscape below.\
  \ When i saw it, i realized how small human are. Too small for the word selfish.\
  \ Truly a disgrace if i were to left my friend behind down there. Nature truly is\
  \ the best teacher. In it\u2019s eyes, humans are equal. No is rich nor poor. Nature\
  \ only views one thing, and that\u2019s those who try their best."
