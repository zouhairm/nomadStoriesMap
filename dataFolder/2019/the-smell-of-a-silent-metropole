Text: "\"We should stay home and only leave tonight.\" \"No way! You don't have to\
  \ be afraid of the rain and we will leave right now,\" I said to my friend while\
  \ grabbing her arm and pulling her close to me, under our umbrella.  If I was at\
  \ home, definitely that storm would have scared me a lot, and I would never leave\
  \ the house. However, if there's something special about traveling is the fact that\
  \ nothing holds you back and you are allowed to be kind of reckless. I was willing\
  \ to show her that face our fears can actually be really pleasant. Me and Ana, my\
  \ friend, were in Buenos Aires for four days at that moment. It was our first Saturday\
  \ off after attending our first academic event, the main reason why we were there,\
  \ actually. Unfortunately, it wasn't one of the sunniest days in Palermo, the bohemian\
  \ and cool neighborhood with so many beautiful parks and electric atmosphere. It\
  \ was so rainy that all we saw on news was how a very expected soccer game had to\
  \ be canceled causing frustration on many supporters.  \n\nThat afternoon I guided\
  \ us through the streets of Palermo Soho, where we ended up having a delicious lunch\
  \ before exploring a small and local bookstore nearby. That\u2019s one of the greatest\
  \ things in Buenos Aires that is hard to find back home, in Brazil: the huge number\
  \ of cozy and welcoming bookstores where is usually placed a charming caf\xE9. In\
  \ B.A., you can find a vibrant air of a Metropole with big avenues and parks combined\
  \ with a bucolic and artsy feeling from the museums and caf\xE9s. This gives us\
  \ a good hint of why writers like Jorge Luis Borges and other artists usually mentioned\
  \ the city as incredibly inspiring.\n\nAfter leaving Eterna Cadencia, the bookstore\
  \ that won Ana's heart, we headed to the city center, where we were supposed to\
  \ take the bus to our first stop of the night. If we left home after midday, I must\
  \ say that at this point was almost 7 pm. Our plans included a tour among some museums\
  \ during Noche de Los Museos, an event that takes place once in a year when almost\
  \ all the museums are open with free access during the night.\n\nWe dropped off\
  \ the subway in a completely empty city center \u2013 there was almost no one, nowhere,\
  \ and all we could smell was the rain. My friend was attached to my arms so hard\
  \ that I could feel all her weight above me. I had to calm her down for a minute.\
  \ That day we got remarkable scenarios to our memories: some of the greatest Buenos\
  \ Aires\u2019 postcards like the Obelisco, Casa Rosada, and Teatro Col\xF3n covered\
  \ by clouds. Since we have a blue sky every day back home in Northeast Brazil, clouds\
  \ in the sky can be actually our real concept of good weather. \n\nThere, we got\
  \ distracted over the views, the pictures, and buildings, a whole new side of the\
  \ capital that we still haven\u2019t the chance to explore. We canceled our first\
  \ plans once we got lost trying to come back to where we started. Instead, we decided\
  \ to just enter the open places we found in our path. And that was how we discovered\
  \ the Kirchner Cultural Center and it\u2019s classical and modern architecture mix,\
  \ watched an emotive performance of Argentina\u2019s national anthem and entered\
  \ Casa Rosada, also known as the president's office. \n\nI could say that ditch\
  \ our plans was the best plan due to all the unusual things we did \u2013 I mean,\
  \ get the chance to visit the government office is not that simple and we did it\
  \ just getting in a line. But, beyond that, experience a constant crowd and warming\
  \ place on a silent and calm moment gave me that feeling that doesn\u2019t matter\
  \ if things are granted like a crowd city center, there are always clouds to change\
  \ the scenario \u2013 and when this happens the most important thing to do is to\
  \ enjoy the ride and smell the air. During the rest of the trip, never rained like\
  \ that again."
