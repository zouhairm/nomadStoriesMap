Text: "He was dashing, handsome and well dressed. We had history in being each other\u2019\
  s first post high school romance. Now at age 41 I was eager for an adventure and\
  \ excited for the rekindling of a long lost love. I jumped at the opportunity to\
  \ date. When he suggested I meet him in Scotland and England I didn\u2019t hesitated\
  \ to say yes. Do you remember the phrase \u201CIf it\u2019s too good to be true,\
  \ then it probably is.\u201D Well I did not.\nI landed in Scotland and was giddy\
  \ with excitement.  Fashion Designer Jeff had been working on a photo shoot so he\
  \ couldn\u2019t pick me up. I found my way to the train to take me to the AirBnb\
  \ I had booked. We were in Edinburough, and I was so excited to see the castle!\
  \ The first night he suggested we go on a tour of the town.  We went on a ghost\
  \ tour and did whiskey tasting. I had just been to his home in Nashville and was\
  \ excited to see him again! He assured me we were monogamous.  I had full faith\
  \ and trust in him because of our past. \nI noticed we weren\u2019t going into the\
  \ castle. We went to a lot of sites and saw many things. But not the castle. He\
  \ asked me to take many pictures of him. Only him. He did not want to take photos\
  \ with me because of his \u201Cpublic image\u201D. So all of my photos are selfies\
  \ of him! On day three I noticed that he liked to take his time in the bathroom.\
  \ But then when I would try to go to to get ready he would get angry and say we\
  \ needed leave.  I got in trouble for putting my suitcase in the wrong spot or changing\
  \ clothes at the wrong time. Things were unraveling quickly. He said we should stop\
  \ at certain places but then we would miss the appointments because he wanted to\
  \ stop on the way. On one road trip we literally passed by Loch Ness and I had to\
  \ cancel the hotel I had paid for. On another trip we passed by Stone Henge and\
  \ were too late to go in. None of the places I booked were \u201Cgood enough\u201D\
  \ for him. (And I was paying for everything.)  He got upset when he thought I matched\
  \ his clothes too much. \nMy dreams of the big castle tour with a romantic man quickly\
  \ halted. Surely, someone could not be this mean or vain. He said that he was researching\
  \ Queen Mary for a fashion show and I said I loved her and felt like she found a\
  \ lot of significance in her name. He laughed at me. (I later found out that one\
  \ of my ancestors was a direct helper and right hand man to Mary! And many in her\
  \ court were also named  Mary.) He put down whatever I did, wore or said. And I\
  \ put up with it. I remained quiet but I stewed. I paid for most every meal. He\
  \ was constantly questioning the menu or prices, constantly asking them to make\
  \ his drink an \u201COld Fashioned\u201D the perfect way and then sending it back.\
  \ I paid for almost all hotels except the cheap ones that don\u2019t even show up\
  \ on a map. Wanting so badly for the fantasy to be true and not the reality, I went\
  \ on yet another trip with him after this to London. It was even worse. The abuse\
  \ got worse and nagging continued all while I foot the bill.  I\u2019m so angry\
  \ with myself yet to this day.  When truth and illusion collide, how does one react?\
  \ These are all questions that I\u2019m now asking myself after having been not\
  \ allowed to use the bathroom, change clothes and being held too tight at night\
  \ or allowed to leave  in Knotting Hill. He asked if \u201Ctrusted him\u201D, when\
  \ he refused to wear a condom because it was \u201Ctoxic.\u201D He also kept asking\
  \ me about prostitution. I thought it was a strange question.\nSad thing? I\u2019\
  ve recently found there\u2019s others  from around the world with the same story,\
  \ same man.  Moral? Choose your travel partner wisely."
