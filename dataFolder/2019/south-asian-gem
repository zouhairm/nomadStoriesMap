Text: "Srilanka a south Asian gem. I was in srilanka for 12 days. What a wonderful\
  \ country . I planed my trip start from Negombo Airport  to Matara by bus. Then\
  \ Taking famous tuk tuk to my hostel Mirissa. Ahh Mirisaa the wonder of srilanka.\
  \ I was so emotional that I stayed there 5 days .I did not expect the hill and beach\
  \ combination . It was mirissa secret beach. It was so beautiful. After full fill\
  \ my thirst of beach next destination Galle . The galle Dutch fort is another milestone\
  \ of srilanka. The best part of the tour was watching baby turtles \U0001F422  swimming\
  \ in Unawatuna. This is the best place for snorkeling. A super chilled place . After\
  \ done all of my listed beach the time came to taste the green natures. I took a\
  \ bus Matara to Ella. The beautiful Ella . A green hill station. Ella had the most\
  \ stunning view the nine archers bridge. Off what a place . The little Adams peck.\
  \ The stunning view. I was there for 2 days . Now the time came that I really did\
  \ not expect the train journey Ella to Kandy. The best train journey that I had\
  \ made in my life. I got first kicked when the train arrived . The station master\
  \ had some leather ring in his left hand and the train master took it in his right\
  \ arm in running. It made every passenger cray. Then the train ran through its line\
  \ . After passing Ella the real beauty exposed . We the passenger left our seat\
  \ and sat on trains door to see the beauty. After two and half hour something happen\
  \ for that I was not totally prepare . Nanuwaya the haven of teas . I had no plan\
  \ to visit Nanuwaya. I was so crazy to saw the view I decided to get off from the\
  \ train . Whatever i took ticket for kandy. I took a tuk tuk for 6 hour to visit\
  \ all the places . My driver was so friendly he offered me to go Nuyer Ella another\
  \ stunning place in srilanka. I wish I kissed that guy after reaching the green\
  \ haven. This place is called little England though I don\u2019t ever England, however\
  \ I understand how beautiful England is. I brought some famous tea from there. Everything\
  \ was so beautiful there . By the by the presidents relaxation home is in Nuyer\
  \ Ella. After unexpected tour I took bus for Kandy. Kandy a historical place a city\
  \ that is a hill station as well but it is a city. Srilankas famous city . The tooth\
  \ temple is famous for Kandy and the lake o it\u2019s best to had a noon seating\
  \ there. After kandy I took bus for Lino rock . It is impossible to write the feelings\
  \ about that place . How a rocks became a city ? The answer you have to visit there.\
  \ After that I took bus for Colombo . I felt bad because I had only 2 days in srilanka\
  \ . Early morning reached Colombo the capital of srilanka a well organized city\
  \ . All the morden facilities there. I took a tuk tuk for Dutch Hospital for had\
  \ a beer . As I am not a urban guy I did not feel pretty. The very next morning\
  \ I took a tuk tuk for Colombo train station for Hikkaduwa. The another kicked I\
  \ got the train journey Colombo to Hikkaduwa. This time the track beside laccadive\
  \ sea. Off I didn\u2019t understand how two and half hour passed. Hikkaduwa famous\
  \ for snorkeling. I did it 3 hours . One that day I return Colombo. Next morning\
  \ I had my flight to my country . This is how I ended my journey.\n\nNote:\n\nIntercity\

  \ are expensive.\nFor short journey tuk tuk are best.\nMotor bikes and bycycles\
  \ are available for rent day wise and it is cheap. \n\nAccommodation:\nWorld class\
  \ hotel and hostels are there. Hostels are starting from 5$\nBudget rooms available\
