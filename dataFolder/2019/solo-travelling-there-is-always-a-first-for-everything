Text: "Resigning from a job that you thought you always wanted definitely leaves a\
  \ bad feeling. I just resigned from my current work after only three-week working\
  \ there. Sounds pathetic? Well, here's the thing. I am an introverted guy who always\
  \ feel unease every time I jump into a new environment. Usually, I can handle myself\
  \ well. But at that time, it felt different. I felt so uncomfortable and awfully\
  \ stressed out. Therefore. I decided to resign and take a break. \n\nI surfed online\
  \ to see what can help me feeling better, and solo-travelling is one of them. After\
  \ an online-search for the best place to solo-travel in Indonesia, Yogyakarta is\
  \ on top of the list. As one of the most cultured and naturally diverse place in\
  \ Indonesia, there is no doubt in my mind that Yogyakarta is a great place to go.\
  \ Without further a due, I booked a plane ticket and guest house, planned the itinerary,\
  \ packed my suitcase, and go! \n\nI didn't have any expectation for Yogyakarta.\
  \ I just want to have a good time after all the drama in the past weeks. Yet, Yogyakarta\
  \ surprises me. On the first day, I took Trans Jogja, a bus ride to commute me to\
  \ my guest house and it only costs around 15 cent! Then, I went to Taman Sari Yogyakarta,\
  \ an ex bathing house for royal family in Yogyakarta. I hired a local guide and\
  \ he acted as my photographer and explained to me about the history of Taman Sari.\
  \ Next, I went to Vrederburg Museum, a dutch colonial museum that showcases the\
  \ dioramas of Indonesian history.\n\nThe next day, I went to Magelang, Central Java\
  \ and caught sunrise at Punthuk Sethumbu. It's a sunrise spot and the view was breathtaking.\
  \ Then, I went to the majestic Borobudur Temple. It's so awesome and worth all the\
  \ climb. This thousands-year-old temple is amazeballs and it makes you wondering\
  \ on how our ancestors were able to build such temple with only stacking rocks and\
  \ it remains strong until now. The adventures didn't stop there! I visited another\
  \ destination called Bukit Rhema. It's an old church turned to praying hall for\
  \ all religions. The building looks funny with the statue of crown-worn pigeon.\
  \ After taking lots of pics - typical Asian tourist - I went back to Yogyakarta.\
  \ On my way back, I visited Situs Warungboto, it's a ruin that shares similar vibe\
  \ with Taman Sari yet it's free of charge!\n\nOn the third day, I decided to meet\
  \ local who I chatted on Tinder - genius, isn't it? - and decided to explore Yogyakarta\
  \ together. We went to Keraton Yogyakarta, the palace of Sultan of Yogyakarta, then\
  \ commuted to Prambanan Temple. If Borobudur is a one gigantic temple, this one\
  \ is a complex consisting of several temples. The other difference is that Borobudur\
  \ is a Buddhist temple, while Prambanan is a Hindu temple yet both is equally charming!\
  \ After that, I went to another temple called Ratu Boko. This temple is superb.\
  \ The view from above is stunning and it's a perfect spot to catch sunset. When\
  \ the sunlight goes down, it creates a beautiful silhouette that's so instagramable!\n\
  \nOn the last day, I went souvenir shops hopping to bring something home. Definitely,\
  \ I bought Bakpia Pathok! It's a sweet-rolls stuffed with different fillings. My\
  \ favorite is chocolate and cheese. It's so damn good! Long story short, I flew\
  \ back to Jakarta and arrived safely - with happy state of mind - home.\n\nIt was\
  \ such a fun journey of mine and I never think that I would enjoy solo-travelling.\
  \ I met a lot of new exciting people, starting from an 40-year-old lady who is also\
  \ solo-traveler, mother and daughter who enjoyed holiday together, to school kids\
  \ who helped me taking pictures. It's just pure happiness. As introverted guy, the\
  \ journey validates that actually I am not anti-social, I still have it in me to\
  \ make friends and have a nice conversation. Overall, this journey is not just a\
  \ getaway from my miserable life, but it taught me about myself and gaining my confidence\
  \ back in facing the next chapter of my life. It was indeed my first solo-traveling\
  \ moment, but surely it won't be the last!"
