Text: "When I first decided to travel abroad, the biggest question was where I wanted\
  \ to go, but the deciding factor ended up being which destination was the cheapest.\
  \ Being a broke, young, college-graduate, I couldn't justify spending thousands\
  \ of dollars on any of the destinations I dreamed of visiting. I searched numerous\
  \ travel sites, desperately trying to find a trip I could afford. In short, when\
  \ I stumbled upon a 12-day trip to Thailand through Intro Travel for only $950 -\
  \ plus a $700 roundtrip flight - I couldn't resist.\n\nI had never considered traveling\
  \ to Southeast Asia before booking this trip. This region was not only a mystery\
  \ to me, but I had never had my interest piqued by any of the countries in the area.\
  \ I'll be honest - I had always dreamed of visiting Europe like most other people\
  \ my age. I dreamed of sipping wine in the vineyards of Piedmont, swimming in the\
  \ crystal-blue waters of Mykonos, and walking the streets of Paris. Laos? Never\
  \ heard of it. Vietnam? Meh. Myanmar? Forget about it. But planning a trip to Thailand\
  \ changed it all for me. I started researching countries nearby and their natural\
  \ landmarks, capital cities, and cultural events. I spent hours getting lost in\
  \ the labyrinth of Google images, mesmerized by the beauty I saw. Even before the\
  \ trip, my mindset regarding Southeast Asia was beginning to change. \n\nFull moon\
  \ parties. Night markets. Bartering. Monkey beaches. It all sounded so exciting\
  \ and new to me. I had never experienced any of those things before - and I was\
  \ willing to try it all. I expected long nights of partying and relaxing days in\
  \ the sun; I expected to discover the enjoyment that comes with snorkeling coral\
  \ reefs; I expected authentic Thai food to satisfy me; I expected the whiplash of\
  \ riding in the back of a tuk tuk; and I expected to love every minute of it. Putting\
  \ so much time and effort into researching Thailand gave me a lot of pre-departure\
  \ expectations - most of which ended up being true. I felt like I knew what my trip\
  \ would be like before arriving, but no amount of research could prepare me for\
  \ the scope of everything I experienced.\n\nI had the opportunity to be blessed\
  \ by a monk and receive a good luck bracelet - which I still wear to this day. I\
  \ kayaked in the middle of a thunderstorm in Khao Sok. I fed watermelon to the monkeys\
  \ on Monkey Beach in Koh Phi Phi and discovered how gentle they are when one of\
  \ the babies climbed on my shoulder. I watched a million different types of sunsets\
  \ outside my bungalow in Koh Phangan. I was taught how to interact with the locals\
  \ by speaking key phrases in Thai. I watched fire dancers move with a gracefulness\
  \ I could only dream of. I met individuals from all over the world - travelers,\
  \ just like me. I didn't expect to experience most of these things, but they are\
  \ the moments that stand out most vividly in my mind. I didn't expect to fall in\
  \ love with the way life is lived in this corner of the world. Most of all, I didn't\
  \ expect to find a home. \n\nIt sounds cheesy, I realize, but Thailand and the rest\
  \ of Southeast Asia has called to me each and every day since I've left. My heart\
  \ fills every time I think about the days I spent walking along the white beaches\
  \ watching the palm fronds sway in the breeze. My breath catches when I remember\
  \ how happy I was to be in paradise - to live and experience things that I never\
  \ could back in the States. Sure, my head is often here with me, stuck in the monotony\
  \ of normal life, but my heart remains back in Bangkok, Khao Sok, Koh Phangan, Koh\
  \ Phi Phi. And I know someday it'll bring me home."
