Text: "My mom brought up the idea of a mother daughter get away in Cuba which sounded\
  \ amazing. I had never been to Cuba before so of course I wanted to experience what\
  \ the Cuban culture had to offer. I knew it was going to be hot but I wasn't prepared\
  \ just how hot it really was going to be. When I took my first steps off the plane\
  \ and my skin greeted the Cuban sun I was ready to seek air conditioning. I guess\
  \ the luxury of living in Canada with a significant cooler climate  gave my body\
  \ a shock. \n\nBut that's ok. It was going to be a great trip! I was there with\
  \ my mom and my sister, it would be amazing even if I was sweating off pounds by\
  \ the minute. The very least I'd be lighter when I went home. The customs process\
  \ and drive to the resort was painless. The guide on our bus was funny and gave\
  \ us a lot of information. On the short bus ride to our resort I was amazed at the\
  \ different plant life, people hitch hiking along the road, and an abandoned resort.\
  \ The explorer and photographer in me wanted to get a better look but I decided\
  \ getting arrested for trespassing while in Cuba probably wasn't the best idea.\
  \ \n\nWhen we reached the resort we were greeted by an amazing view of the ocean.\
  \ I had never seen water that colour before, it was stunning. You know that cliche\
  \ when people say their breath was taken away? Well mine really was. Maybe it was\
  \ the humidity but I'm pretty sure it was the view. I'm really excited now and can't\
  \ wait to get to our room so we can leave our things and go swim in the ocean. While\
  \ I was taking in the view mom was checking us in and came back looking slightly\
  \ annoyed. Our room wasn't ready. Hey that's ok! We can go get a drink and sit at\
  \ the bar. An hour or so passes and we check again. Still not ready. Hmm, ok that\
  \ is kind of annoying but we're in Cuba, I have a drink in my hand and there isn't\
  \ snow on the ground. It's fine, it will be fine. \n\nIt took a little over 4 hrs\
  \ to finally get in our room. After traveling all day it would have been nice if\
  \ our room was available at least within an hour of us getting there. That was the\
  \ first hiccup that started our relaxing week into a slightly stressful one. We\
  \ had a massive ant issue in the hotel room, it was hard to find seating for the\
  \ pool or when dinning, they ran out of towels, they ran out of money to do exchanges,\
  \ the line to reserve your supper was a good 2-3 hr wait, people were allowed to\
  \ smoke where ever they wanted out side, the beach was dirty.  I honestly think\
  \ the beach is what disturbed me the most. Especially being an animal lover when\
  \ I see hundreds of straws, plastic, netting, and other garbage on the beach all\
  \ I can think of is the marine life that is going to ingest that. \n\nSo on my vacation\
  \ I spent time cleaning up their beach. They didn't have garbage bins on the beach\
  \ so I had to make trips to the nearest bar and give them the garbage. I'm pretty\
  \ sure they thought I was crazy. But I felt better about myself which was all that\
  \ mattered. Even though all the issues were quite stressful and quite a few of the\
  \ staff were rude I knew they were probably stressed out too. They had just reopened\
  \ after suffering a massive blow from the string of Hurricanes only 6 months ago.\
  \ So in fairness they most likely weren't ready to open but rushed it anyways. \n\
  \nIt was an interesting experience. I'm not sure if I would go back to Cuba as I\
  \ would like to visit as many places as I can. But if you do visit and go to the\
  \ Pullman resort on Cayo Coco hopefully you will have a better experience."
