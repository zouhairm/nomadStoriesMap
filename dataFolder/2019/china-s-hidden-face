Text: "My first smog-choked glimpse of the world\u2019s oldest continuous civilization,\
  \ through the hazy windows of the descending plane, left me with more than a few\
  \ doubts about how I was going to survive the next few months. I stepped from the\
  \ confines of the plane and into the smoked glass and polished aluminium airport,\
  \ and realized for the first time in my life I could stare directly at the sun in\
  \ the middle of the day and not go immediately blind. I had little time to ponder\
  \ this fact though as I was immediately buffeted by the mass of humanity rushing\
  \ in their own desperation to make the next flight and, coming from a country with\
  \ a similar land mass but whose entire population could fit into this country\u2019\
  s capital cities, I was more than a little overwhelmed. \nI was to spend two months\
  \ in China, as part of a language program, but the culture shock of that first day\
  \ had me reeling. However, the next day, after a fitful sleep dreaming of oppressive\
  \ crowds and hazy, smoke-filled horizons, I steeled myself and leapt into the culture\
  \ I had come so far to see; and boy am I glad I did, for beneath the decades of\
  \ modern development and hasty mish-mash of urban sprawl, I found something in this\
  \ ancient land that I did not expect to find. \nRemoved from the world, hiding behind\
  \ the face of futuristic development and the pressures of unparalleled population\
  \ growth, China reveals a side of beauty. Amidst much doubt of the country, I soon\
  \ found myself in awe of its breathtaking history; face-to-face with the longest\
  \ wall known to man, The Great Wall of China left me speechless. Here I was, standing\
  \ on a tiny section, part of over 21,000 kilometres of architectural wonder, a space\
  \ that had spanned time itself, seen emperors and dynasties alike rise and fall,\
  \ and become one of the greatest man-made wonders of the world. It was a snap-shot\
  \ of a land before time, something I had not expected to find in a world so focused\
  \ on the future. \nThe further afield I journeyed, the more unexpected rewards I\
  \ found; mountains topped with temples that time forgot, towns that floated in a\
  \ languorous state \u2013 far removed from the pressure of modern society, ancient\
  \ forts and a past filled with some of the greatest and revered philosophers of\
  \ all time. \nPerhaps the greatest surprise I encountered in China was the cuisine;\
  \ before my journey to this vast land, I was NOT a fan of Chinese food. But what\
  \ do you get when you combine huge geographical variations, cultural differences\
  \ across a vast land, and roughly 1.4 billion mouths to feed? You get an explosion\
  \ of diversely weird and wonderful concoctions that are sure to challenge and treat\
  \ your taste buds in ways you could never have imagined. From the famous Peking\
  \ duck in Beijing to shredded pork buns or street market noodles, spicy fare, dim\
  \ sum trolleys, or the ever surprising ingredients of Sichuan Province markets,\
  \ there is something for any sceptical traveller around every corner. Follow your\
  \ nose across this land and be rewarded handsomely. \nAs my time in this diverse\
  \ country drew to a close, I found myself more than a little disappointed. I had\
  \ discovered only a fraction of this country\u2019s immense treasure trove of hidden\
  \ beauties, tasted only a crumb of its delicious and downright outrageous fare,\
  \ seen only the tip of its iceberg of natural wonders, and experienced only a sprinkle\
  \ of its wildly differing dialects and ethnic mix of compelling and fascinating\
  \ people. I went to China expecting nothing more than to learn the language and\
  \ pass my tests, but instead became so profoundly intertwined in the alluring culture,\
  \ history and wonder of this grand country, that I felt like I had found a second\
  \ home, and that was indeed something I did not expect to find."
