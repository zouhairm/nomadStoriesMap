Text: "Once upon a time I went to Colombia and I met a beautiful California girl at\
  \ the hostel. I never expected that she wanted to ask me if I could be her Valentine\
  \ and her boyfriend. We were walking throught the streets of Bogota, the capital\
  \ of the country and the world\xB4s capital of emeralds when a motorcycle started\
  \ shooting at some ladies. They were fine but they robbed their backpack with dozens\
  \ of emeralds worth half a million dollars. Ten minutes after that, national teleision\
  \ broadcasted the evening news and I was inteviewed as a witness. The bodyguards\
  \ of the owner of the emeralds asked me if I saw the mugglers\xB4 faces. They said\
  \ they ran an office of professional hitmen in the area, but that now they offer\
  \ their services as bodyguards for the zar of emeralds.  Kelly and I came back to\
  \ our hostel, she packed her luggage, and I took her to the train station. After\
  \ 5 minutes of hugging and kissing, we both cried and said goodbye.\n\nWhen I cam\
  \ back to my room she had left her mother\xB4s wedding ring. Her mother have died\
  \ of cancer a few years ago. Her letter said \"Come to California where we will\
  \ live happily ever after\". I went to California to meet her father Sean Connolly,\
  \ and Kelly and I decided to go to Europe for two weeks. We went to Istambul, Budapest,\
  \ Amsterdam, and Berlin. She experienced for the first time in her life an orgasm\
  \ at a Budapest hostel. She had absynth, and local drinks, and amazing food in Turkey.\
  \ We stayed in a barrel room at Lubbenau, Germany. The owner of the hotel was super\
  \ nice and he builds barrels of the size of a van, where you have a double bed,\
  \ a table, and storage. Very cool. We stayed at camper trucks in Amsterdam. We stayed\
  \ in Prague with a group of ladies that were kindergarten teachers but they would\
  \ go party every Thursday as a girls night. They would get crazy, and take of their\
  \ clothes at midnight.\n\nWe came back to California, and Kelly and myself bought\
  \ an RV, or camper trailer. We lived for three months, and we drove all the way\
  \ up to the vineyards of the Napa and Sonoma Valley. All of a sudden I asked Kelly\
  \ if she will marry me, and she said yes. We got married in Santa Rosa California\
  \ where we had a simple ceremony at the courthouse. We decided I was going to ask\
  \ for permanent residency, and she agreed upon that. All of a sudden, she was turning\
  \ into a neurotic and aggressive person. She admitted that she was a drug addict.\
  \ She was a nurse, and she would steal from the hospital unclaimed opioids, tranquilizers,and\
  \ she had PTSD (post traumatic disorder) from her years serving her country in the\
  \ army. I supported her, and told her to see a counsellor and talk about rehab.\
  \ I trusted her, and I knew that she could easily overcome this incident.\n\nThe\
  \ day we were going to file and sign the permanent residency she was distant. She\
  \ said she did not wanted to continue with our marriage, and that I should go back\
  \ to my country. She just said I will take you to the airport. I was basically kicked\
  \ out wih no chance to stay in California and find a place. I had no legal simmigration\
  \ status, so I had to book a flight. My brother paid for that flight, and 48 hours\
  \ later I was in my parents house, heartbroken, and without my wife Kelly, sunny\
  \ California dreams, no job, no assets, no income, and with a divorce paperwork\
  \ yet to be done. Six months later, I want to go to Portugal, because last time\
  \ I book a flight to Portugal I lost my flight because Ryan Air sold to many seats,\
  \ but it is my dream to go visit the virgin of FATIMA. I promised my mother before\
  \ she died of cancer, that I would visit FATIMA one day. It is a promise because\
  \ FATIMA was her favorite, and is in my bucketlist. The End."
