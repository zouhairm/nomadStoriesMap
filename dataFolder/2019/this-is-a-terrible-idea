Text: "\u201CHow have we ended up here? Where the hell even are we? We have four days\
  \ to reach Morocco and we\u2019ve wasted half a day just going west!\u201D In a\
  \ similar vein I went on, wasting precious minutes ranting away, with only the slightest\
  \ hint of humour, at my best and most trusted friend as we stood helplessly in the\
  \ middle of a roundabout on the outskirts of Caen. Caen is a French city, in Normandy,\
  \ nearly 2000km away from Morocco, our destination. It was lunchtime, everywhere\
  \ was closed, and we\u2019d started our day in Le Havre, 90km away. \n\u201CCan\u2019\
  t we find a station and take the train?\u201D This was a ludicrous suggestion, we\
  \ had about 200 euros between us, to last us 8 days, food, accommodation, and transport\
  \ to Marrakech, departure point of our flight home to uni and exams. It was not\
  \ enough that we\u2019d decided to trip through Europe at the back end of an Easter\
  \ break with make-or-break second year tests sneering over the horizon, we\u2019\
  d decided to hitchhike, moreover, to hitchhike for charity. So now we were trapped,\
  \ trapped with this monumental task, moral obligation, and not a car in sight to\
  \ take us any direction at all.\nIt was hopeless. My friend wasn\u2019t fazed.\n\
  \u201CNah, we\u2019ve got loads of time, we only need one car; besides, it\u2019\
  s a nice spot here.\u201D We were surrounded by an industrial estate. \nI\u2019\
  d always been a laid back character, \u2018horizontal\u2019 an accurate description,\
  \ but engaging strangers in a tongue I could barely speak enquiring if I could \u201C\
  get into their car and go wherever they were going\u201D had brought out a nervous\
  \ wreck in me that I\u2019d never realised lurked beneath the calm, perennially\
  \ napping exterior I\u2019d so happily cultivated. As I kicked off about the stupidity\
  \ of our idea and the virtues of cheating on our sponsored challenge to get free\
  \ passage through Europe, my friend studiously ignored me and kept his thumb out\
  \ to any vehicle that passed, including a bemused cyclist, who graciously indicated\
  \ that he had no space for the both of us on his machine. I was out of my depth\
  \ and panicking, holding my thumb out with a sign shouting \u2018Sud s.v.p.,\u2019\
  \ felt useless, the 500km a day target we\u2019d set ourselves as \u2018easy\u2019\
  \ was out the window. Neither of us had ever tried to hitch a lift before this day,\
  \ and with 90km covered in 6 hours, well. \nMy partner was chipper, his hat was\
  \ askew, and my hat was too, as he danced to a beat, whilst I clutched my brow.\
  \ An hour had passed of being emphatically ignored, my thoughts turned to sport,\
  \ and the art of the cheat. A small blue Citroen Saxo tooted at us as it rattled\
  \ round the roundabout, my mate laughed and waved. I smiled tight-lipped, like one\
  \ condemned. \n\u201CWait, look! He\u2019s stopped! My mate had looked behind us\
  \ and was pointing up the road, the Saxo was pulled over, hazards flashing. Through\
  \ my head flashed thoughts of my own, I\u2019d get to the window and the car would\
  \ speed off, but I gritted my teeth and jogged to the car. To my surprise, the driver\
  \ got out and opened his boot, beckoning us to hurry. If this was a wind-up, he\u2019\
  d earned a reaction, we sprinted to him, exchanging greetings and shouted \u201C\
  Sud?\u201D\n\u201COui, ce soir Clermont-Ferrand,\u201D he repeated, carefully arranging\
  \ his leather jacket over the driver\u2019s seat of his car as we piled into the\
  \ back amongst horse tack and silks, a racing jockey by trade, and a long range\
  \ traveller by necessity, one hoped. \nI pulled out our road map, and scanned down\
  \ the page for Clermont\u2026we couldn\u2019t see it, was it a village? We asked\
  \ our host again,\n\u201CYes, Clermont-Ferrand, it is about, 5\u20266 hundred kilometres.\u201D\
  \ I looked to my friend, he said it all with a grin; and when we stood on the ferry\
  \ from Gibraltar 3 days later, watching Morocco and Tangier hove into view, that\
  \ grin having never left his face, he turned to me, \n\u201CWhat did you once say\
  \ this was, Seb?\u201D\nMy own grin just as wide, I replied, \n\u201CThat this was\
  \ a terrible idea!\u201D"
