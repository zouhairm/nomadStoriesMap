Text: "Florida has a strange familiarity. \nWith its attraction and allure, the promise\
  \ of happiness, miles of coastline and clear blue skies.\n\nI was visiting family\
  \ in Jacksonville, the largest city in the state, and spent a few days catching\
  \ riveting sunsets on the beach, followed by a couple of drinks at The Flying Iguana.\
  \ As my inner explorer nudged me, I drove down to St Augustine\u2019s a bunch and\
  \ found myself strolling the shores and submerging in the culture of America\u2019\
  s oldest town.\n\nBy now the sunshine state had lured me. Palm trees, white sands,\
  \ lush golf courses, art-adorned walls, lavish holiday homes - what's not to like?\
  \ At the end of the week, I canceled my flights and extended my stay, determined\
  \ to seep in this slice of the south. \n\nMy next stop: The Homosassa Springs State\
  \ Park. It was the season for manatees to flock the springs, and I couldn\u2019\
  t wait to meet them. Driving through the heartlands revealed a different Florida\
  \ than the one we\u2019re so fixated on. Farmlands and Spanish moss lined the highway\
  \ for miles, only disturbed by billboards either announcing nearby adult stores\
  \ or advertising God's love as a reassurance of faith. Homosassa was a blissful\
  \ blend of bizarre and beautiful. I rented a boat from a shack near a trailer park\
  \ named \u201CRedneck Kayaks\u201D and felt some southern hospitality immediately.\
  \ The host handed me a local beer and inquired where I was from, taking a labored\
  \ drag of his American Spirit. I spent the next few days kayaking, exploring breathtaking\
  \ views, crystal clear waters, hidden caves, and spotting manatees - perhaps my\
  \ most exquisite experience in nature!\n\nAt the close of the week, I headed south.\
  \ As I drove into Tampa the gothic moss was replaced by hand-planted palms. Fascinated\
  \ by Ybor, I often walked the cobbled streets listening to James Dean on repeat\
  \  - occasionally enjoying a Cubano and beer accompanied by a local hand-rolled\
  \ stogie. Just south of Tampa is home to the world\u2019s largest shuffleboard club,\
  \ which is also next to the country\u2019s oldest greyhound track. With the mix\
  \ of relaxed and rusty, a welcoming historic district and more spotless beaches\
  \ - St Pete's, is a reminder of Florida that Americans dream of escaping to!\n\n\
  In a country filled with contradictions, Florida seemed like a place where all of\
  \ America could laugh. But a shade of sorrow hung under the sunshine - lending a\
  \ vibe that maybe Florida is laughing at itself. Because really, it feels bad.\n\
  \nOn my way east, I made the mandatory stop at Disneyland. Orlando was a contrast\
  \ of factions. On one hand, smiling tourists documenting memories, and locals doing\
  \ mundane chores on the other. Outside a bar in Kissimmee, a homeless man asked\
  \ me for change. I didn\u2019t have any but engaged him in conversation. He was\
  \ going south. \u201CIt okay but the cops here no good, we roll better in Miami,\u201D\
  \ he said.\_\n\nIronically I was heading the same direction.\n\nDriving on the I\
  \ 95, I happened to stop for a meal at a diner in Belle Glade, a town I'd never\
  \ heard of. As I sipped my PBR, the local newscast played a story on how this village\
  \ was ravaged by HIV in the \u201980s, and how life goes on in the aftermath. Strikingly\
  \ enough, the town also had two nationally-reputed high school football teams. \n\
  \nDespite the notions about Florida, Miami sneakily escapes moral policing. Long\
  \ hailed as a cocaine capital thanks to pop culture, Miami also is home to painters,\
  \ musicians, and artists from around the globe. Currently, in the middle of a real\
  \ estate boom, rising sea levels don\u2019t bother them. For now, South Beach continues\
  \ to rage with neon lights and techno tracks.\n\nThe sunshine state shattered many\
  \ conceptions I had brought with me. Even as I strolled the breathtaking beaches\
  \ and watched the golden sunsets, I couldn\u2019t help but acknowledge that there\u2019\
  s much more to Florida than miles of coastline and clear blue skies. This is where\
  \ the ocean washes away our sins: drugs, disease, under the table deals, even adultery.\
  \ It\u2019s got a quality that captures the soul. Like an estranged lover - with\
  \ intrigue and fleeting desire. \nFlorida has a strange familiarity."
