Text: "Travelling has always been an important part of my everyday life. \nTo school.\
  \ To college. To work.\nI look forward to it as the interstice of transition \n\
  from one place to another, one role to another, one routine to another.  \n\nFrom\
  \ the student at a convent to the granddaughter of a religious Hindu woman. From\
  \ a student at a design institute to a volunteer at a learning farm. The travel\
  \ is where the different religions crossed paths, where the attire effortlessly\
  \ shifted from its aesthetic part time shift to the more functional job. I have\
  \ digested, synthesised, reflected, written, drawn, read and slept moving from one\
  \ place to another. Being a meticulous planner, I have never allowed myself the\
  \ leisure of time or inaction. The next meeting can be as soon as I can reach you\
  \ from here - is the usual way in which I plan my days. Hence, the travel is the\
  \ only time where I allow myself to take time, and not rush. \n\nI never realised\
  \ that traveling alone could be an extension of the interstice of my everyday travel.\
  \ Maheshwar is a small place, can-cover-on-foot-in-an-hour small place in India.\
  \ I was in Maheshwar to work on a project with the weaving community. As always\
  \ my trip was planned in such a way so that I could finish my work, meet a relative\
  \ in a nearby city and then get back to Delhi as soon as I could - for my next project.\
  \ The project plan had been worked out before I left for the village and we knew\
  \ what we were doing after I came back. The travel was not the work - it was to\
  \ help us to get from one point to another.\n\nFor everyone at home, at work and\
  \ in my own planner - I was travelling. \nDoing what I did everyday just for longer,\
  \ \nstarting where I started everyday just to a place that was further away,\nshifting\
  \ roles and jobs just at larger intervals.\n\nTravelling within Maheshwar was very\
  \ easy. I had a royal auto rickshaw which appeared anywhere at anytime whenever\
  \ I called. But after my first day, I switched to walking. That gave me the liberty\
  \ to walk within local stores and community areas instead of viewing the flat parallel\
  \ scenery from my auto windows. It is the same thing when you are looking outside\
  \ the train waiting for your station. The different posters, the different profiles\
  \ at different stations until you get down and merge into the one where you participate\
  \ and become a part of the environment. \n\nFor the Maheshwar weavers work is a\
  \ part of their life - not their life. I had to change my ways and pace to be able\
  \ to be a passenger on their daily journeys. I was informed that the workshop opens\
  \ at 11 in the morning by the supervisor. I didn't realise what he didn't mean when\
  \ he said this is that the work doesn't begin at 11 or even 11:30. It begins when\
  \ the weavers arrive, like the station that remains open and the train that arrives\
  \ according to their set charts, and the independent traveler who comes when he\
  \ wills.\n\nMy three days in the Maheshwar felt like an extension of my everyday\
  \ travel but without the restriction of the fixed stations. In Maheshwar I drew\
  \ my own paths from the hotel to the workshop everyday - one day via the river;\
  \ the other through the market. I also spent as long as I wanted on the different\
  \ stops of my route, as no train gates were closing on me. I was allowed to eat\
  \ and drink on my way and there was no last train. \n\nA plane, car, auto, boat\
  \ and foot were all the different modes of transport I used for my travel to and\
  \ from Maheshwar. Where like my daily travel I started from point A, and while on\
  \ it chatted with strangers, made friends, peeped through other people's books,\
  \ spent a lot of time just looking, read, slept, introspected, got work done, called\
  \ old friends, made discoveries, shopped, bumped into relatives, prayed, made lists,\
  \ and eventually got to point B. And back. \nTo repeat. \n\nAll in the labor of\
  \ travel."
