Text: "The sound of the train follows regularly dreary sleepy .. From the closed window\
  \ seems endless white plains stretching in all directions .. Plains covered with\
  \ snow covered .. And the sky covered with clouds thick gray ..!\n\nThe sight of\
  \ the snow makes me feel cold. So I close the coat around my body. I cover my hands\
  \ in front of my mouth. I slowly blow for warmth.\n\n\nTake out a magazine from\
  \ the magazine, but I'm bored. Take out a small notebook . .. Write two words (snow\
  \ plains .. and in the spirit of Jamr) .,  close the notebook.\nLet me sleep a little\n\
  Look at the window. The tail of the train seems to be wriggling across the vast\
  \ snowy plains.\nI close my eyes .. I listen to the sound of the train .. Slowly\
  \ absent the white plains .. And miss the voice of the train\n\nThe sun is shining\
  \ this morning .. And here I am walking in the university slowly among the groups\
  \ of students .. Trees look shiny and fresh .. Sit on a long wooden seat .. Minutes\
  \ .. Then come here speeding look here and there with beautiful eyes .. !!\n\nI\
  \ deliberately stay,\nI follow it\nshe.. Says:\n\n\n- sorry .. delayed you ..!\n\
  \nShe wore a  woolen hat that looked like a child's hat.\n\nHe smiled and stretched\
  \ out my hand shaking hands and said: - Tired on you ..!\n\n\n- Do not be afraid\
  \ .. I like cats with seven souls ..!\n\nLaugh and say: - But six .. Do not forget\
  \ that you survived the death miraculously a week ago ..\nWe sit together\n\_are\
  \ you feeling cold ??\n\n\n- Yes .. The atmosphere is cool with the sun shining\
  \ ..! Then I continued: - But I love this weather .. Everything is clean and washed\
  \ with rain\nStudents go and come\n\_We walk together towards the coffee stall.\
  \ Ask for two cups of coffee with milk.\nHere, what do you tell me?\n\nLook at her\
  \ eyes and say: _ Student Council elections will be held on time .. And you will\
  \ be in our list ..!\n\n\n- I ?!\n\n\n- Yes you .. You do not lack activity and\
  \ experience .. .. You will get the highest votes ..\n\nShe smiles miserably and\
  \ says, \"Who is everyone?\"\n\nLook at it seriously and say: - But it will not\
  \ be easy .. Elections will be fierce .. And if we win .. You will be in the center\
  \ of events .. ready?\n\nSuddenly, I noticed the whistle of the train. I opened\
  \ my eyes. The train slowed down, and from the closed glass window an old station\
  \ stood on the pavement.\nClose my eyes again .. And the train will miss little..\n\
  \ The buildings have many flags and many signs written in a clear and clear line\n\
  \n(The day of the earth Khalid day in our history)\n\n(Blood of martyrs will not\
  \ go wasteful)\n\n(I carried my head to carry the generations after us)\n\nShouts\
  \ coming from all sides . Israeli tanks are seen encircling the entrances of the\
  \ university\n\nI stood on a high platform .. I held the loudspeaker in my hand.\
  \ She was standing beside me shouting with great enthusiasm.\n\nThe door of the\
  \ train compartment opens up a source of high sound .. Watch out and open my eyes\
  \ .. A man looks at me and says in the language of the country: - Sorry .. Look\
  \ for my friend ..! .. Then closed the door and went on\n\_From the window the evening\
  \ was approaching\nThe interrogation room is dark .. A deep painful numbness penetrates\
  \ like a knife in my shoulder .. I am hanging from my hands in the ceiling of the\
  \ room almost men Tlemcen land ..!\n\nThe voices of investigators arrive\n. But\
  \ I was singing in a low voice :\n\n\n- I came back from death to live .. and sing\n\
  I was trying hard to remember the rest of the poem .. But i can,t .. I  prevented\
  \ from sleeping 10 days ago ..!\n\nI wake up because The snow enters from the window\n\
  Close the window and sit on the seat .. Open the yellow lamp . Look for a pack of\
  \ cigarettes .. Turn on a cigarette and see from the window\n\n.. I remember how\
  \ you hugged me strongly and in front of everyone .. \n .. Remember how trembled\
  \ her lower lip and she says loudly and waving in her hand:\n\n\n- You are stronger\
  \ than exile.\nSoldiers take me away\n\n\n- We are stronger than death"
