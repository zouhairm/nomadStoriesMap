Text: "I found myself attached to Siwa after reading Bahaa Taher's Sunset Oasis; then\
  \ I watched the show based on the novel and I was completely hooked. I stumbled\
  \ upon a three-day trip to Siwa organized by a tour planner, but getting my parents'\
  \ approval was very difficult \u2013 the problem was that Siwa's pretty far and\
  \ I was going to travel alone. So I booked the trip and told them just a few days\
  \ before; arguments and fights aside, they reluctantly agreed. For me, I was excited;\
  \ I like to travel alone and love seeing new places and meeting new people. \n\n\
  WHAT TO DO IN SIWA\n\nSafari\n\nYou haven\u2019t really been to Siwa if you don\u2019\
  t go on a safari in the Great Sand Sea. Make sure to bring a shawl or a scarf and\
  \ sunglasses, to protect your face and eyes from the sand; even then, you'll still\
  \ get covered in sand. Either way, it's an amazing experience to feel the car go\
  \ up the sand dunes and go down almost vertically.\n\nOld Shali Fort\nThis is one\
  \ of Siwa's most famous landmarks, and it\u2019s right in the heart of the oasis.\
  \ It was built by the people of Siwa to protect themselves from neighboring tribes\
  \ who tried to raid them come harvest season every year, and it was inhabited up\
  \ until 1926. All the structures are made of karshif, like most homes in Siwa; karshif\
  \ is a building material made of salt with clay, which helps the houses remain cool\
  \ in summer and warm in winter. \n\nSalt Lakes\nSiwa's salt lakes have a very high\
  \ concentration of salt, which makes it really easy to swim there; plus, the water\
  \ is beautiful and crystal clear. The salt produced from these lakes is considered\
  \ some of the purest in the world, and it also has therapeutic qualities.\n\nFatnas\
  \ Island\nSiwa is known as the sunset oasis because it\u2019s the last place the\
  \ sun sets in Egypt. Fatnas Island is considered the best place to watch that sunset.\n\
  \n You don't really need a car to see the rest of the sites in Siwa; you could use\
  \ just a bike, which you can rent from one of the many shops in the downtown area.\
  \ Riding bikes in itself is quite fun; I fell off while I was riding and happened\
  \ to be wearing a white dress, but I pressed on and kept riding.\n\nART AND CULTURE\
  \ IN SIWA\n\nI joined a Siwan gathering of music and dance while I was at Nour El\
  \ Waha Hotel \u2013 done by men, of course. It was hard to understand what they\
  \ were singing, but the ambience itself is very vibrant and fun. You'll also hear\
  \ Libyan songs due to the the influence of being situated so close to the Libyan\
  \ border.\n\nSiwans are also quite talented in handicrafts and rely on them as a\
  \ means of income. You\u2019ll find handmade Siwan outfits embroidered by the women\
  \ and girls of the oasis; you\u2019ll also find kilim with very unique and colorful\
  \ designs, silver accessories, and salt lamps that are said to absorb negative energy.\
  \ Siwa isalso very well known for olive and palm products, which you can buy from\
  \ almost anywhere in Siwa.\n\nSiwan women don't go out often, and will be wearing\
  \ a loose black or tanned abaya with a burqa if they do. Their attire is different\
  \ than the abayas and burqas found elsewhere in Egypt \u2013 their eyes barely show,\
  \ and there's a dark, striped blanket covering any body features. Only young girls\
  \ up to 12 years old will be seen with their faces uncovered. On the other hand,\
  \ men wear galabeyas with pants underneath, similar to the traditional attire of\
  \ Libya.\n\nI expected Siwa to be different than what I read in Sunset Oasis because\
  \ the events took place in the days of the English occupation, but I was surprised\
  \ to find that there wasn\u2019t much difference. They\u2019re a conservative society\
  \ that's maintained its traditions, language, and legacy throughout the years, but\
  \ they're not an isolated society; the people are very welcoming, so it's easy to\
  \ integrate there. \n\nPart of my trip to Siwa in 2018\n\nhttp://www.safareya.com/En/SafareyaStories/Exploring-Sunset-Oasis-SIwa?fbclid=IwAR2_kwney7aVUds468_qnI9StD3jPOFtDchtl0Db1RAROLJAHLnTtWTFu-0"
