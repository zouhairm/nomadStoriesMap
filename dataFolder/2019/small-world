Text: 'So much of what we are, is where we have been.

  Having loved places with few people and places not much crowded, a solitude lover
  and solo-travelling, I never expected that i will find myself one day sitting at
  Times Square, sipping coffee and crying because I was leaving the same evening and
  that I had started loving this city so much and that I had a new favourite city.
  This is the city where you can find people from every ethnic group, every country,
  every color and speaking almost every language in the world. Sitting at a bench
  there, an old man, a native of my country happened to see me and ask me why I was
  cryingvand do I want any help. I thanked him for his good gesture and politely refused
  his help. After talking to him for a short time he told me that he owns a company
  here at times square and he has an office here. So I just realised that I met a
  very famous Millionaire from my country thousands of miles away offering me help.
  Apart from this, throughout my 2 months of back-packing and Volunteering in the
  USA, I happened to meet a lot of people who had a lot to share and I got to learn
  something from everyone I met. And I realised we are all not much different from
  each other and that the whole world cares for each other no matter what the nationality,
  color, caste, religion, etc. This is why I am always motivated to travel.

  This was my short travel story.'
