Text: "It was early November and I was about to have a 3 months vacation. I was wondering\
  \ what could I do to enjoy it when my aunt came to me with the idea of an exchange\
  \ program. I was like \"There's no time to plan that, it's too late. I should have\
  \ thought about that before\", but then I decided to do it anyway. Little did I\
  \ know that I was about to live one of the best experiences of my life.\n\nWould\
  \ you believe if I tell you that before November 2016, I didn't even know that Malta\
  \ was a country? I mean, I'd heard about the Maltese Cross but I never thought that\
  \ Malta really exists until the company I hired to plan the exchange told me about\
  \ it. So I googled it and I started to fall in love with Malta just through the\
  \ pictures.\n\nBefore telling you about what a month in Malta did to me, you need\
  \ to know a little bit about who I used to be before that. Shy, not confident, not\
  \ talkative, afraid of the unknown. That was me! So, how could a person with these\
  \ attributes survive to a month in a totally different culture? I made it and I\
  \ will tell you how.\n\nFirst of all, I knew I had to put my shyness and fear of\
  \ making mistakes aside and start to talk in English, even because the Maltese people\
  \ speak English, Maltese and, some of them, Italian, so I had no choice, but to\
  \ speak in English. I was lucky because they are very friendly and helpful, so if\
  \ I needed some help, I knew that anyone would try to help me. \n\nI stayed in a\
  \ house in St. Julians with 5 other girls of different nationalities. Brazil, Italy,\
  \ Japan, and South Korea, so, as you can see, I had so much to learn just inside\
  \ the house and I couldn't let those attributes get in the way of this discovery.\
  \ \nI studied English at Ace School and I couldn't choose better. The school had\
  \ a full schedule so you would have something to do every day. Conversations and\
  \ welcome parties on Mondays, get to know Malta on Tuesdays and Thursdays, parties\
  \ or bowling on Wednesdays, farewell parties on Fridays and some activities on Saturdays\
  \ and Sundays. So you won't get bored! I'm not a party person and usually, I prefer\
  \ to stay at home, but I went to almost all the activities and I loved it. I've\
  \ met a lot of friendly and interesting people from all over the globe and the most\
  \ important is that I keep in touch with some of them till today. I've made some\
  \ true friendships, that by the way I really miss. I've met some beautiful places\
  \ and I also took some great pics. I did everything I wanted to, but what exactly\
  \ did Malta do to me?\n\nI usually say that every place you go, depending on the\
  \ person who is with you or even the food you eat, is a completely different experience.\
  \ Each new experience has something to add to your life. And Malta has helped me\
  \ to realize what I can lose if I hide behind shame and fear. \nBefore I didn't\
  \ even know that Malta existed and I was going there to make a new discovery but,\
  \ in fact, it was Malta that helped me to discover a part of me that I didn't know."
