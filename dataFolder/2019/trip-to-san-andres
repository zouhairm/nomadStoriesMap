Text: "My friend and I are from Brazil, but we were in Cartagena Colombia working\
  \ as teachers for a year. We didn't know each other previously, we just met there,\
  \ but had a strong connection, we're from the same state, and have much in common,\
  \ because of this we became good friends. \nWe really wanted to travel to San Andr\xE9\
  s, the most beautiful Caribbean Island in Colombia, but we didn't have much money,\
  \ because we were teachers after all. But we made some saves, booked a cheap place\
  \ to stay and bought our tickets flights to the dreamed San Andr\xE9s Island.\n\
  We had only 200 thousand pesos each, for five days. Even with little money we really\
  \ wanted to have fun, to visit the beaches and go to the parties, so we had to decide\
  \ smartly the best way to spend our money, and do all the things we wanted to do.\n\
  We got there, and at first went to the market to buy pasta, bread, and cheese. So\
  \ we would have food to eat at home and save money. We had the best trip of our\
  \ lives. We went to the most beautiful beaches on the island. The hostel we were,\
  \ had a bike, so we used it to go to the beaches, and don't spend money with transportations.\n\
  When we got at the hostel, the first person I met was a cute Danish guy, and he\
  \ introduced me to his friend from his country. The people at the hostel were all\
  \ from different places like one from Norway, some others from German, a Canadian\
  \ guy, an American, a Colombian, a girl from the Netherlands, and another girl from\
  \ French Guiana. This was awesome, all different cultures and languages at the same\
  \ house. We made some parties at the hostel, we went to the most famous disco from\
  \ the Island, we drunk a pina colada, and met so many great people from San Andres,\
  \ I even found a Danish summer love. \nThe Island is not big, so we had the opportunity\
  \ to go to all the beaches, dive with the fishies, and swim in the seven colored\
  \ sea. The ocean truly has seven different colors. \nOne day we took the bikes and\
  \ went to a reggae Island, this was my favorite one, in front of the beach there\
  \ is a small Island, and you can walk true the beach to get to the small Island.\
  \ There are some rocks that make the crossing easily. To go to the Island was a\
  \ piece of cake, very cool, my friend and I took a lot of pictures, we had an amazing\
  \ time there. But when we were coming back to the beach, started heavy rain, and\
  \ the sea started to become more strong and with a lot of strong waves. Lucky for\
  \ us, a boy from the Island took our hands and offered to help us to cross the sea.\
  \ We still alive, nothing happened, but I was so scared inside the water.\nThe last\
  \ day was raining a lot, and We spent the whole day at the hostel, doing drunken\
  \ games with our new friends, going to the beach to have a rain shower. At night\
  \ we all cooked together while we were drinking tequila. \nIn the day we came back\
  \ to Colombia was still raining a lot, the airport closed and all the mornings'\
  \ flights were canceled, so we spent the whole day sitting in the floor hamburger\
  \ waiting for the next plain to come back. Thank God we were able to be home at\
  \ night. We needed to have an adventure on our last day, to be unforgettable and\
  \ have a story to tell. \nThis was a wonderful trip because I met a lot of great\
  \ people, I got closer to my friend, I saw the most beautiful beaches of my life,\
  \ I had a summer love, lived too many adventures, and even with so little money\
  \ I had the best trip of my life!"
