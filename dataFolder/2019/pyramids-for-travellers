Text: "Ingrid Rodriguez is not the real name of my landlord during my time in Southern\
  \ France, but that\u2019s what I will call her for this story. She was originally\
  \ from Haiti, according to her passport, but she kept saying she was Jamaican. She\
  \ owned flats in Montpellier which she rented to Erasmus students. One of them was\
  \ me. We had arranged everything for my five months stay online - me from Germany,\
  \ her residing in San Francisco. I did not quite understand her living conditions,\
  \ but after almost falling for another offer that turned out as fraud, I was happy\
  \ to have found a room in Montpellier, not far from the main square \u201CPlace\
  \ de la Com\xE9die\u201D. \n\nThe day I arrived, Ingrid was not there. When I called\
  \ her, she blamed it on being jet-lagged and hence messing up the dates, and asked\
  \ me to ring at \u201CAnne Rimbert\u201D, who turned out be my very tiny and rather\
  \ old neighbor. Anne saved my pale skin from sitting on my suitcase, the air having\
  \ had 35\xB0C. I don\u2019t know how much that is in Fahrenheit, but it is a common\
  \ temperature for an afternoon in early September in the mediterranean area. So\
  \ yes, I was sweating. \n\nI was shown the apartment by Anne, who seemed to be in\
  \ charge for Ingrid\u2019s housing matters anyways. I was fairly impressed by a\
  \ palm tree in front of our bathroom window. Anne said Ingrid wanted to apologise\
  \ for this delay tomorrow by taking me to the beach. She would do that with all\
  \ of her tenants, and it would be her last week, and Anne would also be joining,\
  \ and I did not know any other person in this town, and the beach was a short car\
  \ ride away, and Ingrid had a car, so I agreed.\n\nAt my home university, I had\
  \ taken part in an introduction event for outgoing students. The city of Montpellier\
  \ had been presented as the 8th biggest city in France, the second biggest city\
  \ in the administrative region of Occitanie, and, finally, the capital of the departement\
  \ H\xE9rault. It has almost 300.000 inhabitants, amongst them more than 60.000 university\
  \ students, which, apparently, was a considerable amount. I remember trying hard\
  \ to be impressed. Seeing those dunes and the flawless blue sky from Ingrid\u2019\
  s Land Rover however, was an experience that some random rankings can\u2019t prepare\
  \ you for. There were no clouds, except some haze that would appear from time to\
  \ time, looking more like trickling sand, and which would fade from the wind the\
  \ longer you look at it. Ingrid and Anne were talking very much and very fast about\
  \ people they both knew and I didn\u2019t during the whole ride to La Grande Motte,\
  \ where we parked the car. In front of us was the Mediterranean Sea and, behind\
  \ it, the horizon; to our right was the coastline that consisted in a long beach\
  \ that would end not before the town of S\xE8te - basically, if you just kept walking,\
  \ you would eventually reach Spain in that direction. And to the left, we looked\
  \ at La Grande Motte. This is an artificial beach village that has been entirely\
  \ created in the 1960s by one single architect - Jean Balladur - responding to the\
  \ growing numbers of tourists in the region. At the time I went there with my fifty-year-old\
  \ Caribbean landlord Ingrid and my at least eighty-year-old French neighbour Anne,\
  \ I found this at first glance a somewhat odd place to visit. Jean Balladur designed\
  \ pyramid shaped buildings all in white that seemed timeless in the 1960ies, but\
  \ which from today\u2019s perspective can\u2019t negate that they stem from a certain\
  \ aesthetic context - a context from 60 years ago. Still, it\u2019s beautiful. I\
  \ understand its sense now better, after having seen what mass tourism - even when\
  \ it is considered as individual tourism, or \u2018travelling\u2019 - can do to\
  \ nature. In La Grande Motte, an originally swampy area was turned into an efficient\
  \ centre for people who wanted to enjoy their holidays at the seaside - and by that,\
  \ it achieved both democratising travelling and keeping the surrounding landscape\
  \ as unaffected as possible. If that is not impressing, I don\u2019t know what is."
