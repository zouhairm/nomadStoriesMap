Text: "Oaxaca a very delightful place, a piece of heaven on earth. This, is a state\
  \ from Mexico so vast and thrilling, every region, city, municipality and town.\
  \ Its people are so kind, lovely and gentil. To live here is a whole new experience,\
  \ every season of the year in thia state is like getting to know a different place.\
  \ There are always many \"Calendas\", for every occasion. The day of the dead (D\xED\
  a de los muertos) is one of the most important celebrations, I get chills of how\
  \ beautiful I see year threw year the way in every person decorates the \"altar\"\
  \ and make there offerings to there dead as a way to show them respect and love,\
  \ all of this during autumn. In winter all the streets and houses are full of joy\
  \ and hope because of the approach of the birth of Jesus and the new year. Oaxaca\
  \ celebrates one of the most important festivities of all the mexican republic,\
  \ \"La Guelaguetza\", this is one of the most emblematic party, full of music, food,\
  \ calendas, dances and singing. To be in Oaxaca is more than what you can expect,\
  \ because the more you get to know about it, the more you fall in love with this\
  \ beautiful state."
