Text: "Luci and I got in one of the classic cars from the 50s at the bus station,\
  \ on a bumpy ride, towards the first inner city we were going to visit in the island.\
  \ The driver didn\u2019t seem to be in a rush, but we soon arrived and saw Trinidad,\
  \ so small between the mountains and hills, so tiny that the city couldn\u2019t\
  \ reach the sea.\nWhen we stopped in front of a modest door that sure enough didn\u2019\
  t make justice to the real size of the house, we were welcomed with a smile and\
  \ a warm hug by Yoel, our host for the time being, as if we were old friends that\
  \ haven\u2019t seen each other for a long time. Stepping inside the house, I felt\
  \ the same nostalgia I had felt when I first arrived at the small airport of the\
  \ most famous island in America, that smell of antique, of space and time still,\
  \ the same I used to feel at my grandma\u2019s home. That feeling of entering a\
  \ time machine, ending up in the nostalgic 60s, as if the Cuban revolution had happened\
  \ yesterday.\nHelpfully, Yoel told us to seat and served us with an orange juice,\
  \ while saying how much he loved Brazil, that he had been to Bahia and enthusiastically\
  \ highlighted how much water we had in our country. He revealed that under his house\
  \ there was a swimming pool, which he had built to store the water that would only\
  \ come every four days, and began to talk about many other aspects of the city,\
  \ drawing clever parallels between Cuba, Brazil and the USA. That familiar contact,\
  \ eye to eye, and the critical sense of Cubans enraptured us, and we discussed politics,\
  \ economics, and cultural barriers. Time is different for them; the capitalist anxiety\
  \ wasn\u2019t tormenting us while we were there.\nThe next day, we decided to rent\
  \ two bikes to go to the sea, since we were curious to meet the Caribbean waters\
  \ for the first time. It was a Sunday and when we woke up, the windows of our room\
  \ were shaking with a restless wind. We went to see through the window, and it was\
  \ sunny, the sky was blue, but it was cold. Yoel told us, while serving us with\
  \ a royalty-worthy breakfast, that the wind was coming from Florida. Nevertheless,\
  \ we should go to the beach. We hopped on our bikes and went to Peninsula Anc\xF3\
  n. It was my first time riding on a highway. Along the way, we were caught by the\
  \ silence, the favourable wind, the astonishing view of the mountains, the desert-like\
  \ vegetation, and almost no cars. It felt like a black-and-white western movie.\n\
  It didn\u2019t take long, and we were facing the sea with a multitude of shades\
  \ of blue. We were flabbergasted with that paradise in front of us. There was no\
  \ one at the beach, and we stood there for hours, amongst the warm sea and the mountains.\
  \ We wanted to stay until sunset, but we had noticed that there were no light poles\
  \ on the highway, so we decided to go back.\nWe had a hard time coming back, because\
  \ now the wind was a wall that we needed to surpass. Since I\u2019m very thin, I\
  \ suffered the most. We saw the sun go down and Trinidad was far away, while our\
  \ legs were burning with the effort. Suddenly, I was thrown off my bike by the wind,\
  \ which made me fly for a few seconds and then I fell on the dry sand, injuring\
  \ myself a little. After that, we went back walking, because the wind was winning\
  \ the battle. I was afraid, trembling from the cold.\nFinally, the city drew near.\
  \ When we got to the old streets, the coloured sunset behind us was like a painting.\
  \ We took much longer to come back than to go, but I really felt like I was in a\
  \ time, which the speed of the clock is dictated by the swing of a rocking chair,\
  \ like the one I sat at Yoel\u2019s porch, in that evening, smoking a cigar and\
  \ drinking Daiquiris after the most intense day I would have in Cuba."
