Text: "People in the metro always look so sad and lonely.\n\"these things must be\
  \ confisticated at the driver's cabin\" joked the metro driver stepping out of his\
  \ cabin pointing at the cake my friend was holding while we were waiting for the\
  \ doors to open.\nSee the Cairene daily metro commute is not just a ride to take\
  \ you from point a to b, it's an experience, an adventure, it never gets old, boring,\
  \ and you never run out of things to say, there is always something to be shared\
  \ everyday, crossing the barriers of social class, education and connecting on the\
  \ purest humane level. \nThere are three metro lines connecting most regions of\
  \ greater Cairo together.\nOne station that has a special meaning for Egyptians,\
  \ is Sadaat station. Sadaat station is the station above which Tahrir square stands,\
  \ where the 25th of January revolution kindled, this station is one of the most\
  \ crowded since it's used to change between lines 1 and 2. It has been closed for\
  \ security reasons since the revolution several times, only to be opened for a few\
  \ days/weeks and then again closed whenever the slightest insecurity occurs a gazillion\
  \ lightyears away from the station, Egyptians known for their sense of humor, exploited\
  \ this to contribute to the large ongoing meme scene, in efforts to relieve the\
  \ pain into laughter.\n\nSpeaking of crowd, Order is not a word in our dictionary,\
  \ yet there's beauty in that everyday chaos. Like every metro, there are entrance\
  \ and exit doors, here both are used for both purposes, the stares people inside\
  \ and outside the doors share as the metro stops, waiting for their diffusion, resemble\
  \ those stares from that scene in Tim Burton's Charlie and the chocolate factory,\
  \ between the candy stores' workers and the children waiting for the doors to open\
  \ to buy as many Willy Wonka chocolate bars as possible.\nAs the doors open, the\
  \ adventure begins. Most of the time you won't find a place to stand still, that's\
  \ how crowded it always is, yet it's still full of hawkers selling everything, \"\
  treat yourself after a hard day's work, or your loved ones with this delicious chocolate\
  \ filled with strawberry cream, buy 3 for 5 LE\" shouted the teenage girl wearing\
  \ her scarf and abaya tiredly walking through the cart, \"strawberry cream you say\"\
  \ enquired a woman skeptically, \"well..\" smiled the girl, \"honestly, it's filled\
  \ with a tiny bit of strawberries, but it's really delicious, try it first and only\
  \ pay if you like it\", another shouts \"anyone wants the syrian hair removal sweet\
  \ girls, here is one sold, and here's another two, anyone else wants anything before\
  \ I leave in the next station\", these are usually the most common things you'd\
  \ hear on a daily basis, specially at the women's carts. But of course it's illegal\
  \ for hawkers to sell their goods in the metro, this is a scene that would be equally\
  \ beautiful to witness if you press a mute button and just observed the body language,\
  \ watched the silent laughs and glances the hawkers share as they warn each other\
  \ to hide whenever there's a cop inspecting the metro as it stops, the people covering\
  \ them up as they try to hide smiling those smiles that you and your siblings would\
  \ share whenever you're trying to hide something from your parents, the look of\
  \ relief when the doors close and the metro begins moving, the look of trust and\
  \ affirmation shared between the hawkers and some cops who let them sell their goods\
  \ freely, no words are needed to add to the beauty of these scenes. \nThe grand\
  \ exit scene, perhaps a scene that would leave you confused and understand how chaotic\
  \ we can be, is when people rush racing to the escalator with maximum energy before\
  \ they pile up waiting for their turn slowly squeezing through a tiny 1 meter-ish\
  \ wide area, why this would leave you preplexed, is that they could've used this\
  \ energy to climb up the stairs instead of cramming into such narrow area but this\
  \ is part of the beautiful chaos that seeps into the metro and is a final essential\
  \ part of its everyday's experience or in this case adventure!"
