Text: "It is amazing how the rain has always soothed me. Whether at night listening\
  \ to the drops tap my window, or during the day watching it collide with the wood\
  \ on my porch, the calm that would come over me was almost spiritual. Even in south\
  \ Vietnam, when I found myself in an entirely different world, I was pleasantly\
  \ reassured that rain fell the same there as it did at home.\n\nAmong the many beauties\
  \ of a new country over 8,000 miles away, was the informal introduction I had with\
  \ a local playful beast: monsoon season. During one of my lessons each day, the\
  \ rain announced its arrival by disturbing the green curtains that covered the open\
  \ classroom windows and acted as our air conditioning in the humid equatorial temperatures.\_\
  \n\nIn the three weeks that I called a rural Vietnamese town home, the others I\
  \ taught with and I deeply bonded with a seventh grade student we affectionately\
  \ called \u201CSandy\u201D. Immediately following the last day of school, we were\
  \ invited to visit Sandy\u2019s home for a farewell party. So, after last period\
  \ ended that day, Sandy led us, and what seemed like the rest of our eighty students,\
  \ to her home.\_\n\nTo get to her house, you must take a right past the school\u2019\
  s gate, follow the river down, and occasionally stop to play with the drudged clay\
  \ used to build houses. Once you reach a small fork in the road, bank left down\
  \ the lush hill, and cross the bridge to the other side of the river. There, if\
  \ a boat filled with obese swine scoot under you, form a peace sign with your hand\
  \ and exchange excited \u201Chi\u2019s\u201D.  After crossing the bridge, look for\
  \ your students to guide you through the rest of the marshy trees and soft pink\
  \ lotus flowers. Eventually, you'll arrive to a quaint one room house, no larger\
  \ than 500 square feet, where the rest of your friends and students have gathered.\_\
  \n\nOn arrival, we were given a tour of Sandy\u2019s home where she lived with her\
  \ grandparents. They watched over her while her parents lived and worked five hours\
  \ away in Ho Chi Minh City, sending money back to support them. A common arrangement\
  \ here. In our conversations with Sandy, she frequently mentioned how her love for\
  \ them made the distance difficult. Today, however, any indication of sadness in\
  \ her heart could not be found among the smiles that surrounded and emanated from\
  \ her.\_\n\nAfter being spotted by Sandy\u2019s grandmother, in true grandmother\
  \ fashion, whole chicken soup (I was given the foot), was immediately  placed in\
  \ my hands. As were seconds, even though I hadn't finished the first serving. While\
  \ crunching on the soup and leaning against the exposed wood porch, I studied the\
  \ children climb trees, play tag, and just simply live. The others sipped water\
  \ straight from coconuts, nibbled on dried candied coconut strips, and eventually\
  \ joined in the play as well. In those moments, we too were kids.\_\n\nWeaving through\
  \ the starfruit trees along the river trying to escape the tagger, the familiar\
  \ announcement of rain\u2019s breeze eventually caressed our face and the coaches\
  \ made their way to the awning to take shelter. However, after watching the children\
  \ continue their fun and feeling the weight of our final hours together come over\
  \ us, we decided to join the students\u2019 innocent dancing out in the rain.\_\n\
  \nIn my final dance with Sandy, seeing the rest of the children gradually hop on\
  \ their bicycles and return home, waving us all goodbye, I blissfully looked up\
  \ to the sky as the water kissed my face. As if the rain could hear my thoughts,\
  \ I thanked it for again bringing me an ethereal appreciation for a moment now gone,\
  \ and permanently washing away the egotistical, war-obsessed American view of Vietnam\
  \ that I initially had.\_\n\nGiving Sandy one last twirl, I looked into her sweet\
  \ twelve year old brown eyes and thought of everyone I met and everything I experienced\
  \ while in Vietnam, realizing how blessed I was to have been able to see the soul\
  \ of this beautiful country, and to have the opportunity to celebrate it by dancing\
  \ in the rain with her."
