Text: "While I waited for the winter to go a little easy on us, the mountains in Darjeeling,\
  \ my hometown just didn't give those signs. It was one of those days when it struck\
  \ me. A solo backpacking trip to Bhutan. Without much delay I impulsively set off\
  \ for the journey the following day. One of the most radical decisions I had ever\
  \ made. \nWithout knowing anything much about Bhutan, I found myself almost near\
  \ the India - Bhutan border the next moment. While on the journey, I tried to network\
  \ with a long lost school friend of mine Sonam Tobgay (lovingly called Tobgay),\
  \  knowing well enough that no one would instantly reply to a message on facebook.\
  \ \nOnce I reached Phuentsholing, I was enlightened by the border police there that\
  \ I'd require a travel permit to go further into Bhutan or else I have to find my\
  \ way back home. I went to the permit office and then I discovered that its more\
  \ difficult for a solo traveller to get a travel permit than those travelling with\
  \ a band of folks. Basically I was denied. \nThere were two way out from this problem:\
  \ either I could wait outside the office, tag along with a travelling group and\
  \ make my way into the country or have someone from Bhutan invite me over. The luck\
  \ was not at my favour for both of the ways until just when my long lost friend,\
  \ Tobgay replied to me. That was when it all changed. He sent an invitation email\
  \ and there I was was - in a van that was now ready to head inside the Land of the\
  \ Thunder Dragon. \nWith almost five hours of journey through the mountains, I dropped\
  \ at a departmental store along the highway where Tobgay would come and pick me.\
  \ He was already there. The moment I met him, I was overwhelmed by nostalgia. He\
  \ seemed to have been too. \nFor the next week he sheltered me at his home. Ate\
  \ traditional cuisines made by his loving mother everyday with \"suja\" (butter\
  \ tea) at the end of each meal. During the stay there, we visited the famous Taksang\
  \ Monastry (Tiger's nest) dressed as nationals where we greeted almost all the monks\
  \ with the only words I had learned - \"Kuzuzangpo La!\" (hello!) and were greeted\
  \ back with almost double the love. One day, we went cycling to a hilltop at Thimphu.\
  \ However, having started terribly late for the tour, returning home in the total\
  \ darkness was an adventure of its own kind. We met some locals there who shared\
  \ with us the story behind the abundant sale of wooden phalluses in the handicraft\
  \ markets there. We also danced at traditional bhutanese songs after listening to\
  \ a night full of folklore. With so much happening, I had lost the track of time\
  \ only to discover that the following day was the day i'd be travelling back home.\
  \ \nIt was in the dancing, the singing, the cautious cycling at night, the \"Kuzuzangpo\
  \ La!\" followed by a series of laughter, the buttery aftertaste of drinking \"\
  suja\", the kindness of Tobgay and his mother that I found myself in. I found a\
  \ home away from home in between those endless majestic mountains, which resembled\
  \ the mountains back in my own hometown. A goodbye is not what I said to Bhutan\
  \ on my way back, for it was now my home and its only a matter of time until I return."
