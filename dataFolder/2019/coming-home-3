Text: "Namaste!\nIt means hello. Everybody said that to me, when I walking next to\
  \ them and said that mantra. I still remember how humble and polite they are. When\
  \ someone gives you an orange after tiring walk and found out you are becoming friend\
  \ until now. October, a month after I being graduated from university. I travelled\
  \ to Nepal, a country that already been in my bucket list since I still in high\
  \ school, a mixing culture country with thousand stories. I decided to take gap\
  \ months before I start working.\n2 weeks, I travelled to Nepal and hike to Annapurna\
  \ Base Camp, one of the famous trekking in Nepal. Indeed, the first thing come to\
  \ my mind when I looking Kathmandu life, it is crowded but yet I feel relieved.\
  \ 8 days in Annapurna Base Camp trek, I choose not to buy sim card or rent wi-fi\
  \ in teahouse, I forgot all those matters in Jakarta. It was unbelievable experience,\
  \ I thought it was impossible to reach the base camp, since I got cold stroke in\
  \ MBC. It might be the universe and my motivation who push me to the peak. The porter\
  \ woman who guided me through the night from Dovan to Bamboo, maybe she scares that\
  \ I will get lost, even I could not speak Nepali but she still accompanying me,\
  \ when I arrived at Bamboo and give her some tips she refuse my money. I am so lucky\
  \ to meet her since it\u2019s already dark in the trek but I don\u2019t bring a\
  \ flashlight. As I mentioned before, I often walk alone and separate from my group\
  \ that when I met many friends, in that day I went to Deurali I met a guy from Nepal\
  \ who also separate from his friends, we discuss about where we come from and we\
  \ work, turns out he visited my country once after that we talk about many things\
  \ until we arrive in Himalaya and he wait for his friends. \nAfter I went down from\
  \ Annapurna, I stayed for 2 nights in Pokhara where I found my peace. I didn\u2019\
  t take any local tour to visit the temple or mountain museum, because I am too tired\
  \ but I wake up early with a friend to catch sunrise in Phewa Lake and buy some\
  \ hot breads from a boy. Then, I just strolling around local bookstore and send\
  \ some postcards to my friends in Jakarta and ending my day in Pokhara with going\
  \ to local restaurant with those delicious naan bread and tandoori chicken. Pokhara\
  \ might be a little city in Nepal, but for me it gives many stories left behind\
  \ that makes me want to go back. \nIn the end, for all of nomads I really recommend\
  \ to visit Nepal not just a country whose located near Himalaya. But, it is a country\
  \ when you will not expect to find many unique stories from their culture until\
  \ their foods to try on."
