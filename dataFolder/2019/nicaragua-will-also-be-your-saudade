Text: "It all began the day I left Managua to San Jos\xE9. The celebration of the\
  \ Revolution had void any possible concurrent place. I found a bar at the airport;\
  \ I approached and I asked: \"Ten\xE9s caf\xE9?\" (instead of \"tienes caf\xE9\"\
  , as we speak in Mexico).\n\nMy name now is \xCDtzel (yes, so with accent mark).\
  \ From Guatemala to Brazil, passing through some exceptions that make greater effort\
  \ to pronounce my name well. Two weeks out of the country take me by surprise in\
  \ my  mexican-northern accent. Itzel had already become deeply involved in being\
  \ \"nica\".\n\nFrom Managua to Corn Island; from the \"voceo\" to the Creole English,\
  \ the Miskito, the Gar\xEDfuna, the \"usted\". A little jump to San Jose and Guanacaste\
  \ to greet the Paraguayan friends and immerse into the Pacific with them. But Nicaragua,\
  \ with the label of my very first Central American country, is always a visit that\
  \ is cultivated in the heart and blooms like the calala (passion fruit), maintaining\
  \ a sweet, acid and bitter taste at the same time, due our shared painful history.\n\
  \nI am extremely fortunate and blessed by all those friends, beautiful coincidences\
  \ that have formed in travel during this time. All of them transmitted to me in\
  \ the best way a national feeling that I could not have found in another situation.\
  \ Very present memories as the night of pre-revolution vigil, where everyone shared\
  \ memories of their parents throughout this political history of loss and hope in\
  \ these 38 years. The echo of nostalgia transmitted intergenerationally, with the\
  \ same tone of pain. The songs are still buzzing in my ear; I can still see those\
  \ trucks full of naive young people going to celebrate a dictatorship disguised\
  \ as socialism. But the good people, the smile and the warmth of all the strangers\
  \ who embraced me in some way, like the 20-year-old Miskita girl who had fun while\
  \ teaching me some words at the Bluefields airport; or that other lady who, bored,\
  \ touched my shoulder in that deadly plane to tell me a better story than my book:\
  \ her way in the FSLN (Sandinista National Liberation Front) during 80's as a woman\
  \ and the condemnation their partners always told her: \"Baha mairka saura!\" (means\
  \ \"that evil woman\", expression with which we could not stop laughing). The Corn\
  \ Island's caribbean sea, those afternoons when I swam over stars while watching\
  \ others appear in the sky. Physical loneliness full of company.\n\nI arrive at\
  \ the Mexico City airport. I make a mandatory stop at the lounge. I order a shot\
  \ mezcal and some chips with a lot of hot sauce and lemon. I take a picture and\
  \ I send it to all those who made me feel part of theirselves. I justify myself\
  \ with the waitress: \"I have been out of the country for two weeks\". She replies:\
  \ \"Do not worry, Mexico is full of 'picante'\". My heart fills with joy, while\
  \ I carry a bag full of \"rosquillas\" and Nicaraguan coffee with me. Then I realized\
  \ I do not longer belong to any place, but to the moments, to the Center and South\
  \ of America, to all the beautiful people that accompany me in the internal echo\
  \ that their stories left in me; the landscapes of volcanoes, lava, seas, lakes\
  \ and national parks , and that whole construction of my life.\n\nNicaragua, mainlukisna.\n\
