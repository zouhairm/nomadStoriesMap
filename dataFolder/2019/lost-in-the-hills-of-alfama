Text: "A phone that is smart enough to show you the way when you are lost is something\
  \ I do not want to miss any more. Four years ago I was still resisting that technology\
  \ and got lost in Lisbon late at night, in a neighbourhood called Alfama. The famous\
  \ Alfama. Birthplace of Fado, the music that expresses the soul of the Portuguese,\
  \ full of saudade, longing. The result of a shared history with Arabs and the music\
  \ of the workers and sailors of Lisbon. Songs about the sea, the life of the poor,\
  \ and about love, of course. I had heard about the Alfama. I had listened extensively\
  \ to Fado. Nevertheless, I thought of it as a clich\xE9, a nostalgic idea, lingering\
  \ in the memory of the country, lost long ago in modernity.\nComing out of the train\
  \ station and walking up the hills of the Alfama I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes\
  \ and ears. A mild and clear summer night, the stars above mirrored by the lights\
  \ of the bars and terraces. Laughter and wine, people and buildings all melded into\
  \ a fairy tale. And the Fado, sung by husky, divine voices, wafting through the\
  \ air. It was mesmerizing.\nI got lost, trying to find my way uphill through the\
  \ Fado bars to my hostel. With a confusing paper map in my hand, I was walking several\
  \ streets up and down, but the hostel did not appear anywhere. The streets behind\
  \ the bars were dark and abandoned. A young man crossed my way and offered help.\
  \ He took his smartphone and typed the address in. He walked with me all the way\
  \ to the hostel, carrying my suitcase. He said goodbye and vanished into the dark.\
  \ It was almost midnight and I was already in love - with Lisbon."
