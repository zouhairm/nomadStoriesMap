Text: "It was 13:52 when my friends and I finally reached the top of Rysy - the tallest\
  \ mountain in Poland. As we started down the hill and hours passed, we wondered\
  \ when the last bus would leave. We asked some others and found that the final bus\
  \ departed at 21:00. Surprisingly, it was 20:00 already. My friends felt a bit tired\
  \ to make a run for it so we continued to walk the rest of the way and hope for\
  \ the best.\n\nAs we continued down the trail, we noticed some other hikers running\
  \ down the hill. I couldn't shake the feeling that we would potentially miss the\
  \ bus. So I asked my group if it would be a good idea for me to try and hold up\
  \ the bus or inquire about departure times. They said the choice was up to me but\
  \ they could not run.\_My food and water were gone and I felt fine and energized\
  \ regardless of what we'd just done. So with a goal in mind I let my bag loose and\
  \ began to charge after the hikers.\n\nDescent or not, sometimes the path became\
  \ flat and a bit tough to run on as my feet were sore, not to mention I was hungry.\
  \ Regardless, the urgency of the situation and the thrill of running against time\
  \ drove me forward, and I ignored these qualms. After some minutes, I caught up\
  \ to the hikers and asked if any of them spoke English. One did and I asked about\
  \ the bus times; he replied that the last bus would leave at 21:00 but I could try\
  \ to hold it up. I thanked him and slowed to a jog to think about what to do.\n\
  As we continued, a chariot being pulled by two horses came up next to us, already\
  \ heading downhill. Multiple people on board waved and laughed, perhaps at our jogging\
  \ to catch the bus. Before they pulled away,\_I decided to put on a burst of speed\
  \ to take a chance at receiving help. I shot forward and managed to run evenly alongside\
  \ the chariot and as a curb came up, I rounded it to my advantage and began to overtake\
  \ the horses. The people and hikers were stunned and after some moments they cheered\
  \ and became excited. Even the driver of the chariot was happy as he snapped the\
  \ reins to increase his\_speed.\n\nThe hill started to decline into a sharper slope\
  \ that made both me and the horses go even faster, passing many hikers as we did.\
  \ I still felt a portion of energy within me, waiting to be used, so I drew it out\
  \ and ran ahead of the chariot, putting enough distance between us that I could\
  \ run in the middle of the road. \n\nThough I could've kept going, my lack of food\
  \ dawned on me and I realized I should slow up. I did and as the chariot started\
  \ to pass me, the passengers clapped and whistled as I bowed. Surprisingly, they\
  \ urged me to join them, motioning that there was space and that it was free. I\
  \ put in a final boost of energy to catch up, and jumped onto the back of the chariot,\
  \ arousing even more bouts of joy from the people.\n\nAfter they calmed down, I\
  \ caught my breath and one of the passengers asked me if I spoke English, Polish\
  \ or German. I said English and after he responded that his English was bad, I mentioned\
  \ that I understood/spoke German. With the language selected, I told him the current\
  \ situation. He didn't know if we could get another bus, but as we made it to the\
  \ bottom of the mountain he and others offered to help me out. They were grateful\
  \ for the entertainment and wanted to express their thanks. \n\nFortunately we were\
  \ able to order another bus for 22:00 and I was overjoyed. I said my goodbyes to\
  \ the people I'd met and as my friends arrived, I found they had heard of my race\
  \ against the horses. We got our bus as I recounted the experience and everything\
  \ turned out well. I couldn't have asked for better."
