Text: "An unearthly display of green and blue graces the early morning sky. An aurora\
  \ of its own disguise. \nBehind me a kiwi accent stringing together words longing\
  \ to form a sentence. \nI turn to meet the eyes in which the voice resides. A familiarity\
  \ in an unfamiliar place.\nBetween those frosty eyelashes lay all my history needs.\
  \ A teacher, better educated and holding an enviable position of the ability to\
  \ listen in class when others did not. Regretfully, I did not.\nWithin my peripheral\
  \ is the great divide. Now engulfed by miles of beautiful yet controversial art,\
  \ screaming both journalism and commercialism. Mixing seriousness with purposeful\
  \ entertainment. \n\nIt was 10am on a Saturday morning and not as hectic as I thought\
  \ it would be. Maybe the city hadn\u2019t woken up yet? Like any other city. \n\
  We were shortly blessed with the fall of snow. Accompanied by labor and laughter\
  \ as I pick myself up off of the slippery pavements in Alexanderplatz. My first\
  \ encounter with this unknown precipitation, as the vast desert wilderness in which\
  \ I call home would never foresee such a thing. \n\nAs we continue walking onto\
  \ the next, one foot after another we find ourselves sent back 75 years. Stumbling\
  \ upon a memorial and architectural design that is so unique. Every square inch\
  \ of concrete representing a fallen Jew. \u201CIt creates an illusion of instability,\
  \ and how this system is hopeless in time as we will never be able to remember the\
  \ horrors of each individual who suffered during the holocaust, instead has to be\
  \ understood in context of time and space,\u201D a friend of a friend stresses.\
  \ \nWe uninterruptedly walked on through the towering slabs. A cemetery if you will.\
  \ The atmosphere was coherent. A great amount of respect and sadness was present,\
  \ as those untouched by the horror began to measure the consequences of those beforehand.\n\
  \nTime heals most, and the space between can be tough. Once having a conversation\
  \ with a young German girl I met, she touched on the idea of modern day people making\
  \ jokes about the past destruction, showing no empathy towards such tragedy, explaining\
  \ that not everyone has been able to surpass nor move forward without the overshadowing\
  \ feeling of guilt. A painful legacy. \n\nAs the sun sets and the night owls rise,\
  \ it welcomes a change in pace. \nWe ride a bus through the spilling streets of\
  \ the city, inserting ourselves into surrounding conversations. Unsure of what the\
  \ night would bring so overcompensating for it with feelings of excitement, while\
  \ for the first time in 24hrs I was given the opportunity to finally inhale the\
  \ overwhelming generosity of the city thus far. It was near ending new years eve\
  \ or \u2018silvester\u2019 as the Germans like to call it. Despite the fearful firing\
  \ of fireworks across the street into other buildings, the locals like to use it\
  \ as a time to reflect and cheers their way into the next year, just as we intended\
  \ to do ourselves. \n\nArms made of wristbands. Faux glass cup in hand. 80% vodka,\
  \ 20% I\u2019m gonna regret this in the morning. The music danced it\u2019s way\
  \ into our core, leaving my bruised feet tapping subconsciously. Kisses were shared\
  \ between continents, paired with the overall rush of Berlin running through our\
  \ veins. \n\nFireworks cheerfully shot into the late night. Sounding a trigger of\
  \ the past for some, but a new beginning for others. \u201CWhere did you go?\u201D\
  \ I was asked, losing my accomplice amongst it all but attaining a new years story\
  \ worth sharing for time to come. \u201CProst.\u201D"
