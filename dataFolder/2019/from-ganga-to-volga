Text: "Simply put, mine is a story of four young people from India ,the land of Ganges\
  \ (often called Ganga in local Language) pledging to visit Russia for 2018 FIFA\
  \ world cup on four shots of tequila and finally how they managed to witness the\
  \ carnival by grabbing tickets at the last resale phase. From the thrill of almost\
  \ missing the flight from New Delhi airport to the disbelief of touching a meteoroid\
  \ at Cosmonautics Museum which fell on earth millions of years ago, from experiencing\
  \ the hangovers of dark soviet Union days to finding the joy of interacting with\
  \ warm and smiling Russian people, from the agony of seeing Argentina getting smashed\
  \ 3-0 by a spirited Croatia to getting shot by a YouTube channel from Czech Republic\
  \ \u2013 our tour had it all. We travelled to Russia on 18th June, 2018 and stayed\
  \ there for a week. Our trip started from Moscow, the capital of Russia followed\
  \ by a day trip at Nizhny Novgorod and we finished our trip in Saint Petersburg.\n\
  MOSCOW [18-20June]\nMoscow is an enormous capital which possess the core essence\
  \ of Russian history and culture. The tube network of Moscow was the best and efficient\
  \ network we have ever used. Many of the subway stations are famous for their architectural\
  \ marvels and these stations are full of legends of old and modern Russia. We entered\
  \ the Moscow Kremlin on a bright sunny morning and it took 4 hours to complete the\
  \ campus. Moscow being a hub for great cultural museums and art galleries takes\
  \ almost an entire week to complete. We visited the cosmonautics Museum containing\
  \ the artefacts of Russia\u2019s contribution to space travels. Moscow became the\
  \ central hub of football fans during the world cup. Not only the red square or\
  \ the Arbat Street but each and every corners of Moscow were reverberating with\
  \ ecstasy and enthusiasm of football fans from all parts of the world. We attended\
  \ the Portugal vs Morocco Match in the Luzhniki Stadium where we were lucky to see\
  \ Ronaldo Score a header causing an eruption of joy among the crowd. \nWe stayed\
  \ at a hotel at Reutov which was located in the outskirts of Moscow and used subway\
  \ for our navigation. Availability of diverse global cuisines and genuine warmth\
  \ from the people of Moscow made our stay a memorable one.\nNizhny Novgorod [21\
  \ June]\nWe planned a day trip to the birthplace of Maxim Gorky named Nizhny Novgorod\
  \ for Argentina-Croatia match through blabla Car and got our rides booked with a\
  \ bright Russian guy named Dmitri. Our road trip was full of insightful conversations\
  \ where we exchanged stories about India and Russia. Nizhny Novgorod is a nice little\
  \ gem beside river Volga where Croatian and Argentine Fans filled in the city with\
  \ hues of Red and Blue. The Banters were humorous, the hopes were blazing and the\
  \ chants were unforgettable. As we saw our favourite Argentina led by Messi perish,\
  \ we were also stunned to see a clinical performance by Luca Modric led Croatia.\
  \ We returned to Moscow with Dmitri next morning to catch the bullet train to Saint\
  \ Petersburg.\n\nSaint Petersburg [22-24 June]\nSaint Petersburg is more European\
  \ as a city than a Russian one. A visit to Winter Palace and Hermitage Museum left\
  \ us speechless for its sheer grandeur and artistic Marvel. A view of the entire\
  \ city square from the Top of Saint Isaac\u2019s Cathedral overlooking the Neva\
  \ River stole our breath. We also had a Baltic cruise ride on the last evening of\
  \ our stay to assimilate and share all of what we felt for those last seven days.\
  \ Brazilians fans teasing argentines by chanting \u201CMessi Ciao Ciao Ciao\u201D\
  \ song is easily one of the funny memories of Saint Petersburg.\nMoscow satisfied\
  \ our curiosity with its best treasures and stories. Nizhny Novgorod was picturesque\
  \ and the enchanting sight of Volga helped me find my title to this Travelogue-\u201C\
  From River Ganga to Volga\u201D. Finally, Saint Petersburg was all about feeling\
  \ mesmerised with art and self-reflection which inspires us to explore more in life.\
  \ The indefatigable spirit of football fans, the history and diversity of Russia\
  \ and the lovely people truly gifted us a priceless experience to cherish forever."
