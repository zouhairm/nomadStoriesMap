Text: "Cool breezy winds accompanied by the waft of chocolate aromas, all merging\
  \ into heavenly scents of excitement.  I let my nose lead the way and stumbled upon\
  \ a small Hill carved factory, beckoning my senses with different scents of chocolate.\
  \ \n\nI learnt that this Chocolate Factory at Ooty, India was one of the oldest\
  \ chocolate factories in the country. A grim ticket seller watches you from his\
  \ counter, beckoning you to buy the ticket to the factory. He sold me with his words,\
  \ \"if this is how you feel outside, imagine what you will feel inside\".\n\nAs\
  \ soon as you enter, you are greeted by machines whipping up tonnes and tonnes of\
  \ chocolate, making you spoilt for choice. It is a heaven of chocolate, and there\
  \ is always a flavour which you have never seen nor heard off.\n\nSo many samplers\
  \ to eat and there is always another version which you haven't tried. Boxes and\
  \ boxes of chocolate all around the blessed factory. Beautifully and tastefully\
  \ decorated, tempting you to look at them and rethink, \"Maybe, there is place in\
  \ the suitcase, for one more box. Let's add one more\".\n\nThere is a pleasant guide,\
  \ who tells you the entire history of the factory and takes you through the endless\
  \ churning s of the machines, which are silently whispering to you, to check out\
  \ which version of chocolate is getting churned on at that moment.\n\nMore flights\
  \ of stairs, more machines, more chocolate. Could this day get any better? I didn't\
  \ want this day to end. \n\nI took in a long breath, and filled my senses with chocolate.\
  \ Spoke to all the machines, busy churning chocolate and whispered \n\"Thank you\"\
  . Looked at the multiple counters and bought lots of chocolate for the family, as\
  \ they had already sent their needs when they saw my post on the Chocolate Factory.\
  \  \n\nWill I visit again? Affirmative. Even if I am not buying, would love to visit\
  \ this factory and fill my lungs with the heavenly aromas of Chocolate."
