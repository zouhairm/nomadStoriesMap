Text: It's a story I saved on the pages of my journal, one that made my hand tremble
  slightly as I wrote. A story I saved from the Skype calls home to mum and dad who
  were blissfully unaware, parents who thought at the time I was roaming the streets
  of beautiful Monaco not wandering lost in back streets of the vibrantly alive Morocco.
  A story that was unexpected and testing, one that has shaped the person I am and
  the way I travel ever since. Trust is something I was born into inherently, I was
  taught right from wrong and my childhood looked like something out of a modern day
  fairy tale. My travels after leaving, sure they confronted my senses, tested the
  way I look at society and made me long to live as far outside of the box as possible.
  Trust however always came easy and as I met pretty new strangers from other cultures
  and walks of life I felt safe with them. I felt lucky to meet them and be welcomed
  so generously into their lives. So then when this trust was abused and my life,
  only momentarily, tipped on its head, things in me shifted. This is a story about
  the women who become statistics, a near miss for two young Australian girls who
  met a young boy on a night train to Fez.
