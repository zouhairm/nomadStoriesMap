Text: "When I decide to plan my journey to Cayo Largo my only perspective was to spend\
  \ my time deep into the natural beauty of the Caribbean away from anything and anybody.\
  \ \nI decided to celebrate both my birthday and the New Year in that small island\
  \ because I read it was an occasional refuge to marauding pirates in the past and\
  \ now it is considered one of the country's most breath-taking natural environments.\n\
  The perfect place to enjoy my vacation in complete serenity!\nI was prepared to\
  \ find nothing except beautiful beaches, white sands, and the fantastic Caribbean\
  \ sea where I could have some \u201Cme time\u201D just practicing yoga and meditation\
  \ along the seaside, walking and lying in the warm sun of the winter Caribbean.\
  \ \nBut sometimes things don't turn out the way you wish! \nA long flight squeezed\
  \ in a small seat listening some Cubans talking about their country for all the\
  \ time.  A crazy tip on a local bus to reach the village.  An old resort with an\
  \ unsafe-for-swimming beach in front of it and no comfort at all.\nI suddenly realize\
  \ that I had to forget all of my plans.  I arrived in  Cuba, a country where you\
  \ have to follow the strange rhythm of life.\nI need to confess that at the beginning\
  \ I felt frustrated and upset. I had planned my perfect holiday for months, and\
  \ now everything seems a mess!\nEvery morning I had to hurry up hoping to catch\
  \ the only bus available and pray I could find a boat to reach the beach because\
  \ if local people decide that it is not the right day to sail your single perspective\
  \ is to get stuck in front of the dock and wait.\nEven when I decided to plan a\
  \ trip to La Havana to visit some historical monuments and local shops, it was a\
  \ screw-up!  I woke up at 6.00 a.m and took an awful flight hoping to reach the\
  \ town safe and sound. And when I arrived at La Havana I  got an unpleasant surprise:\
  \ my local guide forgot to tell me that the entire city was out of work that day\
  \ because of the National Day and I couldn't visit anything I had planned to see!\n\
  But the point is that during my vacation I understood that life is an unexpected\
  \ journey itself and when you put your expectations apart you can live your wonderful\
  \ adventure, no matter what your plans are!\nSo I started watching the thing differently.\
  \ \nEven if I had to take such a long time to reach the beach I was one the luckiest\
  \ person who could spend the New Year Day on one of the most beautiful beaches in\
  \ the world. \nEven if I had to abandon the idea to stay in peace, I was lucky because\
  \ I had the chance to meet some lovely new friends with sharing both amazing adventures\
  \ and funny misadventures. \nI had the opportunity to learn about a different culture\
  \ and watch it from a different perspective. I learned to accept that you need to\
  \ embrace the unknown. And when I finally opened my eyes  I was able to encounter\
  \ along my path an old and bizarre woman who feeds crocodiles, a fisherman who enjoys\
  \ broadcasting the weather, a little band who loves sings local songs serving authentic\
  \ dishes along the sea and I was able to be enthralled by their stories.\nI discovered\
  \ that people could smile no matter how much they earn or what they do. I learned\
  \ to embrace their different approach to life, and I was able to discover that a\
  \ new Cuba has already born. A new country made by a new generation of guys who\
  \ try to melt the future and modern life with their roots with all their passion\
  \ and openness.\nThat must be the real essence of traveling."
