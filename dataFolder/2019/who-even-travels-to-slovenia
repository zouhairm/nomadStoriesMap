Text: "In 2018 I took part in my third Topdeck Tour.  I was going to spend 2 weeks\
  \ traveling along the eastern side of Europe. Staring from Rome and going through\
  \ to Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and this place called Slovenia.\n\nThis little\
  \ 2 night stop over never rated very high on the things I wanted to experience list.\
  \ But holy hell, the place was amazing. Think Switzerland but only cheaper. So much\
  \ cheaper. There was mountains with snow, amazing scenery, amazing food. Breaking\
  \ it down to a few words to fit;\n The first introduction to Slovenia was a few\
  \ hours break in  Lake Bled, such a beautiful place. Picture this giant lake surrounded\
  \ by lush green grass and sweeping trees. There's a castle far up on a hill surrounding\
  \ the lake and there in the middle of the lake is this tiny island with a church.\
  \ You could hirer a boat and row out to the island yourself or you could be punted\
  \ across. It was an amazing place.  Instagram worthy shots were endless. There was\
  \ also activities such as archery available and (in the right season) summer tobogganing.\
  \ After an amazing stop filled with Bled cream cake (#amazing) we then drove through\
  \ to the city of Ljublijana.\nFirst of all the hotel we stayed in? Best one of the\
  \ whole trip. Amazing. Secondly, the city was beautiful. All old buildings with\
  \ detail and little bridges with a river. The city itself was very clean, there\
  \ an extremely eco friendly country. In Ljublina cars are banned from certain parts\
  \ of the city and there's little golf cart looking things which go around giving\
  \ out free shuttle rides around the town. The elderly take precedence in the ques\
  \ for these! One of the optional activities of the tour was a food tour of the city.\
  \ We had pasta, beer, meet, vegetables. Everything.  And all of it was amazing.\
  \ One of the restaurants we ate at was Druga Violin which likes to employ people\
  \ who may have some form of a handicap. The food and staff were amazing. Such a\
  \ nice place. Really made you Think why can't this happen in more places? Why don't\
  \ we offer this where I live? \n\nI really went to Slovenia expecting some beat\
  \ up old town that you see in movies. Where everyone looks depreased. I had no knowledge\
  \ of the country at all, but it was my second favourite country of my trip. I would\
  \ love to go back and explore all over the country one day."
