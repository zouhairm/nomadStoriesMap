Text: "Well, I don\u2019t have much experience with travel, due to my reasonable financial\
  \ conditions, the only trip I made during this time was to Brasilia, in the hope\
  \ of getting a new career path, I had never been on a plane before, my mother who\
  \ is very attached to me, had her concerns of mother (she was almost crying, seeing\
  \ only my backpack going towards the plane, and Imagine when the plane took off),\
  \ because for the first time her daughter travels. I thought I would be afraid to\
  \ fly, but to my surprise, I loved it, my heart sped up and I felt a chill in my\
  \ belly, I got even more fissured with the sky, having him so close to me. This\
  \ trip was not for fun, but I still managed to fall in love with every corner I\
  \ passed by in Brasilia. I had taken a taxi, to know where I was going to take the\
  \ test, in that the driver during the way told me how Brasilia was a planned capital\
  \ and the fact that it had the shape of the plane, pointed out the part of the avenue\
  \ that was one of the wing, also told me a bit of his history, and so it was a brief\
  \ tour. So I did the test, and I had to get the plane back, I remember that before\
  \ going to the airport to return to my city I asked him to take the long way to\
  \ know a little more of the capital. And I made a promise to myself that whenever\
  \ I travel I will always have these first-time emotions, which I want to intensify\
  \ more and more. As I said before, I haven\u2019t much experience in traveling,\
  \ but I have dreamed and imagined with many trips, just as it says in the song of\
  \ Dragon Ball Z in Brazilian version \"With my mind I go to a thousand places and\
  \ the imagination gives me the strength to fly.\" So I already imagined myself in\
  \ China visiting the Great Wall, I see myself in every place of this world in its\
  \ tourist and historical points, hearing about how culture and civilization have\
  \ formed for what it is today. From this brief account of mine, I see the need to\
  \ have the courage to do something, no matter what it is, dive right in what to\
  \ do, that often can be the unknown, after all you need the will to get out of the\
  \ ordinary to go to the unknown. When we are in the presence of something unknown\
  \ we can be frightened however that will make it rare for us, because it is necessary\
  \ to take a step to the unknown, is to go beyond, even without knowing the result\
  \ or what awaits you, but have the courage to continue , hoping to find the extraordinary."
