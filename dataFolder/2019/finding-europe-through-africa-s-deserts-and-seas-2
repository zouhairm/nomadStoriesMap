Text: "This is just a part of my long story.I am in the process of chronicling my\
  \ experiences into a book and ultimately a movie to create awareness to this scourge\
  \ of irregular migration and human trafficking, with the aim of helping governments,\
  \ policy makers and potential victims get educated to the perils of these migration\
  \ methods.\n\nMy travel story started from my West African country of Nigeria in\
  \ the year 1999 when I was just 21 with no legal or financial means to realize my\
  \ dream of migrating through the regular method of securing a visa and traveling\
  \ by air to Europe in a bid to escape the economic hardships in my homeland and\
  \ help bring succor to my family by sacrificing myself as a lamb on the alter of\
  \ setting out to the unknown in Europe in search of a better life. \n\nHaving been\
  \ disadvantaged by the lack of all the requisites to achieve this dream of mine,\
  \ I had set about achieving it by traveling through the deserts and seas of Africa\
  \ journeying through The Niger Republic, Mali, Algeria, Morocco and finally making\
  \ it into Spain after almost two years of untold suffering on this perilous journey.\
  \ \n\nI had been faced with near and actual deaths as I witnessed co travelers abandoned\
  \ and left behind to their fate whenever they show any signs of fatigue not to mention\
  \ the many human skeletal remains we came upon in the course of this journey. \n\
  \nAt some point on this trip, I had been on the receiving end of been left behind\
  \ after taking a short rest from my group and had to find my way all by myself going\
  \ further. While alone, it had started raining heavily with no where in sight to\
  \ take refuge or shelter I had kept on walking until I stumbled upon a cemetery.\
  \ Having been walking for a long time and fatigued I hadn't the strength to carry\
  \ on any further that night so, I simply reached for the closest grave to me upon\
  \ which I laid and slept the night through until the next morning.\n\nThere is also\
  \ the story of how one of the young girls in my group who was heavily pregnant and\
  \ had to do the long day/night grueling walks with us had gone into labor in the\
  \ middle of the desert with no medical help in sight. This had sent almost every\
  \ one in my group running in fright and I was left alone with this young lady and\
  \ the young man who was her trafficker. We had both done our bit however crude a\
  \ way it was to help her birth her baby. We had to improvise for lack of any medical\
  \ stuffs like a blade to sever the baby from the umbilical cord etc.\n\nIt's quite\
  \ a long and gut wrenching story. \n\nI am set out to using my story to educate\
  \ and sensitize the ignorant to the dangers of Irregular migration/human trafficking\
  \ and how this method of migration is certainly not worth it with the story of what\
  \ I was faced with when I eventually made it across into Europe after two years\
  \ of untold suffering on the road.\n\nLet's do this together and tell the story.\
  \ A professional written book and a movie on my story will make for a hit I am so\
  \ sure."
