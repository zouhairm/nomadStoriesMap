Text: "20th December,9:30 P.M.(IST)-11000 ft up in the air,\"There are 197 other countries\
  \ in the world,why there?;Can I get down from the plane and catch a flight to somewhere\
  \ else\",thanks to the internet I was asking myself these questions en route Moscow\
  \ via New Delhi while also sifting  through a Lonely Planet's Russian Guide.\n21st\
  \ December,5:30 A.M.(MST)-I get out of the airport and set my foot on Russian snow\
  \ walking to my cab battling -11\xB0C cold winds,\"But I love snow and winters and\
  \ cold weather,don't I?\"\nAbout an hour long drowsy drive we arrive at our plush\
  \ and luxurious looking hotel on the Serpukhovskiy Val Street region;The display\
  \ board of the hotel something in Russian was fully covered in snow and it was hard\
  \ to make out what was anyways written in such an elusive language.\n\nAfter spending\
  \ the remainder of the day ordering room service and sleeping tight we woke up early\
  \ the next morning and hit the streets of Russia's Capital City,The city of domes-Moscow\
  \ after putting on tens of layers of clothes,Timberland snow boots(such a niche)\
  \ and our comfy and immaculately looking Columbia snow jackets-boy was it cold;walking\
  \ amidst slush and puddles of melted waters we take the subway from the Tulskaya\
  \ Metro Station and reach the Ploschad Revolutsii metro station to reach the Red\
  \ Square to do all that almost every second person in the world who has been to\
  \ Russia has done-St.Basil's Cathedral and the Kremlin,we although were lucky to\
  \ witness the \"Changing of the guard\".\nWith cups of hot chocolate milk and warm\
  \ and comforting pretzels in our hands we spent atleast the next hour roaming around\
  \ the area and imbibing and absorbing the vibe the place had to offer,it was almost\
  \ like an orgasm of cultural inundation.\n\nAlmost stuck between the train doors,I\
  \ somehow managed to get into the train with my cousin laughing wildy at me and\
  \ making me feel uncomfortable\nsharing the train coach with a hundred other pale-skinned\
  \ and for some reason distraught-Muscovites.\nOur next stop-back to Tulskaya station,then\
  \ a million \"Spasibos\" and a trillion \"izvinites\" later we make it to the infamous\
  \ Gorky Park-A snow-white  paradise adjoining  the frozen River Moskva,which led\
  \ us to Snow Skating;With slow Russian classics playing and the gorgeous scents\
  \ of pretty women overpowering the air,I almost instantly fell for the setting,literally,I\
  \ didn't know how to ice-skate,still don't.\nAfter 6 days and a million more museums\
  \ later,came that part of the trip that I was looking forward to the most-Murmansk.\n\
  \nIt was on the 26th of December,2018 that my dream for the past 6 months to catch\
  \ a glimpse of the Aurora Borealis was going to come true after a lot of planning\
  \ and eager checks of the Borealis forecasts.\nTwo hours and forty minutes of flying\
  \ saw us in the largest city above the Arctic Circle ,a place most conducive to\
  \ witness one of the most sought after fairy tale unique phenomenons of Mother Earth.\n\
  Here it stays dark all through the polar nights,which means forty days of utter\
  \ darkness,though the residents here have found a way to adapt to even this harsh\
  \ a condition-they eat well,dance,sing and have a merry time sipping on vodka.\n\
  The next two days would mean cloudy skies and snow,meaning no Auroras,so we went\
  \ around the city in the Murmansk Oblast and visited  the Lenin Nuclear Icebreaker,Murmansk\
  \ Ocenarium,River Lavna and the best-Husky Farm in Ulybka Alyaski where you can\
  \ pet and play with cute Siberian Huskies and have them snow-sledge you and also\
  \ saw a giant bull statue in the middle of 100 acres of white snow and no habitation\
  \ whatsoever.\nThe evening of the 28th of December,we get out of our,sort of BnB\
  \ and look up at the skies,praying to the weather lords for nice weather,like the\
  \ peasants do for rain in the Sahara Desert.\nAt around 7:00 P.M.,the expression\
  \ on my face was pretty much like what is on a mother's face on seeing her baby\
  \ for the first time,right infront of my eyes were green,bright dazzling streaks\
  \ of lights jumping from the horizon.I was almost broken into tears,for I was not\
  \ able to bear that much beauty.\nSpasibo to God is all I said........."
