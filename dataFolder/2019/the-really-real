Text: "As I throw a quick glance around the stuffed restaurant and see all the other\
  \ pale-faced European families with their sweaty foreheads and dusty shorts, grouped\
  \ along the white chalked walls, each staring gloomily down at their own variation\
  \ of the same plate of indeterminable colored goo,  similar to my own, something\
  \ dawns on me, and I cannot help but laugh. \n\nAfter hitch-hiking our way to Morocco\
  \ all the way from Denmark, my friend Andreas and I have finally reached our destination.\
  \ This is it. No bullshit. This is the realest deal on the market, though it couldn\u2019\
  t have been a further cry from what we\u2019d imagined the day before, as we stood\
  \ outside our tent in the kite-surfing paradise of Tarifa, looking across the narrow\
  \ strait of Gibraltar, padding each other on the back with tired arms. Tomorrow\
  \ was to be the \u201CIndiana Jones\u201D-moment of our trip, we said to each other.\n\
  \nAs we went to sleep in our tiny tent, between the surfers vans and the windy beaches,\
  \ we talked about how we would be striding off the ferry and take in the local sights\
  \ in Morocco the next day. We\u2019d kick a few monuments and eat a kebab before\
  \ getting ready to head back up north with a more worldly look in our eyes and our\
  \ backpacks full of blankets and rare spices. The hard part would be getting aboard\
  \ the ferry, we thought.\n\nThe ferry turned out to be the easy part. Flapping our\
  \ beet-root colored EU-passports about like fly swatters did the trick. It usually\
  \ does.\nAs the ferry slipped across the mint-green water and the white outline\
  \ of Tangiers grew in the horizon, we repeated the pact we had made on our way here:\
  \ Not getting caught in any touristic traps. We were going to seek out the real\
  \ Morocco, not the flashy make-believe stuff. We figured that we had that whole\
  \ \u201CBeware when you go to the African continent, pale-face\u201D under control,\
  \ since we both had been to the continent before. But Morocco didn\u2019t know that.\
  \ And if Morocco did know, Morocco didn\u2019t care.\n\nLess than five minutes after\
  \ going ashore on the port, we get hailed by a guy in a beat-up looking Peugeot.\
  \ A yellow piece of plastic suggesting it\u2019s a taxi. Determined not to let ourselves\
  \ be taken for any rides, neither figuratively nor literally, we ignore him and\
  \ keep walking towards the city.\nThis move is rubbing our taxi-driving friend the\
  \ wrong way and he angrily shouts at us: \u201CDon\u2019t you know, this is Ramadan?\
  \ People haven\u2019t eaten since sunrise, so you shouldn\u2019t behave like that.\
  \ You might end up provoking somebody unintentionally\u201D.\nWe hurriedly apologize\
  \ and try to explain that we only ignored him because we wanted to experience Tangiers\
  \ on our own. Our taxi-driving friend smiles and says that he has a cousin who can\
  \ help us do just that. \n\nTen minutes later we are scaling the narrow streets\
  \ of the Kashba while cousin Achmed \u2013 who by the way speaks about five languages\
  \ - tells us about the various famous Europeans that used to come here to smoke\
  \ their kif and relax. Andreas tries to ask him about the cultural situation in\
  \ Morocco today, but Achmed only answers vaguely before he segways back into anecdotes\
  \ about the popstars and fashion-icons who used the atmospheric city as their home\
  \ away from home.\n\nAt lunch-time we have already bought our first carpet from\
  \ another guy that Achmed seems to know quite well, and now he is promising us to\
  \ find a nifty little restaurant he knows, that does local cuisine. \u201CA small\
  \ local place\u201D, Achmed assures us. \u201CSpecial for you\u201D says Achmed.\
  \ \n\nThat\u2019s where the goo is.\n\nI imagine that each of the goo eating groups\
  \ at the other tables felt the exact same way as I did initially. All came for the\
  \ \u201Cauthentic Moroccan experience\u201D. Accepting the fact that this, in all\
  \ it\u2019s poly-lingual, special-price for my friends, cunning glory, is actually\
  \ part of it, is hard, but necessary nonetheless."
