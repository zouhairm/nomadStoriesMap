Text: "On December of 2018, my parents came up with the idea of traveling to the city\
  \ of Holambra, which is only a little less than an hour from my hometown, Campinas.\
  \ It was a beautiful sunny day and it felt just like the best thing to do in the\
  \ beginning of Brazil's summer. After we got all ready, my sister, my parents and\
  \ I got in the car and my father drove us to the city. Of course we listened to\
  \ plenty of music along the way, enjoying the family trip.\n   My expectations were\
  \ high because I've heard just so many good things about that city, how it was founded\
  \ because of the Dutch migration that took place by the outbreak of World War II.\
  \ The name \"Holambra\" is the junction of the Brazilian words HOLanda (Holland),\
  \ AM\xE9rica (America) and BRAsil (Brazil) and the Dutch population started to grow\
  \ flowers and raise cattle, until the city was finally emancipated and recognized\
  \ as a Tourist Resort by the state of S\xE3o Paulo. Once in a year Holambra promotes\
  \ the biggest flower exposition in Latin America: the Expoflora. \n   When we arrived,\
  \ I couldn't believe how beautiful the city was. The architecture and the city itself\
  \ seemed like an accurate representation of Holland and you could see that people\
  \ there were used to live in a different pattern. When I was home, I was only wondering\
  \ what I was going to find in this city, but being there and seeing all those little\
  \ houses, beautiful gardens, street lamps, beautiful stores selling all kinds of\
  \ souvenirs from the Netherlands, homemade jam and even little dutch clogs. \n \
  \  I started to think how much I wanted to visit every single place of the city\
  \ and take as many pictures as I could. What else was I going to find? Me and my\
  \ family walked through many streets, walked into some stores, bought little souvenirs,\
  \ saw tourists from all kinds of placesa and, of course, he just had to but the\
  \ homemade jam. \n   We had lunch there, I took loads of pictures and I even bought\
  \ a postcard from the city, a little pin, everything that woul remind me of how\
  \ much of a great place that was. \n   We also got many flowers, visited all kinds\
  \ of flower shop until we decided to see the rest of the city.\n   My family and\
  \ I got into the car and my father drove us to a windmill and it was unique. We\
  \ just stared at it for a while, contemplating how pretty it was and how much it\
  \ did remind us of all we've ever known from Holland. My father knew the city pretty\
  \ well and also drove us to a couple of lakes in the city. \n   At the end of the\
  \ afternoon we finally got back home and all I kept thinking was how much I saw\
  \ and didn't expect to find at all, a city that takes anyone into a little trip\
  \ to Holland and a city that is so simple, yet so sofisticated as the city from\
  \ which it was inspired."
