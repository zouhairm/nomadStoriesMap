Text: "It happened in Lisbon, on my last day there. My friends and I could not stand\
  \ such a long close contact and quarrelled finally. I wanted to go to a bar somewhere\
  \ around for the last glass of my favourite porto wine. Places from Foursquare were\
  \ closed and I was coming back home, looking into open doors for a place to drink.\
  \ \n\nI reached a tall medieval wall with a narrow long staircase in the middle\
  \ leading to my house. And suddenly I saw an open door on the right, with no window,\
  \ no table nearby, just a door in a huge stone wall. Looked in. The Bar. Tiny. It\
  \ was the smallest bar on Earth which I\u2019d ever seen, and believe me, I'm a\
  \ big expert in places like this.\n\nThe bartender was behind the bar alone. Overcoming\
  \ my unwillingness to be the center of attention, I walked in. After all, did I\
  \ have a choice? Imagine a room of 8 square meters, half of which is given to the\
  \ bartender's workplace, and the second half contains 8 chairs, by 4 on opposite\
  \ walls. The man smiled and asked what I wanted to order. Porto wine was not simple,\
  \ but a unique, rare and exclusive party, as bartender said. I took a picture of\
  \ the glass in which it was served, it was 100 years old and cut with patterns.\
  \ The counter is lined with a local landmark, Majolica ceramics, which was also\
  \ 200 years old.\n\nThe glass was empty, it was time for a second no less exceptional\
  \ porto wine. The bartender promised to give it for free, if he did not reach the\
  \ portion, but this time no luck - there was enough in the bottle. \n\nTo say that\
  \ I was fascinated by the place and the narrator behind the counter is to say nothing!\
  \ Daniel, so his name was, like a spider weaving a web, enveloped me with stories\
  \ about the rarest specimens on the shelves, giving a sniff and try some of them,\
  \ while making me delicious cocktails and gradually telling more about the area,\
  \ about his life and the world of alcohol.\n\nHe was not just a bartender, but the\
  \ owner of that bar. And he owned the house, which was 500 years old, where the\
  \ bar was and also couple of apartments with huge terraces with trees with lemons\
  \ and oranges, which Daniel used in his cocktails. On these terraces he arranged\
  \ parties for bartenders from around the world and winemakers. And he had vineyards\
  \ in the Porto valley, he became a winemaker before the bartender. And before that,\
  \ he was and continued to be a financier in Canada, among his clients were world\
  \ hockey stars. He was also Professor at the University of Montreal. And he had\
  \ his own boat there and he was sailing on it to the ocean with his dog. How could\
  \ it all fit into one human body? And among all these Daniel had the talent of an\
  \ exciting storyteller who could become your friend for one evening.\n\nAfter couple\
  \ of cocktails and porto wine, which relaxed me pretty much, couple of Americans\
  \ came and asked Manuel to make cocktails that they liked from last time. The conversation\
  \ was shared by four of us, exchanging impressions about Portugal. The gasified\
  \ cocktail was so large that it had to be shared between the guests also. After\
  \ it I received the job offer in New-York from the American, the evening got not\
  \ only pleasant but also useful development. \n\nTime before my departure was limited\
  \ and I was drunk pretty much, so I need to say good bye to my new friends.\n\n\
  Speakeasy bar is a popular format in the world, but the real, genuine, heartfelt\
  \ and memorable speakeasy experience I had only once, here.  \n\nSuch magical and\
  \ unpredictable moments in my travels are especially valuable for me. The chance\
  \ brought me to a tiny amazing place with an equally amazing host. Through him I\
  \ learned a beautiful new world. For perfect journey it is not necessary to walk\
  \ through the streets from morning to night, you just need to look in the right\
  \ door."
