Text: "My heart was beating fast and my palms were sweaty as I stood beside the flight\
  \ attendant as we waited for my host family to meet me. I have always felt that\
  \ twelve was such a grownup age but standing in the middle of one of Europe\u2019\
  s gateway airports made me realize that I am just a little girl. My grandmother\
  \ had packed a box of mangoes for my host family - a gift from the Philippines.\
  \ I can smell it now, and it seemed out of place, wafting through Frankfurt\u2019\
  s cool, crisp, spring air.\n\nMy host mother, Inga, was a jolly German woman. She\
  \ had beautiful eyes that crinkle at the corners when she smiled. She had called\
  \ the neighbors over for some \u201CKaffee und Kuchen,\u201D so that they can meet\
  \ me and try the mangoes that I had brought. She sat me down in front of a bundt\
  \ that she baked for my arrival. She said we will have it the traditional way, with\
  \ a cup of fruit tea. I was in love at first bite - warm, chocolatey, with a hint\
  \ of almond. It went perfectly with my cup of strawberry tea.\n\nThe house was near\
  \ the end of a cul-de-sac. My host father, Udo, was an engineer and built the house\
  \ himself, brick by brick. It was a modern-style bungalow bursting with brilliant\
  \ mechanical engineering concepts. A green upright piano stood near the glass front\
  \ door, where my host sister, two host brothers and myself took turns practicing\
  \ our lessons.\n\nOn some days, I would be the one to go the dairy farmer\u2019\
  s for the milk. On my way, I would cut across the cemetery, weaving through red\
  \ and yellow flowers that loved-ones tended for their dead everyday. I believe I\
  \ had assimilated quite well, comfortably greeting everyone I came across with a\
  \ cheerful, \u201CGuten Tag,\u201D as it is what a good-mannered girl would do.\
  \ I would then go over to HLMarkt, for Milka Chocolate and \"gummibaerchen.\" On\
  \ my way back, I would do what I set out to do and make my way to the barn. I would\
  \ place my empty jar over the counter that was as tall as my eyebrows and wait as\
  \ the farmer fills it in from what seemed to me was a golden milk pipe. I would\
  \ be so eager to get back home and have a glass myself,  as the smell of the warm\
  \ milk and how it looked so creamy was intoxicating.\n\nThe best part of my days\
  \ were the weekend breakfast spreads.  We would sit around the table, taking in\
  \ the day slowly. Udo would start  a topic and encourage us to chime in, as he sliced\
  \ bread with a very impressive bread knife that made the thinnest slices. There\
  \ would be plates of different cheeses, hams, sausages, and jars of jams and honey.\
  \ I would copy my host sister, Susi, who would layer her bread with butter, lettuce,\
  \ a slice of cheese, jam and \u201CRohschinken.\u201D These meals would last more\
  \ than an hour - as we talked about culture, politics, economics and the flowers\
  \ that have bloomed in the garden. I remember these very fondly, as I felt the deepest\
  \ affinity at this table, being so different yet so alike with them.\n\nIt was a\
  \ day in Autumn. I take it all in - the familiar gentle breeze that was a tad too\
  \ cold, the rustling of the leaves and the quietness of Buedesheim, this beautiful,\
  \ tiny town, 20 miles off Frankfurt. It has been more than twenty years since I\
  \ was first here. I see a lot has changed as we drive through town, but I still\
  \ see the echoes of what it had been.\n\nIt felt like coming home, this time with\
  \ my husband, so I can introduce him to my German family. As we sat around another\
  \ breakfast spread, it was not just the comfort food that was warming my heart.\
  \ I watched as Udo and my husband talked about geography,  Inga pouring tea and\
  \ Susi buttering bread. There were more faces around the table, too, as time and\
  \ love grow a family. This table, in the middle of a small village, had shown me\
  \ the world."
