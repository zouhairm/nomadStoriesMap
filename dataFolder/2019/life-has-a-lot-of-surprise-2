  \ of Congo. I made a lot from friends from different countries. one of my course-mate\
  \ is a lecturer at an other private University  in Kampala and teaches the course\
  \ unit of Tourism. As the program gives the opportunity to make a tour trip during\
  \ all the three years of their undergraduate studies supervised by the lecturer\
  \ who's my course-mate. having a free time at the University my colleague requested\
  \ me escort in the trip for four days.\nAs i am always interested in exploring new\
  \ area I accepted to go the trip with my colleagues.\nBecause was planned to start\
