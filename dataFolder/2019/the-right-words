Text: "\u201CYou see, I have to teach myself,\u201D he says. We\u2019re lying in hammocks,\
  \ a faint breeze blowing through the pagoda that carries the distant scent of rain\
  \ and cow manure, when he takes a small notebook out of his pocket. I glance over\
  \ from the view of the Cambodian plains\u2014patches of dark green and yellow fields\
  \ so rich they seem surreal, with the ominous blue of encroaching rainclouds in\
  \ the distance\u2014to see his earnest expression, his fingers tapping the page.\n\
  \nWe\u2019d been talking about learning languages, about English and Khmer, the\
  \ difficulties, the trials, the joys. He\u2019d been telling me how he wanted to\
  \ attend school to learn English but it\u2019s prohibitively expensive, that he\
  \ has to take visitors like me around the countryside on his moto to even get close\
  \ to making enough. I see his small, tidy script on the pages as he learns words\
  \ I\u2019ve never even heard of or rarely use. \u2018Quizzical\u2019, \u2018abscond\u2019\
  , and \u2018extraneous\u2019 jump out at me with the Khmer translation beside it.\
  \ The pages are cramped full. I am instantly in awe of this man as he scribbles\
  \ in a word we had just been discussing: \u2018improbable\u2019. \n\n\u201CWell\
  \ it looks like you\u2019re already doing great!\u201D I tell him and he brushes\
  \ off my compliment with a shy smile, but then goes and buys me an orange soda.\
  \ We relax, sipping our drinks and watching the oncoming storm from our quiet resting\
  \ place at the top of the mountain, an empty room lined with hammocks for weary\
  \ travelers. My mind busy with thoughts of struggling dreams and societal limitations.\n\
  \nThat was supposed to be the end of our day: several temple visits that I requested\
  \ when I flagged him down the night before. Instead, he asks if I want to see one\
  \ more place, his favourite place. I enthusiastically agree. We jump onto his moto\
  \ after our moment of shared peace and zip down the dirt roads that criss-cross\
  \ the surrounding countryside of Phnom Penh. We pass water buffalo who carefully\
  \ watch us, standing in hoof-deep puddles from recent rains. In two not-quite short\
  \ hours, just as my right leg feels like it will burn off from the scalding exhaust\
  \ pipe that always rests uncomfortably close to the second rider\u2019s calf, we\
  \ arrive at his destination: a small lake. I see murky waters and feel the muggy\
  \ breeze that comes with the summer thunderstorms. Trees grow right to the water\u2019\
  s edge, insulating us. There are maybe ten wooden shacks erected on stands out in\
  \ the water with planks of wood as teetering walkways. Cambodian families rest and\
  \ relax in the shacks, leaning against clapboard walls, chatting. Someone leads\
  \ us to a shack and takes a food order. He gets his favourite snack: a whole chicken,\
  \ head with bulging eyes still attached, and a lime and pepper sauce to dip into.\
  \ We sit in comfortable silence and snack as I watch a troupe of children all dressed\
  \ in identical orange robes\u2014monks-in-training\u2014march out to their own shack,\
  \ covering their shaven heads with the corners of their robes and laughing with\
  \ each other. Some disrobe and jump into the waters, floating idly on patched black\
  \ inner tubes.\n\n\u201CThank you for bringing me here,\u201D I say, remembering\
  \ his notebook, his words. I try to use one of them in a sentence as a joke but\
  \ fail. I realize that my English isn\u2019t great.\n\n\u201CEveryone comes here\
  \ to relax. I wanted you to see it.\u201D His kindness is apparent in his words,\
  \ in his smile. On the way home, we pull off onto a dirt road and he lets me drive\
  \ the moto, which probably isn\u2019t allowed but it\u2019s exhilarating and we\
  \ both laugh at my wobbly driving skills. I gladly hand it back over to him to drive\
  \ us to the capital, where we part ways with an awkward embrace. I wonder if he\
  \ managed to attend classes, to shape his life into what he hoped. I still see that\
  \ notebook, words piled on top of each other: \u2018ethereal\u2019, \u2018ephemeral\u2019\
  , \u2018chimera\u2019."
