Text: "\u201CI don\u2019t speak Italian\u201D was the first thought that flew into\
  \ my mind as I walked off the airplane.  I\u2019d read that Rome had some of the\
  \ fewest English speakers in a major European city, and the panic was beginning\
  \ to set in.  \nThe same fear and questioning of my decisions that I felt at the\
  \ beginning of the summer were back, and maybe even stronger.  But now I didn\u2019\
  t have the comfort of knowing the language, or knowing that the rest of my group\
  \ would be joining me in a few short days.  No, now I was alone.  A solo, female\
  \ traveler, who doesn\u2019t speak Italian. \n\nI followed the multilingual, and\
  \ pictured signs to the train that would take me into Rome, and I remembered the\
  \ next big task before me: navigating to my hostel.  Despite leading and navigating\
  \ on many successful weekend excursions with my classmates, I did not feel qualified\
  \ to learn an entirely new city.  Not to mention that my international phone plan\
  \ had just expired and I had no way of using my phone\u2019s GPS.  I took the train\
  \ ride to review the directions I\u2019d written in my notebook at the beginning\
  \ of the summer.  It seemed pretty simple, my hostel was only 6 blocks away.  \n\
  \nSlowly the train pulled into the station, I grabbed my luggage and I confidently\
  \ followed my fellow passengers off the platform and out of the station.  I felt\
  \ that if I could convince everyone around me that I was confident in where I was\
  \ going and what I was doing then I\u2019d be okay, and I was until I realized that\
  \ I\u2019d walked out onto the wrong street.  I was on the exact opposite end of\
  \ the station from where I needed to be and it was too late to go back.  All I could\
  \ figure to do was to walk the perimeter of the train station and try to find the\
  \ street on which to begin my directions to the hostel.  Several taxis drove past\
  \ and I was tempted to get one, certainly that would be easier than trying to walk\
  \ to my hostel.  But I was already low on money after traveling all summer, and\
  \ it was only 6 blocks away.  Finally I turned left onto the street I was supposed\
  \ to have exited the station on.  I was back on course!\nI successfully followed\
  \ my scribbled directions all the way to my hostel, I had made it.  \n\nBeing alone\
  \ in a city I didn\u2019t know, and in a language I didn\u2019t speak was exciting\
  \ and I couldn\u2019t wait to tour the city."
