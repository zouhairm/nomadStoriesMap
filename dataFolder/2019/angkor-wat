Text: "My guide introduced himself as Chet. He was in his mid 20s, dressed like most\
  \ Cambodian men in a long sleeved collared shirt and long pants, and had a huge\
  \ smile that never seemed to leave his face. His English was good - certainly a\
  \ lot better than my Khmer. The van was air conditioned and as the temple complex\
  \ is only about eight kilometres from Siem Reap, the trip was short and comfortable.\
  \ We filled the time getting to know each other - and the other four people on the\
  \ tour - in that polite, generally superficial way people do on tours when they\
  \ know they're probably never going to see each other again. Chet told us he came\
  \ from a village about 30 minutes drive from Siem Reap. His family owned a small\
  \ rice farm and couldn't afford to send him to the English school in town so he\
  \ taught himself the language by speaking with tourists in the restaurant where\
  \ he used to work. Eventually he was proficient enough to land a job with the tour\
  \ company and do what he he said he loved to do best; tell people about the history\
  \ and culture of his country.\n\nAngkor Wat is the largest religious monument in\
  \ the world, covering an area of over 160 hectares. Originally constructed as a\
  \ Hindu temple dedicated to the god Vishnu, it was transformed into a Buddhist temple\
  \ towards the end of the 12th century. We started our tour at Angkor Thom which\
  \ Chet told us means \u201CGreat City\u201D. It served as the capital of the Khmer\
  \ Empire from the 12th century until the empire's collapse three centuries later\
  \ and covers an area of nine square kilometers. At the centre of the city is the\
  \ Bayon, built by King Jayavarman VII in the late 12th and early 13th centuries\
  \ to act as his state temple. Jayavarman was a Buddhist and the Bayon is the only\
  \ state temple in the Angkor complex built as a Mahayana Buddhist shrine, the remainder\
  \ being dedicated to one or more of the Hindu Trimurti.\n\nThe complex is surrounded\
  \ by a moat which is crossed by five bridges (even numbers are considered unlucky\
  \ by Buddhists Chet told us), each leading to a gate in the massive stone wall that\
  \ surrounds the site. We approached via the southern bridge which is lined with\
  \ statues on both sides, then passed through the impressive gate to reach the temple.\
  \ The large central tower is built on a rectangular terrace surrounded by smaller\
  \ towers, all of which are decorated with four serene, smiling heads that face towards\
  \ the four cardinal points. Around the base of the terrace are a string of elaborately\
  \ carved bas reliefs depicting successful battles against Jayavarman's enemies,\
  \ religious themes, as well as scenes from daily life in ancient Cambodia.\n\nOur\
  \ next stop was Ta Prohm, also built in the late 12th and early 13th centuries by\
  \ Jayavarman VII. Located approximately one kilometre east of Angkor Thom, it served\
  \ as a Buddhist monastery and university. There were a band of amputees who had\
  \ lost limbs to landmines playing by the side of the road on the way in. Sadly I'd\
  \ seen a lot of these orchestras already since arriving in Cambodia. Chet told us\
  \ that 6 million mines were laid during the civil war and that 1.5 million were\
  \ still unaccounted for. \n\nTa Prohm is very atmospheric and photogenic as it\u2019\
  s been left in much the same condition in which it was found with huge trees and\
  \ tree roots growing out of the ruins. It\u2019s probably most famous for serving\
  \ as one of the backdrops for the film Tomb Raider. There were a few ancient Buddhist\
  \ nuns in white robes scattered around the interior selling bracelets made from\
  \ orange and red cotton. Chet said these are supposed to bring good luck so to be\
  \ on the safe side I let one of the ladies tie one around my wrist. She murmured\
  \ a blessing as she did so. I left a couple of thousand Riel in the wicker basket\
  \ near her feet in exchange."
