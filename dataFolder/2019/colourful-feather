Text: "Most of us forget to watch the sunrise and the sunset when home. There\u2019\
  s so much to do: people have to wake up, go to work or to university, exercise,\
  \ read the newspaper, go to the supermarket etc.  There\u2019s no time to slow down\
  \ for a bit and enjoy a simple sunrise. This is what I was thinking while sitting\
  \ on a bench created from a broken palm tree in the beautiful park of Tayrona, Colombia.\
  \ With my eyes closed, my nose inhaling the salty air deeply, I waited for the sun\
  \ to come up from the infinite waves of the ocean. On the beach, just me and a guy\
  \ doing some yoga. My camera was ready to shoot the moment, I just had to wait a\
  \ few minutes more to see the red ball appear from the water. With my eyes still\
  \ closed, I enjoyed the silence of that desert beach. Suddenly, a lively voice made\
  \ me come back to reality. \u201CHey, you. Good morning!\u201D. Opening my eyes,\
  \ I realized that someone was just in front of me. A young guy smiled at me and\
  \ walked around my bench picking up rubbish. I didn\u2019t realize there were some\
  \ plastic bottles and some leftovers, too focused on the moment I didn\u2019t want\
  \ to miss. \u201CIs that your job, picking up rubbish?\u201D I asked in my decent\
  \ Spanish. \u201CNot at all. I\u2019m a tourist too. I just don\u2019t like to see\
  \ dirt in such a beautiful place. Birds and fishes die because they eat this, you\
  \ know. My name is Ricardo, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you\u201D. Ricardo sat\
  \ down and we enjoyed the sunrise in a solemn silence. I immediately felt at ease\
  \ with this stranger. After that magic moment, I decided to get to know him a little\
  \ bit better. Ricardo is Colombian and he\u2019s 24 like me. After his last exam\
  \ at university, where he\u2019s studying Forestry, he decided to take a break and\
  \ visit his own country. He didn\u2019t have any car nor money to spend, so he chose\
  \ to travel slow, walking around Colombia and reaching the cost on foot. His sheer\
  \ smile was as simple as the sunrise we watched together. I shared my breakfast\
  \ with him and listened to some stories about his simple lifestyle. He gave me a\
  \ colourful feather as a gift. \u201CWhen I walk in the forest, I always pay attention\
  \ to nature. She gives you presents, you know. Look what a beautiful feather I found!\
  \ It\u2019s for you, so you won\u2019t forget this morning during the trip you\u2019\
  re making\u201D. I looked at it with a big smile and shining eyes: a gift from nature!\
  \ Ricardo was as pure as a baby, and he looked extremely happy because he was sharing\
  \ his knowledge with me. That was his power, the power of love and friendship. Thanks\
  \ to him, Colombia became a place with no guns and no violence in that moment and\
  \ all the stereotypes I had about Colombians flew away like a cloud of butterflies.\
  \ We spent the morning together, he taught me where to find mangos in the forest\
  \ and how to pick them up. I borrowed him my camera to record those beautiful moments.\
  \ That was my last day in Tayrona. That was the most delightful and surprising day\
  \ in Colombia. After saying goodbye, I walked down the path to reach a bus station\
  \ and continue my journey. While waiting for the bus to come, I sat on the ground,\
  \ all wet because of the humidity of the jungle and the long walk. A big smile was\
  \ still shining on my face. I opened my travel journal to write a few pages about\
  \ this adventure in the park and I found a page written in red. Next to the feather\
  \ Ricardo gave me, he had written something for me, saying how grateful he was to\
  \ have met me and how powerful love is when kept sheer. A tear of joy fell from\
  \ my cheek. I closed the diary and got on the bus, no need to write anything else\
  \ but his dedication."
