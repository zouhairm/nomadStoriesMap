Text: After a continous 7 months of office without a vacation break, i was completly
  exhausted. I needed an escape to a totally unknown land, fully new atmosphere. A
  cut-off from the world for a time had become my dream. Suddenly i realised that
  i had never been to Goa, the land of water and i knew it would be the best place
  for me to be as sound of waves was the only thing that could calm me at that point
  in life. I made of necessary arrangments, took a flight and landed in Goa after
  two days. The air there was something different. Every bit of the atmos smelt wet-watery.
  From the airport started a calmness spa theray of my stress of last 7 months. I
  had choosen a sea facing hotel. I reached there within an hour of landing. It was
  near Candolim beach. Luckily Candolim is not a too crowded place and is suitable
  for the people who want to enjoy peaceful atmos, with soothin music coming from
  pubs near by, a romantic light surrounding the place and the steady music of waves.
  I could hold no longer to enjoy every ounce of it and went to the beach, sat there
  till early morning, came back to room and slept through the noon. After lunch, I
  went to Anjuna beach. It is famous for water sports and is a people place. In evening
  i relaxed in my room and at night went to candolim beach again. Nxt day went some
  local shopping and church visits but visiting candolim beach at night had become
  my daily worship for those 5 days in Goa. That experience gave me all the enegry
  i needed for a whole year of office work and charged me up. That escape to the land
  of water has been immensly memorable part of my memories and still runs through
  my veins
