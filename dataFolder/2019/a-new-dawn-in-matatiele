Text: "With the coming of age from time to time in December until January the air\
  \ in Matatiele is filled with cries of ululating. Matatiele is a town in the Eastern\
  \ Cape, north of Lesotho and Greater Kokstad to the east situated between vast farmlands\
  \ and mountains. In the apartheid era it used to be a part of Natal attracting traders\
  \ from the Transkei region and Lesotho. The town is now home mostly to the Sotho,\
  \ Xhosa and coloured people who developed rural settlement in and around it. Every\
  \ December I go back home to this place that keeps reintroducing itself to me in\
  \ not only its cultural diversity but also its growth. I travel from wherever I\
  \ stay throughout the year, and this time it is from Durban. That is the story of\
  \ most people in South Africa who have made a life in the cities away from home.\
  \ The three hour drive from Durban to Matatiele is a transition from Zulu land through\
  \ lush land to the heart of a variety of Xhosa tribes and Sotho people situated\
  \ there. All along the way there are commercial farms and endless beautiful scenery\
  \ of mountains and blue skies. It almost feels like these parts carry the air in\
  \ a refreshing way because nothing is too industrialized or manmade. The beauty\
  \ of the small town is that as much as it develops each year it does so slowly but\
  \ the greater parts of it remain untouched. The town has a golf club and a small\
  \ scale plot of land set out for animal safety. These are some of the ways to preserve\
  \ the wildlife and biodiversity of the Drakensberg and Maluti Mountains. This involves\
  \ development planning, conservation and sustainable land use and the use of resources.\
  \ \nMy family settled in Mahangwe, a village about an hour away from town. It is\
  \ an hour because there are no gravel roads as you branch into the entry that leads\
  \ to Mahangwe and Zwelitsha. Time also moves at its own pace here, from the transport\
  \ system which is a bus or mini buses shuttling residents from between Zwelitsha\
  \ and Mahangwe in one vehicle. As you enter the village there is a school between\
  \ the many houses and huts. In preparation for the return of the initiates and as\
  \ the village welcomes the return of city folk there is forever an air of celebration\
  \ around this time. The initiates go off to one of the mountains and the wild for\
  \ about a month trekking and hunting bare foot led by men who have already perfected\
  \ the practise. This ritual is a pivotal one in a young man\u2019s life and is discussed\
  \ and planned for from the time a son is born into the family. Young boys grow up\
  \ fantasying about it and imitating the celebratory shows as they play from time\
  \ to time. \nThere is nothing that brings a family closer together than an event,\
  \ the women cook and brew beer while the men slaughter and drink. I never expected\
  \ that one day I\u2019d watch my young relatives become men and it\u2019d bring\
  \ tears to my eyes. I have experienced this festivity a couple of times in my life\
  \ but it always feels new. After Christmas and New Year the group of about 80 boys\
  \ returned home to joyous cries of ululations. It is a whole affair as the men fancy\
  \ dress and indulge in stick fighting which is also believed to be a huge distraction\
  \ as some men hurry to fetch the initiates while the many spectators are busy watching\
  \ the show the other men are putting on. Early the next morning the scantily dressed\
  \ boys wake up early and perform a crossing over act of \u2018piercing the sun\u2019\
  \ using arrows and spit to mark a new dawn. They are now men, they run off to a\
  \ place set aside for them near a hill and their families are allowed to see them\
  \ for the first time. The families come to dress the initiates in Basotho blankets,\
  \ some jewellery and scarves. Then they spend about three days giving praise through\
  \ spoken word and singing to entertain their families. A goose bump causing show\
  \ to behold."
