Text: "For a short while there I was a pilgrim. I even carried a passport that identified\
  \ me as such.\n\nA peregrina with a heavy pack on her back and a pair of ugly \u2013\
  \ but sturdy and trustworthy and supportive \u2013 hiking boots on her feet.\n\n\
  And that was what defined me.\n\nFor 14 days in September my life took on a simple\
  \ rhythm: Walk. Eat. Sleep. Repeat. As someone had so eloquently carved out on a\
  \ Galician forest pine we passed.\n\n(Side note: why do humans always need to leave\
  \ their mark?)\n\nThe goal was Santiago de Compostela. The Way was marked with yellow\
  \ arrows. And all we had to do was follow them closely.\n\nI realised quite early\
  \ on that no one stumbles onto the Camino by accident.\n\nJust like the penance-seeking\
  \ pilgrims of old, each of us had some ache, some question, some burden that nothing\
  \ but a very long walk could soothe.\n\nAnd soothe it did.\n\nIn the almost 240km\
  \ between Porto and Santiago, everything that had become so tightly coiled over\
  \ the years, so cramped and confined, so afraid, started to unfold and there was\
  \ space again. To breathe and to dream, to hope and to accept.\n\nAt an albergue\
  \ in Tui my face wash started leaking, so I threw it away.\n\nOn hot days I wore\
  \ shorts and didn\u2019t care about the way my legs dimpled and drilled, as I always\
  \ do back home.\n\nAnd whenever I encountered a mirror, I tried not to find fault\
  \ but instead smiled at the way my face and arms and hands had rekindled their infatuation\
  \ with the sun.\n\nIt was a sense of freedom that drew me to the Camino. And it\
  \ was freedom that I found. In a pack that routinely chafed my shoulders and hips,\
  \ in feet that cramped and blistered, in the simple act of taking one step and then\
  \ another and then a thousand more.\n\nOf course the journey wasn\u2019t easy, but\
  \ as with all pilgrimages, the real challenge lies in the return. Clinging to the\
  \ Truth you walked so far to find.\n\nKnowing that memories fade all too quickly\
  \ these days, get lost on our phones and in our feeds, I decided to take an old\
  \ Pentax film camera with me and fell slowly, but deeply in love with that characteristic\
  \ click-and-whirr that came with every moment captured.\n\nThe anticipation. The\
  \ delayed gratification. The knowing that they will be far from perfect, but that\
  \ that\u2019s okay too."
