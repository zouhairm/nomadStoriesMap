Text: "- It\u2019s cancer.\n\nI\u2019ve heard this from my doctor\u2019s eyes, after\
  \ a four hour surgery. Just like the hospital room decoration, all the colours run\
  \ away from the bad news.\n\nAt this moment, I wasn\u2019t allowed to express myself.\
  \ The nasogastric tube in my nose and the stitches in the tongue made me - literally\
  \ - unable to talk, to express myself or to eat.\n\nLiving some months of ups and\
  \ downs and I\u2019ve finally got the diagnosis nobody wants. Our society is afraid\
  \ of cancer because they relate it straight to death.\n\nBut there\u2019s something\
  \ I fear more. In my point of view, the lack of freedom it's worse than death. And\
  \ travel is my form of freedom.\n\nThe first idea after packing my thoughts, was\
  \ to find an opportunity to convert cancer into travel. \n\n- After all this ends,\
  \ I\u2019ll go straight to New York City. - my brain said to my soul.\n\nThe plan\
  \ was converting the hospital bill into travel miles. Using my intuitive math, the\
  \ credit card could help. It did.\n\nIn the next day I\u2019ve got another bad news:\
  \ my father was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and died five months later. I\
  \ was in the worse moment of my life and facing the loss of the freedom and people\
  \ I love.\n\nIf an apple a day keeps the doctor away, the Big Apple every year means\
  \ self healing forever. Everytime I land in New York City I feel connected to my\
  \ dreams, to myself and people that I love.\n\nThat\u2019s why I go there every\
  \ year, since my diagnosis. New York made me learn the difference between travel\
  \ and tourism. Travel makes anywhere not enough, no matter how many times you\u2019\
  ve been there. Tourism is different: you\u2019re satisfied after checklisting. You\
  \ lose your first-timer eye.\n\nI was in New York in the winter of 2017 to celebrate\
  \ Ana's birthday. We were born in the same day, in the same year, but not the same\
  \ month - and we both had the cancer episode in our lives. The plan was to travel\
  \ during her metastasis treatment gap.\n\nNew York is It\u2019s the only place I\
  \ go that I can compare to life itself. The more I know about the city, more I feel\
  \ ignorant about it. And more I want to discover. Sometimes I go there with some\
  \ different company, to blend my googly eyes with theirs.\n\nAll the colours comes\
  \ back.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a blue sky like that in New York City.\n\nThe green\
  \ of Central Park was replaced by the white overload in the Sheep Meadow. The snow\
  \ covered every spot of my tropical background. It was completely surprising for\
  \ an average coast-brazilian.\n\nThe snow was only on the ground, making our days\
  \ so pleasant to reach every corner of NYC neighborhoods. We were so hungry for\
  \ that moments that we\u2019re able to cross the Brooklyn Bridge, enjoy a Levain\
  \ cookie and stare a flaming sunset on the top of Rockefeller Center in a few hours\
  \ - even with the shorter winter days.\n\nI told Ana that we should celebrate her\
  \ private New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\n- Let\u2019s go to Times Square before midnight.\
  \ It will snow. - I told her.\n\nI had no guarantees, we will never have in life\
  \ at all. But we felt the lightness of each snowflake in our noses like kisses from\
  \ the clouds. A small blessing from the unknown who protects us. Crystals transmuted\
  \ into tears and the snow showered few minutes before Ana\u2019s birthday.\n\nWe\
  \ cried alone for different reasons and together for the same happiness.\n\nIn the\
  \ next day Ana flew to Canada to see her family. I stayed in NYC for one more day.\n\
  \n- It was the first. I don\u2019t know if was the last one. But I just wanted you\
  \ to know that was perfect. - Ana jumped in the shuttle van and said the words why\
  \ a deep smile.\n\nI waited the driver to close the door and the van cross the street.\
  \ I\u2019ve tried to hold on, but remembered I\u2019ve never cried alone at 7th\
  \ Avenue. Apple flavoured tears.\n\nI go to New York and I remember my healing.\n\
  \nI remember my meaning."
