Text: "Waiting in the NBA Store on 5th Avenue in NY on a sunny day in July 2017, eagerly\
  \ watching an NBA customised jersey being made. Everything was going according to\
  \ plan. Until I got out of the taxi in front of the hotel. Things took a u-turn\
  \ for the worse. I went into my hotel room and checked out my newly made jersey.\
  \ It was specially made for my cousin who I haven't seen in 5 years. I hoped he\
  \ loved the Bucks Jersey with his name printed on the back. \n\nI went into my room,\
  \ checked out the jersey and was really happy a about the choice. I reached into\
  \ my pocket to grab my phone. I wanted to message cousin to confirm dinner plans\
  \ that night. My phone wasn't there, checked other pocket, wasn't there either.\
  \ Checked every corner of the room, hoping I would find it, no luck. I was freaking\
  \ out, my phone was the only piece of electronic, I had taken on that trip. My heart\
  \ rate crept up  as every minute went by.  I had no choice but to backtrack my path,\
  \ to figure out where I had lost it.\n\nI had it while in store, I then took a taxi\
  \ to the hotel, had it then, did I lose it in the taxi or on my way to the hotel\
  \ room. After the hotel staff confirmed it wasn't found in the hotel, the taxi was\
  \ my last hope. I tried calling the phone, no luck. Last ditch resort, I messaged\
  \ the phone indicating reward would be offered. It was  an android phone, so find\
  \ my iPhone was not an option. I waited for two hours, no response. Five hours after\
  \ I lost the phone, I got a call from reception, it was good new that my phone has\
  \ been found.\n\nI met the good samaritan that evening and handed him the reward\
  \ as promised. After I got my phone, I thanked him and clearly noticed that he looked\
  \ frail and unwell. We went to the nearest restaurant and started talking about\
  \ life. What he said next changed my life forever. He explained me that he hails\
  \ from Tel Aviv and here in NY for a kidney transplant operation. Incidentally he\
  \ had lost his phone while travelling on a taxi that morning, he was yet to find\
  \ his phone. He tried every avenue possible, even lodged a enquiry with Taxi commission.\
  \ The saddest part was he had all his American contacts on the phone, without it\
  \ he was totally lost. Listening to this made me emotional, then went onto explain,\
  \ 'I know what its like to lose my most important valuable, I never want another\
  \ person to have the same lost feeling as I did. This drew to tears and I couldn't\
  \ hold back. I offered to help find his phone and extended my trip to ensure I returned\
  \ the favour. I helped him contact the hospital and also raided facebook to help\
  \ find his relatives and get them in touch wit the good samaritan. I waited two\
  \ days until the transplant was done, I was over the moon, when doctors informed\
  \ the operation was a success. \n\nTo this day we keep in contact and him and his\
  \ family are visiting my home in Melbourne in Dec 2019, losing my phone was a blessing\
  \ in disguise, I got to meet a wonderful man who helped me change the way I viewed\
  \ the world. I will forever be thankful to him and in my view he's god's angel."
