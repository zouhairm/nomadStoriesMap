Text: "Imagine getting stuck in the middle of nowhere with a sick friend, 3 backpacks\
  \ and another injured friend. After some time on the way from the city of Cusco\
  \ to Puno, Per\xFA the bus stopped suddenly. \nThat day we climbed the amazing mountain\
  \ of Machu Picchu. One of my friends on the way felt sick and had to stay in the\
  \ nursery of the mountain, the other one injured herself trying to climb the mountain\
  \ too fast and I had to take care of them all day.\nTired after a long day we took\
  \ our train to the city of Ollaytaytambo and from there we took a car to the city\
  \ of Cusco, we tried to rest for a while before taking our final bus to the city\
  \ of Puno and enjoying the last day of the vacation.\nWhen we arrived to the terminal,\
  \ i had to help all my friends because they were still ill. We got on the bus with\
  \ many strangers but what we didnt know is that a few hours later they would turn\
  \ into amazing friends.\nFor the first hours in the bus i was taking care of my\
  \ friends, the bus stopped for the first time and we didnt know what was happening\
  \ but no one wanted to tell us why. The bus started moving again and after an hour\
  \ stopped for the second time. \nSo there we were, around 40 strangers in the middle\
  \ of nowhere inside a bus, we had been waiting around 2 hours there so we started\
  \ to talk with the people in the bus, first trying to guess what was wrong with\
  \ the bus and later just taking about life in general. Even though we were from\
  \ different countries and sometimes different continents we realized that we had\
  \ much more in common that different. We shared the food that we had and from one\
  \ moment to another we were like a family.\nAfter all that time the bus driver came\
  \ and said to us : \u201CThe bus has broken down so i am opening the door and you\
  \ can do what you want, good luck on your way to Puno\u201D.\nPeople started to\
  \ freak out, mothers and older people trying to scream and punch the driver but\
  \ this wasnt the solution. A Peruvian girl stood up and said to everyone that she\
  \ was sorry for the situation but if we worked together we would find a solution\
  \ for everyone. People then helped each other and once out of the bus we saw one\
  \ of the most beautiful views we ever had, mountains and a sky full of stars.\n\
  We took all the bags and stopped a little truck. We got inside and sat on the floor\
  \ but we werent mad or scared, we were enjoying the situation. We shared blankets\
  \ and the company of all the new friends. The truck left us un the city of Juliaca\
  \ and from there we took another bus to finally get to the city of Puno.\nAfter\
  \ such a big aventure the only thing i can say is you can take any bad situation\
  \ and make it positive, maybe it could been the worst trip ever but it finished\
  \ as the best trip of my life with new friends and many life stories shared. So\
  \ now what i am saying is if you ever get stuck in the middle of nowhere in Per\xFA\
  \ it can turn into the Best adventure of your life"
