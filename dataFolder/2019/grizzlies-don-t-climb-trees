Text: "On my way into Cody, the town at the base of that climb into Yellowstone, a\
  \ UPS man stopped his truck in front of me on the side of the road.  He flagged\
  \ me down and I stopped riding to chat.\n    \u201CHow's it goin?\u201D\n    \u201C\
  Good.  I've been keepin an eye on you today.  You're right on my delivery route.\u201D\
  \n    \u201COh yeah?\u201D I said.\n    \u201CYeah I figured I'd make sure you get\
  \ through this part alright.\u201D  He shifted his weight like a dad.  Those shorts\
  \ are short.  \u201CYou're gettin into grizz country.  You got a gun?\u201D\n  \
  \  \u201CNo.\u201D\n    \u201CBearspray?\u201D He asked.\n    \u201CNo.\u201D\n\
  \    \u201CWell you need to get yourself some protection.  I was camping with my\
  \ family the other year, and I had to pull out my glock on one of them.\u201D\n\
  \    \u201CDid you scare it away?\u201D I asked.\n    \u201CNo, I put a bullet in\
  \ his head.\u201D\n    \u201COh.\u201D\n\n    An hour later, I bought bear spray\
  \ in Cody.\n\n\n\n    I camped up in a tree next to Yellowstone Lake to give a minimal\
  \ distance between me and the man-eaters.  I hung my hammock about 65 feet up in\
  \ this 125 Fir tree.  I then found a small dead tree and lashed the sides to a crook\
  \ between a branch and tree on either side, using my tent's tie-downs.   I sat on\
  \ this limb and put my sleeping bag in the hammock.  On this pile, I set up my stove\
  \ and cooked dinner, feet dangling above the ground.  I've heard grizzlies can't\
  \ climb trees.  If that's true, this setup was ideal.  If they can, as I've also\
  \ heard\u2014I'd at least hear them coming.  I could mace them and throw branches\
  \ down at them (most of the trees' smaller branches were dry and dead.)\n    I also\
  \ had food in the unicycle.  Bears can smell even the aroma of last night's cooking\
  \ in clothing, so I took no chances.  I tied up my cross-country unicycle, named\
  \ Luna, and hung her upside down about 25 feet above the ground from a lower branch.\n\
  \    No bears came (which kind of disappointed me).  I was alone.  The temperature\
  \ dropped below freezing.  Hammocks are cold \u2013 especially with no rain fly\
  \ or covering.  I had put the tarp underneath my sleeping bag, the tent material\
  \ on top, but I still suffered.\n     I propped the little trunk of my pole-ladder\
  \ up against the trunk of the tree so that it acted like the pole version of a ladder,\
  \ with a few branch stubs to aid me.  I monkeyed up the trunklet, and its thinner\
  \ upper end bent under my weight.  It took me a couple tries to get it without pushing\
  \ it off or to the side of the Fir tree.  On the second try I fell from the top\
  \ of it, a good 20 feet of slo-mo pole vaulting failure.  By the fourth attempt\
  \ I had reached the big tree's first branch, and up I climbed.  I climbed up and\
  \ down a total of six times, raising gear each run.\n    I had set up my hammock\
  \ at a height of about 65 feet, or 7 stories.   Thick limbs flanked me, paralleling\
  \ the hammock.  One reached out along the right side of my hammock, making a perfect\
  \ armrest.  Another sprouted perfectly beneath me, which assured me a bit about\
  \ falling.  And a third branch sprouted just below that, forming with the other\
  \ two a sort of spiral staircase.  I could sit on the one below the hammock, lean\
  \ against the right one and set my feet on the lower one.  In this way I was able\
  \ to change clothes and shoes.\n    I say six times up and down to raise gear because\
  \ on the sixth I had what appeared to be everything.  I set everything up, hung\
  \ the unused gear, and nestled in to make dinner.  \n\n    \u201CThe spoon.  Dammit.\u201D"
