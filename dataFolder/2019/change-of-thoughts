Text: "I was born and grow up in the largest city in Brazil, S\xE3o Paulo, at 16 I\
  \ went through a drastic change to a city in Santa Catarina with 100% German colonization,\
  \ where people lived in the local German customs and most still knew how to speak\
  \ the language, regardless of age. With the fact that I did not like the change\
  \ I ended up letting everything around hurt me and as an innocent teenager, I ended\
  \ up blaming the culture of the people who for many times were bad with me for being\
  \ new in the city and also all different culturally. Years later, no longer living\
  \ there, I was invited to visit a friend who was studying in Holland and one of\
  \ the trips he planned in the travel itinerary was for Germany, and all the memory\
  \ of my problems in youth left me with a bad sensation with that part of the  itinerary,\
  \ and I kept complaining to him about it for a long time. Our trip was planned to\
  \ vistit seven countries, Switzerland, Holland, Italy, France, Belgium, London and\
  \ the dreaded Germany. Everywhere, especially in Germany, I knew what to expect,\
  \ I imagined scenes in the heads of the types of people, architectures, food, parties,\
  \ all set as a script in my head. I faithfully believed in finding a place with\
  \ closed, unfriendly people, a place not welcoming, an aura of bad humor, in every\
  \ corner, besides the food that I would not like at all, thinking that everywhere\
  \ they would only have pork, sauerkraut and cabbage, as I did when I was in the\
  \ city where I moved to 16. What I did not expect to find was exactly the opposite\
  \ of my traumatized teenage thinking. I did not expect to find the wonderful lakes\
  \ where I had the opportunity to feed the ducks, the museums that tell the story\
  \ of the luxury cars we so admire here in Brazil, did not expect to find people\
  \ so smiling and willing to help tourists, did not expect to make friends Germans\
  \ at parties, which I carry in my heart. A city so clean and welcoming, the pizzas\
  \ and hamburgers I ate were not even close to what I imagined I would have to eat\
  \ because I was in Germany. I really did not expect to fall in love with the country\
  \ that I was so afraid to go. Of all the travel itinerary done was the place I least\
  \ like to visit, which I would never include in a sightseeing tour. And now I can\
  \ say with all my heart that everything I did not expect happened. Germany left\
  \ me with a huge desire to return and a tremendous gratitude for the country that\
  \ I always misjudged and taught me that things are not always as we think."
