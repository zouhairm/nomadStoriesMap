Text: "The September Florida sun beat down on my back as I held on tight to the gunwale\
  \ of my canoe and peed off the other side of the vessel into the water. The surrounding\
  \ mangroves provided a bit of privacy and whenever anyone shouted, \u201CI\u2019\
  m taking a fifty!\u201D we all knew to avert our gaze.\n\nIt was the last day of\
  \ our new staff training expedition. We woke up on an island in the middle of the\
  \ Intracoastal waterway with nothing but some snacks and a note from our trainers\
  \ describing our final task: The five of us had to make it back before sun down.\
  \ \n\nSomeone in our group mentioned their growing hunger so we lashed up our canoes\
  \ and ate a gourmet lunch of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on pita bread. As\
  \ we floated along the coast we joked, played games, and sang songs.\n\nAppetites\
  \ sated, we unlashed our boats and continued to paddle.\n\nSometimes we\u2019d find\
  \ traveling companions in the form of dolphins or manatees. Those moments were extra\
  \ special.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon when we were no longer able to hug the\
  \ leeward side of the islands and would have to start facing the winds. We came\
  \ upon a particularly choppy section of water that kept trying to wash us ashore.\
  \ However, we prevailed.\n\n We made it to the canal that would lead us to the final\
  \ stretch of our journey. The end of the canal opened on a large body of water and\
  \ somewhere across the way was our boat ramp. \n\nAs we pulled out our maps and\
  \ shot our bearings, a group of manatees began to splash in the water about twenty\
  \ feet away. We marveled and then paddled away from the shore line to give them\
  \ their space. \n\nOnce we had agreed on where we were going, we took a moment to\
  \ appreciate how far we had come. The sun was shining, the manatees were frolicking,\
  \ the wind was at our backs\u2014and then it clicked. \n\nOne of the days earlier\
  \ in the expedition we had learned how to set up a sail with a tarp and MacArthur\
  \ poles so that we could sail instead of paddle. Our final stretch was a straight\
  \ shot across a massive body of water. \n\nOne by one it dawned on us that, theoretically,\
  \ we could sail back. With heavy arms and no hesitation, we lashed our three canoes\
  \ together\u2014forgoing the MacArthur poles\u2014and set up the tarp.\n\nOne person\
  \ was the rudder for our makeshift sail boat, two people stood in the back with\
  \ the sail connected to their paddles (I did this), and the other two used their\
  \ paddles to help keep the sail upright. The wind was blowing just enough to push\
  \ us forward. \n\nIt took us a while, but we were having fun and making progress.\
  \ We were getting close to the boat ramp where we would meet our trainers when the\
  \ wind died down and we heard a low rumble in the distance. Far off we could see\
  \ sporadic flashes of light. A storm was coming in.\n\nWe were stuck and tensions\
  \ started to rise. We all wanted to get back. We were hungry, tired of feeling dirty,\
  \ sleep deprived, and had an early morning the next day. It was half past six o\u2019\
  \ clock at this point and getting darker by the minute. Clouds were coming in faster\
  \ and it became not only a race against time, but also the weather.\n\nWe began\
  \ to squabble over whether we should keep the sail set up and hope for another gust\
  \ of wind to carry us in or if we should disband and paddle the rest of the way.\
  \ \n\nLuckily, we were saved by the winds and our quarrel was diffused. We sailed\
  \ up to the boat ramp, greeted by the cheers of our trainers. \n\nOur first meal\
  \ back was hamburgers. They were delicious. The shower I took before dinner was\
  \ hands down the best shower of my life. \n\nWe made it. Bug bitten, tanned, bruised,\
  \ and fully confident that there was more in us than we knew."
