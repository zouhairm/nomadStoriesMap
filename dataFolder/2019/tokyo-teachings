Text: "Having just moved back to my homeland of Indonesia, I was at a state of loss.\
  \ It was December of 1998, and the only exciting thing for me at that time was the\
  \ fact that Japanese gaming giants Nintendo had just released a franchise that we\
  \ all know to this day as Pok\xE9mon; short for Pocket Monsters. To me, Pok\xE9\
  mon were everywhere and everything. They were there for me in my time of culture\
  \ shock; when I couldn't talk to anyone about anything. I'd just turn on the gaming\
  \ console, hang my head, and focus my eyes on the screen. It wasn't long before\
  \ cable TV was introduced into my life, and my eyes could finally gaze away from\
  \ the console screen. \n\nNaturally, I'd search for programs near and dear to my\
  \ heart. Therefore, cartoons it was! Thanks to the wonders of wires, I came across\
  \ Japanese cartoons named \"Anime\", and I felt like I struck gold. It opened up\
  \ a whole new world to me... mostly because it was in a different language. \n\n\
  Fast forward 17 years, and there I was in the exact same spot I was 17 years before;\
  \ at Soekarno-Hatta airport, only this time the mood was different. Instead of walking\
  \ out into the International arrivals section, I was walking into the International\
  \ Departures gate, with a huge smile on my face and a half-packed suitcase in anticipation\
  \ of all the trinkets and toys I'd be buying. Yes, it was my first trip to the land\
  \ of the rising sun.\n\nThe whole plane ride, I couldn't sleep and even teared up\
  \ on occasion. I was unable to hold back the waterworks when we finally landed;\
  \ luckily the cold autumn wind wiped them away quick. Stepping into the public train\
  \ that would take me and my friends to our AirBNB in the Chiba area (just a bit\
  \ outside of Tokyo), I could feel the energy radiating from the locals although\
  \ they were still and silent, heads bowed down and eyes glued to their phones. It\
  \ was 10PM and we finally arrived at our AirBNB; a quaint duplex with a basement\
  \ room and open garage, where we'd spend most of our nights drinking our vending\
  \ machine cans and eating our minimarket bentos. \n\nQuiet mornings were spent zig-zagging\
  \ across the neighborhood, until we finally came to the bustling train station,\
  \ which took us to an even crowder Tokyo Central Station; the mecca of all train\
  \ hubs. The fast paced-ness of the Japanese was contagious, pushing me to walk faster\
  \ and not waste a single second of my trip. Once outside the shelter of the station,\
  \ there it was; Tokyo, my personal city of dreams. The narrow, store-filled streets\
  \ were always busy with people rushing in and out; both locals buying everyday needs\
  \ and wide-eyed tourists gawking at Japanese novelty. No two stores were the same.\n\
  \nHowever, the favorite had to be the tall Anime-laden buildings, with what seemed\
  \ like endless floors of Japanese cartoon merchandise. Rainbow-colored haired, cosplay-dressed,\
  \ leather-booted, trinket-wearing folks rushed up and down the stairs as if searching\
  \ for lost treasures, chatting along the way as they shared each of their store\
  \ findings. Their childlike mannerisms and expressions of joy could be seen as they\
  \ giggled while glancing at me as I passed the lanes filled with accessories and\
  \ dolls. I felt so... ordinary and underdressed. Little did I know that the people\
  \ in Japan really did live out loud as they did in their Animes. However, this aura\
  \ changed when I stepped outside again; all I saw were people radiating serenity\
  \ and simplicity, trying not to talk so much. Especially in public transportation;\
  \ apparently talking on the phone was frowned upon! What seemed at first was some\
  \ sort of automatic switch suddenly dawned on me; it was purely civility.\n\nWhen\
  \ I first planned this trip to Japan, I was expecting to return home with bags filled\
  \ with Anime and Pok\xE9mon merchandise. I did not expect to come across an eye-opening\
  \ lesson on the Japanese balance of expression and emotion; and how that is probably\
  \ the key to upholding such a proud country."
