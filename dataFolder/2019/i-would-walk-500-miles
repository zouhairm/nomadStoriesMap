Text: "The Camino seems like a far-away dream at this point. A dream that I wish I\
  \ hadn't woken up from. To think that just two years ago, I was a pilgrim; walking\
  \ an average of 10 miles a day from pueblo-to-pueblo or city-to-city.  Although\
  \ it's been a little while since I stepped foot in Santiago de Compostela, Spain,\
  \ the celebrated finish line of the Camino de Santiago de Compostela Pilgrimage,\
  \ I vividly remember that very moment and everything I had worked for up until then\u2026\
  \ the blood (literally, the unearthly blisters!), the sweat and tears that went\
  \ into walking those 500 miles (800 km) from St. Jean-Pied-Du-Port (eastern side\
  \ of the Pyrenees mountain range), France to the Galician City of Santiago de Compostela\
  \ in northwestern Spain. All worth it, along with a picture in front of the famous\
  \ cathedral and a Compostela (certificate) to document this feat I completed.\n\n\
  Being on the Camino is like no other feeling. You will hear most pilgrims say, \u201C\
  the Camino changes you.\" I believe this is because you feel completely liberated.\
  \  Your only concerns include walking, stopping in the towns, pueblos, and cities\
  \ in-between to nourish yourself and take breaks, and finding shelter at the end\
  \ of the day. There is virtually no worrying about day-to-day errands or tasks,\
  \ or rushing to work, or taking care of specific responsibilities. It is just 'you'\
  \ and whatever you define as the finish line, along with the space to focus on yourself\
  \ in-between. No white noise (minus the snoring in the albuerges); just you and\
  \ the Camino.\n\nNow imagine transitioning from that feeling, which lasted (me)\
  \ an entire six weeks, and abruptly returning back to the real world of a 9-5 schedule\
  \ with the same prior responsibilities, if not more. It felt like I went 0 MPH to\
  \ 100 MPH, overnight. It was a complete counter culture shock. A few pilgrims I\
  \ spoke with appeared to have a decent post-Camino honeymoon period, as they reconnected\
  \ with friends and family to share their Camino experiences. I didn\u2019t feel\
  \ this way. Personally, I didn\u2019t want to talk about my experience, other than\
  \ to say it was \u2018amazing\u2019 and you should watch \u2018The Way\u2019 or\
  \ \u2018Six Ways to Santiago\u2019 if you are truly interested in finding out more.\
  \  I didn\u2019t want to keep reminiscing, because when I did, part of me felt this\
  \ grief or loss over the fleeting feeling of the sacred space I had for those six\
  \ weeks.\n\nLife on the Camino is so simple, so easy. Yes, you have to sometimes\
  \ deal with blisters, joint pain, lack of sleep, and maybe some bland food.  But\
  \ you are carrying a backpack of 10-20 pounds of all of your belongings, and realize\
  \ that\u2019s all you really need. Living in the USA, and in this day and age, I\
  \ definitely feel pressured to buy, and sometimes confuse my wants and needs. In\
  \ addition, while on the Camino, you aren\u2019t generally inundated with technology,\
  \ social media, instant gratification, full-time jobs, information overload. You\
  \ are off the grid, you are a minimalist, you are present and in the moment with\
  \ what you are doing.\n\nThe life-changing experience and realizations I had, were\
  \ paired with the frustration of not having the changes I wanted to see in my life\
  \ come to fruition quickly enough.  The thing I was trying to get away from and\
  \ change were all still here, in the real world. For the longest time, all I could\
  \ think about was returning to the Camino, the same Camino I cursed day after day\
  \ for the physical and sometimes emotional struggle it gave me. The peace and serenity\
  \ I found within it. I went into a post-Camino depression."
