Text: "Tong, tong, tong.\nShe stood in front of us, banging on her gourd. The voice\
  \ of the gourd echoed across the temple as the monk began her incantation. \n\u201C\
  Suri, suri, ma suri,\u201D her voice crackled from the loudspeaker. Knees crouched\
  \ and cramping, I stared down at the glossy, wooden floor. It must have been recently\
  \ varnished since \n\nI peered upwards. Buddha stared down at me, his eyes peering\
  \ down at me in slits. I looked back down. \n\nThe white cloth slowly started dancing,\
  \ its creases unraveling as the smoke caught on. It was a pathetic dance, its edges\
  \ flopping left and right and then crumpling in against its own weight. Flames flickered\
  \ and slowly made way, enveloping the mountain of cloth. The white quickly disappeared,\
  \ as if the fire had stained it, grabbed it, and threw it into the heavens with\
  \ its smoky fingers. The embers flew into the sky, defying the heavy humidity that\
  \ seemed to hold us down in its sweaty grasp. The monk kept on hitting her monotonous\
  \ drum, each tong, tong, tong equivalent to the buzz of a mosquito. I swatted the\
  \ air, as if to brush away the sound into silence. Soon the cloth was only charred\
  \ bits of gravel and the monk announced that he, my grandfather, had ascended safely\
  \ up to the skies. \n\nI could see the dress shirt stick to the lake of sweat pooling\
  \ on my cousin\u2019s back. Each family member had a little rainstorm draining down\
  \ their face. One cousin\u2019s cakey foundation coagulated, my uncle struggled\
  \ to push up his glasses up on the ridge of his nose, and I kept on itching my back,\
  \ as each droplet of perspiration felt like ants crawling down. My feet started\
  \ to cramp and I felt like I was wearing a damp mop. Slowly, I bent my right knee\
  \ so that I could feel the blood flowing in my leg. Just as I was stretching it,\
  \ my toes cracked. The monk glared at me.\n\nI looked up at the flaming mess. To\
  \ the side, was a portrait of my grandfather, smiling. It was taken six or seven\
  \ years ago, when he had maintained his faux, upkept black hairdo. It felt weird\
  \ seeing his face there and knowing that now he wasn\u2019t really anything. He\
  \ was just an image. No beads of sweat, no sticky shirts, or damp pants. It was\
  \ as if he was in an air conditioned world, too far up there, wherever \u201Cthere\u201D\
  \ was. \n\n\u201CTong, tong, tong, tong, tong,\u201D the gourd drum rang. For some\
  \ god forsaken reason, I just wanted to pick that drum and chuck in it into the\
  \ mountain tops facing us."
