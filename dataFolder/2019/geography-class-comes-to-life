Text: "Growing up in Australia, learning about volcanoes, tectonic plates and glaciers\
  \ always felt so foreign. We usually learnt about these things through a textbook\
  \ and a documentary of some kind. I would always imagine how cool it would be to\
  \ see all these marvels in real life.\n\nOn a recent trip to Iceland, my high school\
  \ geography class came to life. I drove past lava fields that never seemed to end,\
  \ snow capped mountain ranges in all their majestic glory (it was my second time\
  \ ever seeing snow!), melting glaciers and gushing waterfalls. It hardly seemed\
  \ real. I lost count of the number of times I shouted 'wow!' (at every sight basically)\
  \ or smiled in pure joy. \n\nThere is a certain kind of magic that exists when you\
  \ view the wonders of the natural world. It is a feeling I cannot describe- something\
  \ between calm and wonder. After standing in front of a glacier or feeling the force\
  \ of a waterfall as you stand behind it, you become aware of your own insignificance.\
  \ \n\nI felt this magic most strongly when I went snorkelling in the Silfra. Now\
  \ snorkelling in Iceland is hardly a phrase that goes- I have to admit the first\
  \ time I heard about I raised an eyebrow. Swimming in two degree water did sound\
  \ slightly nuts. As I read more about it, the more amazing the experience seemed\
  \ to become. Snorkelling between two tectonic plates in the clearest water seemed\
  \ like a once in a lifetime opportunity. So I booked it. \n\nOn the day of the swim,\
  \ the temperature was a cool one degree, one degree cooler than the water temperature\
  \ I was about to swim in. As I was getting all my gear on (base layers, a jumpsuit\
  \ and a drysuit) all I kept thinking about was what I would see underneath. After\
  \ getting geared up, the group headed down to the entry point to the Silfra and\
  \ off we floated away. \n\nAs soon as I entered the water, my hands froze yet the\
  \ cold disappeared. I couldn't believe how clear the water really was! I was floating\
  \ down a rift between two plates being carried by the current and witnessing hues\
  \ of blue I didn't know existed. At this moment, the only sound I could hear was\
  \ my own breathing. I felt like a fish. I saw green algae, big rocks, small rocks,\
  \ shallows and depths. The thirty minutes of being in the water felt like a wonderful\
  \ dream. It was a sense of wonder and calm, a bliss from another world. I could\
  \ hardly believe that this was really me doing this. Yet I was. \n\nI exited the\
  \ water and yelled out 'wow!' (again), transported back into the world above forever\
  \ transformed. I had not expected to find the awe and sense of freedom that I did\
  \ floating down the Silfra. \n\nNo matter how much you read or however many videos\
  \ you watch about the world, nothing will ever beat real life experience. Mother\
  \ nature is guarantees to surprise you no matter how much you think you know. Now\
  \ that is magic."
