Text: "I remember the rain, unusual for a late spring evening, as the first of many\
  \ absurd circumstances. I was in the middle of my twenty second year of life and\
  \ Erasmus traineeship in Valencia - Spanish house of 'paella' and 'fallas'. It was\
  \ just perfect, except I was hating it.\nThat day I was honestly hating all of it.\
  \ The post office entrance, closed for an undefined but definitely non-serious reason.\
  \ The guy throwing his trash on the dumpster and missing it, careless of turning\
  \ back to collect banana peels and greasy paper off the ground. The grocery store\
  \ cashier, who gave me the change back with the same speed of those old Windows\
  \ \u201898\xAD that loaded an Internet Explorer page in time for a change of wardrobe.\
  \ \nWhen it started to heavily rain, my rage got worse, so I decided to sit on a\
  \ covered bench and call my mum. \nWhile the phone was ringing, I heard a high\xAD\
  -pitched voice from behind.\n\n\u201CYou go Carlos, if you want to!\u201D\nShe was\
  \ an overweight woman with wet, faded blonde hair and a black leather bag. Standing\
  \ next to her a skinny, wrinkled old man holding a grey umbrella. He talked, but\
  \ all I could hear was her reply.\n\u201CNo, I don\u2019t wanna go there, it\u2019\
  s raining. I\u2019ll wait here, next to this young lady.\u201D\nThe man nodded back\
  \ and crossed the street, while she looked at me and sat down.\n\u201CWhat a bore!\
  \ Trust me, don\u2019t ever get married. He\u2019s a good man but a real pain in\
  \ the ass.\u201D\nI hesitated, and she noticed I was still holding up the phone.\
  \ \n\u201COh sorry, you keep doing your thing.\u201D\n\u201CNo worries.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Oh, you\u2019re not Spanish. Where do you come from?\u201D\nI said I was born in\
  \ Sardinia, an Italian island, and she looked shocked. \n\u201CSardinia! I went\
  \ there many times, so beautiful. But I love you people even more. Your loyalty\
  \ and kindness are rare to find elsewhere.\u201D \nI didn\u2019t dare admitting\
  \ I\u2019d been having killer instincts all day.\n\u201CI\u2019m from Sagunto. Small\
  \ town nearby, nothing special. I left when I was eighteen, came here to work as\
  \ a teacher. I\u2019ve missed it so much since I retired. Teaching is the biggest\
  \ love of my life after beer.\u201D\nI tried to hold a laugh, but she didn't notice.\t\
  \t\t\t\n\u201CSome students keep visiting, but it\u2019s not the same. One asked\
  \ me to baptize her son, but I said no way, too much pressure. She was nice to ask\
  \ anyway. Another one was a smart kid who knew everything about computers. I told\
  \ his parents to send him abroad and now he\u2019s working at Google. He writes\
  \ me mails but I hardly reply. I prefer it this way. I love them but my job is done,\
  \ they have to keep doing their things.\u201D\nShe joined hands and took the first\
  \ pause since we started talking.\n\u201CI think I did right in never giving a grade\
  \ away. My students knew they had to fight for culture - but everything they got\
  \ at the end of the year, they knew they earned it. A teacher can always do more,\
  \ but I guess regret is the first step towards death, right?\u201D\t\nI nodded with\
  \ a smile as her husband was coming back to the bench, holding a bag with the new\
  \ purchase. \nShe then leaned towards my ear and whispered \u201CI\u2019m telling\
  \ you, don\u2019t get married before you\u2019ve travelled enough and learned how\
  \ to be an independent woman. That\u2019s the biggest present you can give yourself.\
  \ It was very nice to meet you, dear.\u201D \nShe pinched my cheek and stood up,\
  \ before reaching the man\u2019s arm under the umbrella and disappearing behind\
  \ the bench. \n\nAbsurd circumstances. \nIt took me a Spanish lady, a missed call\
  \ and a bit of rain to understand I wanted to be a writer. \nAnd even if it\u2019\
  s the first step towards death, I regret I didn\u2019t say \u201CNice to meet you\
  \ too\u201D."
