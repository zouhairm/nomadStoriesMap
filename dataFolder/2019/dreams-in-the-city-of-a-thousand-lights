Text: "In 2015, I decided to give me a special birthday present: a trip. I wanted\
  \ to go to John Crowder\u2019s mystical school for a long time. I choose the three\
  \ days conference in Henderson, Nevada, few days before my birthday, so perfect!\
  \ I bought the flight and booked one night in a cheap hostel in Vegas. \n\nI arrived\
  \ in the afternoon, when the light of the sun starts shining gold. The shutter driver\
  \ was a nice man who gave me a little tour before my destination, lucky me I was\
  \ his last stop. I shared the room with a Venezuelan girl and a Chinese girl. Meanwhile\
  \ we introduced ourselves, we dress up and put on some make up to go to The Strip.\n\
  \nWe began the walk with a picture in the bridge next to the fountain enlighten\
  \ with white light at Wynn imperfect dreams theme hotel. We enjoyed the warm weather\
  \ of Italy, at the Venetian; I appreciated its architecture and the gondola rides\
  \ in the blue water, while we share our plans in the city. We stopped in the greek\
  \ style fountain for a picture. Then we arrived to Paris, where I took the classic\
  \ selfie with an interesting perspective in front of the Eiffel tower. We moved\
  \ to the Lombardy region in Italy and appreciated the dancing water of Bellagio\u2019\
  s fountain. We talked about our country in the latin atmosphere of Miami at Flamingo\u2019\
  s Hotel. Fortunately, I saw the best chocolate store in the country, my sense of\
  \ smell was delighted by the intense scent. I bought a big dark chocolate ice cream,\
  \ exquisite! We continued meeting each other, during the walk toward the big wonder\
  \ wheel. I felt like in a warm beach in the tropical zone in Mandalay Bay, where\
  \ we took a cruise to the Polynesia in Mirage. I traveled in time to the medieval\
  \ age in Europe at Excalibur; then to the Roman Empire at Caesars Palace; and, the\
  \ ancient Pyramids of Egypt in Luxor. We came back to the present by drinking a\
  \ Turkish coffee in the Eastern World at Waldorf Astoria and celebrated freedom\
  \ with a frapp\xE9 and donut from Starbucks at the Statue of Liberty in New York.\
  \ Lots of pictures, jokes, laughs... great night! Next day, I had the best italian\
  \ lasagna in town with white wine and ice cream for breakfast. Then I picked up\
  \ my beginners package in Machine Guns Vegas attraction, where I killed the zombie\
  \ more than ten times. And after a couple of buses & walks & shopping stops, I arrived\
  \ to the conference. Las Vegas was like a good dream.\n\nHoly Spirit yelled at me\
  \ \u201Cask her!\u201D, when I was wondering where to stay. So I asked this beautiful\
  \ woman to host me. She said yes. She lives in a beautiful condominium with a golf\
  \ course in the backyard. At the moment I put my feet out of the car, I recognized\
  \ the place from a dream I had months ago. The warm night, the garden, the houses,\
  \ the entrance to the apartment\u2026. It was a surreal feeling! She is a talented\
  \ artist. The decoration in her house is very creative. My bedroom had a couple\
  \ of incredible paintings that talked about God\u2019s love for his sons and daughters.\
  \ The paintings emanated Love, literally!\n\nThe conference was very interesting,\
  \ fresh teaching and amazing testimonies. She took me for a walk to the Red Rock\
  \ Canyon, a National Conservation Area and to an art gallery in a mall. We shared\
  \ pleasant conversations and nice meals. We had a movie night with muffins and coffee.\
  \ I met her beautiful family. She showed me her paintings and explained me the interpretation\
  \ of each one of them. She gave me some postcards with her art. She prepared me\
  \ a special goodbye delicious meal and took me to the airport. One day I celebrated\
  \ her birthday with her family, pizza and cake; and the next day I celebrated mine\
  \ with my family, jello and cake.\n\nAmazing trip in the city of a thousand lights."
