Text: 'I have lived in Pekanbaru for 12 years. For those of us who live in Pekanbaru,
  if you want to recreation, going to Padang will be our first choice. For the first
  time I traveled to Padang in 2017, even though the distance between Pekanbaru and
  Padang was not far away. Bad right? But for me it doesn''t matter, at least I was
  finally able to visit Padang. Because there are so many beaches in Padang and basically
  I really like the beach, the trip to Padang for the first time has made me deeply
  in love.

  There I also learned to dive for the first time. Diving makes me feel like dancing
  in the sea. So fun, so beautiful, so peaceful, so free, so memorable. For the first
  time, the water I feared made me feel immeasurable happiness.

  Then my eyes are also spoiled by beautiful scenery everywhere.

  I was also able to find dolphins and sea turtle camp conservation there.

  All the first experiences that I experienced in Padang made me miss Padang very
  much and always hoped to visit Padang again, even if there was an opportunity I
  might want to settle in Padang so that I could welcome everyone to visit Padang.

  I am sure you will also like Padang.

  So see you there at Padang, Indonesia.'
