Text: "The day after our ship, the M.V. World Odyssey, pulled into the port of Casablanca\
  \ my friend Linda and I took a train to meet a man neither of us knew in a city\
  \ a couple of hours away. I was hesitant about setting out on this excursion because,\
  \ apart from not speaking any French or Arabic, I had heard that Morocco could be\
  \ a tricky place for women to travel, due to street harassment. In fact, as if to\
  \ solidify in my mind the risk associated with traveling in Morocco, before disembarkation\
  \ in Casablanca, the shipboard community was treated to a safety debrief by the\
  \ U.S. Department of State. \n\nThe State Department representatives spoke at length\
  \ about the violent crimes reported in Morocco. These included store robberies conducted\
  \ at sword-point. That\u2019s right, sword-point! They also discussed how the Moroccan\
  \ government broke up terrorist cells on a weekly basis. \n\nNeedless to say, I\
  \ did not want my friend to travel alone through the perilous Moroccan countryside,\
  \ so I joined her. Majid, the man we were going to meet, was a work colleague of\
  \ Linda\u2019s father from the U.S., back in Morocco to visit his family.  \n\n\
  At the train station in Casablanca, which smelled of western fast food and Starbucks,\
  \ we got our tickets and stepped onto the platform just as the train pulled away.\
  \ The attendant did not speak any English and all we got from him in answer to our\
  \ questions was \u201Coui, oui, oui!\u201D\n\nEventually we figured out we could\
  \ get on a train to our destination within the hour, and we were on our way. \n\n\
  Upon arrival at our destination, the town of Kenitra an hour or so north of Rabat,\
  \ Majid, wearing a dark t-shirt and baggy jeans, approached us in the station -\
  \ we clearly stood out in the crowd. He introduced himself, giving off a comfortable\
  \ and easy vibe, and told us that his sister\u2019s place was just a short walk\
  \ from the station. We followed him out onto the street, a couple blocks into town\
  \ and then up a flight of stairs to the apartment. \n\nMajid\u2019s family pulled\
  \ us into the living room; a carpet lined space with soft couches on each wall and\
  \ a short table in the middle. There they served us traditional Moroccan mint tea.\
  \ Majid\u2019s sister and sister-in-law were comfortably dressed in sweats with\
  \ their hair uncovered. They did not speak English so our interactions with them\
  \ were limited to wide smiles and lots of nodding. Also present were Majid\u2019\
  s niece and nephew, about our age, they spoke a little English and we were able\
  \ to converse with them more fluidly. Majid did most of the talking, however, talking\
  \ with Linda about her father, translating for the other family members and asking\
  \ us questions. I sat back and listened, taking in the unfamiliar cadence of Arabic\
  \ and heavily accented English. \n\nAfter a while the women brought out the food.\
  \ They placed a gigantic platter on the table in the living room. It was heaped\
  \ with flavorful couscous, pieces of vegetables, and chicken. On the side there\
  \ was tomato salad and fresh bread. We all sat around the table on the floor and\
  \ dug in to the mound of food, eating with our hands and using pieces of bread to\
  \ scoop. After we demolished the pile of food, Majid offered to take us for a drive.\
  \ He drove, with me, Linda, his niece, and nephew in a borrowed family sedan. We\
  \ headed for the coast. \n\nWe stopped at an upscale hotel that had a terrace overlooking\
  \ the beach. There we pulled up chairs and ordered coffees. As we drank our coffee,\
  \ we took in the view of the beach stretching out in the distance and the Atlantic\
  \ pulling away towards America. \n\nThe countryside streamed past the train heading\
  \ for Casablanca, aglow with the setting sun, as Linda and I sat in silence, each\
  \ listening to our own music, and reflecting on what an unexpectedly lovely day\
  \ it had been."
