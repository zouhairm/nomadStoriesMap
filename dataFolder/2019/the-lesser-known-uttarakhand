Text: It was 2016,when I shifted from Mumbai to this beautiful and land of the gods
  Uttarakhand to only find myself bewitched,by the charm and mystery and a sense of
  peace which is interesting and intriguing.This place holds so many legends and tales
  of an era which is enticing.This land traces her roots to a time which only one
  cannot find in books,but one must travel to feel and sense and see the picture and
  only to realize that stories whispers from the echoes of her bosom.Uttarakhand a
  land of mountains and rivers and full of flora and fauna where the sunrise, is just
  makes you feel closer to the heavens and in the night and charismatic sounds of
  the flowing rivers puts you to sleep like a baby.This beautiful place is diversified
  by her people and their culture and in truth her people are very warm and friendly,here
  any traveller from any part of the world is welcomed with arms wide open.During
  my travel to few places, I must that never have seen such overwhelming warmth from
  the people and I never been so close to finding myself like never before.This is
  just a feeling which one must exprience in his/her lifetime and be at peace with
  oneself.
