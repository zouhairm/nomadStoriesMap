Text: "The background of the portugal trip would be a personal (duh) story about myself\
  \ on late 2018's\nAfter a few years working as an engineer on the outside of the\
  \ city and after throwing a few failed shots to get a foreign scholarship for a\
  \ master degree. I decide to quit my job and spend all my savings on an english\
  \ 1-year study on Ireland. \nMay be Im throwing away the great job I have today\
  \ and maybe Im not getting the scholarship for the master degree I really wanted...\n\
  but life is only one, and Im ready to be free to see the world (at least Europe)\
  \ after studying and working all my life, nothing wrong can happen, my big brother\
  \ will arrive later on 2019, everythings fine.\n\nSince the time I worked day and\
  \ night to pay my first flight to the south of Mexico (when I was 18) the dream\
  \ of seeing, learning and living the world has come into my soul to never leave.\n\
  \nDecision taken\nPlans made\nIreland school payed\nJob ready to quit\nThe flight\
  \ to Ireland was on December 8th.\n\nWho are we to decide whats next? \n\nWhat do\
  \ you do when your one and only brother pass away on an accident on November 4th?\n\
  \nWell I cant answer who are we, but I can call that you can't leave your parents\
  \ behind and escape to Europe right the way\n\nIt wouldn't be right\n... \n\nNow\
  \ here whould be the second chapter of the traveling story\n... but\nI dont really\
  \ feel like I can sell you the idea of why I deserve a trip to Portugal\nI dont\
  \ even know how to write properly in english \n\nIm sending the text now"
