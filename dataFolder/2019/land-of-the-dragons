Text: "My first encounter with the \u2018Dragon\u2019 was in front of a muddy toilet.\
  \ Ten feet long, big, ugly, and blood-lusted. Oh, yes! I was terribly scared. \n\
  It started when I sailed to the Island of curiosity surrounded by the sea, Komodo\
  \ Island. It was a pleasant habitat for the life of Komodo dragon or \u2018Ora\u2019\
  , called by the locals, the last living dinosaur on earth. On boarded with me, ten\
  \ other strangers who were searching for adventures. The journey was everything\
  \ a voyager's heart could wish for, from crystal-clear water to plenty of vantage\
  \ point in enjoying spectacular sky. It was a visual feast \u2013 an Instagram orgy\
  \ \u2013 much of it was surreal. \n\nFive hours from seeing the blue only, I started\
  \ to see some dotted greeneries from my room\u2019s window. It was 11 AM and I remembered\
  \ the captain said that we would arrive by 11 AM. Barefooted, I ran to the balcony,\
  \ seeing the how close we were to the island. \u201CWe almost arrived! Welcome to\
  \ Komodo National Park,\u201D a voice shouted. The warning bells ring loud during\
  \ our briefing with our guide. \u201CYou cannot go to the Island if you are wounded,\
  \ or in your period, Komodo is extremely sensitive to blood as it can smell blood\
  \ up to five miles,\u201D said the guide. I felt a twinge of gratitude that my body\
  \ had decided not to bleed that day.\n\nAs the ship reaching the shore, I lined\
  \ up happily then stepping out my feet to the island, of course with shoes covered\
  \ this time. Surrounded by almost vertiginous, arid and brown mountains, I tried\
  \ to recall where I have seen such landscapes before. The park itself was lovely,\
  \ dappled and full of interesting trees and plants. The path was flat and smooth\
  \ \u2013 it was not difficult to traverse. Walking inside the park entrance, a park\
  \ ranger then greeted us. He was a middle-age man, holding a long stick with a \u201C\
  V\u201D shape at the end. Once inside the park, following the ranger\u2019s steps,\
  \ I suddenly began to feel uneasiness \u2013pain\u2013 in my stomach. I briefly\
  \ excused myself to go to the restroom.\n\nJust like the beginning of a scary movie\
  \ scene, I realised that I was on my period, for God sake! Little did I know that\
  \ one Komodo has slowly creeped towards me, sensing for my blood. It was when I\
  \ opened the toilet door that I saw that pair of amber piercing eyes. It was just\
  \ like a one-on-one battle, I felt my blood ran through my veins. The time has just\
  \ stopped. Psychotic as it may portray, my childlike glee at the Indiana Jones-like\
  \ qualities of the adventure superseded my fear of Komodo dragon attack.\n \nI may\
  \ be intimidated but I was not a fool. I started to move side to side and that pair\
  \ of eyes following my movements. The attacks began almost immediately. The dragon\
  \ has come to me. I smacked it with my diving weight belt. It chewed at the lead\
  \ belt while I threw rocks at its head, all the while eyeing my bare feet. The dragon\u2019\
  s strong jaws can snap a man\u2019s leg in two and I knew the bite could be murderous.\
  \ A Komodo dragon\u2019s mouth is stewing with an estimated 60 different strains\
  \ of bacteria that can kill a person within hours of a bite. Trembling, I managed\
  \ to shout out for help. \n\nI did not remember on how many seconds or minutes have\
  \ passed by when I heard footsteps running towards me. I just knew that someone\
  \ has come to rescue. I knew that I was not alone. Several hours later, I was sitting\
  \ in my room, silently thinking, \u201CI WAS ATTACKED BY A DRAGON AND SURVIVED\u201D\
  . That could have been the difference between life and death. Just hoping that we\
  \ would never see each other again."
