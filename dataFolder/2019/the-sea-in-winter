Text: "\u201CWho on earth would go to the sea in winter?\u201D \n\nMy 14-year-old\
  \ self shakes her head in disbelief, her only concern whether to cool off in the\
  \ water or keep on frying for two more minutes. \n\nWhile the hot sun burns down\
  \ on a young skin, filled with the anticipation of a carefree summer, the rain is\
  \ lashing against my face. It\u2019s a whole life later. It\u2019s the end of December,\
  \ between the years, as we put it in German. I\u2019m standing in the empty square\
  \ in front of Asunci\xF3n de Santa Mar\xEDa, Lekeitio\u2019s Gothic basilica. Lekeitio\
  \ is my fourth stop on this short trip around the Spanish Basque Country. Today\
  \ is my 30th birthday. Today I\u2019m for the first time at the sea. Well, at least\
  \ for the first time in winter.\n\nThe tourist information is closed, I\u2019m checking\
  \ the internet for information. Located on the coast of Bizkaia, it says, Lekeitio\
  \ is a small fishing village formerly known for whaling, nowadays living from summer\
  \ tourism. \n\nThe word summer makes her sigh, and this sigh is contagious.  \n\n\
  I close my eyes, trying to picture this place from June till September, trying to\
  \ feel the cozy warmth of the evening hours, the square teeming with life. I see\
  \ elderly people with berets and fans sitting together in silence, occasionally\
  \ tapping the dried flagstones with their walking sticks. I see children jumping\
  \ around the kiosk with big, gleaming eyes, begging for the pink, sticky cotton\
  \ candy. I see lovers loving each other. And I mean \u2013 really loving each other.\
  \ Because it\u2019s summer and in summer, electricity fills the air, it spreads\
  \ in lightning speed, it creates the most unexpected constellations.\n\nThis place\
  \ must be leading a double life, I think. Like so many other places in winter. \n\
  \nIn December, nothing reminds of salted sunflower seeds, bare shoulders, colliding\
  \ beer bottles. It rather reminds of a ghost town. Rain is pouring in an endless\
  \ loop, greywashing the buildings, the water, the sky. The beach, in low tide formed\
  \ by four coastal stretches, is now just a small section of sand, touched by the\
  \ footprints of two single strollers braving the weather, soaked with humidity,\
  \ like my socks.\n\nWaves are smashing on the rocks of Isla de San Nicol\xE1s, again\
  \ and again. The sound makes me shiver. It echoes with the wet facades and lowered\
  \ blinds, the dull-green hills and thick clouds surrounding the sleepy town. The\
  \ seagulls shriek. The wind rages. The church bell behind me strikes twelve. That\u2019\
  s the soundtrack of my life, 16 years later.\n\nIt\u2019s lonely, and this kind\
  \ of loneliness is uncomfortable. It seeps into your skin; it bites into your bones.\
  \ Have I imagined it like this? Have I ever really had a picture of a beach in winter,\
  \ without crowds of people, loud voices and the smell of sun cream? Has there ever\
  \ been a different sea for me?\n\n\u201CExactly, this is soooo depressing.\u201D\
  \ \n\nShe is standing next to me now. She watches the rocking boats and drifting\
  \ sea gulls, still shaking her head in disbelief, embracing her tanned, warm skin\
  \ to keep away the cold.  \n\nIn this moment, seeing her and seeing me, I feel a\
  \ different kind of nudity, and that\u2019s when I understand. \n\nThe sea in winter\
  \ changes us. \n\nIt uncovers more than just skin, birthmarks, scars. It forces\
  \ you to let go of your own superficiality, to be still and receptive. It might\
  \ even bring you to your knees because there is nothing you can really cling to,\
  \ no stupid occupations, distractions, excuses. Here and now, life reduces itself\
  \ to the essential \u2013 and this can be very alarming. Because, who are you when\
  \ there is nobody else around? When all you see is waves rolling in and out on the\
  \ beach, and grey clouds spraying drizzle into your face, and an infinite, almost\
  \ overwhelming amount of space? Who are you, when you\u2019re lonely?\n\nI want\
  \ to tell her all of this. To this 14-year-old whom I\u2019m worlds apart from,\
  \ separated by losses and mistakes, travels and new beginnings. By this small Basque\
  \ fishing village in winter.\n\nInstead, with a heart beating fast with excitement,\
  \ I smile. \u201CSomeday, you\u2019ll understand.\u201D"
