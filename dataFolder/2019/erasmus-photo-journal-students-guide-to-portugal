Text: I went to Portugal as a student to do my work practice as a photographer. There,
  I have found myself in a situation of not being able to comunicate properly. English
  language was not very well known among the people I have been assigned to work with.
  So, I had to be creative and start learning the portuguese language by myself which
  I ended up learning pretty fast and as I learned the language, I felt like the whole
  new world opened up for me. I have travelled around Portugal (but not even close
  enough to see everything), I have met met a whole bunch of new people, I have been
  communicating in portuguese language on a daily basis and frankly, going to Portugal
  (and not knowing anything about culture or language or food or public ptransport)
  was the best experience in my life so far. When I returned (after a year living
  in Barcelos) I have made a travel guide for my diploma, for all the students that
  were supposed to go to Portugal to work or study. I wanted to share my experience
  and I wanted to help anyone who would find themselves in the same situation as I
  did. Travel guide contains descriptions of the city I have lived in, region Minho
  and some of the bigger cities in it, how to reach certain destinations, how to travel
  around the country, a lot about the food, life, traditions and there is a whole
  chapter about the capital city - Lisbon (my favourite city in the world). Also,
  I have decorated the guide with my own photographs and a short dictionary to help
  with the basic comiunication. After spending a year in Portugal I fell inlove with
  it, with it's people and culture, their warmth and kindness, so I take any chance
  I get to return to my second home :)
