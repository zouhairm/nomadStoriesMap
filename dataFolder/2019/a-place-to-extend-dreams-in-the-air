Text: "We left Medell\xEDn early. After three long hours of uncovered road trip we\
  \ arrived to La Pe\xF1a, a vereda of Abejorral. I wore sweater and scarf because\
  \ I was expecting to arrive to a cold town, but It was so warm.  It was time to\
  \ walk in a narrow steep road, we needed to stop sometimes to take a breath.  When\
  \ I was feeling really tired I saw the mountains through the trees, the flowers\
  \ and put attention on the insects crossing the way, it was in that moment when\
  \ I remembered my Grandma telling me: -\u201DThere is no place like Abejorral\u201D\
  . There was a pink flower growing in the middle of the arid way, then the magic\
  \ began to appear. The green landscape was so beautiful, I felt as my trip was narrated\
  \ by my Grandma as one of her stories, those only happened in her great natal Abejorral.\
  \ We were arriving to the Cerro San Vicente (The Saint Vincent), an impressive rocky\
  \ mountain, then we found the possibility of arriving by canopy with a 400 m rope\
  \ but we decided to finish the route just walking.  Our friends were waiting for\
  \ us at El Refugio (The Refuge), a craft hut with tangerine trees, many flowers,\
  \ two rooms, a kitchen with ground floor and a deck, and there we celebrated my\
  \ birthday. An excited friend told us: - \u201CTake a rest and have lunch so we\
  \ can go to The House of the air.\n \nWe began to climb a lot of steep stairs and\
  \ the amazing House in the air appeared, a handmade construction on a rock. I enjoyed\
  \ the landscape as much as to forget I was crossing a suspension bridge alone over\
  \ more of  20 m of height  to arrive to The House in the air, a small, warm and\
  \ comfortable space to observe Cerro San Vicente (The Saint Vincent), and the greatest\
  \ mountain of Antioquia I had ever visited.\nThe adrenaline was upstairs ... crossing\
  \ the suspension bridge again in another craft hut with a yellow propeller; it was\
  \ between lemon green leaves and a bougainvillea plant.\n \nThe most amazing experience\
  \ started when the guide moved me over the rode with a harness, I shouted excited\
  \ and there he prepared my hammock quickly. I was on the hammock as navigating the\
  \ sky in a little ship and the most beautiful colors dyed the clouds and the mountains.\
  \ To see the birds flying so near got me fullness, I was happy hanged there, watching\
  \ the nature and its magnanimity. I had a great opportunity to meditate at that\
  \ height. Then, I felt my Grandma`s voice, still narrating my experience, telling\
  \ the part of that story where a blue hair girl  forgot  she was scared just feeling\
  \ her as a part of the landscape, enjoying to travel and discover the world and\
  \ its unique places.\n \nMy dream was reflected on that view and Nilton L\xF3pez\
  \ Mu\xF1oz, it\xB4s thrill seeker creator shows me through this experience to extend\
  \ my dream in the air just to make it real. I felt so peaceful and comfortable there;\
  \ I felt like overcoming my limits to get my dream of going on a sketch trip around\
  \ the world.\n \nThat was the reason why I said: - I can`t go back home without\
  \ drawing this amazing place on my trip sketchbook and the next day I did it with\
  \ an unique energy, with a different wish to complete my sketchbook with the color\
  \ of my dreams that are soon to be real.\n \nCan you imagine me trying to swing,\
  \ without achieving it, for 40 minutes from a height of 30m, a couple of months\
  \ before visiting the House in the air?\nLet every trip make a renovated version\
  \ of you."
