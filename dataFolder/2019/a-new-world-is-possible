Text: "The air was thick with fear and screams as tear gas canisters shot by police\
  \ shatter the usual calm of a neighborhood just off of Istanbul's historic Taksim\
  \ Square. Protesters and passersby scramble down the road, some taking refuge in\
  \ Cafe Kazanci. I frequented the cafe on my way to Turkish classes, and the owners--two\
  \ young brothers--recounted that scene from a year prior during the Gezi Park demonstrations.\
  \ It was an event that felt revolutionary for many Turks from all walks of life,\
  \ especially those who occupied a small park in the square for weeks and created\
  \ an organic social commune that resisted the authoritarian regime's plans to bulldoze\
  \ one of the last remaining public green spaces in the massive city. I was in Turkey\
  \ a year after the revolt, during commemorative demonstrations of those who died,\
  \ and tasted tear gas for the first time. I had never seen so many police in my\
  \ life as I watched them chase down protesters from the balcony of a bar. Officers\
  \ from the nearby regions were called in as reinforcements to quell any gatherings.\
  \ Istanbul is a city divided by the Bosphorus Strait, a narrow body of water that\
  \ also serves as the continental divide between Europe and Asia. The mayor prohibited\
  \ all private ferry companies from transporting residents from the Asian to European\
  \ side to cut off the ability to protest. \n\nI crossed the cerulean waterway on\
  \ a day so bright the surface seemed to shimmer gold from sunlight. I was meeting\
  \ a contact I had made, Selin Top, who participated in the revolutionary demonstrations\
  \ and would show me tangible consequences of the movement they engendered. I met\
  \ her in Kad\u0131k\xF6y, the bohemian district on the Asian side. Our first stop\
  \ was the Don Ki\u015Fot Sosyal Merkezi (Don Quixote Social Space), a house that\
  \ had long sat vacant and blighted and was squatted by community members who re-claimed\
  \ it as a social space. Although not functioning now, we went inside and she showed\
  \ me the remnants of the memories made here. It was a self-designed community center\
  \ open to all where residents and visitors would collaborate to establish a vibrant\
  \ community resource. Dinners were shared here, and music, laughter, films, workshops.\
  \ There were clothes left strewn around the upstairs room where a clothing swap\
  \ was held. On the roof were plots of land once serving as a community garden. It\
  \ has now been torn down by the municipality and replaced with something less radical.\n\
  \nWe also visited a cafe that had been opened in solidarity with the spirit of Gezi.\
  \ As you walk in, a large sign shows some ground rules for behavior: \"No homophobia,\
  \ no racism, no sexism. Pay what you can afford.\" Have you ever enjoyed a cafe\
  \ without needing any money? And I'm not just talking free samples. This venue was\
  \ an exercise in living without capitalism, or an alter-capitalism. Completely run\
  \ by volunteers, in lieu of paying for items, anyone could donate their time and\
  \ dedication to cook and prepare goodies. Collaboration and cooperation as currency.\
  \ Capitalism reinforces in us that if we do not pay for something or cannot afford\
  \ to then it is not for us. Yet, there are other ways to imagine exchange and commerce.\n\
  \nUpstairs, Selin reflected more on the ramifications of the largest demonstrations\
  \ in decades in Turkey and if there were lasting consequences or significance. The\
  \ authoritarian regime was not knocked from power. Social malaise and economic uncertainty\
  \ had not much improved since. Yet, the process of resistance and building a commune\
  \ with different groups of people--many whom had never met before--was something\
  \ new. Living, working, caring for others, cooking, dreaming, building, in this\
  \ space that popped up overnight, it reminded her and the participants of the power\
  \ of connectedness. Even if it didn't accomplish immediate goals, it demonstrated\
  \ and reinvigorated a common humanity and sense of purpose to a greater community.\
  \ \"We held our ground as a force to declare to our leaders that something must\
  \ change. We must be heard. It made us feel like a new world is possible.\""
