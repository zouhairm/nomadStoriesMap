Text: "I was about six weeks into my transformational adventure through Southeast\
  \ Asia, when my life was forever changed. \n\nI had been traveling alone. I was\
  \ mesmerized by the breathtakingly beautiful sunsets every evening. I was intentionally\
  \ trying and thoroughly enjoying all of the delicious food. The smells, the sounds,\
  \ and the energy were invigorating.\n\nMy adventures were abundant, with each of\
  \ them teaching me an incredible amount about myself and about the world.\n\nOne\
  \ evening, after having dinner on Thailand\u2019s Tonsai Beach with some amazing\
  \ people I met hiking earlier in the day, I ran wild through the jungle in Railay\
  \ Beach. \n\nIt was 11 o\u2019clock, and I only had the light from the flashlight\
  \ on my phone to get back to my hotel.\n\nI don't know if you have ever run through\
  \ the jungle in Thailand? But let\u2019s just say, I will never forget that experience\
  \ as long as I will live! The sounds and darkness will forever leave an imprint\
  \ on my mind.\n\nI experienced all of these magical moments, and still, nothing\
  \ had a greater impact and transformational effect on me as my magical night on\
  \ Gili Trawangan in Indonesia.\n\nNight had faded into dawn, and it was a few minutes\
  \ before two o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\nPrior to this, I had experienced no\
  \ trouble with sleep -- in fact, I was sleeping 10 hours a night! When I kept waking\
  \ up, I decided to walk outside. Under the full moon, on a perfect evening, there\
  \ I was -- standing, looking up at the moon, listening to the sound of the ocean,\
  \ and the smells of the flowers and trees all around me, when I asked God what he\
  \ wanted to show me.\n\nIn that moment, God said: \u201CYou see all of this beauty\
  \ all around you, that you have been giving gratitude for, and are in awe of? The\
  \ beautiful fish and coral you saw today snorkeling? I created YOU to be more beautiful\
  \ than all of this.\u201D \n\nIn that moment, something happened in my heart, soul,\
  \ and mind. I began to sob. The tears streamed down like a river. I had been praying\
  \ for God to show me my beauty. \n\nIf I had not faced my fear and jumped off that\
  \ boat into the water earlier in the day and gone snorkeling ... I wouldn\u2019\
  t have been able to fully grasp the impact of God\u2019s whisper to me.\n\nThat\
  \ day, I saw some of the most beautiful fish I never even knew existed!\n\nThose\
  \ fish left me in awe of their beauty -- and I was left with a thought: \u201CGod\
  \ created me to be more beautiful.\u201D\n\nIn that moment, the judgmental, critical\
  \ girl, who extreme dieted and worked out because she hated her body, had recognized\
  \ the truth of who she is! And she is beautiful!"
