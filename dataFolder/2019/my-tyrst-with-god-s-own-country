Text: "This was the time when my husband was deputed to Ernakulam, Kerala in India.\
  \ With my eternal love for temples, I set out to explore the city and its temples\
  \ and other places of consequence. From the place where we were put up, the transport\
  \ was a bus ,auto or the most common thing which people preferred, i.e. by walk.\
  \ Not knowing the timings for bus, I asked a few people how to go to the main road.\
  \ Most of them felt that a good walk is the best way. So I started to walk. Believe\
  \ me, the walk was very bad idea as the distance was 3km away. But I did make some\
  \ friends on the way as very soon people understood that I was not local. Since\
  \ I could speak Malayalam, people warmed up to me and gave me directions for various\
  \ places. The first walk introduced me to a popular juice shop, a vegetable vendor\
  \ who could speak multiple languages, a super market where you could get things\
  \ you least expected and a small food joint where I could get non local food \U0001F600\
  \ roti and curry. Being a vegan also did not help me much as my options were barely\
  \ 10%. However to the surprise of my husband, I managed to find a vegan restaurant\
  \ as well. My next few days went well with me able to catch the bus and being able\
  \ to explore the sea shore, the Jack fruit festival where the recipes were a gastronomical\
  \ delight and a beniale which is a first time experience for me. But I would like\
  \ to recommend non vegetarians to visit a few places near to the beach and local\
  \ street vendors who keep their premises very neat and clean and serve amazing dishes\
  \ with pork and beef (courtesy my husband). Since the place is near to fort Cochin,\
  \ tourism thrives here. There are some amazing hotels to stay and now a days people\
  \ speaking all languages work at the places. \nComing to my temple sojourn, Ernakulam\
  \ is surrounded by temples at very considerable distances. There is the ernakulattapan\
  \ temples in the midst of the city. 9 kilometres from the city you have poornatrayas\
  \ temple dedicated to lord Krishna. 6kilometers from the Krishna temple, you have\
  \ Chottanikkara Bhagavathi temple which worships goddess Durga. Then 3kilometers\
  \ from this temple you have the lesser known Ameda temple dedicated to the Seven\
  \ mother's of the serpent God. \n60kilometers from here you visit Thrissur which\
  \ is famous for its pooram festival and also is place to Vadakkunathan temple of\
  \ lord Shiva . 30 kilometers from Thrissur we go to Guruvayur Krishna temple and\
  \ mammayoor Shiva temple. \nOn the way back, we also visited Kodungallur Devi temple\
  \ . After all the temple visits, my husband and daughter very visibly upset with\
  \ me, I could guess. So the next week,I planned to visit Kumarakom backwaters for\
  \ a boathouse experience. Trust me it was a surreal experience for me as it was\
  \ the first time I was amidst water and the serenity and calmness it brought to\
  \ my mind is something one has to experience. You can book online for this trip\
  \ and there are many operators giving you various options. You can opt for family\
  \ package, couple, single day, overnight stay. All comes with a price. The food\
  \ was good and services more than reasonable. If you make friends with the cook,\
  \ special vegan meals for you. \nOne thing I would like to mention is that, if you\
  \ want to enjoy, you need to let go of your rigidness and accept the cultural differences\
  \ that it comes with. A little bit of appreciation and openness will give you a\
  \ lot of Joy and memories to last. \nWhenever you visit Kerala, make a few adjustments\
  \ with food as it is prepared with coconut oil and no bargaining is encouraged.\
  \ Buy some souvenirs like the Nettipattam which is adorned on an elephant considered\
  \ as a symbol of prestige, Uruli,a brass vessel. A para which is a measuring vessel\
  \ for grains again considered auspicious, a wooden boat, a Kathakali face, Tooku\
  \ villakku, a hanging brass lamp and last but not the least a Kerala kasavu or cotton\
  \ wrap around."
