Text: "Burgos might not sound like a familiar name or figure in the lists of the top\
  \ destinations of the places one must visit. Yet, this most unassuming city is,\
  \ by all means, a must visit. It is absolutely charming and the river Arlanz\xF3\
  n dividing the city into the old and the new, and making it one of the most captivating\
  \ cities you can visit. \n\nIn the old part of town, you can admire the fine architecture\
  \ of pristine-kept, regal, medieval buildings mixed in with more contemporary ones\
  \ that blend seamlessly, like the Arc of Santa Mar\xEDa. The small, narrow and almost\
  \ labyrinth-like, streets shelter old world restaurants, quaint cafes, bookstores,\
  \ clothing stores, etc., all enclosed within medieval walls that hold the old part\
  \ of town together and keep it pedestrian friendly. Further, the must visit site,\
  \ has to be UNESCO's World Heritage Site winner, the Cathedral and Basilica of Santa\
  \ Mar\xEDa de Burgos which stands in the center of it all, as a grand masterpiece\
  \ and a magnificent example of gothic architecture and adorned with baroque and\
  \ renaissance accents. Do stop and take a closer look at the many carvings and sculptures\
  \ around the cathedral like the Door of the Apostles where you can single out each\
  \ one of the twelve apostles or why not marble at the regal beauty of the crown-like,\
  \ \"cimborrio\", octogonal tower. There is much to see here, so take your time.\
  \ \n\nHowever, the prominent cathedral is not the only church in town, there are\
  \ plenty more, and although all are less extravagant in d\xE9cor and much smaller\
  \ in size, they too are uniquely beautiful and worth the visit, such as one of my\
  \ favorites, the church of Saint Esteban of Burgos which showcases a thorough collection\
  \ of religious paintings and artifacts.  \n\nFurther uphill, towards a verdant forest,\
  \ you will find several paths that lead to the summit where the remains of the medieval\
  \ castle of Burgos stand, an area that now houses a small museum of its history\
  \ and serves as an ideal lookout point to take in the most spectacular views of\
  \ the city. \n\nWhen choose to cross the river into the new part of town, you must\
  \ visit the Museum of Human Evolution that will blow your mind away bringing you\
  \ closer to the past and the first peoples that roamed the face of the earth. Few\
  \ are aware that Burgos is one of the few places on earth where the accounts that\
  \ we know today of prehistoric, stone age peoples, first started. Here, you can\
  \ marble at the replicas of stone age drawings collected from caves nearby or stare\
  \ into the lifeless gazes of life-size replicas of our stone age ancestors, which\
  \ tell the evolutionary tale from early humans to more modern ones. You can even\
  \ their actual bones and learn how they lived their lives. And, lastly but just\
  \ as interesting, is the Charles Darwin exhibit, that explains in detail the travels\
  \ and discoveries of this genius scientist. In sum, the museum offers an engaging\
  \ and didactic experience for all and it is my favorite science museum in all of\
  \ Spain.\n\nHowever, if museums are not you thing and you rather go off the beaten\
  \ path but still learn something on the way, why not head over to the Atapuerca\
  \ working archeological site, where you can see the remains of several early human\
  \ specimens found there. Nothing beats being at the actual place where it all started\
  \ for us all.\n\nAnd, do take a walk along the many parks along the river Arlanz\xF3\
  n, some of which showcase recovered roman era remains and others, modern sculptures\
  \ from local artists that remind us that this is a modern city that has managed\
  \ to cleverly preserve its past with its present, and have that legacy be part of\
  \ its leisurely options. (Something to think about while you unwind and take a breather\
  \ from life). \n\nAll in all, if you are looking to take in Spain and Europe without\
  \ the commotion of huge crowds and packed touristy spots, this is the city for you.\
  \ Simply leave the luggage of preoccupations at the hotel and wander off into a\
  \ city that will surely leave you inspired."
