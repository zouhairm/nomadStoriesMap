Text: "One flat tyre would be considered unlucky. Two - an inconvenience. But four?\
  \ That had to be some sort of Afro-Cuban magic. \nBy the time I realised it was\
  \ about to happen again, it was too late. The crunch of the gravel under the tyre,\
  \ followed by an audible pop, and tyre number three was gone. \nWe were stranded\
  \ next to the rusted red auto relic, on a bare stretch of road, in rural Cuba.\n\
  Two Australians, two Argentinians and a Colombian. We stood around our driver as\
  \ he knelt next to the problem wheel. \nThe travel to the crystalline waters known\
  \ as Cayo Jutias had been much simpler. A smooth ride, no, but after the 1.5 hour\
  \ journey in the Cuban shared taxi known as a 'colectivo', we had arrived. \nThe\
  \ roads to Cayo Jutias had been a minefield of potholes, which our driver had deftly\
  \ navigated around to ensure no damage to the car. In hindsight, it would have made\
  \ no difference if he had sped through them, the ageing car proved incapable of\
  \ carrying the weight of six people.\nThere was no town in sight. The last village,\
  \ a small row of dotted houses with roosters tied by the foot to a stake in the\
  \ ground, told me this was an area more likely to be connected by cock fighting\
  \ than cell phone service.\nThe skies were beginning to swell with pink and orange\
  \ stripes at the corners - ordinarily, a beautiful site, but to me, a signifier\
  \ that we were going to be stuck, in the dark, on a side of a road in Cuba. \n\u201C\
  Well, I guess we\u2019re here for a while.\u201D The Colombian turned to address\
  \ us for the first time in English. Until then, all conversations had been in Spanish,\
  \ the shared tongue of the driver and other four passengers. \nI offered him a smile\
  \ while my face looked puzzled, the incongruence of his fluent Spanish jarring with\
  \ the thick North American accent when he spoke English.\n\u201CYour accent doesn\u2019\
  t sound Spanish \u2013 where do you live?\u201D\nHe was a Colombian, living in Canada,\
  \ working on the oil rigs for the past two decades. Every year, in the depths of\
  \ the ever-stretching Canadian winter, he made a trip to Cuba for two months \u2013\
  \ the allure of the sun, and a place where he could speak his native language, too\
  \ strong to resist.\nSensing we had not been following any of the conversations\
  \ in Spanish so far, the Colombian waved over the Argentinians. There, on the side\
  \ of the road, he sat and translated introductions and travel plans between the\
  \ five of us; the best place to get a Canchanchara cocktail in Vi\xF1ales; and where\
  \ to  dance salsa after dark in the main town.\nThere we were, three groups of strangers,\
  \ trading travel stories through an impromptu translator, as we sat on the side\
  \ of the dusty road. \nAfter some time, our driver came and crouched next to us,\
  \ the circle widening to welcome him in. It was only then that I noticed the sky\
  \ was now stretched in shades of deep blue, night well and truly upon us now.\n\
  The wheel couldn\u2019t be salvaged. We would have to wait until another car came\
  \ past.\n\u201CBut how would they have a spare tyre for us,\u201D I asked the Colombian,\
  \ puzzled.\nHe shared a look with the Cuban driver, and with a short exchange, the\
  \ driver shrugged his shoulders and smiled.\n\u201CIt\u2019s Cuba. We help each\
  \ other out,\u201D came the translated reply.\nSure enough, the next car that came\
  \ by some time later slowed to a stop next to us. Our Cuban driver spoke with his\
  \ counterpart, and before long, the boot of the other car was opening. A tyre was\
  \ being exchanged. Our car was back to four functioning wheels.\nAs we started off\
  \ in the car, I caught the face of the driver in the rear-view mirror. Tired, yes.\
  \ But his face was awash with contentment.\nI\u2019d never stopped to think about\
  \ the cost of getting to the beach before, until I saw his face that day. For this\
  \ Cuban, the equation was simple: two Australians. Two Argentinians. A Colombian.\
  \ And four tyres."
