Text: "It looked more like a schoolyard than an international border. Children of\
  \ all ages, in their clean crisp school uniforms lined up waiting for their turn\
  \ to enter Belize. The morning air was cooler than usual and I was lamenting my\
  \ self for not bringing a warmer jacket, but then the day was supposed to get warmer\
  \ later, giving me a sense of relief. After crossing the Belizean border into Guatemala\
  \ I made my way down into a small kiosk where I would get my passport stamped and\
  \ ask what bus would take me to El Remate. Turns out the stop was a 10-minute walk\
  \ away and from there it would be a 20-minute ride into town. On that bus, I was\
  \ fortunate enough to sit next to a very pleasant and eye-opening older woman who\
  \ would help me more than I could have ever expected. She told me of the places\
  \ in town to eat and how to get from place to place and about the various techniques\
  \ I needed to employ as I needed to take further precautions as I was a solo female\
  \ traveler. I didn't tell her about how of an inexperienced traveler I was and how\
  \ this was my second trip abroad on my own. She probably saw my uncertainty and\
  \ fright all over my face. I also came to find out that one of those many school\
  \ children was one of her grandson, who wakes up every morning at 6am to get ready\
  \ for school and have enough time to cross into Belize where he attends school.\
  \ She explained to me how even though there are schools in their town they are not\
  \ funded adequately and that the teachers lack proper training as they live in the\
  \ most rural part of Guatemala. Another positive was that the schools in Belize\
  \ are taught in English, which in turn would help her grandson get a much better\
  \ job and this was why she didn't mind the extra effort it took to get him there.\
  \ As I thanked her and promised that I would follow all her guidance, we parted\
  \ ways and on I went to find my accommodation and to see if I could book a tour\
  \ for the next morning to visit the ruins of Tikal. Although the town was more a\
  \ pass over for most tourist, I found that the people were the best part. I booked\
  \ my tour to Tikal without any difficulty and my Guide for the day was not much\
  \ older than me. Gustavo was full of knowledge and best of all proud to share it.\
  \ I learned so much but unlike other guides I\u2019ve had, he always found a way\
  \ tie everything back to the present day and to reflect how the natives of Tikal\
  \ did not disappear but are living today differently than the past but still held\
  \ on to traditions and a continuance relationship with the past and a struggle in\
  \ the present. Which coincidentally led back to my past as he told me how grateful\
  \ he was to have the opportunity to make a living from an honest job that allows\
  \ him to provide for his family and how it was difficult as he had to go to school\
  \ in Belize as he could learn English and how his family originally wanted him to\
  \ migrate to the states when he was older. Suddenly I saw Do\xF1a Maria\u2019s grandson\
  \ in the future and I couldn't help but have this moment of absolute happiness because\
  \ her effort did pay off. I came to Guatemala for only two days to see the Tikal\
  \ ruins which have been in my bucket list since I saw Star Wars as a kid. However,\
  \ I stayed much longer as I had fallen in love with the heart of the people I came\
  \ in contact with. Their difficulties and their strength to face hardship strait\
  \ on gave me courage and compassion. I left with more than some epic pictures of\
  \ ruins for my Instagram, I left with a feeling of empowerment and gratitude to\
  \ all the people I met, that have unknowingly taught me far more than school ever\
  \ could."
