Text: "IN A WAY, WE, BRAZILIAN YOUNG PEOPLE, ARE BEHIND ANYTHING THAT MAKES US GROW\
  \ AS HUMAN BEINGS AND THAT MAKES OUR HUMAN SIDE TO GROW UP. WE ARE IN SEARCH OF\
  \ KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCES THAT HELP US TO BE GREAT PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE.\nTHE\
  \ ISSUE I CHOOSE FITS VERY WELL WITH THE EXPERIENCE I WENT ON MY FIRST TRIP TO URUGUAY\
  \ / ARGENTINA, MORE EXPECIFIC THE COLONY OF THE SACRAMENT. EVERYTHING BEGINS WHEN\
  \ I RECEIVE AN INVITATION FROM MY GIRLFRIEND, TODAY MY EX-GIRLFRIEND, TO GO TO TRAVEL\
  \ TO URUGUAY AND ARGENTINA DURING JULY'S HOLIDAY WITH HER AND HER PARENTS. I WAS\
  \ ALREADY ON HOLIDAYS ONLY WAITING FOR THE DAY TO GO TRAVELING, WHEN IN THE WEEK\
  \ BEFORE WE LEAVE, I START FEELING A LOT OF PAIN IN THE REGION OF THE ABDOMEN, I\
  \ GO TO THE DOCTOR AND I DISCOVER THAT IT IS ACUTE APPENDICITE AND THAT I WOULD\
  \ HAVE TO BE URGENTLY OPERATED. BEFORE EVERYTHING THAT I HAD ALREADY THOUGHT THAT\
  \ THE TRIP WAS FINISHED FOR ME AND THAT I COULD NOT GO, BUT COVERSING WITH THE DOCTORS\
  \ I ENCOURAGED THEM TO LET ME GO, FOR THEY STILL RESTAURED 5 DAYS AND I WOULD GO\
  \ WELL AT THE TRIP DAY.\nWE WERE BY CAR, ON A MONDAY MORNING, FROM PORTO ALEGRE\
  \ TO COLONI OF THE SACRAMENT, WE ARRIVE AT NIGHT IN OUR DESTINY AND WERE DIRECT\
  \ TO SLEEP. THE NEXT MORNING WE TAKE COFFEE AND LEAVE TO VISIT COLONY, ON THE EXIT\
  \ OF THE APARTMENT I\u2019M IN LOVE WITH THE CITY, WE HAD A BEAUTIFUL VIEW TO THE\
  \ RIVER OF THE SILVER, THE AIR OF THAT CITY WAS PURE, THE WIND WAS QUIET, THE SUN\
  \ WAS COZY, THE PEOPLE VERY GENTIS, A FANTASTIC CITY.\nSO WE STARTED TO WALK TOWARD\
  \ THE HISTORICAL CENTER, I STARTED FEELING A DIFFERENT ASTRAL. EVERY STEP THAT I\
  \ GAVE WAS MOST ANSIOUS. A CITY OF INTERIOR, STOPPED, SMALL, BUT WITH HER CHARM\
  \ AND THAT ATTRACTED MANY PEOPLE TO VISIT HER AND NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY. ARRIVING\
  \ IN THE HISTORICAL CENTER I WAS BUMPER STICKED WITH THE BUILDINGS, WITH THE PLACE,\
  \ WITH THE PEOPLE, WITH ALL THAT I WAS LA, SIMPLY I FEELED A CHILD IN DIRECTION\
  \ TO THE UNKNOWN. EACH DETAIL OF THE ANCIENT CONSTRUCTIONS, THE WAY AS THE PEOPLE\
  \ CARE OF THE PLACE, HOW TO PRESERVE THEIR HISTORY IS SIMPLY FASCINATING.\nI KNEW\
  \ THE CITY ALL ABOUT AND I BELIEVE IT TODAY I DO NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. EVERY PLACE\
  \ WHICH WE VISITED HAD BEEN IN HIS BEAUTY, HAD HIS STORY, HAD ITS SECRETS, IT APPEARED\
  \ THAT I WAS IN A DREAM. THAT CITY HAS NOTHING TO SEE WITH A BIG CITY. YOUR CHARM\
  \ IS IN ITS OLD BUILDINGS, SMALL, WELL PRESERVED AND IN RESPECT OF PEOPLE WITH THE\
  \ PLACE. A CITY WHO COULD SHOW YOUR BEAUTY IN THE SIMPLE THINGS LIKE, GOLF FACILITIES\
  \ TO RENT FROM CITY CARS, TRANSFORM A HISTORICAL CENTER OF SOMETHING OLD TO SOME\
  \ WELL BE CAREFUL, MAINTAINED YOUR PROPERTY STYLE AND THE CONSTRUCTIONS, EVERYTHING\
  \ IS TO BE AFFORDABLE. EVERY MINUTE I WAS THERE WAS THE BEST POSSIBLE, IT WAS THERE\
  \ WHEN I DISCOVERED MYSELF AS A PERSON AND WHERE I HAD SURE THAT ARCHITECTURE IS\
  \ THE RIGHT PROFESSION FOR ME. I LEARNED VERY IN COLONY, OVER COLONY AND WITH COLONY,\
  \ I LEARNED TO BE A BETTER PERSON, ALWAYS SEEK MORE KNOWLEDGE AND STUDY ABOUT THE\
  \ PLACE I AM VISITING. WHAT I DISCOVERED ON THIS TRIP WAS HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU KNOW\
  \ SOMETHING ELSE YOU DON\u2019T KNOW.\nNO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW, SO WHEN\
  \ GIVING A JUMP TO THE UNKNOWN WILL KNOW TRULY. COLONY WILL ALWAYS BE WITH ME AND\
  \ WANTING TO TRAVEL TO OTHER PLACES UNKNOWN FOR ME AND I HOPE TO HAVE EQUAL AND\
  \ NEW EMOTIONS THAT I HAD."
