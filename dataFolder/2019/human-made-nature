Text: "Journey is the spice of life.It makes us feel alive and worth living for.Travelling\
  \ to the places we love, not only gives us immense pleasure,but it also calms our\
  \ mind,soothes our soul and enriches our inner self.Every travelling story comes\
  \ up with innumerable memories,experiences(both good and bad),and yes, lots of fun.Travelling\
  \ is learning, the form of learning where no one gets bored. Sometimes, a journey\
  \ becomes so memorable because it was unexpectedly amazing. Its like you shoot for\
  \ the star but end up having the Moon itself on your lap.I was lucky enough to have\
  \ such 'Moon falling on my lap\" experience, when I visited Dubai. \n          The\
  \ time I landed to the land of prolific as well as lavish buildings and people,\
  \ my heart started dancing to the brim with joy. My happiness knew no boundaries.\n\
  The first day started with the sight of alluring beauty of the artificially created\
  \ yet stunning grasslands by the side of the roads,and the tall structures of various\
  \ brands and MNCs unknown to me till then.The evening became mesmerising admist\
  \ the Cruise in the heart of the Dubai Creek,earlier known as River Zara,where I\
  \ enjoyed Tanoura Dance. Its thrilling to witness the caliber of the dancer to look\
  \ admirable and perform the dance enchantingly in rotating motion for over 5-7 mins\
  \ continuously, both at the same time.Being an Indian, I couldn't hold the enthusiasm\
  \ of interacting with one of the waiter who was also an Indian,and was working there\
  \ for around 5 years ,and totally accustomed to the Tanoura Dance. From him, I came\
  \ to know that it's a form of Egyptian folk dance, developed partly from Sufi dance\
  \ in Turkey. \nWhole night, when the entire Dubai indulged itself into a deep slumber,\
  \ I kept on summoning the entire events,and slowly my retina signalled my Central\
  \ Nervous system in the brain to induce some slumber upon me, thus I fell asleep\
  \ by dawn.\nAgain, unexpectedly,the next day was full of surprises as well. It was\
  \ now time for Dubai tour- the smartest way to learn the culture and tradition of\
  \ Arab, as well as it's significance. Our guide Mr.Naseer tactfully managed to catch\
  \ our attention and narrated the story of the struggle of the people of old Dubai,\
  \ who , with the help of their tremendous level of hard-work and unending passion,\
  \ not only transformed a barren land into one of the richest places in the World\
  \ but also,with their unique survival strategies created an artificial forest in\
  \ a desert.\nVisiting Dubai Museum helped me a lot in studying their transformation\
  \ from rags to riches. And now, it was time for some \"beach fun\" and photoshoots.\
  \ I thoroughly enjoyed the beach session that refreshed and quenched my thirsty\
  \ soul. \n       By interacting with the Taxi drivers, I came to know that Dubai\
  \ is highly cosmopolitan in distribution and welcome people from all Nationalities\
  \ with a broad heart. The  taxi driver on my way to the Dubai Mall already gave\
  \ me a hint of the beauty and serenity of the mega building and the moment I entered\
  \ the mall, the kid inside me wanted to jump and hover out of joy, as it is a hub\
  \ to almost all the brands present on earth,and where one can find anything and\
  \ everything.\nThe water park came as a surprise and was a healthy treat to my eyes.\
  \ Being a Zoologist, it was really unbelievable to find an entire collection of\
  \ fauna, starting from Sea horse to a  wide variety of fishes. Penguins, all the\
  \ way from Antarctica, interacting and entertaining the visitors in a country where\
  \ the temperature generally ranges from 35-49 degree Celsius-it can happen only\
  \ in Dubai.\n   Last but not the least, my travel story coming to an end with the\
  \ beauty BURJ KHALIFA,that took 5 years to be constructed,with a total height of\
  \ 829m(2,722 ft), it is worth mentioning that it has the fastest lift in the world.\
  \ It was a dream come true moment for me when I entered BURJ KHALIFA and couldn't\
  \ consider myslf more luckier. \n    The entire journey has been very inspiring\
  \ and delivered ample of reasons to travel back to Dubai again and again ."
