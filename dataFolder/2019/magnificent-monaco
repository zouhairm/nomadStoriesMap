Text: "My first visit to Europe included a day-trip to Monaco, a breathtaking city-state\
  \ tucked along the French Riviera, between France and the meticulous Mediterranean\
  \ Sea.  With fairy tale-like surroundings, its surreal history and jaw dropping\
  \ beauty, Monaco will leave you dreaming and in love.  The water of the Mediterranean\
  \ is the bluest of blues, giving you a welcome embrace of sunshine and cheer.  Upon\
  \ arrival, if you don\u2019t feel like you were dropped by stork in the middle of\
  \ an enchanted paradise, you soon will.  Embellished with memories and love for\
  \ the elegant American actress Grace Kelly and her husband Prince Rainier III, the\
  \ former Prince of Monaco, who were married in 1956 at the St. Nicholas Cathedral\
  \ at which time the beautiful actress became the Princess of Monaco.  The St. Nicholas\
  \ Cathedral, build in 1875, is at the center of cultural life of Monaco, the setting\
  \ for many national events and a must-see on any itinerary to this little slice\
  \ of heaven. \n\nSeemingly located on a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean, providing\
  \ a birds-eye view of mountains from afar, boats of many shapes and sizes bobbing\
  \ along the bay, and the greenest of green landscapes, Monaco is absolutely one\
  \ of the most beautiful places on our loving earth; being there can seem like a\
  \ leap into the unknown and very surreal at times.  Even if you only have a few\
  \ hours to spend, be sure and capture the Changing of the Guards at the Prince's\
  \ Palace, the official residence of Albert II, Prince of Monaco, son and successor\
  \ of Prince Rainier III and Princess Grace.  Afterwards, enjoy lunch at one of many\
  \ local caf\xE9s and pick up a remarkable souvenir from La Condamine Markets. \n\
  \nDid you know the Formula 1 Monaco Grand Prix is considered one of the most prestigious\
  \ races in the world, where Formula 1 race cars whiz through the streets of Monaco?\
  \  This event takes place each year in May and has not changed much since its inception\
  \ in 1955.  Even if you are not visiting during race time, you can check out the\
  \ starting line, where the race begins, and after visiting Monaco in its entirety,\
  \ you will truly understand its prestige.  Speaking of cars, while in Monte Carlo\
  \ you are likely to see exotic automobiles of varying makes, models, styles and\
  \ colors dashing through town, at almost any turn, ensuring a neck massage will\
  \ be needed at the end of your visit.\n\nIn the event you are considering purchasing\
  \ a small vacation home or relocating to this stunning country, you can own a remarkable\
  \ studio flat in Monte Carlo with a whole 46 square meters of living space for a\
  \ cool 1.43 million Euros.  In American measurements and dollars that is approximately\
  \ 495 square feet for 1.6 million US Dollars, respectively; just a nice little weekend\
  \ getaway, no problem.  One final thought for those like myself who sometimes fret\
  \ over a language barrier.  Although French is the official language of Monaco,\
  \ everyone you are likely to encounter probably speaks English; if you took three\
  \ years of the enchanting French language in high school (20 years ago), you undoubtedly\
  \ remember how to ask, \"Do you speak English?\" in French.\n\nBonjour!"
