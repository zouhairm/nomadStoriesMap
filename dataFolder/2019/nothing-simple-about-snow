Text: "Part One: Endurance\n\nMy internal clock floated between consciousness and\
  \ dreaming.  I finally woke up, only to realise, the Uber driver was arriving in\
  \ 7 minutes.  The clock was ticking for a reservation to Tullamarine Airport at\
  \ 4:40 am. Mind racing. I scrambled for the prepacked belongings without forgetting\
  \ the Sony Alpha 7sII. Dashing from level 13 to ground floor was a battle within\
  \ minutes to spare.\n\nHonestly, the whole morning was a blur. All I could recall\
  \ was the beaming rays of sunlight, waves of fluffy clouds and the shadow between\
  \ the contours of the cumulus clouds. Hard to think if it was a nightmare or a dream,\
  \ I collected my international luggage in Sydney and eased into transit for Norway.\
  \ I can\u2019t say 15, 089km in 27 hours is a physical endurance exercise. Though,\
  \ more definitely a psychological sport travelling across a distance equating to\
  \ 9.3km/minutes sleep deprived! \n\nGreetings from Oslo International Airport validated\
  \ my internal madness.\n\n\u201CHow long will you be staying here for?\u201D Inquired\
  \ the Customs Officer.\n\n\u201C10 days.\u201D I responded. \n\n\n\u201CWill you\
  \ be travelling elsewhere. Europe?\u201D  He quizzed. \n\n\u201CNo.\u201D I said.\
  \ After 23 hours my head was pounding. I felt the rush of blood thrusting against\
  \ the prefrontal cortex and temporal lobe. The region that governs thought process\
  \ and inhibition and the other is for auditory perception and speech. I completely\
  \ understated my capacity.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s quite the distance to come to Norway.\u201D\
  \ He stated rhetorically.\n\nI paused. \n\nThe rush of dopamine fought with a thought\
  \ as I answered, \u201CI wanted to see the Norwegian snow and maybe snowflakes\u201D\
  . Inhibition out the window as the inner child spoke. \n\nIf you have lived in Sydney,\
  \ a snowflake is more than ice crystals. The average 26.5 degree Celsius in January\
  \ would have evaporated snow, at most, into clouds. \n\nWith a smile, he joked,\
  \ \u201CTake all the snow you want. Welcome to Norway\u201D. \n\n\u201CTusen Takk.\u201D\
  \ I was surprised and smiled in return; for the first time, saying thank you in\
  \ Norwegian. \n\n\nPart Two: Enlightened\n\nUnder the Arctic sky, I felt the crispy\
  \ chilled air brushing against my cheeks, and you can\u2019t help but smell of smoky\
  \ birch wood burning nearby. In the dark, it was difficult to decipher the environment\
  \ until your eyes adjusted. Icicles formed on the edges of the timber cone-shape\
  \ roof and the woodfire murmured against the frosty glass window. You will only\
  \ find, if you were exploring, searching and looking. The magnetic dancing green\
  \ and blue light were all true stories that would bedazzle any night light hunters.\
  \ \n\nMy fingers were partially frozen beneath the breathless pulsing Aurora Borealis.\
  \ No attire would have prepared me for the wintry night falling below -14 degrees\
  \ Celsius. Not even my favourite purple The North Face tri-climate jacket with layers\
  \ of HeatTech thermals.  Inside a Sami Hut, I listened to the young Sami local describing\
  \ parallel responsibilities between education, being indigenous and reindeer herding.\
  \  I rediscovered the animal kingdom in a new light, hearing reindeers being attacked\
  \ by wolverines. The last time I came across wolverines was the film \u2018The Wolverine\u2019\
  \ starring Hugh Jackman! I was astounded learning their existence and jarred to\
  \ know the small look alike bear hunted reindeers for sports and leisure. Evolution\
  \ sure has digressed from Darwinism.\n\n\nPart Three: Gradient 5.5%\n\nMy scenic\
  \ rail journey from Bergen to Flam was showered by \u2018awed\u2019 moments.  The\
  \ most surprising was gazing out the window next to a stranger, observing snow composited\
  \ in layers; as it were to stop and continued periodically over the span of that\
  \ morning. It was like a glimpse of time \u2013 slowing down. At 866m above sea\
  \ level, a snowflake with all the edges shimmered and glided elegantly beside the\
  \ window.  Civil responsibilities, day job and who I was, completely forgotten.\
  \  \n\nPossibly, the elephant in the room is when you experience an unexpected human\
  \ connection during your travels. I didn\u2019t expect to find a stranger apologising\
  \ for our mutual connection and prompted, \u201CI\u2019m sure we will cross paths\
  \ again\u201D.  Finally, I understood and whispered \u201CFarvel\u201D in Norwegian\
  \ as we parted. In my last protest to our short time together, I raised the Sony\
  \ Alpha 7sII that brought us together into the air and smiled."
