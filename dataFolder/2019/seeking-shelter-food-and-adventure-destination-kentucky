Text: "Shelter, food and an adventure. Those were the only three considerations that\
  \ crossed my mind before booking a flight to Nashville for the folllowing day. \
  \ \n\nI was in San Diego. After several weeks travelling with an old friend in California\
  \ I was almost penniless with another eleven months left on my working holiday visa\
  \ in the US.  Dreams of \u2018working\u2019 in a hostel on the California coast\
  \ and partying the summer away had quickly evaporated with my lack of planning.\
  \ After a frantic night searching for a host on the wwoofing website I had a response.\
  \ I was off to Scottsdale, Kentucky. \n\nI was greeted by old pick up truck and\
  \ a farmer with a southern drawl. So far so good. We chugged and spluttered our\
  \ way north in the pitch darkness until the towns grew fewer and further between.\
  \  Finally, several hours later, we pulled into the house and I passed out. \n\n\
  There is something special about arriving at a new place at night. You are there,\
  \ but not really. It hasn\u2019t revealed itself to you yet and there\u2019s a magical\
  \ period where your expectations and the place itself live in perfect harmony. \
  \ A rare - albeit temporary - mystery in a world where curiosities can be satisfied\
  \ at the touch of a button.  \n\nThe first thing I recognise upon waking is the\
  \ baking of dogs. Lots of dogs. And nothing else. I recall the ad on the wwoofing\
  \ site mentioning something about training sheep dogs and slowly make my way downstairs\
  \ where I hear movement. The house is filled with light. Buckets of water are being\
  \ tipped into pans above gas burners.  As I greet the farmer I start to absorb more\
  \ of my surroundings. The kitchen consists of a bench and chilly bin (I later learn\
  \ \u2018cooler\u2019 in American parlance). There is no oven or fridge. As I turn\
  \ I see a lot of wood. A large fireplace. And a bookshelf with various instruments\
  \ dangling in front a several dusty volumes.  \n\nAfter breakfast and as we are\
  \ feeding the forty plus dogs it finally sinks in. I have moved to a remote farm\
  \ in rural Kentucky with no electricity or running water.  The nearest town is a\
  \ thirty minute drive away. Our neighbors are a Mennonite community (I make a mental\
  \ note to google what Mennonites later just as I realise this isn\u2019t possible).\
  \ I have no car, little money, and no way of contacting my family in New Zealand.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019d always considered myself fairly hardy and adaptable. I grew up on\
  \ a farm in rural New Zealand, I could cope with anything.  But no running water\
  \ and electricity? And, as I would later discover, no sugar? The distance between\
  \ my expectations of a lazy summer in rural (but connected) Kentucky and the present\
  \ reality was vast to say the least. How had I jumped into this situation so quickly\
  \ and blindly? \n\nSkip forward several days of hard (and I mean hard: trimming\
  \ sheep hooves, pulling out thistles, and treating pink eye in fairly wild cattle)\
  \ work, sugar withdrawals and homesickness, and I had found my rhythm.  Necessity\
  \ is the mother of all invention - and character building it would seem. I discovered\
  \ my love of sugar and baking overwhelmed my extremely overt politeness, and I was\
  \ soon cooking and baking for the crew on the condition that I chose what we ate.\
  \ \n\nWhen you\u2019re working outdoors you operate by the sun. Life is simple.\
  \ When the sun starts to sink and fireflies hover, it is time to sit back and reflect\
  \ on the days\u2019 work. There is really something to be said about physically\
  \ seeing what you have achieved for the day. \n\nThroughout my time in Kentucky\
  \ I learnt so much. The lack of distractions meant I embraced the opportunity to\
  \ learn some banjo. It turns out the farmer and his family were part of a travelling\
  \ band.  Aside from this and the myriad of new skills I picked up - including milking\
  \ a cow by hand - I most of all learnt that the best adventures are the unexpected\
  \ ones. Shelter and food are relative terms. Adventure is always to be had."
