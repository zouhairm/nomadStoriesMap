Text: "Moody weather has set in on this mid-summer afternoon in Cape Town. Winds lash\
  \ the harbour and push the tail of the storm to snake amongst the buildings, rattling\
  \ the windows and doors of this third cocktail bar, in which I find myself on a\
  \ quest to seek the finest gin bar in the city. A glow cast from brassy lamps softening\
  \ oak-panelled walls and brocade seating. The lungs of a lone saxophonist fil the\
  \ bar with jazzy 1950\u2019s tunes.\n\nAbandoning my disappointing cocktail, I choose\
  \ to brave the inclement weather rather than subject myself to another tipple of\
  \ mediocrity. Stepping onto the cobbled paving, I close the rickety-chic door of\
  \ the bar behind me and head down the street. A gusty wind tugs at my collar as\
  \ I blast past restaurants and artisan shops.\n\nDeep-rooted trees, with gnarled\
  \ branches whip me by, as the wind and I curl our way towards the trendy Heritage\
  \ Square at nightfall.  \n\nThe Cape Dutch building I enter dates to 1771. The vine\
  \ which is of the same year, I pass under, is the oldest fruit-bearing vine in South\
  \ Africa still producing wine. Hurricane lamps amongst lush foliage cast lazy shadows\
  \ on antiquated soaring rock walls, crafted by stonemasons. A carved fountain softens\
  \ the distant drum of the wind. I find my way towards the staircase that leads me\
  \ to the fourth destination on my quest. \n\nAscending the wooden staircase to the\
  \ strained notes of a distant lounge singer, an eclectic venue The Drinkery, awaits\
  \ me on the landing. The fine art and furniture in the main bar are presided over\
  \ by a petite, raven-haired owner, Shay Davis. French doors lead to the sprawling\
  \ balcony that overlooks the square. Pride of place in the bar, the forty hand-picked\
  \ gins in designer bottles. \n \nI head for a plush, deep-buttoned sofa in the main\
  \ bar. Shay gives me a short rundown of the history of the square and reveals that\
  \ her charming establishment occupies a previous slave lodge, built here after the\
  \ arrival of Dutch colonialists. She slips away, and a few minutes later returns\
  \ with my first cocktail. \n\nThe fragrant gin and pink tonic garnished with grapefruit\
  \ and pomegranate is a delight. As I savour the smooth experience on my palate,\
  \ something wedged between the brickwork draws my attention. Slightly obscured by\
  \ the soft lighting, but still present in the mason\u2019s mosaic. \n\nStretching\
  \ my arm, I reach the sliver protruding from the wall. It feels coarse to the touch\
  \ but with a craft like refinement. I am intrigued and rubbing the edge of what\
  \ turns out to be fabric, my index finger dislodges some threads.\n\nAn exclamation\
  \ of surprise from Shay startles me and I smirk apologetically. My bewildered expression\
  \ elicits a smile from her. Placing my second drink on the table, she enlightens\
  \ me to what the find may be. During its use as a slave lodge, captives would wedge\
  \ pieces of fabric from their clothing amongst the bricks, in the hope that a relative\
  \ who came after them would find it and recognise it. \n\nWe gently remove the small\
  \ piece of fabric, and although quite faded, the cloth is breath-taking. As it rests\
  \ in my palm, we observe the profound moment. Shay undertakes to add this treasure\
  \ to her Box of Hope. \n\nTime to try a 1528 Cocoa gin from Spain, served with tonic\
  \ and garnished with chocolate, cinnamon and strawberry. By now the cocktail singer\
  \ had left and was replaced by a jazzy string quartet\u2014my cue to move to the\
  \ balcony. \n\nLooking down into the square, I am greeted by the sight of diners\
  \ at candlelit tables. Around me, The Drinkery has filled up substantially and the\
  \ balcony is bustling with locals and visitors from abroad. Shay confidently switches\
  \ between French and Spanish as she moves amongst her patrons.\n\nI finish my last\
  \ cocktail and leave The Drinkery, feeling content that I have completed my quest\
  \ to find the best Gin Bar at the bottom end of Africa, while at the same time discovering\
  \ something unexpected. A faded piece of memory left by a lone slave girl."
