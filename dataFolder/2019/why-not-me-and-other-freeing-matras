Text: "As my bachelor\u2019s degree was coming to a close in early 2018, I was feeling\
  \ a little lost. Though I had ample work experience and did very well academically,\
  \ I often found myself envious of my peers who were able to drop everything in search\
  \ of \u201Clife experience\u201D.\nI watched friend after friend pack their bags,\
  \ board planes, and tell me their stories once I picked them up from the airport,\
  \ but I knew I shouldn\u2019t dream of such a luxury, as I was the only one supporting\
  \ myself financially through school. \u201CThat will never be me,\u201D I often\
  \ thought to myself after hearing all of their travel stories.\nWhen I graduated,\
  \ I decided to pursue my studies further by moving two provinces away from my maritime\
  \ home to attend the University of Ottawa. It was there that I happened to receive\
  \ an email gauging interest in a new international double masters program. While\
  \ looking at the email I was already jealous of the lucky students who would get\
  \ this opportunity.\nThen, I thought twice.\n\u201CWhy can\u2019t that be me?\u201D\
  \ I thought. And strangely, I couldn\u2019t think of any reason why not. I qualified\
  \ for the scholarships. I fit the criteria of the program. I\u2019d been diligently\
  \ saving for years in a \u201Cjust in case it\u2019s my turn\u201D kind of fund.\
  \ So, I emailed the coordinator.\nUpon receiving further information, I knew this\
  \ program would be challenging. It was expected for students in the program to be\
  \ fluently bilingual. While I had been in French Immersion in high school, I had\
  \ completely my undergraduate degree completely in English. Ordinarily, this would\
  \ have stopped me from pursuing the program further, but the same thought from before\
  \ said \u201Cwhy not me?\u201D. I jumped in head first at the University of Ottawa\
  \ in classes completely in French, and to my surprise (and with the help of encouraging\
  \ friends I met along the way) I passed!\nFast foreword to this semester, 2019.\
  \ I\u2019m studying in Belgium after boarding my first ever international flight.\
  \ \nIf you had asked me in February 2018 if I would be studying outside of Canada,\
  \ I would have given you a funny look. But a lot changes in a year: friends, schools,\
  \ addresses and attitudes. I no longer have to wonder what it would be like to live\
  \ out one of my friend\u2019s vacations, because after lots of determination, their\
  \ vacations are my life.\nAnd why not?"
