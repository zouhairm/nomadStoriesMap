Text: "Nabi Amaan\u2019s day starts before dawn. He wakes up to offer Fajr (Islamic\
  \ morning prayers), enjoys a simple breakfast \u2013 biscuits with tea on a regular\
  \ day and occasionally treats himself to a paratha dripping with generous amounts\
  \ of ghee, he then says goodbyes to his family and heads out to make a living while\
  \ braving the megacity\u2019s hot weather. After working tirelessly round the clock,\
  \ Nabi Amaan heads back home around midnight, watches his kids sleep peacefully\
  \ and eats dinner with his wife, only to continue with life the next day. This is\
  \ what the life of a coachman is in Pakistan\u2019s bustling city of Karachi.\n\
  Forty-eight-year-old Nabi Amaan hails from the Swabi district located in the Khyber\
  \ Pakhtunkhwa province of the country and drives a horse-drawn carriage \u2013 what\
  \ he refers to as Victoria \u2013 to make his ends meet. Having lived in Karachi\
  \ ever since his childhood, Nabi Amaan calls this jungle of concrete his home. He\
  \ was a teenager when he first took over the reins of his maternal uncle\u2019s\
  \ carriage, but he says it was \u201Cjust for fun\u201D. But little did he know\
  \ that he\u2019ll be driving the Victoria for the rest of his life.\n\u201CDuring\
  \ my teenage years, I was fascinated with the Victoria that my uncle drove around\
  \ Karachi. I would spend the whole day with him and his carriage,\u201D Nabi Amaan\
  \ responds when I ask how he grew fond of driving a carriage.\nFrom making turns\
  \ on streets to adjusting the horse\u2019s speed on the road and from the art of\
  \ communicating with the horse to perfectly training it \u2013 his uncle taught\
  \ him everything. The then young Nabi Amaan simultaneously did a few odd jobs and\
  \ learnt to drive a carriage. He started working as a proficient Victoria driver\
  \ in 1982 and never looked back again.\nIt was a scorching March morning in Karachi\u2019\
  s Frere Hall \u2013 a local park \u2013 where I meet Nabi Amaan, who speaks of the\
  \ past and how his life as a coachman changed in the traffic-ridden city. He laments\
  \ about the lack of interest among people for this royal-esque carriage. \u201C\
  During the 80s, Karachi was very peaceful. Both locals and foreigners used the Victoria\
  \ regularly. People from all over the world toured the city rather frequently and\
  \ enjoyed riding on horse-drawn carriages. There was no fear at all. But after the\
  \ deadly 9/11 attacks and the beginning of War on Terror, the law and order situation\
  \ of Pakistan worsened and foreigners stopped visiting, which eventually had an\
  \ adverse impact on our livelihood. Nothing remained the same,\u201D he says with\
  \ a visibly sad fa\xE7ade.\nTo worsen the situation, majority of Karachi\u2019s\
  \ residents now use cars, bikes, rickshaws, buses or app-based ride-hailing services\
  \ to commute; while foreigners only ever step out of their hotels if they are travelling\
  \ in their bullet-proof vehicles with beefed-up security around them.\nI hopped\
  \ on the carriage for a ride around town and talk to Nabi Amaan in the meantime.\
  \ How did you manage to earn a living in such difficult times, I enquire when told\
  \ about the declining number of passengers. \u201CWe started pick and drop service\
  \ for school-going children and worked round the clock to cater students of both,\
  \ morning and afternoon shifts,\u201D Nabi Amaan responds. But what he earns on\
  \ a monthly basis is meagre, even for a low-income household in Karachi.\nEvery\
  \ morning, the coachman arrives at one of the city\u2019s oldest horse-drawn carriage\
  \ stands in Saddar area and ends his day around 10 o\u2019clock at night. Nabi Amaan,\
  \ who is a father of four \u2013 three sons and one daughter, says that he would\
  \ never want his children to take over the carriage\u2019s reins from him. \u201C\
  I want them to be educated and share their knowledge with others, as it is the best\
  \ way to serve humanity and live a rewarding life,\u201D he says talking about his\
  \ children\u2019s future.\nNabi Amaan is the carrier of Queen Victoria\u2019s legacy\
  \ in Karachi and as much as Pakistanis despise the British for ruling over their\
  \ land, Victoria is a special part of their heritage, which requires immense attention\
  \ to help the city\u2019s culture thrive."
