Text: "I lodged in at a guest house in Kaloleni right after 10:25 PM when the last\
  \ bus from Dar es Salaam arrived in Arusha, well,  I could\u2019ve arrived at 7PM\
  \ if i had departed at 6AM but instead i departed three hours later.\n\nThe guy\
  \ who came to pick me up at the bus stand goes by the name Vicent, he is a chef\
  \ and a tour guide who speaks Swahili, English, Italian and several venacular languages,\
  \ quite something, right?\nVicent was recommended to me by a friend of mine who\
  \ is in Mto wa Mbu (117km) from Arusha.\n\nI am on my way to Mto wa Mbu but Arusha\
  \ is worth a stay because of its cool weather and the always beautiful view of the\
  \ black-blue Mount Meru.\n\nMeru is Africa\u2019s fifth highest mountain, they also\
  \ call it Mt. Kilimanjaro\u2019s sister and if you are not a local native it is\
  \ not bad to gaze at the beautiful volcanic rock at time intervals of your choice.\n\
  \nI went to bed thinking about filming the sunrise in the morning but the sun became\
  \ visible at 11AM and that is normal here, sometimes the sun comes at 3PM but the\
  \ sunset is spectacular here especially when you are at an elevated view point-\
  \ more like passion, orange and watermelon glasses of juice.\n\nWandering around\
  \ the city in the morning and I couldn\u2019t help but take so much of the blue\
  \ theme the city carries. Some would say it\u2019s purple but the jacaranda trees\
  \ are really giving the City the theme it deserves by decorating it with it\u2019\
  s blue flowers and a couple of places in the city have been names after the iconic\
  \ tree.\n\nIf you're driving towards the Arusha Declaration Monument round about\
  \ from any direction you will notice the landmark located at the centre of blue\
  \ flowers. The Arusha Declaration Monument is a landmark and tourist attraction\
  \ in which was unveiled in 1977 to commemorate ten years of Arusha Declaration-\
  \ a memorable event in the history of Tanzania.\n\nThe last time I was in Arusha\
  \ was 2004 and I never did much of moving around the city, I was staying at Usa\
  \ River\u2019s Danish Center where my cousin worked.\n\nThe whole feel here can\
  \ easily make you extend your stay as you may want to explore the city more with\
  \ hopes of finding a different hue of blue. \n\nI shall definitely visit Arusha\
  \ again for a longer stay as I was on my way to Unlock Mto wa Mbu, a town that is\
  \ two hours away. Till then."
