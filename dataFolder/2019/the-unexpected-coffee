Text: "Blond guys have always turned my head. That's a very peculiar fact about me:\
  \ all my life, since \"Golden \"Joshua - my first boyfriend back in high school,\
  \ I've only had eyes for the yellow head team. I remember the days back in Columbia\
  \ University in those super glamourous parties where I only had eyes for the blonde,\
  \ preppy guys and was the most popular girl at school - why does time go by so fast?\n\
  \nSo there I was in my mid-thirties, sitting at a very comfortable spot at Mantsy,\
  \ a busy local coffee house in Honolulu - in another one of the all-alone trips\
  \ I used to go on during my vacation - while listening to \"All By Myself\" by C\xE9\
  line Dion playing on my recently bought AirPods. I was searching online where I\
  \ wanted to go on my next trip when suddenly it came to my mind what my shrink had\
  \ told me the week before: maybe all the money I spent on all those travels was\
  \ due to the feeling I had that I was going to die alone with my seven cats. I don't\
  \ know exactly when I bought the idea, but maybe she was right - maybe the \"Hawaiian\
  \ Way of Life\" (sorry for the sarcasm) made me see another perspective: perhaps\
  \ all the happiness I was searching on Louboutin's and expensive destinations was\
  \ actually hidden in those colorful (yet so kitsch!) flip-flops and the sea.\n\n\
  As I was having these crazy thoughts, a black-haired guy got into the coffee shop.\
  \ He ordered a pink ice-creamy drink and wore a fuzzy bright blue jacket, green\
  \ gym shorts and the darn flip-flops. His arms were 100% covered by crazy tattoos\
  \ and he was so different I couldn't stop looking at him, which made him come right\
  \ into my direction. All the tables were taken, so he politely asked if he could\
  \ sit with me. I was honestly ashamed - can you imagine a high society businesswoman\
  \ in her Versace's sharing a table with a university student? Well, I couldn't -\
  \ until then.\n\nTwo hours have gone by and felt like five minutes. I was completely\
  \ astonished. Was it possible that a guy less half my age (is that right? I've never\
  \ been good with maths - oh, it doesn't matter) caught my attention more than any\
  \ super polished man I ever had the opportunity to go out with? Youssef was different\
  \ than everything I had always dreamt of. His arabic traces and his (very) particular\
  \ style made me forget about every man ideal I had built during my life. He told\
  \ me he would really appreciate if I let him take me to his favorite place in the\
  \ island. Still a bit nervous about what was happening and chocked how life seems\
  \ to be messing around with us all the time, I thought \"what could go wrong?\"\
  \ and accepted.\n\nYoussef took me to Hanauma Bay, which became my favorite place\
  \ in the world. The color of the sea was even more amazing than in C\xF4te d'Azur,\
  \ and as I told him that, I was impressed he had never leaved Hawaii since he moved\
  \ there when he was two. The guy had basically lived all his life in the same city\
  \ but he had more knowledge of the world than I, who had travelled all around the\
  \ world. Every minute, I got more and more enthusiastic about how people were happier\
  \ in that place - a day in the city, and my parameters were changed: I was dying\
  \ to spend the year with tan lines and salty hair. Also, the climate of that island\
  \ was insane, in the middle of june a fresh breeze made my hair a little messy while\
  \ I thought about the NYC bitter cold I hated so much. Little by little, the weird\
  \ coffee shop guy and the charming city were warming up my freezing new-yorker heart.\n\
  \nEvery second of the days I spent in Oahu was amazing and I owe it to Youssef.\
  \ He convinced me I didn't need much to find happiness and so I decided to sell\
  \ all my luxury items and experience a new life in Honolulu. You never know, maybe\
  \ we'll write a nice love story."
