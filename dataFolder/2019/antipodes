Text: "Antipodes, are a fascination of mine. Two places on diametrically opposite\
  \ ends of the earth connected through an imaginary portal.\nThe word antipodes comes\
  \ from Greek \"with feet opposite\". This was later adopted into Latin as antipodes.\
  \ The Latin word changed its sense from the original \"under the feet, opposite\
  \ side\" to \"those with the feet opposite\". This meaning sparked my first interest.\
  \ My curious mind often wonders what is happening in the world opposite to my feet.\
  \ \n\nThen suddenly a bizarre realization dawned on me, many of the countries I\
  \ have chosen to spend time during my 20s and 30's had this uncanny antipodal connection.\
  \ I was actually living this dream of spending the last decade experiencing these\
  \ other worlds. Toronto to Perth, Indonesia to Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand\
  \ to the country of my family origins, Portugal. \n\nMadeira, Portugal is the birthplace\
  \ of my ancestors, many of who eventually settled in Australia, after spending several\
  \ decades in the West Indies. Turns out Madeira has an antipodal connection to Norfolk\
  \ Island, situated not far off the Australian coast in the Tasman Sea. Having spent\
  \ the past decade living in Australia and swimming daily in the same Tasman Sea,\
  \ my desire is to now understand and document the adventures that are simultaneously\
  \ being experienced on exactly the opposite end of the earth. \n\nMy infatuation\
  \ comes not only from my family origins but from what the contrasts of these antipodal\
  \ sister countries could teach other travelers and adventurers. There is potential\
  \ to learn these cultures have great similarities despite not possibly being further\
  \ away from each other. When I was young lad, the end of the earth seemed so far\
  \ and unattainable. However the scale of the world (and distance between antipodes)\
  \ has been adjusted considerably after being given the opportunity to sit in a smokey\
  \ 'rumshop' in Barbados as well as a smokey 'warung' in rural Indonesia. Having\
  \ eaten 'sushi' in Tokyo and 'picanha' in Porto Alegre. Chasing powder in the 'snowy'\
  \ mountains of Mont Tremblant and surfing the 'sharky' waters of Margaret River.\
  \ \n\nThe one glaring connection between all these pairs of destinations being ANTIPODES.\n\
  \nMy curiosity drives me to wonder what other connections exist between these geographically\
  \ contrasting destinations?\n\nPortugal is now the next obvious choice for my next\
  \ antipodal adventure. \n\nJ\n\U0001F609"
