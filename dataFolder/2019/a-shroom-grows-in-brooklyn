Text: "I moved to an apartment in Brooklyn. It's one block away from Popeye\u2019\
  s Louisiana Kitchen, and the smell of recycled oil follows me home each night. I'm\
  \ reminded that \u201Chome\u201D is an ongoing investigation.\n\nJuly in Brooklyn\
  \ heralds portable speakers and barbecues in the park; neighbors gossip while they\
  \ stand in the middle of the sidewalk (and I\u2019ll tell you right now: they move\
  \ for no one.) I fool myself into thinking that things will change---that I\u2019\
  ll get a good night\u2019s sleep and finally get that job; that I won\u2019t mind\
  \ dirty shoes in the apartment or that I\u2019ll run into my future husband on 51st\
  \ and 5th. I tell myself that I\u2019ll harden or the city will soften.\n\nBut that\
  \ hasn\u2019t happened yet.\n\nTwo weeks ago, water flooded the bathroom of a sixth\
  \ floor apartment in our building. We live on the fourth floor, which means this\
  \ should have been an isolated case (except it\u2019s New York, and everything\u2019\
  s intertwined and messy and loud, like a chaotic orgy that we\u2019re all jumping\
  \ in to join). My roommates and I noticed water seeping into the walls, short-circuiting\
  \ a few electrical outlets. This was bad enough but then something strange happened:\
  \ a mushroom sprouted out of the bathroom wall.\n\nNow, I must qualify that this\
  \ is not my personal bathroom (I have my own) but that does not mean it doesn\u2019\
  t impact my roommates. It also doesn\u2019t mean that I can\u2019t get really mad\
  \ when our complaints to management are minimized. Were it my bathroom, I think\
  \ I would have consumed the magical mushroom. At least then I could avoid the crushing\
  \ truth that our rent supports conditions like these. After all, I\u2019m not looking\
  \ to distill truffle oil out of a bathroom-grown mushroom.  It\u2019s just not my\
  \ thing.\n\nBut here\u2019s an interesting fact about mushrooms: over 30 species\
  \ glow in the dark. Their bioluminescence produce so much light that people have\
  \ been known to use them in the woods, illuminating their way through dark nights\
  \  (think the Light of E\xE4rendil for you Lord of the Rings fans out there).\n\
  Our special mushroom disappeared almost as soon as it appeared (not uncommon for\
  \ mushrooms\u2026or men I\u2019ve dated, I might add). Strangely, I can\u2019t help\
  \ but wonder if the mushroom and I are somehow interconnected, like two species\
  \ that survive in unlikely places and feed light into dark nights.\n\nMaybe the\
  \ mushroom and I enter and exit New York swiftly but memorably. \n\nMaybe."
