Text: "I like to approach traveling to a new country for the first time much the same\
  \ way I approach watching a movie or seeing a broadway show. Sure, I\u2019ve seen\
  \ some of the previews. I\u2019ve heard people talking about it; their likes, their\
  \ dislikes, etc. I\u2019ve got a general sense of what it\u2019s all about. But\
  \ I prefer to learn the story as it presents itself to me, in real time. Some would\
  \ call this unpreparedness, but I find joy in the unknown. \n\nI couldn\u2019t wait\
  \ to have my fill of pretzels and beer on my first trip to Munich, but I was delighted\
  \ to discover there\u2019s so much more to the city than the cheery bavarian culture\
  \ portrayed across pop culture, and its contrasting history as the epicenter of\
  \ the Nazi regime during WWII.\n\nThe introduction was more or less what I expected.\
  \ Being my second trip to Western Europe, I had some idea of what I was getting\
  \ myself into. This was \u201CEurope: The Sequel\u201D for me. \n\nNo sooner had\
  \ my Bavarian sojourn begun however,  it became clear that predictability would\
  \ not be the prevailing theme of this trip. On my first venture into the city, I\
  \ stumbled across a riverfront with rocky banks covered in hundreds of\u2026 sunbathers!\
  \ It was as though they\u2019d been transported directly from a sandy coast onto\
  \ this riverbank. \n\nI considered joining them later as I sauntered alongside the\
  \ river and allowed Google reviews to lead me to a highly rated pub to catch a World\
  \ Cup match. Germany had already been eliminated, so I wasn\u2019t worried about\
  \ crowds, which was foolish of me. The pub was overflowing into the plaza outside.\
  \ I could barely see any of the television screens, much less hear the announcers\
  \ over the din of emphatic football fans and clinking of Ma\xDF. My defeat must\
  \ have been pretty obvious, because the employee assigned to keep watch over the\
  \ excitable crowd suggested I check the adjoining pub, and assured me there would\
  \ be seating, as it was in the basement, and everyone wanted to be outside on this\
  \ beautiful summer night. \n\nMy heart was instantly lighter upon entering the dimly\
  \ lit bar and realizing it was in fact an Australian pub, right in the heart of\
  \ Munich. I had lived in Australia  in the year prior and missed it very much. I\
  \ sipped on sweet Bundaberg rum in a nostalgic reverie while Croatia overtook Germany\
  \ in the quarter-final game.\n\nAs it turns out, sipping on rum from any country\
  \ is not the best preparation for a bike tour in the hot summer sun, but I convinced\
  \ myself fresh air and a history lesson were reason enough to get out of bed the\
  \ next morning. \n\nLittle did I know a pub with Bundaberg rum was not where the\
  \ Munich\u2019s similarities would stop. As we peddled through the scenic English\
  \ Gardens, I was positively dumbfounded when we stopped on a bridge to look out\
  \ over Eisbach, a popular surfing spot. First sunbathers, now surfers. Germany may\
  \ be landlocked, but that doesn\u2019t seem to stop its inhabitants from seeking\
  \ their fill of beach thrills. \n\nWe peddled away from the quirky river feature\
  \ and I assumed we\u2019d be slipping back into the historical narrative that often\
  \ accompanies such tours. But as we approached the next stop, a statue honoring\
  \ a renaissance composer, I could see there was a plot twist. The statue was covered\
  \ in tributes of all sorts to Michael Jackson, maintained daily by two formerly\
  \ feuding but unquestionably loyal fan clubs.\n\nIn the days that followed, I found\
  \ myself uncovering many delightful surprises hidden amongst the anticipated all\
  \ over Munich, my favorite being a rock and roll museum atop the tower in Olympic\
  \ Park. Unfortunately, I also found myself very ill, with a frozen bank account,\
  \ and after a few challenging days, the best and most welcome surprise came in the\
  \ form of my trip\u2019s heroine- a host who welcomed me into her home like a daughter.\
  \  As she made a dinner of wurst and spatzle, she welcomed me to have a look around\
  \ the apartment, and resting in the corner, was a surfboard."
