Text: "Village lanes hung with glowing red silk lanterns, canals bridged with arched\
  \ stone steps worn smooth over centuries, doors of weathered wood and gardens behind\
  \ classical Han dynasty windows, the calls of the travelling butcher with his bicycle\
  \ market of raw meat, the delicious odor of steamed dumplings and chili sauce, the\
  \ dark and silent nights free of street lamps, Buddhist monks chanting and the Islamic\
  \ call to prayer welcoming the dawn together with the splash of laundry washing\
  \ in the clean morning stream\u2026..life in China\u2019s Ancient Water Towns. \n\
  \nThis is what I expected to find from reading Pearl Buck\u2019s compelling novels\
  \ set in ancient China. And I did!  What I didn\u2019t expect was how many ancient\
  \ towns there are, how very different they are, and how ordinary people just carry\
  \ on their mundane daily tasks while living is such a magical setting.  I thought:\
  \  if you\u2019ve seen one, haven\u2019t you seen them all?  Still, like an addict,\
  \ I repeatedly booked days to spend in many Ancient Towns:   Xi\u2019an \u2013 home\
  \ of the terracotta warriors, Sanhe near Hefei where I work seasonally at USTC,\
  \ Wuzhen Water Town on the Grand Canal, Qibao inside Shanghai, iconic Dali,  Xizhou\
  \ lazing in the Yunnan sun, Lijiang where I got supremely lost, Shuhe in the mountains\
  \ near Tibet, Ciqikou on the steep river bank in Chongqing. \n\nAlthough it looks\
  \ like it, I wasn\u2019t really on a tour of ancient villages; it happens that all\
  \ major cities and all regions have ancient villages or water towns. My recent trip\
  \ to China included these ten, but I became overwhelmed, fearing I had overdosed.\
  \  Which had the three stunning ivory pagodas? Which was on the Tea Horse Road?\
  \ Which boasts an annual World Internet Conference? I could only \u201Cdetox\u201D\
  \ myself by focusing on what made them different. \n\n\u2022\tSome have fresh flowing\
  \ rivers where painters set up easels; some only lustrous lily ponds where children\
  \ pick fronds for sunshades.\n\u2022\tSome are mazes of canals with arching bridges\
  \ and gondola-like boats; some sit on the edge of fishing lakes.\n\u2022\tAll have\
  \ countless souvenir shops, but some have authentic crafts and artisans selling\
  \ genuinely useful memorabilia, like small wooden buckets from Lili River Town or\
  \ bespoke burial caskets in Xizhou.\n\u2022\tMost have delicious street food and\
  \ sumptuous restaurants; all have specialties that either delight or repulse the\
  \ Western stomach \u2013 like famously revolting Suzhou stinky tofu.\n\u2022\tMany\
  \ have local inns throughout the village; some, like Lijiang World Heritage Site,\
  \ have massive Western-style hotel complexes. \n\u2022\tSome, like Wuzhen, have\
  \ carefully designed promotion campaigns and hordes of tourists; some still offer\
  \ a genuine chance to go back in time, as in Pingyao.\n\u2022\tLike Xian, some are\
  \ bounded by massive walls and imperial gates; some just appear as old districts\
  \ in modern cities, like the hutongs of Beijing.\n\u2022\tSome are famous for unique\
  \ architecture \u2013 like the spectacular tulou forts in the Fujian mountains.\n\
  \u2022\tSome are best enjoyed with a guide's insight; some are easy to ramble mindlessly.\n\
  \u2022\tAll are great for walking, all were highly photogenic, all are memorable\
  \ for different reasons.\n\nUsing this approach, I determined what made each town\
  \ memorable for me and rated the most:\n\u2022\tengaging and authentic - Pingyao\n\
  \u2022\tevolved and impressive - Xian\n\u2022\trecent and regional - Sanhe\n\u2022\
  \tdismal and disappointing \u2013 Wuzhen, which hosts international conferences\n\
  \u2022\taccessible and surprising - Qibao\n\u2022\tcongenial and bodacious \u2013\
  \ Dali, with its iconic pagodas\n\u2022\ton the edge - Xizhou\n\u2022\tphotogenic\
  \ and overwhelming - Lijiang\n\u2022\trural and rustic \u2013 Shuhe, trailhead of\
  \ the Tea Horse Road\n\u2022\tsteps and food stalls - Ciqikou\n\nDuring the Cultural\
  \ Revolution, many ancient towns were destroyed because they represented a feudal\
  \ past, but China is assiduously preserving them now, even building new \u201Cancient\
  \ towns.\u201D Every year, I check Sanhe Ancient Town near Hefei to see what new\
  \ \u201Cold\u201D things have been added. I guess I should have expected that, with\
  \ the super-charged tourist boom taking place in China and the appeal of the ancient\
  \ towns as an idealized past.  But I couldn\u2019t have expected that, in Xizhou\
  \ Ancient Village where scarlet red coffins are made exclusively for those who live\
  \ beyond 100 years, I would reserve one for myself \u2013 for much later. \n\n*My\
