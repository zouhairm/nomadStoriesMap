Text: "On a recent trip to Nadi, Fiji my companion and I decided to get off the beaten\
  \ track and hire a car for a few days to explore the Island. We asked some locals\
  \ where the best beach to go to was and they pointed us in the direction of Natadola.\
  \ A famous Fijian resort beach with white sandy shorelines and pristine aqua water\
  \ filled with an array of exotic tropical fish. While I'll admit the car cost us\
  \ a small fortune to hire, the experience was priceless. \n\nWe headed South on\
  \ the main road, noting there really is only one road around the whole Island. We\
  \ kept going until we came across a sign to Natadola. The map we were handed at\
  \ the car hire place was basic and the signs to destinations sparse. Luckily, locals\
  \ are unbelievably hospitable and warm to interact with.  We turn right towards\
  \ our destination and keep following the road along... as we travel the road seems\
  \ to get more and more rustic and gravelled. \n\nI turn to my companion \"could\
  \ this really be the road to Fiji's most famous beach?\" I query. We shrug our shoulders\
  \ and keep going. We spot some resident goats in the bushes along the way, they\
  \ stare out at us vacantly, there is a serenity and freedom that engulfs each and\
  \ every moment along the journey.\n\nEventually our car arrives in a small village.\
  \ \"Could this possibly be our beach?\" we both ponder.  A friendly local comes\
  \ up to our car, \"are you lost?\" he asks in pidgeon English. We ask him for directions\
  \ to Natadola. He gets us to park the car and we follow him over a hill to a beautiful\
  \ beach in front of his Village... It doesn't seem like the location we were told\
  \ about but we decide to jump in nonetheless. \n\nWe wonder down the shoreline until\
  \ we come across another village on the foreshore. Sure enough, a local resident\
  \ approaches us and invites us in for fish and cassava soup. The fish had been freshly\
  \ caught off the reef that morning. The soup is amazing and the people authentically\
  \ kind.\nWe meet the whole family, grandad, wife, sister,  brother, nephew.. and\
  \ we are soon greeted by neighbours too. The locals are lovely. They invite us to\
  \ stay. We politely decline. They give us a tour of their village and gently point\
  \ us in the direction of Natadola beach, a few kilometers back up the road in front\
  \ of a resort.  We thank them for their hospitality and exchange email addresses\
  \ promising to stay in touch. \n\nThey make a profound and touching comment \"We\
  \ don't understand why people come to Fiji to stay in resorts. This is Fiji. We\
  \ have such a good life here, we are happy to welcome people to see the real Fiji\"\
  .\n\nWe were thrilled to hang with locals and have exposure to life in Fiji. \n\n\
  We set off and head up to Natadola. The cost is $40 Fijian to enter the resort and\
  \ gain access to the beach front. The $40 included a meal at the resort.  Natadola\
  \ was magical and the food at the resort divine, with breathtaking Insta views every\
  \ which way you looked.\n\nDespite its beauty, I couldn't help but feel that the\
  \ experience and beach that would stay imprinted in my mind and on my soul was back\
  \ at the village of Malo Malo with our new friend Ip."
