Text: "I suffered from a bout of agoraphobia in my twenties \u2013 more likely brought\
  \ on by going through seven high schools in three years and two college in three\
  \ years.  During a weepy episode combined with loneliness and aggravating proximity\
  \ to New York City, my mother said to me, \u201Care you going to sit on your ass\
  \ the rest of your life and wait for someone to ask you to do something or are you\
  \ going to get out there and do it?\u201D \n\nFast forward a few decades and many\
  \ frequent flyer miles to last November. That comment came back to me in spades.\
  \  I had placed the winning bid one a five-day trip to the Maldives.  Many a friend\
  \ had professed to an interest in joining me on the adventure; only to back out.\
  \  After shifting the dates, a third time, to one that wasn\u2019t even really convenient\
  \ to me, yet another friend canceled.  There I was again, red-eyed and exhausted.\
  \  Mom\u2019s words came ringing back to me.  Well, was I going to throw away the\
  \ trip or just go on my own?\n\nWith trepidation, I boarded the first plane across\
  \ country and then another across the ocean, until finally reaching the warm, humid\
  \ breezes of Male.  There, I schlepped across the airport to the float plane docks.\
  \  Greeted by young, friendly pilots \u2013 neither of whom were wearing shoes!\
  \ \u2013 I made the last leg of the journey, a small fan trying gallantly to cool\
  \ the entire plane.  Cruising over waters the colors of aquamarine, turquoise, cerulean\
  \ and more, when finally, we landed\u2026in the middle of nowhere, water lapping\
  \ exuberantly against the pontons, the pilots opened the door and said this was\
  \ my stop.  Really?\n\nA floating dock with a sign denoting it as an international\
  \ airport?  Hum, maybe this wasn\u2019t a good idea.  I guess the pilots saw my\
  \ confusion and said no to worry, the boat would be there in 5-10 minutes.  Now\
  \ I was wishing that I: a) had taken some of the alcohol bottles off the flight\
  \ and b) that I had more sun screen with me.  Yep, I had truly landed in the middle\
  \ of nowhere.  Friends were right to beg off the trip.  No cell service.  No bottled\
  \ water.  So much for this world traveler.\n\nAfter a long enough interim where\
  \ I if I had organized by paperwork back home, a boat pulled up.  The GM of the\
  \ resort, a lovely Englishman in white shorts, bade me to board the boat and brought\
  \ me a drink.  He filled me on what the resort had to offer, not the least of which\
  \ was seclusion.  Yes, I had found the middle of nowhere.  It had warm sand, clear\
  \ waters through which you could see the stingrays and other local marine life swimming\
  \ and the best cucumber mojitos I had ever had. \n\nFor five days, my routine consisted\
  \ of breakfast and a lone chaise lounge under an umbrella, close enough to the ocean\u2019\
  s waters to dip my toes in when I got overheated.  Had I traveled thousands of miles\
  \ alone to realize that being alone is okay?  Maybe that wasn\u2019t the initial\
  \ plan, but sometimes you do things that frighten you to test your abilities and\
  \ to learn something.  Quiet. Slow. Unplugged.  These are things we don\u2019t get\
  \ that often.  Appreciate them when they come along and renew yourself."
