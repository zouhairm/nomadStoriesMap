Text: "Well I started travelling solo ever since I had me time, and trekking became\
  \ a part of my life. Chadar trek was one of my fantasy to go for and hence planned\
  \ the trip from 17 January,2018 - 27 January, 2018. tre in extreme climate with\
  \ -35 degree to -40 degree temperature, snow fall happening any time. I was the\
  \ only girl in the group of 10 people, each being a stranger to other as it served\
  \ the theme UNITY IN DIVERSITY each from different parts of country. soon after\
  \ starting our journey from second base camp we all started interacting with each\
  \ other and in very short span I got to connect with Mahesh and Prashant well as\
  \ we had the common travel stories to share.  We used to start early and reach the\
  \ destined stop well before time.  \nthis way got to connect with our group very\
  \ well. On the 4rd day of our trek, I got to know about the satellite calling phone\
  \ on the height of 18000 ft, but no one in my group was ready to hike that up and\
  \ go for it, but i was stubborn enough that I need to go up and make a call to my\
  \ family whom I wanted to surprise them. \nBut I was adamant to go up , so I told\
  \ my Guide that i will hike to that village so called Nyrak. it is called Mini switzerland,\
  \ we hiked to that place in almost 40 mins and it was the mesmerising experience\
  \ and treat to eyes. \nI love interacting with people whenever i am travelling \n\
  it is the best experience of travelling solo, you can enjoy lot of home stays where\
  \ and what ever time you like if you know how to communicate and be good to people\
  \ arond.\nlooking forward for my more solo trips .\n\nBelieve me the people out\
  \ their were so calm and composed and down to earth, they treated us so well with\
  \ Kashmiri QAHWA( Herbal Tea) and above that they survive in such harsh climatic\
  \ conditions through out the year.\nThey provide classes to small kids in that harsh\
  \ conditions to make them literate.\nWe all liked this initiative of them and offered\
  \ them some monetary help, firstly they denied as it was against their fundamentals,\
  \ but when we insisted them they took it.\nWe took their contact details and promised\
  \ to help them some way or the other in their education program to educate their\
  \ children who are having dreams in their eyes and are fighting such harsh conditions.\n\
  this is how we developed the local connection a way to connect people ho being so\
  \ stranger still seems so connected to heart."
