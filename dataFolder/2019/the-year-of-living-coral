Text: "The three of us were huddled around a fire, next to a politely inquisitive\
  \ and well-traveled Australian couple. The night was colder than we thought it would\
  \ be for three native Iowans who are used to rough winters. We were given blankets\
  \ and the opposite of a buffet line, as the buffet itself was brought directly to\
  \ our table. We ate a variety of delicious foods we didn\u2019t know the exact names\
  \ or contents of and ordered a round of Long Island Iced Teas to cheers the New\
  \ Year of Living Coral. In just a few hours, I would be turning 29 in India.\n\n\
  What started as a casual comment  last summer turned into a full-on whirlwind adventure\
  \ of preparation (or lack thereof) for a slightly last-minute trip to India. Passports\
  \ were renewed, flights were anxiously booked, shots were unfortunately given, a\
  \ new travel-approved backpack was purchased and the itinerary was loosely created\
  \ all within less than two months. We were about to spend the holidays away from\
  \ family, visiting a faraway friend in a new-to-us land and embarking on the unknown.\n\
  \nBy the time we made it Jaipur, we\u2019d already forgotten about the 18 hour flight\
  \ and three hour wait in customs. For the most part. Our bodies were still adjusting\
  \ to the time zone, the food and the ever present honking of horns. We hopped off\
  \ the plane, met with our driver (who suddenly stopped for more beer - I mean it\
  \ was New Year\u2019s Eve, afterall) and checked into our eerily lit, vintage vibe\
  \ hotel. Within the hour, the three of us were ready to explore this new city that\
  \ would serve as the backdrop of a brand new year.\n\nAfter the buffet filled us\
  \ to the brim, we filled our glasses to the rim. A chance encounter would lead us\
  \ to find our people. Four Jaipur gentlemen would become our unofficial tour guides\
  \ for the rest of the evening/early morning. Worlds collided as we celebrated traditions,\
  \ both old and new, and danced under an Indian sky full of fireworks. They chauffeured\
  \ us around to various hot spots throughout the city and even ended up getting me\
  \ a piece of cake as we sang karaoke tunes in unison. It was the sweetest gesture\
  \ from a group of strangers who made my friends and I feel so welcome in their home.\n\
  \nWhen Pantone declared 2019, The Year of Living Coral, I knew it would be. I knew\
  \ it would be the year of living that followed the year of loss. I knew it would\
  \ be adventurous and wild, and freeing and full. I did not know, however, that a\
  \ night in Jaipur, India, surrounded by close friends and brand new ones, would\
  \ set the tone for the rest of my 2019 journey. This faraway trip into the unknown,\
  \ would make for an excellent experience ahead of many more unknowns to come."
