Text: "In this dusty oasis town, where it is much too hot, the children shake the\
  \ trees. Their friends, lethargic and impatient, clutch at woven fabrics, sometimes\
  \ bedsheets, one in each tasseled corner, in this way collecting the deluge of mulberries\
  \ falling like ripe lazy grubs. Some effort is made to gather the excess on the\
  \ street; all that remains rots into it as a tablecloth of sweet, sickly nectar.\n\
  \nDeep into summer, the trellised walkways bloom with bougainvillea. Apart from\
  \ the mulberries that redden and ripen and burst, so do the grapes, dates, peaches\
  \ and melons. Yet the hat sellers, busy playing chess, fan themselves nonchalantly,\
  \ still unwilling to replace their Soviet fur-lined hats for Supreme and Gucci knock-offs.\
  \ I\u2019ve been looking for a replacement ever since I left mine on a train.  \n\
  \nAromas of cumin and smoke waft through the Broadway. Come evening, these roadside\
  \ eateries will be filled with diners on plastic stools eating kebabs and drinking\
  \ beer. The sun will not set until well past 11pm; even after midnight, light lingers\
  \ at the edges of the sky and silhouettes the leftover baskets of mulberries on\
  \ messy table tops in the bazaar. \n\nMost of the Chinese came by rail or air; the\
  \ Europeans came often on their bicycles, chasing a love affair with distance. They\
  \ wanted to see the last untouched corner of China, closer to Islamabad than to\
  \ Peking. They shared with me stories of Cassanova and Napoleon and loved talking\
  \ about their hometowns. Under the unblinking gaze of CCTV I checked them in, recording\
  \ their whereabouts in a tedious process. We were one of the only lodges in the\
  \ region that could accommodate them.\n \nI accompanied them to the Last Gate of\
  \ the Great Wall, over 5000 km from the wall's easternmost point. It was literally\
  \ the final defense of the empire, where China ended and beyond which lay a terrifying\
  \ unknown. From the garrison towers, the bleached desolation of terra incognita\
  \ only added to the melancholy: it was here that disgraced officials and the otherwise\
  \ condemned, broken, fleeing and exiled made their final, bitter farewells. What\
  \ would this garrison look like in a further thousand years? Ironic how what\u2019\
  s left of us lasts in what is least us.\n\nWe chartered mini-busses and drove up\
  \ the Karakorum Highway, photographing alpine lakes and remote forgotten villages\
  \ inhabited by obscure ethnicities. Behind us, the desert gave way to monoliths\
  \ of rock and snow. Prayer flags yearned for the heavens, spreading their blessings\
  \ by virtue of ice and wind; somewhere scrambled within those peaks rose indomitable\
  \ K2. Dropping the travelers at the Border, many continued to Gilgit. One day, I\
  \ might cross into Pakistan too.\n\nOn my days off, I ate grilled lamb and hand-pulled\
  \ noodles and beef dumplings roasted on coals and cold fruit with saffron flavored\
  \ ice cream. I drank black tea served in porcelain teapots laced with gold on the\
  \ turquoise terraces of the tea house. I read. Cold beverage in hand, I roamed the\
  \ dry winding streets of Old Town and New Old Town alike. In the evenings, we drank\
  \ beer and baijiu and cracked pumpkin seeds between our teeth as we sang ballads\
  \ in the courtyard of the hostel and made out in the all the blind corners, which\
  \ I knew of from watching the cameras during my shifts.\n\nI\u2019d be leaving by\
  \ summer\u2019s end. As I counted down the days, I tried to savor the moments between\
  \ light and dusk. Every day was a slow exquisite dream. In the future, when my focus\
  \ shifts and Pakistan is a faded dream, I would look back on these languid halcyon\
  \ days with sanguine eyes. I wished I could dry these thoughts emotions dreams of\
  \ today in shallow straw trays like raisins under the blazing unyielding sun, in\
  \ this way safeguarding them against the corruption and erosion of a complex and\
  \ perpetual future, but as much as I tried to preserve those fleeting strands of\
  \ now, they kept slipping through my fingers, a stream of fine mica powder running\
  \ like those endless restless nights filled with longing, like the flags craving\
  \ for the heavens, the children for the mulberries, and the cyclists for the distance."
