Text: "I am a solo woman traveller who had her own second thoughts and paranoia every\
  \ time I set out on a solo trip. Fortunately every time, the world proves to me\
  \ that that I need not have worried that much. \n\nI've been to Kodaikanal, Ooty,\
  \ Valparai, Western ghats, Top Slip, Rishikesh, Chopta and Chandrasila Himalayas\
  \ - these are the mountains; Varkala, Gokarna, Goa, Pondicherry, Chennai - these\
  \ are beaches. \n\nEvery time, I have learnt that people whom you meet everywhere\
  \ have a life of their own, and a beautiful one at that, and they will not harm\
  \ you for any reason. They have their own life, their own profession and we are\
  \ just passersby along their perennial river like life. Sometimes it's okay to admit\
  \ that you're a tourist, because the connection with the locals would be a very\
  \ different experience if we do.\n\nAll the hostellers, hoteliers, taxi and ric\
  \ drivers that I've met are all absolute gold. They tell us everything, they will\
  \ be so enthusiastic to make is experience. You learn about a particular neighborhood,\
  \ a particular speciality of a street, a bridge and a beach. You hear how Gods in\
  \ the epics used to take the trail that you're walking and how they took a dip in\
  \ the lake that's right in front of you. Not to mention, the fellow passengers in\
  \ a train or a bus or even the bus conductor gives you a special care. Everyone\
  \ wants to help you, everyone wants to make sure you have a good, worthy time. \n\
  \nThis is what travel is about. Experiencing more and more blessings to count, traversing\
  \ the whole way \"safely\", learning that people make a place what it is: their\
  \ peculiarity in their taste, adaptability to the environment, habits, all with\
  \ one common string puller - love."
