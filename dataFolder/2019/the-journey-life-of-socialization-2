Text: "This trip happened in 2014 where I need to visit several provinces in Indonesia\
  \ to give financial socialization on the micro insurance for villagers. \nFrom the\
  \ big city to the remote areas, from West to the East, tight schedule and catching\
  \ the flights with one purpose that people can open their mind and accept the government\
  \ programme. Me and my team need to done the socialization by 1,5 month only for\
  \ 12 provinces (Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang, Surabaya, Malang, Lombok, Bali, Aceh,\
  \ Banjarmasin, Makassar, Ambon and Saumlaki). \nAll the provinces are not the same\
  \ and totally different, the food, the beach, the nature, the people, the culture.\
  \ This journey is part of my life experiences that absolutely will never forget,\
  \ starts from the preparation before, how to bring so many stuff, prepare the on\
  \ spot location where sometimes villagers didn't want to leave their job and we\
  \ need to held the socialization on spot sometimes in the rice fields or beach for\
  \ fisherman, the rejection and how I need to deal with that, the warmth welcome\
  \ from the local people who really kind-hearted, the obstacles to the location,\
  \ the daily report, and many things that this journey super memorable for me. \n\
  Trough this journey I learnt so many things where I can see outside there from different\
  \ prespective and from this journey also I  started to explore more and see more\
  \ what kind of world outside there."
