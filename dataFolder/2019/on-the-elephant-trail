  \ zoomed through the hilly vegetation of Rambukkana as we hurriedly made our way\
  \ to the destination. Nilantha was convinced that what to witness was a must-see.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou cannot leave this island without visiting this place,\u201D he beamed\
  \ widely, his characteristic Sri Lankan smile filling almost all corners of our\
  \ tiny three-wheeled taxi. \n\nAfter crossing a few more steep hills, our destination\
  \ soon loomed above the jungle foliage in all its Sri Lankan stateliness. \n\n\u201C\
  Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage,\u201D announced Nilantha proudly, \u201CSri Lanka\u2019\
  s largest sanctuary for orphaned baby and adult elephants.\u201D \n\nIntrigued,\
  \ I gazed at the main signboard which had arrows spouting off in all directions.\
  \ Our mission was to feed a baby elephant, and going by the imposing black sign,\
  \ we were headed towards the obscurely named \u2018milk-feeding place.\u2019 The\
  \ session was to begin at nine, but given the way time works in the country, we\
  \ knew it could at least be an hour later before any event would start. \n\n\u201C\
  Just wait here, they\u2019ll ring a bell, and soon the little ones will appear!\u201D\
  \ said Nilantha excitedly. \n\nWe were now in a sandy compound with jungle all around\
  \ us. Not an elephant to be seen, although our tour guide was convinced that was\
  \ going to change very shortly. \n\nAt last the park ranger rang a huge iron bell,\
  \ its shrill noise reverberating all around the jungle, sending birds high into\
  \ the sky. What happened next though was pure magic. It was like I had been transported\
  \ back to my primary school days, only this time, my schoolmates were baby elephants!\
  \ \n\nAs if they were running late for class, the little elephants burst out of\
  \ the shrubland and stampeded towards the large milk bottles that had been prepared\
  \ for them. I was also smiling now and could not help but tear up affectionately\
  \ at all the cuteness on display. As if on cue, the youngsters arranged themselves\
  \ hastily in single file as each one waited their turn to be fed their milk. They\
  \ would curl up their little trunk, open their mouth eagerly as they impatiently\
  \ encouraged you to feed them. All you had to do was squirt a bit of the milk from\
  \ your given bottle and they would lap it up hungrily. It was a truly exhilarating\
  \ encounter. \n\nSome of the bigger baby elephants would push the smaller ones out\
  \ of the way and take their place in the line. Others would pretend to trot off\
  \ back into the jungle after they\u2019d had their fill, only to quietly join the\
  \ line again for another greedy serve of milk. It appeared even the animal kingdom\
  \ was not immune from schoolyard bullying. The park rangers were aware of this,\
  \ and always ensured each baby elephant received their fair share. \n\n\u201CThey\u2019\
  re like children,\u201D laughed Nilantha, \u201Cit\u2019s only when you get up close\
  \ and personal with these creatures that you realise, we\u2019re not really much\
  \ different from them.\u201D \n\nOver the hill, another prominent elephant activity\
  \ was about to begin. As the ground began to rumble softly, we were advised to stand\
  \ on the side of the footpath. It was time for a bath, I was told. Right on cue,\
  \ a most majestic sight unfolded. Pinnawala\u2019s adult orphaned elephants marched\
  \ slowly through the parting crowd, as the mahouts on either side guided them towards\
  \ the river for their weekly cleanse. \n\nSomething was amiss with this scene. Whereas\
  \ the baby elephants seemed excited, lively and full of carefree youthful vigour,\
  \ the adult group seemed far less enthralled. What was more concerning was that\
  \ they were all draped in heavy chains, with some wrapped tightly around their feet,\
  \ and they walked at a pace that would be determined by the mahouts who aggressively\
  \ pointed sharp bull-hooks at them to keep them in line. \n\n\u201CAre these elephants\
  \ happy Nilantha?\u201D I asked worriedly. \n\n\u201CDefinitely!\u201D he replied\
  \ dismissively. \u201CIt\u2019s been this way for over 40 years.\u201D \n\nSaddened,\
  \ I decided to make for the exit. What good was the promise of freedom, if those\
  \ babies would also be in chains one day? We were not like the elephants at all;\
  \ instead we have made them become unknowingly like us."
