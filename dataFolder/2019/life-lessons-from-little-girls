Text: "As we traversed one of the worlds most dangerous roads, ground escaping from\
  \ underneath the tyres, tumbling down an escarpment and landslides threatening from\
  \ above the other passengers and I exchanged nervous laughter.\n\nOnly a fortnight\
  \ earlier I had been sitting at work in outback Australia, when I decided to ask\
  \ my boss for a months leave so I could travel to Nepal and volunteer with an organisation\
  \ who help women and children at risk of human trafficking. He looked at me with\
  \ bewilderment but also a glint of interest. \u2018Okay,\u2019 he said. \u2018Approved\u2019\
  . I spent the next two weeks frantically gathering donations, teaching aids, and\
  \ learning materials. \n\nSo here I was on the precarious road from Kathmandu to\
  \ Hetauda. The 84km journey is best described as 5 hours of near-death experiences.\
  \ Buses flying around blind corners, people overtaking on tenuous ridges and an\
  \ assortment of wildlife to avoid. I finally arrived with a face caked in dust and\
  \ my ears still ringing from the symphony of car horns that acted as the soundtrack\
  \ of our journey. I silently thanked the bobbing Ganesh statue on the dashboard\
  \ for our safe arrival. Standing in front of a pale yellow building, animatedly\
  \ waving were a group of 25 women and children I would be spending my time with\
  \ and instantly my arduous journey was forgotten. \n\nThat night as we all shared\
  \ dinner, I sat on the floor and watched as all the children expertly mixed their\
  \ dahl and rice together with their hands and eagerly scooped it up into their mouths.\
  \ I tried to appear casual as I attempted to do the same, but the dahl was BOILING\
  \ HOT! Be cool, I told myself trying to appear unphased by my now scorched hand.\
  \ My face had given me away though and the children erupted into giggles \u2018\
  Didi, Didi use this\u2019 handing me a spoon. Although tempted, I persisted with\
  \ my throbbing hand.\n\n As I sat and observed everyone, one particular girl caught\
  \ my eye for she seemed as shy and unsure as I did in my new surrounds. Kaneila\
  \ was a beautiful girl with the wariness of a child who had already experienced\
  \ too much. I asked one of the coordinators about her and she informed me that she\
  \ had arrived at the safe home just a few hours before I had. Her father had passed\
  \ away shortly after she was born and her mother had abandoned her. She had been\
  \ found close-by to the Indian border which made her at very high risk of being\
  \ trafficked. I Imagined myself at age 12, entering a group home where I knew no\
  \ one, not knowing when or if I\u2019d see my few remaining family members again\
  \ and accepting that whether I liked it or not this would be my home now. Then I\
  \ realised that this was the reality for almost every child here.\n\n The weekend\
  \ came and went and with the new week came a big day. Kaneila would start school,\
  \ but although she was 12, she would be starting in the first grade. As she proudly\
  \ put on her crisp new uniform and knee socks I could feel her nervous energy. She\
  \ self consciously rebraided her hair countless times, each time it looking much\
  \ the same as the time before- then finally it was time. We walked quietly, towards\
  \ the school with all the other children jostling around us singing and laughing.\
  \ As we arrived at the school I worried for her, I worried the other children in\
  \ her class would make fun of her for being so much older, I worried she\u2019d\
  \ have another horrible experience she didn\u2019t deserve.\n\n I thought of her\
  \ many times throughout the day and my fears melted away into happiness when I saw\
  \ her return, her shy smile replaced with a wide grin. I felt so proud of her As\
  \ we sat down that afternoon to complete homework, I watched Kaneila pore over her\
  \ school books and the irony of the situation struck me- I was there to teach them,\
  \ but that afternoon a little girl in Nepal taught me about resilience and fear\
  \ and the opportunity that sits on the other side of it."
