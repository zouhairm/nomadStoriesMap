Text: "\u201CI am warm\u201D- Tom pauses, a tall Ni-Vanautu man, his body bare except\
  \ for \u2018namba\u2019; a small sheath covering his front. He searches for the\
  \ words and a big smile fills his face as he continues, \u201C- you are named after\
  \ our island\u201D. Tanna. An island which my mum and grandma visited years before\
  \ I did. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s still the same,\u201D said my grandma. \n\nWe were\
  \ greeted by the biggest smiles and kind, curious eyes. \n\nYoung girls chased each\
  \ other around in grass skirts. Barefoot. The earth\u2019s soil between their toes.\n\
  \nMothers sat on bamboo mats, an arm embracing their child while they made necklaces\
  \ from thread and seed. \n\nThe Banyan tree had its roots firmly planted in the\
  \ ground, like the traditions of this village. Its branches reached out at different\
  \ angles, all connected to each other. Strings of green leaves had woven their way\
  \ through and around the branches. \n\nTom took us down a dusty, dirt track, full\
  \ of trees, shrubs and long grass. The young girls and boys who joined us, hummed\
  \ sweet melodies and spoke in new and unusual sounds. Instead, the language we shared\
  \ were smiles- a universal language. Words weren\u2019t needed. \n\nA log, found\
  \ on the way transformed into a bridge and held our weight as we crossed a small\
  \ stream. Sideways, one foot at a time, I tried to keep my balance. Tom\u2019s hand\
  \ guided my grandma across. The children leapt across with ease and continued running\
  \ ahead.  \n\nOne girl, grabbed my hand and pulled me along. Before I knew it, my\
  \ feet were running underneath me. We took a turn off the track and cut through\
  \ grass as tall as we were. Right turn, left turn around the tree. The echoes of\
  \ laughter ahead were our navigation through this maze. The laughter, which became\
  \ closer, was accompanied by a rushing sound. \n\nTwo of the girls were already\
  \ under the waterfall, lifting cups of water between their hands and throwing it\
  \ above them. Two boys sat on rocks above the waterfall. They kept watch on the\
  \ girls and joined in laughing.  One held a wooden stick and a long knife which\
  \ looked like he had made. The other boy chewed a green leaf between his lips. \n\
  \nMy friend sat me down on a rock, near the boys. She cracked open a brown seed\
  \ to reveal smaller orange seeds inside. Her fingers looked like she had dipped\
  \ them in orange paint as she rubbed the seed between them. She took her time to\
  \ examine my face before she started. She made me feel welcome, I smiled and she\
  \ gave me one in return. Pressing two fingers against my skin, she moved them gently\
  \ across my cheek, leaving a trail of orange. She did the same on the other side.\
  \  Two orange stripes and one big smile. \n\nThe boys got their faces painted too.\
  \ She examined their faces, making sure the paint was even. The boy with the leaf\
  \ between his lips kept moving his head to talk to his friend. Once again, I heard\
  \ the sweet song of their language. The girl was patient, waiting for the boys to\
  \ finish their conversation. This took some time and I had to laugh, she shook her\
  \ head at them and laughed with me. She was kind. Finally, she put orange stripes\
  \ on herself. \n\nShe was in a grass-skirt. Barefoot. I wore jeans. Sandshoes. \n\
  \nShe had short hair. I had long braids. But we shared smiles. And we all had orange\
  \ stripes."
