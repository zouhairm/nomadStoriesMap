Text: "My eyes were fixed on the admission ticket for Alcazar de Segovia in my hand,\
  \ my feet firmly planted at the entrance at the Tower of Juan II. I peered at the\
  \ stairwell. I could see the first few steps and the rest disappeared into a winding\
  \ black abyss. It wasn\u2019t exactly welcoming.  \n\n\u201C152 steps,\u201D our\
  \ tour guide had quipped, looking at the group encouragingly. \u201CIt\u2019s a\
  \ lot of steps, but I promise you, it is worth it.\u201D \n\nI\u2019m sure the view\
  \ was worth it, but I was also sure of a couple other things: I did not want to\
  \ this, and I did not want to do this. \n\nI reluctantly allowed security to scan\
  \ my ticket and dragged my feet forward. My chest was already tight with anxiety.\
  \ I took the stairs slowly, grazing my hand against the wall of the tower. The space\
  \ was dimly lit, and I could see no signs of the sun. I did not want to do this.\
  \ \n\nThere was a large group of people shuffling behind me, buzzing with excitement\
  \ to take on the Tower of Juan II. My sullen expression remained the same. We were\
  \ hardly a quarter of the way up when I felt the beads of sweat line my forehead.\
  \ My hand was still grazing the uneven brick of the tower, searching for something\
  \ to hold on to. \n\nA sudden slew of voices was coming from above me. I froze as\
  \ I heard footsteps rumbling down the stairs. It hadn\u2019t occurred to me that\
  \ the way up would also be the only way down. The width of the tower was no larger\
  \ than a standard bathroom stall. As I watched the herd of bodies coming towards\
  \ me, time had slowed down. I was pressed back-against the tower wall, the roughness\
  \ of brick digging into my palms. Tears were welling in my eyes and my breath was\
  \ coming out ragged as I felt the pressure of arms, backs and chests against my\
  \ body. We had suddenly come to a standstill, the tiny space filled with too many\
  \ people. I didn\u2019t know why I was crying. \n\nI can\u2019t do this, I thought\
  \ as the tears continued to stream down my face. I can\u2019t do this. It\u2019\
  s not that I didn\u2019t want to climb the tower, it was that I didn\u2019t think\
  \ I could. I never thought I could. Here I was, sandwiched between a cold brick\
  \ wall and a middle-aged man doing his best to keep his grip on his toddler-aged\
  \ daughter, realizing that this helpless feeling of being stuck was something I\
  \ was all too familiar with.  The view at the top of the tower might be one that\
  \ I shouldn\u2019t miss, but did I even deserve to see it?\n\nThere was finally\
  \ some movement and I was able to peel myself from the wall. One foot in front of\
  \ the other, I thought. You might not want to do this, but you have to. My breathing\
  \ became more labored with each step I took. I kept my head down, praying to make\
  \ it out. I was sure this staircase wasn\u2019t going to end, and I was never going\
  \ to get out. But, the warmth of the sun hit the top of my head, coaxing me to look\
  \ up. I trudged up the last few steps and onto the landing, beads of sweat mixed\
  \ in with the tears on my face. \n\nMy tour guide was right. This view was one worth\
  \ seeing. And after being able to keep putting one foot in front of the other, I\
  \ deserved to bask in it."
