Text: "You know, tractable as we are, living in the city, advocating ourselves day\
  \ to day because that\u2019s the apparent plan. Getting away from this fixed unsynced\
  \ time table is something we all crave. An ambivert would always be conscious of\
  \ this thought but yet seldom would he take the correct steps in order to free his\
  \ mind and heart from this wrecked social world. Blessedly, Travelling and philosophizing\
  \ are the only two things in my world that give me an unfathomable sense of satisfaction\
  \ and happiness. I believe my actions and decisions are doing justice to the forces\
  \ of the universe and this is the epitome of all I ever sought.\n\nA few days ago,\
  \ I decided to embark on one purposefully misleading trek to a nearby mountain.\
  \ No phones and torches, meaning no artificial form of light. I intentionally carried\
  \ one matchbox for a feeling of slight carbon warmth when I needed to turn back\
  \ to 'Reality'. I wanted to turn myself in, get in the midst of all the untouched\
  \ nature and lose myself, wishing to stay in the company of the ones who don't move,\
  \ they just breathe and provide us with the necessary elements to breathe. From\
  \ morning to night, just me, the greenery and the gazillions of insects I could\
  \ hear but not see, felt weird you know, I could move freely, hear my own breath,\
  \ see butterflies in a bunch of lustrous color combinations as they would settle\
  \ on my shoulder as I passed. After all, we know \"all is one for one is all\".\
  \ After a stormy summit and a pacy walk back to the base, Darkness struck in, this\
  \ is when I knew the discomfort that I was here for has struck. Gradually we lost\
  \ our way and eventually, we were not even on a trail; we were forcing our way through\
  \ thick bushes. Trust me friends, two hours of wandering with fear tingling within\
  \ me was revealing enough, wondering would I have to stay the night in this beauty\
  \ but beasty land with not one ray of light. Moment by moment, by belief was plummeting.\
  \ Look at me, being all shaken and praying to the powers above. Now even if I touched\
  \ a leaf I'd wonder was it my past bad deeds telling me that they aren't leaving\
  \ or was this nature\u2019s way of guiding me deeper into the discomfort I came\
  \ looking for. Man, I settled for once right where I was, my shivering hands got\
  \ into my pockets and got a match out, I struck it and boom, a groovy vertical wave\
  \ of flame asymmetrically bloomed of the stick with a little extra carbon smoke\
  \ waver into the darkness and I saw my hands on which on a drop of water lay, my\
  \ face's reflection on it. Bamboozled did I look, not one bit of understanding of\
  \ the world on my face, but I saw who I am, even in the darkness. You know what\
  \ my dear friends, I felt something within me, goosebumps crept in and my legs and\
  \ hands twitched, my beard felt rigid and strangely erect. \n\nThat's when I figured\
  \ about oneness again, everything was so contrasting, after such an eventful day\
  \ a simple light of a match made me feel one with the forest, the land and the daily\
  \ life that I left behind for a while, vibes started pouring in all around, rainfall\
  \ struck and I felt safe. Krr-krrr, Choo- Pakiyaaa, Tu-Doo-Do-Do-Do , all life around\
  \ me rose like a Blue Whale, I felt so good and so peaceful and loved existence\
  \ so much then, I believed in \"Tears in Heaven\" and \"Coming back to life\". You\
  \ see once again friends, nothing is hard, you never need to run or stay, you never\
  \ need to explode or implode, the two sides of a coin are a myth, it\u2019s all\
  \ one, there are no two sides, its collectivity everywhere, you-me-him, land-fire-water.\
  \ A broad mind will make you comfortable with my aspect of loving discomfort, which\
  \ makes my whole speech above ideal to read. \n\n-\tShillong, Meghalaya, North-East\
  \ India."
