Text: "I wake up, I sigh and I sink deeper into the cloud like mattress that cocoons\
  \ my well-rested, sun kissed body. I sigh because outside of our villa hostel hut\
  \ a rooster sits by our window and crows COCK-A-DOODLE-DO over and over again waking\
  \ me up earlier than I wanted to be woken up. I roll over and winch in frustration\
  \ at the small lump in my mattress. I walk over to the front desk and turn the corner\
  \ to see the hostel owner jump up from the floor where a make shift bed on the floor\
  \ is left disheveled, yet he smiles and greets me with a warm morning welcome. \
  \ Even though the man puts on a happy front, the bags under his eyes and the way\
  \ his joints appear to ache from sleeping on the floor tell a different story. He\
  \ agrees to an earlier breakfast delivery and he runs to a back room and disappears.\
  \ I walk back to my Villa and snuggle back into bed awaiting the knock on the door\
  \ signaling breakfast is served. I roll over and feel the lump once more, but instead\
  \ of wincing, I smile. The rooster crows again. My boyfriend and I roll our eyes\
  \ in annoyance. The rooster caws again. I roll my eyes again and just as I am the\
  \ hostel worker deliver two plates full of delicious food; the highlight of the\
  \ meal being the freshest hard-boiled eggs I have ever cracked into. The rooster\
  \ caws again as I take my last bite of the best egg I have ever had. I strop my\
  \ eyes from rolling backwards and instead I smile. \n\nMy butt hurts. I get off\
  \ the motorbike and rub my behind because even though we drove a short distance\
  \ from the hostel to the gas station, the consistently placed potholes in the road\
  \ are like little dirt monsters that jump up and kick you directly in the tail bone.\
  \ Don\u2019t get me wrong the sites are beautiful, the motorbike is fun- but wow\
  \ my butt hurts. I hop back on the bike but I whisper one complaint about our method\
  \ of transport to my boyfriend. As we motor into the most remote parts of the island,\
  \ I see fewer and fewer motorbikes on the roads yet I see more and more half built\
  \ homes filled with full families. I pass home after home. I pass local after local\
  \ carrying heavy loads in both arms, some even balancing it on their heads. Even\
  \ though we drive by them fast, I never fail to see the giant day-brightening smile\
  \ that each man and women wear on their faces. I never fail to see the enthusiastic\
  \ wave they greet us with, and I never fail to see the strength not only in their\
  \ bodies but also in their souls. I focus back on the motorbike and on the road.\
  \ We hit another pothole. My butt hurts. Instead of complaining I look up and smile,\
  \ and I continue to smile at each passerby. \n\nWe continue our drive. Leaves from\
  \ a bush whip me in the face. \u201CStupid leaves\u201D I think to myself. The front\
  \ tire of our bike catches loose gravel and we slide out and hit the ground. I feel\
  \ my legs and arms scrap against the rough ground and I feel pebbles dig they into\
  \ my skin. I get up right away I am okay. Surface cuts only. I look back to see\
  \ my boyfriend bleeding from deep cuts on the whole right side of his body. Cuts\
  \ that in the middle of nowhere with no pharmacy around, and no doctors need stiches\
  \ and could easily get infected. Two locals run to our attendance. But instead of\
  \ staying with us they dart into the jungle and come out minutes later, hands full\
  \ of leaves. They crush them up and with water they make a naturally disinfecting\
  \ spread and clean each one of our wounds with it. The leaves work their magic and\
  \ clean our cuts and save us from future infection. I stand up and hit my head on\
  \ a branch full of leaves. I grab the branch and then the leaf and I smile."
