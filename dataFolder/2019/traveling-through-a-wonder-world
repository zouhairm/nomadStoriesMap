Text: "First time in my life I heard the word \u2018Sobat\u2019 that had got the most\
  \ delightful taste we\u2019d ever savored. Sitting in the cozy room of a small house,\
  \ we were only able to stare around like mad as if we were on another planet or\
  \ an utterly different far-flung corner of the world. That area is in the outskirts\
  \ of the main city \u2018Dera Ghazi Khan\u2019 which is located in the Punjab province\
  \ of Pakistan. \nI and my friends were always eager to travel to the Indus River\
  \ for exploring as much beauty as we could. Our exploratory fishing trip was arranged\
  \ for Dera Ghazi Khan which is located on the bank of Indus River. We were all set\
  \ with the stuff required for the short excursion and reached in the late afternoon.\
  \ The twilight cast a purple spell on that scarcely populated area which was enough\
  \ for energizing our bone-tired bodies. We pitched our camp, in the diminishing\
  \ light of compellingly sinking sun, after finding a suitable spot. Despite having\
  \ an idea about the changing weather patterns by the end of winter, we didn\u2019\
  t notice the dusty sky that was going to get us into trouble. The wind started to\
  \ blow quietly and then the strong gusts began to blow through the area. It then\
  \ went wild.\nThe sandstorms are very common in that area especially in summer but\
  \ at the end of winter, they start coming along violently. Even as we started having\
  \ our meal the wind came quietly as if it was going to ease us into that lonely\
  \ place. It grew rougher and then became raging. Our camp was almost blown away\
  \ and the pegs were uprooted by the strong and swift wind that was picking up. Due\
  \ to the masses of sand that the wind brought for us as an added bonus, we had everything\
  \ covered in the blanket of sand.\nWhat we were doing was collecting the scattered\
  \ stuff and finding some safer place. The comparatively better place was the shelter\
  \ of some sparsely grown trees. We took our belongings and went under the thin,\
  \ barely able to be called, a canopy of trees. We were quite relieved seeing that\
  \ the winds had lost the aggression finally, thanks to the kind time that never\
  \ stops and keeps on passing. We were totally disgusted believing that the day was\
  \ really a bad hair day and had thwarted our plan. When the hunger pangs grew stronger\
  \ we started having something to eat. To crown it all, our food was totally gritty-\
  \ the feast that storm had brought for us.\nOwing to the fact that there was no\
  \ population nearby, we had to walk a long distance and then incidentally stumbled\
  \ across some small houses with a pleasant yellow light coming out of the holes\
  \ in the walls. The natives of the area amazed us with everything they had from\
  \ the incredible attitudes to the amazing lifestyles managed with very limited resources.\
  \ The adobe house, where we were the unasked-for guests, had both exterior and interior\
  \ covered with the spic and span, a slightly rough and fine layer of mud. All the\
  \ houses of that area were made up of adobe. In order to keep them neat and tidy,\
  \ women do a hectic job of regularly making the adobe with mud and straw and applying\
  \ them evenly on the walls.\nThe flickering flames of fire lit in a corner in a\
  \ hand-made stove were giving the small room a snug feeling. All of us had bowls\
  \ of the native soup made by the inhabitants of the area and the dish named \u2018\
  Sobat\u2019 for the dinner. This specialty is made by the people of that area as\
  \ their traditional food. It has the pieces of bread soaked into the delectable\
  \ gravy of the tender meat loaded with the conventional spices. Feeling the savor\
  \ of every mouthful, being melted in the mouth, was something out of this world.\
  \ The end of the day was the most heavenly part of the whole trip spent in a small\
  \ yet undeniably awe-inspiring corner of the world."
