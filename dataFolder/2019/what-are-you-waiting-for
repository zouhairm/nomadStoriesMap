Text: "The twenty or so burly men turned towards me, and the lively chatter I\u2019\
  d heard from the outside immediately died when I stepped into the center of their\
  \ den. I suddenly felt extremely conscious of how out of place I was \u2013 a small,\
  \ distinctly Asian girl, innocently wandering around Lisbon alone in the off-peak\
  \ season, a good seven thousand miles from home.\n\nI felt the intensity of their\
  \ gaze as if I were a lamb that had happily walked into a butcher\u2019s shop, thinking\
  \ that it had found shelter. Maybe I\u2019d misread the sign outside. Maybe I\u2019\
  d accidentally trespassed into someone\u2019s home! Either way, it was clear that\
  \ it was a mistake, and that I should leave. The problem was that I would have to\
  \ weave my way back through the rows of closely arranged tables and chairs again,\
  \ making it a very clumsy and awkward exit. Glancing around furtively, I was still\
  \ planning my escape route when I heard a gruff voice beside me.\n\n\u201CWhat are\
  \ you waiting for? Sit down!\u201D he commanded. \n\nIn those few moments of silence,\
  \ the man\u2019s voice was so loud that I was certain the entire restaurant had\
  \ heard it. My face, clearly betraying how I felt, flushed red. The man had salt-and-pepper\
  \ hair and stubble that reminded me of a particularly fierce schoolteacher.\n\n\
  I sat down, as instructed, and squinted at the menu on the wall \u2013 a handwritten\
  \ list on a whiteboard, as cramped as the furniture arrangement of the restaurant.\
  \ With a limited Portuguese vocabulary consisting mainly of \u2018obrigada\u2019\
  \ and \u2018ginja d\u2019Obidos\u2019, it was a code I could not crack. The appetizers\
  \ should be at the top, and the desserts should be at the bottom\u2026 right? \n\
  \nTo think that a few moments ago, I was still standing in front of the open door,\
  \ wondering where the menu was, when a waitress ushered me into the only remaining\
  \ table right in the heart of the restaurant.\n\nThe same man seated barely an arm\u2019\
  s length away turned to me again. \u201CWhat do you want? Eh\u2026 Fish? Chicken?\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CUm\u2026 fish?\u201D I replied hesitantly.\n\nWithout another word,\
  \ he called a lady over, and they started chatting animatedly in Portuguese, gesturing\
  \ in my direction a few times.\n\n\u201COK,\u201D he said to me. \u201CNow you wait.\u201D\
  \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to think. On one hand, I had finally realized that he\
  \ was helping me, and I was grateful. On the other, I couldn\u2019t help but worry\
  \ that he had ordered a feast for me that would empty out my wallet. I waited.\n\
  \nThankfully, just one slightly flattened, lightly charred fish arrived on a steel\
  \ platter, with a side of boiled potatoes and carrots. I gingerly pried off a flaky\
  \ piece of meat with my fork, still unsure of what to expect. Out of the corner\
  \ of my eye, I noticed that the man was watching me.\n\nThe fish was grilled to\
  \ perfection, with just the right amount of salt; tender, with ivory meat that came\
  \ right off the bones. Turning towards the man, I nodded and smiled as I proceeded\
  \ to pick the fish apart. \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s good!\u201D I told him. He seemed\
  \ satisfied.\n\nThen he frowned slightly and called the same lady over again. \n\
  \nThis time, she returned with a small glass bowl filled with a golden, oily liquid.\
  \ I looked at it stupidly. Was I supposed to dip the fish into it, or drink it?\
  \ Was I even supposed to touch it? The man got up, reached over, and promptly doused\
  \ the remains of my fish with the liquid. It was just melted butter. I wiped the\
  \ plate clean in minutes, leaving behind a perfect skeleton.\n\nAs I prepared to\
  \ leave, I noticed that the room was buzzing with conversation again, my intrusion\
  \ long forgotten and forgiven. I thanked the man for his kindness and wished him\
  \ a good day. This time, I noticed that his eyes, wrinkled with fine lines, were\
  \ kind.\n\n\u201CWelcome to Portugal,\u201D he said, smiling."
