Text: "I crossed into Germany at 3AM, startled awake by border control agents on my\
  \ tour bus. They questioned why I was going to Prague - our final destination -\
  \ and in my nervous state I answered \u201Ctourism.\u201D I cringed as I blurted\
  \ the words out. The storied past of Prague had remained a murky spot in my understanding\
  \ of the world thus far, and I was eager to remedy that in the way any honest traveler\
  \ does: by finding out for myself. \n\nThe Czech Republic\u2019s history is complicated\
  \ and chaotic, but also widely unknown by many in the world. They were used like\
  \ a pawn throughout World War II, then suffered under Communist Rule before nationwide\
  \ revolt. This history gave me the impression of a resilient society, maybe a little\
  \ cold to the outside world after all they\u2019d had to suffer on their own. My\
  \ own experiences with Czechs were black and white, either warmth or total contempt.\
  \ It seemed while the country was traded back and forth by other nations, the people\
  \ remained divided in their perception of outsiders.\n\nFrom our hilarious tour\
  \ guide, Givvy, to a thrift store owner who went so far out of her way to direct\
  \ us to her newly-located shop, I knew the Czechs were kind people. But then came\
  \ the ticket attendant at the castle who made my friend cry after refusing her student\
  \ visa for a discounted rate, and the curt service in restaurants which led me to\
  \ believe the locals had grown tired of yet another group of loud Americans. I often\
  \ felt like I should apologize for my nationality, a feeling I would grow accustomed\
  \ to in other cities across Europe in the time of Trump and increasing polarization.\
  \ \n\nIn the end, the good far outweighed the bad. There was the waiter who gave\
  \ us free shots of traditional Czech liquor. He also split the bill for us (an anomaly\
  \ in Europe) and let us use card (again, anomaly). There was even the Starbucks\
  \ worker who gave us the bathroom code before we purchased anything, telling us\
  \ in a hushed tone as if he was sharing the secret to life itself.\n\nThe best moments\
  \ of our short weekend in Prague were the ones spent exploring on our own. We wandered\
  \ back streets, perused Shakespeare & Sons English Bookstore, and were amused by\
  \ crazy street performers before meandering back across St. Charles\u2019s Bridge\
  \ just as the sun was setting over the Vltava River. Throughout it all, I absorbed\
  \ the history of Prague as much my body absorbed chills while Givvy explained to\
  \ us Hitler\u2019s wish to turn the Jewish Quarter into a museum of an extinct race.\
  \ The thought was profoundly disturbing, but the result is a beautifully preserved\
  \ neighborhood. It is now a permanent bookmark of history after surviving a destructive\
  \ war and an evil dictator\u2019s ambitious plans. \n\nWe were further inspired\
  \ by the words of many on the John Lennon Wall, taking photos not only so that we\
  \ could share on Instagram, but so that we would remember the wisdom and hopes of\
  \ those before us. Bold phrases on the famous wall, such as \u201Cdo not lie to\
  \ yourself,\u201D forced me to confront my own past in the present context. Prague\
  \ has emerged time and again from the bloody rubble of terrible misfortunes, and\
  \ as a city they knowingly indulge in all of the world\u2019s vices. Its bad reputation\
  \ suits its dark architecture and shady past, but like a phoenix rising from ash\
  \ it won\u2019t be erased from history. Its resilience made me acknowledge that\
  \ whatever my past may be, I can rise above it. Haunting beauty is visible on every\
  \ corner, just as it exists in the pages of my personal history. \n\nUpon reflection,\
  \ maybe it was really this aspect of Prague that made it special to me. Not the\
  \ castle or the cheap beer, but the diverse people who all came to the same place\
  \ from different walks of life, willing to share their stories in this complicated\
  \ setting. It may be a city of sin, but once I looked closer it was easy to see\
  \ beauty seeping through the cracks."
