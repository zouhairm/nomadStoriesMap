Text: "During an internship in a hydroeletric building field located in south-west\
  \ of Parana State in Brazil, I used to live far from urban area because of my work.\
  \ When I left that company, in beginning of June 2018, I had to pass by Foz do Igua\xE7\
  u city, in order to take a flight home. As it was holiday in Brazil, I chose to\
  \ spend my last days there. Actually, I decided to stay in Puerto Iguazu, city located\
  \ in Argentina, bordering the city of Foz do Igua\xE7u, Brazil. \t\nThen, I got\
  \ the chance to visit three border cities and countries at once: Foz do Igua\xE7\
  u (Brazil), Puerto Iguazu (Argentina) and Ciudad del Este (Paraguay). I strongly\
  \ recommend this type of trips not because you can brag about quantity of places\
  \ you have gone, but because the mix of cultures and differences observed in areas\
  \ so close to each other. \nAs an ordinary student, I didn\u2019t have enough money\
  \ to do all the things I wanted. I tried to pick the most interesting sights of\
  \ those cities by myself, following a tourist guidebook. In my room, I met a Colombian\
  \ girl who joined me. She had lived in capital of Argentina for a long time, then\
  \ we exchange some ideas about attractions, preferably open to the public (I mean:\
  \ free!) and we did most of them together. \nImagine what a great couple formation:\
  \ my new friend is an architect, and I, by that time, was a civil engineering student.\
  \ Our opinions were combined into wishes to explore everything related to constructions\
  \ and buildings. We went to remote villages and neighborhoods. We met local people\
  \ in marketplaces and fairs. We found a store with her name. We visited different\
  \ churches, squares, parks and restaurants, including a Mexican one. In Puerto Iguazu,\
  \ she showed me the Chorizo steak, a classic of Argentine steakhouses; and of course,\
  \ the Empanadas. Also, we enjoyed the food trucks in the surrounding areas where\
  \ she could try some of Brazilian snacks in order to bring her to our culture as\
  \ well. In Paraguay, we went shopping, what a surprise! Ciudad del Este is, in fact,\
  \ very cheap to shopping, but it is so busy and crowded, and traffic is literally\
  \ crazy. Sellers there talk in different languages, and they are very communicative\
  \ by the way. We met a boy at a store who invited us to visit a small bar recently\
  \ opened. It was perfect, since we had one more night there and we hadn\u2019t going\
  \ out at night yet. For me, one of the most interesting things I have noticed in\
  \ buildings in Argentina was the walls paintings, so colorful, and rich of life,\
  \ most of them with fun drawings or something related to the city history. On the\
  \ other hand, Foz do Igua\xE7u has a lot of expensive attractions, most of them\
  \ for entertaining. Besides the Iguazu Falls, what, in fact, plays the title as\
  \ one of the seven natural wonders of the world, there are some very interesting\
  \ places usually unnoticed by tourists. The Chen Tien Buddhist Temple is one example.\
  \ It is the second largest Buddhist temple in Latin America. The temple gathers\
  \ peace and oriental culture in beautiful gardens and escapes the traditional tourism\
  \ routes in Foz do Igua\xE7u. Also, Omar Ibn Al-Khatab Mosque is unique and shows\
  \ a lot about Arabic culture in one neighborhood. And I can\u2019t finish without\
  \ talking about the Itaipu Dam, a hydroelectric dam on the Paran\xE1 River located\
  \ on the border between Brazil and Paraguay. It is the largest in the world in electricity\
  \ generation, and as an engineer I have to say: what a work in engineering history.\n\
  Besides the experiences I have made, what I can take from this trip is what I have\
  \ learned. During the walks with my new friend, we talked about many topics, from\
  \ religions, politician issues, food, art and, even human behavior in our countries.\
  \ For me, the trip would be worth it if I only had met that person and I had known\
  \ the story behind her. Because it is not about the destination, it is about the\
  \ journey."
