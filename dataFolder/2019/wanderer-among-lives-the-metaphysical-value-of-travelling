Text: "\u201CLife isn\u2019t obvious. We should give up trying to understand it and\
  \ just accept it. It\u2019s undeniably easier,\u201D he said with his thin, trembling,\
  \ lips. But certain people never know when to give up, and in one way or another\
  \ they come back home, even if just for a brief moment. \n\nSuch a hot day, the\
  \ earlier rain had left that good smell of wet grass. It was my eighteenth birthday,\
  \ which I was celebrating with my family. Family, what is it really? There was no\
  \ way I would ever have envisaged the journey that was awaiting me; a journey that\
  \ would make me question the meaning of \u201Cfamily\u201D itself; deny my certainty.\
  \ Twenty days later, in fact, I was on my way to Belgium as an exchange student.\
  \ I would live for three months in the Flemish countryside, trying to be accepted\
  \ by others, like in a sort of unusual, cynical social experiment. By the time I\
  \ arrived there, I felt judging eyes on me, but I know it must have been difficult\
  \ for them to accept my sudden arrival. However, things started to get better: I\
  \ was finally a member of their community. \n\n\u2026 \u201CI can still remember\
  \ his happiness about his life\u2026why can\u2019t I. With such fortitude, he would\
  \ have been able to do everything he wanted. He was studying in a musical academy.\
  \ He loved music.\u201D \u2026\n\nAs people got wind of my imminent homecoming,\
  \ I was invited by an elderly couple to have a tea with them and other people from\
  \ the neighbourhood. I was confused and surprised at that. I accepted. When I stepped\
  \ into their house, I was struck by a strange feeling. My sense of smell became\
  \ sharper. It was like everything in there could exude a fragrance and tell me a\
  \ story. It was the smell of a fully lived life, the typical smell that you would\
  \ expect to find in an explorer\u2019s or treasure hunter\u2019s house. The walls\
  \ were entirely decorated with all sorts of things from all over the world. My eyes\
  \ spotted a dusty Egyptian Ankh, which must have been very old. The lights in the\
  \ room were soft. The dark atmosphere in there seemed to give a forgotten ancient\
  \ power to the little Egyptian cross, hanging on the wall by a rusty nail. \u201C\
  This place is holding a secret,\u201D I thought while staring at a tiny ivory alligator.\n\
  \n I sat on a wicker chair and started to talk to the house owner. He was an old\
  \ man, who was not afraid of the passage of time. He had been the president of a\
  \ Charity Association, operating in poorer countries, which explained well the multitude\
  \ of crazy stuff in the house. I interrupted the conversation since I wanted to\
  \ help his troubled-looking wife with the tea. In her blue eyes I saw the sweetness\
  \ that only a lovely mother could have. At the end of that evening full of memories\
  \ of adventures, an old portrait caught my attention: a happy and fancily dressed\
  \ young man with long blond hair, beautiful like the sun. I asked the old man about\
  \ him. It was a blow to his heart. \n\n\u201CI was awakened in the middle of the\
  \ night by the police sirens\u201D he said, while a burning tear drifted down his\
  \ face. \n\nThey had had a son, who had died at eighteen. He had died in a car accident\
  \ with another boy, who had come out of it surprisingly unhurt. He had been driving\
  \ fast, like his urge for making the most out of everything: immediately and fast.\
  \ But that time he had lost his game with life, and more than fifty years later\
  \ he was still silently alive in his parents buried pain. That evening he was with\
  \ me, or I was he: a hopeless wanderer who had finally found his way back home after\
  \ a lifetime journey. That evening, in fact, I was for them the son that they knew\
  \ they would soon lose, but in some way they didn\u2019t want to let him go once\
  \ more.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re always welcome here; please come back if you want.\u201D\
  \n\nSomehow, I knew I would never see them again."
