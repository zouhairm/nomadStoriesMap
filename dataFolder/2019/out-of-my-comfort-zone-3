Text: "Routine. Sometimes you get stuck in it. Sometimes you need it and sometimes\
  \ you crave it. I was stuck and I needed out. \nI booked a trip with my roommate\
  \ because she too felt the same as me, thankfully, because I wasn\u2019t brave enough\
  \ to travel alone. We landed in Paris with eyes bigger than our stomachs stopping\
  \ at cafe after cafe to try out the fresh croissants. We couldn\u2019t help it.\
  \ Everywhere my eyes looked my film camera followed to capture. \n\nThat was 2 years\
  \ ago. I\u2019m craving the same feeling again. \n\nWriting and traveling make me\
  \ feel free. I want to take my film camera and my notebook and sit, think, and write.\
  \ A desk job is hard for someone who falls into routine and can\u2019t get out.\
  \ When I was young I wanted to be a photo journalist, I wanted to travel with a\
  \ book and pen in one hand and a camera in the other. Snapping photos and captioning\
  \ them immediately. I wanted to tell stories. At age 23 I have now been working\
  \ in Marketing and Social Media for 2 years since graduating university. I think\
  \ this experience would be exactly what I need to break out of my routine. \n\n\
  And, who knows what will happen this time when I come home."
