Text: "\"That asshole created the most selfish story I've ever seen\" complained our\
  \ guide Chris. The fact that we were about to board a flight to Pyongyang still\
  \ hadn't quite sunk in, but our guide was angry about the documentary \"DPRK: Land\
  \ of Whispers\" that had nearly destroyed the company. Another visitor on this tour\
  \ had filmed it earlier in the year and Chris would never forgive him. He explained\
  \ his close, personal relationships with the Korean government guides, and the heart-to-hear\
  \ conversations he had had to undo the damage caused by that documentary.\nThe fact\
  \ that we were going to North Korea sank in when we saw the Koryo Air plane waiting\
  \ for us with a big North Korean flag painted on the tail fin. While Koryo Air is\
  \ rated by Skytrax as the worst airline in the world, I quickly realized that ultimately,\
  \ this was just another airline. About two hours later we landed in Pyongyang- seeing\
  \ this mythologized, demonized land in front of me was surreal, but what was even\
  \ more surreal was the genuine warmth that our guide greeted his Korean counterparts\
  \ with. They really were \"friends from work\", not the nasty \"government minders\"\
  \ we saw in documentaries. Was this for real?\nOver the next ten days, it became\
  \ clear that it was. After a few cigarettes with our driver and our guide Mr. Kim,\
  \ I started to genuinely enjoy their company. It was true that our guides worked\
  \ for the Korean government and that we were not allowed to wander wherever we wanted-\
  \ but we knew that damn well when we signed up for this trip. \nNobody in our group\
  \ actually spoke Korean, and much of the interaction we had with people there was\
  \ non-verbal. Some of it was through the window of our Korea International Travel\
  \ Company (KITC) bus. In village after village, as we drove through the countryside,\
  \ our bus caught the attention of many small groups of people whose chatting by\
  \ the side of the road, whose conversation had been interrupted by our passing through.\
  \ Some of them looked puzzled- and who wouldn't be?- but many of them suddenly burst\
  \ into smiles and waved at us. I always made sure to smile and wave back. These\
  \ people had families and day-to-day concerns just like us. They were hardly the\
  \ robots our media had portrayed them as. \nI felt the same way watching commuters\
  \ on the Pyongyang metro trying to get to work on time, the students working hard\
  \ to learn English in a country that is largely cut off from the rest of the world,\
  \ the waiters and waitresses in the restaurants doing their jobs, the schoolchildren\
  \ on field trips who are probably glad to get out of the classroom for a few hours\
  \ just like we were at that age. I saw it in the smiles of the soldiers at the border\
  \ with the south who need a cigarette break too- and who enjoyed American Spirits\
  \ very much. \nOur circuit around the country began and ended in Pyongyang, and\
  \ one of the last nights was spent at a theme park there. Quite a few uniformed\
  \ soldiers were there in attendance- and one of them happened to be next to me on\
  \ a roller coaster. Yet another soldier and I bumped into each other on the bumper\
  \ car floor- these soldiers, who I had been taught to view as enemies my whole life,\
  \ were suddenly laughing with me. \n at the Mass Games. One cannot help but feel\
  \ awed at this preposterous show, full of synchronized cards on the other side of\
  \ one of the world's largest stadiums. Acrobats, fireworks and martial arts made\
  \ it feel like several circuses and several years of superbowl halftime shows being\
  \ compressed into about ninety minutes (not that one keeps track of time there).\
  \ For me, though, the most beautiful part of it was seeing not a few people but\
  \ a small crowd waving at our bus. \nAs we got ready to depart, we hugged our guides\
  \ goodbye. I had learned that laughter and a little nicotine can transcend just\
  \ about any political or language barrier."
