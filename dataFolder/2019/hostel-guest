Text: "I moved to Los Angeles about 4 years ago after spending my entire life in the\
  \ San Francisco Bay Area.  So I traveled just around 300 miles down the 5 freeway\
  \ through the heartland of California.  Now this is where it gets interesting. \
  \ Having no plan, around $5,000 dollars in Savings and no job or place to stay I\
  \ found myself bunking at an AirBnB in South Central Los Angeles paying rent every\
  \ night until I realized you can pay for up to two weeks or even a month if you\
  \ wished to stay that long.  I did not know that this was not just an affordable\
  \ option for travelers who desired to see the ocean, Hollywood sign or go to Coachella.\
  \  But it was also home to a Work Away program for individuals primarily fresh out\
  \ college ones from countries all across the world.  Now having just moved I didn't\
  \ realize this and was now on the pursuit for work and a more long-term place to\
  \ live that required a security deposit and lease agreement.  \n\nNow I did eventually\
  \ find a job in the temp world, working primarily as an assistant in downtown Los\
  \ Angeles atop those beautiful skyscrapers overlooking the 101 freeway.  Having\
  \ to for the most part work paycheck to paycheck the idea of throwing down a huge\
  \ deposit for an expensive bank-breaking studio in Los Angeles, I elected to stay\
  \ atop these very flimsy bunk beds with at least 4 people in a room, sharing one\
  \ bathroom, sometimes more because we often had to move to accommodate guests during\
  \ the Summer time.\n\nTo continue, now that I have settled into the chaotic and\
  \ not quite safe housing environment with people I hardly knew.  Here is where the\
  \ travelers, musicians, actors and drifters come to play.  I will begin with the\
  \ drifters who had almost no options who were often forced to leave due to lack\
  \ of rent, domestic and drug abuse, and confrontations with other guests.  But the\
  \ travelers and other actors and musicians is where the entertaining and trans-formative\
  \ aspect comes into play.\n\nNow due to my epileptic condition, the idea of working\
  \ my way around the world I know will never come but I getting to reside with all\
  \ of these young travelers almost gave me that same experience.  Here is where I\
  \ will tell some of the stories, I wish I could tell them all but there is not nearly\
  \ enough room to tell every extraordinary traveling person's story.\n\nThe first\
  \ one I think may have been the most important.  He actually was a Dad dropping\
  \ his son off at USC who was a Freshman.  I've always rather listened to others,\
  \ because I never really got to live the kind of life I always wanted with the exception\
  \ of commuting to and from college studying what turned out to be the perfect major\
  \ for travelers History.  Getting to hear this father who was a very accomplished\
  \ doctor talk about how proud he was of his son and how scared he was for him out\
  \ in the real world took me back to the students I met while in college.  I would\
  \ listened and give him reassuring feedback and after a few days learning about\
  \ him and his Dad, he said to sum it up, \"Phil I wish I could help you out and\
  \ find a job that could provide you with the amount of medicine needed to travel\
  \ and that it was such an honor to share a cheap bunk with you this weekend.\n\n\
  The second one will be a compilation from all the travelers.  Travelers from every\
  \ part of Europe, Central and South America, Australia, Russia, the Midwest and\
  \ East Coast of the United States and one who served on the border of South and\
  \ North Korea.  Together learning their language, making them feel at home despite\
  \ how far they were and sharing various ideas about the world made my experience\
  \ absolutely amazing!\n\nThere is more I'd like to share but I believe that sums\
  \ it up.  Life for a millennial is about experience because we have no money.  But\
  \ every time I said goodbye was both hard but incredible!"
