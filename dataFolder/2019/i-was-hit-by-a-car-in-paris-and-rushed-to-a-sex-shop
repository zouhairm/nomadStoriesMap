Text: "The year was 2008 and I had made a monumental mistake. I was getting ready\
  \ to embark on an overseas trip with a group of guy friends. One I had been planning\
  \ for years. This would be our great celebration, our rite of passage. Four men\
  \ against the world. We could be as free as birds, savouring all of the sensations\
  \ of Europe. How was this a mistake? Well, with a month to go before this trip,\
  \ I had just met a girl. And she was staying behind.\n\nHave you ever done this\
  \ before? Travelling without a partner, knowing full well of the challenges which\
  \ were about to lay ahead? Will the long distance last? Can you even trust yourself\
  \ to stand up against all temptations of an overseas holiday with an arm extended\
  \ forward, telling exotic blessings to stand back and not approach you in this moment\
  \ of long distance confusion?\n\nI knew I had to somehow do this two month journey,\
  \ while doing the balancing act of both staying faithful and also being free enough\
  \ to experience the holiday to the fullest. But how would I do this?\n\nI believed\
  \ I had come up with the solution.....\n\nAnd here is an example of how it went\
  \ down... In Paris my friends and I went out on a pub crawl. And I got drunk. Too\
  \ drunk.\n\nSoon I had lost all of my friends and I was crossing a massive road,\
  \ God knows where in Paris. And boom it happened. I was hit by a car and slammed\
  \ to the bitumen. \n\nI don\u2019t know if it was simply because I was so drunk,\
  \ but I actually didn\u2019t feel that hurt. Sure my pants were ripped around my\
  \ knee, I may have had a few cuts and stuff. But I was surprisingly feeling pretty\
  \ good.\n\nThe men got out of the car in a panic, \u201CAre you alright, are you\
  \ alright?!\u201D\n\nMy response: \u201CI am fine, just take me to a sex shop!\u201D\
  \n\nI know that sounds like a crazy thing to say after just getting hit by a car.\
  \ But this was my saviour \u2013 porn movies. Instead of cheating, after a night\
  \ out, I planned that I could just go back the hostel and watch a DVD on my laptop.\
  \ My roommates were going to still be out partying and I would be home alone, a\
  \ perfect crime.\n\nFunnily enough, the men in the car felt so bad about hitting\
  \ me that they agreed to my strange request.\n\nI instructed them to take me to\
  \ a sex shop I saw earlier in my daytime wanderings, near the Moulin Rouge. And\
  \ off we drove into the sunset.\n\nOn this journey, however, all of a sudden I noticed\
  \ in the rear view mirror that the two guys in the backseat were making out. Hmm\
  \ that\u2019s interesting. And then the driver started rubbing my leg. He had noticed\
  \ the ripped part of my pants and was asking \u201CAre you alright?\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ gravity of the situation dawned on me. Here I was in Paris, a city I didn\u2019\
  t know at all. I could have been getting driven around in circles for all I knew.\
  \ Meanwhile I was also super drunk and in no position to protect myself from a car\
  \ full of strangers, one of which was currently rubbing my leg.\n\nAnd yeah it wasn\u2019\
  t just a bit of a rub, he was definitely going beyond the call of duty.\n\nWhat\
  \ to do, what to do.\n\nI let the bastard touch my leg. But I didn\u2019t let him\
  \ get carried away. Give him hope, I thought to myself. Don\u2019t let on that you\
  \ are zero percent gay, not that there is anything wrong with that. Get your sex\
  \ video and get the hell out of there.\n\nWe arrived at the sex shop. They weren\u2019\
  t driving me around in circles after all. And I got my sex video.\n\nAnd this can\
  \ only be 700 words, let\u2019s wrap this up here\u2026 I learnt something I didn't\
  \ expect - Parisian people are trustworthy, even though they will run you over and\
  \ try to make out with you."
