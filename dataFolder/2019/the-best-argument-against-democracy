Text: "Two stocky older men in dark suits are leaning in for a kiss. The square-jawed\
  \ brunette\u2019s hand clasps the blonde\u2019s ample neck, drawing him towards\
  \ pursed lips. From a distance, the two giant painted figures evoke a communist\
  \ propaganda poster, all sunlit facial angles and beatific gazes; they could be\
  \ lovers, but they could just as easily be rivals for the Soviet premiership, pulled\
  \ close for a manly socialist greeting. \n\nAs our supersized beast of a car speeds\
  \ along the highway (note: all American cars feel supersized to Australians), I\
  \ realise I\u2019ve got the wrong end of the political spectrum. The billboard lovers\
  \ are not socialists. They\u2019re the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, and his\
  \ vanquished presidential rival, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas; which is funny, because\
  \ at this moment in history you would struggle to find two men less inclined to\
  \ make out with one another anywhere in the United States. The slogan perfects it:\
  \ \u2018Love Trumps Hate. End Homophobia\u2019. I giggle. \n\nThe sign also reads\
  \ \u2018Paid for by Planting Peace\u2019. It clearly isn\u2019t pacifying Jeff,\
  \ my all-American Uber driver, who shakes his baseball-capped head mournfully: \u201C\
  fuckin\u2019 convention\u201D. I mention I\u2019m excited to see the Democrats anoint\
  \ their first female nominee next week. Jeff explains, as one would to a child,\
  \ that he has it on good authority the Clintons have had dozens of people murdered\
  \ on their climb to the top. Do I have Facebook? He can send me some articles about\
  \ it. \n\nI remain studiously uncommitted on the Facebook issue as Lake Erie slides\
  \ into view. It\u2019s an inland sea for all practical purposes, covering an area\
  \ the size of New Hampshire, which gives the conga line of glassy skyscrapers along\
  \ the Cleveland shoreline an edge-of-the-world feel, like you might take a wrong\
  \ turn at the downtown Hilton and fall off the map. \n\nThese are certainly strange\
  \ times. The Republican Convention is the high water mark of a tense summer; the\
  \ city is concerned about violent protests on both sides, and taking no chances.\
  \ It wide Midwestern avenues are teeming with police in freshly-minted riot gear,\
  \ like several thousand toy Avengers dipped in black paint. Journalists are packing\
  \ gas masks and taking training from retired British commandos. Remarkably unconcerned,\
  \ Jeff drops me off near the Quicken Loans Arena - just a few blocks of security\
  \ barriers, barbeque restaurants and \u2018Hillary sucks, but not like Monica\u2019\
  \ T-shirt stalls away from the action. He asks me to please leave him a five-star\
  \ review, and roars off. \n\nAnd so it begins. The violence doesn\u2019t materialise;\
  \ the media are starved of conflict. One day, I encounter two opposing protestors\
  \ in a mild shouting match. They\u2019re immediately enveloped by fifty hungry zoom\
  \ lenses in a swarm formation, like a hedgehog turned in on itself. One enterprising\
  \ photographer is even crouched between the men\u2019s legs, being yelled at by\
  \ the other forty-nine for ruining their shots. The confused protestors scatter\
  \ quickly. \n\nBut I\u2019m not here for those diehard partisans; I\u2019m just\
  \ hoping for some sensible conversations with salt-of-the-earth swing state voters\
  \ to restore my confidence in American democracy. Unfortunately as the week goes\
  \ on, these interactions keep going awry; Jeff turns out to be more omen than outlier.\
  \ A yoga mom in the ladies room tells me about Obamacare death panels. The bartender\
  \ knows for sure Goldman Sachs is a global Zionist plot. Of course, no one predicts\
  \ that Russian operatives will hack the election using Facebook, because that\u2019\
  s ridiculous, but the conspiracy theories keep piling up. The whole experience is\
  \ unsettling, like walking through your home in the dark and falling through a trapdoor.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019m close to giving up when I meet a wholesome older couple visiting\
  \ for a medical conference. Dan\u2019s a doctor, Amy\u2019s a teacher. They\u2019\
  re from Iowa. We get drinks, and ask about each other\u2019s families. They feel\
  \ so normal. It\u2019s going well. But then we\u2019re discussing their daughter\u2019\
  s upcoming trip to Europe and the other shoe drops, hard. Amy sips her beer, and\
  \ sighs: \u201Cbut of course, the Antichrist will emerge from the European Union\u201D\
  . \n\nThe next day, I scour the Greyhound terminal until I get what I need - a ticket\
  \ out of Cleveland, and an Australian travelling companion."
