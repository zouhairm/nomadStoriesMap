  of America and we both also agree that American people have an better life than
  we people do usually American school age has an totally plan for next platform and
  we Indian people don't have an any idea what's the next step in our life so we decided
  to watch some movies of America than we decided to watch one of the bestest movie
  in my life it's American pie than we started for each other interested in our experience
  getting in for and we founded our life's greatest mission is that "we had love in
  our life than sex is an automatically generated but if we love each other than our
  problems are too small for solve." So our life story started here with this great

  is "life is too short bro we had to live the life with our loved people." Thank
  you so much guys for listing my story. We love you people.
