Text: "Nowadays, many countries are trying their best to develop their tourism sector,\
  \ including my country, Indonesia. I really hope that I can contribute to advancing\
  \ my country's tourism sector. Actually, tourist destination in Indonesia is not\
  \ only Bali, but many areas are also good.\n\nI really enjoy tourism activities\
  \ and want to be a world explorer. South Korea is one of the countries I want to\
  \ visit. I want to sharpen my language skills and want to know how they develop\
  \ their tourism. So, In 2018 I ventured to do solo travel to South Korea for 18\
  \ days, from September 29 to October 16.\n\nMaybe everybody knew that South Korea\
  \ is a modern and beautiful country. But, many people still curious and asked me\
  \ how actually the Korean people are? From my experience, the Korean people are\
  \ very friendly and polite, they also like to help others. Isn't spirit of hospitality\
  \ one of the important factors in tourism? That is about the friendliness and good\
  \ service provided to tourists.\n\nSolo travelling was a new challenge for me. At\
  \ that time, on September 29, 2018 around 9  AM KST, I arrived in Incheon Airport\
  \ and took a airport bus to Seoul. Korea at that time was in autumn season, the\
  \ trees began to change colour and the temperature was 11\xB0c, which was quite\
  \ cold for me because in my tropical country never been that cold. \n\nWhen I got\
  \ off from the bus, I realised that I got off at the wrong bus stop. When I was\
  \ looking for my guesthouse, it was the most memorable time for me because I got\
  \ lost  and made me walk for many hours around the Namdaemun area. Of course, I\
  \ had brought a printed map and Korean map app with me.\n\nThe guesthouse that I\
  \ booked was in a remote alley in the Namdaemun area. With my limited Korean language\
  \ skills, I asked directions to many local people, some people didn't know the direction\
  \ and the busy policeman suggested me to take a taxi. When I saw the digital map,\
  \ I was confused inside the crowded Namdaemun Market and repeatedly walking on the\
  \ same street. I was at the point when I felt, \u2018When will I succeed in finding\
  \ that place?\u2019 Then suddenly Korean old man came to approached me, then I found\
  \ out that he was a watch seller in there. He asked me in English, \u201CWhere are\
  \ you going?\u201D Then I answer it in Korean language that I was searching for\
  \ my guesthouse and showed the map and address to him, he and his friends said that\
  \ my guesthouse was still far away and showed me the way as much as they could.\
  \ They hoped that I could quickly find that place and told me to always be careful.\n\
  \nMy lightweight luggage became heavy because I carried it for a long time. Then\
  \ as I walked, there was a pick-up car driver called me and told me that my jacket\
  \ was fell from my shoulder and dragged by my own luggage. He helped me get the\
  \ jacket and cleaned it for me. After that, I asked him the direction to the guesthouse,\
  \ he said that the place I was looking for was across the street. Finally, for almost\
  \ 3 hours I arrived at my guesthouse. The owner of the guesthouse also very friendly.\
  \ He knew that I was studying Korea language so he talked to me a lot.\n\nI also\
  \ found other experiences about Korean hospitality when I was shopping. When I wanted\
  \ to try wearing shoes, the shopkeeper helped me to put the shoes on my feet. If\
  \ I wanted to try a jacket, they also helped me to wear it.\n\nWhile in Korea, I\
  \ occasionally tried to talk with Korean people to sharpen my Korean language skills.\
  \ I even got some new Korean friends and we are still in touch until right now.\n\
  \nI\u2019m grateful that I had a lot of good memories in South Korea. Even though\
  \ human are created with many differences, we are still a social beings who cannot\
  \ live alone. Travelling really taught me many things, including how the hospitality\
  \ is become an important thing in tourism."
