Text: "I have not been out of South Africa. Even though my goal is travel the world.\
  \ We had planned a trip to travel to the Transkie in the province of the Eastern\
  \ Cape\n This is the southern part of South Africa.\nPort at Johns was our destination.\
  \ We left \nCape town around 19:00 hours. This was a car drive trip. Along the way\
  \ towards Gorge there are small farming communities, and those towns have now grown\
  \ and are slightly developed. \nWe drove almost 4hours before we got to a place\
  \ of refreshments.\nWe took a break and relaxed as we still had a long way to drive,\
  \ and our next town was Knaysna. We started out journey again and this time the\
  \ roads were so nice and tranquil. \nWith the beautiful music in the car kids sleeping\
  \ and myself singing along my husband driving. This!!was a dream come true for all\
  \ of us. We drove passing the most beautiful route by the sea, though at this point\
  \ we could not see the sea  as it was dark.\nIn the early hours of the morning we\
  \ were in the Eastern Cape, Port Elizabeth to be precise. At this point we still\
  \ had 3hours to reach our destination.\nExiety was bugining to set in. Finally we\
  \ arrived in Port st Johns. And I tell you the view and fresh air that receives\
  \ you when you drive in, tells you..\"it was all worth it\"\n\nWe had planned a\
  \ camp cite  closer to the light house. This place is amazing unspoiled by any human\
  \ develpments. The environment has been saved, monkies roam freely. The evenings\
  \ are amazing. The stars looked like our ceiling, that's how close they appear.\
  \ We slept in that beautiful place with the sound of the ocean hitting the rocks\
  \ rite beneath us.\nThis trip was amazing. I am looking forward to the next one."
