Text: "Albania is a mix of remarkable natural beauty, deep history, tempting food,\
  \ and some of the nicest people you\u2019ll meet anywhere. It\u2019s like Italy\
  \ with limited public transportation and the French Riviera with more partially-constructed\
  \ buildings and less attitude. Albania is like its neighbor to the south, Greece,\
  \ but with far fewer tourists and a whole lot of Cold War bunkers. In a lot of ways,\
  \ it\u2019s probably like other parts of Europe were 30 or 40 years ago, which gives\
  \ it a feeling all its own. You won\u2019t find a McDonald\u2019s or Starbucks here.\
  \ And, yes, it is cheap. And safe. \n\n\nGjirokastra\nOne of Albania\u2019s UNESCO\
  \ World Heritage Sites, the town of Gjirokastra is situated in the Drinos river\
  \ valley in southern Albania. Wherever I looked around the stunning landscape, there\
  \ were unique buildings coat the hillsides. From the town\u2019s 13th century castle\
  \ to its slate-roofed houses, the effect is nothing short of magical, especially\
  \ at sunset.\n\n\n\nKsamil\n\nWhen I decided to visit Ksamil, I had absolutely no\
  \ idea what to expect. I had heard a few sound bites about bad roads and transportation\
  \ challenges and a few vague assertions that it was an inexpensive place to visit\
  \ \u2013 nothing to help me form any good ideas about what I would be experiencing.\
  \ Part of the Albanian Riviera, Ksamil echoes some of the best parts of Europe.\
  \ Ksamil is a dream. Turquoise water, fresh seafood, hospitality beyond compare\u2026\
  and all at an absurdly affordable price. It has the seas of the South of France,\
  \ the beaches of the Italian Riviera, and the food of the Mediterranean, minus the\
  \ people. Lying on the beach all day isn\u2019t really my style, so I rent a boat\
  \ to visit the three nearby islands. An hour in the boat \u2013 plus a captain to\
  \ drive me \u2013 was only $30. \n\n\n\n\n\nButrint\nSome of the history of this\
  \ little-known country mirrors that of the rest of the region \u2013 it\u2019s Greek\
  \ and Roman. My first historical stop on my trip to Albania was Butrint, a UNESCO\
  \ World Heritage Site less than 10 minutes from Ksamil. Unlike many ruins, Butrint\
  \ hasn\u2019t been overrun by a modern city. Instead, it has been mostly undisturbed.\
  \ It is also bordered by hills and a lake, making it a unique combination of nature\
  \ and an archaeological park. A colony since prehistoric times, Butrint (then known\
  \ as Buthrotum) was controlled by Greeks until the Romans took over in the 1st century\
  \ BC. By the 5th century AD, it was an early Christian center. It was then briefly\
  \ occupied by the Venetians before being abandoned in the Middle Ages. Remarkably,\
  \ evidence of each civilization is still clear as you walk around the massive site."
