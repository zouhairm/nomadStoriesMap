Text: "New York is a city of bright lights, busy streets, and tourist draws. Underneath\
  \ all this, however, there is a city that over eight million people call home. It\
  \ is these people who know the city better than any tour company and who have carved\
  \ out their own traditions in one of the most visited cities in the world. On my\
  \ most recent trip to New York, this past October, I was lucky enough to witness\
  \ some of these traditions for myself, and it has allowed me to see the \u201CBig\
  \ Apple\u201D in a new way.\n\nFor some background \u2013 it is important to know\
  \ that my mother and I decided in 2017 to take a yearly trip to New York for our\
  \ birthdays. Since this decision, we have completed our trip twice, visiting new\
  \ museums and seeing new shows each time. This year\u2019s choices were the Mean\
  \ Girls musical, and the American Museum of Natural History. It was also the first\
  \ time I had ever been to Queens, the first time we had ever taken a bus into the\
  \ city, and the first time we had ever been in New York for Halloween.\n\nWhile\
  \ it may seem obvious that every city will have a community, it is a fact that can\
  \ be forgotten when you are in a metropolis \u2013 especially one that is so frequently\
  \ featured in popular media. To be honest, it is New York\u2019s presence in pop\
  \ culture, along with its historic and theatre attractions, that has affected my\
  \ family\u2019s decision to go to the city over and over again. So, when we stumbled\
  \ into an oasis of calm within Manhattan, full of elderly chess players and women\
  \ doing tai chi, it was a refreshing surprise.\n\nOur trip in 2018 resulted in us\
  \ having a similar experience, but this time with tiny superheroes, witches, and\
  \ Paw Patrol characters. Following our visit to the natural history museum (pro\
  \ tip: it\u2019s cheaper to buy tickets in-person), and before our trip to the theatre\
  \ district, my mother and I ventured out into the Upper West Side to find a restaurant\
  \ for dinner. It was during this walk that we discovered a local Halloween tradition\
  \ that we had never heard of, and thought was quite ingenious. \n\nAll around us,\
  \ children and their parents (with many wearing their child\u2019s discarded masks\
  \ or hats) were entering shops and restaurants, and exiting with slightly heavier\
  \ candy bags. It appeared, that the local businesses had come together to provide\
  \ opportunities for trick-or-treating for the community children. Our guess was\
  \ confirmed when we sat down to dinner in a small but popular Italian restaurant,\
  \ only to immediately hear a chorus of children cry out \u201CTRICK OR TREAT\u201D\
  \ in the entry-way.\n\nFinishing dinner and heading south, we continued to see this\
  \ happen in barber-shops, a Starbucks, and a sushi restaurant. The majority of the\
  \ trick-or-treaters reached the end of their journey at around 69th Street, where\
  \ music was playing and barricades were set up: an outdoor Halloween dance.\n\n\
  Our Halloween adventures continued both during Mean Girls, where the audience was\
  \ given mouse ears for a themed group photo, and afterwards, when I was shouted\
  \ at by a young man on a bar balcony, wearing a cat costume. While I didn\u2019\
  t understand either the humour or the symbolism at first, it later dawned on me\
  \ that I (still wearing my mouse ears) had just been\u2026 cat-called.\n\nThe next\
  \ morning, which was also our last morning in the city, was no less eventful, as\
  \ we headed to Central Park for a walk and hopefully an escape from the unexpected\
  \ heat. We discovered that the Park\u2019s main paths are a treasure trove of both\
  \ tourist trinkets and stunning local art, as well as a site for the city\u2019\
  s schools\u2019 track meets. While the former was a more satisfying discovery, trying\
  \ to escape the barricades set up for the race (luckily the runners had already\
  \ passed by) certainly makes for an amusing story. As does our accidental emergence\
  \ on the wrong side of Central Park, and our subsequent run and cab ride to the\
  \ Port Authority Bus Terminal.\n\nBut that\u2019s a story for another time."
