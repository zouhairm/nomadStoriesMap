Text: "In Downtown Los Angeles, the United States, I would tip to take a picture with\
  \ a Johnny Depp impersonator in front of the TCL Chinese Theatre. In Baalbek, Lebanon,\
  \ 2015, however, I experienced the shameful opposite. \n\nAfter a couple of hours\
  \ on a shared minivan, a popular choice for young backpackers to travel outside\
  \ Beirut, my friend and I finally arrived at the desolate checkpoint leading to\
  \ the city of Baalbek, historically known as Heliopolis or City of the Sun in the\
  \ Hellenistic period. A listed UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Phoenician city boasted\
  \ the largest Roman sanctuary ruins to date. The temples of Jupiter, Bacchus and\
  \ Venus built from the 1st century B.C. to the 3rd century A.D. were transformed\
  \ into a basilica when Christianity was declared as the official religion of the\
  \ Roman Empire in 313 A.D. and later a fortress between 7th and 16th century A.D.\
  \ under the Arab rule.\n\nWe got off the car on a late weekday morning, cautiously\
  \ walked past some stern Hezbollah security officers, and smiled back to the locals\
  \ whose faces showed curiosity and welcome. Along the monochrome asphalt roads lined\
  \ a scattering of dilapidated hotels, shabby restaurant signs and street vendors\
  \ selling scarves. Wondering the profitability of local businesses, I stopped by\
  \ a small store and found an electric generator geared up for customers to browse\
  \ through artifacts and silverware in times of scheduled power cuts. To my surprise,\
  \ the quality of the products appeared finer than those displayed in the souvenir\
  \ shops in Beirut. On the right side stood the sacred Sayyida Khawla Mosque, shrine\
  \ of a granddaughter of Imam Ali whom Shia Muslims around the world revered as the\
  \ rightful successor to Prophet Muhammad. Elaborate turquoise and emerald tiles\
  \ embellished the mosque\u2019s exterior walls, and adorned the dull and empty neighborhood.\
  \ \n\nAfter going through the sections of the Propylaea, Hexagonal Forecourt and\
  \ Great Court, I reached the main site of the Temple of Jupiter. Despite amidst\
  \ the color of loess, I marveled at the vast Roman architectural design, elegant\
  \ Corinthian columns and sophisticated reliefs on the megaliths. Just as I was indulged\
  \ in taking photos of the ruins, a man approached me and started talking in mixed\
  \ Arabic and French. His eyes exuded delight and passion, whereas I felt hopeless\
  \ as I understood none of his words. \n\nMy gesture of apology, nonetheless, did\
  \ not relinquish his enthusiasm. Thankfully, my friend came and broke the embarrassment.\
  \ It turned out that the man wanted to help take pictures of me with the six iconic\
  \ Corinthian Columns. In immediate thought, my friend and I suspected his offer\
  \ to be a charged service and asked him of the price. He waved his hands with a\
  \ big smile and signaled me to give him my camera. My friend whispered to my ears,\
  \ \u201CBe careful!\u201D and continued her tour. I stared into the man\u2019s eager\
  \ eyes and the next second, I surrendered my camera. He grasped my camera swiftly\
  \ and pointed at several spots for me to sit, stand and posture. He even demonstrated\
  \ different poses for me to mimic and I followed his instructions. \n\nAfter several\
  \ photo shoots, he returned my camera and began his introduction of the site. I\
  \ smiled and nodded as if I understood his language. Occasionally my friend would\
  \ show up and translate. I made sure to thank him in English, Arabic (shukran) and\
  \ French (merci) every time he made a pause. I could not help but feel ashamed by\
  \ my previous attitude mistaking his kind offer as a plausible tourist trap and\
  \ camera scam."
