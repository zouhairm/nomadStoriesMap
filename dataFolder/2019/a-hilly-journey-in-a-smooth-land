Text: "On this very cloudy day, I found myself in Afikpo, a very beautiful town in\
  \ Ebonyi State, Nigeria. Though I came to see a friend but my visit turned into\
  \ uncertainty. This town was well planned and roads tarred with trees naturally\
  \ planted in some area. There were no busy buses for intra town transportation but\
  \ people were being conveyed by motorcyclists and tricyclists. The transport companies\
  \ here convey people with their buses to other states; a very few to Abakaliki,\
  \ the capital city of Ebonyi State. \n\nThe road was free, no traffic, no road blocks\
  \ like the previous town we drove passed, where the police and other security officers\
  \ mounted road blocks, causing traffic as they were collecting money from drivers\
  \ as prerequisite for not checking them. Afikpo has a clear road\u2014smooth one\
  \ at that.  The driver changed the vehicle to another gear, this time we were climbing\
  \ a hill. It was both freighting and pleasurable. I smiled to the cool breeze waving\
  \ at my face through the window of the vehicle I boarded. On this hilly road I looked\
  \ out and saw a valley, after the valley another hill. I saw houses, trees and people\
  \ in the valley. Does it mean people live in the valley here?  I must find out.\
  \  \n\nOur vehicle swung on the normal road to another direction. The road here\
  \ was sharply bent and people were walking on the ways so busy. That day was the\
  \ Eke Market day\u2014the biggest market in the history of Igbo. Baskets were resting\
  \ on women's head as they were dashing to the market. Some were carrying vegetables,\
  \ yam, garri etc. Men too were carrying different commodities to the market. \n\n\
  We were driving towards the market, I guessed; my guess was right. The bus stop\
  \ we alighted at, was situated close to Eke Market square Afikpo. The market was\
  \ so big. People were buying and selling. My friend came there and picked me with\
  \ his car. On our way, I discovered something\u2014a group of women clad on a uniformed\
  \ wrapper and blouse with musical instruments placed on their feet.  I asked him\
  \ to stop.\n\nI alighted and greeted the women smilingly. They reciprocated happily\
  \ knowing the fact I came to capture their activities. \n\n\"Mama, please what is\
  \ this you are holding?\" I asked one of the women.\n\n\"My son this is made from\
  \ bamboo tree and it's a musical instrument\", she said, then continued. \"Others\
  \ are called ogene, ekwe and udu\".\n\nInteresting. I watched as they began to perform.\
  \ The dried bamboo stems I saw were used, hitting on stones , and a sweet musical\
  \ sound was uttered, echoing into, and mixed with other instruments. Two women were\
  \ singing, some dancing, wriggling their waists. All were of the same age bracket.\
  \ I interviewed one of them, she told me that the cultural Music group was founded\
  \ in 1952. The name is Nkwa Nwaite.\n\nI greeted them and continued my journey with\
  \ my friend. We were going to the cave I heard one of the women mentioned. I must\
  \ see all before leaving the next day, I thought.  We drove meters away and I was\
  \ caught with something. A sandy beach called Ndibe Beach. We stopped by. I saw\
  \ children, adults, men and women having fun. Children were scooping sands on their\
  \ head, after which they'd rush to the water and wash off the sands. I looked other\
  \ way and saw a river and men with hooks and lines fishing. Others used nests, casting\
  \ them on the water and dragging out fishes into their boats. This is beautiful.\
  \  I snapped these with my camera. The uniqueness of the beach and the river situated\
  \ opposite without the water meeting each other got me. We must get to the cave.\n\
  \nThe road to the community where the cave is located was bad.  Very rocky and stony\
  \ road. Stone Crushing machines were found here as well. One needs to drive carefully,\
  \ else the stones could destroy one's car.  People are very poor in this community\
  \ called Ibii. They have no good road, pipe borne water, electricity. But they have\
  \ natural resources, caves and happiness. \n\nWe got to the cave and my happiness\
  \ became complete."
