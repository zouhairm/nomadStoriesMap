Text: "After the turmoil of the previous year, the last place I expected to find laughter\
  \ was an Italian butcher shop- of course, there is no butcher like the \u201Cbutcher\
  \ poet\u201D of Loro Piceno, Peppe Cotto.\n\nLoro Piceno is a hill town nestled\
  \ in the Le Marche region, far off the well-beaten path of Florence, Venice, and\
  \ Rome. Its western border is the Apennine mountains which it shares with Umbria\
  \ and a slice of Tuscany. The Adriatic spans the eastern border, while San Marino\
  \ lies to the north. It\u2019s an area that offers everything people want from Tuscany-\
  \ without the hordes of tourists. \n\nThe plan was to assemble our blended families\
  \ to celebrate my father-in-law and his wife\u2019s retirement. It was perfect combination\
  \ of his love for all things Italian with her urge to explore somewhere less travelled.\
  \ Ten of us in total included: my husband, our two children, my sister-in-law, her\
  \ husband, and their daughters. \n\nMonths before I wasn\u2019t even sure if I would\
  \ be going. The trip came on the heels of months of job uncertainty. A few weeks\
  \ before we had to make the final go/no-go decision, I was told the teaching position\
  \ I\u2019d held for three years was being eliminated due to budget cuts. \n \nMy\
  \ year of tenuous employment was nothing compared to the unexpected loss of my mother-in-law\
  \ a year and a half before. Although she and my father-in-law long ago divorced\
  \ and found love and lives with new people, the hole she left touched us all. Ultimately,\
  \ it was remembering her enthusiasm for life that tipped the scales toward go. With\
  \ a bad impression of my mother-in-law\u2019s signature mispronunciation of, \u201C\
  Salute,\u201D we made our reservations.\n\nAfter days gelato melting heat of Venice\
  \ and Rome, the villa felt like a refuge. Standing with a glass of wine in hand,\
  \ my father-in-law surveyed the view. Taking a sip, he didn\u2019t say a word, but\
  \ nodded his approval. Stone farms hundreds of years old dotted the rolling fields\
  \ with picture-ready hill towns in the distance. This was the real Italy, so perfect\
  \ I was sure that any second strains of Puccini would emanate from the landscape.\n\
  \nThe trip coincided with my husband and my ten-year anniversary, although we had\
  \ nothing planned. Most of our week was left open with one exception: a cooking\
  \ lesson. Our guide to the local cuisine, Moreno Moretti, knew exactly how we should\
  \ celebrate. \n\n\u201CLeave it to me,\u201D he said pulling out his phone. A few\
  \ minutes later, our evening was arranged. \u201CMy friend, Peppe, he ran to the\
  \ restaurant to make you a reservation. You will stop at his place first for an\
  \ aperitif. He\u2019s a\u2026well, he\u2019s crazy. You just have to meet him.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe next night ten of us stood shoulder-to-shoulder in brightly colored shop.\
  \ Wearing a white smock and a paper cap that tidied his shoulder length curly brown\
  \ locks, Peppe Cotto emerged looking the part of a butcher- however, postcards and\
  \ newspaper clippings from around the world in addition to an unusually whimsical\
  \ charcuterie display told us this was much more than a stop for an aperitif.\n\n\
  \u201CDo you like music?\u201D he asked.\n\nFrom the depths of his counter he retrieved\
  \ what appeared to be a large rawhide dog chew with a few strategically drilled\
  \ holes. Putting it to his lips it transformed into a trombone. Seconds later with\
  \ the flick of a remote the shop filled with the sounds of Miriam Makaba. The horn\
  \ was replaced with another Peppe Cotto creation- a long pole ringed with bones.\
  \ With the first strains of \u201CPata, Pata\u201D he began shaking the stick in\
  \ time to the music. Almost instantly the ten of us were laughing and dancing to\
  \ the music with Peppe Cotto as the conductor. \n\nAfter an impression of artist\
  \ Raphael complete with a frame he finished his performance by filling six flutes\
  \ with his own vino cotto the area\u2019s special cooked wine, and four with sparkling\
  \ cider each garnished with his shop\u2019s own ciauscolo.\n\nWith a glance at my\
  \ husband, I raised my glass, \u201CSalute,\u201D we said in unison. A smile spread\
  \ across each of our faces. Despite all the last year\u2019s hardship, I knew we\
  \ would be fine."
