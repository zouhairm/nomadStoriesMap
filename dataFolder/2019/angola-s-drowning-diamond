Text: "Paddling in Angola is intimidating. The horrific 27-year civil war that raged\
  \ across its wild savannahs cut the beautiful country and its whitewater off from\
  \ the outside world. Now, the doors of this incredible African country are open,\
  \ and Angola is on track to become an adventure mecca; a destination full of towering\
  \ mountains, untouched wilderness and endless whitewater. In 2018, despite the odds\
  \ stacked against them, Mike Dawson, Dewet Michau, and Jake Holland embraced the\
  \ challenge of Angola, beginning with Africa\u2019s fourth-largest river: The Kwanza.\n\
  \nHEADER 2\n\u201CRumors of a river on the same scale of the Zambezi laden with\
  \ rapids but hidden behind the bureaucracy of an African government have long been\
  \ whispered throughout the whitewater community,\" writes Mike Dawson. Rumours that\
  \ lured Dawson to the once war-ravaged country of Angola rumours Dawson has helped\
  \ prove to be true. Dawson, Dewet Michau and Jake Holland braved croc charges and\
  \ threats of arrest to be the first to bear witness to the brutal beauty of the\
  \ Kwanza River\u2019s towering mountains, untouched wilderness, and endless whitewater\
  \ already succumbing to the threat of hydro. \n\nThis expedition was more than a\
  \ kayaking trip \u2013 it was an adventure. An adventure that started by travelling\
  \ across the remote, undeveloped regions of half a continent on the way to the put-\
  \ in. The journey took us, myself, New Zealander Mike Dawson, South African Dewet\
  \ Michau and Brit Jake Holland through South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, and Namibia\
  \ before entering Angola. \n\nCountless rumours of incredible whitewater in Angola\
  \ have circulated throughout the paddling community for many years, but it wasn\u2019\
  t until 2015 when myself and Aaron Mann led an exploratory trip to the wild west\
  \ of Africa that Angola\u2019s whitewater potential was first unlocked. Our objective\
  \ for this mission was the Lauca Gorge of the Kwanza River-Africa\u2019s fourth-largest\
  \ river system.\n \nLAND OF PLENTY\nAngola\u2019s geography creates an abundance\
  \ of rivers that drop off the edge of the Bie Plateau into the Atlantic Ocean, creating\
  \ endless prospects for hydro-electric schemes and endless whitewater for those\
  \ willing to explore. The Kwanza originates in the Bie Plateau, which feeds the\
  \ Okavango Delta as well as three of Africa\u2019s four major river systems \u2013\
  including the Congo and the Zambezi. The Kwanza winds its way along the Plateau\
  \ before continuing its 960-kilometre journey through the heart of Angola to the\
  \ Atlantic Ocean. It\u2019s crystal clear waters are the lifeblood of Angola. The\
  \ upper reaches provide fish, drinking water and irrigation for the local communities,\
  \ while further west its role changes to supply energy via the countless dam projects\
  \ in the lower sections. Fuck dams. One can only imagine what lies hidden below\
  \ the man-made lakes.\n\nDespite its promise, a kayak expedition here is intimidating,\
  \ to say the least \u2013 with many factors that continually keep a team in check.\
  \ Remnants of the brutal civil war that ravaged the nation in a battle for power\
  \ are everywhere. Millions of unexploded landmines still cripple communities and\
  \ forced us to stay on the beaten track. Though most of the large wildlife was eaten\
  \ during the war, a high concentration of crocodiles remains, fattened by 27 years\
  \ of death and destruction. Then there is the human factor: bandits, armed robberies,\
  \ corrupt officials, illegal mining, and a considerable amount of munitions. \n\n\
  As we made our way across the southern African continent tensions built, our imaginations\
  \ ran rampant picturing a hostile, war-torn wasteland. Once in Angola, our preconceptions\
  \ dissipated. We were welcomed by a ruggedly beautiful country filled with the smiling,\
  \ hospitable faces of the Angolan people who showed us nothing but kindness and\
  \ hospitality."
