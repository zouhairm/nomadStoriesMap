Text: "What if I\u2019m an Icelander? I mean not by place of birth or by passport\
  \ but just for the time being. I am in an Icelandic state of mind and my psycologist\
  \ should have noticed that if he or she existed. So, I am currently Icelander. Currently,\
  \ for a couple of days, from 3pm to 5pm or at the Sunday dinner table. These are\
  \ not some emigrant plans and not even a  strong desire to travel. This is what\
  \ comes from inside, an infection that has been spread throughout the whole body\
  \ and brain. This parasite has infected my only weakness - visual imagination. My\
  \ brain works only with the help of pictures: either seen and created by me or boldly\
  \ stolen from others. I look at something and my brain grabs the aesthetics of the\
  \ moment. It compiles the world into an ideal visual with no filters, with a right\
  \ exposure and sharpness. The whole world comes through eyes and is in the eyes.\
  \ Perhaps, that\u2019s why if I were blind, I would die from a total darkness.\n\
  \nSo... coming back to Iceland. I have never visited it. It may seem absurd to write\
  \ a travelling essay without ever gasping in amusement at the sight of the places\
  \ you are writing about. But travelling is about feelings. People write about mutual\
  \ love tons of pages without ever experiencing it, too, after all. Currently I have\
  \ only pictures of Iceland in my mind: pilfered from others or deductedly created,\
  \ but my brain demands the real ones, his own. I desperately want to be dazzled\
  \ with the colours of the cold waterfalls, wet boulders, damp soil mixed with edibly-green\
  \ shades. And also lupine colours, killing blue ones and my favourite unBordeaux\
  \ bordeaux. Sometimes you have a chance to meet straw yellow shades if there\u2019\
  s luck.\n\nI'd be sitting on the edge of the cliff, observe the offended ocean,\
  \ peer through the clouds trying to discern Greenland in the distance. I'd be inhaling\
  \ local mosses and taking pictures of the sun refraction with my best tool - eyes.\
  \ This is the only thing I want right now. I truly believe that paranoic dreams\
  \ have a tendency to come true, and I believe even more that my Iceland will be\
  \ on point, special and without any accidental people. That is why I postpone the\
  \ trip and don't rush. Let the fjords ripen. Mine will be mine. We will meet in\
  \ Reykjav\xEDk and don't forget a bright raincoat."
