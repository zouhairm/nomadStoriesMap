Text: "Tourists usually get a disease called The Touristic Sight. Most of the times\
  \ the symptons can't even be felt and the contamination ends as soon as their vacation.\
  \ The whole thing about this illness is that it only makes you see the beautiful\
  \ stuff. That part of town that was made only for you to see! \nYou are just passing\
  \ by and spending lots of money, no one wants you to be upset. I also got the The\
  \ Touristic Sight, as I said, it's very common and I didn\u2019t even realize I\
  \ did...\n\nThe sun had just set in Natal, leaving a colorful bright trail in the\
  \ Sky, right above the sea. A one of a kind spectacle. I was slowly sipping my drink\
  \ under a tent by the sea and that stunning work of nature was all I could see.\
  \ Wow, such a wonderful place to be! After a few minutes, tough, something in that\
  \ gorgeous landscape disrupted my joyful and chilling experience. It was a little\
  \ boy. He was tiny, barefoot, had worn out clothes on and a dirty face. He was asking\
  \ for food among other tourists, who, at this point, couldn\u2019t stop staring\
  \ at him either.\n\nSome guy gave him some food and then I invited him to seat by\
  \ my side. He declined the invitation. He seemed somewhat shy, maybe he thought\
  \ he wasn't worthy of my company. I didn't insist but tried to make some conversasion:\n\
  \n  \u2013 What's your name?\n  \u2013 Alexandre.\n  \u2013 Where are your parents,\
  \ Alexandre?\n  \u2013 I don't have any.\n  \u2013 How old are you?\n  \u2013 11\
  \ \u2013 he brushed his dark hair from his sweaty forehead. His chubby cheeks and\
  \ low height made him look even younger.\n  \u2013 Where do you live?\n  \u2013\
  \ Here... On the street.\n\nWhen he finished eating, I asked if he wanted to have\
  \ some more. He nodded. He wanted a hot dog. I promptly asked the waitress to make\
  \ him one. He pulled my t-shirt.\n\n\u2013 Can you split it in two? \u2013 he asked\
  \ softly.\nI found his request a bit odd, but asked the waitress to do so anyway.\n\
  \nWhen I finally gave him the split-in-half hot dog, I once again invited him to\
  \ sit next to me to eat it. He thanked me but turned it down again. He had to go.\
  \ He left dragging his little feet on the sand as I followed him with my eyes.\n\
  \nAs he moved further away, I watched as he gave one of the halves of his hot dog\
  \ to another child, in such a great act of humanity and kindness.\nAt that very\
  \ moment my stomach felt weird. I was no longer that hungry. All I wanted, more\
  \ than anything in the world, was to change Alexandre\u2019s life, the other child\u2019\
  s life and the lives of everyone who goes through the same as those two little kids.\
  \ But all I could do back then was go back to my hotel room and cry.\n\nI went back\
  \ home and never saw him again. But whenever I think about this trip, I don't recall\
  \ the stunning beaches, the local dishes nor the exuberant nature. I do recall healing\
  \ from The Touristic Sight, though. \n\nI think of Alexandre."
