Text: "In what was to become the first of many times, I thought to myself, \u201C\
  what am I doing here?\u201D. Mandy, my recently encountered best friend, sat to\
  \ my left. Despite her exhaustion, her eyes were alert, carefully noting the details\
  \ surrounding her. In front of us sat our friend Rick. Rumor had it he had a newborn\
  \ daughter on the other side of the world, and had come to Central America in a\
  \ panic, unable to cope with his new responsibilities, and hiding from his past.\
  \ He never acknowledged the rumors and avoided bringing up his life before, and\
  \ we didn\u2019t ask. That life was far away, irrelevant. The three brothers had\
  \ been with us up until now, but they had stayed behind; their fate, for the time\
  \ being, unknown. We sat in silence as the bus shook and rattled down the bumpy\
  \ road. Our poorly packed bags, indicative of a hasty departure, jostled between\
  \ our legs as we struggled to hold them upright. It was a little after one am (or\
  \ was it two?) and the back light of the bus flickered for the last time before\
  \ going out, leaving only the front illuminated. The other passengers, two ladies\
  \ in their fifties, seemed unfazed, though the new shadows heightened their somber\
  \ expressions. We were headed towards the border, hoping something, anything, awaited\
  \ us on the other side.\n\nThe three of us, and the brothers, had come together\
  \ working at a Costa Rican hostel. I was drawn to Mandy and Rick instantly, and\
  \ we became a trio fueled by an unadulterated desire to truly live every moment.\
  \ We were thus three lost souls, finding purpose united. Rick had suggested a border\
  \ crossing weeks ago, when the idea of adventure emboldened him. But that was before\
  \ Stephan.\n\nStephan was the type of man who could have fallen anywhere in the\
  \ range of 17 to 35 years old. Some days he sported the shadow of a beard, hair\
  \ disheveled, and the sleeplessness behind his hollow and sunken eyes aged him dramatically.\
  \ Other days, he appeared renewed, well dressed, his bulging eyes prepared to leap\
  \ from his face. Stephan was not the type of person you wanted to get to know, and\
  \ it wasn\u2019t just due to his off-putting manner, nor his inappropriate gestures\
  \ and antics, though those became increasingly more irritating. His unbecoming nature\
  \ alone was not why we disliked him. Stephan was dangerous.\n\nStephan\u2019s crew\
  \ moved in the shadows, new faces showing up unexpectedly during the night, the\
  \ intensity of their whispers filling the halls. Whatever arrangement he had with\
  \ the hostel owner, he was welcome to conduct his business on the premises. In essence,\
  \ Stephan disliked us (in particular he despised operating under our watchful eyes),\
  \ and we became acrimoniously tangled in his web of lies, which culminated in an\
  \ explosive showdown. What began as a mere bravado of intimidation on a hot and\
  \ rainy night quickly turned into violent confrontation, and soon we were imminently\
  \ imperiled, as he bolted the hostel to recruit his crew. We had no option but to\
  \ leave swiftly before his return to catch the only operating bus.\n \nAnd so, there\
  \ we sat, headed to the border. As the adrenaline slowly wore off, Rick produced\
  \ his headphones from his bag, placed them over his ears, moving his head rhythmically,\
  \ before suddenly bellowing aloud. The abrupt eruption of sound startled the lady\
  \ closest to us, who stared at him bewildered before slowly cracking a smile. The\
  \ second lady with the long braid looked up too, and began clapping her hands. We\
  \ could see the bus driver glancing from the rear view mirror, and soon his head\
  \ also began to bob. Our bus, filled with music and song in the dead of night, continued\
  \ its border destined journey. By the time we stepped off and prepared to cross,\
  \ our spirits were lifted, though we still had a long way to go. I reflected on\
  \ my current state: Itinerary out the window, no notion of time, the world unbound,\
  \ and most surprisingly, not one ounce of anxiety as I looked through the darkness\
  \ ahead of us. \u201CV\xE1monos?\u201D asked Mandy hesitantly. I hoisted my bag\
  \ over my shoulders. \u201CV\xE1monos!\u201D"
