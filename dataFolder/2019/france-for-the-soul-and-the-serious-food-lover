Text: "France for the Soul and the Serious Food Lover\nA spring trip to France is\
  \ truly rejuvenating! I proved to myself once again that traveling solo is good\
  \ for the soul. The rainy and slightly chilly weather did not spoil my spirit, although\
  \ I could have packed warmer clothing!\n\nThere are too many different and wonderful\
  \ regions to visit in France. I\u2019d been to Nice, the Riviera and Paris, so given\
  \ limited time, I chose Lyon, Avignon and Provence.  \n\nI planned my getaway with\
  \ one mission\u2014 to delight myself with plentiful gourmet food and be open to\
  \ new epicurean experiences.  I knew from the beginning that I wanted to visit Lyon,\
  \ still considered France\u2019s capital of gastronomy by many native French. Everything\
  \ surpassed my expectations.\n\nDuring the planning stage, my excitement led me\
  \ to an overwhelming flow of resources from email links and printouts, to recommendations\
  \ by friends.  In the end, it was just fun traveling with a small map in hand, discovering\
  \ each place freely and spontaneously. Yes, getting lost and perhaps not eating\
  \ gourmet food every meal was all part of the package. But isn\u2019t that what\
  \ adventures are supposed to be?  \n\nLyon, a gastronomical destination\nThe first\
  \ day in Lyon, I shopped and ate at famed Les Halles, an indoor food market that\
  \ now bears Paul Bocuse\u2019s name.  This is truly a pilgrimage everyone who loves\
  \ food should make, with its nearly five dozen stalls and restaurants that sell\
  \ everything: cheese, smoked salmon, seafood, charcuterie, foie gras and other delicacies.\n\
  \nI\u2019m not going to debate whether or not Lyon still lives up to its billing\
  \ at the food capital of France. All that mattered to me was to dine at Paul Bocuse,\
  \ also known as L\u2019Auberge du Pont de Collonges. Three Michelin Star Chef, Daniel\
  \ Boulud, also a native of Lyon, refers to this restaurant as \u201Cthe Sistine\
  \ Chapel of French Cooking\u201D.  As spontaneous as I can be, I did book a reservation\
  \ two months ahead.  Upon arrival on a very rainy day, the moment I got out of the\
  \ taxi, I was escorted by a ground staff to the main entrance of a palace-like restaurant,\
  \ and then greeted by the entire staff team.\n\nA reservation earlier than typical\
  \ arrival time for most patrons, meant I could enjoy the elegant ambience of the\
  \ main dining room.  The service by multiple waiters, the sommelier, head waiter\
  \ and the manager was impeccable.  All the dishes I ordered were scrumptious and\
  \ beautifully presented.  My starter was the world famous Soupe aux truffles noires\
  \ V.G.E., first created for a presidential dinner at the l\u2019Elys\xE9e Palace\
  \ in 1975.  For the seafood course, I ordered Filet aux sole avec nouilles (noodles)\
  \ Fernand Point; and then Rognon de veau \xE1 la dijonnaise\u2019 (veal kidneys).\
  \  The dessert course was presented with flair, featuring a cheese cart and large\
  \ selection of mouthwatering French desserts and chocolates.  During all the courses,\
  \ trolleys were moved between tables for presenting and carving the food. What a\
  \ beautiful traditional Lyon gastronomy experience!\n\nWalking and climbing medieval\
  \ Lyon\nLyon isn\u2019t just about food. There's are many upscale and luxury brands\
  \ designer shops on rue Edouard Herriot. I also spent a day exploring Old Lyon \u2013\
  \ the medieval neighborhood, which is also a designated UNESCO World Heritage site.\
  \  Most memorable moment was climbing up the flights of stairs; and then making\
  \ my way on a winding road and a steep hill until I finally reached Basillique Notre\
  \ Dame de Fourvi\xE9re.  Perched on a Fourvi\xE9re hilltop above old Lyon, the view\
  \ was simply breathtaking.\n\nRecommendations\nWhere to find fresh local produce\
