Text: "Laugavegur bustled with tens upon tens of bodies, bundled for the December\
  \ chill. It was 1600 and the sun had already sunk behind the snow dusted peaks across\
  \ Faxa bay. The last fragments of daylight hung delicately in the sky above them.\
  \ A bitter cold permeated my insides too, but this feeling was unrelated to the\
  \ climate. I'd never expected to be back in Iceland alone, 10 weeks after being\
  \ sexually assaulted by a man I'd met in Reykjavik on my first trip there.\nExploration\
  \ yields to no plan.\n\nWhen I'd arrived in Reykjavik in late September, the most\
  \ prominent sensation I'd experienced had been rooted in comfort. There was something\
  \ about the houses; their brightly colored roofs and their many windows, warm structures\
  \ nestled cozily together across quaint streets. Ironically, five days later it\
  \ would be inside one of those very houses that my trusting spirit would dim.\n\
  Within a reality I couldn't have imagined previously, I left Iceland changed.\n\n\
  Now I had returned in search of atonement. I wanted to find peace in the reminiscence\
  \ of driving through stark, bare mountain passes, with no company besides the music\
  \ on the radio. I wanted to feel as powerful as I did when I stumbled upon a sparsely\
  \ traveled gravel road in Grindav\xEDk, and the rusted abandoned shipwreck that\
  \ laid between it and the ocean. I wanted to seek out the serenity of treading through\
  \ those fine black sands: the ones that had comforted me during the moments in which\
  \ fear overcame my understanding of what it is to travel alone.\nI cried in the\
  \ airport before boarding. I hardly remembered getting on the plane. In the darkness\
  \ of early morning, on a shuttle bus from Keflav\xEDk, I questioned if I'd lost\
  \ my head.\nStill, when I saw the towering expressionist spire of Hallgr\xEDmskirkja\
  \ Church on the horizon, I knew I was on a path to healing.\n\nAt first, the most\
  \ difficult facet of being back in Iceland was the endless doubting; forgotten woes\
  \ and uncertainties bubbling to the surface, calling into question whether or not\
  \ I deserved to grieve. On the second day of my pilgrimage, laying listless in a\
  \ hostel bed at 1000, I understood what I would have to do.\nI didn't want to, but\
  \ I walked. Past the brightly colored Aktu Taktu, across a vacant S\xE6braut, along\
  \ the Sculpture & Shore Walk. Next to the turquoise-grey, white tipped waves, misting\
  \ me as I passed.\nAfter 40 minutes, I reached Blue Car Rental.\nThe woman at the\
  \ desk was cordial and formal, taking my information as well as several photographs\
  \ of the body of the vehicle before I stepped in.\nI sat frozen behind the wheel\
  \ for several minutes.\nThen I drove.\n\nWeaving through roundabouts, heading north\
  \ on \xDEj\xF3\xF0vegur 1, I pulled aside whenever natural wonders or strong emotion\
  \ enveloped me. I'd started out with no direction, but soon I knew where I would\
  \ go. I would find the Northern Lights.\nIt was something I'd wanted to achieve\
  \ during my first visit, but distracted by a foreign fling and subtle manipulations,\
  \ I hadn't gotten around to the task. In this moment, I had a second chance.\nI\
  \ checked the weather forecast, and felt confident that if I kept heading north\
  \ towards Laugarbakki, I would find the lights.\nI drove for two hours on desolate\
  \ roads. Ten cars passed me in that time. Careening through the darkness was like\
  \ flying through space. Finally, I caught it out of the corner of my eye; a faint,\
  \ green, dancing glow in the atmosphere above me. It was barely visible. An unsuspecting\
  \ eye might not have seen it. Yet, shivering and looking to an open sky on the side\
  \ of a road, just past a tiny town I cannot recall the name of, I was triumphant.\n\
  I was awake. I was alive.\n\nThe morning after, I sat alone upon the shore of an\
  \ untouched lake. There was no sand; only the tiniest of twisted, multicolored seashells.\
  \ The air was crisp, wet and cold. I'd tried to burrow into my jacket, huddled on\
  \ a rock, staring out into the grey. A gust of wind drove past: I knew I would be\
  \ carried, too."
