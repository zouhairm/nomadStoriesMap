Text: "Porto, 31th January.\nThe plane took off and conquered the sky. The destination\
  \ was an unknown city (at least for me) bathed by the Loire.  A new country, a new\
  \ adventure, a new life but I was not aware of that.\nThe first that I saw in this\
  \ city was the island in the middle of the river and when the aircraft landed, I\
  \ only thought that it was my new reality.\nNantes is the name of the city and this\
  \ story is my history.\nIf you want to know my first impression, I only can say\
  \ that I hated this city. Navette bus is not the best way to get to know the city.\
  \ Because I started in the suburbs and this is always a bad idea.\nWhen I arrive\
  \ here, the town was dismayed by Emiliano Sala\u2019s death. Place Royale was totally\
  \ full of football t-shirts, yellow flowers and condolence messages. It was not\
  \ the welcome that I expected, but I could see the warmth of the people.\n5 euros\
  \ for a beer? Have we gone crazy? \u2013 I thought and it was not for less, coming\
  \ from Spain. It was official: one day in Nantes and I only saw bad things flying\
  \ over the city, as smog. \nI did not fall in love with the city until I went to\
  \ my new school. I took the tram in Vincent Gauche without knowing where I had to\
  \ stop. Aimlessly but eager to get there. \nLine 2 crosses the river Erdre. This\
  \ was my main discovery and it was enough. I could appreciate beauty of the boats,\
  \ of the cobbled riverbank and suddenly, I just wanted it to be spring, to be there.\
  \ \nMore surprising was going to Brittany Tower, the highest building of the city.\
  \ 144 metres, 32 floors. Arriving there costs one euro after waiting around 20 minutes.\
  \ When you arrive to Le Nid you are entering a new dimension. Do you imagine some\
  \ seats inspired on the storks? Only here it\u2019s possible. Only Jean Julien (\u201C\
  Je suis Charlie\u201D designer) could dream it. After travelling his world, you\
  \ can enjoy the terrace. I promise you that the best Nantes\u2019s views are there.\
  \ You have to look for the egg that the stork has lost between the city roofs. \n\
  You also have to discover what is the cathedral. Saint Nicolas? Sainte Croix? Saint\
  \ Pierre and Sant Paul? Because each one is more interesting. \nAfter that, I have\
  \ discovered the city nightlife. My first visit was Warehouse, in the island. For\
  \ the reasonable price of 17 euros, you can enjoy the best techno music and even\
  \ a giant Bob Sponge. The alcohol is more than infamous but you cannot expect nothing\
  \ better in the city where you even pay for breathing. The best part of the night?\
  \ Seeing the Buren Rings: green, blue, red and green again. The rings that embellish\
  \ the port black history, and never better said. \nHangar 21 was an important port\
  \ in the ancient France, not only known by the huge quantity of bananas that it\
  \ was there, but also was the first slave port in Europe. Of that port, only the\
  \ cranes remain. What the hell? I though that first time that I saw it. Is this\
  \ a monument? Why? But it\u2019s important to know that Nantes not only remembers\
  \ its history, but it takes pride in it. \nThe next day, my hangover was like to\
  \ be dying in life, but my traveling spirit did not take pity on me and my friends\
  \ and me were to Place Graslin, a beautiful place in the city centre. Some musicians\
  \ were waiting for us to the rhythm of The Little Mermaid. I was not under the sea\
  \ but I could so because of the rain. The Cigalle was as I expected: expensive,\
  \ but it is worth it. Art Nouveau in its purest state.\nI have to discover more\
  \ of this city, but these was my first impressions. Beginnings are never easy, but\
  \ everything is better when you arrive here. \nWe will continue informing."
