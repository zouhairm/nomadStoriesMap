Text: "My trip to the Dominican Republic\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I was to leave\
  \ to the Dominican Republic at 10p.m. on a Thursday night. My flight was with Tower\
  \ Air and it was leaving John F. Kennedy airport. I had to be there three hours\
  \ before departure and I was I was there at 7p.m. It felt like they longest wait\
  \ of my life. At 9:30p.m,they announced that we would not be leaving on time because\
  \ the plane had technical difficulties. Our flight would now leave at 12p.m. I couldn't\
  \ believe this was happening to me. It was a nightmare. They had already changed\
  \ my flight like five times before. I was leaving one day, then I was leaving the\
  \ next and so on. Then they wait for the last minute and the food shop had closed,\
  \ so there is about a good 200 or so people without food and all upset cursing up\
  \ a storm. To top it all off, half of the people there were teenagers going to the\
  \ Dominican Republic to play baseball. Can you imagine? A hundred something kids\
  \ hungry and sleepy screaming their lungs out.\n\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ However,\
  \ the nightmare wasn't over. They got us on the plane at about 2a.m because the\
  \ plane wasn't ready. I couldn't get on the plane because I kept buzzing when I\
  \ passed the medal detectors, so that took another 20 minutes. Then we are on the\
  \ plane and the plane isn't moving, and we are waiting and waiting and no explanation.\
  \ After a while the plane begins to move. It when around the run way and then they\
  \ tell us we must get of the plane. It needed more service repairs. At this point\
  \ I'm like give me my money back, and in return they call the cops because we were\
  \ making to much noise. They fix the problem around 5:30a.m and we are off again.\
  \ Keep in mind we haven't eaten and no food was given. I didn't even get water.\
  \ I thought this was a sign of god and my time had come for me to die, but I made\
  \ it there in one piece."
