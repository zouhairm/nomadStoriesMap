Text: "For my college class \"Photo Documentary abroad\" I decided to return to Estonia.\
  \ In the eastern city of Narva, at the border to Russia, I wanted to ask the locals\
  \ whether they were afraid of a russian attack, like it happened on the crimean\
  \ peninsula in 2014. All of my goals turned out to be difficult to achieve, though.\
  \ First: Asking the locals is hard if you don't know russian! Like a parrot I repeated\
  \ the one sentence I learned beforehand: \"Hi, I'm Marcus, I study Photojournalism\
  \ in Hannover, Germany. I don't speak Russian, do you speak English?\" So my communication\
  \ was very limited, my Taxi driver in those two weeks in Narva was laughing and\
  \ (probably) telling me about life and his family anyway (in russian, of course).\
  \ Wait, we are still in Estonia, right? Why are all the signs, all the words, all\
  \ the food so russian? Just a day ago I was in Estonias capitol Tallin, ordering\
  \ my Chai Latte Machiato To-Go in english and felt so very cosmopolitan and home.\
  \ Now I point at things that I want to eat, earning concerned looks of elderly shopkeepers.\
  \ The situation got a lot better in the second week of my stay in the City of Narva,\
  \ which was basically the Power Plant of nearby St. Petersburg during Soviet times.\
  \ Coal and water electricity plants encircle the border town, but are mostly shut\
  \ down, no one needs them anymore. But what I needed was a translator, which I found\
  \ in the moustached shape of radio host Mikhael. Knocking at his studio door he\
  \ opened with a wide grin, inviting me to tea and a chat about what the heck I am\
  \ doing in sleepy little Narva. What he told me was that people here are not afraid\
  \ of russia at all, most of them consider themselves russian anyway and moved to\
  \ estonia for better pensions and higher life standard. Using the so called \"Friendship\
  \ Bridge\" the can cross back into russia whenever they want. Or so the used to,\
  \ today it is a lot of paperwork to cross the little bridge into the russian federation,\
  \ hard for old people to manage. So they just stay, in Estonia, living a russian\
  \ life there. \"So, what passports do they have? Russian, Estonian?\" I asked, \"\
  Neither,\" Mikhael answered \"they have the grey Aliens Passport, they don't belong\
  \ to any state.\" That's the moment my journey started to make sense and I started\
  \ asking for people with grey passports, asking them about their life in between\
  \ borders, countries, cultures\u2026\n\nI came home with stories I never expected\
  \ to find, made connections to people I never thought I'd meet and all of this was\
  \ a big leap into the unknown for me, so I'm not really sure what theme my story\
  \ is\u2026 but I came to Narva to connect myself with the life of others, take pictures\
  \ and tell their story. So I'll just stick with that. Thank your for reading, all\
  \ the best.\n\nMarcus"
