Text: "The smell of cigarette and spiky beard poking my cheeks were the some of the\
  \ sweet memories from my late-grandpa, whom I adore a lot. Both of my grandpas passed\
  \ away when I was quite small. \n\nOne early morning, my sister and I were travelling\
  \ from Kyoto to Hiroshima via shinkansen. As we bought the JR pass, we need to change\
  \ train to shinkansen in Osaka. When we get into the train, the train is already\
  \ full-packed with people, leaving several single seats. As my sister and I planned\
  \ to sit separately, we were offered a seat from a gentleman stating that he will\
  \ be getting off in the next stop. Gratefully we received the seat, placed all of\
  \ our luggage to the top rack, and rested. \n\nThe train moved towards Hiroshima\
  \ making stops in some cities between Osaka and Hiroshima. One of the train attendants\
  \ passed us through and then asked how we would like the coffee to be. We were confused\
  \ because not only it is in Japanese but also we are not ordering any coffee in\
  \ the first place; until we crossed eyes with sweet kind eyes sitting next to us.\
  \ He is quite an old man, just like my grandpa. He said and I quote, \"Free, for\
  \ you\". We were even puzzled, but since he insisted, so we accepted the coffee\
  \ gladly, and with my broken Japanese language ability, I uttered: \"\u3042\u308A\
  \u304C\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307E\u3059\" (Arigatou gozaimasu). \n\nI made\
  \ eye contact with my sister hoping she would break a conversation since I am pretty\
  \ much an introvert, but she does not seem to get my hint. Fortunately, I brought\
  \ some mochis, which I bought earlier in the morning. I offered him some mochis\
  \ in exchange for his kind offering of coffee. Then we started to talk. Honestly,\
  \ I could not understand his story fully, and maybe he did not understand my story\
  \ fully too, because he could only speak in Japanese, and I could barely greet in\
  \ Japanese. He patiently talked about his life, wife and his daughter. We tried\
  \ to tell him about our journey in Japan. It was super hard, funny and interesting.\n\
  \nAfter some times, we decided to take a rest in making effort to converse. The\
  \ train passed through Okayama station. I looked at the windows looking out. It\
  \ made me think of my grandpa. How different my life will be if my grandpa is still\
  \ alive, would we go on a vacation together, taking trains, sitting next to each\
  \ other, sipping coffee from the train, eating mochis and changing stories or maybe\
  \ debating about life? Those were the days that I would really miss my grandpa.\
  \ Just like the old man who sits next to us, I had little knowledge about my grandpa,\
  \ however, I am not sure why meeting that old man would make me miss my grandpa\
  \ a lot.\n\n\"Hiroshima, Hiroshima next stop Hiroshima\", was announced. As we heard\
  \ that, we prepared ourselves for alighting. That old man was so kind, and he helped\
  \ us with our luggage, which are very heavy. You should never underestimate what\
  \ two girls could squeeze in the luggage. I could see him struggled a bit, resembling\
  \ my grandpa. I bet he would definitely help out despite difficulties. As the train\
  \ stopped, we got off the train along with him. He kindly introduced and took us\
  \ to an udon store in the train station, and treated us with a bowl of udon. We\
  \ chatted more and exchanged contacts too.\n\nI am astonished as to how far a Japanese\
  \ could go for a stranger. I am glad that I took the train to Hiroshima, and met\
  \ that grandpa. I hope I could meet him again! \n\nPreviously, when I think of Hiroshima,\
  \ I would first think of a city bombed during world war two. Now, if you asked me\
  \ about Hiroshima, I would first remember this story started with a cup of coffee.\n\
  \n\u201CDon't listen to what they say. Go see.\u201D - Chinese Proverbs. Looked\
  \ what a cup of coffee has changed my mind about a place."
