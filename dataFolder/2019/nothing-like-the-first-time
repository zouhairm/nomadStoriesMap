Text: "As I stand atop the Acropolis, I\u2019m in utter awe of the breath-taking view\
  \ of the city. I can see what seems like the entire city from here. A beautiful\
  \ landscape of Athens spread across my entire vision. It\u2019s moments like this\
  \ that make me realize nothing beats seeing things for the first time. The exhilarating\
  \ feeling of having just seen a brand new landscape is unbeatable. \n\nGetting here\
  \ was no easy feat. Ascending from downtown Athens to the top of the hill in blistering\
  \ hot weather was enough to make me sweat. But, going through all those charming\
  \ cobble streets of the Plaka made it all that much more interesting. As I followed\
  \ the narrow, almost labyrinth-like streets towards my destination, I came across\
  \ many cozy cafes with chairs and tables set on flower-filled stairways or in simple\
  \ shady taverns. \n\nThe Plaka is the oldest section of Athens. It sits right under\
  \ the Acropolis and stretches almost to Syntagma. Most of the streets have been\
  \ closed to automobile traffic, which makes strolling through even more enjoyable.\
  \ I was glad to have chosen this leisurely path to climb to the top of the Acropolis.\n\
  \nHere, locals live a different lifestyle and I enjoyed observing it. From sipping\
  \ coffee at outdoor cafes to people watching from their windows, the Greeks have\
  \ a way of enjoying the moment doing the simplest things. Finding stillness, catching\
  \ up with friends, and enjoying human connection is what they do best. There\u2019\
  s something about their calm demeanor that makes you wonder how they\u2019re able\
  \ to achieve it. A vast contrast to the fast-paced and busy lifestyle of North Americans.\
  \ \n\nThe heart of Athens is filled with hidden treasures steeped in history. And,\
  \ one of the best things about souvenirs in Athens is that finding the perfect one\
  \ is an adventure in itself that can be as exciting as checking out the sites. You\
  \ can find all kinds of trinkets and Greek-style art to take home to help you remember\
  \ your trip for a long time to come. \n\nHaving spent the first day in the city\
  \ shopping and enjoying local cuisine, I was ready for my next adventure. Ready\
  \ to discover the history of one of the most famous landmarks in the world. And,\
  \ visiting the Acropolis was at the top of the list for me to discover. \n\nNow\
  \ that I\u2019m here, in front of a two and a half thousand-year-old structure,\
  \ I need to take a moment to let it all sink in. I find myself supercharged with\
  \ wonder. It feels fitting that the name Acropolis means \u201CCity in the Air\u201D\
  . Standing here, looking down at the city below makes me feel like I\u2019m on top\
  \ of the world. I can see a colorful balance of buildings, greenery, and mountains\
  \ in the distance. And right next to us are some the world\u2019s oldest buildings\
  \ still in existence. \n\nBeing a symbol of the city\u2019s former glory and Greece\u2019\
  s most iconic attraction, it\u2019s hard not to be awestruck when you\u2019re standing\
  \ right in front of these ancient ruins. \n\nWhile wandering around the many archaeological\
  \ remains of the Acropolis, tourists can follow in the footsteps of Socrates, Pericles,\
  \ and Sophocles and discover the building blocks of Western Civilization. It\u2019\
  s a place to immerse yourself in culture and the most fascinating history lessons.\
  \ Not to mention, the Acropolis museum houses some of the most important ancient\
  \ Grecian statues, artwork, and artifacts. \n\nAfter exploring every nook and cranny\
  \ of the ruins, I sit next to my husband on a big rock facing the stunning view\
  \ of the city. We take a few moments to absorb everything we just experienced before\
  \ we leave this beautiful site. I\u2019m so glad I brought my camera because everywhere\
  \ I look, there\u2019s a picturesque opportunity to snap a photograph. I\u2019m\
  \ not sure I\u2019ve ever seen a more beautiful landscape of a city. \n\nI don\u2019\
  t know when, but I know I\u2019ll be back here again. Greece is just one of those\
  \ places where it\u2019s not enough to visit only once. Although, I\u2019m also\
  \ keen on exploring other parts of this fascinating country because there\u2019\
  s nothing like seeing things for the first time."
