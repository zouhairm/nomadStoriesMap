Text: "Standing along the shoreline with a team of five men, we wait for the Capitan\
  \ to return with the boat to carry us out into the ocean; eager to begin our early\
  \ s\xE9jour and claim our first catch. The dark sky meets the deeper shades of the\
  \ ocean at the horizon. A brisk breeze licks slivers of exposed skin as the mist\
  \ from the waves leave gentle, wet kisses on our faces. The arrival of the small,\
  \ wooden skiff stoke our excitement. \n\nThe Capitan veils me in a plastic tarp;\
  \ pressing one long, outstretched finger to his pursed lips, signaling me to be\
  \ silent and motioning me to climb into a small hole to be hidden from view at the\
  \ back of the skiff. \n\nI am an illegal passenger.\n\nAfter the devastating earthquakes\
  \ that rocked Ecuador in May 2016, many of the locals were excited to have business\
  \ again. I came to the newly dilapidated fishing town of Puerto Lopez as a way to\
  \ cope with my sudden and unexpected unemployment status with peace and relaxation.\
  \ I was a sheltered person who avoided risk; however, the moment that I discovered\
  \ my new passion in the ocean; I would do anything to get back on the water. \n\n\
  Arriving at this time allowed me to go places that were usually off-limits for tourists.\
  \ I had gone diving and paragliding many times overs and become a regular angler\
  \ setting out on various trips as a stowaway for 25 cents. These secret boating\
  \ trips gave opportunity to see the Humpback Whales up close as they passed under\
  \ our boat."
