Text: Sometimes you need to take a leap of faith and head towards the unknown. It
  was the early 2000s and I was searching for direction, searching for my purpose.
  I booked a spontaneous trip to Ireland, by myself, alone and scared. The love of
  my life has just died and I was spiraling out of control. I told myself that I would
  find joy in the trip or at least take in scenery. I didn't book a hotel or plan
  an itinerary, which is very unusual for someone as detail oriented as myself. When
  I touched down in Shannon I knew I made the right choice. People were welcoming
  and the weather was cold. It was pouring outside but I was ecstatic. I rented a
  car and headed up to Galway. It's amazing what taking your time can do when you're
  just trying to be aware of your surroundings. The scenery forever changed who I
  am. The vivid greenery was just as I had seen in pictures. Sheep were everywhere.
  Homes looked old. Traveling outside of the states really puts history in perspective.
  The people that I met during my time in Galway were exquisite. They allowed me to
  open up again and trust people. From Galway I traveled to Dingle, Ireland. Dingle
  may just be the prettiest little town I have ever been to. Full of thatched roofs,
  small pubs, lively music and incredible food. I always felt that travel was about
  connection and experiencing things you can't do at home. Anything to take you out
  of your comfort zone in order to grow. Travel changes you and it does so for the
  best. If I could travel the world while meeting people and experiencing culture
  I could die happily.
