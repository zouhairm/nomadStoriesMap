Text: "\u201CAnd for lunch we have crocodile...\u201D Mong Dao, my tour guide added.\
  \ His monotonous monologue was interrupted by the declaration. Churning the muddy\
  \ water, his streamer drifted towards his floating village on Tonle Sap Lake, Siem\
  \ Reap. I was lost in the sight of playful shimmering sunlight on the water. The\
  \ gentle breeze wafted in the smell of fish, salt and lake. \n\n\u2018Crocodile\u2019\
  \ caught my immediate attention. I turned towards him saucer eyed whispering, \u201C\
  What are we having for lunch?\u201D Not believing my ears.\n \n\u201CCrocodile\u201D\
  \ he replied nonchalantly with a shrug. Something on my face cracked up his sixty\
  \ plus suntanned wrinkly old face. The corner of his lips lifted up in crooked amusement.\
  \ Realizing it was his funny bones speaking, I let out a breath of relief. Together\
  \ we broke out into peals of laughter. \nMong was one amongst the thousands of ethnic\
  \ Vietnamese who found home away from home on this very \u2018no man\u2019s land\u2019\
  . Years between 1975 and 1979 witnessed the greatest massacre of the Khmer Rouge\
  \ regime in Cambodia. Mong fled his country amidst the political turmoil. Years\
  \ of deprivation, starvation and disease followed into meaningless nothingness.\
  \ With his family lost and dead in the scariest genocide of the 20th century, nowhere\
  \ to go and nothing to claim as his own, Mong a then teenager chose the most precarious\
  \ option of life, living on water. For he like many others had been denied their\
  \ identities by both the Vietnamese and Cambodian governments.\n\nAdaption is man\u2019\
  s best feat. This floating village breaks all doubt of man\u2019s ability and willingness\
  \ to live despite all odds.\n \n\u201CWelcome to my village\u201D proudly Mong gestured\
  \ towards the open water. Squinting against the glaring sun, I peered ahead. What\
  \ I saw made me gasp! \nDotted across the emerald water were small makeshift huts\
  \ made of wood, scraps of metals and tarpaulin. Few clustered together, rest separated\
  \ by the colorful algae water. Tiny boats were attached to all the houses. Some\
  \ floated lazily as the villagers went about doing their daily chores. With a depth\
  \ of nearly 10 feet, spreading over 2700 square kilometers, Tonle Sap Lake with\
  \ its floating village has its own poignant tranquil beauty. \n\nEssentially a fishing\
  \ community, the residents of the lake offer tour guides to earn an extra living.\
  \ They are the true survivors of mankind with lost land, lost nation and lost individuality.\
  \ What are we to our country and what a country is to us if there is no country\
  \ at all? Till you ponder on this, let me add that these people are freer than free.\
  \ A true liberated souls.\n\nManeuvering across the lake, Mong took me around his\
  \ village. More astonishments awaited. I saw a pristine white church with wooden\
  \ cross perched on rooftop. Laughter of small children filled the air as they rode\
  \ tiny boats towards a hut marked as \u2018school\u2019. They cheerfully waved at\
  \ me. It was a usual scene only in an unusual village. \n\nWe stopped at a floating\
  \ restaurant for authentic lunch. The bamboo structure was built on a complex network\
  \ of stilts. Separating the lower deck from the upper, the restaurant was indeed\
  \ unique. Sitting arrangements made of old oil barrels surrounded long wooden tables.\
  \ Towards the center of the building was an open space. Peering down the barricaded\
  \ area, I saw three crocodiles sunbathing. For a moment my heartbeat skipped.\n\
  \ \n\u201CNo they are not for your lunch.\u201D Mong replied my unasked question\
  \ laughing. The gentle water lapped the sides of the restaurant as we sat to enjoy\
  \ the fish amok, noodle soup and Angkor beer. An easy jovial stream of conversation\
  \ flowed. I asked him about his history, family and life. \n\nNot even for a moment\
  \ I felt, he regrets what life had offered him. Sad? Perhaps! But no regrets. I\
  \ asked him, \u201CWhat does your name mean?\u201D Exposing his yellow teeth in\
  \ his usual contagious smile, he replied \u201CHope.\u201D I inhaled sharply and\
  \ stared back at him.\n\nAnd indeed, it was hope that kept these people afloat and\
  \ alive. Carefully wrapped in the memories of the past with a hope for better future\
  \ these Vietnamese in Cambodia has definitely not forgotten to live love life."
