Text: "Self-expression in Milan is reigned by fashion. Some would suggest this is\
  \ the beating heart of the city, delving into the minds of people that call this\
  \ place home. There are plentiful opportunities to show an exemplary image of yourself.\
  \ In the day it is a bustling metropolitan shopping centre set in a Baroque-style\
  \ building, containing the level of romanticism you\u2019d expect of Italy- modern,\
  \ highly intricate window displays line the structure\u2019s edge. This then leads\
  \ to an open courtyard, comprising the Duomo with all its glory. Shops include the\
  \ likes of Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and many other highly appreciated designers, all\
  \ of whom boasted new collections during my visit for fashion week. Our tour guide\
  \ enthusiastically conveyed the history behind \u201CGalleria Vittorio Emanuele\
  \ II\u201D and pondered at the fact that there were two Prada stores.\n \nOne of\
  \ them had originally contained a McDonalds.\n \nAfter much debate (and a hefty\
  \ sum of money), the fast-food chain was replaced. It did not fit the image that\
  \ the Galleries were trying to uphold, and the smell of fries continually drifting\
  \ through the building did not help McDonalds\u2019 case. Still, the first thing\
  \ one sees when venturing outside the Galleries\u2019 arches is a humongous branch\
  \ of the chain.\n \nI yet again saw the Piazza on a crisp February night, whilst\
  \ sitting on the edge of the Vittorio Emanuel monument, listening to Reggaeton blaring\
  \ from the nearby bar. It was calm, the wave of tourists having disappeared along\
  \ with their selfie sticks and endless enthusiasm. Me and my companion decided to\
  \ go take pictures, posing vicariously for our Instagram feed. (It didn\u2019t happen\
  \ if it wasn\u2019t documented, correct?)\n \nWe met some other girls who had the\
  \ same idea, and took turns taking photos of each other. In these brief moments,\
  \ we had heaven to ourselves. The displays were as beautiful as in daylight, the\
  \ colours just as vibrant. I was told of a tradition of spinning three times anti-clockwise\
  \ on one of the tiles that lined the floor. Showing my love for cute traditions,\
  \ I turned my heels and span enthusiastically without a care in the world (besides\
  \ holding onto my friend\u2019s camera). \n\nOn my way back, I noticed a woman in\
  \ the distance. She was standing, covering herself with a colourful Afghan blanket.\
  \ Her belongings were scattered on the floor. My friend noticed me looking and explained\
  \ that a lot of homeless people take this place as shelter in the evenings, as it\
  \ provides some respite from the outside conditions. The woman stood gazing at the\
  \ Chanel display. I wondered what she was thinking. Polished jewels reflected off\
  \ of hand-held circular mirrors surrounding the window. It was as the designer had\
  \ aimed it to be - class meeting extravagance. She was standing, blankly staring\
  \ at herself in the mirror, as if analysing her surroundings rather than her own\
  \ features. I could not help noticing her and she turned my way. We held each other\u2019\
  s gaze.\nShe could be perceived as a blurred image of sorts, a scratch on an otherwise\
  \ pristine mosaic. Surrounded by a kaleidoscope of rich colours, her muted persona\
  \ somehow polished the scene. Concluding the stare and turning back to resume her\
  \ earlier activity, the unknown woman provided a caricature of modern society through\
  \ her essence alone."
