Text: "All of the seas: the seas. I see a river. It might be the Thames, with its\
  \ cigarette ends and dying rats being carried under the shadow of the Shard of Glass,\
  \ that stabbing, dark-glass building under the bleeding clouds of London. All of\
  \ the rivers: the river. Was it a river, then? A bridge: crossing from one side\
  \ to the other. I could feel Niagara. Buffalo - standing still, opposite these eyelids.\
  \ White feathers lingering in the wind like lingering ashes after a fire. The shrieking\
  \ seagulls' skulls would remorselessly be crashed against the ice with a gentle\
  \ brush of the breaking foam. The falls - this fall, I could not bear. These falls.\
  \ It might have been the Seine - where I so often searched for something, something\
  \ - a pair of eyes, a pair of rooted eyes that told me: you are this, or you are\
  \ that (but one can never say \"you are this\" or \"you are that\"). And not that\
  \ excrutiating flow distorting my reflected image. My? Image? I shall pass like\
  \ a cloud on the waves. Virginia said. She then filled her pockets with stones,\
  \ with heavy stones, with - maybe shells? - with time, that is, and let her body\
  \ sink as one's face sinks between the others.  All of the shores: the shore. It\
  \ was in the North of Scotland. That, I remember. For you know, I always remember.\
  \ That meticulous craftwork of mine, the carving of these memories, this constant\
  \ carving which gradually erodes my fingertips - and then, with dusted-off prints,\
  \ how shall I see, how shall I know I am. But then, that does not really matter.\
  \ \"Identity\" surely is a monstruous, vacuous word. Mere sound. But how beautiful.\
  \ But again, that does not really matter. For I know that you \"were\". You sat\
  \ over the cliff, not noticing, for you shall never notice, just like you shall\
  \ never remember. Nothing, nothing. As happy as you are, clenching time, I mean\
  \ the present, I mean, the only time, the only time existing, with your nails or\
  \ your bare skin. (Shall you ever know what love is?). And I remember the blades\
  \ of grass, pale green, leaning against your feet (praying, maybe?), and I remember\
  \ your shadow, growing larger, growing stranger with the descent of the sun. I know\
  \ that you were, and that you melted over the sea. The sea was grey, or white; the\
  \ sand dunes: humid. My eyes were humid. My eyes were humid, just as they were when\
  \ I thought my brother died. Humid as they were under the rain. It was at night,\
  \ in Porto. The haze over the ambiguous outlines of that burning church started\
  \ drawing convergent and divergent lines upon the air. Upon the air. Is that possible?\
  \ And I felt the humidity, the salt, between my fingers, and I missed a sea where\
  \ I could recognise myself. \n\nI should not. I should not, whatsoever. It is a\
  \ most peculiar mirror, that upon which we are constrained to look at, to search\
  \ for ourselves, every morning, every hour, and the hours after the hours after\
  \ the hours. The search, the search for what. For some familiar gaze, for some familiar\
  \ blaze upon those eyes which we, and only we, are forbidden to look at directly.\
  \ Never to look at one's eyes directly. Macabre paradox: never to be able to look\
  \ at one's eyes directly. \n\nAnd then, of course, these hands. These hands which\
  \ I hold, which I touch, which I feel, as if their strange solidity, as if their\
  \ strange internal hammering was that precise, yet subtle evidence of our being\
  \ here and now. But these nonsense abstractions. What I meant to say was (what?).\n\
  \nWhat I meant to say. There seems to exist a blurred, a fragile line between unity\
  \ and fragmentarity. That is to say, the limits of identity. \"These fragments I\
  \ have shored against my ruins\", Eliot dixit. Who will I greet tomorrow, in front\
  \ of the mirror, who will I happen to leap into: I cannot say nor guess, for I know\
  \ only a heap of broken images (Eliot dixit).\n\nAnd in every city, and in every\
  \ travelled street, I shall find and unfind myself."
