Text: "One day last July, Hokkaido was hit with torrential rainfall of more than 400mm,\
  \ turning roads into rivers. That was the day Debbie and I hitchhiked 170km from\
  \ Abira to Mashike. We were an hour away from our final destination, standing by\
  \ a skinny cliffside road overlooking the Sea of Japan.  Its grey and foamy waters\
  \ blended into the billowing storm clouds on the horizon. Monstrous waves crashed\
  \ against the cliff face, hungry for more land to consume. The cardboard sign we\u2019\
  d travelled the last 100km with was disintegrating in my hands. I propped it against\
  \ my chest so the characters spelling out Mashike were visible to passing drivers.\
  \ Most cars bore Sapporo license plates, all heading in the opposite direction.\
  \ \n\nDebbie spoke fondly of Mashike, the seaside town of 5000 people, known for\
  \ its sweet shrimp and Japan\u2019s northernmost sake brewery. In the mornings,\
  \ its coast would welcome fishing boats bringing in daily catches of flatfish and\
  \ octopus. Orchards spread across the rolling volcanic landscape bear apples and\
  \ cherries throughout late spring and summer. We had set our eyes on Mashike, eager\
  \ to engage with the farming community there.  However, with our last mode of communication\
  \ deforming into illegible mush, it seemed the new chapter of our journey would\
  \ be cut short. \n\nBehind us was the Ishikari Rest Area, where a doting retired\
  \ couple had dropped us off hours ago. Debbie acted as our sole communicator. Even\
  \ though her Japanese was rusty, she was brilliant at expressing complex ideas using\
  \ simple language. Kyoko smiled warmly as she told us about her two children. Her\
  \ son left his Tokyo office job to work on a dairy farm. We had come to Hokkaido\
  \ to learn about sustainable farming, and she seemed to understand the sentiment.\
  \  We got a taste of Kyoko\u2019s maternal love when they stopped to buy us chocolates\
  \ en route to Ishikari. I wanted to say more, but I only knew \"Arigatou.\" Thank\
  \ you. \n\nWe watched as a driver pulled out of the parking lot. He slowed down\
  \ to read our sign, shook his head, and drove off. Debbie and I exchanged a solemn\
  \ stare. My feet felt squishy in my socks. The edges of the cardboard sign were\
  \ turning to pulp where I held it. It felt like everything was being swallowed up\
  \ by water.\n\nFor a moment, only rain broke the deafening silence of a drowned\
  \ world. Somehow, a cyclist hooded in an orange poncho appeared from around the\
  \ winding road below, pedaling his way up the slippery incline. He stopped briefly\
  \ to inspect our tattered sign and ask about our travels before continuing towards\
  \ the rest stop. What we didn't expect was for the cyclist to return with cookies\
  \ and words of encouragement: \"Gambatte.\" Don't give up.\n\nWhen that blue car\
  \ slowed and then came to a stop in front of us, I felt my spirit jolt awake. The\
  \ couple driving, Yuka and Sasaki-san, were serendipitously delayed returning home\
  \ from a day trip to the temple. They parked at the rest stop and helped us load\
  \ our packs into their car. Yuka bought us hot coffee and buns, and even came back\
  \ with towels. She explained the workers at the Ishikari Rest Stop had been watching\
  \ us and asked her to pass along the towels. \n\nWhen I think of Mashike, I remember\
  \ the streets lined with marigolds, picking the sweetest ruby-coloured strawberries,\
  \ and learning how to use a chainsaw. We met tenderhearted strangers with a shared\
  \ desire for a sustainable future and global community along the way. Without them,\
  \ we would have shared the same fate as our cardboard sign. One time, a man told\
  \ us to \u201CPay it forward\u201D when we tried to reimburse him for the ride and\
  \ food. I don\u2019t know why I thought that was a sentiment only shared in Western\
  \ culture. I still wear the charm from the temple Yuka gave me at dinner the next\
  \ night. It serves as a reminder to pay kindness forward. All it needs is momentum\
  \ to weather any storm."
