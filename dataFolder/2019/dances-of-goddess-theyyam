Text: "I travel places to capture the tradition of the local and cultures that need\
  \ to be documented. In India, festivals play a significant role in preserving culture.\
  \ Being one of the countries filled with diverse roots of religions, the cultures\
  \ are deeply connected to the religions. In North part of Kerala Theyyam is one\
  \ such tradition. Theyyam is one of the ancient ritual forms of worshipping. Theyyam,\
  \ the word believed to be derived from \"Deivam\" which means God in Malayalam.\
  \ As the name suggests devotees believe the immortal goddess take a mortal form\
  \ to bless the devotees. Even though the concept is not alien in other religions\
  \ or even other regions on India, Theyyam is unique as the people dress up as the\
  \ goddesses wear bright red dress and attachments made of palm leaves. Theyyam gets\
  \ performed across different temples from Nov to April months across Kannur, Kasargode\
  \ & Calicut regions. In each temple, different theyyams are played based on the\
  \ deities & the beliefs. e.g. Puthiyabhagavathi theyyam, covered with fire elements\
  \ symbolizes 2 things- \n1. fire being an element of cleansing means she always\
  \ remains new\n2. Puthiyabhagavathi cleanses all the struggles in life with her\
  \ blessing. \n\nAs a continuation of the cleansing, the final day of the theyyam\
  \ involves walking through the fire- also signifies cleansing. Theyyam and the people\
  \ representing the different castes who carryout theyyam run through the fire with\
  \ new bhagavathi.Every religion or beliefs has its own version of rituals and way\
  \ of worships they may look odd or attractive to others. Theyyam is one such worship\
  \ form in this region which for sure catches your eye and stays with you. Once every\
  \ year, this theyyam happens on specific Malayalam dates."
