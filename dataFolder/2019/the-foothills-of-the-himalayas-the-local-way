Text: "Standing on an isolated mountain peak in Northern most India, home to the highest\
  \ Shiva temple in the world, the sheer vastness of the surrounding Himalayan range\
  \ into neighbouring Nepal stretching as far as the eye could see, I was consumed\
  \ by a feeling I had yet to experience in the chaotic sub-continent \u2013 peace.\n\
  \nI was in disbelief that only 2 days before I had been in India\u2019s overwhelming\
  \ capital city of New Delhi, where the sensory overloads of smells, crowds and intense\
  \ humidity were enough to come as an attack to even the most intrepid of travellers.\n\
  \nIt was from this this bustling metropolis however, that I had found myself taking\
  \ a 7 hour train north to the yoga capital of the world \u2013 Rishikesh. What had\
  \ led me here was a chance encounter with an Indian store owner, a jewellery maker\
  \ himself, who told me of his brother in rural Northern India, who was suffering\
  \ from the lull of off peak season in his small local motorbike rental. \n\nMe,\
  \ having had little experience on 2 wheels aside from ending up with nothing more\
  \ than a sprained ankle and bruised confidence the previous year in Indonesia, was\
  \ sceptical to say the least. I was, however, soon reassured by this jolly man that\
  \ I would be guided by my own driver, stopping whenever and wherever I pleased,\
  \ with homestays, meals and of course \u2013 chai tea, provided along the way. With\
  \ few other plans for the next coming week, I decided to take a leap of faith and\
  \ trust this smiling man dripping in silver jewellery, who seemed only so keen for\
  \ me to meet his extended family in the north.\n\nSo that was how I found myself\
  \ on the familiar Indian railway, settled in to watch the eccentric family life\
  \ of Indian culture that I had grown so accustomed to over the previous month. No\
  \ sooner had I arrived in Rishikesh, I was met by Ashok \u2013 who I can confirm\
  \ was equally as jolly and equally as covered in flashy silver jewellery as his\
  \ Southern brother \u2013 who gave me free range in where I\u2019d like to go and\
  \ what I would like to see along the way. \n\nThis absolute freedom was one of the\
  \ greatest gifts Ashok could have given me; asking simply to see the Himalayan range,\
  \ I was taken on a journey so far removed to what I had ever experienced before.\
  \ Leaving Rishikesh early the next morning, we followed the River Ganges higher\
  \ and higher out of the city, into some of the most breath taking scenery I could\
  \ have imagined. \n\nMy initial discomfort at the thought of travelling on 2 wheels\
  \ soon dissipated as Ashok carefully weaved upwards along roads surrounded by lush\
  \ jungle canopy on one side, and a steep drop to the ever changing colour of the\
  \ Ganges shifting from brown to green to blue and right back to brown again. \n\n\
  Staying in homestays of family friends, greeted like a long lost family member myself,\
  \ I ate like royalty throughout the 3 day trip \u2013 warming dal, freshly baked\
  \ parathas and steaming hot chai seemingly there to accompany us wherever we decided\
  \ to take respite. \n\nHaving the benefit of Ashok\u2019s local knowledge, I was\
  \ informed (amazingly or less so \u2013 you decide) that we were now travelling\
  \ on what had come to be known as \u2018the most dangerous road in the world\u2019\
  \u2026needless to say I could not tell you much about the next hour which I endured\
  \ with my eyes firmly closed.\n\nSurviving this however, we reached our final destination\
  \ of Chopta, a small town \u2013 if you could call a cluster of huts and their protective\
  \ wild dogs a town \u2013 in the foothills of the Himalayas. From here, treks brought\
  \ scenes truly unimaginable to me, snowy peaks, lush jungle home to leopard and\
  \ bear, and finally the most sacred temple to Hindu religion at its highest point.\n\
  \nHaving experienced this journey in such an authentic manner, and it easily becoming\
  \ one of my most valued memories, I therefore have only one bit of parting advice\
  \ \u2013 always trust the smiling man in jewellery."
