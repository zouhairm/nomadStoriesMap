Text: "FRANKFURT AIRPORT (GERMANY), AUGUSTE 2019\n\nShaking... \nMy whole body is\
  \ shaking. \nAnd I am sweating. It feels like \"Water of fear\" is flowing down\
  \ my whole body....\nBut still I want to do it. I am still smiling and looking forward\
  \ to this trip.\nBecause I know: I will meet someone I never met before. It\u2019\
  s really thrilling me....\nThis is pretty obvious; because it has been 9 years now.\n\
  \n\"Don\u2019t forget to skype after you've arrived!\"\n\"No I won't forget mom!\u201C\
  \  I am saying and rolling my eyes a bit. Mom is just making me nervous.....\nBut\
  \ I can't be mad about it.\nI mean: Who wouldn't be exited while your family member\
  \ is traveling thousands of kilometers away?\nSo...I am hugging my parents, saying:\
  \ \n\"See you in three weeks.\"\nAnd then I enter the \"Gate to a different World.\"\
  \n\nIt really feels like a \"different\":\nPeople are dressed in oriental dresses;\
  \ the languages in my ear are becoming stranger. Yeah I even seem to have different\
  \ smells in my nose! Indian smells.....\n\n\"Everything's fine?\"\nI smile reading\
  \ her message. \nAnd reply: \"Yeah, Boarding in 5 minutes. Can't wait Xxx\"\nJust\
  \ a few seconds later I recieve her answer: \"Me too. Have a safe flight!\"\nI am\
  \ smiling...and knowing: I will have!\n\nABOUT 9 HOURS LATER\u2026\nCOLOMBO AIRPORT\
  \ (SRI LANKA)\n\nOh - my -gosh!\nI feel like I am in paradise.\nPalm trees. Women\
  \ in Sari.... and elephants, nearly at every corner...\nI've read that they are\
  \ a symbol for luck around her. So: I should be the luckiest person on earth now.\
  \ \n\n\"I see you already made friends with the elephants!\"\nI know that voice\
  \ behind me.....\nSo I am just turning around, cheering. \n\"SAJTYYY!!!!\"\n\nIt\
  \ is still so unbelievable. But it is true!!!  She is standing in front of me!\n\
  I am meeting my penpal -who became more friend than a 'pal'. After 10 years of writing\
  \ letters. I am meeting Sajty (by the way: her full name is \"Sajani\"- but I gave\
  \ her this nickname, which she really liked)!!!\nWithin a few seconds I really feel\
  \ the elephants energy.\nI am the happiest and luckiest person of the world!\nBut\
  \ I can't enjoy it for long because we really got to go now.\n\nWhile leaving the\
  \ airports area with her sisters\u2019 car Sajani and I listen to some local music...\n\
  Did you know that music can put you to the clouds and make you fly??\nI didn't.\
  \ Until I heard these sounds\u2026\n\"I can't believe you haven\u2019t heard these\
  \ kinda music before\"; Sajty sais.\n\"Me too. I missed so many clouds! \", I say\
  \ and we start laughing.\n\n\"But so: you want to have twenty one days full of adventures...?\"\
  , Sajty is asking.\n\"YEAH OF COURSE!!\", I reply as excited as a child on Christmas\
  \ Day. \nSajty is smiling and says: \"Ok. Then let's go...\"\nTO BE CONTINUED...;-)"
