Text: "\u201CThere.\u201D The white-haired farmer gestures up the steep, terraced\
  \ vineyard toward the top of the hill looming before us. He\u2019s equipped for\
  \ this dreary rain: Well-worn, weatherproofed boots and a long jacket. Beads of\
  \ water gather on the slick fabric and slide down to the grass where we stand. \u201C\
  That\u2019s where the boars were rooting through our grapes.\u201D His arm sweeps\
  \ along the length of the narrow rail weaving between rows of plantings, tracing\
  \ the vast vertical distance. He\u2019d used a monorail to bring the bodies down\
  \ after he and his neighbors went hunting for \u2013 and found \u2013 the scavenging\
  \ wildlife. \u201CYou could see the trail of blood on the ground,\u201D he goes\
  \ on in accented English. \u201CBut the boars \u2013 they were too big to carry\
  \ by hand.\u201D He shakes his head. It would be a fool\u2019s errand, he seems\
  \ to imply. The hillsides are simply too steep. \n\nIt\u2019s shoulder season here.\
  \ I\u2019m in Vernazza, one of the five famed towns of the Cinque Terre. But instead\
  \ of lounging by the harbor, espresso in hand, or skirting the coast on well-trod\
  \ hiking trails, I\u2019m tucked back from the soon-to-be bustling main street.\
  \ Visitors mostly ignore this side of the train station. A few homes and cellars\
  \ peter off into a lonely route snaking up, up through folding hills. A river parallels\
  \ its path several meters below. Some parts, like where we stand now, are terraced\
  \ with walls and wooden stakes draped with grape vines. Other patches are less well\
  \ kept, the thick, wild brush taking over, the remains of ancient stonewalls sliding\
  \ towards the riverbed below. These narrow terraces make habitable once inhospitable\
  \ terrain. The vines themselves bear grapes for the sweet sciacchetr\xE0 wine that,\
  \ in many ways, lies at the heart of this part of the Ligurian Coast.\n\nMy host\
  \ is one of a dwindling number of vintners who have devoted themselves to keeping\
  \ alive the old connections to these hills. With increased interest and tourism\
  \ following both the Cinque Terre\u2019s designation as Italy\u2019s first National\
  \ Park in 1999, then later, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, also came the increasing\
  \ abandonment of traditional viticulture and farming techniques. In its place rose\
  \ guest rooms, restaurants, and souvenir shops. This shift towards the coast has\
  \ led to plots of family land, once tended regularly, being reclaimed by nature.\
  \ And with that return to wilderness, the walls which once so carefully provided\
  \ the backbone for habitation on these steep hillsides have crumbled, too. \n\n\
  While it might be easy to bemoan such changes, the situation here is -- as most\
  \ are -- a bit more complex. The Cinque Terre were historically a deeply isolated\
  \ area, five towns perched on a dramatic coastline nearly impossible to reach except\
  \ by water. \u201CLife was hard,\u201D my host tells me. As we now stand outside\
  \ his cellar, a shiny new BMW drives by. We wait for it to pass before he continues.\
  \ \u201CThe grandmothers remember going to bed hungry at night. After carrying baskets\
  \ up and down these hills all day\u2026\u201D He trails off. Food came from the\
  \ sea or was cultivated in small vegetable patches. Grapes were grown for wine,\
  \ and also their dense roots that kept the soil of each terrace level together.\
  \ While increased tourist dollars has led to full bellies, it has also meant that\
  \ as each member of the oldest generation passes away, a newly renovated set of\
  \ guest rooms appears; a garden or vineyard goes untended; and the specialized knowledge\
  \ of how to work with this land disappears. Many day-trippers are blind to this\
  \ long history. They instead stick to the shoreline, seeking an iconic selfie by\
  \ Vernazza\u2019s harbor, unaware of the value of a single glass of wine.\n\nAs\
  \ I thank my host for showing me around his family\u2019s vineyard, I can\u2019\
  t help but wonder what the future holds for these towns. It seems a world apart\
  \ between the main street and those for whom this land is \u2013 and has been \u2013\
  \ their family\u2019s home. The local viticulture cooperative has taken it upon\
  \ themselves to not the let old ways completely die. Wine, here, is more than a\
  \ way of life \u2013 it holds the land together. But for how much longer, I don\u2019\
  t know."
