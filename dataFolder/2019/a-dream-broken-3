Text: "It wasn't her home. At first glance, she could be deceived. The same alleyways\
  \ that would take her to the market. The route to school, the pond, the houses where\
  \ she'd run into to play hide and seek. The place where she grew up. From a distance,\
  \ she could say it looked all the same, but up close my mom could not be deceived.\
  \ This was no longer her home.\n\nAll my life my mom had boasted about Bangladesh\
  \ as if it were her own little child. The most beautiful sky in the world. My mom\u2019\
  s blanket on sultry summer nights. The air cuddling against her as she whispered\
  \ sweet little secrets into her sisters\u2019 ears. The ponds, where she would go\
  \ with her friends to take a bath, fresh water lapping against her skin. The festivals\
  \ of Durga Puja, when the whole community would burst into joy. My mom in her brand\
  \ new dress, dancing to the beat of the dhol with her friends, forgetting in the\
  \ moment of pure happiness that someday these would be her most cherished memories.\
  \ \n\nBangladesh was her perfect child with the most perfect grades. It was beyond\
  \ perfection; for her it was the heaven she longed to return to. Fast forward, fourteen\
  \ years later she came back to her perfect child only to find she had become a drug\
  \ addict. Corruption flew through her veins. Every person triggered at the name\
  \ of religion, pistol aimed and ready to shoot at any moment. The most purest waters\
  \ that had glistened with pride were tainted with the slur of garbage, mud, and\
  \ who knows what else. The festivals, the joy, and the sense of community all seemed\
  \ to have disappear, buried away by a. sourness. \n\nEvery face was sour. Every\
  \ person had problems and everyone thought we were a solution. Our family greeted\
  \ us with open arms. It was later on we realized that their hands were open as well\
  \ for a reason. Their smiles, laughter, and kindness was all their for a reason.\
  \ We were the solution because to them it seemed logical as we were foreigners.\
  \ We were the gateway to the luxuries they could only dream of. Their mentality\
  \ made me feel stranded. I always had this hope that whatever happens in New York\
  \ I have a family in Bangladesh that would care if something would happen to me.\
  \ I wish I hadn't found out how vain their kindness truly is. That their must be\
  \ a give and take. Give me a hug today and I'll make sure to send a thousand dollars\
  \ during the holidays. There was a bribery taking place and I didn't want any part\
  \ of it. I just wanted someone to care about me, for once, but everyone saw me by\
  \ where I came from not who I was. \n\nAt the foreground of this bribery was my\
  \ grandmother. My grandmother, the one I had wanted to know the most, had changed.\
  \ The loving stories did not resemble her anymore. She'd grown bitter and selfish.\
  \ Even at the sight of her daughter who had been gone for fourteen years, her eyes\
  \ did not shift from her eldest son. Whatever feel under the shadow of my grandmother,\
  \ she'd give it to her son whether it be a gift or money. The giving tree never\
  \ shifted from my uncle. My mom could see this wanting to say something, but what\
  \ could she say to a mother that no longer saw her, but a lottery full of money?\
  \  \n\nIn one trip, my mom and I lost our home. It was hard to accept, especially\
  \ for my mom. For months, she'd ponder how could a place she had loved so much change\
  \ so drastically. I'll never be able to give her an answer. For now, all I can do\
  \ is hold her hand and be grateful that we have each other to understand. We don't\
  \ have much, but we have a home here in a small apartment in NYC. Although, it can\
  \ never compare to the vastness of family connections in Bangladesh, my home here\
  \ will always comfort me and I hope someday it will do the same for my mom."
