Text: "Especially when travelling to countries that are known to the outside for their\
  \ rather vague system of authorities you often get tips from friends like \u201A\
  ..and never stop for the cops!\u2018 Well, and here we are, on a dark straight road\
  \ in the East of SriLanka after a long day of great surf and or or the other degustation\
  \ of local bush produce. The Tuktuk that I\u2018m driving is running in 4th gear-\
  \ maximum speed, my girlfriend Teresa is holding herself in the back with both hands\
  \ on the bars that seperate driver from passenger and as I look in one of my oversized\
  \ rear mirrors I see a light flashing up on the horizon behind and slowly but steady\
  \ getting bigger and bigger. Earlier that day after returning from a rather remote\
  \ surfbreak two hours south in a Nationalpark, Benji the guy that we hired our Tuk\
  \ from asked me to stop in the slightly dodgy tourist town of Arugam Bay to switch\
  \ rides as he thought to take out a bigger comission subleasing us one of these\
  \ threewheelers from one of his other buddies. As we arrive at set of dawn, our\
  \ friend the small town hussler already awaits us in a small Kottu shop. \u201A\
  Sure, we buy you dinner, but where is the other Tuk?\u2018 I ask. \u201AComing,\
  \ coming, \u2018 assures us our small but stirdy friend still wearing his peji on\
  \ the back of his head from Friday prayers. We all have a plate of the fried national\
  \ dish:  Imagine a stack of pencakes cut in thin slices, stirfried together with\
  \ onions, carrot, cabbage and occasionally cheese. Definitly serving a hungry stomach\
  \ after a day in the ocean very well. After we finish our meal and Benji has himself\
  \ invited to another Pepsi , we\u2018re slowly getting itchy feet. Still having\
  \ almost an hour of rugged road and dirt pathes in front of us back to our idyllic\
  \ homestay far out of town on another beach we remember the warnings that with the\
  \ setting sun bigger creatures awake which we would not necessarily want to encounter\
  \ alone on a small road by night. As soon as you land in Sri Lanka, you will see\
  \ them slendering the endless seeming meadows and swamplands: Asian Elephants. \u201A\
  Benji, we need to go!\u2018 \u201AOh yes yes, tuk tuk coming.\u2018 And after yet\
  \ another two angry sounding phone calls our new ride areives shining bright with\
  \ its Pirates of the Carribean decals and chromed fake exhaust. So finally we load\
  \ my 9ft longboard and another stack of shorties on the coach and take off. As we\
  \ pass the long bridge connecting Arugam with the local capital of Portuvil two\
  \ flashlights shine up flaring bright into my eyes. Pictures of being beaten up\
  \ in the surf a couple of days before by a mob of local youngsters flash up in my\
  \ mind and I hit the gaspedal shooting straight past them. We pass the market and\
  \ laugh historically probably also to get rid of our bad conscience just having\
  \ speeded away from authorities. Bonny & Clyde mode on. I turn to Teresa in the\
  \ back as yet another pair of nervous moving lights hit us and I realise we just\
  \ ran past another controle stop. The dry sound of one of the policemen hitting\
  \ the side of our vehicle in anger hits the adrenalin switch back on to full throttle.\
  \ We finally realize that we might actually get into serious trouble here and I\
  \ drive as fast as I can hoping for a lazy attitude of the cops and to disappear\
  \ in the dark of the long meadow we are about to cross on this straight well build\
  \ stretch of asphalt also called \u201AElephant road\u2018. Silence, darkness and\
  \ a fresh breeze kick in to calm our nerves. We switch the music on and lower the\
  \ speed to normal as I look back and almost get a heart attack. They are after us,\
  \ in full speed a Honda with two uniformed men, aggressively weaving to the side.\
  \ Faster as I can think they take over as I realise one is even carrying a machine\
  \ gun. We give up and stop... to be continued"
