Text: 'I have never been outside my state . It was my first time to go to another
  country . I know you might me thinking why I''m even writing this if I have not
  even travelled in my own land .I know I''m not a passionate writer but I love traveling
  in my dreams that came true  . I was doing my masters . Finally I stepped out of
  my shell and I went to Pakistan in 2014 .My first ever journey! It was so long that
  it took almost a day but for me it was like a fraction of seconds because I was
  so much absorbed with the beauty of nature .The fresh air is still running through
  my blood giving me the chill . It was not different from my own world but the freedom
  I felt make me clear that I''m not I a close bound shell anymore.Finally when I
  reached the destination I was overwhelmed by the people I love .It was late night
  and i finally I retired to bed .In the early morning I had my breakfast and we started
  our journey towards a mountain Pir Chinasi which is a shrine and tourist destination
  located 30 kilometers (19 mi) east of Muzaffarabad city on the top of hills at an
  elevation of 2,900 metres (9,500 ft).I actually had acrophobia but I don''t know
  why I was calm on that very day,may be the beauty of greenish layer had already
  mesmerized me enough that I was not able to know that I''m on top of the world.when
  I reached there we had a cup of coffee there which was so refreshing .I took the
  pictures there and finally I came back to my senses when I saw that I was on top
  of something and I can''t look down because I was not able to see anything as it
  was covered with clouds .So my dream of flying with the clouds came true .I shut
  my eyes so that my dream will not vanish .

  The end

  P.s :I don''t know if this page is a fake or I might not be able to achieve my dreams
  but still I wanted to give it a try.

  Yours sincerely

  A girl that is bound to remain in a shell'
