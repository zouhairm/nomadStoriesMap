Text: "\"The next step you take could be the best step of your life or it's a straight\
  \ fall to death\" I told myself while trekking to the highest point of  the mesmourous\
  \ solang valley's snowy peak. The first time i ever dared to take a solo trip. I\
  \ have always been a shy, introvert and i never had many friends and one fine day\
  \ i decided to take this leap of faith. I was also very healthy and trekking was\
  \ something i had never done.  \n         This trip started from Mumbai and I took\
  \ a train shataabdi express to another Delhi!  Everything was confusing at first\
  \ when i got down at nizzamuddin station.  The best part about solo trips is you\
  \ never know what's coming.  At first i thought how am i so crazy? Who on this earth\
  \ just leaves for a solo TREK!!!  Without even trekked before. Yes you know now\
  \ how crazy i am.  So i was supposed to board a bus from delhi to manali but the\
  \ mouth- watering smell of the famous 'Chhole-Bhature' stopped me and my further\
  \ actions. After finishing the delicious meal i went on to find the bus i was supposed\
  \ to board. I finally found it after struggling for 20 mins. \n                \
  \ All the passengers in that bus were travelling to manali. And it was a journey\
  \ of 24 hours.  But it wasn't scary to me because i had my music and my books. So\
  \ the bus was about to leave and a guy came running to board the bus - he was late.\
  \ His seat was right beside me so he came and made himself comfortable.  I watched.\
  \ I lowkey found him cute.  \" Focus ishita, on your book,  focus\" i told myself.\
  \  few hours passed by no interaction took place, the bus stopped for a tea break.\
  \  And i love chai!  The mesmerising aroma of the mixture of mint leaves, cardamom,\
  \ ginger, lemon grass always gets to me.  So i got down and figured that he also\
  \ loves tea. And since then our conversation started and guess what it never ended\
  \ till we reached manali.  Turned out that we were so similar yet different. Similar\
  \ choices of books, music, cuisine and so much more.  But he was extremely extrovert\
  \ and i was the opposite. The solo trip was solo no more as i met the ' stranger'\
  \ oh, forgot to tell you his name was Ranbir.  \n                   We reached manali\
  \ in the evening and tents were where he had to sleep the night. We slept well that\
  \ night and next morning we began to trek to the 2nd base camp and then the 3rd\
  \ and then the 4th and few days passed by and finally the snow clad peak.  I was\
  \ freaked out but it was one of my dreams to reach the top of the Solang peak. \
  \ And as for a first timer it was my greatest achievement. Ranbir and I trekked\
  \ up the steep valley to reach the snow.After risking our lives, struggling mentally\
  \ and physically we reached the peak.  We played in snow, and did sliding on our\
  \ ponchos, it was amazing. It was one of the best trips of my life.  We started\
  \ heading down and this one risky step could have made my life or my death was my\
  \ next step.  And i took a leap of faith and i almost slipped but he immediately,\
  \ reflexively held me. I was hanging down the steep valley, almost dead and this\
  \ one stranger turned friend over the days saved my life! And that was THE MOMENT\
  \ of my life.  He asked me \" would you like to hold my hand for the rest of your\
  \ life?\" I was scared, freaked out, literally hanging on death and his question\
  \ shocked me, surprised me, astonished me,  but i knew my answer, yes i wanted him,\
  \ i wanted him from the moment i saw him, i wanted these adventures with him. So\
  \ i said \"yes!!!  Now bring me up before i die\"  and this was our beautiful trek\
  \ to manali.  Not only did i do a solo trek and completed it but i also found the\
  \ love of my life.Today we are married for 7 years now."
