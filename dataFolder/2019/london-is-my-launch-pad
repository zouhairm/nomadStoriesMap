Text: "\u201CRumore\u201D is the Italian word for \u201Cnoise\u201D and it\u2019s\
  \ also the name of a music magazine created in Turin in 1992. I have its 325th number\
  \ in my hands, the cover is black and the main article is dedicated to the unforgettable\
  \ Manchester-based band Joy Division. Formed in 1976, the band has made the history\
  \ of music but its history ended tragically when the lead singer Ian Curtis committed\
  \ suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.\nI could write the longest essay about Joy Division\u2019\
  s history and inheritance but I\u2019m in London, I\u2019m staying here for a few\
  \ days and I can\u2019t miss to visit the Britannia Row Studios, the record studios\
  \ where Joy Division recorded their second and final studio album \u201CCloser\u201D\
  . The studios were originally built in 1975 by the rock-band Pink Floyd and they\
  \ were used for recordings by musical geniuses such as Bj\xF6rk, Pete Doherty and\
  \ indeed, Joy Division.\n\nI\u2019m on the Victoria Line which goes from south London\
  \ to north-east London. It\u2019s colored light blue on the Tube map and for a particular\
  \ coincidence is the same metro line that takes you to Brixton, the district where\
  \ the \u201Cthin white duke\u201D David Bowie grew up. An old woman is sitting in\
  \ front of me, she\u2019s got pink hair and a pretty unconventional pink scarf.\
  \ Next to me a young boy is reading a fantasy book. I can see he\u2019s totally\
  \ into what he\u2019s reading and he\u2019s probably spending his journey on another\
  \ planet. I like looking at people and taking a guess about who they are, what they\
  \ do and what they might think about me.\nThe metro has just arrived at Highbury\
  \ & Islington station and I need to get off. The Britannia Row Studios is just one\
  \ of the incredible amount of places that have made London a Mecca for musicians\
  \ and artists. Can you imagine that the Abbey Road album from Beatles was recorded\
  \ in this city? That Jimmy Hendrix used to live here? Not to mention Sid Vicious,\
  \ Eric Clapton or Amy Winehouse.\n\nIt\u2019s a rainy day in Britannia Row Street,\
  \ the sky is white and gray and I can\u2019t think of a better place to be than\
  \ right here. Red-brick buildings everywhere, left-hand traffic and then me: \u201C\
  phenomenal cosmic power in a itty bitty living space\u201D. I know I\u2019ll find\
  \ nothing more than an apartment building, The Britannia Row Studios were sold to\
  \ private investors a while ago but that\u2019s not the point. I\u2019ve dreamt\
  \ about coming to London since I was a little girl, I grew up in the smallest town\
  \ ever and boredom is probably the more suitable word to describe my teens. I\u2019\
  ve always wondered what it would be like to live in a lively, multicultural and\
  \ dynamic city and now I\u2019m here, in London, in front of a building that once\
  \ was a record studio and now it\u2019s just a house. A nice house I have to admit,\
  \ but still a house.\n\nTruth is that I\u2019m here, in a residential district of\
  \ London, contemplating one of the most ordinary building I\u2019ve ever looked\
  \ at. An unnecessary fanaticism that still makes me feel like I\u2019m exactly where\
  \ I want to be. Joy Division are playing their post-punk music in my headphones\
  \ and there\u2019s literally nobody around. I close my eyes and I start dancing\
  \ quietly. Suddenly, I\u2019m back in the small bedroom of my family house, crying\
  \ over a broken heart and trying to run away from my unbearable hometown, meanwhile\
  \ Ian Curtis says: \u201Cand she gave away the secrets of her past / and said I\u2019\
  ve lost control again / and a voice that told her when and where to act / she said\
  \ I\u2019ve lost control again\u201D. I\u2019m finally feeling at ease, not needing\
  \ to dye my hair as an act of rebellion, not needing anger and self-sabotage, reacting\
  \ and making things happen is more important than escaping from myself. I can make\
  \ peace with my past and find my own imperfect way to achieve everything I desire,\
  \ London is my launch pad."
