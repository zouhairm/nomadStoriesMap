Text: "A place that left a path on you will also always have a piece of you, it means\
  \ you smile when you remember the moments you spent there, it means you have a connection\
  \ that will never end. Visit Santa Marta was better than what I expected, the forest,\
  \ the ocean, the magic and surrealist landscapes and its happy people made me see\
  \ life from another perspective, the ability of the people of be happy and grateful\
  \ regardless their situation made me think in life in a deeper way, walking trough\
  \ the forest in the Tayrona\u2019s park is the perfect combination of connection,\
  \ peace and surprise, I had mixed feelings during those hours of bright sunshine,\
  \ green nature and amazing beaches that surround the mountain, I arrived to the\
  \ place by bus, the party started there: music, hot weather and happy people that\
  \ spread you with their energy, there were two hours from the city of Santa Marta,\
  \ I went alone but in just two hours I already had travel partners that would make\
  \ me see the place from their point of view. The journey began: we started walking\
  \ from the heart of the mountain, everything was a combination of adventure and\
  \ nature, we had to walk over the forest and climb some parts of the mountain sometimes\
  \ it was hard but the view was worthy, every step I took was filling me with energy,\
  \ I was surrounded by sun, lots of green and amazing landscapes that made me wonder\
  \ if I was in the earth yet, after one hour we were in the first stop, one of the\
  \ several beaches of the Tayrona to have lunch in front of the beach, it was a small\
  \ hut with tables in the sand attended by warm local people that made me feel like\
  \ home, the food was amazing and it was time to continue our walk, our final destiny\
  \ was the most famous beach of the place, the Cabo San Juan, just arriving there\
  \ and I was amazed with the spot, the gold sand and the blue ocean combined with\
  \ the forest behind made me live the present and be able to stay with all my senses\
  \ there, we spend the rest of the day dancing, swimming and just being happy, finally\
  \ I left the place in a boat with an amazing sunset behind me, surely one of my\
  \ best days. The best trips are those that change your life by just changing a piece\
  \ of your mind, and that, that is establish a local connection."
