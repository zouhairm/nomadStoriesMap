Text: "The old man driving the tuk-tuk has a grin that is mostly broken brown teeth\
  \ and fleshy gums, a small chuckle accompanies his smile whenever he speaks like\
  \ funny punctuation marks. Linzay and I waved him down after locals scattered from\
  \ the beach, the shop owners slamming their doors shut. Sensing the immediacy, we\
  \ shoulder tapped a local shopkeeper who's answer was simple, yet terrifying. \"\
  Tsunami warning.\"\n\nWhen we told the driver this he let go an honest laugh, his\
  \ long grey pony tail whipping in the breeze. \n\u201CThe sea will go out 1 kilometer\
  \ before Tsunami\u201D He said with confidence. \n\u201CYeah, but we want to be\
  \ 1 kilometer inland when that happens!\u201D I yell over the tiny engine. \nNervously,\
  \ we watched the bay, as the fishermen in their bright long-tail boats headed off\
  \ for deeper water. \n\nBy the time we reached our hotel the Tuk Tuk driver had\
  \ calmed my nerves. Let's update our facebook so no one is worried, I suggested\
  \ to Linzay. Half-way though her message we hear a dreaded whirring noise.\n\nThe\
  \ Tsunami warning system blaired with an eerie effect. Linz glanced at me with panic\
  \ as we bolted to our room. \u201CJust grab the essentials\u201D I yell to her.\
  \ \u201CWhat essentials?!\u201D she yelled back. Good point, what do you take for\
  \ this? A submarine? A helicopter? How much time do we even have?\n\nI clear the\
  \ minibar of water and beer, grab my journal, camera, backpack and with that we\
  \ headed for higher ground.\n\nThe street was a chaotic mix of tourists and hotels\
  \ workers. People simply pointed to the towering limestone hills, so we headed that\
  \ direction. I could only think of every disaster since the dawn of man.\n\nAbruptly,\
  \ the road ends at the newly built Mercure Hotel. By the time I turned around to\
  \ look for another route, some 20 odd people where following us. \n\u201CWhere do\
  \ we go now!?\u201D yelled one of them demandingly. \n\u201CI guess up!\u201D I\
  \ yell back, deciding right there that I didn't want to be the emergency tour guide.\n\
  \nA towering thunderstorm is started to build overhead. Thick, black clouds crept\
  \ over the sun.\n\nAlmost naturally, people gathered into groups on the main floor\
  \ and started to make small talk. I recognised the look on their faces, from my\
  \ years as a teenage lifeguard. They reminded of a drowning person right before\
  \ they go under. Plain, cold panic, and rumours float around the room in a tapestry\
  \ of different languages. A dull waiting had begun.\n\nThe streets are empty as\
  \ the sky begins to crack under a thunderous deluge. A few stragglers are literally\
  \ heading for the hills, but with the lightening chasing them into the jungle. We\
  \ decide to climb to the 4th floor.\n\nIn my head I laugh at how math has suddenly\
  \ become applicable. \nRob, my newly minted emergency buddy, and I do some quick\
  \ calculations to see if we are high enough. \nImagine if you found yourself looking\
  \ at this question on a grade nine test-\nYou are trying to excape a Tsunami. A\
  \ Mag 8.0 earthquake will produce a 7 meter wave, with one meter for every 1.0 after\
  \ that. You are trying to escape a 8.9 and are 4 floors up. Do you survive?\n\n\
  With a small group of others we reach the top floor. Mothers and Childern are crying.\
  \ Someone put their skinny 10-year-old in a bright orange life-vest, naturally he's\
  \ all hysteric's, which is only made worse when the power cuts out and we're sitting\
  \ in the dark.\n\nNot knowing what else to do I unleash the beer in my pack, don\
  \ some fancy hotel slippers and attempt small talk.\n\nI offer everyone who looks\
  \ interested (and old enough) some beer. Next, we start to play paper games with\
  \ the kids. We try to invite the other kids but their parents are still whispering\
  \ them goodbyes.\n\nFor the next 4 or 5 hours we post up in a room with 10 guests\
  \ as the sky murders the ground with lightening and rain. No power and No wave ever\
  \ came. Also, I drank all the beer.\n\nThe old man in the Tuk Tuk was right."
