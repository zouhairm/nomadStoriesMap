Text: "Out of clear skies, we descend onto the airstrip, unrolled like a short black\
  \ carpet among the Himalayan peaks. Simikot\u2019s airport and village marks the\
  \ end of one world and the beginning of another: a place without roads, cars, or\
  \ telephone wires. Our bags are tossed from the bush plane onto the tarmac. Military\
  \ personnel check trekking permits at a chain-link fence and let us through. We\
  \ share the stone streets of the village with mules, yellow-eyed sheep and brown\
  \ hens that scatter ahead of our boots. \n\tA day ago Kathmandu\u2019s Airport,\
  \ Yeshi and I were joined by Shalav, an NGO program officer accompanying us into\
  \ Humla for sustainable development assessments, and Gokul, our mountain guide.\
  \ Our party of four is headed for the village of Yalbang that sits only some 25\
  \ km away by air, but a three-day walk by foot. \u201CHumla is only now opening\
  \ up to the outside world,\u201D Yeshi had told me over pumpkin curry and roti during\
  \ our first night in the capital. \u201CBut with next to nothing to export, the\
  \ impoverished villages of the province face major sustainability issues.\u201D\n\
  \tThe trail coils from ridge to valley and back up again. Squat mountain horses\
  \ carry our bags out of Simikot as we move from stone, to pine forests, to low-growing\
  \ deciduous trees where roaming goats gather. We take a moment\u2019s rest a tea\
  \ house \u2014 a local\u2019s home offering instant coffee or butter tea in exchange\
  \ for some hundred rupees. We sit outside and sip from tin cups. The pines stir\
  \ as a breeze fills the air with dust. On the bench next to me, a boy of about five\
  \ stares intently. Gokul mentions that he must only rarely see people like me. His\
  \ hands and cheeks are cracked dry by the elements. Unable to communicate, I offer\
  \ him gum, and soon realize that he does not know what it is.\n\tOn a footbridge\
  \ adorned with faded prayer flags, we cross the Karnali's clay-coloured waters:\
  \ Nepal\u2019s longest tributary originating all the way from the Tibetan plateau.\
  \ Passing a Hindu village, the children run out excitedly, some eager to test their\
  \ schoolbook English on us while others, especially the youngest, yell for sweets,\
  \ a call on the air that rings chock-late! I take it as a sign that they are not\
  \ all so unaccustomed to white visitors. One girl comes to to me and asks for something\
  \ I need help in translating. \u201CA pen,\u201D Shalav clarifies. \u201CShe\u2019\
  s asking for a pen.\u201D I strike a deal with her: \u201CA pen for a portrait.\u201D\
  \n\n\tOn day two, thunder rolls in black clouds at our backs, filling the valley\u2019\
  s corridor before eventually overtaking us.  We get soaked before finding shelter\
  \ in another tea house with but one small window offering dim rain-light. By the\
  \ glow of embers, we discuss this changing province. Yeshi tells me about the road\
  \ China is building into Humla from the north. A road wide enough for cars that\
  \ will bring trade, jobs, widespread electricity and technology. \n\tThese thoughts\
  \ follow me later, and from them sprouts an unexpected sadness as we approach the\
  \ village of Kermi, at the sight of a woman standing beside her black cow in a barley\
  \ field. Noticing us, she brings her palms together and smiles a \u201Cnamaste.\u201D\
  \ Behind her, a cluster of homes of hand-piled rocks, their beams and window frames\
  \ carved by the local carpenter from timber cut in these slopes. What becomes of\
  \ it all, I wonder, when the new road unwinds through these mountains, connecting\
  \ these villages to the world\u2019s largest producing and consuming country?\n\t\
  Grey doves sweep the sky of our third morning. At the Yalbang school gates, a group\
  \ of students stand waiting for us in the rain, white silk Khatas folded across\
  \ their upturned palms. We bow before each of them as they place the delicate scarves\
  \ around our necks in the ceremonial Tibetan motion of welcome. \n\tI smile my thanks,\
  \ my mind replaying Yeshi\u2019s words when I had confessed to him my reluctance\
  \ in seeing all development projects as positive. \u201CBut these people are not\
  \ museum pieces, Liam,\u201D he\u2019d said. \u201CThey only want a normal life.\u201D"
