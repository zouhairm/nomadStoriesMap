Text: "As I look out the glass panes, I see a glowing sphere rising slowly in the\
  \ distance. Sunbeams fly out of its sides; it illuminates the small town and shades\
  \ the horizon. A beautiful gradient shortly commences, flourishing into a vivid\
  \ painting with each passing moment. Soon enough, my eyes rest upon a radiant sky.\n\
  What a great way to start the day.\nNot long after, I make my way outside. In the\
  \ town I am residing in, there is a large and lively gem: a street market.  \nI\
  \ stroll down a brick paved pathway, and soon enter an alleyway full of vivacity\
  \ and energy. The warm morning has clued residents to their terrace for a sip of\
  \ tea. The fresh greens and juicy fruits fill up the outdoor market ambience. Gardeners\
  \ tend to their vegetables, making sure nothing seems out of line and every leaf\
  \ is perfect. A baker emerges from the wooden door of his bakery with a water pot\
  \ in hand and waters his flowering pots. There\u2019s a limitless amount of vendors\
  \ selling antique and eye-catching jewelry and clothes. \nAs I stride down the same\
  \ road I have sauntered across countless of times, bakers are quick to offer me\
  \ a piece of freshly baked, delicious French baguette. Gardeners offer me garden-fresh\
  \ greens to nibble on. Others smile at me as I struggle to make it through the street\
  \ without stopping at every other vendor.\nThis street is like none other; it\u2019\
  s an exhilarating outdoor market setting with a slice of social life. Folks are\
  \ always friendly and deliver kindness as they ask me about my morning, my plans\
  \ for the day, or even crack a joke.\nThis lazily winding path is a familiarity\
  \ to many, and awe-inspiring to new-comers. It\u2019s a pathway that encapsulates\
  \ a rustic charm with an exciting modernity. Somehow, this place certainly does\
  \ not grow old. It exudes a feeling of home and offers a luxurious, yet comforting\
  \ vibe\u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. \nI discovered this street market\
  \ many years ago. However, it is always the same: never changing and forever more.\
  \ As I slowly make my way down the alleyway, I do not look behind me. Partially\
  \ because I fear I will turn back around to discover another tiny shop and will\
  \ not arrive home before the sun sets. More so, because I am determined to keep\
  \ walking forward; I never know what new discovery I will stumble upon down the\
  \ street today.\nNevertheless, I will walk the same path again tomorrow. For a missed\
  \ opportunity today, it will present itself tomorrow. The cycle does not end as\
  \ I will walk through this path again and rediscover\u2026"
