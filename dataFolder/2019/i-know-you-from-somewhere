Text: "Alphonce de Lamartine once said:\"If one had but a single glance to give the\
  \ world, one should gaze on Istanbul.\" So i decided to gaze on this beautiful city\
  \ as much as I could. One evenning, as I was wandering around , knowing that \"\
  not all those who wander are lost\", I arrived to Sultan Ahmet square, I stopped\
  \ to catch my breath, I looked up. The sky was dark, the stars were bright, and\
  \ for a second there, I felt so lucky to be a part of this majestic view. \n   \
  \ I sat down on one of those beautiful brown benches. A girl ,next to me, was sketching\
  \ something on paper, I could not tell what it was , but she kept looking at  this\
  \ man who sat right across from us . I felt curious, so I approached her. The girl\
  \ was about thirteen, she had old clothes , she looked so cold, yet she didn't stop\
  \ sketching . She only  had a pencil and few papers, but I could feel that they\
  \ were all she needed. I saluted her, but she didn't say anything she just nodded.\
  \ I said \"what are you sketching , can I take a look?\" she smiled and handed me\
  \ the paper.  Her drawing felt dark, scary, and surprisingly  fascinating. As I\
  \ suspected, she was sketching the face of the man who sat across from us. I could\
  \ tell it was him eventhough he was sitting four or five benches away . What was\
  \ weird is how many details were on that sketch ! his eybrows, his sad eyes, his\
  \ dark beard. I was wondering: How could she notice all those details ? The man\
  \ was sitting twenty feet away from us!  \n   I asked her \"can I keep the sketch\
  \ a bit longer ? \" She didn't understand . She replied in Arabic \"If you want\
  \ it , you can keep it. I already have one ... in my memory.\" I smiled. I held\
  \ the sketch, and walked slowly  towards the man across from us. I got a bit close\
  \ to him. I could see his face clearly. That sketch was a photograph! I was amazed\
  \ by her  strength of sight! It was almost impossible to sketch a face twenty feet\
  \ away with that much detail and accuracy ! \n  The man with the dark beard and\
  \ sad eyes noticed me. I smiled and said hello. He replied in Arabic \"you don't\
  \ seem Turkish, you can talk in Arabic, I am Syrian ! \" I replied :\" you made\
  \ it real easy for me ! Can I show  you something ?\" he nodded yes . I handed him\
  \ the sketch saying \" I believe this is you !\"  He held the sketch with a trembling\
  \ hand and stared at it for quite some time. He got up and walked slowly towards\
  \ that little girl. He gave her the sketch and said:\"this is yours, you can have\
  \ it back.\" The girl held the sketch and  smiled.\n   I stood there not knowing\
  \ what to do . I didn't understand what just happened before my eyes. The man with\
  \ the beard was not surprised at all by seeing that sketch. He turned to me and\
  \ said \" war can destroy a lot of things; countries,nations, buildings, families,\
  \ but it can never destroy memories.\" \nHe continued: \" She dosen't remember her\
  \ name or her roots, but she never forgot my face.\" \n   I just stood there, staring\
  \ at this stranger who bursted into tears in front of me I said \"who is she ? \"\
  \ He replied with a sad voice : \" She's my daughter.\""
