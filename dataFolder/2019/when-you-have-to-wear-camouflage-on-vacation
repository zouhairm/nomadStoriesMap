Text: "Medical tourism is a thriving industry in India set to reach $9 billion in\
  \ profits in 2020. Unlike those tourists, the original intention of my trip was\
  \ not to seek medical treatment. Instead, I was on a typical tourist Christmas family\
  \ trip: the only thing missing was the Hawaiian shirt.  I am a corporate attorney\
  \ who was ready to play travel journalist in India. I pictured myself as Indiana\
  \ Jones looking to document my adventure of this beautiful country for all of Instagram\
  \ to see.\n\nThis trip felt exciting. A new adventure before I uprooted my life\
  \ in Venezuela to pursue a master's degree in Boston. We had spent the morning touring\
  \ the Taj Mahal and were set to leave Agra on an extremely overcrowded train. As\
  \ the tallest in the group, I had to store the bags for my fellow travelers in the\
  \ very few remaining overhead compartments. In a second of distraction, the train\
  \ suddenly stopped, and I noticed that one of the bags was going to fall on top\
  \ of an unsuspecting woman. Trying to be the hero I\u2019ve always wanted to be,\
  \ I stood with an outstretched arm trying to hold the bag back, but then, I heard\
  \ and felt it. Like a cracker after being sat on, all in an instant, my hand goes\u2026\
  \ crack. \n\nDespite the shocking sound of my hand, we didn't skip a beat as we\
  \ arrived at Khajuraho and started exploring. Why would a simple incident like this\
  \ stop Indiana Jones from pleasing his instafollowers? Don\u2019t call me junior!\
  \ Since there weren't any medical facilities in the entire town, I made a makeshift\
  \ sling attaching my arm to my body with a belt. I hopped into the back seat of\
  \ our tour guide's motorcycle and continued on.\n\nWe wandered around this stunning\
  \ village. The monkeys running up and down the streets, the smell of curry and spices,\
  \ and the Kama Sutra like temples almost made me forget about the incident. It feels\
  \ like Venezuelan custom for everyone to play doctor when an accident of this nature\
  \ happens. I heard many expert opinions from my companions that suggested \"it's\
  \ not a big deal\" and \"it will get better with some ice\u201D.\n\nMy fellow travelers'\
  \ advice and the sling seemed to work until I arrived at Varanasi and the pain and\
  \ swelling were unbearable. Varanasi is a bigger town with a few more resources.\
  \ The hotel concierge, a fast friend, and new medical advisor found a doctor that\
  \ agreed to see me. He put me in the back of a tuk-tuk navigating the traffic, car\
  \ horns, and pollution. Didn't you want the whole Indian experience, Jones?\n\n\
  We arrived in the clinic- a medical office nestled in the basement of the doctor\u2019\
  s home. We filled out forms and waited for the instructions that an x-ray was needed\
  \ immediately. The fancy machines you see in a commercial stayed on the TV, this\
  \ was rural India. \n\nThe visit felt never-ending. After a thorough review of the\
  \ radiography, the doctor whispered something in Hindi to his wife, a fellow physician\
  \ and our official translator. Then the words I was dreading were relayed to me:\
  \ it\u2019s a fracture. The cast was put on immediately thereafter. To make things\
  \ even better, the only plaster left for the cast was printed with a pink camouflage\u2013\
  \ so everybody would know I was a broken man walking. Even Indiana Jones wear pink!\
  \ \n\nWe thanked the doctors for their amazing service and went onwards to a ceremony\
  \ on the Ganges River. The whole process seemed like an adventure I could laugh\
  \ at until I returned to Venezuela and checked in with my doctor. It was worse than\
  \ we thought. My second metacarpal broke into three pieces and I had to get immediate\
  \ surgery before my move to Boston to avoid serious, permanent damage. Following\
  \ his instructions, I had the surgery, left for Boston in a cast (at least it was\
  \ white), and returned to my days of being a lawyer."
