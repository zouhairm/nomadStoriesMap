Text: "In the summer of 2015, I ventured to Ontario, Canada with a few friends and\
  \ a guide to canoe an 85 mile loop in the Quetico Provincial Park. We began with\
  \ a rough outline of our intended course, with plenty of room for happy accidents\
  \ and roving beyond the route. Most days consisted of roughly 8 hours of canoeing\
  \ and portaging, with small breaks every now and again to take in the scenery and\
  \ prepare for the rest of the voyage. These portages were incredibly physically\
  \ demanding, as they required transferring all of our equipment, including our massive\
  \ aluminum canoes, longer than 10 feet and weighing 95 pounds each. These had to\
  \ be lurched onto one person\u2019s shoulders, then carried inverted through unmarked\
  \ paths in the underbrush barely the width of the canoe. After five or six portages\
  \ and several hours of rowing, we were thoroughly exhausted every night. Each day\
  \ as the sun set, we would pull our canoes onto a suitable island in this land of\
  \ lakes, set camp, and recount the adventures of our day before sinking into sleep\
  \ around the campfire. On one such afternoon, we decided to unload early, and moored\
  \ our canoes on an island with a striking rocky peak towering over a sweeping field\
  \ of wild berries and labrador tea bushes. Upon discovering this fruitful plain,\
  \ we threw down our gear with reckless urgency and dashed through the field, ecstatically\
  \ tossing wild Canadian blueberries into the makeshift buckets of our upturned caps.\
  \ The wild fruit was a welcome addition to our diet of granola and peanut butter.\
  \ With full hats in our now blue-dyed hands, we raced the dying sunlight to the\
  \ highest point on the island, soaring hundreds of feet above the lakes below. Parked\
  \ atop this miniature mountaintop, we slowly depleted our afternoon harvest while\
  \ witnessing one of the greatest sunsets I believe I will ever remember. We could\
  \ hear the wolves howling increase in frequency as the sun sunk lower and the moon\
  \ dragged slowly up the sky. It was there in that moment that I found something\
  \ I did not expect. Sitting amongst friends on a wild peak, deeper in true nature\
  \ than I had ever ventured before, I found freedom. I recognized then something\
  \ that will forever linger in my mind; the realization that at the heart of everything,\
  \ the one element in my life I cared about most was nature. I had always known that\
  \ I loved the outdoors, I had always read John Muir and camped with the Boy Scouts,\
  \ but that realization was deeper. To me it was reassuring to recognize that as\
  \ long as I live, I will always have a home in the outdoors, I will always have\
  \ a passion, something to look forward to, or to care for. I will always have nature.\
  \ This recognition has compelled me to where I am today, studying to earn a degree\
  \ to someday make a living protecting that which I care for most, that which inspires\
  \ me. On the final day of our excursion, my group decided to wake a few hours before\
  \ dawn to canoe the final leg of our journey under the powerful light of the Milky\
  \ Way on a moonless night. With nothing guiding us but our shared celestial ceiling,\
  \ we paddled in silence, afraid to disturb what could not have been a more perfect\
  \ image. The sun slowly peered over the mountains, pouring its orange glow onto\
  \ the reflective black of the still morning waters. Bats whistled past us and bald\
  \ eagles imposed their impressive silhouettes among the branches above the shores.\
  \ The whole journey was ethereal, I am incredibly grateful to have experienced something\
  \ that imprinted me with such a deep appreciation for the wilderness, and I am glad\
  \ to have found something I was not expecting."
