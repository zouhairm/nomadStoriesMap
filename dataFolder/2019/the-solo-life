Text: "Over $1200. That was the final cost of getting a passport. While attempting\
  \ to obtain my birth certificate after my first application, I discovered it did\
  \ not have my first or middle name, in addition to the incorrect date of birth.\
  \ So when you add the cost of the two passport applications, copies of my birth\
  \ certificate(s), filing a petition with the court to get it corrected, mailing\
  \ documents, flying out to Phoenix to attend court in-person, obtaining new copies\
  \ of the updated birth certificate (deep sigh), it cost me over $1200. \n      \
  \  I was 34 and single with a slew of married or coupled friends. Some of whom had\
  \ children and some of whom just didn\u2019t have the travel itch. I was tired of\
  \ waiting; waiting on my passport; waiting on my better half to come along and sweep\
  \ me off my feet and travel the world with me. Once I finally had that booklet in\
  \ my possession, I wasn\u2019t about to wait on one of the coupled friends to figure\
  \ out how they could make time to come with me. I decided I was going alone.\nI\
  \ was used to doing things alone. I had lived alone for 10 years. I put Target furniture\
  \ together alone. I had set a goal for myself a few years prior to not let being\
  \ alone inhibit me from doing all the things I wanted to do. I started with going\
  \ to see a movie alone and then went out to dinner alone. I could go to Europe alone.\
  \ \n         I decided to start with London but it felt like a waste to fly thousands\
  \ of miles to only visit one city. Paris was a trip I could easily tack on, even\
  \ though I had always found it a bit clich\xE9. Growing up girls were obsessed with\
  \ Paris. The media was always depicting it as this celestial dream. But I had a\
  \ tendency to go against things girls were supposed to like, such as the color pink\
  \ and princesses. But I would be a mere two hour train ride from Paris, so I figured,\
  \ I might as well.\n\tWhile in London, I walked around the city through Trafalgar\
  \ Square, Piccadilly Circle and outside Westminster Abbey. I took a tour bus to\
  \ Stonehenge and Bath, saw a play at the Globe Theater, toured the Tower of London,\
  \ explored Borough Market and stopped at pubs along the way. There were definitely\
  \ parts of London that I loved, particularly the history, but it reminded me so\
  \ much of New York City. I didn\u2019t feel like I had left the United States. \n\
  \tWhen I arrived in Paris, something changed. It suddenly felt like I stepped into\
  \ a fairy tale, or at least, a potential fairy tale. A place where princesses existed\
  \ and a prince might come and charm his way into my heart. I arrived at my 10-room\
  \ boutique hotel and was handed an actual metal key on a key chain with burgundy\
  \ fringe. The furniture was vibrant and unique with a velvety pink chair, red patterned\
  \ walls on one side and white brick on the other. The French doors that led out\
  \ to a Juliet balcony were my favorite part. I stood looking out across the rooftops,\
  \ with the wind blowing my hair and the sun warming my shoulders, optimism blossoming\
  \ inside me. \nI stayed in the storybook neighborhood of St. Germain; A row of caf\xE9\
  s along a river of cobblestone; lively people drinking libations, wrapped in jazz.\
  \ I felt more beautiful than I\u2019d ever felt before. Something in the warm, evening\
  \ air rejuvenated my skin and painted a glow on my cheeks. Despite my lack of French,\
  \ I felt confident as I walked the streets or sat alone at a caf\xE9 with a glass\
  \ of red wine.\nThere was a paradigm shift. I had always considered myself independent\
  \ but there were plans I put on hold because I was waiting for someone to accompany\
  \ me. I\u2019m still plotting my next move but this trip brought me one step closer\
  \ to accepting that I need to move forward whether I have my prince (better-half,\
  \ travel partner) or not. Not to mention, other magical cities are awaiting me."
