Text: "Since we were on the road and felt the change of pavement, from cement to rocks,\
  \ we knew a great experience awaited. The sky began to darken and to feel chilly\
  \ from inside the car. The car stopped. I noticed vintage hanging lanterns, old\
  \ wooden doors with iron knobs, and a tunnel that crossed a mountain in front of\
  \ us. On top of the tunnel, it was carved in stone \u201COgarrio\u201D, with two\
  \ lighted lanterns beside.\n     We entered the tunnel, and inside, the temperature\
  \ began to lower and to feel moist. Since there, I had an exciting feeling inside\
  \ me. After approximately 10 minutes, we saw a light at the end of the tunnel, the\
  \ daylight that remained. As we entered the uphill small town surrounded by mountains,\
  \ it felt that time stopped and that we were on another universe. \n     One drop,\
  \ two drops, three drops in the window: suddenly it was raining. As the car moved,\
  \ we could see people in their _jorongos_ covering from the cold, eating _elotes_\
  \ and holding hot cups of coffee with both hands, that I believe, felt warmer than\
  \ a hug in a cold night. The church bells started ringing, and instantly, I saw\
  \ the church tower through the window, the tallest building in town. We got to park\
  \ the car and entered to the Airbnb called, \u201CLa Luna y las Estrellas\u201D\
  , \u201CThe Moon and the Stars\u201D. Two beautiful balconies had a view to the\
  \ town\u2019s center, it had already stopped raining and the moon was shining bright,\
  \ as well as the old town lanterns.\n      A new day awaited to discover Real de\
  \ Catorce, Mexico. Real de Catorce, in English means \u201CReal of Fourteen\u201D\
  \ or \u201CRoyal of Fourteen\u201D. Locals said they were many versions of why the\
  \ town is called this way. One of them is that there were fourteen bandits that\
  \ robbed people and committed crime while riding their horses, as in a Wild West\
  \ tale. \n     We decided to go on a downhill tour in small vans called Willy\u2019\
  s, a Ford\u2019s model. I decided to go on top of the van. When the Willy went downhill,\
  \ it was pure adrenaline and there were amazing views. That route had 2 stops. The\
  \ first stop was in a mine that dated from colonial Mexico. Real de Catorce is a\
  \ miner town, and in colonial Mexico, it was a major exporter of silver and gold.\
  \ On the second stop, we got to see the peyotes, which are small spineless cactuses\
  \ with psychoactive properties. \n     Peyotes cannot be consumed or cut by people\
  \ who not belong to the _Huicholes_, they are protected by law. Huicholes are an\
  \ indigenous group that use this plant for their religious ceremonies, considered\
  \ by them as a mystical plant. This group dates from pre-colonial Mexico; the Wirikuta\
  \ desert, which is near Real de Catorce, is one of the most sacred territories to\
  \ them; peyote grows in this land. \n     Real de Catorce is the best of both worlds,\
  \ you can see pre-colonial and colonial Mexico there. When I walked through the\
  \ cobblestone streets, I could see people riding horses through town. As the moon\
  \ was rising and the wind began to feel chilly, I decided to stop by the oldest\
  \ hotel in town, \u201CEl Mes\xF3n de la Abundancia\u201D, \u201CThe Meson of Abundance\u201D\
  . A knight armor was in the establishment\u2019s entrance, and the place felt very\
  \ cozy. I order a delicious homemade, out of the oven, chocolate and pear pie and\
  \ a cup of coffee. \n     As I went out of the hotel to get to the apartment, I\
  \ walked through the old cobblestone streets and watched the dark silhouette of\
  \ the mountains that surrounded that mystical town. I watched two lighted crosses,\
  \ one on top of the east mountain, and the other one on top of the west mountain.\
  \ Locals told me they were placed there to scare away demons.\n     I opened the\
  \ old bars iron door, then the wooden door, watched the moon, breath the old towns\
  \ air, had a final glance to the lighted crosses and enjoyed the view of my last\
  \ night in the magical town: Real de Catorce, Mexico.\n\n*elote: Mexican snack\n\
