Text: "It was the day following my last exam. I boarded my one way flight out into\
  \ the unknown, alone for the first time. I had no concrete plans, hotel rooms, or\
  \ tour guides, but I did have my enthusiasm. My aim was simple, go on an adventure!\
  \ \nTwo months on I'm being searched by police at the Croatian-Bosnian border. Not\
  \ that I blame them. I was living in a van along with 4 other travelers and a cat,\
  \ Pheobe. When the police checked our passports they noticed that we had different\
  \ nationalities:British, Italian, Israeli, American, and Maltese.  Lamb, the American,\
  \ was 'homefree', showered in rivers, and washed his hair with olive oil. His current\
  \ project was 'Dickless Pics', evolving from his annoyance at 'dick pics'. He would\
  \ take nude pictures wherever he went, covering his intimate parts with some imaginative\
  \ object found in his surroundings. \nLamb guided us through a yoga session around\
  \ the van as it was being searched. Luckily all the police found was a suspicious\
  \ bag of salt and a single handcuff. It was a sweltering day. We crammed into the\
  \ van and drove in search of  Kravica Waterfall, a 30-minute drive from the border.\
  \ We dreamt of the icy blue waters. We were close to our destination, however Lamb\
  \ did not believe in paying to enter natural parks. We were sneaking in. \nLamb\
  \ promised an easy way in. We naively believed him and set off. It started off as\
  \ promised, walking through a path between little trees, but they gradually became\
  \ denser and the path disappeared. We jumped over logs, fought our way through dense\
  \ shrubs and itched at stinging nettles. We lost two of our group as we couldn\u2019\
  t see further than a meter ahead of us. I could hear the fresh sound of flowing\
  \ water. I rushed on in anticipation, my sweat drenched body craving the cool river.\
  \ As I stepped out of the forest, I found myself standing at the top of a sloping\
  \ cliff. I was sure the waterfall lay at the bottom, so I began my descent, my companions\
  \ following. \nWe were not at the waterfall, yet the dark river beckoned us in.\
  \ We stripped our clothes off and sprang into the fresh river. The relief soon faded\
  \ as we became aware that we were in the middle of nowhere. Lamb swam down the river.\
  \ We stayed behind enjoying the cascade of small waterfalls, moss covered rocks,\
  \ shining bright green under the summer sun. I was a child as I jumped off the rocks\
  \ into the pools formed by falling water. \nLamb returned having found the waterfall.\
  \ We would just need to swim down the river, easy. Except that we had to carry our\
  \ bags. Lamb assured me he could swim with them, but it was much harder than he\
  \ believed and he went under the water several times. We trudged our way through\
  \ reeds and over boulders. Suddenly I found myself being stared at by tourists.\
  \ We crawled out of the water, collapsing onto the earth. Lamb wheezed, his cheerful,\
  \ devil-may-care attitude nowhere to be seen. He spluttered that he had never felt\
  \ so close to death. The previous day I asked why he wanted to become a writer.\
  \ He recounted how books provided a refuge to him, thus he desired to give that\
  \ to others. His current life was not easy, he was distracted from his purpose,\
  \ but this episode brought back his urgency to write. . \nWe made it to the towering\
  \ waterfalls and reunited with our lost friends. Lamb discovered a gigantic piece\
  \ of petrified wood. It would be the perfect accessory for a 'dickless pic'! We\
  \ set off along the brilliantly turquoise rivers to find the spot. Roots snaked\
  \ their way beneath the glassy waters. One trunk came up like a podium. Lamb stripped\
  \ down and climbed over trees to reach it. He held the petrified wood in one hand\
  \ to protect his decency and a large staff in the other, adopting a warrior pose.\
  \ We snapped a picture, and there it was, the best 'dickless pic' yet! Lamb looked\
  \ grand, not to mention hilarious, standing atop the crystalline lake among the\
  \ leafy green trees."
