Text: "Under the star-studded sky, past the larger-than-life billboards along the\
  \ interstate, we\u2019re off to the Belis coffee farms nestled in the Cordillera\
  \ mountain range. Every hour, I weave in and out of sleep with the swing of the\
  \ bus as it travels further, further north.\n\nSoon, the morning light glows from\
  \ behind the mountains, and the stars fade away. It\u2019s pale blue and pink as\
  \ we climb higher and roll into the bus terminal at Baguio. It\u2019s still quite\
  \ early, 5 a.m., but Baguio is already beginning their day. Small and pleasant,\
  \ Baguio with its curvy roads, hilly terrain, and fog feels like an American town\
  \ in the Northwest as fresh mountain air mixes with jeepney smog as we walk past\
  \ a meat shop, coffee shop, a bakery. After idling for an hour, we climb onto the\
  \ jeepney along with other sweatshirt-clad people. We\u2019re off, climbing higher\
  \ and higher, closer and closer to the height arabica coffee is grown at 3000 feet.\
  \ Students and workers with farming supplies join the ride, and we\u2019re sitting\
  \ shoulder-to-shoulder as the road twists and turns up the mountain. \n\nSoon, we\
  \ arrived at Kilometer 21, and no longer than 10 minutes pass when jeepney lumbers\
  \ down the mountain towards the coffee farms. We climb on. We hop off the jeepney\
  \ at Auntie Asthrine\u2019s home, and I look out the overlook at the home where\
  \ coffee grows up. \n\nAs the sun hits the vegetation, all the leaves glimmer, shimmer,\
  \ and show off as the deep green of the alnus trees shades the coffee cherries.\
  \ The blue sky transforms, hour to hour, minute to minute, it\u2019s unpredictable.\
  \ The sun waxes and wanes according to its wishes, and as it moves across the sky,\
  \ the shadows dance upon the mountain ridges, reflecting off the trees and sayote.\
  \ But the fog settles in as lunchtime swings by.\n\nThe winds shift towards Belis,\
  \ and the cold rushes in, the kind that makes you shiver even with a jacket on.\
  \ The mountains fade away as the fog glides in, then there is nothing to be seen\
  \ except for soft white fog and the bleak grey of the clouds signaling that rain\
  \ is coming. Droplets of water pitter-patters onto the metal roof as we, the Ibaloi\
  \ farmers, the dogs, the chickens, and pigs duck under the shelter of the farm.\
  \ But the ducks joyfully splash in the puddles as we watch and languidly sit on\
  \ the porch sipping coffee from the farm. \n\nThe rain and the fog continue their\
  \ journey, and the mountain peaks soon turn into green islands peeking out of the\
  \ sea of white fog. Soon, the sun begins to hide behind the mountains, and blues,\
  \ purples, pinks, oranges splash across the sky. The pink and white cotton candy\
  \ clouds travel past the farm as the insects begin their nightly song. The birds\
  \ settle in for the night in the leaves, and we leave the overlook to walk back\
  \ down the mountain to enjoy dinner with family.\n\nLike in coffee tastings back\
  \ in Manila, as I gaze at the Cordilleras, I struggle to experience it all: the\
  \ immense depth, the sweet smell, the entire palette of color, the cacophony of\
  \ the wildlife, the soft spoken tones of the Ibaloi farmers, and I can\u2019t look\
  \ away because as soon as I do, the experience dies away as does the evanescent\
  \ tasting notes of grapefruit, honey, and dark chocolate of the coffee from Belis\
  \ soon fades away from my tongue too. What doesn\u2019t fade away is the warmness\
  \ everywhere here in Belis that exists regardless of the temperature, present in\
  \ the welcoming smiles and laughs of Auntie Asthrine and the whole community of\
  \ farmers here in Benguet.\n\nIt is here, somewhere between Baguio and paradise,\
  \ where coffee grows up."
