Text: "When traveling you acquire new knowledge, not only cultural, gastronomic, but\
  \ the daily lives of people and their attitudes. At the moment you are about to\
  \ make your journey elsewhere, be it another region of your home country, or in\
  \ another, we must be prepared to know how we communicate, at least the basics.\
  \ Gestures, words that can be offensive, even to be welcomed, who does not like\
  \ to be treated well? At least I like it. And always before you travel to a new\
  \ place, I try to learn basic language words, you never know when you will need\
  \ or what and who you will find, not everyone knows how to speak other languages\
  \ except his. I hear people say that Frenchmen are arrogant people who don't want\
  \ to help, they don't try to communicate unless they're in their language. But of\
  \ course, like much other countries, many people act the same way, they think: come\
  \ to my country and I must speak in another language. But what I can say about the\
  \ French is that I didn't see any moment they were being arrogant, or not helping\
  \ me. Politeness and respect for others must always exist, to think that today you\
  \ need guidance and tomorrow you can be the one to give it. Knowing how to treat\
  \ others is fundamental, being anywhere in the world. If you want to be treated\
  \ well, treat someone who's coming your way the same way you want to be treated.\
  \ My travels to France have always been good, I can speak the basics in French,\
  \ however when they communicated with me, I could understand what they informed,\
  \ and by answering them I said: \"Pardonnez-moi, je comprends ce que vous dites,\
  \ mais je ne sais pas parler fran\xE7ais.\" (Forgive Me, I Understand What You're\
  \ Saying, but I do Not Know How to Speak French.). And so, all of them to this day,\
  \ tried to talk and guide me as they could, often mixing French with English, being\
  \ always very cordial. After their nominations, I would appreciate and them always\
  \ smiling back. I didn't expect to find such a posture, since people spoken it's\
  \ never going to be an attitude French. It was in the hotel, restaurant, shop or\
  \ on the streets. Many Frenchmen sometimes came to ask me for information about\
  \ what was going on, and they no moment ceased to listen to what I had to say about\
  \ such a situation. There was once, when I was trapped between the door and a bicycle\
  \ on the subway, gently one of the passengers, who was French, helped me. There\
  \ was another time when trying to get off the subway with the suitcase, one held\
  \ the ratchet and passed with my suitcase, for the simple gesture of helping. Last\
  \ time I was in France, my flight arrived at 11 p.m., the airport was empty, and\
  \ I didn't know where I'd find the bus that would take me to my hotel. Gently, I\
  \ approached a security guard who was working there and asked him in a weak French,\
  \ he asked me if I spoke French, and I told him that unfortunately not. He explains,\
  \ he'd try with the little English he knew and hoped he'd help me. And in fact,\
  \ his help was excellent, because his guidance led me to my bus. As I aforementioned,\
  \ to respect and be cordial to all, the impressions a person can have of you, can\
  \ and will change the experience you have not only in your life but in your travel."
