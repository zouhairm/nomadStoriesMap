Text: "\u201CJust tell people you\u2019re Canadian.\u201D The final advice from international\
  \ pals rings in my popping ears en route from Koh Samui to Ho Chi Minh City. \n\n\
  Honest as Abe, I cannot tell a lie.\n\nThe metropolis formerly known as Saigon is\
  \ the premiere destination for my Vietnam Tour. The name change occurring at the\
  \ close of the Vietnam War signifies the country\u2019s reunification. Although\
  \ the Fall of Saigon marked the war\u2019s official end, its heinous side effects\
  \ continue to permeate the land like the potent chemical compound, Agent Orange.\
  \ The defoliant birthed by my motherland has destroyed so much, including my all\
  \ American pride.\n\nLike it or not, being American is largely a part of who I am.\
  \ Being American is the blessing providing me the ease to cross borders, acquire\
  \ visas, and live a [relatively] financially free existence. Being American is also\
  \ the curse prompting my guilt and discomfort as I meander through the Ben Thanh\
  \ Street Food Market alongside my Vietnamese counterpart, Sunny. \n\nSunny, the\
  \ daughter of a pork farmer from the country\u2019s capital, Hanoi, is my envoy\
  \ for all things Vietnamese. Pausing outside a food stand boasting \u201CPho\u201D\
  \ in large red letters, she beams in my direction. \u201CYou must try pho.\u201D\
  \ \n\nThe popular Vietnamese soup consisting of broth, noodles, and meat is famous\
  \ local fare. A vegetarian, I cannot. I also cannot help but notice the similarity\
  \ of sound between the soup\u2019s pronunciation and the word \u201Cfoe.\u201D Am\
  \ I an enemy here? \n\nI confess my vegetarianism to the heiress of a pork farm.\n\
  \n\u201CNo worries. You try b\xE1nh m\xEC instead.\u201D Sunny accepts me for who\
  \ I am. Moving forward, she leads the search for the country\u2019s signature sandwich.\n\
  \nWeaving our way through the market, I delight in the sensory circus\u2013 exotic\
  \ fruits hang from baskets and a melody of aromas wafts through the air. Nearby,\
  \ an elderly woman chops the head off a fresh fish. Its helpless body flops about,\
  \ silver scales shimmering in the sunlight. \n\n\u201COh no! I so sorry!\u201D Sunny\
  \ makes a motion to cover my eyes. In spite of our inherit histories, she takes\
  \ care to protect me. \n\nAt last we find ourselves outside a b\xE1nh m\xEC stall\
  \ where a petite woman in her early-twenties dishes out delectable combinations\
  \ of baguettes stuffed with shredded vegetables and assorted cheeses and meats.\
  \ \n\n\u201CB\xE1nh m\xEC #19, please.\u201D My accent confesses my nationality\
  \ while my mispronunciation pronounces my fear. Mistakenly referring to the sandwich\
  \ as a \u201Cban me,\u201D my internal struggle is revealed\u2013 what right does\
  \ an American have to be here?\n\nThe next day, a local guide and twelve guests\
  \ accompany Sunny and me to The War Remnants Museum. As per the man in the ticket\
  \ booth\u2019s instructions, we commence our tour on the top floor and work our\
  \ way down through the chilling time capsule. Objective evidence evoking shock,\
  \ pity, shame, fear, disgust, and embarrassment tells an incontestable story. An\
  \ exhibit showcasing Agent Orange\u2019s lasting consequences captures the defoilant\u2019\
  s life destroying essence so accurately, my searing soul forces me to leave the\
  \ room. I soldier through the remainder of the museum alone, waging war with my\
  \ homeland. \n\nA tribute to true American War Heroes illuminates the exit. Photographs\
  \ of military men who refused unjust orders, anti-war propaganda made by and for\
  \ U.S Soldiers, and a protest of articles written by a top-ranked pilot paint a\
  \ paradoxical picture of patriotism. Here I resign my resentment towards The Land\
  \ of the Free and make peace with The Home of the Brave. \n\nLater that afternoon,\
  \ Sunny takes me to a vegan cafe where we order meatless bowls of pho. Savoring\
  \ our lunch in old Saigon, we reflect on our pasts. Bonding over favorite films,\
  \ we relish the here and now. For dessert, we split che\u0300 ba\u0300 ba, a combination\
  \ of taro, sweet potato, and cassava cooked in coconut milk. Sharing our aspirations\
  \ over the dish, we get a taste at a sweet future."
