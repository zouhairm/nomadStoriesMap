Text: "Following the curves of shadows along the rock face we arrived at our destination.\
  \ The red earth around the small pool of water, although undisturbed, had a sense\
  \ of inviting, calling us to come and take a seat. In its purest form, we were being\
  \ welcomed to country. To the land of the Anangu people, and the home of Uluru.\
  \ \n\nA bump in the red road drew my attention to a crooked sign bursting out of\
  \ the red earth. The community of Mutijulu had 'Restricted Entry' but we had been\
  \ granted permission under unique circumstances. As we made our way into the dry,\
  \ dusty main street it became apparent how unique those circumstances were as every\
  \ eye tracked our Jeep as it rolled by the small, corrugated houses. There were\
  \ old cars rusting in the unforgiving sun, and every surface was lightly brushed\
  \ with the rich red sand.\n\nThe months of excitement and anticipation leading up\
  \ to this trip quickly dissipated into dread as we felt the enormous weight of the\
  \ ongoing conflict between Indigenous and modern Australians consume us. Standing\
  \ there in our ironed white shirts and shiny new boots, the 'gap' had never been\
  \ so huge. \n\nThere were a few awkward exchanges as we entered the Childhood Centre.\
  \ Not sure where to stand or put our hands, we felt every move being watched by\
  \ the group of mothers gathering at the other end of the room. It was the children\
  \ that eventually broke the silence. Despite the colour of our skin or the language\
  \ that we spoke, we quickly discovered that a smile is universal. As we were dragged\
  \ into the playground, our white shirts were quickly splashed with red dust, and\
  \ the barriers started to crumble. \n\nAnd so the learning began. We were not there\
  \ to fix or change their ways, but to learn just as much as we taught. Indigenous\
  \ children are reared quite differently to you or me. And there is a lot to learn\
  \ from it. They don't recognise nuclear families the same way we do, and believe\
  \ they are taught by the earth and the spirits that inhabit it. If a child was not\
  \ looking where they were running, we were not to warn them, nor fuss over them\
  \ when they ultimately fell. Instead, the earth that scraped their knee would teach\
  \ them, and the experience would be one they'd learn from.\n\nA few days into our\
  \ stay, the supervisor at the Childcare Centre changed. While Michelle had grown\
  \ up in community, Nicole was raised in urban Queensland; the daughter of a teacher\
  \ and pharmacist. Instantly I noticed a different style with the kids. The days\
  \ became more structured, the rules more regulated, and our interaction more detached.\
  \ To me, this simple experience spoke volumes to the greater struggle of the Indigenous\
  \ peoples of Australia. That is not to say that one approach is better or worse\
  \ than the other, but simply recognising that they are not the same, and also need\
  \ not be. \n\nBut aside from this past, from this history that weighs more heavily\
  \ on my core the more I learn of it, I saw a silver lining. Each day when we drove\
  \ into the closed community, we were greeted with shining smiles. And aside from\
  \ this past that had broken families, lost stories, and deprived many of their culture,\
  \ they still smiled. They were willing to share their secrets to finding native\
  \ 'lollies' on the trees, and creating paint from the earth, and they begged us\
  \ to teach them how to play games and sing songs from our childhood.\n\nIt was on\
  \ the last day, however, when one of the kids, balancing on a low-hanging branch,\
  \ slipped and fell. Resisting my habitual urge to race to his side, it took me a\
  \ second to register his mother actually gesturing to me across the yard to go and\
  \ comfort him. \n\nIn spite of all that existed between our cultures, through the\
  \ smallest act she managed to make me feel a part of something so utterly genuine\
  \ and unlike anything I've ever experienced again. She lifted a weight from my shoulders\
  \ and changed something in my very core."
