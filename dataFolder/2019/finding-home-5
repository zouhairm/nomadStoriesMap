Text: "Every time I\xB4ve traveled, there\xB4ve been moments which make a difference\
  \ in who I was before and after those happened, but certainly, there have been experiences\
  \ which marked me the most and which I keep jealously in my heart and my memory.\
  \  When I was younger, I used to read a lot, so I read a story about old Spain,\
  \ and a shepherd who crossed the Strait of Gibraltar in search of a dream, since\
  \ that moment, I deeply desired to go pursue my own dreams... never have I thought\
  \ that, so many years after I read that book, I would find myself doing that same\
  \ route without intending. \n\nIt all started as a study trip, but ended being deeper\
  \ than that, suddenly I found myself crossing the great yet short border between\
  \ Spain and Morocco. When I arrived and got of the ferry, then it hit me, a punch\
  \ of reality in which I was in an unknown country where they didn\xB4t speak any\
  \ language that I knew; there were so many people, so many strange letters, and\
  \ the salty smell of the sea. I started walking trying to find something to eat\
  \ before the rest of the adventure continued, I tried my best to communicate, but\
  \ I felt so lost, and suddenly a boy came across and looked me in the eyes, his\
  \ eyes were beautiful, deep blue, he talked to me in that strange language I didn\xB4\
  t understood what he was telling me, but then I got it, that the story of his people\
  \ is connected with the story of Spanish people, and in that way, they are connected\
  \ to the story of my people. Strangely, I felt a little more at home.\n\nAs time\
  \ went by I arrived at a local market, and what I saw really overwhelmed me, in\
  \ a good way. There were a great number of sellers in the street, selling food,\
  \ weaves, oil, species, and so many colorful thigs, that I had never saw or smelled\
  \ before. The streets got full of colors and strange noises of the joint voices\
  \ of the people buying and selling stuff, a man with an instrument started playing\
  \ a song I didn\xB4t knew, but which rhythm was the same as the one inside my heart,\
  \ tourists taking pictures with snakes and other animals, women making henna tattoos,\
  \ and in the middle of that chaos, I felt peace, I felt near home in a way that\
  \ I can\xB4t explain. I continued walking, with every turn I found more and more\
  \ colors and lights. I completely fell in love with the artisan\u2019s hands that\
  \ were seen in each market stall, because they made such beautiful things, and so\
  \ richly decorated as I\xB4ve never seen before. Then suddenly all the stories I\xB4\
  ve read got sense, people were amazing, and it all seemed like a thousand dreams.\
  \ Suddenly mi thoughts were interrupted by a chant, from the tower of a mosque came\
  \ a voice calling the people to pray, and the Muslim people went to devote their\
  \ faith, as my people back home responded to the sound of bells.\n\nThe next day\
  \ I took a tour inside the dessert, as I interned in the dunes, I started to feel\
  \ the fear of being insignificant and alone in the middle of an unknown land, but\
  \ when I stopped walking, it was immediately replaced with such a great peace, I\
  \ took a look at the last sunrays as the night came in, painting the sky with a\
  \ palette of colors from the light yellow to the dark blue. I lied back in the sand\
  \ and felt all the tiny soft grains between my fingers, and the wind stroking my\
  \ face. I opened my eyes and saw the first shooting star crossing the dark sky,\
  \ I don\xB4t remember ever looking at so many stars, I made a wish. Then I let myself\
  \ go, I was so tired yet grateful of arriving to that place, which since then, I\
  \ carry inside my heart as a treasure, because that night I discovered the entire\
  \ world can feel like home."
