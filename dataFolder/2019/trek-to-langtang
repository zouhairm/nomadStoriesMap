Text: 'Well my country is known for highest peak in the world which is Mt Everest.Since
  working in a tourism industry for more then five years i was truly inspired by the
  trekkers who comes from different part of the world to conquer the highest peak
  in the world.So my dream is also to be at the top of Mt Everest one day.For that
  i need to have experienced climbing small mountain so i chose Langtang to have trekking
  experience and it was great and unforgettable memory of my life.

  it was a week trekking and we had to climb almost 6000 meter high from sea level.since
  it was my first time i had difficulties in walking and i was suffocating because
  of high altitude.we have to carry tent,stoves and food stuffs.we have to trekking
  equipment with us which includes special shoes,jacket,cap,gloves that keeps us safe
  from cold.once we were at the top of the mountain the view was superb.it made me
  felt that i came in heaven.

  Now i have only dream in my life to be at the top of Mt everest and want to experience
  that exciting feel which i will get once i am at the top of the world.'
