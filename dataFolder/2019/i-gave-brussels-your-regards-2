Text: "\u201CGive Brussels my regards\u201D, the last words my grandad ever said to\
  \ me before he passed away. His description of the city made it seem like he had\
  \ lived there his entire life, when in reality it had been over 50 years since he\
  \ last stepped foot in the European capital. \u201CThere\u2019s a caf\xE9 next to\
  \ a cobbled street which has a bright red sign, you have to go there!\u201D  \n\n\
  There I was, about to follow in his footsteps with the hope that one day I could\
  \ tell my grandchild the same stories that he had told me, invigorating them to\
  \ seek discomfort so they wouldn\u2019t be afraid to take a leap into the unknown.\n\
  \nHowever, a wave of guilt lingered over me as I embarked upon a trip so close to\
  \ the passing of such an important figure in my life. I arrived in Brussels hoping\
  \ to make an impression on the place that I hoped to one day call home. Yet, here\
  \ I found myself searching for a caf\xE9 with a red sign, just to feel like I had\
  \ done something with him one last time. \n\nBy chance, I arrived at the Grand Square\
  \ or as the locals call it, Grote Markt, late at night when all the tourists had\
  \ wandered off to the local estaminets. The square is a symbol of the city\u2019\
  s former 17th-century wealth. An impressive collection of golden figures are looming\
  \ around the edges of the rooftops. Each sculpture, illuminated by lights, gazed\
  \ upon me from above like a celestial being there to remind me of how small and\
  \ lost we are in such an undiscovered world. \n\nI sat alone on a cold marble step,\
  \ which during the day is filled with tourists laughing and smiling as they pose\
  \ for pictures which will at some point bring back a rush of nostalgia. By night,\
  \ it becomes a place of rumination.\n\nA sudden chime of bells rang out harmoniously\
  \ from the steeple which overlooks all who visited the square. The same song could\
  \ be heard in the distance from bells at neighbouring churches a second behind,\
  \ creating an echoing vibration which howled through my bones, clearing my mind\
  \ of all thoughts. I sat in silence, as the heavenly ringing acted as holy water,\
  \ cleansing my soul, ridding me of any doubts I previously had. \n\nAs the melody\
  \ ceased the city fell silent for a single moment. subconsciously I found myself\
  \ smiling. A purification of my emotions had occurred, leaving me with nothing but\
  \ sanguinity. \n\nWith this newfound purpose, my observations of the city changed.\
  \ No longer was it about reflection, it was about taking chances. Whether it be\
  \ the 12% red cherry beer from Delirium Caf\xE9 or the grotesquely named Flemish\
  \ Stew from Restobieres, Brussels was about daring to change. \n\nI never did find\
  \ that old caf\xE9 my grandad mentioned however, I did find one with a bright green\
  \ sign which took me back to the last conversation we ever had. So, as I sat alone\
  \ outside under the sign, I raised my glass to the sky and proudly said: \u201C\
  I gave Brussels your regards\u201D."
