Text: "Stagnancy is death. The water that runs through rivers parallels the blood\
  \ running through our veins, and it is this prana, or life force, of fluidity and\
  \ movement that enables us to stay alive. The lust for travel holds that same energy,\
  \ it\u2019s a force beyond rational comprehension that propels us forward into the\
  \ unknown; the fluid movement from one place to another that breaths life into our\
  \ soul.\n\nThe chaos sweeping the planet is rooted in stagnancy as well. Stagnant\
  \ thinking, living, patterns of being. They are rooted in an inability to flow with\
  \ life, embrace the fluid and cyclical nature that is being human. Modern chaos\
  \ is a lack of exposure and embraces the unknown.\n\nLike a rock being shaped by\
  \ the flow of the river, we develop our edges based on the influences of the people,\
  \ places, and things we interact with on a daily basis. This begins to shape our\
  \ identity, and we cling to this identity to feel safe in the world\u2026 it\u2019\
  s who we are, and so to continue to be, we must preserve this constructed identity.\n\
  \nMany have become so attached to their identities that any suggestion of change\
  \ quite often becomes a threat to our very existence. And it is under such pretext\
  \ that we have cultivated fear and even hate for the \u201Cother\u201D. The rise\
  \ of modern technology has enabled us to connect with one another on such a worldwide\
  \ scale, and our underlying fears of change has fuelled the modern ideological divide\
  \ that sweeps the globe.\n\nWe let our differences fuel hatred, assuming that simply\
  \ because someone thinks differently than us, that they must somehow be wrong. Their\
  \ ideology vs. our ideology quickly unravels into them vs. us. Travel, for me, has\
  \ been one of the biggest eye-opening experiences to that fact that there is no\
  \ other, and that \u201Cthe line separating good and evil\u201D, as Dostoyevsky\
  \ put it so poetically in his Gulag Archipelago, \u201Cpasses not through states,\
  \ nor between classes, nor between political parties either -- but right through\
  \ every human heart -- and through all human hearts\u201D.\n\nExploration reconnects\
  \ us with the playful wonders of childhood, being able to see things with our eyes\
  \ for the very first time. It opens us up to a world of possibility, and despite\
  \ perhaps being afraid and lost at times, we eventually find our way amidst the\
  \ chaos. When we fail to explore, our mind begins to atrophy, we develop prejudice,\
  \ and cultivate fears. We increasingly fear the \u201Cother,\u201D this mythical\
  \ being that threatens our own inflexible, stagnant life. When we fail to explore,\
  \ we stifle the blossoming of our soul, for wanderlust is truly the soul yearning\
  \ to connect with the infinite different expressions of itself, all over the world.\n\
  \nWhen we travel, we shed our preconceptions of reality and real-eyes that people\
  \ are experiencing life in so many different ways. Like looking through a kaleidoscope,\
  \ we begin to see the human experience as this infinite well of possibilities, none\
  \ of which are better or worse than the other.\n\nMy own awakening happened when\
  \ I left Canada for Australia, in the winter of 2015. Despite being exposed to globalism\
  \ through the internet and media, I was being shaped continuously by my peer group,\
  \ an identity that I had held onto dearly since high school and university. As I\
  \ longed to awaken, the comfort of my habits and surroundings kept me asleep. The\
  \ safety of my routine kept me from breaking free into this person I was trying\
  \ to become.\n\nRationally, I\u2019ll never know what brought me to Australia, but\
  \ when I close my eyes I know intuitively that it was the same life force that causes\
  \ a rosebud to blossom overnight, or how a single stem cell multiples itself to\
  \ create a human being. Wanderlust is the calling for the individual parts to recognize\
  \ that they are a part of the whole, to unravel in divine perfection. Like every\
  \ cell that makes up our body, we are the cells that make up the body of Mother\
  \ Earth.\n\nAs I took flight half-way across the globe to a land unknown, the last\
  \ thing I ever expected to find, was myself."
