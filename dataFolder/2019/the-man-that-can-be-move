  \ Hongkong, Taiwan and Brunei and my Brother furthermore two of my close friends\
  \ that I helped and got to share hotel accommodations in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand\
  \ all of these came from my points that I've earned within only 2 years including\
  \ round trip plane tickets with hotels and have shared people to discover different\
  \ tourist spots and know their cultures and bring knowledge. All these with my exceptional\
  \ hard work and Dedication to Dish that I've been with in just 5 years of employment\
