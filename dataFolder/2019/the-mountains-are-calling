Text: "To wake up under the mountains is a joy that every noble person must experience\
  \ in their lives. We find our home in the mountains, in the wildness; each of us\
  \ must realise at some point that our souls are nourished by the peace and solemnity\
  \ of nature, by the grandeur of the silent monoliths, by the soil under our feet\
  \ and the snow turning our cheeks to winter-roses. We become wild again, for at\
  \ least a little time. \n\nHere in the snow brushed quiet valley of sequoias and\
  \ waterfalls I found wildness; I found love; I found wild love ... with you, the\
  \ soulmate of my life, met only yesterday ... \n\nSunrise peaked the tips of the\
  \ trees, turning them into beacons for the sun. Icy frosts dusted the meadow grasses\
  \ and Yosemite Falls sung the lauds of the morning  while our warmth freckled faces\
  \ turned to check the mountains hadn\u2019t moved in the night. We set out against\
  \ the wind through the Lower Pines and the Upper Pines and the North Pines, heading\
  \ ever northwards over the little wooden bridge. Mittens in mittens, the Tenaya\
  \ Creek flowing steadily next to us and the North Dome watching steadily just visible\
  \ from above the tips of the pines, we walked.\n\nWinter held itself firmer here.\
  \ Where ancient glaciers had carved their ways through the rock the steely granite\
  \ mountain faces were steep and rugged, birthing below them a new life into the\
  \ fresh green lake of the glacier frozen in its tracks with the thawing frost. It\
  \ really was like a Mirror; mountains seemed as low as they were high, the lake\
  \ as deep as it was shallow. An unmoving, stationary picture of serendipity serenity.\
  \ An enclosed chapel to whisper your confessions, with great listening walls made\
  \ of North Dome on one side and the foot of the mighty Half Dome on the other.\n\
  \nSkies had cleared to blue by midday, and the sun was a blaring glow behind the\
  \ Domes. This place was too lost in winter for the splendid sun to melt her snows,\
  \ but the trees here were still in autumn reds and yellows, and they echoed the\
  \ sunshine golden and it seemed that even in the midst of winter that the Sierra\
  \ in your arms would be the the beating heart of the world, the place that the Sun\
  \ would look upon the most kindly.\n\nBy the time the sun was peaking low, I was\
  \ throughly in love with this place.\n\n\u201CThe mountains are calling and I must\
  \ go\u201D, said John Muir \u2013 and now I had heard their calling, I knew I would\
  \ never be able to resist them again. I knew right then, that you had made it so\
  \ that I must return to this place where you had kissed love into my soul and made\
  \ me moan and the mountains had echoed that love all around the valley. I knew I\
  \ would return.\n\nHours later, with love still fresh in my heart and the pulse\
  \ of the valley beating through my veins, we were standing together underneath the\
  \ magnificent Bridalveil Falls. Right there, at that exact moment, was the first\
  \ time I thought and felt through my whole body that someday you would be marrying\
  \ me, and that it was what I wanted most. That gorgeous white sliver of a waterfall,\
  \ graceful and sad, made me wish more than anything that someday I can have my own\
  \ sheer fall over my golden hair, tumbling like water all the way to my feet. A\
  \ pallu, a veil; a time to be dreamed of and wished for \u2026"
