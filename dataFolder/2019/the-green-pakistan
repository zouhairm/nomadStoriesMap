Text: "Pakistan is full of beautiful and historical places. However, the tragedy is\
  \ that people are more interested in going abroad and talking about the beauty they\
  \ see there, rather than highlighting the grandeur of our own country.\n\nI am taking\
  \ this opportunity to share with the readers a few beautiful places I have visited,\
  \ which were simply astounding and have instilled in me the desire to know more\
  \ about my country.\n\nOur four-hour journey started from Islamabad, where we live,\
  \ to the beautiful river near Kalabagh, called the mighty Indus. The water seemed\
  \ tempting so I wanted to go for a swim but my parents rebuffed my idea, telling\
  \ me that the water was too deep and it was not safe even for adults. Therefore,\
  \ we went only for boating.\n\nThough it was summer, the water was quite cold. After\
  \ sailing on the river for more than an hour, we saw a majestic long red bridge,\
  \ near the town of Kalabagh.\n\nOur boat stopped near a building with a beautiful\
  \ garden, where we had a traditional lunch featuring delicacies like saag, karela,\
  \ lassi and pulao, which our local host had arranged for us. The lunch was simply\
  \ irresistible!\n\nWhen we were done with the lunch, we were left impressed with\
  \ the hospitality of the town people as they presented us with traditional souvenir\
  \ made from salt. Salt-stone crafts are a specialty of this town. We were also informed\
  \ that lightening the salt-stone lamp keeps small bugs and insects away.\n\nAfter\
  \ thanking the host, we left to visit the bungalow of the Nawab of Kalabagh. It\
  \ is a historical place with an impressive grandeur, a place where the Nawab of\
  \ Kalabagh lived.\n\nBy then, evening had already fallen. It was a serene and beautiful\
  \ evening; we decided to visit the historical town of Mianwali and stay there in\
  \ a hotel. Mianwali is about 45 minutes\u2019 drive from Kalabagh town.\n\nThe Indus\
  \ River\nThe next day, after having a scrumptious breakfast, we left for a place\
  \ called Soon Valley in Khushab district. I must say, it is a paradise on earth.\
  \ Green fields, mountains and lakes make this place a wonder in itself. We had yet\
  \ another boat ride in Khabeki Lake. Due to good rainfall, the lake was full of\
  \ water. Being Sindhi ourselves, we were surprised to find the boatman a Sindhi\
  \ too. We took a lot of pictures and selfies to capture these memorable views and\
  \ moments.\n\nThe boatman told us about various local things and we enjoyed his\
  \ company and the boat ride very much. Then, we visited a garden built during the\
  \ British era, named Kanhati Garden in the middle of mountains.\n\nThis garden was\
  \ another beauty. A small waterfall was the central attraction of the garden. By\
  \ the time we left the garden, it was evening.\n\nOur last destination of the day\
  \ was another lake called Kalar Kahar. We had evening tea at the terrace of a restaurant\
  \ just in front of the lake. It was a lovely evening. Our journey ended there. I\
  \ will never forget the beautiful experience I had."
