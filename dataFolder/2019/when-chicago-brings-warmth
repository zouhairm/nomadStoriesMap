Text: "There are two extremes to my lifestyle, either I work a lot or I just jump\
  \ the gun and travel. Destinations vary, depending on budget and mood. Usually I\
  \ am running away from home, get some peace and tranquility. Thus it feels worth\
  \ it. On this particular occasion, I got dubbed a new name, \u201CMs. Stone,\u201D\
  \ at first, I liked it because I thought my friends were naming me after the actress\
  \ Emma Stone, that wasn\u2019t true. I was named stone, because I stay away from\
  \ any form of relationship and I stone wall men who are interested in me.  \n\n\
  This wasn\u2019t the first time I got a name like that but it just felt the right\
  \ time to run again. I thought of the place I wanted to visit and Chicago came on\
  \ my mind. 20+ hours later, I stood at the Chicago O\u2019Hara International Airport.\
  \  Jet lagged and hungry, I searched for a food joint. Sitting on a comfortable\
  \ stool, I had my burger and booked my Airbnb. It had to be the away from the city\
  \ and close to the Willmette temple which I wanted to visit. So I ended up getting\
  \ a place in Skokie which is in between the two. \n\nAs I got to my room, I unpacked\
  \ and slept for 12 hours straight. When I woke up, it was day time and I was ready\
  \ to go out. I had a few places that I had in mind. Downtown first and then the\
  \ Willmette temple, plus I was on a budget and no credit cards in hand. Following\
  \ Google maps, I got on a bus and a Chicago L train and reached downtown. I ended\
  \ up coming in the month of July, which made Chicago a little crowd, but even in\
  \ that crowd, the air was cleaner than I home. \n\nI started walking towards my\
  \ first touristy spot. The John Hancock Center\u2019s 1000feet high tower which\
  \ gave a 360 view of the city and gave me the experience of almost falling from\
  \ a glass holder cell that tilts you to the ground. It's literally called \u201C\
  Tilt.\u201D Even though I have a fear of heights, this was something I wanted to\
  \ experience and as soon as I did it, I felt like I achieved a new goal in life.\
  \ \n\nI was picking a ticket from a gift shop that I spotted a man from the corner\
  \ of my eye and like an idiot I turned towards him. Piercing blue eyes were looking\
  \ straight at me. His ash blonde hair and muscular physique was pretty impressive\
  \ but alas I was here to travel alone. I turned around and exited the building.\n\
  \nI continued to walk and take pictures of the city. The architecture was fascinating,\
  \ its multicultural heritage is prominent in the buildings from Chicago Bungalows\
  \ and Two-Flats to the grand Graystones along Logan Boulevard and Lawndale Avenue,\
  \ from the skyscrapers of the Loop as well as a wealth of sacred architecture like\
  \ the Polish Cathedral.\n\nAs I continued to walk on the bridge, I heard a man calling\
  \ out tourists to go for a boat ride, they were leaving in 5 minutes. I took the\
  \ chance and got on the boat. As I sat there, I closed my eyes, and listened to\
  \ the rush of the waters, the gush of the winds and the chirping of the birds. I\
  \ was at peace. As I opened my eyes, I was surprised to see the same piercing blue\
  \ eyes staring at me. He just got on the boat with some people and seated himself\
  \ next to me.\n\nJustin was his name and he was a local. We sat next to each other\
  \ for almost an hour, drinking our beers, talking about lives. It was a connection\
  \ that I never had before. This boat ride changed my life. Justin initially became\
  \ a tour guide, showing me places that were hidden from the world and I showed him\
  \ the Wilmette temple that he had never heard of before. 3 years down, Justin is\
  \ still a part of my life, and Chicago became the place that turn Ms. Stone into\
  \ Ms. Love."
