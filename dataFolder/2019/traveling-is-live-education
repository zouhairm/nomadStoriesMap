Text: "I like to travel and discover countries all around the world. Discovering the\
  \ hidden tips as a local not as as tourist, eat, danse and speaking as a local.\
  \ Aside the touristic monuments and places I love being lost in the narrow streets\
  \ that it leads to another continent inside the country. I believe, that each country\
  \ has a similarity as my country but in different way, based on all these varieties\
  \ of civilisations I can feel the connection.\nIndulging myself into their daily\
  \ routines, makes me feel I have a family attach abroad wherever I go.\nCome along\
  \ from mountain to beach, countryside to the city it\u2019s like traveling between\
  \ past and future and I enjoy the present. \nJumping from bus to another or walking\
  \ for hours doesn\u2019t stop me to savour the richness of the country.\nI like\
  \ sharing my tips and create an itinerary for friends to avoid the commercial plan\
  \ that the travel agency are offering nowadays.\nMost of my travels are done with\
  \ my husband and ya 3 daughters and they enjoy being in a new country that they\
  \ pointed on a map and we are just there, it\u2019s the best education that I can\
  \ offer them at their early age, and they do remember each moment.\nMy device for\
  \ life, stop spending money for futility and just Travel, it\u2019s an a magical\
  \ feeling and forever lasting memories.\nEmira"
