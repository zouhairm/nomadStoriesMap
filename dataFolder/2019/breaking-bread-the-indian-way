Text: "As I gazed out of the car, I was shocked to see the progress - a modern and\
  \ efficient airport, high rise buildings and an urban rail network. I was ten years\
  \ old, when I last visited my grandfather\u2019s ancestral home in rural Punjab,\
  \ India. He left his motherland as a young Sikh, recruited by the British Raj to\
  \ fight the Japanese in Singapore, during WWII. His post-war migration meant that\
  \ I was a product of the city-state Singapore. I remember being sick throughout\
  \ our 10-day holiday in India, as my tummy never took to Indian spices. From my\
  \ mixed heritage, I relished my Chinese grandmother\u2019s chicken rice more than\
  \ the fiery tandoori chicken. But here I was twenty years later, ready for another\
  \ adventure. All it had taken was the birth of my first child, fluctuating hormones\
  \ and sleep deprivation to pack my bags for India. \u201CMaybe a yoga retreat would\
  \ ground me\u201D I thought. Leaving my mum and husband in service of the baby,\
  \ I boarded my flight.\n\nI arrived at my extended family\u2019s apartment in Delhi\
  \ and where the entire family had gathered to greet me. I also learnt it was a public\
  \ holiday celebrating the birth of Guru Nanak \u2013 the first Guru of the Sikh\
  \ religion. I recalled stories from my grandfather, about the bravery of the Sikh\
  \ Gurus. The house was being decorated with oil-lit lamps and flowers similar to\
  \ the tradition of festival of lights, Deepavali. I was invited to join them for\
  \ prayers at the Gurudwara (Sikh temple). But I was still reeling for mom guilt\
  \ and looked forward to sleeping like a baby (which is an oxymoron). When I woke\
  \ up it was 6 pm and only Aman, the housekeeper was around. Luckily, she spoke basic\
  \ English and I made up the rest with my broken Hindi. She offered to take me to\
  \ a Gurudwara nearby. On the roads, I could see chaos \u2013 traffic crisscrossing\
  \ in all directions, persistent honking, pollution and little kids running bare\
  \ feet along the traffic trying to sell knick-knacks. We took the metro, which was\
  \ clean albeit crowded and similar to any modern day train network. I was curious\
  \ to find where Aman had learnt English. She told me that after her day job she\
  \ goes to a night school to learn English and computer skills. Her early and difficult\
  \ marriage had interrupted her education, but now as a single mum she dreamt of\
  \ a better future for her kids. Despite her struggles, she had a genuine smile and\
  \ a happy disposition. \n\nAs we approached the Gurudwara, I could feel the festivity\
  \ in the air \u2013 the entire street was decorated with strings of suspended lights,\
  \ there was the sound of the Kirtan (Sikh religious music), rows of flowers and\
  \ hundreds of lamps placed around the Gurudwara by devotees. There were volunteers\
  \ collecting visitors\u2019 shoes, cooking and serving Langar (free food from the\
  \ temple kitchen) and cleaning up. As we entered the Gurudwara, we covered our heads\
  \ with scarves and proceeded to pay respects to the Holy book, The Guru Granth Sahib,\
  \ which was adorned by a red velvet cloth with gold embroidery.  The fragrance of\
  \ flowers in the air combined with the hymns of the Kirtan filled my mind with peace.\
  \ Evidently, music is a universal language which speaks to you even when one doesn\u2019\
  t understand the lyrics.  We were served Karah Parasaad, a warm sweet-tasting food\
  \ made of semolina or wheat flour, sugar and ghee (clarified butter). Later, in\
  \ the community kitchen we all sat on the floor to break bread with the congregation,\
  \ which serves as a reminder that the same light illuminates our hearts despite\
  \ our varied socio-economic backgrounds and ethnicities. As I sat there eating simple\
  \ Indian food, I contemplated on the past few months, which were a roller-coaster\
  \ of emotions. Then I noticed Aman\u2019s smile, and realized that although \"suffering\
  \ is universal\" it is our attitude towards it that makes us \u201Cunique\u201D."
