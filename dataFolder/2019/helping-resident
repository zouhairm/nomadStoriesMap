Text: "Do you know durian? Do you like durian? Durian is a variant of fruit from Indonesia.\
  \ The smell is very fragrant. We went to Wonosalam, Jombang, East Java (Indonesia)\
  \ for a University duty. Wonosalam is one of sub district in Indonesia, the biggest\
  \ durian farms. If you a durian lover, you do not wanna go away from Wonosalam.\
  \ \nWhen We did our duty from our lecture for any day, we often visited some village\
  \ chiefs. They said to us that they had a lot of farm products, especially durian,\
  \ they can ate anytime, but they children can't go to school. It caused by they\
  \ didn't have any selling skills, and financial skill. Almost of they are not well\
  \ educated. It made the village chief worried and sad. \nThey need some helps from\
  \ us. We had an idea, we made an event, Durian Party. Before we held Party, we teach\
  \ some resident to make any kinds of food from durian. An then we make a durian\
  \ exibition. We invited residents from Surabaya, Malang, Jogja, and other city to\
  \ visit Durian Party in Wonosalam. And, great! After the Durian party, a lot tourist\
  \ go to Wonosalam, Wonosalam residents got a lot of money from Durian and from tourist."
