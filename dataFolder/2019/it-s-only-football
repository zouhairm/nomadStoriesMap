Text: "The UBahns were not stopping at Brandeburger Tor, the nearest station to the\
  \ iconic Brandenburg Gate in central Berlin where one of the few public screenings\
  \ of the World Cup match was taking place, on Wednesday afternoon (June 27).\n\n\
  Eager German fans, some wearing the country\u2019s red-yellow-black tricolour around\
  \ their shoulders or painted on their cheek, did not seem to mind. Getting off at\
  \ nearby stations such as Friedrichstrasse, most covered the last stretch on foot\
  \ and waited patiently for the security check before being admitted to the large\
  \ viewing area.\nAfter their shock defeat to Mexico, the defending champions had\
  \ made a strong comeback by defeating Sweden. South Korea was supposed to be one\
  \ of the weakest teams and a German victory seemed not only possible but inevitable.\n\
  \nSince before the FIFA World Cup 2018 began earlier this month, German flags had\
  \ sprouted across the nation\u2019s capital: on windows and balconies of multistoried\
  \ buildings, at bars and pubs, on cars. But this was not always the case, claims\
  \ freelance journalist Antje Steibitz.\n\n\u201CWaving the flag during football\
  \ matches became popular only in 2006, when Germany hosted the World Cup,\u201D\
  \ she said. The moment in history is now referred to as sommerm\xE4rchenor, or \u201C\
  summer fairy tale\u201D, when taking pride in one\u2019s German identity, at least,\
  \ with football become okay again.\n\nJana Ehret, a political worker based out of\
  \ Stuttgart in south Germany, confirmed it. \u201CGermans have always been passionate\
  \ about football. But seeing symbols of nationalism, such as flags hanging from\
  \ balconies, was new.\u201D\n\nWhat had prevented it previously? \u201CWe have always\
  \ been uncomfortable about how the Nazis used nationalism and wreaked havoc on Europe\
  \ and the rest of the world,\u201D said Steibitz.\n\nThe Nazis had built a narrow\
  \ definition of what it meant to be German, based on ideas of racial purity. These\
  \ ideas seemed to be staging a comeback of sorts, with the far right political party\
  \ Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) that has been vocally anti-migrant winning 12.6\
  \ per cent of the votes in the German federal elections last year.\n\nThe depressive\
  \ political mood in Berlin could be affecting the mood and performance of the national\
  \ team, speculated journalist Shelley Pascaul in a piece for thelocal.de. Written\
  \ soon after the German team\u2019s loss to Mexico, she quoted sports journalist\
  \ Ralph Guhlke: \u201CAll of Berlin was covered with German flags (during the 2014\
  \ World Cup), and you don\u2019t see many of them this time around. There is no\
  \ party.\u201D\n\nAfter Germany defeated Sweden on June 23, the parties did start\
  \ especially in pubs and bars near Kreuzberg where I watched the match. Even the\
  \ unseasonal rain could not dampen the mood.\n\nDespite the German team not scoring\
  \ till the 90th minute, the fans at Brandenburg Gate on Wednesday cheered loudly\
  \ when six extra minutes were given. But these extra minutes proved to a curse in\
  \ disguise. South Korea scored, twice, and the German team crashed out of the tournament\
  \ in the first round, for the first time in history.\n\n\u201CBut it\u2019s only\
  \ football,\u201D said Steibitz. The flags were folded up and stuck into bags or\
  \ pockets. Disappointed fans walked away hurriedly, quietly. The service from Brandeburger\
  \ Tor had resumed by now."
