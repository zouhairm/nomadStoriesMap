Text: "-Heads, we drive to Antofagasta de la Sierra to explore those unclimbed rock\
  \ formations we heard of; tails, we continue our way South along Ruta 40 as planned-.\
  \ \nThe coin seemed suspended in the air flipping for a few endless seconds before\
  \ falling. \n-Heads!- All my friends exploded, delighted. \nI had an empty feeling\
  \ at the pit of my stomach, thinking about all places mentioned in my thousand page-Argentina\
  \ travel guide, and the only few weeks remaining before my flight back home. And\
  \ Antofagasta de la Sierra was not in my travel guide. Three pairs of eyes fixed\
  \ their gaze on me, I took a deep breath and, pretending to be confident, smiled:\
  \ -That's great! The die is cast, so let's go to Antofagasta!- \nOne instant later\
  \ we were sitting in the old 'chata', as Argentinians call the pick-up, leaving\
  \ the Ruta 40 that stretches North-South the 5000 km length of the country from\
  \ the Bolivian border to the end of Patagonia. In front of us, a winding unpaved\
  \ road directly driving into the Puna, the Andean altiplano more than 3300 m above\
  \ sea level. Directly driving into the unknown.\nWe traveled for hours in a lunar\
  \ landscape without finding any other living creature, with the exception of some\
  \ llamas that seemed indifferent to our presence. What we saw during this trip still\
  \ remains imprinted on my retina: endless lava fields, giant white sand dunes, otherworldly\
  \ colored volcanoes, dreamy salt flats, rock pinnacles of the strangest shapes at\
  \ breathtaking altitudes of 4000 m. It was pitch-dark when we finally arrived in\
  \ Antofagasta, cold and silence were so intense that seemed to fill the air, but\
  \ we were lucky enough to find an old lady willing to sell us some delicious home-made\
  \ 'empanadas'.\nThe next day, remembering our main goal here, we left the village\
  \ to explore some rock canyons that extended over kilometers. The air was thin up\
  \ in the Puna and we were not feeling in our best shape, but we managed to climb\
  \ some cracks symmetrically cutting the canyon walls, without knowing if somebody\
  \ had climbed up there before. Under the limpid sky, night temperatures dropped\
  \ to -10\xB0C and, even if we had brought our tents and warm sleeping bags, we were\
  \ infinitely thankful to a shepherd that offered us to sleep in his hut. We were\
  \ never the same ones after leaving Antofagasta and continuing our trip along the\
  \ Ruta 40; we had overcome our fears and embraced the unknown. Neither it was our\
  \ pick-up, which became 'apunao' -probably due to the dust and the lack of oxygen-\
  \ and broke down a few hours later in the middle of nowhere. But that is another\
  \ story."
