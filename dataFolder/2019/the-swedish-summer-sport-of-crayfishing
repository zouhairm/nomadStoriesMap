Text: "For the residents with homes peppered across M\xF6rt\xF6, an island in the\
  \ Swedish Archipelago, crayfishing comes just once a year. In fact, it\u2019s a\
  \ very civilized and methodical process, this choosing of who gets to fish and when.\
  \ The neighbors each reserve a weekend, usually in July or August, when the weather\
  \ is warm and the rain has mellowed. Last summer, temperatures hit a record high\
  \ and forest fires seared through the north. But on the breezy, remote island about\
  \ an hour away from Stockholm by ferry, the heat was dreamy for swimming and optimal\
  \ for catching crayfish. \n\nI was invited there by a friend of a friend, Anna,\
  \ whose parents built the summer home from the ground up when she was a little girl.\
  \ One story tall but perched on a cliff, the wallpapered and shag carpeted home\
  \ overlooks untouched water. The walk straight down to the water is rocky but quick,\
  \ and a second path shielded by wispy trees leads you to another side of the lake.\
  \ A small guest house, with space for just a bed and washroom, awaits. \n\nWe arrive\
  \ together on a Friday and unpack her cooler: cheese, bread, cucumbers, yogurt,\
  \ and coffee for breakfast; halloumi, avocados, arugula, buns for the fried halloumi\
  \ sandwiches we make the afternoon before I leave; three bars of Marabou chocolate.\
  \ Later that evening, we follow a narrow dirt path that kisses the water, etched\
  \ into the earth from years Anna and her siblings ran back and forth from their\
  \ house to the neighbors'. Johannes, her childhood friend, had recruited six friends\
  \ from the city to join the crayfish operation. His home, where he lives year-round\
  \ with his girlfriend, had been remodeled since his childhood: a long dining table;\
  \ wooden chairs with white cowhides draped over each one; an entertainment room\
  \ with a record player. After running through the game plan for the evening, we\
  \ divide the equipment and follow the same dirt path, this time taking it through\
  \ the woods to a different end of the lake, where two small paddle boats wade gently.\
  \ \n\nA friend of Johannes places a wooden cutting board on the ground, pulls a\
  \ whole fish out of a red cooler, and starts hacking away \u2014 bait. The rest\
  \ of us begin packaging the fish pieces into small plastic crates, attaching those\
  \ to larger crates that will capture the fish. These materials are used just once\
  \ a year, which probably means they\u2019ve been around a while. Johannes keeps\
  \ them in storage until beginning preparations for the annual sport. \n\nI crawl\
  \ into a boat and join two new friends, one tasked with paddling, and we set off\
  \ as the night air begins to cool. One by one, I attach a sponge-like charm to the\
  \ wire linked chain attached to the plastic crates. That piece floats on the top\
  \ of the water, indicating later where we\u2019ve dropped the chambers. Our team\
  \ takes the perimeter of the left side of the lake. Another group goes further out,\
  \ to the other end. Once all the lines are dropped, we wait. \n\nDinner is prepared:\
  \ steak, smoked salmon, boiled potatoes, tomato salad, homemade mayonnaise and pesto\
  \ and garlic aioli. Cans of beer (and Carlsberg, a famous non alcoholic beer) line\
  \ the center of the table, a Swedish centerpiece. We eat chewy candy and chocolate\
  \ and drink coffee for dessert, before pulling up our socks and tugging on rubber\
  \ boots to check back on the crayfish. We split up again, taking the boats out and\
  \ pulling up the chambers to replace the bait pods, checking to see how many fish\
  \ have been captured. By this time, midnight, the sun has finally set and it's our\
  \ headlamps that make the water glimmer. Anna and I go to bed before the check-in\
  \ is done, which we learn the next day is just the first of three. Boiling the crayfish\
  \ in a traditional broth of dill seed would follow, a ritual that begins just before\
  \ nine in the morning and won\u2019t be complete until close to seven. The decorations\
  \ come out around noon (those, too, look like relics of the 1970s). New cans of\
  \ beer are set in the refrigerator to chill."
