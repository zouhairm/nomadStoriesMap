  \ Ocean, Crete, Greece\u2019s largest island, will unexpectedly dazzle all your\
  \ senses in the most nonchalant of ways. More unexpectedly to spectate are its ancient\
  \ ruins , Venetians castles and otherworldly monasteries. This remarkable island\
  \ is richly infused with a beguiling history and culture, that seems to  permeate\
  \ your entire being as you start to explore the area. One of the earliest known\
  \ human civilisations of our world originated here, the Minoan\u2019s. In fact,\
  \ the archaeological site of Knossos still endures today near Heraklion and is a\
  \ must see for both \u201CIndiana Jones\u201D and archaeophile fans alike. It has\
  \ an alluring mystery that leaves one curious to know more. From the diversity of\
  \ its culture and those that once occupied Crete, the Romans, Byzantines, the Ottoman\
  \ Empire, all the way to its awe-inspiring, natural beauty. There is plenty to be\
  \ discovered, so much so that my ten days of  holiday was not nearly enough to fully\
  \ experience this fascinating place. How it is perfectly and proportionately surrounded\
  \ by the majesty of the \u201CWhite Mountains\u201D, an outdoor nature lover\u2019\
  s ultimate idea of bliss. These local mountain ranges and gorges offer a brilliant\
  \ hiking and walking experience too!\nI had almost no expectation as to what to\
  \ anticipate since my mom\u2019s boyfriend kindly offered to pay for my trip as\
  \ part of her sixtieth Birthday celebrations. Personally, I was far more excited\
  \ at the prospect of simply spending time with my Mom whom I had not seen for a\
  \ few years than sightseeing. Since we as a family hail from South Africa, my mom\
  \ had often compared Crete\u2019s unparalleled beauty to that of our native land.\
  \ It is unequivocally true that Crete is very beautiful indeed and that has something\
  \ to offer almost every type of traveller. From the curious seeker wanting to unearth\
  \ its hidden charms, to the exhausted professional needing to re attune to their\
  \ body\u2019s natural rhythms on the sandy beaches of Crete. It offers something\
  \ for a wide variety of travellers, including those with young families, as a lot\
  \ of the resorts offer an all-inclusive deal, freeing up that much needed time for\
  \ parents to fully unwind. There are different ways to get to Crete, and some choose\
  \ to get to there by Ferry from Piraeus (the port of Athens) though I decided to\
  \ fly in from Athens. Arriving into Chania airport that day was a quick flight,\
  \ so quick that I hardly had the time to finish my coffee in the air before we were\
  \ preparing to land again. Crete is typically what one would expect when it comes\
  \ to a paradise like island, though this is just one facet of what it has to offer\
  \ the intrepid explorer. More than its Mediterranean climate and azure like waters,\
  \ it offers rural enchantment that seems to engage your soul the minute you begin\
  \ exploring this vibrant island. Just stopping to watch the local Shepard attempt\
  \ to usher his mountain goats into their pen is an experience as you travel along\
  \ the rural farm roads and pass through many a local village. \nI found part of\
  \ its charm down to its humble and welcoming nation of people. Every meal at each\
  \ taverna dutifully ends off its dining experience with either a local dessert or\
  \ glass of Raki, that is \u201Cinsisted\u201D upon to enjoy for free. Freshly baked\
  \ breads adorn the taverna tables where the accepted etiquette is to swirl the bread\
  \ into a delicious elixir of olive oil & balsamic vinegar. All the while the entire\
  \ extended family is present, hardworking and devoted, ensuring a most authentic\
  \ Cretan occasion has been enjoyed by its travelling guests. One can\u2019t help\
  \ and wonder with a deep sense of reverie what else there may be yet to discover\
  \ on this island, as well as what stories remain here still to be told by its good-natured\
  \ people."
