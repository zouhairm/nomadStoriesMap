Text: "I have scuba-dived the Great Barrier Reef. Walked alongside Komodo dragons.\
  \ Jumped out of a plane in the Australia. Trekked the Great Wall of China. Walked\
  \ on the Panama Canals. Climbed Africa's tallest mountain. Rode the sand dunes of\
  \ the Sahara. Summitted the basecamp of the almighty Everest. But never have I stood\
  \ transfixed watching a human body burn.\n \nEnter Varanasi - the oldest and holiest\
  \ places in the world where the spiritual and physical worlds combine beautifully.\
  \ \nIt is here where I experienced the physical India of my imagination. The India\
  \ that is one of the most colourful and fascinating places on earth. It was frantic\
  \ and intense, colourful and chaotic. The tuks tuks, the people, the honking, the\
  \ smell and the heat. It all came together so fast and powerful in a rather wild\
  \ and uncontrolled way. \n \nIt is also here where I experienced the spiritual India\
  \ of my imagination. It was sacred, soulful and spectacular. For people of all faiths,\
  \ a pilgrimage to the famous Ghats is among the most important trip that one can\
  \ take. It is home to the Hindu belief that if a deceased\u2019s ashes are laid\
  \ in the Ganges, their soul will be transported to heaven and escape the cycle of\
  \ rebirth. Some even come to die. \nTo be able to bathe in the Ganges river in the\
  \ holy water to wash away their sins is something not only sacred to do but scared\
  \ to watch. \n\nAt dusk I made my way down to the Ghats navigating through the narrow\
  \ space between houses.  There were alleyways and lanes crammed with stalls, shops,\
  \ homes, people, animals, cow shit, garbage and flies. It smelled of urine, heat,\
  \ dirt, and disgust. In every nook and cranny, food is being cooked, sold, and eaten.\
  \ There was always something being carried on top of someone's head and someone\
  \ about to be swindled. Kids yelling at other kids. Mother yelling at those kids\
  \ and a man hacking as if he wanted to rid his lungs. \n \nIt was an overload of\
  \ my senses and I was ready for the rollercoaster.\n\nArriving at the Ghats, the\
  \ sun was still chaperoning the sky and there was a sea of men in the river bathing\
  \ and praying. Women washing their clothes, cows basking in the cool water of the\
  \ river, and tourist takings pictures. There was an explicable sense of calmness\
  \ among all the frenzied action taking place. I was captivated. \n\nFast-forward\
  \ 90 minutes. The air became cool, my shadow made an appearance and darkness began\
  \ to creep in.  I regretted not bringing a sweater. \nThe shore is lined with mini\
  \ campfires and the smell of ashes overcame the night sky.  \nHypnotised by the\
  \ reds and orange dancers, I moved closer and was startled by a tall Indian man\
  \ who wave me down and said \u201CNo pictures\u201D \nIn that moment I realised\
  \ what was before my eyes. They were not campfires. There were no smores and no\
  \ ghost stories to be told. There was a body. It was wrapped in a white sheet allowing\
  \ you to see the shape of its head, feet and the curvature of its tiny frame. It\
  \ was a body burning. \n\nFar in the distance were the sounds of bells clinking\
  \ and people talking. The language is unfamiliar, but the sounds of sorrow were\
  \ deafening. There were bodies everywhere and they were all burning. I counted 20\
  \ along the sacred steps. Was I in a movie? Where was the plane crash? Is help on\
  \ the way?\n\nI was shocked, paralyzed and unprepared. Not many people ever in their\
  \ life witness a cremation and here I was standing in Varanasi watching someone\
  \ burn away. I felt like an intruder. I felt like I didn\u2019t have a right to\
  \ watch this and that I was a monster. I started to cry. Tears flowed down my face\
  \ and I closed my eyes, but I could still hear and smell death. \n \nAfter a few\
  \ minutes of standing there, and what really felt like a lifetime, I heard an English-speaking\
  \ man next to me say to his companion \u201CI\u2019m ready to go now\u201D \nI whispered\
  \ to myself. I am too ."
