Text: "My feet ached and got blistered but my backpack and I mad it to the end of\
  \ the road. Seeing the golden sunrise every morning rise between the mountains and\
  \ knowing that waking up early is so rewarding by all the nature that surrounded\
  \ me. The sound of my chunky trekking boots with every step I took on the gravel\
  \ made me realize that I was actually doing something I loved and I did not want\
  \ to end.\n\nI could hear the stillness and as the morning routine of the locals\
  \ who had farms to attend to and the smell of coffee brew made me so weak that I\
  \ had to stop for a sip. I woke up everyday not knowing what kind of trail lies\
  \ ahead of me so I simply prayed for it to be challenging and fulfilling at the\
  \ same time because as I was not looking for an easy way out. Once I was so concentrated\
  \ on my own self thoughts I was walking in the wrong direction and a local woman\
  \ called me out and showed me the right path.\n\nI met people from the UK, Spain,\
  \ Netherlands, Canada, Italy and Germany and all over the globe all walking to an\
  \ unknown destination, I was so proud I was able to communicate in Spanish with\
  \ some of them and mostly in English where we had some nice conversations about\
  \ some ideas of life. I would follow the sound of water so I could ease my sweat\
  \ and rest my soul for a while and wherever there was a river I was in it in no\
  \ time no matter how numb my skin was.\n\nOne day passing through a small village\
  \ in Las Herrer\xEDas I spotted some children playing volleyball and since I train\
  \ volleyball I ended up forming small teams and we started enjoying the sunset together\
  \ along with their families who were chatting in the side, after we were tired and\
  \ th game ended one of the mothers prepared tortilla de patatas for us to share,\
  \ it was such a nice gesture I did not expect. The people were friendly in ways\
  \ I can't describe.\n\nThe meals were great, a lot of wine and paella made my days\
  \ and the laughter that came from nowhere, the whole vibe was insane. It felt so\
  \ easy talking to people and becoming their friend for that time. We were all living\
  \ like locals but not in our home country as we were pilgrims walking on a foreign\
  \ land. \n\nMy Camino is over, I spent my last day in finisterre, it feels like\
  \ there is no end although this place means to be the end of land. I will never\
  \ forget how mesmerized I felt seeing the blue ocean in front of me so wide and\
  \ infinite that my eyes were not capable to fit it all in. My journey last Summer\
  \ was a blessing and I am finding a way everyday to not have one citizenship that\
  \ makes me identified but i am for being a global citizen, making connections wherever\
  \ I go and creating small families from my little adventures."
