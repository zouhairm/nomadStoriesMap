Text: "Have you experienced something tender? Someone you ignore. Someone who was\
  \ present for a small time in your life but changed your way of thinking.\nIt was\
  \ Chu for me.\nFirst some perspective. I am a Geek, Nerd who was out on his first\
  \ solo \u2018Adventure\u2019 trip, mostly inspired by Julia Roberts in \u2018Eat,\
  \ Pray, Love.\u2019 I too wanted to discover myself. Alas, I don\u2019t have a plethora\
  \ of wasted cash, so I chose the Hills of Pelling, a small Village in Sikkim, India\
  \ instead of Rome or Indonesia.\nIt was the 3rd day of my trip. I had hauled my\
  \ bulky body out of bed and forced myself to explore the Mountains albeit after\
  \ lunch. I remember it was around 4 pm. I had been walking for about an hour or\
  \ two.\nThe road I was on was somewhat deserted, not a solitary soul or car in sight.\
  \ I was surrounded by the Forest on one side and the Steep hills on the other. Suddenly\
  \ I noticed a small slightly steep off the path leading into the Forest.\nThe path\
  \ seemed strangely clear, with no overgrowths. I stood there trying to decide on\
  \ my next step, contemplating a spontaneous decision. \n\u201CYou want to go in\u201D\
  \ I jumped in shock and swiftly bringing my arms up to defend myself from the vicious\
  \ creature.\nAn embarrassed laugh was followed by what I can only describe as mirth\
  \ at my situation. A small girl, not more than five was standing there, her hand\
  \ concealing her smile.\nI straightened up trying to regain some composure and smartly\
  \ walked into the abyss, without acknowledging my small companion who had started\
  \ following me.\n\u201CHi, I\u2019m Chu. I live here. Are you from the Plains?\"\
  \ the little girl spoke in one go.\n\u201CYes\u201D \nWe walked in silence for the\
  \ next few minutes. I noticed the Beautiful Flora of Pelling. The Trees hundreds\
  \ of Years old were standing tall covered in Green Vines. They bore small flowers,\
  \ crimson, blue, yellow. Small squirrels and rodents seemed to be thoroughly interested\
  \ in us for a few seconds before just ignoring us altogether. The road had a softness\
  \ to it owing to the recent showers and the Growing Moss. I was tempted to walk\
  \ on the velvety surface barefoot.\nSuddenly a melodious sound, music flew in my\
  \ ears. Chu had started playing a small Flute. The sound felt eerily familiar and\
  \ soothing. The lush surrounding seemed to sway with her music.\nWe walked on in\
  \ silence, basking in the Sound of her music. At long last, I saw a small rivulet\
  \ in front. As I approached it, the soft music stopped unexpectedly. An uncanny\
  \ silence filled the Forest.\n\u201CDon\u2019t go to the Water\u201D Chu swiftly\
  \ gripped my hand and jerked me. The concern in her voice stumped me. I looked at\
  \ her small face, crumpled with worry. \u201CIt\u2019s bad please don\u2019t go,\u201D\
  \ Chu cried.\nHer crestfallen and terrified expression broke my Resolve. I knelt\
  \ down and took the petite girl in my arms. The Silent and beautiful Forest bore\
  \ witness to the heart-wrenching wails of fear and sadness from the dear soul.\n\
  It was after what felt like hours that Chu stopped. I was shocked but kept my Questions\
  \ to myself. The sky was darkening and a Deep glum was settling on the Forest. I\
  \ decided to end my adventure. \nWe walked out of the Forest in silence, Chu gripping\
  \ my hand. It felt oddly personal and Gratifying that the little child though me\
  \ Responsible enough to seek refuge from me.\nWe reached the road, and it took us\
  \ 5 minutes to reach her Home. I saw her run into her house and emerge with a woman\
  \ in tow. Chu softly nudged me and presented her Flute to me.\nThe woman her Mother\
  \ thanked me for bringing Chu home. I left the Small broken Cottage, with the flute\
  \ in hand. The Flute still sits on my mantle. I have learned to play it. I never\
  \ met Chu again. But she made me believe in myself. \nIf a little girl can see,\
  \ well and seek protection from me. Maybe I\u2019m not that doomed.\nFinally, maybe\
  \ do something Spontaneous. It changes you."
