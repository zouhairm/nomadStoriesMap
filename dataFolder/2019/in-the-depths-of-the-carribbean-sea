Text: "I was sitting next to a chicken fraught with anticipation on my way to the\
  \ Nicaragua-Honduras border; pondering quietly in my cornered seat of an old yellow\
  \ school bus. I too was filled with anticipation -probably not for the same reasons-\
  \  but anxious nonetheless. You see, I was on my way to a small piece of land off\
  \ the coast of northern Honduras. Utila was known as one of the scuba-diving capitals\
  \ of the world and I was going for just that. Reluctantly eager to take my travel\
  \ journey underwater.\n\nAfter a six hour bus ride, one night in Tegucigalpa and\
  \ two flights, I finally landed on the tiny tropical paradise. Scuba-diving was\
  \ going to be my life for the next week and I was expecting to befriend all the\
  \ critters of the sea. \nReady to make the most of it, I settled into my perfectly\
  \ dingy room and picked up my books for the next day- ready to dive in. \n\nAfter\
  \ three full days of being confined to a classroom, diving day came and I was elated.\
  \ With a full tank, newly adjusted flippers and an alarming amount of confidence\
  \ I waddled my way across the deck, into the water. I followed the divemaster and\
  \ immersed myself in the sea life around me: I made my way into a school of fish,\
  \ analysed patterned corals and watched a hesitant eel pop out of its cave as sharks\
  \ swam by. The ocean was my oyster.  It was remarkable. \n\nSo remarkable in fact,\
  \ that I had completely disregarded nearby divers and unexpectedly hit one in the\
  \ face. I made a futile attempt to apologize and swam to the surface. We got onto\
  \ the boat and after a verbal apology from my end, we didn\u2019t stop talking.\
  \ Back on land we laid on the hammocks, skipped the small talk and went straight\
  \ for our passions and fears. The epitome of an overly written romantic meet-cue.\
  \ \n\nBut alas, life isn\u2019t a romance novel. Or is it? \n\nAfter three days\
  \ of courting, we went our separate ways with no expectations for the future. Half\
  \ a year later, after limited exchanges, the underwater stranger \u2018stopped by\u2019\
  \ on his way home. We spent a couple of days in bliss; again with no expectations\
  \ for the future. This time, however, our exchanges were anything but limited. After\
  \ a year of phone calls, letters and an insane time difference we were reunited\
  \ in his homeland, Australia. Four years later he\u2019s moving back with me to\
  \ my homeland, Mexico. We have officially become each other\u2019s futures and I\
  \ can confidently say, I did not expect to find my human in the depths of the Caribbean\
  \ Sea."
