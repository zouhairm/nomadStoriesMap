Text: "It was a small step onto the train but a giant leap into the unknown as I boarded\
  \ my one-way towards Bruges, the most well preserved medieval town in the whole\
  \ of Belgium. With architecture from the 1100's towering above the streets, remnants\
  \ of an old world are forced to meet the new world in this fairytale place, or so\
  \ I had heard. And, now I was on my way to find out. \n\nThe train ride there from\
  \ the airport consisted of small talk with the person in the seat next to me over\
  \ what had brought each of us to Bruges, as is usual with anywhere you travel. Though\
  \ I didn't mind to chat because the view looking out of the window wasn't entirely\
  \ captivating. Just miles of empty acres across a farming landscape. 'A fairytale\
  \ town, here?' I though. 'In Belgium?'\n\n\"I had seen a film shot in Bruges and\
  \ wanted to check out the filming location.\" I said to inform the other person\
  \ of my travels.\n\"I'm here to hide out.\" they replied and grinned. I'm guessing\
  \ they had seen the film too. \n\nWe went on chatting for the rest of the train\
  \ ride about ourslves. The person wasn't actually heading to Bruges to hide out\
  \ but was a local fulfilling their daily commute. What they had said earlier was\
  \ a quote from the film and a joke. The train soon connected with the docking station.\
  \ I was wished a farewell by the local and ready to depart into the unknown, or\
  \ atleast the semi-unknown. You see, I had seen the film, In Bruges, and was aware\
  \ of where I was going but yet it still felt new to be there. Not just as a place\
  \ I had never been to on a map before but in a time I had never been. A town build\
  \ nearly 1,000 years ago where the presence of history trickles down like rain from\
  \ the tallest rooftops. A time before the post-modern world. Somethings that now\
  \ that it is here can sometimes feel inescapable or hard to get away from.\n\nUpon\
  \ arrival at first there was this big dual carriage way with rickshaws that would\
  \ transport travelers and pedastrians alike into the city by horse drawn carriages.\
  \ For me, this horse drawn carriage ride was the first feeling of being in a fairytale\
  \ place and once I'd got my feet on the ground in the town proper it began to feel\
  \ other-wordly. The cobble stone streets, the gothic churches, the canals, and even\
  \ the swans; everything had an allure of charm. Although post modern cities have\
  \ sky scrappers and other interestingly designed buildings that preform feats of\
  \ architectural gymnastics, these modern buildings can seem to exude a type of arrogance.\
  \ The sort of, 'Look what I can do.' person you knew growing up. Whereas many pre-modern\
  \ buildings in older cities of the world were designed with the intention to put\
  \ God in aw. Historical cities are authentithic yet venerable. Something that in\
  \ the modern world can be harder to experience as more and more things are made\
  \ in a hurry only to be used once or twice and throw away or replaced. In my opinion,\
  \ pre-modern buildings and towns reflect something about existence that post-modern\
  \ environments 'square-out'. \n\nSince arriving I've heard from the locals that\
  \ all of Belgium is great and my first stop in Bruges, the most well preserved medieval\
  \ town in the whole country, didn't disappoint."
