Text: "What folly was it on my part, to know that Rome was not built in a day as I\
  \ do, yet think I could see it all in a day? Dear Reader, some of the things I have\
  \ done make me think that I only exist so that you can learn from my innumerable\
  \ mistakes. If I am honest, \u201Csee what I do, then do exactly the opposite\u201D\
  \ is the only counsel I can give you here! Indeed, the above title of my Rome day\
  \ trip captures, perfectly, the incompleteness of my visit to Rome, where seeing\
  \ all the key sights is concerned. Perhaps, the only redeeming feature is that,\
  \ prior to that trip, I read extensively about Rome\u2019s history, culture, innovations,\
  \ and contributions to the world. I am thus better informed than I otherwise would\
  \ have been. My main purpose for travelling is so that I can learn different people\u2019\
  s ways of life, for the sake of my own personal development. \n\nI Came...\n\nOn\
  \ my short visit, I arrived at Rome Fiumicino at 0945am and my departure for London\
  \ Gatwick was at 2200pm, thus I had exactly 11 hours to see Rome as I had to be\
  \ back at the Airport at 2100pm at the latest. I therefore wanted the fastest mode\
  \ of transport into Rome from the Airport, Fiumicino is 50 kilometres from the city\
  \ centre. Taxis are most likely very fast but they would have been too expensive\
  \ for me, EUR40.00, the bus would have been the cheapest, about EUR8.00, but also\
  \ the slowest as it takes about an hour excluding waiting times, and because it\
  \ is always full, there is a long queue and you might miss 3 buses before you get\
  \ on one. I was thus forced to go on the Leonardo Express, the train service between\
  \ the Airport and Roma Termini in Rome Central. It costs EUR14.00 and takes about\
  \ 30 to 45 minutes to get into Rome. All these things I am describing to you at\
  \ length, took me about 5 minutes to figure out as soon as I cleared immigration.\
  \ In the shortest possible time, I had made my decision and at exactly 1045am I\
  \ was at standing at Roma Termini in Central Rome studying the Rome Metro Map: General\
  \ Kanhutu plotting his campaign!                                               \
  \                  \n\nI was aware of my time limits, so I had already bought my\
  \ Roma and the Museo Vatican Passes online, if I couldn\u2019t see everything I\
  \ wanted to see, at least I was guaranteed to see the unmissable of the unmissables.\
  \ The Musei Vatican Pass costs EUR20.00, and gives you access to all the Vatican\
  \ Museums as well as St Peter\u2019s Basilica. The Roma Pass costs EUR30.00 and\
  \ gives you a day\u2019s travel on all public transport and access to two Museums\
  \ in Rome. I had chosen the Colosseum and the Galleria Borghese as the two worthy\
  \ of my attention. The other sights such as the Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps and\
  \ the Pantheon are best seen from the outside anyway. So, I was confident my day\
  \ in Rome would not be a disaster as far as sightseeing was concerned.\n\nI Saw\
  \ (Sort of)\n\n\u201CMy name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, Commander of the Armies\
  \ of the North, General of the Felix Legions and loyal servant to the true emperor,\
  \ Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife... And I\
  \ will have my vengeance in this life or the next.\u201D The first place I just\
  \ had to see was the Colosseum. Blame it on popular culture for I am not immune,\
  \ so I was going to re-enact, inside the Colosseum, the scene from Ridley Scott\u2019\
  s Gladiator, where Russell Crowe says the above lines, and it could not wait! \n\
  \nFrom Roma Termini to Colosseum on the Metro is a very short trip; in a few minutes,\
  \ I was transported back to 3 000 years ago, taking pictures around the perimeter\
  \ of this magnificent stadium from antiquity. I was mesmerized by the Triumphal\
  \ Arc and walked around the Colosseum twice before heading to the entrance.  First\
  \ complication: there was an impossibly long queue at Rome\u2019s landmark sight!\
