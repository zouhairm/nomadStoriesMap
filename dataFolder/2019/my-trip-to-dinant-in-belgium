Text: "Belgium is very close to several European capitals such as London, Amsterdam\
  \ or Paris. It's a small country that you probably know especially about chocolate\
  \ and beer. If you\u2019re thinking about where to spend a few days, Dinant, Belgium\
  \ has a lot to see so it can be a good option.\nDinant is a pretty charming city,\
  \ a medieval town in Wallonia, the south of Belgium. Its ambiance is more like a\
  \ provincial town than a capital city. I can describe Dinant as pleasing and very\
  \ photogenic. It reminds me so much about France and Strasbourg because they\u2019\
  ve a similar culture. \nThough it was a short visit, I explored this hidden gem,\
  \ walked through the historic streets and of course I ate a lot of chocolate and\
  \ took some local beer. There are lots of shops selling chocolate because Belgium\
  \ is famous for chocolate. Also, Dinant is renowned for their cookies, and I ate\
  \ quite a few of them. For instance, the Couques de Dinant (the Dinant Cookie or\
  \ Dinant Cake) is very famous. There are a lot of fun and exciting places I also\
  \ visit, such as the Collegiate Church of Our Lady, Adolphe Sax house and I also\
  \ took a stroll along the river Meuse. \nThe Collegiate Church of Our Lady is a\
  \ lovely church very close to the train station. It is a 13th-century Gothic cathedral\
  \ that has a beautiful Gothic style (windows are impressive, sculptures and carvings\
  \ are masterpieces) in quite a small town. Finding it was a delightful surprise.\
  \ I felt at ease with myself because of its calm and serene environment. \nI noticed\
  \ the city\u2019s obsession with saxophones, so I visited the Adolphe house that\
  \ was where I learned that Adolphe Sax the saxophone inventor was born there in\
  \ 1814. A unique itinerary called \"Sax and the City\" lets you discover the city's\
  \ entertaining, musical tribute to its famous son.\nFinally, I took a stroll along\
  \ the river Meuse, and I saw Dinant from a different angle. Cruise boats crisscross\
  \ the river carrying different tourists. Indeed Dinant sparkles along this river\
  \ body.\nIN CONCLUSION\nAre you planning for a weekend getaway? Why explore your\
  \ own country when there are so many other countries to visit. Dinant offers the\
  \ perfect mix of history, culture, chocolate, and beer. It\u2019s a cute little\
  \ town and classic for a weekend getaway. My trip to Dinant is, without doubt, my\
  \ favorite day trip destination in Belgium. I recommend you to lose yourself the\
  \ time of a weekend trip to Dinant. The beauty it holds can blow you away!"
