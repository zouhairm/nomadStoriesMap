Text: "When I went to University in a city almost 300 km away from my hometown, I\
  \ went to share a house with other 14 people who were also in college. Being from\
  \ a country as big as Brazil, I haven\u2019t had the opportunity to visit every\
  \ state yet, but there I lived with people from almost everywhere from Brazil \u2013\
  \ and a few other countries, such as Colombia, USA and Spain. I\u2019ve made some\
  \ great friends and I\u2019ve learned things that not even college would teach me.\n\
  And it was with one of these companions that I have had one of my most memorable\
  \ experiences. Nick, from Chicago, moved to the house during the same time as I\
  \ did, and we soon became friends. He was going to stay in Brazil only for six months\
  \ and was eager to go to as many places as possible. I volunteered as a guide in\
  \ some adventures, being very fond of travelling myself.\nThere was a holiday approaching\
  \ and Nick invited me to go to S\xE3o Paulo. I have lived in S\xE3o Paulo and have\
  \ always loved the city, with its museums, parks, and agitated urban lifestyle,\
  \ so I immediately agreed. We were supposed to stay at a friend\u2019s apartment,\
  \ but things didn\u2019t go as we planned, and we had to look for a hostel. I was\
  \ frustrated at first, but little did I know that at that moment, our trip had its\
  \ turning point. We found a hostel near Vila Madalena, a neighborhood famous for\
  \ its night-life. However, the most interesting part of the journey was the hostel\
  \ itself.\nIn it, were also a French guy who was travelling the world and a whole\
  \ group of native Brazilians, the so-called Indians. Originally from the North region,\
  \ they coincidently were in S\xE3o Paulo for a festival and happened to be at the\
  \ same hostel as we. In our second night there, before dinner, they asked us if\
  \ we minded them having a traditional celebration of their own, and invited us to\
  \ watch, or even join them, if we wanted to. So, intrigued, we decided to stay at\
  \ the hostel and take part at this celebration.\nIt was a religious celebration,\
  \ to honor the position of the Moon \u2013 which is an entity like a God to them\
  \ \u2013 and I feel like it was one of the most touching things I have ever experienced.\
  \ They had traditional music, food and dance from their tribe, and they were so\
  \ open and so kind to let us be part of the celebration, that I will never forget\
  \ what we have experienced. Then, at some point, the celebration became kind of\
  \ spiritual, with prayers directed to the Moon. I don\u2019t consider myself a very\
  \ spiritual person, being an atheist who is not constantly in touch with God. However,\
  \ I can\u2019t deny it was an incredibly spiritual moment. \nAnd then it hit me:\
  \ I was in the biggest city of South America, surrounded by buildings, cars and\
  \ paved streets, and I was still living and experiencing a traditional ritual from\
  \ a native Brazilian tribe, that survived for many years. At the time, I was a History\
  \ undergraduate student, particularly interested in Latin America History. But until\
  \ then, I had not had real contact with natives from my own land. What were the\
  \ chances that due to an invitation from an American friend I would have this incredible\
  \ opportunity? On top of that, in such an unusual place, with people from different\
  \ parts of the globe. \nFrom that moment on, I realized I had to meet my origins.\
  \ It is undeniable that the contact between the Europeans and the Americans brought\
  \ huge changes to the world. Society has changed entirely since then and today it\
  \ is almost impossible to know groups that are completely isolated. Nonetheless,\
  \ there are a few groups that resist and continue to practice ancient rituals, preserving\
  \ their memory, that we can try to know. And ironically, I got to experience this\
  \ in the middle of the biggest city in Brazil. A place where we automatically associate\
  \ with urbanization was the scenario in which I first noticed I should chase my\
  \ own roots, meet my own culture."
