Text: "It was with a level of trepidation I boarded the plane on a dark, early morning;\
  \ a layer of foreboding was lying under any feelings of excitement that may have\
  \ resonated within me. Twenty-six hours later, I found myself alone in a foreign\
  \ country for the first time, staring at a myriad of airport signs in an alphabet\
  \ I didn't recognize, surrounded by a language completely unfamiliar. It was a trip\
  \ I never imagined would happen. Yet, here I was, staring up at the arrival sign\
  \ of Chiang Mai International Airport, swallowing the pending panic welling in my\
  \ throat. Jolted, jetlagged, and as of days prior, jobless, I embarked on my solo\
  \ adventure.\n \nI arrived in Thailand late at night, managing to catch a cheap\
  \ taxi to my hotel before letting the exhaustion wash over me. I knew, if nothing\
  \ else, what my first experience in Thailand needed to be. When dawn arrived, I\
  \ was picked up in a simple sedan by a Thai man named Nikhom - my first true step\
  \ into Thai culture. I was both surprised and comforted by his broken English, but\
  \ still anxious for what was to come.\n \nWe arrived at a small house with lights\
  \ that glowed softly in the early morning sun. It consisted of a single room, the\
  \ bathroom outside being a simple hole in the ground. Approaching the house, I stopped\
  \ short as I finally lay eyes on the reason I was here. Sitting, perfectly poised,\
  \ on a small wooden stool, was the first Buddhist monk I've ever had the pleasure\
  \ of seeing. Draped regally in orange cloth, he accepted my offering of fruit and\
  \ flowers before having me kneel before him. Gifting me a smile, but no words; I'd\
  \ been previously informed he was not allowed to talk to me, but would kindly accept\
  \ my offering. His hands, strong though worn, were clad in skin-colored gloves,\
  \ as touching me was not permitted as well.\n \nThe tradition of Sak Yant, or 'magical\
  \ soul tattoos', have been practiced by Buddhist monks in multiple countries for\
  \ thousands of years. In extremely traditional cases, one could not choose what\
  \ or where their \u201Crod-given\u201D tattoo was or went. I preferred this option,\
  \ having the Monk choose for me. This trip was one of faith and chances. Throwing\
  \ caution to the wind by having something tattooed with no idea what it would actually\
  \ be when it was over was pretty much the theme.\n \nThe metal rod that pierced\
  \ my skin was painful, but the Monk was quick with his work. Only thirty minutes\
  \ later I was kneeling in front of him, holy water sprinkled over my new tattoo\
  \ and being adorned with chanted blessings. I felt proud; the red-rimmed black ink\
  \ was a symbol of what I was doing, where I was going, and what I was hoping to\
  \ achieve, being here. I thanked the Monk in poorly pronounced Thai, my first time\
  \ speaking it since arrival. The Monk turned to my guide and spoke, words calm and\
  \ slow. I couldn't understand, but found myself latched to every word before turning\
  \ to my guide for interpretation.\n \n\"Your tattoo gives you luck and blessings\
  \ for the future. He says it will help guide you on your new journey.\" I looked\
  \ over the dark black etchings, painfully poked into me over a thirty-minute timespan;\
  \ each box had a blessing, each line a different meaning. I felt suddenly empowered.\
  \ Even without knowing the language, I could feel the symbols across my skin, each\
  \ throb of pain seeping its meaning into my soul. My fear that had been so encompassing\
  \ was gone. I was blessed. I was protected.\n \nI didn\u2019t feel alone in my journey\
  \ anymore. I felt brave, and hopeful, stepping out into the wild Thai jungle that\
  \ awaited me. This was my time, my adventure, and my discovery. Blessed and already\
  \ enchanted by everything I had yet to experience, I wasn't going to let anything\
  \ stand in my way."
