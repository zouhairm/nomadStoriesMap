Text: "I close my eyes. \n\nMy heart is beating to the strumming, the clapping, the\
  \ stomping. Their hands and feet must be aching. It doesn\u2019t matter. All that\
  \ matters is the feeling.\_\nIt begins with\_clever fingers that race over the guitar\
  \ strings, strumming the nerves under my skin, awakening my body from a passive\
  \ consciousness. Next, the percussion - the forceful, steady clapping - jarring\
  \ my soul to attention. Then the singing; the searing dips and soaring yodeling\
  \ that makes my heart pound. The woman\u2019s voice is so haunting and passionate,\
  \ my eyes glisten and my chest tightens.\_Finally, the dancers - bringing it all\
  \ together.\n\nHis shoes are blood red and gleaming black patent leather. I am transfixed\
  \ by the thrumming percussion of his heels against the wooden stage. He is a Spanish\
  \ Michael Jackson and he is dancing three feet in front of me; I can see the sweat\
  \ streaking down his temples and the lights gleaming off his slicked back jet black\
  \ hair.\_\n\nShe is alight with an inner fire. I can feel the heat burning her up\
  \ inside, I see it bare on her face; flashes of pain and ecstasy. She is twisting\
  \ her hands, flicking her skirt with scorn and defiance to her nameless lover. Her\
  \ heels click sharply, ta-ta-ta-ta-TA.\_\n\nSuddenly, unexpectedly, it is over.\
  \ Exuberant applause fills the small square room, and then the four performers exit\
  \ like a rush of hot air out of the open door. I feel like a candle that has been\
  \ lit and then extinguished. Is it possible to fall in love with a performance?\
  \ I sit for a moment and let the pieces of myself come back together.\_\n\nI exit\
  \ the room and float out into the bar. She is there, the female dancer. I breathlessly\
  \ tell her, \"You were amazing.\"\n\n\"How long have you been dancing flamenco?\"\
  \n\n\"Four months,\" she says proudly.\n\nMy mouth drops open.\n\nShe departs with\
  \ the guitar player and the Spanish Michael Jackson watches her with dark eyes.\_\
  Outside, the night is dark and lit by streetlights. The air wraps around me like\
  \ a warm, silken embrace. A few of us from the audience linger, not yet ready for\
  \ the magic of the evening to end.\_\n\nTwo young men approach our little group\
  \ like a river, the music from their strumming guitar flowing around us. The dark-haired\
  \ youth is singing, the shorter one is strumming. We follow the sounds of Louise's\
  \ Spanish guitar into the winding stone alleys of Triana, into the heat of Seville\
  \ at midnight.\_ Holding the hands of\_Victor, I twirl in a makeshift salsa, my\
  \ muscles fluid from the rum in my blood, dancing to the rhythm of the guitar and\
  \ my heartbeat. \n\nA shout from a balcony above and we are jarred to a sudden halt.\
  \ An elderly man leans over the iron railing, speaking in the local language but\
  \ in an unmistakable tone of reproof. Victor clasps his hands together and bows\
  \ forward in a universal symbol of deference, apologies streaming from his mouth\
  \ in Spanish syllables.\_ The man nods and lights a cigarette. The embers glow orange\
  \ in the night as he rests his elbows on the balustrade. The man and the boys chat\
  \ amicably for a few minutes, a delightful transition from angry harsh staccato\
  \ to murmured inconsequential exchanges, on a street lit by lamplight.\n\nWe saunter\
  \ into the after-hours flamenco club and take a shot at the bar, Louise and Victor\
  \ scrapping their pockets for bills and change. I make my way through the long,\
  \ narrow entrance, past the open dance floor, to a table on the patio, overlooking\
  \ the river. We are the only foreigners; this is another intimate space of another\
  \ kind. The woman singing is a waitress by day and the women dancing are not performers\
  \ but simply locals who fulfill their passion for flamenco here together. \n\nWe\
  \ stay until 3 am, listening to the singing, joining in on the clapping, even dancing\
  \ one round. As we walk home to our rented apartment, the river beside us reflects\
  \ the brilliance of the\_three-quarter moon."
