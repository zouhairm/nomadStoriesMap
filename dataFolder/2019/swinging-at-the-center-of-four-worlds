Text: "\u201CI should have brought the Dramamine,\u201D I said to my seat buddy as\
  \ we rolled over what felt like the 523rd pothole. I looked out the window of our\
  \ noisy Toyota HiAce in a futile attempt to calm my nausea. \n\nThe car climbed\
  \ an Ecuadorian mountain side so flush with greenery that leaves brushed the windows\
  \ as we drove by hundreds of trees. I was at the center of four worlds \u2013 Amazonas,\
  \ Andes, Coast, and Galapagos Islands. The locals seemed to hold a deeply rooted\
  \ intimacy with their country, a feeling that was palpable in the air and the language.\
  \ \n\nThis trip to the Puyo jungle started on a complete whim. I was living and\
  \ working remotely in Quito when my German roommate insisted that I join her for\
  \ this weekend trip. To convince me, she looked me in the eye and whispered, \u201C\
  La chulla vida, Erica.\u201D \n\nWe learned the Ecuadorian phrase on a walking tour\
  \ around the capitol. Our tour guide, Carolina stopped at a tall bronze statue of\
  \ a dapper older gentleman sporting a huge smile. Standing in front of the towering\
  \ figure, she asked, \u201CHow many lives do each of you have?\u201D \n\nAfter a\
  \ few tired mumblings of \u201Cone\u201D, she continued to explain that in Ecuador,\
  \ they say, \u201CLa chulla vida,\u201D which translates to \u201CYour one life.\u201D\
  \ This motto means approaching life with joy, courage and excitement because you\
  \ only have one chance. Much like the beaming statue of the man dressed to impress,\
  \ life is simply meant to be lived to the fullest.  \n\nReality ripped me out of\
  \ my reverie as we parked at our destination \u2013 a little-known lookout spot\
  \ near the Puyo River. The old car let out a heavy sigh as we began to climb our\
  \ way out of the seats. As I stepped out of the car, a green mountain towered before\
  \ me. \n\n\u201CAround this way!\u201D my enthusiastic tour guide, Leo yelled as\
  \ he hustled around the side of the mountain. Following close behind him, I began\
  \ my ascent up the steep incline, immediately regretting the cigarette I indulged\
  \ in after my morning coffee. Although my breath was wheezy, I continued to step\
  \ one foot in front of the other, having been promised the best view of the Amazon\
  \ after the hike.\n\nAs we reached the top, the path curved to reveal the most magnificent\
  \ panorama of the Puyo River. A winding body of water sparkled before us surrounded\
  \ by a vast canopy of wildlife. \n\nThen, I spotted the swing (if one could even\
  \ call it that). A plank of wood attached to a rope, which hung from a tree nearly\
  \ 200 feet above. When you jumped off the side of the mountain, the swing would\
  \ dangle your body high above the jungle. However, I learned that if I stayed on\
  \ too long, I would get stuck dangling in midair.\n\nI took a step back, shaking\
  \ my head no. Before I could even say anything, Leo decided to demonstrate. Without\
  \ waiting to be buckled in, he hopped on the swing with one foot and pushed off\
  \ the ledge with the other. I screamed involuntarily. By the time he was swinging\
  \ back, my hands were shaking with nerves.  \n\n\u201CSee it\u2019s easy. Don\u2019\
  t you trust me?\u201D he asked in Spanish, gently cupping my hand between both of\
  \ his. \n\n\u201CLa chulla vida\u2026I guess,\u201D I replied with a blush, followed\
  \ by a deep breath. If this was my one life, I needed to let go. In a snap back\
  \ to reality, I started climbing the steep incline in preparation to jump off the\
  \ ledge. Leo wrapped a rope around my waist to secure me into the swing, though\
  \ nothing about this felt secure. \n\nOn the first swing, I wanted to close my eyes,\
  \ throw up, cry, anything to get my feet back on the ground. But the beauty was\
  \ overwhelming. The Amazon extended far beyond what my eyes could see, far beyond\
  \ what I could ever imagine. Looking closely, I could see treetops wiggle with the\
  \ movement of countless creatures below. By the second swing, I was beaming like\
  \ the bronze statue of a man living his best life, except I was a young woman finding\
  \ hers."
