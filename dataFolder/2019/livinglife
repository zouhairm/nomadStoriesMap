Text: It was the last day of my 2nd year exam...everone my faltmates were sitting
  & one of my friend suggested to travel & enjoy so we selected to go Mumbai, i have
  never been to any place before so i said yes, we took sudden train at night we were
  three friends & meanwhile we contacted our college friend who stay in Mumbai, he
  welcomed us on phone & booked a hotel for us, we reached up in morning, checked
  in, took a bit rest & then had a bath &. when we went out our first experience in
  Mumbai it was humid & hot too...we all sweat up again, first day we started with
  Spritual journey we visited Siddhivinayak temple most famous it was huge & there
  was some majical in that temple the moment i entered it made all of us relaxed,
  i think the positive vibes we got in ourselves, than we had upto Haji Ali Masjid
  near by water, we stand nearby rocks & enjoyed the waves heading on us...as we were
  fighting with them, we prayed there & moved & there was nearby a market where you
  get all kind of stuff at cheap rates as its called Mumbai's Chor Bazaar, we bought
  some stuff & then we planned to visit Marine drive in evening so we went there...sit
  on the rocks under sky full of stars shining & there we relaised why Mumbai is said
  city of dreams as there are big stories born their of many stars & everyperson wants
  to be there between those stars....we sat there chit chat about life & the place,
  the moment was amazing, sea waves coming striking with rocks & that loving air made
  everything majical but our enjoyment didn't last for long as police camed there
  & they told us to go as it was late so like good citizens we moved & went back hotel
  next morning we started with heading our local friends who live in a chaul area
  nearby...old colonies, we haed up there to call him at his place, he took us his
  friends & first he give local tour of his chaul it was like old bolywood movies,
  than he told me why you guys not visit celebrities places, i meet you in evening,
  i think he had some work so we took auto & head to bandra at bolywood celebs places
  we didn't met them but it was like a dream to come & see their place where they
  live & their were many like us as it was crowded &   almost everday it remain crowded,
  then we went to Juhu Beach, we sat there for some time enjoying hot sand & sea,
  it was like spa to us relaxing, later in evening we planned to head up pubs & bar
  as it was saturday night & its said that mumbai nightlife is amazing & so we & our
  local friends went there, we had some drinks & had dance, there when we were at
  bar table we met some strangers from different places & countries, we enjoyed there
  company & now it was late so we took taxi to get back hotel, in meanwhile one of
  our local friend told us about redlight areas where prostitutes live & one of our
  friend wicked mind said yes we will go there & had our night more amazing...i think
  he was high & virgin too...so we went there...i was scared & the one who was against
  but majority wins & we went there our friends enjoyed & it all gone safe we went
  back hotel next moring our last day in Mumbai nothing much time we had & we woke
  up late as we were drinked a wholelot last night & had train in evening so we took
  our lunch we visted an Irani hotel & ordered some non veg food it was damn delecious,
  i had never tasted such spices & curry before,i appreciated honour for food & moved
  to railway station, we took a local train to reach our train junction that experience
  was too amazing, At last i wanto say Mumbai if you hadn't Mumbai street & streetfood,
  beaches, nightlife, redlight & local trains you miss the real mumbai, People say
  it dream city, but while returning back we all were having a whole lot memories
  with us. Thankyou.
