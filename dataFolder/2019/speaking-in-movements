Text: "By a young age, I had been fortunate enough to travel the world through volunteer\
  \ trips, work, and study abroad. From East Africa to South America, to Europe, I\
  \ had gathered many beautiful experiences in my short life. While currently living\
  \ in Costa Rica, I went home for the holidays. My dad asks me, of everything you\
  \ have seen and experienced through your travels what is one moment that really\
  \ sticks out. I sit, and try to allow all my experiences to flash before me...the\
  \ one experienced that came first to mind of my travels was one in Uganda. I respond\
  \ to my dad, \"well, this one time I fell into a poop hole in Uganda.\" Everyone\
  \ at the table gave me a look of confusion and disgust. Half disgust from the mere\
  \ content of what I said and half from the fact I've traveled the world and that\
  \ was the best thing I could come up with. At the time, I couldn't believe it was\
  \ the first thing that came out of my mouth but after some reflection, I knew exactly\
  \ why that was the first thing that came to mind.\n\nTraveling changes the way you\
  \ view the world. Of course, I could go on and on about being pushed outside of\
  \ my comfort zone and the beauty of humanity, but travel is more than that. Travel\
  \ changes our reactions to things, travel puts us in situations where we can sink\
  \ or swim, and this is determined by how we react. So here is how this story goes...\n\
  \nThe nine other people I was traveling with and I were enjoying a quiet evening\
  \ at a volunteer center in the outskirts of Kabale, Uganda.\nWe all had sleeping\
  \ pads on the cement ground and were sharing the wonders of Nutella. Like any other\
  \ day, in any other part of the world, I went to use the bathroom. The bathroom\
  \ where we were staying was a mud hut with a no lights and hole buried into the\
  \ ground. It was dark and I am clumsy to begin with. I had my head lamp in hand\
  \ and with some steps I took the light wasn't exactly where I needed it to be...whatever,\
  \ right? I entered the bathroom, take a look at the hole, walk towards it, and next\
  \ thing I know, half my leg is submerged down the hole...\n\nIn disbelief on what\
  \ just happened I pull my leg out of the hole, shine the light, and see poop just\
  \ smeared across my leg and foot. I couldn't believe it. Having no source of water,\
  \ I walk back to my friends. I stand at the door, not knowing how to explain what\
  \ had just happened. Finally, someone asks what the smell is. There I am, standing,\
  \ covered in poop, guilty as charged. I burst out laughing, and so does everyone\
  \ else. We put together all our toilet paper, hand wipes, soaps, water, and sanitizer\
  \ to alleviate the situation. \n\nIt's the small moments (or big in this case) of\
  \ discomfort where we have no choice but to react. The question isn't if we will\
  \ react or not, because as  humans I can say with confidence that we react to everything,\
  \ the real question is how we will react. This doesn't just apply while traveling,\
  \ this applies to everything in life. If learning the power of reaction took me\
  \ traveling half way across the world to fall into a poop hole, so be it. Travel\
  \ isn't always grand enchanting stories, it's how we greet life."
