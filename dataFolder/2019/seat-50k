Text: "\"Don't leave the airport,\" my fathers assertive tone echoed throughout my\
  \ mind \"The Philippines is a nasty place.\" My lips pursed as I tried to tame a\
  \ cheeky grin. I was headed to New Zealand, and he wasn't as thrilled as I was about\
  \ the twenty-hour layover in Manila, capital city of the Philippines forever haunted\
  \ by violent crime.\n\nNonetheless, the journey was to be savoured, and I intended\
  \ to revel in every last drop.\n\nI picked up what resembled headphones from the\
  \ stone age off of the ripped faux-leather chair and took my seat by the window.\
  \ In the face of drug trade, human trafficking and the highest murder rate of Southeast\
  \ Asia, I was fearless\u200A-\u200Aa quality I inherited from my mother (though\
  \ my father quietly cursed her for it).\n\n\"Want one?\" my eyes fluttered open\
  \ as they met the hands of the Filipino woman next to me: in them, a colourful array\
  \ of sweets. I smirked and picked a sour peach out of the clear plastic pouch.\n\
  \nHelen shared with me a detailed glimpse of her past; she divorced her husband\
  \ under suspicions that he had been two-timing her with a Chinese harlot much younger\
  \ than herself. Despite her being twice my age, she was vibrant and playful in equal\
  \ measure. \"You can't quit shining every time your light source attracts a moth.\"\
  \ I confessed. She softened and I could tell Helen was moved by the words I spoke.\
  \ After downing a couple glasses of Merlot and laughing until we had seemingly irritated\
  \ every dozy passenger nearby, she invited me to stay with her once we landed.\n\
  \nIn the front seat was Helen's good friend, Muriel, a fire cracker in the flesh.\
  \ They spoke in their native language as we wound through the city, leaving me alone\
  \ with my thoughts. Though, the last thing I felt was alone; a sense of value, belonging\
  \ perhaps, but most of all I felt safe.\n\nThe drive from the airport to Muriel's\
  \ home was paradoxical: skyscrapers dazzling enough to strike even the most accomplished\
  \ of architects to the left of me, a pale dystopia pierced with poverty to my right.\
  \ They took me to unforgettably the most brilliant wee house I ever saw.\n\nWithout\
  \ hesitation, I followed Helen and Muriel into the humble oasis sheathed in a vivid\
  \ teal blue and lush plant-life. Lunch was fixed upon our arrival with rice, eggs\
  \ and Tinapa, a native Filipino delicacy made of smoked dried fish, on the menu.\
  \ We huddled around the small oval table to feast and I could sense that I was the\
  \ main attraction\u200A-\u200Athe foreigner. Truth is, we were foreign to each other,\
  \ but that never prevented me from being treated with the utmost respect or reciprocating\
  \ with anything but sheer gratitude.\n\nAfter lunch, I was eager to put the Canon\
  \ Rebel XSi my father had unearthed from the depths of his closet to proper use.\
  \ I wandered the streets of Manila, soaking in the novelty: the racket from rusted\
  \ motorized tricycles, the eeriness of fresh death within the raw meat markets and\
  \ the harsh smell of five-cent cigarettes.\n\nI was a stranger to the Philippines,\
  \ and yet, a traveler is constantly at the edge of knowing and embracing otherness\
  \ until it becomes ordinary\u200A-\u200Aeven if just for an instant. We belong to\
  \ a society entangled in controversies about borders, immigration and cultural assimilation;\
  \ what better way to respond than with hospitality rather than hostility?\n\nPutting\
  \ prejudice aside, I actively accepted the warmth of these women as we saw, spoke\
  \ and engaged in friendship.\n\nI walked past the potted flora and through the narrow\
  \ doorway to find Helen sprawled out on the sofa \"Hey stranger\u2026\" I grinned\
  \ \"Welcome back home!\" she answered cheerfully. To this day, I'm not sure if she\
  \ had grasped my allusion, but her response was complete in ever sense of the word.\n\
  \nI sat down next to her and settled into the perplexity of how quickly a home can\
  \ be crafted from unfamiliarity, wishing I had more time to tarry in this newfound\
  \ haven a little while longer."
