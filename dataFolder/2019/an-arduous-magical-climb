Text: "It is still dark outside. I tie up my trekking shoes. I look up at my girlfriend\
  \ while she closes her jacket. Despite being on a tropical island it will be cold\
  \ on the top of Mountain Batur at 1,717 meters, where we are heading. My girlfriend\
  \ convinced me to climb it at early morning in order to reach the top at sunrise.\
  \ I firstly gently refused as my unsporty skills are well famous. Nevertheless,\
  \ her instance convinced me to finally accept and try this new adventure. \nWe are\
  \ now standing on the sidewalk in the main street of the small village of Ubud,\
  \ Bali, waiting for the shuttle that will takes us there. It is 2 AM and there is\
  \ no further sign of life around us.\nFinally, the light bulbs of the van appear\
  \ form the end of the street. We get in. In the cabin there are more sleepy tourists\
  \ all dressed in trekking outfit. The driver tells us to sit down and leaves. The\
  \ journey that will lead us to the bottom of the mountain lasts two hours. We reach\
  \ our destination at 4 AM. It is still dark all around. The area starts filling\
  \ with more vans and tourists. The guides who were already there approach us. They\
  \ divide us into small groups and provide us with a flashlight and breakfast. Someone\
  \ shouts in the dark and everyone starts moving towards the mountain.\nAt first,\
  \ the venture is not hard. We walk through the woods. The flashlights are on and\
  \ enlighten our path, which is not as hard as I first imagined. I thought that too\
  \ soon. \nAfter one hour of walking, we finally reach the midpoint of our journey.\
  \ We stop for some minutes, I lift my head towards the top of the mountain. I see\
  \ a long lighting snake slowly ascending towards the top of the mountain. Our final\
  \ goal is still far to be reached.\nWe move forward. It is from that point that\
  \ the troubles begin. The mountain gets always steeper and steeper. My well-known\
  \ unsporty skills finally come out. The road is arduous now and plod out. To proceed\
  \ I start using my hand. The last half an hour is merciless for someone who is not\
  \ used to this kind of activities. Despite the fresh air I start sweating. The path\
  \ is sleeper and I nearly fall on my face before an arm shoots out and pulls me\
  \ upright. \u201CThank you\u201D I mumble to our guide, who has spent the last part\
  \ of the journey preventing me from breaking various limbs. \nIn the meantime, the\
  \ first sun lights start illuminating the side of mountain. The use of the light\
  \ is no longer necessary now and I can rely on all my four limbs in the climbing.\
  \ I hobble on the mountain. Finally, I see the end. The first people are already\
  \ on the top of the mountain. \u201CI made it\u201D I think joyfully when my feet\
  \ finally reach the destination. I have managed to climb a mountain for the first\
  \ time in my life. The scenario that appears in front of our eyes is astonishing.\
  \ I do not longer feel the pain of the last hour. The sun is rising beyond the Vulcano\
  \ now. The sky turns from black to inky blue to pink and orange. With the light,\
  \ we can see how far we have climbed. I seat on a stone besides my girlfriend and\
  \ we consume our breakfast. I admire the expanse of the valley that stretches before\
  \ me. In distance I can see the outline of the island of Lombok and across the valley\
  \ an even higher volcano: Gunung Agung. \nA couple of monkeys peep out from behind\
  \ the rocks. The most adventures ones approach the tourists and do successful attempts\
  \ in stealing leftovers of our breakfast. \nThe sun keeps on doing his daily job.\
  \ A sun light warms my face. I take an instant to enjoy the moment. Then the guides\
  \ start calling us. It is time to head back."
