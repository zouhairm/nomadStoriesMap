Text: "I woke up to the sun rising under an unfamiliar, misty sky as the value-for-money\
  \ bus I was in, steadily made its way through the depths of Umthata. I groggily\
  \ peaked through the window, watching as the landscapes I knew so well, changed\
  \ before my eyes. The minute I noticed the dusty tin shacks along the road had turned\
  \ into thatch-roofed rondavels, I realised I was a long way from home. I checked\
  \ the time to find that I was hours away from the sleepy town of Makhana and no\
  \ one knew where I was. This was living. \n\nA bolt of energy shot through me as\
  \ the bus pulled into Durban station. I was immediately greeted by a subtle yet\
  \ shocking difference in language, culture and routine as I disembarked. The complicated\
  \ clicks of the isiXhosa language had slipped away and was replaced with a sterner,\
  \ less playful tone. I was officially in the Zulu Kingdom. More importantly, I had\
  \ finally breached the distance between myself and a good friend, Jay, who called\
  \ this province home. Finally reunited after a long year of precarious planning,\
  \ we eagerly set up an itinerary of places we needed to see. \"I feel like a tourist\
  \ in my own home,\" he remarked, noticing that after spending his entire life in\
  \ KwaZulu-Natal, he had never actually ventured beyond the confines of the known.\
  \ \n\nWide awake and eager to explore the lands of the great Shaka Zulu and King\
  \ Cetshwayo, we decided not to waste a single second and ventured to my most desired\
  \ destination - the beach. The North Coast is an entirely different place to the\
  \ rest of KZN. It's an affluent area with billion rand houses, resorts and a lifestyle\
  \ many locals would dare even aspire to. Nevertheless, we made our way down to Ballito\
  \ to frolic in the Indian Ocean which enthusiastically crashed against the rocky\
  \ shoreline. The water was warm and the sand was soft and hot. We hiked from Ballito\
  \ to Salt Rock, climbing the impressive rocks and stopping every now and again to\
  \ marvel at the majestic view. The walk was tiring but well worth the effort. Every\
  \ now and again we would stumble across the beach to take a dip in a tidal pool.\
  \ Donning a snorkel for the first time, I plunged deep into the water with my asthmatic\
  \ lungs, giddily watching the wide variety of colourful fish and sea creatures dance\
  \ around me, nonchalant about my presence. \n\nAfter a day exploring the sand and\
  \ seas, we decided our next journey would be through the hills of the Midlands,\
  \ where so many stories of bloodshed and victory were born. The Valley of 1000 Hills\
  \ felt like being transported into a mystical world unspoiled by civilization. The\
  \ flora and fauna of the region is so distinct to other parts of the country and\
  \ reminded me about how rich and unique the South African climate really is. Staring\
  \ into the depths of the valleys sent chills down my spine. I simultaneously felt\
  \ larger than life and timidly small. As I stood on the edge of a hill overlooking\
  \ nothing but trees and the depths of the valley, I ruminated about the journey\
  \ I took to get there, the risks I made and the giant leap of faith. Suddenly everything\
  \ about life seemed to make sense. \n\nAt that moment, the province became a symbol\
  \ for of South Africa. It is a place of hope, where the unexpected can happen at\
  \ any moment. It is a world of untapped potential and untouched beauty. It is a\
  \ place where you must take risks as the journey is not always safe and the roads\
  \ are not always perfectly paved. I had ignored the wishes of everyone I knew and\
  \ made my way to that exact spot. As the wind blew uncontrollably around me, I realised\
  \ that this was the point of no return. There was so much more to explore - of KwaZulu-Natal,\
  \ South Africa and of the world.  As Jay placed his arms around me, I no longer\
  \ felt as though the strong wind would send me flying into the green abyss. For\
  \ a fleeting moment, all was still and I was home."
