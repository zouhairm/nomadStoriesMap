Text: "I did not want to be in this pub. It had already been a long day, filled with\
  \ longing and lost love, but my friends coaxed me out of my hotel room and onto\
  \ their self-proclaimed pub crawl. While I was not entirely in the mood for this\
  \ pub party, I figured it would be better than the pity party I was currently throwing\
  \ myself. The pub my friends picked wasn't anything special, a dark and wood lined\
  \ bar, typical for London, but it had all the rough spirits and never-ending libations\
  \ that I desperately needed. My friends and I spent the evening drinking and reminiscing\
  \ about the trip, life, and our new year's resolutions. Sick of the typical resolutions\
  \ of \"reading more\" and \"exercising,\" I declared to my friends that I was going\
  \ to say \"yes\" to whatever came my way in 2019, no matter how crazy. I was tired\
  \ of being so safe in life. Eager something new in life including wild rides and\
  \ adventure, I coined 2019 as \"the year of yes.\" This resolution may have been\
  \ the inspiration of liquid courage, but I was determined to stick to it and follow\
  \ through. After my declaration, and a few pints, I was already in a better mood\
  \ and offered to grab the next round. \n\nAs I strolled over to the bar, a classically\
  \ handsome guy caught my eye. He was leaning on the bar, chatting with anyone and\
  \ everyone; his energy intoxicating. He was cute, built like an ex-rugby player,\
  \ with dark hair and a smile that I won't soon forget. As I got closer, I could\
  \ hear him chatting up this couple, introducing himself as James. Just as I reached\
  \ the bar to order a round for my friends, James turned, gestured to me, and said,\
  \ \"and this is my wife.\" Internally flabbergasted, I tried not to give away confusion\
  \ and shock on my face. This strange, but adorable man, was introducing me as his\
  \ wife? I had just declared 2019 as the year of yes and I felt like the universe\
  \ was testing me. I figured there was no time like the present so I turned to James\
  \ and the couple and affirmed, \"I'm James's wife, Jaclyn.\" Those four little words\
  \ kick-started the year of yes, and took me on one of the most spontaneous and memorable\
  \ nights of my life.  \n\nI was no longer Jaclyn, the single American girl enjoying\
  \ her last night out in London with her friends. I was now Jaclyn, the newly-married\
  \ woman enjoying a night out on the town with her British husband James. It was\
  \ quite a fib to step into and I was curious to see if I could pull out all the\
  \ stops and keep up the fa\xE7ade. James and I continued talking with that couple\
  \ who bought us drink after drink to celebrate our recent wedding. Slowly, more\
  \ and more patrons started to hear of our spontaneous nuptials and asked us all\
  \ about our loving relationship. Not missing a beat, James and I started doling\
  \ out relationship advice, wedding advice, and honeymoon advice. \n\nMy friends\
  \ noticing neither the drinks nor I had made it back to our table came searching\
  \ for me. Knowing of my year of yes commitment, they went along with the whole charade.\
  \ One friend even made sure we had our first wedding dance at the pub. She cleared\
  \ the dance floor, had the DJ play \"Thinking Out Loud\" by Ed Sheeran and loudly\
  \ announced that we were newly-weds. \n\nEventually, the night started to dwindle\
  \ down. James and I left the pub together knowing that our hoax had come to an end,\
  \ but that it would be a memory we would share. I never saw James again. I knew\
  \ nothing about him other than his first name. I never even learned our last name.\
  \ But honestly, that is what makes this memory so great. I learned to live outside\
  \ of my comfort zone. I learned to say yes to weird and crazy opportunities because\
  \ you never know what might happen. You just might walk into a pub looking for a\
  \ pint and instead leave with a husband."
