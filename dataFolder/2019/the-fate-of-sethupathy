Text: "\u201CIt was a tsunami. We know what it looks like. We\u2019ve seen one before\u201D\
  , Mani says confidently, referring to the cyclone that wreaked havoc along the Indian\
  \ coast a couple of months ago.\n\n\"It could made a good headline\", I thought\
  \ to myself.\n \nHe then stretches his arm wide and points- \u201CWe found boats\
  \ thrown into farms a mile and a half away from the sea.\u201D\n\nLying in the turquoise\
  \ waters of Bay of Bengal, roughly at the center of the Coromandel Coast, Vellapallam\
  \ is a remote fisherman hamlet. It is largely unknown. It made national headlines\
  \ once as a victim of the Indian Ocean tsunami but eventually faded into oblivion.\
  \ Fortunately, while I was a few miles away from it and vulnerable to misdirection,\
  \ I met a resident who volunteered to lead me to the village. I memorized his instructions-\
  \ a left at Tamil Nadu Wines on the Velankani-Vedaranyam highway and a right at\
  \ the cyclone safety hall. Three miles into this route, a bent and rusty board welcomes\
  \ you to Vellapallam.\n \nIt has been four hours since Mani started showing me around\
  \ the village, and the blazing noon sun starts to overpower my once thick SPF 40\
  \ sunscreen armor. I eye Mani\u2019s stole and consider shamelessly asking for it\
  \ as he seems completely at ease. As I nearly embarrass myself, his 9-year-old son,\
  \ Aaru, interrupts. He came looking for us with the happiest news I could have hoped\
  \ for- \u201CAmma said lunch is ready.\u201D  \n  \nThe privilege of being a guest\
  \ meant I got more gulab jamuns: deep fried cream-flour balls soaked in sugar water.\
  \ These doppelgangers of sapotas are a go-to dessert on auspicious occasions in\
  \ India, and I feel honored. Aaru is visibly salty about this outright discrimination,\
  \ but his mother\u2019s intimidating wide-eyed gaze is enough to shut his protest.\
  \ I slip one of my jamuns onto his plate when his mother is not looking. He smiles.\
  \ I smile back. We telepathically confirm our virtual agreement of camaraderie.\n\
  \n\u201CAaru keeps asking me constantly when he could go with me to the sea. But\
  \ I don\u2019t want him to take after me, so I am sending him to a boarding school\
  \ in Coimbatore soon. My nephew who studied there now works on computer. Aaru, you\
  \ too will be like Karthik, won\u2019t you?\u201D \n\nMani\u2019s concern reminds\
  \ of my father who put me in a boarding school because I loved playing cricket.\
  \ He was a club cricketer and, despite his flair for the game, could not progress\
  \ any further. He had many complaints about the system. I believe I could have succeeded\
  \ despite these barriers. But I guess now we\u2019ll never know.\n \nAaru nods to\
  \ Mani\u2019s rhetorical question.\n\nBy dusk, Aaru and I am playing with his toy\
  \ boat in a concrete reservoir, the size of a bath tub, in his backyard. He had\
  \ received the boat five years ago for his birthday, but still boxes it up neatly\
  \ after he plays every single time. The boat\u2019s colors have faded overtime,\
  \ probably because of the sea water, but there are no signs of wearing or damage\
  \ due to negligence. He named his boat after his dad\u2019s- Sethupathy. \n\nAaru\
  \ runs his hands haphazardly in the pool of water and demonstrates how to simulate\
  \ a storm in the reserve. While I show great promise at this newly acquired skill,\
  \ he ably steers Sethupathy through the make-believe Odyssean assault; it goes underneath\
  \ the waves, over and through them and effortlessly defies all laws of physics dodging\
  \ my attempts to sabotage his quest. His spirit was invincible. He makes it work\
  \ despite all unfavorable conditions.\n\nA loud baritone from the living room calls\
  \ for Aaru, pausing his flow. We stop recreating the quasi-odyssey and an eerie-silence\
  \ sets the scene.\nMani enters the backyard and asks Aaru to quit playing and go\
  \ study with his sisters. Aaru beseeches for a few more minutes of play-time. Mani\
  \ gives him the intimidating wide-eyed gaze.  \n\nAaru bites his lip. He mumbles,\
  \ heeds, and then retreats.\n\nHe leaves but forgets his boat behind. I sit there\
  \ for a while hoping he will come back to get Sethupathy."
