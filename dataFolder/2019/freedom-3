Text: "The bus was crawling up the narrow trail in the steep valley. The panorama\
  \ was glorious with its spectacular Middle Age cottages and a challenging part of\
  \ the Pyrenees ahead.  Was I hypnotized by the scenery or more by the emotion that\
  \ I was travelling to taste freedom?  We were moving slowly but I supposed that\
  \ was the way freedom to be achieved, patiently.\nAfter a long ride through winding\
  \ paths we reached the final point. It was a stunning, movie-worthy place. I was\
  \ facing a Spanish rural medieval village with elegant cottages and magnificent\
  \ mountains view. What a breath-taking start of the freedom experience! Hundreds\
  \ of people have gathered at a beautiful remote location to celebrate another way\
  \ of working and living. \nI was welcomed with warm hugs from people I was seeing\
  \ for the first time. Most conversations started with the question \u201CHow do\
  \ you feel about the place?\u2019\u2019. Yes, it lavishly brought me tranquility\
  \ with its green ridges and pure fresh air. Vast bare horizons inspired disconnection\
  \ from the bustle and nurtured the imagination. The organizers of the event had\
  \ chosen the perfect location match to inspire freedom. \nThe room in the cottage\
  \ was charming with its mattresses on the floor and lack of objects.  My Hungarian\
  \ and Brazilian roommates were easy-going and passionate about life. I had never\
  \ thought that it was possible to make an authentic human connection so quickly.\
  \ Mornings were moments of reverence to nature, moments to gaze at the steamy \u201C\
  cordilleras\u201D and reach emotional detox. Yoga and meditation classes were organized\
  \ at sunrise. Cosy open spaces were formed in front of the cottages in order to\
  \ host meals and to create networking atmosphere. \nThe days were abundant in workshops\
  \ with digital nomads, entrepreneurs, journalists, filmmakers and creatives from\
  \ all walks of life. People who had already took on the path of freedom were sharing\
  \ stories how they had discovered their true meaning. Most of them were nomads and\
  \ pioneers of the location-independent lifestyle. They were globetrotters devoted\
  \ to make positive changes and to inspire others to find their real selves. I heard\
  \ delightful stories for preserving cultural heritage in Nepal, transforming the\
  \ labor markets by disrupting the traditional recruitment approaches, helping children\
  \ in Uganda through jewelry production. We listened, shared, literally counted the\
  \ stars at night and were spiritually guided by a shaman-alchemist. And, of course\
  \ ate paella. \nI embarked on that event to share a new born idea, my sense of purpose.\
  \ I was a pure beginner at searching it. Here my self-awareness was opened. I realized\
  \ freedom is to live in alignment with your beliefs and values. Freedom is also\
  \ gratefulness and awe to beauty. \nThere were several contemplating moments during\
  \ this one week when I felt enormously grateful for meeting such an enlightening\
  \ community.  It was that quiet emotion of belonging to where I had always imagined\
  \ being. The timeless beauty of Spanish Pyrenees was powerfully giving the message\
  \ of following my inner expression."
