Text: "Usually when I travel, I have a local guide by way of a family member or friend\
  \ abroad. Travelling this way allows me to go off the beaten path a bit and see\
  \ places that tourists generally overlook. I can have a homecooked meal, meet natives,\
  \ and skip the traps while living like a local. However, for the first time in my\
  \ life, I was travelling without knowing so much as one face in the country. I simply\
  \ hoped I\u2019d meet someone along the way who could help me find the \u201Clocal\u201D\
  \ activities. \n\nOne tourist trap I was keen on seeing was Amoudi Bay, though many\
  \ contributors on online forums were divided about whether it was a worthy trek,\
  \ especially considering it required a hike along a rocky path that\u2019s barely\
  \ even a trail. If only I could find my way down. After eating two gyro in the blazing\
  \ sun, I set out to find the path that would ultimately lead to me where I could\
  \ cliff jump. The signs made no sense to me and I couldn\u2019t quite navigate where\
  \ I was trying to go. I walked downhill, unsure of the path I was on, when I decided\
  \ it was best to retreat and try reading the signs again.\n\nI learned that reading\
  \ Greek signs twice doesn\u2019t actually help if you can\u2019t read Greek. Fortunately,\
  \ I spotted some cars sitting in a parking lot. I decided to stake out the place\
  \ for people I could ask for directions. As each person walked past, I would ask\
  \ them if they could direct me to Amoudi Bay. Often too busy or without a grasp\
  \ of English, I was left to continually interrupt people on their daily errands.\
  \ Finally, a lovely couple with a dog took pity on me and invited me to their car.\
  \ \n\nI had visions of the movie \u201CTaken\u201D flashing in my head as I got\
  \ in their car. They seemed nice enough, but my aunt had specifically warned me\
  \ when I arrived in Santorini to not end up like the film. I decided to push my\
  \ fears away and focus on how kind they were to offer to drive me as far as they\
  \ could go. As we started to drive, I promised myself I would never tell my mom.\
  \ To alleviate my stress, I asked them about their life in Santorini. When did they\
  \ come? Where are they from originally? I have always been drawn to people\u2019\
  s stories. I love to get deep, learn how they ended up in this place, but also get\
  \ restaurant recommendations. Fortunately, they gave me all I wanted and more. They\
  \ were newly married and moved here for the easy living. They loved going to Lucky\u2019\
  s Souvlaki, though they conceded it was definitely touristy in the busier months\
  \ (I checked out this restaurant later and made great friends with the owner, even\
  \ scoring a delicious and free Greek salad). When we got to the edge of the rocky\
  \ path, they gave me directions to the Bay, their contact information should I find\
  \ myself in trouble on the island and (thank God) let me out of their car. \n\n\
  Though I had travelled before and travelled since then, I cite that hot, sticky\
  \ day in Oia as the best I\u2019ve had abroad. While the prospect of getting in\
  \ a car of (or even just trusting) people you don\u2019t know is daunting and can\
  \ be downright scary, ultimately you learn about the innate goodness of people and\
  \ the similarities in our stories. Not knowing if the Greek couple would drive me\
  \ to the right place, not being certain of how to get back, not having a phone if\
  \ things went wrong, and not knowing if the water was deep enough to dive into,\
  \ I jumped feet first from a cliff into the (surprisingly warm for April) Aegean\
  \ Sea. The unknown is scary and uncomfortable; having a friendly face on an island\
  \ where you know nobody not only provides a sense of security, but it provides a\
  \ sense of belonging. I felt so welcome, like I am not just passing through, but\
  \ I have made a connection to the community I was fortunate to visit."
