Text: "When I arrived in Curanilahue, the first thing I noticed was the fog and the\
  \ pines. We exited the highway and the tiny valley lay before us - a blur of brown,\
  \ green, and rusted earth, flanked on one side by a river, the hills lush with pine\
  \ and eucalyptus trees. I was immediately reminded of the dense forests of the Pacific\
  \ Northwest, where I\u2019d most recently lived and left to embark on this journey\
  \ into the unknown. I\u2019d only find out later that these trees, that seemed so\
  \ quintessentially Chilean to the outsider or novice eye, were not endemic, but\
  \ crucial to the forestry industry that both sustained the region economically and\
  \ threatened the viability of native plant species by usurping the water supply.\
  \ To locals who remember Curanilahue\u2019s origins as a haphazard coal mining town\
  \ and its native landscape, the changing scenery is lamentable. \n\nDuring my time\
  \ in this small pueblo, nearly six hundred kilometers south of Santiago, the locals\
  \ always asked me, \u201CWhy would you ever come here?\u201D Perhaps the most diplomatic\
  \ answer would be to say that, as a volunteer in a Chilean government program, I\
  \ had been randomly assigned to a community the government determined needed extra\
  \ English language teaching support. The deeper, more compelling truth was that\
  \ I had found myself starring in a rudderless life chapter that begged for a drastic\
  \ change. In the end, my friend and fellow teacher wisely referred to the Programa\
  \ Ingl\xE9s Abre Puertas (English Opens Doors Program) as Programa Abre Mi Puerta\
  \ (Open My Door Program), in honor of the unexpected lifeline it gave me. \n\nWhile\
  \ my memories of these years feel like looking at photographs through an old view-finder,\
  \ the phrase that accompanies my recollections is \u201CTe acompa\xF1o.\u201D I\
  \ will accompany you. If I needed to go to the pharmacy? Te acompa\xF1o. To buy\
  \ fresh bread or go to the grocery store? Te acompa\xF1o. To visit the doctor? Te\
  \ acompa\xF1o. To stand in line at the visa office for three hours? Te acompa\xF1\
  o. To wait for a regional bus that will arrive at an undetermined hour? Te acompa\xF1\
  o. To wash my dishes or clean my floor? Te acompa\xF1o. Initially, I found these\
  \ offers surprising and kind, later suffocating, but eventually I learned my lesson:\
  \ Mundane tasks can be imbued with meaning, especially if shared. No plans are needed.\
  \ \n\nMost of my evenings after school were filled with \u201CTe invito a mi casa\u201D\
  \ to share in a traditional \"once,\" an evening meal reminiscent of English afternoon\
  \ tea. Humble wooden tables are elegantly transformed with immaculate flowery tablecloths,\
  \ placemats, and individual serving dishes for each accompaniment - jams, butter,\
  \ mashed avocado, p\xE2t\xE9, and sliced packaged cheese or \"quesillo.\" All of\
  \ these spreadables are enjoyed with the beloved \"pan amasado\" and washed down\
  \ with a blistering cup of black tea or instant coffee. While I found it difficult\
  \ to stomach this fare nightly, longing for produce, the daily indigestion I suffered\
  \ was \"vale la pena\" for these moments of togetherness. \n\nThe reminder was essential\
  \ and timely. In my Western world, where at any given time I can scroll a dozen\
  \ different articles about our increasing mental isolation and emotional estrangement,\
  \ I wonder how we can transform our rituals of connection to relish these small\
  \ moments. What is the balance between independence and interdependence? This dialectical\
  \ tension is persistent: My admiration of the Chilean ability to make a celebration\
  \ out of anything is profound, but not absolute. When I find myself at a baptism\
  \ party that\u2019s still raging at 3 a.m. and decide to leave, I am both amused\
  \ and frustrated to be told, \u201CNo! No te puedes ir ahora, todav\xEDa tenemos\
  \ que servir la torta!\u201D I love eating cake and dancing cumbia just as much\
  \ as the next gal, but don\u2019t enjoy being held captive until the \"madrugada\"\
  \ against my will. But after forty-five more minutes pass and the cake has yet to\
  \ be cut, I realize I have two choices when asked to dance again, and this time\
  \ I choose, \"Te acompa\xF1o.\""
