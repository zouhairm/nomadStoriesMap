Text: I still remember the first trip to the beach that I took with my close friends.
  Two years ago, my friends and I went to Jumeriah Beach to rest and enjoy our vacation
  together. We had been planning this trip for two weeks. During these two weeks we
  made hotel reservations and bought food and beverages for the trip. Finally, one
  Friday we left at 6 a.m. to Ras Al Khaimah and arrived around 10 a.m.. As soon as
  we arrived to the hotel, we started to drink at the bar in the swimming pool. A
  few hours later we were drunk, so we decided to go to the beach. We played a funny
  soccer game to down the level of alcohol in our blood. It was a funny experience
  because nobody was able to kick the ball and almost everybody was sick. After the
  game, we watched the sunset together, and we told stories about our lives and shared
  our points of view about the future. Then we returned to the hotel, and we ate some
  snacks. Moreover, we drink another beers and swam in the pool until it got late.
  Around 12 p.m. we decided to play some games where the loser had to take some shots.
  A lot of times, I was the loser and therefore I did not remember what else happened
  during that crazy night. The next morning we took a bicycle ride to some close beaches.
  I remember vividly the ride to Marjan Beach since it was so pretty. For that reason,
  we decided to stayed there the rest of the day and enjoy the breathtaking views
  of this paradise beach. After this exhausting trip to Ritz Carlton Hamra Beach ,
  we returned to our hotel. The next day, very early, we returned to Abu Dhabi. That
  was my first and unforgettable trip with my friends.
