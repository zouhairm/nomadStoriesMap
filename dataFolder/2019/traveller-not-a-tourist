Text: My first destination of Europe trip was Italy.  A twelve day trip in INR 65000
  with local flavors. An incredibly great experience of staying with locals (same
  agers,  couples,  families, old agers) , exploring unexplored places,  eating  at
  a locally popular place, commuting through public buses,  biking,  visiting city
  center at midnight, trying farm fresh wine for free, cooking for the locals and
  tasting their home delicacies.  An experience far better than  booking through a
  tour operator. As Italy is well known for its architecture and history,  I took
  free walking tours in Venice and Rome to breathe their culture. They are excellently
  arranged and worth experiencing. Moreover, considering   food,  Pizzas, Pastas and
  other Italian dishes are popular but there are many other local dishes equally lip
  smacking.  Dare you miss them!  Local friends play a major role in it. For me,  Couch
  surfing - home stay option turned a blessing in disguise.  It's a free stay concept
  for people interested in culture exchange.  Meeting people with experience of traveling
  to more than 40 countries was more than wow. The trip was a great medium of learning
  and was an enriching experience.
