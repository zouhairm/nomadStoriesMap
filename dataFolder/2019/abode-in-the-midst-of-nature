Text: "Monsoon and road trip compliment each other really well. It gets even better\
  \ when you decide to explore the natural beauty hidden behind the hustle and bustle\
  \ of cities. The anxiety of finding a hidden gem at the end of the travel , makes\
  \ the journey exciting.\n\nEveryone is looking to explore new roads, new destinations,\
  \ new resorts, and all this to get away from the regular work and to enjoy the time\
  \ with family and friends.\n\nThe search for such a new experience ended with finding\
  \ a resort named Kondan The Retreat.\n\nThe drive from Mumbai to the resort is picturesque.\
  \ Once you cross Lonavala and exit the express way then you have to drive through\
  \ NH48 highway for approx 2 hours. There are some patches of road near Kanhe which\
  \ will help you digest all that you have eaten. But when you are planning to visit\
  \ the interiors then you need to be prepared accordingly. The greenery on either\
  \ side of the road will nullify the trouble taken to wade through the potholes.\n\
  \nThe scenic beauty gets better and better as you keep driving towards the destination.\
  \ The road less taken will always have something special in store for you. Similarly\
  \ the drive spanning 30 kms through a small road carved across the nature\u2019\
  s green blanket makes the drive interesting. The steep roads with the effect of\
  \ rains make them look like waterfalls. So your heart will skip a beat when you\
  \ actually get a glimpse of a natural waterfall flowing straight from the sky (as\
  \ the fog covers the origin of the waterfall). I was awe stuck with the scenic beauty\
  \ which kept unfolding in front of my eyes after each turn of the road.\n\nKondan\
  \ The Retreat is a resort amidst the nature. The name \u2018Kondan\u2019 in Marathi\
  \ language means a gem carved from stone. The place is majorly built from the stones\
  \ excavated while creating the space for the resort. It is situated at Malegaon\
  \ and right adjacent to a valley. It is a small resort with just 10 rooms. The first\
  \ thing that you notice when you enter Kondan is the rustic charm of the resort.\n\
  \nThe brain behind this gem is Prashant Padwal. The Melbourne educated Talegoan\
  \ based Prashant quit his corporate job in Australia and came back to India to build\
  \ his dad\u2019s dream project. He has patiently built this place with utmost care.\
  \ It took him 6.5 years to construct the resort and another 3 years to get the infrastructure,\
  \ road , etc ready. So 10 years of patience and perseverance has helped him and\
  \ his family to present Kondan to the customers. The resort has already starting\
  \ getting lot of accolades and has won an international award for being one of the\
  \ best \u2018Green Resort\u2019.\n\nThe rooms are the highlight of Kondan. The moment\
  \ you get inside the Tarangan category room (which is suitable for a couple or a\
  \ family of 3) , I am sure you will walk past the room and enter the balcony. Unique\
  \ styled balcony facing the valley has an antique style cloth chair and a hammock\
  \ which is in built to the floor of the balcony. The room itself, as part of the\
  \ cantilever structure, is protruding towards the valley , so when you lie on the\
  \ hammock it is like lying in the nature\u2019s lap. The flooring of the balcony\
  \ is covered with artificial turf to make you feel that you are part of the green\
  \ nature outside.\nThe whole place will give the nostalgic feeling of childhood\
  \ or younger days spent at your ancestral house. Lot of detailing has gone behind\
  \ the designing of the room, interiors, accessories, etc. Even the cloth hangers\
  \ are made of bamboo and you will find a small layer of marble pebbles attached\
  \ to the floor at the entrance of the room. \n\nKondan The Retreat is truly an Abode\
  \ in the midst of nature. A great place to visit if you like to enjoy the nature\
  \ and its surroundings. If you are lucky then you can spot peacocks in the valley.\
  \ The infinity pool adds to the beauty of this place."
