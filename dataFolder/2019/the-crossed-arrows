Text: "Native Americans, indigenous people with a deeply-rooted culture, depicted\
  \ everything they knew with a symbol. But the one that caught my eye, was their\
  \ symbol for friendship: Two arrows crossing paths.\nWhen you come from a land as\
  \ diverse as India, you are naturally inclined to confine yourself within the comfort\
  \ and familiarity of your own linguistic group. But have you ever wondered what\
  \ would happen if you were to wander outside the familiar into the unfamiliar?\n\
  I met Tanvi Mate on a trip to the Himalayan Mountains seven years ago. What started\
  \ out as a simple greeting every time we crossed each other\u2019s paths, quickly\
  \ grew into knowing about each other\u2019s entire day. Soon, we were sharing stories\
  \ of our past, drawing parallels between the two lives lived out in our separate\
  \ worlds. Never once did it occur to me that I was divulging my deepest secrets\
  \ to someone who was a total stranger to me just three days ago.\nShe had become\
  \ my friend. One that I thought I would never see again. She would return to Pune,\
  \ and I to Goa, 273.5 miles keeping us apart. We kept in touch with phone calls\
  \ each night but inevitably, that too took its natural course, dwindling down to\
  \ an occasional text every other week. Our crossed arrows were diverging again.\n\
  Two years later, I was old enough to travel wherever I pleased. Without a second\
  \ thought, I bought a bus ticket for Pune. I was nervous about seeing Tanvi again.\
  \ Had she changed? Maybe she didn\u2019t care to see me now. Would we able to pick\
  \ up where we left off? I told her about my plan to visit her and she sounded delighted.\
  \ \nTwelve-hour journeys by bus along a windy road are not everyone\u2019s cup of\
  \ tea but when I finally arrived, the look of excitement on Tanvi\u2019s face and\
  \ the warmth of her hug assured me that it was worth it.\nGoa is a small state on\
  \ the western coast of India. Public modes of transport are few and far between.\
  \ Most households have their own vehicle to get around, as did I. Pune is a crowded\
  \ metropolitan city, greatly dependent on public transport. We stuffed ourselves\
  \ and my luggage into a tiny rickshaw (also known as a tuk-tuk to those in the West).\
  \ Speaking her native \u2018Marathi\u2019, she bargained with the driver to reduce\
  \ the fare and then we were on our way to my hotel.\nThe word \u2018rest\u2019 meant\
  \ nothing to her. \u201CYou did not travel this distance to rest!\u201D, she said\
  \ to me. I was too worn out by the journey to argue. Even if I had the stamina for\
  \ it, at that moment, her cute voice and the look of excitement on her face would\
  \ have surely discouraged me. Our first stop was for breakfast at a South Indian\
  \ restaurant called Vaishali which means \u2018the great\u2019 in Marathi.  \nWe\
  \ walked along the streets of the city, burning a hole in my pocket purchasing clothes\
  \ and stuffing myself with the local fares. Tanvi would scold me each time I tried\
  \ to buy a shirt in a high-end retail store, dragging my hind out of it and into\
  \ a local store with similar wares for half the price. I sure was grateful to have\
  \ her around.\nLater that evening, we did as all people our age did, and hit the\
  \ clubs. We danced like there was no tomorrow. I\u2019m usually conscious about\
  \ how I carry myself in public but it was easy to let go and unwind in a city where\
  \ I was unlikely to run into anyone I might know. \nI\u2019d have never thought\
  \ that a small-town boy like me would find his best friend in a girl that lived\
  \ 273.5 miles away from him. I promised Tanvi that I would visit her atleast once\
  \ a year and three years later I can proudly say that I have kept that promise.\
  \ \nThe native Americans had a society with a deep culture. Somehow, what they believed\
  \ in, defined my life. I would have never expected to find a friend, so far from\
  \ home. Like two arrows crossing each other\u2019s path."
