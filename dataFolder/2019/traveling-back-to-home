Text: "It was a warm night in Cyprus... when I ad to  chose a country from the list\
  \ of approval destinations by my university. I had my eyes closed. I couldn't think\
  \ about anything, I wanted just to go far away...so I left my inner feeling to guide\
  \ my finger on the catalogue. I chosen Italy... a little city not so far from Milan.\
  \ I wasn't prepared at all for this 6 months vacation. For first time in my life\
  \ I was traveling alone but I wasn't worrying about anything. I just prepared my\
  \ laggages and I started my joutney to the uknown. I was on that flight when I really\
  \ realised that I never tried to imagine how life could be there. It was more like\
  \ traveling back to home.... no panic, no thoughts, not anxious feelings. How I\
  \ couldn't been curious at least? \n... The first 2 months in Pavia, a little old\
  \ graphical city were too calm to be a stranger in another city. I was alone and\
  \ I wasn't fluent in english... but Icould understood Italian language either I\
  \ couldn't replay back. So weird. Yeah.. After 4 months I understood that I was\
  \ home. Italy it was my home but I couldn't realise that from the start.  Only when\
  \ the time was going to finished I start to felt bad for the returning day. I started\
  \ to worried and feel panic. So Where I have to go now? Here is my home. Here I\
  \ feel like home. I was worrying the nights about this thoughts. My soul belongs\
  \ here I whispered to myself...but all the good things must come to an end. I knew\
  \ it from the start. Returning back to my beautiful island of Cyprus, I knew that\
  \ i left a part of me back. I promise to Duomo in Milan square that I will see the\
  \ moon again at 3 the morning,sitting on the stairs, surrounded with local friends\
  \ I met there, singing in silence, drinking beers and enjoy that August night. I\
  \ promise to Ponte Coperto rever that I will seat again on the grass watching the\
  \ fishermans feeding the birds on the bridge... I promise to my soul that I will\
  \ take me back home again. Now I know. There is not distance between me and my soul.\
  \  Because the World is my home. Earth my house. Travel is my happiness . Writing\
  \ is my  passion. Learning is my addiction. Meeting new people around the worl is\
  \ my purpose. \nLive, love, learn, travel, share, grow \U0001F64F\U0001F9E1"
