Text: "Motorbikes whirred past, honking their horns for no good reason. Tropical heat\
  \ produced sweat that dripped down the sides of my body and tickled my hips. An\
  \ old Camry swerved down the narrow soi, what the locals call a street, that was\
  \ lined with potted plants and cigarette butts. A lanky Thai man rolled down the\
  \ window and smiled through relaxed eyes. That was our cue to pile in. Six farangs,\
  \ a blisteringly humid Thai night, and two almost finished bottles of whiskey.\n\
  \nI sat on the lap of the alcoholic British man I thought I was falling in love\
  \ with. I purposely wiggled a bit getting situated, next to the ex-marine from California\
  \ and the tiny, shitfaced Filipino man. A Thai woman sat on the lap of the man next\
  \ to me and I remember the way she flung her hair into my mouth trying to get situated.\
  \ I remember how much it angered me and how much I couldn\u2019t make sense of why.\
  \ We piled in, unsure of where we were headed, just happy to be going. The smell\
  \ of sweat, cigarettes, whiskey and aching hearts all searching for a solution to\
  \ the pain the universe had so graciously presented to us in this tropical Neverland.\n\
  \nIt was there, packed into the back of a rickety old car somewhere on the outskirts\
  \ of Bangkok, sweating with the electric heat, that I really felt the freedom of\
  \ an unchained life for the first time. Every decision that had led me to this exact\
  \ situation was made by me and me only. Every step to get to this point was an intentional\
  \ action I had committed to because every part of my being wanted to. This was not\
  \ a result of anybody else\u2019s decision-making or influence in my life. \n\n\
  The driver, the lanky Thai guy, was a policeman. He looked back at me, knowing full\
  \ well what trouble I was in with the British man. He smiled and handed me his whiskey\
  \ in a cup to hold for the ride. I still have no idea what he told me, but he pointed\
  \ between my thighs and I assumed he wanted me to hide it. \u201CFrom who?\u201D\
  \ I remember thinking. \u201CThe police? You\u2019re the police.\u201D Nevertheless,\
  \ I took a sip of lao khao and put the cup of whiskey between my legs, turning back\
  \ to look at the British man to see what he thought of everything. He was half passed\
  \ out and that\u2019s a metaphor for more than a handful of things.\n\nI don\u2019\
  t remember much of the drive, what was said, or where exactly we went, but I remember\
  \ the feeling of the slight breeze against my face as the policeman rolled the window\
  \ down and stuck his hand out to wave at another policeman on a motorbike. I remember\
  \ feeling no fear, no anxiety, no worry. I remember thinking I should feel all of\
  \ these things, but I don\u2019t remember feeling them. I remember the sticky heat,\
  \ the cool air against my red cheeks, and the tingling of the electricity all over\
  \ my body.\n\nWe got to where we were going, I suppose, because we all got out of\
  \ the car. The policeman bought me French fries later and held one up in front of\
  \ my face. I reached for it and he kissed me on the cheek and stuffed it into my\
  \ mouth. It was then, with one French fry and a kiss, that I really learned about\
  \ the law and what governs our hearts when they\u2019re unchained from all of these\
  \ man-made rules. I had finally tasted freedom from the life I was told I was supposed\
  \ to live and it was salty and oh so delicious."
