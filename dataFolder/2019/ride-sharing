Text: "I clutch my bag, trying to make sense of the surroundings. Heavy machinery,\
  \ mounds of soil and the outline of metal pillars - a construction site definitely.\
  \ I hear doors behind me open, people piling into the car but I don't dare looking\
  \ behind. The driver hops into the seat next to me, one hand glued to his ear with\
  \ his phone, while steering the car with the other over the non-existent road. I\
  \ prop my hand against the dashboard to stop myself from bumping onto the windshield,\
  \ instinctively searching for the seat-belt again, despite knowing that there isn't\
  \ one.\n\nIn the process, I steal a glimpse behind. My suspicions are true: all\
  \ my co-passengers are men. As we hit the road meandering the mountains, the photograph\
  \ of the royal family on the dashboard wobbles, our driver Lepcha Dorji dressed\
  \ in gho, the traditional Bhutanese attire is still on his phone. The road is narrow\
  \ with hardly enough space for two vehicles, a little mistake could send the vehicle\
  \ flying down into the ravine but for Lepcha, it is business as usual. \n\nThe sun\
  \ has disappeared somewhere behind the hills with last light lingering in the sky.\
  \ I turn my gaze towards the window, peering into the valley, catching the glint\
  \ of the river meandering below. I turn to Lepcha, to ask him if he knows the name\
  \ of this particular river but my heart jumps into my mouth as I see a car in the\
  \ opposite direction headed straight on to us. I let out a scream just as our car\
  \ goes off the road stopping in time, inches away from edge of the cliff. \n\nThere\
  \ is a collective laughter in the vehicle as I shudder. I hear someone from behind\
  \ asking me in a familiar tongue as to why I was so scared when Lepcha was in charge.\
  \ \n\"My co-passengers are my countrymen after all!\" \nInstead of relief, I feel\
  \ fear seeping up my spine.\n\nManeuvering dangerous bends effortlessly, Lepcha\
  \ goes on to disperse his wisdom. \"Death is inevitable. With no wife or kids, no\
  \ tensions\" he guffaws. I tell him that I have a husband waiting for me. This is\
  \ also aimed at my co-passengers in hopes that the information would work as a shielding\
  \ charm. I check my phone to try to see if I can text my husband who would be stirring\
  \ awake in the US but there's zero connectivity. \n\nI try remembering my local\
  \ friend's words who saw me off at Thimphu. The shared taxis were the quickest way\
  \ to get to Phuentsholing. I would cross the foot border in the night itself, be\
  \ in time for the early morning bus that would take me back, she had told me. \n\
  \"Quickest, yes, but is it the safest?\" \n'She has done this a thousand times and\
  \ probably she knows better', I reassure myself.\n\nWe stop at a make-shift reataurant\
  \ at the edge of the road. Lepcha indicates it is break time. I wait for others\
  \ to disembark first, counting six men. \"Madam, here\", a voice signals, presumably\
  \ my co-passenger's.\n\"Great! As a solo female Indian traveler, I stick out like\
  \ a sore thumb while I can't even place their faces in the dark!\" \nI sip on suja,\
  \ traditional butter tea, served by a rather astonished Bhutanese woman. \n\nWe\
  \ stop again after a while, this time at a checkpost. I try to figure out which\
  \ of the windows to approach, when the familiar voice directs me again. In the tungsten\
  \ light, I face their backs. Dressed in tattered clothes, I hear them tell the officer\
  \ they are a group of daily laborers, hailing from Bengali village, crossing the\
  \ border every week for work. \nMeanwhile, my permit is stamped with no questions.\
  \ \n\nI step back into the vehicle, ashamed at the classist rhetoric of viewing\
  \ them as predators, saddened by the fact that I had to be on my guard nonetheless.\
  \ As we descend the last set of hills, the mounting moon spills blue ink all around,\
  \ I let the calm envolop me, hoping for a day when I needn't have to pack my fear\
  \ in my backpack on every solo trip I took on as a woman."
