Text: "Oh, traveling alone? I surely can assure you that it was not scary but most\
  \ people said that it is. My friends told me, traveling alone was never in their\
  \ minds or their to-do list because it would make them look \u2018friendless\u2019\
  \ and lonely. Somehow they were right, being alone will make you look like you have\
  \ no friends to hang out with. However, by traveling alone, darling you will never\
  \ get lost, at least you have more than you ever need which is yourself.\n\tI made\
  \ myself a me time everytime i travel alone. This time, i was going to the busiest\
  \ city with all the gleaming and glimmering lights, Jakarta the capital of Indonesia.\
  \ As the hours passed by sitting in an intercity train that takes 12 hours from\
  \ Surabaya to Jakarta, thought i was going to die because of boredom but a man who\
  \ sat beside me suddenly talked to me that he took the train just in hope he\u2019\
  s not late before it\u2019s too late. His mother was dying and to ease the pain\
  \ and worry he needed someone to talk to. From that time, i wonder what would happened\
  \ if i had a friend with me and i was busy talking to him/her, maybe he wouldn\u2019\
  t have someone to talk to.\n\tMinutes before i got up to leave for my stop which\
  \ was the second most busiest train station in town, Pasar Senen station, he thanked\
  \ me. His face showed gratefulness that i thought i did not deserve, all i did was\
  \ just listening to him but i thanked him back and got up. The next hour was spent\
  \ in the roar of this city, the crowded streets, cars, motorcycles and Bajaj the\
  \ three wheeled traditional vehicles. Once i wonder, how do people survive to keep\
  \ on living in this city? Then i was silenced while standing in a commuter line\
  \ watching people with their phones and the dense landscapes of Jakarta. I walked\
  \ out when the speaker said the train had arrived in a Sudirman station and the\
  \ dry breeze of air struck my body, the answer came into mind. It\u2019s that they\
  \ don\u2019t have any better choice than keeping their grip, staying afloat from\
  \ the demands of being in a city that never sleeps.\n\tI walked some more steps\
  \ away from the station to meet a driver that i booked via an app which enables\
  \ me to know the driver\u2019s name, the plate number and the fare that i have to\
  \ pay. This kind of transportation is quite popular in Indonesia for its affordable\
  \ prices. I do not wonder why this kind of transportation is most favoured by Indonesians\
  \ because it surely is way cheaper than taxi.\n\tThe driver asked me where i come\
  \ from and he was a bit not shocked. He said Jakarta is not all Betawi people (Betawi\
  \ is the tribe of citizens whose family is originally born in Jakarta, we can distingush\
  \ them by the language they speak). Many people came from small cities to try and\
  \ dare to hope that their fortune would change if they have job in this city. It\
  \ was also the reason why he came to Jakarta. His fortune, he said, did not go well\
  \ as he expected but he was all thankful for the income he received by being a driver.\
  \ At least he can provide enough for his children. From this little conversation,\
  \ i somehow felt like i was in his shoes and absorbing all the gratefulness he unconsciously\
  \ shared.\n\tAt last, i didn\u2019t expect to wander to this city by enjoying the\
  \ places that most of the tourists do but somehow, it is more interesting to feel\
  \ exactly how it feels to be one of the locals and also the fact that the fares\
  \ here are quite expensive compared with Surabaya. As i jumped into my hotel room,\
  \ i thought about all the things occured today. The incredible stories that kept\
  \ me occupied with wisdom from the people that i have never met before. From this\
  \ moment, i was very sure that traveling alone is the best thing for every person\
  \ that has not gotten the time to know themselves better."
