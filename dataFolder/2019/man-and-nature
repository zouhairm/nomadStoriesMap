Text: "My travel story is about a place named Chikmangalur in Karnataka,India.\n\n\
  I love exploring nature and find peace in travelling away from city life, One fine\
  \ day I was planning to take a break for 3 days from my 10 hours everyday Job and\
  \ explore the nature.\n\nImmediately after planning I booked the ticket from redbus\
  \ website to chikmagalur and boarded the very next day, I was little bit scared\
  \ because i don\u2019t understand thier local language as mostly people of Karnataka\
  \ speak kannada but that reason cannot be the one to stop me , While travelling\
  \ in bus i was looking for hotels in Chikmanaglur but a guy next to me who later\
  \ became my very good friend suggested me to have a homestay so I booked a home\
  \ stay which was later turned out to be the best decision of the trip, I called\
  \ the Aunty and asked if there is any accommodation and she replied with lot of\
  \ love and kindness \u2018 ye beta we have\u2019 and she understands english well\
  \ so I booked my accommodation .\n\nOnce i visited the place the aunty welcomed\
  \ me with thier family and introduced me to everyone and i feel very comfortable,\
  \ She took me to the stay and explained about the timing for hot water etc and there\
  \ was frequent power cut issue, after I freshes up they called me for lunch and\
  \ during that they have told me about the places i cam visit and also arranged the\
  \ transportation .\n\nThe very first day I went to a very beautiful water fall and\
  \ to reach there I have do do trekking for almost 4 Km they entire day was spent\
  \ their and after that went back to homestay.\n\nThe very next day i visited to\
  \ mountain peaks and did a lot of mindfullness .\n\nThats is about my 2 days journey,\
  \ Thanks"
