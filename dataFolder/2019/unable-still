Text: "The air is heavy, sweet almost. After waiting in the hallway for a long while,\
  \ St. Teresa's nuns let us in. I try to hide my body's recoiling at the sights,\
  \ sounds, smells.\n\n'Walk around and see where you'd like to help,' they told us.\
  \ 'Then just get started.' I find myself drawn to the sounds of babies' cries and\
  \ am suddenly in a room that is maybe the closest to hell I've ever imagined. Full\
  \ of fear and hesitation, I look back the way I came and see that my group is gone,\
  \ already dispersed into other areas of the building. I am alone.\n\nA tired-looking\
  \ woman hands me a bowl of mush and says something to me in Kreyol that I can only\
  \ assume means 'Feed the babies.' I hesitate, then take the bowl from her, about\
  \ to ask which baby to feed when she turns and is gone. I am alone.\n\nMy senses\
  \ can't take in all the violence fast enough. The room is filled with at least 20\
  \ cribs, crammed every which way. One, sometimes two babies to a crib, and at least\
  \ half are crying. As I make my way around the room confronted with the arduous\
  \ task of deciding which hungry baby gets the food, I finally notice the babies.\
  \ The mattresses have no sheets, just plastic coverings that stick to their tiny\
  \ sweaty bodies. I understand when I spot a few that sit in their own urine. I have\
  \ to look twice to confirm \u2014 yes, those are dark puddles of their own urine.\
  \ At quieter moments I hear the flies, the room full of them. They land on the children's\
  \ faces, arms, bellies \u2014 they do not even flinch. They have become accustomed\
  \ to them.\n\nI begin spooning mush into a ravenous child's mouth. This pause allows\
  \ me to realize with sudden horror that the ones who cry are not nearly as heartbreaking\
  \ as the ones who don\u2019t. They lie there, arms hanging out the bars of the crib,\
  \ limp. This is my sophomore year of college and I don\u2019t know much about life,\
  \ but I quickly recognize when there is no life in a child's eyes. I kept spooning\
  \ the mush, taking turns between babies, feeling increasingly helpless.\n\nGoing\
  \ into that room was like slipping into a vortex, a tear in the fabric of time that\
  \ I sometimes question as real, looking back. It could have just been a bad dream.\
  \ I don\u2019t know what I expected to find in that orphanage, but I did not expect\
  \ to find those babies. I don't know how long I was in there, but soon a member\
  \ of my group was in the doorway, telling me we were leaving. I stood up, both relieved\
  \ to be going from this place and horrified at the thought of leaving.\n\nThat was\
  \ it. A few minutes \u2014 or was it hours? \u2014 feeding pale mush to a baby in\
  \ a crib in an orphanage in Port-au-Prince. That was it.\n\nWe returned to the house\
  \ in the back of the van, tumbling over the jarring roads and trying to hold onto\
  \ the ceiling. My group members laughed and chatted. I wasn't sure if we had came\
  \ from the same orphanage. I sat at the back, afraid to look up and reveal my tears,\
  \ unable to even move my lips to make a sound.\n\n\nExactly two weeks later Elizabeth\
  \ Gilbert would publish Eat, Pray, Love and while I wouldn\u2019t read it for some\
  \ years, I\u2019d wonder how travel experiences in the same world could be so vastly\
  \ different.\n\nExactly two years later the earthquake would devastate Haiti. The\
  \ schools we had visited would close. The retreat house we stayed in would be flattened\
  \ like a pancake. The cook would lose her legs.\n\nExactly twelve years later, in\
  \ 2019, cities all over Haiti would be overcome with protests, riots, violence.\
  \ Tires would burn in the streets as embittered Haitians denounced corruption and\
  \ protested inflation, mired in economic crisis. Unable to feed their babies, still.\n\
  \nThose babies in the cribs, the ones with the flies and the urine, the mush and\
  \ the vacant stares . . . I'd never know about them."
