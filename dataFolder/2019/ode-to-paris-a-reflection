Text: Four years later and I've seen a new side of you. A hectic mix of culture, language,
  and architecture always leaves more to discover. Less than an hour before leaving
  Paris, my phone was taken in the train station. Honestly, I didn't even know it
  was missing. I thought I misplaced it in my bags. When a friend called my phone
  to help me locate it, someone picked up saying they were the police, they had my
  phone, and that they caught the man who stole it. Long story short, a group of three
  police officers met me with my phone...and the suspect. I was asked to file a police
  report so they could proceed with the arrest. I really felt conflicted...I didn't
  recognize the man and definitely didn't notice him taking my phone. I very well
  may have left it somewhere and he picked it up. I still have no idea how the police
  stopped/caught him. He allegedly had two other phones on him as well. To my relief,
  the police let me leave without a formal report since I had a train to catch. I've
  never been so face to face with another person's fate. Without having the full facts
  of how he ended up with my phone, I felt extremely uncomfortable. Beyond that though,
  I'm extremely grateful that God looked out for me on this one! Who gets their phone
  back before they even realize its stolen? There's a message about God orchestrating
  things and saving you when you don't even know you need it in there...but I'll save
  that for another story.
