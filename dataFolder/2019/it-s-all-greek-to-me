Text: "Pebble stone beaches. Dazzling sunsets. Idyllic mountainous scenery. Exquisite\
  \ blue and white traditional houses. Ahh, the sweet smell of a stereotypical \"\
  Mamma Mia\", romanticised version of Greece. \n\nForget what you've seen in Hollywood\
  \ films, and forget the postcard pictures glaring out through the glass windows\
  \ of travel agencies trying to sell you a \"hot summer deal\" to Greece. Rather,\
  \ imagine yourself catching a ferry trip to your next destination - Greece. Specifically,\
  \ Corfu, Greece. A highly underrated, and in many ways, unknown, island of Greece.\
  \ \n\nYou've just sailed half the Ionian Sea on a 12-hour journey, without a cabin\
  \ room - yes, you've been sitting on a sweaty seat in a stuffy lounge room for 12\
  \ hours! - on board with noisy families, crying babies and rowdy students. The ferry\
  \ crew give the final call to Corfu, whereby nothing is announced in English. If\
  \ you don't get off now, you're off to the next stop - Albania.\n\nYou grab that\
  \ luggage and tug it out of that ship as fast as you can, screaming at the top of\
  \ your lungs, \"wait, wait!\". You've made it safely off the ship, and onto a concrete\
  \ harbour ground, with your newly broken bag. Welcome to Greece. \n\nIt's sure a\
  \ warm welcome when you peer over the ocean, and the sun starts to peep over the\
  \ deep-blue horizon saying, \"Kalimera pethimou!\", or \"Good morning my child!\"\
  . Your heart is at home. \n\nA quick stop at the bus station's convenience store\
  \ allows you to get a cup of Greek coffee before you're on the bus headed to Acharavi,\
  \ the north of Corfu. An hour on the bus allows you to see half the island, completely\
  \ filled with lusciously green olive trees and deep blue oceans hugging the shores\
  \ of the mountains. \n\nWith not even one blue and white house in sight, this small\
  \ part of Greece is an authentic experience, it is a gem hidden under the polished\
  \ and cliche portrayal of Greece. \n\nIronically, it was no surprise that one of\
  \ the most beautiful beaches of Corfu is named \"Canal d'Amour\", meaning the \"\
  Channel of Love\". This beach truly encapsulates the romanticism of Greece so oftenly\
  \ painted in popular films. \n\nAnother stunning beach literally called \"Sunset\
  \ Beach\", is an immaculate foreground for the most beautiful sunset and sunrise\
  \ you will ever see in your life. With hot temperatures during the peak of summer,\
  \ the sun kisses your skin whilst the warm water of the Mediterranean Ocean hugs\
  \ your body. It is pure bliss. \n\nWhat I did not expect to find was the blend of\
  \ rich history and diverse diaspora within this Greek-centred Island.\n\nCorfu was\
  \ the home to many Greek-speaking Jews during World War II. Many Jews were killed\
  \ and synagogues bombed during the holocaust, leaving only a minority Jewish community\
  \ living in Corfu today. \n\nMonuments in remembrance of the Jews who died, as well\
  \ as an old, beautiful synagogue are two points of historical interest found within\
  \ the main city of Corfu. \n\nA trip to Corfu Town displays its colonial influence\
  \ from the Roman empire, as seen through the stunning Romanesque buildings and also\
  \ a \"Little Venice\" attraction in the main city square. \n\nBlending this rich\
  \ history, and mix of cultural influence, allow yourself to bite into traditional\
  \ mouth-watering Greek street food, yiro. Yiro, a Greek pita bread filled with tzatziki\
  \ yoghurt and slow-roasted meat can be bought for as little as 2 euros, and can\
  \ easily keep you full for hours with their generous Greek portions. It's also great\
  \ alongside Greece's traditional liquor - Ouzo. \n\nBe sure to take your shoes off\
  \ when you find yourself dancing the night away to some live \"bouzouki\", Greece's\
  \ traditional musical instrument, whilst breaking a few plates and celebrating your\
  \ last few moments on the island. \n\nFinally, you're building up the courage to\
  \ get back on that ferry ship and head \"home\". Your heart is left behind in Corfu.\
  \ The amount of cultural authenticity and unimaginable beauty found in Corfu, was\
  \ something I didn't expect to find. Before I know it, I am saying goodbye to all\
  \ this. Standing on this hard concrete ground, I peer over at the sun going down\
  \ and disappearing into the water. She then whispers, \"Cherete\", \"Farewell\"."
