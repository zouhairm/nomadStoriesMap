Text: "We climbed in altitude as the dry and soporific noonday heat of the Andes tapered\
  \ gradually away. In the open air of our pale blue jeep, the cool change signalled\
  \ the end of our staring contest with the climatic blow dryer that is December in\
  \ Chile. The relieved afternoon laid out unknotted. The atmosphere was pacified\
  \ but still burning away, like a post-coital cigarette. It was then, still hours\
  \ away from the Argentine border, that we came to a frontier.\n\nHaving rounded\
  \ the base of a mountain, we shrank before the chilly shade of its face as the alpine\
  \ road descended into a gully to flirt with a river. Emerging dankly from this paved\
  \ crevasse, we rose blithely as the alabaster moon in the daytime sky. The mountainside\
  \ grazed our left flank, and a gorge grew agape on our right.  Before us, the road\
  \ veered round a sharp right hand turn as the cliff-face pushed out into ever-thinning\
  \ air. We shot upward. \n\nUp ahead, a two-part semi-trailer sped into view from\
  \ behind the jutting crag. It was immediately obvious that the truck was travelling\
  \ way too fast. Having misjudged the tight angle of the corner, the driver wildly\
  \ swerved in a belated attempt to readjust. The hard turn saved the big rig from\
  \ plunging nose first over the edge, however the huge lorry was now fidgety, and\
  \ moving at speed directly toward the mountainside. The driver reflexively spun\
  \ the wheel again, this time hard to his left in order to stay on the thin sliver\
  \ of tarmac. \n\nThe truck and its first trailer swerved back onto the road, but\
  \ the rig remained heartily unsteady, and the second trailer wagged wildly behind\
  \ its more assured leader. The second trailer proceeded to swing away behind the\
  \ truck, slamming into the rock face and with the impact, flipping onto its side.\
  \ Overturned, the trailer rebounded and swung out across the road in flagrant disregard\
  \ of the solid double-yellow lines. \n\nSkidding angrily on its side perpendicular\
  \ to the opposing lane \u2013 our lane \u2013 the end was swallowing up by the inch\
  \ what had previously been uninhibited freedom. Bags of rice rag-dolled from the\
  \ truck\u2019s hold. The rolling plume of rice and dust billowed around the plummeting\
  \ steel wall as it veered across the oncoming lane, and out onto our thin gravelled\
  \ tightrope of a run-off. \n\nA silver flash of steel emerged like Themistocles\u2019\
  \ sword through the fog at Salamis. The flicker of steel hissed and rumbled across\
  \ our faces, dirt and rice assaulted our eyes; we breathed in. Roaring toward us\
  \ at speed, we knew that death was in charge of the clattering truck.\n\nMy internal\
  \ monologue in sight of death was one of solipsistic, near petulant frustration.\
  \ There are fates worse than death, the most human of those being the prospect of\
  \ it. Death is the only unanimity in life. There are climate-deniers, there are\
  \ science-deniers, there are Enlightenment deniers, but no one denies death - at\
  \ least, not for long. Nevertheless, my internal monologue in sight of death was\
  \ one of solipsistic, near petulant frustration. I didn\u2019t want it to end, I\
  \ hadn\u2019t seen enough, read enough, written enough, loved enough. \n\nThe wail\
  \ of stampeding dust, rice, and metal fell upon us like shovelfuls of interring\
  \ dirt, our convertible jeep a convertible grave. The Old Man of the Mountain teemed\
  \ down on us like the Mad River itself. But then, just as the screeching peaked\
  \ plangently about our heads signalling the inevitable crash \u2013 no impact -\
  \ the storm rattled past and fell away down the hill. The driver\u2019s foot upon\
  \ the brake hit upon the floor. \n\nThe parabola of the swinging trailer had arced\
  \ toward us, and at its farthest extent, coiled away.  Our jeep had been perched\
  \ just across the frontier of the trajectory of chaos, a beachhead of life on a\
  \ bend in the river. \n\nThe open road lay before us anew, but simply resuming after\
  \ such a close encounter felt almost flippant, at least, it did to me. I felt as\
  \ if it wouldn\u2019t be requisite of the subjectively pivotal occasion we\u2019\
  d just experienced, as if I must do something colossal, something true \u2013 maybe\
  \ I still will."
