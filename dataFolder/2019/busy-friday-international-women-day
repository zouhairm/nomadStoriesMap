Text: "In the hot morning under no-cloud sky, the young lady went to new Thiri Mingalar\
  \ market, where there was an abundance of fresh veggies, juicy fruits, beautiful\
  \ flowers, and dried seafood for wholesale rather than retailed sales. At the market,\
  \ it was crowded with people from all over Yangon even in the daytime though it\
  \ is open night as well. She went there to buy fresh, fragrant, natural roses, to\
  \ make a decorative donation at the cemetery.\n\nIn the market, she passed by shops\
  \ selling products from the sea such as various types of dried fishes, different\
  \ sizes of  dried prawns and shrimps, and  preserved fishes in salt. The pungent\
  \ smell of these products entered her respiratory system unexpectedly. She inhaled\
  \ it without thinking but though she didn\u2019t buy these things. She enjoyed her\
  \ experience just passing by, because she knew she could buy these items in the\
  \ future. \n\nAs she walked fast, she reached a building of various booths for the\
  \ sales of natural flowers. She was attracted to some aromatic Indian wormwood,\
  \ small, greenish plants, reasonably priced, and she bought a dozen of them. Then\
  \ she searched for some yellowish roses here and there. At last, she found two big\
  \ clumps of roses, precisely, a bunch of twenty in a clump. She was relieved to\
  \ be able to buy the roses she desired. After that, she left the market, passing\
  \ several buildings to get to the entrance. On her return under the midday sun,\
  \ she was joyful herself. Who knows that she felt as if there were a moonlit night\
  \ in her mind? \n\nThe woman headed to the cemetery where the Saints were buried,\
  \ by taxi. \n\nIn the large compound of the cemetery, some brick buildings like\
  \ the cottages can be seen.  Due to the phone call she received by the old man yesterday,\
  \ it was another reason she went there.  It was the sick man who had been a marine\
  \ captain as well as a flight attendant in his life, was on bed for a long time\
  \ and he waited for his death poorly and hopelessly. She had known him over five\
  \ years, before his mum passed away. Although the lady had no wish to see him for\
  \ some reasons, she went to see him as if her final greetings before his departure.\n\
  \nShe conversed with him while she was making the floral arrangement. And then,\
  \ she contributed some money, given by her little sister to him as he asked for\
  \ it via the phone. She also gave some energy drinks for electrolytes and he drank\
  \ instantly. She left him peacefully with his only one son.\n\nThen, she headed\
  \ to the Saint tombs where she desired to donate her floral arrangement. When she\
  \ arrived there, she met the security guard by chance and waited for him to cleanse\
  \ around the tombs and she gave him some tip money for his helping hands. Then she\
  \ showed her respect to the respective souls with the clean, natural flowers and\
  \ aromatic small plants that she brought. She prayed deeply, with a belief in the\
  \ seen or unseen power of angels and God, wishing for a transformation in peace\
  \ and harmony of the society.\n\nThen, the people known or uninvited such as the\
  \ Iman or  the muslim preacher, the men from management committee of the cemetery,\
  \ the people from spiritual group and faith group came to greet her and they discussed\
  \ their developmental tasks  in the cemetery and their desire to find out harmony,\
  \ resolution, peace and their personal or official problems until they found solutions.\
  \ On the one hand, she had hoped to catch her appointed class, her desirable song-writing\
  \ session, but she could not overcome their attachment to her in conversations or\
  \ informal counseling. So, she missed her lessons and the adored instructor of the\
  \ class.\n\nTo sum up, she was so sorry that she could not attend the class, even\
  \ a bit late. But a beam of light spread in her heart, after seeing her people,\
  \ because she better understood how to preserve a tangible heritage of religious\
  \ practice and spiritual belief in different communities."
