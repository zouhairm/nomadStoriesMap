Text: "Traveling abroad is fun but as part of living in the biggest country and having\
  \ not so many dollars, euros or even roubles in my pocket, I decided to reopen Russia\
  \ again many times in my life. I was always curious about all those people living\
  \ so far away but still sharing the citizenship with me. The last trip which is\
  \ hard for me to forget is to the North Caucasus. In early July I was in a small\
  \ Russian city which is in three hundred kilometers from Moscow, in Orel. it's hometown\
  \ of my friend, Olya, always proclaiming \"Orel it's a literature capital of Russia,\
  \ you know? Turgenev was from here\". One day in the literature capital of Russia\
  \ and we jumped in a car - me, Olya from Orel, her lovely mom and my other friend\
  \ Nika from Moscow who was born on the North Caucasus - the final point of our journey.\
  \ Together we drove through Rostov-on-Don, where we accidentally rented a room that\
  \ looked more like a brothel, we spent some time in Zheleznovodostk, a small town\
  \ on mineral waters, which still has an atmosphere of a Soviet rest \u2014 the history\
  \ stops in such places and the life tempo feels like it has slowed. We were the\
  \ only three young thrill-seekers in a town, climbing the mountains in the night\
  \ under the heavy rain, as well as mulberry trees with huge sugary berries. Passers-by\
  \ from the old Soviet health resorts were afraid of us. But never mind, these were\
  \ the most delicious berries in my life. Later, when Nika and I left Olya, her mother,\
  \ and their car in order to go to Nika\u2019s hometown, we sometimes saved money\
  \ for lunches eating mulberry in the villages and then rode our bicycles with red\
  \ hands and mouths. I knew that for Nika it was something like a spiritual trip\
  \ as she has not been at her hometown for 10 years. She was born in 1997 in Nalchik\
  \ - the capital of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic of Russia and the city close\
  \ to the Elbrus mountain. We went there by minibus from Pyatigorsk and our journey\
  \ then lasted more than a week. The region is culturally diverse, besides Russians,\
  \ there are Kabardians and Balkars living on the territory - ethnic groups with\
  \ Islam as religion and own languages they speak in public and families, together\
  \ with the Russian language. I was still my country's ground but I felt more like\
  \ abroad - people were different at all and it was easy to notice, for us, girls\
  \ in bright shirts and sneakers who came from Moscow, and for them - the locals.\
  \ They looked at us, and we looked at them - all these strangers and foreigners.\
  \ We were already on the city bus when Nika began to remember all the places with\
  \ which her childhood was connected, her face lit up with nostalgia - such a feeling!\
  \ Nika was also a guide who immediately spoke about the local features she knew\
  \ for sure. \"After 9 o'clock in the evening, we will not walk in the streets, at\
  \ such a time women are not allowed to walk.\" - She said to me. Indeed, the closer\
  \ it is to the evening, the fewer women are around. \"You are also not allowed to\
  \ smoke in public if you are a woman. People then immediately make a comment\".\
  \ - Added Nika. I put the pack of cigarettes back in my pocket and prepared for\
  \ the fact that it would be a wellness trip, probably there is no nightlife in the\
  \ city as well. At that time I didn\u2019t know that in the old apartment where\
  \ my friend was growing up and where we would spend these days there wouldn\u2019\
  t even be a TV. So we read books, rode bicycles, went swimming in a mountain river\
  \ and ate local pancakes with cheese - khychyny. And the city continued to become\
  \ famililar thanks to Nika\u2019s memories dispersed throughout the city. And behind\
  \ that, and around this corner, something was surely happening. Sometimes you can\
  \ just tell your friend a story from childhood, but sometimes you take your friend\
  \ across the whole country to show what you remember, and what you have already\
  \ forgotten."
