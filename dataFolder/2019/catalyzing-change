Text: "Six months ago, if you had told me that I would plan trips to Baku three consecutive\
  \ times in two months, using every last penny I had saved up, I would have - well\
  \ - bet you my bottom dollar and lost all the money regardless. Yet, there I was,\
  \ wondering how to kill time during my summer break when I came across an online\
  \ advertisement for a trip to Azerbaijan. \n\n\"Azerbaijan,\" I remember scoffing,\
  \ for \"Azer\" sounds like a Pakistani name (that just so happened to be the name\
  \ of my arch nemesis - but that's a different story for a different application\
  \ process) and \"Baijan\" sounds like \"dearest brother\" in Urdu. \"Who, in their\
  \ right mind would willingly go to a place that sounds that mundane?\" I asked myself,\
  \ while simultaneously penning my name down for the early bird discount.\n\nI didn't\
  \ believe that a homebody like myself was actually planning on embarking on this\
  \ trip. Being in a plane that faced more turbulence than my mental health during\
  \ every semester at university really cemented that as a reality, though. \n\nI\
  \ was still pretty hesitant about opening up to the idea of actually enjoying myself\
  \ in Baku, though. I was skeptical, for the tours planned seemed, well, touristy,\
  \ and I was looking for something stimulating. \n\nHowever those seven days in Baku\
  \ made me fall in love with the city's Eurasian culture - offering me enough independence\
  \ to act out in ways that I would not be able to back home in Pakistan, yet keeping\
  \ me grounded enough to know where I, myself, had to draw a line.\n\nMy time in\
  \ Baku became a macrocosm for an internal conflict that had waged a neverending\
  \ war within my mind for the longest time.\n\nCultural limitations versus independence,\
  \ liberty versus accountability; I was faced with these dilemmas that sparked the\
  \ adventure I needed, albeit within the confines of my mind. \n\nThe first time\
  \ around, I discovered that I - an antisocial creature of habit - could step out\
  \ of my comfort zone, traverse long distances in heels while drinking in the magnanimity\
  \ of stunning historical sites like the Old City, go days without food simply by\
  \ virtue of being a bit too excited, but also out of fear of using bathrooms that\
  \ weren't necessarily Pakistani-friendly (bidets are a great investment). \n\nI\
  \ discovered parts of myself I didn't know existed - parts that danced away into\
  \ the night with a drink in hand, alongside friends I met that very week, but felt\
  \ like I'd known for a lifetime because of the stories we shared. \n\nMore than\
  \ anything, I discovered that I love to travel, to meet new people and unearth stories\
  \ that reside within those who may not speak the same language, but struggle to\
  \ keep themselves afloat amidst the obstacles posed by the human condition. \n\n\
  My consequent second and third trips were just as eventful. There were even more\
  \ stories, more connections, more introspection and more exposure. Most importantly,\
  \ there was more to and of myself - way more than I knew existed. \n\nMy perspective\
  \ changed when I danced in clubs or drank at bars. It found new life when I struggled\
  \ with Google translate while talking to a single mother about how she raised her\
  \ child in a culture that was completely different from mine. It was shaken when\
  \ the sound of music could coexist with the sound of the Azaan - the Muslim call\
  \ to prayer.\n\nI came back a new person - a person who saw more, and wanted to\
  \ keep experiencing more. \n\nTraveling changes you and you don't believe that till\
  \ you experience it. As I wait to book my plane tickets to my next travel destination,\
  \ I can't help but anticipate what changes I must brace for this time around."
