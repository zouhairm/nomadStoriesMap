Text: "I ran towards the dance school along Rue de la Baume, holding on tightly to\
  \ the sling bag in front of me. It was 3:10pm. I was late, thanks to a delay on\
  \ the metro. \n \nMy eyes darted around the room. Most of the girls were leaving\
  \ with their mothers in ballet costumes. A class was ongoing. I was looking for\
  \ a skinny, blonde ten-year old when finally, I saw her coming down the stairs.\n\
  \ \n\u201CFanny!\u201D I called in relief. \n \n\u201CHi Serene,\u201D she replied.\
  \ \u201CI thought you weren\u2019t coming.\u201D \n \n\u201CSorry, I\u2019m late.\u201D\
  \ I said, out of breath. \u201CLet\u2019s go.\u201D\n \nShe smiled, put on her coat,\
  \ and we walked together back to the apartment. This was what we did every Wednesday\
  \ afternoon. This was what I was paid to do, as a part-time au pair during my student\
  \ exchange programme in Paris. I had been looking to earn some extra money to cover\
  \ my travel expenses and chanced upon the ad on an online forum.\n \nBeing fluent\
  \ in English, with basic speaking ability of French, my job was to teach three little\
  \ girls \u2013 Justine, Fanny and Alice \u2013 English once a week, and at the same\
  \ time, babysit them for the afternoon while their parents were at work (the public\
  \ schools in Paris close early on Wednesdays).\n \nAt times, I felt like their playmate.\
  \ I had no prior experience of babysitting, and they would always find ways to get\
  \ out of doing their homework to play games on the Macbook.\n \nOnce, I brought\
  \ the girls out to the nearby Park Monceau because they had finished their homework.\
  \ Along the way, Fanny found a coin on the ground, and soon the girls were scouring\
  \ the pavement for coins. Though we did not collect enough, I topped up the amount\
  \ to treat each of them a candy of their choice.\n \nAnother time, I was asked to\
  \ stay the night because their parents would be out late. We watched the entire\
  \ Titanic in the master bedroom.\n \n\u201CJe l'aime!\u201D The girls swooned when\
  \ Leonardo Di Caprio appeared on the screen. \n \n\u201CSpeak English,\u201D I reminded\
  \ them. They were instructed to practice English whenever I was around. \n \nAs\
  \ an Asian in a French-speaking country, it was difficult making friends with the\
  \ locals, including my classmates in the university. But somehow I found sisters\
  \ in a thirteen, ten and eight-year old who had nothing in common with me, apart\
  \ from our love of Titanic and Taylor Swift songs.\n \nTwo months later, I spent\
  \ my last afternoon with the girls. Justine and I sat on her bunk bed and took pictures,\
  \ Fanny hugged me and Alice drew a portrait of me on the whiteboard.\n \nThey would\
  \ not remember me today, the small Asian girl who constantly reminded them to speak\
  \ English, one of many au pairs that came before and would come after me. But I\
  \ remember them, individually. Justine, her warmth, Fanny, her kindness, and Alice,\
  \ her cheekiness. \n \nSeven years later, I made my second trip back to Paris, and\
  \ as I walked along the cobbled-stone streets, welcoming the cool autumn breeze\
  \ on my face, I found myself unintentionally looking down on the ground, hoping\
  \ to spot a coin or two."
