Text: "The golden months of 2017 were a difficult time for the remaining residents\
  \ of the Pacific Coast District of Tamarindo. The constant and immense surf which\
  \ defined the lives of Tamarindo residents past had pulled in less tourists for\
  \ that year's surfing competition, a result of nearly-constant rains. The mango-lined\
  \ estuary to the north of town recorded two-thirds of its typical influx of visitors,\
  \ and many of the local vendors chose to close early for the season, vacating the\
  \ district entirely for the hope of calmer winds further east in Veintisiete. Costa\
  \ Ricans with a little more in their pockets sojourned even further inland to Santa\
  \ Cruz. \n\nOne Costa Rican who had neither pockets nor anything to put in them\
  \ was young Bayardo San Roman, the estuary's sole faithful employee. Bayardo had\
  \ grown up between orphanages and eventually his aunt's household. His parents had\
  \ attempted to flee Columbia in 2003, unsuccessfully. He came to Tamarindo from\
  \ Columbia in 2012 with his aunt, following a truly harrowing series of events which\
  \ culminated in the murder of his uncle by his uncle's two brothers. Too young to\
  \ grasp much about the truth of his own life, Bayardo came to Tamarindo. Four years\
  \ later, he joined the eccentric employees' ranks at the estuary's nature reserve.\
  \ Bayardo's talents for the natural sciences were obvious, even at fourteen years\
  \ old, and he remained at the estuary until each of his comrades eventually departed.\n\
  \nSaid Bayardo's closest friend and penultimate remaining employee, Oscar, a twenty-two-year-old\
  \ micro-biology major, upon his departure: \"Make sure the iguanas don't get into\
  \ the boathouse, or they'll eat all the chicken pellets\". Bayardo nodded, tears\
  \ forming, and with that, Oscar turned and was gone.\n\nThe exodus of Costa Ricans\
  \ from Tamarindo served to confirm its longstanding reputation in the minds of many\
  \ Costa Ricans as \u2018Tamagringo\u2019 - destination of turtles and tourists,\
  \ but no place to build a life. Certainly, that was the case for Oscar. \n\nOne\
  \ such Tamagringo was the Premier of Manitoba, Canada's most central province, who\
  \ was late for his morning Google Hangout. Brian Pallister - Conservative politician,\
  \ nocturnal turtle-nesting fanatic, and PADI-certified scuba diver - was not reachable\
  \ by telephone, and so scheduled two sessions in his day, every day, for satisfying\
  \ his governing obligations via email. The Premier was not in Tamarindo on vacation.\
  \ He lived here - part time - though the Winnipeg Free Press had made a recent point\
  \ of alerting their constituency to the reality that he had in fact spent more time\
  \ in Tamarindo last year than he had in his elected jurisdiction. He could feel\
  \ the same accusatory heat emanating from his colleagues on Hangouts as he could\
  \ from his prairie-bound wife Esther, when they spoke (infrequently).\n\nHis office\
  \ was tucked into a perpetually-shaded corner (compliments of a monstrous Andiroba),\
  \ just off Tamarindo's main thoroughfare. As he stood in his doorway, his hands\
  \ fumbling annoying for his keys, which then hit the ground suddenly with a bracing\
  \ racket, he felt dizzy. Then it wasn't him who was reeling, but the earth underneath\
  \ him, and the rest of the world with it - and Manitoba's most senior government\
  \ official was caught unceremoniously in the epicentrum of a moderate earthquake.\
  \ \n\nAs Bayardo San Roman darted out of the alley adjacent to the Premier's lot,\
  \ he acted without thinking, feeling a wave of unstable earth shudder beneath him,\
  \ and immediately grabbing the gringo by the front of his shirt and rushing them\
  \ both in a linebacker's tackle out of the condo's entryway. Seconds later, the\
  \ Andiroba crashed clean through the awning under which the Premier had just stood.\
  \ As their eyes met, the Premier's betrayed his terror and bewilderment. Worse than\
  \ his own fear, though, was what he saw looking back at him - a deep, alienating\
  \ sadness emanating from the boy, so crystalline in its purity that it would not\
  \ yield to any other thing, even the horror of assured destruction.  \n\nThe Premier\
  \ boarded a plane the next day, a malaise eating at him as he contemplated the figures\
  \ growing smaller in the rubble that would soon be a distant memory. This memory\
  \ would fail to appear in his autobiographical work, published many years after\
  \ he stopped returning to Tamarindo."
