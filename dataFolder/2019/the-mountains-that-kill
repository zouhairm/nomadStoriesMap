Text: "I saw free animals roaming in streets, meadows and mountains. My first impression\
  \ was that Bani Malik was just like Khalil Gibran\u2019s stories. Goats were wandering\
  \ inside a grocery store; donkeys searching for food near a dumpster; a family of\
  \ monkeys crossing the road; a couple of camels stuck in traffic behind us;. Dead\
  \ cars were resting by the road, and faceless vehicles were still working. An LX\
  \ V6 Toyota held migrant workers in the back with small water tanks, stuffed bags,\
  \ stacks of hay and a herd of sheep. \nPeople with wrinkled dark skins were sitting\
  \ on a restaurant\u2019s doorstep. Colorful flower crowns bordered their heads.\
  \ They had long, black, curly hair and thick resting brows. Their skirts looked\
  \ like carpets. And for a moment, I questioned whether I was in Saudi still. I wondered\
  \ why these women were unveiled. I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off of them. The more\
  \ I looked, the more I knew, they were men.\nThe slow-motion glimpse passed when\
  \ our car moved, and the view changed into a small boy. He was probably seven years\
  \ of age, selling miswaks on the road. I was still sleepy, and I felt ashamed of\
  \ myself. The boy looked sleepy too. I saw other boys his age walking to school\
  \ with their books wrapped in a prayer rug and stabled with a strap. The view changed\
  \ from the boys to the mountains. \nThe succession of Faifa Mountains manifest in\
  \ white, grey, sky blue, and even a lighter shade of blue. Then they fade. And in\
  \ the front, there were the mountains, brown. On both sides of the highway. Tanned\
  \ and covered in big cracks that I couldn\u2019t help but imagine how it would be\
  \ to rock-climb them\u2014not that I ever attempted such a sport. \nThe mountains\
  \ were sprinkled with colorful houses. My friend told me they\u2019re not all Faifa.\
  \ The tribes very few know about reside in the mountains of Faifa, Hashir, Ghazu\
  \ and Raith in the south of Saudi Arabia. People of all colors and backgrounds have\
  \ settled there. Now they share one ancestor. My friend told me every time a tourist\
  \ group visits Ghahar (Agony) Mountain, at least one person finds his fate. \nThe\
  \ tribes in the mountains don\u2019t follow state law. They have their own government\
  \ and their own rules, including capital punishment. Every tribe\u2019s big sheikh\
  \ is in charge of solving conflicts. Marriages don\u2019t get registered in court\
  \ either.\nShe told me about all of those who die from injustice, and the blood\
  \ the mountains, the valleys, the rocks, the caves and the waterfalls shed. She\
  \ told me about the men with knives\u2014no advanced weapons who killed the men\
  \ of King Abdul Aziz before he conquered and united these Yemeni mountains to Saudi\
  \ Arabia. \n\u201CI don\u2019t like my tribe,\u201D she said.\nFrom the car window,\
  \ soldiers were standing with rifles in their hands. \nI was scared the first time.\
  \ Now I just try not to look at the guns. We arrive to the military checking point,\
  \ and I place the black veil over my face."
