Text: "12-sided church. Based on Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre.  Circular\
  \ nave inner temple. Knights Templar secret rites. 1km hike down!\n\nI was loosely\
  \ flipping through my Lonely Planet guidebook whilst trekking down the old 1st century\
  \ aqueduct city of Segovia, strong in my resolve to find a low inclined spot to\
  \ frame my best photo composition of the imposing Alcazar tower and Segovia old\
  \ city walls, despite the looming storm clouds and long-lasting drizzle, almost\
  \ giving my day trip an uncanny likeness to the atmospheric set of Games of Thrones.\
  \ A stone cross, set against a \u2018fused\u2019 Romanesque dodecagonal hall and\
  \ a Moorish-influenced Minaret-like tower. \u201CThat\u2019s a sibei lao rojak building!\u201D\
  \ (sibei lao \u2013 very old, in Hokkein dialect; rojak \u2013 mixed, in Malay),\
  \ I exclaimed in my naturalized \u2018Singlish\u2019. Just so you know, I was just\
  \ in awe of the 1st century aqueducto arches welcoming me into the old Segovia city\
  \ a couple of hours ago, and here\u2019s the 13th century Iglesia de la Vera Cruz,\
  \ which I termed as sibei lao. Well, you can\u2019t blame my sense of chronological\
  \ mathematics, my homeland, Singapore, is celebrating its bicentennial anniversary\
  \ this year\u2026 \u2026bicentennial since its founding, and not independence. Singapore\
  \ only gained its independence in 1965, unwillingly so\u2026 \u2026 our first Prime\
  \ Minister and \u2018founding father\u2019, Lee Kuan Yew, made the announcement\
  \ to its people, nope, not in fire and fury, but in much angst and distress.\n\n\
  As Singaporeans, we\u2019re no strangers to rojak. My Hokkein ancestors not only\
  \ mingled with the rest of the Chinese dialect groups; Teochews, Cantonese, Hakkas;\
  \ but also, with Malay, Indian and Eurasian (mixed European and Asian) immigrants.\
  \ There\u2019s also the Peranakans, people of mixed Chinese and Malay/Indonesian\
  \ heritage, in which our \u2018founding father\u2019, Lee Kuan Yew, is one of the\
  \ most prominent ones.\n\nI guess no matter 13th century or 19th century, Europe\
  \ or Asia, we\u2019re never too far from having some rojak in our lives. By the\
  \ way, if you\u2019re visiting Singapore, I\u2019ll recommend that you check out\
  \ a local salad of mixed vegetables and fruits, drizzled with a sweet and sour sauce\
  \ comprising local prawn paste, sugar and lime. Oh, its name, you asked? Like I\u2019\
  ve mentioned, we\u2019re never too far from having some rojak in our lives. You\
  \ still didn\u2019t get it? Rojak, you sibei slow leh (leh \u2013 a word filler\
  \ in Hokkein dialect)."
