Text: "Expecting a long wait, I headed towards an inviting bench in the sunshine.\
  \ Tucked away in a semi-quaint side street, the view over-looked Copacabana Beach\
  \ where I\u2019d be able to observe some of the talent playing volleyball. It was\
  \ only ten in the morning, yet the activities were already in full swing and every\
  \ body type possible were proudly swaying their hips across the sand. \nContent\
  \ to sit alone and reflect on the adventure so far, we locked eyes suddenly. The\
  \ man approaching was studying me so intensely it was as though we\u2019d just found\
  \ each other again, after thirty years of separation. His warm, green eyes, pale\
  \ skin and grey hair didn\u2019t give him a typically Brazilian look. He was gentle\
  \ looking, of slight build and I was intrigued to converse immediately, feeling\
  \ an overwhelming sense of familiarity towards him.\n\u201CBest restaurant in Rio!\u201D\
  \ He proclaimed, pointing towards the small hole in the wall which looked like a\
  \ back street mother\u2019s kitchen. The type of place that only the locals know\
  \ about, which serves the most authentic Brazilian food and is a fraction of the\
  \ price of any other establishment in this hot spot. \u201CI\u2019ve been going\
  \ there my whole life! Can you believe I\u2019m 67?\u201D I couldn\u2019t. He was\
  \ childlike yet had the face of a knowing man. It was obvious he would have been\
  \ quite the James Dean in his younger days.\nThe usual awkwardness of a first meet\
  \ and the expected window frame of small talk didn\u2019t exist in this scenario.\
  \ The minute we started talking, it was as if we\u2019d known each other a life\
  \ time. I enjoyed feeling comfortable and submerged myself in the moment, transfixed\
  \ by the wisdom of his eyes, eyes which told many a stories before he had even begun\
  \ to speak.  As he began to tell his tales of life in the favela, surviving cancer\
  \ and his career as a football coach, my only hope was that my friend\u2019s visit\
  \ to the Western Union branch would take even longer than expected. \nWe discussed\
  \ wealth and he told me he\u2019d had it once but had given it all up for a life\
  \ in the favela. Cancer had taught him the real meaning of life and the importance\
  \ of community. \u201CI\u2019m not supposed to be here,\u201D he explained. \u201C\
  I was stage 4, my stomach was finished and now here I am enjoying pork. I come here\
  \ every day, it\u2019s the only place to eat in Rio.\u201D I toyed with the idea\
  \ of sharing some of my own tales of life on the road but didn\u2019t want to waste\
  \ the time we had talking too much about myself. Listening to him was a more rewarding\
  \ experience. Regardless, his questions led to the discovery of my life\u2019s journey\
  \ so far. Of course, a man with this dignity carried an army of social graces too.\
  \  \nAs my best friend\u2019s head appeared from around the corner of the road,\
  \ I shamefully felt disappointed to see her. My new companion granted her a warm\
  \ smile, as I\u2019m sure he did most people, and they shared a small exchange.\
  \ It was time for us to leave, his charm and wit still coating my clothes. \nGull\
  \ offered to take a picture of us as we said our farewells. Lifestyles exchanged\
  \ within the flash of time. A firm bond made, happiness felt. I\u2019d never see\
  \ him again in my life and I never even asked him his name, that mystery man of\
  \ Copacabana."
