Text: "Dear Grazia,\n\t\n\nI sit at my cluttered desk looking out the window in this\
  \ winter moonlight. I have shards of pana carasau in my left hand, some pecorino\
  \ in my right, and my tongue, like my head, is full of mirto. I had succumbed to\
  \ its initial sweetness, but it is now growing tentacles of thoughts inside me.\
  \ Usually these thoughts merely percolate and eventually disappear, but tonight\
  \ the mirto makes me take this pen and ask you some questions. \n\nI write this\
  \ not as a response to an imagined question, like Virginia Woolf\u2019s Three Guineas,\
  \ but as the question itself. Woolf responded to a gentleman asking female opinion\
  \ on how to prevent wars. She acknowledges the rarity of such a question to women\
  \ in the first place. But I write from a time and place where despite many wars\
  \ of many kinds, you and I, Grazia - or GD, if I may - we are still, across centuries,\
  \ fighting the same battle: to be left to ourselves, so we could be and write as\
  \ ourselves, without judgment. As a younger woman writer also from a corner of the\
  \ world, I am curious about how you went about it.\n\nHow ambitious it sounds, this\
  \ daringness to just be, as is, without farce or embellishment. But you had it,\
  \ GD, you were ambitious in a town that valued domesticity above all else in its\
  \ women. And no wonder \u2013 you read and wrote in a nearly illiterate Nuoro, and\
  \ it made you have visions of things and ideas far removed from the reality of shepherds\
  \ and bandits. \n\nYou wanted to create, and isn\u2019t that the province of God,\
  \ to make something out of nothing, to create value out of ordinary things usually\
  \ deemed worthless? We still do it today, the way Pinuccio Sciola in San Sperate\
  \ spends years cutting trachyte stone so that it transforms. It becomes, with his\
  \ careful fashioning of holes and lines, a thing alive and most unstonelike. It\
  \ plays music and moves like elastic. Music from stone is not a new thing for me,\
  \ GD. I have heard such sounds, muted and restrained, in 56 stone pillars in temple\
  \ hall ruins dating from around the 16th century in Hampi, Karnataka, located in\
  \ the South of India. The Vittala Temple belonged to the Vijayanagara Empire (1336-1646\
  \ AD), built by King Krishnadevaraya. The pillars emitted musical notes when hit\
  \ by human hands, and produced clear notes of Carnatic music. The tour guides there\
  \ liked to describe how His Majesty the King would withdraw to this smaller, cooler\
  \ hall after his prayers in the main temple complex, and refresh himself with such\
  \ entertainment. It was a minor ritual of inner transformation before he returned\
  \ to the mundane duties of state administration. Creativity, for Sciola and Krishnadevaraya,\
  \ came from a primal source, almost divine. These stones in the process have become\
  \ most unlike themselves, but draws us to them for that very reason.\n\nBut art\
  \ takes on even more entrenched qualities for us, GD, as we come from places so\
  \ particular, with ancient histories not of our making but requiring our veneration\
  \ nonetheless. I think you understand that very well. I was made to visit South\
  \ India annually as a teenager, in order to understand my heritage. One of such\
  \ trips included a visit to Gangaikondacholapuram, an ancient temple-city in Tamil\
  \ Nadu dating from the 11th Century. I had been more interested in the sacred well\
  \ this temple had, with a lion sculpture as its guardian, called simhakeni. You\
  \ would have grown up observing the phallic Nuraghe tower-fortresses and perhaps\
  \ seen the Sacred Pit of Santa Christina that has survived from the Nuraghic Age,\
  \ and, who in their time of 1900 \u2013 730 BC knew where to build these so they\
  \ could control important travel passages. \n\nAnd so our individual, shared particularities\
  \ perhaps cancel each other out, leaving behind a common residue of heritage. We\
  \ have always known how artefacts from such forgotten pasts, also a kind of art,\
  \ can both liberate as well as enslave us. When we acknowledge our histories, we\
  \ also acknowledge its continuity, and the part we play in maintaining that continuity."
