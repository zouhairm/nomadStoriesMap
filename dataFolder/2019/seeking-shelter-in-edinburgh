Text: "Perched on the far end of the George IV Bridge, The Elephant House is an understated\
  \ and unglamorous caf\xE9. The hot cuppas that beckon from inside are warm, inviting,\
  \ but not exceptional, yet still tourists\u2019 faces float like ghosts in the misty\
  \ windows, trying to steal a glance of one of the rickety wooden tables at which\
  \ J.K. Rowling penned the first words of her wizarding world back in the 1990s.\
  \ For Rowling, coming to The Elephant House had a very practical end; paying for\
  \ a coffee was far cheaper than having to heat her apartment in the merciless Edinburgh\
  \ winters. \n\nAs a woman looking to make the most of what little means she had,\
  \ Rowling harnessed the inspiration that her city gave her in a way that few others\
  \ ever could, and made unprecedented literary history. Edinburgh itself has also\
  \ had such a journey, rising from the earth despite endless plague and power struggles.\
  \ It is just beyond the caf\xE9 where not only the sorcery of Rowling's story, but\
  \ also the legend of Scotland\u2019s history took root. Resting immediately under\
  \ the rear windows of The Elephant House is the muddied soil of The Greyfriars Kirkyard,\
  \ where over half a million bodies have been interned since the early 17th century.\
  \ This Kirkyard houses gravestone with names that may ring familiar to the modern\
  \ reader: Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley, and even a Mr. Thomas Riddell. What\
  \ this graveyard is most known for, however, isn\u2019t the innocent magic of a\
  \ certain book series\u2014 rather it is Sir George Mackenzie\u2019s Poltergeist.\
  \ \n\nThe bloodthirsty ghost is the original subject of virtually every modern horror\
  \ story, ranging from Bram Stoker\u2019s \u201CDracula\u201D to Mary Shelley\u2019\
  s \u201CFrankenstein.\u201D For over two hundred years the specter has been one\
  \ of, if not the most recorded subject of paranormal activity in the world, but\
  \ the haunting began with a renewed fervor in 1998 when a homeless man decided to\
  \ take shelter from the rain in Sir George Mackenzie\u2019s tomb. After breaking\
  \ the heavily fortified lock on the door, the homeless man plummeted through a hollow\
  \ floor and landed in a mass plague grave. He managed to escape into the night,\
  \ and it seemed that some spirit was able to follow him out. \n\nIn the weeks subsequent\
  \ to the grave\u2019s desecration, the Council of Edinburgh determined that nobody\u2019\
  s safety could be guaranteed near the tomb, and sealed it off completely to outsiders.\
  \ That doesn\u2019t stop people from trying to enter. Despite the locks and chains\
  \ that bind the gates closed, the desperate homeless of Edinburgh have no other\
  \ place to take shelter. In an interview with the Edinburgh Evening News, a Kirkyard\
  \ tour guide comments on how the poltergeist's \u201CStreet of Death\u201D also\
  \ houses the poor. \u201CThey still come in,\u201D he says. \u201CHard to imagine\
  \ but they\u2019ve nowhere else to go.\u201D \n\nBear with me, here.\n\nGiven the\
  \ current political climate of the world, I\u2019ve had my mind on the idea of shelter.\
  \ \u201CNo one leaves home unless / home is the mouth of a shark,\u201D writes Somali\
  \ poet Warsan Shire. At this very moment in time I have a visa to study abroad in\
  \ the United Kingdom, much like many of my peers at University have visas to study\
  \ from Iraq, Iran, and Yemen. But while I have a choice, they do not; while I was\
  \ born into a nation that accepted me, they grew up trying to bridge a seemingly\
  \ endless cultural divide. In Trump\u2019s America, after all, it is \u201Cme\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cyou,\u201D \u201Cus\u201D and \u201Cthem,\u201D and nothing more.\n\n\
  I think of all of those who took shelter in countries that weren\u2019t theirs.\
  \ I think of the homeless who found refuge in the darkest  places. I think of the\
  \ authors who write to change the world in little cafes in little cities. Because\
  \ in the words of such an author, \u201CWe do not need magic to change the world.\
  \ We carry all the power we need within ourselves already: we have the power to\
  \ imagine better.\u201D\n\nSo please, let\u2019s imagine."
