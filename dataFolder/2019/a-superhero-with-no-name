Text: "I had argued with my brother the day before when suddenly, he was the only\
  \ person I could trust or feeling save; well, that is what I thought at the beginning.\
  \ Not only we were lost in translation but also in another city that I just had\
  \ heard in a web series recently. \n\nI was in shock when the driver \u2014an old\
  \ French man with a big nose and a lot of forehead wrinkles\u2014 said, \"Utrecht\"\
  \ instead of Amsterdam. The driver kicked us out of the bus \u2014at 6 a.m.\u2014\
  \ with a foreign couple and the tallest man I have ever seen. \n\nThere, at the\
  \ small bus stop, I told my brother I was sure we had not taken the wrong bus. I\
  \ looked at him he was nervous and shaking, it was cold for someone who \u2014literally\u2014\
  \ lives in a warm city all year.  \"Maybe plans changed when we were sleeping and\
  \ we have not listened\", I said. \n\nThe first minutes are just blurred to me now.\
  \ I remember approaching the couple and asked them where they were supposed to get.\
  \  The brown skin guy showed me their bus reservation and I said, \u201Cwe were\
  \ going to the same place\u201D. He did not speak English well and told me he was\
  \ from Brazil. \n\nThen, the tallest man talked to my brother and offered his help,\
  \ \"the train station is close to here, I can take you there, we are going to be\
  \ in less than 5 minutes\".  The worst scenario crossed my mine because I am from\
  \ Mexico, the country is dealing with kidnapping, drug cartels so every time you\
  \ have to be aware of what is happening around you. I had to stop overthinking and\
  \ hoping everything would be fine.\n\nFollowing him in those lonely streets, I barely\
  \ could see anything and then I saw it\u2014the light at the end of the tunnel\u2014\
  \ a clock from the Utrecht Centraal railway station Station.  \"Here we are,\" said\
  \ our guide and he let us there. I felt better and the cultural adventure began.\
  \ \n\nOn the screens, I read words \u2014places\u2014 that did not mean anything\
  \ to me. \"Which train should we take?\", my brother and I did not see anyone we\
  \ could talk in that big and crowded but \u2014somehow\u2014 quiet station. Then,\
  \ the tallest man appeared again and asked us where we were going to. He checked\
  \ an app on his cellphone and told us which one we had to take. Also, he helped\
  \ us to buy our tickets and even wanted to pay but we did not let him do that. \n\
  \n\"I am taking you to your train\", he was walking so fast and we were tired \u2014\
  first time carrying a backpack of 9 kilos each other\u2014. \"It is this one. It\
  \ is divided into two: you can talk on that side and you can not on the other\"\
  . I thought, \u201Cthat is weird but interesting, I guess\u201D. I realised we forgot\
  \ to ask him his name and just said, \"Thank you so much for everything\".  \n\n\
  We got into the \"silence zone\"; my brother and I sat in front of a woman who was\
  \ sleeping and did not notice us. Our seats smelled as if someone had thrown up\
  \ and I just smirked at my brother and he did the same. We were together and ready\
  \ to have fun; that is all that matters."
