Text: "The decision came down to a stone, a small tiny pebble who\u2019s answer we\
  \ chose to ignore. It started by hopping into the back of a shared taxi with strangers,\
  \ whom after this initial ride, we would never meet again, as we drove to the Kuang\
  \ Si Waterfalls, just outside of Luang Prabang. \n\nThe hike up was steep having\
  \ chosen the more difficult side to climb, thinking our descent along the other\
  \ would be more manageable, though we never made it, nor did we exit the park the\
  \ same way we came in. It was hot and sweaty, but slowly the thunderous roar of\
  \ the waterfall trickled away into the background as we reached the peak. Basking\
  \ in this more peaceful area of small pools and fewer crowds, we wandered across\
  \ the top stumbling upon a slightly battered sign advertising a spring and cave.\
  \ Our curious nature overtook, following the arrow we soon landed outside the park\
  \ along a dirt road. \n\nArriving at the spring first, our time was consumed with\
  \ the hilarious activity of challenging a local to cross a log without falling in.\
  \ If you won he would reward you with a beer, and if you lost you had to purchase\
  \ one. Trying ourselves, and then watching other tourists attempt this feat kept\
  \ us from finding the cave, as we realized the time and how late we'd be meeting\
  \ up with our shared ride. \n\nHurrying back, our ears caught the sound of music\
  \ pumping from within the forest. Knowing, either way, we\u2019d be late, we ventured\
  \ forth to see what we would encounter. Following a windy path through the trees,\
  \ it opened unto a clearing, where a bunch of Laotians were dancing, drinking and\
  \ eating. As they tried to get us to join, we hesitated, not for the fact that we\
  \ didn\u2019t want to, but because we knew we\u2019d run the risk of not having\
  \ a way back into town. Wrestling with the idea of what to do, flipping a coin became\
  \ the option, but Laos doesn\u2019t have any coins so we settled with choosing which\
  \ hand the stone was in. Unfortunately, the guess was wrong as the pebble fell from\
  \ the other hand leaving both of us disappointed, but it was in this moment that\
  \ we decided to ignore the answer because we knew these opportunities do not pop\
  \ up often. Grabbing drinks, we sat with a small group, one of which spoke English,\
  \ and the thought of how we\u2019d get back slipped slowly to the wayside. \n\n\
  His name was Ding and he did the translating for us. This party in the woods was\
  \ a celebration for which the meaning we could not quite understand. He worked for\
  \ an elephant camp and described his love of his job because he got to talk with\
  \ foreigners, and his friends, well they loved to cheers and make you hastily down\
  \ your drink. Quickly a few hours had passed and with the music slowly dying Ding\
  \ invited us back to his house. We tried to assess whether this was a good idea\
  \ or not as Ding pulled his bike from the bushes, but next thing you know the 3\
  \ of us piled on one bike for the small drive down the hillside. Arriving in the\
  \ village he promptly sent his small son out to get some beers. Before long he was\
  \ off to fetch his wife leaving us and his son alone in the house, with the promise\
  \ we would not go anywhere until he returned. Where he thought we\u2019d venture\
  \ too was unbeknownst to us as we had no idea where we actually were. Soon enough\
  \ he was back, this time with a case full of beers. After a few more hours, drinking,\
  \ chatting and eating soup made by his wife, he arranged a ride back into Luang\
  \ Prabang with his friend. \n\nThe time had come to leave his house. We said our\
  \ goodbyes and exchanged emails before piling into the back of the pickup truck.\
  \ Huddled on the floor against the now cold night air of the mountains, we smiled\
  \ to each other and were thankful that everything worked out perfectly in the end."
