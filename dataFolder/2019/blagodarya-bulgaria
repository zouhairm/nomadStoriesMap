Text: "I always say I live to travel and gain more life each time I travel. I say\
  \ that because of the way my heart beats faster whenever my plane is landing somewhere\
  \ new. Because of the warm feeling I get when I am making my bags. The way in which\
  \ my ears feel like they are listening to music when I hear a different language.\
  \ And the purpose of getting to know new cultures, cuisine, landscapes, and people.\
  \ Each one of these things make my stomach flutter and make life worthwhile. \n\n\
  It wasn\u2019t any different when I arrived in Sofia, Bulgaria, on July 2nd 2018.\
  \ Although many people may have heard of Sofia, Bulgaria is not a place most would\
  \ associate with tourism. Maybe it\u2019s the language, Bulgarian, with its Cyrillic\
  \ alphabet, that can be a bit scary when you don\u2019t know any similar languages.\
  \ Or it can be the lack of understanding of Bulgarian culture, where you can find\
  \ a population that is pretty straightforward and attached to tradition. However\
  \ you may feel, though, I can promise Sofia is a must-see in one\u2019s lifetime.\n\
  \nIt all starts with the wonderful sights, such as the St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral,\
  \ with splendent golden domes that at night make you feel as if you are seeing something\
  \ straight from an oasis. As you walk through the streets (if you are feeling fancy,\
  \ you can take on Vitosha Boulevard) you\u2019ll stumble across Bulgaria\u2019s\
  \ amazing cuisine, which is anything but ordinary. In the menu, you\u2019ll find\
  \ Sarmi (cabbage or vine leaves filled with meat and rice), Banitsa (pastry filled\
  \ with cheese, yogurt and eggs), or one of their typical soups, Tarator (you\u2019\
  ll find that Bulgarians really love their soups). Bulgarians can also really take\
  \ their alcohol, and in the bar you can ask for a Rakia (a strong drink distilled\
  \ from fruits), Menta (a mint-based drink) or just a really good craft beer.\n\n\
  And it was exactly when I was looking for one of those beers when I discovered one\
  \ of Sofia\u2019s biggest qualities: the people. Brazil was playing against Mexico\
  \ on the World Cup as I entered a bar that made its own beer, located close to the\
  \ St. George Rotunda (another must see - a church that is dated all the way back\
  \ to the 300s). I was a bit shy, especially not knowing anything about the local\
  \ language, and I could see that the people in the bar were mostly cheering for\
  \ Mexico. However, I couldn\u2019t keep the Brazilian in me quiet and ended up cheering\
  \ loudly when Brazil scored its first goal, and I could feel the stares as the room\
  \ went silent. I was almost about to leave when this woman (Maria, as I would later\
  \ find out), came to talk to me and starting asking about Brazil and if I was enjoying\
  \ Bulgaria so far. That day, I ended up not only getting a free beer, but also a\
  \ warm heart from meeting wonderful people. And that happened not only once, but\
  \ many times throughout my short 6-day stay in Sofia. I would meet people who, even\
  \ barely speaking English, would help me find my way around town with a kind smile,\
  \ or would patiently try to teach me how to pronounce thank you (\u201Cblagodarya\u201D\
  ), as I repeated it a thousand times. \n\nOnce again, this experience taught me\
  \ how there will be wonderful people no matter where you go. Sure, you\u2019ll struggle\
  \ a bit, as you try to figure exactly what you are ordering or what does \u0414\u043E\
  \u0431\u0440\u0435 \u0434\u043E\u0448\u043B\u0430 mean (it means \u201Cwelcome\u201D\
  , by the way). However, you'll see that no country is a great mystery as long as\
  \ you are willing to talk to people, understand and respect the local culture. With\
  \ an open mind, you are most definitely going to immerse yourself in a wonderful\
  \ new universe."
