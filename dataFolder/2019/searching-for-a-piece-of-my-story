Text: "I stood beneath the foreboding Victorian structure that Dickens could have\
  \ created for Oliver Twist. The modern facade to accommodate apartments masked its\
  \ infamous origins. \n\nTwo days earlier, my boyfriend and I began exploring the\
  \ towns and surrounding areas where my ancestors lived, loved and left for a life\
  \ in New Zealand. \n\nOur rental car glided past a green kaleidoscope of rolling\
  \ fields as Google Maps sent us willingly to Coventry.  In contrast to the original\
  \ meaning of \u201Cbeing sent to Coventry\u201D, we weren\u2019t facing exclusion\
  \ from a place or group. \n\nWe detoured to Shakespeare\u2019s birthplace, Stratford\
  \ Upon Avon to pay our respects to \u201CThe Bard\u201D. Before scribing a sonnet\
  \ or producing a play, Shakespeare spent his childhood in a modest half-timbered\
  \ dwelling considered affluent for the period. The house contained a parlor, kitchen\
  \ and large fireplace at ground level with upstairs living quarters. Arriving after\
  \ closing time, we peered through diamond shaped glass window panes, while envisioning\
  \ smoldering ash crackling in the fireplace as Shakespeare recited his prose above.\
  \ \n\u201CI like this place and could willingly waste my time in it\u201D \u2013\
  \ As You Like It\n\nRegretfully, our tight schedule meant we couldn\u2019t explore\
  \ the attractions dedicated to Shakespeare\u2019s legacy, or relax on the River\
  \ Avon as resident swans and ducks floated past. \n\nArriving in Kenilworth, we\
  \ ambled along the Old Town High Street, past coordinated red and white brick listed\
  \ buildings, where flowers in vivid colors hung from baskets. A welcoming sign on\
  \ Kenilworth's oldest pub, the Virgins and Castle (1563) promoted the venue as a\
  \ frequent Shakespeare haunt and community meeting place. \n\nWe reached the 13th\
  \ century St Nicholas Church where my forbears heard wedding bells chime and saw\
  \ rosy cheeked babies baptized. I knew I wouldn't find my 3rd great-grandmother\
  \ among the forgotten graves in the cemetery. She sealed her fate when boarding\
  \ a cramped ship to New Zealand, where she settled on the rugged West Coast.  In\
  \ an 1868 newspaper obituary, witnesses described a thunderous boom during a violent\
  \ storm. With no lightening in the turbulent sky, they sprinted towards the nearest\
  \ house. Discovering a fallen tree among the rubble, they pulled tangled branches\
  \ from a lifeless middle aged man. Then watched his wife take her last shallow breaths\
  \ - leaving six orphaned children behind. \n\nA visit to Kenilworth is not complete\
  \ without a stop at Kenilworth Castle, a 12th century architectural achievement,\
  \ now in ruins. In its prime the castle held lavish celebrations for medieval monarchs\
  \ and Tudor nobility. During these feasts, a giant mere (a man-made lake) surrounding\
  \ the ancient fortress protected it from invaders intent on destruction.  \n\nThe\
  \ castle attracts tourists eager to see the rooms where Elizabeth I stayed, and\
  \ speculation that while a guest she organized secret rendezvous with her lover\
  \ Robert Dudley. The elevated three-story Norman Keep, where guards kept watch centuries\
  \ ago, provides a perfect vantage point for panoramic views over adjacent fields.\n\
  \nWiltshire greeted us with sloping plains, flat green meadows, and roadside elms.\
  \ It\u2019s renowned for hidden archaeological treasures, including Avebury, the\
  \ region\u2019s answer to Stonehenge. This smaller world heritage site features\
  \ asymmetrical stones, stained and weathered from years exposed to the elements.\
  \ Overgrown grass licked our knees as we weaved between the mysterious stones and\
  \ contemplated their purpose. \n\nIn Trowbridge, where other relatives once resided,\
  \ honey colored limestone Georgian buildings surrounded the town square, with a\
  \ clock tower overseeing the contemporary storefronts below. \n\nAccording to family\
  \ folklore, my ancestors here concealed their ages to escape from a bleak future.\
  \ Their destination New Zealand, two small islands in the vast Pacific Ocean. This\
  \ recent commonwealth addition welcomed settlers under 40 after an arduous journey.\
  \ \n\nI recalled my 95-year-old great aunt\u2019s remarks that our destitute ancestors\
  \ spent time in the workhouse, and questioned if the building could still exist?\n\
  \nGoogle answered, and 30 minutes later I found myself in a rural location that\
  \ hid the poor from view during the industrial revolution. \n\nAs twilight summoned\
  \ the setting sun, I wondered if the present occupants were aware of the controversy\
  \ and suffering within its walls? I might never know, but standing in its shadow,\
  \ it intertwined with my history and now I was a piece of its story too."
