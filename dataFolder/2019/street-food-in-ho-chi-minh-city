Text: "After nearly a month in Vietnam I was still struggling to comprehend the complexities\
  \ of the war and the details of how and why the north and south of the country had\
  \ been divided. Before visiting this lively and diverse country, my encounter with\
  \ the conflict here had been limited to American soldiers who\u2019d fought, portrayed\
  \ in films and media as heros for surviving the atrocities. I didn\u2019t even realise\
  \ that the US had lost. Although, none of these thoughts were particularly on my\
  \ mind as Kate and I dodged thousands of scooters which were weaving in and out\
  \ of the heavier traffic. City grime stuck to our sweaty skin as we flip flopped\
  \ our way across Ho Chi Minh City, towards the Independence Palace. One of the city\u2019\
  s main attractions, the 1966 building sits atop the site of other, older structures\
  \ connected to the occupations of both France and Japan. The end of the American\
  \ War was declared here, and today it admits thousands of tourists throughout the\
  \ year. Just not at lunch time. Finding the door locked, lights off and gates shut\
  \ did little to improve our moods after our long walk. The Palace had just closed\
  \ for lunch hour, so we thought we\u2019d do the same. \n\nAs a vegetarian in a\
  \ meat-loving country, I\u2019d done a bit of homework on where to eat, but as we\
  \ entered the air-conditioned restaurant and were handed heavy English menus we\
  \ soon slipped out again. Vietnamese food is amazing, and we wanted authentic local\
  \ food, not a tourist trap with tourist prices. Pavements aren\u2019t just for walking\
  \ on in Ho Chi Minh City - they\u2019re for parking your scooter on, setting up\
  \ shop and for eating on too. I\u2019d grown used to the abundance of fresh herbs\
  \ supplied at every meal, which you could rip into your soup or eat alongside every\
  \ dish to customise it to your own preference. Street vendors set up their cooking\
  \ equipment and some tiny plastic stools next to parked scooters or just off the\
  \ main street in an alleyway and are joined by all sorts of people for their midday\
  \ meal. Kate spotted some meaty dish she liked the look of and settled herself between\
  \ a suited gentleman and a bearded backpacker. I only had to wander a couple of\
  \ metres to find a meat-free offering. A tiny, little old lady was cooking on a\
  \ huge flat pan over a gas stove, surrounded by partially unidentifiable ingredients.\
  \ I wish I could have asked her what they were but Vietnamese is an extremely hard\
  \ language to learn due to the specific intonation required. Fortunately the two\
  \ other customers on their tiny blue stools spoke English and happily explained\
  \ that we were about to eat fried tapioca with spring onions, noodles, egg and chili\
  \ sauce, and the obligatory herbs. As we waited for our chef to serve our lunch\
  \ they asked about my trip and where else I\u2019d visited. I enquired about their\
  \ lives, one lady had moved to the city to study and was working in a shoe shop,\
  \ and the other worked in one of the shiny office blocks nearby. Everyone laughed\
  \ at my attempts to say \u2018thank you\u2019 in Vietnamese when the food was ready.\
  \ The crunchy onions and fresh green herbs were a taste explosion, and the slightly\
  \ chewy and greasy tapioca was fantastically flavoured by the hot and sweet sauce.\
  \ Before I could finish eating, the lady who worked in the office block  went to\
  \ the trouble of pointing out her building to me and told me to come by if I needed\
  \ anything while I was staying in the city. It also transpired that she\u2019d kindly\
  \ paid for my lunch too. \n\nI\u2019ve never been gladder to have turned my back\
  \ on air-conditioning. A country is its people. The stories of history are etched\
  \ in the faces of those you meet."
