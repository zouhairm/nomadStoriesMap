Text: "The panic came too late. I stood at the edge fifty meters high, my ankles tightly\
  \ bound, with no other option but to lean forward and fall. My heartbeat intensified\
  \ as my surroundings remained beautifully still. Clouds of cotton shared space with\
  \ the blue sky and emerald green rainforest that hugged my periphery. Straight ahead\
  \ was the deep blue Coral Sea and, somewhere below its surface, the Great Barrier\
  \ Reef. Yet my focus wasn\u2019t on the ocean in front of me, or the shelter of\
  \ the tall cedars and pepperwood behind me, but on the pool directly beneath me.\
  \ Dark with the tannins of the rainforest, my goal was to touch it. \n\nHad the\
  \ panic come sooner I could\u2019ve returned the way I came, barefoot down flights\
  \ of steps  weathered and warmed by the tropic sun of Far North Queensland. I knew\
  \ that way well. I\u2019d taken it many times before whenever that unknown fear\
  \ appeared. I\u2019d heed its warning and retreat before facing whatever stood in\
  \ front of me. \n\nEarlier that morning I woke with the knot in my chest. The knot\
  \ that made physical the anxieties of home that I\u2019d left behind. Halfway through\
  \ my first solo trip, the knot caught up with me. I drove north from Cairns along\
  \ Captain Cook Highway, wondering if I\u2019d make the jump. My wondering came with\
  \ good reason, I\u2019d already passed by once. Three days prior, this was supposed\
  \ to have been my first stop after landing. But as I came into the roundabout, I\
  \ ignored the exit and kept straight. It was getting late and I had to make it to\
  \ Port Douglas before dark. I\u2019m sure there were other excuses too. \t\n\nAs\
  \ the roundabout drew near the knot tightened in my chest; maybe I should stay straight.\
  \ I could keep to the highway as it rambled between the mountains and the sea. Asphalt,\
  \ palm trees, and the occasional lookout being the only things keeping me from the\
  \ water. Despite the salties and stingers lingering right off shore, this was the\
  \ safe option. I could remain on the ground and search for a safer adventure. \n\
  \nThis time I made the exit left and felt the knot tighten again. Hidden under a\
  \ blooming canopy I found my destination: AJ Hackett \u2013 the only bungy jump\
  \ in Australia. The steep path to the entrance was innocuous enough, except for\
  \ the signing warning of \u201Cfalling people.\u201D \n\nRather than register immediately,\
  \ I watched to see what I was getting myself into. Before me stood the tower: fifty\
  \ meters of ominous gray steel standing stagnant in the rainforest \u2013 as out\
  \ of its element as a human mid-air. But I relaxed some. Fifty meters didn\u2019\
  t look that tall. Suddenly a body launched itself from the ledge. I could do this.\
  \ \n\nAs I began my ascent a strange peace overtook me. Ben and Andy, the staff-members\
  \ responsible for ensuring our harnesses held tight, worked meticulously but kept\
  \ the mood light for everyone in the short queue. Both younger than me, they joked\
  \ in thick Aussie accents about Andy\u2019s date the night before.\n\nFinally it\
  \ was my turn. I sat on a wooden box as Ben bound my ankles before I hobbled to\
  \ the edge. I panicked. Fifty meters suddenly seemed much further from the ground.\
  \ \u201CThis is a terrible idea,\u201D I thought, no doubt audibly. As they counted\
  \ down, I took a deep breath and found my confidence. With my knees bent and arms\
  \ extended, I lunged forward. The knot in my chest was pulled into my stomach as\
  \ the sensation of free-falling overtook me. As I came within feet of the water\
  \ I felt the resistance catch. Relief rushed through my body as my fall slowed.\
  \ I touched the water right as I was pulled back up. I bobbed upside-down a few\
  \ times more as a raft came out to collect me. I laid on the hot raft and stared\
  \ into the sun as it beat down on me, relishing in a rush of adrenaline  and euphoria.\
  \ In the middle of a rainforest on the far side of the world, I experienced the\
  \ most incredible joy because I ignored the knot. It was time to jump again."
