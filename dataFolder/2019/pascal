Text: "- Pascal was about fifty-five when he came to Sri Lanka from France, - Andy\
  \ starts a new story. - He fell in love with the South coast. He got acquainted\
  \ with two local people, Kumar and his friend, they live there, near Paula, and\
  \ with their help he began buying beautiful land near the ocean. Well, you know,\
  \ this land on the slope near the temple, under palm trees? He was buying it by\
  \ pieces, some parts were registered with those Sri-Lankan guys, some - with him.\
  \ Kumar was such a very tricky type... I told Pascal many times to put his business\
  \ in order, because this chaos with documents would not lead to anything good. They\
  \ say, at some point, Pascal did write a document, something like \"I paid all the\
  \ money for this land, and despite the fact that the land is owned by two more people,\
  \ it belongs to me\". He took these guys to the notary, and everyone signed this\
  \ document.\nIn general, Andy talks very warmly of Pascal, an \u201Camazing man\u201D\
  . She says that when he came to the island, he was a UN employee and often went\
  \ to the hot spots of the world.\n- A week after signing of the document, Pascal\
  \ went to Libya for work, - Andy pauses, but I do not expect any tricks. - And died\
  \ there.\nWe all gasp, except for those who already know this story.\nDutch girl\
  \ Reiki is very impressible, she starts to emotionally gesticulate:\n- How? Why\
  \ did he die?\nAndy replies:\n- All internal organs failed. - She makes big eyes\
  \ and speaks in a muffled voice, leaning towards us, - I think he was poisoned.\n\
  Reiki is still impressed by the scale of the plot:\n- In Libya?!\n- Here.\n- Aah,\
  \ and then it materialized? - nods Reiki. She says exactly the word \u201Cmaterialized\u201D\
  .\n\u201CWell, yes,\u201D - it must be not Andy\u2019s first time to tell this story,\
  \ but she captures attention tightly with her intonations, incarnated Edgar Allan\
  \ Poe. Life in Sri Lanka taught Andy to speak slowly, with long pauses, so her British\
  \ pronunciation is understandable even to those who don't speak English very well:\n\
  - Wait, there\u2019s more.\nOur attention at this point could be cut with a knife.\n\
  - On the New Year's, some local gangsters attacked Kumar\u2019s tuk-tuk, there was\
  \ a fight. Then there are different versions, but the essence is the same - Kumar\
  \ was stabbed with a knife, and he died.\nReiki screams. I sit silently digesting.\n\
  A quiet amazing warm evening by the ocean, Andy\u2019s house is absolutely fabulous,\
  \ I have seen such interiors only in magazines about expensive houses and read about\
  \ them in books about Asia in the early 20th century. A wooden veranda with comfortable\
  \ wicker chairs, the evening air is mixed with the freshness of the ocean and the\
  \ delicate aroma of plumeria which is called \u201Cfrangipani\u201D here.\nThis\
  \ evening seem to materialize from my favorite book. The heat went along with the\
  \ sun beyond the horizon, Europeans from different countries and ages, all tanned\
  \ and unhurried, gathered for drinks before dinner. The waves murmur and the jungle\
  \ whispers in the darkness. \nAnd in this meditative evening a chilling story suddenly\
  \ breaks in.\nAndy continues:\n- So, they detained the murder suspects. They held\
  \ them for a while... and released! Imagine - released the killers!\n- What a story!\
  \ - Reiki already sees it in the form of a movie, she is a film director, as I see\
  \ it already as a novel.\n- Wait, it gets worse, - Andy enjoys our amazement. As\
  \ it turned out, neither of guests knew the continuation. - A friend of Kumar\u2019\
  s son killed one of Kumar\u2019s killers!\n- What?! - We all exhale at once.\n-\
  \ It\u2019s impossible to make this up, right?\nThat's for sure. And though I understand\
  \ that this side of life is everywhere, in any city and country - a real estate\
  \ scam, showdowns, gangsters, but it\u2019s so dissonant with my feelings here,\
  \ in Sri Lanka, as a tourist. \n- So, Pascal\u2019s sister has been trying to win\
  \ the right to own the land for three years now, she has to prove family ties, although\
  \ there are plenty of documents. And so far nothing has been decided, - Andy briefly\
  \ ends this thriller."
