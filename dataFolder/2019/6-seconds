Text: "Missiles and bomb shelters were not things I anticipated seeing or learning\
  \ about that day. We were taken to a kibbutz on the Gaza Strip. We stood on one\
  \ side of a fence and on the other side we could see fields and a town that were\
  \ in the Gaza Strip. Everything we had heard about became so real. You can comfortably\
  \ hear about a conflict safely from your home in America, but your whole perspective\
  \ changes when you see it happening with your own eyes. We met a man who has lived\
  \ there his whole life. He showed us around, and for the most part, it looked like\
  \ a normal little town. As we kept talking to him, we learned that it wasn\u2019\
  t as normal as we thought. We discovered that all of the brightly painted bus stops\
  \ doubled as bomb shelters. We learned that most of the houses have at least one\
  \ or two walls that were strong enough to protect against incoming missiles. Everyone\
  \ there knew where safety could be found regardless of where they were. Once the\
  \ sirens go off, everyone only has about six seconds before the missile hits. Six\
  \ seconds to make sure you \u2013 and any other humans \u2013 are safe. \n\n\tOne\
  \ thing that struck me was the schools. All the schools double as bomb shelters.\
  \ Imagine being a teacher there- could you imagine being responsible for a whole\
  \ class and their safety? What if you were doing an activity outside and it went\
  \ off? As a preschool teacher, my mind automatically goes to the younger children\
  \ \u2013 the ones who might not fully understand what is happening or what they\
  \ need to do. Imagine being a preschool teacher when those alarms go off. Six seconds\
  \ to corral all the children to safety. They said that they train the children to\
  \ run to safety when they hear the sirens and try to turn it into a game \u2013\
  \ but what if they freeze out of fear, or a child is being stubborn? Even the playgrounds\
  \ have bomb shelters imbedded in them. One that we saw had a caterpillar that was\
  \ long and was a tunnel. From a third party standpoint it just looked like play\
  \ equipment, but it\u2019s purpose was so much more than that. The man had us imagine\
  \ if we were here with our kids and we had friends there with their kids and the\
  \ siren went off. We would have six seconds to not only get our kids to the tunnel,\
  \ but often even adults will freeze, so then you\u2019d have to make sure your friend\
  \ and her kids also got to safety. So much to think about and do in those six seconds.\n\
  \nI left there with a whole new mindset and a heavy heart for those people. A constant\
  \ threat, that is so foreign to us, is simply the way they do life."
