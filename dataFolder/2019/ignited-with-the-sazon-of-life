Text: "Celebrate the beauty of being alive. By absolute magic we have been given the\
  \ opportunity to have this human experience. Rocks collided in space and got pressurized\
  \ so they broke apart. And galaxies happened. And earth was created where water\
  \ supported life. So let\u2019s enjoy it while we can.\n\nPeople in Colombia realize\
  \ this and take it to the full extent. Vibrant street art, music blasting from every\
  \ tienda, and salsa dancing that could break out at any moment. Tropical fruits,\
  \ rich foods, and welcoming people. Living simply and gratefully, embracing the\
  \ joy of every moment. The beauty of community. Bold lipstick, palms swaying in\
  \ the breeze and strong little coffees. Smoothie stands, donkeys walking in the\
  \ streets, and people carrying portable grills with chorizo. You can hear three\
  \ different beats at any given moment; reggaeton, salsa, merengue, etc. Time is\
  \ slower near the sea. People are here in this present moment, totally tranquil,\
  \ and joyfully greeting one another in the city square.\n\nSanta Marta, Colombia.\
  \ One of the most animated places I have ever seen. You can\u2019t help but come\
  \ out of your shell when your environment is bursting with life. In fact I was encouraged\
  \ to flourish into my most fearless form. Riding out on a motorbike through the\
  \ curving jungle roads, passing over rivers with wild caimans and tropical birds.\
  \ We stopped and stepped out onto a dramatic cliff. The grass was like a lush green\
  \ carpet between my toes. We walked to the edge and looked down at the vast expanse\
  \ of beach. The immense ocean crashed and pulled the sand down with force. La brisa\
  \ loca (the crazy breeze) howled and drove the ocean wild, the waves crashing even\
  \ more powerfully. A feeling of vastness that just swallows you whole. Any photo\
  \ does a laughable job to capture the immensity with any justice. When we feel our\
  \ egos vanish and realize we are tiny and coincidental in the grand scheme of the\
  \ universe. Liberated from fear and full of aspiration. Present in the rhythm of\
  \ our heart, pumped by wild ambition. We live to experience this vastness. I felt\
  \ refreshed, revived, and alive. Vibrant and bold. Savoring the salty breeze twirling\
  \ my hair around. \n\nAnd then I returned to the harsh winter of Worcester, Massachusetts.\
  \ Your small town starts to feel even smaller when you get a taste of the vastness\
  \ of the world. And you try to fit yourself back into your life but your soul is\
  \ overflowing with the sentiments of the culture that felt like home. And you don\u2019\
  t belong anymore.\n\nYou\u2019ve discovered new corners of the world, and even though\
  \ you had nothing but a backpack it felt more comfortable than your nest here. Because\
  \ your heart now beats on another frequency, and you try to find your old rhythm\
  \ but the song is overplayed.\nYou are confined in the responsibilities of time\
  \ and money, and you search for a way out. And on your quest the vibe encroaches\
  \ and suffocates, exhausting you and draining your inspiration.\n\nThe photos bring\
  \ a bitter joy, a warm nostalgia that cuts like a knife when your reality now is\
  \ such a sharp contrast. You caught it, the travel bug; the infection spreads through\
  \ your veins to your extremities, and the pain pulsates with each fantasy about\
  \ adventure.\n\nSo you take the discomfort and channel it into creation. The birth\
  \ of creativity, the death of old habits. Desolation of the life leading to creation\
  \ from the mind. And it\u2019s all ups and downs and internalization and suffering.\
  \ And passion and exploration and love. It\u2019s the all encompassing and ever-enriching\
  \ life we love and hate.\n\nTime ticks on with the universe only knowing the grand\
  \ scheme, and we can only ever hope for peace within ourselves and guidance towards\
  \ our healthiest environment."
