Text: "I was in my home,without money, lying on the floor steering on the ceiling.\n\
  My imagination was far away from home. In fact i was thinking the i was sitting\
  \ on the send of the beach. I was so connected that I could even hear the noise\
  \ of the sea, crazy hum, hahaha. So my  mother opened the door...\n- phone for you\
  \ - she said\nSo i pick up the phone,was my sister, inviting me to go traveling\
  \ to the beach with her husband and some family friends. \nThe good news,were the\
  \ everything was already paid. Hahahah\nwhat a coincidence and luck I thought..\n\
  happily i accepted the invitation, in the next day , there we are on the road to\
  \ the beach.\nWas five hours of good music and conversations inside a small car.\
  \ Full of good sneaks.\nI was in the window side of the car,  the wind seems to\
  \ dance in my hair until we got to the beach house. \nFinally  we get there.\nWe\
  \ all settled up, and the next thing i remember, was sitting on the send of the\
  \ beach,looking to the ocean. \nPleasant wind, nice people, beautiful views.  So\
  \ , i thought with my self for a momento;\n- ow this is so real like when i was\
  \  imagining lying on the floor of my house.At that moment i felt like i achieved\
  \ something just imagining. Although i have to confess,i don't really believed in\
  \ the power of mind. But the fact is,i think the i was deep wishing be on the beach.\
  \ So that truly wish  become real.  the fact is, i really don't need to understand\
  \ how and why happening. So back to the storie.\nAfter the nice day on the beach,\
  \ my sister want to see the sun rise in the morning.\nEverybody was tired, because\
  \ we hang out in the night, at the fairs that are selling handicrafts, food and\
  \ various cool things at night. We walk,talk, eat, was very fun. \nAt that night\
  \ i sleep like a baby,until i walk up 4 in the morning,with slap on my face. Yes\
  \ , my sister was trying to wake me up, to see the sun rise with her. Hahaha. I\
  \ get up, and wet my face, brushed my teeth, bit a bread, and walked out to the\
  \ beach with my sister and brother-in-law. \nI was really tired. But when i was\
  \ approaching to the Beach, the sound of the sea and wind, woke me up Suddenly.\
  \ \nAnd there is , the most beautiful sun i ever seeing. Was really magical you\
  \ know. If you never saw the sun rise on the beach, i truly recommend you do. \n\
  I thought, ayaa was Worth the slaps on my face hahaha.\nWe walk and admired the\
  \ sun, so after he rise, we get back to the house , because we planned to visit\
  \ the others beaches around. Everybody get into the car, and get on the road. Music\
  \ again, and a lot photos, my sister love take photos hahaha. \nAt that moment we\
  \ are in the city of Ubatuba of the state Sao Paulo. \nThe next beach was about\
  \ one hour.\nBut the weather was good, and we decided see others beaches too. Was\
  \ like we stopped at a beach, enjoyed it for about 20 minutes and went to another.\
  \ Was fun , and we get crazy, that we decided go to the Rio de Janeiro. At car haha,\
  \ but the crazy idea was worth, because we saw beautiful beachs, and walk into a\
  \ historic old city, call Paraty - Rio de janeiro. \nFor real, the trip was really\
  \ unexpected in all the ways.We enjoyed all day, in the road, on the beaches, in\
  \ the historic city, was so fun and fully of adventure. \nAt the and of the day,\
  \ we get back to the house, and talk and laugh, cook, and enjoy. \nwe stayed for\
  \ 5 days at the beach house. On the fifth day, to return home, we caught a huge\
  \ traffic. but it was so fun. that even the transit was worth it, the sky was very\
  \ starry and we sang in the car.\nFinally we got home all tanned. \nI layed in my\
  \ bed and thanked for the trip."
