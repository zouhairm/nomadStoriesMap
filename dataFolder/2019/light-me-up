Text: "\u201CAndersen! Welcome to the homeland!\u201D The passport agent bellowed\
  \ at me with a crooked grin. I\u2019d done it. I\u2019d traveled to Europe on my\
  \ own, about to embark on a two week journey across the continent. First stop: Copenhagen.\n\
  \nI found my air bnb with ease, as I\u2019d been studying the directions for a month.\
  \ The smell of a new country distracted me from the uphill one mile walk to the\
  \ home. \n\nMy host, a dainty Danish woman, greeted me at the door with melon and\
  \ chocolate croissants. Her house was something out of an old fairy tale and the\
  \ inside was filled with treasures you\u2019d only find at garage sales. \n\nI needed\
  \ to sleep, as I hadn\u2019t since I left America. She showed me my room and shower,\
  \ and everything that I needed, and I was out. My excitement and lack of sleep made\
  \ the perfect nightcap.\n\nBAM BAM. I awoke, startled, to someone banging on my\
  \ door. Then I realized my phone was blaring from my alarm that went off an hour\
  \ ago. I managed to mumble something about being sorry for the noise. No answer.\
  \ \n\nSomething wasn\u2019t right. I had a feeling like an anvil was on my chest\
  \ and butterflies in my stomach. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s just waking up somewhere\
  \ new. A shower would help. \n\nI\u2019m running my fingers through the lavender\
  \ suds in my hair when suddenly I realize... this is the last time I\u2019m going\
  \ to be washing my hair. I\u2019m going to die today. I don\u2019t know how, or\
  \ when, or why. But it\u2019s inevitable. I can feel it all the way in my bones.\
  \ I\u2019m going to die today.\n\nI look around knowing this is the last time I\u2019\
  ll be in a shower. I grab the grapefruit body wash. All the ingredients are in Danish.\
  \ Great. I can\u2019t even read about what I\u2019m doing to my body on the last\
  \ day I\u2019m alive. Am I allergic to grapefruit? I can\u2019t remember. \n\nI\
  \ wipe off the fogged mirror. There\u2019s a crack all the way down the middle and\
  \ I imagine that crack in my face instead. Maybe I\u2019ll slip and crack my head\
  \ open today. I study my face... the freckles I\u2019ve never liked, my short eyelashes,\
  \ my emerald eyes. This is what I\u2019ll look like on the last day of my life.\n\
  \nI decide to still go out. I can\u2019t stand the idea of dying in an air bnb next\
  \ to a plate of half eaten chocolate croissants. The mile back to the train seems\
  \ longer now. I notice a dog tied up in a yard outside... will he kill me? I cross\
  \ two sets of train tracks on the way... will that be the way I go?\n\nI stop in\
  \ a convenience store for a water and as I\u2019m paying, I notice cigarettes next\
  \ to the register. I\u2019d never smoked before, but why not? My health wasn\u2019\
  t going to last much longer anyway. I asked for \u201Cthe best cigarettes you have\u201D\
  , he handed me American Spirits and a green lighter with \u201CCOPENHAGEN\u201D\
  \ etched across the middle.\n\nI stepped outside, anxious for my first cigarette,\
  \ when a tall man with floppy black hair approached me and asked to bum one. He\
  \ was handsome in that not having to try hard way. I glanced at his lips. Full and\
  \ chapped. Would these be the last lips to kiss me? \n\nI handed him one and watched\
  \ him light up. I followed suit and took my first drag, totally expecting to drop\
  \ dead right there. At the very least, I expected to cough or puke or something.\
  \ But I didn\u2019t. It was perfect. The perfect drag. Maybe because I had no expectations.\
  \ Maybe because I knew it couldn\u2019t kill me. I was already dead. \n\n\u201C\
  Something wrong?\u201D \n\n\u201CI\u2019ve just never smoked before.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Why now?\u201D\n\n\u201CI think I\u2019m going to die today.\u201D The words flew\
  \ out of my mouth before I could grab them. They floated into the air and I realized\
  \ just how crazy they sounded. \n\nI looked up, expecting him to laugh at me.\n\n\
  \u201CEveryone should live as if they think they\u2019re going to die today. You\u2019\
  re lucky.\u201D\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m allergic to grapefruit."
