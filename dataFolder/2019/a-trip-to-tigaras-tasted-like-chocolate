Text: "Would the trip be bored ? That was a question on my mind when I, my friends,\
  \ and a lecturer decided to go to Tigaras village. I thought it would not be exciting\
  \ as I realized we were not on a vacation. Eventually, the question became the sweetest\
  \ \nexperience like chocolate, because there were unexpected things that I had in\
  \ the village.\n\nI got the trip in 2002, when I was still being a Social Anthropology\
  \ student in Universitas Sumatera Utara, Medan. Medan is in province of North Sumatera,\
  \ in Indonesia. The trip was aimed to fulfill one of the requirements to make a\
  \ thesis. All of us chose Tigaras for ours because one of the students has relatives\
  \ in the village, hence we did not have to spend any money to rent a lodgment. We\
  \ just spent four days there. His relatives allowed us to use a warehouse which\
  \ was used to store carp food. \n\nTigaras village is one of the smallest villages\
  \ in North Sumatera, and the village is on the edge of Lake Toba. It is located\
  \ at sub disrict which is called Dolok Pardamean, and Dolok Pardamean is located\
  \ at Regency of Simalungun. To reach Tigaras, there are no public transportations\
  \ from Medan which will deliver tourists directly to the village, except they rent\
  \ a car. Tourists must get transit first to Pematangsiantar town before they reach\
  \ to Tigaras, and to get the town, they need to use a public transportation to pick\
  \ them up to the bus station. Medan has many of bus stations, but there is only\
  \ one integrated bus station, which is called Amplas Bus Station. \n\nA trip to\
  \ Tigaras tasted like chocolate, even as a matter of fact, I can feel the sweetness\
  \ until now. When getting the trip, it was like releasing burdens from my shoulder\
  \ because of campus activities. My eyes was like pampered by the scenery of Tigaras.\
  \ There were hills and highland area with green grassland. Both Lake Toba and the\
  \ villager houses could be seen from the highland area, even I could see Lake Toba\
  \ from the outside of the warehouse where we stayed. Eventhough the houses were\
  \ shaped irregularly, they were still beautiful to be seen.\n\nTigaras has its uniqueness.\
  \ People can go to Samosir Island by using a boat from Tigaras. It would take around\
  \ half an hour by boat, and I knew it after arriving in Tigaras. Unfortunately,\
  \ I could not go to Samosir Island at that time, because all of us were busy to\
  \ make a small research, but I could still enjoy the nature when I and my friends\
  \ made a small research as our intention in Tigaras. We went around the village,\
  \ and all of sudden, I found a tomato garden. I never saw a tomato garden for whole\
  \ my life until I saw it in Tigaras. Some tomatoes were red, and rest of them were\
  \ still green. I saw a few of red tomatoes had fallen on the ground. I would really\
  \ like to take some of the fallen tomatoes, but I remembered that I was not a thief,\
  \ hence I did not do that. I still noticed them for a few minutes, because they\
  \ looked adorable, and then I continued to go around to the village with my friends.\
  \ When we were walking around the village, I felt like gaining a spiritual treatment\
  \ from nature for my soul. What unexpected moments !\n\nFurthermore, the most surprising\
  \ thing in Tigaras was I was able to eat my favourite fish as many as I could. It\
  \ was carp. Carp is the most famous fish in Tigaras and it is a type of fish which\
  \ is widely cultivated in the village. The local youths made farewell party for\
  \ us, and we did not have to pay carp. They provided and cooked it for us in the\
  \ farewell party. \n\nAll the unexpected things in Tigaras, made me realized that\
  \ I need to be grateful person, since God still gave me happiness through them.\
  \ It was such a lesson that I was not supposed to be a negative-minded person before\
  \ doing a task, and of course, I keep remembering the lesson till now."
