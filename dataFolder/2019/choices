Text: "The dirt under my feet is wet and slippery from the multitude of soaking wet\
  \ children who have been up here before me. Curling my toes into the mud I have\
  \ a look over the edge and see the muddied river water below. No chance of seeing\
  \ any hidden rocks under the murky water which means a lot more risk from a jump\
  \ like this. The cliff is a solid seven or eight metres high; I am two metres tall.\
  \ The kids I\u2019d been teaching encourage me to jump but fail to understand my\
  \ fear of shattered bone on rock, should I misjudge my landing.\n\nFrom where I\u2019\
  m standing, I can see over the thick plantations of trees back up across the hillside\
  \ to the orphanage where I have been spending my time for some three weeks now.\
  \ The newly painted red and yellow fence projects itself in stark contrast to the\
  \ surrounding greenery.\nSankhlaburi in Western Thailand near the Burmese border\
  \ is well off the beaten track, eight hours north-west of Bangkok means there is\
  \ minimal tourist traffic and the town is more culture rich and traditional than\
  \ other parts of the country as a result. \n\n\nI\u2019ve spent three weeks here\
  \ and have two more to go, working with local orphans teaching them basic English,\
  \ taking the time to play sports and games with them as well as leading nature hikes\
  \ through the nearby hills and to the local river where I now find myself.\nAlong\
  \ the way I\u2019ve fallen in love with everything about Thailand, Sankhlaburi in\
  \ particular. The people here took me in as one of their own and every day has been\
  \ a new enriching discovery. New people to meet, food to eat, and nature to explore.\
  \ From the noise of the fruit and vegetable sellers and smells of freshly cooked\
  \ local produce at the morning markets, to the swim across the large town lake to\
  \ play football with the locals, to the kids who live in the orphanage and the everyday\
  \ heroes who act as their de-facto parents, guardians and teachers all in one.\n\
  \nAs a fresh-faced eighteen-year-old, there wasn\u2019t much I\u2019d really thought\
  \ about committing myself to in life, all I knew was that travelling was what I\
  \ loved to do and this trip was my leaping-off point into the rest of my life, both\
  \ as an adult and as a traveller. \nThis is the thought in my mind staring at the\
  \ valley in front of me, the impending jump momentarily forgotten. If I concentrate,\
  \ the noise of shrieking children fades and I find myself poised, drinking in the\
  \ humidity-soaked atmosphere and admiring the rolling hills stretching to the horizon.\
  \ In this moment the possibilities of life stretch away in front of me in my mind\
  \ and I realise that jumping from this cliff is not just a spur of the moment act\
  \ but a conscious culmination of a far bigger decision I hadn\u2019t even realised\
  \ I had made to myself many months, maybe years, earlier. This world is a big and\
  \ often harsh and unforgiving place but as humans we should endeavour to explore\
  \ and to learn, as these are the ways in which we teach ourselves to become more\
  \ kind, caring and generous people and to improve the world around us.\nSo to the\
  \ sound of these new friends and with the beautiful surrounds of remote western\
  \ Thailand as my backdrop I breathe in deeply and leap forward, committing myself\
  \ not only to the unknown beneath me but also to an unknown future of travel, adventure\
  \ and the pursuit of learning to make both myself and the world around me better\
  \ for all those in it.\n\nHere\u2019s to a good landing."
