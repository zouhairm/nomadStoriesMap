Text: "Travelling has never been my forte nor was I much enthusiastic about it. For\
  \ me, travelling was always going out to nearby places with family or friends for\
  \ a day or two. But, life wills its way and soon enough depression hit me hard.\
  \ There was no particular reason for me to suffer from depression but yet I had\
  \ it. After, months of treatment and not even one ounce of improvement, my psychologist\
  \ friend suggested a solo trip. I laughed off the suggestion but Adarsh was quite\
  \ adamant and I gave in to him finally. I decided on Darjeeling, a small hill station\
  \ nestling in the laps of the Himalayan mountain ranges on the extreme northern\
  \ side of West Bengal. For me, going on a solo trip and travelling was no less than\
  \ a little leap of faith. \nAs the train chugged out of the station slowly, I could\
  \ feel the cold yet pleasant air on my cheeks. My little journey began on September\
  \ 9th, 2017 and I was already dreading about how to pass the rest of the 3 days.\
  \ Even at that time, all that I wanted was to reach my hotel and go to sleep. But,\
  \ going up the serpentine mountain roads, for the first time I noticed the unmasked\
  \ beauty of nature. Small and big trees grew up by the side of the gorge and the\
  \ tree-tops waved merrily to me as the sunshine glistened off on the leaves. As\
  \ I gazed on, the setting sun rays decided to give me a colourful performance of\
  \ vibrant colours dancing on the niches of every turn I took. I asked Mehmet, who\
  \ was driving me up to the hotel to stop the car for a while. He looked at me with\
  \ a smile and said, \" Sister, you have found your cure.\" His words struck me a\
  \ bit odd and I merely nodded at him out of politeness. \nMehmet stopped the car\
  \ at a serene spot. I sprang out of the car without my mobile or a camera bewitched\
  \ by the playfulness of nature. A small waterfall made a happy hissing sound as\
  \ the water flowed down the gorge into the big Teesta river gurgling down. As I\
  \ looked at the river, I remembered the famous line by Alfred Lord Tennyson, \"\
  Men may come and men may go, But I go on forever\". I was surprised at myself that\
  \ I could remember the poem from my childhood. The chirping of the birds finding\
  \ their way back to the nest looked like little dots on the orange sky. I looked\
  \ as far as I could and saw the grey hills melting into the arms of lush greenery\
  \ shrouded by the vast orange sky. The gushes of fresh air somehow gave me a new\
  \ lease on life. Tracing the mighty Himalayan ranges in the distance with my eyes,\
  \ I felt the power of love that travelling entrusts the soul with. \nMehmet, who\
  \ was watching me from afar came and stood beside me, smiling merrily as always.\
  \ I was thankful for his silence and his company. I realised that the wanderlust\
  \ embedded deep in our soul could only be realised when we take that one step forward\
  \ towards travelling. The white space that was lacking in me was now filled with\
  \ the bright quest that took me to a new place where nature revealed herself at\
  \ her best gifting me some breathtaking scenes, to be etched on my mind and in my\
  \ heart forever. No two travel stories are similar and mine is a travel story that\
  \ helped me unravel myself. I found my cure and I found my passion. A leap into\
  \ the unknown made me realise the true meaning of \"home is where the heart is\"\
  \ and I have found my home in the lanes and bylanes around the world for my heart\
  \ is off on an eloquent odyssey, busy exploring and collecting memories from the\
  \ innumerable corners of the world. I happily understand the true meaning behind\
  \ Mehmet's encouraging words today."
