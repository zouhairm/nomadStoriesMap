Text: "This novel would a a memoir to my Opa, my grandfather. He was a tortured soul,\
  \ an alcoholic, police officer, ship engineer, artist, poet, writer, and gang member.\
  \ He was the only white man to be allowed to sit on the steps, to date. He killed\
  \ two people and was on death row for 17 days. This novel will start from the birth\
  \ of my uncle, Leon and tell the story of my grandfather from the perspectives of\
  \ his children and his wife. It will honour her death and the last chapter will\
  \ be from the perspective of  Joseph Du Toit himself. \nIt will be a story of creativity,\
  \ loss, drug abuse, art, poverty and will show all perspectives of those involved.\
  \ I have been told I am a lot like my grandfather - being a poet, writer, artist\
  \ and musician. This is to pay tribute to his life in a honest and authentic way.\n\
  \nI was created to write this novel, his blood runs through my veins, I carry his\
  \ genes, I was birthed by his daughter and not writing this memoir, is not an option.\
  \ I often feel like a jig-saw puzzle with a piece missing - the missing piece is\
  \ my grandfather's story. I am a  girl who has actual streams in my body instead\
  \ of bloodstreams, forests instead of hair, oceans instead of eyes, fire instead\
  \ of a heart and vineyards instead of hands, grapes instead of eyes. To write this\
  \ is my personal legend I must follow. As Paulo Coelho wrote \"when you want something,\
  \ all the universe conspires in helping you achieve it\". This is the only thing\
  \ I want. I am Portuguese, so to do this would be to return to my roots, my beginning\
  \ and build something that I cannot deny. My heart pulls me back to my home and\
  \ I have never wanted some thing more, than this scholarship."
