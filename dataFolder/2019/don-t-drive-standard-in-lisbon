Text: "The first time I ever visited Lisbon was uneventful to say the least. After\
  \ waiting for three hours on the Tarmac in Toronto due to weather conditions, my\
  \ family and I somehow found ourselves stalled another two hours in line at Portuguese\
  \ customs because of the employee strike.By the time dad finally stopped arguing\
  \ with the rent-a-car woman, the five of us piled into a four seater clown car and\
  \ rested the suitcases that couldn\u2019t fit in the trunk onto our laps. Little\
  \ did any of us know that this was dad\u2019s first timing driving standard. Ever.\n\
  \nI was falling asleep before my two sisters and mom did, but every time I batted\
  \ an eye I saw one of their heads start to bob. I was nearly fully asleep until\
  \ my forehead suddenly smashed against the driver seat head rest and I jolted awake.\n\
  \n\u201CCome on!\u201D Dad yelled. There was a lineup of cars in front of us that\
  \ curved around a bend at the top of a hill. We happened to be stopped on a narrow\
  \ one-way street that must have been on at least a 60 degree slope. On my left there\
  \ was a small cafe with round wicker tables set up with the chairs facing outward.\
  \ As the cars in front of us began moving, a loud roar sounded from the engine and\
  \ dad started jerking the stick-shift up and down. It must have been a minute and\
  \ a half before the cars behind us started honking. The cafe patrons were laughing\
  \ and pointing at us.\n\nA knock on dad\u2019s window made us all jump out of our\
  \ seats. A lanky boy with shaggy hair, braces and teenage acne was standing over\
  \ dad. He was dressed in a cafe uniform with an apron around his waist. Dad rolled\
  \ down the window. First the boy pointed to himself, then to the steering wheel.\
  \ Dad looked at mom. Mom pushed dad out of the car and said, \u201Cwell you can\u2019\
  t do it.\u201D\n\nWithin seconds, this kid had plopped himself into the driver seat\
  \ and with one suave hand motion, got the engine revving in full swing. Before I\
  \ knew it, dad was left in the dust and we were approaching the top of the hill.\
  \ We could still hear the applause coming from the cafe patrons as we turned the\
  \ corner.\n\nMom pointed out the window at a tall building and said \u201CThat\u2019\
  s our hotel.\u201D Without speaking a word, the kid looked out the window and nodded.\
  \ Suddenly, the car came to a screeching halt as the kid pulled up to a police barricade\
  \ blocking the entrance to the hotel. A policeman yelled something in Portuguese\
  \ and made a hand-motion that could easily be deduced as \u201Cturn around.\u201D\
  \ The kid yelled something back at him, but the cop kept shaking his head. The kid\
  \ grunted and believe it or not, he reversed out of there and continued back up\
  \ the hill.\n\nIf Lisbon hadn\u2019t all been one-way streets, I would have thought\
  \ this kid was trying to kidnap us. We just kept getting farther and farther away\
  \ from the hotel. To break the silence mom started asking questions, \n\u201CHow\
  \ old are you?\u201D she asked. \n\u201CNo English.\u201D the kid replied. \n\u201C\
  What\u2019s your name?\u201D she asked.\n\u201CNo English.\u201D the kid repeated.\n\
  \u201CAre you kidnapping us?!\u201D My sister shouted.\n\u201CSorry. No English.\u201D\
  \ The kid said again.\n\nThere was a moment of silence. Then mom giggled. My sisters\
  \ and I started giggling too. Suddenly the whole car was laughing deep belly laughs.\
  \ Even the kid was chuckling.\n\nAs time passed the kid starting pointing things\
  \ out like \u201CCastelo de S. Jorge\u201D and \u201CPante\xE3o Nacional.\u201D\
  \ It wasn\u2019t till we looped around the Marques De Pombal that I realized my\
  \ eyes were glued to the window. I was more awake than ever before. I found myself\
  \ staring at the beautiful parks and museums. The locals were at the cafes and the\
  \ tourists were shopping. The children were playing and the students were studying.\
  \ It was the most magnificent city I had ever seen and I hadn\u2019t even stepped\
  \ foot out of that god-forsaken car."
