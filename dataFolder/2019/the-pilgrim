Text: "I once saw a man in Mecca who I could never forget.\n\nIt was during the Tawaf,\
  \ the sacred ritual that constitutes of a pilgrim walking seven rounds around the\
  \ Ka\u2019aba. I was a young man then, and I was with my family on our Hajj. I noticed\
  \ the man because he moved slower that all the rest of the pilgrims, and he pointed\
  \ at the Al Hajar Al Aswad, the Black Stone, for the longest time on each of his\
  \ rounds.\n\nI did not know when he began his Tawaf, but the end of mine, I noticed\
  \ him through the throngs of worshippers, still pointing towards the sacred stone.\
  \ On each of my seven rounds, I saw the man there in his ihram, its whiteness tainted\
  \ by the sands.\n\nI left the man and his solitude when my aged grandmother had\
  \ finished her Tawaf. But I saw him again when we were doing the Sa\u2019i. Between\
  \ the hills of Safa and Marwah, I met this man who had so captivated me earlier\
  \ in the day. Our eyes met, and although my lips were parched from not having drank\
  \ enough water, I asked him why he stood there for so long.\n\nHe smiled through\
  \ the weariness that was showing in his eyes.\n\n\u201CThe world moves on even if\
  \ I stay still. Even as I remember my faith, I know that others will have moved\
  \ on. It matters not how fast, or how slow I go, because ultimately, life is not\
  \ a race.\u201D\n\nAs he speaks with much genteel, his eyes soften, as if still\
  \ fixated onto the stone.\n \n\u201CWe do not seek the end, in fact, we spend a\
  \ lifetime trying to avoid it. The faces around me change each time I turn away\
  \ from the stone, just as they do if I were to still my life. I do this to remind\
  \ myself of this.\u201D\n\nI shook his hand and wished him peace on his journey.\
  \ \n\n\u201CAssalamualaikum.\u201D\n\nI stood behind, taking it all in. The moment,\
  \ the place, a mecca for all pilgrims mining for meaning. A sense of stillness overcomes\
  \ me, as if in prayer, as if in peace.\n \nThe man stops in his stride. He turns\
  \ slightly to face me. A pilgrim himself, he senses it too. He knows it all too\
  \ well."
