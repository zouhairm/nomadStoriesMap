  Your mother fighter cancer and your sister had a kidney transplant operation?\n\
  All this happens to me one day in Russia.\nAnd ... I just decided to prove myself\
  \ that Earth is a good place. Where magic and kindness can happen.\nAnd... I took\
  \ a one -way ticket to Canada.\nOh, I would love to share the story about 30 yeas\
  \ old woman who started life from the beginning.\nI didn\u2019t expect that I\u2019\
  ll meet Doukhobors ( do you know about them?), that I\u2019ll become a tour-guide\
  \ for millioners and will open my own eco-travel global company.\nI love Canada\
  \ and want to share my story about one - girl immigration.\nBut during last year\
  \ 52 others countries happens:\n- I sold my wedding ring to go to Hawaii \n- I celebrated\
  \ my 33 years old birthday in Brazil\n- I did a healing practice in Azores\n- I\
  \ did a lot of crying around Istanbul \n\nMy English still not perfect, as so my\
  \ life\nBut my story is full of adventures and wisdom, that can support anyone in\
  \ the world with the sense of adventures and love.\nOur planet is beautiful.\nWe\
  \ are so connected.\nSometimes life is tough. Really tough.\nBut it\u2019s still\
  \ a journey that worth to take!\nSincerely, Alla. \nSee you in Portugal !)"
