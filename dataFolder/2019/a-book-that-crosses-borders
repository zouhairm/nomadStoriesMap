Text: "\"The water and the wild\": this is the title of a book that connects me to\
  \ one of my friends. While she was here in Candeias, Bahia, Brazil, reading a history\
  \ that refers to the book I quoted, I was at the Denver Museum of Nature & Science,\
  \ in Denver, Colorado, USA, buying exactly the same book, that I had never heard\
  \ of before. And the most surprising: one was unaware of the other's experience\
  \ about the book. \n\nThe book mainly talks, and coincidentally, about two things\
  \ I was going through: a time of recovery and a journey. My journey began with a\
  \ group of students from my school who have conquered the trip to Colorado, a place\
  \ never seen before by us and imagined as the perfect place. There we learned about\
  \ how to be a global leadership in four steps: investigating the world, recognizing\
  \ different perspectives, communicating effectively and taking actions.\n\nIn \"\
  The water and the wild\" history there is a magical world, where differences exist\
  \ side by side: poverty and wealth. So I realized that if even a magical place is\
  \ not perfect, imagine the real world! The United States began to remind me of Brazil.\
  \ But, at the same time, it was so different. It was wonderful to experience a new\
  \ culture, to see snow for the first time, to meet my host family and to get to\
  \ know so many people that changed my life. I was investigating (part of) the world.\n\
  \nOn one of the nights of the trip, we went to a stadium to watch an ice hockey\
  \ game. The town was very cold. I left home wearing thermal clothes, leggings, jeans,\
  \ two sweaters, a thin coat, a heavy coat, gloves, scarves, cap, two pairs of socks,\
  \ a warm boot and even though it was still cold! Just crossing two streets, between\
  \ the parking lot and the stadium, made my whole body shake and I felt my hands,\
  \ feet and mouth numb. On the way, I saw the homeless people. But, wait, the homeless\
  \ were only from Brazil, right? No! I faced poverty in the place that I believed\
  \ there was no poverty. And they were not wearing half of the clothes I was! Problems\
  \ are all around the world.\n\nI started observing things around. Before, when walking\
  \ through the city, I looked at the large buildings, the Christmas decorations...\
  \ Then, I began to observe the houses that had little protection from the cold,\
  \ which were not very secure, which were covered by snow, making it impossible for\
  \ their residents from going out on the street. I changed my vision: every place\
  \ can get better. I was recognizing differents perspectives. Sometimes, depending\
  \ on the point of view where two people see a notebook, they will describe what\
  \ they see in different ways.\n\nI decided to talk about it with american and brazilian\
  \ people, from the youngest to the oldest. We visited the YMCA of the Rockies resort\
  \ in Estes Park, Colorado, and the two days we had there were essential to discuss\
  \ these issues and have a effective communication. It did not matter if I was in\
  \ the United States and my friend was in Brazil, the world as a whole needs all\
  \ of us. The world needs people who reads, take actions and record materials (written\
  \ or not) that pass from generation to generation.\n\nEven Brazil can get better,\
  \ if we take actions. I brought several good experiences that I had in the United\
  \ States. In the house I stayed, people don't use cellphone, for example, all the\
  \ day. They like getting together with family, talking about news, playing games...\
  \ A day off there is really a day to stay together and relax. And the examples go\
  \ beyond: I learned that instead of trying to change people, we can adapt the situation\
  \ to better comfort of both. As in the history of the book, life is a constant adventure\
  \ to save our precious things: the world and humanity. I am constantly learning\
  \ to be a global leadership."
