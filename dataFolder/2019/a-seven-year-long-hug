Text: "My mother hugged me goodbye in front of the security check at Arlanda Airport\
  \ in Stockholm. The year was 2011 and I was 16 years old, I didn't want my mom to\
  \ let me go but yet I hurried to go through the security check mainly because I\
  \ didn't want to risk having second thought and also because I was excited. \nA\
  \ few hours later I had arrived at Frankfurt Airport and was nervously waiting for\
  \ my two suitcases to show at the luggage claim, the two suitcases that contained\
  \ what would be all of my belongings for some time being. I didn't know when I would\
  \ go back to Sweden again or how I would get along without my family. The reason\
  \ for me moving to Germany all by myself at the age of 16 is because I was the third\
  \ generation in my family learning how to make prosthetic eyes out of glass, it\
  \ is a six year long apprenticeship at the company where my grandfather had learned\
  \ the occupation. My grandfather fell in love with a patient he had from Sweden\
  \ whom he later married and moved to Sweden for, where he started his company and\
  \ later had my father with the patient which later would be my grandmother. So it\
  \ has come full circle. I was back to where it all started. \n\nMy boss was waiting\
  \ for me at the airport,  we drove to Wiesbaden ,which is approximately 30 minutes\
  \ by car outside of Frankfurt, in silence. My German was at the time none existent\
  \ but luckily my boss was half Swedish so he spoke fluent Swedish which my co-workers\
  \ did not speak nor did they speak enough English for us to have more than basic\
  \ conversations. Well after the 30 min car drive we had arrived to my apartment,\
  \ it was just around the corner from my job which was nice but that was all that\
  \ was nice about it. The apartment was spacious but I had no money to buy furniture\
  \ so for over a year I slept on a mattress on the floor and had two dressers- one\
  \ for clothes and one for books. I didn't have internet so I went to Starbucks almost\
  \ everyday for a year just to use their WiFi or when the money ran out I would sit\
  \ on a bench somewhere close enough for the WiFi signal to reach my laptop or phone.\
  \ \n\nWhen I moved I was mostly afraid of not having friends and family around and\
  \ not knowing the language, what I didn't know and which came as a slap in the face\
  \ was the fact that I would actually for the first time be alone with myself and\
  \ my thoughts. It was both the best and worst time in my life, I was in such a darkness\
  \ but I came out of stronger than ever. I learned so much about myself and about\
  \ life, I was very cautious towards strangers but still open to have conversations\
  \ with them. I befriended the owner of the kiosk next to my apartment and who could\
  \ cheer me up just with his smile and small talk. I also went out to pubs by myself\
  \ but made sure only to go to gay bars as I felt safer there and had gotten to know\
  \ the bartenders there. I later started to get to know some of the guest and they\
  \ brought me to other bars and then all of a sudden I had my own clique and after\
  \ a while I became fluent in German.\n\nDid I stay in Germany? Yes for four and\
  \ a half years, then I moved on to Ireland and after two years there I went to back\
  \ to Sweden for a few months before I decided to move again. It took me approximately\
  \ seven years and four countries before I got to hug my mother again and this time\
  \ it was when she picked me up from the airport in Bangkok, Thailand. Her native\
  \ country and my new home. When the shock of me having become an adult had worn\
  \ off and my mother hugged me, I felt like that scared and excited teenager again."
