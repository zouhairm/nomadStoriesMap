Text: "Eldoret \u2013 Kenya start of journey: - \n\nI woke up this week 2nd week of\
  \ March 2019, and boarded a new seven seater (matatu Swahili word for Toyota Shuttle\
  \ travel van), from my small home town where I hail and operate from a pretty cool\
  \ and calm climate, headed for a remote location called Maraba - Tindiret in the\
  \ sub-county of Nandi North, for some business prospects with the government offices\
  \ and secondary schools. This shuttle van was destined for Narok County.\nAs the\
  \ van\u2019s engine started to simmer, I embarked on my adventurous and prospective\
  \ journey going forward, some pedestrians alighted along the way at bus stops, whereas\
  \ others entered to replace their empty seats in reverse order, to their respective\
  \ destinations. Our tarmacked roads made the traveling smooth, enjoyable though\
  \ at some points a bit bumpy.  Peeping through my left side seat window, at the\
  \ back seat, along the way, I saw how our country is rich in beautiful and magnificent\
  \ curved landscapes, unexplored by our naked eyes. There were little streams of\
  \ beautiful rivers, intertwined with clean and crisp waters running down the hills\
  \ and valleys, to the unknown. The journey\u2019s script seemed so adventurous,\
  \ seeing the eye catching beautiful sights, with natural green background landscapes,\
  \ coupled with un mixed variety of cash crop plantations, including some instances\
  \ tea, coffee and sugarcane backing up the rounded, yet some exceptionally forested\
  \ hills as we approached Nandi Hills county. I felt enlightening and safe.\n\nKopere\
  \ a T-junction first alighting point: -\n\nMy next stop over, with the first van\
  \ was a small market place as named above. Kopere is known for trading in variety\
  \ of small shops, with some temporary stalls selling roasted fresh tilapia fish,\
  \ some selling sweet potatoes, since the area is much closer to our third capital\
  \ named Kisumu City at the heart of Lake Victoria. The climate where was hotter\
  \ and area a bit dry, due to the humidity from the surrounding lake. I alighted\
  \ at this point where, my contractual fare with the first van conductor had lapsed\
  \ and switched to a second much older Toyota model van, which was, charred with\
  \ very uncomfortable seats.\n\nThe area\u2019s main occupational activity is both\
  \ un- and harvested sugar cane plantations. In less than forty-five minutes, I arrived\
  \ sound and began to explore my business prospects, with no doubt of how our country\
  \ is rich and blessed with plenty of beauty. The journey would take me to my endless\
  \ destination, to keep on exploring more by learning and sharing how the wider we\
  \ explore, the more countless we see."
