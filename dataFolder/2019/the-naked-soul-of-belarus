Text: "Like the most of these who have been born in late 80-ies in the Soviet Union,\
  \ I have zero sentiments to the socialist past. However, every time I think of \u201C\
  The Disneyland of Communism\u201D Belarus, my heart feels warm and touched. \n\n\
  My long-term relationship with Belarus has started, when I applied to the Master\
  \ prorgam that included one semester in Minsk, studying Politology. Before going\
  \ there, I had quite a vague idea on what I could expect from the country. In fact,\
  \ I didn\u2019t know about it anything, except that it is a Slavic country where\
  \ Russian is still widely spoken. \n\nAfter colorful, mountaneous Tbilisi with the\
  \ narrow streets of Old town, Minsk did not impress me with its flat avenues and\
  \ forthright architecture, mostly from Stalin era. Combined with the grey sky and\
  \ February cold it made me feel doleful. Everyday I was seeing Belarusian people\
  \ in the university, at the supermarkets, in cafes. They were always polite and\
  \ law-abiding. I hardly saw anyone shouting out loud in the street. No street musicians\
  \ or beggars either. The system seemed to be functioning perfectly well. Until once\
  \ I found the place that changed my impression on Belarus.\n\nCaf\xE9 on the first\
  \ floor of univermag (the Soviet word for supermarket) \u201CCentralny\u201D looks\
  \ like nothing has been revised here for the last 50 years. The snacks, sandwiches\
  \ and cakes are represented in the glass vitrines. You grab your food and drink\
  \ (tea, coffee, beer or even shot of vodka) and seat by the long counter in front\
  \ of the windows to the huge Independence Ave. Prices here are ridiculously cheap\
  \ and the seller ladies grumpy \u2013 just like in 1954, when this place opened.\
  \ \n\nIn the daytime, when I used to have my little lunch in \u201CCentralny\u201D\
  , there were not many visitors. Mostly old people who were carefully counting their\
  \ change while buying a cheese sandwich and the tea. But in the evening the place\
  \ was becoming much more crowded and diverse. Here you could meet loud bikers with\
  \ tattoos, having their beer. Students of Arts, sharing their impressions about\
  \ the last theater premiere. Young oppositionists, who illegally work at the Human\
  \ Rights NGO that has been never registered officially. Couples in their forties\
  \ who can\u2019t afford more than a date with the custard cream donuts. In the evenings\
  \ the place does not resemble a Soviet caf\xE9 anymore. One could feel the spirit\
  \ of freedom and abruptness in the air.\n\nMe and my international course mates\
  \ used to come here for a drink and a chat with locals. The language was a problem\
  \ for these who did not know Russian, because even young Belarusians were usually\
  \ very poor in English. But as long as you could speak Russian, people were talking\
  \ to you freely. \n\u201CBelarus is actually not what it seems\u201D, told me once\
  \ a guy in \u201CCentralny\u201D. \u201CWe try so hard to show everyone our achievements\
  \ and proof the Europe that we are strong independent State. But in fact, people\
  \ here never felt they are strong and independent. We perceive ourselves being a\
  \ margin, not the center. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t build our different identity,\
  \ but rather prefer to join existing one. Even if we are not that happy with it\u201D\
  . \n\nAnother mind blowing place in Minsk is a Belarus Free Theater. It\u2019s an\
  \ underground theater group that has no official address or premises. They play\
  \ their performances for free, based on the donations. Location of the plays is\
  \ always under the conspiracy, and information about it is sent to the shortlist\
  \ of emails. People who attend the plays bring their friends and that\u2019s how\
  \ it\u2019s being distributed through the personal recommendations. \n\nBelarus\
  \ Free Theater is not allowed to play their performances officially because it does\
  \ not compromise with the censorship. Actors on the stage take you to the world\
  \ of open, uncovered reality. They shout and blackguard on the stage, describe the\
  \ sad life of the country: many political prisoners, forceful break up of peaceful\
  \ demonstrations after the presidential elections in 2006, atmosphere of the terror\
  \ and despair. You feel like you touch its naked soul.\n\nI don't know how someone\
  \ may think, Belarus is a boring Post-Soviet country."
