Text: "From the bright blue sail boats on the shore to the white sand beaches and\
  \ the colorful culture of Philippines, Boracay has a lot to offer. The cool breeze\
  \ relaxes you as you sail to the shore and all set to explore the island of relaxation.\
  \ With a well-equipped spa at every step, this is a place which keeps you in a constant\
  \ mode of serenity. \nThis was my first international trip and Boracay was a place\
  \ that was not very popular in India for tourists as not many people had visited\
  \ there. I always wanted to explore such places that are new in my part of the world.\
  \ To reach Boracay one must take a flight to Manila and further board another aircraft\
  \ to either Caticlan or Kalibo. Further you will have to go by boat to the island\
  \ of Boracay from either of the destinations. But this island is worth taking such\
  \ efforts to reach to the heaven of tranquility. Fridays is one of my favorite resorts\
  \ of all the wonderful options; with such warm hospitality and personalized experience,\
  \ they will make you fee special all along your stay.\nThis island stretches around\
  \ 7 kilometers in length and has the best of food, shopping as well as entertainment\
  \ and relaxation in this area. This island has the multi-award winner Tirta Spa\
  \ which is a sacred paradise for someone looking for relaxation and rejuvenation\
  \ in its best form. Another spa that one must not miss out is The Khan Spa on the\
  \ White Beach Path of Boracay. A small establishment with soothing ambiance and\
  \ an affordable menu of excellent therapies to select from. If you are tired of\
  \ walking on the beach then you can even try out the local foot massage sessions\
  \ while gazing in to the crystal clear waters. This is one of the cheapest massages\
  \ of all.\nAlong with being a heaven of tranquility, Boracay is also a surfer\u2019\
  s paradise. Where one side of the beach is filled with tourists looking for a variety\
  \ of experiences, the other side is a total different world with kite surfers and\
  \ para gliders going along with the wind. There are professional sessions also available\
  \ for anyone willing to learn this fun sport. Even various international tournaments\
  \ have been taking place with kite-surfers from around the world.\nIf you are looking\
  \ out to have some fun and party all night long then you must register yourself\
  \ in the Pub Crawl. This is a group of people who will take you around to the best\
  \ of pubs and clubs in the island and make it a fun night with a variety of games\
  \ and fun activities. This is another interesting way to make some wonderful friends\
  \ while on holiday. \nOnce you are done with pub hopping with the pub crawl at night,\
  \ its time to go for island hopping. From the crystal cove or the magic islands\
  \ to the crocodile islands, there is a lot to explore. Snorkeling or scuba diving\
  \ is also a fun way to discover the coral reefs. With so much to do, one can easily\
  \ spend a week at this island and not get bored out of anything. The sun sets in\
  \ such a beautiful way that you will want to wait for another evening to experience\
  \ it one more time."
