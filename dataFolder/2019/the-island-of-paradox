Text: "A Havana summer day welcomed my arrival last July. In my backpack, I carried\
  \ a journal, a camera, and quite a number of preconceived ideas about the Caribbean\
  \ island. I was ready to experience the stories of misfortune passed down from generations\
  \ of political refugees who now call the United States their home. These same people\
  \ left their native country behind to never return. As an explorer of the world,\
  \ I knew I wanted to search for the joy in all the conflicting ideas about Cuba.\
  \ As I got off the plane, I set the intention to seek truth, particularly behind\
  \ the veil of those surface desires to flee to the neighboring nation that promises\
  \ an 'American Dream'.\n\nAnd so it began. I paid attention to detail. I noticed\
  \ how people went about their day, routines and behaviors. Most of my encounters\
  \ with locals came about from effortless conversations just by me asking for directions.\
  \ One gentlemen told me something I would never forget, \"Survival really has a\
  \ way of teaching you how to love your neighbor.\" \n\nWhen people saw me walking\
  \ past their homes, they invited me in for coffee without a clue of who I was thanks\
  \ to my friendly demeanor. In one of those encounters, a woman recommended I visit\
  \ Cuba's seawall, el Malecon, because musicians played their handmade instruments\
  \ there to make a living. I quickly learned how the island uses the arts to express\
  \ their imaginative side of someday having just a little more\u2013 a little more\
  \ food, a little more opportunity, a little more freedom. On the other side of self-expression\
  \ is a life they could not see otherwise. Singing and dancing eases the monotony\
  \ of everyday life. \n\nI observed how people communicated, and the way they showed\
  \ affection. People rarely called each other by their names, instead they referred\
  \ to one another as: \"mi amor\" (my love), mi vida (my life), corazon (heart),\
  \ bella (beautiful).\" Their language, forms of expression and affection opened\
  \ my heart after just a few days of integration in the Cuban culture. Two days was\
  \ enough to uncover a common theme among its people: love.\n\nDespite the political\
  \ turmoil the country is infamously known for, the paradox is that the souls of\
  \ Cuba know more love than some of the wealthiest nations. \nVisiting this country\
  \ taught me how to approach every place I visit with this newfound intention of\
  \ searching for joy and love because when you do you truly see the place\u2013 not\
  \ for its politics, beliefs, or history\u2013 but its people on a soul level. To\
  \ me, that is the true beauty of a place."
