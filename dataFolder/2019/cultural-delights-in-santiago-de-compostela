Text: "Santiago de Compostela in north-west Spain is the end point for perhaps the\
  \ most famous pilgrimage in the world, the Camino de Santiago, and a fine place\
  \ to make local connections with musicians, artists, artisans, academics, merchants\
  \ and pilgrims.  The walking trip there is an enthralling experience by all accounts,\
  \ but the leisurely all day train trip my wife and I took from Bilbao also had its\
  \ rewards, crossing the vast plains of Castilla Y Leon and into the higher country\
  \ of Galicia, Spain\u2019s Celtic and most westerly region. Whilst the fast AVE\
  \ trains only allow fleeting glimpses of the passing terrain this one allows picturesque\
  \ villages, fields, churches, outcrops, passes and distant mountains to be comfortably\
  \ savoured.  Even the dry flat landscapes of Castilla Y Leon offer a kind of mesmerising\
  \ relaxation.\nThe place to stay in Santiago de Compostela is the old town.  Having\
  \ arrived at night, we were thankful the taxi driver knew the way through the maze\
  \ of narrow avenues to our lodgings just down from the cathedral.  The first thing\
  \ to get used to was the tolling of the cathedral bell every hour.  Far from intrusive\
  \ however, it was a comforting kind of peal that constantly proclaimed all is well.\
  \  Only in the morning did we realise our sunny top floor flat had the most romantic\
  \ view we could have wished for across the rustic terracotta centuries old rooves.\n\
  Music, art and architecture are integral to the Santiago experience. There is a\
  \ modern concert hall, the Auditorio de Galicia, a number of small and large art\
  \ museums, and impressive buildings dating as far back as the 10th and 11th centuries.\
  \  The ancient cobbled avenues and squares of the old town, with its talented buskers,\
  \ street merchants and tiny stores are good places to connect with traditional Celtic\
  \ culture.  Ten steps from our door was a store with beautiful crafts like leather\
  \ book covers carved with Celtic swirls, ornate jewellery and unusual instruments.\
  \  One was an ocarina or asubio designed by the Galician sculptor and ceramicist\
  \ Manuel Paparolo, and made by the proprietor who was happy to demonstrate this\
  \ tiny flute for us.  His musical hero and friend is the famous Galician bagpiper\
  \ Carlos Nunez.  We made a strong connection despite the language barrier, when\
  \ I presented him with a Celtic harp album I had recorded.  With delight he improvised\
  \ along with the tunes.  Music transcends all barriers.\nNext door, more beautiful\
  \ jewellery, local fashions and rare CDs of ancient music relating to or recorded\
  \ in the cathedral.  We were quickly buying gorgeous artefacts and we had barely\
  \ stepped outside the door.\nOne evening after exploring the massively ornate interior\
  \ of the cathedral, with its gold and carved wood decorations, beautifully painted\
  \ walls and worn marble steps we were approached by an eccentric and endearing local\
  \ music professor selling the university choir\u2019s compact disc.  He spontaneously\
  \ outlined the history of the town and the cathedral, with a precise account of\
  \ ongoing repairs to its water-damaged interior.  A finer salesman indeed.  Then\
  \ as the last golden rays turned the cathedral red, tired pilgrims rolled in, and\
  \ a Celtic harpist\u2019s sweet tunes drifted across the square, we ambled down\
  \ to a beautiful tapas meal in one of the many excellent restaurants, where you\
  \ can either eat at the bar or at a table.  Delicious and inexpensive seafood like\
  \ razor clams and octopus, accompanied by patatas bravas and other assorted dishes\
  \ as well as wine from Rioja provided an unforgettable gastronomic sensation.\n\
  A day trip to the nearby seaside town of A Coruna is a must.  At Spain\u2019s most\
  \ north-westerly tip, this charming place with its beautiful wharf, beach, art museum\
  \ and town centre is a mere thirty minutes by train.  Here we were treated to a\
  \ guided tour of the apartment Pablo Picasso lived in as a boy for four years while\
  \ his father was a professor at the School of Fine Arts.  We then visited the art\
  \ museum for an amazing exhibition by the Spanish Impressionist painter Joaquin\
  \ Sorolla, better known in his homeland than elsewhere.\nThe peace, spiritual serenity\
  \ and joy making local connections in Galicia all constituted a delicious treat\
  \ we will long remember."
