Text: "I never imagined as I pulled up to the border of Zambia in my small Hyundai\
  \ Rental I\u2019d be greeted by the most beautiful and massive elephants gently\
  \ roaming around. They were definitely much larger than they tiny hatchback I was\
  \ driving. \u201CLook there\u2019s Pumba!\u201D, my friend shouted playfully. Not\
  \ the on screen Pumba but definitely a group of warthogs scrambling my under the\
  \ sun. I\u2019ve read about Victoria Falls many times in my travel magazine and\
  \ I made it a bucket list goal. So while visiting South Africa my friends and I\
  \ decided to take a road trip through Botswana and upward into Zambia for the experience.\
  \ Devil\u2019s Pool they call it is one of the most exhilarating swims you\u2019\
  ll ever take. Yes you have to be a good swimmer and my friend found out it pays\
  \ to stay in shape. As we were guided across the Beautiful and gigantic Zambezi\
  \ River My friend calmly started to float downstream with the current. Our tour\
  \ guide went to fetch her and we continued our swim across. Of course I wondered\
  \ about crocodiles and what would happen if I had to wrestle one during this tour.\
  \ After a swim across current we were finally at the famed location. I would finally\
  \ get to see what it is like to climb into a waterfall and peer over the edge. As\
  \ tiny harmless fish nibbles on my toes I carefully climbed into the pool. The current\
  \ is pretty strong and I was holding on for dear life because who wants to report\
  \ back that they almost went over the falls. As my friends and I made our way over\
  \ the edge guess what we saw? The most beautiful, double rainbow. What more proof\
  \ do you need that you were supposed to be there than a double rainbow. As we took\
  \ our Titanic style photos as we peeped over the edge at the rushing water, there\
  \ was no other place in the world that I would\u2019ve rather been."
