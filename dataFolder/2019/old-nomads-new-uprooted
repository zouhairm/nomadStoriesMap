Text: "In 1988, in the south of Colombia, a group of indigenous Nukak appeared in\
  \ the municipality of Calamar, 85 kilometers south of San Jos\xE9 del Guaviare.\
  \ This is the famous contact that went around the world as the first time this community\
  \ was heard, even though there are some registered connections in de 60s and the\
  \ 70s between them and peasant settlers . The indigenous Nukak are the last nomad\
  \ people of contact tradition in Colombia and in the last 30 years they have been\
  \ forced to settle in the settlements provided by the mayors and the nation, when\
  \ before the used to move in a huge region of 55,000 Km2. The idea is to travel\
  \ there, to talk with them -some of the Nukak now speak spanish-, and try to give\
  \ the story in three main information blocks. First, those indigenous that now live\
  \ in settlements and that have terrible problems of sickness and unproductivity\
  \ because they can't live their way of life but they are not really integrated to\
  \ the \"western\" system, so they pass the day lying down waiting for help. This\
  \ as an example of a bad way to dialogue with groups that have another cosmology.\
  \ The second block includes the vision of the relation with western society. This\
  \ includes de vision of the government but also the situation that the Nukak community\
  \ had live because of the conflict. The first block is to experience with those\
  \ indigenous that still in a nomad way of life."
