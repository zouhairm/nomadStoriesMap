Text: "Walking Around The Island \nI didn\u2019t live anywhere here, I wasn\u2019\
  t the part of their community, but they invited me to experience their culture.\
  \ I was here Langkawi, Malaysia, my excitement level was top notch as the flight\
  \ landed and when I was moving on foreign roads for the very first time. Around\
  \ 11.00 am the local time we checked in Hotel Aseania, and immediately after that,\
  \ I told my Dad the hat I going out to find the beachside. I tempted to go in the\
  \ left direction, I measured out the walk on my smartphone showing the beach 2 km\
  \ away. I was an outsider on this island, little nervous but moving ahead in excitement.\
  \ I encountered people of the different psyche, the lady playing her Dj fun, local\
  \ people marking out the island map to other tourists, a person lending his scooty\
  \ on rent, and welcoming charm of city cleaners around.\n\u201CAs-Salaam-Alaikum\u201D\
  , a person greeted as I was moving on the footpath.\n\"Wa-Alaikum-salaam\u201D,\
  \ I replied with great enthusiasm.\nI didn\u2019t live anywhere here, I don\u2019\
  t the part of their community, but they invited me to experience in here was incredible.\
  \ I was feeling connected with humanity again, the magical walk was one of my happiest\
  \ time. I reached at end of the walk, standing on shore water touching my feet.\
  \ I definitely spent some time letting waves bury my feet and close my eyes for\
  \ a moment\u2026.It\u2019s a wonderful sensation walking in the streets, finding\
  \ new people and having the island gradually reveal itself. I carry a small part\
  \ of my life, walking around imprinting the memories I can admire and cherish forever.\
  \ \nIsland Hopping\nWith the griming sound of motor screeching its pace, the hidden\
  \ treasures of Malaysia started to unfold.\nThe giant formations and jungle scenario\
  \ took off by the mesmerising view of waves ticking back. Within a few seconds,\
  \ boatman crunched the boat to its top speed. The fast patches of moving ahead captivated\
  \ my breath.\nThe boatman first took us to Fresh Water Island, an island with a\
  \ natural lake. We need to walk 3 km, to visit the lake. The classification exists,\
  \ when we dine to the way we can feel a compression that we are leading a going\
  \ to the other dimension through the caves. The view of the lake was mesmerizing,\
  \ it took my peace to another dimension. \nOn way to the second island, boatman\
  \ fed the Eagles They were sailing along the boat, shoulder to shoulder in search\
  \ of the moment when chicken will be thrown and they\u2019ll get their Bon Appetite.\
  \ We sailed along the other island inhabited islands, some were small and some big\
  \ with haunted tag intact catering a dense look. \nI made our way to Beras Basah\
  \ Island, it gluers through its name. I found no person living in here, just torquiest\
  \ waster defining its way from the jungle. I removed my shorts and went straight\
  \ to water adding its pinch to make me realize its real. \n\u201CEveryone be here\
  \ once in a lifetime.\u201D I felt alike\n From uncharted lines, breath-taking viewpoints\
  \ ended my island journey. I backed to memories of tropical charters, with a big\
  \ smile on my face.\n\u201CBye. Will meet if life gives me another chance to visit\
  \ you\u201D, I said and moved forward\nOnce in a life, you need to be a \u2018beach\
  \ person\u2019 look the world away from the crowd and spoil yourself in water times.\
  \ Find the perfect paradise for your own self and enjoy."
