Text: "Sometimes, you can see something both absolutely beautiful, but utterly devastating,\
  \ all at the same time. It wasn't the large crowd of people standing there that\
  \ had drawn me in. \nVisiting Melbourne, you learn pretty quickly that there are\
  \ crowds everywhere. Crowds of people waiting for shops to open, to bumble off to\
  \ work, to watch the latest street performer (and trust me, there's plenty to pick\
  \ from). Everybody moves quickly, legs pumping up and down in unison, almost, and\
  \ if you don't keep up- you'll be left behind. \nEverywhere you go in Melbourne,\
  \ no matter the time, there are people moving with you. Crowds aren't special in\
  \ Melbourne. In a loud, bustling, overflowing city like Melbourne crowds and noise\
  \ aren't peculiar, but rather, silence is.  \nThat's how I found this particular\
  \ crowd of people: silent, and standing in front of bouquets upon bouquets of flowers.\
  \ The flowers covered past the sidewalk, spilling onto the street. It was kaleidoscopic.\
  \ Tied in with the colourful flowers were teddy bears, and hand written letters.\
  \ It took me a moment to realise what I was looking at was a graveyard. It's easy\
  \ to forget tragedy when it doesn't happen to you. But sometimes, you stand in the\
  \ same spot that you realise somebody also once stood on, who also thought today\
  \ was just another normal day. Sometimes, it's overwhelming, how long you can stand\
  \ in front of this memorial, holding your breath, until your head gets dizzy. \n\
  On the other side of the street, people still moved, talking to each other about\
  \ weekend plans, or work schedules. There was still graffiti covering one side of\
  \ a wall. There were still shops in the process of opening for the day. There were\
  \ honks of traffic, and coffee machines, and the world kept moving. But it was like\
  \ I had entered a bubble. A bubble of loss, and vividly thinking about those who\
  \ had been attacked on what was meant to be any normal day. The Bourke Street Car\
  \ Attack had been all over the news for days, but I had never connected it. I had\
  \ never thought about how I was travelling to a hotel, with my best friend, just\
  \ one street over from Bourke Street. I had never thought that there would be people\
  \ mourning, and working to cover a sidewalk with flowers and bears, and 'I\u2019\
  m so sorry's'. For a brief moment, I wasn't part of the world. I wasn't just another\
  \ person walking along, sightseeing, and laughing. I wasn't another person late\
  \ for work, or getting ready to perform on the sidewalk with my guitar. I wasn't\
  \ important, and I didn't matter, and that was the absolute perspective needed.\
  \ \nI still remember standing there, and feeling how tight my chest got. It wasn't\
  \ just that people had been murdered here, just a week ago, in a terrorist attack.\
  \ It was that since then, people had actively been coming, and paying their respects.\
  \ How wonderfully beautiful, but tragic, all at the same time. How wonderfully thoughtful\
  \ that so many people had been to buy flowers, and bears, and cover not only a sidewalk,\
  \ but a road, and part of a bluish-grey stone building. How could something so tragic\
  \ and awful bring out the best in others? How could it have been that someone else\
  \ doing something terrible, and thoughtless, now made so many others do the exact\
  \ opposite? \n\"Come on.\" My best friend, with her golden yellow hair, held out\
  \ her hand for me. I didn't realise how long I had been standing here for, mourning\
  \ for people I had never known. But I didn't need to know them. Sometimes, when\
  \ something senseless happens, it happens to a whole world, and a whole society.\
  \ I may not have known those 6 killed, personally, but I bet they had been part\
  \ of crowds, and noise, in Melbourne, one day too.  I bet they had stopped to look\
  \ at new graffiti, listen to street performers, and travel to new cities. I bet\
  \ they had once been just like me, and the people I did know, too."
