Text: "I was a dreamer and a lover, in the wellknown \u201CCity of Love\u201D. When\
  \ the plane landed I couldn\u2019t believe it, I was fourteen years old and I was\
  \ walking in my lifelong dream across the Atlantic sea. But men! I have heard a\
  \ lot about it, that part of me almost felt like I have been there before.\nThe\
  \ trip was because of my fifteen birthday present. Two weeks around Central Europe:\
  \ Belgium, The Netherlands We landed in Paris where my family and I visited the\
  \ city as much as we could in four days for then renting a small car so we could\
  \ drive in the European highways. But, Oh Paris! Excuse-moi if I only write about\
  \ you, but you are so different. You are multifaceted that one day you could be\
  \ sweet and the other day, bitter. Paris made me fall in love with her, but at the\
  \ same time it broke my heart. Because, Paris, what about the people living down\
  \ your bridges? And the homeless in the streets that are taking care of a pet? The\
  \ last day I was in the city, my family and I decided to give the homeless the food\
  \ that we had left, because we were not able to took them into the airplane. I delivered\
  \ to a lonely man, in the Latin Quartier, a crossaint and a milk tetra pack, he\
  \ smiled, thanked us and cutted the bread into two, giving one piece to his dog\
  \ and eating the other half of the bread. How manyo f you can imagine? That\u2019\
  s a memory I think I will never forget. Even the lonely ones wanted to feel love\
  \ in he \u201CCity of Love\u201D, anybody wanted to feel alone. Everyone in Paris\
  \ want to feel loved. I confirmed that there are still people in the world that\
  \ having little, gives a lot, people that is a lot. And not only that homeless,\
  \ but also all the African inmigrants that are able to speak more tan one language\
  \ in the attempt to sell you Eiffel\u2019s Tower souvenirs.\nAfter telling you Paris\
  \ isn\u2019t Paris movies, that sometimes Champs Elys\xE9es is full of cigarrete\
  \ butts and that chaos exist. I must tell you that the people who visit Paris and\
  \ do not fall in love with it, are completely fools. Travellers, be warned when\
  \ people say that you would need a full life to visit the  entire Louvre Museum,\
  \ because let me tell you,  that is not true, you would need a full life to visit\
  \ the whole Paris, all its corners and all its secrets. \nIf you visit Paris make\
  \ sure you buy a good and cheap wine and a baguette in the nearest boulangerie to\
  \ your hotel, make a picnic in Trocadero in the afternoon and climb the Eiffel Tower\
  \ at that same time so you can watch the sunset from above and then the illuminated\
  \ city. Take your time and do not run trying to catch up the city. Wait! sit in\
  \ the Jardin des Tuileries to read a book or for seeing people go by. Listen how\
  \ time goes by. Before going to Paris, read about Paris, about its history, culture\
  \ and gastronomy, so you can perceive the city with another look. Talk with the\
  \ locals and visit places where locals go. \nGet lost and find yourself in a different\
  \ city, in a different country. \nLet me tell you that at the end, I came to the\
  \ conclusion that maybe is not called \u201CCity of Love\u201D, because of the couples\
  \ that spend hours kissing around while holding hands in the streets, but instead\
  \ on behalf of the so-called \u201Clovers of love\u201D and the one\u2019s that\
  \ fall in love with the city itself."
