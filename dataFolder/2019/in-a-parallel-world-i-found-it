Text: "Inspired by an old note I found in one of my books and for all my feelings\
  \ for him, I bought a fly ticket to Switzerland without doubting.\nWe met each other\
  \ two times in Mexico, and since the first day it was like the perfect timing feeling\
  \ for both of us. \nWhen he returned to Switzerland, we daily speak for almost a\
  \ year and a half. Loved speaking with he and also love all things he continuously\
  \ shared with me about his life.\nAt the end of our countdown, I was feeling excited\
  \ and a little shy too. I always will remember the feeling I had while boarding\
  \ the plane, first for knowing that will see him again after a long time and the\
  \ other that for second time in my life was flying to Europe again, my favorite\
  \ place in the world.\n\nWe shared lovely days together, he take me to very nice\
  \ places to take meal, movie theater, for walks near the lake, etc. As he knew I\
  \ like Italy a lot, he take me too to a very cute place name Lugano, near the border\
  \ with Italy. Arriving there was like experiencing again Italy but in little, love\
  \ all the cobblestone streets, the fresh air, the people and it\u2019s food. \n\n\
  We enjoyed my short stay living and sharing moments together. From the first day\
  \ we saw each other in Mexico,  it was as it was meant to be, cause we had the opportunity\
  \ to know each other regardless of the distance. For me it was like I found the\
  \ right man in a parallel world from mine, cause after a hard break I got that feeling\
  \ again. \nFor sure I was not thinking it was just a summer love, cause we had almost\
  \ a pair of years knowing each other by the distance, but I was also aware things\
  \ can go ahead or stop at any moment after this days.\nFortunate or unfortunately\
  \ we didn\u2019t make it, but I will always be happy and grateful to had risked,\
  \ cause in case I hadn\u2019t, for sure many times will ask myself: what if I had\
  \ gone?\nI will always treasure those days, that love, that trip, all wonderful\
  \ moments and all my mental and graphics pics of that wonderful country too, is\
  \ just life, it can surprise you in many ways.\nSometimes I think it\u2019s great\
  \ that in a parallel world I found the one."
