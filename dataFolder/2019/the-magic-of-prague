Text: "I did not know I was going to find adoration of a country in Central Europe.\
  \ The country has mesmerizing architecture, beer-spas, and affordable spending,\
  \ Prague has some magic. The idea to go t Prague was because of it's cost of spending\
  \ and wanted to be somewhere before heading to Munich for the opening weekend of\
  \ Oktoberfest.\n\nWhen I was arriving, humorously speaking, I had joking thoughts\
  \ of the country like the Slavic food, addida's track suits and graffiti apartments\
  \ something that would depict from that one Owen Wilson action flick \"Behind Enemy\
  \ Lines.\" Jokes aside, I knew it would not be that way. As I left Prague's airport,\
  \ with my driver taking me to my hostel, where it was located in Old Town. During\
  \ the drive, we go through this tunnel and at the end of it , there it was, architecture\
  \ beauty. Beautiful, rich Gothic-style roofs, century aged bridges and the noticeable\
  \ Prague Castle arching over the city like an 80's fantasy-fiction book cover. This\
  \ is Prague.\n\nSetting foot into the center of Old Town, I was beyond hypnotize.\
  \ The cobblestone roads, Old town square with the Astronomical clock neighboring\
  \ it and fifteen minutes away from the square (if you know where you are going)\
  \ is Charles Bridge . Every corner of the city conveyed beauty and fascination.\
  \  \n\nBesides my praise with the city's design and architecture, the currency exchange\
  \ with the U.S. dollar is quite affordable, getting that \"bang for your buck.\"\
  \ With the luxury of spending and seeing a fascinating city with so much history\
  \ and again magnetic architecture, it is a blessing and undermined city to visit.\
  \ I also suggest to wake up early and do the major attractions: Charles Bridge and\
  \ Prague Castle so you can avoid the tour groups and you would feel much better\
  \ when it hits 1030a.m. and it's crowded with locals and tourists.  And if you're\
  \ on the Prague Castle side of the city, hang out at Petrin Hill where you can find\
  \ this miniature tower that gives you stunning views of the whole city.\n\nWhen\
  \ I share to others my favorite experience of Prague, it was walking around the\
  \ city at night.  At night, the streets are empty, practically desolated, it is\
  \ such a therapeutic feeling\n\nAdventuring through the United States, living in\
  \ Japan, and spending half a summer in the Philippines are some experiences I have\
  \ spent through my lifespan. I didn't expect to find myself to fall in love with\
  \ Prague, Czech Republic."
