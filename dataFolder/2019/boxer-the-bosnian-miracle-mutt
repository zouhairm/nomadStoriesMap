Text: "There were six of us, five Australians and an American, all from different\
  \ backgrounds, all staying in this hostel in Trebinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. We\
  \ ventured out together to see some the local landmarks, this time to an abandoned\
  \ castle a decent 7 kilometre hike one way. \nOn our way back, Paddy, the clown\
  \ of the group, took us on a path he saw a few hours earlier, thinking it would\
  \ be some spontaneous short cut; it was. While walking along the raised path that\
  \ runs parallel with the river, heading towards the centre of town, we stop briefly\
  \ and ever so quietly hear a whining noise. We pause. We look around. We hear nothing.\
  \ We continue walking thinking nothing more of it. A few more steps. We hear the\
  \ whining again. Looking down into the drop off we see a card board box containing\
  \ a puppy, a two month old Serbian Tri-coloured Hound to be exact; back legs broken,\
  \ sores and open wounds covering its body, and dragging itself ever so slowly towards\
  \ us in a look that was beyond desperation. \nI jump down, pick up the exhausted\
  \ pup in it's cardboard box, and continue walking into town in hope of a Vet.\n\
  In what was literally a 500 metre walk we come to the only Vet in town. We head\
  \ inside. We get him checked, dressings put on his wounds, water and milk in his\
  \ belly, and a warm blanket to sleep. When asked what to name the dog the answer\
  \ came naturally, Boxer, because we found him in a cardboard box and because he\
  \ was as strong, capable, and brave as a Boxer. We talk with the Veterinarians about\
  \ what was possible for Boxer and told that he needed X-rays, but could only be\
  \ done in Sarajevo, the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital an 8 hour drive away.\nThe\
  \ group talked possibilities, even mentioning the idea of smuggling the pup across\
  \ the Macedonian border, but we figured this whole saga started in a spontaneous\
  \ decision, and so we made another one; destination, Sarajevo. \nWe hired a van.\
  \ A Mercedes with worn out rims, very high mileage, and most likely dodgy brakes.\
  \ It's only a great story if you risk your life a little, right? On our journey\
  \ we get pulled over by cops every hour and told some new story about having to\
  \ pay a fine and showing our passports, none of it was true, and with each new set\
  \ of officers we simply waited 15 minutes, refused to pay, and then were kindly\
  \ sent on our way. In between these local greetings we begin making connections\
  \ with Vets and local dog shelters in Sarajevo, and come across two strong contenders\
  \ to look after our lil' man. We arrive. We head to the Vet to get him X-rayed.\
  \ He comes out, finished after the whole process. Turns out he has a bullet lodged\
  \ in his spine and was shot at 2 weeks of age, then thrown out in the cardboard\
  \ box to die. When we found him he was literally on his last legs. With surgery\
  \ posing more risks to his health, and the possibility of him being able to walk\
  \ again if surgery was not done, we decided to not follow through. \nIn a whirlwind\
  \ of rage, tears, heartache and relief we bring him to a shelter a few kilometres\
  \ outside of Sarajevo, where this beautiful family looks after 50 or more dogs.\
  \ \nThrough our efforts of crowdfunding we manage to raise enough money for continual\
  \ treatment, food and shelter and visit him each day on our 3 day stay in the capital.\
  \ \nWe often receive updates about Boxer, who is now 7 months old, healthy, happy,\
  \ and able to walk on 3 legs. \nWhile on our journey back to Trebinje the six of\
  \ us sit silently in the Mercedes, exhausted ourselves, relieved yet so full of\
  \ accomplishment. We started as another group of travellers and finished as a family.\
  \ \nWith the sun setting on our final leg one can only think that the shortest route\
  \ can sometimes lead to the biggest adventure."
