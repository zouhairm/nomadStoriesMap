Text: "There is hardly anything impressive about this place. Located forty kilometers\
  \ away from the closest city, it becomes evident that time has forsaken this lost\
  \ town. \n\nI step out of the car and look at the rhythmic harvesting efforts down\
  \ the horizon, feeling completely isolated from the bustling scene. \u201CWho are\
  \ you looking for?\u201D A woman with a hefty yoke on her shoulders approaches.\
  \ She struggles to maintain balance as the baskets hanging from the yoke\u2019s\
  \ two ends swing back and forth precariously. \n\n\u201CDo you happen to know where\
  \ c\u1EE5 S\u01A1n used to teach?\u201D asks my father.\n\u201CC\u1EE5 S\u01A1n\
  \ from the plains? Everyone knows him. Come.\u201D Eagerly she turns around, mindlessly\
  \ lets the rice hat slip down the back of her neck. \n\nDuring the Vietnam-American\
  \ War, grandfather was reassigned to Luc Ngan to teach the local children. Having\
  \ made a comfortable home for himself here, he would frequently hop on his rusty\
  \ bike and pedal the day-long journey even years after the war had ended. Following\
  \ his passing two months earlier, I have now come with father to pay tribute.\n\n\
  \u201CHere\u201D, the women unlatches the wooden door and brings a beam of light\
  \ into an otherwise pit-black classroom. Though abandoned, it is not soulless. Rows\
  \ of bamboo chairs are stacked neatly against the wall. A few pieces of crumpled\
  \ paper lie on top. As the chalk ashes rise, I gradually gravitate my eyes toward\
  \ the dusty board where they culminate. The farther I step inside, the further back\
  \ in the past I go.  \n\nThe woman\u2019s fond memories of grandfather and his austere\
  \ classroom expose me to another side of him, one which we have been completely\
  \ ignorant of. In our family, it has long been a mystery as to why grandfather loved\
  \ this humble place so much. There was even resentment from grandmother, who thought\
  \ that in his absence from the family, grandfather failed to live up to his responsibilities\
  \ during difficult war times.\n\nGrowing up, it was not rare for me to stumble onto\
  \ my relatives\u2019 whispers about grandfather's quirks. How he would randomly\
  \ smile at flowers, vehemently argue with the neighbors, and shrug carelessly at\
  \ others\u2019 opinions. Some candidly thought that he should have been taken to\
  \ a psychiatric ward. \n\nIn his little village where everyone was stricken by poverty\
  \ and consumed by war efforts, grandfather\u2019s optimism which stretched far beyond\
  \ was deemed a measure of idiosyncrasy. Yet, upon being here, I start to connect\
  \ the dots. \n\nAmidst times of hardship, this town of normalcy must have provided\
  \ a safe harbor for grandfather to continue his pursuits. He taught, he lived, he\
  \ was carefree. \n\nWe exit the classroom, wave goodbye to the kind woman, and continue\
  \ on with our walk. As we go off a hilly beaten path, father stops and points to\
  \ a slope to his right. I try to focus while catching my breath. \n\n\u201CMany\
  \ summers ago, your grandfather took me here on his bicycle. As we got off the bike\
  \ and climbed up that slope, he whistled his favorite song and thought it would\
  \ be fun to give me a new name. He called me \u2018Quoc Hong\u2019, short for 'To\
  \ Quoc Mau Hong', which translate into \u2018Pink Country\u2019. During the war,\
  \ he had faith in our country\u2019s future, and him coming here to teach was his\
  \ way of contributing to our progress.\u201D\n\nI ponder for a while, and suddenly\
  \ feel heaviness on my shoulders. It is a sense of responsibility to relentlessly\
  \ keep moving forth. \u201CQuoc Hong, Quoc Hong,\u201D I mutter...  \n\nThe war\
  \ ended over four decades ago. While the rest of the country briskly develops, this\
  \ town stands unchanged, completely unbeknownst to the world around it. But that\u2019\
  s ok. Now, like grandfather, it provides me an escape to come back to and harbor\
  \ new dreams. \n\nI look down the horizon. I see grandfather\u2019s hope lingers.\
  \ I see my future unfolds."
