Text: "When my friend asked if I would join her for a last minute trip to the Marshall\
  \ Islands, my first response was, \"YES!\"  and my second response was, \"Where\
  \ are the Marshall Islands?\" \n\nI soon discovered the tiny group of atolls in\
  \ the western region of the pacific known as Micronesia but more accurately, I discovered\
  \ a loving people who endured many hardships but despite their past, they live simply\
  \ and happily today. It was the unexpected trip that taught me unexpected lasting\
  \ life lessons that continue to shaped me still today. \n\nMy friend Hailey lived\
  \ in the Marshall islands years before and I was accompanying for her first return.\
  \ On a whim, we found ourselves landing on a thin strip of white sand and swaying\
  \ palms amid the vast cobalt blue pacific. With just the bags on our backs and no\
  \ prior planning, we embarked on an adventure, in the truest sense of the word.\
  \ \n\nWith very few flights arriving on such a tiny island, everyone seemed to know\
  \ who came and went and our arrival did not go unnoticed. We didn't have too much\
  \ trouble hitching a ride from the airport as we began our quest  to find some old\
  \ acquaintances. Word travels fast. With the help of random strangers, we were led\
  \ to a remote village where we encountered a welcoming soul.\n\nA feeble yet spry\
  \ old woman named Rose met us and instantly welcomed us into her home. She lit up\
  \ when she saw these two foreigners walking the familiar roads of her village. We\
  \ were immediately ushered into her simple home and onto to a fine woven mat on\
  \ the floor and adorned with crowns of flowers. We had been granted our place to\
  \ stay in the Marshall islands. I didn't speak a lick of Marshallese but I learned\
  \ the greeting word, 'Yokwe' and you'd be amazed at just how far you can get by\
  \ with just \"yokwe\" and a smile. Rose insisted we call her 'Bubu,' which in Marshallese\
  \ means grandmother. She was a spunky woman who raised 9 children, and countless\
  \ grandchildren (she literally lost count) and now, she welcomed a few more in like\
  \ we were her own. \n\nBubu saw it as honor for us to be in her home. In fact, she\
  \ enjoyed parading her foreign friends around the village to announce \"they are\
  \ staying with me.\" Throughout our visit we met friendly islanders who live simple\
  \ lives on an island that has just one road looping from end to end on the 'c' shaped\
  \ atoll. I was fascinated to see that homes here remain unfurnished, without even\
  \ chairs or beds. They keep life to the basics and yet they thrive. \n\nThe hard\
  \ slab floors inside remain empty by day but at night, I awoke to find upwards of\
  \ twenty people curled up around me, without pillows or padding, sleeping on the\
  \ cement floors. It was an privilege to be accepted into such a close-knit society.\
  \ They cherish their familial relations so much so that even their beloved dead\
  \ are interred in the yard, keeping their departed close. Everyone has a family\
  \ grave on their land and the beach in their backyard. The pristine waters of the\
  \ lagoon were so inviting that we swam out among the florescent sea life and discovered\
  \ sunken vessels that spoke of a time past. \n\nOver bowls of rice and raw tuna\
  \ Bubu shared stories of growing up here under Japanese rule. She was just a child\
  \ during the second world war and was forced to work in a labor camp in Jaluit where\
  \ she was permitted one meager meal a day. She had survived prison camps, warfare\
  \ and atomic bombings in her islands but the profound smile lines on her face were\
  \ the roadmap of a blissful life well-lived, despite the trials. \n\nAs poor and\
  \ humble as she was, no expense was sparred for her guests. As she placed a carefully\
  \ woven ornate shell necklace over my head when we departed, she flashed her warmest\
  \ smile. That image remained with me ever since as a reminder that no matter the\
  \ circumstances of your existence, life is meant to be enjoyed. I intend to do so."
