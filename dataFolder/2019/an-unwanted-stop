Text: "The plane landed midway through flight. No warnings, no seat upright position\
  \ precaution. Out the windows, all I could see were mountains and two heavily armed\
  \ guards securing a small gateway to the poorly paved strip of tarmac. Two small\
  \ vans approached and we were told to grab our bags and get on the old looking,\
  \ barely standing on four wheels, vehicles. We left the airport with some misspelled\
  \ words told by a man with a badge hanging from his neck, promising that we would\
  \ be in Kathmandu in less than five hours.\n \nAt the back of the van, cocooned\
  \ between duffel bags, trying to decipher a foreign language that my fellow travelers\
  \ were speaking around me, I set my gaze out of the surprisingly clean window and\
  \ braced myself for what could only be a frightening journey out of the Himalayans\
  \ valleys. Bends too rounded, roads too narrow and views deep enough to fit all\
  \ imaginative ways of plummeting to my death rose at every corner. But as we deviated\
  \ around the mountains, a fascinating yellow-hazed world appeared around us. People,\
  \ rice fields, houses and tractors seemed to belong to an old album containing yellow\
  \ and faded photographies of contemporary life. \n\nLost in some sort of Akira Kurosawa\
  \ dream, it took me a few seconds to notice when hours later we stopped along the\
  \ HO6 \"highway\" for a bathroom break. It could hardly be called a town, in fact,\
  \ with more unfinished buildings and houses than an abandoned construction site;\
  \ it looked impossibly dystopian. Hungry and with time to spare, I got out of the\
  \ van and noticed a communal table for workers constructing a soon to be another\
  \ unfinished building. After a dialogue, that could hardly be considered a conversation\
  \ with the driver of the van, I approached the table eager to eat. Though no one\
  \ seemed to speak English, I found my way to the counter and ordered a Dal Bath\
  \ with Nan, before finding a place among the workers. We all waited for our food.\
  \ We all seemed hungry.  \n\nAs the meteorite that crash-landed on Earth, I was\
  \ the epicenter at the table. All Nepali workers were either looking or talking\
  \ to me. We tried to understand each other despite our stomachs growling incessantly.\
  \ Across the table, I met Kancha: a 45 years old Nepali, ex-carpenter, turned mountain\
  \ guide and reconverted into carpenter after losing all but one toe. \"Walk wood\
  \ easy. Walk mountain difficult\", he puts it. As he translated different voices,\
  \ I felt part of a village lost to my self-centered existence by sharing laughs\
  \ and involuntary fasting with fascinating people.\n\nThen, as someone served us\
  \ some very strong liquor, more and more translators appeared around the table the\
  \ less I needed then. But all it took to silence my new friends and I was a dish\
  \ served first: mine. While I kept looking at the cook wondering about where everybody\
  \ else\u2019s food was, silence stood around us bigger than mouth bites.  \"Mesmerizing\
  \ how food dictates humor\", I said awkwardly in an empty attempt to resurrect the\
  \ \"communal\" part of our communal table. As the silence lingered on, so did my\
  \ untouched food. I wouldn't dare to eat.   \n\nAfter what felt like eons, two very\
  \ big pots arrived, and with them, smiles and the incredible time we were having\
  \ before. I rejoiced with my new friends and ate the delicious food until I overheard,\
  \ beneath the rubble of fed voices, the musically prone horn of my van. It was an\
  \ incredible moment, yet I didn't want to be part of a life so far apart from my\
  \ own. I was scared to be left behind. \"Don't worry\", said Kancha in a very hesitant\
  \ voice to my very hesitant face. But the van was a portal to a parallel universe;\
  \ I stood up and urged the cook for the bill. \n\n\"Go. Ok, we pay\", said Kancha.\
  \  \n\nAnd there I went, running through the dusty streets of a world that before\
  \ I couldn't even imagine, and now I would never forget. As I looked one last time\
  \ out the window, I saw that smiles persisted against the growing distance between\
  \ us."
