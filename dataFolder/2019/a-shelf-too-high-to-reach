Text: "It dawned at the departure gate how bad the time difference is. It\u2019s not\
  \ an easy difference the time gap from Sydney. It\u2019s tomorrow, 5 hours in the\
  \ past for me and yesterday, 5 hours in the future for her. \n\nI saw mum last,\
  \ the day before. She was a week out of surgery and couldn\u2019t speak. We hadn\u2019\
  t seen each other in 2 years, but we were both leaving. We needed a goodbye. We\
  \ went down to Coogee, her favourite beach; I bought her a milkshake and we sat\
  \ in silence. She asked me questions about the trip, how I had been, and whether\
  \ I\u2019d packed, but none of my answers had any heart. I couldn\u2019t muster\
  \ it, though I was looking at her dying body, a mouth sewn half-shut dribbling some\
  \ caramel mess down her face I could only turn to the sea and smell the salt blow\
  \ off the back of the waves by ear of the seagulls\u2019 barks. I hugged her frail\
  \ body and she took a picture of me in front of my car. I told her I\u2019d be back\
  \ in June but I didn\u2019t believe it and I don\u2019t think she did either. \n\
  \nThat\u2019s how I came to America. Only just having turned from home. I couldn\u2019\
  t take my eyes off Sydney harbour as we flew out of and over the clouds, past the\
  \ bluest of any horizon. I watched until it fully disappeared into fog. I tried\
  \ so desperately to hold it in pictures or words but the turbulence shook my hand\
  \ \u2013 I couldn\u2019t hold a pen. There was no way ridding this feeling of total\
  \ departure. \n\nSan Francisco swallowed me up. Opened its bright guzzling choppers\
  \ and nuzzled me right by the back molars. Stepping off the plane in America for\
  \ the first time\u2026 shook me. I felt exhilarated. There\u2019s real angst. There\u2019\
  s real trouble. \n\nSan Francisco is not a city cast in black and white. It\u2019\
  s on a different spectrum. Bright greens brush burnt orange. Cream caresses brown\
  \ in cowboy boots, tree trunks and executive couches. Grey pink rolls deep. \n\n\
  I don\u2019t feel safe at night. I clutch my bag by me tight and everyone in my\
  \ office works late without pay for fear of loosing it. There\u2019s every kind\
  \ of milk, but Starbucks does whole or non-fat. All or nothing. And nothing is done\
  \ by halves. I found a place online to live, a little artists\u2019 collective in\
  \ the old hippie Haight. We\u2019ve got real characters. Pirates, and drag queens,\
  \ and Poison Ivy\u2019d graduates and I\u2019m lost in this mess of communal cooking\
  \ and endless cuddles, wondering hands and deep interest, teetering on something\
  \ more. The touching tease of closeness\u2026 Warmth opens me up \u2013 America\
  \ holds me in shining embrace. A weeklong haze totally blazed. I don\u2019t think\
  \ I moved. Somewhere in the middle of the movement of light, fabric, weed and Taco\
  \ Bell I was elated with the warmth of that sun and its power to forget some past\
  \ I can\u2019t remember.  \n\nI wake in a tiny room on the top floor of our converted\
  \ convent at the top of the hill. Orange light burns in. Alone and afraid, Saturday\
  \ morning silence breaks me more than any string of words. In this dawn something\
  \ sets \u2013 some click in another universe \u2013 and in this wave of pleasure\
  \ my pain finds its way. \n\nThe friends I made last night are gone. No grumble\
  \ fills the air. I breathe through choked coughs and wander through the halls while\
  \ the radiators whistle. \n\nWithout her space this air runs me dry. It moves fast.\
  \ San Francisco\u2019s walls press on me. Fog rolls over and it rains for weeks\
  \ on end.  Where\u2019d my love go? The city holds me along pink roofs and bay windows.\
  \  But fault line spills and a new home calls out, not yet lived, not yet breathed.\
  \ So I keep running to the home I\u2019ve never known. My rocky California. My house\
  \ of contradictions. \n\nThey run while the earth shakes and my tears leak, cause\
  \ I left my heart in San Francisco on a shelf too high to reach."
