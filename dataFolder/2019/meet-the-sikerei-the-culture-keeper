Text: "\u201CWhy do you want to be a Sikerei?\u201D a question I asked to Aman Godai,\
  \ the youngest Sikerei (Shaman) in the village. \n\nIt was one fine serene late\
  \ afternoon on my 2nd day in the Siberut village.  We usually sat together in UMA\
  \ (the big wooden traditional house), have some chit chat\u2026.relaxing and drinking\
  \ coffee or tea and eat boiled banana or casava.  I heard many young people choose\
  \ not to be a Sikerei. The fact that I got to come face to face with Aman Godai\
  \ as the youngest Sikerei really intriqued me. \u201CI want to be able to protect\
  \ my family especially my Children\u201D he replied with certainty....no doubt,\
  \ his tone and his expression affirmed his life choice. What everybody does not\
  \ know ... that choice does not come without consequences. \n\n\nSiberut located\
  \ in western part of Sumatra, Indonesia, is one of the very little village that\
  \ still keep the traditions from their ancestors. They live in the middle of the\
  \ Jungle, it takes 6 hours ferry ride and 3 hours boat ride and 2 hours trekking\
  \ in the jungle to see them.  Sikerei (Shaman) is the person who have an access\
  \ and able to communicate with the ancestors and the world of good and evil spirits,\
  \ they must seek balance and harmony between the spirit world and the world we live\
  \ in, sometimes they can enter a trance state during a ritual and they can also\
  \ practice healing. This skill can be achieved (not always inherited) by acquiring\
  \ a mentor (older and experienced Sikerei) and go through years of study and practice\
  \ that includes rituals, dances, songs, learn various kind of herbs that can be\
  \ used for healing. The title and the skill that has been granted comes with taboos,\
  \ failure to comply can lead to some serious consequences that can lead to death.\
  \ \n\n\nThe high commitment to serve the society sometimes make them go inside the\
  \ forest even late at night to look for herbs and perform the healing rituals. Being\
  \ sikerei is a one way ticket to a lifetime commitment. After performing the sequence\
  \ of ceremonials to become a Sikerei... they are bound to that title with everything\
  \ else attached to it for a lifetime, the ceremonials is non reversable. \n\n\n\
  It\u2019s not easy being a Sikerei. The requirements, the high responsibility and\
  \ the taboos that must be strictly followed.... all those things plus the inevitable\
  \ changes in the society make Sikerei more hard to find.  Sikerei is not just a\
  \ profession, they preserve the culture, their skill\u2026 not only about herbs\u2026\
  \ also their songs, their dance, their traditional custom will be gone along with\
  \ them. I feel so lucky to be able to meet 11 of them before this profession become\
  \ nothing more than a history."
