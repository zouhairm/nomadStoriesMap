Text: "There\u2019s a park in the town I live and yes apart from the other\u2019s\
  \ it\u2019s beauty is still intact because it\u2019s a secret a well nurtured and\
  \ garnished one. Isn\u2019t it that\_ anything which is unknown has always find\
  \ a way to call that curious child one which won\u2019t settle, one who refuse to\
  \ be bounded by the monotonous cycle of predictability packaged as a life of routine.That\
  \ child will explore twinkle rush and ask.Obviously this can't be done unless you\
  \ go, unless you explore, unless you see touch and ask yourself \"is reality the\
  \ end or just the beginning\". \nFrom the screeching sound and the changing track\
  \ of trains,from the high speed currents running in the streams to the heights where\
  \ my lungs looses the breath.There have been stories and there have been moments\
  \ of complete despair, there has been moments of complete clarity and there have\
  \ been moments to feel nothingness. \nApple,such a sweet and na\xEFve term I do\
  \ admit it\u2019s one of my favourite fruits. When I woke up at the stagnant but\
  \ a station full of ripples, everywhere was excitement, an expression of all the\
  \ chemical reactions your brain doesn\u2019t refuses to make, a small contribution\
  \ in everything open and restricted, dopamine and adrenaline always makes a great\
  \ companion my friend. We were at the transition period of a journey to be proceeded\
  \ by smiles, choirs and forgiveness. We were there at the backdrops of Kalka all\
  \ ready to head towards Shimla, arrived with silent cold legs intruder in the early\
  \ morning, from broad to be measured on the abode of toy trains, ruler of narrow\
  \ gauges. \nTo everyone who hasn\u2019t been, Kalka station is itself a luxury,\
  \ confused with mixed emotions of an ambitious mind & the one filled with down to\
  \ earth strands, a yarn of a precious silk bound to connect several pathways. So\
  \ what do you think sane people does when they reach such a place and yes we are\
  \ on the same page, another social chameleons at there best. Pictures every where,\
  \ retro to create candids, from moonwalks to all the relics, waiting for the Himalayan\
  \ queen to arrive. The mirage of one of the most treasured and engineered journey,\
  \ from hundreds of tunnel and myriad bridges at the height that\u2019s even hard\
  \ to grasp and speculate, god has been a great creator himself. We didn\u2019t had\
  \ a lot of time rushing with vigor we were imbibing every memory of the spring present\
  \ and getting prepared for the things and plans ahead. We does took a small detour\
  \ and yes it\u2019s a privilege just to stand on that land, to feel the fresh air\
  \ and feel the elevation in the path present. Nearby we had our lunch and brought\
  \ warm cloths. Winter has that power to create one of the best ambiance you'll ever\
  \ feel, getting packed and surrounded, to be warm & missing the quilt of childhood\
  \ memories. Mufflers to impress with vibrant hues, classic vintage and modern. The\
  \ never-ending styles of wearing them, from depths of gloves to being careful by\
  \ not leaving any evidence. They have a beautiful church near the station, small\
  \ shops like a complete oasis. Do buy things as up there as prices will never be\
  \ same up high, before we took our toy train and just had swayed away Kalka had\
  \ something extremely precious, circular and an addiction, be careful before proceeding\
  \ do take care of the craved instincts of your tongue. Apples, still can\u2019t\
  \ forget that small round green balls of destruction. You\u2019ll find fruit shops\
  \ near the station only don\u2019t get misguided by the packed and decorated strawberries,\
  \ as exploit will be there madly and patiently waiting for you and before even my\
  \ words could say that don\u2019t doublethink don\u2019t dwell or fling away in\
  \ any senile thought you\u2019re having. Just have firm grip and go for it, take\
  \ a bite and let that juice fill your mouth, let that aura be always around. It\u2019\
  s that perfect wish, one can ever had, say thank you for the shining sun the chilled\
  \ mild gales and the beauty around, as even if you don\u2019t your cheeks and lips\
  \ are already doing that dance."
