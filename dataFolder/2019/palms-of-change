Text: "With the weight of the community on my shoulders, I rose eagerly from the ground,\
  \ determined to make an everlasting impression. As I leapt onto my feet the ground\
  \ shook beneath me creating an orange hurricane of dirt rising like a fiery phoenix.\
  \ My feet were feathers in the wind freely gliding in the humid breeze and flickering\
  \ beneath the low-lying palms. As I sped past the authority figures of the facility,\
  \ their mouths were wide-open in shock and their eyes were fixated on my actions.\
  \ Was I doing something wrong? \n\nI feared the worst, isolated in a place a long\
  \ way from home.\n\nThe day had arrived to depart the comfortable, clean and prosperous\
  \ western world and plunge into the chaotic, noisy and unfamiliar streets of Southeast\
  \ Asia.\n\nWithin seconds all my senses had sprung to life, the urban paths were\
  \ populated with relentless vendors selling insidious insects, glowing gadgets and\
  \ suffocating spices. Swarms of motorcycles and Tuk Tuks created clouds of gritty\
  \ pollution whilst discordant advertisements blared through the rambunctious loud\
  \ speakers.\n\nAmid the populated bustling streets, there was a generation of people\
  \ absent from society. Remnants of an unspeakable mass genocide could still be seen\
  \ in the survivors as they walked the streets aimlessly, scared, shattered and shaken;\
  \ not knowing if they\u2019ll ever see their separated loved one again.\n\nIn four\
  \ years, nearly three million innocent Cambodians were mercilessly executed at the\
  \ cowardly hands of the Khmer Rouge. As the number of displaced members of families\
  \ increased the more prevalent orphanages became in the fractured country.\n\nMy\
  \ responsibility in Cambodia were recognized as the countries history became known\
  \ to me, I began volunteering at the Rainbow Orphanage, constructing new structures\
  \ and working in difficult conditions without protective equipment and modern tools.\n\
  \nAlthough the days were filled with immense labor the evenings were filled with\
  \ lively games of communal volleyball as our spirits were lifted when the children\
  \ would return to the orphanage joining the festivities as the red sun would dip\
  \ below the distant rice fields.\n\nNoticing one of the younger orphaned sitting\
  \ isolated in the sand I asked the orphanage carers why he wasn\u2019t interacting\
  \ in the activities. After learning about his heartbreaking background from the\
  \ carers and discovering that he has never participated nor smile in his time at\
  \ the orphanage, I knew I had to help him escape from the fear, anxieties and sadness\
  \ that surrounded him.\n\nWith the weight of expectations on my shoulders, I took\
  \ the responsibility to try and get him involved. Wanting to be left alone, I thought\
  \ all hope was lost. In a last-ditch effort, I bowed my head into the sand gesturing\
  \ a friendly piggy back ride. Eventually I felt his weight on my shoulders. As I\
  \ leapt onto my feet the ground shook beneath me creating an orange hurricane of\
  \ dirt rising like a fiery phoenix. My feet were feathers in the wind freely gliding\
  \ in the humid breeze and flickering beneath the low-lying palms. As I sped past\
  \ the carers, their mouths were wide-open in shock and their eyes were fixated on\
  \ my actions. Preparing for the worst outcome, I heard laughter coming from up above\
  \ me, the unthinkable had happened.\n\nBefore I could blink the entire population\
  \ of the orphanage were chasing us playfully through the buildings, between the\
  \ towering palms and like a wind of change, his laughter lifted everyone\u2019s\
  \ spirits in that very moment we all felt like we had found home.\n\nWith a heavy\
  \ heart the time had come to leave this beautiful community that had touched me\
  \ in such a short period of time. As I travelled through the vibrant countryside,\
  \ the communities I passed through were filled with houses that lacked material\
  \ possessions yet the families despite their situations were the happiest people\
  \ I had ever came across. In this moment I realized that life isn\u2019t about materialistic\
  \ value but rather valuing the people in your life that love you for who you are\
  \ and would sacrifice anything to ensure your happiness.\n\nIn this community where\
  \ love was reciprocated to every person, I truly felt a true sense of belonging."
