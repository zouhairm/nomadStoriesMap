Text: "\u201CThe Cliffs can be very windy,\u201D said our tour guide. \u201CYou\u2019\
  ll see two dirt paths: the path to the left has a fence to keep you away from the\
  \ edge of the cliffs; the path to the right doesn\u2019t. It might not have as great\
  \ of a view, but I\u2019d recommend taking the path on the left just to be safe.\u201D\
  \n\nI had been traveling on the left path for my entire life. It was time to try\
  \ the right path. \n\nLike a boat being jostled by waves, the tour bus rocked side-to-side\
  \ with every Irish pebble strewn along the narrow roads between Galway and the Cliffs\
  \ of Moher. Sheep dotted the untamed landscape and munched grass on steep ledges,\
  \ the spray-painted Xs standing out like wild tattoos in their thick ivory wool.\
  \ Fields of the deepest green I\u2019d ever seen were divided into a checkerboard\
  \ pattern by ancient walls of crumbling stones. \n\nI had been dreaming of visiting\
  \ the Cliffs of Moher ever since I tacked the National Geographic Ireland calendar\
  \ to the wall of my new apartment. Emerging from a six-year relationship, I had\
  \ been grappling with how to exist in the world alone. How do you find yourself\
  \ again when your identity has been interwoven with someone else\u2019s for so long?\
  \ I\u2019d discovered that I\u2019d stayed on a familiar, safe path instead of crossing\
  \ the fence and peering over the edge into the unknown. Now I wanted more. The Cliffs\
  \ of Moher. \n\nIn July of 2015, I flew to London to begin my six-week adventure:\
  \ I performed on stage at Shakespeare\u2019s Globe during an educational program,\
  \ Irish-danced on the sticky hardwood floors of O\u2019Neill\u2019s in Dublin, and\
  \ climbed the basalt columns of Giant\u2019s Causeway in Northern Ireland. \n\n\
  These adventures and new people indulged my extroverted cravings; yet in the moments\
  \ when I was not socializing, I still felt alone, an aching searching for someone\
  \ or something to put me at ease. \n\nThe tour bus made a last dramatic lurch, turned\
  \ a corner, and the world opened before me. \n\nAs an English teacher, I have never\
  \ had a head for numbers. I\u2019d researched the cliffs and knew that they stretched\
  \ along the Atlantic Coast for five miles, sitting an impressive 702 feet above\
  \ the water. Walking onto the Cliffs of Moher, however, proved that numbers cannot\
  \ capture the sheer size and emotional impact of a place. \n\nWithout a visible\
  \ end-point, the cliffs stretched to my left and hazily merged with the sky in the\
  \ distance. Standing on the gravel pathway, I peered over the edge to admire the\
  \ layer-cake cliffs of soft green grass mixed with light-brown sandstone and dark\
  \ shale. Delicate yellow and white wildflowers rebelliously sprouted all along the\
  \ cliff\u2019s edge.\n\nAs I wandered along the cliffs, breathing in the unrivaled\
  \ joy of finally arriving at my destination, it hit me: \n\nWhat if I\u2019m the\
  \ one I\u2019m searching for?\n\nI stopped walking and stood still as the words\
  \ washed over me, calming my loneliness and yearning. Somehow, the vastness of these\
  \ cliffs unlocked a mental vastness that stretched my typical perception of the\
  \ world.\n\nWe are told that fulfillment can be attained by finding \u201Cthe one,\u201D\
  \ but what if our search for another person neglects the person we are already with:\
  \ ourselves? What if the most important relationship of your life is the one you\
  \ have with yourself? It is ironic that I embarked on my six-week adventure in the\
  \ hopes of forming new friendships, yet the ultimate relationship that I discovered\
  \ was the one I have with myself.  \n\nFour years later, I find it interesting that\
  \ this revelation came in the form of a question instead of a declarative statement,\
  \ such as \u201CI\u2019m the one I\u2019m searching for.\u201D This insight was\
  \ framed with the powerful phrase, \u201CWhat if?\u201D These two words contain\
  \ the infinite potential of travel: when we embark on a trip, nothing is decided.\
  \ What we search for is not necessarily what we will find. Yet the external landscape\
  \ of every trip -- the people, the places -- reshapes the landscape of who we are.\
  \ We return home irrevocably and unpredictably changed \u2026 until our next trip\
  \ when we again ask ourselves, \u201CWhat if?\u201D"
