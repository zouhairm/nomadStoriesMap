Text: "Roots.\nWhat is the true meaning of this word? \n\nWe wander through days and\
  \ skies in a quest for something that only can be found in the depth of our hearts,\
  \ our souls. \n\"Roots\".\n\n20.15.1\n\nAlone for the first time, on a plane, on\
  \ my way to the land of jasmin, green tea and bright sunny beaches. \n\nThe land\
  \ of my ancestors, the old veiled women, family branches, dream-long summer vacations\
  \ and olive oil hair masks was calling my name beneath the clouds I was peering\
  \ into from my small window. \n\nExpectations, ambitions, disappointments, crushes,\
  \ heartbreaks, relationships, friendships, passions, tears, fights... It was all\
  \ ahead of me, all written there, in that moment, in the very first moment I laid\
  \ my eyes upon Tunis. \n\nI obviously had no clue, but I can still recall, loud\
  \ and clear, the feeling of fullness that exploded in my heart when I asked myself:\n\
  \"Are you ready?\"\n\n\n20.15.2\n\n\"You really need to get over him, I'm telling\
  \ you.\"  She's right, but still, I know we still could be couple goals. \nCome\
  \ on, he looks like James Dean skater version and I am more like a crazy artistic\
  \ loud italian girl with a Frida Kahlo kinda vibe (that was just a phase, no worries,\
  \ I got cured).\n\"Yes, but I need to understand why he doesn't want me, I mean,\
  \ we had a day-long date! What could have possibly gone wrong? Was it something\
  \ I said? Something I did? I'm so confused.\" \nI was ignoring my exams and study\
  \ duties for that boy and, little confession, I was enjoying it. \nHave you ever\
  \ had that unexpected, flirty wavy wind blowing through your hair while walking\
  \ past your crush and all you wanted in that moment was just to astonish him and\
  \ to feel adored for a second? Well, I had that and it was gloriously fatal because,\
  \ as a capable-of-trascendence romantic, I thought that that was the musical kind\
  \ of entrance of true-love in my life, and I went full Arctic Monkeys on it. \n\n\
  I didn't know tunisian young males could be so cool. \n\n\n20.16.1\n\nAn year has\
  \ passed now and sometimes, when I put on that \"homesick\" playlist I get the the\
  \ nostalgic thoughts, start to text my italian friends, stalking them on social\
  \ media, plotting against their new friendships and all that... you know. \nI was\
  \ expecting these grey days to come. \nBeing away for so long has put me in a strange\
  \ position; while I'm away from that daily mondanity I used to live in back in Italy,\
  \ here in Tunis I am seen as a \"passenger\". No one has ever addressed me as a\
  \ local, even if I share language, origin and blood with them. \nAlways a passenger.\
  \ I like it, sometimes. When that aura of beauty and sadness that is wrapped into\
  \ every traveller's heart spreads its powers and shows me reasons and arguments\
  \ in favour of the definition of a \"passenger\". \n\nDo something for me. Put on\
  \ \"Passenger\" by Iggy Pop. \nYou can continue reading this later. \n\n\n20.17\n\
  \nA sunray hits my notebook, the avory/beigy paper prays for my black pen to scribble\
  \ some images on its back, but I'm going to need one last moment to visualize them\
  \ clearly and to hold back the emotions flooding inside of me. \n\"It's too early\"\
  \ I keep repeating to myself. \"Too early, I need more, I want more.\"\n\nI feel\
  \ like I still haven't found what I was looking for.\n\nHow many sunsets am I losing?\
  \ How many smiles not capturing? How many laughs? How many \"mlawi sandwiches\"\
  \ am I not sharing? \nAnd what about the friends I have made here? \nIs it all over?\
  \ \n\nAirports always give me infinite questions, filled with doubts, regrets and\
  \ hopes. \n\n\"It was completely worth it though.\" \n\nIn a blink of an eye I flashbacked\
  \ to the first day, the first person I met, the first boyfriend I had there, the\
  \ art academy, drawing in the park, me drunk in the streets learning how to skate,\
  \ my failures and wins. \n\nAll wrapped in the unmistakable parfume of pure jasmin.\n\
  \n\nP.S. Four years later, I'm still wondering what went wrong with that James Dean\
  \ skater boy."
