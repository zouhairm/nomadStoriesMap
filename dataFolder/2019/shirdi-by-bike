Text: "IFERNWEH\n\nShirdi, by Bike\nBy Rahul Mahajan\tin Journey\ton November 29,\
  \ 2018\n\nJust a random thought in mind to travel and decision of traveling to Shirdi\
  \ came over. With only 12Hrs of limited time, decided to cover 400 km. Pune to Shirdi\
  \ is an approximate distance of 192 Km by road. As an first bike trip it was a challenge\
  \ to be accepted to ride for 400km in a day.\n\nWith all anxiety, we started at\
  \ 11:00 AM in morning, that was a late start but made it best possible managing\
  \ our office hours. The first 120Km we made an one shot run which made us then stop\
  \ to a magnificent road side restaurant. The shining sun and the cold winter breeze\
  \ made an empty tummy a call for food, the highway provide us with the mouthwatering\
  \ Misal Pav made in typical Maharastrian way, followed by the Tea to make our journey\
  \ numinous. An 30 Minute or rest made our body ready for the next 80Km to go, the\
  \ road side beauty the lush green fileds, the carts carrying bundle of sugarcane,\
  \ the devotee\u2019s rally, made our drive to a cloud nine.\n\nThe vibes of Shirdi,\
  \ started lushing when it was 3:00 In afternoon and soon we reached the temple area,\
  \ the crowd, the enchanting prayers, the smell of flowers made us mesmerized in\
  \ the heal of God. Finding our way out to the temple entrance was the bit difficult\
  \ task, but the locals made it easy for us. We were lucky enough to be passed out\
  \ of long queue just with in and hour and was in the main corridor where it the\
  \ idol right in front of us. The beauty of idol made our eyes stuck too and the\
  \ aurora made our heart and mind a set of peace.\n\nAn hour in the area was the\
  \ pacifism we achieved. With the feel of fernweh to place we left the place at 5:00\
  \ PM and started the return journey. It was evening and the sun was on it\u2019\
  s way back to home as we were. The blushing landscape in the heal of sun was the\
  \ beauty on the way back\n\nTraveling back, made us tired as hell, we started at\
  \ 5:30PM and reached halfway to Ahemdnagar, had a stop their to energized us with\
  \ a cup of tea.\n\nTo the last we directly made our way to Pune, making is drove\
  \ to 100Km in the cold night with traffic lights making our face glow and our eyes\
  \ dump, it was a risk traveling in night with a shivering cold, but we made it,\
  \ and reached Pune by 11:00 in Night."
