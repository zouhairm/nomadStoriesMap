Text: "So I\u2019d never really left the country before. I\u2019d been to Canada and\
  \ Puerto Rico and maybe a few other places when I was a child but I\u2019d never\
  \ experienced anything as an adult. So after I finished my master\u2019s program\
  \ and turned my tassel to the left (Just kidding. I didn\u2019t walk. I fled the\
  \ state and never picked up my diploma), I decided that I\u2019d take a little month-long\
  \ trip. I decided upon Barcelona, Spain and one month turned to three.\n\nSpain\
  \ is consistently ranked the top country in the world for the most beautiful men\
  \ and so I made sure my legs were shaven and my eyebrows were on fleek everyday\
  \ just in case.\n\nIt paid off. I got asked out a few times within days. At first\
  \ I thought these Spanish men were a bit cheeky with their 11pm dinner invites but\
  \ that\u2019s just when they eat dinner.\n\nFor my first date, I was invited out\
  \ for wine and tapas by a lovely Catalan gentleman. I told him I\u2019d never had\
  \ Spanish tapas before and he was trying to work on his English so we made a pretty\
  \ good match.\n\nWe walked around Barrio Gotico until we found some hole in the\
  \ wall. We sat, he ordered, we chatted. Then the food came.\n\nI\u2019m not one\
  \ to complain, but I was starving to death. I\u2019m used to waking up at 6am, eating\
  \ breakfast at 7am, then having lunch at 1 and dinner at around 6. In Barcelona,\
  \ I kept missing meals because I just couldn\u2019t manage their schedule. That\
  \ particular day, I missed breakfast because nowhere serves food until 1pm. I then\
  \ tried to get dinner at 6 but everywhere was closed for siesta in my neighborhood.\
  \ The only thing I could get was a bocadillo (a little sandwich) but I was so full\
  \ of bread at that point that I thought I\u2019d be ill. So I was excited to go\
  \ on this date and have this Catalan man show me where and how to eat.\n\nHe ordered\
  \ maybe 10 different things and I waited excitedly, white wine in hand. We got olives,\
  \ croquettes, patatas bravas, calamares, and some grilled vegetables, jamon, and\
  \ I\u2019m forgetting exactly what else. We also got my newest favorite thing: pa\
  \ amb tomaquet. AKA pan con tomate. AKA bread with tomato.\n\nIngredients: bread,\
  \ tomato, oil, salt (optional), garlic (optional too I think)\n\nSo they gave us\
  \ these gigantic pieces of bread that were grilled and a basket of tomatoes. The\
  \ Catalan man told me what to do. So we cut a tomato in half and smashed the tomato\
  \ onto the bread so that all the juice soaked in. And were you expecting more? Because\
  \ that was it. Buen provecho!\n\nI tore through those tapas like it was my first\
  \ meal after a biblical style famine. I was still starving when I was done but I\
  \ was too embarrassed to say so since the Catalan gentleman had been complaining\
  \ he was full even though he was only about 2 tapas deep.\n\nWe paid and left the\
  \ restaurant and my stomach was still rumbling. I didn\u2019t know what to do so\
  \ I just told him the truth after a while and he laughed. I didn\u2019t care if\
  \ he judged me. I\u2019d written him off as a potential future husband earlier in\
  \ the night because he had warned me about how spicy the sauce on the patatas bravas\
  \ was. I then watched him struggle to eat it. I got scared and took the most timid\
  \ bite ever. Until this day, I\u2019m not sure if he was joking. I didn\u2019t taste\
  \ even a hint of spice.\n\nBut anyway, he didn\u2019t live far so he invited me\
  \ up for what he called \u201Csecond dinner\u201D. I waited on his couch while he\
  \ prepared something in the kitchen. He was gone for quite some time and there was\
  \ a nice smell in the air.\n\nBut when he emerged from the kitchen, he was holding\
  \ a plate of toasted bread in one hand and a plate of tomatoes in the other.\n\n\
  I was going to starve to death in Barcelona. That fact became glaringly clear."
