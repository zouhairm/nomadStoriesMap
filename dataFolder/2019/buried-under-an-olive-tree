Text: "Thousands of tiny sheep are running down the tallest mountain-chain somewhere\
  \ over the Georgia Military Road. \u2018That\u2019s why their cheese is so delicious,\
  \ look at them, climbers\u2019 - she says, as our bus takes another dangerously\
  \ sharp turn into the depth of a mountain range, which was colored in the magical\
  \ type of green, the one you only see in a photoshopped reality. Her name is Aliye,\
  \ a Syrian refugee -  her parents rescued her from the warring state when she was\
  \ 16.\nI just met her on the way to see the Gergeti Trinity Church, the royal palace\
  \ of worshippers 10000 feet above the ground in the Caucasian highlands. It was\
  \ built underneath the sky to detect enemies from far away and provide hope for\
  \ warriors by showing them what they are fighting for - the land and the state.\
  \ She was drawn to the church and its artistry infused with the history of a struggle\
  \ for the freedom of the land, where praised Queen Tamara ruled the nation to keep\
  \ their wide mountains intact. With the ancient fruitful ceremonial frescos covering\
  \ it, and our guide citing the scripture and local myths, we were embraced by the\
  \ historical truth of Georgians. \n\u2018Maybe I need to be buried under an olive\
  \ tree, back home, in Syria\u2019 she says, while we stand at one of the oldest\
  \ and most culturally influential churches in the south-east Caucasus. The history\
  \ of the place captures over 4330 liters of blood - the statistic that would be\
  \ too unsettling to hear if we weren\u2019t thinking about the Syrian War today.\
  \ \n\u2018This is beautiful. But it\u2019s never enough because I am not where I\
  \ need to be. Home. Standing on the ground, where my great-grandfather had a beautiful\
  \ olive plantation. I would give up every language I learned and every penny I don\u2019\
  t have just to share the taste of homemade olive oil we were able to serve with\
  \ each meal.\u2019 Honestly, I never really understood the olive oil, but the crunchy\
  \ note of satisfaction in her voice made me believe - yes, it was a good thing,\
  \ that would make me a happy person. We didn\u2019t talk much, but her confession\
  \ was almost cathartic for us. \nThe road home was banned for her, so she tried\
  \ to find a place in the World, where she would belong the same way. Where the dump\
  \ wind infiltrated her lungs at the age of seven, while she was standing at a little\
  \ mountain near her home. \n\u2018There is a balance to the way people live - everything\
  \ is just a handshake away. I now know you, the person who saw the Syrian War, the\
  \ one people in my country think of as impossibly far, happily unreal and honestly\
  \ unimportant. But here you are - and now all them are one step away from tasting\
  \ olives in Syria.\u2019 I say what was on my mind for hours now.\n\u2018You know\
  \ what - it works both ways. Do you realize that? If the bad and the scary is just\
  \ a hud away, then the good is too. So by doing good anywhere, you help people everywhere.\
  \ You teach, right? If your student grows up to be a scientist - you will be the\
  \ part of the success and every person who benefits from that - will be too. The\
  \ hug to determine the life\u2019 she says.\nWe stand here, in the middle of everywhere\
  \ we have ever been to and feel both on top of the world and in the deepest hole.\
  \ We are a part of the blood left on the ground - it gave the world to our minds\
  \ and put the warmth on your feet. As we walked down from the alienation, we left\
  \ the liminality, where everything and nothing was possible. The high of knowing\
  \ and the pain of it broke us down. \nI was not just me, and she was not just her:\
  \ we were put together as one puzzle, where the picture was not at all clear. \n\
  \u2018Give me your address, I will send you a bottle of the freshest olive oil.\
  \ Once I get home\u2019"
