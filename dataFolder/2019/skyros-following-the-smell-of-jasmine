Text: "\u201CJust follow the smell of jasmine\u201D.\n\nSince there are no individual\
  \ names for the snarl of alleys that make up the villages of most Greek islands,\
  \ and my great aunt Anna\u2019s house would hardly make it to Google Maps, I simply\
  \ have to rely on my sense of smell and my mum\u2019s directions. Vague as they\
  \ may sound, they are surprisingly accurate. Strolling around the cobblestone alleys\
  \ of Hora, a village built on the slopes of a hill overlooking the Aegean, I am\
  \ suddenly hit by the soft yet distinctive aroma of Jasminum polyanthum. It is this\
  \ heavenly scent rather than the sight of the white, star-shaped flowers of the\
  \ fragrant climber that awakens childhood memories and emotions. Here I am, a 5-year-old\
  \ boy, playing in my great aunt\u2019s courtyard, whilst she is serving my favourite\
  \ ladopita, bread baked with olive oil, with locally produced sour cheese. Anna,\
  \ now in her late eighties, is sitting in that very courtyard looking exactly the\
  \ same as that summer when I last visited Skyros.\n\nThirty years on, the island\
  \ hasn\u2019t changed much either. Relatively unknown and lucky not to be affected\
  \ by mass tourism, Skyros has managed to preserve its authenticity and traditions\
  \ throughout the years. This makes it an ideal summer destination for those like\
  \ myself who want to escape the crowds of Mykonos, Santorini or Crete. With a yoga\
  \ mat and a notepad in my rucksack, I am here to unwind, relax and enjoy some peace\
  \ and quiet. In fact, the largest and southernmost of the Sporades islands is home\
  \ to Europe's first course-based holiday centre, which now in its 41st year offers\
  \ yoga, health and well-being retreats, but also art and writing courses. Here also\
  \ lies the olive grove where the English poet Rupert Brooke was buried during the\
  \ First World War, when the Tris Boukes bay was used as anchorage for hospital ships\
  \ treating the wounded from Gallipoli. \n\nA century later, the \u201CStatue of\
  \ an Ideal Poet\u201D, erected in memory of the famous Englishman, stands tall high\
  \ above the Mediterranean in a small square that bears his name. Also known as the\
  \ \u201CSquare of Eternal Poetry\u201D, it offers a wonderful view over the sandy\
  \ beaches of Magazia and Molos. I visit the neighbouring archaeological museum with\
  \ finds from the island\u2019s excavation sites dating from the Early Helladic to\
  \ the period of Roman occupation. I smile, as I remember my mum telling me to look\
  \ for Anna no further than among these finds. I walk down to Magazia, where, after\
  \ diving into the deep blue waters, I reward myself with the most famous Skyrian\
  \ dish: astakomakaronada (lobster spaghetti) at Stefano\u2019s seaside tavern. I\
  \ continue to the Greek Orthodox monastery of St George. Dedicated to the patron\
  \ saint of Skyros and proudly overlooking the island, the monastery is located inside\
  \ the Kastro (Castle), a Byzantine fortress originally built to defend against pirate\
  \ attacks, a monk tells me. \n\nOn my way down to Hora, bypassing whitewashed houses\
  \ and funky cocktail bars playing the latest dance hits, I notice a familiar fragrance.\
  \ \u201CThanks, mum,\u201D I whisper. A few moments later, I step inside Anna\u2019\
  s small house. My gaze falls on the traditional wood-carved furniture the island\
  \ is renowned for. Anna proudly shows me her elaborate embroideries, whilst I admire\
  \ the ceramic plates decorating the walls. As she serves me yet another ladopita,\
  \ she asks me if Stefano\u2019s is better than hers. I smile and I promise it won\u2019\
  t take another thirty years till I return to Skyros."
