Text: "I love Williamsburg.\nIt's an amazing district, I love the fact that this trip\
  \ brought me here, to the  buildings made of bricks and to this young, industrial\
  \ mood: it seems that music  follows you everywhere, even noise seems music.\nToday\
  \ I love here more, because I\u2019ve discovered that there\u2019s one of the best\
  \ pancakes' house of NY in the district\_: and I love pancakes. When I arrive there,\
  \ everything looks nice\_: the color is white and green, everything is made of wood,\
  \ everyone is friendly and the taste of fresh eggs is everywhere, and it\u2019s\
  \ delicious. And then the magic touch\_: all tables are covered with white paper\
  \ towels, with a set of colored pencils on it. I mean, when you wait for your breakfast\
  \ you can write, draw, paint. I love this, you can color your hungry.\nSo, when\
  \ I wait for my pancakes \u2013 with true tasty Vermouth sirup - I spend my time\
  \ taking notes on my NY guide book and sketching on the towel. I love to draw my\
  \ personal version of other customers\u2019 face, and I have to admit they\u2019\
  re very funny illustrations indeed. And suddenly I saw him among all other customers\
  \ : he's one of the waiters, and like his mates he's extremely kind with everyone.\
  \ He's dressed very casual, half country half hipster, so quite common in this neighborhood.\
  \ But he also has long dark black hair, and the look of an hawk, very serious and\
  \ wise eyes. Someone I\u2019ve always seen on photos, or at cinema, but never face\
  \ to face\_: he's an original Native American.\nI try to not look at him with that\
  \ creepy way, but it is against my will\_: I\u2019ve always dreamt about the frontier,\
  \ the fields of Midwest, the ancients cultures. And now one of the heroes of my\
  \ fantasy just stand by me. The man can feel my eyes on him, and I'm quite old now\
  \ not to try to turn my eyes somewhere else. So, when he comes close to me and asks\
  \ me if I need something, like more coffee or milk, I can only answer very honestly.\
  \ \xAB\_Bill\_? - I read his name tag - Not at all.... I apologise, but I'm an european\
  \ here, a tourist of course, and well... Are you a Native American\_?\_\xBB. I'm\
  \ scared about the possibility that Billy can be hurt in some way, my question maybe\
  \ is too much direct and not so polite, even if I've been very very sincere in the\
  \ end. But Billy smiles, and says\_: \xAB\_Yes, I'm a Mohawk, we are a lot here\_\
  \xBB.\nBilly is even more kind, and continues to talk to me\_: he tells me about\
  \ the beginning of the last century, when NY dreamt to became a great, huge city\
  \ and needed people full of courage to make this dream come true. So he tells me\
  \ that the Mohawks, proud and strong people, aren't scared about the heights, don't\
  \ feel vertigo, and so are the perfect workers to build skyscrapers, to walk on\
  \ thin laps more close to the sky than to the ground. I start to remember something\
  \ about it, but now, seeing a true Mohawk in front of me, I can see in my mind this\
  \ people walking through the clouds, literally building the city.\nI think about\
  \ the skeleton of the buildings, while I eat a very amazing pancakes, and maybe\
  \ I already know that I'll be here next days, for the pancakes and my new friend\
  \ Billy.\nFinished my breakfast, I walk to the bridge. I have to cross to continue\
  \ my exploration of the Big Apple, following my notes on the guide. But I stop a\
  \ moment, just on this side of the river, to take a look at the skyline on the opposite\
  \ side\_: and just for a second, I can see mohawks flying from a building to another,\
  \ running to the clouds."
