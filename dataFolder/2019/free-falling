Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself walking off the edge of a cliff, again.\
  \  Last time I\u2019d tried that had been 44 years, 4 months and 8 days earlier.\n\
  \nKnowing more now about the risks and rewards of free falling into another place,\
  \ a new adventure, a different life, I leapt anyway. \n\nIn August 1973, while Watergate\
  \ saturated the airwaves, I sailed on the SS France from New York harbor to Southhampton.\
  \  The single rope I held onto was loosely tied to a dancer who\u2019d asked me\
  \ to continue my work as a videographer in her new training program in London. I\
  \ planned to be away for 6 months. \n\nThe work was intermittent, but rooted me\
  \ deeply enough in the damp English soil to pull me back each time I ventured out\
  \ on solo travels through Europe and into the Middle East. When I finally returned\
  \ to the US, over 6 years had gone by.\n\nWith no fixed abode, no cell phone, GPS\
  \ or email, I\u2019d set out to discover a new world. \n\nPeople told me I was brave.\
  \ One friend said she envied my fearlessness. But I wasn\u2019t fearless. I was\
  \ always scared, of everything and everyone.  Fear was the air I breathed, the ground\
  \ my feet hit each morning when I awoke.\n \nEventually I would understand how fear\
  \ blocked me from discerning what was actually dangerous from everything else. \
  \ Because I couldn\u2019t differentiate, I did things that others were afraid to\
  \ do, that made them consider me brave. \n\nMy work evolved into making social documentaries\
  \ with outliers in a London where tourists don\u2019t go.  At night, I experimented\
  \ with feeling my fear.  A combination of events culminating with Britain\u2019\
  s national security police mistaking me for a terrorist scared me silly and marked\
  \ the beginning of the end of my great adventure. It was time to come home, right\
  \ before New Year\u2019s 1980.\n\nMy craving for open-ended travel re-emerged as\
  \ I prepared to retire from work that was draining my life force.   A 6-month journey\
  \ to South America, beginning right after New Year\u2019s 2018, seemed like just\
  \ the ticket to bookend my earlier venture.\n\nI loosely tied my rope to a group\
  \ of digital nomads, mostly around the age I was in the 1970s.  Before long, I had\
  \ to accept that traveling solo is my truer calling.  Equipped with laptop and cell\
  \ phone to keep me connected, I proceeded, over the next several months, to fall\
  \ in love with places I went and people I met while savoring the distinct flavors\
  \ of Argentina, Chile, Peru, Columbia and Ecuador. There were times when I was a\
  \ little scared, but not many.  I\u2019m better now at discerning what is dangerous.\
  \ I stayed out of Venezuela.\n\nMy second free-fall ended just shy of 5 months after\
  \ it began.  Without the same stamina at 70 that I\u2019d had at 25, and without\
  \ the same insatiable appetite for living on the edge, I retired my back pack, at\
  \ least for awhile.\n\nStill, people told me I was brave because I do things that\
  \ would be brave for them to do. Free falling out of the comforts of home comes\
  \ partly from excitement at the call of an unknown place, partly from delight in\
  \ bucking what tired conventions suggest I\u2019m supposed to do (whether getting\
  \ married and settling down in my 20s or retiring to a smaller life in my 70s),\
  \ and partly because, apparently, I still need to scare myself a little. \n\nTraveling\
  \ in South America prompted feelings of delight, disappointment, excitement, frustration,\
  \ invigoration and fatigue. I often experienced the simple joy of just being alive.\
  \ But I didn\u2019t feel brave.\n\nI felt brave in 1970-something when I let layers\
  \ of fear hidden in my body come into my awareness, when I allowed the waves of\
  \ nausea, the clammy sweat, the certainly that I would suffocate as I made myself\
  \ breathe through overwhelming sensations that surfaced when I decided to consciously\
  \ feel my fear. \n\nI feel brave not only when I leap into dark, unknown places\
  \ of my inner world but also when I tell stories that show me for who I am as I\
  \ travel through the outer world."
