Text: "If I was asked what I was expecting of my trip to Toronto I would say \"no\
  \ much but what I already had seen\". I had been in Toronto seven years ago and\
  \ I got to discover a little bit of how summer in Canada is. The temperatures were\
  \ high and I got to know a lot of different places, specially in terms of natural\
  \ beauty. It was a special trip, for sure, and I was extremely happy to be travelling\
  \ abroad for the second time at the age 15.\n\nLittle did I know that I would get\
  \ to learn a lot more about the Canadian culture and even have some bonus when I\
  \ travelled to Toronto for the second time. This time, I decided to experience its\
  \ winter. \"Are you crazy? You are from Brazil, you won't get to get out of your\
  \ hotel because of the cold weather\", are some of the phrases I heard when I told\
  \ to a couple of friends that I was going to be in Canada in December and in January.\
  \ I won't say they were completely wrong. The temperatures were strict, but to be\
  \ honest that is one of the things that motivated me to go out and say \"let's see\
  \ what Toronto offers!\". \n\nTo be honest, I couldn't say in less than 700 words\
  \ what Toronto has to offer and more than that: what Toronto offered me! Summing\
  \ up, I met really nice people (including a pop idol who is currently touring worldwide),\
  \ got to learn about Canada's history, and obviously learnt how canadians are able\
  \ to survive to that cold (spoiler: a lot of Tim Hortons' french vanilla is needed).\
  \ \n\nI had never seen snow before and I couldn't say that I didn't seem to be a\
  \ 5-year-old kid when I woke up and everything was covered of snow! I cannot remember\
  \ having had a happiest day than that one, actually. \n\nAt some point of the trip,\
  \ I was so excited for being there that I started waking up at 7am simply to enjoy\
  \ the day the more thay I could. My family used to stay at the hotel, sleeping,\
  \ while I went to different places by myself carrying a Canon, so I could register\
  \ everything that touched my soul (I can say now that I took over 4,000 picures!).\
  \ It was on those moments when I met some really nice and kind people. Some of them\
  \ told me a little about their routines and how this winter was one of the least\
  \ cold ever. There was a woman who told me I look like her niece and then we talked\
  \ for like an hour, simply sharing some basic stuff but it was a super cool moment\
  \ for me. I spent so much time on the streets that I memorized the routes to a lot\
  \ of places, and even the name of the streets and of the subway stations.\n\nI don't\
  \ think it's really possible to compare the time I spent in Toronto in 2011 and\
  \ then in 2018/2019. But if I was to do it, I would start saying how grateful I\
  \ am for having had the chance to visit such a multicultural city. Toronto's population\
  \ is composed by over 60% non-canadian people, mainly indians, chinese and british\
  \ people, so I couldn't not mention how incredible was the opportunity to be close\
  \ to their cultures as well. As a 21-year-old law student, I know that when I was\
  \ there for the first time I wasn't mature enough to value this experience, and\
  \ I'm glad to know that now I am. \n\nI am sure that I would go back there as much\
  \ time as possible. Toronto is a city for all ages, and your perspective of it changes\
  \ depending on that. \n\nThe image of CN Tower (honestly, my favorite part of Toronto)\
  \ still immediatly shows up in my mind everytime I think about happiness."
