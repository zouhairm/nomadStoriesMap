Text: "\"SEEK FOR the LOST\" implys something lost but i don't know, even we dont't\
  \ know at all. Finding the lost means somewhat mystery or dejavu would be poping\
  \ out in one alone travelling. Starting a journey is not easy for one who has not\
  \ gone through anything on one's own, especially those ones in my living surroundings.\
  \ Humans are the one kind can't live without community, without familys, without\
  \ friends, even sometimes strangers who will provide comfort. \nWhen I or someone\
  \ else put, abandoned by somewhere there is no connection before, which meant a\
  \ lot for one's existing gaining, experience, to some extent, they might be the\
  \ conflicts, causing hatred and denial, or just all surprise and pleasure. As I\
  \ know Portugal, the intriguing scenery is Sagres, Cabo da Roca, still relatively\
  \ less interest to most travellers, where I think more suitable for the travel story.\n\
  For these reasons, I will start the travel story in five parts.\n1. lost - firstly\
  \ come somewhere always have issues in fitting, that is a lost.\n2.learn to fit\
  \ - then struggle to fit in with the surroundings.\n3.seem to lost - when everythins\
  \ is like to settle down, being lost again for what I am supposed to be.\n4.find\
  \ oneself - now then start the finding self journey \n5.everything is gone - too\
  \ insisting on to lost, too much push oneself into sometimes means lose one's wide\
  \ angle for the world.\n\nActurally, this is one's own finding self journey through\
  \ travelling. If I am not fixed in our original life, what would i be? The question\
  \ linger in my mind by times, i can still not figure out."
