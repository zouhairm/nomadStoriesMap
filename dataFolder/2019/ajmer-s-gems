Text: "One winter morning, we, Faizal and myself, boarded a train from the pink city,\
  \ Jaipur, to Ajmer. It was almost noon when we reached. We hired a cycle rickshaw\
  \ to the Dargah which was hardly 2 kms away. The rickshaws dropped us some way ahead\
  \ and from there we walked towards the shrine. The lane with shops on either side\
  \ selling sweets and offerings to Dargah, was crowded and everyone seemed to be\
  \ moving in the same direction. There was a burst of colors around and we moved\
  \ ahead, in reverie.\n\nAjmer is a pilgrim town in the Indian state of Rajasthan.\
  \ This is where the Dargah Ajmer Sharif of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, the Sufi saint,\
  \ is situated, where pilgrims from all faiths throng all around the year.\n\nAs\
  \ we turned into another lane, we could see the main entrance of the Dargah. The\
  \ view was mesmerising, a colourful, crowded lane, ending at a majestic door and\
  \ a hill behind with a mosque built atop. \n\nFaizal contacted a person named Abdul\
  \ Rahman, referred to him by one of his friends. Mr. Rahman informed us that the\
  \ Dargah will be re-opened only at 3 pm and we may finish our lunch by then and\
  \ meet him at Buland Darwaza, which is the main entrance of the Dargah, by 2.30pm.\
  \ We had lunch in one of the numerous eateries around and went to meet this person.\
  \ He informed us that bags are not allowed and hence we may deposit them at his\
  \ place. We walked in a single file through narrow alleys, lined with lodges. Rahman\
  \ seemed to be the owner of one of the lodges. We left our bags and footwear there\
  \ and started our walk back to the Dargah. \n\nMr. Rahman had briefed us about the\
  \ entry procedure before we started out. We gave him the money for the \u201Cphool\
  \ and chadar\u201D, the flower and cloth offering in a basket. We were to enter\
  \ through the side entrance, do the ablutions, collect our basket and follow him\
  \ into the main shrine. We did as instructed; entered the crowded shrine, holding\
  \ the baskets tightly above our heads. The phool and chadar was handed over to Mr.\
  \ Rahman, who now was on the other side, along with those who were accepting the\
  \ offerings. He asked us to pray and submit the flowers to the Sufi saint with belief\
  \ that all our prayers will be answered.\n\nWe were pushed out of the shrine by\
  \ the moving crowd. To our surprise, we saw Mr. Rahman waiting for us outside the\
  \ shrine. He took us to a huge utensil in one corner of the courtyard. It is called\
  \ Deg, used for cooking the sacred food or Tabarruks. \n\nThe Dargah complex have\
  \ multiple constituents like tombs, the main shrine, courtyards, Buland Darwaza,\
  \ Jama Masjid, Mehfilkhana etc. The architecture is Mughal style, being built in\
  \ the 13th century. There are Qawwalis every evening at the Mehfilkhana, sung by\
  \ qawwals who visit the Dargah.\n\nAs we returned, after collecting our bags, we\
  \ walked through the lanes surrounding the Dargah and tasting the local food, sweets\
  \ and chai.\n\nWe approached a taxi stand and as we spoke to them, I found a wall\
  \ behind, representing a bygone era. I decided to explore and walked around the\
  \ wall to find a flight of steps leading to a majestic archway.  This, the taxi\
  \ guy, informed, is the Adhai-din-ka-jhonpra. This is the ruin of a mosque, which\
  \ was built in two and a half days and hence the name. The mosque is surrounded\
  \ by a wall having seven arches, with Arabic inscriptions on them. The structure\
  \ showcases earliest of Indo-Islamic architecture, built in yellow sandstone. Ruins\
  \ though, the place had a charm and was less crowded.\n\nWe returned from Ajmer,\
  \ happy to have visited an unexpected monument, a place we did not know of before.\
  \ I was most happy to have learned a slice of history, in a place where I did not\
  \ expect."
