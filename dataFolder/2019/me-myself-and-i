Text: "Being alone never bothered me. But now I do consider the benefits of having\
  \ some company; when I\u2019m lost, for example. \n\nI was in Vancouver for a couple\
  \ weeks, staying with a local family. It was past midnight. Some friends and I had\
  \ just left a concert at the humongous Stanley Park. \n\nNo one ever accused me\
  \ of being impractical so I said good night to them decided to take a \u201Cshortcut\u201D\
  . On my own. Bad idea. My place was far from everyone else\u2019s so I had to leave\
  \ the same way I got there, alone. \n\nMe, being me, had only brought my cell phone,\
  \ my bus card, my keys, and my ID. So no bag, no money, no MAP. Smart\u2026\n\n\
  I thought streets ran all the way down to the end of the city. So I figured that\
  \ if I walked long enough in the direction that I needed to, I would get to the\
  \ street where my bus passed; buses ran until 2 am. I had enough time. Or so I thought\u2026\
  \n\nI blame my age for risking my life in the middle of the night, a woman, alone,\
  \ in the dark, with a Mexican cell phone (no service). Had I not been in such a\
  \ safe city, this could\u2019ve ended a lot differently. \n\nI was heading straight,\
  \ I should be hitting that street any time but for some strange reason, I never\
  \ did. It was getting late, it was pitch black and my cell phone was burning hot\
  \ from using the flash so much. I don\u2019t get why the neighborhoods there are\
  \ SO dark! A church was ahead of me, locked of course. Jesus, where are you when\
  \ I need you?\n\nDesperation began to crawl up my legs or, wait, no! It\u2019s a\
  \ raccoon! They were everywhere. I swear there is a plague. \n\nI was starting to\
  \ panic\u2026 No, there\u2019s no need to worry, everything will be fine, all I\
  \ need to do is keep walking\u2026 keep on walking\u2026 or stop? And get eaten\
  \ by raccoons? No, thanks!\n\nI had to keep moving, sooner or later I was bound\
  \ to hit a big road. \nI was attentively looking at the street names using my flash.\
  \ None were familiar. \n\nDark thoughts crossed my mind. What if some creep stalked\
  \ me, kidnapped me, hurt me? No! Stop! Focus. \nYou\u2019re fine. I\u2019m fine.\
  \ We\u2019re fine. Me, myself\u2026 and I, and the raccoons. \n\nI started hearing\
  \ cars, and sounds, strange sounds, music? I saw lights ahead and bolted towards\
  \ them. YES! A boulevard! Or whatever. There were many stores and it was well lit,\
  \ cars drove by, a few people were walking around. \n\nWait\u2026 something\u2019\
  s off, what kind of a street is this?\nWhy does it smell like pot?\nWhy is everyone\
  \ dressed so weird?\nWHERE AM I?! \n\nI just want to go home\u2026 I was even more\
  \ scared now surrounded by a bunch of people than I was back in the darkness surrounded\
  \ by raccoons.\n\nDAVIE ST. said the sign\u2026 never heard of it\u2026 later on\
  \ I found out that that was the famous Gay Street. I should feel safe, but everything\
  \ so confusing: the drugs, the colors, the bizarre outfits, the crazy stores (all\
  \ closed by the way).\n\nLuckily I found a Starbucks (also closed) and stood on\
  \ the curb trying to connect to the Wi-Fi to spot myself on the map. \nGreat. The\
  \ street I needed to hit did not run all the way to where I was when I first started\
  \ walking. Sigh. Genius. \n\nI now had to walk the same distance but in the other\
  \ direction. I had around 30 minutes left before the last bus passed and now my\
  \ phone was dead.\nI walked and walked and sometimes ran. \n\nI heard some buses\
  \ coming, not mine, but it just made me all the more anxious. I wanted to be home.\
  \ I wanted my mom, but she was countries away. I would never tell her this story\
  \ though. She would ground me.\n\nI started running and as I got to the corner,\
  \ the bus arrived. I cried, tears of joy and relief. I got on the bus, headed home\
  \ and never dared venture like that since."
