Text: "We go over what feels like the hundredth bump in the road, and no that is not\
  \ a metaphor, this is just a dirt track. We have been going for about an hour, time\
  \ ticks by but the anticipation remains intense, what else will we see today? And\
  \ more importantly, will we survive to tell the tale?\n\nThe sun begins to set,\
  \ soaking the Western Cape of South Africa in an enchanting golden hue, I feel peacefully\
  \ isolated from society. People crammed in cities like sardines, frantically rushing\
  \ from one place to the next, seem worlds apart from this moment. Everything about\
  \ this experience so far is a huge contradiction down to the fact that I am sat\
  \ in a truck full of strangers, who I met only a week ago but feel so connected\
  \ to. We don\u2019t know each other but we all share the same mentality of wanting\
  \ to give back to nature by volunteering on a game reserve. I begin to realise that\
  \ the world I am in now is much more real than the one I have always known, one\
  \ that has been untouched by humans: the raw earth beneath the truck tyres, the\
  \ unpruned trees, the random spattering of boulders. It is perfectly imperfect.\
  \ \n\nIt seems that our game drive is over for today as we speed back to the reserve\
  \ after a morning of road maintenance which some might call manual labour! The back-breaking\
  \ work is so worth it for moments like this; the cool wind against my arm resting\
  \ on the side of the truck with the light glow of warmth against my face from the\
  \ last rays of the setting sun. \n\nSuddenly, we come to an abrupt stop, knowing\
  \ what that means we turn to our ranger, Ali-G (not your average ranger!), who points\
  \ to the other side of the grassy valley. Of course none of us can see what he is\
  \ so excited about, the rangers should be an attraction themselves at a game reserve\
  \ as not just their knowledge but their eyesight is beyond belief. He explains that\
  \ the small grey boulder just visible on a background of green bushes is actually\
  \ a rhino! Our initial stunned silence erupts into a mass of excited chatter which\
  \ awakens the entire valley that only moments ago had been settling down for the\
  \ night. Off we head, towards that unusually active boulder and the silence returns\
  \ as we all sit with eagerness, our eyes locked on our new found destination, determined\
  \ to make it to the other side before the \u2018boulder\u2019 rolls down the hill\
  \ out of sight.\n\nThe engine clicks off and the silence echoes across the valley,\
  \ the only noise is the quiet crunching of dirt under the rhinos feet. A tiny sparrow\
  \ perching on this majestic beast is the perfect juxtaposition and only emphasises\
  \ his sheer strength and size, yet there is a gracefulness about him. The way his\
  \ ears flop gently back and forth to move the slightest touch of a fly off his skin\
  \ shows beneath his hard exterior an acute sensitivity.\n\nThe red tinge of the\
  \ sunset on the horizon tells us that we can\u2019t stay in this wonderland forever\
  \ and as the rhino turns its back on us reaching for a leaf, it\u2019s time for\
  \ us to turn our backs on him. We sit back in our seats, still silence reigns as\
  \ the image of this incredible creature lies imprinted in our minds. The cough of\
  \ the engine is like a slap in the face, shocking us back to reality, it splutters\
  \ and wheezes but never gives a full breath \u2013 the engine won\u2019t start!\
  \ As Ali-G desperately tries again, all eyes turn nervously to the rhino, the serene\
  \ image we had just witnessed is wiped from our memory \u2026 the noise of the struggling\
  \ engine has awoken the beast within. The rhino is face-to-face with the front of\
  \ the truck ready for a stand-off, grinding his foot against the floor, throwing\
  \ up dust all around, shaking his head violently from side to side and snorting\
  \ aggressively in disgust. \nIn the chaos I can\u2019t help but think to myself,\
  \ is this human nature or human vs nature?"
