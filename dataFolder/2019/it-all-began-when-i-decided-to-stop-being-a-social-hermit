Text: "It all began when I decided to stop being a social hermit. \n\nThis past December\
  \ was my first grown up semi-independent, while still a dependant and living with\
  \ my parents\u2019 vacation. Yay! I went to so many different and beautiful places\
  \ in South Africa, each one that left me with a unique experience with almost every\
  \ place I visited. All because I decided to change my mind-set.\nI sat down with\
  \ myself and thought long and hard on the person I wanted to become one day. Did\
  \ I always want to be the girl that is too shy to meet new people? Or did I finally\
  \ want to conquer my fear of social anxiety around new faces.\nContrary to how I\
  \ may come across to you if you ever meet me in person, I actually like having conversations.\
  \ I just can\u2019t start any. I stumble over my words, my palms sweat and I forget\
  \ every single question in the world except\u2026 \u201CWhat\u2019s your favourite\
  \ colour?\u201D Don\u2019t worry I cringe internally every single time I say it\
  \ out load to another person. I then decided, what the hay (I don\u2019t swear.\
  \ #dontjudgeme), let\u2019s just force myself into as many new situations as possible\
  \ with new people. No matter how much I slightly start to hyperventilate. As it\
  \ turns out I actually have valuable opinions and a level head. Yay!\n I am now\
  \ about to tell you about one of the many social interactions I found myself in\
  \ during my weirdly festive season. \nMy family loves the beach and my parents had\
  \ decided to take us to Durban for a week over Christmas. We had been there for\
  \ a week and I usually stay up late, but I was sharing a room with my younger sisters.\
  \ Both teenagers who love their sleep. Being the amazing big sister and book nerd\
  \ they know and love, I let them sleep in peace while I went down to relax by the\
  \ pool and read. It was the night the night before we were set to leave and of course\
  \ it was warm out that night so there were actually a few guest sitting out by the\
  \ pool. I of course completely ignored them, having forgotten about my new mind-set\
  \ to be social. Eventually people started to leave as it got later into the night\
  \ and I was alone with my book once again.\n Out of nowhere a guy comes up to me\
  \ and asks if I know where to get coal for his Hubb (Hookah/Shisha pipe). The first\
  \ few thoughts that came to mind was, why is he asking another guest this question?\
  \ And why is he asking me? I gave him a confused giggle and swift \u2018I don\u2019\
  t know, I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 He then apologised for interrupting as he could see\
  \ I was reading, and offered to hang out if I wanted to. I being me I graciously\
  \ declined his invitation, but after he headed to the other side of the pool the\
  \ memory of me promising myself to be more social came back. For the next 15 minutes\
  \ I sat starring at my book trying to work up the courage to speak to the strange\
  \ boy whose name I still don\u2019t remember. Once my lungs started to tighten and\
  \ my palms had just enough sweat on them, I plucked up the courage to use the lines\
  \ I came up with and were still repeating in my head. \nHe was 17, just matriculated\
  \ and was hoping to get into UCT. A magical thing happened after that\u2026 We ended\
  \ up talking about everything, religion, the universe, our friends, and the weather,\
  \ where we grew up and even his favourite colour. It was so amazing to have such\
  \ a genuine and stimulating conversation with a complete stranger who actually understood\
  \ where I was coming from with my anxiety, and giving me a new perspective. When\
  \ we eventually parted ways I felt lighter, like there was a weight lifted off my\
  \ shoulders. \nIn conclusion I\u2019ve decided to have more conversations no matter\
  \ how awkward they start because I\u2019ve started to realise travelling isn\u2019\
  t always about the location, it\u2019s about people their stories too."
