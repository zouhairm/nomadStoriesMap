Text: "travellers, many of us are in constant search of genuine cultural experiences.\
  \ This is especially true \u2013 and especially tricky \u2013 for that particular\
  \ breed of travellers who want to capture such wonderful moments using various digital\
  \ gadgets; after all, sticking a camera into somebody\u2019s face and business isn\u2019\
  t necessarily the best way to remain inconspicuous. Even worse is that nagging suspicion\
  \ that what we are witnessing might be a show put on especially for our benefit.\n\
  \nHaving spent close to a year conducting a research project in Kenya\u2019s Maasai\
  \ Mara, we had yet to attend a proper ceremony or celebration of any kind. After\
  \ three months in Europe, we returned to the Mara for a few days on our way to Uganda\
  \ and the DR Congo. Out of the blue, one of our Maasai friends, Lekishon, called\
  \ me. He was delighted to hear that we were back, because two days later he was\
  \ getting married! Would we like to come? And would I mind taking some photos for\
  \ him at the wedding?\n\nEarly in the morning of the big day, a group of Lekishon\u2019\
  s friends came to see us with shukas (blankets), jewelry and other decorations:\
  \ our party - we had two Californian friends with us - was to look the part."
