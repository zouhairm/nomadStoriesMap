Text: "This story is related to the time I was traveling to my favorite city, which\
  \ is Istanbul, Turkey, and the happening took place in the summer of 2018. I was\
  \ already there for several days enjoying the city, the history, the people and\
  \ the food and was about time to leave and to return to the place I was living in,\
  \ Sofia, Bulgaria. \nSo, the story itself starts one night before going from Istanbul\
  \ back to Sofia, Bulgaria, where we were volunteering at that point. Together with\
  \ my friend and the common Turkish friend were staying at a terrace in the center\
  \ of Istanbul enjoying life. It was a late evening in middle of June, everything\
  \ was surrounded by the scent of the seas, both Black and Marmara being quiet but\
  \ present, the seagulls fooling around, the mosques around us singing the Evening\
  \ pray loud and there we are smoking shisha, the traditional Turkish smoking \u2018\
  tool\u2019 not-so-lungs-friendly, drinking tea and eating baklava, the Turkish delight.\
  \ The only thing missing then was our returning plan back to Sofia. As I was saying\
  \ before, we didn\u2019t have many options and the most viable one was the proposal\
  \ of my friend: hitchhiking. The road between Istanbul and Sofia is around 300 km\
  \ and crossing the border from outside European Union to its firsts borders, the\
  \ Bulgarian one. \nMy friend, Aleksandra, was very passionate about the idea of\
  \ hitchhiking to Sofia, the Turkish friend started to give us suggestions how to\
  \ reach the Istanbul\u2019s highway from the city center, while I was there  double-anxious,\
  \ first, because I didn\u2019t want to leave, second, because I couldn\u2019t see\
  \ myself with two luggage and no direction to be back. However, I accepted the offer.\
  \ \nThe next morning at 10 o\u2019clock we were already in the bus from the center\
  \ to the highway. It took 2 hours with three different busses to arrive from the\
  \ middle of the City to the middle of nowhere and waiting to be picked-up. Was the\
  \ first time for me so I said to Aleksandra that I would like to experience the\
  \ truck traveling. After few seconds a truck stopped and took us for half an hour\
  \ or so (was not the only time when a truck stopped after I was wishing this, but\
  \ let\u2019s keep the other stories for another time). The driver didn\u2019t speak\
  \ English or anything else beside Turkish, like most of them, but language is more\
  \ than words; however, he offered us two hats where is written SULTAN, \u2018to\
  \ protect against the sun\u2019. After, he let us on the road again, another car\
  \ stopped in few moments. \nAfter a short stop to a gas station where the driver\
  \ let a big amount of money in the car and the engine turned on, he returned and\
  \ took us for 30 minutes or so. From there, another one who let us near the border.\
  \ It was a great experience to cross the border by foot, since the driver let us\
  \ 2 kilometers before, it felt like in the ancient times; we continue to change\
  \ cars and trucks on the Bulgarian highway, in full summer day long until evening,\
  \ when we reached Sofia. The way was all about trying to make the cars stop and\
  \ took us somewhere, but more than that, was more related to the passionate and\
  \ intensive journey of pure freedom. Whether was because the drivers were all interested\
  \ in finding out why a Romanian and a Latvian are traveling like... this in Turkey,\
  \ either because they were offering us to drink also alcohol near the so-wanted\
  \ water, since we were leftover it, or just because was the first time I saw freedom\
  \ in my way.  \nRegardless the tiredness of changing the cars and walking a lot\
  \ on the road, the best feeling I got from this day was the one of freedom, something\
  \ that I really didn\u2019t expect to find. In this way, I was able to walk whenever\
  \ I felt the need, to discover the people who were driving us, to find out that\
  \ communication is much more than the language, and, for the cherry on the top,\
  \ that great experiences could be also for free."
