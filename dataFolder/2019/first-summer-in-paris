Text: "In the beginning, the city unfurls one frame, one moment at a time, and in\
  \ the same breath, all at once. Novelty forces existence into the present moment,\
  \ a collection of images that will remain imprinted to the last: the cigarette butts\
  \ that litter the lino floor of the airport arrivals lounge, grimy streaks of yellow\
  \ sun through the train windows, the waking houses bathed in warm hues of apricot.\
  \ Everything crackles with newness; there are no immediate signs of Paris.\n\nI\
  \ was 23 when I left home. A one-way ticket had become a symbol of the future life\
  \ I wanted: unencumbered, unforced, unwritten. I bought the cheapest fare I could,\
  \ passing through Tahiti, the only country outside my own I\u2019d ever visited,\
  \ and the destination of a former high-school exchange that seared itself into my\
  \ history and my then 16-year-old heart; then LA, where the security guards yelled\
  \ like they do in American prison films, cops with bulging stomachs guzzled Pepsi\
  \ from a can on the job, and immigration officers said, 'Mam', as if you were already\
  \ a felon. \n\nIn the 40-hour aerial trek over the globe, there is no more time.\
  \ Just a space between 'before' and 'after'. And even if you were to go home straight\
  \ after the 'after,' there is no getting away from the fact that, once left, you\
  \ can never go back to 'before'. \n\nTo get into the central city, you must wind\
  \ through the suburbs. To pass through them is like looking at the uncrafted underbelly\
  \ of a grand tapestry. There is nothing in the squat maze of streets and buildings\
  \ spread beneath the overground train tracks that indicate overt beauty. The pavements\
  \ are treeless. The neon crosses to indicate the presence of a pharmacy glow unnaturally,\
  \ electric lime beacons in the dawn fog. Cars and people move about as if in their\
  \ own mini-cities as the train passes overhead. Dirty stone buildings with dull\
  \ peach shutters and burnt orange roof tiles sit staidly beside the tracks like\
  \ worn old palm trees, waving the years by and by and by, and with them the many\
  \ thousand click-click-clicks of passing carriages and lives. \n\nThe grandeur of\
  \ the station names - Aulnay-sous-Bois, Le Bourget, La Courneuve - Aubervilliers\
  \ - belie the apartment ghettos that dominate an otherwise flat landscape. Like\
  \ sheer windowed cliffs, they overwhelm and overpower their artless concrete environs.\
  \ Once you reach Gare du Nord, the smell of smoke, the sight of gum-encrusted platforms,\
  \ and the men that wander unfocused and jumpy with their sacks of faux Paris-themed\
  \ souvenirs, reveals an unease not quickly forgotten. Yet soon the grime, the salty-sour\
  \ smell of the metro, the clash of existences, will become as familiar and acceptable\
  \ as the capital\u2019s Haussmannian uniformity. Its narrow passages and creamy\
  \ light that slants between buildings will move you for a lifetime. \n\nBut for\
  \ now the empty, white concrete corridors inspire only terror as you exit at Saint-Michel,\
  \ winding your way out, alone. A single round mirror pinned to the wall magnifies\
  \ the hugeness of the passage, and your own figure passes through its reflective\
  \ eye, tiny and distorted, a solitary ghost. Eventually, the temperature of the\
  \ light becomes less blue and more golden. Air rushes into the tunnel. The trail\
  \ of escalator finally reveals a strip of blue sky. At 7am, the streets are still\
  \ empty and quiet. The barrelling brushes of the street cleaning vans hum as they\
  \ scour the sides of the curbs. There\u2019s a siren in the distance. \n\nThen you\
  \ turn and there is Notre Dame. The leaves of the street trees dance in a summer\
  \ wind, framing the splendour of the cathedral's two Gothic columns and intricately-studded\
  \ circular glass window. Unexpected, the scene catches in your throat, like you\u2019\
  ve always known it and never known it, and now suddenly, the world is open."
