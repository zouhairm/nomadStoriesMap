Text: "My clothes are nearly finishing their final spin when he appears beside me,\
  \ carrying an overstuffed plastic bag. I shift my feet to let him pass more comfortably,\
  \ and his presence fills the small space. Yet it\u2019s not his rugged build that\
  \ makes me take notice. That\u2019s not unusual. It\u2019s the wavy shoulder-length\
  \ hair that stands out on a man his age.\n\nWe greet each other in Spanish, and\
  \ he gets right to task, pouring the clothes into the only other washer. Out tumble\
  \ dress shirts in many patterns, wrinkled and crinkled from days crammed into the\
  \ tiny shopping bag. I\u2019m taken by his no-nonsense style of doing laundry: In\
  \ go the clothes and then the liquid soap directly on top. He closes the lid, inserts\
  \ the token, and the machine kicks into gear. \n\nAll the while, we\u2019re chatting\
  \ pleasantries. The minute I speak, he knows I\u2019m not a native, so he asks if\
  \ I\u2019m living here or passing through. I like the thought of just passing through,\
  \ because that\u2019s how I feel about my life right now. I want to say, \u201C\
  Yep, just another stop on the route.\u201D Though I tell him I\u2019m an English\
  \ teacher, been here since May. It\u2019s a short exchange of jobs and cities as\
  \ my washer drains and his fills. All in Spanish. It\u2019s a wonder I can even\
  \ have this sort of conversation with a Chilean and actually communicate. I bid\
  \ him farewell and wander off with my sack of wet clothes that I\u2019ll dry on\
  \ the plastic rack in my studio apartment.\n\nIn my two months living here, I can\u2019\
  t say I\u2019ve ever heard the phone on my wall ring, so I\u2019m startled when\
  \ it does. The doorman asks if he has the right apartment number. More of his words\
  \ fill my ear faster than I can understand. I ask him to repeat himself\u2014but\
  \ this time m\xE1s lento. Is he wondering if I\u2019m done using the washer? He\
  \ continues to talk. And then silence right before we both hang up.\n\nA foreign\
  \ language is always more difficult on the phone. In my classes, students practice\
  \ having phone calls in English. They struggle. One time I told them to have the\
  \ conversation in Spanish first. They gave me crazy looks like it was against the\
  \ law to speak Spanish in English class. And it sort of is, but I needed to see\
  \ their natural, talk-on-the-phone personality. They giggled and looked guilty.\
  \ But then did it. After, they repeated the conversation in English. They spoke\
  \ slower and more measured and with less confidence, but they offered a few more\
  \ natural facial expressions than before the exercise.\n\nMy clothes are newly hung\
  \ on the drying rack when I hear another infrequent sound: the doorbell. I peer\
  \ out the peephole and see the profile of the man from the laundry room.\n\n\u201C\
  Hola,\u201D I say.\n\nThe familiar voice begins to talk, and then it dawns on me\
  \ that the doorman just gave out my apartment number. I freeze and want to unwind\
  \ time, feeling exposed and vulnerable. Yet not annoyed. After all, this is Chile.\
  \ Age, personal details, nothing\u2019s off limits. Students tell me job interviews\
  \ are full of invasive questions. Why would divulging an apartment number to another\
  \ tenant be a big deal?\n\nHis empty hands hang by his side. The hallway in late\
  \ afternoon is quiet. I feel awkward talking through the door to a guy I had such\
  \ a carefree conversation with mere minutes ago, so I undo the latch and slowly\
  \ pull the knob toward me. My suitcase from when I returned earlier today from southern\
  \ Chile is visible. As am I. \n\nI recognize a few of his words\u2014and smile.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s hard to find private students in Santiago. They all say they want\
  \ classes, often gushing with enthusiasm, but when you follow up, they flake out,\
  \ and you never hear from them again.\n\nAnd now one is standing at my very own\
  \ door. \n\n\u201COf course, I\u2019ll teach you English.\u201D\n\nI grab a pen\
  \ and a note card to write down his email. I finally introduce myself."
