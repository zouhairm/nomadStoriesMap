Text: "Enjoying the sunshine beating down across my chilled, pink cheeks, I watched\
  \ as countless families and couples shared their love with one another. \n\nThe\
  \ steps to the Alfonso Xll monument in Retiro park had become much more crowded\
  \ as the afternoon sun began to set. \n\nMaking room for others, I finished my lunch\
  \ and migrated closer to the breathtaking statue. \n\nMoments after becoming comfortable,\
  \ an older gentleman came strolling through the courtyard. His boisterous appearance\
  \ was captivating. Instantly our energies were drawn to each other. \n\nClaiming\
  \ a seat next to me, my new  acquaintance and I began sharing the various snacks\
  \ we each had packed for our days adventure.  \n\nOur conversation continued for\
  \ the next two hours. We spoke of our lives, my dreams, our childhoods, his children,\
  \ my home time, his life in Madrid.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t your typical conversation\
  \ though. You see. Francisco did not speak any English, and I spoke not a word of\
  \ Spanish. Our discussion consisted of stick drawings in the sand, charade performance,\
  \ and hand miming. \n\nTogether, arm in arm, we watched the sun set. \n\nAfter a\
  \ hug and kiss goodbye, we parted ways. \n\nTo this day, that conversation without\
  \ words created the most spectacular connections I never expect to find. \n\nThank\
  \ you  Francisco for positively changing my life."
