Text: "I was recently invited to join the last leg of a Caribbean excursion with a\
  \ group of seasoned sailors.  After two flights and a ride from some locals, I found\
  \ my mates on a private beach on the island of Canouan.  From there we swam, drunk\
  \ rum punch, ate fresh seafood and basked in the sunshine day.  Later that night,\
  \ we slept under the stars, dozing off being rocked to sleep by the motion of the\
  \ swells. \n\nAfter a few days, my partner and I went off on our own.  We made arrangements\
  \ to stay on the island of Bequia.  I didn't expect to find myself in love with\
  \ a land I had never heard of, with people I had never known and a culture one can\
  \ only hope to find.\n\nBequia, is a small island.  An unspoiled land, where the\
  \ people are authentically themselves.  They have managed to systematically work\
  \ together, to benefit from the tourism collectively - while at the same time ensuring\
  \ every visitor feels safe, welcome and relaxed.  \n\nI didn't expect to find such\
  \ effortless luxury.  The kindest eyes.  The freshest seafood.  The clearest, warmest\
  \ sea water.  I didn't expect to sleep in a bed so comfortable, sleep with the windows\
  \ wide open, listening to the sound of the shore crashing into the sand, birds chirping\
  \ cheerfully, wishing me a good morning and sweet dreams at night.\n\nI didn't expect\
  \ a warm smile and wave from every single passerby.   Flowers so vibrant, fruit\
  \ so fresh, sand so white.  \n\nI didn't expect to disconnect from my life back\
  \ home with such ease.  Forgetting my phones whereabouts, capturing pictures only\
  \ in my memory, solemnly swearing to my partner to never tell another soul about\
  \ Bequia, because it is just too good of a place to share.\n\nI didn't expect to\
  \ return home and maintain a strong level of relaxation - a true sign of an actual\
  \ holiday, real rest and break from it all."
