Text: "The pathway beneath my feet was no longer a paved sidewalk, it had transformed\
  \ into a path of rust coloured dirt and litter. Moving my gaze upwards, thousands\
  \ of colourful shack-like formations cluttered the massive hillside we started to\
  \ parade up.\nStumbling along the post-apocalyptic-like streets, our guide Gabriel\
  \ snapped me out of a daze by saying \u201CWelcome to the ghetto\u201D. The streets\
  \ seemed lifeless besides a couple stray dogs that seemed uneasy about our presence\
  \ there. They traipsed ahead of us, unfazed by stepping through the piles of garbage\
  \ or scattered feces that littered the streets. Though we were seemingly alone,\
  \ it felt as if we were being watched.\nTruthfully, I was feeling a bit uneasy.\
  \ Even though I was in a group and with a guide who had been granted the right to\
  \ be there, it felt as though we were intruding on a vulnerable community. Gabriel\
  \ herded our hesitant group towards a pale yellow painted building.\nHe led us up\
  \ creaking, wooden steps into a home, made of scrap metal, tarps and rubble. Dogs\
  \ were barking and a child was crying as we entered. We trekked through the small;\
  \ cement floored living space as the residents kept a close, untrusting eye; tracking\
  \ our every move. Their existence was dependant on the treasures hidden within their\
  \ home, deep in the ghetto of Lima.\nThe home was misleading; it was actually a\
  \ labyrinth of interconnected buildings. Moving from room to room, and up more stairs,\
  \ a soft clicking noise grew stronger, until finally we were looking at 50 homemade\
  \ wooden cages stacked along a wall. We stood in a single file line, face to face\
  \ with trained killers. Fighting cocks met our gaze.\nA well-built Peruvian man\
  \ approached the group with a smile and greeted us in Spanish, followed with a translation\
  \ by our guide. His demeanour was welcoming, the first we met in this shantytown.\
  \ He proceeded to warn us not to try to touch the birds, though none had their spikes\
  \ (cockspurs) attached, they were bred to be naturally vicious and most were quite\
  \ unpredictable. Needless to say when the man reached down, unlatched a lock and\
  \ swung open one of the cages, we all jumped a few steps back. He picked up the\
  \ humungous rooster and held it on its back in his arms the way a mother would hold\
  \ a baby. A feeling of fear was present in the room. \nOur host educated us about\
  \ the legal sport of cockfighting. With 6% of the countries population involved\
  \ in the business, it\u2019s claimed to be more popular than soccer. Though he owned,\
  \ bred and trained roughly 500 birds at that time, he took special pride in his\
  \ three \u201CChampions\u201D or \u201CStuds\u201D that were worth between $3000USD\
  \ and $6000USD each. To be a Champion, these birds not only have to win multiple\
  \ fights, but have killed their opponents in the arena. The bird in his arms, had\
  \ won three. This brutal and unforgiving sport has been passed down through his\
  \ family for generation, with quite a history of winning birds, he was honoured\
  \ to continue the tradition and make his predecessors proud. \nPetting and occasionally\
  \ kissing the cooing rooster being held, he warned that the fights are not for the\
  \ faint of heart. These birds are apart of his family and are their only source\
  \ of income, so if a life is lost, his family mourns. Up to 3000sols can be won\
  \ at these cockfights. If your rooster kills, it could be much more. The man showed\
  \ us the bird\u2019s fierce talons and mimed how he would put the cockspurs onto\
  \ the horns of its feet, not daring to actually place them on, knowing the aggression\
  \ that would come after. \nThis man and his family live among some of the poorest\
  \ in the county. Yet had a gold mine in the back of their house. He seemed happy\
  \ and once the other family members warmed up to us, I could tell that they were\
  \ happy too. They were doing what they loved and were surviving solely on their\
  \ family\u2019s earnings, human or not."
