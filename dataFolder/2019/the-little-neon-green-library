Text: "The first time I passed by the little neon green room, I thought it was a high-tech\
  \ concept store. Tucked into Taipei metro\u2019s underground tunnels, and flanked\
  \ by colorful cosmetic stores, it was no bigger than 100 meters squared. The windows\
  \ and closed doors were all glass; there was nobody inside the fluorescently lit\
  \ space. Outside, there stood an electric kiosk and a card scanner, along with a\
  \ sign labeled \u201CTaipei Municipal Public Library.\u201D \n\nI\u2019d never seen\
  \ this place before. It must have been built during the 12 years since I moved away\
  \ from Taipei. \n\nWherever I go in the world, I look for a library. Even if I\u2019\
  m only visiting the city for a few hours, I\u2019m drawn to the public spaces where\
  \ I could see what books and cultural knowledge were most dear to the community.\
  \ I remember reading free verse in the cavernous Jefferson Market Library in New\
  \ York, and flipping through design books in an architecture library in Hong Kong,\
  \ the cool pages brushing against my fingers on a scorching summer day. I love the\
  \ order of libraries, that universal desire to organize the unknown. The day I found\
  \ the neon green library in Taipei, I was trying to find home in a hometown that\u2019\
  s no longer familiar. \n\nI broke away from the crowd of people speed walking hurriedly\
  \ to get to their next metro station, and peered inside. It was sparsely furnished,\
  \ save for a row of shelves along the back wall and a handful of couches. Hesitantly,\
  \ unsure if I was even allowed, I pulled out my metro card and matched its colorful\
  \ square logo to the square logo on the card reader. It beeped satisfactorily, the\
  \ glass doors slid open, and I was in.\n\nIt really was a fully functioning library,\
  \ except without any librarians. There were checkout kiosks plus an abbreviated,\
  \ but impressively diverse, collection of books: fiction, nonfiction, children,\
  \ and even foreign languages. I took my time carefully perusing the shelves, climbing\
  \ the step stool and squatting down to read every title. The last time I was in\
  \ a Taiwanese library, I was still in first grade, spreading out the children\u2019\
  s newspaper on large tables with my mom and twin sister. Could a tiny, electronic\
  \ library still give me that same sense of security?\n\nYes. As I made my way from\
  \ Tang dynasty poetry to history, the door repeatedly hissed open to let other visitors\
  \ in. Sometimes I leaned back to let a child reach over for a picture book, or turned\
  \ to watch an elderly man ponder the wuxia (Chinese martial arts) novels with more\
  \ intrigue than I had thought them worthy of. Fittingly for a library situated in\
  \ a major transit station, the people here never stayed very long. They came, strolled\
  \ purposefully to their usual section, and checked out what they needed. Yet it\
  \ never felt impersonal. Perhaps because I\u2019d always felt comfortable surrounded\
  \ by books, and seeing a diverse community of readers pass through reminded me that\
  \ even if I struggle to express my thoughts in Chinese, we share a love for language\
  \ itself.\n\nLater during my study abroad semester in Taiwan, I\u2019d find bigger\
  \ and more traditional libraries like the ones I went to with my family. Still,\
  \ I always came back to this one. I never did figure out how the seasoned regulars\
  \ knew just where to go, because the books were so few that a small change in availability\
  \ dramatically shifted the locations of\u2013or perhaps changed the existence of\u2013\
  entire topics. I showed up each time knowing that I\u2019d have to relearn where\
  \ the food writing and essay collections were, but I made room in my schedule. Maybe\
  \ today I\u2019d find the childhood literary heroes I grew up with, or discover\
  \ that there are Taiwanese authors discussing Slow Food principles for village cuisine.\
  \ Either way, it\u2019s well worth my hours."
