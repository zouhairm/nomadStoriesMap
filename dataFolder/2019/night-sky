Text: 'It started as a normal day, when we, me and my friends, decided to go to "pondicherry"
  - more than 500kilometers from the place we were studying to get our undergraduate
  degrees.

  Even before the sun could rise on December 18th we were on our bikes headed toward
  pondicherry. It took us almost 12 hours to reach pondicherry. On the way, we stopped
  for local tea and met amazing villagers and heard quite fascinating stories about
  their village. We were tired, wanted to sleep and exhausted when we finally reached
  pondicherry. Just when i thought i was exhausted and want to go to my hotel room,
  there it was- a spectacular view of the rocky beach and water. Just blue, clear
  water for miles and miles, and i was mesmerized by the beauty.

  Pondicherry, the place colonized by the French is just a travelers paradise, warm
  smiles of people, spectacular views, beaches, quite street and amazing foods and
  also, the beer is rather cheap there.

  Pondicherry has rocky beach, sand beach and you could just walk on the beach and
  feel the fresh air running across your hairs, skin.

  I stayed in Pondicherry for 3 days and returned. 12 hours of bike ride to get back
  to university. Quite an adventure.'
