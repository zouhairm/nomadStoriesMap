Text: "\u201CThe place in which somebody doesn\u2019t stop to think about you. That\
  \ is your house\u201D \u2026 This is one of my favorite quotes from a famous Manga.\
  \ \nAfter my Erasmus in Lisbon, from September until January, the quote in my mind\
  \ and in my heart is changed. And now that quote, well that feeling, is \u201CHome\
  \ is the place that you never stop to think about\u201D.\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter\
  \ of be crazy or be in love\u2026 or maybe it\u2019s a matter of both. It\u2019\
  s a matter of be in love with the place that gives you sun and energy all day long.\
  \ It\u2019s a matter of be crazy deciding which sunset go to see if from LX factory\
  \ or from Monsanto. \n\nTo be in love with the fairy castle of Sintra or with magic\
  \ natural places as Boca do Inferno. To be crazy eating in sequence sweet things\
  \ and salty and then again salty as pastel, bacalhau and pastel. \n\nWell, I really\
  \ don\u2019t know if I am crazy for this place, or I am in love. What I know for\
  \ sure is that Lisbon is the place that showed me how the city in which I will leave\
  \ would be, how the places would be and mostly, how the people would be. How would\
  \ like that people surrounding me should behave, how much people could be kind and\
  \ polite, and gentle at the same moment. \n\nAll the positive vibrations in my heart,\
  \ taken from the experience of this city, are the everyday topic with my family,\
  \ friends and strangers. And if they try to stop my enthusiasm I just go on with\
  \ my story, like a train, like nobody could even stop me. A train that takes on\
  \ itself all the good and the gold that I've met in this occidental part of the\
  \ Europe. A train that wants to share the gold and the good. A train that would\
  \ like to take as many passengers as possible, to give them the opportunity to leave\
  \ the same kind of vibrations. \n\nThere was this girl, travelling alone... feeling\
  \ herself alone... And each time she looks around her she didn't understand where\
  \ she was and what the people where saying. Suddenly, those places became familiar,\
  \ those people became friendly, those languages became understandable. \nAnd in\
  \ the ocean of people, that were understanding each other, the girl was swimming,\
  \ navigating and surfing; feeling free to be herself."
