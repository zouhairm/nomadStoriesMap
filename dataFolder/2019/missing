Text: "A mask lay discarded on the pavement. Lonely, like a singular abandoned glove,\
  \ a fallen petal, an odd sock in the washing machine. It was white and surgical\
  \ and its pattern of tiny holes soon became visible, filling with grey rain as a\
  \ hurried boot landed it soaking into the gutter.\n\nThe mask was one of many. Above,\
  \ a scattering of white confetti littered the street view ahead. Faces were anonymised\
  \ as row upon row of proceeding eyes scanned for the fastest possible route through\
  \ the network of bodies. I tried to read into the eyes, wondering who was tired,\
  \ excited, in love; but in that moment I could see only Argus Panoptes, a many-eyed\
  \ robot fixated on its destination. \n\n *** Route calculated. Begin journey. ***\n\
  \nThe surgical masks weren\u2019t frightening, only displacing. It was like walking\
  \ through a museum, or watching someone else playing a video game. In between two\
  \ torn buildings, like a frame, cranes and telephone wires drew a grid in perfect\
  \ geometric simplicity on top of the grey sky. Out of the corner of my eye, neon\
  \ lights pointing to karaoke and arcades and photo booths glared: Akihabara was\
  \ built for play. The bodies and disguises were programmed into the game, generating\
  \ gentle pulsing vibrations. I wasn\u2019t a part of the rhythm. \n\nA sign at the\
  \ station read in English: \u201CPlease show manners. If you are ill, wear your\
  \ mask in public\u201D. I stifled my cough. \n\nThere is something very particular\
  \ about how the Japanese carry themselves en masse: they fit like part of a puzzle,\
  \ the machine making up the street and the city. Each body moves effortlessly in\
  \ relation to the others - routinely, magnetically - yet each cog is uniquely individual.\
  \ One youngster wore a heavy blue fringe and boxed, baggy clothing, clean cut and\
  \ more chic than any Parisian. An old woman was bent over, eyes quivering and wrinkles\
  \ overlapping on her frail skin, yet her hunch was elegant and convincing. She carried\
  \ herself with the strength of a giant. \n \nI became aware of my body. My fringe\
  \ stuck to my forehead from the raindrops and my nails were rugged and irritating.\
  \ My rucksack doubled in weight. I wanted to go home and scrub. I coughed. I was\
  \ filthy and I was infected, a virus in the programme. Alienated and interrupting,\
  \ I felt as though all 37,435,191 people in Tokyo were disapproving and staring.\
  \ Of course they weren\u2019t. They each had their own worries and their own homes\
  \ to return to. They didn\u2019t take a second glance.  \n\nI picked up the mask.\
  \ The concrete returned to its satisfying rectangular pattern, freed from distractions.\
  \ I wondered who it could have belonged to, and looked for a rubbish bin. \n\n***\
  \ Destination missing. Recalculating route\u2026***"
