Text: "Whats the first thing come to your mind when i say Thailand? \nWell for most\
  \ people the party islands like Krabi or Kho Pha-ngan.\nSandy beaches and amazing\
  \ clear blue water.\nOr what other people say, i hear from Thailand, there is a\
  \ red light district in Bankok. \nFor me was different. My first long trip to some\
  \ strange asain country and my mind blown away. \nI remember first shock was the\
  \ heat. I came from a cold, rainy country, and when i walk out from Bankok airport\
  \ I couldn't breath for a sec was just way to warm and humid.\nPeople are seem nice\
  \ in general, friendly, smiling, but they dont talk to much in english so prepare\
  \ yourself, learn some thai words for example:\n\nSa-wat dee (hello)\nUsed for both\
  \ hello and goodbye.  \n\nKhop koon (thank you) \nBe polite, use it, locals will\
  \ like you more. \n\nGee baht? (how much) \nRemember one thing, before you sit in\
  \ a tuk-tuk (local transport, kinda small 3 wheel machine with a box where you can\
  \ sit it) \nask gee bath, cause they over charge you.\n\nYoo tee nai...? (where\
  \ is...) \nGood to know if you get lost or you cant find one of the amazing temples.\n\
  \nSo i spend my first few days in Bangkok, to visit the kings palace and the old\
  \ part of the city. At that time, the Thai King, Bhumibol the Great died, and it\
  \ was ceremonies all across Bangkok. People in black clothes marched on the streets,\
  \ wearing badges with the king's face on it, or flags.\n\nThe Grand Palace is at\
  \ the heart of Bangkok, residence of the Kings of Siam since 1782. \n\nI tought\
  \ all thai people are buddhist, its actually true and not. In Thailand there is\
  \ religious freedom. \nWhat is cool to be honest, so if i want i could believe in\
  \ Buddha and in Jesus at the same time, nobody would put any blame on me. \n\nLike\
  \ thai people, they dont seem stressed, even there are people live on the streets,\
  \ they still smiling, and selling the freshly picked mangos and coconuts.\n\nOne\
  \ thing, keep in mind, don't even try to drink the water from the tap, always bottled\
  \ water, if you dont want to get sick. \nWell i was way too brave, on my third night\
  \ stopped at a street food market. \nWasn't the smartest decision in my life. Lets\
  \ say I needed to stay longer in Bangkok as i wanted to. \n\nMy favourite place\
  \ i seen in Thailand is Sukhothai. This place is mindblowing. \n13th- and 14th-century\
  \ palaces and temples of the Kingdom of Siam\u2019s first capital.\nWhen i arrive\
  \ there, with tuk-tuk from the train station, i felt happiness and joy, i never\
  \ felt before in my life. \n\nTo see real local life, i suggest, go up north to\
  \ Chang Mai are.\nHike and get lost in the jungle, to find a small village, where\
  \ people grew coffee beans.\n\nTry once the night train from Bangkok to Chang Mai,\
  \ good experience to meet some unique people, who ready for adventures, to see the\
  \ world.\n\nThats my dream too, to see the impossible and find the joy and hapinness\
  \ in the adventure we call life."
