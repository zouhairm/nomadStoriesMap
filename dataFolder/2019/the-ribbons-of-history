Text: "As palm fronds rustle gently behind me, I raise my hand, square my crimson-clad\
  \ shoulders, and knock purposefully on the scarred wooden door.  \n\nOnly my shaking\
  \ breathing gives me away. \n\nSilence. Footsteps on the other side. The pit patter\
  \ of many feet and the rattling clang of a lock moving. Two more quick and quivering\
  \ breaths on my side as my fingers with a mind of their own nervously fold and refold\
  \ the worn piece of paper with the Hebrew address painstakingly traced.  \n\nThe\
  \ door is suddenly thrown open and three faces peer at me, the warmth in their almond-colored\
  \ eyes quickly replaced by shock and a rounding of their lips. My eyes dart left\
  \ and right searching for the family resemblance, the light bump of the nose or\
  \ the hint of a crooked smile, anything to confirm that I am in the right place.\
  \ \n\nAnd then I see her. I take in her face, now lightly marked by years of laughter\
  \ and a life fully lived, and I recognize the beautiful woman from the yellowed\
  \ photograph. \n\nThree months prior and an ocean away, I had called my mom to let\
  \ her know I was traveling to the Middle East. Upon hearing me say Israel, she went\
  \ uncharacteristically silent. \n\n\u201CAsia, mamy tam rodzine.\u201D  Asia, we\
  \ have family there. \n\n\nAs the daughter of immigrants, I had grown up assuming\
  \ that all the rest of my relatives were in Poland. It was lonely being in a country\
  \ where you could never be enveloped in the arms of your grandfather, never experience\
  \ the rucus of a family reunion, never know your cousins. Now, I learn that there\
  \ is even more family that I do not know about, and the gaping hole grows bigger.\
  \ \n\nMom, who are they? \n\nShe tells me to watch my mail and to call her when\
  \ the letter comes. The day I receive the email from my campus postmaster, I hurriedly\
  \ run out of class in the middle of lecture, excitedly anticipating the contents\
  \ of the letter waiting in my mail cubby. \n\n\nI carefully rip open the envelope,\
  \ only to discover an old envelope with two black and white photographs inside.\
  \ In each, two different young couples, the men, handsome in their wedding garb,\
  \ the women wrapped in white veils tucked into their sides. \n\nI pull out my phone,\
  \ \u201CMom, who are they?\u201D \n\nAsiu, these are my cousins, and these photos\
  \ are the only link I have to them. Then, our family history comes tumbling out.\
  \ I learn that my grandmother\u2019s sisters had survived Aushwitz-Birkenau, and\
  \ that one of them had fallen in love with a fellow survivor and moved to Israel.\
  \ I find out that my great-aunt had two children, and had mailed photos of their\
  \ wedding days from Israel to my grandmother in Poland, who had in turn mailed them\
  \ to her daughter in Chicago 25 years ago. \n\nAsiu, find them. Find my cousins.\
  \ \n\nThat night, I copy the photographs and carefully write a letter on the back\
  \ in both Polish and in English. Hello, you do not know me, but I am your family..\
  \ Do you still live at this old address? I will be in Israel soon. Please call me.\
  \ \n\nFour weeks before my trip, a call from an unknown number. \n\nHello, I am\
  \ your Aunt Lea from Israel. \n\nThe sounds of tinkling laughter jar me back to\
  \ reality. With disbelief and a chuckle in his voice, my new-found cousin shares\
  \ that his mother has been dreaming of a woman in red for the last year.\n\n\nAnd\
  \ as the hands of my ancestors nudge me forward, I cross the threshold into my aunt\u2019\
  s arms, my red hair ribbon fluttering in the wind."
