Text: "The first time I traveled alone was to Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.\
  \ Even though I saw pictures of the city before, I wasn't ready for what I find,\
  \ and by that, I mean myself. With 419 years old, Natal is a place that catches\
  \ your eye by the minute that you put your feet there. Beaches with white sand,\
  \ a blue ocean that maches with the sky - almost free from clouds, a hot weather\
  \ that invites you to enjoy the best that summer can offer and... Amazing people.\
  \ The thing that makes me remember everyday of this trip was the amazing conection\
  \ I made with the local residents; they were kind, fun and so easygoing that I feel\
  \ like I was on my own home, that I belonged. See, the northeast of Brazil is a\
  \ region considered beautiful in so many states, so many cities, but if you decide\
  \ to go there once, you'll never forget about the people. One of them really marked\
  \ my memory, his name was Jo\xE3o and his was a Buggy driver - an open tipe of car\
  \ -, he had a nickname that I can't remember, but he was the one that made the day\
  \ unforgettable. Jo\xE3o took us in his Buggy through white dunes of sand, always\
  \ asking \"with or without emotion?\", making a simple ride look like a rollercoaster.\
  \ Up and down we traveled in places that look like a dessert, but they were very\
  \ close to the sea. Jo\xE3o showed us views that will always be like photographs\
  \ on my mind, beaches that looked endless, dromedaries that we could ride on, places\
  \ that we could feel free, run next to the sea and really have a great time. During\
  \ the trip, Jo\xE3o was looking for out safety, taking pictures for us, telling\
  \ about his life and listening about ours. We heard about his kids, I remember telling\
  \ him that it was the first time that I was traveling with my own money (not really\
  \ far, but still an experience), and the look on his face when he told me that he\
  \ hoped one day, his son and daughter could do the same as me. That day, I realized\
  \ that I loved the decision I made to study journalism, because more than tell people\
  \ back home about the wonderfull place I was, I wanted to tell Jo\xE3o storie; talking\
  \ about what he told me when I came back remembered me what I was: a storyteller\
  \ of other people real stories. This is the reason why I kept this moment on my\
  \ memories forever, because it was more than just I trip, I was a chance of connection\
  \ and sharing. If you ever go to Natal, try to give a chance to meet diferent types\
  \ of individuals, they can improve the experiente. Go to the beaches with a Buggy,\
  \ is more than a vehicle, is a tradition. By night you can find any kind of entertainment,\
  \ clubs with diferent kinds of music, but the best way to get in to the culture\
  \ is getting to know the \"Forr\xF3\" in places like the Rastap\xE9, you will see\
  \ people dancing this old music genre from Brazil and it's really fun to watch and\
  \ participate. Hope you can find great northeasterns on your way."
