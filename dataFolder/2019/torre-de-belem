Text: "Torre de Bel\xE9m\nIt was the 1990s in Caracas, Venezuela. I was about 6 or\
  \ 7 years old when I first saw the Torre de Bel\xE9m, it was in the house of my\
  \ neighbors, the Portuguese. They kept in a wall an old and yellowish photo in which\
  \ the Torre de Bel\xE9m was drawn, in my head began in that moment the desire to\
  \ discover all the wonders of that land that they so gladly described.\nLife went\
  \ on, many things happened, but the memory was always there. \n21 years later I\
  \ found myself with my little daughter and a couple of suitcases at Frankfurt airport,\
  \ waiting for our flight to Lisbon. We arrived at night, so the first image (from\
  \ the plane) I had of Lisbon was that of the millions of little lights of the city.\n\
  The next day our Lisbon adventure began. Traveling with a little girl and not having\
  \ much time, I decided to buy a tourist card that allowed me to move freely throughout\
  \ the city using public transport and I avoided queues to enter most places of interest.\
  \ The best option for transport in Lisbon is the metro, not only because it is a\
  \ fast, economical means of transport that allows you to move around the city, but\
  \ also because of the peculiar and colorful artistic style of its stations. \nThe\
  \ people in Lisbon (and all over Portugal) are quite nice and friendly, however,\
  \ not everyone speaks English, so I recommend learning the basics and bring some\
  \ dictionary to break the language barrier, in my case, I speak decent Portuguese\
  \ and that allowed me to get in touch with locals, listen to their recommendations,\
  \ ask for directions and even make good friends. \nNoa (my daughter) and I walked\
  \ all over the city, we sighed in Terreiro do Pa\xE7o, walked the streets of Alfama,\
  \ vibrated with music in Museu do Fado, hallucinated with the colors of the Museu\
  \ Nacional do Azulejo, swam on the beautiful beach of Cascais, we visited the Ocean\xE1\
  rio de Lisboa, and the Telef\xE9rico in Parque das Na\xE7\xF5es (from where you\
  \ have an excellent view of the Vasco da Gama bridge), we ate the famous past\xEA\
  is de nata (and those of Bacalhau, and the risois, croquetas, and much more)...\
  \ One night I could even cry on an emotional Noite do Fado while drinking a glass\
  \ of Moscatel and then I went to dance in Barrio Alto.\nTime was running out, so\
  \ much to do and so little time... I had to visit Pessoa (one of my favorite writers)\
  \ in Mosteiro dos Jer\xF3nimos, to me it seemed a spectacular place, but after a\
  \ while my daughter got tired. so we went out and started walking, suddenly in front\
  \ of us was the Torre de Bel\xE9m, it looked the same as in the photo, unfortunately\
  \ we could not enter by the large number of people who also wanted to visit it,\
  \ and that didn't matter, I didn't really expect to find so many amazing things\
  \ and have such a good experience like we did, the whole trip was worth every minute.\
  \ \nI have already been to Lisbon a couple of times, I still haven't visited the\
  \ Torre de Bel\xE9m, I have always found a way to get lost in this magical city,\
  \ but Torre de Bel\xE9m is still \"my motive\" to always return to Lisbon."
