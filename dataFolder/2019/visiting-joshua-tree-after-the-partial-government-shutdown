Text: "I had been planning to take a road-trip to Joshua Tree National Park for the\
  \ New Year with my partner, but we were not prepared for President Trump\u2019s\
  \ Partial Government Shutdown. Twelve days into the Partial Government Shutdown\
  \ we were faced with the choice to traverse out to the desert or remain in LA for\
  \ the rest of our holiday. There were online articles covering the conditions of\
  \ Joshua Tree after the shutdown that included an overflow human excrement, paraphernalia\
  \ from unregulated parties, and other unmentionables leftover from the nights of\
  \ governmental abandonment. We decided to check the Joshua Tree National Park geotag\
  \ on social media, which consisted of videos posted by people who were still visiting\
  \ the Park. After weighing our options we decided to carry through with our plans\
  \ and decided to book a same-day rental with Airbnb to stay in for the night. \n\
  \n We left in the afternoon and drove for roughly five hours until getting to the\
  \ tiki-hut style residence in Pioneertown, which was just outside of Joshua Tree.\
  \ That evening we went to a local restaurant called Pappy & Harriet\u2019s, par\
  \ recommendation of our Airbnb host. We were also told to make a reservation, but\
  \ could never have imagined how busy the small-town eatery would have been on a\
  \ Thursday night. Pappy & Harriet\u2019s is an infamous spot in the area and our\
  \ wait time estimate was a total of three hours. The notoriety the restaurant has\
  \ acquired over the years is understandable once you\u2019ve been there, for the\
  \ employees were friendly accommodating, the refreshments were delicious, and the\
  \ menu even accommodated my vegetarian diet. \n\nAfter dinner my boyfriend and I\
  \ curled up next to the space heater situated by the foot of the bed to brace the\
  \ chilly conditions of the evening. The water pipes froze at dawn and they didn\u2019\
  t thaw before we headed out toward the National Park. As a young woman from Los\
  \ Angeles I always just assume the weather is going to be nice and warm wherever\
  \ I go. Let\u2019s just say my Instagram ready outfits were not suitable for the\
  \ event. Checking the weather of the location you\u2019re going to before heading\
  \ out became an apparent necessity for me, even if where you\u2019re going is only\
  \ a few hours away.  \n\nWhen we arrived at the entrance of park we found a note\
  \ posted on kiosk that simply stated the park was closed. There were vehicles parked\
  \ next to the entrance and some beginning to head down the road into the park. After\
  \ careful consideration we decided to drive in and immerse ourselves in the desert\
  \ oasis that is Joshua Tree National Park. The beauty of the natural reserve came\
  \ into full fruition after a few miles into the drive, when boulders started fill\
  \ the open space decorated with Joshua Trees. We pulled off into the parking area\
  \ for a popular bouldering area called Lizard\u2019s Hangout and discovered we weren\u2019\
  t the only ones whose plans weren\u2019t deterred by the shutdown. Tourists and\
  \ adventurists had stopped to gather, take in the beauty, and rock climb in the\
  \ area. There were people who had generously volunteered their time to keep the\
  \ bathrooms stocked with supplies, but the nine campgrounds in the Park were indeed\
  \ closed at the time. \n\nThe entire Park was serene and at peace during our stay\
  \ there, despite the lack of governmental support at the time. It is no surprise\
  \ why people love Joshua Tree so much and volunteered their time to maintain the\
  \ spaces of the National Park that are not solely dedicated to its large wilderness\
  \ layout. According to the national park service, Joshua Tree weighs in at a total\
  \ of 792,623 acres and is home to 19 cultural landscapes; 85% of which are dedicated\
  \ to wilderness. The park has since then been reopened and those who are ready to\
  \ adventure out there for themselves can feel free to reserve one of their campsites.\
  \ I highly recommend going on one of their many hiking trails to get a chance to\
  \ see the plethora of plant, reptile, and mammal species that resides within the\
  \ protected grounds. \n\n\nFor more information check discover Joshua Tree at: https://www.nps.gov/jotr/learn/historyculture/index.htm"
