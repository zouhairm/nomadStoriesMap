Text: "Bernado is a pirate, a lesbian and a 50 year old man with an uneven grey bob.\
  \ He bends for treasure. He sparkles in sunlight. He says I\u2019m a pirate too\
  \ and we\u2019ll sail past conformity but not aluminium. I ask how he knows he\u2019\
  s a lesbian. He slides his finger though the ring pull of Fanta and yanks it off.\
  \ He says, the same way I know.\n\nBernado, his love Ana and I board a train. We\
  \ listen to Ces\xE1ria \xC9vora on Bernado\u2019s shattered Android,\n\u201CSodade\
  \ sodade Sodade\u2026\u201D\nLonging, longing, longing... \n\u201CMeg, bitch! Beautiful\
  \ song.\u201D Says Ana.\n\nWe arrive at a small house next to the village church\
  \ on a hill. Angela emerges from the bougainvillea waving both hands. She flicks\
  \ Bernado\u2019s ring pull earring. He is little bits of lost Lisbon. Ana laughs.\
  \ He smiles at her like she\u2019s every shiny thing he\u2019s ever looked for.\
  \ Each Friday on Facebook he tags her, writes, \u201CIt\u2019s Friday I\u2019m in\
  \ love,\u201D and posts a picture of a famous couple. Yesterday was Frida and Diego\
  \ digitally enhanced. Diego standing in high pants over a bulbous gut. Freda sitting\
  \ in a shawl. \n\nAna likes love on Fridays but has reservations about Bernado\u2019\
  s Donald Duck impersonation. I was in a pool when I first heard it. Bernado bobbed\
  \ around where I surfaced then delivered an indecipherable scramble of tongue and\
  \ throat at me which I should\u2019ve understood, with such strong ties to American\
  \ culture. Baffled, I duck dived back into the blue.\nLater Ana told me, \n\u201C\
  Uff...He can be a little heavy. He makes a duck noise\u201D and waved her arm dismissively\
  \ at the Atlantic. \n\nAna arranges boiled snails on a plate. Angela talks Virgos.\
  \ Angela, a fresh divorcee, has become a self-appointed fortune teller. She only\
  \ speaks of fortune, yet traces of her misfortunes show whenever conversations tangent.\
  \ On the couch I sing my favourite Bjork lyrics to Bernado,\n\u201CI\u2019m a fountain\
  \ of blood...\u201D He smiles,\n\u201CI worked with Bjork. 3 weeks in an England\
  \ house..\u201D\n\u201CWhat!?\u201D I sit up.\n \u201CYes. My friend needed help\
  \ with scotch. Black scotch...?\u201D\n\u201CDuct tape.\u201D\n\u201CDuck?\u201D\
  \ Bernado sits up, \u201CLike Donald?\u201D\n\u201CYeah...\u201D I glance at Ana,\
  \ she sucks a snail from its home; my least favourite sound in Portugal.\n\nWhen\
  \ Bernado and his friend arrived at the english house Bjork was outside, naked.\n\
  \u201CI thought, Bjork! But her dress?\u201D\nBjork shook Bernado\u2019s hand, said\
  \ she works naked and he and his friend are welcome to be naked for 3 weeks as they\
  \ tape down the electricity around her. Panicked his friend turned to Bernado who\
  \ was busy removing his safety pinned cargo shorts trying not to stab himself. \n\
  \u201CWe all sat naked to watch the music video, me, Bjork, director, chef...but\
  \ my friend always jeans and shirt...\u201D\n\u201CMeu Dues!\u201D Ana and Angela\
  \ are at the window. Bernado and I run over. \n\nThe sky explodes with tiny strobing\
  \ lights. Millions of stars pop out of existence, returning immediately. We grab\
  \ at hands. \n\nI have no reference for naked Bjork, for this canvas of exploding\
  \ stars. I feel like Bernado\u2019s friend standing in plain old jeans next to a\
  \ star. For 60 seconds our mouths are open, our arms entangled. If the stars paused\
  \ they\u2019d see a tiny window with 4 little heads squished into frame and one\
  \ who managed to stick a silver sticker from a tobacco packet above his eye without\
  \ anyone noticing.\n\nWhen it\u2019s over it\u2019s darker than I\u2019ve ever felt.\
  \ We sit quietly in shared satisfaction. Fortunes don\u2019t need telling and Bjork\
  \ naked is, just as she sings it, a fountain of blood in the shape of a girl. \n\
  \nIn the morning I sit outside, Ana and Bernado appear arm in arm. \n\u2018Bom dia!\u2019\
  \ The sun catches a piece of metal Bernado has found at the church and strikes my\
  \ eyes. \n\u201CMeg, bitch,\u201D says Ana. I squint up at her.\n \u201CAll the\
  \ stars! Pew pew pow...! \u201C Bernado, triggered by mouth antics, enters a Donald\
  \ Duck frenzy. Ana, peels off the sticker still hanging onto his eyebrow and runs,\
  \ stars exploding from her mouth. He pursues her, hopelessly behind. I lay back\
  \ in the sun and the warmth left by all the stars that were."
