Text: "I could not breathe. As surprisingly clean the air was, it was so humid I just\
  \ could not breathe properly. My mind did not seem to care about that though. It\
  \ was the brightest day I had ever seen. Perfectly manicured green grass, luscious\
  \ trees filled with leaves and clear blue skies. I was in awe. Lehigh valley was\
  \ nothing like the grey skies, tall buildings, polluted air, concrete jungle USA\
  \ I had imagined I would find.\nAlong with big bad cities I imagined I would find\
  \ blunt and abrupt people at every corner. Boy was I wrong. Strangers were greeting\
  \ and smiling at me in the hallways and opening doors for me. I was pleasantly surprised.\
  \ The people were actually more neighborly than they had been portrayed on television.\
  \ Maybe even more neighborly than people in my home country. I quickly learned that\
  \ the United Sates I saw on television was far different than where I was.\n\nI\
  \ had been good at commercial subjects all my life. I loved saving money. My sister\
  \ even called me frugal. It only seemed right that I follow the accounting stream.\
  \ In varsity I soon discovered that it was not my passion. My worries were verified\
  \ when I got an internship at a non-profit organization where I would be dealing\
  \ with the admin of sponsors. I spent hours looking at a screen. My brain was numb\
  \ and dare I say, I hated it. It made me realize I needed to find my passion and\
  \ fast!\n\nEvery Friday our group would have a class to learn about all things American.\
  \ One chilly Friday afternoon we were joined by the Chief of Diversity of our college,\
  \ Mr. Scott Blair, and he gave us a lesson on American history. Particularly, the\
  \ civil rights movement. I was moved. I could totally relate. The history seemed\
  \ so similar to that of South Africa. I chimed in at every opportunity. I was in\
  \ my zone and then it hit me. This is it. This is my passion. I love history.\n\n\
  I remembered when I was in grade 9 we learned about historical social injustices\
  \ in social studies class that year. Particularly about Rwanda, South Africa and\
  \ Germany. I enjoyed that class so much that year, got a score of 98% and was awarded\
  \ at prize giving. I could remember exacted dates, names and events. The similarities\
  \ of each event just at different places and at different times were so fascinating.\
  \ The pictures and accounts were so gripping. I loved it then and I love it now.\n\
  \ \nThroughout my life, I had always found myself in leadership positions. On the\
  \ first day at my primary school I was hand-picked by my teacher to sing the school\
  \ for the rest of the class. I was pretty excited about school. Before I could take\
  \ on any real leadership position my peers had already garnered me the nickname\
  \ Judge Judy because I would always try to mediate and find common ground any time\
  \ there were fights. I was elected to be part of the student council in my final\
  \ year in primary school. I was also elected to be a school and hostel monitor in\
  \ high school. Leadership had always seemed to find me and thrust me into these\
  \ positions. \n\nDuring varsity I found myself in a shell. I did not participate\
  \ in any clubs nor did I participate in any leadership roles. When I came to the\
  \ US on a scholarship that focused on leadership among other things, I feared I\
  \ had lost my touch. I soon learned that you do not have to be in a leadership position\
  \ to be a leader. Throughout the program I felt like a leader and acted like a leader.\
  \ I got elected to be the treasurer of the International Student Organization and\
  \ it just felt right. I just had to put myself out there.\n\nI found many things\
  \ during my ten month stay in the United States. I found a healthy, happy community,\
  \ a clean, pleasant environment, long lasting connections, welcoming friends and\
  \ loving family but most importantly, I found my passion and the leader in me. I\
  \ found myself."
