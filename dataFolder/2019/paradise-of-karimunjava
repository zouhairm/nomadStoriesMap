Text: "Today, 23 July 2016\n\nI go to Karimunjava, Jepara, Central Java. The islands\
  \ in north Java Sea. I'm so glad, I can visit it like the dream. Because I want\
  \ go to there one year ago and canceled. Now, the first I must go to Kartini Harbor,\
  \ Jepara for crossing over to Karimunjawa Harbor. Because it's saturday they have\
  \ only slow boat or called Siginjai boat with five hours crossing and will be leave\
  \ from Kartini Harbor at 07.00 am. \nI see my watch, now at 06.45 and the announcement\
  \ of the boat are ringing.\n\"Bebbb, bebbb\", twice announcement are ringing, the\
  \ once at 06.30 am for passangger to in the boat because the boat will be leave\
