Text: "\u201CDon't tell Angela!\u201D \n\nThese were the words my dad whispered in\
  \ my step mom's ear, choking back the tears, after suffering a massive stroke. Under\
  \ no circumstance, not even his quickly deteriorating health, was I to cancel my\
  \ trip to Ireland, that was scheduled to begin just two short weeks later. Sensibly\
  \ (and for which I will be eternally grateful), my step-mom didn't keep that  promise.\
  \ I made the long journey to see my dear dad in hospital, before his passing two\
  \ days later. Even though he was in such a vulnerable position, my dad put my dreamy\
  \ want ahead of his immediate need. \n\nThis first solo trip abroad was bound to\
  \ be the most meaningful. \n...............................................................\n\
  Before traveling to the Emerald Isle, I was continuously assured \u2013 by Irish\
  \ kin, of course \u2013 that the Irish are warm-hearted, welcoming and above all\
  \ else, the most genuine people you will ever meet.  Truth be told, I was a bit\
  \ apprehensive. After all, there is no such thing as being overly cautious for a\
  \ woman traveling solo, even for one who has all of her wits. Preparing for my journey\
  \ (aka logistical nightmare), I ensured to have copies of documentation and credit\
  \ cards, cash hidden in every nook, a backup phone, a flashlight and an emergency\
  \ kit... not to mention sensible footwear! My dad taught me well.\n\nAlthough leery,\
  \ my sons always refer to me as \u201Ccringey\u201D because I will talk to anyone.\
  \ It was refreshing to see that in Ireland this is a natural phenomenon. At the\
  \ airport and need to know where to catch the bus into Dublin? Ask a uniformed passerby.\
  \ Too disoriented to decipher one of the maps stashed in your purse? Ask the person\
  \ standing on the street  corner for directions. Waiting in line to pay for your\
  \ late supper of chips and off-sales? Chat up the homeless fellow who warns you\
  \ to watch your purse! Now this is what traveling is all about: interaction with\
  \ the locals. Okay, so maybe a gal can be cautious and friendly at the same time!\
  \ After all, I am wearing those sensible boots, so what is the worst that can happen?\n\
  \nHow about getting whisked away (literally!) while meandering through a poorly\
  \ lit footpath by a couple you vaguely noticed earlier, as you sat devouring your\
  \ supper in a pub off the beaten path, that's what! Although my mind was racing\
  \ in a flurry \u2013 Did they plot my demise while I was eating my fish and chips?\
  \ Why are they walking so fast? Just where do all of these doors and hallways lead\
  \ anyway? \u2013 I must admit that deep down \u2013 albeit with weighted heart \u2013\
  \ I was ready for an adventure. \n\nThis fast-footed couple were greeting people\
  \ as we speedily made our way to...  a well hidden beer garden, and were soon surrounded\
  \ by outdoor heaters, cheerful laughter and magical twinkle lights. I was hypnotized\
  \ by their welcoming smiles and soon realized that kidnappers these two definitely\
  \ were not! M and M were a hard-working, middle-aged couple out on a date, who took\
  \ pity on the solo woman traveler. Leaning in for answers, they were curious as\
  \ to why I would want to travel without my family; genuinely interested in my apparent\
  \ dilemma. And so, there it was: two pints, seriously condensed versions of our\
  \ lives, and 22 minutes later (they had a bus to catch!) an authentic friendship\
  \ was born. \n\nReturning to my hotel via the most direct route as recommended by\
  \ my new best friends, I was giddy with excitement. Not only did I get to discover\
  \ a part of Galway I never would have known existed, but trusting my instinct \u2013\
  \ while briefly putting caution aside \u2013 led to an adventure that cannot be\
  \ planned or bought in a pre-packaged holiday. \n\nEven though I could hear my dad's\
  \ words of caution ringing in my head, (sorry, dad)  I was needing to rely solely\
  \ on myself. This Irish adventure, my journey of the heart, reinforced how I need\
  \ to be true to myself, listen to my own inner voice, and follow the road less traveled\
  \ \u2013 all more valuable than mere words can express. This is life. And death.\
  \ And traveling in sensible shoes."
