Text: "Arriving at the camp was not really like I had expected it would be. We pulled\
  \ into a small road, just off the main highway to Athens, and arrived at the entrance\
  \ of a massive ex-military base. There was a large dusty football field that looked\
  \ abandoned, some giant army trucks badly painted with camouflage patterns, and\
  \ a few police and security personnel loitering around drinking iced coffees whilst\
  \ trying to find shade from the scorching Greek sun. We passed through security\
  \ easily, quickly flashing our identifications. \n\nOnce inside the camp we followed\
  \ a dirt path past a giant tent and various shower and toilet huts, before reaching\
  \ our destination. Quickly our team got to work and started placing colourful foam\
  \ mats under the shade of a big tree, ready to do activities with the children.\
  \  Two young boys came straight up to us, toying with water balloons that were apparently\
  \ left over from the previous days water fight. They were smiling, relaxed, and\
  \ about to soak us. It was only in the evening, when I got back to the apartment\
  \ that it dawned on me that these were the first two refugees I had ever seen. They\
  \ looked so normal, so happy, and so carefree. The two boys were followed by some\
  \ adorable sisters who were overly friendly. Next we were approached by a beautiful\
  \ girl called Taqwa, in a filthy pink dress and leggings, who despite receiving\
  \ much instruction from Jenny, couldn\u2019t quite work out how to twirl around\
  \ to make her dress spin out like a princess. Everything was calm, everything seemed\
  \ normal, it didn\u2019t even feel like a refugee camp. The organisations on the\
  \ camp seemed to be trusted by the people, and the people seemed to have hope. \n\
  \nJust before I left to go to Greece I had read an article about Banksy\u2019s latest\
  \ offering to the graffiti world. He had painted a giant mural on the walls of Bridge\
  \ Farm Primary School, in my hometown of Bristol. Following up, he sent a letter\
  \ to the children of the school, inviting them to add to and change the mural as\
  \ they saw fit. In this letter he wrote \u201CRemember it\u2019s always easier to\
  \ get forgiveness than permission.\u201D\n\nBanksy, my local hero speaks a lot of\
  \ sense, and it got me thinking, sometimes forgiveness is not enough.  Sometimes\
  \ you need more. After the majority of the European borders were closed, and different\
  \ asylum privileges were granted to refugees depending upon their country of birth,\
  \ they started to separate camps by nationality.  Malakasa, the camp where I was\
  \ working, was home to around 1200 mainly Afghan refugees. They had abandoned a\
  \ country that had been savaged by war and violence for over 30 years, and that\
  \ arguably becomes increasingly dangerous day by day.  On the day that I left the\
  \ camp there was a deadly terrorist attack in Kabul which claimed the lives of over\
  \ 80 people, and left at least another 230 injured.  The refugees who are fleeing\
  \ their homes didn\u2019t ask for permission to come to Europe. They don\u2019t\
  \ need forgiveness, because they haven\u2019t done anything wrong. If you were in\
  \ their situation I am sure that you would do the same as them, you would leave.\
  \ What they need is hope!"
