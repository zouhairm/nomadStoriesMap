Text: "They've promised you undiscovered cities, but they haven't mentioned the glass\
  \ that will be filled every evening, when you'll be quietly sitting in the hallway\
  \ without your shoes, face or truth. When there will be no one to pray to, because\
  \ you've lost your god long time ago. They've promised you new faces, but they haven't\
  \ mentioned that you will still face women who waste the lifetime looking for the\
  \ right dresses to impress men who waste the lifetime trying to take these dresses\
  \ off. They've promised you wine and beer in every bar, but they haven't promised\
  \ you conversations. They've promised you relationships, oils, perfumes, rings and\
  \ forevers, but they haven't mentioned what to do if you find yourself running from\
  \ all, yelling and laughing, with the blood on your knees, as when you were eight\
  \ - twelve - nineteen. They've promised you springs, but they haven't told you about\
  \ the winters, when you won't be able to remember stories, names, smells or addresses,\
  \ yet still able to hum \"mean old levee taught me to weep and moan oh well oh well\"\
  . They've promised you maddening adventures, but they haven't mentioned the days\
  \ when explaining how to eat a plum to the stranger in the supermarket will be the\
  \ only exciting thing. They did not say a word about loneliness dancing with the\
  \ foreign wind in the middle of majestic landscapes. They did not teach you a thing\
  \ about missed trains, ferries, horizons sweet as all yellow, blue, purple I will\
  \ never wear again. \nPerhaps for the best, it would have penetrated my soul, I\
  \ think to myself while looking at the sky, measuring my life here and there. The\
  \ roadway, rain and the clouds are the same, my steps and a shadow - same. It is\
  \ me. It is me who have changed. \nGrowing with every odd word, place, loosing myself,\
  \ collecting laughter and maps - I am here. I did not expect to find... a scar on\
  \ my life, left by journeys. You will not come back the same, they said, and, my\
  \ god, they were right. I have spread bits of myself all over the word. \nCollect\
  \ me not, I am a child of these places."
