Text: "The harsh wind blowing mellowed and took the shape of a ribbon. It swirled\
  \ and danced between my naked legs. Ribbon was lighter than the chains that my fate\
  \ would bring. I looked as a giant wave rushed to the sandy beach to inhabit it\
  \ for a while and then dragged itself back to the sea, knowing that it will forever\
  \ be oblivious to the ecstasy that comes from permanence of occupying it forever.\
  \ I thought of his permanence in my life as he held my hand. I knew I have few days\
  \ before I, too, drag myself away from him.\n\nI closed my eyes. The beach with\
  \ its infinite sand and untiring waves was gobbled by the orange canvas that stretched\
  \ before me. Light made formless figures flicker on the canvas, he pulled me towards\
  \ him. It was time to go. I looked at the beach and hurriedly stacked everything\
  \ in my memory: the sand, the wind, boats floating on the horizon. I knew I will\
  \ reminiscence this moment and put all images together. I was certain that there\
  \ will be no gaps: everything was now preserved. \n\nThe pickle jar of memories\
  \ was filled with sweet and sour memories. The tangiest was the memory of letting\
  \ go of his hand as we walked in the labyrinth that was the Souk market. The streets\
  \ in the market were bustling with travelers. I imagined a world without these streets,\
  \ a desert with its scorching sun shunning everything that got close. I jolted.\
  \ I let go of his hand, only to hold it again. I was grateful for the welcoming\
  \ Dubai for its existence: its market, charming cobblestone streets of the market\
  \ and the sky that covered everything. For in these streets, I was walking with\
  \ someone I wanted to hold for years but could not. The gold jewelry glimmered in\
  \ the shops. The intricate designs boasted their makers in silence. In the next\
  \ street, shopkeepers kept huge bags of spices outside the shops. They politely\
  \ asked people to spend some money at their shops. They quizzed people passing by\
  \ on the names of the spices. Spices made people cross oceans in history and in\
  \ the Souk Market, their irresistible aromas made people quickly reach for their\
  \ wallets.\nWe kept walking. His body was a silhouette that had come to life. He\
  \ walked beside me and the fear of his body fading away in the dark to become a\
  \ silhouette again walked on the other side. I had eloped to be with him. Our countries\
  \ had waged many wars against each other. I knew I\u2019d never see the place where\
  \ he was born, grew up and told me the stories of. I would never get the visa. But\
  \ I knew what awaited me upon my return. It did not matter, not knowing was a bliss.\
  \ I opened the pickle jar for a sweet memory. He held me and told me that he would\
  \ never see the Taj Mahal in his home country without me. It just meant that he\
  \ would never see the Taj Mahal. Would I ever see him? I knew once I return to Pakistan,\
  \ I will be chained. \n\nPeople can make a sin out of everything for a woman: falling\
  \ in love, loving a man from a different religion, being happy. And they pick punishments\
  \ delightfully: honor killings, rapes, marriages against will, abuse. As we live,\
  \ we should pick our sins carefully. Ones that bring eternal happiness. Sometimes\
  \ with my shackles, I walk inside Taj Mahal. When I get tired, I open the pickle\
  \ jar. He walks beside me but never too fast. He knows that the chains are heavy."
