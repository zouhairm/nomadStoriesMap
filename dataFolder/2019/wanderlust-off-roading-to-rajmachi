Text: "These are one of those trips that you always wish you had taken a while ago,\
  \ and at the same time, not taken at all\u2026 Many a times we\u2019ve been trekking\
  \ to various destinations and most of the times, we take a car to the base-camp\u2026\
  \ Earlier it was a bike and now it\u2019s a car, thanks to my friend Swapnil\u2026\
  \ His Ritz I must say has done a lot of miles in the couple of years that he\u2019\
  s been on the road with it. Long stretch of lands across various states to weekend\
  \ getaways that have been really bumpy and super sleek at times. From grazing dirt\
  \ tracks inside villages of Vidarbha to stretching a two day trip all the way to\
  \ Indore and back to Mumbai.  And of course, the Alibaug, Kashid, Murud-Janjira\
  \ is something which has become a routine. Lonavala \u2013 Tiger Hills is of course\
  \ a destination which we do most of the times in the monsoon, but this time around\
  \ we did something else\u2026 And of course, this had to be the brainchild of my\
  \ ever enthusiastic best friend, also my college mate Swapnil himself. For those\
  \ who don\u2019t know him yet, well, we\u2019ve been friends for over 12 years now\
  \ and right from college both of us have been auto enthusiasts, me being the lesser\
  \ one and almost every other time just being on the listening end of his aspirations\
  \ and stories from various rallies, so much so, that I\u2019ve taken up interest\
  \ in Formula 1.\nMost of the times our trips have been adventurous, luxurious, crazy,\
  \ tiring and bewildering\u2026 But none like this. It was a Saturday morning and\
  \ Swapnil, Mangesh and I decided to leave early in the morning on this trip in his\
  \ Ritz\u2026"
