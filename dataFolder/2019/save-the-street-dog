Text: "He walks past the coffee shop, shirtless and covered in black dust from the\
  \ waist up. His stride is fierce and hosts purpose, power and poise, he absolves\
  \ himself of potential threat, he is control, steady and clear. Ive watched many\
  \ individuals leap into the garbage, usually in pairs, one holds the lid while the\
  \ other jumps in scavenges. As though it is natural he jumps into the bin and empties\
  \ its contents onto the street with determination and grace, he proceeds to tear\
  \ apart the contents with his teeth, creating a celebration confetti of human waste.\
  \ The expression of success is none the less than that of discovering treasure.\
  \ A slab of cooked steak, he rubs it against the pavement to remove the garbage\
  \ debris and he continues on, unaware of the attention his behaviour has evoked,\
  \ along with the agitation and disruption he has induced in the day to day activities.\
  \ \n\n \n\nHe does not project the need or desire for pity. He appears more liberated\
  \ that any of us orbiting him in todays story. For many the mind quickly leads to\
  \ the concept that he needs help, but could it be, that because he does not live\
  \ within the confines of what is \u2018acceptable behaviour\u2019 or the constructed\
  \ idea of how we are supposed to co-exist, potentially his comfort is unimpaired.\
  \ He does not even appear to notice others are present, he especially does not seem\
  \ concerned for the circulating reactions. He is a warrior, most definitely physically,\
  \ his mental structure and emotional wellbeing will forever be a curiosity. Where\
  \ does he go at night? Who are his friends? What is the most important thing for\
  \ him?\n\n \n\nWe naturally assume he requires assistance and \u2018a better life\u2019\
  \ but perhaps he is more free, than you and me. Living as a street dog, free of\
  \ etiquette. He spends the day searching for food, sleeping where and when it suits.\
  \ Perhaps no home to return to, taking the risk of going hungry in exchange for\
  \ the opportunity to not carry the fear of loosing possessions, relieved of answering\
  \ questions and attempting to prove something. If he had the opportunity, would\
  \ he change it?"
