Text: "I keep glancing at my phone to check the time. It\u2019s creeping forward as\
  \ time does, but I grow progressively more anxious as it nears 5:00pm. I look outside\
  \ our cab and see mostly motorbikes, and a few cars trying to inch forward through\
  \ the incredible traffic that appears to be normal for HaNoi. There are orange trees,\
  \ boxes, and even long metal poles impossibly fashioned to the small vehicles. \
  \ And yet, their drivers move with ease and confidence through the streets. My friend\
  \ in the front seat is being reminded by her Apple Watch to \u2018breathe\u2019\
  \ as she watches the chaos. I chuckle at this, despite being a bit stressed as well.\
  \  \n\nWe pull up in front of an alleyway that leads to our airbnb. I check the\
  \ time again and it\u2019s now 4:45. Given the traffic, I am hesitant to call another\
  \ cab to get to our next destination. We grab our belongings and run down the alleyway\
  \ as if it isn\u2019t our first time doing so. In the span of five minutes, we dump\
  \ our bags on the ground and decide that the best way to get there is on foot. With\
  \ my phone in my hand to navigate us through the Old Quarter, we literally hit the\
  \ ground running through the city. \n\nI lead the way around motorbikes parked on\
  \ the sidewalk, past chairs and small tables where people are eating, over buckled\
  \ sidewalk, and squeeze between cars. Exhaust and dust swirls around us as our lungs\
  \ take in the dense air. I haven\u2019t run in a while, but I feel energized and\
  \ alive from the spirit of the city. We pass many trees with twisted trunks, their\
  \ leaves enveloping the sky. Shops with eccentric goods catch my eye and some people\
  \ try to beckon us inside. I am focused on navigating, but I can\u2019t help but\
  \ take in everything around me.\n\nIt\u2019s almost 5:00 and we are so close. A\
  \ symphony of incessant honks do little to remind us of the constant danger of crossing\
  \ the street. We have already passed intersections of traffic that push onward without\
  \ hesitation. I get the impression that people here keep moving forward. Thinking\
  \ now about the war from over 40 years ago, I sense resilience and determination\
  \ to keep that momentum going. We certainly feel it as we continue to tear down\
  \ the streets through the unknown. \n\nWe finally cross a large roundabout, and\
  \ I know we will make it on time if we are not hit by a car first. I see the sign\
  \ for the Thang Long Water Puppet Theater just as it hits 5:00. The three of us\
  \ look around for our tour guide, panting, and probably looking a bit worse for\
  \ wear. I spot him and approach him, introducing myself. He smiles and does the\
  \ same. \n\n\u201CIs this your first time here?\u201D \n\n\u201CYeah. We actually\
  \ ran here because we didn\u2019t want to be late.\u201D I put my hands on my hips\
  \ to steady myself.\n\n\u201CWow. I guess that means you\u2019re ready to eat some\
  \ food.\u201D He motions for us follow him through the crowds of people. \n\n\u201C\
  Yes.\u201D We answer in emphatic tandem.\n\n\u201CThen let\u2019s get started. Welcome\
  \ to Vietnam.\u201D"
