Text: "The Ottoman Trace in Berat, \"the city of a thousand windows\" in Albania\n\
  \nLocated next to the Osum River, in the center of Albania, the city of Berat was\
  \ known as the city of a thousand windows during the communist era.\n\nBERAT, Albania\n\
  \nBy: Camilo Hern\xE1ndez\n\nInside Albania there is a city that still preserves,\
  \ intact, its 19th century Ottoman architecture, Berat. This city, bathed by the\
  \ waters of the Osum River, is crossed by a typical Ottoman bridge in stone and\
  \ is adorned by white houses with wooden structures and thousands of windows.\n\n\
  The city, also capital of the municipality of Berat, was declared in 2008 as a World\
  \ Heritage Site by UNESCO for its historical and cultural legacy. Berat is known\
  \ to be one of the oldest cities in Albania, as its first settlements date back\
  \ to the 4th century BC.\n\nThe domain of Berat has gone through several hands throughout\
  \ history. Being inhabited by the tribe of the Illyrians, of which the Albanians\
  \ are descendants, Berat was dominated by the Romans, the Byzantine Empire, the\
  \ Bulgarians, the Serbs and finally the Ottoman Turks, who maintained control of\
  \ the current territories of Albania from the 15th century until 1912.\n\nWhere\
  \ does its name come from?\n\nWhen the city was under Serbian domination the name\
  \ of Beligrad (the white city) was given to the place, with the passage of time\
  \ it was transformed until acquiring its current name: Berat. During the communist\
  \ dictatorship in Albania that began in 1946 until 1992, with the arrival to power\
  \ of Enver Hoxha, the city was known as \"the museum city\" and the \"city of a\
  \ thousand windows\".\n\nThe castle of Berat\n\nIn the highest mountain of the city\
  \ there is a castle that houses the remains of what was at some point in history\
  \ a city in itself. Orthodox churches and Ottoman mosques still remain inside the\
  \ castle, giving testimony of the past of the city and of all Albania.\n\nThe Onufri\
  \ museum\n\nThe Cathedral of the Assumption of Saint Mary, located at the highest\
  \ point of the castle of Berat, preserves the pictorial legacy of the master Onufri\
  \ of Neokastro, an orthodox archbishop and Albanian artist, from the Elbasan region,\
  \ in the 16th century. His pictorial legacy is housed in a museum of his name, right\
  \ inside the church complex.\n\nRight under the castle of Berat is Magalem, one\
  \ of the neighborhoods that still retains the characteristic white Ottoman houses\
  \ with wooden structure. From a distance, the houses of Magalem seem to be built\
  \ one on top of the other. Over the years, hundreds of artists and photographers\
  \ have visited this complex of houses, symbol of Berat and legacy of Albania.\n\n\
  The Ottoman bridge of Gorica\n\nOne of the references of Berat is the great Ottoman\
  \ bridge of Gorica, which crosses the Osum River and connects the neighborhood of\
  \ Magalem with Gorica. Being one of the oldest Ottoman bridges in all Albania, the\
  \ stone bridge of Gorica, with its seven arches, testifies to the tangible and living\
  \ presence of the Ottoman Turks in the Balkan Peninsula.\n\nNote: I\u2019m a Colombian\
  \ freelance journalist and I contributed to the Turkish news agency (Anadolu Agency)\
  \ in the Spanish Desk. This new story was originally written in Spanish by me. \
