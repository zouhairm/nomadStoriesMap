Text: "Every morning in Mumbai I would wake up to the sound of pots being shuffled\
  \ around and milk being brought to a boil. I would sit down with my grandmother\
  \ and we would have our first cup of chai for the day. Then, with the scent of cardamom\
  \ heavy in the humid air, the true travel began. \n\nWhile visiting India brought\
  \ with it many of the normal escapades of exploring local restaurants and seeing\
  \ the Gateway of India; I traveled further every morning with the faint light of\
  \ the sunrise illuminating my grandmother\u2019s face. In that soft spotlight she\
  \ would begin her tales. \n\nShe told me about her homes. \n\nIn Pakistan she was\
  \ raised in the modest city of Peshawar, and still has fond memories of walking\
  \ alongside the almond trees with her sister, and of playing with the baby yak on\
  \ their farm. She described the trees as my sister and I walked alongside her in\
  \ the Maheshwari Udyan gardens, gazing up towards the Ashoka trees, imagining small\
  \ almond flowers blooming on the regal limbs. She told me how she and her sister\
  \ had the same colored eyes, and how she always thought her sister\u2019s sparkled\
  \ just a little bit more. They particularly shone as they stole some of the sweet\
  \ almonds from under the watchful eyes of the British officers patrolling the roads.\
  \ My own little sister\u2019s eyes gleamed as she laughed, hearing the story and\
  \ eating pani puri from out of my hands. Guiding me through her tale, my grandmother\u2019\
  s eyes crinkle into a smile as she reminisced about her and her sister hiking up\
  \ their shalvars to run through the dirt road to get home from school. The dirt\
  \ from Mumbai\u2019s busy streets kicking up into our eyes. My grandmother\u2019\
  s sister was her soulmate, everything they did, they did together.\n \nHer words\
  \ took me through Partition, where her first home was lost. She described the flames\
  \ that engulfed her city as everyone turned against their neighbors. Lifelong friendships\
  \ were obliterated as the nation was split apart. My grandmother lost her family.\
  \ Unstoppable mobs had swarmed their home as her mother and servants tried in vain\
  \ to protect her little sister. The heat of the flames scalded my skin as my grandmother\
  \ spoke, their screams echoing around us. The life she had known was lost, along\
  \ with her loved ones, and her beloved sister. My own sister and I leaned into one\
  \ another, the story haunting us as we wandered around Lokhandwala market, unable\
  \ to imagine the horror of losing the other in order to step foot here in India.\n\
  \n I felt her pain as she described getting on a plane for the first time to escape\
  \ Partition, and how in taking off she didn\u2019t know that she would never see\
  \ those almond trees and her little yak again, nor would she see her sister\u2019\
  s eyes sparkle as they played. Her own plane ride stood in stark opposition to my\
  \ own, her dread of the unknown so different than the longing and excitement I felt\
  \ as I stepped onto the plane on my way to see her. \n\nMy grandmother described\
  \ the days she spent at the airport in India, hoping to hear word of her family\
  \ over the radio there. As she tells me these stories we cry together at her joy\
  \ of hearing that her father was alive and in a refugee camp in Delhi. Her father\
  \ and uncle worked to piece the family back together, building homes next door to\
  \ one another in Delhi, and hoping their wounds would someday heal. But they never\
  \ truly did. Every time my grandmother tells me another story of the war, her wounds\
  \ reopen, but each soft tear that shines in the morning sun helps me understand\
  \ that every person lost in the war is a part of her soul. I understand how she\
  \ carried each person with her from home to home, rebuilding  her life with the\
  \ love she never lost. \n\nWhen I travel through India I see the physical home she\
  \ built with her family, but traveling through her stories I see the home that built\
  \ her."
