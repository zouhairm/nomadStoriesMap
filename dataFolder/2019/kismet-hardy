Text: "KISMET, HARDY.\n\nCape Trafalgar is a bleak headland set between Gibraltar\
  \ and Cadiz. Windswept. Empty. Not a souvenir stall in sight. Nothing but a mini-lighthouse\
  \ enclosed in a dilapidated fence to indicate that one of history\u2019s greatest\
  \ naval battles took place just a few miles off-shore. But then history, like time,\
  \ is relative to your point of view. Trafalgar established once and for all that\
  \ Britannia ruled the waves. And the Spanish not only lost - they lost big time.\n\
  \n    In 1805 Spain was an occupied nation, with Napoleon\u2019s loathed, alcoholic\
  \ brother, Joseph, perched precariously on the Iberian throne. The combined \u2018\
  allied\u2019 Franco/Spanish fleet detested each other. The Spanish Admiral Carlos\
  \ Gravina was an excellent, skilled sailor. But the \u2018little corporal\u2019\
  , hot shit on land but clueless about naval warfare and putting national honour\
  \ before good sense, appointed Villeneuve, an inexperienced Frenchman, as overall\
  \ commander. His brief \u2013 to obliterate the British navy and with it his personal\
  \ bete noir. That one eyed, one armed, seducer of Ambassador\u2019s wives, whose\
  \ very name sent a shudder down every sea-going spine. Lord Horatio Nelson. No pressure\
  \ then.\n\n    The \u2018allied\u2019 fleet were berthed in Cadiz. Even though they\
  \ had greater fire power (2,857 cannon compared to England\u2019s 2,148) and the\
  \ Spanish officer class were considered to be among the best in Europe, what crews\
  \ they had were ill-trained, ill-disciplined and ill-fed. Due to admiralty incompetence\
  \ and widespread corruption, most hadn\u2019t been paid in three or four years.\
  \ Many officers were forced to use their own money to prevent outright mutiny. Moral\
  \ was at an all-time low. This against the piratical hard men who were Blighty\u2019\
  s Jolly Jack Tars. \n\n    So the decision was taken to stay safe in harbour and\
  \ allow the enemy to mount a siege. With luck, went the reasoning, Nelson would\
  \ eventually get tired and go away. Unfortunately, neither French arrogance nor\
  \ Spanish machismo had been taken into consideration. During a council of war, one\
  \ of Villeneuve\u2019s lackeys called Spanish courage into question. Outraged, Gravina\
  \ allegedly leapt to his feet shouting \u2018To the ships. Last man on board\u2019\
  s a coward\u2019 and the fateful di was cast. Individual captains were reduced to\
  \ sending press-gangs to scour the taverns of Cadiz for every drunk and incapable\
  \ they could find to make up the numbers. When the combined fleet went out to face\
  \ the British next day, not only was the wind against them, the majority of those\
  \ on board had never been to sea before. Cannon fodder. Entire crews spent the battle\
  \ throwing up, blood and guts mixing with vomit as Nelson cut a swathe through the\
  \ line and made mincemeat of them. The smell alone must have been enough to kill\
  \ you.\n\n    Villeneuve, followed by four other French vessels, fled the scene\
  \ in his flagship without having fired a shot, leaving the leaderless fleet to its\
  \ own devices.  He was captured off Finisterre three days later and ransomed back\
  \ to Paris where he had the good grace to \u2018do the decent thing\u2019, before\
  \ the Emperor could have him shot.\n\n    Fourteen Franco/Spanish ships were sunk\
  \ in the affray, five captured. The British lost not a single one. Though they did\
  \ chalk up 449 dead and 1,241 wounded. The Franco/Spanish headcount came to 3,243\
  \ fatalities, a figure that would have been greatly enhanced during the next few\
  \ days as those of their 2,538 wounded who hadn\u2019t been dumped overboard to\
  \ facilitate the retreat, succumbed to gangrene, infection or just plain shock.\
  \ No penicillin in those days. No anaesthetic. A swig of rum and a belt to bite\
  \ on the only comfort while your leg was taken off with a blunt knife, the operation\
  \ oftimes performed by the ship\u2019s barber on a bloody table in a smoke-filled\
  \ hold, if the surgeon had already been blown to smithereens.\n\n    So Lord Horatio\
  \ won. Not that he lived to tell the tale. A lucky shot carried him off mid battle,\
  \ leaving his beloved Emma to eventually die in gin-sodden penury. Kismet Hardy.\
  \ The suit in which he passed away is currently on view at the Greenwich Maritime\
  \ Museum, bloodstains included at no extra charge. But at Trafalgar - nothing. Maybe\
  \ now you can understand why?"
