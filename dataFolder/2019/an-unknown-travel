Text: "I sit on the chair in front of home, trying to enjoy the atmosphere under the\
  \ sunlight. Watching the sun which light the earth beautifully, hearing the sound\
  \ of birds which can fly away free and  some of them still nets on the tree. Feeling\
  \ and enjoying all of that by seeing it from far. Imagine of what birds talk, where\
  \ the birds fly go. And realize or not , those stuff just bring my mind into some\
  \ of place I never go before. Freely and wildly, my mind just go to some place I\
  \ never go, and knowing all of stuff that I consider whether it was real or not,\
  \ whether the place does really exist or that\u2019s just the part of my imagination.\
  \ Part of memories on my brain. \n\nMaybe this is a little bit abstract to understand.\
  \ But here I\u2019d just like to share about my experience of mind travel, where\
  \ besides of the story above, it is just not rare occur to me. I\u2019ve also ever\
  \ been in something like when seeing some photos or watching travel on tv, my mind\
  \ just go at that place and starting to, kind of imagine what things that exist\
  \ on that place. For example, i see grand canyon picture on the internet, without\
  \ realizing I started to go inside the picture. Feeling the atmosphere there, thinking\
  \ about what things that exist overthere eventhough I\u2019m not sure about either\
  \ what I think or feel is really exist or that is just my imagination or wild-free\
  \ thought?\n\nAnd if I told this to people, the must be hard to understand. Probably\
  \ it goes different for them who ever had same thing with me or them who knows about\
  \ this. But I called it as \u201Cmind travel\u201D. Mind travel maybe sound like\
  \ same as imagination or day-dreaming, which they may look bad or sounds weird for\
  \ us. Eventhough both of them can bring something good, like whether or not we will\
  \ know something we never see or meet before. we\u2019re may able to create something\
  \ which never exist from that imagination or day dreaming. But we need to know that,\
  \ mind travel a bit different with day-dreaming or imagination. I said that mind\
  \ travel need something to triggered for, and I\u2019ve ever read it too it is used\
  \ for meditation for healing and others. \nFor me travel it doesn\u2019t have to\
  \ explore physically, seeing something that really exist, feeling something that\
  \ we can see, but through our mind, either we realize or not we can also do it with\
  \ our mind. Because our thought just like infinity. Thing that we can get stress,\
  \ being innovative or creative, imagine something are things we can get through\
  \ our mind. So do traveling, we can also get it through our mind despite of it doesn\u2019\
  t tend to be real or we can see it but the point is we get the aesthetic from that\
  \ travel. Peace with inside of ourself. \n\nIt\u2019s just a way to get the free\
  \ thought, free soul, although it is kind of weird thing. So that\u2019s all the\
  \ things I could share through this written about my \u201Ctravel\u201D. \n\nThis\
  \ just someone quote to close this,\n \n\u201C a good traveler is one who knows\
  \ how to travel with mind.\u201D \u2013 Michael Bassey Johnson."
