Text: "I'm goig to tell you my first travel story. I was 15 years old when I took\
  \ my first plane alone. It was the Easter period and I was leaving to Germany, going\
  \ to meet my pen friend for the first time. I still remember when i saw her at the\
  \ airport, a little girl with red hair, green eyes and such a big smile. Apparently,\
  \ we were so different but I would soon discover how much two people could be connected\
  \ together. \nIn the car, going to her house, in a small town in the middle of the\
  \ West Germany called Grefrath, i saw the most beautiful green grasslands and blue\
  \ sky I've ever seen. We didn't speak a lot in the car, i had a bad German in that\
  \ period as she had not a good Italian. \nWhen we arrived home I met all her family\
  \ and immediately fell in love with their farm. The sun was shining and we decided\
  \ to have a trip to a small lake there. We went swimming in that cold water, we\
  \ laughed and seemed we've always been friends. Those days I had long talks and\
  \ cups of tea with her old Grandma, walks in the woods, I fed animals with her brother\
  \ and i painted Easter eggs with her little cousins. \nWhen it was time to leave,\
  \ i was unexpectedly tanned, full of love but sad. Didn't know how soon I could\
  \ meet that people again. My friend and I both cried during a big hug at the airport.\
  \ \nNow, after ten years, everything changed but that German farm is still my favourite\
  \ Easter destination. Unfortunately, my friend's Grandma isn't alive anymore but\
  \ her cousins, teenagers at the moment, are still waiting for me to paint the eggs.\
  \ \nI didn't expect to find a family there."
