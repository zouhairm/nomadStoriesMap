Text: "It is early morning and I am still yawning and adjusting in my seat to take\
  \ a short nap before the sun rays break out.\n\nOur driver is a zealous man, who\
  \ likes to talk. \u201CVery excited to see the tiger? You will surely see one.\u201D\
  \ He assured and engaged us in a recent incident \u201CTwo days ago, a villager\
  \ was found dead, covered in mud, blood and scratches of a tiger\u2019s claw rooted\
  \ deep on his neck and shoulders.\u201D He paused. \u201CDon\u2019t worry; the tiger\
  \ is declared \u2018a man-eater\u2019 and is kept in seclusion. You must go; there\
  \ is nothing to fear with our guide.\u201D He pats the Guide\u2019s shoulder who\
  \ is now smiling in vain.\n\nI am gradually slipping in my seat till my neck is\
  \ stuck at an utmost awkward angle, thinking perhaps my mother was right, haven\u2019\
  t I seen a tiger in Zoo\u2026\n\nIt is 5.20 am, the next day and I am shivering\
  \ while brushing my teeth, as the jungle winter chill has quietly seeped into my\
  \ bones, making my teeth chatter. We have booked the earliest morning Safari at\
  \ 6 am deemed to be the best time as animals come out to drink water across the\
  \ Jungle.  I am excited for my first jungle safari in the most enchanting national\
  \ parks, Bandhavgarh, the third most densely populated tiger reserve in India with\
  \ maximum chance of spotting the royal Bengal tiger.\n\nWe are ready for the pursue,\
  \ sitting in the open jeep, listening to our guide\u2019s strict instructions \u201C\
  stay quiet & still, do not stand or lean out, do not scream in fear or excitement\
  \ as that would unease the tiger.\" We drove for 20 minutes, spotting some hopping\
  \ monkeys, grazing deers, migratory birds, admiring the squirrel peekaboo amidst\
  \ dense forest trees and feeling lost with a purpose to find something.\n\nSuddenly,\
  \ the jungle had a murmur sound which amplified, and the guide took a U-turn. It\
  \ was the monkeys, passing the message from one tree to another to let the deers\
  \ know that the tiger is out. We all sat calmly, driver raced a bit, and then slowed\
  \ down to show us the spectacular scene\u2026 I was spellbound would be an understatement,\
  \ when I saw the herd of deers standing together covering the whole jungle ground\
  \ in my sight, listening carefully to the message with fear in their eyes as they\
  \ knew they\n must run for their lives. But, today the tigress was out to only quench\
  \ her thirst, the deers were safe.\n\nShe enters, raking in her majestic glory with\
  \ her two coy cubs, unaware of the real world, still toddling playfully under their\
  \ mother\u2019s protection, watching and guiding them to the pond. The cubs were\
  \ running, fighting, licking their claws, rubbing their backs on the ground, and\
  \ enjoying the morning sunshine.\n\nWe were watching them from a 50-meter distance\
  \ which gave us a good view and range to capture portrait shots. The Tigress sensed\
  \ our presence, but was familiar with jeeps at a distance. Suddenly, I felt my friend\
  \ clench my arm; she swallowed her gum, there was a villager crossing the jungle\
  \ road\u2026 I wonder if it was courage or ignorance.\n\nWe were now in a triangle,\
  \ our jeep, the tigress, and the villager, a middle aged man in his forties, holding\
  \ a long stick. My heart skipped a beat, hands folded in anticipation and images\
  \ from the early news kept flashing in my mind. My friend whispered, \u2018this\
  \ villager is dead, it is a fierce mother tigress.\u2019 I instinctively started\
  \ praying for both the villager and the tigress.\n\nIt was getting intense. The\
  \ Tigress looked confused and angry; the villager held tightly onto the stick and\
  \ exchanged glances with our guide. He stood still for a while, and then slowly\
  \ started walking towards us. The tigress turned, glaring at us, her chest has expanded,\
  \  now staring straight at the villager with her eyes  wide open,  claws intact,\
  \ neck and shoulders bent forward, head upright and mouth unwrapped.\n\nI witnessed\
  \ the tigress roar."
