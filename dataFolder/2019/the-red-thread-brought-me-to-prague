Text: "Overnight I booked a train ticket to Prague, and that is how my little journey\
  \ started. \nNothing was planned and I put the first things I found on the chair\
  \ in my bag. I was not even aware of what I was going to find, moved only by the\
  \ need of being on the run, discover a new place such as Prague, which was somehow\
  \ clear in my mind from Kafka\u2019s works. \nFrom Berlin, the train spinned fast\
  \ \u2018til the Czech Republic capital and I was amazed by the majestic sun of a\
  \ timid first day of April. \nLost, without internet and \u2013 most important \u2013\
  \ without a place where to sleep. But this was still not an urgent matter to solve.\
  \ \nI have started wandering from the main station, Praha hlavn\xED n\xE1dra\u017E\
  \xED, having a first glimpse of the local language which reminded me of my grandmother.\
  \ She used to tell me that when she was little she learnt in primary school Russian\
  \ instead of English and after that she would try to recall some words of the language,\
  \ counting numbers, saying the alphabet outloud. The musicality of Czech abruptly\
  \ brought up this memory of a slavic song in my mind. \nI had a great start and\
  \ even a better perception of my sorroundings. With a renewed energy, I took my\
  \ only bag and went down to the city centre, ready to catch more details from the\
  \ city. \nI was a little bit shocked at first when I found myself in the midst of\
  \ the turists chaos. \nI had not thought that we were in the middle of Easter holidays\
  \ and I was definitely not expecting a huge wave of heads in front of me. So I tried\
  \ to escape,  it was time to find a place where to sleep. \nFollowing the Vltava\
  \ river, from the Dancing House I decided to take the little roads on the back.\
  \ It was lunch time and the bells of a gothic church started to toll and in front\
  \ of it there was another historical building with a hostel sign. \nThere was it:\
  \ my roof, my bed, my safe place for the nights to come. \nAnyway, I found myself\
  \ living the city mostly from dusk to dawn, because during daylight, as mentioned\
  \ before, the city was packed with turists and it was difficult even to think. \n\
  The best night was when I went out for dinner alone at a tavern near the hostel.\
  \ In front of the place a huge clock was hung and from outside you could hear the\
  \ laughter and cheerful voices of people. Inside the tavern the tables were not\
  \ devided, it was a three rows of huge wooden boards and I found myself in front\
  \ of another \u201Clonely soul\u201D, another wanderer on his own. \nWe started\
  \ talking, as if we recognized our condition. He was a musician coming from Canada,\
  \ doing a solo trip around Europe and I was\u2026 I was a student.\nAfter dinner\
  \ we decided to take a walk together. The streets were empty and the silence was\
  \ filled by the sound of the wind and the rumble of the river. \nWe took Charles\
  \ Bridge and the statues were staring at us with a fierce and firm sight. The sensation\
  \ of being in one of Kafkas\u2019s books was so vivid, as with the gloomy atmosphere\
  \ all around us. The dream of being the protagonist of a novel suddenly became reality.\
  \ \nSlowly we reached the top, arriving at the highest point of the ancient part\
  \ of the city. The eye of the full moon above us, a brighter light compared to the\
  \ street lights. \nAnd in the end, my improvised friend took his classic guitar\
  \ and sang a song to the city while I contemplated the sleepy Prague before my eyes\
  \ and the wind whispered in my ear: welcome home."
