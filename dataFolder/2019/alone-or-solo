Text: "I was scared of travelling alone.\n\nTravelling is taking a leap of faith to\
  \ the unknown, as we don\u2019t know what will happen. Neither did I know what to\
  \ expect of this interrailing trip. I said to myself: \"even if you don\u2019t know\
  \ what will happen, we might as well go ahead and try.\" \n\nTravelling alone as\
  \ a woman is perceived to be high risk, but the actual risk of something bad happening\
  \ is very small. I believe opening borders to be the same, in terms of \"risk perception\"\
  . \n\nWhether if we let others enter our country or if we travel to other countries\
  \ is always a leap of faith. Yes, we are aware that there is a little possibility\
  \ of something going wrong, of unluckily encountering a bad person with bad intentions,\
  \ but you wouldn't stay at home in your own country just out of irrational fears.\n\
  \nThe trip was a once in a lifetime adventure, full of heart-warming conversations\
  \ with strangers, realizations on my ignorance, changes in my thinking process,\
  \ astounding beauty, cultural diversity, connections with people around the world\
  \ and practising self-loving through a lot of me time. \n\nI learn that travelling\
  \ on my own didn't mean travelling alone as there were plenty of people along the\
  \ way ready to offer me their confidence.\nThese people were waiting for no one\
  \ to join them on their adventures they just packed their bags and went. Choosing\
  \ a good hostel, meaning a backpackers, solo type of hostel with activities happening\
  \ constantly made 100% of my experience.\n\nI would recommend to everyone, especially\
  \ girls, to travel solo for a soul-filling, perspective-changing and confidence-pumping\
  \ adventure. \n\nUntil you experience it, you won't understand the difference between\
  \ alone and solo. I will tell you a little secret, they are complete opposites."
