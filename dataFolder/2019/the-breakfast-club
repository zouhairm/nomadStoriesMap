Text: "After landing into what seemed more like a shopping mall than an airport, I\
  \ walked out to a damp greeting from Kuala Lumpur at 7 am having slept through my\
  \ in-flight breakfast.\n\nNaturally my stomach was grumbling! Thankfully, the duo\
  \ who had come to receive me felt the same. I met Farid, my Malay host, and Dennis,\
  \ a Dane, over a year ago at youth conference in Myanmar; we had hit it off and\
  \ decided to do a small reunion trip.\n\nAs the car breezed past palm tree plantations\
  \ into the city, I decided it would a good time to make an expectation for this\
  \ vacation clear: \u201CFarid I will eat anything as long as I know I cannot find\
  \ that particular food item back in Pakistan,\u201D I announced. After all, I had\
  \ come all this way to experience the exotic country that the \u2018Malaysia-Truly\
  \ Asia\u2019 campaigns had promised; not for localized encounters.\n\nMy proclamation\
  \ prompted Farid to get us a meal he promised was a \u2018quintessential Malay breakfast\u2019\
  . We arrived at a dingy roadside diner enveloped by, of course, a palm tree and\
  \ covered by a sheet metal roof. As we took our seats I could hear the locals chattering\
  \ away in Malay while I took in the sights of the Proton vehicles parked outside\
  \ and the skyscrapers sprouting in between clumps of greenery. Farid then placed\
  \ orders of \u2018Teh-O-Ais\u2019 (iced tea) and \u2018rotai canai\u2019.\n\nEverything\
  \ felt just the right amount of exotic!\n\nExcept, the smell from the diner felt\
  \ oddly familiar- was it curry leaf that my mother would use in our kitchen? A feeling\
  \ of dread began to rise, but my rational side reminded me to trust Farid\u2019\
  s judgment.\n\nMy heart sunk a little when I saw a flatbread similar to a \u2018\
  paratha\u2019 served with lentil curry or \u2018dhal\u2019- a dish common in South\
  \ Asia. I put on a brave face and dug in.\n\nThe Rotai Canai tasted similar to a\
  \ paratha, but was flakier- akin to a pancake. The dhal had a familiar savory taste,\
  \ but stood out due to the sweet and nutty coconut milk flavor. Despite of my initial\
  \ disappointment, I began enjoying the odd mix of comforting familiarity and yet\
  \ distinct Malay twists that the dish had to offer.\n\nStrangely, at this moment\
  \ the figures of Dennis & Farid began to blur in front of me. \n\nFor a moment I\
  \ was transported to the streets of Karachi, where I would have similar flaky flatbreads\
  \ called lachay kai parathay on a patch of grass that acted as a road divider with\
  \ piping hot tea as I whiled away an evening with the boys. Next, I was sitting\
  \ in Muscat, enjoying the South Indian flatbread \u2018malabar parotha\u2019 with\
  \ buttered vegetables and pickled potatoes, before being snapped back to reality\
  \ as Dennis began planning how to best utilize our days in Malaysia.\n\nLater that\
  \ evening I tried to understand why the breakfast experience felt so intimate. It\
  \ turns out that Rotai Canai is a derivation of \u2018Roti from Chennai\u2019 as\
  \ the dish was brought over from India by Indian Muslims, fondly referred to as\
  \ \u2018Mamaks\u2019, and tweaked to suit the local tastes. I realized that my idea\
  \ of exotic was perhaps too romantic. \n\nWhat the \u2018Malaysia-Truly Asia\u2019\
  \ campaigns did not mention was the beauty of connectivity- that true exoticism\
  \ is simply a different expression of a common value.\n\nOver the course of my vacation\
  \ I began to see everything through the lens of connectivity- the kingly status\
  \ accorded to the Durian fruit by Malaysians was exactly the same as how Pakistanis\
  \ cherished their Mangoes. I observed how Indonesia and Malaysia were homogeneous\
  \ cultures, that spoke the same language, separated by borders- a bittersweet depiction\
  \ of what Pakistan and India could be with our shared heritage but hostile borders.\n\
  Ultimately though this vacation taught me how humans shared the same core values;\
  \ and appreciating the nuances of how we choose to celebrate and share them.\n\n\
  Exoticness is the expression of something familiar- with a refreshing twist."
