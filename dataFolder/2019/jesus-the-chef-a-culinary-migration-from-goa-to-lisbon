Text: "My cousin, Jason, a Goan-to- Lisbon transplant, first told me about Jesus.\
  \ Jesus Lee Fernandes (middle name given by his parents who loved Bruce Lee) is\
  \ something of a mini celebrity back in Panjim, where people have competing stories\
  \ about his background and his rise to culinary accomplishment. Today, he is the\
  \ successful owner and chef of a colorful, sixteen seat restaurant called \u201C\
  Jesus \xE9 Go\xEAs\u201D (\u201CJesus is from Goa\u201D), a few streets off of the\
  \ main Avenue da Liberdade. The walls of the restaurant are bright yellow with painted\
  \ homages to many different religious icons, saints, and gods, all smiling and plastered\
  \ in intense hues throughout the restaurant. The effect on the customer standing\
  \ dead center in the restaurant is like being the subject of an over- whelming panopticon\
  \ of pan-religious jolliness. On the front of the glass door is a frosted outline\
  \ and portrait of Jesus him-self, forever the guardian of the cosmic yellow space\
  \ with its spiral of saintly figures. When Jesus walks, he has a jaunt that seems\
  \ to match the sloping hills of Lisbon. Though he was born in Goa, Lisbon is his\
  \ hometown and there is barely a person he does not know as he works his way through\
  \ the Bairro Alto neighborhood, waving or offering a high five to a fellow restauranteur.\
  \ Watching him in real time is like watching a mythology unfold, a gentle giant\
  \ with contagious energy.\n\n\LOver the past few years, I have come to Lisbon every\
  \ summer and have been a frequent patron of this restaurant. It wasn\u2019t until\
  \ this past year that I decided that I wanted to write a focused piece on Jesus\
  \ and his story from homeless hustler to chef extraordinaire. \nGoa is the smallest\
  \ province in India and was colonized by Portugal from the mid 1500\u2019s until\
  \ 1961. The province, often cited as the \u201Cjewel\u201D of the Portuguese empire,\
  \ was granted more privileges of citizenship than Portugal\u2019s colonies in Africa.\
  \ In the beginning of the 20th century, when some autonomy was almost in reach for\
  \ Goa via the Republican Constitution of 1911 (which was to give Goans the same\
  \ rights as Portuguese citizens), Goans were suddenly officially regulated to second\
  \ class citizens when the Portuguese Republic fell in 1926. Under the rule of Ant\xF3\
  nio de Oliveira Salazar, the migration of Goans to Portugal declined significantly.\
  \ As freedom fighter Trist\xE3o B. da Cunha wrote, the Portuguese had \u201Creduced\
  \ Goan society to a grotesque caricature of the West and deprived it of the qualities\
  \ of originality and invention which are essential for real progress.\u201D\nYet\
  \ those Goans who had immigrated to Lisbon felt a strong sense of Portuguese identity\
  \ as Caroline Brettel suggests in her essay, \u201CPortugal\u2019s First Post-Colonials:\
  \ Citizenship, Identity, and the Repatriation of Goans.\u201D She states that Goans\
  \ \u201Cwho have resettled in the Portuguese metropole have carried with them a\
  \ hybrid indo-lusitanian heritage that is important to the construction of identity\
  \ and a sense of belonging.\u201D And while the rest of India was struggling with\
  \ its own recent independence, Goa became a contested space of authenticity between\
  \ Salazar and the new Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. The province finally\
  \ achieved independence in 1961, but this did not placate the feeling of having\
  \ a double identity for many who were scattered around the world. \n\nThe Goan diaspora\
  \ is small, but well connected. There is estimated to be about 300,000 Goans living\
  \ outside of India. This all too brief history lesson is encapsulated in the story\
  \ of Jesus. His rise to status is informed by this sense of overlapping identities,\
  \ Goan emigration politics, the messy history of Goan culinary development, Portugal\u2019\
  s imperial tolerance for racial but not religious difference\u2014 this all has\
  \ to do with Jesus and my fascination with the specific space he occupies as a seeker\
  \ and producer of multiple worlds."
