Text: "My cell phone rang. On the other end of the line, in perfect Italian and without\
  \ any inflection or accent, there was a girl. The Production Manager of a Roman\
  \ company that made documentaries for Rai TV, asked me: \"Would you be available\
  \ for a collaboration? Do you know the Hunters Squadron of Calabria? \"\nAnd I replied:\
  \ \"Who, the military? What do they have to do with marijuana plantations? \"\n\"\
  Yes, the special department of the Carabinieri arresting the fugitives, we are filming\
  \ a TV documentary about them.\"\nI still did not understand the nature of the collaboration\
  \ and ventured with a question: \"Do you need an interpreter from Calabrian dialect\
  \ to Italian?\"\nI heard the girl smile on the other side of the phone. \"Not really,\
  \ we need a person who stays at the base camp of Vibo Valentia, near the barracks\
  \ for at least two weeks, to perform daily tasks related to the needs of the crew,\
  \ while we are filming, following them with an embedded crew\u201D.\nI was incredulous.\n\
  After a second telephone appointment, in which Barbara confirmed the arrangements\
  \ for collaboration, in a hot July afternoon I arrived in Vibo Valentia, in the\
  \ lovely residence where the crew was staying. It was hot, I was very curious, and\
  \ a little excited. This girl with green eyes opened the door.\nOn the balcony,\
  \ while we were smoking a cigarette, he explained to me the details and the problems\
  \ of the project.\nFrom the beginning there was a different job from the usual,\
  \ every day we had to organize the work, without knowing what we would do the next\
  \ day. A jump in the dark.\nThe first approach to the military world, totally unknown\
  \ to me, took place on the following summer morning, when I entered for the first\
  \ in my life in a military barracks. I crossed the entrance gate and the barbed\
  \ wire, fascinated by the time I passed the sign \"military zone, limit impassable-no\
  \ unauthorized access\".\nI had never had contact with that environment, not a relative\
  \ Carabiniere and not even a mobster, as one of them had asked me jokingly.\nThe\
  \ barracks are very large, home to the 14th Calabria Battalion, there are wide roads\
  \ where the boys train jogging. Some live there. A large area is dedicated to the\
  \ helicopter core, complete with hangars and take-off/landing for the vehicles available.\
  \ Then there is the shooting range, the canteen and a small vegetable garden with\
  \ various herbs.\n The boys of the base of operations, in t-shirt and camouflage\
  \ pants, have shown themselves immediately welcoming and collaborative.\nIn the\
  \ following five weeks, we lived between the barracks, the Aspromonte Forest and\
  \ the long car rides at night.\nIn the early days I will have known at least a hundred\
  \ people among the Hunters Squadron, officers, helicopters, and from the beginning\
  \ I found it hard to understand the hierarchical ranks. Although I understand that\
  \ most of them are all Brigadier or Deputy Sargent. Then there are the lieutenants,\
  \ the Colonel and the elders. To date, for me it remains a mystery to identify them\
  \ only by their ranks. Based on the daily availability we were assigned the team\
  \ to support, the means of transportation (Ducato, Land Rover, Isuzu) and what operations\
  \ to resume.\nThe Hunters were almost always in camouflage, with various straps\
  \ and zip on their sleeves, called patches, which distinguished their department\
  \ and rank. You will think that they are obvious knowledgeable, but for me they\
  \ were not at all. The patches for them are a source of pride, so much so that even\
  \ our colleagues were competing to have someone, instead in my eyes were unknown\
  \ symbols, even if I understood that they indicated their value.\nThis is how my\
  \ adventure began: two girls catapulted into a barracks with four hundred Carabinieri,\
  \ in a totally male environment, surrounded by vigorous, handsome men and a halo\
  \ of mystery and secrecy.\nSo, here I am, I was at the beach the week before playing\
  \ with children, and the next one I was catapulted in the Aspromonte Forest, without\
  \ any training, with the special department of the Calabria Hunters Squadron who\
  \ arrest the fugitives."
