Text: "Alexandria Egypt has a very impressive and storied past,  Alexandria is the\
  \ second largest city in Egypt. The city has definitely lost some of the grandeur\
  \ of its past . However, with a bit of searching travelers can still find bits of\
  \ Alexandria\u2019s glorious past.\n\nThese includeGreco-Roman monuments, beautiful\
  \ gardens, the Qaitbay Citadel, palaces, Old caf\xE9s, the Opera House, and even\
  \ sunken treasure. Visitors can also seek knowledge at several museums, explore\
  \ the modern Bibliotheca Alexandrina, relax at one of the city\u2019s many beaches,\
  \ and visit several important religious sites.\n\nMany people visit Alexandria as\
  \ a cruise stop or as a day trip from Cairo (as we did), but it can also be a great\
  \ place to base for a few days. We share practical tips on getting to and getting\
  \ around Alexandria, top things to do in Alexandria, and how to put together your\
  \ own perfect itinerary for Alexandria Egypt.\nWithin Alexandria, there are a number\
  \ of public transit options, including the tram network, the commuter rail, and\
  \ public buses. There are also the  microbuses, but since Alexandria has a public\
  \ bus system, you don\u2019t need to rely on these as they can be difficult to figure\
  \ out. Here is a decent breakdown of transportation options within Egypt , although\
  \ concrete information is difficult to provide and hard to attain.\n\nSchedules\
  \ can be difficult to find so check at bus and tram stops, or ask at a hotel for\
  \ assistance. Having the names of places you want to go written down in Arabic as\
  \ well as English can make it easier for locals to point you in the right direction.\
  \ Note that numbers are often written in Arabic so having a table of Arabic number\
  \ with you is a very smart idea.\n\nTaxis are also abundant although best to ask\
  \ hotel staff or a local for normal fare prices and be very clear upfront in negotiating\
  \ fares with drivers. There are a number of things to do in Alexandria Egypt, and\
  \ it is really going to depend on your interests (e.g., shopping, diving, Roman\
  \ history, kid-friendly, jewelry) and I would build an itinerary based on what you\
  \ most enjoy from the list of highlights. But if I were giving a someone a very\
  \ general itinerary for a day trip or one full day in Alexandria,I have long wanted\
  \ to visit Alexandria; my desire heavily bolstered by the epic film Cleopatra starring\
  \ Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Alexandria Egypt was the setting for so many\
  \ historic events, dramatic stories, and great architectural feats. However, Alexandria\
  \ is no longer the cosmopolitan cultural hub it once was and is now home to high-rise\
  \ concrete apartment blocks, modern hotels, and traffic-filled streets.\n\nBut with\
  \ some patience, you can still find evidence of the ancient pharaohs, the Greeks,\
  \ the Romans, the royals, and the early twentieth century intellectuals sitting\
  \ alongside apartment complexes and office buildings. There are plenty of things\
  \ to do in Alexandria Egypt that will fit a range of interests and budgets In terms\
  \ of cuisine, Alexandria offers many of the same options you\u2019ll find throughout\
  \ Egypt but is best known for its seafood. There are many seafood restaurants with\
  \ views located within walking distance of the Citadel of Qaitbay and eastern habor,\
  \ such as the popular White and Blue Restaurant (also known as the Greek Club, 5\
  \ minutes from citadel) located on the top floor above the Greek Nautical Club of\
  \ Alexandria. Another popular nearby restaurant with a view (although a bit pricey)\
  \ is the Fish Market (15 minute walk from citadel). There are numerous beaches within\
  \ Alexandria and in surrounding towns. Many are private beaches owned by hotels\
  \ and resorts (although many you can still pay to access as non-guests) and some\
  \ are public beaches (an entry fee is charged at many although a few are free).\
  \ Some of the most popular beaches are the Maamoura Beach, Stanley Beach, and the\
  \ beaches near the Montaza Palace.\n\nBeaches, especially the public ones, can get\
  \ very crowded in the summer and the level of cleanliness of the beaches (and the\
  \ water) seems to vary. At many beaches, the entrance fee includes use of beach\
  \ chairs, umbrellas, dressing rooms, toilets, etc.\nwish to travel too."
