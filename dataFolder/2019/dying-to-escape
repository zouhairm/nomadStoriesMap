Text: "I'm a passionate coach driven in exploring the best aesthetic of haircare and\
  \ proudly working with global beauty brand Loreal. \n\nAugust,2018 we escaped to\
  \ 'forward Russia' wherein we were absorbed with visual cultural past of literature,\
  \ painting, cinema and infuential arts. \n\nWe walked by Kremlin and mesmerized\
  \ to see the historical White House. Marvel at historic Red Square, and see the\
  \ facades of the Lenin Mausoleum, the History Museum, and St. Basil\u2019s Cathedral.\n\
  \nMoscow Street Food is diverse and multi-cultural, reflecting the vast expanse\
  \ of land in Russia stretching from Europe to Asia. The harsh climate of Russia\
  \ gave rise to simple, but often hearty food, made using whatever ingredients were\
  \ in season. It also gave rise to foods that could be kept for long periods of time\
  \ through salting, pickling, preserving, freezing or smoking. As the economic and\
  \ cultural center of Russia, the city of Moscow has a vast array of traditional\
  \ street food.\n\nMost of Russia has extremely cold temperatures during the winter.\
  \ Due to this, many parts of the country are sparsely populated.\n\nRussia, the\
  \ land of fabulous shoes never failed to amaze me the fact they walked the cobbled\
  \ streets In 6-inch stilettoes, never faltering. Perhaps all the vodka numbs the\
  \ feet.... :) \nThey are SO stylish! Definitely the most stylish Europeans I\u2019\
  ve ever seen. It really is like walking down the street with a bunch of super models.\n\
  \nWe really did enjoy our time there! Russia is subjective and it was like we had\
  \ an entirely different trip than some others in our group, who didn\u2019t quite\
  \ come away with the same feelings we did. It\u2019s just such a different mindset\
  \ there and you really have to be open to it.\n\nI did not expect Moscow to be as\
  \ I have seen. I thought it would be gray, gloomy place with a lot of culture. Even\
  \ if I was not able to see the opera or a ballet at Bolshoi theatre like I wished,\
  \ I was so satisfied just going around the city on my first visit to Russia. 4 days\
  \ and three nights in this city is definitely not enough.\n\nWith a heavy heart,\
  \ I left Moscow. I have posted again and again how much I love the city, its people,\
  \ and the food. I hope to come back again!! \n\nTaking only memories!! \nXoxo"
