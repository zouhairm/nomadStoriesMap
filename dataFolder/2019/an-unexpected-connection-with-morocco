Text: "According to an anonymous poem I discovered on the wall of a carpet shop in\
  \ Marrakech \u2018Moroccan rugs are a poem, a poem that is never the same that the\
  \ mind and the hands play with, but that no machine can conceive\u2019.  And in\
  \ Morocco I must confess that like the designs on the carpets every adventure with\
  \ every trip was different with new discoveries to be made.  Never the same pattern\
  \ was used.\nMy love affair with Morocco developed over the years, with a mad passion\
  \ which engulfed me to only want to experience more of its beguiling mystic.  My\
  \ first adventure, a few years ago, into the unknown Morocco was only accompanied\
  \ by a backpack (with minimum clothing!), a highlighted guidebook with no pre-booked\
  \ accommodation, as well as a crazed hunger for adventure and hardly any understanding\
  \ of French, Spanish or Arabic!  Maybe the idea of travelling to Morocco was a fit\
  \ of madness, as one does to a foreign, unknown destination where you can\u2019\
  t speak the language and have virtually nothing in common with the locals, except\
  \ the pull of the unknown and unexpected.\nBut the memories of the day-to-day rhythms,\
  \ the hospitable people, kaleidoscope of colours and overbearing smell of pyramid\
  \ formed spices filling my nostrils became a vivid memory after each return; and\
  \ the reality of my adventure only dawned on me with the viewing of my photographs\
  \ and the Sahara sand falling out of my diary.  As the scents of Morocco blows South\
  \ over the African continent once again, reaching my senses with vivid recognition\
  \ and a feeling of mystic. The way the palette in the souks \u2013 purple, green,\
  \ red, orange \u2013 is so strong, so intense that the stalls together resemble\
  \ a Gauguin still life in your memory.\nEarly in the morning, after you have broken\
  \ a piece of the warm baked bread, you need to wash it down with a glass of freshly\
  \ squeezed orange juice.  In the morning the light filters onto the Djemaa el Fna,\
  \ as the square is cleaned.  Men unlurched from the hiding places in their orange\
  \ juice carts.  Ripe vermicillon oranges are displayed like rising suns in the morning.\
  \  And before your eyes a glass of orange juice magically appears on the cart\u2019\
  s counter.  You first take a small sip, then you let the golden liquid run down\
  \ your throat and then savour the golden moment.  You literally drink in the morning\
  \ air.  And you know that another bright morning in Marrakech has arrived!  \nYou\
  \ put your glass back and he fills it half full again from a jug. \u201CFor you,\
  \ Madame.  Welcome.  Welcome to Morocco!\u201D  And even though he does this for\
  \ everyone, you will surely return to him tomorrow and the next day \u2026 and maybe\
  \ already this afternoon.  Because you have made a new friend in Morocco\u2026\n\
  Moroccan hospitality is widely known, as a stranger will become a visitor and welcomed\
  \ into the Moroccan home to be given food or refreshment.  The hospitality of Morocco\
  \ can be summed up in an Arabic proverb: \u2018I salute you with a box filled with\
  \ sesame seeds.  Each seed represents one hundred greetings.\u2019 In Morocco any\
  \ visitor can be assured to receive many sesame seeds, as Moroccans believe that\
  \ food for one is enough for two, and food for two is enough for three.  Despite\
  \ the financial situation of the family, any food and drink available will be shared\
  \ in abundance with the guests and newly found friends.  On my train journey from\
  \ Casablanca to Marrakech I met an old lady with hardly any knowledge of English\
  \ but who was so adamant about having me as her guest at her house in Rabat that\
  \ the help of a willing translator was called in to translate the invitation to\
  \ me.  She wanted me to return with her the next day to Rabat to join in her hospitality.\
  \  But after many persuasions she accepted that I could not return with her on this\
  \ journey. Instead she reluctantly bought me mint tea on the train instead, out\
  \ of her restricted funds. I had made a local connection, without even communicating\
  \ the same spoken language. Only the language of a fellow traveller."
