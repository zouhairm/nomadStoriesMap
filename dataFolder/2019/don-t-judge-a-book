Text: "The trip had started with an overnight stay in Port Moresby. \n\nThe accommodation\
  \ was one of the up market hotels, the difference to else where I had stayed while\
  \ travelling was they had Razor wire around the compound and armed guards patrolling\
  \ the grounds of a night time. \n\nThe dive trip group leader knew an expat living\
  \ and working in Port Moresby so it was decided to go down the Royal Papua Yacht\
  \ Club for dinner. A bus was organised by the hotel and we were bused down, with\
  \ an extra passenger. A security card with a shotgun resting between his knees.\
  \ Dinner was good even with tails from the Expat about living in a compound with\
  \ razor wire and a firearm beside his bed and steel gates or doors in the hall way\
  \ to secure the bedrooms in case of a home invasion. \n\nThe next morning we departed\
  \ and arrived in Kavieng for a liveaboard dive trip.  The dive trip was great. \
  \ From hammerhead sharks, to pygmy seahorses, to large schooling fish. PNG is a\
  \ great place to dive and will be back.\n\nDuring the trip I shared a room with\
  \ a mate Mark, who while appearing the successful corporate executive gym junkie\
  \ pretty boy, he actually grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in Wales as a\
  \ lad many years ago.  \n\nWe get to the end of the trip arrive back at Kavieng\
  \ for a couple of days before the flight back home.\n\nFirst night back on land\
  \ in Kavieng we all as a group head to the local hotel for dinner and a few drinks.\
  \ The Hotel is a few blocks from where we are staying so a short walk up for the\
  \ group. After dinner, Mark decides on a game of pool, so just the two off us wander\
  \ to the front bar for a drink and game. \n\nA couple of locals are have the table\
  \ and Mark and I end up playing doubles against the locals. \n\nAll going well until\
  \ the dive group wander past the front bar and let us know they are all heading\
  \ back and we should head back with them. \nAfter a few quiet words from the trip\
  \ leader about how he thinks we should head back as a group, but Mark and I are\
  \ happy to finish the game and head back when we are ready, in the end the two of\
  \ stay.\n\nA few more games with a few more locals, a couple of rounds of drinks\
  \ and a few laughs were had and a few hours later we walk back to where we are staying.\
  \ \n\nWe arrive back and find the trip leader sitting by the pool waiting for us\
  \ to get back where he decides to tell us how we should have come back when he \u201C\
  told us\u201D and it was not safe etc. Mark and I decide to just walk past him and\
  \ back to the room to hit the sack.  \n\nWhile I knew Mark could look after himself\
  \ if push came to shove, I have always been excellent at reading a situation, something\
  \ from a young age the ability to read what is going on around you and in most cases\
  \ being about to avoid confrontation or trouble. At no stage did I have a worry\
  \ in the world while in that front bar playing pool and having some laughs with\
  \ the locals. \n\nWe spent another two days in Kavieng and everywhere we wandered\
  \ we ran into our newfound local friends or relatives of our new friends. \nAlways\
  \ with a hello, a smile and wave.  In the local shop or out walking along the waterfront\
  \ or wandering the streets.  \n\nI still remember sitting overlooking the water\
  \ talking to one of those locals we had met in the bar about how he was growing\
  \ vanilla beans and about his life and his family.\n\nMy trip to PNG and what I\
  \ brought back, was not just the images of the Pygmy seahorses, but also the memories\
  \ of listening to dreams and hopes of a man from Kavieng.\n\nAll I can say is don\u2019\
  t judge a country or race by one place or experience."
