Text: "Summer 2016 was around the corner and the nagging to go on an adventure got\
  \ louder. \u2018I can\u2019t go back to that retail job,\u2019 my mind wandered\
  \ as my professor\u2019s distant voice suddenly came to a halt. The chair screeches\
  \ across the gray tile and shuffling of book bags signaled that class was over.\
  \ \n\n\u201CProfessor, I\u2019d love to hear more about that South Korea trip you\u2019\
  re leading this summer,\u201D I said nervously to the slump frame standing in front\
  \ of the room. \u201CYou should apply, there\u2019s still space,\u201D he told me.\
  \ \u201CReally?\u201D trying very little to hold back the smirk forming across my\
  \ chubby face.\n\nWith the deadline two weeks away, each step at this point was\
  \ crucial. It meant calling my parents who thankfully were immediately on board\
  \ and abruptly leaving classes to frantically dash across campus to offices that\
  \ were the glue to the application process.\n\nNow it was July \u2013 two months\
  \ later \u2013 and time to embark on a journey to East Asia, a continent I had never\
  \ traveled to before or had really given much thought to traveling to. I arrived\
  \ at the airport just shy of 11:30 a.m. and knew only one familiar face \u2013 my\
  \ balding professor who eagerly encouraged me to apply. Around him were three classmates\
  \ that I did not know, but whom I would soon become close friends with even long\
  \ after our three-week trip ended.\n\nAs 11:45 p.m. came around, the group expanded.\
  \ Now joining myself and the girls with shoulder-length hair, was a tall girl with\
  \ black twisted hair, a tall wonky fellow, a guy with spiky hair and another with\
  \ round glasses. We huddled around in the boarding area after checking in, each\
  \ face with a look of pure animation we could not contain. We may have all been\
  \ strangers then, but we were all instantly connected by a childlike enthusiasm\
  \ for what awaited us in South Korea.\n\nThe number on the small black screen in\
  \ front of me blinked the number 10 \u2013 referring to the number of hours left\
  \ before we landed. The four hours we had already spent on the flight, began to\
  \ make us restless but nevertheless wide-eyed with eager and anticipation. \u201C\
  Am I really doing this?\u201D I pondered to myself at every hourly interval, somewhat\
  \ trying to keep my mind distracted from the unknown.\n\nThe small black screen\
  \ now blinked 30 minutes, and now my mind and heart raced like a headless chicken.\
  \ Was I scared or just overly excited? I guess the uncontrollable wide grin present\
  \ on my face best answers that.\n\nThe flight landed and the congratulatory \u2018\
  Thank you God\u2019 applauses commenced. We soon regained blood flow through our\
  \ legs as we shuffled off the plane, into a shiny black tiled airport with bathrooms\
  \ that seemed fitting for a hotel.\n\nWe continued to shuffle through the airport\
  \ and unto customs, waiting on lines that proved my group and I weren\u2019t the\
  \ only foreigners. Soon I was next in line and ecstatic to get to the other side,\
  \ but as the customs officer stamped my passport in a manner that showed me that\
  \ this was just another regular day for him, I stood in awe of being on foreign\
  \ soil. \n\nFrom customs to baggage claim we lugged our bodies, unaware of the jet\
  \ lag that was creeping in. We finally headed outside of the airport towards a bus\
  \ that came to rescue our tired bodies and zip us off to Dongguk University where\
  \ we would call home for the next three weeks. I took a long breath in before boarding\
  \ the bus \u2013 inquisitive to smell the Korean air, but only to catch a whiff\
  \ of second-hand smoke. My noses and eyebrows raised instantly identifying it with\
  \ that of New York City.\n\nWe boarded the bus and off we drove, heading down winding\
  \ roads on a wishbone resembling highway. My grin was now wider than it ever had\
  \ been as my mind ran laps excited for what was to come. And as I peered through\
  \ the bus window while the sun began to set in the horizon, I was glad I took a\
  \ leap into the unknown."
