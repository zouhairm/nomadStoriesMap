Text: "In 2009 I travel to Bras\xEDlia (the capital of Brazil) for the first time\
  \ with my parents. I just fell in love for that place, their culture, architecture\
  \ and people. We spend 15 days there and we visit the National Congress (where our\
  \ Politicians works), the Cathedral of Bras\xEDlia (where has an beautiful stained-glass),\
  \ the three powers plaza (this plaza received this name because is where It\xB4\
  s located the Supreme Court, the National Congress and the Planalto Palace), Dom\
  \ Bosco Church (where has and enormous chandelier), the City Park Dona Sarah Kubitschek\
  \ (which is the second largest park in Brazil and has this name in memory of the\
  \ spouse of the president fouder of the city) and the Digital TV Tower (we can go\
  \ upstairs and have the view of the whole city). I had an unbelievable connection\
  \ with the city (I truly felt that I was part of that city).\n          In 2012\
  \ I had the opportunity to come back to Bras\xEDlia again for a 20 day travel and\
  \ this time I had visited new tourists attractions I hadn\xB4t visited 3 years before:\
  \ the JK Bridge (it has this name in memory of the founder of the city), the Pont\xE3\
  o (where you will find an amazing view of the Parano\xE1 Lake, nice restaurants\
  \ and you can even go on to a boat ride), the Botanical Garden (you feel so relaxed\
  \ there) , the National Museum (the shape and the outside reminds us a flying saucer)\
  \ and the Po\xE7o Azul Waterfall (it has cristal clear water there). \n        \
  \  This time I spent in Bras\xEDlia was so good that I decided to live there one\
  \ day. I didn\xB4t know how and when I would go there. \nIn 2014, I was graduating\
  \ for high school and I decided that I needed a big change in my life. My Graduation\
  \ Ceremony was in December 19, this day I realize that I had to chase my dream,\
  \ so I decided to move to Bras\xEDlia to go to the college. In December 21, I moved\
  \ on. My parents said that I was crazy because we didn\xB4t know anyone who lives\
  \ there but they respected my decision. I did not regreat for that! Bras\xEDlia\
  \ gave me incredible opportunities: I\xB4m almost graduating in law school, I\xB4\
  m doing a second degree in Business and I also a President of a non profit organisation.\
  \ \n          People are always asking me why I decided to leave Jo\xE3o Pessoa\
  \ (the city my family lives) and I say that we need to change our lives and face\
  \ new challenges. Now a days, It\xB4s been 4 years and a month there I live here\
  \ and I don\xB4t pretend to leave this place soon. My friends became family members\
  \ to me and they are always supportting me but I have to confess that I miss my\
  \ family. Fortunately, my mum save some money and in December she and my sister\
  \ came to visit me. It was awesome! Apart missing my family, I love this place.\
  \ There\xB4s a lot of things to do (even if you are broke, there\xB4s a lot of events\
  \ for free). The Governor gives to Students a free pass for using in the bus or\
  \ in the subway so we don\xB4t spend money with transportation.\n          Hope\
  \ you had liked my life story and see you soon!"
