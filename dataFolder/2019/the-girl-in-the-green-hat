Text: "I was in the shopping district in Vienna. Beautiful clothes, designer purses,\
  \ shoes, and an iced, ten-euro, apple-centric pastry\u2026that\u2019s what I expected\
  \ to find. Not fine art, the kind I studied in university. Not Picasso and Monet,\
  \ my two all-time favorites, with Van Gogh sitting in third, and Renoir in fourth.\
  \ My heart soared. Culture! \n\nWhen you sign up for a two-week tour around Eastern\
  \ Europe, it\u2019s culture you\u2019re looking for more than anything. You\u2019\
  re travelling to the part of the world that produced Mozart and Handel, that cultivated\
  \ geniuses like Marie Curie, and gave existence to history buffs like me, because\
  \ my grandfather's family came from Poland. I give credit to my Canadian city. It\
  \ tries its best. There\u2019s an art centre (just one) and a theatre (again, just\
  \ one) downtown, but I\u2019m greedy. I want to devour culture, not sample it. I\
  \ also inherited an adventurous side from my travel bug-bitten parents, and being\
  \ abroad on my own for the first time at age twenty-six offered opportunities for\
  \ my own little side adventures, outside of the rigid tour curriculum to cathedrals\
  \ and city halls. Naturally, I wanted to go to museums. \n\nVienna\u2019s touristy\
  \ shopping sector unexpectedly presented a feast for art-freak gluttony in the form\
  \ of The Albertina Museum, which I\u2019d spotted from the bus the day before but\
  \ didn\u2019t think I would have the chance to visit. Being (admittedly) directionally\
  \ challenged, I did not pin any hope on being able to find it on my own. But I did!\
  \ Sort of. Accidentally. From the corner of my eye while exiting the fanciest H&M\
  \ I'd ever bought black leggings from. It still counts. \n\nWhen I saw the museum,\
  \ I booked it. I only had two hours before I had to be back on the tour bus. The\
  \ building looked like a villa from a period drama movie set, where I imagine the\
  \ spirited young lady in a gorgeous costume would banter with her equally gorgeous\
  \ love interest. It was tall, creamy white, marble, and imposing, but I wasn\u2019\
  t daunted. I practically skipped up the stairs and felt nothing about handing over\
  \ twenty euros of my precious travel cash for a ticket inside. \n\nI was wearing\
  \ the pale green sunhat with a wide, protective rim that I\u2019d bought in desperation\
  \ in scorching hot Italy while on a family vacation years earlier. Who would have\
  \ guessed that, while delightedly browsing the masterpieces, I would find myself\
  \ standing next to Picasso\u2019s The Girl in the Green Hat, on that day, wearing\
  \ that hat? Certainly not me. Not my clumsy and disoriented self when I was hurrying\
  \ to get dressed in my hotel room that morning at six. I imagine Picasso put much\
  \ more thought into dressing his lady, just as Da Vinci had scrupulously painted\
  \ the folds on the gown of The Lady of the Ermine, another portrait I had gone out\
  \ of my way to see, back in Krakow earlier on the tour. \n\nNow, in Vienna, I asked\
  \ a high schooler wandering around with his class to quickly snap my picture with\
  \ my phone, crossing my fingers that he knew enough schoolroom English to understand\
  \ my request. He did. A girl in a green hat posed next to The Girl in the Green\
  \ Hat and smiled proudly while her canvas counterpart stared out ahead, her scribble\
  \ of a mouth slightly sardonic, her mismatched Picasso eyes just as amused by the\
  \ coincidence. \n\nI remember when I saw the Mona Lisa with my Mom at the Louvre\
  \ in France years back, I barely got near her, so air-tight was the crowd of tourists\
  \ packed around her, but my chance encounter with another equally as glamorous painted\
  \ lady\u2014whose fashion sense matched mine a lot better\u2014more than compensated.\
  \ I didn't expect to find the Girl in the Green Hat and she certainly didn't prepare\
  \ herself for me either. I imagine that if my Mom had been there with me that day,\
  \ she would have joked that the two of us should have called each other in advance,\
  \ to make sure we didn't wear the same thing. \n\n\"But Mom, listen, we both shop\
  \ in Vienna!\" I would have joked right back."
