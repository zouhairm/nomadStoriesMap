Text: "I was stuck in a over crowded sleeper class in train one day when a girl came\
  \ in front of my berth. As I saw this little girl is doing some stunts for the entertainment\_\
  of passengers to earn money. Although the stunts seems to be painful but the huge\
  \ self respect of this little girl hold her to beg. .\n\nI was bewildered by her\
  \ act and can't stop to ask her name, She shyly but firmly said 'PINKI' Though she\
  \ was begging money,\_ but she refused to call it beg, She said she was earning\
  \ it by doing work, whatever she can do is upto her limit. I am privileged person\
  \ from childhood, I'd never faced this kind of situations, but I can proudly say,\
  \ this then I have never seen this kind of courage too. .\n\nDon't know she is forced\_\
  or by will in this kind of profession which has no future whatever it is but the\
  \ most important thing I have noticed was her innocence and her attitude towards\
  \ life. .\n\nDespite of her profession She was perfectly dressed, neatly\_combed\_\
  \_and In makeup what so ever She can afford. She was showing the world that no matter\
  \ what She will stand up\_against all odds, no matter what She\_will fight for her\
  \ pride. Suddenly I had a urge to photograph her and without even blinking eyes\
  \ drawing shyness on seats, She curiously gazed at lens with courage and I clicked\
  \ her with feeling of joy,satisfaction and lifetime lesson that \"Don't learn from\
  \ what\_you can see,see those from whom you can learn.\""
