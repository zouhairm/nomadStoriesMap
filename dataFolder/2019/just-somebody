Text: "JUST SOMEBODY\n    I could have been anyone at some other place and time. Well,\
  \ I became \u201Cme\u201D. It is August, the wind is whistling in a very low pitch.\
  \ Here I am at the bus station in Urla, located in the province of \u0130zmir, in\
  \ Turkey, waiting for the host of the farm I am going to visit. Sitting on my suitcase,\
  \ my elbows settled on my knees, and my eyes closed... \n    I feel a shadow in\
  \ front of me. The figure coughs as if he gets prepared to give a speech. It is\
  \ something you do to gain some time before you get ready to speak, right? Finally,\
  \ I hear him saying my name: Ece. I open my eyes and see a long man with strong\
  \ hands, curvy eyes and sweat droplets on his forehead. He mops his brow with his\
  \ handkerchief, patterned with flowers on the right corner before he starts to talk\
  \ again. He makes sure that his hands are part of the conversation, pointing at\
  \ different directions and describing me Urla briefly. He talks really fast. I miss\
  \ most of his words, I miss the meaning. Anyway, I just nod and smile. His last\
  \ gesture is to direct me to follow him to his little van. \u201CIt is half an hour\
  \ drive to our farm\u201D, he says, walking in hasty steps, without turning his\
  \ face to me. I do something between running and walking to catch up with his pace.\n\
  \        We get in the van. His hands are settled on the wheel confidently. The\
  \ soil under his fingernails catches my attention. These hands should have been\
  \ working since the morning. After exchanging a few words, on the right side of\
  \ the road, I see someone waving at us. We stop to pick up the villager, Brother\
  \ Mustafa. I learn that he has been living here since his birth. The host, Ali Bey,\
  \ tells about his first time in Urla in a rather trembling voice. He talks as if\
  \ he is living those moments one more time: \n-\t\u201CNature tests you first until\
  \ she makes sure if you are patient and strong enough.  When nature is satisfied\
  \ and convinced that you deserve what she gives, then finally you see plants growing.\
  \ Hard work pays off eventually. Still, at those times, if it weren\u2019t the villagers\
  \ with their generous heart, I wouldn\u2019t be able to hang on. Brother Mustafa\
  \ is one of them.\u201D \n   There is so much beneath those words apparently, so\
  \ many stories of failure, disillusionment, sharing and finally success.  From the\
  \ silence, I understand that it is my turn to talk. I can guess the question without\
  \ being asked: Why do I decide to be on the roads? Considering it as a multiple-choice\
  \ question, here are the possible answers: a) Looking for some adventure, b) learning\
  \ about nature, and c) finding who you are. Which one is mine? To be honest, I am\
  \ not on the roads to find an answer but rather a good question, which has never\
  \ been asked. \n       From the rear- view window, I check Brother Mustafa, who\
  \ has just dozed off at the back seat. His head falls to the left side, unable to\
  \ carry itself while asleep. There is gravel path ahead of us now, we almost jump\
  \ up and down on our seats as our heads accord with the rhythm of the van. We can\u2019\
  t help but laugh. After such special tiny moments, memories always come back to\
  \ me. I remember my grandma telling me once, \u201CMy dear, do not fully explore\
  \ anywhere, leave something behind, a friend to revisit, a mountain to climb, an\
  \ ancient path to walk, anything which will make you go there again one day\u201D\
  .  Since then, wherever I go, these words are my shadow. I wonder what I am going\
  \ to find here to make me want to come back. As I am drawn into my dream world,\
  \ Ali Bey\u2019s hands start to make some music on the wheel."
