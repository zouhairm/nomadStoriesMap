Text: "The Temple glistened flawlessly against the reflecting pool at night, every\
  \ detail of the intricate architecture mirrored in the still waters that fully embraced\
  \ it. Aside from the buzzing of whispers amongst groups like ours, the vicinity\
  \ was almost entirely silent. We followed the red carpet that wrapped around the\
  \ periphery of the pool to protect our bare feet from the freezing marble floors.\
  \ \u201CGood thinking,\u201D I bemused to my mother and aunt, pointing towards the\
  \ carpet. They nodded in agreement. Indian temples aren\u2019t usually known for\
  \ being particularly accommodating, so this was a pleasant change.\n\nThe quiet\
  \ was a necessary contrast to the chaos we had just withstood. You see, before Amritsar,\
  \ we had been in Haridwar, where we spread my grandmother\u2019s ashes in the Ganga\
  \ River. She had passed away six years prior, and like many Hindus, this was one\
  \ of her final wishes. There\u2019s a widely held belief in Hinduism that one can\
  \ achieve salvation in the afterlife if their ashes are dispersed in the Ganga.\
  \ \n\nMy grandmother was a strong woman, but even she was unable to escape the burdens\
  \ of being born a girl into a lower class home. Like many women in India, her life\
  \ had hardly been her own, and maybe for that reason, we were determined to give\
  \ her the one thing she wanted in death. If poverty and pain are generational, so\
  \ is power. And we were putting ours to use. \n\nHaridwar was a difficult place\
  \ to go, both geographically and emotionally. While the river and mountains make\
  \ for spectacular views, cautiously hidden within them is a religious fanaticism\
  \ that can become stifling. People arrive everyday in their most vulnerable conditions,\
  \ desperately seeking hope and atonement, and next to them you will find holy men\
  \ performing prayers and rituals in Sanskrit. Some are legitimate, most are not.\
  \ It is nearly impossible to distinguish the two. \n\nIt was starting to get dark,\
  \ and since the evening prayers had just concluded, the riverbank was bustling.\
  \ Darkness equated to more risk, so we accepted the first priest who approached\
  \ us. My aunt followed him to the edge of the riverbank down the rocky stairs while\
  \ my mother and I watched as he began chanting with my aunt repeating after him.\
  \ I was my mother\u2019s daughter, and she and my aunt were my grandmother\u2019\
  s daughters--all of us stubborn and resolute. How else could we explain this unlikely\
  \ moment where we, three generations of women, were united for the last time to\
  \ bid farewell to my grandmother in the way she, herself, envisioned?\n\nAs we watched\
  \ her ashes merge into the mineralized water and flow away from us, the priest\u2019\
  s voice abruptly broke our concentration with his clamoring for payment. As expected,\
  \ he was going to cheat us, and we knowingly went along with it. \n\n***\n\nWe were\
  \ almost done touring the Golden Temple when we suddenly saw a crowd gather. They\
  \ were surrounding a large book and singing hymns while the priests carried it away\
  \ on an ornate palanquin. Everyone around us was watching as if they just witnessed\
  \ God with their own eyes. The entire ceremony lasted only a few moments, but it\
  \ left everyone entranced.\nOnce the crowd cleared, we began to make our way out\
  \ of the Temple grounds. We made the occasional stop to look at traditional Punjabi\
  \ accessories in the shops, trying on shawls and bangles, as we headed back to the\
  \ car.\n\nOnce we settled into the backseat, I started describing what we had witnessed\
  \ to our driver, Manpreet. He turned his head, and his eyes were lit up.\n\n\u201C\
  What you saw was Sukhasan,\u201D speaking in a hybrid of Hindi and Punjabi.\n\n\
  I still wasn\u2019t following. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s Sukhasan?\u201D I asked. \n\
  \n\u201CSukhasan occurs every night, where the priests take the Guru Granth Sahib,\
  \ the holy book of Sikhism, out of the Temple to rest. And every morning, they bring\
  \ it back. Everyday, thousands of people wait all night to witness Sukhasan. They\
  \ say only the fortunate get to see it. You are very lucky,\u201D he said with a\
  \ smile before he turned on the car and began driving. \n\nHe was right. We were\
  \ very lucky."
