Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to discover myself in the Albuquerque desert. In all the\
  \ twenty-four years of my life, nothing felt as much a part of me as what I found\
  \ there. It flirted with my soul in tufts of sand, sticking between my toes, on\
  \ my brow, and in my heart. My feet had taken me few places at that point, stained\
  \ solely by the red clay of central Mississippi and washed clean by the nearest\
  \ beaches and mountain streams. They were fond of those places, sure, but my Mississippi-stained\
  \ feet found something of themselves in the desert of New Mexico. \n\nI, my English\
  \ Literature professor, and two classmates had driven the better part of two days\
  \ to attend a national English conference. On this particular day, blue skies stretching\
  \ as far as one could see, we decided to get out of the city. As we took the winding\
  \ road to Petroglyph National Park, the busyness of convention activities evaporated.\
  \ Mountain scenes replaced our busy schedules, dry heat distracted us from the tension\
  \ of travel, and sparse clouds carried away our to-do's.\n\nAs the three black-topped\
  \ sister volcanoes grew larger through the windshield, anticipation unfastened our\
  \ seatbelts and pulled us forward. \u201CCloser, closer!\u201D they seemed to call.\
  \ I sat with my forehead pressed against the window, hot but not steaming as it\
  \ would in Mississippi, as I tried to make sense of what lay before me. A scene\
  \ vastly different from the snug landscapes of home. The Sandia mountains stretched\
  \ along one side with nothing but Earth and sky on the other. Something about it\
  \ called to me, that place between the Earth and sky. I had only ever seen the ocean\
  \ kiss the heavens in that way, and it sparked something within me. Woke something\
  \ deep inside.\n\nApproaching the volcanoes reminded me of church -- finding my\
  \ seat carefully, hyperaware of each step, and sitting close enough to listen. To\
  \ get the message. But this time I was able to approach in a way that felt natural\
  \ to me: barefoot. Barefoot like so many times before, yet different. I felt her\
  \ beneath me. I felt her rise up into me. And as we ascended from sand to rock,\
  \ I had the sense that whatever made this place also made me. I was silent. In awe.\
  \ Gasping. Inhaling. Getting as much of the heat, energy, scenery, and spirit that\
  \ I could. I ran my fingers across the knotted stones, admired the rainbow hues\
  \ of lichen on their skins, and embraced them like the sisters and brothers I never\
  \ had. \n\nWe stayed there for what seems like hours now, gazing out at the surrounding\
  \ Sandia mountains as they turned red from the setting sun -- red like my Mississippi\
  \ feet. I walked backwards as we descended the black peaks, simultaneously filled\
  \ with too much joy and pain at having found something buried deep within me there\
  \ and knowing I had to leave it. They pulled at my heart as I retreated, and I could\
  \ swear that my ribs would burst open the further I walked. I found myself again\
  \ sitting in the car with my peers, looking over curiously at the clean streaks\
  \ on my face but graciously allowing me the silence to process. To feel. To say\
  \ goodbye. \n\nI sit here three years later still feeling that pull beneath my ribs.\
  \ A book sits at my side, \u201CWomen Who Run With the Wolves,\u201D and I\u2019\
  m sure that what I found in that desert is what the author refers to as the \u201C\
  wild woman archetype,\u201D the feminine spirit that inhabits each and every one\
  \ of us. The spirit that we have so long pushed down, down into the dirt, abandoning\
  \ her for more \u201Cproper\u201D ways. The one we\u2019ve chosen to forget, even\
  \ when she threatens to pull herself out. I\u2019ve come to learn that she finds\
  \ us in various ways -- through music, dance, writing, reading, and even, on occasion,\
  \ through our feet. But we must be willing to take the opportunity, to take our\
  \ shoes off, to let our hair down, to embrace the mystery of intuition and love\
  \ and passion and feeling. To be women. And to be wild."
