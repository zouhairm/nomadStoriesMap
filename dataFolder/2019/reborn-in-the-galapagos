Text: "I look out of the plane window and see a deserted island surrounded by a deep\
  \ blue sea. Looking towards the horizon, I see high mountains and arid vegetation\
  \ that makes me wonder if I was still on this earth. Gal\xE1pagos is completely\
  \ different to everything I have seen. \nThe airplane doors open and I walk out,\
  \ timid, insecure of what I would find. Hot air and a bright sun welcome me as I\
  \ walk down the stairs into the airport terminal. But wait, the terminal is the\
  \ airport, small, cozy, and hot. Baltra Island is home to the gateway of the Galapagos\
  \ to the rest of the word. \n\u201CHow do we get to our hotel?\u201D \u2013 I turn\
  \ towards my Ecuadorian boyfriend of 3 months. \u201CWe need to go to Santa Cruz\u201D\
  \ \u2013 he replies \u2013 \u201CThis is just the airport\u201D. \nSurprised by\
  \ the discovery that this island is just an airport, I follow him to the ferry that\
  \ would take us to the next island, Santa Cruz. While I look into the water, I remember\
  \ the promise I made him the day before. I would allow him to teach me how to swim\
  \ during this trip. Yes, I am a rack of nerves. Despite growing up in the Caribbean,\
  \ my fear of drowning runs deep into my veins. \nI notice that we are now driving,\
  \ up and down hills. The leafless trees dominate the landscape. My boyfriend is\
  \ talking to our driver and I pretend that I am listening while I wonder how long\
  \ is the drive to the little town, Puerto Ayora. We stop in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ \u201CHere you have the crater of an extinct volcano\u201D \u2013 says the driver\
  \ proudly pointing us to the right. We get down to take pictures and I can see the\
  \ big space that used to be a volcano. Its vegetation is magnificent. I then realized\
  \ that I'm on top of a mountain and that this is the first volcano I have seen in\
  \ my life. \nI first catch a glimpse of the most populous town in the Galapagos,\
  \ Puerto Ayora, while driving down a hill. The small town looks enchanting. The\
  \ main street runs along the sea and it\u2019s full of colors and life. Street vendors\
  \ decorate the walkway with their crafts and souvenirs. We walk into the pier while\
  \ I admire the blue water. Sea lions are hanging out at the pier. One of them was\
  \ blocking my way to the small boat that would take us to our hotel. I look at my\
  \ boyfriend for reassurance and his amused face irritates me.\nWe have the most\
  \ amazing view from our local hotel. The sea with its different shades of blue,\
  \ the little town in the horizon, and the hundreds of boats. We take a walk to \u201C\
  Las Grietas\u201D a nearby  canyon filled with clear water. The landscape is breathtaking\
  \ and my boyfriend swims for a while. I'm too scared, thus I stay on top of a rock.\
  \ \nWalking back down the trail we find Playa Los Alemanes, a shallow, tranquil,\
  \ and clear beach that my boyfriend deems perfect for my swimming lessons. He attempts\
  \ to teach me for two long hours, the longest two hours of my life. The moment I\
  \ can feel the water on my face I panic, thinking I am drowning. I start by kicking\
  \ with him holding me, then he lets me go, and I sink. I feel paralyzed. All I can\
  \ think of is that I am going to die away from my family, in the other side of the\
  \ world. \nI feel my boyfriend\u2019s hand pulling me out. \u201CStand up\u201D\
  \ \u2013 he says laughing- \u201Cyou can\u2019t drown here, the water is shallow\u201D\
  . I feel all the colors coming to my face, I'm embarrassed. There I am, standing,\
  \ with water up to my waist.\n I finally learned to swim that week. Nevertheless,\
  \ Galapagos taught me more than that. I didn't know it back then but I also gained\
  \ a husband there. You see, he decided he would marry me after that trip. These\
  \ magical islands forever hold a part of me. They kept my fear and gave me courage."
