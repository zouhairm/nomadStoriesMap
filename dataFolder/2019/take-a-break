Text: "It\u2019s getting late. The sun is chasing us down as the road turns to mud.\
  \ We weave through palm trees, past children playing baseball, over dirt mounds\
  \ and through an enormous, murky puddle. Technology hasn\u2019t let us down yet,\
  \ and frankly, I can\u2019t believe that this \u201Croad\u201D is recognised by\
  \ Google Maps at all. \n\nWe arrive at a fork in the dirt, and the GPS signals our\
  \ arrival. \n\nWe hesitantly step out of our beat-up Chevy Suburban, which had been\
  \ bogged in the sand earlier that day, only to realise that technology indeed has\
  \ let us down this time. All in the pursuit of a free, beach campsite in Baja California,\
  \ but there is nowhere in sight to pitch a tent. We take in our surroundings, becoming\
  \ all too aware that we have no idea where we\u2019re going to sleep tonight. \n\
  \nWe must look like fish out of water; Two Aussie\u2019s, piling out of a huge truck\
  \ with Nebraska licence plates on a beach in Mexico. To our left is a palapa. Four\
  \ gringos are polishing off their dinner, licking their fingers and belly laughing\
  \ over a bottle of wine. Tiny kittens and puppies romp around the table legs in\
  \ the dirt of this makeshift restaurant. A Mexican woman, who fries up the catch\
  \ of the day, is conversing animatedly with her guests in Spanglish while whipping\
  \ up a storm in the kitchen.  \n\nIt\u2019s the last thing that we expect to find\
  \ at the end of the road, but luckily we did. We explain our predicament to the\
  \ Americans, somewhat distracted by cuddling puppies in the odd scene that we have\
  \ stumbled upon. \u201CThere isn\u2019t a campsite around here is there?\u201D We\
  \ ask puzzled, \u201CNo, but Maria will probably let you camp on the beach here\
  \ if you throw her a couple of pesos\u201D they answer. We apologise for interrupting\
  \ their dinner, which looks positively mouth-watering after a long day on the road,\
  \ excusing ourselves, but they are intrigued by us. \u201CWhat are you two doing\
  \ in San Bruno and why on Earth did you think there was a campsite here?\u201D\n\
  \nWe relay the adventures of our American road-trip, starting with quitting our\
  \ jobs in Melbourne, to purchasing a vehicle in the middle of nowhere Nebraska,\
  \ driving through the Badlands, exploring the geysers of Yellowstone, winding through\
  \ the Rocky Mountains with hitchhikers in the back and hiking the Narrows of Zion\
  \ National Park. They are captivated by our anecdotes for close to half an hour\
  \ before asking for the bill and inviting us to follow them home, where they live\
  \ next door to an RV Park. \n\nBy the time we arrive at our companion\u2019s house,\
  \ they invite us in for a drink which quickly turns into two, three, maybe more.\
  \ \u201COh, you know what, we have a guest room, you seem like good folks, make\
  \ yourselves at home!\u201D I\u2019m completely lost for words. I can\u2019t believe\
  \ the kindness of strangers. We insist that we head to the RV Park, and they insist\
  \ unremittingly that we stay. This is either how horror stories are made or lifelong\
  \ friendships\u2026 we\u2019ll find out. So we stay. \n\nThe hot shower and cold\
  \ air conditioning are appreciated more than we can explain. We wake to the aroma\
  \ of a freshly brewed coffee, and Helen frying up some eggs. \u201CWe\u2019re having\
  \ friends over for a barbecue tomorrow night, and they\u2019re all dying to meet\
  \ the Aussie nomads so we think you should stay one more night.\u201D So we do.\
  \ We laugh and drink and feast together. Every time we offer our assistance in the\
  \ kitchen, Wiley pulls out his favourite catchphrase, \u201CTake a break\u201D.\
  \ Still a child at heart, he\u2019s in awe of our youthful moxie to leave everything\
  \ behind to travel and his eyes glaze over as he dreams of a past in which he wishes\
  \ he had done the same. \n\nWe still can\u2019t quite believe the generosity of\
  \ Helen and Wiley to adopt us strays. Just two months later we learn that Wiley\
  \ has suffered a stroke.  It is one of those sobering, albeit clich\xE9 \u2018life\
  \ is too short, do it while you\u2019re young\u2019 moments. And so we took a break."
