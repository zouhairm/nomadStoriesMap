Text: "That they wore Texas Rangers baseball hats and were talking about Jesus wasn\u2019\
  t surprising. You acquire your sports team and your religion the same way, by birth.\
  \ After finishing their group devotional at La Guardia Airport, gate D9, the aging\
  \ Christian men from Abilene explained to us, their captive audience, they had finished\
  \ a two week tour of baseball stadiums, where \u201Cthe Lord sent us knuckleheads.\u201D\
  \ After more prayers, a deadringer for Hank Hill of King of the Hill performed stand\
  \ up, offering two-liners that punchlined with what women meant when they said,\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m fine\u201D and \u201Cno really, I\u2019m fine.\u201D Then he sermonized\
  \ about how the devil worked, picking away at your soul a little at a time, reminding\
  \ me of a guy in Texas who dumped me because I played devil's advocate, all the\
  \ time. \n\nI was returning to Texas to finalize my divorce with a city whose inferiority\
  \ complex rivaled New York\u2019s superiority complex. When I left, some said, \u201C\
  Dallas needs you,\u201D when I arrived, many said, \u201CNew York doesn\u2019t need\
  \ anyone.\u201D Movers used my boxes to prop open doors for paramedics taking a\
  \ man out of my new apartment building on a stretcher. \nIn the elevator, a neighbor\
  \ in a Yankees jersey, said, \u201CYou moved here from...?\u201D\n\u201CTexas.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou might as well be from a foreign country. It's not like Texas here. If\
  \ you say hello to someone, you look crazy. Watch out for crazies.\u201D\n\nAs we\
  \ boarded the plane, the Christian men said hello to everyone, looking like crazies.\
  \ \nI looked at my ticket and tensed. My seat assignment placed me next to Hank\
  \ Hill.\n\nWith Captain of the Jesus team in seat 25C, his elbows already overtaking\
  \ our armrest, and me, Devil's Advocate, slipping into seat 25B, I stopped the conversation\
  \ I feared we were going to have, by keeping my face unexpressive, and opening the\
  \ previous year\u2019s bestseller about empathy. \n\n\u201CYou know what your mama\
  \ would tell you?\u201D Hank leaned towards me. \u201CYou shouldn't be reading without\
  \ your reading light.\u201D \nMy mom would say those exact words.\n\u201CYou got\
  \ choo a pretty decent light up there. Maybe you should think about using it.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYou're right.\u201D I turned on the light, hoping he\u2019d leave me alone.\
  \ \nHank Hill stared me down sideways. \u201CSomeone's not happy.\u201D \nI jolted.\
  \ \nHis cheeks changed colors. \u201CHer ears are popping.\u201D\n\nThen I heard\
  \ the baby crying. Babies crying on airplanes are a postmodern opera, a scatter\
  \ of notes, easy for me to ignore. He felt all the expressed pain, aisles away.\
  \ \n\nHe leaned over the armrest. \u201CAre you going home?\u201D\n\nQuestions like\
  \ that troubled me. \n\n\u201CNew York is my new home. Dallas is my old home.\u201D\
  \n\u201CDo you follow baseball?\u201D He smiled.\n\u201CLast Spring, a guy took\
  \ me to a Yankees game? I was surprised. Most of the time, the players don\u2019\
  t hit the ball. I googled statistics and learned the best players\u2026\u201D\n\u201C\
  Don\u2019t even hit the ball half the time.\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s shocking. Do\
  \ you play baseball?\u201D\n\u201CI did. When I was a kid.\u201D\n\nMy favorite\
  \ childhood sport was How-Fast-Can-I-Get-Kicked-Out-of-Sunday-School.\n\n\u201C\
  What did you learn from visiting stadiums?\u201D\n\u201CFenway was the best, because\
  \ it has kept its history.\u201D\n\u201CFenway. Are you a Red Sox fan?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Absolutely not.\u201D \n\nThe pilot made an announcement - we could unfasten our\
  \ safety belts. I felt the peace I only felt on airplanes, untethered, speeding\
  \ over the arrow between points A and B, with my history erased. Whatever had happened\
  \ and whatever was going to happen, I was freed from both. \n\nWhen the plane landed,\
  \ I struggled to pull my baggage out of the overhead and held up the line. The men\
  \ stayed still, focusing their attention on me, rattling me. I pulled harder on\
  \ my bag\u2019s handles and exhaled. \n\nHank Hill stepped forwards and raised his\
  \ hands. Our eyes locked. His transmitted pure concern. \u201CYou okay?\u201D \n\
  \nOne more strong tug, I got my bag down and delivered the punchline.\n\u201CI'm\
  \ fine. No really. I'm fine.\u201D"
