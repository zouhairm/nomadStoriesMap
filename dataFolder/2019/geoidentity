Text: "Who are you, and what is your why?\nWhy did you get up this morning, why did\
  \ you come here?\n\_\nOur identity, defined by the places in which we live, by the\
  \ language we speak, by the boundaries that separate us from the other, reveals\
  \ a labile and disconnected human geography.\nGeography has the power to draw our\
  \ bodies and our lives, showing a strength that we can hardly oppose.\nWhen you\
  \ come across it, in its politics and spatiality, you find yourself in a physical\
  \ cage.\nYou become a prisoner of places, and to prove it, just cross the borders,\
  \ become political refugees and look for a home in a distant country.\nWe become\
  \ prisoners of time, whose temporal immobility generates a suspension from space\
  \ and everyday life, turning people into traveling bodies, traveling without ever\
  \ reaching a final destination.\nThis happens when these boundaries cross you. When\
  \ this geography defines you.\nAnd now tell me, who you are, and what's your why.\n\
  \_\nChile, the opposite border, even if not known, is the choice of millions of\
  \ refugees and migrants who escape from the loss of control and geographical and\
  \ political balance.\nHere I met people who knew exactly why they had got up in\
  \ the morning, and why they had come up there, but with some difficulty answering\
  \ who they were.\nI've always been obsessed with movement, be it corporeal, molecular,\
  \ geographic, human. Every day our bodies move, turning into bodies in action: moving\
  \ with, against or towards something. Movement is an absolute reaction to life,\
  \ because you are exactly choosing to move, or not, you are only forced to do it,\
  \ even when it is the last thing you would like to do. But it is this incredible\
  \ \"ability to move\" that saves you and pushes you to migrate.\n\n\nIn this journey\
  \ of research started on the opposite border, many issues related to mobility, identity,\
  \ spatiality and politics converge in a complicated relationship between them.\n\
  The observation of landscapes, cities, neighborhoods, languages \u200B\u200Bthat\
  \ change following the human movement tells us how the theme of migration has impact\
  \ on space.\nIn Chile, a girl born to French parents living in Santiago, made her\
  \ debut during a conversation, with an incredible 'Oui po', that for those who lived\
  \ and traveled in Chile it is impossible not to find it funny, because literary\
  \ translation of the famous' Si little (used to say \"Sure\"), as well as the result\
  \ of this incredible mix of cultures.\n\nAnd here I am in Santiago, Chile, where\
  \ I discovered that the second largest Arab community in the world outside the Arab\
  \ world is located. About 300,000 people,\na piece of the Middle East in South America!\n\
  This movement is observed within the city, but it is above all in a neighborhood\
  \ where this Arab world is erected: in Patronato.\n\nThe landscapes, the buildings,\
  \ the smells, the people in the street change.\nSyrians, Palestinians, welcome you\
  \ into their homes, and for a moment of \"Chilean\" there is nothing left. Here\
  \ people sip their coffee with cardamom and savor oriental desserts. The signs are\
  \ in another language and the inviting scent of Falafel makes you quickly settle\
  \ into one of the many restaurants.\n\nDuring my experience in Chile, I was lucky\
  \ enough to volunteer at a shelter for Syrian refugees and migrants, where I did\
  \ a Creative Writing course, transforming a simple Spanish class into a small system\
  \ of conversation, exchange and connection between people, as well as a useful exercise\
  \ to learn more about the language. The result was completely unexpected, not just\
  \ texts, but documents that tell firsthand what these people have lived and are\
  \ experiencing\nIn all this writing, data, interviews have become instruments, because\
  \ the real guide of the project has been to shift its center of gravity to human\
  \ nature.\n\n\"Responsibly irresponsible\", let's ask ourselves difficult questions,\
  \ listen, experiment, collaborate and find inspiration in strange and unexpected\
  \ places and people \". Perhaps we will meet opportunities for future innovations\
  \ thanks to this design dialogue.\nInstead of focusing on the human-machine connection,\
  \ perhaps we should connect human minds."
