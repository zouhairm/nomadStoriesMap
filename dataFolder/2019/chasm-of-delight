Text: "You know how the story goes..... A defiant girl wanderlust girl wishes to travel\
  \ the world, an eccentric boy who wishes for nothing but intimacy with solitude\
  \ and a book for his soul have a chance encounter when they meet at a quaint coffee\
  \ shop along the Italian coastline\nShe happened to be taking a stroll along the\
  \ narrow cobbled streets of the town where you could smell the sea breeze in the\
  \ air and the simmered kisses of the sun when she saw him through the coffee shop\
  \ window. She stopped and examined his features from his slanted eyes and steely\
  \ gaze, to his defined lips and nose. But those weren\u2019t the reasons for her\
  \ abrupt halt. He gazed out into the distance as if longing for something to come\
  \ to him that had him waiting for all his life. His gentle gaze caught her attention\
  \ and made her think about when she too would  often gazed out the way into the\
  \ void the very same way he was doing in that moment. \nShe walked in to the coffee\
  \ shop that oozed comfort and where the aroma of coffee loomed heavily in the air.\
  \ The walls were aged with time and had a rustic which added ambience  to them and\
  \ to the coffee shop\nShe glided across the coffee shop to where he continued gazing\
  \ out the window where his coffee had gone cold and an open book which was worn\
  \ from how often he read it. She plodded herself across from him which did not startle\
  \ him. He continued staring out the window like nothing happened only to shift his\
  \ gaze to her as if he was expecting an old friend who had just returned from a\
  \ hard days labour out at sea. She sat and stared at him for a while until he looked\
  \ back at her as if they\u2019ve had a symphony of conversations amongst one another\
  \ and nothing needed to be said yet everything was at the tip of their tongues waiting\
  \ to be spewed. \nThey have an inexplicable moment where they souls gleamed for\
  \ one another but all the could bring themselves to do was smile at each other wryly\
  \ as if to mock the other to be the first to divulge who they are to the other.\
  \ \nSo they sat there. Hours on end, gazing at each other as if to let their souls\
  \ do the talking while they sat enraptured by each other In The silence which encumbered\
  \ them from uttering a single word."
