Text: "Year 2013 was running, my life was bored, normal and quite empty. Some day,\
  \ in a random dinner my parents asked if I wanted to go Thai with friends (bff)\
  \ between laughing and scared I said: ok. Planned maps, routes, first day of all,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t plane to met in the middle of Bangkok an old man that recommend\
  \ us to go north way. Shorty later we were our way up to my unexpected encounter.\
  \ \nI\u2019ve my dreadlocks for a few years, and I thought \u201Csure there are\
  \ no Asian Rasta or so...\u201D (yes I know: stupid thought) \nFIRST day of trekking\
  \ in the jungle oye tourguide was a Rasta fellow! kind polity and fun.  \nMy friends\
  \ and I were so unplugged with the tour (2days trekking for which we didn\u2019\
  t prepare anything! Not even underwear\u2019s!!! Yes: really stupid girls back then)\
  \ but even tough we were completed.  The feeling of all our mistakes been overpass\
  \ by our strength and friendship(ness) it was unique! Better than graduating or\
  \ winning a free meal, lol.\nConsider please that we have a lot of inconveniences:\
  \ no mosquito spray, no clothes, it rain all 2 days, nothing get dry, we felt down\
  \ uncountless times, a pie of shoes were burnt, OK OK, this can be long, but you\
  \ can get the idea. \nSo after this, my life changed. Was like magic. I have dreams,\
  \ expectations, I was hungry of more, so I stayed 2 full weeks while my bff were\
  \ at some beaches getting sunburns (they actually like it) \nNow, 6 years later\
  \ I\u2019m back at hometome, after spending the last 4 years in this jungle city.\
  \ \nYeap! This woman came back a year after this trekking I\u2019ve told before\
  \ to spent life and create a tour agency in Spanish to \u201Csurvive\u201D the dream.\
  \ \nI got the BF, the work, but then my roots where missed. It felt like Santeria;\
  \ something was not fully right; why I\u2019m here?so I remembered the old man in\
  \ Bangkok. I never saw him again but I still remember him like it was yesterday\
  \ that he sent me to \u201Cmy destiny\u201D and gratefully I figure it out to trust\
  \ him. You can call it Santeria, but he was like my crystal ball, and I was SO happy\
  \ just for  believing."
