Text: "In this world where your closest friend can turn out to be someone you don\u2019\
  t know at all, or your partner for many years could be hiding secrets from you,\
  \ or where you could lose your life or belongings in an instant, it\u2019s very\
  \ hard to have faith in people. I\u2019ve long had issues in this area: I find it\
  \ very difficult to get into relationships, I\u2019m pretty skeptic about new information\
  \ I hear or read, and as harsh as it may sound, but sometimes, I can\u2019t help\
  \ but trust only myself.\n\nOne solo trip, however, changed this all. I was surprising\
  \ how one trip became instrumental in regaining that childhood trait adulthood stole\
  \ from me. \n\nMy location: Davao City, Philippines\n\nFirstly, I stayed in the\
  \ homes of people I barely know. I was working on a low budget so I decided to try\
  \ Couchsurfing for the first time. I sent a message to a female host named Mae,\
  \ got instant confirmation that I didn\u2019t have time for second thoughts, and\
  \ showed up at her doorstep. I have no idea why but I wasn't my usual self then:\
  \ I trusted that I would wake up alive and with complete limbs the next morning\
  \ and that the breakfast she prepared for me doesn\u2019t have poison. And you know\
  \ what? I was right to give my full trust. I\u2019ve found a new girlfriend in her.\n\
  \nThere was also a time when I spent a night away from Mae\u2019s home. I had no\
  \ pre-booked accommodation on an island where the resorts were all fully booked.\
  \ I then walked aimlessly to what I felt was a street full of transient houses.\
  \ Not too long afterwards, I noticed a man following me.\n\nI looked at him and\
  \ he asked me: \u201CAre you looking for a place to stay?\u201D\n\nI said, \u201C\
  Yes\u201D\n\nHe was soon accompanied by his wife. They brought me to a two-story\
  \ house and told the owner I needed a room. After bargaining for the rate, I got\
  \ myself an air-conditioned room for PHP 400 (8 USD). Even if I noticed that the\
  \ door\u2019s lock was broken, I slept through the night. Well, if anything wrong\
  \ happens, at least I\u2019ve had a full beauty rest, right?\n\nSecondly, I tried\
  \ \u201Chabal-habal\u201D or motorcycle taxi. Here, the passenger would sit at the\
  \ back of the driver, with no form of security equipment whatsoever. It\u2019s a\
  \ cheap and adventurous form of transportation in this part of the world. It doesn\u2019\
  t have a good reputation though, as obviously, the driver could take you anywhere\
  \ and you have zero power over it. Unless, you jump off the motorcycle where you\
  \ could sustain some injuries.\n\nI rented one on my way to Hagimit Falls, Samal\
  \ Island because it was the only mode of transport available. The ride lasted for\
  \ two hours and guess what, I didn\u2019t feel the slightest fear. I just placed\
  \ a strong hand on the driver\u2019s shoulders, enjoyed the wind touching my face,\
  \ and hoped for safety. Again, I earned an instant friend through Melbar, the habal-habal\
  \ driver. \n\nThirdly, I held hands with strangers. As I was trying to pose for\
  \ photographs in Hagimit Falls, I slipped on a tree branch and fell straight to\
  \ the water. I\u2019m no swimmer so I slightly feared for my life. Luckily, someone\
  \ pulled me from the water towards a safe area. It was James, a lifeguard/tour guide.\
  \ He then brought me to the other attractions, asked me to jump off one of the high\
  \ waterfalls, and directed me to the best places for photographs.\n\nIn Hagimit\
  \ Falls, everything was so slippery. I held hands with James, Melbar, and other\
  \ travelers who were kind enough to help. It was a very humbling experience.\n\n\
  I certainly wouldn\u2019t be caught dead doing any of these in my comfort zone:\
  \ if I have friends and families who are one text away from rescuing me. But since\
  \ I\u2019m in a faraway land, I was completely at the mercy of strangers and it\
  \ made me realize that asking for help isn\u2019t bad at all! On my plane ride back\
  \ home, I knew for sure that my faith in humanity was restored."
