Text: 'i am so excited by the time when i visit the most colourful and rich city with
  culture and story"portugal" .

  That was one year ago since my visit and i still missing the moment that i capture
  , specially the little town with stunning and art architecture ,taking the hop on
  hop off bus for a day touring the city listening the story about portugal trying
  the local food was quite fantastic day. I end up staying two day is the city then
  head to sintra another little town that full of fairytail story and high up the
  hill side.I remmember i had a chance to visit one beautiful farm house that turn
  into wedding venue call " la quinta " by standing there i knew one day this place
  will be my wedding venue its absolutely stunning ...

  Then the next day i visited the castle and the garden with a local driver who knows
  all the detail story about sintra , he is been grew up there and the story pass
  on into the generation. The castle was so colourful bright yellow and you could
  even see from far away its made by love from the king for the queen, you walk into
  hydrengia garden through the step to the top of the look out i saw breathtaking
  view of sintra all the tree that planted non of it original sintra its been brought
  by the king from different country and plant it there.

  Another stunning castle was the gothic castle ,this one is different then the ontger
  one . Its build on top of the cave the iconic stairs the chilly themperature and
  the detail in each building are crafted and made it a masterpieces .Everything about
  Sintra too much detail to talk about it ,the best way is to visit portugal and create
  your story'
