Text: "My first plane ride, trip alone and travelling far from home was to Ecuador\
  \ for volunteer building. I\u2019d always liked a challenge, and I\u2019d been dreaming\
  \ of flying away somewhere warm to help the world. At 4am in late May, I took off\
  \ for South America.\n\n As it flew, I found myself complaining about the quality\
  \ of the cheap headphones I\u2019d bought for the trip. I laughed at myself, thinking\
  \ about how I was just about to embark on 3 weeks of living in a remote jungle without\
  \ the comforts of home, and here I was complaining about headphones. The 9 hours\
  \ intermission between flights was where I met my group members. We talked about\
  \ where we were from, our schools, our hobbies. Instantly, it was easy to put people\
  \ into groups of who would get along, who would probably share a room, and who I\u2019\
  d be friends with. We each had a role.\n\nUpon landing, we waited another 2 hours\
  \ for the bus to arrive, then traveled the next 4 along a winding road of tropical\
  \ trees, speeding down the thin road in the pitch black night as the rain pounded\
  \ down on the tin roof. We finally arrived in a tiny village called Mishualli at\
  \ 5am. This was it, I had landed in Ecuador and my adventure could begin.\n\nThe\
  \ first week we spend in shifts of teaching English to young kids and building them\
  \ a sanitary bathroom. Our tour leader told us, when somebody asked, that we don\u2019\
  t build them houses or anything like that because if you give them too much, the\
  \ villagers will become lazy. Why work when people fly over and give everything\
  \ to you? An interesting point, I thought. I\u2019d head a lot about humanitarian\
  \ projects, but this, I thought, could be an unforeseen consequence those projects\
  \ don\u2019t consider. I\u2019d heard so much about Westerners feeling they should\
  \ help the Global South improve their quality of life, but these kids showed us\
  \ their favorite game of rock racing, and they seemed happier than the kids back\
  \ home glued to their iPads.\n\nThat week, we had kids hanging off of us, giggle,\
  \ all day. They helped dig and taught us new words in Spanish. Every night it would\
  \ rain, and every day began with scooping heaps of muddy water out of our hole to\
  \ dig further down. We\u2019d ride home through the sunny jungle in the back of\
  \ pickup trucks with a canopy of trees lining one side of the road and tall, rocked\
  \ hills lining the other, joking about the day, laughing at someone who fell in\
  \ the mud. \n\nSome days we\u2019d stop at a remote waterfall for a swim, but most\
  \ days we\u2019d clean ourselves in the outdoor shower. 5 people would be there\
  \ at once, peeling off hard, mudded socks and trying to get the dirt out of their\
  \ eyebrows. In the evening, we\u2019d walk down to the smoothie bar, getting juice\
  \ and pizza, and use the only wifi spot in town to call home. Each night was something\
  \ new. Sometimes the others went to the bar, most nights I stayed in to read and\
  \ write. When we were all together, we played card games and shared stories from\
  \ our lives. We were family.\n\nOver the few weeks, I felt more like I was at Summer\
  \ camp than far away from home. I missed my family and called them often, but everybody\
  \ fell into their place in this 18 member family. Joey, the goofball, had a ridiculous\
  \ laugh and became as close as brothers with Zac. They found weed everywhere we\
  \ traveled. Samara was sassy and would decide what was going on when nobody could.\
  \ Tanner and Brandon, two friends from Kentucky, insulted each other whenever they\
  \ could. We formed a group together with Meggan, who openly asked everybody if they\u2019\
  d been having trouble pooping too, since they landed. \n\nI came home having made\
  \ 17 new brothers and sisters. I had no idea that the kids of the village we taught\
  \ would remind me how simple having fun was, and I never expected that I\u2019d\
  \ learn so much about myself in the middle of the jungle."
