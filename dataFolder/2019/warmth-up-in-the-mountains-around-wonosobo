Text: "Yogyakarta hit me in layers. There was this modern, post-reformasi city of\
  \ intellectuals and Starbucks-sipping students, with stratums of colonial and Sriwijaya\
  \ era structures nestled between the malls and hotels like Tetris pieces. The harmony\
  \ with which the old is juxtapositioned with the new is the most beautiful part\
  \ of Yogyakarta, or \"Jogja\" as it is often shortened to. I smiled back at the\
  \ septuagenarian becak (pedicab) driver whose face contorted into a toothless grin\
  \ with a, \"hello mister!\" as he creaked past. It occurred to me that he wanted\
  \ nothing from me, other than to simply give me a friendly greeting. This culture\
  \ of cordial pleasantries permeates through Jogja; smiles and respectful nods greet\
  \ you from all directions. I was soon infected and was also rocking the Javanese\
  \ head-bob greeting with a sheepish smile at everyone.\n\nThe next morning, I headed\
  \ by car for the Dieng Plateau, a vast highland with peaks, valleys, and picturesque\
  \ lakes. The air was crisp up in the higher altitudes and the shrubbery looked less\
  \ tropical and more alpine. After a sharp upward bank, a panorama was revealed with\
  \ seven famous peaks, with several of them actively volcanic, jutting up through\
  \ the crouching clouds. The sunlight was cascading down in rays of gold, enhancing\
  \ the regolith-colored, rocky textures of the famous volcanoes, Merapi and Merbabu.\
  \ This outlook was named Ketep Pass and it made sense why so many tourists had stopped\
  \ to take in the view here. There were more domestic tourists, evidenced by their\
  \ use of Bahasa Indonesia, than foreigners. One teenaged boy made eye-contact and\
  \ as if by reflex, asked, \"where are you from, mister?\" He told me had had been\
  \ studying English and loves to practice whenever he can. After completing his course\
  \ in the city, he invited his classmates to his village in Dieng. They all shook\
  \ hands with me and asked questions I had been frequently answering in Indonesia:\
  \ \"do you like Indonesian food?\", \"You don't look Canadian, are you sure you\
  \ are Canadian?\", and \"Which places have you visited in Indonesia?\" Perhaps they\
  \ started the conversation in hopes of practicing their English but soon they were\
  \ only satisfying their curiosity. We joked and talked for a while. This human connection\
  \ forever sealed Ketep Pass in my memory as a place where I was laughing and being\
  \ playfully laughed at. \n\nThe teenaged boy invited me to lunch in his village,\
  \ a place \"not more than 10 minutes away,\" he said. The village was situated on\
  \ a ledge overlooking tea plantations. I asked my driver what the area is called.\
  \ \"Wonosobo,\" he replied, not knowing the name of the village and instead naming\
  \ the nearest city. As the platooned cars rolled into the village's only street,\
  \ the citizens poured out of their homes. Children ran up to the car and started\
  \ tapping it. I rolled down the window and waved like a monarch. Apparently, this\
  \ teenaged boy was the son of the village chief. They had the largest house and\
  \ it seemed like half the villagers had squeezed in to lunch with the foreigner.\
  \ Thumbs-up pose photos were taken once I had downed a surprisingly delicious traditional\
  \ Indonesian meal of white rice, tempeh, fried chicken, sambel, and vegetable soup.\
  \ One of the grandpas of the village showed me an old photograph of a uniformed\
  \ soldier, probably of himself when he was a strapping young lad. He vigorously\
  \ tried to tell a story about it in the Javanese language. The kids tried to translate\
  \ it into English but it seemed the essence of the story got lost in translation.\
  \ As I drove away, the whole village waved goodbye. I waved out the window for as\
  \ long as I could see them. That's all I could offer them and they seemed content\
  \ with that. I had never experienced such selfless, warm hospitality anywhere before.\n\
  \nNow, after eight years living in Yogyakarta, and becoming quite fluent in Bahasa\
  \ Indonesia and even Javanese language, perhaps it is time for me to visit that\
  \ village again. The story of the soldier is yet untold."
