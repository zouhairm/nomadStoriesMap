Text: "Since I moved to Scotland, Loch Ness has always been on top of my must-visit-place.\
  \ A mythical creature hiding in one of the most majestic nature landscape on earth,\
  \ it\u2019s too hard to pass on. So back in 2011, in the drizzle and fog of Scottish\
  \ summer I decided to drove south from Inverness to visit one of the most touristy\
  \ spot in Scotland, Loch Ness. \n\nI took the A82 motorway, arguably one of the\
  \ best motorways for road trip in Europe, because of its beautiful Scotland\u2019\
  s highland scenery. After 20 minutes drive, I remember vividly as the wiper in my\
  \ car shed the rain from the front glass. Time stood still for a moment when I gazed\
  \ the 37-km-long grey vast body of water covered with white thin mist looming on\
  \ top of its wavy surface. \n\nThat was my first sighting encounter with the infamous\
  \ Loch Ness. It\u2019s really hard not to contemplate the view at that time, and\
  \ I clearly recall that tingly sensation when I had goosebumps as I drove alongside\
  \ the loch. \n\nIn no time I reached Urquhart Castle and parked my car in front\
  \ of the visitor center. My plan was to see the loch and the landscape surrounds\
  \ it from this grounds. Sadly what\u2019s left of this solid stronghold are just\
  \ ruins of rocks and boulders.\n\n\u201CWelcome to Urquhart castle,\u201D greeted\
  \ an old man in a traditional Scotland kilt at the visitor centre  as I entered\
  \ the front building.\n\n\u201CIf ye have time, have a wee look at the movie in\
  \ the auditorium. It\u2019s the stahry (story) of the castle, and it\u2019s pure-dead-brilliant.\
  \ But if ye\u2019r in a rush, just go straight ootside (outside) and walk to the\
  \ castle. Don\u2019t forget to bring yer camera, ye might spot the Nessie today.\u201D\
  \ \n\nTo reach the castle ground I had to enter it from the front building. Once\
  \ I\u2019m inside, I immediately went to the ruins of the five-story grant tower\
  \ in the north of the grounds. The drizzled stoped, and sun started to shine amidst\
  \ the grey clouds. From this higher ground I can view the Loch Ness lies in the\
  \ horizon with the Great Glen as its background. \n\nThe wave on the loch created\
  \ long tide rolls as if a monster\u2019s shoulder was about to surface\u2026But\
  \ as the wave broke, the shoulder dove back to deep dark water. \n\n\u201CIf it\u2019\
  s windy enough, there will be more waves like that,\u201D said a security guard\
  \ standing beside me.\n\n\u201CMost of Nessie sighting occur during heavy storm\
  \ and baltic (really cold) weather. So it\u2019s hard for witnesses to distinguish\
  \ between waves and Nessie\u2019s shoulder. But it\u2019s up to yer eyes to believe\u2026\
  \u201D\n\nOn the east side of the ground there are still few moss-covered walls\
  \ standing. In between those walls there a groups of people, I\u2019m guessing tourist.\
  \ And as I passed one of the group, I recall one kid gasping in awe when he heard\
  \ the story about the Nessie from his tour leader.\n\n\u201CThe first recorded sighting\
  \ of Nessie was with St. Columba back in 565. The saint commanded the creature not\
  \ to eat the swimmers and Nessie obeyed.\u201D\n\nThe wind whistle louder as the\
  \ sun hid behind cloud, and within second the drizzle started. I guess it\u2019\
  s a sign for me to end my monster-sighting trip. When I walked back to the exit\
  \ gate through the old drawbridge, my mind were having battle over the existence\
  \ of the creature. While my brain tried combining all the scientific facts about\
  \ the lake and the monster, my other conscious resolute those facts.\n\nI lingered\
  \ in the parking area for a while and keep looking back at the loch. As I glazed\
  \ the rolling waves that rolls in giant barrels towards the castle shore, my mind\
  \ finally concluded the monster existence debate. The experience of walking along\
  \ the shore of the loch and the ruins of the castle will give you a new perspective\
  \ towards the existence of Nessie.\n\nLastly, never would I expected that my first\
  \ visit to the legendary Loch Ness would changes me into a believer. One clearly\
  \ does not necessarily need eyes in order to believe."
