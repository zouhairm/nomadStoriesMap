Text: "One day suddenly my friend in Pakistan called me and invited me to come to\
  \ Pakistan so I went there enjoyed alot and came back. Well this does not happen\
  \ in real life for common man like me.\nIt was a long struggle to get the Pakistani\
  \ visa. Even after getting the visa it was not easy to decide whether to go or not,\
  \ visiting Pakistan is a far fetched idea for common folks in India.\nWhenever Pakistan\
  \ is discussed most Indians are filled with hatred and vengeance, as if they have\
  \ personal scores to settle and not to my surprise many people discouraged me not\
  \ to go .\nSome people even said things like my passport will loosen its value and\
  \ some said both the intelligence agencies will keep a watch on me. But I was determined\
  \ to go. I always had the curiosity of knowing more about the life of the people\
  \ on the other side of the border and it is this curiosity which took me there.\n\
  Thanks to my relatives in Karachi who sent me all the documents required to get\
  \ the visa. The moment I got the visa I was stoked to visit Pakistan and what added\
  \ more to my excitement that I was going to cross the Wagah border to enter Pakistan\
  \ as I opted for bus to go there.\nThe feeling when the gate opens at the border\
  \ and the bus goes is amazing.\nAfter crossing the border I was in Lahore within\
  \ minutes. When I first arrived in Lahore places like Chandni Chowk, Delhi Gate\
  \ made me feel as if was still in Delhi. But there were many cultural differences\
  \ as well, most of the men were wearing shalwar kamiz which I later came to know\
  \ is the national dress of Pakistan. People were speaking Punjabi which again made\
  \ me felt like I was in Indian Punjab but all the sign boards were written in Urdu\
  \ which was different from the Indian Punjab. Soon I took a train to Karachi because\
  \ I only had the visa of Karachi which actually frustrated me because as being a\
  \ mountain lover I wanted to see the Karakoram Range and also wanted to explore\
  \ other cities like Islamabad and Peshawar. But on the brighter side I got more\
  \ time to explore Karachi,the biggest city of Pakistan.\nAs I arrived in Karachi\
  \ I was introduced with the amazing \u201Cmehman nawazi\u201D (hospitality) for\
  \ which Pakistan is known for. People were very warm welcoming and were curious\
  \ to know about India specially Bollywood.\nMy uncles took care of me very well\
  \ and my cousins accompanied me to the different tourist attractions there like\
  \ Mazar e Quaid and beautiful sea beaches. Before coming to Karachi I had heard\
  \ a lot about Karachi being similar to Mumbai and I found it true when I visited\
  \ the sea bound areas and huge malls which reminded me of Mumbai. I spent total\
  \ of 22 days in Karachi and it passed like a wink of an eye. While I was set to\
  \ return I was feeling very heavy to leave my loved ones as I knew I am not coming\
  \ here anytime soon or this can also turn out to be my first and last visit to Pakistan.\
  \ But with all the good memories I travelled back to Lahore from where I had the\
  \ return bus. I had one day on my side before taking the bus so I made the most\
  \ of it by visiting some of the famous sites in Lahore like Minar e Pakistan, Tomb\
  \ of Jahangir etc.\nIt was an experience of a lifetime and after returning I realized\
  \ that we need to keep the political differences between the two nations aside.\
  \ We can\u2019t afford to be swayed by all the political rhetoric.\nWe are being\
  \ brainwashed into believing Pakistan to be the enemy country without being aware\
  \ of the historical background. We need to look beyond the political animosity.\
  \ That will never happen until we travel to Pakistan more often and interact with\
  \ the people. It\u2019s high time we stop spreading hatred, we should believe in\
  \ the phrase VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBAKAM of the Upnishad which means the world is a family."
