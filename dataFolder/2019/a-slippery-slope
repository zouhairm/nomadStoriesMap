Text: "\u201CTRY TO AVOID THE ROCKS!\u201D yelled a trekker observing me helplessly\
  \ careening feet-first down the snow-soaked side of the volcano.  I quickly retracted\
  \ my floundering hand as it bounced off the sharp volcanic rock it was seeking to\
  \ stop this slide. I resign myself to this terrifying uncontrollable descent amongst\
  \ the stony, mountainous landscape. \n\nI cursed my luck as despite not seeing another\
  \ soul on the trail until now, of course there was now an audience to witness my\
  \ fall. I arise, dusting off the snow now seeping into my hiking pants and investigate\
  \ the scrapes on my hands. No other injuries were apparent, and I was able to continue\
  \ the tramp in this stark yet beautiful national park.  \n\nThe Tongariro Alpine\
  \ Crossing has become a hiking (or \u2018tramping\u2019 as New Zealanders call it)\
  \ destination for locals and travellers alike due to its alluring landscape. However,\
  \ few inexperienced hikers decide to complete the trek solo, in the questionable\
  \ conditions that early spring can bring. \nEvery contactable organisation had confirmed\
  \ that on this September day there would be no snow on the track, and the track\
  \ could be completed solo without the crampons or ice picks usually requisite for\
  \ the season. Starting it as most do in Mangatepopo, I set out armed only with snacks,\
  \ water, a phone with no service, and a pair of well-loved hiking boots with little\
  \ knowledge of what awaited me\n. \nA wooden path elevates the trail above the volcanic\
  \ marshland that precedes one of the finest sights of the trek, Mt Ruapehu\u2019\
  s snowy peaks eerily swathed in cloud. Doesn\u2019t sound familiar? Perhaps Mt Doom\
  \ from the Lord of the Rings stirs a recollection? Mt Ruapehu was used in scenes\
  \ to represent the volcanic mountain in the film trilogy, and its severe black outline\
  \ in the landscape distinctly echoes mythical landscapes. \n\nAfter approximately\
  \ half an hour of ascending through valleys formed from volcanoes, passing by tiny\
  \ trickling waterfalls, I round the corner and all that can be seen to the horizon\
  \ is a broad field of snow. Was I not informed that there would be no snow and therefore\
  \ no need for ice picks and crampons? Will it be possible to navigate the unforgiving\
  \ ridges of Tongariro National Park without the necessary equipment? Breathing in\
  \ sharply cold mountainous air, I ruminate the possibilities. To turn back and stay\
  \ safe, or persevere? \n\nIt was inevitable. I had to continue and traverse this\
  \ intricately harsh and vast landscape. \n\nOne thing striking factor that differentiates\
  \ Tongariro from other low altitude mountainous hikes is the extraordinarily harsh\
  \ and quickly changing weather conditions. Despite September being a mere three\
  \ months before Summer in the Southern hemisphere, it abruptly started drizzling\
  \ on the snowy plateaus in between the black peaks. This minimises visibility to\
  \ next to naught, rendering the poles and flags that mark the path too far and few\
  \ between. The thick clouds draw into the earth, making it hard to discern between\
  \ the snowy ground and the rainy sky. Only the shortest scrub can survive in these\
  \ conditions so there were no sheltering trees. To walk in a vague direction whilst\
  \ hoping I wasn\u2019t careering towards a peak\u2019s edge is the only option.\
  \ \n\nIn addition to this, with every volcanic peak I passed there was an accompanying\
  \ sign elucidating the warning signs of an eruption, and the steps that must be\
  \ taken in the event of such an occurrence. The constant threat of a natural disaster\
  \ is interesting motivation to keep moving, no matter how fatigued your legs become\
  \ trying to stay upright whilst tramping through intermittent rocky outcrops that\
  \ are slippery from the day\u2019s rains. \n\nHowever, as quickly as the conditions\
  \ worsened, the clouds cleared and the snow seemingly dissipated on the descent\
  \ to Ketetahi Hot Springs. The dark and distinct outlines of the volcanoes that\
  \ mark the beginning of the track morph into rolling grassy hills, lush with vegetation\
  \ and jewel-like lakes dot the the landscape. The perilous portion of the hike is\
  \ complete, and all of a sudden I could luxuriate in the lush beauty of New Zealand\u2019\
  s North Island, without threat of volcanic eruption or snowy falls down the side\
  \ of mountains."
