Text: "Nobody ever stopped here on purpose. Sanderson is an old railroad town whose\
  \ heyday came sometime between the end of the Civil War and the turn of the twentieth\
  \ century. The buildings were dilapidated, and most storefronts stood vacant. We\
  \ were at the Outback Oasis Motel by accident.\n\nThe three of us hatched the harebrained\
  \ idea to ride our old motorcycles some 900 miles into west Texas to celebrate New\
  \ Year\u2019s Eve. We rode out an inauspicious start through 40 degree temperatures,\
  \ camping in freezing weather at the Pecos, and we woke the next morning to ride\
  \ through miserable cold and rain.\n\nSomewhere past the one-horse town of Langtry,\
  \ my bike popped, fizzled, and went quiet, rolled to a silent stop on the side of\
  \ Highway 90, and I got off to assess the damage. The hiss, hiss each time the motor\
  \ cranked was as good as a death sentence: a blown head gasket in the dead of winter\
  \ in the middle of nowhere in the desert of west Texas. Soon my friends noticed\
  \ I\u2019d broken down and came back to commiserate with me. We did what any good\
  \ twenty-something Harley riders would do, we broke out the whiskey. \n\nWe spent\
  \ a while on the side of that road staring at my old bike, passing around the bottle\
  \ before a black Chevy pulled off the highway beside us. It had a Harley strapped\
  \ down in the bed.\n\n\u201CSweet bike, dudes. What year?\u201D the driver asked.\n\
  \n\u201C1968,\u201D I said.\n\n\u201CNo kiddin\u2019. You need some help?\u201D\
  \ He was on his way to drop off his bike in Del Rio. The shop there was bound to\
  \ have some head gaskets in stock. \u201CHere\u2019s my phone number,\u201D he said.\
  \ \u201CName\u2019s Juan. Call me once you figure out where you\u2019re staying.\
  \ I\u2019ll bring the gaskets to you once I\u2019m back in Sanderson tonight.\u201D\
  \n\nJuan drove away, and soon a tow truck had stopped, loaded my bike up, and dropped\
  \ it off at the Outback Oasis Motel. The front desk attendant had to be woken from\
  \ a nap, and the only other guest was a slack-jawed old man who eyed my bright-painted\
  \ Harley from a rocking chair across the parking lot with a look somewhere between\
  \ jealousy and admiration.\n\nIn the parking lot, under the watchful eyes of the\
  \ old man and a rocky mountaintop that loomed over the place like a sheer-sided\
  \ gargoyle, we began to strip the bike down. We pulled off the speedometer, the\
  \ gas tanks and the carburetor. Once night fell with a harsh desert chill, we rolled\
  \ the motorcycle into the motel room. There we began pulling the engine apart, oil\
  \ leaking on the carpet. We wrenched the front head off the cylinder and scraped\
  \ the old, blown out gasket from the surface.\n\n\u201CAt least we got the diagnosis\
  \ right,\u201D my friend said to me as he sipped a beer and wiped the surface of\
  \ the cylinder top clean with a rag.\n\nA knock came at the door and a voice shouted,\
  \ \u201CI\u2019ve got a delivery!\u201D \n\nWe opened the door to find Juan holding\
  \ a set of gaskets and a 12 pack of beer. He passed around bottles and handed me\
  \ the gaskets. \u201CI\u2019m watchin\u2019 y\u2019all work on this thing for a\
  \ bit,\u201D he said.\n\nAnd so he watched as we put the new gasket on, pieced the\
  \ engine together back into a functioning whole, and reassembled the bike. Around\
  \ two AM, he called it a night, telling us \u201CGood luck.\u201D We said our goodbyes,\
  \ thanking him for his kindness. There are good people everywhere.\n\nThe next morning,\
  \ with the Harley together again, we rolled it out of the room and started it. It\
  \ fired on the first kick. All of us shouted with joy and were beaming hungover\
  \ smiles as we strapped on our helmets and roared out of the parking lot under a\
  \ bright blue sky. Not a cloud in sight \u2013 t-shirt riding weather. It was the\
  \ best ride of my life.\n\nSome miles west we all looked as a black Chevy hauled\
  \ up beside us on the road. It was Juan. He leaned across the cab and yelled out\
  \ the open passenger window. \u201CHoly shit, you did it!\u201D"
