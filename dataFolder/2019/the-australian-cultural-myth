Text: "So I get the wallet out and am about to rise from an outdoor table when Derek,\
  \ a long-haired bikie with a shared passion for local history and Ned Kelly, observed\
  \ a similarly imposing man walk out of the caf\xE9 behind me.  \u2018I know him,\u2019\
  \ I considered inwardly, turning to conceal a smile while Derek motioned the man\
  \ over.  Friendly-faced, late-sixties, with red cheeks, strong build and a real\
  \ open, warm-hearted manner, I\u2019ve seen him, \u2018that man\u2019, here at The\
  \ Lazy Bean caf\xE9 in Cahir a few times already.  He has such a presence that no\
  \ matter how busy or occupied I\u2019ve occasionally been, it\u2019s almost impossible\
  \ not to eavesdrop on the amusing manner of his conversations.  The words flow rhythmically\
  \ and effortlessly out of his mouth to a regular ensemble of gathered \u2018guests\u2019\
  , and while an occasional swear word is often also thrown in for comic effect, each\
  \ sentence appears to cease with the sound of booming laughter.  \n\u201CSeanie,\
  \ what do you know about Ned Kelly?\u201D asked Derek.  \u201CThis Australian man,\
  \ Mike isn\u2019t it\u2026?  He says he is from around here.\u201D\n\u201CAh, no!\
  \  Not quite here.  His father was a Tipperary man to be sure, but no, not quite\
  \ here!\u201D \n\u201CI\u2019d heard his father was arrested trying to sell stolen\
  \ pigs in this square?\u201D I suggest.  \u201CMaybe it\u2019s why the Kellys were\
  \ sent to Australia?\u201D\n\u201CAh, perhaps so!?  See I have to admit I don\u2019\
  t have a lot of time for Ned Kelly,\u201D he replied quizzically, \u201CSee I\u2019\
  m a Lonergan and he shot one of my men, another Lonergan.  Of course it would have\
  \ to be that way, a Tipperary man being shot by another Tipperary man, in Australia,\
  \ the other side of the world!  You know we had a few Highway Men, we call them,\
  \ around those times, like\u2026  What are doing now?  You got a spare half-hour\u2026\
  ?\u201D\n\u201CSo you know there was a British Military barracks in town?  Just\
  \ up there, see?\u201D said Seanie, now behind the wheel of his dusty-grey, likely\
  \ previously white, busted-up old Corolla.  \u201CYou heard of the battle of Balaclava?\
  \  There were a whole lot of horses here to do with that.  Greys.  See Tipperary\
  \ is well known for horses.  It\u2019s the limestone beneath the grass you see!\u201D\
  \nWe continued driving.  Seanie talked to me about a local production he is filming\
  \ in the hope that the story will be preserved for the cultural history of the region.\
  \  The production, based on Tipperary\u2019s own version of Ned Kelly, is about\
  \ a highwayman named Willie Brennan who hid up on some hillside scrubland at the\
  \ foot of the Galtee mountains.  His \u2018bushranger\u2019 style exploits were\
  \ perhaps more famed in the heartland of neighbouring county Cork, yet Seanie is\
  \ more focused on Willie\u2019s final days and what led to his arrest and subsequent\
  \ hanging, in nearby Clonmel.  \nWe drive right up the other side to the \u2018\
  Vee\u2019, facing back towards the Galtee.  Here I understand rebels, using coloured\
  \ sheets and binoculars, passed messages to comrades while fighting for Irish Independence.\
  \  Afterwards, we descend down the green roaming hills, pausing in the middle of\
  \ the deserted road \u2013 Irish style \u2013 to observe a \u2018haunted\u2019 lake\
  \ contained within the mist of the Kilroy mountains.  It doesn\u2019t look too haunted\
  \ now, in fact sheep and goats stand prostrate in stillness, seemingly less concerned\
  \ with the water than perhaps the steepness of the terrain.  \n\u201CSo the story\
  \ goes that a woman, horribly embarrassed at a local dance, was believed to have\
  \ murdered her husband here,\u201D said Seanie.  \u201CYet more than that,\u201D\
  \ he added, creased wrinkles of intensity below his eyes, \u201Cshe is believed\
  \ to have haunted all the other men who similarly laughed at her also!  Even today,\
  \ there\u2019s still plenty of drownings and suicides\u2026\u201D\nAlthough I don\u2019\
  t find evidence of the Kelly family within these hills, something that, truth be\
  \ told, Seanie never promised me, maybe the outing confirmed something even more\
  \ important?  The undeniable truth of abundant Irish hospitality and mythology,\
  \ along with a spirit of rebellion.  And maybe without this Irish cultural legacy\
  \ that was transformed through mass settlement to colonial-era Australia, the legend\
  \ of Ned Kelly, and Australian \u2018larrikinism\u2019 might never have been born?"
