Text: "A lot of people will tell me that at my age, I have so much I don\u2019t know\
  \ about the world, and so much I have yet to experience. Yet, what they don\u2019\
  t know is that I\u2019ve had to undergo an extreme change in my life that many people\
  \ don\u2019t get a chance to experience, even in their adult life. I had to uproot\
  \ my entire life, and move half way across the world. I had to completely alter\
  \ my way of living. I had to leap into the unknown. \n\nFor the majority of my childhood,\
  \ I was living in egypt. I went to school, I was surrounded by family and friends,\
  \ and most of all, I was familiar. However, when I was 11 years old, the Egyptian\
  \ Revolution started. It was no longer safe for me or my family to live in Egypt.\
  \ My sister and I couldn\u2019t go to school, because the bus would be stopped.\
  \ We couldn\u2019t go out of the house past eight, because we would hear gunshots\
  \ throughout the night. My mother decided that the best option for us was to move\
  \ to Canada. Normally, people assume everyone wants to move to Canada. I mean, why\
  \ wouldn\u2019t you? It\u2019s safe, it\u2019s economically prosperous, and it\u2019\
  s just. However, for me, I was terrified. What I had known my whole life was about\
  \ to come to an end. \n\nWhen my family and I arrived in Canada, the adjustment\
  \ was difficult. I was a very traditional, Muslim girl, who was suddenly exposed\
  \ to a very open, Westernized society. I was terrified of not being able to fit\
  \ in. Not only was my religion now the minority, I also wasn\u2019t extremely proficient\
  \ in english. This made it hard for me to make friends, as no one could really relate\
  \ to me or my experiences. I was uncomfortable, and I was uncertain of what the\
  \ future would hold for me and my family. \n\nOver the years, the fear I originally\
  \ had, has been replaced with an immense amount of appreciation. My perspective\
  \ of the world was significantly broadened in so many different ways. Back in Egypt,\
  \ the majority of people I was surrounded by were Arabic. Now that I\u2019ve moved,\
  \ I\u2019ve met so many different people, and all from diverse backgrounds. I\u2019\
  ve learned to be more open minded towards new things, and I\u2019ve had the freedom\
  \ to explore the type of person I want to me. However, the biggest thing my moving\
  \ to Canada has given me is my Canadian citizenship. My travelling and moving to\
  \ Canada has allowed me to obtain the privilege of being able to further explore\
  \ other parts of the world. I\u2019m finally able to go places I\u2019ve never been\
  \ able to.\n\nTravelling, and moving to new places, is something that often accompanies\
  \ the term \u201Cunknown.\u201D For many people, the unknown can be scary. It\u2019\
  s hard to go into a new situation when you aren\u2019t sure what to expect. Nonetheless,\
  \ the unknown can also bring about unexpected positive experiences. For me, the\
  \ chance to go to Portugal would be an unknown positive experience. My travelling\
  \ experiences, and ultimately, my moving to Canada, has shown me that the unknown\
  \ doesn\u2019t have to me scary; it can be beautiful."
