Text: "The first sign of frostbite is a stinging or burning sensation and as I flex\
  \ my fingers, I can feel that bone-deep chill already settling into my joints, stiffening\
  \ and numbing. Worn weary of icy gusts of wind, bodies are huddled together, shoulders\
  \ hunched inwards, and frozen lashes sweep over chapped cheeks while we stand, waiting\
  \ and watching. Glacier calving is not for the impatient, and Alaska does not present\
  \ a particularly welcoming climate, yet here we stand, eyes trained on the hulk\
  \ of ice that will slowly but surely carve itself away from a glacier before dropping\
  \ into the ocean. \n\nThe temptation to escape into the warmth that beckons from\
  \ the inner deck of the yacht we stand on is great, and lots have left already,\
  \ the chill in the air driving them towards the heat. Lips blue, fingers pink, we\
  \ all stand, shivering as we exchange stories, bonding over the shared lack of warmth\
  \ and I know without a doubt that freezing extremities are worth it to experience\
  \ this. The cruise is short, a day trip out on the water and already I\u2019ve seen\
  \ things I\u2019d only dreamed about. Puffins dot the craggy shore of an island;\
  \ specks of orange feet shining against dark rock, orcas glide along under shimmering\
  \ water; making shadows that we can just see as we lean over cool railings, the\
  \ excitement warming us long enough to want to stay to catch a sight of them. The\
  \ conversation is light, easy, and between sip of piping hot coffee and tea, our\
  \ captain regales us with tales of his boyhood spent amongst the same islands. The\
  \ cold should be enough of a deterrent to make us all want to escape but nobody\
  \ does, this is all worth it. \n\nI\u2019d landed in Alaska in Anchorage and made\
  \ a trip down towards Seward while driving down through Fairbanks, Denali, and a\
  \ little city called North Pole. The choice to venture away from sunny California\
  \ to Alaska had not been one greeted with complete understanding; after all, California\
  \ presents a constant oasis while Alaska brings to mind harsh, unpleasant climates.\
  \ Anchorage had presented the closest thing to a metropolis I\u2019d come to find\
  \ in Alaska and even then, the largest city, was dwarfed by the impressive mountains\
  \ that surround it. In the face of the splendour of nature, man-made marvels pale\
  \ almost instantly. \n\nSeverely underpopulated, Alaska presents itself as a sort\
  \ of paradise, all open fields and fresh air. The drive down to Fairbanks brings\
  \ with it miles and miles of land that stretches as far as the eye can see, the\
  \ horizon broken up with mountains, all extending beyond the reach of my vision.\
  \ For a city transplant, it truly was like stepping into a new world. \n\nWell-versed\
  \ in travelling the world, I\u2019d long since lost the wide-eyed wonder that accompanied\
  \ a trip to a new place\u2013after you\u2019ve seen so much of the same, reality\
  \ tends to blend into one monotonous landscape, but Alaska is new, and unlike any\
  \ other place I\u2019ve been. Even now, as we stand on the deck, blinking snow out\
  \ of our eyes, there are smiles on the ruddied faces that surround me. In the face\
  \ of adversity, these are people who thrive, they have learned to make themselves\
  \ a home where others cannot."
