Text: "day trip to Colaba was bound to be eye-opening, especially how mesmerized the\
  \ bestseller Shantaram had left me. Right in the heart of all the hustle and bustle,\
  \ my mission was simple- seek and you shall find. \nFirst stop: A must-have masala\
  \ chai and samosa breakfast filling me with an energy ready to rumble and roam the\
  \ lively streets without any idea of what the day will bring. Just go with the flow\
  \ and let go.\nNext stop: Spontaneously stumbling across a cheerful soul. As I warranted\
  \ my wandering eyes, mischievous mind and fearless feet to take me with the busy\
  \ beat and buzz that India had already heightened my chilled out ways with, I was\
  \ ready to explore. Strolling down the cobbled streets, a meditated state of walking\
  \ guided me into an ease that I had a feeling this day would be daring and delightful.\
  \ Before India, I never had the ability to shut off the outer world so well. \n\
  There she was. She caught my eye through her careful manner of enacting a daily\
  \ routine. Casually yet thoroughly brushing her teeth, the lady on the street swiftly\
  \ spat the remains of Colgate out down the drain to beam up at me with her freshly\
  \ scrubbed shiny smile. \u201CWhat country?\u201D (one of the most common questions\
  \ asked while in India) she grinned and joyfully added, \u201CCome here, welcome\
  \ to my home.\u201D Hanging on to every word I uttered, she ushered me into her\
  \ home \u2013 a tent on the side of the street.\nThe stinky smell of dogs instantly\
  \ hit me. The air was a stale stench of sweat and pets. Now I was bewildered by\
  \ her minty breath. She seemed so proud and pleased with her confined, claustrophobic\
  \ yet cosy space shared with her loved ones. Heaving with a pack of playful and\
  \ rather healthy looking dogs, she began to proudly introduce each one of the six\
  \ howling hounds. Saving her favourite to last, she enthusiastically exclaimed his\
  \ name, \u201CJohn\u201D and picked him up, brightly bidding me to take a photo.\
  \ I willingly whacked out my phone to capture such a curious moment that triggered\
  \ the thought only in India. Steadily, she looked at me, hurriedly, she engaged\
  \ with me, as if all we had was the present moment to make this adventure possible.\
  \ \nRose Heaven Francis. Also known as my friend and tour guide for the day. With\
  \ a spring in her step and fervor in her face, I obediently followed her footsteps\
  \ feeling calm and collected in her presence as she knew the streets like the back\
  \ of her hand. The devoted dog owner instantly became my pal, taking me under her\
  \ wings, flying me through the frenzy of lively Colaba. Moving between the frantic\
  \ flow of tuk tuks, cars, buses, bikes and trucks tantalized my senses and wavered\
  \ my stress. As we constantly headed towards traffic and tons of people roaming\
  \ the streets, I not once doubted Rose, due to our connection of trust that had\
  \ formed instantly from her welcoming words and friendly face. \nThe day consisted\
  \ of a cunningly quick and rhythmic fashion of sightseeing. From the most rapid\
  \ peek and purchase in a clothes shop to drifting in and out of the renowned Leopold\u2019\
  s caf\xE9. We meandered around at the progress of typical tourists making a mandatory\
  \ stop on the street for a ginger infused masala chai and chatter with other locals.\
  \ I would not have stumbled across this serendipitous spot if it weren't for dear\
  \ Rose by my side. We jollied around like locals popping into a supermarket leading\
  \ to a spirited caf\xE9 peopled by native street workers. We sat and sipped away\
  \ on an extra sugary sweet lime soda to stop and speak for a bit before taking the\
  \ boat to Elephanta Island. \nNo time for decisions. No time to think. No time for\
  \ time itself. Embracing special connections. Entertaining the present moment. Living\
  \ life."
