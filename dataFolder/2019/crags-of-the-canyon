Text: "\"Keely we have a spot open for the Fish River Canyon hike, you're my only\
  \ friend spontaneous enough I could ask a week before. Will you come?\" \n\"Anya,\
  \ the what hike? Sure I'll be there.\" And just like that my next exploration was\
  \ planned. From the sophistication of London to the wild bed of Nam.\n\nThe group\
  \ consisted of an array of expertise; accountants, scientists, a petite dancer,\
  \ a handful of geologists and myself, a soul still reeling from family loss and\
  \ heartache.  Most of them where strangers to me, but in the intimate silence of\
  \ nature we all connected with each other and along the six days of trekking our\
  \ steps became one. \n\nThe beginning of the trail is a viewing point for non hikers,\
  \ where we were told, if we think we can't handle the rough terrain and ruggedness\
  \ of dry Namibia we should turn back now.  The pirate in me grinned and the cutlass\
  \ of stubbornness glinted in the light of challenge.  \nOne by one, we began the\
  \ decent into the arid rockiness of the canyon.  The tinking of pots, a siren sound,\
  \ lulling us down into the unknown.    \n\nThe vastness and expanse rose above us\
  \ as we reached the floor base of the wrinkled crags.  With the river by our side,\
  \ we made camp, the stars our cover and shadows our time.  A bunch of us girls found\
  \ a large rock to bathe behind and as the cool murky green water washed away sweaty\
  \ sand scars our vulnerabilities were exposed as well.  This rawness and untainted\
  \ beauty encouraged us to be real with each other.  Finding a bathing rock every\
  \ morning became a ritual, we complained about chaffing and told of heartbreak.\
  \  I felt life's urban complexities crumble, and sprouting from the cracks was my\
  \ new form, healing and wanting wholeness.  These quiet moments of harmony are golden\
  \ memories. \n\nAs I rhythmically marched each day through Biblical imagery, strength\
  \ exuded from the ancient mountains, I listened to the womb like silence and heard\
  \ the mystical stories mother nature so willingly told.   One of her teachings was\
  \ that of simplicity.  All that I relied on, I carried on my back, (even though\
  \ I snuck some delicious Thai pesto into my pack.)  Sticks collected as we walked\
  \ burned and crackled into the night, a flask of whiskey was passed around and stories\
  \ of wisdom and stupidity made us laugh while the aged walls of majesty observed\
  \ with knowing. \n\nThroughout the days my scrunched eyes devoured the tones and\
  \ textures, smells and remnants of those passed before us.  I felt like a solitary\
  \ Martian against the rich red soil, looking out into the zaffre blue atmosphere.\
  \  Minute grains of sand caused the most intense discomfit in dusty hiking boots,\
  \ but digging a hip hole in that same sand allowed for a restful nights sleep. \
  \ Or how the putrid stench of the sulphur springs did not stop us from wallowing\
  \ in the skin searing water.  Lone horses were evidence of wars fought, and a graveyard\
  \ of discarded hiking equipment lay by the wayside as I trudged passed a milestone.\
  \ \n\nA great monolith proclaimed the last stretch before civilisation.  Our steps\
  \ slowed unanimously, wanting it all to last just a bit longer...\n\nThe essence\
  \ of this spontaneous trip, sharing an orange segment, the salve that nature is,\
  \ simple living, and real human connection are codes I have returned to when the\
  \ din crescendos.   I tell anyone who listens that the humble act of walking between\
  \ the faces of the Fish River canyon will tune your soul to contentedness and exhaust\
  \ your worries until they can no longer cling to your being. \n\nLeaping with abandon\
  \ into the unknown is my spirit, it is the energy that nomads consume, the tingle\
  \ of fear that keeps a traveler alert and wanting.  It is the courage I face the\
  \ average day with and the lessons of life I try to absorb.  It is giving that first\
  \ smile to a stranger and challenging  your heart to compassion even when it is\
  \ broken.  It is brave, it is kind.  The unknown is my constant journeying companion\
  \ and I will gladly go where it leads."
