Text: "Heavy eyes squint against the light. Inside out or back to front? Argh, if\
  \ only countless tumbles hadn't faded the tag. Sleepy fingers fumble at the zip.\
  \ Once, twice, almost there....brute force gets the result. Left, right, right,\
  \ left, who knew socks could be so picky. Stomp, stomp...squeeze. Lace up. How is\
  \ it possible to be late so early, 7.30am and already half an hour behind schedule?\n\
  \ \nLights, camera, action; literally, torch on, camera in bag and out the door.\
  \ Early morning dreariness is shocked by early morning cold. Actually, May in Patagonia\
  \ is almost always cold. But on this particular morning the air is definitively\
  \ crisp, with a white layer carpeting the dimly lit lanes of a small Argentine village\
  \ still firmly asleep. Ever the adventurer in my soul, the loafing finger that looms\
  \ over the snooze button was cast aside, in the allure of a sunrise like no other.\
  \ \n \nCoral skies reflected in the steel blue waters of a glacial lake cast amongst\
  \ granite peaks. The bravest of the sun\u2019s rays creeping past the jagged edges\
  \ of rock to warm my face and bask my lens in a light of mountain glory. Images\
  \ that outweighed the easy comfort of a plush duvet and a ticking oil heater as\
  \ snooze repeats itself. Images that made every step out of the dimly lit lanes\
  \ into the dark snowscape seem worth it. \n\nHalf bends and hillocks faded the foggy\
  \ blur of streetlights and everything looked as one. So too, did they fade the relative\
  \ feeling of safety and warmth that comes with civilisation. It was hard to resist\
  \ the feeling of being a character on the wrong side of an ill-fated plot line.\
  \ Like Hansel and Gretel stumbling upon the witch\u2019s house, you want to shout\
  \ out, warn the character to turn-around, run, it\u2019s obviously a trap! \n\n\
  Nonsense, that\u2019s the stuff of stories and make-believe. Soon the sun will rise,\
  \ and any inkling of fear will be but a melted footprint in the trail. Footprint.\
  \ Footprint that looks doubtfully human and positively puma. Oh, that\u2019s a paw\
  \ print, a beautifully pressed trail of paw prints that look alarmingly fresh. No\
  \ one mentioned puma\u2019s when coral skies and glacial lakes were the topic of\
  \ conversation. No one mentioned puma\u2019s full stop. Recalling what one might\
  \ do if faced by a puma, all that came to mind was what one might do when faced\
  \ by a bear; make loud noises. Bears and Pumas don\u2019t seem too dissimilar, both\
  \ may potentially see me as food. Gingerly, I started singing as cheerful a version\
  \ of Manana by The Muppets as possible. Wouldn\u2019t want to alert the puma to\
  \ any of my concerns through a panicked rendition. \n\nSeveral do-do-do-do-do\u2019\
  s through and the prints veer off the track. It\u2019s amazing how much distance\
  \ one covers when slightly scared, dare I say it. A sign for the lake shows only\
  \ one kilometre left. Dark shadows have now turned to mid-tone greys, and tall silhouettes\
  \ reveal themselves as snow laden branches. A heavy white fog sits low through the\
  \ valley and doesn\u2019t inspire the kind of thoughts that dragged me out of bed.\
  \ Had it crossed my mind that my glorious, glacial, mountain sunrise may not come\
  \ to fruition\u2026briefly, the closer my steps took me to the lake, more so.  \n\
  \nLaguna Torre, there she sat. A beautiful lake, void of any colour or reflection.\
  \ Coral skies and granite peaks, vivid contrasts and grandiose rays of light all\
  \ stayed in bed this morning, clearly opting for the snooze. The feeling you get\
  \ when you\u2019re expecting a new bike for Christmas, yet you unwrap socks instead.\
  \ I sat, bleakly staring at the lake as it stared bleakly back at me, in disbelief\
  \ for a while, maybe even denial. \n\nThen it dawned on me, unlike the sun tucked\
  \ above the fog. All the effort; early rising, bearing the cold and singing songs\
  \ to ward off pumas, combined with the icy white of the lake and the snow-hunched\
  \ tree limbs that lined its shores, created a whole new kind of beauty. It wasn\u2019\
  t what I expected to find, but I found beauty and achievement in those socks that\
  \ rivalled any new bike."
