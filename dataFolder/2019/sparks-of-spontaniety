Text: "\"Sorry ma'am, but the bed has been double booked and there really isn't anything\
  \ I can do right now but refund you.\"\n\nI was exploring England, and London was\
  \ my last stop. I was exhilarated. Everything had been going smoothly...until this\
  \ moment. It was my first solo trip and there was simply no room for error. So,\
  \ I planned all the particulars thoroughly and constructed an itinerary, detailed\
  \ down to the minute. But receiving the news that the hostel I carefully selected\
  \ to be my London home will not be able to accomodate me, I started feeling those\
  \ minutes slip away with every impatient tap of my foot.\n\nI called the one friend\
  \ I had in the city, asking her to help me find affordable accomodation in record\
  \ timing so I don't have to forfeit any more of my plans for the day. She wouldn\u2019\
  t let finish my sentence before she invited me over, saying she had to go out of\
  \ town the next day but I was welcomed to crash for the night. Desperate, I took\
  \ her up on it despite being skeptical about how close her apartment will be to\
  \ the places I planned to visit. \n\nShe offered to show me around, so I gave her\
  \ my schedule. She took one look at it, threw it on the bed and declared: \"we'll\
  \ walk across the Westminster Bridge, so you can be all touristy, take pictures\
  \ under the Big Ben, then I'm taking you to the Winter Wonderland!\" I wondered\
  \ if an amusement park was worth sacrificing the museums I planned to see that night\
  \ for, and until this day I can't tell what stopped me from voicing my reluctance,\
  \ but I am glad I didn't. \n\nThe Winter Wonderland was not an attraction, it was\
  \ an experience. Its kaleidoscopic lights radiated a rejuvenating aura of joy and\
  \ suddenly, I was ten again. Every five steps smelled of a different delicacy, and\
  \ we tried as many of them as we could stomach. The adrenaline rush from the rides\
  \ whose safety seemed questionable, coupled with the breathtaking view of the city\
  \ from the ferris wheel, made me admit that I would've been missing out on a lot\
  \ had I stuck to my schedule. \n\nThe next night I slept in a hostel that I stumbled\
  \ upon while wandering around Westminster. At breakfast, I met an Argentinian lady\
  \ with whom I instantly connected. I showed her my itinerary for the day, and after\
  \ a whole minute of examining it she looks up, confounded: \"how are you not visiting\
  \ Buckingham Palace today, the Changing of the Guard is happening today!\" She walked\
  \ me through the historical significance of the ceremony and insisted I accompany\
  \ her, and for the second time this trip, I found myself going off-schedule. \n\n\
  Witnessing the ceremony was as close as I'll probably ever come to time travel.\
  \ The palace's unparalleled neoclassical architecture, the royal melodies filling\
  \ the air and the perfectly harmonious motion of the guards worked together to immerse\
  \ my sense in beauty. In this moment of surreality, I could've sworn I was at an\
  \ ancient coronation ceremony or royal wedding. Once again, non-adherence to my\
  \ rigid schedule left me grateful. \n\nTwo beds, two showers, two people, two places\
  \ and two visits; all whom I never intended to have as a part of my trip, but have\
  \ somehow left one very grateful me. \n\nIt was through this trip that I learned\
  \ the power of spontaneity. I always found refuge in researching for my travel,\
  \ strategically planning then researching some more. And while that\u2019s extremely\
  \ useful, this trip taught me to always leave room for spontaneous activities, for\
  \ things not going right and for enjoying opportunities as they arise, and that\
  \ this will elevate my travel experiences.\n\nThe two experiences I did not plan,\
  \ turned out to be my favourite parts of the trip. Every time I remember that, I\
  \ am grateful to the feeling in my gut that forbade me from saying no. Be it my\
  \ inner child or my explorer, it helped me see the beautiful London through different\
  \ people's eyes and perspectives and enjoy experiences that will forever remain\
  \ vivid in my memory."
