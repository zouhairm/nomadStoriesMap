Text: "We thought we had devised a clever plan. Instead of taking a train for 19 hours\
  \ from New Delhi to Siliguri, we would hop on a short flight to Bihar and board\
  \ the train there, cutting the time in half. But just like the ocean does, India\
  \ would sweep us upside down and plant us somewhere new. \n\nWhen we landed in Bihar,\
  \ there was a large sign informing us that if we were in possession of alcohol,\
  \ we would be arrested and that it was illegal to drink or possess any alcohol in\
  \ the entire state. \n\nAs we stepped outside, the taxi drivers descended on us\
  \ shouting \"Bodhgaya!\" They had sized me up correctly, a white western woman travelling\
  \ to Patna. If I hadn't been on a mission, Bodhgaya would have been one of my \"\
  must see\" places.\n\nWhen I said \"Train station\" they all stopped, turned, and\
  \ pointed to one driver. \"Come, come\" he gestured and we got into his full sized\
  \ white Range Rover. It was an astoundingly big car next to the motorcycles and\
  \ tuk-tuks on the road. On the ride to the station, past a roundabout filled with\
  \ cars, tuk-tuks, dogs, and people, there was an open market under the train tracks\
  \ and people were cooking meat on dark old pieces of metal over coals. \n\nThe shops\
  \ on the sides of the street gave way to blue plastic tarps. When I looked closely,\
  \ I could see that these were makeshift dwellings made with sticks and tarps- and\
  \ looking down the alleys, they seemed to go on forever. I had never been in the\
  \ middle of such poverty before, and at the railway station, my son and I succumbed\
  \ to confusion. The train schedules and the sign above the long line were all in\
  \ Hindi, dirty toddlers were sleeping on the floor. We were hungry, jet-lagged,\
  \ tired, and completely disoriented. \n\nIn a complete traveler failure, we went\
  \ back to the airport and bought a same-day ticket out of there. The culture shock,\
  \ the uncertainty, it was all too much. We decided that we just wanted to go to\
  \ Jaipur and drink gin and tonics. \n\nIn Jaipur, through Airbnb, we landed in a\
  \ lovely and amazingly plush 3 star hotel. On the fourth night, in the early evening,\
  \ there was a sudden urgent drumbeat outside. We couldn't stop ourselves from going\
  \ outside. There were drummers on the front porch of the hotel, preparing for a\
  \ wedding. We introduced ourselves and one of them named \"Lucky\" said that his\
  \ father had been a puppeteer and was now running a music school.\n\nWe hadn't heard\
  \ any live music in India besides those drums. \"I live in a slum. You should come\
  \ to my dad's music school\" Lucky told us. It seemed magical that Lucky had turned\
  \ up out of the blue, even lucky. \n\nWhen we sized him up, he seemed okay. I really\
  \ doubted that he lived under a plastic tarp, but I didn't know. We told him we\
  \ would visit but didn't really make up our minds until the next day when he buzzed\
  \ us on what'sapp. \"Are you ready?\" he asked. \"On our way down.\" I replied.\
  \ \n\nThe monsoon had left us sparkling clean streets and fresh air that made the\
  \ city even more beautiful.  We passed a huge white obelisk on the way to \"the\
  \ slum\". We had no idea where we were going and when he got out, we followed him,\
  \ joking but definitely nervous, down the path into a maze of earth-walled buildings,\
  \ none of which had doors. People were cooking, children were playing, it was not\
  \ intimidating at all. \n\nAs we sat on the balcony outside of the 2 rooms where\
  \ Lucky lived with his father, brother and wives, I took a deep breath of relief.\
  \ We all sang \"Kuch Kuch Hota Hai\" together even though I don't understand the\
  \ words. They offered us daal for lunch and we communicated as best we could. After\
  \ lunch, everyone took out their smartphones so we figured it was time to excuse\
  \ ourselves. \n\nOur clever plan was abandoned but the true magic of travel is the\
  \ unexpected connections and common humanity. That, we accomplished."
