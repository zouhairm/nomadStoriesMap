Text: "The trip happened in 2016, and it was the first time I took my mom for a trip\
  \ outside my home country, Indonesia.  We went to Bangkok - Thailand, for 3 days\
  \ and 2 nights from 20 - 22 March 2016.  I bought a voucher of a one day trip and\
  \ an accommodation for 3 days and 2 nights about IDR 1,500,000 or around US$ 120\
  \ for 2 person. That is cheap right? \n\nAfter I bought the voucher, I started to\
  \ hunt for the ticket. And I got the ticket for the said dates which cost around\
  \ IDR 4,000,000 or US$ 310 for two person. Our itinerary was; Day 1 - Upon arrival,\
  \ we will be picked up by the local guide and transferred directly to the hotel.\
  \ Day 2 - We will be picked up at 8am and will start the city tour and visited the\
  \ Honey shop, jewelry shop and Wat Arun. Day 3 - We will be picked up at the hotel\
  \ and transferred directly to the airport.  \n\nWe arrived on our first day at 1\
  \ pm, the local guide had waited us at the gate. And it was not only us, there were\
  \ few guests that also using the same company. Since there was still a time for\
  \ us to explored the city, so we decided to go for an adventure. When we were in\
  \ Bangkok, we lived in Ramkhamhaeng Street where there are malls and food street\
  \ nearby. So, during our trip, we used the bus to go here and there except for 1\
  \ day that we got a free city tour. We took the bus just in front of our hotel,\
  \ there were two types of buses. The one that is free, and the one that paid. And,\
  \ we experienced both buses on our first day in Bangkok.\n\nIt was fun, and I did\
  \ not expect my mom would be strong enough for the adventure. Considering that it\
  \ was her first time doing an independent trip, walking in the pedestrian, went\
  \ up and down to the pedestrian bridge, waiting for the bus and running to catch\
  \ the bus. She was already 67 years old by that time.\n\nOn our last day, since\
  \ we took last flight from Bangkok, we went to Madame Tussaud in the morning. For\
  \ sure, we had another bus trip plus a taxi to get there. Mom looked very happy\
  \ when we were there. she explored and took picture with all the statues there.\
  \ Before we entered Madame Tussaud, we tried the coffee and snacks that is sell\
  \ by the food seller in front of the mall where the museum at.\n\nIt was a great\
  \ experienced I had with mom, just the two of us. And I was happy to see how excited\
  \ mom was during the trip. She really enjoyed the walking, the bus chasing, the\
  \ waiting, never complained. And, it gave me courage to take her to another trip\
  \ which is happened in 2018 for a longer day trip and a packed itinerary."
