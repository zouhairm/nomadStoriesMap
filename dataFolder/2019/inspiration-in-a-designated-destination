Text: "Bali \u2013 probably as far away from a secret escape as it can get. Ubud,\
  \ a city where digital nomads strive and tourism reached its peak, is probably one\
  \ of the easiest destinations to start traveling. In the middle of my first long\
  \ trip (about two months in total) I stranded there. I only planned to stay there\
  \ for a couple of days and then move on to Java, but things seldom go as anticipated.\
  \ \nYou could probably call it a self-finding trip and the desire to just get away\
  \ and figure my life out, when I decided to visit south-east Asia and booked my\
  \ flight about two weeks in advance. I had no idea what was coming for me, read\
  \ the lonely planet in the plane and only packed the most necessary. \nAn amazing\
  \ part of our earth, way to beautiful and diverse to cover in a single article.\
  \ However, after a couple of strolls through the narrow and labyrinthine alleys,\
  \ I fell in love with this cozy place. Maybe it was because of the season, but there\
  \ weren\u2019t too many tourists, the hostels were clean, the homestays luxurious,\
  \ the food \u2013 from burgers to traditional Balinese dishes (my mouth still soaks\
  \ when I think about the tempura) was delicious and most impressive for me, were\
  \ all the stores which sold their traditional crafted \u201Cgifts\u201D. They were\
  \ neither simple, nor cheesy. But the result of hard work executed by experts. Chess\
  \ sets were every figure is hand carved. Sculptures, life sized animals and miniature\
  \ gods. Instruments, beautiful in shape and sound. Hand crafted Steel drums, guitars,\
  \ whistles and pipes. You name it. It was there and made with love and expertise,\
  \ which can hardly be found in western cultures anymore. \nOn one of my walks I\
  \ discovered a small shop, nothing more then a bamboo meadow, a couple of neatly\
  \ organized tools and a wall with wooden masks. On the floor of the four square-meter\
  \ shop, sat a man, probably in his forties, carving. After a short conversation\
  \ we had decided, that I could come and learn from him. The next day I arrived to\
  \ work my way through a solid block of hibiscus. Never in my life, was I so absorbed.\
  \ \n\u201CYou know, life is quite simple around here\u201D, he told me one afternoon.\
  \ \u201CEvery day I come here to work with my hands.\u201D When watching him, it\
  \ was obvious how much he cared for his craft. The way he touched a raw piece of\
  \ wood, the precision and the dedication put in every single stroke of his hammer.\
  \ When he cut through the material, it was neither brutal nor arbitrary. Each time\
  \ he laid his hands on his tools, they followed his intention. He had a sculpture\
  \ carved in his mind and the hibiscus followed. Beauty and order emerged from a\
  \ seemingly chaotic good. \nI guess I don\u2019t have to pretend, that I was even\
  \ close to his degree \u2013 wood splintered, when I tried to cut through it, making\
  \ it necessary to redesign the whole project. My fingers were cut countless times\
  \ \u2013 even the soles of my feet, fixing the piece with them in a somewhat half-lotus\
  \ position. He just sat there smiling. \u201CIt\u2019ll pass. It happened to all\
  \ of us, when we started. Perfection is only accomplished by repetition.\u201D \n\
  Sometimes he would ask me about my life, back home. I would start to get a little\
  \ uncomfortable, knowing, solely the flight must have been an unimaginable high\
  \ amount for him. He would probably work every day for the rest of his life and\
  \ might never get the opportunity to travel the world. \u201CYou know, I don\u2019\
  t have to fly across the ocean to see beauty. I open my eyes and see something new\
  \ every day. I can work whenever I want and do what I love. I really like to hear\
  \ stories about other places, and on some days, I wish I could see them. But then\
  \ I remember, I don\u2019t have to search for another life. It\u2019s always where\
  \ I am, and I\u2019m quite happy about that.\u201D\nOnly much later, did I realize,\
  \ what he was saying to me at that time."
