Text: "The most unexpected thing I can find in a road trip are the mistakes. I know\
  \ they are a constant in life but, still, they surprise me every time. From that\
  \ perspective, our road trip was very unexpected, specially for Marissa.\nThe adventure\
  \ began when we were in Edinburgh. Ricardo signed a contract to rent a car, and\
  \ one morning we were all seated in it, ready for fun.\nHe crowned himself the driver,\
  \ and after celebrating his negotiation skills,  proclaiming he had done it very\
  \ well, he turned on the car. After forty kilometers of collective screaming, he\
  \ mastered the technique to drive in a country where left is right in traffic matters.\
  \ And that\u2019s it! We were going to Loch Ness to visit Nessie, the Scotttish\
  \ monster of world renown.\nIn the passenger front seat of the car we can see Marissa.\
  \ She understand maps and is great at being bossy and directing the driver in a\
  \ really annoying voice (I am very happy to announce that after seven hours with\
  \ Marissa as a co-driver, Ricardo didn\u2019t commit any murders).\nAs we were losing\
  \ the sight of the cities, the landscape was getting more green, blue and gray,\
  \ with mountains, trees and stones. When we finally arrived, the sky had taken a\
  \ silver greyish color; the air was pure, cold and vigorous. The colossal mountains\
  \ and the endless lake transmitted infinity to me. Were these sights worth risking\
  \ Ricardo\u2019 mental health? Yes, totally.\nTo celebrate the unhospitable monster,\
  \ we toasted with a delicious honey whisky made in a distillery\u2026 in Skye island.\
  \ We got our feet wet, we laughed, we were happy, we were back in the car. \nAfter\
  \ that, Ricardo drove us to a nice green hotel. Marissa had booked a shared room\
  \ there for the six of us, so we went inside the building to check in and try the\
  \ beds. A nice lady was working on her laptop behind the counter. \n-\tCan I help\
  \ you?\n-\tHi, good night, I booked six beds in a shared room for tonight.\n-\t\
  Ok, give me your confirmation number.\n\nA long, anxious wait ensued.\n\n-\tSo,\
  \ you didn\u2019t book for today. Your reservations is for tomorrow.\n\n(Gulp.)\n\
  \n-\t\u2026could you tell me please of another place to sleep? \n-\tI don\u2019\
  t think so\u2026 Everything here will probably be booked because there\u2019s a\
  \ very popular dance festival in the city. It won\u2019t be quiet tonight! And \
  \ you chose to come the day of the event and didn\u2019t even book tickets!\n-\t\
  Thanks\u2026\n \nWe were relaxed. We owned a phone application called Booking. With\
  \ this, we could track a cheap room, book it and find it. We were powerful. Four\
  \ hours and six dead phones later, we had learnt that Booking can offer you rooms\
  \ that are not actually  available, many times. We also learnt that Scottish hostellers\
  \ don\u2019t feel very receptive at certain hours.\nWe finally found a place to\
  \ stay the night, and fell asleep very soon after the tour. Meanwhile, Ricardo was\
  \ in his bed plotting to get to Saint Andrew\u2019s golf court, the oldest one in\
  \ the world, to play some holes. He had brought his own golf clubs to Scotland,\
  \ casually. When I woke up early in the morning. I was not the first one up in the\
  \ room, Ricardo was dressing himself, singing, and commenting on his evil plans\
  \ out loud, like a cartoon villain.\n \n-\tI am a genius! I am a genius! Oh yeah!\
  \ I have the key! I will go to Saint Andrew\u2019s golf court, play some holes,\
  \ come back, and nobody will notice! I am so clever!\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why\
  \ we didn\u2019t include the beloved golf court in the tight schedule and the reason\
  \ is called a four hour deviation. And yes, we would notice. \nI decided to disappear\
  \ in order to avoid the inevitable \u201Cwhere\u2019s the car\u201D scream, and\
  \ come back to Edinburgh by train.\nI split from the group and that was that, I\
  \ don\u2019t know what happened after I left. I hope Ricardo  materialized his crazy\
  \ plans."
