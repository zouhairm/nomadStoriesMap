Text: "The past few years have felt as if deja vu has held me captive. With the same\
  \ day repeating over and over, the same words seemed to be pouring out of my mouth.\n\
  \nLife had become boring, with the same sunrise and sunset on the horizon every\
  \ morning, every night. \n\nI would spend hours looking at flight tickets to anywhere\
  \ away from here, reading articles titled along the lines of \u201C30 places to\
  \ visit before you\u2019re 30\u201D or \u201CBest Places of 2017\u201D.   Trying\
  \ to find something more than what I was doing everyday. \n\nAt the blooming age\
  \ of nineteen I\u2019m in my prime for adventure.  Maybe from jumping out of planes,\
  \ to scaling giant mountains just for the thrill, it\u2019s time for a leap into\
  \ a world unknown. \n\nEven though it\u2019s in the same country I\u2019ve been\
  \ in my whole life, the United States has some incredible sights that go completely\
  \ unrecognized.  For example, The Great Smokey Mountains locates in Tennessse. \n\
  \nI jumped in the car with my best friend one day, we filled our gas tank and just\
  \ drove. We ended up in Gatlinburg, Tennessee just a couple of hours later. It was\
  \ a breath of fresh air that we had both been craving. It was something different\
  \ from the dragging days we had come from. \n\nVenturing around the bustiling mountain\
  \ town is such a thrilling experience. From seeing the fog coving the tree covered\
  \ peaks of the Smokies, to the fun downtown vibes. There is never a dull time.\n\
  \nNow, Gatlinburg has become a tourist town to say the least, with gimicky shops\
  \ lining the streets, exclusive restaurants that you hear about on television, and\
  \ silly children\u2019s exhibits that cost way too much money for the experience\
  \ you\u2019re getting.  Although this is true, there are some hidden gems in this\
  \ busy place. \n\nMy friend and I had just had lunch at some exclusive to Gatlinburg\
  \ restaurant.  We were looking for soemthing interesting to do. When we looked up\
  \ to the mountain tops to see a ski lift leading people up into the trees. \n\n\
  We both decided we wanted to know what was hidden up in the tree tops, so we found\
  \ the line to the attraction, paid our ticket prices and hopped on to this mysterious\
  \ ski lift. \n\nWhen we arrived to the top, both of our jaws dropped. The fog lifted\
  \ to reveal a small little town at the top of the mountain. It was breathtaking.\
  \ With bonfires blazing, sunflowers popping up around incredible wooded sculptures,\
  \ and the views the some people only dream of. It was something we will never forget.\
  \ \n\nWe spent hours up in the attraction. Running through the garden they had planted,\
  \ watching baby bears play freely as we crossed hanging bridges in the trees. As\
  \ the night came to an end, we sat at the edge of a mountain on rocking chairs breathing\
  \ in a good amount of that fresh mountain air. \n\nThis was more than a year ago,\
  \ but it will always be something I or my best friend will never forget. \n\nWe\
  \ took an adventure we both desperately needed.  We also found something we would\
  \ have never imagined seeing in our lifetimes. It really was the place of dreams.\n\
  \nMoral of the story here, find adventure around you. Even though I had been to\
  \ Gatlinburg many times before. I still got too experience something new, I got\
  \ to see something breathtaking, something new and exciting. \n\nThe world is filled\
  \ with so many hidden gems. Sometimes you just need to go out there and find them.\
  \ It\u2019s all part of the adventure! \n\nSometimes you really just have to open\
  \ your eyes to see what is around you. Or maybe sometimes you just have to look\
  \ up!"
