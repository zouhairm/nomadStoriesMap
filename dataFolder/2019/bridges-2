Text: "A few days later, I would have woken up and started walking, and noticed the\
  \ pain in my legs was gone. And I would have even missed it, like a man misses a\
  \ loyal dog walking by his side, all the way to the end of the world. But that was\
  \ not the day. On June the 1st, my legs were hurting like Hell, as I made it to\
  \ Puente la Reina. It was my third day on the Camino Franc\xE9s: Santiago was one\
  \ of many milestones yet to come. On that day, on the Alto del Perd\xF2n, \"Hill\
  \ of Forgiveness\", I\u2019d come across some statues of pilgrims and found a story\
  \ for each and every one of them - there were an old knight, a young knight, and\
  \ a girl trying to fulfill her father's wishes, and of course the Devil followed\
  \ them, just like he follows every pilgrim, offering water in exchange for their\
  \ soul. Later that day, as my backpack was off my shoulders and a bed was waiting\
  \ for me in the Albergue at Puente la Reina, I thought about it, and about that\
  \ Templar chapel hidden by the trees. A place of silence and solemn shadows, where\
  \ it is customary to enter and pray barefoot, as it is when crossing the bridge\
  \ out of Puente la Reina - and so I was going to do on the following day, before\
  \ leaving the town, early in the quietest of mornings. On the following day, I would\
  \ have arrived to the fair, high-walled Estella, laid by the river, and played guitar\
  \ for a parish and a few Korean guys. But on June the 1st I was not in Estella yet,\
  \ though when I think back, it feels like I was in every town, on every path, and\
  \ talking in every language at the same time, like it all happened in the same day.\
  \ And yet, my mind knows that it was on June the 1st, outside a small bar in Puente\
  \ la Reina (which means \"Queensbridge\" and is the crossroad of two ancient pilgrim\
  \ paths) as the afternoon was fading into the evening and I was eating a paella\
  \ because I earned it - that's where and when I met Micky from Connecticut. I overheard\
  \ him, telling his story to a woman: about how he met his son and neither of them\
  \ knew who the other one was. How his father would bring him along at the pub, and\
  \ his mother would hurt him and say she hated him, and how one day he found the\
  \ courage to tell her every fucking thing. He said he was a \"man of heart\", and\
  \ he was not ashamed to cry, and I thought about Odysseus the brave and cunning,\
  \ crying without shame for his homeland. Nine days later, I was telling Odysseus\u2019\
  \ tale to an Irish girl, and as I did, I thought about Mickey again. But that was\
  \ nine days later, I keep forgetting this. That evening, Micky turned to me, and\
  \ asked me what did I want to do with my life. Teach, I answered. Good, he replied,\
  \ the world's in need of good teachers. And so we were talking, and I can't say\
  \ why, but at a point I told him that every man is bound to become his father one\
  \ day, and that it is not a curse, but a burden. I told him I've never known my\
  \ grandfather, and yet I smile like he used to. We kept talking, about being a father\
  \ and being a son, and he asked and I answered, and he listened. He called me a\
  \ wise man, and an old soul, and said he felt like the young one there. I didn't\
  \ reply, because I knew he was wrong, and felt not like that at all. But it was\
  \ amazing to know that my words could touch the soul of another man like that, and\
  \ that his words could touch mine. I never met him again on the Camino, but a bridge\
  \ had been built between the two of us, if only for a brief moment, time enough\
  \ for a paella and a few wise words. And I will never forget him."
