Text: "\u201CEsta cayendo un aguacero,\u201D I recited to myself and my empty car.\
  \  No, it wasn\u2019t a Harry Potter incantation or a family motto but the Spanish\
  \ equivalent of a well know English phase that I had looked up before I left a very\
  \ wet and windy North London in late April 2018.  I thought it was appropriate for\
  \ the inclement British April showers that I was experiencing on my departure day\
  \ but hopefully wouldn\u2019t be necessary for where I was heading, or not as the\
  \ case may be, as I was stuck in terrible Friday afternoon traffic on the M25. \
  \ The optimism and excitement I had garnered over the previous month at quitting\
  \ my job, packing up and renting out my flat and setting off on a new adventure\
  \ was very quickly dwindling as hour three of not going anywhere fast was ticking\
  \ around and I had not moved more than 20 miles from home.  Why, oh why had I decided\
  \ to go on a European road trip when I couldn\u2019t even escape the clutches of\
  \ the M25.  This false start and traffic jam fatigue also had me questioning other\
  \ things about my sabbatical.   Should I have just booked a flight and gone to S.E.\
  \ Asia?   Was a roof tent a wise idea for camping around Europe for a self-confession\
  \ non-camper?  Was I crazy for travelling alone with my car in Europe? Was this\
  \ shitty journey a bad omen for the rest of my trip?\n\nAs the rain dribbled down\
  \ my windscreen from the overhang on the roof tent, I sat there contemplating these\
  \ things and wondering whether I had everything I needed for a six-month sojourn\
  \ in Europe.  To pass the time I decided to run through an inventory check of the\
  \ contents of my car:\nPassport - tick! \nCredit card - tick! \nTravel insurance\
  \ \u2013 tick!\nHair products (vitally important for a naturally curly girl) \u2013\
  \ tick! \nCopious amounts of clothes that would probably never get worn \u2013 tick!\n\
  The kitchen sink \u2013 no tick, however I might as well have packed this as I had\
  \ just about all other kitchen equipment known to man. It dawned on me that I had\
  \ totally over-packed on all fronts.\n\nA time check for my ferry showed that it\
  \ was departing from Portsmouth for Santander on time at 17.00 and I was still stuck\
  \ nose to tail, crawling slowly around the M25.  As the clock edged ever nearer\
  \ to 16.00 I started to get a little panicky that I was going to miss the boat,\
  \ figuratively and possibly literally, so I decided to put on my road-trip playlist\
  \ to try and lift my mood.  Jackpot \u2013 first song on shuffle was my favourite\
  \ - Mr Brightside by The Killers.  And hey, it did put me on the bright side.  Whilst\
  \ singing at the top of my voice (I could because I was on my own) all my worries\
  \ suddenly disappeared and I realised that I was leaving the UK behind and setting\
  \ off on an adventure into the unknown.  The idea was to visit the unexplored Europe\
  \ that I hadn\u2019t covered on family and package holidays with my friends.  I\
  \ was sorted for the first three weeks (Spanish lessons in San Sebastian) but no\
  \ further plans after that.  I was free to do what I wanted, when I wanted, and\
  \ I decided there and then that there would be no more anxiety and I would embrace\
  \ all eventualities that came about on this trip.\n\nAt 15.30 I hit the M3 motorway\
  \ wending my way towards Portsmouth.  After putting my foot to the floor by 16.45\
  \ I was on the outskirts.  Would they let me on the boat if I got there in the next\
  \ 10 mins?  At 17.15, I was in an empty parking lot at the port with only a French\
  \ caravan for company.  I had missed the ferry and couldn\u2019t believe that I\
  \ had messed up so early on in my trip.  Now what?  After a quick dash into the\
  \ port office my fate was decided.  Rather than Hola Santander it was going to be\
  \ Bonjour St Malo.  This was not quite where I had intended to start but surely\
  \ this was all part of the adventure?"
