Text: "With heat so thick you feel the moisture as you breathe, dirt so red your nails\
  \ have been irrevocably stained and exhaustion so deep-seeded that it gets harder\
  \ and harder to find a reason to continue, outback Australia is not for the faint-hearted.\
  \ \n\nThe brutality of the experience either crushes or enlivens those who attempt\
  \ to conquer the vastness, sparseness and isolation that somehow co-exist simultaneously\
  \ with an intense lack of personal space.\n\nWithout a doubt, I was being crushed.\n\
  \nHaving made it to the dead center of the famous Red Center, escape seemed impossible.\
  \ Not possible to ditch the car and caravan here. Not possible to fly home. Not\
  \ possible to breathe as the anxiety creeps in and starts to take over. \n\nIn the\
  \ carpark by the thermal springs of Mataranka, I realize I\u2019ve been driving\
  \ with fists clenched, teeth gritted and eyes seeing only the endless road. I wasn\u2019\
  t living my pilgrimage across Australia, I was enduring it. \n\nA deep breath and\
  \ a stern bit of self-talk eject me from the ute. I slide into the hot springs,\
  \ creating a rusty plume of dirt in the water. When the dust has settled, all that\
  \ remains is blinding turquoise wrapping around me like silk.\n\nIt\u2019s a bizarre\
  \ melting pot of strangers.\n\nEvery half-naked bobbing traveller seems to be looking\
  \ at the other while thinking \u2018What\u2019s your story, eh? Didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to see someone like you out here!\u201D although nobody expected to see someone\
  \ like them out here either. Every status, age, ethnicity, gender and shape bob\
  \ along harmoniously. They may look different, but it\u2019s obvious they\u2019\
  re all out here for the same reason.\n\nEveryone there is yearning for simplicity.\
  \ \n\nEveryone there wears the same clothes every day. They go to bed with the stars\
  \ each night and rise with the sun every morning. Their day\u2019s goal is simply\
  \ to make it from Point A to Point B and to enjoy the scenery, the soundscape and\
  \ being lost in their thoughts (I like to think, dreams).\n\nNot being able to escape,\
  \ I remember now, was the whole point. A forced break from technology, modern convenience\
  \ and an unsustainable pace of life was supposed to open my eyes. \n\nI look around\
  \ and see myself reflected in smiles and nods of approval from complete strangers.\
  \ I lower my sunglasses to hide a tear as one says \u201CYou\u2019re brave! I could\
  \ never have done this at your age, especially not with two toddlers in tow. Best\
  \ of luck to ya! Oh and try the barra burger, it\u2019ll change ya life!\u201D\n\
  \nAnd so I happened upon the most necessary burger in Australia\u2026\n\nI know,\
  \ I know\u2026 \u2018necessary\u2019 probably isn\u2019t the adjective most commonly\
  \ used by food critics. But in my defense, the necessity of this burger had nothing\
  \ to do with the taste. \n\n\u2018Barra\u2019, that\u2019s Aussie slang for barramundi.\
  \ A notoriously evasive and spunky fish. Abundant, wild and native in the tropical\
  \ top end of Australia. It has white flesh and on this occasion was battered, fried\
  \ and golden with accompaniments so crisp that you taste them by the crunch in your\
  \ ears. Was there beetroot? Cheese? I don\u2019t even remember. The emotion of the\
  \ experience lingers long after the factual details have dissolved. \n\nI ate and\
  \ philosophized that actually, burgers are the perfect metaphor for life. For some,\
  \ it\u2019s about having the biggest, the fanciest and the most Instagrammable.\
  \ And then there are those of us who want the simple, because that\u2019s what makes\
  \ us happy. \n\nI did not expect to find myself having an emotional response to\
  \ a $9 burger by the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. But somehow it validated\
  \ the simple existence I craved. This burger was a reminder that having purpose\
  \ and meaning to chase the life that we want is necessary, and that journey starts\
  \ with knowing who we are. \n\nSometimes we lose our way and it\u2019s easy to forget\
  \ who we are, where we\u2019re going and why. This makes us feel vulnerable. But,\
  \ when vulnerability is on the loose, self-discovery is peaking. So don\u2019t shy\
  \ away, open your eyes, get your hands on a burger and go from there \u2013 it\u2019\
  s necessary!"
