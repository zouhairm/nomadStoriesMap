Text: Canada is one of the country where you can find different traditions and cultures.
  Canada is not made up by one community. It is the mixture of different communities
  which comes together to built happy and peace country. It is the most happiest country
  in the world. Canadian people are very humble and helpful. I saw smile on every
  face. Everyone follow the rules and regulations. I met with Canadian, Indians, Americans,
  Chinese, Pakistani, African etc. people.I really like the way they interact. They
  are very smart and intelligent. They told me about their cultures and traditions.
  We can also see Church, Temple, Gurudwara, Mosque etc. throughout the country. The
  weather is very enjoyable. we can see snow in winter whereas also enjoy summer weather.
  The best thing about Canada is there is no discrimination. That is the reason why
  people immigrate to Canada at faster rate. There are many famous places like CN
  Tower, Banff National Park, Niagara Fall, Ottawa's Parliament Hill, St. John's Signal
  Hill National Historic Site, Bay of Fundy, Victoria's Inner Harbour, Calgary Stampede
  and many more. These places are the attraction of tourists. Thousands of tourist
  come in every year to see the natural beauty of Canada. Everything is available
  in Canada. we can easily get international food. there are lots of restaurants,
  coffee shops, KFC, MacDonald and many more. I enjoyed every moment of stay in Canada.
  throughout my journey I really liked the Canada and its people.
