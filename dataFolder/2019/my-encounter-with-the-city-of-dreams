Text: "There is something magical about travel and by travel I do not mean that you\
  \ have to go someplace exotic or in the mountains, or have to lay on the beach .\
  \ Travel is magical even if it means just stepping out from your home and wander\
  \ into the city that you know or have been brought up in in or it can be your home\
  \ away from home which for me is every place on thus planet. \nHome away from home\
  \ . \nMumbai is something that I was always fascinated with as a child. After all\
  \ , it's called \" the city of dreams \" for a reason and as my instagram handle\
  \ @tjsinghdreamer states the reason clearly.\nThe first time I landed in Mumbai\
  \ and I stepped out of the aircraft and I took that first breath in , I could feel\
  \ it . I could feel this sense of belonging,  a sense of home , sense of infinite\
  \ possibilities. \nIt was almost as if I could breathe the dreams of thousands of\
  \ people who come to Mumbai every day in the hope to make it come true . I could\
  \ definitely feel mine coming true for sure. \nSo as I'm being driven by the uber\
  \ driver (which is literally everywhere in the world ) \nTo my hotel. I see the\
  \ buildings , the shops by the road , the people , the black and white taxis and\
  \ finally the sea. I can see the famous marine drive which is also called the Queens\
  \ necklace . Because of the shape of it . If you see it from the sky at night ,with\
  \ all the lights on it does look like a shiny necklace. The best part about mumbai\
  \ and not just mumbai but anywhere you go in the world , is the people.\nPeople\
  \ make any place magical and beautiful.\nTheir smile shows how they embrace everyone\
  \ and anyone who comes to their city and  they do believe that once you step in\
  \ Mumbai , you're from Mumbai and you become mumbai .\nEvery now and then , I keep\
  \ going to Mumbai for work from Delhi and everytime I'm there , I make sure I catch\
  \ the beautiful sunset by the sea at marine drive . \nIt's divine to see how the\
  \ sun just melt's into the sea ."
