Text: "If there is a place on Earth that you will wish to never leave, that is Puerto\
  \ Escondido. Blessed land with the best landscapes and weather to undertake the\
  \ greatest adventure. When I start classes at the university, I just wonder if what\
  \ I lived was a dream. All I want is to return to my home and surf a wave. At this\
  \ point is where everything starts. My two little sisters, mom, dad and me, suddenly\
  \ decided to travel from the city of Puebla, in Mexico, to Oaxaca de Ju\xE1rez.\
  \ A trip of four hours became in six when the tire of the bus struck; minutes before,\
  \ I had felt like a mini earthquake while everybody was asleep. That wasn't all,\
  \ an electric storm threatened, I was really afraid, I could only see the white\
  \ glowing skies when a thunder fell to the ground. \n\nWe arrived to the bus station\
  \ and walked at 4 AM across the streets of Oaxaca to get to the next station to\
  \ travel to Juquilita. Seven hours going through the unknowable, in the middle of\
  \ mountains and seeing the abyss under the hazardous curves. More than 800 Km separated\
  \ us from Puerto Escondido. I was really desperated, I only could ask how much time.\
  \ Two more hours! We finally arrived to Juquilita, we went down a narrow path full\
  \ of stalls that sold typical sweets and food of the region: natural tamarind with\
  \ chili, milk sweets, table chocolate, panela rolls, tlayudas, mole oaxaque\xF1\
  o... The only thing I could buy were little toasts of coroz, which reminded me of\
  \ my childhood when I used to live in Veracruz. After fourteen years later, I remembered\
  \ the taste of those moments. We all were running with our suitcases as if someone\
  \ were chasing us to get to Mass of 12 PM. I was really thirsty. \n\nThen, we went\
  \ to El Pedimento, place on the top of a hill full of fog, where all the faithful\
  \ can meditate, and build mud figures that reflect what we most desire to be granted.\
  \ The rain was approaching. Here we go! Only 3 hours and we''ll be feeling the air\
  \ uf success, the smell of the coast and observe \"mini tsunamis\". I was already\
  \ at home! We were asking for hotels, because when we called all were already reserved.\
  \ One hour to find our hotel, \"El Tuc\xE1n\". We left our luggage and went in search\
  \ of our first food after 24 hours of fasting. We ordered mineral orange drinks\
  \ and two tlayudas. Delicious! Beans, cheese, lettuce, tomato, avocado, tasajo and\
  \ sauce, on a typical blue corn tortilla. Before going back to the hotel I got lost,\
  \ but I found the road and no one knew. \n\nSecond day, we woke up at 6 AM, I was\
  \ still drowsy, but anxious to swim and challenge the sea. Run! The beach is free\
  \ for us. I took my swim board and swam two hundred meters away from the coast,\
  \ when I realized, I was a little afraid, my dad called me to come back. Funny!\
  \ If there were sharks, I would have returned, but there were only big waves to\
  \ play with. The whole day in Carrizalillo, a very small beach in a bay hidden from\
  \ aggressive tourism with the best landscape. That's the magic! When we went to\
  \ the hotel, I saw they sold popsicles of peanut, rice with milk, pistachio, banana,\
  \ coconut, lemon, tamarind, currant, melon and mango with chili. Simply the best\
  \ 100% natural ice lollies! \n\nThird day, we went to the Botanic Park, we did a\
  \ four-hour tour, when suddenly it seemed that the mountain would break. Did you\
  \ know that Oaxaca is a very seismic state? Fourth day, we admired the greatness\
  \ of the sea in Zicatela, and the surfers above more than 13 meters waves. Brilliant!\
  \ Amazement resulted in my first surf lesson in Carrizalillo; the tide increased\
  \ and it was perfect. I was focused on reaching the best wave. My instructor? A\
  \ 13 year old boy. When I was swimming toward the coast, a whirlpool captured me\
  \ for 15 seconds. The most extreme adventure! I felt alive."
