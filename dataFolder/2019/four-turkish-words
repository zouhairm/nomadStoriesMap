Text: "It was getting dark and our bikes were so covered in mud that the wheels could\
  \ barely spin. We had to stop pedaling a few hundred meters before. On our left\
  \ the Aegean Sea, the Greek island of Lesvos behind us. We were surrounded by centuries-old\
  \ olive trees. I wrote to our host for the night: \u201Cwe cannot make it for today,\
  \ sorry\u201D. \n \nWe had entered Turkey less than a week before and we were cycling\
  \ from Izmir to Istanbul, following the coastline. The November weather was still\
  \ warm, but rain had already become more frequent than in the previous months across\
  \ the Balkans and Greece. That morning we had started riding in Ayvalik on a secondary\
  \ road, close to the seaside; it was quiet and scenic, no cars, just sleepy stray\
  \ dogs. After a while, the tarmac gave way to a white road that soon became a clay\
  \ path. The rain of the last days had transformed the soil in the mud our bikes\
  \ got stuck in. Camping there could have been an option, but the morning after we\
  \ would have had the same challenge to face, so no: \u201Con we go!\u201D, we told\
  \ ourselves.  \n \nTired of pushing, we took off the panniers, carried them for\
  \ a few hundred meters, came back, got the rest, came back again for the bikes.\
  \ The map on my phone showed a block of buildings where the path ended, 200 meters\
  \ ahead. We had needed more than three hours for the last five kilometers. Our head\
  \ torches on, we kept going until we saw the first houses and when I put down the\
  \ bags in front of the gate of what looked like an empty summer residence, a dog\
  \ started barking. There were four or five rows of identical small houses, except\
  \ for an even smaller one just right of the entrance, from where a man came out.\
  \ He didn\u2019t speak English and my Turkish was just two words: \xE7ay (tea) and\
  \ bisiklet (bike). \n \nAfter him, two women came out and before we could explain\
  \ what happened, they took our bags and let us in. A few minutes later, the man\
  \ and I got out, he lighted a cigarette, gave one to me, we walked out in silence\
  \ to get the bikes and I was struggling to keep up with his fast pace. Back in the\
  \ house, Mery had already taken a shower and received new clean clothes. \u201C\
  I wanted to wait for the last panniers to get changed\u201D, she told me, \u201D\
  but I couldn\u2019t say no to the elder woman. She didn\u2019t speak a word of English\
  \ but she was very clear!\u201D. Our shoes had been cleaned and our clothes put\
  \ in the washing machine. \u201CTonight you stay here, you eat and rest and tomorrow\
  \ you go\u201D, they told us with a few English and Turkish words, lots of gestures\
  \ and the help of Google Translate.  \n \nWe sat down for tea, they served us food\
  \ and when our glasses were empty, they refilled them with tea, again and again.\
  \ They worked as guardians for the residence but the low season was really boring.\
  \ \u201CMy husband goes fishing calamari\u201D, Emine, the younger woman, told us,\
  \ \u201Cand I am here with nothing to do\u201D. The elder woman, Emine\u2019s husband\u2019\
  s mother, was watching Muslim prayers on the small TV close to the entrance. \u201C\
  You are guests sent by God\u201D, she told us with a big smile. During the night,\
  \ one of their friends joined us, with her 11 years-old boy. Emine called her because\
  \ she spoke some English. We answered many questions: about our bike trip, our jobs,\
  \ if we were married and had kids...  Chats and laughs went on and a bed was set\
  \ up for us in the entrance room. \n \nThe next morning, tea was first and breakfast\
  \ followed. Then they helped us to remove the mud from the bikes with a rubber hose\
  \ for gardening. When it was time to say goodbye, we took many pictures together\
  \ and the two new Turkish words we had learned were not enough, but we repeated\
  \ them again and again: te\u015Fekk\xFCr ederim. Thank you."
