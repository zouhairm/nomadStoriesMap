Text: "Two texts from my travel diary of 6 months in India. ( Original Texts are in\
  \ my original language: Portuguese )\n\n\nJaisalmer, desert, border with Pakistan,\
  \ a new moon in scorpion, November 2017\n\n\tA purifying night has just happened,\
  \ a night that proves that, definitely, we are not just in isolation, the environment\
  \ is a deep extension of conscious, unconscious choices and even the non-choices\
  \ of our life.\n\tIn the desert it is very easy to exist deeply, it is the very\
  \ existence without limits, with no time to finish or begin. Where does a sand dune\
  \ start and end? Is it possible to say? No, it is not possible because it is a continually\
  \ changing, growing and diminishing with the wind; being solid in a fluid way, being\
  \ dense if mountain, without ceasing to be just a speck of sand at a distance, which\
  \ is undone in the past.\n\tIn the blink of an eye the night is another here, the\
  \ sky changes every now and then with the stars (millions, countless bright spots)\
  \ spinning around us, transforming the landscape with every dream and nap in my\
  \ bed in the sand. These dreams here acquire an ultra relevant reality where you\
  \ can even choose what you want to clean or regenerate, because nothing that manifests\
  \ here is a metaphor or a symbol, sleeping on a floating land dune is like to be\
  \ rooted in a grain of sand , existing in the continuous flow of being just a handful\
  \ of tiny grains that have no identity at all, but it contains the whole world in\
  \ itself, and also existence, all the intelligence of matter and the force of the\
  \ spirit that gives us consciousness, precise identity for Being, fluidity is needed,\
  \ it is necessary to recognize with a handful of complete information that is the\
  \ whole world with each fraction and thus to form and to deform itself in the identity\
  \ that arises, or that is necessary,  what you like, or any other combination of\
  \ circumstances that momentarily forms that temporary identity that is only a format,\
  \ a portrait of the instant, just as a dune is a pile of sand ...\n\nJaisalmer,\
  \ rooftop facing the city fort, smoke, pigs, cows and children occupy the streets,\
  \ November 2017\n\n\tHere the town (village) is tire ocher, there is a sandy tone\
  \ in everything, all constructions are made with the same stone withdrawn from the\
  \ desert, and this uniformity is somehow strange and comforting, it is like knowing\
  \ what will come on the next corner , but the truth is that you do not know, because\
  \ besides the color, everything else is unknown that only ... but you know that\
  \ the brain is deceived with the uniformity and appeases before the chaos.\n\tThis\
  \ peace in the face of chaos is a `` modus operandis`` that needs to be acquired\
  \ here by these lands and somewhere in its operation the brain ends up finding its\
  \ tricks to survive.It's funny to watch this and let it work disassembled- if all,\
  \ it is interesting to have the opportunity to leave that control that we suppose\
  \ to have, and allowed to be guided by a certain do not know what of so many smells,\
  \ colors, sounds and tastes, is a compulsory and deliberate release at the same\
  \ time, and that brings rewards proportional to the quality and size of the surrender.\
  \ And when I talk about surrender, I am not talking about practical and rude terms\
  \ like trusting anyone, eating anything or going anywhere that you are invited to,\
  \ the surrender of which I am speaking here is urrender  the subtle plan, ideas,\
  \ habits and opinions of our common life, it is this surrender here that, greater\
  \ and more refined, brings greater and more rewards to the delight of being a living\
  \ body that unfolds through paths never before navigated by storms and lulls intrisects,\
  \ but never reached in the plane of everyday life.\n\tThis landscape saved me from\
  \ the ordinary, raised me from the plane of the equals, allowed me to be a traveler\
  \ of my own and so I do not let pass any possible space of walking in this country,\
  \ on this planet India."
