Text: "There are talks that Hungary is building a wall. On the way to the Belgrade\
  \ bus station, which sits at the confluence between the Save and Danube, my Swiss\
  \ travel partner and I cross paths with a Syrian family. With sign language and\
  \ the only Arabic words I can muster: marhaba, assalamualaikum and insha\u2019allah,\
  \ we greet them, offer them our last dinars and wish that peace be upon them, god\
  \ willing. As a measure of their hospitality, their two children try to offer us\
  \ some bread in return, which is all they have. \n\nA family of four, out of a million\
  \ individuals, smuggled on \u201Cdeath balloons,\u201D or flimsy orange inflatable\
  \ rubber boats, from Turkey to Greece\u2014they falter over 2000 kilometres by buses,\
  \ cars, trains and on foot in a perilous journey through the Balkan states. Many\
  \ dream of eventually settling in Germany, Sweden or the United Kingdom. Along the\
  \ way, some occupy liminal spaces in Serbia, setting up camp under highways, within\
  \ abandoned buildings, or along parking lots outside bus stations.\n\nWith five\
  \ minutes to catch our overnight bus to Skopje, Macedonia, my Swiss companion and\
  \ I bid the family farewell and safe journeys. We run to the terminal, only to be\
  \ met with a bus conductor who insists we pay 60 dinars each for baggage. We scour\
  \ through our bags and pockets, but they turn up empty. We try to explain that we\
  \ gave our money away, to which he responds with vehement eyes and knitted brows,\
  \ \u201CWhat refugees?! Tell me where you see them.\u201D To many Serbians, these\
  \ people do not exist, they are invisible and ignored, stateless and statusless.\
  \ In spite of his momentary anger, he let us board the bus. \u201C\u2018One Way\
  \ or Another,\u2019 you know Blondie?\u201D With a chuckle and a lilt in his voice,\
  \ he starts singing.\n\nTowards the end of the journey, the bus segues into Macedonia.\
  \ At some point, we lurch to a stop for an immigration check. The bus conductor\
  \ squints his eyes. He scrutinises my passport carefully. He repeats \u201CSingapore\u201D\
  \ to himself over and over again. Staggering like a child discovering a new word.\
  \ Or transposing it, as if he could chant a fictive land into existence. But even\
  \ as I wait longer than my Swiss travel partner for my passport to be returned,\
  \ I am reminded of how easy it is for me to slip from border to border without visas,\
  \ just a little red book. And how refugees travelling in the reverse direction are\
  \ forced to pay 5,000 euros or more, await GPS coordinates from their illegal smugglers,\
  \ and try their hardest to slip by fences, drones, motion detectors, thermo-vision\
  \ cameras and the police, without getting robbed, caught or attacked with tear gas\
  \ and hand grenades. \n\nI lean my head against the dusty window of the sleeper\
  \ bus. Tell me where you see them, walk a mile in their shoes. Along the 175 kilometre\
  \ fence that cuts across Europe\u2019s borderless Schengen zone. Amidst the Laistrygonians,\
  \ Cyclops, wild and angry Poseidons, capsized in the Aegean Sea, off the Greek island\
  \ of Lesbos. A baby washed ashore in Bodrum. In a few weeks, winter will arrive.\
  \ We never know if we have enough battery or credit to say hello to our loved ones.\
  \ We measure how long we\u2019ve been on the road by how many bruises or scars we\u2019\
  ve earned, how long our toenails have grown, how the soles of our shoes are disintegrating,\
  \ how the straps of our bags are falling apart. We don\u2019t know if we can hold\
  \ up another trip across the sea.\n\nCaught between stations, we were lucky to have\
  \ made our connection. It\u2019s in the little things. The kindness of a bus conductor.\
  \ The strangers who shuttle through your life, whether for the long haul or just\
  \ in passing. For the millions of human beings wanting to start a new life, I can\
  \ only wish them the same kindness as they wander towards their Ithakas, drifting\
  \ towards a place they can call home, one way or another. As the journey ached to\
  \ a close, I asked the bus conductor, \u201C\u2018Dreamin\u2019, dreamin\u2019 is\
  \ free,\u2019 you know Blondie?\u201D \n\nAnd the bus sang along."
