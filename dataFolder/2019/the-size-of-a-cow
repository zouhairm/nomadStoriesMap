Text: "Frustrataion is rising !! I\u2019m lost and tired. Taylor Swift blaring out\
  \ in my hired camper van and it\u2019s getting dark. I need to find somewhere to\
  \ park up for the night. Pulling over on the grass verge I consult my off line map\
  \ of New Zealand. 17 kms away from my destination, I heave a sigh of relief that\
  \ at least I have a mission but the sigh also signifies that I am reluctant to drive\
  \ another 17km back the way I came.\n\u201CThe long and winding road\u201D takes\
  \ on a new significance as I snake my way through beautiful tree lined lanes, meeting\
  \ nothing until I finally see the sign\u2026\u201DThe Farm\u201D. A small, dirty,\
  \ muddy parking area, somehow welcomes me and I draw up to the kitchen window, where\
  \ I can see a group of people laughing and joking inside. My heart makes a small\
  \ flutter as I feel the warmth of the group.\nAs I walk through the door there is\
  \ a sudden silence as the ten people turn and look at me. I smile and ask if I can\
  \ park up for the night.  Ellen steps out from the mass, takes my money and shows\
  \ me my space. Dark by this time, I go back to the kitchen, hands around hot tea\
  \ and join in with the fervent passionate banter around the massive kitchen table.\n\
  Up at daft o\u2019clock, Mike makes me don some rather large overalls and a pair\
  \ of ill-fitting wellington boots. I laugh at my image as I catch it in the large\
  \ kitchen window.\n\u2018Come on\u2019 he says and I perch precariously on the back\
  \ of his four-wheeler buggie. I find out on the way that he is an experienced off\
  \ road motor cross champion, which explains the speed we exit the carpark, race\
  \ down the road, squeal into a left turn and halt abruptly at the cow shed. \nThree\
  \ hundred shuffling, anxious noisy cows await the relief of their full udders. Ellen\
  \ arrives, I find myself in a pit looking up at 20 rear ends, about a foot from\
  \ them all, and I know now why I need overalls and wellingtons. Never been this\
  \ close to a cow before and as I allow the suction of the milking pumps to swallow\
  \ the pink turgid teats, a thrill surges through my body.  I move onto the next\
  \ one as the milk gurgles into the churn.\nThe process is relentless. Twenty cows\
  \ milked and another twenty cows ushered into the gated milking area. Twenty cows\u2026\
  twenty cows\u2026twenty cows\u2026.this goes on for another 4 hours. I\u2019m tired,\
  \ I\u2019m hungry, my muscles ache from lifting the heavy milking pumps up onto\
  \ the teats, but exhilarated at this unexpected experience. \nA thick layer of cream\
  \ has already settled on the holding vat and I suddenly become aware of the stale\
  \ smell of milk \u2013 my hair, my clothes, my exposed skin wreak of it and I cannot\
  \ wait to get clean. An equally hair-raising ride back with Mike to the kitchen\
  \ and a hot shower sorts me out. \nWith a plan to leave that day, I am overcome\
  \ with a surge of reluctance. I feel so welcome amidst these happy, content beautiful\
  \ people who have given me such joy, I know I am unable to leave.\nI stay another\
  \ night.\n48 hours would seem a short time to be so totally affected but driving\
  \ away, a small piece of my heart was left there with those people and those cows.\n\
  For a good week, the vivid memories of being so close to such huge animals and the\
  \ smell of stale milk, which had permeated my camper van, stayed with me. The universe\
  \ guided me to this wonderful place and I could not have wished for a better outcome."
