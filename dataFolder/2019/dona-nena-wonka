Text: "There are a few things in life that no one would ever picture together \u2013\
  \ like a chocolate factory deep in the Amazon Rainforest. However, sometimes reality\
  \ is way more imaginative than fantasy, and that is the case of Dona Nena's Chocolate\
  \ Factory placed in the Combu islands, at Belem, a city right below the Equator\
  \ line in Brazil.\nThe only way to get there is by boat \u2013 a fifteen minute\
  \ crossing through the Amazon River in a small, feeble, wood canoe called \"popopo\"\
  \ \u2013 an allusion to the constant noise it makes while on the water. The crossing\
  \ is breathtaking; the design of the boat lets the passenger sit at the same level\
  \ as the river, so it feels like the chilling water is almost about to get inside\
  \ \u2013 which honestly wouldn't be so bad as Belem is a sizzling hot city.\nOnce\
  \ the boat approaches the margin, our attention gets caught on something else -\
  \ the color green. The tree leaves are so vivid it makes every other color faint\
  \ - the river and the clouds changed into a pastel shade facing its brightness.\
  \ The boat then makes a turn into an entrance so small the unguided eye would certainly\
  \ miss; the path gets narrower, and now we can no longer see the sky, just the trees\
  \ tangling above the boat. As the non-native passengers are still trying to soak\
  \ everything in, something else hits us: the familiar smell of chocolate starts\
  \ to take over the air, just like a cup of much desired freshly made hot cocoa.\n\
  When we arrive, we are surprised to see that the factory has no walls \u2013 everything\
  \ but for a small finalization room is out in the open \u2013 there is earth under\
  \ our feet, and we are right in the middle of an immensity of cocoa trees, everywhere\
  \ we look is a mix of wild nature and chocolate, the feeling is magical. The owner,\
  \ Dona Nena shows us many other tree species too, it is important to preserve the\
  \ soil, she tells us, and here preservation is a given.\nShe takes us through all\
  \ the processes of making chocolate the original way \u2013  the cocoa is first\
  \ left to ferment in straight hammocks and a removable wood ceiling is there to\
  \ protect it from the rain in case it comes \u2013 and it will come, it is impossible\
  \ to forget that we are in the biggest rainforest in the world. The sound of the\
  \ water, the native tongue, and the birds keep you always aware you are far from\
  \ any big city, and somehow, it feels like home.\nAfter the fermentation process\
  \ is done and the seeds are dried, it is time to grind them, by hand, in a grinder\
  \ so small I keep thinking to myself, \u201CI've seen bigger ones in kitchens just\
  \ for decoration\u201D. And I ask if this is the only one they have, which Dona\
  \ Nena assures me with an easy smile that this one is just enough. The paste is\
  \ then pressed together inside a palm leaf \u2013 no sugar, no milk, no stabilizers,\
  \ only plain chocolate. Next, Dona Nena wraps the leaf with another small leaf and\
  \ the packing is done too \u2013 ready to sell. Forest to table.\nIt would be a\
  \ waste of time trying to describe how intense the chocolate tastes. The whole mouth\
  \ waters with bitterness, and then is rewarded with the sweetest umami imaginable.\
  \ It is so easy to associate chocolate with Western culture that we forget chocolate\
  \ comes from South America, from native people and their ancient knowledge. I bought\
  \ three little green packages that I keep in my cabinet locked up like gold, and\
  \ everytime I take a bite, I am suddenly transported to Dona Nena's magical universe."
