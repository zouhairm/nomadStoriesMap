Text: "A place to live, a place to die \nCounty India ..... Where each part of it\
  \ is so different yet so connected. \nwhere colour is absorbent ......... Unique\
  \ blend of people language and taste... Each part of the state has a different story\
  \ to tell. One being Indian is not the same follower of the other.\nVariety in matter\
  \ of food, dressing ,culture custom and more.\nMore I travel more I get the insights\
  \ \nVision to see the world differently ,life differently.meaning of living on this\
  \ earth , connectivity to the universe.\nI visited south north west side of India\
  \ where none are inter related.... All exclusive in its own path of living , modern\
  \ to traditional outfit and thinking is also way different in their day to day life\
  \ style. \nThe artistic culture ,the talent in artistry carving,, pot making painting\
  \ speaks out the tradition which was followed during ages.\nFood.... food is the\
  \ main attraction of the country, colour full food healthy and tasty,one of a kind,\
  \ snackies to full fledged meal and scrumptious dinner.options seems to be endless.\n\
  It has a blend of all ..... Welcoming all to love it all.\nYoga emerged from India......\
  \ which wAs once anciently known thanks for the modern times it  is called and practiced\
  \ again.\nDance and music ..... It's intense classic touch in music, the instrument\
  \ s where the beats are so soothing calming. \nEach place has its story and this\
  \ story is mine....\nYet to start and yet to move on.......\nI Iove India."
