Text: "I am lost but I\u2019m on my way!\n\nPart 1\n\nImagination and reality are\
  \ two totally different dimensions of human nature. And this is something I had\
  \ to find out during this \u201Cjourney\u201D. But what creates reality? What triggers\
  \ imagination?\nThis trip was so significant to me, for me, for the leap of faith\
  \ in me. The urge to dig into myself and find what\u2019s next to learn and discover,\
  \ what else this life is going to teach me. Open up to new dimensions and see how\
  \ the sun looks from different skies. Free fall into the new unknown. Nine whole\
  \ months are quite enough to get me out of my comfort zone and feel part of the\
  \ city. \n\tA tiny thought in the corner of my mind was the reason this journey\
  \ became reality. It was not easy, not at all. I have thought of it but at the end\
  \ I am not sure if it was just an impulsive decision. All I know is that it changed\
  \ me, still is. \n\tOn this journey I discovered the ancient land of Athens. Not\
  \ very far from home but so different and beautiful. Athens is a destination you\
  \ definitely must visit. So loud and vibrant, full of life, music, good food and\
  \ amazing sight seeings. People here for sure they know how to have fun, after all\
  \ this city never sleeps!\nYou have to climb all the hills, follow the paths that\
  \ will lead u to the sacred places where once history was changing the world. \n\
  \tWalk through the colourful Plaka with all the neoclassical houses, the souvenir\
  \ shops, the cafes and the Greek taverns with traditional cuisine and look for the\
  \ hidden small village Anafiotika just right under the Acropolis. You will be amazed\
  \ by its beauty, of how it looks like an island there in the heart of Athens, with\
  \ white walls and blue windows. Around these areas, Acropolis, Plaka, Thiseio, Monastiraki,\
  \ you will discover all the ancient buildings and ruins of the Temple of Zeus, the\
  \ Temple of Hephaestus, the ancient Roman Agora, the Attalos stoa. \n\tThis city\
  \ captures you by her big contrast from one area to another. Walk to Syntagma square\
  \ and watch the Evzones guards of the Parliament to change their shift every one\
  \ hour. Sneak into the National Garden, designed by Queen Amalia, with the Botanical\
  \ museum in grounds and find yourself lost in there, with the statues you will come\
  \ across, the small lake, the sounds of the birds and the sound of nature blended\
  \ with the sounds of the city. Inside of the Gardens you will find Zappeion Megaro\
  \ that is used as conference and exhibition centre. \n\tLook for the museums, you\
  \ definitely don\u2019t want to miss visiting the museums and there are a lot. In\
  \ the list of top 5 is the Acropolis museum, National Archeological museum, Benaki,\
  \ Cycladic art, War museum and many more.\nA tip to keep in mind before planning\
  \ your trip, every first Sunday of every month all the museums are free!\n\tStroll\
  \ around to discover the different neighbourhoods of Athens. Koukaki neighbourhood\
  \ with the cute caf\xE9s, \u201Ckafeneia\u201D and boutiques. Psyri to enjoy the\
  \ graffities on almost every wall while walking around and eat your \u201Cmeze\u201D\
  \ in a tavern, drink \u201Ctsipouro\u201D and listen to live Rembetika music. Athens\
  \ is beautiful during the day as much as during the night and you can visit her\
  \ on all seasons. If you love her, she will love you back and she will give you\
  \ amazing memories to remember, I promise!\n\t\n\tBut this is just half of the story..\
  \ \nBecause, it\u2019s two different things to be a tourist for one day and another\
  \ to experience it by living in this city.. And what about my inner journey.. \n\
  \nTo be continued\u2026."
