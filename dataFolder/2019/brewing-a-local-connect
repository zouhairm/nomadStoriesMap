Text: "As the hot air from the bowl of Thenthuk \u2013 Tibetian soupy noodle \u2013\
  \ rose up in the crisp summer air, I sit back in a bamboo chair of the Stok Palace\
  \ Museum overlooking the vast expanse of the Ladakh valley. With just an hour left\
  \ to sunset on my last day in Leh, I cherish my 20-day pilgrimage to Ladakh \u2013\
  \ the holy grail of motorcycling in India. The chatty caf\xE9 manager of the Stoke\
  \ Palace \u2013 the official seat of the Ladakhi royal family \u2013 informs me\
  \ of a unique concoction that\u2019s only produced in Ladakhi households. \u201C\
  It\u2019s called Chung. It\u2019s the Ladakhi beer. Just ask at any shop down the\
  \ road in the Stok village and they\u2019ll sell it to you if they have any left,\u201D\
  \ informed the helpful manager.\n\n\u201CCome with me,\u201D said the shopkeeper\
  \ of the general store, 200 meters from the palace, where I first enquired for Chang.\
  \ I parked my Yamaha and followed her to the next-door bungalow. Her request was\
  \ met with an uncertain denial. I peeked my head in through the a tiny opening and\
  \ requested, \u201CI\u2019m from Mumbai and I\u2019ve just learnt about your homemade\
  \ beer \u2013 Chung. Possible for me to taste some?\u201D Sensing the earnestness,\
  \ grandmother signalled her younger son to fix me a drink. I seated myself on one\
  \ of the stools in the courtyard of the single-story farm house of this Ladakhi\
  \ family waiting for this mythical alcoholic drink. The grandmother, elder daughter-in-law,\
  \ younger son, seven-year-old grandson, nine-year-old granddaughter, a dog, two\
  \ cats, six sheep and a hectare of farm land looked at this strange city dweller\
  \ who had helped himself in their front yard looking for some Chung \u2013 a beverage\
  \ that\u2019s commonly consumed during weddings and special occasions. \n\nThe daughter-in-law\
  \ poured me a mug straight out of a bucket. Whitish and tangy, but overall, Chung\u2019\
  s pretty smooth. After finishing the first drink, I shamelessly poured myself a\
  \ second one. The younger son asked me to \"take it easy.\" There I was, on the\
  \ last day of my life\u2019s biggest solo trip sitting in a Ladakhi home, sipping\
  \ their homemade brew and talking about the life in Ladakhi winters. In that moment,\
  \ I might as well have been Ian Wright. \n\nOffering them money for their hospitality\
  \ would\u2019ve been disrespectful hence I clicked portraits of the family with\
  \ a promise of sending back the hardcopies as a token of appreciation. With a population\
  \ of just 1500, I wasn\u2019t sure if any courier company would deliver the photos\
  \ to their house in the village of Stoke. The hardcopies kept gathering dust till\
  \ two years later when in 2015 I once again rode to Ladakh \u2013 this time as a\
  \ guide for my friends. This time, there wasn\u2019t a sense of curiosity of exploring\
  \ the hamlet of Stok. Only agenda was to deliver the photos. \nUnfortunately, I\
  \ couldn\u2019t locate the house. I guided my friends to the Stoke Palace to help\
  \ them understand Ladakhi history and culture. While I was waiting for them to end\
  \ their museum tour, I started flipping through the photos when one of the museum\
  \ keepers caught a glimpse of it. Looking at the grandson\u2019s picture she exclaimed,\
  \ \u201CThat\u2019s my nephew.\u201D\n\n\u201CIs he your nephew? Your family? Where\
  \ do they live?\u201D I asked with a glimmer of hope. From the top-most point of\
  \ the palace, she pointed out their bungalow. \n\nAs I knocked on the main gate,\
  \ an unfamiliar face answered it. I hadn\u2019t met the eldest son back then but\
  \ when I showed him the photographs, I was pleasantly welcomed. This time though,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t restricted to the courtyard; I was escorted to their living room.\
  \ This time though, there wasn\u2019t any Chung; however, I was offered the traditional\
  \ Ladakhi Butter Tea. Curiosity was gone but I was enveloped in a sense of familiarity.\
  \ A sense of meeting of an old friend, a family, a known face in a crowd, a warm\
  \ fireplace on a cold Ladakhi night.\n\nI clicked some more family portraits and\
  \ once again promised to deliver it to them the next time I visit Ladakh. Till then,\
  \ the scent of that cold beer and that warm butter tea lingers on my heart\u2019\
  s palate."
