Text: "The average thirteen year old typically won't find themselves clinging to the\
  \ side of a cliff face, several hundred feet above the sparkling waters of the Mediterranean.\
  \ But when in Rome. Rather, when in Cinque Terre. \nThe Italian national park has\
  \ some of the most spectacular hiking in the world. However, the previous October\u2019\
  s mudslides drove us further up the coast. While by April, the coastal towns had\
  \ rebuilt the streets, houses, and confidence of the Italian locals, the park struggled\
  \ to repair its hiking trails. Undeterred, My mother, brother, and I traveled north\
  \ along the Rivera. In town outside of Genoa, we found the perfect spot. There was\
  \ a scenic route that wound along the coastal ridgeling, culminating at a vista\
  \ overlooking the sea. The trail was about an hour of moderate hiking, so we only\
  \ packed a light bag with water and the map from our book. \nThe scenery was breathtaking.\
  \ Rolling gray green outcroppings folded over into the sea, and each hillside was\
  \ dotted with tiny houses and olive groves perched on slopes and terraces. The weather\
  \ was perfect, and the time flew by. None of us read Italian, so we relied on the\
  \ signs with blue arrows to point us along. But after our third water break, my\
  \ mother started to worry about how long we had been hiking. \n\t\u201CMaybe we\
  \ should head back,\u201D she said. \n\t\u201CWe shouldn\u2019t just turn around!\
  \ Its probably just a little bit further,\u201D my brother said. \nMy brother, after\
  \ all, specifically chose this hike, his ego wasn\u2019t about to let him give up\
  \ before we saw the \u201Cperfect vista,\u201D as he called it. So we went a little\
  \ further. \n\t\u201CIts gotta be just around the next outcrop!\u201D He rehashed\
  \ twenty minutes later. \nSo we walked a little further. \n\tHowever my mother started\
  \ to raise real concern when the trail disappeared, replaced by a two foot wide\
  \ ledge along the precipice, accompanied only by a steel chain bolted in the rock\
  \ on the left side. The drop was straight down at least 300 feet. But the blue arrow\
  \ pointed across, and eventually my mother was convinced to go \u201Cjust a little\
  \ further\u201D yet again. As I bounced along the cliffside, a grimacing woman chanted\
  \ \u201Clook at your feet, hold on to the chain, look at your feet, hold on to the\
  \ chain,\u201D right behind me. After that, the \u201Clittle bit furthers\u201D\
  \ got easier. She was not going to let us go back along that ledge. Besides, we\
  \ all agreed that we would run into a town or waypoint sooner or later. \n\tHours\
  \ later, we were proven right. A signpost at the top of a high ridge indicated a\
  \ town on the map, only two kilometers away. It was falling into dusk as we zigzagged\
  \ down switch-backs towards the town. Looking down, we saw the community was dominated\
  \ by an enormous abbey which our book said was over a thousand years old. Our book\
  \ also said that it was completely isolated, only accessible by a boat taxi which\
  \ stopped running at dusk. We decided not to worry, planning to find a place in\
  \ town to sleep. But as we got closer, we encountered a problem. There was no one\
  \ there. The whole town appeared completely deserted, the restaurants boarded up\
  \ and the houses dark. While my brother was busy mumbling something about horror\
  \ movies, my mother searched for a place we could try breaking into for the night.\
  \ Then, we saw the tiniest wisp of smoke coming from a few houses over. \n\tAn elderly\
  \ Italian man answered the door. He spoke no English, and we were only able to scratch\
  \ by on the similarities between his Italian and my brother\u2019s high school level\
  \ Spanish. With halting confusion, we emerged thirty minutes later, after coming\
  \ to a tentative understanding. The elderly man called his son in law to come pick\
  \ us up in his boat and take us back to the  town. We waited on the docks, huddled\
  \ up against each other under the only light jacket we had, playing monopoly on\
  \ my mothers iPad. And while we waited, the little old Italian man came down from\
  \ his house and brought us Easter candy."
