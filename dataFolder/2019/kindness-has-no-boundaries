Text: "South Korea was never in my bucket list. It was always England that I wanted\
  \ to visit since I am the biggest fan of Liverpool FC. Yet, everything changed when\
  \ I read a traveling book written by Marina. She traveled with the help of a hospitality\
  \ website called Hospitalityclub.org. Triggered by her success, I found myself being\
  \ challenged to do the same thing. \n\nAfter the hustle and bustle about applying\
  \ for the visa and finding hosts, I finally arrived in South Korea. To tell you\
  \ the truth, as Muslim wearing hijab, I was a bit scared since hijab in 2010 probably\
  \ wasn\u2019t a familiar sight in South Korea. With the terrorism issue, it even\
  \ made me feel more insecure. However, the moment I met my first host, all those\
  \ things were gone in a second. My host was so warm that she even hugged me. I was\
  \ a bit dumbfounded by her reaction. We barely knew each other, but without any\
  \ prejudice, she welcomed me as her friend. \n\nThe same stories continued. I always\
  \ got a warm welcome from all my hosts. One more thing that I found very touching\
  \ was that they all concerned about me being a Muslim. They often asked what I could\
  \ or could not eat. When we met I found out that before they had me in their houses,\
  \ they had prepared themselves by searching for some information concerning the\
  \ practice of Muslim and Indonesian people. I couldn\u2019t believe that they put\
  \ so much effort into trying to understand me as their guest. I believe I was one\
  \ of the luckiest backpacker newbies. \n\nThere was one moment when I suddenly missed\
  \ my mom. It was Ramadhan month and I was in Wonju on the way to Soraksan. My host\
  \ in Wonju was a female soldier named Kyu Won. She lived with her mom. I was fasting\
  \ when I arrived in Kyu Won\u2019s home. Before I reached her house, she asked me\
  \ about the food that I was allowed to eat. She told me her mom prepared me some\
  \ chicken for dinner so I would not have any problem. I was so touched and thankful.\n\
  \nWhen Kyu Won\u2019s mom learned that I was fasting, she was so worried. Well,\
  \ the idea of not eating from early morning till sunset might be a bit hard to understand.\
  \ She even felt sad and guilty as she learned that I ate cold instant rice for sahur\
  \ that early morning. Kyu Won told me that her mom promised to prepare some food\
  \ for my next sahur. As I read her short message on the way to Soraksan, I tried\
  \ hard not to cry. I couldn\u2019t believe they both really cared about me.\n\n\
  Mom, that\u2019s how I finally called her, cooked special food that early morning.\
  \ She prepared bibimbap for my early breakfast or sahur. Suddenly I felt, I couldn\u2019\
  t swallow the food. My chest felt so heavy that I couldn\u2019t hold any longer.\
  \ At last, I burst into tears while I was chewing my bibimbap. Seeing me crying,\
  \ mom asked what had happened. I could only say I then stopped for several seconds\
  \ before continuing my words as my tears kept falling down. She, then, came approaching\
  \ me. I told her she reminded me of my mom and it was sad that I had to say goodbye\
  \ to her.  She held me in her arms and said, \u201CWhenever you miss me or you\u2019\
  re in trouble, call me. I will come to you as soon as I can although I don\u2019\
  t know where you are.\u201D At that moment, I couldn\u2019t help myself but weep\
  \ in her embrace. I told myself I was a darn lucky backpacker. I even got another\
  \ mom here.  \n\nI feel that all my hosts back then are angels sent from above.\
  \ This may sound exaggerated, but for me, an introvert who was traveling abroad\
  \ for the first time and being treated so kindly by those whom I barely knew, they\
  \ are angels without wings. All those differences, language, culture even religion,\
  \ didn\u2019t stop them from being so kind to me. That\u2019s what I learn from\
  \ people to people contact kind of traveling, kindness has no boundaries."
