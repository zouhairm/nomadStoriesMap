Text: "Jews around the world. I am a member of the Jewish community in Buenos Aires,\
  \ and also I am a fascinated observer of my community. From behind the lens of my\
  \ camera I become at once an insider and outsider, an actor and a witness. Through\
  \ the images I try to tell the stories of Argentinian Jewry, the largest Jewish\
  \ population in Latin America. Some of my photographs capture moments of everyday\
  \ experience. For example,  In El Once, the historic Jewish quarter in Buenos Aires,\
  \ we glimpse children at school, merchants at work, congregants at prayer. Others\
  \ reveal the more specific cultural and historical context that have shaped the\
  \ identities of Argentine Jews over the past century and a half: most somberly,\
  \ the annual public gathering and protest to commemorate the 1994 terrorist attack\
  \ on the AMIA community building.\nNorth of the city, in the Pampas, I made a photo\
  \ essay where I document villages of Jewish gauchos in the rural Entre Rios province.\
  \ Founded by Yiddish-speaking Jews who first arrived in the 1890s as colonists from\
  \ Eastern Europe, these historic communities are rapidly vanishing. I showed extraordinary\
  \ individuals such as Jaime Jruz, who worked the land and remained a soul of his\
  \ kehillah (community) until his last days. \nI would like on a trip to Portugal,\
  \ to be able to find a community of immigrant Jews or descendants of immigrants\
  \ from Eastern Europe, who are still holding in Portugal."
