Text: "In October 2018 I travelled to China to work as an English Teacher in a children\
  \ training centre. I always worked in the Art industry until I took the plunge to\
  \ move to Beijing all on my own. A very brave decision as friends and family thought,\
  \ but I needed to do this for my personal growth, a challenge, a life change, but\
  \ most of all for my insatiable thirst for explorations and adventures across the\
  \ Planet. \nOnce I finally made it to China, whenever I had a day off I was out\
  \ exploring Beijing and beyond. It felt like a clean sheet full of possibilities.\
  \ Beijing is boundless, the biggest megalopolis I\u2019ve even seen in my life.\
  \ Everything was alien to me, but I loved that. The more I saw the more I was captivated\
  \ by the deeply multifaceted soul of the city.  \nSoaked in its history unfolding\
  \ in the old and run down areas, but also projected into the future, with its modern\
  \ and high-end financial districts and fancy skyscraper complexes. Such contrasting\
  \ skylines, so striking, so unique. The people reflected that multifaceted essence\
  \ too, which was very fascinating to discover. So attached to their traditions,\
  \ their political heritage, their food, their family bonds, their group folk dances\
  \ on the streets and their Tai Chi practices in the parks, but always with a mind\
  \ over advanced technology in their daily life.    \nIn  the Forbidden City, a legend\
  \ on its own, I was in utter awe as soon as I laid my feet on its gilded courtyard\
  \ and looked up at that Majesty. It\u2019s like a monolith of the Earth, and it\u2019\
  s hard to describe the grandeur of the opulent architecture of those huge gates,\
  \ pavilions and dragon statues that surround you.  \nWhile wondering in the magnificent\
  \ Summer Palace's Gardens between bright red Imperial walls and curled up roofs,\
  \ praying Buddhas solemnly gazing from their regal niches, drooping willow trees\
  \ creating atmospheric reflections on rippled water, next to old Chinese men lazily\
  \ fishing in the pond near dusk\u2026 I had the biggest illumination of my life.\
  \ All the vivid though evanescent visions of romantic Oriental sights in the Golden\
  \ Hour which filled my imagination since I can remember, materialized before my\
  \ eyes, like magic. Whoever says magic doesn't exist knows nothing. \nVisiting Yonghegong\
  \ Lama Temple, the most important Tibetan Temple in Beijing, was mind boggling.\
  \ The Buddha statues inside the Temple are stunning, and I had the biggest surprise\
  \ when I found out that their size keeps growing in every pavilion you enter, until\
  \ you reach the last pavilion at the bottom of the courtyard where you find yourself\
  \ before a HUGE Buddha rising from your feet up to the ceiling, gazing at the infinite,\
  \ the level of his towering height. My marvel was so high then that I was in a sort\
  \ of trance (aided by the overwhelming smell of incense being burned by the praying\
  \ people), and this whole sensorial journey is something I\u2019ll never forget.\
  \ \nAnd how can I not linger on the dreamy memories of Zhujiajiao ancient water\
  \ town? This is such a little corner of Heaven where time seems to have crystallized.\
  \ Things haven't changed much over the centuries and the locals like to keep their\
  \ strong traditions. It's so surreal to stroll around its streets and alleys, it\
  \ feels like you're suddenly teleported into one of those ancient ink paintings\
  \ from the Ming Dynasty times. The colours I saw over there are fairy-tale like,\
  \ sheer visual poetry. In the centre there's a whole array of little stalls that\
  \ sell an endless variety of local handmade food, such as \"stinky tofu\" and rice\
  \ dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves, and on the streets by the canals, streamed\
  \ by traditional little wooden rowed boats, I watched lovely elderly ladies making\
  \ their delicacies. Then in another area I walked past many charming cafes which\
  \ have little balconies overlooking the river; I picked one and sat for a while,\
  \ admiring the spectacle of bewildering nature while drinking flower-infused tea\
  \ and listening to old Chinese tunes being played on the streets. Bliss. \nSince\
  \ my return home China has been here within me, and I know it will never leave."
