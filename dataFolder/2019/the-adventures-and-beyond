Text: "Napa has been the small dome I\u2019ve lived in my whole entire life, and I\
  \ have always wanted to know what was beyond that dome. Since I was 7, I have wanted\
  \ to travel and study abroad in the United Kingdom so bad that I begged my father\
  \ to take me there for years.\nIt wasn\u2019t all that successful up until this\
  \ year where we finally found the time and money to go there.\nWhen we first made\
  \ it to London to the car rental, almost right away we got a flat tire. We had to\
  \ swerve and hit a curb to avoid hitting another car, which then made us wait four\
  \ hours for help and to get another car.\nThe first university I visited was called\
  \ Brunel University, just on the side of London. We had a very nice tour guide and\
  \ he gave us many reasons why Brunel was an amazing school.\nAfter the tour, we\
  \ got back into our blue Mini Cooper and drove off to the next destination, Bath.\
  \ Bath was this quaint little town. Our Airbnb host said that \u201CYou could walk\
  \ from one side to the other in just 15 minutes.\u201D So far I knew this was going\
  \ to be my kind of town.\nWe visited the Bath Spa University (yes that is the name\
  \ of their school) the next day, and I absolutely fell in love with the place. They\
  \ had almost everything I was looking for in a school and more. The campus was surrounded\
  \ by many farm animals and had an amazing view of these hills.\n\nI was sad to have\
  \ to leave Bath, but that didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t enjoy the other schools.\
  \ The last three schools I saw were Cardiff, Aberystwyth (ABER-IST-WITH) and London\
  \ College of Creative Media, or LCCM. I loved each school in their different ways\
  \ and was glad I could see them.\n\nWhile we were in Wales, we visited Cardiff Castle,\
  \ an amazing old castle that used to have royalty (duh) living there. We also saw\
  \ Abergavenny and Llanelen (LA-NEL-AN) where my grandmother and great grandmother\
  \ lived and grew up. Abergavenny was just a tiny little town but it was so beautiful\
  \ to visit.\n\nWhen we first got to Aberystwyth, our second car accident happened.\
  \ We tried passing by a stopped delivery truck and nicked the side mirror. Luckily,\
  \ it didn\u2019t make us late to the school tour.\nOnce we left Wales, we drove\
  \ three hours all the way towards Oxford to meet a friend I had known for a while.\
  \ We met up at a mall and exchanged candies. I decided to buy her Laffy Taffy and\
  \ Ghirardelli, while she got me Jaffa Cakes, Squashies and these chocolate Oreos,\
  \ which were Oreo minis inside a chocolate bar.\nEverything was delicious and we\
  \ even had time to look around some stores to do a little shopping for ourselves.\
  \ When it was time to go, it was sad, but I don\u2019t regret meeting her. When\
  \ we got back into London, we decided there was no use for the car anymore so we\
  \ returned it back to the car rental place and ordered an Uber to our next Airbnb.\n\
  Our last day after the LCCM tour, we decided to walk around central London and see\
  \ some things I have been dying to see. One of those things I wanted to see was\
  \ the Big Ben. I have wanted to see the Big Ben since I have wanted to visit the\
  \ UK.\nI even had the Twitter notifications on for the Big Ben Twitter page; I suggest\
  \ you follow them if you have Twitter, @big_ben_clock. We walked around trying to\
  \ find the Big Ben and when we finally did, it was under construction and will be\
  \ until mid-2019. Luckily, we could still see the clock so it wasn\u2019t a huge\
  \ disappointment.\nIn all, it was sad to leave, but I did miss home to begin with\
  \ so I was happy to come home and see my friends and family."
