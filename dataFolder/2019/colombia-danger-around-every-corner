Text: "When I said I was going to Colombia, many people expressed their concerns.\
  \ Colombia has a frightening reputation for drug wars, kidnappings, and murders.\
  \ However, it has recently also become an enticing new destination for travelers.\
  \ Despite the warnings, I decided to travel around the country and witness the situation\
  \ with my own eyes.\n\nYes, once Colombia was a big mess. Since the creation of\
  \ the Republic of Colombia, the country did not enjoy much stability. There were\
  \ many conflicts between the Liberal and Conservative parties. Also, many problems\
  \ of corruption and social inequality led to the rise of extreme left wings like\
  \ the FARC, ELN, and M-19. On top of that, the production and trafficking of drugs\
  \ by Pablo Escobar\u2019s and other drug cartels poured more gasoline on the fire.\
  \ The cocaine business was lucrative, but even more destructive. The root of the\
  \ narco problem, however, was the high demand, mainly coming from Western societies.\
  \ Violence was taking over the country and lasted for several decades. The drug\
  \ wars and internal (political) conflicts killed tens of thousands of often innocent\
  \ people.\n\nIn the last decades, Colombia\u2019s situation has improved impressively.\
  \ With Pablo Escobar\u2019s death in 1993, many of the cartels were brought down.\
  \ Also, the general security in the country was raised. And, in 2016, the government\
  \ finally signed a peace deal with the left-wing group FARC.\n\nSome scars of the\
  \ violent past are still visible today. In Medell\xEDn, for example, two sculptures\
  \ of birds can be observed at the San Antonio Plaza. These \u201CBirds of Peace\u201D\
  \ by the famous sculptor Botero mark the end of the era of war. The left bird is\
  \ damaged, blasted to pieces by a bombing in 1995; whereas on the right stands an\
  \ identical, undamaged and cheerful bird which was donated years later as a symbol\
  \ of peace. The city of Medell\xEDn is nowadays considered one of the most innovative\
  \ and secure cities in South America.\n\nAs such, Colombia is not as bad as it once\
  \ was. Actually, a lot of problems can be avoided by using common sense and caution.\
  \ Especially the highly tourist-ridden parts of Colombia are usually out of the\
  \ conflict zones, enjoying increased security. As a female traveler, I never felt\
  \ unsafe while being there neither did I experience any act of violence. In my opinion,\
  \ Colombians are probably one of the most friendly, warm-heartedly and cheerful\
  \ people who live in South America. However, it is still important to take some\
  \ precautions. This is not only true for Colombia, but for all countries located\
  \ on the South American continent. Besides listening to your instincts, there is\
  \ only one thing left for you to do: Enjoy your time to the fullest and be prepared\
  \ to fall in love with Colombia!"
