Text: "A rainforest can be unrelenting. It\u2019s a constant battle between the humidity\
  \ in the squelching sun and that after a healthy downpour. It would be two weeks\
  \ of this- the cool morning air, the fiery afternoon sun and the evening showers\
  \ trying to grace us with relief from the heat. \n\nThe Maderas Rainforest Conservancy\
  \ accepted us with fervor. The veterinary field mission school would help pets and\
  \ farm animals wherever possible. This work came with the bonus of treks into the\
  \ forest and a well appreciated stream of information from the owner and host, Rene\xE9\
  . I arrived in Costa Rica earlier than the others and had dinner with her in the\
  \ city. The restaurant gave me my fill of plantains and beans while Rene\xE9 gave\
  \ me my fill about Costa Rica. I had a lot to look forward to. \n\nI always have\
  \ a simultaneous sense of calm and excitement when going into the forest. Water\
  \ bottles and raincoats on hand, we head out in our daily mist of insect repellant.\
  \ Green and black poison dart frogs jump out of sight. Their red and blue cousins\
  \ do the same. A jungle crab scurries under a tree branch that is so low it almost\
  \ kisses the ground. An iguana, moss green and larger than most would appreciate,\
  \ jumps off one end of the swinging bridge to make way for the eager students crossing\
  \ Rio La Suerte. About 20 minutes in, we start feeling raindrops. Prepared, and\
  \ with a canopy that shelters from a sprinkle, we trek on. 10 minutes later, we\
  \ get one of the rainforest\u2019s \u2018turn back\u2019 messages- a poisonous snake\
  \ is on the path. Heeding the warning, and with the rain now pelting down, we head\
  \ back. But the rainforest never disappoints. We are almost out when shaking branches\
  \ attract our gaze- monkeys. Howler monkeys and spider monkeys are having a stand\
  \ off in trees on opposite sides of the path. Rain forgotten, we gather to take\
  \ pictures. It was an almost otherworldly moment, one that we wouldn\u2019t get\
  \ to experience again.\n\nThe days flew by. A phenomenon that only happens when\
  \ you\u2019re truly enjoying yourself. On one of my many solo walks on the property\
  \ I noticed something familiar. Looking up, hoping to spot the silhouette of a toucan,\
  \ its beak revealing its identity no matter the distance, I saw a single soursop.\
  \ At the top of the tree, it\u2019s prickly, dark green skin left no doubt in my\
  \ mind what it was. That seemingly simple fruit gave me a feeling of home. I made\
  \ a mental note to ask Rene\xE9 about it. The locals almost definitely did not call\
  \ it \u2018soursop\u2019.\n\nThe next day were we hard at work in the little makeshift\
  \ surgery room with a single oscillating fan attempting to make the conditions bearable\
  \ for the surgeon to operate. Rene\xE9 was observing the surgery and not mentioning\
  \ the name, I asked her about the fruit. After thinking about where I saw it, she\
  \ said, guan\xE1bana. I told her that we used it to make a drink back home and smiling,\
  \ she said the locals do too. She promised to make sure I got some before I left.\
  \ I saw the offer as kind, but quickly removed it from thought, not expecting them\
  \ to actually make the drink. After another boiling day, we headed back to the main\
  \ building for dinner. The chatter in the room was like a sigh of relief; a hectic\
  \ day was done, and we could relax. The group headed to the food. The white liquid\
  \ caught my attention. Another student questioned it. I longed for the answer. Guan\xE1\
  bana juice. I was thrilled. The taste brought with it the memory of the Jamaican\
  \ air. The smooth creamy liquid smelled almost like pineapples, but tasted like\
  \ a heavenly bouquet of citrus fruits, bananas and strawberries. It was like getting\
  \ something you never even realized you were longing for. \n\nI had seen, heard\
  \ and smelled the wonders of the forest. I had enjoyed foods, both old and new.\
  \ No matter what happened next, I knew I\u2019d always be able to say that I loved\
  \ Costa Rica."
