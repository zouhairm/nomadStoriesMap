Text: "It was Sunday night, I had just arrived in Paris after 24 hours between connections\
  \ from Rio de Janeiro. Couldn\xB4t imagine that the following hours would change\
  \ my life that much. It was my second time in Paris, after 7 years. \n\nThe idea\
  \ was to visit a friend of mine that had recently moved to France. It started as\
  \ a non-planned trip, but suddenly it turned out to be one of the most special trips\
  \ I\xB4ve done so far.\n \nAfter arriving in my hotel room, I immediately took a\
  \ shower, put my bathrobe on and had a glass of wine. While relaxing, decided to\
  \ open my dating app to check what was going on. Well, on my way from the airport\
  \ to Saint-Germain-des-Pr\xE9s, I crossed a very special someone\xB4s path. However,\
  \ our paths crossed first in a mobile application.\n  \nWe started talking, first\
  \ in French, and then in English \u2013 by that time I was already done with my\
  \ French vocabulary. He was travelling to London on Tuesday, and Monday lunch would\
  \ be our only chance to meet. It sounded perfect, since I was alone in town until\
  \ my friend\u2019s arrival. \n\nLet\xB4s meet in front of Cinema Path\xE9, in 17th\
  \ arrondissement, he said. I had no idea of what it was, but I said yes. It was\
  \ time to go and I still didn\xB4t know quite well how to get there. Decided to\
  \ get a car by app, would be faster and more accurate. I was feeling anxious and\
  \ didn\xB4t know what I was doing.\n\nPeople say that in Paris everybody is rude\
  \ and not willing to help. In my point of view, that\u2019s not true at all. All\
  \ my experiences with French people went out as best as possible. When I got in\
  \ the car, the driver started talking a lot. The route took me about 20 minutes\
  \ and we spent all the way talking \u2013 was feeling so confident about my French!\
  \ Was quite sure that I would start my date speaking a lot of French. \n\nI arrived\
  \ at the cinema a little bit late and feeling terrible about it, but he wasn\u2019\
  t there. Not until I turn around and see this guy taking his helmet off and putting\
  \ his hair back in place. Suddenly, it seemed as everything else was in slow motion.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t say a word. Not in French, English or even in Portuguese. I was\
  \ officially speechless.  \n\nWe went to a restaurant nearby and had some cr\xEA\
  pes for lunch. So frenchy! We had a very nice talk and found out that we had a lot\
  \ in common. After lunch, he asked if I wanted to go for a walk in Montmartre. \n\
  \nMy feeling was such as being in a very romantic movie and couldn\u2019t realize\
  \ that it was happening for real. I said yes and we started climbing the amazing\
  \ and charming stairs of this neighborhood.\n\nI was already amazed by everything\
  \ but then he mentioned that the famous coffee shop from Am\xE9lie Poulain\xB4s\
  \ movie was close to where we were. This movie is my favorite. \u201CJe suis Am\xE9\
  lie\u201D, I used to say. The place was too crowded, but we took a picture in front\
  \ of it. \u201CAmour court les rues\u201D, was written on the background. In Paris,\
  \ even street art is romantic. \n\nWhile walking around, suddenly he stopped, and\
  \ we kissed. I was feeling so lucky to be in such a magic date, in one of the most\
  \ romantic spots in the world and in Paris! We kept walking a little bit more and\
  \ sat down on the stairs of Sacr\xE9-Coeur. \n\nLater, he went back to work and\
  \ we couldn\xB4t meet again in Paris. In a couple of days, he joined me in Brussels.\
  \ Five months later, he came to Rio to see me and we also went to Iguazu Falls.\
  \ \n\nNow here I go again, back to the place where I once said that I left my heart.\
  \ When I was on my way to Paris last year, I wrote that I was coming back to find\
  \ some pieces of me that I\xB4ve left 7 years ago. I might have found it, but my\
  \ heart is still there. Paris, j\xB4arrive!"
