Text: "He snuck into the back of the wedding van.   \n\nAlthough Miguel and I are\
  \ the same age, we differ in everything else. We had never met before\u2014until\
  \ Valverde del Fresno, in the C\xE1ceres province, the west-most region of Extremadura.\
  \ Miguel traveled 527 kilometres from Galicia; I, 6032km from Toronto. \n\nDiverbo,\
  \ sponsored by El Ministerio de Educaci\xF3n, hosts immersion programs to improve\
  \ English language skills among Spanish youth. In Valverde, twelve native Anglophones\
  \ are selected among a global pool of applicants to volunteer as camp counsellors:\
  \ I was selected in the summer of 2015. Volunteers are provided free room and board;\
  \ the Spanish students, however, pay a substantial fee in order to attend the camp.\n\
  \nThe program operated on one simple yet challenging rule: \u201COnly English\u201D\
  . Everyone was required to speak in English, regardless of individual proficiency\
  \ levels. \n\nHe smiled as I spoke to him, nodding in ostensible agreement with\
  \ each word. It gradually dawned on me that he did not comprehend much of what I\
  \ had said. Once the supervisors were out of earshot, I spoke to him in half-English,\
  \ half-Spanish. Miguel, visibly relieved, replied in the same linguistic hodgepodge.\
  \ We talked for hours, fascinated by each other\u2019s country and culture. Miguel\
  \ came from a family of eight; his parents, grandparents, hermana, and hermanito.\
  \ He grew up in a small house that nurtured hard work and family values. I, on the\
  \ other hand, have lived with only my parents for my whole life\u2014a small family\
  \ that instilled big aspirations and international opportunity. \n\n\u201CHow was\
  \ your viaje a Valverde?\u201D, I asked him, in reply to him asking about my flight.\
  \ \n\n\"It was not f\xE1cil.\"\n\nMiguel\u2019s family scarcely had the means to\
  \ send him to camp. Diverbo provided a chartered bus to pick up students from specified\
  \ hotels and railway stations on the east route. But because of the remoteness of\
  \ Miguel\u2019s home town, along with his village\u2019s lack of public transportation\
  \ and his family\u2019s lack of access to a car, Miguel was hard pressed to get\
  \ to Valverde. He was awarded a scholarship to attend Diverbo, but therein stood\
  \ Miguel\u2019s paradox: \n\nHow on earth would he get there? \n\nHis solution found\
  \ him, when he passed a local gas station, in the form of a wedding van. Ponte Taboada,\
  \ a city with a railway station that Diverbo listed as a pick up location, was also\
  \ a popular place for weddings. Through assuming this as the destination, Miguel\
  \ quietly climbed into the van, behind the musical instruments, regalia, and bouquets\
  \ of flowers. The van stopped for petrol and Miguel\u2014as he relayed the story\
  \ to me\u2014took that opportunity to bolt out and to run to a nearby bus shelter.\
  \ I am uncertain, to this day, about the exact details of his journey to Velha F\xE1\
  brica, our Valverde venue. \n\n\u201CIt was worth the trip\u201D, he laughed, amused\
  \ by my incredulity. \n\nAs camp came to an end, we all said our goodbyes. Although\
  \ I anticipated my 3am flight back to Toronto, I could not help but anxiously wonder\
  \ how in the world Miguel would get home. \n\n\u201CThere\u2019s always a way,\u201D\
  \ he smiled, \u201CHasta luego.\u201D \n\nAs I write this, I reflect upon Miguel\
  \ and his last words. There must, indeed, always be a way. My service in Spain holds\
  \ deep significance for me nearly four years later \u2014 in regards to my grandmother's\
  \ recent passing after nine months of hospitalization. I attended to her frequently\
  \ at St. Michael\u2019s hospital, where she recounted her youth. She was a mother\
  \ of five, moving from province to province as a chemistry professor and researcher.\
  \ Throughout her last days, she smilingly reflected upon her peripatetic life; I\
  \ smiled as she took pride in recounting it.\n\nMiguel and my grandmother could\
  \ not be more different; but they similarly chased, obstacles notwithstanding, their\
  \ respective goals."
