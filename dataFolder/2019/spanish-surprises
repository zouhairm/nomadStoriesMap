Text: "That sudden heat in the early summer reminded me of the day she died.. My sister,\
  \ my best friend, she had been gone for just over a year. She had only been sick\
  \ for 7 months, it just didn't seem fair.... Everyone back home needed me, I had\
  \ to stay in Dublin, but I knew that I desperately needed to do something for myself,\
  \ for my own grief, something to let it out. \"A trip away! That's the perfect thing\"\
  \ I thought to myself \"I'll go by myself, I always enjoy travelling alone, having\
  \ new experiences\" but everyone worried about me and felt I would be lonely on\
  \ my own at such a difficult time in my life. All I cared about was sitting on a\
  \ beach where no one needed anything from me and I could read my book before dinner\
  \ and enjoy a glass of wine by the sea. So off I went that summer to Alicante, to\
  \ heal, by myself for two weeks. \n\nMost days, I went swimming, ate nice food and\
  \ played with the kittens in my Air B and B apartment, I had a daily routine of\
  \ popping down to the old part of town at night, touching the walls of the beautiful\
  \ sandstone buildings and the red, silky petals of roses for sale by the old cathedral\
  \ as I made my way down through all the little winding streets, each one hiding\
  \ its own special secrets. After dinner, I always went to my favourite bar, La Taverna,\
  \ by the edge of the water, the friendly waiter knew me well after the first few\
  \ days and knew my order and the fact that I would need two helpings of peanuts\
  \ as I wrote and wrote for hours in my journal. At the end of the first week I realised\
  \ that they were building temporary structures all around the town, there were very\
  \ pretty installations popping up here, there and everywhere, mostly of people with\
  \ painted faces and bodies. I asked my host what this was all about and she said,\
  \ \"Didn't you know? Its La Fiesta San Juan this weekend\" I was suddenly filled\
  \ with excitement and anticipation of what was to come.  \n\nThe next day the entire\
  \ town was transformed into a buzzing melting pot of culture and fun, people from\
  \ all over Spain and the Valencia region came to partake in the festivities. The\
  \ giant sculptures were unveiled and people stood in awe of their beauty, taking\
  \ photos and beaming up at these colorful wonders, children blew bubbles below and\
  \ played chasing around them. Samba drummers and fireworks were suddenly around\
  \ every corner, people were drinking beer and eating from pigs on spits, they were\
  \ dancing with me, including me in the celebrations. The smell of smoke from fireworks,\
  \ cooking meat and cigarettes surrounded me, curled together in the hot Spanish\
  \ air like some kind of recipe for exultation. The beats, rhythms and sound of drumming,\
  \ laughter and the tapping of feet was everywhere. That evening I watched a parade\
  \ of flamenco dancers tap their way through the streets in their flowery dresses\
  \ as I made my way to another bar, I met a group of Italians and danced with them\
  \ to Spanish music for hours! The best dance of all though, was the one I had as\
  \ the evening came to a close with my sister on my way home, at another temporary\
  \ Taverna full of \"fiesta\" I had quite a bit of vino consumed at this stage of\
  \ the day, but for the first time in years I didn't care who was watching me dance,\
  \ I danced and danced until I felt the joy of my sister's spirit returning to me,\
  \ dancing with me... My hair was wet with sweat, my smile bigger than anyone's there\
  \ and my energy was free, I opened my eyes and everyone was smiling surprised at\
  \ me, happy to see someone so free, so full of joy and without a care in the world.\
  \ Once again, the mediterranean world had set me free to be myself, to make me feel\
  \ alive, to heal. That night I slept better than I had in two long years. LL"
