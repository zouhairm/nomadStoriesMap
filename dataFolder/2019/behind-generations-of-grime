Text: "I land in the pervasive Hungarian greyness on a late January afternoon. \n\
  I wait at the baggage carousel with a vacant stare; by my side a friend I barely\
  \ know. Upon arrival in Budapest I feel ready, tense like a slingshot about to launch.\
  \ We take a taxi and arrive in Erszhebet K\xF6rut, watching the outskirts melting\
  \ away behind us from the taxi window. We are slow to count out the fare and the\
  \ taxi driver smiles knowingly at our incompetence. He helps us make sense of the\
  \ forints, unloads our heavy bags, and warns us to keep an eye out. Getting back\
  \ into the car, he wishes us good luck.\n\nIn Lisbon it didn\u2019t seem to be winter.\
  \ I had left with little money and had been eating pasteis de belem for lunch or\
  \ dinner the entire week while I was staying in a hellhole disguised as a hostel.\
  \ While heading back on the unexpectedly fast and punctual Lisbon metro, I was already\
  \ seeking an all-encompassing picture of this place: the flux of the streets, the\
  \ overheard whispers from behind the coloured tiles and that sense of dirty joy\
  \ that comes from digging deeper into the void rather than filling it. \n\nFor the\
  \ entire crossing of the vast K\xF6rut the sound of the Hungarian language, flowing\
  \ and musical, continues to echo through my head. Until now I\u2019ve never heard\
  \ such harsh yet honey-sweet sounds together. We press the buzzer and Alireza answers\
  \ us: a bizarre Iranian man with huge eyes overflowing with melancholy memories.\
  \ We take the lift and arrive at the fourth floor of an apartment complex typical\
  \ of the Hungarian capital: tall, cement, at once imposingly soviet and royally\
  \ elegant.\n\nInside the apartment everything is filthy; walls hidden behind generations\
  \ of grime, floors sticky from long-ago spilled beer; and the toilet covered in\
  \ shit. We walk along an endlessly long and impossibly tight corridor, continuously\
  \ impeded by the broken doors of a long white wardrobe. Panic takes us. We drop\
  \ the bags and run.\n\nLooking back from Humberto Delgado airport, I could see Lisbon,\
  \ the houses perched ontop of one another. I wish I had had more time there. I felt\
  \ as though I had been to a French patisserie, having had just enough time to nibble\
  \ the end of a chocolate eclair, only to be whisked away, salivating and with an\
  \ unsatisfied stomach. And so I saw Lisbon shrinking away in the distance and I\
  \ thought of Ruben, the bearded boy with dark, long hair who played the guitar at\
  \ the Miradouro da Senhora do Monte. I had fallen in love with him and I had just\
  \ begun to taste the air of home. By the following morning my head was heavy with\
  \ the night before at Barrio Alto; already I had to say goodbye to everything: the\
  \ familiarity and Ruben. \n\nThe air is cold, but not bitterly so. Only in the following\
  \ days will we realise how kind the city has been for our first evening as its guests;\
  \ perhaps it is searching for redem-ption for our discouraging welcome. We wander\
  \ for a while, following the straight streets of the Jewish quarter, teeming with\
  \ people. By chance, we find ourselves in front of one of the most famous ruin bars\
  \ of the city: Szimpla Kert. Usually touristy, this time we are fortunate to be\
  \ there on a weekday, at a time evidently unappealing to tourists. Szimpla is absolutely\
  \ different from all that which can considered a \u2018pub\u2019 back home; it seems\
  \ more of an inception of venues with gardens hovering between one floor and another,\
  \ with stairs starting in one place, intertwining and then vanishing into improbable\
  \ corners. It\u2019s madness, and probably the countless beers that we have knocked\
  \ back which amplify this sense of vagueness, wonder and whimsy.  We return home\
  \ a bit altered, I and my friend I barely know. With great difficulty we put the\
  \ clean sheets on the dirty beds and we collapse as dead bodies do. \n\nThere, floating\
  \ on the bed is \"elsewhere, a negative mirror, to recognise the little that is\
  \ mine, discovering the much that I have not had and will never have\". All that\
  \ remains is saudade."
