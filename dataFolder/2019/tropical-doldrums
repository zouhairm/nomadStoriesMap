Text: "Dumbfounded by the colonial beauty of Antigua Guatemala, a deep solitude struck\
  \ my soul. For some reason, it felt like there had to be two of us there. \n \n\
  I strolled along the cobble streets alone, silently observing every corner. People\
  \ from all over the world visited the place every year, seduced by the city\u2019\
  s natural landscapes and unique architecture. \nSitting under the Arch of Santa\
  \ Catalina, I felt I belonged in this city. Greeted by people dressed in folklore,\
  \ tempted to buy fake jade and antiques, I was overwhelmed with excitement and a\
  \ desperate longing for venturing into this place. \n\nSuddenly, I realized how\
  \ lucky I was by being in Antigua. More than once before my arrival, I had near-death\
  \ experiences crossing the entire country on a motorcycle. \n\nHalf a week a before\
  \ arriving to Antigua, we crossed the heart of Guatemala. The first day was a warning\
  \ for us.\n \nIt was midnight and a storm trapped us somewhere in the Guatemalan\
  \ jungle. We found shelter in a little \u201Cpulperia\u201D and searched for the\
  \ nearest motel.\n I was travelling with my father all the way from the north of\
  \ Honduras to Lake Atitl\xE1n in Guatemala.  I was reluctant to venture across the\
  \ tropical jungle with motor-bikers from the very beginning of the trip. I didn\u2019\
  t trust my father, let alone his middle-age crisis friends. \n\nMy adventure-thirsty\
  \ free spirit was for the first time overwhelmed with emotions and preoccupied with\
  \ logistics. The jungles I knew so well from an early age were suddenly full of\
  \ danger and unfriendly invitations. The reason for this uncertainty and sharpness\
  \ of sense was rather profound: I had a place to go back to. \n\nMy fianc\xE9e at\
  \ the time awaited my return in Honduras. We were ready to start our life together\
  \ in Europe and marry a year afterward. That\u2019s enough to keep a man alive at\
  \ all costs. We walked for hours looking for a place until we found the most horrible\
  \ motel one could think of. \nAfter the storm, the sunrise announced a better future.\
  \ We were heading to Lake Atitl\xE1n and nothing would stop us now. \n\nOn the road,\
  \ the best photographs I had taken so far took place. Faces, begotten lands, spontaneous\
  \ interactions; all that makes us human captured by a lens.\n \nMy soul wandered\
  \ around the tropical mountains, quenching its thirst for freedom. The smell of\
  \ palm trees, the warmth of summer sun, 120 km/h, that\u2019s what freedom felt\
  \ like.\n\nWhen we finally arrived at the lake, a pair of girls approached me with\
  \ curiosity. I took a beautiful portrait of both of them. The mother, hesitating,\
  \ requested a photograph with her children. It was wonderful to experience the warmth\
  \ of honest human interaction. \n\nAfter lunch, we sailed across the lake and I\
  \ kept thinking of my beloved.  One would say: \u201CSuch a waste\u201D. Nonetheless,\
  \ anyone who has loved is aware of the beautiful simplicity found in such a state.\
  \  Being there, enjoying every moment, and, at the same time, feeling someone else\
  \ by your side you. \n\nIt was then that I was absolutely certain I loved her. When\
  \ everything I loved met in a single place and I still longed for home. \nAfter\
  \ Atitlan, we went to Antigua and were to stay there until our return to Honduras.\
  \ The old little city is by far my favorite place. It is a simple recollection of\
  \ everything I love: \nAntiques, tropical landscapes, colonial architecture, artistic\
  \ manifestations, high culture, and beautiful people.\n\nThe way back was worse\
  \ than our arrival: I almost broke a leg, we had a crash, and the bike ran out of\
  \ gas. But I didn\u2019t care... all I loved was back home and I couldn\u2019t wait\
  \ to grab my girl and kiss her forehead. Guatemala had blessed me with great adventure\
  \ and a harsh road. It was time for me to enjoy the quiet life.\n\nSome months after\
  \ this, I realized the trip was of the best in my life. \nAt some point, I thought\
  \ it was horrible but after losing the home I had longed for, I realize the worth\
  \ of these small breaks from everyday life. \n\nThe vastness of the tropic has no\
  \ comparison."
