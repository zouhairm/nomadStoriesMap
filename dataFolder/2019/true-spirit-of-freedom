Text: "Embarking on a personal journey of love and self discovery across the European\
  \ continent, one did not expect to stumble on a jewel, I personally dubbed as one\
  \ of Europe\u2019s hidden gem Portugal.\n\nNestled between the Atlantic sea and\
  \ the backdrops of Spain, Portugal offers a slightly warmer climate than most place\
  \ in Europe and believe me when I say as a South African it is highly appreciated.\
  \ Imagine yourself basking in warm waters of Algarve a popular destination for both\
  \ locals and tourists, which is completely well deserved. its 200km of pristine\
  \ clean beach offers a variety of entertainment, whether you  wish to bask in the\
  \ sun and catch up on some much needed rays (which aren\u2019t so much of a problem\
  \ for me, when I\u2019m all chocolate) or for the avid adventurer who seeks thrills\
  \ to keep the adrenaline pumping. This coastline has it all and did I mention it\
  \ was cheap?\n\nIf I didn\u2019t\u2026 you now know why I love it so much. Okay!\
  \ So maybe you aren\u2019t the beach material kind of girl or guy, Portugal has\
  \ you covered, if you are a history buff like me or a \u201Chonorary\u2019 food\
  \ blogger (unofficially) you will feel like you are drifting through heaven on the\
  \ streets of Lisbon, Portugal(Mind you that is the closest I ever want to get to\
  \ heaven currently, you can\u2019t blame me! Travelling is still very much enjoyable\
  \ and my journey has yet to begin) . The streets are so vibrant and easy to navigate,\
  \ everything is within walking distance; even if you feel like having a lazy Sunday\
  \ (trust me! You are going to appreciate this) you could always take a train which\
  \ is the common mode of transportation from one city to the next, navigating mountainous\
  \ regions to explore the age old towns or villages nestled amongst the rocks.\n\n\
  What does a hopeless romantic endeavor to do in the streets of Lisbon, where do\
  \ they go? They go to Castelo de S\xE3o Jorge a 11th century medieval castle, hoping\
  \ to catch a glimpse of ghost of the past or simply snag their very own James Bond.\n\
  \nWhen the sun sets and the crowds come out to play, who wouldn\u2019t want to be\
  \ on the streets of Porto to witness the fans go crazy as they  drag you along to\
  \ crowd the bars to catch the latest soccer fix of Porto or Benefica, local soccer\
  \ clubs participating in the la Liga, to those who are not soccer fans, la Liga\
  \ is equivalent to the UEFA champions league.\n\nDo you have a wife who like most\
  \ wives despise anything related to sports or to specific soccer (hint hint), why\
  \ not spoil her on a night out to taste the different wines found in the ancient\
  \ cities wine cellars located beneath the streets Porto, or unwind with a glass\
  \ of wine whilst watching the stars from the balcony of your hotel suite.\n\nOne\
  \ last thing you must remember the Portuguese people are very friendly so if you\
  \ need help or advice do not be afraid to ask and who knows? You might make a friend\
  \ or two. Stay safe, eat, love and travel to your hearts content in a country rich\
  \ with history and culture.\n\nBoa noite (translated as good evening/good night)."
