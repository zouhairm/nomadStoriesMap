Text: "It was my first time in Europe and I was visiting Marrakech with a few friends.\
  \ One of them was Jannis, from Germany, whom I had met many years ago in New Zealand\
  \ and we were reuniting again on this trip.\nAfter 3 or 4 days right in the middle\
  \ of the Medina, I had learnt how to make a turban out of my scarf, drank litters\
  \ of sweet tea with mint leaves and bargained for so many things in the markets,\
  \ that I didn\u2019t know how on earth was I going to fit it all in my backpack...\
  \ especially the camel skin pouf. \nAs an avid traveller, I wanted to know it all\
  \ about the city and we had already visited the main spots when Jannis said the\
  \ train station would probably be a colorful place for taking some pictures.\nOnce\
  \ we got there, I commented that I had always wanted to do like those characters\
  \ in the movies who buy a ticket to the unknown... or well, to the first destination\
  \ available. \u201CLet\u2019s do that\u201D Jannis said. And so we did, after calling\
  \ the rest of our friends to let them know we were going to be out for a day.\n\
  The first train was leaving to Casablanca in 10 minutes. We bought the tickets and\
  \ jumped into a pretty full wagon. The more we walked, the fuller it seemed to be.\
  \ \nI was about to sit on the floor along the street vendors, until we saw a lady\
  \ who waved at us and pointed towards two empty seats in front of her. I had learn\
  \ \u201CShukran\u201D was the Arabic word for thank you, so I did my best to pronounce\
  \ it right. Our new friend smiled with amusement and answer back \u201Cyou are welcome\u201D\
  \ in a perfect English. Her name was Amina and she looked different from the other\
  \ women I had met in Morocco so far, as she wasn\u2019t wearing a hiyab. After a\
  \ few minutes of small talk where I told her everything she wanted to know about\
  \ Argentina, I asked about the veil, as -I explained- in my ignorance of her culture\
  \ I thought all women had to wear it. She said that she was religious but it didn\xB4\
  t mean she was obliged to use it and that I would see the more I\u2018ll get to\
  \ know her country.\nWhen we told her that we were on our way to Casablanca, she\
  \ started to move her head from side to side and said something like: \u201CYou\
  \ are not going to like it. There is no much to see, apart from tall buildings and\
  \ pollution. It is just a business city with no romance like the in the Humphrey\
  \ Bogart movie. You should go to Mohammedia instead. Its a beautiful town by the\
  \ beach\u201D. I had never heard of such place but we took her advice anyways; after\
  \ all we were on an adventure and we were smart enough to know a local is always\
  \ right. \nAmina also recommended a place for us to stay, a hotel where her cousin\
  \ worked as a receptionist; so there we went on our arrival, two stops after Casablanca.\n\
  We found Nadia right away and as soon as we told her about Amina, she said her shift\
  \ was finishing and we should tag along to her place for dinner.\nWe didn\xB4t know\
  \ what to do, as this kindness was rare and unexpected, but she insisted.\nFifteen\
  \ minutes later, we were barefoot, sitting on sulky floor cushions,  with other\
  \ ten people who were offering drinks and delicious dishes that I had never tried\
  \ before. \nApart from Nadia and us, no one else spoke english, so they were all\
  \ doing their best to communicate with gestures to make us feel welcome. And that\xB4\
  s what I love the most when travelling; because I have learnt that being loving\
  \ human beings doesn\xB4t represent any culture in particular. Instead, it has a\
  \ lot to do with an individual will of opening your heart and give the best of yourself\
  \ to others, even to strangers, like we were that night."
