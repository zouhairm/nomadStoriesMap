Text: "The day starts out like most of our days during this trip. We wake up to light\
  \ rain in Bali that we are told will burn off by the early afternoon. The bustling\
  \ of the trees can be heard just outside our window. I look forward to our quiet,\
  \ easy mornings. Our room is one of half a dozen on this property, placed in between\
  \ lush trees and flower bushes, tiny streams, and stone walkways. The unique smell\
  \ of burning incense and flowers from the morning\u2019s offerings fill the air.\
  \ I hear this is the \u201CBali smell\u201D.\n\nOur walk from our room to the pool\
  \ takes us through these walkways, past buildings that are covered in delicate carvings\
  \ from floor to ceiling. We talk about our plans for the day over breakfast. It\
  \ is complimentary. This isn\u2019t your typical complimentary breakfast though.\
  \ I bet there would be higher turn outs at The Marriot if it was more like this.\
  \ No, this is a Bali breakfast; Ubud to be specific. Fresh juices and even fresher\
  \ fruit, warm banana crepes and Balinese coffee, a fried rice and egg dish called\
  \ Nasi Goreng, all made by the family who owns the property. \n\nThe family knows\
  \ some English. We make do mostly by pointing to things we\u2019d like to eat. We\
  \ ask them how to say \u201Cthank you very much\u201D in Balinese, terima kasih\
  \ (Tuh-REE-mah KAH-see). We use it often. Although, I first notice during our morning\
  \ routine that there is one commonality amongst both cultures that works well. A\
  \ universal language, if you will. \n\nWe ride through many little towns around\
  \ the island on a sturdy little scooter, becoming more and more fascinated with\
  \ this beautiful island. We grab some passion fruit and mangosteen from a fruit\
  \ stand on the side of a road, something we cannot get enough of. I notice it happens\
  \ again here; that universal language. It is helping everyone feel more comfortable.\
  \ \n\nWe make our way to the cascading terraces of the Tegalalang Rice Fields, stop\
  \ at the Luwak Coffee Plantation, and get lost looking at all of the goods in the\
  \ flea market we discovered. Each interaction we have tends to include more pointing\
  \ while trying to look up words on Google Translate with spotty cell service. Each\
  \ person is very patient with us. Terima kasih. But even so, everywhere we go, I\
  \ find that we do speak the same language even if the words are not the same. I\
  \ see it. I feel it. \n\nOn our way back to our room, we take an unexpected stop\
  \ to get an early dinner. At this point in the day, we are both fairly hungry and\
  \ realize we need to get something in our stomachs soon. My husband believes a stand-alone\
  \ building right off of the road is the place to go. Let\u2019s try it, I say. When\
  \ in Bali, right? \n\nThe dining area has three walls and a sliding door that is\
  \ wide open across the entire room; an indoor-outdoor seating situation. Connected\
  \ to this room is a tiny kitchen. There are two people inside. We believe it is\
  \ a mother and a daughter. They look happy to have visitors. We take a seat. It\
  \ doesn\u2019t take long for us to realize something. They do not speak any English.\
  \ This means more pointing at the menu and trying to pronounce names correctly.\
  \ It seems to work.\n\nMy husband decides he wants to see how they make their traditional\
  \ dishes. We do what we can to communicate we would like to watch them cook and\
  \ they welcome us into their kitchen. Laughing the whole time; mostly at us I am\
  \ sure. \n\nWe sit down to eat what soon becomes one of our favorite meals of the\
  \ trip. The open space watching people ride along the road, the breeze cooling us\
  \ down, the sweet smell of fresh food. It is perfect.\n\nAs we\u2019re finishing\
  \ up, I see a little girl peaking her head around the corner from the kitchen. She\
  \ has curious, bright eyes. I wave and we exchange the one piece of language we\
  \ all know so well. The one piece of language that connects us all: a smile."
