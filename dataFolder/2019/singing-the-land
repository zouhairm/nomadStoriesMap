Text: "I met her walking up a very steep hill, while deep in thought, well past Al-Khazneh\
  \ in the archeological treasure which is Petra, in Jordan. \nShe called out to me,\
  \ as I walked past and offered me a mint tea. \nSitting in the shade of their little\
  \ makeshift shop, I communicated with her Mum, a tiny woman who was sitting cross\
  \ legged on the corner of a frayed mat, as you often do when you have little shared\
  \ language, with a few words of greeting, smiles and gestures. \nMehedi was my age,\
  \ but the struggles and disappointments of a lifetime were clearly etched on her\
  \ face, making her look much older.\nManil's face bore no such lines. She had a\
  \ bubbly personality and her step and voice had an upward lilt. Her English was\
  \ impeccable, with a slight American accent, the result of lifetime spent talking\
  \ to tourists.\nI learned a little about their life. Mehedi was a widow with six\
  \ sons. She walked ten kilometres each day with her donkey to sell tourists mint\
  \ tea. Manil her only daughter, had been the main breadwinner for the family for\
  \ most of her young life. As a baby she was so outgoing and photogenic that tourists\
  \ often offered to pay to have a photo taken with her.  \nWhen Manil and Mehedi\
  \ learned that  my heritage was Italian, they told me of one son who they hadn't\
  \ seen since he had married an Italian girl and moved to Florence ten years earlier.\n\
  I was going to Florence the following week, so I took some photos of them both,\
  \ thinking I could give them to Solomon. Manil was supposed to give me his contact\
  \ details but somehow it didn't happen. \nBefore I left, I asked Manil about a good\
  \ place to watch the sunrise the following morning. She answered without hesitation.\
  \ \n\"Come to my village tonight and I'll take you. My family are Bedouins and live\
  \ in the desert. The sunrise is beautiful from there.\"\nIt was an adventure finding\
  \ Manil that night, but at 3am the next morning, I was walking behind her, past\
  \ the last houses of her small village, and a few angry guard dogs, up a narrow\
  \ pathway and into the spaciousness and darkness of the endless desert. I was feeling\
  \ grateful and excited. \nIt was cloudy and yet Manil stepped confidently along\
  \ the track, occasionally flicking on a small lighter and adjusting her course.\
  \ \nI was struck by the beauty and depth of the silence, broken only occasionally\
  \ by a now distant barking dog.\nWithout warning Manil starting singing, a strangely\
  \ sad melody drifted slowly out into the night. \nIt seemed to be one part of a\
  \ conversation, an invitation to reply, but the silence and my awe was its only\
  \ response. \nAnd we walked like that, an older woman and a young girl, companions\
  \ in a shared experience, that seemed strangely familiar. \nConnected across culture,\
  \ age and time with an ancient song that touched my soul, reminded me of another\
  \ walk, in another desert, in the remote north of Western Australia.\nAn Aboriginal\
  \ Elder walking me through his country, singing his land. \nThe sunrise was amazing.\
  \ Breakfast a simple meal cooked up over an open fire by her gran was pure deliciousness.\
  \ \nI found Solomon, in Florence the following week, after going to three markets\
  \ and having the whole community help me in my quest, because I only had his first\
  \ name and a story and a handful of photos, and the odds of finding him were not\
  \ high. \nHe was visibly moved when he saw the photos of his family and I was happy.\n\
  If I close my eyes right now, I can still hear Manil's sweet voice, singing me her\
  \ land."
