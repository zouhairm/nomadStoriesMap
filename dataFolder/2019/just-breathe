Text: "Diffused around the edges, a bit faded, and utterly intriguing. The caricaturized\
  \ faces, done in black ink on stone slabs, stared at me as I trekked uphill to the\
  \ Gakwonsa Temple in Cheonan, South Korea. I stepped off the road and paused to\
  \ examine the faces and imagine their identities: a solemn grandfather, a persnickety\
  \ great-uncle, an average dad, a fun uncle, a kind businessman, and a playful mom.\
  \ Whoever they were, their portraits composed a stone shrine formed in a mountainside.\
  \ An altar supported offerings like porcelain dolls to accompany the spirits. On\
  \ a slab that did not feature a face, someone had carved a Korean flag and a couple\
  \ Hangul symbols. A family name, perhaps. \n\nI had been living in South Korea for\
  \ a month. I wanted to learn the language, see all the country had to offer, and\
  \ immerse myself in the culture. My demanding teaching gig and never-ending upper\
  \ respiratory infection (a gift from the smog) posed major roadblocks. My plan,\
  \ then, was to start small and inch toward my goals. I knew about Gakwonsa and its\
  \ big Buddha statue from previous online research, and the estimated travel time\
  \ from my studio apartment to the temple was under an hour, so away I went with\
  \ a camera and modest expectations in hand.  \n\nAdmiring the offbeat roadside shrine,\
  \ I understood how it was a physical manifestation of the importance and respect\
  \ Koreans place on family. I also thought the faces served as a not-so-subtle reminder\
  \ for passersby to pay respects to and connect with their ancestry. I also thought\
  \ the world would be a better place if there were more artistic renditions of people\
  \ made in unexpected places. Off to the side of the cartoonish faces I saw an entrance\
  \ to a modest prayer cavern, containing a Buddha statue, incense in vases and a\
  \ kneeling pillow, carved into the mountainside. The image of this space stayed\
  \ with me as I continued my journey to the temple and inspired me to come up with\
  \ cheesy adages like \u201CCarve out moments for reflection in the rock that is\
  \ your daily obligations.\u201D Tranquil instrumental music interrupted my musings\
  \ and signaled I had reached my destination. \n\nThe main temple rivaled any European\
  \ cathedral I had visited in terms of intricacy, art and amount of gold leaf used.\
  \ The Buddha statue, striking and soothing, lived up to my expectations. Sandalwood\
  \ incense burned and blanketed the premises in a warm, comforting scent. But the\
  \ canopies of paper lanterns in blues, pinks, reds, golds and greens swaying in\
  \ the afternoon breeze at the entrance to the compound moved me more. Hung in preparation\
  \ for the Buddha\u2019s Birthday, the lanterns had attached at their bottoms tiny\
  \ papers on which people had written their prayers or wishes. This shared expression\
  \ of hope sparked a flickering of hope in me, too.  \n\nIn addition to welcoming\
  \ visitors and worshippers to the temple complex, the Buddha statue sits at the\
  \ base of a trail that ascends Mount Taejosan. The initial incline is steep, and\
  \ as I began to hike, I felt a small strain in my lungs from the altitude and the\
  \ respiratory infection. But soon contentment overcame me. CCTV cameras were nowhere\
  \ to be found, and the trees provided a natural barrier to the smog. Conical sculptures\
  \ made from stacked up pebbles lined the trail and provided an odd but welcome presence.\
  \ Buddha statues appeared sporadically off the path, and I perched to take a break\
  \ near one on a ledge overlooking the lower trail. Surrounded by nothing but the\
  \ sounds of nature, I did what Gakwonsa suggested I do: meditate. \n\nI lasted three\
  \ more months in Korea, but spending time at and around the temple compound was\
  \ a moment of clarity in the fog. My daytrip to Gakwonsa gave me space to reflect,\
  \ to reconnect with myself, and, in spite of my upper respiratory issues, to breathe."
