Text: "During October of 2017, I did my first Eurotrip alone with a group of people\
  \ that I\u2019ve never seen in my life. I had the feeling that I would be the only\
  \ Brazilian there and I was not trusting my English skills at all. It was a 12 days\
  \ trip around 8 countries and I already knew it was going to be a rush. But at least\
  \ I would see lots of the places of my bucket list. What I didn\u2019t expect was\
  \ that I would find love in the middle of the way. The first interaction with the\
  \ group was in Amsterdam in a cruise tour through the canals. At this point, I was\
  \ really the only Brazilian along with other 10 nationalities. I needed to go to\
  \ the toilet and I met this guy. He said I could go first. We left the boat together\
  \ and started talking. He was from Australia. He said that he knew a word in Portuguese.\
  \ I laughed. We arrived in Munique and soon we were doing a walking tour and he\
  \ was by my side again. The end of the night was in a nightclub where the kiss finally\
  \ happened. Innsbruck was in the itinerary of the next day. When we started going\
  \ up to the Alps everything started to be white. That moment probably I would define\
  \ as the most amazing one of the trip. It was real snow. Let me mention that we\
  \ don't have snow in Brazil and yes, I had seen snow once before but not that much\
  \ snow. Not that white. I was about to cry of happiness. I won't ever forget that\
  \ moment. On the way back to the city, he got the same gondola as me and he found\
  \ out a way of hugging me and my heart was warm. In Florence, he said that in 7\
  \ weeks he would be in Brazil. I was really scared of the way things were going.\
  \ We had a romantic dinner in Lucerne, just the two of us and away from all the\
  \ group and I agreed about trying a long distance relationship.  In Paris, we were\
  \ on the first floor of the Eiffel Tower when it started shining in a cold night\
  \ and we kissed. I was living my dream and as fast as I could realize we already\
  \ had spent all the time we had. It was hard to say goodbye - or see you soon -\
  \ and I couldn't stop crying. It was the end of the best experience of my life and\
  \ it was way more than visiting all that places. It was laughs, exploring different\
  \ cities, barely sleep, spending time on the bus with all the different people and\
  \ nationalities, parties and also It was the love that I didn't expect finding.\
  \ He really ended up going to Brazil in 7 weeks from that day. 1 year and 1 month\
  \ after the start of this relationship he broke up with me. November of 2018 I was\
  \ at Heathrow airport, but to go back home with nothing else planned. I was lost.\
  \ All my dreams that I never confessed to anyone. He went to the airport with me.\
  \ There were so much love and pain on that day. We both were so sad. He changed\
  \ my life. He made me question lots of stuff, what I like and what I dislike. Why\
  \ don't I leave my comfort zone? Why don\u2019t I leave Brazil and live in Australia?\
  \ Why am I so afraid of following my dreams? Unfortunately, I wasn't prepared to\
  \ leave everything behind and focus on me. I was too scared of this new reality\
  \ he showed me. It has been dark times without him, but I\u2019m so grateful of\
  \ that journey. The memories we created. After all of that, I have to say to you\
  \ that travel is not only about places and pictures, is about people we connect\
  \ and disconnect, is about open your eyes to the new. The Eiffel Tower, the Snow,\
  \ Munique, Lucerne all of these places become memories of love. If I can tell you\
  \ one more thing: don\u2019t be afraid! Just go!"
