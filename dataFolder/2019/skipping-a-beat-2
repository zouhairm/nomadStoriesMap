Text: "I taste the salt rolling down the dry skin of my sunburnt cheeks. The eggshell\
  \ white paint of Le\xF3n's Cathedral rooftop succeeds in blinding me, causing me\
  \ to briefly lose my attention span. I squeeze my eyes shut, to clear my view. My\
  \ bare feet burn on the 814-year-old rooftop.\n\nI look towards the direction of\
  \ the tour guide's broken English and center in on what he is saying, \u201Cand\
  \ here we have\u2026\u201D I notice the white Christmas sweatshirt he is wearing\
  \ in Nicaragua's 100-degree spring weather while he is explaining the Basilica\u2019\
  s seven tombs deep beneath us. It\u2019s a bittersweet transcendent moment getting\
  \ lost in the beauty of the chestnut-copper tinted rooftops beyond the white spires\
  \ of the Cathedral in the scorching heat.\n\nIt led to vast thoughts, a prominent\
  \ one being as to why I was here in culture-saturated Nicaragua. It isn\u2019t every\
  \ day that you get to travel to a different country, and for a mission trip at that.\
  \ The mere idea of helping those in need, whether that be physical or spiritual,\
  \ seemed truly appealing. Peering out at the multi-colored buildings and vibrant\
  \ streets below, I perceived the happy demeanors of the citizens: people, pleasantly\
  \ living out their lives on the outside, but perhaps, on the inside, carrying around\
  \ their pain just like any of us. It made me realize that all people need is for\
  \ someone to listen, for someone to show that they care, for someone to prove that\
  \ they\u2019re not alone. The sisters, with whom we were with in Le\xF3n, truly\
  \ humbled themselves, showing us what it\u2019s truly like giving all of yourself\
  \ to others, humbling oneself, not only by feeding the poor, but also by washing\
  \ others\u2019 feet as a sign of love.\n\nAfter exploring the heart of the city,\
  \ we piled in the back of rusty trucks to get to a small village north of Somotillo.\
  \ The air tasted like dirt. A gathering in the cerulean church down the road greeted\
  \ us. A crowd of kids interspersed with chickens aggregated and marveled at \u2018\
  the travelers\u2019. The occasional hand ran through my pale hair and I heard the\
  \ whispered \u201Cprincesa\u201D being mumbled. I felt the warmth of a small hand\
  \ slip into mine and a sweet face glanced at me, showing me a heartwarming smile.\
  \ \u201CQuieres caminar con ustedes?\u201D I asked her. Her pigtails jumped slightly\
  \ as she nodded yes, I do want to walk with you. She was a character, climbing trees\
  \ to have us try the exotic fruit and introducing us to her exuberant friends.\n\
  \nOne morning, the smell of baking bread and the sound of the ardent fire woke me\
  \ up at 6 am. As I sat up, I saw someone in the shadows standing above me. My heart\
  \ lurched forward, not knowing who it was. The silhouette stepped forward and I\
  \ realized that it\u2019s the girl from yesterday, Leslie. She giggled and sat on\
  \ my sleeping bag, marveling at how soft it was.\n\nLiving among the people: eating\
  \ what they ate, going where they went, sleeping like they slept, truly became an\
  \ eye-opener. We wen\xADt house to house, visiting with the people, offering our\
  \ time and our thoughts. There were moments when some of them broke down and all\
  \ we could do was to hold their shaking bodies and console them with the few Spanish\
  \ words that made sense to us.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just those living there. It was\
  \ \u2018we\u2019, twelve students from all over the US who met just the day before,\
  \ not knowing the group or what the week held, that heightened the experience. We\
  \ were all vastly different, except for having the same desire to give and to love.\
  \ That\u2019s what brought us together and what let the experience thrive. It\u2019\
  s what let us learn to become one within the society of another culture. As we all\
  \ sang together to \u201CTel\xE9fono\u201D, I couldn\u2019t help but look around\
  \ and take in everyone\u2019s thrill; reflecting that among the miles we walked\
  \ that week, there wasn\u2019t a moment that wasn\u2019t worthy of causing my heart\
  \ to skip a beat."
