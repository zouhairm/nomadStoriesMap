Text: "As I hurriedly got into the bus which was supposed to take me up to the famed\
  \ hill station of Darjeeling I grew anxious with apprehensive excitement. Would\
  \ it really be like what the old nepali lady at the railway station said it would\
  \ ?\nWild orchids and waterfalls.\nSnowy mountains so close they seem within your\
  \ grasp ?\nAs our bus climbed onto snaking routes cut into the mountain side like\
  \ an old wound that the mountains had recauterised with dense vegetation\u2019s\
  \ almost so you could hardly see the roads ahead I thought to myself maybe this\
  \ would be worth it after all. We went by scenery I didn\u2019t  know existed in\
  \ what you would normally associate with India. The only colour added to the dense\
  \ green hills were the splattering of spring flowers sprinkled all over the hills.\
  \ The tea gardens let off an intense sweet earthy smell fresh after the early morning\
  \ sprinkle the hills had received. I felt in a daze, nature sure has her own way\
  \ of defying odds as we crossed a grotto overgrown to such an extent you could barely\
  \ see baby Jesus peeking out from behind the foliage. An old folk saying \u201C\
  The hills will defy you every chance they get\u201D seemed all the more true as\
  \ I saw a waterfall grow right on the highway with no care of the asphalt road the\
  \ passing vehicles, splashing and splashing. Gurgling it\u2019s way down to the\
  \ plains below. We reached Tiger hill Darjeeling by early morning as the first rays\
  \ of dawn were about to break, in the densest of fogs where one can barely see ones\
  \ outstretched arms. A small girl heavily clad in yak fur and tribal woollens her\
  \ smal face pierced by the darkest night black eyes I have seen, her cheeks red\
  \ as the tea she held out in the hopes I would buy it from her. I smiled down at\
  \ her and her face instantly lit up and as I took the tea behind her the dog gave\
  \ way to the most breathtaking view I have seen. The sky was a shade from the warmest\
  \ palette streaked across the sky and Mt Kanchenjunga stood white, stoic, calm.\
  \ Oh how small you felt gazing up across the ravine. How surreal that dense clouds\
  \ were beneath where I stood. As the sky turned orange from the pink at breaking\
  \ dawn everything else at that point of time felt irrelevant. The sky was still\
  \ speckled with the thousand of stars that had kept me company through my journey\
  \ up here. I felt humbled by the vastness of it all. How small of a speck were we\
  \ in this universe ? As i stood there drinking in the sight before me, the cold\
  \ didn\u2019t really bother me anymore. My tea from the child warmed me to my deepest\
  \ core. I suddenly remembered I had to pay her for it and turned to look for her.\
  \ I found her behind me fiddling with her coat. I reached into my pocket and gave\
  \ her a few coins and it was then she asked if I wanted a picture of her with her\
  \ yak and puppy. I definitely did so I followed to where her tiny fingers pointed\
  \ around the bend and came across a world weary beautiful animal covered in blankets\
  \ though his fur definitely didn\u2019t need it. She reached into her pocket and\
  \ brought out a tiny puppy the size of her palm and deftly climbed onto the yak\
  \ holding her puppy closely turned to me with her bright smile and piercing eyes\
  \ and demanded to be photographed to which I complied happily. I stood with her,\
  \ her puppy and yak and looked out to The Valley. The clouds beneath us gave way\
  \ to reveal the plains below us far away with silver winding streaks across it which\
  \ I gathered were rivers that must have started from those tiny waterfalls that\
  \ didn\u2019t know human boundaries and didn\u2019t care about logistics, who went\
  \ where their force drove them and I wished I would be more like them to live this\
  \ life to my fullest. To go where life took me, to enjoy every view the day provided."
