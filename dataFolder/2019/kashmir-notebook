Text: "Anywhere you go in Srinagar, Indians are always them, India, always yours,\
  \ you, always a non-Kashmiri, until you ask, masla kya hai \u2013 a question that\
  \ opens the gates of belonging. There\u2019s anger in the voice of a Kashmiri against\
  \ India \u2013 the governments, law and order, the force \u2013 nothing really,\
  \ as far as I observed, against the Indians.\n\n\u2018I have no education, am not\
  \ answerable to anyone - can be easily brainwashed into taking the gun \u2013 but\
  \ how will you justify a lecturer, an engineer, a doctor who earns in lacs, deciding\
  \ to leave a life and become a militant\u2019 the old man, a chaiwala, handed me\
  \ a glass of tea. \u2018Whenever you come across a statue of Bhagat Singh, you stand\
  \ there saluting him\u2019 he imitated an army man's salute several times, \u2018\
  Bose set-up his own fauj to fight for your freedom \u2013 go check the British records,\
  \ these men would be labeled as terrorists... here they are martyrs, why?\u2019\
  \ he demanded answers, brows in a frown, gaze piercing, \u2018because they fought\
  \ for a cause \u2013 wajah \u2013 and when our kids pick the gun, we have our own\
  \ wajah \u2013 we have suffered a lot, our children have died \u2013 but our fight\
  \ will continue\u2019 he said.\n\nLater, naming a separatist leader, he called him\
  \ a dog. \u2018The militants are after the chair too - nobody's fighting for our\
  \ cause \u2013 we don\u2019t really want to separate from here \u2013 actually,\
  \ we want neither India, nor Pakistan, we only want our peace \u2013 you\u2019re\
  \ here to listen to the people of Kashmir \u2013 know why we battle guns with stones'\
  \ he said, justifying their war-cry, handing me a cup of chai and biscuits without\
  \ being asked for.\n\nWhen I got up to leave, chacha refused to take any money.\
  \ Instead, he pulled me into a hug, 'you're my son \u2013 come back sooner, and\
  \ write the truth', he said. I paced back with heavy eyes and heavier heart - I\
  \ wasn't meant to belong.\n\nAn autowala worked my local guide to the city - he\
  \ lived in the downtown Srinagar, which helped because he took me around various\
  \ 'non-touristy' spots - the dargahs and Sufi-shrines. As we walked around the local\
  \ markets, I asked him the possibility of militants and informers being around us.\
  \ 'Immense' he said with a hideous smile - making me a little wary of him.\n\nLater,\
  \ he shared his perspective. 'They keep saying that the army is bad, the AFSPA should\
  \ be removed - but we should be thankful that there are so many army men in the\
  \ state.' Wherever you are in Srinagar, you will always spot scores of gun-clad\
  \ army men patrolling the city - and it's strange, the co-existence of guns and\
  \ lives so casual, it is as if everybody has gotten used to everything, and when\
  \ the day would finally arrive - when guns leave the state - I wonder if the lives\
  \ would actually miss this cage of sorts - it's a whimsical idea, but humans get\
  \ used to things - good and bad - pretty quick. 'We are farmers' he continued, 'and\
  \ most of our supplies reach the army - once they are gone, you'd witness a rise\
  \ in unemployment, the money would be gone.\u2019\n\nLater in the evening, as we\
  \ drove to a place where they buried those who lost their lives in exchanges against\
  \ the army - militants, and civilians - he told me, 'Yesterday, a civilian was killed\
  \ in an area nearby. While he was being buried here, and we ran through our prayers,\
  \ this is where the army shot pellet guns at us from' he said as I looked around\
  \ at children playing cricket - in less than 24 hours, life had gotten back to usual,\
  \ 'you'll find four shots of pellet guns on my back' he smiled. Pellets are infamous\
  \ for making the locals blind.\n\nBegunah. Benaseeb. He remarked as we walked around\
  \ the graves. He pointed at one with a black tombstone, 'this is my brother - he\
  \ was a militant, killed in 2002. My family and I were kept in the Central Jail\
  \ for 6 years. My sister was only 9 then' his hideous smile intact. 'They trouble\
  \ us sometimes, but it's okay.'"
