Text: "The fierce sun in the sky, never looked calmer. As though the Himalayas next\
  \ to it was telling it to calm down. Birds doing their chores never seem more delighted\
  \ than that day. \nMy feet aching with the pain of walking for hours had a rush\
  \ of blood through them. I told myself again and again that the destination is near\
  \ and soon the pain would stop. I looked my dad walking next to me, he smiled through\
  \ his old wrinkles giving me an encourgement to go on.\n\"How much longer, Pa?\"\
  \n\"Not so long\".\n\" Its starting to get dark\", I panicked.\n\"Lets find a village\
  \ to spend the night, alright?\" he said.\nJust then, a lady with a child on her\
  \ passed us like a zooming car.\n\"Excuse me, can u give us some water?\" my Dad\
  \ asked.\nShe looked at us first shocked and then smiled and said,\" Where are you\
  \ headed to?\"\n\"Annapurna\", Dad replied.\n\"Well, that is pretty far. Do you\
  \ have a place to spend the night/\"\n\"Well not yet.\"\n\"it is getting pretty\
  \ dark\"\nThen she looked at me and asked,\" Hungry?\"\nI nodded.\n\"Here\". She\
  \ gave us this big bag of popcorn and a glass of water.\nI almost cried with joy.\n\
  \" The village is pretty far from here but I if you walk with me at a faster pace\
  \ we will reach the village soon.\"\n\"I see. No, thank you. We will set out a tent.\"\
  \n\"Alright.\" She left.\nI was so delighted by the encounter and the food. We set\
  \ out a tent that night.\nWe reached the village the next day around noon. My dad\
  \ were delighted but the only thought that crossed my mind was well that woman could\
  \ walk fast."
