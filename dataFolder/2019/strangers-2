Text: "Incredible India are not just the words but emotion. Likewise, i went to a\
  \ small but beautiful travelling trip with brothers to Dharmshala a small part of\
  \ Himachal. Its all covered with beautiful scenery. \nJumping over to my story,\
  \ it was awesome i think because i think when you travel it is just you to yourself\
  \ no matter who else is with you.\nWe left for the place in the morning with a DsLr\
  \ and with full excitement. The atmosphere was so awesome that day it was all cloudy\
  \ and generous. It all started when we enterrd into the hilly area of himachal and\
  \ that green environment with dusty look of snake roads. We then stopped at one\
  \ place at the roadside it was a small stall and it just had a stell roof and chips\
  \ packets were scattered on the table and then there was a tree byside and the most\
  \ sweet thing was that it was mango tree and then we purchased some bund and chips\
  \ from the store and threw some stones on bramches to have some juice mangoes. \n\
  Thereafter the clouds turned itself into running clouds and showers started. It\
  \ was the most beautiful natural thing happened at the right time. Now Dharamshalla\
  \ was few minutes away and when we reached there the first thing i saw was kids\
  \ dancing in rain and we couldnt resist to go nd join them so we went off the car\
  \ and had a good time and we parked our car at the motel and took some rest and\
  \ made a plan for our exploring there.\nWe reached there in noon till evening we\
  \ had our lunch snacks of different kinds which include israel, nepali and punjabi\
  \ food. Then we thought of going with the plan but trips are planned but the exploring.\
  \ We saw some stairs going on a hill in the night it was beautiful as it was all\
  \ glown with white light on the sides and it was zigzag order. We stepped to it\
  \ and we went just few stairs up and we found some nice israeli group there enjoying\
  \ with the songs on their speaker, we made some noise passing by and then i myself\
  \ felt to intiate and create the moment. I indulge mylself into them. We then had\
  \ some drinks together as they offered us a meal few more stairs up at a beautiful\
  \ restaurant covered in golden lights in the \nnights. We enjoyed a lot and share\
  \ some our experiences with them they shared theirs and then we logged off and shake\
  \ hands and then back to our rooms and the next day was our trek to triund which\
  \ was above the clouds and we camped there and had some fun with other strangers\
  \ camping have food enjoyed guitar music there danced a lot and clicked few pictures\
  \ but made more memories and then we woke up in the morning watch the beautiful\
  \ nature around us above the clouds and the changing colours and the sunset it was\
  \ all beautiful that i cannot explain. I would love to travel across the whole world\
  \ now with pure feeling and maybe this could a chance for me to make it happen."
