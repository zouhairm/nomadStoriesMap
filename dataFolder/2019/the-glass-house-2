Text: "My guide, Andrea\u2014whom I\u2019d hired through my travel agent back in New\
  \ York\u2014pulled up outside Budapest\u2019s Corinthia Hotel right on time. She\
  \ poked her head out the window of her compact white car. \u201CRosey, yes?\u201D\
  \ she said.\nSeat-buckling into the passenger seat, I handed her my typed list.\
  \ \u201CI know we already spoke by email, but I\u2019ve updated my list. Here, take\
  \ a look.\u201D  \nShe scanned the paper, smiling, nodding her head. I had done\
  \ my research well. I knew exactly which places I wanted to visit. This trip, my\
  \ first to Hungary and Slovakia, was part recreation, part pilgrimage, and my perfectly\
  \ curated list reflected that: generic tourist attractions and places that held\
  \ personal meaning for me, a grandchild of Holocaust survivors who\u2019d had roots\
  \ in Hungary and Slovakia for generations. It included Budapest\u2019s Parliament\
  \ building and the Jewish cemetery in Ludany where my namesake was buried; a boat\
  \ ride on the Danube and the synagogue in Debrecen where my great-grandfather had\
  \ prayed for years.\n But when Andrea handed me back the list, she said, \u201C\
  I\u2019ll take you to the glass house. We have time.\u201D\n\u201CWait, what?\u201D\
  \ There was no glass house on my list. I pictured a modern structure, an exotic\
  \ palace made of glass, a glass maze where one might wander in circles, glass sculptures\u2026\
  . \u201CWhat\u2019s the glass house? A tourist attraction?\u201D\nAndrea shifted\
  \ the car into gear. \u201CYou\u2019ll like it. It fits with your list,\u201D was\
  \ her cryptic comment, and off we went. \nThe glass house, at 29 Vadasz Street,\
  \ looked nothing like the exotic palace I\u2019d envisioned. Its fa\xE7ade was grey,\
  \ nondescript, not dissimilar from the other houses on the street. To enter it,\
  \ we walked down a narrow alley, turned right, and found ourselves at a grey door\
  \ adorned by one yellow star.\n\u201CAh, the Holocaust?\u201D I asked. \nBut Andrea\
  \ didn\u2019t reply. She knocked, and a young woman, the sole employee of the Glass\
  \ House Memorial Museum, opened the door. As I entered the single room that comprised\
  \ the museum, I had no inkling\u2014certainly nothing about this place\u2019s appearance\
  \ portended it\u2014that of all the places I would visit on this trip, the evocative\
  \ gravesites, the history-imbued synagogues, the memorials drenched with measureless\
  \ tears, this quiet, unremarkable house would be what would touch me most.\nBefore\
  \ WWII, the Glass House had been a wholesale glass dealership owned by Arthur Weiss.\
  \ Its spectacular showroom included samples of gorgeous glass styles, many built\
  \ into the walls, floor tiles, fixtures, and even the stairs. Lajos Kozma, a renowned\
  \ modernist architect, had designed the building in the early 1930s and created\
  \ a magnificent fa\xE7ade made entirely of white sheet glass. \nAnd yet, it wasn\u2019\
  t for the building\u2019s former grandeur that Andrea had brought me here. \u201C\
  I must tell you about Carl Lutz,\u201D she said. And in the next hour I learned\
  \ about Lutz, a Swiss diplomat who'd used brains, diplomacy, courage, and most of\
  \ all, humanity, to execute an incredible operation in this glass house, saving\
  \ thousands of Hungarian Jews from death.\nLater, back in the States, I would read\
  \ every article and book about Lutz I could find; I\u2019d discover that my next-door\
  \ neighbor had been saved through Lutz in this glass house!; and I would speak to\
  \ Lutz\u2019s surviving daughter, Agnes Hirschi, who told me how she gives talks\
  \ all over the world to keep her father\u2019s memory alive. \nBut as I stood there\
  \ in the humble room that held no physical trace of its former splendor, as I listened\
  \ to the soft, accented English of the house\u2019s sole employee, I felt, in my\
  \ very marrow, all the history and fear and sadness embedded in this space. Here\
  \ was my ancestry. Here lay my roots. That my grandparents might have never stepped\
  \ into the glass house was irrelevant. My story is the story of all the men, women,\
  \ and children who had lived here for months. Their story is the story of my family\u2019\
  s prayers in Debrecen\u2019s synagogue and my ancestors lying in the earth of Ludany.\
  \ All of it was intertwined.\nIn this house, I discovered something. I learned something.\
  \ I felt something. And isn\u2019t that the very reason we travel?"
