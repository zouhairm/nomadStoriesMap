Text: "The alarm rang. It was 6 AM. I was traveling to Gangtok that morning. I was\
  \ excited. The train was scheduled for departure from Guwahati station at 9.15 AM.\
  \ I had packed everything already the previous night so it was a stress free morning\
  \ for me. Then I ate a light breakfast and got ready. I reached the station at 8\
  \ AM. \n\nI was on board. The train began to move. The journey began. I began to\
  \ visualize how the journey would go. I sat near the window as it was my favourite\
  \ spot while traveling. A family of three joined me. When I looked outside the window,\
  \ I saw trees and distant fields drift away. I crossed one station after another.\
  \ I reached the Siliguri railway station at 2 in the afternoon. It was crowded with\
  \ people swarming all over the station. I had to drop off at the station as the\
  \ only way to reach Gangtok was by roadways. I booked a taxi and started my road\
  \ trip to Gangtok. The roads were zig zag and surrounded by plenty of trees on both\
  \ sides. After traveling a few miles a beautiful river came to my sight. I was in\
  \ awe at what I saw. The river made the scenery even more picturesque. \n\nAfter\
  \ traveling for almost two hours continuously without stops I reached Gangtok, the\
  \ capital of Sikkim. It was a charming city on top of a hill. It was raining heavily\
  \ when I arrived. People were running to and fro in order to save themselves from\
  \ the heavy rain. I waited for the rain to calm down. Then I searched for a hotel.\
  \ To my surprise, I found a beautiful and cozy room with a lovely view of the city\
  \ from my window.\n\nOne of the most astonishing things I noticed about the city\
  \ was the weather. It changed very quickly. Once there was sunshine, then the next\
  \ moment there was heavy rain. The clouds drifted low as if you could almost touch\
  \ them. The next morning I woke up to the beautiful view from my window. I ate a\
  \ hearty breakfast and went to explore the city. \n\nThe streets of the city were\
  \ very clean. I went to one of the biggest markets in Gangtok. I was fascinated\
  \ by the market. I have never seen such a busy market before. The shopkeepers were\
  \ constantly chatting with the customers. I kept walking through the maze of the\
  \ city. I wanted to get lost. When I entered into the deeper part of the city, I\
  \ saw lots of monks. They were busy buying vegetables. I also noticed that there\
  \ were lots of monasteries nearby. I went to one of the monasteries where I was\
  \ enchanted by the peacefulness of the place. It was like I was in a different part\
  \ of the world where all the noises of the other world were blocked. The grandiosity\
  \ of the monastery humbled me.\n\nTo conclude, I would say Gangtok is one of the\
  \ best places to visit for both families and young people. It offers a lot of opportunities\
  \ for sightseeing. The nightlife although it's not like a metropolitan city, the\
  \ city of Gangtok offers breathtaking views at night. It is a very clean city with\
  \ lots of friendly people. Monks are an everyday attraction here. As the main religion\
  \ here is Buddhism, you can see a lot of monasteries too spread all over the region.\
  \ It is also one of the reason why its very calm and peaceful around here. The crime\
  \ rates are extremely low. People are very generous and helpful to each other. Also,\
  \ if you love hiking, then this is the place to be. With high mountains and hills,\
  \ it offers an amazing hiking experience. If you're planning a visit to Gangtok\
  \ then the ideal time would be between March to September. The winter gets very\
  \ cold out here. The living costs are also moderate and very affordable. Anyone\
  \ planning of visiting Gangtok should definitely go for it. It is worth a visit."
