Text: "Not here nor there, really, anywhere \nbefore we came to you \nI venture to\
  \ find what is true \nwhat is new \n\nComing here I thought I'd find \na degree\
  \ a lesson, maybe something divine \ninstead heartache, questions, \na life not\
  \ recognized as mine \n\never growing ever changing\nentrancing a few \n\nwhere\
  \ did i go you ask?\nto the depths of my mind \nin a deep depression\nall has not\
  \ been fine \n\ni ascend upon this journey time and time again \nwith a map, and\
  \ a compass \nbroken, unsure of this land \n\nwhat is self inflicted?\nis it all\
  \ out of my control?\n\nThese questions I ask of any soul \n\nI dropped Acid once\
  \ \nit was in January, a particularly mild winter that year\n\nI sat across from\
  \ my, at the time, dear friend \nshe coached me through the process\n\"place the\
  \ tab on your tongue and let it melt\"\nshe told me it would take a little while\
  \ for it to hit\n\nI'm not sure if it took a while to hit, \nor just took a while\
  \ for me to realize I was, indeed, trippin balls \n\ntypically, the feedback I've\
  \ gotten about others' acid experience: is that of visual stimulation \nthings move\
  \ or something \nfor me, everything was crystal clear\nnot just what I was seeing\
  \ in the physical world, but in my mind as well\nevery synapse was firing \nevery\
  \ dendrite sending information\nmy young mind, eager to interpret it all\n\nI recall\
  \ watching a birthing video \nmy altered state of mind then interpreted sex as being\
  \ the intimate relation that it is \nA BABY CAN COME FROM THIS SHIT!\nI clearly\
  \ knew that beforehand, but it finally sunk in \nmaybe it was the screaming woman\
  \ and stretching vagina, but I swore Abstinence after that\nnot that I have many\
  \ suitors, so it's not a difficult lifestyle for me to maintain \nwith the occasional\
  \ cheat night.\n\nit was about 33 degrees out that night, a warm night for January\n\
  There was a heavy snow fall \nwhite flecks fell slow \nat 4 in the morning we were\
  \ the first to put our prints on the fresh white sheet \n\nI could have sworn I\
  \ saw Jack Frost that night \n\nIt's really hard to come to terms with the fact\
  \ that you are mentally \"disabled\" \nLol what \n\nI mean I think my brain works\
  \ just fine \nSure, I'm usually always going 1000 mph and I can go from talking\
  \ about the physics of time and how that relates to religion and how religion is\
  \ basically just the artistic or story interpretation of philosophy and yadadadadadda\
  \ \nBut, I mean it just my brain \n\nI didn't realize there was a \"normal\" brain\
  \ \n\nIt makes me feel really bad about myself \n\nI belong to the little cohort\
  \ of kids who never grow up \nThat's kinda what it feels like sometimes \n\nI have\
  \ the same level of curiosity as I did as a kid \nI'm about as efficient at controlling\
  \ my emotions as I was when I was a child \nI have the same energy level as I did\
  \ when I was a child \nI need the same amount of help and reassurance as I did when\
  \ I was a child \nAnd lord help me if I don't get my daily nap, or whoever tries\
  \ to interact with me \n\nI'm just a kid \nHelp me\nDon't work against me \nMy head\
  \ already does that\n\nNot being in full control of your brain is so frustrating\
  \ \nI have a constant flow of thoughts and ideas \nBut not like one thought and\
  \ then have another thought \nI think about like 3 or 4 things at once while taking\
  \ in my surroundings and interacting \nThen someone wants me to do something \n\
  Or I want to do something \nAnd I know how to do it \nIt's just a matter of accessing\
  \ the correct information \nI have to force my brain to move in a direction it didn't\
  \ want to \n\nSo then while I stand there battling with my brain and trying to get/stay\
  \ on track I stand in silence staring off into the distance looking like a god damn\
  \ fucking idiot \n\nThis is why I get depressed"
