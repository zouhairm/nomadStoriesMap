Text: I never expected to find the love and freedom to be in my trip to Russia but
  it happened, my reason for traveling was to go to a soccer game between Japan and
  Colombia but by traveling to reach my destination I discovered how wonderful it
  is to travel to know new cultures customs my first stop was in Switzerland where
  I was welcomed with open arms where I met the most decent and elegant people I could
  see in my life, the beauty of its airport that looked like a VIP room from there
  I stopped in Portugal more exactly in Lisbon where the people were happy friendly
  with the happiness that can characterize us the South Americans I found in them
  they made me feel at home and finally I left for my dreamed world-wide destiny RUSSIA
  was so excited that I did not sleep in all my trip after having traveled thousands
  of miles from New York finally this is where I always dreamed to be at the beginning
  everything was confusing I did not have the slightest idea where to go Ajaban in
  groups of 4 and 5 person I went alone but with more enthusiasm and desire to discover
  such a fascinating destination, I tried to speak in English and Spanish with different
  people but none of them understood me when I decided to use the translator of my
  telephon and that was the key to move like a fish in the water as if I had always
  lived there could go to the train station a very kind russo helped me to buy my
  ticket to reach my final destination Penza, the train trip was my first trip in
  train u was magical there are people of different nationalities like a Ukrainian
  who was my cabin mate a Chilean with whom I talked in the restaurant of the train
  and hundreds of Colombians with whom we celebrated to be fulfilling our World-wide
  dream, finally in Penza a very small and with streets or little deserted get to
  acambiarme and leave my things in the hotel because my true final destination I
  was expecting Saransk a city incredibly smaller than Penza but super modern where
  thanks to the thousands of Colombians for a moment I forgot that I was in Russia
  it seemed that the city had been small but we were happy happy we were all brothers
  friends one family away from home, where I finally discovered love if the love so
  infinite that I had very deep within me for my daughter my wife my new family in
  the distance I gave myself how much I love them that each trip I would like to have
  them by my side because without them your dreams do not live the same.
