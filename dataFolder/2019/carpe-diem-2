Text: "The doctors never believed her daughter would be able to communicate, listen\
  \ or see anything, being her death a matter of time. Sitting in a closed door room,\
  \ I listened to a woman explain how the lives of her family changed after her daughter\
  \ was born. Somehow she is already five years old and can understand what happens\
  \ around her and can express her feelings in her own way.\n\tBeing at a pediatric\
  \ hospital at Curitiba, which is located in Brazil, I was able to have contact with\
  \ this woman through my participation on a brief psychology course. It was focused\
  \ on the functions and challenges of the psychologists that work in this environment.\
  \  I studied about the hospitalizations, the subjectivities of the patients and\
  \ their families and the work that has to be done with them and with the medical\
  \ team. No class made more sense, though, than hearing the journey of this woman\
  \ from her own mouth. \n\tThe maximum time that she ever got to be home and not\
  \ interned was for 28 days, which means that this family\u2019s life has always\
  \ been at the hospital. This woman showed how difficult it is, having to be divided\
  \ between the hospital and her other two daughters. Her ex-husband couldn`t handle\
  \ the situation, never being present in the care of his youngest and even went to\
  \ live in another country.\n\tShe was fighting for the life of her child in the\
  \ only reality possible. Some might applaud her, saying that she is tough and incredibly\
  \ resilient. Others think that this is her duty as a mother and she would be weak\
  \ if she didn`t hope for the best and did all she could while keeping a smile on\
  \ her face. Personal suppositions and judgments aside, this woman showed me just\
  \ a piece of the struggle she carries every day. \n\tWhile we were in that hospital\
  \ room I only listened and what I could see in her eyes was how lucid she was of\
  \ her situation, knowing that her daughter is still expected to die in less than\
  \ five years. I wondered how she could handle her emotions and manage to do everything\
  \ in her power to give a better life for her child, not thinking the worst every\
  \ day. I thought maybe it is the presence of hope, believing that she could be cured.\
  \ But then I saw something else, the philosophy of  \u201Ccarpe diem\u201D, in which\
  \ she focus on the present and its possibilities, leaving the worries of the future\
  \ for when it comes."
