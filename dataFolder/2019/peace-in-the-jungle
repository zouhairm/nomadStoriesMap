Text: "The sanctuary became eerily quiet after the group of backpackers and Chinese\
  \ families left to continue their sightseeing in other parts of Chiang Mai. All\
  \ that was left was me, the elephant keepers, and of course the elephants. My guide\
  \ told me to relax and sit down because there wasn\u2019t anything for me to do\
  \ right now. Since I was the only visitor who opted for a full-day visit instead\
  \ of a half-day visit, I was the sole outsider to this quiet valley. \n\nUnsure\
  \ of what to do or if I should be doing anything at all, I wandered around the open-air\
  \ cafeteria reading up on the facts and myths of the Asian elephant. Five months\
  \ into a nine-month, breakneck speed backpacking tour, I was unfamiliar with just\
  \ slowing down and embracing the moment. But the warmth of the day, a full belly\
  \ of traditional Thai food, and a lack of other options had me making my way to\
  \ the hut for a rest. \n\nFollowing my guide\u2019s direction, I attempted to find\
  \ the most comfortable spot in the hut that had a front seat view to the elephants.\
  \ I wiggled myself on the thin, scratchy blanket until I found the right spot that\
  \ a piece of wood wasn\u2019t poking into my backside. Once I was finally comfortable,\
  \ I relaxed against the pillow and stared out at the elephants only a stone\u2019\
  s toss away. \n\nThe elephants were being herded back underneath a giant version\
  \ of my own covered hut so they too could take an afternoon break. As I watched\
  \ these giants of the animal kingdom, I caught myself planning my next trip in my\
  \ mind, which prompted a gentle scolding to myself to pay attention to what was\
  \ in the here and now. \n\nThe sounds of elephants munching on sugar cane stalks\
  \ and giant feet moving across the straw and dirt ground began to soothe me. An\
  \ occasional annoyed trumpet or rustling from the batting of giant ears would break\
  \ the silence. Underneath all of this was the sound of the warm Thai breeze floating\
  \ through the jungle trees. The serene valley and the realization I was laying only\
  \ yards away from one the world\u2019s most majestic creatures somehow began to\
  \ lull me to sleep.\n\nSlowly and groggily I awoke from my doze and surprisingly\
  \ found my guide had also taken an afternoon nap on the other side of the hut. Apparently,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t the only one who succumbed to the warm weather and calming atmosphere.\
  \ I turned to the elephants to find them right where I left them before I fell asleep,\
  \ munching on cane stalks and very impatient for more bananas. \n\nSmiling to myself,\
  \ I got up and stretched out the kinks that had formed from sleeping in the hut\
  \ and followed my guide to make the afternoon medicine balls for the main residents\
  \ of the sanctuary. As I was elbows deep in mushed up bananas, tree stalks, and\
  \ rice, I couldn\u2019t help but smile to myself. Here I was in the middle of northern\
  \ Thailand, covered in mud and mashed banana from feeding the elephants earlier\
  \ in the day, my phone nowhere in sight, and feeling for the first-time complete\
  \ contentment with where I was and what I was doing. A feeling I never anticipated\
  \ I would ever achieve, let alone find in a jungle valley. \n\nPeace is a funny\
  \ thing. No one knows how to describe it, how to obtain it, where to find it, or\
  \ what it really even means, but somehow, we humans go through exorbitant lengths\
  \ to obtain peace. Buddha found peace only after extreme meditation and Albert Einstein\
  \ said peace can only be achieved by understanding, not force. \n\nAnd me? \n\n\
  Dressed in an itchy romper, covered in mud, and mushing together medicine balls\
  \ for elephants, I found peace unexpectedly, for only a few hours, while sharing\
  \ the same space with one of the world\u2019s most intelligent and majestic animals."
