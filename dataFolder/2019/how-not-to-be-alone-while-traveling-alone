Text: "Always wondering how can people travel around the world by themself and not\
  \ be bored of loneliness? Read my experience bellow!\n\nWell, my story started in\
  \ the day when I decided to go travelling around Spain only by myself. All of my\
  \ friends and familiry member told me that it will be boring and that they absolutely\
  \ don't understand how and why am I going alone when I have so many enthusiatic\
  \ friends. Sounds familiar for you? Read further and you will understand why travelling\
  \ alone is the best way to travel and to make local and all around the world connection.\n\
  \nOkay, when you are not a child anymore it seems to be very diffucult to say hi\
  \ for the person on the street or even in a bar, isn't it? For us, boring adults,\
  \ someone created an amazing website \"Couchsurfing\" and, surprisely, this website\
  \ can be used not only for staying at someone home for free. While exploring some\
  \ unusual places in Barclona by Internet, I found one interesting place - view point\
  \ which name is Bunker del Carmel. I was thoungt how is it must be beatiful to see\
  \ sunset from this point, relaxing with a bottle of wine and enjoying magical Barcelona,\
  \ surronding by clear-blue sea. But there was one thing. It is not so much fun and\
  \ interesting to do it alone. So the thing which I did is creating an event on Couchsurfing!\
  \ This website has very clear and usefull tools for everyone who want to do it,\
  \ can do it. Surprisely for me around 25 people joint my event and I was very excited\
  \ to meet them all.\n\nSo, the Day X has come. Of course, I was sure that maybe\
  \ only a half of people will come or even no one. I came to the place and the first\
  \ problem was...my gps app showed me toilet as info point, so I told everyone to\
  \ come to info point, but actually it was a toilet. Well... How should I find them?\
  \ I was coming to every person on this place who looks frustrating haha, but then\
  \ people started to come! Firstly one guy found me and here I have a person from\
  \ Iceland, then came cool girl from France, after one always-talking guy from India...\
  \ And here we had a group of 12 people, who were from such a different places, different\
  \ cultures, with different wonderful stories and experiences. All the evening we\
  \ were smiling, laughing, sharing stories and jokes, drinking spanish wine and eating\
  \ dishes from all around the world. After this, we visited festival together and\
  \ were meeting with some of the guys one or more times in Barcelona.\n\nAnd here\
  \ was a story about how I met more than 10 people from all around the world in one\
  \ evening! I met these guys and spent the best time in Barcelona only because I\
  \ was travelling alone. And I know it for sure. When you are travelling with your\
  \ friends, you feel yourself absolutely comfortable and okay with that, even if\
  \ you want to meet someone, your friend may don't want to do it etc. But when you\
  \ are alone, you are already out of your comfort zone, so it is very easy and fun\
  \ to meet someone! \n\nWho knows, maybe you will become true friends with someone\
  \ (as me and one girld from Germnay) or only a week after your trip, you were showing\
  \ around Moscow to some girls from Norway, friend of which you met one these meeting?\
  \ \n\nSo, don't be scary of a people, travell, explore and make a local and international\
  \ connetions!"
