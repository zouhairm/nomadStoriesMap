Text: "I am a fan of articles or books about travel and learn about different cultures,\
  \ probably because I am an archaeologist, although not a very good one. While working\
  \ in a national research centre, I was fortunate to be able to visit various places\
  \ in my own country, Indonesia, and abroad, both as member of a research team or\
  \ as participant in seminars. Oh well, I have never travelled outside Asia, but\
  \ I feel lucky anyway. Each place has its distinct character and provides unique\
  \ experience. One of the most memorable ones is my trip with my cousin to Nepal\
  \ after attending the third World Archaeological Congress in New Delhi in December\
  \ 1994.\nMy knowledge about Nepal was almost zero then. But the film \u201CLittle\
  \ Buddha\u201D inspired me and my cousin to visit the place. The opportunity came\
  \ when a friend, an Australian archaeologist, submitted my name to his friend, who\
  \ was the organizing committee of the third WAC. The conference offered a free excursion\
  \ to the great Taj Mahal and could help arrange a post-conference tour (a not free\
  \ and unguided one) to Nepal. So off we went.\nWe arrived in New Delhi at the wee\
  \ hour of two in the morning and the airport had no written sign. Luckily I met\
  \ some Australian archaeologists whom I knew. Stepping outside from the arrival\
  \ lounge was rather horrifying because there were poor-looking people sleeping on\
  \ the terrace (and it was winter in the northern part of India).\nThe conference\
  \ itself was \u201Cokay\u201D but the venue, the Taj Palace Hotel, is beautiful.\
  \ Lunches were held on the garden, with birds swooshing around us. It was the first\
  \ time I saw the earthenware oven to cook chapatti (and I love all the local bread:\
  \ chapatti, nan, roti). Idli sambar and dahl were my favorite, too. And one afternoon\
  \ we saw a bride came to the hotel riding an ornately dressed elephant.\nAfter the\
  \ conference we flew to Nepal, and as the airplane took off, the song \u201CKathmandu\u201D\
  \ by Cat Stevens was playing in my head. It was like a magical leap into another\
  \ world. I saw mountain peaks higher than the golden clouds from the window. Breath-taking.\
  \ And during the trip from the Tribhuvan Airport to the hotel, I shrank every time\
  \ I saw electric tram turned, afraid that it would crash into our taxi. The Yak\
  \ and Yeti Hotel on Durbar Marg was very nice. And my cousin knew a GM of the Oberoi\
  \ Bali who was a friend of the hotel\u2019s GM, so we had a room at the Shangri\
  \ La Club at regular room price! With a butler, too! Plus an invitation to have\
  \ dinner with the GM and his wife at the Chimney Restaurant. To reach the restaurant\
  \ we had to walk across the lawn \u2013 it was very cold \u2013 luckily we were\
  \ given a small wool blanket as a welcome present, which we used as a shawl.\nIn\
  \ the morning we went to visit the Swayambunath, one of the holiest temples in Nepal\
  \ on top of a hill. I noticed that Buddhist monks in Nepal wear red robes instead\
  \ of orange ones worn by the monks in my country. They worship the Buddha by walking\
  \ several steps then laid their bodies facing down several times, and rang the bells.\
  \ On the four sides of the main stupa are black, white, blue, and red colored giant\
  \ pairs of Buddha eyes (the Eyes of Wisdom) with question-mark shaped nose and the\
  \ third eye as the symbol of omniscience (all-seeing) of Buddha. The next day we\
  \ visited the old city of Bhaktapur (Place of Devotees), the capital of Nepal during\
  \ the \u2018Malla Kingdom\u2019 period (until 15th century CE). The two-storey buildings\
  \ are fascinating.\nWe were not able to see the little goddess of Kumari. But I\
  \ love seeing the curving dagger, wool shawls, crafts made of lokta papers, various\
  \ fragrant incense sticks, and wooden stamps depicting Buddhist symbols (there are\
  \ many forms of \u2018yin and yang\u2019 \u2013 fishes, flowers, etc.). And the\
  \ book stores, like in India, are the best that I have seen so until now, with their\
  \ huge collections"
