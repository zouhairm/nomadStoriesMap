Text: "\"Which one of these photographs should I print?\" Vijay asks me as he sees\
  \ a tense expression on my face. I flipped through the photos on his camera screen,\
  \ reviewed them, and stopped at the one in which the entire family was squinting\
  \ against the sun\u2019s intensity, \"this one, it looks more dramatic\", I said.\n\
  \nVijay took out his portable printer from his backpack, made a 4x6 inch glossy\
  \ print and handed it to his client, who has been quietly watching the exchange\
  \ between two of us. He walked away to where his family was standing next to the\
  \ burning funeral pyre of his grandmother, with the photo held reverently in his\
  \ hand.\n\n Vijay put the princely sum of one hundred rupees into the inner pocket\
  \ of his velvet pants and sat down next to me watching the reflection of burning\
  \ pyre in the holy Ganges, shimmering in the afternoon sun. Vijay is short and chubby.\
  \ He released a dimple when he smiled revealing his reddish brown paan-stained teeth.\
  \ He covered his bald head with a wide-brimmed hat which was a gift from a Japanese\
  \ yoga teacher visiting Varanasi. \n\nI accidentally met Vijay earlier this morning\
  \ when I lost my way to the guesthouse. His make-shift studio is on the open road\
  \ with no ceiling in one of these bylanes adjoining the Ghat. On the walls of the\
  \ bylanes, Vijay displayed photographs of the young and old in different print sizes.\
  \ These photographs are of the dead people.\_People like Vijay are known as \"Death\
  \ Photographers.\"  Vijay charges a nominal fee for his services. The relatives\
  \ of the deceased requests Vijay to take a photograph for a final memory.\n\nVijay\
  \ was negotiating with a potential customer. He has cracked a deal and went towards\
  \ the family waiting on the steps of the Ghats to make the final picture of his\
  \ grandmother. Looking at my anxious face, Vijay\_asks me to\_follow him. A short\
  \ walk later, we are at his \u201Cworkplace\u201D, the\_Manikarnika\_Ghat. It is\
  \ the holiest burning ghat for the Hindus. Annually it is estimated around a hundred\
  \ thousand bodies are cremated here. The funeral parties have to wait for their\
  \ turns on the steps of the ghat. From a distance, I was observing Vijay as he was\
  \ patiently making images one after another, like an enlightened Zen master. \n\n\
  Having a camera is a luxury for him. Vijay has to juggle between his two point and\
  \ shoot cameras because one camera cannot read the card while other's display is\
  \ not working.  Lack of employment opportunities in the town is forcing many youths\
  \ to take up this difficult job. \n\nIt is the peak of summer, and it is difficult\
  \ to even stand for ten minutes as the temperatures rise over forty degrees Centigrade.\
  \ Vijay works for twelve hours every day with small breaks in between. The heat\
  \ of the burning pyres, the stench of the burning flesh, mourning relatives and\
  \ the emotional stress can drive anyone mad. A little break helps him to maintain\
  \ his sanity. \n\nIn the\_evening,\_Vijay\_took\_me for a boat ride on the river\
  \ Ganges.\_ We watched the Sun slip silently into the folds of the Earth. \n\nVijay,\
  \ does your profession affects you emotionally? I asked. \n\nHe said \"whenever\
  \ he earned more money in a day, he felt his ladder to success is dependent on the\
  \ misery of others. But now he believes that, if he has allowed his personal ambition\
  \ to overcome the genuine compassion then he would have sold his soul. Whenever\
  \ he is asked to photograph a child or a young, he never demands any money. He thinks\
  \ this is the least he can do for the grieving family. He feels it is required of\
  \ him to look at the dead body and capture it for one last time. If he doesn't,\
  \ then who will\"?"
