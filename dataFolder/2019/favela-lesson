Text: "The smell of danger could be felt it in the air, but I did not want to fall\
  \ into the prejudice of a dangerous South America. At the bus stop, a feeling of\
  \ fear enveloped me, fortunately, I was so wrong. A friend invited me to Parais\xF3\
  polis, a favela in Southern Sao Paulo City, to help as volunteer. She told me they\
  \ were looking for motivated people, the mission: to transform an empty plot into\
  \ a food producing area. But all these fear feelings dissipated out when at the\
  \ bus stop I asked an old woman about the place. Kindly she led me to a deserted\
  \ square, with children, locals and other volunteers. \nI went to Sao Paulo to study\
  \ oceanography at USP, one of the best universities in Brazil, and now I was surrounded\
  \ by a monotonous landscape, made of ocher, stacked houses. Looked like Parais\xF3\
  polis was thrown over there, and that's a favela is, an improvised city that finds\
  \ its way. This favela emerged in the 1950s as a result of the expansion of Sao\
  \ Paulo, when property prices rose. And despite some favelas are dangerous, dominated\
  \ by small criminal groups, Parais\xF3polis is different, is a kind of small city.\
  \ It reunites a low-income population far from opportunities, but eager to organize\
  \ itself and search out of solutions.\nWe did a great job, transforming this treeless\
  \ area into a green square with trees palms and vegetables and greens. When I planted\
  \ my first guava tree, between laughs and small jokes, I understood this simple\
  \ fact was going to bring more than fruits, once mature, this tree will host birds\
  \ and provide shadow.\nParais\xF3polis it\u2019s an organized community. One of\
  \ the local told me they even wanted to start a community bank, and now it amazes\
  \ me to know they did it. Around 100,000 people live there, with nearly 8,000 commercial\
  \ premises. The community managed to organize they self and were able to create\
  \ and start a local bank, with a valid currency only within the favela's boundaries.\
  \ With the interests, who are low by the way, they plan to promote other local initiatives\
  \ and social projects. Parais\xF3polis wants a sustainable community. \nParadoxically,\
  \ but not surprising, this favela is one of the biggest in Sao Paulo,  and is next\
  \ to Morumbi, one of the wealthy zone in the city. \nAfter re-greening the area,\
  \ we were invited to eat at a humble community center, a few blocks from what it\
  \ was now, a kind of small, edible park. Brazilians are sweet, they always smiles,\
  \ and happiness spring from its skin, and there, I was one more of them. We shared\
  \ laughs, experiences, an amazing feiojada and coconut juice. \nWe finished our\
  \ mission for the sunset, and we headed direction to the house of on the local to\
  \ dance and partying. With them I made a real friendship, and was always welcome\
  \ there. I can\u2019t wait to come back.\nThis favela is a life lesson, an example\
  \ of an organized and empowered community, with strong desire to break down prejudices.\
  \ I forgot to mention it, Parais\xF3polis means paradise city."
